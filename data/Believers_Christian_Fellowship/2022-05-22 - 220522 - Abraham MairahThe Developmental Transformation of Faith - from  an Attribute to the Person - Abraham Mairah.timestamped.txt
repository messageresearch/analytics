[18:34] into
[18:35] [Music]
[18:37] the chamber
[18:40] be free
[18:45] [Music]
[18:46] speak
[18:47] to
[18:49] me gently
[18:51] [Music]
[19:07] is
[19:09] [Music]
[19:22] i even
[19:24] want screeching in the name of jesus
[19:26] christ and
[19:28] if everybody is doing fine
[19:31] what else can we do
[19:34] because
[19:35] we are a trophies of
[19:37] his sacrifice his love
[19:41] and
[19:42] we thank god that we are one of
[19:45] of those
[19:46] that he has saved
[19:48] throughout
[19:50] you know
[19:51] christian though
[19:53] and um
[19:54] certainly
[19:56] maybe you'll be seated for a moment a
[19:58] minute
[19:58] i just
[20:02] wanted to appreciate all of you and
[20:06] especially
[20:08] the grace of god and of course pastor
[20:10] chad for inviting me of course
[20:12] if he doesn't invite me i can't come
[20:16] so
[20:18] so he's the key here so
[20:21] yeah
[20:22] so
[20:24] i can't forget that so sometimes i ask
[20:27] him why do you invite me what do you
[20:28] think
[20:30] i i have but maybe
[20:32] you know like we were interrupting
[20:35] some kind of serious talk one time a day
[20:38] migration first time i think i came to
[20:40] the us and
[20:41] that immigration officials asking me can
[20:44] you tell me why
[20:46] they had to invite you to come and
[20:47] preach in the united states
[20:50] don't we have preachers in the u.s
[20:55] so
[20:56] i was like my guest is as good as yours
[21:03] i also don't know
[21:05] why they invited me
[21:08] they say i'm serious you have to tell me
[21:11] why do they have to invite you all the
[21:14] way from uganda
[21:16] i said i guess it's because i also
[21:19] invited him and maybe he wanted me also
[21:22] over here he said i can't understand you
[21:25] have to explain more
[21:28] so he went on and went on and went and
[21:31] he was really insisting and he asked me
[21:33] questions about my view about the
[21:36] trinity and blabla
[21:38] it was quite funny
[21:44] so and then he kept checking my bible to
[21:46] see if i've ever marked it or i'm some
[21:48] kind of mascaretta pretending to be a
[21:50] preacher
[21:53] so then eventually he said i don't
[21:55] believe you're a preacher although your
[21:57] bible is marked i said well you get a
[21:59] room i preached to you as someone
[22:07] and then his friend was smiling at him
[22:09] you know and
[22:11] if you want to prove our preacher then
[22:13] we get somewhere i preach you someone
[22:15] and
[22:16] you'll believe i'm a preacher
[22:20] so and then it went on he was insisting
[22:23] and then
[22:24] i said i think to answer your question
[22:27] let me also ask you a question you know
[22:29] kind of what i was preaching the other
[22:32] day the other night
[22:33] jesus answering the question with the
[22:35] question so i said
[22:38] you people in europe and america here
[22:40] you are always
[22:42] signing
[22:43] players from africa
[22:45] i mean you you you you support a good
[22:48] talent of a footballer
[22:51] a good runner whatever
[22:54] you get them from africa and you bring
[22:55] them here
[22:57] and they play for you
[22:58] and when they score it's not nigeria or
[23:01] ghana or cameroon or uganda scoring
[23:04] it's britain it's america
[23:07] is it because you don't have men here
[23:10] who can play football
[23:20] so
[23:20] his friend said today you got more than
[23:23] a match
[23:25] [Applause]
[23:28] so i said i guess should be the same way
[23:30] the same
[23:32] you know where it applies maybe the
[23:34] brother has seen something that's why he
[23:36] wanted me to come
[23:38] not because i'm special not because i'm
[23:40] better than the americans so
[23:43] well i was just on the point that i
[23:45] don't know why brother chad keeps
[23:47] inviting but me i know why will invite
[23:49] him so
[23:51] so but i am certainly humbled by your
[23:54] love
[23:55] and your concern and
[23:57] especially for those who have come from
[23:59] different places i
[24:01] i was really
[24:02] you know
[24:03] humbled my brothers who've come all the
[24:05] way i can see my friend you know
[24:08] who traveled from canada is it
[24:11] toronto is it and others have come from
[24:14] very far
[24:15] and then i was like
[24:16] my who am i
[24:18] this brothers came and sisters from
[24:20] verify so may god bless you so much and
[24:24] the saints here at lima you know that
[24:27] you have a special place in my heart in
[24:29] our hearts back home we have you and we
[24:32] always pray for you the best gift
[24:35] that you can give me
[24:37] is if i can see you in the rapture
[24:40] if i can see your face that that
[24:42] particular moment when and then we shall
[24:44] say you made it brother
[24:47] you married sister
[24:49] all that we've gone through all that you
[24:52] hear all that
[24:53] it doesn't matter
[24:56] but what matters is when you are
[24:58] there and nobody will ever push you back
[25:03] nobody will say you didn't qualify to
[25:05] come to heaven go back
[25:08] you have made it
[25:10] and no brother brahma says we are going
[25:12] to meet there are people we didn't
[25:14] expect
[25:15] and then the people that you expect to
[25:17] be there will not be there
[25:20] so maybe someone doesn't expect you'll
[25:22] be there but you'll be there
[25:24] and i think that is the best thing if
[25:26] you are a surprise to that person
[25:29] that he didn't expect you to be there
[25:30] but then you are there
[25:32] so just have a good deal with your god
[25:35] you are with your lord that lord i want
[25:36] to be there i want to be one of those
[25:40] maybe people don't want maybe some
[25:42] people would not
[25:43] be comfortable if i'm there but i don't
[25:46] know that he doesn't even have to
[25:47] consult anybody to take you there
[25:52] and he never consulted anybody in saving
[25:55] you he doesn't even make an application
[25:58] to your family
[26:01] if he wants to save you
[26:03] so he did it
[26:05] and we really love the lord thank the
[26:06] lord for that
[26:08] so it has really been a privilege for me
[26:10] and uh
[26:12] limas turned out to be something special
[26:14] for me so i appreciate sister angie you
[26:17] know she's always very busy knocking
[26:19] things up and down and burning her
[26:21] fingers
[26:22] you know
[26:23] just to make me comfortable
[26:25] and um they are just a special couple i
[26:28] appreciate them and
[26:29] and then
[26:30] well maybe you don't see that but me i
[26:32] see it so
[26:34] so
[26:35] i i really appreciate them and the whole
[26:38] family
[26:39] and and the youngest is always my
[26:42] closest friend there i always say
[26:46] yeah
[26:47] so i was enjoying the fellowship with
[26:49] them so certainly friends i may not have
[26:52] time to meet each one of you
[26:55] but you know that you're special to me
[26:56] in my heart
[26:58] and they will always list for your
[27:00] prayers that you pray for us
[27:03] we pray for one another
[27:05] we don't expect to stay here so long
[27:09] no
[27:10] we are going home
[27:12] we are already in the thing
[27:17] the move is on
[27:19] so may god bless you so much
[27:22] and maybe we can stand up and have a
[27:24] word of prayer
[27:30] loving heavenly father i want to thank
[27:32] you for such a good morning that you've
[27:35] given us and
[27:37] the privilege to be in the house of the
[27:38] lord for there are many who have wanted
[27:40] to be there
[27:42] but maybe they have been impeded by all
[27:44] forms of
[27:45] obstacles sicknesses accidents
[27:48] emergencies

[27:51] the grace to be here

[29:28] in jesus name we pray
[29:30] amen
[29:32] while we are still standing i think i
[29:34] wanted to read some scripture here in
[29:35] the book of romans
[29:37] which i'll have to compare it with other
[29:40] scriptures
[29:41] i think which are you
[29:43] allow me to read before you see it
[29:46] in romans chapter three from verse one
[29:48] to three
[29:53] it says
[29:55] what advantage then have they do
[30:00] or what prophet is there of circumcision
[30:06] much every way she flee
[30:09] because that unto them were committed
[30:12] the oracles of god
[30:20] for what if some did not believe
[30:24] shall their unbelief make the faith of
[30:28] god without effect
[30:31] god forbid
[30:33] yeah let god be true
[30:37] but every man
[30:38] a liar
[30:41] i cannot just end there and we got the
[30:43] book of james
[30:45] chapter 2 verse 1.
[30:55] james chapter 2 verse 1 he says my
[30:57] brethren
[31:00] have not the faith
[31:03] of our lord jesus christ
[31:05] the lord of glory
[31:07] with respect
[31:09] of persons
[31:12] and finally
[31:14] in the book of luke chapter 18
[31:22] luke chapter 18
[31:25] verse 8
[31:27] i want to pick just part b
[31:30] which says
[31:31] nevertheless
[31:34] when the son of man cometh
[31:37] shall he find faith
[31:41] on earth
[31:43] may god bless his word and bless you may
[31:45] be seated
[31:54] i think we know very well one of the
[31:56] purposes of the malachi foreign ministry
[31:58] was to restore the children back
[32:02] to the faith
[32:04] of their fathers the apostles
[32:09] and faith is very important
[32:12] of course when i talk about faith i'm
[32:14] talking about revelation
[32:15] and the prophet says the importance of
[32:17] revelation can never be overemphasized
[32:25] and then the bible comes and brings a
[32:27] very strong statement of about faith and
[32:30] says
[32:31] faith is our victory
[32:37] and without victory we are not going to
[32:39] sit with christ in his throne because
[32:42] revelation 3 verse 21 he says he that
[32:45] overcometh
[32:47] shall i grant that you'll sit with me
[32:50] in my throne
[32:54] like i have overcome and i'm sat with my
[32:57] father in his throne
[33:01] now i mean the bible doesn't say on my
[33:04] throat
[33:05] in my throne
[33:08] i mean you don't sit in the throne
[33:12] you sit on but the bible uses the word
[33:15] in
[33:16] because it's a domain
[33:24] it's not a regular seat
[33:28] so that throne is a domain so you sit in
[33:32] but now before you can sit where he sat
[33:35] or where he's sitting you must overcome
[33:38] and how do you overcome you overcome by
[33:40] faith
[33:45] and then it would be like common sense
[33:47] it could be like a generally accepted
[33:50] statement that all message believers
[33:53] have got faith
[33:57] and yes they have got faith
[34:02] but we are not going to overcome by the
[34:05] faith that we have got
[34:11] because the faith that you've got you
[34:13] can lose it
[34:17] that's why you have had people
[34:19] men of faith women of faith believers
[34:22] who believed
[34:24] the word
[34:28] just like when i was here the last time
[34:30] i was talking about that scripture in
[34:32] romans chapter 10 verse 17 which says
[34:34] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[34:37] the word of god not hearing the word of
[34:39] god but by the word of god
[34:43] so faith comes by hearing and hearing
[34:47] the word
[34:49] so you hear the word by the word not by
[34:52] the ear
[34:55] because if it was just hearing by the
[34:57] ear everybody who hears the word of god
[34:59] preached
[35:01] would have faith
[35:05] but there are those who can sit hundreds
[35:08] maybe not hundreds tens and tens of
[35:10] years hearing the word being preached by
[35:13] they don't have that particular faith
[35:16] that overcomes the world
[35:20] until the world eventually overcomes
[35:23] them and you wonder why the world
[35:25] overcame them and yet they had faith in
[35:27] the world
[35:32] because when you got the bible in the
[35:34] book of mark i think if i can i have
[35:36] some some time to read that if you go to
[35:38] the book of monks chapter 9
[35:41] mark chapter 9 we see
[35:44] the wickednesses the limitations of
[35:47] money faith
[35:48] because here he says in mark chapter 9
[35:53] verse 23 jesus says unto him if thou
[35:56] cast believe all things are possible to
[35:58] them that to him that believeth
[36:02] and then you look at this man answering
[36:05] from the sincerity of his heart and he
[36:06] says straight away the father of the
[36:08] child cried out and said
[36:09] we
[36:11] tears lord i believe
[36:14] help thou my unbelief
[36:19] so the faith of a human being is always
[36:22] mixed with unbelief
[36:25] and they're afraid to fail
[36:27] i believe help my own belief
[36:36] so today i'm talking about the
[36:38] developmental transformation of faith
[36:42] you can put a dash
[36:44] from an attribute or a vacuum to the
[36:47] person
[36:54] because when we come here this man is
[36:57] saying i believe but help my unbelief
[36:59] and jesus actually just helped him
[37:02] his faith was not sufficient but he
[37:04] believed
[37:05] that's why he brought his daughter to
[37:06] jesus he believed jesus could heal him
[37:10] that's why you have come that's why we
[37:12] are here we believe the world we believe
[37:14] the message but we have to go beyond
[37:16] faces to develop
[37:20] you are not going to remain with the
[37:21] other faith that you started when having
[37:23] when you came to believe this message
[37:25] if you remain like that you will fail
[37:30] and that's why many like we have been
[37:32] following it up this week have always
[37:34] believed and ended on the office of the
[37:36] prophet the prophet said this the
[37:38] prophet said this the prophet said this
[37:40] and then if there is something that they
[37:42] think is not rhyming up right then they
[37:44] begin to fault the prophet like we're
[37:47] saying
[37:48] and this is just he was a victim like
[37:51] i'm a victim i cannot preach as a victim
[37:54] unlike you a victim and if we are
[37:56] victims who is the culprit
[38:01] are we going to make god a culprit
[38:04] because you never chose yourself you
[38:07] never
[38:07] brought yourself you never looked for
[38:09] god god looked for you and and god
[38:12] served you
[38:13] i never made myself a preacher
[38:17] like you know we saw yesterday amos was
[38:19] saying i was a gatherer of scammer fruit
[38:24] i was a husband
[38:26] i had my own plans
[38:31] and god followed me and called me and
[38:32] made me a prophet
[38:35] so i'm a victim man amaziah leave me
[38:38] alone
[38:41] i only come with that say the lord when
[38:44] he sends me if he doesn't send me i'm as
[38:46] dumb as anybody
[38:49] i have nothing of myself of my own of my
[38:52] only making but if the lion has sword if
[38:55] the lord god has spoken who can but
[38:57] prophesy
[39:02] glory be to god
[39:04] now i want us to look at this
[39:06] like paul is saying for what if some of
[39:09] them did not believe they did not
[39:11] believe what they claim to believe and
[39:13] they thought they believed but they
[39:14] didn't believe because they thought they
[39:16] believed
[39:23] i'm not good tanker twister because
[39:25] english knows my language but i think
[39:27] you are looking at what i'm
[39:28] thinking what i'm saying
[39:30] that's because they thought they
[39:31] believed that's how they failed to
[39:32] believe
[39:34] and i don't want you to sit here and
[39:36] think you believe
[39:38] and then you are defeated by you have
[39:39] ever thought thinking that you believe
[39:41] when you don't believe
[39:45] so what is the faith
[39:48] what is the faith that will overcome the
[39:50] world
[39:52] because the prophet says you come to
[39:55] receive the word by our faith that's an
[39:57] attribute something that god put in you
[39:59] that's why you say today i'm going to
[40:01] believe oh when you hear the word of god
[40:03] something deep in you clicks and tells
[40:05] you this is the truth
[40:07] but yes because you know this the truth
[40:09] doesn't make it the faith that will
[40:10] overcome the world
[40:12] and that's why very many people he had a
[40:14] bible being preached and they know this
[40:16] is the truth they know this message is
[40:18] true but that's not enough
[40:20] somehow somewhere they hit a snag on
[40:22] their
[40:23] kaput finished
[40:27] and then you begin to wonder this man i
[40:29] thought i had faith i thought his
[40:31] brother was strong i thought his sister
[40:32] was strong what was the problem
[40:36] they are
[40:37] in to develop
[40:44] so now it has to be god's own
[40:47] prevailing faith
[40:49] that's as
[40:51] fading
[40:52] faith
[40:59] so today
[41:00] we are trying to look at this because i
[41:02] want you to look at this
[41:04] as the bible saying jesus said when the
[41:06] son of man cometh shall he find faith he
[41:09] doesn't say hell shall he find a church
[41:12] with faith shalom shall he find believe
[41:15] us shall he find men of faith preachers
[41:18] of faith
[41:19] no
[41:20] shall he find faith so faith is
[41:24] identified as a person
[41:32] oh brother abraham i have a lot of faith
[41:35] you can have a lot of faith but today
[41:37] and then tomorrow you can have a lot of
[41:38] unbelief
[41:43] that's why we are getting shaken up by
[41:45] some of the things that are happening
[41:47] around the world you wake up and you
[41:49] hear like it's
[41:52] out of the blue something has happened
[41:55] and you wonder
[41:57] if this man this great man you know in
[41:59] africa they have a language especially
[42:02] south africa and like nigeria and
[42:05] zimbabwe they love the the one man of
[42:08] god you know
[42:10] great man of god
[42:12] man of faith
[42:14] and then tomorrow you wake up a great
[42:16] man of god is finished
[42:20] what happened
[42:21] what's going on
[42:23] something's wrong somewhere
[42:27] but you have to look at this because
[42:29] when you come here the bible is saying
[42:32] in the book of romans as we read the
[42:34] bible saying
[42:35] let's just look closely at vastly he
[42:38] says for what if somebody did not
[42:40] believe
[42:48] and yet
[42:49] you thought they believed
[42:51] or they thought they believed
[42:54] just because they were used by nature
[42:57] they received the oracles
[42:59] that's too that's what he was saying
[43:02] what made them stand out from the rest
[43:03] of the world they received
[43:08] the oracles of god were committed under
[43:10] them
[43:13] just like with the message has been
[43:14] committed on to us
[43:16] we have it we hate we receive it it's
[43:18] here
[43:21] but that's that guarantee that because
[43:24] you have received the oracles the word
[43:26] of god
[43:28] does it make you a believer
[43:30] does it make you faith
[43:33] no
[43:37] what about the children of israel when
[43:39] they left egypt whether they believe us
[43:41] they will believe us
[43:42] but where did the any belief that was
[43:45] manifested in the wilderness come from
[43:49] yet they left us believers of the
[43:50] message
[43:52] of moses
[43:54] but out of the believers of the message
[43:56] only two men they reached the promised
[43:57] land
[44:00] some things
[44:01] somewhere there a mystery
[44:04] so he says
[44:05] much as the oracles were given to them
[44:08] what if some of them didn't believe
[44:10] yet the oracles have been given
[44:12] they have the oracle
[44:15] what if some did not believe now listen
[44:18] shall their unbelief make the faith of
[44:20] god without effect
[44:23] now he doesn't serve the faith of the
[44:25] church
[44:30] it's not the faith of the church anymore
[44:33] it's not the faith of the believer
[44:35] anymore
[44:38] it's the faith of god
[44:42] so what is going to stand what's going
[44:45] to prevail it will be the faith of god
[44:48] in the midst of all any belief
[44:52] perfect and belief
[44:55] whether the whole world
[44:57] is
[44:58] unbelievers
[44:59] but the faith of god is a man in a woman
[45:02] in that girl and that boy will stand
[45:05] and it will have its effect
[45:08] regardless
[45:10] so what is required now is not the faith
[45:13] of mahera the faith of brother chad the
[45:15] faith of brother kyle brother and so the
[45:17] faith of sister so and so that sister
[45:19] has got faith her brother has got faith
[45:21] oh brother i have great faith i have a
[45:23] faith i have faith today you have faith
[45:24] tomorrow you are weakening
[45:26] today you are very strong in the faith
[45:28] tomorrow you are weak oh brother my
[45:30] faith has dwindled why you just heard it
[45:37] you had an attribute
[45:39] but now it has to go to the person
[45:43] and this person called the faith
[45:47] will not bother
[45:49] will not be intimidated will not be
[45:51] silenced will not be subdued by any any
[45:55] belief
[45:56] by any opposition by all doubts
[46:00] because the faith of god himself
[46:03] god himself in a human being god
[46:06] believing his own word like brother
[46:08] abraham said
[46:09] it's not you is the believers the holy
[46:11] ghost they believe in you it's not you
[46:15] you cannot that's why those who use
[46:17] their brains cannot
[46:19] they go somewhere so far so good and so
[46:22] far so hard and now i give up
[46:33] so the faith has to develop
[46:36] otherwise we are doomed
[46:39] like you have seen so many doomed and i
[46:42] think it's happening our eyes to realize
[46:44] that not all who say they had their
[46:47] faith
[46:48] had that real faith
[46:52] they had the faith of just having
[46:55] beneficiaries recipients of the oracles
[46:58] that were committed unto them
[47:00] like the oracles were given to the
[47:02] children of israel but not all of them
[47:04] who received the oracles
[47:06] had faith
[47:11] so the bible is very clear here
[47:14] what if some didn't
[47:17] what if some did not believe
[47:20] shall their unbelief make the faith of
[47:23] god without effect god forbid
[47:28] every man is a lawyer
[47:32] a liar a faker a masquerader a pretender
[47:39] every man will try to show you that he's
[47:41] right
[47:42] every man will try to show you that he's
[47:44] serious every man even you yourself can
[47:46] deceive yourself
[47:50] you can try to encourage yourself come
[47:52] on man i'm a man of god come on
[47:56] i think i love god
[47:59] i think
[48:00] i think of the elect said it
[48:03] i should be that pride i think if i hold
[48:06] my hands like this and clap
[48:08] maybe if i go down on my knees and pray
[48:10] i think i should be a believer you can
[48:12] deceive by yourself by those kind of
[48:16] whatever it
[48:18] is but when it's going to happen
[48:21] according to you and that's what the
[48:23] purpose of all this preaching has been
[48:24] going on you see like you have been
[48:26] showing here a quote on the screen jesus
[48:29] had the perfect faith because he was the
[48:30] one and when you keep receiving the word
[48:32] receiving the word you become the word
[48:34] and when the word becomes you then the
[48:37] faith perfect faith of jesus christ
[48:39] himself is tough and according to you
[48:42] because jesus had perfect faith because
[48:44] he was the fullness of the words
[48:47] and the fullness of the word in its
[48:49] entirety in you
[48:52] forms faith
[48:59] and that's why time comes you begin to
[49:01] see people beginning to doubt part of
[49:04] the word
[49:05] and yet there were men of faith in the
[49:07] word
[49:09] so what happens
[49:12] they don't have the faith
[49:14] they don't have the faith of god they
[49:16] have their own faith
[49:18] and because they have their own faith
[49:20] they have their own revelation
[49:24] and they begin to talk about their own
[49:26] revelation the way they know they see
[49:28] this they see that they see that because
[49:30] they have their own faith
[49:33] but when you have the faith of god you
[49:35] have god it's revelation when you have
[49:37] the faith of jesus you have the
[49:38] revelation of jesus christ and you
[49:40] become the unfailing
[49:43] of jesus christ the uninvading of god
[49:46] the word
[49:50] and what are you living for you are
[49:51] living for the unevading of the words
[49:55] you are no longer yourself you are no
[49:57] longer for yourself you are no longer
[49:59] for your interests it's just the
[50:00] animating of the words
[50:06] faith of god
[50:09] from an attribute from a vacuum to a
[50:11] person
[50:12] now let us look at this
[50:16] so the fact is established
[50:19] and james the pastor of jerusalem what
[50:22] did he say he says don't have the faith
[50:24] of jesus christ
[50:26] don't have the faith of our lord jesus
[50:28] christ with that is the lord of glory
[50:31] with respect of persons
[50:37] you know we had a lot of respect of
[50:39] persons in the message
[50:42] who is who who to deal with who not to
[50:44] deal with
[50:46] who qualifies who doesn't qualify
[50:54] and then there was a lot of major wraps
[50:58] let's go to second corinthians
[51:01] i want to show you something here
[51:05] that is always
[51:06] synonymous with many faith
[51:18] secret corinthians 7 10 let's begin from
[51:20] verse 12 he says
[51:23] for we dare not make ourselves of the
[51:25] number
[51:28] so in the days of paul there was a
[51:29] number
[51:30] and paul the messenger was now already
[51:32] excluded from that number because he
[51:34] doesn't say i am part of the number
[51:40] the messenger
[51:42] he say we dare not make ourselves of the
[51:45] number
[51:46] or compare ourselves with some that
[51:48] command themselves
[51:51] they command themselves
[51:55] but they
[51:56] measuring themselves by themselves they
[51:59] don't measure themselves by christ
[52:02] but they measure themselves by
[52:04] themselves
[52:08] the revelation according to brother son
[52:10] so if you preach it like him
[52:16] if you don't
[52:22] hey
[52:28] they measuring themselves by themselves
[52:31] and comparing themselves among
[52:33] themselves
[52:35] hey
[52:37] they are prudent isn't it
[52:39] they are intellectual they are spiritual
[52:40] they are perfect no they are not wise
[52:46] but they think they are wise
[52:50] because they are trying to set a certain
[52:52] measure
[52:53] you have to be like the other one
[52:56] or you are nothing
[52:58] so whatever you do you are compared by
[53:00] the other one
[53:01] measured by the other one preach it like
[53:04] him be like him talk like him
[53:07] present it like him or you're nothing
[53:10] you have to be of that number
[53:13] and if you don't come to that number you
[53:15] are nothing but jesus says the five-fold
[53:18] ministry brings us to the stage of the
[53:20] measure of the fullness of christ
[53:29] so now the backsliding comes right in
[53:31] the minister of paul and paul is saying
[53:33] he's excluded from that number they were
[53:35] already those preachers who were already
[53:38] in a particular number numbered
[53:43] and you have to be part of that number
[53:46] if you are to be amounting to anything
[53:48] if you don't you are not included in
[53:49] that number you are nothing
[53:54] and paul says we dare not
[53:58] i dare not
[54:00] who are they we paul is talking about
[54:02] the rejected ones
[54:07] i must go and preach it there out here
[54:12] like we've seen yesterday
[54:15] we dare not make ourselves of
[54:18] their number or compare ourselves with
[54:21] some that command themselves but they
[54:24] measuring themselves by themselves
[54:25] comparing themselves among themselves
[54:28] are not wise listen but
[54:31] we will not boast of things without our
[54:33] measure
[54:34] but according to the measure of the rule
[54:36] which god has distributed to us a
[54:39] measure to reach even unto you
[54:45] blessed be the name of the lord
[54:47] so paul was keeping himself within the
[54:49] confines of the means of the rule that
[54:51] god had given him
[54:52] but others had gone to the measure that
[54:54] man had said
[54:59] and when you want to live a life
[55:01] of the faith set
[55:03] faith measure set by man
[55:06] and then you are comfortable within that
[55:08] realm and you think because i'm
[55:10] fulfilling the measures the requirements
[55:12] of the faith measure that man has set i
[55:14] am okay for you
[55:20] and then you begin to compare yourself
[55:22] among others in that number and then you
[55:25] measure up you try to square up and say
[55:27] yes i think i'm almost like him
[55:31] i'm almost like him
[55:35] so some of these backslidings going
[55:38] around that's some of these shocker
[55:40] events i just opened our eyes to know
[55:42] that there is no man
[55:45] you should measure up to
[55:49] there is no man's faith you can copy and
[55:53] paste
[55:56] no man is lifestyle
[55:59] there is only one man who never failed
[56:03] and that is jesus christ
[56:04] and that's the faith of jesus christ
[56:07] that you have to get in here
[56:15] glory be to god
[56:17] okay
[56:18] now in verse 14 he says
[56:21] for we stretch not ourselves beyond our
[56:23] measure
[56:25] so god knows there is a certain measure
[56:27] you are supposed to be and within that
[56:30] measure he is able to give you
[56:32] sufficient grace to receive that faith
[56:35] the faith of jesus christ the faith of
[56:37] god but you are there business
[56:38] stretching yourself beyond the measure
[56:41] god gave you
[56:42] wasting time
[56:47] and paul is saying we stretching out
[56:49] ourselves beyond
[56:51] our measure
[56:53] as though we reach not unto you for we
[56:56] have come as far as to you also in
[56:59] preaching the gospel in other words
[57:02] god has come as far as use this simple
[57:04] local ministry to come as far as to you
[57:08] and then you have received the preaching
[57:10] of the gospel
[57:11] you know this word
[57:13] there's something beyond the life of man
[57:16] that you need now
[57:20] blessed be the name of the lord and then
[57:22] he says in an animal
[57:25] 15 he says
[57:27] not bursting of things without that is
[57:30] outside our measure beyond our measure
[57:33] that is of other main israelis
[57:39] so and so labeled so and so was great so
[57:42] and so was powerful yes that was his
[57:44] measure
[57:46] so keep keep referring to it to your own
[57:49] parent that's not you
[57:55] god deals with individuals he doesn't
[57:57] deal with groups
[57:59] i remain his labors i am under the
[58:02] minister of son so i i the other man of
[58:05] god is so decent that
[58:11] that is another man laboring
[58:15] that is not your measure
[58:17] that's not your portion
[58:20] where is your abortion
[58:24] what have you done where are you
[58:26] standing
[58:27] what is your relationship with god
[58:30] there is no man who is going to be like
[58:32] a booster for network
[58:35] that you have to connect through him to
[58:36] god
[58:42] oh
[58:44] i wish you know i i don't know how to
[58:46] bring it
[58:47] may god help me
[58:52] not bursting
[58:54] you know
[58:55] of things without or outside damage that
[58:58] is of other main is neighbors
[59:01] but having hope
[59:03] now listen he's writing to believers
[59:05] these corinthians were believers this is
[59:07] already a church
[59:09] but listen what he says having hope
[59:12] that when your faith is increased
[59:17] developed
[59:19] growing
[59:20] into that which is supposed to be
[59:24] they were already believers of the
[59:25] message
[59:29] so they didn't have that faith
[59:32] by default
[59:35] like the baptist would want to tell you
[59:37] that when you believe you receive the
[59:39] holy spirit
[59:42] no
[59:44] have you received the holy spirit since
[59:47] not when
[59:50] you believed
[59:52] hey
[59:53] and then there are those who say when
[59:55] you receive the word you've received it
[59:57] you've got the faith you don't need
[59:59] anything no
[1:00:02] when your faith is
[1:00:04] increased
[1:00:05] how does it increase the word growing in
[1:00:08] you as you keep receiving the word
[1:00:12] becoming the word you are becoming the
[1:00:14] faith
[1:00:15] because faith is the word
[1:00:22] so he says when your faith is increased
[1:00:25] that we shall be enlarged by you
[1:00:30] according to our rule abundantly now who
[1:00:33] is going to analyze the minister of paul
[1:00:36] you who is going to enlighten the
[1:00:38] minister of william branham the
[1:00:40] recipients of the message when
[1:00:43] the word
[1:00:45] increases on the face of god the faith
[1:00:48] of jesus whom
[1:00:50] he introduced
[1:00:52] gets established
[1:00:54] so it's no longer the church believing
[1:00:56] now you stop putting there your
[1:00:58] ideologies
[1:00:59] your thinking
[1:01:01] your feelings
[1:01:03] your likes and dislikes
[1:01:06] and you let him have his way
[1:01:09] let him believe his word let him do what
[1:01:11] he wants to do
[1:01:13] forget about you what you know the
[1:01:15] doctor told me abcd
[1:01:17] if the bible says by his tribes i am
[1:01:20] healed
[1:01:21] and if i am
[1:01:22] i is
[1:01:25] if i am i is
[1:01:28] if that is english anyway
[1:01:32] i stop thinking
[1:01:34] i don't put there my mind
[1:01:36] i don't even think about the pain i
[1:01:38] don't think about the fact that i'm
[1:01:40] still lame if the world says i'm healed
[1:01:42] i is
[1:01:44] that it let him let him take over that
[1:01:47] it's not me believing his word is
[1:01:49] himself bringing the word and with him
[1:01:52] all things are possible i just step back
[1:02:00] i i just say cast be my thoughts
[1:02:04] i remove them
[1:02:06] my feelings
[1:02:08] what i know
[1:02:15] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:02:17] glory be to god and he says this is i
[1:02:21] mean this is the reason
[1:02:24] that you know
[1:02:26] we must have fooled in him
[1:02:29] you know we must be found in him and
[1:02:31] this is what paulus provost let me give
[1:02:34] you just a couple more
[1:02:35] scriptures and then we shall proceed
[1:02:38] when you come to revelation i mean
[1:02:39] philippians philippians chapter three
[1:02:41] let's see paul's wish
[1:02:44] philippians chapter 3 verse 9 he says
[1:02:49] and
[1:02:50] be
[1:02:51] phone
[1:02:52] in him
[1:02:54] be found in him
[1:02:56] not having my own righteousness and of
[1:03:00] course you know righteousness is faith
[1:03:02] abraham believed the god and it was
[1:03:04] imputed unto him for faith
[1:03:07] not having my own righteousness my own
[1:03:11] faith
[1:03:13] which is of the law that's the letter
[1:03:16] i have the word i know the word i read
[1:03:19] the message i listen to tips
[1:03:21] so that is the reason that that's what
[1:03:23] that's the evidence that i have faith no
[1:03:26] that's yours
[1:03:31] but
[1:03:32] that which is through
[1:03:35] the faith of christ
[1:03:38] who is christ the anointed one the
[1:03:41] anointed word not a dominant word a word
[1:03:45] in action so that faith of christ
[1:03:51] active faith
[1:03:53] faith is a fact but faith is also an act
[1:04:01] not having my own righteousness which is
[1:04:03] of the lord a letter but i which is
[1:04:05] through the faith of christ the
[1:04:08] righteousness which is of god by faith
[1:04:12] which face the faith of christ in you
[1:04:20] and if if we got also revelation chapter
[1:04:22] 14
[1:04:23] and and maybe end it there with
[1:04:26] scriptures then we continue somewhere
[1:04:27] else if you find here in revelation
[1:04:29] chapter 14
[1:04:31] verse 12
[1:04:34] revelation 14 12 this is what he says
[1:04:37] here is the patience of the saints
[1:04:42] here are they
[1:04:44] that keep the commands of commandments
[1:04:47] of god
[1:04:49] and the faith of jesus
[1:04:53] keep it
[1:04:57] not the faith of our church
[1:05:00] our church we believe this
[1:05:04] no
[1:05:05] not the faith of the messiah believers
[1:05:11] but the faith of jesus
[1:05:14] keep it
[1:05:16] patiently
[1:05:20] glory be to god
[1:05:22] so
[1:05:23] they handle belief of some who claim to
[1:05:25] believe that means you can put in
[1:05:27] brackets they make believers and
[1:05:28] unbelievers they claim
[1:05:32] what if some did not believe
[1:05:35] does it stop
[1:05:36] you who has the faith of god in
[1:05:38] operation no
[1:05:41] we shall keep moving on
[1:05:45] now let me go on something i want us to
[1:05:48] you know to lay foundation on strongly
[1:05:51] let's go to the book of jude
[1:05:54] judy verse 3 it's jordan just one
[1:05:57] chapter
[1:05:59] beloved
[1:06:02] when i gave all diligence to write unto
[1:06:04] you all free common salvation
[1:06:11] i don't know about america but back then
[1:06:13] in africa everybody wants to say praise
[1:06:15] the lord even catholics these days and
[1:06:16] protesters everywhere on the field
[1:06:18] praise the lord we thank god we are
[1:06:20] saved by grace god is good all the time
[1:06:23] and all the time god is good and that is
[1:06:25] man is nature
[1:06:29] come on
[1:06:33] well that is common salvation but there
[1:06:34] is something packaged within within it
[1:06:37] and he says
[1:06:40] it was needful for me to write unto you
[1:06:42] and to exalt you now listen that you
[1:06:46] should
[1:06:47] honestly
[1:06:49] contend
[1:06:51] for their faith not our faith
[1:06:57] that faith
[1:06:58] that's the faith of jesus christ
[1:07:01] which was delivered unto the saints and
[1:07:04] i want you to mark everybody there that
[1:07:07] faith
[1:07:08] which was delivered
[1:07:13] not manufactured
[1:07:16] not developed by man
[1:07:19] in other words it was a product made
[1:07:21] from heaven and put in a delivery van
[1:07:24] and the delivery van brought it and
[1:07:26] delivered to you
[1:07:28] [Applause]
[1:07:32] made somewhere else
[1:07:35] not made me in the pca fellowship here
[1:07:41] made there
[1:07:44] and then delivered
[1:07:47] not to the hypocrites make believers
[1:07:53] not to the church members
[1:07:56] not the believers
[1:07:59] but to the saints
[1:08:01] sanctified ones
[1:08:03] [Music]
[1:08:05] yeah so look at the criteria criteria
[1:08:07] now
[1:08:10] faith
[1:08:11] that was once delivered to the saints
[1:08:15] glory to god
[1:08:18] and i want us to look at this
[1:08:22] carefully
[1:08:24] who delivered this faith
[1:08:30] who delivered it
[1:08:32] we know to whom it was delivered
[1:08:36] and that it was once delivered
[1:08:39] and that we should contend for it
[1:08:43] but who delivered the faith
[1:08:49] once delivered today
[1:08:51] this faith is not given to sinners
[1:08:53] hypocrites making believers or any
[1:08:54] believers only given to say it's fine
[1:08:58] faith this faith is a heavenly product
[1:09:01] that was only delivered to saints
[1:09:04] fine we know it was made but now god had
[1:09:07] to pro fight a delivery van
[1:09:18] to deliver the faith
[1:09:23] oh i wish i was a good preacher
[1:09:29] let's see here
[1:09:31] the prophet says somewhere here he says
[1:09:34] god did it god did it per person don't
[1:09:37] worry god is good time wheels are moving
[1:09:40] just for faith in the order it's it's
[1:09:43] not
[1:09:44] god out of order it's you and i who is
[1:09:46] out of order is what does it and then he
[1:09:48] says as far as i know that's the only
[1:09:50] place in the bible that we are asked to
[1:09:53] contend
[1:09:56] but that was to contend
[1:09:57] for not our faith our faith
[1:10:02] but our faith
[1:10:05] don't contain for our faith that is
[1:10:08] somebody's faith human being's faith
[1:10:11] the faith of those in the number
[1:10:13] particular number special number
[1:10:25] but the faith that was once delivered to
[1:10:27] the saints and the prophet continues to
[1:10:29] say
[1:10:35] therefore the spirit that was in jesus
[1:10:38] was like all the water in the world and
[1:10:40] a gift of the spirit from jesus like a
[1:10:42] spoonful of the same water but the
[1:10:45] chemicals that is in the entire ocean is
[1:10:48] in that spoonful of water it's the same
[1:10:50] chemicals not just much of it we have it
[1:10:52] by major he had it without measure and
[1:10:54] then he says
[1:10:56] of course um genuine faith comes by
[1:10:59] hearing and hearing by the word so
[1:11:02] god
[1:11:04] in his great economy this is now me the
[1:11:06] end of quote keeps spinning the wheels
[1:11:09] of his word he keeps spinning the wheels
[1:11:12] of his word
[1:11:15] for the maturity of faith
[1:11:18] in the blood of believers
[1:11:20] so it becomes the like precious faith
[1:11:27] cut across
[1:11:29] like
[1:11:30] measure
[1:11:31] same
[1:11:32] faith
[1:11:34] same
[1:11:35] measure
[1:11:37] we only have measures when it is our
[1:11:39] level of faith but when it comes to that
[1:11:42] one is same faith because all of us need
[1:11:45] that same faith for the body church
[1:11:48] and then we shall receive the end of
[1:11:51] faith one of these days we shall not
[1:11:52] need faith
[1:11:56] when we go in the rapture we shall not
[1:11:58] need the faith
[1:12:01] we shall receive that's what the bible
[1:12:03] says in hebrews receiving the end of
[1:12:06] your faith
[1:12:10] but when before we that which will
[1:12:12] prepare us to receiving the end of faith
[1:12:15] is that faith which is like precious
[1:12:18] faith
[1:12:19] cut across
[1:12:23] that's what peter says in ii peter
[1:12:25] chapter one verse one
[1:12:27] now let me bring here quickly this
[1:12:30] so he says
[1:12:32] so it had to be this side
[1:12:34] had to be decided with sanctification
[1:12:36] because the church is referred to as
[1:12:38] saints
[1:12:39] the word saint means the sanctified one
[1:12:41] in other words we must contend for the
[1:12:44] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:12:46] sanctified one
[1:12:51] and he
[1:12:52] he puts it in singular not sanctified
[1:12:55] ones
[1:13:00] sanctification means to be called out
[1:13:02] set apart cleansed see cleansed and set
[1:13:04] apart for service
[1:13:06] now he says now the faith that was once
[1:13:09] delivered unto those people that's the
[1:13:11] faith that we are supposed to contend
[1:13:13] for you know what content means is to
[1:13:16] debate or to hold or to contend or
[1:13:19] you know fight for
[1:13:21] now some say well
[1:13:23] they must
[1:13:25] but messages we breathe we say we do you
[1:13:27] have it yes we have got that faith brett
[1:13:29] baptist say the baptist brethren yep the
[1:13:32] catholic says yep the pentecostals say
[1:13:35] yep
[1:13:36] everybody will say yes my church is
[1:13:39] contending for that faith
[1:13:42] that was in the days of the prophet now
[1:13:44] we bring it in our day every message in
[1:13:46] church says we are contending for that
[1:13:48] faith
[1:13:51] because my interest is not so much now
[1:13:53] outside there my interest is you
[1:13:55] that's why i'm here
[1:14:00] now let's go to this something special
[1:14:03] here
[1:14:05] so now let's go back
[1:14:07] in the other part of the scripture the
[1:14:09] army ministry and in the days of the
[1:14:11] saints this is the prophet saying and
[1:14:13] see what kind of faith they had
[1:14:17] and then it is let us contend for what
[1:14:19] they had
[1:14:21] that is the only way to be sure is that
[1:14:23] right and then he says now the first one
[1:14:27] to introduce the faith that the bible
[1:14:30] wants us to contend before was the lord
[1:14:33] jesus christ himself
[1:14:41] so he was goddess deliverer
[1:14:44] fan
[1:14:47] the one who introduced that faith
[1:14:53] john was the foreigner to speak of it
[1:14:55] coming
[1:14:58] but now
[1:14:59] they want to introduce that faith that
[1:15:01] the bible wants us to contend for was
[1:15:03] the lord jesus christ so jesus christ
[1:15:05] introduces that faith
[1:15:09] and then listen
[1:15:12] john was the foreigner to speak of it
[1:15:14] coming but christ was it
[1:15:18] so christ was their faith
[1:15:23] christ was it
[1:15:27] was that faith
[1:15:28] and christ was the introducer
[1:15:31] he was the deliverable and he was the
[1:15:33] deliverer of himself
[1:15:43] that's the faith
[1:15:46] so if you must have the faith who are
[1:15:49] you going to have you are going to have
[1:15:51] christ in you
[1:15:55] not just being a church member very
[1:15:57] thank you very much for being a good
[1:15:59] church member god bless you
[1:16:01] otherwise i would be preaching to you
[1:16:03] cheers here thank you for coming you are
[1:16:06] special
[1:16:08] i must appreciate you for that
[1:16:10] but
[1:16:11] that's not enough
[1:16:17] so part one
[1:16:18] who was the faith jesus christ himself
[1:16:21] who introduced it who was god is
[1:16:24] delivering jesus himself jesus was the
[1:16:27] delivery of one that delivered the faith
[1:16:29] from heaven to us
[1:16:31] to the saints
[1:16:40] the fullness of the word made flesh
[1:16:46] the word was god and the word became
[1:16:49] flesh and dwelt among us
[1:16:52] so the word becomes flesh again that's
[1:16:56] what you contain this for
[1:17:00] oh pastor pray for me i want to have
[1:17:02] faith i want to have more faith my faith
[1:17:04] is too little content for the world to
[1:17:07] become flesh in you
[1:17:13] no one is going to pray for you to have
[1:17:15] more faith
[1:17:18] you are supposed to contend
[1:17:21] you
[1:17:22] not to be prayed for but to content
[1:17:26] struggle fights
[1:17:29] get it
[1:17:31] so if god says content that means he has
[1:17:34] already equipped you with the capability
[1:17:36] to contend
[1:17:38] you are just the one sitting back and
[1:17:41] you think you can't do it pastor i don't
[1:17:43] have faith i don't you don't need to
[1:17:45] have faith you just have to be the
[1:17:47] temple of faith
[1:17:49] when a faith comes and dwells in you
[1:17:51] that's it
[1:17:55] just like paul says me i'm crucified
[1:17:58] with christ nevertheless i live so the
[1:18:01] life now that i'm leaving is not me
[1:18:03] leaving but it's jesus christ who
[1:18:04] reverse enemy glory of god so i'm
[1:18:07] awakening i'm a failure i'm a wretch of
[1:18:10] nothing nevertheless faith live within
[1:18:12] me it's not me who believes it's
[1:18:15] himself who believes is what
[1:18:18] i don't put there my mind i don't put
[1:18:20] there my thinking my thoughts my you
[1:18:24] know my
[1:18:24] desires i have just pulled back i'm dead
[1:18:28] he lives
[1:18:30] content for that
[1:18:38] glory to god
[1:18:40] christ was christ was who christ was the
[1:18:43] faith christ himself he was the one who
[1:18:46] brought the faith listen
[1:18:48] he was the one who brought the faith and
[1:18:50] he was it
[1:18:53] this is the message honestly containing
[1:18:55] for the faith so christ is the one
[1:18:57] himself he was the one who brought the
[1:18:59] faith because christ on earth was god's
[1:19:02] representation to the peoples now listen
[1:19:05] to the peoples on the new deal
[1:19:13] hallelujah
[1:19:15] so there is a new deal man
[1:19:17] [Applause]
[1:19:19] we are candidates for the new deal what
[1:19:22] is the new deal you just stop everything
[1:19:24] you end everything and he comes and
[1:19:27] takes over and it's not you nmo forget
[1:19:30] about yourself just surrender to him let
[1:19:32] him come and live in you and let him do
[1:19:34] what he wants to be done and that's
[1:19:36] god's new deal and that deal will not
[1:19:40] fail
[1:19:40] [Music]
[1:19:42] the other deal of the law lord i know
[1:19:45] the 10 commandments i know
[1:19:47] the laws of the torah i know this i know
[1:19:49] the message i wrote this quote i read
[1:19:52] this one i know this quote the prophet
[1:19:54] said this and then i was back he also
[1:19:56] said it is here
[1:19:58] and then you begin to scratch your head
[1:20:01] i think there is some problem
[1:20:05] because you are now bringing in your
[1:20:06] minds
[1:20:07] [Laughter]
[1:20:10] we are now in a new deal
[1:20:13] the new deal is you stop everything
[1:20:16] you receive the word the word has to
[1:20:18] come and the word has to be very new in
[1:20:20] its fullness and the word is faith of
[1:20:23] itself
[1:20:25] can you imagine when the word believes
[1:20:27] itself
[1:20:29] when the word believes itself and when
[1:20:32] the word manifests itself
[1:20:34] then when the word controls itself and
[1:20:37] when the word in you moves the way it
[1:20:40] wants to move when the word shows its
[1:20:43] glory when the word trusts power and
[1:20:46] then you are sitting there just saying
[1:20:48] amen do it lord hallelujah thank you
[1:20:51] lord thank you jesus it's you now lord
[1:20:55] me i'm a failure continue lord
[1:21:04] glory be to god
[1:21:07] and he says
[1:21:09] oh
[1:21:10] this just this is another message door
[1:21:11] to the heart oh there's just a lot of
[1:21:14] those doors
[1:21:15] let's find the door of faith close these
[1:21:18] other doors
[1:21:19] close these other channels
[1:21:25] then he says he brings in like in a
[1:21:27] quarter form and says now i have faith
[1:21:31] but don't you go to fooling with my
[1:21:34] faith that's what people say
[1:21:36] don't fool with my faith
[1:21:40] there's a lot of people who are going to
[1:21:41] fool with it even yourself can fool with
[1:21:43] it
[1:21:46] you can play a lot of games with your
[1:21:48] own faith
[1:21:53] glory to god
[1:21:54] but he says there is only one faith
[1:21:59] there is only one faith and that is the
[1:22:02] faith of god
[1:22:08] did we read it right
[1:22:12] these others are irrelevant as if they
[1:22:15] don't even exist
[1:22:18] oh i have faith i have
[1:22:21] i know
[1:22:22] you just have nothing
[1:22:26] god doesn't even recognize it heaven
[1:22:27] doesn't even recognize it oh the other
[1:22:30] brother if i can only be like please
[1:22:32] that is nothing
[1:22:36] glory to god there is only one faith
[1:22:39] just like there is only one lord jesus
[1:22:41] christ there is only one faith there is
[1:22:44] only one god one faith one lord one
[1:22:47] baptism glory to god
[1:22:49] [Applause]
[1:22:50] one faith
[1:22:54] that is the faith of god that's right
[1:22:56] and in the message there's another
[1:22:57] message here which is called be not
[1:22:59] afraid is how he says there is only one
[1:23:02] faith and that's the faith of god that's
[1:23:04] right god is faith god is faith you are
[1:23:08] human faith don't go very far
[1:23:14] you watch human faith don't go
[1:23:16] very far

[1:23:51] makes me laugh
[1:23:53] everybody i mean because nobody will do
[1:23:56] me harm
[1:23:58] nobody can now bother me
[1:24:01] so whether you hate me you call me all
[1:24:03] sorts of names
[1:24:05] whether you call me not stupid
[1:24:08] foolish idiots
[1:24:10] i'll just not care because i don't exist

[1:24:23] i'll just love you anybody anyhow i
[1:24:26] don't care
[1:24:27] i'm just the dump the temple of faith it
[1:24:30] doesn't affect my faith
[1:24:32] my faith cannot now be affected
[1:24:36] but it has a lot of effect
[1:24:39] it has a lot of effect
[1:24:41] the faith of god will not be
[1:24:44] stifled
[1:24:47] their unbelief will not impede
[1:24:50] the faith of god
[1:24:52] shall it make the faith of god without
[1:24:54] effect no
[1:24:55] it will keep being effective but their
[1:24:58] unbelief will it affect the faith of god
[1:25:01] no way
[1:25:04] their words
[1:25:06] the amazings
[1:25:09] huh
[1:25:10] oh you call him a messiah whatever it is
[1:25:13] you know whatever go away don't prophesy
[1:25:16] here don't preach here this don't bring
[1:25:17] this here don't mention this here no
[1:25:19] problem
[1:25:22] no problem
[1:25:24] makes no problem no no it doesn't matter
[1:25:25] to me
[1:25:26] i just it makes you love everybody makes
[1:25:29] you laugh makes me love everybody
[1:25:31] everybody and the prophet says that's
[1:25:33] right that's what god is god's faith
[1:25:36] does to you
[1:25:37] makes you have the same feeling
[1:25:40] that jesus did oh
[1:25:43] same feeling
[1:25:47] some feeling that jesus did because the
[1:25:49] spirit of christ is new
[1:25:52] and now i want to bring you something
[1:25:54] which is a shocker here the prophet says
[1:25:56] here
[1:25:57] i think in the message where i think
[1:25:59] pentecost fame he says when you receive
[1:26:01] the holy ghost
[1:26:03] everything you have got need of between
[1:26:06] here and glory is right in you then
[1:26:10] when you receive the bible you know the
[1:26:11] holy spirit everything that you have
[1:26:13] need of between here
[1:26:16] name it now count it
[1:26:20] what do you need
[1:26:22] can you mention ionic
[1:26:26] everything that you have need of as long
[1:26:27] as you receive the holy spirit so it's
[1:26:29] very important
[1:26:31] to know whether you have him in you
[1:26:35] oh i'm the bride i'm the bride okay what
[1:26:36] proves where's the husband
[1:26:43] you are not the bride until the
[1:26:45] bridegroom has come
[1:26:48] and until you have united with him
[1:26:52] so don't take it presumptuous sin
[1:26:57] you must be sure
[1:27:00] so when you receive the holy ghost
[1:27:02] everything you have enough between now
[1:27:04] between here and glory is right in you
[1:27:07] then it ain't the faith that you need
[1:27:13] when you have
[1:27:14] the holy spirit in you you don't need
[1:27:17] the faith
[1:27:24] i'm reading your prophet
[1:27:26] it is the faith that you need
[1:27:30] you've already got faith
[1:27:35] because faith is the person of the holy
[1:27:38] spirit
[1:27:39] so when you receive the holy spirit when
[1:27:41] you receive christ in you you have
[1:27:43] already got
[1:27:44] faith so you don't need faith how do you
[1:27:48] need water of god
[1:27:50] [Applause]
[1:27:52] does it make sense in your english
[1:27:58] you've already got something and you
[1:27:59] need it
[1:28:01] no
[1:28:05] you've got faith
[1:28:07] you've got the holy spirit
[1:28:08] now he for he is your faith
[1:28:13] the holy spirit
[1:28:14] in you the person of christ in you is
[1:28:17] your faith
[1:28:19] now he said where your problem is
[1:28:22] but the thing you have to know
[1:28:25] is to know how to use that faith
[1:28:33] how to use
[1:28:37] just like you have any machine you
[1:28:40] bought it it's good but have you already
[1:28:42] this manual
[1:28:49] you misused it it will trouble you
[1:28:58] you can cut off your finger and you
[1:28:59] throw it off
[1:29:01] you can curse it yet you got it
[1:29:04] you are the one who bought it
[1:29:07] you have it
[1:29:09] but you should know how to use it
[1:29:13] that's why every device comes with a
[1:29:15] menu
[1:29:17] and they will always tell you
[1:29:19] before you use this thing
[1:29:24] please please read this manual carefully
[1:29:29] make sure you understand how it operates
[1:29:35] that's where we have a problem
[1:29:39] how to use
[1:29:41] faith
[1:29:47] how many believe here they have the holy
[1:29:48] spirit
[1:29:50] so when you have the holy spirit you
[1:29:51] have got faith
[1:29:54] you don't need faith
[1:29:57] faith is laying down and they are
[1:29:59] getting arrested doing nothing
[1:30:02] it's always crying out
[1:30:05] you know wanting to get into some action
[1:30:07] it's dormant and you are there oh i wish
[1:30:10] i got faith
[1:30:14] and god is looking at you say what what
[1:30:16] do you want me to do for you
[1:30:27] you when you have the holy ghost when
[1:30:28] you have the personal impression you've
[1:30:30] got your faith he is your faith but the
[1:30:32] thing that you have to know is how to
[1:30:33] use that faith see what i mean
[1:30:36] and if you'll just understand how to use
[1:30:39] it
[1:30:42] now the prophet says which we will try
[1:30:44] to this coming week to explain it
[1:30:47] you will see the exceedingly
[1:30:51] abundantly above all that you could ask
[1:30:55] or think for the lord to do that means
[1:30:57] you
[1:30:58] get the things things will begin to just
[1:31:01] work out and say so all along i had this
[1:31:07] like the third pool
[1:31:09] like when brother branham created this
[1:31:11] creature squirrels you thought he knew
[1:31:13] he has power to create he did
[1:31:16] but when god says
[1:31:19] do you want squirrels yes yes how many
[1:31:21] three speak
[1:31:25] and i say well the first one should be
[1:31:29] there before he could finish pointing
[1:31:31] the thing was there and then he rubbed
[1:31:33] his why did he rub his eyes
[1:31:39] the creator was already with him
[1:31:43] but he didn't know how to use
[1:31:48] and when
[1:31:49] to use
[1:31:53] god didn't come like with a pump and
[1:31:55] begin pumping him
[1:31:58] now i'm giving you the power to create
[1:32:02] oh you go and fast some three days
[1:32:08] the creator was already there the word
[1:32:12] think of brethren the word that sparkled
[1:32:14] the universe into existence all the
[1:32:16] stars
[1:32:17] the word that created every animal every
[1:32:19] bird every flower every fish everything
[1:32:22] the word
[1:32:23] is
[1:32:26] but you are scared you are you are
[1:32:28] failing to put it into use
[1:32:35] that you want some someone to push you
[1:32:37] into it rather and then maybe pray for
[1:32:39] you and shake it a bit and you feel hey
[1:32:41] i was shaking the preacher prayed until
[1:32:43] my body vibrated now i believe i think
[1:32:46] i'll be healed
[1:32:53] you have it in you
[1:32:59] you have it in your friend
[1:33:03] but just to use it
[1:33:05] that's the problem that's what you have
[1:33:07] to pray for
[1:33:08] content for that
[1:33:11] the operation
[1:33:13] guidelines
[1:33:16] of their faith that's in me
[1:33:18] [Music]
[1:33:20] but their faith is already there
[1:33:22] brother you don't need faith
[1:33:24] you got it
[1:33:26] i i i think one time i mentioned the
[1:33:28] hair statement i said peter costas who
[1:33:30] don't even believe baptism in jesus name
[1:33:32] can you pray for the sick they can pray
[1:33:34] for the lame and they walk
[1:33:36] in other words in essence they are not
[1:33:38] even saved
[1:33:39] he that believes and these baptists
[1:33:41] shall be saved but their baptism is in
[1:33:44] error
[1:33:45] so the unsaved they can pray for the
[1:33:47] lamb and they walk
[1:33:51] because
[1:33:53] they have faith
[1:33:55] what about me who is faith
[1:33:59] for them they have some measure of faith
[1:34:16] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:34:18] that is part a
[1:34:20] i'm now done with the party
[1:34:25] let me go to part b
[1:34:32] this faith
[1:34:34] special faith was delivered to the
[1:34:36] saints but when it was delivered to the
[1:34:38] saints
[1:34:39] listen once
[1:34:41] goods are delivered
[1:34:46] there has to be some offloaders
[1:34:56] eh
[1:34:58] do you know jesus said it on the purpose
[1:35:00] go you make the world of disciples for
[1:35:02] me and baptizing them in the name of the
[1:35:04] father and of the son and the holy
[1:35:05] spirit that was a package that was a
[1:35:08] writing an inscription on a box
[1:35:15] so when you are going to the shop to buy
[1:35:17] you don't buy a whole box
[1:35:20] they are those people who offload a
[1:35:22] nanny pack
[1:35:25] and get the item that you need
[1:35:30] and that's the 5 40 ministry
[1:35:39] and that's why the devil is fighting two
[1:35:41] areas
[1:35:42] he's fighting faith in the world
[1:35:45] and they fight for the ministry
[1:35:50] some of these things are in the bible
[1:35:52] they are in the message you all have
[1:35:53] message books you all have the bible but
[1:35:56] you cannot pick them out
[1:35:58] there are riddles until a gift from five
[1:36:02] four minutes to fix it out
[1:36:04] and makes it plain and makes it clear
[1:36:14] and when you got to a shop you got
[1:36:16] different you know what you call what
[1:36:19] like supermarkets you call them what is
[1:36:22] the way you call them
[1:36:25] in america they say where you call it so
[1:36:26] you go to this you go to that you go to
[1:36:28] that you go to different places and buy
[1:36:30] different things and you gather them in
[1:36:32] your house and you call them my property
[1:36:36] but they never came from one shop and
[1:36:38] not one day
[1:36:41] you went to the campaign you bought a
[1:36:42] bed you bought this you bought a
[1:36:44] cupboard you bought this yes that is a
[1:36:47] carpenter
[1:36:50] then you went to the other shop you
[1:36:52] bought a mattress you bought pillows you
[1:36:54] bought bedsheets you bought a blanket
[1:36:55] you bought that
[1:36:57] so this has to unite with this
[1:37:01] to make a bed
[1:37:04] but you never bought them from one shop
[1:37:09] but then eventually it will be a
[1:37:11] complete house
[1:37:13] and it will be your property
[1:37:16] then you went to another shop you bought
[1:37:18] you know you you bought spoons and you
[1:37:21] know these and plates and cookers and
[1:37:24] what and all those things and
[1:37:25] kitchenware and all the table etiquette
[1:37:28] all the requirements you put it there
[1:37:31] then there's where you go to buy food
[1:37:34] that is where you buy spices
[1:37:41] but the things when they are coming from
[1:37:43] the factory they don't come
[1:37:46] in the
[1:37:47] volume that you buy them
[1:37:52] they are delivered
[1:37:55] to those big places
[1:37:57] and then the workers
[1:38:00] and parker them
[1:38:02] offroad and honey park
[1:38:11] and then they display
[1:38:14] for the buyer to come and buy
[1:38:18] now you have come to bcf shop
[1:38:25] and the holy spirit is displaying
[1:38:27] some goodies for you to buy today
[1:38:35] when brother chad is preaching he has
[1:38:37] also his own maybe
[1:38:39] for him he has also he displays
[1:38:41] something else a little bit different
[1:38:43] for me another one will come and display
[1:38:45] something else and you keep buying
[1:38:48] and the bible say buy and never sell it
[1:38:51] you can buy you keep buying big buy and
[1:38:54] it becomes u.s
[1:38:56] [Applause]
[1:38:58] until it becomes a complete home
[1:39:01] complete house
[1:39:05] five-fold ministry
[1:39:09] that's why this the faith in the word
[1:39:12] or the faith of jesus christ and the
[1:39:15] five-fold ministry are under attack
[1:39:19] i was asking one brother i said well
[1:39:22] i have no problem with listening to tips
[1:39:24] i listen to tips
[1:39:26] the church should listen to the tips of
[1:39:28] the prophet read the books of the
[1:39:29] prophet but i mean you cannot tell me to
[1:39:31] sit down
[1:39:33] not preaching
[1:39:35] where would you have got these people
[1:39:38] whom you want just to sit down to listen
[1:39:40] to a trap
[1:39:41] if god didn't use a man to unpack
[1:39:46] the boxes from the message and preach
[1:39:49] them even in the local language which
[1:39:51] they don't understand english
[1:39:59] why are you interested in putting down
[1:40:01] the foreign foreign ministry
[1:40:03] brother branham was not against the 540
[1:40:05] minister
[1:40:10] the faith was delivered okay
[1:40:13] it's delivered to the shops fine who is
[1:40:15] going to any park
[1:40:18] who is going to display
[1:40:20] who is going to make it easier
[1:40:22] for a person to peak
[1:40:27] in one sermon god makes sure there are
[1:40:29] so many things there someone says to me
[1:40:32] i go to this the other one said to me i
[1:40:33] got this they don't send me i got this
[1:40:35] god spoke to me this god also spoke to
[1:40:37] me this oh god they answered my prayer
[1:40:39] oh i came with the question me i was
[1:40:41] sick i was healed me i had a problem in
[1:40:43] marriage right there are many things in
[1:40:46] there someone but it's the displaying
[1:40:48] capability of the holy spirit through a
[1:40:51] gift
[1:41:00] so he gave some to the apostles
[1:41:03] are prophets teachers vangris you know
[1:41:07] and then
[1:41:08] what for
[1:41:10] to bring the unit off
[1:41:18] so the unit of faith
[1:41:21] is gathering the pieces of the horror
[1:41:24] that was preached by the five-fold
[1:41:26] ministry
[1:41:28] and the whole world well i mean the
[1:41:30] whole world comes upon itself

[1:45:10] classical leftovers in you

[1:45:57] does it
[1:45:58] you you can't do it you can't do it
[1:46:01] yourself now you are no match for him
[1:46:03] you are no match for the devil you are
[1:46:05] no match for the enemy
[1:46:07] but if you just let god do it get the
[1:46:09] word in you that's how to let god do it
[1:46:11] get the word in you then it will be
[1:46:13] taken care all of it
[1:46:15] to take care of all of it
[1:46:18] then he continues and he says
[1:46:20] this is the part i want you not to miss
[1:46:22] i'm finishing don't get tired
[1:46:26] now god fortified his army
[1:46:30] with the what
[1:46:33] with himself
[1:46:37] in the form of what
[1:46:40] listen carefully you'll say well god
[1:46:43] fortified us with the word
[1:46:46] no but how did that word come
[1:46:48] let me go back god fortified his ma his
[1:46:51] army with what with himself in form of
[1:46:54] prophets
[1:46:57] apostles
[1:46:58] teachers
[1:47:00] pastors
[1:47:07] what did he do
[1:47:08] what was god doing listen
[1:47:10] did you ever think
[1:47:12] what that officers of the church is
[1:47:17] it is goddess dress
[1:47:22] it's god is addressed
[1:47:24] inside the dress
[1:47:27] not even this outward
[1:47:29] inside
[1:47:35] inside the dress of god
[1:47:39] them offices
[1:47:43] so whoever touches the true genuine 5-4
[1:47:46] ministry is touching god is inside the
[1:47:48] dress
[1:47:54] you can play with my shirt
[1:47:56] but don't play with my inside dress
[1:48:00] yeah you can pray with my trouser yes
[1:48:03] even when the other woman attacked he
[1:48:05] touched the helm of the garment of jesus
[1:48:07] not the inside one
[1:48:21] did you ever think of what that offices
[1:48:23] of the church is it's goddess dress
[1:48:25] inside address and that is an apostle a
[1:48:28] prophet a seer farsi before saturn ever
[1:48:31] gets it is danny told now today's
[1:48:34] preacher is also a prophet
[1:48:36] now he comes and says what is it
[1:48:38] god dressed up in his church
[1:48:41] and then he says this offices
[1:48:44] is goddess blessed aware
[1:48:48] when you see those offices pastors
[1:48:51] teachers evangelists what is it
[1:48:53] that's goddess dress where
[1:48:56] god is princess god is spirit god
[1:48:59] working through man
[1:49:03] god working through man
[1:49:07] to establish himself in the believer
[1:49:16] so you tamper with the genuine office
[1:49:20] begin to point fingers out and be little
[1:49:24] whom does pass past the chad think he's
[1:49:28] just bossing over us and thinking is
[1:49:36] as long as he's bringing you the word
[1:49:39] not himself
[1:49:42] okay what do you think is his interest
[1:49:49] i mean do you think we are here because
[1:49:51] we want money
[1:49:52] i think i would be a better businessman
[1:49:54] outside there if i was to devote this
[1:49:56] time to making money
[1:50:00] do you know the pain we go through
[1:50:03] some of you people the faces you are
[1:50:05] looking at us when we are preaching
[1:50:11] the demons the spirits in you how they
[1:50:13] make you react
[1:50:15] how some of them throw out time frames
[1:50:21] we think that is a job to enjoy
[1:50:25] thinking that you are sitting there
[1:50:27] my friend brother chad and you are going
[1:50:30] to answer for all these souls
[1:50:32] you think it's a joke
[1:50:39] it's not a joke
[1:50:42] and friends
[1:50:43] can you please allow this many do their
[1:50:46] work
[1:50:50] can you please say amen when they are
[1:50:52] doing it
[1:50:56] that's what i was telling you yesterday
[1:50:58] why are you why are you unhappy
[1:51:01] are you supporting the devil that i'm
[1:51:03] working on you
[1:51:05] are you annoyed
[1:51:10] oh you should be happy
[1:51:12] that more of the word is coming in you
[1:51:15] more of him today move him again until
[1:51:18] one day the fullness of him will be
[1:51:21] formed in you the unit
[1:51:24] of faith the unity of faith bringing the
[1:51:26] unity of faith
[1:51:30] all the unity of faith bringing the full
[1:51:32] unit of faith in you and then we go home
[1:51:42] but the moment you begin to doubt a
[1:51:44] ministry or fight or resist a ministry
[1:51:48] that is bringing the word in you
[1:51:52] you are unstripping god is inside where
[1:51:59] that's what the prophet says that is god
[1:52:01] is inside the dress
[1:52:04] you know all of us have got some fast
[1:52:06] clothing we put on
[1:52:08] you know how delicate it is
[1:52:10] how no man no man can tamper with that
[1:52:12] one
[1:52:20] and that's why the devil around the
[1:52:22] world has risen against genuine
[1:52:26] word holders
[1:52:28] those who are holding the king's sword
[1:52:33] he doesn't want them
[1:52:36] and i think you should not join the
[1:52:37] chorus
[1:52:39] of fighting them or resisting them
[1:52:46] because the whole purpose is when the
[1:52:49] fullness of the word of god that was an
[1:52:51] impact is packed in you
[1:52:54] by the 540 minister until the fullness
[1:52:56] of that person is in you that is the
[1:52:58] full faith
[1:53:01] complete faith
[1:53:04] and the devil doesn't want that to be
[1:53:06] achieved
[1:53:08] that's why you'll make you sleep he
[1:53:10] can't even make you fall or sick in the
[1:53:12] morning when you are coming and if you
[1:53:13] are spiritually sensitive you say why is
[1:53:16] the devil making me throw up now
[1:53:19] i slept very nice well
[1:53:22] now when i'm trying to dress to go to
[1:53:24] church i feel headache stomach up said
[1:53:27] this is the devil
[1:53:30] i'd rather go and follow sick in the
[1:53:32] church
[1:53:34] there must be something there today the
[1:53:36] devil doesn't want me to take that one
[1:53:40] and if you persist and come you'll
[1:53:42] believe me you will not even see that
[1:53:44] sickness
[1:53:49] you know
[1:53:50] when the dynamics the omega dynamics
[1:53:53] baby died you remember that tsunami to
[1:53:55] manis baby
[1:53:56] when she died when the baby died and you
[1:53:59] know what killed it
[1:54:00] disease of the head my head and it was
[1:54:02] the harvest time
[1:54:05] and many of them are dying of headaches
[1:54:07] today
[1:54:08] heavy high-minded proud arrogant
[1:54:12] interesting
[1:54:13] stiff-necked
[1:54:16] my head my head my head that's what
[1:54:19] killed them so this human puts the baby
[1:54:22] on the bed of the prophet and he brings
[1:54:24] to look for the prophet and what does
[1:54:26] the prophet do when the prophet comes
[1:54:28] he puts his nose on the nose of the baby
[1:54:32] bounced mouth ear ear
[1:54:34] covers and
[1:54:36] you know shakes himself over talk about
[1:54:39] desperation
[1:54:40] so what was he doing
[1:54:42] he bible says he laid over the body
[1:54:45] until the baby became warm
[1:54:50] and when i meet with you you know
[1:54:53] i mean when i meet
[1:54:55] my eye right i will meet with your left
[1:54:58] eye
[1:54:59] left hand with a right hand and it's
[1:55:01] like negative connecting to the positive
[1:55:04] and then the charging is going on and
[1:55:06] there was nothing interrupting that
[1:55:09] brooding
[1:55:10] until the baby got home until the life
[1:55:13] came back but you know when you come to
[1:55:15] church when the devil knows there is
[1:55:17] something now that's meant for you when
[1:55:20] you the holy spirit is brooding over you
[1:55:22] and the word is coming and you are
[1:55:23] starting to feel warm the devil said
[1:55:25] please god the show the washroom grass
[1:55:30] and then something from nowhere boils
[1:55:32] you and then
[1:55:37] the devil doesn't want you to get warm
[1:55:40] in the presence of the holy spirit
[1:55:42] that's why sometimes to make babies cry
[1:55:45] and you don't know why it's crying
[1:55:49] you go out it keeps quiet you come in he
[1:55:51] just cry the devil uses those stupid
[1:55:53] sometimes
[1:55:57] and then you go there and you are visa
[1:55:59] kissing your baby
[1:56:01] [Music]
[1:56:03] and you don't know that maybe the devil
[1:56:05] is wanting you to miss something
[1:56:08] pray against these demons that are
[1:56:10] failing you because these are the final
[1:56:13] touches since season
[1:56:15] final touches god is doing final touches
[1:56:18] on us we are about to go home
[1:56:21] so every time that you come in the house
[1:56:24] of god matters is very important
[1:56:28] and make sure any preacher whether he's
[1:56:30] just
[1:56:31] madly to fix a not
[1:56:33] maybe pastor abraham is just a nut fixer
[1:56:40] there are those who pick put big places
[1:56:43] look like fixing an engine and
[1:56:45] i'm not that one so i can come here just
[1:56:48] fixing that
[1:56:49] but without that nut the car is not
[1:56:52] complete
[1:56:56] and the inspector will come and he
[1:56:58] speaks well the snap is not fixed
[1:57:01] so but when the car was rolled to the
[1:57:03] point of the night fixer
[1:57:07] this time the car
[1:57:09] is you you can roll yourself beyond the
[1:57:11] net fixer before the nut fixer has fixed
[1:57:14] it
[1:57:20] so now
[1:57:22] we are coming to this time of the faith
[1:57:25] that overcomes the world we must
[1:57:28] overcome
[1:57:30] and it's going to be the faith of the
[1:57:33] lord jesus christ himself the faith of
[1:57:36] god
[1:57:38] not your faith
[1:57:40] not your mind
[1:57:42] not a faith not comparing you yourself
[1:57:44] at least i'm better than sister
[1:57:47] daniella
[1:57:56] well i think i treat my wife better than
[1:57:58] brother
[1:58:00] so and so treats his
[1:58:03] stop that nonsense
[1:58:08] you just say
[1:58:09] how do jesus treat her
[1:58:14] because i must become him
[1:58:16] that's my measure
[1:58:18] how would jesus
[1:58:20] treat her
[1:58:24] okay your wife you say okay now how
[1:58:26] would i treat jesus because jesus is in
[1:58:29] him and jesus is in me
[1:58:32] so how would i treat jesus
[1:58:34] in this person
[1:58:37] how would i respect him if jesus came in
[1:58:39] the form of this brother if jesus came
[1:58:41] to me in the form of this sister how
[1:58:43] would i receive him
[1:58:47] back to the garden of eden man who's
[1:58:49] both male and female
[1:58:54] on the one hand you're the bride on the
[1:58:56] other hand you're the bride group the
[1:58:58] bridegroom in you is the bridegroom for
[1:59:00] the other one and then the bridegroom in
[1:59:03] the other one is your bridegroom
[1:59:05] and you are the bride and the other
[1:59:06] bridegroom
[1:59:07] she's also the bride for this bridegroom
[1:59:10] and talk about fellowship
[1:59:12] talk about love
[1:59:14] talk about devotion
[1:59:16] talk about unity
[1:59:19] talk about
[1:59:20] respect
[1:59:22] submission to one another preferring one
[1:59:25] another
[1:59:26] supporting one another being there for
[1:59:29] one another that's the revelation
[1:59:32] that's the point
[1:59:34] it comes by the faith of jesus christ
[1:59:36] not the faith of bcf
[1:59:39] not the faith of brother so and so
[1:59:41] sisters of my faith i know my heart i
[1:59:45] know my faith stop quit that
[1:59:48] takes you nowhere
[1:59:51] let that faith graduate
[1:59:54] let it come to the level it wants to
[1:59:56] supposed to be
[2:00:00] from peace means of faith to the
[2:00:02] fullness of the reality of faith the
[2:00:05] faith of god himself
[2:00:08] and i'm not going to be afraid
[2:00:10] you are not going to be afraid
[2:00:13] no one will say but what about the other
[2:00:15] sister will she make it
[2:00:18] what about the other brother
[2:00:20] she's in trouble i mean we need to read
[2:00:22] to stand i mean this is oh brother
[2:00:24] greater in me i'm very weak you know i
[2:00:26] can't
[2:00:27] it's not any weakness that you're
[2:00:30] talking about anymore
[2:00:32] forget about that
[2:00:33] if it is weakness all of us are going to
[2:00:35] be weak but if it's strength then all of
[2:00:38] us have the same nature of strength
[2:00:41] and the bible says he is even
[2:00:44] going to support the weak of those ones
[2:00:47] weak
[2:00:49] for the poor is even for those who are
[2:00:51] weak in what
[2:00:52] the prophet is saying
[2:00:54] that means it's going to
[2:00:56] lift you up to this river
[2:01:00] amen
[2:01:01] because when you are moving in a bus
[2:01:03] it doesn't mean the other one who islam
[2:01:06] cannot walk we'll always remain under
[2:01:08] the bus as the bus goes
[2:01:10] somebody will lift that person up
[2:01:15] and and bring in the other person to
[2:01:16] also sit here
[2:01:18] and the weak and the upper body will all
[2:01:21] be in the same level
[2:01:23] as we go
[2:01:26] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:01:28] so let's be careful let's fight anything
[2:01:33] that is not the word
[2:01:35] that's why the devil is fighting the
[2:01:38] word he's fighting the message and he's
[2:01:40] fighting the five-fold ministry and
[2:01:42] anybody who is trying to stand with the
[2:01:44] truth is singled out
[2:01:48] fought for that because the devil knows
[2:01:50] the mystery
[2:01:54] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:01:57] so
[2:01:58] let's open up to mr perfect like i
[2:02:02] preached on friday who
[2:02:04] what went you out to see in the
[2:02:06] wilderness
[2:02:07] you went to see mr perfect you knew
[2:02:09] william branham no
[2:02:12] that is not the man
[2:02:15] it is the man he introduced
[2:02:17] that's what we went to
[2:02:19] whom would you go and go to see educator
[2:02:22] the genius most powerful man in the
[2:02:24] world no
[2:02:26] not that kind of change
[2:02:29] he wasn't anything
[2:02:31] but he introduced us to the masterpiece
[2:02:34] mr perfect mister everything the hell
[2:02:37] shall die
[2:02:38] [Applause]
[2:02:40] and he's here with us
[2:02:42] and he is to be in you
[2:02:44] and he's to guide you all away and i'm
[2:02:47] not going to bother about whether you
[2:02:49] make it or not
[2:02:51] because you as long as it's in you
[2:02:54] you've already made it
