[0:00] he has Sanctified Us by his Spirit he
[0:04] has filled us he's burnt out the worldly
[0:06] Nature by the Holy Ghost he's come to
[0:08] take residence in US amen so that we
[0:12] will stay consecrated to him amen not
[0:15] because we have to
[0:19] but because we want to
[0:25] I I grew up and oh I grew up in all
[0:29] kinds of preaching friends
[0:31] and youth meetings and all kinds of
[0:33] gatherings I hit the altar every time
[0:36] the events have started naming bad
[0:37] things in your life
[0:41] because it was there
[0:44] what other choice did I have
[0:47] but it was this Revelation that was
[0:50] contained in the seals
[0:52] that that unsealed who I am
[0:57] there was the Revelation under the seals
[0:59] that unsealed who I am
[1:01] I knew God was holy but I didn't realize
[1:05] that I was supposed to be holy
[1:08] I I knew he was holy but I didn't
[1:11] realize he
[1:13] he because he wanted to be he wanted me
[1:15] to be the Tabernacle that was going to
[1:18] be Tabernacle deity in this day
[1:21] and when I come to realize what God
[1:24] wanted to do in this generation that he
[1:27] wanted the deity to be tabernacled and
[1:29] flashed and that he wanted my flesh to
[1:31] be part of that Tabernacle all of a
[1:34] sudden everything in my life changed it
[1:36] wasn't anymore I have to be a good boy
[1:38] to make it to Heaven I realize I've
[1:40] already made it I made it before the
[1:42] foundation of the world when he placed
[1:43] my name on The Book of Life amen before
[1:46] it was there I was in his thoughts I was
[1:48] always with God and always a part of God
[1:51] I'm not in jeopardy of being lost I'm
[1:53] not conducting myself in a way to be
[1:55] saved I recognize I'm saved I'm
[1:58] conducting myself in a way to keep
[2:00] myself in his purpose
[2:02] [Music]
[2:03] because I recognize his purpose in my
[2:06] life I won't join in in the things of
[2:08] the world not because I'm going to be
[2:10] punished not because lightning bolts are
[2:12] going to hit me or because the rest of
[2:14] the church will reject me I I know what
[2:16] he wants me to do and now that's what
[2:18] I'm consecrating myself for I know who I
[2:22] am I know my purpose in life I know the
[2:24] light that's supposed to shine from this
[2:25] vessel now I sanctify myself for their
[2:28] sakes amen because they're not going to
[2:30] find him in a system they're not going
[2:31] to find him in Hollywood they're not
[2:33] going to find him in pleasures of the
[2:35] world where will they find him he'll
[2:36] find him in the word that's coming forth
[2:39] from his bride she's the final voice and
[2:41] the final age how can I now live an
[2:44] unconsecrated life where somebody won't
[2:46] hear the voice of God
[2:50] you understand going behind the veil
[2:52] changes everything
[2:54] entering the little room amen having him
[2:57] unveil himself to you it changes
[2:59] everything
