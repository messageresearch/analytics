[0:00] All he's told is to cast this rod before
[0:02] Pharaoh's assign. He's not told anything
[0:04] else. And when he throws this rod down,
[0:07] it turns into a serpent just like God
[0:08] had showed him before in the wilderness.
[0:11] But the part that Moses wasn't told by
[0:14] God is that there'll be other power that
[0:16] can copy and mimic that power.
[0:19] And the magicians came and threw down
[0:21] their rods and it turned into
[0:23] serpents. And just imagine for a minute
[0:26] you're
[0:28] Moses and you're thinking this is
[0:30] exactly why I didn't want to come
[0:37] because he there's nothing he can
[0:40] do. He is powerless. He is incapable. He
[0:44] is unable.
[0:48] God never told Moses to do anything
[0:50] else. He just told Moses to drop the the
[0:53] the the rod and it'll become a serpent.
[0:56] And he did exactly what God says. And
[0:58] listen, uh when when the other
[1:02] magicians threw down their rods and they
[1:05] become serpents too, Moses was at a
[1:08] complete loss as what to do. Brother Ram
[1:11] tells us so. He said Moses just stepped
[1:13] back and watched. There was nothing he
[1:15] can do. He was completely inable,
[1:17] incapable, had no understanding. He was
[1:20] at the end of his intelligence and his
[1:21] ability. There was nothing he can do.
[1:24] And and and Moses doesn't start saying,
[1:26] "Okay, that was just a joke. I was just
[1:32] because Moses is in partnership with
[1:34] God." Don't forget what a partnership
[1:37] is.
[1:39] A partnership is not I do
[1:41] everything, you do nothing, we split the
[1:45] proceeds 50/50. You do everything. No. A
[1:48] partnership is you have your part to do
[1:50] and I have my part to do. Moses did his
[1:53] part. And when it went beyond Moses's
[1:56] ability, there was nothing else for
[1:58] Moses to do but sit still and be quiet
[2:01] and let his partner work.
[2:05] That's exactly what Moses did. Moses
[2:08] realized, I'm on partnership with God.
[2:09] And now we've be we've gone beyond my
[2:12] part of the contract.
[2:15] Because I'm here for the natural part.
[2:18] I'm not here for the supernatural part.
[2:21] Listen you, brother Chad. Listen, that's
[2:24] still the truth, friends. You can't make
[2:25] anything supernatural happen of
[2:27] yourself.
[2:28] It takes God. Amen. There's so many
[2:31] things that God wants us to do. Hey,
[2:33] listen. You can put your clothes on and
[2:35] you can come to church on time and you
[2:36] can pray and you can worship and you can
[2:38] hear the word. You can open your Bible
[2:40] and read. You can listen to the message.
[2:42] You can There's a lot you can do. You
[2:44] can testify. You can share the word.
[2:46] There's a lot you can do. But hey,
[2:47] there's just as much you cannot do.
[2:51] I'll tell you what else. Listen, God
[2:53] can't read the Bible for you.
[2:58] You have to read it.
[3:00] God can't come to church for you. You've
[3:02] got to get in the car and you've got to
[3:04] push on the pedal and you've got to
[3:06] come.
[3:08] Amen. You say, it's not as though, you
[3:11] know, we we decide to miss a few ser, we
[3:12] get tired and we want to sit home and we
[3:15] don't want to come and whatever. For
[3:16] whatever reason, we decide. Listen, God
[3:19] doesn't just pick you up and carry you
[3:21] and teleport you in and sit you here
[3:22] because there's something you need to
[3:23] hear. No, there's a part you have to do.
[3:27] And if you're going to get the benefit
[3:28] out of what God told us is benefit,
[3:30] you've got to do your part to get the
[3:32] benefit that he promised you would get.
[3:33] Right.
