speak your words of eternal life for God I yield to you and surrender to you and may you come on the scene may you take Lord this word and may you break the bread of life to us your waiting children and may we receive it Lord with eagerness Lord and may it come into us and change us we ask it Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you while we're standing if we we could open our Bibles and turn to Exodus together Exodus 12 I also uh wanted to mention I I I was going to mention it Sunday and I forgot I failed to but um I just wanted to mention the um I I give thanks to all those who come out for the Saturday evening prayer time I know there's several of you who are very very consistent in coming out there's others who come as they're able but uh it's always really nice to see Saints in here Saturday evening and if you didn't know that the churches open Saturday from 3:00 p.m. till 10 p.m. for prayer just an open prayer time you come pray anywhere and here you like uh stay as long as you like and come and go freely between 3: and 10 and uh it's always encouraging but this this Saturday especially this has happened many times but this Saturday I came in and I've been studying all day I've had the day set aside I've been in preparation and meditation and I come down and as I come come down that center aisle I usually come down and and pray right here in front uh right as I lock up I lock the doors and uh as soon as I was walking down the aisle the presence of the Lord just became more and more powerful and as I knelt down some things that I was locked up on I couldn't get the inspiration were all sudden opened up and the inspiration started to flow and I wanted to share that with you because we had a tremendous service on Sunday and I there's a lot of factors that go into that a lot of moving Parts a lot of particip ation in the body and I know there's a lot of you who are praying through the week and trusting in the Lord and asking special prayer for myself whoever will be ministering and and setting the atmosphere in here on Saturday it all works together for the glory of God and I want to say thank you and God bless you and if you haven't had the opportunity to Avail yourself of that opportunity I'd recommend it I know many people are busy and there's things happening and you may not always be able to come but if you find yourself with an opening on Saturday between 3:00 and 10: it would do your a world of good good and it would do us a world of good as well I love the atmosphere that prayer creates amen I know many of you pray at home and that's wonderful but there is something special about praying in the same place it does create an atmosphere amen so God bless you while we're standing let's read Exodus 12 verse 13 together and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt am mean Lord bless you as you have your seats we've been uh we've been talking about the new birth and the token and just many different things and and as it happens so often sometimes I feel like a broken record when I begin to talk cuz I say the same things cu the same things happen to me over and over again I I I have a plan I have an idea I think we're going to go one way and then the Lord interrupts that plan which I know is a good thing amen it's a wonderful thing but when you're the one who's constantly getting jerking back and forth it's not so easy amen that's the way we want it and we don't want it ever to change but you know when it came uh to the service on Sunday I I never even come close to completing my thought I barely touched where I what was on my heart and the things I prepared so I thought I'll just come tonight and finish it well when I come to preparation over the last two days something else injected itself and now I've got to do that before I get to the next part and we'll see if we ever get there amen amen we just trust the Lord and I love the way he leads amen so we're going to we're just going to go that way but tonight I'd like to do a little bit more teaching and I'd like to take for a a subject the title entitled to the Token entitled to the token and we just want to we want to share some things concerning that let's turn together to the Book of Joshua we know in Exodus 12 we were dealing with the Exodus and when Moses was given the instructions by God to instruct Israel and how to take a lamb how to put the lamb up how to slay the lamb and take the blood and how to apply the blood and he promised that if they would do as Moses commanded and apply the blood then then when he smokee the land of Egypt he would pass over the death angel would pass and the plague would not fall that's the scripture that we read and now we're going to come to Joshua chapter two we're going to pick up the story of the two spies in Rahab in Joshua 2:12 now therefore I pray you swear unto me by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token so now Rahab is asking them hey I've I've I've I've hid you I've helped you I've aided you and these were the two Messengers that were sent in Amen to spy out the land they were sent from Joshua from the presence of Joshua to come in and and and she said give me a true token and let's drop down to verse 17 and the men said unto her we will be blameless of this thine oath which thou has made us swear behold when we come into the land Thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou this let us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy Brethren and all thy father's household home unto thee and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of this house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be Guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him so now uh we know that brother REM tells us that in the Exodus Journey the blood was the token it was the token or the evidence or the representation that a substitutionary life had been given amen for the household amen and they were in the house feasting on the lamb amen that had slain and and but on the outside of the house house was a token evidence that a lamb had been slain in obedience to the word of God to fulfill God's requirement and when he saw the token amen he would pass by amen so that was a token now we find Rahab the Harlot she's in in Jericho and Jericho is destined to be destroyed and she asks for a true token amen not just any token but she wants a true token and The Messengers gave her a true token this Scarlet thread that you've let us down by amen hang this out your window amen and your house will not be destroyed and all that are under the Scarlet thread all that be are safely in the house that's behind the Scarlet thread they will be safe also so we find here this is uh some of the scriptures that brother Brenham uses when he preaches the message the token he starts showing us what our token is and he begins to break it down and show us that our token he says we had a lamb also that was slain for the household of God it was the Lamb of God it was Jesus Christ the son of God Amen the flesh body of God and and that that blood that flowed through his veins was the blood of God Amen and that blood was shed for us to pay the price of redemption so that we could go free amen but he teaches us in the the the token message that that blood went down into the Judean soil and and that that actual physical blood that was shed out that vein the veins was the blood of God but it it went back into the Earth and it went back into content and back into to things like that and we cannot get that physical literal blood now for an application but we can get an application by faith in that blood when we believe by faith that that blood was shed on my behalf that that sub substitutionary offering was a substitution for me we can say he was subst substituting for the sins of the world that's not enough Faith amen we got to have faith to appropriate that for us personally that's the faith that'll bring Redemption so now we we see then that the blood is shed and we can we can get an application of that blood by faith amen but then there has to be a token of the blood amen a token that a substitutionary life was given on our behalf and that token now is not the chemistry of the blood like it was in The Exodus Journey amen but that token now is the very life of Jesus Christ the very Holy Ghost life that comes back upon us as a Believer amen and that is the token amen that that that God has honored our faith our faith in what our faith in Calvary our faith in Salvation our faith in Redemption amen God has honored our faith and sent down his token as a seal and that token is the evidence that there's been a substitutionary life given for me without the token there's no evidence amen there's no evidence that your faith has been accepted accepted when Abraham's Faith was accepted he was given a token a seal of circumcision and that seal of circumcision was a token evidence that Abraham's Faith was accepted amen we have faith but our faith must be accepted the acceptance of our faith is the token the life of Jesus Christ and our life Amen brother B says in the token message but when I see the token I'll pass over you it's God's requirement of the hour amen yeah it's God's requirement of the hour brother said he could not preach the token message till after he preached the seals amen amen because now he's coming and he's preaching the full life of God is now come back into the church no longer a dip in the Holy Ghost like in the church age is no longer a partial amen because where there was partial word there was partial life amen but now that the fullness of the word has come and through opening of the seals the fullness of the word brings the fullness of the life amen and that life now comes into the Bride of Jesus Christ into the church and now it's token time amen it was a lamb before but now it's token time now it's time for the full life amen and that full life wasn't just to come into the house but the token life must be on display on the outside of the house the token must be on display we must receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the the life of Jesus Christ coming into us to Quicken the seed that's in us and to seal us amen into the day of redemption it's a recognition of our faith amen but that we can have that experience and say I've had that experience but if we have that experience the token must be on display it must be on the outside of the house and this is our house and on the outside of the house it shows that the lamb is on the inside and they're feasting on the lamb which is the word amen and while they were feasting on the word they were told to eat the whole lamb not no not just the tasty Parts eat the pertinence thereof eat it all consume the entire thing and he said if you can't consume it then let it be burned don't let it hang over to another day amen and that was symbolic of the church ages brother B comes along and tells us that in the church age you couldn't have a carryover from one day to the next it all had to be consumed but hey praise God we're in the end time there is no carryover there is no other day there's no part of this lamb that's not to be consumed but we're here to consume the whole word all of Christ the fullness of the Lamb is being consumed in the house amen and outside of the house is the life of the Lamb we're consuming on the outside as token evidence the life's inside amen glory and it wasn't just the death angel that recognized the token brother R said everybody that walked by recognize the token and he applied the same thing to you and I the people we come in contact with the people that see us walk down the street the people we work with the people we go to school with the people we live with they should see there's a life on the outside they should see something is different about us than about when than the rest of the world that's right cuz the token must be on display so brother B I'll read this again so but when when I see the token I'll pass over you it's God's requirement for the hour the evening time message is to apply the token there's so many things in the message we talk about the message is so encompassing it's so deep it's so broad it's the full revelation of the word it's the it's Jesus Christ The Mystery of God revealed it's the full word unveiled it's so encompassing but sometimes brother Brenham makes these simple statements and tells us what the message is and in the end time at the last days the evening time message is to apply the token what's it all coming down to it all comes down to the life must be on display amen the token must be on the outside of our house for all the passer Byers to see the life of the Lamb must be on display amen that's the evening time message you can see why the token had to be preached at the end of the church ages because they could not live the full life of Jesus Christ because they did not have the full Revelation in Luther's day they understood justification but they had no understanding of sanctification and if justification without San sanctification it doesn't mean Luther was lost and it doesn't mean Luther didn't have the Holy Ghost amen amen but because he didn't understand amen he didn't understand sanctification the word had not opened up that far to the elect seed of God he would still be a man who would drink a man who would smoke a man who would swear amen he would still be a man although a child of God although has the Holy Ghost but it couldn't be token time yet because he couldn't have the full measure of Christ on display this is the only time it could be token time at the end of the church ages after the opening of the seals when the Life of Christ when the veil has been taken off when the denominational confusion has been eliminated and we see Christ for who he is and now we're here not to just see Christ but we're here to reflect Christ and brother V said you reflect what you're pointed at you're pointed towards a denomination you reflect a denomination but you're pointed to the full or of the full brightness of the Sun in our day you're going to reflect the full brightness of the full orb of the sun that's what the word in our day has done amen so the token must be on display amen let's go to Acts chapter 2 Acts chapter 2 verse 37 and when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said to Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do this is on the day of Pentecost after Peter begins to preach then Peter said unto them repent and and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for this promises unto you and to your children to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this unor generation untorn means crooked or perverted from this unto generation then they then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day they were added unto them about 3,000 Souls amen so they asked the question their their hearts were pricked by the preaching of the word they said what shall we do and he tells them to repent and as we've been studying repent means to change your mind to have a change of mind repent means your actual understanding will change amen and when that changes everything else changes and we know that that that repentance I mean we we talked about repentance is not asking forgiveness cuz asking forgiveness and repentance aren't the same thing asking forgiveness is asking for a pardon or a release for something you've done wrong amen all right but repentance is changing the way you think about the offense right because if there's no repentance you can ask forgiveness but guess what next week you'll ask forgiveness because you'll do the same thing and next week you ask forgiveness because your thinking your mind your understanding hasn't changed about the offense so you keep repeating the offense but repentance will bring a change of mind and you won't keep repeating the same offense because your whole understanding about it will change so they had to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus for the remission of sins and they would receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and he begins to tell him this promises to you to your children to all that are far off that includes us even as many as the Lord our shall God shall call so if God's calling it's still available I love love when the prophet says that over and over if God's still calling This Promise is still in effect so then he he admonishes him with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourself so so when he begins to talk to them he he's preaching to them the message of the hour they're asking what they need to be do and he's telling them but he's also saying save yourself from this unto generation I don't think this was a mild thing I think he was calling out to them Flee for the Wrath that is to come amen amen and they that heard him gladly they received his word and were baptized and then they were added to the church about 3,000 Souls brother Bram says in the message desperations which is the message he preached in the evening after he preached token he preached the token in the morning and in the evening message he preached desperations and in desperation says we know it's true that God will meet a desperate Soul now we all know that but it usually takes something to drive us into that to that despair to the desperation it takes something to do it and then he goes a little further and he says further down in the message he says when you pray for the baptism of the Holy Spirit the token don't say well now I'll go up and try Lord I'm a little tired oh mercy stay in your seat don't even make an attempt we can see on the day of Pentecost this wasn't a light thing and if the message that Peter preached was not a light message it was a heavy message and he was was talking about what they had just done in rejecting the Messiah and how he he he was slain he was taken by Wicked hands and and he was slain and then he raised again and how the Fulfillment of Prophecy was there and it was a heavy message and they were pricked in their heart they wanted to know what they needed to do to be saved and he gave them instructions and then he was admonishing them save yourself from this generation amen I think they went into desperation amen because they moved immediately amen they didn't say give us a day to think about it we'll come back and hear you next Sunday but immediately they heard him amen they received his words they were baptized in jesus' name and they were added to the church 3,000 Souls amen when it comes to the uh baptism of the Holy Ghost it's not something to say well if I get it I get it amen that's not the approach if that's the attitude you're not ready yet for it amen you're not ready there's got to be something you says that I have to have this because it's this or perish amen it's this or be lost it's this or not go in the Rapture it's this or nothing for me it's all or nothing amen I've got to have the baptism of Holy Ghost I've got to be sealed till the day of redemption I have to have that life in me amen there needs to be a desperation there needs to be an Earnest seeking amen amen and and there must be an Earnest seeking according to the word let's turn to Acts chapter 5 now I want to I'm Moving in now to the the title entitled to the Token because brother B says something interesting and I I want to look at it and and I pray that the Lord will help us understand what he's saying in Acts 5:32 Peter says in verse 32 and we are his Witnesses of these things and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God ha given to them that obey him I want you to hold on to that language so the Holy Ghost is he says we Are Witnesses so also is the Holy Ghost whom God ha given to them that obey him amen man there's no doubt that those 3,000 that were baptized that day received the Holy Ghost because they obeyed the word of the Lord amen they repented and were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of their sins they were told they shall receive but he says the Holy Ghost has given to them that obey him brother brandham he picks this up and he understands this language and in the token I've been reading in the token for a while now and as I read in it I become amazed sometimes at things I see and he says in the token paragraph 338 the token is the sign that the purchase has been made and been accepted now you can't get the token from the railroad Fair until you pay the price and the only way you're going to pay the price is pay it that's right what believe it accept it full obedience to the whole word of God will entitle you to the Token amen oh I want to I want to focus on this for a minute amen we can we can uh we can have many misunderstandings it's easy to have misunderstandings we have our own ideas we have our own human intellect and we have religious backgrounds and it can bring so much misunderstanding but but Brothers Brenham is telling us when you get the token from the railroad fair and he's talking about the railroad you pay money and get a token and you don't give money on the railroad you give a token the token is the evidence that the price was paid your token is evidence that somebody paid the price it nothing necessarily mean you paid it somebody else could have paid it and gave you a token but the token is the evidence the price is paid amen and when you want to ride the railroad you must give them the token and the token is exchanged for the ride on the railroad amen now in order to to to to bypass tribulation in order to be sealed into the day of redemption in order to be born again we must have a token amen for the death angel to pass we must have a token amen and this token is the life of Jesus Christ but but he's he's using this explanation get the token from the railroad Fair until you pay the price you can't get it till you pay the only way you're going to pay the price is pay it that's right what believe it accept it full obedience to the whole word of God will entitle you to the Token amen now you see why uh you can see why you can oh I don't know how I don't know the best way to explain it but you can put so much pressure on people to do so many things to try to get the token or the baptism of the Holy Ghost through so many different kinds of demonstrations or signs and this and that amen and and and you make the effort you make the we we can make the effort to get it the reason for receiving it but Peter says repent have a total change of mind amen amen and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen so sometimes we make the the effort to get the Holy Ghost the means by which we get it but the prophet of God is telling us that we just need to believe it and accept it amen and full obedience to the whole word of God will entitle you to the Token yeah amen so if I want the token what do I need to do I must surrender to the full word of God in full obedience to the full word of God cuz the Holy Ghost is a witness of God whom he giveth to them that obey him so there's a promise in the word that he gives the Holy Ghost to those that obey him and he says full obedience to the whole word of God what's the whole word of God well I'll tell you friends the whole word of God is the message of the hour right where else will you get it how else will you find it everything else has been tainted by denomination been misunderstood by Creeds and dogmas and teaching of man amen but the message of the hour has I took the veil off of the Bible and now the seals are taken off of the book of redemption and now we can see it as it was intended to be and this is the whole word of God Amen but without the message of the hour the word is still sealed so how will you believe it how will you accept it how will you obey it without the message amen coming and opening back up the word and now we can enter into the word amen and receive the token amen amen I believe it's simpler amen than we make it many times sir I mean it's simple but not simplistic it's simple but it's hard amen it's not complicated full surrender an absolute dying to self and accepting all of Christ amen and by faith believing all the word will entitle us to the token but oh friends it's hard to die it's easy to say it's hard to die it's an easy concept it's not a difficult thing but when it comes down to the action many many times we find that we we just we we have a hard time with the surrender part but I I want to read this to you again so that you can lock in on it amen because it's so important he said that that's right believe it accept it full obedience to the whole word of God will entitle you to the Token full obedience not the part of it as far as your denomination goes but all of it amen amen full obedience to the word which is Christ brings you into Christ now what if you was just all in but your feet hanging out what if you was all in with your hands hanging out most all of us in but the heart hanging out see your heart is in the world yet but we don't do that full complete obedience puts you in the word as one you you believe it every bit all of it's in you and you watch it work through you amen amen now you can see listen I I I I I I I want to make this a un an an understanding according to what the prophet brought and I don't want to complicate it or make it complex but really this message is Christ amen it is the word it is the revelation of God Amen it is the Mysteries revealed it is Christ amen and when we come into Christ with a full surrendered to Christ and all that was brought to us through that messenger amen if we can fully surrender to that and die to whatever previous idea whatever emotional hangup we have or whatever little thing that's still hanging on but if we can die to all of that and surrender to this message amen we can be entitled to the Token because the Holy Ghost is given to them that obey amen amen see he says again just a couple paragraphs later now watch fully now full obedience to the whole word of God entitles us to the Token I want to say if we come to the altar but we still have things that we want to keep we still have relationships we want to hold on to we still have habits we're not ready to turn loose of yet we still have pleasures of this world that we're not ready to surrender we can cry and weep and cry and weep but until we're ready to make a full surrender until there's a total repentance and our mind changes and we want nothing to do with anything else and all we want is this word until we come to that place amen we're going to be going through motions and we're going to get into an emotional workout but at the end of the day it's not going to accomplish anything because the Prelude to this amen is repentance yeah amen and repentance is a change of mind amen and so I wonder so many times we see we've seen so many people baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so many have taken true baptism according to the word but not received the gift of the Holy Ghost but it's a promise but the promise is if you repent amen repent and are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you shall that promise cannot fail that's right so if we're baptized correctly in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen we must look at our repentance amen did I completely repent have I died to my own thinking have I given up all relationships and all attachments and all of my rights amen and if I have and I've taken his name in baptism Then This Promise will take effect in my life amen it's not questionable friends it has to it's the word of of God amen amen in the message doors and doors the prophet said it's a little thing that we leave undone sometimes that breaks the whole chain you see and lets us go free let's denominational minded just denominational minded and forget about those little things that really are the essential things everything every word of God is essential none of it can be left out amen we've got to take every word of it just the way it was wrote I love that Amen in God's only provided place of worship he says every little jot everything you must be faithful in it always the little Vine the little fox that spoils the vine sometimes it's not the big things you do it's the little things you leave undone remember a chain is only strongest at its weakest length blessed are they that do all the Commandments of God that they might have right to enter in do all God said and it said for women to have long hair you say a man told me not long ago said I Don't Preach clothline religion I said then you're not preaching the gospel God laid it out there he said what to do and and you either that's your natural reasonable thing what little thing the little insignificant Jesus said blessed are they that would take all the little things do the little things and a woman to let her hair grow that why it's just a something she can do and she won't even do that she won't even do that oh teach us the great things how can you teach the great things when you don't do the simple common thing because you see your motive and your objective is wrong why because you still have self mixed in why wouldn't you do it that's always the question to me I mean if the prophet of God teaches it why wouldn't we do it that's right that's right why so often when the prophet of God teaches something we try to explain it away or make it a matter of opinion or or this and these were the circumstances and I don't think and why would we do that friends when we've got a Vindicated prophet of God on the scene that has brought us the mysteries from the back part of God's mind amen why would we disrespect the gift of God like that just to take our own opinion amen see our motive and our objective is wrong many times see it's your love to God Lord I don't care what you want me to do I'm willing to do it then you're getting somewhere but if you don't do it that way the way he said do it then he didn't finish the sentence see it's your love to God and I love the S Lord I don't care what you want me to do I'm willing to do it I want that to be my attitude to where I'm not the central theme of my whole life anymore and my opinion isn't the greatest thing that I value amen I don't want to value my opinion I want to Value this word amen and when my opinion comes in contrast with the message of the hour I'm going to dump my opinion and take the message because that's what's been Vindicated by God Amen my opinion doesn't have Vindication I don't have a pillar of fire over my opinion amen but this message has been backed up by God we can trust itall in John chapter 14 let's turn there in John Chapter 14 verse 15 Jesus says in John 14:15 if you love me keep my Commandments amen Paul said one time if anyone's a prophet or spiritual among you let them acknowledge that the words that I speak unto you they are the words of the Lord amen amen so in order to keep the word of the Lord they had to keep what Paul said that's right and Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments right F he says in verse 16 and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever I love the way I love the way the Bible is written because it's always a challenge in the word it's so challenging if you love me keep my Commandments and I will it almost seems like one is dependent on the other amen like if you love me and keep my Commandments and then I will pray to the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever and it's not exactly like that so don't don't get nervous on me but it's just a there's amazing challenges here in the scriptures and I want to read another one down in verse 22 Judas saith unto him not a scariot lord how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world Jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come into him and make our Abode with him what's he talking about he's talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so he says if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him it it it almost looks like that the Father's Love is deter DET mined on our love but we know other scriptures that say otherwise we love him because he first loved us so it's not that God's waiting to see if we'll love him or not we know that God already knows and we love him because he first loved us and chose us before the foundation of the world if we ever love him it's only a reciprocating love it didn't originate in us it's reciprocating back to him but he's laying out a pattern and I don't want to miss the pattern and I also don't want to misunderstand the pattern if a man love me he will keep my my words well I love him but how do I love him because he first loved me by predestination so that kind of man that loves me is the same kind that'll keep my words by predestination and my father will love him and we will come into him and make our Abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine but the Father which sent me see how see how brother benam can so easily grab a some statements out of the Bible and say full obedience to the full word of God will entitle you to the Token he taking it right from the scriptures amen right from what Jesus said there in the Book of John and right from what Peter said in acts in Acts chapter 5 amen and it becomes an absolute truth full obedience to the full word of God what brings you to full obedience to the full word of God true repentance a true repentance will bring you to full obedience to the full word word of God because your mind will change about everything else and you'll understand that this is the way to walk in amen and then we our love will be expressed our by our obedience and God promised that they will make our Abode he'll make his Abode with us he said in the message the token don't you rely upon no speaking in tongues no nothing else but let the token itself be there the person of Jesus Christ his own life in you circumcise not just this and that but circumcise your whole being till you and Christ are one Christ in you and his life lives out through you amen Christ is the word he is the manifested word yes amen so I want to die out till me and this word that's been delivered are one amen so I want to just take a look and this is where I want to take a little bit of time in just a few minutes and I want to look at something in Balance here because there's always two things that are presented in the Bible and I want to keep them straight it looks as though we can say if we take the statement full obedience to the full word of God entitles you to the Token if we take that with a legalistic mindset we can think all I have to do is XYZ a b c if I do all of this then I automatically have it amen if I don't do this I don't get it it can and it can appear that way but it's not by legalism it's by love amen and it's still a reality no matter how we feel about it it's still the truth amen am Amen brother Brenham said I've always tried to keep a balance of the road you get away off inform formalism just as formal and ritualistic as you can be people grab for that lot then if you don't watch you'll get Plum off on the other side and be just as fanatic as you can be but there's a middle of the road where the TRU sounds gospel is preached and God moves in there vindicating the truth straight is the gate Narrows the way but few there be that find it he says again in another message the one the Oneness run off on jesus' name the Trinity went off on Father Son and Holy Ghost just like they did at 19 Council same thing they both was wrong but now in the middle of the road in the scriptures lays the truth now he's going to bring it down to the subject at hand he says You must be born again so not trying to squeeze in calvinistic belief now I'm not I'm saying this now that I'm talking to a legalist people he's speaking to Pentecostal people which were more of the Armenian Doctrine the great battle between calvinistic and noridian Doctrine if I could sum it up in 30 seconds it's way more complex than this but Calvin believed in absolute predestination amen and and and the extreme Calvinism not necessarily as Calvin taught but Extreme Calvinism got to the point where there's no need for evangelism there's no need for this or that you're going to be saved regardless of you you were predestinated and you don't do anything about it you don't even have to H H pray a prayer of repentance right you're just absolutely predestined saved the Armenian says no you've got to make a choice and God has given man free moral agency and you've got to choose and you've got a right to choose you can choose to be saved or you can choose to be lost and brother renom grabbed from both of these and brought us the truth amen amen now somebody who really knows calvinist doct in Armenian they're going to crucify me for that but that that's a super duper condensed version he said that's not it that's not it at all because I'm a legalist too that's what brother bam said but I believe this that Calvin had something and so did Armenian have something and they both had something but they run off on the Deep ends of it the calvinist said well I'm saved and that just settles it his life proves that he isn't then he isn't saved he thought he was saved because he was predestinated he agreed with the scriptures but he had no change in his life and his life continued on as it was and he says his life proved that he wasn't yeah and the legalist says I've got to do this and I must do this and I must do that then if you're not born again you're still not saved so there you are so you can do all the do and you can don't all the don'ts but if you if you're not born again you're still not saved he says it's in between in the middle of the road is where we've got to stay amen what are you what calv what Calvinism is what Grace is is what God did for you but what works is is what you do for God in appreciation of what he did for you through Grace that's the whole answer am then if I'm saved then I live like I'm saved but listen to way says but I could live like I was saved and not be saved praise be to God so it's the fact that brings it to this spot that we must be born again so the Born Again experience tells us what we are it doesn't mean I believe in shouting and all the manifestations and demonstrations of the spirit but yet that's not it yet it's something different from that it's a new creature something in the heart amen so brother R's able to pull from two doctrines and bring them together and he he's doing this all the time he's pulling from Oneness and trinitarianism pull from Calvinism and Armenian ISM and he's all the time pulling it together and showing us the balance in the scriptures amen yeah and so the the reality is the word is true if you love me you'll keep my Commandments and if you do my father will come unto you and we'll make her abod in you that's absolutely the truth amen but not because you were able to keep an ordinance but because you loved him you kept his Commandments and you loved him because he predestinated you and loved you first and if he didn't love you first you couldn't love him and if you didn't love him you couldn't keep his Commandments it's not keeping the Commandments without love and it's not love without keeping the Commandments but you put the two together and you got the right picture according to the scripture and that's why full OB obedience to the whole word of God will entitle you to the Token amen not a legalistic keeping of message standards but an absolute love and revelation of what this message is that causes you to want to die to yourself and want nothing else but this word amen and when you surrender that way because you love it because you love this message because you love everything about it because you love what Jesus Christ has done for you in this day and that what he's given to you and you value it more than the breath that you breathe amen and when you surrender to that full obedience to the full word of God with that kind of love will entitle you to the Token that's right because why that comes from a true repentance amen amen I want to show two more examples of the same thought just as we move on it's amazing how in every group of Believers every church we have some who lean one way and some who lean the other it's true I'm going to say it and you all know it and you'll get pictures in your mind but don't blurt out names you have some who are a little more strict and they a little more firm and they they know the guidelines and they see the guidelines and and they want to stay with the guidelines right and I'm not calling them wrong that's just the way they lean you have others who lean towards Grace and they're a little more flexible and they give a little more grace and say you know what God looks at the heart anyways he's is not looking at all these things you can do all those things and still be wrong right and then the other ones over here saying you know what you can say you love God all you want but if you won't surrender and sacrifice for him do you really love him if you won't do what he says is that love the other ones are saying you can do everything he says but that still doesn't mean you love him and in every in every group we got some that leave one way the other praise God because that keeps us together in balance we need that thing we you'll see brother brandom he'll come and preach this subject all the way over on this other side amen it's all predestination and you didn't have anything to do with it and it's going to happen regardless and blah blah blah then he comes over here and says you better accept him now you better get down to this altar amen so I thank God Amen that we have a diversity here that'll keep us Balan amen when you're when you're walking on the tight RPP amen you never see that Long Rod that they got amen we'll just call that the word of God Amen because I need something to keep me going because it's so easy for me myself to get me off we need we need that balance of the word of God because you can take the word of God and you can go either direction and the message broken sisters he says he's telling a story about a man that he led to the Lord he said he was talking to them out in the old barn stall One Day by a manger and he said but I'm no good I he said I know you're not said I'm not either but I said you're looking at what you are and quit looking at what you are and look at what he is he said if I could just get rid of these cigarettes brother brandham I'd be a Christian I said don't get rid of them you're trying to get good and then come to him he never came to save good men he came to save bad men that know they were bad amen he said well I said listen you don't want to go to hell do you he said no I said well why don't you do it uh you don't I said you you don't have to he died that you might not have to go he said what do I have to do I said I said nothing it's just that simple he said but if I could ever I said there you go back to the cigarettes again quit thinking about that cigarette just remember think about him what he did what he is not what you are you're no good and you never was and you never will be but what he is he's the one and I said now the only one thing you have to do if he took your place down there you just willingly accept what he did only thing you have to do is just accept it why he said that's simple I'll do that I said here's that the creek said I brought him up there and I baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ some of his people are sitting here I know they felt funny at me for doing that but I knowed what I was doing I seen in the man something that was genuine I could see it there and I took him and baptized him in in the name of the Lord Jesus and when we did that it wasn't long after that till I was went down to his son's house we seen a vision of a tree being broke at a certain place and the man fell almost broke his back took him to the hospital and that night the Lord revealed to me that that was the end of the cigarettes the next day he wanted some cigarettes I said I'll buy him a carton and take it to him you just watch and see his cigarette days are done he never smoked one since and never wanted one sense amen I love that what a beautiful picture amen now let's read the next quote marriage of the Lamb 1962 and that we know that there is going to be a bride and there's going to be a wedding supper served in the skies that's just as sure to be as God is because it's the word and we know that those that are going to make up that bride is going to be his church and they're going to appear before him without spot or wrinkle and they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready if you notice she has made herself ready so many says if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or gambling or from lying or stealing I'll serve him but that's up to you see you got to do something too yes amen they that overcome Shalla herit all things they that overcome you have the power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down and she has made herself ready I like that word you see God could not push us through a little pipe pull us out the other end and then saying blessed is he that overcometh you have nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself I have to make decisions for myself in doing that we show our faith and respects to God so he told the man don't worry about the cigarettes don't worry about it the next one he says you've got to lay that down yourself you've got to make your own decision you're asking God to take it away so you serve him but you've got to make your decision good oh I love the message it won't let us amen go one way or go the other amen it has we have to be honest when we read the message because it has to keep bringing us back to the middle and the re the reality is if you can lay it down if you've got a hold of something and can turn it loose you've got to turn it Loos yeah amen but if something's got a hold of you and you can't turn it loose you need a supernatural deliverance from almighty God God the reality is they are both true amen amen sometimes we we want God to make it easy for us cuz we want no struggle God take away the desire take away the Temptation take away all of this and I'll serve your lord and I'll I'll do all this but no you've got to fight your way through it you've got to lay it down you've got to resist the flesh you've got to fight against the devil if you can lay it down and you can resist it then you lay it down and you resist it but when something's got a hold of you not you got a hold of something but something's got a hold of you and you hate it and you LOE it and you want to be free amen just trust God and move forward God will deliver you from that righten they're both true amen they can both be true at the exact same time amen I mean we have an obligation to live a clean life we have an obligation to live for God we have an obligation to make decisions to match his word we have an obligation to lay everything down that's contrary to his word and follow his word we're obligated to do that but When Something's Got a Hold On Us and we can't lay it down we can't give it up and we can't get free that doesn't stop us from serving the lord that doesn't stop us from moving forward but we've got to be honest with God and say God I got to have a Deliverance of this I can't serve you like this I can't go on like this and I can't get rid of it myself and then trust God for the part that we can't do amen you see how they're both true y one will take the lazy way if God wants me to be free he'll make me free when God takes us no friends you can see in this first story that man was genuine he didn't want to smoke he was trapped he wanted to give his heart to the Lord he wanted to serve God but he was going to wait till he get rid cigarettes and he had no way to get rid of him on his own amen so brother Brenham gave him good advice and told him just trust in Christ and look to him and not to yourself amen the next story he talking about somebody spiritually lazy who just wants God to do all the work and make life simple with no struggle and no strife he says no you've got to be an overcomer and you've got to have something to overcome yourself and God's not just going to pull you through a pipe and pull you out the other side and say you overcome you overcame nothing you've got to make your decision you've got to lay it down you've got to choose to serve God I love it is it this or is it that won't we just bring it together and get the right picture amen let's go to Acts 26 book of of Acts chapter 26 I'm going to grab another verse here as we wind down Acts chapter 26 verse 19 this is the Apostle Paul in Acts Acts 26: 19 whereon king of grippa I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision but showed first unto them of Damascus and at Jerusalem and throughout all the coast of Judea and then to the Gentiles that they should repent and turn to God and do the works meet for repentance I love this teaching of the Apostle Paul he said he was going everywhere teaching that they should repent and turn to God that's the first thing that he began to preach and that's what Peter began to preach and that's the gospel message repent and turn repent and be converted that word turn is the same that's translated converted elsewhere repent change your mind and be converted be turned back but then he says and do Works meet for repentance here the Apostle Paul doesn't leave it just repent and be converted but he says do Works meat for repentance this word meat the word the word works is just works or deeds we simply know that but the word meat it means to have the weight of another things of like value worth as much or corresponding to a thing so we should bring forth Works corresponding to repentance or with worth as much as our repentance or as weighty or of like value as our repentance and that's why so many times our works actually declare our level of repentance it's a it's a ratio and that's what he's saying bring forth Works meat are in same value or corresponding to repentance the change of mind and this explains so many things that we see all around us sometimes because you see sometimes people living in a in a in a compromised life and they're and they're in Disobedience and continual Disobedience and you wonder why and you realize their mind really hasn't been made up for the message amen they might be going along they might be sympathetic but there's not a real true absolute knowing that this is absolutely nothing but the truth am and you find works that are meat for that level of repentance yeah and sometimes you scratch your head and you wonder how can they continue to to choose this and how can they continue to go that and then you realize there's not been an absolute change in understanding they're not really understanding what the message is the message is not a better teaching the message is not a clearer understanding all of those are included in the message but amen this message is none other than Jesus Christ completely unveiled amen me if we take it if we take the prophet of God as as as another church age messenger who just brought a reform and he's another preacher who's a little bit better than the other preacher amen we got to realize this isn't just a good preacher these aren't just good sermons amen this this is the seventh angel amen this is the one in Revelation 10:7 this is the Elijah of Malachi 4 amen when when when when Jesus says of the Apostle uh uh of John or not not the Apostle when he says of John the Baptist he was more than a prophet you can take the same thing right to the prophet in our day he was more than a prophet amen he was a prophet to bring the Covenant amen he was a fulfillment of Revelation 10:7 it was more than just a prophet it was more than just a church age messenger amen but you can see the level of works sometimes matches the level of repentance true when we see brother brandom as a good man and and and he's a messenger and and but but you know he thought this and he did this and you know the Bible says this and he said that oh my goodness we're playing in dangerous games right now because we're belittling the very voice that God used in this day amen the voice of God came through that man's vocal CS to give us the true interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication and when we start playing around with that it starts to show exactly where our repentance was we're not so sure we understand what this message is or who this messenger is right and the works are meat to the repentance praise God say God wash my understanding amen give me a true understanding of what you've done in this day amen make it a reality to me so I know beyond a shadow of a doubt what day I live in and what you've done in this day amen praise God amen let's go to Genesis 22 Genesis 22 and10 in Genesis 22: 10 it says and Abraham stretched forth for his hand and took the knife to slay his son the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I and he said lay not thy hand upon the lad neither do anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God saying thou has not withheld thy son thine only son from me amen question is did God not know that he feared him before the angel of the Lord called on says now I know that thou fearest God but surely he already knew what was in Abraham's heart but still Abraham needed to act out his faith and when Abraham acted upon his faith amen the angel stayed his hand and the angel of the Lord said now I know that thou fearest God I don't think that was a new revelation I think it was a declaration amen that you have proved your faith amen amen you have proved and Vindicated what you believe and works as Faith expressed the prophet says now the two men that were talking on faith Paul Justified Abraham by what God saw in Abraham but James Justified Abraham by what man saw in Abraham see now James said he justified by his Works Paul said he's justified by faith but see Abraham believed God that's what God saw in him he believed it but then when he went into action as though it was already done that's what man saw in him and that's the same thing as it is to us because our works Express what faith we have remember bring forth Works meet for repentance amen our works Express what faith we have but if we're afraid to act on what we believe then we do not believe it see you've got to believe it amen let's go to Romans let's just I want to read a couple scriptures here as we we finish up but I'm going to read Romans and we're going to read in James Romans chapter 4 first Romans chapter 4 verse 1 what shall we say then that Abraham our father as pertaineth to the flesh hath found for If Abraham were justified by works Heath weof to Glory but not before God for what saith the scriptures Abraham believed God and it was counted on him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness so Paul's very clearly saying it's not by works but it's by faith and by faith it was count to him for righteousness now hold your hand here and turn with me to the Book of James remember the word cannot contradict itself amen amen James chapter 2 verse 14 what doth it profit my brethren though a man say ye hath faith and have not works can Faith save him if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be you warmed and filled notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body what doth do it Propet even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone now listen Paul just said it was faith without works now it looks like James is saying something different notice as it looks like the Bible cannot contradict itself amen so even so verse 17 again if if it hath not works or faith if hath not works is dead being alone yay a man may say thou Hast faith and I have Works show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my Works thou believest that there is one God thou doest well the Devils also believe in tremble but wilt thou now oh vain man that wil uh but wilt thou know oh vain man that faith without works is dead was not Abraham Our Father justified by works wait a second what did Paul say he was justified by faith was not Abraham Our Father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar seest thou how Faith wrought with his works and by works was Faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God you see then how that by works a man is Justified and not by faith only oh I love this this is what makes some people's heads spin amen but you realize when you put the two of these things together like brother Benham said brother Benham said works is the testimony before man man saw the works and they saw Abraham's faith God looked at Abraham's faith and he recognized it works is what man says but but also amen faith is our love to God and works proves our love to God and and James is not James is not contradicting Paul and Paul's not contradicting James but what Paul is saying is you can say that you believe all you want you say you believe in one God so do the devils and they tremble so what amen if it doesn't produce works in your life you don't really believe it that's what James is saying what you believe becomes your life amen what that's why you bring forth Works meat for repentance because what you believe comes into manifest estation and becomes part of your life and that's why he says amen uh uh Works wrought with uh Abraham's faith and Abraham's Faith by works was made perfect what does it mean perfect completed it was fully manifested what was in his heart came on display and the angel of the Lord said now I know that thou fear God because it was a complete perfect Faith because it'd come into manifestation now that doesn't mean now now I told you to hold your place so let's go back Romans chapter 4 so what is the Apostle Paul talking about because it looks like he's saying Works without works it doesn't require works if it was by works it would be by debt it's by faith alone that's what it looks like he's saying and and it is what he's saying but if you go to the previous chapter chapter 3 just before chapter 4 before he says all of this in chapter 3 look at verse 19 now we know that the things soever the law saith that say to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God therefore by the Deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his side for by the law is the knowledge of sin we could go all the way down but let me just let me just cut down here to uh verse 26 to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus where is boasting then it is a excluded by what law of Works nay but by the law of Faith therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the Deeds of the law when he's talking about works in the next chapter what's he talking about he's talking about the Old Testament law right he's not saying that you're not supposed to do the word of go keep the word of God and do the works that God has called us to that's not the point he's talking about the law you can never be saved by keeping the law all the works you want to do does not make God indebted to you he doesn't have to save you just because you kept the law the law was here to prove that you couldn't do it it was here to condemn you not to save you amen therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the Deeds of the law is is he the god of the Jews only is he not also of the Gentiles yes of the Gentiles also so then he comes over to chapter 4 and he starts saying amen what shall we then say Abraham our fathers pertaineth to Faith hath found for If Abraham were justified by works he ha where of to Glory but not before God for what sayith the scriptures Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness you know that that James quotes this exact same thing so they're believing the exact same thing they're just coming at it from two different angles amen Paul is showing the the the the Jews and they're showing that you don't have to carry this over into the New Testament into the Gentiles you can keep the law you want that doesn't obligate God or put God in debt to you God is recognizing your faith and by faith he's imputing to you righteousness James is coming and saying you can tell me you believe all you want but if there is no Works coming from your faith your faith is dead and it's in vain amen both are true amen amen let's go back to James go to James chapter 1 verse 22 says but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetthe was but who so lookth unto the perfect law of Liberty and continue therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed I said I don't want to be a hearer only brother bam said in the message perseverance he said in the whole armor of God is Faith love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness patience the whole armor of the believer is faith we believe God by faith because God said so then what is it Abraham was justified by Paul by faith but by James by works Abraham was talking what God saw James was talking what man saw show me your faith by your Works without your works and so forth then if you don't have works with your faith it shows you haven't got faith you're just talking from your mouth I love the prophet if you don't have works with your faith that shows you haven't got faith you're just talking from your mouth but if you really got faith you believe it and act like it that's right put it in action Noah did he put it in action I love how he goes to that he went right on ahead building the ark Noah received the message for his day is that right yes Noah preached the message for his day Noah believed the message for his day and you have to say was Noah saved by faith alone without works Noah's Works were a Vindication of his faith and as his as this Faith come into Vindication it actually built the ark that saved him did Noah believe yes did other people work on the ark yes there was other people who worked on the ark there was probably lots of people who worked on the ark were they in the ark when the rains came no because they did The Works without faith but Noah did the works with faith and he was in the ship when the rain started to fall The Works and Faith came together in the message in that day amen so simple friends it's so simple I can say I believe the message all I want I believe the messenger I believe the message but you know what my actions actually prove where my heart really is and I'm ashamed to say that many times I found myself loving myself more than loving the message or the messenger but I've had to repent and repent and repent so I keep washing by the water of the word washing my own understanding until I I quit valuing my own opinion and I start putting value where God put value in the word that he delivered to us amen and I believe we still need some washing brother Ram said in the token I'm going to come back now to the Token as we close said oh that's nonsense what they talk about up there is crazy why there's no such a thing why you women there oh why you don't what's your you're dressing it what it does and brother R's not finishing his sentence he's clipping them but he he's talking about uh those who are are are sarcastic and they're talking about the Believers said what's your dressing and he's talking about what's your dressing have to do with it you can tell by the context and brother M said it does the Bible said so what your hair have any and he clipped it again said the the Bible said so that's just a differ see touch not handle not taste not he is God see now it does mean something brother man's not saying it doesn't mean anything he says no it means something the way we dress the way we we cut our hair and not cut our hair the way we conduct ourselves the things we do and we don't do it does mean something it's not that it has no meaning the problem is if you make your salvation based on that with no genuine faith it will do you no good you'll be bankrupt at the end of the day but my goodness if you have faith but you won't have the audacity to do what the messenger taught it shows you don't really believe correctly about the messenger right the two have to come together he again further down in the token he says why you know that day when Rahab the Harlot put that string down that string I imagine some of them soldiers laughed and made fun said that crazy old woman up there she's off her head look her uh look her got it in there and they started laughing why did you ever hear of such Why Dr Jones sat down there there ain't nothing to that but there was because a messenger from God brought the message and told them could you imagine the Egyptians saying look say look at the crazy bunch of Holy Rollers putting blood haha won't that have a mess to wash off now oh my then big fine homes all covered with blood oh such a stink I bet you that'll be horrible in a few days and won't mean a thing you know why Holy Father so and so but there was it was it did mean something amen why did it mean something because God's Prophet told him to do it and because God's Prophet told him to do it it meant something when The Messengers from the presence of Joshua came into Jericho amen what did that Scarlet thread have to do with anything what did that piece of cord had to do with anything how was a piece of cord going to save somebody it wasn't that it was her obedience to what the messengers told her it signaled a covenant What was the blood of a lamb over a door it was what God instructed them through a prophet when they had resp respect for God's Prophet they were saved by what Rahab was saved I going to ask you what was Rahab saved by what effort what work what what what all did she have to do to be saved in that day she just had to do what the messengers told her to do right amen simple obedience to the instructions amen I don't want to make it super complicated I just want to believe the messag amen I want to believe it with my whole heart I want to believe it with no inhibitions I want anything that's holding me back I want it to be purged out of my life so that I can fully Embrace what God has brought us in this day because full obedience to the full word of God entitles us to the Token brother bam says I've read this the last two sermons we preached from the token he says don't just come this far are I believe the message you obey the messenger amen come into Christ you say well I believe every word said brother that's good but that's just being able to read take the message take it into your heart that you must have the token the very life that was in Christ be in you when I see that I will pass over you amen amen again in the token he says what does what does he do then when you have when you can present present the token with your prayer when you have the token and you can present the token with your prayer it shows that you have fully come to obedience to the whole word of God then you've got the token it shows that you have obeyed every word then you and the word are one you're only asking for the thing that you are you become the word by letting the word flow through you you become the word by receiving the word what is the message the word it's Christ it's the word it's the anointed word for our day and when we receive the word we become the word and when you present your token with your prayer you're only asking for what you are and when you present that token it's an evidence that you have obeyed every word that's what the prophet says so you can't tell me obeying is not important obeying is pivotal it's crucial am it's an expression of what we believe this is what brother bam says towards the end of the token and I want to finish with this says now this is this is good instruction right now now just sweetly and humbly with all that's in your heart weigh down deep just accept it not in our brains our brains are so fickle they'll agree one day and disagree the next it'll come easy one time will come hard the next time you'll understand it during one sermon the next sermon you won't even understand it that's our brains but sweetly and humbly with all that's in your heart weigh down deep just accept it don't fight it don't try to work around it don't try to find a way to still have what we want and have the message to just accept it for what it is it's Christ in our day it's the full word of God Amen the the full word of God Vindicated the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication just receive it and accept it that way amen that to quit making excuses for it or workarounds just accept it accept it the be absolutely true with all that's in your heart way down deep just accept it say Lord Jesus right now just take all that's in me that's unlike you and let me move all my pride all that's in me out all the trash all the unbelief that's in me I discard it now Lord I just kick it out and let the Sweet Holy Spirit of God like a dove move down in me I want to live eternally Lord I want you to help me at this time Grant it now man let's all stand musicians if you'll come and brother Blake if you'll please come I'm going to read that while we're standing and I want you to take it into your heart and realize it may be much simpler than we think it might just be a true repentance a genuine changing of our mind and recognizing that this message is perfect it doesn't need it manipulated doesn't need explained the way it doesn't need excuses made for it amen it needs to be accepted amen what we need is a greater surrender I remember when I first come to the message and I would listen and everything brother Brenham said I went into immediate action I mean there was always some wrestling matches times but I kicked out stuff and kicked out stuff and kicked out stuff because I had lived such a nominal life and there's so much part of my life I remember I remember the greatest victory in my life in that time was when I actually cut the cable to the cable TV I actually cut it and that was one of the greatest victories of my life to that time pretty pathetic right now but and I remember uh I remember times when people would say oh we went through our legalistic phase and I've reflected back on that and you know what I never went through a legalistic phase because I never believed those things were my salvation I believed what that man said to be true amen and of God and I wanted to line up to it amen you know what I went through I went through a simple obedience phase and it got labeled by some as a legalistic phase right but it wasn't a legalistic phase cuz I wasn't hypocritical in doing it I was honest and sincere I didn't believe it equated my salvation but I did believe it was the right thing to do because that Prophet was a prophet of God and I knew whatever he told me was true amen maybe we need to go back to a simple obedience face amen where we're so eager to get rid of stuff so eager to shed the world so eager to push it away not eager to find halfway way decent not too bad right you know what I mean oh God takeing me back to my first love amen take me back to innocency where I just saw it and I just believed it and I was willing to act on it that's where I want to stay friends amen have we gotten so wise have we become so well-versed in the message have we been so good at manipulating one one quote against another that we found ways to still have our own lustful desires still be in the message say God help us help me help me to be honest help me to be true help me to be genuine and help Lord God please give me a true repentance and wash my mind oh God give me a pure understanding and revelation of this word amen so that I can bring forth Works meat for repentance I want my Works to display my faith and I want my Works to display my love love for God not to prove anything to another human being and not to purchase for me salvation or even bonus programs from God I'm not here to get merit badges I'm not here to get stickers so I can get a bonus from God Amen that's not what it's about but with all my heart I want to show my love to him by my obedience to his word by my surrender to the voice that he chose in this age my my respect to the one that he's placed over the age I want to show my love to him that way right NO legalistic phase but maybe just a simple humble surrendered heart maybe we should stay right there maybe we should have never grown out of that to become wise in our own conceit say God help me sweetly and humbly with all that's in my heart weigh down help me just to accept it Lord and say Lord with all my heart I love you God and I'm going to read this again Jesus right now just take all that's in me that's unlike you let me move all my pride all that's in me out all the trash all the unbel belief that's in me I discard it now Lord I just kick it out and let the Sweet Holy Spirit of God like a dove moved down in me I want to live eternally Lord I want you to help me at this time Grant it man let's just bow our heads and pray this to the Lord Lord Jesus God we've read the quote but Lord to me I want it to be more than a quote Lord I want it to be the Cry of my heart God I want to surrender my own selfishness right now I ask that you take it away Lord I've made excuses where I shouldn't have made excuses and I'm sorry Lord but God you know the desire of my heart you know the faith that's in me for Lord it comes from the seed you've planted in there but God I with all my heart want to be purged of all my selfishness and pride all my self-preservation and self-d desires let it all Fade Away Lord and may I with a pure heart just accept your word and the Simplicity that it comes forth in help me God not to make it complicated but just simply Lord help me to have a heart that'll say yay in amen help me to have a desire in my heart just to surrender all and God if you should expose anything else in my life that's not like you Lord I Surrender it to you now and I ask that you wash me with the washing of the Water by Your Word cleans my mind Lord my understanding give me a greater repentance day by day that I might have a change a change of mind a change of my thinking to where I think like you think God I want to surrender I pray if there's any here Lord who's not yet received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and doesn't have that seal God I pray that they would do like Rahab did that they would simply obey that they would do like the children of Israel did in The Exodus at the Passover that they would obey because we know that you give the Holy Ghost to them that obey may they obey the message Lord may they obey the messenger may they surrender all absolutely all of self may they lay it down now in a complete repentance and Lord if they've not been baptized in your name may they come to be baptized in your name not titles but the Living God your name the Lord Jesus Christ if they have been bapt baptized Lord I pray that you'd bring and confirm the promise of the word for if you don't through a true repentance and a proper baptism if you don't bring the baptism of Holy Ghost then you said something wrong and we know that's impossible Lord so I pray God that you would give us a heart to repent bring us to the right baptism and help us to surrender all and then rest and trust that you will absolutely keep your word in our lives for it cannot fail God where we've been failing to surrender I pray that we could surrender now Lord help our works display our love for you Lord the the love that we reciprocate back because you first loved us and now may we express that love and our surrender to your will and our obedience we love you God we thank you God for your word we thank you for the truth we thank you God for sending a prophet in our day to bring us the balance understanding on these things God if we should get to the right or to the left Lord on this journey of life I pray God that you'd would chasen us and bring us back to the center of your will for we want to preach and teach and understand your truth in all things help us God we love you father I commit these people to you I ask that you do a supernatural powerful and eternal work in their lives and in my life as well in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you like will change my heart oh God make it
