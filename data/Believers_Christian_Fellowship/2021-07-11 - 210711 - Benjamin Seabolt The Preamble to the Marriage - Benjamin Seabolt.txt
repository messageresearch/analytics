TRANSCRIPT
========================================
just a little while too late just a little more redeem over in that promised yes what a blessed it's and always a little more of trouble in a slow and sinful state that will enter heaven's mortal and we'll take them by the hands over in that promised land oh then we'll be at home forever that eternal lord just a little it's always amen aren't you looking forward to that morning you're my victory for me you're my righteousness oh [Music] and shalom [Music] [Applause] your mother for me [Music] i am set free you are with me [Music] are more than so much more than you are [Music] precious lord jesus father that is our declaration here this morning lord as we come to you unworthily father uncapable unable lord but you are more than enough father that you are the only one who is worthy you are the only one who is capable and able lord we just want to come this morning and submit ourselves to you lord knowing that you through us makes us worthy father it will make us capable it will make us able for you are truly more than enough lord we would just ask that you would come have the preeminence lord i pray that you would just anoint the speaker that you would just anoint the hearer that you would come this morning and accomplish that which you have preordained before the foundation of the world lord that this would not just be a social gathering or a sterile teaching lord but you would come and do that which only you can do in the supernatural lord to come and to take the book and to break the seals and to feed your sheep father that there would be spiritual growth growing forward this morning lord that we would move farther in your plan of redemption lord that we would do our part through the foolishness of preaching and hearing of your word we thank you for truth lord we thank that you give thank you that you've given us something to preach lord that we don't have to come here and think of man's thoughts or try to put something together lord but you have came and given of yourself lord that we would have truth to walk by and we just pray that you would expound that to us this morning anoint us now for your service we pray in jesus christ's name the bride says amen god bless you if you would turn in your bibles before you're seated we'll go to revelation chapter 19 verse number 7 thank you musicians i greet you this morning in the name of the lord jesus christ it's good to be with you this morning i realize we have a wedding today and this was not one purpose that i chose to preach this but i'm going to speak on the preamble to the marriage and it's literally the preamble to the marriage but i didn't plan that it's and it has nothing to do with that but yet it has everything to do with that but not that specific marriage um so it's just kind of the way that it worked out but i promise i'll have you all out of here by three o'clock so you'll have plenty enough time to get to the wedding maybe slightly before that but at least by three o'clock so you can just relax and we can enjoy the word this morning revelation chapter 19 verse 7 says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready this is a very strange verse because it says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him why are you giving honor to him when the wife has made herself ready why wouldn't you be giving honor to the wife you can have your seats we realize it's because he is more than enough and it's through him that is the only way that the wife has made herself ready so without him it would be impossible for him for her to have even stood a chance to make herself ready so all honor is due to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready i want to look at what we would commonly refer to as a story that brother branham told in the message the choosing of a bride and were this is where my inspiration comes for this uh sermon if you want to call it that but we're very familiar with this story um brother branham has told it multiple times and uh very familiar but i found it very striking that he would come to this message the choosing of the bride which we know is just a cornerstone message of his ministry there in los angeles and just a a extremely significant juncture in time especially for that city for the pentecostal people at that time um and just a i'm not saying that there's one message more important than the other but you understand there there are certain times that brother branham is literally fleshing out scripture um he's standing there as the eliezer calling abroad he's standing there as the seventh file angel literally pouring out the seventh vial so it's not that one is more one message is more important than the other but there's just certain significance to certain messages that he would come to this this message and he would tell this story and he would lay this story if if you're familiar with that message choosing of the bride brother branham comes at the beginning of that and he starts he starts talking to them to them about his ministry and he says now this dr this monster that just whipped his tail farther up the coast it could come down this way any time and you all are asking me is it coming this way brother branham is it coming this way he says i don't know i don't know i don't have a direct word from the lord i don't know i can't tell you until i know he says that's the reason you have the faith in me that you have is because i've never just you know spouted off something i wait for the lord to tell me and then i tell you he's like now you know no man can do that and he comes again he says there was a little sister in my church she came she had had a dream she wanted to know the interpretation of the dream and brother brandon told her he says i think i know what that dream means sister but until i see it myself and then god gives me the interpretation i can't tell you that that's what it means he says i can't tell you that because if i was wrong and then there was a real significant juncture in your life that you needed a word from the lord from me you wouldn't know whether it was from the lord or not you would maybe think i was just guessing again and he he comes back around and he says now the uh the brother he said that's been in this these meetings he used to come and and look at the prayer cards of the people coming through and he said he would examine those to see if what i told him on the platform was correct if it was the same thing that they had written on the card he says never one time did it miss and he's laying this down at the beginning of this message and he keeps repeating now you know no man can do that you know no man can do that you know only god can do that you know god has to be present to do that what is he doing remember what he's preaching he's preaching the choosing of a bride there's about to be a marriage take place and it is impossible to have a marriage unless both parties are present and what he's trying to prick their conscience to is this is not a man just being present that he is literally here that it this has been god through this ministry he has come he is here there can be a marriage take place because this hasn't been a man this has been god so eliezer is going forth and he's letting them know the bridegroom is present a man cannot do this so he lays that down right at the beginning of that message and he he begins talking that there's a choice coming for the pentecostal people he says you know he's warning them about the world council of churches coming in and he just tells them flatly he tells them you're going to have to make a choice you're going there is going to come a day that you are going to have to choose between your denomination and the word what's he doing remember what he's preaching the choosing of a bride the bride has to make a choice he's standing there preaching the choosing of the bride but he's just making these comments beforehand laying that foundation letting them know that there is a choice coming there is a proposal coming there is a proposal being made because he is here and recognize that for who it is so he he lays that down very very early in that message and then he comes and he tells this story right in the middle of the message he tells a story he tells a story we think it's a story we've heard it before he's told it other times it's the same story but he comes after he does that and he tells this story so let's read this story and then we're going to expound on that by the grace of god paragraph 85 he says i've married many couples but it always reminds me of christ and his bride one of the weddings that i performed here some time ago was quite an outstanding thing in my life it's been several years ago when i was just a young minister now i'm paraphrasing some of this for time's sake but you all are familiar with this you can read it yourself starting paragraph 85 he says my brother was working on the pwa and there was a boy that worked up there with him from indianapolis he said to my brother one day i want to get married if i just had enough money to pay the preacher doc said well my brother is a preacher and he may marry you he said he never charges people for things like that well that night my brother asked me and i said well if he's never been married before either one of them and everything is all right so when saturday came along the boy came down he's it's been a great thing for me to always look back upon this it was a rainy afternoon in an old chevrolet car with the headlights wired on with belling wear belling wire that drove up and out got a out got a boy out of the car and he said certainly did not look like a groom to me or would to anybody he had on a pair of shoes like was run over and his trousers was real baggy he had on one of these old moleskin jackets looks like he had been run through a washing machine without being rinsed and a little lady got out with a little checkered look dress and she didn't have hardly any shoes on she had hitchhiked from indianapolis had a little hair and long kind of plaits down her back looked very young and i said to her and by this time most of us has already tuned out because we've already heard this story a dozen times i said to you said to her are you old enough to get married she said yes sir she said i have my written permission from my father and mother she said i had to show it to the court here to get my license and i said i'd like to talk to you a little bit before we perform this wedding and they sat down the boy kept looking around the room he needed a haircut real bad and he kept looking around the room he wasn't listening to me and i said son i want you to listen to what i'm saying he said yes sir and i said do you love this girl he said yes sir i do and i said to her do you love him yes sir i do i said now have you got a place to take her after you marry said yes sir said all right no i said i want to ask you something i understand you're working up here on the pwa and he said yes sir that's about 12 a week i said you think you can make a living for her he said i'll do all that i can and i said well that's all right and i said now what if he what if he gets out what if he loses his job sister what are you going to do you going to run back home to mama to papa she said no sir i'm going to stay with them and i said what sir if you have three or four children nothing to feed them and you haven't got any work what are you going to do then send her away he said no sir i'll struggle right on we'll make it somehow he said i felt real little said i seen that he really loved her he said i married them if every marriage that ever took place would follow this pattern we would have zero divorces if every church that would move forward would follow this pattern we would have zero church splits we would have zero false ministries we would have zero hypocrisy i want to look at this in such simplicity but remember what he's preaching and remember who this is this is the seventh vile angel this is the seventh vile angel at the end of this message he is going to express through his lips the very words that's going to sink california this is the this is the seventh final angel preaching the choosing of the bride a huge juncture in time let me tell you a story about this couple that i married had bailing wire on the headlights poor close what is he doing there are seven phases to this preamble to the marriage i don't know why there's seven there just happens to be seven but the first thing that he does is he makes them both be present but he says are you old enough to be married he asked the lady are you old enough to be married he wants to make sure there's no legal implications in place he can't perform this wedding if she's not old enough to be married he could perform it but it would be void it would be irrelevant it would be pointless he has to ascertain that she is at an age that is legally allowed to be married what is he doing though i would i would venture to say that the same thing christ asked us when he is coming and looking for a bride i wonder if christ asked us the same thing are you old enough to be married we say we're married we say we're the bride of christ we say we're the wife of christ but are we old enough to be married are we spiritually mature enough to actually be married or are we just saying we're married see you can say you're old you're you can be married you can you can proclaim something but is it really true because if you if you aren't spiritually mature enough to be married then the marriage is null and void he has to to make sure that the preresect is fulfilled before he can move on are you old enough to be married are you spiritually mature enough to be married have you followed the preresequence we come and we try to say that we're the wife of jesus christ the bride of jesus christ and we haven't even repented or taken his name in water baptism you are not the bride of jesus christ you may be the bride of jesus christ in the future but you're not right now you have not spiritually matured enough you have not become of age you are of legal age to be married does that make sense there is a pre-recipient to this marriage there's something that there's a condition that has to be met before he can move on now i'm not talking about a relationship he never asked them are you old enough to be in a relationship he never asked him are you old enough to be involved here he asked her are you old enough to be married there's a huge difference between a relationship and a marriage a relationship you can go back on a marriage is death do you part are you old enough for that obligation are you old enough for that for that for that joining that spiritual union or are you still just flirting with the word are you does is it really the only way for you or is there another way for you have we come to a spiritual age of maturity that we can say yes yes i am old enough to be married farther more i have my written permission i have my written permission i have met the preresequence see brother branham said god wants to give you the holy ghost more than you want to have it but he can't fill a dirty vessel we come seeking that marriage the baptism of the holy spirit the the indwelling presence of christ himself we come seeking that but we haven't met the preresequence we can't come boldly and say yes i'm old enough lord i am old enough i am here i am desiring this mess this this marriage i am old enough and furthermore i have your written permission i have repented i have been baptized in your name there is no other condition needed to be met for you to marry me can we say that can we say that a true repentance a true repentance from everything from from from all of our understanding a true repentance see you can be baptized all that you want but if you haven't repented it does no good and you can say that you've repented all that you want but until you're godly sorrowful for what you need to repent of there's no repentance you see this is really really simple you're right it is it's as simple as the seventh vile angel coming to preach choosing to the bride and say let me tell you a story about this poor couple i married several years ago but do we skip right over top of it and miss it do we just want to move right into a marriage without meeting the conditions and then one day get down here and realize our marriage is null and void because we weren't spiritually mature enough to meet the conditions we didn't have our written permission to meet the conditions to be qualified for the marriage and again i am not talking about a relationship i'm not trying to take anybody's relationship away from them there's there's a process to that we understand but i'm talking about a marriage i'm talking about the marriage of the lamb and it has to follow this same pattern it has to follow if you if you read this story that brother branham tells he always touches on these same points it never changes that wasn't coincidence there was there was if you want to say a routine there was a procedure that he stuck to for these situations but that first one that he wanted to ascertain was if she was old enough to be married we obviously know that the natural types the spiritual and that's what we want to look at are we spiritually mature enough to really say i am prepared i am willing i meet the conditions to be married to the lamb of god to be married to the word of god to be married to the message of the allah i've not been married before that's been put away there's no prior conditions that prohibit me from moving forward in this man in this marriage i am present he i recognize him as being present and i recognize that i have fulfilled my obligations in the word to a point that i am spiritually old enough spiritually mature enough to ask him to fulfill this marriage to conduct this marriage i said to her are you old enough to get married she said yes sir i have my written permission from my father and mother she said i had to show it to the court here to get my license i want to look at a quote in 1959 be certain of god brother ram says you see ahab was reigning in israel and he was the wickedest of all the kings of israel there had been no king as wicked as ahab now he tells you why he was wicked for he being taught and knowed better he continued to displease god in everything that he did although he had great military system and the people had become very prosperous under his reign but yet you cannot please god i'm sorry you cannot displease god and expect to get by very long and then in his wedding instead of marrying among his own people he went over and married a sinner an idolater worshiper of idols he married jezebel and she was not a believer and no believer should ever marry an unbeliever under no circumstances there's no wiggle room there there's no butts there's no gray areas no believer should ever marry an unbeliever under no circumstances period that's a good foundational starting point for anybody that's looking to be married don't even let it cross your mind under no circumstances none zero zilch period should a believer ever even consider marrying an unbeliever that's per the seventh bible angel not me should always marry a believer but ahab had done this evil thing and no doubt that what jezebel was a beautiful woman and he had fell for what she looked like instead of what she was that so many people make that same mistake today so many people make that same mistake today you say well i know somebody that married an unbeliever and they're still married they're sitting in the house of god they're worshiping god they're fine it turned out just right go ask them how many scars they got go ask them what they could have avoided had they waited see i will not deny that if you're a believer god can reveal to you this person over here is my wife my husband and they're an unbeliever i will not deny that but there's a scripture for that and the scripture says watch and pray it doesn't say just watch see you can watch and god can reveal something to you but if you don't pray you'll get ahead of the word and you'll find yourself breaking the word and you'll find yourself with a bunch of scars and you'll find yourself outside of the will of god and you will find yourself as ahab the wickedest person on the face of the earth because you knew better you were taught better and you did it anyhow and you have nobody to blame but yourself under no circumstances should a believer ever marry an unbeliever watch and pray because if if you are a believer and god has revealed to you that that is your mate and they're not in a condition of being spiritually mature enough or in a condition of being a believer for you to marry them and move forward in a relationship then god has to move them into the position watch and pray wait and pray but how many times have we got ahead of god not just in the marriage but in any situation god can reveal something and we want to move forward before the proper timing before the proper conditions are met so that all of the word can be kept remember abel had a revelation of a proper sacrifice but abel also had the revelation of proper timing for a sacrifice so it's not it's not just the way but it's the timing as well and god can never break his word to fulfill his word he's not he's not going to break his word to fulfill his word he's not going to reveal to you this is my mate and let you marry them to fulfill his word but yet he's breaking his word by letting you marry somebody who's in an unbelieving condition praise the lord we'll move on titus 2 4 i'm sorry titus 2 and 1 to verse 14. says but speak thou the things which become sound doctrine that the age man be sober grave temperant sound in faith in charity in patience remember we're talking about a a wedding we're talking about the preamble to the marriage these are the conditions you should be looking for we're speaking naturally right now but we're also speaking spiritually if you'll catch it the age men be sober grave temperate sound in faith in charity in patience the aged women likewise that they be in a behavior as becoming becometh holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chase keepers at home good obedient to their husbands that the word of god be not blasphemed young men you say well that was to the old people young men likewise exhort to be sober minded if you're marrying this guy because he's the one he's always the funny guy and he makes you laugh that don't match titus too there's nothing wrong with humor brother brandon says god loves humor but that's not anywhere in here when it says when titus is giving instructions on what to look for and how we should conduct ourself that's that's not a characteristic to show that somebody's spiritually mature he says young men likewise exhort to be sober minded in all things showing thyself a pattern of good works in doctrine showing uncorruptness gravity sincerity sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say against thee exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters and to please them well in all things not answering again not speaking back not sassy not purloining that that word means to cheat or to steal but showing all good fidelity that they may adorn the doctrine of god our savior in all things for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope the glorious appearing of the great god and our savior jesus christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from redeem us from all iniquity and purify and to himself a peculiar people zealous of good works in the natural if you are approaching a marriage situation or a relationship situation i would check it through this chapter i would check it through this chapter is this person sober are they sober minded grave are they temperate are they sound in the faith in charity in patience if it's a lady is her behavior that which becometh holiness or is she still flirting with the world not false accusers not given to much wine teacher of good things a teacher of good things that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children you say well she's a young woman she's not a mother she's not in that position okay is she receptive to being sober is she receptive to just loving her husband to loving her children is she acting in a way of holiness not false accusing not given to much wine a teacher of good things is she interested in being discreet being chased being a keeper at home good obedient to her husband that the word of god be not blasphemed see we're talking about spiritual maturity a prerequisite to a marriage does she have her written permission does he have his written permission does he even know what his faith is is he sound in his doctrine is he capable of taking a headship role sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say is his testimony such that nobody has anything to say about him negative to say about him or her likewise remember we're speaking naturally but think spiritually is that our testimony before the lord we're wanting to be married to him we're proclaiming we're married to him but have we met the conditions for that marriage do we have this written permission teaching us that denying ungodliness verse 12 teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our savior jesus christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify into himself a peculiar people zealous of good works remember if you try to meet these conditions yourself you're going to fail that's why he says in verse 13 looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our savior jesus christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works remember this is what he's going to he is going to do through you to put you into a condition that he can marry you we have to meet that condition absolutely but we're not going to meet that condition through our own merits through our own self-will through our own efforts but we have to come to him who is able to do that that's sobering i know it's quiet i know but what i don't want to happen is for us to get down the road and think we're in a marriage and really all we were in was a relationship and we never actually got to the marriage there's nothing wrong with the relationship the relationship is essential but the relationship is for a purpose and the purpose is for a marriage and the remarriage is for reproduction for christ to reproduce himself remember that's the point the relationship understand what i'm saying the relationship's not the point the marriage is not the point reproduction is the point brother brown says why did the son of man do this why did he come again why is he here in this ministry to reproduce himself again through you and me remember that's the end goal that's the purpose what was adam and eve's what was adam's first instructions multiply and replenish the earth farther express christ that's the purpose but we we're never going to get to the purpose if we try to skip the pre-resequence and we don't want to get confused about why am i not reproducing christ why am i not able to reproduce christ maybe you haven't actually married him maybe you're still stuck in the relationship portion moving to a marriage and again i'm not taking that away you're never going to get to a marriage without a relationship or at least you shouldn't but let's make sure that we have the end goal inside let's make sure that we have our written permission let's make sure that there is nothing that's going to to void our marriage 1957 continuing with this thought that titus lays down 1957 brother brainer says he was to pass that way in the message that he was to pass that way god knows that we need more women like that today when womanhood is broke the backbone of the nation is broke a woman's place is at home with her children now if her husband's sick and she has to work that's different but woman's place is at home in the kitchen and when she leaves that she's out of her place exactly right we don't hear that too awful much anymore around what we would call the ranks of the message that's not as popular as it used to be it's not as palatable as it used to be that's not as culturally culturally acceptable as it used to be but i'll remind you the seventh vile angel said it he said when she gets out of the kitchen she's out of her place that's just as much the message as revelation 10 7. when she gets out of the kitchen she's out of her place 1965 the choosing to the bride he says now for it is becoming if a christian would choose a wife he ought to choose a genuine born-again woman regardless of what she looks like if he marries a girl that ain't got enough moral about her to stay home and take care of a house and wants to work out in somebody's office what kind of a housekeeper will she be you'll have babysitters and everything else it's true now i'm not much of this modern taste modernistic taste of women working where is he getting that from titus 2 titus 2 is where he's getting that from 1957 questions and answers he says now look in america day in america today are women a young man from kentucky told me a few days ago there was 800 women working at a certain plant here in kentucky and he said i could possibly feel safely and swearing that 400 of them is absolute street prostitutes and married women with children one guy took his wife out there and worked her up with the board and then he liked to kill her and another one went on to shoot a man and another one cutting and fighting that shouldn't be that's not right put women back in the kitchen where she belongs then everything will be okay but you put her out there in the public work she's gone the american woman snicker up their nose and say there's nothing to that and you show me certainly you've got to do that the bible predicted you would do that you have to do it it used to be a long time ago in a methodist church if a woman cut her hair she was put out of the church certainly they did yes indeedy nazarenes pilgrim holiness pentecostals all of them used to do it but what happened you know why you got some sissies behind the pulpit that's exactly right somebody's afraid of their meal ticket afraid you'd excommunicate them run them out of the church they didn't have the very audacity to stand on god's word whether it hurt or whether it didn't that's exactly right listen here the man is the ruler don't think you'll rule the house you're not the ruler of the house you're not a slave now but you're a helpmate the man has the rule over his wife and he's responsible solely for his wife god makes the man answer for his wife now read and see if god says that now where is he getting that titus 2. now i'm going to read something else it'll throw you for a loop 1964 questions and answers brother branham are women allowed to work in public affairs when they have a healthy husband and children i am asking this question for somebody else lovely well i don't know about that i can't say but i just have this feeling let me say this i believe if a woman and i know that my if i was a woman and i know that my husband was healthy and had a good job working i believe it would be a great pleasure for me to stay home and take care of my children and raise them up and to love the lord and if i had any time from my washing and things that i was going to do i would teach my children how to serve the lord now if you've got a debt or something that you're trying to help your husband pay for or something that you have to do that well i think that's fine if you'll try to help him and you live a lady and i think it's hard no man that's got a good understanding you say well maybe we've been hard on the women so far think about this no man that's got a good understanding wants his wife to get into a bunch where there's a bunch of vulgar dirty men and things like that but if the woman has to get out i think that her husband ought to know that she's a genuine christian that can be trusted a trustworthy woman but now to say that she shouldn't work i don't know i don't know see there's always a loophole there's always something you can find to justify it if you want brother rem said he didn't know read what he said before that see there's no scripture to back that up i'm just passing that opinion he's saying there's no scripture that says thou a woman thou shalt not work out in public affairs he's saying there's no scripture to back that up i'm just passing that opinion but i think if a woman wants to work and she wants to work now i'm certainly against woman women working in these offices where all these businessmen they carry on they tell dirty jokes and a nice clean woman sitting there and all these smutty dirty things being told around like that i'm against that i think you ought to come out from among such stuff as that but now if a woman can hold herself as a real lady and try to help her husband do something some clothes for the kids to go to school or to pay off a bill or something like that and she wants to work until that's over now this not the lord because i don't have no scripture for this i'm just saying that be my opinion but otherwise i wouldn't think just because she wants to work just to run around and have more money to spend to run around and to run to bar rooms or drink and smoke and carry on i don't think she should do that i think she should stay home try to be a lady take care of her house see brother branham is not trying to take black and white and say thou shall and thou shalt not because if he does that what happens there's no relationship it's just a letter of the law which would be fun there's nothing wrong with the letter of the law but that's not what christ was after christ was after a relationship so it's why brother it's the same reason brother branham would stand there and blast cutting women's hair dyeing their hair perming their hair wearing but he would blast that to no end and then he would say now if you're if you think you look sickly or you've got something going on and you need a little bit of collar then go ahead give me give me one or the other how can you do both because it's not a dictatorship it's a relationship the purpose is not just to keep the letter of the law if that was the purpose the scribes and pharisees were fine what he was after was a relationship understand and that's what he's saying with this same situation he's saying i'm not i'm not for women being out there working but brother branham is so is not so naive to think that there's not situations to where a woman has to work whether she's an orphan or whether her husband has passed away or like he said whether she's sick or whether they just came into a marriage in a in a poor financial situation and they're trying to pay some bills off but that's why he says what he says he says until that's over until that's done but what i'll caution you and let you know right often from first-hand experience is that laodicea will never let you have that over and done with there will always be something and if you give that cow enough rope it will hang itself and you will never get to enough is enough you've got to come back to the word of god you've got to come back to the word of god and you have to operate by revelation you have to operate by the scripture you have to operate by titus too you have to run it through that filter because if not laodicea will convince you that she has to work every day over time and if she doesn't we won't make it laodicea is a master of that and he says he gives a couple reasons here to justify her work and he says if she's trying to help her husband do something or to buy some some clothes for the kids to go to school i'm not convinced that he's saying she needs to go to work so you can buy the designer brand of clothes to go to school that are 40 more than the other ones that dad could have afforded but dad can't afford the designer brand you understand what i'm saying see saints there if you want loopholes you can find loopholes but that's not what he's after what he's after is remember the first question he asked are you old enough for the marriage are you spiritually mature enough for the marriage or are you still looking for loopholes to do what you really want to do the prerequisite to the marriage that's what he's talking about for the kids to go to school or to pay off a bill remember to pay off a bill not to create another bill so you have to pay that one off too see it you can't as a minister you can't stay up stand here and just throw a blanket over everything and say any woman that's working uh and any man that lets her work is out of the will of god i can't do that nobody can do that nobody can do that because there's too many situations you're foolish to try to do that but what i would say is look at the scripture run it through the scripture does it meet the conditions what is your mode of an objective what's the purpose what's the intent you say well i don't want money to run to the bar rooms and to drink and to smoke maybe you want it to carry on though maybe you want it for whatever reason and if that's if that's a godly holy justifiable reason then go for it i'm not here to condemn that situation what i'm trying to do is bring attention to what the motive and objective is to bring attention are we spirit are we operating at a spiritually mature level are we still stuck in laodicea in a laodicean condition and a laodicean mindset and in a cultural mindset it's getting to the point i'm just being honest with you it's getting to the point you can't even bring up these quotes in certain message circles with fellowship with people and i'm not pointing to churches or other ministries or anything i'm just i'm just saying it's getting to the point that just commonly associated with what we would say message believers it gets uncomfortable you start talking about these things why is that it should not be it should not be that way we should be comfortable saying that's what the seventh vile angel said that's what the seventh church age messenger said you say well he just said that was his opinion yeah okay that was just his opinion maybe you have a better one let me hear that no i don't want to hear that i'm gonna i'm gonna take the man who's standing in los angeles fleshing out the seventh vile angels ministry and i'm probably gonna give a little bit of weight to that opinion he's expressing his opinion why is he expressing his opinion because heggy i knew what the king liked because ellie easier eliezer knew abraham and he knew his son and he knew what he liked and he knew that anybody that would be interested in them would want to know what their opinion was and their opinion would be good enough he wasn't looking to tie rachel to the back of a camel and drag her there he was looking for her to want to go and if she was really the one she would be interested in isaac's opinion [Music] remember we're talking about a marriage you say no you're not you're just cutting the women down no i'm not and this is not to anybody god's honest truth i have no idea about anybody's situation what anybody's doing i have nobody in mind when i'm saying this i'm just preaching spiritual principles if it hits you praise the lord it's hit me before i wasn't going to do this and i'm probably going to end up crying when i do this but i'm going to do it anyhow just so you know i'm not cutting at you me and my wife were married for nine years no children my wife was working we came into the marriage with financial issues she worked we got those issues taken care of she continued to work that was my choice not hers just ask her she'll let you know but i was stuck in a condition to where we could not make it without that but the lord laid on my heart one day she's done cut it off done this was not good timing because i just went off work on disability with a back issue i was released from that job i was out of a job we were getting ready to build a house we just bought property to build the house on so like every condition that you can think of laodicea would line up to say this is not going to work if she does this it was there i'm not going to go through all the details for embarrassment's sake but i'm just letting you know this was not the proper timing this was not the proper timing but it was extremely clear she's done i told her you're done you're not going back two weeks notice on that day you're done within 48 hours of us making that decision she conceived with william you say well that's coincidental you're right you're right it's coincidental no it's a prerequisite it's lining up with the word of god it was a miracle the doctor you all know the testimony the doctors had told her she could not have babies but yet there was something hindering that and when that hindrance was moved god can do the supernatural so if you think i'm just cutting on somebody here you're wrong i'm not cutting on anybody i've been there i've done that i've made poor decisions i've made wrong decisions but what i'm here to tell you is you can make those decisions right and when you remove all barriers god can do the supernatural it was the worst timing possible for that decision worst timing possible worst timing possible but when god says do something you do it and then look what god has done look what god has done i wish god would stop actually but look what god has done praise the lord i guess it's payback for my wrong decisions but would i rather still be stuck struggling in a laodicean condition where enough is never enough or would i have rather had william at the worst possible time i'd rather have him i'd rather i'd rather be worse than what it was and still have him but that's what god can do so understand i'm not cutting at anybody and i'm not trying to point at anybody i've made those wrong decisions myself but what i'm saying is let's quit soft soaping those let's quit soft soaping those and let's let's recognize what the angel told us and let's be comfortable saying what the angel told us i don't care whether it is culturally appropriate or not in fact if it is culturally culturally appropriate it probably means it's wrong i don't care if the rest of the ranks of the message will preach it or not i'm going to preach it because it's what he said it's what we need it's a prerequisite to the marriage how are you going to marry christ still trying to take care of yourself not going to happen you young sisters oh lord help me i'm gonna get in trouble now if god has told you to go to college and get an education to provide for yourself then you do it but if you are operating out of fear that i might have to take care of myself you are wrong you are out of the will of god you have no right being there if god has told you to do it then you go do it but remember you as a human being operate by two forces fear or faith and if you are operating out of a what may be down the road out of fear that you might have to take care of yourself maybe you won't get married or if you're a if you're a married couple and you're trying to go and line yourself up for a career and in case something happens to your husband you are not operating out of revelation that is fear it is fear of what may take place and that is wrong that is wrong you we are not to operate out of fear and if god has revealed for you to go and to do that then it's not going to be operating out of fear and i don't care what field that is i don't care if it's one day of training or an eight-year college degree i don't care what it is but if you're moving into that path out of fear or out of what load of seeing will do laodicea will dump on you of what may be or what could happen or you better prepare for this or you better prepare for that you're wrong absolutely wrong it has to be by revelation god may reveal to you to go sign up for college as a lady for an year course just so you'll meet your husband on month number one and then you're done you say well god gave me a revelation for the for the for the eight month or for the eight year course don't miss the purpose remember check it by the word and if you've met your husband there and this is the one that you're that you're wanting to take care of you why would you still go through all of this to take care of yourself it's like us coming to christ and saying be my lord be my lord be my lord but i'm going to do this remember that's what leotis laodicean was rich increased with goods need of nothing but be my lord i don't i don't really need you i don't really need you to take care of me but be my lord no it's you're saying two opposite things you see that's really simple it is simple and i have no idea why i'm even preaching this but praise the lord we we get so revelated we get so revelated that we miss the simple things we get so revelated that we got women our message believing christian women back out in the workforce with no reason we were so revelated about being in a marriage and being the bride of jesus christ that were that we're flirting with fashions of the world adorning ourselves with things we shouldn't be you say well say something about the men i just did because if you're a man and you're allowing her to do that you don't even have a backbone that's what he said no you have a wishbone for a backbone we get so highly revelated in this marriage that we're in that i wonder sometimes are we really in a marriage when we're neglecting these simple things when we are when we're not spiritually mature enough just to stay home and take care of the house and take care of the kids and let him take care of us and not fall under the load of sea and fear well what if he can't take care of me i got i need to do this i need to prepare for this i need to no no we've missed it and that is what the devil specializes in that is what lodesia specializes in is fear fear of what could be fear of what could happen and you better prepare for that no a true marriage is rest for that lady she is resting she lays that veil over his shoulder he has inherited everything for her and if he goes down the tubes then he's going to have to have a plan to take care of her when he's down the tubes it's not see it's not her responsibility to have a backup plan because you can't as a lady i'm not just speaking naturally i'm speaking spiritually think you can't as a lady in the natural or the spiritual as bright bright of jesus christ you cannot be a true bride if you're constantly trying to come up with a backup plan because in order in order for you to even facilitate a backup plan you have to put yourself in a decision-making role and you're out you've you're off to begin with but it comes so slick and it comes so sly that we'll find ourselves operating out of fear and maybe we never act it out but we've already taken a a wrong spirit on ourselves and and made a backup plan god does not want you to have a backup plan no more than your husband wants you to have a backup plan if your husband needs you to have a backup plan he'll give you the backup plan if he's a true husband he will because that's what god does if god needs us to have a backup plan he'll give us a backup plan will he not let me ask you this what is your other option to come up with your own backup plan if you can't really trust him for everything what are you going to do are you going to you think your backup plan is going to work it is not going to work it is not going to work and you're going to be the wickedest person on the face of the earth because you've been taught better and you know better and you did it anyhow remember we're talking about a marriage a marriage for that lady is a full commitment not if this don't work out i'll try another i hope you catch what i'm saying i hope you're thinking spiritually remember we don't want to get down to the end of the line thinking we were married when we really weren't thinking we had met the conditions when we really hadn't there's a lot of natural things to preach when you're preaching on this topic topic there's a lot of spiritual principles that we could go down and they're important because if you don't have if you if you have no desire to flesh out naturally what you believe spiritually then what good is it but we also want to think spiritually and we don't want to assume that we're in a position that we're really not i am so lost right now i have no idea where i'm at you've got some sissies behind the pulpit that's exactly right somebody's afraid they're miltic and afraid they'll you'd excommunicate them run them out of the church they didn't have the very audacity to stand to stand on god's word whether it hurt or whether it didn't that's exactly right i don't ever want to be a i don't ever want to have the not have the audacity to say what he said whether it's culturally appropriate or not and i'm gonna move on i think but i just want to say this i'm not pointing that at anybody i've shared with you my my own situation look what god's done for me i'm not going to go into all the details with that but god is supernatural when you line up with the word of god he is supernatural there is nothing i think a lot of times we get so confused about what's going on and why isn't there supernatural happening in my life it's because we've got the channel clocked see the supernatural should be natural to the bride of jesus christ i think what happens a lot of times is we get so the channel so clogged up with things that won't go through the filter of the word that when we finally get it unclogged and god's able just to do something he normally would do we're like oh my goodness that was supernatural no it really wasn't it was just you getting the channel unclogged was william supernatural absolutely no doubts about it but maybe it was just me getting the channel unclawed maybe it was just me lining up with the word maybe it was just us forsaking our own understanding and saying we're going to do what god has said to do so i'm not pointing that in anybody i'm not trying to make it hard i'm not trying to offend anybody i'm not saying be a be offensive to be offensive you've got the wrong spirit if you're doing that but what i'm saying is don't be afraid of the word of god don't be ashamed of the word of god brother branham preached this raw he preached it rough he preached it unapologetically we should not be backing up on those things those simple things i found it so astounding i can't remember what message that it was but brother branham comes to the end of his ministry and he is desperately praying out to god and he says oh god i just long for the day remember who this is his position in the scripture and he is crying out to god in desperation i'm longing for the day and of all things that he could say what do you think he said i am longing for the day to see men just be men and women be women you tell me how simple this is you tell me how deep it is you tell me whether it should be preached or not you tell me whether it should be lived or not if we make it that simple don't worry about missing the marriage you're in a marriage you've made the marriage you have the nature of the husband you are reproducing the husband the word in the simplicity of it of all things that he could say that he longed for he just longed for the day when a man would be a man and a woman would be a woman so what i was going to say is i want to leave that topic with with this statement whatever you do man or woman do it by revelation don't do it by fear don't do it by fear don't do it out of what may be or what could happen do it by revelation because if you're doing it by revelation i can come here or any other minister can come here and preach it against something as hard as we can preach against it and it will never prick your heart because god has revealed for you to do something and that's what brother branham does here he says you know women working i can't say i don't have a scripture that says that said the lord women shouldn't work but he points you back to the relationship with the word why are you working why do you want to work so that's what i would just say i'm not throwing a blanket over every situation i can't do that nobody can do that brother branham didn't even do that all i'm saying is don't operate by fear be in a marriage be in a marriage be committed and just operate by revelation because if he reveals for you to do something you're safe in doing it there's no fear in doing it and you're perfectly fine but we look at that in the natural but that's exactly what the church does in the spiritual how many churches have tried to take care of themselves every denomination that is on the face of the earth has made that mistake brother branham said they did they said they got this much of the word they said oh my oh my goodness this may not be enough we got to build a fence around it and protect it that sounds like what he just said that's what the church has done do you think that's pleasing to god no that's what the churches have done they've tried to take care of himself god what i'm trying to say is god don't want you trying to take care of yourself that's what i'm trying to say praise the lord finally got it out praise the lord brother brown says in the choosing of a bride the same applies by choosing a church now you must pray over the church that you are fellowshipping in remember churches carry spirits now i don't want to be critical but i realize that i'm an old man and i got to leave here one of these days and i've got to answer at the day of judgment for what i say to you tonight or any other time and therefore i've got to be dead earnest and truly convicted but you go into a church and you'll watch the behavior of that pastor watch what the past watch the pastor a while and you'll usually find that the church acts like the pastor sometimes i wonder if we don't just get one another spirit instead of the holy spirit you get to a place where a pastor is real radical and carrying on you'll find the congregation is the same way i'll bring you to a church where i see the pastor stand and jerk his jerk his head back and forth you watch the congregation they do the same thing you take a pastor that just gulps down anything usually the church will do the same thing so if i was choosing a church i'd choose a genuine fundamental full gospel bible church if i was choosing one to put my family in why do they act like the pastor just for the record i don't think there's anything wrong with acting like our pastor in some aspect in some aspects i do same with me in some aspects that's good some aspects most aspects that's not good but the point i'm making here is why why do they imitate the pastor why do these churches take on one another's spirit instead of the holy spirit is because they're in a relationship and they're not in a marriage if they're in a marriage they if they're if you're in a marriage to christ the holy spirit you don't need your pastor's spirit but if you're not in a marriage and you're constantly searching for something you're going to imitate something that's before you the closest thing that you know maybe and that's not again that's not necessarily a bad thing that is not necessarily a bad thing but if you're if you've taken his spirit instead of the holy spirit you're wrong you've missed the point and that's what brother branham is saying here that that's what churches do churches do that they take on a man spirit a minister spirit because they failed to get the holy spirit they failed now look these people what if the pastor is holy nothing wrong with him act and holy what if he's sober what if he's grave what if he's all that all that list that we just went down what if he's all of those things and the church is acting just like that this is a good thing this is a good thing there's nothing wrong with that but it's not the point the point is to take the holy spirit the point is to get him and then you may or may not act like the pastor if the pastor has the holy spirit you'll probably act like him but you're not acting like him to act like him you're acting like him because that's what the holy spirit does does that make sense but brother brother branham is preaching choosing of a bride saints and listen to what he's talking about he's talking about people in a church who act like the pastor why is he telling us this is because they've missed the choosing of a bride they have missed the marriage that's why they're in this condition we don't want to be in that condition we want the holy spirit we want the word for ourselves we want our own relationship we want our own proposal we want our we want our own engagement and we want our own marriage we have to have that or we've missed the point because the point is to reproduce him not reproduce the pastor because eventually even if that pastor is right eventually he's going to fall because he's still in hybrid flesh just the same as me and you is going to fall because we're in hybrid flesh but if you take his spirit he's not going to fall you don't have to worry about watching the pastor or watching the minister or let's just watching your brother and sister it's not a relationship to where you compare yourself with one another as you compare yourself with him what good would it do for my wife to make everybody else happy if she doesn't make me happy what good would it do for me to make everybody else happy if i don't make my wife happy that's not the point that's not it's not that those relationships are nothing it's just that's not the point the point is the marriage and reproduction to reproduce christ and you can't do that with somebody else's spirit so check yourself what are you following what are you watching what are you guiding yourself by what are you looking for do you have your own relationship with him or is your relationship with him dictated by what a minister does what your brother and sister does just ask yourself that honest question he's preaching choosing of abroad and he's saying watch a pastor of a church usually the church will act like them because they've missed the choosing of the bride they've missed the marriage that's what he's trying to lay out here in simplicity we don't want that as a minister we don't want that i love the way my pastor preaches i tell him that all the time he don't believe me but i tell him that all the time but i don't want to mimic him and even if i do mimic him i'm not doing it on purpose i am who i am i'm comfortable with who i am but i've heard ministers i kid you not you can play one tape recorder and play the other tape recorder and you can't tell who's who because they just mimic each other they mimic it's it's repulsive it's repulsive but it's it's that bad they just mimic what the other one does and you cannot tell them apart why would god put two gifts the exact same on earth at the same time that's not of god there's different avenues that the spirit works through brother branham says he made you a specific way so you would ting a certain way why does why do you even want your team to match this thing that tells me that you're watching this thing and you're not watching the master team you're not watching the master if you're trying to imitate something else so even as minister ministries can do that churches as a whole can do that somebody over here will sing a song this church has got to sing the song why do we see those things saints and again they may be fine the song may be fun the ministry may be fine perfectly fine nothing wrong with it but that's not what god's after he's after the marriage to him he's after reproduction of him that's why we see those things we don't want that we want a marriage to him we want to be old enough and spiritually mature enough to move into a marriage with him praise the lord moving on this part will be a much more sweet in your mouth not better in your belly i'll have you jumping and shouting before i'm done he says i said i'd like to talk to you for a little bit continuing in this story and choosing abroad before we perform this wedding and there is no way i'm going to get through so i may stop after this and we'll see i'd like to talk to you a little bit before we perform this wedding and they sat down the boy kept looking around the room he needed a haircut real bad and he kept looking around the room he wasn't listening to me i said son i want you to listen to me he said yes sir now remember he's already asked the first question to her are you old enough to get married affirmative yes old enough to get married got my permission now look where he transitions to transitions to the man he says do you love this girl he said yes sir i do you say that's simple yep it is it's simple simple simple and there is the forest attorneys making millions of dollars because people can't even answer that simple question millions of dollars do you love this girl yes sir i do remember it's the preamble to the marriage this is one of the requirements do you love this girl so simple it is so simple it goes right over our heads do you love this girl yes sir i do in the church age book brother branham says and the lord god almighty says i know there he is standing in the midst of his people there he is the chief shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says i know i know your tribulation i am not at all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is to so many people like israel they wonder if god really loves them how can god be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer you see they could not figure out god's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but god said that his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation son i want you to listen to what i'm saying i want to ask you a question do you love this girl i would venture to say that 99 of your mental and psychological battles could be answered and solved by this simple question and coming to the recognition that he has declared he loves you he's answered the question saints this is not just a combination of questions that the prophet came up with spur of the moment he's listing these questions and asking these questions because this is god's way this is god's pattern this is god's requirement this is what god himself has done he didn't go rob the cradle and steal some little girl that didn't have a choice that didn't know any better that was a pre-arranged marriage actually it was a pre-arranged marriage but she just didn't know it so praise the lord but he comes and he makes sure that this is a bribe that's old enough to know what she's doing to accept the marriage proposal first he makes sure of that first and then what does he do he declares his love for her because without the declaration of his love for her this marriage will fall apart it will never last she will never be confident she will never be able to move forward she will have anxiety and depression and be sleeping in church and everything else she will fall apart she has to know this this has to be answered first because it doesn't matter how much that woman loves that man if he does not love her first it's not going to move forward so he comes and he answers the question this is god's pattern this isn't just some story by the seventh vile angel and choosing a bride this is god's pattern this is what god has done himself he has come and he says yes i love that girl yes i love that girl and brother brandon says but people get so confused because they can't understand if he loved me he would keep everything away from me and no trials no persecution no nothing like that he says no that's not god's love see it doesn't matter how much you feel god loves you what matters is a vindicated messenger standing here and telling you what matters is if hagia says the king loves you because haggai knows eliezer knows and he says that's not how god expresses his love to you is by building a hedge about you and keeping everything away from you he says he expresses his love to you by saying that he loves you and if he has said that he loves you he loves you period it is non-negotiable because he said i have chosen you and his why would he choose you if he did not love you why there's no logical explanation why would he choose you if he does not love you by default the very fact that he chose you proves that he loves you now the next question is well how do i know that he chose me look at the billions of people on the face of this earth look at the number the small minority of them who have even had the privilege to hear what you have heard let alone out of that small minority what other small minority has said yes that is the truth and i love that how is it possible for you to do that if he has not chosen you first it is impossible it is not possible it it cannot happen do not discount the pure simplicity of the receptiveness of the gospel of jesus christ indicating your your marriage to him indicating your relationship to him indicating that he did love you indicating that he has chosen you that is the very basis and way that he expresses his love to you see you if you want all the flowery fillings and cloud9 fillings and whatever else that's fine you know i want more of those but that is not what my relationship is based off of my relationship is based off the fact that i have a pure understanding a proper understanding as the prophet said that god himself has chosen me and he loves me even when i fail him every day he loves me and i know that he loves me is because he has came by my way and he has whispered his love secrets and he has expressed himself to me and there is no other reason that he would express himself to me if he did not love me it is that simple don't discount it don't get confused in your mind because when you get confused in your mind about whether he loves you or not you will automatically start operating in a in a realm of fear and then you fall back on your plan and your works program let me know how that works out for you it'll bring more anxiety more depression more xanax that's what that will lead to but if you can simply come before him with a clear conscience and a clear accept acceptance that he loves me because he has told me he loves me you say well i've never heard an audible voice that he came down and says i love you listen to a tape [Music] you want an audible voice there's your audible voice listen to a tape and when he comes and he says good evening friends and something of you goes tell me more that's him telling you that he loves you because it's impossible for you to have that reaction unless he first loved you and chose you it's impossible many people may try to fake it many people may get the intellectual conception of it but i'm talking about a true marriage i'm talking about a true love for that word that when it cuts when it comes and it cuts and it slices and it dices and it strips you down raw you'll still come back to it and say give me more tell me more tell me that you love me think not it's strange when you fall into these fiery trials as many as i love i rebuke and i chase him the proof of his love is election election to what election to reproduce the son of man again he says god's love was elective love the proof of his love was election that no matter what happened listen now listen no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation you say well i don't know if i'm chosen under salvation what is salvation saints it's the word you are saved by the word by by the word you are saved i'm going to try to think of other ways to say it but you you understand it's that simple salvation by the word and if god has chosen to bring his word by your way so that you could respond and and given you something that you could respond appropriately what does that by default mean he has elected you to salvation because he loves you son i want you to listen to what i'm about to say i got some questions to ask you do you love this woman yes i love her yes i love her see he had to answer the question first he had to answer the question first continuing very common but i'm going to read it just because i love to read it and i could preach it every time that i preach but he says the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval neither are they or the bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the be loved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us all yes but how shall we know we we shall know because he said so you say well i just can't make it that simple i've got to feel something i got to have a sign up you'll never it'll never work saints it'll never work if my wife discerned whether i loved her or not by my actions and by everything i said and did she would be extremely confused i would be confused but she has to have you're you're all his wife's the same i'm just saying me whatever they have to know at the end of the day he loves me because he said he loved me period whether he proves it or not now obviously if he does love you he'll prove that he loves you obviously if you love him you'll prove that you love him but christ loves you and the proof of that is because he said so if you cannot rest on that you were going to be a miserable person you were going to be up and down up and down shirts to church pillar to post doctrine to doctrine message to message whatever you are never going to be established never you have to have that understanding he loves me because he said so and manifested there's two parts to it and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself remember we're we're gentiles not jews brought us to himself what is himself the word the message that's why i have a problem when somebody tries to make the bible and the message two different things because i'm not a polygamist i did not marry two people i married him the word the message he manifested that he did love us for he brought himself to us and gave us of his spirit placing us as sons how do you know because he said so and he brought the message your way let it be as simple as it can be and don't even come to me with you don't know my past because i don't care about your past did he tell you he loved you and did he bring the message your way who am i to say you're not hiss who am i to try to put you in or out who is another minister to try to put you in and out does he love you and did he bring the message your way and do you love him did you love it when he passed by your way i don't care about your past i don't care about the mistakes i don't i don't care about the bad decisions but what i assure you is the devil does the devil does and he'll remind you about them every day because what's he want to do he wants to cause the marriage to fail because if the marriage fails there's no reproduction and if there's no reproduction he can be a squatter and if he can be a squatter he can just keep this running on and running on and running on and running on but if the marriage is true because there's a proper understanding that he does love me reproduction takes place and now your life will draw somebody else to him and there's reproduction that takes place and now that person's life will walk through walmart one day and somebody will go that's different in a good way and they say maybe i want to be like that there's something there's something drawing me to that or somebody will go to work one day and a conversation will come up and he will express himself and now that person says i kind of like that that sounds good tell me more and reproduction takes place and then eventually one day the last one will be reproduced and the squatter will get kicked out because he's no longer the accuser of the brother he has nothing to accuse he loses his position and we go live on a cloud happily ever after praise the lord but the devil don't want you to come into a marriage that's why he will tell you constantly that he doesn't love you because if he did love you you sure you certainly wouldn't have just did what you did let it be as simple as the angel made it because if you don't if you don't you better get by some xanax because you're going to need it you will be mentally and spiritually tore up the rest of your life you will never farther yourself in the gospel you will never father yourself into reproducing the son of man again so that the son of man can reproduce himself and somebody else again you will never come to the point of the marriage you have to allow it to be that simple he loves me because he said so and he manifested it by bringing himself the word the message by my way and i accepted it let it be that simple i'm going to go through some scriptures real quick don't try to turn you can just listen second thessalonians if i can find my place second thessalonians 3 13 but we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brethren be loved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth now read that verse with the proper understanding of what the prophet said this verse is the very indication and confirmation that he does love me because he chose me from the beginning through salvation sanctification of his spirit and belief of the truth if if you believe the truth god loves you sorry it took me a while to say that one as well don't let it be more complicated than what laodicea that's what laodicea wants it to be let it be as simple as he made it where until he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of the lord jesus christ therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which ye have been taught whether by word or by epistle now our lord jesus christ himself and god even our father which hath loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace comfort your hearts and establish you in every good word and work second peter 1 verse 10 there wherefore the rather brethren giving diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall same thing that i just said i was quoting peter and you didn't know it make your calling and election sure because if you do that you will never fall if you have a proper revelation that god truly loves you how are you going to fall you can't that's what peter's saying but peter is saying you better make that sure because if you don't you're going to fall for sow entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth first john 4 16 and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love verse 19 is the key we love him because he first loved us make that sure get a proper understanding of that and i assure you you will move forward in the marriage with no hiccups can i go a little farther i knew you would say yes that's why i asked that is then the first question that has to be answered by the male party the bridegroom do you love this girl because obviously if he tells brother branham no we're done here we're not moving forward with the wedding obviously if christ says no we're done you're not moving forward in a wedding there are people that that applies to jacob have i loved esau have i hated i'm not going to go down that avenue but just be thankful that you're jacob and not esau but if god declares his love for you that moves us to the next step because brother random turns to the lady and he says i said to her do you love him now this is the question this is the question we have to answer because he's already declared his love for us how he told us he loved us and he brought himself the word the message by our way he declared his love for us but he turns to her and he says do you love him she said yes sir i do john 14 15. if ye love me keep my commandments so if you don't keep his commandments also known as the word don't try to tell me you love him i'm not talking about mistakes bad decisions i'm talking about a desire from your heart of hearts to keep the word and anytime you don't you repent and line back up with the word that's what i'm talking about see that spirit comes right back in immediately after i just got spending 30 minutes talking about it it'll come right back saints and it'll come back here in five minutes and it'll come back when you walk out the doors and it'll come back out tuesday wednesday third it will always come back because he's the author of confusion and he knows if he can cause confusion there'll be no reproduction that's why brother brandon would tell the story about women that can't have babies he says go adopts it takes all the pressure off of them they're not confused they're just relaxed and then they conceive that's in the natural don't tell me the same thing don't apply to the spiritual if you will relax spiritually in your knowledge and revelation that he loves me reproduction can take place but if you never get past that there's not going to be any reproduction take place the son of man will never be demonstrated again if you love me keep my commandments what's his commandments acts 2 38 repent repent be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and ye shall receive him you shall receive the baptism of the holy spirit you shall receive the word for your day repent be baptized don't try to go into the marriage if you haven't repented or been baptized it's not going to work come god's provided way if ye love me keep my commandments you say well i do love him i've repented i've given my heart to him i've you know i've surrendered and okay have you taken his name in baptism well is that required if you love me you'll keep my commandments it really is that simple brother brandon says he gave three ordinances to the church when he left water baptism communion and foot washing you say well i've been baptized with that whole communion and foot washing things that's spiritual christ has come yes he did come spiritually but if you want to know whether it's still natural or not take off your shoes go kick your coffee table as hard as you can and then tell me how everything's spiritual it's not all spiritual it's not all spiritual there is a spiritual application absolutely but these are ordinances he left to the church until he comes naturally we will naturally meet him in the air but until then he says continue in these things until that time period water baptism communion and foot washing there's so many people trying to tell me that they're that they're going to the marriage supper of the lamb and they just want the marriage supper of the lamb and they won't even eat the marriage supper they land with the brother and sister they want to wash the feet of the bridegroom they want to wash the feet of the lamb they can't wait to get over there and worship him and wash his feet but they won't wash his feet getting ahead getting ahead getting ahead is there a spiritual application absolutely but don't go getting so spiritually minded you're no earthly good and don't go getting ahead of the timeline because until you can kick that coffee table and it doesn't hurt your foot you're still natural and you still need water baptism to be instituted into the church you still need communion naturally and you still need to take foot washing naturally that's god's ordinances when our atoms change then so be it but until then if you love me keep my commandments first john 2 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world what is his commandment don't love the things of the world if you love him you won't love the things of the world obviously we could spend hours talking about the things of the world and what you should and shouldn't love but i'll just say get in a relationship get in a relationship and remember what the point is the point is redemption the point is spiritual multiplication the point is to bring forth the son of man again when you dress yourself the point is to reproduce the son of man again when you're ruling your wife man the point is to reproduce the son of man again the point is not to wear the long skirt to say i wear a long skirt because the scripture says to wear the long skirt this the point is to reproduce the son of man again understand the point is to be the head of your house so that you don't make christ a wishy-washy man the point is to be the head of your house and to rule to govern to lead to god your wife as christ as the church so that christ is reproduced again so that somebody can see that who is a child of god and come to life that's the point the point is not to obey the rules for the sake of obeying the rules so that you don't go to hell that's good i don't want to go to hell either but that's not the point the point is to reproduce the son of man again a relationship a marriage not to be flirting with the world first john 4 20 if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother who he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen that's so simple i don't even think i need to expound on it but i want to continue now that excerpt i'm saying that correctly that i was reading in the church age book about god's love because he reads that paragraph he or he says that paragraph about god's love being elective and how that we know that he loves us but then he asks a question how shall i prove my love to him remember that's the portion that we're in now brother branham has asked this girl do you love him brother branham is asking the same question in the church age book coincidental i know how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy admits the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass it is so simple it's shocking but why do we have so many works program if we had a proper understanding of this why are we so bothered in our mind whether we're really in love with him if we're doing this let it be as simple as the prophet made it how shall i prove my love to him two things he only gives us two things why do we want to make it more than two believe what he said believe what he said believe first and foremost what he said about you and then worry about believing the other things but just believe what he said about you and conduct yourself with joy amongst the trials that he allows to come your way that's how you prove your love to him because if you don't conduct yourself with joy amongst the trials that means you think the trial has come by a power of somebody else but him you think this is something the devil can do the devil has done the devil was as brother and said is punishing me god is punishing me because of this bad decision that i made if he is he'll let you know you made a bad decision this is what's coming down the pipe grin and merit but don't spend each and every day wondering that every bad thing that comes your way if it's god punishing you what purpose does god have to punish his children if he doesn't tell them why he's punishing them his purpose is not to punish we've been through this we know this his purpose is not to punish his children because he enjoys it the purpose is reconciliation so it totally defeats god's purpose to allow a trial or a tribulation or something negative to come your way just because he felt like it no the purpose is either to bring correction and he'll tell you how to correct it or the purpose is to express himself through something count it all joy when you fall amongst diverse trials diverse temptations why because he loves me he said he loves me he brought his word my way and now i am entering such a point in this relationship that i can literally flesh out the son of man again in this situation that's the purpose how would god ever express himself thoroughly if everything that happened to a believer was good he can't and remember what is the point the point is to express himself so that we would know him to re to manifest himself through somebody with preeminence and to restore fallen eden this is the channel that he goes through that's why he says conduct yourself with joy amongst those because if you don't conduct yourself among with joy amongst the trials that he sees fit to bring your way what attraction are you going to have to somebody you're just going to be like the rest of the world a trial comes your way and you fall to pieces that's what the rest of the world does how is there going to be reproduction take place there can't be because you're just reproducing the world that's why he makes it that simple conduct yourself with joy amongst the trials that he sees fit to bring your way remember in the book of revelation who's setting on the throne and who's calling the shots you can touch this you can touch that you can do this you can do that oh by the way don't touch the oil in the wine remember who's calling the shots each and every day period the lamb is on the throne and if you are his he's calling the [Music] shots i'm going to do one more and then we'll close i promise he turns back to the man and he says now have you got a place to take her after you marry her he said yes sir i don't think i'm going to preach on that in the natural realm i'll just say that anybody that didn't i'm sure you realize that was a mistake there's a reason the scripture says he'll leave father and mother cleave to his wife and go on about their merry way two heads in the same house will not work it's not godly it'll never work and that's pretty much about all i'm going to say i'm sure anybody that's been there realizes that he says do you have a place to take her after you marry her remember this is a question for the bridegroom praise the lord let not your hearts be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me in my father's house there are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you so i go and prepare a place for you that's what christ did in his marriage don't think a natural marriage is going to bypass that if you don't have a place to take her you're out of the program you're out of the pattern it's not going to work if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also what are we talking about saints we're talking about the prerequisites to the marriage see there's things we have to meet and there's things he has to meet second corinthians 6 14 be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers as the musicians come for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what concord hath christ with baal i don't think i'm saying that right belial maybe or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are the temples of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them does he have some place to take us saints oh yes come out from among them and be you separate saith the lord what is this talking about why is he saying come out from among them because there's a marriage going to take place and he's got somewhere to take you come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty revelation 18 4 and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not her plagues revelations 4 1 after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven why is there a door opened in heaven because he's got someplace to take you he didn't leave you in the load of cnh he had some place to take you he didn't leave you in a condition of not needing nothing he had some place to take you to where you realized you need everything i have nothing a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither does he have some place to take you yes he's got some place to take you and brother branham says the scene changed from earthly things to heavenly things where does he want to take you to heavenly things through an open door out of a laodicean condition come up hither and i will show you these things which must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne why is he taking you to heavenly places so that you can see him sitting on the throne it's not a marble throne saints i will say this it's not just a marble throne there may be a marvel throne i don't know i'll tell you when i get there but the throne is your heart saints where does he want to take you to a position to where you can see the lamb is on the throne and he is the only one that i'm concerned about does he have some place to take you he's got some place to take us let us all stand i'm just going to have to stop because there's no ending point and i'm not going to get done and i'm going to run a wedding and then there will be no preamble to the wedding and i'll get fired and all that other good stuff so we're just going to stop but i want you to think as we just bow our heads together and our pastor would come i just want to think solemnly sincerely we claim we're the bride of jesus christ and no doubt we are we profess that we have went into an invisible union and no doubt we have the bridegroom has present it's undisputed we acknowledge that we recognize that he is here the revealed word we make these proclamations we we say and declare who we are in the position that we're in but does what we say and what we live does it meet the prerequisites to the marriage did we meet the prerequisite to actually be in the marriage or are we just saying we're in a marriage sincerely examine yourself we don't want to end up at the at the end of the road thinking that we had married christ when we really didn't because we weren't spiritually mature enough to be engaged into a marriage we didn't have our written permission of fulfilling and doing the portions of the word that he told us we were obligated to do before he married us we don't want to bypass that and think we're married when we haven't met the conditions we want to accept the fact that we are his and his beloved simply based on his statement that he has declared i love you i have brought myself my word by your way as a token to prove my love to you accept that for what it is accept the fact that we have to express our love back to him by obeying that word and by conducting ourself not as the rest of the world when trials and tribulations come but conducting ourselves with a steadfastness and an assurance and a settledness and with joy amongst the chaos and the trials that come our way with the proper revelation that the lamb is on the throne and he is in control of my life let us rest assuredly and have joy in knowing and know truly that he will not just desert me he's got someplace for me he has went and prepared a place for me he has prepared a a he has opened the door to the spiritual realm for me to come through there will be a natural house for me no doubt there will be when our atoms change but now he has prepared a place for us out of laodicea through an open door in heavenly places with christ jesus to recognize he is one on the throne of my life can we truly follow that pattern can we truly go through the filter of the word can we meet these prerequisites to the marriage that's to take place i pray that we can and i pray that we're not just saying something because it's a cliche or because it's what we think but we genuinely know where we stand you examine yourself as i examine myself because we want to make sure that at the end of this somebody can't come along and say no that was not a good marriage there was not conditions met that have to be met we don't want that we want to be sober we want to be grave we want to be steadfast in our belief let's pray together precious lord jesus lord we've been lengthy father i pray that you would bless the people for their attentiveness lord lord i pray that you would just take these things that were said that you would take them and apply them to each and every heart as they need to be applied may each one have received their portion here this morning you know the condition and the status of each of our relationships with you lord and i pray that you would just take this word that's been spoken in such simplicity by your prophet so simple breaking it down to where we would not miss it lord of what has to take place lord and i pray that you would allow us with a clear conscience and a sober mind to approach you and to examine ourselves so that we're not putting ourselves in a position that we have no right to but yet we would never back up on a position that you have put us in lord may we come your provided way may we not try to skip a step or skip a timing or put something ahead of where it should be but may we come resting in what you have done and what you have said in the timing and position that you have placed and when you have done that let us never back up on it lord let us call it for what it is let us say it how it is let us live it how it should be we thank you for this time we pray that your blessings would be upon the people as they would leave we pray your blessings upon the wedding today and that you would just guide and anoint all those that are involved and lord may it be one that would glorify you lord that you would have the preeminence in that you would reproduce yourself again we pray these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you let's sing brother john [Music] returning for resting on his wine have no earthly love that i'm holding to you're the one who means everything to me so i will see [Music] to you [Music] not one thing you said you had not done someday when i see you standing face to face and i know to you're the one who means everything to me i will see i will worship you i will give everything [Music] praise god my brother ben was preaching there i just kept thinking i'm so glad that god is not a flirter [Music] because if he was just flirtatious amen you'd wonder whether he really wanted you or they wanted to marry you or not but that's demeaning god's character if god has come to you and if god has begun to draw you to himself he's not a flirter he's announcing his intentions he's not playing with our emotions he's not showing the message just to take it away just so he can play a little emotional game with us but if god has drawn you he's declared his intention by the drawing sometimes people they they say oh god's called me and i don't know if god's called me and i know i'm the bride and i don't know i don't know if they're right amen you know what you're doing you're demeaning the character of the one who's drawing you turning him into a flirter but he's not a flirter he's got an intention he's got a heart purpose and his heart purpose before the foundation of the world will have a bride after his own choosing and he's not flirtatious friends if he's drawing you by this message if he's wooing you and luring him to himself he's stating what his intention is he loves you and he wants to marry you amen enjoyed the message today pray god bless our brother i got some extra notes for the wedding ceremony praise be to god what a good day for this service you know he was talking about the the types natural typing the spiritual and brother benham talking about the woman working and the provision and all of those things brother branham goes to a scripture i believe it's in isaiah he says in that day seven women will take a hold of one man and say give us thy name only will eat of our bread and wear our own garments brother said that's showing an end time condition the incoming condition he said is marriage and divorce but also where a woman does not want to come under the headship in total care of a man she just wants it to take away her reproach by being married give us your name but i'll work and provide for myself my own garments and my own bread that's why when brother ben's striking at that thing he's striking at it for a reason because those things are wrong in principle they are wrong in principle because it demonstrates in the natural the wrong thing in the spiritual because that's what has happened to the churches they want to be called christian but they want to take care of themselves they want to have their own way they don't want to submit fully amen in full submission and surrender to their headship and expect full care they still want to do their own thing so they don't have to have a full submission [Music] it's a form of rebellion spiritually self-sufficiency amen is a lack of confidence in a form of rebellion and that's why those things that's why brotherhood strikes against those things because they're fundamentally wrong in principle when you look at the principle behind the thing and we don't ever want to be that kind of church that's not what he had in his heart's purpose from before the foundation of the world but he's wooing a bride he's calling a bride that says i've got confidence in you i trust in you i'm comfortable with your leadership and i'm not going to do anything to take care of myself because you promised to take care of me you bear me on your shoulders that's the right approach that's the right attitude towards christ that's the bride that he's looking for in this day i said lord i'm not capable of taking care of myself i'm not capable of providing my own bread my own manna i'm not capable providing my own garment my own covering which is the word i need you for all of that so i surrender all to your headship to your leadership i'm not going to go around trying to provide my own protection covering and care and and demean your power and ability to take care of me but i'm going to surrender all to you it says in another church age friends this is the bright age he's looking for character amen god bless you as you're dismissed let's just sing that again brother john if you don't mind know the time the bride that you're returning for dressed in garments white wrinkle free have no earthly love that i'm holding to you're the one who needs everything [Music] hardly me your throne i will give anything i will give everything to you [Music] there's not one thing standing face to face my praise for you [Music] i will worship you i will bow myself i will give everything for you god bless you saints pray for us as we travel down for the wedding amen all those will be traveling back and forth and before we dismiss i want to say god bless you sister tanya it's good to see you here in the service we trust that god is bringing you to full strength and full health amen also way over here on the opposite end god bless you
