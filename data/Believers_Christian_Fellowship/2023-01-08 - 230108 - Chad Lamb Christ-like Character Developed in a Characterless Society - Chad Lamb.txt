enough had a little baby born little Marcus Ilya losing off amen so God God be praised for that but we don't have a picture to show you because little Marcus was just a little bit early and his lungs were not as developed as they like so he had to go to special care right away in the hospital there and yesterday they decided to transport him to Toledo Hospital so he's in the Toledo Hospital now so we want to pray for them I talked to Ilia today and they said Marcus is improving he's stable he's not in critical condition he's not in danger they just want to give him some oxygen because his lungs aren't as developed as they'd like but he said last night he improved through the night and he's they've reduced were able to reduce a little bit his oxygen level so we want to pray together that that God will give him strength to his lungs that'll absorb oxygen that he can go home I know all they want to do is get everybody home together amen so we're excited for the birth of little Marcus but we really would like to see them get home let's all stand together and I'd like to just pray together for little Marcus and for Ilya and Natasha it's a little bit difficult being separated dad trying to take care of the little kids and family helping and get up to be with Mom and Toledo so it's I'm sure a stressful time for them so it was an assembly we want to want to pray for them so let's bow our heads together their Heavenly Father Lord we thank you so much what a privilege it is Lord to see the dedication of a baby that you've given Lord to a couple in the assembly now we Rejoice with them over the over that birth and now the birth of little Marcus Lord and we're so excited for about the Ilion sister Natasha so happy for them and Lord the doctors are wanting to help little Marcus and his lungs need to develop a bit but God you have it all under control you know all things and there's nothing out of kilter with you and God we just pray that you would help him now that you would

together for your glory and may there be a tremendous testimony of what you've done for them as well we love you Lord we ask you blessings now in Jesus Christ's name amen and while you're standing let's turn to the Book of Revelation Nation chapter 3 and we'll begin there also we want to remember sister Tammy Mills at the loss of her father brother Robert Douglas amen we all know brother Robert really well he was a tremendous brother and so I'm sure they've got a lot of arrangements to make funeral arrangements and plans and it's a busy time and may God bless sister Tammy she helps her mother with all of that as we get the details we'll send those out and make them available also I almost forgot I want to say happy birthday to Brother Kyle God bless you Brother Kyle did you turn 50 this year or 51 something like that amen but uh I missed on Wednesday I missed brother Ben siebold so his birthday was Wednesday and I think Griffin shorts was too so I missed those so God bless you all happy birthday to you all amen we won't sing right now we'll sing to Kyle later amen but uh it's a good day it's a good day to be together we look at Revelation chapter 3 verse 14. thank you and unto the angel of the Church of the laodiceans right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knoweth not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that them may as be rich in white raiment the thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes have that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent amen God bless you as you have your seats I also want to say I appreciated the song special very much God bless you all and thank you for that amen as we look this scripture I want to I want to take for a title uh christ-like character developed in a characterless society was kind of wordy don't normally do that but it sounded good this time christ-like character developed in a characterless society and when we look at the laodicean church age this description of the laodicean church age we find out that that verse 17 he says because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing this is the condition that that the people believe that they're in this is their this is the the height of deception through the church ages has gotten to the the God of this evil age have so deceived the people and deceive their minds that they believe in this last age that they are rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing but God the way God views them he says know us thou not that thou art wretched and miserable poor blind and naked so they are wretched and miserable poor blind and naked but they are completely unaware of it they absolutely believe within themselves that they are rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing they don't know that they're spiritually needy they think they're sound now to me this is absolute deception in the laodicean church age that the church is absolutely completely deceived and so the and we find that the the whole age is is in this kind of deception the environment which we find ourselves in and that we live in is absolutely lost its mind and thinks it's intelligent the world has lost its mind Brothers said they would go completely insane but they wouldn't know it in fact that they would call evil good and good evil they would get into the time where everything is topsy-turvy where the things that they think are good are actually evil and the things that they call evil are things that are actually good they have the world has gone totally insane they have completely lost their minds but the deception the thing that's so deceiving in this age is that they think everything's fine that man is intelligent that we are we are we are moral that we have uh uh all kinds I mean it's it's so ludicrous that the same society that will kill unborn babies amen will fight for humanitarian rights so we're fighting for humanitarian rights but we're we're we're we're killing the right to become a human being to live and breathe uh uh and to be born into the world so we're fighting for humanitarian rights but refusing the most basic concept of humanity which is life so I mean this is the world that we live in they're absolutely lost their minds uh uh but but to challenge that or to say anything against it than the people who are challenging that are the ones who are ignorant and and I'll tell you right offhand I'm ignorant when it comes to the ways of the world when it comes to uh the philosophy of our modern day Society I'm absolutely ignorant I'm not schooled in and I don't understand it it doesn't make any sense to me amen but but the thing that I want to know is what the society not what Society thinks or the the social Norm I want to know what the word of God says because that's sanity that's reality that is the real reality everything else is absolutely absurd and the laodicean church age brother Ben says uh he says notice now the name laodicea is the people's rights are Justice of the people was there ever an age like the 20th century Church age that has seen all nations rise up and demand equality socially and financially I mean it's a it's an age of people's rights so I don't have to do that it's my right I can do this and I can do that but we know it's an age of total deception and this is an evil age so it's the the whole concept of people's rights is absolutely contrary to the whole idea of the Bible because the whole concept of the Bible is people who will give up their rights and surrender themselves to God so the whole concept is a yielding to the word of God Amen but the whole the whole design of laodicea the whole concept of this last day is for people to take their own rights over the word of God to not have to obey to not have to listen to be able to do their own thing and so let's go look at Luke chapter 9. I'm just going slow to set a foundation for for what we want to look at Luke chapter 9. let's begin in Luke 9 verse 23. and he said to them all If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save him for what is a man an advantage if he gain the whole world and lose himself or be Cast Away so we see Jesus is telling us that any man will come after me let him deny himself this is the opposite of laodicean rhetoric this is a complete the The Words of Christ are absolutely contrary to the modern era and the thinking of the modern day let him deny himself and take up his cross daily I love this I love this passage this is repeated similarly in other gospels but I love it here because it says take up his cross daily and follow me this is not a one-time decision we made one time long ago but this is a daily taking up a cross amen and what is the cross used for the cross is used for sacrifice it is used for uh uh death it's a it's an instrument of punishment to slay somebody on so the whole idea of bearing a cross is that you die on the cross amen that you're nailed to the cross and this is the place of death amen so now to to Die daily to take your cross to deny yourself and take your cross daily means to die to self and stay in that condition of dying to self and denying self amen and then then follow him so he says if you will save your life you shall lose it but if you will lose your life for my sake the same shall save it amen so now we find that that the whole concept is contrary to laodicea for the the Apostle Paul said in First Corinthians I Die daily so he caught this concept that he had to Die daily and the message forsaking all the problems said what else did Jesus do he gave and forsook his own life he gave his life to save yours and mine because that he gave his life he didn't have to lay it down he'd done it willingly he didn't have to do it but he done it willingly because he could save you now this whole point is just setting up the setting in the face of what Jesus did the example that he set for us was absolutely contrary to laodicea he brother remember said he didn't have to die that way he could have continued living as a man he could have married and he could have raised children but he he willingly surrendered to the word of God and to the will of God and gave himself a sacrifice for you and I so Jesus set the standard by example how we should live now laodicea is painting a completely contrary picture to that picture that Christ said amen but he gave us the example how we should live and Christ is the mystery of God revealed he says but when Christ is identified in you identifying himself then you are christ-like so we are not like the world but we are christ-like so we look at what Christ did and we do the same thing you're a christ-like which the word Christian means to be christ-like there is your identification all right now and since he is our identification then we should be identified with him by living for him so now he's our identification that's our identification to be Christian to be christ-like to be like Christ so what was Christ like amen he was self-sacrificing he he submitted himself to the will of the father in all ways and we are supposed to be christ-like not laodicean-like either but it's that simple we know that I know we know that amen I I I'm not trying to bring anything new what I'm trying to do is get us in the right frame of mind to live in the world we live in because every other message we pick up outside of this word gives us a totally different picture and because we live in that atmosphere I mean we live in an atmosphere where employers cannot fire their employees we live in an atmosphere I mean when I worked it was absolutely amazing the people I worked with they would get so angry and so upset every time the boss gave a requirement I need you guys to start filling out this form here's an extra piece of paper we got to fill out I want you to start taking pictures of repairs and then people would blow up and why I don't have to do this and and I'm saying he's paying you he's he's giving you money and you agreed that I if you give me money I'll do what you say I'll work for you why are you so angry it's not like he knocked on your door and said hey you come here and you no you went to him and asked for a job and you you get the paycheck every whatever pay period is and and he's the boss he's the one with the money he's the one who's doing the paying he's the one who gets to make up the rules but laodicey is so pervasive that mentality that you have employers who blow up every time there's another request made and re they refuse to do it I'm not doing that and if you work in a union shop it's a thousand times worse why because this is the laodicean mentality we all know that but the the problem is this mentality Creeps in and it's all around us and it can creep into our families and our homes it can creep in it can creep into churches it can creep in and all of a sudden we don't realize amen that I'm not the boss I don't make up the rules God's the boss he makes up the rules it's his word it's not my idea it's his idea and what I want to do is be christ-like it means whatever the word is I'm subject to that so that's our identification let's look at Ephesians chapter 3. Ephesians chapter 3. verse 1. Ephesians 3 and 1 for this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you gentiles brother man talks about this how Paul called himself a prisoner of Jesus Christ and we know that that Paul was a voluntary prisoner of Jesus Christ and you can argue and say no you know no he wasn't he was he was held captive by the Romans Hey listen it was voluntary for one his attitude was he was a love slave he was a prisoner to Jesus Christ and his entire imprisonment was based on his free choice amen in the message of prisoner he says now you could hardly imagine Paul regarding himself a prisoner a Born Free Man filled with the Holy Spirit but yet he calls himself a prisoner this whole approach and this whole attitude Paul had he was a prisoner of the Lord Jesus Christ he was subject he was a love slave Bound by chains of love to Christ and and he was and he confesses Paul confesses Amen to the to the governor that he was Freeborn and he says and and I think it was the Centurion maybe I don't remember who said how were you born I obtained this at a great Psalm he says I Was Born Free so in the in the as a Roman citizen he was born free and there he had certain rights that gave him certain rights but Paul was willing to give up those rights to serve Christ it wasn't now about being a Roman citizen it wasn't any more about being a Jew he gave it all up and he counted his Heritage and all of his accomplishment as done that he might win Christ because he was a prisoner of Jesus Christ not by force but willingly he he there was brother remember said he was bound in Chains of Love chains of Love are invisible chains there was no physical circumstance by which God held him he wasn't held by social constraints sometimes I wonder how many people are prisoners of Jesus Christ because all their family or their spouse or their parents believe a certain way so they believe a certain way and they're held by chains of social constraints they're held by chains of human love they're held by chains of the the the social Gathering that they gather in amen but those chains will break they're not tough enough to hold under every circumstance but chains of Love true love to Christ in a voluntary enslavement and and this is I mean he's a prisoner with no bars he's a prisoner with no cell he's a prisoner with no lock and no key amen he's the best kind of prisoner anybody could ever have amen because he's a prisoner that will never Escape he doesn't want to escape he's a prisoner who's not going to flee when you leave the door you don't need a door he's there because he wants to be there so it's he's a willing prisoner of Jesus Christ by his own desire let's go to First Corinthians 9. First Corinthians 9 and 24. First Corinthians 9 and 24 know you not the day which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the Mastery is tempered in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we an incorruptable i therefore so run not as uncertain so fight I not as one that beat at the air but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Castaway the so when you when you look at the scripture nobody nobody had to check on Paul nobody he didn't need a buddy system to be a believer he didn't need an accountability partner to get him through Paul because he recognized I'm running for a prize I I there's something to be gained there's something there's a goal that I have I want to live for Christ I want to win Christ and live for Christ amen all of those things are his motivation he's not motivated by peer pressure he's not motivated uh we used to say it like this he's not motivated by domineering personalities he's not dumb dumb he's not dominated by harsh hard preaching he's not dominated by a strict sector or a strict guideline that's enforced by a group of people what's holding what's holding Paul what's holding him through stonings what's holding him through beatings what's holding him through rejection what's holding him when his friends leave him what's holding him when Barnabas separates when Demas leaves what's holding him so fast to the word amen it's his own love and his own desire and his own willingness to surrender and it's a stronger Bond than any other bond that has ever been on the face of the Earth is Paul willing to endure such difficulties but never give up have him face such rejection and hardship but never throw in the towel never quit being a Believer never Paul listen Paul went through so much but you never saw Paul take a break from church because he was hurt or wounded or rejected or he never took a break from God and just kind of just kind of took a break from this Christian Life for just no for him it wasn't that kind of a thing amen it was the desire of his heart I mean it was his whole life it was everything he wanted and he willfully surrendered himself to it and bound himself in Chains of love he wasn't looking for separation he was looking to give all he wasn't looking for it easier he was looking for the he was looking for a way to serve God with all of his life what an example to us I I want to live that way and so now I I want to uh dive into where I'm really wanting to go there's been a quote that I've read or I've quoted off the top of my head the last few services but I wanted to take time and go through it we'll get to that just in a minute but first I want to read a quote out of the church age book from the latest in church age but there is a gold of God First Peter 1 7 says the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth the gold of God is a christ-like character produced in the fiery furnace of affliction that is the right kind of gold but what kind of gold does the church have today it has but the worldly gold that will perish it is Rich it is complacent it has made affluence the major Criterion of spirituality the evidence of God's blessing and the correctness of Doctrine Etc is now based upon how many Rich folks are involved in it you had better come you you had better come before it's too late saith the Lord and buy of me gold tried in the fire and then you will be truly rich are you getting it listen to me naked physically we came into the world but naked spiritually we will not leave it oh no we are going to take something with us and what that something is is all we can take with us nothing less nothing more so we had better be real careful now to see that we take something that will make us right before God so then what will we take with us we will take our character brother that is what we will take with us now what kind of character will you take with you will it be the little to be like his whose character was molded by suffering in the fiery furnace of Affliction or will it be the softness of this characterless laodicean people it is up to each one of us for in that day every man will bear his own burden so what kind of character we have will it be the character that's like the world or will it be the character that's like his that's molded in the fiery furnace of affliction and and I want to look at that fiery furnace of Affliction the way our character is molded in just a minute so hold on to that term but again in the church age from the thyart iron Church age section he says the word for burden is weight or pressure the pressure of the Dark Ages was either Bend or be broken so in the Dark Ages there was a totally different environment than the one we live in now would you agree they're about polar opposite in the Dark Ages it was under the constraints of the Jezebel spirit she had come to complete power ruling over Nations and kings and and and so now you either bow to the Catholic system or you died there was a real pressure there in the Dark Ages and you know what character was manifested a true character was manifested in that circumstance because there was no options amen there was no hiding there was no pretending amen there weren't a lot of pretend Believers in that day when you were giving your life when families were being separated when your children were being taken from you all for believing the word amen there was not a lot of pretend Christians in that day and those who who were true Christians their character was developed and also displayed because of the environment that they were in it was an environment conducive to character it's for the displaying character see so the the pressure was Bend or be broken bow or die it was the Inquisition the power of the Empire backing up satanic worship be organized or pay with your life each age had its pressures for example a great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches and soft-living we live in a different time the great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions and a complex age that that was that we seem unfit to live in that's the trial and this the the burden of the last day is the pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions and a complex age that we seem unfit to live in I feel unfit to live in this complex age as a human being I mean not not as a child of God I was born for this age but just on a human perspective things are moving at such a pace I don't think Humanity in general as a human beings with the natural genetic human being with a brain and eyes and hearing and senses of touch and hear I don't think they were meant to live in this kind of environment they're getting stressed out to the max amen we have people that are are with all kinds of anxiety issues there are all kinds of depression anxiety clinical critical mental illnesses you have people who are in depression amen and and they haven't ever missed a meal they don't have any major death in their family there's no major illness around them but they're absolutely depressed good jobs making good money living in good houses driving good cars and they're completely depressed you have people with severe anxiety and worry amen and there's nothing wrong there's absolutely nothing wrong in life but what it is is our brains are being short-circuited by all the information and the environment and everything that's going on around us amen everybody is on sensory overload and the and the hardware is crashing so the burden of this last age is the nervous tension but also the pressure of riches you see the pressure of riches yeah it doesn't take long when you've been blessed and you have blessed and financial blessings in your life it doesn't take long till you realize I don't know how much stuff owns me or how much I own stuff because everything requires upkeep maintenance it requires and then it requires protection amen you buy it then you buy an insurance policy so you can't lose it then you lock it up so it doesn't get stolen you have insurance in case it gets wrecked and then you have to do all the maintenance and the tires and the and the wiper blades and the battery and the blah blah blah and then I don't want this investment to get ruined so I got to build a garage and I can park it in the garage and you know what it was simpler to have nothing so there's a pressure of soft living a pressure of riches and it doesn't take long till we become slaves to materials to material Goods then we then we work to keep the things going so we work to gather the things then we work to keep the things going I say oh it'll be a glad day when we get free from this system but this is where God planted us and it's here in this age of soft living in this characterless layout to see an age it's here that he wants us to develop christ-like character it's in the epitome of Easy Living and pleasure-ridden Madness and and self-serving every agenda is self-serving in the midst of selfishness and self-love and and self-glorification and self-pacification it's in that environment that he wants us to have christ-like character not in the Dark Ages when You Face Down the B system and it's either live or die no it's now we're in a completely different area where now you can have anything you want and you can live any way you want and it's in this atmosphere he wants to mold a christ-like character in US amen so there's a burden of pressures of riches soft-living and nervous tension so but he says that the character is molded uh we'll look at this way uh this previous quote his character whose character was molded by suffering in the fiery furnace of affliction you start thinking you know what is the fiery furnace of Affliction they're not arresting me and Hauling me out of my house for believing the message I've not been refused employment because I'm a Christian not yet and so but when we look down through time let's just take Paul for instance Paul if he would have remained as he was Paul had life I mean he had a good life he had he had uh made some achievements he was respected he was educated he was part of the system and he was such a part of the system that he had at least a voice with the high priest they knew who he was and they gave him letters to Damascus to go to go hold him so he had confidence of the religious leaders he was a a Freeborn I mean in the society he lived in he had the best of everything he was a binge of mind he was a Pharisee he was in good with the religious leaders but he was also a Roman citizen like he was the best of both sides he was a Roman citizen which gave him certain rights and he was in good with the the priesthood and he was a student of gamalia so he got certain rights there and he had rights here and he had rights here and he had privileges there and he had proof he had everything kind of going for him so what were where was he going to get molded christ-like character where was his fiery furnace of Affliction it came when in spite of all of that and without him having to he chose to take the word and leave all of that behind and when he chose to take the word then Affliction began then rejection began then then all of this stuff friends moving away and accusations and and stonings all of it started when he of his own will amen chose to follow the word to follow Christ and leave everything else and he entered into the fiery furnace of Affliction voluntarily I mean he could have got out of it I mean you think if he didn't go back to the Jews one day and say listen I listen Sanhedrin I apologize I found out I thought this was right I found out it's wrong amen I want to come back to the good side do you think for a second they would have taken him back willingly forgiven all false amen maybe even promoted him Beyond where he was absolutely at any time Paul could have stopped his affliction but he was a love slave he was bound by chains of love so Paul willingly stayed in the pressure in the rejection in the hardship of his own choosing and there that christ-like character was not only developed but it was displayed so how am I going to gain character and display character and the soft living in laodicea you just take the word and the word above everything else and I promise you there'll be affliction there's we've already experienced Affliction and rejection from families rejection from Friends amen when when we when we rejected where we were when we were raised up I was raised up as a Pentecostal boy in an independent Pentecostal Church on one side my parents were divorced one side was that way the other side was through the Pentecostal denomination and and raised all that way but brother when I took the word amen all of a sudden the rejection and the questions and all of that started to come where are we going to meet resistance only by taking the word let's look at Hebrews chapter 11. and I'd like to say in them environment and atmosphere we live in I believe with all my heart it's going to get worse that for in some ways because of laws of religious liberty and political correctness we've had rejections sure we've had people get angry at us we've had people say some horrible things about us and to us we've had family members who reject we've had friends who were separated with we've had all kinds of these difficulties but but it's going to get worse because we can either choose to go with soft living and laodicea or we can choose to take the word and those choices are going to come I think uh more blatantly I should say it that way because I mean we're going to have to face if you're an employer if you have a small business or you're even an employer that worked for a large business and you're in charge of hiring you are going to face issues and lines that you can't cross amen it's already that's already in MO movement it's already in motion and we're going to face some of these things there there are there are all kinds of laws and all kinds of ideas floating around that are trying to be put into law that it's going to cause us to come face to face amen with will we take the word or will we stay where it's comfortable but I believe as a people the bride I know what the bride will do she'll take the word she will take the word and in taking the word she will be entering into more affliction but more Affliction brings more character and more pressure brings out more of the Life of Christ so let's look at Hebrews 11 and verse 23. by faith Moses when he was born was hit three months at his parents of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith Moses when he was coming to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward if you think about what all Moses went through the rejection the the wandering on the backside of the desert the the all the things that he went through before he came back to be a deliverer then after that but you realize that Moses that he did that voluntarily Moses could have stayed in Pharaoh's house he could have stayed right there he had the opportunity to stay planted in Pharaoh's house and get all the Privileges that come from being the son of Pharaoh's daughter whatever that would entitle maybe the next Pharaoh certainly great riches and fame and wealth and power and all the things that are there but he chose willingly the reproach of Christ he chose the word over the luxury he chose the word and what did it get him amen it got him run out of Egypt on the back side of the desert married to a hot tempered wife keeping his father-in-law's flock I mean this it's almost like you know it it put him under trial it put him in difficulty amen but that's exactly where Moses needed to be he was being rung out on the backside of the desert he was being perfected and how did he get there by choosing the word and choosing the word brought him into that condition and when he kept choosing the word it kept getting harder the trials got more difficult it got harder Amen in the hole it's no surprise that Moses was placed where he was there's such an example where Moses was and then when Moses chose because what we were born into amen was a world a society a a culture where things can be so easy we can actually relax if you just wanted if you just wanted to have a family and you wanted to take some vacations and you want to work a job and you want to have a decent home and you want everything to go right you can do that in the society we live in if that's your greatest goal in life if that's all you want out of life you can do that and you can have some good times and you can enjoy some of the better things in life you can get some good food and sleep in a comfortable bed and it's all there and it's all available and men and and all I'd say almost 100 percent of us have that so where is our testing going to come from where is our Affliction going to come from where is our christ-like character going to be molded it's when we say I can't do that that's wrong when we say I won't go that way anymore when we say I cannot associate with this any longer that's when our Trials come that's when difficulties come brother remember said in the message the God of this evil age said now notice closely now as we study the word the God of this this evil age that we're now living may seem strange a very strange thing in this age of Grace when God is taking a people for his namesake that he that is his bride and this evil age that he should be called the age of evil the very age God is calling a people for his namesake by Grace out and his calling and is called an evil age now we'll prove by the Bible that this is the age that he was speaking of very strange thing to think that that in the evil age like this that God then would be calling his bride we find now that this this evil age is to prove to Satan she is not like Eve that she is not that type of woman and she will be Tried by his word the Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by the word and Adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise that he is the same yesterday today and forever today see but failed on One Promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and now the people that's called for his name of course is his bride she used to come in contact Again by the same thing not by just denominational truth or something but every word for in the beginning of the Bible man was given the word of God to live by one word misinterpreted by a man called Satan and a person of an animal called The Serpent Satan and this person could talk to Eve and misinterpret the word to her and was lost see it must be every word so brother bam I've quoted this the last couple of times we ministered but he said why why does God let it get to be an evil age and the age he would call his bride out and when you look at the evil age we live in it I think the most evil thing about this age is the deception it is so wicked is such a wicked evil age amen but mankind walks around feeling good about himself amen the culture Society they walk around feeling good like with like we're good people and we're good and we're doing evil wicked things all across the board amen marrying and divorcing and adulteries and and all kinds of fornication going on everywhere rampant amen destroying lives before they're born I mean all kinds of terrible things are going on but we feel good about ourselves because we donated a couple cans of soup in the dropbox at work and I rescued a dog and but everywhere around us is absolute wickedness I mean absolutely Wicked everywhere you turn every billboard every magazine everything you could listen to or turn on it's absolutely Wicked contrary to the word of God is evil I mean the the the the marriage and divorce the the the the the uh whatever I mean I you could I could go on and on and on the nudity the immorality the it is absolutely Wicked everywhere but we live in and the people who feel like good people this is the evil age we live in evil and then when you speak about it when you share something with somebody that it's not right if you simply would say it's not right for you to marry that woman she has a living husband my goodness they turn on you with teeth like you're Wicked and you're unloving and you're hateful and you're strict and you're you're you're a religious bigot we've had those circumstances we faced them we've had those conversations we know exactly what happens the same person who goes to church and sings I love you I love you you just give them the word on and they turn around and they call you everything why it's an evil Age full of deception and why would he let this age get so evil and the day that he's going to call out his bride amen we we would change it I mean to a Euphoria of God's word and call out a bride but God doesn't do things that way because God loves to prove himself he loves to show who's who so he brings the bride and he brings the bride age in a day where you and I could have everything we wanted and if we just want to live in peace amen all we got to do is keep our mouth shut and not and agree with everything that's said but you have to absolutely swallow down every god-given conviction in every matter of right and wrong in the word in order to do that but no we telling you it's going to creep closer and closer until you can't keep quiet any longer because the question is going to be put to you amen let's look at Genesis chapter 3. Genesis chapter 3. verse 1. now why did God let this be an evil age he said I'll quote it again we find now this evil age is to prove to Satan she is not like Eve she is not that type of woman and she will be Tried by his word the bride is Adam's bride was Tried by the word and Adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise that he is the same yesterday today and forever I love how brother Branham said that because it's really interesting all confused but one word all but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever I love how he said that because when you go to Genesis it's not an issue of yesterday today and forever it's an issue of whether or not you're supposed to eat of this tree but you see it's the same issue that he's the same yesterday today and forever so let's read verse one now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yay yay hath God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die now this is the contradiction but brother Branham said that she failed on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever so we're going to tie that together you shall not surely die for God doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a treat to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat so here the the woman fell and we want to look at what what is it the devil did because now this evil age is to prove to Satan she's not like Eve she won't do what Eve did so that's the test that we're coming to the test that we're coming to is the same one that Eve faced when she faced it face to face we're coming through the same thing and it and and it's not going to be a repeated scenario with the same words but it's the same thing and the the serpent began to convince Eve that God didn't really mean that that you're not surely die that it doesn't mean that you're really going to die or that or it also means that God's not really going to judge according to his word now if you just think about the environment we live in nobody out there really believes that God really meant what he said in his Bible what he said about marriage and divorce what he said about adultery what he said about morality what he said about hey let's just see what he said about water baptism in Jesus name or what he said about women not cutting their hair or what he said about you take any of those and you just take those subjects and you just throw them out there and you realize they do not believe that he meant what he said and they do not believe that he'll judge based on that and that's exactly what the serpent convinced Eve he convinced Eve that he didn't really mean that and he's not going to judge he's not going to judge you so that you can you can divorce that woman and remarry another you can take another man's wife you can do all these things and God's not going to judge that because because he loves you well that's the very reason he will judge it because love is corrective so the the world the religious world let's just say the religious world is convinced that God didn't really mean what he said in the Bible and those they'll argue that up and down but you go try to present to them what he said about women not preaching they don't believe it women not taking leadership positions in the church they don't believe it it's clear as a bell in the Bible amen but they they won't they won't take it about a woman uh not cutting her hair having long hair they won't take it about a woman being subject to her husband they won't take it absolutely won't take it why because Generations ago there was a lie that crept in and that lie came on the on the heels of the women's Liberation movement and they begin to Quant equality for a woman and a woman is just as good as a man and and all of this other nonsense and what it was it looked like it was a way to fight oppression but really what it was was an evil agenda of Satan to get people to deny the word of God because that kind that line of thinking is absolutely contrary to the word of God God made them male and female god separated the Sexes God attached certain responsibilities to each one and to deny that is to deny the word but it was laid an innocency at the beginning that we just she needed some equal rights and she was being oppressed and started with you know she needs the right to vote then there was apparel changes she began to wear that which pertained to a man and it crept in so suddenly Amen in this evil age that that the women were given you know equal rights because they're just as good as a man and I I deny that right because in some ways they're better than a man if I was a woman I wouldn't settle for being equal to a man I tell you a woman is so much better at having a baby than a man there's a world of difference see how ludicrous the world is absolutely insane there's things a woman can do that a man can not ever do there are things that a man can do that a woman cannot ever do so the whole premise for equality which has been sown throughout the world it is now the normal thinking to think contrary to that is now abnormal to teach our children contrary to that is now considered to be damaging it's considered you say no way brother Chad it's considered by many Educators psychologists to be damaging so the whole lie this is a lie I'm not I'm not here to preach against the women's Liberation movement but just to show in a simple example that people will believe a lie contrary to the word of God but that lie has consequences and the consequences was Mother entering the workforce and leaving the babies at home alone the consequences was people be able to decide how they wanted to live not subject to what God Said anymore and then women would become more masculine because they begin to operate with men and they have to change their behavior so you have a whole effect of women becoming more dominant more masculine because they're competing in a men's World and they have to become more rigid they lose that softness they lose that gentleness that Gentle Spirit in order to be able to work in a corporate world or a business world because she wants to be equal to the man she wants to join the military she wants to be in Special Forces she wants to fly an Apache helicopter instead of being a mother so but there's consequences because then another generation comes up that they can decide how they want to act they can decide how they want to dress now it doesn't matter what gender I'm born if I if if I want to get a man's job and act like a man and dress like a man and talk like a man and walk like a man it's my choice until then they're now permitted to choose their own gender I was reading a a scientific paper a study paper from like a scientific journal I was reading it recently and they were using the terminology what were they using how did they phrase this now I might get it wrong they were calling it birth gender birth gender because in a scientific paper they have to identify male and female if they separate subjects there's certain things if they're going to test it they have to know if they're male and female because they're not the same there's testosterone levels of estrogen levels there's a lot of things they have to know how something's working so they have to identify whether this is male or female but they can't offend the world so they came up with a new new way for scientists to determine what they're studying and now this is your birth gender it's not your gender it's your birth gender because you can decide to change your gender whenever you want and and it's absolutely ludicrous when we first started hearing about this I don't know I don't even know when to put a date when it became uh mainstream in conversation maybe 10 years ago 15 years ago eight years ago I don't know but at first it was laughable that they were gonna now allow children now the the modern thinking is don't identify your child amen with gender pronouns or don't identify them with he or she or wait till they develop and they determine what they want to be and it was so ludicrous but it's becoming more mainstream it's becoming a normal way of thinking till now it is so odd that scientists who know better have to use terminology like birth gender not I mean can you imagine them coming into the study group okay like I know you're a man I'm sorry ma'am I'm not I mean sir I'm not calling you but what when you came out of the womb what were you and I'm sorry I have to ask that because I know that's not what you want to be how did we get here we rejected the Bible and something as simple as the roles of a man and a woman all the way back I started I think in the uh after the turn of the century that started moving its way up and you started saying how did we get to this place where where parents are being uh uh uh um educated to not Define what their children are and gender to let the children Define for themselves what they're how do we get here how do we get to the place that Preschool teachers now are being taught to be careful don't use gender-specific terminologies about these kids because they haven't yet decided what they are where how did we get here I'll tell you how we got here we left the word of God we left it in what looked like Simplicity like there won't be consequences for just letting a woman enter the workforce there won't be consequences for letting her put on a Peril that pertains to a man but I'm telling you every time we leave the word there's long reaching serious consequences what does it matter if I wear a path what does it matter if I if I want to be a firefighter what does it matter if I want to do these things what matters is God gave you your position God determined how you will be born God set the rules and what's happening is the God of this evil age is corrupting your mind so wickedly that you think you can decide contrary to God's decision and that God don't care he don't really mean that and he won't judge [Music] David and they've gone from there to now children aren't deciding their gender they're deciding their species they're deciding whether they're a dog or a cat and they're requesting here in Lima they're requesting school boards to put litter boxes in schools because children identify as a dog or a cat and they want to use a litter box in the restroom instead of the facilities and we can laugh at that but those poor kids it's funny when you hear about it because it's so odd but it's not funny when you think about it and you say well those those get listen who told them they could do that it's you mom who decided you didn't want to be a woman you wanted to be a man it's you dad who wanted to be effeminate and turn over the headship to Mom and let her run while you go and play and golf and act like a kid that's whose fault it is it's the fault of the religious leaders decades ago they wouldn't stand up and say this isn't right A man is a man as a woman as a woman God gave them roles to play and you play your role and quit trying to switch and all because Satan Got This Modern Age to think God doesn't really mean that and he won't really judge but when you've got kids demanding litter boxes I'm telling you the judgment is here this is the Judgment this is the consequences for those actions and so why would God call a bride out of this evil age why because he's going to prove to Satan she's not like Eve that there's going to be a bride here when the whole world has gone this thinking there's going to be a bride that still says I'm glad to be identified as a woman because God made me a woman I'm glad to say I want a gentle feminine spirit because that's what God wants me to have there's a man who says I am glad to be a man and I will take responsibility like a man according to the word of God because I am happy to be what God made me to be I will dress like a man I will talk like a man I will walk like a man because God made me one and women say I will dress like a woman when when in the face of this evil age amen when when nobody thinks you're normal when nobody thinks it's right I don't say nobody you might have had somebody think it's right I'm talking Society in general thinks it's ludicrous think it's archaic think it's old-fashioned but since when did the Eternal Word become old-fashioned Eternal means it's forever it can't become old it's just as current today as it ever was that mentality of God that mindset of God that he expressed in word it's just as true today as it has ever been so we're seeing the judgment what is the judgment Generations now have come and gone in this evil age until now it's so wicked people have so blaspheme God that that they want to deny their human and be called a cat or a dog talk about mocking a creator talk about an evil age I don't know I've not read all of her all of history all the history books that are out there but I have never heard of anything like this there's been bad times before there's been Wicked generations and wicked Nations and wicked ages but I have never heard of anything like this and now I mean I was I was driving through Michigan and as I was driving through Michigan it's like every third billboard is a marijuana billboard it's shocking and because because it got so expensive to fight drugs drug abuse drug dealing drug use costs the state of Michigan millions of dollars Amen in incarcerations and court systems and and fees and all those things so now what they did is now they decided it's no longer immoral to use drugs now it's moral is that right because that's what happens when you elect officials you let them decide what's moral for a nation so now it's moral to have abortions now it's moral to abuse drugs and because it's now moral now businesses have sprung up seeming like everywhere if you count the number of billboards I mean it must be a pretty good business and now they get the tax money off of it so now changing the morality has taken from spending millions of dollars to gaining millions of dollars for the state of Michigan see how did we get here how did we get here the morality is changing and the laws are changing with the thinking of people and now it used to be wrong but now it's right well I tell you in God's eyes if it was ever wrong it's still wrong so why is God have us here in this evil age because there's going to be somebody that will stand with the word regardless of the climate regardless of whether or not they lose privileges or not amen regardless of whether or not they lose a good paying job they lose a good salary they lose a a an association they lose entrance into some Society or club or Clan and now it no longer matters to them there's a people here that'll stand like Paul and count it all is done that they might win Christ brother Brown goes on to say and the God of this evil age same message so then the world seems to be in the most evil age that it ever was never in any age did women ever act like that never but just before the destruction of the antiluvian world and Jesus referred to it we'll get to that after a while here's the question this is what I've been pondering on for weeks has God lost control or is he just permitting another agency to control like God doesn't know what's going on in the school systems like God doesn't know what's going on in society God knows has he lost control I'd say he's never lost control or is he just permitting another agency to control listen we can we can get as mad as we want at the government as mad as we wanted the world we can shake our fists at governments and blah blah blah blah blah but God has permitted another agency to control there's a God of this evil age that's controlling and God has allowed it so you can get so irate and angry about the government if you go on that political thing you're absolutely wasting your breath wasting your breath stay with the word just if we're going to promote anything promote the word that's why I I get so discouraged as a as a Believer when I see Believers pick up on a political party and bumper stickers and signs and stuff like that my goodness let's if I'm going to spend any time talking to anybody about everything it's not going to be about my candidate for president it's going to be about the word of God because it's just a futile effort this world is destined for destruction America cannot rise again she failed to turn at her turning point in 1956 and now she cannot write raise again and now it God has permitted another agency to control and now it's time for us not to fight the government not to fight the systems they're going to continue to get worse but it's to stand and the face of it all and whenever given the opportunity to stand for the word I can't do that because the Bible says I can't do that because the Bible says I won't do that because the word of God says that's what we're here for to prove to Satan that we do believe he is the same yesterday today and forever if it was wrong yesterday it's wrong today it'll be wrong forever that God's not changing his mind about his word it doesn't matter how far along the culture goes amen I'm not moving with the culture I'm staying with the word and just because everybody else says it's right doesn't make it right amen years ago we talked about the progression of immorality and the denominational church because the denominational system as long as they're not as bad as the world feel okay they're right so you look at the churches whatever they were 50 years ago is a drastic difference of what they are now there are some denominations that would not allow their women to wear pants just a hundred years ago some of the denominations now that will permit same-sex marriage wouldn't let their women wear pants or earrings or makeup and in a hundred years they've gone from not allowing the women Amen to dress like a man wear makeup or excessive jewelry and to now they'll marry two women together at their altar and there can be a lesbian or a homosexual priest that will perform the wedding how did they get there because they didn't believe God was the same yesterday today and forever they failed by the same thing he failed by hey she knew what the word was but she was made to believe that that word no longer counts in this situation and and it doesn't mean exactly like that for this and God won't judge and that's exactly what happened to the church but the problem is Amen in the message many message Believers have followed soon so as long as when the world goes here as long as the denomination church is back here and they say we're better than this standard then we're okay some of the message jerks have been following the denominations and as long as we're not as bad as the denomination we're okay but I said God help us not to fall into this trap I don't want to be a few degrees better than wrong I want to be right with the word of God if the prophet of God told us how to dress that's how we dress the prophet of God told us how we conduct ourselves how we deal with one another how we live in the public how we whatever I mean we can we can go through all kinds of details but you get the point if the prophet of God taught it if the word of God is explicit on something that's still good today it was good amen it was good in 1969 it's still good in 2023. we shouldn't be changing with the times now of course you know as soon as I say that people of course we change with the times I mean we now stream we didn't do that we now use technology that wasn't available and you know our style of clothing changes don't say it doesn't it doesn't go get a picture from your go give me an old photo album but the amount of clothes we wear shouldn't change the amount of skin that's covered how loose or tight fitting it is some Styles might change some colors might change but the morality shouldn't change the concept shouldn't change the point's not changing and so we have to we have to be a people that'll stay with the word and not get duped into the God of this evil age coming and telling us well that doesn't really matter God is looking at our heart but the prophet told us what's in your heart manifest them what's outside it we can make all kinds of excuses there's all kinds I mean we could go through days of all the things that we've heard and all the excuses that are made but that's not the point the point is it has to go this way so that somebody will prove she's not like Eve you can get upset we can get upset we can you can point to other places you can point to other people in the assembly from point to other families you can point to one another we can point all over and say that's wrong that's wrong they're going this way and how could they do that we can point all day long to one another the point's not the point it's to recognize that these things have to go this way to prove she's not like Eve there will be a bride who will say as for me and my house we will serve the Lord so as God lost control or is he just permitting another agency to control I wonder the true answer to this question is to my opinion there's two opposing spirits in the world today at work now there can't be no more than two two heads and one of them is the holy spirit at work the other one is the spirit of the devil and in the last days in deception now I'm going to base my thoughts right on here for the rest of the text the two Spirits one of them God's holy spirit the other one the devil Spirit working in deception the people of the Earth are now making their choice the holy spirit is here calling out a bride for Christ he is doing it by vindicating his Word of Promise to her for this age showing that it is Christ if the finger is supposed to move in this age the finger will move if the foot is supposed to move in this age the foot will move if the eye is to see in this age that I will see the spirit of God as it's growed into the full stature of God is the age that we're now living in the holy spirit is here vindicating the message of the hour and the Holy Spirit is doing this so that the people that believe God will be called out of this chaos it's grown into the full stature of God what is it's growed it's growed out of the church ages and has come back to defeat the legs and the arms and come back to the eyes but now by the difference that we're in the intelligence the very mind of Christ the word has been open what is it it's supposed to be Christ on full display all that he ever was and all that he ever will be is supposed to be alive and a body of Believers on the earth in this evil age and I don't think Christ I don't think Christ anybody believers is compromising on the word is changing as the social mentality changes I think it's staying true let's go to Daniel chapter one Daniel chapter one foreign verse 8. but Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat nor at the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself we know the story quite well Daniel and his three friends were among those that were taken captive when Nebuchadnezzar took Judah captive they took some of the princes some of the children of the royal family and took them back to his Palace and they were going to educate them to be wise in them and Daniel and three of his friends they made the cut and they were taken because they were part of the the right family of the royal seed and they were taken out of Judah and they were goodly children and they were taken and presented to the The Keeper of the eunuchs and they were placed under his care and the King prescribed the best Meats the best this and that but those meats were offered to Idols contrary to the to the law of Moses and so Daniel was far from home and he didn't have his parents watching and he didn't have any priesthood around I just love this where was Daniel he was smack dabbing the evil age and and Daniel was under a bit of pressure because Daniel was taken from home from his culture his Society where what he believed was normal and he was taken to where what he believes is abnormal not accepted or respected and in that environment he's told that they're going to they were going to make him a position in the government they're training him uh to flourish in this new air this new era in this new location that he'll be a man of prestige a man of Honor uh uh uh somebody a wise man in counsel with the King so there's a lot of pressure on him but what I love about Daniel is it didn't matter where he was and it didn't matter who he was around and it didn't matter what was normal there amen he remembered the god of Moses he remembered the law he remembered what God Said and he we purposed in his heart not to vile and defiled himself with the king's me regardless of the consequences he's captive in a foreign land who knows he could be killed he could be imprisoned he could be he could just be kicked out on the street I don't know what would happen to him but there was potential consequences for his actions but the consequences didn't matter the pressure from the King didn't matter and what everybody else around him thought didn't matter What mattered to Daniel is he was going to keep the word of God you want a lesson for us and the Bible calls him a child how old he was we can only guess but I don't even think he was yet a young man so he's he's here as a child maybe a young teenager somewhere in there give or take a few years and he is already determining in his heart not to defile himself what the king's meat without a mother or father giving him counsel without a priest giving him counsel but out of his own heart he's going to love God what did Daniel do he just made himself a prisoner of God and he just set himself up for potential affliction we find later in Daniel's life if you go to chapter six with me if you're still in the Book of Daniel chapter 6 verse 10. it says now chapter 6 verse 10 now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed what is what writing they were trying to stop Daniel because they were jealous of him so they the the other presidents they they got together with uh the king of that day and and got him to sign a decree that if anybody prayed to any other God but himself for a period of time that they would be cast into the lion's den and Daniel knew it he knew what they had done he knew it was signed into law and it says now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being opened in his chamber toward Jerusalem he kneeled down upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God as he did a four time the changing of the law didn't change God's law the changing of culture the changing of society the changing of politics didn't change the word of God and Daniel still knelt and prayed as he always did to his god with his window open to Jerusalem because he still wants the blessing that was in Solomon's Prayer because he believed the word of God this is a man who is a very high-ranking official now in the government and and he everybody was jealous of him because of that and that's what got him into trouble was their jealousy amen but it didn't matter to him if he lost his position if you got thrown in the Lion's Den all of that was inconsequential because What mattered to him most was to keep the word to stay true to God what did Daniel do we find him as an old man we've saw him there as a child refusing the king's meat but now as an old man we find him still Shackled In Chains of love and bound as a love slave imprisoner to God you know Moses gave up the riches of Egypt Paul gave up his position in the religious order of the day and under the Roman government but if you look at years later after what they gave up after Moses gave up Egypt Egypt was destroyed after Paul gave up the Jewish religion amen the the Jerusalem was destroyed so they could have kept what was temporal or they could have moved to what was eternal and both of them moved to what was eternal and years later they find where they came of is under absolute destruction and ruination and I say everything in this world is headed for a burnout uh your the jobs our houses our cars our achievements everything in this world is headed for Destruction amen it doesn't matter it doesn't matter that you've worked at that company 30 years amen once they once they change the order and you can no longer be a Christian and stay there it's time to leave I mean a lot of stuff goes on that we're not involved in I mean you think about all the uh how many books are incorrect at all these businesses they keep coming out one after another after another they've been keeping false books amen that's not your fault you have no idea what they're doing it's not your decision it's not your consequence but when they come to you and say you now have to do this what are we going to do you now have to do this you now have no option I'll say you know what everything in this life is headed for a destruction but I want to stay like Moses did like Daniel did like David did with that that will not fail that will not fall away we have an eternal Kingdom coming I don't want to hold on to what's temporal fearing I'll lose what's going to burn anyways but help me God to hold on to what will last forever he says in Christ is revealed in his own word he says down through the age we started off from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went in the ground the complete seed then it came out through the feet Luther came back out through Wesley then to Pentecostals the tongues and the lips see now it's in the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth and now there's nothing else for it to to come but him himself to step into that because that's the last thing there is him himself to step into what to step into his bride the next is the intelligence and we have no intelligence of our own it's his we have no side of our own how can a man foresee these things he can't do it it's God himself it's becoming to a place and he's governing the body all the way through then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adam did at the beginning like Adams was rather at the beginning so the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride and she is here in this evil age so what is she here for I think she's here to manifest the word despite it all in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed it says his presence in the individual with a personal Vindication of himself expressing himself The Living Word that's promised for the day expressing itself through you a Vindication of the great revelation of God what is it Christ in you the hope of glory that's what this age is set up for to display that that's why it's so wicked that's why it's so evil that's why we now have to face it I I mean we used to talk about it over there but the world has got so corrupt now it comes right into our extended families we have to face it we have to deal with it we have to talk about things we even have to reject certain ideas we can't just we can't just let it go now it's coming home it's coming right around us it's getting closer and closer all the time what what is God doing in this day he's vindicating himself in her and look he says look only in an individual never a group an individual not a group his identification is with an individual you get that not with the method it's not with the Baptist not the Presbyterian not the Lutheran not the Pentecostals but as an individual I'll take one and leave one I'll separate them there'll be two in the field I'll take one leave one they'll be two in bed I'll take one leave one it's not a group it's a personal Vindication of a pregnated child of God filled with the Holy Ghost so surrendered to God that he don't care about anything else and the Holy Spirit living its life pulsating through him showing the personal personal Vindication of the word itself expressing itself to the people and to the world why are we here in this evil days why is it that your sisters walk down the road or walked through a shopping center and you're the only one dressed like a lady why so that he can manifest himself why is it that when you go to a restaurant and sit down you're the only family that's sitting there bowing their heads and praying for a meal and talking to one another everybody else if there's four people at the table there's four phones on the table what are we here to do manifest the word of God manifest when when we just do the most simple and basic of things when we know who we are in our roles as a father and a mother and children when we show mutual respect for one another when we dress right when we act right when we speak right when we refuse to do and say and take part in the things that are contrary to the word of God it's beginning more and more to stand out in such contrast that it becomes a lit up billboard everywhere you go why did God put us in this evil age so that he can vindicate himself this isn't the time anymore where everybody was moral and everybody was a moral Christian everybody's still a Christian but under the deception they're no longer moral Christians why because God wants to display himself not to hide but to show he says this is what he says in the message Investments he said I said in the message if Beethoven was in you you would do the works of Beethoven you would live the life of Beethoven you couldn't do anything nothing else you could do nothing else but compose songs and you'd be the great writer Beethoven because he's in you that's who you would be you would be a reincarnate Beethoven if the spirit of Beethoven was in you you would you would write songs and if Christ is in you the Life of Christ you will be the lover of the word nothing can stand and take the place of the word because he is the word he can't deny his own word and remain God that's why we're in this evil age it's because he'll not deny his own word and he's got a people who won't deny his word praise God there's been a time especially in this nation because this nation is so religious that we can continue on as we are and and be kind of left alone I don't know that it's always going to be like that I don't know for how long I don't know it may always be like that I don't know I'm not predicting the future I don't know the future but even if it doesn't it doesn't mean we're going to change our stance on the word brother Benham said they're gonna shut the doors to this church and one's like it he says that in many many places what will they shut the door for I don't know maybe because there's things we can't accept maybe there's things we refuse to participate in or refuse to join with I don't know exactly how everything will look but I'm telling you when I don't think God wants us to to just blend in I think he created he he permitted an evil spirit to create an evil age so there's no more blending in when everybody thinks there's a Christian there's got to be a display of what a real Christian is so we let everything get so dark so that a little light can shine bright and when it gets dark as far as lack of truth even a little candle in a pitch black room puts off a great deal of light and this world is getting darker and darker amen and we're becoming brighter and brighter because of the darkness all around us it gives us an opportunity Amen to share with others what it is that's different about us amen so it's Christ it's not us it's Christ what forms he in he's in a bride form what is Christ Christ is the word so it's not us it's the word in us living his own word creating a contrast you can say I hate this world I live in has anybody ever say that why is it so bad I'm disgusted by what I see but yet God knew it would be this way and he placed you here anyways you and I are here to serve God's purpose I want to read this one last quote so let's listen to this together and his character was that he did everything that pleased God and he stayed with the word that's his character the character of Jesus Christ is he did everything that pleased God and stayed with the word that's what he wanted us for we'd stay with God's word and find our place and then know where we stay where we're at stay with his word and think of it we are invited to shape our own character to his now we're going to find out what we've we've done shape our character to his own by his own Spirit then we be it by him our sons of God just what I've expressed by having his mind in us to shape our character to his mind let the mind that was in Christ be in you if that mind is in you then you see he only did that which pleased God he knowed who he was he he came the Son of God he knowed he was to take the place his character had to be that way and then when he having had having taken his place he knowed what the Messiah was required of and he always sought to God to do those things and did nothing until the father showed him now if you find your place sister don't let me hurt you or brother but you'll find your place in the word as a Christian not what the Creed said that's down here in the lower cannon fodder that's going to be destroyed see you find your place as a Christian because your character is molded as Christ you are Zoe the same as he was Zoe then if the Bible said for a woman not to cut her hair how can you do it it says man is the ruler of his house how can you be how can you woman be what's the matter with you man that's sons of God see you don't find your place you're invited to come and take his character by having his character in you it molds you into the same mind that he was and his mind was always to do what the father had ordained him to do so if we have his mind if we're going to be like Christ to be like Christ means that we surrender to the word what did Christ do we're going to do the works of Christ what are the works of Christ he says I did nothing unless the father shows me he only did that which God said do so we can make it all kinds of other things if we do the works of Christ it'll look like this and it'll look like this and we'll have this manifestation but when it comes down to really the core of it all what does it mean to do what Christ did and have christ-like character it means to do whatever the word says do it's that simple he said search the scriptures they testify me in other words if you don't do exactly what the scripture said I'm to do then show me where now what if God stood on the platform today today and said what's required of a Christian then where would we be see the character isn't expressing itself so it's in this atmosphere that the character Christ expresses itself his mind was to stay with the father's word the their mind was the the same mind that was in them was in to be in us and if his mind is in us we'd do like he did if his character is in us will be as he was all the prophets had that we know he took we took take about Noah now he didn't this day Moses what he did in his day Daniel and his day the Hebrew children and so forth the word molds God's character to us and anything that's tried to be mixed with that character breaks the mold so what is this evil day for to show that she's not like Eve that she won't be confused on all but one word that he's the same yesterday today and forever and that God does not change his mind concerning his word in the Book of Esther I just want to share this with you as we close we've been through it so we won't take time to go into it but in the Book of Esther we know Esther was called for a certain time she went to the king's Palace when all the fair young virgins were chosen but she wasn't like the rest of the fair and young virgins there was something different about Esther and what was different about Esther is she was humble and meek and she was submissive and it says in Esther 220 I'm just going to read it to you quickly it says Esther had not yet showed her Kindred nor her people this was after she became Queen she had still not yet showed her Kindred or a people as Mordecai had charged her for Esther did the Commandment of Mordecai like as when she was brought up with him we saw Daniel and his friends away from home somewhere else still keeping the word we saw Paul keeping the word Moses keeping the word we've seen them all keeping the word but here's Esther with that same kind of character that even now she's a queen she's been put in the House of vashti Amen Mordecai can't even get to her and do anything to her there's no punishment going to come there's no rebuke even going to come but now she's so submissive and humble she's still doing exactly what Mordecai told her just like when she was in his house this is the kind of character I want where if I'm all by myself in a wrong thought comes in I'll say God forgive me I reject that thought in the name of Jesus Christ not because of what others think or what others see or because of a group standard I want to do what I do out of a pure motive to serve God because his word says and I want to be true to the word that is true Christianity it says and Esther earlier in the Book of Esther when Esther went to go to the king to present herself to the king every young Maiden can take anything she wanted you remember we've been through this you could take anything she wanted whatever she wanted she could take with her but it says Esther required nothing but what haggy I had appointed what was different about Esther she was submissive and what is different about this bride brother Ben said there's been churches churches and Brides brides but there's got to come one what's going to be different about this one this one no matter what will stay with the word that's what will be done different with this one brother Benham said he said we are his victory the church is his victory when God can get preeminence in a body of Believers and his live his life through the bride that's his victory and the reason of his death that God is has allowed a release of an evil spirit to work he's allowed another Spirit to work because when he can get preeminence and a body of Believers in Satan's Eden that's his victory and the reason of his death and I want him to have his victory in me and let's all stand musicians if you'll come brother memes goes on to say at the finishing of this quote down here in Christ as the mystery of God revealed he said notice the Vindicated word in his body is his victory and the reason of his death why are we living in such a dark age because we're supposed to shine a bright light does it disgust us absolutely but I'm not going to scream about it being disgusting anymore because it has to be this way it's we I've heard of things in the last few years that I never dreamed of hearing hearing of activities people and things that they do things that are allowed what school systems allow and what they teach and it's just been the last five years it feels like the whole world has lost its mind the way that they're what they're doing with Children what they're doing with schools what what they're doing in science it feels like the whole world has lost its mind but I say the environment is just exactly right for what God wants he wants to display himself in Bride form so I'm not going to let the condition of the world discourage me but I want the condition of the world to encourage me that it's time to rise and shine for thy light has come it's time to stay with the word regardless of whatever circumstances and what everybody thinks about it but it's time just to stay with the word humble ourselves be simple amen no matter where we find ourselves at work I want to be just like I was in Mordecai's house in the in the chamber separated in the palace at work on vacation by myself I don't want to change my standard when I change my environment and change my company I want I want it to be Christ in me 24 7. and in order to do that Chad Lamb's got to die in order for him to have preeminence then I've got to I've got to take up my cross daily and follow after him I've got to die to reputation I have to die to familiar love I have to die to all kinds of things in order to stay true to this and I said God help me die I want to read one last scripture Colossians 3 I'll read you don't take your Bibles but I'll read Colossians 3 verse 1. if ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God set your affection on things above not on things on the Earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ and God when you hear the next report of something else going crazy in the world just remember my affections are not set on anything down here but they're set on the things that are above and this is not my kingdom the kingdom I'm part of is coming next but I'm I'm planted here for a purpose God help me to live that purpose and let's bow our heads together Lord Jesus we thank you God we thank you that this evil age cannot overcome your Eternal purpose God you said there'll be a bride in the end time that will not fall like he fell because she's predestinated not to God we have no idea what may transpire in the next few years months days weeks we don't know we have no idea but what we've seen in the last five years has been shocking God I pray that you'd help us to stay true to this word no matter how much society and culture loses its mind help us to receive your mind and stay true to your word God I pray to give each one of us courage Lord that we might make ourselves Your Love slaves Lord Jesus I want to be bound by chains of love I want to declare myself your prisoner God I don't want you to have to use rules and a heavy hand and chains and irons and bars to keep me in God I want my love to you to be Bond enough to keep me true to you help me God help me die to myself and help me to serve you regardless of where the world goes and regardless of where my friends go regardless of where my family goes help me to stay true to you God I pray that you would give us more of yourself reveal your mind to us change us o God by Your Word and help us to stay true to that word I love you father I pledge myself fresh to you again pray to forgive me for my failures of the past where I let you down where I failed but God I pray you would help me in the future that I could stay surrendered to you that you could have preeminence in me God shine your light through this vessel in this day in Jesus Christ's name we pray God bless you friends [Music] [Music] [Music] the less it means to to foreign [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] us I really want to see for the more I see of this old world the Blessed means to me for it's Jesus I really want [Music] oh I thank God there's been a door open in heaven so when the world gets dark we can look up and be caught up and see us something that's completely different than what we see around us if you look back through the Bible there's to me two kinds of testings two kinds of Trials I'm sure there's more if you look at that but just for the sake of the this morning there's those things that happen to people that try them and press them and get the character out of them there's things that happen of no fault of their own they just happen and the same thing true in our lives but so many times in the Bible there's things that happen to people because of choices they made to follow God and they'd make the choice and they follow God then the pressure comes then the squeeze comes down then the trial begins and I think the same thing is true in our life there's many things that happen to us not because of a decision necessarily made but there's trials that come in testings that God allows things that happen but there's also those things where we choose to take the word and the face of opposition and then the squeeze comes down and the pressure comes and what does it do it manifests the character it forms character and manifests character so many in the Bible we could talk about so many characters they knew going this decision going this route it's going to cause all kinds of backlash but they win anyways [Music] I want to stand when that gets out ten thousands of my friends will leave me thinking I was saying that about myself but he said it anyways he went preaching in in California he said I come preaching as hard I can as hard as I can up and down the coast of California about bombed hair women and every year it's worse and you say well why are you preaching for them preacher he says somebody's got to say it and what did it cause him it caused him rejection that very preaching against the conduct and attitude and dress and then morality of women caused him to get pushed out of the businessman's fellowship but he never shut up on it it causes Rejection it caused problems but because it was the word of God and he was responsible for preaching the word of God he said it anyhow I'm so glad we had a prophet like that in this age but more than a prophet being like that I want to be a daddy like that and a husband like that I want to be a co-worker and a friend and a family I want it it may hurt it may be rejection but I want to thank my stand for Christ because it will benefit somebody I do not want to be a chameleon and change color in every environment but I want to be a sea Gene of almighty God manifesting the Life of Christ everywhere also means I don't want to walk into a room and start cursing Bob there I mean that's not what I mean I'm not talking about going and creating trouble for no reason so many things that we have to face and we have to deal with that's trouble enough if we take the word and everything we'll have our own squeeze we'll have our own little squeezes we've had them in the past we'll have them and again but what will it do it'll bring the fragrance of Christ out of our lives that's what the Bible looks like that's what our lives look like when it's all over regardless of what everybody on Earth thought about me what everybody thought maybe he's a little too this or he's too that or a religious fanatic but there's one that I really care about what he thinks about me and that's the one who I've given my heart to in my life to and that's the one who I'm Bound by chains of love to and I want to remain his prisoner but remember I'm a prisoner by my choice and I'm a prisoner without bars God's not forcing me I can make the other decision I can do something else and I can still be a Son of God Amen but I choose to stay imprisoned to Christ the word help us call if God bless you as we go I love you all thank you for bearing with me as I shared my heart God bless you brother it's Jesus I really want to see for it Jesus I really want to see well the more I see of this world [Music] see my father knows what I [Music] need my father knows in everything I go [Music] my father knows what I like oh he's got it all foreign [Music] [Music] way down in my soul [Music] he's got it all oh I put my life now I put my life I put my life so every road I want I know is [Music] I put my life oh my father know my father knows what I mean my father knows what I mean in everything I go through he knows what's best my father know s why oh he's got it all one more time got it all in control he's got it all in it put that reassurance way down in [Music] anybody [Music] [Music] shallow for your soul [Music] you shall glorify [Music] oh yes you shall love the Lord with all your heart shadow foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] with all my heart with all my soul is you shall love the Lord with all your heart [Music] with all your soul you shallow before we fall asleep for all the things [Music] with all my heart with all my soul with all eyes
