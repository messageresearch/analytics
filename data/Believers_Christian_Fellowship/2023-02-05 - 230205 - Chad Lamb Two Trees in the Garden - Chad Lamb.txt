========================================

because he's predestinated a bride not to be deceived in this day then what has he done to to make sure that she will not be deceived remember the Holy Spirit you say will receive the spirit but the Holy Spirit was bound in these denominational Waters for nearly 2 000 years but is loosed again in the evening time by the evening time message the holy goes back in the people so what was holding the Holy Ghost what was barring or are locking or or chaining the Holy Ghost away from the people it was Creeds and dogmas it was the church systems and so what released the full measure of the Holy Ghost to come it was the full opening of the word because the spirit and the word or the self same thing it's the life of the word it's the spirit that makes the word live so when the word was released the spirit was released so what was holding the spirit it was when denominations were holding back the word and then holding back the word they held back the spirit so when God said when God the prophet says to us that God will have a bride shall not be deceived like evil she's predestinated not to be then you can say well I'm predestinated not to be God didn't just say you're predestinated not to be you're going to be fine but what God did is he released the word which released the life to ensure that you would not be deceived it's not that you can just say well I can't be deceived brother you can be absolutely deceived by your own self with that attitude that's a wrong attitude you're taking it on the statement like the statement is the only thing that God provided to keep you from deception no the statement shows that God's going to do something in this day that's going to prevent deception of the bride and what's he going to do is give his word back to his bride so that the wall is rebuilt and she by her own free moral agency can stay behind the wall [Applause] I mean we have you have people who will take a statement like that and act like they can say do believe anything they want to believe because I'm bride and I can't be deceived that is absolutely the wrong approach to God wrong approach to the word wrong approach to that promise that's like a Jew when Christ was here saying we're God's chosen people he'll never forsake us what you're saying was true they were God's chosen people and he wasn't going to forsake them they forsook him but the promise created the wrong attitude and we have a promise in this day but don't let the promise create the wrong attitude you can't feed on the things of the world we can't just willy-nilly accept anything everybody preaches and anything that's ever said and said well I'm bride I can't be deceived no God's brought an inoculation against deception and that's the revelation of his word in this hour in in the word came in fullness bringing the fullness of the spirit to make the word live to prevent the bride from deception
