[0:00] as a husband let's say I don't know what
[0:03] to do
[0:04] as a father I don't know what to do so
[0:08] what am I going to do
[0:10] I'm going to apply the token
[0:13] to that office
[0:16] and I'm going to say Lord there's more
[0:19] than me here
[0:21] I may not know what to do but you know
[0:24] what to do so I'm going to apply the
[0:28] Life of Christ the life the token to
[0:30] that office and you watch things happen
[0:34] you your children may be in a place
[0:36] where you don't know what to do with
[0:38] them but if you apply the token to that
[0:41] office it's like God stepping into that
[0:44] office where all things are possible
[0:47] nothing is impossible for him and he
[0:50] simply does what you can't do
[0:56] it's a token life
[0:58] is the token must be applied
[1:03] it must be applied in every office
[1:08] that we hold
[1:10] and through the application of the token
[1:17] things happen
[1:20] things that you didn't think would
[1:23] happen happen
[1:26] Peter was expecting the same results
[1:32] he was expecting Lord we've see it all
[1:35] night
[1:36] we've dropped this Net 10 times we've
[1:39] dropped this net we're tired that I mean
[1:41] we've washed the Nets we've we're done
[1:44] for the day there's no fish here Lord I
[1:46] know what I'm doing
[1:48] but at Thy word Lord I'll apply the word
[1:51] to this oh I'll do what you want me to
[1:54] do I'll do what you're telling me to do
[1:56] he was expecting the same results but lo
[1:59] and behold he got different results
[2:03] because sometimes we don't even know
[2:05] what result we need
[2:09] we don't even know what the answer
[2:11] should be
[2:12] so how how can we expect an answer when
[2:15] we don't know what the answer is
[2:18] we don't have a clue we don't know Lord
[2:21] I don't know what to do many times as a
[2:25] pastor you come to that place where he
[2:26] said Lord I don't know what to do I
[2:30] don't know what the answer is
[2:34] amen but we apply the token and the
[2:38] answer comes
[2:41] God brings the solution
[2:44] amen apply applying the token
[2:49] applying the token
[2:52] people that they'll they'll cut there is
[2:54] a time and now is whether that
[2:57] Supernatural element like in rahab's
[3:00] house
[3:01] it doesn't mean that that's at the end
[3:03] time houses have fallen
[3:07] to the curse of this world already
[3:11] look down your street
[3:14] and tell me how many are still standing
[3:20] I don't mean in a physical way I mean in
[3:22] a spiritual way they've Fallen to the
[3:25] spirits of this world but for some
[3:28] reason on your street there's this one
[3:31] particular house that hasn't fallen
[3:35] why is that it's because there's a
[3:38] supernatural element to that house the
[3:41] supernatural element is in this house
[3:43] and it's not in that house but it's
[3:45] God's grace that the Supernatural is a
[3:48] part of your home
[3:49] [Music]
