[4:19] oh lord jesus we thank you for the
[4:21] privilege of gathering once again
[4:24] god as we've come lord to gather
[4:26] together and sing the songs of your
[4:28] praises
[4:29] god we pray that you would abide in the
[4:31] praises of your people lord
[4:33] god for we want to welcome you lord we
[4:35] want to give you first place and all we
[4:38] say and do that you might be glorified
[4:40] and honored
[4:41] in all we do
[4:43] god we come to your word now and we ask
[4:45] god that you would help us in the
[4:47] breaking of the bread
[4:48] that you would feed us lord and that we
[4:50] could take that portion that we have
[4:51] neither
[4:53] strengthen us lord by your word give us
[4:55] eyesight to see and give us strength for
[4:57] this journey
[4:58] for we love you lord may you always have
[5:00] preeminence among us may always find
[5:02] welcome in our midst for we welcome you
[5:05] now
[5:06] in jesus christ's name we pray
[5:08] amen
[5:10] and god bless you while we're standing
[5:11] let's turn to the book of galatians
[5:15] galatians chapter four
[5:17] we're going to continue on with the seed
[5:19] of promise this will be part three
[5:21] in that series and i just keep titling
[5:24] at that because i don't know what else
[5:24] to title it so that works for me the
[5:27] seed of promise part three and i just
[5:28] want to keep sharing with some of the
[5:30] things that we've been sharing they've
[5:32] been really really good i've been
[5:34] enjoying them very much i've been
[5:35] enjoying looking at these things again
[5:37] and so we want to spend some time there
[5:40] by the will of the lord
[5:41] galatians chapter 4
[5:45] and
[5:46] verse 28.
[5:50] now we brethren as isaac was
[5:52] are the children of promise
[5:55] praise be to god let's go back to
[5:57] galatians chapter 3.
[6:03] verse 16
[6:04] now to abraham and his seed where the
[6:06] promise is made
[6:08] he saith not and to seeds as of many but
[6:10] as of one and to thy seed
[6:13] which is christ
[6:15] verse 28
[6:17] there is there is neither jew nor greek
[6:20] there is neither bond nor free there is
[6:22] neither male nor female for you are all
[6:24] one in christ jesus and if you be christ
[6:27] then you
[6:28] then are ye abraham's seed and heirs
[6:32] according to the promise amen god bless
[6:34] you you can have your seats
[6:36] so the thing that we don't ever want to
[6:37] forget is the first scripture we read
[6:39] that we brethren as isaac were are the
[6:42] children of promise because the the
[6:44] promise that was given to abraham was
[6:46] for abraham and his seed for his
[6:49] children and we are children of promise
[6:51] amen the children of promise so we don't
[6:54] ever want to forget that
[6:56] and i want to start by reading this
[6:58] quote we've been reading each time out
[7:00] of christ is the mystery of god revealed
[7:02] it says now you see the seals when he
[7:04] was in his mediator work back there
[7:07] redeeming but someday he comes forth to
[7:09] get this book that he's redeemed and all
[7:11] that's in this book would be him for
[7:13] that's the believer the words in the
[7:16] book and the word is him
[7:18] and all that's in that he came forth for
[7:21] this book of redemption whose names are
[7:23] written on the book before the
[7:24] foundation of the world when he was
[7:26] slain
[7:27] as a lamb
[7:28] so all that's in the book would be him
[7:31] amen and when we talk about the lamb's
[7:33] book of life and especially the section
[7:35] of the book of life which is the record
[7:37] of eternal life we're speaking of the
[7:39] very life of christ coming down through
[7:42] amen god's own life as it would be made
[7:44] manifest in each age the word of god the
[7:46] thought of god becoming the word of god
[7:48] the word of god becoming manifest in
[7:50] that day would be christ in each day
[7:54] so all that's in the book would be him
[7:57] for that's the believer the words in the
[7:59] book so the book is his record that's
[8:02] why it's the lamb's book of life or the
[8:04] book of life of the lamb amen
[8:07] because it's his life coming down
[8:09] through amen so god had this in his
[8:12] thinking before the foundation of the
[8:14] world
[8:15] amen so god knew amen that he was going
[8:18] to display himself god had a plan and he
[8:20] had a desire and that desire was to be
[8:23] known and that desire was to be
[8:25] expressed and so for in order for god to
[8:27] be expressed he had a plan a way in
[8:29] which that he would express himself amen
[8:32] by bringing portions of himself down
[8:34] through time amen because the word is
[8:37] god so when god brings the word that's a
[8:39] portion of himself
[8:42] and when that word amen is made manifest
[8:45] amen in a day in a season that is christ
[8:50] are we seeing it amen this is what the
[8:53] prophet of god taught us amen we can't
[8:55] go back to old denominational thinking
[8:57] because that's where you get trinity uh
[8:59] doctrines and where you get all kinds of
[9:01] confusion amen because we go back to
[9:03] denominational thinking but when we come
[9:05] really what the prophet taught us he
[9:07] brought us back to the mind of god amen
[9:09] and in the mind of god was thoughts amen
[9:11] when thought and when those thoughts
[9:12] would come forth to expression it was
[9:14] word when that word would be made
[9:16] manifest in its season that's christ
[9:21] praise be to god you say well that's
[9:22] simple that is profound amen that's
[9:25] profoundly simple that explains the
[9:27] entire bible and explains the message to
[9:29] us amen so when we understand that we
[9:32] understand so many things that brother
[9:34] branham was trying to teach us and was
[9:35] trying to share with us
[9:38] amen i want to continue moving on in the
[9:41] message it is the rising of the sun says
[9:43] he is the one who opened those seals he
[9:45] is those seals
[9:48] for the whole word of god is christ and
[9:50] christ is the seals that was open what
[9:53] is the opening of the seals then
[9:55] revealing christ
[9:57] oh brothers and sisters i absolutely
[10:00] love this message amen and without this
[10:02] without brother venom coming and
[10:04] correcting our understanding amen i
[10:06] don't even know how we can understand i
[10:08] mean the seals in the preaching past the
[10:10] seals how in the world can you
[10:11] understand 1965's ministry if you don't
[10:14] catch this concept amen that the word is
[10:17] god amen when when when the word come
[10:20] out from god god calls the word that
[10:23] come from his thought when it was
[10:25] birthed he calls that sun or offspring
[10:29] and that offspring as it comes into
[10:32] manifestation in each season is christ
[10:37] amen
[10:38] so what was the opening of the seals it
[10:41] wasn't ten sermons over eight days
[10:47] he is those seals
[10:52] for the whole word of god is christ and
[10:54] christ is the seals that was opened what
[10:56] is the opening the seals then revealing
[10:58] christ so what was the opening of the
[11:00] seals revealing christ that's why the
[11:03] the opening of the seals was such a
[11:04] monumental shift in the ministry of
[11:06] brother branham amen is when he actually
[11:09] came in to his revelations 10 ministry
[11:12] amen to reveal the mystery of god and
[11:14] the mystery of god is christ what was
[11:17] the revealing of the seals what was the
[11:19] opening of the seals it was revealing
[11:20] christ what christ was he revealing amen
[11:23] he was revealing christ of this entire
[11:25] bible
[11:26] that's why when he would come to the
[11:28] message christ is the mr god revealed he
[11:30] said i take from my context the entire
[11:32] bible
[11:33] because he's going to be preaching
[11:34] christ is the mystery of god revealed so
[11:37] there's been a mystery of god that he
[11:38] had in his thinking before the
[11:40] foundation of the world and that mystery
[11:42] of god was a plan in which he would
[11:45] display himself amen so that he could be
[11:47] expressed and be known and have
[11:50] fellowship with himself as a family
[11:53] and so there's a mystery that's been in
[11:55] this whole bible but christ is the
[11:58] mystery of god revealed so what is
[12:01] christ christ is the word amen that is
[12:04] manifest expressed may manifest in the
[12:07] day or season that is christ
[12:11] so christ the word made manifest in each
[12:14] season that is christ and christ the
[12:17] word made manifest or expressed or
[12:20] declared in each season is the mystery
[12:23] of god
[12:25] there's no brother man said there's
[12:27] nothing out of cater nothing's wrong
[12:29] amen everything from genesis to
[12:31] revelation is god becoming material so
[12:34] that he can be
[12:36] filled god coming into manifestation and
[12:40] as god was coming into manifestation
[12:42] that anointed word christ means the
[12:44] anointed that anointed word or
[12:47] attributes or expressions or thoughts
[12:49] however you want to put it that anointed
[12:52] word expressed in that day was christ
[12:55] that's why brother of him said it was
[12:56] christ in noah it was christ in moses it
[12:59] was christ in david
[13:02] the vessels were fallen vessels the
[13:05] vessels were clay i mean they were
[13:08] minerals that were gathered out of the
[13:09] earth formed into a vessel amen those
[13:11] vessels were fallen those vessels needed
[13:14] redemption those vessels were born in
[13:16] sin but there was a portion of life down
[13:19] inside of there in an expression that
[13:21] was coming through that vessel and the
[13:22] expression through moses was an
[13:24] expression of christ
[13:28] now
[13:29] when moses amen when moses was making
[13:33] mistakes he wasn't expressing christ
[13:36] he was expressing moses
[13:39] but when moses was expressing that
[13:42] portion of the word that had to be
[13:44] expressed in that day that was christ
[13:46] amen he was expressing christ
[13:49] so the confusing part down through the
[13:52] bible and down through time and the
[13:53] confusing part all around us and even of
[13:56] our own lives amen is this this part
[13:58] that was born in sin shaped in iniquity
[14:01] amen that expresses sometimes a fallen
[14:04] nature and fallen thoughts and all of
[14:06] these things and we looked at that and
[14:07] we say how can that be christ how could
[14:10] david be christ when david would murder
[14:12] a man commit adultery and murder a man
[14:14] to cover it up that part wasn't christ
[14:17] that part was fallen
[14:21] but when david amen would look over at
[14:24] jerusalem as a rejected king and then
[14:27] weep over jerusalem how oft i would have
[14:29] poverty he said that was that was not
[14:32] the man that was christ that was the
[14:33] word that was expressing
[14:36] when he was anointed to be king amen and
[14:38] then he was running amen as a fugitive
[14:41] from cave to cave rejected and that was
[14:44] christ being made manifest
[14:48] so
[14:49] we we have to understand there's been a
[14:51] mystery
[14:53] and christ is the mystery of god
[14:56] revealed what was the opening of the
[14:58] seals revealing christ revealing christ
[15:00] where revealing christ through the whole
[15:03] bible
[15:05] that's why brother branham would say
[15:07] when when the seals opened my bible
[15:09] became a new book to me
[15:13] because when we open the seals we reveal
[15:15] christ we reveal christ as the mystery
[15:18] of god
[15:20] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[15:24] which is the seventh seal
[15:27] which is revelation 10 7.
[15:31] so
[15:34] it's
[15:37] it's so
[15:38] profound yet so simple
[15:42] it's so complex as it weaves its way
[15:45] down through time but yet it's so simple
[15:49] it's it's unbelievable
[15:52] brother branham says in satan's eden
[15:53] from 1965 he's and so god knew that he
[15:57] would be here
[15:58] but then he put us in flesh so we would
[16:00] be contacted in order he could contact
[16:03] he became one of us when he became jesus
[16:05] christ the son of god himself the
[16:07] fullness of the manifestation of god
[16:09] therefore that was god's purpose to
[16:11] display his attributes in fellowship
[16:14] when i was in my father i knew nothing
[16:16] about it but when i became his son and
[16:19] was born of him i was an attribute a
[16:21] part of my father and you're a part of
[16:23] your father
[16:24] and as children of god we are part of
[16:26] god's attribute that was in him made
[16:28] flesh like he was made flesh so we can
[16:31] have fellowship one with the other as a
[16:33] family of god upon the earth and that
[16:35] was god's purpose at the beginning yes
[16:38] sir that's what god wanted at the
[16:40] beginning
[16:42] so what did god want god wanted
[16:45] he wanted
[16:46] i'll read it again as children of god we
[16:48] are part of god's attribute that was in
[16:51] him
[16:53] so you have something in you that was in
[16:55] him
[16:58] and that part in you that was in him is
[17:00] what makes you a son and a son is a part
[17:04] of god and a son
[17:06] a son is an offspring
[17:09] now you sisters don't get discouraged
[17:11] you're a son too
[17:15] we can call you daughter but really what
[17:18] sun means is offspring
[17:20] that's really when you get down to the
[17:22] core of the word a sun is offspring amen
[17:25] that which comes out amen and so the
[17:27] word of god came out from god that was
[17:30] sun that was offspring amen contained in
[17:33] that word and that logos was all the
[17:35] thought of god all the attributes of god
[17:37] so all the sons of god were in there
[17:41] and we'll say sons and daughters of god
[17:44] so that you know that those sons are
[17:46] male and female
[17:47] in their expression in this day
[17:51] but now that's the offspring of god and
[17:54] so that word as a whole amen is the son
[17:58] of god but as it comes down as
[18:01] individual thoughts i'll just say
[18:04] individual thoughts
[18:06] i don't know that god has individual
[18:08] thoughts i mean like we do god's
[18:10] thinking is whole he never lose any of
[18:13] his whole thinking when he thinks of the
[18:15] individual it's still in context of the
[18:16] whole
[18:18] god's thinking is not like our thinking
[18:19] amen so but we take one of those
[18:21] attributes let's say one of those
[18:23] thoughts one portion of that word amen
[18:26] and that portion of that word would come
[18:28] down amen it would rest in a soul amen
[18:31] that would be expressed in a body of
[18:33] flesh on the earth but because of the
[18:34] fall in the garden that flesh would come
[18:36] with corruption with the wrong nature
[18:38] with all of these things but there's
[18:39] still a thought of god an attribute of
[18:42] god a gene of god in that soul
[18:47] that's why in the old testament it could
[18:49] be god above us or god with us the holy
[18:51] ghost was there moving and the holy
[18:53] ghost was moving upon that seed that was
[18:55] in the soul but the holy ghost or the
[18:58] life of god could no longer dwell inside
[19:00] of that soul until the purging that took
[19:03] place at calvary
[19:05] but it could influence and move over and
[19:08] begin to move amen to the brood over and
[19:10] move all these positions into place and
[19:13] sort things out but after calvary now
[19:15] that life could come right in and
[19:17] quicken that seed to life and it could
[19:18] be the very life of christ the very life
[19:21] of god living in this tabernacle
[19:25] so as these expressions would be coming
[19:27] down through time amen there would be an
[19:29] expression of
[19:31] of the word amen a part of the word a
[19:34] piece off of god amen a portion of the
[19:37] attribute a portion of the thought if
[19:39] you just if we want to say it that way
[19:41] just for us to understand it amen and as
[19:43] that would come down and land in a
[19:45] vessel of clay when it would begin the
[19:47] holy ghost would begin to work the
[19:49] circumstances and brood over amen to get
[19:52] the action out of that individual that
[19:55] god wanted to express in that day when
[19:57] the action would come out when the words
[19:59] would be spoken and the deeds would be
[20:01] done that god had ordained for that
[20:03] portion of the word to express in that
[20:05] day that was christ
[20:10] amen
[20:13] so what god wanted in the beginning
[20:16] amen before the before the fallen his
[20:18] original thought what god wanted
[20:21] he wanted the
[20:22] uh i'll read it again and the children
[20:24] of god we are part of god's attribute
[20:26] that was in him that's how we're
[20:28] children
[20:31] because it's that part that came out of
[20:33] him
[20:35] that's offspring
[20:38] that's progeny
[20:40] that's son
[20:46] as children of god we are part of god's
[20:48] attribute that was in him made flesh
[20:50] like he was made flesh so we can have
[20:52] fellowship one with the other
[20:56] this is why
[20:58] fellowship is way more critical than you
[21:00] think
[21:01] because it's part of god's original
[21:03] purpose in the beginning
[21:05] that's why staying off to by ourselves
[21:07] and staying away and separating from
[21:08] fellowship and i've been hurt before and
[21:10] i'll just stay home and i'll just listen
[21:12] to tapes and i'll i'll do my own thing
[21:14] that was not god's original plan
[21:17] that's not god's thinking from the
[21:18] beginning
[21:20] amen no matter how many times you get
[21:21] your toes stepped on and you get hurt
[21:23] amen through fellowship you can't avoid
[21:25] fellowship because that was god's
[21:26] original plan
[21:28] he wants his sons expressions of himself
[21:31] to fellowship together as a family of
[21:33] god upon the earth that was his plan
[21:35] from the beginning
[21:37] so we better be expressing his thought
[21:39] amen why do we come together why do we
[21:41] meet in each other's homes why do we
[21:43] have fellowship around the word why do
[21:45] we care for one another because that's
[21:46] what god thought was in the beginning
[21:49] that's what he wanted that's the way he
[21:50] wanted to express himself as a family in
[21:53] flesh upon the earth expressing the
[21:55] attributes of god together in fellowship
[21:58] that's what we'll have in the new
[21:59] heavens and new earth in that city it'll
[22:01] be all those expressions collected
[22:03] together in that city and the shekinah
[22:05] glory of god the the intelligence the
[22:07] intellect the thought the illumination
[22:09] amen will be over that city and they'll
[22:11] be the whole it will be it'll be god
[22:14] made tangible flesh fellowshipping
[22:16] together as a family of god in that city
[22:20] that was god's original purpose and
[22:22] god's going to have that purpose and god
[22:24] already has a plan in his mind and we
[22:26] already know the end of the story and
[22:27] the end of the story is god will have
[22:29] his purpose on this earth
[22:33] he amen
[22:35] god is so good
[22:38] so every part of this we talk about new
[22:40] heavens and new earth and when we talk
[22:42] about the seed gene of god we talk about
[22:45] uh uh the the relationship between those
[22:47] outside of the city and in the city the
[22:49] book of life in the lamb's book it's all
[22:51] talking about the same thing
[22:54] there's a continuity in this word of god
[22:56] amen in the continuity of the word of
[22:58] god is to express god's desire god's
[23:01] thought which is to express himself or
[23:04] manifest himself in flesh on earth as a
[23:07] family having fellowship together
[23:14] that's what god's purpose was at the
[23:16] beginning yes sir that's what god wanted
[23:18] at the beginning
[23:20] i'm going to go to the smyrna church age
[23:22] out of the church age book and i want to
[23:23] read a portion of that it says
[23:26] now then
[23:27] here we are coming to a conclusion
[23:30] as the eternal logos god was manifest in
[23:33] the sun and then jesus dwelt all the
[23:34] fullness of the godhead bodily and that
[23:37] eternal one was the father manifest in
[23:39] flesh and thereby gain the title of son
[23:42] even so we eternal in his thoughts in
[23:45] our turn became the many members spoken
[23:47] word seed
[23:48] manifest in flesh
[23:50] and those eternal thoughts now manifest
[23:52] in flesh are the sons of god even as we
[23:55] are so called
[23:57] we did not become seed by the rebirth
[24:01] very important
[24:03] we were seed and therefore were reborn
[24:07] for only the elect can be reborn
[24:12] because we were seed as the reason we
[24:15] could be quickened in non-seed there is
[24:17] nothing to quicken
[24:20] so that does not mean that those people
[24:22] are eternally lost and will be damned to
[24:24] hell it just means they do not have one
[24:27] of those attributes of god's thinking or
[24:28] gene of god in the soul
[24:31] but it doesn't mean there will not be
[24:33] mercy granted and salvation given at the
[24:35] white throne judgment to certain
[24:37] individuals
[24:38] but those individuals are not
[24:40] individuals who can be born again
[24:42] because only those with a sieging of god
[24:45] are individuals that can be born again
[24:48] and everybody with the seeding of god an
[24:50] individual that can be born again will
[24:52] go in the first resurrection in the
[24:54] rapture not in the second which comes up
[24:56] in the judgment
[24:59] it's clearly explained in the message
[25:02] he says hold this carefully in mind
[25:04] now take the next step redeemed means to
[25:07] buy back
[25:08] it restores to the original owner god by
[25:11] his death the shed blood bought back his
[25:14] own
[25:15] he bought back the spoken word seed
[25:17] bride my sheep hear my voice word and
[25:21] they followed me you always were a sheep
[25:23] you never were a pig or a dog turned
[25:25] into a sheep
[25:27] that is impossible for every kind of
[25:28] life produces the same kind and there is
[25:30] no change in species as we were in the
[25:33] thoughts of god and then expressed in
[25:35] flesh there had to come a day when we
[25:37] would hear his voice the word
[25:40] i love that hear his voice the word and
[25:43] hearing that voice become aware of our
[25:45] father calling us and recognize that we
[25:48] are the sons of god we heard his voice
[25:50] and we cried out as did the prodigal son
[25:52] save me o my father i'm returning to
[25:54] thee
[25:56] listen now brother branham expresses
[25:58] when when you come to the salvation when
[26:01] you hear the word and come to the new
[26:02] birth it's a restoring back your
[26:05] relationship to your father it says
[26:07] father i'm coming back amen
[26:10] say me my father i am returning to thee
[26:13] amen and so what so many times is
[26:16] labeled as getting saved under a
[26:18] denominational idea it means
[26:21] we're turning amen a chicken into an
[26:23] eagle we're turning a dog into our goat
[26:25] into a sheep but that is not what the
[26:28] prophet of god is teaching us and that
[26:29] is not what the scriptures say
[26:34] amen because jesus came to seek and to
[26:36] save that which was lost he came for the
[26:38] sheep that his father gave him amen
[26:40] those that he was coming for didn't know
[26:42] that they were sheep
[26:44] but he knew they were sheep and he
[26:46] wasn't coming for the whole world he was
[26:47] coming for his that were in the world
[26:51] all right
[26:53] now we're we're going to say some things
[26:54] it seems harsh but if you just would
[26:57] just be patient with me for a minute
[26:59] you'll realize amen that god the whole
[27:02] purpose of redemption was for god to
[27:04] redeem back himself
[27:09] his own his own what his own thoughts
[27:12] amen what are his thoughts it's not
[27:14] something secondary to him
[27:17] the word of god is not something
[27:18] secondary to god it is god
[27:21] it is the thought of god which would
[27:24] which god amen when he was all alone and
[27:27] there was nothing made that was made he
[27:28] was god alone with his thoughts amen and
[27:30] that thought as he would express it was
[27:32] the word amen and that word was god
[27:37] it was god expressed in another form
[27:41] all right and so
[27:43] that word now amen it it comes down into
[27:48] the purpose that he had for in each age
[27:50] and begins to manifest amen but but when
[27:53] that word comes down god knows before
[27:56] the foundation of the world
[27:58] that there will be a fall
[28:01] because jesus christ is the lamb slain
[28:03] from the before the foundation of the
[28:04] world
[28:06] so in god's mind he knew that there
[28:08] would be a plan of re he knew there
[28:10] would be a fall needing redemption
[28:12] needing a slain lamb that there would be
[28:14] redemption amen but god's plan of
[28:17] redemption
[28:18] oh i don't know how to say this god's
[28:21] plan of redemption was to redeem back
[28:24] himself that would come in this fallen
[28:25] condition
[28:28] so redemption is for the seed
[28:32] not for the non-seed
[28:37] but it doesn't mean that the non-seed
[28:39] don't benefit from redemption
[28:42] the non-seed can benefit from redemption
[28:44] but redemption is not necessarily for
[28:46] them amen redemption is for the seed
[28:49] because he's buying back himself he's
[28:51] buying back his own
[28:54] all right
[28:55] and so the non-seed can be a benefactor
[28:59] of that because when christ came and
[29:01] shed his blood amen he bought back all
[29:04] of creation
[29:06] he bought back the earth he bought back
[29:07] all he brought back every body that was
[29:10] made out of the earth everybody that had
[29:11] lived on the earth he purchased all of
[29:14] creation and as purchasing all of
[29:16] creation he now has the rights to all of
[29:18] the creation to do what he will with his
[29:21] own
[29:22] and so when he comes to the white throne
[29:24] judgment he is the one who paid the
[29:26] price his blood is the purchase price
[29:29] for all creation god sent that blood
[29:33] that created blood he sent it to shed
[29:36] for his seed that came in a fallen
[29:38] condition to buy back his own but he
[29:41] couldn't buy back his own the pearl of
[29:43] great price unless he bought the field
[29:48] he bought the field to get the treasure
[29:50] hidden in the field but he had to buy
[29:52] the field
[29:54] but he bought the field to get the
[29:56] treasure hid in the field
[29:58] if there was no treasure hid in the
[30:00] field why would he buy the field
[30:03] but he bought the field because he
[30:05] wanted the treasure hid in the field
[30:09] amen
[30:11] but now because he owns the field he can
[30:14] do whatever he wants with the field
[30:17] so when he comes to the white throne
[30:19] judgment he as the owner of it all can
[30:23] pass the judgment that he chooses he can
[30:25] have mercy on whom he would have mercy
[30:27] because his blood already paid for it
[30:30] amen his blood is already paid amen for
[30:33] this individual is this individual has
[30:36] also been redeemed back but he wasn't
[30:38] the focus of redemption redemption was
[30:40] for the elect
[30:43] so at the white throne judgment all of
[30:45] those that are paid for they don't all
[30:47] get to go into eternal life he owns it
[30:50] all but some because of the way they
[30:53] handled life when they come in contact
[30:55] with it will be refused entrant into
[30:57] eternal life they will go into the lake
[30:59] of fire
[31:01] there are those whose names were never
[31:02] on the book they were going to the lake
[31:04] of fire there's those whose names were
[31:05] on the book but they fought against the
[31:07] true word they will go into the lake of
[31:09] fire amen but they'll be those who were
[31:11] doing a work a support a help amen doing
[31:15] what they could with what they had and
[31:16] staying true to a portion that they had
[31:19] and being a help in the in the ministry
[31:21] and supporting or helping or doing good
[31:24] to the the word of god the elect of god
[31:26] jesus christ on that day will grant them
[31:29] entrance into eternal life why because
[31:31] he owns them and his blood already paid
[31:33] for them
[31:35] but that wasn't the purpose of the sheba
[31:37] the purpose of the shed blood was to
[31:38] bring the elect back to himself
[31:42] so
[31:45] to me this is amazing
[31:48] to me
[31:49] brother branham's teaching on the book
[31:51] of life and salvation
[31:53] is so much better than anything i've
[31:55] ever heard in christian teaching ever at
[31:57] anywhere at any time
[32:00] because in christian teaching all over
[32:03] everywhere at any time amen you have to
[32:05] have a certain confession and you have
[32:07] to have a certain lifestyle and you have
[32:08] to say certain words or attend a certain
[32:10] church or hold to a certain set of
[32:12] beliefs and if you do that then you can
[32:14] be saved and you can be in the new
[32:15] heavens and new earth but brother
[32:17] branham shows us the very nature of god
[32:20] that you see in the whole bible that
[32:21] there are those who are not a part of
[32:23] god amen are not sons of god but they
[32:26] will give an entrance into the kingdom
[32:28] of god amen because of what they did
[32:31] with the word as the word was moving
[32:33] down through
[32:36] and the word is life the word contains
[32:39] life the word is life so when you come
[32:41] in contact with the word you come in
[32:43] contact with life
[32:45] that's why at the white throne judgment
[32:47] i mean really at the white throne
[32:49] judgment is just a repeat of what
[32:52] happened on earth because at the white
[32:54] throne judgment you come and you stand
[32:56] before the word
[32:58] but while you were journeying on earth
[33:01] you had contact with the word at some
[33:03] point you stood before the word
[33:06] amen and when you when you stood before
[33:08] that word and you could serve it and you
[33:10] could love it and you could even if you
[33:12] didn't understand even if you only had a
[33:13] nugget but but you did what you could
[33:15] with that word amen you were that's how
[33:18] you were reacting to life
[33:21] that's how you were treating life or
[33:23] reacting to life or interacting with
[33:24] life amen but if you hated that
[33:26] manifestation of the word and you did
[33:28] evil and tried to shut it down or spoke
[33:30] evil against it or blasphemed it amen
[33:32] what you're doing is showing your
[33:34] attitude or conduct towards
[33:36] life so when you come at the white
[33:39] throne judgment and stand before the
[33:41] word which is christ and his bride and
[33:44] all the elect redeemed sitting on the
[33:46] throne you're once again standing before
[33:49] life and what you did with life is what
[33:52] will determine
[33:54] whether you go into life or not
[33:57] that's why i said the white throne
[33:58] judgment is just a repeat you're coming
[34:00] to face life again but you already faced
[34:02] it in your earthly journey
[34:06] so
[34:07] this message
[34:09] i just say is perfect
[34:12] it's perfect it's the bible
[34:15] it's the word it's christ
[34:18] it
[34:18] it contains i said this before but every
[34:22] doctrine that brother branham restored
[34:23] to us contained the very nature of god
[34:26] in the doctrine it wasn't an isolated
[34:28] teaching just a teaching on godhead or
[34:30] just a teaching on water baptism or the
[34:32] teaching on on the book of life amen you
[34:34] can't just take it as an isolated
[34:36] teaching and this is interesting and wow
[34:38] this is neat but it contained within it
[34:40] the very nature of god the nature of god
[34:43] of the bible amen that's why when we get
[34:45] into doctrinal debates and people want
[34:47] to start uh debating doctrine and debate
[34:50] doctrine with you know denominational
[34:52] individuals debate doctrine within the
[34:54] message however you want to debate
[34:56] doctrine the doctrine didn't come to
[34:58] give us something a tool for debate amen
[35:00] it didn't come to make us right it
[35:02] didn't come to make us theologians it
[35:04] came to restore back our understanding
[35:06] to align our thought with the thought of
[35:08] god so that we could express the very
[35:10] nature of god
[35:12] so when we get into doctrinal debates we
[35:14] instantly have got ourselves out of the
[35:16] nature of god because god doesn't debate
[35:18] about his word
[35:20] he doesn't argue he doesn't fuss he
[35:22] doesn't debate amen
[35:24] god doesn't use apologetics
[35:26] god just speaks his word and moves on
[35:28] it's four two it's four it's not four
[35:30] who is not four
[35:36] amen
[35:38] so the the doctrine that brother
[35:40] brennaman restored to teaching the
[35:42] correct teaching on the word amen when
[35:44] brother branham restores the word
[35:47] when god restores it through that vessel
[35:49] i should say it that way through the
[35:50] seventh angel amen it's going it's
[35:53] running that doctrine is running from
[35:55] genesis to revelation
[35:58] because it's a very it's the word and
[36:01] the word is running from genesis to
[36:03] revelation and the word contains the
[36:05] thought the thought contains the
[36:06] character
[36:09] so
[36:10] i want to finish this quote
[36:13] i'll go all the way back here
[36:15] you always were sheep
[36:18] you never were a pig or a dog turned
[36:20] into a sheep that is impossible for
[36:22] every kind of life produces the same
[36:24] kind and there is no change in species
[36:26] as we were in the thoughts of god and
[36:28] then expressed in flesh there had to
[36:30] come a day when we would hear his voice
[36:34] word and hearing that voice become aware
[36:36] of our father calling us and recognize
[36:38] that we we are the sons of god i did
[36:41] read this but we'll read it again we
[36:43] heard his voice and we cried out as did
[36:45] the prodigal son say me o my father i'm
[36:48] returning to thee
[36:50] so the voice that we heard is the word
[36:54] the word that we heard in this day
[36:56] should give us an understanding of where
[36:59] we came from and where we're at and that
[37:01] we're returning back to the father amen
[37:04] the word that we're hearing for this day
[37:06] the correct teaching correct doctrine
[37:08] amen does not have us to be something
[37:10] else other than the father son who's
[37:12] hoping to come into
[37:15] somebody else's house
[37:18] to be adopted in a modern term of
[37:20] adoption
[37:22] but the right teaching the correct
[37:24] teaching amen from the bible teaches us
[37:26] that when we hear the word amen that is
[37:29] our father calling us and we as the
[37:31] prodigal son run back and say father i'm
[37:34] returning to thee
[37:37] i'm not just coming to thee that's a
[37:39] correct turn i'm coming to the lord
[37:41] that's correct but you have to remember
[37:43] i'm coming back to the lord where i came
[37:45] from
[37:46] i'm returning to thee
[37:50] praise be to god you understand how the
[37:53] correct teaching of the bible changes
[37:55] the entire concept and mindset and blows
[37:58] away denominational thinking already out
[38:00] of the shoe because denominational
[38:02] thinking will always have you wondering
[38:04] whether or not you are a son amen and if
[38:06] i could lose my sonship and hoping that
[38:08] i get accepted into this house because
[38:10] this is the right father i was born
[38:11] under the wrong father i'm hoping i can
[38:13] get him to promise to be my father
[38:17] and then then if i do something wrong
[38:19] maybe i'll have to go back to my
[38:20] original father or get cast out of the
[38:22] father's house
[38:24] but the correct biblical teaching has
[38:26] you so secure amen when you hear the
[38:29] word and the word is revealed to you and
[38:31] it's your father calling you and
[38:32] something inside of you response to that
[38:34] word amen it is an indication that you
[38:37] came from the same source that word came
[38:39] from and that's your father calling you
[38:41] why would your father call why would god
[38:43] play games with somebody who's not his
[38:45] child
[38:47] when he begins to reveal the word and
[38:49] you hear the word for your day amen and
[38:51] it triggers something inside of you and
[38:53] you see you find the matching piece amen
[38:56] and you run back and say father i'm
[38:58] returning unto you amen you realize that
[39:01] this call this eagle scream in this
[39:03] message amen was the thing that was to
[39:05] wake up the portion of me that came from
[39:07] god originally and when that portion
[39:09] quickens comes the life under the
[39:11] baptism of holy ghost i recognize who my
[39:14] father is i'm not a chicken i never was
[39:17] a chicken i wasn't a chicken hoping to
[39:19] become an eagle i've always from the
[39:21] very birth been an eagle i just was
[39:23] stuck in the wrong mindset i was
[39:26] earthbound and thought that i was a
[39:27] chicken but when i heard the eagle
[39:29] scream i realized that i've never been a
[39:31] goat i've always been a sheep
[39:34] and now i can cry my father i'm coming
[39:37] back to thee
[39:40] and when we catch the right concept of
[39:42] that friends it's not this i'm in one
[39:45] day out the next in one day out the next
[39:47] if i'm good enough i'll be accepted oh
[39:49] it blows all of that stuff out of the
[39:51] water and you recognize that the god
[39:53] came seeking me the father came calling
[39:56] me the egg eagle flew over the chicken
[39:58] yard where i was amen
[40:01] to call me back to where i belong
[40:07] and now
[40:10] if i misbehave as a sheep
[40:14] i'm a misbehaving sheep
[40:19] i can't go back to being a
[40:22] goat if i'm a sheep running with the
[40:25] goats i'm still a sheep
[40:29] if i'm an eagle who goes back in the
[40:30] chin yard and scratches it manure piled
[40:33] again i'm still an eagle
[40:37] i'm not going back to be a chicken no
[40:39] matter how many times i make mistakes or
[40:41] or the storms of life blow me back to
[40:43] the ground or or or whatever i'm never
[40:46] going to change species because i never
[40:49] changed in the first place what i was i
[40:51] always was if i'm a son of god i've
[40:53] always been a son of god i didn't become
[40:56] a son of god i was reborn because i was
[40:58] seed amen i did not become seed by
[41:01] rebirth i was reborn because i was seed
[41:08] so praise be to god
[41:11] let's go to romans chapter 8.
[41:22] the message did not come to bring
[41:24] insecurity
[41:28] the message did not come to make us
[41:29] wonder
[41:31] who we are and if we're really one of
[41:32] them if i could be bride that wasn't the
[41:34] purpose of the message
[41:38] if that's what the message is doing to
[41:40] us we need to go back and recheck what
[41:42] message we've heard
[41:44] and what our revelation is
[41:49] romans 8
[41:52] verse 29
[41:55] for whom
[41:56] he did for no
[41:58] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[42:00] to the image of his son
[42:02] that he might be the firstborn among
[42:04] many brethren
[42:07] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[42:09] he also called and whom he called them
[42:11] he also justified and whom he justified
[42:14] then he also glorified
[42:17] what shall we then say to these things
[42:20] if god before us who can be against us
[42:26] i hope i make it to my glorification i
[42:29] hope that i can just make it in the
[42:31] rapture i hope that i can hold on i hope
[42:33] that i don't fall away i hope i can make
[42:35] it listen that's the wrong revelation he
[42:38] has already glorified me
[42:42] he has already glorified me when in his
[42:46] thinking i know that's his thinking but
[42:47] i want to be really glorified his
[42:50] thoughts are eternal his thoughts are
[42:52] real that is the real reality this is
[42:54] the reflection the shadow that's the
[42:56] real and if i was glorified in the real
[43:00] and if i'm in the shadow and i don't
[43:02] look glorified it doesn't matter i've
[43:03] got to go back to the real and in the
[43:05] real i'm already glorified
[43:08] i'm just here dropped into this hickey
[43:11] of time so that i can act out what's
[43:13] already taken place in the mind of god
[43:15] so i'm moving in an act as if i'm not
[43:18] yet glorified
[43:21] so that we can play out the drama so
[43:24] that god can have expression so that he
[43:26] can complete all the things he wanted to
[43:27] do to express himself in time express
[43:30] himself in creation so we're acting it
[43:33] out as if we're not glorified yet
[43:39] but knowing i'm already glorified
[43:46] oh what we need is revelation friends
[43:49] more than anything we need revelation
[43:51] how are you going to miss it when it's
[43:53] already in the mind of god when he
[43:54] already saw it complete when it's a
[43:55] finished work when the period's at the
[43:57] end it's done it's unchangeable he
[44:00] finished it he sealed it amen when he
[44:02] unsealed it there was no there was no
[44:04] changes to the lamb's book of life to
[44:06] the elect seed the eternal life record
[44:08] amen he didn't change it it was already
[44:09] there if it was already there then it's
[44:12] finished for me
[44:16] amen
[44:17] we're in time manifesting what's already
[44:20] been finished
[44:23] amen
[44:25] in the sardisian church age from the
[44:26] church age book the prophet says now
[44:28] then the record of this wheat plant
[44:30] whose end is to reproduce the original
[44:32] seed in multiplied form is the book of
[44:34] life i repeat the history or the record
[44:37] of this wheat plant is the book of life
[44:39] which a part of the book of life is the
[44:42] record of eternal life a section of the
[44:45] book of life
[44:47] all right figure if you can pull up the
[44:48] white whiteboard i'm gonna i'm gonna
[44:50] draw this out like we've been drawing it
[44:51] out but he's saying this book of life is
[44:54] a record of the wheat plant
[44:57] but
[44:58] but in the wheat plant this was
[45:01] everything that it would take to bring
[45:03] the life to bring the original seed back
[45:07] to original form multiplied
[45:10] so in that process everything that was
[45:13] helping that and everything that it was
[45:14] moving through through each stage of the
[45:16] journey was recorded in the book of life
[45:19] but there's a record of eternal life the
[45:21] life of that seed as it's moving all the
[45:23] way through is the record of eternal
[45:26] life
[45:28] and brother bam calls it
[45:30] the record of eternal life a section of
[45:32] the book of life and many times he
[45:34] refers to it as the lamb's book of life
[45:36] now we know that the whole book is the
[45:38] lamb's book of life but for brother
[45:39] branham to explain this to us more often
[45:42] than not he calls the whole book the
[45:44] book of life and he calls the accession
[45:46] the section or the record of eternal
[45:48] life zoe life he calls that the lamb's
[45:51] book of life
[45:53] but here in the church age book he says
[45:55] a part of the book of life is the record
[45:58] of eternal life
[46:00] a section of the book of life
[46:04] he goes on to say in the in the in the
[46:05] token message he says
[46:07] and any greek scholar knows that the
[46:09] word eternal life comes from the word
[46:10] zoe zoe which means god's own life
[46:13] that's right the only way that you ever
[46:15] can have life there is only one form of
[46:17] eternal life and that's god's own life
[46:19] in you
[46:21] then you have eternal life because he is
[46:22] the only eternal there is and we are the
[46:25] attributes of his thoughts before there
[46:27] was even a foundation of the world or
[46:29] anything all this is just his thinking
[46:33] and we're the display of his thoughts of
[46:36] what it was
[46:39] you get that
[46:40] i want to read that again
[46:42] and we and we are the attributes of his
[46:45] thoughts
[46:46] what are attributes of his thoughts word
[46:50] when that word is expressed in this day
[46:52] and season what is it it's christ
[46:57] amen
[46:59] that's why they could ask brother
[47:00] brandon brother branham could you be
[47:01] christ or could christ be you or
[47:02] something like that and question theirs
[47:04] he's uncomfortable reading the question
[47:06] but they think that he's jesus christ
[47:08] and he said to make me the person of
[47:10] jesus christ had to be antichrist
[47:13] but to say that christ is in me working
[47:15] through me now that's the truth
[47:20] so to make me the inhabitation of that
[47:23] full life and that full word that's
[47:25] wrong
[47:28] but to make me the habitation of a part
[47:30] of that life and a part of that word
[47:32] that's true
[47:34] and that is also christ
[47:38] so if that is christ
[47:40] to call that antichrist is wrong
[47:45] brother man said see how close it is
[47:47] it's just the difference of a razor's
[47:49] edge
[47:52] to say that that any individual is the
[47:55] full life of jesus christ that's
[47:57] antichrist
[47:59] but to say a portion of that life that
[48:02] was in jesus christ and a portion of
[48:04] that word that was in him when he went
[48:05] to calvary is in me that's truth and
[48:07] that's christ
[48:12] amen
[48:14] so you can't just reject one idea and go
[48:16] way over here when brother bam said when
[48:18] you reject this idea the truth is just
[48:20] over here
[48:22] it's not like this is wrong this is
[48:23] right this is wrong
[48:25] this is right
[48:28] so you have to be careful how you handle
[48:30] that
[48:32] amen
[48:35] that's why
[48:37] in the the message who is this
[48:38] melchizedek
[48:44] brother bam says
[48:45] god vindicates
[48:47] that's always been right god vindicates
[48:49] it to be true so plainly the
[48:51] predestinated is the only one that's
[48:53] considered in redemption
[48:56] did you get that let me say that again
[48:58] the predestination is the only one
[49:00] that's considered in redemption
[49:03] people might be making like think they
[49:05] are but the real redemption is those
[49:07] that are predestinated because their
[49:09] very word redeem means to bring back is
[49:11] that right the redeem is something to
[49:14] redeem anything is bring it back to its
[49:16] original place hallelujah so it's only
[49:18] the predestinated will be brought back
[49:20] because the others didn't come from
[49:21] there see bring back being eternal with
[49:24] him at the beginning the eternal life
[49:27] that you had his thought of what you was
[49:30] only he wanted you he wanted me to stand
[49:33] in the pulpit say he wanted you to sit
[49:36] in the seat tonight then we are serving
[49:38] his eternal purpose and the one that
[49:40] left home only came to the earth to
[49:43] serve his purpose
[49:45] is that right all right then after it's
[49:47] finished it's brought back in a
[49:49] glorified state it's matured and brought
[49:51] back again
[49:53] amen so the one that come from heaven i
[49:56] wonder who those are
[49:58] who are the ones that come in well jesus
[50:00] christ amen i'm part of that
[50:02] manifestation amen i'm part of that sun
[50:05] manifestation
[50:08] when god amen when god created his first
[50:11] son on earth he created adam and a flesh
[50:13] being adam was the son of god
[50:17] part of that son
[50:18] was the woman
[50:22] so when god
[50:24] when god portioned himself out into adam
[50:27] and then adam came a portion of the life
[50:29] of god and god brought it into flesh
[50:31] within that portion was the woman amen
[50:34] so when adam came and expressed on earth
[50:36] the woman was part of that
[50:40] right
[50:42] and she came into a further expression
[50:44] or adam i should say i say she did but
[50:47] adam came into a further expression of
[50:49] she
[50:51] it was adam forming into she a further
[50:55] expression of him
[50:58] so that's why when you when you look at
[51:01] jesus christ if you're the bride of
[51:02] jesus christ when christ came forth from
[51:05] the mind of god as the logos you have to
[51:07] be included in that
[51:09] when he come to earth in the form of
[51:10] flesh you have to be included in that
[51:12] when he was hanging at calvary to pay
[51:14] the price of the sins of the world you
[51:15] have to be included in that
[51:18] because that was the full measure of the
[51:20] word and if i'm a part of that measure
[51:23] if i'm a measure of that word then i had
[51:25] to be included wherever the fullness was
[51:27] so when the fullness was in the mind of
[51:29] god i had to be in the mind of god when
[51:32] the fullness moves into the logos the
[51:33] pillar of fire i have to be in the
[51:35] pillar of fire when that fullness moves
[51:37] in the flesh i have to be in that flesh
[51:42] amen
[51:44] so when
[51:46] when a clinker comes off of that logos
[51:50] and it comes down
[51:52] and it becomes the life of moses
[51:56] moses is expressing a part of that word
[51:59] a part of that thought an eternal
[52:01] attribute of god and as moses is
[52:03] expressing in his day it's christ
[52:09] and because
[52:10] because the portion of god
[52:14] that was in moses
[52:17] in the portion of god that is in me
[52:20] we're together in the thought of god and
[52:22] together in the logos
[52:26] then when any portion of that comes and
[52:28] expresses
[52:31] i'm there too
[52:35] now that portion
[52:37] that's to be me amen might not have been
[52:39] in that tabernacle of flesh but there
[52:43] listen there is a bond amen there is a
[52:46] i we should say it this way i don't know
[52:48] it's not the right term but i don't know
[52:50] any other term there is a spiritual
[52:52] genetic bond between all the attributes
[52:56] all the attributes carry the same dna of
[52:59] their father
[53:02] so within every one of your cells in
[53:04] your body is a full strand of dna that
[53:07] matches every other strand that's in
[53:09] every other cell in your body
[53:12] but when that cell is an action in your
[53:14] body and where it's placed in your body
[53:16] determines which part of that dna it
[53:19] expresses
[53:21] so if that cell happens to be in a hair
[53:24] follicle there's only a little portion
[53:26] of that full dna that's to be expressed
[53:28] and it's the portion of information that
[53:30] creates more hair at the base of your
[53:32] hair so all day long that little hair
[53:35] cell is reading the dna but it's only
[53:37] reading a small portion because that's
[53:39] the portion that that cell is supposed
[53:41] to uh to manifest in that day
[53:45] something happened to my hair follicle
[53:47] cells
[53:49] and they died
[53:52] just like when you're a baby amen you're
[53:55] growing there's something triggering the
[53:56] cells in your bones to grow grow grow
[53:58] grow grow grow grow but at some point it
[54:00] stops reading the growth portion of the
[54:02] dna and it quits reading that because
[54:04] now it's done
[54:06] it expressed what it was supposed to
[54:07] express
[54:09] but the the information the whole dna
[54:12] strand that's in the bone cell
[54:15] is the same dna that's in the hair
[54:18] follicle cell
[54:21] and they are in the same body and part
[54:24] of the same thing
[54:27] so they are genetically bound
[54:31] because they all have the same code the
[54:33] same dna in every cell in your body
[54:38] so also is the body of christ
[54:42] so when the
[54:44] when the
[54:45] hair follicle is making hair
[54:48] which is a really good thing for our
[54:50] barbers here in the church they pray for
[54:52] those
[54:53] hair follicle cells
[54:56] because it keeps growing you keep
[54:57] cutting they keep working they're
[54:58] working working all the time but they're
[55:00] to express a portion of this life of you
[55:06] but what is a hair follicle
[55:08] it's me
[55:10] what's it expressing it's expressing me
[55:16] what is uh uh
[55:18] i mean whatever you have cells all over
[55:20] your by skin cells you have skin cells
[55:22] just constantly making more skin as you
[55:24] have skin dye and flake off new skins
[55:26] coming up from underneath so you have
[55:27] cells in your skin that's making more
[55:29] skin they're not doing what the hair
[55:31] follicles doing they're doing what a
[55:32] cell does but it's got the same exact
[55:35] dna as a hair follicle because it's part
[55:38] of the same person part of the same
[55:40] thing
[55:44] but it's down here making skin so what
[55:47] is the hair follicle expressing me what
[55:49] is the skin uh what is the skin cell uh
[55:52] manifesting me it's all manifesting me
[55:55] it's my
[55:56] skin cell it's my skin it's
[56:00] me
[56:02] the cell and the hair follicle it's
[56:04] expressing me it's my cell it's me and
[56:07] they're all genetically bound by having
[56:10] the same exact information or word that
[56:13] links them all because there's only one
[56:15] word that makes me and that's a word
[56:17] that makes me different than you in the
[56:19] flesh amen and that is my dna that is
[56:22] the word that makes me
[56:25] and every part of me has the same word
[56:30] oh i hope this makes sense
[56:32] this is why brother branham could say
[56:34] amen it was christ and moses christ no
[56:36] but he said when when when they were
[56:38] crossing the red sea i was there
[56:42] amen i wasn't there in this physical
[56:44] being with these eyes and these hands
[56:46] and this earthly makeup amen but i am
[56:48] genetically bound to the dna as a seed
[56:51] gene of god i am i am fixed to them
[56:54] every gene of god comes from the same
[56:56] place is from the same material is part
[56:59] of the same thing
[57:03] so when they cross the red sea i crossed
[57:05] the red sea
[57:10] listen
[57:12] when my finger pushes the button on the
[57:15] elevator
[57:16] to go up
[57:19] then we all push the button
[57:24] my toes my legs my i didn't take my toes
[57:28] out of my shoes but when this part of my
[57:30] body pushed it we all pushed it
[57:33] and we all went up to the next floor
[57:39] this is the life of god coming down
[57:41] through
[57:44] manifesting in each age
[57:46] and it is
[57:47] christ
[57:49] boy i hope i can get to what i want to
[57:51] get to
[57:53] oh god is so good there's it's like
[57:56] there's never an end to this it just
[57:58] keeps going deeper in layers upon layers
[58:00] upon layers upon layers what god has
[58:02] done for us in the end time is he's
[58:04] peeled the layers off the confusion so
[58:06] that we can see the reality
[58:09] and so
[58:10] i want to just go back to this
[58:12] uh what brother branham was telling us
[58:15] about the wheat plant
[58:17] so the wheat grows up
[58:19] we've got leaves i can't remember what
[58:20] wheat looks like
[58:21] but
[58:22] at the end
[58:24] there's a torso
[58:25] and in here
[58:27] there's shuck
[58:33] all right all the seeds that are in that
[58:36] head they all come from the same seed
[58:40] they all carry the same seed dna in them
[58:43] they're all an expression of the one
[58:45] seed
[58:47] so brother branham tells us about
[58:49] he says the book of life the whole book
[58:51] of life
[58:52] when you look at it brother ben will say
[58:55] this
[58:56] is the book of life
[58:59] the whole plant
[59:01] but he points to this little seed in
[59:03] here
[59:05] and he says this is the record of
[59:06] eternal life
[59:12] he calls it lamb's book of life
[59:20] the record
[59:23] of the seed
[59:26] he calls it so many things
[59:29] and what he begins to tell us about the
[59:32] book of life now we're not going to talk
[59:33] about individual ages
[59:35] when he goes to this description we're
[59:36] not talking about luther's age
[59:38] specifically or wesley's age or all that
[59:40] we're just talking about a concept of an
[59:42] entire image one image in the image of a
[59:45] wheat plant
[59:47] now in this book of life let me go over
[59:49] here
[59:54] in this book of life
[59:56] all of this
[59:57] was necessary to get to this
[1:00:01] you had to have the stalk grow up you
[1:00:03] had to have the leaves come out because
[1:00:05] it requires photosynthesis to keep
[1:00:07] putting food in to keep growing and it
[1:00:09] requires all of this as it comes up but
[1:00:12] the goal was to get back to the seed
[1:00:14] amen and so all of this is working
[1:00:17] together in harmony to bring about the
[1:00:19] plan of the seed from the original to
[1:00:22] bring it up and to seed again
[1:00:24] right
[1:00:26] so
[1:00:27] when it gets up to harvest time amen
[1:00:31] these leaves here
[1:00:33] they begin to drop off and fade away
[1:00:36] drop off fight away the stock all turns
[1:00:38] brown the shock pulls away
[1:00:42] and as it pulls away some of it even
[1:00:44] falls off
[1:00:45] what's the shuck as it's pulling away
[1:00:47] from the seed begins to reject the seed
[1:00:52] it begins to separate itself from their
[1:00:54] seed and reject the seed and because it
[1:00:57] rejects the seed
[1:00:59] it is
[1:01:00] it is rejected from life
[1:01:04] it was part of the book of life because
[1:01:06] it was part of what was helping the seed
[1:01:08] come to maturity but because at some
[1:01:10] point it rejected the life of the seed
[1:01:13] it gets rejected from life
[1:01:17] and let's just say that these leaves you
[1:01:19] know they dry up they wither they fall
[1:01:21] off they fall away what are they doing
[1:01:23] when they fall away they're rejecting
[1:01:25] the life
[1:01:28] but this stalk right here
[1:01:33] all the way to harvest time
[1:01:37] it keeps holding the seed up
[1:01:40] it never moves away from the seed it
[1:01:42] never rejects the seed but it holds it
[1:01:44] there so that the seed can dry now it's
[1:01:47] not the seed
[1:01:50] now remember i'm not talking about each
[1:01:51] stage each stage had true life
[1:01:54] in each stage so as it was growing there
[1:01:56] was true life there
[1:01:59] but i'm talking about the whole picture
[1:02:00] now just look at the wheat plant as the
[1:02:02] whole picture now
[1:02:04] the the part that was used to help this
[1:02:07] seed grow when it comes to harvest time
[1:02:10] and it begins to dry up and fall away it
[1:02:13] is actually separating itself from the
[1:02:15] life it is rejecting the seed and as the
[1:02:17] shuck begins to open up and pull away
[1:02:19] it's rejecting the seed but the stalk is
[1:02:22] still holding the seed up so that the
[1:02:25] seed can stay in the presence of the sun
[1:02:27] so that the seed can get dry so that the
[1:02:29] seed can go to harvest so at harvest
[1:02:32] time amen the great combine will come
[1:02:34] along amen and it will take
[1:02:37] the seed
[1:02:40] into the garner
[1:02:43] and brother branham said there'll be a
[1:02:46] portion
[1:02:48] laid away for another purpose
[1:02:55] and the rest will be destroyed or burnt
[1:02:57] up
[1:02:59] all right
[1:03:01] and when we look at this another purpose
[1:03:03] when we come to the farmer
[1:03:07] this is the seed
[1:03:11] this is the reason he went through the
[1:03:13] whole process
[1:03:16] that's the reason he went through the
[1:03:17] entire process
[1:03:19] but god in his great thinking before the
[1:03:22] foundation of the world
[1:03:24] knew
[1:03:25] he put in place supports
[1:03:27] he put in place helps
[1:03:31] he put in place the three friends of lot
[1:03:33] that would come into confederation with
[1:03:35] him and help him go deliver or the three
[1:03:37] three friends of abraham i mean that
[1:03:38] would go with abraham to deliver law god
[1:03:40] put helps he put things in place amen
[1:03:43] that would help the seed come for his
[1:03:45] plan to come and and if that part that
[1:03:49] helps
[1:03:50] stays true to the life in the seed then
[1:03:54] it's laid aside for another purpose at
[1:03:56] the white throne judgment
[1:03:59] but if it ever pulls away or rejects the
[1:04:02] life that god was bringing back amen
[1:04:05] when it rejects that life it's rejected
[1:04:07] and it's burnt as the chaff
[1:04:10] so for us if you watch the combines go
[1:04:12] down the field and you have a wheat
[1:04:13] field the combine's going down the field
[1:04:15] and then all of a sudden you see at the
[1:04:17] top in the hopper all the wheat is
[1:04:19] piling up in the hopper amen but all the
[1:04:21] chaff and stuff is just getting shot out
[1:04:24] of the back of this combine amen and a
[1:04:26] lot of it's just blowing away a lot of
[1:04:28] the chaff and the dust and stuff is
[1:04:29] blowing away but that farmer will come
[1:04:32] back a few days later a few weeks later
[1:04:34] and he won't leave that straw laying
[1:04:36] there there's some value yet in that
[1:04:39] straw and that farmer will come back and
[1:04:41] bail that straw and use it for another
[1:04:44] purpose
[1:04:47] and because the straw was valuable to
[1:04:50] the life and never rejected the life it
[1:04:53] can have another purpose the other
[1:04:56] purpose is let's just put straw here
[1:05:00] so when we get to new heavens and new
[1:05:02] earth
[1:05:04] these are the ones who are outside the
[1:05:05] city
[1:05:09] and these are the ones
[1:05:11] i would say like this they are the city
[1:05:16] so
[1:05:18] that's why
[1:05:19] when god
[1:05:21] gives a judgment in the white throne
[1:05:23] judgment the judgment is matching what
[1:05:26] they did with life and the purpose that
[1:05:27] they served as the life was coming forth
[1:05:30] and if they serve that purpose without
[1:05:32] rejecting the life or turning away from
[1:05:34] it they're allowed to come in to a realm
[1:05:37] of eternal life not having eternal life
[1:05:40] because the only ones that have eternal
[1:05:41] life are the seed that's gathered to the
[1:05:43] garner
[1:05:44] the stalk doesn't already have eternal
[1:05:46] life amen it doesn't have what the seed
[1:05:49] has but it gets to go beyond time and
[1:05:53] have life beyond time and if you have
[1:05:55] life beyond time what kind of life is it
[1:05:58] because there's no more days there's no
[1:06:00] more months and
[1:06:01] there's no more time so they enter into
[1:06:03] eternal life they don't already have
[1:06:05] eternal life because if they had eternal
[1:06:07] life they would have the seed if they
[1:06:08] had the seed they'd have zoe life they
[1:06:10] had zoe life they'd be on the record of
[1:06:12] life or the lamb's book of life or the
[1:06:14] section in the book of life that's
[1:06:15] christ
[1:06:16] but they don't have that so they cannot
[1:06:18] be reborn so they don't have zoe life
[1:06:20] already so they must come up at the
[1:06:22] white throne judgment because they don't
[1:06:24] already have eternal life but at the
[1:06:26] white throne judgment based on how they
[1:06:28] did what they did with the life in their
[1:06:31] day determines if they get to go into
[1:06:33] eternal life or not
[1:06:36] so now the the stalk has a value has a
[1:06:40] purpose and so when when they were on
[1:06:42] earth it was a support to the life
[1:06:46] in some way it was a support to the life
[1:06:49] and because it supported the life in
[1:06:50] some way when you get the new heavens
[1:06:52] and new earth we talked about this
[1:06:54] several uh services ago when when you
[1:06:57] have the kings of the earth bring their
[1:07:00] honor and their glory into the city
[1:07:02] brother braham said they're bringing
[1:07:03] their tithes in their offering they're
[1:07:05] reaping the harvest from the land
[1:07:06] they're bringing tithe and offering into
[1:07:08] the city so what are they doing they are
[1:07:11] supporting the life of the city
[1:07:15] and because they support the life of the
[1:07:17] city they get to reach over and pluck
[1:07:19] off some leaves from the tree of life
[1:07:22] what is the tree of life the tree of
[1:07:24] life is bride and bridegroom restored
[1:07:26] back to one again the original tree of
[1:07:29] life from the garden of eden brought
[1:07:30] back in male and female through the
[1:07:32] process of time christ and his bride
[1:07:34] restored back in the city they are the
[1:07:36] tree of life brother branham said the
[1:07:38] believers are the leaves of the tree of
[1:07:39] life
[1:07:40] so because they bring their glory and
[1:07:42] honor into the city they get to pluck
[1:07:44] off a leaf and what is that it's life
[1:07:46] what is it it's an exchange
[1:07:50] what's being exchanged
[1:07:52] serving the life
[1:07:54] receiving life
[1:07:56] serving the life receiving life that's
[1:07:59] why the bible's written the way the
[1:08:01] bible's written that they bring their
[1:08:02] glory and honor into the city and they
[1:08:04] take the leaves for the healing of the
[1:08:05] nations why because they don't already
[1:08:08] have eternal life they receive perpetual
[1:08:11] life if i could just say it that way
[1:08:13] they receive perpetual life and in the
[1:08:15] new heavens and new earth is indicative
[1:08:17] of what they did to get that perpetual
[1:08:19] life
[1:08:21] and they keep doing it over and over and
[1:08:22] over again
[1:08:25] amen isn't god good
[1:08:28] this
[1:08:29] i'm telling you this these are not
[1:08:31] isolated doctrines these aren't neat
[1:08:33] cute doctrines they're not here to make
[1:08:34] us feel good this is the very nature of
[1:08:36] god the plan of god from before the
[1:08:37] foundation of the world
[1:08:40] and it is so perfectly expressed in the
[1:08:43] teaching that we have through this
[1:08:45] prophetic ministry
[1:08:47] that's why i said i said
[1:08:50] i don't know when i said i just said
[1:08:51] sometime that
[1:08:54] people start wanting to contradict the
[1:08:56] prophet of god and start to find faults
[1:08:58] with his birthday his birth record the
[1:09:00] way he told a story how many people fell
[1:09:02] off a bridge and all these other things
[1:09:04] once you catch the revelation of christ
[1:09:06] the mystery of god revealed and see the
[1:09:08] open book none of those things matter
[1:09:10] and i'm not saying it doesn't matter
[1:09:11] amen we believe everything the prophet
[1:09:13] said to be true but it doesn't matter to
[1:09:15] me if you can see a a conflict in an
[1:09:18] information if you can't get right date
[1:09:20] all of a sudden it's inconsequential to
[1:09:22] me because this is what i'm judging the
[1:09:24] message by
[1:09:26] not a record in a courthouse or an
[1:09:28] article in a newspaper or a a testimony
[1:09:31] or an eyewitness story none of that is
[1:09:33] basis for me to to receive this message
[1:09:36] this message is christ christ is the
[1:09:39] word so this and the message match
[1:09:41] perfectly they go like this
[1:09:44] so all of a sudden i'm no longer moved
[1:09:46] by a detail that doesn't match or some
[1:09:48] confusion in a record somewhere it
[1:09:50] doesn't matter to me because this record
[1:09:53] is perfect amen and when we saw the
[1:09:55] revelation of the unsealed book it was
[1:09:57] this book becoming unsealed and the
[1:09:59] message is christ the bible is christ
[1:10:02] the two come together and they paint a
[1:10:04] perfect picture of christ
[1:10:07] the doctrine is perfect
[1:10:12] here
[1:10:13] i'm just going to read a couple more
[1:10:14] quotes just to
[1:10:17] just to solidify what we're thinking
[1:10:18] about and then i want to get to the part
[1:10:19] that i've really been wanting to get to
[1:10:25] in the sardisian church age he said now
[1:10:27] let us go another step but before we do
[1:10:29] let us review our case thus far
[1:10:31] first of all we know most assuredly that
[1:10:34] the purpose of god stands an election
[1:10:37] it was purposed in himself it was god's
[1:10:39] purpose to bring forth a people like
[1:10:41] unto himself that would be a word bride
[1:10:44] she was chosen before the foundation of
[1:10:46] the world in him she was foreknown and
[1:10:48] beloved before she was ever brought
[1:10:49] forth during the ages upon the earth she
[1:10:52] was redeemed by his blood and can never
[1:10:54] come into condemnation she can never be
[1:10:56] in the judgment because sin cannot be
[1:10:58] imputed unto her
[1:11:01] i'll take that
[1:11:02] i'll say amen i'll raise my hand and
[1:11:04] i'll stand in line for that that's who i
[1:11:06] identify with that's what i believe
[1:11:10] romans 4 8 blessed is the man to whom
[1:11:11] the lord will not impute sin
[1:11:13] but indeed she shall be with him in his
[1:11:16] throne of judgment judging the world and
[1:11:17] even angels her name each of her members
[1:11:20] was written in a section of the lamb's
[1:11:22] book of life before the foundation of
[1:11:24] the world
[1:11:25] secondly there is another class their
[1:11:27] names are also in the book of life and
[1:11:29] they will come up in this in the second
[1:11:31] resurrection such are the foolish
[1:11:33] virgins and the righteous as we're
[1:11:35] spoken of in matthew 25.
[1:11:37] in this case also are those who do not
[1:11:40] worship the beast or become involved in
[1:11:42] the antichrist system but die for their
[1:11:44] faith even though they are not in the
[1:11:45] bride not having been born again
[1:11:49] they were in the bride they would have
[1:11:50] been born again
[1:11:51] because they're not in the bride they
[1:11:52] can't be born again
[1:11:54] but they will come up in the second
[1:11:55] resurrection and go into eternal life
[1:11:59] so
[1:12:00] we see very clearly that
[1:12:02] in non-seed there's nothing to quicken
[1:12:06] to be born again means there had to be a
[1:12:08] seed gene of eternal life from before
[1:12:10] the foundation of the world
[1:12:16] i want to read this quote
[1:12:19] and kind of lock this into our minds
[1:12:23] all these believers is we could go on
[1:12:24] for hours all these were like a bunch of
[1:12:26] change out of your pocket in god's hands
[1:12:29] you pull out a bunch of change there's
[1:12:31] pennies nickels dimes quarters half
[1:12:33] dollars dollars all in coins now that's
[1:12:35] what the world is in god's hand
[1:12:38] you got that
[1:12:39] that's what the world is in god's hand
[1:12:42] there are some people that just can have
[1:12:43] a pennies worth of it
[1:12:45] and god can only use them in a penny way
[1:12:49] that's all they can buy don't reject
[1:12:51] them if they can't believe the real
[1:12:52] truth don't turn them down he's not
[1:12:54] talking about bride now
[1:12:58] because bride can receive the real truth
[1:13:01] if they can't believe the real truth
[1:13:03] don't turn them down don't kick them out
[1:13:05] and say they're not in it because god
[1:13:07] uses pennies sometimes
[1:13:09] lot was just a penny abraham was a
[1:13:11] silver dollar
[1:13:13] so it taken 100 lots to make an abraham
[1:13:15] and so will it take a hundred carnal
[1:13:16] believers will never stand in the
[1:13:18] presence of a genuine christian that's
[1:13:19] separated from the carnal things of the
[1:13:21] world living in christ jesus where the
[1:13:23] world where the word can flow through
[1:13:25] him
[1:13:26] he can only take a penny's worth that's
[1:13:28] all he's got so you see people that say
[1:13:30] i don't believe in healing i don't
[1:13:31] believe in those things just know it's a
[1:13:33] penny but just let him alone see just a
[1:13:36] penny's worth and so that's all he can
[1:13:38] buy don't stop him just let him alone
[1:13:40] remember that's just all the farther he
[1:13:42] can go
[1:13:43] joseph he was separated from his
[1:13:44] brethren he says yay i didn't mean that
[1:13:47] hardly in that way that i said it i mean
[1:13:49] it if we will all belong to this and
[1:13:52] that what what we believe it's just a
[1:13:54] penny go ahead see just a penny
[1:13:57] well the lord bless you my brother say
[1:13:59] well bless you my brother
[1:14:01] see he's a copper he can never be silver
[1:14:03] you see so just let it go ahead god can
[1:14:06] use him
[1:14:08] oh he is using it i'd rather see him
[1:14:10] down here in the church than to see him
[1:14:12] in a bar room standing there on the
[1:14:13] corner wouldn't you sure so just let it
[1:14:16] alone god can use it anyhow maybe not
[1:14:18] very much but he'll use what he can use
[1:14:21] as much as they'll let him use
[1:14:25] i like this quote
[1:14:27] brother branham said there's some they
[1:14:29] can't receive the real truth they're
[1:14:30] just a pennies worth
[1:14:32] he said but don't reject them because
[1:14:34] sometimes god uses a penny said lot was
[1:14:37] a penny abraham was a silver daughter
[1:14:39] but remember lot amen lot was saved
[1:14:42] because of his association with abraham
[1:14:47] because god remembered abraham and he
[1:14:48] delivered law out of sodom
[1:14:50] but remember too lot with only a penny's
[1:14:53] worth amen couldn't take the full
[1:14:55] revelation of abraham but with a penny's
[1:14:57] worth amen he ran out of sodomy he was
[1:14:59] saved out of sodom he got into a
[1:15:01] situation with his daughters and they
[1:15:03] both became pregnant amen and the oldest
[1:15:05] one had a son named moab
[1:15:09] moab amen was a nation that god used
[1:15:12] they meant to test the children of
[1:15:14] israel
[1:15:15] in the wilderness so was god using
[1:15:17] lot
[1:15:20] and there's also a very famous woman
[1:15:22] that came out of moab named ruth
[1:15:28] so was god using lot and god using moab
[1:15:31] yes just let it alone
[1:15:34] god will work it out
[1:15:36] just keep preaching the truth standing
[1:15:38] for the truth if somebody else only got
[1:15:40] a penny worth don't fight them
[1:15:43] the disciples came to jesus in luke
[1:15:45] chapter 9 and said and john answered and
[1:15:47] said master we saw one casting out
[1:15:48] devils in thy name and we forbade him
[1:15:51] because he followeth not us
[1:15:53] and jesus said unto him forbid him not
[1:15:55] for he that is not against us is for us
[1:15:58] oh my goodness amen god has such a
[1:16:02] broader understanding amen before the
[1:16:04] foundation of the world he had he knew
[1:16:06] amen that to move the seat along to move
[1:16:09] the program along he had other
[1:16:11] individuals in place that would move the
[1:16:13] program along there was a lot amen there
[1:16:15] was a lot that would move the program
[1:16:17] along
[1:16:19] never would he be the seed
[1:16:21] but he would move the program along
[1:16:24] and so brother ben's telling us leave it
[1:16:26] alone don't fight it i mean we don't
[1:16:29] have to be out there picketing every
[1:16:31] church in the world and stop preaching
[1:16:33] your fault they can only get a pennies
[1:16:35] worth let them have a pennies worth
[1:16:37] because god amen listen god uses
[1:16:41] uh uh let me just demonstrate it this
[1:16:43] way brother benham tells us about the
[1:16:46] souls under the altar and
[1:16:48] in the
[1:16:49] fifth seal souls under the altar are
[1:16:52] jews amen and they're jews from the time
[1:16:54] of christ on that never received christ
[1:16:58] but they held true to the portion of the
[1:17:00] word that they had
[1:17:01] and they were persecuted for it and gave
[1:17:03] their lives for it
[1:17:04] they will receive a white robe at the
[1:17:06] white throne judgment and entrance into
[1:17:08] eternal life at the white throne
[1:17:09] judgment
[1:17:11] here's what brother bim said
[1:17:13] about them he said these are not born
[1:17:15] again ones with eternal life as their
[1:17:16] possession they came up in the
[1:17:18] resurrection and received life because
[1:17:20] of their stand on the word
[1:17:22] and notice how these are crying out for
[1:17:24] vengeance they cannot be bride material
[1:17:26] the bride turns to cheek in christ
[1:17:28] forgive them father they know not what
[1:17:29] they do these are jews they have to be
[1:17:31] because they're in the seal and it's in
[1:17:33] the foreseal that the gentile bride is
[1:17:35] gone in the rapture so these jews aren't
[1:17:37] born of his spirit they don't even
[1:17:40] believe that jesus is the messiah but as
[1:17:42] they were blinded by god for the gentile
[1:17:44] sake god gave them eternal life on the
[1:17:47] grounds
[1:17:48] and and though they could not come to
[1:17:50] him yet they were truly faithful to all
[1:17:53] the word they knew and died for it as
[1:17:55] multitudes died under hitler stalin etc
[1:17:57] and yet will die so because they held
[1:18:00] true to the fortune because they could
[1:18:02] not come to god because god rejected
[1:18:04] them now brother branham
[1:18:05] told us
[1:18:06] in the church age book i won't be able
[1:18:08] to find it right now but very
[1:18:10] specifically he says it doesn't mean
[1:18:12] that not all israel wasn't on from the
[1:18:15] time of christ on wasn't on the record
[1:18:17] of eternal life or the lamb's book of
[1:18:19] life he said they were and came into the
[1:18:22] gentile
[1:18:24] church so
[1:18:26] those jews who were part of that eternal
[1:18:30] life
[1:18:31] they received christ and came into the
[1:18:32] gentile church
[1:18:36] some of those fought christ and fought
[1:18:38] the church and had their names removed
[1:18:40] from the book of life
[1:18:43] but there were those like gamaliel
[1:18:47] and nicodemus
[1:18:49] who supported and helped and their names
[1:18:51] remained on the book of life even though
[1:18:53] they weren't part of the record of
[1:18:55] eternal life because the park the part
[1:18:57] of the jews that were the record of
[1:18:58] eternal life would come into the gentile
[1:19:00] church according to the prophet
[1:19:03] so
[1:19:04] in god's mind remember
[1:19:07] the the book was sealed before the
[1:19:09] foundation of the world is that right
[1:19:12] so in god's mind
[1:19:15] he has always had
[1:19:17] 144 000 jews
[1:19:20] to redeem under the seventh trumpet at
[1:19:22] the end of time
[1:19:23] he's always had it in his mind
[1:19:27] these
[1:19:29] are part of the seed
[1:19:31] these are elect
[1:19:34] and predestinated
[1:19:40] all right
[1:19:42] from the time of christ on the true jews
[1:19:44] that that had their name in the eternal
[1:19:46] life record they would come into the
[1:19:48] gentile church up until the time 144
[1:19:50] 000.
[1:19:52] but you had to have jews
[1:19:56] that would stay true
[1:20:02] to the word
[1:20:06] they had
[1:20:10] because somebody
[1:20:11] had to keep believing keeping the word
[1:20:14] keep believing bring them back to israel
[1:20:17] because there has to be a nation of
[1:20:18] israel in the end time there has to be a
[1:20:20] jewish people there has to be the 144
[1:20:23] thousand called out
[1:20:26] and when this group
[1:20:30] that would stay true
[1:20:33] and not reject not blasphemy not fight
[1:20:37] the bride
[1:20:39] they receive entrance
[1:20:43] into life
[1:20:45] they receive white robes
[1:20:47] why
[1:20:48] because god
[1:20:50] knew there was coming 144 thousand
[1:20:54] he blinded the nation of israel and
[1:20:55] turned to the gentiles those jews who
[1:20:58] were the remnant those jews who had
[1:21:00] their names in the lamb's book of life
[1:21:01] they would come into the gentile church
[1:21:04] but the jews who would stay true to the
[1:21:07] word and hold that word many jews didn't
[1:21:10] they became secular they became all
[1:21:11] kinds of stuff and they left the word
[1:21:13] but the ones who held true to the word
[1:21:15] god needed them to stay there as the
[1:21:17] stalk amen to hold the thing in place
[1:21:19] till he could come to time to reap the
[1:21:21] 144 thousand
[1:21:24] and because they stayed there like a
[1:21:26] stalk because they stayed there and
[1:21:28] stayed with what the portion they had
[1:21:30] they were blinded to the rest they could
[1:21:31] not see it god forbade that they would
[1:21:33] see it and would not open their eyes to
[1:21:35] see it and because he blinded them he's
[1:21:36] unjust and letting them stay with the
[1:21:38] portion they have if they'll stay as
[1:21:40] true as they can to the portion they had
[1:21:42] then god will give them life at the
[1:21:45] white throne judgment
[1:21:47] why
[1:21:49] it has to do with the seed because he's
[1:21:51] got to get the 144 thousand
[1:21:55] the same thing with the churches amen
[1:21:58] brother branham goes on the next
[1:22:00] paragraph he says it is the second
[1:22:02] resurrection where the five foolish
[1:22:03] virgins come up notice they were virgins
[1:22:06] they did not have the holy spirit so
[1:22:07] they missed being in the bride while the
[1:22:10] five wives who had oil became part of
[1:22:12] the bride but these people
[1:22:14] being a separate god-loving people and
[1:22:16] trying to abide in the word according to
[1:22:18] what they knew of it and being a help in
[1:22:20] the work of the lord will come up at the
[1:22:23] end of time
[1:22:25] and they will receive white robes at the
[1:22:27] white throne judgment what are they
[1:22:29] doing they're supporting they're holding
[1:22:31] true to the portion that the word they
[1:22:33] have as best they know and they're
[1:22:34] they're helping in the work of the lord
[1:22:36] how are they helping i don't know god
[1:22:38] will determine what kind of help they
[1:22:40] are
[1:22:42] but how many i mean how much how much
[1:22:46] freedom do we have now to spread the
[1:22:48] word because there's christian people in
[1:22:50] the land fighting for rights holding to
[1:22:53] what portion of truth that they have
[1:22:54] there's a group out there that is
[1:22:56] actually keeping keeping us preaching
[1:23:00] because there's not enough of us to keep
[1:23:02] the doors open
[1:23:05] there's such a minority if there was no
[1:23:07] christian nation if there was no
[1:23:09] christian people if there's no semblance
[1:23:11] of christian amen it would be very easy
[1:23:13] to come and shut the doors but god's had
[1:23:15] a voice going out for generations and
[1:23:17] generations and maybe some of those
[1:23:19] people are a help in the work of the
[1:23:21] lord by keeping the life moving forward
[1:23:23] by keeping a christian system in place
[1:23:26] that will allow the life to continue to
[1:23:28] move forward
[1:23:30] they never had it brother bam said they
[1:23:32] either never had a chance to hear the
[1:23:33] message or they sat in the meetings and
[1:23:35] it went over their heads or they were
[1:23:36] blinded by these false prophets
[1:23:40] they cannot fight the word
[1:23:42] they cannot come against the word that
[1:23:44] would make them antichrist
[1:23:47] but they either never heard it or went
[1:23:48] over their head or they were blinded by
[1:23:50] false prophets
[1:23:52] so when it comes to the white throne
[1:23:55] judgment brother man was always showing
[1:23:57] us the same thing he said then there's
[1:23:59] people amen who may never have even been
[1:24:02] christians going to a christian church
[1:24:04] but they've given life solely because
[1:24:06] they were good and kind and just to the
[1:24:07] brethren
[1:24:09] which are the elect of god that would
[1:24:10] support and help so anything that would
[1:24:13] support this life as it moved through
[1:24:15] and not fight against it can receive
[1:24:17] life at the white throne judgment
[1:24:20] everything that fights against this life
[1:24:23] to shut it down to blaspheme it to
[1:24:25] whatever it is stricken off the book of
[1:24:27] life and there's a great portion that
[1:24:29] never had their names on the book of
[1:24:31] life to begin with
[1:24:33] that's what brother branham says that's
[1:24:35] what the scripture says
[1:24:37] because all the world was deceived
[1:24:39] whose names were not found in them's
[1:24:41] book of
[1:24:43] so now we can see all of these
[1:24:46] categories we can see all of this coming
[1:24:48] up but when we realize i want to go back
[1:24:51] to a previous thought
[1:24:52] that that only the predestinated are
[1:24:55] considered in redemption
[1:24:58] so the whole plan
[1:24:59] the whole plan was for the seed of god
[1:25:02] to come forth and manifest in this day
[1:25:04] and season
[1:25:05] to express god that's the whole plan
[1:25:09] then anything else that god ordained to
[1:25:11] work with that plan and didn't fight
[1:25:13] against it it can receive life
[1:25:16] anything that was supposed to support it
[1:25:18] but rejected it will be rejected from
[1:25:20] life
[1:25:22] and now we understand the book of life
[1:25:25] it was all about the seed it was all
[1:25:28] about god's life
[1:25:29] coming forth that was the purpose of
[1:25:31] redemption that was the purpose of god's
[1:25:33] thought
[1:25:35] amen
[1:25:37] brother mum said in looking away looking
[1:25:39] unto jesus in 1964 that's the very
[1:25:42] reason that jesus was not understood
[1:25:43] when he came to earth if they would have
[1:25:46] only looked into the word of god instead
[1:25:48] of their tradition of that day they
[1:25:50] would have known that he was the son of
[1:25:52] god because the bible plainly declared
[1:25:54] his full coming and he come in full
[1:25:56] revelation of the word
[1:25:58] and each generation reveals him in the
[1:26:00] full revelation that's lotted for that
[1:26:02] time
[1:26:04] you get that wesley revealed him in the
[1:26:06] full revelation that was lauded for
[1:26:07] wesley's time not the full revelation
[1:26:09] the whole thing but the full revelation
[1:26:10] that was a lot of for luther's time for
[1:26:12] wesley's time for pentecostal time
[1:26:15] this
[1:26:16] and then it comes to this generation
[1:26:18] this generation must reveal jesus christ
[1:26:21] that's the revelation of him that's
[1:26:23] promised in the word must be revealed to
[1:26:25] this generation
[1:26:27] if the churches won't receive it
[1:26:28] somebody will rise up and do it because
[1:26:30] john said god is able to these stones to
[1:26:32] rise children unto abraham don't think
[1:26:34] to say within yourselves we have abraham
[1:26:36] to our father for god is able to these
[1:26:37] stones to rise children to abraham
[1:26:39] for what god has said god is fully able
[1:26:42] to perform what he has promised to do
[1:26:44] our father abraham
[1:26:47] our father abraham realized that and
[1:26:49] against hope he believed in hope and
[1:26:50] staggered not at the promise of god
[1:26:52] through unbelief but was strong giving
[1:26:55] praise to god because god
[1:26:58] god made him the promise he has made us
[1:27:00] a promise for this day he has made us a
[1:27:03] promise and our promise today is just as
[1:27:05] sure to be revealed as it was to abraham
[1:27:07] for we are the children of abraham being
[1:27:09] dead in christ we are abraham's seed and
[1:27:12] heirs with him according to the promise
[1:27:16] so what is a manifestation in this day
[1:27:18] it's to manifest jesus christ
[1:27:21] in the full measure of jesus christ
[1:27:23] manifest in bride form
[1:27:27] now i want to
[1:27:28] come and look at something here as we
[1:27:30] wind down
[1:27:31] and finish
[1:27:33] i want to go back
[1:27:36] and draw this line that i've been
[1:27:37] working with
[1:27:40] okay
[1:27:42] so
[1:27:44] here
[1:27:47] we're just going to write the mind of
[1:27:48] god
[1:27:49] now you can never be all-inclusive in a
[1:27:52] picture of something you write but but
[1:27:53] we're just doing the best we can just to
[1:27:55] get a visual understanding
[1:27:59] this mind of god
[1:28:01] these are god's thoughts and in god's
[1:28:03] thoughts
[1:28:04] in god's thoughts
[1:28:07] he thought this whole plan
[1:28:09] and the whole plan that he was thinking
[1:28:10] was christ the mystery of god revealed
[1:28:13] that was the thought that was the
[1:28:15] original plan it was christ the mystery
[1:28:17] of god revealed and in that plan his
[1:28:19] thoughts what he thought of expressing
[1:28:21] and he thought of attributes made flesh
[1:28:24] upon the earth manifesting himself in
[1:28:26] fellowship as a family when he thought
[1:28:28] of that he was thinking of of each one
[1:28:30] that would come forth in their season
[1:28:32] and express a certain part of the
[1:28:33] manifestation and bring it all the way
[1:28:35] down to a full measure amen of jesus
[1:28:37] christ because he was the lamb slain
[1:28:39] before the foundation of the world that
[1:28:40] would be the restoration of adam and
[1:28:42] then out of him would come the
[1:28:43] ingredients for his wife and then she
[1:28:45] would fall and then the restoration of
[1:28:46] the bride tree bringing it all the way
[1:28:48] back to a perfect union restoration back
[1:28:50] to the garden of eden god was thinking
[1:28:52] of all of this before the foundation of
[1:28:53] the world
[1:28:55] and he was thinking of this plan so that
[1:28:56] he could express himself express himself
[1:28:59] express himself so that when all these
[1:29:00] attributes come forth all these sons
[1:29:02] come forth they can have fellowship
[1:29:04] together as a family and they have
[1:29:06] fellowship because all the attributes
[1:29:08] understand god because god was expressed
[1:29:11] his nature
[1:29:12] who he was was expressed
[1:29:14] so
[1:29:16] in the mind of god
[1:29:19] when he had this thought
[1:29:22] this thought
[1:29:24] oh i'm just gonna do it like this i
[1:29:26] don't know any better way
[1:29:29] this thought
[1:29:33] became the book of life
[1:29:36] or it was
[1:29:38] it was the lamb's book of life from
[1:29:40] before the foundation of the world
[1:29:43] the lamb's book of life wasn't written
[1:29:47] after life come on the earth
[1:29:50] it was written before
[1:29:54] brother venom tells us this
[1:29:56] but we know uh i just quoted revelation
[1:29:58] 13 8
[1:30:00] that all that dwell upon the earth shall
[1:30:02] worship and whose names are not written
[1:30:03] in the book of life of the lamb slain
[1:30:05] from the foundation of the world
[1:30:07] so this book of life is from before the
[1:30:09] foundation of the world brother bam
[1:30:10] tells us in the first seal it says you
[1:30:12] see the book actually was planned and
[1:30:13] written before the foundation of the
[1:30:15] world
[1:30:16] all right we're on the same page
[1:30:18] this book was planned and written before
[1:30:20] the foundation of the world
[1:30:27] this book the bible was really written
[1:30:29] before the foundational world this book
[1:30:31] the bible
[1:30:33] i thought it was the
[1:30:35] i i thought we were talking about
[1:30:37] the book of life the lamb's book of life
[1:30:39] we are
[1:30:40] brother brethren just interchanged it
[1:30:41] with the bible
[1:30:43] are they interchangeable yes
[1:30:47] so i i'm not even going to write anymore
[1:30:50] the lamb's book of life
[1:30:52] is the bible the bible is a revelation
[1:30:54] of the lamb's book of life that's why
[1:30:56] when the seals came off the book of life
[1:30:58] the seals came off the bible
[1:31:02] it's the record of christ the mystery of
[1:31:03] god revealed it's the record of the
[1:31:05] eternal life coming down through the
[1:31:06] ages it's the record of the uh the seed
[1:31:08] the seed coming back to seed it's the
[1:31:10] record of all of that and god had this
[1:31:13] in his thinking before the foundation of
[1:31:14] the world and and the reason i'm
[1:31:16] explaining this way is i really want to
[1:31:18] get away from the concept the idea of a
[1:31:22] piece of paper
[1:31:25] because
[1:31:26] realize
[1:31:27] if it's a piece of paper then then then
[1:31:30] the
[1:31:31] the mighty angel came down in
[1:31:32] revelations 10 with an open book in his
[1:31:34] hand and he gave that open book to john
[1:31:36] and john ate it
[1:31:41] john ate the book
[1:31:42] where's the book in john
[1:31:45] did john eat paper
[1:31:47] no john received the revelation from the
[1:31:50] back part of god's mind
[1:31:52] that's why he had to go forth and
[1:31:54] prophesy again what was he prophesying
[1:31:56] christ the mystery of god revealed
[1:31:58] because now he caught amen the
[1:32:00] revelation of this sealed book amen
[1:32:02] that's been manifesting the seal book's
[1:32:05] been manifesting itself all the way down
[1:32:07] through but there's always been a
[1:32:08] mystery associated with it it's been
[1:32:10] shrouded in understanding who's in and
[1:32:12] who's not who's included and who's not
[1:32:13] included and how are they saved and all
[1:32:16] these other things now at the end of
[1:32:18] time the seals are taken off the book
[1:32:19] the mighty angel comes down with an open
[1:32:21] book in his hand and john takes and eats
[1:32:23] it john wasn't eating pieces of paper he
[1:32:26] was eating a spiritual revelation of
[1:32:28] what was contained in that book
[1:32:30] because i've eaten the same book
[1:32:33] but i ate the book and there's no less
[1:32:35] book for you to eat
[1:32:37] so we understand that this revelation is
[1:32:39] a book of symbols amen and so we get
[1:32:42] caught up as and you know we get caught
[1:32:44] up in ideas but remember the symbols are
[1:32:46] just to help us understand something we
[1:32:48] don't want to get fixated on a symbol
[1:32:50] that where if i get to heaven and i
[1:32:52] don't see a giant scroll with a huge
[1:32:54] less than names and that scroll rolls
[1:32:56] down and down the floor and off the
[1:32:58] clouds of heaven and down across the
[1:33:00] earth with all these names that are
[1:33:01] written in it i'm going to be like this
[1:33:03] isn't right
[1:33:08] do you understand what i'm saying
[1:33:12] god wrote this book
[1:33:15] before the foundation of the world
[1:33:17] that means god wrote this book before he
[1:33:19] made paper
[1:33:23] before he had animal skins
[1:33:27] are we understanding now
[1:33:30] brother brenham said let's not be
[1:33:31] children
[1:33:33] let's be full-grown adults let's be the
[1:33:35] bride of jesus christ
[1:33:37] this lamb's book of life was the
[1:33:39] original thought god had
[1:33:41] of how he was going to express himself
[1:33:43] and become a family upon the earth
[1:33:46] which is christ and mystery that was the
[1:33:48] mystery of god
[1:33:49] islam's book of life
[1:33:51] he knew how he was going to do it he
[1:33:53] knew who would help he knew who would
[1:33:54] receive a reward for helping
[1:33:57] he knew who would fight against it he
[1:33:58] knew who he would raise up who didn't
[1:34:00] even have their name in the book of life
[1:34:02] who he would raise up like pharaoh
[1:34:06] to fight against it so he can get glory
[1:34:08] from him
[1:34:09] he had a plan and that plan was so he
[1:34:12] could express himself
[1:34:15] and when we come down
[1:34:18] that expression began to manifest
[1:34:21] and when it come down to adam
[1:34:26] the book
[1:34:27] came to adam
[1:34:31] because brother branham tells us adam
[1:34:33] lost
[1:34:34] the title deed of redemption
[1:34:38] so that means adam had the book
[1:34:41] so the prophet tells us
[1:34:44] how did adam have the book was he
[1:34:47] walking around in the garden
[1:34:49] this
[1:34:51] eve try one of these these are really
[1:34:52] good oh i'm sorry i'll put it over here
[1:34:55] no it's a little higher here hold my
[1:34:56] book
[1:34:59] brother bram told us adam had the title
[1:35:00] deed
[1:35:01] but he lost it in the fall when it went
[1:35:03] back to the hands of god and there we
[1:35:05] find it in revelation chapter 5.
[1:35:07] it wasn't this that he was carrying
[1:35:10] what he was carrying was the mystery of
[1:35:12] the plan of god which was in adam
[1:35:15] because if adam would have reproduced
[1:35:17] the correct way he would have brought
[1:35:19] forth another seed of god
[1:35:21] he would have brought forth christ
[1:35:26] what was it it was the lamb's book of
[1:35:28] life in adam
[1:35:31] the mystery it was still a sealed book
[1:35:33] remember the seals don't open till the
[1:35:34] end of time it was still a sealed book
[1:35:38] right
[1:35:38] and it was still sealed but adam had the
[1:35:41] sealed book he had the title deed of all
[1:35:43] redemption the lamb's book of life he
[1:35:45] adam had it amen but adam lost it when
[1:35:48] he fell because when adam fell he fell
[1:35:51] by hybridization and now not every
[1:35:53] product was going to be a child of god a
[1:35:55] sea gene of god so that book had to go
[1:35:58] bad because he lost the mystery because
[1:36:00] if he would have come forth if he would
[1:36:02] have produced a son the right way amen
[1:36:04] that son would have been christ
[1:36:07] and his name would have probably been
[1:36:09] seth or abel
[1:36:11] and then the next one probably would
[1:36:13] have been seth and one of them would
[1:36:14] have been chad
[1:36:18] understand it would have been the
[1:36:19] eternal life record coming forth coming
[1:36:21] forth coming forth but that book was
[1:36:23] sealed there was a mystery about that
[1:36:25] book adam had it but when adam when adam
[1:36:29] come into a hybrid condition and adam
[1:36:31] used sexual desire for reproduction amen
[1:36:34] all of a sudden that book goes back to
[1:36:36] god
[1:36:38] so it wasn't adam walking around with
[1:36:40] the book the mystery was in adam
[1:36:44] but we know adam had to fall he had to
[1:36:47] lose the title deed i mean he could no
[1:36:49] longer be a god over the earth it had to
[1:36:51] fall into ruin because it had to produce
[1:36:53] all of these things and there was other
[1:36:54] names to be expressed in the book of
[1:36:56] life and we understand all of that so
[1:36:58] now now the book
[1:37:02] goes back
[1:37:05] to god
[1:37:07] but guess what god doesn't want this
[1:37:09] book
[1:37:12] god gave the book to man because god
[1:37:15] wants this mystery he wants himself to
[1:37:18] be expressed in flesh upon the earth as
[1:37:21] a family in fellowship
[1:37:24] so god's desire is not to hold the book
[1:37:26] this book is this book is his attributes
[1:37:30] coming forth this book is himself
[1:37:33] becoming tangible this book is him
[1:37:36] moving through mankind moving into flesh
[1:37:38] so that he could be filled this book is
[1:37:41] the plan of god coming as a mini-member
[1:37:45] body and coming as his own son and
[1:37:48] coming as his son's wife uniting the two
[1:37:50] back together in fellowship so that god
[1:37:52] could commune with his family upon the
[1:37:54] earth
[1:37:57] that's the book friends that's the
[1:37:58] mystery of the book amen that's what the
[1:38:01] book was written for and god had it was
[1:38:03] a mystery and all down through it was it
[1:38:06] was mysterious and who's included and
[1:38:08] who's not and how are they saved and how
[1:38:10] are they not saved
[1:38:13] are they rejected are they accepted are
[1:38:15] they
[1:38:18] how
[1:38:19] how
[1:38:20] could
[1:38:21] how
[1:38:24] how could job be saved
[1:38:27] before the law
[1:38:31] amen
[1:38:33] because the law was to bring them into
[1:38:35] perfection how could job be saved before
[1:38:37] the law
[1:38:39] amen how could abraham receive the
[1:38:41] promise before circumcision
[1:38:43] but yet now without circumcision you're
[1:38:45] outside the promise
[1:38:47] because god is moving himself down in
[1:38:49] manifestation and unlocking and
[1:38:51] unfolding and revealing more and more of
[1:38:54] the mystery that's in the book
[1:38:59] when
[1:39:01] we come to calvary
[1:39:06] when jesus christ was here
[1:39:09] he was the book
[1:39:12] because he is the book
[1:39:15] all of the book was in him
[1:39:20] it was still a mystery he was the
[1:39:21] revelation of the mystery of the old
[1:39:23] testament so the mystery of this well
[1:39:26] the mystery of this
[1:39:28] was here
[1:39:31] and the book was in him
[1:39:34] is that right
[1:39:35] how do you know the book was in him
[1:39:36] because brother man said i was in him
[1:39:38] and i'm in that book
[1:39:40] the book was in him and he was dying
[1:39:43] amen and shedding his blood to redeem
[1:39:45] back the names that were in that book
[1:39:49] and now we come to the end of
[1:39:52] time and in the seventh age
[1:39:56] there comes a prophet on the scene
[1:39:59] and now christ
[1:40:01] is going to open this book
[1:40:04] and he is going to bring the book down
[1:40:10] christ because christ is the book and
[1:40:12] he's the seals that was revealed
[1:40:15] that's why when you have the open book
[1:40:16] you have christ
[1:40:18] that's why to say that the seals are
[1:40:21] to say that the seals are open and
[1:40:23] christ hasn't come is the
[1:40:25] misunderstanding what the seals were and
[1:40:27] what the book is the book is christ it's
[1:40:30] the record of christ christ is the book
[1:40:32] he is those seals and what are the
[1:40:33] believers the word in the book so when
[1:40:35] the revelation of the book come down
[1:40:38] that's why when the book come down the
[1:40:40] full life of christ come down because
[1:40:42] they're one and the same
[1:40:46] so now
[1:40:47] the the
[1:40:50] the book has come down in the hands of
[1:40:52] the angel in revelation chapter 10 and
[1:40:54] the book's been opened amen because now
[1:40:56] brother branham can come and he can
[1:40:58] preach the seals and preach christ as
[1:40:59] the mystery of god revealed christ is
[1:41:01] the mystery god revealed is the open
[1:41:03] book
[1:41:05] and so now he's talking about the great
[1:41:07] plan that god had one thing he wanted to
[1:41:09] achieve one goal that he had and
[1:41:11] everything in the bible has been
[1:41:12] pointing to this one achievement and so
[1:41:14] now the lamb's book of life is opened by
[1:41:17] the lamb he's the only one that's worthy
[1:41:19] to open it he's the only one that can
[1:41:21] open it and john when he sees the cry
[1:41:23] come at the end of time after the church
[1:41:26] ages he hears a cry says who will come
[1:41:29] and open the book and nobody's found
[1:41:30] worthy and john begins to weep because
[1:41:33] john realizes if nobody's worthy
[1:41:35] everything in that book is lost
[1:41:39] and john knew he was in that book and
[1:41:42] john realizes everything all of creation
[1:41:45] and everything in that book is lost if
[1:41:47] nobody can come and take four take take
[1:41:48] the book amen that's why you and i and
[1:41:51] we stand here at the end of time amen
[1:41:53] the seventh angel's already been here
[1:41:55] he's already come and gone and this book
[1:41:57] has to be open and the seals have to be
[1:41:59] revealed at the time of that seventh
[1:42:00] angel and if that book was not open and
[1:42:03] christ did not come down with the open
[1:42:04] book during the life of william branham
[1:42:07] amen then everything is lost
[1:42:12] it is our only hope amen but this is why
[1:42:16] we shouldn't be weeping like john amen
[1:42:18] because we saw him come forth and take
[1:42:20] the book and open the seals and we
[1:42:22] understood it one night after another
[1:42:24] after another after another when he
[1:42:26] would come and bring the revelation to
[1:42:28] those seals what was it the lamb opening
[1:42:30] the book what was opening the book
[1:42:32] revealing the seals what was revealing
[1:42:34] the seals revealing christ
[1:42:39] amen and because of that we should be
[1:42:41] like john amen all heaven and all on
[1:42:44] earth and all under there heard me
[1:42:46] rejoicing amen saying
[1:42:49] worthy and honor and praise be unto him
[1:42:51] that sitteth on the throne
[1:42:55] he come and he took the book amen so
[1:42:57] when he took the book brother bam uses
[1:42:59] all kinds of terminology tore off the
[1:43:00] seals he threw them down through the
[1:43:02] seven church mister he gave him to the
[1:43:04] to the to the bride to the church uh he
[1:43:06] come down with open book and there's all
[1:43:08] ways to describe this but it's all one
[1:43:10] in the self same thing amen if you get
[1:43:13] the open book you get christ
[1:43:18] if there's no more seals on the book
[1:43:21] then christ is here in full measure
[1:43:24] what was keeping christ from the people
[1:43:27] what was keeping christ from the people
[1:43:28] was the denominational change that had
[1:43:30] the holy ghost bound for nearly 2 000
[1:43:33] years but in the evening time is loose
[1:43:35] by the evening time message the holy
[1:43:37] ghost back in the people again
[1:43:40] what's the holy ghost the life of that
[1:43:42] word
[1:43:44] the life that was in christ amen now
[1:43:46] coming back into the church when's it
[1:43:48] coming back into the church at the
[1:43:49] opening of the seals because at the
[1:43:51] opening of the seals is the fullness of
[1:43:53] christ unveiled here presence
[1:43:59] and then the voice from heaven tells
[1:44:01] john
[1:44:02] go and take that book
[1:44:04] out of the hand
[1:44:06] of the angel
[1:44:08] and eat it all
[1:44:11] john ate all the book
[1:44:13] but there's still all of the book left
[1:44:15] for you to eat
[1:44:17] i want to eat all the book but if i eat
[1:44:19] all the book there's still book left
[1:44:20] over for you
[1:44:22] what kind of book is this this book is
[1:44:24] christ what's eating the book amen
[1:44:27] eating the book is receiving the
[1:44:28] revelation of christ feeding on the body
[1:44:30] word of the son of man eating the manna
[1:44:32] that came down from heaven eating the
[1:44:34] book is receiving christ and that's why
[1:44:37] john would now go and prophesy again
[1:44:40] amen why what is the spirit of prophecy
[1:44:43] according to revelation the spirit of
[1:44:44] prophecy is the testimony of jesus
[1:44:47] christ
[1:44:48] and christ is the mystery of god
[1:44:50] revealed who has that testimony the
[1:44:52] bride because she's eaten the book
[1:44:56] and now the book that was in god's mind
[1:44:59] amen the book that adam was carrying
[1:45:04] that adam lost and went back to god that
[1:45:07] god's been holding
[1:45:10] when adam was carrying it it was sealed
[1:45:14] right is that right
[1:45:16] that book now came and became flesh
[1:45:19] in christ jesus
[1:45:21] and that book was sealed
[1:45:25] so the book has been on earth before
[1:45:31] the book was on earth in adam
[1:45:35] the book was on earth in christ
[1:45:38] but both times that book was sealed
[1:45:41] but the end time is the first time that
[1:45:44] that book's coming back to earth only
[1:45:46] this time that book's not sealed
[1:45:48] now who's redeemed who's included
[1:45:50] redemption who's in the wreck of eternal
[1:45:52] life who gets life at the white throne
[1:45:54] judgment what god has been doing all
[1:45:56] down through god's threefold purpose how
[1:45:58] he's been unfolding it through time it's
[1:45:59] all unsealed the book is now here and
[1:46:02] it's come back there was a restored adam
[1:46:05] who had the book but when adam was
[1:46:06] restored it was a sealed book hey but
[1:46:08] now when it's time for the manifestation
[1:46:10] of the bride to come forth now that last
[1:46:13] adam is going to open the seals and give
[1:46:15] him to his bride amen and now they're
[1:46:17] coming back together as one she's taking
[1:46:19] the book inside of her and now the book
[1:46:21] is in her because the word is in the
[1:46:24] bride
[1:46:29] you see for 50 years we're thinking
[1:46:32] about book where's the book the books we
[1:46:33] don't even understand what the book is
[1:46:37] the book is
[1:46:38] christ it's the very plan of god to
[1:46:41] manifest himself and become tangible in
[1:46:44] the earth and come into fellowship as a
[1:46:45] family that's the book
[1:46:49] it was in adam adam lost it because of
[1:46:52] the fall it was in christ christ
[1:46:54] redeemed it back but it was still a
[1:46:55] sealed book
[1:47:00] but he said the book was in the hand of
[1:47:02] god christ has been sitting in the hand
[1:47:04] of god
[1:47:09] christ is the book
[1:47:11] he is the word
[1:47:13] man manifest
[1:47:14] he is the unsealed word
[1:47:17] it's christ
[1:47:19] and that book
[1:47:21] has returned back to earth again
[1:47:25] and that book is to be eaten
[1:47:27] by a select group of people
[1:47:30] who can go to the angel
[1:47:32] and say give me the book
[1:47:37] how is it that you can go to the angel
[1:47:39] and say give me the book
[1:47:41] because under abraham's covenant i'm an
[1:47:44] heir of the world
[1:47:46] amen
[1:47:48] is that what paul tells us
[1:47:51] he tells us that under abraham's
[1:47:53] covenant i'm an heir of the world and
[1:47:55] i'm a joint heir with christ
[1:47:59] and that's the title deed of redemption
[1:48:02] that was redeemed back from me by my
[1:48:03] husband
[1:48:05] but i was also part of that
[1:48:08] redemption
[1:48:10] because i was there
[1:48:12] and now i'm a joint heir with christ and
[1:48:13] now in this manifestation i can go to
[1:48:16] the angels and say give me that book
[1:48:18] give me the revelation open my eyes let
[1:48:21] me see let me feed on you my husband let
[1:48:23] me take you in all of you into me
[1:48:27] and now the book
[1:48:29] that's been moving so much all the way
[1:48:32] through from the mind of god to adam
[1:48:34] from adam back to god manifesting christ
[1:48:37] christ going back to the right hand of
[1:48:39] the father coming all the way down
[1:48:40] through till it's time for the lamb to
[1:48:42] open the book and loose the seals and
[1:48:44] now a book that has been sealed in god's
[1:48:46] mind
[1:48:48] all the way down through is now an
[1:48:50] unsealed book
[1:48:53] to you and i
[1:48:55] and god is asking us to eat this
[1:48:59] and book
[1:48:59] prophesy again
[1:49:02] what is you oh what are we going to
[1:49:03] prophesy
[1:49:05] the spirit of prophecy
[1:49:07] the testimony
[1:49:08] of jesus christ
[1:49:11] amen let's all stand i've got so many
[1:49:15] quotes and so many scriptures that i
[1:49:16] just
[1:49:17] didn't read but i'm going to read this
[1:49:18] last one as the musicians come
[1:49:21] let's go to isaiah 55.
[1:49:29] i hope this revelation is setting your
[1:49:31] heart on fire
[1:49:33] i hope it's causing us to realize who we
[1:49:35] are and how secure we are what day that
[1:49:38] we actually live in
[1:49:40] will there be another age no there won't
[1:49:42] be another age
[1:49:43] there's nothing left
[1:49:45] we're here
[1:49:47] remember remember when when abraham was
[1:49:50] given the promise abraham was given the
[1:49:52] promise this is your land
[1:49:55] he said this is all your land i have
[1:49:57] given it to you that was now all
[1:49:59] abraham's land
[1:50:01] is that right
[1:50:03] so
[1:50:04] that belonged to abraham it was all his
[1:50:07] and he said walk in it walk in the land
[1:50:09] and see it he could see it he could walk
[1:50:11] in it he could live in it it was all his
[1:50:15] but when he needed a place to bury his
[1:50:17] wife he had to go and buy a cave
[1:50:20] because although god had given it to him
[1:50:22] in the dispensation time and
[1:50:24] manifestation he did not come fully into
[1:50:26] his possession that'll happen in the
[1:50:28] exodus journey when they return and
[1:50:29] drive out the inhabitants
[1:50:31] so it was his land god gave it to him
[1:50:34] and said i've given this to you and to
[1:50:36] your seed forever that was abraham's
[1:50:38] land abraham's property but in the
[1:50:40] dispensation of time abraham would have
[1:50:42] to pay money to buy a cave to bury his
[1:50:45] wives
[1:50:46] but when his seed would come in later
[1:50:48] amen it was theirs because god had given
[1:50:51] to them now because god told them to
[1:50:52] they can drive out the inhabitants and
[1:50:54] they don't have to pay anything for that
[1:50:55] cave
[1:50:59] that's why this land has been restored
[1:51:01] to us everything has been given back to
[1:51:03] us it's all ours
[1:51:05] i am already glorified
[1:51:08] i've been chosen i've been called i've
[1:51:10] been sanctified i am already glorified
[1:51:15] i am already raptured
[1:51:17] i have been resurrected from dead
[1:51:19] denomination i have been caught up to
[1:51:20] meet him i've been seated in heavenly
[1:51:22] places in christ jesus for over 2000
[1:51:25] years
[1:51:26] or almost 2 000 years
[1:51:29] but in the dispensation of time god's
[1:51:32] allowing us to act out the final scenes
[1:51:34] of the drama we're not able just to go
[1:51:36] and take it yet amen materially it's
[1:51:39] coming it's coming it's coming but and
[1:51:42] spiritually it's all ours amen we're
[1:51:44] walking in the land we're seeing it amen
[1:51:47] can you see it and can you walk in it
[1:51:50] can you see the full redemption and the
[1:51:52] full blessing the restored back to eden
[1:51:54] can you see the full word coming back
[1:51:56] can you see it can you touch it can you
[1:51:58] camp by the river can you smell the
[1:52:00] fresh air and can you know that it's all
[1:52:02] yours
[1:52:05] abraham didn't doubt it was his even
[1:52:07] when he had to pay money
[1:52:09] he just knew he was waiting for the rest
[1:52:11] of the story to unfold on earth but it
[1:52:13] was already
[1:52:14] his and when we go through the things we
[1:52:17] go through it doesn't change anything
[1:52:18] about the promise it doesn't change
[1:52:19] anything about the reality
[1:52:22] we've become heirs of the whole world
[1:52:24] joint heirs with christ christ is here
[1:52:26] among us this bride is the manifestation
[1:52:28] of jesus christ on this earth in full
[1:52:29] measure she has eaten the book and she
[1:52:31] is called to prophesy again
[1:52:34] if you've got to pay for a cave or a
[1:52:36] broke down car it don't matter
[1:52:39] walk in the land and see it for it's all
[1:52:42] been given to us
[1:52:45] we should be happy people
[1:52:47] we're just waiting for god to finish the
[1:52:50] manifestation as he wants to finish the
[1:52:52] manifestation
[1:52:53] but it's already our possession
[1:52:57] we're already
[1:52:59] walking in it
[1:53:00] let's read isaiah 55
[1:53:03] and verse 11
[1:53:08] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[1:53:10] of my mouth it shall not return unto me
[1:53:13] void
[1:53:14] but it shall accomplish that which i
[1:53:16] please and it shall prosper in the thing
[1:53:18] whereto
[1:53:19] i sent it
[1:53:21] god sent out his word from his mind
[1:53:25] and that word's been coming down
[1:53:28] and that word come out of god his mind
[1:53:30] the logos and the logos come out and
[1:53:32] there's been a manifestation down
[1:53:34] through time and the book has been
[1:53:35] traveling down amen the revealing of
[1:53:38] that what the contents of that book has
[1:53:39] been traveling down amen but it won't be
[1:53:42] too much longer until all the word will
[1:53:45] return to him but it will not return
[1:53:47] void for all the word that came from him
[1:53:49] will accomplish the purpose that he sent
[1:53:51] it out for
[1:53:53] and that's why you and i are here to
[1:53:54] accomplish the purpose he sent us out
[1:53:56] for
[1:53:57] and we come from heaven to serve god's
[1:53:59] purpose
[1:54:01] and we will go back
[1:54:02] victorious
[1:54:04] because it was sealed in his mind before
[1:54:06] the foundation of the world nobody could
[1:54:09] change it
[1:54:11] you say it was a sealed book listen
[1:54:13] these are all terms and symbology for
[1:54:15] understanding what it means in a sealed
[1:54:17] book it was immutable unchangeable the
[1:54:19] mind of god that nobody could get into
[1:54:21] and tamper with
[1:54:24] it was sealed in the mind of god but it
[1:54:25] wasn't sealed away from the thinking of
[1:54:27] god
