[10:04] praise God it's an exciting time amen
[10:08] I've been looking forward to this we
[10:09] tried to have brother Daniel come last
[10:11] year but with all the restrictions and
[10:13] the borders and all the things it was
[10:15] not possible
[10:16] but God opened the door and made a way
[10:18] but it hasn't been easy as a brother he
[10:21] sure had his challenges amen I found out
[10:24] yesterday that his Visa was held up as
[10:26] he's traveling through Canada he needed
[10:28] a Canadian visa he didn't get it till he
[10:31] got to the airport to fly out
[10:33] I said brother I'm glad I didn't know
[10:35] that
[10:37] then when they got here
[10:39] the they were in Toronto to come into
[10:41] the United States they got to cross
[10:43] through customs U.S customs in Toronto
[10:46] U.S customs literally shut the door in
[10:49] their face 8 30 were closed in your in
[10:52] their face
[10:53] and I told him I said I'm ashamed of
[10:55] America
[10:56] so ashamed they had to stay another
[10:58] night travel through Washington DC come
[11:00] back then when they landed they lost
[11:03] three pieces of their luggage which they
[11:05] just recovered this afternoon
[11:07] when they told me all of that I said
[11:08] brother I can't wait to hear what God
[11:10] has in store for us because that's a
[11:13] whole pile of resistance but you know
[11:16] through it all God is good amen
[11:19] and you can't ever blame the devil for
[11:22] trying
[11:23] that's what he's supposed to do but I
[11:25] thank God God always makes a way through
[11:28] every obstacle and here we are tonight
[11:30] amen I'm thankful
[11:33] and let's stand together and we'll
[11:34] invite brother Daniel to come
[11:36] take his Liberty and may may we pull to
[11:40] the point that he can relax
[11:42] and rest and let God use the channel the
[11:44] gift to minister to our hearts rather
[11:48] Jesus
[11:50] we just want to thank you
[11:56] yeah

[12:04] you

[12:35] you we came out on
[12:38] LOL
[12:40] well greetings from Australia it's uh
[12:43] quite a ways over here but it's a real
[12:45] honor and privilege to be here with you

[12:49] we just feel like royalty we're being
[12:52] treated like royalty we want to thank

[13:05] of the family we'd just like to thank

[13:10] was the best crew that I could bring so
[13:13] it's uh they feel very honored also to
[13:16] be here with you and it had certainly
[13:18] been a struggle to get here but we
[13:20] understand if God has a plan and
[13:23] Satan knows that plan he tries to
[13:25] interrupt it you know that's okay to us
[13:28] it's it's no big in fact it encourages
[13:31] us when uh when these things happen
[13:33] Satan don't understand it because he
[13:36] does it to discourage us but it becomes
[13:38] an encouragement
[13:40] so uh we thank the Lord that we're here
[13:42] we may have been here a little late we
[13:44] may have not had all our luggage but
[13:46] we're here safe and we know that we're
[13:48] in the will of God being here and we
[13:50] trust that the services will be a
[13:52] blessing to you all and uh not coming to
[13:56] minister anything wild and new or just
[13:59] coming to be a blessing and Minister

[16:25] we want the Lord to be the preeminent
[16:27] one
[16:28] uh amongst us we may have our thoughts
[16:31] and our ideas
[16:36] but um praise God he he's got all things

[16:41] amen Joel chapter 2 verse 20 23
[16:51] be glad then ye children of Zion and

[17:07] rain in the first month
[17:09] and the flaws shall be full of Wheat and
[17:12] the fats shall overflow with wine and
[17:15] oil
[17:16] and I will restore unto you the years
[17:19] that the locusts hath eaten the canker
[17:21] worm the caterpillar and the Palmer worm
[17:24] my great Army which I sent among you
[17:29] amen if we could turn to the Book of
[17:32] John
[17:35] thought tonight is that the restoration
[17:37] of true worship the restoration of true
[17:41] worship
[17:43] John chapter 4
[17:49] verse 19.
[17:55] we're just cutting into this story here
[17:57] but I think we know it well enough
[17:59] woman at the well the woman saith unto
[18:01] him sir I perceive that thou art a
[18:04] prophet
[18:05] our fathers worshiped in this mountain
[18:10] and ye say that in Jerusalem is the
[18:13] place where men ought to worship
[18:17] in Jesus saith unto her woman believe me
[18:20] the hour cometh when ye shall neither in
[18:23] this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem
[18:27] worship the father
[18:30] ye worship ye know not what we know what
[18:34] we worship for salvation is of the Jews
[18:38] but the hour Commerce and now is I just
[18:42] want to pay attention to that verse 23 I
[18:44] believe that the hour cometh is speaking
[18:47] of this time in which we are living in
[18:48] now
[18:49] the hour cometh and now is when the true
[18:53] worshiper
[18:54] shall worship the father in spirit and
[18:57] in truth
[18:59] for the father seeketh
[19:01] such to worship Him
[19:04] God is a spirit and they that worship
[19:07] Him must worship Him in spirit
[19:10] and in truth amen amen I've got
[19:15] Revelations 21 here but I'm just going
[19:17] to change that we're going to go to the
[19:18] Book of Genesis
[19:20] chapter 22
[19:28] Genesis 22 we're going to look at this
[19:31] story tonight
[19:36] Genesis 22
[19:39] verse 5.
[19:41] foreign
[19:44] and Abraham said unto thee to his young
[19:47] men abide ye here with the ass and I and
[19:52] the lad will go Yonder and worship
[19:56] and come again unto you
[19:59] amen let's bear our hearts tonight our
[20:01] heavenly father
[20:03] Lord it certainly is a privilege and
[20:05] honor Lord to be in service for you
[20:08] Lord Jesus we just dedicate ourselves to
[20:11] this very moment Lord this very hour and
[20:14] in which you have allowed us to be here
[20:16] on this Earth Lord
[20:18] Lord may you do the impossible in our
[20:21] lives Lord
[20:22] may you do Lord for us Heavenly Father
[20:25] perhaps what we've tried to do for
[20:27] ourself for so long and yet Lord the
[20:29] things that are impossible for us to do
[20:31] in our own lives Lord God are possible
[20:34] for you
[20:35] Lord there is nothing too hard for you
[20:37] there is nothing that you cannot achieve
[20:39] Lord there's there's nothing that cannot
[20:42] be done heavenly father so Lord we just
[20:45] dedicate this time to your hands Lord we
[20:48] dedicate ourselves into your hands
[20:50] heavenly father that you Lord God might
[20:53] achieve Lord God what you had ordained
[20:56] to achieve before the foundation of the
[20:59] world through this night Lord God Bless
[21:02] the people that are here Lord we pray in
[21:05] Jesus Christ's precious name amen
[21:09] amen God bless you you can take your
[21:11] seats tonight
[21:13] amen so like I was saying there the the
[21:17] thought here is the the restoration of
[21:20] true worship and as a as a subtitle here
[21:23] I've got the the Lord's desire for you
[21:27] we see here in the Book of John
[21:30] uh chapter four
[21:32] Jesus is saying here but the hour cometh
[21:35] and now is when the true worshiper shall
[21:37] worship the father in spirit and in
[21:40] truth so we understand that that is thus
[21:43] saith the Lord we understand that that
[21:45] there is no question whether that is
[21:47] going to come to pass or not come to
[21:49] pass we understand that this is going to
[21:52] come to pass but I believe that who this
[21:56] is going to come to pass who who is God
[21:59] going to give this it says the hour
[22:01] comethan now is when the worshiper who
[22:05] who are those worshipers because I
[22:08] believe that those worshipers God has
[22:10] ordained worshipers to be here in this
[22:13] hour not just to worship him but to
[22:16] worship Him in spirit and in truth amen
[22:21] I love this last part of this verse 23
[22:23] for that father seeketh such to worship
[22:28] Him amen for the father seeketh such to
[22:33] worship him it's not some a place it's
[22:36] not a thing that we can do of ourself
[22:39] but it's so it's God's desire for you
[22:43] amen we understand that this within
[22:46] Fellowship today this come up a few
[22:48] times that we are not looking for a
[22:51] church experience we are not looking for
[22:53] a church walk we are not even looking
[22:56] for a family experience or a family walk
[22:59] we are not looking as a husband and wife
[23:02] walk we are looking at at a walk that
[23:05] God wants with us individually behold I
[23:09] send you amen not a group but the
[23:12] individual behold I send you the prophet
[23:16] of God says in the in the writing to the
[23:19] late I see in church age to him that
[23:22] overcome us he said that is not a church
[23:24] that is not a group that is not a family
[23:27] that is an individual amen that is an
[23:31] individual so God's desire for you as an
[23:36] individual is to worship Him in spirit
[23:40] and in truth amen and and whether we
[23:46] we understand that's my desire
[23:50] I desire to worship Him in spirit and in
[23:54] truth
[23:54] amen I I believe that the true worshiper
[23:58] I believe that this woman here that
[24:00] Jesus was speaking to I believe her
[24:02] desire was to Worship in spirit and in
[24:05] truth but in the confusion of the of the
[24:08] church or whatever was going on in that
[24:10] day there had to be a personal visit of
[24:13] our Lord Jesus Christ to that individual
[24:15] that allowed her to take that position
[24:18] and worship in spirit and in truth amen
[24:22] now I believe if that was God what God
[24:25] wanted for her that's what God wants for
[24:27] you and that is our desire because our
[24:30] desires are only the result of God's
[24:32] desire for you
[24:34] amen my desire the desire that I have to
[24:37] worship Him in spirit and in truth is
[24:40] because it's his desire for me to
[24:43] worship Him in spirit and in truth amen
[24:46] he's not going to come to me because I
[24:49] have a desire but he's going to come to
[24:51] me because I he placed that desire in
[24:54] there amen as the predestinated seed of
[24:58] God as a predestinated seed of God he
[25:01] wants you he desires to for you to
[25:05] worship Him in spirit and in truth I
[25:07] love that because he seeketh such
[25:10] amen he seeketh such amen it's not you
[25:14] finding him he's seeking you amen he he
[25:18] wants you to worship Him amen the
[25:22] prophet of God said he said he loves to
[25:24] be worshiped amen but there's a there's
[25:27] a there's a special
[25:30] people don't like when we talk like this
[25:32] but it's the truth
[25:34] the the the the elect are a special
[25:37] group of people
[25:39] amen and the elect are the are a group
[25:43] of people who can worship him like no
[25:46] other
[25:47] like Noah there is no one on the face of
[25:51] this planet that that satisfies me more
[25:54] than my wife
[25:57] amen
[25:58] amen because she is my elect
[26:01] I elected her amen and he elected me
[26:05] amen and because of his election he
[26:08] desires My Worship
[26:11] amen he desires me to worship him he
[26:15] he's he seeketh you
[26:18] amen he seeketh you he seek he's seeking
[26:21] me amen not not Living Word Fellowship
[26:25] in Australia
[26:26] not BCF in in Ohio
[26:29] but as an individual
[26:32] amen he seeketh you amen all right Dan
[26:35] but I'm only 21. it don't matter how old
[26:38] you are it don't matter how young you
[26:40] are amen if God is seeking you you we it
[26:45] as a worshiper then he will find you
[26:50] amen because God doesn't look for
[26:52] anything and not find it
[26:55] amen because he he he's God Amen so
[27:01] those that he has chosen before the
[27:03] foundation of the world to to worship
[27:06] Him in spirit and in truth he's his he
[27:09] sets out to find them
[27:13] he sets out to to reveal himself to to
[27:18] them as individuals so that they can
[27:22] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[27:26] amen we want to be everything
[27:30] that God wants us to be
[27:34] amen but there's a catch to this
[27:37] and that is that you can't make yourself
[27:39] what he desires you to be
[27:43] you are totally dependent upon him to be
[27:48] who he has ordained you to be there's
[27:52] nothing that you can do to make yourself
[27:54] better
[27:55] there's nothing that you can do to to
[27:58] help God achieve his purpose oh we like
[28:01] that you've got a hand at times huh let
[28:03] me help you with that Lord yeah oh it
[28:06] doesn't work quite like that we find
[28:08] that out after if you've lived a few
[28:10] years you know you find that out that
[28:12] the the more you try to help God the
[28:14] more of a mess you make and all you're
[28:16] doing is making more work for him and
[28:18] he's just saying just let me do what I
[28:20] am ordained to do Amen Let me do what
[28:22] only I can do you just think you can do
[28:25] it but you can't do it just just leave
[28:27] it up to me amen but our desire is to be
[28:30] everything
[28:32] that God has ordained us to be but we
[28:35] are totally dependent upon him bringing
[28:39] us to that place of maturity where we
[28:43] can be what we are ordained to be
[28:45] because we can only be what we are
[28:48] ordained to be through maturity as we
[28:52] mature amen as we stay in the presence
[28:55] of the son
[28:56] amen so as a worshiper I I call it
[29:00] Progressive worship because as we mature
[29:04] it allows us to worship at a higher
[29:07] level
[29:08] now when I say worship don't get
[29:10] confused with singing or or or
[29:13] um playing an instrument because worship
[29:16] is not restricted to playing of
[29:18] instruments or singing a song because I
[29:21] can't play an instrument
[29:24] and I I can sing but I don't know if you
[29:27] call it singing
[29:28] all right so if it was restricted to
[29:31] that that rules me out
[29:33] either that I have to wait for God to
[29:35] give me a gift to be able to play a
[29:37] guitar I'd love to be able to play a
[29:38] guitar
[29:40] but that's not what that's not what
[29:42] worship is restricted to in fact our
[29:45] life is worship
[29:47] amen You by coming to church this
[29:50] morning this evening you're worshiping
[29:52] God you might say well brother Dan I'm
[29:54] not singing you don't need to sing
[29:56] you're worshiping God by coming to
[29:58] church amen so it's the the restoration
[30:02] of true worship this is something that
[30:05] God has allowed us to be or to do is to
[30:10] worship Him
[30:11] amen and it's a restoration God has
[30:14] restored worship
[30:17] because he's restored the word
[30:19] and worship and and the worship and the
[30:23] word are connected
[30:24] we'll see this in Genesis 22 because
[30:27] Abraham went to worship stay here while
[30:30] I and the son go to worship go and
[30:32] worship well I don't think they sung a
[30:33] song
[30:35] right
[30:37] but what they were doing was walking in
[30:39] the light of the word
[30:41] of the revealed wood
[30:43] amen let's not get too far ahead of
[30:45] ourselves all right
[30:47] all right the the the beautiful thing
[30:49] about this is that the Lord desires this
[30:53] for your life
[30:54] amen this is just so so wonderful that
[30:58] brother Brown says it's a it's a love
[31:00] story and this is exactly what it is God
[31:03] desires this for you it's his desire for
[31:06] you to worship Him
[31:09] in spirit and in truth amen
[31:14] amen little dry
[31:19] but there's plenty of water around here
[31:21] so
[31:24] amen
[31:27] amen
[31:30] so we want to thank the Lord for the
[31:31] opportunity that he's given us
[31:34] to be able to worship Him
[31:36] and I know this isn't the beginning of
[31:39] the special meetings but
[31:41] I just can't help it this is going to
[31:43] lead into the the next Services as well
[31:45] but
[31:47] um we we want to we want to worship
[31:50] the Lord we want to be who we are
[31:53] ordained to be
[31:55] in the offices that God has given us
[31:59] amen because we can't rely on anyone
[32:01] else's experience we can't rely or you
[32:05] know my wife is worshiping God therefore
[32:07] I'm worshiping God God I'm in a
[32:09] different office to my wife I'm a father
[32:11] I'm a husband she's a she's a wife and a
[32:14] mother it's a different office you know
[32:17] so God desires to be worshiped
[32:19] fully
[32:21] fully in the in the offices that we hold
[32:26] so I've got a few slides here and I'll
[32:29] just um we'll just begin this this story
[32:31] here in uh in Genesis 22.
[32:36] um I I and the lad will go and worship
[32:39] we've looked at that one there we'll
[32:41] just
[32:42] start here
[32:44] in Genesis chapter one and it came to
[32:48] pass after these things that God did
[32:51] tempt Abraham we know that means to try
[32:54] Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he
[32:58] said behold here I am so we want to
[33:01] notice here that God was not talking to
[33:03] Abram but God was talking to Abraham
[33:07] all right so we understand the process
[33:10] of this we understand that this is that
[33:12] God had given Abraham Abram a part of
[33:15] his own name and that that that
[33:17] signified the marriage when a man
[33:21] marries a a woman she takes on a part of
[33:25] his name all right so we understand that
[33:28] this was God speaking to a to a man who
[33:32] God had formed a relationship with that
[33:35] had already been in Union
[33:37] as if we can bring it into our time in
[33:40] which we are living in you know they
[33:42] were they were in Union Abraham had
[33:44] received the sign of circumcision he had
[33:47] taken on a part of God's name so he had
[33:50] we could say he'd received the baptism
[33:52] of the Holy Ghost
[33:53] upon his soul and God wanted to mature
[33:58] Abraham he wanted to take Abraham to a
[34:01] another level of worship so this was all
[34:04] about a relationship that God had
[34:07] established between himself and Abraham
[34:10] right God sought Abraham Abraham didn't
[34:15] seek God but God sought Abraham and
[34:19] found Abraham and Abraham said unto him
[34:23] behold here I am so we can see that this
[34:27] is all about a relationship that God had
[34:30] with an individual and this is the same
[34:33] thing that God wants with me this is the
[34:36] same thing that God wants with you I I
[34:39] haven't reached the Pinnacle of maturity
[34:41] as a husband I've been married for 28
[34:44] years but I'm still learning I'm still
[34:46] maturing in in that office all right so
[34:50] no matter how no matter where we are if
[34:54] God is still speaking to us the purpose
[34:56] of this relationship that you have with
[34:58] God is that he might bring you to full
[35:01] maturity amen but it's all about a
[35:05] relationship with the Lord and it's so
[35:08] important for us to to stay in tune with
[35:11] the voice of God Amen and to be able to
[35:13] hear that voice and not only hear the
[35:16] voice but respond to that voice when
[35:19] that that voice is speaking to us
[35:24] in Jeremiah 29 11 it says for I know the
[35:27] the thoughts that I think toward you
[35:30] saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not
[35:33] of evil to give you an expected end
[35:38] so we understand this and God God had
[35:40] thoughts towards Abraham
[35:43] God had thoughts towards Abraham when he
[35:46] was Abram
[35:48] all right but when after the union after
[35:51] that Union as bring it again into our
[35:54] time after that Union God still had
[35:57] thoughts towards Abraham that had not
[36:01] been revealed yet
[36:03] all right so just because we received
[36:05] the Holy Ghost just because we come
[36:07] become new creatures in Christ it it God
[36:11] still has thoughts concerning you
[36:14] amen and how we mature is by the
[36:18] unveiling or by the revealing of those
[36:21] thoughts
[36:22] amen and I I my desire is to know the
[36:27] thoughts of God concerning me
[36:29] amen I think this is such a beautiful
[36:32] thing because this is how a husband and
[36:34] wife work
[36:35] yeah if what a wife desires to know is
[36:39] the thoughts of her husband concerning
[36:41] her
[36:43] amen there's no the wife won't find
[36:45] satisfaction out of the out of the words
[36:49] of her husband
[36:51] she won't find it but that the husband
[36:54] can bring satisfaction she can he can
[36:57] bring peace to his wife by just
[37:01] expressing how he loves her how he
[37:04] appreciates her etc etc and God is doing
[37:08] the same thing here with with Abraham
[37:10] because God had thoughts concerning
[37:14] Abraham that Abraham did not know
[37:17] anything about
[37:19] he did not know anything about perhaps
[37:22] when Abraham
[37:24] um was finally a son to that that
[37:26] promise a father to the promised son
[37:29] perhaps he thought he'd reached his full
[37:32] potential
[37:34] but God had other thoughts
[37:37] amen God had other thoughts and we know
[37:40] that the scripture says I and the lad
[37:42] will return so this is quite some time
[37:44] after the after Isaac had been born but
[37:48] God has an appointed time also when
[37:52] those thoughts are to be revealed
[37:54] amen and this proves to us that we
[37:57] cannot reach maturity without the
[37:59] unveiling without the revealing of God's
[38:02] thoughts concerning us as an individual
[38:06] amen it's not a group it's not a church
[38:09] it's an individual affair amen and I I
[38:12] love this so much because it places me
[38:16] in a position where I I can't
[38:19] I can't be dependent upon anybody else
[38:22] I'm just purely relying upon God to
[38:26] allow me to be who I'm ordained to be
[38:30] how could John in the Book of Revelation
[38:32] come up higher if God didn't ask him to
[38:35] come up higher how could John come up
[38:38] higher if God didn't send a spirit down
[38:41] if to catch up John and bring him up
[38:43] higher amen John didn't try and build a
[38:46] ladder or build an escalator or elevator
[38:48] or something like that no sir God right
[38:51] John was Reliant upon the spirit of God
[38:54] catching him up and lifting him up into
[38:57] Heavenly places amen because now John
[39:00] had a new message now he had an Earthly
[39:03] message now he had a Heavenly message he
[39:06] was seeing Earthly things but then God
[39:08] took him up and now he was writing the
[39:10] Heavenly things what he saw in heaven
[39:13] amen so God has thoughts concerning you
[39:17] amen
[39:18] God has thoughts concerning you and
[39:20] those thoughts here are expressed in
[39:23] Psalm 40. many O Lord my God are they
[39:28] wonderful Works which thou has done and
[39:32] thy thoughts which are to us would they
[39:36] cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee
[39:40] for if if I would declare and speak of
[39:44] them they are more than can be numbered
[39:49] amen that's a lot of thoughts
[39:52] amen and and we are we are not we are
[39:57] not meant to try and presume what those
[39:59] thoughts are
[40:00] and God doesn't want you to presume what
[40:03] those thoughts are amen because when we
[40:06] presume anything we go forward without
[40:08] Authority we we just mess things up
[40:10] there's there's no confidence in it amen
[40:13] but if God has thoughts towards you he's
[40:16] not going to keep those thoughts to
[40:18] himself but he's going to reveal those
[40:20] thoughts it's his desire for you to know
[40:24] the thoughts amen it's his desire for
[40:27] you to know the thoughts that he has
[40:29] toward you amen amen I think that's just
[40:33] such a a beautiful
[40:34] uh it puts God in his place in our lives
[40:37] amen and that's what we want to do we
[40:40] want to take our position under under
[40:42] the headship of Christ
[40:45] amen as as his as his bride
[40:49] so God God has thoughts concerning you
[40:52] he wants you to know those thoughts God
[40:54] has thoughts uh to Abraham and now God
[40:59] was going to reveal those thoughts those
[41:03] thoughts that Abraham knew nothing about
[41:08] God says to Abraham he says take now thy
[41:11] son
[41:12] thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest
[41:16] and get thee into the land of Moriah and
[41:20] offer him there for a burnt offering
[41:23] upon one of the mountains which I will
[41:27] tell thee of
[41:29] there's a couple of things here we want
[41:31] to notice here the beginning there it
[41:34] says take now thy son thy only son
[41:39] I thought Isaac had two uh Abraham had
[41:42] two sons
[41:43] but God didn't recognize the first birth
[41:47] amen God only recognized the faith birth
[41:51] amen so this wasn't even on the cards
[41:55] here is this the only son amen so so
[41:58] Satan wants to point you to your first
[42:01] birth but God doesn't even recognize
[42:03] your first verse it's just pointing you
[42:05] to the second verse amen you must be
[42:08] born again
[42:09] amen and that's what enabled God to be
[42:12] able to come now because God couldn't
[42:14] say these things earlier on he had to
[42:17] wait for that Faith seed to come to life
[42:19] and now God could come and speak certain
[42:22] things to uh to Abraham concerning Isaac
[42:27] take now thy son their only son whom
[42:30] thou lovest you know God doesn't if you
[42:34] have many you don't mind parting with
[42:37] one
[42:38] but when you only have one
[42:41] it's deity
[42:44] right so God doesn't want something that
[42:47] is like second in your life
[42:50] he wants something that's first in your
[42:52] life he wants something that you only
[42:55] have one off
[42:57] and we only have one life
[42:59] on this Earth
[43:01] Amen in this in this body we only have
[43:03] one life and this is what God wants from
[43:06] us it meant he want he wants the thing
[43:09] that we have and that is the life that
[43:12] he has given us he wants us to give back
[43:15] to him what he has given to us
[43:18] amen and get thee into the land of Mara
[43:21] and offer him there
[43:24] for a burnt offering upon one of the
[43:27] mountains which I will tell thee of so
[43:31] we see here that there were more than
[43:33] one mountain there was more than one
[43:34] mount
[43:36] because it says
[43:39] it says offer upon one of the mountains
[43:43] so there was one mountain and there was
[43:46] mountains but God had a desire for
[43:48] Abraham to offer Isaac as a sacrifice on
[43:52] one mountain
[43:54] not just any mountain there was one
[43:57] provided place of worship
[43:59] amen because this is what Abraham was
[44:01] doing remember he said stay here while I
[44:04] and the sun go and worship there was a
[44:07] provided place of worship amen there
[44:10] were places but God had a place
[44:14] God had a place that Abraham he desired
[44:17] Abraham to worship Him in but Abraham
[44:21] didn't know that place God says here he
[44:24] says which I will tell thee off in other
[44:27] words I will reveal this place to you
[44:29] amen I I will I'm going to give you the
[44:32] opportunity to worship me in a place
[44:35] that I'm going to reveal to you
[44:38] amen God God is a is a he's a mighty God
[44:42] Amen this was God's desire for Abraham
[44:45] God's desire for Abraham was for Abraham
[44:49] to worship him in a particular place
[44:53] amen and it's God's desire for you to
[44:56] worship him in a particular place God
[44:59] wants you to come to full maturity in
[45:02] that place not a place of your liking
[45:05] not a place of your choosing not a place
[45:08] of the church's choosing or the pastor's
[45:10] choosing or mum's choosing or Dad's
[45:13] choosing about a place that he had
[45:15] chosen for you before the foundation of
[45:18] the world that's the place that he wants
[45:21] you to be and that's the place he wants
[45:23] you to worship and that's the place
[45:25] where your worship will come to full
[45:28] maturity in that place amen so that's
[45:32] God's desire for you
[45:35] amen it's my desire for you too
[45:38] but it's God's desire for you I can't
[45:40] get you there but he can
[45:42] amen he can so God it it God had
[45:47] promised to Abraham because we know when
[45:49] God speaks it's thus saith the Lord
[45:51] because the Lord is speaking we don't
[45:54] need to when the Lord speaks we don't
[45:56] need to judge whether it's thus saith
[45:57] the Lord or not it's just thus saith the
[46:00] Lord because it's the Lord speaking all
[46:02] right so when when God said to Abraham
[46:05] which I will tell thee of Abraham had
[46:08] thus saith the Lord amen Abraham had no
[46:11] reason to question is God going to keep
[46:13] his word or isn't he going to keep his
[46:15] word Abraham had already
[46:18] experienced that new purse Abraham had
[46:22] already experienced receiving the
[46:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost in his life
[46:26] Abraham knew that if God promised he
[46:30] will he will bring it to pass amen and
[46:32] if God has promised us maturity maturity
[46:36] will come if God has promised that
[46:38] before we leave here that all the
[46:41] greenness will be baked out of us then
[46:42] brothers and sisters oh the greenness
[46:45] will be baked out of us amen if God has
[46:47] promised us a body change you don't need
[46:50] to question oh I don't know if it's
[46:51] going to happen or not no if this does
[46:53] say of the Lord amen you can put your
[46:55] life on it it's gonna happen because God
[46:58] said it amen God said it amen so we see
[47:03] here that that what was happening now is
[47:06] that God was beginning to reveal his
[47:08] mind to Abraham God was starting to
[47:11] reveal his thoughts concerning Abraham
[47:15] to Abraham and this is why worship and
[47:18] the opening of the word are connected
[47:21] together as the opening of the word as
[47:24] the word opens you are then able to
[47:27] worship at a higher level amen as the
[47:31] the word progressively opens to us
[47:35] uh the word's still opening to me that
[47:38] the book is open but the book is still
[47:40] being opened to me the contents of the
[47:44] open book are still being revealed to me
[47:46] if if they're not what are you coming to
[47:49] church for
[47:51] if you're not you should be a pastor
[47:57] but we understand even the the to the
[47:59] Ministers of this gospel the word is
[48:01] opening and it opens progressively
[48:05] amen because God just doesn't whoosh
[48:07] open his open the word and we we he
[48:10] gives us character to handle the opening
[48:13] of the word
[48:14] amen because without the character we
[48:17] can't handle the power that comes with
[48:19] the opening of the word so when when
[48:21] when we come to a certain level of of
[48:24] character God opens the word to that
[48:27] level and then when he takes us through
[48:29] another trial and our character Rises
[48:31] and the word rise he opens the word
[48:33] another level you know when I was 10 but
[48:36] no way no way my dad would give me the
[48:39] car keys not to his car at least we had
[48:42] a farm car but not to his car amen but
[48:45] when I reached the level of maturity
[48:47] then then he he gave me the the keys to
[48:50] his car and allowed me to drive his car
[48:52] and God does the same thing he waits
[48:55] until we reach a level of maturity
[48:57] we get a level of character in our lives
[49:01] and then he opens the word a little bit
[49:03] more
[49:04] amen so we thank God for who he is in
[49:07] our lives this is God's desire for you
[49:11] this is God's desire for me God and God
[49:15] is revealing his mind to Abraham God is
[49:19] revealing his mind concerning you
[49:23] amen and with the opening of the word
[49:26] comes a higher level of worship
[49:30] amen as the word opens if the word is
[49:33] open to this level you can worship to
[49:35] that level
[49:36] God opens the word up higher it allows
[49:40] you to worship at a higher level God
[49:42] opens the word you rise up again God
[49:45] opens the word you rise up again that's
[49:48] why it's Progressive worship
[49:50] because it's a progressive revealing of
[49:53] God's word
[49:54] and my desire is to worship Him fully
[49:59] but what that's going to take is for the
[50:01] word to be fully open
[50:03] amen and that's where we're at now is
[50:06] the word is opening to us that's why
[50:09] there's there there's a people on Earth
[50:12] who can worship him like no others
[50:16] and I know that's an offense to some but
[50:18] that's just the truth because the word
[50:21] is open to some and it's not open to
[50:23] others
[50:25] I meant the word become open to Noah
[50:27] when God said Noah I need a boat build
[50:29] and I built what what got what God
[50:32] allowed Noah to do was to worship Him
[50:36] otherwise Noah would have continued
[50:38] planting his vegetables
[50:40] all right but God allowed Noah to enter
[50:43] into a worship through the opening of
[50:46] the word
[50:48] concerning Noah
[50:50] amen and there is an opening of the word
[50:53] concerning you as an individual there's
[50:57] a there's must be an opening of the word
[51:00] to you
[51:01] and that opening of the word allows you
[51:04] to worship him in the office
[51:09] that he has placed you in
[51:11] amen Noah was in office Moses was in
[51:14] office David was in an office when David
[51:17] put the Ark on a new cart where the
[51:20] Branham said God rejected the whole
[51:22] thing
[51:23] why because it wasn't according to the
[51:26] words
[51:27] so God rejected the worship because the
[51:30] worship wasn't according to the word so
[51:32] God had to bring David back to the word
[51:34] he had to restore David back to the word
[51:37] so then God could accept his worship
[51:40] because now he was doing according to
[51:43] the word
[51:44] amen so worship is worship is is an
[51:48] expression of the word
[51:51] and that worship is the word expressed
[51:54] when when when Noah built the ark it had
[51:57] one window
[51:59] if it had two
[52:02] it wasn't worship
[52:04] but God accepted the ark
[52:07] because it was built according to the
[52:10] word and God accepted Noah because it
[52:13] was he he worshiped God according to the
[52:16] word
[52:17] amen so our worship is not just
[52:19] something well I I I want to worship God
[52:22] we all want to worship God but God
[52:24] provides a way to worship and God
[52:28] provides a place of worship
[52:30] amen I like that so much God provides a
[52:34] way to worship
[52:35] and God provides a place of worship
[52:40] amen
[52:43] a Villain at home now
[52:46] amen praise the Lord
[52:50] so we see here that that God was going
[52:53] to reveal to Abraham where this place
[52:56] was he hadn't done it yet
[52:59] which I will tell thee of
[53:02] right he hadn't done it but Abraham had
[53:04] to walk by faith he told him a general
[53:07] direction
[53:09] the land of Moriah
[53:11] all right
[53:12] I was preaching this series at home and
[53:15] I never preached the same service twice
[53:17] uh in in the respect that because once
[53:20] you preach it once it opens up more so
[53:23] how can you go back to your previous
[53:24] note you've got to write it all again
[53:26] that I was preaching it over and over
[53:28] and over and and
[53:30] um my my son and daughter-in-law they
[53:34] um she was expecting and that chosen
[53:36] this name Mariah every time I'd preach
[53:39] it they come out say you said that name
[53:41] again
[53:42] I just couldn't put the two together you
[53:44] know they wouldn't tell me what it was
[53:46] and uh when she was born 12 weeks ago uh
[53:50] little little baby girl well that's her
[53:53] name Mariah you said it like 200 times
[53:55] in five weeks yeah
[53:59] foreign
[54:00] amen verse 3 and Abraham rose up early
[54:03] Abraham didn't hesitate
[54:06] amen he knew if God if God said
[54:10] something it's best just to rise up
[54:12] early and do it don't procrastinate
[54:14] about it just rise up early in the
[54:17] morning and did it and he saddled his
[54:18] ass and took two of his young men with
[54:20] him and and Isaac his son Enclave the
[54:24] wood for the burnt offering and rose up
[54:28] and went unto the place
[54:30] of which God had told him
[54:34] so we see here that that somewhere along
[54:37] the line here God had revealed to
[54:39] Abraham where this place was all right
[54:44] so we see in verse 2 abrah God was going
[54:47] to tell Abraham we see in verse 3 he
[54:50] went to the place of which God had told
[54:54] him
[54:56] amen
[55:05] so so Abraham was walking in a
[55:09] confidence that came from
[55:13] the thoughts of God revealed
[55:16] he wasn't walking in the confidence of
[55:18] himself
[55:19] he was walking in the conf he had the
[55:22] confidence of God
[55:24] wow
[55:27] the same confidence that God had God had
[55:29] when he said let there be
[55:32] [Music]
[55:33] it's the same confidence now that
[55:35] Abraham had in God's word you know God
[55:38] had faith in his own word
[55:40] amen and now Abraham was walking
[55:43] according to God's word he had the same
[55:46] confidence Abraham had the same
[55:48] confidence in God's word that God has in
[55:52] his own word
[55:54] wow that's that's pretty big
[55:58] that's but that's why God wants us to
[56:00] come to that's God's desire for you is
[56:04] to have complete Trust
[56:07] in his word amen complete trust you may
[56:10] not know all of it
[56:13] but what you do know walk in it
[56:16] amen place your confidence in what you
[56:19] know
[56:21] amen and as you walk with that
[56:24] confidence in what you know God will
[56:27] continually
[56:29] progressively unveil more and more of
[56:33] his plan for you
[56:35] amen Satan likes to tie us in knots
[56:38] sometimes and well you know you don't
[56:40] know very much it don't matter how much
[56:42] you know
[56:44] amen it's your desire to know everything
[56:47] amen but your your focus is what you
[56:51] know now
[56:52] amen and what you know now there's
[56:55] enough power in what you know now to
[56:58] defeat every demon that is trying to
[57:00] prevent you to walk in God's way right
[57:03] now
[57:04] amen that's why Abraham woke up early
[57:07] amen because he got an early start he
[57:10] knew that the devil would be there to
[57:12] tempt him we know that this was a
[57:14] three-day Journey we know that the the
[57:16] prophet of God said those three days is
[57:18] that three days of Temptation the devil
[57:21] come to him the devil come to him the
[57:22] devil come to him what are you doing
[57:24] what are you doing you know what why is
[57:26] why are you doing uh why are you
[57:28] sacrificing your son your only son all
[57:31] Abraham could say was because God told
[57:33] me to amen he didn't have a great
[57:37] explanation he didn't have a formula he
[57:40] didn't have a theological understanding
[57:43] he just said because God said so and if
[57:45] this is what God wants me to do then
[57:47] that's what I'm doing no matter what the
[57:50] circumstances I'm going to worship God
[57:53] amen sometimes we need this same
[57:55] attitude when we're coming to church a
[57:58] man who goes when we come to church we
[58:00] come to worship him and then by coming
[58:02] to church we are worshiping him but we
[58:05] often wonder why we have such a battle
[58:07] on Sunday morning
[58:09] yeah if you're gonna sleep in at any
[58:11] time it's Sunday morning right that's
[58:13] the morning that you feel the sleepiest
[58:17] it just is when I go to church I go to
[58:19] over a bridge water under the bridge
[58:21] ocean under the bridge you know the best
[58:23] day to fish
[58:27] Sunday morning
[58:29] Sunday afternoon the wind's up
[58:31] Sunday morning is the best day to fish
[58:35] why because Satan don't want you to make
[58:39] it there
[58:40] amen and Satan didn't want Abraham to
[58:43] make it there but when you have that
[58:45] confidence
[58:47] in God's word nothing can stop you
[58:49] nothing at all can stop you your God God
[58:52] requires more from us
[58:55] God requires us
[58:57] God requires a greater level I'll say
[59:01] that again God desires a greater level
[59:04] of worship
[59:06] than us sitting at home and streaming
[59:10] I'm not talking covert I'm talking those
[59:12] who choose to sit at home and Street
[59:14] stream God desires a greater level of
[59:18] worship from you than you sitting at
[59:20] home
[59:22] it's the truth
[59:24] it's because because of who you are God
[59:27] desires it
[59:29] God it's God's desire for you
[59:32] amen and and yeah I I know churches are
[59:35] a hard place
[59:37] there's all types of prickly people in
[59:39] church yeah most of them think I'm the
[59:41] prickliest the past is always the
[59:43] prickliest
[59:46] but you know that's God's order this is
[59:48] what God desires for us
[59:51] so Abraham was going to worship God had
[59:56] a provided place for him and God desired
[1:00:01] Abraham to be in that place
[1:00:05] amen God had provided the place of
[1:00:08] worship
[1:00:09] but it wasn't revealed
[1:00:13] the place was there
[1:00:16] but it wasn't revealed
[1:00:18] huh
[1:00:20] so what God was going to do was to
[1:00:23] reveal a place of worship that existed
[1:00:28] the revelation of it was not going to
[1:00:30] bring it into existence
[1:00:33] but it already existed
[1:00:36] amen and he what he was going to reveal
[1:00:39] who existed
[1:00:42] right he was going to reveal this
[1:00:45] mountain that existed
[1:00:47] there were mountains but there was a
[1:00:49] mountain
[1:00:50] that God wanted Abraham to come to and
[1:00:54] that mountain existed amen God has a
[1:00:58] provided place of worship amen that's a
[1:01:02] that's a beautiful message God has a
[1:01:05] provided place of worship it's here
[1:01:09] it exists amen but it's going to become
[1:01:12] a revelation to it's got to be something
[1:01:14] that God opens up to you
[1:01:17] amen oh yes but then I'll be over in
[1:01:20] Australia next week that's God's
[1:01:21] provided place of worship no it ain't
[1:01:25] don't bother
[1:01:27] stay here don't waste your money you'll
[1:01:29] lose your luggage and everything just
[1:01:30] just stay here until you receive a
[1:01:33] revelation of that place because you're
[1:01:35] going to find that place is closer
[1:01:38] then you think it is and it's not a
[1:01:41] geographical location
[1:01:44] amen amen God's provided place
[1:01:48] Ephesians
[1:01:49] oh sorry I didn't have this one on slide
[1:01:51] Ephesians 3 9 says to make all men see
[1:01:55] what is the Fellowship of the mystery
[1:01:57] which from the beginning of the world
[1:02:00] hath been hid in God who created All
[1:02:04] Things by Jesus Christ
[1:02:07] amen God has a provided place of worship
[1:02:12] amen
[1:02:14] amen
[1:02:20] all of these events all of these things
[1:02:23] all this journey that Abraham was on
[1:02:27] was going to happen by the opening of
[1:02:30] the word for Abraham's day
[1:02:36] it wouldn't happen if if Abraham
[1:02:39] took Noah's message or Moses message
[1:02:43] this was
[1:02:45] God revealing the word for his day
[1:02:51] this was God making things possible in
[1:02:54] Abraham's Life by the revealing of the
[1:02:58] word for his day
[1:03:01] it was God that was going to reveal this
[1:03:05] place
[1:03:07] it was the word of God that revealed the
[1:03:11] place it was the word of God that
[1:03:14] allowed Abraham to see the place it was
[1:03:18] the word of God that allowed Abraham to
[1:03:21] Worship in that place
[1:03:23] amen so we can't hold any credit to
[1:03:26] ourself
[1:03:27] amen it's all God
[1:03:30] amen we we're fellowshiping this morning
[1:03:33] and we we we're all going to have the
[1:03:36] same conclude the same testimony
[1:03:39] of how we got to that wedding supper and
[1:03:43] we'll all point to the same individual
[1:03:46] and as we'll say it's because he made it
[1:03:49] possible it's it's nothing that I did
[1:03:52] it's nothing that anyone did it's
[1:03:55] something that he did he made it
[1:03:58] possible
[1:03:59] amen and he's still making it possible
[1:04:04] amen we see here then on the third day
[1:04:07] Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the
[1:04:11] place are far off
[1:04:13] and Abraham said unto his young men
[1:04:15] abide ye here with the ass and I and the
[1:04:18] lad will go Yonder and worship and come
[1:04:21] again to you so we see here that
[1:04:24] progressively as Abraham walked by faith
[1:04:28] God's thoughts concerning him will
[1:04:32] become revealed
[1:04:34] all right so now Abraham he went from
[1:04:37] being told there was a place
[1:04:39] to being told where that place was to
[1:04:42] now in verse 4 he was able to see that
[1:04:45] place
[1:04:46] so it was obvious here that the only way
[1:04:49] that he could see God's provided place
[1:04:52] of worship was if God had revealed the
[1:04:56] particular place the mountain amongst
[1:04:59] the mountains where God desired for
[1:05:02] Abraham to worship Him amen so what who
[1:05:06] who made this possible God made this
[1:05:09] possible amen God made it possible
[1:05:12] for Abraham now to see it so what we
[1:05:16] understand now is that once upon a time
[1:05:19] the thoughts of God were revealed to
[1:05:21] Abraham and now those thoughts of God
[1:05:25] were the thoughts of Abraham
[1:05:28] right so Abraham had taken on the mind
[1:05:31] of God
[1:05:32] all right so the thoughts of God were
[1:05:35] now the thoughts of Abraham but now God
[1:05:38] was looking at that place
[1:05:41] but so God could see that place
[1:05:44] but Abraham couldn't see it but now here
[1:05:47] in verse 4 now Abraham could see what
[1:05:51] God saw
[1:05:53] amen so it went from being having a mind
[1:05:56] of God to to now seeing what God saw
[1:06:00] amen Abraham could see Abraham had the
[1:06:03] vision of God concerning him he still
[1:06:07] wasn't in that place but he could see
[1:06:10] that place amen he could see the place
[1:06:13] in material form
[1:06:17] amen remembering that these this world
[1:06:21] was created it was once a thought
[1:06:25] that became word that became manifested
[1:06:29] amen so now what Abraham was looking at
[1:06:32] was the manifested thoughts of God
[1:06:35] amen he was looking at the spoken word
[1:06:38] of God he was looking at a mountain
[1:06:40] amongst the mountains and looking at it
[1:06:43] as the manifested word of God saying
[1:06:45] that is God's provided place of worship
[1:06:48] that is the place that God has revealed
[1:06:51] that he wants me to worship him in
[1:06:54] amen and and that's it's such a
[1:06:57] beautiful thing the the mystery had been
[1:07:00] revealed
[1:07:03] Abraham was now fellowshipping with the
[1:07:07] mystery
[1:07:09] amen he was looking at the mystery and
[1:07:12] he was fellowshipping with the mystery
[1:07:15] amen Abraham didn't look at God didn't
[1:07:18] point it I don't know how God revealed
[1:07:19] it but let's just say God didn't point
[1:07:22] it out to Abraham and then Abraham
[1:07:24] turned away and then Abraham turned back
[1:07:26] and say now which one was it hey Isaac
[1:07:29] can you remember if it's a rebel it's it
[1:07:32] was a revelation to him amen it was a
[1:07:35] revelation to him he testifies of it
[1:07:37] here in verse five you stay here while I
[1:07:40] in the lad go Yonder in worship and we
[1:07:42] will return unto you he knew where he
[1:07:43] was going
[1:07:45] he knew he knew God's provided place of
[1:07:47] worship it had been revealed to him
[1:07:52] amen the mysteries of God had been
[1:07:55] revealed
[1:07:58] all right he was now fellowshipping with
[1:08:01] the mystery
[1:08:03] beautiful
[1:08:05] God's desire for you
[1:08:07] God's desire for Abraham God's desire
[1:08:11] for you as an individual is the
[1:08:13] fellowship with the mystery amen it's a
[1:08:17] it's a revealed place
[1:08:20] it's a place that God reveals to you
[1:08:23] it's a secret place
[1:08:30] it don't matter
[1:08:32] if we're getting confidence by numbers
[1:08:36] there's something wrong with that
[1:08:37] experience
[1:08:39] because Abraham was alone
[1:08:42] amen Abraham was alone
[1:08:45] if if the bigger the church the more
[1:08:48] confident we become
[1:08:51] I question your experience
[1:08:54] because you should be able to stand
[1:08:56] alone
[1:08:57] if you're the only one if you're the
[1:09:00] only David
[1:09:02] I mean you should be able to stand alone
[1:09:05] if it's revealed to you if it's a
[1:09:07] revelation to you don't you don't need a
[1:09:10] group mentality
[1:09:12] amen you don't you don't you don't get
[1:09:14] confidence because there's one brother
[1:09:16] standing beside you
[1:09:18] amen because that's all you need to be a
[1:09:21] denomination is two people
[1:09:24] you don't need a group you just need two
[1:09:26] people
[1:09:27] all right so you've you've got to be
[1:09:29] able to stand alone
[1:09:31] and Abraham's stood alone and he looked
[1:09:33] at that mountain he said that's God's
[1:09:36] provided place for me
[1:09:37] that's where God is directing me to
[1:09:40] that's where he wants me to go
[1:09:42] for you man
[1:09:44] that's the place
[1:09:46] where all things are possible
[1:09:49] that's the place where the impossible is
[1:09:52] impossible
[1:09:55] God's elect
[1:09:58] this is his desire for you
[1:10:01] this is his desire for me
[1:10:04] he he desires you to come to full
[1:10:07] maturity
[1:10:09] he desires me to come to full maturity
[1:10:15] amen and I thank him for it because
[1:10:18] without him having that desire I can't
[1:10:21] reach it
[1:10:23] and part of the part of coming to
[1:10:26] maturity is receiving the revelation of
[1:10:31] the mystery
[1:10:33] Christ is the mystery of God revealed a
[1:10:38] part of the Fulfillment of of God's
[1:10:41] desire for your life is the revealing of
[1:10:45] the mystery
[1:10:46] amen it's so so beautiful it's so
[1:10:50] personal
[1:10:51] it's such a personal love story you you
[1:10:55] you you speak to people we've heard a
[1:10:58] couple of testimonies since we've been
[1:10:59] here and our our walks are personal
[1:11:03] and it's meant to be that's how God
[1:11:06] wants it that's how he desires it amen
[1:11:10] amen
[1:11:13] in that place
[1:11:15] all things are possible
[1:11:18] Abraham knew this based upon verse 5
[1:11:23] because he said I and the lad will
[1:11:25] return
[1:11:26] the very lad that God said I want you to
[1:11:29] offer him as a sacrifice
[1:11:31] Abraham said we will return
[1:11:34] and you don't think the devil was on his
[1:11:37] shoulder saying but God said you're
[1:11:39] going to have to sacrifice him
[1:11:42] right Satan will try and run you down
[1:11:46] right up into the end the prophet of God
[1:11:48] said he says Satan hates Revelation but
[1:11:52] we love it amen but whenever Revelation
[1:11:55] comes you can expect there to be a
[1:11:58] challenge and he'll fight that right to
[1:12:01] the end right to the end and this is why
[1:12:04] also the opening of the word
[1:12:07] overcoming and worship are connected
[1:12:13] because we worship by overcoming and we
[1:12:16] overcome by the opening of the word
[1:12:19] amen so you'd think Abraham had some
[1:12:21] things to overcome oh sure he did the
[1:12:24] biggest thing he had to overcome was
[1:12:25] himself
[1:12:27] amen this is the biggest thing he had to
[1:12:29] come let me ask you a question what was
[1:12:31] the greater Abraham receiving the
[1:12:34] promised son or now Abraham's obedience
[1:12:37] to God to go and offer that promised son
[1:12:39] at us as a sacrifice
[1:12:43] that's a tough place to be
[1:12:47] that's a tough place to be but it
[1:12:49] expresses
[1:12:51] the the relationship
[1:12:55] that God had with Abraham
[1:12:58] because we're all going to come to this
[1:13:00] place
[1:13:01] we're all going to come to a place where
[1:13:03] God asks us to do things that are hard
[1:13:06] to understand why he's asking us to do
[1:13:09] it but he he only does that when we
[1:13:13] reach a level of maturity where we can
[1:13:16] handle the challenge
[1:13:18] amen so God is God is not out of order
[1:13:21] God knows what he's doing amen and I
[1:13:25] thank him for that because sometimes I
[1:13:27] think I do but I find out that I don't
[1:13:29] but God never has that problem he
[1:13:32] doesn't think he had things in order and
[1:13:34] find out that he doesn't he he has
[1:13:37] everything in order so God brings us to
[1:13:40] a place where we can handle the trials
[1:13:43] that he allows to come in our life
[1:13:47] no matter where you are now if you are
[1:13:49] facing a trial the only reason that you
[1:13:52] are facing that trial is that because
[1:13:54] God believes in you
[1:13:57] you think God believed in Abraham of
[1:13:59] course he believed in Abraham God
[1:14:01] believes in you
[1:14:03] amen God a king hazarus Esther's King
[1:14:08] Esther's husband believed in her
[1:14:11] he believed in her he believed that she
[1:14:14] would do what was necessary to meet the
[1:14:17] challenge of her day and I want to tell
[1:14:19] you something God believes in you
[1:14:22] amen Satan wants you not to believe in
[1:14:24] yourself but guess what you're not meant
[1:14:26] to believe in yourself you're meant to
[1:14:28] believe in God's word
[1:14:30] so take his advice and don't believe in
[1:14:33] him but believe in God's word see he
[1:14:36] believes in me and that's who I believe
[1:14:38] I believe in him
[1:14:41] amen let's not trip ourselves up look by
[1:14:43] looking at our own flesh because our own
[1:14:46] flesh is the very thing that we must
[1:14:48] overcome we don't have confidence in
[1:14:50] self
[1:14:52] no sir we don't have confidence in this
[1:14:55] body
[1:14:56] no no we have confidence in the one who
[1:14:59] gave us this body but we don't have
[1:15:01] confidence in this body whatsoever amen
[1:15:04] this body cannot change itself
[1:15:06] it's got to be changed
[1:15:09] amen are you ready for the Rapture yeah
[1:15:12] have you started changing your body
[1:15:14] how could Abraham be turned back to a
[1:15:17] young man again how could Sarah be
[1:15:19] turned back to a young woman Again by
[1:15:21] yourself by themselves it's impossible
[1:15:24] it's absolutely impossible it's it takes
[1:15:27] the the hand of the Lord in our lives
[1:15:30] Amen to make the changes in our life
[1:15:33] that need to be need to be changed for
[1:15:36] us to reach our destination this is why
[1:15:38] it's a message of Grace and people want
[1:15:40] to make it a law I'm sorry you don't
[1:15:42] have the same revelation of the same
[1:15:44] thing that I have you've got a different
[1:15:46] revelation of what of what I that than
[1:15:49] what God has given me amen but we can't
[1:15:51] even have the revelation of what we have
[1:15:53] unless he gave it to us amen says oh God
[1:15:57] your education don't help your your
[1:16:00] ability to to speak in excellence
[1:16:02] doesn't help thank God for that but it's
[1:16:05] him who helps and that my Help Cometh
[1:16:08] From The Lord
[1:16:09] amen amen and we thank him for his
[1:16:12] faithfulness to us amen I thank him for
[1:16:15] his faithfulness so Abraham knew this
[1:16:18] was the place that God has put his name
[1:16:21] Abraham knew that this was the place
[1:16:24] that God had chosen for him to worship
[1:16:27] Abraham knew that this was the place
[1:16:30] that that he was going to do the
[1:16:33] impossible Abraham knew that that if if
[1:16:38] Abraham knew that God had the ability to
[1:16:41] provide himself a sacrifice
[1:16:44] but all along Abraham went all the way
[1:16:48] with the Lord
[1:16:50] so we see here that Abraham saw that
[1:16:53] place
[1:16:55] this is interesting because this is not
[1:16:57] where it stopped
[1:16:59] because when he saw it he wasn't there
[1:17:02] he was at the foot of it
[1:17:05] but he hadn't entered into it
[1:17:08] all right
[1:17:09] so we can't stop just because it's we
[1:17:12] see it we've got to go all the way
[1:17:15] all right because Abraham was
[1:17:18] fellowshipping with that mystery but
[1:17:20] what God wanted for Abraham was to have
[1:17:23] a higher level of Fellowship
[1:17:27] God didn't want Abraham to fellowship
[1:17:29] with the mystery from a distance
[1:17:34] God's desire for Abraham like his desire
[1:17:37] for you is for you to become one with
[1:17:41] the mystery
[1:17:42] amen and this is why Abraham says
[1:17:47] here in
[1:17:49] um
[1:17:50] uh sorry I've jumped ahead of myself
[1:17:54] no I haven't and they came to the place
[1:17:56] which God had told him of
[1:18:00] so now he came to that place
[1:18:02] he entered into that place
[1:18:05] now his his even though he was
[1:18:07] fellowshipping with the mystery now he
[1:18:10] was fellowshipping at a higher level
[1:18:12] all right before you married your wife
[1:18:15] you would fellowship with her
[1:18:18] but when you married your wife you you
[1:18:20] entered into a higher level of
[1:18:22] Fellowship
[1:18:23] right but but even through marriage your
[1:18:27] fellowship is growing
[1:18:29] so some people think that that um when
[1:18:32] you get married you don't have trials
[1:18:33] people who think that aren't married
[1:18:37] never read a book about marriage that uh
[1:18:40] from a person who hasn't been married
[1:18:42] never read a book from about raising
[1:18:45] children if they haven't raised children
[1:18:47] but in Fellowship through trials our
[1:18:51] fellowship increases
[1:18:54] amen through trials our fellowship
[1:18:57] increases we grow together go go closer
[1:19:00] together God's desire here was was now
[1:19:05] for Abraham to enter into that place and
[1:19:08] Abraham came to that place that God had
[1:19:12] told him of so now Abraham and the and
[1:19:17] the Mystery become one
[1:19:21] now Abraham could flip off his sandals
[1:19:24] and dig his feet into the mystery
[1:19:27] and say this is God's provided place for
[1:19:31] me
[1:19:31] this is God's provided place of
[1:19:35] Fellowship for me this is where God is
[1:19:38] going to this is the place that God's
[1:19:41] going to work through me Abraham could
[1:19:44] get bend over and pick up the soil from
[1:19:46] the from the ground and run it through
[1:19:48] his hands and say this is the mystery
[1:19:51] this is I'm fellowshipping with the
[1:19:54] mystery at a great level amen so God
[1:19:58] desires you to be one with the mystery
[1:20:01] but God desires you to be totally one
[1:20:05] with the mystery amen God desires a
[1:20:08] complete Oneness between you and the
[1:20:12] Mystery amen so to to today
[1:20:18] so I must have skipped the slide here
[1:20:20] let me just see what this next one is
[1:20:27] and Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father
[1:20:29] and said my father he said here I am my
[1:20:32] son and he said behold the fire and the
[1:20:35] wood but where is the Lamb for a burnt
[1:20:38] offering
[1:20:39] and Abraham sounded
[1:20:42] and Abraham said my son God will provide
[1:20:44] for him himself a lamb for a burnt
[1:20:48] offering so they went both
[1:20:51] of them together
[1:20:54] amen so it's interesting today where are
[1:20:57] we standing
[1:20:58] as as the Bride of Jesus Jesus Christ
[1:21:00] where are we
[1:21:03] particular time because it's important
[1:21:06] for us to understand as it was for
[1:21:09] Abraham to understand where he was
[1:21:11] standing because in that place all
[1:21:14] things are possible
[1:21:16] in that place all things are possible
[1:21:18] because in that place you are no longer
[1:21:21] the preeminent one but God is the
[1:21:24] preeminent one and to him there's
[1:21:26] nothing that is not impossible all
[1:21:28] things are possible to him amen so where
[1:21:32] are we as the Bride of Jesus Christ been
[1:21:34] baptized into him by that one Spirit
[1:21:37] into the body of Christ this is where he
[1:21:40] has placed his name
[1:21:45] in his body he has placed his name in
[1:21:49] his body
[1:21:50] who is his bride
[1:21:53] in in there all things are possible
[1:21:57] amen where are we standing where where
[1:22:00] are we at where where the the things
[1:22:04] that weren't possible Once Upon A Time
[1:22:06] are now possible
[1:22:08] amen the things that that weren't
[1:22:11] possible for me as a husband are now
[1:22:13] possible
[1:22:14] the things that weren't possible for me
[1:22:16] as a father are now possible
[1:22:19] amen because God Has Lifted me to a
[1:22:22] higher level of fellowship with himself
[1:22:25] enabling me to be who I am ordained to
[1:22:28] be as a husband as a pastor as a father
[1:22:32] etc etc I cannot be who I am ordained to
[1:22:37] be as a husband without the opening of
[1:22:39] the word
[1:22:41] I cannot it's impossible it's impossible
[1:22:44] for me to be who I am ordained to be as
[1:22:47] a pastor without the opening of the word
[1:22:53] and it's impossible just like the same
[1:22:56] here it was impossible for Abraham to
[1:22:59] come to full maturity without the
[1:23:01] opening of the word
[1:23:03] First Kings 17 the woman who was who was
[1:23:06] who was dying because of the the drought
[1:23:08] that was upon the Earth and God sent
[1:23:10] Elijah to that woman a woman who had he
[1:23:13] had commanded to sustain him
[1:23:16] that that woman was dying the same curse
[1:23:19] that the rest of the world was
[1:23:22] all right if God had not have intervened
[1:23:25] she would have died the same way that
[1:23:27] her neighbor died
[1:23:29] and meant the curse that was upon you
[1:23:31] even though she was elect even though
[1:23:33] she was chosen without the opening of
[1:23:36] the word she was going to die the same
[1:23:38] curse
[1:23:39] amen she could not be the mother she was
[1:23:42] ordained to be to her son
[1:23:45] without the opening of the word but the
[1:23:48] opening of the word allowed her to be
[1:23:50] the mother that she was ordained to be
[1:23:53] now that woman that she didn't like
[1:23:55] woman she represents the body of Christ
[1:23:57] she represents fathers mothers wives
[1:24:01] husbands pastors grandparents Etc Sons
[1:24:04] daughters whatever office you hold that
[1:24:08] is who she represents as the body of
[1:24:11] Christ
[1:24:12] but the body of Christ cannot be who she
[1:24:15] is ordained to be without the opening of
[1:24:17] the word so the opening of the word
[1:24:19] enables me it makes it possible for me
[1:24:22] to be the husband that I'm ordained to
[1:24:24] be to my wife
[1:24:26] in it enables me to be the father that
[1:24:30] I'm I'm ordained to be to my children it
[1:24:33] enables me to be the husband the pastor
[1:24:36] that I'm ordained to be to my to my
[1:24:38] church
[1:24:39] [Music]
[1:24:40] without it
[1:24:42] my family dies
[1:24:44] the same curse
[1:24:47] that the world dies
[1:24:50] wow
[1:24:52] wow she she was preparing herself for
[1:24:55] death
[1:24:56] she knew this
[1:24:58] amen well you know we should know it too
[1:25:02] because it makes it makes us very
[1:25:04] grateful
[1:25:05] for what God has given us
[1:25:08] amen God has given us life
[1:25:12] God has given us the the ability by the
[1:25:16] opening of the word to be who we are
[1:25:19] ordained to be for this day in which we
[1:25:23] live in amen she she fellowshipped with
[1:25:28] the mystery
[1:25:30] she she was not feeding on the word of
[1:25:32] Elijah
[1:25:33] she was feeding on the body word son of
[1:25:35] man
[1:25:36] as long as she was feeding from that
[1:25:39] word
[1:25:40] life was being restored
[1:25:44] I met she was getting ready for death
[1:25:46] she said we're gonna have this little
[1:25:48] morsel of bread and we're gonna die
[1:25:51] so by then her countenance had had
[1:25:54] become like a a starving woman a cheeks
[1:25:58] had begin to sunk in and sink in perhaps
[1:26:01] her son was in a better State than what
[1:26:03] she was because you know a mother's love
[1:26:05] is a sacrificial love you know they'll
[1:26:08] give to the children if there's not
[1:26:09] enough for everyone just to make that
[1:26:11] allow their children to get through and
[1:26:13] perhaps a child was in a better
[1:26:15] condition than what she was but she
[1:26:18] understood that that without the words
[1:26:21] she cannot be who she's ordained to be
[1:26:23] but that that word in which she received
[1:26:26] and she began to feed on it slowly
[1:26:30] progressively restored her strength so
[1:26:34] that through that restoration she could
[1:26:36] then be who she was ordained to be to
[1:26:40] her family
[1:26:42] amen and that's what God's word does for
[1:26:44] you as parents is it restores your
[1:26:48] ability to be able to be the parents
[1:26:51] that you are ordained to be to your
[1:26:53] children
[1:26:54] amen we we don't we don't need Google to
[1:26:58] tell us how to be parents
[1:27:01] amen sorry Google we don't we don't need
[1:27:03] YouTube for tutoring lessons of how to
[1:27:06] be a husband if we feed on the body word
[1:27:10] you find yourself becoming you'll find
[1:27:14] yourself progressively becoming the wife
[1:27:16] that you are ordained to be to your
[1:27:19] husband the the very wife that God
[1:27:22] desires you to be
[1:27:24] amen it's God's desire for you
[1:27:27] and meant to be who you are ordained to
[1:27:30] be in 2022.
[1:27:34] in the office that you hold
[1:27:37] officers
[1:27:38] that we hold
[1:27:41] God desires you in that office
[1:27:45] to come to full maturity in that office
[1:27:49] amen me as a husband God desires for me
[1:27:53] to be the the the the most godliest
[1:27:57] husband that was ever on earth
[1:28:00] that's his desire for me
[1:28:02] and that's his desire for you and it's
[1:28:05] same with my wife God's desire for my
[1:28:07] wife is for her to be the most Godly
[1:28:10] wife there is on Earth
[1:28:12] [Music]
[1:28:13] amen and it's my desire for me to be
[1:28:17] what he wants me to be
[1:28:19] [Music]
[1:28:20] God's provided a place of worship the
[1:28:22] prophet of God Says by one Spirit we're
[1:28:25] all baptized into one body
[1:28:27] and that body is a family
[1:28:31] the family of God
[1:28:33] and that's the house of God and the
[1:28:37] house of God is the name of Jesus Christ
[1:28:41] the name of the Lord is a mighty tower
[1:28:44] the righteous run into it and are safe
[1:28:50] there are many fine women in this
[1:28:52] building tonight find
[1:28:56] women in this building tonight find
[1:28:58] loyal women but there's only one Mrs
[1:29:01] Branham William Branham she's the one
[1:29:04] goes home with me she's the one that's
[1:29:08] my wife
[1:29:11] there is a fine people in the world fine
[1:29:14] churches but there's only one Mrs Jesus
[1:29:17] Christ and that's who he's coming for
[1:29:21] that's where his name lies there is
[1:29:26] where his worship is in her and her
[1:29:31] alone
[1:29:32] amen that is true oh yes sir
[1:29:36] amen we understand that when after
[1:29:39] Abraham
[1:29:41] um
[1:29:42] Abraham went through the process of
[1:29:45] building the Altar and placing the the
[1:29:47] wood in a particular order and putting
[1:29:49] the fire under the warden Isaac was upon
[1:29:53] the the the the Altar and Abraham had
[1:29:56] had raised his hand to to go through
[1:29:59] with God's plan
[1:30:02] God knows when we're bluffing
[1:30:07] he knows when we're not serious
[1:30:10] all right because the angel of the Lord
[1:30:12] was standing right behind Abraham
[1:30:16] because God knew Abraham
[1:30:20] amen God knew Abraham
[1:30:23] so God knew that what Abraham got what
[1:30:27] God had asked Abraham to do he was going
[1:30:30] to go through it
[1:30:31] meant so so God had the angel of the
[1:30:34] Lord he was the angel of the Lord was
[1:30:36] standing right beside him
[1:30:37] amen because he knew that Abraham was
[1:30:41] going to go through it you know God God
[1:30:42] knows when we're bluffing he knows when
[1:30:45] we're not bluffing we don't know when
[1:30:47] we're bluffing but but we find out when
[1:30:49] we are bluffing but but God knows when
[1:30:51] we're serious about him
[1:30:53] amen and that's that's what we want to
[1:30:55] be but we understand that that God
[1:30:58] provided a lamb and and that's why
[1:31:01] Abraham called that place
[1:31:05] Jehovah Jireh
[1:31:07] God provided for himself a sacrifice so
[1:31:11] that was the place that God had put his
[1:31:13] name and this is the place that God had
[1:31:17] put his name in this place all things
[1:31:21] are possible
[1:31:22] in this place nothing is impossible be
[1:31:26] it unto you according to your faith Amen
[1:31:29] in this place nothing is impossible it
[1:31:32] may seem impossible but it's not
[1:31:34] impossible why because it's God's
[1:31:37] provided place and God's provided place
[1:31:40] of worship is in her and her alone there
[1:31:45] is no other place he has not placed his
[1:31:47] name in any other woman he has placed
[1:31:50] his name in his bride in his body and in
[1:31:54] that place
[1:31:56] all things are possible
[1:32:01] I've noticed here I've I've almost quit
[1:32:04] having discernment anymore just lay my
[1:32:07] hands on the sick
[1:32:09] I've been noticing when my things I've
[1:32:13] I never I didn't get to one third of the
[1:32:16] people otherwise this way I get to more
[1:32:20] than I ever did get to and I find out a
[1:32:24] better results
[1:32:26] by just getting myself into God's arms
[1:32:31] and saying Lord God
[1:32:34] you promised it
[1:32:36] it's your promise
[1:32:38] it's not mine
[1:32:40] it's yours
[1:32:41] and you promised you would do it and
[1:32:45] I've seen you do it
[1:32:49] and I'm going to believe you're going to
[1:32:52] do it
[1:32:53] because you've been baptized
[1:32:57] I've been baptized into your body
[1:33:01] and your spirit here to identify that
[1:33:05] that's the truth
[1:33:07] amen that's the place of worship then
[1:33:11] you get into a place all things are
[1:33:15] possible
[1:33:17] then you get into a place that your
[1:33:20] motives and your objectives for your
[1:33:22] achievements is just exactly in the will
[1:33:25] of God
[1:33:26] and when you lay your hands there and
[1:33:29] believe it it's going to happen
[1:33:31] do you believe that
[1:33:33] amen so he's he's drawing confidence
[1:33:36] here from the place that he is standing
[1:33:40] amen you'll notice right at the
[1:33:42] beginning there he says I'm I'm going to
[1:33:44] believe
[1:33:46] I'm going to believe you're going to do
[1:33:48] it because I've been baptized into your
[1:33:52] body
[1:33:53] so the place that he was
[1:33:56] gave him conf the confidence that he
[1:33:59] need needed to meet the challenge of his
[1:34:02] hour
[1:34:04] the place
[1:34:06] on the second day Abraham didn't have
[1:34:10] that confidence
[1:34:12] because he wasn't in that place
[1:34:14] but when he entered into that place
[1:34:16] there was a confidence that came as a
[1:34:20] result of entering into that place
[1:34:23] that now all things are possible
[1:34:27] huh it's like entering into it if you
[1:34:30] walk into the airplane but you're not on
[1:34:31] the airplane well you're not going to
[1:34:33] get to your destination until you're in
[1:34:35] the airplane but when you're in the
[1:34:37] airplane there's a there's a confidence
[1:34:39] that comes that now I'm in the place
[1:34:42] I'm in the place that I need to be in in
[1:34:44] order to get to my destination and and
[1:34:47] that's what being in the body of Christ
[1:34:49] is it's a place that God has provided
[1:34:53] for you to be in and you must have
[1:34:56] confidence in the place that he has
[1:34:59] placed you in and that is in the body of
[1:35:02] Christ
[1:35:03] in that place all things are possible in
[1:35:06] that place nothing is impossible all
[1:35:10] things are possible in that place
[1:35:14] amen and there there is a bride who is
[1:35:17] in that place
[1:35:19] now the the way that I am speaking is
[1:35:22] the way that I'm going to project this
[1:35:24] over the next couple of services is in
[1:35:26] our offices that God has placed Us in
[1:35:29] all things are possible
[1:35:31] amen as a father all things are possible
[1:35:34] nothing is impossible for me in that
[1:35:37] place I can be who I'm ordained to be in
[1:35:40] that place as a pastor as long as I'm in
[1:35:43] that place all things are possible in
[1:35:46] that place as a wife all things are
[1:35:49] possible in that place you have nothing
[1:35:51] to fear in that place it doesn't matter
[1:35:54] how Wicked This World gets you have
[1:35:56] nothing to fear in that place because in
[1:36:00] that place God will provide for himself
[1:36:03] sorry
[1:36:04] Hallelujah your children are not your
[1:36:07] children they're God's children that he
[1:36:08] gave to you in that place God will
[1:36:11] provide for himself
[1:36:12] God will provide for his own children
[1:36:15] the love and care that your children
[1:36:17] need the love and care that your wife
[1:36:19] needs the love and care that your
[1:36:21] husband needs
[1:36:22] all things are possible
[1:36:25] in that place
[1:36:27] amen we've got to recognize Where We Are
[1:36:31] amen we've got to take confidence
[1:36:35] from the place where we are
[1:36:39] amen we might be living in Satan's Eden
[1:36:42] but that's not my place of worship
[1:36:45] my place of worship is in that body of
[1:36:48] Christ
[1:36:49] and in Satan's Eden I will worship Him
[1:36:52] in Satan's Eden he will be worshiped
[1:36:55] through my office as husband
[1:36:58] amen but he cannot be worshiped
[1:37:01] as through me through my office as
[1:37:04] husband if I am being a husband my own
[1:37:07] way
[1:37:09] no it's not possible
[1:37:11] it's the same as it's not possible it's
[1:37:13] impossible for God to accept the ark
[1:37:16] um that Noah built if Noah had put
[1:37:19] another door or another window or made
[1:37:21] it a different measurement or just one
[1:37:23] plank higher than what it was meant to
[1:37:25] be God could not have accepted it amen
[1:37:28] and God can not accept my worship as
[1:37:31] husband if I'm doing it my way it's got
[1:37:33] to be God's provided way
[1:37:35] amen and when it's God's provided way
[1:37:38] he's worshiped
[1:37:40] and this is my desire to worship Him
[1:37:44] amen this is my desire I have not know I
[1:37:48] have no desire to worship myself
[1:37:51] if if I didn't have to look at you I
[1:37:54] wouldn't
[1:37:56] if because I don't want you to see me
[1:37:59] because I don't want you to think well
[1:38:01] this is a great preacher I'm not a great
[1:38:03] preacher God's the preacher
[1:38:06] I'm not a revealer of the word God's the
[1:38:10] revealer of the word
[1:38:11] amen let's not get tangled up in in big
[1:38:14] names and self-image and and
[1:38:16] insecurities etc etc all we're going to
[1:38:19] do is repeat what they did with the
[1:38:20] prophet we don't want that today amen we
[1:38:23] want people to see God and God alone and
[1:38:26] understand that it's God behind a veil
[1:38:28] it's God operating behind a veil it's
[1:38:31] God standing in your office it's God is
[1:38:34] a wife it's God is a father it's God is
[1:38:36] a son it's God as a daughter it's God is
[1:38:38] a grandmother a grandfather it's God as
[1:38:41] a pastor it's guarded the deacon
[1:38:44] amen that that's that's what we're here
[1:38:47] that's how he is worshiped
[1:38:51] amen it's not me it's him
[1:38:54] isn't that what the prophet struggled so
[1:38:57] hard
[1:38:58] for the people to see
[1:39:01] it's not me doing these things
[1:39:04] I was just there when he came along
[1:39:08] amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:39:11] today and forever it's not me who's
[1:39:14] doing these things
[1:39:16] I was just here when he come along
[1:39:19] amen amen this is my story
[1:39:23] amen this is my song God chooses people
[1:39:27] who it's it's not in their natural
[1:39:29] ability to be what God wants them to be
[1:39:34] yes sir he does I'm a testimony of that
[1:39:37] God chooses people that it's not their
[1:39:40] natural ability to speak to speak
[1:39:43] yeah he chose Moses right Moses made all
[1:39:47] types of excuses about his speech
[1:39:48] impediment but God said hey Moses who
[1:39:51] made the tongue
[1:39:52] uh and this is this is God's choice
[1:39:56] and God's choice as God has chosen his
[1:39:59] bride
[1:40:00] and she looks at herself and thinks why
[1:40:04] why why would why would he choose me
[1:40:08] to be his bride I mean I I have nothing
[1:40:12] Brethren talks about the ranches son and
[1:40:14] how he went looking for a wife and
[1:40:15] there's all these fine women on the
[1:40:17] Dance Floor Etc and he's sitting at the
[1:40:19] back standing out the back leaning
[1:40:20] against the fence and washed woman comes
[1:40:23] out
[1:40:24] she throws the dishwater over the fence
[1:40:26] and he didn't know she didn't know he
[1:40:28] was there
[1:40:30] then the prophet of God says she was
[1:40:32] holding the dish pan up like this and
[1:40:35] she she dropped it down
[1:40:37] because she was ashamed
[1:40:40] and she had no feet no shoes on her feet
[1:40:42] she tried to what what why why would you
[1:40:46] choose me and not these other fine
[1:40:48] ladies
[1:40:50] God God chooses who he wants to choose
[1:40:56] and and we're not the bride because of
[1:40:59] of any great qualification that we have
[1:41:02] or education or specification
[1:41:06] well just the bright because he chose us
[1:41:08] to be the bride
[1:41:09] I mean he chose you before the
[1:41:11] foundation of the world
[1:41:13] to fulfill the last part of his Earthly
[1:41:16] Ministry through
[1:41:18] yeah and and I I Can't Tell You Why
[1:41:22] I can't explain to you why
[1:41:25] you explain to me why God chose the uh
[1:41:28] the prophet with a seventh grade
[1:41:30] education to be the prophet to be the
[1:41:33] voice
[1:41:34] to the Lord to the church age
[1:41:37] oh you can't explain it there's no well
[1:41:39] it's because of this or because no it's
[1:41:41] just God chose him
[1:41:43] and that's as far as our understanding
[1:41:46] goes and if our understanding is in
[1:41:49] anything else then just put it aside
[1:41:52] because why look Abraham didn't plead
[1:41:55] with God and say God I don't know why
[1:41:58] you chose that mountain it's three days
[1:42:00] journey there's one just here or this
[1:42:02] one's prettier or this one's higher or
[1:42:04] this one's got a a bit of a unique rock
[1:42:07] on it you know why didn't you chose this
[1:42:09] one or why didn't you choose that one
[1:42:10] Abraham said Lord if that's the mountain
[1:42:13] you chose then that's the mountain I'm
[1:42:15] going to and we've got to come to the
[1:42:17] same conclusion if God chose me who am I
[1:42:20] to question who he chose I was going to
[1:42:22] accept his choice and say Lord if you
[1:42:25] chose me then praise God I accept your
[1:42:28] choice
[1:42:28] [Applause]
[1:42:29] [Music]
[1:42:32] I just don't know I'm so humble I just
[1:42:35] don't know if I can accept God's choice
[1:42:37] that's not humility
[1:42:39] there's not a humble bone in your body
[1:42:41] that's Pro that's false humility that's
[1:42:44] Pride you need to humble yourself to
[1:42:47] God's choice say Lord here I am
[1:42:50] Here I Am Lord if if I'm your choice
[1:42:53] then I'm your perfect choice
[1:42:56] somebody tell me why God chose Gideon
[1:43:00] of all the men he could have chosen
[1:43:03] why did God choose Sarah who was barren
[1:43:11] his choice
[1:43:13] and he proved his choice was right
[1:43:15] amen and God proved
[1:43:19] that the place
[1:43:21] that he had chosen Abraham to worship
[1:43:24] Him
[1:43:25] was right
[1:43:28] because in that place
[1:43:30] all things are possible
[1:43:32] amen and God is going to choose God is
[1:43:35] going to prove not that we need the
[1:43:37] proof
[1:43:38] but God will prove his bride to be the
[1:43:42] right choice
[1:43:43] amen he will prove that even though to
[1:43:47] the to the carnal mind she's
[1:43:49] insignificant she's this and that she's
[1:43:51] mixed up she's whatever whatever
[1:43:52] whatever God is going to prove
[1:43:56] that she is his perfect choice
[1:44:01] because how can God have an imperfect
[1:44:04] choice
[1:44:07] amen you've got to have a revelation of
[1:44:10] of who is speaking
[1:44:13] he chose you before the foundation of
[1:44:16] the world he chose you in him before the
[1:44:19] foundation of the world
[1:44:20] amen don't argue with God's choice just
[1:44:24] accept God's choice
[1:44:26] amen
[1:44:29] what did God do to Abraham
[1:44:34] he brought him to a position of full
[1:44:36] maturity
[1:44:38] in the office that God had placed him in
[1:44:42] I believe that that's exactly what God
[1:44:44] desires for each one of us
[1:44:48] God desires us to come to full maturity
[1:44:53] in the office that we hold
[1:44:56] I cannot be a successful father
[1:45:01] if I father to the level that my father
[1:45:03] passed fathered
[1:45:09] it's not going to work
[1:45:11] it's not going to work
[1:45:13] but God won't allow me to be that
[1:45:18] because he's opened the word the word
[1:45:20] has opened
[1:45:22] since then
[1:45:23] amen allowing me to become a better
[1:45:27] father
[1:45:28] than my father
[1:45:30] it's not that my father didn't live to
[1:45:32] his potential he did
[1:45:35] put the potential our potential is the
[1:45:37] opening of the word
[1:45:39] and he lived to the potential that the
[1:45:41] word that the word was open to
[1:45:44] and now we are the opening of the word
[1:45:48] is progressively continually unfolding
[1:45:51] to me I don't know where you are I can't
[1:45:54] really speak for you and honestly I'm
[1:45:56] not meant to speak for you I'm just
[1:45:58] meant to speak from my own experience
[1:46:00] about what the Lord is doing in my life
[1:46:02] and he's he's progressively opening the
[1:46:05] word to me amen that the seals are off
[1:46:08] the book the book is open the contents
[1:46:11] of the book are becoming a greater and
[1:46:13] greater Revelation to me every day that
[1:46:15] I live and I pray that God that that I
[1:46:19] am becoming a greater and greater
[1:46:20] husband and father I I want to be a
[1:46:23] better father today than what I was
[1:46:25] yesterday I want to be a better husband
[1:46:27] today than what I was yesterday
[1:46:30] amen and that that's that's that's my
[1:46:33] desire and it's something that God
[1:46:35] desires for me God desires a higher
[1:46:39] level of worship
[1:46:41] from from me than he did from my father
[1:46:47] higher level of worship
[1:46:50] amen
[1:46:52] God requires God desires for me to
[1:46:56] overcome
[1:46:58] me
[1:47:00] at a greater level than my father
[1:47:03] overcome himself
[1:47:05] when we overcome ourself
[1:47:08] we worship
[1:47:11] amen Abraham had to overcome himself
[1:47:16] with with every inch that he's hand
[1:47:19] raised he was overcoming
[1:47:22] overcoming
[1:47:23] because of that same knife that he was
[1:47:26] prepared to thrust through Isaac's chest
[1:47:28] could have Cut the Ropes loose
[1:47:32] but instead of dropping the knife
[1:47:34] he raised the knife
[1:47:37] he raised the noise
[1:47:39] with every inch that he raised that
[1:47:41] knife he was overcoming himself
[1:47:45] amen and the greatest thing that I need
[1:47:48] to overcome it's not covert it's me
[1:47:51] it's not the church it's me
[1:47:54] amen it's not anyone else's problems
[1:47:56] it's me
[1:47:58] amen and as I overcome myself
[1:48:03] I'm worshiping
[1:48:05] I'm worshiping
[1:48:07] amen so God God give us the grace God
[1:48:10] give us the the the the the things that
[1:48:13] we need
[1:48:14] to
[1:48:16] fully Express
[1:48:18] him in this hour
[1:48:21] amen I I believe that we're coming to a
[1:48:24] place where undeniably
[1:48:26] it's it's not God it's not God being
[1:48:31] uh sorry it's not me being a husband to
[1:48:34] my wife
[1:48:37] but it's God in Me
[1:48:39] and I believe the same for my wife well
[1:48:42] it's it's it's not her
[1:48:44] being a wife to me
[1:48:46] it's God in her
[1:48:49] expressing himself
[1:48:51] through her
[1:48:52] to me as wife
[1:48:56] as husband
[1:48:58] amen you love him
[1:49:01] amen
[1:49:03] God's desire for you
[1:49:06] God's desire for you is to
[1:49:08] in in
[1:49:10] to reach full maturity
[1:49:13] amen
[1:49:15] there's a lot of overcoming
[1:49:17] that we need to do
[1:49:20] but you're looking at what I need to
[1:49:23] overcome
[1:49:27] okay you're looking at what I need to
[1:49:30] overcome

[1:49:34] to overcome

[1:54:20] thinking there must be a whole lot more
[1:54:22] of God to be revealed to me because I'm
[1:54:25] far from where I want to be
[1:54:27] amen there's I don't believe any of us
[1:54:30] feel like we've come to the level that
[1:54:31] we want to be in Christ
[1:54:33] come to that Perfection as a son or a
[1:54:36] daughter of God but I'm so thankful that
[1:54:39] there's more of Christ to be revealed
