[0:00] so now we know where did where did
[0:02] Michelangelo get this image that he was
[0:04] going to model this this sculpture after
[0:06] it came by inspiration and it came as an
[0:09] image by inspiration in his mind of what
[0:11] Moses looked like it's important brother
[0:13] Brandon he's trying to show us a type
[0:15] he's using this as a time so if we go to
[0:17] paragraph 44 at the bottom of page nine
[0:20] says now let us turn the page of
[0:22] Michelangelo and close the book and
[0:24] let's open another book and read of the
[0:26] great sculptor the almighty who before
[0:28] there was a world and before the
[0:30] foundations was laid he had in his mind
[0:32] what he wanted and he wanted to make he
[0:35] wanted to make man in his own image he
[0:37] wanted to make something in reality of
[0:39] what was a vision to him what was in his
[0:42] thinking so brother renam is just tying
[0:44] the two together and he's showing where
[0:45] did Michelangelo get the image that he
[0:48] was going to make the sculpt the the
[0:50] sculpture of Moses he got it from
[0:52] inspiration from his own mind where did
[0:54] God get the image of the great work he
[0:56] was doing it was in his mind so let's
[0:59] turn turn back to the beginning here on
[1:02] uh paragraph 33 page 7 bottom of page s
[1:06] there's something he says that I just
[1:07] want to reference we'll start right in
[1:10] the middle of this paragraph where it
[1:11] says and see and see only the man the
[1:14] sculptor himself has in his mind what
[1:16] he's trying to do he is the one you
[1:19] might walk up and say to him what are
[1:21] you pecking on that rock for to The
[1:23] Outsider who doesn't know what's in his
[1:24] heart it's nonsense but to the man the
[1:26] sculptor himself he's got a vision in
[1:28] his mind of what he's trying to
[1:31] make amen I love that God already has in
[1:36] his mind the image of you and I he knows
[1:39] what he's trying to do with his bride he
[1:41] knows what he's been doing over seven
[1:42] Church ages he knows what it's going to
[1:44] look like at the End Amen and and along
[1:46] the way it may not be clear and we may
[1:49] question why this age and why did this
[1:51] happen and why did this go right and why
[1:52] did this go wrong through the seven
[1:54] Church ages we look at it that way but
[1:56] the sculptor has in his mind by
[1:58] inspiration by a vision he already knows
[2:01] what he's going to produce and every
[2:02] stroke has the one object in mind to
[2:05] bring it to this conclusion and the same
[2:07] thing in our life God already has a
[2:09] design in his mind for the way we're
[2:11] going to look at the end of our life's
[2:13] journey and we may not understand every
[2:15] stroke and sometimes we've asked God why
[2:17] why why did you do
[2:19] that why the Chisel right there and why
[2:22] so deep why did you cut so deep and why
[2:25] did you knock such a big chunk
[2:27] off but he already has the Vision in his
[2:30] mind and every stroke every stroke has
[2:35] that vision in mind and he's working it
[2:37] to one goal and that's so he gets you
[2:40] and I in the image he had of us before
[2:42] the foundation of the world praise God
[2:46] what's so beautiful about that is we
[2:47] have trials we have tribulations we have
[2:49] difficulties but he saw me finished
[2:52] before the foundation of the world
[2:53] there's no fear in me not finishing
[2:55] because the master the master Craftsman
[2:58] the master artist is on the job and he
[3:01] knows how hard to strike where to strike
[3:03] where to polish when to beat and when to
[3:06] rub and there's no chance that I won't
[3:09] come into that image because he's
[3:11] working by
[3:13] inspiration
