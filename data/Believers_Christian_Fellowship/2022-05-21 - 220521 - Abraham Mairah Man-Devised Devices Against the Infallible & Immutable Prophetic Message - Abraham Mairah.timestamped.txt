[18:32] wonderful men's fellowship breakfast for
[18:34] all the brothers that were there we had
[18:36] a wonderful time
[18:37] and we appreciate
[18:39] brother donovan and sister stephanie
[18:40] fisher for hosting that and all those
[18:42] who helped him my brother dan ratliff
[18:44] shared some testimony with us and it was

[19:08] many of you come expecting
[19:11] you'll meet that expectation
[19:13] have you come to receive amen if we've
[19:15] come if we understand what god has
[19:17] taught us in this age and how he speaks
[19:20] to us and how he communicates to his
[19:21] children then we know we've got to reach
[19:23] beyond the veil of flesh because that's
[19:26] just a conduit
[19:27] we've got to pull down from heaven what
[19:29] we have need of tonight but there's
[19:31] going to be a channel standing in the
[19:32] pulpit and if you need something from
[19:34] the lord god can speak through those
[19:36] lips
[19:37] if we believe that we'll receive the
[19:39] benefit of that if we can receive it
[19:42] many just want to remind you there'll be
[19:44] a fellowship in the fellowship hall

[20:07] the light that he shines and the
[20:09] ministry that god's entrusted him with
[20:11] we're thankful that he's yielded to that
[20:14] and we're the beneficiaries of that this
[20:16] time

[21:37] special privilege
[21:38] to live for him
[21:40] and who are we that he called us to live
[21:43] that kind of life
[21:45] you know there is always that popular
[21:46] saying life is short enjoy it to the
[21:48] fullest
[21:50] but i am glad that i don't have that
[21:52] short life
[21:55] i have a long one an internal one
[21:59] and i'm not in a hurry
[22:01] so even if there is a little piercings
[22:04] here and there i know i've just begun
[22:07] and the better the best is here to come
[22:11] so
[22:13] we are really privileged to be in the
[22:14] house of the lord this evening again
[22:16] and um

[22:20] the fellowship with the brother in the
[22:22] morning it was wonderful
[22:24] and of course you people have a charming
[22:27] way of fellowship
[22:28] you are so special
[22:30] so i was telling the brother if it was
[22:32] possible just migrate and become your
[22:34] assistant pastor

[24:40] the perfect way that you found it for
[24:43] this day
[24:44] and bless the reading of your word in
[24:46] our hearts
[24:47] in jesus name we pray
[24:49] amen
[24:52] so just turning to our bibles before you
[24:54] sit down i
[24:56] i wanted us to read this uh scripture in
[24:58] the book of jeremiah
[25:01] chapter 18
[25:05] and i wanted to start
[25:08] from verse
[25:10] 18.
[25:22] then say today
[25:26] come
[25:27] let us devise
[25:29] devices
[25:32] against jeremiah
[25:37] for the law shall not perish
[25:43] from the priest
[25:44] nor they can't no counsel from the wise
[25:49] nor the word from the prophet
[25:53] come and let us might him with the tank
[25:59] let us not let us not give heed to any
[26:03] of his words
[26:05] look at such
[26:07] a plot
[26:15] give heed to me oh lord and hearken to
[26:18] the voice of them
[26:21] that contend
[26:23] with me that now is
[26:25] jeremiah's prayer
[26:28] in answer to that
[26:33] because i'm rejected
[26:35] by reason of the word
[26:38] then give heed to me
[26:46] and verse 20 says shall evil be
[26:50] recompessed for good
[26:52] for they have digged a pit
[26:55] for my soul
[26:57] remember that i stood before thee to
[27:00] speak
[27:01] good for them
[27:04] and to turn away
[27:06] thy wrath from them
[27:11] so this was
[27:12] the ministry of jeremiah
[27:15] and if there is any prophet who was
[27:17] really persuaded unfold
[27:19] jeremiah was one of them beaten thrown
[27:22] into pits
[27:26] and gentiles would
[27:28] be
[27:28] sympathetic
[27:30] with jeremiah
[27:33] not the jews
[27:38] but i wanted us to compare it with what
[27:40] we we have in the book of amos
[27:45] amos chapter 7.
[27:51] emmaus chapter seven i wanted to pick it
[27:53] from verse um
[27:57] i think let's begin from verse 12.
[28:04] also a messiah
[28:07] say that amos
[28:10] and you remember this a messiah was a
[28:12] priest and a priest is the equivalent of
[28:14] today's pastor
[28:15] a preacher
[28:19] and so he was a priest under the
[28:21] prophetic minister of
[28:24] amos
[28:25] but you see what a pastor is saying
[28:31] also a messiah said that amos
[28:34] oh thou seer
[28:36] go
[28:37] free thee away into the land of judah
[28:41] and there eat bread and
[28:43] there
[28:47] but prophesy not again anymore at bethel
[28:53] for it is the king's chapel and is the
[28:56] king is caught
[28:59] then he answered the almost and said
[29:01] unto
[29:02] a messiah
[29:05] i was no prophet
[29:08] neither was i a prophetess son
[29:11] but i was a han and hardman
[29:13] and the gatherer of comor fruit
[29:17] and the lord took me
[29:19] as i followed the flock and the lord
[29:22] said unto me go prophesy unto my people
[29:26] israel
[29:29] may god bless this world and bless you
[29:31] may be seated
[29:36] and just following up on what we're
[29:38] trying to share yesterday
[29:45] when you fail to get ahold of reality
[29:48] that is
[29:50] beyond a prophetic office
[29:53] when you begin to focus on the prophet
[29:57] that which you valued reaches the time
[30:00] that you begin to see false
[30:03] you begin to fight it
[30:05] you begin to resist it
[30:08] a messiah the priest
[30:11] who was close with amos who worked with
[30:13] amos
[30:15] turns around and said leave this place
[30:18] we don't want hear you prophesy here
[30:21] anymore
[30:22] go to judah
[30:25] by that time remember israel was divided
[30:27] into two
[30:30] the ten tribes versus the the
[30:34] two sorry he's telling the prophet go
[30:38] and prophesy to those not here
[30:43] we don't need you here anymore
[30:48] and look at
[30:49] the kind of response that the prophet is
[30:51] saying he says
[30:54] i was no prophet
[30:59] lord oh god
[31:01] i was no prophet
[31:02] neither was i a prophetess son i never
[31:06] became a prophet i don't belong to a
[31:09] higher rank of prophets
[31:13] i was not a prophet by the floor
[31:16] it was not my intention to be a prophet
[31:19] i never wanted to be a prophet
[31:24] i was gathering scam of fruit
[31:28] i was the herdsman
[31:29] i was looking after qatar
[31:34] so it's not my fault
[31:37] being a prophet
[31:42] it wasn't in my plans i never intended
[31:46] it to be one
[31:48] but i found myself i am one by the lord
[31:52] is calling so i never called myself he
[31:55] called me i never gave him a gift that
[31:58] he gives it back to me he gave me the
[32:00] gift he called me
[32:02] i answered
[32:03] and i am what i am by his own decision
[32:07] not because i want it
[32:10] so today i'm going to speak in the
[32:12] fields
[32:13] of the prophet in the friends of the
[32:15] pastors and in defense of believers
[32:19] genuine believers that is
[32:22] so that where you are you should know in
[32:26] this fluid situation that we are in
[32:28] before we go home
[32:30] how do you place your stand
[32:34] whom do you look to
[32:36] to whom are you accountable
[32:39] whom are you here to please why are you
[32:42] here anyway
[32:48] and i'm talking about man device devices
[32:51] against
[32:53] the inferible and immutable prophetic
[32:56] message
[33:00] let us devise devices against jeremiah
[33:04] who is jeremiah
[33:07] but just because god's mouthpiece
[33:10] did he send himself no
[33:14] did he want to be a prophet no
[33:16] did he train himself no you remember
[33:19] jeremiah was even giving an excuse i'm
[33:21] just a younger man i don't know how to
[33:23] speak lord why did you call me and god
[33:25] said i'm going to be with your mouth i'm
[33:27] going to give you words to speak
[33:33] jeremiah didn't want to do it
[33:35] god told him you have to do it you
[33:38] didn't want to be a believer you cannot
[33:40] even convince me brother brother abraham
[33:42] i wanted to be i
[33:44] even if you say i love the god it's not
[33:47] you who wanted to love god
[33:50] the prophet says you are not the
[33:51] believer it's the holy ghost in you that
[33:54] is the believer
[33:57] so
[33:58] if if you are wrong for being a believer
[34:01] you are a victim and i'm a victim for
[34:03] being a preacher
[34:06] i'm not the culprit
[34:08] because i never sent myself
[34:13] and you never wanted to be a servant of
[34:16] the lord and now don't be ashamed of
[34:19] what you are because of what they say
[34:22] about you
[34:24] don't even feel belittled
[34:27] of course they will belittle you they'll
[34:29] speak a lot of negative words about you
[34:32] but you're not responsible for that
[34:34] you are just what you are because god
[34:37] wanted you to be what you are
[34:40] and the devil wants you to begin to
[34:42] develop some negative sentimental
[34:46] reactions about what you are
[34:50] come on this is a time to know
[34:53] that these things have to be
[34:56] [Applause]
[34:59] so now there is a mystery why
[35:03] this forces are rising up
[35:05] and then if you are living in such a day
[35:08] thank god that you are living in such a
[35:10] day that jeremiah evening
[35:14] almost lived in
[35:16] moses lived in
[35:18] all these great prophets and even
[35:20] brother branningham lived with them
[35:23] so who are you
[35:26] why do you think you'll be an exception
[35:29] should you fret
[35:31] why should you think you're going to
[35:33] freak out
[35:37] you are going to face the music you are
[35:40] the person
[35:41] god all heaven is looking after you
[35:46] glory to god
[35:48] oh brother jack brother chad i wish i
[35:50] was a good preacher
[35:54] glory be to god
[35:56] now if we can go back to the book of
[35:58] jeremiah i want us to examine
[36:01] the way they framed it
[36:04] jeremiah chapter 18 verse 18 there are
[36:06] reasons why
[36:08] they have to smite the prophet with a
[36:11] tank
[36:14] they can't do anything else
[36:16] they will use intellectualism
[36:20] they are good orators good speakers
[36:25] so they smite
[36:27] the prophetic office with the tank
[36:31] because what was dangerous to them also
[36:34] came by the tank
[36:39] the prophet is god his mouth's peace
[36:41] it was the word of god through him
[36:44] so what do you expect the devil to do
[36:46] also smite you back by the tank
[36:49] because what comes through the tank is
[36:51] the enemies
[36:52] what the enemy doesn't want to hear
[36:57] blessed be the name of the lord so he
[36:59] says and they say come so it is a they
[37:04] it's not he say
[37:06] it's a group
[37:10] so you think you should be surprised
[37:11] that there is a group
[37:17] no
[37:18] they said come
[37:20] they
[37:21] they got that together
[37:24] they formed the group
[37:26] they say come
[37:29] and let us devise devices
[37:37] let us devise devices
[37:42] and if if
[37:44] of course english is not my language you
[37:46] know what it defines devices
[37:48] and to device
[37:50] place a strategy some kind of plan
[37:55] plot
[37:57] let us have a scheme or a project
[38:00] designed to receive to counter
[38:07] an artifice
[38:08] a technique
[38:12] that we we the office thereof are going
[38:15] to use to or to speak to use in a way to
[38:19] present that will evoke
[38:22] emotional response
[38:24] from the audience
[38:27] against what they believed was right
[38:33] so some kind of rhetoric rhetorical
[38:36] device
[38:38] that they are devising a device and this
[38:40] device is oral
[38:46] and they are saying and they said come
[38:48] and let us devise devices against
[38:50] jeremiah
[38:53] what is wrong with jeremiah
[38:56] what crime what evil
[38:59] blinded
[39:01] they failed to get ahold of the reality
[39:03] that going beyond jeremiah they stuck at
[39:06] the office of jeremiah they looked at
[39:08] jeremiah as their problem jeremiah
[39:11] became their problem
[39:18] so that's why yesterday we were saying
[39:20] go beyond that office
[39:22] and when you are like
[39:24] when you become like john i mean james
[39:27] and andrew those two disciples of john
[39:29] the baptist who had himself behold the
[39:32] lamb of god and caught the revelation
[39:34] and immediately went beyond the
[39:36] introducer to the introduced
[39:38] they never bothered what they are saying
[39:41] anymore about the other office
[39:43] they had already left
[39:45] glory to god and when you got where
[39:47] jesus is you are in union with him you
[39:51] have gone to see the home you are in
[39:53] heavenly places with him you are lost
[39:55] you are taken away in the inner veil you
[39:57] are with him having communion with him
[39:59] you don't even hear what they are saying
[40:01] about the office this way
[40:04] it doesn't even affect you but you have
[40:07] to know that these devices are there
[40:14] and what should be the standard against
[40:16] them
[40:18] so it's a project
[40:21] certainly made
[40:22] project
[40:24] and it's involving a group and this
[40:26] group must be people who know exactly
[40:29] what the minister of jeremiah is
[40:33] they are convinced
[40:35] maybe they are
[40:36] contemporaries maybe they have grown up
[40:39] in his message
[40:42] they know some history
[40:46] and they can piece this up and piece it
[40:49] up and remember
[40:51] those scientists that popped up
[40:54] in the dream that brother abraham was
[40:56] rehearsing from a certain brother who
[40:58] told him
[40:59] he says when he was saying i'll ride
[41:01] this trail once more i was preaching
[41:03] that reason to somewhere in kenya i'll
[41:06] ride in this trail once more what
[41:08] happened
[41:10] he says there was a bunch of scientists
[41:13] in a room
[41:14] mixing things in tested tubes and they
[41:17] shrugged their shoulders
[41:19] and then my question was why should a
[41:21] bunch of scientists arise on the scene
[41:24] where the prophet is saying i'll ride
[41:25] this trail once more and who is going to
[41:28] ride it once more brother brother will
[41:29] not rise up to ride it it's the spirit
[41:32] that was in the prophet that is upon the
[41:34] elijah's the other brother was with him
[41:37] in a vision that is going to ride again
[41:39] and then the scientists are busy testing
[41:43] researching
[41:46] trying to prove that this man is wrong
[41:48] to smite him with a tank and the prophet
[41:51] he says the next day being a son i
[41:53] preached on science being of the devil
[41:56] but why were the scientists appearing in
[41:58] that dream
[42:00] at the time when he's saying i'll ride
[42:02] in this trail once more and they are
[42:05] there in the room
[42:08] scientists
[42:10] researchers
[42:12] let's piece this and bring this and
[42:14] bring this fault and this that and this
[42:17] didn't happen this happened this was not
[42:19] fulfilled this was not complete this was
[42:21] not done piss this up piss this up and
[42:24] bring out and smite him with a tank
[42:29] prove to their followers that they are
[42:31] following a wrong thing
[42:34] smile jeremiah
[42:36] what has he done he was just got his
[42:38] mouth peace
[42:43] lord of god
[42:46] that's why jesus was not a scientist
[42:49] so when when when the disciples of
[42:51] johnny came jesus didn't
[42:53] put him in his binoculars and maybe
[42:58] is what
[43:00] his microscope
[43:02] to say look at such a man
[43:05] he began well
[43:07] he ascended party isn't that the way
[43:09] they speak about the prophet
[43:11] he began anywhere else
[43:13] now you see being in the in the in the
[43:15] prison he's asking about the very
[43:18] ministry that he introduced and he's
[43:20] sending people to ask are you the one or
[43:23] should we look for another
[43:27] he didn't mention that
[43:29] he said he was more than a prophet and
[43:32] he over all that were born of women no
[43:35] one is greater than johnny baptist
[43:38] positive positive positive because he
[43:41] knows whatever mistake john made
[43:46] whatever fault
[43:49] however many i mean
[43:51] it doesn't mean matter how many people
[43:54] he offended they were offended because
[43:57] heaven sent to him
[44:02] heaven is sent to him
[44:05] glory be to god
[44:07] and heaven cannot condemn you for what
[44:10] it sent you for
[44:15] they only pick the positives and leave
[44:17] the other ones
[44:19] you know our god is so merciful that he
[44:21] does not put a cross on where you fail
[44:24] he just leaves that and takes where you
[44:26] are right
[44:31] and he fills up the patches and says by
[44:33] grace you are 100 percent
[44:37] but even if you are not 100
[44:40] you can be 40 percent but that tree is
[44:42] not condemned
[44:43] some brought forth is it 40 percent
[44:46] other 60 percent
[44:48] other has a hundred but they are all
[44:50] qualified
[44:54] blessed be the name of the lord so let
[44:57] us come together let us devise devices
[45:00] against jeremiah
[45:01] listen
[45:02] point number one why must we devise
[45:06] devices
[45:07] one the lord shall not perish from the
[45:12] priest
[45:18] the
[45:18] some priests have picked up that
[45:22] some preachers
[45:25] have caught the vision they have stuck
[45:28] with it
[45:29] and whether we work it or not
[45:33] they will continue preaching this
[45:41] so we cannot stop them from preaching
[45:44] what we do is tarnish what they are
[45:46] preaching
[45:50] because we can't stop the law
[45:54] it cannot cease
[45:56] it cannot die from the priesthood called
[45:59] the revelation there are some priests
[46:04] who have called this revelation
[46:07] glory to god and i thank god brother
[46:09] charlie should be one of them that you
[46:11] are still standing with the word as it
[46:14] was handed over
[46:19] preach it man
[46:22] glory be oh god whether the devil wants
[46:24] it or not
[46:26] friends or no friends
[46:28] associates oh no associates
[46:31] collaborators are not collaborators as
[46:33] long as heaven is saying yes
[46:37] as long as somebody here is getting
[46:40] ready to go in the rupture
[46:43] as long as the spirit of god is moving
[46:45] here
[46:47] they are not going to stop some priests
[46:50] there are some priests somewhere who are
[46:52] still standing with the word who are
[46:54] still standing with the message and they
[46:55] know it they never knows it so he wants
[46:58] to tarnish
[47:01] reason number one
[47:02] the law is not going to perish from the
[47:04] priest
[47:05] amen
[47:07] so we must find a way to stop this
[47:10] there are some people who are more
[47:11] serious than we thought
[47:14] there are some people who have known it
[47:16] deeper than we expected
[47:18] there are some people who are going to
[47:19] eat until they have become meat
[47:22] what are we doing how do what do we do
[47:24] about this
[47:27] we must put a stop on this
[47:30] by confusing them and making them busy
[47:33] to compare these such this
[47:36] whether it's wrong or right taking you
[47:38] backwards
[47:40] i'm not going to go back to begin to
[47:42] search about a message whether it's
[47:44] right or wrong and the prophet says you
[47:46] know a true believer you know he goes
[47:49] beyond right and wrong because he has
[47:51] got a revelation
[47:56] that's why john the baptist never was
[47:58] not very clear that's why i said he
[48:00] could have told the disciples who who
[48:03] were with him he said i introduced this
[48:05] man follow this man he didn't say that
[48:08] they had to follow my revelation
[48:12] he remained with them
[48:14] but they too
[48:16] left
[48:19] so why do we remain with you you have
[48:21] said you must decrease he must increase
[48:23] he's the alarm you are the introducer
[48:25] now we are gone the two left the others
[48:27] remain he didn't trust them
[48:32] like we said yesterday so the problem is
[48:34] remaining at the office and so when you
[48:36] remain at office unfortunately for us we
[48:38] are still in this world we can still
[48:40] hear from
[48:42] the reality himself jesus christ
[48:45] he's dealing with us
[48:48] he's in the temple but also we can hear
[48:51] what they are speaking about the office
[48:57] so if you don't know where you are
[48:59] standing they they send the statements
[49:03] the rhetoric the negative statements
[49:05] about the office can begin to work on
[49:07] you psychologically spiritually can try
[49:10] to sort of your spiritual growth
[49:12] you begin to once you begin to question
[49:15] that's what the devil wants
[49:18] taking you back to the drawing board
[49:24] so what the devil has failed
[49:27] is convincing all priests
[49:30] away from the world
[49:34] there are some priests
[49:37] and they are confessing it they know it
[49:39] they know the word this message he's not
[49:43] going to cease from some priests
[49:46] some priests are very serious
[49:49] they are very dedicated to it
[49:51] so what do we do device devices
[50:00] device devices against jeremiah you can
[50:02] call him brother branham you can call
[50:04] him whatever can you call him malakai
[50:06] for or elijah
[50:10] he's also a prophet this age
[50:12] he did his work
[50:15] so now this what the days of the voice
[50:19] so what do we do again to silence the
[50:21] voice device devices
[50:24] because there are some people who have
[50:25] taken this voice very seriously
[50:27] some preachers and not only some
[50:29] preachers but some believers
[50:31] some people are still ready to say amen
[50:35] they are ready to take it regardless
[50:38] and you are not going to convince them
[50:39] out they are anchored they are
[50:41] established
[50:42] so what do we do about these people
[50:45] [Applause]
[50:52] the lord will not perish from the priest
[50:55] that's part one two
[50:57] the council
[51:00] from there wise
[51:03] there are some people who
[51:05] are
[51:05] wise
[51:07] they have identified
[51:09] reality
[51:10] they are not not devil's fools
[51:15] well if i'm a fool there am i full of
[51:17] jesus christ
[51:18] [Music]
[51:20] call me an idiot
[51:22] but it's up to you and down to me
[51:25] i don't care
[51:31] but the council
[51:34] the council that's revelation
[51:38] to the wise
[51:39] the wise of the the age we are talking
[51:42] about is not just your wisdom i'm
[51:44] talking about it the wisdom by
[51:46] revelation
[51:47] that counseling by the spirit the groom
[51:50] counseling the bride and they having
[51:53] communion
[51:54] sweet communion between them
[52:01] there is that sweetness
[52:04] they are not fools they are ready to be
[52:06] deceived they are not cheap
[52:09] they are not going for achievable
[52:10] popularity they know where they are
[52:12] standing
[52:14] they are wise
[52:15] they are the wise virgins they have got
[52:18] oil they keep checking themselves all
[52:20] the time am i fit am i fit is there a
[52:23] problem can i fix something god jesus
[52:26] come and fix me up fill me up refill me
[52:28] refill me the hours on the watch out
[52:31] they are wise
[52:33] you are not going to follow them
[52:35] they know who they are waiting for they
[52:37] know whom they are serving they know
[52:38] where they are going
[52:45] so those with wise people
[52:47] what do we do with them
[52:53] they are not foolish virgins
[52:56] that can relax and have some good time
[53:02] well well well
[53:04] um sometimes you have to put these
[53:06] things from the what they want aside and
[53:08] enjoy life you know and they don't have
[53:11] time for that
[53:14] they are watching
[53:16] their garment they are
[53:18] trimming and feeling and checking and
[53:21] wading and observing
[53:26] and the devil knows you are there
[53:30] so you think that judas carrier today
[53:31] was not supposed to be here
[53:33] they are supposed to be here
[53:35] that's why the worst enemies of the
[53:37] message are the ones who were once
[53:39] message believers
[53:42] they know all the weaknesses and you
[53:44] know he went so close to jesus until he
[53:46] could know how jesus eats
[53:50] because they were eating in the same
[53:51] blood
[53:53] gotten used to him
[53:57] they know so much about him
[54:03] and they have
[54:04] they can convince the people i mean you
[54:06] could mistake him
[54:08] i mean peter to be the person who would
[54:11] be
[54:11] you know betraying jesus not judas he
[54:13] was very smart smart guy humble
[54:16] respectful very close
[54:18] attentive
[54:21] but with a hidden agenda
[54:28] so
[54:29] i mean we are supposed to be wise
[54:31] virginis isn't it
[54:33] so that's why he is saying
[54:35] the council will not cease from the wise
[54:39] now listen neither the word from there
[54:43] perfect
[54:47] so the prophetic message still lives
[54:53] the tips the books
[54:55] are there
[54:57] and you cannot change it
[54:59] i mean you can tell someone he made
[55:01] errors but people are able to go and sit
[55:03] and listen
[55:06] oh
[55:07] i'm not going to be just
[55:09] deceived so easily and so cheaply i was
[55:12] bought by a very expensive price
[55:16] so you are not going to deceive me very
[55:18] cheaply
[55:21] i'm very expensive
[55:25] glory be to god
[55:30] so what do we do
[55:32] what do we do about these three classes
[55:34] of people
[55:35] the priest is
[55:36] strong
[55:38] with the word
[55:42] and then the wives are also there still
[55:45] wise
[55:47] and the prophetic message is still there
[55:50] so what do we do
[55:52] this device divides us
[55:57] come and let us smite him who the
[56:00] prophet target source of the message
[56:04] source of the word the revealed word
[56:07] when we target the prophet not the
[56:09] priests
[56:10] not the wise ones
[56:14] the
[56:15] prophet jeremiah
[56:17] let us smite him
[56:20] with the tank
[56:23] and let us
[56:24] not give heed to any of his
[56:28] words
[56:32] that's the whole thing
[56:36] so we must create an excuse of not
[56:38] obeying his word
[56:41] by making it appear false
[56:49] that is the device
[56:52] devised
[56:55] by the
[56:56] enemies
[56:58] of the world
[57:07] to fail these avenues
[57:12] but the problem is
[57:15] i think sometimes you have to sit and
[57:17] sympathize with the devil
[57:20] because today through elect he has
[57:22] already left his office
[57:24] you speak a lot of words about his
[57:26] office as we said yesterday he's beyond
[57:28] there
[57:30] and you're not bothering him
[57:36] blessed be the name of the lord
[57:39] so now you have to look at this because
[57:42] it is very interesting that
[57:45] in every age saturn will always use the
[57:47] people
[57:49] which people the intended beneficiaries
[57:52] of the god-given message to resist and
[57:54] fight the same
[57:58] so they devise devices smite him in the
[58:00] tank use intellectual reasoning against
[58:03] the message use some scientific research
[58:06] methodists
[58:08] that are convincing
[58:12] appealing to people's communications
[58:18] well i don't depend on communications
[58:22] that's why james i mean jew decided when
[58:25] i
[58:26] thought about writing to you about the
[58:28] common service
[58:31] i had to package it with that you also
[58:34] contend
[58:35] for the
[58:36] faith
[58:37] that was once delivered today saints
[58:41] so that faith makes you not common
[58:50] although you may have common salvation
[58:53] come you may be a common message
[58:55] believer
[58:57] and people will think well he's just a
[58:59] common man what does he know
[59:02] like maera here who is not even educated
[59:05] i mean
[59:06] just come
[59:08] just communicates he will finish him
[59:17] appealing to the communists
[59:19] psychologically
[59:23] right
[59:28] to silence this message
[59:30] make sure you are armed with all
[59:32] sufficient information or data
[59:37] so that whoever wants to rise in the
[59:40] face of the message you are capable of
[59:43] silencing him with some negative quote
[59:50] like i said yesterday
[59:56] what was in written in what we read in
[59:59] the bible
[1:00:00] is john saying i'm not elijah are you
[1:00:03] that elijah no
[1:00:06] but jesus comes and says if you are to
[1:00:10] receive it
[1:00:11] this was the elijah that was to come
[1:00:18] so that was for a bracketed special
[1:00:21] group of people who are designed to
[1:00:25] receive it
[1:00:27] the rest will end on the letter
[1:00:30] we had him verbatim it is on tape
[1:00:35] it's in the message book i can read you
[1:00:38] them what
[1:00:40] oh
[1:00:42] so what the prophet himself said
[1:00:46] can throw so many people but what about
[1:00:49] that which was revealed by the reality
[1:00:52] that he introduced
[1:00:56] so who do we believe
[1:01:00] now this is the time so if you are going
[1:01:02] to go by negative courts there are so
[1:01:04] many and i don't deny that one day
[1:01:07] and god permitted them to be there
[1:01:11] [Music]
[1:01:13] so don't argue oh he said it is he
[1:01:16] saying this he's saying okay the message
[1:01:18] is broken it's not open the seams are
[1:01:20] not they're there they are broke but not
[1:01:22] the public there
[1:01:24] like he said do you believe me to be god
[1:01:26] is prophet i mean god is servant he was
[1:01:29] addressing to people
[1:01:31] he's saying that many times
[1:01:33] do you believe me to be god is prophet
[1:01:36] or i mean body servant because others
[1:01:38] we're not going to receive him as god is
[1:01:40] perfect others will receive him as god
[1:01:42] is servant they are comfortable with
[1:01:44] that amen when you say you're a servant
[1:01:47] it's okay brother
[1:01:48] but if you were to say a prophet thank
[1:01:50] you for correcting and correcting
[1:01:52] yourself but
[1:01:53] he was not correcting himself
[1:01:56] he was addressing
[1:01:58] different categories of people
[1:02:05] it just depends on who you are it
[1:02:08] depends on what they have put in you
[1:02:10] what a receptor
[1:02:14] it's just like we have the same size of
[1:02:16] memory card but it doesn't hold the same
[1:02:19] data
[1:02:20] this one is one one gb another one is
[1:02:23] 100 gb another one is 62 gb
[1:02:27] so if we put in 128 gb and then another
[1:02:31] one has got just 5 gb
[1:02:34] so when the data is too much
[1:02:44] i can't believe that
[1:02:47] that is beyond me
[1:02:49] and you can't blame the man
[1:02:52] he can only handle 1gb
[1:02:57] for you you are designed
[1:02:59] you may look like you have a very small
[1:03:02] you know memory card but it's having 128
[1:03:06] gb this one has one gb
[1:03:09] and
[1:03:11] you went to the same shop
[1:03:18] so you can receive much more much deeper
[1:03:22] this one receives but little
[1:03:25] what makes common sense not revelation
[1:03:28] deep things brother don't take me into
[1:03:30] that
[1:03:32] i don't blame you
[1:03:36] i only pray for you
[1:03:40] because you can't help it
[1:03:42] but i mean you can buy by faith and the
[1:03:44] bible says you buy and don't sell
[1:03:48] [Laughter]
[1:03:50] glory be to god
[1:03:54] you know there is what they call a pdf
[1:03:56] isn't it
[1:03:57] you have you have a message it has come
[1:03:59] to any box
[1:04:01] but you don't have the pdf reader
[1:04:05] so if you don't have a pdf free reader
[1:04:07] you are not going to receive the message
[1:04:09] that's you are not going to understand
[1:04:11] it you are only going to have it in your
[1:04:13] inbox
[1:04:17] but without a pdf reader
[1:04:20] to open the file
[1:04:22] you are going to remain message you
[1:04:24] received but which message
[1:04:26] what is in the message
[1:04:30] what's in the message you don't know it
[1:04:33] that you have received it okay i have
[1:04:35] received the message i believe the
[1:04:36] message that's the problem that's where
[1:04:38] the difference is
[1:04:43] so
[1:04:44] let's use intellectual intellectualism
[1:04:48] by the way god intestinally uses a
[1:04:51] seventh grade preacher
[1:04:54] with very poor english
[1:05:00] and
[1:05:01] this age we are having sophisticated
[1:05:05] well-educated
[1:05:07] preachers
[1:05:11] i emphasize with you people who are very
[1:05:12] educated
[1:05:14] i'm not it's not a crime god bless you
[1:05:17] but
[1:05:19] don't try to bring that
[1:05:24] in this
[1:05:28] you are going to knock out your brains
[1:05:36] let's use intellectual reasoning against
[1:05:39] the message use some scientific recites
[1:05:42] some methods of silencing this message
[1:05:45] so that we make sure the people are you
[1:05:47] know
[1:05:48] our team is armed with sufficient
[1:05:50] informational data that will silence
[1:05:53] those who try to rise up those priests
[1:05:55] who are unceasing
[1:05:58] in the world
[1:06:01] try to bang them down try to draw them
[1:06:05] into
[1:06:05] arenas of discussion
[1:06:08] and argument
[1:06:12] just come on let's talk take it over
[1:06:19] and that's where the devil invited eve
[1:06:21] you know come to my arena of discussion
[1:06:27] and i will show you something that adam
[1:06:29] your pastor has never showed you
[1:06:34] i give you an alternative view
[1:06:37] [Music]
[1:06:38] i'm not going to dictate anything i'm
[1:06:40] just giving you just for your
[1:06:42] information
[1:06:44] i know you're a brilliant guy
[1:06:48] i know
[1:06:49] you can handle this
[1:06:51] you are not a dummy
[1:06:56] i i know that you are able to challenge
[1:06:58] me if i'm wrong i will accept if you are
[1:07:01] wrong you accept let's just have a
[1:07:03] discussion arena somewhere
[1:07:05] away
[1:07:09] and you go to those websites that are
[1:07:11] forbidden
[1:07:14] huh
[1:07:16] and then the others were why i left the
[1:07:18] message why i left william ranam you
[1:07:20] left william branham
[1:07:23] thank you so much for leaving him you
[1:07:24] were wrong
[1:07:26] [Applause]
[1:07:30] so you were with me and me i was with
[1:07:32] jesus i'm still with jesus
[1:07:34] [Applause]
[1:07:38] why i left the message
[1:07:40] so you just heard the message me i am
[1:07:42] the message so we are two different
[1:07:45] people
[1:07:48] i am the message manifested so i can't
[1:07:50] leave the message and i have no time to
[1:07:53] talk with those who have left the
[1:07:54] message because i can't leave the
[1:07:57] message i am the message
[1:07:59] so you are right brother continue
[1:08:06] me i am the message
[1:08:08] behold i send you
[1:08:12] elijah
[1:08:14] so the package was mine
[1:08:17] so elijah was a servant to bring me
[1:08:22] the message it wasn't his
[1:08:26] liver leave william branham aside
[1:08:29] that man is he's innocent
[1:08:31] that that guy that is thing of god is
[1:08:34] innocent leave god his thing aside
[1:08:39] there afford that holy thing that shall
[1:08:42] be born of thee shall be called a son of
[1:08:45] god
[1:08:46] so it was a thing being used of god to
[1:08:49] redeem you and me
[1:08:53] he's innocent do you know that he wanted
[1:08:55] also to smoke when he was challenged by
[1:08:58] a woman
[1:09:00] he couldn't he was a prisoner but he
[1:09:03] wanted to smoke
[1:09:05] and then whoosh
[1:09:06] [Music]
[1:09:10] he couldn't do what he wanted to do even
[1:09:13] he couldn't he wanted to take a whisk he
[1:09:16] couldn't drink
[1:09:17] he was a prisoner he wanted to break the
[1:09:20] word he couldn't break it and god said
[1:09:23] why because there is a work for you to
[1:09:26] do
[1:09:27] when you shall be older and the worker
[1:09:30] was to receive
[1:09:32] the message for me
[1:09:35] so i am standing here today in the
[1:09:37] defense of william branham leave that
[1:09:39] man alone
[1:09:41] let him rest in peace he has done his
[1:09:43] work
[1:09:45] he has gone
[1:09:46] stop talking about him
[1:09:49] let's talk about jesus
[1:09:53] he's here
[1:09:55] talk about the bribe
[1:09:57] talk about him what manifested talk
[1:10:00] about rupture talk about going home talk
[1:10:03] about new jerusalem talk about millennia
[1:10:07] talk about the bride ministry
[1:10:10] it's because there are a bunch of
[1:10:12] failures
[1:10:13] [Applause]
[1:10:17] but there are some people who are going
[1:10:18] home they are going right home they are
[1:10:21] moving on their movies on for the bride
[1:10:24] [Applause]
[1:10:28] so
[1:10:31] stuck at the office
[1:10:33] devising devices
[1:10:40] and there are a lot of websites
[1:10:44] why do you go there just the heading
[1:10:47] alone should tell you this is the danger
[1:10:48] zone
[1:10:50] this uh this is a wicked device
[1:10:54] devised against me
[1:10:57] because i am the message
[1:11:01] devised against me and my groom jesus
[1:11:04] christ because that man whom they are
[1:11:06] talking about the name william branham
[1:11:08] is is just the name of a man a thing
[1:11:11] that god used to bring the message and
[1:11:12] the message was to prepare me for him
[1:11:16] i am not mrs branningham her message
[1:11:18] jesus christ
[1:11:20] [Applause]
[1:11:20] [Music]
[1:11:25] so stop knocking making that useless
[1:11:27] noise
[1:11:29] i don't have time for it
[1:11:35] glory be to god
[1:11:38] so this is what is going on and the
[1:11:41] devil is always the liar you know
[1:11:44] the devil is always a liar but there are
[1:11:46] those who believe the lies of the devil
[1:11:49] you know and then what one thing is they
[1:11:52] are saying
[1:11:53] let us smile him with the tank
[1:11:58] they are very good speaker
[1:12:01] slice
[1:12:03] shrewd
[1:12:07] satell
[1:12:11] all that those were the
[1:12:14] the the characters of the serpent
[1:12:20] and that's what i was preaching about in
[1:12:22] the message is the god is provided
[1:12:24] standard against the mamba at kadesh
[1:12:27] bania there is that member
[1:12:30] popping up in the wind again in the way
[1:12:35] and wants to kill
[1:12:36] but there are those who are going to
[1:12:38] overcome the friends of the prophet
[1:12:41] they are there
[1:12:43] oh glory be to god
[1:12:46] now here is smite with the tank that's
[1:12:49] first step
[1:12:53] second step
[1:12:55] do not give heed
[1:12:58] to any
[1:12:59] of his works
[1:13:04] it's a disease
[1:13:06] that
[1:13:07] you know
[1:13:08] disarms
[1:13:10] people from leaving out
[1:13:13] what they know
[1:13:14] what they believe
[1:13:17] what god called them to come to
[1:13:20] you know this is the truth but i mean
[1:13:23] like you look at your wife you know i'm
[1:13:24] supposed to love her i'm the only
[1:13:26] husband she has but you don't even love
[1:13:28] her you look at your husband
[1:13:31] he's the bible paul who was not even
[1:13:34] married i was asking the church one time
[1:13:35] why should a man who is not married tell
[1:13:38] you
[1:13:39] wives
[1:13:40] love your own husbands
[1:13:44] husbands love your wife i mean who will
[1:13:47] love your wife for you
[1:13:53] who do you want to have your wife with
[1:13:59] glory be to god
[1:14:01] things that you know
[1:14:03] smile
[1:14:05] cherish encourage
[1:14:08] tell her the best words needs to hear
[1:14:10] tell her she's beautiful why should
[1:14:12] another man tell your wife you look cute
[1:14:15] you look beautiful and you are there
[1:14:17] from january to december you just say
[1:14:19] dumb
[1:14:21] until when another man tells her it's
[1:14:23] like he's hearing tanks
[1:14:27] so i am beautiful
[1:14:35] oh you pay your tithes i mean who will
[1:14:37] tell you to pay your time
[1:14:40] what don't you know
[1:14:42] you know it
[1:14:48] rejoice at the word you come here in the
[1:14:50] church and you're seated like a brick
[1:14:55] what will make you happy if jesus
[1:14:57] doesn't make you happy
[1:15:00] whom will you receive again
[1:15:02] who is better than jesus
[1:15:05] what makes you happy
[1:15:11] while others are frowning at him who
[1:15:13] should rejoice at him we should receive
[1:15:15] him who should praise him who should
[1:15:17] worship him
[1:15:21] this is a time to rejoice
[1:15:24] it's our time to be happy we are in
[1:15:26] heavenly places and you are talking
[1:15:28] about rapture do you know what rapture
[1:15:31] means extreme joy
[1:15:33] you are not going to go in the rapture
[1:15:35] when you are silent and sad and
[1:15:41] [Applause]
[1:15:44] rejoice until the devil gets confused
[1:15:47] you have a pain you are happy you are
[1:15:49] sick you are happy you have problems
[1:15:51] here you are happy
[1:15:52] and the devil is confused what do i do
[1:15:55] to make this man sad
[1:15:57] because you are in the rupture you are
[1:15:59] in the process you are going home
[1:16:02] the devil wants you to be gloomy
[1:16:11] who will tell you to rejoice to be happy
[1:16:13] i mean who is here you come to meet whom
[1:16:16] you come to me to jesus jesus is here
[1:16:18] jesus is your husband
[1:16:21] which which man doesn't want a wife who
[1:16:23] smiles for him
[1:16:25] [Applause]
[1:16:28] and you say you are the wife of jesus
[1:16:30] and you can't smile at the word you
[1:16:32] can't rejoice at the word you are not
[1:16:34] free you are bound you are bogged down
[1:16:37] you are held
[1:16:38] you don't exercise you are reported
[1:16:41] something is wrong
[1:16:46] we are the people
[1:16:50] we are the subject of the devil the
[1:16:52] devil is talking about us that's why
[1:16:54] he's fighting the word
[1:16:56] you are the reason
[1:16:58] you are the reason the devil is still
[1:17:00] upset you are the idea the reason there
[1:17:02] is a lot of devices going on and and
[1:17:05] moves and talks and and and and plans
[1:17:09] because you are here so you should thank
[1:17:12] god that you are still positive with the
[1:17:14] world
[1:17:18] glory be to god
[1:17:19] i wish i was a better preacher
[1:17:22] [Applause]
[1:17:25] let us not keep heed
[1:17:27] and you come to church and you are there
[1:17:30] sleeping dozy
[1:17:32] and you are not pre you think you are
[1:17:34] not helping the devil to fulfill the
[1:17:36] scheme number two
[1:17:40] [Music]
[1:17:42] come go to church but don't give heed
[1:17:50] and the devil will you know you know pat
[1:17:52] your back and you know like you know i
[1:17:55] know some of you know how hogs are pigs
[1:17:58] you know
[1:18:00] they love being wrapped and especially
[1:18:02] when they have some you know
[1:18:04] and then
[1:18:10] and the devil comes and rubs your back
[1:18:12] and makes you so comfortable saying now
[1:18:14] you can sleep sleep please
[1:18:17] please
[1:18:18] i beg you sleep a bit
[1:18:21] i don't want you to listen to this sleep
[1:18:24] and you go back home in the night there
[1:18:25] is no sleep
[1:18:31] there's no sleep
[1:18:33] scheme
[1:18:35] smite the message smite the prophet
[1:18:37] smite the office with the tongue
[1:18:40] [Music]
[1:18:42] define him belittle him
[1:18:44] just like brother branham in the message
[1:18:47] taking sides with jesus
[1:18:49] he underlines the underscores the fact
[1:18:51] that if sanhedrin was always bent on one
[1:18:55] thing to belittle jesus
[1:19:00] to make him non-relevant irrelevant
[1:19:04] yet they knew he was much much much more
[1:19:08] powerful
[1:19:10] than all their seven denominations put
[1:19:12] together in the sanhedrin
[1:19:16] he was giving them sleepless nights they
[1:19:20] had to explain why this man is
[1:19:22] performing all these miracles and they
[1:19:24] don't have it in their system
[1:19:29] so they it's just
[1:19:31] the elves of that
[1:19:34] that is easier said isn't it very easy
[1:19:38] but it was a statement of envy
[1:19:43] do not give heed to his words after
[1:19:46] smiting him with a tank
[1:19:52] makes you like you are accustomed you
[1:19:54] are used
[1:19:55] to the message you know the message
[1:20:00] you know it
[1:20:02] let me tell you
[1:20:04] every time you come to church you hear
[1:20:07] something new
[1:20:08] every time i read this bible i i begin
[1:20:11] to realize i don't know it
[1:20:16] he just keeps revealing himself
[1:20:19] every other time
[1:20:21] he becomes sweeter
[1:20:26] blessed should be the name of the lord
[1:20:28] let us not give
[1:20:30] heed to any
[1:20:33] of his words
[1:20:36] and jeremiah is saying lord now that i
[1:20:38] am rejected
[1:20:41] and that is my subject
[1:20:43] the subject is
[1:20:45] god
[1:20:46] giving heed to the voice of him that is
[1:20:50] rejected
[1:20:56] and you will be the most happy person in
[1:20:59] this world if you are rejected because
[1:21:01] of the word
[1:21:05] if you are maligned defined abused
[1:21:10] segregated
[1:21:12] because of the word
[1:21:17] you think it was easy for brother
[1:21:18] branham to stand one man against the
[1:21:20] whole world against the denominations
[1:21:22] what pressure
[1:21:24] all the friends and
[1:21:26] he you can feel him
[1:21:28] his heart when he was speaking standing
[1:21:30] in the gap and he says letters are
[1:21:32] coming in every day i used to have all
[1:21:35] the confidence in your ministry i no
[1:21:37] longer have it
[1:21:39] when you say this you're saying it this
[1:21:41] you attacked this you preached this we
[1:21:43] have withdrawn we walked out of your
[1:21:45] service and we went home letters coming
[1:21:48] from friends
[1:21:51] you think
[1:21:52] it is not pain
[1:21:54] it depends
[1:21:57] you think we we we want to preach it in
[1:22:00] the way that people are hot
[1:22:02] or we enjoy when people leave the church
[1:22:06] who would enjoy that
[1:22:10] you don't know the pain
[1:22:12] like brother abraham says i would rather
[1:22:14] get skinny than you want to offend even
[1:22:17] one of you
[1:22:18] but he says i can't help it
[1:22:22] like i said earlier he was a victim
[1:22:30] that's good
[1:22:31] something what the prophet says here
[1:22:34] you know
[1:22:35] these are things that i want you to
[1:22:36] underline one
[1:22:38] the reason the devil is rising the storm
[1:22:41] raising the storm is because the law has
[1:22:43] failed to perish the word has failed it
[1:22:46] has prevailed
[1:22:49] this is what the devil didn't expect
[1:22:56] some of you people have gone through
[1:22:57] this experiences some of you are
[1:22:59] survivors
[1:23:00] of terrible episodes
[1:23:04] survivors of ministers who have left the
[1:23:06] message
[1:23:08] and they never expected you to die with
[1:23:10] that
[1:23:12] but you have survived by god's grace you
[1:23:15] have strived of you you are moving on
[1:23:17] and the devil said what do i do
[1:23:22] this guy is still there
[1:23:26] that woman is still adamant
[1:23:29] oh
[1:23:34] it has failed to perish from their
[1:23:36] hearts
[1:23:37] the world is still there
[1:23:39] they're still holding on
[1:23:41] and friends when coffee they came i
[1:23:43] didn't know how to come back here but
[1:23:45] i've come here to say press on hold on
[1:23:49] if we don't meet again
[1:23:50] let's
[1:23:52] let's hold on let's press on
[1:23:55] i have nothing else
[1:23:59] and i can tell you
[1:24:03] let this word not fail
[1:24:06] from your heart
[1:24:12] and the act the counsel from the wise is
[1:24:14] unceasing they have to you know they
[1:24:17] want to mask him off
[1:24:19] from those who want to listen to those
[1:24:21] who have weak words of wisdom
[1:24:23] encouragement ministries that can
[1:24:24] encourage that can edify
[1:24:26] and embolden the bride
[1:24:28] they want to silence those voices
[1:24:31] and that's why
[1:24:32] the devil when he fights you he even
[1:24:35] doesn't want you to have a friend
[1:24:39] one brother was telling me
[1:24:42] brother abraham i said yes
[1:24:45] you are the
[1:24:46] why are you a friend of brother church
[1:24:50] and he called me from the u.s here
[1:24:53] i said
[1:24:55] why are you also not a friend of chad
[1:25:02] and why are you asking me
[1:25:05] oh brother abraham with your ministry
[1:25:08] why do you attach yourself to a man like
[1:25:10] that
[1:25:12] i said which ministry
[1:25:15] which ministry do i have
[1:25:18] it's the minister of jesus christ
[1:25:20] and jesus christ is in him jesus christ
[1:25:23] is in you he's in you he's in you in
[1:25:25] everybody so which ministry do i have
[1:25:29] and then there are those who are saying
[1:25:30] we blame brother chad for highlighting
[1:25:33] mahira
[1:25:34] so who is highlighting you who is
[1:25:36] supporting who
[1:25:38] we can't help it
[1:25:40] we are just attributes of god who can't
[1:25:43] help coming together
[1:25:44] it's the fellowship of the attributes
[1:25:47] and it's automatic you are not going to
[1:25:49] stop it
[1:25:56] so they want to fight you
[1:25:58] but they don't even want you to have a
[1:26:00] friend
[1:26:01] and yet for them they have friends
[1:26:05] why do you have friends and you don't
[1:26:06] want me to have a friend
[1:26:10] you have those people you are saying
[1:26:11] come
[1:26:14] there is a company that is a come
[1:26:17] let us devise
[1:26:19] why should we do so i have a brother so
[1:26:20] that i said brother chad come
[1:26:23] let us stand with the word let us press
[1:26:25] on let's move forward
[1:26:29] god bless you brother chester there must
[1:26:31] be a friend
[1:26:33] i said brother chester don't give up
[1:26:35] stan stand for the word fight on
[1:26:39] i can know from uganda that i have
[1:26:41] rather done rightly faster friend
[1:26:43] i have brother chad i have i mean why
[1:26:46] not
[1:26:48] jesus paid for it and and who are you to
[1:26:50] ask me about it
[1:26:54] i heard from heaven
[1:26:57] and i'm comfortable by the anointing of
[1:26:59] the spirit from heaven that that is a
[1:27:01] real genuine brother so who are you to
[1:27:04] tell me negatives about him
[1:27:10] so who is propping up who
[1:27:12] how would have known each other he
[1:27:14] wouldn't have known me if jesus had not
[1:27:16] called me
[1:27:22] blessed be the remark of the lord
[1:27:24] so they want to silence any counsel
[1:27:28] anybody that would be of
[1:27:31] edification to you
[1:27:33] who could support you
[1:27:35] who could speak a word that encourages
[1:27:39] you they want to cut you off from any
[1:27:42] brother that has a gift that has a
[1:27:44] ministry and
[1:27:46] a brother to isolate you
[1:27:49] like the political world using sanctions
[1:28:05] blessed be the name of the world
[1:28:09] these are the demons we are dealing with
[1:28:12] and they are very active
[1:28:19] i mean when i come here to preach i
[1:28:20] don't preach for brother chad
[1:28:26] we are just servants
[1:28:29] i i i nicknamed him a bowl-headed
[1:28:36] about anyone
[1:28:40] robin
[1:28:48] from africa it's a ball anyone bought
[1:28:51] the headed one
[1:28:52] so if i bring you someone sandy witches
[1:28:55] no problem
[1:28:59] you don't have to ask whether my beak is
[1:29:01] sanitized or not
[1:29:05] as long as the world is coming
[1:29:09] glory be to god
[1:29:11] so the word from the prophet the
[1:29:13] prophetic message he is proving that
[1:29:16] it's unstoppable the fountain is
[1:29:18] inexhaustible so look for the purported
[1:29:21] force with the ring and the neck
[1:29:23] negatively expose it to the public as
[1:29:26] any fit
[1:29:29] so give me something that is more fit
[1:29:31] than the message
[1:29:35] show me a ministry that is more
[1:29:37] vindicated than that of malachi 4.
[1:29:40] give me
[1:29:41] even a quote of that vindication bring
[1:29:43] it
[1:29:45] bring it
[1:29:49] a bunch of honeycombed so-called great
[1:29:53] men
[1:29:54] having nothing
[1:29:57] empty
[1:29:58] how dare you
[1:30:05] i am more than convinced too late
[1:30:11] i'm gone i'm taken
[1:30:14] try elsewhere
[1:30:18] oh
[1:30:19] glory be to god
[1:30:21] let's look at something here you know
[1:30:23] the prophet comes here in his quote
[1:30:26] he says
[1:30:28] i think it's in the message
[1:30:30] um
[1:30:30] [Music]
[1:30:31] identified the identified christ of all
[1:30:34] ages which he preaches i think in 1964
[1:30:36] he says what is it
[1:30:38] when a man breaks through
[1:30:40] that veil
[1:30:43] into the shekinah glory now
[1:30:46] not then now
[1:30:49] the world calls him a fanatic
[1:30:53] oh are you ready to be called a fanatic
[1:30:56] if you are not ready don't break through
[1:31:02] you want a name you have a name to
[1:31:04] protect
[1:31:06] you want to be defined
[1:31:08] by the nobility the noble you know among
[1:31:11] the nobles of the world
[1:31:13] to have a test
[1:31:15] among a society
[1:31:18] so you are highly esteemed
[1:31:20] a man of a woman of renown
[1:31:24] among the economies of society
[1:31:27] okay
[1:31:29] your heart you don't have to break into
[1:31:32] but if you break into
[1:31:34] this kind of glory now the world will
[1:31:37] call you a what fanatic
[1:31:42] they can't see what's wrong
[1:31:45] but behind there there is no beauty of
[1:31:48] him
[1:31:50] you lose your beauty when you go there
[1:31:55] and he says he might not pronounce his
[1:31:57] words right and that's what the prophet
[1:31:59] was
[1:32:00] he might not dress just right that's
[1:32:03] what john the baptist was in a scheme
[1:32:10] he might not dress
[1:32:12] any cloudy clothes
[1:32:18] she might not rest the way they think
[1:32:19] she owe to now he brings in the sisters
[1:32:22] also
[1:32:24] it may be but
[1:32:26] you see inside behind that by your skin
[1:32:30] behind that human
[1:32:32] skin
[1:32:33] in there is the shekinah glory in there
[1:32:35] is the power in there is the word in
[1:32:38] there is the shoe braid and the shaking
[1:32:40] of glory which is the light that makes
[1:32:43] that
[1:32:43] that that makes that makes like that
[1:32:46] ripe ripens the grain
[1:32:49] he continues here he says
[1:32:51] and until you come in behind that barge
[1:32:54] skin until you get out of your old skin
[1:32:59] old
[1:33:01] nature character
[1:33:06] your comfort zone where you are living
[1:33:09] in a level of acceptance
[1:33:12] in the realm of
[1:33:14] positive perception
[1:33:20] then you come out of your own skin your
[1:33:23] holy thoughts
[1:33:25] let this mind be in you
[1:33:27] that was also in christ jesus you see
[1:33:30] you are all the thoughts you leave them
[1:33:31] you are all cribs
[1:33:34] all the cribs and you come into the
[1:33:36] princess of god
[1:33:40] then the word becomes a living reality
[1:33:42] to you living reality not some dead
[1:33:46] all the acarion that you keep belching
[1:33:49] some funny smell
[1:33:58] the word becomes a living reality then
[1:34:00] you are awakened to the kind of glory
[1:34:03] now listen then the bible becomes a new
[1:34:07] book
[1:34:10] then jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:34:12] today and forever when the bible becomes
[1:34:15] a new book jesus becomes the sin
[1:34:19] now when the bible becomes a new book
[1:34:21] you preach new sermons new understanding
[1:34:25] new life
[1:34:26] everything becomes new and the people
[1:34:29] don't want the bible to become a new
[1:34:32] book they want to preach from the holy
[1:34:34] bible that is still sealed
[1:34:37] only
[1:34:39] way of presenting the message
[1:34:46] don't don't take me out of my comfort
[1:34:48] zone
[1:34:49] don't talk about these things brother
[1:34:51] don't
[1:34:54] brabram says the bible became a new book
[1:34:56] for him
[1:34:58] when the seals were opened the bible
[1:35:00] became a new book
[1:35:02] and when jesus came you know the bible
[1:35:05] became a new book
[1:35:07] that's why he broke the sabbath
[1:35:10] the rest day to bring rest
[1:35:19] he broke the rest
[1:35:20] to the body to bring rest to the soul
[1:35:23] which also eventually became rest to the
[1:35:26] flesh
[1:35:27] because he told a man who has been bound
[1:35:30] sick fought eight years and said rise up
[1:35:32] take your bed walk go home on the
[1:35:35] sabbath day and then he's freed even
[1:35:38] physically
[1:35:40] but the other sabbath other rests you
[1:35:43] will come and go and it was not resting
[1:35:45] here comes the real sabbath
[1:35:48] on the suburb
[1:35:51] and the new sabbath breaks the old
[1:35:53] sabbath
[1:35:55] and gives you the sabbath
[1:36:00] glory be to god and that's where the
[1:36:02] problem that in the ministry of jesus
[1:36:05] they had a problem with jesus let's go
[1:36:07] quickly here in the book of luke
[1:36:10] i just want to finish quickly
[1:36:15] i'm not even knowing the time here now
[1:36:22] luke chapter 13.
[1:36:24] verse 31
[1:36:30] and the same day there came certain of
[1:36:33] the pharisees saying unto him get thee
[1:36:36] out and the path hence for herod will
[1:36:39] kill you
[1:36:44] this is exactly what they told amus
[1:36:48] get out of here
[1:36:50] the king is going to deal with you if
[1:36:52] you stay here
[1:36:58] they tell jesus get out from here go
[1:37:00] away herod will kill you
[1:37:05] and jesus is saying unto them go in and
[1:37:09] tell that fox
[1:37:17] and you know a fox
[1:37:19] will always hold when it has closed the
[1:37:21] eyes in the dark
[1:37:31] blind holders
[1:37:34] making a lot of noise that they cannot
[1:37:37] batteries
[1:37:38] with anything real
[1:37:43] we are not a bunch of holders
[1:37:46] holding making noise for nothing
[1:37:51] when i say hallelujah it has substance
[1:37:55] when i say praise god i i feel it from
[1:37:59] deep enemy
[1:38:02] when i sing a song it has substance
[1:38:07] go and tell that
[1:38:09] those bunch of empty holy
[1:38:12] beasts
[1:38:17] they are making a lot of noise for
[1:38:18] nothing
[1:38:19] blinded
[1:38:23] go and tell him
[1:38:25] behold i cast out devils
[1:38:28] i do chores today and tomorrow and the
[1:38:31] third day i shall be perfected this was
[1:38:34] prophetic
[1:38:35] because today is the third day
[1:38:45] perfected
[1:38:48] but they were saying leave this place
[1:38:49] don't prophesy here don't perform your
[1:38:51] miracles yeah we don't want you here
[1:38:58] and
[1:38:59] you'll find that jesus
[1:39:02] they always faulted him the problem with
[1:39:05] the sanhedrin was that
[1:39:07] and a general jewish populace was that
[1:39:10] he was breaking the gnomes and the
[1:39:11] traditional way of doing things breaking
[1:39:14] the sub-path
[1:39:17] i think that's what they always tell me
[1:39:20] one brother one brother told him brother
[1:39:22] brother maher i have one problem with
[1:39:24] you i said so you are not preaching the
[1:39:28] orthodox
[1:39:29] generally
[1:39:30] accepted way
[1:39:33] i said can you give me a book on how to
[1:39:35] preach
[1:39:39] so you people have got some syllabus
[1:39:44] that preachers should follow
[1:39:49] this is like you know they wanted to arm
[1:39:51] david
[1:39:52] with some kind of special um
[1:39:55] and everybody says i'll go in the way
[1:39:56] that i know
[1:40:00] as long as it works
[1:40:02] take take however you want you are new
[1:40:04] ideas
[1:40:08] i'll go the way i know god called me to
[1:40:10] do it
[1:40:13] if you can only punish it brother and
[1:40:14] bring it this and what did this but you
[1:40:16] people you had in this armor and goliath
[1:40:18] is here
[1:40:21] 39 days you you are going backwards
[1:40:25] and now you are trying to tell me i must
[1:40:27] put on your armor
[1:40:29] what have you done with your armor
[1:40:32] [Applause]
[1:40:32] [Music]
[1:40:34] well this is the way we do it brother
[1:40:36] this is the way we don't go the sides we
[1:40:39] always preach it like this and we cover
[1:40:41] it like you know
[1:40:43] some little mother
[1:40:45] mother hen trying to tell the chicks
[1:40:48] cluck crack crack this is the way we eat
[1:40:50] this is the thing don't go this way just
[1:40:52] with scratch scratch here be done and
[1:40:54] you just follow my data feet and eat
[1:40:57] no
[1:41:01] go the way god called you we are not the
[1:41:03] same
[1:41:07] i told him brother
[1:41:08] if i preached the way he wanted me to
[1:41:10] preach
[1:41:12] you know
[1:41:13] the results
[1:41:14] that is a brotherhood come all the way
[1:41:16] to see me and he's telling me brother
[1:41:18] god is using you but you have to change
[1:41:21] your way of approach and preaching
[1:41:23] things like this if you can just adjust
[1:41:25] here and i said brother if i had
[1:41:27] adjusted you would not have seen the
[1:41:30] supernatural that you have come to ask
[1:41:32] me about it
[1:41:37] that's what i am
[1:41:39] correct me if i'm wrong
[1:41:42] by the word
[1:41:45] not by some kind of ecclesiastical idea
[1:41:55] so that's what is what is the problem he
[1:41:58] broke on the sabbath and introduced the
[1:42:00] sabbath
[1:42:01] and brought sabbath to the man who was
[1:42:03] in trouble but he broke the sabbath to
[1:42:05] bring the sabbath on the sabbath day
[1:42:07] okay
[1:42:12] so brother abraham also became you and
[1:42:14] everybody was saying no no no no no we
[1:42:16] cannot receive you now it's finished
[1:42:18] it's kaput fine leave me alone and the
[1:42:20] brother says as long as god stood with
[1:42:23] me all men have forsaken me that he
[1:42:26] remained with me
[1:42:28] [Applause]
[1:42:30] more comfortable isn't it
[1:42:32] i'm more comfortable when he remains
[1:42:37] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:42:40] so i want to just come to this
[1:42:46] let me leave some of the things here
[1:42:49] this the pharisees always wanted to
[1:42:52] intimidate
[1:42:56] but
[1:42:58] he was more than a match
[1:43:01] for them he was god
[1:43:06] and i i sometimes wonder people can get
[1:43:10] so blinded as to think that this message
[1:43:12] can be silenced
[1:43:17] this message is good
[1:43:22] why are you a mere creature
[1:43:28] and you think you can silence this
[1:43:32] the prophet said as long as there is
[1:43:35] even one man
[1:43:36] surrendered total in the hands of god he
[1:43:39] is the majority
[1:43:41] you are not going to stop that man
[1:43:49] so we continue a little bit here
[1:43:52] but i want to come something here
[1:43:55] and and i want us to go back and examine
[1:43:58] these statements
[1:44:01] with
[1:44:02] they are telling amos
[1:44:05] a messiah the priest
[1:44:07] a seasoned preacher
[1:44:09] a contemporary
[1:44:12] of the prophet
[1:44:15] i know him
[1:44:17] in and out
[1:44:21] and it's the one
[1:44:23] telling him
[1:44:25] get out of bethel
[1:44:27] what does bethel means the house of god
[1:44:34] you are chasing the prophet of god from
[1:44:38] the house of god
[1:44:42] and you know what he says this is no
[1:44:44] longer a house of god although it's
[1:44:46] called the house of god but is the
[1:44:49] king's
[1:44:50] chapel
[1:44:53] private prayer business
[1:45:07] that's what they are telling amos where
[1:45:08] are we ready now
[1:45:10] chapter 7
[1:45:13] is
[1:45:14] saying you see are you prophet
[1:45:18] free
[1:45:19] go into the land of judah
[1:45:22] there you eat bread and prophesy there
[1:45:26] but don't prophesy again
[1:45:29] better for it is the king is chapel and
[1:45:32] it's the king is caught
[1:45:37] something sounds something familiar in
[1:45:39] the new testament here let's open our
[1:45:42] bibles and compare this with first
[1:45:44] corinthians
[1:45:59] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:46:01] first corinthians chapter four
[1:46:05] and let's look at i think
[1:46:07] verse seven
[1:46:14] for who maketh thee to differ from
[1:46:16] another
[1:46:20] and what has thou
[1:46:22] that thou did not receive
[1:46:32] whatever you have
[1:46:34] you just received amen
[1:46:41] if they are bright if you are
[1:46:42] intelligent if you are beautiful who
[1:46:44] made you beautiful
[1:46:48] so you think you applied and god gave
[1:46:51] god some favor to make you beautiful and
[1:46:53] charming
[1:46:57] oh
[1:46:59] if you're beautiful who made you
[1:47:01] beautiful god if you are handsome
[1:47:03] who made you honest of god
[1:47:05] if you're bright
[1:47:07] what you call smart
[1:47:11] how many of you smart
[1:47:14] why is it that in the class there are
[1:47:16] some of those people who fail they try
[1:47:18] they study they fail and for you are
[1:47:20] always passing who made you smart
[1:47:25] what weren't you just given by god
[1:47:33] and if you are a preacher like me
[1:47:37] who may be a preacher
[1:47:43] did you go to any training
[1:47:45] are you are you very intelligent
[1:47:50] is it because you are so special
[1:47:54] god is able to make preachers and
[1:47:56] believers out of stones
[1:48:01] and then the devil has made some people
[1:48:03] to reach a point where they think
[1:48:05] they
[1:48:06] they they they are i mean indispensable
[1:48:13] if i left the message it will crumble
[1:48:16] sure
[1:48:27] brother if i leave you a church that
[1:48:29] church is going to be shaken so are you
[1:48:31] mr earthquake
[1:48:44] maybe i'm not a good speaker you'll
[1:48:46] forgive me but that's what i am
[1:48:49] i don't know how to bring it english is
[1:48:50] not my language
[1:48:54] so i'm not smart i'm not bringing things
[1:48:56] in a smart way i'm very crude
[1:49:00] very raw
[1:49:04] what do you have that you didn't just
[1:49:07] receive
[1:49:11] what do these people think they have
[1:49:13] that they need to receive
[1:49:16] what intelligence what understanding
[1:49:18] what revelation what knowledge what
[1:49:21] wisdom what experience
[1:49:27] and then the devil always wants to
[1:49:28] create a difference he you are not
[1:49:31] comfort if you have a problem you are
[1:49:34] not comfortable being
[1:49:37] in unison in common
[1:49:41] in you know having things in common
[1:49:44] people want always to deviate to be
[1:49:46] special
[1:49:48] to be different
[1:49:54] different even from the prophet from the
[1:49:56] message i think here he was wrong i have
[1:50:00] a better idea the message according to
[1:50:02] brother so and so
[1:50:04] preacher so and so according to my
[1:50:06] understanding
[1:50:11] who gave you that little brain of yours
[1:50:21] who gave you even the breath you are
[1:50:23] using to speak
[1:50:27] just like
[1:50:29] you know danielle told beerus he says
[1:50:31] the very god in whose hands thy breath
[1:50:35] is
[1:50:36] thou has not glorified
[1:50:38] can imagine god who is holding your
[1:50:40] breath in his hands
[1:50:46] if he was just to shake it off you are
[1:50:49] finished
[1:50:52] you are gone kaput
[1:50:55] when is the barrier arrangements
[1:50:58] when are we
[1:51:02] finished
[1:51:08] i was hearing a brother testify i think
[1:51:10] it was brother down and he mentioned
[1:51:12] something i said i i my flesh thing you
[1:51:14] know my skin thing then when he said
[1:51:17] someone said i'm here to correct the
[1:51:19] prophet and in a few times he's gone
[1:51:24] correct the prophet a divine interpreter
[1:51:29] god called god chosen god ordained god
[1:51:32] equipped
[1:51:33] god vindicated
[1:51:34] how dare you
[1:51:37] even if you were the devil himself
[1:51:41] the devil even saluted
[1:51:48] whatever that little
[1:51:50] small man who said the devil would
[1:51:52] respect
[1:51:55] so who are you
[1:52:00] i'm smart i'm not a
[1:52:02] a fool
[1:52:04] sure
[1:52:12] well pasta myra has come with an attack
[1:52:14] on america yes
[1:52:17] we are not americans we are not africans
[1:52:20] we are christians
[1:52:22] and if you are an american you are in
[1:52:24] the wrong place you are you are lost
[1:52:27] you are only american physically
[1:52:30] but not in the spiritual realm
[1:52:35] i have my rights to my mind to my
[1:52:38] thinking to my ideas you have your
[1:52:41] rights devil given
[1:52:46] but not god given
[1:52:48] the church of god is built on revelation
[1:52:51] not rights
[1:52:53] [Applause]
[1:52:56] so the devil wants to make people
[1:52:59] devise devices that make them different
[1:53:02] from the prophetic message
[1:53:07] brother don't be one of them sister
[1:53:09] don't
[1:53:11] so far so good you've made it you are
[1:53:13] here
[1:53:20] let's continue a bit
[1:53:22] he's saying
[1:53:24] we are in the book of corinthians i
[1:53:26] think
[1:53:27] as well wait
[1:53:29] he says
[1:53:32] for who maketh
[1:53:34] thee to differ from another
[1:53:37] so if we made you different it's god who
[1:53:39] made you different
[1:53:41] if he has not made you different don't
[1:53:43] try to be different
[1:53:48] and what has thou what have you got
[1:53:53] that thou did not receive
[1:53:56] now if thou didst receive it
[1:54:00] why does thou glory
[1:54:03] if you just received it
[1:54:06] why are you bragging about it
[1:54:10] as if thou
[1:54:11] has not received it
[1:54:14] as if you made it yourself
[1:54:17] you even don't know how you came
[1:54:19] you don't know how you are behaving in
[1:54:20] your mother's womb
[1:54:28] let me come to this final point
[1:54:30] verse 8 now listen to verse 8
[1:54:33] now you are full
[1:54:39] now you are rich
[1:54:43] and you have reigned as kings
[1:54:47] without us
[1:54:48] who was the one speaking this is paul
[1:54:51] paul the messenger to the ephesians and
[1:54:54] he's saying because i'm out of place
[1:54:57] i'm not there
[1:54:59] you are full
[1:55:01] you are rich
[1:55:02] you have reigned as kings
[1:55:05] you've taken over the temple the house
[1:55:08] of god to become chapels
[1:55:13] this is the king's chapel it's no longer
[1:55:16] bethel
[1:55:20] this is my church
[1:55:23] don't preach that stuff here i don't
[1:55:26] want that
[1:55:27] don't believe in the cities being open
[1:55:29] don't believe in this don't believe this
[1:55:31] i don't believe this i don't want this
[1:55:33] here
[1:55:36] who is speaking
[1:55:38] a king he has a chapel
[1:55:48] chasing away the message chasing away
[1:55:51] the prophet we don't want you here this
[1:55:54] is no longer bethel this is now the king
[1:55:57] is chapel
[1:56:00] we are reigning as kings
[1:56:02] we used to subscribe fully to the
[1:56:04] message when we were still young purpose
[1:56:08] and and anchored but now i'm established
[1:56:10] i know
[1:56:12] am i sure enough
[1:56:14] don't worry prophet back to the bible
[1:56:17] hallelujah
[1:56:19] back to the bible
[1:56:22] can you show me a bible without a
[1:56:24] prophet
[1:56:28] back to the bible a fool
[1:56:33] you read the book of jeremiah a prophet
[1:56:35] isaiah a prophet
[1:56:37] daniel a prophet ezekiel a prophet
[1:56:41] so show me a bible without a prophet
[1:56:43] i read genesis prophet jenny is exodus
[1:56:47] prophet
[1:56:48] leviticus numbers deuteronomy a prophet
[1:56:51] moses
[1:56:54] i mean
[1:56:55] judges i mean tell me anyway first
[1:56:57] somewhere prophet second so which bible
[1:57:01] is without a prophet
[1:57:04] back the bible
[1:57:06] back to the bible
[1:57:12] that's a statement of a deceived fellow
[1:57:17] and i'm not scared to say that
[1:57:20] because you heard this bible in your
[1:57:22] hands and you didn't even know baptism
[1:57:24] in jesus name
[1:57:30] you were still baptized dedicated to the
[1:57:33] pagan gods of rome
[1:57:35] trinity
[1:57:36] god the father that zeus got their son
[1:57:39] bow
[1:57:41] given new names
[1:57:45] dedicated to the three deities of pagan
[1:57:47] rome in the name of christianity
[1:57:51] you were still a pagan wrong believer
[1:57:54] under guys
[1:57:55] until the message came
[1:57:57] [Applause]
[1:58:02] and then you want to throw away the
[1:58:04] message and say i'm back to the bible
[1:58:07] when did the message take you away from
[1:58:09] the bible
[1:58:15] so you can see the tactics of the enemy
[1:58:20] confusing the vulnerable
[1:58:26] and that's why they are concentrating on
[1:58:28] the office of the prophet they don't
[1:58:30] want to go beyond
[1:58:33] that office
[1:58:35] because once we succeed in demonizing
[1:58:38] weakening and you know belittling and
[1:58:41] silencing that off office then the
[1:58:44] purpose
[1:58:45] of god for this age is finished the
[1:58:47] devil knows how important that office is
[1:58:50] he never knows it but the problem is the
[1:58:53] office is already done its work
[1:58:57] so you are fighting a shadow
[1:59:02] the man is resting he's gone
[1:59:05] he's waiting for me
[1:59:07] [Applause]
[1:59:10] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:59:14] so we have this problem and then he says
[1:59:16] it's i mean it's very evident that the
[1:59:19] absence of the messenger paul
[1:59:22] made the corinthian pastors
[1:59:25] kings
[1:59:28] and paul is saying now you have reigned
[1:59:30] as kings
[1:59:32] now you are full
[1:59:34] now you are rich
[1:59:38] you have the money
[1:59:39] i mean i was talking to one brother in
[1:59:42] africa you know that these people here
[1:59:43] are buying preachers from africa
[1:59:46] because they have the money
[1:59:49] buying them out of the message i said
[1:59:52] how can you be so stupid
[1:59:57] huh
[1:59:58] give me her i mean
[2:00:01] which money will you give me
[2:00:04] to sell the word
[2:00:08] it goes on to show most of these people
[2:00:10] had no revelation because revelation is
[2:00:13] not about revelation is not
[2:00:16] brainwashed
[2:00:21] but they are using money
[2:00:23] they are building people houses they are
[2:00:25] building people they are buying them
[2:00:26] vehicles if you denounce william branham
[2:00:29] i'll give you this i'll give you this
[2:00:33] because they are rich
[2:00:35] they are full
[2:00:37] they are now kings
[2:00:39] they are taking over god is you know god
[2:00:42] is sanctuaries and trying to own them
[2:00:44] and pocket them
[2:00:50] and have come here in america
[2:00:52] to tell them
[2:00:54] i know some of them will listen to this
[2:00:57] let them know
[2:00:58] that they are not going to chase
[2:01:01] the message even out of america and
[2:01:02] succeed
[2:01:05] they will
[2:01:06] not will not chest they will deceive
[2:01:10] some fools
[2:01:11] the simple ones
[2:01:14] the greedy ones the blinded ones but the
[2:01:16] bride is not going to be deceived
[2:01:19] glory to god
[2:01:24] hallelujah
[2:01:25] you see you begin to turn bethel into
[2:01:28] chapels
[2:01:31] of kings
[2:01:36] don't want to start don't want and then
[2:01:38] one brother was saying brother i had
[2:01:40] wanted to invite in my church but um
[2:01:43] when i had this someone that you
[2:01:44] preached i said i said you have done me
[2:01:46] a very good service
[2:01:48] i don't even want to come to your place
[2:01:50] i don't want to
[2:01:51] to waste my strength there
[2:01:56] say god bless you you have done me a
[2:01:57] very good i'm not looking for places to
[2:01:59] preach i am a pastor i have a home
[2:02:02] church
[2:02:04] i'm not dying to preach in anybody's
[2:02:06] church
[2:02:09] i've come here because i'm a friend of
[2:02:11] bcf
[2:02:12] not because i'm dying to preach here
[2:02:26] so
[2:02:27] kings chapel
[2:02:29] kings
[2:02:30] they have reigned as kings they have
[2:02:32] great power and who made them kings the
[2:02:35] message
[2:02:36] who made them popular let me see how did
[2:02:39] they get to know those men in africa the
[2:02:41] message how did they get the addresses
[2:02:44] the message how did they get their
[2:02:46] contact because of the message and now
[2:02:48] they are using that popularity to fight
[2:02:51] it
[2:02:59] praise god but it's going to be people
[2:03:04] that are not going to be deceived
[2:03:07] and i'm not going to be deceived and i
[2:03:09] believe you are not going to be deceived
[2:03:12] glory be to god
[2:03:14] because that is a enemy device devices
[2:03:18] but there is a device from above let me
[2:03:21] tell you something as i finish let's go
[2:03:24] back
[2:03:25] to prove to you that before they came up
[2:03:28] with the thought of devising this god
[2:03:31] had already devised a device against
[2:03:34] them before they came up to devise the
[2:03:37] devices
[2:03:39] [Applause]
[2:03:43] let's find that the goddess device in
[2:03:46] jeremiah 18 also
[2:03:51] they didn't know that before they came
[2:03:52] up in jeremiah 18 18 to devise their
[2:03:56] devices in jeremiah 18
[2:03:59] verse
[2:04:00] 11
[2:04:01] let's see what god is saying
[2:04:08] now there are four go
[2:04:10] to speak to the men
[2:04:13] of judah
[2:04:19] and of the inhabitants of jerusalem
[2:04:21] saying
[2:04:22] that say the lord
[2:04:25] behold i frame evil against you
[2:04:33] and devise a device against you
[2:04:40] so before they could devise their
[2:04:42] devices
[2:04:43] god has already devised a device against
[2:04:46] those who device devices
[2:04:55] i think you better come and take over
[2:05:01] glory be to god
[2:05:04] behold i frame
[2:05:06] evil against you
[2:05:09] and he says and devise a device
[2:05:12] for him he has one device he doesn't
[2:05:14] have devices
[2:05:16] these ones have devices but for him
[2:05:19] he has one
[2:05:21] [Laughter]
[2:05:23] glory to god
[2:05:26] against you
[2:05:28] return ye now everyone from his evil way
[2:05:32] and make your ways and you are doing
[2:05:35] good
[2:05:38] and you know what they say and they say
[2:05:40] there is no hope
[2:05:42] but we will walk after our own devices
[2:05:46] ah
[2:05:51] we'll walk after our own devices
[2:05:53] and we will everyone do the imagination
[2:05:56] of his evil heart
[2:06:00] adamant stiff-necked cross the line of
[2:06:03] mercy
[2:06:04] they don't want to repent but before
[2:06:07] they devise their devices god has
[2:06:09] devised his
[2:06:12] in other words god is never taken off
[2:06:14] god
[2:06:17] don't sit there in your home and you
[2:06:19] sympathize with god
[2:06:21] [Laughter]
[2:06:24] so mr god now what are you going to do
[2:06:28] no
[2:06:33] glory be to god
[2:06:38] god is going to prove his word
[2:06:40] and he has already done it
[2:06:42] and he'll do it and over and over and
[2:06:45] over and he'll vindicate and you'll take
[2:06:47] us home and
[2:06:48] and there's going to be a bride and
[2:06:50] there is already bride
[2:06:52] and there's going to be a people that
[2:06:54] are going to stand undefeated and
[2:06:56] deceived
[2:06:57] with revelation anchored they don't care
[2:07:00] what comes or where it goes
[2:07:02] what they are going to lose what they
[2:07:04] are going to gain is not their problem
[2:07:06] who leaves them who stands with them is
[2:07:08] not their problem when they saw my own
[2:07:11] wife my own husband my own friend sister
[2:07:14] brother my relatives
[2:07:17] that's not my problem i am not the
[2:07:19] savior salvation is of the lord i'm only
[2:07:22] going to say lord help me stand
[2:07:25] [Applause]
[2:07:28] i pray for my brothers i'll pray for my
[2:07:30] friends i love them i don't hurt them
[2:07:33] but
[2:07:34] to convince me away from this
[2:07:38] impossible romans 8 comes there says i'm
[2:07:43] persuaded
[2:07:44] more than persuaded and paul says that
[2:07:47] neither death
[2:07:49] nor life
[2:07:50] things present things that are to come
[2:07:53] if it is sickness if it is trouble if
[2:07:56] it's persecution is it nakedness is it a
[2:07:59] peril
[2:08:01] nothing shall separate me from the love
[2:08:06] charity i'm hooked i'm taken
[2:08:10] it's done
[2:08:11] saturn you are wasting your time
[2:08:14] blessed be the name of the lord and i
[2:08:16] want to tell you god is here to take
[2:08:17] care of your every name
[2:08:21] here
[2:08:22] glory oh god
[2:08:24] why
[2:08:25] there is a a a holding up
[2:08:29] a reducing of the number yes
[2:08:33] but that is even better
[2:08:36] when jesus was to feed five thousand he
[2:08:38] needed five pieces of bread
[2:08:42] and they gathered twelve baskets
[2:08:46] because there has to be twelve
[2:08:48] testimonies to the 12 tribes of israel
[2:08:53] but when he was defeated
[2:08:55] the fourth house and he needed seven
[2:09:00] and they gathered
[2:09:03] seven baskets why
[2:09:06] in the shadow for the seven church ages
[2:09:12] but then last of all when they were in
[2:09:15] the sheep and jesus is warning them
[2:09:16] about the they live in the bread of the
[2:09:19] denominations they say is it because we
[2:09:21] have not carried bread they remember
[2:09:22] they had only one
[2:09:24] bread
[2:09:28] so seven plus
[2:09:29] five
[2:09:31] 12.
[2:09:32] in other words every disciple was
[2:09:34] represented by a piece of bread
[2:09:37] but eventually the 12 disappeared into
[2:09:39] one
[2:09:45] so time is coming that revelations and
[2:09:47] ministries are going to disappear into
[2:09:49] one
[2:09:51] the minister of jesus christ
[2:09:53] personalities and big men big this big
[2:09:56] that are all going to disappear into one
[2:10:01] that's all you need
[2:10:03] the word is the healer the word is the
[2:10:05] blessing what is your security the word
[2:10:08] is your you know you are everything
[2:10:11] he is everything
[2:10:13] the inexhaustible fountain no wonder the
[2:10:16] sun is stoppable and they were saying
[2:10:18] what do we do the world conditions
[2:10:21] coming conditions coming
[2:10:23] i mean we are not preachers who are
[2:10:24] going to dry out this is an
[2:10:26] inexhaustible inexhaustible fountain the
[2:10:29] world will keep coming because you are
[2:10:30] healed still here
[2:10:32] god is working on you
[2:10:35] and make sure you take the word
[2:10:38] and you are going to overcome the death
[2:10:39] i don't care how many devils are coming
[2:10:43] i'm not scared of the future
[2:10:49] you shouldn't be scared of the future
[2:10:52] that's why he came
[2:10:53] that's why he came down
[2:10:56] glory be to god
[2:11:00] so as i finish
[2:11:02] as we go to pray
[2:11:06] i think
[2:11:09] i've left so many things here but there
[2:11:11] is this inexhaustible nature of the
[2:11:14] world founded
[2:11:19] and it has a guarantee
[2:11:21] that no matter how much it's fought
[2:11:25] overlooked
[2:11:27] rejected
[2:11:28] it will always be there
[2:11:30] producing that water
[2:11:32] for those who are thirsty
[2:11:37] it will always be there
[2:11:40] and if you are here you have a problem
[2:11:42] you have sickness you have got trouble
[2:11:44] you have got this
[2:11:45] don't think you are going to look for a
[2:11:47] certain messiah certain great man try
[2:11:49] somewhere
[2:11:52] the word in you
[2:11:57] will take care of your every need
[2:12:07] sometimes
[2:12:08] we had been thinking i think brother so
[2:12:10] and so was they want to do it brother
[2:12:12] swan so was the one to do it brother son
[2:12:14] so was the one to do it and then the
[2:12:16] very person you sought was very strong
[2:12:18] in the word collapses
[2:12:23] and then they weak you
[2:12:26] you are there
[2:12:29] i mean why would god take away the
[2:12:31] powerful strong minister of brother
[2:12:34] branham and he takes him away
[2:12:36] and leaves you
[2:12:43] because that which is in you must mature
[2:12:46] and that's why jesus said it's expedient
[2:12:49] for you that i go
[2:12:53] because if i don't go the confeder
[2:12:57] will not be manifested
[2:13:02] it's very important that i physically
[2:13:05] disappear that i can come in
[2:13:08] so this man physically goes away that
[2:13:11] the one he introduces comes into us
[2:13:14] so that we don't have to keep looking
[2:13:15] for william branham
[2:13:17] pray for me brother and so pray for me
[2:13:21] let me ask you one question as i go to
[2:13:23] pray
[2:13:24] you think who is going to pray for your
[2:13:26] wife better than yourself
[2:13:32] you can send many prayer requests on
[2:13:34] forums and you know
[2:13:36] but we'll pray for your husband better
[2:13:38] than yourself
[2:13:40] pray for your daughter better than
[2:13:45] and then you just send the message and
[2:13:47] relax and sleep the brethren are praying
[2:13:51] how is you are you even in 10 of them
[2:13:53] and praying
[2:13:58] make prayer your habit your life
[2:14:02] wake up and pray and seek good all that
[2:14:04] we have is enough but only waiting to be
[2:14:08] unleashed
[2:14:10] by that trigger of your personal
[2:14:12] revelation and rising up to claim
[2:14:17] amen
[2:14:18] not as an amateur
[2:14:21] but as a son of god a daughter of god
[2:14:23] because i mean god has no big ones and
[2:14:26] small ones
[2:14:28] like the prophet says he doesn't have
[2:14:30] grandchildren
[2:14:33] who is going to work for your rapture
[2:14:37] who is going to wake you up and say come
[2:14:39] on drop your time daring daddy wake up
[2:14:42] we are going in heaven no
[2:14:46] it will be all
[2:14:49] whoever will be going will be going
[2:14:52] so work out your salvation work it out
[2:14:56] there is not a part
[2:14:57] it's already done yes
[2:14:59] but prayer
[2:15:02] why do you think jesus prayed
[2:15:09] did he need you to pray
[2:15:11] but why did he pray
[2:15:13] and why shouldn't you pray
[2:15:15] why should you seek god
[2:15:17] these demons here that are morality
[2:15:20] moving around
[2:15:22] the only way you watch out against them
[2:15:25] is through prayer
[2:15:29] being in contact with your god
[2:15:32] a personal relationship with your god
[2:15:40] until you have him where you wherever
[2:15:43] you are
[2:15:44] in your office you feel his princess
[2:15:47] in your house you feel his princess you
[2:15:51] are in the kitchen you feel his princess
[2:15:54] wherever you are
[2:15:58] that's the challenge
[2:16:01] and he gives you special grace he is
[2:16:03] going to equip you to come to that
[2:16:06] but let there be that willingness that
[2:16:09] fast that craving that that desire
[2:16:14] the prophet says he's even
[2:16:17] wanting to hear you call him on the
[2:16:18] scene he's he's yearning to hear you
[2:16:21] call him
[2:16:24] now we are remaining with one challenge
[2:16:26] if you think this message is true let
[2:16:29] that god come and show himself
[2:16:32] yes
[2:16:34] and this is a very ripe time
[2:16:37] for him to come and prove that the
[2:16:39] message the vindication the anointing
[2:16:41] the power didn't go with malachi 4 he's
[2:16:44] actually more here now
[2:16:49] god
[2:16:50] doesn't do what he's going to do in the
[2:16:52] prophet god reveals
[2:16:57] what he's about to do
[2:16:59] through his servants the prophet
[2:17:01] surely the lord god shall do nothing
[2:17:06] but first revealeth the mystery of what
[2:17:09] he's going to do
[2:17:10] through
[2:17:12] his servants the prophet so the prophet
[2:17:14] just revealed what god is going to do so
[2:17:18] the doing time is now
[2:17:20] [Applause]
[2:17:23] this is the doing time and where is he
[2:17:26] going to do it through you in you
[2:17:29] we are here to glorify him we are here
[2:17:32] to prove the devil a liar
[2:17:34] we are here to prove the skeptics that
[2:17:36] they are wrong
[2:17:37] we are here to prove them that their
[2:17:39] message is real and that the devil is a
[2:17:42] liar and that we are going home
[2:17:46] come on
[2:17:49] that's why you are here that's why it is
[2:17:51] you who is still here
[2:17:53] not your father not the other one not
[2:17:55] the other one or the other one leave the
[2:17:57] other ones alone
[2:18:00] you are here
[2:18:01] and this is your time
[2:18:04] may god bless you
[2:18:05] let's stand up
[2:18:11] oh hallelujah
[2:18:15] think about it friends as we humble
[2:18:17] ourselves and close our eyes
[2:18:20] you can feel his princess i can feel his
[2:18:22] premises is here
[2:18:25] anything can happen
[2:18:29] i mean i don't even need to tell you to
[2:18:31] do what
[2:18:32] you can tell him what you want done in
[2:18:35] your life
[2:18:36] and believe in your heart
[2:18:38] i'm just going to pray together with you
[2:18:40] if you want to be remembered in prayer
[2:18:42] please
[2:18:43] just lift up your hand
[2:18:45] and we pray
[2:18:46] loving heavenly father
[2:18:48] i want to thank you for this evening i

[2:19:09] chose the vessel
[2:19:13] he suffered
[2:19:15] he was abused
[2:19:17] he was rejected
[2:19:19] but he stood
[2:19:21] against the whole world against all the
[2:19:23] demons
[2:19:25] to bring this message the way he wanted
[2:19:27] it to come
[2:19:30] and we are here
[2:19:31] the privileged
[2:19:33] recipients of the same
[2:19:36] why would we let you down
[2:19:40] why would we be half baked
[2:19:42] in the time of maturity in the time that
[2:19:45] the sons and daughters of god are
[2:19:47] supposed to be manifested why would we
[2:19:50] have to become temples of spirits when
[2:19:53] the heaven is full of the holy spirit
[2:19:56] why would we be weaklings
[2:20:00] moving around as if heaven is not behind
[2:20:03] us
[2:20:04] why would we be beggar
[2:20:09] why should we struggle with the demons
[2:20:11] and spirits and sicknesses and
[2:20:13] weaknesses as if you never suffer
[2:20:16] uncover and pay their price

[2:25:32] love him because he's faithful amen love
[2:25:34] him because he's true
[2:25:36] love him because he never will fail
[2:25:39] amen i appreciate the word more than i
[2:25:41] ever have in my life
[2:25:44] it gets stronger
[2:25:46] as i get weaker the message gets
[2:25:48] stronger
[2:25:49] amen as i find myself more incapable of
[2:25:53] doing anything right i find how perfect
[2:25:55] the word is to do everything in my life
[2:25:57] that i can't do myself
[2:25:59] i found the message to be true
[2:26:02] amen
[2:26:03] i was thinking as brother abraham was
[2:26:05] preaching
[2:26:07] about isaac and rebecca how eleazar and
[2:26:10] brother ben was our eliezer went to
[2:26:13] fetch a bride for isaac and
[2:26:15] eliezer went with the message and
[2:26:18] rebecca believed it and laban and the
[2:26:20] other family members they were involved
[2:26:22] and and finally rebecca accepts the word
[2:26:24] and she travels all the way back to meet
[2:26:27] isaac and they meet they unite and he
[2:26:29] takes her into his mother's tent they
[2:26:31] become one
[2:26:34] i just imagine you know
[2:26:36] can you imagine if laban comes for a
[2:26:38] visit some years later
[2:26:41] it says oh rebecca rebecca i found out
[2:26:43] we're wrong eliezer wasn't a true
[2:26:45] servant
[2:26:49] he was an imposter and and those gifts
[2:26:51] that he brought he he got him from
[2:26:53] another source and eliezer wasn't true
[2:26:56] and can you imagine rebecca's saying
[2:26:58] it's too late amen i've been in the
[2:27:00] tenth i'm impregnated by isaac
[2:27:03] we've become one amen now it's not about
[2:27:06] whether eliezer was true or not true
[2:27:08] amen i've already been united with isaac
[2:27:11] the promised son
[2:27:13] listen the arguments don't matter
[2:27:15] anymore
[2:27:16] the criticism doesn't matter anymore if
[2:27:18] you've united with christ and become
[2:27:20] pregnant with the word of god it doesn't
[2:27:23] matter anymore it's too late to decide
[2:27:25] if it's right or wrong you're
[2:27:26] impregnated by the word
[2:27:29] it doesn't change anything amen somebody
[2:27:32] can say you know brother brenham was a
[2:27:34] liar and you say praise god and they say
[2:27:36] why you say praise god because god can
[2:27:39] use a liar to unite me with christ
[2:27:42] that's the power of god amen
[2:27:45] so it doesn't matter anymore it's too
[2:27:47] late amen let it be too late for you
[2:27:51] i mean let the reality of what we
[2:27:53] received make all the accusations
[2:27:55] it doesn't matter it's too late
[2:27:58] it can't change anything
[2:28:00] i've already been united with christ
[2:28:04] and what's growing in me will not stop
[2:28:07] growing because it's the reality it's
[2:28:09] the life it was the purpose it was the
[2:28:12] point of the message you cannot stop the
[2:28:14] message by stopping the messenger it's
[2:28:17] too late because the messenger brought
[2:28:19] the message and the message is alive and
[2:28:21] a bride you would have to stop every
[2:28:23] elect member of christ's bride to stop
[2:28:25] the message and you cannot stop this
[2:28:28] message
[2:28:29] too late
[2:28:32] so you can fight the prophet all you
[2:28:33] want
[2:28:35] but you're fighting a losing battle
[2:28:38] because the message is alive and a bride
[2:28:41] she's received her christ her isaac and
[2:28:43] she's now impregnated now the word is in
[2:28:45] her
[2:28:47] and you can't stop that
[2:28:50] and for that
[2:28:51] i say thank you god
[2:28:55] now god let me act like it let me live
[2:28:58] like it let me believe like it let me
[2:29:01] turn a deaf ear to everything else and
[2:29:02] give my whole life to this reality that
[2:29:05] i've received and quit listening to
[2:29:07] accusations and quit worrying about all
[2:29:09] these things let me put all my focus to
[2:29:11] this thing right now to this life
[2:29:14] because this is what you've called me
[2:29:15] today
[2:29:17] how many want to dedicate yourselves to
[2:29:19] what you are
[2:29:20] how many want to dedicate yourselves to
[2:29:22] the reality that you receive
[2:29:25] and quit listening to anything else and
[2:29:27] just focus on this that's what i want to
[2:29:29] do as i go home today what i want to do
[2:29:31] is be more dedicated to this reality
[2:29:33] than anything else i want to be more
[2:29:35] focused on the reality that i receive
[2:29:37] than anything else in this world
[2:29:40] that's the greatest desire of my heart
[2:29:43] amen
[2:29:44] god is good friends
[2:29:46] god is real this message is a living
[2:29:49] reality
[2:29:51] it's not books and tapes
[2:29:53] it's a living bride manifesting christ
[2:29:57] praise be to god
[2:29:58] [Music]
[2:30:00] amen
[2:30:01] if you want to be that committed bribe
[2:30:04] and focus though you raise your hands
