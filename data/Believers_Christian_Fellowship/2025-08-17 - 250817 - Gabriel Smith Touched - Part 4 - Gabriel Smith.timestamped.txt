[0:00] Some folks are building hopes down here
[0:03] and planning ahead. So busy with their
[0:07] fortunes, they forgot what Jesus said
[0:12] about the wars and earthquakes and the
[0:15] victories budding.
[0:18] But there's a group of people getting
[0:21] ready to leave. Ready to leave in the
[0:26] twinkling of an eye. Making investments
[0:31] in that bank up in the sky.
[0:34] Happy preparations, not a reason to
[0:38] grieve. Are you in that number getting

[14:43] And we don't want to be like that hog
[14:45] sitting underneath the tree with the
[14:48] apples hitting him on top of the head
[14:50] day after day and he fails to look up

[14:55] him.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; We want to give him the praise that he's

[15:04] truly is worthy this morning.
[15:06] So just greet you in the name of the
[15:09] Lord and um happy to see everyone out
[15:13] this morning and uh just want to greet
[15:16] the visitors here and say God's
[15:18] blessings be upon you. Uh we got brother
[15:22] Benad from uh uh Omaha, Nebraska, his
[15:26] wife and two children. God bless you.
[15:29] And then uh pastor uh brother Ezra uh
[15:32] from India. God bless you too, brother.
[15:35] and brother Ilia his parents is here as
[15:37] well. So anybody else that may be
[15:40] visiting you your family now. So God
[15:43] bless you and uh God bless each one and
[15:46] we just want uh pastor to have a restful
[15:49] time and uh come back refreshed. So just
[15:53] pray God's blessings be upon him. Um if
[15:56] we can we'll just get right into the
[15:58] word of God this morning.
[16:01] I I would like to um
[16:04] read uh Hebrews chapter 4
[16:08] and uh something
[16:12] I just got a little something on my
[16:13] heart. Trust it'll be a help to you.
[16:16] Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12.
[16:23] For the word of God is quick and
[16:25] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[16:27] sword, piercing even to the dividing a
[16:31] sunder of soul and spirit, and of the
[16:33] joints and marorrow, and as a discerner
[16:36] of the thoughts and intents of the
[16:38] heart. Neither is there any creature
[16:40] that is manifest in his sight. But all
[16:43] things are naked and open unto the eyes
[16:46] of him with whom we have to do. Seeing
[16:49] then that we have a great high priest
[16:51] that is passed into the heavens, Jesus
[16:54] the son of God, let us hold fast our
[16:57] profession.
[16:59] For we have not a high priest which
[17:02] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[17:03] our infirmities,
[17:05] but was in all points tempted like as we
[17:08] are yet without sin.
[17:10] Let us therefore come boldly unto the
[17:12] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[17:16] and find grace to help in time of need.
[17:19] And then I'd like to read in Revelation
[17:22] 1 verse 5
[17:26] and and from Jesus Christ who is the
[17:28] faithful witness and the first begotten
[17:31] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[17:35] of the earth. unto him that loved us and
[17:38] washed us. And brother Brandham says
[17:40] that word washed means loosed. He loosed
[17:44] us from our sins in his own blood. And
[17:48] hath made us kings and priests unto God
[17:51] and his father. To him be glory and
[17:54] dominion forever and ever. Amen.
[17:58] I'd like to speak to you this morning by
[18:00] the help of the Lord on Touched Part 4.
[18:04] Let's bow our heads.
[18:06] Heavenly Father, truly we love you today
[18:10] and just grateful to be called by your
[18:14] holy name, the name that's above every
[18:17] name. And we want you to feel welcome
[18:22] here this morning, Lord. We
[18:26] sung songs of worship and and we want
[18:30] our hearts to have a melody of worship
[18:34] in it that's welcoming to you. We want
[18:38] our spirits to welcome you, Lord, here
[18:42] that you would have the place of honor,
[18:45] the seat of honor in our hearts that you
[18:48] could minister to our needs. For truly
[18:50] we are a needy people. Lord, I I am a
[18:54] but a mortal and I I don't know what
[18:58] your children need this morning. I I
[19:00] just know what's been ringing in my
[19:02] heart all week. And so I I pray that
[19:05] you'd just help me to deliver
[19:08] what I I feel you've given me. And I
[19:11] pray that my brothers and sisters would
[19:14] reach into the bread basket and and
[19:17] receive their portion that's for them.
[19:20] We just ask your blessings upon each
[19:23] one, Lord. And just asking for brother
[19:27] Chad and the family to have a time of
[19:30] rest and refreshment, enjoy one
[19:33] another's company. And pray that you
[19:36] just uh bring him back safely, Lord. and
[19:40] asking that as we as gathered here as
[19:42] believers this morning that you would
[19:45] bless and refresh us as well with your
[19:48] presence and that you would receive Lord
[19:52] uh our thoughts, our hearts, all that we
[19:56] are. We yield to you and ask for you to
[19:58] have your way and we ask all these
[20:01] things to be so in Jesus holy name.
[20:03] Amen. God bless you. You can be seated.
[20:10] Um,
[20:12] so I I um
[20:16] I um
[20:20] I just um
[20:24] I feel that um I know maybe four parts
[20:28] may may seem a little long, but
[20:30] sometimes you just can't get away from
[20:32] things. And uh so I trust that uh this
[20:35] is the mind of the Lord. Um, but I I do
[20:40] believe that we we live in a a uh a hard
[20:44] world and and uh you know as as we read
[20:49] there in um in uh Revelations uh and we
[20:54] read in Hebrews that he's the high
[20:56] priest that can be touched by the
[20:58] feeling of our infirmities. But I I
[21:01] wanted to read to you in Revelations
[21:03] that um ye are kings and priests
[21:06] &gt;&gt; and God hath made you kings and priests.
[21:10] And so uh you uh you are a priest this
[21:13] morning. And so you are an intercessor.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; And so if if he's a high priest that can
[21:20] be touched by the feeling of our
[21:21] infirmities, then I believe that we
[21:24] ought to have that same touch as
[21:25] believers. But uh something that I I I
[21:29] shared with you a service or two ago
[21:32] that uh brother Brandham said when he
[21:34] was talking about Christ in the first
[21:36] coming uh that uh Zachcharias when he
[21:41] was in the temple he was he was doing
[21:43] his godly duty. He was in the temple. Uh
[21:48] but when the angel Gabriel came to him,
[21:50] he didn't believe the word the message
[21:53] that was spoken to him. Even though he
[21:56] had he he was keeping all the eyes
[21:58] dotted and the tees crossed, but but
[22:01] when the message came directly to him,
[22:04] he was calloused.
[22:06] and and and the the the the the fearful
[22:10] thing is that at the first coming of the
[22:13] Lord, the calluses was on the priesthood
[22:17] and and and the and the and the and the
[22:17] and the and the and the and the and the
[22:17] and the and the and the and the and the
[22:17] and the and the and the and the and the
[22:17] and the and and but I I I read
[22:20] Revelations cuz I wanted it to take it a
[22:22] step further because you can see that
[22:25] quote and go, "Oh, brother Gabe better
[22:28] watch out." And you you you can read
[22:31] that quote and go, "Oh, brother Chad
[22:33] better watch out." Right? Brother Ben
[22:36] better be careful. But but ye are kings
[22:40] and priests.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; And so don't don't put it just on the
[22:44] ministry here.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; But you have a ministry.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; And and so the point is is the min that
[22:51] the the calluses was on the priesthood.
[22:54] And so that priesthood couldn't feel the
[22:57] touch like it was supposed to feel.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; And and we live in a in a in a hard
[23:03] world. We live in a callous time. We
[23:06] live in a critical time. We live in an
[23:08] indifferent hour. We live in a time
[23:11] where it's all about me, myself, and I.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; And and we live in a selfish, selfc
[23:18] centered world. That's all about me.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; Right?
[23:23] &gt;&gt; And and because of that, it's it's easy
[23:25] for us all to fall susceptible to those
[23:29] calluses that come upon the body. And
[23:33] and so I I I believe that that there's a
[23:36] reason why God would tell us in
[23:39] Ephesians the 4th chapter, grieve not
[23:42] the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are
[23:44] sealed until the day of redemption, cuz
[23:46] you can grieve him.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; Don't mean you lost your seal, but you
[23:50] can grieve him.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; He says, "Let all bitterness Well, wait
[23:55] a minute. I thought we were sealed,
[23:58] &gt;&gt; right? Lord,
[24:00] &gt;&gt; let all bitterness and wrath, wrath
[24:04] &gt;&gt; and anger and clamor and evil speaking
[24:07] be put away from you with all malice.
[24:10] And be ye kind one to another,
[24:16] &gt;&gt; tender. Well, wait a minute, brother
[24:18] Gabe. I'm sealed by the Holy Spirit.
[24:21] Well, keep reading
[24:24] &gt;&gt; cuz you can grieve him.
[24:27] And so God is telling us that we got to
[24:29] be mindful of these things.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; We got to be tenderhearted.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; Don't be so too tough.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; Because remember, that's the hour that
[24:41] we live in,
[24:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[24:44] &gt;&gt; Where where it's it's it's harsh. It's
[24:47] critical. It's cutting. And and if we
[24:51] ain't careful, we can lose the
[24:52] tenderness of our touch. Because
[24:55] remember when when brother Brandham was
[24:58] was in his, you know, the the the in
[25:01] 1963 when those seals were revealed and
[25:04] and and the the book was loosed right to
[25:07] him and then he gave it out to the
[25:10] people.
[25:12] To me, that was one of his greatest
[25:15] darkest hours because it was when it was
[25:18] when if you remember in standing in the
[25:20] gap, he said he had lost a feeling for
[25:24] the people
[25:25] &gt;&gt; because they wouldn't receive his
[25:27] message. And so at at at the revealing
[25:31] of the book of of the lamb's book uh the
[25:34] book of redemption when the open when
[25:35] the book would become opened his
[25:38] greatest problem was that he lost a
[25:41] feeling
[25:43] &gt;&gt; for the people
[25:46] because of rejection
[25:49] and if and if he is uh to me I believe
[25:53] he's a pattern for us and so when that
[25:56] open book is being reveed reveed to us.
[25:59] Could we not be susceptible to that same
[26:02] situation?
[26:04] Do you think it was a coincidence that
[26:07] it happened that way? I I don't think
[26:10] so. Because when when we have this
[26:13] precious word,
[26:15] rejection will come. And it's and it
[26:18] must needs be that offenses would come.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; But it's how do we handle them when
[26:24] those offenses come?
[26:26] see to be tenderhearted. It also tells
[26:29] us in the book of Colossians
[26:34] chapter 3, it says, now I want you to
[26:36] notice it tells you to put something on.
[26:39] How many is the elect of God?
[26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; Right?
[26:44] Put on therefore as the elect of God,
[26:47] holy and beloved,
[26:50] boughs
[26:52] of mercies.
[26:55] Now, that boughs of mercies speaks of
[26:58] inward affection and tender mercies. And
[27:02] so,
[27:04] if you're the elect of God, why would
[27:06] God tell you to put that on? Cuz when
[27:08] he's saying, "Put it on," he's talking
[27:10] about like a jacket.
[27:12] &gt;&gt; Put it on.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; So, in other words, you don't come with
[27:15] it equipped. You got to put it on.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:25] Okay, look, you know, okay, listen. You
[27:28] know, people, you know, people kill me.
[27:29] They want to argue where the mercy seat
[27:31] is. It's in the bride. It's not in the
[27:33] bride.
[27:36] Don't argue. Show me where it's at.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; If if if the mercy seat is in your
[27:42] heart,
[27:43] &gt;&gt; well, let me see it.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; Because if if if you're going to argue
[27:46] with me, I don't care if you got the
[27:48] right quote or not.
[27:50] &gt;&gt; I want to see mercy.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you are a mercy, then it ought
[27:54] to be on display.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; I ought to see it in your life. I ought
[27:58] to see it on the job.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Gabe, but you know, well,
[28:03] we got No. Well, you can only show mercy
[28:06] here.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; You can't show it out there.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; How are they going to receive mercy
[28:14] unless mercy shown? Amen.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; I got three or four amens on that and I
[28:21] got a couple all rights.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; See? See? See where we're at?
[28:28] Be because it's it's it's this harsh,
[28:34] cold,
[28:36] indifferent.
[28:37] I'm too busy.
[28:45] Amen.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; And and when that happens, we lose
[28:53] our touch.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Because if you're if you're a king and a
[28:58] priest,
[29:00] what is a priest? A priest is a servant.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; See, we want to be the bride. And it's
[29:08] like, no, the bride is a servant
[29:13] &gt;&gt; to Christ.
[29:16] Amen.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; Is that right? And how do we serve
[29:20] Christ? By serving one another. And it's
[29:22] not just serving us one another. Because
[29:26] how do you know that that that tatted up
[29:30] thugged out
[29:32] &gt;&gt; uh uh uh uh uh gangster on your job
[29:37] &gt;&gt; is not part of the elect lady. Amen.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; And if you can humble yourself in such a
[29:42] way
[29:43] &gt;&gt; that you can shine light on their path
[29:46] &gt;&gt; that that that when it was darkness like
[29:49] as in Egypt, they will see a go and see
[29:53] light in your dwelling place.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Right? When when Pharaoh's heart was was
[29:59] hardened,
[30:03] &gt;&gt; the Bible says that there was light in
[30:06] Gan
[30:08] &gt;&gt; when when it was so dark when it was so
[30:11] dark, so black that it could be felt.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "But the Lord hardened
[30:19] Pharaoh's heart so that he would not let
[30:22] the children go. Every time one of those
[30:25] plagues fell, it hardened them.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; Look at look at Daniel and
[30:30] Nebuchadnezzar's dream. It went from a
[30:33] gold to the to the silver and right
[30:36] brass and iron. Brother Brandham said,
[30:39] "If you watch each one of those
[30:41] kingdoms, those metals got harder and
[30:43] harder."
[30:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; And it came all the way down to the 10
[30:47] toes and it was iron and clay. Yeah.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; Romanism and Protestantism.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; But it got harder the closer it got to
[30:59] that stone coming down and crushing it.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; And that's the hour that we live in.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; Iron.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; But we are called to be gold.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:13] Look, brother Brennham says, "I see over
[31:16] here on my left a little, even some
[31:19] little children. You know what?"
[31:22] Brother Brandham sees a child children.
[31:25] He goes, "The scripture speaks of little
[31:27] children leading them in Isaiah the
[31:29] chimp chapter. their hearts not been
[31:33] pulled through so much of the world.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; Till they're young and tender.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; They love God.
[31:48] Listen, little ones. They love God
[31:52] and God loves them.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; And watch. And he can talk to them.
[32:02] We've seen so many disappointments and
[32:04] things. It's hard
[32:07] for our hearts.
[32:12] You know, we we live we live where
[32:17] I don't have my phone. Uh but that we
[32:21] live in in a in an hour where you could
[32:24] you know you if you have a news feed
[32:29] there's things that come across that
[32:31] that shouldn't
[32:34] &gt;&gt; and you're innocent.
[32:36] But remember when you look at those
[32:38] things you're pulling your heart through
[32:40] them.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; And what it does is it hardens you. If
[32:44] the prophet would say these true love
[32:47] stories and things, he says, he says,
[32:50] "And many times we pull it through old
[32:53] true story magazines and stuff of the
[32:56] world that should never have been there.
[32:59] It's callous." It God will take every
[33:03] callous off of you. You You think about
[33:06] because we have this phone and there's
[33:08] these live feeds and and everything's so
[33:11] interconnected.
[33:14] If you ain't careful.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; All those things become common to you
[33:19] and it become and it numbs you.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Look, you ain't got to watch television
[33:25] and Netflix and whatever. You just look
[33:28] at the news constantly and be consumed
[33:31] with that.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; And you'll see so much death to it just
[33:34] becomes another number.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; Hollywood has so made it to where they
[33:40] made it now. They they way back when
[33:42] when I was a little boy. You remember uh
[33:44] Indiana Jones? Remember that? Remember
[33:46] that? It's okay. You ain't backslid. Go
[33:48] ahead. You Come on. You're like, I don't
[33:50] know what to do.
[33:54] Somebody may see me.
[33:56] All right, brother Brock. You go ahead,
[33:58] brother. Yeah. Amen, brother. Be brave,
[34:01] brother. Be lead the lead the charge,
[34:03] brother. Yeah.
[34:07] But you remember there's a part in
[34:09] Indiana Jones when Indiana,
[34:13] you know, you know, the music and and
[34:16] Indiana's running through the through
[34:18] the city and, you know, got the whip and
[34:21] and there's this uh, you know, chic tap
[34:23] guy. He pulls out this great big sword.
[34:26] Look, you already laughing. You know
[34:27] where I'm going. Great big old sword.
[34:32] He pulls out some ninja stuff and in the
[34:34] end it like this he just picks it up and
[34:36] goes bam.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; And you know what? Just like you just
[34:41] did, you laughed to death. That's right.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; You laughed at death.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what the enemy does.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; He makes you laugh at death. And when
[35:00] you laugh at death, I'm I'm not
[35:02] condemning you cuz I laugh too. I
[35:04] &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; That's how the enemy works.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; He just got you to laugh at death.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; And you know what it does? It
[35:13] desensitizes you.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; It callouses you.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; To where to where death doesn't matter
[35:18] anymore.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; Just just look look just like
[35:22] homosexuality.
[35:23] What did they do way back in the 70s?
[35:27] They would have men dress up like women
[35:30] and they would make a joke out of it
[35:32] &gt;&gt; so that we would laugh at it.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Right?
[35:35] &gt;&gt; And what it did is it numbed us
[35:38] &gt;&gt; to where it no longer affects us.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; See, Satan is so slick in how he works.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; He's so smooth in how he works. And and
[35:50] and and if we ain't careful, then then
[35:53] we lose the tenderness. Amen.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; We lose the touch to where it doesn't
[36:00] affect us like it should to when death
[36:03] happen. You say, "Oh, brother Gabe,
[36:04] that's just a movie."
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; There's a reason why the prophet of God
[36:10] said, "Women don't blush anymore."
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Men Men are so callous. I want to ask
[36:18] you, brothers, when's the last time you
[36:20] hugged your child?
[36:28] And you say, "Brother Gabe, my I don't
[36:30] care."
[36:32] Stop using your family as an excuse.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Stop using your childhood as an excuse.
[36:38] I got somebody really close to me. When
[36:41] I was just a little boy, that person
[36:42] told me, "Listen, I was I was abused as
[36:45] a child, but that does not give me an
[36:47] excuse to be abuse somebody else. And
[36:49] when I was just a little boy, that
[36:51] always stuck and rang in my heart
[36:53] because I've heard many times people
[36:55] say, "Well, I was abused and that's why
[36:56] I did it."
[37:01] &gt;&gt; But but when that person so close to me
[37:03] told me to, it was just like some it was
[37:05] like, "Yeah, just because of your past,
[37:08] your past does not predict your future."
[37:11] [Music]
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; We can use those things as an excuse
[37:16] &gt;&gt; and we can say, "I'm going to die die
[37:18] out today." Well, what about dying out
[37:20] to your past so it doesn't affect your
[37:23] present day?
[37:25] &gt;&gt; Listen, our our children need to feel
[37:29] the touch of a daddy.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Our children, you you say you say, "I'm
[37:34] not built that way. I was abused as a
[37:36] child. I was molested." Whatever it may
[37:39] be, that does not mean you can't
[37:42] overcome now.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:46] You may have a harder road to go, but if
[37:49] you don't overcome,
[37:51] &gt;&gt; all you're going to do is pass that hurt
[37:53] on to your family.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; It may not be in the form of that abuse,
[37:57] but there'll be a void in their life
[37:59] because of it.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Because you never dealt with it,
[38:04] &gt;&gt; and you say you you can be an oldtimer
[38:07] and say, "Brother Gabe, my children is
[38:09] fully grown." And when you say that, it
[38:11] cuts me to the heart.
[38:14] But listen,
[38:16] I I'll tell you this. You know what you
[38:18] can do?
[38:20] You can pull that grown child
[38:24] under your arms
[38:26] and you can say, "I'm sorry."
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; See, too many times we as parents, we
[38:35] think, "Well, they're my children." If
[38:36] if if you can't look in your rolodex of
[38:39] life and not see where you apologize
[38:42] profusely to your children, you've got
[38:44] too much pride in your life.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; You think you're the man of the house
[38:51] and you're missing the mark.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; I'll say it again. You think you're the
[38:57] man of the house and you're missing the
[38:58] mark,
[38:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Because because those are not your
[39:02] children. Those are God's children.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the moment we take treat them
[39:07] as secondass citizens, we are absolutely
[39:10] flat dead wrong. I don't care how much
[39:12] of the open book you have.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right, friends. We can
[39:17] get so caught up where we think that
[39:18] they're not important. Listen, when I go
[39:20] over to that Sunday school, I fear and
[39:22] tremble just the same as I am right here
[39:24] at this pull pit.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; I don't care Sunday school or no school.
[39:28] Anytime I handle the fire of God, I see
[39:30] those tender hearts and it makes my
[39:31] heart tremble.
[39:33] I don't care video camera or not, God's
[39:35] watching.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Those hearts of those children are
[39:43] tender.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; And when we see that tenderness, it
[39:47] ought to make our hearts see, but our
[39:49] hearts become so calloused because life
[39:52] is rough.
[39:59] But we can also
[40:02] we can look at them with a tender heart
[40:03] oursel and go listen there's a better
[40:06] way.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; See we can look at our past
[40:12] and we let it predict our future.
[40:21] How how many wants a tender heart?
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. How how many listen how many wants
[40:27] to feel the touch of God?
[40:29] &gt;&gt; We we have to be tender to his touch.
[40:32] And and how do we know we're tender to
[40:34] his touch is because we're tended to the
[40:35] touch of others.
[40:42] If if if we ain't careful,
[40:46] brother Brandham, he tells us, look,
[40:48] when when we
[40:50] when we are so consumed with social
[40:52] media that the first thing we do is we
[40:55] is we connect with social media before
[40:57] we connect with God.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Something is wrong.
[41:05] are your priorities, my priorities is
[41:08] out of whack.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; And and and if you ain't listen because
[41:12] remember here here's a here's a fearful
[41:15] thing. A fearful thing is brother
[41:18] Brandham says Jesus wants to bless you.
[41:21] He wants the first place and we give him
[41:24] the last place.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. You know, we sing the song
[41:29] preeminence.
[41:31] And that seems like a great big huge
[41:33] message word, you know, but you know
[41:35] what preeminence means? First place.
[41:40] That's all preeminence means. You little
[41:42] ones, don't let that word scare you. It
[41:43] means first place.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Right? When you're in a race and you won
[41:46] first place, you have preeminence.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; You have preeminence over the race. And
[41:52] brother Brennham says he wants first
[41:53] place and we give him the last place. Oh
[41:55] yes, we got time for everything else.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; But you see him just a few minutes
[42:06] before you jump in bed, maybe at a night
[42:09] once a week and say, "Dear God, bless me
[42:11] and my brother and father and mother and
[42:14] Mr. Jones and amen." And go to bed last
[42:17] place. But he this is this is this is
[42:22] the this is I this makes me tremble.
[42:25] This makes me say let's close the
[42:27] service and let's fill the altar.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Right. Like like if you don't want if
[42:33] you don't feel a pull to the altar,
[42:35] something's wrong.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Unless you can honestly from the depths
[42:39] of your heart say, "No, brother Gabe,
[42:40] he's first place.
[42:49] Is he
[42:52] or is the phone first place when you get
[42:54] up?
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Is your news feed first place?
[43:03] Is marketplace your first place?
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Gabe, I'm just checking on
[43:12] my I didn't ask you. it it
[43:16] who's first
[43:19] because we don't
[43:21] listen and if we'd be honest if any
[43:23] probably the best one here is he's like
[43:24] a close second.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; I mean
[43:33] he says he says
[43:38] last place but he never turns you down.
[43:42] He's good to you anyhow. That's what
[43:45] makes him real to me.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; See, God wants to spend time with us.
[43:50] When when we when we we we talk about,
[43:53] you know, the the uh the five love
[43:56] languages,
[43:58] then all the brothers brothers cringe,
[44:05] right?
[44:07] Then we go. Here we go. Brother Gabe
[44:09] getting carnal. Oh, no. No. I got
[44:11] quotes. I got quotes. I'm got quotes,
[44:15] brother.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; We going to be We going to keep it in
[44:18] the message and keep it scriptural,
[44:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:23] But remember,
[44:24] we ain't all built the same.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; And and you may not be naturally
[44:30] affectionate,
[44:32] but this is why you have to know your
[44:34] family because you may have three
[44:37] children and all uh you may have five
[44:41] and all four of them ain't affectionate,
[44:43] but there's one that is,
[44:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:47] And you have to cater to that one
[44:49] differently
[44:50] &gt;&gt; than you do the other four.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't, then there will be
[44:55] a void in that child's life.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; You brothers, look, when we provide, we
[45:02] get so caught up in a good home and a
[45:05] good job and right
[45:07] &gt;&gt; cuz we're naturally providers.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; But there's more than just providing a
[45:12] roof over their head. That's right. We
[45:14] have to provide for them physically,
[45:17] &gt;&gt; but we also have to provide for them
[45:19] mentally,
[45:21] &gt;&gt; in other words, we have to equip equip
[45:23] them because remember, they're
[45:25] homeschooled. So, they don't get out
[45:27] into the public system like the rest of
[45:30] the children. So, you have to you have
[45:33] to teach them some street smarts in the
[45:37] home.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. When when I was a when
[45:42] I was back in the day, I was probably in
[45:44] 20s, late 20s. I worked at a car a car
[45:47] dealership and there was a young kid. He
[45:49] got hired in and uh he was uh he was
[45:52] homeschooled his whole life. And I heard
[45:53] his story. He he uh he had a fenced in
[45:56] backyard and that's all he could go was
[45:58] in the fenced in backyard. And he was
[46:00] raised by like his grandma,
[46:01] homeschooled. And when he had turned 18,
[46:04] I watched him at the at the dealership
[46:06] just flip out because he was 18 and he
[46:09] had no understanding.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; And he and here he was totally no social
[46:16] skills, no no no uh street smarts, no
[46:19] concept of of reality. And and it was
[46:22] sad because he was smoking Marbell
[46:24] cigarettes and drinking Rockstar energy
[46:26] drinks and he looked like a walking
[46:28] billboard. And I felt sorry for him.
[46:31] Yeah. Right.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Because that grandma just just smothered
[46:35] him.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Instead of instructing you.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; See, there's more to it than just
[46:44] protection. Cuz we can protection and
[46:47] shelter and smother and then when they
[46:49] turn 18, they have a no clue about life.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; We have to provide for them mentally.
[46:56] Amen.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; That means we got to talk about uh uh
[47:00] things that maybe make us uncomfortable.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; But listen, I would rather
[47:12] little little I got to them before Satan
[47:14] did or their classmates.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; And and you know what? Uh they they're
[47:22] blessing now cuz they're like, "Here he
[47:24] goes.
[47:27] [Laughter]
[47:29] Right. But listen, the reason why I did
[47:32] it is because I I knew when they was
[47:34] little, I wanted to break the ground
[47:36] then.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; I was breaking up the follow ground
[47:40] then. Cuz I knew once they turned
[47:43] teenage, it was already going to be
[47:45] difficult.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; But I planted seeds when they was
[47:48] babies.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; And I kept watering over and over.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I heard brother I was to say the
[47:55] other day in preaching he was talking
[47:57] about that thing. You know I ain't
[47:58] saying it but y'all know what I'm
[48:00] talking about.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; He was talking about it. He said how
[48:03] many of of you parents uh uh you and
[48:06] young he said talk to your mom and dad
[48:09] talked to you about it and not nar one
[48:11] hand went up.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; And I thought my
[48:18] is that really surely that's not how
[48:20] message people are.
[48:22] How are how is your children going to
[48:25] have healthy relationships
[48:28] &gt;&gt; unless they have an understanding from
[48:30] mom and dad?
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Come on friends.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; You had to provide for them mentally,
[48:37] physically, spiritually.
[48:43] emotionally,
[48:49] &gt;&gt; but the physically is not a roof over
[48:51] the head. When when you study when you
[48:54] study human nature, and brother Brandham
[48:56] said it's one of the greatest subjects
[48:58] is the study of human nature. When you
[49:01] study how the effects of a of of of a um
[49:05] a a a um
[49:09] if you study the effects of of the hug
[49:12] that a mama or daddy gives to their
[49:15] parent to their children, it is
[49:18] absolutely phenomenal. When you start
[49:21] studying, you would think something so
[49:23] simple as a hug. But if you love on your
[49:27] children when they're early in age,
[49:29] there's studies that that they had
[49:32] looked at when they they they studied a
[49:34] group of of children and the mothers,
[49:37] how they was not affectionate, kind of
[49:39] affectionate, overly affectionate and
[49:42] and and then they they they set the
[49:45] markers when they were babies. They they
[49:47] come back to them 30 years later. And
[49:50] those and those and those children that
[49:52] had overly affectionate parents, they
[49:55] were vastly more grounded and settled,
[49:59] firm and confident, not not hostile.
[50:04] I mean it
[50:06] &gt;&gt; and you would think what? Yeah,
[50:11] because remember
[50:13] from Genesis to Revelation
[50:18] the whole thing was God
[50:21] wanted to touch.
[50:23] God wanted to feel.
[50:29] And listen, we live in a world now where
[50:32] everybody's on edge because they don't
[50:34] want to get called by the police by a
[50:35] mistouch, right?
[50:37] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying?
[50:39] &gt;&gt; But that can affect dad.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; And because of that, because we can let
[50:48] that fear,
[50:50] &gt;&gt; come on, friends.
[50:53] But but we ought not to let that
[50:56] scarecrow keep us from loving
[51:00] &gt;&gt; our children. And listen, Dad, if you
[51:03] had if if you had a a parents that
[51:07] weren't affectionate, you have to
[51:09] recognize that. And then you have to
[51:12] then you have to go, "Wait a minute. But
[51:14] how am I interacting with my children?"
[51:17] And you say, "Brother Gabe, but I feel
[51:19] funny." Well, do it anyhow. That's
[51:20] right.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; That's what you need to die out too.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Is that funny feeling,
[51:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about no weird doctrine,
[51:32] but what I'm telling you is the children
[51:34] need to feel that security.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; That love.
[51:40] Listen, you you sisters, you know why
[51:42] you're so insecure?
[51:46] If you if you trace it back, it's
[51:48] probably because daddy never told you
[51:50] you was beautiful.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; And listen, Dad, if you got children, if
[51:59] you got s, if you got daughters, you got
[52:02] to constantly reassure them of how
[52:05] beautiful they are.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Not lay the law down about lint.
[52:14] No, you got to tell them they're
[52:16] beautiful.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; I got was that one and a half amens.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; I I Come on, brothers.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; You You You got to You listen. If you
[52:30] don't give them love,
[52:33] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Hold on. Hold fast.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. We'll we'll let the
[52:39] prophet speak then and we'll see if you
[52:42] say amen to that one
[52:48] and see if you say amen to them. Let's
[52:49] see what he says
[52:52] and see here.
[52:54] Uh
[52:57] oh my.
[53:00] He says what brought a juvenile
[53:03] delinquency was parent delinquency. the
[53:05] parent failing to take care of the
[53:07] children. You remember a few years ago
[53:09] when my boy was born that had been about
[53:12] I think about 19 now and remember the
[53:14] doctor told my wife said just let that
[53:16] kid squall
[53:19] said it ain't going to hurt him and if
[53:21] grandma come comes along to pick him up
[53:25] keep her hands off of him said he ought
[53:27] to be career broke at 6 months now you
[53:30] know better than that sound like a a
[53:33] talk of a witch doctor instead of a real
[53:35] doctor
[53:36] &gt;&gt; and then you know what It hashed out. It
[53:39] hashed out a bunch of neurotics, a bunch
[53:41] of gangsters.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Listen, God gave you that baby to love.
[53:47] I don't care how bad you spoil it, love
[53:49] it anyhow,
[53:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; What did Brother Brandham have as a
[53:55] daddy?
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; A daddy that called him
[53:59] &gt;&gt; cuz he wouldn't take a drink.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; That's the love he had.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But did he pass it on to Billy
[54:08] Paul and Joseph and Rebecca and Sarah?
[54:11] No. When he's tired and wore out and and
[54:14] a little pit and pad of feet, what's he
[54:16] do? But comes up on the knee. What's he
[54:19] do? He said, "That's enough."
[54:21] &gt;&gt; No. He throws out the other knee,
[54:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:29] &gt;&gt; He says, He says, "God gave you that
[54:32] baby to love. I don't care how bad you
[54:34] spoil. Love it anyhow." That's right.
[54:35] love it. If you don't love it now, it'll
[54:38] go up in a cold home and indifferent and
[54:41] it'll seek love somewhere
[54:43] &gt;&gt; else or something. It'll make an outlet
[54:47] for somewhere. It see
[54:54] &gt;&gt; look when I got into the when I I just
[54:57] be on I
[54:59] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. Sometimes I just hate that
[55:01] camera cuz I'm fairy to how people's
[55:03] going to interpret what I say and it
[55:05] makes me nervous,
[55:06] &gt;&gt; but but uh I don't mean that in a bad
[55:09] way, but
[55:10] &gt;&gt; uh uh so you know when I was when I was
[55:13] when when I was uh when I was uh little
[55:16] I I I I my daddy was so heavy-handed
[55:23] and and when I was at Mama's, it was
[55:25] free-for-all
[55:26] and I lived in this indifferent world of
[55:29] of of such extremes.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; And
[55:36] I I always knew the message was right.
[55:40] But but I I wish my daddy would have
[55:43] told me, "Listen, son, your mama's an
[55:45] unbeliever, and I know that you're you
[55:47] got all kind of influences." And I
[55:50] remember one day I remember one day
[55:51] daddy picked me up and and I and uh I
[55:54] got in the back of his truck and and and
[55:56] uh I was he was me and him was like
[55:58] that, you know, and he was on the
[55:59] driver's side and I was on the driver's
[56:01] side hump of the tire of the wheel bed,
[56:02] the back of the bed. That's back in the
[56:04] day when you could ride in the back of a
[56:05] truck.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Y'all remember that, right? That was
[56:08] that wasn't, you know, parent
[56:10] delinquency. That was just way it was
[56:11] back then. Yeah. Y'all remember them
[56:14] days? Yeah.
[56:17] But anyways, I'm in the back. Yeah. Dad
[56:20] there and he's looking at me in the
[56:21] mirror and I was I think Yeah. And uh I
[56:24] looked down and I had a KISS t-shirt on.
[56:29] You kissed the rock and roll heavy
[56:31] metal. And when I looked down and saw
[56:33] that I said, "Uhoh."
[56:35] And I looked at him and I'm like, "Oh
[56:37] man, I forgot to take it off."
[56:45] See,
[56:48] but I was betw twix two worlds.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; And I wish my daddy would have I wish he
[56:53] wouldn't have been cuz when I went into
[56:56] them alcohol and drugs and gangs and
[56:58] thugging and trying to be a gangster.
[57:02] The the reason why is because I just
[57:04] wanted to fit in somewhere.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; I just wanted to connect with somebody.
[57:10] I wanted somebody to love me for me.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; And too many times we as parents, we
[57:19] fail to realize our children do not come
[57:21] to this world born again.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; And you have to give them space for
[57:29] grace.
[57:31] Come on.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; But too many times we're trying to be
[57:34] the Partridge family
[57:36] &gt;&gt; and more we're more we're more worried
[57:38] about our persona amongst the believers.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; And so we're trying to dress up our
[57:43] children and we're trying to make them
[57:45] I'll come right down here with I ain't
[57:47] scared of you. I'll come right down here
[57:48] with you.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; We're we're trying to make them
[57:51] something that they're not.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; We're trying to put on some kind of art.
[57:54] It's like putting de uh crow uh dove
[57:56] feathers in a crow. trying to make them
[57:58] act a certain way and be a certain way.
[58:01] Let them live.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Let them be what they are.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Let them be free.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Listen, when my when my children was
[58:12] little babies, I told them, listen, I I
[58:14] can't make I can't make your choice for
[58:16] you. All I can tell you to do is listen,
[58:20] just please respect my convictions of
[58:22] this home.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; And I always gave them the freedom and
[58:26] the liberty. I never pressed it upon
[58:28] them because God never pressed it upon
[58:31] me. He didn't take away my choice. Why
[58:35] would I take away theirs?
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Why would I take away theirs for a
[58:39] ministry? I don't care about a ministry.
[58:42] I care about them souls.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; And because I was worried about that,
[58:48] God gave them the desire of their hearts
[58:50] because I didn't stuff it down their
[58:52] throat.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; It made it real.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; It made it personal for them.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Cuz it wasn't anything daddy did.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Daddy can go by the way grade tomorrow.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; And by God's grace, they'll still be
[59:14] standing
[59:15] &gt;&gt; because it wasn't daddy that did
[59:17] anything. If anything, daddy kept
[59:20] apologizing
[59:22] for all of his nonsense. Amen. But I had
[59:25] enough humility to say, "I'm sorry."
[59:31] &gt;&gt; And some of us brothers are so proud. We
[59:34] think we're somebody and we are nobody.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; We ought to have enough humility to say,
[59:44] "I messed up. I should be the man of the
[59:46] house, and I'm not."
[59:52] But instead, we lack pride and arrogancy
[59:55] in our headship.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; And all we do is we hinder.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; And our children don't get the touch
[1:00:10] that they need.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; You young brothers, hear me well. Don't
[1:00:18] hear me. Hear the Holy Spirit. Well,
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; You older ones, listen.
[1:00:25] Pull them aside and say, "Listen, do you
[1:00:28] say I know, brother Gabe, I messed up."
[1:00:30] Do you know how far I sorry, I'm sorry,
[1:00:34] will go?
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Our children do not need to see perfect
[1:00:42] perfection. Our children need to see our
[1:00:47] mistakes and our frailties
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; and they they need to see us rise and
[1:00:51] try again.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Our children need to see us dust
[1:00:54] ourselves off and say, "I'm sorry. I
[1:00:58] messed up."
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; That's what they need to see. When they
[1:01:04] see that, then this gospel becomes
[1:01:08] reality.
[1:01:10] It becomes reality
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; to them
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; because they realize, "Dad me messed
[1:01:17] up." And look at him.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; He's still standing.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Well, then I can mess up, too.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; I can dust myself off.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; And I can keep on going.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Our children need to see our frailty.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Listen, brother, Dad, listen. If you've
[1:01:38] never cried in front of your family,
[1:01:41] shame on you.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:47] Cuz how are they going to be able to cry
[1:01:49] in front of theirs?
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; How are they going to know how to handle
[1:01:55] brokenness?
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; How are they going to know how to handle
[1:01:59] depression? Don't put it on the
[1:02:01] ministry. I You're the priest. You We
[1:02:04] always want to be the high priest of the
[1:02:05] home when it benefits us.
[1:02:08] Oh yeah. Now let's be the high priest of
[1:02:10] the home. Now oh now we don't want to be
[1:02:13] the high priest. Now we want to put on
[1:02:14] brother Chad back in office. No no no
[1:02:17] you. No you won't be the high priest.
[1:02:18] Let's be the high priest.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Don't just cherry pick when you
[1:02:23] want to be high priest.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Be high priest 24/7
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; 7 days a week. Good time and bad time.
[1:02:29] Baby blue skies and white puffy clouds.
[1:02:33] And when the lightning's flashing and
[1:02:36] the thunder's rolling,
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; that's when you're going to be a high
[1:02:40] priest.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; When everything's falling apart and they
[1:02:43] look to daddy and daddy's got a tear
[1:02:46] rolling down his eyes, but then they
[1:02:48] says, "So, honey, God's going to get us
[1:02:51] through it."
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; See, that's
[1:02:58] that's what the Lord did.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; That's what our prophet did. Amen.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; That our prophet never never hid
[1:03:05] anything from us.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Listen, if this is the hour of the open
[1:03:09] book, are you not the open book?
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Then does that mean how can you be a
[1:03:14] closed book and an open book at the same
[1:03:15] time?
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; If you're open, if you're this you right
[1:03:19] Matthew where the books was open, right?
[1:03:20] You ma book of John that was his gospel
[1:03:23] with his interpretation what he saw
[1:03:25] Jesus. What about your book?
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Right. Listen, it don't do no good for
[1:03:30] brother Brandham to to to see that
[1:03:32] revelation in a little room. And think
[1:03:35] about this. When brother Brandham was
[1:03:38] revealing those those seven seals, he
[1:03:41] got the revelation where? Behind the
[1:03:43] pull pit? No.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; He got the revelation where? He said,
[1:03:48] "I'll meet you in there."
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; He got the revelation in this little
[1:03:53] room.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was going to make a terrible
[1:03:57] mistake and then that angel came
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; and he said the mysterious part of the
[1:04:04] week has been them angels. It's not been
[1:04:07] a man, it's been the angels.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; So when brother Brandham got the
[1:04:12] revelation, it was separate
[1:04:16] from here.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; He just shared
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; what he got in the hidden place.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; But remember remember the vision when of
[1:04:28] the the third pool in the tent vision
[1:04:30] when brother Benham and that voice was
[1:04:33] talking to him. There was people going
[1:04:34] in and out of remember I'll meet you
[1:04:36] there.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; But there was already people going in
[1:04:42] and out. So where are we going to get
[1:04:44] the revelation? Here
[1:04:47] or there?
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; And what was the revelation? It unloosed
[1:04:54] the the mystery of his life,
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:03] By the way, the disclaimer,
[1:05:07] listen, uh there there's a family up
[1:05:10] north, brother Nathaniel's, and uh uh
[1:05:13] they they come see us, you know, uh
[1:05:15] sister Kayla, brother Juan, them and Big
[1:05:17] Poppy, and and uh uh sometimes we get to
[1:05:21] fellowship, you know, and I always get
[1:05:22] the PowerPoint out. I got to get my
[1:05:24] slides and
[1:05:28] PowerPoint at home, you know.
[1:05:30] I break out the PowerPoint, you know,
[1:05:32] and I every time I talk to sister Kayla,
[1:05:34] I said, "Kayla," I said, "Listen now, if
[1:05:36] I say anything contrary to your pastor,
[1:05:37] you set that aside and follow your
[1:05:39] pastor because he's ordained God to lead
[1:05:40] you through." She got so tired of
[1:05:42] hearing me say that, she said, "Brother
[1:05:44] Gabe, you need to make a slide for
[1:05:45] that."
[1:05:48] So, I did.
[1:05:50] I gota
[1:05:52] So listen I I just so you know anytime I
[1:05:55] bring something I start talking it makes
[1:05:57] me nervous because brother Chad I I we
[1:06:00] pretty tight but I only been here a few
[1:06:02] short times. So if I ever say anything
[1:06:04] contrary just always know my heart. If I
[1:06:07] know if I preach I would never preach
[1:06:08] anything different than what our pastor
[1:06:10] believes and preaches here.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; If there's something he and I disagree
[1:06:13] on I go into office.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; I ain't trying to You understand what
[1:06:17] I'm saying? So the integrity of my
[1:06:20] heart, I would never do that cuz that's
[1:06:22] so in discord and God hates that.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Right. So anyway, anyway, so so uh just
[1:06:30] to me it just seems it just seems so
[1:06:32] real that that brother Brandon when he
[1:06:35] would get that revelation, it it was it
[1:06:39] unlocked a mystery in his life. He said
[1:06:41] the thing that he wondered his whole
[1:06:43] life, right? So if those people was
[1:06:46] going in and out of that room and
[1:06:47] getting healed, wouldn't it do the same
[1:06:49] for them?
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; So it ought to do the same for us.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; But we have to go into that hidden place
[1:06:58] with God,
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; And and
[1:07:06] brother Brandham tells us, he says, he
[1:07:08] says it'll make an outlight somewhere.
[1:07:10] Mother, take that baby. Give it
[1:07:13] fellowship and love. Now
[1:07:17] make it a part of you, which it is, and
[1:07:20] act like it. Hug it and kiss it and love
[1:07:22] it. Don't be too cold with with things
[1:07:26] of the world. God gave you that as a
[1:07:29] treasure. Raise it right. Amen.
[1:07:36] Our
[1:07:40] children
[1:07:42] need to feel.
[1:07:44] Listen, Dad. Your boys
[1:07:47] need to feel your touch.
[1:07:53] Are y'all brothers too scared to say
[1:07:54] amen to that one? Huh?
[1:08:00] Some of the fondest memories of my life
[1:08:03] is my dad loving on me.
[1:08:10] The fondest memories of my life is him
[1:08:13] sleeping and I sleeping back to back.
[1:08:16] Him putting me to bed as a little boy
[1:08:19] and my back to his.
[1:08:21] It gave me such peace
[1:08:24] and assurance
[1:08:27] when he would give me a kiss. I knew
[1:08:30] that he loved me.
[1:08:35] And some of you brothers are so bound up
[1:08:38] that you can't do it.
[1:08:44] And that's why our children suffer.
[1:08:51] That's why you That's why there's that
[1:08:53] void when they become teenage. It's cuz
[1:08:56] you don't pour in when they're little.
[1:08:58] See, when they when my children was
[1:09:00] little, I was building.
[1:09:02] And this ain't to say I I hope this
[1:09:04] don't sound like uh
[1:09:07] look at like super dad. I'm not saying
[1:09:09] it like that. But I'm just saying we can
[1:09:11] get so caught up in life, right? We can
[1:09:14] get caught up in in our careers
[1:09:17] that we lose sight of those quality
[1:09:20] times of just being present with them.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Like they don't they don't need
[1:09:30] they don't need a family devotion.
[1:09:32] They need your devotion. Right.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; They don't need a chapter. They need
[1:09:45] your chapter.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, I I know that. I know that that rubs
[1:09:53] you the wrong way, but please take it in
[1:09:56] what way I'm saying it.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about doing away from
[1:09:59] family devotions,
[1:10:01] right? But you know some of the some of
[1:10:03] the things that we can we can think
[1:10:04] about and just we can be it can become a
[1:10:07] machine.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Some of the greatest quality times we've
[1:10:13] had is not with a Bible open but it's
[1:10:16] just with an open heart.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; It's just me opening up to them and them
[1:10:21] opening up to me. Me talking to them and
[1:10:24] them talking back.
[1:10:26] Because whenever we can just sit down
[1:10:28] and not just break out the family altar
[1:10:31] book and read our chapter and verse for
[1:10:33] the day.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz we're mechanical.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; We did our checklist.
[1:10:51] And and the whole point is we miss
[1:10:54] touching
[1:10:56] our family.
[1:11:03] I'm not saying this in arrogancy.
[1:11:07] I'm saying this from an honest heart.
[1:11:11] When God called me back in the ministry,
[1:11:12] I told him I'd say whatever he put on my
[1:11:14] heart. I don't care if it cost me in my
[1:11:17] ministry, I'll say it.
[1:11:21] Cuz I'm interested in seeing deliverance
[1:11:24] in the souls of God's people.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; I know what God has done for me. And I
[1:11:28] want the same thing to be done for you.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; I want these little ones to have more
[1:11:32] than what I have.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; I want to see them little ones step on
[1:11:36] top of me and keep on climbing.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to see.
[1:11:43] If if we when when when we learn when
[1:11:47] you look at just when you think about
[1:11:48] the touch of a of a of children and
[1:11:51] parents,
[1:11:53] you know,
[1:11:54] it it it affects
[1:11:57] you. You you young brothers, please, I
[1:12:00] said it once, but I'll say it again. And
[1:12:02] I know there's lots of you young
[1:12:03] brothers going maybe, getting ready to
[1:12:06] have babies. Baby's on the way. Always
[1:12:09] be mindful of that zero to seven, eight
[1:12:11] years old
[1:12:13] because that's the time you'll check out
[1:12:15] and you need to be checked in,
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Because men are naturally geared to I'll
[1:12:21] I'll take care of it when they get
[1:12:23] older.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; But but the building blocks is when
[1:12:26] they're babies,
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; when you're establishing it. And you
[1:12:29] know what? That's the hardest time
[1:12:31] because that's when you got to work
[1:12:32] overtime.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; But that means you ain't going to get
[1:12:34] eight hours sleep.
[1:12:41] That means you're not going to get me
[1:12:43] time.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; You're going to get 5 hours of sleep
[1:12:47] time and you're going to get three hours
[1:12:50] of family time.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; And the barn's going to have to wait.
[1:12:57] I got one right.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. it it listen
[1:13:07] look
[1:13:12] I want the unfailing of realities of
[1:13:14] God.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; That's what I want. And I don't care
[1:13:18] what it takes.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; I don't care how hard it is. I don't
[1:13:23] care who I got to repent to. I don't
[1:13:26] care who I got to gravel to. If I
[1:13:28] offended somebody and I got to gravel to
[1:13:30] get their forgiveness, I'll do it.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; That's fine. that what they require as
[1:13:35] long as they can be happy and I can try
[1:13:37] to find peace with them.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; You say you would do that? Yeah. Abs.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; God knows my heart.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; I've I've done it. I I've I've I've
[1:13:50] repented sometimes and I apologize one
[1:13:52] time and a brother said, "Brother, you
[1:13:53] did it wrong cuz you said I apologize."
[1:13:57] I know. That's what I said. Wow.
[1:14:03] I said, 'Well, I said, 'Well, how how do
[1:14:05] you want me to say it? I mean, I didn't
[1:14:08] say, 'Well, that's all you're going to
[1:14:09] get out of me, buddy.
[1:14:13] That's not much of an apology.
[1:14:18] See, some people you can't cuz they
[1:14:19] don't want to receive
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; forgiveness,
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; right? It's just judgment.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; But you you tell me whatever I got to
[1:14:27] do. Like brother Bam said, if I need to
[1:14:28] push a penny with my nose down the road,
[1:14:30] whatever, whatever I got to do, you tell
[1:14:32] me what I got to do.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; And if we don't have that, why? Cuz that
[1:14:37] prophet wanted to touch the world.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; And if and if we want to be that, I want
[1:14:43] to be when I listen to that prophet, I
[1:14:46] hear sincerity of sincerity.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; That man is not preaching a sermon so he
[1:14:52] can fill three hours and pump his chest
[1:14:54] and that he preached three hours. He's
[1:14:57] trying to share the burden and labor of
[1:14:58] his heart.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; And when I hear that, I say, "God,
[1:15:02] that's what I want."
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; That's Lord, let me please someday,
[1:15:08] someday
[1:15:10] get there.
[1:15:16] But it's going to take
[1:15:18] it's going to take humility, brothers.
[1:15:22] Because I know there's some of you
[1:15:24] because you're so tight tonight today.
[1:15:26] Some of you need to repent and it may
[1:15:29] take more time. It may be a part five if
[1:15:31] brother Chad would grace me with another
[1:15:34] time behind a bullpit
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; and we'll do her
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; cuz I care about your soul.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; That's all I'm worried about.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; But we got to be honest with ourselves.
[1:15:47] And a lot of times because we have so
[1:15:50] much baggage and we've made so many
[1:15:52] mistakes, it's so much easier to just
[1:15:54] blame everybody else.
[1:15:57] But remember, you're the one,
[1:15:59] you're the man of the house.
[1:16:04] And that means you have to be
[1:16:06] accountable.
[1:16:08] And that means you have to go and say,
[1:16:10] "I was wrong
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; and I'm sorry.
[1:16:15] What can I do to try and make it up?
[1:16:24] You know, if you come with that kind of
[1:16:25] humility,
[1:16:27] I guarantee
[1:16:31] that the Holy Spirit will honor your
[1:16:33] sincerity.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; You don't have to write out a big
[1:16:37] sermonet,
[1:16:39] but if the sincerity of your heart is
[1:16:41] right, God can reach down in that other
[1:16:44] heart.
[1:16:45] and restore
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; cuz that's what he is. This is the hour
[1:16:53] of restoration.
[1:16:54] That's the hour that he works.
[1:16:59] if
[1:17:00] we'll humble ourselves.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; But because we have a perfect message,
[1:17:08] a lot of times we think we're supposed
[1:17:10] to be perfect
[1:17:12] and we fail to realize that it it's not.
[1:17:14] It's an imperfect people
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; that possesses a perfect message. Amen.
[1:17:22] [Applause]
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; See, when when we
[1:17:27] when we when we have
[1:17:30] these hard times that come,
[1:17:36] you know,
[1:17:38] the Bible says,
[1:17:41] "For thou desireest not sacrifice,
[1:17:44] else would I give it. Thou delightest
[1:17:47] not in burnt offerings.
[1:17:50] The sacrifices of God are a broken
[1:17:54] spirit,
[1:17:55] a broken and a contrite heart. Oh God,
[1:18:00] thou will not despise.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; It's when
[1:18:08] who wants to receive anything broken?
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Anybody ever get a package from Amazon
[1:18:14] broken and go, "Oh, praise God.
[1:18:21] anybody.
[1:18:23] Oh man, it's broke just like I wanted
[1:18:25] it. That's great. Yeah, no need for a
[1:18:29] return.
[1:18:32] But when you receive something broken
[1:18:34] immediately,
[1:18:36] what is it? You're right. I pick.
[1:18:42] But what does God do?
[1:18:47] What does God want?
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; See, we we we always come to church to
[1:18:53] be put together, you know, family. You
[1:18:56] notice we all got sage green on.
[1:19:10] Right. Cuz we
[1:19:16] cuz we always want to be perfect, right?
[1:19:19] Listen, you brothers and you brothers,
[1:19:21] you probably, you know, when Susan and I
[1:19:22] first got married, I didn't have the
[1:19:24] revelation to match. And she didn't want
[1:19:25] to match and I'd be like, "No, I ain't
[1:19:26] matching you.
[1:19:29] See all these brothers, you know,
[1:19:31] families be matching." I be like,
[1:19:32] "That's cheesy." You know, I was too
[1:19:34] cool.
[1:19:35] I'm too cool. I till I have my babies.
[1:19:40] Then my babies come along and they look
[1:19:42] they, brother Gabe, they look just like
[1:19:43] you. Oh, they do. Yeah. I'm pretty cute
[1:19:46] as a 2-year-old.
[1:19:55] Right. And then as soon as they because
[1:19:58] it's your family, you want to match.
[1:20:02] Right. You young brothers, you need to
[1:20:04] humble yourselves. You'll get there,
[1:20:06] brother. You'll get there. Right. Mama.
[1:20:08] Mama match. dress your neck like, "Oh
[1:20:10] man, we got to match."
[1:20:12] You'll catch it, brother. Once them
[1:20:14] little ones come, they
[1:20:17] But you know, God sees us when we're
[1:20:20] imperfect.
[1:20:23] And when we come in our brokenness, what
[1:20:25] are the sacrifices of God? It's not
[1:20:27] burnt offerings. It was a perfect burnt
[1:20:29] offering, remember? Right.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; So, he they it wasn't a perfect burnt
[1:20:34] offering. burnt offerings and
[1:20:37] sacrifices. That's not what he wanted.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; That was just a a shadow of Christ.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; So, but we want to bring our per right
[1:20:45] the perfect family. Everybody matching
[1:20:47] all right cord to cut.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Everybody in the right kind of blues
[1:20:51] look like we just like we getting ready
[1:20:53] to go to Olan Mills after service.
[1:20:56] [Laughter]
[1:21:00] Some of you young ones don't know
[1:21:02] nothing about no meals, do you?
[1:21:05] Have grandpa tell you later on.
[1:21:12] The olden mills in the corner, the
[1:21:13] signature,
[1:21:16] right?
[1:21:18] But that's not what God wants.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; God's not wanting an old mills family.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; God don't want us to come perfect,
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; a perfect sacrifice, picture perfect,
[1:21:32] Facebook family.
[1:21:38] Let me get on the fishy phase now. Get
[1:21:41] them sidetracked,
[1:21:44] right? But what does God want? God
[1:21:46] desires
[1:21:48] a broken spirit,
[1:21:51] a broken and a contrite heart.
[1:21:55] When we bring our what God wants is our
[1:21:57] brokenness, that's what he wants to
[1:22:00] receive.
[1:22:01] It's when we can humble ourselves in our
[1:22:04] brokenness
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; and say, "God, my family is broke."
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; You know, brothers, it's a hard thing to
[1:22:17] say, "My family's broke."
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; And a lot of times, because remember,
[1:22:23] brothers, we're built to suffer in
[1:22:24] silence.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; That's what we do. We suffer in silence
[1:22:30] because we don't want to humble
[1:22:31] ourselves
[1:22:33] and so we kick the can down the road.
[1:22:43] But what God wants is he wants the
[1:22:45] broken family
[1:22:47] because that's
[1:22:49] why we would need a savior.
[1:22:56] See, we want to come. We want to come
[1:22:59] the day we get saved and baptized and
[1:23:02] all of a sudden,
[1:23:05] no, no,
[1:23:08] no, no. There's still brokenness in our
[1:23:10] lives. And there's broken things that we
[1:23:13] may not realize for decades,
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; but then God will shine it to us. And
[1:23:19] then that's our opportunity to humble
[1:23:21] ourselves and say, "God, something is
[1:23:24] broken in my family,
[1:23:27] and I don't know how to fix it."
[1:23:31] But that's why we're here.
[1:23:35] If we knew how to fix it, we wouldn't
[1:23:37] have to come here.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about the ministry. I'm
[1:23:41] talking about the Holy Spirit.
[1:23:48] This is how God uses
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; this is what God uses to minister to his
[1:23:53] people.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Is broken menise
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; if if we can humble ourselves.
[1:24:04] You know,
[1:24:09] Brother Brenham tells us this. He says,
[1:24:11] "3,000 years ago, a man could meet God
[1:24:13] almost anywhere. It was a common thing
[1:24:17] for a man to meet God." It's not a
[1:24:19] common thing for man to meet God. If a
[1:24:22] man talks about it, he's considered a
[1:24:23] crazy person, somebody that's lost their
[1:24:26] mind. It's so uncommon to them in the
[1:24:28] case of Abraham in his camp. Why? It was
[1:24:31] almost everyday occasion that Abraham
[1:24:34] met God.
[1:24:38] Yeah.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Hold on. Watch what the prophet
[1:24:42] interprets the word for us.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; He talked to him not only but when he
[1:24:46] when he went down to Ger to sojourn, we
[1:24:49] find out down there that God was in the
[1:24:52] camp of Amalecch, a Philistine.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; God was in the camp of the Philistines.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:25:03] It was a very common thing. They lived
[1:25:06] in the camp of his presence.
[1:25:10] Today they live in their own
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; look at this message in the camps.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; You you pick you pick whatever your
[1:25:24] flavor is. There's a camp for you.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; If if you lean if you lean back this
[1:25:30] stiff starts you no emotion because of
[1:25:32] your childhood. There's a camp for you.
[1:25:36] That's right.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; If you lean fanatical and you want to
[1:25:42] shout and you got a hallelujah and
[1:25:45] there's a camp for you.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; If if you love the worldly music and the
[1:25:52] booglyy woogly, there's a camp for you.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; If you're stiff, tight, starchy, and
[1:25:59] uptight, and
[1:26:01] you don't want to move, there's a camp
[1:26:03] for you.
[1:26:10] and just search the internet, the
[1:26:12] interwebs, and there's plenty of them
[1:26:14] for you.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; But there's only one camp.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; That's the mystical body of Jesus
[1:26:27] Christ.
[1:26:29] And if Aimilec look cuz remember God
[1:26:32] came to Aimilec in a dream and he says
[1:26:34] you're just as good as a dead man.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; And Aimilec said, "God, you know the
[1:26:39] integrity of my heart." And God said,
[1:26:41] "That's exactly why I come to you in a
[1:26:43] dream."
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; If if if you look at that, if you look
[1:26:45] at that in the scriptures, you know God
[1:26:47] came himself. If you type in the word,
[1:26:50] if you click on that word God, it mean
[1:26:52] Elohim came to him.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Elohim came to Aimilec. He didn't send
[1:26:57] Michael. He didn't seal Gabriel. He came
[1:27:00] himself.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; The self-existent one came to AMC and
[1:27:05] said, "You're just as good as a dead
[1:27:08] man."
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; And AMC said, "Yeah."
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; And he said, "The man that lied to you
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; and deceived you,
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; I want you to go to him and have him
[1:27:21] pray for you."
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; And then I'm not only going to heal you,
[1:27:24] I'm going to heal your land. Yeah.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; you say that's unfair. Hey, you talk to
[1:27:35] God about it. I
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Hey. Hey.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; I'm just to be glad. I'm just thankful
[1:27:40] to be on the winning side.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's so many time There's so many
[1:27:44] times I think, God, I should have been I
[1:27:46] should have been uh
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:27:58] Amen.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; It's the grace of God that we're where
[1:28:03] we're at.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; You know, so many times I go down the
[1:28:07] highway and I think how many people is
[1:28:09] just
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; just drugged out of their mind, whizzing
[1:28:12] by me.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; It's the grace of God, friends, that we
[1:28:18] make it through the day.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; You know, life is so short. It ain't but
[1:28:23] just a vapor.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; One minute we're here and the next
[1:28:26] minute we're gone.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; What are we going to do with our next
[1:28:30] moment?
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Are we going to reason away what's been
[1:28:34] spoken this morning? Are we going to
[1:28:37] surrender to it and say, "God, I need
[1:28:39] help."
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam tells us, he says, he says,
[1:28:47] "How about Elijah sitting up on the top
[1:28:49] of the mountain?" The Lord told him,
[1:28:50] "Get up here, Elijah. I'll stay with
[1:28:52] you. I want some f want some fellowship.
[1:28:55] Listen, I'll stay there with you. Want
[1:28:57] some fellowship?
[1:28:59] God likes to fellowship with his people.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; You know, you know, we talked about the
[1:29:04] love language, right?
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Well, as but what I what I was I try to
[1:29:09] let me just try to get to real quick
[1:29:11] what what's been on my heart been
[1:29:12] ringing in my heart cuz I've been
[1:29:14] thinking a lot about the love languages.
[1:29:16] You know, we talk about the acts of
[1:29:18] services,
[1:29:20] right? receiving gifts and words of
[1:29:22] affirmation and you know all those
[1:29:25] different things of speaking a love
[1:29:27] language to our significant others to
[1:29:29] our families and to my shame
[1:29:33] it come to my heart just started ringing
[1:29:35] in my heart echoing in my heart over and
[1:29:36] over this week what about God's love
[1:29:40] language
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; cuz remember he'll take whatever place
[1:29:47] you give Yes.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; You give him fourth place, he'll take
[1:29:53] it.
[1:29:55] You think about that. The creator of
[1:29:57] heaven and earth,
[1:30:01] his creation will say, um, I only have
[1:30:04] time for you to have fifth place. And
[1:30:06] he'll go, I'll take it.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; The creator
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:15] takes fifth place to his creation and
[1:30:18] says, "Okay,
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; if that's what you'll give me, I'll take
[1:30:22] it."
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; How could we not serve a God like that?
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; How could we not want
[1:30:30] find Go try that find that with
[1:30:32] Muhammad? Go try to find that with
[1:30:34] Allah. Go try to find that with Buddha.
[1:30:36] You think Buddha's going to take fifth
[1:30:38] place?
[1:30:44] But the only true God
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; that created this universe
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; when we when we in our selfishness and
[1:30:55] indifference
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; gave it for decades gave him fifth
[1:30:59] place, sixth place, 10th place,
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; he never turns it down.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Young people, listen. You say, "Brother
[1:31:08] Gabe, I got so many things ahead of
[1:31:10] you." Listen,
[1:31:14] if all you had time was third place,
[1:31:17] don't discredit that because he took it.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Just be honest with yourself and say,
[1:31:26] "God, I'm sorry.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; I had so many other things ahead of
[1:31:31] you."
[1:31:32] And be honest with yourself and say,
[1:31:34] "God, I
[1:31:36] you you don't God, you don't have the
[1:31:38] preeminence in my life. I have enough
[1:31:40] sliced time sliced out for Wednesdays
[1:31:43] and Sundays
[1:31:46] to put on my tie and my shirt and my
[1:31:48] church clothes and shake the hands.
[1:31:52] Anybody?
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Be honest enough and say, "God, I'm
[1:31:58] sorry."
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Because Satan will say, "No, you you
[1:32:03] gave him. He don't want fifth place."
[1:32:07] No.
[1:32:08] the God that you serve, he took your
[1:32:11] fifth fifth place.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; And he said, "If that's all you can give
[1:32:16] me, I'll take it."
[1:32:18] See, if you look at God like that,
[1:32:21] because remember, sister, if you have if
[1:32:24] you had a daddy that never loved you,
[1:32:26] never showed you the the the affection
[1:32:29] and the love that you that you needed,
[1:32:31] and so you're always uh uh uh insecure
[1:32:35] about your looks, and you're always
[1:32:37] worried about this looks and my hair and
[1:32:39] this and well, listen, there's probably
[1:32:41] a pretty good chance the reason why you
[1:32:43] are that way is because daddy never gave
[1:32:45] you the reassurance. insurance that you
[1:32:47] needed as a baby.
[1:32:49] I remember when my children was little,
[1:32:51] a sister told me, I won't say her name,
[1:32:53] she's here in Lima, and she told me, she
[1:32:55] said, "Every time my daddy would tell me
[1:32:57] I was beautiful or he loved me, I I
[1:32:59] just" and when she told me, she was just
[1:33:01] radiant. And when she said that, I took
[1:33:04] that and I put it in my front pocket
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; because I realized sisters need that
[1:33:10] reassurance.
[1:33:12] They need it. And brothers, if your wife
[1:33:14] is so worried about that and she spends
[1:33:16] two hours in the bathroom and you think,
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; stop
[1:33:26] because it may be deeper than what you
[1:33:28] think.
[1:33:34] So you got to look deeper sometimes
[1:33:37] and stop being so crit superficially
[1:33:40] critical.
[1:33:42] But in order to do that, you got to be
[1:33:44] able to touch your wife
[1:33:46] and go to the heart and realize why does
[1:33:49] she tick the way that she ticks.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; And when you understand why she ticks
[1:33:54] the way that she ticks, then you got to
[1:33:56] tick according to that tick to
[1:33:58] counteract that tick.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; To make it start ticking the right kind
[1:34:02] of way,
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; right? And it's going to take a lot of
[1:34:05] your ticks
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; to change her tick
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; to put her tick in the right tick so you
[1:34:11] can tick with her tick.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; And then you be tick- tocking together.
[1:34:16] And I'm not talking about the internet.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; But it but it's going to take us
[1:34:26] understanding one another of why they
[1:34:29] are built the way that they are built.
[1:34:31] And sister, if you have those
[1:34:32] insecurities, then you got to
[1:34:34] understand, wait a minute, it's deeper.
[1:34:38] You are not superficial.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; You are a wounded spirit.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; You thought you was being carnal and and
[1:34:47] all about your looks and you're being
[1:34:49] vain. No. No. You're a broken little
[1:34:52] girl on the inside.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Y'all you understand what I'm saying?
[1:34:58] Yeah,
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; you got to look at those things and go,
[1:35:01] you but G, I don't I know you don't want
[1:35:03] to and that's fine. Then somebody's
[1:35:06] going to come around and preach the same
[1:35:07] exact same thing cuz eventually you're
[1:35:09] going to have to look at it.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Because God wants you perfectly whole.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; And sometimes in order to get perfectly
[1:35:16] whole, we got to get our hands dirty,
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; We got to we got to get to the heart of
[1:35:21] the matter of why we are beating the way
[1:35:24] that we are beating. Why we are
[1:35:26] responding? Why are we overreacting?
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; If we're always overreacting, there's
[1:35:32] something wrong. And it's not that
[1:35:34] situation that's making you overreact.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; If you would search it, it's something
[1:35:38] deeper.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; It's this thing down here that's buried
[1:35:43] that you have not want to pay attention
[1:35:45] to. That's the thing that needs to be
[1:35:47] addressed. And if you address that thing
[1:35:50] right there, then the overreaction will
[1:35:52] start to fade away.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:56] I know what I'm talking about.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking. You know, I'll
[1:36:00] tell you. You know, I I'll tell you
[1:36:01] this. These little ones. Go ahead. Go
[1:36:03] ahead. Try to try. Let me see you flex
[1:36:05] on one of them. See what happens.
[1:36:08] I got to be very careful. I got to be
[1:36:11] very careful because I have such a heart
[1:36:13] for children. But the reason, one of the
[1:36:16] reasons why I have such a heart for
[1:36:17] children is because my innocence was
[1:36:19] taken from me for such an early age.
[1:36:25] And because of that, because I had the
[1:36:28] things uh uh uh I didn't have that
[1:36:31] proper childhood, when I see these
[1:36:33] little ones and that innocence, there's
[1:36:35] there's a little 8-year-old boy that
[1:36:37] raises up and go, "Wait a minute, now
[1:36:38] he's a 350 lb 51y old boy and now he can
[1:36:43] do something about it."
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; And because of that, I can overreact.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; But see, I know my frailty. M
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; I've dealt with it.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; It's still there.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Remember, brother Bram talked about uh
[1:36:59] when he had the nervous tension,
[1:37:01] remember he saw it the Lord and brother
[1:37:02] and God said, "It won't bother you no
[1:37:04] more." And brother Bram says, "I know
[1:37:06] it's there, but it don't bother me
[1:37:07] anymore."
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; He could have just as good to take it
[1:37:11] away, but he didn't. He says, "So so now
[1:37:13] I know it's there, but I just walk with
[1:37:15] it. Thank you, Lord."
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; See, sometimes, friends, we're wanting
[1:37:18] this spotless personality that's going
[1:37:21] to be perfection. we're going to be like
[1:37:22] a sevenfooter and
[1:37:27] no, if
[1:37:29] it's it's our brokenness, but it's when
[1:37:31] we see our frailties and I can see that
[1:37:34] little 8-year-old boy raised up when
[1:37:36] there's some children or something
[1:37:37] happens that you know uh a couple uh
[1:37:40] couple weeks ago, Mina, she Mina is a
[1:37:42] volunteer in at the at the horse farm
[1:37:44] with these uh she works with the uh
[1:37:46] handicapped children and and one of the
[1:37:48] handicapped children uh grabbed her
[1:37:50] glasses and threw it down and and then
[1:37:53] uh uh they didn't want to tell dad about
[1:37:54] that one.
[1:37:57] I thought her hands were pretty good.
[1:38:00] They was like, "Um, Dad, um dad
[1:38:06] said, "Don't be touching my children
[1:38:08] now."
[1:38:10] Yeah, man. Polar bear come out real
[1:38:12] quick.
[1:38:14] But I handle it like a professional. I
[1:38:16] said,
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; "Praise the Lord, brother. Exactly
[1:38:18] right." I said, "Hallelujah.
[1:38:20] God still moves in the heart of his
[1:38:22] people,
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; See, because I know it's there,
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; but you have to understand your frailty.
[1:38:33] And you have to be okay with who you are
[1:38:36] as a broken individual.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; And I can share it openly because I know
[1:38:40] God gave me the ability to overcome.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? The
[1:38:45] message done something for me, friends.
[1:38:47] I have an understanding of of the that's
[1:38:49] why I love studying human nature and how
[1:38:51] human beings think. It's more than a
[1:38:53] quote to me of what brother Brandham
[1:38:54] said. I'm glad he said it because to me
[1:38:56] when I hear that message that's what
[1:38:58] rings true cuz I want to understand why
[1:39:01] I tick the way that I tick. Why am I the
[1:39:04] way that I am? Right? Don't you want to
[1:39:07] do that? I I I love this message. I to
[1:39:10] me something about it, brother. It's
[1:39:11] it's gave me freedom. It's given me
[1:39:13] liberty. And I I I just I love it.
[1:39:18] Let me can we just try to close on this?
[1:39:21] So,
[1:39:24] so when we think about this love
[1:39:25] language,
[1:39:28] you know, it
[1:39:31] what does God want?
[1:39:35] You know, so many times we look at God
[1:39:37] as how he's going to serve us,
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; but God has love languages.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; He, you know,
[1:39:51] he wants to spend quality time.
[1:39:54] Brother Brham says it's like he's become
[1:39:55] an impersonal God. No, no, no. He wants
[1:39:58] to spend time. He wants to fellowship
[1:40:00] with you. Brother Brandham says, he
[1:40:02] says, "God likes to fellowship with his
[1:40:05] people, but we won't stand still long
[1:40:07] enough for him to fellowship with.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; So it's not him."
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; It's us.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; He says, "We're so busy skipping about
[1:40:19] from place to place and so much." He
[1:40:21] says, "Sit still, Elijah. I wanted three
[1:40:23] years and six months of fellowship."
[1:40:28] We can't have in three minutes hardly.
[1:40:31] Three years and 6 months of constant
[1:40:33] fellowship. Oh, I love that. Don't worry
[1:40:36] about the cooking. We'll have that
[1:40:38] already fixed up. The crows is going to
[1:40:40] feed you and everything is going to be
[1:40:43] all right. I just want some fellowship.
[1:40:47] Again, brother Brandham says
[1:40:51] God loves to fellowship with his
[1:40:53] creature.
[1:40:55] And he goes on, it was in God in it when
[1:40:57] when Adam and Eve fell, he did not come
[1:41:01] down with a rod of judgment,
[1:41:04] but he came searching Adam. Adam,
[1:41:08] where art thou?
[1:41:14] You know, he also wants quality time.
[1:41:25] He wants to spend time with us.
[1:41:30] Brother Brandham says
[1:41:33] prayer is to come into an atmosphere
[1:41:35] where you realize that you're in the
[1:41:36] presence of God and you're moving in the
[1:41:39] deep depth of deepest of sincerity.
[1:41:42] Watch what he says.
[1:41:44] First you say a little worship.
[1:41:48] Now watch what's he what's remember Lord
[1:41:50] teach us how to pray
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; and so listen brother Brandham picks
[1:41:56] that up and he goes first you say a
[1:41:58] little words of affirmation
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; oh
[1:42:06] the almighty
[1:42:11] Lord Jehovah
[1:42:14] the self-existent one
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; you are the creator.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; You are the almighty.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; What are you doing? You're bragging on
[1:42:24] him.
[1:42:25] [Applause]
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; See, that's what prayer is. First, you
[1:42:31] say a little worship. What are you
[1:42:33] doing? You're speaking his love
[1:42:35] language. Like, like you sisters, what
[1:42:37] do you do? What do you do whenever, like
[1:42:39] brother Bram said, just a few pats?
[1:42:41] Brother Bram said, just a few pats. He
[1:42:44] It says the same thing, friends. Watch.
[1:42:46] Brother Bam says, he says, uh,
[1:42:51] God gave a man a wife to comfort him, to
[1:42:53] touch him. And anybody knows that a good
[1:42:56] wife, there's bound to be a good wife. A
[1:42:57] man could be upset in his business and
[1:42:59] walk of life and can come home no matter
[1:43:01] what. Doctor, it's that way with me.
[1:43:04] When I come overseas somewhere, I'm
[1:43:05] nervous, upset, lost sleep. I hear
[1:43:07] crying. I see little hungry children on
[1:43:09] the street crying going on. It just
[1:43:11] kills me. But then when I come home, if
[1:43:13] wife will sit down on the arm of the
[1:43:15] chair, look, physical touch and put her
[1:43:21] arm around me and just say words of
[1:43:24] affirmation. Oh, Bill, I understand it,
[1:43:27] you know, and just a few little pets
[1:43:31] from the wife means so much. The same
[1:43:35] thing a husband to a wife, that's the
[1:43:38] way God wanted it to be.
[1:43:44] Look what he also said. He says he says
[1:43:46] it it's it is a sweet uh man's life is
[1:43:49] sweeter than than to come home and he's
[1:43:51] tired and wearing a little bucket in his
[1:43:52] hand for work all day plowing or
[1:43:54] whatever it may be and walking home.
[1:43:56] Have a lovely wife to meet him at the
[1:43:58] door. Sit down on his lap a minute.
[1:44:01] Brush his brow a little. Kiss him on the
[1:44:03] cheek. Put her arm around him. Say,
[1:44:04] "Dear, I know you're tired. You've
[1:44:07] worked so hard." and give him
[1:44:08] consolation and that he knows that that
[1:44:11] arm is around him is absolutely
[1:44:15] his.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; That arm ain't been around another man.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Never is it around any other man or any
[1:44:24] other desire. And the kiss that's on his
[1:44:26] cheek is a from a real pure heart that
[1:44:28] he just loves him alone. It makes him I
[1:44:31] know makes him you stick your chest out
[1:44:34] and say, "Well, I'm not so tired after
[1:44:36] all.
[1:44:40] See, that's it. It does something to
[1:44:43] you.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:44:46] just a few pat sis.
[1:44:50] But, brother, you got to It's It's all
[1:44:53] give and take.
[1:45:00] Or are we going to just feel the
[1:45:02] coldness of Lady Osia?
[1:45:07] Are we going to feel the iron from that
[1:45:10] Roman
[1:45:11] toe?
[1:45:17] Are we going to feel the coldness of
[1:45:18] Lady Osia?
[1:45:23] Are we going to have a heart that's
[1:45:26] tender?
[1:45:28] I'm not I'm Listen, don't I'm not
[1:45:30] talking about skinny jeans and a little
[1:45:33] silly vest tied on tight. I'm not I'm
[1:45:36] not talking about that.
[1:45:39] I'm I'm talking about masculine.
[1:45:42] But masculine is not no feeling.
[1:45:46] Our
[1:45:49] children
[1:45:51] need to feel
[1:45:53] true love.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; How does a child feel? You know, you
[1:45:59] know when when a child from zero to 5
[1:46:02] like 90% of its brain is is totally
[1:46:04] formed as like about 5 years old. And
[1:46:08] there's things that are set in that
[1:46:10] child that will be there its whole life.
[1:46:14] And if you don't pour in, then you're
[1:46:16] going to miss the opportunity.
[1:46:24] You say, "Brother Gabe, I'm not built
[1:46:26] that way."
[1:46:29] Well, well, can we can we die out to
[1:46:33] oursel today,
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; brother? Do you mean more to you
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; or does your family mean more to you?
[1:46:45] See, we look at dying out to oursel as
[1:46:47] overcoming some kind of addiction or
[1:46:49] whatever, but this is what I'm talking
[1:46:51] about.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about dying out to your
[1:46:57] childhood. Break the cycle.
[1:47:00] So, so you grew up in a cold,
[1:47:02] indifferent family.
[1:47:04] Are you going to use that as an excuse?
[1:47:10] Are you going to take what the prophet
[1:47:12] says? Are you going to take what the
[1:47:14] word says?
[1:47:16] Are you going to be tenderhearted and
[1:47:18] go, "Wait a minute, that applies to even
[1:47:20] burly men."
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; That applies to every one of you.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Because you say, "Well, I got all boys."
[1:47:30] Oh, well, okay. Well, listen. What
[1:47:33] happens when all your boys have all
[1:47:35] girls?
[1:47:41] You see,
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; then you didn't impart to your boys. And
[1:47:46] then you're going to see your boys like
[1:47:48] the little ones is going to be like
[1:47:49] hugging a wall and dad's going to go
[1:47:54] here.
[1:48:01] And then you
[1:48:03] are going to look and you're gonna go, I
[1:48:07] missed it.
[1:48:11] I missed it.
[1:48:16] And and maybe you did.
[1:48:20] Maybe you messed up.
[1:48:22] But I would encourage you, Dad.
[1:48:25] I'd encourage you to go back to your
[1:48:27] children one by one,
[1:48:31] one by one,
[1:48:33] and say, "I'm sorry."
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; You know, the message I heard today,
[1:48:41] it convicted me.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; And if you from your heart
[1:48:48] say, "I didn't touch you in the right
[1:48:50] way. I was too aggressive with you." You
[1:48:54] know, I've apologized to my children so
[1:48:56] many times. So many times I they they
[1:49:00] they kind of smile like here he goes.
[1:49:05] But I do it anyways
[1:49:07] cuz on that day I don't want no problems
[1:49:09] when I get there.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; I want to say I'm sorry. I messed up.
[1:49:15] Dads are supposed to be this way and I
[1:49:17] was this way.
[1:49:20] God's word says this and I acted this
[1:49:23] way in front of you and I'm sorry
[1:49:29] and and if we as brothers as as dads and
[1:49:32] husbands
[1:49:34] if we don't go to if we don't have that
[1:49:36] kind of humility to be able to go to our
[1:49:39] families what good is the gospel?
[1:49:44] You tell me.
[1:49:50] Or we can apologize to our coworker.
[1:49:53] Well, that's because our job.
[1:49:57] We can apologize to the brother in the
[1:49:59] church. Well, that's because he's
[1:50:01] related to that family.
[1:50:08] But what about our children?
[1:50:13] What about the disappointments?
[1:50:16] What about the disappointment that we've
[1:50:18] been to them?
[1:50:23] Are we going to have the humility
[1:50:27] and say, "God, uh,
[1:50:30] I'm sorry,
[1:50:32] Lord. Help me.
[1:50:35] Help me, God,
[1:50:37] to try to make amends.
[1:50:40] Could
[1:50:43] we stand together?
[1:51:00] And I know I know this was
[1:51:05] maybe a little different service,
[1:51:07] totally
[1:51:09] different than what I thought, but
[1:51:13] I trust that something was said to be a
[1:51:16] help to you.
[1:51:22] But
[1:51:33] brother Brandham says he says like
[1:51:35] Abraham and Sarah had been married for
[1:51:36] many years.
[1:51:38] musicians if you had come.
[1:51:42] She was infertile and she couldn't raise
[1:51:44] a child and it looked like then he would
[1:51:47] have got some young woman that was
[1:51:48] fertile that could have brought forth
[1:51:50] this child.
[1:51:52] But God likes to display his grace.
[1:51:56] God likes to take something that isn't
[1:51:58] nothing and make something out of it.
[1:52:01] For he's creator. That's why he took you
[1:52:04] and I. We were nothing
[1:52:08] that he might make his children out of
[1:52:10] us out of his own out of us who were
[1:52:13] wretched and miserable, lost and blind
[1:52:15] and unloly to make us his lovely
[1:52:18] children. It's God's purpose
[1:52:22] to do so.
[1:52:25] In all of our mistakes,
[1:52:28] in all of our loneliness, mind and
[1:52:30] spirit, you play something maybe quiet
[1:52:32] me.
[1:52:35] In all of our loneliness,
[1:52:40] [Music]
[1:52:43] I put that diamond there for a purpose.
[1:52:48] Cuz you know, sometimes we go through
[1:52:49] life and
[1:52:53] we just think we're a lump of coal
[1:52:57] and no value to us. And you know the
[1:53:02] only difference between those, they got
[1:53:04] the same makeup.
[1:53:06] [Music]
[1:53:09] One just was elected.
[1:53:14] One was predetermined.
[1:53:18] that when the pressures and strains of
[1:53:20] life, all of that coal, that coal,
[1:53:23] right, that piece of coal that's right
[1:53:24] beside that diamond was under the same
[1:53:27] pressure.
[1:53:30] Wasn't like it was a piece of coal 5
[1:53:32] miles away and one over here. And but
[1:53:35] however that happened, there was a
[1:53:37] predestinated, predetermined moment
[1:53:39] where that diamond, that lump of coal
[1:53:41] would have transforming power
[1:53:44] and it would spark
[1:53:47] And the fire would ignite in that lump
[1:53:49] of coal and it'd be transformed into a
[1:53:52] diamond.
[1:53:54] And you know that diamond can dance and
[1:53:57] shout and run the aisles and say, "I'm a
[1:53:59] diamond. I'm no longer a lump of coal."
[1:54:05] But you know what?
[1:54:07] There's still more work to be done.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's fire inside that diamond
[1:54:12] that needs to be unlocked.
[1:54:15] But you know what happens? It's going to
[1:54:17] take a wise master builder,
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; the chief jeweler,
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; to look at that diamond and flip it this
[1:54:26] way and flip it that way and go, you
[1:54:29] know what?
[1:54:30] I see this particular. It needs to be
[1:54:33] cut here and honed here and because it
[1:54:36] can look inside and see the fire inside
[1:54:38] that needs unlocked. Amen.
[1:54:41] But it's got to be honed and chiseled
[1:54:43] and sliced and diced. And it may be this
[1:54:47] big,
[1:54:49] but there's a whole lot of imperfections
[1:54:52] that that jeweler looks at and sees and
[1:54:54] goes, "Nope, that's got to go."
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; And that great big diamond can end up
[1:55:00] being a little itty bitty teensy thing.
[1:55:04] But the reason why is because it was
[1:55:07] just that little itty bitty teensy piece
[1:55:09] that was perfection of perfection.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; And so all of the they call them
[1:55:14] inclusions. All of you sisters know what
[1:55:16] I mean like amen.
[1:55:19] Right.
[1:55:21] All them inclusions had to because you
[1:55:23] want that perfect diamond.
[1:55:25] You want that fire to sparkle when he
[1:55:27] puts it on the hand.
[1:55:29] [Music]
[1:55:31] See, everything's got to be cut off. And
[1:55:35] I hope I hope you let the Lord cut some
[1:55:37] things off for you this morning
[1:55:40] because God's got a purpose in it. He
[1:55:43] He's He's not here to destroy us. He's
[1:55:46] here to love us. He's here to nurture us
[1:55:49] and make us his own. If we'll get on the
[1:55:52] potter's wheel, if we'll listen to his
[1:55:55] voice and hear his touch, can we do it
[1:55:57] this morning?
[1:56:00] Brother Brandham says, he says, "Listen,
[1:56:01] brother, you're never saved by any sign.
[1:56:05] You're never saved by any sensation.
[1:56:08] You are saved when you met God's
[1:56:10] condition of his word. And nothing else
[1:56:13] are you saved by." You say, "Brother
[1:56:15] Gabe, I the way you're saying is cutting
[1:56:17] me and I don't feel saved.
[1:56:20] Praise God.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; It's not by feelings.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Listen, you say, "Brother Gabe, you
[1:56:27] preaching on touch and feel." That's
[1:56:28] exactly right. But I'm not talking about
[1:56:31] this.
[1:56:33] I'm talking about those tenderhearted,
[1:56:36] inward yearning boughs of mercy
[1:56:40] because your feelings is going to you'll
[1:56:42] have you'll be on a mountaintop one day
[1:56:44] and a valley the next. And brother
[1:56:46] Benham tells us, he says, "You're saved
[1:56:48] because you met God's conditions."
[1:56:52] He says, "That's right. God's word is
[1:56:54] made a way. You're not saved because you
[1:56:56] feel like you're saved. I'm not saved
[1:56:58] because I feel like I'm saved. Cuz a lot
[1:57:00] of times I don't feel that way."
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Malachi 4.
[1:57:11] Yeah.
[1:57:13] And you young ones need to understand
[1:57:15] that cuz there's going to be valleys.
[1:57:18] There's going to be pitfalls. There's
[1:57:20] going to be backslidings. There's going
[1:57:21] to be downsittings. There's going to be
[1:57:23] uprisings.
[1:57:25] But through it all,
[1:57:27] you have to rest in the fact that you
[1:57:29] met God's requirements.
[1:57:32] You felt the prick of your heart. You
[1:57:34] heeded to it. You was baptized in the
[1:57:36] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:57:38] remission of sin. and you received the
[1:57:40] gift of the Holy Ghost cuz the promise
[1:57:43] was unto you
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; and you accepted it and you said, "Amen.
[1:57:50] That's mine."
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; And that puts you in the battle.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; That puts you on the forefront where
[1:57:58] every devil in hell, the devils ain't
[1:58:00] hanging out in the barrooms. They're
[1:58:02] sitting right outside those doors.
[1:58:04] They're trying to walk the aisles trying
[1:58:06] to get you to entertain a thought. All
[1:58:09] right. Amen.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; He says, "But I'm saved because God gave
[1:58:15] up the promise and I met God's
[1:58:18] conditions and upon God's holy word, I
[1:58:21] can defeat Satan seven days in a week
[1:58:24] and as many nights
[1:58:27] cuz it's God's word."
[1:58:32] Brother,
[1:58:34] sister,
[1:58:35] I don't say these things to be a smart
[1:58:37] alec. I say these things cuz I love you.
[1:58:41] I say these things cuz I want the
[1:58:43] unfailing realities in my life.
[1:58:46] There's something in this word
[1:58:51] that there there's something in this
[1:58:52] word
[1:58:54] that is that has touched my life in a
[1:58:57] way that I could never touch myself.
[1:59:01] [Music]
[1:59:02] And
[1:59:05] I want so bad
[1:59:08] to to see
[1:59:11] the joy of the Lord on each and every
[1:59:13] one of your faces.
[1:59:16] [Music]
[1:59:19] I don't want to see you downtrodden.
[1:59:23] I don't want to have to go down there
[1:59:25] and squeeze a amen out of you.
[1:59:28] I want that amen to come freely.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; I want you to say amen. Not because I
[1:59:33] said come on, please.
[1:59:36] I want you to say amen. Cuz you got the
[1:59:38] victory.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; Cuz the king is in the camp.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Cuz you're not Aimilec, but you're
[1:59:45] Abraham.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; You're seed of Abraham.
[1:59:49] And you're walking like you are seed of
[1:59:51] Abraham.
[1:59:53] Look, if you made wrongs, make them
[1:59:55] right.
[1:59:56] Get it under the blood. Humble yourself
[2:00:00] and watch God transform in ways that you
[2:00:03] never expected. Listen, young person,
[2:00:06] you struggling with lust. You know, you
[2:00:08] know, you know what? You know what Satan
[2:00:10] does? Satan will keep you bound because
[2:00:12] you won't confess it.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, husband, you struggling
[2:00:19] with lust. Go to your wife and confess
[2:00:21] it and see what happens.
[2:00:25] I promise you. I'm telling you, that's
[2:00:26] what I did. I had to humble myself. I
[2:00:30] had to humble myself and say, "Babe, I
[2:00:32] got a problem."
[2:00:34] And when I did, it unlocked something in
[2:00:36] me. Cuz Satan will make you shamed, and
[2:00:40] it'll make you hide under it. And you'll
[2:00:43] just be a Pharisee.
[2:00:45] You just be a Pharisee, a stuffed shirt,
[2:00:47] put on artificial put on. When in
[2:00:50] reality, all you got to do is humble
[2:00:51] yourself
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; cuz he's faithful and just to forgive.
[2:00:55] if you'll confess. Right? Remember
[2:00:58] remember that sister? She said, "I I
[2:01:00] didn't do I didn't do no wrong." He
[2:01:01] said, "Listen," she said, "I confessed
[2:01:02] that to God." Brother Bram said, "You
[2:01:04] didn't sin against God. You sinned
[2:01:06] against your husband."
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; And so, she had to go back. And when she
[2:01:12] went back to her husband and confessed,
[2:01:14] it unlocked something in both of them.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:18] See, it's when we struggle with
[2:01:20] something and we're so ashamed because
[2:01:22] we've been in this thing 30, 40, 50, 60
[2:01:25] years. How? Put whatever name on it you
[2:01:27] want, whatever number.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; And we think we ought to be farther
[2:01:31] along down the road than what we really
[2:01:33] are. And what it is is we got too much
[2:01:35] pride.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; We don't want to humble ourselves and
[2:01:38] say, "I'm a failure."
[2:01:43] But that's exactly remember cuz the
[2:01:45] sacrifices of God or a broken and
[2:01:49] contrite heart, a spirit.
[2:01:51] It's when we can humble ourselves and
[2:01:53] say, "God,"
[2:01:55] go to our family, go to our wife and
[2:01:57] say, "Listen, I messed up.
[2:02:01] I'm wrong.
[2:02:03] I betrayed you.
[2:02:06] I betrayed this gospel
[2:02:09] and I'm so
[2:02:11] sorry,
[2:02:16] brother. When you do that, the Holy
[2:02:19] Spirit steps in because that's remember
[2:02:23] he's a gentleman. He can only go so far
[2:02:25] because part of it lays in you. And we
[2:02:29] can blame everybody in the congregation,
[2:02:30] in a home, and parent. We listen, don't
[2:02:33] blame mom and dad. You're a grown man
[2:02:35] now.
[2:02:36] You got to put up. You got to put up.
[2:02:40] But if you if I'm telling you when you
[2:02:43] confess it brings liberty.
[2:02:45] It brings freedom. When we do something
[2:02:47] wrong or we wrong somebody. What what's
[2:02:49] in our mind? If I go I can't go tell
[2:02:51] he's going to do it. I can't go do it.
[2:02:56] But then when I humble myself and like
[2:02:58] look brother Sam I'm sorry. He's like
[2:03:00] brother Sam's like oh yeah brother Gabe
[2:03:02] no problem. I'm like, "Oh, okay. Thank
[2:03:04] you."
[2:03:06] Because in my mind,
[2:03:08] because what did Satan do? He worked
[2:03:11] something up and he made he made
[2:03:13] something that really wasn't there.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; And it's the same thing whenever we
[2:03:18] wrong somebody or we do. You break
[2:03:20] Listen, brothers. I'm telling you,
[2:03:22] listen. There's too many souls here.
[2:03:25] Lust is rampant
[2:03:28] in Lady Oia.
[2:03:31] And what Satan does is it keeps people
[2:03:33] bound because they won't confess.
[2:03:36] But if you confess, it'll lock something
[2:03:38] in you. It'll give you freedom and
[2:03:40] liberty like you never had because the
[2:03:42] Satan will have no place to hold you.
[2:03:47] Because whom he whom God has set free is
[2:03:50] free indeed.
[2:03:55] You That's why you're so bound up. You
[2:03:58] watch somebody that's bound up with lust
[2:04:00] and pornography and things, the first
[2:04:02] thing they do is they draw away and they
[2:04:04] isolate themselves.
[2:04:07] You know why? Cuz they don't want to
[2:04:09] touch.
[2:04:12] Because of shame,
[2:04:15] they draw away themselves and they say,
[2:04:18] "I'm
[2:04:19] I'm a failure. I'm miserable."
[2:04:24] But if you'll just
[2:04:27] just heed my words,
[2:04:30] it's not my words, it's God's words.
[2:04:33] If you'll confess he's faithful and just
[2:04:37] to forgive.
[2:04:40] And that forgiveness unlocks liberty,
[2:04:44] it unlocks freedom.
[2:04:46] And I'd encourage you this morning,
[2:04:48] friends,
[2:04:51] cuz brother Brandham says it'll defeat
[2:04:54] Satan anywhere. Seven days a week and as
[2:04:56] many nights.
[2:04:58] I don't want six days and nights and of
[2:05:00] victory.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; I want seven,
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; right? How many want seven days and
[2:05:10] seven nights of victory?
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together.
[2:05:14] And as we bow our heads,
[2:05:17] [Music]
[2:05:19] I'd encourage you, friend,
[2:05:21] my brother, my sister,
[2:05:26] if the waters is troubled
[2:05:29] like it was that day
[2:05:33] at the pool of Bethesda.
[2:05:38] And that man missed his opportunity.
[2:05:42] But you know there would come a time
[2:05:43] when
[2:05:46] a savior,
[2:05:49] a lonely man
[2:05:51] would walk through all those hundreds,
[2:05:53] maybe thousands of people cuz that man
[2:05:56] would have a predestinated moment that
[2:05:59] he'd hear from the master.
[2:06:02] And I'd encourage you this morning,
[2:06:04] brother, sister, if your waters has been
[2:06:08] troubled,
[2:06:10] would you
[2:06:13] maybe
[2:06:16] raise a hand,
[2:06:18] kneel at your seat,
[2:06:21] come to the altar?
[2:06:24] I I I don't I don't know
[2:06:27] what your need is.
[2:06:29] Is there a need to go to the al altar?
[2:06:32] Absolutely not. You God will meet you
[2:06:34] right there. That's that's just old
[2:06:36] Methodist tradition.
[2:06:39] But maybe you need to humble yourself
[2:06:40] and come to the altar.
[2:06:43] Maybe it's more than just the Methodist
[2:06:44] tradition. To you, it's something you
[2:06:46] got to do publicly.
[2:06:48] I don't know.
[2:06:50] Maybe you got to surrender at your seat
[2:06:52] and just say, "God, I
[2:06:55] whatever it is, I
[2:06:58] however the Holy Spirit is dealing with
[2:07:00] your heart, just don't push him away."
[2:07:07] when the Lord is talking to you, not
[2:07:10] brother Gab's voice, but that voice
[2:07:12] that's talking to you in your heart
[2:07:13] right now,
[2:07:15] that instance or that situation that's
[2:07:18] coming back over your mind. And
[2:07:21] that's the thing you need to deal with.
[2:07:23] It's not what Brother Gabe's saying, but
[2:07:25] it's what the Holy Spirit, it's it's
[2:07:27] that still small voice on the inside of
[2:07:29] you. Brother, sister,
[2:07:33] would you surrender to it today?
[2:07:39] In the quietness of this moment, would
[2:07:41] you would you just raise a hand?
[2:07:45] Would you bow your heart before him and
[2:07:47] say, "God, I I'm truly in need of you.
[2:07:53] [Music]
[2:07:56] Dad,
[2:07:59] could you humble yourself?
[2:08:03] Maybe
[2:08:04] grab your wife's hands and give it an
[2:08:08] extra squeeze and
[2:08:11] maybe squeezing in that Morris code of I
[2:08:13] love you.
[2:08:15] [Music]
[2:08:17] Sister dear, could you
[2:08:20] squeeze his hand and squeeze it two
[2:08:24] times and say, "I love you."
[2:08:28] [Music]
[2:08:29] Whatever your love language is, could
[2:08:31] you could you just talk to one another?
[2:08:35] And above all, could you talk to him?
[2:08:40] Let's each one talk to him.
[2:08:44] Heavenly Father,
[2:08:47] truly we
[2:08:49] are grateful.
[2:08:53] Well Lord, we were weward ones one day,
[2:08:57] lost
[2:08:59] and indifferent and undone.
[2:09:05] But you came by our way, Lord.
[2:09:08] [Music]
[2:09:12] You took us from amongst the sheep coat
[2:09:16] and you gave us a name like great men.
[2:09:20] And we're so thankful to be called by
[2:09:22] your holy name.
[2:09:28] Lord, in a world that's so indifferent
[2:09:30] and cold and dark,
[2:09:32] help us each one, each soul here to be a
[2:09:34] beacon of light.
[2:09:36] [Music]
[2:09:37] Lord, we want to be shining when you
[2:09:39] return.
[2:09:41] When you come back, you'll be looking
[2:09:43] for faith and we want it to be right
[2:09:46] here.
[2:09:48] [Music]
[2:09:51] I pray in Jesus name, Lord, for my
[2:09:53] brothers and sisters, the needs that's
[2:09:56] upon them, the cry of their heart. Lord,
[2:10:00] would you bring deliverance as only you
[2:10:02] can? Lord, would you restore
[2:10:06] men broken hearts, men broken lives?
[2:10:10] God, help us each one, Lord, to
[2:10:13] look past this world and
[2:10:17] help us yield our lives to you so that
[2:10:20] we could be your hands,
[2:10:23] that we could be your feet, that we
[2:10:26] could be your voice,
[2:10:29] that we could be that cry in the
[2:10:31] midnight hour,
[2:10:32] [Music]
[2:10:36] that Lord, that we would make time for
[2:10:38] you,
[2:10:39] that we
[2:10:40] As we are mindful of our love language
[2:10:44] to our family, might we be mindful of
[2:10:47] our love language to you?
[2:10:50] Giving you words of affirmation,
[2:10:53] Lord. Giving our gifts to you.
[2:10:57] Acts of service, Lord, that when we do
[2:10:59] something, no matter what it is, we do
[2:11:01] it as unto the Lord, even to the
[2:11:04] littlest of things.
[2:11:09] [Music]
[2:11:11] Lord that we as the scripture says kiss
[2:11:14] the son. Might we give you a kiss.
[2:11:21] You're the high priest that can be
[2:11:23] touched by the feeling of our
[2:11:24] infirmities. Help us go to those places
[2:11:27] where we share our infirmities with thee
[2:11:32] so that you may be touched.
[2:11:36] God, help us each one to get out of of
[2:11:40] our comfort zone
[2:11:42] [Music]
[2:11:44] and be your hands,
[2:11:47] be your eyes,
[2:11:50] be your ears,
[2:11:52] and above all be your heart.
[2:11:55] Lord, help us each one to be
[2:11:57] tenderhearted,
[2:11:59] tender to your touch,
[2:12:03] like we could be like the disciples of
[2:12:06] old, that the least little nod, we'd
[2:12:09] know what you wanted and we'd do exactly
[2:12:11] what you wanted.
[2:12:13] Let us be that sensitive,
[2:12:16] that sincere.
[2:12:19] That's my prayer for each one.
[2:12:23] We love you and we praise you.
[2:12:26] We commit all these things into your
[2:12:28] hands

[2:28:03] Jesus.
[2:28:08] There's just something
[2:28:12] about
[2:28:14] that name.
[2:28:20] He's my master,
[2:28:23] my savior,
[2:28:26] my Jesus.
[2:28:31] Like the fragrance
[2:28:33] [Music]
[2:28:35] after
[2:28:37] the rain.
[2:28:39] [Music]
[2:28:43] Jesus.
[2:28:46] Jesus.
[2:28:49] Jesus.
[2:28:52] [Music]
[2:28:53] Let all heaven
[2:28:56] and earth
[2:28:59] proclaim
[2:29:02] [Music]
[2:29:04] that kings
[2:29:08] and kingdoms
[2:29:10] will all
[2:29:13] pass away.
[2:29:16] But there's something
[2:29:19] about
[2:29:21] that day.
[2:29:24] [Music]
[2:29:41] [Music]
[2:29:55] Heat. Heat.
[2:29:59] [Music]
[2:30:01] Heat. Heat.
[2:30:04] [Music]
[2:30:27] Oh,
[2:30:30] [Music]
[2:30:44] are you
[2:30:47] [Music]
[2:30:51] Heat. Heat.
[2:30:58] [Music]
[2:31:10] [Laughter]
[2:31:15] [Music]
[2:32:02] Heat. Heat.
[2:32:05] [Music]
[2:32:23] [Music]
[2:32:26] Oh,
[2:32:28] [Music]
[2:32:39] [Music]
[2:32:53] heat.
[2:32:58] [Music]
[2:33:15] Hallelujah.
[2:33:16] [Music]
[2:33:49] [Music]
