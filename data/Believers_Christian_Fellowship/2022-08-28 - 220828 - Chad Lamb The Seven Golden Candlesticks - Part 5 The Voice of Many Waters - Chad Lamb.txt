you've promised to do in this time we love you father we ask you to break the bread of life to us in jesus christ's name we pray amen man god bless you all you're standing if you take your bibles we're going to go to revelation chapter 1 and we're going to continue with the seven golden candlesticks i believe this is part five if i'm not mistaken and um this would be kind of a continuation from wednesday wednesday we spoke about the the presence of the judge the judge amongst the bride and judge in our midst but now we want to talk about the judge through the bride amen and so that's what we'll look at this morning if the lord will help us in revelation chapter 1 verse 9 i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the aisle that is called patmos for the word of god for the testimony of jesus christ i was in the spirit on the lord's day and i heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet let's go over to verse 12. and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candle sticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool and as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined brass as if they burned in a furnace in his voice as the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength amen god bless you as you're seated amen we've been dealing quite a bit in this subject with the seven golden candlesticks and staying primarily in the verse 13 amen showing that when john heard a voice he turned to see the voice and he saw seven golden candlesticks and he saw one in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like unto the son of man and now we want to look at at the the attributes of christ in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and start talking about that as we go brother bam said in the patmos vision he says come to the ancient of days whose hair was white as wool and john turned and he saw one like the son of man standing in the midst of seven golden candle sticks with snow white hair the judge not girded around the waist but girded around the paps up here a judge with the sash of the judge over his shoulder he stood with a golden pure holy refined girdle that held his righteousness his cover he was covered all the way to the feet watched the seven-fold manifestations of his purpose as person and glory and brother bran was referring to there's seven attributes or seven uh characteristics of christ described here and we're going to go through those quickly but there's one that i really want to spend time on this morning but we know that he's coming in this dispensation we spoke about it last last service as a judge he's in between priest and in between king and he's his judge and i'd like to also remind you that brother branham said every age overlaps the previous age amen so brother branham showed us that god doesn't come down as a meat cleaver and cut something off and stun but one blends this way and blending that way and they overlap and it's very much a transitional phase it's a transition amen from church ages amen brother ben called it the ushering end of the millennium not exactly in the millennium yet but the ushering in the movement that will take us into millennium the movement is on the ushering in is going on so it's a transitional phase and we know that the judge amen is descending because in first thessalonians 4 it says he shall the lord himself shall descend with a shout with the voice of the archangel and the trump so we know that there's there's stages as he descends there's there's things that are being manifested him and the shout which is the message to gather aim in the elect the bride together the voice he said the same voice that raised lazarus from the dead amen and we're going to talk about that a bit today and the trump of god so we know that we're in the rapture cycle we know this is the rapture season and we know the culmination of the rapture season is the change of the body and the translation of the saints amen but we cannot say that the rapture has not begun because the rapture begins with the shout out so the trans the the translation is on the body change god is changing us more into the image of the word day by day until this outer man is coming subject to the life on the inside and being reigned in more and more to reflect the life of jesus christ amen so our soul changed amen we we've got the full revelation of the word so this is the resurrection of the bride amen resurrecting amen what she was meant to be in the beginning and died through the church ages when he preaches a restoration of the bride tree we see there's a restoration of that bride back to what she was originally intended to be only now with the full revelation of the sevenfold mystery of god to finish what she did not finish in the beginning amen so we're together so when we see him coming as the white wigged one amen amongst the seven golden candlesticks we realize we're in a transitional phase amen praise god because the the one thing that i want to discuss and talk about too is when we see him moving his judge and we see that the lamb took the book and and we understand that these things amen we we sometimes get caught up amen in the symbols of god and the transitions and we think that now there's no more possibility of anybody being saved amen but that's a foolish thing for me to preach because we know that the seals were open in 1963 and i was born in 1977 so if i believed that it was cut off like a meat cleaver when the lamb took the book and opened the seals amen through the ministry of the prophet in this end time then i would find myself cut off with no chance for mercy and no opportunity to be part of the bride amen but we know the lamb took the book he's the only one who can loose the seals the seals have been loosed the seals have been opened amen he tore open the seals and sent it down to a seventh church aged messenger that was on earth at that time and he turned around and gave it to the elect to the bride amen so we know the lamp taking the book we know we're in transition we know we've heard the shout we know the voice is ongoing we know we're in the rapture cycle we know this is the resurrection we know this is a transitional phase but as there is an ushering in of the millennium there will be a day when the millennium starts and we know when the rapture is beginning as he's gathering his elect together we know there'll be an end to the rapture amen in the final translation amen so praise be to god hold that in your minds now brother ben said in spiritual food in due season said and just started walking around but i put my shovel down he's he's in the at sunset mountain he's there camping with the brothers or on a hunting trip and the whirlwind's about to descend he said i just put my shovel down turned around took off my hat and here he come the glory of god falling in a whirlwind that tore the side of the mountain out like that and blasted and shook the place like that cut the top of the bushes out just about three or four five feet above my head went back up like a funnel like that it blasted again and here it come three times then when it left the third time brother banks come over and said that's what you was talking about i said yes he said what what was it i said god appears in whirlwinds i didn't know whether he wanted me to tell the people or not then i went on and prayed a little bit and then he told me i could tell them i said it's judgment striking the west coast look at her today look what happened a few hours after that alaska sunk and now the whole thing is going under we're entering into the judgment mercy has been spurned that true [Music] brother branham says we're entering into the judgment mercy has been spurned but brother branham never said amen mercy is over amen mercy's been spurned amen they rejected the opening of the seals now the judgment cycle has begun amen but will not be fully unleashed until until the bride is taken out of the way and the tribulation period sets in but he says we're entering into the judgment remember everything overlaps now he goes on to say but thanks be to god we got hidden food spiritual food that we're living on the goodness and mercy of the revelation of jesus christ in the last days vindicating himself among his people amen they went in elijah went in before the drought set in thank god for being in before the judgment sets in now is a time of coming out and going in getting out of these organizations and getting into christ coming out and going in time for all true believers then he was called and stayed in there remember he never left that brook until god called him and he's referring to a statement he made earlier in the same message and amen in that statement is this he says it several paragraphs before said remember he went into his secret place he's speaking of elijah by the plan of god by the call of god and the word of god elijah entered into a secret place by god's foreknowledge plan and the call upon his life and according to the word if that ain't the way we entered i don't know why why we i don't know why we get there and notice before the drought began elijah went into the place of secret of his living a very type of before the judgment starts to strike the earth the church is already called out the bride has already chosen and just waiting before the judgment strikes already waiting eating the food of god enjoying the blessings of god any man in his normal mind knows that we're headed straight we're right in the hour of judgment so brother bam shows that the the judgment cycle has begun there was a mighty prophet on the earth at the time that was told to pick up a rock and throw it in the air and he says see you have to do something to cause something and so when it come down it started a whirlwind and then the next day is when the whirlwind came down and blast three times over his head and he told him what it said his judgment striking the west coast and then just shortly after that it goes up and strikes alaska and alaska nearly sinks has a major earthquake amen and so brother telling us that the judgment is upon us the judgment we're entering into the judgment mercy has been spurned we're in a transitional phase but in the transitional phase before the drought come god had called elijah god had called elijah out into the wilderness by the brook of kidron and promised there to feed him amen with special food and sustain him throughout the drought and brother bam says that's what's happened to us amen that god has drawn us aside there's a there's a drought that hit the churches there's a drought spiritually that hit the world there's darkness upon the world gross darkness upon the people amen but we've been drawn aside to a secret place in the midst of the desert an oasis amen and the oasis is his word amen he has given his word that's why the prophet of god was told to store up the food amen not to go on the trip to overseas but stay and store up the food and he said the nicest prettiest vegetables i ever seen they were storing up and bringing them into the tabernacle and he says that's when we canceled the trip and just made tapes amen because he was storing up the food amen for the season of drought there was a place amen that god could draw his elect to and sustain them through the drought say thanks be to god amen in the message who do you say this is from 64 the prophet says day before i took a rock and throwed it up in the air and said thus saith the lord the hour is here judgments will start into the earth earthquakes and everything will be taking place and all the west coast will be shook and so forth look how perfect day by day everything just exactly the way he said so there's no question that we've entered into judgments that the earth is reeling under the judgments of god amen and these are only pre-trimmers amen these are only precursors to the to the tribulation that is coming upon the earth and of these we're seeing the frequency and intensity amen of pestilence of earthquakes of civil unrest of political distress a financial distress if we're seeing all that and it's building and building the whole world knows it's building there's not a question in anybody's mind that trouble is brewing something's building that the whole world is about ready to pop amen and we see that but there's a place that god has to sustain his elect there's an oasis in the desert there's a light that's shining brighter than ever before in the midst of darkness amen he says arise and shine for thy light has come amen praise be to god so i want to show the the whole point of this is showing we've entered into a judgment cycle mercy has been spurned the prophet's message has been rejected amen we're in a transitional phase and judgments have begin to roll upon the earth during that time we have an oasis we have a hiding place now we spoke we've been speaking about the first attribute of this judge that's amidst in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and it was his hair as white as wool we read this quote out of the rising of the sun it says well if you'll turn the picture like this and look you can probably see it from the audience it's christ see his eyes looking here just as perfect as it could be wearing the white wig of supreme deity and judge of all heavens and earth can you see his eyes nose his mouth just turn the picture from this the way they had it this way the way it's supposed to be can you see it he is supreme judge there is none other but him and that is a perfect identification again a vindication that this message is the truth this is the truth it's true and making him not a third person but the only person remember wednesday we spoke that brother bannon when he saw that capstone in the in the form of a a of a pyramid a capstone in the sky the cloud amen he knew it was seven angels and he knew it was the seven angels of the seven church ages that come and picked him up and he was received into them amen into them who had the mystery of the of what was on the white rock amen the mystery that was with inside themselves amen and in the capstone amen and he knew that and he knew it was the fulfillment of his vision amen but it was months later that he was looking at the picture and told to turn it to the right when he turned it to the right he recognized that this was the head of christ this was the capstone is the headship of christ coming back upon the body amen and he's coming back as judge as the white wigged one amen and he has supreme authority and supreme judge of all heavens and earth so we looked at that but if we go back to our scripture and revelations chapter one verse 14 begins the description his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire amen this is a description of christ the judge but remember where he's at he's in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and this is what brother brahm said i'm just going to grab excerpts of these and i'm just going to give a brief description because like i said before there's one that i want to spend time on in the patmos vision from the church age book he said those fiery flaming eyes of the judge are even now recording the lives of all flesh amen the eyes amen represent something that can be seen amen uh they represent an illumination understanding intelligence and the ability to see so this is a judge who can see but his vision is perfect and piercing amen his eyes are a flame of fire he said the and i'll repeat this those fiery flaming eyes of the judge are even now recording the lives of all flesh running to and fro throughout the earth there is nothing he does not know he knows the desires of the heart and what each one intends to do there is nothing hidden that shall not be revealed for all things are naked before him with whom we have to do think of it he knows even now what you are thinking no one will escape those flaming eyes they pierce to the heart and he knows the motive behind our actions and not just our actions the actions of the whole world because he is the judge amen the next attribute we see here is verse 15 in his feet like in defined brass as if they had been burned in a furnace his feet like fine brass amen and and we know that the prophecy says that he will tread upon his enemies and put his enemies under his feet and brass in the scriptures is a type of judgment remember the serpent on the pole of brass amen the the brass altar amen where the lamb is sacrificed and many many animals are sacrificed and burnt because it's sin being judged the serpent on the pole with sin from the garden being judged amen so brass is a type of judgment and judgments on his feet because he will put everything under his feet amen everything that is wicked everything that is hybrid everything that amen is not of god will be put under his feet amen let's look at revelation 19. i want to look at this in a couple scriptures revelation 19. revelation 19 is christ coming on a white horse in the armies of heaven following behind him but i want to read uh starting in verse 15 revelation 19 verse 15. and out of his mouth goes sharp i'm sorry out of his mouth go a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and lord of lords he will stamp out the residue he will he will put everything under his feet there will be nothing above him but everything will be under him in judgment amen we're told in in genesis chapter 3 when god is pronouncing his judgment amen after he comes into the garden of eden after the fall he begins to judge the serpent he says and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and i will put enmity between thee and the woman in between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel here we have a prophecy showing that the serpent and everything that the serpent represents amen all of satan's works and all of satan's kingdom amen will be crushed his head will the head will be put under the foot amen so the highest of the of the serpent order will be put under the king of kings amen so that's one prophecy but let's go to romans 16. and look at another so we know the seed of the woman is christ but when we go to romans chapter 16 we want to look at verse 20. romans 16 and 20 said and the god of peace shall bruce satan under your feet shortly see this judge was in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and those feet of brass he says that that that he will bruise your head but you will bruise his heel that you're going to be bruised in the head under his heel amen but then he comes along and paul says and the god of peace shall brew satan under your feet shortly showing that the bride of christ is included in the prophecy of christ amen because it's christ she is him she is part of him she come from his side she he is the word made flesh in his day she is the word made flesh in her day she is a part of god a part of christ amen a part of the revelation of the word and she is lumped together in the prophecy he will put the serpent under his feet amen god will put bruce satan under your feet shortly showing that they're tied together so this judge is in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks which represents the church through seven church ages amen let's go back to revelation chapter one revelation chapter one in second part of verse 15 in his voice is the sound of many waters i'm going to come back to that i'm not going to go to that one yet i want to end on that verse 16 and he had in his right hand seven stars in his right hand seven stars and we know that the seven stars are the seven uh church age messengers and the ephesians church age out of the church age book he says there he is with the seven stars in his right hand the right hand our arm signifies the power and authority of god psalms 44 3 for they got not the land in possession by their own sword neither did their arms save them but the right hand and thine arm and the light of thy countenance because thou hates favor unto them and thy right hand of power are seven stars who according to revelation 1 20 are the seven church messengers this signifies that the very power and authority of god are behind his messengers to every age they go forth in the fire and power of the holy ghost with the word so being in the right hand they signify that they have the authority and power of jesus christ those seven messengers but brother branham is not going to limit it only to the seven messengers because in the in the church age book and the patmos vision he says as each age pulled away from god his faithful messenger turned that age back to the word their strength was from the lord or they never could have stemmed the tide they were safe in his care for nothing could pluck them out of his hand and neither could anything separate them from the love of god let it be sickness peril nakedness famine sword life or death they were truly yielded to him and kept by his omnipotence they were not concerned about the persecution that came their way pain and derision was but caused to give glory to god that they were counted worthy to suffer for him and in thankfulness for his salvation they burned with the light of his life and reflected his love patience meekness temperance gentleness faithfulness and god backed them up with wonders signs miracles they were accused of being fanatics and holy rollers they were denounced by organizations and held in mockery but they kept true to the word now he's speaking this of the seven church age messengers that are in his right hand but he's saying they could not be plucked out of his hand and who else cannot be plucked out of his hand you and i cannot be plucked out of his hand and he goes on to say and this comfort is not for the seven church age messengers only every true believer is in the hand of god and can draw from his love and power amen and receive the full benefit of all that god is to the believer what god gives the messenger and how he blesses and uses the messenger is an example to all believers of his goodness and care to all members of his body although there was seven stars in his hand which represented the seven lights amen to the seven church ages the seven angels and the seven dispensations what he shows through the messenger life becomes an example to all just like brother branham amen his life the word coming to manifestation and his flesh became an example to all of us it became the wave sheath amen that showed this is full harvest maturity take courage what happened here will happen to you also amen so what he did to the messengers was an example of what he's doing for you and i we're not the messengers but we're holding up that light amen and we're in his hand just like the messengers were we're in his hand we're securing his hand and can draw from the power of that strong arm not our power his power amen you see how these attributes they apply to christ but they apply to his bride because they are one amen let's keep going and first revelation revelations one 16 he had his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and in the church age book again he says hebrews 4 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and morrow and is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart it is the word it is it is performing where unto it was sent for it the word is full of power it is the same spirit that was in jesus the word that is present again in the church in the last age as a last sign trying to heed the people off from judgment for they for they that reject him the word are now already come into judgment crucifying him afresh hebrews 6 6 if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame now paul said that the word came in power as well as voice the word preach actually demonstrates itself like a flaming cutting sword it went to the conscience of men and like a surgeon's knife it cut out the disease and set the captives free what did that the preaching of the word amen the sword amen it came in and in it and it it cut in the conscience of man and like a surgical knife it cut out the disease and set the captives free what was it it was the word amen he's gone everywhere those early believers went they went preaching the gospel word and god confirmed the word with signs following the sick were healed devils were cast out they spoke in new tongues that was the word in action that word has never failed in the mouths of believing christians and in this last age it is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride oh little flock you little minority hold on to the word fill your mouth and heart with it and someday god will give you the kingdom amen that that sword that was coming out of his mouth was not only supposed to come out of his mouth but it's supposed to come out of our mouth too amen it is supposed to be the word that we speak the word that we preach the word that we testify with it's the word that does the work amen because psychology will never do it emotionalism will never do it but the word can go into the conscience of man and cut like a surgeon's knife and cut the disease that's laying there out amen and the man who's doing the preaching and the person who's doing the testifying often doesn't even know the work that god is doing amen with his mighty sword but is there something laying in the conscience of a man of another person amen the only thing you can do for them is give them the word and the word amen will do the work and cut out the disease amen there's so much amen that has been given to us the answer is in our hands amen god has given us the word amen he sent a mighty prophet to vindicate that word and that word is here amen been given to us and handed to us for us to use so we don't need to use reasoning we don't need to use uh intellectualism we don't need to use schools of theology we don't need to use emotionalism we don't you use psychological techniques what we need to take and use is the word because the word is what works and the word has never lost its power in true believing christians it's not the diminished one i owe to amen and brother beam said let it come from your mouth and your heart amen let the word be coming out of the mouth of the bride now don't think for a minute that i think we should not have compassion or sympathy or feeling amen we should have all kinds of feeling when somebody's in trouble somebody's in need and somebody's coming to us love them have compassion have feeling have emotion for them amen care for them but that care and love and emotion won't fix anything if there's no word present the word is what does the work. but we should love everyone look on them with compassion considering ourselves amen let's go back to our scripture in revelation verse 16. now we're at the bottom of the verse and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength the church age book the prophet of god says there it is again the sun shineth out and all its strength oh the strength of the son of god shining in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks there he stands the judge the one who suffered and died for us he took the wrath of divine judgment upon himself he tread the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of god alone as we have already stated to the center his voices as the sound of the cataract or the surf pounding in the waves of death upon the rocky shores but to the saint his voice is as the sound of the sweetly singing brook as you lie at rest i want you to catch this first we'll see he's talking about his son shineth in his strength amen because you know brother bran was was also speaking the church age book that the city that new jerusalem has no need of sun or moon amen because the glory of god shineth upon it and the lamb is the light thereof he's the illumination he's the light he's in full glory he in this day he's shining forth as the sun in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks hey our light has come amen that's why brother ben said shalom little bride good morning and the sun is up amen it's a new day the bright and shining light is here the sun is shining and all its power and its glory where in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks in the midst of the bride at the end time the sun has risen where it has risen it's arisen upon you and i amen that's our light our light isn't anything else nothing else that man can produce but he's our light and that light is supposed to shine through the city because the city is made of stones of jasper as clear as crystal amen so they shine with crystal and light reflecting the light of jesus christ into the world and that's what we're supposed to do he's in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks he's in the city he's in her and shining his light amen that's why brother ben was talking about that little seed amen that's laying there under the ground under the dirt amen and the seed will lay there and that bright warm sun will hit it and he said and all the dirt around it will say oh that sun's hot it's uncomfortable and the seed says oh that's what i'm waiting for that's what i'm looking for that's what i want and it'll bring the seed to life amen some don't want the light some need the light to come to life amen and there's seeds laying out there i believe there's still seeds laying out there that needs the full power of the hot light amen to bring them there's dirt there that'll say that's uncomfortable for me i can't tolerate the heat's too much for me but there's seeds laying under the dirt that says that's what i've been waiting for that's what i've been looking for that's what i need to come to life so his countenance was as the son but as brother branham goes to explain this then he gets into the the back into the voice of god and i'll read this again because it's it's important as we go next it says as we have stated to the center his voice is as the sound of the cataract or the surf pounding in the waves of death upon the rocky shore so to the center that's what his voice is like troublesome and fearful and powerful and in a rage and in a torrent then he says but to the saint see it's the same voice the same word but depending on who's hearing it they hear two different things one the center is the sound of the cataract or the surf pounding in the waves of death upon the rocky shores but to the saint his voice is at the sound of the sweetly singing brook as you lie at rest satisfied in christ the question is what do you hear what do you hear it says shining upon us with his warming rays of love he says fear not i am he which was which is which is to come i am the almighty beside me there is no other i am the alpha and omega that all of it he's the lily of the valley the bright and morning star he's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul yes that great day is ready to break and the son of righteousness will arise with healing in his wings i'm so glad we can sing the sun is up amen now i want to go back and this is where i would have spent the rest of the service in the bottom of verse 15. we skipped over his voice as the sound of many waters and this is what brother bram says in the church age book he says now now what do the waters represent here in revelation 17 15 the waters which thou sawest are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues his voice was as the sound of multitudes speaking who is this this is christ where is he in the midst of seven golden candlesticks what image is he in he's in the image of judge amen so here the judge has a voice of many waters amen in the many waters represent multitudes speaking not just one but multitude speaking it's one voice it's one person it's one word spoken through a multitude of voices amen [Music] what is it it's the judgment for these are the voices of the multitudes of witnesses who by the holy spirit all through the ages have testified to christ and preached his gospel it will be the voice of every man rising in judgment against the sinner who would not take warning the voices of the seven messengers will be heard loud and clear those faithful preachers who preach the saving power of jesus who preached water baptism in jesus name who preached the infilling and power of the holy ghost who stood with the word more than they stood with their own lives all of them were the voice of jesus christ by the holy ghost down through the ages this is the judge and the judge has the voice of many waters it's the multitudes through the ages that stood with the word and this is the judgment then he quotes a scripture out of john 17 20 says neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word this is what i want to talk about now is judgment in the bride but now judgment through the bride let's turn together to john 15. and really the thing that i want to labor on the most is the right attitude the right attitude as we teach this this is what i'm laboring on the most john 15 22 jesus said in john 15 22 if i had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin but now they have no cloak for their sin jesus said if it wasn't that i had come and that i had spoken the word and i had demonstrated the life if i had not come and spoken to them then they had no sin but now they have no cloak there's no covering for their sin their sin has been exposed not by calling somebody up and saying you're a sinner i'm exposing your sin no but by him coming and living the life and speaking the word now their sin is exposed so the exposure amen the exposure is not and this is this is the attitude that i want us to come up with it's not that we are here judging the world i have no desire to judge the world jesus told us judge not amen so i have no desire to judge anyone i want everybody to have a free pass if god asks me today i want to give everybody mercy and everybody a free pass and everybody come with me and let's dwell together in the new heavens and new earth there's nothing in me that wants to condemn anybody because if i condemn them i must also be condemned because the only way that i'm where i'm at is by the grace of god not by my actions not by my deeds so why do i want to condemn people for actions and deeds when there's no action or deed that's brought me here it's the grace of god that's brought me here so it was up to me i would extend it to everybody so we're not here saying you're in you're out you're this you're that because you didn't listen to me you're this and because of this you're that i have no desire for that i don't want anything to do with that but the reality is when you're here accepting the word and lining up to it amen you have taken the cloak away for the sin of those who refuse the word it's your life that's bringing judgment it's your it's your submission to the word amen it's it's it's the it's the surrender that you have to god and the holy ghost living through your life and the the way you carry yourself the way your family is structured the way you submit to god and the way you treat other people the way you speak the word of god amen it is bringing a condemnation to everyone who will speak evil against it and hate it and that's what jesus said if i had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin but now they have no cloak for their sin he goes i'm going to skip ahead to something here there's a part that i want to i want to bring in let's go to matthew chapter 12. i didn't think i wanted to get to this now but i want to get to this now matthew chapter 12. let's look at this together in matthew 12 i'd like to begin with verse 38. matthew 12 and 38 then certain of the scribes and of the pharisees answered saying master we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the prophet jonas for us jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth then listen what he says next the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of jonas and behold a greater than jonas is here verse 42 the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shalt condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here jesus is telling them that the the the people of nineveh that repented under the preaching of jonas will raise with that present generation and condemn them because they repented at the preaching of jonas but they refused the ministry of jesus christ and he said a greater than jonas is here then he referred to the the queen of sheba he said that queen of the south amen he says she shall rise in the judgment and condemn this generation amen because she came from the uttermost parts of the earth and brother banham would tell us that she went through great lengths to get to solomon amen she really sacrificed a great deal she had to go through a lot and travel a great distance and she had to leave her religion and had to leave her priest at the objection of her priest and and she went amen to to go to hear the wisdom of solomon and she brother jesus said you come from the uttermost parts of the earth so she traveled and he said traveling through that desert where there was bands of robbers and all kinds of threats and traveled on camel for months amen just to hear a man who had the wisdom of god and the understanding of god and he says behold a greater than solomon is here he was right in their myth and they were rejecting him and didn't want him but here come a woman that would sell out that would give up that would take amen all kinds of contrary talk and people trying to hold her back but would still persevere just to get to solomon but there was a greater than solomon there being rejected in that day and he said the queen of the south shall rise with this generation and condemn it in the judgment listen i don't think this is just purely me i don't think the queen of sheba is going to stand up there at the judgment and say you you you you i condemn you i pass judgment on you i condemn you all she has to do is stand there and all god has to do is is show her life and it condemns all who stood right in the face of a greater than solomon and rejected his wisdom that's why the saints will judge the earth i i personally don't want any part of saying you my neighbor who didn't listen to me you're gone and this and that and i don't want anything to do with that amen i i don't want to do that i don't want to bring judgment or condemnation upon anybody the queen of sheba didn't travel across the desert to hear the wisdom of solomon to condemn an entire generation that wasn't the point the point was she was moved in her heart she knew there was somebody that had the wisdom of god and she had to get to that person to hear whether these things be true or not it was her love for god and her love for truth that moved her but that action became condemnation to all those who would reject it wasn't her motive to judge anybody amen those who repented amen at the preaching of jonas they didn't repent so that they could bring condemnation against a generation they repented because they believed the preaching of jonas and they wanted to be right with god amen so the the a judgmental judgmental critical attitude has no place in the bride of jesus christ we don't take pleasure in judgment we don't take pleasure in condemnation amen we're just here to serve god with all our hearts because we can't help ourselves because of what he's placed within us we serve god we surrender to god we give our lives to god we obey his word not to bring condemnation not to judge the world amen and when you see somebody amen who god has been so good to raise up with the religious pride and say how dare you how can you and why do you do this and why do you do that god is going to judge you you have this and you're this and you're that i'm telling you that's a judgmental critical religious attitude amen that the queen of sheba didn't have and that those in nineveh didn't have they had a repentant humble attitude and submission to the word and truth when you start to see that criticalness criticizing listen people are unbelievers they don't know any better is the world a mess it's a mess are people in darkness they're in darkness are their lives vile and ungodly they're violent ungodly but they were raised up in that and if there's no seed of god on the inside and that they've never seen the light where would you be if you were raised the way they were raised in the flesh they were in and had no seed of god to bring you out amen to me the attitude is so important we serve god because god has drawn us to himself we serve god because we can't help ourselves some of us have given up jobs some have moved locations some of us have made great sacrifices but not one of us did it to condemn another human being at least i hope not and i hope not one of us will take pride in the fact well i sold everything and i moved and i and i and i you didn't do anything if god didn't help you there wasn't a thing in this world that you could do to save yourself or help yourself or keep the word of god by yourself that whole attitude has got to go amen [Music] and just say god just use me for whatever your purpose is do i believe the bride in this end time will be a condemnation in the judgment against this whole generation i believe it with all my heart but not because she stands up and says you treated me this way and i told you and you didn't listen to me i don't believe that's going to be the white throne judgment friends i believe it's the very fact that there was a people on this earth that received the word of god would line up to the word of god would surrender to the word of god and manifest it and live it that becomes the condemnation that becomes the judgment amen so do we serve god with all of our hearts we serve god but not to put somebody down and we don't take pride in where we are but we recognize but for the grace of god there go i but for the grace of god i would be maybe worse off than the picture than i'm looking at so i say god help us to have the right attitude so there is a voice of many waters is that right and it's the voice of judgment but listen to what the prophet of god says in the church age book have you ever thought how terrifying it is to a man drifting helplessly toward a cataract think now that roar as he approaches his sure and certain doom and just exactly like that is coming the day of judgment when the roar of multitudes of voices condemns you for not having paid heed er it was too late take heed this very hour for at this moment your thoughts are being recorded in heaven there your thoughts speak louder than your words like the pharisee who the pharisee who claimed so much with his mouth but not listening to the lord his heart became corrupt and evil until it was too late even now this could be your last call to hear the word and receive it unto eternal life it will be too late when you approach the roar of the many voices of judgment and doom but have you ever noticed how sweet and relaxing the sound of water can be see brother rams flipping both sides on one side the voice of many waters is a terrible voice it's a voice of a a pending doom judgment dashed upon the rocks is going over the falls to the center it's a voice of doom but to others it has a whole different feeling to it altogether he said have you ever noticed how sweet and relaxing the sound of water can be i like to fish and i like to find a spot where the water is whispering and ripples i can just lie back and hear a speaking peace and joy and contentment to my heart how glad i am to be anchored in the haven of rest where the voice of the lord speaks peace as his word of the waters of separation hath declared how thankful we should be to hear his voice of love and care and guidance and protection and someday we will hear that same sweet voice speak not in judgment but unwelcome to us whose sins have been remitted by his blood whose lives have been spirit-filled and whose walk was in the word what could be more precious than to hear the multitudes of welcoming voices what voice is the voice of many waters down through the ages how great to hear the welcoming voices and be surrounded by those multitudes who have been how have believed unto eternal life oh there is nothing like it i pray that you will hear his voice and harden out your heart but receive him as your king oh if you would only see it it was the waters that destroyed the world but it was the same waters that saved noah and also saved the whole earth for noah listen to his voice the voice of his servants as it calls to repentance and to life listen it's the voice of judgment it's the voice of many waters but to those who will heed that voice it becomes the voice of the sweet melodious voice of a rippling of water over brooks speaking contentment and peace and love to the heart because brother branham said the same waters that destroyed the earth saved noah amen the same waters that destroyed everybody that was on the earth were the same waters that lifted noah up and moved him above the judgment oh praise god amen that means that the waters that are coming from our mouth amen the sound of many waters the word that's coming from the bride is not only for condemnation and judgment but it is also for salvation it is also a sweet sound in somebody's ears amen not everybody will hear it multitudes may not listen to it amen to that one person who finds that voice of many waters and hears it singing to him sweetly like a rippling brook amen for them that will be a voice of love that will be a voice of salvation that'll be a voice of life it'll be the sound of the river of life that's what our attitude should be we're we're not here to sound the cataracts we're here to sound sweet love joy peace the love of god the mercy of god and the grace of god that's extended to this world we're speaking peace we're speaking love we're speaking joy we're speaking contentment we're speaking a communion with god that should be always our attitude and always our approach and to somebody else they may hear it as the as as terrible churning waters of judgment but that's not our intent and giving it that was not jesus intent and living the life and giving the word he came to bring life not death amen let's look at luke luke chapter 6. luke chapter 6. and verse 37 luke 6 and 37 judge not and you shall not be judged contem condemn not and you shall not be condemned forgive and you shall be forgiven i want to live by this scripture right here all my judgmental critical thoughts i want god to take away i want to forgive everyone and let god judge who needs judged i don't want to judge anybody if my life and the words that i speak that are true if that judges them it's not me that's judging them i don't want to judge them it's their refusal to hear the word of god and refusing the life of god that'll judge him but it's not me that'll judge them amen because i will forgive everyone so that i can be forgiven i will not condemn so that i'm not condemned because listen i've said before you take if god lifts his hand off any of us for a day we will be screaming and begging for him to bring him back the thoughts of wickedness that go through your mind the lust of the flesh that would consume you if god lifted his hand off of you for a day you would be terrorized and screaming for mercy for god to put his hand back upon us i don't want to judge it's god's grace that holds me here i don't want to condemn i would be condemned because it's god's grace that holds me here let's go to matthew chapter 7. i said before i don't need to judge any man and say whether he's in or out or whether he'll make it or not god will take care of that it's not my i don't want the responsibility i would hate to have that responsibility let god sort those things out matthew chapter 7 verse 1 it says judge not that you be not judged for with what judgment you judge you shall be judged and with what measure you meet it shall be measured to you again oh these are terrifying words to me these are terrifying words if you take a judgmental critical attitude that's going to come right back to you someday you just wait and see shall be measured to you again and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye but consider us not the beam that is in thine own eye or how wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull out the moat out of that eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye when i read this scripture i remember i remember with embarrassment my zealous days of first coming to the message when i was right and everybody else was wrong did anybody else have those days i hope i'm not the only person in the room i now knew the truth i now heard the word i now was right and i know what's wrong with the rest of the world and everybody else is wrong and i'm walking around with a beam in my eye trying to poke pluck motes out of everybody else's eye and then later in life when god begins to reveal your immaturity to you he reveals your pride to you he reveals an arrogant attitude to you he reveals how you had things wrong and how you had things not lined up in your life and he's constantly molding us and we constantly have things dropping off of our life and we look back and i don't know about you but i get that little shiver that goes up my spine when i'm embarrassed thinking oh i can't believe i did that i can't believe i said that well if that is true then could it be true today good to be something i'm missing in my own life where something in my life is not lining exactly to the will of god and i'm going around trying to fix everybody else and i'm the one still in need of fixing it's better to say god help me god help us all god help him god help me god help all of us amen we need help amen go to john chapter 3. john chapter 3 16. for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved so what was god's motive condemnation or salvation his motive was salvation verse 18 he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are rotten god so god never sent his son into the earth to condemn the world but that through him the world might be saved man condemns himself by not receiving god's light man because his deeds are evil he condemns the light he rejects the light and when he rejects the light he himself is rejected and he man has condemned himself by refusing god amen it wasn't even god condemning man man condemned himself by refusing the light amen let's go to john chapter 12. john chapter 12 verse 44. john 12 and 44 jesus cried and said he that believeth on me believeth not on me but on him that sent me and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me says i am come a light unto the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness and if any man hear my words and believe not i judge him not for i come not to judge the world but to save the world he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him the words that i have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day for i have not spoken of myself but the father which sent me he gave me a commandment what i should say and what i should speak and i know that his commandment is life everlasting whatsoever i speak therefore even as the father said unto unto me so i speak the commandment that was given to jesus that he gave out was life everlasting he was there giving life the jews in that day didn't want life they rejected life they rejected the light they rejected the life they rejected the word and he says i won't judge you but there'll be another judge you the words that i speak they shall judge you basically you have judged yourself by refusing this word that came from my father you refused the father's word and now you put yourself in judgment and the same thing applies to us we don't have our own word we have his word we're only speaking his word that's why the bride amen in revelation chapter 10 amen 8-11 she is to take the book and eat the book and prophesy again she's not to have her own prophecy she's supposed to take the prophecy that's been given and prophesy again and the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of jesus christ so you see now that that it's not our word amen it's the father's word this was in the back part of god's mind he brought it down through a channel delivered to us and we're living according to his word we're speaking according to his word and now when that's rejected amen i don't judge you i don't i mean there was a time that i didn't think the message was right amen god had to quicken it inside of me so if you don't understand it i'm not going to judge you amen this is light if you continue to refuse the light amen you judge yourself but i don't want to judge you you've condemned yourself i don't condemn you amen in the end time amen god will raise up the bride and the end time amen in the judgment and she shall condemn this generation how will she condemn this generation because she kept the word she spoke the word she lived the word she preached the word amen she dressed like a lady amen he acted like a gentleman and then they lived before the people the way christ would live in your flesh and it becomes a sweet sound to those who love the word and it becomes destruction and judgment to those who hate the word but for us let's be like the queen of sheba just excited to hear his voice just happy to know the truth just willing to give up willing to sacrifice willing to travel willing to to risk danger to risk ridicule to risk persecution just to come to a greater than solomon amen let's be like those of nineveh who are happy to repent amen under the preaching of this prophet and surrender our lives and line up amen but but let's not be amen like the pharisee who goes into the temple and says i thank god that i fast twice a day i thank god this and i thank god i'm not like this publican and he was worse than the public and he was worse off than the publican because he but he thought because he could keep some traditional teaching and he could keep some rudiments of the scripture and he could have some obedience that he was better off he was like the rich young ruler who thought he should make it in based off his ability to live the life his parents raised him to live amen and thought he would be okay not realizing that in his heart there was a problem and he had to make a full surrender and he refused and he condemned himself let's not be like the pharisee but let's be like the queen of sheba i just got to hear the truth let's be like those are nineveh i just gotta line up to the word i just gotta repent under this preaching amen whatever the consequences in fallout are i'm not responsible for that that's not even my vision that's not even my purpose amen my purpose is just to repent under this preaching just to travel and hear this wisdom that come from solomon [Music] in that life surrendered that life lived will rise up in a generation and condemn a whole generation but not because we ever wanted to condemn a generation if there is a generation condemned they're condemned because they refused the light because they didn't love it and they didn't want it not because we did anything amen sometimes i i think sometimes people handle the word in a nasty arrogant way and the nasty hateful arrogant way of condemning and cutting and and you this and you that and and and say things about other churches and other uh denominations and nominal believers and and criticize and cut down and speak just harsh and evil and and i think why you handle the word so rough and when they reject what you're saying you say they rejected the word sometimes they haven't rejected the word sometimes they just rejected you and your attitude needed to be rejected they were right in rejecting you even though you were speaking true words amen you're not speaking it the way christ would speak it you're not speaking with the intent and purpose of the word amen and so sometimes i think we've we've passed righteous judgment when all that they've rejected was our hypocrisy and our arrogant attitude and then our self-righteousness is what was rejected not the word so i said god help me live the life that i never in myself cause somebody to refuse your word because of my actions because i don't believe they'll be condemned if it's my fault amen i said god just let me in simplicity and humility love you and your word more than anything else in this world and would you by your grace give me your spirit to help me to live this life and would you live it through me as i surrender to you daily i die daily i keep under my body amen i keep under my body unless i preach to others i should be a cast away i bring this flesh into subjection to that word amen because i love god and i want to surrender to the word and whatever you do with that that's up to you but i'm not looking forward to a day of judgment when i get to stand up and say you out you over here you're you remember what you said to me remember the conversation we had in the lunchroom 2018. i don't think that's what the queen of sheba is going to be doing i don't think that's what the men of nineveh are going to be doing i don't even think that's what the lord's going to be doing i think by the time we get to the white throne judgment and ev the secret of everybody's heart is before them i don't think there's going to be any questions there's not going to be any rebuttals there's not going to be any disagreements everybody will know let's go to acts chapter 13. acts chapter 13 and verse 46. then paul and barnabas wax bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles paul never judged them unworthy of everlasting life paul said you judged yourself unworthy of everlasting life because jesus says the commandment of my father is life everlasting so the word i speak to you there is spirit and life and he gave that word to paul and paul was now giving out the word of the father and as he gave it out that word was life when they rejected that word they judged themselves unworthy of everlasting life it wasn't paul passing judgment it was the people passing judgment brother bram said in in the message revelation chapter four when he's preaching like we said before between the church ages before he gets to the seals after he's finished preaching the first three chapters of revelation he starts in 1961 preaching revelation chapter 4. and in part three of this message he said now the voice of the throne noticed the throne before the throne with seven stars the voice of the stars voices you see there was more in revelation 4 here of five we find out and out of the throne proceeded lightnings thunders and voices not one voice voices plural what was it god speaking to the church reflecting himself through the seven spirits when the true anointed of god speaks it is the voice of god to reject it is to remove the candlestick voices the voice of the seven church ages over here in the corner the is speaking with thunder and lightning he says now everybody can't be a preacher but you got a voice if you can't preach the people a sermon if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of god that'll bring reproach to them who reject it you hear that you live your sermon and it's the voice of god that'll bring reproach to them that reject it you don't have to reject anybody listen if somebody continually rejects you you don't have to reject them if somebody continually speaks evil of you you don't have to speak evil of them amen look at brother branham for our example he was ridiculed by other preachers he was mocked he was lied about he was spoke evil against but he never returned the favor he didn't condemn he didn't judge amen any time he passed a condemning condemning statement he made it a broad statement that would cover everybody in this category but he wasn't calling out you who could you who resisted me you who said this you're this and you're that amen brother branham when they would draw him out of the circle he would draw his circle bigger than include him back in he would forgive people who hadn't even apologized to him and he told us to do the same thing so when a man has done you wrong i mean really done wrong he said just forget about it just forgive him just move on amen i am not in the judging condemning business amen i want to be retired from that business i've taken that sword too many times and it leads nowhere but bitterness and corruption in my own heart i want to be say god have mercy god forgive god whatever whatever you can do for him do for him i'm it's in your hands not mine i've had to pray some hard prayers before going through some really difficult times when people would say things that were not true and people would uh you know try to defame your character and you go through some dark hours and bitterness tries to creep in your heart but you have to keep praying until you can forgive from your heart because if you cannot forgive not intellectually but from your heart amen you can forgive from your head because the bible says forgive if you don't forgive neither will i forgive so you can say intellectually i'm going to forgive them that's not going to work it says unless you can forgive from your heart amen you've got to pray until god can root that bitterness out of your heart and plug it out until you can forgive somebody who's done you wrong not say i forgive them but forgive them until you can get on your face and i've had to pray sometimes so i got to the place where i could get down and say god i don't want anything bad to happen to this brother what they did to me was completely wrong what they did was against the word but don't judge them for my sake if it's for me i forgive them and i ask you to forgive them too i don't hold them accountable i don't hold them guilty and i do not want you to judge them for what they did to me and when you can pray that way amen you know that that bitterness is leaving your heart when you can pray god to bless and forgive and look over somebody's sin when they've really done you wrong but that's exactly what jesus was able to do nailed to a cross he was able to look down against those that mocked him laughed at him spit upon him beat him wagged their heads and mocked him as a as a king and as a prophet amen and he said father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing stephen was able to do the same thing amen in the face of an angry crowd who hated him for what he believed wanted to kill him because he spoke the truth amen they were taking up stones to stone him and he said father lay not this sin to their charge that's true forgiveness [Music] when you say i forgive somebody but do they got it coming that's not forgiveness you say i forgive them but they better watch out god's going to get them true forgiveness is when you can stand in the gap for them and say god when you can recognize no matter how wrong they've done you that you could do that to somebody else if god didn't help you that i've spoke evil about people before i've gossiped about people before i've said things that painted people in a bad light i'm just as wicked as any other human being as wicked it's the grace of god in my life how can i condemn another human being till we can get to be a place of mercy love forgiveness and stand like jesus and say god forgive them they don't know what they're doing they don't mean it lord let them go that's what jesus did for his wife or is what brother ben did for his wife he's out washing his car she slammed the door in his face she said something short with him slammed the door in his face and brother was washing the car and said god forgive her she didn't mean it she don't mean that lord see god had to pass a judgment anyways and there was a tumor that began to grow but not because brother branham wanted it and not because god brother ben was hoping that god would correct his wife he was interceding for and said god she didn't mean it forgive her lord she's under so much stress she stands and he becomes the intercessor for the one who's wronged him that's the real attitude friends that's the real approach amen i don't want to be a judge i want to be an intercessor i don't want to be a condemner i want to be a forgiver and i know that god will do whatever god must do and i know that my life if god through through me through the grace that he's put in my life allows me to line to the word and live it and preach it true i know that that life will be condemnation judgment to others but not because i want it to be that way but because it has to be that way what i want is god to forgive everybody i think that's the right spirit that's the right approach so is this the hour of judgment yes if judgments begin upon the earth yes has mercy been spurned yes but i pray there's some mercy left as long as i'm here upon this earth i pray that my life can get can sing a sweet rippling sound of a brook to somebody i don't want my life to be judgment and condemnation to everyone i wanted to bring life to somebody he said brother brahms going on in the same quote he said the voice of god [Music] that'll bring reproach to them who reject it he said let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of god that'll bring reproach to them who reject it they say no one could put a finger on his or her life they're sweet living if there ever was a man of god it's that man or that woman see live your sermons don't try to preach them if you're not if you're not called to be a preacher you get all mixed up anyhow and messed up and you'll get people tangled up and you won't know well you'll ruin them and yourself too just live your sermon the preacher is called to preach his and live it too if you can't live it then you stop preaching it but you're supposed to live your sermon all right there was voices oh how we need in jeffersonville thousands of lived voices the thunder of god thundering out and sweetness listen to this thunder of god listen to how it thunders out and sweetness holiness purity undefiled lives walking around in the earth today without a blemish yes sir real christians that's thunder against the enemy we think of the thunder of god it's got to be loud it's got to be firm it's got to be hard but he said the thunder that thunders against the enemy is a life of sweetness holiness purity undefiled lives without a blemish that's the thunder against the enemy if you want to destroy satan's kingdom quit yelling at him and start living this word if we want to hurt the devil stop insulting him when calling him names if we want to hurt the devil let's give our lives completely to this word and let christ have his way in each of our lives and live this message not debating it not screaming about it not hammering it but let's live this message and let it thunder against the devil amen yes sir real christians that's the thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as can be and move right on oh my that throws them away that's the thunder that shakes the devil how many want to thunder against the devil how many want to shake the devil oh you're going to do it in sweetness and humility and purity and an undefiled life in submission to god in quietness and in humility it's not because you're going to be standing up screaming on a street corner insulting the devil and calling everybody who passes by you know devil bait but what will shake his kingdom is that life this message came to produce the life of christ in a bride that's the purpose of the message and i want the purpose of the message to take root in my life and i want my life to match that message amen let's go to 2nd thessalonians chapter 2. second thessalonians chapter two thessalonians 2 and verse 7. for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way this word he who now letteth the word letteth means to hold fast to possess to hold back to detain to retain to restrain to hinder the course of progress that which hinders antichrist from making his appearance so there's a there is a force that is hindering or letting or holding back brother branham speaks of this verse in the first seal it says for the mystery of iniquity doth already work deceivers you see deceiving the people often to something see only he god that letteth will let until he the church christ the bride be taken out of the way let's read that together let's follow along in ii thessalonians 7. i want you to read it in your bible go to the part it says only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way and let's let brother branham interpret these two he's to us he says only he god who letteth will let until he the church christ the bride be taken out of the way what a statement my after the bride is taken away then this man of sin will reveal himself she the true bride of christ has been elected out of every church age so now he that letteth will let till he be taken out of the way god is holding something back amen as long as christ in the bride is here something's being restrained something's being hindered something's being held back and limited amen but when when christ and the bride depart amen then something is unleashed amen so our very presence here with christ in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks in this day is actually hindering the progress of antichrist to fully launching his whole plan and in all of his deeds and i say praise god amen if it takes me remaining here to hold that back for one more person to make it in then i'm no longer going to to be contrary and angry and upset that i'm still here let me stay here and let me shine the light and let me thunder against the devil as long as there's a restraint on the antichrist system that's when they asked they asked brother branham and questions in answers in 64 said after the bride is raptured will any of the foolish virgins be saved or will they all be lost it says no see everything will be finished for the gentile church when the bride is taken from the earth the spirit of god leaves the earth he that's filthy is filthy still he that's righteous is righteous still he that's holy is holy still in other words the sanctuary became smokey the attorney stands to plead the case christ leaves the sanctuary his days of media turns over the rapture comes he leaves from the sanctuary goes forth takes the book of redemption claims everything he redeemed there's no more mediatorial work how many understand that i got into one of the seals yeah the seals i believe that was that christ comes forth to claim his mediator work now just a minute will the foolish virgin be saved no whatever happens happens now after that time she's in the state so what he's saying is in this transition period when judgment has come amen when he's come to claim his inheritance he's in the claiming ministry now and he's come as the white wigged one in this interim as long as the bride is still here amen the spirit of god is still present amen and whatever happens now whatever choices are made in the foolish virgin now amen once the bride leaves the spirit of god leaves the earth and then it's set it's fixed and it's not changing so that means while the bride is here there is still a chance not just for the elect but also for the foolish virgin and also for them that would do good to the bride and i said god let my life shine such a lie that somebody will find entrance into that great kingdom at the end of time amen let me stand here as an intercessor let me stand here as an open door to the ark amen not judging everybody's gone we're the only ones that got it everybody's failed it's just me but oh god if i'm one of them let my life have an effect on this one and that one and this one and that one while your spirit remains while mercy's available while the door is open let something be done because when the bride leaves there's no more chance for any gentile to change their status what they are is what they are and it's fixed but i remember saying christ is the mystery of god revealed he said that's christ in the church today taking his wife back see the threefold mystery now god manifested in christ christ manifested in the church all together to bring back the original adam and eve again man and woman which are one made out of the same blood the same spirit everything else the church is the blood of christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood that's the baptism of the holy ghost that baptizes us into his body that recognizes only his body his flesh his word the spirit of god is in his bride christ is here will will your life condemn and judge a multitude of people yes but oh how i long to be there in that day when i know that my life also brought salvation to somebody condemnation and judgment god will take care of that those things must be it has to be he has to purge and rid his kingdom of everything that doesn't love the word but he'll take care of that i'm not going to stand there joyful amen watching multitudes go off into oblivion into the lake of fire that's not my desire it's not what i want what i'm watching for at the white throne judgment is that one that i know can receive a reward amen that one that i know that can receive life that one that i know that made it amen because i held a testimony because i shined the life and to them amen they didn't hate it they didn't reject it they may not have understood it they may not have been able to receive it but they didn't hate it and they didn't reject it praise god brother ben said christ the mystery of god revealed again he says but when the current is flowing freely the word of god it expresses itself the works that i do shall you do also and in the last days shall come to pass behold i send to you elijah the prophet you shall learn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and then there there would be a time come forth when he would express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church having the preeminence in his church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and bridegroom anointed by why accepting what eve turned down and adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see anointed with the word what eve turned down he comes back and we accept see how the hybrid condition again just exactly what he'd done he done eve he told eve don't you do this and don't you do that and you can do this and that and satan said oh you know but she turned around and listened to him but the even the last day is not going to do it because she's predestinated not too it's not our willpower and our strength but it's his predestination it's his will power and his strength but the eve in the last day is not going to do it because she's predestinated not to yes sir god's going to do it he knows he'll have it what in the world can we take pride in he'll do it he'll have it it's his will he said church would be there without spot or wrinkle she is going to stand there in the splendor of him his word made manifest shall be a token to the world she'll be a nix he stopped he was going to say example she'll be an ex she'll be something to the world that the world can look at and say well the rest of the world might say oh she's a holy roller she's a second cousin she don't belong to our group i know that that's a good thing see she belongs to this group up here but in the end time this bride in the full glow of the light of the seven ages and the seven golden candlesticks with the judge in her midst she will be a token to the world an example that they can look at some will speak evil against it some will reject it but not all will and in the day of judgment some will receive life because of the word that they respected coming through your life brother brahma said back in the church age book he said there he stands one like unto the son of man as the jewel is beautified by the mounting of the ring so he is glorified in the midst of the churches it is the lord's day for john sees him standing not as a priest but as the coming judge the golden girdle is no longer girded around the waist where the priest must wear it as he ministers to god in the holiest place but it is now around his shoulders for he is not now the priest but the judge and as the judge as the jewel is beautified by the mounting of the ring so he is glorified in the midst of the churches this is where he wants to display himself in the end time he wants to come one with the end time bride and he wants to manifest himself in her until the two become one and is it a judgment it's a judgment will it condemn the world it is absolutely condemning the world but i pray and hope it's not condemning the whole world i hope some are coming to salvation is it judgment time yes are judgments in the earth yes are the people being judged by how they received the word in bright form yes but oh may some find it a reward on the day of judgment for how they receive the word in bride form and if there's any elect seed out there may the light that's shining from this bride from this word in this day made manifest may it strike the seed and though the dirt rejects it and finds it uncomfortable may the seed find it warming and powerful bringing life to the seed may our life and the light shining through us and the word coming through us may it produce that result on the seed of god so they can spring to life praise god it's judgment time but i'm not interested in judging anybody it's a judgment cycle it's a judgment season but i'm not interested in judging anyone i want i want somebody to find mercy i want as long as as i'm here as part of the bride present on earth and the holy ghost is here and the bride is the blood by the spirit i want there to be an opportunity for somebody i want to live the life not the judge i want to live the life to give life i want to live the life to share life i don't want to live the life to condemn to death our motivation and our purpose in everything is for life the word came for life the word was restored for life he is a tree of life she is a tree of life restored back to him the bride tree is a tree of life light that's illuminating this age is the life of men light is life the water is life it's all about life and you and i are here for life the world will be judged because they didn't want the life they'll be judged because they rejected the life but we are here for life and let our life be lived to impart eternal life to somebody else may our life be lived to shine the light without compromise because if a light is lit and hit under a bushel basket what good does it do man if we live in compromised water we withholding from others if we live and speak in a compromising way how will others find their way to light how will life come forth no we must stand in the full glory and splendor of him by full obedience to his word we must let the light shine in its full magnitude in power compromise withholds life let's live an uncompromised undefiled life by the holy ghost and let that light bring life to somebody and if somebody is judged it's because they judged themselves because they didn't want the light not because i judged them but because they judged themselves by the time we get to the white throne judgment everything's already finished the deeds are done everybody's already in one category another amen the white throne judgment is where the reward is given out for the deeds done amen it's already sorted out people have already made the decision in their lifetime they've already met the two trees in the garden they've already made their choice and then it's just going to be the movement of categories and however it works i don't know how to work in that day but the judgment is going on now the sentencing will take place in the future and i say god let me live for life not live for judgment but let me live for life and part of that is judgment it is a judging time but i'm focused as the queen of sheba was on getting to the greater than solomon my focus is as the nineveh were to repent under the preaching of this prophet and line up to his word that's what i want what god uses that for and in judgment and in mercy is up to him but my motivation is to repent my motivation is to sell everything and obtain this pearl of great price praise god let's all stand so in the hour of judgment i think it's important to have the right attitude because the right attitude can bring life and the wrong attitude doesn't bring anything to anyone but condemnation and musicians if you'll make your way up let's pray lord jesus we thank you father then in the hour of trouble that's upon the earth god i think of my own life after the prophet through the stone in the air after he declared that mercy has been spurned and were entering into judgment many years after that i was born after the time of judgment was upon the earth after the earth was in a desert condition spiritually speaking after darkness and gross darkness are on the people after all of that i was born and lived 20 something years and after all of that time you still knew how to find me lord you still brought a life with a light in my path and i could see the light and i could hear the words that were spoken and it became a light that brought life to a seed within me and if you can do that for me you could do it for somebody else lord it's not too late i pray it's not too late lord i i don't want it to be too late i ask god what you've done for me so many years after we've entered to a judgment cycle lord it's been many years since but may there still be life available to people may there still be a light shining and a pure word preached that'll give life to multitudes of people god let our life be the right reflection let it be the right light let us surrender more than we've ever surrendered before for god it's your mercy it's your grace lord it's your goodness to us that's brought us here and god shine through us the light and may somebody find that light and in that light may they find life everlasting we love you father we thank you for being amongst your people may you find welcome amongst us lord may you find us carrying you in our hearts and your word and our hearts with the right attitude with the right approach towards people with the right approach towards life may we reflect your character may we reflect your attitude may we reflect you in every way forgive us where we've been critical forgive us where we've been judgmental lord purges of those things wash it out of us lord and make us lord to carry your very nature the nature of the word the nature of the seed may it take preeminence over every part of our lives over our thinking over our speech over our emotions over our reactions may your word take precedent may you have absolute authority in our lives we love you lord i pray god as long as the doors open may you be seeking souls souls that might live on beyond time whether in the city or out of the city as long as they have life be on time we could have fellowship together i pray god that you would do what you can do that your word as a mighty power as a mighty light can go out and find everyone and place everyone in their position for it's all in your hands and you know what is right and you know what is righteous and we submit to your leadership in all things have your way with us o god and use us in this end time to finish your purpose amongst the gentiles in jesus christ's name we pray amen and god bless you brother john shine through me lord shine through me let the light from the lighthouse shine through me o shine through me o shine through me let the light of the lighthouse shine through me o live through [Music] through me lord me let the light from the lighthouse live through me you know and in the great judgments of god god is going to bring every circumstance to his word so that there is no excuse on the day of judgment somebody will say you know but god i was handicapped and i i couldn't serve you he'll have somebody in his bride who was handicapped and served but god i didn't live near a church i couldn't drive two hours so have somebody who will drive two hours to hear the word to show that that's no excuse you know somebody says you know if you knew what religious abuse i came from he'll have somebody in the bride who's come through religious abuse and surrender to the word there'll be no excuse on that day he said well i was neglected of my father if somebody was neglected of the father i was abused by my mother he'll have somebody who was abused by their mother [Music] just like you have somebody that will traverse the sands and deserts and robbers to come see solomon to stand as a testimony against a generation he'll have somebody who's went through persecution rejection abuse fallen pastors and and all kinds of uh troubles and and all kinds of violence and and rejection and neglect he'll let all of that come to show that my word was enough that it would work and there's no excuse on that day nobody will have an excuse and we didn't drive two hours for that reason and we didn't we didn't overcome by god's grace uh rejection in complexes and and neglect and abuse we did it because we loved him and we found his grace sufficient for us we did it because we were so happy that there was a word that can deliver us we came to him because he was our only option and our only source we gave him our life because for us it was a great exchange my life for eternal life my life for his it was an easy exchange for us but that very act amen will be condemnation for somebody who tries to use that same excuse for why they couldn't serve god and we never meant it for that we just lived the life he called us to we just lived grateful we lived for him we surrendered him because we had to because he put something in us that would live that way and i said let the word work in our lives and let it shine the light and everybody else just love them love them if i'm going to be guilty for anything i want to be guilty for being too kind too loving too generous and too merciful i don't want to be guilty of being too judgmental too critical if i'm going to make a mistake i want to make a mistake in being too kind and too loving and too generous god will sort everything out and make everything right on that day i don't have to sort it out today i don't have to figure it out i don't have to figure out the destination of all men and by the actions they commit where they fit in god will figure all that out i just want to love everybody because that person who's vile today could be my brother tomorrow that person who is living ungodly amen tomorrow could be sitting in the pew next to me the one that i hugged her neck every service i don't want to treat him bad i don't want to speak evil god will sort all that out my advice is let's love everybody let's do whatever we can for anybody brother bam said if i can do anything to make the life of another human being better that's what i want to do he spent himself to pray for sick people who would reject his ministry but he had the gift in his life and he was willing to give it out jesus's gift he never used his gift to deliver himself in the temptation in the wilderness he never used his gift or his power to deliver himself from calvary but he always used his gift and his power on others when they were coming to arrest him to destroy his lies to murder him to unjustly amen peter drew out a sword and cut off the ear of the high priest servant and jesus had the power to deliver himself he had the power to smite him dead at one of his words they all fell over he had all power but he didn't use his power for him he used his power to heal the servant of the high priest brother branham stood in a pulpit so weak he could hardly stand but he had compassion on the people and prayed for them he used his gift for others not on himself brother abraham said living for others is looking heaven in the face there's an eternal quality to living for somebody else's benefit for somebody else's life or somebody else's betterment i say god help me to follow the example of the prophet of this age and help me to follow example of our lord and the saints through time amen i'm not what i used to be sure not what i ought to be but i thank god i'm not what i used to be and he has brought us this far i believe with all my heart if we catch this word the right way with the right spirit that we will emulate that life we're not where we want to be we're not where we ought to be but we're not where we used to be and thank god the word that brought me from there to here i believe that word will take me from here to living that life of christ and that's my goal in this life to surrender all and to manifest that life not just for myself but for the benefit of others as well man god bless you all let's sing again brother jesus has changed my whole life and if anybody you just who i am oh tell them that i am and where there was hate [Music] and i'm walking with jesus i'm a child of the king and it seek me because i am [Music] [Music] and jesus has changed my whole life and if anybody asks you just who i am you can tell them oh that i am redeemed [Music] oh i'll tell up his favor i'll tell love his his goodness to me for he purchased my redemption with his precious blood o and from sin oh he said me free [Music] oh jesus has changed my whole life and if anybody asks you oh just who i am you can tell them that i am breathing i am redeemed [Music] i'm born with oh jesus has changed my whole life and if anybody asks you just who i am oh tell them that i am reading i will serve thee because i love [Music] me [Music] was nothing until you found me oh you have [Music] and broken pieces [Music] [Music] is [Music] me oh i will serve thee because [Music] to me oh i was nothing before you found me oh you [Music] and broken jesus [Music] [Music] is [Music] and the more that i surrender the more that i release my cares the more you take control and the more that i can humble myself the more you lift me [Music] i live the [Music] take control and the more that i can humble [Music] myself lord i love you more the more the more that i surrender the light [Music] the more you take control the more that i can humble myself [Music] i love you [Music]
