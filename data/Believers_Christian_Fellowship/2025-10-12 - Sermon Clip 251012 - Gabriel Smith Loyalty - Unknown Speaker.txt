========================================

Listen what brother Bham says. I imagine some of his enemies walk around say father of nation how many children do you have don't make any difference how I have now I'm a father of nation that's all how do you know God said so that sell it so along went Abraham you see being so loyal more loyal Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who? Wait a minute. I think I think every one of us need to take that quote and put it on our refrigerator. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I want you to think of somebody that's loyal to you because remember our brains are the ones that need rewired. &gt;&gt; And so Abraham, only a prophet could say this. So Abraham more loyal. Now, if somebody's loyal to you, what are you going to do to them? You're going to patty cake them around &gt;&gt; because why? You don't want to ruin that loyalty. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; You don't want to test &gt;&gt; that loyalty, &gt;&gt; because that would be cruel because they're so loyal to me, &gt;&gt; right? But that's not how God works. &gt;&gt; And that's not how God works with seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Right sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whom you are. &gt;&gt; And so the more loyal you are. &gt;&gt; Guess what you get. What the? Brother Gabe, can you read the next paragraph? Maybe by chance are you splicing takes, brother? No. No. But remember, you are designed to be seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; That's how God built you. &gt;&gt; And the more loyal you are is not the more cupcake road you're going to have. &gt;&gt; But more loyal, being so loyal, more loyal, more testing. So he brought him right back. Now remember when God has counted you worthy when you have a test now he says now don't fail this to get this when you have a trial or a test it shows the grace of God has found you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You found favor. What? &gt;&gt; Isn't that Isn't that contrary to our thinking?
