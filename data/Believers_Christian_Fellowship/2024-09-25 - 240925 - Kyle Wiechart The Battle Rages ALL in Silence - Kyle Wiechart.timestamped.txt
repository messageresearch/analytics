[9:13] he'll bring it to pass everything he
[9:15] promised he would do God bless you all I
[9:18] would like you to turn in your Bibles
[9:20] directly I sometimes you get out here
[9:23] and I talk a little bit but now I just
[9:25] just kind of want to go to write to the
[9:26] inspiration if that's okay I uh it's
[9:29] been on my mind pretty heavily
[9:31] throughout the day and I'd like to just
[9:33] go to it and I appreciate brother John
[9:35] calling me out a few minutes early gives
[9:37] me a little bit more time on a Wednesday
[9:39] night and and get the kids to bed
[9:41] hopefully for school tomorrow and so I
[9:44] told Brother John brother you don't have
[9:45] to wait long for me as soon as you feel
[9:47] the anointing you think it's time to
[9:48] call me call me I don't care if it's 10
[9:50] minutes from after you start singing you
[9:52] just when you feel it ready call me so
[9:55] God bless you all we certainly keeping
[9:58] brother Tommy in prayer prayer and
[10:00] brother Matt in prayer here in the
[10:02] prayer requests and trusting God to
[10:04] watch over them both and bring them back
[10:05] here safely soon and obviously um just
[10:09] uh keeping brother Chad in prayer as
[10:11] well he's having a wonderful time him
[10:12] and sister Angie and keep praying for
[10:14] the services to come up this weekend so
[10:18] God bless you okay let's just go right
[10:20] to the word if you don't mind we turn in
[10:22] the Bibles to Romans 85 Romans 85
[10:40] just say
[10:41] amen
[10:42] amen the word of God says for they that
[10:45] are after The Flesh do mind the things
[10:48] of the flesh but they that are after the
[10:51] spirit the things of the spirit for to
[10:54] be carnally minded is death but to be
[10:58] spiritually minded is life and peace
[11:02] amen because the carnal mind is enemity
[11:05] against God for it is not subject to the
[11:08] law of God neither indeed can be so then
[11:12] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[11:15] God but ye are not in the flesh but in
[11:19] the spirit if so be that the spirit of
[11:23] God dwell in you now if any man have not
[11:27] the spirit of Christ he is none of his
[11:30] and if Christ be in you the body is dead
[11:34] because of sin but the spirit is life
[11:37] because of
[11:39] righteousness one more scripture
[11:42] verse I have a PowerPoint so you could
[11:44] just look up from here very simple we
[11:48] all could say this one by heart even the
[11:50] Sunday school kids could but I want to
[11:53] labor on it
[11:54] tonight Mark 12:30 for Thou shalt love
[11:58] the Lord Lord thy God with all thy heart
[12:03] and with all thy soul and with all thy
[12:07] mind and with all thy strength amen
[12:13] let's just bow our heads for a word of
[12:15] prayer Heavenly Father we're so thankful
[12:18] Lord that you gave us these
[12:19] opportunities Lord not that we just get
[12:21] to come to church but Lord we get to
[12:23] come to a believing Church Lord many
[12:26] will go to churches but how many will
[12:28] have the truth and know that you're in
[12:30] their presence father how blessed of a
[12:33] people we truly are Lord to know you're
[12:35] here and to know we are feeding on the
[12:37] body word of Jesus Christ and father
[12:40] that word that we're feeding on is
[12:41] changing us day by day so Lord I just
[12:45] pray that you would come and do only
[12:47] that which you can do take the
[12:49] insufficiency and the inability of an
[12:51] ignorant man Lord and anoint my mind and
[12:54] anoint my lips to just say those things
[12:56] that you'd once said father I pray Lord
[12:59] that you would drive away any evil
[13:01] spirit any doubt any fear any worry any
[13:05] distress Lord those things that Grieve
[13:07] Your Spirit Away father and bring a
[13:09] spirit of peace and a warm welcome in
[13:11] our hearts Lord to receive your word
[13:14] Lord we commit this evening into your
[13:15] hands and I commit the word the things
[13:17] that are said don't let me say anything
[13:19] wrong let me just say what you once said
[13:21] and Lord will you re Bless The Hears the
[13:24] ears that hear the word may we receive
[13:26] it with gladness in Jesus name
[13:30] amen you may be seated this
[13:37] evening so
[13:40] tonight i' like to share something
[13:43] that's been on my mind and uh how many
[13:46] were blessed by Sunday
[13:48] service how many were cut deep amen yeah
[13:52] the word of God knows how to do that
[13:54] it's sharp like a two-edged sword and it
[13:56] knows how to cut in ways we didn't know
[13:58] but we are been cut but if God Cuts he
[14:01] cuts for a purpose and I believe he cuts
[14:03] sometimes so he can bind you up the
[14:05] right way sometimes he's just got to cut
[14:07] off the things that cannot stand to
[14:09] continue to walk with him and I'm just
[14:11] thankful that he knows how to do that
[14:13] and tonight I'd like to take some
[14:15] thought that's been on my mind even
[14:17] before the service that brother Chad had
[14:19] preached something that brother Brenham
[14:20] had said and I have a title obviously as
[14:23] you can see the battle rages all in
[14:27] silence and it's a bit a play on words
[14:30] but I hope it'll make sense as we go on
[14:33] through tonight's service and I do have
[14:35] a lot of quotes and I have a lot of
[14:37] scriptures um but just relax it's a
[14:39] Wednesday night so it'll have your
[14:41] attention something that you can look at
[14:43] tonight but we'll just be feeding on the
[14:45] word I like to start here with what
[14:48] brother banham said in the greatest
[14:49] battle ever fought he said oh we're
[14:51] going to jump to this I had my slides
[14:53] backwards this great first battle that
[14:56] was ever fought began in heaven when
[14:58] Michael and his angel angs fought
[14:59] against Lucifer and his angels it first
[15:02] started the first battle was in heaven
[15:04] so sin did not originate on Earth it
[15:06] originated in heaven and then it was
[15:08] thrown down from heaven cast out of
[15:11] Heaven to the Earth and it fell on human
[15:13] beings then the battle from Angels
[15:17] became human battles and Satan came to
[15:20] destroy God's creation what God had
[15:22] created to be for himself he had Satan
[15:26] come to destroy this and that was his
[15:29] purpose that was his purpose was to
[15:31] destroy it then the battle began here on
[15:34] Earth and begin in us and it has been
[15:37] raging ever
[15:40] since when the great battle started on
[15:43] Earth there had to be a mutual meeting
[15:45] place there had to be a place selected
[15:47] for the battle to begin and for the
[15:49] battle to rage and that battle Grand
[15:52] began in the human mind there is where
[15:55] the battle starts the human mind was
[15:58] chosen for the place of the battle where
[16:01] it was begun and that is because that
[16:05] decisions are made in the
[16:10] mind
[16:12] so last Sunday driving back from
[16:15] Junction City and I love how God
[16:18] works my wife and I were driving not
[16:20] every time do we have the whole family
[16:22] together in a car and could listen to a
[16:23] sermon together and we had about an hour
[16:26] we were leaving Columbus and I just
[16:27] picked one sermon I was thinking well
[16:29] something we can finish it's about an
[16:31] hour long it's the meanest man in Santa
[16:33] Santa Maria Santa Santa Ana something
[16:35] like that and you know in that story
[16:38] brother Brenham talks about the footwash
[16:40] flunky and he talks about the meanest
[16:42] man there who would leave our Lord
[16:45] disrespected and unwelcomed in his own
[16:47] home and it goes so clearly into a drama
[16:51] that I am not one to drama I don't know
[16:53] how to D dramatize anything I'm not good
[16:56] at that but there was something brother
[16:58] B said in there that just stopped me
[17:00] when he said it he starts to talk about
[17:03] the agony that this woman is going
[17:05] through could she do it how could she do
[17:07] it he would know where I got the money
[17:09] oh I can't do it but I can't let him sit
[17:10] there unwelcomed he can't he can't do it
[17:13] he's my Lord but I can't go do this if I
[17:16] do this I sell everything I have you
[17:18] know a great battle was raging in the
[17:21] mind of this
[17:23] woman and brother brandham goes on to
[17:25] say as she was wrestling this out in her
[17:28] mind she eventually commits herself to
[17:30] it buys the alabaster box goes to his
[17:32] feet breaks it tears can't look can't
[17:35] move just starts dumping it crying
[17:38] pouring it all out kissing his feet and
[17:40] washing it with his
[17:42] hair and brother banon made the comment
[17:45] that the Lord did not
[17:47] move or make a sound if he would have
[17:50] moved if he would have even just barely
[17:53] moved she would have taken off and I got
[17:57] to thinking about that as I was driving
[17:58] home and I even called brother Chad this
[18:00] week after he preached watering the cels
[18:03] camels I said you know I was listening
[18:05] to meanest man and when she was breaking
[18:08] that Alabaster Box the Lord was standing
[18:10] in
[18:11] silence complete
[18:13] silence not going to make a move going
[18:16] to see what she would do and I began to
[18:19] think in my mind as she was there you
[18:21] know nobody told her to go do
[18:25] that he wasn't asking her to do it she
[18:29] didn't have uh the disciples off to the
[18:31] side saying you need to do the Lord a
[18:34] service oh will you go do this oh do you
[18:37] know if you do this he'll forgive your
[18:39] sins she had none of that she had a
[18:42] battle in her mind what would she
[18:46] do and I'm so convinced that this brings
[18:48] it right up to present tense I stepped
[18:52] into her
[18:53] shoes what would you
[18:55] do would you sell all and give him a
[18:58] service like
[19:00] that and I began to think about oh my
[19:03] goodness you know we are all in the same
[19:05] position right
[19:08] now she believed that he was her Lord he
[19:12] said oh my Lord is sitting there with
[19:14] unwashed feet so in her Mar in her heart
[19:17] her mind she believed him to be
[19:20] Lord she even had a desire to do
[19:23] something for
[19:25] him she even had in her heart faith
[19:29] right she believed in her soul there was
[19:31] a faith to believe this is the
[19:33] master but now she was going to have to
[19:36] do something with all her strength that
[19:39] would go bypassing all aspects of
[19:42] understanding in her human mind she was
[19:44] going to do something
[19:47] radical
[19:48] unbelievable she was going to give
[19:50] everything she had and serve the Lord
[19:56] amen and I as I've been doing on that
[20:00] love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[20:03] with all thy soul with all thy mind and
[20:07] with all your strength
[20:10] amen many people will give him their
[20:13] mind yes and God will use what you give
[20:17] him you give him your mind you want to
[20:20] know more about God and the mysteries of
[20:23] God you know what God will give it to
[20:24] you
[20:26] yes some people want to just believe God
[20:29] from their soul you know brother bham
[20:31] said there's two Senses at work in the
[20:33] soul two senses only faith and unbelief
[20:38] but you know you can move mountains and
[20:40] still go to
[20:41] hell though I have all faith that I
[20:44] could move mountains and did not Jesus
[20:46] say though they did many mighty works we
[20:49] did many mighty works in your name did
[20:50] not we lay hands on the sick and they
[20:52] recovered did not we do this didn't we
[20:53] do that they had Faith they wouldn't do
[20:56] it without it he said depart from from
[20:58] you workers of iniquity I don't know
[21:00] you and then some people have a desire
[21:03] to serve
[21:04] God but they give him none of their
[21:08] strength they give their strength to
[21:10] pursue careers they give their strength
[21:12] to pursue whatever desire they
[21:16] have and God's not going to force you to
[21:19] do
[21:21] anything you make your own decisions you
[21:24] make your own choice whether or not you
[21:26] will give him all yes
[21:29] that's your choice because remember God
[21:32] wants to be loved and you cannot force
[21:36] that
[21:36] one he can create every circumstance he
[21:39] can he can reveal himself to you his
[21:41] heart's been revealed to you all that he
[21:43] is has been revealed to you but then now
[21:46] your time to make a
[21:52] decision the Bible says now I'm going to
[21:55] break these down and we're going to
[21:57] slide through these
[21:59] in Psalms 37 Delight thyself also in the
[22:02] Lord and He will give Thee the desires
[22:05] of thy heart so from your heart comes
[22:08] your
[22:10] desires Paul said in Romans Brethren my
[22:13] heart's desire My heart's desire and
[22:17] prayer to God for Israel is that you
[22:19] might be
[22:20] saved one thing have I
[22:24] desired that I would seek after that I
[22:27] may dwell in the house of the Lord the
[22:28] Rapture brother brandham said so we know
[22:31] that desires come from the heart and how
[22:34] many of you have a desire for
[22:37] God praise God that you do because what
[22:40] would you do without that and who put it
[22:44] there but you know what you can have a
[22:46] desire for God and that's still not
[22:49] everything you can give him your
[22:52] desires but that may not be enough in
[22:55] fact I know it's not cuz the Lord G told
[22:58] told you his will I want
[23:01] all
[23:03] amen you can give him your whole soul
[23:06] you can believe brother banham said you
[23:08] know the woman on the front row it's
[23:10] like the message now I believe she's a
[23:12] Christian woman she make me a fine woman
[23:13] if I made made her a wife but she's not
[23:15] mine until I take her and make her mine
[23:18] it's like with the Bible you can believe
[23:20] the Bible you can believe God you can
[23:23] believe that he can raise the dead he
[23:25] can move mountains he can bless you he
[23:27] can solve your problems and he
[23:29] will this is what's so
[23:32] amazing did not we do many mighty Works
[23:35] did not we lay hands on the sick did not
[23:37] we even move
[23:39] mountains yeah he answered their prayers
[23:43] they had Faith but that wasn't enough I
[23:48] hope you're understand where I'm
[23:49] going I'm just it's just been on my
[23:52] heart you know many men uh can be used
[23:57] of God to do many wonderful things for
[24:00] the kingdom of God many mighty preachers
[24:03] and we could name many of them through
[24:05] the through the last hundred years or
[24:07] even W especially in the last couple
[24:10] hundred years or the last hundred years
[24:12] Mighty miracles in their Ministry and
[24:13] nobody could deny it and then stand look
[24:16] at the word and deny the word do Mighty
[24:20] Miracles and if that's all you want to
[24:22] do for God God will bless you in doing
[24:25] it but that's still not all what he was
[24:27] looking for yes remember there's a
[24:29] secret mystery desire that he had in his
[24:33] heart but he can't force this one can't
[24:37] force this
[24:39] one now he says now look what is faith
[24:42] faith is a six sense five senses control
[24:46] this man God put man in five senses to
[24:48] contact his Earthly H home you don't
[24:51] contact god with your five senses you
[24:53] know God by faith which is the six sense
[24:56] which is the two senses of of the Soul
[24:59] Faith or unbelief and if you're
[25:02] possessed with faith then faith is just
[25:04] as real is such a reality to you but
[25:07] then bringing into view Matthew 7 many
[25:10] will say in that day Lord Lord have not
[25:12] I prophesied in thy name have not I cast
[25:15] out devils in thy name have not I done
[25:18] many wondrous Works in thy name and I
[25:21] will profess to them I never knew you
[25:25] depart from me you worker of iniquity
[25:28] why wow it's tough amazing from the soul
[25:32] you could have faith in God and still be
[25:34] departed you could still depart and you
[25:36] understand with what I'm saying here you
[25:38] could take this the wrong way but I'm
[25:39] I'm saying this for this
[25:42] portion he said love the Lord thy God
[25:44] with all your mind now you know and I
[25:49] know there is a battle for your
[25:50] attention like there never was before
[25:53] and don't you dare think that you don't
[25:55] have a real battle going on every day
[25:58] because you know you do never in any
[26:00] other age has the human mind been
[26:02] bombarded with information and
[26:05] opportunities and to satisfy the desires
[26:07] of your heart and you know why people
[26:10] are losing their
[26:11] minds it's what they're feeding on all
[26:14] day long because the Bible says he that
[26:19] keepeth uh he keepeth thee at perfect
[26:21] peace who's what mind is stayed on thee
[26:25] so maybe you've given God your desire
[26:26] your heart's desire I want to serve God
[26:29] maybe in your heart you believe him you
[26:30] believe his word but you don't give him
[26:33] your
[26:34] mind he said all your
[26:38] mind what you think about what you're
[26:42] doing how you're entertaining your mind
[26:44] the Bible brother bam said the Holy
[26:46] Ghost is entertained by the word not the
[26:50] world and you know people are losing
[26:53] their minds because they've taken their
[26:55] minds off of the word of God yes
[27:01] now bringing this up into view to show
[27:04] you the
[27:05] battle brother bam says well that's the
[27:08] way it is friend Satan tries to be a
[27:11] hypocrite he tries to show you something
[27:13] better an easier way a more sensible
[27:17] plan but there is no more sensible plan
[27:20] than that God laid at the beginning his
[27:22] word hold that word get a grip on it and
[27:25] let it get a grip on you dropping down
[27:27] the battle raged when Eve opened up her
[27:30] mind to listen to reasoning that's the
[27:33] flu it came in that's the channel it run
[27:35] down her reasoning see in her soul she
[27:38] reasoned her eyes was sight she saw the
[27:43] serpent he was beautiful handsome and
[27:47] far better than her husband and I was
[27:50] bringing this up with a brother the
[27:51] other day I says you know what's so
[27:52] interesting to me there was a battle
[27:54] raging in her mind she saw this great
[27:57] big beautiful creature that was telling
[28:00] her things and it sounded amazing and
[28:03] then she could think back to her husband
[28:05] simple
[28:06] humble husband Adam and you begin to
[28:10] think about what was raging on today in
[28:12] our minds you look at the things of the
[28:14] world brother bam said sin is twice as
[28:16] pleasurable sin is pleasurable for a
[28:19] season but it brings death and I said
[28:21] you you know what every time you look at
[28:23] your phone every time there's something
[28:25] there your body releases a chemical
[28:27] called dopamine yes and you get a thrill
[28:30] out of it you do every one of you do
[28:34] that's why you get nervous when you
[28:35] can't find your phone you're addicted to
[28:39] it yes and your body craves it and every
[28:43] time you look at that phone every time
[28:45] you see a screen or an image flash body
[28:47] releases dopamine dopamine dopamine
[28:49] dopamine it's a pleasure you're getting
[28:51] great pleasure from
[28:53] it and you're you're constantly looking
[28:56] to satisfy that car
[28:58] pleasure yes and people are losing their
[29:01] minds because of
[29:04] this now I understand there's sometimes
[29:07] chemical imbalances but I fully believe
[29:09] with all my heart people have taken
[29:12] their eyes off the word of God and off
[29:13] the message and they keep put looking at
[29:15] the wrong things they're feeding off
[29:17] those evil spirits and they're losing
[29:19] their minds left and
[29:22] right people nervous anxious can't be
[29:26] settled down for nothing running here
[29:29] running there always upset about
[29:31] something why don't you pray why don't
[29:35] you stop looking at that rotten phone
[29:37] and pray why don't you read your Bible I
[29:41] asked the kids this last week I said how
[29:43] many have spent a half hour in
[29:44] prayer I'll ask the adults how many have
[29:47] spent a half hour in
[29:48] prayer should be all of us brother and
[29:50] you know it you were that
[29:54] busy I'm guilty too I'm guilty
[29:58] but I have to be honest even if it cuts
[30:01] me to my very core I'll be honest and I
[30:03] can't get away from what's on my heart I
[30:05] cannot do it the battle's Raging and
[30:08] guess what everybody you're not as
[30:10] Victorious as you may like to put on for
[30:12] all of
[30:13] us we're all great Christians I told the
[30:15] youth you're all greatl looking
[30:16] Christians when you're a part of a group
[30:19] you look good you talk right you look
[30:22] right you act right you sing the right
[30:24] songs and you stay in tune you look
[30:25] engaged when we're all together but what
[30:28] about when you're all alone and you get
[30:29] to make your own choice today what
[30:30] you're going to look at what you're
[30:32] going to do what you're going to pursue
[30:33] where you're going to give your strength
[30:34] where you're going to give your mind
[30:35] where you're going to give the heart's
[30:36] desires to where you at
[30:39] everyone we say we're the Bride of Jesus
[30:42] Christ we say we are doesn't the Bride
[30:45] of Jesus Christ have him only as his
[30:49] desire isn't he only the thing they give
[30:52] their strength to isn't he there
[30:54] everything or supposed to be
[30:59] everything not
[31:00] part I'm guilty many times I've given
[31:04] part of my strength part of my life and
[31:06] I haven't given him all of my
[31:09] life because there's too much self in
[31:19] me the last day spirit that we all must
[31:21] be guarding against brother Bram said
[31:23] was this I want to give you a warning it
[31:26] says concerning the last days that
[31:27] because CA of abounding iniquity the
[31:29] love of many will wax cold in the lead
[31:33] in or last age self-love and the love of
[31:37] material things carnally
[31:40] minded will take the place of the true
[31:43] love of God we need to guard against the
[31:45] power of sin in these last days so many
[31:48] are getting so hard because they haven't
[31:51] realized the effect of this last day
[31:55] Spirit have you felt the effects of this
[31:58] last day Spirit do you find yourself
[32:01] concerned worried anxious what's going
[32:04] on with politics what's going on with
[32:05] the economy I probably should make more
[32:07] money I probably should get a better job
[32:09] I probably should improve this and I
[32:10] probably should improve that uhoh you're
[32:13] talking like the rest of the world
[32:15] talks that's how unbelievers speak take
[32:19] no thought for what you shall eat or
[32:20] your rainment he does take care of the
[32:22] birds in the air how much more will he
[32:25] take care of
[32:26] you see amen that's not always your
[32:29] response and you know it hasn't always
[32:32] been my response and I know it it's
[32:35] because I have been affected by this
[32:37] Endtime Spirit self-love preserve
[32:43] self love for material things I was
[32:46] telling the kids you think about this
[32:47] everyone go back a 100 or 200 years ago
[32:51] how many opportunities did a 13 14 year
[32:54] old boy have 200 years ago

[32:59] doing every day he's farming if daddy's
[33:03] a blacksmith guess what that boy's doing
[33:05] every day he's a
[33:07] blacksmith if Daddy says we're working
[33:09] 14 hours a day the boy's working 14
[33:12] hours a
[33:13] day no nothing going to change now look
[33:17] at where you stand right
[33:19] now in the
[33:22] very center of Satan's Eden every
[33:26] opportunity to do all almost whatever
[33:28] you want to do is available for
[33:31] you you can pursue any heart's desire
[33:35] that you truly have you can go anywhere
[33:38] that you really want to go you can
[33:41] entertain yourself with almost anything
[33:44] you want at all
[33:46] times you telling me that this isn't
[33:48] Satan's
[33:52] Eden
[33:54] wow and we got to guard against it yes
[33:57] sir because it's having an effect and it
[34:00] will cool us all off we can't just come
[34:03] here and shout and praise God and say
[34:04] hey woohoo I'm the bride and then get
[34:07] just going down the stream of life with
[34:09] everybody
[34:09] else my goodness you better fight
[34:12] against that thing you have to fight

[34:16] guess what suit up get ready your mind's
[34:20] being attacked constantly your flesh is
[34:22] under attack constantly look at the
[34:24] amount of fear that's in the system

[34:28] know what's happening to America it
[34:30] doesn't take much to look around look
[34:32] like things are getting worse a lot
[34:34] worse really fast you know it and I know
[34:37] it you see the cost of goods going up
[34:39] you see the situation and uncertainty of

[34:55] gun I'm just telling you
[34:58] these are the things the carnal mind
[34:59] instantly go to and don't act like you
[35:01] haven't thought those things maybe we
[35:03] should diversify and buy gold rather
[35:05] than the dollar the Dollar's collapsing
[35:06] milk $16 a gallon what are you going to
[35:09] do have I saved up enough for retirement
[35:12] am I working maybe I should get two
[35:14] jobs

[35:21] quiet you all is too quiet maybe it's
[35:24] just me maybe it's just me
[35:28] all thy mind I'll labor on this for a
[35:31] moment 2 Corinthians says for though we
[35:34] walk in the flesh we do not war after
[35:36] the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare
[35:39] are not carnal But Mighty through God to
[35:41] the pulling down of strongholds casting
[35:44] down imaginations and every High thing
[35:46] that exalteth itself against the
[35:48] knowledge of God and bringing into
[35:50] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[35:52] of Christ are you fighting a good fight
[35:56] there when doubt worry concern and fear
[35:59] come are you grabbing it two hands
[36:01] saying nope that didn't come from God
[36:04] and I'm not even going to entertain it
[36:06] I'm not going to allow that thought to
[36:07] stay in my mind and create fear and
[36:09] cause me to compromise on my purpose in
[36:12] this life your purpose is to not make a
[36:14] bunch of money and relax and make life
[36:16] as comfortable as possible do you know
[36:19] that the American culture says pursue
[36:22] pursue pursue get more get more get more
[36:25] and get everything you can and make
[36:26] every problem you have or every
[36:28] difficult thing that you go through go
[36:31] away do you think that's God's
[36:34] way
[36:36] no no but he's going to let you make a
[36:41] choice he lets us all make
[36:44] choices what will we
[36:47] do when he stands silent and he doesn't
[36:50] tell you to do anything and nobody else
[36:53] tells you to do anything what do you do
[36:58] we've entered into an interesting phase
[37:01] for the Bride of Jesus Christ I believe
[37:04] I believe now it's her turn to respond
[37:08] am I think it's now he showed us his
[37:12] word his life and his
[37:14] desires now he must stand silent and see
[37:18] what she will
[37:23] do Solomon gave all his mind to God
[37:28] didn't he he said Lord I need wisdom to
[37:31] rule your people and he was A Gifted Man
[37:34] a word of discernment brother bham said
[37:36] wisdom like no other man that had been
[37:38] on the earth outside of Jesus Christ no
[37:41] one was like Solomon and what did he do
[37:43] with that great gift he pursued and did
[37:46] everything he wanted to do he says in
[37:49] Ecclesiastes the words of the preacher
[37:51] the son of David King of Jerusalem
[37:53] vanity of vanity saith the preacher
[37:56] vanity of vanity
[37:58] all is Vanity what profit hath a man of
[38:02] all his labor which he taketh Under the
[38:05] Sun I made me great works I builded me
[38:09] houses I planted me Vineyards and I made
[38:12] me Gardens of orchards I planted trees
[38:15] in them of all kinds of of fruits I made
[38:17] me pools of water to water there in the
[38:20] wood that bringeth forth trees I got me
[38:24] servants I got me maids I had servants
[38:26] born in the house also I had great
[38:28] possessions of Great and Small cattle
[38:31] above all that were in Jerusalem before
[38:33] me I gathered me also silver gold
[38:36] precious Treasures of the kings of the
[38:38] provinces I got me men singers women
[38:40] singers and the Delights of the sons of
[38:42] men musical instruments of All
[38:45] Sorts he had it all
[38:48] everybody and you know what he said all
[38:51] is
[38:53] what
[38:55] vanity so I was great increased more and
[38:58] all that than all that were before me in
[39:00] Jerusalem also my wisdom remained with
[39:04] me God never removed it his gift and
[39:08] whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not
[39:11] from them I withheld not my heart from
[39:15] any joy for my heart rejoiced in all my
[39:19] labor and this was my portion of all my
[39:22] labor then I looked on all the works
[39:26] that my hand had wrought and on the
[39:29] labor that I had labored to do and
[39:31] behold all was vanity and vexation of my
[39:34] spirit and there was no Prophet Under
[39:36] the Sun here is an example of a man who
[39:39] gave God all his
[39:42] mind but what happened in the end did he
[39:45] give all God's all his heart to God
[39:49] no First Kings 11:4 for it came to pass
[39:53] when Solomon was old that his wives
[39:56] turned away his heart from other gods
[39:58] and his heart was not perfect with the
[40:01] Lord for Lord his God and his heart and
[40:05] as was the heart of David for Solomon
[40:08] went unto astroth the goddess of the
[40:10] zidian and under Malin the abomination
[40:13] of the amorites and Solomon did evil in
[40:16] the sight of God and went not fully
[40:20] after the
[40:21] Lord
[40:23] H gave his
[40:25] mind just not his heart
[40:28] heart wouldn't give it
[40:34] all Colossians says if ye be risen with
[40:38] Christ seek those things that are above
[40:41] where Christ sth on the right hand of
[40:44] God set your affections on things above
[40:48] and not on things of the Earth for you
[40:51] are dead and your life is hid with
[40:54] Christ in God when Christ who is our
[40:57] life life shall appear then shall ye
[41:00] also appear with him in glory mortify
[41:03] Therefore your members which are upon
[41:05] the Earth fornication uncleanness
[41:09] inordinate affection evil
[41:12] concubus and
[41:14] covetousness which is
[41:17] idolatry what happened to Solomon
[41:22] covetousness his eyes were never
[41:24] satisfied he wanted everything he
[41:27] desired he was never satisfied and he
[41:31] went to what
[41:33] idolatry
[41:35] H Isaiah says he keepeth thee at perfect
[41:39] peace whose mind is stayed in thee
[41:41] because he trusteth in thee there is a
[41:44] promise that God will bring up peace if
[41:47] you just make him first in your mind you
[41:51] don't have to be stressed out and trying
[41:53] to figure out how to solve life's
[41:55] problems and how you're going to fix
[41:57] this and how you're going to fix that
[41:59] and what if this happens and what if
[42:00] that happens you know what you'll be in
[42:03] a a nervous wreck anxious never settled
[42:08] upset all the time if you live that way
[42:12] you keep trying to solve your problems
[42:14] and you'll make them
[42:16] worse but he promised you just seek me
[42:20] first you just keep me on your mind
[42:22] watch what will
[42:24] happen this is simple y'all's know this
[42:27] is truth right you set your affections
[42:30] on things above you keep him on your
[42:33] mind and stop worrying about everything
[42:37] going on around you we're Believers we
[42:40] don't worry we don't have fear we have
[42:43] faith that God will take care of his
[42:49] own he says be careful for nothing but
[42:53] in everything through prayer and
[42:54] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[42:56] requests be made known unto God and the
[42:58] peace of God which passeth all
[43:01] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[43:03] Minds through Christ Jesus finally
[43:06] Brethren whatsoever things are true
[43:09] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[43:12] things are just whatsoever things are
[43:14] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[43:16] whatsoever things are of a good report
[43:18] if there be any virtue if there be any
[43:20] praise at all think on those things
[43:23] you're commanded by God to not even
[43:26] think think of the things that aren't
[43:29] truthful or the things that aren't Pure
[43:32] or the things that are not of a good
[43:35] report how many tune into the news to
[43:38] get good
[43:40] reports when's the last time you're like
[43:42] I got to see some good news from Fox CNN
[43:47] they got some good news for me they got
[43:49] good
[43:51] reports you know we're not supposed to
[43:53] do
[43:54] that I'm okay with you know kind of
[43:57] understand a little bit of what's going
[43:58] on but we're not supposed to be
[43:59] entertaining our minds with that
[44:01] nonsense all the time you wonder why
[44:04] men's hearts are failing them for fear
[44:06] they're feeding off of those fearful
[44:08] evil spirits constantly creating
[44:10] unbelief in their hearts and then their
[44:11] minds are
[44:13] breaking they don't think about the
[44:15] right things they're always thinking
[44:16] about the problems they're always
[44:17] thinking about the situations that
[44:19] around them they can't figure out and
[44:21] they don't know what to do and they wish
[44:22] someone would fix them and then they
[44:24] lose their minds nervous
[44:28] wonder what's going on you're not
[44:30] thinking on those things that are pure
[44:33] honest and of a good
[44:39] report you know that Samson gave all his
[44:44] strength to God but he wouldn't give his
[44:48] heart God is only trying to find one
[44:52] person he can get in his hands he has
[44:56] always tried to do that you notice all
[45:00] down through the Bible when we find we
[45:02] found an Isaiah when we found a Jeremiah
[45:05] then we found a Samson one day but
[45:08] Samson gave his strength to God but he
[45:11] gave his heart to Delilah see you've got
[45:14] to give your all to God your reverence
[45:18] your respects your everything that you
[45:21] are just be nothing just see how little
[45:26] you are
[45:27] and that's what God wants us to
[45:32] do God's not looking for you to do
[45:35] anything great and big in the eyes of
[45:37] the world did you know that I have
[45:40] struggled with that my whole life I've
[45:43] told the kids I've had a okay you know
[45:45] brother brother Chad said the other day
[45:47] he said you know what a pastor told him
[45:49] he struggled with something it wasn't
[45:51] until he confessed it that it broke I
[45:53] told the kids and brother Gabe was there
[45:55] too I said my whole life I have never
[45:57] felt that I had anything to offer I have
[46:00] struggled with that complex very much I
[46:03] thought there was no value to me and you
[46:05] know what I did from a complex I went
[46:08] out to try to prove my value to this
[46:12] world I have had success in business and
[46:15] I went out and I would buy houses and
[46:17] you know what with every one of those
[46:19] houses I felt a little better about
[46:21] myself because there was an Evidence of
[46:23] my value and it was all in vain right
[46:28] yes yes and it meant
[46:34] nothing because I was already
[46:38] valued I was already a son what more
[46:41] value do I
[46:42] need what more do I need in this natural
[46:45] life than to see the grace of God come
[46:48] my way and reveal to me that I'm a part
[46:50] of him you're a part of him what do you
[46:53] have to prove from this point
[46:54] on you're a son or a daughter of
[46:57] almighty God there's nothing to prove to
[47:00] anybody but often times we do things out
[47:02] of our own complexes we try to cover we
[47:06] don't want the pain of letting a complex
[47:09] be dealt
[47:11] with often times we all do this in our
[47:14] own ways and guess what you all have
[47:16] complexes and don't you act like you
[47:18] don't if you believe the message of God
[47:20] and the prophet of God he said we all
[47:22] got them and we all got them I got them
[47:26] too
[47:27] and it's been one of those things I've
[47:29] fought with my whole life and God in his
[47:32] Mercy I believe will help me I believe
[47:34] he's helping me even
[47:38] now but there's no value in pursuing
[47:40] those things what good is it to give my
[47:43] strength to pursue something that
[47:45] burns why not give my strength to
[47:48] something that'll last for all
[47:50] eternity but it's a choice I have to
[47:53] make he's not going to back me into a
[47:56] corner corner and he ain't going to back
[47:58] you into a corner you know
[48:01] that I talked to the chapel kids last
[48:04] couple weeks ago I don't know these
[48:06] services are running together I was
[48:08] telling them I was I I brought three
[48:09] little crosses a little cross a medium
[48:12] cross and a great big cross to the
[48:14] Chapel at the school each one of them I
[48:17] wrote down his will was up and down and
[48:22] our will across and I wrote on that
[48:25] cross what that cross represent
[48:27] shame humility
[48:30] despisement pain everything negative is
[48:34] on that cross and you know what I held
[48:36] each one of them up and I brought
[48:38] different kids up one were little kids
[48:40] some big kids I put the big kid with the
[48:42] little cross I said that's not your
[48:44] cross then I brought uh vice versa a
[48:47] little kid with a big cross is that
[48:49] that's not your cross and then
[48:51] eventually we found someone for each
[48:53] cross I said ah see that's your cross
[48:56] right but there was one last cross there
[48:59] it was great big 6' 4 I said now this is
[49:03] a big cross this is a big burden I can't
[49:07] even bear this cross I said this is a
[49:10] cross for someone that can carry it and
[49:12] I can't carry that burden it's for
[49:14] somebody else I said I don't know who it
[49:16] would be for it looks horrible it's
[49:19] painful it's despising it's ridicule
[49:22] it's alone it's miserable cross but I
[49:25] can't force anybody body to carry this
[49:27] cross and neither will
[49:30] God and one person stands up and it's
[49:34] brother rra brother Rap by his own free
[49:37] will got up out of his seat walked over
[49:40] to that cross and it was just for
[49:43] him but that's the reality I told the
[49:45] kids you know what we've come to the
[49:48] point God didn't back us into a corner
[49:51] and force us on a cross of suffering now
[49:54] we make our own choice to suffer for
[49:57] Christ often times we really do you
[50:00] honestly in your heart you want God to
[50:02] do everything for you you want him to
[50:04] perfect you he you want him to fix
[50:06] everything in your life Lord get me in
[50:07] the condition for the Rapture sake you
[50:09] know you got to make some
[50:12] choices you know he learned obedience
[50:14] through much suffering and you will do
[50:17] the same but I believe the majority of
[50:19] suffering to come for you now is of your
[50:21] own
[50:23] choosing you chose a harder way your
[50:26] self and God didn't back you into a
[50:28] corner to do
[50:31] it when she went and broke that
[50:34] Alabaster Box nobody told her to do
[50:37] it nobody said you know what it's okay
[50:41] you get rid of all your money this is
[50:43] what you've saved up for it's your only
[50:45] path to get out of this life of mess if
[50:47] you'll do it I'm sure God Will Make A
[50:48] Way he'll bless you he'll save you and
[50:50] then he'll give you a a whole bunch of
[50:52] money so you can get out of this life
[50:53] she didn't know what she was going to do
[50:56] she was stuck she hadn't a clue what was
[51:00] going to happen she just knew I want to
[51:02] do something for him I believe him I
[51:07] believe he's the Lord I have a heart's
[51:09] desire desire to do something for him I
[51:12] can't get him out of my mind I know
[51:14] people will think I'm crazy for what I'm
[51:15] about to do and then she went and did it
[51:19] and nobody forced her to do it he didn't
[51:22] even say anything to her he just stood
[51:25] there silent
[51:28] God's doing great big things in
[51:32] silence gaining preeminence not taking
[51:35] it not taking it you're giving it amen
[51:43] amen it was all now in
[51:47] silence I began to think also the
[51:51] woman when Elijah came to a widow
[51:55] woman think of the
[51:57] situation there's a drought there's
[51:59] judgment in the land how many know
[52:01] America's under
[52:03] judgment
[52:04] 100% you can't stop
[52:07] it under judgment the land's under
[52:10] judgment Elijah said it's not going to
[52:11] rain for three and a half years until I
[52:13] call for it well he didn't say three and
[52:14] half years he's not going to rain till I
[52:15] call for it so there's a drought there's
[52:18] nothing to eat people are starving to
[52:20] death this is a difficult situation none
[52:23] of us have been in that situation before
[52:26] she's walking to get two little
[52:29] sticks so that she can make a little
[52:32] fire bake a little cake and
[52:37] die Elijah comes to her and it
[52:40] says bake me a cake
[52:44] first you imagine the battle she had for
[52:47] a moment in her
[52:49] mind I don't think it was okay sure no
[52:52] problem yep okay let me go make you that
[52:54] and yeah I know you'll you'll you'll
[52:56] I don't think it was instantaneous the
[52:59] scripture you just read on through it I
[53:01] think he might have waited in silence
[53:03] for a moment let the battle rage in her
[53:07] mind
[53:10] what I will surely die if I do what
[53:12] you're asking me to
[53:14] do it's
[53:16] amazing but she did it she went and had
[53:21] so much faith in what this man was
[53:22] saying that what he was saying bake me
[53:25] the cake first the the barrel shall
[53:27] never run empty and the barrel shall
[53:29] never run dry and the creu shall never
[53:30] run empty she did it she believed him
[53:34] she gave
[53:35] all and God preserved her life through
[53:38] the midst of that
[53:40] drought and that judgment
[53:43] amen and it's just interesting that
[53:46] we've come back to these same
[53:48] situations brother bham this was the
[53:50] quote that jumped out to me last Sunday
[53:53] as she was try and as she was trying to
[53:55] say something and and couldn't the tears
[53:57] were just running off his off of his
[54:00] feet she didn't have any water to wash
[54:03] his feet with the Pharisees hadn't given
[54:06] her no water but what beautiful water he
[54:09] had tears of repentance washing Jesus's
[54:12] dirty feet oh God tears of repentance
[54:17] washing Jesus's Dirty Feet she'd washed
[54:20] them and then she' kissed them and
[54:22] washed them and she she broke the top
[54:25] off the little box and she p the
[54:26] ointment on there and she looked up now
[54:29] if he had moved she'd had gotten out of
[54:33] there in a minute but he just if she
[54:37] wanted to do him a service he just set
[54:41] still and let her do it I love that if
[54:45] you want to do him service he will set
[54:48] still and let you go ahead undo
[54:55] it I believe God's sitting still
[54:59] now I believe now we've come to the plan
[55:03] part of the story he's done what he
[55:05] needed to do now she must do what she
[55:08] must do to show who she really is on the
[55:12] inside we may not be much to look at on
[55:14] the outside and I promise you I sure am
[55:17] not neither was this woman prostitute
[55:21] nothing on the outside that we could say
[55:22] was good about her but on the inside
[55:25] what happened
[55:26] she loved the Lord with all her heart
[55:29] with all her soul with all her mind and
[55:32] now with all her strength amen she did
[55:35] she gave everything to him she expressed
[55:40] how much he meant to
[55:46] her and she said as the Lord thy God
[55:49] liveth I have not a cake but a handful
[55:52] of meal in the barrel and a little oil
[55:54] in the Cru and behold I am Gathering two
[55:57] sticks that I may go in and dress it for
[55:58] me and my son that I may eat it and die
[56:02] and Elijah said unto her fear not go and
[56:05] do as thou has said but make me
[56:08] therefore a little cake first and bring
[56:12] it unto me and make and after make thee
[56:16] thee and for thy
[56:18] son my God sometimes just creates a
[56:22] situation for you to make a choice I've
[56:25] been in a min of times and I've made the
[56:27] wrong choice many of
[56:30] times but may God help us all to start
[56:32] making him the only choice we're worth
[56:35] living for at this point we're going to
[56:37] have to come to that point he's not
[56:39] going to force you to do it anymore he's
[56:41] going to sit there silent and still
[56:44] watch what you will do will you take
[56:48] that job that takes you away from church
[56:51] it's a career choice it's a better
[56:53] paying job but it'll take you out of
[56:55] Fellowship ship right will you pursue
[56:58] that one activity you really love I mean
[57:00] it's your passion in life but my it's
[57:03] taking up all your time you have no time
[57:04] to prayer
[57:06] anymore like will you continue to try to
[57:08] stay in fellowship with everybody and
[57:10] you're socially connected to everyone in
[57:12] the church and you don't even know the
[57:14] last time you went into deep prayer for
[57:16] somebody connected to everybody else and
[57:19] not connected with God let me ask you
[57:22] what do you think he wants
[57:27] amen but he's not going to back you in a
[57:29] corner anymore when I was a child you
[57:31] all know this When We Were Young when
[57:33] you're children your parents watch over
[57:36] you and do everything for you right you
[57:39] start to take your first steps there's a
[57:41] mom or a dad there holding both hands
[57:43] don't want him to get hurt don't want
[57:44] him to go the wrong way let me hold his
[57:47] hands right he gets a little older Mom
[57:50] and Dad they don't completely abandon
[57:52] the child they watch him they're pretty
[57:53] close they're not make sure he don't
[57:55] fall down the stairs or something like
[57:56] that but they stay pretty close but
[57:58] they're letting him make a little bit
[57:59] more making a little Freedom Little
[58:01] Steps little more of a steps that he
[58:02] wants to make but as that parent or that
[58:05] child grows older what does the parent
[58:08] do let's
[58:10] go make your own choice it's your time
[58:13] to decide if you want to go that way you
[58:16] can go that way I have nothing more to
[58:18] say I'm now
[58:20] silent the parents can't tell the
[58:22] children what to do anymore you have no
[58:24] right
[58:26] you actually just have to sit back and
[58:28] trust God from this
[58:30] point and God's doing that with us he's
[58:34] raising mature Sons and Daughters of God
[58:38] Amen active and involved when you
[58:41] started off with the Lord you notice
[58:42] that each of us I do when I first
[58:44] started walking the Lord I showed up
[58:46] here 15 years 14 years ago I don't even
[58:48] know but he was so actively involved in
[58:50] every decision I felt like oh yeah he
[58:52] don't want me to do that oh I better do
[58:53] this and oh yep and and then as time
[58:56] goes
[58:57] on it's interesting I realize I can
[59:00] start making this choices and I don't
[59:02] exactly always know what he wants and
[59:05] sometimes he even blesses decisions that
[59:07] I kind of question whether or not I
[59:08] should do
[59:11] that that's what will really throw you
[59:14] for a loot you kind of do something you
[59:17] weren't quite sure he wanted you to do
[59:18] it but it made a lot of sense in doing
[59:20] it so you did it anyhow and then God
[59:23] blesses you in doing it but all the
[59:25] while there's that question mark you
[59:26] never did this in faith you never had a
[59:29] true faith that that's what God wanted
[59:30] you to do but God still blessed you in
[59:33] doing
[59:37] it I'm telling you you believe this is
[59:40] true you you you believe this is what's
[59:42] going on you could testify in your own
[59:45] life you've had those kind of things
[59:46] happen in your own life little decisions
[59:48] you've made you weren't quite sure and
[59:50] you're pretty confident you could be
[59:52] honest now and say that wasn't the right
[59:53] decision and yet God still blessed me in
[59:55] doing it why did he do
[59:57] that maybe he always wants me to just go
[59:59] and do the things that I want to
[1:00:02] do
[1:00:04] no but he's not going to come out and
[1:00:06] tell you right away he'll let you make
[1:00:08] your
[1:00:09] choice Moses by faith when he was come
[1:00:13] to years refused to be called the son of
[1:00:16] daugh of of Pharaoh's daughter
[1:00:19] choosing What Choosing rather to suffer
[1:00:23] Affliction with God's people the people
[1:00:26] of God than to enjoy the pleasures of
[1:00:29] sin for a SE season esteeming the
[1:00:32] reproach of Christ greater riches than
[1:00:34] the treasures in Egypt for he had
[1:00:37] respect unto the recompense of the
[1:00:39] reward God never forced Moses to suffer
[1:00:43] Moses made his choice to suffer for
[1:00:45] Christ's
[1:00:46] sake God's not going to make you suffer
[1:00:49] for his sake you're going to make your
[1:00:51] own choice to suffer for Christ's sake
[1:00:59] you okay I little
[1:01:03] more brother brandom we all know brother
[1:01:05] brandom had a complex don't we I love
[1:01:08] the fact that he was not afraid to show
[1:01:09] us his weak spots he stayed a
[1:01:12] man when I was a little boy I wasn't
[1:01:15] loved and nobody cared for me when I was
[1:01:19] a kid and I when I found out found
[1:01:22] somebody that loved me I thought I I
[1:01:24] want to die for them
[1:01:26] and now because somebody loves me
[1:01:28] somebody cares I was climbing one time
[1:01:30] on a post and my hook slipped out on a
[1:01:33] old cedar post and the knot was up high
[1:01:36] and I hit it with my spur and it turned
[1:01:38] me around I fell about 15 ft and I
[1:01:40] caught it caught on my arm and a lady
[1:01:42] screamed and she kind of patted herself
[1:01:45] like that I always like that lady she
[1:01:50] cared she was somebody who cared and I
[1:01:53] always thought anybody who cared for me
[1:01:56] I love
[1:01:58] them brother Branham wasn't loved as a
[1:02:01] kid he loved people and people didn't
[1:02:04] love him he was a brandom he had a bad
[1:02:07] name bad reputation and nobody loved
[1:02:10] brother brandham but he loved
[1:02:12] people and now what happens when he
[1:02:15] comes and he starts making his own
[1:02:16] decisions in the ministry do people come
[1:02:19] to him and offer him Fellowship big
[1:02:22] fellowship and love if he'll just
[1:02:24] compromise a little on the word of God
[1:02:27] did not the angel Lord tell him you'll
[1:02:29] lose thousands of your friends if you
[1:02:32] preach these things right so brother
[1:02:35] Branham had a a complex his whole life
[1:02:37] he wanted to be loved but he had to be
[1:02:40] willing to be rejected to serve God
[1:02:43] completely and utterly rejected to stay
[1:02:47] with the
[1:02:49] word man that was his weak spot everyone
[1:02:52] remember the story remember the picture
[1:02:54] of brother Bram was standing by Oral
[1:02:55] Roberts and he's up on his tippy
[1:02:58] toes yeah had a
[1:03:02] complex felt inferior wanted to be loved
[1:03:06] wanted to be
[1:03:09] liked so he had some choices to make and
[1:03:13] because thou has chosen the Narrow Path
[1:03:16] and the harder way thou Hast walked in
[1:03:19] thine own choosing thou Hast picked the
[1:03:21] correct and precise decision and it is
[1:03:23] my way because of this momentous
[1:03:26] decision a huge portion of heaven will
[1:03:28] await thee what a glorious decision thou
[1:03:31] Hast made this in itself is that which
[1:03:35] will give and make to come to pass a
[1:03:38] tremendous victory in the love
[1:03:42] divine it was all expressed when someone
[1:03:44] chose the harder way he showed us he
[1:03:48] gave us an example of what divine love
[1:03:51] really was all about Divine love makes a
[1:03:54] choice of your own choosing no one told
[1:03:58] him to do it he didn't feel a pressure
[1:04:00] he didn't feel God would bless him more
[1:04:02] or God would love him less he made his
[1:04:05] own choice he made a choice for a harder
[1:04:08] way a harder life I mean he tore up a
[1:04:11] million dollars I think twice if I
[1:04:13] remember this right how many of you
[1:04:16] going to tear up a million
[1:04:18] dollars he did he chose a harder life a
[1:04:23] life of suffering his whole life
[1:04:26] because there was only one thing he
[1:04:27] loved more than everything and that was
[1:04:30] God and he just wanted to serve him and
[1:04:33] he didn't want anything to get in the
[1:04:34] way or distract him from that purpose so
[1:04:37] he ripped it
[1:04:45] up so he goes over and gets a little
[1:04:48] garbage pale this is the story of zakus
[1:04:51] when he climbed up the tree wanted to
[1:04:52] see Jesus goes over garbage pale picks
[1:04:56] it up over and sets it down Shin shinys
[1:04:58] up the tree you know gets up there and
[1:05:00] he found where two limbs come together
[1:05:02] so he could make him a good seat and sit
[1:05:05] down that's a good place to sit down and
[1:05:07] think it all over brother where two ways
[1:05:10] meet yours and God's and think it over
[1:05:14] sitting there on a limb that's what that
[1:05:17] cross
[1:05:18] represents decision time choices to be
[1:05:22] made and you will always suffer if you
[1:05:25] choose the harder way but remember
[1:05:27] that's his
[1:05:29] way his way is not the easier way his
[1:05:32] way is the harder way and I've said this
[1:05:35] before I know I said it to the kids you
[1:05:37] get to the point you don't know what you
[1:05:38] said to who but
[1:05:39] nonetheless you
[1:05:41] know if there's a
[1:05:44] cross and you know you're supposed to be
[1:05:46] carrying one every day and you can't
[1:05:48] find it you don't know what decision
[1:05:50] you're making consciously to suffer for
[1:05:53] Christ's sake you're probably on the the
[1:05:55] wrong path that's right there's a cross
[1:05:58] for everyone there's a cross for you and
[1:06:01] if you can't find it brother you're
[1:06:04] probably too far up the path of your own
[1:06:07] choosing to even see the cross was way
[1:06:10] back
[1:06:12] there so it may cause you to have to
[1:06:15] turn around make some things right go
[1:06:18] back the other way find that thing that
[1:06:21] you didn't want to deny yourself in
[1:06:23] doing or pursuing and pick it up and
[1:06:26] carry it for Christ's sake because
[1:06:28] you're never removing a cross from
[1:06:30] Christianity don't you ever think that
[1:06:32] the Bride of Jesus Christ has a flowery
[1:06:34] bed of ease and she doesn't have to
[1:06:36] suffer anything for Christ's sake she
[1:06:39] does she suffers of her own
[1:06:45] choosing and when I look at the cross I
[1:06:47] can see something better I think of the
[1:06:49] ransom cross that God Almighty Out of
[1:06:51] Heaven who saved my soul and I think
[1:06:54] that on that cross and emblem of
[1:06:57] suffering and
[1:06:59] shame it has always been that it will
[1:07:03] always be that but it's a great Victory
[1:07:06] because he chose it for you you know
[1:07:08] nobody put him on the
[1:07:10] cross nobody the Bible says no man took
[1:07:13] his life from him he gave his life for
[1:07:17] you he gave it nobody took it now if
[1:07:21] you're cut out of the same cloth that
[1:07:23] Jesus Christ is do you think you'll be
[1:07:26] giving yourself over to a cross or
[1:07:29] someone's going to have to force you on
[1:07:31] it I think with all my heart the same
[1:07:35] life the same character the brightest
[1:07:37] bone of his bone life of his life power
[1:07:40] of his power she'll make the same
[1:07:42] decision he makes she'll gladly lay down
[1:07:46] her life her desires and all her
[1:07:53] strength think of this young young man
[1:07:56] I've been thinking about the Rich Young
[1:07:57] Ruler for months months he was a good
[1:08:01] boy everyone really a good boy I mean we
[1:08:05] would look at him and think he's the
[1:08:06] model Christian model I mean respectful
[1:08:12] honors always 30 minutes early to church
[1:08:15] always never misses respectful to his
[1:08:18] parents honored them loved them cared
[1:08:21] for them
[1:08:23] model but there was one thing he could
[1:08:25] not give up and that was the one thing
[1:08:28] that separated him from eternal
[1:08:31] life just one thing what a sad situation
[1:08:35] he went away sad cuz there was something
[1:08:38] in him he just loved more than God and
[1:08:42] that's all it took he was like 99% good
[1:08:46] everyone but there was just one thing he
[1:08:48] couldn't let go
[1:08:50] of and God wasn't going to pry it out of
[1:08:53] his
[1:08:53] hands many times s he'll let you hold it
[1:08:58] and hold it and hold it waiting for you
[1:09:01] to drop it and take up a cross and
[1:09:04] follow him you know you can't carry a
[1:09:05] cross and your own desires at the same
[1:09:07] time you just can't do it it's one or
[1:09:10] the other you cannot serve God ad in
[1:09:12] Mammon you cannot care about the things
[1:09:15] of this world and care about doing the
[1:09:16] will of God in the same breath you can't
[1:09:19] do it but I'm afraid at many times we
[1:09:22] want
[1:09:23] both both and many times we want maybe
[1:09:27] we we believe it right we believe it and
[1:09:29] many times we have a desire to be his
[1:09:31] bride but we won't give our strength to
[1:09:34] it we give him leftovers we give him
[1:09:37] part of our Lives yes you know I would
[1:09:40] imagine every old person in here if they
[1:09:42] had the opportunity to change bodies
[1:09:44] with the youth you would do it in a
[1:09:45] heartbeat wouldn't you you would do that
[1:09:47] that's not even without a question right
[1:09:49] you would be so happy to have a renewed
[1:09:52] strength like that what would you do
[1:09:54] with it
[1:09:57] older people what would you do with that
[1:09:59] would you say man I'd have really
[1:10:01] pursued that dream of mine I always had
[1:10:03] I was I
[1:10:06] just or would you say no if I could do
[1:10:08] it all over again I'd have put him first
[1:10:12] I really would have put him first I'd
[1:10:13] have stopped caring about all the things
[1:10:16] of this world that cares this world that
[1:10:18] cares of Life pride of life if I could
[1:10:21] do it over my goodness how many older
[1:10:24] people over 50 40 me included 40 there
[1:10:27] we go we're old how many old you if you
[1:10:31] could do it again if you could trade
[1:10:32] back places with a young body you
[1:10:35] wouldn't take that young body and use it
[1:10:37] to pursue some carnal thing that's right
[1:10:41] I hope that's your
[1:10:43] testimony if you could do it over again
[1:10:45] you'd say if I had it all over again I'd
[1:10:47] give him my
[1:10:49] best I wouldn't wait till there's
[1:10:51] nothing else I could
[1:10:53] do I'd give him my best when I had the
[1:10:55] opportunity to do
[1:10:57] it I believe that's what God wants he
[1:11:00] wants your best he wants everything he's
[1:11:04] not going to force you you make your
[1:11:08] choice I asked my wife cuz I have been
[1:11:10] considering this where's my
[1:11:15] cross I asked my wife and my girls to
[1:11:17] think about this about a month ago I
[1:11:19] said girls where's your cross write it
[1:11:22] down I want to see it
[1:11:25] it's a good exercise go home go home
[1:11:28] you're all alone next time you're in
[1:11:29] prayer write down on a piece of paper
[1:11:31] where you know you're picking up a cross
[1:11:33] for the kingdom of God's sake you're
[1:11:36] carrying a cross not for yourself you're
[1:11:39] carrying it for someone
[1:11:41] else find it there's a cross for
[1:11:45] everyone if you can't find it better go
[1:11:48] backwards too far up the road of your
[1:11:51] desire got to go back to his desire and
[1:11:53] find where it was
[1:11:55] and it's something I've looked at
[1:11:57] because he said Jesus said unto his
[1:11:59] disciple If any man shall come after me
[1:12:01] let him deny himself take up his cross
[1:12:04] and follow me so something that you're
[1:12:07] going to be denying yourself is probably
[1:12:10] really close to where your cross is
[1:12:12] something that you tell yourself
[1:12:16] no I'm going I want to do this but I'm
[1:12:19] not going to do this I'm going to cake
[1:12:21] up a cross I promise you your cross is
[1:12:24] really close to your desire really close
[1:12:28] something you're going to have to deny
[1:12:30] yourself something you may even love
[1:12:33] something you may even be really good
[1:12:36] at for whosoever will lose his life or
[1:12:39] will save his life shall lose it and
[1:12:42] whosoever will lose his life for my sake
[1:12:45] shall find it that word deny is simply
[1:12:49] to forget oneself and lose sight of
[1:12:52] oneself or one's own
[1:12:55] interests remember what Spirit we must
[1:12:57] guard against in this day the spirit of
[1:13:01] self-love do what I want to do pursue
[1:13:04] what I want to pursue go where I want to
[1:13:07] go think about the things I want to
[1:13:10] think about entertain myself with the
[1:13:12] things that I want to entertain myself
[1:13:16] with I'm going to have to deny
[1:13:18] that for his
[1:13:21] sake Philippians 3:7 but what things
[1:13:23] were gained unto me those I counted loss
[1:13:26] for Christ another example Paul the
[1:13:28] Apostle yay doubtless and I count all
[1:13:32] things but loss for the Excellency of
[1:13:35] the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord
[1:13:39] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[1:13:42] things and I count them but dung that I
[1:13:46] may win Christ it's
[1:13:48] dung every bit of this world is dumb
[1:13:53] every good thing the world will tell you
[1:13:55] to pursue is filth it's dung compared to
[1:13:58] Christ and pursuing Christ and living
[1:14:01] your life for those Eternal things just
[1:14:04] living your life for him and for others
[1:14:07] that is what is going to last and Paul
[1:14:10] had that before him at all times right
[1:14:13] having not apprehended yet I press
[1:14:16] toward that Mark of the high calling in
[1:14:18] Christ Jesus I haven't yet grabbed it
[1:14:20] guys but I'm pressing towards that that
[1:14:23] God would get me to the point in this
[1:14:25] life where I can look at everything that
[1:14:27] this world could give me in its best and
[1:14:30] say it's
[1:14:31] D let me suffer the reproach of Christ
[1:14:34] let me take my way with the Lord's
[1:14:36] despised
[1:14:39] VI you okay you all believe this it's
[1:14:43] okay A couple of y'all can say amen I I
[1:14:46] it's okay sister Maria you can even say
[1:14:48] Amen it's fine love love you God bless
[1:14:50] you no but nonetheless if you believe it
[1:14:54] you just take a hold of it remember I'm
[1:14:56] not ask you don't have to remember it
[1:14:58] all you don't have to be able to line it
[1:14:59] all up but if it's striking your heart
[1:15:01] you know it's a truth just believe it
[1:15:04] you receive the word the word itself
[1:15:05] will come to pass you just have to
[1:15:08] believe it remember only believe that's
[1:15:10] why I wanted to sing that song cuz I
[1:15:12] knew this might cut it cut me it's been
[1:15:15] cutting me and I I I just know that's
[1:15:18] what my desire is now God you're going
[1:15:20] to have to bring it to pass in my life
[1:15:22] I'm trying and I'm failing I'm trying
[1:15:23] and I'm failing and it's my heart's
[1:15:25] desire but God you're going to have to
[1:15:27] do this in me I can't do it but the seed
[1:15:30] itself can the only thing I know to do
[1:15:32] is believe it say Amen agree with it say
[1:15:35] Lord bring it to pass in my life let me
[1:15:38] overcome me my greatest of
[1:15:45] enemies I don't know why this came to my
[1:15:49] mind I yesterday I got to thinking right
[1:15:53] before I went to bed of a wedding a vow
[1:15:58] two women or no
[1:16:02] sorry the day and age we live in sadly a
[1:16:06] man and a woman making a vow one to
[1:16:09] another and immediately got to thinking
[1:16:12] of
[1:16:13] Christ and it says this is Brother
[1:16:16] Branham taken from a wedding will you
[1:16:19] take this woman to be your lawful wedded
[1:16:21] wife to live together in in this holy
[1:16:24] state of of matrimony do you promise to
[1:16:27] love honor cherish in sickness and
[1:16:32] health in riches or in poverty and will
[1:16:36] forsake all others and cleave thee only
[1:16:41] unto her as long as you both would
[1:16:44] live and the groom answers I
[1:16:48] will immediately that's what he's told
[1:16:52] you the man speaks first
[1:16:55] he went first and he said I'll take care
[1:16:58] of you I love you I want you more than
[1:17:00] anything in this world I gave my life
[1:17:02] for you I've changed circumstances to
[1:17:05] reveal myself to you I've unveiled who I
[1:17:08] really am but now the man has to stand
[1:17:11] silent because now it's her turn to
[1:17:15] speak will you take this man to be your
[1:17:19] lawful wedded husband to live together
[1:17:22] in this holy matrimony do you promise to
[1:17:25] love to honor to cherish in sickness and
[1:17:29] in health in riches or in poverty and
[1:17:33] will forsake all others and cleave only
[1:17:36] unto him as long as you both shall live
[1:17:39] and the bride
[1:17:43] answers and the bride
[1:17:49] answers the bride answered I
[1:17:52] will you'll leave everything you will
[1:17:55] forsake all and cleave to
[1:17:59] him he spoke first now it's your
[1:18:03] turn so God wants you to love him with
[1:18:06] all your heart with all your soul all
[1:18:09] your mind and all your strength brother
[1:18:11] Brenham said this in the
[1:18:13] token but now the life that was in the
[1:18:16] blood becomes the token and now when we
[1:18:19] identify ourselves in his death burial
[1:18:23] and Resurrection by believing on him and
[1:18:25] being baptized unto his death burial and
[1:18:27] Resurrection when we rise up the holy
[1:18:30] spirit is there to give us a token an
[1:18:33] eternal token written across our heart
[1:18:36] soul makeup Mind Body everything else
[1:18:41] that you are separated person from
[1:18:43] unbelief you're a separated person from
[1:18:46] the things of the world you're a
[1:18:48] separated from Death you're separated
[1:18:50] from everything and you are a product
[1:18:52] that God has sealed into the kingdom by
[1:18:55] his holy spirit when the Holy Spirit
[1:18:57] comes into your life it doesn't just
[1:18:59] cause you to believe the word it causes
[1:19:01] you to believe the word to it cleanses
[1:19:03] your mind it gives you the right heart's
[1:19:05] desire and it puts you in action to
[1:19:08] serve God in his purpose in everything
[1:19:10] that you do from that point on and if
[1:19:12] that's not there stirring you and
[1:19:14] burning within you you may need a bit of
[1:19:16] a refilling and a bit of a stirring
[1:19:18] within your heart you may need to go
[1:19:20] back to the source of strength where you
[1:19:22] once was so excited for God
[1:19:25] and now the world cooled you
[1:19:32] off but you don't have to stay that way
[1:19:35] you know that
[1:19:36] right I don't believe sermons like this
[1:19:38] keep coming brother Ben doesn't preach
[1:19:40] on selfishness brother Gabe brother
[1:19:42] Emanuel brother Chad I don't think God's
[1:19:43] just doing that to just say things I
[1:19:45] think God's literally call he's like man
[1:19:48] how much more clear do I have to tell
[1:19:49] them if they only knew what was behind
[1:19:52] that little cross if they only knew that
[1:19:55] everything they truly desire is behind
[1:19:57] that cross that's the Mirage that's the
[1:19:59] that's the false thing the world tells
[1:20:01] you peace and joy and all of the things
[1:20:04] that you you know you want is behind
[1:20:06] pursuing your own will but actually true
[1:20:09] peace true Joy true satisfaction is all
[1:20:13] in the
[1:20:14] cross it's all right behind it it's
[1:20:17] hiding there and as soon as you take it
[1:20:19] you'll find him a true joy that a joy
[1:20:22] it's not based on circumstances anymore
[1:20:25] you could have Troy in the midst of all
[1:20:27] the trials and your whole life falling
[1:20:29] apart and you've got true joy and a true
[1:20:32] peace because our peace is not
[1:20:34] circumstances our peace is a person
[1:20:38] Jesus Christ Joy is a person salvation
[1:20:42] is a person it's not a set of
[1:20:44] circumstances that we find ourselves
[1:20:49] in so many people unless everything's
[1:20:52] working out just right and everybody's
[1:20:54] acting right they've lost all joy what
[1:20:56] happened they have no peace things
[1:20:58] aren't going the way they thought it
[1:20:59] would go
[1:21:03] what ought not be for the bride ought
[1:21:07] not
[1:21:09] be so we're going to wrap it
[1:21:13] up Mark
[1:21:15] 1230 and thou shalt love the Lord thy
[1:21:18] God just remember it and now think about
[1:21:21] it so many times we've cruised over this
[1:21:23] scripture verse
[1:21:25] there's many elements to what this is
[1:21:27] meaning but I'll tell you one thing that
[1:21:29] compasses all of it it's all of you it's
[1:21:32] all your desires it's all your faith
[1:21:36] it's all your mind and it's all your
[1:21:39] strength the things that you give
[1:21:41] yourself to it's all of it and in fact
[1:21:44] he wants all of it or none of it
[1:21:47] remember Rich Young Ruler gave him 99%
[1:21:50] gave him the majority just didn't give
[1:21:52] him all
[1:22:01] Luke 17
[1:22:04] 20 and when he's demanded of the
[1:22:06] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[1:22:08] come he answered them and said the
[1:22:10] kingdom of God cometh not with
[1:22:13] observation neither shall they say Lo
[1:22:16] here or loow there for the kingdom of
[1:22:19] God is within
[1:22:23] you don't forget the mystery of his
[1:22:26] coming he's looking for a woman that
[1:22:29] will gladly forsake all and embrace him
[1:22:32] alone he's going to come in
[1:22:36] you but you must be willing for him to
[1:22:39] actually be manifested in your life CU
[1:22:41] he's a perfect gentleman and he don't
[1:22:43] force himself on
[1:22:44] nobody it's amazing to think that we
[1:22:47] could go through life we could serve God
[1:22:50] we could go to church we could say Amen
[1:22:52] we could believe the word and realize
[1:22:55] you know down deep in your heart you're
[1:22:56] still not giving them all it's amazing
[1:22:59] we could come year after year after year
[1:23:02] Time After Time After Time we dress the
[1:23:05] right way we talk the right way we sing
[1:23:07] at the right songs we agree with the
[1:23:09] right word and yet you know in your
[1:23:11] heart you're still not giving him you're
[1:23:14] all you entertain yourself with the
[1:23:16] things of the world and the Bible says
[1:23:18] if you love the world or the things of
[1:23:19] the world the love of God's Not in you
[1:23:21] it's just not
[1:23:23] there but we have a sticky cber nature
[1:23:26] and the battle is Raging right now it's
[1:23:29] still ongoing and we all got something
[1:23:32] to do but remember he's not going to
[1:23:34] force this time this is the time where
[1:23:38] the bride now says I
[1:23:40] will I'm not M you're not making me do
[1:23:43] it I'm doing this of my own free will
[1:23:46] how do you think brother Brandon could
[1:23:48] get to the point where he said even if
[1:23:51] he sends me to hell that's right I will
[1:23:54] would still serve him yes sir because he
[1:23:58] loved him and love is a choice amen God
[1:24:01] wasn't going to force him he would still
[1:24:04] serve God and give him his all even if
[1:24:07] he sent him to hell that's right have we
[1:24:09] came there
[1:24:10] yet because Divine love makes that
[1:24:15] choice I intentionally knew that I would
[1:24:17] stop a little
[1:24:19] early um wanting to give this last
[1:24:22] little time if it's all right to
[1:24:25] prayer I am very concerned for myself
[1:24:28] and
[1:24:30] others that we know that we're losing uh
[1:24:34] a battle to a degree at times because we
[1:24:37] just don't pray what do you get in the
[1:24:39] carnal by
[1:24:42] praying
[1:24:44] nothing you have to sacrifice your time
[1:24:47] your energy when you could be out doing
[1:24:49] something
[1:24:50] productive and you know what you do you
[1:24:52] make a sacrifice and you give that time
[1:24:55] to
[1:24:56] God and how often times we just don't
[1:24:59] make any sacrifice
[1:25:01] anymore we just don't we do our
[1:25:04] devotions because we want to check it
[1:25:06] off our little mental list of things we
[1:25:08] needed to do today we pray before our
[1:25:12] dinner our lunch we say Lord please
[1:25:13] bless this food on my body thank you so
[1:25:15] much that don't
[1:25:18] count God wants
[1:25:20] communion God wants
[1:25:23] Fellowship we can go to church too much
[1:25:26] you can read your Bible too much you
[1:25:28] cannot pray enough you can't pray too
[1:25:31] much you cannot take and show God that
[1:25:35] you're sacrificing your life showing him
[1:25:37] that he means more to you than you mean
[1:25:40] to
[1:25:41] you and God wants to see that I believe
[1:25:45] with all my heart I don't believe he
[1:25:46] wants to have to put you on your back
[1:25:50] with sickness or troubles or situations
[1:25:53] to get you to finally
[1:25:55] pray it's sad but that's the most time
[1:25:57] when we pray is when life's not going
[1:26:00] the way I wanted it to go and when it
[1:26:02] gets so bad then you realize Lord I got
[1:26:05] to call you on the scene and you know
[1:26:07] what he will and he'll solve the problem
[1:26:10] he'll heal your body he'll raise you up
[1:26:14] and then you go right on off into doing
[1:26:16] what you want to do all the
[1:26:17] time I don't believe this is a club
[1:26:20] everybody I don't believe this is a
[1:26:22] lodge I don't believe we're doing this
[1:26:23] for fun
[1:26:25] I ain't coming here for fun I ain't
[1:26:27] coming here just because I like the
[1:26:28] fellowship I'm coming here to get cut
[1:26:31] judged searched my heart I'm coming here
[1:26:34] to be molded and shaped into his very
[1:26:36] image CU that is my heart's desire and I
[1:26:39] fail him so very much but my absolute
[1:26:42] desire and I know it's my desire is to
[1:26:45] be just like him to be a bride that he'd
[1:26:47] be pleased with that one he would say oh
[1:26:50] I love her I love her and I know she
[1:26:53] loves me
[1:26:54] I know it I know it because she was
[1:26:57] willing to give up everything to be with
[1:27:00] me why don't you
[1:27:04] stand musicians
[1:27:12] come got 15 minutes before
[1:27:16] 9
[1:27:18] and if you don't mind musicians maybe
[1:27:20] you just play something
[1:27:22] softly when you come up
[1:27:25] but I asked the kids I said you know a
[1:27:28] really good way to know where you're at
[1:27:31] when you pray how do you
[1:27:35] pray if you when you go to prayer you're
[1:27:38] always praying for God to do something
[1:27:40] for you I have a question then who is
[1:27:44] serving
[1:27:46] who does God exist to serve you or are
[1:27:49] you living to serve
[1:27:51] him because brother bham said prayer is
[1:27:54] getting yourself out of the way stop
[1:27:58] thinking of yourself so much stop saying
[1:28:02] Lord solved this problem I'm
[1:28:04] suffering that's not how you're supposed
[1:28:07] to pray do you know that Our Father
[1:28:09] which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name
[1:28:12] thy kingdom come thy will be done on
[1:28:15] Earth as it is in heaven give us this 10
[1:28:21] years give us this day our our daily
[1:28:24] bread and forgive us of our trespasses
[1:28:27] as you as we forgive one another and
[1:28:29] lead us not into temptation but what
[1:28:31] Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the
[1:28:34] kingdom the power and the glory forever
[1:28:36] and ever that's how your lord responded
[1:28:39] when they were ask Lord how shall we
[1:28:42] pray that was his will you trust him you
[1:28:45] look to him for everything every single
[1:28:50] day but the effects of this culture has
[1:28:53] certainly caused our minds to be pulled
[1:28:56] away from what his desire and Will was
[1:28:58] for our
[1:29:00] lives
[1:29:03] musicians everyone God bless you I'm
[1:29:06] untraditional in how I do things I'm
[1:29:09] going to dismiss now and say you have 15
[1:29:12] minutes before
[1:29:13] 9: if you want to take that time and
[1:29:16] pray in your seat take that time and
[1:29:18] pray at the altar that's up to you but
[1:29:21] let me give you a suggestion maybe don't
[1:29:24] pray this time for
[1:29:26] yourself maybe pray this time for God's
[1:29:29] will for your life that you would see it
[1:29:31] more clearly understand what he's
[1:29:33] looking for out of you at this
[1:29:36] moment then maybe pray for somebody
[1:29:39] else stop praying for yourself so much
[1:29:43] start praying for somebody
[1:29:45] else and then I think we'll be getting
[1:29:48] in the condition of his
[1:29:51] bride God bless you your dis dismissed
[1:29:54] I'm going to hand it over to the
[1:29:56] Musicians being in prayer for brother
[1:29:58] Gabe we'll see him Sunday May the Lord
[1:30:00] bless him and brother Ben next Wednesday
[1:30:03] God bless you
