pray amen amen it's good to be with you amen we're so glad to be back and appreciate your prayers we had a absolutely wonderful time let's go and turn to the book of revelation while we're standing thank you musicians somebody said i'm sure you come back all filled i said no i come back empty and then another brother said we'll be pulling i said you better pull hard because you got to pull me back in gear i'm in neutral i've been coasting for two weeks so and that was the goal you know to go and just unwind and relax we had a wonderful time we had a good time with our family devotions and a good time just to rest and relax but brother branham said preaching is something you got to keep up with and he said one time he goes i've kind of got out of practice but i think he had been two or three months out of the pulpit i've been two weeks and i felt like i forgot i forgot everything friday i forgot how to prepare yesterday i was in desperation i forgot but we're trusting the lord amen it's not us it's him and we just yield to him and believe lord that he'll do what he promised that he'll do so i'm trusting in you to help pull me back in gear amen by the grace of god we appreciate you praying for us we had a lovely time some many people said yesterday they asked my family where we went i forgot i didn't tell everybody but we were in missouri in the ozark mountains in the middle of nowhere fishing in the middle of nowhere i was happy amen that's where we want to be away from all tourist sites away from population amen and we were we had a wonderful time together and i also want to appreciate the brothers who ministered here i've heard good reports about all of the services so we want to thank brother kyle brother ron and brother jean for their putting their shoulder to the wheel and helping out and i i was totally relaxed because i've got confidence in the brothers here i haven't even watched the services yet i just got back thursday night about 11 p.m and i'm hoping this week to get caught up but i've heard nothing but good reports so i'm thankful for that as well i also want to say thankful for the large group that showed up yesterday to help clean up the fellowship hall and finish up some of the kitchen remodel i was astonished at the progress that was made and many hands make light work that is a true statement and so we got a lot done we appreciate that and the kitchen remodel is almost done it's almost finished they really use sunday school rooms today the restrooms are open down there the fellowship hall is back in order so we're getting really close so thank you for all who helped with that man it's just good to be home it's good to be here together it's good to open our bibles together and read together and worship god together i mean there's something about that that we just can't get over amen and we just appreciate it so much and when you've been separated from it even just for four services you're just so excited to get back together again but i'd like to begin by reading here out of revelation chapter 17. to say god bless you brother tommy it was good to have you sing i always enjoy hearing you saying god's been so good to us we're thankful just to be here today god bless you brother aaron aaron lau is here he showed up right as i was leaving so i told him it was going to be a couple weeks before i got to greeting but we're happy that he's united again with his wife and they've finished the relocation and they're here together so god bless you it's good to have you here now let's read from revelation 17 verse 14. these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful you can have your seats we ask the lord to bless the reading of his word and i just want to read a quote out of the fourth seal referring to this and i just want to take note of the scripture again he says for the lamb shall overcome them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him so the lord is not alone in this battle when they come against the lamb the lamb is king of kings and lord of lords but he's not alone there are those that are with him and those that are with him are called and chosen and faithful and brother branham says in the fourth seal he says and he's got wrote life riding on a white horse and here's a man with three different powers mixed up called death gathering his earth-bound delegates and christ is gathering his heaven-born subjects amen are you a heaven-born subject men then christ is gathering you for this battle we know that before there's ever a physical battle there's a spiritual battle and the spiritual battle is raging right now christ is gathering as heaven-born subjects amen and we know that the the antichrist system is gathering its catholics and his protestants so this is not armies and tanks and horses there'll be a manifestation of that later but this gathering is a spiritual gathering the forces of the antichrist systems versus christ and his heaven-born subjects amen so he says these three different powers all mixed up called death gathering his earthbound delegates and christ is is heaven born subject saints he's got death role in him christ has got life wrote on him you pick that up in revelations 19 brother branham is taking revelations 19 and pulling it over here into this group this this coming uh group for the battle in uh revelation 17. so he's saying he's got life wrote on him those with him are on a white horse's also and they are called the chosen before the foundation of the world and they are faithful to the word amen he says i like that one called chosen before the foundation of the world and then faithful to the word by their choosing amen faithful to the word by their choosing that's what i want to focus on today is faithful to the word because we see that they were called amen and you know nobody called themselves god has called you and you didn't choose yourself god chose you before the foundation of the world but they were called chosen and faithful called by god chosen before the foundation of the world you have nothing to do with that that's all god's doing but the third part is faithful to the word by their choosing amen that's the part that we get to play amen that's our privilege in this day that's our privilege in the battle that's that's the privilege that god has given to us to be faithful to the word by our choosing amen it's a it's a wonderful privilege and we should never take it lightly amen and i think too many times we squander this great privilege away and we don't recognize what what god has called us to and what god has called us for and what our purpose in this life is and how god has put himself in partnership with man amen and so many times we as man we want god to do everything amen but brother branham over and over he says you're waiting on god he said god's waiting on you said you're waiting for the rapture the rapture is waiting on you amen he says those in hebrews 11 he said they're not made perfect without us so the brother man said he's waiting for this church to come to perfection amen what is perfection amen full maturity completion what what brings full maturity what is full maturity the restoration of the head to the body is the full body amen they're waiting for this church to come to perfection what will that be it's not it's not a perfect life like there's we've never done anything wrong that's not it that's not that's not the point i mean if we try to say we come to perfection by never making a mistake we're just going to get discouraged in our walk but that's not what it's about amen it's about coming to that perfect headship and coming to a perfect submission to that perfect headship because it's the capping off of that body amen there's a quote that brother branham goes to at the end of christ is the mystery of god revealed and he says hebrews 11 hebrews 11 we know to be the the hall of fame or the faith chapter of the bible and it begins with faith as the substance of things hoped for and without faith it's impossible to please god and then it goes through all the heroes of faith and then it and then it goes towards the end he says and they could not be perfect without us so brother is referencing hebrews 11 and in the quote he says hebrews 11 said they could not be perfect without us hands and feet cannot be perfect without the brains so what's he calling us [Music] and it's not well we're the smartest of all the church age and that's not what he's talking about let's keep reading amen he said he says uh the hands and the feet we know that he was coming up rebuilding this bride tree rebuilding his bride that had fallen in thyatira have fallen at the knights and council and bringing a restoration of the bride tree bringing his bride in a resurrection back to what she was intended to be at the beginning of virgin bride for christ and he restores through luther the feet amen through wesley the hands and then he comes back to the mouth amen to the manifestation of the gifts and speaking in tongues to the eyes to the prophet but there's got to be a finishing of capping off the brains the knowledge the mind of christ has got to come and cap off this church to bring it to perfection and so it's imperfect if it stops anywhere along this journey it's still not perfect and they are still waiting on us amen so he says the feet cannot be perfect without the brains the knowledge the head and so forth and we're all perfected in him so by one spirit we're all baptized into one body free from judgment passed from sin and death so brother abandonment is referring to hebrews 11 and they're not perfect without us because as the body come up it can't be it cannot be finished it cannot be completed until the headship comes and the headship comes and brings the mind of christ one is the mind of christ it is the full revelation of the entire bible that was sealed up by seven seals but when those seven seals were torn loose amen after the tearing loose of the seven seals it opened up the entire bible amen and it restored back to god's people the entire mind of god because it was the mystery of god revealed the mystery one mystery one goal one thing that god wanted to accomplish and all of the shadows and all the times and everything was showing it and it was sealed away behind those seals so we had to have seals that would be tore loose first to show the redemption of the church so when you would see the redemption of the church you can now see the whole mystery of god but nobody was worthy to loose those seals until a lamb come forth amen and when a lamb come forth he himself could loose the seals and when he loosed the seals amen he sent it to us and now we're eating the book amen and it's the headship coming to the body and it's to bring the mind which will be the capping off or the perfection of the church and so we have to remain faithful to that headship because that's our portion to play in this life that is our role we're not in hands we're not in feet we're not in mouth we're not even in eyes anymore amen we've gone beyond that into the full revelation the full manna from heaven the opening of the word the open book the mind of christ the mystery of god revealed the secret that god had in the back part of his mind has now been opened and brought into the church and we must remain faithful to that he says i'm going back to this quote in the fourth seal it says they are faithful to the word amen i like that one called chosen before the foundation of the world and faithful to the word by their choosing all stimulated with new wine and oil just riding right along coming down to meet him they know the thunders will issue the thin course pretty soon well the thunders have issued the thing because the preaching of the thunders amen was revealing of the seals the interpretation of the symbols of the seals is what the thunders were and the thunders amen opened it up so that we could open up the mystery of god so they have the mind of christ and if you have the mind of christ you have christ if you have the mind of god you have god because god was alone with his thoughts amen god was not a being that could be seen he was not material subject god was a i i don't want to say anything wrong because i there's things we don't understand so i don't want to use wrong terminology but in a very childish way if i could say it in a very immature childish way god was a mind he was his thoughts he was his will he was a person god was his thinking but he wanted his thoughts to become material he wanted himself to be moved down into a tangible form that could be seen that could be touched it could be found so god in his great thinking he had a great plan in his great person he he wanted more expression so he began to express in more tangible physical ways and in the heavenly realm and then into the earthly realm and god amen so when you go back to the secret that god had back then before he was god when he was elohim when he was the self-existing one when you go back to that thought you've gone back to god amen you you bypass amen so many things that are inferior so many expressions that still had humanity tied in so many uh so many expressions that were man-made and man-cultivated or man-perverted i should say and you go all the way back back amen even the heavenly realms were perverted even the angelic beings chose wrong amen even god had to redeem it all because it was fallen and you go back and you go back and you go back to the mystery the thought the desire that was in god's mind before the foundation of the world when you've got that thought you've got god and you've skipped past all of this and you've gone right back to his original heart's desire because the heart purpose of god was to have a bride of his own choosing and so we've been brought so far because god is trying to complete the masterpiece and he's got to cap it off and and he brings his his mind his headship the revealed word to the body and now now that is our focus that is our that's the age we live in that that is our calling that is our purpose this isn't feet age this isn't hands age amen this isn't mouth hey this is the age of the full revelation of the mystery of god being revealed in this day and that is what we're to be faithful to friends that is our headship that is our husband amen the revealed word brother branham speaks here in satan's eden he says what a beautiful place god was so satisfied until he just went back and rested from all his works every tree never brought forth thorns and thizzles no berries ever come off of a thorn tree everything was perfect all seeds were perfect everything was in perfect condition speaking here of the garden of eden then when he went to take a little rest his enemy slipped in with the seat and took it over by misinterpreting his program to his children when he put trust in his own child now think about this when when when god had completed amen the work of his masterpiece and he completed the setting that he was going to set the masterpiece in and he had a masterpiece sign and then out of his son come a masterpiece bride and he brought them together to make a masterpiece family and he set this masterpiece in the garden amen and he put trust in his son and his son's bride and so he went and took his rest because you know it god took his rest because god was now working through the manifestation of the son he had given it over to his son and his son's bride and now they were god upon the earth and they were administering amen and watching over and overseeing the creation of god and god put trust in his own child as you put trust in your daughter when she goes out at night with a man when you put trust in your son when he has to go with a drinking boy or a smoking boy see he put trust in his own son and he would not do anything wrong and would keep every word that he said but the enemy slipped in like that greasy slicker that would take out your daughter and misbehave himself or some woman would take go out with your son and say the same thing see he slipped in the enemy of god slipped in and misinterpreted the word to eve now he by his fall it has took over and possessed the garden of eden himself he took it over and down he has had six thousand years of deceitful rule deceiving the people god's children as he did then because they were based on free moral agency to act any way they wish to and believing that they would act right or trusting that they would act right then they've come with the wrong act and sold their birthright as esau did for the world and satan won it and took it over and he's had six thousand years to build up his eden as god had six thousand years to bring his eating to close and by deceit the seed of the word or the people now establish his own eden in the earth in sin so god brother was telling us that gone he entrusted his son he trusted his son with his word he trusted his son with his creation and he trusted him to do right and he gave him the word and he went to take his rest so that his son could be faithful to the word amen but we know that that bride was found unfaithful to the word and so when she was found unfaithful to the word then adam left the word to go with his wife amen so that he could redeem his wife and and now god the trust that he put in his son and his son's bride now that trust is violated and we know that this serves a greater purpose but it sets a principle that god had set up free moral agency a law of choosing and he never took that choice away because god wants choice our choice our faithfulness to express something amen and so we were called he did that chosen before the foundation he did that but faithful by our own choosing that's what he's asking us to do and he was asking his son the first time to do it knowing what would happen but he still put him on free and moral agency and asked him to do it and listen lucifer made his choice he chose rebellion the angels made their choice they chose to follow him the jews made their choice to choose law over grace and god gave them their choice amen the church chose creeds of man over the word of god amen god has never taken away this choice amen and you think why wouldn't you stop this amen why wouldn't you just take it all away and and scrub it all and then just just rule like a dictator and have it all right because god is expressing something and he wants it to be expressed and he set it up on free choice and he's not changing the rules of the game after he started the game so the game has to play out according to the rules amen and there was a rule established of free choice and that rule was expressed in heaven and caused the fall it was expressed in eden and caused the fall it was expressed at sinai and caused the law it was expressed in nicaea and caused the fall of the church but god has foresaw that he will have a portion of himself attributes that will come to the mind of christ and they will not fall but they will be faithful by their own choosing he's predestinated to be that way he's chosen he's elected and he's placed attributes amen in the earth today and he's given the attributes what the attributes before hadn't had amen the attributes that came before us friends had partial revelation had pieces of the story the attributes that went before us were part of of the developing amen of the word of god of the bible as we know it they were there playing out their part they were acting out their role they were demonstrating a certain portion of the gospel story but they didn't have the privilege you and i have of sitting here after the opening of the seals amen when the mystery of god has been revealed and you look back and the whole thing has been peeled open the veil has been taken away and you can look back and see that before amen before there was a creation god had in his mind a plan and that plan god was going to express himself and it was the very god becoming tangible it was the very god coming into existence amen to have manifestation with his attributes and according to that god had an adversary because the adversary would demonstrate his attributes and he allowed a law of free moral agency and choosing amen so that the adversary had room to work and when the adversary had room to work that working would create situations where attributes could come out into expression and when those attributes come out into expression it was displaying god here and god here and god here and god here so that as god was becoming tangible he was becoming known he was becoming expressed amen he didn't just show up tangible poof amen now worship me but he was coming in a way that you would see his character that you would see as nature that you would see him as a deliverer and a healer and a father and all and a king and all of these attributes and you and i are sitting here amen at the end of the gentile dispensation amen at the end of the church ages amen having the seals taken off of the mystery of redemption and looking at the mystery of god that is now being revealed to the bride and you have the benefit of all of that moses the bible said was faithful in all his house but moses yet had failure at the smitten rock david was faithful to do all god's will but yet david failed there was choices made choices that that caused failure but all of these attributes were operating in a certain portion of the mystery and a certain manifestation for their day but now we're not here in partial friends we're not here wondering about things that the prophets and sages of old would love to have understood and known that were probed at that that they saw in vision form or they they saw in symbolic form but now we're here in the actual revelation the actual literal manifestation of what they were looking at in symbol form what they were seeing is symbols amen what they were seeing is symbols in ezekiel's dry bones amen that bride is standing on her feet after prophecy had gone forth amen and the spirit of god came when the word of god came to set her forth as a marching mighty army marching to zion they saw it in the symbol they saw it in a vision but we're living the reality and this is what we have to be faithful to brother ben said in choosing of a bride so there's another choice that we have in life that's a life's companion a young man or young woman stepping out in life has been given a right to make a choice the young man chooses the young woman has a right to accept or reject it but it's still a choice on both sides both man and woman they have a right to choice also you have a choice as a christian you have a choice of the church here in america so far that you can go to that's your own american privilege to choose any church that you want to belong to that's a choice you don't have to go in any of them if you don't want to but if you want to change from methodist to baptist or catholics to protestants or so forth there's nobody can tell you or make you come to any certain church that's our freedom that's what our democracy is every man can choose for himself freedom of religion and that's a great thing god help us to keep it as long as we can you have also a choice when you choose this church you can choose whether in this church whether you will choose a church that will guide you to your eternal destination you can choose a church that has a certain creed that you might think that that crete is just what you want or another church has a their creed and then there's a word of god you have a choice of you have to make the choice there's an unwritten law among us of choosing this is what i want to focus on there is an honor and brother bam just goes through a few of them a spouse a church of the word you want to follow or a creed but he said there's a unwritten law among us of choosing he said i believe it was elijah one time up on mount carmel after the showdown and the great hour of the crisis that we're just about to come to right now perhaps it may be to you or i tonight that we make this choice like the mount carmel experience frankly i think it's going on worldwide now but there will soon be a time where that you'll have to make a choice the brotherhood was establishing and choosing a bride this law of god this unwritten law among us of choosing and any any cites first kings 18 let's just turn there together first kings 18. first kings 18 and 21 and elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt you between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but have failed and follow him and to be able to answer him not a word so here in the in the mount carmel showdown where elijah is restoring the the proper form of worship he's rebuilding the altar that was tore down he's bringing them to a showdown and he's asking them how long will you haul between two opinions he's saying now you're it's time to make a choice you can't just have everything right amen and brother ben said frankly i think it's going on worldwide he said it might be happening for you today but i frankly i think it's going worldwide but there's also coming a time where you're going to have to make a choice and i say don't wait for that day make the choice now will we have the world amen mixed with the message will we have old doctrines carried over from previous age mixed with the message or are we going to take the word and the word only the way a prophet gave it to us amen are we going to make a choice for the word and stay with the word regardless of whatever happens to us or what people think of us amen of separations and rejections and and hardships let's take the word and the word only and take it the way a prophet delivered it to us amen and so elijah's saying it wasn't that they rejected altogether jehovah it wasn't that they accepted altogether baal they were mixing the two together and elijah was standing against hybrid religion because the elijah in our day was standing against hybrid religion he built back the altar of sacrifice he built back the proper form of worship and in the time of the evening sacrifice he called on god and god supernaturally vindicated his ministry we've had a replica in our day and the replica in our day is calling us to make a choice it's not just god sent a prophet god god sent a prophet to call us to an attention that would this is not pleasing to jehovah this mixing of these ideas he doesn't want any more mixing this isn't the day of mixing this isn't the day of partial understanding this is the day of the restoration of the headship of christ the word has come back to the church and god wants a people that will be faithful by their own choosing amen he won't force you any more than they were forced in this day let's turn to joshua 24 because elijah is very much reiterating something that joshua had said joshua 24 and 15 and if it seems evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods that your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites and whose lands you dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord joshua brought them over and and brought them to a question now and bring him to a time of decision and he says now amen we're in the land amen we're going to possess this land and choose you this day whom you will serve it wasn't forced upon them friends it wasn't god god doesn't want it that way god wants choice because your choice will express what's in your heart god's leaving us with choice today he doesn't direct your every movement every day amen he doesn't take you and forcibly make you say uh something positive he doesn't forcefully make you confess the word you have to of yourself amen confess the word you have to speak positive confession of the word god doesn't take over your tongue and make you say that there's times god takes over his children's tongue and speaks things that they have no knowledge of but that's not what we're talking about today we're talking about god allowing room for you to make your choice to prove that you're faithful by your own choosing because those are the people that are following him in this battle they're the ones who are faithful by their own choosing and now joshua is saying you've gotten all kinds of gods that you picked up in egypt all kinds of different deities you picked up in egypt and along the way picked up in the feast of bail pior you you picked it up from the you picked it up through the moabites he says but choose you this day whom you're going to serve this or that there's an unwritten law among us of choosing and god has left it that way and god is going to defeat the devil in this day with the people who are called chosen before the foundation of the world and faithful by their own choosing and brother bam said faithful to the word by their own choosing you can be faithful to a lot of things and you can miss the word you can be faithful to your church and miss the word you can be faithful to your ministry and miss the church you can be faithful to your family and not miss the church miss the word you can be faithful to your family and miss the word you know remember the apostle paul when he's standing before agrippa he says now everybody knows from i was brought up in jerusalem at the feet of gamalio and after the strictest sect of the pharisees i was and i even persecuted this way hauling men and women to prison and my voice stood against them when they were put to death paul was faithful to the traditions of his fathers but being faithful to the traditions of his fathers he was persecuting jesus christ it wasn't that paul wasn't faithful paul was faithful to the wrong thing and after his conversion he became faithful to the word amen and when he was faithful to the word he was rejected by everything else that he was faithful to before and he lost allegiances and he lost friendships and he lost associations amen even in the christian church he lost his associations because he was faithful to that word amen and when he become faithful to the word he rejected everything else that he had been faithful to before and counted it as dung [Applause] the jews were so faithful and zealous for the traditions of the fathers amen that they began to deny the very fundamental principles of the word even jesus says you tithe in minton anderson and these things but you leave the principles of the word mercy and justice and faith and here they're so zealous over the traditions of the fathers that they will bribe contrary to the word that they will lie contrary to the word and they will murder contrary to the word and you see they weren't faithful to the word they were faithful to the traditions of the fathers and so we have to be careful what we're faithful to because brother brahma said this group that's following him on white horses in another place he says not exactly horses remember the book of revelation is a book of symbols amen they were writing on the word amen the power of the word was carrying them in this battle amen and now those who are following after them amen are faithful to the word by their choosing not by force not by coercion not by group mentality but by their own individual choosing they are faithful to the word brother abraham says in the messing choosing of a bride he says christ does vindicates his word which attracts the people so what attracts the people the vindication of the word of god it attracts the people he don't attract the people at churches that are attracted by big denominations and big doings and great big carrying ons and fancy things but the word of god attracts the bride of christ so god has a way of attracting his bride and the attraction of the bride is to the word of god and god vindicates it to get the people's attention and he attracts his bride by the word of god then further down a couple paragraphs later he says while the true bride attracts the attention of god so god has already attracted her attention by vindicating his word and that she's attracted to the word listen she's not just attracted to the vindication the vindication was to vindicate the word she's attracted to the word the vindication got her attention amen and showed her that this is god and remember she's attracted to the word god attracts his bride by the word now the bride attracts the attention of god amen how many want to attract the attention of god he's got my attention now i want to get his attention he said the true bride attracts the attention of god by keeping his word oh what can i do what can i do for god don't go build something don't go work something up just keep his word be faithful to the word by your own choosing and that attracts his attention oh he loves that how god is looking for that how god has been longing for that how god in his mind has been working to this goal all the way through from the fallen eden he's been building back a masterpiece he's wanted a bride of his own choosing that's his heart's desire and everything has been building to this climax to have a people who are faithful to the word by their own choosing so he restored the word to us so that we could be faithful to the word because there was men of old who went before us that were faithful to their portion of the word and they are part of that bride part of that body will be part of that resurrection amen and part of the bride of jesus christ they're not different than we are they're the same but they were living in portion and they got a hold of the portion of the word and they were faithful by their own choosing to that portion amen but this isn't that day now the full word's been given and just as faithful as they were to their portion we must be faithful to the whole they did their part it's time for us to do our part because as they were building the feet and the legs and the hands and the arms amen they were doing their part in the partial accepting the word for their day when it came to light they followed the light and walked in the light amen as much as it was revealed to them forsaking all others and cleaving only to that portion of the word that was given to them in that day but that's not this day and they without us are yet made perfect even more than the hands and the feet are not perfect without the brains the knowledge the head shoot and the headship has come into the bride it's in her it's part of her she's become one with the head so the bride attracts the attention of god by keeping his word we can try ever so many things to attract god's attention faithfulness to church church attendance works programs all kinds of things but the thing that gets his attention is when you buy your own choosing keep his word when you're given a choice and you choose the word that gets his attention and we see that as we journey through life we hit obstacles struggles difficult situations things that are complicated and confusing and i hope i'm not the only one who hits those areas but all that is is an opportunity for you to make your choice and that sometimes in the beginning it's not evident what choice i should make it becomes so complicated sometimes it's so complex these situations i i'm one who likes black and white i've told my wife many times if god would send me a letter in the mail say chad do x y z i would do x y z i don't care what it says cause i like rules i like guaranteed things i don't like taking chances or risks but that's not what god wants amen god wants you to make your choice and it lets you get in complicated situations difficult things to discern things that aren't obvious and don't make obvious sense it's not black and white it's not easily i can choose this and easily i can choose that you get into a situation where you've got to labor and go and say god show me in your word what you want and as god begins to reveal through the message through your bible through prayer time through the preaching of the gospel amen all of a sudden something clicks and you know this is the right word for this situation and you by your own choosing choose the word amen and it came so complicated and it came in such a way that nobody can make an easy answer that you would be justified with either choice you could be justified with either choice this looks good and this looks good and half may be for this this isn't half the people and you can't even get counsel because nobody has the answer why do we get in those situations why does it seem like we get in those situations more often because god wants a people who are faithful by their own choosing and it's it's so it's such a situation where you could choose your own desire and nobody would fault you but only you and god would know that's what you wanted and nobody would fault you because this is how these decisions are coming now and so you could hide your selfish decision from every brother or sister that's around you and your choice wasn't for him your choice was for you see this is how close it's coming he wants a people that'll choose the word of their own choosing not because everybody in the church would reject me i would look bad uh nobody would understand that's not what god wants this is no longer a group walk this is no longer a system this is no longer a man of people who are moving together this is one individual moving in obedience to god these are individuals choosing the word by their own choosing not groups of people choosing the word by their own choosing that's why if you remain faithful to your church you can become unfaithful to the word and no matter how faithful you are than to the church it doesn't matter because you've been unfaithful to the word now if you're faithful to the word you'll also be faithful to the group of people he calls you to assemble with because that's still obedience to the word that's how it's a it's a razor's edge it's such a tight walk amen that the bride is getting herself into now you can't reject the word we must be in fellowship we must be a contributor brother branham said put your shoulder to the wheel be there every time the doors are open show your support for the church but you can do that and reject the word and be wrong we do that because it is the word and it's my choice to follow the word so i'm a supporter of the church i put my shoulder to the wheel i come when the doors are open and not to look good not because people would judge me not not to get not faithfulness to the church it's my faithfulness to the word that causes me to do that it's my faithfulness to the word that causes me to to to pay my tithe to be honest in my dealings at work to be to be honest with my family and kind and gentle and leading my it's my faithfulness to the word not my faithfulness to the church friends family pastors preachers we have to be careful what we're faithful and allegiant to too many times in in the denominational mentality faithfulness to the church and faithfulness to the ministry equaled faithfulness to god but what happened in every denominational system every age amen that that church and that group of men begin to steer away from the word and your faithfulness to the word made you un your faithfulness to the church made you unfaithful to the word even though there was nothing wrong with faithfulness to the church it was part of the word but we have to be careful what we're faithful to and why we're faithful to that brother bam says in the marriage of the lamb so many says if the lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing i'll serve him but that's up to you boy we're getting into some serious stuff now you've got to do something they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down she has made herself ready i like that word he's going right to revelation and saying the bride has made herself ready and the terminology is the bride has made herself ready you say now how could she make herself ready how could we ever get ready without god how could we ever do anything without god we can't do anything without god how can we make ourselves ready it sounds like works it sounds like our own effort and our own labor but it's in the scriptures but she had to make herself ready the same way esther made herself ready and how did master make herself ready esther took the things that were appointed unto her and put them on amen she admitted and submitted herself to the leadership she was under under haggai amen she submitted herself into what haggy i had appointed amen but she had to actually take it on and put it on herself she had to submit she had the yield she had to lose her own mind amen every maiden when it was her time to go to the king she was given whatsoever she desired to go in before the king but when esther came she took only what was appointed by haggai so esther made herself ready but esther didn't make herself ready by herself esther had a a a esther had an appointed chamberlain esther had a haggy eye that would show her the way she was given things for her purification she was given clothing to wear everything was given by the king for her but she had to recognize it yield to it submit to it put it on and go the way she was instructed to go so the bride has made herself ready the same way esther made herself ready not with her own ideas not with their own programs not with their own works but submission to the leadership gave us that god gave us in this day there's been a chamberlain and pointed to the women in this day to the bride and he knows what the king wants and there's been word appointed to the bride clothing that the bride has clothed and there's been there's a bit been a purification offered to the bride under the washing of the water of the word but brother abraham said if you won't stay under the word how are you going to be washed he's given the pure word for washing but if you won't stay under the word how will you be washed you have to make yourself ready by staying under the word you can't bring the word of purification you can't create a pure condition yourself but you must submit to the washing of the water of the word this is brian and that's why brother ben says they that overcome shall inherit all things he's also taking that out of the scriptures she has made herself ready i like that word you see god can't push us through a little pipe pull us out the other end and then saying blessed is he that overcometh brother branham's saying the language doesn't even make sense god can't push you in a little pipe pull you out the other end and say blessed is he that overcometh you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make a decision for yourself i have to make a decision for myself in doing that we show our faith and respects to god abraham was promised a child but he must maintain that promise for 25 years the ups and downs that he had the temptations in those 25 years but he held to the word of the promise and israel was promised the promised land but they had to fight for every inch of it wherever the souls of your foot treads upon that have i given you god said to joshua it was all there the land was there and god gave it to them but they must fight for it the same way it is about divine healing god has given the power to heal you if you've got the courage to accept it but you will fight every inch of the way god has got amazing grace to save you and he will do it but you'll fight every inch of your way i've been behind the pulpit going on 31 years and i've every inch of that has been a fight constantly it certainly has but we must fight if we must reign so we find out that the that the bride has to make herself ready be willing to lay aside every weight and and that does so easily beset us this is what paul says paul's telling us to run the patient run the race with patient you have a race to run he says run it with patience laying aside that's you doing it laying aside every sin and weight that this will easily beset us what is weighing us down what is hindering us what is holding us from running this race effectively efficiently with all of our heart he paul is telling us to lay it down we're not saying god if you'll rip this out of my hands i'll serve you we would never stand in front of people do that but that's exactly what's happening in our hearts we don't want to lay it down we just want god to take it away from us but we don't want to lay it down we still want it but we want god to take it what we need to do is realize it's hindering us and begin to hate that thing instead of love it begin to see it in the negative context it's in and it doesn't have to be a negative thing to be negative it doesn't have to be a negative thing to be negative amen but it's a weight that does so easily beside us and we must cast it away it says being willing to lay aside every weight that does so easily beside us that we might run with patience the race that is set before us we must lay them aside ourselves we can't say god you come lay them aside for us we got to do that ourselves i'm so glad the prophet of god said that because if he hadn't i would have no justification for saying that but he's teaching us a principle that they are called chosen before the foundation of the world and faithful to the word by their own choosing there are things we have to choose and if we if we choose and overcome then we get the overcomers reward but if god did it all for us we get no overcomers reward because we're not an overcomer there is nothing to overcome but when god leaves us something to overcome you say why am i in this why am i struggling with that do you realize what the rewards are for the overcomers god is leaving something for you and i to overcome by our own choosing to stick with the word and believe god and overcome these things because there's tremendous rewards for the overcomers let's go to revelation 21 this is the scripture that brother brennan refers to in the quote that we just read right in the beginning of the quote revelations 21 and verse 7 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i always be his god and he shall be my son this is the scripture he's referring to he that overcometh shall inherit all things let's go back to revelation 2 and go through the church ages in every church age was given a reward to the overcomer so this reward for overcoming is not just for us every church age would get a reward for overcoming in their day but brother m tells us all the rewards are to all the believers revelations two and seven he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god this is for the overcomer this is for the one who will lay aside every sin and wait that thus so easily beset us these are for those who will lay aside relationships jobs anything that would hinder to run this race those who would lay it down freely of their own free choice without force and choose the word first this is their reward verse 11 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death verse 17 he that hath an ear let him hear with the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh what i give to eat of the hidden manna and we'll give them a white stone and then the stone a new name written which no man knoweth save he that receiveth it verse 26 and he that overcometh and keepeth my words works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and as a vessel of the potter shall they be broken to shivers even as i receive to my father chapter 3 verse 5 and he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and before his angels verse 12 he that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will i will write upon him the name of my god in the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name verse 21 lay of the sea and age the hymn that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame in him set down with my father in his throne those are the rewards to the believers to the gentile bride but those rewards only come to the overcomers and god has left us in situations where we have to make choices now god it's not as though god doesn't have any foreknowledge it's not that he doesn't know that we'll make the right choice if not that he doesn't know what's in us he knows he knew job would make the right choice before he put job to the test but he put job to the test because job had to make that choice of his own free choice job had to choose job had to speak job had to stay with the word job had to repent job had to confess see god is on partnership with man there's some things that have to be expressed through these attributes there's things there's victories that have to be won through these attributes that are now vesseled in vessels of clay and there's things that that have that we have to do and it's not that it's escaped god's foreknowledge that will do them god knows amen he knows that all things work together for the good god knows that we will make the right choice amen but god still has to set it up god still has to leave the circumstances such where we have to make a choice without control we have to stand like on mount carmel choose you this day if there will be god serve him if jehovah would be god's servant we have to stand like before joshua choose you this day whom you will serve are you going to serve yourself and your lust are you going to serve god the word are you going to serve a tradition that's come down from your family are you going to serve the word as it's being revealed are you going to serve your church are you going to serve christ god gives us a choice we have to take our choice and when we make our choice we're expressing our love and respects to god and god has set the circumstances such and he set it up this way that he is not violating free moral agency if god forced you to make the choice and forced you to do a certain thing then there's no such thing as free choice there's no such thing as free moral agency he can't force it he sets the circumstances and gives the word and sees what you will do and that's part of god's program brother branham said god has so fixed this program that he cannot move without you and i said what he said he said as long as we're not doing what god what the spirit is leading us to do we're paralyzing god's program why did god do it that way i'm not exactly sure but one thing i'm sure of is he did it that way that's part of the way that this whole plan of redemption and this whole victory over evil and this whole reconciling heaven and earth and all has something to do with that why it's that way i don't know but it all ties in together this is the way god set it up so it must be the right way because god doesn't do anything wrong he does it right and god wants us to make our choice in the marriage of the lamb 1962 the prophet said oh how that would do for a real christian to get away from the things of the world and someday you talk about coming into porn on the wings of a dove he's coming for a bride one that don't fool with the world or the things of the world she is washed in the blood of the lamb she has pledged her love to him only the love of the world is gone and dead to her the marriage of the lamb has come and the bride has made herself ready in the breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals he says now of course when adam fell to death he brought death upon all creation now he was given free moral agency it was given to them just as uh as we so to make a choice now adam and eve in the beginning there was a tree of right and wrong before them that same tree sets before each and every one of us see god isn't doing for adam or eve you say well it's their fault no now it's your fault you hear what he said no now it isn't it's your fault you can't place it on adam now you got to place it on yourself because right and wrong is set before you we are on the same basis as adam and eve but you see when we are redeemed we are no more one our own choice but we want his choice see now adam and eve wanted their own choice they wanted they wanted to find out what it was to have wisdom so they probed into it and it caused death now when a man's been redeemed he don't care anymore for scholarship he don't care anymore for the things of the world the wisdom of the world he don't want no choice at all christ has been his choice and that's all of it he's redeemed he's just no more wants to lead himself he don't want nobody to talk him into where to go and what to do he just waits and finds out the choice of his maker then he goes into the goes in the name of the maker then the maker when the maker tells him to go so now he says brother i'm talking about this one who makes their choice they don't want anybody else to tell them what to do or give them any other leadership no more man's leadership they wait on their maker amen until they hear from god and god always speaks through his word amen and when they see the word and god reveals the word to them amen they choose the word and they go forth in the name of their maker that's what god has asked her friends god's after it and you he's after it and me he's after it from the youngest to the oldest that's what god is looking for god this is brother man made it clear this is not the day of the group this is the day of the individual god is coming after one one individual and when god begins to speak of the rapture or when jesus christ begins to speak of it he said there'll be two lying in the bed one will be taken one will be left he's coming to the individual age and this is the rapture age this is the day of the individual one will be taken one will be left in the bend two will be grinding at the meal one will be taken one will be left in the bed that's this day friends we are in the rapture age the rapture h started with a shout because the lord himself descend with a shout with the voice amen and we're living in this day of the rapture when god is separating two laying in the bed one taken one left behind one's caught up into the revelation one is staying in laodicea one is going to chur they're both going to church one is in heavenly places and one is in carnal places going to the same church this is individual walk this is you and god and god is looking for you to make your choice not because so-and-so chose that i can choose it not because they did it i can do it that day's done that's over with it's finished well my church accepts this and my church accepts that it doesn't matter what your church accepts it matters what christ accepts from you and what christ accepts from you may be different than what he accepts from the whole the rest of the church that you attend with see that has created deception the group thing has been the formation of deception all the way through the church ages but god has ripped the veil of the systems and he's ripped the veil of denominationalism and religion and he's brought it back to one individual like job like abraham like like isaac like jacob when god started dealing with jacob he deal with jacob when jacob was all alone god began to deal with him when jacob was separated from everybody else god began to deal with him god has brought us back to individual god dealing with the individual so don't let the devil pull you back into a group this family allows it will allow it our church doesn't teach against it must be okay this brother said that and don't do that friends that's not the day we live in amen when you stand before the judgment seat of for rewards i'm not talking about uh uh i don't believe any of the bride will have to stand in judgment she's bypass judgment but in the judgment of rewards you'll be rewarded for what you do not for what you followed the leader for what you did for the choices you made for the the the word that you chose to follow when nobody else would follow it for the word that you believed when nobody else believed it god wants us to make our choice sometimes he'll ask you to make a choice that nobody else will understand but you're still responsible for that choice doesn't matter if you can make everybody understand it or not understand it you're still responsible for that choice i want to look at romans 11. there's just a something i just want to share i came across this while i was studying it and i want to just add this in because i think it's pertinent where we are romans chapter 11 11-29 romans 11 29 for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance brother teaches us this and and he goes into it quite a bit but we understand this scripture but the reason i say this is i want to say we have to be faithful with our gifts brother branham said in the message 1950 the message the angel in the commission he says look but here the only place that i can see in the bible where the program of god was ever broke and all in all the types was right here when moses smote the rock the second time to bring water out of the wa to bring out water regardless if it wasn't god's will he knew we know it wasn't god's will we'll admit to that don't we but moses had power to bring it whether it was god's will or not is that true we know it was against god's will because god told him to speak to the rock god's perfect will would speak to the rock and he didn't speak it he got angry with the people and and god said he exalted himself he said must i fetch water for you rebellious and stiff-necked people and in anger he smote the rock and water came out of the rock but god told him to speak to it but in his anger and frustration and his self-will he smote it and in smiting it god says you were exalting yourself because he says must i fetch water who was given the water but moses now frustrated with the people acts like he's the one giving the water and it appears that way because when he smites the rock water comes out but there's no way water would come out unless god allowed it so there's a paradox going on here and brother branham's going to explain the paradox he says we know it was against god's will but god had entrusted his servant with that power when he smote the rock and bring forth its water showed it wasn't god's will he smoted again he called for it it had to come that's right he was endowed with that power he brought forth water it was against god's will and god dealt with moses later about it god because of that didn't allow him to go into the promised land so he was he was rebuked and punished for that he said you remember elisha young fellow went ball-headed was young when he was young man some little children began to holler on bald head old bald head why don't you go up with elijah remember that that angered prophet now turned around angry and cursed those children in the name of the lord and two she-bears run out of the woods and killed 42 little innocent children is that right that's not the nature of the holy spirit you know that but that prophet was angry see you have to be careful what you do again he says in 1951 the works that i do bear witness of me says notice now moses smote the rock second time representing that christ should come to earth and die again now he had power to bring forth the water out of the rock whether it was god's will or not did you know that everybody will admit that it wasn't god's will but moses done it anyhow he had power god entrusted him to be a prophet and he gave him those powers to do that and he found out that his servant failed him and he glorified himself instead of god and then what happened god dealt with moses then didn't he not the children with moses the holy spirit is given to a man and gifts are given to a man but you have to watch what you're doing with those divine gifts god gives to us gifts gifts of ministry gives a song singing instruments to play in offices we have gifted officers and deacons and trustees and we have teachers of gifted teachers and sunday school teachers and those who do bible studies we we have god entrusts us with gifts and the gifts and callings are without repentance but we have to be faithful in the administering of those gifts we have to do it god's way because you can take a gift and destroy somebody's life you can take a gift and lead people astray you can take a gift and twist up the word of god but we have to be careful that we're faithful to him with our gifts and not to ourselves our own desires that we don't uh react in a way to glorify ourselves amen you can you can sing a song you can write a song and sing a song to glorify god or you can write a song and sing a song to glorify yourself we've all seen that you've seen people that will sing for the edification of the body and for the glory of god and you know it hits it it hits the spot then you've seen people are up there for a show glorifying themselves we've all seen it we may have all been guilty of one of these things a time or two we're not beautiful perfect innocent people but you realize the gift god gave you that gift was not for you to exalt yourself the gift was not for you amen to administer any way you wanted to amen but but god has to be in control of that but the gifts and callings are without repentance it's god giving you a gift amen to write songs you can write songs whether they be for god or not and if god has given you a beautiful voice to sing out amen the truths of god the revelations of god amen just when you begin to glorify yourself you're not going to start croaking like a bullfrog you'll keep singing just beautiful and melodious as you ever did but now you're not doing it for him now you're doing it for you see we'll be held accountable for all these things because this is the day of the individual this is the day it doesn't matter what anybody else does i mean it matters these things affect us and we affect one another but that's not what i'm worried about i'm worried about bringing this guy into subjection i'm worried about my motive and my objective being pure i'm motive about i'm interested in laying before the presence of god till i know his will and i know what he wants me to say and i know the way he wants me to say it and anytime i feel like it was too much chad and not him i go back on my face say god forgive me i shouldn't have said it that way and god help me to say it the way you want it said and protect me and guard my mouth and guard my i mean it puts you under tension when you say i want god's way not my way because you can still have a gift he's not going to take away the gift and the gift will still operate just as much as moses had power to strike that rock and bring water out of it even though god didn't tell him to god told him to speak to it but god honored his office in elijah when he called a curse upon those children it wasn't the nature of the holy spirit it wasn't the nature of christ brother ben tells us somewhere else but god honored his office because he had a gift he was a prophet and god honored his words and we have to be faithful to god with our gifts there's there's there's individuals who are just gifted at breaking the word gifted even in fellowship at teaching one another but we got to be careful that we don't misuse that and lead somebody in the wrong direction we there's some people who are who are really good at rallying people together getting a group together and let's do this project and let's do this for brother so and so and they're really they're really good at organizing really good administrations administrations is one of the gifts of the body but you can be administering something in your own desire and your own thinking and leading people into a program or leading in people into something that has nothing to do with what god wants and you're operating in a gift of administration or helps or teachings god's bringing it back to the individual say god i know you've given me this gift but what do you want done with it god i know you've called me to this and you've commented that and i know i hold this office and i know i have this work to do and i know i have a certain level of influence but god let it be you and not me make my motive and my objective pure i don't think we could pray enough i i don't know that i don't know that as deceitful as the age we live in and as as corrupted as the all the systems of the world are i don't believe that we can navigate this life without real sincere time in prayer to check our motives and to hear from god we can't bulldoze our way through this life anymore it's too treacherous it's too tricky the deception's all around us and the guy we're wrestling with is the guy you look in the mirror and you can't trust him to always get the right signal from what's going on around him he's got the you've got to have time to connect with god and say god what do i do about this situation what do i do about this situation how would i minister this word how do i sing this song how what do you want oh god we have to be careful elisha was a prophet of god but 42 children died because he was angry god didn't take away his gift god didn't stop honoring his word but it wasn't the nature of the holy spirit i say god help us not to do anything for vain glory it'll bring death help us not to minister out of anger help us not to sing for glory help us not to minister to share to to administrate to lead to to operate out of pride because it'll bring death but lord may we bring everything you've given to us and lay it back at your feet and say god if i'm left to do this by myself i will get it wrong and if i always do it just according to the way i feel i will get it wrong but god i'm taking this gift you've given to me and i'm laying it at your feet and i'm saying god will you by your power of your holy ghost administer this gift through me i choose to yield to you this is not the time to just keep trucking forward i think each step matters every decision matters because our decision shows our respect and honor to god when we decide where we're going to work and what hours will work and when we decide uh who we're going to associate with when we decide what we'll say and what we'll not say when we make decisions for where we'll go and not go amen those decisions show our respect and honor for god i think i think if god is looking for a host that will follow him who are faithful by their own choosing i say god i want to be one of those that are faithful by my own choosing you've given me choice and you've given me situations where i have to make a choice and may my choice reflect your will and may my choice reflect your word all the time and no doubt we won't always make the right choice but brother bennett said that's what the holy ghost is given for to bring you into correction quickly you may not always judge yourself correctly there's many times i had convinced myself that what i was doing was purely unselfish just for god just for other people and i had deceived myself and later when the whole thing unfolds i looked back and i said that wasn't pure there was me mixed into that i there was something i wanted i wanted to accomplish something i wanted to do something i wanted that privilege it wasn't pure although deep in my heart i would have known it wasn't purified i had taken the time to pray but i just got enough facts lined up to do what i wanted i don't believe i'm the only one sometimes you look back and you say god that was wrong but that's what the holy ghost is for friends to bring you into a quick repentance to acknowledge that that wasn't pure my motives weren't genuine i wasn't completely pure and all that i did remember brother branham says amen your thoughts speak louder than your words in heaven and brother brenham said what matters is motive and objective you may be able to string together a plausible cause better than a lawyer but god knows your motive and objective god knows the reason behind the reason behind the reason and he knows what was for him and he knows what was for you and he's looking for a bride that will yield completely to him to say and you'll make mistakes i make mistakes i make mistakes daily but can come back and be honest and say god that was selfish i said it selfishly i acted that way so that was for me god forgive me for that and let me follow your way because i want to be faithful by my own choosing not because somebody caught me or somebody questioned me or nobody may ever even know but i want to be faithful by my own choosing not because somebody's watching because there's always one person watching and that's the only person i want to please it's the master it's the master on the balcony remember brother ben tells the story of the man who studied under a master to play the instrument i don't remember what it was i think it was a violin and he and he studied and he studied and he played and he played a piece uh an orchestra piece and he played it before a a whole a theater of people and and he played it beautifully and he played it perfectly and people were in tears and they were weeping as he played they never heard music like that and when he was done playing the place erupted in applause and the man never reacted he didn't react at their applause he didn't react at his own efforts of course he would have known that he played it well of course he would have known that he got the parts right and of course he could hear the cheering of the people and the clapping and the praise but he looked to one on the balcony and the one was the master who had instructed him and he wouldn't smile he wouldn't feel relief he wouldn't exhale until he saw the master give a nod and begin to clap and then he knew he had pleased the master i said god help me live my life so i'm looking at the balcony amen not the praises of man not the criticism man not the accolades of men not what everybody else is doing or how they play their part but i want to play my part according to the way the master has designed for me to play my part and the only person i want to please in that life is him i want other people to like me i want other people to love me i love other people i want people to respect me but if everybody hates me if he loves me that's all that matters paul got to the place where he said all men has forsaken me but he knew god had never forsaken him and he hadn't forsaken god let's go to john 21. i'm telling you friends this is a different day we live in this isn't a church age for the bride the church ages are over this is a bride age this is a messianic age this is an abraham age this is a capstone age this is a different time for her we're not repeating the same things we've done before it's not group it's not churches it's individuals that god is calling to represent him upon the earth and he is coming in full measure to live in those individuals to express fully his bride that's the day we live in john 21 and 21. god had already told peter that peter's going to suffer he appeared to them at the sea of tiberias and he told peter that you're going to be when you're old you you'll be led away where you don't want to go and your hands will be outstretched and he basically told him you're going to suffer and you're going to die and then peter turns around and looks at john following after and he says in verse 21 peter seeing him sayeth to jesus lord and what shall this man do jesus saith to him if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee follow thou me what a lesson if i decide that he dwells here until i come and peter even misunderstood that he said what's that to thee follow thou me and that's the that's the call he's giving to each one of us today what is it to thee what happens to brother so-and-so what is it to thee what so-and-so is doing here or there what is that to thee what is it to thee if i've given them blessings what is it to thee if i've not withheld blessings what is that to thee follow thou me and who is he he is the word the headship that has been given this day and this bride will be faithful to that revealed word follow me forget everything else follow me peter was wanting to make sure john was going to get the same trouble he had you're going to be led away where you don't want to go your hands will be outstretched when you're old i mean it was nothing nice what about john if i bless him with abundant blessings what is that to thee if he has it easy and you have it hard what is that to thee if he gets everything and you get nothing what is that to thee follow thou me brother brett says in christ is the mystery of god revealed he says not say my church now my church has nothing to do with it it's an individual one person all hell is against this teaching all hell is against this truth but it is the truth i tell you what no matter how many people pat you on the back in this life they don't stand with you when you stand before god no matter how many people tell you you're right and no matter how many people and congratulate you on your abilities and your gifts and no matter how many people tell you what a wonderful person you are amen none of their voices matter none of it counts you know and if you're a gifted person you have to be careful because because when you operate when god operates through that gift it's a blessing to the people when the people express that they were blessed amen of course that feels good brother benham said it did you want to know that people were blessed you want to know that they appreciate it that they give thanksgiving but at the end of the day that doesn't matter the whole church can say i was blessed everybody can say that's nothing but the truth brother i believe every word you said brother chad but if it's wrong from what god said i'm wrong it doesn't matter if if we make a line and i go out the door and everybody pats you in the back and says that song you sang that was from heaven that was heavenly places but but in your heart you did it to be seen and to be glorified of yourself it matters not what anybody else says when you did something for somebody so that you could get credit for it when you get credit for it everybody tells you what a wonderful benevolent kind individual you are you have your reward that's as far as the reward goes but when you do it just for god of course appreciation is wonderful it makes you feel good you're thankful and it's right to express appreciation when somebody offers something to the lord it's a blessing to us we should show appreciation but at the end of the day all that matters is the master at the balcony did that action please him is that what he wanted is he satisfied will he give me the nod if he doesn't give me the not i failed doesn't matter how many people say you were wonderful you were great you were kind you were generous you were a blessing you sang like an angel it doesn't matter if the master's not satisfied i failed can we as individuals begin to live that way friends i think if we can begin to live that way we're going to finally come into what god wants for this age what he's been looking for all along he's been looking for somebody that will forsake it all and follow him for sake father mother daughter husband's wife lands and just follow him that's what this word has told us that's what christ himself has told us that he wants somebody that will forsake it all and choose him over everything else he said back in christ is the mystery of god revealed again all hell is against this truth but it is the truth jesus never said now peter you and john and all the rest of the people you've got the revelation now the whole church is saved no it was to him personally i say unto thee not to them to thee thou art peter upon this rock i'll build my church and the word peter means a stone stone means the confessed one or the separated one upon a certain stone upon a certain thing see a called out the church called out upon this stone upon this revelation flesh and blood never revealed it to you but upon this revelation called out group i'll build my church in them and all the gates of hell will never be able to withstand it not one hair of your head shall perish your mind i'll raise you up in the last day give unto him eternal life and raise him up at the last days there it is the revelation not them but him an individual not a group an individual all hell is against it that is nothing but the truth don't think it was just in brother branham's day that all hell was against this truth it's an individual god is showing us that in this day all hell is against this truth the individual not the group but his mystery is only revealed to his beloved bride that's the only one could see it and she is the only one can see it herself if you see it you can't make your neighbor see it this revelation is only revealed to his beloved bride she's the only one who can see it and the person who's dearest to you in all the world you can't make them see it the the child that you love more than anything you cannot make them see it the spouse who means more to you than anything else on this planet you cannot make them see it you have to see it as an individual it has to be an individual revelation of what god has done in this age and you have to see it for yourself let's go to acts 26. acts 26 and 13. this is paul testifying before agrippa and festus and he's he begins to explain to him his life story and what's going on and he says at midday o king i saw on the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining around about me and then which journeyed with me and when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voice speaking unto me saying in the hebrew tongue saul saul why persecute us down me it is hard for thee to kick against the bricks and i said who art thou lord he said i am jesus whom now persecutest but rise and stand upon thy feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou has seen and of those things in which i will appear unto thee delivering thee from the people and from the gentiles unto whom now i send thee to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan and to god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me whereupon o king agrippa i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision the apostle paul saw a heavenly vision of christ as the pillar of fire a light at noon at midday that exceeded the brightness of the sun and that light began to speak to him and he and brother tell us he recognized that that was the logos that was the pillar of fire and he said saul saul why does that persecute astound me and he said who are you lord he said i am jesus whom you persecute so he right away in the heavenly vision he caught the present-day truth of where god was and god gave him instructions in those instructions where you're going to go to the gentiles you're going to bring them from darkness to light you're going to do you're going to do this and that and those instructions were just to paul because some saw the light and saw no man someone heard a thunder and heard no voice but it's evident that those were with him did not catch the same revelation paul caught he had men traveling with them and those men couldn't see what paul saw and those men couldn't hear what paul heard it was to the individual only and paul got an individual vision and an individual voice they heard it as a thunder but to him it was a voice to him the thunder was a commission to him the light the sign was a person and the others that were with him on the journey they didn't catch what paul caught amen and when paul caught it it was a commission to him and he tells agrippa i have not been disobedient to the heavenly vision i just want to say there's been a pillar of light up here in our day some see a cloud but they don't see the person some have heard thunders but they haven't recognized the voice calling their names i heard the thunders it was white horse retinol you've missed the purpose of the voice you've missed the thunders i heard the thunders it said a white horse means antichrist and this spirit means that and that spirit means that you're missing the revelation under the thunders those revelation was christ was going to have a bride what was the revelation christ the mystery of god what was the revelation of the whole book that laid under those seals it was the revelation of the becoming god god becoming tangible god being known as male and female and that revelation that the thunders unlocked and unveiled was calling your name amen not white horse red horse it was calling your position in christ from before the foundation of the world and what your position is now some people heard thunders some heard their name called some saw a cloud some recognize the coming of a person some recognize the shape of the cloud and possibly hoffman's head behind it and maybe some figures in the cloud but they missed the headship coming to the body and the invisible union saw the light but missed the person and where he was going to dwell some heard the thunders but missed the commission but paul recognized the person and paul recognized his commission and of god by revelation there could be a crowd of people all seeing and hearing listening to the tapes and seeing the pictures but this is revealed only to the bride she sees a person she sees her lord coming to dwell in his bride she sees the location of the headship coming to unite with the bride and she hears the voice that calls her name and gives her a commission calling her out of laodicea into the bright age into the manifestation of jesus christ and this revelation is only to the individual you can see the sign but is it your commission you can hear the tapes but is it calling your name you can see with physical eyes and here with physical ears but there has to be another set of eyes and another set of ears deeper than the physical eyes and the physical ears that it becomes more than a picture and more than a tape it becomes my commission and then can you say i have not been disobedient to the heavenly vision but i've recognized my position and my position is to follow that head my position is submit to the headship of the word and they'll allow the word to come into me and be a living oracle of a living god to be a living manifestation of the word for this day it's my commission and i want to be able to stand on that day and said i i saw and recognize and i heard and it commissioned me and i want to say i have not been disobedient to the heavenly vision for with all that is in me i have yielded to the headship of that word i have given myself to that lord christ my husband i've come into an invisible union i've received my commission as the bride at the end time the full measure of the full word coming into full manifestation and bright form and i've accepted it and i've done all i could to surrender to it i want to be the one following him having been called chosen from before the foundation of the world but faithful by my own choosing these things aren't tales stories pictures god is calling somebody god is drawing his people he's revealing himself to him in this hour and he's placing them in a commission to act out the final scene for this dispensation and there's a people are saying yes lord that's the only thing that matters to me in life that's what i want to be let's look at second timothy chapter 4. second timothy chapter 4 and verse 6. paul says for i am now ready to be offered in the time of my departures at hand i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith henceforth laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that date and not to me only but unto all them that love his appearing paul's saying i have fought the good fight i have finished my course god had a course for paul and it's not your course paul has a course for you that's not your neighbor's course they may share and part of it with you but even your spouse if time will continue will not walk all the way of the journey with you statistically there's a course that we have to follow as an individual and that has to be the course that god has ordained and that course is a surrender to his word and a life and submission to his word and i want to finish my course not because i have to but because i want to i want to choose the word not by coercion not by force and not by fear but i want to choose the word because i want to choose the word because it's the greatest desire of my life to be pleasing to my husband the thing that motivates me that i want to motivate me the thing that i want to be primary motivation in my life is a desire to please him above all others above myself and everyone around me and i want to finish my course i want to run my race the portion that god's allotted for me i want to fight well i want to run well i want to run my portion of this course and i want to do it well and i want to do it surrendered to him when it's all done i i want to look into his face and i just want that nod you may not have got everything perfect you you may not have you it's not that that we don't flounder a bit from times it's not that we don't have to check ourselves and restart that's not it but when you cross that line amen you had one thing in your heart and that one thing in your heart was to please me whether you did it beautifully or you did it haphazardly whether you blundered a bit or you pulled it off with a polished style at the end it doesn't matter because what you did is what i wanted you to do you put all my will first in your life and you did it to please me i want to hear well done thou good and faithful servant not because we made it look pretty but because we did it for him not because it it always sounded the nicest and looked the best and not always because it was without offense or without any flaw we can't you know what we're failures to begin with but through it all i want god to pierce down to the depths of me and move away all of the garbage and say down down down down deep where it matters what he wanted was to please me and i want that to be my motivation and i want that to be the thought that cries louder in heaven than my words that i want to please him he's he's called he's chosen before the foundation of the world but those that are following him in this battle are faithful to the word by their own choosing that's what he's been looking for from the time he entrusted his word and his creation to his son adam and his adam's bride and it's failed and failed and failed men have caught portions of it but portions have been obscured but he's coming now to this end time bride and this bride will be a reflection of himself and when christ was here he only did that which pleased the father and this bride is coming to the position where she only does that which pleases her lord and that is my cry and that is my desire i can say like the woman brother ben talked about i'm not what i ought to be i'm not what i want to be but thank god i'm not what i used to be there's something changing and stirring in me all the time as the word is being revealed it's stripping away more of me and it's making me more of an enemy it's taking hybridization and making it my enemy it's taking a wrong mind and making it my enemy and it's taking the focus from john what's happening to john and what will become of this man to where he's saying what's that to thee follow thou me and i'm saying yes lord i'll follow you god help me strip it all away lord so there's no vain glory there's no selfish desire but i want to choose the word on every turn and in every hand and i want to show by my choices my respects and honor to you ready i tell you that's my desire friends and i believe it's your desire and you forgive me if i blunder along the way but that's my motive and i'll forgive you if you blunder along the way we step on each other's toes from time to time and we don't get things exactly right and have to go back and make them right that's fine with me as long as it's fine with you as long as we're all desiring in our hearts to please him to follow him amen and not worry about the brother not worry about the sister but keep our eyes focused on him as long as peter kept his eyes focused on him he could walk on water but when he looked around he began to sing and i don't want to sink at this time there's storms all around i want to be fixed on him and following him and not worried about what's happening with another brother another sister i'll pray for them but i have to stay focused on him or else i'll go down i can't go around and correct the world encourage the world or defend the there's no time for that it's time for me to say god you've got to help me keep my eyes locked on this word amen because if i look away from the word i'm going down and then if i rely on my own senses i'm failing if i don't have time to pray and consecrate myself to god i'm going to blunder the whole day i need god and i need to focus like never before what's that to thee follow thou me what does it matter if all the world forsake you paul as long as you can say i fought a good fight i finished my course i kept the faith but what about this and what about that i fought the good fight i finished my course i kept the faith i said that's my full-time objective to keep myself in that scripture amen let things come and let things go storms will rise and storms will fall things will happen that we don't like political moves will move pressures will come economic things will happen devices and divisions and hurtful things and family issues and and work crisis and it's going to come it's going to ebb and the flow as it ebbs and flows it'll increase and get worse more storms and more hurricanes and more tornadoes more fires and more destruction but there's one thing i have to do is follow him forsaking all others brother venom says in one place he's he's referring to the bride amen sticking with the word and he goes to marriage vows he's speaking of the bride obeying and following the headship of christ and he goes right back to marriage vows and he says keeply keep thee only to him for all of your life whatsoever thou doest keep the only unto him and he says no adultery no flirting with the world nothing else brother ben brings us right back to the marriage vows that's my headship this word that's coming this day i've been united to through an invisible union and i'm to keep only to him and forsake all others and that is a full-time job for me you might have polished it off all right and you might be able to do it half-heartedly but i can't it's requiring all of my devotion all of my consecration all of my life and all of my love just to walk this course he's called for me to walk i think that's what he's looking for his heart's desire was to have a bride of his own choosing and he wanted to manifest that bride so he did a work in our day that no other age has seen and never been recorded like it's been recorded in our day why why did all that happen why did the seals open why did he open the mystery of god because he wanted a people equipped with the word that could surrender to the word so when you receive the word you receive the life of the word and the life of the word begins to live in you and god can demonstrate to this world what a bride is what it means to be submissive to the world what it means to have somebody that he can entrust to follow him we've received what no other age has received so we should walk like no other age has walked god is saying what's that to thee i'll say it this morning because there's a cry in my heart what's that to thee follow thou me but but my my husband but my wife button my children but my job but my what's that to thee follow thou me but all men has forsaken me what's that to thee follow thou on me christ had already told us to forsake everything and follow him so i say tonight or this morning or whatever time it is what's that to thee follow thou me follow him and everything he reveals follow him in every part of your life follow him your public life your private life your work life your church life follow thou me who is he the revealed word in this day the headship that has been restored the mystery of god that has been revealed the entire bible now opened to us that's him the word is him the revelation is him the headship is him and he's saying follow thou me praise god and i'm saying god help me to follow you i'm a fresh surrendering right now to follow you i'm freshly giving up everything to follow you i've done it before but i'll do it again and i'll wake up every morning and do it all over again but i'm surrendering all to follow you because there's no greater calling in life and there's no greater privilege to than to be this end time bride and to be one of the faithful by their own choosing and i'm choosing to follow you let's all stand musicians you come brother blake if you'll come let's just pray lord jesus we thank you god god you've called us to an hour like has never been on the face of the earth before you've called us to a position that no other age is held you've given us a word and greater clarity with greater revelation than any others have had and god you said to whom much is given much is required but god you didn't make a requirement without providing a means so you gave us your word in full measure and you gave us your life in full measure so if we could just receive the word and surrender we could receive that full measure of life to live the word god we're surrendering you're just asking us to choose you and choose the word and you'll provide everything else like you provided or for your bride like you provided for esther help us lord just to take what you've provided and to put it on just to stay under the washing of the water the word for purification to put on the clothes of the word for beautification and perfection and righteousness god may your mind take over our mind may this revelation become our daily meet become our life become our whole objective may we not be disobedient to the heavenly vision for the heavenly vision has given us a commission to be the bride at the end time may those of us who've seen it lord be faithful to obey the heavenly vision to run our course fight the good fight to keep the faith while we yield ourselves to you as a body of believers together we yield to you but we know you're looking for the individual now the one of us or two of us do three or a hundred or however many they'll be that will say lord that is in my heart lord what i heard preached is my cry is my longing is my desire god i pray lord that you would meet that desire in each of your children's heart god whatever they're struggling with i pray that you give them victory over it lord god whatever they want to lay down i pray you give them the willpower to lay it down and that you would give them the strength to walk away that you would provide your spirit to help overcome those things god if we can make our choice lord i pray you would back up our choices by your spirit god as we choose you i pray you come and live inside of us and manifest yourself through us in greater measures than you ever had before that more of us will die and more of you will live that will have a greater surrender and a greater desire to see your will fulfilled and we'll take all our own desires lord and all the desires for the world lord and we're throwing them aside right now we're choosing to throw them aside and asking lord that you would come and take that place take that preeminence that you're looking for the second fold of the threefold plan is preeminence lord total control first place may you have it in me oh god may you have it in each one lord who's yielding themselves to you now may you walk in us may you live in us lord i pray our greatest desire would be to look on the balcony at the end of our journey and see you nod and say well done god that's my greatest desire let it be that way lord if there's anything that's hindering anything that i've allowed or i'm blind to in my own self i pray you reveal it to me now lord that i might purge it away if i've been distracted by what others are doing or or what others are blessed with or not or if i'm distracted by anybody else in their journey and their story forgive me lord help me get my eyes off john let me get my eyes on my brother and sister and help me get my eyes back on you and follow you god do with us as you wish you have a plan and your plan is good if we yield to that lord will arrive at the destination that you have foresaw and we will be satisfied and thankful and happy that we stayed true to you god you got an army in this day that you've called and that you've chosen i believe i'm part of that army being part of that army means that i must be faithful by my own choosing help me god as i yield to you to be faithful by my own choosing i choose your word this revealed word and i reject all else let it be so lord of my life in jesus christ's name amen god bless you all i can't say how much i love being home i loved going on vacation it was wonderful but i can't tell you how much i love being home being amongst people who want to run their race well people who want the word people who've seen the heavenly vision and want to be obedient to the heavenly vision you have no idea what it means to to connect and feel you pull on the word how much this word means to us friends this is time is winding down what that means i don't even know but it's winding down we all sense it we all feel it things are building all around and things are mounting obstacles and pressures but what is that to thee follow thou me our nation's falling apart what is that to thee follow thou me political systems are failing what's that to the economics are shaking what's that to thee follow thou me don't be distracted every system has to collapse it's part of the coming of the kingdom of the lord let it collapse the earth has to rejuvenate itself amen what you're seeing in fires and in earthquakes in a hurricane it's nothing more than the joy of the earth coming into redemption these aren't bad things these are good things the earth is responding to redemption it's wanting to renew itself for the millennium it's longing amen to see the manifestation of the sons of god amen this is all keeping in time amen with god's great redemption plan don't focus on it keep your eyes on him he's got a plan for you he's got a plan for me he sent this word for a reason and he's called you to this word and he's opened your eyes to this word for a purpose and it's not to start a new religion or a new church system or another form of worship like we've had again and again through the ages this is something different now he's come to tear all that away and come back to you and him as individuals together and he wants to be manifest the great god almighty wants to be declared upon this earth inside you he's just looking for somebody that'll choose him that'll yield and surrender i say god let it be me i believe it's me i believe by faith it's me let it be me lord let me give more than i've ever given let me surrender more than i've ever surrendered let it be me oh god i love you all i'm so glad that i can stand here and say i love you i love your fellowship i love your lives i love your testimonies i love you i love being back home i love the light that shines from you i love the word i love god i love the manifestation of god in you god bless you all let's sing like all i want to see is jesus all i want to see is him in me all i want to see is jesus
