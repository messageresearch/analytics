[0:00] let's just stick with the bible amen
[0:02] let's just stick with the scriptures and
[0:03] get this out of my mind
[0:04] that this is a bad group and this is a
[0:06] good group amen the ones he's calling
[0:08] accursed were priests and preachers and
[0:10] ministers
[0:12] amen people who lived clean lives upon
[0:14] the earth amen they were whole
[0:16] considered holy men by everybody around
[0:18] them they had families and had children
[0:19] and held down jobs and paid their taxes
[0:21] and obeyed the speed laws and went to
[0:24] church every sunday
[0:25] amen but because they persecuted the
[0:28] true church because they fought against
[0:29] the truth
[0:30] amen because they called blasphemous
[0:32] names to the things that were actually
[0:34] righteous and holy and clean
[0:35] amen he wasn't judging them because they
[0:38] they didn't they lived a nasty life on
[0:39] earth they lived a fine life on earth
[0:45] they they they they did good works on
[0:48] the earth they
[0:48] they may have fed the poor amen they may
[0:50] have have clothed naked children in
[0:52] africa they may have done all kinds of
[0:54] things
[0:54] but god is not calling them cursed amen
[0:57] because they didn't do good works he's
[0:59] calling them
[1:00] cursed because they did not receive the
[1:03] word
[1:03] in their day they didn't even
[1:06] treat it right they didn't even give it
[1:08] a a clothing they didn't even give when
[1:11] the word was expressed when elohim was
[1:13] materializing
[1:14] they didn't even have the common decency
[1:16] amen to give him a little bit of food or
[1:18] even be kind to him
[1:22] the other group that he says enter you
[1:24] into the joys of the lord amen the other
[1:26] group that he says enter in
[1:28] he wasn't calling them amen if you by
[1:30] human
[1:31] eyes would just look at this you'll see
[1:33] in that group that goes that way
[1:35] will be the biker with the tattoos and
[1:37] the sleeves and the neck piercings but
[1:39] there was something
[1:40] in him that could love an expressed
[1:41] attribute of god there was something in
[1:43] him that just wanted to do something for
[1:45] you
[1:46] it could be your neighbor it could be a
[1:47] co-worker it could be who knows what it
[1:49] will be
[1:50] but there's something in them it's not a
[1:52] c gene of god because they can't be a
[1:53] seed gene of god and not come all the
[1:55] way into the word
[1:56] amen but but there's something in them
[1:58] that loves
[1:59] elohim materializing
[2:04] they may not be able to break out of a
[2:06] life of sin they may not be able to stop
[2:08] amen the influences in their life or
[2:10] overcome past trials as a child
[2:12] and afflictions and all the things that
[2:14] they may not be able to get free from
[2:16] that
[2:16] amen but there's one thing that they can
[2:18] do and there's one thing
[2:19] amen that the the lord jesus christ
[2:22] expresses in this separation is that
[2:25] when i was hungry
[2:26] you fed me but what about these tattoos
[2:30] i can take care of that
[2:35] what about my adultery and what about
[2:37] what about this and what about that
[2:39] amen that's not in question at this
[2:41] judgment at this
[2:42] judgment what is in question is what did
[2:45] you do with the word when you came in
[2:47] contact with it
[2:48] could you even be nice to it amen could
[2:50] you even express human love
