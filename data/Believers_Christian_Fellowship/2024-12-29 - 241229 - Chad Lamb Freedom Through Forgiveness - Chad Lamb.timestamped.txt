[11:12] anybody else is visiting you're very
[11:13] welcome and we want to say God bless you
[11:16] and while we're standing let's take our
[11:17] Bibles together let's turn to
[11:24] Colossians Colossians
[11:29] chapter
[11:37] 2 Colossians chapter
[11:40] 2 and we'll read just one verse together
[11:44] verse 13 Colossians
[11:47] 2:13 and you being dead in your sins and
[11:50] uncircumcision of your flesh hath he
[11:52] quickened together with them having
[11:54] forgiven you all trespasses amen God
[11:57] bless you as you're seated
[12:02] so when we were dead in our sins and
[12:06] uncircumcised in our flesh he quickened
[12:08] us together and has forgiven us all
[12:11] trespasses I don't know about you but
[12:12] I'm pretty happy for all the word all
[12:14] there all
[12:16] trespasses amen if you could turn with
[12:18] me to Luke let's turn to Luke chapter
[12:27] 23 Luke chapter
[12:32] 23 and verse we'll begin at verse 33
[12:35] Luke 23 and 33 and this is the scene of
[12:39] the crucifixion of our
[12:42] Lord and it says in verse 33 and when
[12:45] they were come to the place which is
[12:46] called Calvary There They Crucified him
[12:50] and the malifa is one on the right hand
[12:52] and the other on the left then said
[12:53] Jesus father forgive them for they know
[12:56] not what they do and they parted his
[12:58] reignment and cast lots the people stood
[13:01] beholding him and the rulers also with
[13:02] them derided him saying he saved others
[13:05] let him save himself if he be Christ The
[13:07] Chosen of God and the soldiers also
[13:10] mocked him coming to him and offering
[13:12] him vinegar and saying if thou be the
[13:15] king of the Jews save thyself and the
[13:17] superscription also was written over him
[13:19] in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew
[13:21] this is the king of the Jews amen so
[13:25] here we see at the
[13:28] crucifixion we find uh we find Jesus in
[13:33] a terrible situation but for us it ends
[13:35] up being a wonderful situation because
[13:38] his crucifixion is our freedom amen his
[13:41] death brought us life and here we find
[13:46] uh Jesus he comes verse 33 tells us that
[13:49] there they crucified him and we read on
[13:52] to where they're mocking him and
[13:54] deriding him and and and here he is the
[13:57] word made flesh and they they have now
[14:00] taken his word and they've condemned him
[14:02] by his own word that he gave to them and
[14:05] they they've rejected him he's come in
[14:07] the fullness of the word as he promised
[14:08] and now they're rejecting him deriding
[14:11] him and mocking him and here in this
[14:14] scene if we could just get the scene
[14:16] it's brother B said it's the most
[14:17] pitiful scene here ever because here is
[14:20] the Lord Of Glory the creator of all
[14:21] things amen the word himself and here
[14:24] they are crucifying their lord the one
[14:27] who came to save them the one who came
[14:29] to deliver them the one who came to
[14:30] fulfill his promises everything they
[14:32] hoped for everything they dreamed of
[14:34] everything they needed was right there
[14:36] and they were crucifying
[14:38] it and and with mocking and scorings and
[14:41] beatings and rejection and and false
[14:44] accusations and everything that you
[14:46] could pile on was piled on and here he
[14:48] is lifted up on on on the shame of a
[14:52] cross stripped naked hung as a malifa as
[14:55] a criminal in a public place for all to
[14:58] walk by and here he is in this scene in
[15:00] the worst of worst situations for a
[15:02] human being to get in and what does he
[15:04] say
[15:06] father forgive
[15:10] them for they know not what they
[15:14] do when we see the scene if we if we
[15:17] could ever actually Glimpse the
[15:20] scene I think it would change
[15:23] us we could ever realize what he
[15:26] said and not separate it from the
[15:29] context of when he said
[15:31] it because we can say he said father
[15:34] forgive them that that that's a
[15:36] wonderful statement father forg they
[15:38] don't know what they do but when you
[15:39] place it in the context of what he was
[15:42] going through and what was happening and
[15:44] and the pain and the suffering and the
[15:46] rejection and the blood and the tears
[15:48] and and the mockings and the score and
[15:50] and you just put it in context it's a
[15:52] remarkable statement that a man could
[15:54] say such a thing in such a condition and
[15:56] such an atmosphere
[15:59] amen and so tonight this morning not
[16:03] tonight this morning I just want to talk
[16:05] on freedom through
[16:08] forgiveness and mean there's some things
[16:10] that are so absolutely fundamental to
[16:12] our Christian walk and one of them is
[16:14] forgiveness and it becomes so
[16:16] fundamental we sometimes don't realize
[16:19] the impact that it has in our lives and
[16:22] we don't realize how fundamental it is
[16:25] because brother B said you can never
[16:26] live leave the ABCs and do Algebra so we
[16:29] can never leave the fundamentals amen no
[16:31] matter how deep we go what really
[16:34] happens is the deeper we go the deeper
[16:36] the fundamentals go they don't stay
[16:39] shallow they get deeper and Calvary gets
[16:41] deeper with the Revelation with the
[16:43] opening of the seals Calvary got deeper
[16:45] now we know why a man had to come and
[16:47] shed his blood because we know what
[16:48] happened in the Garden of Eden right
[16:50] that's right the corruption of the blood
[16:51] of man now it had to be a perfect one
[16:54] sinless virgin born who came as a
[16:56] substitutionary offering to shed his
[16:58] blood to buy back all that Adam lost
[17:00] amen none of the fundamentals get any
[17:02] shallower with the opening of the word
[17:04] they all get deeper
[17:06] amen so here we look at Freedom through
[17:09] forgiveness and here we know that we
[17:12] have freedom because of
[17:14] forgiveness because Jesus forgave us
[17:18] let's go to Matthew chapter
[17:20] 6 and this service will be maybe a
[17:23] little different than usual there's this
[17:27] subject that
[17:30] uh these things that I'm going to share
[17:31] with you are things that I've shared
[17:33] with numerous people just in my office
[17:36] during counseling just as we sit
[17:38] together usually when I share these
[17:40] things it's usually sitting uh across
[17:43] the coffee table or a dinner table with
[17:45] a piece of paper and I'm drawing and I'm
[17:47] talking amen I never really thought of
[17:50] preaching on this subject before because
[17:52] it's something I deal with in counseling
[17:53] but I I I went through it with somebody
[17:56] recently and afterwards I just realized
[17:58] you know what this is something that
[18:00] this is fundamental to our life and
[18:02] something we need to understand and so
[18:04] I'd like to share it with you so
[18:06] everybody just pretend we're sitting at
[18:07] a coffee table you're in one chair
[18:10] you're on the couch I'm in a chair and
[18:11] we're just going to draw amen and and
[18:13] I'm going to use the Whiteboard today so
[18:15] you'll see some of my beautiful drawings
[18:17] stick figures and lines and arrows and
[18:21] amen praise God so if you'll just bear
[18:24] with me and let me share amen what's on
[18:26] my heart maybe in a in a in a way that's
[18:28] a little bit different
[18:29] in Matthew 6:9 let's turn there
[18:36] together uh Jesus is going to show the
[18:40] disciples how to
[18:42] pray and he says after this manner
[18:44] therefore pray you Our Father which art
[18:46] in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy
[18:48] kingdom come thy will be done in earth
[18:51] as it is in heaven give us this day our
[18:53] daily bread and forgive us our debts as
[18:56] we forgive our debtors
[18:59] that's
[19:00] interesting he said forgive us our debts
[19:03] as we forgive our
[19:04] debtors the word as we is really
[19:07] interesting you can read this several
[19:10] different ways this is the way the
[19:11] scriptures always work you say father
[19:14] forgive us and then we'll forgive our
[19:16] debtors but that's not exactly how it's
[19:18] written it's father forgive us as we
[19:20] forgive our
[19:22] debtors so the question is what if we're
[19:24] not forgiving our debtors
[19:28] yeah and this word
[19:30] debtors uh it it's translated debtor or
[19:33] sinner or which is owed several times in
[19:36] the New Testament and one of the
[19:37] definition is one who has not yet made
[19:40] amends to whom he has
[19:42] injured one who has not yet made amends
[19:45] to whom he is injured that means we're
[19:48] supposed we're asking God forgive my
[19:50] debts as I forgive my debtors amen so
[19:54] I'm going to forgive those who have not
[19:57] yet made amends for the
[19:59] injury amen so I'm not going to forgive
[20:02] them after they've cleaned everything up
[20:04] and and made it all better and and gave
[20:06] retribute but I'm going to forgive them
[20:08] while they're still a
[20:12] debor amen this is simple I mean how
[20:15] many times have we went over the Lord's
[20:17] Prayer it's so simple it's so
[20:18] fundamental but it actually becomes
[20:20] really really deep when it comes to a
[20:22] life
[20:23] application and we're going to find out
[20:25] how serious forgiveness is
[20:28] and and so he says uh I'll read verse 12
[20:31] again and forgive us our debts as we
[20:33] forgive our debtors and lead us not into
[20:35] temptation but Deliver Us from the E
[20:37] From Evil for thine is the kingdom and
[20:39] the power and the glory forever amen
[20:43] amen then then he says for if you
[20:46] forgive men their trespasses your
[20:48] heavenly father will also forgive you
[20:52] but if you forgive not men their
[20:54] trespasses neither will your father
[20:56] forgive your trespasses
[21:00] es I don't know about you but those last
[21:02] two verses took the seriousness of
[21:04] forgiveness up to the maximum level
[21:07] right cuz what happens if the father
[21:09] doesn't forgive me my
[21:12] trespasses how serious is that so now
[21:15] we're dealing with the most serious of
[21:18] subjects amen which is me forgiving
[21:22] others I want to read this again verse
[21:24] 14 for if you forgive men their
[21:27] trespasses your heav L father will also
[21:29] forgive you but if you forgive not men
[21:32] their trespasses neither will your
[21:35] father forgive you your
[21:38] trespasses I don't think we can skip
[21:41] over this
[21:43] principle how many of you need your
[21:45] trespasses forgiven how many of you need
[21:47] them forgiven every day on a daily basis
[21:50] and you don't ever want to be in a
[21:51] position where your father will not
[21:52] forgive your trespasses so what must I
[21:54] do I must forgive men their trespasses
[21:59] amen this word
[22:00] trespasses uh one of the definitions in
[22:02] the concordance is aapse or deviation
[22:05] from truth and uprightness a sin a
[22:07] misdeed so something somebody's done to
[22:10] you amen that made them a debtor to you
[22:13] because they maybe owe you an apology
[22:15] maybe they they did something wrong to
[22:18] you they defamed your character they did
[22:20] something they stole from you whatever
[22:22] they did amen it was a trespass against
[22:25] you amen and and now we're told to
[22:27] forgive them them when when they're
[22:32] debtors we always think about forgiving
[22:35] people once they make it right when they
[22:36] come and when they come and say they're
[22:38] sorry I'll forgive
[22:39] them but that's not what this scripture
[22:42] say telling us we're not to forgive them
[22:45] when they say they're sorry when they
[22:46] pay their debts we're forgive them as
[22:49] debtors because I want my father to
[22:51] forgive me my
[22:53] trespasses amen amen uh let's go back to
[22:57] Matthew chapter
[22:59] 5 and read uh just a couple verses there
[23:03] Matthew
[23:08] 5:43 Matthew 5:43 ye have heard that it
[23:12] hath been said Thou shalt love thy
[23:14] neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say
[23:16] unto you love your enemies bless them
[23:18] that curse you do good to them that hate
[23:20] you and pray for them that despitefully
[23:22] use you and persecute you that you may
[23:26] be the children of your father which is
[23:28] in heaven heaven for he maketh his son
[23:30] to rise on the evil and on the good and
[23:32] sendeth reain on the just and on the
[23:34] unjust so now he's telling us that no
[23:37] longer eye for an eye the way you treat
[23:39] me is the way I'll treat you back that's
[23:41] all gone am because he says I say to you
[23:46] love your
[23:47] enemies
[23:49] amen bless them that curse you do good
[23:51] to them that hate you and pray for them
[23:53] which despitefully use you and persecute
[23:55] you that you may be children of your
[23:57] father amen what's he saying he says
[24:00] you're supposed to be acting like your
[24:03] father this is how you demonstrate whose
[24:05] child you are amen and when we talk
[24:07] about coming to adoption coming to
[24:09] adoption is actually coming to a place
[24:12] where you're like the father amen you
[24:14] handle Affairs you handle situations
[24:16] like the father that's when you come to
[24:18] adoption that was the report that the
[24:19] Holy Spirit gave back the tutor gave
[24:22] back to the father said you should have
[24:23] seen the way he handled those sheep he
[24:25] did it just like you you should have
[24:26] seen you would have been so proud of him
[24:28] did it just the way you do it and then
[24:30] the father knows now I'm ready to give
[24:32] him some responsibility why because he
[24:34] can handle the situation the way I
[24:36] handle the situation in maturity and now
[24:39] Jesus is telling us no longer eye for an
[24:41] eye tooth for tooth now you love those
[24:44] who hate you you do good to them who
[24:46] despitefully use you amen you pray for
[24:48] them amen no matter what they do you
[24:51] pray for them you love them you do good
[24:53] unto them so that you can move into the
[24:55] image of your father so you can be like
[24:58] God because that's that's how God acts
[25:01] that's how he acted when he came for
[25:02] Redemption that's what Christ was on the
[25:04] cross amen he he was Emmanuel God With
[25:07] Us standing there demonstrating what he
[25:09] he didn't just give us Commandments he
[25:11] showed us what it's like in the face of
[25:13] some of the worst rejection persecution
[25:16] false accusation mistreatment that a
[25:18] human being has ever gone through and
[25:20] he's who's mistreating him his Brethren
[25:23] his people the ones that he redeemed the
[25:25] ones he gave the word to the one he's
[25:27] protected the one he's blessed the ones
[25:29] he's prospered they're the ones who are
[25:31] mocking him and he's up here amen where
[25:33] did he receive the wounds in the house
[25:35] of his
[25:37] friends and he's standing there in the
[25:39] worst of worst
[25:41] situations father forgive
[25:48] them
[25:51] amen we
[25:54] know that our goal in this life
[25:58] is to be in the very likeness of Jesus
[26:02] Christ to be to to to to come to a place
[26:05] where Christ is Manifest in his fullness
[26:08] in Bride form that's what the message
[26:11] came to awaken us to that's what the
[26:13] word came to BR bring the power of
[26:15] transformation to transform Us in to
[26:17] this image of Christ where Christ is now
[26:19] alive and a many membered bride and she
[26:22] will reflect him his character his
[26:25] nature the way that he operates
[26:29] and so we we had it demonstrated and now
[26:32] it's more than a it needs to be more
[26:34] than a demonstration it needs to become
[26:35] a
[26:36] manifestation in us let's go to Matthew
[26:47] 18 we're going to lay down a lot of
[26:50] pieces and then we'll pray that the Lord
[26:51] help us to put these pieces
[26:56] together Matthew 18
[26:58] and verse
[27:02] 21 then came Peter to him and said Lord
[27:05] how often shall my brother sin against
[27:07] me and I forgive him till seven times
[27:10] Jesus say unto him I say not unto thee
[27:12] until seven times but until 70 *
[27:15] 7 therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven
[27:17] likened to a certain King which would
[27:19] take account of his servants and when he
[27:21] had begun to reckon one was brought unto
[27:23] him which owed him 10,000
[27:26] talents but for as much as he had not to
[27:28] pay his Lord commanded him to be sold
[27:30] and his wife and children and all that
[27:32] he had and payment to be made the
[27:35] servant therefore fell down and
[27:37] worshiped him saying Lord have patience
[27:39] with me and I will pay thee all then the
[27:41] Lord of thy servant was moved with
[27:43] compassion and loosed him and forgave
[27:45] him the
[27:47] debt now I want you to look at verse 27
[27:51] very
[27:52] carefully the man said for have patience
[27:56] with me and I'll repay you
[27:59] all so I'll pay it back I'm a debtor but
[28:02] I'll pay my debt but this King when he
[28:06] had compassion on him he said then the
[28:09] lord of the servant was moved with
[28:10] compassion and loosed him and forgave
[28:13] him the
[28:15] death this is
[28:17] forgiveness this is real
[28:20] forgiveness real forgiveness is not you
[28:24] know forgiveness would not have been I
[28:26] will now delay my judgment I won't sell
[28:28] your wife and I won't sell your children
[28:30] I'll give you more time to pay me back
[28:32] I'll be patient that's patience that's
[28:35] not
[28:36] forgiveness forgiveness is totally
[28:38] different than patience patience was
[28:41] okay I'll give you another year we'll
[28:43] see if you can pay me back but if not
[28:45] all I've done is delay my judgment it's
[28:48] still coming but forgiveness is you
[28:50] don't owe me anything anymore you're
[28:53] loose your account is clear I've taken
[28:55] it back to zero you owe me nothing
[28:58] you're now completely free that's
[29:02] forgiveness
[29:05] amen that's real
[29:08] forgiveness and so let's keep reading in
[29:10] verse 28 but the same servant went out
[29:13] and found one of his fellow servants
[29:16] which owed him 100
[29:17] P 10 what was it a thousand let me go
[29:21] back and read what it
[29:23] was 10,000 talents
[29:28] compared to a few
[29:31] Pence he says 100 Pence and he laid
[29:35] hands on him and took him by the throat
[29:37] saying pay me that thou owest and his
[29:39] fellow servant fell down at his feet and
[29:41] besought him saying have patience with
[29:43] me and I will pay the all and he would
[29:45] not but went and cast him into prison
[29:47] till he should pay the debt so when his
[29:50] fellow servants saw what was done they
[29:52] were very sorry and came and told unto
[29:54] their lord all that was done then his
[29:57] Lord after that that he had called him
[29:58] said unto him oh thou Wicked servant I
[30:01] forgave thee all that debt because thou
[30:03] desired me should us not thou have also
[30:07] have had compassion on thy fellow
[30:08] servant even as I had pity on thee and
[30:11] this Lord was wroth and delivered him to
[30:13] the tormentors till he should pay all
[30:15] that was due unto him so likewise shall
[30:18] my heavenly father do also unto you if
[30:20] you from your hearts forgive not
[30:23] everyone's brother their trespasses
[30:28] about you but that series of scriptures
[30:29] I just read are so wow they're
[30:35] inescapable let's just put it that way
[30:37] there's no way to dodge it they're in
[30:38] they're completely inescapable amen we
[30:41] can't get around it and we can't get
[30:43] around the consequences for
[30:46] unforgiveness so here we we we see the
[30:49] story that that the man was forgiven so
[30:51] much and as as much as he was forgiven
[30:54] he didn't have the same heart to forgive
[30:56] his his brother his fellow servant but
[30:58] he treated him as if you've offended me
[31:01] you owe me and he forgot how much he had
[31:03] offended and how much he owed and he
[31:05] forgot that he was forgiven he should
[31:07] have turned around the master said you
[31:09] should have done as I did to you and
[31:10] have compassion on your fellow servant
[31:12] but because not now you you have no
[31:15] forgiveness you have
[31:17] nothing so this is
[31:20] serious this is very serious so the to
[31:23] me the subject is very very serious and
[31:26] and this last I want to look at this
[31:28] last sentence again I'm going to read
[31:31] the whole verse verse 35 so likewise
[31:33] shall my heavenly father do also unto
[31:35] you if you from your
[31:38] hearts forgive not everyone his brother
[31:42] their
[31:43] trespasses now all of a sudden it for me
[31:46] it just got
[31:47] deeper because this cannot be an
[31:49] intellectual
[31:51] exercise this cannot be a form or a
[31:54] ritual this cannot be something I do
[31:56] because he said I have to do it because
[31:58] I have to forgive from my heart Hey
[32:00] listen forgiving from your heart is much
[32:02] harder than it sounds it's not just
[32:04] words it's not rhetoric it's not
[32:06] something that you can just say and do
[32:08] as a ritual as a form I forgive you but
[32:10] if your heart is not attached to your
[32:12] word that's not the right kind of
[32:14] forgiveness because he says if you from
[32:17] your hearts forgive not so it doesn't
[32:20] matter what you
[32:22] say if you from your hearts forgive not
[32:25] everyone is brother their trespasses so
[32:27] what would happen if you don't do that
[32:29] your heavenly father will do also unto
[32:31] you as this servant did so as the master
[32:35] did to the servant so we find how
[32:37] serious this is I can't just say you've
[32:40] offended me but I forgive you but I walk
[32:42] away and my heart is still bitter toward
[32:44] you I still hold you in contempt I'm
[32:46] still angry with you if I'm that way
[32:49] then I haven't yet met the requirements
[32:51] that the father is looking for for
[32:53] forgiveness because he's not looking for
[32:55] words he's not looking for a church form
[32:58] he's not looking for rhetoric he's
[33:00] looking for somebody that will forgive
[33:02] from their
[33:04] heart
[33:06] am and I tell you that if I don't know
[33:10] how to put it in perspective but I've
[33:12] sat with many people and talked to many
[33:14] people who' have been deeply wounded by
[33:15] things that have gone wrong in their
[33:17] life and you don't realize how hard this
[33:19] sentence is it's not something you can
[33:21] manufacture it's not something you can
[33:23] make up it is not something you can
[33:25] pretend it is going to take the actual
[33:27] grace of God in your life it's going to
[33:28] take the spirit of God to help you with
[33:30] this process you're not going to do it
[33:32] by willpower you're not going to do it
[33:34] by your nice personality it's going to
[33:36] take somebody that can come in and do
[33:38] some heart surgery amen and bring from
[33:40] your heart a true forgiveness for
[33:42] somebody else amen most of what we call
[33:44] forgiveness is just lip service it's
[33:46] just a ritual because the Bible says I
[33:48] have to but we need some real
[33:50] forgiveness amen the way Christ forgave
[33:52] is the way we have to forgive so that we
[33:54] can be children of our father
[33:58] it's going to take the working of the
[33:59] holy spirit it's going to take a genuine
[34:01] Christ nature it's going to take
[34:04] reality and if we're not getting down to
[34:06] the reality we haven't
[34:10] forgiven that's why I say this message
[34:13] takes everything
[34:15] deeper
[34:17] everything you're not going to be able
[34:18] to stand if if you stand before God and
[34:21] you say why did you have unforgiveness
[34:23] in your heart towards your brother said
[34:25] no I told him I forgave him
[34:28] you're asking did I tell you I forgave
[34:29] you yeah he told me he forgave me that's
[34:31] not what I'm looking at why do you have
[34:33] unforgiveness in your
[34:37] heart that's where the condemnation is
[34:40] not in what came out of your mouth but
[34:41] what's in your
[34:43] heart so it's much deeper I say it's
[34:46] much deeper and it's also
[34:51] impossible but I know a God who can do
[34:53] the
[34:56] impossible this mess message brother bam
[34:58] says in the message the church and its
[34:59] condition he says how many hear this
[35:02] black siding oh you say I wouldn't admit
[35:04] that brother benen but look if that Dove
[35:06] of meekness is gone from you brother
[35:08] there's something wrong there's
[35:10] something wrong when you can't bear with
[35:12] one another when you can't forgive every
[35:14] person from the depths of your heart no
[35:17] matter what they've done or what they've
[35:19] said if you can't forgive them from the
[35:21] depth Jesus said if you don't forgive
[35:23] every man his trespasses from your heart
[35:25] neither does your heavenly father
[35:27] forgive you
[35:28] you so if there's if we're not able to
[35:31] forgive from our heart there's something
[35:33] wrong amen and I'll say it that this
[35:36] there's not something uniquely wrong
[35:38] with you if you have trouble forgiving
[35:39] from your heart it just makes you a
[35:42] human being like every other human being
[35:44] that's fallen and frail and subject to
[35:46] many things amen but but the dove of the
[35:50] Holy Ghost is there to work in our heart
[35:52] Amen to bring out the nature of Christ
[35:54] so that we can forgive from the heart
[35:59] Amen brother bam says in and Christ is
[36:01] the mystery of God revealed said if the
[36:03] brother you think he's a little wrong or
[36:05] sister say Lord don't let me never have
[36:07] the root of bitterness spring up because
[36:09] it'll affect him and it'll take the
[36:11] Christ right out of my life I want you
[36:14] to look at how serious this
[36:16] is so he's he's talking about you think
[36:18] a brother's a little wrong so there's
[36:20] some sort of disagreement or offense or
[36:22] something something there you think the
[36:24] brother's a little wrong or the sister
[36:26] you say Lord don't let me never have the
[36:28] root of bitterness spring
[36:30] up so when there's
[36:34] offenses and
[36:36] Wrongs it can create bitterness in our
[36:39] heart because what happens is when
[36:41] somebody has uh trespassed against us
[36:45] what really has happened is they've
[36:47] wounded our
[36:48] heart and I'm talking about your heart
[36:50] I'm talking about the second realm of
[36:52] you your spirit realm your spirit man
[36:55] when somebody has trespassed against you
[36:56] and done you wrong they have wounded
[36:58] your heart and that wound in the heart
[37:01] if it if it doesn't heal amen it it it
[37:04] starts to grow
[37:07] bitterness and bitterness is poison that
[37:11] will affect every part of our
[37:13] Lives
[37:15] yeah he says now don't never let have a
[37:18] root of bitterness spring up because
[37:20] it'll affect him it'll take the Christ
[37:23] right out of my life that poison acids
[37:26] of malice and jealousy and hatred that
[37:28] will just take the Holy Spirit right
[37:30] away from you it'll run him from the
[37:32] Tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of
[37:33] God or drive it away from here hurt your
[37:35] pastor it'll do everything don't you do
[37:38] that so we cannot listen if we want to
[37:42] cause destruction all around us when we
[37:44] get offended amen if we want to cause
[37:47] destruction everywhere around us when
[37:48] we're offended what we need to do is
[37:50] hold on to that offense nurse it a
[37:52] little bit feel sorry for ourselves and
[37:55] focus on it and what it'll do is create
[37:57] bitterness and it'll destroy everyone
[37:59] that's in contact with us yeah right
[38:02] amen and we'll show that in a little bit
[38:05] so we've got to have a way we have to
[38:07] understand what forgiveness is I mean we
[38:09] can talk all day long about forgive
[38:11] forgive forgive forgive from the heart
[38:13] forgive but I found it so helpful to
[38:15] actually dig down look at the example we
[38:17] have and find out what forgiveness is
[38:19] what does forgiveness look like amen
[38:21] what impact does it have and how can I
[38:23] tell if I
[38:24] forgiven so those are the things that I
[38:26] would like to talk about today but first
[38:29] I'd like to look at two
[38:31] scriptures uh let's go to Matthew 18 or
[38:35] we're here at Matthew 18 praise God
[38:37] Matthew
[38:44] 18:7 Matthew 18:7 woe unto the world
[38:48] because of offenses for it must needs be
[38:51] that offenses come but woe to that man
[38:53] by whom the offense
[38:56] cometh I love the second phrase in this
[38:59] sentence when he says for it must needs
[39:02] be that offenses
[39:04] come Jesus is telling us this is
[39:09] unavoidable unavoidable you're not going
[39:12] to pass through life without somebody
[39:14] trespassing against you you're not going
[39:17] to make it very far in life without
[39:19] offenses coming and offenses must needs
[39:22] be amen these things have to be why be
[39:26] because I could give you mult multiple
[39:27] reasons I don't always know on every
[39:29] offense what's happening but I know one
[39:31] thing God is trying to display the
[39:33] nature of Christ and God is trying to
[39:34] grow us into the image of Christ amen
[39:37] God is using these things Amen to
[39:39] manifest his word because many of these
[39:41] things cannot be manifest only in the
[39:43] backdrop of white but white shows up in
[39:45] the backdrop of black so there must be
[39:47] an offense so the word can be made
[39:50] manifest amen we have to be Christlike
[39:53] how are we going to be Christlike if we
[39:55] don't have the opportunity to forgive
[39:57] the way Christ forgave God has to create
[39:59] in our lives opportunities so that we
[40:02] can manifest The Life of
[40:04] Christ offenses and offenses also move
[40:07] forward the program of God because
[40:09] there's prophecies that have to take
[40:10] effect and for those prophecies to take
[40:12] effect there have to be offenses
[40:14] somebody had to crucify the Lord amen
[40:16] for that prophecy to go into effect
[40:18] offenses must needs
[40:20] be somebody has to persecute the church
[40:23] to fulfill the word amen somebody has to
[40:26] create offenses it has to be there
[40:28] that's why amen we got to stop being so
[40:31] surprised amen when something happens in
[40:33] our
[40:34] lives and me act like why is this
[40:36] happened to me why is this happened to
[40:38] me stop asking why is this happened to
[40:40] me because brother bandham taught us
[40:43] that nothing happens by accident in the
[40:45] life of a Believer but the clock is
[40:47] ticking right on time and there's things
[40:49] that happen to us that are wrong that
[40:51] are hurtful that destroy us on the
[40:54] inside and you say how can that be God
[40:56] offenses must needs
[40:59] be it has to be there amen and what God
[41:02] is doing he's he's training you he's
[41:04] teaching us he's healing us he's
[41:06] building us he's doing a myriad of
[41:09] things I don't even I can't even fathom
[41:11] all the things that God is doing in
[41:12] every circumstance because it's
[41:14] multifaceted and more complex than I'll
[41:16] ever comprehend but one thing I know is
[41:19] offenses must needs be so why am I
[41:21] shocked when I'm
[41:23] offended if we could get over the shock
[41:26] if we could get over the disappointment
[41:27] and discouragement we would handle it 10
[41:29] times better from the very outgate
[41:31] instead of saying how in the world could
[41:33] that brother do that to me it's all
[41:35] wrong offenses must needs
[41:40] be so when offenses come let's switch
[41:43] our thinking from what was me feeling
[41:45] sorry for myself to this offense is here
[41:48] what does God want me to do what does
[41:50] the scripture say what can I do to grow
[41:53] what can I do to shine light what can I
[41:55] do to be Christ in this situation
[42:01] amen let's go to Luke
[42:06] 17 remember I said years ago I made the
[42:09] statement you can only ever be
[42:12] disappointment disappointed if something
[42:15] doesn't meet your
[42:16] expectations it's the only way to be
[42:18] disappointed so if you wake up in the
[42:21] morning and say I'm going to have a
[42:22] horrible day today and you have a
[42:23] horrible day you're not
[42:25] disappointed there's no disint
[42:27] appointment if you wake up in the
[42:28] morning say this is going to be the best
[42:29] day of my life and disappointing things
[42:31] happen difficult things you're going to
[42:32] end the day very disappointed cu the
[42:35] only way to be disappointed is when
[42:37] something doesn't meet your
[42:40] expectations so many times we're
[42:42] disappointed in life because we have the
[42:44] wrong expectation of this life we expect
[42:48] God to keep us as babies we expect to
[42:50] ride on training wheels all of our we
[42:52] expect God to shelter us and put his
[42:54] arms around and let put us in a bubble
[42:55] and never let anything bad to happen we
[42:57] have the wrong expectation and because
[42:59] we have the wrong expectation many times
[43:01] we get severely
[43:04] disappointed but maybe we should come
[43:06] back to the scriptures and the message
[43:07] and come with the right expectation I'm
[43:09] here for training God's going to beat
[43:11] all of me out of me he's going to use
[43:13] circumstances and situations and good
[43:15] things and bad things everything in
[43:17] between and what's he doing he's trying
[43:19] to mold me into the character of the
[43:21] seed that he's planted inside of me he's
[43:22] trying to bring that Seed Life out on
[43:25] display which is his life
[43:28] and to do that he's got to crush parts
[43:30] of me and he's got to cut parts of me
[43:32] and he's got to change me amen and these
[43:34] circumstances that change me no longer
[43:36] are outside the plan and program of God
[43:38] the right smack dab in the middle of the
[43:41] plan and program of God for my life so
[43:43] I'm not disappointed when disappointing
[43:46] things
[43:47] happen now listen we're all human beings
[43:49] we all have to go through the phase of
[43:51] disappointment but just let the
[43:53] circumstances soak down a little deeper
[43:55] in meditation until the truth meets that
[43:57] disappointment and pushes it back out
[43:59] and say no no no God is still on the
[44:01] throne he knows who I am I'm his child
[44:04] and he doesn't permit anything unless
[44:06] it's for
[44:08] good so this is a good
[44:12] thing somebody told a lie about you it's
[44:14] ruining your reputation it's a good
[44:18] thing why because God wouldn't have let
[44:20] it happen unless it work together for
[44:23] good Luke
[44:25] 17 verse one
[44:33] Luke 17 And1 then said he unto his
[44:35] disciples it is impossible but that
[44:37] offenses will come but War unto him
[44:40] through whom they come it were better
[44:42] for him that a millstone were hanged
[44:44] about his neck and he was cast into the
[44:46] sea then that he should offend one of
[44:47] these little ones take heed to
[44:49] yourselves If thy brother trespass
[44:51] against thee rebuke him and if he repent
[44:54] forgive him and if he trespass against
[44:56] thee
[44:57] thee seven times in a day and seven
[44:59] times in a day turn again to thee and
[45:01] repent Thou shalt forgive him what's he
[45:04] saying he's saying hey these things have
[45:06] to
[45:07] happen they have to happen if your
[45:10] brother if your brother can offend thee
[45:13] seven times in a day listen if I had a
[45:15] brother that was offending me seven
[45:17] times in a day I mean really think about
[45:19] it seven time now I mean some of you had
[45:22] little brothers that offended you more
[45:23] than that in the day I'm talking to a
[45:26] brother sister in the church offending
[45:27] you seven times a day I mean you talk
[45:30] about that's going to be hard to deal
[45:33] with like first time okay I'll give it
[45:35] to you second time now third time listen
[45:37] this is getting ridiculous fourth time
[45:40] I've had I'm up to here with
[45:43] you but God is showing us a principle
[45:46] amen that God never stopped forgiving us
[45:49] we should never stop forgiving someone
[45:51] else God has never refused us
[45:53] forgiveness why would we refuse
[45:54] forgiveness to anybody else if we refuse
[45:56] forgiveness anybody else then God is
[45:58] going to refuse us forgiveness and I I I
[46:00] believe amen I have a deeper
[46:02] understanding of why it's like why why
[46:05] why is God saying if you don't forgive
[46:07] every man if you don't forgive your
[46:08] brother if you don't forgive everyone
[46:10] neither will I forgive you it seems like
[46:12] God's just saying hey if you don't get
[46:14] this perfect you don't get my
[46:18] forgiveness but to me I believe God
[46:20] understood how important forgiveness is
[46:22] because because unforgiveness brings
[46:25] bitterness yes and actually destroys our
[46:31] life amen and God's commandment is
[46:35] always for us never against
[46:37] us so this commandment of God is not
[46:40] saying I'm going to sit back and watch
[46:42] how you do I'm throwing everything at
[46:43] you every brother you got's going to be
[46:45] against you everything that could go
[46:47] wrong is going to go wrong and if you
[46:48] don't forgive one time you're
[46:51] finished that's not the point friends
[46:53] the point is he's saying for you to stay
[46:56] free you've got to forgive the way I
[46:58] forgive seven times a day seven time 70
[47:01] it doesn't matter how many times if you
[47:03] want to be like your father and if you
[47:05] want to remain free you better
[47:08] forgive because the best way to get
[47:10] yourself tied up emotionally is to
[47:12] refuse
[47:15] forgiveness and then it begins to
[47:19] destroy you the unforgiving person it
[47:23] destroys you on the
[47:24] inside brother B says in the morning
[47:26] Church age he said the only thing that
[47:29] the matter get all these little
[47:32] differences away from you little isms
[47:33] little funny feelings around you for
[47:36] Brethren and things like that shake it
[47:37] away don't let no root of bitterness
[47:40] ever get into your soul if you do it'll
[47:43] caner
[47:44] you I want to spend some time on this
[47:46] quote it'll canker you says right keep
[47:49] love I don't care how much people hate
[47:52] you you love them anyhow if you can't do
[47:55] that you you if you can't do that you
[47:57] ain't sealed you got a loose place yet
[48:00] so come on back and get that sealed up
[48:03] right good with the blood of Christ
[48:04] it'll cleanse you from all roots of
[48:08] bitterness so he's telling us that what
[48:11] the prophet told us now if you let a
[48:13] root of bitterness get in and how does
[48:15] bitterness come bitterness comes by an
[48:18] offense nobody wakes up in the morning
[48:21] and says I have decided I'm going to be
[48:23] bitter
[48:24] today never happened no little child
[48:27] just sudden all of a sudden says you
[48:28] know what I think I'm going to turn sour
[48:30] and turn bitter no it always happens
[48:33] because of an
[48:34] offense because something happens that
[48:36] wounds that Spirit realm and in that
[48:38] Spirit realm now there's an offense come
[48:40] and that offense amen becomes bitterness
[48:43] and brother bandam said it'll caner you
[48:46] yeah it'll canker you and so we've got
[48:50] if we want to stay free from being
[48:52] cankered and free from bitterness and
[48:54] all the effects of bitterness then we
[48:56] are going to have to stay in the realm
[48:57] of forgiving from the
[49:01] heart which I want to just bring back to
[49:03] your memory the most impossible kind of
[49:06] forgiveness without
[49:11] Christ
[49:14] amen
[49:17] so yeah praise
[49:19] God I'm going to draw some pictures is
[49:22] that okay amen I haven't used this
[49:25] whiteboard in a while and I I'm I'm not
[49:27] very good at it but I I just want to
[49:29] demonstrate some things just just I just
[49:33] want to share with you from my
[49:35] perspective as a pastor things I've seen
[49:37] things I've gone through things I've
[49:39] worked with people through things I've
[49:41] worked through
[49:43] myself and begin to understand how deep
[49:46] this issue is because it it affects our
[49:49] lives in the deepest
[49:53] ways if you ever met somebody
[49:57] that they seem all right but every once
[49:59] in a while they just flare
[50:01] up get upset over something that seems
[50:04] trivial something see small they get
[50:05] upset they get angry or they get
[50:07] reclusive they pull away and they go
[50:08] hide and they won't talk to you anymore
[50:11] and you don't know what you did you
[50:12] don't know what it was you ever I mean
[50:14] don't don't raise your hands you might
[50:15] be sitting next to that person
[50:17] but but we all know people like we've
[50:19] all been that way
[50:21] ourselves what you find see that's not
[50:24] the way people want to be people don't
[50:26] want to be
[50:27] in a situation where I said every time
[50:29] amen you do something to me I'm going to
[50:32] lash out at you or I'm going to pull
[50:33] away and refuse to be a friend I won't
[50:35] talk to you for a little while but but
[50:37] what's always at the bottom of that is
[50:39] there's been an offense
[50:41] there that spirit's been wounded and
[50:44] unbeknownst to you what you did is you
[50:46] just touched that spot yeah and what you
[50:49] did was not an anywhere equivalent to
[50:51] what happened to them years ago or what
[50:53] was the most hurtful thing in their life
[50:55] it wasn't an equivalent action but
[50:57] because they've never been healed and
[50:58] there's bitterness and there's a root of
[50:59] bitterness and it's cankered there
[51:01] because you just barely touched it that
[51:03] thing's been festering for years and
[51:05] every time you touch it you get a
[51:07] disproportionate
[51:09] response they lash out they get angry
[51:12] they won't talk to you for days they'll
[51:13] suck they'll pout they'll pull away
[51:16] they'll they'll they'll do whatever that
[51:17] they they're going to do and you realize
[51:19] right there there's a wounded Spirit
[51:21] right there right where I touch there's
[51:23] a wounded spirit because that's not
[51:26] normal that's not why how a whole
[51:28] healthy heart reacts to
[51:30] situations
[51:32] right amen so we see that we've all
[51:35] lived with these things but we need to
[51:38] get free from
[51:39] them have you ever had a situation where
[51:42] you say I don't know why I always
[51:44] overreact to this sort of
[51:47] situation I can't stand it when I see
[51:49] somebody left out if I see somebody say
[51:52] something heard somebody it makes me so
[51:54] mad you know that not
[51:57] normal it's normal to say I feel sorry
[52:00] for that that shouldn't have happened
[52:01] that was a bad but to get so angry
[52:03] something's
[52:05] wrong or if you feel rejected somebody
[52:08] criticize something you say and you want
[52:10] to pull away and not talk to anybody for
[52:12] a long time that's also not
[52:14] normal and you need to sometimes we need
[52:16] to ask ourselves Lord why am I
[52:18] overreacting to these
[52:19] situations what they did what my wife
[52:21] said really wasn't that bad what my
[52:23] husband said what what what this was
[52:25] wasn't that bad why do I get get so
[52:27] upset why do I get so angry why do I get
[52:30] so deeply
[52:32] hurt sometimes things are buried so deep
[52:34] inside of us we don't even understand
[52:36] why we're reacting the way we're
[52:38] reacting but I know somebody who knows
[52:40] our heart and everything that's ever
[52:41] happened to
[52:43] us and he's also the one who can reveal
[52:45] the secrets of our heart am and if we
[52:49] ask him with an honest heart say God I I
[52:51] want to be free from this I don't want
[52:53] to react this way anymore would you
[52:55] please come and show me why why I get so
[52:58] tripped up every time this happens why
[53:00] do I get so hurt or offended every time
[53:02] this happens what is it that's hurting
[53:04] me so bad
[53:06] yes and by the grace of God if he'll
[53:09] allow an open window into your heart
[53:10] you'll realize that there's something
[53:13] there that caused some damage some time
[53:15] ago and you're reacting to Old hurts not
[53:19] new
[53:22] hurts and I'm going to show you this is
[53:24] why forgiveness from the heart is so
[53:25] important
[53:28] if we if we just
[53:31] draw our little heart here so we all
[53:34] know what this is
[53:36] right
[53:39] beautiful and there's there's many times
[53:43] that we have Encounters in our life with
[53:47] people and these
[53:50] people wound our
[53:52] heart and because they wounded us
[53:56] we've got something inside that's been
[53:59] damaged and damage comes from
[54:04] people a damaged heart comes from a
[54:07] person do you know that Jesus didn't die
[54:10] of
[54:11] crucifixion he died of a broken
[54:14] heart so don't be ashamed that your
[54:17] heart's
[54:18] broken it's this this is our human
[54:21] existence this is our human
[54:23] life somebody wounds us
[54:28] and and it depends on how deep the wound
[54:32] how young we were how many times we're
[54:34] offended by the same person or the same
[54:36] circumstance but sometimes those wounds
[54:38] can go very very deep in our hearts some
[54:42] of the worst wounding is the wounding
[54:43] that took place when we were the
[54:44] tenderest in our lives when we were
[54:46] children the most impressionable and the
[54:48] most tender and that's when the deepest
[54:50] wounds come
[54:52] sometimes but what happens is when we
[54:55] get an offence
[54:57] we don't sometimes know what to do about
[54:59] this broken heart and now something
[55:01] inside of us is broke and we start to
[55:03] get bitter because this never should
[55:05] have happened to me they should not have
[55:08] mistreated me they should not have
[55:09] neglected me they should not have spoke
[55:11] that way they shouldn't have lied about
[55:12] me they shouldn't have done any Myriad
[55:14] of things that what somebody did to you
[55:16] they should never have done that to you
[55:18] Mom should have never said that Dad
[55:20] should have never done that Aunt Uncle
[55:22] friend they should have never said those
[55:23] things or done those things to me and so
[55:25] now there's an offense that come the
[55:27] offense caused the wound and now because
[55:29] we don't know what to do about it now we
[55:31] just focus on the wound and focus on the
[55:32] offense and a root of bitterness comes
[55:34] in and we start to get bitter towards
[55:36] the person who hurt us is that
[55:39] right and then we pass
[55:43] judgment
[55:44] now what I I just like to share this
[55:48] with you this is just human nature
[55:50] 101 all of us have a good sense of
[55:54] justice we all do
[55:57] there's something that's in human nature
[55:58] amen and it was passed down from God
[56:00] when man was made in the image of God
[56:02] and M in the flesh and now it's
[56:03] corrupted but there's a sense of justice
[56:05] that's inherent to us all and we realize
[56:08] amen there's an action and reaction a
[56:10] cause and effect and when somebody does
[56:12] wrong that they should
[56:13] pay when somebody does wrong something
[56:16] should
[56:17] happen we that does everybody have that
[56:19] sense of justice if you steal something
[56:22] from me you should get punished for that
[56:24] and you should restore that and you in
[56:25] the says you should restore it more than
[56:27] what you take amen there should be a
[56:29] punishment for your unjust deed so we
[56:32] all have this sense of justice even from
[56:34] the time we're children and we realize
[56:36] that this wrong deed something should
[56:38] happen they shouldn't be able to get
[56:40] away for that and you see the person
[56:42] going Free Living their life doing what
[56:43] they're doing and you're brokenhearted
[56:45] and you're wounded but there's no
[56:47] there's there's nobody to judge them
[56:49] there's nobody to make them pay there's
[56:51] nobody to fix the situation and give you
[56:54] any retribution so you're left with all
[56:56] the consequences of their action and
[56:58] they get to go free and inside of you
[57:00] because of a sense of justice you get
[57:03] bitter right and you get bitter because
[57:06] you've become the
[57:07] judge and you've judged this person
[57:14] guilty they're guilty what are they
[57:16] guilty of you name the offense neglect
[57:20] abuse abandonment lies you name the
[57:23] offense but we've all every one of us
[57:25] can name
[57:27] offenses every one of us but we in our
[57:31] spirit realm we deem them guilty and
[57:34] there's nobody coming to bat for us
[57:36] there's nobody coming to defend us
[57:38] there's nobody making them say they're
[57:39] sorry there's nobody making them fix the
[57:41] problem nothing's happening amen so we
[57:44] hold them in contempt and we hold them
[57:47] bound to their sin because we know that
[57:50] they're
[57:51] guilty and so because they're guilty we
[57:54] make a little chain
[57:58] look at this beautiful
[58:02] chain and this friends is one of the
[58:04] saddest things in the
[58:11] world and
[58:13] now we judge them
[58:15] guilty and we judge them worthy of
[58:18] punishment and we judge them deserving
[58:21] and because we judge them that way now
[58:24] in our heart we hold them in in our own
[58:26] little prison they're
[58:30] guilty the problem is we have no
[58:32] authority to enforce our
[58:35] judgment we pass judgment as a judge but
[58:38] we have no authority to enforce any
[58:40] judgment you can't make them say they're
[58:41] sorry you can't make them make it right
[58:43] you can't make them change their ways
[58:45] you can't stop it so what happens is we
[58:48] become bound to this person because of
[58:51] our guilty
[58:53] verdict and we want we want some somehow
[58:56] we want them to pay for what they've
[58:58] done because of the sense of justice
[58:59] that's in us and we not may not
[59:01] verbalize all of this but that's what's
[59:02] going on on the
[59:04] inside and then we take this hurt this
[59:07] wounded spirit this wound right
[59:13] here and this wound is our
[59:20] evidence this is our
[59:22] evidence that they did wrong
[59:26] now here's the saddest part of this
[59:28] whole
[59:29] thing because our wound in our spirit is
[59:32] evidence that they did me
[59:34] wrong until they come to judgment I can
[59:38] never get rid of this broken heart
[59:41] because I can't get rid of the evidence
[59:43] that they're
[59:45] guilty so God can never take it from me
[59:49] because I haven't forgiven them I hold
[59:51] them in contempt and hold them guilty
[59:53] and I have to have an Evidence to why
[59:55] they're guilty in the hurt is my
[59:56] evidence so I can never turn loose of my
[59:59] hurt cuz if I turn loose of my hurt I
[1:00:00] have no evidence that they're guilty
[1:00:03] yeah and what does this hurt do it
[1:00:07] caners it brings
[1:00:09] bitterness it gets and the longer it
[1:00:11] goes the worst it gets and we try to
[1:00:13] bury it and we bury it and we bury it
[1:00:15] but it never ever goes away because we
[1:00:18] want somebody to make them pay for what
[1:00:20] they did to me that's the inherent sense
[1:00:22] of justice in every human being
[1:00:26] and so I can never be free completely
[1:00:28] free from this pain because the moment I
[1:00:30] turn loose of the pain I've turned loose
[1:00:33] of their
[1:00:34] guilt and I can't do that because they
[1:00:37] have to pay somebody has to pay because
[1:00:40] I'm
[1:00:43] suffering I hope you're seeing why
[1:00:45] forgiveness is so important you'll never
[1:00:48] be free until you learn to forgive from
[1:00:51] the heart you'll be bound by something
[1:00:54] your whole life and you'll continually
[1:00:56] be falling into this trap of
[1:00:58] overreacting to something or having uh
[1:01:00] you'll have relationships that go good
[1:01:01] for a while until somebody does
[1:01:03] something like this person did long ago
[1:01:06] and when they do something similar to
[1:01:07] what this person did Bam that's it that
[1:01:09] breaks the relationship causes a tension
[1:01:11] causes a disagreement causes me to pull
[1:01:13] away and then you go from one
[1:01:15] relationship to another relationship to
[1:01:16] another relationship one one one work
[1:01:18] situ start fine I go to a new job and
[1:01:21] they all my friends and all of a sudden
[1:01:22] the same thing that happened at the old
[1:01:24] workplace happens at this place and the
[1:01:25] the whole thing falls apart I go to a
[1:01:27] different church and the same thing that
[1:01:28] happen that church it's amazing how the
[1:01:30] same things keep happening to you over
[1:01:32] and over again even though you change
[1:01:33] scenarios you change
[1:01:38] locations changing locations won't
[1:01:40] change this amen changing friends won't
[1:01:43] change this changing relations won't
[1:01:45] change this it will eventually come out
[1:01:47] again and it'll happen again there'll be
[1:01:50] a cycle to everything starts off good
[1:01:52] doesn't last forever get in trouble and
[1:01:54] then we start to cycle over again change
[1:01:56] the situation change the scenery change
[1:01:58] the friends change the people change the
[1:01:59] names and we go right back to the same
[1:02:03] cycle I'm not the only one who's been
[1:02:05] through the cycle a few times am
[1:02:08] I same exact thing because until we get
[1:02:11] rid of what calls the root of bitterness
[1:02:14] we're never going to get rid of the
[1:02:15] problem and the problem is we can't get
[1:02:17] rid of the problem because we can't let
[1:02:20] somebody
[1:02:24] go and God can't take this from
[1:02:28] us when we're holding it as evidence
[1:02:31] against
[1:02:34] guilt because we need
[1:02:36] it as evidence against
[1:02:40] guilt and it comes to the place where
[1:02:43] now we like the
[1:02:48] hurt you say no way we like the hurt
[1:02:52] because the hurt justifies our wrong
[1:02:55] action attitude towards the
[1:02:57] person and without the hurt I have no
[1:03:00] right to be angry I have no right to be
[1:03:02] offended I have no right yeah so I all
[1:03:05] of a sudden protect my hurt yeah and
[1:03:09] then every time I meet a new friend all
[1:03:11] I do is talk about the old hurt what my
[1:03:13] mom did what my dad did what they did
[1:03:15] what my last Pastor did what what my
[1:03:17] brother or sister did what my co-work
[1:03:20] then in every new relationship has to
[1:03:22] hear all the details of the old hurt
[1:03:26] every new one we've got to rehearse it
[1:03:28] every new person we come in contact with
[1:03:29] it won't take long till it all comes out
[1:03:31] again that's right it's because we're
[1:03:34] holding on to it as the justification
[1:03:37] for our guilty
[1:03:40] verdict the trouble that we have is you
[1:03:44] see that
[1:03:45] chain no matter how much you're upset
[1:03:48] with that person angry with them want to
[1:03:50] get away from them and don't want them
[1:03:51] have any involvement in your life again
[1:03:53] you'll never ever be free from that
[1:03:55] person because your guilty verdict
[1:03:57] caused you to be attached to that person
[1:03:59] because you have to hold them in guilt
[1:04:01] Forever Until the righteous judgment
[1:04:03] comes the punishment comes so you are
[1:04:05] absolutely attached to that person and
[1:04:07] you will never be free from them that's
[1:04:09] why this person can be six feet under
[1:04:11] the ground and you've got a chain going
[1:04:13] right down to their casket attached to
[1:04:15] your heart and you can never get over
[1:04:17] what a dead person did to you 50 years
[1:04:19] ago and you're still affected in life
[1:04:22] today by somebody that's in a casket
[1:04:27] death won't even separate you from this
[1:04:29] hurs death won't even break this chain
[1:04:33] and you'll walk around with bitterness
[1:04:34] and our hurt and we walk around nursing
[1:04:36] this because it's our justification for
[1:04:38] being mad at my mom who died 10 years
[1:04:41] ago and she's dead she can't pay she
[1:04:46] can't say she's sorry she can't make it
[1:04:48] right she can't change anything and
[1:04:51] because you want somebody to make it
[1:04:52] right and you want her to be guilty and
[1:04:53] you want restitution you'll never never
[1:04:55] have it and you live the rest of your
[1:04:57] life getting more and more bitter
[1:04:58] because there's no hope for
[1:05:05] restitution one of the other problems we
[1:05:07] have is a heart is meant to give
[1:05:11] love and meant to receive
[1:05:14] love so we have other
[1:05:17] relationships let's say we have another
[1:05:20] relationship
[1:05:23] here we have another relationship over
[1:05:27] here we have relationships maybe with a
[1:05:31] group of people over
[1:05:39] here and these people we're attached to
[1:05:42] we want to love we want we want to give
[1:05:45] love and receive love and we want to
[1:05:46] have right sound
[1:05:48] relationships but the problem is if one
[1:05:50] of these people in these relationships
[1:05:52] touch this
[1:05:54] spot right there
[1:05:56] we cut them
[1:05:59] off because you can't touch that spot
[1:06:02] it's too painful brings back too many
[1:06:06] memories and the problem is you can
[1:06:08] never let's just say it this way you can
[1:06:11] never keep bitterness focused towards
[1:06:14] the person who first made you
[1:06:17] bitter we think I'm just upset at dad
[1:06:21] because Dad neglected us he left us he
[1:06:23] abandoned us and I'm upset at dad the
[1:06:25] problem is you can't keep bitterness
[1:06:28] only directed towards
[1:06:31] dad because if anybody else comes and
[1:06:33] does anything similar to what Dad did
[1:06:36] amen you get the same bitterness you're
[1:06:37] holding towards dad pops out towards
[1:06:39] them yeah and so this old hurt is
[1:06:42] affecting every other relationship in
[1:06:44] our life because you cannot and I I
[1:06:46] promise you this you cannot keep
[1:06:48] bitterness focused towards the person
[1:06:49] you're bitter
[1:06:51] towards it will come
[1:06:54] out that's why sometimes you talk to
[1:06:56] people and you get in a in a situation
[1:06:58] and may become tense and there may be
[1:06:59] some stress involved and you say
[1:07:01] something to somebody and they blow up
[1:07:02] and they storm out the door and you're
[1:07:03] saying what did I
[1:07:05] say well it's not really what you said
[1:07:07] it's what they never got over from long
[1:07:10] ago and you said something in similar
[1:07:12] fashion or reminded them or touched a
[1:07:14] pain point and all of a sudden you have
[1:07:15] an explosion or you have a withdrawal or
[1:07:17] you have a cut off relationship and
[1:07:18] you're sitting there wondering what in
[1:07:19] the world did I do what was it and you
[1:07:21] don't realize it's not you they're
[1:07:23] bitter towards mom and dad they're
[1:07:24] bitter towards friends they're bitter
[1:07:26] towards somebody else but they can't
[1:07:28] keep that bitterness focused that way
[1:07:30] amen it's got to pop out everywhere else
[1:07:33] and then we're always somebody in this
[1:07:35] situation is always trying to go around
[1:07:36] mend
[1:07:37] relationships touch stuff up mend
[1:07:39] relationships have a little discour
[1:07:41] discussion here have a little Fallout
[1:07:43] here and they're constantly and what
[1:07:44] they're doing is they're trying to whack
[1:07:46] off the weeds that are popping out the
[1:07:48] spirit realm and now I had a little
[1:07:50] dispute with this one and I had a little
[1:07:51] misunderstanding or I withdrawal from
[1:07:52] this and we whack it off but we never
[1:07:54] get to the root of the bitterness where
[1:07:56] it actually came from to pluck that
[1:07:58] thing out by the
[1:08:00] roots and that's what we
[1:08:04] need we need that thing to be
[1:08:08] gone amen I'm going to go back here and
[1:08:11] look at a few more things and then we'll
[1:08:13] come
[1:08:17] back so
[1:08:20] now what's the path to
[1:08:23] Freedom what do what can we do about
[1:08:25] this
[1:08:26] situation and I hope every one of you
[1:08:29] can find yourself in here
[1:08:30] somewhere level one level 10
[1:08:33] somewhere what do we do about this
[1:08:35] situation there's actually only one
[1:08:38] thing that you can do to go free and
[1:08:40] that's forgive the guilty
[1:08:42] party it's the only thing there's
[1:08:45] nothing else you can do to ever be free
[1:08:47] there's not enough church services you
[1:08:48] can attend not enough Good Deeds you can
[1:08:50] do not enough prayers you can pray there
[1:08:52] is nothing you can do to be free the
[1:08:55] only only thing that will give you
[1:08:56] freedom from this situation is
[1:08:58] forgiveness you have to forgive the
[1:09:00] guilty party now realize you can only
[1:09:04] forgive somebody who's
[1:09:07] guilty you cannot forgive somebody who's
[1:09:09] not guilty if they're not guilty there's
[1:09:12] no forgiveness needed so if they're
[1:09:14] guilty the only way that you can deal
[1:09:16] with their guilt is through forgiveness
[1:09:18] remember because you don't have the
[1:09:20] authority to enforce your guilty verdict
[1:09:23] and because you don't have the authority
[1:09:25] to enforce your guilty verdict the only
[1:09:27] way to be free from this situation is to
[1:09:29] forgive them right amen amen praise God
[1:09:34] and so now how do I get free how do I
[1:09:36] forgive let's turn to Colossians chapter
[1:09:38] 3
[1:09:42] together I I hope that today we can get
[1:09:44] down to nuts and bolts of forgiveness to
[1:09:47] the actual practical working the how how
[1:09:50] I'm in this situation how do I get out
[1:09:52] of this situation I've been in these
[1:09:53] Cycles how do I stop these Cycles Les
[1:09:56] that's right Colossians
[1:10:00] 3 Colossians
[1:10:07] 3:12 he says Colossians 3:12 put on
[1:10:10] therefore on the elect of God as the
[1:10:12] elect of God holy and beloved bows of
[1:10:14] Mercy kindness humbleness of Mind
[1:10:16] meekness longsuffering forbearing one
[1:10:18] another and forgiving one another If any
[1:10:21] man have a quarrel against any even as
[1:10:23] Christ forgave you so also do ye I just
[1:10:28] like for you to
[1:10:29] note even as Christ so what is the way
[1:10:33] to forgive I have to forgive even as
[1:10:36] Christ so that means I have to forgive
[1:10:39] the same way Christ forgave yeah so I
[1:10:42] have to forgive others the same way he
[1:10:44] forgave me so let's look at Ephesians
[1:10:47] now let's turn back to Ephesians chapter
[1:10:49] 4
[1:10:55] Ephesians chapter
[1:11:02] 4 Ephesians
[1:11:08] 4:31 it says let all bitterness and
[1:11:11] wrath and anger and clamor and evil
[1:11:12] speaking be put away from you with all
[1:11:14] malice and be you kind one to another
[1:11:17] tender-hearted forgiving one another
[1:11:19] even as God for Christ's sake hath
[1:11:21] forgiven you so here is our model how do
[1:11:25] I forgive I have to forgive the same way
[1:11:29] I was forgiven by
[1:11:31] God so we're going to look at how God
[1:11:33] forgave me because that's the model
[1:11:35] that's the model I will model to forgive
[1:11:38] others now let's turn to Romans really
[1:11:40] quick and pick up another scripture
[1:11:42] Romans chapter
[1:11:50] 5 Romans chapter 5
[1:11:59] in verse 8 Romans 5
[1:12:05] and8 says but God commanded his love
[1:12:08] toward us and that while we were yet
[1:12:11] sinners Christ died for
[1:12:14] us I ask you a
[1:12:18] question did God forgive you while you
[1:12:21] were a debtor or after you made
[1:12:24] everything right
[1:12:26] he forgave us when we were in sin when
[1:12:28] being yet sinners he died for us he paid
[1:12:31] the price for us he forgave us he
[1:12:33] forgave us before we
[1:12:34] asked when Jesus was nailed to the cross
[1:12:37] and he looked out at all those who had
[1:12:39] offended him and they were mocking they
[1:12:41] were deriding they were making comments
[1:12:43] they were they were jeering and teasing
[1:12:45] and laughing and right in the midst of
[1:12:47] the crucifixion he said
[1:12:50] father forgive them because they don't
[1:12:53] know what they're doing
[1:12:55] amen he didn't wait for them to make it
[1:12:57] right he didn't ask them to come and
[1:12:59] apologize he
[1:13:02] forgave when they didn't say they were
[1:13:04] sorry he forgave before they could
[1:13:07] repent he forgave them before they could
[1:13:09] make restitution he forgave them while
[1:13:12] they were in their
[1:13:14] sins and how am I supposed to forgive
[1:13:17] even as Christ forgave
[1:13:19] me amen that's the way that I'm supposed
[1:13:22] to forgive
[1:13:25] I want to read this quote from brother
[1:13:27] banham out of the Great Commission from
[1:13:29] 1958 and I want you just we're going to
[1:13:31] talk about forgiving from the heart now
[1:13:33] not from the head not with the mouth but
[1:13:35] forgiving from the heart says he says if
[1:13:39] I have found Grace in your sight through
[1:13:41] God you take my word for this Brethren
[1:13:43] if you want to be a blessing and get a
[1:13:45] blessing when a man has done you wrong
[1:13:46] and as absolutely justly I mean he has
[1:13:49] done you wrong and you know that he's
[1:13:51] done you wrong he's done you evil don't
[1:13:53] mention that you take him to prayer
[1:13:56] before God and don't take it in the way
[1:13:59] of just a selfish say well I'm supposed
[1:14:01] to do this why cuz that's not from the
[1:14:04] heart can't do it as a ritual you can't
[1:14:07] do it as a form and you can't do it as a
[1:14:10] commandment alone you have to do it from
[1:14:12] the heart so I'm going read that again
[1:14:14] don't take it in a way of just a selfish
[1:14:16] say well I'm supposed to do this but
[1:14:17] stand with your shoulder to his shoulder
[1:14:20] and stand in the presence of God our
[1:14:22] Father way a prayer should be made in
[1:14:24] the presence of God say father here's my
[1:14:26] brother he is just he deserves
[1:14:29] punishment because he has done me evil
[1:14:32] and I don't see why he did
[1:14:34] it it's just being
[1:14:36] honest listen what one of the first
[1:14:39] steps to forgiveness is to be
[1:14:42] honest just be
[1:14:44] honest don't so many times we're afraid
[1:14:47] to deal in the Realms of forgiveness
[1:14:48] because we don't actually want to be
[1:14:50] honest about what's happened we smooth
[1:14:53] everything over and say well you know
[1:14:55] long time ago mom didn't understand dad
[1:14:57] didn't understand and that's fine but
[1:14:59] remember you can only forgive people who
[1:15:01] are
[1:15:02] guilty yeah there's no forgiveness for
[1:15:04] somebody who's not guilty so if you're
[1:15:06] going to forgive somebody they actually
[1:15:08] have to be guilty yeah remember somebody
[1:15:11] come to brother bam said brother bham
[1:15:12] you know such and such a night over
[1:15:13] there I saw you you were out with
[1:15:15] somebody you took a drink and I saw you
[1:15:16] drink but I forgive you for that and
[1:15:18] brother bam said it wasn't me I was
[1:15:19] never there you can't forgive me I never
[1:15:21] did it right amen so we're sometimes
[1:15:25] were so afraid to be honest about my
[1:15:27] husband did this to me my mother did
[1:15:29] this to me my father somehow we think
[1:15:32] that and declaring that we're somehow uh
[1:15:35] uh selling them out or we're not being
[1:15:37] nice or we're but it it's just the truth
[1:15:40] yeah it's just the truth we have to
[1:15:42] identify what happened and who did it
[1:15:44] there's no Freedom until we can identify
[1:15:46] what happened and who did
[1:15:48] it my friend my mother my father my
[1:15:53] uncle my brother my sister they did this
[1:15:57] to me and it was wrong God I don't know
[1:15:59] why they did it it was wrong but God I
[1:16:02] want to forgive them from my heart
[1:16:04] really you can't forgive until they're
[1:16:06] guilty and you have to know who it is
[1:16:09] and what they're guilty of before you
[1:16:10] can
[1:16:14] forgive and this is just so to start
[1:16:16] with you have to just get honest quit
[1:16:19] sweeping stuff under the rug quit acting
[1:16:21] like it didn't bother you quit acting
[1:16:23] like it was no big deal but get down
[1:16:24] down to the reality of it and said when
[1:16:26] this happened when I was a little boy
[1:16:27] when that happened when we were first
[1:16:28] married when this happened in the church
[1:16:30] it destroyed me on the inside and this
[1:16:32] person said this and this person did
[1:16:34] that and it broke something inside of me
[1:16:36] that's never been right
[1:16:38] since start with the truth start with
[1:16:41] the reality and quit pretending there's
[1:16:43] not a problem and quit pretending nobody
[1:16:45] did anything
[1:16:47] wrong start with reality and the truth
[1:16:50] and say this
[1:16:52] happened but I want to forgive them
[1:16:56] you take them shoulder Tosh shoulder
[1:16:58] you're not there to ask God to destroy
[1:16:59] them and lightning bolts no this is a
[1:17:01] totally different situation I'm coming
[1:17:03] with my brother shoulder-to-shoulder cuz
[1:17:06] I need Deliverance amen I need to be
[1:17:08] free and the only way I'll be free is if
[1:17:10] I find a way to make them free and when
[1:17:12] I make them free I'll be free and if
[1:17:14] they don't go free I'll never be free
[1:17:18] amen father here's my brother he justly
[1:17:21] he deserves punishment because he's done
[1:17:23] me evil and I don't see why why he did
[1:17:25] it then let go let God go to talking to
[1:17:30] you and you'll see maybe what that man's
[1:17:33] been through the devil has Twisted him
[1:17:35] up somewhere caused him to do that
[1:17:37] though he's absolutely wrong before you
[1:17:40] leave the Throne of God you'll be
[1:17:41] feeling sorry for that man you'll be
[1:17:45] sympathizing with that brother and when
[1:17:47] you get back down on Earth you'll go
[1:17:49] over to that brother shake his hand cuz
[1:17:51] you know what he's been through you
[1:17:52] can't stand with a mortal in the Pres
[1:17:54] presence of God and condemn anybody I
[1:17:57] don't believe no sir even if he's a rank
[1:18:01] Sinner and what about a brother that has
[1:18:03] made a mistake though I say he's wrong
[1:18:06] sometimes he's accused wrong when he's
[1:18:07] not wrong but if he's wrong well if if
[1:18:09] we will take him to the throne of God
[1:18:11] stand there shoulder-to-shoulder with
[1:18:12] our brother knowing he's Immortal and
[1:18:14] maybe his destination rest upon our
[1:18:17] attitude towards
[1:18:18] him think about
[1:18:20] that when we come back from the Throne
[1:18:23] of God we'll realize I that we're
[1:18:25] everyone guilty and we all need help one
[1:18:27] from another and the best way to do is
[1:18:30] to
[1:18:31] pray you know we can't just go through
[1:18:35] the motion and say well I forgive this
[1:18:36] is what happened I forgive no we
[1:18:38] actually got to go like brother BR said
[1:18:40] shoulder-to-shoulder before the Throne
[1:18:42] of God and and we've got to stand there
[1:18:44] until God does a work in our heart and
[1:18:47] listen I've been through this before
[1:18:48] with things that have happened to me
[1:18:49] that absolutely were so some of the most
[1:18:52] hurtful things in my life and I'll tell
[1:18:54] you for it wasn't the first prayer I got
[1:18:56] free and it wasn't the second prayer I
[1:18:58] got free but I had to keep going back to
[1:19:00] God until from my heart I could forgive
[1:19:03] the one who created the
[1:19:05] offense because until then I could never
[1:19:07] be free and then I started to find out
[1:19:10] how is it that I know that I've forgiven
[1:19:12] like I I I I I I I say I forgive I pray
[1:19:15] I go to God and say God Amen help me
[1:19:17] forgive from my heart I forgive them and
[1:19:19] you get up and and I'll tell you how you
[1:19:21] know amen when you go back and when you
[1:19:24] think about that situation and all the
[1:19:26] same anger and frustration and hurt
[1:19:27] feelings come back it's not done yet
[1:19:30] it's not done
[1:19:32] yet go back
[1:19:35] again go back again until you're
[1:19:40] free because when you let them go free
[1:19:43] you'll be
[1:19:46] free until you let them go free you'll
[1:19:49] have to hold the evidence of their guilt
[1:19:52] and you can't let it go
[1:19:55] so when you're not free now what's it
[1:19:58] feel like to be free I can tell you
[1:20:00] because God's freed
[1:20:02] me when I can look back on that
[1:20:04] situation and I can talk about it and it
[1:20:06] doesn't bring the same old hurts it
[1:20:08] doesn't bring anger it doesn't bring I
[1:20:09] just see it as a situation that happened
[1:20:11] in my life and I can even say it was
[1:20:14] negative it was bad it shouldn't have
[1:20:15] happened it was wrong but it doesn't
[1:20:17] bring all those same emotions up in me
[1:20:19] and when I look at the brother all of a
[1:20:20] sudden I can see I can like brother said
[1:20:23] feel sorry
[1:20:25] yeah amen I could be like Jesus on
[1:20:29] Calvary and say you know what they had
[1:20:31] no idea what they were doing to me yeah
[1:20:34] they didn't they didn't understand they
[1:20:36] didn't know they didn't know how deeply
[1:20:38] I'm hurt they don't know how badly I'm
[1:20:39] wounded they don't know how deep this
[1:20:41] scar goes oh God they don't understand
[1:20:45] and when I can start to actually feel
[1:20:47] sorry for the perpetrator and see
[1:20:49] through their eyes that maybe they
[1:20:51] didn't understand and it wasn't exactly
[1:20:52] the way I saw and they didn't mean to do
[1:20:54] it it wasn't on purpose and it wasn't
[1:20:55] intentional and maybe they reacted
[1:20:57] because of things that happened to them
[1:20:59] when they were a kid as soon as I can
[1:21:00] see that picture I'm free yeah I'm free
[1:21:04] because now I'm not saying they're
[1:21:05] guilty they're bad they're the enemy
[1:21:07] they're Wicked they hurt me they must
[1:21:09] pay now all of a sudden I can say no
[1:21:11] they they hurt me because they were
[1:21:14] hurt they were they went through this
[1:21:16] and they went through that and all of a
[1:21:18] sudden compassion starts to come in your
[1:21:19] heart and you're like Jesus on the cross
[1:21:22] father forgive them they don't know what
[1:21:23] they're doing they literally have no
[1:21:25] idea what they're doing they're deceived
[1:21:27] they're blinded they're wounded they're
[1:21:30] hurt that's Freedom
[1:21:33] friends that's
[1:21:38] Freedom when we have to
[1:21:41] forgive the same way that we were
[1:21:45] forgiven which means I have to forgive
[1:21:47] before they
[1:21:49] ask brother said in the message look he
[1:21:51] said if you can focus your camera till
[1:21:53] you see that and know it cost the life
[1:21:55] of God himself when he made his life
[1:21:58] here he didn't have to give up he laid
[1:22:00] it down freely he was God he didn't have
[1:22:02] to die but he did it freely give his own
[1:22:05] life that he might bring Sons to him
[1:22:08] that his work might continue
[1:22:12] on John 3:16 Says God so loved the world
[1:22:15] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:22:18] whosoever believe in him should not
[1:22:19] perish but of everlasting life God so
[1:22:23] loved he gave
[1:22:25] Christ gave up his life for our
[1:22:27] forgiveness he shed his blood so that we
[1:22:29] could go
[1:22:32] free Ephesians 1:7 says in whom we have
[1:22:35] Redemption through his blood the
[1:22:37] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:22:38] riches of his grace says in Colossians
[1:22:41] 1:14 in whom we have Redemption through
[1:22:43] his blood even the Forgiveness of
[1:22:48] sins so how were we
[1:22:52] forgiven we were forgiven for given
[1:22:55] while we were in our sin while we were
[1:22:58] wrong before we had a chance to make it
[1:23:00] right we were
[1:23:04] forgiven I'm just going to draw another
[1:23:07] picture for
[1:23:09] you draw the same the same
[1:23:15] heart and the same
[1:23:21] chain to our offender
[1:23:32] we want to have the same
[1:23:39] wound you know what we want to get free
[1:23:42] from this
[1:23:44] wound but in order for me to
[1:23:48] forgive this
[1:23:49] offender the
[1:23:51] guilty let's make him guilty again
[1:23:58] do you realize that our sense of justice
[1:24:00] that we're born with cannot just let
[1:24:03] somebody go
[1:24:04] free we know there's something wrong
[1:24:07] with
[1:24:08] that I know that that sounds
[1:24:10] counterintuitive to what I'm saying but
[1:24:12] it's the truth sometimes we have such a
[1:24:14] hard time forgiving because we know that
[1:24:17] this isn't right it's not Justice it's
[1:24:20] not just that nobody pays it's not just
[1:24:24] that there's no consequences for Action
[1:24:25] that's not right how many believe it's
[1:24:28] not right that there's no consequences
[1:24:29] for Action we know it we know it
[1:24:32] intuitively it doesn't have to be taught
[1:24:34] to us we understand that and so we have
[1:24:37] such a hard time sometimes forgetting
[1:24:39] forgiving because inside it goes against
[1:24:42] the grain of what we are how can
[1:24:44] somebody go with no consequences for
[1:24:46] action with no payment for wrongdoing
[1:24:48] with no suffering and they just get to
[1:24:50] go free but
[1:24:51] now it's not right it's not right and
[1:24:54] the truth is no forgiveness is free
[1:24:58] none nobody goes free
[1:25:01] nobody there is always a price to pay
[1:25:05] for forgiveness remember that I want you
[1:25:07] to lock that in your mind there is
[1:25:09] always a price to pay for
[1:25:11] forgiveness now let's let's look at our
[1:25:14] situation here we've got somebody who's
[1:25:16] wounded us deeply they've scarred us and
[1:25:18] it was a horrible scar amen we're
[1:25:20] dealing with it we've got bitterness
[1:25:21] we've got all kinds of problems that are
[1:25:22] Fallout this I need to get free in order
[1:25:24] to go free I have to forgive them but
[1:25:26] I've got to forgive them from my heart
[1:25:28] so I've got to go to God and say God
[1:25:30] would you please let me see this
[1:25:32] situation better and give me a heart
[1:25:34] that I can forgive the way you forgive
[1:25:36] and then when you want to turn that
[1:25:38] person free listen that's why I said I
[1:25:39] want to get to the nuts and bolts of
[1:25:41] forgiveness today because forgiveness is
[1:25:43] reality forgiveness is powerful
[1:25:45] forgiveness is
[1:25:46] just it's just
[1:25:55] I'll ask you this
[1:25:57] question I'm just trying to get this
[1:25:59] principle across I hope you can catch it
[1:26:02] when the when the master had the servant
[1:26:05] that owed him 10,000 talents and that he
[1:26:06] he begged for forgiveness when he was
[1:26:08] going to sell his wife and his children
[1:26:09] and he says he frankly he he let him
[1:26:11] loose he freed him and forgave him of
[1:26:14] his
[1:26:17] debt what was the cost of that man's
[1:26:22] freedom because it wasn't free right
[1:26:25] yeah it cost somebody 10,000
[1:26:28] talents who did it
[1:26:31] cost cost the
[1:26:35] victim somebody lost 10,000
[1:26:39] Talons that was the price of that man's
[1:26:44] forgiveness forgiveness is never
[1:26:48] free ever am somebody pays because you
[1:26:53] can't be forgiven unless you're
[1:26:59] guilty so let's say we want this
[1:27:02] situation to change in our lives we want
[1:27:04] this offender who is guilty and we know
[1:27:07] what he's guilty from he's from whatever
[1:27:10] he did to cause this broken break in my
[1:27:12] heart he's guilty of
[1:27:14] that so we we understand we've been
[1:27:17] honest we've been real this person did
[1:27:19] this and left me in this
[1:27:21] situation so I'm going to ask you what
[1:27:23] is the the price of this man's
[1:27:25] forgiveness the price is this
[1:27:34] wound somebody has to pay for somebody
[1:27:38] to go
[1:27:39] free did somebody pay for me to go free
[1:27:43] who paid how did he pay he bore my sins
[1:27:46] upon himself and he was suffering
[1:27:49] because of me it was me who deserved the
[1:27:52] stripes it was me who deserved the
[1:27:53] mocking it was me who deserve the
[1:27:55] beating it was me he took my place and
[1:27:58] all those wounds were on him were wounds
[1:28:00] that I placed on him because of my
[1:28:02] transgression and my sins amen but he
[1:28:06] took all the pain and he took it as
[1:28:10] payment for my
[1:28:12] forgiveness and he said father forgive
[1:28:15] them they don't know what they're doing
[1:28:17] remember God is just as well God a just
[1:28:21] God couldn't just let us go free amen
[1:28:23] without something without retribution
[1:28:25] God is also just and to remain just he
[1:28:28] can't just say willy-nilly okay you go
[1:28:30] free no in order for you to go free
[1:28:32] somebody has to pay the price for your
[1:28:34] crimes who paid the price Jesus Christ
[1:28:37] paid the price and when he paid the
[1:28:39] price willingly and forgave me now I'm
[1:28:41] free because God's justice is met amen
[1:28:45] this is inherent inside of us we know
[1:28:47] you can't just go free no I'm not just
[1:28:49] turning them free what I'm doing is I'm
[1:28:51] paying for their freedom with this pain
[1:28:54] that's locked up inside of my heart they
[1:28:56] did it they did it unjustly they did it
[1:28:58] to me and now I'm suffering with
[1:29:00] bitterness and hurt and complexes and
[1:29:02] fears and all this stuff that I have
[1:29:04] inside of me but I realized that Jesus
[1:29:06] had all kinds of things placed on him
[1:29:09] because of me and if he can forgive me
[1:29:11] bearing my shame then I can forgive them
[1:29:13] bearing the consequences for their sin I
[1:29:16] have to forgive the same way I was
[1:29:19] forgiven this is forgiveness nobody gets
[1:29:22] off free somebody
[1:29:28] pays now the question is can I be like
[1:29:31] my father yes right can I pay the
[1:29:36] price for the guilty party's
[1:29:39] Freedom can I yes can I say you don't
[1:29:44] owe me
[1:29:46] anything you don't owe me an apology you
[1:29:50] don't have to make it right you don't
[1:29:52] have to pay me back you don't have to
[1:29:54] send letters to everybody you slandered
[1:29:55] my name against you don't have to do any
[1:29:58] I am letting you go completely free
[1:30:06] am when we willingly accept
[1:30:12] this we break
[1:30:16] this and we separate
[1:30:19] ourselves from this chain and this
[1:30:21] bondage we've dragged around all of our
[1:30:23] lives
[1:30:26] now this person is completely free they
[1:30:28] don't owe me
[1:30:31] anything they don't owe me an apology a
[1:30:36] letter a Christmas card a handshake they
[1:30:40] owe me
[1:30:41] nothing this is
[1:30:43] forgiveness this is true
[1:30:46] forgiveness but in order for them to go
[1:30:48] free now I'm left holding the
[1:30:52] bag just like the the wealthy ruler was
[1:30:54] left holding the $10,000
[1:30:58] loss and he could hold a $10,000 loss
[1:31:01] and let a servant Go free and that
[1:31:03] servant couldn't take a 100 Pence
[1:31:06] loss to let his fellow servant Go
[1:31:09] free Jesus could take all of our sins
[1:31:12] upon him and we can't take a brother
[1:31:14] saying something against us we can't
[1:31:16] take uh somebody forgetting us or or
[1:31:18] somebody stipping on our toes or
[1:31:20] somebody saying something about us we
[1:31:21] can't take a 100 Pence off fence with
[1:31:23] without getting bitter and angry and
[1:31:25] holding them in contempt when Jesus Took
[1:31:26] the whole load of the sins of the world
[1:31:28] upon himself so that we could go
[1:31:31] free you see how important this is and
[1:31:35] how deep it actually
[1:31:39] is so this is the process this is
[1:31:43] forgiveness forgiveness starts with
[1:31:45] honesty Lord this brother this sister
[1:31:48] this parent this they did this to me and
[1:31:54] when they did this it had this effect on
[1:31:56] me and Here I Am Lord wanting with all
[1:32:00] my heart to forgive them so they go free
[1:32:03] and I want to forgive them the way you
[1:32:04] forgave me but Lord I need your help
[1:32:07] because I'm really
[1:32:09] hurt and I'll tell you the next step
[1:32:13] Lord I'm willing to accept all the
[1:32:16] consequences for their
[1:32:20] actions so that they can go free
[1:32:25] guess what in reality they can never
[1:32:27] make it right
[1:32:28] anyways what if they're already
[1:32:30] dead what if the person you're hurt at
[1:32:33] most in the world is already dead what
[1:32:35] if they live in another country another
[1:32:37] state what if there's no communication
[1:32:39] no you're already holding the bag
[1:32:42] friends you're holding it as evidence of
[1:32:44] their guilt now why don't you hold it
[1:32:46] differently why don't you hold it as
[1:32:48] payment for their
[1:32:52] freedom say Lord I'm willing I'm not
[1:32:54] asking anymore for you to make them
[1:32:57] pay see our superficial forgiveness is
[1:33:01] like this I forgive you but in your mind
[1:33:04] wait till God gets
[1:33:08] you or I forgive you brother that's all
[1:33:11] right I forgive you but oh God's going
[1:33:14] to get
[1:33:16] you that's the wrong forgiveness that's
[1:33:20] not forgiving from the heart forgiving
[1:33:23] from the heart heart now com
[1:33:24] shoulder-to-shoulder with the brother
[1:33:25] and say God this is forgiveness listen
[1:33:28] this is the reality
[1:33:30] friends God I'm willing to bear the
[1:33:34] consequences for their action as payment
[1:33:36] for their
[1:33:38] release and I'm not asking you to punish
[1:33:41] them to make them pay set them free and
[1:33:44] don't judge them because of me because I
[1:33:47] forgive
[1:33:48] them and in that kind of forgiveness now
[1:33:52] you've become the intercessor and you
[1:33:54] stood in the Gap if you're going to take
[1:33:55] the consequences for their action then
[1:33:57] you're going to take the consequences
[1:33:58] for their action you're not going to
[1:33:59] pretend to take the consequences for
[1:34:01] Action hoping that God makes them pay
[1:34:02] for their actions that's not bearing the
[1:34:04] price of their
[1:34:05] forgiveness that's superficial that's
[1:34:08] mental that's not the reality the
[1:34:10] reality is I'm not going to ask God to
[1:34:12] make them pay either I hope they don't
[1:34:13] have to pay I set them free and I want
[1:34:15] them to go free I want them to prosper I
[1:34:17] want them to be happy they have no more
[1:34:19] obligation to me and God please don't
[1:34:22] judge them for what they did to me
[1:34:23] because I forgive them for what they did
[1:34:26] to me if you judge them for something
[1:34:28] else they did if you judge them for what
[1:34:30] they did to you that's fine but please
[1:34:32] don't judge them for what they did to me
[1:34:34] I set them free that is pure true
[1:34:38] forgiveness and if you can't do that you
[1:34:41] have not come to forgiveness from the
[1:34:42] heart yet and don't feel horrible if
[1:34:44] you're not there it doesn't come easy
[1:34:47] friends sometimes we got to go back and
[1:34:48] say God I need your help I'm not able I
[1:34:51] can't get over I can't get free I'm not
[1:34:53] able to Bear the consequence of their
[1:34:55] action I still want them to
[1:34:59] pay if you still want them to pay even
[1:35:01] though you're not going to make them
[1:35:02] you're just trusting that God will do it
[1:35:05] we're not there
[1:35:06] yet because how did Jesus forgive us
[1:35:10] father forgive
[1:35:15] them
[1:35:18] Father I take all the consequences for
[1:35:21] their actions upon myself
[1:35:25] s forgive them they don't know what
[1:35:28] they're
[1:35:29] doing do you realize what a powerful
[1:35:32] statement that was that day on
[1:35:35] Calvary the question is are we going to
[1:35:38] be Christlike or
[1:35:41] not this comes down to
[1:35:44] reality I said this is powerful this is
[1:35:47] deep this is not trivial this is not
[1:35:49] surface this is not mental this is the
[1:35:51] depths of reality
[1:35:56] nobody gets off free I didn't get off
[1:35:59] free it was free to me but it cost
[1:36:02] Christ the offender that offended me he
[1:36:05] doesn't get off free because I'm paying
[1:36:06] the
[1:36:09] price somebody pays for
[1:36:13] forgiveness the question is are we
[1:36:15] willing to
[1:36:16] pay to forgive really pay to where it's
[1:36:21] all on me and I'm not asking for any any
[1:36:24] retribution from the offender and asking
[1:36:27] standing in the gap for them and asking
[1:36:29] God to let them go
[1:36:30] too that's real
[1:36:33] forgiveness turn with me to Acts chapter
[1:36:50] 7 acts 7:59
[1:36:59] and they stoned step calling upon God
[1:37:02] and saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit
[1:37:05] and he kneeled down and cried with a
[1:37:07] loud voice Lord lay not this sin to
[1:37:10] their charge and when he had said this
[1:37:13] he fell
[1:37:15] asleep this is
[1:37:19] forgiveness you know what he asked
[1:37:22] God God
[1:37:24] do not hold anybody here accountable for
[1:37:26] stoning me
[1:37:29] yeah who paid the price for their
[1:37:33] forgiveness Stephen was paying the price
[1:37:35] for their forgiveness because
[1:37:37] forgiveness is never
[1:37:39] free Stephen was willing to lay his life
[1:37:42] down for his brothers so that God would
[1:37:45] not judge them for stoning him and when
[1:37:47] did he forgive them when Stones were
[1:37:50] beating off of his skull in the midst of
[1:37:53] being stoned they were stoning him he
[1:37:55] was calling on God the Rocks were
[1:37:57] hitting him and he fell to his knees and
[1:37:59] upon his knees he said father lay not
[1:38:02] this sin to their charge what's he
[1:38:04] saying God I'm I forgive them you
[1:38:07] forgive them don't hold anyone who threw
[1:38:09] a rock accountable for hitting me with a
[1:38:11] rock and killing me and you know what I
[1:38:13] believe God honored it and they went
[1:38:14] free for that they may have done
[1:38:16] something later that brought their
[1:38:17] condemnation but he was standing in the
[1:38:19] Gap he was playing the part of Christ he
[1:38:21] was being like his father and was
[1:38:23] forgiving while he was paying the
[1:38:25] consequences for their
[1:38:27] actions that's genuine forgiveness and
[1:38:30] you know who was standing there watching
[1:38:32] over the coats while they're being
[1:38:33] stoned amen it was Saul who would later
[1:38:35] become the Apostle Paul what if he would
[1:38:37] said God don't let one of them get by
[1:38:39] with this judge them all what would have
[1:38:41] happened to Paul Paul was forgiven by
[1:38:47] Stephen you have no idea what
[1:38:49] forgiveness does for the other person
[1:38:51] amen realizing that we're not not just
[1:38:54] people born in this earth living life we
[1:38:55] are products of God we are children of
[1:38:58] God we're little Messiahs amen we're
[1:39:00] here on Earth representing Christ you
[1:39:02] know what happens if you hold a grudge
[1:39:03] and hold somebody accountable and never
[1:39:05] forgive them I would hate to think of
[1:39:07] what happens but somebody's Eternal
[1:39:08] destination might might might might hang
[1:39:11] on the balance of our attitude towards
[1:39:12] them in
[1:39:13] forgiveness do you remember when job
[1:39:15] went through his trial and job three
[1:39:17] friends they kept accusing him and
[1:39:18] accusing him and falsely accusing him
[1:39:20] amen at the end of that trial although
[1:39:22] job himself had made a mistake amen God
[1:39:25] come and deal with job and job repented
[1:39:27] but you know what God Said to those
[1:39:28] three friends he said do three friends
[1:39:30] go back and have job pray for you if job
[1:39:33] doesn't stand in the gap for you you're
[1:39:36] toast so what was job praying about what
[1:39:39] was the prayer over amen there could
[1:39:41] only be one thing God would you forgive
[1:39:43] them and let them go because if not they
[1:39:45] were doomed it was job who who was
[1:39:48] offended by their remarks who had to
[1:39:50] stand in the Gap God didn't even deal
[1:39:52] with them directly
[1:39:53] God said you offended
[1:39:55] job go back to job yeah and if job
[1:39:59] doesn't pray for you you're
[1:40:02] finished do you realize what the
[1:40:05] consequences of our unforgiveness could
[1:40:08] be because a coworker said something
[1:40:11] they shouldn't have said took something
[1:40:13] they shouldn't have taken got a
[1:40:14] promotion over us because of Lies they
[1:40:16] told and we hold bitterness towards
[1:40:18] them can you imagine what the
[1:40:21] consequences could be for some sons of
[1:40:23] God who refuse to
[1:40:27] forgive let us forgive all
[1:40:30] men let us forgive all men the same way
[1:40:33] we were forgiven God let them go it's
[1:40:36] okay I'll take it I'm not asking them to
[1:40:40] pay and I'm not asking you to make them
[1:40:41] pay I'm asking you to let them go free
[1:40:43] because of me for my sake I bear the
[1:40:47] consequences of their
[1:40:50] actions that's what job was doing when
[1:40:52] he was standing in the gap for his
[1:40:53] children offering
[1:40:58] sacrifice praise be to
[1:41:01] God brother B said why am I and why am I
[1:41:04] against organized religion he said if
[1:41:05] what is the purpose to the church the
[1:41:07] life that was in Christ isn't reflecting
[1:41:08] in you don't you stand still if you
[1:41:11] haven't got patience virtue all these
[1:41:12] things in Temperance and things and
[1:41:14] godliness and brotherly kindness and all
[1:41:16] these things that's required of you no
[1:41:17] matter what you've done no matter how
[1:41:19] much you shouted how many churches
[1:41:21] you've joined how many feathers you pin
[1:41:22] into your yourself don't do it wait till
[1:41:25] genuinely from your heart you can
[1:41:27] forgive till your in your heart you have
[1:41:30] brotherly kindness no matter if they're
[1:41:32] pulling handful of beard from one side
[1:41:34] you can turn the other cheek with
[1:41:36] sweetness see until those virtues no
[1:41:38] matter what they say to you say oh God
[1:41:41] help me help me God to where I can get
[1:41:44] to the place where in the offense I can
[1:41:46] forgive like Stephen did like Jesus did
[1:41:50] that I can get to the place where wow
[1:41:52] they're plucking handfuls of beer I can
[1:41:54] say father forgive them they don't know
[1:41:55] what they're
[1:41:56] doing that's what God's growing us to
[1:41:59] friends this is what adoption looks like
[1:42:01] adoption isn't just being able to call
[1:42:02] fire down adoption is coming into the
[1:42:04] place where you can conduct yourself the
[1:42:06] same way the father
[1:42:10] does again he
[1:42:12] says for if you love those that just who
[1:42:16] love you as we shook one another's hands
[1:42:18] as dearly beloved in the Lord that's
[1:42:19] good but can you also love the unlovable
[1:42:22] that's the thinking man's filter that's
[1:42:24] the spirit of Christ in you loving those
[1:42:26] who don't love you then you have the
[1:42:28] reward of God now but now if you do it
[1:42:31] as a duty you still haven't got the
[1:42:33] thinking man you're only up in the
[1:42:35] second cycle but it's from your heart
[1:42:37] you really love him then you're
[1:42:39] breathing through the thinking man's
[1:42:40] filter and it satisfies a holy man's
[1:42:43] taste that you know from your heart you
[1:42:45] forgive everybody everything no matter
[1:42:47] what takes
[1:42:49] place that's the Forgiveness that we're
[1:42:52] called to
[1:42:55] why I say it's not a light thing it's
[1:42:58] heavy
[1:43:01] amen Proverbs 18:14 I'm just going to
[1:43:03] read to you but Proverbs 18:14 says the
[1:43:05] spirit of man will sustain his infirmity
[1:43:08] but a wounded Spirit who can
[1:43:11] bear wounded spirit is what's caused all
[1:43:14] this trouble and off fence and a wound
[1:43:17] how are we going to get free from
[1:43:19] it there was a situation brother Ben
[1:43:23] found himself in we talked about it last
[1:43:25] time we
[1:43:26] preached but when he went through a
[1:43:29] series of deaths his father died his
[1:43:31] brother died his wife died and now he's
[1:43:35] standing by the little Crib in the
[1:43:37] basement of the hospital where his
[1:43:39] baby's dying and he goes to pray to God
[1:43:41] and like a black sheet comes down and
[1:43:44] that black sheet coming down begins to
[1:43:47] uh uh he said God like he wouldn't talk
[1:43:49] to me he said when he stopped talking to
[1:43:51] me Satan started
[1:43:53] and what did Satan start
[1:43:55] doing he started accusing God to the
[1:43:59] prophet he started saying you know he
[1:44:02] wouldn't have to speak the word just one
[1:44:04] glance and she'd be healed and of all
[1:44:06] the people you prayed for and you've
[1:44:07] served him and this is how he'll treat
[1:44:09] you right and look at what Satan was
[1:44:12] trying to do Satan was trying to take
[1:44:15] this wound that was being Afflicted to
[1:44:17] brother brandom at the loss of his wife
[1:44:18] his baby his father his brother and he
[1:44:21] was trying to get brother brandham
[1:44:23] offended at God right he was trying he
[1:44:27] was making accusations about God's love
[1:44:30] for him and God's care for him and God's
[1:44:33] righteousness and God's justice After
[1:44:35] all you've done staying up all night
[1:44:37] preaching going out on the street doing
[1:44:38] all of this and he'll treat you like
[1:44:41] that oh my goodness that slick devil how
[1:44:44] can he say a thing like that about God
[1:44:47] he's trying to take the wound amen
[1:44:49] that's being Afflicted upon brother
[1:44:50] brandham and he's trying to create an
[1:44:52] off towards
[1:44:54] god listen the reason I bring this up
[1:44:56] friends is because that's exactly what
[1:44:58] some of you are struggling with
[1:44:59] something happened in your life and you
[1:45:01] say how could God let this happen to me
[1:45:05] Hey listen that's the devil whispering
[1:45:06] in your ear how could God let this
[1:45:08] happen to me what do you mean how are
[1:45:10] you exempt from life like everybody else
[1:45:12] have life why is all of a sudden you're
[1:45:14] supposed to be in a bubble when all
[1:45:15] God's children have to go through life
[1:45:17] have to be afflicted have to grow have
[1:45:19] to do why what makes you think he's
[1:45:21] dealing with you wrongly
[1:45:23] you realize that's a that is a
[1:45:25] reflection against the character of God
[1:45:28] those false accusations are actually
[1:45:30] demeaning the very character of God as
[1:45:31] if he's not righteous as if he's not
[1:45:33] just as if he's not perfect as if he's
[1:45:35] treating you differently than somebody
[1:45:37] else and you're getting an unfair
[1:45:38] treatment amen that's the whisper of the
[1:45:40] devil and what the devil's trying to do
[1:45:42] is get you offended at God why did you
[1:45:44] take my baby why did you take my husband
[1:45:46] why did I lose that job why did this all
[1:45:48] fall apart why did you let this happen
[1:45:50] to me amen listen that is not not God
[1:45:53] that's the devil speaking through you
[1:45:55] stop talking like that right now say God
[1:45:58] why didn't you say my children why did
[1:45:59] you let him go to the world why did you
[1:46:01] do that's accusing the righteous holy
[1:46:03] God of doing wrong and it's all the
[1:46:06] devil trying to get you and I offended
[1:46:08] at God because if we get offended at God
[1:46:10] we do the same thing that happened right
[1:46:13] there we hold God in contempt of doing
[1:46:15] us wrong and we nurse a wound thinking
[1:46:17] God's
[1:46:20] guilty he could have stopped it well of
[1:46:23] course he could have stopped
[1:46:25] it he could have come on the scene he
[1:46:27] could have healed he could have showed
[1:46:28] up sooner he could have saved my baby's
[1:46:30] life he could have not let that car
[1:46:32] accident he could have five minutes
[1:46:33] earlier he could have five minutes later
[1:46:35] he could have he could have he could
[1:46:41] have some of the wounds in our heart
[1:46:43] aren't towards other
[1:46:44] men some of the wounds in our heart are
[1:46:46] towards
[1:46:49] God because the devil gave us a false
[1:46:51] Narrative of what happened
[1:46:53] like he was trying to give the prophet a
[1:46:55] false Narrative of what was happening
[1:46:58] God don't love you and he don't care for
[1:46:59] you like he should you served him and
[1:47:01] this is his reward to
[1:47:04] you he's done the same thing to some of
[1:47:09] you you can never grow spiritually being
[1:47:13] bitter towards
[1:47:16] God why did I have to be born in this
[1:47:18] house why was my mom like this why was
[1:47:20] my dad a drunkard why yeah why didn't I
[1:47:24] get the opportunity as another God why
[1:47:26] did you let them and not
[1:47:32] me sometimes we just have to be
[1:47:35] real honest really
[1:47:39] honest and if we've got that kind of
[1:47:41] offense towards God because of a false
[1:47:43] narrative from the devil we need to come
[1:47:45] back to the truth and say devil you're a
[1:47:47] liar for he's my father and he loves me
[1:47:50] and does everything perfect and
[1:47:51] everything is for my good and for the
[1:47:53] benefit and for the kingdom never did he
[1:47:55] allow anything to hurt me he did
[1:47:57] everything to mold me and make me and
[1:47:58] perfect me and when I am tried I shall
[1:48:01] come forth this gold because he's
[1:48:03] ordained it so from before the
[1:48:05] foundation of the world and Satan you're
[1:48:07] a liar brother Brandon went so far down
[1:48:09] that road until he got to the point
[1:48:11] where he said I almost agreed with him
[1:48:13] and I almost said if that's the way he
[1:48:15] does then I'll stop preaching that's
[1:48:17] what brother BM said he got to that
[1:48:19] point he says but then it went down to
[1:48:21] the soul and there was something there
[1:48:22] was eternal life down there and said
[1:48:24] Satan get thee behind me mean we need to
[1:48:27] go a little deeper outside of our
[1:48:29] emotional realm outside of our broken
[1:48:30] heart and go down to the Eternal and say
[1:48:32] Satan you're a liar god is perfect and
[1:48:35] everything that happened to me is for
[1:48:37] good for his good for my good and he's
[1:48:39] going to make me into a Son of God and
[1:48:42] there's not anything that's going to
[1:48:43] ruin my life everything's going to make
[1:48:45] me and you're going to find out
[1:48:50] someday you got to be real some of our
[1:48:52] offense has been towards God but we're
[1:48:54] afraid to admit
[1:48:57] it why didn't you preserve my marriage
[1:48:59] why didn't you let me get married why
[1:49:01] why do I have to stay this way and
[1:49:08] why listen don't dare think that I'm
[1:49:10] going to ask you to forgive God you
[1:49:11] ain't got to forgive God he didn't do
[1:49:12] anything wrong you got to fly higher and
[1:49:15] ask God to forgive you for thinking he
[1:49:17] did wrong you got to be the one to say
[1:49:20] god Set Me Free from this wrong thinking
[1:49:22] God I'm sorry I condemned you I'm sorry
[1:49:24] I I defamed your character I'm sorry I
[1:49:26] entertained thoughts like that God would
[1:49:28] you forgive me for that's not
[1:49:33] right
[1:49:36] amen that's the reality
[1:49:41] friends but now let's go
[1:49:44] back to our
[1:49:49] drawing now we've cut the guilty free
[1:49:53] they're no longer responsible to us and
[1:49:55] we're not responsible to
[1:49:57] them but we hold this wound in our
[1:50:04] heart I just read to you it said the
[1:50:06] spirit of a man will sustain his
[1:50:07] infirmity but a wounded Spirit who can
[1:50:10] bear when it's all said and done when
[1:50:12] forgiveness when true forgiveness is
[1:50:14] given and the guilty is set free the
[1:50:18] victim is still sitting here with a
[1:50:20] broken
[1:50:21] heart you're still sitting with a broken
[1:50:23] you may not have the bitterness anymore
[1:50:25] you may not have the contempt or the
[1:50:26] anger but you're still got the
[1:50:29] wounds the question is what am I going
[1:50:31] to do
[1:50:33] now well I've got good news for you we
[1:50:37] have a Healer with a bomb in
[1:50:41] Gilead in Luke chapter 4 turn with me to
[1:50:44] Luke chapter
[1:50:48] 4 Luke chapter 4 verse 18
[1:50:57] Luke
[1:51:01] 4:18 said the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:51:04] me because Heath anointed me to preach
[1:51:06] the gospel to the poor he sent me to
[1:51:09] heal the
[1:51:10] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:51:12] the captives and recovery of sight to
[1:51:14] the blind to set at Liberty them that
[1:51:17] are bruised to preach the acceptable
[1:51:20] year of the Lord
[1:51:23] what is part of Christ's Ministry is the
[1:51:25] son of man
[1:51:27] Ministry it's to heal the
[1:51:30] brokenhearted do you believe he still
[1:51:32] heals broken hearts
[1:51:35] yes he said Deliverance to the captives
[1:51:38] we've been captive for too long by all
[1:51:41] of these hurts and these
[1:51:43] bitterness and he's to set to set at
[1:51:47] Liberty them that are bruised that word
[1:51:49] bruised means crushed you know what he's
[1:51:51] here to do set us free from all these
[1:51:54] Old Wounds amen there is a balm in
[1:51:57] Gilead There Is A Healer that doesn't
[1:52:01] just heal our bodies but he heals our
[1:52:03] hearts he's here for physical and
[1:52:06] spiritual
[1:52:07] healing amen he can he can heal us he
[1:52:10] can deliver us he can set us
[1:52:13] free let's look at Psalms 34 together
[1:52:16] just want to finish with just a couple
[1:52:17] more scriptures
[1:52:23] Psalms
[1:52:27] 34 Psalms 34:1
[1:52:35] 17 Psalms
[1:52:37] 34:17 the righteous cry and the Lord
[1:52:39] heareth and
[1:52:44] deliverthat heart and saveth such that
[1:52:47] be of a contrite spirit many are the
[1:52:50] afflictions of the righteous but the
[1:52:51] Lord
[1:52:52] out of them
[1:52:55] all that little all word
[1:52:59] again he's near
[1:53:01] those that are of a broken heart he's
[1:53:04] nigh unto them and save as such as a
[1:53:07] contrite spirit is that still true
[1:53:12] today you know what our Lord can't
[1:53:16] do he can't take what we're holding on
[1:53:20] to
[1:53:23] if we're holding on to the hurt as
[1:53:26] evidence of guilt so that we're
[1:53:28] Justified and the contempt we feel he
[1:53:32] will never ever take that
[1:53:35] away never because he's a gentleman he
[1:53:37] won't prior hands apart and rip it out
[1:53:39] of our hands we're actually holding on
[1:53:41] to it because we need it to justify our
[1:53:43] feelings and our hurt and our desire to
[1:53:46] see wrong things made right God will
[1:53:49] never take it that's why the thing that
[1:53:52] you have have to do first is truly
[1:53:54] forgive from the heart and set the
[1:53:58] guilty free free completely free and you
[1:54:01] now now what you know what I don't need
[1:54:03] anymore I don't need any evidence
[1:54:05] anymore because I set them
[1:54:06] free there's no court case there's no
[1:54:09] trial there's no penalty there's no
[1:54:11] judgment there's nothing they are
[1:54:13] completely free I don't need to remember
[1:54:16] anything they did to me I don't need to
[1:54:18] catalog it I don't need to file it I
[1:54:20] don't need to store it I don't need
[1:54:21] evidence against the day that Calamity
[1:54:23] finally comes they are completely free I
[1:54:26] don't need it anymore all I need is to
[1:54:28] be free from what I'm holding on to and
[1:54:31] I'm willing to hold it so they can go
[1:54:32] free I'm holding this for their freedom
[1:54:35] but I'm asking my God God will you heal
[1:54:37] my broken heart will You Mend up the
[1:54:40] broken places you know what happened to
[1:54:41] me you know the effect and I set them
[1:54:43] free and if I have to live all my life
[1:54:45] this way I still want them to be free
[1:54:47] but I believe that you came to heal the
[1:54:50] brokenhearted and to set it Liberty
[1:54:52] those that are
[1:54:56] bruised I want to turn to one more
[1:54:58] scripture together I'm going to read two
[1:54:59] more but this let's turn to this one
[1:55:00] first Peter all the way back to First
[1:55:03] Peter I want you to think about
[1:55:06] this 1 Peter chapter
[1:55:19] 5 First Peter chapter 5
[1:55:23] verse
[1:55:24] seven casting all your care upon him for
[1:55:27] he carth for
[1:55:31] you he's not just going to take it if
[1:55:34] we're holding
[1:55:35] it if if we' still got a court case we
[1:55:39] still got judgment
[1:55:42] pending he's not going to take
[1:55:45] it but when the case is
[1:55:48] closed the innocent or the guilty is
[1:55:51] turned free
[1:55:52] dissolved of all guilt free to
[1:55:55] go now I don't need evidence anymore
[1:56:00] amen what I need is
[1:56:04] healing and he says cast all your cares
[1:56:07] upon Him for he carth for you that means
[1:56:11] if I give it to
[1:56:13] him he'll take it is that what the
[1:56:16] scripture is
[1:56:17] saying if I give it to him why haven't I
[1:56:20] given it to him before because I needed
[1:56:22] it for
[1:56:23] judgment you see why we struggle with
[1:56:26] things so long amen it's our own
[1:56:27] subconscious holding court case and
[1:56:29] holding guilty if we would just go and
[1:56:32] and forgive the way Jesus forgave us and
[1:56:34] set the captives free set the guilty
[1:56:36] free then all of a sudden I'm free now
[1:56:38] to cast upon him all my cares all my
[1:56:41] anxieties all my worri everything that's
[1:56:42] troubling me I can give it to him
[1:56:44] because he cares for me amen but I never
[1:56:47] let him have it because I still needed
[1:56:49] it I needed to nurse it I needed to
[1:56:51] rehearse it I needed to go over it with
[1:56:54] every new relationship I
[1:56:56] had but oh how wonderful it' be to be
[1:56:59] free not to need to rehearse it again
[1:57:01] and talk about it once more and and go
[1:57:03] over the catalog and remember the
[1:57:05] sequence of events and the orders that
[1:57:06] happened because I they're guilty oh I
[1:57:08] would love to just be free and forget
[1:57:10] about it there's things that happened to
[1:57:14] me that I had to go through this
[1:57:15] exercise with and listen friends
[1:57:17] sometimes I forget that it even happened
[1:57:19] or if I go back I still have a vague
[1:57:20] memory but there's no pain at attached
[1:57:22] to it anymore so when I go back there I
[1:57:24] said well something happened but the
[1:57:25] details Escape me you know what happened
[1:57:27] when I was still nursing the hurt for
[1:57:29] judgment I remembered every detail every
[1:57:32] infraction and the order it happened in
[1:57:35] right why because I was still
[1:57:39] judging but when there's real
[1:57:41] forgiveness and there's genuine healing
[1:57:44] and there's scriptural forgiveness the
[1:57:45] way Christ forgiv he puts our sins in
[1:57:48] the sea of his forgetfulness we can't be
[1:57:50] like God I wish I could forget
[1:57:51] everything but I'll tell you what
[1:57:52] happened when I didn't need to remember
[1:57:54] anymore there's a whole lot of bad
[1:57:56] details that just went out of my mind I
[1:57:58] remember something happened but I forgot
[1:58:00] some of the details sometimes my wife
[1:58:01] and I will be talking and she'll say do
[1:58:03] you remember when that and that happened
[1:58:05] and I say no I
[1:58:06] forgot I had forgot and she goes
[1:58:08] remember and I couldn't I can't pull it
[1:58:10] up then she'll give a couple more
[1:58:11] details I said oh I
[1:58:14] remember praise God that's Freedom
[1:58:16] friends that's genuine Freedom through
[1:58:19] forgiveness
[1:58:22] we think there's things in our life
[1:58:24] will'll never get over that's not the
[1:58:26] truth there may be things that molded us
[1:58:29] shaped us that God's using for something
[1:58:31] but there are things that you don't have
[1:58:33] to be bogged down by the rest of your
[1:58:35] life that are handicaps that hold you
[1:58:36] down you can be
[1:58:38] healed but you can't be healed until you
[1:58:43] forgive because if you don't forgive
[1:58:46] you'll not be
[1:58:47] forgiven why is it if we don't forgive
[1:58:50] we'll not be forgiven
[1:58:52] why is
[1:58:54] that because if we don't
[1:58:56] forgive then we're still holding on to
[1:58:59] somebody else's sin and won't let it go
[1:59:02] so we're still
[1:59:05] guilty but when we
[1:59:07] forgive we can be
[1:59:11] forgiven and you know what I'm just
[1:59:14] going to draw this
[1:59:24] there's a
[1:59:26] bomb in
[1:59:28] Gilead there's an oil of the Holy Ghost
[1:59:32] that God can pour out and heal our
[1:59:35] broken
[1:59:41] hearts and may
[1:59:44] God
[1:59:46] heal our broken
[1:59:50] heart you can say God heal me God heal
[1:59:53] me God take this away God take this
[1:59:54] anger God take this this God take this
[1:59:58] he can't take what you're still holding
[2:00:00] on to he can't take what is your
[2:00:03] evidence against your brother he can't
[2:00:05] take what you need to still condemn
[2:00:08] somebody else but what he can take is
[2:00:11] what you don't need anymore and what you
[2:00:13] can cast upon him he can take from
[2:00:17] us I want to read one scripture together
[2:00:20] and we'll close let's go to Second Corin
[2:00:23] Ians musicians if you can make your way
[2:00:25] up please brother Blake come on up
[2:00:28] second
[2:00:32] Corinthians chapter
[2:00:34] 2 2 Corinthians chapter
[2:00:44] 2 in second Corinthians 2 let's read
[2:00:47] from verse
[2:00:49] 5 but if any have caused grief he has
[2:00:52] not grieved me but in part that I may
[2:00:54] not overcharge you all sufficient to
[2:00:56] such a man is the punishment which was
[2:00:58] inflicted of many so that contrarywise
[2:01:00] you ought rather to forgive him than
[2:01:02] comfort him lest perhaps such a one
[2:01:04] should be swallowed up with over much
[2:01:06] sorrow wherefore I beseech you that you
[2:01:09] would confirm your love toward him for
[2:01:11] to this end also did I write that I
[2:01:13] might know the proof that you the proof
[2:01:16] of you whether you be obedient in all
[2:01:18] things to whom you forgive anything I
[2:01:21] forgive also also for if I forgave
[2:01:23] anything to whom I forgave it for your
[2:01:25] sakes forgave I it in the person of
[2:01:27] Christ lest Satan should get an
[2:01:30] advantage of us for you are not ignorant
[2:01:32] of his
[2:01:34] devices
[2:01:36] what you mean if I don't forgive Satan
[2:01:40] is going to take advantage of
[2:01:42] me
[2:01:44] absolutely it's going to bring a root of
[2:01:46] bitterness into your heart that'll
[2:01:48] canker and'll cause all kinds of
[2:01:50] division and problems and it'll hurt
[2:01:52] every other relationship in our lives
[2:01:55] and Paul says you forgive who you
[2:01:57] forgive I forgive whoever I forgive
[2:01:59] anything I forgive in the p as the
[2:02:01] person of Christ that Satan doesn't get
[2:02:04] advantage of us because we're not
[2:02:07] ignorant to his
[2:02:09] devices it must needs be that offense
[2:02:12] has
[2:02:13] come you know what you and I need to be
[2:02:17] offended amen let's just change the way
[2:02:21] we look at the world we must be offended
[2:02:25] why must I be offended because Christ
[2:02:27] has to be made manifest in Bride
[2:02:31] form what how am I going to display the
[2:02:34] Forgiveness that Christ gave unless I'm
[2:02:36] offended am how am I going to show
[2:02:39] brotherly kindness and love unless I'm
[2:02:40] offended offenses must needs come praise
[2:02:44] God when they come will they hurt yes
[2:02:47] will you get wounded yes can you forgive
[2:02:50] yes can you forgive from your heart yes
[2:02:53] with the help of God and if you forgive
[2:02:55] from your heart is there somebody that
[2:02:56] can heal your broken heart
[2:02:59] yes you know what when we're trying to
[2:03:02] look to the guilty party to heal our
[2:03:04] broken heart we're going to always be
[2:03:06] disappointed because that person many
[2:03:08] times can't take back what they did it's
[2:03:11] done what they said the way they acted
[2:03:14] it's done they can't take it back they
[2:03:16] can't make it right so we're holding on
[2:03:18] to this hurt always waiting for somebody
[2:03:20] to make it right make they they never
[2:03:22] can make it right they can never take it
[2:03:24] away they can never undo it so why don't
[2:03:27] we just cut them free and let them go
[2:03:30] and take this hurt to the one person who
[2:03:31] can actually take it
[2:03:33] away we're looking to the wrong place to
[2:03:37] get healing we're looking to the wrong
[2:03:38] place to get better we're looking to the
[2:03:40] wrong thing to come out of where we're
[2:03:42] at we need to we need to come back to
[2:03:44] forgiving the way Christ forgave us for
[2:03:46] setting people free for bearing the
[2:03:48] consequences for their actions and
[2:03:50] letting them go and then going to the
[2:03:52] one who's got the bomb of Gilead who
[2:03:53] promised to set at Liberty those were
[2:03:55] bruised and go to him and say God would
[2:03:57] you heal my broken heart I did what you
[2:04:00] asked me to do would you come and heal
[2:04:02] me Lord and I don't believe he'll tell
[2:04:05] you no but I believe he'll heal your
[2:04:09] heart and let's all stand
[2:04:13] together let's not be ignorant of his
[2:04:17] devices offenses must needs be praise
[2:04:22] God have you been offended lately
[2:04:26] perfect that's according to
[2:04:29] prophecy have you been hurt has somebody
[2:04:32] done you wrong wonderful now the words
[2:04:35] of Jesus are being fulfilled in your
[2:04:37] lives now the question is will the rest
[2:04:39] of the scriptures be made
[2:04:42] manifest and I believe the answer to
[2:04:44] that is
[2:04:45] yes Lord amen let's sing that song Blake
[2:04:49] he has forgiven me he
[2:04:52] has will he
[2:04:56] has
[2:04:58] forgiv
[2:05:00] me my sins are all washed from his
[2:05:08] me by the blood of the
[2:05:12] Lamb
[2:05:17] of

[2:05:23] for me sing it again
[2:05:26] he has
[2:05:32] for my sins are washed from his
[2:05:40] M by the blood of the Lamb
[2:05:48] of he

[2:06:03] me my sins are was from his
[2:06:11] meory by the blood of the
[2:06:15] Lamb of
[2:06:20] [Music]
[2:06:21] he has
[2:06:25] [Music]
[2:06:28] for amen let's all bow our heads
[2:06:32] together just want to ask
[2:06:35] you if you know that there's a wound in
[2:06:38] your
[2:06:39] heart that you've been holding on to
[2:06:42] because you've holding somebody in
[2:06:44] guilt you're holding them condemned for
[2:06:46] what they did to
[2:06:49] you I want to ask you if you'd like to
[2:06:51] let them go
[2:06:53] today if you would like to set them free
[2:06:55] if you'd like to cut the chains that
[2:06:57] bind your heart to
[2:07:00] them it's the only way that you can be
[2:07:02] free is if you first set them free
[2:07:05] amen I want to ask you too are you
[2:07:07] willing to pay the price are you still
[2:07:10] expecting somebody else to make it
[2:07:14] right are you willing today to let the
[2:07:17] guilty go the same way Jesus let you
[2:07:20] Goen are you willing to let them go
[2:07:23] before they ask are you willing to pay
[2:07:25] the price they can't pay are you willing
[2:07:28] to bear the consequences for their
[2:07:30] actions and let them go completely free
[2:07:32] not even judged by God that you're going
[2:07:34] to ask God to forgive them on behalf of
[2:07:37] you for your
[2:07:39] sake can you forgive from the heart can
[2:07:42] you ask God to help you let them go
[2:07:45] completely free can you
[2:07:47] see maybe they suffer
[2:07:50] too May maybe things haven't been so
[2:07:52] easy for them
[2:07:54] either can you have compassion even on
[2:07:56] the one who's hurt you even on the
[2:08:01] guilty if you want to let them free I
[2:08:03] believe God will come and pour out his
[2:08:05] spirit and help you from your heart to
[2:08:08] let them go free for that's what he's
[2:08:10] commanded in his word that's what his
[2:08:12] desire is for his children and I believe
[2:08:14] with all my heart in this atmosphere
[2:08:15] he'll help you today if you can just
[2:08:18] lift before him your hands and say God I
[2:08:20] want to set them free I don't want to
[2:08:22] hold them in contempt anymore I want to
[2:08:24] forgive the way you forgave me I I want
[2:08:27] them to go free like you made me go free
[2:08:30] and I don't hold them accountable and
[2:08:31] I'm not asking you to judge them I want
[2:08:33] you to let them go free
[2:08:36] too oh I believe that's what he wants
[2:08:38] from us that's adoption that's maturity
[2:08:41] that's the life of
[2:08:43] Christ can you touch that pain again in
[2:08:45] your heart can you go back to the place
[2:08:47] where you were wounded can you go back
[2:08:49] to the most hurtful event in your life
[2:08:50] and feel the pain the way Jesus felt it
[2:08:53] at Calvary with the piercings in his
[2:08:55] wrist with the piercings in his feet
[2:08:57] with the stripes on his back with the
[2:08:59] Thorns pressed into his brow with his
[2:09:01] eyes seeing the mocking and the
[2:09:03] scourging in the moment of
[2:09:05] pain he said father forgive them can you
[2:09:09] go back to the most painful incident in
[2:09:11] your life Can you feel it can it feel
[2:09:14] sharp and hurtful can it bring tears to
[2:09:16] your eyes and at that moment can you say
[2:09:19] father forgive them
[2:09:21] they don't know what they're doing to
[2:09:23] me can you let them go free can you set
[2:09:27] the captives free can you be like your
[2:09:29] father can you be a child of God
[2:09:32] displaying the character of
[2:09:34] God I believe he'll help you if you come
[2:09:37] with an honest heart and you desire
[2:09:40] maybe you heard things differently today
[2:09:42] like you never heard them before maybe
[2:09:43] your understanding of forgiveness is
[2:09:45] different than what it was I encourage
[2:09:47] you to act upon it act upon it
[2:09:50] immediately that's God allow you to
[2:09:52] forgive from your heart and may God take
[2:09:55] all root of bitterness out of your heart
[2:09:57] and pour the bomb of Gilead in and heal
[2:09:59] your broken wounded spirit and may you
[2:10:02] go free may your relationships be better
[2:10:05] may your outlook be better May the
[2:10:06] freedom in your heart Bring such joy and
[2:10:08] ever vesence may it flow Out and Touch
[2:10:10] everybody's life may you be free maybe
[2:10:13] some of you for the first times in your
[2:10:15] lies may you go completely
[2:10:17] free through forgiveness
[2:10:21] Lord Jesus you see the hearts you know
[2:10:23] the hands God you know what's below the
[2:10:25] hands you know the needs you know what
[2:10:28] we've suffered from we know you know how
[2:10:30] we've heard you saw it you were aware
[2:10:33] you knew but Lord we know that offenses
[2:10:36] must come that the worst of the worst
[2:10:39] still serve a purpose
[2:10:41] Lord God I pray that you would help us
[2:10:43] to flesh out this word that these
[2:10:46] scriptures wouldn't just be something we
[2:10:47] read but it would be our life that we
[2:10:50] could take your place on this Earth and
[2:10:51] we can forgive those who've offended
[2:10:54] us God I pray you'd help your children
[2:10:56] now that you would by your spirit may
[2:10:59] you move in the hearts of your children
[2:11:01] may they be able to turn loose of things
[2:11:03] they've never turned loose of all their
[2:11:05] lives may they go free from things that
[2:11:07] they never thought they could be free
[2:11:09] from God I pray that you would help them
[2:11:11] now by the by the spirit Lord by the
[2:11:14] spirit pouring out in this place May the
[2:11:16] anointing strike their heart and may
[2:11:18] they for the first time be able to let
[2:11:20] somebody go
[2:11:22] then God I ask that you would sweep back
[2:11:24] through with your spirit and that you
[2:11:26] would heal every broken Wounded
[2:11:29] Heart that we might go forward Lord
[2:11:32] differently than we've walked in the
[2:11:34] past that we might Lord be free and
[2:11:37] whole able Lord to live the life you've
[2:11:40] called us to
[2:11:41] live oh we love you we thank you God for
[2:11:44] your word it's so rich it's so powerful
[2:11:47] it's so true we thank you for your
[2:11:49] spirit that comes to make the word live
[2:11:51] now would you come and make it live in
[2:11:53] US Lord that it might be more than a
[2:11:56] sermon and more than a teaching and more
[2:11:58] than a visual but may it become a
[2:12:00] reality in My Heart Lord that I've
[2:12:02] experienced this kind of forgiveness and
[2:12:04] I've given this kind of
[2:12:06] forgiveness and may we experience your
[2:12:09] healing
[2:12:10] touch as you suck the poison of wounds
[2:12:13] and bitterness out of our heart may you
[2:12:15] draw the Venom of the enemy out he meant
[2:12:18] it for evil but you meant it for good
[2:12:21] may you pour the bomb of Gilead in and
[2:12:23] heal everyone Lord I pray bless us and
[2:12:27] help us as we walk out of here may we
[2:12:28] live differently from this day forward
[2:12:31] may we never view these things the same
[2:12:33] again help us to forgive every
[2:12:37] man that you might forgive us also we
[2:12:41] need your forgiveness We Need Your Love
