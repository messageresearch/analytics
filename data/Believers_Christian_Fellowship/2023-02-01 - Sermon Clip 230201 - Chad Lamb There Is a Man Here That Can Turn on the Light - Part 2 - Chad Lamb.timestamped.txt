[0:00] the life will come up then the little
[0:02] stronger a little stronger March April
[0:03] May June July she's in the Harvest and
[0:05] you see the same sun shining today in
[0:08] January December that's up there bathing
[0:10] the snow and melting it down on the
[0:12] grain bringing it water it's the same
[0:14] Sun but what the wheat could not live in
[0:16] that same sunlight in June so brother
[0:19] Benham is showing us through the church
[0:20] ages it's been the word all along
[0:24] it's been the light of the manifested
[0:26] word all along it was the light it was
[0:29] the light from the first age to the
[0:30] seventh age it's the same line just like
[0:33] it's the same sunlight in January it's
[0:35] the same sunlight in June but what the
[0:37] difference is it's intensifying in its
[0:40] strength as the seed is maturing
[0:43] and so now the the seed that needs to
[0:46] live in a hot June July August light to
[0:50] come to full rapturing maturity amen
[0:52] that plant will not survive in that
[0:55] stage in January it can't live it'll die
[0:58] so that's why if we come to the very end
[1:00] of time when East has met West again
[1:02] when the gospels went through three
[1:03] pulls it's come to the West it can't
[1:06] live in the light of a previous age
[1:07] it'll die it has to have the full power
[1:10] of the final light to bring it to full
[1:13] rapturing maturity
[1:15] that's why even today we can never live
[1:18] in the past
[1:19] we can't live in one we can't just live
[1:22] in the first and second pool brother
[1:23] benham's Ministry but the third pool
[1:25] amen brought Christ to us Amen in brine
[1:28] form and we can't even live on our
[1:30] experience from yesterday we have to
[1:32] have fresh sunlight today
[1:35] we have to walk in the light as Christ
[1:37] is unfolding himself in US
[1:40] it can't be just what happened 50 years
[1:42] ago it's got to be what's happening
[1:44] today
[1:46] we can never stop staying in the present
[1:49] tense truth and staying in the sun
[1:50] there's no time for us to stop and say
[1:52] wasn't that a beautiful light that shone
[1:56] it's got to be a beautiful light that's
[1:58] shining now
[1:59] to keep bringing us into full full
[2:03] maturity into the full light
