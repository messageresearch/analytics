[6:24] All our praise is due.
[6:28] I stand in awe
[6:32] of you
[6:35] as brother Chad comes.
[6:37] I worship
[6:39] you
[6:41] almighty
[6:43] God
[6:46] for there is none like you.
[6:53] Oh I worship
[6:55] you.
[6:57] Oh prince
[6:59] of peace,
[7:02] that is what I want to do.
[7:09] I'll give

[7:23] Oh, I worship

[7:49] There is none like you.
[7:55] Oh, I worship

[8:25] and I worship
[8:28] you
[8:30] almighty
[8:32] God.
[8:35] There is none like you.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. Let's
[8:45] bow our heads together.
[8:47] Oh, Father, we love you, Lord Jesus.
[8:51] We're so grateful, Lord, to be standing
[8:53] here again. For God, we believe that by
[8:56] your grace, you've gathered us once more
[8:58] because you desire to speak to us. And
[9:01] God, you've opened your word in this
[9:02] hour and you're constantly, Lord,
[9:05] bringing forth revelation of yourself
[9:07] and unfolding, Lord, that we might see
[9:09] you, God. And I pray, God, you give us
[9:12] eyes to see and ears to hear all that
[9:14] you want to share with us this morning.
[9:17] And may you be glorified, Lord. May you
[9:19] be the great one amongst us this
[9:21] morning, God, for we love to serve you.
[9:24] We desire to see you. We long to worship
[9:27] you and praise your name. And God, we
[9:30] just appreciate the privilege of
[9:31] gathering like this and we love you so
[9:33] much. We ask God now that as we yield
[9:36] ourselves to your hand that you would
[9:37] come and take this vessel completely
[9:40] under your control, Lord, and may you
[9:42] speak your words of eternal life. And
[9:44] may that word drop into our souls, Lord.
[9:46] And may it produce all that you intend
[9:48] for it to produce. For your word that
[9:51] goes out from you will not return void,
[9:53] but it will accomplish what you sent it
[9:55] forth to accomplish. and may it
[9:58] accomplish a work in each one of us. We
[10:00] pray. We love you. We ask you would
[10:02] bless us, Lord, as we look into your
[10:04] word, God. May you just break it to us
[10:07] yourself. In Jesus Christ's name we
[10:09] pray. Amen.
[10:12] Amen. God bless you all this morning.
[10:15] Certainly good to see you here. Amen.
[10:18] And before we turn on our Bibles, I just
[10:19] want to remind you that uh this is
[10:21] Christmas week. So, I want to say merry
[10:23] Christmas. God bless you. We hope that
[10:25] you have a wonderful week with your
[10:26] family. And instead of the Wednesday
[10:28] midweek service this week, we have it on
[10:29] Tuesday. So, I don't want anybody to
[10:31] forget that. I've already forgot.
[10:33] Somebody asked me last week, "What are
[10:34] your plans Tuesday?" I said, "I'm free
[10:36] Tuesday. I have no plans." I said,
[10:38] "Well, wait a minute. No, we got
[10:39] service. I'll be preaching." Amen. Amen.
[10:41] So, we'll see you here. Those who are
[10:43] able to make it on Tuesday, those who
[10:44] are not able, we know that some will be
[10:46] traveling. They have obligations. We're
[10:48] going to say, "God bless you. May you
[10:49] have a wonderful Christmas time." Amen.
[10:52] And also, we've got several visitors
[10:53] today. And I just saw Matthew. God bless
[10:55] you, brother Matthew. It's good to have
[10:56] you back. Amen. I'm glad you come back
[10:58] for a visit. Uh, Amen. Also, we have a
[11:02] brother Simon and sister Kesa from uh
[11:05] Kamita from Pennsylvania, but they're
[11:06] originally from Poland. So, this is
[11:08] brother Nathaniel Kamita's cousin. Amen.
[11:11] Who's come over from Poland to visit
[11:12] him. So, he's brought a lot of visitors
[11:14] our way. God bless you, brother. It's
[11:15] been wonderful. Amen. And brother
[11:18] Simon's wife is actually a daughter to a
[11:20] good friend of mine in Poland. Brother
[11:22] Robert Fischer who's a pastor there and
[11:24] we preached at his church. So it is a
[11:26] small world. Amen. So God bless you.
[11:28] It's good to have you here as well. And
[11:30] then brother Jeremy Sanders told me
[11:32] there's a brother JD visiting from
[11:33] Milwaukee. So and any other visitors, we
[11:36] want you to feel very welcome and at
[11:37] home and we're glad to have you here
[11:39] with us this morning. Amen. While we're
[11:42] standing, let's turn to the book of
[11:44] Matthewap 11. And as you turn to Matthew
[11:47] 11, I I want to tell you about a present
[11:49] I got Friday night. Amen. I got a little
[11:51] gift. I got a t-shirt.
[11:56] Amen. So, you can already guess what's
[11:58] on the t-shirt. Amen. Olivia Wholesapple
[12:01] made a t-shirt for me and the whole
[12:03] sapple clan brought it by. And the
[12:05] t-shirt says, "I am Altos Genos, chosen
[12:09] generation." So, praise the Lord. I told
[12:12] her, I said, "You better make a bunch of
[12:13] them. Those could be a hot commodity.
[12:16] So, I'm going to wear it someday. But it
[12:18] was nice of them and I I didn't expect
[12:20] anybody to actually make a t-shirt. I'm
[12:22] going have to be careful what I say.
[12:24] Amen. But it was nice and we certainly
[12:26] appreciated it. And it's still good.
[12:29] Amen. It's still a good idea. Electto
[12:31] Genos. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[12:34] Let's look here at Matthewap 11 verse
[12:37] 25.
[12:44] At that time Jesus answered and said,"I
[12:47] thank thee, oh Father, Lord of heaven
[12:49] and earth, because thou has hid these
[12:51] things from the wise and prudent, and
[12:53] has revealed them unto babes. Even so,
[12:56] Father, for so it seemed good in thy
[12:58] sight." Amen. God bless you as you have
[13:01] your seats. Amen. if we could pull up
[13:04] the PowerPoint. Uh, I'd like to preach
[13:06] this morning on the keys of Revelation
[13:08] and just take a look at this subject.
[13:11] But I am so glad that it seemed good in
[13:15] the sight of the father to reveal it to
[13:17] babes.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:19] &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad that you didn't have to
[13:21] be wise and prudent
[13:23] &gt;&gt; to catch the revel catch the revelation.
[13:25] Amen. Because I might have missed it. I
[13:27] might not have been able to meet the
[13:28] requirements. But there was only one
[13:30] requirement for catching the revelation.
[13:32] And that one requirement is to be a
[13:34] babe.
[13:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[13:35] &gt;&gt; And what kind of a babe? Amen. To be a
[13:38] babe means to be one of God's children.
[13:41] &gt;&gt; And if you're one of God's children,
[13:43] Amen. He's hid it from the wise and
[13:44] pruned. But he has revealed it unto
[13:48] babes.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so thankful to be one of those
[13:51] babes. Amen.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; To be by election to be part of God's
[13:55] family. Amen. And I'm glad it seemed
[13:57] good in his sight.
[13:59] This word in here that is uh revealed
[14:04] that revealed them unto babes. This word
[14:06] revealed is apocalyptto.
[14:09] It's used 26 times in the New Testament
[14:11] as reveal. Uh it means to uncover, to
[14:16] lay open what has been veiled or covered
[14:18] up. To disclose or to make bare, to make
[14:22] known, to make manifest, to close
[14:25] disclose what before was unknown. Amen.
[14:29] So when God brings a a revelation, amen,
[14:32] it's an unveiling of that which was
[14:34] covered up. Amen. It's a disclosing of
[14:37] something that's been hidden. And God
[14:39] can bring revelation to the individual.
[14:42] And to the in it always comes to the
[14:43] individual, but to the individual, he
[14:46] uncovers that part that we haven't seen
[14:48] before.
[14:49] &gt;&gt; But then there's always times of great
[14:51] revelation where God comes and uncovers
[14:54] what has never been seen before.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God has done that down through
[14:59] the ages. And each age has had an
[15:01] uncovering, has had an an has had an
[15:04] apocalyptto. Amen. Where God would
[15:07] unveil more of his mystery, more of
[15:09] himself. And the prophets themselves
[15:11] were a greater unveiling all the time.
[15:13] And every church age had another
[15:15] unveiling of his word. And and all down
[15:17] through time, God has been unveiling
[15:20] himself. And he's been revealing
[15:22] himself. And it's always been revealed
[15:24] to a special group of people who are the
[15:26] babes,
[15:27] &gt;&gt; the children of God who's been catching
[15:29] the revelation. And so there's great
[15:31] times of of revelation where God unveils
[15:34] what no one has ever seen before. Jesus
[15:37] said, "Many wise men and righteous men
[15:39] and prophets long to see your day. Long
[15:42] to see the day you see, but they didn't
[15:43] get to see it because it was still under
[15:45] the veil of God's mind and hadn't been
[15:48] unveiled yet."
[15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so those are great times of
[15:52] unveiling where God unveils what was
[15:54] never what had never seen light, what
[15:56] had never been uh opened before. Amen.
[15:58] So that's the general unveiling. But
[16:01] then we have our own personal unveiling
[16:03] where God takes that mystery that's now
[16:05] unveiled in every age and unveils it to
[16:08] us personally.
[16:09] &gt;&gt; So we have to have our own experience of
[16:12] a revelation. Amen. Not just the
[16:14] generational revelation, not just the
[16:16] dispensational revelation, but the
[16:18] dispensational revelation must become a
[16:21] personal revelation.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that is also the work of God.
[16:25] When we look at this scripture, he says,
[16:28] it says, "Thou has hid these things from
[16:30] the wise and the prudent."
[16:33] &gt;&gt; That means God hid them.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; He hid them.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; And hast revealed them unto babes. That
[16:40] means he revealed them. Yeah.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; So, who who controls the hiding and the
[16:44] revealing? It's God.
[16:47] &gt;&gt; And and he does it according to his
[16:49] election, according to his predestinated
[16:51] plan. And it seemed good in his sight to
[16:54] do it this way. And I'm glad he did it
[16:57] this way because if he did it based on
[16:59] intellect, if he did it on understanding
[17:01] or ability to study, Amen. I would have
[17:04] missed it. But he did it in a way that I
[17:06] couldn't miss it because he revealed it
[17:08] to the babes.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so thankful. God is so good.
[17:14] Let's go to Matthew 16 together.
[17:24] I mean, everybody who's been involved in
[17:25] the message in any time has started
[17:28] here, amen, with the foundation of the
[17:30] church. But we're going to come here in
[17:32] this service and look at this again.
[17:34] Matthew 16:E 13.
[17:37] When Jesus came into the coast of
[17:39] Cesaria Philippi, he asked his
[17:41] disciples, saying, "Whom do men say that
[17:43] I, the son of man, am?" And they
[17:45] said,"Some say that thou art John the
[17:47] Baptist, some Elias, and others Jeremiah
[17:49] or one of the prophets?" He saith unto
[17:52] them, "But whom say ye that I am?" Now
[17:55] listen, I've said this a dozen or more
[17:57] times, and I'll probably say it maybe a
[17:58] hundred more if God gives me breath, but
[18:00] this is to me one of the most critical
[18:02] questions in all the Bible.
[18:04] That's right.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; They were talking about what they had
[18:07] been hearing.
[18:08] &gt;&gt; They the talk the murmur amongst the
[18:11] crowd was some are saying that you're,
[18:13] you know, John the Baptist reincarnated
[18:15] or you're Jeremas or or you're one of
[18:17] the Elias or one of the prophets. But
[18:19] Jesus didn't want to hear what they
[18:21] heard by hearsay. He wanted to know who
[18:23] do you say that I am? What is your
[18:25] revelation? What do you think about it?
[18:27] Because that's what matters to us. Amen.
[18:29] It's got to be an individual personal
[18:31] revelation. Amen.
[18:32] &gt;&gt; And he says, "But whom say ye that I
[18:35] am?" And Simon Peter answered and said,
[18:37] "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the
[18:39] living God." Amen. Peter had heard what
[18:42] everybody else had heard. He had heard
[18:44] all the murmurings and the rumorings and
[18:46] maybe it's this and maybe it's that and
[18:48] and maybe he's this and that. Amen. But
[18:50] all the sudden under inspiration when
[18:52] God brought the question home and said,
[18:54] Jesus said, "Who do you say that I am?"
[18:56] Peter instantly by inspiration of the
[18:59] spirit he said, "Thou art Christ, the
[19:01] son of the living God." All of a sudden,
[19:03] something got put together. Amen. Some
[19:05] scripture came alive. Some reality
[19:07] struck Peter. And Peter didn't say, "I
[19:10] think or maybe or I'm presuming or I
[19:12] heard somebody else said." He just said
[19:14] emphatically, "Thou art Christ, the son
[19:16] of the living God."
[19:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. This isn't something that's taught
[19:20] to you. This is not something that you
[19:22] picked up from hearsay because he could
[19:24] have never made the statement the way he
[19:25] made the statement because he knew there
[19:27] was some debate. There was some
[19:29] murmuring. There was some discussion on
[19:31] who Jesus Christ was. And he had heard
[19:33] everything everybody else heard. And
[19:34] Jesus said, "Whom say whom say men that
[19:37] I am?" And and they're talking about
[19:38] what the talk is on the town, what the
[19:40] word is on the street. Amen. And he
[19:42] heard it all. Amen. But when God put the
[19:45] question, who do you say that I am? He
[19:47] didn't wait for the other disciples to
[19:49] answer. He didn't get the general
[19:50] consensus of the popular vote or what
[19:52] all the inner circles thought. He had
[19:54] something strike his heart and he knew
[19:56] beyond a shadow of a doubt, thou art
[19:58] Christ, the son of the living God.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; That's the power of revelation from the
[20:03] father to obey.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have to have a intellectual
[20:08] discussion and he doesn't have to go
[20:10] around the horn and he doesn't have to
[20:12] take a vote.
[20:14] Amen.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; He just says by revelation, "Thou art
[20:18] Christ, the son of the living God." And
[20:21] Jesus answered and said unto him,
[20:22] "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah, for
[20:25] flesh and blood hath not revealed it to
[20:27] thee, but my father which is in heaven."
[20:30] That's why he could say it the way he
[20:32] said it.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:36] And I say unto thee, that thou art
[20:38] Peter, and upon this rock I will build
[20:40] my church, and the gates of hell shall
[20:43] not prevail against it. And I will give
[20:45] unto thee the keys of the kingdom of
[20:48] heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt bind
[20:51] on earth shall be bound in heaven, and
[20:53] whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[20:55] shall be loosed in heaven. So when when
[20:59] Jesus hears Simon make this declaration,
[21:03] he knew Simon didn't get that out of his
[21:07] own study.
[21:09] &gt;&gt; He didn't come to that on his own. He
[21:11] didn't get that by the word on the
[21:13] street or the dialogue with the
[21:14] disciples. He He got that from the
[21:17] father.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he said, "Flesh and blood
[21:20] hath not revealed it unto thee, unveiled
[21:23] it, opened it unto thee, but my father
[21:26] which is in heaven." And I say that thou
[21:29] art Peter and upon this rock and brother
[21:31] Ben's very careful to tell us that that
[21:33] rock is the rock of spiritual revelation
[21:36] of the word.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; He was revealed to him the word for his
[21:41] day, who Christ was. and upon this rock
[21:44] I will build my church and the gates of
[21:47] hell shall not prevail against it. That
[21:50] means this foundation for our faith is a
[21:53] foundational understanding of who Christ
[21:55] is, who the word is in our day. Amen.
[21:58] And that understanding puts the church
[22:00] on a foundation that she cannot be moved
[22:03] in the gates of hell though they rage
[22:05] against her will never prevail over
[22:08] revelation.
[22:10] &gt;&gt; Never. It can prevail over study. It can
[22:13] prevail over intellectualism. It can
[22:15] prevail over theology. Amen. But the
[22:18] gates of hell cannot prevail over a
[22:20] church that's founded on the revelation
[22:22] of Jesus Christ.
[22:25] &gt;&gt; And then he told Peter, "And I will give
[22:27] unto thee the keys of the kingdom."
[22:30] This is an amazing statement. "I will
[22:32] give unto thee the keys of the kingdom
[22:34] of heaven, and whosoever and whatsoever
[22:37] thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
[22:39] in heaven. and whatsoever thou shalt
[22:40] loose on earth shall be loosed in
[22:42] heaven. To me, this is an amazing
[22:45] statement that he takes Peter and when
[22:47] we know Peter's background and we
[22:48] understand who Peter is, Peter is an
[22:52] illiterate, uneducated fisherman.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; Are we on the same page?
[22:58] &gt;&gt; He's a nobody from nowhere. And I hate
[23:00] to say it that way because we love
[23:01] Peter, but Peter would be just a common
[23:04] man
[23:05] &gt;&gt; who we call a common labor in our day.
[23:07] Amen. and and he didn't have anything
[23:09] special about him. No education, no
[23:11] training, no particularly good
[23:13] understanding or intellect or wisdom.
[23:15] Wasn't able to sign his name. Brother
[23:16] Venom said wasn't able to read.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; But God says, "I'm going to give you the
[23:22] keys to the kingdom of heaven."
[23:27] &gt;&gt; I mean, this isn't the keys to your new
[23:28] car, friends. This is the keys to the
[23:31] kingdom of heaven.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; And who is he entrusting the keys to?
[23:35] He's giving them to the uneducated,
[23:38] illiterate fisherman.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[23:40] &gt;&gt; Who happens to have a bit of a hot
[23:42] temper and goes off halfcocked most of
[23:44] the time.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; Who's going to need some correction even
[23:47] after this and he's going to need to
[23:49] he's going to need a new birth
[23:50] experience. He's going to need to be
[23:51] reigned in a bit. Amen. But but God,
[23:54] Amen. at this statement, at this
[23:56] revelation from the father. Amen. He was
[23:59] able to say, "I will give you the keys
[24:02] to the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever
[24:05] thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
[24:07] in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt
[24:09] loose on earth shall be loosed in
[24:11] heaven." And all of a sudden, there was
[24:12] a tremendous power placed in the hands
[24:15] of Peter, and a tremendous
[24:16] responsibility placed into his hands.
[24:19] Amen. And Peter, listen, Peter half the
[24:22] time doesn't have a clue what's going on
[24:23] or what he should be doing. And many
[24:25] times he's acting the wrong way and
[24:27] taking the wrong decision and coming to
[24:29] the wrong conclusions.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; So God didn't entrust this to a a man
[24:34] with inherent wisdom.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; He didn't give it to the man with the
[24:40] mildest temperament.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; The one who always makes the best
[24:45] decisions.
[24:46] He didn't even go to the ones who most
[24:48] mo most political cuz he surely wasn't
[24:51] although he was a little political when
[24:53] they were trying to find out who was
[24:54] going to be the greatest and he was in
[24:55] that debate too.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; Right.
[24:59] &gt;&gt; He he didn't give these keys and this
[25:01] responsibility of loosing and binding
[25:03] the power to loose and bind. He didn't
[25:05] give it to a man that was eloquent
[25:06] because Peter was not. He didn't give it
[25:08] to a man that was educated because Peter
[25:10] was not. He didn't give it to one who
[25:12] had life figured out because Peter did
[25:14] not.
[25:16] He gave the keys to one who could get a
[25:17] revelation from the father.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; And Peter was the first one to get this
[25:23] revelation of all the disciples. And
[25:25] when he declared it, Jesus says, "You're
[25:27] the one who's going to get the keys."
[25:30] &gt;&gt; Look at what the prophet says here.
[25:32] Says, he said, "Go baptize in the name
[25:35] of father, son, and holy ghost." So it
[25:37] could be revealed because Jesus knowed
[25:39] that Peter had the gift of revelations.
[25:42] He knowed because it had already been
[25:44] revealed to him by the spirit above. And
[25:46] when God sees that a man can receive
[25:48] revelations from above, he can trust
[25:51] that man and do something with him. When
[25:53] it's revealed to him, because he said,
[25:55] "No man can reveal this but his father."
[25:57] God is the only one who can reveal it.
[25:59] And he knew Peter was in contact with
[26:02] the spirit.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; God could trust. Amen. God, when God
[26:05] sees that man can receive revelation
[26:08] from above, he can trust that man to do
[26:10] something with him. God. Listen, God is
[26:12] not looking for our ability and our
[26:14] education and our good conduct and all
[26:16] of these things. God's not looking for
[26:18] the mildest temperament and the most
[26:20] persuasive speaker and the nicest PER
[26:23] THAT'S NOT WHAT GOD'S AFTER. AMEN.
[26:25] BECAUSE THERE'S PILES of those in the
[26:26] world. The grabag of life has put
[26:28] genetic uh ingredients together. Amen.
[26:31] And then you get more combinations than
[26:33] Skittles had and more than BaskinRobins.
[26:35] Amen. You get all kinds. And you get
[26:36] some that are super wise and
[26:38] intellectual and smooth. Amen. They can
[26:41] they can seem to put things together,
[26:42] but that's not what he's looking for.
[26:44] He's not looking for what genetics can
[26:46] put together. He's looking for that one
[26:48] that can receive a spiritual revelation
[26:50] from the father. And that's the one he
[26:52] can trust.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; THOUGH HE'S HOTTEMPERED, THOUGH HE
[26:56] SPOUTS off at the mouth, though he makes
[26:57] mistakes, though he's going to have to
[26:59] be corrected. Amen. THAT THAT DOESN'T
[27:01] MATTER TO GOD. GOD CAN FIX ALL OF THAT.
[27:04] AMEN. HIS blood is enough. The atonement
[27:05] was good enough. Amen. God can bring
[27:07] correction and education and training to
[27:10] his child. He has A ROD OF CORRECTION.
[27:12] He can fix that. But there's one thing
[27:14] he can't fix AND HE CAN'T FIX somebody
[27:16] that's born without a receiver for
[27:18] revelation.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; That's predestinated that was determined
[27:23] before the foundation of the world.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; So who's he looking to work with? The
[27:29] one that can receive revelation from the
[27:31] father.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; And God can trust a man like that.
[27:37] Brother Brandham says, "For Peter was
[27:39] given the key to the kingdom, saying,
[27:40] "Whatever you bind on earth, I'll bind
[27:42] it in heaven." And what does a key do?
[27:44] It unlocks something, the mystery.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; It unlocks something, the mystery. So
[27:51] Peter was going to unlock a mystery.
[27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; So opening the uh the key to heaven,
[27:59] Amen, was going to open a mystery. And
[28:02] this same key that would open a mystery.
[28:04] So in order to open the door to heaven,
[28:06] the kingdom of heaven is opened by a re
[28:09] revelation of a mystery.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; And then there's also power within that
[28:16] unlocking
[28:18] to loose or to bind.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; They go together.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever thou shalt loose shall be
[28:24] loosed in heaven. That whatsoever th
[28:25] bind on earth shall be bound in heaven.
[28:28] So it all goes together.
[28:30] In Matthew 28, he says, "And Jesus came
[28:32] and spake unto them, saying, All power
[28:35] is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
[28:38] Go ye therefore and teach all nations,
[28:40] baptizing them in the name of the Father
[28:42] and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
[28:45] Teaching them to observe all things
[28:47] whatsoever I've commanded you. And lo,
[28:49] I'm with you all we, even to the end of
[28:52] the world. Amen."
[28:54] And so God here as Jesus Christ when
[28:57] he's getting ready to leave, he's
[28:59] already been crucified. He's already
[29:01] resurrected. He's giving final
[29:03] instructions. And he tells them to go
[29:05] therefore and teach all nations,
[29:07] baptizing them in the name of the Father
[29:09] and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
[29:12] And this statement is intentional by by
[29:16] Christ. Amen. It's intentionally worded
[29:19] the way it's worded.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. for a reason.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; Because you know when I first came to
[29:26] the message and I was believing water
[29:27] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[29:29] Christ and was baptized. Amen. I
[29:31] believed it. I had a revelation. I knew
[29:33] it was true. And I came back to the
[29:35] scripture over and over and I said, "If
[29:37] Jesus would have just said it
[29:39] &gt;&gt; different, I could show all my friends.
[29:42] I could take it back TO MY FORMER
[29:44] PASTOR. I COULD SHOW THEM ALL of these
[29:46] things." But he intentionally said it
[29:48] the way he said it for a reason. Amen.
[29:51] Because revelation is only for the
[29:53] babes.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; Right. And so he it he it he didn't want
[29:59] it to be intellectual. Repeat after me
[30:02] Christianity. God never wanted a repeat
[30:05] after me prayer. Christianity. Say what
[30:08] I say and say you believe what I say and
[30:10] if you say what I say and claim to
[30:12] believe what I say, you're saved. He
[30:13] never wanted that. That's nowhere in the
[30:15] scriptures. That's not salvation.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. is based on revelation, divine
[30:21] revelation from the father. So he
[30:23] intentionally says it this way. And you
[30:26] could say, well, he made it difficult. I
[30:28] think he made it easy.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; It depends on which end you land whether
[30:33] you receive the revelation or don't. If
[30:35] you receive the revelation, it's easy. I
[30:37] know there's only name is singular, not
[30:39] plural. There's only one name that
[30:41] encompasses the father and the son and
[30:43] the holy ghost. And when the fullness of
[30:44] the godhead was poured into a body, he
[30:46] took an earthly name and that was the
[30:47] one name of the father, son, and holy
[30:49] ghost on earth. And that name is the
[30:51] Lord Jesus Christ. To me, it's simple.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; NOT BY EDUCATION, BUT BY REVELATION.
[30:56] AMEN. It's complicated when I have to DO
[30:59] IT BY STUDY and I have to do it by
[31:01] hermeneutics and I have to go into the
[31:03] Greek and I have to understand all of
[31:05] this. Listen, that's not how God wanted
[31:08] us to understand the Bible.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; He wanted to be by divine revelation.
[31:13] So he said it intentionally. The
[31:15] instructions were attention intentional.
[31:17] I can't remember who was here not long
[31:18] ago and and said, "Amen. If you have to
[31:21] believe everything by verbatim quote,
[31:24] then what is Peter doing misquing Jesus
[31:27] Christ?"
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; Because he says, "Repent and be baptized
[31:31] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[31:33] the remission of sins." And but but
[31:34] that's not what Jesus told him. Jesus
[31:36] didn't say those exact words.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; So you said he said something different
[31:40] than Jesus. I argue he didn't say
[31:42] anything different than Jesus.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; We say, "Well, HE DIDN'T QUOTE IT
[31:46] EXACT." I THINK HE QUOTED it exact.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; By revelation, he quoted the scriptures
[31:52] perfect.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:59] Praise be to God.
[32:02] He says, "Now watch now the next." He
[32:04] says, "And thou art Simon and I give
[32:07] unto thee." Because he had the spiritual
[32:09] revealed truth. That's the reason he
[32:11] knowed the difference between father,
[32:13] son, holy ghost, and the name of the
[32:14] Lord Jesus Christ. He had a spiritual
[32:16] revelation.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; That's why Peter could say what he said.
[32:22] He says, "Now there's three races of
[32:24] people on the earth. If you believe the
[32:26] Bible, there's only three races. Ham,
[32:27] Sham, and Japheth people, Jew, Gentile,
[32:29] and Samaritan. Peter with the keys at
[32:32] Pentecost opened it to the Jews. Philip
[32:34] went down and preached and baptized them
[32:36] down in Samaria. But Peter came down and
[32:38] laid hands on them. They received the
[32:40] Holy Ghost and the house of Cornelius.
[32:42] Then he had the keys that opened it to
[32:45] these three peoples. So God gave him the
[32:47] keys of the kingdom to open access to
[32:50] the kingdom of heaven. Amen. To all the
[32:53] people of the earth. Amen. And so Peter
[32:55] was instrumental in doing that. The day
[32:57] of Pentecost was the first use of the
[32:59] keys.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; It was the first opening. And that
[33:03] opening was when Peter stood up and
[33:05] said, "These men are not drunk as you
[33:07] suppose, but this is that which was
[33:09] spoken by the prophet Joel." And he
[33:11] starts to tie together the prophecy with
[33:13] the fulfillment of the prophecy.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. I want you to see this.
[33:19] Amen. Amen. And it was Peter's job.
[33:22] Amen. To open by the by by the by the
[33:25] keys of revelation. He was there to open
[33:27] unto them the mystery.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Right. And as he opened the mystery, the
[33:33] key opening the mystery to them that
[33:36] this is what the prophet Joel talked
[33:38] about. This is what the prophets were
[33:40] pointing to. This is who Jesus Christ
[33:42] was whom you with wicked hands had taken
[33:44] and crucified. He was the Lord of glory.
[33:46] He was the son of David. He was the
[33:48] prophecy being fulfilled. He was all of
[33:51] this. And what was he doing? He was
[33:52] revealing the mystery. And revealing the
[33:54] mystery was turning the key to the door
[33:56] and opening the door.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:00] But not everybody walked through the
[34:01] door.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; Then when Philip went down to the
[34:05] Samaritans, Philip was preaching, Amen.
[34:08] to the Samaritans the same thing that
[34:10] Peter preached on the day of Pentecost.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a different message. It was
[34:15] the same message. And he baptized the
[34:17] same way that Peter baptized on the day
[34:19] of Pentecost. So he preached the message
[34:21] and baptized. And they were only waiting
[34:23] for the one with the keys of the kingdom
[34:24] to come and lay hands on them. And they
[34:26] received the Holy Ghost because
[34:27] receiving the Holy Ghost is receiving
[34:29] the kingdom.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; And so now he went down there and then
[34:35] he went to the house of Cornelius. And
[34:37] in the house of Cornelius, Amen. while
[34:40] he was preaching the word. Oh, it's so
[34:42] beautiful, friends. Listen. He he he
[34:44] goes by the way of the Jews. Amen. And
[34:46] he goes to the Jews. And to the Jews, he
[34:48] breaks down the prophecy and tells them
[34:49] this and that. And then they say what we
[34:51] do. And he says, "Do this and you'll
[34:52] receive the Holy Ghost."
[34:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Philip goes to the Samaritans and
[34:56] brings them the word and they receive it
[34:58] and they're baptized and he comes down
[34:59] and he lays hands on them and they
[35:01] receive the Holy Ghost. But when he goes
[35:03] to the Gentiles, amen, the preaching of
[35:05] the word produces everything for the
[35:07] Gentiles. They start speaking in
[35:09] tongues. Amen. They start showing the
[35:11] same sign that they showed at Pentecost
[35:12] under the preaching of the word.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, the Bible is so perfect, friends.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; And then he says, well, hey, listen.
[35:22] Hey, listen. There's a formula to this.
[35:25] Amen. And you still need to be baptized
[35:27] in Jesus name. Amen. Who can forbid
[35:29] water to them that is received? Amen.
[35:31] The gift the same as we has received it.
[35:34] Amen. And so then he takes them and
[35:35] baptized them in the name of the Lord
[35:37] Jesus Christ because that's still the
[35:39] revelation of what they've received.
[35:41] They receive the spirit of Jesus Christ.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; And who was he? He was God made flesh.
[35:47] He was the word for their day. He was
[35:48] the fulfillment of the prophecy.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So all three people types receive
[35:54] the same revelation
[35:56] &gt;&gt; and the same baptism. But I just love
[35:59] the way that they receive it.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; I want to be like those in the house of
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Cornelius.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; I want to be healed by the preaching of
[36:06] the word. I want to be delivered by the
[36:07] preaching of the word. I want to be born
[36:09] again by the preaching of the word.
[36:10] Filled with the spirit by the pre
[36:11] everything by the preaching of the word
[36:13] because that's gentile faith.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:18] In the message investments, he says,
[36:22] "Simon Peter, we might speak of him a
[36:24] moment because he was mentioned this
[36:26] morning and one of the apostles and the
[36:27] one that had the keys to the kingdom."
[36:29] In other words, the knowledge how to
[36:32] unlock the doors to the kingdom. And we
[36:34] spoke of that last night, the key locked
[36:36] the door and unlocked it. And we heard
[36:40] of that last night, the original
[36:43] foundation.
[36:44] So the key the key was the mystery
[36:49] &gt;&gt; and the key can lock the door or unlock
[36:53] the door
[36:54] &gt;&gt; because a key can do both.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; When in the Bible when we go let's go to
[37:01] Acts chapter 2. Go with me to Acts
[37:02] chapter 2. Let's just jump over there
[37:04] for just a minute.
[37:17] In Acts chapter 2,
[37:19] you know, the rushing mighty wind came,
[37:22] the licks of fire was divided on each
[37:24] one. They began to speak with tongues
[37:26] and run into the street glorifying God.
[37:28] And all that was there gathered from all
[37:29] the nations. Every man heard in his own
[37:32] language what they were saying. Notable
[37:35] miracle to get the attention of the
[37:37] Jews. And then when their attention was
[37:38] gathered, he stands up and starts
[37:41] preaching modern events made clear by
[37:43] prophecy. I think that would be a good
[37:45] title to his first sermon.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; What you're seeing is what Joel said.
[37:50] What just happened in Jerusalem is what
[37:52] David said and what the what the the
[37:54] prophets have said. Amen. And all of
[37:56] this is explained. And as he explains
[37:58] it, listen, the formula that he's
[38:01] giving, the the mystery he's unlocking,
[38:03] the key that he's turning, Amen. for
[38:06] them. It doesn't become a formula by
[38:09] which you can you can you can replicate
[38:11] it intellectually
[38:14] &gt;&gt; where you can just say, "Well, I'm going
[38:16] to preach and and then you say, okay,
[38:18] and then I will take and baptize you in
[38:21] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[38:23] then you're going to get the Holy
[38:24] Ghost." It's not like that. That's not
[38:26] the way it was on the day of Pentecost.
[38:28] They said, "What should we do?" And he
[38:30] said, "This is what you do. First, you
[38:32] repent."
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And who who was repenting?
[38:37] Were they prostitutes and harlots?
[38:40] &gt;&gt; No, sir. They were gathering for the
[38:43] feast of Pentecost. They were devout
[38:44] Jews from all over the place coming back
[38:47] together for a religious feast to
[38:48] worship God according to the religion
[38:50] they had been raised in, according to
[38:52] the truth that they had been raised in.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; But now there was a dispensational
[38:58] change.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; And now he's preaching. Amen. He's
[39:01] opening the mystery of the
[39:03] dispensational change. And now he's
[39:05] saying, "Repent," which means change
[39:07] your mind. Turn from this. This was to
[39:10] lead you to this. Now you've got to turn
[39:12] from this to the new dispensational
[39:14] change. Amen. To the fulfillment of the
[39:16] prophecy, WHICH IS CHRIST JESUS.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; And even that was not just an
[39:23] intellectual exercise. If you go with me
[39:26] uh to verse
[39:28] 32, I'm just going to back up and catch
[39:30] a little bit of his sermon.
[39:32] He says, "This Acts 2 uh Acts 2:32, this
[39:36] Jesus hath God raised up whereof we all
[39:39] are witnesses. Therefore, being by the
[39:42] right hand of God exalted, and having
[39:43] received of the Father the promise of
[39:45] the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this
[39:47] which you now see and hear. For David
[39:50] has not ascended into the heavens, but
[39:51] he saith himself, "The Lord said to my
[39:53] Lord, sit thou on my right hand until I
[39:56] make thy foes thy foottools." He's
[39:58] preaching Old Testament prophecy.
[40:01] And then verse 36, therefore, let all
[40:03] the house of Israel know assuredly that
[40:05] God hath made that same Jesus whom you
[40:07] have crucified both Lord and Christ.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; He is the king. He is the Messiah. This
[40:14] is him. Yeah.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Now listen verse 37. I think this is the
[40:19] most important one.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Now when they heard this, they were
[40:23] pricricked in their heart.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; They were pricricked in their heart and
[40:30] said unto Peter and to the rest of the
[40:32] apostles, men and brethren, what shall
[40:34] we do?
[40:36] Listen, to me, this is the most critical
[40:38] part because there has to be somewhere
[40:41] for the fulfillment of prophecy, the
[40:43] mystery to strike.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; And where does it strike? It struck
[40:47] their heart.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; And they were pricricked in their heart.
[40:51] There was some that day who were not
[40:53] pricricked in their heart.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; This is not about going through the
[40:57] motions. This is not about copy and
[40:58] paste. This is not about repeat after
[41:00] me. This is about when the disposational
[41:03] change was manifest was preached and
[41:05] when he was declared to them the day
[41:07] that they were living in with the
[41:08] fulfillment prophecy for that day
[41:10] something inside of them began to jump
[41:13] and they were pricricked in their heart.
[41:14] THEY KNEW INSIDE THAT WHAT Peter was
[41:16] saying was the truth.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; AND THEY SAID NOW WHAT DO WE DO?
[41:22] &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T LIKE WHAT DO I need to do to
[41:24] go to heaven? I'll do what it takes to
[41:26] go to heaven. Give me the process. It
[41:28] wasn't that kind of thing friends. Amen.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; They were hearing the word preached. And
[41:33] when they heard the word for their hour
[41:35] priest and the fullness of the
[41:36] revelation, the mystery, the key opening
[41:39] up the the the kingdom of heaven TO
[41:41] THEM, SOMETHING INSIDE of them began to
[41:43] move. And they were pricked in their
[41:45] heart. And they said to Peter AND THE
[41:46] BRETHREN, "WHAT DO WE DO NOW?"
[41:50] &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THE TRUTH. AMEN.
[41:52] WE COME TO THIS FEAST. WE COME, WE'VE
[41:54] BEEN FULFILLING ALL THE LAW OF MOSES.
[41:55] We've been looking forward TO THIS DAY
[41:57] FOR GENERATIONS FROM GENERATIONS AND
[41:59] GENERATIONS. NOW, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
[42:01] TOUCHING ME IN MY SOUL. IT'S BRINGING A
[42:04] REACTION OUT OF ME. NOW, WHAT DO I DO?
[42:06] AND HE SAYS, REPENT. CHANGE YOUR MIND
[42:08] ABOUT ALL OF THIS AND COME TO THE OPEN
[42:10] WORD. COME TO THE TRUTH.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; AND BE BAPTIZED in the name of the Lord
[42:16] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins.
[42:18] AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE
[42:20] HOLY GHOST.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[42:22] IT STILL WORKS TODAY. THE SAME EXACT
[42:25] WAY, THE SAME EXACT FORMULA. NOT AS A
[42:28] FORMULA LIKE THE BAPTISTS DO. TAKE YOU
[42:30] THROUGH the old Roman road, read to you
[42:32] a couple scriptures, get you to agree
[42:33] with it, and repeat after me PRAYER AND
[42:35] YOU'RE SAVED. NOT THAT KIND OF PRAYER,
[42:37] NOT KIND OF SALVATION, BUT THE KIND FROM
[42:40] THE BIBLE, THE KIND FROM PENTECOST WHEN
[42:42] WHEN YOU PREACH THE PROPHECY FULFILLED
[42:44] IN YOUR DAY, THE WORD FOR THIS
[42:45] DISPENSATIONAL CHANGE THAT WE'RE IN
[42:47] RIGHT NOW, PREACHING CHRIST ALIVE IN OUR
[42:50] DAY. AMEN. TO GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
[42:52] THEM. THIS IS THE TRUTH. THIS IS THE
[42:54] DAY. NOT AS OUR FATHERS, BUT GOD HAS
[42:56] BROUGHT SOMETHING TO PASS IN OUR DAY.
[42:58] AND WHEN THEY HEAR THAT, THEY'RE
[42:59] PRICRICKED IN THEIR HEART. WHAT DO YOU
[43:01] DO THEN? REPENT FROM YOUR DENOMINATIONAL
[43:03] UNDERSTANDING. REPENT FROM YOUR WORLDLY
[43:04] IDEAS AND COME TO THIS JESUS CHRIST, THE
[43:07] truth revealed before you
[43:10] &gt;&gt; AND BE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF THE LORD
[43:12] JESUS CHRIST. AND YOU SHALL WITHOUT ANY
[43:14] SHADOW OF A DOUBT, WITHOUT ANY QUESTION,
[43:17] receive the baptism of the HOLY GHOST.
[43:19] THAT FORMULA STILL WORKS today
[43:22] &gt;&gt; if we approach it the same way
[43:24] &gt;&gt; and if it comes by the same results in
[43:26] effect.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; It's the revelation of the word.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[43:36] In Mark 16:15, he says, "And he said
[43:38] unto them, go you into all the world and
[43:41] preach the gospel to every creature. He
[43:44] that believeth and is baptized."
[43:47] Not he that's baptized,
[43:50] but he that believeth and is baptized.
[43:53] Believeth what?
[43:54] &gt;&gt; The gospel.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; What's the gospel? The good news.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Is God still have good news?
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Does he keep giving us more good news?
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Or do we have to just stay with the old
[44:08] good news
[44:09] &gt;&gt; or do we have today good news?
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; So we should preach the good news today
[44:16] &gt;&gt; to every creature. He that believeth and
[44:17] is baptized shall be saved, but he that
[44:21] believeth not shall be damned.
[44:25] So the same key can lock or unlock.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Same key.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; It can lock or unlock to those who were
[44:35] pricricked in their heart and could
[44:37] believe it and unlocked the kingdom of
[44:40] heaven to them. To those who disagreed
[44:44] and didn't like it and disbelieved and
[44:46] walked away, the door was locked.
[44:50] Even Paul and Barnabas when they were
[44:52] preaching to the mixed multitude of
[44:54] Gentiles and Jews in their missionary
[44:57] journey, they preached, but then the
[44:59] Jews, they they created a stir and they
[45:01] began to speak evil of those things,
[45:03] contradicting the things that Paul and
[45:05] Barnabas said. And Paul, they waxed bold
[45:08] and they said, "Seeing how you ha have
[45:11] refused or you count yourself unworthy
[45:13] of everlasting life."
[45:16] &gt;&gt; To them, the door was locked.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Because you count yourself unworthy of
[45:22] everlasting life, lo, we turn to the
[45:24] Gentiles.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; And did the Bible say the Gentiles
[45:30] rejoiced? Yes.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; And did it say that all the Gentiles
[45:33] believed?
[45:35] &gt;&gt; No.
[45:36] It said those that were ordained unto
[45:39] eternal life believed.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; They were pricricked in their heart.
[45:43] They were rejoicing because they were
[45:46] ordained to eternal life and they
[45:48] believed. So the message that Paul and
[45:51] Barnabas brought to one group was an
[45:54] unlocking
[45:55] to another group was a locking.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the God of this evil age, I
[46:02] don't have the quote for the overhead,
[46:03] but I I have it here with me. And the
[46:05] god of this evil age, he says, notice
[46:06] Cain. He didn't want no blood sacrifice.
[46:10] He come down and offered the fruit or
[46:12] the fields of beauty upon his altar.
[46:14] Very religious, done everything just
[46:16] exactly like Abel done. Offered a
[46:19] sacrifice, fell down before God in
[46:21] worship, obedient in every way, but
[46:23] without the revelation of the word. And
[46:26] the word was from the beginning God's
[46:29] plan. But God revealed by revelation the
[46:33] very thing that he vindicated and
[46:35] punctuated that was right. Not religion,
[46:38] not an altar, not belonging to church,
[46:41] not making a sacrifice, not being
[46:43] sincere, but by the revelation of the
[46:46] word of God. What was God's plan for
[46:49] salvation from the beginning?
[46:50] Revelation. Revelation of the word. went
[46:54] all the way back in the beginning in the
[46:57] book of Genesis when when Cain and Abel
[46:59] came to worship God, Brother Benham said
[47:01] they both loved God.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; And they both desired to worship God.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; So you can't just base it off, well I
[47:11] love God, they love God. We love God.
[47:12] Cain loved God.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; They want to go to church. They want to
[47:17] worship. They want to Cain wanted to
[47:19] worship. Yeah.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; All the Jews who rejected Jesus wanted
[47:23] to worship.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; They went through great efforts
[47:28] &gt;&gt; to keep the law and to worship according
[47:30] to the commandments.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; But they didn't have what that what it
[47:34] took to believe.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; So it's got to be something more than
[47:39] just religious effort.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; It's got to be more than just religious
[47:43] zeal.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; It's got to be more than just the effort
[47:46] we put in. Although we should put
[47:48] effort. Absolutely. without a doubt. But
[47:50] but but that alone didn't work for Cain.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Because Cain didn't have a revelation of
[47:58] the word of what it took to bring an
[48:01] atonement. He had no revelation. And so
[48:03] he was trying by a works program and by
[48:06] religion and by a beautiful altar. He
[48:08] was trying to appease God with with
[48:10] beauty and with work and with all that
[48:12] he could do to produce the best he could
[48:14] to appease the wrath of God and find and
[48:16] for God to find pleasure with him and
[48:18] acceptance in the eyes of God. And God
[48:20] did not accept his sacrifice. That's
[48:23] right.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; But Abel, Amen. without a lot of effort,
[48:28] without a lot of religious work, without
[48:30] a lot of intellectualism, he just caught
[48:33] a revelation and an understanding of
[48:35] what happened in Eden and what was wrong
[48:36] with the blood and that there had to be
[48:38] a blood covering. And he caught it by
[48:40] revelation. And listen, revelation
[48:42] doesn't take months and months to catch.
[48:43] I mean, you can catch it in less than a
[48:45] fraction of a second. I don't even think
[48:47] time can account because it's an eternal
[48:48] thing with God. And all of a sudden,
[48:50] like a flash of lightning, your eyes are
[48:52] open and you see something you've never
[48:53] seen before. Amen. That's by God. Amen.
[48:56] God did that. AND GOD IN A FLASH, AMEN,
[48:59] Abel knew all of a sudden what it was.
[49:01] How can I appease God? How can I How can
[49:03] I find an atonement FOR MY SIN? WHY AM I
[49:06] OUT OF THE GARDEN? WHY AM I wearing
[49:07] these clothes? Why Why is everything
[49:09] falling apart? WHAT'S WRONG? AND ALL OF
[49:11] A SUDDEN, IN A FLASH, HE REALIZED what
[49:13] happened in the garden. And he knew it
[49:15] had to be the shedding of blood for the
[49:17] remission of sins. There had to be an
[49:18] atonement of blood
[49:20] &gt;&gt; cuz the problem is in the blood. And so
[49:22] now what he comes and offers, LISTEN, HE
[49:25] DOESN'T offer a prettier sacrifice. He
[49:28] doesn't offer a more expensive
[49:29] sacrifice. He doesn't offer more
[49:32] religious zeal. What he OFFERS BACK TO
[49:34] GOD IS A PRODUCT OF the revelation that
[49:36] he has in his heart. AND GOD SAW HE GETS
[49:39] IT. HE UNDERSTANDS. He knows the
[49:42] dispensation. He knows WHAT WENT WRONG.
[49:44] AND GOD ACCEPTED HIS sacrifice and
[49:46] ACCEPTED ABEL AND REJECTED CAIN. And it
[49:49] had nothing to do WITH EFFORT OR WORK or
[49:52] merit or it didn't have anything to do
[49:54] with morality. It didn't have anything
[49:56] to do with any of those things.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; IT WAS BASED SOLELY ON THE EXPRESSION of
[50:03] his revelation.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS GOD'S PLAN from the
[50:08] beginning was the word, the revealed
[50:11] word.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. That's why that's why
[50:18] God could give the keys of the kingdom
[50:21] to an illiterate fisherman.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Because if it was going to be some
[50:27] religious thing uh like a system and a
[50:30] form of worship and if it was going to
[50:32] be something that would take great
[50:34] effort and intellectualism and a
[50:36] theology book and and all of this, he
[50:39] would have needed to get somebody who
[50:41] could read.
[50:43] I mean, that would be like step one.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Right.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Because you could at least write out the
[50:47] program
[50:48] &gt;&gt; because on this holiday you got to do
[50:50] this and and on this day you got to do
[50:51] this and you got to bring this kind of
[50:53] sacrifice and you got to do this thing
[50:54] and that thing. If that was the way God
[50:56] was going to do it, Amen. He would have
[50:58] needed somebody who could read or write.
[51:00] But but that's not what he wanted. Amen.
[51:02] God wanted Amen. to have a a a divine
[51:06] revelation of the word. Amen.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; So he didn't give the keys, Amen, to the
[51:11] to the most capable, Amen,
[51:14] intellectually, humanistically speaking,
[51:16] but he gave the keys to somebody that
[51:18] already proved they could get divine
[51:19] revelation from the father.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; And he could trust him with those keys.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; That's why our prophet had a seventh
[51:27] grade education.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh, thank God." He had to
[51:30] entrust somebody that could operate by
[51:32] divine revelation.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love it.
[51:38] So many times, Brother Bennett is
[51:39] mispronouncing something in the Bible.
[51:42] He's saying the wrong word or the wrong
[51:44] name or even quoting the wrong
[51:46] scripture. And I love it.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; I absolutely love it.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God didn't need, Amen, a
[51:54] polished scholar to bring his message.
[51:56] He needed somebody who could receive
[51:58] revelation from the father.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; He didn't have a polished scholar in
[52:02] Peter and he didn't need one in this
[52:04] day. Amen. And the one polished scholar
[52:06] he had was the Saul who became Paul. And
[52:09] he had to go beat out all of his
[52:11] intellectualism and all of his knowledge
[52:12] out of him and get him to forsake it and
[52:14] count it as dung and wish he hadn't had
[52:16] it.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; So that he could use him.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So
[52:25] to one it's locked, to one it's
[52:28] unlocked.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:32] And I'm so thankful to me it's unlocked
[52:37] &gt;&gt; because I didn't do one blessed thing to
[52:40] unlock it.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; I didn't earn it.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; I didn't deserve it.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; I didn't pay for it. I wasn't a good
[52:49] enough boy. I wasn't religious enough. I
[52:52] didn't have enough zeal or fervor. I had
[52:54] nothing that would give me enough merit
[52:56] for God to give me a revelation of his
[52:58] word. He did it solely by grace
[53:02] &gt;&gt; because I'm a babe.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; If God has given you revelation of his
[53:06] word and indicates one thing for sure,
[53:08] you're a babe.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; You're one of his babes.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother says, "The Bible said that
[53:19] Peter was an ignorant and unlearned man.
[53:22] He couldn't even sign his own name, but
[53:24] it pleased God to give him the keys to
[53:26] the kingdom because he seen the Messiah
[53:28] and noted his evidence and fell at his
[53:30] feet and recognized him as the Messiah.
[53:32] He believed the word and and and thou
[53:35] art Peter, I say unto thee, thou art
[53:37] Peter, and upon this rock I'll build my
[53:39] church. Not upon Peter, not upon Jesus,
[53:42] but upon his spiritual revelation of who
[53:44] he was.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Same thing he did Abel. Abel by faith
[53:48] offered to God a more excellent
[53:50] sacrifice than that of Cain. Both boys
[53:52] offered. Both boys prayed. Both boys
[53:56] built an altar. Both boys worshiped the
[53:58] same God. One was accepted and the other
[54:00] one turned down because by revelation
[54:04] Abel saw it wasn't fruits or apples that
[54:07] brought us out of the Garden of Eden. It
[54:08] was blood and he offered blood and God
[54:11] received it.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:20] The Jews asked Jesus one day, "What can
[54:23] we do to do the works of God?"
[54:27] He said, "Well, keep all the feast and
[54:30] take care of the widows and tithe and do
[54:32] a little more offering."
[54:34] He said, "Believe on him whom thou has
[54:36] sent."
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; What can you do?
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Believe the one I I sent.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; With the revelation of the word for your
[54:45] hour.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:47] What does it mean to believe the one
[54:48] whom he has sent? Why did God ever send
[54:51] a prophet?
[54:53] &gt;&gt; God always sent a prophet to give them
[54:55] the word for the dispensation they were
[54:57] in.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; He always sent a prophet to give them
[55:00] the current present tense truth of God.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; And what can we do that we might do the
[55:07] works of God?
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Believe.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; On what? the one that God sent with the
[55:17] current present tense truth.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Receive the revelation of the word.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what Abel could do is he
[55:26] could receive the word. Cain could not.
[55:29] Even when Cain was given instructions,
[55:32] &gt;&gt; why don't you just do like Abel, your
[55:34] brother? Won't it be well with thee? He
[55:35] couldn't do it. Amen. It angered him. It
[55:37] upset him. He had no understanding. He
[55:39] didn't know why. He couldn't see any
[55:41] reason why Abel would be accepted and he
[55:43] wouldn't be accepted.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. because he didn't understand
[55:46] revelation.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Listen, I can't explain to you. I can't
[55:50] give you any good reason why my worship
[55:53] would be accepted and somebody else's
[55:55] would not.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Because it's not like I do better.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; If you ever hear me sing, you'd realize
[56:02] that
[56:04] based on my merit alone, God shouldn't
[56:06] accept my praise in song.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; But I'm singing from a heart of
[56:13] revelation. The words mean something to
[56:15] me. I understand what I'm saying. Amen.
[56:18] Because of the revelation of the hour
[56:19] that God has given us. Our worship is
[56:22] not a worship of routine. Our worship is
[56:24] not a worship. Amen. Where we're
[56:25] subjugated to the rudiments of a church
[56:28] system. Amen. And as long as we do
[56:29] everything right according to the church
[56:31] system, we'll be accepted by God. God
[56:33] has never wanted that. That has never
[56:35] been his desire. What God wants is
[56:37] somebody to give him back. Amen. The
[56:39] revelation that he puts in their heart.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. and to worship him in spirit and
[56:45] in truth.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; And a man, this is what brother Bam says
[56:52] again, and a man that was so illiterate
[56:55] that he could not even sign his own
[56:56] name. We are told, the Bible said in the
[56:59] book of Acts of the Apostles, the third
[57:01] chapter, that he was both ignorant and
[57:03] unlearned. But it pleased God to make
[57:05] him the head of the church at Jerusalem
[57:07] and give him the keys to the kingdom.
[57:09] Because when that predestinated seed
[57:11] laying there in that old fisherman and
[57:13] when the light struck it quickly it
[57:15] recognized that that was the Messiah.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; That's why he gave him the keys. Amen.
[57:21] Praise God. This is the scripture
[57:23] brother's referring to in Acts 4:10.
[57:26] Says, "Be it known unto you all and to
[57:28] all the people of Israel that by the
[57:29] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom
[57:32] ye crucified, who God raised from the
[57:34] dead, even by him did this man stand
[57:37] here before you whole." This is the
[57:40] stone which was set it not of the
[57:41] builders, which has become the head of
[57:43] the corner. Hey, listen. I absolutely
[57:45] love when he starts preaching like this
[57:48] because before his conversion, Amen,
[57:52] Peter got a revelation from God and he
[57:54] knew who Jesus was, but he hadn't put
[57:56] the whole program together yet. He
[57:57] didn't understand how it tied in with
[57:59] the scriptures and he didn't understand
[58:01] the prophecies and he was fighting
[58:02] against the very word of God that Jesus
[58:04] had to be taken and and crucified and
[58:07] raised again the third day. He was
[58:08] actually fighting the word because he
[58:10] didn't have a revelation of the word
[58:11] yet. Amen. But something happened. Amen.
[58:14] At the baptism of the Holy Ghost, God
[58:16] unlocked an understanding inside of him.
[58:19] And on the road to Emmas, we know that
[58:21] Jesus in his resurrected ministry, he
[58:24] began to break down the word and he
[58:26] began to to un he began to open the
[58:29] scriptures to them.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; And then when he get saw them all
[58:33] gathered in behind the closed doors and
[58:35] he stepped in amongst their mist. Amen.
[58:37] He began to open their understanding to
[58:40] understand the scriptures. So this has
[58:42] been working on Peter and the
[58:43] resurrection ministry of Jesus Christ.
[58:45] He begins to open the word and he begins
[58:47] to open understanding. And now when the
[58:50] fire of the Holy Ghost comes and LIGHTS
[58:51] IT ALL OFF, ALL OF A SUDDEN Peter runs
[58:54] out and he's no more scared and he's no
[58:56] more angry and he's no more fighting and
[58:58] none of what none of what he was trying
[59:00] to do, amen, to produce something. It
[59:02] all stops. And now he comes OUT AND HE
[59:04] SAYS THE WORD says and the word says and
[59:06] the word says and the word says and now
[59:08] he's been arrested for healing a man.
[59:10] He's been taken before the the
[59:12] Sanhedrin. They got him standing in the
[59:14] council. The very Jews he was running
[59:16] from and hiding from because he was
[59:17] afraid to get arrested. He was afraid to
[59:19] be associated with Jesus Christ. He was
[59:21] afraid to be grouped into the Galileans
[59:23] that were following that man of
[59:24] Nazareth. Amen. NOW, HE STANDS RIGHT UP
[59:27] IN the midst of them and says, "Listen,
[59:28] this is the stone THAT THE BUILDER,"
[59:30] WHAT'S HE DOING? HE'S QUOTING THE OLD
[59:31] TESTAMENT PROPHECIES BY REVELATION. AND
[59:34] HE KNOWS EXACTLY where he's standing and
[59:36] he's giving to them where he's in the
[59:38] Sanhedrin with the keys TO THE KINGDOM,
[59:40] OPENING A DOOR FOR THEM. AMEN. And
[59:42] they're turning IT AND LOCKING IT BACK.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Cuz they don't want it to be true.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Right.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; So I love to listen to Peter preach on
[59:53] the day of Pentecost and every other
[59:55] dialogue that he has absolutely thrills
[59:57] my heart. This is the same man that ran
[59:59] away and when a maiden asked him the
[1:00:01] third time, "Are you one of them?" He
[1:00:03] began to curse. He began to swear and
[1:00:04] say, "I know not the man." And run out
[1:00:06] and we wet bitterly. Listen, God did not
[1:00:09] give him these keys because he was the
[1:00:11] most upstanding citizen.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; But because he could receive divine
[1:00:16] revelation from the father,
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; and when it lit off at the baptism of
[1:00:22] the Holy Ghost, this is the stone which
[1:00:24] was set at not of you builders, which
[1:00:27] has become the head of the corner.
[1:00:28] What's he doing? He's listen he's not
[1:00:31] just quoting a prophecy.
[1:00:34] He's placing it.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; This is the stone which was said it not
[1:00:40] of you builders.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; You're in the prophecy.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; This prophecy is for today.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; They're so angry at him because he's
[1:00:54] interpreting the word.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:59] Amen.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; This is the stone which was set it not
[1:01:02] of you builders which is become the head
[1:01:06] of the corner.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Neither is there salvation in any other.
[1:01:10] For there is none other name under
[1:01:11] heaven given among men where we must be
[1:01:13] saved. Listen where is Peter saying I
[1:01:16] think I feel like
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; according to my study
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; I see it as this way.
[1:01:24] NO, THIS MAN IS OPERATING by divine
[1:01:26] revelation from the father. And he knows
[1:01:28] exactly the prophecy that's fulfilled
[1:01:29] for his day.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Said there is neither is there salvation
[1:01:33] in any other for there is none other
[1:01:35] name under heaven given among men
[1:01:37] whereby we must be saved. Now when they
[1:01:40] saw the boldness of Peter and John and
[1:01:42] perceived that they were unlearned and
[1:01:44] ignorant, this means this means uh
[1:01:47] illiterate and uneducated.
[1:01:50] They marveled and they took knowledge of
[1:01:52] them that they had been with Jesus.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; They listen.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; They didn't give him a writing
[1:02:01] assignment.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; They could just tell by being around
[1:02:06] him.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; I want you to see this word here.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Perceived.
[1:02:14] They perceived
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; that they were unlearned and ignorant
[1:02:19] men.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; It was obvious, friends.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Can we just put it that way?
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; It was obvious he shouldn't be talking
[1:02:27] like that.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Where did he get that understanding?
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; You ever witness to somebody? Amen.
[1:02:34] Somebody who claims, you know, they
[1:02:36] really know the Bible really well and
[1:02:37] after you've been witnessing to for a
[1:02:38] while, they're like, "Where did you get
[1:02:39] all this?" Right?
[1:02:42] You know why? They perceived that you
[1:02:44] were unlearned.
[1:02:50] They perceived that. Listen, you're no
[1:02:52] theologian. You know, Dr. Din, you
[1:02:54] shouldn't know your Bible that well. You
[1:02:56] shouldn't be able to put all Where did
[1:02:58] you You didn't get this by study because
[1:03:01] you're not that smart.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; That's really what they're saying to
[1:03:04] you. And if they ever do that to you
[1:03:06] again, YOU GO, "PRAISE GOD. I GOT IT BY
[1:03:08] DIVINE revelation from the Father. God
[1:03:11] sent a man in our day that unlocked
[1:03:13] another key. Amen. Another
[1:03:14] dispensational change. And there was
[1:03:16] something in my HEART THAT WAS
[1:03:17] PRICRICKED UNDER THAT PREACHING.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; And he brought us right back to the
[1:03:23] formula and right back to water baptism
[1:03:25] in Jesus' name and right back to the
[1:03:27] dispensation of truth.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; They perceived that they were ignorant
[1:03:31] and unlearned. Unlearned and ignorant
[1:03:33] men and they marveled that they took
[1:03:35] knowledge of them that they had been
[1:03:36] with Jesus.
[1:03:38] Oh, praise God. God, give us a divine
[1:03:41] revelation of your word.
[1:03:45] And the message paradox
[1:03:47] says, "The smartest men he had was
[1:03:49] emperors and kings and potentates and
[1:03:51] monarchs, high priests and churchmen."
[1:03:54] He could have took any of those. But it
[1:03:57] was a paradox when he called a man who
[1:03:59] couldn't even sign his own name and
[1:04:01] said, "I give you the keys to the
[1:04:02] kingdom. Whatever you bind on earth,
[1:04:04] I'll bind in heaven. What you loose on
[1:04:07] earth, I'll loose in heaven. Say, I just
[1:04:09] thought of of that about that vision. He
[1:04:11] was brother speaking of a vision that he
[1:04:13] had. What you loose or bind. What you
[1:04:15] bind on earth, I'll bind in heaven. What
[1:04:16] you loose on earth, I'll loose in
[1:04:18] heaven. He Yes, he give that not to a
[1:04:21] learned high priest, Caiaphasis,
[1:04:23] Caiaphas, but to an ignorant fisherman.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, listen. I don't want to keep putting
[1:04:29] this off on Peter
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; or even on brother Brandham.
[1:04:36] But if he would do that for Peter, he
[1:04:38] could give me the revelation of the
[1:04:40] word.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Listen, I at least I can read.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; But Paul had to come to the place where
[1:04:52] even his ability to read became his
[1:04:54] dong.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; That didn't do me any good.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Paul got to the place where he said, "I
[1:05:00] went to the best school of Galia. I was
[1:05:01] born a Pharisee of the Pharisees. I'm of
[1:05:03] the tribe of Benjamin. I was up with the
[1:05:06] up and ups and I was all of this, that,
[1:05:07] and the other. And then he says, "Didn't
[1:05:09] do me no good.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Reading and education and all that." It
[1:05:13] it failed me.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; I counted as all done. But when I come
[1:05:17] in contact with the pillar of fire, all
[1:05:18] of a sudden, I knew everything I knew
[1:05:20] was wrong.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; And Christ took me out to the backside
[1:05:23] of a desert for three years and three
[1:05:25] and a half years, and he taught me the
[1:05:27] scriptures correctly.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Thank God. Lord, teach me the scriptures
[1:05:32] correctly.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam, now now he's coming down to
[1:05:37] the marriage and divorce. We know in the
[1:05:38] marriage divorce is where he says, "The
[1:05:39] Lord told him to come and tell the
[1:05:41] people, I forgive you,
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; but don't you ever do it again."
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; And he gets some uh uh flak from a a
[1:05:47] woman, it said, he's going to talk about
[1:05:49] it here. He says, "As in the marriage
[1:05:50] and divorce case the other day, when the
[1:05:52] Holy Spirit had told me that, I come
[1:05:54] said it just the way he told me. Some
[1:05:56] minister lady give me a right sharp
[1:05:58] little balling out." She said, 'I guess
[1:06:00] you take the place of God.' I said, 'N
[1:06:02] no, ma'am. Said, 'Well, you told them
[1:06:04] their sins is forgiven.' Said, where?'
[1:06:07] He said, only God has power. See another
[1:06:11] see another Pharisee.
[1:06:14] She said, listen, she's saying you you
[1:06:16] told them their sins were forgiven.
[1:06:18] You're wrong.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Well, God told him he could say that,
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; He said it just the way God told him to
[1:06:24] say it.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this woman,
[1:06:28] she says, "Well, you told her sins were
[1:06:30] forgiven. Only God has power." And
[1:06:32] brother said, "See, another Pharisee.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; She doesn't even understand."
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Another Pharisee. I said, "You see that
[1:06:42] you might know that Jesus told Peter and
[1:06:44] the apostles after he had the revelation
[1:06:46] of who he was, he told them, thou art
[1:06:49] Christ, the son of God." He said,
[1:06:51] "Blessed art thou, thou son of Jonas.
[1:06:53] Flesh and blood never revealed this to
[1:06:54] you, but my father which is in heaven
[1:06:56] has revealed it. Upon this rock I'll
[1:06:58] build my church. The gates of hell can't
[1:07:00] prevail against it. And I give unto thee
[1:07:02] the keys. Whatever you bind on earth,
[1:07:03] I'll bind in heaven. What you loose on
[1:07:05] earth. That's the divine revelation of
[1:07:08] the word made flesh.
[1:07:11] What was it? It was the divine
[1:07:13] revelation of the word made flesh.
[1:07:16] If it was flesh in that day by the son,
[1:07:18] the groom, it is flesh today by the
[1:07:20] bride.
[1:07:21] Whosoever sins you remit, to them they
[1:07:23] are remitted. Whosoever sins you retain,
[1:07:26] to them they are retained.
[1:07:28] Now the Catholic Church picked that up
[1:07:30] and takes it to their priest. But that's
[1:07:32] carnal.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Watch. It was the spiritual revealed
[1:07:37] word that did it.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; It wasn't somebody saying, "Oh, now
[1:07:42] you're forgiven." No. Brother Brenham
[1:07:44] said those that are following this
[1:07:47] message
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; to you that that believe me and are
[1:07:52] following this message to you.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Who was forgiveness given to? To those
[1:07:59] that had a revelation of the message,
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; the revealed word for the hour.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Watch. It was the spiritual revealed
[1:08:08] word that did it. That's the reason he
[1:08:11] told them to go baptize in the name of
[1:08:12] father, son, holy ghost. He knowed they
[1:08:15] knew who he was.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; The reason he told them, brother Ben
[1:08:19] says to baptize in the name of father
[1:08:21] and son and holy ghost is because he
[1:08:23] knew that they knew who he was.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; THEY HAD CAUGHT IT BY REVELATION. AND SO
[1:08:28] THEY gave the revelation.
[1:08:31] AND BROTHER BENHAM TIES THIS together to
[1:08:34] his ability to stand before a group of
[1:08:36] people that are caught in a bunch of
[1:08:38] messed up marriages because of clergy,
[1:08:40] because of religious leaders, because of
[1:08:42] church systems that had taught the word
[1:08:44] wrong, that had left the word
[1:08:46] generations ago, taught it wrong, and
[1:08:48] the people were stuck in ignorance. But
[1:08:50] at the opening of the seals, and at the
[1:08:51] opening of the word, when the word came
[1:08:53] back, these people received the word.
[1:08:56] Brother Brandham didn't say everybody in
[1:08:58] here is forgiven. Those who are
[1:09:00] following this message, those who have
[1:09:02] caught the revelation, those who believe
[1:09:04] the word and because of your faith in
[1:09:06] the word that you're hearing, God has
[1:09:08] forgiven you of that sin because that
[1:09:10] sin was done in ignorance because of
[1:09:12] wrong teaching by clergymen and pastors
[1:09:14] and preachers. BUT NOW AT THE OPENING of
[1:09:16] the word, HE SAYS, I HE SAID, GOD TOLD
[1:09:19] ME TO TELL YOU, I forgive you.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; What was it? It was the spiritual
[1:09:26] revealed word that did it.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Then he talks ABOUT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
[1:09:31] picked that up and now you go into a
[1:09:33] confessional booth with a priest and you
[1:09:35] tell the priest everything you did wrong
[1:09:37] and he tells you some little thing you
[1:09:38] have to do. Hail Marys or whatever some
[1:09:40] penance you do that and then you'll be
[1:09:42] forgiven and he forgives you. He's
[1:09:44] taking the scripture carnally upon a
[1:09:46] human being and saying that he has the
[1:09:48] power to forgive. And then that was
[1:09:50] never placed in human flesh and a human
[1:09:52] being with a HUMAN MIND. IT'S ALWAYS
[1:09:54] BEEN BY THE REVEALED WORD. And if a man
[1:09:57] will preach the word of God, amen, the
[1:09:59] true word for the hour that we live in,
[1:10:01] that word has a power to cleanse you
[1:10:03] from all sin. HAS A POWER TO SET YOU
[1:10:05] free from the bondage that you're in. IT
[1:10:07] HAS A POWER TO FORGIVE YOU OF ALL SINS.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT BROTHER BENHAM'S TELLING US
[1:10:12] HERE. IT'S THE SPIRITUAL REVEALED WORD
[1:10:14] THAT DID IT. IT wasn't just A MAN
[1:10:16] SAYING, "I FORGIVE YOU." HE SAID, "I FOR
[1:10:18] ALL THOSE THAT ARE FOLLOWING THIS
[1:10:20] MESSAGE, everyone that believes this TO
[1:10:22] BE TRUE." GOD TOLD ME I COULD TELL YOU
[1:10:24] WHY. BECAUSE WHEN THE WORD OPENED,
[1:10:26] SOMETHING INSIDE OF THEM WAS PRICRICKED
[1:10:28] AND THEY SAID, "THAT'S NOTHING BUT THE
[1:10:30] TRUTH." THEY FIND THEMSELVES CONDEMNED.
[1:10:32] THEY FIND THEMSELVES in a bad situation.
[1:10:34] BUT THERE WAS something else in them
[1:10:35] THAT COULD RECOGNIZE WHAT THAT MAN JUST
[1:10:37] PREACHED IS NOTHING BUT the truth.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; And God could forgive them.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; The key was open and they went through
[1:10:48] the door. But those who rejected the
[1:10:50] message,
[1:10:53] he said it was for those who are
[1:10:54] following the message
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; to my church, to my people, those who
[1:10:59] are following this message.
[1:11:04] In John 6, he says, "Then Simon Peter
[1:11:06] answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go?
[1:11:09] Thou hast the words of eternal life, and
[1:11:12] we believe and are sure that thou art
[1:11:15] that Christ, the son of the living God.
[1:11:19] This is why God could trust him with the
[1:11:21] keys even later. Amen. When everybody
[1:11:24] walked away.
[1:11:26] Oh, this is why Peter could be trusted.
[1:11:30] When the when the crowds departed
[1:11:33] because they were confused about the
[1:11:35] message that was being preached when the
[1:11:38] ministerial association left him.
[1:11:41] When when the 70 close associates that
[1:11:44] went out two by two, Amen. preparing the
[1:11:46] way for him to come preach and doing
[1:11:48] miracles and all of these things when
[1:11:50] they got confused about the word he was
[1:11:52] preaching and they walked away.
[1:11:55] Then he turns to the disciples
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; and he says, "Will you go also?"
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; This is when Peter says this
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; when it gets down to the wire. Amen.
[1:12:09] When it gets down to it, Amen. Peter
[1:12:11] doesn't know about drinking blood. Peter
[1:12:13] doesn't know about eating flesh. Peter
[1:12:15] doesn't understand why everybody's
[1:12:16] walking away. Peter's is confused. Peter
[1:12:19] doesn't understand what Jesus was saying
[1:12:21] anymore than the people who walked away.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; But something inside of him come alive.
[1:12:30] Amen. Through the dispensation he was
[1:12:32] in. And he knew, I don't know what
[1:12:34] you're saying. I don't know why they're
[1:12:35] leaving. I don't know what's happening.
[1:12:37] I don't fully comprehend what's going on
[1:12:39] right now. But I I know I know thou has
[1:12:43] the words of eternal life. And we
[1:12:45] BELIEVE AND ARE SURE. HOW WAS HE SURE?
[1:12:48] HE WASN'T SURE INTELLECTUALLY. HE WAS
[1:12:50] SURE IN HIS SOUL.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THE FATHER GAVE HIM A
[1:12:54] REVELATION. That's the only way you can
[1:12:56] be sure.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; And we believe and are sure that thou
[1:12:59] art, the son of the living God.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; This is why God gave him the keys.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Luke 17
[1:13:09] says, "And as it was in the days of
[1:13:11] Noah, so shall it be also in the days of
[1:13:14] the Son of Man. They did eat, they
[1:13:17] drank, they married wives, they were
[1:13:19] given in marriage until the day that
[1:13:20] Noah entered into the ark, and the flood
[1:13:23] came and destroyed them all." Likewise
[1:13:26] also, as it was in the days of Lot, they
[1:13:28] did eat, they drank, they bought, they
[1:13:29] sold, they planted, they builded. But
[1:13:32] the same day that Lot went out of Sodom,
[1:13:34] it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[1:13:36] and destroyed them all. Even thus shall
[1:13:39] it be in the day when the Son of Man is
[1:13:42] revealed.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Anybody have any idea what this prophecy
[1:13:47] is about? What period of time?
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Today,
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; this day, this scripture is being
[1:13:57] fulfilled. Right.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; These are the days of Noah as it was in
[1:14:01] the days of Noah. As it was in the days
[1:14:03] of Sodom, that's this day. How many
[1:14:05] times did Brother Benham used this
[1:14:06] scripture to point us to his ministry?
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; It's in those days is when the son of
[1:14:12] man is being revealed.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ was being revealed 2,000
[1:14:19] years ago. Amen. In a body of flesh as
[1:14:22] Jesus of Nazareth. Amen. And there was
[1:14:24] some there that were catching the
[1:14:25] revelation. And that revelation was
[1:14:27] changing their lives. And they were
[1:14:29] recognizing, "Thou you, this man, this
[1:14:31] flesh, this body, YOU THAT'S STANDING
[1:14:33] HERE WALKING, TALKING to me, eating
[1:14:35] bread across the table from me in a
[1:14:37] boat, YOU ARE CHRIST, THE son of the
[1:14:39] living God."
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; That was a tremendous revelation. But
[1:14:42] here's a prophecy of another day, an end
[1:14:45] time sign, an end time. Amen. Where it's
[1:14:47] going to be the days of Noah again. It's
[1:14:49] going to be as it was. And in the days
[1:14:50] of Noah, man's heart was continually on
[1:14:53] evil. And he did all that was in the
[1:14:54] imaginations of his heart. Amen. And and
[1:14:56] men were were taking wives as they
[1:14:59] choose. There was marriage and divorce
[1:15:00] on the rampage. Amen. The violence had
[1:15:02] filled the earth. Amen. In Sodom. Amen.
[1:15:04] They were in a sodomite condition where
[1:15:06] there was immorality because of lust and
[1:15:08] homosexuality and and all kinds of
[1:15:11] perversion sexually. Amen. And brother
[1:15:13] Brandham showed us that to show we're in
[1:15:15] that age.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; But in this day, the son of man is going
[1:15:20] to be revealed.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:25] Who's going to see it?
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; He was being revealed in his first
[1:15:31] coming.
[1:15:33] He's being revealed in this coming.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; But who can see it? Only babes.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Only those who can get a revelation from
[1:15:42] the father.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Let's turn to 1 Corinthians 2 together.
[1:15:59] 1 Corinthians chapter 2:6.
[1:16:06] How be it we speak wisdom among them
[1:16:09] that are perfect. Yet not the wisdom of
[1:16:11] this world, nor of the princes of this
[1:16:13] world that come to not. But we speak the
[1:16:16] wisdom of God in a mystery, even the
[1:16:19] hidden wisdom which God ordained before
[1:16:21] the world unto our glory.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Which none of the princes of this world
[1:16:25] knew. For had they known it, they would
[1:16:27] not have crucified the Lord of glory.
[1:16:30] But as it is written, I had not seen nor
[1:16:32] ear heard, neither entered into the
[1:16:34] heart of man the things which God hath
[1:16:36] prepared for them that love him. But,
[1:16:40] oh, I love this.
[1:16:43] But,
[1:16:44] it's never entered into the heart of
[1:16:46] man. Man has never seen. Man has never
[1:16:48] heard. It's never entered into his heart
[1:16:50] the things that the Lord's prepared.
[1:16:52] But,
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; but,
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; but God hath revealed them unto us by
[1:17:00] his spirit.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; We're not still stuck behind the veil of
[1:17:04] ignorance. We're not still stuck behind
[1:17:06] of darkness. There's been an unveiling.
[1:17:08] But God has revealed them to us by his
[1:17:10] spirit. For the spirit searchth all
[1:17:12] things, yay, the deep things of God. For
[1:17:15] what man knoweth the things of man, save
[1:17:17] the spirit of man which is in him? Even
[1:17:19] so the things of God knoweth no man, but
[1:17:21] the spirit of God. Now we have received
[1:17:24] not the spirit of the world, but the
[1:17:25] spirit which is of God, that we might
[1:17:27] know the things that are freely given to
[1:17:29] us of God, which things we also which
[1:17:33] things also we speak, not in the words
[1:17:35] which man's wisdom teacheth, but which
[1:17:37] the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing
[1:17:40] spiritual things, with spiritual. But
[1:17:43] the natural man receiveth not the things
[1:17:45] of the Spirit of God. For they are
[1:17:47] foolishness unto him, neither can he
[1:17:49] know them, because they are spiritually
[1:17:51] discerned. Yes.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul's telling in all my
[1:17:55] preaching and all that are teaching,
[1:17:56] we're comparing spiritual things with
[1:17:58] spiritual because that's what the Holy
[1:18:00] Ghost does. Compares spiritual things
[1:18:02] with spiritual so that the spiritual man
[1:18:04] by the divine interpretation of the
[1:18:06] spirit can catch the revelation of the
[1:18:08] word.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; But a natural man can't catch it.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; The natural the natural man receiveth
[1:18:16] not the things of the spirit of God.
[1:18:19] These things are spiritually given and
[1:18:21] only the spirit of God can quicken them
[1:18:23] to our understanding, can give us the
[1:18:24] revelation of them. The natural man
[1:18:27] can't get it. I say, "Thank you, God,
[1:18:30] for making me a babe
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; and God give me more of your spirit
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; and let the spirit be my teacher
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; because my natural man is not going to
[1:18:39] catch these things."
[1:18:42] And this out of the church age book here
[1:18:43] in the Smyrnan church age the prophet
[1:18:45] says he quotes Revelation 2:1. He that
[1:18:47] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:18:49] saith unto the churches. There is not
[1:18:51] one church age where this verse is not
[1:18:53] mentioned. Every single age has the same
[1:18:56] admonition to the people of every age.
[1:18:58] He that hath an ear, let him hear what
[1:19:00] the spirit saith. But it is absolutely
[1:19:03] impossible for all men to hear what the
[1:19:05] spirit says to the different ages.
[1:19:08] If you've heard what the spirit says in
[1:19:10] your age, praise God.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Because it is absolutely impossible for
[1:19:16] all men to hear what the spirit says.
[1:19:19] Somebody can play a tape, but it doesn't
[1:19:21] mean they heard what the spirit says.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Says, putting these verses together, he
[1:19:29] just went through several verses. We see
[1:19:32] that there's only one group of people
[1:19:33] and that a very special group of people
[1:19:35] who are able to hear what the spirit
[1:19:37] says in each age. It is one special
[1:19:40] group that receives the revelation for
[1:19:42] each age. That group is of God because
[1:19:44] the group that cannot hear is not of
[1:19:47] God. The group that can and does hear
[1:19:49] what the spirit is saying and receives
[1:19:51] the revelation thereof is that group
[1:19:53] described in 1 Corinthians 2:6-16.
[1:19:56] That's what we just read. They are the
[1:19:58] ones who have the spirit of God. They
[1:20:00] are the ones that are born of God. They
[1:20:01] are baptized into the body of the Lord
[1:20:03] Jesus Christ by his spirit. They are
[1:20:05] baptized with the Holy Ghost. Praise be
[1:20:08] to God.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; To further bring out what we have just
[1:20:12] said and to also use the scripture that
[1:20:15] should be born in mind as we talk about
[1:20:17] who it is that is baptized with the Holy
[1:20:19] Ghost. See what Jesus says in John 6:45.
[1:20:22] It is written in the prophets, and they
[1:20:23] shall all be taught of God. But turn to
[1:20:26] Isaiah 54:13. Whence this is taken and
[1:20:30] and it reads and all thy children shall
[1:20:32] be taught of the Lord. The all of God
[1:20:35] are the children of God. Thus it is that
[1:20:38] the evidence of being a true child of
[1:20:40] God. He whom the spirit has come upon
[1:20:42] and indwells is again set forth as one
[1:20:45] taught the word by the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Thou has hid this from the wise and
[1:20:50] prudent and has revealed it to babes.
[1:20:52] Who are the all that are taught of God?
[1:20:54] His children.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so glad I'm one of his
[1:20:58] children.
[1:21:01] Modern events, he says the Bible
[1:21:04] is to be revealed by inspiration. That's
[1:21:06] the only thing that the revelation Jesus
[1:21:09] told Peter upon this rock, this rock of
[1:21:12] revelation reveals who he is. Blessed
[1:21:14] art thou, Simon, son of Jonas. Flesh and
[1:21:17] blood has not revealed this to you, but
[1:21:18] my father which is in heaven has
[1:21:20] revealed this to you. Upon this rock,
[1:21:21] I'll build my church. not upon Peter,
[1:21:24] not upon himself, but upon the spiritual
[1:21:26] revelation of who he was.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; And he is the word.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; St. John 1, in the beginning was the
[1:21:33] word, and the word was with God, and the
[1:21:35] word was God, and the word was made
[1:21:37] flesh and dwelt among us. Hebrews 13:8,
[1:21:39] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:21:42] forever. How is he the same yesterday,
[1:21:44] today, today, forever? Because he is the
[1:21:45] word made manifest in every age.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's always been the word made
[1:21:51] manifest. He's always been Christ the
[1:21:52] anointed word. And he's Christ the
[1:21:54] anointed word in this age in the day
[1:21:56] when the son of man is being revealed.
[1:21:58] And the revealing of the son of man is
[1:22:00] attached to the coming of the son of
[1:22:02] man. And when we see and hear that
[1:22:04] prophet preaching and breaking down the
[1:22:06] word and doing what Peter did and taking
[1:22:08] all the scriptures and saying this day
[1:22:10] is the scripture fulfilled and this day
[1:22:12] is the scripture fulfilled and this day,
[1:22:14] amen, it has the same effect on us as it
[1:22:16] did on them. They were pricricked in
[1:22:18] their heart and they received Jesus
[1:22:19] Christ. Amen. AND HE SAID, "WHAT SHALL
[1:22:21] we do?" AND HERE WE ARE THAT DAY THAT
[1:22:23] THAT PETER WAS THERE and he caught a
[1:22:25] revelation from the father. He says,
[1:22:26] "Who am I? Who does everybody say? What
[1:22:28] do THEY SAY ABOUT THIS MESSAGE?" WELL,
[1:22:30] you know, Brother Brandon was a good man
[1:22:31] and he got off on the end and he had
[1:22:33] some good moral teaching that makes a
[1:22:34] good family. But who do you say this is?
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Who do you say that I am? AMEN. IS NOT
[1:22:41] just good teaching. It's just not a
[1:22:42] better way to live. AND IT'S NOT GOOD
[1:22:44] FOR A CHURCH AND GOOD FOR RAISING kids
[1:22:45] and all of THOSE OTHER THINGS. THIS is
[1:22:47] none other than Jesus Christ, the son of
[1:22:49] man, revealing himself to his bride. And
[1:22:52] when I look at that, I SAY, "THOU ART
[1:22:54] CHRIST. THOU ART MY HUSBAND THAT ARE
[1:22:56] JESUS CHRIST." AMEN. REVEALING YOURSELF
[1:22:58] to me.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Now, today and this hour
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; and things that are to be, he says, you
[1:23:12] see, the whole program, the whole church
[1:23:15] is built upon divine revelation. Jesus
[1:23:18] said in St. Matthew the 16th chapter,
[1:23:20] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[1:23:21] you, but my father which is in heaven
[1:23:23] has revealed this to you. What was it? A
[1:23:26] revelation of who he was.
[1:23:29] What was it? What was the revelation? He
[1:23:31] caught the revelation of who this really
[1:23:34] is.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; You're not just a man.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; You're more than a man.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; You're the anointed. You're You're the
[1:23:44] fulfillment of Genesis 3.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; You're the fulfillment of Isaiah 7.
[1:23:49] You're
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; the anointed. You're the Messiah. You're
[1:23:52] Christ, the son of the living God. By
[1:23:56] revelation, he recognized who this is.
[1:23:58] Flesh and blood didn't to him, but my
[1:24:00] father, what was it? Amen. It was the
[1:24:03] revelation of who Jesus is.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Let's read this again. Flesh and blood
[1:24:09] has not revealed this to you, but my
[1:24:10] father which is in heaven is revealed to
[1:24:12] you. What was it? The revelation of who
[1:24:14] he was. And upon this rock I'll build my
[1:24:17] church, and the gates of hell can't
[1:24:18] prevail against it. See, the revelation
[1:24:20] of Jesus Christ in this hour,
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; right? Not what he was in another hour.
[1:24:30] What he was what he was now. The Bible
[1:24:33] expresses it's growing in the bride to
[1:24:35] the full stature.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; What has he come to reveal to me today?
[1:24:40] What is the opening of the key today?
[1:24:42] What is it that brings me into this
[1:24:43] formula today? Amen. It's Jesus Christ
[1:24:46] revealed today.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Not what he was in another hour, but
[1:24:50] what he is now.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me to Luke chapter 7.
[1:25:09] Luke 7
[1:25:13] and verse 44
[1:25:19] says, "And he turned to the woman and he
[1:25:21] said,"Simon,
[1:25:22] seeest thou this woman I entered into
[1:25:25] thine house. Thou gavest me no water for
[1:25:27] my feet, but she hath washed my feet
[1:25:30] with tears, and wiped them with the
[1:25:31] hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no
[1:25:34] kiss, but this woman since the time I
[1:25:36] came in, hath not ceased to kiss my
[1:25:38] feet. My head with oil, thou did not
[1:25:41] anoint, but this woman hath anointed my
[1:25:43] feet with ointment. Wherefore I say unto
[1:25:45] thee, her sins, which are many, are
[1:25:49] forgiven. for she loved much, but to
[1:25:52] whom little is forgiven, the same loveth
[1:25:54] little.
[1:25:55] And he said unto her, "Thy sins are
[1:25:59] forgiven."
[1:26:01] And they that sat at meat with him began
[1:26:03] to say within themselves, who is this
[1:26:05] that forgiveth sins also? See that
[1:26:07] statement we just read? That's why
[1:26:09] brother Brenham said, "See another
[1:26:10] Pharisee."
[1:26:13] Because that was a Pharisees at the
[1:26:15] Pharisees at the table. And Simon was a
[1:26:16] Pharisees house. And when Jesus says,
[1:26:18] "Your sins are forgiven," the Pharisee
[1:26:20] says, "Who is this man that forgiveth
[1:26:21] sins?"
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Who is this? How dare you? That's the
[1:26:26] same thing that woman preacher did to
[1:26:27] brother Brandham.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; But brother Bam said, "You don't get
[1:26:30] it."
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a confessional booth.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; It wasn't me just declaring, "I want to
[1:26:35] forgive you." No, it was them receiving
[1:26:37] the spiritual revealed word.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; It was the spiritual revealed word that
[1:26:41] did it.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; And listen, who is this that forgiveth
[1:26:45] sins also? And he said to the woman,
[1:26:47] "Thy faith hath saved thee. Go in
[1:26:50] peace."
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; What saved her? What forgave her sins?
[1:26:56] What made her whole?
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Well, he says, "Well, she she washed my
[1:27:02] feet. You didn't wash them. She didn't.
[1:27:06] And you didn't kiss me. She did. And you
[1:27:09] never anointed me with oil." But she
[1:27:10] did.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know, when it comes down
[1:27:14] to it, Jesus doesn't say, "Because of
[1:27:16] your service to me,
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; you're saved."
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; She did all of that because she
[1:27:23] believed.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Simon didn't do all of that cuz he
[1:27:28] didn't believe.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; To one, a door was locked. To another, a
[1:27:32] door was open.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; It says her sins, which were many,
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; were all forgiven.
[1:27:45] She didn't ask forgiveness.
[1:27:48] No doubt it was in her heart. No doubt
[1:27:49] she was repentant. No doubt she was
[1:27:51] sorry.
[1:27:53] She didn't have to go to the temple. She
[1:27:55] didn't have to offer a turtle dove. She
[1:27:56] didn't have to give a lamb.
[1:28:00] What was it that saved her?
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Her faith.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; But her faith in what?
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; What was she believing in?
[1:28:11] the present tense word made manifest.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; It was the spiritually revealed word
[1:28:19] that did it. When she accepted Christ
[1:28:22] for who he was and she ran to him and
[1:28:25] gave all. Amen. Jesus looked down at
[1:28:28] her. Listen, it wasn't a works program.
[1:28:31] It wasn't the amount of effort she put
[1:28:33] in. It wasn't the work that she did. But
[1:28:35] Jesus recognized he who who is forgiven
[1:28:38] much love as much.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. What was she loving?
[1:28:43] It wasn't just a general love to
[1:28:44] everybody. She was loving the word.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; She was loving the word in person right
[1:28:49] in front of her. She was loving Jesus
[1:28:51] Christ, the son of God. And she ran and
[1:28:53] she did him a service that that Simon
[1:28:55] didn't want to do. And he looked at her
[1:28:57] and says, "Now listen, before she spoke
[1:29:00] anything to him, Amen. before he
[1:29:03] acknowledged anything, he says, "Your
[1:29:05] sins are forgiven."
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Your sins are This is why brother
[1:29:11] Brandham could forgive at marriage and
[1:29:13] divorce on the same basis.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Your sins are all which are many are all
[1:29:22] forgiven. Can you imagine how this woman
[1:29:24] felt? She knew her reputation. She knew
[1:29:26] what she was. She was trying to get out
[1:29:28] of it. She didn't like her lifestyle.
[1:29:29] She was ashamed and embarrassed and all
[1:29:31] the things that she had to go through.
[1:29:33] She didn't want any of it. Amen. But
[1:29:35] what she did was recognize that this is
[1:29:37] the Messiah in our midst. Jesus is
[1:29:39] Christ and nobody's serving him and
[1:29:40] nobody will. I will. And she runs and
[1:29:42] she throws herself at her feet and she
[1:29:44] pours herself out to him and he says,
[1:29:46] "You're forgiven." Amen. What did it?
[1:29:48] She received the word for her day and
[1:29:51] that word cleansed her from all
[1:29:52] unrighteousness and forgave her of her
[1:29:54] sins. And he says, "Your faith
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; has saved you."
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Faith in what? She wasn't in the temple.
[1:30:05] She wasn't bringing a lamb.
[1:30:07] What did she believe? She believed the
[1:30:10] present tense word,
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Messiah standing before her.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; There's a couple statements brother
[1:30:17] Brandon makes I just want to read now in
[1:30:18] light of this. Says, "And the Holy
[1:30:20] Spirit bears record of the predestinated
[1:30:22] gift that a church claims she has."
[1:30:25] What? By watering the word, punctuating
[1:30:27] in the word with an amen. When it said
[1:30:29] repent, be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:30:31] Christ. Amen. When it says these other
[1:30:33] things, amen. That's it. Amen to
[1:30:35] everything. See, it punctuates the word
[1:30:38] and God by predestinated the gift to
[1:30:40] come to remit sins. But it was given to
[1:30:43] the spiritfilled word body because the
[1:30:46] word can only forgive sins because the
[1:30:49] word is God.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; When that Pharisee says, "How can this
[1:30:53] being a man forgive sins?" They didn't
[1:30:54] realize it was the word that was
[1:30:56] forgiving sins. She was accepting the
[1:30:58] word and its fullness in her day and her
[1:31:00] acceptance of that word. She was
[1:31:02] FORGIVEN BASED ON THE WORD.
[1:31:06] It was her attitude towards the word
[1:31:09] because the word is God.
[1:31:11] How true the Pharisees was. I mentioned
[1:31:13] this morning. We'd get to this and I've
[1:31:15] took my time, but the Pharisees said,
[1:31:17] "This man forgives sins." We know he's a
[1:31:19] blasphemer. Only God can forgive sins.
[1:31:22] And this man is forgiving sins. Not
[1:31:24] knowing that he was the word. The word
[1:31:26] forgives sins because it's God.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love it. Friends,
[1:31:32] look. Christ in you makes him the center
[1:31:35] of the life of the revelation.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Christ life in you makes him the center
[1:31:40] of the revelation. Christ in the Bible
[1:31:42] makes the Bible the complete revelation
[1:31:44] of Christ. Christ in you makes you the
[1:31:46] complete revelation of the whole thing.
[1:31:48] See what God is trying to do. He's
[1:31:50] trying to get us to re he trying to
[1:31:52] reveal himself to us and reveal himself
[1:31:54] in us.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; He's trying to reveal himself in us to
[1:31:58] us.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:00] What is the new birth then? You said,
[1:32:02] "Well, brother Brandham, what is the new
[1:32:04] birth?" It's the revelation of Jesus
[1:32:06] Christ personally to you. Amen. See, not
[1:32:10] you joined a church, you shook a hand,
[1:32:12] you done something different, you said a
[1:32:14] creed, you promised to live by a code of
[1:32:16] rules, but Christ, the Bible, he is the
[1:32:19] word that was revealed to you. And no
[1:32:21] matter what anybody says, what takes
[1:32:23] place, it's Christ, the pastor, priest,
[1:32:25] whatever it might be, it's Christ in
[1:32:27] you. That's the revelation that the
[1:32:28] church is built upon.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; It's the revelation of the word for
[1:32:33] today. And that revelation of the word
[1:32:35] is coming into me. It's Christ in me.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he is the word.
[1:32:43] Back in the church age book, Brother Ben
[1:32:44] says, "Now
[1:32:46] we need revelation by the spirit. We
[1:32:49] don't need a new Bible. We don't need a
[1:32:51] new translation. though some are very
[1:32:54] good and I'm not against them. But we
[1:32:56] need the revelation of the spirit and
[1:32:59] thank God we can have what we need for
[1:33:01] God wants to reveal his word to us by
[1:33:03] his spirit. May God begin by his spirit
[1:33:06] to give us continuous lifegiving.
[1:33:10] Is it lifegiving
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; and prevailing revelation? Oh, if the
[1:33:15] church could only get a fresh revelation
[1:33:17] and become by it the living word
[1:33:20] manifested, we would do the greater
[1:33:22] works and glorify God our father in
[1:33:24] heaven. How many wants a fresh
[1:33:26] revelation? I want a fresh revelation. I
[1:33:28] want more revelation. I want God to make
[1:33:30] this word for this hour crystal clear to
[1:33:32] me. And then I can see God in all of his
[1:33:35] glory. And I can see where he's working
[1:33:36] and when he's working and who he's
[1:33:38] working in. And I can find him wanting
[1:33:40] to work in me.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:44] Oh, give us continuous lifegiving and
[1:33:48] prevailing revelation
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; because that's the foundation and the
[1:33:52] enemy cannot cannot that gave to me
[1:33:54] cannot prevail over that revelation.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Brother M says your first wedding was
[1:34:00] anulled. it was you never done it in the
[1:34:03] first place because there's only one
[1:34:04] thing could do it and that would be God
[1:34:06] come down himself and took your place in
[1:34:08] the form of son of God Jesus Christ and
[1:34:11] washed you by the water of the washing
[1:34:13] of the water by the word the word not
[1:34:17] the denomination the word washed you but
[1:34:20] if you won't stand in the water of the
[1:34:22] word how are you going to be washed
[1:34:24] you're still as spotted as Eve was
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; brother said it's the word that forgives
[1:34:29] because God is the word and Now, it's
[1:34:31] the word that's washing us from all of
[1:34:33] our sins. It's washing away all
[1:34:35] corruption and all pollution. Amen. This
[1:34:37] word has a washing power. This word has
[1:34:40] a it's a living word. And the living
[1:34:42] word, the purified living word is
[1:34:44] washing us clean.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; And we're standing under a fountain of
[1:34:48] purified word because we've got a
[1:34:50] PROPHET IN OUR DAY TO RESTORE to us the
[1:34:52] truths that were lost through the church
[1:34:54] ages. And we have the perfect
[1:34:55] interpretation of the word with divine
[1:34:57] vindication. Meaning it's not injected
[1:35:00] with man's ideas. If we get it from the
[1:35:02] prophet, we get it from the mind of God.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S A PURIFIED WATER. AMEN. AND I
[1:35:07] ASK YOU THIS QUESTION, HOW ARE YOU GOING
[1:35:10] TO GET CLEAN and dirty water? HOW CAN WE
[1:35:13] GO BACK TO THE DENOMINATIONS AND BACK to
[1:35:15] denominational ideas that's corrupted
[1:35:17] and polluted by the MINDS OF MAN? GOD
[1:35:19] GAVE US A PURIFYING WATER BY his own
[1:35:21] spirit AND BLOOD IN THIS HOUR TO WASH
[1:35:23] HIS BRIDE PERFECTLY CLEAN. AND YOU CAN'T
[1:35:26] get clean AND DIRTY WATER. YOU MUST COME
[1:35:29] TO this message to BE PURIFIED AND
[1:35:31] BROUGHT BACK TO A virgin condition.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Has to be this message. BUT THIS MESSAGE
[1:35:35] HAS THE POWER TO DO IT. FRIENDS, YOU
[1:35:37] DON'T HAVE THE POWER. IT'S THIS MESSAGE
[1:35:39] HAS THE POWER. IT'S THIS WORD THAT'S
[1:35:41] BEEN RESTORED. HAS THE POWER TO WASH US
[1:35:43] FROM ALL THE PROSTITUTE SPIRITS and
[1:35:46] bring us
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; into a virgin condition.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; To be united with Christ.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; It's the power of the word.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:56] How will we get clean and dirty water?
[1:36:00] How will you grow into the stature of a
[1:36:02] perfect man
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; with corrupt grain
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; with bad food?
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; It takes the food that was stored up.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; It takes the bread from heaven. It takes
[1:36:15] the mana himself to nourish us and grow
[1:36:18] us into the stature of a perfect man.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; And it takes the pure water of the word
[1:36:23] to wash us clean. Amen.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; And both have been given to us in this
[1:36:28] day.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; But God has to reveal it to us.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:36] The Lord tells us in Ephesians,
[1:36:38] "Husband, love your wife." He said,
[1:36:39] "Christ also loved the church and gave
[1:36:41] himself for it." That he might sanctify
[1:36:43] and cleanse it with the washing of water
[1:36:45] by the word. that he might present it to
[1:36:47] himself a glorious church, not having
[1:36:50] spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but
[1:36:53] that it should be holy and without
[1:36:55] blemish.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; You know what? He didn't say that we
[1:36:59] were going to be spot-ree and
[1:37:01] wrinkle-free and without blemish when we
[1:37:03] finally got our act together,
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; started a better works program.
[1:37:10] No, but he said he would wash us by the
[1:37:14] water of the word and he would bring us
[1:37:16] into this condition by purifying us by
[1:37:20] his word.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; The invisible union of the bride. It
[1:37:24] says, "What is sin?" Sin is unbelief.
[1:37:27] Unbelief in what? The word. Unbelief in
[1:37:31] God, which is the word. Pure,
[1:37:34] unadulterated. Oh, hallelujah. Leaving
[1:37:36] soon for the skies. Amen. Standing
[1:37:38] ready. thing. Your garments washed by
[1:37:40] the water of the bleeding word. The word
[1:37:43] became blood. The word bled for you. And
[1:37:45] you were washed in the bleeding word.
[1:37:48] Don't forget it was the word that was
[1:37:49] nailed to Calvary.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; It was the word that died for me. It was
[1:37:53] the word that bled for me.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; And now we're washed in the bleeding
[1:37:56] word. The word bleeding, the life of God
[1:37:58] in the word. And the word was bled for
[1:38:01] you. that you might be washed from the
[1:38:03] filth of these prostitutes and be
[1:38:04] cleaned and sanctified by the washing of
[1:38:07] the water of the word and makes your
[1:38:09] mind and heart stayed on God and on his
[1:38:12] word.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; I thank God for the hour we live in.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; I thank God for the open door, friends.
[1:38:18] I thank God that he sent a prophet and
[1:38:20] he restored his word and there's a clean
[1:38:22] water to get washed in.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a pure water that'll wash
[1:38:27] us by faith, by believing the word.
[1:38:29] Amen. by receiving Christ for our day.
[1:38:32] Amen. That will wash us from all of our
[1:38:34] sins and purify us and bring us into a
[1:38:36] union with him. So glad he's given us a
[1:38:39] word that'll bring us to the stature of
[1:38:41] the fullness of Christ because he's
[1:38:43] restored all the word in perfection.
[1:38:46] No more corrupt hybrid grain.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; We talked a couple a few serum
[1:38:53] quality.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; He brought us back to the original.
[1:38:58] And listen friends,
[1:39:01] this is the power to loose and bind.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; It's still available. It's still based
[1:39:07] on the word. It's still based on faith
[1:39:09] in Christ Jesus.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; It's still based on faith in the in the
[1:39:14] word for your day. It's still loosing us
[1:39:17] from our sins. It's still freeing us
[1:39:18] from our misunderstanding. It's still
[1:39:20] delivering us.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; And it's bringing us to Christ.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, God's called us to be
[1:39:27] kings and priests.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Kings and priests over a spiritual
[1:39:30] kingdom. Kings and priests. Amen. And
[1:39:33] and and we're over a spiritual kingdom,
[1:39:34] but we're walking in this earth as
[1:39:36] priests. Now, what are priests? Priests
[1:39:38] are intercessors.
[1:39:39] They intercede for the people. Amen.
[1:39:41] They stand in the gap and they intercede
[1:39:43] for the people. But a priest in order to
[1:39:45] offer his office, he's got to have blood
[1:39:47] of some kind to offer. Amen. And there's
[1:39:49] got to be an offering of blood. But
[1:39:51] we're priests, but we're priests after
[1:39:53] the order of Melzdc. Amen.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; And we don't have an order without
[1:39:57] blood. For he shed his blood and his
[1:40:00] blood is his life and he sent back his
[1:40:02] life and we're carrying his life around,
[1:40:04] friends.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT THE BLOOD. WE'VE GOT THE LIFE.
[1:40:07] WE'VE GOT THE WORD. WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT
[1:40:09] WHAT GOD SENT for this age. Amen. And
[1:40:12] what we can offer to people is not an
[1:40:14] idea. It's not a program. It's not a
[1:40:17] religious ceremony. It's not a church
[1:40:19] system. It's none of that. We're going
[1:40:21] to DELIVER TO THEM CHRIST JESUS THE
[1:40:23] WORD. AMEN.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; And they can receive the word.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; They can be washed. They can be
[1:40:30] sanctified. They can be purified. They
[1:40:32] can be united with the word.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; I say, God, thank you
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; for an open door.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you for a message. Thank you for
[1:40:41] something to give somebody,
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; something to share. I want to be like
[1:40:48] Peter, not running and hiding, but I
[1:40:50] want to stand there. This is the day.
[1:40:52] This is the prophecy. This is what he
[1:40:54] promised. This is the hour.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; If somebody could find their way to the
[1:40:59] feet of Christ in this hour, pour their
[1:41:02] heart out to him and receive the word
[1:41:04] for their day and find Christ Jesus
[1:41:07] alive today.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; They can weep at his feet and pour their
[1:41:11] life out to him. He can forgive them of
[1:41:14] all their sins.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Daniel seen a prophecy of the end time.
[1:41:22] And the Bible says in Daniel 12:9, he
[1:41:24] says, "And he said, 'Go thy way, Daniel,
[1:41:27] for the words are closed up and sealed
[1:41:28] till the time of the end, many shall be
[1:41:31] purified and made white and tried, but
[1:41:34] the wicked shall do wickedly, and none
[1:41:36] of the wicked shall understand, but the
[1:41:38] wise shall understand."
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; How is the wise going to understand?
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Because we got smarter.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; No, because we're the babes. Amen.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; That he saw fit to reveal it to.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; I say, "Thank you, Lord, for this
[1:41:58] message."
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for a clean water to
[1:42:02] stand underneath. Thank you for a pure
[1:42:05] word. Thank you for something to eat.
[1:42:07] Thank you for your life. Thank you for
[1:42:09] the truth. Thank you for everything
[1:42:11] you've given us in this day.
[1:42:14] And God, I don't want to just be
[1:42:15] thankful to myself, but I also want to
[1:42:17] recognize that there's still a gospel
[1:42:20] being preached. There's still an open
[1:42:21] door. And oh, I'd love for somebody else
[1:42:23] to find their way to the fountain.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; I'd love for God to strike somebody else
[1:42:28] with revelation. And they could say,
[1:42:30] "This is nothing but the truth. This is
[1:42:32] Christ."
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, God, keep the door open.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. There still can be a loosing.
[1:42:41] There can still be a binding. There
[1:42:43] still can be a rejection of truth and be
[1:42:45] a bind. But but I don't want to focus on
[1:42:47] that part. I want to focus on the
[1:42:49] loosing part. Someone can still be
[1:42:51] loosed and set free.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is the message that can
[1:42:55] loose us and set us free.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand together. Amen.
[1:43:00] That's what I had on my heart to share.
[1:43:03] We're walking around. You know what
[1:43:05] brother Brandham said? I I don't have
[1:43:08] the quote overhead, but I've got it
[1:43:09] here. I wasn't going to put it in my
[1:43:11] notes, but I just left it on my paper.
[1:43:14] Brother Banner said, "In Christ is the
[1:43:15] mystery of God revealed." He said, "The
[1:43:18] church is the blood of Christ by the
[1:43:20] spirit because the life is in the
[1:43:23] blood." That's the baptism of the Holy
[1:43:25] Ghost that baptizes into his body that
[1:43:27] recognizes only his body, his flesh, his
[1:43:30] word.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; His life is still in his bride. His life
[1:43:36] is still here. His word is still being
[1:43:38] made manifest. And I'm so thankful
[1:43:43] that God saw fit to let us be a carrier
[1:43:47] of the word.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Not because I was well educated and a
[1:43:53] theologian, I was maybe as bad off as
[1:43:56] Peter,
[1:43:57] but God didn't base it off those
[1:43:59] qualifications. God never was looking
[1:44:01] for that when he looked for me. He was
[1:44:03] looking for somebody who could receive
[1:44:05] the revelation of the word. He was
[1:44:07] looking for somebody who would hear the
[1:44:09] prophet preach and hear the message and
[1:44:10] get pricked in their heart and says,
[1:44:12] "That's the truth.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. To whom else shall we
[1:44:16] go? Thou alone have the words of eternal
[1:44:18] life."
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; I don't know where else TO GO. I DON'T
[1:44:20] KNOW WHERE ELSE TO TURN. I DON'T
[1:44:22] UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING, BUT I DON'T KNOW
[1:44:24] WHERE ELSE TO GO. THOU ALONE HAS THE
[1:44:26] WORDS OF ETERNAL LIFE. And I believe
[1:44:27] this message is Christ.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad, Amen, that Peter was given
[1:44:33] something he could share. He had a
[1:44:35] revelation of the word. And when he
[1:44:36] stood on the day of Pentecost, he had
[1:44:38] something to give. And that something he
[1:44:39] gave became a key, a revealing of a
[1:44:42] mystery that could open a door. And
[1:44:43] friends, we're here today. We're not
[1:44:45] left with nothing. We still have the
[1:44:47] revelation of the word that CAN BE AN
[1:44:48] OPEN DOOR to somebody.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; I say, God, give us wisdom to handle the
[1:44:53] word. Give us boldness to handle the
[1:44:54] word. Give us a life that will attract
[1:44:56] people. Amen. But let there still be a
[1:44:58] loosing that's taking place in this
[1:45:00] generation as someone comes to the
[1:45:02] truth.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; So glad, Amen. Amen. That there's still
[1:45:06] a life, there's still a power, there's
[1:45:08] still a blood, and it's still available.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just pray.
[1:45:16] Dear heavenly father, we thank you,
[1:45:18] Lord, for your word. God, it's more than
[1:45:20] we can even grasp sometimes. It's more
[1:45:22] of a reality than we even sometimes are
[1:45:24] aware in our human minds. It's our soul
[1:45:27] that's stirred. It's our heart that's on
[1:45:29] fire.
[1:45:31] But God, what you have provided in this
[1:45:33] day is so amazing to us, Lord. And the
[1:45:37] fact that you've given us a heart to
[1:45:38] believe
[1:45:40] that you in this day by your word,
[1:45:42] you've purified and you've made white
[1:45:44] and you've tried.
[1:45:46] Oh, but God, may your people come forth,
[1:45:49] tried by fire, but come forth as gold.
[1:45:53] God, you've provided the faith to
[1:45:55] believe. You provided the predestinated
[1:45:57] seed to believe with. And we're so
[1:45:59] grateful, Lord. We're eternally grateful
[1:46:01] for your grace and for your election.
[1:46:04] But God, if there's still life
[1:46:06] available, if there's still a word to
[1:46:08] preach and there's still voice in our
[1:46:10] lungs to preach it, God, may we preach
[1:46:12] like Paul and Peter and all the
[1:46:14] disciples and all the saints of old. May
[1:46:16] we preach this revelation of the end
[1:46:18] time message. And God, may it be an open
[1:46:20] door for somebody.
[1:46:23] May it be a path to you, Lord. May it be
[1:46:25] a way for them to be washed and clean
[1:46:27] and edified and brought into your very
[1:46:30] presence. And may your presence be
[1:46:32] brought into them. While we love you, we
[1:46:35] thank you so much for the day and hour
[1:46:37] we live in and for eyes to see and ears
[1:46:39] to hear. For only those, Lord, that you
[1:46:42] have ordained can see and can hear. And
[1:46:45] God, we find ourselves so grateful to
[1:46:47] you. God, I thank you that you weren't
[1:46:50] looking at my ability and you're not
[1:46:52] looking at my ability now, but you're
[1:46:54] looking at one thing. There's a seed
[1:46:57] that can receive my word. And God,
[1:46:59] that's by your grace. God, we love you.
[1:47:03] We ask, God, that you would use us to
[1:47:05] give this message out to all who would
[1:47:08] hear.
[1:47:09] May you direct us, Lord, each one of us
[1:47:11] in our own way, in our own life. Direct
[1:47:13] us, Lord, as lights in this world of
[1:47:16] darkness, as priests and kings, Lord,
[1:47:20] for you.
[1:47:22] May you direct us, Lord, to those that
[1:47:24] could hear the word. May you give us the
[1:47:26] right word in the right season, and the
[1:47:28] boldness that Peter had to proclaim the
[1:47:30] truth. When the time is right, when the
[1:47:32] season is right, when the conditions are
[1:47:35] right, may you move upon us. And God,
[1:47:38] may we see your children come to the
[1:47:40] light,
[1:47:42] your babes come to the revelation
[1:47:45] and be set free, to be loosed,
[1:47:49] to be open, have the door open to them.
[1:47:52] We love you. We thank you, God, for this
[1:47:54] revelation that we hold in our hearts.
[1:47:56] For we never went and grabbed it and got
[1:47:58] it and took it and bought it. We just
[1:48:01] received it. It was given to us by your
[1:48:04] grace. And God, it means so much to us.
[1:48:08] God, if I would have been there that
[1:48:10] day, that little harlot woman was
[1:48:14] running in and throwing herself at your
[1:48:16] feet to weep, wash your feet with her
[1:48:18] tears, and to wipe, Lord, all the scum
[1:48:22] off with her hair, to bear your reproach
[1:48:24] upon herself,
[1:48:26] to give all of her living, Lord, to pour
[1:48:28] out your feet. God, if I could been so
[1:48:31] lucky to be right beside of her, I would
[1:48:34] do it, Lord. It would be a privilege for
[1:48:37] me. But I didn't live in her day, Lord.
[1:48:40] I live in this day. And you've presented
[1:48:43] yourself, Lord, not in the same fashion
[1:48:45] as you did to her, but you prevented you
[1:48:47] presented yourself in this message to
[1:48:49] us. And may it have the same effect to
[1:48:52] me, Lord. May I weep at your feet, Lord.
[1:48:55] May I May may I bear your reproach upon
[1:48:58] myself. May I gladly serve you. May I
[1:49:01] gladly give you my best. May I give it
[1:49:03] all to you and weep of repentance and
[1:49:05] joy and gratitude just to be in your
[1:49:07] presence.
[1:49:10] Oh, and I I thank you for the
[1:49:12] opportunity you've given me now. I thank
[1:49:14] you for the chance I have today. I thank
[1:49:17] you for the voice I can proclaim your
[1:49:18] word. I thank you for the for the chance
[1:49:20] that I could stand for this message and
[1:49:22] stand for this word and give my all to
[1:49:24] it. I'm so thankful because he who's
[1:49:26] forgiven much loveth much. and I love
[1:49:28] you, Lord.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; God, help all of us, Lord, to take
[1:49:32] advantage of our day, of our
[1:49:34] opportunity, of our visitation.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; And may we, Lord, pour ourselves out to
[1:49:39] you and love you and embrace you and
[1:49:41] kiss you and anoint you and serve you.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; This is our chance. I love you, Father.
[1:49:48] I thank you for your forgiveness. I
[1:49:50] thank you for your washing of your word.
[1:49:52] I thank you for the purification that
[1:49:54] comes from your word that you've
[1:49:56] provided for us. Help us to stay under
[1:50:00] this word, Lord, and be washed
[1:50:02] completely clean. We love you. We ask
[1:50:05] that you would bless us as we go from
[1:50:06] here and anoint us for the work you've
[1:50:09] called us to in this last day. We ask
[1:50:12] for your blessings in Jesus Christ's
[1:50:14] name. Amen.
[1:50:16] And brother John,
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; give me more
[1:50:21] revelation.
[1:50:25] Let my flesh
[1:50:28] be all forsen.
[1:50:33] at the word
[1:50:35] of God. Guide me on my way
[1:50:41] so he can have preeminence
[1:50:45] each day.
[1:50:48] Give me more
[1:50:51] revelation.
[1:50:56] Oh, let my life
[1:50:59] be your
[1:51:01] reflection.
[1:51:04] For I know
[1:51:06] this word is my redemption.
[1:51:11] Give me more
[1:51:15] revelation.
[1:51:19] Give me more
[1:51:23] revelation.
[1:51:28] Let my flesh
[1:51:30] be all
[1:51:32] forsen.
[1:51:35] That the word
[1:51:38] of God guide me on
[1:51:42] my way
[1:51:44] so he can have preeminence
[1:51:48] each day.
[1:51:51] Give me more
[1:51:54] revelation.
[1:51:59] Let my life be your
[1:52:03] reflection.
[1:52:07] For I know
[1:52:09] this word is my redemption.
[1:52:14] Give me more
[1:52:18] revelation.
[1:52:21] Oh, give me more
[1:52:25] revelation
[1:52:30] and let my flesh
[1:52:33] be all
[1:52:34] forsen.
[1:52:38] and the word
[1:52:40] of God guide me on
[1:52:44] my way
[1:52:46] so he can have preeminence
[1:52:50] each day.
[1:52:53] Give me more
[1:52:56] revelation.
[1:53:01] Let my life
[1:53:04] be your
[1:53:06] reflection.
[1:53:09] For I know
[1:53:11] this word is my redemption.
[1:53:16] Give me more
[1:53:20] revelation.
[1:53:25] Come away. Thank you. Amen. There's a
[1:53:30] table dressed in linen.
[1:53:34] A banquet is prepared.
[1:53:38] Host of angels gathered
[1:53:42] for a celebration
[1:53:44] there.
[1:53:46] And the bride is almost ready
[1:53:51] in spotless wide array.
[1:53:55] A hush falls over heaven.
[1:53:59] My room begins to sing.
[1:54:05] Come away
[1:54:09] my love.
[1:54:13] Oh come away
[1:54:17] my love.
[1:54:22] I have waited for this day
[1:54:26] when I could give to you my name.
[1:54:31] Oh, eternity
[1:54:33] awaits us. Come away
[1:54:38] my love.
[1:54:42] I have loved you from creation
[1:54:46] long before you came to me.
[1:54:51] And I carried that love with me all the
[1:54:55] way to Calary.
[1:54:59] Though it wasn't over
[1:55:03] when they laid me in the tomb,
[1:55:08] I proved my love would never die. A rose
[1:55:13] again for you.
[1:55:17] Oh, come away.
[1:55:21] My love,
[1:55:26] come away.
[1:55:30] My love.
[1:55:34] I have waited for this day
[1:55:38] when I could give to you my name.
[1:55:43] Eternity
[1:55:45] awaits us. Come away.
[1:55:50] my love.
[1:55:54] And I have written my love secrets
[1:55:59] in a book you know so well.
[1:56:03] Oh, just look a little closer.
[1:56:07] You'll find victory over hell.
[1:56:11] And though in Satan's Eden
[1:56:15] and the world's in disarray,
[1:56:20] the oil and water I have reserved for
[1:56:24] you this day.
[1:56:29] Take us away,
[1:56:34] my Lord.
[1:56:37] Take us away,
[1:56:42] my Lord.
[1:56:46] We have waited for this day.
[1:56:51] We could take upon your name.
[1:56:55] Oh, eternity. He awaits us. Take us
[1:56:59] away,
[1:57:02] my Lord.
[1:57:06] Now the battle's raised in heaven
[1:57:10] and it's here on earth today.
[1:57:14] So overcome the wicked one and he'll
[1:57:19] carry you away.
[1:57:22] Oh stand upon my word of life. Rise
[1:57:28] above the storm.
[1:57:31] Be pure and clean in every way.
[1:57:35] Soon you'll fly away.
[1:57:40] Oh, fly away,
[1:57:45] my Lord.
[1:57:48] Oh, fly away,
[1:57:53] my love.
[1:57:57] Oh, I waited for this day
[1:58:01] when I could give to you my name
[1:58:06] and eternity
[1:58:08] awaits us. Come away,
[1:58:14] my Lord.
[1:58:17] Oh, take us away,
[1:58:22] my Lord.
[1:58:26] Take us away,
[1:58:30] my Lord.
[1:58:35] Oh, we have waited for this day.
[1:58:39] We take upon your name.
[1:58:44] Eternity
[1:58:45] awaits us. Take us away,
[1:58:51] my Lord,
[1:58:54] and be it unto me.
[1:58:59] According to your word,
[1:59:03] oh, according to your promises,
[1:59:08] I can stand secure.
[1:59:13] carve upon my heart
[1:59:16] the truth that sets me free
[1:59:21] according to your word. Oh Lord, be it
[1:59:27] unto me.
[1:59:31] Oh, be it unto me.
[1:59:36] According to your word
[1:59:40] according to your promises,
[1:59:45] I can stand secure.
[1:59:49] Carve upon my heart
[1:59:53] the truth that sets me free.
[1:59:58] according to your word, oh Lord, be it
[2:00:03] unto me.
[2:00:11] How can he desire
[2:00:15] to have fellowship
[2:00:17] with me?
[2:00:20] must be something more within that only
[2:00:26] he can see.
[2:00:29] And I pray, dear Lord, please take my
[2:00:33] life,
[2:00:35] give it all to thee.
[2:00:40] Oh, grant that every day
[2:00:46] that you'll commune with me.
[2:00:53] And on the road to Emma us,
[2:00:57] three men walked that day.
[2:01:01] And as they reach their destination,
[2:01:06] but to beg the third to stay.
[2:01:11] And as they talk together,
[2:01:15] breaking bread and pouring wine.
[2:01:20] Oh, I finally
[2:01:22] now realize
[2:01:24] the simplicity of this time.
[2:01:29] Oh, how can he desire
[2:01:33] to have fellowship
[2:01:36] with me?
[2:01:38] Oh, there must be something more within
[2:01:44] only
[2:01:45] can see.
[2:01:48] And I pray you, Lord, please take my
[2:01:52] life.
[2:01:53] Give it all to thee.
[2:01:59] and grant that every day
[2:02:04] that you'll commune with me.
[2:02:11] Did not our hearts burn within us as he
[2:02:16] talked to us by the way
[2:02:20] as he opened to us the scripture.
[2:02:25] The word revealed in us today.
[2:02:29] We can see the word in person.
[2:02:34] Oh, he's among us alive today.
[2:02:39] And he opened our understanding
[2:02:44] in simplicity
[2:02:45] Christ.
[2:02:48] And now I know that he desires
[2:02:53] to have fellowship
[2:02:56] with me.
[2:02:58] He reveals
[2:03:00] something more within. Until now I did
[2:03:05] not see.
[2:03:07] Oh, I pray dear Lord, please take my
[2:03:11] life. I give it all to me
[2:03:18] and grant it every day
[2:03:23] that you'll commune with me.
[2:03:28] And now I know that he desires
[2:03:33] to have fellowship
[2:03:35] with me. me. He revealed something more
[2:03:41] within until now I did not see.
[2:03:47] Pray, dear Lord, please take my life in
[2:03:52] me and I in thee.
[2:03:58] and grant that every day
[2:04:03] you'll commune with me.
[2:04:08] I've seen a vision
[2:04:12] harsh and sweet
[2:04:16] of one who gave all he had for me.
[2:04:24] I've seen the passion of his death
[2:04:31] and the forgiveness
[2:04:34] in his final breath.
[2:04:38] And now I can never be
[2:04:43] the same.
[2:04:46] My life has been
[2:04:49] forever
[2:04:52] changed.

[2:04:58] and give
[2:05:01] because
[2:05:02] he gave.

[2:05:24] now. I'm giving my life

[2:06:10] And no sacrifice
[2:06:13] is too much to make.
[2:06:18] No way to measure
[2:06:22] the cross
[2:06:26] next to the blood
[2:06:28] of Calary's
[2:06:31] cross.
[2:06:33] So if I live, oh, I live for him.
[2:06:41] And if I die,
[2:06:44] I count it gain.
[2:06:48] My life is not my own, but is from this
[2:06:56] day on.

[2:08:04] and no sacrifice
[2:08:08] too much to make.

[2:08:17] the cost
[2:08:20] next to the blood
[2:08:22] of Calary's
[2:08:25] cross.
[2:08:27] So if I live, I live for him.
[2:08:35] or if I die,
[2:08:38] I count it all gain.
[2:08:42] My life is not my own,
[2:08:47] but his from this day on.
[2:08:58] And I'm giving my life
