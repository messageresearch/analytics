[7:47] we ask your blessing over the word this
[7:49] evening in jesus christ's name we pray
[7:52] amen
[7:54] and while you're standing if you could
[7:55] turn with me to
[7:57] saint john the gospel of john chapter
[7:59] one we'll be getting ready reading from
[8:01] there
[8:02] i'd like to continue on with the same
[8:04] thought from sunday the seven seals
[8:07] opened the entire bible so this will be
[8:09] part two
[8:10] and uh uh there's a lot this keeps
[8:12] opening up and opening up and um so i
[8:15] don't know that we'll get it finished
[8:16] today but we'll just keep moving as we
[8:18] can also i wanted to announce that next
[8:21] wednesday a week from today uh brother
[8:24] samuel vollek will be here from poland
[8:26] brother samuel's brother yatzik's son so
[8:29] if you remember a couple years ago
[8:30] brother yatzik was here from poland and
[8:33] i've been out there to minister before
[8:35] and brother samuel is his son he's a
[8:36] minister in the church and he was
[8:38] my interpreter for the services there so
[8:40] we're looking forward to having him so
[8:42] be praying for that he'll be here next
[8:44] wednesday
[8:46] amen
[8:47] let's look at john chapter 1 verse 1.
[8:52] in the beginning was the word and the
[8:54] word was with god and the word was god
[8:58] and the same was in the beginning with
[9:00] god all things were made by him and
[9:02] without him was not anything made that
[9:05] was made
[9:06] in him was life and the life was the
[9:08] light of men
[9:09] and the light shineth in darkness and
[9:10] the darkness comprehended it not let's
[9:13] skip over to verse 10
[9:16] he was in the world and the world was
[9:18] made by him and the world knew him not
[9:21] let's go to verse 14
[9:23] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[9:25] among us and we beheld his glory the
[9:27] glory of the only begotten of the father
[9:29] full of grace and truth amen may the
[9:32] lord add us blessing to the word as
[9:33] we're seated
[9:35] we could bring up the powerpoint
[9:37] and we'll get started right away in that
[9:41] when we look at this
[9:43] saint john we went through this
[9:44] scripture sunday in the beginning was
[9:47] the word and the word was with god and
[9:48] the word was god amen as we go on these
[9:52] these scriptures keep meaning more and
[9:53] more and more
[9:55] to me as we look at this and god
[9:57] continues to unveil this and and we know
[10:00] that he was in the beginning with god
[10:02] and he was in the world verse 10 and the
[10:04] world was made by him and the world knew
[10:06] him not he came as a light and the world
[10:08] comprehended not who came because he
[10:10] came as the word and then that word was
[10:13] made flesh and dwelt among us so i want
[10:16] to look at that a little bit this
[10:18] evening
[10:19] in
[10:20] the quote souls lord in prison now this
[10:22] is a repeat from sunday but it says john
[10:25] looked around and he wept because there
[10:26] was no man even worthy to look on the
[10:29] book
[10:29] and especially
[10:31] to open the seals to reveal what the
[10:33] hidden mystery was
[10:34] the mysteries was in the seven seals
[10:36] when the seven seals was open that
[10:38] opened up the entire bible
[10:40] the seven seals it was sealed with seven
[10:42] mysteries and in those seven seals was
[10:45] held the entire mystery of it now this
[10:48] is interesting and
[10:50] this is where we got our text for sunday
[10:52] and for this the series that we're
[10:54] preaching when the seven seals was open
[10:56] that opened up the entire bible and
[10:59] what's interesting is that the opening
[11:00] of the seven seals when we look at the
[11:02] details of the opening of the seven
[11:04] seals when we had the interpretation of
[11:07] the symbols you we found out what a
[11:10] white horse rider was and what
[11:12] a red horse rider was and a black horse
[11:15] rider pale horse and souls under the
[11:17] altar in the sixth dimension or uh in
[11:20] the sixth seal i'm sorry and all of
[11:22] those things but but when he says when
[11:24] the seven seals was open that opened up
[11:26] the entire bible amen
[11:28] it didn't just reveal
[11:30] just the interpretation of the symbols
[11:33] but there was something else that was
[11:35] laying under all of that that it
[11:36] revealed and it revealed for us that
[11:38] christ was the entire bible he was all
[11:41] of it amen
[11:42] it was all christ and that's what we
[11:43] went into great detail
[11:45] sunday on and we'll look at this
[11:47] again
[11:49] but in the days of the voice of the
[11:50] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[11:52] sound the mystery of god should be
[11:54] finished as he had declared to his
[11:55] servants the prophets this is brother
[11:57] branham's ministry he's the seventh
[11:59] angel and he's here to finish the
[12:01] mystery of god and to reveal the mystery
[12:04] of god and so we know that he comes in
[12:06] july of 1963 and he preaches christ as
[12:09] the mystery of god revealed he said now
[12:11] for a text i want to take out of there
[12:13] this for a text basing it upon the
[12:15] entire bible
[12:17] now remember this
[12:19] when those seven seals opened it opened
[12:21] up the entire bible and now brother
[12:23] branham wants to take the text and base
[12:24] it on the entire bible so the seals open
[12:27] the entire bible amen
[12:30] now he wants to take a text basing it on
[12:32] the entire bible
[12:33] but i want us to title this christ
[12:36] is the mystery of god revealed
[12:39] christ being the mystery of god revealed
[12:42] so in the days of the voice of the
[12:43] seventh angel the mystery of god should
[12:45] be finished he comes and preaches a
[12:47] message called christ is the mystery of
[12:49] god revealed and he bases it upon the
[12:52] entire entire bible telling us that the
[12:54] opening of those seals opened up or
[12:56] unlocked the entire bible that's why
[12:58] brother branham after he preaches the
[13:00] seals he says my bible has become a new
[13:02] book
[13:03] it's a brand new book because there was
[13:06] something he says there was a mystery
[13:08] amen laying underneath of that a secret
[13:10] that was laying through the whole bible
[13:12] amen and that's what we're wanting to
[13:14] get to
[13:16] in christ is the mystery of god he says
[13:18] he has showed or revealed it in every
[13:21] type that's in the bible therefore the
[13:23] entire bible is the revelation of god's
[13:25] mystery in christ
[13:27] the entire bible is an expression of one
[13:30] goal that god had
[13:31] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[13:33] entire bible
[13:35] and all the acts of the believers in the
[13:36] bible has been in type and expressing
[13:38] what god's great goal is and now in this
[13:41] last day he has revealed it and shows it
[13:45] and god said well you'll see it right
[13:47] here this morning what the lord has had
[13:48] in his mind all along and has expressed
[13:51] it so what i want to what i want to stop
[13:53] and say so far these are all reviewed
[13:55] there's nothing new here this is review
[13:56] from sunday but when he says the entire
[13:59] bible is the revelation of god's mystery
[14:02] in christ the entire bible is expressing
[14:05] one goal all of a sudden our thinking
[14:07] completely changes now because we've
[14:09] been reading the bible but we haven't
[14:12] been seeing the bible
[14:14] because we've been reading the bible and
[14:16] reading stories and histories i'm not
[14:18] talking about us in the message but
[14:20] denominationally for generations we've
[14:22] been reading the bible and reading old
[14:24] testament and we're reading the book of
[14:26] isaiah and this is isaiah or this is has
[14:28] a this is ezekiel
[14:30] or this is uh genesis this is the story
[14:33] of them coming out of egypt it was the
[14:34] story of egypt it was the story of moses
[14:37] it was the story of noah and it was all
[14:39] these stories
[14:41] that were disjointed but laying there in
[14:44] the bible and we believed that they were
[14:46] all true but brother branham after he
[14:48] preaches the seals he says these are not
[14:50] individual stories or a collection of
[14:53] historical stories amen this is one
[14:56] story one goal one revelation one thing
[14:59] that god wanted to achieve
[15:01] and it changed our complete completely
[15:04] changed our thinking about the bible and
[15:06] completely changed our understanding of
[15:08] the scriptures now amen brother benham
[15:11] said makes the statement if you read the
[15:13] bible and don't see christ in every
[15:15] verse go back and read it again for you
[15:17] missed something because now the whole
[15:20] bible is about christ and christ is the
[15:22] revelation of god so the whole bible is
[15:25] the invisible god becoming known through
[15:29] the bible
[15:31] so it was god becoming known in noah god
[15:33] becoming known amen and abraham god
[15:35] becoming it was the thought of god that
[15:38] god had thought before the foundation of
[15:40] the world of how he was going to express
[15:42] himself and that thought amen was a word
[15:45] and that word moved into a manifestation
[15:48] and as that word was manifesting it
[15:50] wasn't a story about abraham it was
[15:53] about god
[15:55] it was christ the manifested a revealed
[15:58] word revealing god
[16:01] and so
[16:02] it really begins to change the bible
[16:06] from 66 books to one book
[16:10] from old and new testament to one story
[16:13] one goal one thing that he wanted to
[16:15] achieve
[16:17] and and what was that one thing he
[16:19] wanted to achieve to be known to be made
[16:21] manifest
[16:22] to be declared
[16:24] now
[16:25] in the message it is the rising of the
[16:27] sun says he is the one who opened those
[16:30] seals
[16:31] he is those seals for the whole word of
[16:34] god is christ and christ is the seals
[16:36] that was opened what is the opening of
[16:38] the seals then revealing christ
[16:41] so we talked about this if you remember
[16:43] i i showed the the picture of the cloud
[16:46] amen as it was there in arizona in 1963
[16:49] because brother benham told us that he
[16:51] shows it in the heavens above before he
[16:54] declares in the heavens before he does
[16:56] it on earth and what did he declare what
[16:58] he declared was the sign the sign showed
[17:01] what he was going to do what was the
[17:03] sign the sign was the headship coming
[17:05] down it was christ it was the head it
[17:07] was the full understanding or the full
[17:09] revelation or the full knowledge of god
[17:12] was coming down to unite with a body it
[17:14] was the revelation of jesus christ
[17:18] so that's what that's what was coming
[17:20] what what is the opening of those seals
[17:22] revealing christ
[17:24] still reviewing
[17:26] he says god's word comes only by the
[17:29] bible
[17:30] god's bible is the printed form of the
[17:32] son of god because the bible said that
[17:34] is the revelation of jesus christ
[17:37] it's god revealing himself through
[17:39] christ and christ is the word
[17:43] we can look back at the bible we look
[17:45] back at the old testament
[17:47] and when when the jews i i don't presume
[17:50] to understand what the jews understood
[17:52] when they wrote the bible 2000 when they
[17:53] read it 2000 years ago but they were
[17:55] reading you know in synagogue and
[17:57] reading coming up and being told of the
[17:59] story of the life of joseph and joseph
[18:01] was a hero to them in the former days
[18:04] one of the patriarchs that who saved you
[18:06] know a great part of the world and saved
[18:08] the the nation of israel but the story
[18:11] wasn't about joseph that story was about
[18:14] christ
[18:15] and it was about christ being rejected
[18:17] from his brethren amen being cast away i
[18:20] mean going to the prison house amen and
[18:23] bearing amen the iniquity of his uh the
[18:26] rejection and iniquity of his brothers
[18:28] and coming forth and raising rising to
[18:30] the right hand of power amen so that he
[18:32] can save all of his brethren that's what
[18:34] that story is about so when jesus christ
[18:37] came in the fulfillment of the story of
[18:40] joseph now he's coming and they're
[18:42] playing out exactly what they've been
[18:44] reading for thousands of years and
[18:46] they're rejecting their brother
[18:49] and they're casting him away amen so
[18:51] that he can raise up to the
[18:53] the the hand of right hand of power so
[18:56] that he can save them and they don't
[18:58] even know what their bible's about
[19:01] they know the bible baby like i said
[19:03] we've been reading the bible but we
[19:04] haven't been seeing the bible amen we
[19:07] read the story of joseph but we didn't
[19:09] see the story of joseph because the
[19:11] story of joseph was foreshadowing the
[19:13] ministry of jesus christ
[19:17] hopefully we'll come back to that
[19:21] amen
[19:22] who is this melchizedek
[19:24] notice now
[19:25] his attribute then the attribute was
[19:28] first god
[19:30] the thought the attribute itself all in
[19:32] one without being expressed
[19:35] then when he expressed secondarily he
[19:37] became then the word
[19:39] and then the word was made flesh and
[19:41] dwelt among us
[19:43] saint john the first chapter the first
[19:45] verse notice in the beginning but before
[19:47] the eternal notice the beginning was the
[19:49] word when the time began it was the word
[19:52] but before it was word it was attribute
[19:54] a thought
[19:55] then it was expressed in the beginning
[19:57] was the expression the word so he's
[20:00] showing us the the the i with the
[20:03] revealing of god first it was attribute
[20:05] it was thought
[20:07] then the thought when it come expressed
[20:09] was a word and then the word was made
[20:12] flesh and dwelt among us
[20:15] he says again who is this melchizedek
[20:17] now god in this stage it's this stage of
[20:21] his creation
[20:23] sorry this stage of his creation later
[20:25] formed into flesh jesus from what from
[20:28] the great beginning spirit then came
[20:30] down to be the word bringing itself out
[20:33] the word doesn't yet make itself it just
[20:36] spoke out and morphe later he becomes
[20:38] flesh jesus mortal to taste death for
[20:40] all of us sinners
[20:42] amen
[20:43] i'm going to oh i'm going to read this
[20:45] next scripture and then i want to go to
[20:47] the white board
[20:48] hebrews 1
[20:50] god who at sundry times and in diverse
[20:52] manners spake in time past unto the
[20:54] fathers by the prophets hath in these
[20:56] last days spoken to us by his son whom
[20:58] he hath pointed air of all things by
[21:01] whom also he made the worlds who being
[21:04] the brightness of his glory and the
[21:06] express image of his person and
[21:08] upholding all things by the word of his
[21:10] power when he had by himself purged our
[21:13] sins sat down on the right hand of the
[21:16] majesty on high
[21:18] so i'm going to try to draw this like i
[21:20] did the other day
[21:25] we talked about the thought
[21:29] remember brother branham said god dwelt
[21:31] alone with his thoughts
[21:33] he said he wasn't even god yet because
[21:35] god is an object of worship and there
[21:36] was nothing yet no thought yet had been
[21:39] expressed i mean there was nothing there
[21:40] to worship him
[21:42] and then there was an expression
[21:49] and then there was a manifestation
[21:56] and we used the example sunday of when
[21:58] god thought in in the creation of the
[22:01] earth
[22:02] or the recreation in genesis 1 2 he
[22:05] thought uh let there be light that was
[22:08] his thought amen but when he spoke let
[22:11] there be light that was this expression
[22:13] of the thought but then when the light
[22:15] appeared it was the manifestation of the
[22:18] thought a manifestation of the word
[22:20] which was a manifestation of the thought
[22:23] so there's a line of connection from the
[22:25] thought of god all the way to the
[22:27] manifestation now if god said let there
[22:29] be light and something else had manifest
[22:31] it wasn't his thought it wasn't the word
[22:33] something messed up in between
[22:36] but we know that
[22:39] help me lord to draw
[22:43] we got our little
[22:44] thought box here
[22:47] but then
[22:48] that thought of god brother brenham said
[22:50] then then out from the father came the
[22:53] son came the logos amen and he called it
[22:55] a pillar of fire or a light amen there
[22:58] was an expression there was something
[23:00] from god that came into an expression
[23:02] and and we'll just
[23:05] draw a
[23:06] pillar of fire i don't know if that's a
[23:08] pillar of fire
[23:09] but a light he said a little light came
[23:12] out and that was the logos and that was
[23:14] the sun what was it it was something
[23:16] that came from the father it was now
[23:18] god's thoughts now coming into an
[23:21] expression and he called that sign and
[23:23] that was the full thought of god that
[23:25] was the word logos means the word with
[23:28] the thought
[23:29] but then that thought
[23:31] was formed into a man
[23:36] right
[23:38] and that full word that full thought of
[23:40] god was formed into a man jesus christ
[23:43] the son of god amen and that had he was
[23:47] the expression of the full thought of
[23:49] god that had expressed as a word and
[23:51] that word come into manifestation so he
[23:54] was the perfect reflection of the
[23:56] thought of god of the invisible god when
[23:58] you wanted to see god you had to look at
[24:01] this expression and that expression was
[24:03] perfectly reflecting god making him god
[24:06] in flesh
[24:08] he was god in flesh because he was the
[24:10] thought perfectly expressed there was no
[24:13] perversion there was no corruption it
[24:15] was the perfect expression of the it was
[24:17] a perfect manifestation of the perfect
[24:20] word from the perfect thought making it
[24:23] equal to god
[24:26] but it was son
[24:27] that son was not father father was the
[24:30] thought what came out of the father was
[24:33] the son the son couldn't be the father
[24:37] right
[24:38] so we know this is not pentecostal
[24:40] oneness amen brother ben didn't teach us
[24:41] pentecostal oneness and the godhead but
[24:44] the father was the thought the
[24:45] originator originating everything and
[24:47] the expression that came forth from that
[24:49] that came out of him was a son that son
[24:52] was reflecting the the father the life
[24:54] of the father and it came into
[24:56] manifestation and when it came into
[24:58] manifestation amen he was perfectly
[25:00] reflecting the father he was the
[25:02] expressed image of the invisible god
[25:06] making him the manifestation of god
[25:14] so
[25:15] so
[25:20] let's just
[25:21] oh man
[25:23] let's just do this
[25:28] if you and i
[25:29] were part of that thinking of god from
[25:32] the beginning
[25:34] when god was thinking of manifesting
[25:37] himself he he already thought out the
[25:40] entire
[25:40] bible before he wrote before he had one
[25:43] prophet write one word he had thought
[25:45] out the entire bible
[25:48] and if you find yourself as an
[25:49] expression of that bible you have a part
[25:52] in that then you had a part in god you
[25:54] were in his thinking so so if you're
[25:57] here today amen and you believe that you
[26:01] that that you are part of god that you
[26:03] were in his thinking that you're here to
[26:05] manifest and express a thought god had
[26:07] of you before the foundation of the
[26:09] world that means you were here
[26:13] right there
[26:15] and when out when all the thoughts come
[26:17] into expression you were also here in
[26:20] the logos
[26:23] and if that's true then when that was
[26:24] moved in the flesh you were here too
[26:28] that's why brother branham said we don't
[26:29] have to die for us since he already made
[26:31] me die before my sins
[26:33] when i was with him at calvary amen we
[26:37] why because all of this
[26:40] moved into an expression
[26:43] all of that expression moved into a
[26:44] manifestation in flesh so if you were
[26:47] there you moved into the logos amen you
[26:50] have no conscious knowledge of that it
[26:52] wasn't you like you're standing here
[26:53] today but it was that part of god that
[26:56] wanted to express in you was in there
[26:58] moved into the logos you were there
[27:01] moved into the body of jesus christ was
[27:03] formed into flesh you were there
[27:08] so so what does that make the believer
[27:11] amen
[27:12] what does that make the believer amen
[27:14] you can't say i'm god like jesus and god
[27:17] were the same thing because it's a
[27:19] different portion it's a different
[27:21] volume he was the fullness you're a
[27:23] speck
[27:25] right
[27:26] but i'm happy to be a speck because a
[27:29] thought of god amen that was part of the
[27:31] logos is eternal amen that moved into a
[27:34] manifestation of flesh is eternal it's
[27:37] part of god it's an expression of god
[27:39] it's part of christ
[27:42] see these are some of the things that
[27:44] unlocked under the seals when our bible
[27:46] became a new book and we realized that
[27:49] the whole bible was christ it was christ
[27:51] and moses it was christ and noah it was
[27:53] christ and abraham why were they
[27:55] reflecting they were reflecting the
[27:56] thought of god expressing out in flesh
[27:59] being part of christ so when christ died
[28:01] on calvary he died for them
[28:05] but he also died for me
[28:07] because i'm another one of those
[28:09] thoughts to be expressed
[28:11] all right
[28:13] so when
[28:14] when this logos or word or thought
[28:19] it was here and out of that
[28:22] if we could just write down a timeline
[28:24] here
[28:25] of the old testament
[28:31] in every character in this old testament
[28:35] was noah
[28:36] or abraham
[28:40] moses
[28:42] joshua
[28:45] joseph
[28:48] whatever it was it was expressing part
[28:50] of that thought
[28:53] part of that was being expressed what
[28:55] was what was in here what was in here
[28:59] was now being expressed through here and
[29:01] coming into a manifestation through here
[29:05] but all of this
[29:07] was going to be wound up in the man on
[29:10] calvary
[29:12] all the fullness of the word was going
[29:15] to come into an expression amen that
[29:17] expression would be all the word that
[29:19] was bottled up
[29:20] old testament and new testament was
[29:23] there in calvary
[29:25] so
[29:26] brother is going to say i drew that
[29:28] picture because i want to see some
[29:29] things that brother brenham says as we
[29:31] go along here
[29:34] so he says that
[29:35] he who being in the brightness of his
[29:37] glory and the express image of his
[29:40] person that's why when when when jesus
[29:43] claims that god is his father then they
[29:46] know that he's claiming to be the son of
[29:47] god they take up stones to stone him
[29:49] because he he being a son of god makes
[29:52] himself equal to god
[29:54] well if you're a son or daughter of god
[29:57] where did you come from
[29:59] you didn't just decide to be a son or
[30:01] daughter of god you had to have an
[30:03] origin in the father as a thought and
[30:05] when that origin when that moved into
[30:07] logos you were there amen when it was
[30:09] here in flesh and jesus christ you were
[30:12] there and now that portion that was
[30:14] allotted for this time is in you amen
[30:16] expressing out now you're an expressed
[30:19] manifested son or daughter of god what
[30:22] does that make you amen it makes you
[30:24] part of god
[30:29] that's why i believe if the world ever
[30:31] really understood what we were saying
[30:32] they would take up stones to stone us
[30:35] if they really comprehended what we
[30:37] believed amen and what we were really
[30:39] saying because we literally believe that
[30:42] there is something that's inside of me
[30:44] now amen that's in my soul that was in
[30:46] god before the foundation of the world
[30:48] that was part of the father that he
[30:50] wanted to express and he was going to
[30:52] express it in this day as a son
[30:56] amen
[31:00] now in colossians chapter 1 verse 13 he
[31:02] says who hath delivered us from the
[31:04] power of darkness and hath translated us
[31:06] into the kingdom of his dear son
[31:09] in whom we have redemption through the
[31:10] blood even the forgiveness of sins who
[31:12] is the image of the invisible god the
[31:15] firstborn of every creature for by him
[31:18] were all things created that are in
[31:20] heaven and that are in earth visible and
[31:22] invisible listen
[31:24] just stop reading for a minute when i
[31:26] was a little boy amen when i was a
[31:28] little boy and i would read this
[31:30] scripture i envision jesus of nazareth
[31:34] standing there making everything in
[31:36] heaven
[31:38] and everything on earth
[31:40] do you understand what i'm saying
[31:42] as a little boy raising a denomination
[31:44] the only understanding i had of christ
[31:47] or the word or the logos was jesus of
[31:50] nazareth because that was the expression
[31:52] it was all in jesus of nazareth amen but
[31:54] before that body that flesh body was
[31:57] formed amen he was the logos amen he was
[31:59] the word and god made everything by the
[32:02] word
[32:04] by his word he made everything so by the
[32:08] sun he made everything in that sun moved
[32:11] in the flesh when he moved in the flesh
[32:13] he got the name of jesus amen and he was
[32:15] jesus christ but he was always christ
[32:20] so
[32:22] visible and invisible whether there be
[32:23] thrones or dominions or principalities
[32:25] or powers all things were created by him
[32:27] and for him and he is before all things
[32:30] and by him all things consist
[32:34] so the word came first and everything
[32:36] came from the word
[32:39] amen that's why for us the word is
[32:41] everything and the restoration back to
[32:43] the word is everything
[32:45] the the word being restored
[32:47] the word being restored to us is not for
[32:50] correct doctrine although it brings
[32:52] correct doctrine but the restoration of
[32:54] the word brings us back to the origin
[32:57] amen he is the word all things were made
[33:00] by the word all by the word all things
[33:03] consist
[33:05] so what did he fall from the word
[33:08] what's she being restored back to the
[33:10] word
[33:12] amen
[33:13] so i want to look at this verse 15
[33:16] that's in orange here who is the image
[33:18] of the invisible god the firstborn of
[33:20] every creature and i'd like to read that
[33:22] out of the emphatic diagram
[33:25] he said he is a likeness of the
[33:27] invisible god the firstborn of all
[33:30] creation
[33:32] so the the king james is the firstborn
[33:34] of every creature but really you could
[33:37] read it the firstborn the firstborn of
[33:41] all creation because the first thing to
[33:43] come forth from the father was the son
[33:47] was the logos and out of him came
[33:49] everything that's made in heaven and in
[33:51] earth
[33:54] all right let's keep going
[33:57] if anybody misinterprets christ
[34:00] jesus christ in the bible of not being
[34:02] god himself
[34:04] making him the second person or one god
[34:06] out of three this would upset every word
[34:08] in the entire bible
[34:10] it would break the first commandment and
[34:12] this is uh this is he's preaching
[34:14] against the trinity doctrine he's
[34:15] teaching the correct understanding it
[34:18] would break the first commandment thou
[34:19] shall not have any other gods before me
[34:21] all right it would make the whole
[34:22] christian race a bunch of pagan
[34:24] worshipers worshiping three different
[34:25] gods see what kind of a bible you'd have
[34:29] then it'd make us what did you say we
[34:31] are which one of them gods is your god
[34:33] see so you see you can't you mustn't
[34:36] misinterpret the bible
[34:38] jesus jesus himself is the
[34:40] interpretation of the bible
[34:42] when he's made manifest listen to this
[34:44] and when he's made manifest in the age
[34:47] that that part of his body is being made
[34:49] manifest
[34:52] if you want christ find where his
[34:55] manifested word where the manifested
[34:57] word is and you'll find christ
[35:00] jesus himself is the interpretation of
[35:02] the bible when he's made manifest in the
[35:04] age that that part of his body is being
[35:07] made manifest
[35:10] we go to john
[35:12] first john 1 7 but if we walk in the
[35:14] light as he is in the light we have
[35:17] fellowship one with another and the
[35:19] blood of jesus christ his son cleanses
[35:21] us from all sins
[35:24] this is a conditional statement
[35:27] if we walk in the light as he is in the
[35:29] light
[35:31] we know that he is the light
[35:34] and that light is the life of men
[35:37] so if we walk in the light as he is in
[35:39] the light because we must find where
[35:41] that portion of the word is made
[35:43] manifest for this age and that is christ
[35:46] and that is light and if we walk in that
[35:48] light and then the blood of jesus christ
[35:50] his son cleanses us from all sin
[35:57] i want to back up and look at this for
[35:59] just a minute i just want to make one
[36:00] comment
[36:02] if we walk in the light as he is in the
[36:03] light we have fellowship one with
[36:04] another and the blood of jesus christ
[36:06] his son cleanses us from all sins
[36:09] the blood of jesus christ is the price
[36:10] of redemption that erases all sin
[36:14] and it was the price that paid for
[36:17] abraham
[36:18] for moses for noah for joseph or joshua
[36:22] and erased all their sin
[36:25] so how
[36:26] when they didn't even know how to
[36:28] confess the blood and believe in calvary
[36:30] did they get the benefit of calvary amen
[36:33] they walked in the light as he was in
[36:35] the light
[36:38] so abraham was walking in the word for
[36:40] his day noah was walking in the word for
[36:43] his day which was the light
[36:45] moses was walking in the word for his
[36:47] day which was the light now that that
[36:50] was a portion of the word a portion of
[36:52] the word a portion of the word shows the
[36:55] same portion of the word that was in
[36:57] moses day being expressed was in jesus
[37:00] christ
[37:01] the same portion of the word that was in
[37:03] noah being expressed in noah's day was
[37:06] in jesus christ so the portion that they
[37:08] were believing and receiving was christ
[37:10] for their day now when christ was
[37:12] expressed in fullness now the word that
[37:14] they believed was the same word that
[37:16] bled for them that died for them he was
[37:18] the bleeding word amen
[37:21] so what did they believe in they
[37:22] believed in the word and that word
[37:24] atoned for them at calvary
[37:29] so you must walk in the light as he is
[37:31] in the light
[37:34] now christ is revealed in his own word
[37:36] god is revealed in every age by his
[37:39] promised word to that age
[37:43] all right the entire bible
[37:46] is the entire revelation of jesus christ
[37:49] making himself known to every age
[37:52] that's the whole bible
[37:54] what is the old testament jesus christ
[37:56] making himself known to that age
[37:59] what are the kings jesus christ making
[38:01] himself known to that age what it's the
[38:03] entire bible is jesus christ which is
[38:05] what
[38:06] the manifestation of the revelation of
[38:08] god
[38:11] and christ is the word the anointed word
[38:14] made manifest
[38:16] now
[38:17] this is important because the opening of
[38:19] the seals open up the entire bible what
[38:20] is the bible the bible is christ
[38:24] all right
[38:25] christ is the mystery of god revealed he
[38:27] says now notice
[38:28] that through the types we could take
[38:31] even david as spoke of a while ago going
[38:33] off his throne rejected by his own
[38:35] people going up the same mountain mount
[38:37] of olives as he he's going over to his
[38:39] prison he was going to his prison house
[38:41] because he was rejected of his brethren
[38:44] and of his own people he went up weeping
[38:46] that was the spirit of christ in him to
[38:48] be rejected as he looked over the
[38:49] jerusalem and wept said oh jerusalem how
[38:52] oft would i a rejected king
[38:55] 800 years later the son of david stood
[38:57] on jerusalem up there above jerusalem
[38:58] and rejected and wept over jerusalem and
[39:01] said now your hour has come that's right
[39:04] see
[39:06] all those things typed him just in time
[39:09] but yet the mystery was hid
[39:11] then men didn't know what they were
[39:12] doing they only knew that they were led
[39:14] by the spirit to do some now holding it
[39:17] back in the la in the last days for the
[39:20] great revelation but expressing it
[39:22] expressing himself in moses and david
[39:25] and joseph and elijah and on down
[39:27] through we could take each one of those
[39:29] prophets and bring their lives out and
[39:31] show it expressed jesus christ perfectly
[39:34] exactly yet never giving his secret and
[39:37] full
[39:38] waiting for to make it known in the last
[39:41] days as he promised waiting for it to be
[39:43] fully comprehended
[39:46] he was waiting for not to be in portion
[39:48] and portion and portion but he was
[39:49] waiting to wrap all the portion up
[39:51] together to let the word be fully
[39:53] comprehended then he would take the veil
[39:55] off of the whole thing and let us go
[39:56] back and see it was christ there christ
[39:59] here christ here christ here and it all
[40:01] matched
[40:03] waiting for to make known in the last
[40:05] days the promise waiting for it to be
[40:07] fully comprehended see before he could
[40:10] express it if he told the whole thing
[40:12] because the bible is written in
[40:14] mysteries jesus thanked the father for
[40:17] it and it was written in mysteries that
[40:20] it was written in mysteries
[40:23] in the unveiling of god he said oh
[40:24] brother sister are you catching it look
[40:26] don't you see it's been veiled through
[40:28] these ages according to what god said
[40:31] and it will be opened in the last days
[40:33] those seven seals would be broke and the
[40:36] full thing would come into view of the
[40:38] people what took place all along the
[40:40] hour of the seventh angel's message all
[40:42] the mysteries of god should be made
[40:44] known in that elijah this last hour how
[40:47] that christ was put out of his church
[40:49] the son of god how he's revealed a son
[40:51] of man again how that the church is to
[40:53] be put in order and everything for the
[40:55] last day no creed no denomination just
[40:57] absolutely the word living in the
[40:59] individual i'll take one and leave one
[41:01] i'll take this and leave that one see
[41:04] there's
[41:05] no strings no denominations no bindings
[41:08] or nothing it's the heart with god in
[41:09] him alone
[41:11] notice veiled in human flesh moses with
[41:14] that word speaking what was to be later
[41:16] put behind badger skins so so is christ
[41:20] our moses christ is our moses he was god
[41:23] veiled in human flesh veiled in humanity
[41:26] in flesh that's right and he's the same
[41:28] yesterday today and forever you catch
[41:30] that
[41:32] god was veiled in human flesh and he's
[41:34] the same yesterday today and forever
[41:38] don't forget that
[41:41] he was veiled by badger skins he was
[41:43] veiled in this time he was veiled in a
[41:45] man see now notice same yesterday today
[41:48] and forever promised his word to this
[41:50] age he is still christ the promised word
[41:53] to this age veiled in human flesh the
[41:56] word is god
[41:59] now
[42:00] brother branham was standing there
[42:02] just like john the baptist was standing
[42:05] the day that he was the forerunner to
[42:07] the
[42:08] first coming of jesus christ and he was
[42:10] standing there and they asked him are
[42:12] you him and he says no i'm the voice of
[42:14] one crying in the wilderness what did he
[42:16] say i am the manifestation of the word
[42:20] and when he said i am the manifestation
[42:22] of the word he was an expression of
[42:24] christ pointing to the expression of
[42:26] christ
[42:27] and here's brother branham fulfilling
[42:30] malachi 4 revelations uh 17 30. he's
[42:34] feeling he's fulfilling all of these
[42:36] scriptures and he's he's standing here
[42:39] amen and what was he amen he was malachi
[42:42] 4 he was revelations 10 7 he was all of
[42:45] these scriptures what was he he was
[42:47] christ veiled in flesh
[42:50] and he said in the word in this age
[42:53] he's still christ the promised word to
[42:55] this age veiled in human flesh the word
[42:58] is god
[42:59] the anointing is a person the word
[43:01] christ means anointed one the anointed
[43:03] one then moses was christ in his days
[43:07] so who was christ who was moses christ
[43:12] is that true
[43:13] who was noah christ
[43:16] who was brother branham christ
[43:20] now don't make a mistake i'm we're not
[43:22] saying he was the full expression of
[43:24] jesus christ but he was a portion
[43:27] moses wasn't the full expression of
[43:29] christ he was a portion jesus christ was
[43:32] the full expression of christ the word
[43:34] right
[43:36] and so it was still christ but christ in
[43:39] a portion one portion of christ be made
[43:42] manifest in that day one portion of
[43:44] christ be made manifest in this day
[43:46] until it come down to jesus christ
[43:48] himself was all portions made manifest
[43:50] in his day
[43:54] but christ
[43:56] is the revelation of god he's the word
[43:58] the anointed word for that age
[44:01] that's christ
[44:04] moses was christ in his days
[44:06] he was the anointed one
[44:08] jeremiah was christ in his days with a
[44:11] portion of the word for that day
[44:13] but when jesus come he come as the
[44:15] redeemer anointed one and that was both
[44:17] moses and all that was in moses and all
[44:20] the word and all the godhead bodily was
[44:22] in him that's the reason the whole
[44:24] temple veil ran and the mercy seat come
[44:26] in perfect view he was the anointed one
[44:28] notice now the veil in human flesh the
[44:31] promised word to this age must also be
[44:35] veiled
[44:36] notice sin-loving church members and
[44:38] sinners cannot see it because
[44:41] of the human veil
[44:43] so the revelation at the end time
[44:46] the revelation at the end of the church
[44:48] ages must also be veiled
[44:51] and it's veiled in human flesh
[44:55] we saw that in the prophet of god
[44:58] but it didn't stop with the prophet of
[45:00] god
[45:02] in the unveiling of god he says notice
[45:05] notice the title the unveiling of god
[45:09] notice then we then we become part of
[45:12] him as you are the veil that veils him
[45:15] you are part of him as long as christ is
[45:18] in you
[45:18] as christ was of god because god was in
[45:21] him made him god and as christ is in you
[45:24] the hope of glory you become part of
[45:26] christ
[45:27] he that believeth on me the works that i
[45:29] do shall he also see you become part of
[45:31] christ as long as christ is hid in you
[45:34] then it's veiled to the unbeliever but
[45:37] you know he's in you you are templing
[45:40] christ
[45:41] that's behind the veil the skin
[45:44] we be behind because of this veil the
[45:47] veil again in human flesh hides god the
[45:50] word from the unbeliever
[45:53] that's the day that we're living in now
[45:55] that's the manifestation in his bride
[45:58] christ is in his bride the word amen is
[46:01] in his bride behind the veil of flesh
[46:03] and the veil is hiding him from the
[46:05] unbeliever but you the believer you know
[46:07] he's there you know you're behind the
[46:09] veil with him
[46:12] and what is it you're templing christ
[46:15] amen that's why the the the revelation
[46:18] of the seven seals took the veil off of
[46:20] this and we begin to understand who
[46:22] christ is and how christ is manifest and
[46:25] we don't put it somewhere far off back
[46:27] amen but christ is here today
[46:30] christ is here moving amen christ is
[46:33] here manifesting the word is being made
[46:35] manifest in this day but it's in another
[46:38] veil it's hid behind skins behind the
[46:41] veil hiding him from the unbeliever amen
[46:43] but you know he's there
[46:46] you're temple in christ
[46:48] amen that makes the opening of the seals
[46:52] the peeling back of the mystery
[46:55] it makes it more than just details and
[46:58] interpretations
[47:00] it makes it a living reality in our day
[47:03] it makes it a living christ manifesting
[47:06] himself in another form
[47:13] he goes on you're tempting christ don't
[47:15] read this again you're tempting christ
[47:17] that's behind the veil of the skin
[47:19] behind because of this veil the veil
[47:21] again in human flesh hides god the word
[47:23] from the unbeliever
[47:25] that is writ as it is written
[47:27] written you are written epistles the
[47:29] bible said what is epistle is a written
[47:32] word and you are the written word other
[47:34] words you read it like this it says you
[47:37] are written epistles or you are the word
[47:39] that has been written
[47:41] made manifest
[47:42] nothing can be added to it
[47:48] message paradox he says god
[47:50] condescending
[47:52] from pillar of fire
[47:54] down to be made man
[47:56] and then the holy spirit right in us
[47:59] don't you see what it is
[48:00] the same god coming down all the time
[48:04] i want you to let's read that statement
[48:06] again carefully
[48:08] god condescending who's condescending
[48:12] god
[48:13] from pillar fire down to be made man
[48:16] that's in jesus christ
[48:17] and then the holy spirit right in us
[48:21] don't you see what it is
[48:23] the same god coming down all the time
[48:27] what is god manifest in flesh it's god
[48:30] coming down it's god condescending
[48:33] god above us god with us
[48:36] god in us
[48:37] see like the thought of god the word of
[48:40] god and the manifestation of the word
[48:43] he goes in those three orders again the
[48:45] thought of god the word of god and the
[48:48] manifestation of the word that's what
[48:50] we've been called to be in this day
[48:54] the message who is this melchizedek he
[48:56] says now
[48:57] in the beginning god dwelt alone
[49:00] with his attributes as i spoke this
[49:01] morning that's his thoughts there was
[49:03] nothing just god alone but he had
[49:06] thoughts
[49:07] just like a great architect can set down
[49:09] in his mind and draw out what he thinks
[49:11] he's going to build create now he cannot
[49:14] create he can take something that's been
[49:16] created and make it a different form
[49:18] because god is the only
[49:20] is the only only one can create but he
[49:22] gets in his mind what he's going to do
[49:24] and that's his thoughts that's his
[49:25] desires now it's a thought and then he
[49:28] speaks it and it's a word then
[49:32] a thought when it's expressed is a word
[49:34] a thought expressed is a word but it has
[49:36] to be a thought first so it's god's
[49:38] attributes then it becomes a thought
[49:40] then a word notice
[49:42] those who have tonight eternal life was
[49:45] with him and in him in his thinking
[49:47] before there was ever an angel star
[49:49] cherubim or anything else that's eternal
[49:51] and if you have eternal life you always
[49:53] was
[49:55] i say that quote applies to me
[49:58] by faith does it apply to you
[50:01] now
[50:02] now let's keep going
[50:04] now notice
[50:06] how few recognize him to be the anointed
[50:08] word of the day
[50:10] see god in the beginning being infinite
[50:12] and knowing all things from the
[50:13] beginning
[50:14] and the only thing that these things are
[50:16] is the display of his attributes and you
[50:19] have an attribute it's your thought you
[50:20] think of something then you speak it
[50:22] then you take it that's god
[50:24] that's the same way god manifest himself
[50:26] he thought then he spoke and then he
[50:29] manifested that's god he in the
[50:32] beginning if you ever was or ever will
[50:34] be in heaven you was in heaven to start
[50:37] with
[50:39] i love that statement
[50:40] if you ever was or ever will be in
[50:42] heaven you was in heaven to start with
[50:44] so there's no way for the believer to
[50:46] say i hope i make it to heaven there is
[50:48] no hope about it friends if you started
[50:50] there you're going back there amen you
[50:52] had to begin there to have a guarantee
[50:54] to go back there
[50:57] so then why did you come down amen if
[51:00] you started there's this thought why is
[51:02] god's thought in you now even you're
[51:05] here to be a manifested thought and
[51:07] expressed thought of god to manifest the
[51:10] whatever god thought he wanted to
[51:12] portray on the earth in your vessel in
[51:15] this day was in his thinking before the
[51:17] foundation of the world and you're here
[51:19] to do that
[51:21] you were here to express whatever that
[51:22] was you wanted to express and when you
[51:24] expressed that that is christ
[51:28] that is christ being expressed in your
[51:30] neighborhood that is christ being
[51:32] expressed in your workplace that is
[51:34] christ being expressed in your family
[51:36] that is christ being expressed that
[51:39] thought of god coming down into
[51:41] manifestation and manifesting itself out
[51:43] through a vessel is a manifestation of
[51:46] christ
[51:47] that's what we come here for
[51:52] if you ever was ever ever will be in
[51:54] heaven you was in heaven to start with
[51:57] you're
[51:58] part of god
[52:00] you were his thought he knew your name
[52:03] he knew who you were before there was
[52:04] ever a molecule before there was a light
[52:06] before there was anything he knew you
[52:09] and your name and put it on the lamb's
[52:11] book of life before the world was ever
[52:12] formed see
[52:14] you were his thought and then you become
[52:17] a word
[52:18] and a word is a thought expressed then
[52:20] you are manifested
[52:22] that's the way he was he was in the
[52:24] beginning by himself god dwelt alone
[52:26] with his thoughts he'll never do that
[52:28] again
[52:31] because his thoughts are being made
[52:32] manifest
[52:34] there was a time god was alone with his
[52:36] thoughts but that's not the day we live
[52:38] in he'll never do that again because
[52:40] those thoughts are being made manifest
[52:42] and that's why we are right here this
[52:45] day is god fellowshipping with his
[52:47] thoughts being made manifest
[52:50] when you're listening to the message you
[52:52] think well i'm listening to a message no
[52:54] god is manifest god is fellowshipping
[52:57] with his thoughts amen you're having
[52:59] fellowship with his gut with god when
[53:01] you fellowship around the word made
[53:03] manifest in this day
[53:05] god will never dwell alone with his
[53:08] thoughts again
[53:10] he will dwell with his thoughts
[53:13] but after they've been made manifest
[53:16] and expressed
[53:21] there is your name on the book of life
[53:24] the book of life is the word of god
[53:26] because the word is god and god is the
[53:28] only thing that is life so your name was
[53:31] represented in the bible before the
[53:33] bible became onward
[53:38] and if you're here to do that won't it
[53:40] vindicate that word
[53:44] so your name was represented in the
[53:46] bible before the bible became one word
[53:50] because that is an expression of god's
[53:52] thoughts
[53:53] the bible was written in his mind before
[53:55] the foundation of the world you were
[53:56] there
[53:58] the book of life was written all the
[53:59] names were put in what what is that the
[54:02] book of life the book of life is the
[54:03] word of god amen it's all god's thoughts
[54:06] amen that would become word amen that
[54:08] become manifested word that was the book
[54:10] of life you were there you were secure
[54:13] you were part of that and he's been
[54:15] moving down to express that this is the
[54:17] condescending of god
[54:20] when we
[54:21] i'll go back here
[54:29] so when we have
[54:30] the thought
[54:36] and then the expression
[54:40] and then the manifestation
[54:46] god wanted his thoughts to be made
[54:48] manifest
[54:49] he wanted to come all the way down to
[54:51] here
[54:54] if you're the manifestation if you're
[54:56] part of this manifestation and i'm going
[54:58] to draw a tiny little speck
[55:01] because you and i can be a little speck
[55:03] of the manifestation of god
[55:06] that means if you're a little speck of
[55:07] the manifestation you were a little
[55:09] speck of a thought here
[55:12] and you're a little speck of the
[55:13] expression here
[55:15] and this is all god wanting to come down
[55:18] and having fellowship with his thoughts
[55:21] with his attributes
[55:23] now
[55:24] here's the part that gets complicated
[55:27] because when we're down here
[55:29] living in this life and fallen flesh
[55:32] amen in a fallen world
[55:34] amen we come in contact with all kinds
[55:36] of difficulties and trials and
[55:38] tribulations and
[55:39] and all of this amen that will uh
[55:42] try to set us back and satan uses all
[55:44] these things to try to derail us from
[55:46] our purpose and we have questions and we
[55:48] have doubts and we have all of this but
[55:50] the opening of the seals the message of
[55:52] the hour came to peel all the confusion
[55:53] away and take us all the way back to the
[55:56] thought so that when you're traveling
[55:58] down in this life amen and all of a
[56:00] sudden you come across an obstacle amen
[56:02] we're not wondering i wonder if i'll
[56:04] make it to heaven i hope i get there but
[56:05] you've had a prophet say you started in
[56:08] heaven you're going back to heaven this
[56:10] thing is not going to derail you
[56:13] amen you were part of the word you're
[56:15] written in the bible you were in the
[56:17] bible before the bible became onward
[56:21] and you could say i can find myself in
[56:22] the bible brother ted where do you find
[56:24] yourself in the bible he'll have a bride
[56:26] without spot or wrinkle there i am
[56:29] in revelations amen the bride has made
[56:31] herself ready that's what i'm doing now
[56:33] putting on the garment of the word
[56:35] putting on the word i'm making myself
[56:36] ready i'm in that word that word is me
[56:39] i'm expressing that word
[56:41] revelation 22 say the spirit and the
[56:43] bright say come i'm saying come
[56:47] so before
[56:49] listen before it was written here i mean
[56:52] i was part of it when it was in the mind
[56:54] of god amen when god put it on writing
[56:57] when he wrote that when he had them pin
[56:59] that scripture you and i were part of
[57:02] that thinking when the scripture was
[57:04] penned the spirit and the bride say come
[57:08] so if we were in his thinking before it
[57:11] was written 2 000 years ago amen and now
[57:14] for 2 000 years it's been declared and
[57:16] now it's becoming manifest who can stand
[57:19] against you what will stop you what will
[57:21] derail you what sickness will take you
[57:23] off the scene what's going to happen to
[57:26] an expressed thought of god until it's
[57:28] finished serving its purpose
[57:31] you can see how the opening of the seals
[57:33] peeling back the entire mystery of the
[57:35] word and revealing christ takes away so
[57:38] much fear amen so much doubt and so much
[57:42] manipulation from the devil from things
[57:44] that happened to us
[57:46] if we could just receive what the
[57:48] prophet of god has told us
[57:51] and believe
[57:52] it we can believe it today but it's hard
[57:56] to believe it whenever your world comes
[57:58] crashing down tomorrow
[58:01] but when the world comes crashing down
[58:02] tomorrow we have to remember
[58:05] that god put me here to express his
[58:08] thoughts
[58:10] and nothing's going to happen to me
[58:12] that'll stop that expression of this
[58:14] thought so this tragedy that i'm in
[58:18] has only come so god could express his
[58:20] thoughts
[58:24] see there's overcoming power in
[58:26] revelation
[58:28] we could
[58:30] we could preach and preach and preach
[58:33] and preach
[58:34] uh
[58:36] i don't know
[58:37] trying to get you to have faith to reach
[58:40] out for the promise and believe that god
[58:42] will heal you
[58:43] it's a promise in the bible try to have
[58:45] faith try to reach out try to have faith
[58:48] but when god sent the message and peeled
[58:49] back the mystery and said you were in
[58:51] him before the foundation of the world
[58:52] and you're only here to express him i'm
[58:54] telling you when you catch the
[58:55] revelation of that you're not trying to
[58:57] have faith you're understanding that god
[58:59] is a healer and he will heal me because
[59:01] i'm here for him
[59:04] and no more trying to encourage and
[59:06] trying to push and trying to get the
[59:08] people to have faith amen the message
[59:10] came to unlock the mystery so you could
[59:13] find yourself in the mystery and then
[59:15] all of a sudden the revelation is faith
[59:19] say will he heal me of course he'll heal
[59:21] me i'm here for him
[59:23] i'm expressing him there's something in
[59:25] my life he wants to express he wants to
[59:27] express a part of his nature a part of
[59:29] his word amen of course you'll heal me
[59:34] amen goes on to saying who is this milk
[59:37] is it
[59:38] now we find him at the beginning his
[59:40] attributes and now you were with him
[59:42] then
[59:43] then is when the book of life comes into
[59:45] view
[59:47] see god in the beginning when he thought
[59:49] of you and thought of others like that
[59:51] thought of himself
[59:53] of being tangible
[59:57] think about that again
[59:59] god in the beginning when he thought of
[1:00:00] you and thought of others like that
[1:00:03] thought of himself being tangible
[1:00:06] what was god thinking he was thinking of
[1:00:08] himself
[1:00:09] being tangible
[1:00:11] that was his thoughts
[1:00:16] the unveiling of god
[1:00:19] like the attribute see it is god it is
[1:00:22] in god an attribute is your thought
[1:00:24] god in the beginning the eternal he
[1:00:26] wasn't even a god
[1:00:27] he was the eternal he wasn't even god
[1:00:29] god is an object of worship or something
[1:00:31] see
[1:00:32] so he wasn't even that he was elohim the
[1:00:34] eternal but in him was thoughts he
[1:00:37] wanted to become material
[1:00:39] and what did he do then he spoke a word
[1:00:42] and the word was materialized that's the
[1:00:44] whole picture from genesis to
[1:00:46] revelations there's nothing wrong
[1:00:48] it's elohim materializing so he can be
[1:00:51] touched
[1:00:52] feel
[1:00:53] and in the millennium there is elohim
[1:00:56] sitting on the throne see that's right
[1:00:58] with all of his subjects around him that
[1:01:00] he predestinated before the foundation
[1:01:02] of the world
[1:01:04] so now what is your bible
[1:01:08] is it 66 books
[1:01:10] is it a story about joseph a story about
[1:01:13] moses story about the history of the
[1:01:15] jews and story about this
[1:01:17] no
[1:01:18] it's god
[1:01:20] elohim
[1:01:21] materializing
[1:01:23] he was materializing in moses he was
[1:01:25] materializing and no he was
[1:01:27] materializing all the way down so he can
[1:01:30] be touched
[1:01:31] and feel
[1:01:33] god wanted to fellowship with his
[1:01:36] attributes
[1:01:40] would you deny what jesus said himself
[1:01:43] what the bible itself speaks out which
[1:01:46] is christ's anointed word
[1:01:48] and if the word abides in you then your
[1:01:51] anointed person with the word
[1:01:53] ye abide in me and my word in you then
[1:01:55] ask what you will it'll be done for you
[1:01:57] that's christ in you anointing the word
[1:01:59] for this age
[1:02:01] whatever age they lived in god divided
[1:02:03] his word to the ages
[1:02:06] that's what we're here for
[1:02:09] when the seals opened up the entire
[1:02:11] bible it revealed christ
[1:02:14] when christ was revealed
[1:02:16] you and i were revealed
[1:02:19] it was more
[1:02:21] than just tying together all the loose
[1:02:23] ends although that was important all
[1:02:25] that had to come together and the
[1:02:27] opening of the seals had to come to
[1:02:28] reveal the coming of christ because
[1:02:30] jesus was the only one who could open
[1:02:32] those seals
[1:02:33] but he peeled back the mystery and
[1:02:35] brother brown's bible became a new book
[1:02:37] because when christ was revealed you and
[1:02:39] i were revealed with him
[1:02:42] and it's now not about churches and not
[1:02:44] about denominations and not about this
[1:02:46] and not about that now it's all about
[1:02:49] him materializing himself upon the earth
[1:02:52] finishing his plan of redemption so that
[1:02:54] he can be known so that he can be
[1:02:56] expressed
[1:02:57] and returning back to where we came from
[1:03:02] i want to read just
[1:03:04] two more scriptures
[1:03:06] my little children of whom my travailing
[1:03:08] birth again until christ
[1:03:10] be formed
[1:03:11] in you
[1:03:13] second one even the mystery which has
[1:03:15] been hid from ages and from generations
[1:03:18] but now is made manifest to his saints
[1:03:21] to whom god would make known what is the
[1:03:22] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:03:24] among the gentiles which is christ in
[1:03:27] you
[1:03:27] the hope of glory
[1:03:30] there's been a great mystery
[1:03:32] there was a great mystery through the
[1:03:33] bible and christ is the mystery of god
[1:03:35] revealed
[1:03:37] but
[1:03:38] christ is the word made manifest in its
[1:03:42] age and in its season
[1:03:45] and there's attributes that are being
[1:03:48] made manifest in this day
[1:03:50] and that's part of that great mystery
[1:03:53] and that makes you and i part of that
[1:03:55] great mystery
[1:03:57] and if we can catch that revelation
[1:03:59] friends
[1:04:00] it'll settle us down
[1:04:02] it'll take away all the bouncing around
[1:04:05] and doubts and confusion and the ups and
[1:04:08] downs it'll settle that out and say you
[1:04:10] know what
[1:04:11] when christ was revealed i was revealed
[1:04:13] with him
[1:04:16] when he moved
[1:04:17] from thought into logos
[1:04:20] i was there
[1:04:22] when the logos when the word was being
[1:04:24] expressed this is why brother branham
[1:04:26] said amen when moses was coming out of
[1:04:28] egypt i was there
[1:04:31] i was there when noah got into the ark i
[1:04:34] was there you know when brother bram
[1:04:35] starts going down through i was there
[1:04:37] why because i'm part of the same thing
[1:04:39] that expression i'm part of the same
[1:04:40] thing
[1:04:42] come from the same place the word
[1:04:44] expressed word and everywhere the word
[1:04:46] is expressed i'm part of that expression
[1:04:50] that's why moses and noah and all of
[1:04:52] them are part of you and i
[1:04:55] that's why all of them without us cannot
[1:04:57] yet be made perfect
[1:04:59] because we're all part of the word
[1:05:01] expressing god and now's our day and
[1:05:04] now's our portion and when christ was
[1:05:06] revealed you and i were revealed with
[1:05:08] him
[1:05:09] man god bless you let's stand i'm not
[1:05:10] going to go any further
[1:05:12] i intended for today to be shorter
[1:05:15] because
[1:05:16] i want to take a longer time on sunday
[1:05:23] i just there's a next part i just did
[1:05:24] not want to get into yet tonight so i
[1:05:27] just cut it off and said i just want to
[1:05:28] do this i'm still not to the part i want
[1:05:31] to get to these last two services have
[1:05:32] been foundation for really where i want
[1:05:34] to get where my heart is so pray for
[1:05:36] sunday but listen friends
[1:05:39] when we talk about christ
[1:05:41] it's so much more than what we used to
[1:05:43] think
[1:05:45] when we realize what this great mystery
[1:05:47] that's been in the whole bible it's god
[1:05:50] materializing
[1:05:51] it's god condescending it's god becoming
[1:05:55] tangible through all of his attributes
[1:05:56] through all those expressions it's way
[1:05:58] more than we could ever envision and i
[1:06:00] still think today we haven't even begun
[1:06:02] to imagine what it really means
[1:06:06] but if we could just believe what the
[1:06:08] prophet told us and accept it and allow
[1:06:10] that to settle our heart and say
[1:06:12] i was with him there and i was with him
[1:06:14] there i was with him there and he's not
[1:06:17] going to lose me because he can't lose
[1:06:19] me
[1:06:22] something not my flesh my flesh is
[1:06:25] rotten you know this is one of the
[1:06:26] problems we run into when we start
[1:06:27] talking about the bride is the
[1:06:29] expression of christ people start to
[1:06:31] look to flesh and they say you make a
[1:06:32] mistake and you do something wrong
[1:06:34] that's not the part i'm talking about
[1:06:36] i'm talking about something down in the
[1:06:37] soul amen that seed gene of god that
[1:06:40] expresses the word of god amen and so
[1:06:42] when you see me if you see me make a
[1:06:44] mistake and you see me do something
[1:06:46] contrary to the word i just want to tell
[1:06:47] you right now amen that's not god that's
[1:06:50] me
[1:06:52] that's my old hybrid flesh amen as my
[1:06:54] old nature raising up that's not god
[1:06:56] that's me
[1:06:58] but when you see an expression of christ
[1:07:01] come through me amen and it matches the
[1:07:03] word it surrenders to the word and
[1:07:04] expresses i want you to know that's not
[1:07:06] me that's him
[1:07:10] see we have a hard time separating the
[1:07:12] outer man from the inner man the hybrid
[1:07:14] part from the sea gene of god and if we
[1:07:16] could just do that we would realize so
[1:07:18] much of what we struggle with is the
[1:07:20] outer man and the outer man is going to
[1:07:23] crumble to pieces one day be dead or be
[1:07:25] changed amen this is not the part that
[1:07:28] we're worried about it's the part down
[1:07:29] on inside that came from god god will
[1:07:32] refashion the outside amen so that he
[1:07:34] can live in a full expression on the
[1:07:36] inside
[1:07:38] but that's where the confusion comes in
[1:07:40] you know how can i be the manifestation
[1:07:42] of christ and i just i mean i talked
[1:07:44] hateful with my wife yesterday that's
[1:07:46] not the manifestation of christ that's
[1:07:48] you in your hybrid form
[1:07:51] but when you surrender and humble
[1:07:52] yourself amen and the holy ghost moves
[1:07:54] you back and you surrender and you make
[1:07:56] things right that's not you that's god
[1:07:58] in you
[1:08:00] when you surrender to this word when you
[1:08:02] hear the prophet straighten out the
[1:08:04] scriptures and you say that's right when
[1:08:05] he straightens out the doctrine and you
[1:08:07] ditch your ideas and you say that's
[1:08:08] nothing but the truth that wasn't you
[1:08:10] that was him
[1:08:13] if we recognize that
[1:08:15] a lot of the manipulation that the enemy
[1:08:17] tries the tactics he tries on us will
[1:08:19] begin to go away and say listen
[1:08:22] i know i messed up that's not god's
[1:08:24] faltest mind
[1:08:27] i know i failed to manifest christ today
[1:08:29] that wasn't his fault that's mine
[1:08:32] but there's something in me that's going
[1:08:34] to come back and say i'm sorry god amen
[1:08:36] i'll give myself to you and i'll lay
[1:08:38] myself at your feet and take me and do
[1:08:40] your will with me and manifest yourself
[1:08:42] through me and let this word live in me
[1:08:45] that's him that's the seed that's rising
[1:08:47] up and saying it's got to be him and not
[1:08:49] me
[1:08:52] we didn't
[1:08:54] save ourselves we're not wonderful
[1:08:55] people we're not special we're not great
[1:08:58] we're none of those things
[1:09:00] but the real you
[1:09:02] the sea gene of god on the inside what
[1:09:04] meant to be you all along that's
[1:09:06] beautiful and that's perfect and that's
[1:09:07] special
[1:09:09] we are a walking contradiction
[1:09:16] think about it brother branham told his
[1:09:17] daughter he said if you want to see how
[1:09:19] important you are stick your finger in a
[1:09:20] bucket of water and find the hole that
[1:09:22] you left behind
[1:09:24] so that's how important you are
[1:09:26] then brother brahm turns around and says
[1:09:28] you can no more be lost than god can be
[1:09:30] lost
[1:09:31] [Music]
[1:09:32] and god is not complete without you
[1:09:35] but then he'll say we're nothing he can
[1:09:38] do without me but i can't do without him
[1:09:42] we're a walking contradiction
[1:09:46] you
[1:09:47] that was born of earthly parents that is
[1:09:50] just material from the earth with the
[1:09:53] earthly spirit that is nothing special
[1:09:55] nothing important and
[1:09:57] you're not doing god any favors
[1:10:01] but that portion of himself that he's
[1:10:03] portioned out to live down inside of you
[1:10:06] he'll never lose that part
[1:10:09] and he can't do without that part
[1:10:13] it's important for us to keep it
[1:10:15] separated in our minds
[1:10:17] or else we begin to look at the outer
[1:10:19] man as perfection
[1:10:21] and it causes a whole bunch of confusion
[1:10:24] but it's the life
[1:10:26] that's why every day paul said i die
[1:10:29] daily
[1:10:31] that's why he said i keep under my body
[1:10:33] which means to beat it back black and
[1:10:34] blue i keep under my body lest when i
[1:10:36] preach to others i myself should be a
[1:10:39] castaway
[1:10:40] that's why we have to recognize my enemy
[1:10:42] is my flesh
[1:10:45] but the real me
[1:10:47] is an attribute of almighty god
[1:10:49] i am a son of god
[1:10:51] and i can no more be lost and he can be
[1:10:54] lost
[1:10:55] but i am worthless and nothing
[1:10:58] at the same time
[1:11:00] and if we could have that attitude in
[1:11:02] that approach
[1:11:04] it'll settle us down in the time of
[1:11:05] trouble and it'll keep us from trusting
[1:11:08] our flesh and becoming proud and
[1:11:09] arrogant
[1:11:10] it'll keep us humble and confident
[1:11:14] it'll keep us bold and checked
[1:11:17] it'll keep us in the right frame of mind
[1:11:20] man let's bow our heads and pray
[1:11:23] lord jesus we thank you for this
[1:11:25] wonderful day that you've given us
[1:11:27] we thank you for this word this
[1:11:29] revelation that you've given to us
[1:11:31] as we go over it again lord and rehearse
[1:11:33] the things that have been told to us
[1:11:35] lord let it register in our soul
[1:11:38] let it go deep down lord and may there
[1:11:40] be a settledness that comes into us
[1:11:43] lord that we would understand lord what
[1:11:46] your plan is because of the revelation
[1:11:47] of the hour
[1:11:49] that there'd be no confusion and no
[1:11:50] doubt that we would have a comprehension
[1:11:53] of what it is you're doing in our lives
[1:11:54] and what it is you're doing in this age
[1:11:58] god we pray that you would just help us
[1:12:00] to surrender lord
[1:12:01] to give ourselves completely over to you
[1:12:04] that you might take these vessels and
[1:12:06] manifest yourself through them
[1:12:08] for god we believe that is the
[1:12:10] manifestation of christ in this day
[1:12:13] that your manifestation of your mind
[1:12:15] your will your heart is going to be on
[1:12:18] display
[1:12:19] in these bodies of flesh
[1:12:22] god we need you
[1:12:24] we can't do it ourselves we must have
[1:12:26] your spirit to anoint us your word to
[1:12:28] direct us lord
[1:12:30] and may we flesh out the word that
[1:12:32] you've ordained to be manifest in this
[1:12:35] day
[1:12:36] we love you we ask that you be with each
[1:12:38] of us
[1:12:39] carry us home lord
[1:12:41] use us and anoint us for your purpose we
[1:12:43] pray
[1:12:44] in jesus christ's name
