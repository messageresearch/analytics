[4:15] and Christ the Lord is
[4:18] here. Well, I would not be
[4:23] denied. I would not be
[4:28] denied till Jesus came and made me
[4:33] whole. I would not be denied. Verse
[4:37] three, old Satan said, "My Lord was gone
[4:43] and would not hear my

[5:05] denied till Jesus came and made me
[5:10] whole. I would not be
[5:14] denied. Amen. It's good to be with you

[5:37] time. Through the darkest night, his
[5:42] light will shine. God is good. Oh, God
[5:47] is
[5:48] good all the time. If you're
[5:53] walking, if you're
[5:56] walking through the
[5:58] valley, there are shadows all
[6:04] around. Do not
[6:06] fear. He will guide you. He will keep
[6:11] you safe and sound.
[6:15] For he has
[6:16] promised to never leave you nor forsake
[6:22] you. And his word is true. God is
[6:27] good all the
[6:29] time. What a song of praise in this
[6:34] heart of mine. God is

[6:55] three. And though I may not
[7:00] understand all the plans you have for
[7:06] me. My life is in your

[7:14] can clearly
[7:17] see God is

[7:22] time. Put a song of praise in this heart
[7:27] of mine. God is

[8:02] seats.
[8:04] Amen. God is good all the time. Even in
[8:08] the not so easy times, it's good. Amen.
[8:11] We can look back over our lives. If
[8:13] you've traveled this journey any length
[8:15] of time, you can look back and say, "God
[8:17] is perfect in all of his ways and all
[8:19] that he does is good." Amen. It's
[8:22] wonderful to be together this morning.
[8:23] God bless you all so very much. It's a
[8:26] treat to have our brother Marcus Becker
[8:27] with us again. It's been three years
[8:29] since he's been here and we we get used
[8:31] to him stopping by every year or two. So
[8:33] 3 years seems like forever. And so he's
[8:35] been a bit busy and had some things to
[8:37] work on and some transitions in his
[8:39] work, but now he's here and we're so
[8:40] happy to have him. And so he'll be
[8:42] ministering here this morning here in a
[8:44] few minutes. And then this afternoon in
[8:46] the fellowship hall, we have a a youth
[8:48] service that he'll be ministering at 4
[8:50] p.m. And so that's for all the youth,
[8:52] those in the uh youth group and the
[8:54] young adults group. We are all welcome
[8:56] there. And so we're looking forward to
[8:58] that as well. Man, we just got back last
[9:00] evening from the young adults weekend up
[9:02] in Michigan and we had a wonderful time.
[9:04] It was quite a blessing to be with all
[9:06] of our young adults and um we had
[9:09] brother Nathaniel and sister Charity
[9:11] Saias come by uh for um Friday evening
[9:16] and they gave their testimony, shared
[9:17] their testimony with with the whole
[9:19] group. And it was really nice to have
[9:21] them come and share their testimony,
[9:23] what God had done for them and how he
[9:25] led them through and brought them
[9:26] together and and it was good. And then
[9:28] brother Nathaniel did the Saturday
[9:30] morning devotion for us. So that was
[9:32] really tremendous. So we were excited to
[9:34] have them. So we had a wonderful time.
[9:36] We're a little bit tired because they
[9:38] like to stay up
[9:40] late and it seems like stay up late and
[9:42] get up early. I don't know how they do
[9:44] it but they do it. So me and my wife
[9:46] were on opposite shifts. I stayed up
[9:47] late make sure everybody got tucked in.
[9:49] She got up early to make coffee at 6:30
[9:52] in the morning. So Amen. But praise God
[9:55] everybody fits in their place. Amen.
[9:58] Amen. So, we had a good time. Amen. It's
[10:01] good to have the Abbott family here with
[10:02] us again. God bless you all. It's good
[10:04] to have you sitting there. Amen. The
[10:06] last time we seen them was in Poland.
[10:07] Amen. Just a month ago. So, God is good.
[10:11] All the other visitors, I saw there's a
[10:12] few more. God bless you. You're very
[10:14] welcome. We're glad that you're here
[10:15] with us. And God bless you. Blake, you
[10:18] may be seated.

[19:16] I
[19:17] love you,
[19:21] Lord.
[19:24] Sing I love you, Lord.
[19:30] [Music]
[19:33] See
[19:35] love
[19:38] you
[19:40] Lord
[19:42] I
[19:45] love you. Now while the music is softly
[19:48] playing let's bow our heads and if you
[19:50] want that the Lord speaks to you
[19:52] something personal you just raise your
[19:54] hands to God. Heavenly Father, we thank
[19:56] you for these wonderful songs. And my
[19:59] desire is as our most noble pastor was
[20:02] praying already that you just take me in
[20:04] your hands that we have a wonderful time
[20:07] and sharing the goodness of God, Father.
[20:10] May you take me under your control. Give
[20:12] me the right words, Father. Give me the
[20:14] right approach, Father. And give the
[20:16] right earrings to the listeners to
[20:19] understand it the right way. Bless the
[20:21] church back home in Beetlesburg. Bless
[20:24] the bride in the US, Father. Bless the
[20:26] churches that are around here. Bless
[20:28] them in their ministry for this morning,
[20:30] Father. And Lord, definitely may you
[20:33] bless Israel, Father, because those who
[20:35] bless Israel, they are blessed. May you
[20:37] bless the weakman among us. And may this
[20:40] morning be of a help to them to
[20:42] understand that God takes control of the
[20:46] situation. And so we lay everything into
[20:49] your hand. them. We ask these things in
[20:52] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen
[20:55] and amen. Hallelujah. God bless you.
[20:58] Now, while we're standing, let's open
[20:59] the word of the Lord in two scriptures.
[21:03] And I thank definitely the musicians and
[21:05] oh I
[21:10] see in the second book of Samuel chapter
[21:14] 23 verse
[21:16] 13
[21:18] Samuel
[21:22] 23:13 and the three of the 30 chief went
[21:26] down and came to David to in the harvest
[21:28] time unto the cave of Adulam and The
[21:32] troop of the Philistine pitched in the
[21:35] valley of Rephim. And David was in a
[21:37] hold and in the garrison and the
[21:39] Philistines was in Bethlehem. And David
[21:42] longed and said, "Oh, that one would
[21:44] give me a drink of the water of the well
[21:46] of Bethlehem, which is by the gate." And
[21:48] the three mighty men break through the
[21:50] host of the Philistines, and drew water
[21:53] out of the well of Bethlehem that was by
[21:55] the gate, and took it, and brought it to
[21:57] David. Nevertheless, he would not drink
[22:00] thereof, but poured it out unto the
[22:02] Lord. And he said, "Be it far from me,
[22:04] oh Lord, that I should this is not this
[22:07] the blood of the man that went in
[22:10] jeopardy of their lives." Therefore, you
[22:13] would not drink it. These things did
[22:15] these three mighty men. And may we read
[22:19] in the book of the Hebrews, chapter 2,
[22:23] verse 11.
[22:26] Hebrews
[22:29] 2:1 and it speaks of Christ and the
[22:34] bride for
[22:36] okay I give room to to find it for me
[22:39] it's page
[22:41] 1,428 but it will it will not help
[22:46] you for
[22:49] both he that sanctifies and they who are
[22:53] sanctified are all of one. Amen. And
[22:57] that's that's
[22:58] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[23:01] call them brethren.
[23:04] So may the Lord add his blessing to the
[23:06] reading of his word. We may be seated.
[23:10] It's a great pleasure for me to be back
[23:12] here after 3 years and there was many
[23:14] many things to do. I never forgot you. I
[23:17] never forsake you. Forsook you. But I
[23:20] went different times to South Africa and
[23:22] different other things to do in my job.
[23:23] there's a changing of my job and and uh
[23:27] things to do in the church. And right
[23:29] back here we are uh if you remember
[23:31] three years ago we had that project a
[23:33] new project about Israel and that kind
[23:35] of documentation that we're doing and
[23:37] I'm back on track and we we continue
[23:40] again on that thing. And so I I uh I'm
[23:43] I'm that was the reason for my coming
[23:45] meeting brother Steven and other
[23:47] brothers and and therefore I said
[23:48] brother Chad for me it's fine even to
[23:50] listen I will not but I will not be in
[23:52] Ohio without saying hello to my to to
[23:54] the BCF family and definitely so and I
[23:58] thank you very much for for your
[24:00] friendship to uh for your for your
[24:02] kindness for letting me feel to be here
[24:05] at home. I bring greetings from my
[24:07] pastor about the road to wall bring
[24:08] greetings from Andreas Ringan from my
[24:11] family as you heard already that soon
[24:14] Andreas and me we will become one by
[24:16] marriage and uh yeah that's exactly so
[24:20] and uh or let me say not him and me but
[24:25] uh but my daughter will marry his boy so
[24:29] so we we will have a certain
[24:31] relationship. Huh? I remember that Mark
[24:34] Twain said one time he said, "Marriage
[24:36] is a wonderful instrument to solve
[24:38] problems together that you never had
[24:41] before." And so it seems we were always
[24:44] good friends until now. I hope it will
[24:45] stay that way that we don't come my boy
[24:47] and your girl. But really greetings from
[24:50] brother Garrett from from the church
[24:52] from different ministers that were here.
[24:53] even brother uh that I met yesterday,
[24:55] brother Dwayne, he sends his greetings
[24:57] to the whole congregation, brother
[24:58] brother Paula Fontaine, brother
[24:59] Nathaniel and and and so we wish you all
[25:02] God's blessings. It's a pleasure to be
[25:04] here and if you wouldn't mind I have a I
[25:08] have a wonderful subject to share with
[25:09] you and uh uh because it really deals
[25:12] with us not because it's it's a special
[25:14] Marcus Beckup subject but it is just I
[25:17] was preaching it a couple of months ago
[25:19] in our church and when I got the
[25:21] invitation to come here from brother
[25:22] Chad I think that is just wonderful and
[25:24] I think I trust it will fit definitely
[25:27] in your in in definitely in the vision
[25:30] and uh I would like to entitle the
[25:33] sermon uh we are the words in the book.
[25:36] Amen. We are the words in the book.
[25:40] And and and the thing is this that now
[25:43] the subject for this morning we are not
[25:45] preaching messages. Okay. The message is
[25:48] preached. We preach sermons. Okay.
[25:51] Please understand I looked it up this
[25:52] morning that my sermon of this morning
[25:55] does not have any claim to be
[25:58] complete. Okay. Or balance. That's not
[26:02] possible in 90 minutes. Not possible.
[26:04] There's a lot of aspect that that I
[26:06] couldn't talk about it. Especially when
[26:08] it comes to the to the book of
[26:10] revelation. It is not it's not every
[26:13] aspect is balanced. It's not complete.
[26:15] It's but it gives a vision. It gives a a
[26:17] certain view on certain things. Okay.
[26:20] And then I want to say this, the service
[26:22] for this morning is only for the bride.
[26:25] Amen. This message is for the bride.
[26:29] But but there is a church.
[26:32] There is there is a I don't speak about
[26:33] this church. There's a church which is
[26:35] not the bride.
[26:37] And brother Brandham he he he he he he
[26:41] was he was really um corrected by God.
[26:45] And God says to him, brother Bham spoke
[26:47] about these unbelievers. He called them
[26:49] Rickys and Ricettas. Brother and God
[26:52] says you shouldn't do this. They are
[26:54] still many of them are still my
[26:55] children. Okay. And then brother
[26:57] Brandham in the message standing gap
[26:59] said he said don't lose the feeling for
[27:01] the people.
[27:03] See you must remember they are not made
[27:06] out of sawdust. They are flesh and blood
[27:10] human beings with a soul. So if we
[27:14] should never you know when when through
[27:16] the opening of the word God did not
[27:18] change his nature. God said he so much
[27:21] loved the world. Amen. John 3:16 so much
[27:25] loved the world, not cosmos, but the
[27:27] world. And and and he he still hates
[27:31] sin, but he loves the human beings. He
[27:33] loves he loves sinners. And I so much
[27:37] loved about about the book of Jonah. And
[27:41] we went through this. I mean, I tell you
[27:43] one thing, when we were younger, we were
[27:45] we were cursing
[27:46] everyone. First cursing all the
[27:48] unbelievers then all denominations were
[27:50] cursed and then everybody in the message
[27:52] who did not believe like us was cursed
[27:55] until we find out we are seed of Abraham
[27:57] man we are born to bless people you
[28:01] cannot change a person a person is is a
[28:03] bride by predestination you know but if
[28:06] he's not bride it doesn't mean he's
[28:07] nothing he has a soul he has feelings
[28:10] and he has a he has he has a a life to
[28:13] live and and so we should never lose
[28:17] lose the feeling for a dying world.
[28:20] You see,
[28:21] and we came out sometime from a time
[28:24] where where we were so arrogant that we
[28:26] even could shake another one's hands who
[28:28] doesn't have the same doctrine like us.
[28:31] This message is not made for this. It
[28:34] was just the the immaturity that we have
[28:37] sometime. We were teenagers. I remember
[28:39] we went out like John Wayne coming from
[28:42] from his out of the saddle and we said,
[28:44] "Do you want to have a quote?
[28:47] But today we we are there to help people
[28:50] and and not only by my job brother I had
[28:52] to deal with people who who come even in
[28:55] the message from dysfunctional families
[28:58] people who who try to commit suicide I
[29:00] mean I have to deal with kind of people
[29:02] like this in depressions uh abuse child
[29:06] abuse emotional abuse can he can happen
[29:09] in a church definitely so and and and
[29:13] then you find out you cannot preach
[29:14] slogans
[29:16] You you you must bring life to them, a
[29:19] solution. Brother, I find out that
[29:21] nothing is too too too hard for the
[29:23] Lord. Nothing is too hard for the Lord.
[29:26] And there is there is still there is
[29:27] still a light. So you remember he was
[29:30] that man by the name of of Jonah and he
[29:32] he he he
[29:34] uh he was just dismissing his message
[29:36] and the people repented and God changed
[29:40] his mind. I was preaching in in brother
[29:44] Paulente about 1977 how brother Bren
[29:47] never made a mistake and God never made
[29:48] a mistake but God has a language you see
[29:51] that only the bride understands and God
[29:54] postponed that that that judgment
[29:58] because of the reaction of the king.
[30:00] Brother Braymond said judgment stops the
[30:03] judgment of God. True repentance stops
[30:06] it. We see it came but it came later.
[30:09] And here is that man by the name of
[30:11] Jonah. And he he was just sitting on
[30:14] that on that on that hill. And really so
[30:18] much rejoicing that the fire would fall.
[30:22] So much rejoicing that the fire would
[30:23] because I mean I'm saved and I'm here
[30:25] and let the fire and then God came and
[30:28] showed his heart.
[30:30] He said look these people 100,000 people
[30:33] they don't know left from right. They
[30:36] don't know. God showing a lot of a lot
[30:38] of empathy for dying world. So we should
[30:41] never lose this and we should never lose
[30:43] a feeling for Israel.
[30:45] Because if when Jesus is the king of
[30:47] Israel, then the bride is the queen of
[30:49] Israel.
[30:51] If Jesus is the king of Israel, then the
[30:53] bride is the queen of Israel. We should
[30:55] always have a prayer. There's a quote
[30:57] where brother Brandham said, "You you
[30:58] honor a Jew and God will honor you."
[31:01] Quote, Brother Brandham. So, so in that
[31:03] thing is is is is definitely therefore I
[31:06] want to say this morning the service for
[31:09] this morning is only for the bride. It's
[31:11] for you. Amen. If somebody is streaming
[31:13] in uh let me say a good old Baptist or
[31:17] whatever that's fine but this is a
[31:20] message for for the bride. But I want to
[31:22] repeat myself outside of the bride is
[31:24] not nothing. It's not nothing. There's
[31:27] people Amen. I believe that God still is
[31:30] standing on the street corners and say,
[31:32] "Is there somebody else who wants to be
[31:34] reconciled with God? Is there somebody
[31:36] who wants to who wants to receive that
[31:38] invitation?" We cannot make people
[31:40] bright. Bride comes from God and will go
[31:43] back to God. But there's still room at
[31:46] the cross. Whosoever will come, let him
[31:48] come. Amen. Blessed be the name of the
[31:51] Lord. It's so important for me. Uh we we
[31:54] had some times uh when we were when we
[31:56] were just a chosen
[31:59] frozen the truth. But I'm happy. I was I
[32:02] was confronted with life situation
[32:04] brother when when I was I I'm I'm
[32:07] I'm praying more when I'm go to work
[32:09] than I go to church. You see because
[32:11] they are people. Even Muslims they have
[32:13] a soul man. They have feelings. They are
[32:16] mothers. They are father. They are
[32:17] children. They are not nothing. They
[32:18] they're not animals. They are people.
[32:20] Amen. And I pray a lot you know and you
[32:22] I want to tell this you never help
[32:24] people by despising them. This message
[32:27] is not a cult. Why should I become
[32:29] cultish?
[32:31] This message is not a sect. Why should I
[32:33] become sectarian?
[32:35] This message is not a denomination. Why
[32:37] should I become denominational with all
[32:39] that that that nonsense?
[32:41] You see this message is our father
[32:44] speaking to us. Brings us on a higher
[32:46] level. Come up John. Come a little bit
[32:48] higher. Amen. Amen. This is bride age.
[32:51] This is special age. This is age of
[32:53] mature to be matured and and and uh so
[32:57] there is a let me say a certain hotel
[33:00] where these people live and I have to
[33:02] take care of them and in in different
[33:04] things become a brother to them a father
[33:07] and I I just honor them a little bit by
[33:10] saying inshallah inshallah it's it's it
[33:13] just means if the Lord is willing Allah
[33:15] is not a name Allah is just a title it's
[33:17] God. Allah is God. Inshallah means we
[33:19] are doing this if the Lord is willing.
[33:21] So I I come to them. I said inshallah.
[33:24] And they said, "Mr. Becca, will we make
[33:25] a good Muslim out of you?" I said, "No,
[33:27] I don't think so. I don't think so."
[33:29] Okay. But but but you we're not helping
[33:33] people by despising them. No, we show
[33:36] them. I remember now you can talk about
[33:38] bride age. Here is brother Brham and he
[33:40] goes into the temple of the James and he
[33:42] puts off his shoes. Amen. Puts off his
[33:44] shoes. just show this is precious to
[33:46] these people. So why should I trample
[33:49] over some people's feelings? No, no, no,
[33:52] no, no, brother. It backfires. If we
[33:54] don't respect, it backfires on us sooner
[33:56] or later. Can you say amen? So I want to
[33:58] repeat myself. Everything that I said is
[34:00] pure for the bride. And we
[34:04] understand for this sermon for this
[34:06] morning and we understand that David is
[34:10] a is a precious
[34:12] man is a he's a future king and but he
[34:19] is a he's a people he's a person who is
[34:22] standing in his own way a little
[34:24] bit and he's not very fortunate. He's
[34:28] not privileged. He is what we would call
[34:30] an underdog. Yeah, because his father
[34:33] never see the potential in the boy. And
[34:36] when the king comes to anoint his next
[34:39] son, then father never thought about
[34:43] David. Here comes here comes the oldest.
[34:46] Here comes the biggest. I always say
[34:47] here comes Schwatzenegger. Okay. And
[34:50] father said, "Now here's the king."
[34:53] And but but but but it's fine to have
[34:58] muscles. Okay? I always say when I was a
[35:01] young boy I made bodybuilding.
[35:03] Okay. Everything that you see here was
[35:07] here. It's just a change of
[35:09] dispensation. Everything that you see
[35:11] was here. So So I I and I love what
[35:14] brother Chad said, keep a balance. Keep
[35:17] a balance. Young people, they were not
[35:19] running around with the Bible the whole
[35:21] day. They want to have, let me say,
[35:23] fellowship. Let them have it. That but I
[35:25] told the youngsters, but you have to
[35:27] make soul building, brother. Not only
[35:28] bodybuilding, soul building. Okay. So,
[35:31] here comes the next one. And he's
[35:33] Windows XP. He can quote. He I mean, he
[35:36] brings things together. He could
[35:37] impress. But God is not impressed by
[35:40] knowledge.
[35:42] You see, sometimes you have singers and
[35:44] they think that can impress God. Okay,
[35:47] here comes Jimmy Swagger.
[35:51] Jesus. I mean, they think that can
[35:53] impress God. God, the angels can sing
[35:55] better than us. Amen. God is not
[35:57] impressed. God is impressed by a heart
[36:00] that serve the Lord.
[36:02] Somebody God is impressed by love. You
[36:05] see, and here is little David and he
[36:08] doesn't see his
[36:10] potential and the father doesn't see his
[36:13] potential. But God placed something in
[36:16] him that doesn't come from papa and
[36:18] mama. It comes from God. Can you say
[36:21] amen? Yeah. So if you help me the
[36:23] technicians to to to
[36:25] to just develop that subject, it is
[36:29] beautiful. Amen. Amen.
[36:34] Give me a
[36:37] second. So here's what brother Brand
[36:39] says. He says, "Now you see the seals
[36:44] when he was in his miltorial work back
[36:46] there redeeming." And that's not the
[36:48] subject for this morning. But someday he
[36:51] comes forth to get this book that he
[36:55] redeemed and all that this book would be
[36:58] him for. That's the believer. The words
[37:02] in the book and the word is him and
[37:06] that's all and all that's in it. Amen.
[37:10] The believer, the bride is the words
[37:14] that's in the book. Amen. We are the
[37:17] words in that book. That's right. Amen.
[37:20] We will find out when the lamb takes the
[37:22] book, what does he make? He takes us
[37:25] right. This message that we believe is
[37:27] not a seminary. It's a relationship
[37:30] between God and man.
[37:33] Brother, we tried everything. We tried
[37:35] reformation.
[37:37] And reformation never worked. We tried
[37:40] Pentecostalism and it never worked. We
[37:43] tried We tried Methodism, it never
[37:46] worked. We tried churchianity, it never
[37:48] worked. Amen. But in God's heart, it was
[37:51] time of ignorance. But the Bible says in
[37:53] the days of the voice of the seventh
[37:55] angel, the mystery,
[37:57] not mysteries. Scoffield had mysteries.
[38:01] Lin had mysteries. Nothing against that.
[38:04] But the mystery is God revealing his
[38:08] back part of his own mind.
[38:11] We are the first generation who
[38:12] understand God. Yeah, God does not talk
[38:16] to us with us like in a kindergarten.
[38:20] God talks with us as adults. It's the
[38:23] time when God says you are not
[38:25] Pentecostal babies though they were born
[38:28] again. Amen. Because you cannot be a
[38:31] baby without being born again. But God
[38:33] says don't be a baby. Yeah. Stand before
[38:36] me like a man. I want to talk with you
[38:39] like an adult, like a matured person.
[38:42] Amen. Can you say amen? Amen. So we
[38:45] understand to understand that that the
[38:49] what it means to be bride. This is the
[38:52] service for the bride this morning. So
[38:54] brother Brham said when he first was God
[38:57] Jehovah out of him. Let's just picture
[39:00] now as a little drama so you can get it.
[39:03] Let's see coming out of space where was
[39:06] nothing. Let's make it a little white
[39:07] light like a mystic light like a halo.
[39:10] And that was the logos that went out of
[39:12] God in the beginning. That was the son
[39:14] of God that came out of the bosom of the
[39:15] father. That was was in the beginning
[39:18] was the word and the word was with God
[39:20] and the word was God and the word was
[39:22] made flesh and dwelt among us. In the
[39:24] beginning was God and then out of God
[39:27] came the logos, a part of God that went
[39:30] out of God.
[39:31] Brother Brham said the first thing that
[39:34] God created were the angels. Here he
[39:37] says the first thing that came out of
[39:39] God was ilos. There's a big difference
[39:42] that for many years I didn't understand
[39:45] but ilos was not created.
[39:48] The logos came out of God. It's a big
[39:51] difference.
[39:52] Because I'm a I'm a man. I'm a I'm a I'm
[39:55] a craftsman and I created many things. I
[39:58] built a home and I I'm do but I only b
[40:01] one daughter. That's right. The
[40:03] difference between my creation and my
[40:05] birth was part of me is in my daughter.
[40:09] She has my DNA. Amen. Blessed be the
[40:12] name of the Lord. So out of out of out
[40:16] of that pillar of fire which was the
[40:19] same substance. I mean the father looked
[40:21] to the son and the son looked to the
[40:22] father. It's not two persons. It's the
[40:24] same substance.
[40:27] Out of it comes Melzdc. Yeah. Out of me
[40:30] mazes come Jesus of Nazareth. The bride
[40:33] was in Christ. Says brother Brandon.
[40:35] Amen. Amen. In what form ever? But she
[40:38] was in him. Amen. So when the bride was
[40:41] in Christ and the bride must have been
[40:43] in Melzdc. Amen. And if the bride was in
[40:46] Melzdc, she must have been in the pillar
[40:48] of fire. And if she was in the pillar of
[40:50] fire, she was in God in the beginning.
[40:53] Can you say amen?
[40:55] Amen. We see that brother Brand makes
[40:58] another quote. He says, "The eternal
[41:01] thoughts of God." Amen. Let me ask you,
[41:05] are the thoughts of God eternal? Yes,
[41:07] sir. If you can see this, yes, you will
[41:10] see many things. Praise God. If you see
[41:13] this, you can see many things. Okay. God
[41:16] is unchangeable in both essence and
[41:18] behavior. He is omnisient. He has never
[41:20] had a new thought about anything because
[41:22] all of his thoughts that he has always
[41:24] had and always will have and knows the
[41:26] end from the beginning because he's God.
[41:28] Thus the thoughts of God are eternal.
[41:30] They are real. They are not simply like
[41:33] a man with a blueprint he has drawn up
[41:35] which one day will be translated into
[41:37] substance and form. But they are already
[41:40] real, eternal, and part of God.
[41:43] Amen. Amen. There's a quote when brother
[41:45] said, "In the beginning, God was alone
[41:48] with his thoughts." Yes sir. In other
[41:50] words, he wasn't alone. We were with
[41:52] him. Amen. He was alone with his
[41:55] thoughts. And his thoughts is not God
[41:58] was thinking.
[42:00] Amen. God had attributes in him. His
[42:03] thoughts, his family, his bride, his
[42:06] children, the part of God that had to be
[42:09] expressed in our time. Hallelujah. Amen.
[42:11] Brother, if you don't if you don't come
[42:13] from God, you can never go back to God.
[42:15] That's right. You can be saved. That's
[42:17] the difference. Yeah. Amen. You can be
[42:20] saved. Amen. But you can only go go back
[42:22] to God if you came from God. Your
[42:25] destiny is your origin. I remember years
[42:28] ago, brother Beckett made that little
[42:30] expression. He said, "Here was the
[42:31] family of God all standing together."
[42:35] Amen. In what form ever? Because brother
[42:38] said before the foundation of the world,
[42:40] God made a picture of his family. Of you
[42:43] and me. And God took our souls and
[42:46] throwed them in seven church ages over
[42:49] seven continents in in in in parts of
[42:51] the world. And God put part of himself
[42:54] into his bride.
[42:57] Because David said in the Psalms, he
[42:59] said God made everything perfect in his
[43:01] time. He even placed eternity into our
[43:04] hearts. And there is only one who is
[43:06] eternal. That's God himself. So when you
[43:09] were born, you had already a heavenly
[43:11] navigation system in you.
[43:13] Amen. It's only for the bride. Amen.
[43:16] Because they came from God. And brother
[43:18] and and and one thing is sure when seven
[43:20] church ages are over, nobody is missing.
[43:25] We will be all there because God cannot
[43:28] forget himself. Quote, "Brother
[43:30] Brandham, God is not anymore complete
[43:33] without you. That's only the bride.
[43:36] That's not whosoever come, let him come.
[43:38] That's fine. I'm going to have that way.
[43:40] Ah, give a give a open. Don't bury the
[43:43] world too too too early. Don't bury it.
[43:46] No, give them a light. This world has no
[43:48] solution, brother. We live and we will
[43:51] see this afternoon. And I know for the
[43:52] young people, it's a little bit abstract
[43:54] this morning, but we will break it down
[43:56] for the young people this afternoon
[43:58] about about child child upbringing and
[44:00] so forth. Brother, we have to understand
[44:02] we live in a sick society. Yes. And it's
[44:06] not the fault of the people. You know, I
[44:08] was always reading Timothy wrong as
[44:10] people were monsters. But the Bible says
[44:13] people uh you know, truth breakers,
[44:15] false and false accusers. He said
[44:17] without natural affections.
[44:20] That's the reason one sick generation
[44:23] produces a sicker next generation and a
[44:26] sicker next generation. It's not the
[44:27] fault of the people, but this is a sick
[44:30] society. And brother, the only thing
[44:32] that helps is not arrogance. The only
[44:35] thing that helps people is healthy
[44:36] families with love, with empathy, with
[44:40] heart and soul and a gospel which gives
[44:42] them a hope
[44:44] and churches which have a warmness and
[44:46] an atmosphere to just that the sinner is
[44:49] welcome. Amen. Not a sin but the sinner
[44:52] must be welcomed. He said look there is
[44:54] a place because one day Amen. Yeah. We
[44:58] were not the same as we were today. I
[45:01] always tell it like this when I was we
[45:03] were unbelievers. I could dance like
[45:05] Michael Jackson only I could make the
[45:07] moonwalk like like my daughter always
[45:10] said don't be so embarrassing papa you
[45:11] never make it be no no no I will not do
[45:15] you see and we did not know who we were
[45:17] but God always knew who we were we
[45:21] should never forget from where we come
[45:22] from therefore sometime people cannot
[45:25] forgive because they don't know what
[45:27] forgiveness means
[45:29] amen it must go through a process when
[45:31] we are broken down and we need a savior
[45:34] and we need Calvary. And then we build
[45:36] up our life on a on a relationship with
[45:39] God. Can you say amen? So we understand
[45:43] there's a difference between a birth and
[45:47] a creation. Amen. We're burst. Amen.
[45:50] That was the beginning of the the
[45:52] discussion in Nia Rome about they called
[45:54] it homosios. The Greek word means of the
[45:58] same substance. Yes. The son is of the
[46:00] same substance as the father. It's not a
[46:02] second person. Yeah. Amen. So we
[46:04] understand that now Adam and Eve are
[46:07] made in the in in the garden of
[46:10] Eden and brother Bram said now our
[46:13] kinsman redeemer is handed a sevenseal
[46:16] book of redemption from the original
[46:18] owner when we lost it at the garden of
[46:20] Eden though Adam went back to original
[46:22] owner but there has been a poacher in
[46:24] the land a squatter and that's Satan he
[46:26] come over he's a poacher this earth
[46:28] belongs to him belongs to God but he's a
[46:30] poacher a squatter Man, how could I say
[46:33] something right now? But better not.
[46:35] It's the title deed of our redemption.
[46:36] This seven sealed book is the title
[46:38] deed. Amen. So, here is Adam and it was
[46:41] Eve. Amen. Now, when God called Adam,
[46:45] Adam, where are thou? Two people came.
[46:49] God never said, "Adam and Eve, where are
[46:51] them?" When Adam was called, Eve was
[46:53] called with him because she was part of
[46:55] him. Amen. You remember the vision that
[46:58] brother Brandham had when he when when
[46:59] when when he heard his name William
[47:01] Brandham and and first he heard Alman
[47:03] Neville and then he went up the stair
[47:05] staircase to meet the Lord. God just
[47:08] called William Brandham and he was hope
[47:09] and meter. Amen. When God when when the
[47:12] Bible speaks of Christ, Amen. It's
[47:15] always speaks Christ and the bride.
[47:17] Brother, it's your book. You are in it
[47:20] all over. It's your message. It's not a
[47:24] doctrine. It's not for only the the
[47:25] high. No, no, no. It's for us. Amen. So,
[47:28] we understand that when Eve fell, it was
[47:32] not because of immorality. That was not
[47:34] her problem. But she was searching for a
[47:36] new light. Yeah. Amen. Sometimes
[47:40] sometimes sometimes you we have young
[47:41] people, they come from a youth camp and
[47:44] I said, "How was it?" And they all like
[47:46] Trump say,
[47:48] "Tremendous,
[47:50] unbelievable. Nobody preached like him."
[47:53] And there's nothing wrong with it. Okay,
[47:55] don't get that. Go don't get me wrong on
[47:56] that. But then I asked the young people,
[47:58] I said, "Look, look what did you
[48:00] understand?" Nothing. Fine. But we are
[48:04] not here to impress the youngsters. We
[48:06] We have a message that comes from the
[48:08] presence of Almighty. Brother, sister, I
[48:11] hope I'm not hurting your feelings, but
[48:13] the message that we believe does not
[48:15] come from America. It comes from the
[48:17] presence of Almighty.
[48:19] Amen. Amen. And as I'm know that I'm
[48:23] have a lot of friends here at BCF. I'm a
[48:25] right to say anyhow all the Americans
[48:27] are backsliding Europeans
[48:29] anyhow. And it started with money. No
[48:32] taxation with our representation. Come
[48:34] on. Okay. But we belong to another
[48:36] kingdom. Is that okay for you? We're
[48:38] family of God. Okay. So I wouldn't make
[48:40] that joke at every place. You can be
[48:42] sure.
[48:43] Okay. And everybody is now streaming in.
[48:46] You need the lamb's nature.
[48:50] So here we see that God calls Adam and
[48:53] Eve was part of him. Okay. So please uh
[48:58] understand God's language. So Adam
[49:00] wasn't naked and had a big book.
[49:04] It's a symbol.
[49:06] The book is the seven sealed book. The
[49:09] title lead of our redemption. What is in
[49:11] the book? The family of God. We are the
[49:14] words in that book. That is the book
[49:16] that never came down on the day of
[49:19] Pentecost. Never ever. It came down in
[49:22] our time. This day, this scripture is
[49:25] fulfilled. Revelation 10:1-7. What does
[49:27] he have in his hand? The same book that
[49:29] Adam lost in the Garden of Eden. Three
[49:32] years ago, it was a prophecy. Now, it's
[49:34] history.
[49:37] But in that book is the family of God.
[49:39] Amen. Therefore, Adam can the Bible says
[49:43] give the animals their name. He did not
[49:46] name them. Adam was not a biologist.
[49:50] Adam revealed the names. And I can say
[49:52] that Adam says he play only belief. Yes.
[49:56] Only. And here comes the elephant. Your
[50:00] name is elephant. Is that all true? You
[50:03] you raise up
[50:05] your That's all true. Okay. Your name is
[50:08] lion. Adam could name the names because
[50:11] he had the book.
[50:14] Praise the Lord. He saw the names. The
[50:18] family of God. Amen. Brother, in the in
[50:21] the Garden of Eden, nobody could give
[50:24] Eve her identity. Eve could go to Mr.
[50:27] Elephant. Mr. Elephant, look, we are all
[50:29] here in the garden and it's so nice.
[50:31] It's so beautiful and but but what I'm
[50:33] doing here? And the elephant said, look,
[50:35] I'm man, we are really have a great
[50:36] time. It's just tremendous. Yeah. But
[50:38] but I don't know what we're doing. I
[50:39] don't know where we come from. The only
[50:41] one who could tell Eve where she came
[50:43] from was Adam. And you must understand
[50:47] no church could give us our identity.
[50:50] Though we had already our new birth.
[50:52] That's right. Sometime in denominations.
[50:55] Brother said the eagle was in it was
[50:57] already an eagle. Okay. I don't speak of
[50:59] today but the older generation we come
[51:01] out of churches. We cannot say we were
[51:03] we had a birth through Malachi 4. But
[51:06] this is that's another subject. But we
[51:07] were already quickened in that thing.
[51:09] Okay. Please don't get me on words. If
[51:11] not, I'm sidetracked with that question
[51:12] when No. No. But they had their place
[51:15] and they have their place. But the only
[51:17] one who can tell the bride where she
[51:20] came from and where she goes to is
[51:22] Christ himself. Hallelujah. Not even
[51:24] brother Brandham has a right. Brother,
[51:27] the great person in this generation is
[51:30] not William Brham. It's the Lord Jesus
[51:32] Christ. Amen. Therefore, we are not
[51:34] Brhamites.
[51:36] No, sir. We are not Brandham fans. We
[51:38] are not Brham cult. We are Christians.
[51:40] But we understand that brother Brandham
[51:42] was our messenger. Can you say amen? As
[51:46] every father is the head of his own
[51:47] home. Every pastor is the head of a
[51:50] local church. Amen. The messenger is the
[51:53] head of a church age and Christ is the
[51:55] head of all seven messengers.
[51:58] Brother Marcus, can somebody correct the
[52:00] prophet? Sure. God. Amen. God is God is
[52:04] God can correct who he wants. He is the
[52:06] head of every prophet. He does whatever
[52:08] he wants. Yes, sir. Can you say amen?
[52:10] Amen. Blessed be. Therefore, we have no
[52:13] message of ourself. Therefore, we are
[52:16] not interested in propagating our own
[52:19] ministry, our own tapes. I'm not in it.
[52:22] Amen. Though I know the world is the
[52:24] world, I will not change it. You see,
[52:26] but brother said there will be a
[52:29] people on this earth who will be the
[52:32] final voice of the final age under their
[52:35] messenger.
[52:36] [Applause]
[52:37] Can you say amen? Amen. So we understand
[52:41] that that that that here is the book and
[52:43] the names are in it and the book goes
[52:45] back in the hands of the owner and I was
[52:47] preaching it years ago about the self
[52:50] how God had to wait to give that book
[52:52] back to somebody. Okay. But we are
[52:54] following now the names the family of
[52:57] God. That means we are and I speak about
[53:01] the bride. I don't speak about people
[53:03] who get just saved. Okay? The bride. I
[53:07] want to ask you a question. You put on
[53:09] your spiritual jackets. Okay? Amen. Now,
[53:12] now when we talk about marriage, only
[53:15] the same species of people can marry.
[53:19] Amen. Only the same species. A dog can
[53:21] only marry a dog. Okay? A cat can only
[53:24] marry a dog. A a cat. A human being can
[53:27] only marry a human being. Okay. The rest
[53:30] would be sodomism. Whatever. Now my
[53:32] question to you is when God wants to
[53:35] marry, who can he marry?
[53:39] God cannot marry human beings. They can
[53:41] save them. But God can only marry God.
[53:45] The part that that went out of him is
[53:47] the one that he will get back into his
[53:49] bosom again. Amen. Brother, I tell you
[53:52] one thing. Nobody can preach you into
[53:53] the bride. And nobody can preach you out
[53:56] of the bride. We had this church would
[53:58] say if you leave us, you're out of the
[54:00] plan of God and you are this and you are
[54:01] that. I said look, I have a father. And
[54:04] my father placed eternity in my if I'm
[54:06] in this church or another church. Forget
[54:08] that thing of holding people by fear.
[54:11] Amen. Can you say amen? The the thunder
[54:13] movement was very very strong in those
[54:15] things. Look, here we go now. Here's
[54:17] here's here is Moses and Christ is
[54:19] portray portraying himself. Moses having
[54:23] a better idea than God. Okay, I'm not
[54:25] dealing with it. Okay, but we see that
[54:28] Moses when God wanted to kill or yeah
[54:32] destroy and you please forgive that my
[54:35] my my range of words is quite limited.
[54:38] He was just standing in the gap and
[54:40] brother that was Christ by the way.
[54:42] Brother Brham said Eve was not Adam was
[54:45] not deceived. Amen. No, he was not. He
[54:47] went open eyes into that thing. He was
[54:49] not deceived. But he used his own self.
[54:53] Yeah. Okay. So therefore, it was Christ
[54:56] in Adam redeeming his bride. Amen. Okay.
[55:00] Here is Christ in Moses. And and I'm and
[55:03] and and I trust that Moses had clear
[55:07] understanding about the book.
[55:09] Say, "Brother Marcus, if you preach
[55:11] these things without without stress and
[55:14] without putting the thumb on people and
[55:16] without putting pressure, how do you
[55:18] prevent the church to become worldly?" I
[55:21] said, "Look, they must have the Holy
[55:22] Ghost." Amen. And the Holy Ghost is the
[55:25] answer. The Holy Ghost will not become
[55:26] worthy. Can you say amen? But here, here
[55:29] he is. He must have known Yeah. that
[55:33] he's in the book because he comes to God
[55:36] in all boldness. And God loved that
[55:38] boldness. Yet now, if thou wilt forgive
[55:41] their sin, and if not, blot me, I pray
[55:44] you, out of the book which thou has
[55:46] written. And and and Moses must have
[55:48] known he cannot blot me out
[55:51] because God cannot forsake himself.
[55:54] Amen. It's a family affair. It's a royal
[55:57] family affair. Moses could stand before
[55:59] God because there is only one people who
[56:02] who there is people who will get eternal
[56:05] life. But there is people that are
[56:07] eternal life.
[56:10] Blessed be. And God loved that. He said,
[56:12] "That's exactly my son." You must
[56:14] imagine now here here is here is here is
[56:16] Elohim and he's speaking about the
[56:18] destruction of Sodom and so forth. And
[56:20] and Abraham said I I mean you couldn't
[56:22] you couldn't you you couldn't do that.
[56:24] Please don't. And and and and Elohim did
[56:26] as if he was a little bit offended. I
[56:28] mean who's the one talking? And in his
[56:29] heart he said that's my son. I love
[56:31] that. That is exactly my heart. Yeah,
[56:34] God loves to forgive. That's his nature.
[56:38] God loves to bless. Quote, brother
[56:41] Brandham, God loves to do things for his
[56:44] children.
[56:46] Quote, Brother Brandham, God wants to
[56:47] give you the Holy Ghost more than you
[56:49] want to receive it. Blessed be the name.
[56:52] That's his nature. Blessed be the name
[56:54] of the of the Lord. That's that's our
[56:56] father. Can you say amen? So, here we
[56:59] go. Now here's
[57:01] Jesus and he is on his on his way and
[57:06] okay. Amen. We will see this afternoon
[57:09] how we were all born with that kind of a
[57:12] trauma. Therefore, we forgot who we
[57:13] were. Okay. Amen. But let let me say
[57:16] this. We wanted to come directly into
[57:19] our theophony and we landed in Ohio
[57:24] in a body that we don't like. I wake up
[57:27] in the morning. I look in the mirror. I
[57:28] said look I don't know you but I wash
[57:30] you
[57:30] anyhow. Okay I sometime it's funny but
[57:34] some of the things is not funny because
[57:35] we come sometime from dysfunctional
[57:37] family like me I was a from a from from
[57:38] a broken family. Okay. Yeah. We came
[57:41] into it. Nobody when you came on your on
[57:43] the earth, nobody asked you, do you want
[57:44] to be male or female? Nobody asked you.
[57:47] You want to be black or white?
[57:49] Therefore, please understand, we're not
[57:51] talking to colors. We talk to
[57:52] theophanes. We talk to the inner man.
[57:55] Don't play that victim card with me.
[57:57] There because the bride doesn't have
[57:58] complexes because of color and racism.
[58:00] And so, the bride knows who she is. I am
[58:03] exactly the way my maker wants me to
[58:05] have. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[58:07] Can you say amen? Amen. Amen. So, so, so
[58:11] one thing is sure, when we think that we
[58:13] came wrong on this earth, be sure we
[58:14] will leave the right way. God will
[58:17] explain to us. Amen. By the way, my
[58:20] heart greetings to the Aaron family. We
[58:22] loved so much, brother Tim. And we were
[58:24] looking forward to see him again. Great
[58:26] shalom and and and the sister and and
[58:28] the family. Definitely. So, so you must
[58:31] understand now, here's Jesus. And
[58:34] remember, what happens to him will
[58:36] happen to the bride the same way.
[58:38] Hallelujah. Amen. Wherever it's written
[58:39] of Christ, you must see the brightest
[58:41] part of Christ. And he sits in the
[58:44] temple and he opens the book and what
[58:47] does he do? He finds himself.
[58:50] He finds himself. He said, "It is
[58:52] written of me."
[58:55] Okay. So when when when when he finds
[58:57] himself in that way, he closed the book.
[59:00] He said, "The old book is written of
[59:02] me." Praise God. Brother, you come to a
[59:04] place in your time where you find your
[59:07] name in the book.
[59:09] I've seen people healed. And I know
[59:13] there is a there is a there's a question
[59:14] of our mind and so forth and we have to
[59:16] deal with it. Amen.
[59:19] Amen. People consist of body, soul, and
[59:22] spirit. You have there's healing for all
[59:24] three of them. But the healing of the
[59:26] soul in reality is the revelation of who
[59:28] you are. Amen.
[59:30] Amen. And then we have healing. Brother
[59:32] William said God has many ways to heal.
[59:35] He heals by love. He leads by surgery.
[59:38] He heals by by by understanding. Okay?
[59:41] So please understand the way the time
[59:43] comes when you find yourself in the
[59:46] book. God allows it. You need it in
[59:48] order to go home. Now here's brother
[59:50] Brenon. Okay. Memphis, Tennessee. The
[59:53] plane is not uh is there is a there is a
[59:57] storm. He hears the voice go. And he
[59:59] just goes. And here is that mama. And I
[1:00:02] just called it mama just Okay. Brother
[1:00:04] said she hangs over the fence. Yeah.
[1:00:07] Okay. And brother Brandon passes by and
[1:00:09] she she says, "Hello, Parson." Yeah.
[1:00:11] Amen. He says, "How do you know that I'm
[1:00:13] a minister?" Look, God is in humor.
[1:00:16] Amen. Normally, it was brother Brandham
[1:00:18] revealing the people. Your name is Eva.
[1:00:21] I see you in a car accident. But that
[1:00:22] woman is now revealing Brother Brandham.
[1:00:25] She He does not know who she is, but she
[1:00:27] knows who he is. Amen. Understand?
[1:00:31] Amen. Amen. You're the prophet Elijah
[1:00:33] and I'm the Shunomite woman. But I tell
[1:00:36] you one thing to find brother Brandham
[1:00:38] in the Bible is not very difficult. But
[1:00:40] you must find yourself. She did not only
[1:00:43] say this is brother Benham, you are the
[1:00:45] prophet Elijah. He said you are the
[1:00:46] prophet Elijah and I am.
[1:00:50] Amen. That's all. Therefore, you read
[1:00:53] the book of Esther. He said that's me.
[1:00:55] Yes. Essa had no father and she had no
[1:00:58] mother. Types Melchazdc.
[1:01:01] Essa had two names. One was the American
[1:01:03] name. The other one was her eternal
[1:01:05] name. Eternal identification. Can you
[1:01:09] say amen? Blessed be the name. And
[1:01:11] that's the love of the father. Amen.
[1:01:14] That is God revealing himself to us. So
[1:01:17] we understand at the end of our life,
[1:01:19] I'm not the son of Charles and Ala
[1:01:21] Brenham. No. No. I am I come from God
[1:01:25] and I go back to God. This message
[1:01:28] really revealed our identity. So we
[1:01:30] understand this. Amen. We are the words
[1:01:34] that is in the book.
[1:01:36] Let me say it like this like brother
[1:01:38] said we are that book. Amen. Okay. Amen.
[1:01:42] So
[1:01:44] God and and and please take it the way I
[1:01:47] say I have no notes and if I'm not using
[1:01:50] the right words then you understand what
[1:01:52] I want to say. Amen.
[1:01:55] If she is the
[1:01:57] book then there is only one who take
[1:02:00] that book and that's that's the husband.
[1:02:04] Yes. Do you know one thing? The marriage
[1:02:08] covenant
[1:02:09] gives a lot of privileges. Yes, sir. To
[1:02:13] boys and girls. Praise the Lord. All you
[1:02:15] fathers and all you mothers. Amen. And
[1:02:17] please take it spiritually. I say
[1:02:19] spiritually and not I'm don't have a
[1:02:21] second thought. But at a certain age, we
[1:02:23] don't see our children naked anymore.
[1:02:26] And that's right. And that's good. It
[1:02:27] should be like this. But there will be
[1:02:29] someone who sees our children naked.
[1:02:32] That would be future husband, future
[1:02:34] wife. Amen. That only marriage covenant
[1:02:38] allows to see the other one naked.
[1:02:42] You got it. Amen. Take it to the
[1:02:44] spiritual. We're not talking now about
[1:02:45] about You see? Therefore, Brother Brham
[1:02:49] said there is a link between and you
[1:02:52] take it spiritually too. There's a link
[1:02:55] between the serpent seat and marriage
[1:02:57] and divorce. Amen. For sure. There's a
[1:03:00] link. Okay. Amen. And when and and when
[1:03:03] and when when when Abel brought as a
[1:03:05] sacrifice blood, it's because he
[1:03:09] understood what happened in the garden
[1:03:11] of Eden.
[1:03:13] So who was murdered in the garden of
[1:03:15] Eden? Nobody. But the first blood that
[1:03:18] was shed in the Garden of Eden was Eve.
[1:03:20] Eve.
[1:03:23] And we who are married, we know what
[1:03:24] it's what what it's about. Okay. The
[1:03:27] first veil that was broken in the Garden
[1:03:29] of Eden was was Eve. Amen. Amen. Blessed
[1:03:33] be the name. Therefore, I want to tell
[1:03:34] you the boys and the girls, it matters
[1:03:38] to stay holy. It matters to stay pure
[1:03:42] because God will bless your future
[1:03:43] marriage if you keep your body reserved
[1:03:46] for that marriage covenant. You have to
[1:03:49] do it by revelation. Amen. Amen. There's
[1:03:51] people in the church, they don't pay
[1:03:53] their tithings. It's not that that will
[1:03:55] uncchristianize them. They're good
[1:03:56] people, but there's something that they
[1:03:58] didn't understand that God would bless
[1:04:00] them more financially if they would just
[1:04:02] be faithful paying their tithing. And
[1:04:04] people who play around with their body,
[1:04:06] even digital form of showing certain we
[1:04:09] we we see it creeping up a little bit.
[1:04:12] It shows there is a lack of
[1:04:14] understanding that your body is holy
[1:04:17] and you're blessing already your future
[1:04:19] marriage by keeping your body just for
[1:04:21] the for your husband and for your wife.
[1:04:24] Amen. Even your parents don't have a a
[1:04:26] right to look at you. No. Amen. This is
[1:04:30] just between husband and wife. Tired to
[1:04:34] the spiritual. Amen. The only one who
[1:04:37] has a right to reveal himself and to
[1:04:40] reveal the bride is the bridegroom
[1:04:42] himself. Not even brother Brandham had a
[1:04:45] right. That's right. Not even Paul. You
[1:04:48] see now Paul looked behind the curtain
[1:04:51] of time and look what he says. And if
[1:04:54] you see that picture, you see very he
[1:04:56] saw things
[1:04:58] that he shouldn't see
[1:05:01] because that was the revelation that
[1:05:04] struck our time. And he says how that he
[1:05:07] was caught into paradise and heard
[1:05:09] unspeakable words which is not lawful
[1:05:12] for a man to utter.
[1:05:15] In other words, I I had the privilege of
[1:05:18] looking behind God's mystery, his bride,
[1:05:21] but I'm not allowed to even mention it.
[1:05:24] It's if you make a certain look into
[1:05:26] something that you shouldn't see. Yeah.
[1:05:29] Praise God. John could see, but he was
[1:05:31] forbidden to write something down about
[1:05:33] it. Um, and God says, "No, no, this is
[1:05:36] not for you, John. This is not for you,
[1:05:38] Paul. The revelation of my bride. The
[1:05:40] Let me say the nakedness of my Let me
[1:05:42] say in that word." Okay, you understand?
[1:05:44] Spiritually, please not. Okay. No, no,
[1:05:46] no immoral thought. This will be for me,
[1:05:49] for me myself. Not even brother Brandham
[1:05:52] had a right to reveal those things. It
[1:05:54] was Christ coming down.
[1:05:57] Amen. Yeah. Yes, sir. Revealing her
[1:05:59] revealing that is just between the
[1:06:01] bridegroom and the bride. She sees him
[1:06:04] like he is and he sees her like she is.
[1:06:07] You understand? All holy. Okay. Amen.
[1:06:09] Amen. So, what happens is this. Now
[1:06:12] watch when we are and this is only one
[1:06:15] aspect. This is not a teaching about the
[1:06:17] book of revelation because there is many
[1:06:19] aspects. I'm only following this
[1:06:21] morning. We are the words that's in the
[1:06:24] book. There's many many more things to
[1:06:26] reveal. Many many aspects. Amen. But
[1:06:29] when John says, "And I wept because no
[1:06:32] man was found worthy to open the book
[1:06:36] and read the book, neither to look
[1:06:38] thereon." Brother Bren said John John
[1:06:40] knew he was saved.
[1:06:43] Amen. Because John on the aisle of
[1:06:44] Patmas, he believed in Christ. Amen. He
[1:06:47] knew it was not that he fell in, but he
[1:06:49] he he if if nobody can take the book,
[1:06:53] Yeah. we will all go back to the atoms
[1:06:55] and to molecules that we were right
[1:06:57] before the foundation of the world.
[1:06:59] Okay. So, so if the when the lamb takes
[1:07:03] the
[1:07:04] book, I mean, it means he takes his wife
[1:07:08] Amen. Amen. And gives now his authority
[1:07:12] unto her. Amen. That happens in the book
[1:07:14] of Esther. Her word was his word. Amen.
[1:07:19] That's the third pull. Amen. I am the
[1:07:22] almighty God. And now you speak to the
[1:07:24] storm.
[1:07:26] Amen. It was God giving authority now to
[1:07:28] his to who? To his bride. Yes, sir. We
[1:07:31] don't talk. We sing we sing Amazing
[1:07:34] Grace, how sweet the sound that saved
[1:07:35] the wretch like me. That's fine. But
[1:07:37] that's not our story. That was the
[1:07:39] beginning of our story. This is now time
[1:07:42] of union. This is marriage of the lamb.
[1:07:45] This is the invisible union. This is
[1:07:47] adoption time. Amen. Can you say amen?
[1:07:50] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:07:54] Brother Blham said there is where the
[1:07:56] Pentecostal made their mistakes. They
[1:07:58] thought the new birth is the end. But
[1:08:00] please understand the new birth is the
[1:08:02] beginning of everything.
[1:08:05] You will never have an adoption if you
[1:08:07] don't have the Holy Ghost. We everyone
[1:08:09] needs our Pentecost. There don't don't
[1:08:12] believe that we're just burnt into and
[1:08:14] we are evol. No, no, no, no. We need our
[1:08:16] new birth.
[1:08:18] But don't stop there. Go and then grow
[1:08:21] into the full manifestation because God
[1:08:24] will not rapture a teenager.
[1:08:27] God will not God will not rapture a
[1:08:29] baby. So here he came and took the book
[1:08:33] out of the hand that sat on the throne.
[1:08:35] What does it man? Adam took his wife.
[1:08:38] Yeah.
[1:08:40] Hallelujah. Here comes. He takes the
[1:08:43] book and we are that book. What does he
[1:08:45] do? God takes us into his bosom. Amen.
[1:08:48] One of the aspects. Yeah.
[1:08:51] Look, there's only one, as I said, has
[1:08:54] only won the right to marry the queen of
[1:08:57] heavens, and that's the king of heaven.
[1:09:02] Amen. Okay. She has to say yes. How can
[1:09:05] you call that time? This is now the time
[1:09:07] of heavenly courtship.
[1:09:10] God is now courting his his her beloved.
[1:09:16] Now you remember they sung a new song.
[1:09:19] Thou art worthy to take the book and to
[1:09:21] open the seals thereof. Thou was slain
[1:09:24] has redeemed us to God by the blood of
[1:09:25] every kind. Now look at twofold thing.
[1:09:28] You remember that brother Brandon was in
[1:09:30] the question answers of the seals that
[1:09:32] he was misplacing that scripture and
[1:09:34] then he said oh okay okay something is
[1:09:36] wrong here is somebody sick and and
[1:09:38] because for God for the Holy Spirit must
[1:09:41] was this part of the scripture so
[1:09:44] important to place it right that's the
[1:09:46] bride that's the raptured saints what he
[1:09:48] says amen because what does the bride
[1:09:51] say you're the one who can marry me
[1:09:55] because first you paid the bride price.
[1:09:58] Yeah. But not only this, but second,
[1:10:02] what what what is what is what is
[1:10:04] the what is the basis of of of of of
[1:10:08] marriage? We ask the young
[1:10:11] people, he must be in the message. He
[1:10:15] must be he must be born again. Uh he
[1:10:18] must be a good man. He must come from a
[1:10:20] good home. He must work. He must that's
[1:10:22] all fine. But the foundation of
[1:10:24] everything must be true love. Amen.
[1:10:27] First of all, I'm drawn to that person.
[1:10:29] I love her. Yeah. I'm So, the boy has to
[1:10:32] do something. He doesn't come. Do you
[1:10:35] see my Mercedes?
[1:10:38] And I tell you one thing, I can preach.
[1:10:40] I can preach. I can tell the people.
[1:10:42] But, but love is more than just being in
[1:10:46] the message, being a good boy. Love is
[1:10:49] something that pulls your heart out of
[1:10:51] it. So, the bride says, "You are
[1:10:54] worthy." Not only do you paid the bride
[1:10:56] price, yeah, I mean, but you captured
[1:10:59] our hearts. Amen, brother. There is a
[1:11:02] bride in the land and she's only married
[1:11:04] to one, to the Lord Jesus Christ. Not to
[1:11:07] any church, not to any system.
[1:11:10] No, sir. We had to deal sometime with
[1:11:12] young people and and and a little bit
[1:11:15] out of a abusive situation. The only
[1:11:18] thing they said, "My church, my church,
[1:11:20] my church, my pastor, my church, my
[1:11:22] church, my church." And I said, "Look,
[1:11:24] boy, stop with that. I tell you one
[1:11:26] thing. Tell me first who your father
[1:11:27] is." Amen. Amen. Speak first about the
[1:11:30] Lord Jesus Christ and then we talk about
[1:11:32] the local church because our anchor is
[1:11:34] not William Bram. Our anchor is the Lord
[1:11:36] Jesus Christ.
[1:11:38] And then you find a local church. But ne
[1:11:40] never put put the the the wagon before
[1:11:42] the horses.
[1:11:45] Amen. You see, you understand so
[1:11:47] beautiful God in courtship.
[1:11:51] This marriage of the lamb is not an
[1:11:53] arranged marriage.
[1:11:55] It's not a forced marriage. Amen. God
[1:11:58] didn't say, "Okay, I paid for you so you
[1:12:00] have to." No, no, no. This bride so much
[1:12:03] loves the Lord Jesus. And she's she so
[1:12:06] much loves her.
[1:12:09] Amen. There she's the only one who can
[1:12:11] say, "Thou art worthy to take the book."
[1:12:14] And we are that book in that sense.
[1:12:16] There's a lot of there's a lot of
[1:12:17] explanation. Okay. Amen. Look how
[1:12:20] beautiful. Amen. If somebody leaves the
[1:12:22] church, never wipe him off. Never. I
[1:12:25] always say sometime people leave the
[1:12:27] church the good way, they leave the
[1:12:28] church the bad way. But the way we react
[1:12:30] on them, our youngsters observe it very
[1:12:32] clear. And they would see if our words
[1:12:35] have a certain credential or if it's
[1:12:37] just blah blah. We this message is not a
[1:12:40] sect, brother. It's a family.
[1:12:42] You know what the difference of a sect
[1:12:44] is? If you are, it is only defined by
[1:12:46] membership. If you are in the church,
[1:12:48] okay, brother Marcus, before the
[1:12:51] foundation of the world and my theophony
[1:12:53] stands beside your theophony and we were
[1:12:55] already and okay and then something
[1:12:57] happens to Marcus, not that he's just
[1:13:00] something happened, a great distress, a
[1:13:02] great depression, somebody that he fell
[1:13:04] in love and the girl doesn't want to
[1:13:07] anything like this and Marcus gives up
[1:13:09] for some time. Okay. He says, "Look, I'm
[1:13:11] I'm I'm I'm I'm just leaving that whole
[1:13:13] thing because of" and then the same
[1:13:14] people will say, "Yeah, to just to just
[1:13:17] to identify just to to excuse himself.
[1:13:20] You you must understand they left us
[1:13:21] because they were never part of us." You
[1:13:24] see, so Marcus after a couple of years
[1:13:26] and and he repented. He said, "Heavenly
[1:13:28] Father, please call me back." And I'm
[1:13:29] going back to the same same group. And
[1:13:31] then we say, "Oh, Marcus, wonderful.
[1:13:33] Before the foundation of the world, we
[1:13:35] were always, hey, who wants to believe
[1:13:37] that nonsense?" Yeah, brother. If we are
[1:13:39] if we are family of God, we stay family
[1:13:41] of God.
[1:13:43] Amen. Take away. I I I I remember I told
[1:13:45] one time my daughter, I said, "Honey, uh
[1:13:48] look, God put us together as a family
[1:13:51] and we are friends. Please understand
[1:13:53] when when you have a little child like
[1:13:55] this, when you have a car accident, on
[1:13:57] the other side, you have the same size
[1:13:58] of the offhony.
[1:14:00] Your children are your brothers and your
[1:14:02] sisters. That what we have have to
[1:14:03] understand." So I told my little honey I
[1:14:05] said I said look I want to tell you one
[1:14:07] thing that daddy loves you a lot. If you
[1:14:09] would leave the message, if you would
[1:14:11] become a Muslim, okay, amen. If you
[1:14:15] whatever you come with a bora and you
[1:14:17] only have something,
[1:14:19] that's up to you. That's your life. I'm
[1:14:21] not commanding your life. But one thing
[1:14:23] is sure, daddy will always be daddy. We
[1:14:26] are always friends. Because because our
[1:14:29] love is not conditioned of what you
[1:14:31] think, what you believe, where you are.
[1:14:33] Love is a is is a power. Brother, love
[1:14:36] is not a feeling. Love is a person. I
[1:14:39] said I might not agree with your
[1:14:41] lifestyle but I agree with your heart
[1:14:44] with your soul. I even mentioned the
[1:14:46] brother Paul about about homosexuality
[1:14:48] and so forth. We must pay a lot of
[1:14:50] attention of people of not agreeing with
[1:14:52] their lifestyle but agree with their
[1:14:54] soul. We're not helping people by
[1:14:56] despising them. They need help. Amen.
[1:14:58] They need Amen.
[1:15:01] Can you say amen, brother? In all these
[1:15:04] years that we're in the message, we
[1:15:05] never let down the the bars. Never. We
[1:15:07] don't have the same st but we lost we we
[1:15:10] had times when we were more spiritual
[1:15:11] like brother Brennham than brother
[1:15:13] Brandham but it was pure legalism and
[1:15:16] legalism brother is a is a dead end it
[1:15:19] leads into nothing it's it's ready to
[1:15:21] frustrate people if love holds up the
[1:15:26] standard sir can you say amen so he
[1:15:29] takes the book amen in other words the
[1:15:31] marriage of the lamb praise God he comes
[1:15:34] down it's not a seminary It's not okay.
[1:15:37] Um, uh, when the rapture comes, here
[1:15:39] comes that multiplechoice
[1:15:41] test. Who was the fourth
[1:15:45] messenger?
[1:15:47] Um, uh, Bonnie and Clyde. No, no, not
[1:15:50] Bonnie and Clyde. Okay. You see, it's a
[1:15:53] life. It's an attitude. It's a love
[1:15:57] affair. I'll tell you one thing. You
[1:15:59] come to a place where you cannot leave
[1:16:02] the message. There's no way. You say, I
[1:16:05] am the message. Sorry, but you're not
[1:16:07] despising them who just go. You just
[1:16:09] said, "Lord, help them. Give them grace,
[1:16:12] Father." Because let's be honest with
[1:16:14] one another. If God would not have kept
[1:16:16] us, we would be in all kind of
[1:16:18] immorality. But it was just the grace of
[1:16:20] God. Can you say amen? Amen. And God by
[1:16:24] his love, he breaks such a binding.
[1:16:27] Bondage, no bondage, not such a b uh
[1:16:30] bonding. Not bondage. Bonding. We were
[1:16:32] talking this afternoon about the bonding
[1:16:34] of father and son. You know when it
[1:16:36] comes nothing nothing nothing can
[1:16:38] separate you. Brother this message makes
[1:16:40] such a bonding to God. You cannot leave
[1:16:42] it. So brother Marcus what is your what
[1:16:45] is your what is your what is your
[1:16:46] doctrine? I have a
[1:16:50] father. He calls me his own long before
[1:16:56] even time began.
[1:16:59] My life was in his hand. Can you say
[1:17:04] amen? Amen. The lamb takes the book in
[1:17:07] again one aspect. There's a lot of
[1:17:09] aspects. I'm not as I told you before.
[1:17:12] But the lamb takes his bride
[1:17:14] because we are the words in that book.
[1:17:17] It's not an intellectual thing. I mean
[1:17:19] we dummies we understand it because love
[1:17:21] can be understood by everyone. Can you
[1:17:23] say amen? So we understand that when
[1:17:27] Revelation 10 comes, Amen. And that book
[1:17:31] now comes to the bride. Okay? And I went
[1:17:34] unto the angel and I said unto him, give
[1:17:36] me the little book. Amen. And he said
[1:17:38] unto me, take it, eat it up, and it
[1:17:40] shall make that belly better, bitter,
[1:17:42] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:17:44] honey. And I took the little book and of
[1:17:47] the angel's hand, and ate it up, and it
[1:17:49] was in my mouth sweet as honey. And as
[1:17:50] soon as I had eaten it up, my belly was
[1:17:52] bitter. And he said unto me, "Thou must
[1:17:55] prophesy again before many people and
[1:17:56] nations and tongues and kings." Look,
[1:18:00] when the bride takes the book, Amen.
[1:18:03] That means, or when she receives the
[1:18:05] book, in reality, we speak of a
[1:18:07] marriage. That's right.
[1:18:09] The book and her
[1:18:12] the book now comes to its final landing
[1:18:15] place. It's made for her because we are
[1:18:18] the words in that book. What does God
[1:18:20] do? What does the taking of the book
[1:18:22] means? the bride get her identification.
[1:18:25] Nobody could tell us who we were. Amen.
[1:18:28] But I know I made it already years ago.
[1:18:31] No prophet could look as far as William
[1:18:35] Brandon. Yeah. John could only say in
[1:18:38] the beginning. Amen. Moses could only
[1:18:40] say in the beginning. But this messenger
[1:18:43] could look way before the beginning.
[1:18:45] That's right. Yeah. And we need it that
[1:18:46] way. Amen.
[1:18:48] There was a name by the name of uh Bud
[1:18:51] Suswick and brother Bisll gave that that
[1:18:53] that that that little testimony. Bud
[1:18:55] Suswick was a was a was a believer and
[1:18:58] he was a secret smoker.
[1:19:00] Amen. So whenever he went to be with the
[1:19:03] horses, he was secretly smoking. Nobody
[1:19:06] knew about that. And he said, "And one
[1:19:07] day, brother Brian just laid in his
[1:19:09] tent. I came back to take care of the
[1:19:12] kitchen and so forth." And uh brother
[1:19:14] Brham said, "Hey, since how many years
[1:19:16] are you a Christian already?" And Buddy
[1:19:18] said, "Oh, Bud says, "Oh, brother, since
[1:19:20] many years." And after some minutes, he
[1:19:23] said, "And brother Brandham said, laying
[1:19:24] on his bed, but did you ever smoke when
[1:19:27] you were an unbeliever?" And B said,
[1:19:29] "Yes, brother, not
[1:19:31] more." And after some minutes, he said,
[1:19:34] and brother Brandham said, "But when did
[1:19:35] you stop
[1:19:37] smoking?" And B said, "Right now."
[1:19:41] That's what he says. And he said, "I
[1:19:43] knew that brother Brham saw me." We must
[1:19:46] understand, brother Brandham understood
[1:19:48] what happened in the garden of Eden
[1:19:49] because he saw the scenery and could it
[1:19:52] bring it back. So this prophet could go
[1:19:54] way before the logos in the days of the
[1:19:58] voice of the sevens in the mystery.
[1:20:01] Paul was forbidden to write it was
[1:20:02] unlawful. John said seal up. But in the
[1:20:05] days of the I show who I am. Brother, we
[1:20:08] are the first generation who understand
[1:20:10] God. Yeah, that's right. Therefore, we
[1:20:13] are not prowned into any fanaticism.
[1:20:15] That's right. Or radicalism
[1:20:18] or legalism. Amen. It is love from the
[1:20:22] beginning, love from and not love in
[1:20:24] worldliness because the Holy Ghost in us
[1:20:26] keeps us on the standard. Can you say
[1:20:28] amen? Amen. So, Revelation 10.
[1:20:32] Amen. The bride, the bride receives the
[1:20:36] book. Let me say she receives her true
[1:20:38] identity. Amen. Amen. Who gives her
[1:20:42] identity? The husband. Therefore,
[1:20:45] brother Bram said in the seventh seal, I
[1:20:47] don't call you church anymore. Call you
[1:20:49] bride. Only your husband can give you
[1:20:52] the identity. Only your husband can lift
[1:20:54] up the veil. That's what happened in our
[1:20:57] time. And here we are. There's no need,
[1:20:59] brother, to become arrogant because what
[1:21:02] we are, we are by God's grace. We are
[1:21:05] not better than the Baptist. Don't
[1:21:06] forget this. Not better than the
[1:21:07] Methodist. But what is our difference?
[1:21:09] The deep call it to the deep. Blessed be
[1:21:13] the name of the Lord. Amen. Amen. Here
[1:21:15] we go. Amen. Now that's why the rapture,
[1:21:18] the bride, the wise virgin, the called
[1:21:20] out, the four ordained, the elect. Why
[1:21:22] you businessmen wouldn't run your office
[1:21:24] like some people try to think that God
[1:21:26] runs his problem program halfhazard. God
[1:21:30] knew before the foundation of the world
[1:21:32] who would be saved and who would not be
[1:21:33] saved. By predestination, by
[1:21:35] fornowledge, he saw every member, put
[1:21:37] every name in the lamb's book of life
[1:21:39] before the church ever began. Jesus come
[1:21:42] to seek and save that which was on that
[1:21:45] book. He bought the book of redemption.
[1:21:48] Amen. Amen. It was lost and he redeemed
[1:21:52] us in all names. Was on that book. Was
[1:21:54] redeemed when he redeemed us. Amen. When
[1:21:57] he bought the book, he bought his bride.
[1:21:59] Amen. Bought it back. Can you say amen?
[1:22:02] Amen. Amen. We know that brother Bram
[1:22:05] says there is two dead ends. One is the
[1:22:10] Armenianism, okay? And one is the
[1:22:12] Calvinism. Brother Ram said there's
[1:22:14] there's a there's a truth in between.
[1:22:16] Amen. Don't go don't go on the extremes.
[1:22:19] Okay? Keep a balance. So here we
[1:22:22] go. I'm not looking in the audience
[1:22:24] right now, but I want to tell you one
[1:22:27] thing. This is a message family.
[1:22:31] This
[1:22:33] is how how does the Frenchman
[1:22:37] do? This is
[1:22:39] tremendous. Amen. I mean, not not only
[1:22:42] the girls, not only the girls are
[1:22:45] tremendous. I mean, with that kind of a
[1:22:47] but the boys, man, everybody has a tie
[1:22:49] on. Okay. I mean, this is the church, a
[1:22:56] church, a wonderful church. My problem
[1:22:58] is only this. They are nothing else than
[1:23:00] Baptists.
[1:23:02] It's a Baptist family. In other words,
[1:23:05] to produce a holy church, you don't need
[1:23:06] a message.
[1:23:09] You just need some holiness, some
[1:23:10] pressure. You just have to put that You
[1:23:13] don't need a message to pick some long
[1:23:15] hair and long dress and and and and
[1:23:17] young boys with ties. That's not the
[1:23:19] message. Holiness is part of the
[1:23:21] message, but it's not the heart of the
[1:23:22] message.
[1:23:24] Amen. You remember the holiness
[1:23:26] movement? Long and and I say it I say it
[1:23:28] honestly but there's a truth behind long
[1:23:30] hair long dress long faces. Amen.
[1:23:35] Long hair long dress long faces. There
[1:23:37] are people they are not happy brother.
[1:23:39] And and and and and and to think we are
[1:23:41] happy because we have longer is not the
[1:23:43] thing. This messy is a heart is God
[1:23:46] opens his heart to us. Can you say amen?
[1:23:51] Amen. Amen. Blessed be the name of the
[1:23:53] Lord. Amen. Here we go. We're back. I'm
[1:23:56] just speaking by inspiration. Have you
[1:23:57] ever thought how beautiful? I mean,
[1:24:00] Jesus portraying the gospel. The whole
[1:24:02] book is the revelation of Christ. Amen.
[1:24:05] And the bride. It's a love letter for
[1:24:07] the bride. Here's the prodigal son.
[1:24:09] Okay. And he wants to have his money.
[1:24:11] And he uses it for rioteous living.
[1:24:15] Amen. Okay. Was I correct? Not righteous
[1:24:17] living. Riotous living. Okay. Yeah. Yes.
[1:24:21] Let me say a little bit plain. He wasn't
[1:24:23] every red light district restricted
[1:24:24] there was.
[1:24:26] Don't don't be don't be don't don't
[1:24:29] Yeah. Be
[1:24:32] that was but when he came to a certain
[1:24:35] point God makes a miracle because the
[1:24:37] Bible says and the boy came to himself.
[1:24:41] Wasn't that there was no deacon coming.
[1:24:44] There was no preacher coming. God the
[1:24:46] boy came to himself. Almighty God calls
[1:24:49] him back.
[1:24:51] And what was the first revelation that
[1:24:53] he has? I have a father. He doesn't say
[1:24:56] I have a brother Brandham. I have I have
[1:24:58] a father and my father is a great man
[1:25:01] and my father will forgive me. Whatever
[1:25:03] comes my way, I have a father, brother.
[1:25:06] That's gospel.
[1:25:07] That's gospel. And the boy was not
[1:25:10] coming starch. Yeah, that's no no no. He
[1:25:12] was humbled. But his father so much
[1:25:14] loved him. He said, "Boy, I cannot deny
[1:25:16] you. You're part of me. Come on.
[1:25:19] Have you ever thought about the second
[1:25:21] boy? He was in a worse condition. Worst
[1:25:24] condition. Because he was he had working
[1:25:26] working ethics. Yeah. That comes from
[1:25:29] Protestantism. I I I looked it up a lot.
[1:25:31] I had a lot of time for the seven
[1:25:32] churches when we had COVID about church
[1:25:35] history. Now, where are the pilgrim
[1:25:37] fathers? And it's all respected. But
[1:25:39] brother, if if if if if we have a high
[1:25:42] moral standard, but if we connect it
[1:25:45] with an arrogant spirit, it would not
[1:25:47] help us a lot. Would not we must have a
[1:25:50] feeling for a dying world. We must give
[1:25:53] the young people time to find the Lord
[1:25:55] Jesus themselves. We cannot conform them
[1:25:58] into a brother. We live we live in a
[1:26:01] little village in us and an older
[1:26:03] sister, she was so she was so
[1:26:05] embarrassed because one of the girls
[1:26:06] left the mess or left left the church
[1:26:08] and he comes with blue hair. Blue hair.
[1:26:11] Brother Marcus, isn't that a shame? She
[1:26:13] was in our Sunday school and now she has
[1:26:15] blue hair. I said, "Sister, the girl is
[1:26:17] just honest. She's a sinner. She needs
[1:26:20] Christ. She's just honest. Blue hair or
[1:26:22] no blue hair, what's the heck?"
[1:26:24] He said, "But you have the Holy Ghost to
[1:26:26] take that situation under your control
[1:26:29] to pray and give a helping hand and say,
[1:26:31] Lord, you help me so much in my life.
[1:26:33] Why don't you help that young girl the
[1:26:35] same way and give a helping hand and
[1:26:37] embrace her and hug her and said, "Hey,
[1:26:38] you you're not in the in the best
[1:26:40] condition, but know one thing, we never
[1:26:42] forget you." Amen. Brother, I I tell you
[1:26:45] something from my life. I mentioned it
[1:26:46] years ago already. I'm I'm I'm sometime
[1:26:49] sometime young people they leave a
[1:26:51] church, whatever. Not only our own
[1:26:54] church, they leave the church and I have
[1:26:55] their WhatsApp and I'm not exaggerating
[1:26:58] but I speak about a tragic that we have
[1:26:59] in the message world. I I'm I'm writing
[1:27:02] them, brother so and so, how are you
[1:27:04] doing by WhatsApp? Nine out of or eight
[1:27:08] out of 10 they write back, "Brother
[1:27:09] Marcus, I wasn't in church on Sunday." I
[1:27:12] said, "Look, I understand I'm over 50,
[1:27:14] but I'm not as old as you think. I saw
[1:27:16] who was there and who is not there. So,
[1:27:18] so don't Okay. I said my question is how
[1:27:21] how are you doing? They write back next
[1:27:24] Sunday I'm back. It's it's hypocrisy
[1:27:26] anyhow because if somebody wants to come
[1:27:28] back he's there he doesn't tell come
[1:27:29] back but you see in the mind of these
[1:27:31] youngsters they think if the if a
[1:27:33] preacher contacts me the only question
[1:27:35] that he has where were you on Sunday and
[1:27:38] I said look that's not my question how
[1:27:40] are you doing can we do something for
[1:27:42] you because you were part of us and in
[1:27:45] our mind you are still part of us
[1:27:48] brother I was in one of the churches in
[1:27:49] the US and people have wonderful
[1:27:52] ideas and some of the churches they
[1:27:55] have. It depends a little bit on their
[1:27:56] on their church history. Some they they
[1:27:59] keep all the young people, some have a
[1:28:00] little bit of a trouble. I came into a
[1:28:02] into a fellowship room. It was full of
[1:28:05] pictures like 20 30 pictures
[1:28:08] um of of young people. And he said, "Who
[1:28:11] who who are these young people?" And the
[1:28:12] pastor told me this. He said, "Brother
[1:28:14] Marcus, they left the church in all
[1:28:16] these years." Okay? But we keep their
[1:28:18] picture up. Praise God. So that we show
[1:28:22] to them and to us they are still part of
[1:28:23] us and when they come back to the log we
[1:28:26] can take that picture because we now
[1:28:28] have the original sitting there.
[1:28:31] Brother never give up on people. Amen.
[1:28:34] God has the last answer last word in
[1:28:36] everything. Amen. Can you say amen?
[1:28:39] Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:28:41] So we understand. Amen. So here brother
[1:28:45] Bram said Amen. What what happened in
[1:28:47] our time the lamb takes the book. Amen.
[1:28:50] Amen. Christ takes his bride. It's a
[1:28:52] marriage. It's a spiritual union. Okay.
[1:28:54] Amen. Now, notice the light. You can see
[1:28:57] with your hands, yet it's part of the
[1:28:59] body. You can see with your ears, yet
[1:29:01] you can hear, but you can see with your
[1:29:03] nose, yet it smells. You can see with
[1:29:05] the lips, though it speaks. That was the
[1:29:07] Pentecostal age, but now it's the eye
[1:29:09] time, the seeing. Now, there isn't one
[1:29:13] moving faculty beyond the eyes. Is that
[1:29:15] right? The next is the intelligent which
[1:29:17] is Christ himself who controls the whole
[1:29:19] body. Look how beautiful. If you see my
[1:29:22] passport and the picture, you only see
[1:29:25] this.
[1:29:27] Okay? You don't see that part. Okay? My
[1:29:30] identity is this.
[1:29:32] Okay? Huh? So, so brother B makes it
[1:29:35] clear. I'm an uh mouth age. Pentecostal
[1:29:39] age. No. Where's the problem? Amen. Auza
[1:29:41] street. Is that the rest? No. God sent a
[1:29:44] prophet. His name is William Brham. Is
[1:29:46] this the end? No. Christ himself,
[1:29:49] the intelligence comes that we can think
[1:29:51] like God. Amen. Therefore, we are not
[1:29:54] Brandomites. The great person in this
[1:29:57] generation was not William Brandham. Is
[1:29:59] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:30:01] Can you say amen?
[1:30:03] Brother Brandon was the Eleaza ministry
[1:30:06] bringing us to that person. Have you
[1:30:08] ever thought about that? Here comes
[1:30:09] Eleaza and he goes into the house of
[1:30:11] Laban. Okay. And he has gifts like
[1:30:13] brother Brandon was invited for the for
[1:30:15] the for the uh for the denominations
[1:30:18] with his healing gift. And the Bible
[1:30:20] says and father got some money and gifts
[1:30:22] and mother got some money and gifts and
[1:30:24] the sisters got everybody got some money
[1:30:26] and gifts. But but but Rebecca was not
[1:30:28] interested in the money and the gifts.
[1:30:30] She was interested in the future husband
[1:30:33] in Eleaza in in in in Isaac. Okay. So
[1:30:36] they went though I want to say this
[1:30:38] clear. If you have I have a gift, use
[1:30:41] that gift for the glory and the honor of
[1:30:42] God. Where's the problem? If somebody
[1:30:44] has a gift, what? But never make the
[1:30:47] minor to the major and the major to the
[1:30:48] minor. Okay. Amen. So here's here's
[1:30:51] Rebecca again in the evening time of
[1:30:54] marriage. Amen. So they are both on
[1:30:56] their
[1:30:57] camels. Rebecca says, "I Eza, look uh
[1:31:02] you know a little bit my future husband.
[1:31:04] Can't you just uh explain me a little
[1:31:07] bit who I will marry? Amen. And Eleaza
[1:31:10] said, "No problem. Who is this
[1:31:12] MelzDC?" Amen. Uniting times and signs.
[1:31:15] I mean, Christ is the mystery of God
[1:31:17] revealed and all these preachings Eleaza
[1:31:21] revealed the nature of the future
[1:31:23] husband and she's so much in love. He's
[1:31:28] Have you ever seen the generation book?
[1:31:31] Yes. And have you ever seen the
[1:31:33] conclusion many times is not very
[1:31:35] spiritual. Okay. Hope I can say this.
[1:31:40] Okay. But you can see let me say no that
[1:31:43] was not the wrong word. Please forgive
[1:31:44] me. Let me say like this. I don't
[1:31:46] agree with many of their conclusions.
[1:31:49] That is better to say. I don't agree
[1:31:50] with it. No, I don't believe that
[1:31:51] brother Brandon will come back. No,
[1:31:53] don't agree with that. But you could see
[1:31:56] how these people loved William Brham.
[1:32:00] how they were so impressed about the
[1:32:02] nature, the man, the character. But I
[1:32:07] say this, if Eleaza was such a wonderful
[1:32:10] type of a person, if brother Brandon was
[1:32:12] such a wonderful type of a person, what
[1:32:14] about the Lord Jesus Christ?
[1:32:17] Brother, it will be a pleasure to go
[1:32:19] into the rapture. Will be a pleasure to
[1:32:21] meet him one day and say, "You are so
[1:32:23] much love."
[1:32:26] Can you say amen? Amen. A person one
[1:32:29] time said, "You remember brother Ramy
[1:32:31] had a little bit of his complexes? You
[1:32:33] see him standing right before beside
[1:32:35] Orura Roberts and you can see he had a
[1:32:36] little bit of a minority complex." Amen.
[1:32:39] Okay. Had a had a bad English. Okay. Was
[1:32:42] just a short man. Amen. And and and a
[1:32:45] brother said one time, "You must
[1:32:46] understand, brother Marcus, Eleaza was
[1:32:48] not a handsome man because God made sure
[1:32:51] that Rebecca does not fall in love with
[1:32:53] Eleaza."
[1:32:55] Amen. Okay. And there's too much message
[1:32:57] believers. They want to marry Eleazar.
[1:33:00] But you must marry Christ, which is the
[1:33:02] word
[1:33:03] in the evening time. What is it? Tent
[1:33:06] vision. Yes. They were meeting in the
[1:33:08] tent of their mother again. Amen. So
[1:33:11] much loving one another. Can you say
[1:33:13] amen? Amen. It's a special time. It's
[1:33:16] not the time of just amen. Look what
[1:33:18] brother said. Look, Christ in you makes
[1:33:22] him the center of life of the
[1:33:24] revelation. That's right. Christ's life
[1:33:26] in you makes him the center of the
[1:33:28] revelation. Christ in the Bible makes
[1:33:31] the Bible a complete revelation of
[1:33:33] Christ. Christ in you makes you the
[1:33:36] complete revelation of the whole thing.
[1:33:38] See what God is trying to do. And we
[1:33:41] continue but I will not continue because
[1:33:43] then it's a question of the new birth.
[1:33:45] Show me your wife and I show you what
[1:33:48] type of person you are. Show me your
[1:33:50] husband, I show you what type of person
[1:33:52] you are. Amen. That means we are the
[1:33:56] reflection. We are the revelation of
[1:33:59] what Christ wants to be or is. Can you
[1:34:03] say amen? Amen. Amen. So here we go.
[1:34:07] That was a very weak amen. Did you all
[1:34:09] marry the wrong partner or what?
[1:34:15] Amen. But brother Chad said amen. That
[1:34:17] was very important when the pastor said
[1:34:19] amen. Look how beautiful brother. This
[1:34:22] message you this message is not a
[1:34:24] doctrine. No, you must paint a picture.
[1:34:27] You must paint a p and then you see, oh,
[1:34:29] how can I leave that place? No way for
[1:34:32] us to go. We are we have humanity. We
[1:34:36] have human human tensions among us,
[1:34:38] brother. That's normal. Come on. Okay.
[1:34:42] It's nothing nicer than to be a just a
[1:34:44] guest minister. Wherever I go, you're
[1:34:45] the man of the hour. You come this guy
[1:34:47] and and then you go and say shalom.
[1:34:49] Okay. Take care. See you next year. But
[1:34:52] don't you don't you think that people
[1:34:54] are in Bizburg are offended of me? Sure.
[1:34:56] I mean that's that's the human part. I
[1:34:58] always said a person said to me,
[1:35:00] "Brother, brother Marcus, it's very
[1:35:01] difficult to get along with you." I
[1:35:04] said, "You only see me twice a week, but
[1:35:06] I have to deal with me all the day long,
[1:35:08] seven days a week. So pray for
[1:35:12] me." But look how beautiful. Look how be
[1:35:15] so don't brother if you see this how God
[1:35:17] in reality is orchestring everything.
[1:35:20] You have patience with yourself.
[1:35:22] Brother, if you become older in life,
[1:35:24] you will understand one thing. If God
[1:35:26] doesn't change the situation, nobody
[1:35:28] will change it. When we were younger, we
[1:35:31] were trying to change people unless No,
[1:35:32] no, no. You must wait upon God. And
[1:35:35] patience is a great treasure because we
[1:35:39] can do things too fast, too early. You
[1:35:41] just have to I must understand these
[1:35:44] people. I I don't own these people. They
[1:35:47] are God's children. I'm just a brother
[1:35:49] and a sister. Okay. So, here we go.
[1:35:52] Brother Brandon, the new the new church.
[1:35:55] You might have wondered a few minutes
[1:35:57] ago why I was so long coming out. My
[1:36:00] first duty as I come into the new
[1:36:03] church. I married a young man and woman
[1:36:06] standing in the office. May it be a type
[1:36:09] that I will be a loyal minister to
[1:36:12] Christ together, bride, ready for the
[1:36:14] ceremonies of that day. Here we are.
[1:36:18] Brother Brham, just as the heavenly
[1:36:20] marriage officer, he said, and what does
[1:36:22] he say? What God puts together, what God
[1:36:27] puts together, Christ and the bride, God
[1:36:30] can only marry himself. Amen. Nobody can
[1:36:33] put us under. Amen. Nobody can preach
[1:36:36] you out of that covenant. Nobody can
[1:36:38] preach you into it. Amen. It's this is
[1:36:41] God's grace. Amen. Can you say amen? So,
[1:36:44] here's brother Brandon. I'll finish you
[1:36:46] by. Amen. How beautiful. Hallelujah.
[1:36:50] This message is not a doctrine. Young
[1:36:53] people, don't be frustrated if you don't
[1:36:55] bring everything together.
[1:36:57] We do not bring neither everything. We
[1:37:00] only do as if. Amen.
[1:37:04] We we preach mighty sermons, but if you
[1:37:06] ask a little
[1:37:07] bit what you see, wait. Don't be
[1:37:10] frustrated, but be faithful in things
[1:37:13] that you see already. Amen. Yeah,
[1:37:15] brother. We came out of a situation
[1:37:17] where we always said black or white,
[1:37:19] 100% or nothing. But we found out people
[1:37:22] cannot live that standard. Today I say
[1:37:24] look, if you can give 10% to the Lord
[1:37:26] Jesus, the only thing you have your
[1:37:28] television at home, but you come to
[1:37:30] church, take that 10%. And serve the
[1:37:32] Lord Jesus with that 10% and God will
[1:37:36] multiply that little bread. Before we
[1:37:38] were okay, if it's not perfect, you have
[1:37:40] to go and and then everybody
[1:37:42] went then everybody went and so we have
[1:37:45] to now try to find them back say yeah I
[1:37:47] mean there is a way and Jesus is the way
[1:37:49] and you must yeah but why did you say
[1:37:50] that way? Yeah, we you must understand
[1:37:52] it's bright age and
[1:37:54] um but but God is forming us step by
[1:37:59] step taking things out of us. A person
[1:38:02] said, "Brother Marcus, I'm a little bit
[1:38:03] too world." Yeah, I understand that.
[1:38:04] What's the problem? God will you just
[1:38:07] continue. Let that inner man grow and
[1:38:09] things will just leave you. Amen. Can
[1:38:11] you say amen? But this message is a is a
[1:38:15] relationship between God and his
[1:38:16] children. Look, here's brother Glenn. Um
[1:38:19] the storm is is is is uh is calmed.
[1:38:22] Okay. He comes
[1:38:24] down the mountain. Okay. And then he
[1:38:28] hears a voice. You know what that voice
[1:38:30] said? For the first time in thousand
[1:38:32] years, God says, "Why don't you walk
[1:38:35] with me?"
[1:38:37] For the first time, God says, God
[1:38:40] doesn't want to have Muslimic worship.
[1:38:42] Okay, let me say imagine you come you
[1:38:45] come you you come home, okay, and your
[1:38:47] children all kneel on the floor, father
[1:38:50] is home, father is home, we can go to
[1:38:53] Amazon because he brings money back
[1:38:55] home.
[1:38:57] We we we we we pray God you are so
[1:39:00] great. God is not a narcissist. Yeah.
[1:39:02] God is not a narcissist. He know he says
[1:39:04] there's nobody beside me anyhow. Yeah.
[1:39:07] Do you think we can make God great by
[1:39:08] some words? Amen. But God wants
[1:39:11] affection. He wants love. You know, you
[1:39:14] want your children to just hug you.
[1:39:16] Daddy is home. Blessed be the name of
[1:39:18] the Lord. When you come to church, don't
[1:39:20] go in brother Chad's church. Come into
[1:39:21] the house of your father.
[1:39:24] Amen. Can you say amen? Brother, have
[1:39:27] you ever seen that it was on a
[1:39:28] Wednesday, it was my own testimony and
[1:39:30] you really really really doing bad.
[1:39:33] Amen. And and we hear them certain
[1:39:36] voices, let me call it uh thoughts,
[1:39:39] okay? uh which says uh in that condition
[1:39:42] you cannot go to church. No, no, no, no.
[1:39:44] You you better stay today at home.
[1:39:46] You're not a blessing like this. You
[1:39:48] stay home. Have you ever heard that
[1:39:49] voice, that thought? In other words, it
[1:39:51] speaks English and German.
[1:39:54] I hear it in German. You hear it in
[1:39:55] English. But I I want to tell you this.
[1:39:58] If Satan tells you to stay home, you
[1:39:59] tell Satan, you stay home, man. Because
[1:40:02] you're not becoming more spiritual by
[1:40:04] staying home. Come in the house of God.
[1:40:06] He says, "Heavenly Father, here I am.
[1:40:08] Everything went wrong and I did c I
[1:40:10] looked things that was not right. I did
[1:40:11] things but here is here I am. Please
[1:40:14] help me. God loves this. He wants to be
[1:40:16] a father. Amen. Can you say amen?
[1:40:20] Have you ever walked Have you ever
[1:40:22] thought about this? Here's brother
[1:40:23] Brandon. None of the messengers had the
[1:40:26] authority like brother William Brandon.
[1:40:28] There was two. They were special. Paul
[1:40:30] laid the foundation. Brother Brandon
[1:40:31] brought the capstone. Amen. Brother
[1:40:33] Brandon was the only one who could say,
[1:40:34] "I now go into a room and take every
[1:40:36] spirit under the control for the honor
[1:40:38] and the glory of God." But he himself
[1:40:41] believed a lie. He he passes by Oral
[1:40:43] Roberts University and he sees that
[1:40:45] great stature and he says he has 200
[1:40:49] secretaries and I have only one
[1:40:50] typewriter. And brother Ram said, "I
[1:40:52] felt sorry for myself. I started
[1:40:54] crying." Amen. And the devil told him,
[1:40:56] "Look, God could not never trust your
[1:40:58] money." I mean, here's a man who takes
[1:41:00] every spirit under his control. The
[1:41:02] voice says to brother Abraham, "Your
[1:41:04] ministry is higher than the ministry of
[1:41:06] all the Old Testament prophets. You know
[1:41:08] of greater things." And he believes the
[1:41:10] lie of the devil. And then God comes on
[1:41:12] the scene. He says, "Look up. I'm your
[1:41:15] portion.
[1:41:17] That's the reason we come to church. Not
[1:41:19] to hear about new I mean, look up.
[1:41:24] Amen. I am your portion." Amen. Nobody
[1:41:27] who no matter who the next president is,
[1:41:29] next pope, whatever. I am your portion.
[1:41:32] Can you say amen? So you wake up in the
[1:41:34] morning and you have strange
[1:41:36] thoughts. Very strange thought. I'm I'm
[1:41:39] not the only one. You too. Because you
[1:41:42] must understand that you live in a
[1:41:44] psychological warfare.
[1:41:46] You must understand that you cannot
[1:41:48] trust your own thoughts. And I cannot
[1:41:50] trust my own thoughts. You have to wash
[1:41:52] your face and then you say take every
[1:41:54] spirit under my control for the glory
[1:41:56] and the honor of God. Amen. Can you say
[1:41:59] amen? Amen. So God in thousands of time
[1:42:02] he just demand demanded obedience.
[1:42:06] That's what the holiness movement
[1:42:08] holiness movement can bring you
[1:42:09] obedience. They work a lot of pressure.
[1:42:12] Amen. It could be the last time and all.
[1:42:14] Oh we all didn't. I mean Amen. They they
[1:42:17] we we saw that kind of of Jimmy
[1:42:20] Swagger on this side. I see marriage
[1:42:24] problems. I mean if you have 20
[1:42:30] marriages okay
[1:42:35] decide I see heart problems. I mean if
[1:42:38] you're watching Tik Tok seven hours per
[1:42:40] day what going to McDonald's not making
[1:42:42] exercises. Okay there's not a question
[1:42:44] about that. your cholesterol goes up.
[1:42:46] You know, I don't have to be a prophet
[1:42:47] to see that. Okay? But they work with
[1:42:50] fear. They work with if you don't do
[1:42:53] this, you miss the rapture. But the
[1:42:55] bride says, "I am the rapture." I am.
[1:42:59] The rapture is a person and is an event.
[1:43:02] The the the resurrection was a person
[1:43:04] and event. Jesus said, "I am the
[1:43:06] resurrection." I think I think it was
[1:43:08] one time it was it was Tony Up. I hope
[1:43:09] I'm not quoting him wrong. It's in my
[1:43:11] mind. It was
[1:43:12] him going to the airplane somewhere in
[1:43:14] Canada and he was just running on the
[1:43:16] and and he was too late. It was already
[1:43:18] boarding time. He
[1:43:20] was and he was a man just going and walk
[1:43:22] normally beside him and Tony said, "Yes,
[1:43:24] but but you must understand we must the
[1:43:26] flight to Calgary or whatever. I missed
[1:43:28] my flight and we have to" and the man
[1:43:29] said, "No, you get your flight." I mean,
[1:43:31] yeah, but but it's already boarding
[1:43:32] time. We are too late. And the man just
[1:43:34] said, "No, you get your flight. I'm the
[1:43:35] pilot." Yes,
[1:43:38] brother. You must understand the bride
[1:43:40] cannot miss the rapture. Cannot cannot.
[1:43:43] Cannot. But you say, "Brother Marcus, if
[1:43:45] you preach that we become worldly." No,
[1:43:46] you have the Holy Ghost. And the Holy
[1:43:48] Ghost will not allow that you become
[1:43:50] worldly. But one if God is not
[1:43:52] interested in our bio rhythm. That's
[1:43:55] right. Because sometime we feel saved
[1:43:57] and sometime we feel very much saved.
[1:44:00] And if we performed performed three days
[1:44:03] well, we think we're the bride.
[1:44:07] I give you I give you a little I give
[1:44:08] you a little little little illustration.
[1:44:10] I want to be honest with you this
[1:44:11] morning. Can you say amen so far? I want
[1:44:13] to be honest with you. Everybody thinks
[1:44:16] look if we have a million message
[1:44:18] believers and brother Ram said it will
[1:44:20] be only a few. So how will God choose
[1:44:22] out of all the message to to make it?
[1:44:25] And and and I saw my own family and we
[1:44:28] always are at church. We're three times
[1:44:29] a service a week and most of the people
[1:44:32] just come on Sunday or depends on the
[1:44:34] distance a little bit. Okay. But we are
[1:44:36] always there. So I thought by myself,
[1:44:38] look, in comparison to
[1:44:41] others, it's good. Honest. Honest. I was
[1:44:45] a young man and I had a lot of I had a
[1:44:47] lot of banana in my head. I tell you, a
[1:44:49] lot of banana. But by God's grace, we
[1:44:52] now think twice. Okay. Amen. Amen.
[1:44:56] And one day I was in Paris and uh there
[1:45:00] was brother
[1:45:00] Mosaka and we had the morning service
[1:45:03] and then we wanted to go to eat and for
[1:45:05] the afternoon service and just to eat.
[1:45:06] And then was his his his wife sitting in
[1:45:09] the first row and just praying like
[1:45:11] this. I said, "Brother Mosaka, let's
[1:45:13] take your wife and then we go eating. We
[1:45:16] have the second service late in the
[1:45:17] afternoon." in my and he said to me,
[1:45:18] "No, no, she is sitting there and
[1:45:21] waiting and praying for this evening
[1:45:23] service all day, all all four, five
[1:45:25] hours without standing up." And I said,
[1:45:27] "Okay." And in that moment, I thought,
[1:45:30] "Okay, if she and me, if God counts just
[1:45:35] the prayer
[1:45:36] hours, Marcus has no chance to make it."
[1:45:40] You see what carnal comparison means?
[1:45:43] Amen. Amen. Can you say amen? Yeah.
[1:45:46] Amen. So it must be the bride. She is
[1:45:49] the rapture. Blessed be the name of the
[1:45:52] Lord. So here we go. For the first time,
[1:45:54] God does not want obedience. He wants
[1:45:58] fellowship.
[1:46:00] Amen. Amen. God wants love. Yeah. You
[1:46:04] say they must obedience is is part of
[1:46:06] love. Come on. Amen. Faithfulness,
[1:46:08] integrity, loyalty, everything is part
[1:46:11] of love. But you can do it with
[1:46:12] legalism. But God is not searching
[1:46:14] legal. God wants love. Amen. Amen. To
[1:46:17] come into the house of the Lord to dress
[1:46:19] like a real believer to honor God even
[1:46:21] by your dressings. A young girl, I tell
[1:46:24] you one thing, you keep your body clean.
[1:46:25] God is honoring that. You honor God and
[1:46:28] God honors you. Yeah. Can you say amen?
[1:46:30] If the musicians would come, brother, we
[1:46:32] are the we are the words in the book.
[1:46:34] This was only for the bride. Amen. Amen.
[1:46:37] The rest there is a there's a class of
[1:46:40] people. They will get salvation. they
[1:46:41] will get re
[1:46:43] uh uh eternal life according to my
[1:46:46] understanding. I hope you see it the
[1:46:48] same way. Don't wipe off Yeah. a sick
[1:46:52] world. They need Jesus. Amen. Jesus is
[1:46:55] the way. You say they don't come to a
[1:46:56] message church. Yeah. But I mean,
[1:46:58] brother Blair said this. He speaks of
[1:47:00] Abraham who is a thousand dollars or one
[1:47:02] one silver dollar and Lot he's just some
[1:47:05] pennies. Amen. Amen. And then brother
[1:47:08] Bham said this quote brother Brandham
[1:47:10] God sometime uses these pennies
[1:47:13] quote brother Brham everything that
[1:47:16] served God's purpose will have a
[1:47:18] resurrection. Amen. Let your neighbor
[1:47:20] who he is he does good well to you. God
[1:47:22] bless you. Amen. I made I made a little
[1:47:25] experience in my own life because we
[1:47:26] were we were thinking quite mind. I mean
[1:47:28] everything outside of the message is
[1:47:30] just saw dust. just I mean we were we we
[1:47:34] all love Israel especially my pastor and
[1:47:36] me and we were there and uh and we were
[1:47:40] uh I was the janitor for the community
[1:47:43] and so there was the Protestant church
[1:47:46] which made a little how do you call it a
[1:47:48] presentation about Israel okay so here
[1:47:52] was I and I said okay Protestant church
[1:47:55] yeah these unbelieving cane movement let
[1:47:58] them I was really sitting like that
[1:48:00] that's yeah yeah yeah Okay, it's my job
[1:48:02] and I hope
[1:48:03] that and he was presenting a book about
[1:48:06] the Jews in the in the black forest and
[1:48:08] I thought by myself I would like to buy
[1:48:10] that book but I looked no money with me.
[1:48:14] Ah, that's so sad. Okay, so everything
[1:48:17] is over and I shut down the lights and
[1:48:19] that man came to me. He said, "Mr.
[1:48:21] Becca, I felt on my heart to give you
[1:48:23] that book as a little present." And I
[1:48:26] was and I said, "God bless you." What
[1:48:28] should I say? God bless you. Thank you
[1:48:30] very much. The Lord be with you. God
[1:48:31] bless you. Come on. These people have a
[1:48:33] soul. These people have feelings. Amen.
[1:48:36] This message did not make us arrogant.
[1:48:39] This message gave us a feeling for a
[1:48:41] dying world. The Lord, is there still
[1:48:43] one? Is there a neighbor? Can I be a
[1:48:45] light for my neighbor? Can I be a a
[1:48:47] helpful hand for my neighbor? Can you
[1:48:49] say amen? Somebody leaves the message.
[1:48:51] Some of the people who left the message
[1:48:52] never left the message. They left the
[1:48:54] fanaticism in the message. The Brandham
[1:48:56] cult that they left, but they never left
[1:48:58] the message. Once you unle once once you
[1:49:00] are in the message you are in the Lord
[1:49:02] Jesus Christ. Have you ever thought
[1:49:05] about this how beautiful and finishing
[1:49:07] by that I want to first go to Esther but
[1:49:10] then I thought this is very beautiful.
[1:49:11] Have you ever thought about what I was
[1:49:13] preaching Paul said into Hebrew those
[1:49:16] who those he who sanctifies and those
[1:49:19] who sanctified are both coming from one.
[1:49:24] We come from the same for source as
[1:49:26] Jesus Christ. Amen. That's right. Amen.
[1:49:28] Amen. Therefore, he's our father, our
[1:49:30] brother, our sister, our mother. We are
[1:49:33] the female part of him.
[1:49:35] Coming from the same father, nobody can
[1:49:38] preach you into that family. Amen. So,
[1:49:40] here is David. And David, he Amen. In in
[1:49:43] our little story, he was so, let me say,
[1:49:45] he was so distressed. Brother Brian
[1:49:48] preaches about the man uh around David,
[1:49:50] this this mighty men. Amen. Uh
[1:49:54] warriors, fighters.
[1:49:58] Ah, amen. Fighters. Brother Bram said,
[1:50:01] quote, brother Bram, they did not know
[1:50:03] what fear was. They did not know that.
[1:50:07] Therefore, I always tell the young
[1:50:08] people, brother, to be masculine doesn't
[1:50:10] mean to be brute. You can show empathy.
[1:50:12] You can show love. You can show feeling
[1:50:14] that masculine is dead. Bas is not
[1:50:16] brute.
[1:50:18] So, they didn't know what fear was.
[1:50:20] Okay? And David just said, "If I would
[1:50:25] just have a uh a a little drink from the
[1:50:29] well in Bethlehem." And brother Brandham
[1:50:31] said this. Quote, "Brother
[1:50:33] Brandham, the least of the wishes of
[1:50:36] David were command for these men."
[1:50:40] They and then he said it because they
[1:50:41] were so much in love with David. Amen.
[1:50:44] So much they love. Okay. So they went
[1:50:48] out, okay, and went through that
[1:50:50] Philistine land, okay, brought it back
[1:50:54] after 14 miles. I mean, and David was so
[1:50:57] pleased to see that love affair between
[1:51:00] both. It was not a command. I mean, the
[1:51:03] church in denomination, they commanded.
[1:51:05] Everything was commanded and if you
[1:51:07] don't follow, we will have a okay, at
[1:51:08] the end, they will just put you out. But
[1:51:10] this message is different. It must be a
[1:51:12] love affair between Christ and the
[1:51:15] bride. Everybody finds his place. Every
[1:51:17] you learn to respect your brother
[1:51:19] because you see the Holy Spirit is part
[1:51:20] in him. Amen. Definitely. So you you
[1:51:23] respect older people because you now
[1:51:26] understand what life they lived for the
[1:51:28] message of the hour. We're not impressed
[1:51:30] who's the best preacher, who can perform
[1:51:32] the best, who can sing the best. You see
[1:51:34] the quality in a person's life. And by
[1:51:37] the way, older people, that is your
[1:51:38] dignity. If you if you're really matured
[1:51:41] in the Lord, nobody has to clap you on
[1:51:43] your shoulder. You know who you are.
[1:51:45] Amen. You find your name in the book. If
[1:51:47] somebody sees it or not, you know who
[1:51:49] you are. Amen. Blessed be the name of
[1:51:52] the Lord. It's a great It's a It's a I
[1:51:53] want to say this. I'm not an old person
[1:51:55] yet, but it's a treasure to become
[1:51:57] older. Amen. Amen. We can color our
[1:52:00] hairs. We can do whatever we want.
[1:52:02] That's not the problem. But if we become
[1:52:03] not only gray or old in the message, let
[1:52:06] us become mature in the message. It's a
[1:52:09] pleasure to become older. Because when
[1:52:10] we were younger, we talked really
[1:52:12] banana. Yeah. But now we think even our
[1:52:15] teaching was sometime now we just throw
[1:52:16] it out just because it it sounded nice
[1:52:20] not knowing what was the effect of all
[1:52:21] these things and it's oh
[1:52:26] I remember one thing the wisdom of of of
[1:52:27] of and I will not go into it not at all
[1:52:31] as I said but there was brother Bisll in
[1:52:33] all his wisdom I mean all the ministers
[1:52:35] from Europe were together asked brother
[1:52:38] Bisll did the lamb leave the mercy
[1:52:40] seat I mean if you want to make a bump
[1:52:43] to explode, you bring this in. Okay? If
[1:52:45] you want to make a bomb because we came
[1:52:47] out of these things of the 80s and the
[1:52:49] 90s and nobody is say oh we came out of
[1:52:51] these things not me but the people and
[1:52:54] he and I thought by myself what will he
[1:52:55] say whatever he says is now wrong and he
[1:52:57] says look I mean all this wisdom he says
[1:53:00] do you think that God changed his nature
[1:53:02] after the opening of the seals? God is
[1:53:05] always love but it depends on who has
[1:53:08] now entry or access to the throne of
[1:53:11] man. That is the question. And I thought
[1:53:13] now I understood why he is a worldwide
[1:53:15] minister and while Marcus Becker is just
[1:53:16] a hillbilly that nobody
[1:53:18] know because you need because whatever
[1:53:21] you would say it would have been a bomb
[1:53:22] to explode. It would have flit the
[1:53:23] church and he was so wise to say look it
[1:53:26] is a complex question which cannot be
[1:53:29] answered in just one or two verses. I
[1:53:31] thought by myself Marcus you have to
[1:53:32] learn a lot of things. Can you say amen?
[1:53:35] Amen. Amen. Yeah. You say amen that
[1:53:37] Marcus has to learn a lot of things. I
[1:53:39] realize that. But I I agree with you. We
[1:53:42] we are one in that.
[1:53:44] Okay. But brother, we I I tell you one
[1:53:47] thing. I want to be honest with you. I
[1:53:49] know now over 30 years. I think I
[1:53:51] minister. I'm so happy that there was no
[1:53:53] YouTube when I was a young
[1:53:57] minister because today we think twice.
[1:54:00] What will be the effects? I'm a of if I
[1:54:03] say a certain so I understand my slogan
[1:54:04] but will the other part of will they
[1:54:06] understand what I said or will it cause
[1:54:08] changes therefore today we we think
[1:54:10] twice how can you put it into words that
[1:54:12] there is no question amen so there was
[1:54:15] such a love between David and his men
[1:54:18] and that's the situation of Christ and
[1:54:20] the brides she loves him so much brother
[1:54:24] I I hope I'm not I'm I'm not too
[1:54:26] childish behind the pulpit you know but
[1:54:28] it's it's not that thing of working
[1:54:30] people up in the in the church, you must
[1:54:32] be in the church. You must be spiritual.
[1:54:34] But you must be spiritual at home at the
[1:54:36] same time. When you are in your forest,
[1:54:38] when you are in your work and sometime
[1:54:40] I'm just in my day uh in in my working
[1:54:42] day, you see and I just stop a little
[1:54:44] bit and I say it's it's it must be
[1:54:46] anointing. You cannot okay and just say,
[1:54:48] "Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, I love you
[1:54:50] so much." Amen. Is there anything that I
[1:54:53] could do for you today to just make you

[2:00:01] Don't you love him? The more we hear
[2:00:03] about him, the more we love him. And we
[2:00:05] love him because he first loved us.
[2:00:09] Man, I've been just meditating on my own
[2:00:11] and thinking about so many things. And
[2:00:14] today was just such a wonderful
[2:00:15] refreshing service. Amen. Amen. To paint
[2:00:19] a clear
[2:00:20] picture. And I realized the message came
[2:00:23] to remove all the barriers that were
[2:00:26] hindering us from this understanding.
[2:00:29] I mean, there's doctrine involved.
[2:00:30] There's teaching. There's examples.
[2:00:32] There's all kinds of things that are
[2:00:33] included in the message. But the real
[2:00:35] purpose was to strip away the veil and
[2:00:38] every barrier that made this difficult.
[2:00:42] I thank God for that. Amen. Amen. Now,
[2:00:45] we're really thankful for our brother
[2:00:46] that he came by. And as we just pray, we
[2:00:49] want to ask God to make this more and
[2:00:50] more real to us every day, every moment
[2:00:53] of the day that we can lose the religion
[2:00:56] that's stuck in our mind. Our humanity
[2:00:58] and all the things that it can all fade
[2:01:00] away from us and every barrier that's in
[2:01:03] our mind. Yes, sir. Sometimes the
[2:01:05] barrier is not any longer in the church
[2:01:06] or any teaching. Sometimes the barrier
[2:01:08] is in our own mind. Glory. Amen. Let God
[2:01:12] just take the truth and wipe the barrier
[2:01:14] away so that we can come into this kind
[2:01:16] of relationship that brings us into real
[2:01:18] rest and a real identification and an
[2:01:20] understanding of we are and brings real
[2:01:23] faith and peace and rest. And as we
[2:01:27] pray, I also want to pray a special
[2:01:28] prayer for our brother Marcus. He's got
[2:01:31] a big project that the Lord laid on his
[2:01:32] heart to do a documentary on the seed of
[2:01:35] Abraham to to show us what God has done
[2:01:38] in his redemption plan. And I'd like for
[2:01:40] us to just pray that God will bless him
[2:01:42] and anoint him and inspire him and send
[2:01:44] all the help that he needs at the right
[2:01:45] time. And if you could just to remember
[2:01:47] to keep him in prayer for that. Let's
[2:01:50] bow our heads
[2:01:51] together. Dear heavenly father, we thank
[2:01:53] you, Lord Jesus. God, you've been so
[2:01:56] good to us, Lord. Again and again and
[2:01:59] again, you're trying to show us who we
[2:02:02] are and who you really are. Lord, we've
[2:02:05] had false understandings and
[2:02:08] misunderstandings and wrong pictures.
[2:02:10] Lord, some that have been painted for
[2:02:12] us. Some we've painted
[2:02:14] ourselves. But God, you've come and sent
[2:02:16] us the truth. And the truth is to push
[2:02:18] away all lies, all darkness, anything
[2:02:21] that would obscure a clear vision of
[2:02:23] what truth really is. And God, we're so
[2:02:26] thankful for that. We're thankful for
[2:02:28] the word you brought today. Lord, may it
[2:02:30] become the the only reality in our
[2:02:32] lives. The only thing that is true is
[2:02:34] this great understanding that you want
[2:02:36] us to have of who we are, who you are,
[2:02:40] and what your desire was from before the
[2:02:42] foundation of the world. Father, and
[2:02:44] where we fit into that desire. May it
[2:02:46] bring security. May it bring peace. May
[2:02:48] it bring genuine love. May it bring the
[2:02:51] reality of everything you've been trying
[2:02:52] to show us. May it come into us and flow
[2:02:54] out from us. For we give ourselves Aresh
[2:02:57] to you. We are so grateful, Lord. We
[2:03:01] thank you for our brother Marcus, Lord,
[2:03:02] and that he journeyed so far to come and
[2:03:04] be with us. We thank you for using him
[2:03:07] as a tool in your hand to help us. And
[2:03:09] God, we pray that you would pour
[2:03:11] blessings back upon him for his labor of
[2:03:14] love here, but also for the project
[2:03:16] you've laid on his heart. Lord, we just
[2:03:18] pray you would strengthen him, give him
[2:03:20] wisdom, give him a special anointing to
[2:03:23] see the project through to the end. And
[2:03:24] may it be done according to your desire.
[2:03:27] and may it be a maximum help to us and
[2:03:29] to many other people, Lord, that they
[2:03:31] may have eyes to see because of what
[2:03:33] you're going to show. I pray that you
[2:03:35] send him the right kind of help in the
[2:03:37] right season both physically,
[2:03:39] financially. Everything that he has need
[2:03:40] of, I pray you provide it, Lord, so that
[2:03:43] it wouldn't be brother Marcus' project,
[2:03:44] but it would be your project that you
[2:03:46] used him to see through to the end. We
[2:03:50] love you. We thank you, God, for all you
[2:03:51] say and do. And may the reality, Lord,
[2:03:55] become more than a teaching, more than a
[2:03:58] doctrine, more than a sermon. May it
[2:04:01] become alive inside of us. And may
[2:04:03] everything that you've poured in to us,
[2:04:06] may it be reflected back to you. And may
[2:04:08] you take joy in it as it all comes back
[2:04:10] to you, Lord. Back in praise, back in
[2:04:13] love, back in fellowship. May we pour
[2:04:15] back into you what you've poured into us
[2:04:18] so we might share true fellowship with
[2:04:20] you. We love you. We ask you would bless
[2:04:22] us as we part. Keep us safe along the
[2:04:24] ways. Bless the afternoon service with
[2:04:27] the young people. Lord, may you refresh
[2:04:29] our brother. Anoint him once again and
[2:04:30] use him once again to help us all the
[2:04:33] young ones among us to have a clear
[2:04:35] understanding as well. We love you. We
[2:04:38] give ourselves to you. In Jesus Christ's
[2:04:40] name we pray.
[2:04:42] Amen. God bless you all. It's been
[2:04:45] wonderful to have you here and those who
[2:04:46] are visiting, God bless you. It's been a
[2:04:48] pleasure to have you amongst us. Amen.

[2:12:10] inspires my heart with humble worship.
[2:12:17] I
[2:12:18] couldn't earn your love by

[2:13:14] broken. The
[2:13:16] image, Lord, you want to
[2:13:20] see reflecting you in me. The true and
[2:13:25] holy token.
[2:13:30] shall not break or read a
[2:13:35] line that's bruised in scar in this dark
[2:13:42] hour. You heal my body and my soul. For
[2:13:48] your love will make me whole by your
[2:13:53] restoring
[2:13:57] power. Unto you I'll sing my
[2:14:04] song. Lifting up your name, Lord
[2:14:11] Jesus. Wondous love is pure and strong.
[2:14:17] casting away my
[2:14:20] sin, changing me from
[2:14:24] within. You are
[2:14:28] faithful to
[2:14:31] me. You are
[2:14:37] faithful. You are faithful.
