TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he wants to come in you and he's pulling you out of egypt and bringing you into promises of word and he's giving you boundaries and that boundary is your own life amen and he wants to drive out all unbelief amen every bit of unbelief drive out of you so that he his word takes preeminence in you and when his word takes for a minute it's in you the light of god the life of god shines out from you and it becomes an attractant amen that will bring the elect to your light and you realize when god gave them commandments and got them the territory he wanted to bring everything under this territory subject to the word even by force but he never gave them permission to go outside of those boundaries and conquer another people and make them believers they were never to make converts by conquest they were make converts by light and becoming the light of the world they would draw people to the light when they come to the light they would be pointed to the source of the light which was the word of god given by god himself and then they could come in contact with the light but they were never instructed by god they were never given permission ever to go beyond these boundaries to go and conquer amen to go and conquer another nation and bring them into the faith that was forbidden because that is not god's plan but that is the denominational plan that comes from nimrod that's exactly what nimrod did nimrod because he was a mighty hunter before the lord he would go and conquer a city or establish another kingdom and he would bring it subject unto babel bring a subject into this false unity and religion by force amen but god is never wanting to use force to gather his elect he is always gathering his elect by the shining of light and the elect are attracted to light and they move to light by free moral agency this is god's plan to redeem his children and he wants to use you and he wants you to possess your vessel and he wants you to drive by force out of your mind out of your conscience out of your life anything that's contrary to the word and bring this vessel of yours subject to the entire word that the word has preeminence so that he can shine light and the light is the life of men and by that light it will attract the elect of god but never by conquest
