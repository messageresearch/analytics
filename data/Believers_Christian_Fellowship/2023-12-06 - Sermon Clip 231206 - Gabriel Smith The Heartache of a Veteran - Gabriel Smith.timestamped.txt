[0:00] no matter what happens in life to me I
[0:03] I've come to a place to where there's
[0:06] there there's a settledness in my life
[0:09] that I've never felt on this measure
[0:12] before and and and to me I'm at a spot
[0:17] where it's like Lord I want every I want
[0:20] everybody to feel
[0:22] this you know what I mean I mean I mean
[0:26] when you when you when you have that
[0:27] reality of God it's like it it's like
[0:30] everything that you've heard on the
[0:33] tapes is real in your life you
[0:37] understand what I'm saying I mean it's
[0:38] like I mean it's like to to maybe for me
[0:40] it's such an
[0:42] extreme of of my past and then the now
[0:46] but it's so overwhelming but to me I
[0:48] look and I think I don't know how you
[0:50] tick in your mind and in your heart but
[0:53] to me friends I'll be honest with you
[0:55] when I'm sitting in row five it's all I
[0:57] can do not to
[0:58] busten
[1:01] praise
[1:03] God and to me it's like because it's
[1:07] real it's not emotion it it's a life
[1:10] that pulsates and you God you talk to
[1:13] God and God talks back and God helps you
[1:16] overcome something and whatever you're
[1:18] struggling with you have the ability
[1:20] that whenever you're dealing with it on
[1:21] the job you can see Satan come at you
[1:24] and you can flip the script on him and
[1:26] he's left speechless and you walk away
[1:29] like thank you Lord oh man you're so
[1:32] good right to me friends that's that to
[1:36] me that's the whole point of being an
[1:37] overcomer that that that we as grown men
[1:41] I don't you know it used to be all about
[1:43] being a tough guy and you know trying to
[1:45] be uh hard and but but to me listen I I
[1:50] I can't help but to hardly listen to a a
[1:52] a song and just weep I'm I'm driving on
[1:55] the way to work and on the way home
[1:57] weeping you know just the the presence
[1:59] of the Lord so sweet and and I'm
[2:02] thinking th I if if if I can feel this
[2:06] way at the ending of time what in the
[2:08] world is heaven going to be

[2:27] place of hope that you can I I promise
[2:28] you look if if you don't know how to get
[2:31] there then then then then then talk to

[2:52] a in a halfway
[2:54] filling friends I'm not talking about

[2:59] I'm not saying that but what I'm saying
[3:01] is the joy bells of God ought to be
[3:03] flowing in your life in a way that's so
[3:06] special to you that that when you're on
[3:08] the job when you're at home when when
[3:10] you're by yourself whatever it may be
[3:13] wherever you're at and nobody's around
[3:14] and you're a three states away the joy
