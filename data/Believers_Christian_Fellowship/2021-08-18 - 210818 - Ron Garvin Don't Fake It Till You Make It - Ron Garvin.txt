========================================
yes i feel like traveling traveling on i feel like traveling oh my heavenly home i is like traveling on one more time yes i feel like traveling on home is [Music] who teach me to be [Music] me show me your perfect [Music] fill me with your thoughts make it all brand new change my [Music] life in all that's true [Music] oh let me be pleasing to you let everything i do be pleasing to you [Music] pray let everything i pursue be pleasing you one more time [Music] please [Music] be pleasing to you [Music] let everything i pursue [Music] be pleasing oh lord [Music] amen just as we bow our heads to pray i'd like to read a scripture that's precious to me you can turn to it if you wish to it's not our text but psalm 69 verse 5 and 6. musicians you can be seated or you can go stand with the rest of them don't be seated yet god bless you greetings to each one of you here it's good to see our brother from arizona with us this evening and i know i'm speaking to several new faces that maybe have never spoken to or spoken with god bless you each one this has been my prayer for a long time psalms 69 verse 5 and 6 oh god thou knowest my foolishness my sins are not hid from thee let not them that wait on thee o lord god of hosts be ashamed for my sake let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake o god of israel because i stand up here knowing a lot of my faults and a lot of my failures and shortcomings and it would grieve me to uh to know something some of my shortcomings would too hinder the walk or a testimony of one of you or any of god's people even those out in the world to witness my faults and failures and shortcomings and we just want to stay surrendered that the lord can use us especially as i stand before you in an uncomfortable position all eyes upon me and it's easy to revert back to comfort zones that are not convenient for the gospel shall we say so let's just bow our heads and just ask the lord to take the service this evening heavenly father before we even look at our texts this evening we just want to come before your presence lord and just ask you to take the vessel lord on both sides of this pulpit lord and just help the speaker lord to be surrendered out of the way lord and may you take the insufficiencies and the faults and failures and everything that you've molded into this vessel lord by your choice choosing take those lord and get glory unto yourself through them lord and help me father god not to get ron garvin in the way tonight we just pray father that the people will be lifted up blessed helped benefited lord i pray that you'll answer prayers this evening i pray that the people have come expecting something from you not something from me lord but just expecting you to deliver lord even in spite of uh of who would be standing at the pulpit lord we just expect you to be standing here father so we just surrender this vessel lord to you and i pray father that each one out there lord be surrendered can get past their false failures and foibles lord and and they can receive what you have for them tonight lord and i pray that each one of us will be blessed this evening father you know i've got a lot on my heart and and not having the ability to deliver it lord to my satisfaction so i just want to step aside father and i just want you to use the vessel lord if you don't use the notes that's fine lord just use the vessel father for your honor and glory we ask it in jesus name amen praise the lord let's turn to our text while we're standing hebrews chapter 11. [Music] a couple of short scripture readings here hebrews chapter 11 verse 1. hebrews 11 1 says now faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen in hebrews 13 8 very familiar scriptures not bringing anything new to you tonight maybe from just a little different angle hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever amen may god's word bless us this evening you may be seated i just pray the lord to help me to tie these things together tonight or to get out of the way and let him tight tie these things together tonight first of all i wanted to apologize to brother kyle i never did get a little note sent to you to saying how much i appreciated wednesday's service and i was right on board with you from the very get-go sometimes we feel like we're bringing a repeat service from brother chad and that's what i feel like i'm doing but as brother kyle said we each bring our own unique perspective to it and if it takes three or four times for us to finally get it through our heads then that's the way it's got to be but paul said in in second corinthians 13 1 says in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established so if i'm repeating what kyle repeated let it be established and i pray what i say is lining up with the word and what brother kyle says it doesn't matter if we line up with what brother chad says if it doesn't line up with the word then we're all off so let's not establish it two or three witnesses together that are off the word let's let's get it on the word and with the message of the hour and and then we can walk in confidence amen praise the lord so let's let this word be thoroughly established uh you know as i have gone over this for i guess a couple weeks now and uh today as i was uh out working on the roads and uh just going over this in my mind all day so somehow i've got to take my sermon that i perfected over eight hours of work and jam it in to just a little short time but there's there's no hope for that i don't even know that i can get all my notes in i mean if i just read through them it would be a short service but uh as i thought on it today it just became precious so let me just get out of the way and and somehow and just allow the lord to take this and i don't know if i'll be able to follow my my notes or not but but just let the lord have her have his liberty uh tonight now i wanted to give you just a little bit of background i haven't given you the title don't get impatient here uh some of you know me some of you don't um i guess those that don't will get to know me so here's a little background for the thought this evening see that brothers and sisters in pakistan they have weekly bible studies and i speak for them about once a month and usually always on a saturday morning well it was the end of july and on a friday morning before as i was leaving for work i checked my whatsapp and there was a text in there says uh could you speak for us on saturday now that gave me less than 24 hours to prepare for a service and i was totally unprepared i'd been busy at work just didn't have a chance to hardly listen to messages i took my message messages and listened to him in the truck while i'm driving a truck spraying tar and uh for the county roads and but sometimes i just have to unplug it because i'm just too focused on what i'm doing and too distracted so this is the way it had been for quite a while so i busy at work busy at home with a big project and here i've been asked to speak for bible study in less than 24 hours or a little over 24 hours i think it was i was totally unprepared and so i went to work and still i thought well i'll just just concentrate on the lord and just get a blessing from the lord today and see what i've got for the brothers and sisters on saturday morning still busy busy busy finally on the way home from work i thought what am i going to do i only have 24 hours left what am i going to do this title this thought came to my mind i'm going to use it for my title it's kind of a unorthodox which i guess is kind of a common place for me the title for tonight is don't do not don't fake it or make it perhaps you've heard that slogan before had a good minister friend that i was told that used to use say that quite a bit fake it till you make it and a good friend of mine and i don't know that i ever heard him say that but that was what i'd heard somebody tell me that was kind of his slogan fake it till you make it and well maybe what he meant by that was claim the promise until you receive it and i'll agree with him on that but as i was preparing for a service for a bible study the thought came to my mind you know you can fake it till you make it but i don't want to do that so let's examine this a little bit tonight uh you know we're all familiar with brother branham's testimony when he was he had a stomach ulcer and he was still living at home with his parents and he claimed his healing and he had eaten i think he had eaten soup beans and onions or something like that he'd swallow that down and i think he maybe vomited it up and just shove it back down and his mother says are you okay so i'm fine now that is that faking it till you make it well he was claiming the promises we want to examine the difference claim the promise even though you don't have the evidence it's not there before you whether it's a physical healing or whatever your need is claim it if there's a promise for it claim it don't fake it we don't want to fake the promise let's claim the promise we also familiar with the blind man that brother branham prayed for and uh brother bram said well you just keep on he said well i'm not healed he went through the prayer line i think he went through twice he said you said you healed me he said well you said you believed me well what do i do i can't see i'm still blind we'll keep claiming your healing so praise the lord i'm healed blind as a bat praise the lord i'm healed blind as a bat now that's not faking it that's believing it faking it would he go would we go get in the car and say i can see i can see as good as anybody else i'm taking off that's faking me because he couldn't see but he was claiming it and he claimed it big till he became the laughing stock of the town but he stood on that promise until it came to pass now we admire someone who stands in the word and claims the promises but i want to draw a distinction between claiming the promises and faking it faith is the substance now maybe we can't really understand that maybe i i don't well here we here we go right here's a good example just use myself as an example i'm not gonna fake it and claim that i understand this faith is a substance you know i can't hold on to faith a substance is something you you can touch and feel in my mind you know faith is a substance but there's a reality to it that is more more real than what you can touch do i understand it with my human mind no i'm not going to fake it but i'm going to claim it faith is a substance things hope for the evidence of things not seen so what's the difference between fake and faith well it's got a snappy little you know my title's got a snappy little uh rhythm to it you'll fake it till you make it so it's an easy little slogan to have there uh so uh but what brought that to mine was you know being having that bible study looking me in the face less than 24 hours to prepare what do i do i had some options before me i could decline the invitation and they would accept that i've done that before when i was going to be out of town these bible studies over skype skype meetings so i had to cancel one so i could cancel uh or i could manufacture a bible study you know fake it or i could admit to the brothers that i just don't have anything i i don't have anything just be honest so i hated to decline but even worse than that would be to fake it and that's when this little saying came to mind and i began to examine the fallacy of the statement and that's what uh when viewed from that standpoint that uh not just claiming it but faking it we don't want to do that so i suppose we're all familiar with brother branham's prayer lines and how he stood helpless until the angel of the lord showed up he'd say i can do nothing he'd just kind of him all around and he'd say you know i'm you know i'm i'm stalling i forget how how i express it there you know i'm i'm waiting i'm waiting on something i can't do anything you know if he doesn't come then we'll just uh we'll just have a prayer line and bring it through and lay hands on you why would you try to fake discernment you can't fake that he knew better than that he just admitted that he was helpless you know the human thing to do is to kind of press on because we don't want to lose space and so we just press on you know and somebody says well you're going the wrong way well you get out here on the interstate i'm supposed to head south on 75 and i make the wrong turn and heading north and my wife says uh aren't we going the wrong way i know i know exactly what i'm doing here comes beaver dam you know way out of way out of the way now that didn't really happen but i have made the wrong turn before well what are you going to do you're going to fake it yeah i planned to come down this way i had to check something out you know you're going to fake it or just admit it say yeah i did i think i better find an exit and get back on the right road let's be honest not just fake it till you make it because you may not make it if you're going the wrong direction so so we could manufacture a bible study you could imitate the anointing of the lord impersonate an anointing uh you could stir up the people's emotions with psychology and uh and maybe they'd never know that you was just you know flying by the seat of your pants so i started out this bible study with the pakistan when this thought came to me and it ended up developing over just a few hours i was put it together and i wasn't faking it i was walking in faith at that point god's given me a thought and i'm just going to get up there and i'm going to express it to him the best i know how and that's what i'm doing tonight i got a lot more notes but still i don't know how to put them together i don't know how to touch each heart here but he does so if i can just get out of the way and allow him to do it then he'll touch touch the need so speaking to the pakistanis i wanted to make sure the interpreter was on the same page with me so i make sure he understands my title says do you know what fake is he says oh yes yes fake that is the substance of things hoped for the evidence no no the god got the wrong fake f-a-k-e fake not faith so i explained it to him and as you begin to explain what fake means means it becomes ever more apparent why we do not want to fake it till we make it so we're going to look at a definition of that it's not appropriate for christian to fake it until he makes it definition of fake not genuine counterfeit a forgery or sham the opposite of genuine if there's anything we need in this day and age is genuine we need we do we don't need fake it's just a hindrance to the move of god if you're sitting here as a fake christian tonight don't leave this building in that same condition you say well i can't do it well you're on the right road now because you're admitting that quit faking it admit it and and get down to business with god and he'll uh he'll take care of the rest of it a few synonyms for fake forgery counterfeit copy sham fraud hoax imitation fraudulent false bogus worthless invalid dead artificial pretend to dupe or doctor forge falsify alter or tamper with you don't want that to be your testimony is that our testimony with this word of god are we altering it are we doctoring it so many people can be a fake message believer but to do that they have to alter the message i'm a message believer i go to a message church but that doesn't apply to me i don't need to fulfill that that's not for me this is not my time that's not to be manifested through let's not alter it let's not tamper with it it's not doctored up is there anything that you've heard in that definition so far that would inspire you yes i want to fake it till i make it i don't think there's anything that was uh would be uh uh inspiring us to do that um you know the way i've seen the lord move he'll just uh through me it's not me but just it's just the way he i guess i guess it's every minister but it's always uh stands out to me when he does it takes his finger and puts it right on a sore spot and uh and i'm the tip of that finger you know and it touches so if it touches a sore spot tonight that's him speaking to you he doesn't want fake christians if that's the way you're doing if that's the way you're living uh well let's just go ahead and push on that sore spot a little bit because we don't want you going out of here like that i don't want to meet i don't want me going out here like that so another way to phrase this and fake it till you make it another way to phrase it would be impersonate a christian until you become a christian that doesn't sound very uh good pretend you have the holy ghost until you get the holy ghost why don't do that act like something you're not until you become what you are what you're pretending pretending to be imitate your healing before healing before it happens uh my titles don't do that don't fake it till you make it don't be an impersonator don't be a pretender a liar a pharisee a hypocrite a fake an imposter a counterfeit uh we can fake a physical healing but that's just a hoax you know we can say well i've injured my leg but it's all better and i just walk like this because i like this swagger no uh it's just a it's just a hoax it's a fraud you're falsifying the truth you're you're duping the people and people see through that they see through it it's worthless that was part of our death definitions a dud anybody want to be a dud you know back in back when i was in school the big uh big uh insult to people was to say a loser you big loser uh you big dud i guess that probably goes back before my time but it's all one and the same anybody here want to be a dead a dead christian a dead believer we don't want to fake being anointed for the preaching we don't want to get up and pretend like we've got a message from the lord and just stir the people up and uh jump up and down and and pretend like we're something and god's done something for us and he's got something to speak god has set the gifts in order brother branham set the gifts in order speaking in tongues is to bring a a direct message to the people not just up there entertaining and the the pentecostals could not mature they could not accept that and so they rejected him partly for that we don't want to we don't want that to be the way the ministry is either just getting up here and entertaining you and letting myself or the minister whoever he is get in the way and entertain the people god's got something he wants to speak now let's get out of the way and let him do so and if you haven't got something to speak then just admit it and sit down you say well i would i want to save face not in this situation you don't want to save face you better be honest to be a sham or a con artist that's which is what you would be up here you know you we familiar with the snake oil salesman back in the old days travel around with their wagon had to cure all for everything and that's just a con artist just a sham that's got no place in god's economy especially not behind the pulpit we want to pretend to have the mind of christ on a subject you know it's so easy people come up you know if you're a minister if you're traveling overseas and brother what should i do about this situation you know uh well well brother tell you what you need to do you know we've always got the mind of christ for the other person uh now when it comes to our own situation what i do what do i do but oh brother what you need to do you you need to move here you need to move there you need to go here you need to do this as if god has spoken that directly to us now maybe he has if so then speak it but don't be a fraud don't be a pretender don't be a fake don't fake it till you make it i know exactly what you need to do you're faking it if you're faking it don't do that uh it's that's a dead it's worthless uh you lead somebody astray just like the scripture you read in uh psalm 69 your fear of losing face is going to be a stumbling block to somebody because when they follow your uh leadership because that brother had the mind of the lord for me and i've went done this and i wasn't done that and it all falls apart and you're left there holding the pieces how can you ever have faith in that brother again it's worthless be genuine the opposite of fake admit you don't have the mind of the lord if you don't if you do speak it speak it in confidence with two or three witnesses bring it back to the bible bring it back to the word so well the word says brother god can use an honest vessel to speak through and i pray that he does that tonight brother branham didn't pretend to be able to discern the thoughts of people's hearts there's no need to be a fake with that that was a genuine gift it was god's gift it was god operated it it wasn't brother branham's gift it wasn't now i understand what i'm saying here he had the gift but he didn't go acquire that gift god gave that gift to him and that was god's gift to the people through him using him but he could not just operate that by himself he just had to rely upon the lord and he was honest enough to say i can do nothing until he comes and does it through me and we find ourselves in the same position no matter if you're behind the pope or if you're out there whatever you're doing in life it isn't our responsibility to manufacture the holy ghost or any of the gifts of the holy ghost it's not up to us to manufacture our healing our faith uh our revelation we're supposed to pray for revelation brother braham didn't say go conjure up your revelation don't go manufacture your revelation don't go work it up he said pray for it so it's not our responsibility to bring revelation to ourself well if i study this message and i read through it and i dissect it and i work diagram at night you're getting nowhere you're wasting your time go back to the beginning brother brown said if you study a flower for afra he was at 30 minutes sincerely you know more than they could teach in the sunday in the seminaries you know more about god if you just approach things in the right manner it's god's responsibility to keep his word not you just like a wife is not responsible to run out and provide for the man and we understand those situations come come up sometimes the man's able not able to or whatever and the wife has to step in there and help but it's not it's not her responsibility to to do all the work and to defend the man and and as a wife of jesus christ we we're not responsible to make his words come true if the husband gives his word to somebody it's not the wife's responsibility to keep that word he gave his word he needs to be do you want to keep it and if god give his word it's not for us to try to manufacture so if he calls a man to the ministry it's god's responsibility to give him something to say it's god's responsibility to touch the hearts of the people through that gift if it's uh if it's just a man up there faking it you know maybe you'll fool some people maybe you'll maybe you'll do something but in an eternal sense what good is it our responsibility is to be surrendered for his use it's not our responsibility to be uh manufacturing a sermon coming up with something to say because i know that brother's going through this hard time and this sister's doing this and and we've got this situation in the church and i need to to get up there and solve it for the lord that's that's useless you say well shouldn't you do a little bit of studying and praying well i think that's part of being surrendered but our faith and our confidence doesn't come in our ability to pray or to study it's solely upon his calling and that's that's all i can say because the closer i get to coming out for the pulpit you know all had a wonderful time thinking on these notes today and i couldn't wait to deliver them and i sat back there and the time draws near and i think this is a shambles how am i how in the world am i going to get it all together it's not my responsibility it's his he's called me it's his responsibility to use the gift as he would you as he would desire to my responsibility just to get out of the way let him let him do it then i can rest are you a little nervous brother on well yeah there is always that element there but i can nervously rest somehow but we're not going to get up here and fake it till we make it he's already made it for us amen that's where our faith is that he has already made it in trying to get the concept of this uh little slogan over to the brothers of pakistan i used this example i thought that it'd be something they could understand so why would i counterfeit if i was going to go to pakistan why would i make a counterfeit passport i've got i've got the real thing it's genuine it's approved it's been used it's it's good it will work why would i go forge one why would i make a counterfeit one why would i fake one if i've got the genuine article why the only reason you would need to forge a document like that is if you're unable to get the genuine article and the only reason you could not get a genuine passport is maybe you're not qualified well you can get qualified maybe you're an immigrant or uh maybe you don't have all your proper documentations but if you follow them if you just go to the website there and you follow the rules fill out all the documents send them in all the proper things and and you're an upstanding citizen a competent individual a law abiding there's no reason you cannot get a genuine us passport i don't know all the qualifications for those but i don't see any reason why you couldn't maybe you've got something in your past there's ways to get those things cleared from your record and and become a and get a passport so if just go about it legally then you don't have to worry when you go to the when you go to the airport and you hand that to them when i arrived in pakistan and you hand it to the guy and he gets it out he's got his magnifying glasses on he puts it under the light he really examines that and he looks you in the eye and he looks back at that he looks you in the eye there was no nervousness on my part i'm not faking it that's the genuine article if he's got a problem with that then he needs to talk to the state department he needs to talk to the to whoever issued he doesn't need to talk to me that's not my problem if he's got a problem with it then we gotta we gotta go somewhere else uh so i could go with confidence i didn't have to wet uh sweat it out or or worry that uh this is not gonna go through but if you've got a forged document you just hope your forgery is sufficient to get you through now you may forge a document here and be able to pass it through but you're not going to forge your christianity you're not going to fake your christianity and slip that past the lord you may get it past you know i could probably print a a fake dollar bill on a good printer and i might be able to see one of you just pass it off to you and you'd well you just trust me and take it and go on but you know anybody that's really trained would would understand that that's not a real dollar bill you know that's that's just on cardboard you know whatever it is and uh you i may fool you but you're not gonna fool somebody that knows anything about it you know somebody works at a bank or or the uh you know the treasury department you're not gonna fool them and you're not gonna fool the lord with your fake uh christianity you may fool me and i said well that's that's a really good brother he just is so attentive in church and he just really amens and he's really responsive to the word and he's just all about it and he just he's right there for all the things and you may fool me but are really are you who you need to get this approved by you don't need to you don't need to uh get my recommendation to get into heaven we've gotta we've gotta pass this by the judge the lord he knows he knows all the time that that you're just faking it kinda like adam and eve faking their but he knew what was what their condition was so if you just follow all the rules sign all the documents send all the proper documentation in to get your passport you'll get it just trust rest rest is the thing now i know bureaucracy takes a long time to grind around full circle and but if you've filled out everything just just rest don't get impatient because it'll take a couple weeks to get it and don't say i've got to have it i've got to have it now i've got to go print my own i've got to make my own i've got to forge it just rest just rest same thing with the promises of god if you filled out all the if you've done everything that the book says and you've left no stone unturned rest rest on it then you can claim the promise don't fake it say i've got a promise right here it says it says i'm healed it says i'm i've he's promised the holy ghost to me he's promised whatever it is that that you're claiming if you can see it in there you can claim it just rest let him bring it to pass don't try to go out and manufacture and say well i haven't seen you i'm praying for the holy ghost i just haven't seen so i'm going to get up speaking tongues this sunday and i just i've been practicing you're faking it quit that nonsense rest in the lord rest in him takes a while for government to further bureaucracy to finally get that passport back to you but when you get it back it's the genuine article you don't have any worries about it let the lord fulfill his promises then you don't have to worry about it you don't have to if you if you're praying for a physical healing you don't have to imitate them oh i'm i'm better i'm better yeah this this limp is just uh because i kind of got used to it kind of liked it no there'll be no limp you know if god touches you and heals you in that way just just rest on the lord then you don't have to fake anything just follow the procedures the only reason you can't receive a promise from god maybe you're ineligible see there are qualifications uh you want to receive the holy ghost there's a promise for it but you've got to follow the procedures been baptized repented first not penance we don't do penance repentance repent turn from your ways claim that promise is there any stone left unturned uh or do you you know there's a lot of things a lot of documents you've got to do when you when you send off a passport you've got oh i don't know birth certificates and all these records and stuff you've got to send in and and you've got to have a sealed envelope and a self addressed and all the postage paid and that may be for the uh i think i know you have to do that when you're applying for a visa but there's there's procedures that you've got to go through you can't just write on a post you know a sticky note says hey i'd like to have a passport send it off to him it ain't gonna pass well maybe you do follow procedures you'll get it hey hey lord i'd like to have the holy ghost that'd be great you know i'd that'd be that'd be kind of neat you can have it you got to follow the procedures don't leave any stone left unturned when i'm sending off that kind of stuff to go overseas i'm reading through there and re-reading through there and have i missed anything i've got have i got everything have i sent in the right money order in am i and it kind of makes you a little bit nervous have i got everything right but when you get everything right then you can rest you put it in the mail and you just rest you wait upon the lord to uh up on well wait upon the lord to bring it back to you when you're doing a applying for a visa because there's no guarantee that you're going to get a visa but i can rest when i send off for a visa because that's kind of dependent on the country that you're going to it's like whether they'll accept you or not and i said well if they don't then it's not the lord's will but if god wants me to go they'll accept it i don't care how tarnished my record is or whatever they don't like about it uh he'll pass it through so we can we can rest on that you know if you get impatient and you forge a passport that's one of the things that'll disqualify you from getting a genuine passport don't go forward you wonder wonder if that would also disqualify us from getting the holy ghost we go forging faking uh committing fraud getting up and pretending like we're something that may just disqualify us you know and i didn't think about that till now if you're just faking it god may just let you fake it until you get tired of it and finally come to him say lord i gotta be honest i haven't got the goods i don't have what i want i'm tired of faking it lord give me the real deal now you can rest because you finally become genuine you finally become honest amen my original thought for the pakistani bible study was i don't want to pretend to have a bible study if god if god's not giving me one if he doesn't do something for me i i've either got to cancel or i've got to just get up and say well god bless you brothers god hasn't given me anything let's not let's not fake it uh you know as a as a minister there's always a pressure there you've got to get you've got to have a sermon you know if if brother chad asked you could you speak for us well uh yeah sure now i've got to go manufacture something no you don't you better not yeah if god doesn't give it then be better off just get up here and say god bless you saints god is good he hasn't given me anything i don't know what you do but but let's not be faking it amen you know you can get up here and use your impressive preacher's voice i need to practice on that one i guess maybe we could fool the people uh get up here and be dynamic i'd have to practice that one too jump around whatever maybe i'd fool somebody but i think you would probably all see right through that and i think you'd be kind enough to pray for me brother branham didn't fake his gift he was helpless to discern the thoughts of people and he admitted to that hidden he'd say i'm just waiting for the angel to come brother branham had a lot of contemporaries in the uh healing ministries in the temp ministries uh when he was on earth and at the same time it seemed like their ministries were bigger better more powerful more impressive and i wonder how much that was just fake because you know i don't know how true it is but you hear stories where this one fell that one fell this one went here this went there just up there faking it drawing people because there was a spirit on the on the land at that time and and the spirit of god was moving and and men just tapped into that and got up there and faked it and made a name for themselves and they still do today and they could even do it right here in the in the message of the hour and uh make a name for yourself and impress people and pull people but it's worthless if it's not from the lord but satan puts a pressure on a minister to perform i suppose he puts it on all of us as a christian to perform you've got to be there you've got to get to the prayer meeting you got you got you need to sit on the front row you just so you stand up everybody see how religious you are and uh you know people's got to see this and uh he puts a pressure on us to perform like a like a high pressure salesman but we don't have to jump through the devil's hoops you know bose moses didn't remember when janus and jambers uh performed the same miracle that he did uh brother branham said in the anointed ones at the end time it says did moses fuss at him and say here here you can't do that i'm the only one been ordained to do that here you stop that right now he just let him go let him go on remember the bible said as their followers made manifest so will these in the last day be made manifest when the bride is raptured and taken into the sky there's no need to jump through the devil's hoops we don't we don't have to say you know hey you you minister you can't be doing that you're preaching the message you you can't do that that's not our job let's just be genuine and do what god's called us to do and and god will make manifest the true and the false a couple of quotes from uh 1953 series israel in the church brother braham says let's go back now and get the beginning and find out how sure this word is now bear this in mind as we glean through this bible you'll see that the cogs of god's wheels turn slow but sure may look like it's a million miles away but she's grinding right up there all the time and one of these days it'll be here in a couple services later still in that same series he said god's word must every time be fulfilled we could preach on that that is just an astounding statement so that's pretty simple but let that soak in god's word must every time be fulfilled if he's promised in his word that there will be a bride there's going to be a bride if he's promised whatever it is that you have need of it's going to come to pass it's his word the cogs of god's prophecy grind slow but sure if you do wrong you think you're getting by but just remember young man or woman it's going to grind right up to your door one of these days you wonder when and how but it'll be there you'll reap what you sow every time god spoke it it's got to be so thy word is settled in heaven forever it's already said i love this statement here they don't argue about it up there it's already settled we argue about it but in glory it's settled we may want to say well the holy ghost isn't isn't manifested in this day and age but if god said it is it is you can argue with it you can say well it is only for the 12 12 disciples it's settled in heaven it's done deal we don't need to argue about it we don't need to get up say hey hey you can't teach that it's a done deal can't you just settle in your heart tonight lord jesus i believe you that settles it hallelujah i'm coming now i want you to give me the baptism of the spirit and you'll get it right there all right then forever god will seal you by the holy spirit until the day of your redemption all right the cogs of god's machine grind slow but if there's a promise in the bible healing holy ghost salvation salvation your family whatever it is that you're praying about you have need of it's already settled in heaven we don't need to be other people may argue about it but as believers we shouldn't be arguing about it down here if they're not arguing about it up here let's not argue about it down here i said lord i don't understand it somehow you said you'd forgive me for all my past i take you at your word you said you'd fill me with the holy ghost when i was baptized and repented i've done that lord now just let the cogs grind on slow it'll arrive in perfect time the wheels of god's time appeals timepiece real slow but sure this brought an example to mine and as you know done a little farming all my life kind of retired from that now but on this farm i've spent many an hour riding on the hay wagon behind the square baler so i want to just tell you a little story about that now the hay baler it puts out a square bale 18 inches wide 14 inches thick about three feet long and you stand on the wagon and as it comes out of the baler you take it by the two strings you walk with the back of the wagon you set it down you walk back to the front you get the next one it comes off and you walk back and you keep stacking it stacking it you get all the way to the front you get a full wagon you unhook it hook another empty and you keep on going i spent many an hour on that new holland haybaler stacking the hay to take to the barn these bales are about 60 pounds or so unless you get in some wet hay then it may be heavier than that but 60 pounds about right for a little skinny farm boy so i'd like to explain the mechanism i know all you sisters are getting ready to fall asleep we got a spiritual lesson to this so you just we're not just up here telling stories brother branham didn't just get up and tell stories i don't think the lord inspired this just for humor or entertainment or just to pass the time so let me explain now i'm from the 60s era myself and so these balers that we worked on were old at that time they were from from the 60s and 70s i don't know what the new ones they may be set up a little different but i'm talking about the old style now they don't even need a guy on the wagon they've got different setups back in the old days it was the little boys riding on the on the wagon so you hooked this baler square baler hook it up to the tractor put the hitch pin in it hook a pto shaft that's a power takeoff that clicks onto the back of the tractor and then you throw a lever or a clutch there to engage that and that pto shaft begins to spin that pto shaft drives a big flywheel big steel wheel and it begins to spin optimum speeds about 540 revolutions per minute as that's spinning that flywheel is connected to a gearbox that gearbox drives these gathering teeth gathering tines and they pick the hay up off the ground and they pull it into the baler then there's uh i would call them uh crossfeed times is what i'd call them there's these ties that take take that hay as it comes up and they slide it over into the bale chamber and they go over everything's keeping time with the flywheel well also on that gearbox there's a big plunger 14 inches tall 18 inches wide the same size as the bale that's the size of the of the bale chamber the hate comes in there and that plunger punches it and it's just a steady rhythm so i've spent many an hour standing on that wagon the wagon's rocking and the baler is rocking as that plunger big old heavy thing it's a plunging and it's making a it's going at 540 rpm that plunger is making oh 70 or 80 strokes per minute one stroke in less than a second big whoop i can hear it now and the wagon is just kind of rocking back and forth because everything's everything's working there that flywheel's spinning the plunger is plunging it's got a big blade so as the hay goes in it got a big blade and it cuts it off plunges it compacts it those tines have got to get out of the way because if they don't that plunger will just snap them right off and then you're done bailing for the day so everything's in perfect time we're thinking of god's timing everything's in perfect time and as the tractor goes down through the through the uh through the hayfield there's big mounds of dried hay in big long rows sometimes those stacks of hay they may be this this big this wide and as that the gathering tines pull it up in there and the cross feed ties they throw it into the chamber and that plunger is just plunging away cutting it and plunging it and everything looks like making a lot of noise and a lot of dust and a lot of things going on but in the back there's a fascinating mechanism to me it's called the knotter it's a little unit there sets up there and it ties the knots in the haystream it's not doing anything it's just sitting there not doing a single thing all this work going on tines are working cross feed going flywheels are spinning the plungers are plunging tractors are grown in the grunting and the guy on the wagon he's a he's a working and the knotters just sit there not doing a single thing there's not much happening on the back of that baler except for one little wheel it's a little star-shaped wheel about that big and it as the hay comes into the chamber that little wheel touches it and it just turns ever so slowly and as that turns slowly it drives a shaft there's a lever on that shaft and as that shaft turns it slowly goes it'll only go up about two inches slowly raises very you can hardly watch it you mean if you're getting a lot of hay going in there you can see the you can see the metering wheel they call it you can see the metering wheel turning very slowly but you can hardly see that lever that lever slowly raises and when it gets to the top it releases snaps a clutch as the plunger comes back out of the chamber two two needles with strings attached to them come up through the bottom the plunger comes back and it's getting ready to come right back in there and snap those needles off that comes up there the knotters flip in a split second tie the knots cut the strings the needles come back out back going at it again and then nothing's happened in the back just that little wheel slowly turning nodders just sitting there needles just sitting there nothing's happening but that metering wheel is slowly turning marking out the time marking out the length of that bale it knows when to tie the bale the guy on the tractor he doesn't determine that the guy on the wagon he doesn't determine that they can adjust it and as they need to but when everything's set properly they just need to wait maybe that tractor not wagon go a quarter mile down the road because because maybe there's not much hay just a little bit and there's not enough to make a bale don't get up there and try to tie the bale the metering wheel knows when it's time to tie the tie the bale just rest so that that flywheel is just hitting and we think you know in our lives nothing's happening he said lord nothing's happening i pray for something nothing happens it's just that same old grind of everyday go to work clock in clock out go to church sunday wednesday nothing's happened lord what are you doing what's happening nothing's happening in my life but his wheel is turning measuring knowing the right time to trigger everything and then when it does everything's got to work instantly within less than a second because that plunger is coming right back in less than a second everything's got to get up there tie the knots get it out of the way and go right back to the same old mundane monday through friday wash the kids face feed them their breakfast clean up after them go to church come home clock in clock out nothing's happening god knows he's got a metering wheel on your life in my life lord what's happening i know i felt that way and this isn't in the notes so we're just going to go with it there was a time oh a long time ago that i was in that same condition go to church come home what's going on just doing the same thing go and run the sound at church and record the services and go home go to church and come home and go to school or go to work and just lord what have you got for my life and i remember i think i've told this here before setting at the family camp down in st mary's just sitting there on the tailgate of my truck playing the guitar somebody walked by me and i don't know who it was and uh because i didn't really know anybody at the camp somebody walked by turn around come back they said if you'll read the message the oddball you'll find the answer to your question and okay thank you brother did i have a question didn't know i had a question uh because i got caught up in that just just the same old mundane everything but in my heart there was a question and so i went home and read that message probably on the first page or two brother branham there's two sermons titled the oddball the one he was speaking to brother jean goad and leo mercer i believe it was he was saying i knew these boys had more that they could do than just make tapes that's what i was doing just tape the service run the sound mail out the tapes to those who couldn't get the service and just just the same old mundane and the question in my heart was lord what have you got for me what what is there and that was the answer to my question everything clicked then it went back to mundane again had they answered my question okay god there's more that i could do what is it it's not your time to get up there and try to tie the strings and force the needles up let's let's go do something just wait you got your answer okay let's wait let that little wheel keep right on turn them then the time come up invited to go to pakistan and uh and that's all history now and there was none of my doing it was just waiting upon the lord that that little wheel turning turning turning well let's let's let's look back remember those times and then don't forget them today because you and i are both going to be sitting here thinking lord what is there there's got to be something more what what can we do here we are sitting uh covered 19 we can't do anywhere we can't go traveling we can't go ministering what what can we do and it just becomes the same old mundane womp won't but everything's working just right that little meter wheel is turning when the time comes it'll click everything will work unless you go faking it till you make it now you're out now you're in trouble you go trying to fake it till you make it you don't mess with that baler there's everything's got to be in time you don't want anything out of time uh the old baylors that i had were not exactly in perfect time and all the time shearing little bolts that are safety bolts in case something got out of time i should have invested my in them as a stockholder in the company i was buying so many of those things because the old balers wore out and there was too much play and slop and and we would shear bolts left and right but when it's perfectly tuned don't mess with it don't mess with the tension you won't cut your strings your knots won't tie tight don't mess with the timing everything's got to work perfectly just sit back rest let it let it do its thing if you're riding on the wagon you just wait the bail will come to you praise the lord you know when that that plunger is going into that baler when the hay is real thick that plunger may it may only make five or ten strokes and you've got a bale and then five or ten more strokes and you've got another bale and it's just pumping them out and you have to run with that bale to the back of the wagon and put it in place run back and get the next one usually you try to have two guys on the on the wagon so that you don't just wear yourself out running back and forth back and forth but then when the hay gets short later in the season or you've got a field that maybe just doesn't have a lot of hay in it maybe you've had a dry year or a different type of hay just grassy hay or something the hay is not very thick but yet you need to gather it because you got to feed the animals and you may drive a long way and that's plunger may it may make 200 strokes i don't know it may make 400 strokes before it actually brings a bale out it doesn't matter we're not counting strokes we're counting the bale it's not how long you've been in the message or how long you've served the lord or or how much you've done for this or that or what you've given in the oftenness that's not it when you're full you're full when you're done you're done he's not going to pull you out of that baler until you're the proper size but we're in a gleaning time now you know back in the philadelphia and church age your back and brother when brother branham was having the healing ministries there's a lot happening there was you could go to the meetings and i didn't i was before my time but but people were coming to the altar filling the altars up and the word of god was spread around the world during the philadelphia and church age and a lot of things happening we're in a gleaning time and when when you get all the all the field bailed all the windrows have been picked up but there's just little bits and pieces around the edges that maybe got missed they fell outside the baler the tractor driver got off a little bit or the wind blew it and scattered it now i was always one that would kind of go around try to clean it up a little bit so you're just driving driving driving all over and that plunger is just plunging constantly that's when the wagon shakes because there's nothing in there to take the impact and just you're just waiting and you're just going and it's uh seems like nothing's happening but the meter wheel is still measuring each one out and we're in a we're in the gleaming time it may not seem like a lot's going on in your life or around the message or however god knows and his timing is perfect and if we'll just wait on him not faking it till we make it you can go grab that lever you know that lever that i said only goes up about two inches and when it gets up to two in gets up to the top it releases because it's under tension it's under pressure you've got to have test tension and pressure in your life it's under tension it's under pressure and it goes up and then it gets to the top releases that pressure it clutches thrown and everything works perfectly the needles the knotters everything you could go up there and you can grab that lever and you can jerk it up and you get a short bale because it's not time the metering wheel has not set its time but you can jerk it up and sometimes you do that at the end of the season and you need to get all the hay out of there but the last bale is not quite complete it's uh it's a short bale it's it's not tied it's just waiting for more material there's no more material all the material's been picked up it's late in the season it's time to put the baler away you get it running you go out there you pull that thing up everything ties off and then you pull that last bale out of there and it may be just a short one maybe we're just waiting on that last short christian to come in the last last seat of god well he'll know when it's ready and he'll he can pull the lever but but you don't need to be doing that the guy on the wagon he can he can get all the impatience i i i want to stack some hey i'll go down there and pull that up he's gonna have a short bale now what's he gonna do with that it's not gonna fit everything's gonna be out in the in the farmer one in charge is not gonna be happy to have this little short bale we don't want to fake fake it till we make it we don't want to try to manufacture our own experience or however you want to say that when god knows that you've got everything in you that you need that metering wheel will tell it's time and god can seal you and you won't feel fool god's god's metering wheel we can't go jerk that wheel up and get tied and come out a short bale uh no that's faking it it's not gonna work so we may seem it may seem like it's just the same old humdrum every day that plunger just working working working uh and you can look up there and you can see the flywheel going you can see the tines gathering it up and you can see the cross feed tines and the plunger and the knife and everything is working but you you know if you was the knotter you'd say i'm not doing anything lord what can i do i i've got nothing to do you can't do anything you can't do you just wait he said well this brother's doing this and this church is doing that and they've got this ministry over here and i've got this over here lord what's for me wait upon the lord we don't want to impersonate a revelation like well everybody else is shouting and jumping and when when the pastor says this or the visiting minister says that and and i don't get it but i'm gonna jump up and shout too you're faking it forget it let's be honest let's be genuine we god doesn't need fake he doesn't want fake he won't have fake be honest be genuine let god meter out your progress not it's not up to you to determine your progress it's up to him don't try to get ahold of god get ahead of god's program he's got everything time just right just be honest brother bran was honest you know we don't need to perform let's say as ministers brother branham in his early ministry uh he he felt that pressure to perform and i didn't look it up but if i unders i remember right from reading the life story books and hearing his testimony there was a time when he thought he had to get all the worst case scenario healing you know get bring your worst bring your wounded bring your lame bring your halt your blind bring him up here he was under that pressure to perform and he got in trouble for it as the lord said don't do that and he had to mature but after he matured there's no need for that let's just be honest i can't do anything unless the lord shows me jesus said the same thing in john 5 19 the son can do nothing of himself what he seeth the father do john 5 30 i can of mine in myself do nothing i seek not my own will but the will of the father and if that's good enough for jesus that ought to be good enough for us i can do nothing but what the lord shows me and if he hasn't shown you then you can do nothing amen so let's not try to manufacture some kind of a bible study if god hadn't shown anything to to present to the you're wasting their time and and you're being a detriment uh you know it's not just that well it it'll give them something to think about it'll no you're you're being a detriment because you're faking it you're fooling you're duping your uh you're fooling somebody you're fooling a brother and a sister you're fooling a child of god a son or daughter of god does do any of the parents here want to see their children fooled or you wives are you husbands who want to see your wives fooled by the salesman that comes around and i've got the best little product here this you just got to have this and your husband will love you for it and then he comes home you paid watford what well he said it was good no honey let me take that back we don't want to see uh psalm 69 5 that should have been my text i guess i it just was on my heart so that's why we read it don't let me be don't let my foolishness cause a stumbling block you know imitate a message imitate a sermon imitate an anointing or a gift pretend like you're something that you're not you're causing a problem there you're going to cause somebody to stumble and you'll be answering to somebody uh that you don't want to be answered to in that manner we don't need fake uh i pray that we each take this to heart tonight god doesn't appreciate it uh there'll be no rewards for fake christians only condemnation judgment because you're a hypocrite uh you're dead you're worthless that's not really politically correct well that's we're not here to be politically correct we're here this is the house of god and house of correction and if you're being fake uh this is his little uh wake-up call let's let's get it straight let's get it right why go on with forged uh documents when you can have the real thing there's a power in being genuine brother chad read a quote and so this will be a repeat if nothing else has but i know uh these things that the lord laid on my heart was things that brother chad has been covering the past few services before he went on vacation um revelations chapter four verse uh third part three brother chad read this quote brother graham says oh how we need in jeffersonville thousands of lived voices the thunder of god thundering out in sweetness and holiness purity undefiled lies walking around in the earth today without a blemish yes sir real christians that's thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil i wonder if we uh misread that sometimes oh how we need in jeffersonville thousands of voices that's not what bill graham said that's the problem too many voices thundering out he didn't say we need thousands of voices that's the problem too many people out there thundering out their voices trying to make something of themselves and trying to fake an experience committing fraud it's just thundering just thundering voices that's not going to shake the devil brother iran said lived voices we need thousands of lived voices the lived voices that's the thunder against the enemy lived voices the thunder of god thundering out your life your lived voice your genuine christian life is the thunder of god it's not your own thunder it's the thunder of god thundering out your manifested life manifested word in you is thundering out that's the thunder against the enemy the best part what was this and this is what i always liked about this quote how did this thunder sound out we'd think of thunder we think of a big old booming noise that scares little children does it thunder out in power and might arrogance and pride no he says thundering out in sweetness and holiness that'll be the quietest thunder but that's what will move the enemy sweetness thundering out and sweetness and holiness purity purity genuine not making it to you faking it till you make it purity undefiled lies walking around in the earth today without a blemish not faking it till they make it let me read that full quote again oh how we need in jeffersonville thousands of lived voices the thunder of god and thundering out in sweetness and holiness purity undefiled lies walking around in in the earth excuse me in the earth today without a blemish yes sir real christians that's thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away you want to move the devil you want to move the devil in your life you will move the devil out of your brother's life a need in the body this body the body of christ you need to move a devil that's how you do it not by faking it till you make it that's the thunder that shakes the devil that throws him away that genuine consecrated lived life 1956 why are people so tossed about brother braham said i stood a few weeks ago where there was a big tent erected not slamming god forgive where a man said he could cast out evil spirits which i have no doubt of that but evil spirits are not cast out by cruel indifferent living the most powerful weapon there is in the world is love a cruel indifferent living i don't know what the definition of that would be but it's not genuine it's not the real deal it's not what brother branham just described that would thunder out and shake the devil move the devil a cruel and indifferent life faking it till they make it living one life and then coming uh pretending to be something that they're not evil spirits are not cast out by cruel indifferent living think about your life i hope it doesn't fall into the category of cruel indifferent you can't move a devil that way you know you're not gonna be able to pray for a toothache get it healed uh you're not gonna move anything you can't even move that cruel and then different spirit out of your own self you need to become genuine and say lord i i need the real thing so to put it in my words evil spirits are not cast out by fake lines a christian that lives a cruel and a different life is a counterfeit christian a fake hypocrite pharisee dead worthless that kind of life will not move a devil i'd like to be able to move a devil when when i see a devil on myself or brother or sister they have a need in their body or in their life or in a congregation or in a church or for overseas for pakistan i want to be able to move a devil but i'm not going to be able to do it with a cruel and different life anything less than genuine sanctified holy life consecrated to god faking it until you make it it's not going to make it in faith cometh by hearing 1954 brother man says now faith is burly my how i like to think of faith hope faith and charity those three things and hope what a beautiful thing hope is little timid hope lovely and sweet as she is yet she's the greatest enemy faith has that's right the greatest enemy faith faith's got is hope i don't know that i'm real familiar with this quote because a person becomes so hopeful till they leave away from faith well hope's a good good thing right we need to we need hope we do god gave us hope but it can become where a person becomes so hopeful till they leave away from faith it says now hope will agree with the bible hope will say it's true hope will say i believe every bit of it i believe that that's the word of god and i believe that god will keep his promise hope believes all of that but hope then says now i believe that god will heal but look at my condition now faith don't look at that faith comes around i don't care nothing about conditions god god says so and it's mine that's the way faith acts you see faith's burly as i once said faith's got hair on the chest when it stands up and pulls its big muscles out everything else vanishes away just takes flies away when faith really takes a hold nothing else stands i'm telling you faith when you've got you've got to have hope and charity if you've got real burly faith and no love with it you ruin your influence before the people if you haven't got love mixed with it see you've seen people real early what we would say excuse the excuse expression that bulldog faith to grab a hold but it's so rough with it then you see what when you do that it does it hasn't got the kindness there to move with it so what we need is hope faith and charity isn't that right hope faith and charity together god help our church to have it like that the people to have that combination but if you just rely on hope you hinder faith hope looks for something way off but faith claims it right now see faith says god said so and it's mine that settles it see i don't care if i'm crippled if i'm still crippled i'm still blind if i'm still sick that don't have nothing to do with it i believe it anyhow it's mine right now god says so and that settles it that's faith but hope says god says so and i'm expecting to get it someday you see i'm expecting some day and as long as satan can put you off to another day that's as good as he wants that's right you'll never get it just believe that you got it right now it's your personal property faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen is that right faith acts now it's positive there's no oh my i tell you sickness and everything else when faith steps in it's just like a snowball on a hot stove it just melts away everything goes away from faith because faith stands up takes over rule when faith speaks everybody else keeps still that's right and let me read another quote here the anointed ones at the end time what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of god you know it's uh sometimes it's uh we we get that confused in our mind hope and faith and i'm hoping for this but that's the enemy of faith but when you can catch a revelation that god said so it's settled in heaven he's not arguing about it why am i arguing about it i'm not hoping for this it's mine it's my possession now i don't have my healing right now other than i have a promise and that's good enough god's cogs will move around and it'll come to pass because god said so and he's big enough to keep his word and he does keep his word he will move it around but if you're just hoping i'm hoping someday that this will this situation will mend itself and you've got a promise stand on it wait on it believe in it not hope for it not faking it you know faith has substance fake pretend imitations it has no substance when we see a promise of the word of god we can claim it by faith knowing that god keeps his word not hoping he'll keep his word knowing he'll keep his word we've got to have a revelation of that uh that our heavenly father he his promises are true they're good his cogs turn slow but they turn sure don't fake it till you make it you rest on him you wait on him he promised it uh just just get rafe get away from that faking with the musicians come please brother uh blake brother branham didn't have a fake trust in god a fake trust a fake belief would not have held him in his time and trouble you know i was talking about those other ministries back in his day there was a lot of healing ministries and they were some tremendous uh i've i've seen some of the healing meetings online i've they have those recorded and you can you can pull them up some of those other uh ministries back in brother branham's day uh phenomenal uh dynamic uh i mean you could you could pull it up today benny hinn uh doing things bigger and better than brother branham did according to their but he wasn't not bringing the word you know that's the most important thing to us but things happening faking it but then you see those ministries where they get in the tight spot and it doesn't hold and that's just evidence that something's been faked brother branham says in 1965 he said he let my wife die and me holding her by the hands crying for her my daddy in his arm in his arms died on on this arm right here looking up at me trying to get his breath and i prayed as hard as i could how could i face the public again to preach divine healing how could i preach he was a good god and let my own daddy die a sinner how could i preach that i don't know how but i know he's right the word of god shall never fail it'll triumph no matter what that is then i know there was something inside of all the reasons of all reasonings something inside of all emotions everything else like that there was an inside man that held in that hour nothing else could have done it every reason everything could be showed everything could prove that it was wrong and i was in the wrong but the word of god that was predestinated before the foundation of the world held on the inside he had the real deal he wasn't faking it he had the real deal i felt a little wind come through the building her spirit went to meet god brother sister let me tell you that's the only thing don't try to reason it out don't try to have long hair because i said so i don't know that i've ever heard brother bram say that don't try to have long hair well let's read the full thing don't try to have long hair because let's not let's not serve god and walk in this message of the hour and and believe because there was a man named william branham and said it was right let's let you better get something down inside of your heart so it's a real deal otherwise you're just faking it well i'm trusting that brother brandon was right he sounded like and all my friends they said right and this church says it's right and you're on the wrong track you're faking it and that won't hold in the hour of your need don't try to reason it out don't try to have long hair because i said so don't try to do these things just because in your flesh don't try to do it just kind of cope up but just wait before the lord to something way down on the inside many of you think because you've got long hair that means you're going to go to heaven that doesn't mean that many of them think because you're a good moral woman you're going it don't mean that many of them think because of their churches and belong to this and this great group and great doctors of divinity i don't mean that many think because they speak in tongues they've got the holy ghost that don't mean that though the holy ghost does speak with tongues but until that real genuine holy spirit in there will cope with every word if that holy spirit in you that makes you speak with tongues looks back there and doesn't agree with the rest of the word then it's the wrong spirit it's got to come from the inside which is the word from the beginning in the beginning of the creation of god when god began to create bring you into existence you see you started back there as a seed and worked down to where you are now and then you were all in christ and then when christ died he died to redeem all of you and you're a part of this word and how can the bible all of it precept upon precept line up online hear little there little not one jot or little or tittle shall fail how in the world can you being part of that word disagree with the rest of it or any part of it if you're faking it and just relying upon your church association or or some favorite minister with a good ministry and a real genuine gift of god uh to teach or whatever he he if that's all you're relying on you're just faking it you need the reality because nothing else is gonna hold amen let's all stand if you see a promise in the word of god claim it claim it don't fake it claim it make sure all the documents are right send it in and wait on the lord there's nothing you need to do other than believe you don't need to manufacture the promise to you you don't need to manufacture your healing you don't need to manufacture the baptism the holy ghost that's just faking it let's buy our heads heavenly father i just so appreciate lord the thought that you gave me and i pray that it's been delivered in a way that your people will be able to receive it father and it's not uh up to me it's not my responsibility to uh to make it
