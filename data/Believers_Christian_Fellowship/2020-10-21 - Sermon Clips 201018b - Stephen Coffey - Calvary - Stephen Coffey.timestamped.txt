[0:00] but as you go spiritually in the message
[0:01] of the hour you experience
[0:03] amazing things uh that that most people
[0:06] on this planet
[0:08] uh uh uh could never experience
[0:11] um you you experience the presence of
[0:14] god in a way that most people will never
[0:16] have the privilege of experiencing
[0:18] the vast majority of the people on the
[0:20] earth will never
[0:21] be in the midst of a group of believers
[0:23] who are worshiping god
[0:25] as they should and and praising the lord
[0:27] jesus christ
[0:29] and you have that privilege and not only
[0:31] that you you have that privilege
[0:33] several times a week and you step into
[0:35] that and you experience that and you go
[0:37] through that
[0:38] and you have that that that honor of
[0:40] being in that presence
[0:41] you grow in grace and acknowledge and
[0:43] you're you you
[0:44] you are the grace the only grace that
[0:47] the world will ever experience
[0:51] you and and your relationship with
[0:53] christ and them
[0:54] seeing who you are is the is the only
[0:56] grace that they will ever
[0:58] see and you are that grace
[1:01] to them you as a as a result of your
[1:04] uh uh relationship with christ as a
[1:07] result of the
[1:08] presence of god in our midst uh uh
[1:12] you are hidden from the storm that that
[1:14] rages in the hearts of
[1:16] everyone that does not know the goodness
[1:18] of christ
[1:19] you are hidden from that storm and when
[1:22] we think we have problems
[1:23] we are hidden from so much
[1:27] and and however 2020 has impacted you
[1:30] you are
[1:30] hidden and and hidden under the wing of
[1:33] of christ
[1:34] more than you realize you are kept from
[1:38] evil more than you realize god won't
[1:41] tent you more than what you can bear
[1:43] but you are kept from the evil one much
[1:45] more than you could ever
[1:46] understand and then the enemy that lurks
[1:50] in the shadows and
[1:51] and wants to pounce on you and is kept
[1:54] by the grace and mercy of god
[1:57] and you have that privilege
[2:00] you fight the enemy on a daily on an
[2:02] hourly basis but you don't fight the
[2:04] victory
[2:05] fight the enemy for victory you fight
[2:08] the enemy from a position
[2:09] of victory you are victorious
[2:13] you are an invincible army and thus you
[2:16] fight the enemy
[2:17] not for the victory not for the win you
[2:20] fight from a position of the win
[2:22] you've already got the win
