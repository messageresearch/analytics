Revelation Chapter 2 Verse 18 and unto the angel of the church and thyatara write these things saith the Son of God who hath his eyes likened to a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass I Know Thy works and charity and service and faith in thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first may God bless you as you take your seeds may God bless us as we look into his word I mean there's a there's a quote that Drew my attention to the scripture out of the church ages and I started looking at this in detail a couple days ago and I'm so thankful that God gave me an inspiration before everything unfolded so I could start looking because they kept sending me baby pictures yesterday and I said you guys are destroying me you're killing me I'm having a hard time I said if God doesn't help us we're just going to have nothing to preach we're just going to do a slideshow of Henry pictures and be one of those annoying grandparents that everybody cannot stand but thank God God before gave us an inspiration and a direction and it come out of thyatira which is an interesting period of time thyatira was the time of the dark ages for the church and it wasn't um it wasn't it was a time it was the lowest ebb for the true church but it wasn't the lowest ebb for the false church it was actually the highest amen so this is when the Catholic Church came to its greatest power was in in thyatira they ruled the world the Holy Roman Empire was in full swing they were entrenched in many other countries and and they were raising up Kings and taking down Kings they were at their highest or their peak in thyatira but the true church amen if you look at the restoration of the Bride tree those the stages of that insect those four stages has eaten it down to a stump it was almost completely gone the true faith and the True Believers were almost completely eradicated by the false Vine and so it was the dark ages for the truth dark ages for the true church amen but then they come out of there begin a a Protestant reformation and then the the Protestant move took off and there was a restoration of the Bride tree to come to the end time when she would come back to being all that she was intended to do and and the entirely became an interesting study for me I'm not going to get into it we've talked about it before but when you come to the end of laodicea now that Protestant movement has done everything the Catholic Church did in the beginning and so what looked like it was going to be a Protestant Reformation it began the same cycle of corruption and at the end of laodicean church age it will Unite with the Catholic church and go right back to being what it was in thyatira a dominant ruling force that will try to eradicate the truth so there's like a double cycle a cycle for the Catholics and the cycle for the Protestants but at the end of the Protestant cycle comes right back to thyatira amen because we go into darkness because brother manham showed us that that in laodicea they've gone into absolute apostasy amen there's no light there anymore all the light has moved out and gathered into the bride in this last time so it's another Dark Age for the church but it's not a dark age for the bride this time so so that it's it's that's an interesting picture showing what thyatara was and here God comes and and is speaking in Revelation Chapter 2 and going to give an admonition and going to give an Accolade to the uh thyatarian Church age he says in verse 19 I Know Thy Works in thy charity in service and faith in thy patience and thy works and thy last to be more than the first and I was reading in the church age book in the in the thyatarian church age and brother Branham says this he said surely these thyart iron saints were the cream of the crop full of the Holy Ghost in faith created into good works showing forth his praise holding not their lives dear unto themselves but gladly giving their all as a Sweet Sacrifice unto the Lord when I came across this I said uh if the prophet of God can say surely these thot iron saints were the cream of the crop I want to know what makes them the cream of the crop because I believe in the end time what we're going to have is a bride that's the cream of the crop amen it's coming back so when the prophet of God says the tire Tyrant saints were the cream of the crop what made them the cream of the crop why would the prophet say this about these certain Believers so I went back and began to read and begin to study and and ask myself why would he say the thyatine saints were the cream of the crop and and I'm going to read some excerpts out of the church age book as we move forward so now you know my my my thought now you know the premise of my thought so the title today is the cream of the crop and how many would like to be the cream of the crop amen we will never put ourselves there it will be by the grace of God but if if that's what they could achieve in thyatira and that's what God wants to achieve in a bride in the end time I say God I want to be part of that amen so how did you achieve it in the Saints entire attire that's how you'll achieve it in the Saints at the end time amen he says now this is out of the church age book fire time Church age now works will never take the place of faith in God for salvation I want to lay that down as a principle it's important that brother Brown says this in thyatira because the tire and church age was salvation by works by adapting to the works of the church if you do what the church says you'll be saved amen and it came to its peak their entire attire belonging to the church and obeying the church became the means of Salvation in that day so Brethren said Works will never take the place of faith in God for our salvation what what's our Salvation based on faith in God not works faith and gone but works will show forth our faith already placed in him good works won't save you but they will come forth out of a saved life as fruit unto the Lord so the the the the statement that Christ makes in Revelation Chapter 2 says I Know Thy works this was an age that was steeped in Works traditional Works based off the church's order for salvation but he's speaking to the True Vine and he says I know your works you have true works amen because true works are not works that are done for salvation true works are done are works that are based off faith in God Amen they're an outcropping of our faith so so in the age of Works he's pointing to a people who have genuine true works God's Works won't save you you got that God's Works won't save you but they will come forth out of a saved life as fruit unto the Lord I believe in good works even if a man is not saved he ought to do good works and do the best he can what is horrible in the sight of God is for men to do evil works and then say that they are doing the will of the Lord that is what the Bishops and popes and the hierarchy of Rome were doing they were killing maiming and doing all manner of evil In The Name Of The Lord they lived out lives exactly opposite to what the word teaches in that evil day those True Believers Shone like a light in a dark place as they continually did good for they returned cursing with blessing and did the truth to honor God even though many died for him in this verse he is commending his children because they were living changed lives their Works testified to a new spirit within men saw their good works and glorified God yes sir if you are a Christian you are going to do what is right your Works will show that your heart is right and it won't be something that you put on for you will do his will when no one but God sees you oh this is such an important statement and it gets down to the heart of the matter you will do the will you you you will do his will when no one but God sees you and you will do his will even if it cost you your life this is what God was pointing to in the thyatarian church age amen they were they were serving God in this age not for benefits because in this age there wasn't a lot that you could point to in the way of benefits this was the ox age this is when they had to bear under the slaughter and the persecution of the church they were scattered many times not allowed to assemble their property with taken they were in prison they were tortured they were killed all kinds of terrible things were happening to them but they maintained good works through it all they kept serving and loving God through every obstacle and God was pointing out I'm recognizing your works because they're not to get you somewhere because the more you serve God in that day the greater the persecution became and listen and we we live in a day where that which is evil is called good and that which is good is called evil and it's getting worse amen we're in the phase now in the world where there is an ultra tolerance being preached where we tolerate everything but following Ultra tolerance is an ultra persecution for anybody that doesn't follow in the path of ultra tolerance so when we cannot accept amen self-identified genders when we can't accept at wrong marriages we can't accept homosexuality and transgenderism and all of these things that's being pushed when it can't be accepted and even forms of false worship and false religion can't be accepted amen that that that that that Ultra anything goes attitude will then turn on the very ones that don't go with the flow and make everything okay amen so the more you worship God Amen the more you do his works the more you obey him could bring greater persecution greater trials greater pressure amen so it'll be tested I don't know how I don't know I'm making no predictions I have no idea what will happen in the future but you can see the stages being set you can see the the atmosphere all around as as everything goes I mean people will won't make a stand on no subject whatsoever amen they're afraid to offend they they won't even their children are now not even declaring themselves male or female but they're declaring themselves as animals they're identifying as animals and a school school board won't do anything about it a principal won't do anything about it and the parents won't do anything about it they'll tolerate it because they've lost their ability to say what is right and what is wrong so this world has lost its ability to declare right and to declare wrong amen but we're standing upon the word of God and the word of God is always right and anything contrary to it is always wrong amen now it's not a matter of opinion or feeling or personal desire or even our raising or it's come back to the word versus the whole world Amen amen and so if it was a dark age entire it's a Dark Age now later sin has gone into total apostasy declared by an eclipse of the moon where the seventh there wasn't even a seventh picture in the paper there was only six showing the phases of the church ages but when it came to that seventh brother man said why was there no seventh picture because it was a total blackout there was nothing to take a picture of Amen when brother Branham preached the the church ages in 1960. he preaches the church ages and he draws on the board up front the pictures that you see the circles with the Shaded part and light part showing the light diminishing over time and then through thyatira almost being wiped out then he shows the light growing back amen but at the end of the lay of sin he Slants it because it ends in darkness so he showed that God came down and confirmed it on the back wall of the Tabernacle and showed the same cycle of seven uh moons just like was on the platform so it was on the platform was confirmed in the back but after the preaching of the seals amen we come down to I believe it was 1964 when the pope is going to leave Rome and he's going he's going to leave Rome and he's going to go to Jerusalem and he's going to come to the United States at that time there's a blackout of the Moon that brother Bennett says was sent across the papers everywhere and there there's only six pictures there's not a seventh he said God showed it in the sky only now after the preaching of the seals he doesn't show any sliver of light left in laodicea he is outside he's been put out from the church now to come to light you have to go out and Unite with him so there's another Dark Age upon us friends a Dark Age and listen and thigh attire in the Dark Age we don't want to get in our minds that the Dark Age was a non-religious age it wasn't dark because of barbarism it wasn't dark because of heathenism Amen it was dark because of false light false religion was tramping out all the True Light it was dark because the truth was subdued and the false was was in full Glory Full manifestation it was a dark age because the false light was ruling so it wasn't that there was no religion the church was growing the church was powerful amen the the number of members were increasing it wasn't dark because there was no religion it was dark because there was a minimal amount of True Light and we're here where the churches of laodicea have went into absolute Darkness but no scaling back of religion no scaling back of meetings and churches and all of that but an absolute Darkness because they refused the light so in this time of Darkness in this time of Darkness the fire time Believers were the cream of the crop because their service to God was not rewarded by more blessings and material Goods they didn't get an easier life they didn't get better finances a better house better families many times it broke up their families it didn't bring peace to them many times it brought persecution and death and separation scattered churches scattered Fellowship broke open broke apart families imprisonment of that imprisonment of mom separation of the children they weren't serving God in this age for themselves they were serving God for God and to me when we look at what brother I'm saying that's what made them the cream of the crop because no matter what more service more evil more service meant more evil in return amen this was the age amen when the when the corn of wheat had to go into the ground and rot and die when this when the Bright Tree had to come down to a stump with no semblance of life when the ox had to bear under the persecution it wasn't the age of tremendous blessings and tremendous growth it was the age of Burden it was the age of sacrifice it was the age of death that would produce amen New Life and under that cycle they kept serving God anyways they kept serving God anyways they kept doing his works anyways praise God I'm going to read this last sentence in this quote and then continue on he said your Works will show that your heart is right and it won't be something that you put on for you will do his will when no one but God sees you and you will do his will even if it cost you your life says I know your love service faith and patience you will know that their love is placed between works and service and that is the right place for it because without love our works are not accepted before God and neither is our service see that's the fallacy of religion the whole religious concept is built on the fact that if I do religion I will in turn receive favor from God and receive salvation amen but but but what brother Branham is telling us is without love our works are not accepted before God and neither is our service all of those things we do for God and all of those services that we render and the works that we do if they're not done by love they are not accepted by God Paul speaking to the Corinthians said without love I am nothing and whatever I do is without profit unless it is done in love now you can see right here that these Believers weren't in that nicolaitan class that did works as a means of Salvation are to be admired by men I want that to soak in they were not of the nicolaitan class that did works as a means of salvation or to be admired by men we think that's such a terrible thing but I'm telling you that is prevalent in mankind this is the problem with humans this is the plague that plagues Humanity that's why the whole world is religious when you when brother Graham says when they came and they found the Native American Indians with no outside influence he was worshiping a great Creator God Amen when they find when they go to Africa when they go to the Aborigines in Australia they find that they're worshiping amen because man has as a desire to worship he has a need to worship it's put inside of man to worship something amen and many times the worship is is as motivated by self so we become the center of our worship so we worship we do works we do services in order to be saved and to go to heaven or to be admired in the class of people we associate with because everybody we associate with is religious so we become religious to fit in with everybody we associate with and it's so easy to happen growing up in a church amen you grow up in a church and your whole society your friends and everybody all believes the same way and it's so easy to keep doing the things of God thinking that it'll get me salvation and admiration from all my peers Hey listen I don't care who you are in this life everybody wants to fit in and everybody wants to be accepted is that true everybody wants to fit in and everybody wants to be accepted Amen in growing up religious amen can be very very dangerous because the motivation becomes self-centered and we become the central focus of all of our worship just like Cain Cain's worship was Center focused he focused on himself Abel's worship was God focused he wanted to serve God he wanted to do something for God something that would please God Cain's whole purpose and worship amen was to be accepted that's why he was so angry when he was rejected and Abel was accepted he wanted to be accepted but he wanted to be accepted according to what he thought was the best way to worship God what was most beautiful what was most accepted and when he was rejected instead of humbling himself and pleasing God Amen when he spoke with Abel he destroyed Abel because Abel's life was in contradiction to his life Abel's sincerity was a contradiction to his insincerity Abel's love was showing his lack of love so instead of repenting and dealing with himself he tried to destroy the one that was exposing him as wrong and so we have to be very careful and and to all of you growing up all you teenagers and you young adults and your children growing up it's a blessing to grow up in a family that loves God it's a blessing to grow up in an atmosphere that is focused on God and focused on his word it is a tremendous blessing to grow up sheltered from the things of the word world and taught the things of God but if you're not careful you will serve God for the acceptance of the people that you're around to please your parents to please your friends to fit in with the group and to obtain some sort of favor with God and to get something out of God and all of that at the end of the day amen is not going to get you where you want to be it is not accepted by God there's only one way to please God that's when you come to him out of a pure heart because you love him and him alone and regardless of what happens to you in return if everybody around you rejects you your parents kick you out amen all your friends reject you but you serve God because you love him that's the works that he's looking for that's the service that he'll accept amen he's not going to accept you going getting carried Downstream where everybody's going and staying in the boundaries Amen to be accepted that's not acceptable by God what's accepted by God is when you get real with God and say God I love you I want to love you more something in me has to change change Me O God to where I'm not doing service for people I'm not doing service for the ones I associate with I'm not doing it for a return of Merit I'm doing it based solely because I love you [Music] [Applause] amen and if we if we can't get to that point we need to dig a little deeper and dig a Little Deeper until we can get to the point where it says if Mom and Dad reject me if everybody rejects me if I get shipped off to another country by myself if I go with the same heart that I have now I will love him just the same there and serve him just the same there as I do today I'm not doing it because of the collective atmosphere I'm not doing it because of the collective thought I'm not doing this for acceptance I'm doing it because I love you God that was the blessing that the fire tyrants were under their motives were proved by the atmosphere that's why brother Bram could say they were the cream of the crop that's why they could get such an admonition amen from the Lord and and Revelation Chapter 2 because their motives were proved by the circumstances that's why in the day we live in with the peace that we have and the religious freedom that we have and the atmosphere we're in it's so much harder to judge our own motives if you could lose your job for for what you believed if you could lose your home you could have your property seized and you as a daddy could be arrested and separated from your family that atmosphere would prove your motive and so I think it behooves us to take some time to meditate and say God what in this atmosphere it's so hard to judge our motives that we need to take some time to meditate and say why am I doing what I'm doing why am I living the way I'm living why am I making the choices what is the motivation behind these choices what is the motivation behind all my actions because that's the only way that is the only way to have our works and our service accepted by God so I'll read this again you can see right here that these Believers weren't in that nicolaitan class that did works as a means of Salvation or to be admired by men they did their works out of the love of God that was shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost that love in their hearts was God's love for his own Jesus said by this shall all men know that you are my disciples that you have loved one for another the pagans who saw the lives of the early Christians said behold how they love each other John said in first John 4 7 everyone that loveth is born of God let's turn to First John chapter five let's just slip back a little bit here from Revelation to first John chapter 5. first John chapter 5. verse 1. whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that begotten loveth also him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous to us for whatsoever is born of God overcome with the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith so this is the correct order to work because we love God his works are not Grievous to us because we love God the Commandments that he gives us the things he wants to do the the actions the life that he wants us to live and the actions he wants us to take they're not Grievous to us because we love him so it's not a burden to us it's not a restriction to us because it's it's a it's an act of love and an act of love doesn't become a burden or a restriction or a a heavy load it becomes a joy and it becomes a pleasure you know the the if you know with a husband and wife if the wife is only serving her husband and only doing things for her husband to get favor from her husband or to to uh to have something to brag about with all the other women are to look better or to do a better work or you know and you can always spot it from a mile away you know a woman says well the Bible says she Rises early in baked bread I bake two loaves of bread this morning praise God for who who did you bake them for so that you could tell somebody else when you got to church so you can brag about following the scripture you can show that you're a good believer who did you really bake the bread for is it that might be an extreme an example but you run into those examples all the time all the time that you can see the motive isn't right but but when when a woman is secure in the love of her husband she knows she doesn't have to earn his love she doesn't have an Earnest affection amen if if she's having a good day amen he loves her the same but she's having a bad day if she's sick and she's not able to even get out of bed she has the same level of love and the same level of affection that is not based on anything she does but she's secure in his love for her amen then for her to do for her husband is not a trudgery it's not a chore amen it's not a burden it's an act of love it's something she does and if it's anything else than that amen that marriage is under a strain and having problems because it should not be that way it should not be that it's so hard amen it should not be that it's such a drudgery amen for a wife to serve her husband it should be something that pleases her that she's so she's so secure in his love and she has such a desire to him that it's a natural outcropping of her love that she just wants to do something for him amen we see sometimes I get amazed at the things that my wife wants to do for me and I'm like no I can do that myself like I can do that you don't have to do that you're busy I'll do this and she says no no no I want to do it and when she would say something like that to me I'm like my goodness because she wanted to I was willing to do it she was busy I was going to do it in her place but she said no no I want to do it and I began to realize that's exactly what I want to do for God I want to do for him I just want to do something for him I just want to show him my love him I want an opportunity to say I love you amen whatever it is that I can do amen I'm not looking to get something back from him I'm not looking to please anybody else but oh if I just had an opportunity if I knew something would please him it's like David's Mighty Men amen they they loved David so much and they had so much confidence and love and affection for David when they heard David cry out one time oh that I could drink from The Well of the Waters of Bethlehem when they heard it the off they went cutting their way through the Philistines why they had love for David that wasn't a commandment from David that wasn't a chore that they had to fulfill to receive something from David they loved him so much that when David uttered that in a prayer to God they took off to go get him the water from Bethlehem that's how I want to serve God that's the way I want it to be between me and God I want to love him so much and respect him so much that when I see maybe he didn't say Chad you have to go do this but I see he likes that when I see in the prophet's life that he likes that and I see and I see it in the Bible that's what he likes amen I want to be attentive and say that's what he likes that's what I'll do not because he made me amen not because there's a commandment you shall on this day do this but if I can see that that's pleasing to the Lord that's an attitude he likes that's an approach that's pleasing to him I want to do it amen because I love him sometimes I've had so many discussions with people and that leave me scratching my head because sometimes there's an issue and you'll you'll bring the you'll bring the word on the issue and somebody will say was that a heaven or hell issue is that a commandment or is that a suggestion and sometimes I I've been rocked back on my heels because no it's not a commandment like there's no like fire and brims is not going to come out if you don't do this this isn't a commandment you're not going to be under church discipline but I'm showing you something the prophet said was pleasing to the Lord and I'm showing you something out of the scriptures and you say well is that a heaven or hell issue I'm like why are we serving God anyways when it comes down to it what's the whole point do we only want to know the heaven or hell issues I only want to know the things that I need to get to heaven but everything else that that is not a heaven or hell issue there's a problem with the motive behind that kind of service everything so if you love God his Commandments are not Grievous and I would say even Beyond his Commandments if something pleases him then it would please us to do what pleases him because we love him this isn't a have to this is why religion will fail because religion will always come back to the heaven or hell thing and then we're going to have to you know line up our rules and get the Commandments right and find out what is exactly a heaven or hell issue and what what then we're going to have to rate sins we have these sins that are Heaven and Hell and these sins and then becomes a whole form of religion and now we begin to follow a religious order for acceptance because you know I want to go to heaven okay if I do all this I'll go to heaven now if I do this it's not a heaven or hell issue but I could lose a little bit of my reward in heaven and I'm willing to part with a little bit of reward for a little bit of fun in this life so these are a reward issue these are a heaven and hell is you I'll do all of these and I'll see about these now when you present that to everybody nobody's like no no that's horrible but but you know what we're human beings and where every one of us is susceptible to this kind amen when hybridization was the most horrible thing that ever happened to you and I it injected a whole other a whole other set of feelings emotions ideas a corruption that set in and began to pervert Humanity amen and we're all in human bodies and we have to fight all of these selfish self-centered tendencies that come from Pride and we have to be aware of it and fight that and say and it's good to ask ourselves questions why am I doing this why am I doing this why am I doing that why what's the motive behind it and just get down and say God show me Lord show me what if there's any wicked way in me show me what my motive is what my objective is me you know I've prayed so many times God make my heart pure amen thank you praise God I don't think maturity is getting to the place where you can take the World by storm and you know everything I think maturity is when you realize that you can't do anything and that you're a failure to begin with and everything you've tried to do has failed and all of your efforts have fallen short I think real maturity is when we get to the place where you say I am a hopeless creature without the spirit of God I am an absolute failure and an impossibility for me to get right without the spirit of God brother Benham says in God's only provided place of worship he said that every little jot everything you must be faithful in always the little the little foxes that spoils the vine sometimes it's not the big things you do it's the little things that you leave undone remember a chain is only strongest at its weakest link blessed are they that do all the Commandments of God that they might have a right to enter in do all God said and it said for women to have long hair you say a man told me not long ago I Don't Preach a clothesline religion I said then you're not preaching the gospel God laid it out there he said what to do and you either do it that's your natural reasonable thing that little thing that little insignificant Jesus said blessed are they that would take all the little things do the little things and a woman let her hair grow grow that's just why it's just something she can do and she won't even do that she won't even do that oh teach us the great things he's quoting them teach us the great things he said how can you teach the great things when you won't do the simple common things because you see your motive and your objective is wrong brother man could take the statements they were making and and he rephrases his different ways they would say uh uh uh brother Brandon with a gift like yours why are you on these harping on the women about their dress and harping about their hair with a gift like yours you should be teaching them how to receive gifts and how to prophesy and he says if they won't learn their ABCs how are they going to learn algebra so he rephrases this many other ways but right here when he gets down to the statement when they would say teach us great things he says your motive and your objective is wrong you want to learn great things but you're stepping on top of all the little things the reach for the great things showing that your motive something is self something is self-centered in the motive you want to you want to reach a certain level of revelation you want a certain level of understanding you want to get to the big things you want to get to the gifts of the Spirit and the operation of the gifts but you're trampling all over the things that God has asked us to do the simple reasonable things that we can do and you'll step right on that to try to reach for a great Revelation and it shows that the whole motive for wanting more is wrong the whole motive is wrong because we're willing to trample the word of God and the desire of God to get something more from God shows our motive is completely wrong there's something about self mixed in there somewhere brother man when he's he's asked about gifts and he says the greatest gift I know of is love if I could have everything I wanted all the gifts of any gift because I would choose love amen because for every gift to operate correctly it must operate by love so he says he goes on to say uh your motive your objective is wrong it's your love to God lord I don't care what you want me to do I'm willing to do it then you're getting somewhere but if you don't do it that way the way he said do it he goes on in the message perseverance says and the first thing your achievement is only by your motive and your objective so your achievement is only by your motive and your objective your motive has got to be right and your objective has got to be right if your objective is right and your motive is wrong then it won't happen you've got to have the right objective you've got to have the right motive and then take it upon the leading of the holy spirit in your heart and stay with it God will bring it to pass so when you look at motive and objective if you can say Let's Take It on the religious side our objective our objective is to keep the Commandments of God there's nothing wrong with that objective is that a good objective my motive is so that I'll get to heaven now you can see God's not going to bless that although the objective is correct and so so many times we get the correct objective when we don't judge the motive and we think that we're right and God is on our side because we got the right objective but we have the wrong motive right sometimes we have the right objective I'm going to go tell that brother that he's wrong by the word so that he can repent that's the right objective but if the motive is so I can show him so I can get back at him so I can prove I know more than him so that I can be the expert on the subject then it's the wrong motive so no matter how true the objective is if the motive is wrong it's still wrong does that make sense I you know your objective can be I'm going to teach my children amen what God requires and how to dress and how to act and and how to act in public how to carry themselves as Christians good objective but if the motive is so that they don't embarrass me and so we as a family look good in front of the other believers you've got the wrong motive and that thing won't be blessed by God we have to have the right objective and the right motive we got to do it for love I teach my children the ways of God because I love them and I love God any other motive will not come out right amen let's go to Matthew 19 together foreign Matthew chapter 19. and verse 16 19 and 16. and behold one came and said unto him good Master what good things shall I do then I may have eternal life and he said unto him why call us thou me good there is none good but one that is God but if thou will enter into life keep the Commandments and he say them to him which Jesus said Thou shalt do Thou shalt not Thou shalt do no murder Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself the young man said unto him all these things have I kept from my youth what lack I yet I just want you to remember he asked the question verse 21 Jesus said unto him if thou will be perfect go and sell that thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt Treasures in Heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions his objective was fine his motive was wrong he wanted to inherit eternal life but Jesus said if you want to be perfect this is what you'll do and he was he come to the source he came to the one with all the information and he wanted to know he says I've done all this what like I yet and Jesus was showing him where he had a lack in his life amen but that that you know in order to come to Perfection and overcome that lack he was going to have to sell all of his great possessions and give to the poor and come follow Jesus and if his motive had been right for the question he would have sold all given to the poor and followed Jesus no matter how how righteous the objective is or how correct it is in the word amen the motive the motive was proved when he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions it showed his whole motive for asking the question was wrong to begin with he didn't have any desire to serve God to please God to do what God wanted he wanted God to reward him with an eternal inheritance he won an eternal life and I wonder how many people serve God so they can go to heaven instead of serving God because God's worthy to be served how many will obey God for reward instead of obeying God because we love him and he's worthy to be obeyed how many people will sacrifice for God Amen even in paying tithes and offering because there's a promise that he'll pour out a blessing and and that's the true word that's the absolute word but if our only motive and tithe and offering is because there's a reward that comes for that tithe and offering then our objective is right but our motive is wrong because I if God asked me to give him a tithe and an offering I want to give him a tithe and offering if I get nothing in return if that's what he wants I want my heart to give him that that's that's the right objective and the right motive coupled together and how can God not bless that amen praise God so this Rich Young Ruler he had the right idea but he had the wrong motive sometimes I wonder why we come to a message Church why do we believe the message is it because all my family believes the message in order to have a good fellowship with all my family I need to be a message believer wrong motive is it true that if you leave the message it'll affect your relationship absolutely there's no way it can't because you're not in harmony but it's the wrong motive for staying for believing anything for Harmony in a family for Harmony in the home it's the wrong motive I said God help us to get our objective right and get our motive right if we do it because well I know this is right and I want to be right well I mean every human being wants to be right and we know the message is right it's been Vindicated by God but it's just not about finding the right way so that I can be right so that I can tell everybody else that I'm right and so that I can have the satisfaction of being right and so then in every debate or every argument I'll come out right and and I'm right and I'm right and this is right and we're right and everybody's right and the bride is right and we're all right and we could still be all wrong if our motive is wrong I said I believe this message because God put it in my heart to believe it and I serve him this way because I love him and I want that to be my only motive ever and I can't say that it always has been there's been wrong motives there's been right objectives wrong motives all through my Christian wrong but I don't want it to be what I want I want it to come back to the Purity as I love him because he put something in me that can love him back I receive this word because he put something in me that can receive the word I love him and I love his word not because I'm a great person but because he sowed a seeded me before the foundation of the world that could love him and because it's there it makes me love him more amen it makes me more desires to do for him because of what he's done for me and I truly want that to be my only motive I say God still has some work to do on me and I I'm not going to point anybody but I think I'm not the only one God still needs to work on us and we still need to die to ourselves until we can take this wonderful objective that we have and match it with a true motive and come together and see God really move in our lives brother remember says in thy entire church age he said in those dark and Dreadful years the True Vine held its love for God and the love of the Brethren God commended them for it remember it wasn't they had this great works this great love this great service this Faith this patience they didn't have it in the atmosphere you and I have now they had in a totally different kind of atmosphere and that atmosphere would test that love all the time and I don't know what atmosphere will always be in but but God will find a way to test our motives even if he just needs to expose him to us even if God needs for us to see that we've got the wrong motive God will find circumstances he'll find a way to expose the motive because he needs for us to see because we need to repent because God is a gentleman he doesn't come in and rip things out of you you don't ask him to take away and so maybe God allows circumstances in our lives and and you know I think it's funny sometimes the circumstances in our lives and some of the reactions that I've had in the past you know I I get mad at the Devil and yell at him and call him by names try to hurt his feelings try to scare him with my volume trying to make him afraid of me because I'm yelling at him call him names so he knows I'm not afraid of him but if I wasn't afraid of him why was I yelling so much and calling him names and sometimes the circumstances are just the circumstances I've created and I'm yelling at the Devil but God's just a loud circumstances to unfold so that I could see that my motive was wrong or that my objective is wrong something in me was wrong and it was God's Great Mercy that allowed all that to happen and I'm so fixated on hating the devil that I don't realize I'm the problem that if I would if I would lay down my own life and make a full surrender if I would die more to my own self and my self-preservation and my self-love and my self-pride if I would die more than that then I wouldn't be in this problem to begin with this problem yes God allows the devil God gave him free reign yes there's something evil that happened but but God allowed it because I set up the conditions I set the stage by my own self-love my my own desire for self-preservation so God help me to die If thy attire was the cream of the crop how did they get to be the cream of the crop you don't just wake up and say cream of the crop no there was a lot of sacrifice there was a lot of surrender there was a whole lot an entire Tyrant they did not have the Revelation that's been given to us they'd even fully know who they were they didn't even have a realization of God's Great Plan of Redemption and they didn't even see where they fit into the Plan of Redemption but what about this day when God has opened up his mind to us and shared with us his Plan of Redemption who we are where we were before the foundational world and where we fit into the Plan of Redemption my goodness if it that doesn't encourage us just to surrender just to die already and give up because he's showed us what the plan is he showed us what's happening he showed us where we fit into the plan the thyatiran Believers were the cream of the crop and they didn't have any of that they had no idea where they were in the cycle of redemption to the church ages they had no idea the role they were playing they didn't know what part of the prophecy they were fulfilling but in this day we do amen and I say God motivate that to make that motivate me to a greater love amen a greater humility a greater desire to surrender amen you just go back to Revelation chapter two keep reading there Revelation chapter 2. I'm going to read this verse again verse 19 out of the thyroid Church age Revelation 2 and 19. it says I Know Thy works and charity that word's love thy Works charity is love and service and faith and patience in thy works and thy last to be more than the first mother Brown is going to refer to that again and he's breaking it down in sections and he says now he says and I know your faith he said now he does not say here excuse me as he did to the church in pergamon pergamos you hold my faith he is not talking about his faith now but he is commending them for their faithfulness now when he says I know your faith before in pergamon he says you've held my faith I mean that was the Faith of Christ but now he's not saying my faith now he's committing them on their faith and what brother Bram says is he's commending them for their faithfulness and as he does he also mentions their patience now faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness verse says in James 1 3 the trying of your faith worketh patience there is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trial of your faith Romans 5 3 tribulation worketh patience how highly God regards this outwork of our patients is seen in James 1 4 but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect an entire lacking nothing God God's will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God how do we get to where we're waiting on God and for God many times it comes in the form of Trials tribulations persecutions distress amen stresses that's when we're waiting on God and waiting for God Amen and what he told the thyatarians is I know your faith I know your faithfulness and your patience I know how under persecution you're waiting for me amen you're waiting on me and you're waiting for me I mean they weren't running around trying to make political alliances to make their problems go away they weren't trying to fix anything there was nothing they could do to fix it they were patiently staying faithful waiting on God because he was their only hope amen and he says God's will for us is perfection reading this again and that Perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God and you say why am I going through so much trouble because his will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience why is it one trouble after another trouble one child one trial is not done and the other one's Sweeping in it's because his will for us is perfection and that Perfection comes in patience and patience is waiting on God and for God this is the process of character development he says how highly God has commended these Saints of the Dark Ages patient as Lambs led to the slaughter lovingly Faithfully they serve God that is all they wanted out of life just serving service to their lord how great how great was to be their reward let's go to Revelation 19. I want to look at another set of believers I want to look at the end time believers revelation 19. verse 11. Revelation 19 and 11 and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he does judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with the vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God brother Branham said when Jesus comes this time he'll be called the word of God and the white horses he's riding is the word amen so we're talking about Christ in the end time verse 14 in the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth go with a sharp sword that with it he should Smite the Nations that sword is his word and with it he should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadth The Wine Press of the fierceness and the wrath of almighty God and he hath on his Vester and on his thigh a name written king of kings and Lord of lords and when this king of kings and Lord of Lord comes you'll be riding on a white horse the word his name will be called the word of God out of his mouth will come a sword which is the word of God it's the coming of the word the coming of the Lord amen and with him are the armies of Heaven let's turn back to revelation 17. Revelation 17-13 these have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the Beast talking about the Ten Kings these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful God commended the thytime Believers because he knew their faith and he knew their patience and now brother Branham is referring to the scripture that we read and and he's in the seals he's in the fourth seal and he says he's got wrote Life riding on a white horse he's taking that from Revelation 19. brother Branham is going to connect Revelation 19 in the scripture in Revelation 17. he's going to put them together and he's got life riding on a white horse and there's a man with three different powers mixed up Called Death Gathering his Earthbound delegates and Christ is gathering as heaven-born subjects Saints are you a heaven-born subject then he's Gathering you he's got death thrown on him Christ's got Life Run on him those with him are on white horses also and they are called The Chosen before the foundation of the world and they are faithful to the word and woo I like that one called chosen before the foundation of the world and then faithful to the word by their choosing all stimulated with new wine and oil just riding Right Along coming down to meet him they know the Thunders will issue the thing course pretty soon here we find the end time Believers the followers of the word the the followers of Christ the word the one who's on the White Horse the one who is the his name is called the word of God Kings of kings and Lord of lords with the sharp sword that goeth out of his mouth following after him are his heaven-born subjects the followers of the word and they are chosen amen they are called they are chosen before the foundation world called amen by the message at the end time but then he says but faithful of their own choosing this is what he looked at the Believers in thyatira he's saying now you held my faith but I know your faith amen your faithfulness and your patience Amen to stay faithful to me in the midst of every obstacle in all darkness and all persecution I know your faith I know thy faith and thy patience and here we see the end time believers they are called they are chosen but they are faithful by their own choosing God has a law and that law of God is free choice he put us in that law free moral agency free choice he says we're given freedom to make our choice and I want to be one of those that are found faithful by my own choosing amen I don't want to take the law that he's given the opportunity he's given us to make our own choice to use it to choose to serve myself but I want to make that choice to serve him and God doesn't want a bride that has no option he wants a bride that has an option and in the option she chooses him amen he wants a bride amen coming up under free moral agency not where she has no choice but she's forced into a certain action she's forced into a certain service amen you don't want a wife like that I don't want a wife like that nobody wants a wife like that he wants a wife amen that has a choice she can make her choice she can serve herself or she can serve him but she chooses to serve him and that pleases him it's like what can I do to please him he's God of all Heaven and Earth and you know God gets angry God gets upset God gets offended and God is pleased read the Bible God is pleased God becomes Angry God gets offended amen so our actions can please God can offend God can make God angry can bring him pleasure and I say I want to use the law free moral agency and the love that he's placed in my heart and I want to choose his word over everything else in my life amen though it slay me I want to please him I want to buy my own choice amen there's so many times I've prayed in the past God if you would just make me how many get frustrated with yourself say God if you would just make me just make change me make me amen just make me only say positive things make me make me only make good choices make me only think pure thoughts amen but God is not taking away the law of free moral agency amen he's not taking away completely the effect of the curse and hybridization but we're here in it we're here in Satan's Eden and what can please God is in the midst of all the choices with free more latency when I choose to deny myself and take him and please him and not please me that pleases God he accepted able sacrifice because Abel waited to find out what God wanted he rejected Cain because Cain never waited he just brought what he wanted I said God let me lay in this word and see what you want and help me to make my choice for the right objective for the right motive and just do something to please you if I get nothing in return that was the attitude of the prophet of God the prophet of God told us that if after all this life I serve him and he sends me to hell if I go with the same spirit I have now I'll love him just the same let's go to Galatians chapter 5. Galatians chapter 5. Galatians 5 and 6. for Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but Faith which worketh by love so what works faith is love brother Ben's going to explain that here in a minute but but first there's a quote here out of the Prophet Elijah from 54 he says when you find unbelief it's accompanied by hatred if you find Faith it's accompanied by Love For Love creates faith love creates Faith love brings faithfulness he says here in perfect faith and Faith In Love is a is relation because you can't have faith unless you got love because your faith is in a God who is in the very essence of love faith and love works together here just like a young couple you take a young man and a young woman and they love they fall in love with one another and as they go along and begin to know one another more their hearts just begin to beat as one they're yet they're not husband and wife but their love binds them together and they have confidence in one another now if they really love one another really love and you know that this girl loves you and she knows that you love her You've Got Confidence faith in one another and if you've got faith in one another if you didn't you'd better not marry her see notice you got to have faith and you separate them and put them one extreme South and one extreme North there's still that love that beats for one another no matter where they're at they're just as true to one another as they can be because they love one another and if you love the Lord just not trying to dodge hell but you love the Lord then you have faith in God see if you love him how do I have faith how can I be found faithful I have to love him first how can I love him because he first loved me amen amen it makes me love him back my love is a reciprocal love and I love him with all my heart and it creates a faithfulness in me and I judge him faithful and I want to be faithful back to him because I love him it goes so far beyond will I go to heaven or go to hell now it's got to go beyond that because in a marriage it's got to go beyond will he put me away in divorcement or will he keep me what kind of love what kind of marriage is that if a man says honey could you iron my shirt she says well will you divorce me if I don't well if you're not divorced man I won't do it well you say well ah you know the grocery budget I give you if you start ironing my shirts I'll increase it by 40 bucks a week okay I'll iron your shirt what kind of relationship is that that's not what any of us want do you think God wants that if we don't want it do you think God wants that you think God wants the relationship where aim listen You'll Never there's things that go on in your mind that will never come out loud there's Wars that rage inside of you when you're faced with difficult decisions where you really get the rubber meets the road and you're really going to have to lay down your pride and sacrifice you're gonna have to be honest amen you're gonna have to expose yourself or or take the word of God in a way that that makes you contrary to everybody around you and when you do that thing there's Wars that go on inside of you it's like well I mean if you didn't God would love you anyways he would never cast you to hell because God can no more be lost you can no more be lost and God can be lost you heard names on the Lamb's Book of Life I mean and then these little Wars these little demon voices start going off in your head amen then God will love you anyways you don't have to do this nobody in the church will know who cares if nobody in the church will know I mean if that thought comes in your mind amen you can recognize there's a devil right there amen whispering in my ear I don't care if anybody in the church knows or doesn't know or will ever know amen I want my motive to be that I cannot stand to displease a God who has loved me this much I cannot stand to offend him to hurt him to cause him any displeasure when all that he has done for me I don't care if nobody ever knows that I did this I don't care if anybody ever knows that I make it right or don't make it right or whatever the circumstance is God will know if nobody else knows and that's enough for me [Music] yes yes how many things are done because we don't want the other people to think what will the church say what what will this family think and God sits there unconsidered and the wrestling of our minds well I might lose my job and I might this and that and God goes unconsidered in all the Warfare in my mind instead of my first consideration it would be him I'll lose my job that's fine but I don't want to displease God I may lose a relationship I may lose a friend but I don't want to lose my friend and God it's the one that matters the most to me above everything else friends whether no matter what we think amen this is the place this bride has to come to this is not optional in the end time she's got to come to this place where he is considered above everything else where he comes first where we choose of our own free choice to serve him first above everything else back in the thytime church age he finishes the scripture he says I Know Thy works and the last to be more than the first this is the second time he mentions The Works he started off with works then he went to love and service and faith and patience then he comes back to Works in thy works and the last of me more than the first prophet of God says this is certainly remarkable as the darkness of the age increased as the honor roll of the martyrs grew lengthier day by day they worked all the harder they served all the more and their faith increased how tragic it was that in the Ephesian age love waned and truly nothing is said of the increased labor of love in other ages think of this the Ephesians age they lost their first love they they stopped being so concerned about what God thought and they started becoming concerned about what the group thought and their love began to wane in the Ephesian Church age and then he says no and truly nothing is said of the increased labor of love in any other age so no other age was talked about and I Know Thy works and the last to be more than the first meaning you're doing more than you started off doing is there any other age where he said that no every age was diminishing as the Revival fires found begin to fade away but this one he says and I Know Thy works and thy last to be more than the first there was an increase of Labor of Love in the thyatiron age but he says but in this age in the darkest of all ages they served him even more what a lesson that is there is no ceasing of this gracious service of Love unto the Lord but rather an increasing of him that is the secret let the enemy attempt to thwart our service to the Lord our reply is increased service when the faint are crying in fear that is the time to shout the victory when it's getting worse that's a greater opportunity to serve him when the persecution comes on more it's a greater opportunity to show God you love him to serve him the more brother Graham says in the message Christ is revealed in his own word he says I've been this week down in the country staying with some very dear friends I asked some of them at the table yesterday when we was eating we always sit around and like a little study on the Bible we was talking about love and there was a certain person said to me he said I believe you're an antichrist so brother M's referring to somebody had told called him an antichrist and here's his response I said if that would be pleasing to my Lord that's what I want to be I have some growing to do in the Lord because I want to live this way this is what I want out of my life I want what God desires to be my greatest desire that's what I want God showed it to us in the life of a prophet he displayed it before us showing that all the potential that brought this to maturity is here the full word is here to bring all of us to this kind of maturity but this is where I want to be friends I said if that would be pleasing to my Lord that's what I want to be I want to be whatever he wants me to be I love him and if he should cast me into hell I still will love him if I go with the same spirit I have now he looked at me kind of strange I imagine he would if he called you an antichrist and that was the response but see when you get to this place people can't hurt you when you get to this place and somebody looks at you and says you're this and you're that and you're this and that and you can say I never was much to begin with I'm only what he makes me and whatever he wants me to be is what I want to be praise God then he says I've seen four or five of them there young men young wives fine women I note how them boys loved their wives so I said to them I said here is the way to test it he's talking about the right kind of love for God here's the way to test it if your wife excuse me before you were married now you go back and say this married life you you've been dreaming you were married you really wasn't married but you dreamed you were and you woke up and you went and talked it over with your girlfriend and said you know I dreamed that we were married and we had children and we living happy and we living happy and waiting for the coming of the Lord and everything and then this girl would say to you you know I love another man better than I love you I could be happier with the other man could you from your heart love her well enough to say God's blessings rest upon you my dear go with this other man now now check that each of you men you you women what if your love is correct you would do that for you are interested in her welfare you know what the incorrect kind of love would do hate the guy she likes get angry with her for not loving you for wanting to prefer this other man and trying some scheming way to get him out of the picture so you can have her that's the wrong kind of love but that's the love that motivates most humans and they call that love and it is a form of love but it's the wrong kind of love because God's love always always is self-sacrificing look at God God is self-sacrificing his love he gives of himself for the ones that he loves amen and that would be the wrong kind of love the right kind of love would be to say if you would be happier with that other man and that's what you want I love you so much then I would want you to go be with that other man though it would kill me amen you see that kind of statement's not saying I'll be fine that's okay with me it doesn't have to be okay with you it can kill you it could rip your heart out you can cry a whole month over it amen but the right kind of love is willing to suffer that kind of pain to let somebody else amen go with what would make them happier that's the right kind of love so even this is how brother man begins to explain that so he says well if your love is correct you would do that for you are interested in her welfare but you know you know you could have her you can live with her she's your wife she would be she'd marry you but she won't be happy she'd be happier and then if you love her then you want her to be happy therefore whatever the will of God is let's God's will be done whether I'm happy with it or not I want to live so he will be pleased pleased with me with what I do therefore check your objective and your motive by that you know whether you love God or not what if he'd say you serve me if I'm going to cast you cast you away I love you anyhow if you're going to cast you away I love you anyhow amen and brother Benham said that's the right kind of love that's the kind of love that we should emulate amen there was a a whole religious order in the day in Jerusalem the day Jesus showed up to begin his ministry and that whole religious order claimed that they were lovers of God and lovers of his word and here was God standing in flesh the Fulfillment of the word and Jesus says if you love God you would love me for I came out from God but what they loved was Prestige what they loved was position what they loved was the long flowing robes and the long prayers on the corner and people treating them with respect and honor they loved their position with the with the the situation that they had with Rome amen when Jesus began to work out Miracles amen they had a private Council and how they would destroy him because he says if this continues Rome will come and will lose our place and our nation they weren't even interested that people were being healed and blind eyes were being opened and the sign of the Messiah was being performed what they were doing was guarding their position and their Nation showing that the one that they really loved was themselves not God and Jesus called this out in the Book of John if you loved God you would love me also how can you say you love God and you seek to kill me a man that has told you the truth you see if they really had the right kind of love for God they would have lost their Nation to have God lost their position to have God lost everything just to have him that's the way I want to live when it comes to to showing our works our works are based off of faith and our faith is based off of love let's go to First Corinthians chapter 13. it's a very familiar scripture but I love the characteristics and attitude and the approach of the right kind of love First Corinthians 13 and 1. though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I become a sounding brass or tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing let that soak in let it really soak in if I could move mountains if I could give prophecy if I could sell them if I had great sounds and speak in tongues if I could do every Mighty gift that could be done but I don't have love I am nothing the end of the day it doesn't matter verse 3 and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing all my works all my services all my Deeds all my gifts without love profit with me nothing leaves me as nothing verse 4 charity love suffereth long and is kind love envieth not love vaunteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not an iniquity but rejoices in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hope with all things endureth all things charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall seeks whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away let's go down to verse 13. and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity look at the description of love love suffers is kind love is not jealous love doesn't faunteth itself doesn't put itself up is not puffed up it's not vain it's not proud doesn't behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own but always seeking the welfare of others is not easily provoked doesn't get angry every time you bring some criticism doesn't get upset every time you bring a correction he say it's not easily provoked and thinketh no evil Rejoice is not an iniquity but rejoices in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hope all things endureth all things charity never faileth you know what I need more than anything else in my life the love of God I need the Capstone love of the very love of God is the only thing that's going to make it through to the end every gift must operate by love every work must be must have the motive of love every service to God must be done by love if it's not done by love it's vain if it's not done by love it leaves you as nothing if it's not done by love it profit of you nothing amen all of our service all of our works all of our gifts all of our giving without love is nothing so what do we need greater than anything else in our lives we need the love of God Amen [Music] we need love said in the latest in church age just don't forget don't forget that the greatest gift of all gifts is love if you want to pray for anything say God give me more love and not this filial love that becomes passionate angry and upset and claiming and wants to own and hold no give me the true love charity God's love give me your love for everything must be motivated by love everything must work by love Faith worketh by love and everything in the kingdom of God is apprehended by faith but Faith workers by love I have got to have love God give me more love fill my heart with love and root out all of bitterness all Pride all selfishness get it out of me and pour your love into me gone God is love so if you receive love you receive God and if you receive God you receive love that's why how can we receive the message which is Christ which is the word of God how can the message make us angry and bitter and and contentious and bring strife and is that the attribute of God but this is the word of God this is Christ Christ is God's love amen how can I receive the message and how can I return around receiving the message and act in bitterness and act in strife and act in Pride in vain glory and all the how can I take the message and try to put everybody else down and put me up higher amen it's not the nature of love love does not Bond itself it's not puffed up amen seeketh the benefit of others so if I've received the message I should receive the life of the message which is the Life of Christ which is the life of God which is the spirit of God and God is love amen and God is the word and the word is love and the word coming into me should bring a greater love in my life and that love in my life should give me the ability to make myself a sacrifice to please my Lord the greatest of all gifts is love though I speak with tongue of men and angels and and have my body to be burned as a sacrifice understandeth all knowledge and so forth I am nothing but when that which is perfect which is love if all the spiritual gifts isn't mortared together with love it won't hold any other mortar will break away but love continueth forever see that is the first Corinthians 13. brother Branham says here referring to the incident where he stepped into a diner to have a sandwich and he saw the sin taking place and he saw the older sister there with the policemen and the drinking and the smoking and he began to condemn it in his heart this is what he said he said God showed me that in my heart wasn't right because I was trying to condemn her and not looking at what I come from too so we can always remember look back to the pit where you was hewed from things will look a lot different see we don't want to condemn no one love everybody whenever you lose that real genuine love that's in your heart you've lost everything don't think that we can let the love leak out but I still have gifts I've lost the love but I still have the word no he says when you lost the love you've lost everything people say I I have the word I've got the word the word is right I'm right on this subject I've got the word but if you don't have love you don't really have the nature of the word you have a certain understanding of a certain Doctrine or a teaching you've got a uh you've read certain words and heard the prophet or a minister say certain things and you've got maybe the correct understanding of terms or you got the correct understanding of a certain teaching a Doctrine amen but without the nature of that word you don't have the word do you understand me without the nature of that word you don't have the word amen what you have is an intellectual understanding of a Doctrine and that understanding may be correct but if it doesn't bring with it the life of that word you don't have the word but to have the word is to have the life of the word and the word must be lived administered taught with the right life and that life is love I said God help us help us the word must be taught with love the word must be received with love the word must be shared with love I look back on my life and wonder how many of my failed attempts at witnessing and some of them were big failures how many times I failed at witnessing because I didn't witness out of love I witnessed out of being correct you hear a discussion going on at the table next to you somebody asks you a question and you know the answer and all of a sudden my witnessing becomes my desire to prove to them that I'm correct and my need for them to acknowledge that I'm correct and that becomes the whole basis for witnessing but it wasn't my love for a soul it wasn't my desire to see somebody get closer to God now if you were to ask me I would have said that was we've learned how to say the right things when our hearts going a different direction but the reality was is I was right I knew I was right and I needed this guy to agree I was right and somehow if he agreed it was right he might go to heaven I wonder how many times I failed in witnessing because I didn't witness in love I witnessed in my own Pride no wonder God didn't melt the heart of the person I was talking to they were receiving not the word they were receiving intellectualism with my pride so what were they resisting the word no they were resisting my pride that's why when you witness that way and somebody doesn't agree with you you can get upset how many started witnessing and wound up in an argument praise God I should just have an altar call right now but God motivate me by love God I don't anymore want this hybridization to rule my life I want your spirit to control everything in me I want your love I want every action to be motivated because I love you because I want to please you I don't I'm not after the reward I'll be thankful for it I'm not after the reward I'm not after salvation I believe by faith I have those things already but that's not what's motivating me anymore I don't want to be motivated by those things I want to be motivated by my love for God that I serve God because I love him I obey him because I love him amen I tell others I Proclaim of his goodness because I love him I share the word because I love him and if I share with another individual I have to share it because I love them too foreign remember God so loved the world he sent his only begotten son if you've lost that real genuine love that's in your heart you've lost everything don't ever forget that that when you lose love it's all gone say God keep us in love with you keep pouring more love into us God help us to surrender and lay down all that foolishness that's been bred into us all the the pride and the self-love and all of those things but I want to lay it down help me God fill me with more of your spirit as I feed on your word day by day if we receive the right word that word brings with it a life because it's the life of the word and the life of the word should be able to live that life through each of us amen let's turn to First John chapter 4 together we'll wind down with this I want to read two scriptures as we close first John 4 first John 4 17. here and as our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is in the so as he is so are we in the world there is no fear and love but perfect love cast out fear because fear at torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us If any man say I love God and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love God whom he hath not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God loveth his brother also you know there is no fear in love so I cannot come to God and serve him out of love if I'm serving him because I'm afraid that he'll condemn me to hell he's already answered that question he's already paid the price and he's freely given us salvation and he's given us a heart to be able to believe by faith in the price that was paid on Calvary and so now there's no motivation fear is a terrible motivation if I make decisions because I'm afraid God will judge me I'm afraid God will condemn me I'm afraid God will cast me away that's a very poor motivation amen but if I didn't make decisions because I want to please God and I want to I want to show him I love him and I want to do something for him that's a that's a pure motivation and it'll bring totally different results and responses in US one we do for us one we do for him and one set of circumstances everything we do we do is for us we we serve God so we can go to heaven that's for us we serve God so we can get rewards that's for us we serve God so that we won't be a Castaway that's for us we serve God so that we won't be judged that's for us we serve God so that we'll get the benefits of serving God that's also for us and I would say that's how the majority of human beings serve God would you agree and I would even admit at times that's how I serve God but the other side is if I get nothing I'll serve him I'll love him because he's God and I believe this word because it's the truth and I want to live it because I know it's right and if at the end of the journey I get no reward for it I still want to do it because it's right amen I love him because he's beautiful amen the picture that he's painted as he's opened his mind and shared his mind makes me love him more every Doctrine makes me love him more because I see how perfect God is how loving he is how much he has provided amen and every Doctrine causes me to love him more amen the opening of The Seven Seals on opening of the entire Bible made me love him more and gave me a greater desire to please him if I hear him cry out amen if I could have but a cool drink of water from The Well of Bethlehem I want to be one that will run and fight and risk my life to get him a cool drink of water because it wasn't for a reward it wasn't for because the the forego punishment they only did it because David wanted it and I want to serve God because he's worthy to be served because he's perfect because he's beautiful because his word is right I want to buy every word because it's right not so I can get something out of because it's perfect I want to obey every word because it's true and because I love him and I love his word and I love everything about him and if I get nothing in this life that's still okay with me that's the way I want to serve God I want to get so far away from this self-focused service to God and I want to get all the way over here I don't know where I am in between but I'm asking God to move me God help me help me to serve you out of a pure heart let's go to First Timothy chapter one First Timothy chapter 1 verse 5. in the end of the Commandment is Charity love out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned we come to the end of it all this is the goal the end of the Commandment the end of everything what is the end of it all the end of the Commandment is love what is God looking for love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned unfame means without hypocrisy with no pretending what is God looking for love out of a pure heart no selfish motives mixed in and a good conscience for the right reasons and a faith without hypocrisy that's the end of the Commandment and there's going to come an end in the end time in the end time bride and I believe by the grace of God by the prophecy that he's given that he's going to have a bride that will love him correctly that will serve him for the right reasons and I want so bad to be one of those that bring pleasure to my Lord and let's all stand musicians if you'd please come the the relationship that we have with the Lord the real one the genuine one is not the one we have at church the walk that we have with our God is not the one we have in church the real relationship we have with the Lord is not the one we have with other believers but the real relationship we have with the Lord is the one we have when it's just him and I and nobody's listening and nobody's around and nobody knows that's the genuine remember when brother Branham went to the couple of the the he saw those two couples that he married one in the boxcar by the river and one up in the Ivory Tower one up in the palace on the hill he snuck up and he was listening and he was catching their private moments amen when nobody was listening they thought nobody was around and nobody knew and what did he experience there he experienced a young man and a young woman that truly loved one another was willing to sacrifice for one another a man that wanted to give all that he had to buy his wife a new dress and a woman that says oh that's all right I don't really need it anyhow she was preferring him he was preferring her she was sitting on his lap he had his arm around her they were loving one another and preferring one another that's who they really were that was the real marriage then he slips up to the Palace to the to the the Mansion on the hill and he hears them a fussing and quarreling and they're fighting about some girl he danced with or some boy she danced with amen and brother Branham knocked on the door or whatever it was that he did and all of a sudden he sees him jump up and they run across the floor into each other's arms they go well hello brother Branham how are you he says I'm doing well how are you we're fine aren't we honey yeah yeah we're doing wonderful they made a public appearance but it was a lie what they were in their marriage when nobody was around is who they really were that was the real marriage it didn't matter what show they put on for people how they walked hand in hand in public what they were in private when nobody was listening the way they spoke to each other the way they loved each other the way they preferred each other the way they treated one another when nobody else knew that's the real marriage the same thing for us and our Lord when nobody knows what you're saying to God what are you saying to God are you saying anything is there any relationship outside of the group relationship is there any time spent with the Lord is there any communication with him is there any prayer time is there any meditation time is there any time in his word or is the only time that we serve God and the only relationship we have with God is that church earned the fellowship of other believers I wouldn't want a marriage like that would you only have a public marriage no private marriage but what we are when nobody's listening when nobody's around when nobody's included that's our relationship with the Lord and I said God that's what I want to be as real as real can be I want that relationship go real all the way to the Core and I wanted to be motivated by love not by fear nobody's going to come up to you and say how much how much time did you spend in prayer today this is all based on love nobody's going to ask you how many hours you spent praying nobody's going to ask you what you read today nobody's going to ask you those questions those are private things between you and God but that's what I want to be real all the way through from top to bottom that's the one that matters most to me and that's that's the real relationship and I said God may you give it to each one of us May he's willing friends now the question is are we willing he's always faithful but who will be faithful of their own choosing I said God make me help me pour your spirit into me help me overcome myself to come to this place that I want to be let's bow our heads and pray dear Lord Jesus we thank you oh Father how we can we can never thank you enough Lord no matter how much love we have on our Heart Lord we can never out love you you loved us more you loved us first you loved us before there ever was a beginning and in this Consciousness that we have now Lord we're only now learning of your great love and God you place something in us a capacity an ability to hear your voice in this day you placed in us the ability to love you back God I love you with all of my heart God I raised my hand to you and tell you I'm sorry Lord sorry for my pride I'm sorry for my selfishness I'm sorry Lord for

thing is not what God's after we still have church because he told us to we still gather as an assembly we have a fellowship of Believers because that's what we were taught to do in the word but church is not what God is after in this hour it's a relationship with his bride it's got to go beyond the church it's got to go beyond the group it's going to come down to the individual connected with the Living God with a vibrant relationship where there's love that's motivating all that we say and do this is the hour for it it's not this is not preaching an unattainable goal this is not preaching something that's not within our reach this is what the word is producing in our lives it's producing it day by day as we feed on that word amen as we Fellowship around it as it's in our ears and in our hearts amen as it's preached and as we listen to the tapes and read the books and read our Bibles amen what's happening is Christ is becoming more relevant more real more pertinent to every moment of Our Lives the relationship is growing and he's becoming the central theme of all of our walking all of our talking all of our thinking and all of our affections this is for us this day to have a bride that loves him more than she loves anything else and I want to be part of that bride I consider myself privileged to be alive in this day for I know the potentials are here because I know
