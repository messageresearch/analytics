[0:00] the whole thing is God and man one God
[0:03] and man was one there and God and man is
[0:06] one here
[0:07] what is it being filled with his Spirit
[0:09] him having the preeminances that was
[0:12] God's achievement that's God's purpose
[0:15] to do that that he might be in Christ
[0:17] and Christ in us and all of us together
[0:20] one
[0:23] this is God's achievement
[0:26] this is God's purpose
[0:29] and now we we have to continually like I
[0:33] said make God's purpose our purpose
[0:36] because God's purpose is the correct
[0:38] purpose if you want to know what your
[0:40] purpose is in this life this is your
[0:42] purpose amen that that Christ would live
[0:44] in you that Christ would Express through
[0:46] you that Christ would manifest through
[0:48] you that by the new birth you'd be part
[0:50] of that new creation that new race amen
[0:53] a super race a super church not where
[0:55] you have something to do but where he
[0:58] has something to do in you amen his life
[1:01] in you your life gone surrendered laid
[1:04] down and now his life taking preeminence
[1:07] and taking control that's God's
[1:09] achievement that's God's Great purpose
[1:11] amen that's the continuation of the
[1:13] creation of God that should be our main
[1:16] purpose
[1:19] not religious rhetoric
[1:22] not a pep rally not words that make
[1:25] people feel good I can stand up here and
[1:27] start screaming about your Egos and and
[1:29] this and that and get everybody so
[1:31] excited but if you're excited about
[1:33] being an eagle and excited about being
[1:34] bride but you go out Monday and live the
[1:37] old life the old nature there's no
[1:39] there's no new race amen there's no new
[1:41] creation amen what was the purpose of
[1:43] the pep rally the purpose of coming to
[1:45] church is not just to get excited and
[1:47] feel good and go home having got a dose
[1:50] of medication it'll make you feel good
[1:51] for another few days but the purpose
[1:53] brother bear says we come here to see
[1:55] our bad parts we come here to see where
[1:57] we need to grow where we need to change
[1:59] we come here so that we can realign with
[2:01] the purpose of God and stop getting
[2:03] distracted by other things
[2:06] so that Monday morning we wake up and we
[2:08] know when your feet hit the floor what
[2:10] am I alive for what am I here for why am
[2:13] I in this time why has this word been
[2:15] revealed to me what am I doing on this
[2:17] Earth and what is God's Great purpose
[2:21] amen
[2:23] we can have a good time but I don't want
[2:25] a good time with no fruit
[2:27] I want fruit in my life I want this to
[2:30] be a living reality I want it to be
[2:31] genuinely amen the continuation of the
[2:35] creation of God
