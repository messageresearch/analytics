[12:13] flesh be
[12:16] all
[12:19] forsaken at the

[15:05] my word is my

[15:13] more revelation.
[15:20] Amen. Let us just
[15:25] pray. Father, we so thankful for your
[15:29] presence. We thank you for the songs of
[15:31] Zion that we
[15:33] sing. We pray that they are sweet
[15:36] smelling savior to
[15:39] you. Give me more revelation. Amen. As
[15:42] the prophet said, not just the book of
[15:46] revelation but all
[15:48] revelation. Cuz Lord, when something is
[15:50] revealed to us, we can see
[15:53] clearly. And then we realize only you
[15:56] can give revelation. The scripture tells
[15:59] us flesh and blood not reveal these
[16:01] things unto you, but my father which is
[16:03] in
[16:04] heaven. And that's why we should pray to
[16:07] you cuz there's no one can give us
[16:09] revelation.
[16:10] only you can give it. So we pray this
[16:14] morning, oh God, that you would just
[16:15] help us to just get oursel out of the
[16:18] way and that you uh can speak to the
[16:21] hearts of your people. We thank you for
[16:24] all things, dear God, and we give you
[16:26] the praise and honor and the glory. In
[16:29] the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. And
[16:32] the church says,
[16:35] "Amen." Amen. Thank you,
[16:38] musicians. Amen. Amen. God bless you
[16:40] this
[16:42] morning. Amen. We bring you greetings
[16:45] from the church back home. Amen. Uh we
[16:48] just we're all just pressing in this
[16:51] battle.
[16:52] Amen. I appreciate brother Chad for
[16:55] giving us the opportunity to come here
[16:56] to minister the word of the Lord, the
[16:59] words of life. And I just pray that you
[17:02] would just pray for me. Amen. If you
[17:05] will.
[17:07] Uh we want to just turn to a scripture.
[17:10] Let's go to re Revelate Romans 7 and
[17:12] we'll just see what the Lord do from
[17:21] there. Romans 7. It's good to see
[17:23] everyone. Been a while since we've been
[17:26] been up this
[17:27] way and uh but by God's grace, we're
[17:32] here. Amen.
[17:37] Let's go to Romans 7
[17:43] verse14. He said, "For we know the law
[17:45] is spiritual, but I am carnal sold under
[17:49] sin. For that which I
[17:51] do, I law not. For what I do, that do I
[17:56] not, but what I hate, that do I. If then
[18:01] I do that which I would not, I consent
[18:03] unto the law that is good. Now then is
[18:07] no more I that do it, but sin that
[18:10] dwelleth in me. For I know that in me
[18:13] that is in my
[18:14] flesh dwelleth no good things. You know
[18:18] he said but sin dwelleth in me but he
[18:23] said for I know that in me he said that
[18:26] is my flesh. Paul is not talking about
[18:30] sin dwells in his soul. It dwells in his
[18:33] flesh.
[18:34] Sometimes people read the scripture and
[18:36] try to
[18:37] justify say, "Well, you see what Paul
[18:40] said. So I do things I shouldn't do. I
[18:43] know I shouldn't do it, but I do it in a
[18:44] way. But there's grace." No, you can't
[18:47] twist the scriptures.
[18:49] Can we say amen? He said, "For the will
[18:52] is present with me, but how to perform
[18:55] that which is good I find not. For the
[18:58] good that I would do, I do not, but the
[19:00] evil which I would not that I do. Now if
[19:04] I do that I would not, it is no more
[19:07] that more no more I that do it, but sin
[19:10] that dwelleth in me with this is flesh.
[19:14] I find the law that when I would do
[19:16] good, evil is present with me." Then he
[19:20] said, "For I delight in the law after
[19:22] the inward man." See, he's separating
[19:25] the inward man from the outward man.
[19:27] Amen. Amen. He let know let him know my
[19:30] heart desires to serve the Lord, not to
[19:33] obey the flesh. And he
[19:36] said, "But I see another law in my
[19:38] members, warn against the law of my
[19:41] mind, and bringing me into captivity to
[19:43] the law of sin which is in my members,
[19:46] not soul members." Oh wretched man that
[19:49] I am, who shall deliver me from the body
[19:52] of this death? Amen. You may be seated.
[19:55] May the Lord add a blessing to the
[19:57] reading of his
[19:59] word. Amen. And I want to
[20:07] uh I want to read a quote
[20:16] here.
[20:19] Amen. I was just trying to uh we got in
[20:23] pretty late last night, but we're here
[20:25] by God's grace. Amen.
[20:31] Uh this come from the message of
[20:39] perfection. But B said God being
[20:43] infinite, who cannot lie, cannot speak
[20:46] anything contrary, knows everything,
[20:50] just as perfect at the beginning as he
[20:53] is at the
[20:54] ending. and just as perfect at the end
[20:57] as he was the beginning. He said God is
[21:01] endless like eternity.
[21:05] He said you could never find the corner
[21:06] of a perfect circle. You could run and
[21:09] run through ages and eternity and
[21:13] there'll never never be an end to it.
[21:16] And that's the way God is. And when when
[21:20] and when he be first, he said God always
[21:24] was. He was infinite, perfect to begin
[21:27] with and he'll always be the same. He
[21:30] never can change. He is perfectly the
[21:32] same. Then he began to say, he said,
[21:35] "Now this great chain of perfection was
[21:38] broken by time."
[21:42] I remember
[21:44] uh I used to have a question uh years
[21:48] ago not questioning the message cuz I
[21:51] never that's one thing I never do is
[21:53] question the message. I might have
[21:55] questions, but I don't question the
[21:57] message.
[21:59] Because uh when you start questioning
[22:01] the message, you just open up a big old
[22:03] door of doubt. Even if it's a little,
[22:06] but to the devil, it's a big door. And
[22:10] he'll start working from there. And
[22:12] sometimes people just don't understand
[22:14] how the devil work. If you can get a
[22:16] doubt in your mind today, if you live 10
[22:19] more years, he'll wait 10 more years for
[22:21] he revisit the doubt that he put in your
[22:23] mind today.
[22:24] if it'll just sit there. That's just how
[22:26] the devil operates. Uh the devil got
[22:29] more patience than we do.
[22:33] Just to be honest with you, he actually
[22:35] does. I was reading the story about
[22:37] Abselon and David. And we know Abselon
[22:40] had a plan and his plan was to get the
[22:43] throne. And you remember how uh he
[22:46] tricked Joab? all of the politics and
[22:49] stuff that they was doing, burning
[22:50] Joab's field to get Joab's attention,
[22:53] all of that stuff. But you know, when
[22:55] you read that story, when Abselon began
[22:58] to talk about, oh, if I was the king, I
[23:01] would handle all your matters and I'll
[23:03] make sure I put you top priority. It was
[23:06] very crafty. But if you really look at
[23:09] the whole story, took him 40 years
[23:12] to accomplish that. So look how patient
[23:15] he was. Yeah. 40 years. So that's why I
[23:18] say the devil has a lot of patience.
[23:22] But you know, I had a question one time
[23:24] and when I heard brother Brandham talked
[23:26] about uh Adam and Eve fell from eternal
[23:30] life and a question came not questioning
[23:33] what he said. I said eternal life is no
[23:36] beginning, there's no ending. How could
[23:39] they fall from eternal life? That's not
[23:42] as
[23:42] interesting. That's eternal life. Yeah.
[23:46] I said, I want to understand. But you
[23:48] know, my makeup, I wait for
[23:51] understanding. Amen. I'll just wait.
[23:55] Because I do know one thing. With the
[23:56] right attitude, God going to reveal to
[23:59] me what I need to know when I need to
[24:02] know it. I don't uh because I'm put it
[24:05] to you like
[24:07] this. Like we said in prayer, flesh and
[24:09] blood can't reveal these things to you.
[24:12] Yeah. Don't you know somebody can be
[24:14] talking to you, you got something you
[24:16] want to know, they know the answer and
[24:18] they can be explaining it to you and you
[24:20] just like
[24:23] you know then you they say you you got
[24:26] it. You be like
[24:30] then you walk off still with the
[24:32] question but you trying but then one day
[24:36] just like a light turns on and then you
[24:39] see it plainly that was your time for
[24:42] God to reveal that to you. We can't make
[24:45] it happen but we can just wait upon him
[24:48] right attitude and in prayer and so
[24:51] forth. God will reveal.
[24:54] Amen. So when I began to think about
[24:56] that, I said, "My goodness." Then it
[24:59] just come clear, you know, you just
[25:01] wait. And he he pretty much answered my
[25:03] question in this message, but it was
[25:06] it's I'm not uh wanting to get into my
[25:08] question that it was, but just I want to
[25:10] show something that he said here that's
[25:12] interesting to
[25:14] me. He said he said then I'm sorry. He
[25:18] said now this great chain of perfection
[25:21] was broken by
[25:23] time space. He said time came because of
[25:28] sin. He said let's draw a picture of
[25:30] time. Let's see a perfect circle forever
[25:33] forever. Then all of once sin dropped
[25:37] in. He said put a little as my wife call
[25:39] it a little hickey or a little drop in
[25:43] the chain. So it comes down now. He said
[25:46] eternity continues on but is not in its
[25:50] perfect
[25:52] condition. Here's a little gap comes
[25:54] down break over this way goes out this
[25:57] way. God had to do that because Satan
[26:01] caused it. So what happened when Adam
[26:04] and Eve they failed from eternal life?
[26:07] What the to make the question so simple
[26:09] to me when he explained it they would
[26:11] have never failed. They would have lived
[26:14] eternally if sin never would have came
[26:16] into the picture. So they had eternal
[26:19] life. As long as there was no sin coming
[26:22] into the picture, they would have lived.
[26:24] Amen. Can we say amen? But then he said
[26:27] then time dropped in. So when time
[26:30] dropped in, that's when all of the aging
[26:32] came. Because you remember when sin, and
[26:35] I'll read a quote here in a moment. When
[26:37] sin came into the picture, the prophet
[26:39] even talks about like a big old uh dark
[26:42] uh sheep fell down to the earth and so
[26:44] forth and then everything began to
[26:46] change. Yeah. Amen. Uh but the thing of
[26:49] it is it because of one man. Adam. Sin
[26:54] was able to enter into the world because
[26:56] of one man. Not one woman but one man.
[26:59] But now sin entered into the world
[27:01] through Adam. But God had to come
[27:03] himself to be the second Adam to take us
[27:06] back to the Garden of Eden, take us back
[27:09] to them conditions. So he began to say
[27:12] here, he said, he said God had to do
[27:15] that because Satan caused it and it
[27:17] dropped down to a space of time for
[27:20] trying. Now this is what was
[27:22] interesting. He said for trying and the
[27:25] perfecting and for the purging of the
[27:28] loss. He said that's God by his
[27:30] sovereign grace might someday lift that
[27:34] little hickey or gap back into the
[27:37] perfect circle. Then she rolls on just
[27:39] the same. He said time. Now time is this
[27:43] little loop. It drops down. Jesus was
[27:46] from eternity to eternity. But he
[27:49] stepped in time space and was made
[27:53] flesh. come through here in the order to
[27:56] sanctify or put a streak of blood all
[27:58] across this place to redeem it and
[28:01] connect it back with God again for all
[28:04] eternity. You see that's all time. He
[28:07] said then God when it started here at
[28:10] the end of the little kink in the
[28:12] perfect circle that made it a little
[28:14] kink in it. When God started here he was
[28:18] perfect. Everything he said was perfect.
[28:20] Everything he does is perfect. Amen. It
[28:25] was a spot that I was looking for. I
[28:27] didn't print it out, but I could just
[28:29] kind of quote it. But what brother
[28:31] Brandon made a statement in the message
[28:32] perfection. He said that we are actually
[28:35] living in time preparing for eternity.
[28:40] He said living in time preparing for
[28:44] eternity. So, amen. So, uh, uh, I really
[28:48] I can use that for a title, but to be
[28:50] honest with you, I don't have a title,
[28:52] but we'll use that for a title because
[28:54] it is kind of blend in with, uh, what we
[28:57] have on our heart. And I'll be honest
[28:59] with you this morning, I have a lot of
[29:01] things on my heart.
[29:03] Uh just lately even at my at the church
[29:06] we been dealing with a lot of things and
[29:09] just kind of laid back and just dealing
[29:11] with stuff because I began to observe
[29:14] see so many things going on and and we
[29:17] just tried to work with the church but
[29:20] something happened to me back in
[29:22] December. Uh I was I was overseas. God
[29:26] just put it in my heart and and say stay
[29:28] home. So I don't really go nowhere. only
[29:31] when I came cuz Chad called and I and I
[29:35] didn't feel led not to come so I came
[29:39] but I'm content I'm very happy being
[29:43] home I really like being home now I do
[29:46] so I don't go I really don't really have
[29:49] a desire to go really nowhere because
[29:51] something has happened in my own church
[29:54] and I'm working with it and I see now
[29:56] why God told me in December kind of stay
[29:59] home and that's what I do. And uh what
[30:02] I've been doing is working with the
[30:03] young people in the church and uh and
[30:07] I've been enjoying it because the way I
[30:09] looked at it, you don't preach all
[30:11] around here, youth camps and this is
[30:14] what about the young people in your own
[30:16] church. I was assuming just because I'm
[30:19] preaching, they getting it. I was
[30:21] assuming and I said, "No, I need to work
[30:24] with them." So that's what I do. We try
[30:26] to take one month out of one week out
[30:30] weekend out of the month and I sit down
[30:31] and talk to them. And I'm going to be
[30:32] honest with you. I go over them with
[30:35] marriage and divorce. Godraise God. I
[30:39] deal with marriage and divorce,
[30:41] courtship, dating. I deal with the whole
[30:44] nine yard. That's what I do. Cuz I'm
[30:47] instilling I'm instilling in their
[30:49] heart.
[30:51] I'm getting old. I'm not always going to
[30:54] be here. If there is a tomorrow, I said,
[30:57] you're it.
[30:59] I said, you're the one when the elders
[31:02] die off. Whatever we leave here, that's
[31:05] what's going to happen in the church. I
[31:07] said, but if you are rock solid on the
[31:10] message of this hour,
[31:12] Amen. When I leave, everything that's
[31:15] been planted here, every seed that's
[31:17] been planted here, that's what will
[31:19] stay. Amen. And that seed has to be the
[31:21] word. I can't plant me into them. No.
[31:24] Amen. Because if I plant them into me,
[31:27] them me into them, when I die, guess
[31:29] what? They'll die.
[31:32] They'll die. But if I can get them to a
[31:35] new birth, and they got a clear
[31:37] understanding of this message. If I die,
[31:40] they still go on because now they have a
[31:43] relationship with God. And I said, you
[31:45] know, I don't know who's going to be a
[31:47] minister in this church and or what's
[31:49] going on. I don't know what God is going
[31:50] to do. I said, "But I do know if you are
[31:52] solid on this message with a new birth,
[31:56] this church will continue on just as it
[31:58] was when I was here." See, that's what's
[32:01] important. Amen. Is that right? That's
[32:03] why many when brother Brandham passed
[32:05] away, many failed. Because brother
[32:08] Brandham, they worshiped brother
[32:10] Brandham. They failed. They didn't catch
[32:12] what the message was, what he was doing.
[32:15] What is to me the message is Christ in
[32:18] you, the hope of glory. Yeah, that's
[32:21] what the message is to me. Praise the
[32:23] Lord. So, I don't get into egos. I don't
[32:26] get into uh comparisons. I I don't get
[32:30] into that kind of stuff cuz it's it's a
[32:32] shame you got ministers now not really
[32:35] preaching the gospel. They're preaching
[32:37] ego.
[32:39] They're preaching their personal
[32:40] complexes, their personal battles they
[32:43] got with another preaching stuff like
[32:44] this. We We don't need that.
[32:48] Praise the Lord. We we don't need that.
[32:50] And I don't bring that to my church and
[32:52] talking about my disagreement with this
[32:54] brother. No, I don't I don't do that.
[32:56] But I will stand on against a spirit cuz
[33:00] sometime there's certain spirit that
[33:01] float around. You have to just deal with
[33:04] them and prepare the church. If this
[33:05] comes up, this is where I'm showing you
[33:08] where it come from. Not trying to call a
[33:10] name or individual, but a spirit cuz
[33:13] that's my job to do that. Amen. But we
[33:17] but when he made the statement we are
[33:20] living in time preparing for
[33:23] eternity. So actually while you are
[33:27] living right now this is time
[33:32] for the purpose to prepare you for
[33:35] eternity. Amen. This message did not
[33:38] prepare us to stay here.
[33:41] It prepares us to leave, but it also
[33:44] prepares us how to deal with things
[33:47] while we're here. Amen. Because this
[33:50] world is not our home. Amen. So long as
[33:54] you got breath in your life, you have an
[33:57] opportunity to prepare for eternity.
[34:00] That's what it's all about. Yeah. Soon
[34:03] as sin fell into the earth, fell into
[34:05] the world, God great plan of redemption.
[34:08] Amen. which already had started in the
[34:10] back part of the line, but now it's
[34:12] being manifested on earth. Well, man now
[34:15] is preparing to meet that God again. Can
[34:19] we say amen? That's why in Genesis, it
[34:21] started with worship with Adam, I mean
[34:24] with Cain and Abel. It started with
[34:26] worship. Each one of them had it in them
[34:28] to worship, right? But God showed a
[34:31] pattern right there in Genesis that how
[34:35] a Abel the scripture explains how Abel's
[34:37] sacrifice was respected and Cain wasn't.
[34:41] But look how grateful God was. He taught
[34:43] Cain if you do what your brother do
[34:46] you'll do well. Amen. But if you don't
[34:49] death lies, sin lies at the door. God
[34:52] laid a whole pattern right there in
[34:55] Genesis because everything starts in
[34:57] Genesis. Amen. See uh I I love the
[34:59] message how brother Brandham just
[35:01] explains certain things and it just
[35:03] becomes eyeopeners to me. Amen. You know
[35:07] sometimes uh you know people be people
[35:10] want to put you in categories. We
[35:12] shouldn't put one another in categories.
[35:14] Ministers shouldn't put that minister in
[35:16] a category. We shouldn't do things like
[35:18] that. We are to respect one another for
[35:21] exactly what we are.
[35:24] And it saddens my heart when ministers
[35:26] do that. Some put categories. You don't
[35:28] read enough quote. You read too much
[35:30] scriptures and and then now you read too
[35:32] much scriptures and where's the quotes
[35:34] and it's that's nonsense.
[35:38] Can we say praise the Lord? I have
[35:40] preached services myself. It just out of
[35:43] one quote because that one quote brother
[35:46] Brown said so many things in one quote
[35:48] to the Bible just open up even more and
[35:50] I start running through the scriptures
[35:53] and that one quote just stay right there
[35:55] with everything. There's nothing wrong
[35:57] with that.
[35:59] Can we say praise the Lord? There's
[36:00] nothing wrong with that. Amen. And some
[36:03] talking about I don't have you don't
[36:05] have a right. I ain't not me but some
[36:07] mentality of people you don't have a
[36:10] right to read a scripture refer to it.
[36:11] Brother Brandham didn't refer to it. I
[36:14] said Lord have mercy. What is your
[36:15] understanding of the opening of the
[36:17] word?
[36:19] The Bible whole Bible is open. Can we
[36:22] say amen? The whole Bible is open and I
[36:26] thank God. I don't care if you find say
[36:28] we found a tape that brother Brandon
[36:30] that haven't been published yet and we
[36:32] don't found it now we going to bring it
[36:33] out. I said it make no different what
[36:34] the tape is. It ain't going to go
[36:36] against the ones already have.
[36:39] Can we say amen? Ain't nothing new is
[36:41] coming but what it is you and I as a
[36:44] personal individual God is opening your
[36:47] eyes up more giving you revelation. So I
[36:50] just thank God for those things and and
[36:52] and just uh I appreciate what God is
[36:55] doing when I when when I hear like
[36:57] brother Chad in Poland, it was a young
[37:00] brother I was trying to get him to come
[37:01] preach for me Wednesday. I really like
[37:03] him. Brother Solomon Huffman, I called
[37:05] him and I and you know you've been
[37:07] around a while when you call somebody on
[37:10] the phone if it's a different ringtone,
[37:12] you know they
[37:14] overseas. You say, "Yep, he overseas."
[37:18] That's your phone rang different. And
[37:20] and the brother said, "Brother Burley,"
[37:22] I said, "Hey, could you come by
[37:23] Wednesday?" He said, "Brother, I'm in
[37:24] Honduras." And just him saying that when
[37:27] I got off the phone, I was just like,
[37:30] "God be praised." How this brethren out
[37:34] there in that field laboring. See, you
[37:37] come to church Sunday, you say, "Well,
[37:39] we in church," but somebody's laboring.
[37:41] Yeah. Somebody's traveling. Somebody's
[37:44] overseas. Somebody risking their lives.
[37:46] Somebody is doing something for this
[37:48] gospel. Amen. And I think how the
[37:51] prophet balanced everything out. If you
[37:53] can't go, send somebody. That makes you
[37:56] just as much as a part of that work. I
[37:58] thank God for that. And I said, boy, it
[38:01] just I just appreciate ministers with
[38:03] just a burden not to preach themselves,
[38:06] but with a burden to go out there and
[38:08] try to grab souls, cuz God, this is
[38:10] God's work. It's not the work of man.
[38:14] Amen. But we're actually living in time
[38:18] just for one reason is to prepare for
[38:22] eternity. Amen. Amen. So, let me just
[38:32] uh I got some things. I was just jotting
[38:34] them down and looking at some things
[38:37] and I could just share with you is in my
[38:40] heart. Amen.
[38:43] I want to go to questions and answers to
[38:45] deal with the scripture that we read in
[38:46] Romans
[38:48] 7. Brother Brandon began to uh read that
[38:52] scripture and he began to refer to it.
[38:54] This is question answer
[38:56] 1964. He
[38:58] says he said they wrote out the
[39:00] scripture that Paul is speaking to the
[39:02] Romans. He said let me kind of polish it
[39:05] up so you can see. I like the way he put
[39:07] it cuz just reading Romans 7 your mind
[39:10] is
[39:11] like man he won't and he will what you
[39:16] know just be honest but he said let me
[39:20] polish it up not change it but let me
[39:23] polish it up so you can
[39:26] understand no so you can see which is
[39:29] the same thing he said in me is two
[39:33] persons amen not two souls
[39:38] two persons. Amen. He said he
[39:42] said one wants to do wrong, the other
[39:46] wants me to do what the then he said the
[39:49] other wants me to do and every time I
[39:51] start to do right then the wrong hinders
[39:54] me. He said, "How many of you people on
[39:56] the interviews this afternoon has run
[39:58] that same thing and this morning?" See,
[40:01] same thing. I spoke on it this morning
[40:06] temporarily. He said, "You are an
[40:08] outward man which is controlled by six
[40:12] senses.
[40:14] You are an inward man controlled by one
[40:17] sense which is faith." Amen. which we
[40:21] also know in different messages he
[40:23] taught in your soul is either faith or
[40:26] doubt. Faith is going to control you or
[40:28] doubt is going to control you. But he
[40:31] just said here a few words and I was
[40:33] sharing this with the church Wednesday.
[40:36] He just when he just said this free word
[40:38] right here, my mind just like wow I knew
[40:41] this but this this is good. He says
[40:44] right
[40:45] here, he said, "And this faith
[40:50] disagrees with all six senses if the six
[40:54] senses doesn't agree with faith."
[40:57] I said, "M, that's very powerful to me."
[41:00] So, I preached a message, faith
[41:02] disagrees.
[41:04] Faith would disagree with any sense if
[41:07] that sense disagrees with the word.
[41:10] Amen.
[41:12] That sounds so simple, but that's
[41:13] powerful. That actually teaches me even
[41:17] more. Whenever my senses, we know these
[41:20] things. Whenever I start thinking wrong
[41:22] or my reasoning, trying to start
[41:24] reasoning, my faith rise up. What do my
[41:26] faith takes me back to is the word.
[41:30] That's what it's going to take me to the
[41:31] word. The reason say this is okay. But
[41:34] the word say this is wrong. Then I just
[41:36] kill reason and I stay with what faith
[41:38] says in the word. Amen. He said now as
[41:42] long as these six senses agree with
[41:44] faith, wonderful. But when the six sense
[41:47] disagree with faith, then leave the six
[41:50] senses alone. That is so simple
[41:54] but yet so hard for people to do. And
[41:58] the reason why people feed the black dog
[42:03] Yeah. more than they will the white dog.
[42:06] Amen. You remember he asked the chief,
[42:08] he said, "How chief doing? Chief good,
[42:10] chief bad." He said, "How could that
[42:12] be?" He said, "There's two dogs in me
[42:14] and they're fighting against each
[42:16] other." He said, "One of them whack, one
[42:18] of them white, I'm sorry. One of them
[42:20] white, one of them black." Then he asked
[42:21] the question, who wins? He said, "It
[42:24] depends on not who my wife feed the most
[42:27] or my husband feed the most. It depends
[42:29] on who I feed the most. That's who wins.
[42:34] See, uh I've been dealing with uh I
[42:38] don't know why. Well, God just been
[42:40] dealing with my heart with reasoning.
[42:43] It's a It's I began to when you talk to
[42:46] people, it's more interesting to me
[42:50] reasoning. How people actually be
[42:52] reasoning against the word and don't
[42:55] even see it. Yeah. And you can see you
[42:57] be like, "Really?
[43:00] This is simple, but why? Why? Why you
[43:03] letting your mind run like that? But
[43:05] then I just go right back to the word. I
[43:07] said, because they ain't got faith in
[43:08] the word.
[43:11] Faith in the word, it kills reasoning.
[43:14] But reasoning is so powerful. Yeah.
[43:18] Within itself. People think it's
[43:20] something to play with, but it's not.
[43:23] So, let's talk about this for a moment.
[43:24] You don't mind? Amen. Amen.
[43:33] I
[43:35] believe if I can find the
[43:48] quote, y'all bear with me. I'm not fast
[43:50] as I used to
[43:53] be. I thank God um I could actually see
[43:57] better. I thank God for that. It's been
[44:00] uh painful,
[44:02] but I can see it a little bit better.
[44:07] In the message conflict between God and
[44:12] Satan, he said God can't give nothing
[44:15] else but his word. Amen. Because that's
[44:18] what he chose first.
[44:21] When God makes a decision, he has to
[44:24] ever remain that way.
[44:28] He said, "Satan took reasoning and took
[44:31] the reasoning and attacked the word and
[44:34] shook Eve off the path." That's right.
[44:37] By reasoning, human reasoning. He's now
[44:42] the only way that
[44:43] he she could have gotten to disbelieve
[44:46] God's word, it had to be appealing.
[44:50] See, we're living in this age of
[44:52] something appealing.
[44:55] Are you with me? reasoning is very
[44:58] appealing.
[44:59] Now, he had to get E with appealing. He
[45:02] said, "And Satan knows how to make
[45:06] reasoning appealing." He said, "Satan
[45:09] knows how to do it." That's right. It
[45:12] has to appeal to you. And sin is very
[45:16] appealing. There's only one sin that's
[45:19] unbelief. So, it's really appealing.
[45:22] Satan makes sin so appealing to you.
[45:27] Amen. Now, he says here,
[45:31] uh, take on the whole armor of God.
[45:34] Satan tried to get into to spy out to
[45:37] see what how he could get a hold of that
[45:39] human race. He took one of the most
[45:42] famous tactics. It showed that he had to
[45:45] be a supernatural power to think it. He
[45:48] used this the first time and was
[45:50] successful. He's done it ever since.
[45:53] Still successful to a certain
[45:57] estate. He uses reasoning against faith.
[46:01] I'm I'm happy he put that spot. He's c
[46:04] he's successful to a certain estate.
[46:07] Because there are some some people they
[46:09] know how to cast down reasoning. Amen.
[46:12] Are you with me? So he began to deal
[46:15] with this situation on reasoning. Satan
[46:18] came to Eve and began to reason against
[46:21] the word of God. The great armor that
[46:23] God had fortified his people with. He
[46:26] began to use reasoning. See, it's only
[46:31] reasonable that God would not destroy
[46:34] you. Surely you will not die. But
[46:37] remember, friend, that Satan tactic to
[46:39] begin with. He still uses the same thing
[46:42] and still successful with it. Reasoning.
[46:45] Amen. I'm seeing that spirit. I don't
[46:48] know what going on up here, whatever,
[46:50] but I'm seeing that spirit more powerful
[46:53] now happening in people lives than
[46:56] anything.
[46:58] It's reasoning cuz that's what started
[47:00] the fall. So, look what's happening now.
[47:04] Reasoning. I'm going to go into some
[47:06] reasoning things in a moment if the Lord
[47:08] would help us.
[47:17] The Bible tells
[47:18] us, I want to turn to a few scriptures
[47:21] here and we'll get to my message that
[47:23] we're trying to get
[47:27] to. I want to go to Genesis
[47:39] 1. I preach out of Genesis a lot.
[47:43] Cuz I know if I can catch the
[47:48] beginning, the book of Revelation shows
[47:50] the end. Everything in between show how
[47:53] all of it just comes up to the end.
[47:56] Amen.
[47:58] When I always look at Genesis chapter 1,
[48:01] I preach on this a lot. It's the birth
[48:04] of the earth. And I also look at that
[48:07] the birth of you and me. Amen. Cuz when
[48:10] God created the earth, he had you and me
[48:12] in mind.
[48:14] God laid everything right in Genesis. He
[48:17] laid adoption, the church ages, the
[48:20] seals, all of these is laying right here
[48:23] in the book of Genesis.
[48:25] Amen. When I see the earth, when God
[48:29] created the
[48:31] earth, it begin to talks about the
[48:33] firmament, the stars and the moon, all
[48:36] these things is there because the earth
[48:39] is not a self- sustaining system.
[48:42] The earth cannot sustain by itself.
[48:46] If he just was just the earth without
[48:49] the solar system, without Mars, without
[48:51] Jupiter, without the sun, without the
[48:53] stars, the earth is can't make it by
[48:55] itself. Amen. And when I seen that, I
[48:58] realized I can't make it by myself.
[49:00] Amen. I am not a self- sustaining
[49:03] system. I need my brothers. I need my
[49:06] sisters. Amen. The earth need the sun.
[49:08] Yeah. Cuz if it didn't have the sun, it
[49:11] would just be a ball of ice. Yeah. Amen.
[49:14] The earth needs the moon. Cuz if it
[49:16] wasn't for the moon, the earth would
[49:18] continually flood. Is that right? The
[49:21] earth need the stars at night time to
[49:23] give light. It It's not self- sustaining
[49:26] within itself. It needs other things
[49:28] from outwardly. That's why the scripture
[49:30] when it speaks, we'll read it in a
[49:32] moment. He created the sun, the moon,
[49:34] and the star to do what? The scripture
[49:36] said to give light on the earth. Amen.
[49:40] So everything has a purpose. That's why
[49:43] you and I, we're not self-sustaining.
[49:45] Amen. But with God in your soul, yeah.
[49:48] Can we say amen? He's the keeper. He's
[49:51] the keeper of your soul. But yet, we
[49:53] still need one another. Amen. I can't do
[49:56] without you and you can't do without me.
[49:58] If you are the bride of Jesus Christ.
[50:00] Amen. Is that right? So, we we when in
[50:06] Genesis one, I want to go here.
[50:19] Let me go to verse
[50:25] 14. God said, "Let there be lights in
[50:27] the firmament of the
[50:29] heaven to divide the day from the night.
[50:33] Let them be for signs and for seasons
[50:36] and for days and years.
[50:40] He's explaining everything what the
[50:41] purpose for everything is. Yeah. He
[50:45] said, "Let them be for lights in the
[50:46] firmament of the heaven to give light
[50:48] upon the earth." And it was so. God made
[50:52] two great lights, a greater light to
[50:54] rule the day, a lesser light to rule the
[50:57] night. He made the stars also. God set
[51:01] them in the firmament of the heaven to
[51:03] give light upon the earth. He says it
[51:06] twice here. And then he said to rule
[51:09] over the day, rule over the night and to
[51:12] divide the light from the darkness. And
[51:14] God saw that it was
[51:17] good. I asked the church, I said, uh,
[51:20] when you read that, what do you
[51:22] see? I said, looking at it cornerally,
[51:25] you just see sun, stars, and moons and
[51:28] earth. Yeah. I said that's and I said
[51:30] that's not incorrect. If you're a
[51:32] scientist read that he going to start
[51:34] breaking it down to you. The solar
[51:36] systems and the cosmic light. That's
[51:38] what he going to start doing.
[51:41] I said but when I look at it myself
[51:44] because how God don't open up everything
[51:45] to us. I said I see Christ. I see br the
[51:49] bride and I said I see the messengers.
[51:52] Amen. I said and I see me. Amen. I said
[51:56] that's what I see when I read this
[51:58] scripture. I said but in this scripture
[52:01] we we we when we see it it it places us
[52:04] to tell us exactly who we are. We know
[52:08] the sun we are type the moon. And we
[52:11] know the moon reflects no light of his
[52:14] own. It can only reflect the light of
[52:16] the sun. I said so I see Christ in here
[52:20] and I see the bride. I said because we
[52:22] have no light of our own. Yeah. I said,
[52:25] "But the scripture tells us these are
[52:27] for time, signs, and seasons." I said,
[52:29] "It's laying right here." I said, "But
[52:32] what is the purpose for all of these
[52:33] things is to give light on the earth." I
[52:36] said, "So we here as the bride of Jesus
[52:39] Christ, what is our purpose to be here
[52:40] for? It's to give light, not darkness.
[52:44] It is to give light." That's what our
[52:46] purpose is for. We're living in a dark
[52:48] world, but God got us here. Jesus said,
[52:50] "You are the light of the world." Now,
[52:52] he was the light. He said, "But now you
[52:54] are the light because this he the sun
[52:56] now don't transfer the light to the
[52:57] moon." Amen. I said, "This is what I
[52:59] see." And I said, "Notice the thing that
[53:02] I love." He God made two great lights.
[53:05] The greater light to rule the day and
[53:07] the lesser light to rule the night. He
[53:10] made the stars also. He said the lesser
[53:12] light which is the moon to rule the
[53:15] night. I said that telling me my place
[53:18] and my position is here to rule. Amen.
[53:21] Not the night rule me, but me rule the
[53:23] night. I said this is what the Bible is
[53:26] telling me. And we don't rule that
[53:28] within ourselves. Can we say praise the
[53:31] Lord? So we look at things differently.
[53:34] That's why I don't believe the bride of
[53:36] Jesus Christ is failure. I believe in
[53:38] the power of God. I really believe it
[53:41] with all of my heart. All the things
[53:43] that can happen in this world, I look at
[53:45] God positioning Yeah. his people. Amen.
[53:50] Are you with me? We move. We shift. I
[53:53] don't look I don't look at thing
[53:54] negatively. I wait and I watch how God
[53:57] is shifting things. It it it stir my
[54:00] heart up that even some people that done
[54:02] left the message coming back. Praise
[54:04] God. It stirs my heart. But those are
[54:08] the one never said the message was
[54:11] wrong. Yeah. Right. They just said, "I
[54:13] can't live it." Right. But I know it's
[54:15] right. Yeah. But now they coming back.
[54:18] Amen. because they realizing ain't
[54:20] nothing out there. I had an individual
[54:22] call me yesterday said, "Brother Burley,
[54:24] I done everything I could to try to go
[54:27] to
[54:28] denomination just to try to get
[54:29] something." Said, "I remember what
[54:31] Brother Brandham said and you can get a
[54:33] little piece of throw out the seed out
[54:35] just something." She said, "But I can't
[54:37] take it no more." She said, "I know."
[54:39] She pretty much I know I supposed to be.
[54:41] I said, "Well, you was just a chicken.
[54:43] You was just a eagle in the chicken
[54:44] coop." I said, "You knew that, but now
[54:46] you done experienced it." Yeah, that's
[54:48] right. Now it's time to come back home.
[54:50] Amen. Never dis call the prophet false,
[54:54] nothing like that. But realize I can't
[54:56] live this. I got more respect for people
[54:59] like that. Amen. Because I know it's
[55:01] hope that they can come back. And I just
[55:04] leave it alone. It'll be their time and
[55:06] season. God ain't going to lose none.
[55:09] And then you'll get some come back
[55:11] within matter of months. It seem like
[55:14] their faith is stronger than one that's
[55:16] been sitting around. Yeah, that's right.
[55:18] Are you with me? And then the one
[55:19] sitting around, they don't pop back up
[55:21] in church and trying to be all spiritual
[55:23] now. Oh, look at them. I said, "Look
[55:24] out, prodical son, older brother."
[55:28] Amen. Hello. He had that same attitude.
[55:32] You never done nothing fat for me. You
[55:34] ain't done that for me. None of that.
[55:35] That's a bad attitude. I'm just thankful
[55:38] that they coming back.
[55:40] Can we say amen? I don't debate with the
[55:43] ones that don't believe it. Yeah. I
[55:45] don't know why some of us think that you
[55:46] yourself can change an unbeliever.
[55:49] Right? So I don't debate with it. I let
[55:51] it go. When they say I don't believe, I
[55:53] say, thank you. You save me a lot of
[55:55] time wondering, do you believe or not?
[55:57] Let me go put my energy somewhere else.
[55:59] I'm not going to go an hour an hour
[56:01] after you just told me you don't
[56:02] believe. Right. I want to talk to
[56:04] somebody that want to believe. I want to
[56:07] talk to somebody that's thirsty for God.
[56:09] Amen. Want to move up higher higher
[56:12] depths with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[56:13] That's who I want to talk to. Not
[56:15] religious games. That's right.
[56:19] Amen. Y'all don't mind I just talk to
[56:21] you a little bit. Draise.
[56:25] This is serious. Yeah.
[56:29] Three weeks ago, I preached a
[56:36] funeral. Good. Many people
[56:39] there. I already knew what was going to
[56:41] happen. woman preacher sit beside me. I
[56:44] didn't get up there and say, "Oh, you
[56:46] woman preacher." No, I let them do their
[56:47] thing cuz it's I'm just come pay respect
[56:51] for one of the members in the church
[56:53] love one. But I tell you one thing about
[56:57] funerals, I always try to have an alter
[56:59] call.
[57:02] Always. I try to have an altar
[57:05] call. So when I come in there and sit
[57:09] down, they singing a song, making the
[57:12] comments and then the woman preacher
[57:14] gets up and she uh member of the
[57:17] relatives of the relatives and pray. She
[57:21] starts
[57:22] praying, start praying one of them
[57:24] prayers, try to make people go uh jump
[57:29] or
[57:29] whatever. I just had my head bowed. I
[57:32] said, "Lord," I said, "This woman is so
[57:34] messed up. She even praying a lot
[57:38] cuz the stuff she was saying in the
[57:39] prayer was unscriptural. Yeah. But I
[57:41] said, "I ain't worried about that. I'm
[57:43] here for another reason." Yeah. After
[57:45] she finished and I come to the pool
[57:49] pit, I knew they was going to read that
[57:51] scripture. Let not thy heart be
[57:53] troubled. Believe in God. Believe also
[57:55] in me. He said, "I'll go prepare a place
[57:57] for you." I knew they was going to read
[57:59] that. So they did.
[58:03] I just come to the pool pit
[58:05] and I said, 'You know, I said, I have to
[58:08] be
[58:10] honest. I said, is there's anybody in
[58:14] here, you know, you're wrong, but you
[58:17] want to serve God? I said, I'm talking
[58:20] to
[58:21] you. I said, now the rest of you going
[58:24] to get mad at me. I said, I'm going to
[58:27] explain why. I said, ' Can you tell me
[58:30] who in the Bible got mad at Jesus? I
[58:32] said, ' Was it the woman in the whale at
[58:33] the whale? Was it the woman caught in
[58:36] adultery? So, neither one or none of
[58:38] them got mad at Jesus.
[58:41] I said, "Who got mad at Jesus?" Some of
[58:42] them, some people responded. They said,
[58:44] "Parisee, Sadduceed." I said, "Thank
[58:46] you." And I said, "I just I want to let
[58:49] you know if you get mad at me, that's
[58:52] what you
[58:53] are. That's just who that's just what
[58:55] you are." I said, "What? You are a
[58:58] religious hypocrite." And I said, "You
[59:00] are the one going to get mad at me." I
[59:03] said, "But if you hungry and you're
[59:05] thirsting for God," I said, "I can talk
[59:08] to you, and this is what I come for."
[59:11] That's what I told him. I said,
[59:13] "Now," I said, "In the scripture, what
[59:15] they just read, I said, I want to read
[59:18] it again." I said, "Jesus said, I go
[59:21] prepare a place for you that where I am,
[59:24] that you'll be there also." Amen.
[59:26] I said, "Where is that
[59:30] place?" I said, "Can you tell me where
[59:32] that place is that he's talking about?"
[59:34] I said, "Let's read the place that he's
[59:36] talking about." I said, "It's over here
[59:38] in the book of Revelation, New
[59:40] Jerusalem, prepared, adorned as a bride
[59:44] for his, you know, the scripture." Amen.
[59:46] I said, "That's the place he went to go
[59:48] prepare." Amen. Yeah. I said, "But
[59:51] what's interesting to me, he tells me
[59:54] who's going to be in that place and
[59:56] who's not going to be in that place."
[59:57] Yeah, that's right. Like, I said, "Right
[1:00:00] here." He said, "The filthful, the
[1:00:04] unbeliever, all liars." I said, "Look at
[1:00:07] somebody say all liars." They said, "All
[1:00:10] liars, fornicators." I said, "He said
[1:00:13] they ain't going to be in that place." M
[1:00:16] and so if you're doing that right now,
[1:00:19] you need any of that in your life as I'm
[1:00:22] here to tell you presently that place is
[1:00:24] not for you.
[1:00:26] You're not going.
[1:00:28] I said and Jesus was talking in the book
[1:00:30] of John when he said, "I go prepare that
[1:00:33] place for you." I said, "Who is he
[1:00:35] talking
[1:00:35] to?" I said, "Judas's chariot wasn't
[1:00:38] there. He was talking to the disciples,
[1:00:41] but he didn't make that promise to
[1:00:42] Judas." Yeah. Right. I said he couldn't
[1:00:45] have. Yeah. I said, "But Judas had a
[1:00:47] place prepared for him, but it ain't the
[1:00:49] one that Jesus was talking about for the
[1:00:51] believers." Yeah. Right. I said his
[1:00:54] disciples was present with him. I said,
[1:00:56] "Young people, I'm not young people." I
[1:00:58] said, "People, if you're not a disciple
[1:01:00] of the Lord Jesus Christ, as I'm
[1:01:02] speaking to you right now, I said in
[1:01:04] John 14, he wasn't talking to you."
[1:01:08] True. He was talking to disciples. I'm
[1:01:10] going to prepare that place for you.
[1:01:15] Now they getting a
[1:01:17] little got their attention.
[1:01:22] I said if you are a temple, you a house.
[1:01:26] You a vessel. Yeah. I just preached a
[1:01:29] message. A house for a house. That's
[1:01:32] what I
[1:01:33] preached. I said Jesus going to prepare
[1:01:35] a temple, house, tabernacle, however you
[1:01:38] want to put it. You say you want to go
[1:01:40] there. I said, but Jesus needs a house
[1:01:43] right now. Amen. Right. I said he want a
[1:01:46] house right now. So he'll give you a
[1:01:48] house. Yeah. Right.
[1:01:51] Praise the Lord. Amen. Cuz he want to
[1:01:53] live in you. He want to dwell in you. I
[1:01:55] said he says he said that me and my
[1:01:58] father will come and make our abode in
[1:02:00] you. Yeah. I said that means a permanent
[1:02:02] residence.
[1:02:04] I said but he need a house now before he
[1:02:06] can take you to that house. Amen. And so
[1:02:09] I'm talking to houses. Yeah. Amen. Then
[1:02:13] I asked the question. I said, "How many
[1:02:15] of you got a house?"
[1:02:17] They raised their
[1:02:19] hand. I said, "Do you rent it or do you
[1:02:22] buy
[1:02:24] it?" I say,
[1:02:27] "Difference." And I was being very, very
[1:02:29] sincere.
[1:02:31] See, they were wanting me to come
[1:02:32] straight at and just attack. No, I use
[1:02:35] parables. Amen. so they can pick up
[1:02:37] something natural so they could see.
[1:02:40] Amen. I said, "Explain to me why you're
[1:02:43] renting that house. You don't remodel
[1:02:46] it." Yeah. Right. But if you want to do
[1:02:50] a little something, I said, "You'll put
[1:02:52] some cheap paint in it."
[1:02:55] Yeah. Yeah. When you rent a house and
[1:02:58] you're going to want to paint a wall,
[1:02:59] you're not going to get no bear.
[1:03:02] You ain't going to get no Sharon
[1:03:03] Williams whims, right? Yes. You going to
[1:03:05] find the cheapest paint you can get and
[1:03:07] just long as it can look different.
[1:03:09] Right. Right. I said, "But why is it
[1:03:12] when you when you own the
[1:03:14] house, when you want to do something to
[1:03:16] it, why do you get the best?"
[1:03:20] Because it's yours. Yeah. I said, "It's
[1:03:22] yours. You want to put the best in it."
[1:03:24] Yes, sir. I said, now Jesus want you to
[1:03:27] be his house. Yeah. And if that be the
[1:03:30] case, he want to put the best in it.
[1:03:32] Amen. And I said the best that he want
[1:03:34] to put in is himself.
[1:03:38] Amen. I said
[1:03:40] friends, you don't want to be rental
[1:03:43] property. Amen. Yeah. I said Paul said
[1:03:47] we was bought with a price. Amen. I said
[1:03:51] we we've been bought with the price.
[1:03:53] Jesus want to put the best in it. You
[1:03:55] don't want to be rental property.
[1:03:58] You know what rental property is?
[1:04:02] I'm not trying to be funny. I said, "You
[1:04:04] can sing, make people
[1:04:07] cry. You can speak in tongues. You can
[1:04:09] do all those miracles. You can do all of
[1:04:12] that." I said, "But if he ain't living
[1:04:14] in that house, you just rental
[1:04:17] property." Yeah. He used you for a
[1:04:20] season.
[1:04:23] So, Dayton and Kora was rental
[1:04:25] property. K. Ephesus was rental
[1:04:28] property. Right. Judas was rental
[1:04:30] property. Yeah. That's what Paul, Peter,
[1:04:34] James, John bought property cuz he
[1:04:37] resided in them. Amen. Amen. Yes. He
[1:04:41] only used the gifts of the others, but
[1:04:44] he didn't tabernacle inside of them.
[1:04:46] Even Caesar is the devil used him to
[1:04:48] prophesy.
[1:04:50] But God wasn't living in him. Right? I
[1:04:52] said, "You don't want to be that type of
[1:04:54] rental property where God can just use
[1:04:55] your voice to sing, but God could just
[1:04:57] use you to play and bless other people
[1:04:59] and then yet he's not inside of you." I
[1:05:02] said, "That you don't want to do that.
[1:05:03] That's just rental property."
[1:05:05] That's what happened when they said,
[1:05:06] "Lord, did not we prophesy? Lord, did
[1:05:08] not we do this?" Jesus never denied
[1:05:10] nothing. Yeah, you did it. He said, "But
[1:05:13] depart from me. I didn't know you. I
[1:05:15] didn't have a relationship with you. I
[1:05:16] wasn't living in you." I said you don't
[1:05:18] want to be that
[1:05:20] but you want to be the one where God
[1:05:22] could come and dwell in this house. You
[1:05:25] be used of him tabernacle inside of you.
[1:05:28] That's a desperate.
[1:05:31] Amen.
[1:05:33] Hallelujah. And you know what? That
[1:05:36] touched a lot of people. Praise God. It
[1:05:38] touched them because they realized, hey,
[1:05:42] this me this word is real.
[1:05:45] I think that done fallen even around the
[1:05:47] message. People just don't come to an
[1:05:49] organizational life.
[1:05:51] Come to church, sing, shake hands, see
[1:05:54] us Wednesday, see you Sunday, that's it.
[1:05:57] No, God want to be in your life every
[1:05:59] day.
[1:06:01] God want to be speaking to you every
[1:06:02] day, not just in church. And you just
[1:06:05] got a desire every day, thirsting and
[1:06:08] hungry for heavenly things and the
[1:06:10] rapture. Amen. I can't think of nothing
[1:06:12] else. I just want to get out of here.
[1:06:14] Yes. Amen. Are you with me?
[1:06:18] That wasn't in the notes, but anyway,
[1:06:19] God, I'm just being honest with you.
[1:06:23] This message is power.
[1:06:26] Can we say amen? We are not a defeated
[1:06:28] people. We should be able to face
[1:06:30] anything. Any situation, any spirit. Not
[1:06:34] afraid of it. That's the way I feel. I'm
[1:06:36] not afraid of nothing. There's no fear.
[1:06:40] Amen. Because I know whom I believe.
[1:06:43] I'm not ashamed of this gospel. Amen.
[1:06:48] So, we see things. I'm getting to my
[1:06:50] message.
[1:06:54] Bless the Lord.
[1:06:58] I'm just thankful.
[1:07:01] I was presenting to them
[1:07:04] Christ just then. I asked
[1:07:07] him, "Anybody need prayer?"
[1:07:11] And I found out later on somebody was in
[1:07:13] the back. Come on, man. Prayer, prayer,
[1:07:16] prayer, man. Come on. I said, "Wow,
[1:07:20] people hearts are so cold now."
[1:07:24] Let me explain something to
[1:07:26] you.
[1:07:28] Satan. When brother Bley talk about the
[1:07:30] greatest battle ever fought, he talk
[1:07:33] about Satan's ambition.
[1:07:35] And when Satan was kicked out of heaven,
[1:07:37] his ambition did not change. Right. But
[1:07:41] do you ever think here is a devil in
[1:07:45] heaven in a heavenly place with his own
[1:07:49] ambition? Yeah.
[1:07:53] In a heaven with his own desire, what he
[1:07:56] want to do, what he want to be outside
[1:07:58] of God. Yeah, we look at that. Wow,
[1:08:02] that's a devil. But what about sitting
[1:08:05] in church in the presence of God? The
[1:08:08] word going forward. But you can sit
[1:08:10] there with your own ambition of what you
[1:08:11] want to do. Amen. I don't want to hear
[1:08:15] all that. I know I want to do in my
[1:08:16] life. I know that's no different than
[1:08:18] what Satan's situation was. Amen. When
[1:08:21] you come to church, the best time to
[1:08:24] come is when you don't want to come.
[1:08:27] The best time to pray is when you don't
[1:08:28] feel like praying. The best time to sing
[1:08:30] is when you don't feel like singing.
[1:08:32] Amen. Because it becomes a sacrifice.
[1:08:34] Yeah. You push your way through. Amen.
[1:08:37] Can we say amen? We don't want to just
[1:08:39] serve God in the good times, even in the
[1:08:42] worst of time, in the hard times. And
[1:08:44] I'm going tell you right now, I've
[1:08:45] learned God put you in situations where
[1:08:48] there's no human ability you have to get
[1:08:51] out of it. For you'll be forced to trust
[1:08:53] him.
[1:08:55] I call that the love of God. To let us
[1:08:58] know, I don't need your human ability,
[1:09:00] but you need me.
[1:09:05] Amen.
[1:09:08] When I look at the
[1:09:10] scripture even in Genesis 1, in the
[1:09:13] beginning God created the heavens and
[1:09:15] the earth. Earth was without form and
[1:09:17] void. Darkness was upon the face of the
[1:09:19] deep and the spirit of God move upon the
[1:09:22] face of the waters.
[1:09:25] I look at that scripture and and then
[1:09:27] when I read Revelation 17, it says, "And
[1:09:30] he said unto me, the water which thou
[1:09:32] sawest where the horse sitteth are
[1:09:34] peoples, multitudes, and nations and
[1:09:37] tongues." So we know waters also
[1:09:40] represent people.
[1:09:42] But what happened in Genesis when it
[1:09:45] begin to tell
[1:09:47] us in Genesis, we know darkness was
[1:09:50] there, right? Right. Darkness was there
[1:09:55] and seed was there. Yeah. But the seed
[1:09:58] was hindered because the darkness was
[1:10:01] there. So what did God have to do? Move
[1:10:04] back the darkness so that the light can
[1:10:07] strike the seed. Amen. So that right
[1:10:10] there in Genesis then was a physical
[1:10:13] darkness. Right? It was a physical
[1:10:16] darkness there. But remember, there's no
[1:10:19] darkness could move if the spirit of God
[1:10:22] don't move first. Amen. The earth
[1:10:25] condition could not change until the
[1:10:28] spirit of God move. Amen. And that's
[1:10:30] what we need more than anything in this
[1:10:32] day. It's the spirit of God to move.
[1:10:36] Are you with me? Now, that don't mean
[1:10:38] you got to run when God's spirit move.
[1:10:40] Some get that twist up. That don't mean
[1:10:42] you're going to leap, jump, and scream
[1:10:44] when the spirit of God move. Some people
[1:10:46] that happen to, some people it doesn't.
[1:10:49] Are you with me? Some sitting right
[1:10:51] there in the church, spirit of God
[1:10:53] moving, they can just be doing just like
[1:10:54] this.
[1:10:57] Then you might get one that run, jump,
[1:10:59] scream. That's fine.
[1:11:02] Amen. But nothing could change to the
[1:11:04] spirit of God move. But when the spirit
[1:11:06] of God moved, what did that light do? It
[1:11:09] struck the seed.
[1:11:12] There was a physical darkness there.
[1:11:16] But yet it was a spiritual one there as
[1:11:19] well.
[1:11:21] Satan.
[1:11:23] Let me read this to
[1:11:25] you. Third
[1:11:28] seal. But barely said, "So Eve got to
[1:11:31] strolling in the garden.
[1:11:34] She ran into the serpent, a very
[1:11:37] polished up sort of
[1:11:39] fellow and and he began now he was on
[1:11:43] the other
[1:11:45] side. God lives, dwells, works in
[1:11:49] humanity, never any other way. Now the
[1:11:52] little humble lady walking along there,
[1:11:54] Satan came up as
[1:11:57] wise, slick, polished sort of fella. He
[1:12:00] wanted to sell her the program. Now,
[1:12:03] here's what I love. He said, "No matter
[1:12:07] how much Satan was around, as long as
[1:12:11] she stayed behind his word, she was all
[1:12:14] right." So, there was a spiritual
[1:12:16] darkness circling around in Genesis.
[1:12:19] Yeah. But it couldn't do nothing. Yeah.
[1:12:22] Right. Amen. As long as Eve them stood
[1:12:25] behind the word, darkness was spiritual
[1:12:28] darkness was around him, but he couldn't
[1:12:30] do nothing. Yeah. Right. Think about you
[1:12:33] and me in this dark age. As long as you
[1:12:36] stand behind the word, the darkness all
[1:12:38] around us, but it can't do nothing to
[1:12:40] you as long as you stand behind that
[1:12:42] word.
[1:12:48] No matter how much Satan was around, as
[1:12:50] long as she stayed behind this word, she
[1:12:52] was all right. So let Satan do whatever
[1:12:56] he wants to.
[1:12:58] You just stay with the word. Don't make
[1:13:01] a bit of different. If he says while
[1:13:04] you're
[1:13:05] sick, you say by his stripes I'm healed.
[1:13:08] See, while you're going to die, he will
[1:13:11] raise me up again. See, he promised. He
[1:13:14] just showing us even when darkness is
[1:13:16] around you, even try to speak to you,
[1:13:18] you just stay with the word. But what do
[1:13:21] people that do? Let reasoning
[1:13:25] let reasoning sets in. Amen.
[1:13:30] We don't have to do
[1:13:36] that.
[1:13:39] Reasoning it actually mean the process
[1:13:42] of forming conclusions, judgments or
[1:13:45] interferences from facts or premises.
[1:13:48] The act or process of reaching a
[1:13:50] decision or a
[1:13:52] conclusion. That's what reasoning mean.
[1:13:54] Other words, things going back and forth
[1:13:56] in the mind to come to a conclusion. It
[1:14:00] either going to be I'm not going to
[1:14:02] believe or I'm going to doubt. Reasoning
[1:14:04] is a very powerful spirit.
[1:14:07] Amen. There's family
[1:14:09] reasonings, church reasonings,
[1:14:12] individual reasoning. People reason but
[1:14:15] don't look into the word and see what
[1:14:17] the word says. Amen. Y are you with me?
[1:14:21] Amen. The Bible tells us, "For the
[1:14:23] weapon of our welfare are not carnal,
[1:14:26] but mighty through God to pulling down
[1:14:28] the strongholds, casting down
[1:14:30] imagination, everything high thing that
[1:14:32] exalted itself against the knowledge of
[1:14:34] God and bringing into captivity. Every
[1:14:37] thought to the obedience of Christ,
[1:14:39] every thought bringing it into
[1:14:41] captivity." What did he say?
[1:14:43] Faith disagrees. Yeah. Amen. When
[1:14:46] reasoning come with something negative,
[1:14:48] what does faith do? It stands up and it
[1:14:50] disagrees. Amen.
[1:14:54] Are we all right this morning? We'll get
[1:14:57] a little personal, but just stay right
[1:14:58] in there with me.
[1:15:05] Reasoning. Brother Brandon give
[1:15:08] definitions of reasoning, not what
[1:15:10] Webster gives, but I also like his
[1:15:16] better in the message. the uncertain
[1:15:20] sound. He said
[1:15:23] reasoning tries to find a way out.
[1:15:31] He said, "Reasoning, cast down
[1:15:33] reasoning. Cast them down. God don't
[1:15:36] want you to have reason. Reason always
[1:15:39] tries to find a way out. Faith don't
[1:15:43] reason.
[1:15:45] Faith just believes." Yes, your mind you
[1:15:48] make. He said, "What makes you reason?"
[1:15:51] It's a liar. The lie detector proves
[1:15:54] that. God's Bible first proves it. But
[1:15:56] your soul is immortal, brother, sister.
[1:15:59] Your reasoning power will leave you when
[1:16:01] death strike you. But your soul will be
[1:16:04] with you through eternity. Won't you
[1:16:06] believe God's word today and accept him?
[1:16:08] Reasoning.
[1:16:13] Then he began to say reasoning.
[1:16:19] He said now the enemy spy this come from
[1:16:21] the message the trumpet gives an
[1:16:23] uncertain sound tried to find out what
[1:16:26] he could do to break into that so he
[1:16:28] know he couldn't just come out and bluff
[1:16:29] her talking about the devil talking to
[1:16:31] Eve only thing he could do was to get
[1:16:34] her on reasoning and that's what he uses
[1:16:37] he well he said that's what God used
[1:16:39] today to fortify his church is his word
[1:16:42] Satan comes around with reasoning power.
[1:16:46] Satan know that was a loophole. That was
[1:16:49] the place that people would break the
[1:16:51] easiest was
[1:16:52] reasoning. I'm just trying to present to
[1:16:55] you the power of reasoning where make
[1:16:57] people break the easiest and it always
[1:17:00] looking for a way out. That's why you
[1:17:03] got divorcing stuff. People don't let a
[1:17:05] reasoning spirit get upon them and they
[1:17:07] looking for a way out of the marriage
[1:17:09] instead of having faith in the word.
[1:17:11] Say, "Lord, show me where my fault is
[1:17:13] at, my wife fault is at so we can get to
[1:17:16] the word and keep this thing together."
[1:17:19] Right? But reasoning,
[1:17:21] Yeah. I knew it. I shouldn't have
[1:17:24] married her. Right.
[1:17:26] I made a big mistake. People warn me not
[1:17:29] to do it. So, I got the wrong one. So, I
[1:17:32] think I need to leave this situation.
[1:17:33] That's reasoning. Yeah. But faith come
[1:17:35] back say, "But you made a vow."
[1:17:38] Amen. Amen. Yes.
[1:17:42] And faith said and and the preacher he
[1:17:45] said you made a vow and the preacher and
[1:17:47] you agreed. Yeah. Until death do we
[1:17:50] part. Good, better, worse, ugly, bad,
[1:17:54] sad, don't make no difference.
[1:17:57] Are you with me? Amen. But reasoning
[1:18:00] will work it way until you when you one
[1:18:04] thing about reason when you accept what
[1:18:05] it gives you, it gives you a fake piece
[1:18:09] that you're actually right and 100%
[1:18:12] wrong. Yeah. Right. Hello, somebody.
[1:18:16] Amen.
[1:18:27] This come from the whole armor of
[1:18:29] God. When Jesus of Naz were here on
[1:18:32] earth, he never used his
[1:18:34] power. Yet he was God manifested in
[1:18:38] flesh. He never used his power when
[1:18:40] Satan came against him. You notice he
[1:18:43] didn't use his power when Satan came
[1:18:45] against it, right? Amen. That's
[1:18:47] powerful. Yeah. But he was showing you
[1:18:50] and
[1:18:51] me, you don't have to go, "Oh, devil, I
[1:18:54] got all power down." No. He uses his
[1:18:56] word. Amen. And you know where you're at
[1:18:59] in the word. God showed us the pattern.
[1:19:01] You can do the exact same thing. Amen.
[1:19:05] Are we together? Yeah. He was God
[1:19:07] manifest in the flesh. He never used his
[1:19:09] power when Satan came against him. He
[1:19:11] said, "It is written." He had to do that
[1:19:15] because Eve broke down on that. What Eve
[1:19:19] lost, Christ regained. What Eve let
[1:19:22] down, Christ fortified again. It is
[1:19:25] written, "Man shall not live by bread
[1:19:27] alone." It is written, "Thou shalt not
[1:19:28] attempt the Lord thy God." It is
[1:19:30] written, what is it? He stayed with the
[1:19:33] original artillery.
[1:19:35] Amen. I like how he put it. The original
[1:19:38] artillery. Yeah. If any of you in
[1:19:41] military or been in military and and you
[1:19:43] like to like guns and stuff and the new
[1:19:45] advanced military stuff they come out,
[1:19:47] you be reading getting excited. Say,
[1:19:49] "Wow, what a weapon the US got now." You
[1:19:52] just excited. But you know what? God
[1:19:55] never changes. Amen. Amen. It make no
[1:19:59] difference what ages, what years past
[1:20:01] his word is the same and it be defeats
[1:20:04] the devil the same. You and I are using
[1:20:07] the same word Luther used. Amen. Is that
[1:20:10] right? But you can't take Lutheran
[1:20:13] message and survive this day. Yeah. But
[1:20:17] we got the same Bible. But what is the
[1:20:19] difference instead of anointing? Amen.
[1:20:22] Can we say praise the Lord? It's what
[1:20:24] God has released in this day. Yeah. But
[1:20:26] yet the same word.
[1:20:31] She begin to listen to reasoning. And
[1:20:34] that's where people today who can almost
[1:20:36] reason you right down prove to you that
[1:20:39] thing is wrong. Satan was very
[1:20:41] successful with ease. What does
[1:20:43] reasoning do? It makes it
[1:20:46] appealing. So he I read three things.
[1:20:49] Reason Satan know it make people break
[1:20:51] the easiest. And then he also said
[1:20:54] reasoning it is
[1:20:55] appealing. I can't remember what the
[1:20:57] third one is right off my head but I go
[1:20:59] back and read. make people break the
[1:21:01] eases and it's appealing and it always
[1:21:04] try to find a way out. That's right.
[1:21:12] Marriages is being attacked so hard
[1:21:19] now and many give
[1:21:21] up. But what they don't realize when
[1:21:24] they give up what it cost to happen to
[1:21:27] the children. That's right. preach.
[1:21:30] That's what they don't understand what
[1:21:32] happened to the children. Yeah.
[1:21:37] I was reading an article where they
[1:21:40] talking about why now why the younger
[1:21:42] generation really don't want to get
[1:21:44] married. They'll rather just shack up
[1:21:46] because they see they see so much
[1:21:48] divorce.
[1:21:53] That's the world. But it shouldn't be
[1:21:55] us.
[1:21:58] Amen. It shouldn't be because let me
[1:22:01] tell you, I believe this is a perfect
[1:22:04] message.
[1:22:05] We get the Holy Ghost, apply the word to
[1:22:07] us, it'll perfect our lives. It'll
[1:22:10] perfect our marriage. I believe that
[1:22:13] with all of my heart.
[1:22:16] There's nothing can separate me and my
[1:22:18] wife.
[1:22:20] And our marriage is not perfect, but we
[1:22:22] sure striving for it. It might take more
[1:22:25] and more. We've been together 38 years.
[1:22:28] We still working on it. Amen. And it's
[1:22:30] good. Yeah. Amen. Cuz I begin to learn
[1:22:35] more and more how reasoning acts. I've
[1:22:39] been knowing these things, but I'm
[1:22:41] looking into it more and more.
[1:22:47] God, I hope they don't watch the sermon.
[1:22:50] I'm gonna make a example, somebody. I
[1:22:51] hope they don't.
[1:22:54] I ain't going to call their name, but I
[1:22:56] just hope they don't listen to this
[1:22:58] sermon. This little couple got married.
[1:23:02] They've been married about two years
[1:23:04] now. And the young man talks to me a
[1:23:08] lot. But when he talks to me, I be
[1:23:11] laughing. I don't want to laugh, but I
[1:23:12] just a thought become in my mind cuz I
[1:23:14] know it's something I already he don't
[1:23:16] sat in the church year. I know I already
[1:23:18] preached it. So I'm
[1:23:19] like, where were you?
[1:23:23] Let him
[1:23:25] talk. Let him
[1:23:29] talk. The Bible makes it very plain. A
[1:23:33] woman is a weaker
[1:23:35] vessel. Sister, say, "Amen."
[1:23:39] Look at your husband. Say, "I'm the
[1:23:40] weaker
[1:23:43] vessel." You got to look at
[1:23:46] him and say it.
[1:23:53] But say, "Honey, I'm the weaker vessel,
[1:23:56] but I'm not weak."
[1:23:59] Say it.
[1:24:03] Some of you like you need a
[1:24:04] chiropractor. You want to turn your
[1:24:10] head. Now, husband, look at your
[1:24:13] wife and say, "God couldn't give me
[1:24:17] nothing better.
[1:24:20] That's outside of salvation. But you
[1:24:29] Why some of you say it and one looking
[1:24:32] straight, but you can't even look at
[1:24:34] each other and say
[1:24:39] it.
[1:24:43] Huh? Like he's straining to say it. If
[1:24:47] you're straining to say that, that's
[1:24:49] because something going
[1:24:53] wrong. Something going wrong. Cuz if
[1:24:56] everything were good, you can just look
[1:24:58] right at each other and say it.
[1:25:01] But that
[1:25:05] strength and I can promise
[1:25:08] you, you've been battling with
[1:25:10] reasoning.
[1:25:14] You know, I told my
[1:25:18] wife, I said,
[1:25:20] "Honey," I said, "I want you to repeat
[1:25:22] after
[1:25:23] me." She said,
[1:25:27] "Okay." She looked right at me, said,
[1:25:30] "Honey." She said,
[1:25:32] "Honey, as of today, as of
[1:25:35] today, all of my arsenal, all of my
[1:25:39] arsenal, I'mma destroy it. I'mma destroy
[1:25:42] it. That's okay. Do y'all know what that
[1:25:49] mean? Some of you
[1:25:51] don't. In the military term, arsenal
[1:25:54] mean stored up weapons.
[1:25:59] Military term stored up weapons.
[1:26:05] So what that means, husband and wives
[1:26:07] got arsenal.
[1:26:11] Oh, you like
[1:26:13] Oh, you
[1:26:14] do when she if she offends you or do
[1:26:17] something that wasn't right. Said, "I
[1:26:19] ain't going to say nothing
[1:26:22] now. I'll wait for later." You just
[1:26:25] stored Arsenal.
[1:26:32] Oh, I didn't like what he did, but I
[1:26:35] ain't going to say nothing.
[1:26:37] I'll wait later. You put it in your
[1:26:39] arsenal.
[1:26:43] And it's wrong. Yeah. Amen.
[1:26:47] Some of you got bazookas, dynamite,
[1:26:50] grenades, and everything in your arsenal
[1:26:54] and you just waiting for the argument to
[1:26:56] come up. Which one going to be the right
[1:26:58] one to pick?
[1:27:01] What you think happening when you and
[1:27:02] your wife have a disagreement and you
[1:27:05] trying to explain something and the
[1:27:07] other one be going like, "Mhm." Yeah.
[1:27:10] Mhm. They're not listening to you.
[1:27:12] They're just wait while you're saying
[1:27:14] that they're looking in their arsenal
[1:27:17] which one they gonna use to come back at
[1:27:20] you.
[1:27:21] You know that's wrong. Yeah.
[1:27:24] You're laughing but it's wrong.
[1:27:29] Got to lay it down. Amen.
[1:27:32] The best way to kill that arsenal is
[1:27:35] don't let stuff build up.
[1:27:39] Hello. Don't let it build up.
[1:27:43] But there is a
[1:27:45] wisdom to that side.
[1:27:49] Sometimes you can discern they didn't
[1:27:51] really mean
[1:27:52] that. But that have to be addressed.
[1:27:56] I'll just wait for later to address it
[1:27:59] cuz right now ain't going to happen.
[1:28:01] Yeah, that's not putting in the arsenal
[1:28:03] for an attack, but waiting for the right
[1:28:06] time to deal with the situation.
[1:28:10] But when you just storing them all up,
[1:28:12] I'll wait. I know he going to come back.
[1:28:14] He going to say something or she
[1:28:16] or that's wrong. Amen.
[1:28:21] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:28:25] My wife asked me, she said,
[1:28:27] "Burley, we made an agreement on
[1:28:30] Arsenal." She said, "Is that agreement
[1:28:32] just between you and me or that means
[1:28:36] everybody?" I said, "That's everybody.
[1:28:39] Everybody that you don't put some
[1:28:40] arsenal up to say something, you waiting
[1:28:43] on them." I said, "You got to kill all
[1:28:45] that stuff." Amen.
[1:28:48] She said, "But what if it bothers me
[1:28:50] when I think about it?" I said, "Oh,
[1:28:53] that means you got to go to that person
[1:28:57] and talk to them." I said, "That's what
[1:29:00] that means." I said, "Oh, yeah." I had a
[1:29:04] young lady come to the
[1:29:05] line, prayer line, a couple weeks
[1:29:09] ago. I was just preaching. I was
[1:29:11] preaching about how some people leave
[1:29:13] the church so quick. They don't want you
[1:29:15] to say nothing to them. They don't want
[1:29:16] you talk to them. They just say, "Hey, I
[1:29:18] came here to do my dude. I just want to
[1:29:20] hear the word. I'm
[1:29:23] out." That's
[1:29:25] bad. And they think they getting
[1:29:27] somewhere with God. With that kind of
[1:29:28] attitude, you ain't getting nowhere with
[1:29:30] God like
[1:29:31] that. Then somebody come, hey, how you
[1:29:33] doing? I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.
[1:29:35] Just go. But then all of a sudden, they
[1:29:37] do it so much people get used to them
[1:29:39] doing it. People don't say nothing to
[1:29:41] them. They take off and leave. And then
[1:29:42] it's then it flips back on them. Now
[1:29:45] they like, "No, nobody care about
[1:29:48] me. Nobody care about me." No, somebody
[1:29:50] tried to care about you, but you just
[1:29:52] kept presenting that energy. Say, "Hey,
[1:29:54] I give you your space." See, that done
[1:29:57] flipped around. Yeah. What it is is
[1:29:59] childish. Amen. That's what it is. Are
[1:30:03] you with me? Amen. You going to shake
[1:30:05] nobody hand? No. No. No. No. That's
[1:30:08] wrong.
[1:30:11] God can't deal with you like that. you
[1:30:14] going to have now deal with
[1:30:16] yourself. And I was just saying then a
[1:30:19] sister came up to the altar. She said,
[1:30:21] "What you said is me." I said, "Woo!"
[1:30:25] She said, "What you just said?" She
[1:30:27] said, "I don't came to preachers after
[1:30:29] preachers to help pray with me with this
[1:30:32] situation." And now here I'm with you. I
[1:30:34] said, "Well, this going to be your last
[1:30:36] stop. I can promise you that." That's
[1:30:38] cuz the problem is you. Mhm.
[1:30:42] I said, "The only way you going to break
[1:30:44] that your resentments run to your car."
[1:30:47] I said, "There's only one way to break
[1:30:49] it. Every person you got the resentment,
[1:30:52] you got to go to him."
[1:30:55] And I said, "You might even be the one
[1:30:56] wrong, not even them." So, you go make
[1:30:59] it right, you'll crush that devil.
[1:31:03] That's the only way to get out of those
[1:31:04] kinds is to be honest. Are you with me?
[1:31:08] Amen.
[1:31:10] But that reasoning, no, I ain't got to
[1:31:12] shake nobody hand. They ain't shake
[1:31:13] mine. So whatever. No reasoning. That
[1:31:17] stuff can kill you.
[1:31:19] Are you with me? Can y'all give me a few
[1:31:22] more minutes?
[1:31:26] These things can be
[1:31:31] broken. Praise the Lord. Amen. I love my
[1:31:35] wife. I can joke with her, have fun with
[1:31:38] her, but I know when she have bad times,
[1:31:41] she know when I have bad times. We just
[1:31:44] learn through the years to respect one
[1:31:46] another.
[1:31:48] I told her, I said, I told my wife, I
[1:31:51] said, "I understand you better than you
[1:31:53] understand yourself." She said, "How can
[1:31:55] you say that?" I said, "Cuz I
[1:31:57] do." And I can start explaining her own
[1:32:00] life to her.
[1:32:03] you I said you know what one of your
[1:32:05] problem is she don't mind me saying that
[1:32:07] she said what I said one problem you got
[1:32:09] in life if you let your mind go too far
[1:32:12] before something
[1:32:14] happened what do you mean I said I'll
[1:32:16] give you an example I said uh we need to
[1:32:20] go somewhere and do the I said you'll be
[1:32:22] like oh that's a long drive my back
[1:32:25] could be hurting my head could be that
[1:32:26] drive is long I said you already done
[1:32:28] put your body in a predicament and it
[1:32:30] ain't happened Yeah,
[1:32:33] you don't let your mind go way down
[1:32:35] there.
[1:32:37] But I can talk to her about it because I
[1:32:39] know there's a weakness that the enemy
[1:32:42] could use in her mind
[1:32:44] on her even on spiritual things if she's
[1:32:47] not careful.
[1:32:50] The greatest badest fault. Right. Amen.
[1:32:53] Right here. Yeah. It's so easy to paint
[1:32:56] a picture of something that's not even
[1:32:57] real. Yeah. Right. Yes, sir. It's very
[1:33:00] easy to do. But faith disagrees with
[1:33:04] that stuff.
[1:33:07] When a thought try to come situation by
[1:33:09] a brother, no, no, no, that's not my
[1:33:10] brother. That's not my sister. I'mma
[1:33:12] kill that right now. But I'll go talk to
[1:33:16] her. That's what I'll do. Mm- No. As a
[1:33:21] pastor, you deal with church problems
[1:33:23] and your own personal family problems.
[1:33:25] It builds upon you. Hey, you really need
[1:33:28] help from God. God can put you in
[1:33:30] situations, nobody can help you but him.
[1:33:35] Are you with me? Amen. I'm so amazed now
[1:33:39] you get sinners popping up in the church
[1:33:42] grasping hold to the word of God than
[1:33:44] some of the believers. What's happen the
[1:33:47] message becoming common
[1:33:50] becoming common to them but then yet
[1:33:53] somebody else is thirsty for it. That's
[1:33:55] why we can't let this gospel become
[1:33:57] common to us
[1:34:00] the younger generation need to lay in
[1:34:02] this bless message
[1:34:04] just like we did. Amen. Come to this
[1:34:07] altar, get a true experience with God
[1:34:09] just like we did. Nobody made us do it.
[1:34:12] We was hungry for it.
[1:34:15] Same thing got to happen today to them.
[1:34:18] Are you with me? Amen.
[1:34:24] A lot of immature
[1:34:26] things is
[1:34:28] disturbing when it shouldn't
[1:34:31] be. We supposed to be
[1:34:34] examples, living examples. Is that
[1:34:37] right? It's pressure. It's pressure on
[1:34:39] pastors. Pressure is on pastor's wife.
[1:34:41] Pressure is on the pastor's family. It's
[1:34:43] pressure on all of us. But you can rest
[1:34:47] assure the devil attack going to be at
[1:34:49] your pastor.
[1:34:53] You rest assure.
[1:34:56] Why? Try to get to the man ministry.
[1:34:59] Yeah.
[1:35:03] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:05] That's why so many
[1:35:07] examples we we preach about everything.
[1:35:10] Seals, we preach about it all. But look
[1:35:13] at all the examples brother Brandon even
[1:35:15] give about when his wife lost her
[1:35:17] temple. How he dealt with the temple.
[1:35:20] Her temple. How he dealt with it. Yeah.
[1:35:22] It's so many things in there to show you
[1:35:25] how everything we need, every story in
[1:35:28] the message. Yeah. It's for a purpose.
[1:35:31] We can draw strength from it. It's
[1:35:34] there.
[1:35:35] Amen. And I look at him. I look at him.
[1:35:38] Wow. Here's a prophet that humbled
[1:35:41] himself down to put on an apron
[1:35:45] and wash dishes.
[1:35:49] Some some brother when you be talking
[1:35:50] about they be you can see them already
[1:35:52] going
[1:35:54] man. I'm a
[1:35:56] man. Then you start talking about the
[1:35:58] seals. Yeah, brother. Come on. Yeah.
[1:36:01] Yeah. Yeah. The prophet put that apron
[1:36:02] on. Wash them
[1:36:06] dishes. Amen. He gave an example of
[1:36:09] everything.
[1:36:12] And I abide by him. Amen. Cuz I learned
[1:36:14] from him. Yeah.
[1:36:17] Praise the Lord. What about the story
[1:36:20] complaining about her husband? I think
[1:36:22] Billy Paul told that story. Sister is
[1:36:25] running her husband down. Brother
[1:36:26] Brandon said, "What time your husband
[1:36:27] get home?" She said, "Such such time."
[1:36:30] What's his favorite pie? Such pie. He
[1:36:32] got enough time to get home to make it
[1:36:34] for him before he get there.
[1:36:40] Oh, now my thought come back to me. Let
[1:36:43] me explain something to
[1:36:47] you. How is Christ creating his
[1:36:53] bride? Word. Amen.
[1:36:56] Ephesians 5 says, "What is he doing for
[1:37:01] his bride to present
[1:37:04] to himself?" Yeah.
[1:37:07] A glorious
[1:37:09] church. Is that right? Amen. How's he
[1:37:12] doing it? By the washing and the water
[1:37:17] of the word. Amen. So Christ uses the
[1:37:20] word cuz he know exactly about how he
[1:37:22] want his bride to be dressed to present
[1:37:25] her to himself. Yeah.
[1:37:28] So you and I are being created
[1:37:31] by the word. Amen. Is that right? That's
[1:37:34] right.
[1:37:37] Don't you know there's the exact same
[1:37:38] thing with marriage
[1:37:42] brothers? You can create your family
[1:37:46] by the
[1:37:48] word, your wife, especially this is what
[1:37:52] I preach to young people. I just got to
[1:37:54] lay it out. in
[1:37:57] courtship. In courtship, I tell young
[1:38:00] men, "This is the perfect time for you
[1:38:04] to create your
[1:38:07] bride." They're like, "Yeah, I was
[1:38:10] talking to one of them." I said, "Yes."
[1:38:11] I said,
[1:38:12] "Well, they had got married, but still
[1:38:14] it works in courtship. They were young.
[1:38:16] He was this this come back." I said,
[1:38:19] "Hold on, fella. How long?" I said,
[1:38:22] "You're in the perfect shape right now
[1:38:25] to create her." I said, "Cuz marriage is
[1:38:29] based
[1:38:30] on what you plant is what you reap."
[1:38:34] Yeah. I said, "So what seed you going to
[1:38:37] sew to her now is what she going to give
[1:38:39] back to you." I said, "You're in the
[1:38:42] perfect place." You
[1:38:45] look at the scripture. Yeah. Husband,
[1:38:47] love your wives as Yeah. Christ loved
[1:38:51] the church and gave himself for it. I
[1:38:53] said, "Now you got to give
[1:38:55] yourself." I said, "You got to see
[1:38:58] sometime you talk to young people, I
[1:38:59] say, marriage is compromised." Oh, I
[1:39:01] ain't compromising. I'm tough. I'm a man
[1:39:04] of God. Look, I ain't compromised. I
[1:39:06] never said compromise on the word.
[1:39:08] Right. I said compromise.
[1:39:12] Amen. You got to give up your little
[1:39:14] personal rights. Yeah. Right. To help
[1:39:18] her. Amen. Vice versa, give up your
[1:39:20] personal rights to help him, you're
[1:39:23] creating a family. Yeah. Amen. Amen.
[1:39:29] That's why sometimes, brothers, when
[1:39:30] your wife say something to you, you get
[1:39:33] mad. But if you listen to what she's
[1:39:35] saying, it's something you said to her.
[1:39:37] She's just repeating it back to you.
[1:39:42] How could you say that? Then there goes
[1:39:43] the arsenal. You said it to me.
[1:39:46] That's what you said.
[1:39:49] That stuff wrong. It's just wrong. We're
[1:39:52] supposed to be a gospel family. Yeah.
[1:39:55] Take that word and whack down every
[1:39:57] little reason the devil tried to come in
[1:39:59] and destroy the family and take that
[1:40:01] word and tear it down. Amen. I believe
[1:40:03] that with all of my heart. Yeah. Praise
[1:40:06] God.
[1:40:08] There's an
[1:40:12] article. My son married now. Matter of
[1:40:16] fact, they had their first little
[1:40:17] baby Saturday
[1:40:20] coming. I read it to
[1:40:25] him. When him and my daughter-in-law was
[1:40:29] in courtship, they caught it five
[1:40:31] years. And when they got married, that
[1:40:34] were their first time ever kissing. They
[1:40:36] stayed away from all that five years.
[1:40:42] Unfortunately, my son had an up and down
[1:40:45] life struggling. He didn't live a good
[1:40:48] life. He had a little taste of the world
[1:40:51] in him. But I'm thankful for where he's
[1:40:53] at now through prayer.
[1:40:57] But his wife, I thank God for her
[1:41:00] mother, kept her from that. She didn't
[1:41:01] have no father. Stay stayed on her.
[1:41:04] Stayed on her. Stayed on her.
[1:41:07] So when it was when they got married, we
[1:41:10] went out to
[1:41:12] eat and I was going to my truck and I
[1:41:15] happened to look back and I looked at
[1:41:18] them and she she was walking beside him.
[1:41:21] She was doing like
[1:41:22] this and my son were doing like
[1:41:26] this. I looked
[1:41:29] back. I said, "Wow, look at that." What
[1:41:33] that actually was, it's an article I
[1:41:36] read. They says when you see a woman act
[1:41:41] like a child, that means she feels
[1:41:44] secure and protected by her man.
[1:41:52] Come on, sister.
[1:41:56] When you know that man going to protect
[1:41:58] you, you got no question. You could just
[1:42:03] [Applause]
[1:42:08] But if he got you got a wondering a
[1:42:10] little insecurity, you going to be
[1:42:14] you going to ask a bunch of questions
[1:42:16] cuz there a little insecurity.
[1:42:22] Y'all want me to quit? No.
[1:42:25] Cuz some of you
[1:42:28] like, come on, man. Get to it. I'm
[1:42:31] getting to it.
[1:42:33] Yeah, I'm getting to it. So, this ain't
[1:42:36] the message. Yes, it is.
[1:42:39] Yes, it is. Amen. Cuz our relationship
[1:42:43] with one another should be reflecting
[1:42:46] the same thing with Christ and his
[1:42:48] bride. Amen. It should reflect the same
[1:42:50] thing. Amen.
[1:42:53] With that
[1:42:54] reasoning, I reason with my wife.
[1:42:57] I be
[1:42:59] joking. My house is messed up. Need
[1:43:02] remodeling. I'm always working on other
[1:43:04] people house, but if I get home just
[1:43:07] tired. But now I done it so long I feel
[1:43:10] so guilty. Now I got to fix
[1:43:12] it. But I reason with her in a joking
[1:43:15] way. I said, "You know why this house
[1:43:16] ain't been fixed?" She said, "Why?" I
[1:43:19] said, "It's your
[1:43:21] fault." She said, "What do you mean?" I
[1:43:23] said, "It's your lack of faith.
[1:43:27] I said, "Because you don't believe in
[1:43:28] me, I can't work on the house. There's
[1:43:31] many things Jesus couldn't do because of
[1:43:33] unbelief." I said, "So, it's your
[1:43:40] fault. I was just joking down there. I
[1:43:44] don't want y'all." No, I was just
[1:43:47] joking. But I got to fix it cuz she been
[1:43:50] so good to me and now it's really bother
[1:43:52] me. But I just be tired. No excuse.
[1:43:55] No
[1:43:56] excuse. Cuz
[1:44:01] I I was dealing with this situation just
[1:44:03] last week.
[1:44:08] Are we okay?
[1:44:11] Amen. This young
[1:44:13] guy courting a girl, young
[1:44:18] girl, and she's the baby of the
[1:44:21] family. Y'all know that means something,
[1:44:24] right?
[1:44:26] He calling me brother
[1:44:28] Bley.
[1:44:31] Yeah. He said
[1:44:34] uh he said I said I I like her and all
[1:44:39] that. He said we got an argument. I said
[1:44:42] argument. Yeah. He said he said I said
[1:44:46] he said it's so childish. I don't even
[1:44:47] want to tell you. I said what is it? He
[1:44:50] said it was over a
[1:44:51] tie. That's okay. He said, "I'm going to
[1:44:57] her church this weekend and she want us
[1:44:59] to dress the same and she didn't like
[1:45:00] the tie and she said she don't really
[1:45:02] don't want to take picture with me if I
[1:45:03] didn't wear that tie." He said, "Dad is
[1:45:05] just so
[1:45:07] childish." I said,
[1:45:09] "Okay." I said, "Let me explain
[1:45:11] something to you, young
[1:45:13] man." I said, "What it is is pride." She
[1:45:16] got pride. I said, "But it's a good one,
[1:45:18] sisters."
[1:45:20] I said, "Brother, he's just young." I
[1:45:23] said,
[1:45:24] "Brother, some women like to dress their
[1:45:28] man and some just don't care what he put
[1:45:31] on as long as he
[1:45:33] decent." I said, "So, you got to
[1:45:35] understand that." He
[1:45:38] said, I said, "Her pride, but it's not a
[1:45:41] bad one. She want to when you come
[1:45:43] visit, she just want to smile and
[1:45:45] everything all right."
[1:45:47] He said, "But brother Burlet," then she
[1:45:49] said, "She don't want to take going to
[1:45:50] take a picture." I said, "Okay, we'll
[1:45:52] get to that one later." And I
[1:45:54] did. I got the dad on the phone. I
[1:45:57] called the dad, talked to the young
[1:45:59] girl. I said, "The brother told me this
[1:46:02] incident that happened." Yeah. I said,
[1:46:05] "You know that's childish, right?" She
[1:46:08] got quiet. I said, "That's
[1:46:10] childish." I said, "It is." I said I
[1:46:14] said you're a baby in his family and you
[1:46:17] want your way. I said don't work like
[1:46:19] that. I said because you're a baby. You
[1:46:21] want to have it just the way you want it
[1:46:23] and you want a man like your daddy that
[1:46:26] don't always happen. I said it was
[1:46:29] childish. What did it do? Broke
[1:46:31] everything down. Now they moving right
[1:46:34] along. Yeah.
[1:46:36] I said, "Brother, that's life." Yeah.
[1:46:39] Right. There's certain little things
[1:46:42] that
[1:46:43] happens. For
[1:46:44] instance, I explained to him. I said,
[1:46:47] "I'm going to show you how it works."
[1:46:49] Right
[1:46:51] now, if my wife was watching this
[1:46:55] service and I had the wrong color towel
[1:46:58] on, she would probably not watch the
[1:47:03] service cuz the only thing she going to
[1:47:06] see is the tie is wrong.
[1:47:12] But she maturing now. She told me the
[1:47:15] other week, she said,
[1:47:16] "Barely, I can't believe what you did."
[1:47:18] I said, "What did I do?" She said, "As
[1:47:22] hard as I earned that shirt and you
[1:47:25] didn't even take that jacket off when
[1:47:27] you was preaching. You preached in the I
[1:47:29] said, "Really, niece?" She said, "Yeah,
[1:47:32] I repented to the Lord." I said, "Lord,
[1:47:33] I can't be looking at that. I need to
[1:47:34] get in the word." She said, "I made it
[1:47:36] over it.
[1:47:37] I just gave him that example.
[1:47:41] Cuz you have to learn to
[1:47:44] understand one another. Not versus how
[1:47:47] you want one another to be, but look at
[1:47:50] one for what they are. Amen.
[1:47:55] Cuz long you pulling them to your mold,
[1:47:57] I need you to be like this.
[1:48:00] It's going to be an argument. Amen.
[1:48:02] Yeah. But when you can start looking
[1:48:05] into their heart, I understand. Oh, I
[1:48:07] see. I see. It go a whole lot smoother.
[1:48:11] Yeah.
[1:48:13] But that reasoning,
[1:48:16] I'm a man. I'm the head. I'm the leader.
[1:48:19] She going to do what I say. It's going
[1:48:21] to be the way I
[1:48:22] say. You even got the word but applying
[1:48:25] it wrong.
[1:48:27] That ain't the way it go. See, the
[1:48:29] problem is she weak anyway. She need to
[1:48:30] acknowledge she's a weak vessel. That's
[1:48:32] what she needed. I said, "Yeah, but the
[1:48:34] scripture said, dwell with them
[1:48:36] according to knowledge."
[1:48:39] And knowledge grows.
[1:48:42] So as you live together, you begin to
[1:48:44] learn more knowledge about her, what to
[1:48:46] do and what not to do. It grows.
[1:48:51] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:48:54] So if a
[1:48:56] sister is like that, want her man to be
[1:48:59] dressed right, I just flip it back. I
[1:49:02] said, "Now, how much more God want you
[1:49:04] to reflect him
[1:49:06] dressing right?
[1:49:10] It just loops around."
[1:49:12] But the word, we create our children. We
[1:49:16] create the church. We are created by the
[1:49:19] word. That's why when you really have a
[1:49:22] revelation of the message, you'll see
[1:49:25] Revelation 10:7, Malachi 4 in the people
[1:49:28] lives. Yeah. Amen. Cuz that's the word
[1:49:30] you don't receive. Yeah. Amen. Amen. Are
[1:49:35] you with me? Yeah, sir. We are creators
[1:49:39] by the things that we speak. Amen. But
[1:49:42] reasoning try to kills everything. Yeah.
[1:49:46] Yeah. It really does. Amen. But we can
[1:49:48] cast all that stuff down. What did
[1:49:51] brother Brandon do when he went and
[1:49:54] talked to the Lord? He interceded for
[1:49:56] his wife. He said, "I'm always gone, but
[1:49:59] she always taking care of my clothes.
[1:50:00] She He was interceding. He pointed out
[1:50:03] all of her good parts to God."
[1:50:07] Can we say amen? That's why even as a
[1:50:10] man sometime uh wives go through thing,
[1:50:13] changes of life. It's not easy.
[1:50:17] But it's a very simple quote. Prophet
[1:50:20] said, "Let her know you she's still your
[1:50:21] sweetheart."
[1:50:24] It can't be like
[1:50:26] really man. Come on now. You know, you
[1:50:30] talk to some brothers. Hey, my wife's
[1:50:31] going through the change of
[1:50:33] life. It is like the end of the
[1:50:36] world. Now, what are you going to do
[1:50:38] about it? Yeah.
[1:50:40] But they don't give excuses, sister, to
[1:50:42] go overboard either.
[1:50:44] You know what I'm going through, so deal
[1:50:46] with it. Oh, see honey, you know what
[1:50:50] I'm going through. I don't mean it. Pray
[1:50:51] for me. Yeah. Amen. Please pray for me
[1:50:54] cuz it's just the way it goes. Yeah. But
[1:50:58] I believe that man has that power.
[1:51:01] Take that
[1:51:02] word. He can control things.
[1:51:08] I'm telling you this from experience.
[1:51:13] My wife just God bless her
[1:51:17] soul. If I'm
[1:51:19] irritated, come home, she can feel
[1:51:22] it. I can't hide it. But she learned I
[1:51:27] walk in the door irritated. She said,
[1:51:30] "You all
[1:51:31] right? I'm
[1:51:33] good." She won't say nothing else. She
[1:51:36] said, "Bar, I know. Just leave you
[1:51:39] alone. No ask no more question because
[1:51:41] I'm I'm figuring out something and I
[1:51:44] don't need no distraction. I just go
[1:51:46] outside, walk around, come back in the
[1:51:48] house. Hey, like nothing ever happened.
[1:51:50] Yeah.
[1:51:52] But she don't be like when I try to talk
[1:51:54] to you, you come in the house like that,
[1:51:56] look at that. Now you want to try to
[1:51:57] talk. No. No. She know I don't work
[1:52:00] through I had to work through something.
[1:52:02] That's understanding one another
[1:52:05] instead of tell me what's wrong. said,
[1:52:08] "I'm okay. I'm going." No. No. I want to
[1:52:12] know. I'm okay. It's going to be fine. I
[1:52:15] know your wife. Yes. Aren't we married?
[1:52:19] Yes. We supposed to be one? Yes. Now
[1:52:23] tell
[1:52:29] me. That ain't going to work.
[1:52:32] Then you push the man in the corner. He
[1:52:33] said, "Okay, I'll tell you this don't
[1:52:36] happen. this and this and this and this.
[1:52:38] Then now you walking around like
[1:52:43] that. You got to have that respect, man.
[1:52:46] Respect and love for one another. Amen.
[1:52:50] And you always compare it to the gospel.
[1:52:53] Amen. That's why a man can't be working
[1:52:56] so much until he just say, "I'm tired.
[1:52:58] I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm
[1:53:00] tired. I'm tired." You want Jesus to do
[1:53:02] you like that? When you come talk to
[1:53:03] him, he say, "I'm tired. I can't talk to
[1:53:05] you." Right. No, you don't want that to
[1:53:07] happen. Amen. You got to apply
[1:53:10] everything with your relationship with
[1:53:12] the Lord.
[1:53:14] See how you come out. One more thing.
[1:53:16] Amen. Are we all right?
[1:53:24] This young guy telling
[1:53:29] me a lot of time people don't understand
[1:53:32] submission.
[1:53:36] Sometime you read that scripture, wives
[1:53:38] submit to your
[1:53:40] husband, they don't go no further than
[1:53:42] submit to your
[1:53:44] husband. Read the rest of it. Amen.
[1:53:49] Ask unto the Lord.
[1:53:53] There goes your answer for everything.
[1:53:55] How do you submit to Jesus?
[1:53:58] Flip it right to your husband.
[1:54:01] Right. Amen. But I can tell you another
[1:54:03] side about submission. Submission, not
[1:54:07] this ain't what Christ side now, but
[1:54:10] sister, I'm going to explain something
[1:54:11] to you. Submission do not believe you
[1:54:14] agree with everything your husband is
[1:54:16] saying.
[1:54:23] Submission. You can even disagree with
[1:54:26] something but still submit to
[1:54:29] it because that's what the word says.
[1:54:32] I'm not talking about nothing
[1:54:33] unscriptural now. Yeah. Right. By you
[1:54:37] submitting, you're doing your part and
[1:54:40] whatever he
[1:54:42] suggested, if it works, you be like,
[1:54:45] "Praise the
[1:54:46] Lord." But you submit to something he
[1:54:49] want you to do and the brother keep
[1:54:52] missing. that's going to make you
[1:54:54] struggle to submit. So now it falls back
[1:54:58] on demand to make sure whatever your
[1:55:00] plan is or wherever you're trying to
[1:55:02] lead your family, you better make sure
[1:55:05] it's right. So they won't start
[1:55:07] wondering about your judgments and your
[1:55:10] actions. Yeah. It works both ways. Yeah.
[1:55:13] Amen. Are you with me? That's right. Cuz
[1:55:15] the more she sees you active in the word
[1:55:18] and everything lining up, you say,
[1:55:20] "Honey, I think we should uh maybe do
[1:55:22] this." She say, "Whatever's whatever you
[1:55:25] feel led to do,
[1:55:27] honey?" Right? But you missing keep
[1:55:31] missing. Well, honey, I really feel led
[1:55:33] to do
[1:55:35] something. You sure this time? Cuz you
[1:55:39] remember the last time I I I mean, I
[1:55:42] done my job. I tried to follow you on
[1:55:43] it, but it failed. Come on now. Right.
[1:55:47] That's why it's so much pressure on the
[1:55:48] man. Prayer. Make sure your decision,
[1:55:51] your actions, you do have the right
[1:55:54] leading of the Lord. Amen. With that
[1:55:56] being said, sometimes sisters, we do
[1:55:58] fail. Then you have to look at the
[1:56:00] integrity.
[1:56:03] You can look and say, "No, I know he
[1:56:04] meant well on that. It didn't work out,
[1:56:06] but that's okay." Are you with me? Amen.
[1:56:09] So, it's so many challenges to balance
[1:56:12] things out before you let
[1:56:15] reasoning just take over. Say, "No, I
[1:56:17] can't. I can't go with that, honey. I'm
[1:56:21] sorry. You don't." Nope. Nope. I'm
[1:56:23] sorry. Then it's
[1:56:26] bad. I told that young I told the young
[1:56:31] girl that explained it to her. I said,
[1:56:32] "But you know
[1:56:37] wisdom, if a man does something in the
[1:56:39] house, sometime men like to get a little
[1:56:41] creative, get you a picture or whatever,
[1:56:44] and he hangs it
[1:56:48] up." How many of you men like to
[1:56:50] surprise your wife
[1:56:52] sometimes? You know, blindfold him. You
[1:56:55] maybe don't got something for her and
[1:56:57] blindfold say hello, hello, hello. Then
[1:57:00] you bring them to maybe it's a picture
[1:57:02] she always wanted. Then all right she
[1:57:06] take your hands off you
[1:57:09] she it's
[1:57:14] crooked. You killed
[1:57:18] everything. You killed
[1:57:20] it. If it's crooked so what? Look what
[1:57:24] he tried to do.
[1:57:26] I
[1:57:27] did. You just say, "Give me a hug." And
[1:57:30] when you're hugging,
[1:57:37] just got to keep the love of God, peace.
[1:57:42] What we're focusing on a gospel home.
[1:57:44] Keep that cuz the devil, he just try to
[1:57:46] get in there with any kind of little
[1:57:48] wedge. Yeah. It creates
[1:57:51] problems. That's true. Amen. Come on.
[1:57:58] She'll cook a wonderful
[1:58:00] dinner. You just sitting there eating
[1:58:03] and she would say, "Do you notice
[1:58:05] anything different?"
[1:58:09] Mm- She said, "But I tried another
[1:58:11] flavor in there." Oh,
[1:58:13] okay. Just keep on eating. Yeah. Been a
[1:58:17] while since I done that one. You just
[1:58:18] keep on eating. Come on, bro.
[1:58:21] She want a compliment.
[1:58:25] That's what she asking you for. All you
[1:58:27] got to say, babe, this is delicious.
[1:58:30] That's what she wanted to hear. But you
[1:58:32] just Mhm.
[1:58:37] You know what that do? Little reasoning
[1:58:39] sets in, I just won't cook it like that
[1:58:42] no more again. He didn't appreciate it,
[1:58:45] so whatever. Nope. You just put
[1:58:48] something in your arsenal. You'll use it
[1:58:50] later on.
[1:58:52] Little bitty things like that. How the
[1:58:54] devil just wreck things. Little stuff.
[1:58:58] Little foxes, small as the vine. Amen.
[1:59:01] It's bad, man.
[1:59:04] Are we all right? Amen.
[1:59:06] Musicians can come. I ain't done. But
[1:59:08] musicians can come. These things really
[1:59:12] I tell you, I I just see it using
[1:59:15] wisdom. Just slam the devil. The devil
[1:59:17] just said, "Man, I can't get nowhere. I
[1:59:20] got no crack to get in." just slams him
[1:59:23] cuz that's we want peace in the home,
[1:59:25] peace in our life and stand behind that
[1:59:27] word. Yet darkness all around us but
[1:59:30] let's stay in our position, stay in our
[1:59:32] place. Amen. And you watch what God will
[1:59:35] do. Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a
[1:59:38] hand.
[1:59:48] Amen. May the Lord bless you. keep me in
[1:59:51] your
[1:59:51] prayers. We'll be shooting right back
[1:59:54] home this evening. And uh we just thank
[1:59:57] God for his grace and mercy.
[2:00:00] I just appreciate the young generation
[2:00:02] when they get married and they raising
[2:00:04] their kids. I know it. I don't taught
[2:00:06] them. I
[2:00:09] just All I can say, well,
[2:00:11] brother, at least you're still in the
[2:00:13] message. You can quote this one very
[2:00:15] well. I heard but now I
[2:00:21] see eye
[2:00:24] opener. That's why I love that I
[2:00:26] encourage so many people. Courtship
[2:00:30] that's where you learn just learn. Hey
[2:00:33] man, just learn. Pray learn. I said you
[2:00:37] know I told a young fell I said
[2:00:40] courtship. I said do you understand what
[2:00:42] that mean? I said it's a two-cllable
[2:00:46] word.
[2:00:49] Courtship. Yeah. I said in the beginning
[2:00:52] it just court. So what do you do in
[2:00:56] court? You make judgments. You make
[2:00:59] decisions, right? I said once you make
[2:01:02] your decision, if you feel that this is
[2:01:04] going to go on a little further, I said
[2:01:05] now you slide the ship to it. Now you
[2:01:08] can become two fellows in one ship.
[2:01:11] Yeah. I said, "Now, how can two walk
[2:01:14] except they be agreed?" I said, "You got
[2:01:15] to be agreed that this is of the Lord
[2:01:18] and then you go on from there. Go slow."
[2:01:21] Yeah. Oh, one more thing. Amen.
[2:01:26] A brother made a
[2:01:28] statement. This young man courting his
[2:01:32] daughter and uh they had a little
[2:01:36] disagreement and he just felt like this
[2:01:38] ain't going to work. crazy
[2:01:41] disagreement. The young man was telling
[2:01:43] him, "Brother, how much I care for your
[2:01:45] daughter and
[2:01:46] this." Then the brother called the young
[2:01:49] man. He said, "I want to say something
[2:01:51] to you." He said, "There was a man told
[2:01:55] the girl, "Whatever I got to do to get
[2:01:58] to you, I'll do it. I'll ride a train.
[2:02:02] I'll ride a bus. I'll ride a bicycle.
[2:02:05] I'll get in the car. whatever you need
[2:02:08] me to do, I'll come to you." And then he
[2:02:12] and he walking off, he said, "But I'll
[2:02:16] be here tomorrow if it don't rain."
[2:02:22] He said, "Brother, all of those
[2:02:24] promises,
[2:02:26] but then you're going to let a little
[2:02:27] rain stop you."
[2:02:31] Same thing in marriage. Are you going to
[2:02:33] let a little storm?
[2:02:36] Are you going to let a little sprinkle
[2:02:38] turn into a storm?
[2:02:41] No. Stay focused.
[2:02:43] I am his. He is mine. Stay focused. God,
[2:02:48] you gave it to him. You remember what
[2:02:49] brother Bannon said now? Brother Bon
[2:02:52] said, Adam didn't have a choice.
[2:02:56] That's why Adam was able to make that
[2:02:58] bold
[2:02:59] statement. the woman you gave me.
[2:03:05] You can't say that because that was your
[2:03:08] choice.
[2:03:10] Hello.
[2:03:11] The man Lord you gave me. No, that's the
[2:03:14] man you accepted.
[2:03:17] And brother, that's the woman you chose.
[2:03:20] So you can't blame it on God.
[2:03:22] Is that right? Adam had no choice.
[2:03:27] Adam didn't have no in-laws.
[2:03:32] You had a father.
[2:03:35] Are you with me? I think I better stop
[2:03:38] on that one. Let's just pray. Father, I
[2:03:41] just thank you for your
[2:03:43] word. I pray you just help us in our
[2:03:45] bodies. Just give us
[2:03:48] strength
[2:03:50] naturally. But as we preach to the body
[2:03:52] of Christ, I pray that they will
[2:03:55] strengthen in the word. We commit
[2:03:57] everything into thy hand. Lord, we're
[2:03:59] not
[2:04:02] comedians, but we just spoke simple
[2:04:06] things that has a deeper meaning than
[2:04:08] what it is on the surface. So, Father,
[2:04:11] we love you and we place everything into
[2:04:14] thy hands. In the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:04:17] we pray. Amen. God bless you.
[2:04:22] Amen. Amen. Let's stand.

[2:04:30] me. For the word is working mightily in
[2:04:36] me. No matter what the circumstance or
[2:04:40] what I feel or see, the word is working
[2:04:44] mightily in

[2:04:51] me.
[2:04:53] Oh, the word is working mightily in
[2:04:58] me. No matter what the circumstance,
[2:05:02] what I feel or see, the word is working
[2:05:06] mightily. Is it working in you? Oh, the
[2:05:10] word is working mightily in me. Praise
[2:05:14] God. The word is working mightily in me.
[2:05:20] Oh, no matter what the circumstance,
[2:05:23] what I feel or see, the word is working
[2:05:27] mightily in
[2:05:30] me. Amen. I'm so thankful for that word.
[2:05:33] Amen. That can come working mightily in
[2:05:35] us, giving us the word that we need to
[2:05:38] meet every circumstance. Thankful for
[2:05:40] brother Burley coming and being with us
[2:05:42] this morning. Let's just sing this.
[2:05:44] Children of the light, arise.
[2:05:47] Arise and take your place. It's by
[2:05:50] grace. It's by grace. It's by
[2:05:54] grace. If you're struggling in
[2:05:57] confusion, wondering why your heart
[2:06:00] seems low, take your hands off this old
[2:06:03] world, let it
[2:06:05] go. Oh, let it go. Let it be. It's not
[2:06:11] reality, but a shadow of a shadow of a
[2:06:16] shadow. Walk like sons and daughters of
[2:06:20] your father living here below. For
[2:06:23] you're not of this old world. Let it
[2:06:27] go. Oh children of the light.
[2:06:30] Arise. Rise. This is your day. Watch and
[2:06:34] pray. Watch and pray. Watch and pray.
[2:06:39] God restored the word, made clear his
[2:06:41] way that you may trust and know that
[2:06:44] you're not of this old room. Let it
[2:06:48] go. Oh, let it
[2:06:51] go. It's not reality, but a shadow of a
[2:06:56] shadow of a
[2:06:59] shadow. Walk like sons and daughters of
[2:07:02] your father, living here below. Oh,
[2:07:05] you're not of this old world, so let it
[2:07:09] go. Oh, let it go. Let it
[2:07:13] be. Not
[2:07:14] reality, but a shadow of a shadow of a
[2:07:20] shadow. Walk like sons and daughters of
[2:07:23] the
[2:07:25] father. Oh, you're not of this old
[2:07:28] world, so let it go.
