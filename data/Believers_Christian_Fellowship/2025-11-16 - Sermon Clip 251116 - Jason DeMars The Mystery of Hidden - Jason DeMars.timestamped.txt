[0:00] So there had to be a perfect lamb. There
[0:03] had to be a sinless sacrifice. Couldn't
[0:06] have any stain. You and I could not be
[0:08] in a redeemer on that level.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:11] &gt;&gt; We couldn't redeem the human race. It
[0:13] couldn't just be anyone. It had to be a
[0:14] specially
[0:16] &gt;&gt; designed man. [clears throat]
[0:18] &gt;&gt; Fully man. Totally man.
[0:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:22] &gt;&gt; Living and dwelling amongst men. But he
[0:24] had to be without fa fault, without
[0:26] spot. He couldn't be tainted by the
[0:28] original sin. Couldn't be tainted by
[0:31] even Mary, Mary's blood.
[0:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:35] &gt;&gt; And people will say, "But what about
[0:37] what about wasn't he fed by Mary?" And
[0:39] then they come up with fantastic
[0:40] explanations to say, "No, he wasn't fed.
[0:43] It was just supernatural."
[0:45] No. Study it a little bit and you'll
[0:47] understand none of the blood of the
[0:49] mother passes through the placenta into
[0:52] the baby.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[0:53] &gt;&gt; Never does.
[0:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[0:54] &gt;&gt; None of it. just the nutrients and the
[0:57] blood comes out of the baby and is
[0:58] filtered
[1:00] &gt;&gt; through the placenta and through the
[1:01] mother's liver.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; So none of the blood of Mary, she w she
[1:05] was his incubator.
[1:08] &gt;&gt; She was
[1:09] &gt;&gt; she was the woman that didn't fall that
[1:12] said yes to God.
[1:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16] &gt;&gt; And so she brought forth the redeemer,
[1:18] but it wasn't her blood because if her
[1:19] blood were there, well, number one, it
[1:21] would kill him. If if a mother's blood
[1:24] gets to the baby's blood, it it would
[1:26] kill him because they don't have this.
[1:28] Sometimes they don't have the same blood
[1:29] type.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; Because the blood, Brother Brandham says
[1:32] the blood comes from the father.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; And so it's he's not tainted by that
[1:39] blood. He's not tainted by the human
[1:41] race. And yet he is coming perfectly
[1:44] through the human race. Only God could
[1:46] put this together. Even I believe that
[1:48] even when he designed the woman at the
[1:51] beginning, he had in mind this is how my
[1:54] son is going to come and he cannot be
[1:56] tainted by the blood. So I'm going to
[1:58] make a placenta exactly like this and
[2:00] I'm going to make it to deal with the
[2:01] blood and the nutrients and everything
[2:03] because
[2:04] &gt;&gt; amen.
[2:05] &gt;&gt; My son will later be born and he can't
[2:07] have Mary's blood.
[2:09] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:10] There had to be a a redeemer because
[2:13] there had to be someone that came and
[2:15] took the book in his hand again. There
[2:18] had to be a second Adam.
[2:21] &gt;&gt; There had to be a new federal head of
[2:23] the human race
[2:25] &gt;&gt; that took control
[2:27] &gt;&gt; and said, "I I will take dominion. I
[2:30] will take authority. I will take the
[2:32] book.
[2:33] &gt;&gt; I will stand in your place. I will take
[2:37] &gt;&gt; the pain. I will take the suffering. I
[2:39] will take everything that you've done
[2:42] wrong, all the evil that you've done,
[2:45] &gt;&gt; all the wickedness, all the stain, all
[2:47] the blame. I will take it myself and I
[2:50] will bear it for you. And God will pour
[2:52] his wrath out on me.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; That the wrath that he the anger that he
[2:56] has towards you because of your sin,
[2:58] instead of pouring it out on you, he
[3:00] poured it out on Jesus Christ.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; And he took that for you. Why? Because
[3:05] he was going to redeem you. Amen.
[3:08] &gt;&gt; But he didn't redeem you
[3:10] &gt;&gt; at Calvary. He paid the price
[3:13] &gt;&gt; to redeem you at Calvary.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; He came in 1963
[3:18] &gt;&gt; to take the book
[3:21] &gt;&gt; to redeem you.
[3:24] Amen.
