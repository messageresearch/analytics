========================================
the longer i serve him he grows the longer i that i love him i just keep trusting my lord as i walk along i just is [Music] god bless you good to see everyone tonight we certainly have to trust god in a time like this don't we amen oh thank you musicians let's get the musicians at hand praise the lord all right we just thankful for the lord brother chad allowed us to be here this evening i uh told my church i need to get away for a little bit and i think i got it on i saw something pop up turn your mic on so i received your text message i replied by turning it on amen praise the lord but we're just thankful to be here and i'm saying uh silent told the church i'll just be away for a little while i just wanted to get away see some old friends and that's kind of relaxing to me get to see some old friends and kind of move around a little bit and uh so we just come by this way by god's grace his head and brother paul so to be with him a little bit and we praying for him and his family so i called by the chad i said like to come by he said sure that'll be fine so we're here by god's grace amen and uh you know me so we'll just go ahead and get to the word i don't have to introduce myself it's been like uh yeah it's been two about two years since we've been here but we're still pressing the battle you know you're going to be you're either going to press or be pushed amen i'd rather press amen so we just thank god for his grace and mercy i tell you i keep looking around i keep saying these young people i might change my subject when i see young people i just let me preach to them you know you just you be kind of drawn that way but i guess i'll stay with my subject here i actually had something else in my mind when i look around but praise the lord anyway so if we will i want to turn to uh galatians chapter four we read a verse of scripture and let you be seated galatians chapter four we want to go to verse one he said now i say that the heir as long as he is a child differs nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but it's on the tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father let's just pray dear lord we just thank you for your grace and mercy and we just ask that you we just come and speak to our hearts we just commit ourselves to you lord in the name of jesus christ we pray amen we may be seated i was um that's a little hooks there he goes i was uh i wanted to just minister on a few things tonight the lord help us how many of you love the lord you know god is doing so many wonderful things now and it could seem to be negative you're seeing a lot of negative things happening but yet god is doing wonderful things [Music] and uh i thank god for this message yeah i'm so thankful that uh i didn't have no denominational life all i ever known is the message and uh my wife i was just reading some things on the internet some of the reason why people left the message you know they can't shake me i just said well let me just read some of this stuff and uh when i began to read my wife what you doing i said i'm just reading some of this stuff my people say they left the word you know we say message but really when it comes to the end of the day they left christ [Applause] because christ is the message [Music] [Applause] so when i began to read it she said what you're reading that for i said just reading it over some things my wife said that she burley so i want to tell you something right now she said you get caught up into that mess so i just want you to know i'm gonna move back down to my ot i am not going to follow you she said i just want you to know that she said i'm not going to be like some of these other sisters follow their husband when they leave his word she says i'm not doing it she doesn't want you to know that and i said god bless you sister i think she got a revelation can we say praise the lord you know i didn't get mad i didn't be like i'm your head i'm your husband you're supposed to follow me i'm the you know you're my wife supposed to be submit you know that wouldn't even work it wouldn't she got a mind and a heart made up she said i just want you to know that i'm out god bless you that's the way it ought to be you know there's nothing i was talking to your pastor all the stuff that's going on it makes no difference what people can try to prove or say they can prove that's their business but if somebody can even show me something where brother brown has changed something i didn't say something right then lined up right that's fine because it's not going to change my opinion about him because brother brown was a man let me say man and it makes no difference they can try to prove or try to show you can't shake me you know even by the cloud anything it don't make no difference i'm not going to debate with nobody about that because signs and wonders and miracles is not what got me in the message it's the word amen and i have a revelation of the word and uh uh sometimes i i watch uh people want to you know you can't prove a prophet you can't vindicate a prophet god do it can we say amen here is a man speaking something even about our constellation being caught up he's speaking about something a year before it even happened if people could just look at the fact something did happen i mean he can't make something happen in the sky no man can do that they want to try to break it down i said but he spoken way over here and there it is so something happened we might can't explain it all but something happened see i don't get caught up into those things myself because you know it's just like uh back where i'm from in south carolina we got all kinds of different things going on they got this teaching called the hebrew israelites and it's most of us around black people about the hebrew israelite they're trying to prove who all this you know god was talking to me one time about the hebrew israelite and this this and that's a brother i some so thankful paul said that we shouldn't get caught up into all these genealogies it's just gender strife and i said this is what paul was talking about right here i said you know what i don't care i said there's nowhere where jesus there's nowhere god you can find in scripture where he wants us to know what he looks like that's he wants us to know who he is so it just kind of kept his little thoughts and then he start telling me well you know this man before jesus and just this for jesus and i'm just listening to and i just can't ask you a question as this man is you talking about that uh don't know all this before jesus i said is he your redeemer he said no i said is he your savior he said no i said come on man i said i want to talk about somebody that can do something for me i need redemption i needed salvation i said i don't i'm not going to get into all of this but you know all of these things are actually distractions and it makes you dig it makes you get into the word yourself so you'll be able to answer for yourself like timothy said you know and timothy started to show that self-approval but you know i can't explain everything but i believe and i just believe by having the right spirit god give me the understanding when i need the understanding that's just what i believe but you know brothers and sisters god is working on all of us molding and shaping us the way that he wants us he got all different types of ways that he do it god be doing something in our lives sometimes we don't catch it until it's over then we can look back and see it we don't see why we going through it so i want to talk about some of those things if the lord jesus christ would help us this evening and i want to talk about adoption but i titled the sermon ingredients for adoption it might sound a little comical but it's not comical it's just something that the way i know how to put it so i can express what's in my heart amen actually it was a friend of mine still is a friend of mine in new zealand made a statement about ingredients for adoption and that word always stuck to my head and and and i preached on this a couple times before but it just kind of come back upon my heart about adoption how many you believe we're in adoption time god is actually positioning every believer in the body of christ but you know god got a certain way he deal with me he might not deal with you in a certain way he would deal with you that he don't deal with me because each and every one of us is different just like having children you can have five children all of them got different characters about them and what you have to do deal with the child according to his character amen so one child might be like why daddy why you didn't talk to me like that why you didn't handle me like they said well cause you're different he's different from you so i deal with you according to where you're at and that's how god do with us he deal with us by our own character can we say amen but i want to just in dealing with adoption when we was reading here in the scripture in galatians uh uh it says that the heir as long as he is a child he differs nothing from a servant though he be lord of all and i really like this scripture because what where paul is laying this out which you know you can't preach on adoption in one night this is a big subject but i like what he was putting it showing that that the error even though everything actually belongs to him but until he come to a place of maturity the father just look at him just as a servant because he can't give him no responsibility until he get to a place not where he think he should be but to the place where the father want him to be because the scripture says that he differed no nothing from a servant though he be lord of all by him being the son he has rights to he's heir to it but he can't have the possession of it until his father determines it to be so so the scripture said but it's under tutors and governors until the time opponent of the father so it makes no different what the son can see what belongs to him that he's going to be a ruler over it one day that's fine but he can't have nothing until the father say now you can have it notice the scripture until the appointed time of the father it ain't when the son say i'm ready now i think i can handle this now give it to me now that ain't got nothing to do with it it's when the father says you're ready now see a lot of times we say lord i'm ready i'm ready i can handle it i can handle it he'll be like no you can't you say lord yes i can say no you can't because god knows he got to take you to another level where he wants you to be before he can give you responsibilities that he wants you to have that's our father can we say man you see brothers and sisters we we don't went past these times through the years even in ministry will administer might feel that he should have a certain recognition or a certain position or certain things he should be able to do should be able to preach that's childish hello you're going to maybe i know that sounds a little blunt but i'm just myself it actually is childish because children is always bickering at one another what they think they deserve that's what children do can we say amen so we have to grow up and not get into those things and go up above that it is what god wants it's his will it's his purpose this is his plan not our plan his plan what he wants to do amen and i believe when we get to those places in life we just surrender ourselves to him and say say lord what would you have your servant to do what do you want me to do i'm here amen but i want to just talk about a few things and uh turn with me to mark chapter 6 as i go here while you turn it to mark chapter 6 i want to read a quote the prophet god said in the message adoption he said you're not converted till you get the holy ghost that's what the scripture says jesus told peter ask anyone read your scriptures he was justified by believing on the lord jesus become a follower an apostle jesus gave him the keys to the kingdom john 17 17 he sanctified them give them power sit in the mouth cast out devils and things sanctified them sanctify them father through thy truth thy word is truth i sanctify myself because of them and brother banner began to say he said that's one of the sweetest words i ever heard father i sanctify myself for their sake he said did you know he had a right to have a home he was a human you know why he had a right to have a wife he was a man he had a right to all these things but he said father i sanctify myself for their sake i sanctify myself so brother branham is talking about some things that jesus had a right to have you know he knew he had a right to have a wife but he knew he was coming to get a bribe because he was a man but he said i sanctify myself for their sake he said i talked to a little preacher yesterday i got to preach for him in a few nights up here on the highway and i asked him about a certain thing he said yes brother branham but most of my people doesn't believe in that i mean uh i didn't get to tag all this quote but i can just kind of finish quoting it it was something about he was talking about a man some people in his church wouldn't believe in certain things and he knew that they didn't believe in it he said but i sanctify myself for them otherwise he laid aside his own life his own things that he would like to say and do to them for their purpose for their growth and then brother bannon began to talk about he said sanctify yourself one for another and then he began to talk about can you sanctify yourself for your neighbor when you begin to say those things sanctify yourself for your neighbor how many you know you remember christianity is living for others that's what christianity is but when he began to talk about those things it began to be a little striking to me how that we need to sanctify ourself for others and then he said it says jesus was training 12 men this is the scripture we're going to go to in a minute he said that through those 12 men he would take the gospel to the world he said for their sake i sanctify myself he said make yourself for your neighbor's sake for somebody else's sake don't use your liberty for a cloak say it all but sanctify yourself he said behave yourself in the neighborhood like a real christian ought to let your communications be if you meet your enemy sanctify yourself for his sake not knowing what you might do that isn't that interesting he talking about adoption but now you're talking about sanctifying yourself for somebody else's sake for your neighbor's sake in the message adoption you see a lot of times when we talk about adoption and i heard it preach through the year oh power we're going to speak this and we're going to do that all of that is firm but when you really look in the book message adoption he spends a lot about character and many don't like to preach about character but character is actually in part he said sanctify yourself for your neighbor like a real christian ought to for you even for your neighbor how many you know somebody's watching you all the time your neighbor is watching you all the time what you do you might not think so but they watching hey man you know what i'll just use this uh for my own self my own well let me just finish this quote he said now place in the sun first thing after the sun was in he became a son but we find out his behavior is what set him to adoption whether he behaved right or not now he's going back now even with behavior that's a big word his behavior amen is what set him to adoption we're going to deal with that just a little bit can we say praise the lord god got all kinds of things he can use to work on us he can even use your neighbor and sometimes your god can allow your neighbor to do something deliberately to you just to see how you're going to respond and sometimes we would treat other people all kind of ways and just oh you're being somebody in the church oh god bless you sister god bless you brother we ought to be able to tell the neighbor the same thing i forgive you god bless you you didn't mean that neighbor but we treat church people a different way and we treat people that's not in the message a different way that is not right actually wrong can we say praise the lord we expect one another to act a certain way but you know when somebody get out of character and then it sometimes shuffles us sometimes but really i want to show you god is actually doing things to work on you this is not right i'm going to tell you out of everything that is going on people leaving the message that's fine but what is your response to it what is your response god is watching that can we say praise the lord all right let's just go on in galatians mark chapter six but tell them you can just you told me take my liberty here go it might be a little long but praise the lord i'm gonna let it out in mark chapter six i want to go to verse 34. so jesus when he come out saw much people and moved was moved with compassion toward them but there was a sheep not having a shepherd and he began to teach them many things and when the day was now far spent his disciples came to him and said this is a desert place and now the time is far past send them away that they may go into the country round about and into the villages and buy themselves bread for they have nothing to eat verse 37 he said unto them give you them to eat and they say unto him shall we go and buy a hundred penny worth of bread and give them to eat now i want you to watch the scripture i love the scripture because i had read to you earlier i didn't finish the quote but brother branham said that jesus was training he said jesus was training twelve men that through these twelve men was to take the gospel to the world so i'm going he was referring back to matthew mark chapter 6 what we're reading how jesus actually training them you got to remember something when jesus trained them because he knew that when he leave he had to have the disciples there so that the ministry could continue but in this training here it's interesting to me in in the last couple of years i would say maybe two now i've been going through some things in my own life and it's in in in and it's good in one way in one way i didn't like it and and what it was uh god wasn't giving me sermons until i got to the pulpit sometimes or even 30 minutes before service start i could not find a sermon and i didn't like that at all i would literally be sitting in sunday morning i would be sitting there scratching my head about to cry saying god what i'm gonna do i said this is just i just can't this is just not right but you know one thing i started doing uh uh and all of that stress i got to a place i was just set in my office i'm talking about servant sometimes the song service could be going nothing happening but i'll just be sitting in my office but i always will appeal to one thing i would say lord one thing i know i have a gift that's for sure and i said and i also know those are your children they're out there and they're hungry and you have to feed them and you don't have to give me something for them and all and i would sometimes say you don't have to do nothing for me i said but those are your children you need to do something for them and i would just sit there and then sometimes maybe 10 minutes before i go to pull pit he start revealing i start scribbling things down just scribbling it down memory start coming back quote start coming back and and i said that's and it's wonderful services i don't like how it is because i don't like being nervous like that you you like to know what you're going to say but but i learned he knows what he wants to say to the people that's what i learned so i began to realize from this scripture right here jesus telling the disciples in their training he says right here they said send them away that they may go into the country round about and into the villages but verse 37 he answered and said unto them give them to eve now jesus knew they couldn't do that he knew that but he had to get them to see they couldn't do it see that's in the same thing in the ministry when we feel that we got it all laid out we got it all laid out we done perfected it that's us doing it but first thing god wants us to know even in the ministry you can't feed the people but i can feed them if you surrender to me i'll give you something to give to the people are you with me and they said it to him shall we go and buy 200 penny worth of bread give them to eat i just love this scripture they are realizing this is impossible we can't do that and i came to that place in my own life god i ain't got nothing i can't feed these people i can't do it and i'm sure god said that's exactly where i want you to be realizing you can't do it and i'm gonna tell you not just ministry god get us all into a place where you can get you to realize you can't do it brother branham said that when you when when you realize you can't do something you can't do it then god can do it see a lot of times we get so comfortable within ourselves i got this i can handle this no you thinking like that god gonna drop some things on you that let you realize you can't do it i'm a witness of that but i love this scripture jesus says in verse 38 he says unto them how many lungs have you have go and see and when they knew they said five and two fishes now jesus actually knew what do you have already right so i look at that scripture when i realize i can't feed the people he let me realize what do you have i said i got a gift that you gave me i do realize that but he says verse 39 he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass now jesus is giving letting them do what is possible now he gonna do the impossible but he let them do the possible so even in the ministry we have a something possible what we can do he told them you get them to sit down because he's getting ready to feed them you know that's what pastors and ministers can do when we come out realizing god don't give us something it's possible for brother chad your pastor to get you to sit down what do you think the pastor be doing when he comes out and he greet you start talking to you how was your day god bless you greetings that is getting you to sit down so now the word can come can we say man so it was possible for them to go out and get the people see that coming so you know that's why sometimes you might come to church stressed out and the pastor can feel it and start talking start talking about some testimony that god did what is that doing is calming your spirit so now you can begin to receive ministry let's see what he says here and they sat down and ranked by hundreds and by fifties and when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes he took up that looked up to heaven blessed and break the laws gave them to his disciples to set before them notice jesus the pattern that he did when he broke the fissures in the law he didn't give it to jesus didn't give it to the people he give it to the disciples then the disciples give it to the people that's the same as a minister he realized i can't do it god said what do you got i got a gift he's all right now i'm gonna give you a message and you're gonna use that gift now i want you to go give it to the people that's training the ministry now watch the scripture here he says let's just start to verse 42. they did all eat and were filled they took up 12 baskets full of the fragments and other fishes and they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand verse 45 straight where he constrained his disciples to get into the ship and to go to the other side until bethesda now listen what the scripture says while he sent away the people he didn't tell the disciple to send the people away he did it notice after they fed the people he said you go now i'ma send the people away that's the same as any minister after he doesn't preach gave the out that god put in his heart guess what now the holy spirit comes sends the people away your pastor can't go to home with you i can't go home with you but christ want to come himself and take what's being preached take that home with you and he start ministering to you by the holy spirit that's what god wants to do so we take up our fragments if i don't finish this service tonight i'll take it up and take it somewhere else and finish it but the holy spirit where he gonna speak to you tonight he will deal with you i didn't come to deal with you god wants to deal with you it's just a gift that he used to bless his people can we say praise the lord so whenever we want to put ourselves in a little category my little ministry my my no it don't work that way inside of god it's what god has permitted us to do the same thing is with our children the prophet god said god gave god let us borrow our children but they belong to god you are god's people that we've been honored to just minister to you are the bride of jesus christ can we say praise the lord all right let's keep going here ingredients for adoption behavior is what set him to adoption you know when things are happening i i myself don't sometimes just consider everything that's happening i start watching attitudes i start watching responses how people responding about what is happening that's what i really focus on a lot myself because i'ma tell you god is shaking everything anything that can be shook will be shaken but i want to show you how god is tuned in on each one of us as an individual and i pray that god would help me now i'm going to use something in in in in i'm not trying to be humorous even if i say something humorous that's what i'm not trying to be because you know i i want to this is serious are you with me but i want to use something to try to get across what i'm trying to say brother you pick that picture up for me oh okay can anybody tell me what that is you ain't got to be a rocket scientist what's that red velvet red velvet cake let's talk about that for a moment but what was that before it come a cake ingredients take the picture down brother i won't keep looking at it i just want you to see it you take it down there i'm going to use my wife to try to express what's in my heart let me let me just put this in too you know god bless you for chad you know a lot of times uh i kind of vanished a little bit it's i don't know let me tell y'all something about complexes let me just drop this in right here complexes is a terrible thing and a lot of people have them they know they have them but they do everything they can to convince themselves they don't have them oh yeah it's a terrible thing complexes could control you you know for a little while i used to get little messages come back to me people like where's burley williams and i said tell them i'm still in the message i'm just home so i'm fine i'm good but something happened to me i got i got criticized pretty bad and i started listening to the criticism and i did people start calling me a legalist oh you too hard you too rough and stuff like that that's ah but i pretending like it wasn't bothering me but i kept listening to it and then i started getting things back uh peter people were pretty much calling me shallow he said you're not deep in the word and things like that i ain't gonna worry about it but you know what i listened to it too much it didn't start bothering me a complex came and i got to a place i don't have to go preach nowhere i have a church i can stay right here i can preach i'm good i'm fine ain't nothing wrong with me that's what i'm saying but all along i was lying to myself complexes keep you out of fellowship because it's something you're dealing with within yourself but you know what happened i began to i was preaching at a place i'm still on my subject i was preaching at a place on the first and a guy come out to me after the service i had two services he said that was okay he's some kind of used to so and so preaching and so and so preaching and so and so preaching i said oh yeah yeah he pretty much is telling me you you you your way down here i went back to the pastor's house no i stayed at the church in between services that's all right i came back to the second service and man i preached i think i preached on the feast days it's just it was just revelation i mean i laid it out and laid it out people was happy and then when the service was over he came to me that's it but you know what i failed i literally preached to one man in the church because of what he said to me and i failed because of the complex but what helped me to get over it i come to realization it's not what people say about you is how you respond to what they say about you when you know who you are can't nobody shake you so i begin to look into my heart i know who i am i know why i preach i know what my reason i know what my motive i know what my objective is i said it makes no difference what people say about me but i tried to convince myself hey they know me i'm good i'm good i'm good no i wasn't oh no i let it pull me down and i let it direct my decisions that's what complexes can do but god permitted me to go through that to help my growth but until i come to reality i couldn't move no farther than that and the reality is i don't worry about what people think about me i'm concerned about what he thinks about me and that's what helps me to move can we say praise the lord you see that's a lot of problems with young children don't know how to handle complexes because growing up as a child running to other children children you know children are brutal little children can say something to another one they're just brutal but what is actually doing is breaking making scars and if that child it can't handle it properly it's going to start making them act towards what other children say about them then they're going to begin to look at themselves i'm nothing i'm ugly bars will be like look in the mirror i'm a wimp look at me look at that that's just complexes and you're letting them control you but i'm here to tell you you're fearfully and wonderfully made you are exactly how god wanted you to be and you don't have to worry about what nobody will say about you amen praise the lord because when you let them things get on you you're going to start dressing to try to please somebody else fixing your hair trying to please somebody else just to fit in with a certain group and that is wrong and that's going to drive you in the wrong direction i promise you it will so be thankful for what god has made you now i want to preach a youth meeting but let me just stay with this my wife my wife she's a excellent baker when i say excellent she's excellent and she can bake sometimes when she get a recipe book she might find a cake or something in there that she never did and uh and i could come into the house she can have that recipe book looking in it and you can tell she's in it she just be like i mean you can say something because she don't seen a cake that she want to make and she gonna and she has a vision now once she see the cake that she wants to make she actually already see the cake sitting on the table but it's not there so what she start doing she'll look at the book and start looking at the ingredients she'll go in the refrigerator start pulling things out see she got the she want that cake to come out just the way that she's seen it so she got to go by what the book says she can't change nothing and she can't add nothing she wanted to be exactly like the book says when she begins to get all of those ingredients and lay them on the table and sit them down and then get a big old bowl and and you can stand back and watch her man she'd be anointed you know when you're really into something you're annoying it when you do it can we say man how many of your brothers don't got anointed a time or two when you're cutting your grass at your house anybody some of you don't like cutting grass then you know when you cutting that grass when you're really in it you just you know then when you look back because it's your yard now when your son cut it he ain't doing it he just want to get it over with he just right so that's a different now you let them cut your head just oh you know but when you do it because you're anointed you're anointed he's annoyed but you know i began to watch my wife she get all these things there then she get the bowl she start throwing in salt she starts throwing in uh sugar and then you know to break her egg sitting it all inside of the bowl when you go look inside that bowl you see a bunch of ingredients sitting on the top now looking at them you can kind of tell which is which egg salt big chunk of butter and all that that's just sitting there but still there's no cake but she sees the cake then all of a sudden she get that bowl she stick that kitchenaid i think that's what you call him starts stirring it all up and as she's stirring it all up when she's finished stirring it if you look in the bowl now you can't tell which ingredient is which but yet every one of us is in there but still ain't no cake then also she started separating them pouring into the can is gonna be two layer cake three layer cake she just start doing all of that still it's no cake but with all the ingredients there everything stirred up nothing brings nothing together without heat she gotta stick it in the oven and when she sticks it in the oven the heat start causing all of those different ingredients that's been put in there to start forming so a cake can start coming together you see you and i we are god's bold well he throw ingredients in your life so he can bring out a son what's so interesting sometimes my wife have a cake in the oven and i don't know it and me and my son might come in the house and stomping our feet and she'll go stop and we just what she said there's a cake in the oven she said if you walk too hard it's gonna fall i said my goodness let me tell you when god don't put so many ingredients in your life you need to walk soft not hard so you won't fall he's doing some working see a lot of times god put all kind of ingredients in our life we just start spinning around oh what is going on what is going on you just gonna keep going down down down but you need to stop walk saw and pray because god is working on you are you with me so all the ingredients she put in there is for the purpose for a cake and then of course when the cake she done baked it she put it in it she separated let them cool off put all the whipped cream and all the stuff on top then we come in and say oh that's a beautiful cake but look what it went through before it got there so that is why you and i when we're talking about adoption god takes you through things to get you where he wants you to be and most of the times we miss it oh yeah we miss it before i go i want to go to genesis let me give you another example my neighbor it was this guy it was a church when i used to rent this house it was this uh a rent from a church and and and this guy come over my house one day he said he said hey mr win i'm retired and i got a lawnmower service he said i like to cut your grass and he was the one kind of instrumental to talk to the people that let me get the house and i told him i said uh i said well i got this big old boy here he cut the grass and i offended him but i wasn't trying to offend him i was just telling him it don't make no sense to me to pay you to cut my grass and i got this big old boy eating all these biscuits and stuff for free i mean come on he got to do something i mean that's kind of senseless isn't it he i didn't know i made him mad so what happened he cut it he cut the yards around my house and one day i was just standing standing and looked at my yard and he was cutting one of the neighbor's grass and there was some branches in their yard he started kicking them in my yard what is he doing you just start kicking them in my yard and you know how they make sure the exhaust is shooting right in your yard you know what i'm talking about some of you and i'm like what's wrong with this man they said wow so that day went by then another day come by and he was cutting the church grass and no paper in the church grass but he made sure that paper shot right over in my yard and i'm looking at him what's wrong with this guy and then to top it all off it was a beer can in the church grass he said he stopped and looked at the beer can then he said kicked it right in my yard that's it that's it i got on my phone i called the man over the church i said listen you need to talk to this guy i said he don't need to be doing that this is crazy he said okay i'll talk to him barely and then i hung up i went into my office about 20 minutes later i heard a knock at my door and it was that guy he said he said can you come out a minute i said sure can he said uh you didn't have to call the people on me i said yes i did just know you did i said yes i did i said man you you don't need to be doing what you're doing that's not right he said i helped you get this house i said i ain't even worrying about that man i said but still what you're doing is wrong and he said and i said nah i said what really got me when you kicked that beer can in my yard he said yeah i kicked it in there he said i thought it was yours i said no it's not mine he said i thought maybe you opened your door and it fell out your car i said sir i don't drink i said i never drank i said when i was a sinner i didn't drink i said i didn't do it and he said you never drink i said no he said he said i ain't never known a black man that don't drink he was a white guy when he said i said now you talking about fivefold ministry oh yeah he was gonna get one and i said i said sir that was a racial statement you just made you gonna make me see it he brought this tall imagine 67 about this tall could you imagine what was going on in my mind just one swing see the devil started anointing me just one oh just one i'm just looking and just analyzing it i did not know my daughter was up in the window was looking at me though that's what i didn't know until later he said you're gonna make me sad he said he's talking about black people he said you are the low down score of the earth i said i said listen man i said i'm gonna call you a pastor i don't care that's something to tell your whole church about it i don't care i'm out here arguing with this man but you know what i failed the test i let him get in my spirit i wasn't sanctifying myself for my neighbor god allowed that to happen just to see how i was going to respond i failed see so many little things god is doing in our lives we just overlook it but he's working on us all right since i got your attention come with me to genesis 37. i want to talk about the life of joseph for a moment to give a comparison every one of us got ingredients in our life god didn't put there and he didn't allow things to happen every one of us but you have to discern what they are and see is god doing this when i look at the life of joseph one of the first ingredients that god put in joseph's life it actually was his father it wasn't his brother's it was his father god had to have joseph's father do the things that he did to get things to start moving are you with me joseph brethren couldn't hate him if his father didn't start doing things first are you with me let's just watch the scripture genesis 3 37 verse 3. it's in the israel love joseph more than all his children that's pretty strong right there how many of you young people feel like mama loved the other your brother better go ahead and raise your hand i know you're here well daddy loves you better than me no he don't he loves us the same oh no he don't you know they can pick things up [Music] and it causes problems daddy's favorite mommy's favorite it causes problems you know what tickled me about david's life you can tell david and his brothers argued a lot because you remember when david went down there to see how they were doing and then they started they said we know why you come here and david said now what have i done now that goes to show you david been getting a lot of accusations upon him that's right it's sibling battles oh i'll tell you right now i know how those things go especially with my my three youngest when they're still with me that you know my my son my youngest my son it's kind of bad but it's nature most of the time a mother protects her son and then the father protects the daughter hello don't don't act like you innocent it's just nature and sometimes in the mother's eyes junior can't do nothing wrong and then the daughters be like you let him get away with that you won't let her get away with that she said he's fine he didn't do nothing and they like wow i must be blind with him that's right and then the daddy we talking to his daughter what's wrong with sweet what's wrong you be talking to and the boy do something what what you do that for boy what's wrong with you he like can't you talk to me like that because you're not a girl so it brings little favoritism and stuff in the family that's why be honest with you we have to balance those things to make sure our children know i love you all the same right but see now i got a little granddaughter now that's a problem that's a problem and she know how to get things out of me and it's hard to say no and now my daughter she's not looking at my grandma now she used to get all the attention now i got my granddaughter there my daughter like nah come on you 25 years old she's just seven years old that's no comparison but it is when that's daddy's little girl but now she see a intruder my granddaughter she just i can just see her coming man when she wants something she got i try not to look because i'm just going to say yeah you know you try to look away they come right up to you and don't say it loudly whispering papa what is it can i have dessert you sure can now my grandson was coming down papa come get some dessert you don't need no dessert you don't need no sweets boy that's wrong it's wrong she's an ingredient i'm saying that to say this by him expressing that he loved joseph more than all the rest of his brothers they see that but it had to be to catch the story brothers and sisters god needed joseph in egypt but he had to do things allow things to happen to get joseph there and he used his father and his brothers let me just show you something here are we all right tonight verse 4 when his brother saw that the father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peacefully in him if you notice the scripture they are watching joseph relationship in his father relationship and his bringing hate it had to let hate be generated to get joseph to egypt god focus at this time is not on joseph's brothers his focus is on joseph but he said i got to do things in this man's life to get him where i want him so when god is doing something to you and when he's allowing people to do things to you his focus is not on the people that's doing it to you his focus is actually on you and we like what are you talking to me like that why are you treating me like that what's going on what's wrong i ain't got nothing to you that's right god preventing it and there ain't nothing you can do to change it how many you don't even try to go to christian way try to talk to somebody have i done anything to you they say no why are you treating me like this i just want we're brother i just won't have peace with you so i'm i'm fine but but then you just walk off god got that person like that just to work on you and you don't know everything you don't know christian like and it seems like they just still don't like you god is permitting that to work on you let's go to verse 5. joseph didn't make that no better either joseph dreamed the dream told it to his brethren they hated him yet the more you see when god is permitting something to happen i don't care what you try to keep doing it it makes no difference what joseph did he could have cooked them something they still don't hate him he could have bought him something they still was going to hate him because god focus was on joseph verse 6 he said here i pray you this dream which i have dreamed y'all know the story i'm not going to just keep reading i'm just giving you some little clips here to get where i want to get to to show you how this is building up when joseph just telling the dreams all of these things it's just ingredients being put in the pot it's the only thing it is are you with me let's go to verse 18. when they saw him afar off even before he came near to them they conspired against him to slam you know this is a stone when joseph hadn't taught him they see him coming now they say we don't have to get rid of this guy all of these things friends i hope you're really catching what i'm saying all of these things they cannot change you know and i know that's that's you we ask ourselves how could a person treat somebody like this when you haven't done nothing to them all of these things is in god's program it goes right back to the scripture when god's gonna put it in the hearts of the other ones to hate the in the book of revelation when god put it in their heart you can't stop it can we say amen when god do something you can't stop even in jared the book of jeremiah when uh jeremiah telling them that nebuchadnezzar was coming down there he said surrender yourself to him and god told him your weapons ain't going to work your army ain't going to work you might as just surrender because god put it in their heart you can't change it that's just where it is verse 39 i'm sorry chapter 39 verse 7. just they just skipped they were going to skip a little bit you know when joseph got brother and they sold him we know the story i know y'all well talk when joseph got down in egypt you know actually when he got down in egypt things was going real good for him got a good job good retirement plan 401k joseph had it going on but you know what he still wasn't in the place where god needed them to be now he goes joseph just minding his business good job man everything i'm pretty sure probably his mind who need brothers so me that's all right you sold me but look what i got now i got a good job i don't need no brothers i'm good god said nope i got another ingredient i have designed to put in your life and it said in genesis 39 7 and it came to pass after these things that his masterwise cast their eyes upon joseph and she said lie with me the only thing that woman was was another ingredient god threw it in the pot because he need to keep pushing jose joseph character was not yet where god needed it his behavior is not yet what god needed then we find joseph down in prison are you with me let's go to verse 20. and joseph master took him and put him in the prison and placed where the king's prisoner was bound and he was there in prison but the lord was with joseph showed him mercy gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison now do you think at this time when joseph is in prison if you went down and told joseph god is with you you think joseph would have believed you god is with you joseph joseph like i'm in prison and you're telling me god with me yep he's with you joseph couldn't see it but god was right there so a lot of times when we get called into our emotional prisons a life cares and things of life god is still right there he's working on you i just love this story so much can be preached here but let's just keep it this way and if you notice verse 21 of verse 22 and the keeper of the prayers are committed to joseph and all the prisoners that was in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it you see now god is still working on joseph more than joseph life now you remember when they came to joseph and they told joseph they had a dream you don't see joseph tell it to metallica i'll interpret it i got it break it there i'll break it down for you nope he said god can interpret these things see joseph character is changing from his ability to what he think he could do what he can say to now he's relying on god see his character is changing god can give the interpretation god is now mellowing joseph down you remember the bible say you see a man hasting his word there's more hope for him than a more hope for food than him that's what the bible said a person that can oh i got to ask tell me i got i'll break it down for you what when a person say they got all that else oh my god i got a guy his character is not right god still have to keep working on him that's his immaturity of life but god is working keep going with me here now you know the story genesis 40 verse 8 they said unto him we have dream of dream there is no interpreter of it joseph said it to them do not interpretation belong to god tell me them i pray you see how his character is kind of being molded he's not trusting in his own ability he said god can do this see now we all have to come to that place even in our lives lord how do you want me to respond what do i need to do what do i need to say let me approach this thing the right way so it won't be damaged though now we're not relying on our flesh and i'ma promise you when you keep going through a bunch of failures like that failures and failures then god start you begin to realize it's nothing but failures then when you start maturing you'll actually become to a place you just know how to handle situations you ain't got to say god what should i do about it you'll become so much maturity you'll just know that's what god wants us to be to we would just no are you with me joshua he knew he needed more time to win the war son you stand over there joshua not only spoke to the son in the moon he actually told him where to go because he knew he needed that time look how mature he was you know joshua in the beginning was not that mature uh let me give you an example how many of you remember the story when the children of israel were down there dancing around that golden calf you know joseph i mean joshua and moses heard the same sound joshua's thought the enemy there overtaking them he said moses they being overtaken moses heard moses said don't sound like nobody being overtaken does that sound like a party to me think about it they both heard the same cry but got two different interpretations moses interpretation was right joshuas was wrong and it's based upon moses was more immature than joshua they heard the same cry but different interpretations you know what brothers and sisters that's a lesson to learn right there especially with a man a man get more irritated quicker than a woman whether we want to admit it not we get irritated well sometimes when we fail as brethren we can't unders we can't we don't discern if our wife is crying or complaining sometimes when your wife is talking to you about something you can say then you're gonna complain it again ah man it might not even be a complaint it's a cry and you look at it as a complaint you have to be able to deserve between bodies awful quiet amen praise the lord sometimes she might give you a call how you doing and you like fine she said oh i just call okay okay what is it didn't you just say nothing you failed to hear the cry that's right she just won't fellowship now she want to talk to you she missed you that's why she called you but can you tell me you could have told me this when i got home you failed that's right sister you missed it sometime husband's sitting in the chair you are by here look at you and look away you just you just oh come on kid he just come on come on come on come on come on y'all ready ready he just and you don't catch it he's crying he needs your attention but you're so locked in on the children you ain't seeing his knees discernment fail then he gets an attitude now you say something here what see in his mind he saw me over there you saw how i was looking at you he going over everything that he think you should have seen so now i ain't gonna pay you no attention and the bible said don't render evil for evil miss the cry and you know what makes it worse when you miss the cry of your wife when you miss that cry and then you know another sister need prayer then you go to your wife we need to pray for sister so-and-so she's really going through something she'd be like really and you can't see where i'm going and she'll pray but it won't be sincere she gonna pray with her help her lord she needs you we all need you children each blessing lord that's it see these little things right here that is so overlooked but it's it's what character is being developed it's in there now joseph i don't we don't have to read it you know the story you remember joseph told them remember me and actually hold on a minute i want to make sure i get it right i think it was the uh which one of them he told him to remember me and he actually forgot about joseph but god didn't forget about joseph there was no way in the world god could have forgot about joseph because he got joseph real close to where he want joseph to be and then we see let's just jump to genesis 41. i'm skipping a lot of stuff we understand when joseph came up out of the prison the bible said he shaved himself and then when he went to go stand before pharaoh joseph actually was fitting to get something he wasn't looking for and we understand by studying the message of the hour what pharaoh did to joseph when he put the rings on him in the robe and stuff he gave joseph an adoption ceremony that's what he gave joseph because now god got joseph close to where he wanted now he goes joseph walking around with all the authority you see when god when you even when you can be where you think you're supposed to be and you don't reach the level where you think you need to reach god still ain't finished because you just imagine when joseph was now pharaoh said you're next to me whatever joseph say you need something whatever joseph say could you just imagine all that power joseph got now now what if that woman was still alive that told that lie on joseph now she see joseph with pharaoh and why joseph coming down the chariot people sad y'all son and joseph sitting up there and then she's on the side yay tell sir and then he go i remember you he could have just said one word and they would have killed him but now he got power and character he wouldn't have bothered that woman because now god got joseph in power but now he's going to give him some more trials about his character this is so beautiful let's just keep this let me just show this to you i want to just read i just go to genesis 41 39 pharaoh said unto joseph for much as god has showed thee all this there is none so discreet and wise is thou art thou shalt be over my house according to the and according to thy word shall all my people be rude only in the throne would i be greater than thou here comes a man from the prison to the throne but look what it took to get him there pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set thee over the land of egypt pharaoh took off his reign from his hand put it on joseph's hand arrayed him investors of fine line and put a gold chain about his neck he made him the ride in the second chariot which he had they cried before he about the knee he made him ruler over all the land of egypt and pharaoh said unto joseph i am pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand a foot in all the land of egypt now you talking about a man in position for revenge he's in position for revenge chapter 45 we read this story a lot of course which depends on what thought that we're using right here now you know we can preach the feasts of the trumpets because that's what was happening joseph's brother-in-law trumpets was blowing to get them to come to joseph we can preach on the feast of the trumpet really easily right here but that's not my thought my thought is adoption and character to show you joseph passed the test now you remember when joseph brother was coming to him with that power joseph god he could have easily destroyed them but he didn't so now what god do to us a lot of times brothers is to put things in your hands and see what you're going to do with it and place it right in your hand joseph brethren was put in his hand you remember when brother branham and two kids acting up in church they was placed in his hands and god said what are you going to do he said forgive him he said that's what i wanted you to say but he could have got irritated and you know but he don't mind blasting stuff bob had it he just blasted but now they laid in his hand he said forgive him but in his case he was previously warned that the devil had a trap now you and i don't get spoken to like that the devil got a trap and be previously warned god let us go through things but now we have to come to a place in life where we can catch it that's right but the thing that i love about this whole story first genesis 45 4 joseph said unto his brethren come near to me i pray you and they come near he said i am joseph your brother whom you sowed in egypt now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourself that you sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life look look how he changed it don't you be angry god did this how many of us can say that when things have been done wrong we can just tell somebody it's okay brother god permitted this and it gets even better listen to what he says verse 8 he says so now it was not you that sent me hither but god and he has made me a father over pharaoh and lord over his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt now if you go up further pharaoh's told joseph i made you ruler but now joseph's saying no god made me rude pharaoh thought he did it he was just another ingredient to help joseph to get where he need to get to brother and sister i'll be honest with you when we can say it from our heart when things are going wrong but what we can really say from our heart god you're working on me you are doing this because now when joseph got into his place he was able to help the ones that sold him so when we get into our place he can use us to turn back around to help the ones that cause us the problems turn right back around now we can help him but first he got to work on us that's where it starts and it's painful but we got to learn praise god amen praise god can i go just a little bit more i want to turn to the book of proverbs and proverbs 29 remember jesus told his disciples i no longer call you servants i call you friends let me remember that scripture what jesus was doing he knowing that they're coming up in a higher level to his speech to them let them know you're not friends not servants then he tells us even in galatians paul said you're no longer servants your sons a servant and a son two different people see let me just explain that a servant attitude is totally different from a son's attitude a son attitude sees the responsibility that's what he sees i need to do this and not just to want this is a need and i need to do it that's the way sons look at things but servants look at things get somebody else to do it why me why i have to do it why can't somebody else do it see that's how servants think see that's why your children when i was children are growing up they got servant spirits hello i gotta do this again what can you tell her to do it why me i gotta do it he's just a servant but when that child starts growing and that sonship start coming in their life you'll start watching and do things for even his siblings let me get that for you let me do that for you because now he's seeing responsibility and it automatically starts happening you see servants can see something to need in the church they say why is somebody doing this why is somebody doing that why did that and they won't put up a finger to go do it that's a servant and then when somebody do it the service say they didn't even do it right see that's a servant but a son i see the need just let me do it if i'm able i can do it see it's different oh yeah it's very different this is going to bring us back even to ministry see even in ministry we as ministers can't have servant attitudes we've got to have sun attitudes let me just explain this in a minute let's go to proverbs 29 verse 17 correct thy son he shall give thee rest he shall get right into thy soul they say i shouldn't ain't got no rest right now no you gotta keep correcting me it eventually be rest and i'm gonna tell you what that rest would be your arm will be able to rest you don't have to spank him that much but then you have peace because by you correcting him when he begin to learn that'll be the less you have to correct him he said he's getting it or she's getting it but the bible said correct them we correct i think it's in the church eight book we don't punish we chastise not punished amen and like like the prophet said chastisement is you got the person betterment in view you're correcting them because you want them to be better that's the purpose it ain't be like come here you ah come here no no i need you to see something verse 18 where there is no vision the people perish but he that keep it the law is happy watch verse 19 a servant will not look at somebody and say will not be corrected by words for though he understand he will not answer other other words you can't take the word and correct them because they're not obedient to the word but they'll understand exactly what you're saying but they won't move you're taking the word you need to do can't you see what the words say they're like yeah yeah but you see no fruit in their lives that's right verse 20 see is thou a man that is hasty in his words this is what i was quoting earlier there is more hope of a fool than of him that's some strong language but it's bible language now this is the verse i love you know when you're speaking of sonship in the bible we know a servant can't be an heir a son is the air right that's why it says in the scripture he's different though he's a son but he different never nothing than a servant but only a son can be an heir see abraham knew that law you remember god promised him son and and gave him a promise but abraham said you gave me a promise but i have no son he's in this eleazar here i mean he he he ain't my son but he's like a son but he was eliezer was a servant but god said no out of your bowels shall be an heir see abraham knew that revelation so but when you look in scripture eliezer actually was like a son to abraham because of the way abraham trained him and watch the scripture verse 20 21 he that delicately bring up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the lent that's powerful other words i look at this even in ministry even sometimes in church you got people got servant attitudes but the ministry had to be able to take the word and use it so delicately and work with that individual until they become a son that's powerful but the word is what does it mean each one of us finding the will of god in our lives the ministers the ministry trusted in god for a message not just preaching it because it feels good to them or something they think no don't salt god and then the people are hungry then that word comes and it started molding us it started changing us then you can tell somebody say what happened to you as you could say the ministry changed me because the ministry is god's ministry not the man changed me that's how god operates and when you see people getting the pastor's spirit a lot of time because the way the pastor projected himself to the people and they get caught up into the man they're not getting caught up into christ i seen this time you got many people and because of immaturity in their life they get caught up into personalities and they're not getting caught up into the word praise the lord now i ain't saying nothing to this greek to ministry i'm telling you just how it's supposed to be and that takes training mistakes faults failures but learning from it that's what it takes and i'mma tell you i'm a good i'm a good learner i don't learn a lot and god makes sure i learn and it's very painful sometimes but when i see the outcome it's glorious because i want to see my church grow maybe not even in numbers but spiritually well i can be like paul i come among you save number jesus christ and him crucified when i come amongst you i don't want to see your sons and then this i want to see christ in your life that's what i want to see in my congregation and i want them to build it when they leave the service and god spoke to me god spoke to me i said god bless you you see even as a pastor i have to be able to discern when my church is complaining or crying i had to deserve anyone because i think here they go again hear all that man can you see i'm already stressed out this might be a cry in the congregation i had once i had a brother one time i had gotten going a little too much and he said but berlin said sir you know me and my wife were talking he said uh these brothers kind of need to leave you alone you're a pastor that wasn't a complaint that was a cry i caught it otherwise he was saying you've been going a little too much and we miss you and i had to catch it now if i didn't catch it i'd be like who do you think they don't control me i do what i want to do go where i want to go whenever i feel like it see i would have missed the whole thing even with our children you gotta catch it when they're complaining or crying most of the time we think they're complaining there you go with that again it could be going through something in school in life and they need to cry you need to hear the cry and get a child some attention can we say praise the lord but most of the times you know the bible tells us i think it's in the book of colossians or ephesians it talks about that you have the right to revenge disobedience when your obedience is for fear so it got to be something in us fulfilled too before we want to be correct disobedience all the time we got to be obedient to the word ourselves these simple little things right here i'm telling you is very very important we know the seals we know the trump we know it we can quote it by heart but let me tell you you got to become a part of our lives character have to go with what we're saying how many you know you know when you go into the grocery store you go to the fruit section how many of you ever heard a banana say i'm a banana how many of you ever heard of say hey look over here apple apple pear pear you don't hear nothing do you but you see fruit they don't have to speak for you to recognize what they are they see the light you see the fruit you see the life that's the same with christianity i don't have to go around prove nobody i'm in the message i don't have to do that i just let the message live out to me you know what i don't have to defend brother branham i don't have to defend the message all i got to do is let it live through me and let people see the life of what he preached what the word produces in our life they see christ that's it right there [Music] can we get a lot of hand [Applause] i'm closing i hope i want you to catch what i said i didn't say i'm fizzing the clothes i said i'm closing because when you say clothes then you keep going the enemy comes i thought he said he finally quit the game keep on going so i'm closing that mean we're getting there i am closing though see brothers and sisters all these little things that come in your life peter said think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened it's not strange god is permitting it i don't care how perfect you think you don't got it still ain't going to change trials god testified his own mouth job was perfect but it didn't stop job trial because god is constantly working on us and you know what when he the more he works on us the more we humble ourselves the more our children see they begin to see that even in our lives oh i can really get into something now i can just give you so many examples of things of family life you know brother chad they say i preach on family too much too but i love it because that's important family life is important and most people that say that their families all tore up cause they don't want to hear it one thing about this message it corrects a man it corrects a woman it corrects a child it corrects a church it corrects the ministry it corrects everything that's what this message is done a perfect message to create a perfect people or have a perfect bride for a perfect rapture this word will do that for this i'm just being honest with you and i'll be honest with you i'm actually being honest now i really feel like preaching but i'm not but i don't want you to what that's been said i want it to stick yes you young man be gentlemen be gentlemen i have to say this i'm so shocked i honestly thought everybody in the message preached courtship but i find out that's not true some young people don't even know what it is not even knowing it over here don't even know how to approach it that's right but i'ma just tell you like this young man or young girl if you want to if you want to learn anything from burly williams if you can't live a single life with christ an overcoming life by yourself with christ marriage is not going to help you [Applause] it's not going to help you you got to be able to live with him first and overcome your youthfulness before you enter into a relationship i'm just being honest with you don't get anxious don't get in a hurry settle yourself rooted and grounded get the baptism of the holy spirit yourself god will show you who is your husband who is your wife i believe that super i believe i believe that and you ain't even gonna tell nobody you just know she's mine he's gonna marry me you just know i then let god bring everything in place i asked some young men one time i said why do you want to get married i said can i ask you a question adam was lonely god said it's not good for man to be alone i said adam was lonely but he was not lonely for sex because it wasn't in his vocabulary he was lonely for companionship i said now why do you want to get married oh what go ahead most can't even answer brother that's sad i'ma tell you forget about all the and stuff that you hear about the message i'm here to tell you this word is perfect and it will make you a gentleman [Applause] can you say praise the lord and young men always keep this in mind when you're liking a man's daughter she is not your girl she is his girl she's not yours she become yours and when you say i do when it's all done now my girl hello until then that's daddy's girl with that being said you don't bypass a man to get to his daughter if she don't have a father you go to the pastor didn't talk to the mama and i don't want to be on the witcher that's what something now people just want to date they don't want courtship they want a date you see date is hidden courtship is open you know courtship is open where everybody know it's a beautiful thing when the pastor the parents don't talk to the pastor and saying about this young man and then the pastor talked and then the pastor say church i just want you to let you know we need to be praying for brothers and sisters so and so during a courtship now praying for the will of god is this is so openly amen now when you see churches over you see them talking to each other people like see when it's open now you say oh yeah they ain't caught and that don't mean you slip behind the building and talk either everything is open people just don't realize when you get married it's just not you and her it's two families coming together that's gonna cheer grandchildren that's right oh the beauty of courtship oh first chad i feel like preaching but i'm done musicians could come god bless you may god can we give god a big hand can we bow our hearts see anybody have need of prayer even though i know it's a little late but the altar is open but what i have noticed myself the lord had really helped me in my ministry sometimes it don't mean all the call because people sit right in their seat and they be dealing god be dealing with them and they respond father i'm thankful tonight i'm thankful for your word i'm thankful for your presence these things are so simple lord but it brings so much power and character in our lives when we understand that we're just clay you're the potter we're the clay and you know what you want us to be it's not what we want to be it's what you want us to be you know i just pray tonight i'm sure if i was the axis if god spoke to your heart raise your hand i'm sure oh god many hands will go up i'm sure of that but father i just want to pray for each and every one of us lord sometimes we just need a rededication in our lives from the pressures and things of the day month through the months weeks two weeks day by day depression and stress causes us to react sometimes some way we shouldn't that's why the prophet god preached a message letting off the pressure we have to know how to let off this pressure but lord you're doing things so simple you're mowing and working on us just like when the statue was moses was being built in the beginning i'm sure it was a lot of dust a lot of chunks a lot of noise a lot of hammering but the more and more he got closer to the finishing of the image it got quieter it got quieter and it came to a place of just sandpaper a little small sandpaper quieter quieter quieter because it seemed like the closer we get to the image the quieter things get because god you're working on the masterpiece you're working on your bride i just pray father that you would bless your people tonight i know you have in your word and i actually feel touch strength in my body touch my father-in-law be with my wife comfort her heart lord the things that she have to deal with and i pray for every individual here that might even be in the crossroad got a lot of things upon their mind questions i pray for them tonight lord that they were just trusting you and be patient for the answers to come not try to make knowing up but the answers will come oh god i thank you for your grace and mercy and we commit everything into thy hands in the name of jesus christ we pray [Music] [Music] amen lord let's all stand amen i appreciate god bringing our focus back to the little things you know we can be chasing after big things so much we're trampling over little things and we can be in little things in our life displeasing the lord all the time but you know what i don't want to displease the lord with anything with a word i spoke with a reaction to an incident i want to be pleasing to him amen and if he's allowing irritations to come maybe the irritation is just putting me in position or just moving something out of my life that's got to go and instead of getting irritated i want to change my attitude how many want to change your attitude i want to say god i surrender to this irritation just do what you're going to do in my life just mold me and make me change me god and then i i was i was today i took brother yatzik just comes to my mind i took brother yatzik and brother nathan to the air force museum down in dayton i want him to see that little pigeon that brother venom talked about they've got that same one he spoke about on the wings of a snow white dove is there in the case but when we got to the world war ii section i looked at the bombing of pearl harbor and i and i realized that famous quote from that japanese man when they bombed pearl harbor they thought they had crippled the the us navy and and he told them he had spent some time in the states had gone to school there or whatever he knew the american culture a little bit and he had seen the states and he says you've not done anything all you've done is wake a sleeping giant and you know before they bombed pearl harbor before they were success there was all kinds of little things that was missed a little warning here missed a little thing here was missed and a little something and it looks like a lot of people made a lot of mistakes you know what god's in it all right a lot of little mistakes a lot of somebody not on their post of duty somebody missed something amen but at the end of the day that looked like the devil had a great a great attack it looked like the devil did something but all he did was wake a sleeping giant and sometimes when trials comes in our life with a little mistake here and somebody said a little something here or we missed a little something there and all of a sudden everything comes crashing down and a big trial and it looks like something huge has happened in our life really all god's trying to do is wake up the sleeping giant because he wants his bride to have his characteristics on display not just to have his characteristics we have to have his characteristics but he wants them on display amen and he wants us to overcome and be overcomers and all of these things are ordained of god you believe that the footsteps of the righteous are order of the lord can you say like at the end of the day can you say like joseph said i'm in the place of god god has put me here you didn't do it god did it amen i want to look at life differently i say god keep dialing me into your program not my program your program and we got a good dose of that tonight a good lesson man let's just sing that song i surrender off we can sing that [Music] all [Applause] [Music] to jesus [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] is to jesus take me jesus [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is is [Music] [Applause] me me [Music] [Applause] is oh to jesus salvation [Music] [Music] praise the lord let's just bow our heads and pray heavenly father we love you lord jesus and we thank you god that you'll show us lord that all of these things lord that's happening in our lives are all things you're adding lord ingredients lord lord even the fiery heat lord is just to bring out the characteristics lord because you want it on display you're trying to mold something in our lives help us not to complain lord forgive us for complaining forgive us for grumbling lord and fussing god i pray to take all that out of us and help us lord to just submit to your hand and recognize your dealing with us lord open our eyes to recognize you're trying to put us in position and you're trying to get your life out of us lord and god that's our greatest desire is to manifest your life that's why your word came in this hour lord to perfect the bride that you might be on display in the bride god help us to move into that position day by day moment by moment trial by trial lesson by lesson let us move into full adoption lorn god may we display you on this earth correct us where we need corrected remind us where we need reminded change us where we need change lord but make us like you we love you god we surrender ourselves into your hand we trust you we know that all things that have happened are not mistakes but everything is moving us into that position and we thank you for it lord we pray that you take preeminence among us now and have your way as we part and go home lord and go to our various jobs the next day i pray that you just be with us and let us not forget the lessons learned may god have our eyes open to what you're doing in our lives as you're molding us we give ourselves into your hand and trust you in all that you're doing make us overcomers lord even of ourselves we trust in you god and give you first place take your bride safely lord bless this assembly bless each one each family we ask it in jesus christ's name lord we pray to bless brother burley he'll be away from
