[19:10] Philippians thank you musicians

[19:18] our family vacation this evening so I
[19:20] appreciate your prayers we'll be back
[19:22] Lord willing uh Saturday evening and
[19:25] plan to be back in the service on Sunday
[19:29] um
[19:29] but on for the Wednesday night service
[19:31] when I'm gone I've asked brother Ben
[19:33] siebo to take the service so he's going
[19:34] to be able to do that for us to be
[19:36] praying for him and pray for us and
[19:39] we'll pray for you amen also I got a
[19:42] message from Brother Emmanuel brother
[19:44] Emmanuel and brother Randy science made
[19:46] it safely to the Congo they were there
[19:48] they they had a long flight long journey
[19:51] they got there slept a few hours and
[19:53] woke up and right into service right
[19:55] into fellowship and right in the service
[19:56] and they have a busy weekend scheduled
[19:59] and a busy month so remember to keep
[20:01] them in prayer I asked him to send us
[20:03] updates so hopefully I'll be able to
[20:05] keep you updated as we go along
[20:08] amen let's look at Philippians chapter 2
[20:11] verse 5 now
[20:16] let this mind be in you which was also
[20:19] in Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[20:21] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[20:23] with God but made himself of no
[20:25] reputation and took upon him the form of
[20:28] a servant and was made in the likeness
[20:30] of men and being found in fashion as a
[20:33] man he humbled himself and became
[20:35] obedient unto death even the death of
[20:38] the Cross amen God bless you as you're
[20:41] seated keep the Bibles open we're going
[20:42] to go through the scripture amen and ask
[20:45] God to bless us as we look into his word
[20:47] amen I took for a subject humility for
[20:50] Redemption I don't even know if that's a
[20:52] subject we'll preach we just have to put
[20:54] a name somewhere amen but we've been
[20:56] talking about this subject of humility
[20:58] and Redemption and all of these things
[21:00] quite quite a while but the more we look
[21:02] into it the more it opens up the more we
[21:04] pay attention to it the more we realize
[21:06] that this is this is where we're at this
[21:08] is everything that that God is wanting
[21:11] to use us but what condition was me
[21:13] being to be used
[21:15] we know that God wants to do a work and
[21:17] he wants to do it in human flesh we know
[21:19] that we know that this end time that
[21:21] he's come but he's come in the form of
[21:22] his bride and he's here Amen to to
[21:25] display himself he's here that she amen
[21:28] will grow in His image and be so much
[21:30] like him she will be him amen and so but
[21:33] we we have to be in His image we have to
[21:36] be like him amen we can't just make
[21:38] claims and say that I'm the bride and
[21:40] Christ is in me but but she must grow
[21:43] into his very likeness amen for she has
[21:46] been predestinated to be conformed Into
[21:49] His Image praise the Lord and I'm so
[21:51] thankful for that
[21:52] so as we look at this I want to look at
[21:54] this scripture again and I want to look
[21:56] at this word humble where it says he
[21:58] humbled himself I think that's amazing
[22:00] he humbled himself it has to do with
[22:03] free moral agency has to do with the
[22:05] willingness it has to do with a choice
[22:08] he humbled himself and this word humbled
[22:11] uh in the Greek means the humble oneself
[22:14] to make low to bring low to level
[22:18] reduced to a plane
[22:20] and metaphorically this is definition 1B
[22:22] to bring into a humble condition reduced
[22:25] to meaner circumstances I.E to design a
[22:29] lower rank or place to to a base to be
[22:32] ranked below others who are honored or
[22:34] rewarded to Humble or abase Myself by
[22:37] Humble living this is what Jesus did to
[22:40] himself he humbled himself he brought
[22:43] himself low amen he brought himself down
[22:46] he brought himself in rank lower amen
[22:49] than others he brought himself to the
[22:51] lowest he brought himself level amen and
[22:54] and this is what God did this is what
[22:58] Christ did
[23:00] I want to look at this in Hebrews
[23:02] chapter 1 verse 1. I've got a lot of
[23:04] scriptures that I want to go through
[23:05] that's why I did a PowerPoint this
[23:07] morning so that I can keep going and we
[23:09] don't lose the time of flipping but just
[23:10] jot them down so that you'll have them
[23:12] and if you and if you did speed or sword
[23:15] drills and Sunday school class and
[23:17] you're fast you can keep up with me
[23:19] if not you can jot it down but I'm going
[23:21] to have it on the overhead
[23:22] Hebrews 1 1 God who at sun-dried times
[23:25] and in diverse manner spake in time
[23:27] passing to the fathers by the prophets
[23:30] hath in these last days spoken unto us
[23:32] by his son whom he hath appointed heir
[23:34] of All Things by whom also he made the
[23:36] world whom being the brightness of his
[23:39] glory and the express image of his
[23:41] person and upholding All Things by the
[23:43] word of his power when he had by himself
[23:45] purged our sins sat down on the right
[23:47] hand of the Majesty on high and so this
[23:51] is the description of Jesus but there's
[23:53] a phrase I want to pull out this word
[23:55] express image amen he who in verse 3
[23:58] says who being the brightness of his
[24:00] glory and the express image of his
[24:02] person and upholding All Things by the
[24:04] word of his power and I want to look at
[24:06] this Express image
[24:08] uh it means it can be used for an
[24:11] instrument used to engrave or carving or
[24:13] stamping like an imprint I'm going to
[24:16] get down to the definition there that I
[24:18] have highlighted in the orange it says
[24:20] the exact expression the image of any
[24:24] person or thing marked likeness precise
[24:27] reproduction in every respect
[24:30] this is Jesus Christ the express image
[24:33] of God why because God is a spirit
[24:37] is that right God is the spirit so he
[24:41] has to make a reflection of himself upon
[24:43] Earth and Jesus becomes that exact image
[24:47] in flesh
[24:49] he becomes the stamped image amen and
[24:52] he's reflecting the exact image of God
[24:55] Amen so that if you want to know what
[24:57] God is look at Jesus Christ because he
[24:59] is he is the express image of God
[25:02] amen he's he's not in the same form
[25:05] because then he would be spirit and we
[25:07] couldn't see him
[25:09] does that make sense that's why you come
[25:11] into flesh amen amen and out from God
[25:14] come the word and he called that son and
[25:16] he took the word amen and he was in
[25:18] different forms coming down through but
[25:19] he finally came in flesh born of a woman
[25:22] and he was the express image the exact
[25:24] replica the perfect likeness of God
[25:27] himself
[25:28] this is what makes him God on Earth
[25:31] because he's the exact replica the exact
[25:34] uh a reflection and the the life of God
[25:37] the spirit of God dwelt inside him and
[25:39] fullness
[25:41] he says hear that Colossians 2 9 for in
[25:44] him dwelleth all the fullness of the
[25:46] godhead bodily
[25:48] so that means if I want to know what God
[25:51] is like I can look to Jesus Christ he's
[25:53] the expressed image
[25:56] he's the fullness of the godhead bodily
[25:58] amen and another scripture in second
[26:00] Corinthians 4 6 it says for God who
[26:03] commanded the light to shine out of
[26:04] Darkness has shined in our hearts to
[26:06] give the light of the knowledge of the
[26:08] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[26:11] so the the glory of God is seen in the
[26:13] face of Jesus Christ and this word face
[26:16] doesn't just mean this part of your body
[26:18] this word face in the Bible means your
[26:21] person your very person
[26:23] and and if I want to see the glory of
[26:25] God I can see it in the person of Jesus
[26:27] Christ
[26:28] he's the expressed image expressed image
[26:31] of God in whom the fullness of the God
[26:33] had dwelt bodily amen and in his face in
[26:37] the person I can see the uh I have the
[26:39] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[26:41] face of Jesus Christ is that right
[26:44] so when we look at Jesus and we look at
[26:47] his life and we look at what he did
[26:48] what's he expressing to us he's
[26:50] expressing the very character and nature
[26:53] of God
[26:54] amen so so we find when we come back and
[26:58] look at at Philippians 2 5 amen this is
[27:03] the expression of God the way God is
[27:05] expressing himself on Earth amen and and
[27:08] God has the capacity to become humble
[27:13] such a strange thought amen he who
[27:16] existed before anything else existed he
[27:18] who existed of himself and by himself
[27:21] without any help from anywhere and
[27:23] everything that was made both in heaven
[27:25] and earth is made from him and by him
[27:27] amen they they they they were made and
[27:30] they exist and he holds them where they
[27:32] are he is above everything he's the
[27:35] creator of everything
[27:37] but yet he's able to come down
[27:40] he's able to come low he's able to be
[27:43] humble
[27:44] this this I find fascinating and Jesus
[27:47] was expressing the glory of God Amen the
[27:50] knowledge of the glory of God and his
[27:51] very person he was expressing characters
[27:53] of God
[27:55] hey many many men
[27:58] so Philippians 2 5 sound now we know he
[28:02] he made himself of no reputation took
[28:04] upon him in the form of a servant made
[28:06] in the likeness of man and and being
[28:08] found in fashion as a man he humbled
[28:10] himself and became obedient to death
[28:12] even the death of the Cross that's all
[28:15] describing Jesus who's the express image
[28:17] of God right
[28:18] but now he comes in verse the beginning
[28:20] he says let this mind be in you
[28:24] now all of a sudden now you are to
[28:27] become another reflection amen he was
[28:30] the very reflection of God now you're to
[28:32] become the reflection of Christ
[28:35] as Christ dwells in you and so he he he
[28:38] was the perfect image and reflection and
[28:41] Declaration of of the Unseen God became
[28:44] visible became tangible in Jesus Christ
[28:46] amen and now Christ is becoming visible
[28:49] intangible In You and I
[28:52] but we have to let this mind be in US
[28:55] amen we have to think this way we have
[28:58] to conduct ourselves this way this is
[29:01] the plan this is the path amen so when I
[29:04] begin to look at this uh a certain I say
[29:08] understanding begin to grow for me
[29:11] amen and it was this that in order to
[29:16] manifest Christ
[29:18] the first thing I need to do is make
[29:19] myself of no reputation
[29:24] that sounds easy I mean that rolls right
[29:25] off the tongue
[29:27] but that's one of the hardest things for
[29:29] a human being to do
[29:33] it is so hard in this word that says
[29:37] make himself of no reputation this word
[29:39] reputation means actually means nothing
[29:43] it means be void to be empty to be
[29:46] nothing he made himself void empty
[29:49] nothing he made himself absolutely
[29:51] nothing
[29:54] and took on him the form of a servant
[29:57] so if I'm going to follow after Christ
[30:02] I need to make myself I'm supposed to
[30:04] have this mind
[30:06] that was in him this is the mind I'm
[30:08] supposed to have
[30:10] which who being in the form of God
[30:12] thought it not Robbie to be equal with
[30:13] God Amen we know that this is part of
[30:15] the mindset understanding where we came
[30:18] from understanding that where we
[30:20] originated understanding that we were
[30:22] part of God and with God before the
[30:23] foundation of the world that's part of
[30:25] this understanding
[30:27] but being that that's part of the
[30:29] understanding it's almost like it's
[30:31] foundational for the next part Because
[30:33] unless you get the first part you'll
[30:35] never be able to come to the second part
[30:36] because only those that are part of God
[30:39] can take the nature of God and make
[30:40] themselves of no reputation because
[30:42] Lucifer can't do that
[30:45] humans of themselves can't do that amen
[30:48] because that whole nature of Lucifer got
[30:50] injected in humanity at the fall he
[30:52] found through the serpent a way that he
[30:54] can inject himself into the human race
[30:56] and with that he brought Pride with that
[30:58] he brought arrogancy with that he
[31:00] brought all of these uh other things
[31:02] self-preservation and all of these
[31:04] things was entered into Humanity right
[31:06] there amen and without without a
[31:09] revelation that I was before I came in
[31:12] Fallen flesh I was
[31:15] I was part of God I was one of his
[31:17] attributes part of his thinking he had a
[31:19] design and desire to express me in this
[31:21] life now I've fallen into hybrid
[31:23] condition but this hybrid condition will
[31:25] not Define me because my existence was
[31:28] before the hybrid condition
[31:30] so I will not let the Fallen nature
[31:33] Define who I am I will not let the flesh
[31:35] control me amen because this part of me
[31:38] that's been awakened by the baptism of
[31:40] the Holy Ghost has been quicker than
[31:41] life that part was somewhere before it
[31:44] came into this vessel
[31:48] and it was part
[31:50] of this God this divine nature this
[31:53] Supreme Being
[31:55] so there it carries with it
[31:57] characteristics
[31:59] from God
[32:01] so you can see how if we're going to let
[32:03] this mind be in US
[32:06] which was also in Christ Jesus
[32:08] you have to understand where you came
[32:10] from
[32:11] you have to understand who you are and
[32:15] also how you got into this condition
[32:20] and then
[32:23] you can make yourself of no reputation
[32:27] and then take on the form of a servant
[32:33] and then humble ourselves
[32:37] and then be obedient
[32:39] even unto death
[32:41] this is what we're supposed this is the
[32:43] mind that's supposed to be in US
[32:47] so we have so much fun talking about the
[32:49] first half
[32:51] that this mind being you which was in
[32:53] Christ who being in the form of God
[32:55] thought it not Robert to be equal with
[32:56] God but made him what this the first
[32:59] part was great I want this mind to be in
[33:02] me which also in Christ that I came from
[33:04] God that I was part of God and all of
[33:06] those that's wonderful amen but that's
[33:09] not the end of what Paul is trying to
[33:10] express amen if that's true about you
[33:13] amen then then if you're going to
[33:15] express God the way Christ expressed God
[33:17] then you better make of yourself of no
[33:19] reputation
[33:21] take on the form of a servant
[33:25] praise God
[33:27] and humble ourselves
[33:29] and be obedient
[33:32] praise God
[33:33] this is why brother bear says the path
[33:35] Up Is Down
[33:36] it's so clear to me in the scriptures
[33:38] and it keeps exploding everywhere I look
[33:41] he says second Corinthians 8 9 says for
[33:45] you know the grace of our Lord Jesus
[33:46] Christ that though he was rich yet for
[33:50] your sakes he became poor that ether is
[33:52] poverty might be rich
[33:55] this is this is the action that Jesus
[33:58] Christ took
[33:59] amen and if that's the path he walked
[34:02] what path should I walk
[34:05] now I thought of this humility for
[34:08] Redemption because the the path for our
[34:11] Redemption amen came through humility
[34:14] Jesus humbled himself made himself no
[34:17] reputation took on the form of a servant
[34:19] humbled himself and was obedient amen
[34:21] and what did he do that for to bring
[34:23] about Redemption and you and I how am I
[34:25] going to be a partaker of redemption if
[34:27] I come through pride and arrogancy and
[34:30] selfishness and self-will and all of
[34:32] these things and then also how am I
[34:34] going to perpetuate redemption or bring
[34:36] Redemption to anyone else in the world
[34:37] Amen if I don't come through the same
[34:40] characteristics
[34:41] because we want Redemption for our
[34:43] family we want Redemption for the last
[34:45] predestinated Soul we want Redemption
[34:47] for the world we want see we're not just
[34:50] here to get saved amen but but God has a
[34:52] purpose in our lives and we're here to
[34:54] manifest Christ and we're also I believe
[34:56] with all my heart that I'm also a door
[35:00] I'm also adore to Salvation I'm also a
[35:03] lighthouse that can point the way I'm
[35:04] also a gate that somebody can enter in
[35:07] by and find them their way to Christ why
[35:09] because I know the way because Within Me
[35:11] is the word amen Christ dwells within
[35:14] so I want to be a door I don't want to
[35:17] be a barbed wire fence
[35:22] I don't want to be amen an obstacle to
[35:25] Redemption I want to be a door to
[35:27] Redemption
[35:30] but if I am going to be an instrument
[35:32] that God will use for Redemption of
[35:34] loved ones Redemption of others that are
[35:36] lost if I'm going to be that instrument
[35:37] amen then I'm going to have to follow
[35:40] the same pattern because if Christ
[35:41] brought Redemption through humility
[35:44] through surrender through making himself
[35:46] low then how am I going to perpetuate
[35:49] Redemption through Pride arrogancy
[35:51] selfishness
[35:53] it must come to the same line through
[35:55] the same characteristics
[35:58] praise God
[36:00] amen
[36:03] so
[36:05] this is the grace of our Lord Jesus
[36:07] Christ
[36:09] he was rich
[36:12] yet for our sakes he became poor
[36:15] that we through his poverty might be
[36:18] rich
[36:21] you know
[36:24] I love that
[36:26] but can I replicate that
[36:31] can I
[36:33] can I replicate that can I lower myself
[36:36] for somebody else's salvation
[36:39] can I be of no reputation and humble and
[36:42] a servant
[36:43] so that somebody else can find
[36:45] Redemption
[36:47] I love that he did that
[36:49] that's beautiful for me and that that
[36:52] has changed my life but can I perpetuate
[36:55] it
[36:56] can I manifest it
[37:00] Isaiah 53 2 he says for he shall grow up
[37:03] before him as a tender plant and as a
[37:06] root out of dry ground he hath no form
[37:08] nor coming this and we wish when we
[37:11] shall see him there is no beauty that we
[37:13] should desire him he is despised and
[37:16] rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and
[37:18] acquainted with grief and we hid as it
[37:20] were our faces from him he was despised
[37:23] and we esteemed him not
[37:25] and this is the path he chose
[37:28] this is by his choosing this is the path
[37:31] he chose and he stayed humble and he
[37:33] stayed a servant and he stayed
[37:35] submissive to the whole plan of God Amen
[37:38] and why did he do that for he did it for
[37:40] me
[37:42] amen and and now all of a sudden can I
[37:45] have enough love in my heart for Souls
[37:49] that I can follow his pattern can I
[37:52] really make myself of no reputation can
[37:54] I really Paul says I've become all
[37:56] things to all men that I might win some
[38:00] amen
[38:02] hey praise God
[38:05] and the message humble thyself but the
[38:07] man says look at Jesus nothing but one
[38:10] bundle of Love see he was God manifested
[38:13] he God expressed himself through him no
[38:16] wonder Miracles and things happen his
[38:17] humble life in consecrated life to come
[38:20] from being God to be a man here on Earth
[38:22] to express God through himself that's
[38:25] what made him what he was I've always
[38:27] said what made Jesus God to me was the
[38:30] way he humbled himself
[38:32] he was so great and yet he could be so
[38:34] small
[38:36] what this is what the prophet said what
[38:39] made Jesus God to me was that he could
[38:41] humble himself
[38:42] amen that we we can see
[38:45] a lot of people can do a lot of things
[38:48] amen but this this true humility is the
[38:52] nature of God
[38:54] so he God was expressing himself through
[38:58] Christ and so this was Christ but what
[39:00] is our what is our objective in this day
[39:02] amen to get saved live a happy life go
[39:05] in the Rapture but really we are to
[39:07] become his in his very image we're to
[39:09] become an expression of him on Earth
[39:11] through the bride
[39:13] so we must reflect his life we must
[39:15] reflect his nature we must reflect his
[39:17] glory and this is this is what made him
[39:20] gone to the prophet is that he could
[39:22] humble himself
[39:24] and maybe what would make us bride is
[39:27] that we can follow the same pattern
[39:30] amen maybe what we're we're looking for
[39:33] is the character I mean everybody wants
[39:36] to have power everybody wants to have
[39:37] what they call power
[39:40] everybody wants to have manifestations
[39:41] because if I have if I have powerful
[39:45] manifestations amen they can be a
[39:48] Vindication of me
[39:51] right that you can everybody wants to be
[39:54] proved everybody wants to be Vindicated
[39:57] everybody wants to be respected
[40:00] everybody wants to be held in honor
[40:01] everybody want you know this is just
[40:04] human nature
[40:06] that's just the normal basics of human
[40:08] nature but Jesus was able to go amen he
[40:12] was able to lower himself in such a way
[40:14] that he would be accused of everything
[40:17] he would be accused of being a devil he
[40:19] would be I mean even when he manifests
[40:22] the sign of the Messiah and he manifests
[40:24] amen the the things that that that that
[40:26] that declared that God was with him amen
[40:29] they attributed to the works of a devil
[40:31] not to God
[40:32] because
[40:34] and he was able to stay humble
[40:36] stay submissive make himself of no
[40:39] reputation
[40:42] amen
[40:44] praise God
[40:46] James 4 comes and says humble yourselves
[40:49] in the sight of the Lord
[40:51] and he shall lift you up
[40:55] and first Peter 5 5 says likewise you
[40:58] younger submit yourselves unto the Elder
[41:00] yay all of you be subject one to another
[41:02] and be clothed with humility for God
[41:04] resisted the proud and giveth grace to
[41:06] the humble humble yourselves therefore
[41:08] under the mighty hand of God that he may
[41:10] exalt you in due time
[41:12] this is always the path this is the only
[41:15] way that this will work praise God
[41:18] so I just want to keep moving there's
[41:20] some things that I want to get to I want
[41:21] to keep moving quickly and under
[41:23] influence he says see the
[41:25] the one over his feet government
[41:27] humility this is the Angels the
[41:28] cherubims that are in the presence of
[41:31] almighty God with the six wings two they
[41:33] cover their face two they cover their
[41:35] feet and two they fly with and he says
[41:37] that one was over the feet covered
[41:39] humility watch this servant now before
[41:41] God his face covered in reverence his
[41:43] feet covered in humility yes very
[41:46] conscious be very conscious of your
[41:47] littleness
[41:49] all of us is trying to be some big
[41:51] somebody I'm Dr so and so the great
[41:53] so-and-so of so and so you are nothing
[41:55] that's right you're nothing if you want
[41:58] to know how great you are put your
[42:00] finger in a pool of water and pull it
[42:01] out and find the hole where you put it
[42:03] in see there is nothing there and that's
[42:06] what we are God can do without us but we
[42:08] can't do without him who who are you see
[42:12] being conscious of how little you are
[42:14] the Way Up Is Down he that humbles
[42:17] himself shall be exalted he that exalt
[42:20] himself shall be abased
[42:22] amen this is a principle that holds true
[42:24] in life it is held true in my life is
[42:27] certainly held true in my life and I
[42:29] believe it always will amen he who
[42:31] humbles himself then God can lift them
[42:34] up but he who exalts himself shall be
[42:36] abased
[42:38] amen so the Way Up Is Down in Luke 14
[42:41] says for whosoever exalted himself shall
[42:43] be a base this is Jesus speaking and he
[42:46] that humbleth himself shall be exalted
[42:48] so this is a pattern with God and God
[42:52] was able to Humble himself Christ came
[42:53] and made himself with no reputation this
[42:55] is the pattern with God but when we see
[42:57] Lucifer over in Isaiah 14 he says how
[43:00] art thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer
[43:02] son of the morning how art thou cut down
[43:04] to the ground which did weaken the
[43:06] Nations for thou has said in thine heart
[43:08] I will Ascend unto Heaven I will exalt
[43:11] my throne above the stars of God I will
[43:13] sit also upon the Mount of congregation
[43:15] in the size of the north I will descend
[43:18] above the heights of the clouds I will
[43:20] be like the most high
[43:22] yet thou shall be brought down to Hell
[43:25] to the sides of the pit that's what
[43:28] Jesus said if you exalt yourself you'll
[43:29] be abased he's exalted himself he's
[43:32] going to be brought down to Hell to the
[43:34] size of the pit
[43:35] then look what he says I will and all of
[43:38] his eye Wills have no humility
[43:40] whatsoever
[43:42] I will set upon the Mount of the
[43:44] congregation first he says I will Ascend
[43:47] them to heaven I will exalt my throne
[43:50] above the stars of God
[43:52] I will sit on the Mount of the
[43:53] congregation I will descend above the
[43:56] heights of the clouds I will be like the
[43:57] most high God all of his eyes is
[44:00] exaltation I will lift up I will be
[44:02] above I will be great I I
[44:06] but when Jesus come to the place where
[44:09] he was saying I amen I will go down I
[44:13] will become nothing I will lure myself I
[44:16] will be a servant I will die
[44:20] you see the contrasting Natures we have
[44:22] between God and Lucifer I will become
[44:25] nothing I will get spit on I will be
[44:28] mocked I will be made fun I will not
[44:30] fight back
[44:32] I will subject myself to human
[44:34] governments I will subject myself to
[44:37] torture
[44:39] the Way Up Is Down
[44:41] amen so God came down and he lowered
[44:45] himself Lucifer was trying to exalt
[44:47] himself but God was as was coming down
[44:50] and lowering himself and the question is
[44:52] why was he lowering himself that that's
[44:55] a fantastic question amen and that comes
[44:58] to do with Redemption he was lowering
[45:00] himself so that he could lift me up
[45:03] he came down amen not just to come down
[45:06] but he came down so that he could come
[45:09] under amen meet his children so that he
[45:12] could lift his children into his
[45:13] presence he came down and humbled
[45:15] himself for for for Redemption he came
[45:18] down and lowered himself so that he
[45:19] could lift me up amen he didn't come for
[45:22] himself he came for others
[45:26] Lucifer was only interested in himself
[45:29] I will I will but when God said I will I
[45:32] will go down I will humble myself I will
[45:35] take on the form of a man I will become
[45:37] a servant I will kneel down I will
[45:40] undress myself and kneel down and wash
[45:41] their feet amen I will lower myself for
[45:44] what purpose so that he can come
[45:46] underneath and lift us up
[45:50] now the question is can I do that for my
[45:52] neighbor
[45:53] can I do that for my loved one can I or
[45:56] do I stand on the on the perch
[45:59] of the Bride
[46:00] and say you come up here and
[46:04] yeah you can be like me
[46:07] someday
[46:09] my goodness God never dictates that he
[46:11] never stays above and he never speaks
[46:13] condescending and when I was speaking to
[46:15] a brother the other day and I said it's
[46:17] amazing God has the ability to
[46:20] condescend
[46:21] Lucifer can't amen he can't condescend
[46:24] but God can condescend but God can
[46:27] condescend without being condescending
[46:32] he can come down amen and he can Jesus
[46:35] can walk among them the greatest of them
[46:37] all amen by him were the world's made
[46:39] amen without him nothing was made that
[46:41] was made then here that word was taken
[46:43] in the form of a flesh and he was
[46:45] walking around the creator of the earth
[46:47] amen and everything was sustained by him
[46:49] amen he was walking around they were
[46:51] rejected and he didn't set the record
[46:53] straight they were stepping on him and
[46:55] he never Rose above them he stayed in a
[46:57] condescending and condescension but he
[47:00] never became condescending he never
[47:02] spoke down to them he never spoke
[47:04] disrespectful to them even when he was
[47:06] before the council he never spoke
[47:08] condescending
[47:10] he honored them
[47:12] even the Pilate
[47:16] you know we've said this before when
[47:18] Jesus was in the courtroom that day amen
[47:21] he was the one who knew everything
[47:24] when he was in the trial that that mock
[47:26] trial at Cai emphasis or ananias
[47:29] wherever he was when they brought
[47:30] together the trial and they brought
[47:31] together the witnesses amen Jesus could
[47:34] have rose up and he could have told them
[47:36] what they had for breakfast and what
[47:37] this one said to that one and how much
[47:39] money you gave to this one and over here
[47:41] on this street you said this and your
[47:43] wife told you not but then you took the
[47:45] money and you came here and he could
[47:47] have exposed the whole thing he could
[47:49] have went down the line to the Sanhedrin
[47:51] and all 70 of those Elders he could have
[47:53] exposed their lives until every one of
[47:54] them was ashamed and wouldn't even stay
[47:56] in that room anymore
[47:58] he had the capability he was able he
[48:01] could vanish from their presence he did
[48:02] it before and passed through a crowd
[48:04] unseen to escape but here he come and he
[48:07] made himself of no reputation they would
[48:09] mock him till lies about him and he
[48:11] wouldn't say a word amen because he was
[48:14] doing that for you and I
[48:16] he wasn't defending himself he wasn't
[48:18] protecting his reputation he had so much
[48:21] reputation he didn't need to defend his
[48:23] reputation
[48:26] because he knew who he was
[48:28] he knew why he was there and he didn't
[48:31] need to defend himself he didn't need to
[48:33] set the record straight
[48:37] he could stand there and he could have
[48:40] exposed and Unwound the whole thing
[48:44] but he stood there
[48:46] for Redemption
[48:49] he was being humiliated
[48:52] slapped in the face
[48:54] mocked until they would the Roman
[48:57] soldiers would take him and plot a crown
[48:59] of thorns
[49:01] why did they put the crown of thorns on
[49:02] his head because the Jews made the
[49:05] accusation that he called himself King
[49:07] of the Jews and he was King of the Jews
[49:09] and they were mocking him as king of the
[49:12] Jews mocking the claims putting purple
[49:16] robe about him amen making a stick a
[49:19] scepter amen and putting it in his hand
[49:22] and they were making fun of him
[49:25] and he never said a word to him
[49:29] my goodness if somebody misunderstands
[49:31] one statement we make we want to have a
[49:33] court proceeding
[49:35] get everybody together and set the
[49:36] record straight why to defend our
[49:38] reputation
[49:41] but Jesus didn't have to defend his
[49:43] reputation
[49:45] in fact he made himself of no reputation
[49:48] took on the form of a servant
[49:52] and humbled himself
[49:54] and here he was had the power to change
[49:57] everything and expose everything
[50:00] and he did nothing he said nothing kept
[50:03] quiet
[50:05] he's taken the Pilot's Court in pilate's
[50:07] court he he he reveals how powerful he
[50:11] is and who's in control of the situation
[50:13] because pilate is frustrated he's stuck
[50:15] between he knows Jesus is innocent he's
[50:18] stuck between these power Rivals and the
[50:21] Jews have him between a rock and a hard
[50:22] place he doesn't want to he doesn't want
[50:25] to judge Jesus his wife has a dream says
[50:27] to have nothing to do with this
[50:28] righteous man he knows they've delivered
[50:30] him for Envy he knows all of this but
[50:32] they're pulling some political moves
[50:35] and he's stuck in this situation and
[50:38] he's so frustrated Jesus won't answer
[50:40] because he's trying to look for
[50:41] something that gives him justification
[50:43] to let him go
[50:46] he's trying to get out of the pickle
[50:48] he's in and Jesus won't say anything and
[50:50] then he finally says don't you know why
[50:52] don't you speak don't you know I have
[50:54] power to save your life I have power to
[50:55] have you crucified and Jesus simply says
[50:57] you have no power at all unless it were
[51:00] given to you from above
[51:02] he didn't defend himself he didn't he
[51:05] didn't get out of trouble he just let
[51:06] pilate know
[51:07] everything's working according to plan
[51:10] I have nothing more to say and he says
[51:12] but the greater condemnation is for he
[51:15] that delivered you delivered me to you
[51:19] you're playing your role you're doing
[51:21] your part
[51:22] and Jesus was playing his part he was
[51:24] being led dumb to the slaughter
[51:28] as a lamb not defending himself I tell
[51:32] you friends I I need more character
[51:36] because if that was me and I knew those
[51:39] Witnesses were lying and I could tell
[51:41] them where they lied and when they lied
[51:43] and how much got paid and who was wrong
[51:45] and who did wrong and who
[51:47] I'm telling you it's going to take a
[51:49] greater power I meant it's going to take
[51:51] the working of the Holy Ghost to
[51:52] overcome this flesh in me because I
[51:55] would feel so right such righteous
[51:56] indignation and such justification for
[51:59] setting the record straight but brother
[52:01] Branham when he was being lied about and
[52:03] withheld from the platform standing in
[52:05] the wings of the auditorium amen he
[52:07] could have went and exposed the entire
[52:09] life that these ministers were telling
[52:11] to the congregation saying brother Ben
[52:12] couldn't make it his brother's sick he
[52:14] can't be here that day standing in the
[52:16] wings with another brother encouraging
[52:18] him to step out and expose the whole
[52:20] thing brother bear said I can't do that
[52:23] he said that could hurt that man's
[52:26] Ministry
[52:31] that's the life I want to live
[52:34] that's the life I want to live I don't
[52:36] have to prove I don't have to defend I I
[52:39] don't have to to do all of these things
[52:42] amen that others feel are necessary and
[52:45] I felt it's necessary I don't want to do
[52:47] that
[52:48] I want to take him as my pattern I want
[52:50] his life to be in me
[52:52] and I want to make room for that life
[52:55] amen I want to I want to forsake
[52:57] everything else and I want to feed on
[52:59] the word and receive of that life until
[53:01] that life takes over and and I can
[53:03] follow suit with Christ
[53:06] not just for myself not so that I can
[53:08] get to heaven and get a merit badge and
[53:10] a pat on the back and say good boy I
[53:12] want to do it because it opens the door
[53:14] to Redemption to everyone around me
[53:16] because I can't bring Redemption through
[53:18] pride and arrogancy I can't bring
[53:19] Redemption I can only bring Redemption
[53:21] the way Christ brought Redemption amen
[53:23] and I need to make myself of no
[53:25] reputation and humble myself and take on
[53:27] the form of a servant for everyone
[53:29] that's around me
[53:33] praise God
[53:35] amen
[53:39] Paul gives us a couple admonitions here
[53:41] Romans 12 he says for I say to the grace
[53:44] given unto me to every man that is among
[53:46] you not to think of himself more highly
[53:48] than he ought to think
[53:49] but to think soberly according as God
[53:51] had dealt to every man The Measure of
[53:54] Faith
[53:55] you say I believe the message how do you
[53:57] believe the message
[53:59] was it your brain
[54:01] was it your Superior understanding the
[54:03] good genetics from a genius mom and a
[54:05] genius dad
[54:08] the only reason you believe this message
[54:09] that was given to you to believe
[54:12] because you had representation in heaven
[54:14] and you have a sieging of eternal life
[54:16] that can believe you have something in
[54:18] you to believe with
[54:21] so don't think we ought to think of
[54:23] ourselves more highly than we ought to
[54:24] we in the flesh are not powerful we in
[54:26] the flesh are not great we in the flesh
[54:28] are not special
[54:30] it's the sieging of God that's special
[54:34] and that's the original us anyways
[54:37] so that's the part that I want to lean
[54:39] to and give preference to and live for
[54:41] because that's was meant to be me from
[54:43] the beginning
[54:45] praise God he also says in First
[54:48] Corinthians 8 now is touching things
[54:50] offered into Idols we know that we all
[54:52] have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but
[54:55] charity edifyeth and if any man think
[54:58] that he knoweth anything he knoweth
[55:00] nothing yet as he ought to know but if
[55:02] any man love God the same is known of
[55:04] him
[55:06] If any man think he know anything well
[55:08] you know when I come to the message and
[55:10] I started getting all the doctrines
[55:11] lined up and I went through the church
[55:12] age book I mean I knew something
[55:15] I knew things my my grandfather didn't
[55:17] know I knew things that the pastor in
[55:19] the church I attended didn't know I knew
[55:20] stuff
[55:22] is that right
[55:24] and you know what that knowledge did it
[55:26] puffed up
[55:30] oh God rich in Mercy
[55:33] he would pop our bubble from time to
[55:34] time
[55:36] he would take his little pin of trials
[55:38] and tribulations and every once in a
[55:39] while he'd just stick it right there and
[55:41] so that you wouldn't think of yourself
[55:42] more highly than you ought to
[55:45] and when you think that you know
[55:47] something then all of a sudden you know
[55:49] I'd go on my Rampage against all you
[55:51] know my co-workers against everybody and
[55:53] denominations and I I had the scriptures
[55:55] and I would go on my little war path my
[55:57] Rampage because nobody could stand Toe
[56:00] to Toe with me then all of a sudden God
[56:01] would bring me in contact with a real
[56:03] good Theologian and he would ask me some
[56:05] questions and in a few minutes I wanted
[56:07] to stop talking
[56:09] I was looking for the conversation but I
[56:12] was ready to bail in no time lord get me
[56:14] out of this where did he come up with
[56:15] those scriptures I've never heard those
[56:16] before
[56:18] and oh the mercy of God
[56:21] the grace of God when you think you know
[56:24] something we know nothing as we ought to
[56:29] you Amen brother Ben even when you come
[56:30] to the seals he says I know you're not
[56:32] getting it
[56:33] you're not seeing it he said frankly I
[56:35] don't see it like I ought to
[56:38] amen and I'm telling you this message
[56:41] all that God's revealed to us and all
[56:43] that God's shown to you I can still say
[56:45] I don't know it like I ought to you
[56:46] there's so much more it's so much deeper
[56:49] it's so much richer amen he's
[56:50] continually unfolding amen I don't want
[56:52] to get to the place where I say I know
[56:54] the message no and you know what I don't
[56:56] know the message and I didn't find the
[56:58] message the message found me but I am
[57:01] learning and I'm seeking and I'm wanting
[57:03] to know and I'm asking God to show me
[57:05] more
[57:08] the problem when we get to the place
[57:09] where we say well I know the message
[57:10] amen right there we begin to plateau
[57:14] because we've got this this sort of
[57:17] confidence amen and God give us
[57:19] Revelation by Grace Amen in that
[57:21] Revelation by Grace shouldn't bring us
[57:23] into a a sense of Pride and a sense of
[57:26] self-assurance where well I know well
[57:28] you only know what's been given to you
[57:30] no and you don't know yet how much you
[57:32] don't know
[57:33] [Music]
[57:36] I mean I believe I I feel like God has
[57:38] showed us so much
[57:40] and he's revealed so much and I feel
[57:42] like from where I was amen even just a
[57:44] few years ago to where I'm now amen it's
[57:46] drastic changes in Revelation amen but
[57:49] the problem is I don't know how much I
[57:51] don't know
[57:53] so if we draw a scale amen and our scale
[57:55] is from here to a hundred and this is
[57:58] the full knowledge of full understanding
[57:59] amen we grow so fast and so much we
[58:02] think we've grown from here to here and
[58:04] we're almost at the top when in reality
[58:05] we may have grown from here to here
[58:09] and that was tremendous for us it
[58:11] changed it blew our mind it changed our
[58:13] lives amen it changed everything around
[58:15] us but it might have been like one two
[58:17] clicks on the scale of God because God
[58:19] will be unfolding himself throughout
[58:20] eternity
[58:22] and we think we've been in the message
[58:23] so long that such great Revelation such
[58:25] good things we've been from here to here
[58:27] we have no idea what the Gap is
[58:30] that we still need to know
[58:32] so we don't need to be there's nothing
[58:34] to be proud or puffed up about the only
[58:36] thing we should be expressing is Extreme
[58:38] gratitude extreme gratitude for the
[58:40] grace of God and the mercy of God and we
[58:42] should humble ourselves and say no
[58:44] matter how much I know there is so much
[58:46] that I don't know that I want to know
[58:48] that I wish I knew and I'm dependent on
[58:50] God to bring it to me by revelation
[58:54] there's so many things I've studied and
[58:56] studied and studied until my eyes have
[58:57] gone cross I've read quote lists with
[58:59] hundreds of quotes on a subject wanting
[59:01] to know it and I tell you what no matter
[59:03] how much I read it it will not unlock to
[59:05] me it's going to take the grace of God
[59:06] to bring a revelation
[59:08] much study is not going to produce it
[59:11] right so we're at the mercy of God but
[59:13] we thank God for his Mercy
[59:16] thank God for his grace
[59:18] so we
[59:20] we need to follow Christ's pattern
[59:26] this is Paul this is what
[59:29] Paul says
[59:31] so I might also have confidence in the
[59:33] flesh if any other man thinketh that he
[59:35] hath whereof he might Trust In the Flesh
[59:37] I more
[59:38] circumcised The Eighth Day of the stock
[59:40] of Israel The Tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew
[59:42] of the Hebrews as touching the law of
[59:44] Pharisee concerning seal persecuting the
[59:47] church touching the righteousness which
[59:49] is in the law blameless but what things
[59:51] were gained to me those I counted lost
[59:53] for Christ they doubtless and I count
[59:55] all things but lost for the Excellency
[59:57] of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord
[59:59] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[1:00:01] things and do count them but none that I
[1:00:04] may win Christ
[1:00:06] Paul was proud
[1:00:09] and Paul at the time he was proud not
[1:00:12] proud at the time he's saying this he
[1:00:13] was converted
[1:00:15] but he had pride and he looks back on
[1:00:17] his list of things that he had whereof
[1:00:19] he could Glory of and he had a list that
[1:00:21] he could be confident and he said before
[1:00:25] and and that list when he met Christ
[1:00:28] became dung to him
[1:00:31] and God brought him down amen when he
[1:00:34] met the pillar of fire brother remember
[1:00:36] said he knocked Paul off of his high
[1:00:38] horse
[1:00:39] and he was rolling around in the dust of
[1:00:42] the ground saying Lord who are you
[1:00:45] and God brought Paul to humanity
[1:00:48] amen Paul
[1:00:50] could not continue on like this
[1:00:53] and bring the message of redemption to
[1:00:56] the Gentiles
[1:00:58] it would come with the wrong
[1:00:59] characteristics
[1:01:01] God had to get a hold upon and brother
[1:01:04] man says Paul when he saw that angel of
[1:01:06] the light above him and called it Lord
[1:01:07] he fell on the dust of the earth he
[1:01:09] recognized the humility I'm no more no
[1:01:12] wonder Isaiah could say woe is me for
[1:01:14] I've seen the Lord of God of hosts yet
[1:01:16] being a prophet and yet Paul being a
[1:01:18] great man a scholar but when he come in
[1:01:20] the presence of God he humbled himself
[1:01:22] he had to become humble he had to become
[1:01:25] nothing he had to Cast Away all he ever
[1:01:27] knew and all he ever learned to win
[1:01:29] Christ because God couldn't take Paul
[1:01:31] that way Amen to bring Redemption to the
[1:01:35] Gentiles
[1:01:36] because he had to keep the
[1:01:38] characteristics true
[1:01:39] he had to come through humility that's
[1:01:41] why Paul said I came to you with fear
[1:01:43] and much trembling
[1:01:45] not with the Excellency of worth why he
[1:01:47] had to come through humility
[1:01:49] because he had to keep the same pattern
[1:01:53] says
[1:01:54] Paul says in First Corinthians and last
[1:01:57] of all he was seen of me also as one
[1:01:59] born out of due time for I am the least
[1:02:01] of the Apostles that I am not meat to be
[1:02:03] called an apostle because I persecuted
[1:02:05] the Church of God but by the grace of
[1:02:08] God I am what I am and his grace which
[1:02:11] was bestowed upon me was not in vain but
[1:02:13] I labored more abundantly than they all
[1:02:15] yet not I but the grace of God which was
[1:02:18] with me
[1:02:19] today I was wrong is what he's saying
[1:02:23] I was wrong and all my wisdom and all my
[1:02:26] education and all my understanding all
[1:02:28] my intellect and all my zeal
[1:02:31] I was persecuting Jesus Christ
[1:02:34] the Messiah
[1:02:37] the word that he claimed to believe he
[1:02:39] was persecuting and it humbled Paul and
[1:02:42] now Paul comes to the place where he's
[1:02:43] an apostle God called him to be Apostle
[1:02:45] he knows his position he knows his place
[1:02:46] but being called to be an apostle and an
[1:02:48] apostle to the Gentiles amen and knowing
[1:02:51] that he's a light to the Gentiles which
[1:02:52] is the Fulfillment of scripture doesn't
[1:02:54] puff puff puff up Paul because Paul was
[1:02:57] already a base and Paul says I'm not
[1:03:00] even worthy to be called an apostle
[1:03:01] because I persecuted the church but by
[1:03:03] the grace of God
[1:03:05] I am what I am
[1:03:07] I tell you I'm not worthy to be called
[1:03:09] as bride
[1:03:10] but by the grace of God I am what I am I
[1:03:13] can say I am by faith I can say I am
[1:03:16] because he's revealed it to my heart I
[1:03:17] believe that I am and I love all that
[1:03:19] comes with it amen but it cannot cause
[1:03:21] this man to get puffed up because I am
[1:03:24] what I am by the grace of God
[1:03:27] so now let me labor more abundantly
[1:03:30] because of who I am
[1:03:34] second Corinthians 12 he says unless I
[1:03:37] should be exalted above measure through
[1:03:38] the abundance of the revelations there
[1:03:40] was given to me a thorn in the flesh the
[1:03:42] messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I
[1:03:44] should be exalted above measure God is
[1:03:47] so gracious that he cannot let his
[1:03:49] message be carried with pride and
[1:03:51] arrogancy amen and over exaltation of
[1:03:54] the man that God even though he abaced
[1:03:57] Paul humbled Paul Paul repented and
[1:04:00] rejected all of his past life because
[1:04:02] the abundance of Revelation was so great
[1:04:04] God allowed an Affliction in Paul's life
[1:04:07] a thorn in the flesh a messenger of
[1:04:09] Satan so that he would not be exalted
[1:04:11] above measure
[1:04:12] this is how serious this is that the
[1:04:15] message of Grace the Redemption message
[1:04:17] is carried in humility
[1:04:21] God saw to it that it would be carried
[1:04:23] in humility
[1:04:27] this is what Paul says
[1:04:29] First Corinthians 4 9.
[1:04:31] for I think that God has set forth us
[1:04:34] the apostles last
[1:04:36] remember his first will be last
[1:04:38] if you're going to be head of men you
[1:04:40] become the servant of all
[1:04:42] here he is the Apostle of Jesus Christ
[1:04:45] by meeting a pillar of Fire here he is
[1:04:48] the first church age messenger the
[1:04:50] messenger of grace to the Gentiles here
[1:04:52] he will be the man who will write most
[1:04:53] of what becomes our new testament
[1:04:57] and he says God has set forth us
[1:04:59] Apostles last
[1:05:02] as it were appointed to death for we are
[1:05:04] made a spectacle unto the world and to
[1:05:07] angels and to men for we are fools for
[1:05:10] Christ's sake but you are wise in Christ
[1:05:12] we are weak but you are strong ye are
[1:05:16] honorable but we are despised even into
[1:05:18] this present hour we both hunger and
[1:05:20] thirst and are naked and are buffeted
[1:05:22] and have no certain dwelling place and
[1:05:24] labor working with our own hands being
[1:05:26] reviled we bless being persecuted we
[1:05:29] suffer being defamed we entreat we are
[1:05:32] made as the filth of the world and are
[1:05:34] are the off scouring of all things unto
[1:05:37] this day
[1:05:40] amen that is not what you put on your
[1:05:44] tombstone
[1:05:46] you put he was a great man great father
[1:05:48] and
[1:05:50] but Paul is saying we have become
[1:05:52] nothing so that you can become strong
[1:05:55] we've become nothing so that you can get
[1:05:57] the Revelation we've become nothing that
[1:05:59] so you can be United with Christ he
[1:06:01] became nothing amen he became the the
[1:06:04] the filth of the world and the off
[1:06:06] scouring of all things into this day why
[1:06:08] did he do it he became that for their
[1:06:11] sakes
[1:06:12] he became that to bring Redemption amen
[1:06:15] he lost his reputation he lost his
[1:06:18] Prestige he lost his honor amongst all
[1:06:20] of his colleagues amen they lost
[1:06:22] everything and he gave it up willingly
[1:06:24] and counted as done Amen to win Christ
[1:06:26] but then he he he remained nothing in
[1:06:29] the eyes amen of all of those people so
[1:06:32] that he could bring Redemption to the
[1:06:34] Gentiles
[1:06:37] praise God what a pattern
[1:06:41] what a pattern
[1:06:43] in Acts 24 he says but this I confess
[1:06:45] unto thee that
[1:06:47] after the after the way which they call
[1:06:50] heresy so worshiped by the god of my
[1:06:53] fathers believing all things which are
[1:06:54] written in the law and in the prophets
[1:06:56] this is the Apostle Paul standing in
[1:06:58] court he's being tried and being
[1:07:00] questioned and he says I confess unto
[1:07:03] thee
[1:07:04] that the way in which they call heresy
[1:07:06] is the way I worship the god of my
[1:07:08] father he didn't say it was heresy he
[1:07:10] said they call it heresy but he's also
[1:07:12] not defending himself
[1:07:14] he's also not trying to set the record
[1:07:16] straight and he's not trying to make
[1:07:17] them look bad so he can look good all
[1:07:19] he's saying is believing all things
[1:07:21] which are written in the loan in the
[1:07:22] prophets I I admit that I worship the
[1:07:26] way they call heresy but I'm believing
[1:07:28] the Bible
[1:07:30] amen we can say the same thing I admit
[1:07:33] amen that what we believe is called all
[1:07:35] kinds of things is that right call false
[1:07:38] Doctrine call false teaching call
[1:07:39] because it's called all kinds of things
[1:07:41] I admit that the way I worship God is
[1:07:44] called all kinds of dirty names amen but
[1:07:46] I still believe the Bible
[1:07:49] I'm worshiping with God according to the
[1:07:50] Bible and I'm not here to defend myself
[1:07:53] and listen I'm not here to defend the
[1:07:55] message
[1:07:58] there's nothing to defend the message is
[1:08:01] my defense I don't defend my Defender
[1:08:03] the word is my defense I'm not here to
[1:08:05] defend it
[1:08:07] I'm not here I'm not here let's just say
[1:08:10] it this way I'm not here to weaken the
[1:08:13] beautiful revelation of the word by
[1:08:15] becoming greater than the word
[1:08:17] what do you mean brother if the word
[1:08:19] needs me to defend it then I've become
[1:08:21] greater than the word
[1:08:25] but no that's not my job I'm not here to
[1:08:27] defend anything I'm here to believe all
[1:08:29] that's written in the law and the
[1:08:30] prophets
[1:08:32] and to worship God according to the word
[1:08:34] that's why I'm here
[1:08:38] praise be to go on
[1:08:40] so
[1:08:42] that was Paul
[1:08:45] the question is can we follow the same
[1:08:47] pattern
[1:08:50] you know
[1:08:52] I'm so thankful for the life of a
[1:08:53] prophet because we can see that brother
[1:08:54] Ben even struggling with his own
[1:08:57] Humanity following this pattern
[1:08:59] even after the seals the rejection was
[1:09:02] still eating at him and he wanted to
[1:09:03] leave the field and we know all of that
[1:09:05] standing in the Gap we've talked about
[1:09:06] so many times I'm not going to go into
[1:09:08] detail on it but but we know he's
[1:09:10] struggling with his own humanity and the
[1:09:12] rejection and the offense and and on
[1:09:14] he's wanting to go away and and he's not
[1:09:16] wanting to go live sinful and he's not
[1:09:18] one he just wants to get away from the
[1:09:19] pressure
[1:09:21] and God corrects him and and brings him
[1:09:23] back in line with the word and and he
[1:09:25] corrects himself
[1:09:26] and he and he goes right back to the
[1:09:29] very people that hurt him
[1:09:31] because he says I let the sick people
[1:09:33] lay
[1:09:34] he said I've got to bring a message he
[1:09:36] goes I've got to get out to the people
[1:09:39] what was he doing he was now willingly
[1:09:42] he was making himself no reputation he
[1:09:45] was taking on the form of a servant he
[1:09:46] was going right back into a painful
[1:09:48] situation right back into a difficult
[1:09:51] situation for their sakes
[1:09:55] because they needed healing they needed
[1:09:58] this ministry they needed this gift and
[1:09:59] he put himself right Back In Harm's Way
[1:10:02] for others
[1:10:05] he did exactly what Jesus Christ did he
[1:10:07] did exactly what Paul the Apostle did he
[1:10:09] did it and I'm so glad he was honest
[1:10:11] about it so we can see the struggle
[1:10:14] I'm so glad he came and told us
[1:10:15] everything so we don't think well you
[1:10:17] get the Holy Ghost and this is easy and
[1:10:18] all you have to do and you go no with
[1:10:20] the Holy Ghost amen as an adopted son
[1:10:23] who God had put the sword in his hand of
[1:10:25] the word it handed him the word amen he
[1:10:27] was still struggling with his flesh
[1:10:29] praise God
[1:10:32] but in the end he brought the flesh
[1:10:34] subject to the will of God he laid down
[1:10:36] his life once again he surrendered all
[1:10:39] over again
[1:10:40] I'm so thankful for that you know I
[1:10:42] fought a lot of wrestling matches with
[1:10:44] myself and son I'm a one and some of
[1:10:45] them I've lost
[1:10:49] but I want to lay this life down
[1:10:53] 70 80 90 years what is it anyways in
[1:10:55] comparison eternity if I have to live
[1:10:57] all this life rejected and Outcast and
[1:10:59] misunderstood and mocked so what
[1:11:02] we put too much value on the flesh
[1:11:04] there's very little value for the flesh
[1:11:07] what what's what has great value is the
[1:11:10] soul
[1:11:11] amen
[1:11:13] so I want to I want to look at Peter for
[1:11:16] a minute
[1:11:17] in Luke 5 when Jesus comes to Peter he's
[1:11:21] a fisherman and he has to use his boat
[1:11:23] to preach a message after the message he
[1:11:25] goes out and says take me out fishing
[1:11:27] cast down the net we know Peter says we
[1:11:29] fished all night but at Thy Word
[1:11:31] we'll cast down the Nets we did and they
[1:11:33] caught a huge catch of fish and this is
[1:11:35] where we're at in the story and then
[1:11:36] Simon Peter saw it he fell down at Jesus
[1:11:38] knees saying depart from me
[1:11:40] for I am a sinful Man O Lord
[1:11:43] this is how Peter begins his
[1:11:46] relationship with Jesus Christ
[1:11:48] an absolute utter humility recognizing
[1:11:51] he was vile he was a sinner amen and he
[1:11:54] didn't even feel worthy to be in the
[1:11:56] presence of the Lord he said depart from
[1:11:59] me for I am a sinful man what do you
[1:12:01] have to do with me what is the greatness
[1:12:03] that you have anything to do with me
[1:12:06] and look at the humility amen of Peter
[1:12:09] but the problem is Peter didn't stay in
[1:12:12] this position amen because as Peter
[1:12:14] became part of the ministry amen and and
[1:12:16] Peter began to receive a portion of the
[1:12:19] ministry and he went out and the
[1:12:21] campaign meetings and he was seen with
[1:12:23] Jesus and he was one of his chosen
[1:12:25] disciples and he would go and work
[1:12:27] miracles amen by the hands of Peter he
[1:12:29] would he would go out and pray for the
[1:12:31] sick and they were healed and cast out
[1:12:32] demons and they were healed and he was
[1:12:34] part of this great healing campaign that
[1:12:36] was taking place where 5 000 men plus
[1:12:39] women and children were gathered at one
[1:12:41] time amen this was huge and all of a
[1:12:43] sudden you see Peter begin to get lifted
[1:12:45] up in Pride
[1:12:47] Peter began
[1:12:49] we we have this scripture which I always
[1:12:52] find funny
[1:12:53] and when he came to Capernaum and being
[1:12:55] in the house he asked him what was it
[1:12:57] that you disputed among yourselves by
[1:12:58] the way
[1:12:59] he says when you guys were having that
[1:13:01] little discussion and disputing what
[1:13:03] what was it and and the Bible says he
[1:13:06] already knew what it was
[1:13:10] but they held their peace for by the way
[1:13:12] they had disputed among themselves who
[1:13:14] should be the greatest
[1:13:16] here they're walking with Jesus amen
[1:13:18] disciples they're in this great they're
[1:13:20] in this fantastic Ministry amen well
[1:13:23] known things are moving things are
[1:13:25] happening and we're they're with the
[1:13:26] main guy and they're the main guys of
[1:13:28] the main guy
[1:13:31] things are moving and and now uh uh
[1:13:35] they're having this discussion dispute
[1:13:36] along the way and Jesus knows exactly
[1:13:38] what it's all about amen and it was they
[1:13:41] were they were with him along the way
[1:13:42] they were disputing along the way about
[1:13:45] who would be greatest amen and it was
[1:13:47] worth arguing over
[1:13:49] to them
[1:13:51] until Jesus asked him a question what
[1:13:53] were you disputing over and then it
[1:13:55] wasn't worth saying anything anymore
[1:13:58] nobody felt like talking then
[1:14:01] because he exposed the whole thing they
[1:14:03] all of a sudden amen Peter went from
[1:14:06] just being in completely unworthy to be
[1:14:09] in the presence of Jesus Christ
[1:14:11] to in a short period of time he's
[1:14:14] rebuking the Lord
[1:14:17] that's what the Bible said he rebuked
[1:14:19] the Lord when when Jesus says amen the
[1:14:22] son of man will be go to Jerusalem be
[1:14:24] evenly mistreated be killed in the three
[1:14:26] days raises again and Peter took him
[1:14:29] aside and rebuked him the Bible said he
[1:14:31] rebuked the Lord saying far be it from
[1:14:33] thee for a thing like this to happen to
[1:14:35] thee amen and here and Jesus turned to
[1:14:38] him and said get thee behind me Satan
[1:14:40] I mean what a conversation
[1:14:43] this was the man that was so humble so
[1:14:45] broken amen that he would drop to his
[1:14:48] knees when he saw the miracle and said
[1:14:49] depart from me amen I'm a sinner I'm not
[1:14:52] worthy to be in your presence and now
[1:14:54] he's taking the Lord aside and he's
[1:14:55] rebuking him for something he said
[1:14:58] then he rebukes him again when they're
[1:15:01] in the crowd and the woman with the
[1:15:02] blood issue touched the Hem of His
[1:15:03] Garment and says and Jesus says somebody
[1:15:06] touched me and and Peter's rebuking him
[1:15:08] saying lord they're all throng thee what
[1:15:10] are you talking about
[1:15:12] and brother Branham dramatizes it
[1:15:15] right Billy Graham tells us more I mean
[1:15:18] he can read between the lines and
[1:15:20] brother man was telling us he said he
[1:15:22] was saying you sound crazy stop that
[1:15:29] that's a good question was Peter
[1:15:31] protecting Jesus reputation or Peter's
[1:15:32] reputation
[1:15:36] when he rebuked Jesus for saying that he
[1:15:37] was going to Jerusalem and be evily
[1:15:39] mistreated and fall into the hands of
[1:15:41] man amen was it Peter's love for Jesus
[1:15:44] or Peter's love for for Peter
[1:15:47] Peter didn't want this massive campaign
[1:15:49] this great movement that he was on top
[1:15:52] of he didn't want it to go away
[1:15:55] so all of a sudden Peter goes from so
[1:15:58] humble
[1:15:59] he doesn't deserve to be in the presence
[1:16:01] of Jesus
[1:16:03] to where he can dispute with all those
[1:16:05] around him who's going to be the
[1:16:06] greatest and even take this Lord aside
[1:16:08] and rebuke him for things he would say
[1:16:09] and try to get him to say things
[1:16:12] that doesn't sound so odd
[1:16:19] this is why Jesus looks at Peter and
[1:16:21] says Peter
[1:16:22] Satan has desire to sift thee like we
[1:16:26] and he said I have prayed for thee
[1:16:28] that thy faith failed not
[1:16:31] he never said I prayed for thee that
[1:16:33] this trial wouldn't come
[1:16:35] he never said and Jesus says I love it
[1:16:39] we've talked about it before but he says
[1:16:42] he says Peter
[1:16:44] Satan has desired to Sifty like we
[1:16:47] that means Satan come and ask permission
[1:16:50] and Jesus didn't say don't worry I told
[1:16:52] him no
[1:16:55] why because Peter needs to be knocked
[1:16:58] off of his high horse
[1:17:00] because Peter's going to be given the
[1:17:02] keys to the kingdom and he cannot carry
[1:17:04] those keys in that condition
[1:17:08] he cannot bring Redemption outside of
[1:17:10] humility he's got to be brought low
[1:17:17] even at the Last Supper when Jesus is
[1:17:19] speaking to his disciples and telling
[1:17:21] them what would happen the pride of uh
[1:17:24] of Peter rise and said Lord I'm ready to
[1:17:27] go with you both unto prison and to
[1:17:29] death
[1:17:31] and he said I tell thee Peter the
[1:17:33] shall not Crow this day before Thou
[1:17:35] shalt Thrice deny that thou knowest me
[1:17:39] then a little further he says then the
[1:17:41] Lord turned and looked upon Peter this
[1:17:43] is after Peter denied the Lord
[1:17:45] and Peter remembered the word of the
[1:17:47] Lord how he had said unto him before the
[1:17:49] Crow Thou shalt deny me Thrice and
[1:17:51] Peter went out and wept bitterly
[1:17:56] you know God is so gracious
[1:17:59] that he allowed Peter to go through this
[1:18:01] trial but he prayed for Peter that his
[1:18:03] faith failed not
[1:18:04] that he bypassed the trial because Peter
[1:18:07] needed to go through the trial
[1:18:09] Peter needed to come back to humility he
[1:18:12] needed to come back and realize that
[1:18:14] he's nothing on his own
[1:18:18] and
[1:18:19] and God is so gracious that he comes to
[1:18:21] him by the Sea of Tiberius and he
[1:18:22] restores Peter in Fellowship Peter does
[1:18:25] thou lovethstown me feed my Lambs does
[1:18:27] that love is thou on me three times
[1:18:29] because he denied the Lord three times
[1:18:30] three times he gives him Restoration and
[1:18:32] brings him back into the vision
[1:18:35] but now Peter's whole attitude has
[1:18:37] changed amen Peter is humble Peter is
[1:18:39] different when Peter goes amen after the
[1:18:41] after the uh Pentecost after the Holy
[1:18:44] Ghost Falls him he and John go walking
[1:18:46] Amen to the temple amen and they heal a
[1:18:48] man and when they begin to worship him
[1:18:50] he said don't look on us is that we've
[1:18:51] done this of Our Own Strength
[1:18:53] he said we've done this in the name of
[1:18:55] Jesus Christ whom you crucify now he's
[1:18:58] not willing to be proud he's not willing
[1:19:00] to be puffed up he's not willing to be
[1:19:01] in that position but now he knows who he
[1:19:03] is and he knows where he is and he knows
[1:19:05] where the grace of God is
[1:19:08] I looked at Peter's life
[1:19:12] and
[1:19:13] I'm ashamed to say I recognize my life
[1:19:16] in Peter's life
[1:19:19] I recognize myself coming to the message
[1:19:23] I Was So Unworthy even to hear these
[1:19:25] things I felt so grateful I felt like I
[1:19:28] felt like I was absolutely nothing
[1:19:30] but God rescued me
[1:19:32] I was so grateful I was I was so I was
[1:19:35] just like Peter
[1:19:38] but then
[1:19:40] I don't know where it came from I don't
[1:19:41] know how it happened but you become
[1:19:43] proud that you know what other people
[1:19:45] don't know proud that you're the bride
[1:19:47] proud that you're the elect proud that
[1:19:49] you're chosen
[1:19:53] and I hope I'm not the only one
[1:19:57] but God has a way of taking his needle
[1:20:01] and popping our bubble
[1:20:04] he lets us make some mistakes
[1:20:07] he doesn't say things wrong he makes us
[1:20:09] have to come back and correct things and
[1:20:11] clear things up we make fools of
[1:20:13] ourselves sometimes
[1:20:16] how many of you look back over yourself
[1:20:17] in your early days in the message and
[1:20:20] you shudder thinking of the pride and
[1:20:22] the way you've spoken to things you said
[1:20:23] and you just pray that everybody forgot
[1:20:28] I just pray they forgot what I said I
[1:20:31] said things so bold like I knew what I
[1:20:33] was talking about and I realized I had
[1:20:34] no clue what I was talking about
[1:20:36] going around correcting everybody and
[1:20:39] I hope everybody forgot that
[1:20:41] and if you remember please don't tell me
[1:20:43] you remember it I can't hardly stand the
[1:20:46] thought of it myself
[1:20:48] but then God allows us to fall on our
[1:20:51] face
[1:20:52] Satan desires assistance like wheat and
[1:20:54] God doesn't stop him
[1:20:56] they just prays that our faith will hold
[1:20:59] until I pray that we finally get to the
[1:21:02] place where we can say without him I'm
[1:21:04] nothing
[1:21:05] I am worthless I am in my flesh I am
[1:21:09] absolutely nothing without god without
[1:21:12] if it wasn't for a sieging of God an
[1:21:14] attribute of God I I would be who knows
[1:21:17] where I'd be doing who knows what I
[1:21:18] would be doing
[1:21:19] if it wasn't for God bringing the
[1:21:21] message my way amen and sparking that
[1:21:23] seed to life where would I be and what
[1:21:25] would I be doing and now amen I took
[1:21:28] this glorious message and I used it to
[1:21:30] bring pride and arrogancy and attention
[1:21:32] to myself
[1:21:35] I used it to elevate myself over over
[1:21:38] other people
[1:21:39] and that's never what the message was
[1:21:41] for
[1:21:42] it was only to bring a true revelation
[1:21:44] of who I really am and that true
[1:21:46] revelation of who I really am
[1:21:48] ought to put me in humility because if I
[1:21:50] am like him he can humble himself if I
[1:21:53] am like him he's not proud he's not
[1:21:55] arrogant he's not boastful
[1:21:57] so if I really come from him amen and
[1:22:00] that Holy Ghost is drawing that life out
[1:22:02] of that seed then then then I don't need
[1:22:05] to lean to the side of arrogancy That's
[1:22:07] My Flesh I need to move to humility
[1:22:10] and still remember I'm nothing
[1:22:15] I I look at the life of Peter
[1:22:18] and maybe it's not just me
[1:22:20] but maybe it matches
[1:22:22] many of our lives
[1:22:25] maybe it matches us as a whole
[1:22:27] as the bride over the last so many years
[1:22:31] but I say oh God
[1:22:33] I want to I want to come to the place
[1:22:36] where it's all you
[1:22:38] and I never lose my gratitude and and in
[1:22:41] that I don't I also I don't feel like I
[1:22:44] have to get to the place where I say uh
[1:22:45] you know I'm a worthless nobody no good
[1:22:48] nothing a piece of dirt no he redeemed
[1:22:50] me that makes me valuable
[1:22:54] of myself I'm a disaster but he came
[1:22:57] down amen and he redeemed me and he
[1:22:59] cleansed me and he filled me I can no
[1:23:01] longer speak trash about myself because
[1:23:03] he redeemed me
[1:23:05] but I have to understand what's flesh
[1:23:08] and what's gone and if without God where
[1:23:10] would I be in the flesh
[1:23:12] so we don't have to take this false
[1:23:14] sense of humility and keep talking on no
[1:23:16] I I am saved by the grace of God he's
[1:23:19] called me before the foundation of the
[1:23:21] world I'm one of God's children and I
[1:23:22] believe that with all my heart and I'm
[1:23:24] not ashamed to say that
[1:23:26] but if that be true then I have to quit
[1:23:28] acting like a child of the devil and
[1:23:30] start acting like a child of God
[1:23:33] taking his characteristics and taking
[1:23:34] his nature amen and humbling myself to
[1:23:37] bring Redemption
[1:23:38] to everyone that's around me
[1:23:41] praise God
[1:23:43] God is good
[1:23:45] in First Corinthians 1 25
[1:23:48] says because the foolishness of God is
[1:23:51] wiser than men and the weakness of God
[1:23:53] is stronger than men for you see your
[1:23:55] calling brother and how that not many
[1:23:57] wise men after the flesh not many mighty
[1:23:59] not many noble are called
[1:24:01] but God hath chosen the foolish things
[1:24:03] of the world to confound the wise
[1:24:05] and God has chosen the weak things of
[1:24:07] the world to confuse confound the things
[1:24:09] which are mighty
[1:24:11] and base things of the world and things
[1:24:13] which are despised hath God chosen yea
[1:24:15] and things which are not to bring the
[1:24:17] knot things that are that no flesh
[1:24:19] should glory in his presence but of him
[1:24:21] are you in Christ Jesus of whom God has
[1:24:23] made unto us wisdom and righteousness
[1:24:25] and sanctification and Redemption that
[1:24:28] according as it is written he that
[1:24:30] glorieth let him glory in the Lord
[1:24:34] if God has chosen the foolish things
[1:24:38] if he's chosen the weak things he's
[1:24:40] chosen the things that are not
[1:24:43] if he's chosen the base things and the
[1:24:46] things that are despised why do I want
[1:24:48] to be anything other than that
[1:24:52] if that's what he's going to use to
[1:24:55] defeat the Devil and declare himself
[1:24:56] then that's all that I want to be I
[1:24:59] don't we want to be strong we want to be
[1:25:02] honored we want to be respected we want
[1:25:04] to be all of these things but God is not
[1:25:05] using that
[1:25:07] God is using the weak things and the
[1:25:09] base things and the things that are
[1:25:10] despised
[1:25:11] so praise God and in reality we're all
[1:25:14] nothing
[1:25:16] I mean really when you think about and
[1:25:17] the grants keeping things you look at
[1:25:19] the billions of people who are on the
[1:25:20] earth amen sometimes sometimes even in
[1:25:23] church we start to look at each other
[1:25:24] and exalt one above the other when that
[1:25:26] one's got a good Ministry in between the
[1:25:27] churches that's a good church but if you
[1:25:29] back away from even believing the
[1:25:31] message and fellowship and you go to the
[1:25:33] world Amen we're nothing our churches
[1:25:35] are nothing our ministers are nothing
[1:25:37] they're they're just regular people that
[1:25:39] people walk by and Overlook all the time
[1:25:43] we esteem one over another but really
[1:25:45] that's just because in our Circle we see
[1:25:46] it that way amen but you back out and
[1:25:48] get a world perspective these people are
[1:25:50] just as common as common can be nothing
[1:25:52] special whatsoever
[1:25:54] and those are the ones he wants
[1:25:57] those are the ones he wants to choose
[1:25:59] those are the ones he wants to show
[1:26:01] Redemption through
[1:26:03] so that's that's what I want to be amen
[1:26:08] God has always used the humble God has
[1:26:10] always done it this way if you think
[1:26:12] about Noah God took Noah who was a
[1:26:16] farmer
[1:26:17] and told him to build a giant ship
[1:26:21] but he was a farmer
[1:26:23] he could plant potatoes but he had to
[1:26:26] build a ship
[1:26:28] God it always he takes the most unlikely
[1:26:31] amen that's not the guy I would pick he
[1:26:34] has no engineering school no training I
[1:26:36] mean they could ask Noah you ever built
[1:26:37] a ship before no have you ever built one
[1:26:39] of those little ones kids build and
[1:26:40] Float across the pond no
[1:26:44] have you ever been on a boat no
[1:26:47] do you have any friends who have been on
[1:26:48] boats no
[1:26:54] that's the way God wanted it
[1:26:57] he didn't want no one to have
[1:26:58] understanding he didn't want Noah to
[1:27:00] have ability he didn't want nowhere to
[1:27:01] have strength he wanted to take
[1:27:03] something that was nothing and make
[1:27:04] something with somebody that was nothing
[1:27:07] that way that God gets all the credit
[1:27:09] for it
[1:27:12] Moses when he went to destroy Egypt he
[1:27:14] was an old man with a stick
[1:27:16] remember I said white beard hanging down
[1:27:17] his face didn't use it didn't use him
[1:27:20] earlier used him when he was weak or
[1:27:21] used him when he was unable used him
[1:27:23] when he had no association use him when
[1:27:25] he was all by himself back in the desert
[1:27:27] amen and then God took Moses and what
[1:27:29] was he doing brother brother always
[1:27:31] dramatizes these things and they're so
[1:27:32] important amen he's walking down with a
[1:27:34] stick in his head his wife and his baby
[1:27:36] on a donkey behind him and he's coming
[1:27:38] down and say what are you doing Moses
[1:27:39] where are you going he's I'm going to
[1:27:40] Egypt what for to take over
[1:27:44] it looks foolish it looks ridiculous but
[1:27:46] that's the way God wanted it
[1:27:50] he took a group of slaves that had been
[1:27:52] in bondage they had been out of their
[1:27:53] land they've been separated for over 400
[1:27:55] years they had been bondage in many of
[1:27:57] those years and in hard bondage for the
[1:27:59] last portion of that amen they had no
[1:28:01] military training they had no government
[1:28:03] structure they had nothing and God was
[1:28:05] going to take them to conquer and
[1:28:07] displace a land and a people and
[1:28:09] establish a nation
[1:28:11] beautiful
[1:28:13] he was going to take David a little boy
[1:28:15] to destroy a giant
[1:28:18] not Saul whose head and shoulders above
[1:28:21] no he's going to take a Shepherd boy
[1:28:24] to destroy a giant
[1:28:27] he was going to use Peter an illiterate
[1:28:30] fisherman who couldn't sign his name he
[1:28:32] was going to give him the keys to the
[1:28:33] kingdom
[1:28:36] the Way Up Is Down
[1:28:39] amen and he was going to take brother
[1:28:40] Branham a man with a seventh grade
[1:28:43] education
[1:28:45] to dip into the mysterious back part of
[1:28:48] God's mind
[1:28:50] and reveal what wasn't written under the
[1:28:54] seven Thunders
[1:28:57] a man who was rejected and despised all
[1:28:59] of his childhood come through poverty
[1:29:01] had limited education had no support
[1:29:03] from the systems and had no formal
[1:29:05] training
[1:29:06] it was so uh uh uh he was his education
[1:29:10] was so poor in such a way he had trouble
[1:29:12] sounding Out names and sounding Out
[1:29:14] words out of the King James Bible
[1:29:16] and to her when he first was in his
[1:29:18] ministry he'd have his girlfriend at the
[1:29:20] time his fiancee read his opening
[1:29:22] scripture for him she'd stand and read
[1:29:24] it and then he'd preach
[1:29:25] because he didn't have confidence to do
[1:29:27] it when he got down to Shreveport
[1:29:29] Louisiana there at the end of his
[1:29:31] ministry he asked Jack Moore to stand to
[1:29:32] read because the section he was going to
[1:29:33] read had a lot of names in it and he
[1:29:35] couldn't read those names
[1:29:38] what was he to do he was to bring the
[1:29:41] perfect revelation of the entire word
[1:29:43] with Divine vindication
[1:29:45] and he couldn't sound the words out that
[1:29:48] he was supposed to interpret
[1:29:52] what does God want this is what God
[1:29:55] wants he wants to take the nobodies to
[1:29:58] bring Redemption
[1:30:00] I don't want to all of a sudden try to
[1:30:02] become a somebody
[1:30:06] when God was going to bring the
[1:30:08] righteous line of Jesus Christ
[1:30:11] he had a tendency to use women who were
[1:30:13] Barren and couldn't conceive
[1:30:16] isn't that amazing
[1:30:18] he didn't bring the fruitful the wind
[1:30:20] had no problem but all the way through
[1:30:22] this lineage of Christ you kept finding
[1:30:25] women kept popping up who weren't able
[1:30:27] to have children they didn't have the
[1:30:28] ability they weren't strong that way in
[1:30:31] fertility but God chose them it's
[1:30:33] amazing to me
[1:30:35] the whole Bible is structured this way
[1:30:37] he took Sarah couldn't have a baby amen
[1:30:40] then took Rebecca to have Jacob and
[1:30:42] Rebecca also was Barren then had Rachel
[1:30:45] to have Joseph and Rachel was also
[1:30:47] barren
[1:30:48] why because they couldn't do anything on
[1:30:51] their own they were depending on God
[1:30:52] Amen and when God gave them conception
[1:30:55] they knew that it came from God and God
[1:30:57] got the credit
[1:31:02] when God was going to bring John the
[1:31:03] Baptist he used an old couple that was
[1:31:05] Pastor Prime
[1:31:07] Zechariah and Elizabeth who had never
[1:31:10] been able to conceive what was she was
[1:31:12] also barren
[1:31:13] what was he going to bring out of that
[1:31:14] he was going to bring the manifestation
[1:31:16] of his promised word out of a Barren
[1:31:18] womb
[1:31:20] this is the way God does it
[1:31:23] hey if we want to get anywhere the path
[1:31:25] Up Is Down
[1:31:30] when God was going to bring
[1:31:32] I think it's the great grandfather of
[1:31:34] Jesse
[1:31:36] we bring David
[1:31:37] he chose Rahab the Harlan
[1:31:40] and Rahab the Harlot and her husband
[1:31:42] founded Bethlehem
[1:31:44] where Jesus would be born
[1:31:46] what was the foundation Rahab the Harlot
[1:31:49] and her husband
[1:31:53] you know what
[1:31:54] Lucifer cannot work this way
[1:31:58] he cannot lower himself he cannot be
[1:32:00] humble he cannot look bad he cannot be
[1:32:03] abased
[1:32:09] when he chose to bring Christ he chose
[1:32:11] Mary of Nazareth
[1:32:14] of Nazareth
[1:32:16] nobody from nowhere
[1:32:19] is who he chose and what was she she was
[1:32:22] the Fulfillment of Isaiah chapter 7.
[1:32:24] the prophecy of Virgin shall conceive
[1:32:26] amen through her was going to come the
[1:32:28] prophecy from Genesis 3. amen what was
[1:32:31] she she was the word nobody knew who she
[1:32:32] was she was nobody she was a spouse to a
[1:32:34] man amen and she she had nothing to
[1:32:37] offer in herself she was a virgin amen
[1:32:40] she was predestinated to this position
[1:32:41] and the angel comes to her amen and and
[1:32:44] we know that Nazareth is a undesirable
[1:32:47] place
[1:32:48] why would God choose her from there
[1:32:51] he loves to do it that way when Jesus
[1:32:53] they called Jesus of Nazareth we know he
[1:32:55] was born in Bethlehem and the prophecy
[1:32:57] showed he had to come out of Bethlehem
[1:32:59] yet he resided most of his life in
[1:33:01] Nazareth and he was called Jesus of
[1:33:02] Nazareth why did God do it that way
[1:33:04] because can anything good come from
[1:33:06] Nazareth God was masking it and giving
[1:33:08] people an excuse to disbelieve
[1:33:12] they said that no Prophet comes from
[1:33:15] Nazareth well you know what he was born
[1:33:16] in Bethlehem according to the word he's
[1:33:18] exactly according to the word but God
[1:33:20] would have him live in Nazareth so he
[1:33:21] could get the name
[1:33:23] that dirty name that bad Association so
[1:33:26] that he can mask the truth amen so they
[1:33:28] can come through humility not through
[1:33:30] Pride
[1:33:35] why is it sometimes when God can make
[1:33:36] you look good he allows you to look bad
[1:33:42] maybe it's better for us if we look bad
[1:33:48] amen God is good
[1:33:51] when Jesus was on Calvary
[1:33:55] he was at the weakest
[1:33:57] amen when Satan was at his proudest
[1:34:01] moment
[1:34:02] when he was taking the life of this
[1:34:04] prophet he had turned all the tables
[1:34:06] seemingly he had routed the ministry he
[1:34:10] had changed the opinions of people he
[1:34:12] had got the governments amen together
[1:34:13] and now this great prophet that was
[1:34:16] doing damage to his kingdom is now amen
[1:34:18] hanging on a cross and now at this what
[1:34:21] appears to be Jesus's weakness weakest
[1:34:24] most humble humiliated State amen
[1:34:27] Lucifer is at his proudest moment and
[1:34:29] he's a b buzzing around the calvary
[1:34:32] with the Stinger of death amen and Jesus
[1:34:35] is laying there in absolute misery
[1:34:38] humiliation disrespect uh rejection as
[1:34:43] low as you could possibly go he's laying
[1:34:45] there that low what's he laying there
[1:34:47] for he's waiting for the pride of
[1:34:50] Lucifer to bring that Stinger of death
[1:34:52] and as soon as he stings that Stinger of
[1:34:54] death in and Jesus grabs a hold of him
[1:34:56] and says Ah I got you now
[1:34:58] what do you do he laid a trap through
[1:35:00] humility he laid a trap through
[1:35:02] Brokenness and he trapped the devil
[1:35:04] because the devil doesn't understand
[1:35:05] humility he only stands pride and
[1:35:07] arrogance
[1:35:09] it looked like it was the worst moment
[1:35:11] and it was the best moment it looked
[1:35:13] like it was defeat but it was victory
[1:35:16] when Samson loses everything loses his
[1:35:20] eyes has his hair chopped off loses his
[1:35:22] strength now he's grinding at the Mill
[1:35:24] he's absolutely defeated but when the
[1:35:26] enemy comes to his greatest moment of
[1:35:28] pride
[1:35:30] he's going to show off the great victory
[1:35:32] of the Gods of Dagon and the gods of the
[1:35:34] Philistines they bring Samson up out of
[1:35:37] the dungeon and lead him by a little
[1:35:38] child here he is blind here he's a
[1:35:40] Broken Man been grinding at the Mill in
[1:35:43] the dungeon amen and at his weakest
[1:35:45] moment when the when the enemy is
[1:35:47] mocking and all the thousands of the
[1:35:49] Lords and Ladies of the Philistines are
[1:35:51] gathered together amen all it is is a
[1:35:54] trap for the devil
[1:35:56] and he's gloating and he's proud and
[1:35:58] they're showing off they're making sport
[1:36:00] of Samson they're actually making fun of
[1:36:02] him and mocking him
[1:36:04] and not just him they're mocking the god
[1:36:07] of Israel
[1:36:09] and they're showing that our God our
[1:36:12] gods were more powerful than your God
[1:36:14] and overcame Samson
[1:36:18] so what does Samson do he asked the
[1:36:21] little boy to put his hands on the
[1:36:22] pillar
[1:36:24] and he lowers himself
[1:36:26] and humility
[1:36:29] and he repents
[1:36:32] he repents
[1:36:35] an absolute repentance and Brokenness
[1:36:38] he also surrenders his life
[1:36:41] and he said let me die with the
[1:36:44] Philistines
[1:36:45] now what's he going to do he's going to
[1:36:46] go as low as he possibly can go he can
[1:36:48] repent repent to God and say God just
[1:36:51] once more and he can bow down with all
[1:36:54] his might and push out those pillars and
[1:36:56] it became the house collapsed and killed
[1:36:59] them all and it became the greatest
[1:37:00] victory of Samson's life
[1:37:03] when did he win the greatest Victory
[1:37:05] when he got to the lowest that he could
[1:37:08] possibly go
[1:37:09] even giving up his own life
[1:37:12] that was the greatest victory
[1:37:14] and the Philistines were defeated their
[1:37:17] nation was just destroyed
[1:37:19] immediately
[1:37:23] the Way Up Is Down
[1:37:26] amen
[1:37:28] we're nothing
[1:37:30] praise God
[1:37:32] where does average people with average
[1:37:34] jobs
[1:37:35] some of us make average income some of
[1:37:38] us make below average income
[1:37:40] we drive average cars we live in average
[1:37:43] houses
[1:37:44] is that right
[1:37:46] we have no political connections we have
[1:37:48] no strength in ourselves we we can't
[1:37:51] make things happen we can't get things
[1:37:52] done
[1:37:54] I'm talking about the flesh side
[1:37:57] is that true
[1:38:00] but there's a secret power
[1:38:03] and that's Christ
[1:38:05] there's a secret that lies in the
[1:38:06] humility there's a secret behind the
[1:38:08] flesh
[1:38:09] and that's God and With God all things
[1:38:12] are possible
[1:38:16] I want to look for just a minute as we
[1:38:19] wind down and close I'm going to look at
[1:38:20] Mary
[1:38:22] Mary
[1:38:24] was just going one day to do what she
[1:38:28] did every day brother Ben said she was
[1:38:29] going to fetch water
[1:38:31] and she meets the angel Gabriel who
[1:38:33] begins to tell her her purpose in life
[1:38:35] and that she's highly favored and all of
[1:38:37] those things and naturally she has human
[1:38:40] questions how will this be knowing I
[1:38:41] know not a man
[1:38:43] and and I'm reading the story out of
[1:38:46] Luke
[1:38:47] chapter one
[1:38:49] but then she asked a question and the
[1:38:52] and the angel gives an answer
[1:38:54] and she says this in verse 38 and Mary
[1:38:57] said behold the handmaid of the Lord be
[1:38:59] it unto me according to Thy Word
[1:39:01] and the angel departed from her
[1:39:05] I think what's amazing
[1:39:07] is when she surrendered
[1:39:10] she actually surrendered a lot
[1:39:13] because when Mary Mary was a virgin a
[1:39:15] spouse to a man she had thoughts of her
[1:39:17] upcoming marriage she was going to be
[1:39:19] joined to Joseph and she had a future
[1:39:21] plan a future life she had lived in
[1:39:24] Nazareth she had kept her reputation
[1:39:26] suit she was a virgin the Bible says she
[1:39:28] was a virgin and and and and no man had
[1:39:31] known her
[1:39:32] she had a reputation
[1:39:35] but the minute that she yields to this
[1:39:38] conception
[1:39:39] her reputation's on the line
[1:39:42] the moment she says be it unto me
[1:39:44] according to your word now all of a
[1:39:47] sudden amen it's going to set up a
[1:39:50] sequence of events a scenario that is
[1:39:52] going to paint her in a bad light
[1:39:55] because now she's going to show up
[1:39:57] pregnant before she was married to
[1:39:59] Joseph amen and she's not going to be
[1:40:02] able to hide it for very long she's not
[1:40:04] going to be able to mask it amen and as
[1:40:06] she comes forth and she she shows up
[1:40:08] amen six months pregnant because for six
[1:40:11] months she went off with Elizabeth her
[1:40:13] cousin you talk about something looking
[1:40:15] fishy this looks really fishy this young
[1:40:17] girl who's a spouse to be married to
[1:40:19] this man who's a virgin she disappears
[1:40:21] from the from the city of Nazareth for
[1:40:23] six months and when she comes back she's
[1:40:25] six months pregnant
[1:40:26] and showing
[1:40:29] and what does everybody say
[1:40:31] oh Mary are you the Virgin from Isaiah 7
[1:40:41] no they start the rumor mill
[1:40:45] she went off and she did this and then
[1:40:48] it was rumored amen that Jesus was the
[1:40:51] product of her and a Roman soldier
[1:40:53] is that right
[1:40:55] and now she has to bear the consequences
[1:40:59] of this surrender
[1:41:02] she has to walk humiliated
[1:41:05] rejected
[1:41:07] who knows what her family said to her
[1:41:09] whether they accepted or didn't accept
[1:41:10] Joseph didn't believe her
[1:41:14] he was they were engaged to be married
[1:41:16] and Joseph didn't believe her until an
[1:41:18] angel met him and told him who this
[1:41:20] child was and then he stayed with her
[1:41:23] but he was going to put her away
[1:41:25] privately because he didn't believe her
[1:41:27] story if he didn't believe it who else
[1:41:29] didn't believe it
[1:41:31] and we only know of an Angel visiting
[1:41:33] one and that was Joseph so everybody
[1:41:35] else was left to their own imagination
[1:41:41] you know what
[1:41:44] there was nothing Mary could do to save
[1:41:47] her reputation
[1:41:50] she had no evidence
[1:41:52] she had no proof she was alone when the
[1:41:55] angel spoke to her
[1:41:57] she she she was gone from town for six
[1:42:01] months she comes back six months
[1:42:03] pregnant she there's no point in
[1:42:06] defending it when somebody says you've
[1:42:08] been a bad girl haven't you what's she
[1:42:09] gonna say uh
[1:42:13] who's going to believe her
[1:42:15] who's going to believe that she's still
[1:42:17] a virgin
[1:42:19] being six months pregnant
[1:42:21] there's not even any point in her
[1:42:23] defending herself
[1:42:24] there's no point in saying anything she
[1:42:26] knows what happened she knows
[1:42:30] who's whose Child is This she know what
[1:42:33] baby this is
[1:42:36] you know
[1:42:37] I was thinking and meditating on this
[1:42:39] and thinking even the birth of Jesus
[1:42:42] doesn't clear her name
[1:42:45] even Jesus being born doesn't vindicate
[1:42:48] that Mary was honorable and godly and
[1:42:51] virtuous
[1:42:52] her virtue has challenged her reputation
[1:42:55] is smeared her character is defamed amen
[1:42:58] and there's nothing that she can do to
[1:43:00] save it amen she just has to hold in her
[1:43:02] heart that she knows whose baby this is
[1:43:05] and Jesus is born and just because Jesus
[1:43:08] was now born and now she has a baby that
[1:43:10] doesn't clear up the rumors and the bad
[1:43:12] reputation and all of that
[1:43:15] she takes him to the temple when he's
[1:43:17] eight days old to be circumcised and to
[1:43:19] offer and pay the vow and when she takes
[1:43:21] him Amen brother Branham says all the
[1:43:24] women were pointing and whispering
[1:43:28] right pointing and whispering and saying
[1:43:30] and brother Adam dramatizes dramatizes
[1:43:32] all of this he says what they were
[1:43:34] saying I heard it was a Roman soldier
[1:43:36] and I heard this and they're all
[1:43:37] whispering and here Mary has to Stand
[1:43:40] Here amen poor with nothing standing in
[1:43:43] line knowing they're talking about here
[1:43:45] hearing the whisper seeing the points
[1:43:47] and knowing that they get silent every
[1:43:49] time she walks by knowing what's going
[1:43:51] on and there's nothing she can do but
[1:43:53] stand in line and wait to pay her vow
[1:43:57] oh praise God
[1:44:00] she can't defend herself she can't do
[1:44:03] any talking's not going to do any good
[1:44:06] we're going to believe anyways
[1:44:08] but oh God who's rich in Mercy
[1:44:11] when she finally gets up there in that
[1:44:13] line here comes Simeon
[1:44:16] Here Comes Simeon and he says oh I've
[1:44:19] seen in a I've been told by the Holy
[1:44:21] Ghost here he is and he lifts him up and
[1:44:23] I've seen the Lord's Christ and now I
[1:44:25] can die here comes Anna and Anna comes
[1:44:27] along and she begins to confirm the same
[1:44:29] thing and tell everybody else
[1:44:32] so that stopped all the rumors right
[1:44:36] no my friends
[1:44:38] they kept going because they picked
[1:44:40] those rumors up and they perpetuate him
[1:44:42] and they accused Jesus of being born a
[1:44:44] fornication later the Pharisees did
[1:44:45] those rumors kept going amen what God
[1:44:48] did through Simeon and Anna amen that
[1:44:50] was a blessing to Mary amen but it
[1:44:52] didn't change the opinions of the people
[1:44:55] it might have caused some to question or
[1:44:57] wonder but it didn't change she couldn't
[1:44:59] do anything to change the opinion even
[1:45:01] after Jesus started working miracles
[1:45:03] amen they just claimed that he did it
[1:45:04] because of the power of Beelzebub
[1:45:07] so even the Miracles even the sign of
[1:45:10] the Messiah it wasn't a Vindication of
[1:45:11] Mary and all of a sudden I began to
[1:45:13] realize Mary had to bear this reproach
[1:45:16] Amen to do what to be part of the word
[1:45:18] to manifest the word to have the word
[1:45:21] born from her she had to Bear a reproach
[1:45:23] and she couldn't do anything to take the
[1:45:26] reproach away nobody would believe her
[1:45:28] because it's an unbelievable story
[1:45:32] and we as the brine we have to bear the
[1:45:35] reproach amen all kinds of evil things
[1:45:37] are being said being spoken about the
[1:45:39] message we believe about the doctrines
[1:45:41] that we hold true about the messenger
[1:45:43] that God sent to our age amen there's
[1:45:45] there's all kinds of things circling the
[1:45:47] internet but there's nothing we can do
[1:45:49] about it
[1:45:51] there's no reason the first thing we do
[1:45:54] is make ourselves of no reputation
[1:45:56] if you're coming to Christ the first
[1:45:58] thing you can do is make yourself of no
[1:46:00] reputation and that way when they defame
[1:46:02] your reputation you don't have one
[1:46:03] anyways
[1:46:05] when they say you're ignorant you say
[1:46:07] you've got that right you only know the
[1:46:09] half of it buddy
[1:46:12] like they told Brother bam you don't
[1:46:14] even know your Bible he says
[1:46:17] he said that's true I can't pronounce
[1:46:19] pulpit
[1:46:21] that's true
[1:46:22] but I know the author really well
[1:46:27] you see there's no point we have to bear
[1:46:29] a reproach and that reproach may get
[1:46:31] worse
[1:46:33] there's nothing you can say
[1:46:36] I mean how many times have you tried to
[1:46:37] convince somebody that you haven't
[1:46:39] followed a false prophet
[1:46:40] did they believe you
[1:46:44] I had so many discussions with my family
[1:46:46] I mean so many discussions
[1:46:48] it didn't change anything
[1:46:52] we have to make ourselves of no
[1:46:53] reputation
[1:46:55] and then take on the form of a servant
[1:46:58] what did Mary do the first thing she did
[1:47:00] was give up her reputation as a clean
[1:47:02] living virgin
[1:47:04] said be it unto me according to your
[1:47:06] word she gave up a reputation and she
[1:47:08] said behold the hand man of the Lord she
[1:47:11] was now the Lord's servant
[1:47:13] oh I thank God if we're going to Walk
[1:47:16] This Way the first thing we need to do
[1:47:18] is make ourselves of no reputation
[1:47:21] if they call you whatever they call you
[1:47:23] amen they're going to call it nothing
[1:47:25] you can say in rebuttal is going to
[1:47:27] change anybody's mind so there's no
[1:47:28] point in speaking
[1:47:31] you know I I was amazed when I began to
[1:47:34] hear uh some brothers I know in Africa
[1:47:38] they sent me a a message from a brother
[1:47:41] who had preached the message I don't
[1:47:43] remember how long decades like 40 years
[1:47:44] he left the message
[1:47:47] and now he's coming against it and he's
[1:47:49] claiming he's going to get the
[1:47:50] government involved on for religious
[1:47:52] matters and any any starts claiming
[1:47:56] terrible things about brother Brenham
[1:47:58] he's a liar
[1:48:00] he he did all of these things wrong and
[1:48:03] he's got all this sin in his life and he
[1:48:05] covered this up and he hid this and all
[1:48:06] this other stuff
[1:48:08] and I started thinking huh isn't that
[1:48:10] interesting
[1:48:12] isn't that amazing
[1:48:14] that the first thing you do when you
[1:48:15] leave the message is you have to defame
[1:48:18] the character of brother Branham and you
[1:48:19] have to make him evil you have to make
[1:48:21] him Wicked you have to make him a liar
[1:48:24] and you have to make him a Deceiver
[1:48:27] and I started wondering why
[1:48:29] why
[1:48:30] because we some of these men were the
[1:48:32] same men who were propping up brother
[1:48:34] Brandon calling him wonderful calling
[1:48:36] him
[1:48:37] God's messenger
[1:48:39] is that right
[1:48:41] he was a wonderful messenger he was the
[1:48:43] man of the eighth he was the seventh
[1:48:44] angel and they were the ones spreading
[1:48:46] the message they were the ones
[1:48:48] convincing other people is true they
[1:48:49] were the ones baptizing in Jesus name
[1:48:51] they were the ones preaching the message
[1:48:53] they were the ones spreading it to the
[1:48:55] people they spread it to brother Branham
[1:48:57] never spread it they did
[1:49:01] they are the ones who convinced the
[1:49:03] people they're the ones who preached the
[1:49:04] message they're the ones who baptized
[1:49:06] the people they not brother Brenham they
[1:49:09] and they never come out and say I did
[1:49:12] wrong I I baptized you wrong no no what
[1:49:15] are they doing I realized they never
[1:49:18] became of no reputation
[1:49:20] now what's happening when people start
[1:49:22] finding evidence and it looks like this
[1:49:24] and brother bam did this and did that
[1:49:26] and all of a sudden people start
[1:49:27] pretending this this evidence to these
[1:49:29] men these men start to distance himself
[1:49:31] from the message and Heap all of their
[1:49:33] own failure on brother Branham to what
[1:49:36] protect their own reputation
[1:49:38] they say it's not my fault he deceived
[1:49:41] me
[1:49:42] he's the liar he's the deceiver he's the
[1:49:45] charlatan it's his fault it's not my
[1:49:47] fault
[1:49:50] I said oh
[1:49:51] this is the devil
[1:49:54] this is exactly what he does
[1:49:57] because amen because when a man repents
[1:49:59] amen truly repents he says I did I did I
[1:50:04] did I did my fault I taught I convinced
[1:50:07] I'm sorry
[1:50:09] yes yeah
[1:50:11] but the devil says he did he did
[1:50:15] he did
[1:50:17] why to protect a reputation
[1:50:23] I said God let me have no reputation let
[1:50:27] me have nothing to protect and nobody
[1:50:29] that I have to point to when I fail I
[1:50:31] fail
[1:50:33] amen and if there's any success in my
[1:50:36] life God did it
[1:50:38] if there's any failure in my life I did
[1:50:40] it
[1:50:41] amen help us to lose our reputation and
[1:50:45] take on the form of a servant and not
[1:50:47] have to defend ourselves and not have to
[1:50:48] prove anything amen and be able just to
[1:50:51] March forward and say listen I didn't I
[1:50:54] didn't come up with the message
[1:50:56] I didn't invent it it's not my invention
[1:50:59] it's God's
[1:51:01] I didn't write the Bible the way it's
[1:51:02] written God did
[1:51:05] I didn't say amen I didn't say that in
[1:51:09] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:51:10] angel the mystery of God will be
[1:51:11] finished God said that I didn't say it
[1:51:13] God said it
[1:51:15] I don't have to defend it because it's
[1:51:16] not my word it's not my reputation on
[1:51:19] the line I have no reputation
[1:51:22] amen
[1:51:23] I'm not the one who Vindicated the
[1:51:25] prophet God did
[1:51:27] I'm not the one who turned my back to
[1:51:29] the crowd God God did amen I don't I
[1:51:32] don't have to protect myself
[1:51:35] I didn't invent this
[1:51:37] God did I just believe it
[1:51:40] I believe it and I'm not ashamed of it
[1:51:42] and I'm ashamed to stay with it by the
[1:51:45] grace of God I'm not ashamed I'm proud
[1:51:47] I'm thankful
[1:51:49] to be associated with the message
[1:51:52] right I I don't want to have to defend
[1:51:55] my reputation
[1:51:56] you know people start up websites and
[1:51:59] you know this happened in this wrong and
[1:52:01] this and
[1:52:02] listen don't waste one second typing out
[1:52:05] a comment
[1:52:09] you just go oh that's wrong they got
[1:52:11] that wrong that didn't even happen tick
[1:52:13] tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick
[1:52:16] what do you think when you post that
[1:52:17] comment everybody's gonna be like oh I'm
[1:52:19] so sorry we had it wrong
[1:52:22] you were right
[1:52:25] we had
[1:52:27] just be of no reputation
[1:52:30] this is God's message
[1:52:33] this was God's Prophet this is God's
[1:52:36] word
[1:52:37] I believe it and I stand by it and I
[1:52:39] want to be part of it with everything
[1:52:40] that's in me
[1:52:42] but I don't have to defend it Mary
[1:52:44] didn't have to defend herself Mary
[1:52:46] didn't have to make herself pregnant
[1:52:47] Mary didn't have to do all she had to do
[1:52:49] was believe the word and surrender to it
[1:52:53] so I started thinking of what was Mary's
[1:52:56] vindication
[1:53:00] the birth wasn't the Vindication the
[1:53:01] Miracles went to vindication
[1:53:04] but for me this is just me
[1:53:06] I think the resurrection was her
[1:53:08] vindication
[1:53:11] if he would have stayed in the grave she
[1:53:13] would have been a liar
[1:53:17] but when he came out of that grave amen
[1:53:20] Mary was Vindicated whether anybody
[1:53:22] accepted it or believe it or not most of
[1:53:23] them didn't but it was still Mary's
[1:53:25] vindication
[1:53:27] and you know what we we believe this
[1:53:29] message We Believe It's The End Time
[1:53:31] message we believe that it's going to
[1:53:32] bring a rapture we believe that the
[1:53:34] sleeping Saints are going to come out of
[1:53:35] the ground amen but I have no way to
[1:53:37] vindicate myself and prove that any of
[1:53:39] that is right
[1:53:40] amen but you know what's going to be our
[1:53:42] Vindication the resurrection of the Dead
[1:53:44] is going to be our Vindication the
[1:53:46] change of the body is going to be our
[1:53:48] Vindication amen that's going to
[1:53:49] vindicate that this message is true and
[1:53:52] I can't control that I can't do anything
[1:53:54] but surrender surrender surrender and
[1:53:56] say beat unto me according to Thy word
[1:53:59] until that time I must be of no
[1:54:02] reputation and let God prove what's
[1:54:04] what's what
[1:54:08] amen
[1:54:11] you're just this and you're just that
[1:54:13] that's fine
[1:54:15] God will prove who's who
[1:54:18] God will prove who's who
[1:54:20] sometimes the people that were the
[1:54:22] strongest the boldest the firmest
[1:54:23] they've already walked away
[1:54:28] sometimes we try to prove with harsh
[1:54:30] speech and firm comments and that we're
[1:54:33] real believers
[1:54:35] the reality is time will tell
[1:54:38] the real truth of it is
[1:54:40] because the people walked away thought
[1:54:42] they were Believers at one point
[1:54:44] the truth is time will tell
[1:54:46] everything will be manifest in due
[1:54:48] season whether you're legit or not
[1:54:52] you're not going to prove it by your
[1:54:53] firm speech you're not going to prove it
[1:54:55] by how firmly you say and how many times
[1:54:58] you declare and we've heard all of that
[1:54:59] before
[1:55:02] all I can do is stay true and stay
[1:55:04] surrendered and stay submissive lose my
[1:55:07] reputation take on the form of a servant
[1:55:09] humble myself and obey
[1:55:11] and God will vindicate when it's time
[1:55:13] for him to vindicate I've got nothing to
[1:55:17] prove to nobody my reputation is in his
[1:55:20] hands
[1:55:21] I've placed all my reputation my honor
[1:55:25] amen people may believe that you've
[1:55:28] accepted doctrines of devils you you we
[1:55:30] believe we've taken the seed of Christ
[1:55:33] we believe we're impregnated by the word
[1:55:36] others believe we're impregnated by
[1:55:38] doctrines of devils
[1:55:40] what are you gonna what are you gonna do
[1:55:42] to prove it
[1:55:45] what are you going to do to prove it you
[1:55:47] don't do anything to prove it you stay
[1:55:48] true God will prove it
[1:55:50] God will back up his word God will
[1:55:52] vindicate it God there's nothing for us
[1:55:55] to do but stay true to him and let him
[1:55:57] stay true to his word
[1:56:00] if not we're going to get sucked into
[1:56:01] all kinds of nonsense that we don't need
[1:56:03] to be part of
[1:56:05] amen
[1:56:07] first I want to lose my reputation
[1:56:11] then I want to take on the form of a
[1:56:13] servant humble myself and obey
[1:56:19] God help me and may that in my life open
[1:56:22] doors and channels of redemption to
[1:56:26] everyone else around me
[1:56:28] amen
[1:56:30] you know Ruth
[1:56:32] she had to go lay herself at boaz's feet
[1:56:36] you know Naomi's the one who told her
[1:56:38] what to do because Naomi represents the
[1:56:40] old church or the Old Testament
[1:56:41] represents the word
[1:56:43] and Naomi gave her the instructions this
[1:56:45] is how you do here's the law of
[1:56:46] redemption this is how you go to him
[1:56:48] so she did in obedience she surrendered
[1:56:50] herself in obedience to Naomi and she
[1:56:52] went and she went
[1:56:54] at midnight when the man laid down by
[1:56:58] himself
[1:57:00] everything about this looks bad
[1:57:03] here you have a man all by himself in
[1:57:05] the Midnight Hour now you have a woman
[1:57:07] all by herself who slips in she uncovers
[1:57:10] his feet She lays at his feet and She
[1:57:12] lays down there waiting and somewhere
[1:57:14] Amen in the middle of the night he wakes
[1:57:15] up scared and he says who are you and
[1:57:18] she says I am Ruth thine handmade here
[1:57:22] she's already laying there as a servant
[1:57:27] and she says you're in near Kinsman
[1:57:29] cover me with your skirt what's she
[1:57:31] saying would you marry me
[1:57:34] she's saying would you marry me and
[1:57:36] right away Boaz recognizes the purity of
[1:57:39] her heart the intention of redemption
[1:57:41] the desire to see Redemption come back
[1:57:43] and he says you're you're more righteous
[1:57:46] you're better you're Kinder in the end
[1:57:47] than you were in the beginning because
[1:57:49] you didn't seek after young men whether
[1:57:51] rich or poor amen you're coming for
[1:57:53] Redemption you're not coming for lust
[1:57:55] you're coming Amen to for others you're
[1:57:57] not coming for yourself
[1:57:59] Jesus and when he recognized that amen
[1:58:02] he says amen lay here and in the morning
[1:58:04] he says now depart before anybody can
[1:58:06] know that a woman was in the threshing
[1:58:08] floor because why it would look terrible
[1:58:10] it would ruin her reputation amen
[1:58:13] it'd make her look like a harlot amen
[1:58:15] and he says the whole the whole village
[1:58:17] the whole town knows you're a virtuous
[1:58:18] woman she had a reputation
[1:58:21] she had a reputation everyone knew she
[1:58:24] was a virtuous woman but she was putting
[1:58:26] that reputation on the line when she
[1:58:28] slipped in there at night according to
[1:58:30] the word and laid herself down for
[1:58:32] Redemption purposes amen she put her
[1:58:35] entire reputation on the line because if
[1:58:37] a Boaz had misunderstood her intentions
[1:58:39] and he had sounded the alarm she would
[1:58:41] be labeled as a harlot the rest of her
[1:58:43] life
[1:58:46] and there would be nothing she could do
[1:58:48] to defend herself
[1:58:51] when when Ruth
[1:58:54] you know brother Brown's so good at
[1:58:56] dramatizing but if you allow me the
[1:58:58] allowance to dramatize us for a minute
[1:59:01] when Ruth had done
[1:59:03] all that the word had told her all that
[1:59:05] Naomi had told her to do the approach
[1:59:07] she knew the approach now to him she
[1:59:10] knew how Redemption Works she knew where
[1:59:12] she had to go and and and she comes at
[1:59:16] night and she's waiting at night I I
[1:59:19] just wonder what that waiting was like
[1:59:22] I wonder if she questions should I go
[1:59:25] through this should I do this what if he
[1:59:26] misunderstands what if he says this what
[1:59:28] if somebody else Finds Me
[1:59:31] I just wonder
[1:59:33] what her waiting was like as she stood
[1:59:36] there and then she sees him go and he
[1:59:38] lies himself down by the Heap of corn
[1:59:40] and it's amazing Amen in the evening
[1:59:42] time at the setting of The Sun where
[1:59:45] does she find Boaz she finds him where
[1:59:46] all the word is
[1:59:48] and the fullness of the word is where
[1:59:50] he's laying
[1:59:51] where do we find him in the evening time
[1:59:53] at the end of the Harvest we find him at
[1:59:55] the fullness of the word
[1:59:57] so we are Ruth
[2:00:00] and now she's she's standing here and
[2:00:02] maybe he's asleep now everybody else is
[2:00:05] asleep this is a good time when when she
[2:00:08] goes to step forward
[2:00:10] Ruth finally comes to a point
[2:00:13] Where It's All or Nothing
[2:00:17] she finally gets to the point
[2:00:19] where she could back out she could abort
[2:00:23] she could jump ship she could save her
[2:00:25] reputation she could save the risk of
[2:00:27] looking bad everybody knows she's a
[2:00:29] virtuous woman but but if this goes
[2:00:32] wrong it goes very wrong
[2:00:34] if this goes wrong she's labeled as a
[2:00:37] harlot if this goes wrong her reputation
[2:00:39] is ruined if this goes wrong nobody in
[2:00:41] the village will speak to her the same
[2:00:43] way again she's ruined amen so she's
[2:00:45] getting ready to take an action that's
[2:00:47] either going to bring her to Redemption
[2:00:49] to be married to the lord of the Harvest
[2:00:51] or bring her a reputation as a harlot
[2:00:53] and an outcast for the rest of her life
[2:00:56] this is where Ruth is at
[2:00:58] and she's standing here at this point
[2:01:00] and everyone's asleep and he's asleep
[2:01:02] and Now's the Time
[2:01:05] and she's got to make her choice and
[2:01:07] when she makes her choice there's a
[2:01:08] point that she crosses the point of no
[2:01:10] return
[2:01:12] when she makes up her mind she's got to
[2:01:14] go all the way amen because if she
[2:01:16] doesn't go all the way and she doesn't
[2:01:18] go to the right place and she doesn't
[2:01:20] ask for Redemption amen the whole thing
[2:01:22] should fall apart so in in my mind this
[2:01:24] is just the way I would do it this is
[2:01:26] the way I Envision it when she made up
[2:01:27] her mind amen all of a sudden she's got
[2:01:29] to move quickly now amen I've got to go
[2:01:31] now I can't back out I can't I can't and
[2:01:34] she moves quickly in uncovers and lays
[2:01:36] herself down
[2:01:39] now I don't know what the period of time
[2:01:41] was before she got there
[2:01:43] and Boaz woke up
[2:01:46] can you imagine what that was like
[2:01:51] but when he woke up
[2:01:53] he stirred and said who are you and she
[2:01:55] said and we know the dialogue
[2:01:57] this is the point she's either going to
[2:02:00] be accepted or rejected her life is
[2:02:03] either over or it's made she's either
[2:02:06] brought into redemption or she's an
[2:02:08] outcast of society
[2:02:11] and here she comes to the point and Boaz
[2:02:14] says I'll do all that you require
[2:02:19] and all of a sudden she was sealed now
[2:02:22] her reputation is in boaz's hands
[2:02:25] Boaz is holding her reputation Boaz is
[2:02:28] the only one that can declare her
[2:02:32] virtuous
[2:02:33] because he was alone with her on the
[2:02:36] threshing floor he is the one who
[2:02:39] redeems her and protects her integrity
[2:02:40] and defends her and he goes to pay the
[2:02:43] price of redemption and takes her to
[2:02:44] himself and raises up seed declaring
[2:02:47] that she is virtuous she is righteous it
[2:02:50] wasn't in her hands anymore she had
[2:02:52] given when she was living clean it was
[2:02:54] in her hands
[2:02:55] when she kept herself above reproach it
[2:02:57] was in her hands all of her virtue was
[2:02:59] in her hands as soon as she laid down at
[2:03:01] boaz's feet her virtue she handed right
[2:03:03] into Boaz and now Boaz was holding her
[2:03:06] virtue
[2:03:08] listen when we come to this message it's
[2:03:11] got to be all or nothing
[2:03:13] it's either all the way right or it's
[2:03:16] all the way wrong
[2:03:18] you're either brought into redemption or
[2:03:20] you're an outcast in religious Society
[2:03:23] that's just the way it is
[2:03:25] it's too different this isn't this isn't
[2:03:28] another Christian idea this is so far
[2:03:31] away from that friends this isn't
[2:03:34] another denomination we're coming in
[2:03:36] contact with the very Redeemer himself
[2:03:37] the lord of the Harvest the one who can
[2:03:39] bring Redemption
[2:03:41] and we're coming to a place the word is
[2:03:43] showing us the approach but when she
[2:03:44] laid down there at her feet she gave
[2:03:46] herself completely to Boaz now whatever
[2:03:48] Boaz does is what her life is if he cast
[2:03:51] her away she's a Castaway if she accepts
[2:03:53] her she's accepted but she's come to his
[2:03:55] feet and now every her whole life is in
[2:03:57] his hands
[2:04:01] that's how I want to come to this
[2:04:03] message that's how I've come to this
[2:04:04] message
[2:04:05] with my eyes wide open recognizing that
[2:04:08] if I step to that threshing floor and if
[2:04:10] I Lay My down and myself at that feet
[2:04:12] this is the point of no return
[2:04:16] I
[2:04:17] have nobody else to blame
[2:04:20] I have no one else to save my reputation
[2:04:23] I have no more reputation to save
[2:04:26] I've given myself to Christ
[2:04:28] I trust it's him I believe it's him he's
[2:04:31] revealed it to me and I've given myself
[2:04:33] holy to him
[2:04:35] now my reputation my virtue
[2:04:39] my everything is in his hands
[2:04:43] now it's up to him to vindicate
[2:04:46] all right
[2:04:48] and I believe you will
[2:04:51] what's going to be my Vindication I can
[2:04:53] make all kinds of claims I can say this
[2:04:55] I've got a revelation I see this the
[2:04:57] Bible I can claim all of that but one
[2:05:00] thing for sure is going to vindicate me
[2:05:01] is when these atoms change I am
[2:05:03] Vindicated when I'm moving a Rapture
[2:05:06] amen and move Beyond this Dimension into
[2:05:08] another dimension amen and go to the
[2:05:10] marriage supper I have been thoroughly
[2:05:12] Vindicated and he's held my reputation
[2:05:14] in honor
[2:05:16] proving by that
[2:05:18] that I was virtuous
[2:05:20] my virtues not in my hands my virtues in
[2:05:24] his hands for I've given myself to him
[2:05:26] and I trust that he will do all that he
[2:05:29] said he will do
[2:05:30] amen let's stand
[2:05:34] amen
[2:05:39] I encourage you
[2:05:42] this isn't a halfway deal
[2:05:47] this isn't
[2:05:49] something that we just try out
[2:05:52] this is Jesus Christ
[2:05:54] the lord of the Harvest
[2:05:57] this is the one who has Redemption and
[2:06:00] can redeem us and we're coming to him
[2:06:02] and laying ourselves at his feet
[2:06:06] listen when
[2:06:08] when our reputation starts to get on the
[2:06:10] line
[2:06:11] and we start to back up from the message
[2:06:13] to save our reputation
[2:06:15] that just shows we haven't died yet
[2:06:19] as it shows we we haven't fully
[2:06:21] surrendered because when you fully
[2:06:23] surrender now you come like Mary
[2:06:26] there's nothing I can say
[2:06:28] you believe in serpent seed
[2:06:30] yes
[2:06:33] you believe that you believe God sent a
[2:06:35] problem yes
[2:06:36] you believe that there's just the only
[2:06:38] the elect yes do you believe that yes
[2:06:42] I believe all of that and I can't defend
[2:06:44] myself I believe it
[2:06:46] it's the truth for me
[2:06:48] it's the absolute truth I know it's the
[2:06:50] truth and I can't do anything to defend
[2:06:52] myself and say well you know there's no
[2:06:55] well it's the truth
[2:06:57] and you believe you're one of them yes
[2:06:59] by God's grace I believe I'm one of them
[2:07:01] well I don't believe you are well I
[2:07:03] can't make you believe that I am
[2:07:06] it's by the grace of God I've already
[2:07:07] given my life away
[2:07:09] I have nothing more to prove
[2:07:12] it's up to my husband now
[2:07:15] to hold my virtue and honor it's up to
[2:07:17] him
[2:07:18] to prove
[2:07:19] I've given my life away
[2:07:22] how many want to have no reputation
[2:07:25] that's a hard request
[2:07:27] it's going to take the grace of God in
[2:07:28] our lives
[2:07:29] I want to have nothing to defend I want
[2:07:31] to have no argument
[2:07:33] I want to have no comeback I just want
[2:07:36] to believe the word and I want it to
[2:07:37] manifest in me
[2:07:39] I want to have no reputation and now I
[2:07:41] want to take on the form of a servant
[2:07:43] and humble myself
[2:07:48] that's Christ unlocked Redemption that's
[2:07:51] how Mary moved forward in Redemption
[2:07:53] that's how Ruth moved forward in
[2:07:55] Redemption that's how we can move
[2:07:57] forward in Redemption
[2:07:59] and let's bow our heads together
[2:08:03] dear Lord Jesus we thank you God for
[2:08:05] your word

[2:09:14] through us
[2:09:15] for God it was Mary that you needed you
[2:09:19] needed her to bring forth that child
[2:09:22] thought it was Ruth that you needed you
[2:09:24] needed her to bring forth that child for
[2:09:26] Redemption and God you need a woman in
[2:09:29] this end time to bring forth a child of
[2:09:31] the word
[2:09:32] the Manifest Redemption
