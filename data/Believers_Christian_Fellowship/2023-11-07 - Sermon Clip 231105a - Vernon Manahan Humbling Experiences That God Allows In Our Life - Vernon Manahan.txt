TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the next years that happened in the next few years uh he was attending a church and he became eventually he became a preacher from a boxer to a preacher all right and if your pastor is a is a former boxer and you know people will just obey the pastor right okay so so here is George foran now then he he said it it took a humbling experience for him to know the Lord without because he was so full of Pride he was popular he had this reputation of being a good boxer and God has to strip everything away amen it took a humbling experience for him and so when he did that when that thing happened to him he started serving the lord he became a preacher and many years later we'd go back to the ring and and fight and God uh uh allowed him I don't know what uh if that is good or not but I mean he allowed him to be Champion again at the age of 45 and there was a part of his testimony he said when he was young he will he will fight and try to finish the game for the first two rounds but when he got older in This heavyweight championship that was that happened in 1994 he said he was he had a lot of patience he was waiting and waiting and waiting he was he was telling the and the testimony in one of the churches and he was waiting and waiting and waiting not unlike when he was younger that he was he always he was so aggressive but this time he's waiting and waiting waiting for the right time and then when he he saw the right time and then bum ented a knockout he became the oldest heavyweight champion of the world at the age of 45 now I while I was looking at it you we can apply that in our spiritual life When We Were Young we are so aggressive we think that that we can do so many things according to our abilities according to our intellect according to what we want but when we get older in serving the lord we learn to wait we we learn to wait on God we learn to wait for God there's a timing and we realize that it's not our sufficiency God is our sufficiency the only way with that we can we can we can accomplish anything even in I'm a minister for for 25 years years uh when I was young I thought that I could I've been accomplishing things for the Lord but then I realized that as I got older without the grace of God without his leading without his anointing without his inspiration nobody can be blessed in the ministry that the Lord has entrusted me and every time I think that the people are blessed in the word that I preach they are not blessed but every time that I feel that I did not do my job well somebody will approach you and they will say that they were blessed and you know that you know that it was not you because you know in yourself that you you're not even sure of what you were preaching and so this this this testimony this humbling experience that the Lord gives us it is part of our learning in life amen
