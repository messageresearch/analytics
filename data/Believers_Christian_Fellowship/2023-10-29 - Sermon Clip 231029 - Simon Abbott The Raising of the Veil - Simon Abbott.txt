TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now the Mysteries should be finished including the mystery of who she is okay including the mystery of her position in Christ and if we notice it's truly only the last handful of years that that we that that we've realized actually the revelation of who she is and what it means you know he's broken forth and we that brother R said these things but it it wasn't clear to us it wasn't clear to me but like the mirror on the wall that mirror has been there since' 65 the mirror okay but I was kind of still pulling my ear I don't you I was pulling and I was waving and it took that certain amount of time for us to realize whoa actually can this be can it be you know just sometimes it's just so to too much you know we we've walking down the aisle and we've come right down to the front here and don't forget just break it it to you gently Jack you can't walk further than here this is the furthest you can get without taking another name see what I mean you can walk as far as the altar the only way out is to go back out that way and you're carrying a new name that's where we are it's awesome and we're carrying his name his name so as we get down to the altar now we're starting to realize who we are suddenly now we can see clearly and the bride's identity is being unveiled I mean think of it 20 years ago I don't know you I we traveled a lot so we heard a lot of preaching but we would hear like oh your bride your bride your bride you know everything's fine but nobody kind of knew what it meant you know but we way up the aisle somewhere and he was just like oh well everything's fine and the the veil was kind of swinging and all we knew was your bride your bride your bride but 20 years ago it wasn't time cuz we were still up there we weren't down here and so the unveiling of the Bride it has to happen right before the Rapture it has to because don't forget the Rapture happens after the marriage takes place because the marriage supper follows the marriage we go to the marriage supper and don't forget the veil is only lifted when she's married when the vows have been given yeah then the veil is lifted
