[18:36] that we say and do in Jesus Christ's
[18:39] name we pray
[18:40] amen
[18:42] man God bless you we're going to have
[18:43] you take your seats for just a moment
[18:45] thank you musicians
[18:48] amen we've had a bit of a busy morning
[18:50] amen we have some baptisms lined up this
[18:53] morning and we already had a baptism
[18:56] lined up brother Josiah priests is
[18:58] desired to be re-baptized in the name of
[19:00] the Lord Jesus Christ and I'll tell you
[19:03] about that in just a moment and um so we
[19:06] were planning on doing that today and I
[19:08] believe it was yesterday or Friday I
[19:10] don't remember which day I was talking
[19:12] with brother Levi and brother Levi Yoder
[19:15] and his family are here God bless you
[19:16] brother Levi and he brought you know a
[19:18] car full of guests with him
[19:20] and uh we were talking and he says
[19:22] there's somebody here I'm talking to
[19:24] that is interested in possibly getting
[19:26] baptized will you be set up for baptism
[19:28] on Sunday I said yes we will praise the
[19:31] lord it's already in the works God's
[19:33] already working so I thank God that he
[19:35] he was able to do that so there's
[19:37] actually three individuals that have
[19:39] come with brother Levi that would like
[19:40] to be baptized in the name of the Lord
[19:42] Jesus Christ amen so we're so thankful
[19:45] God is moving and God is working and God
[19:48] is finding his children and drawing them
[19:50] amen and Levi's been witnessing to him
[19:52] about them about water baptism and their
[19:55] Andy Byler and that name may sound
[19:58] familiar because Andy Byler is the
[20:00] father of Daniel Byler and Daniel Byler
[20:03] as part of the group in Junction City
[20:05] who was baptized with the 17 that got
[20:08] baptized at once and his father Andy was
[20:11] there when Kyle baptized brother Jesse
[20:13] that time and so God is working and
[20:17] Brother Andy told me that God pricked
[20:18] his heart then amen so God is moving
[20:21] amen we're so thankful and then there's
[20:24] a sister Amina schwarzen struber and a
[20:26] brother Robert wagler so we'll be happy
[20:28] to baptize them in the name of the Lord
[20:30] Jesus Christ at the end of this service
[20:32] amen you know we had a little bit of a
[20:34] busy morning I wanted to go back and
[20:36] meet with them and talk to them and
[20:37] appreciate your patience as I've ran
[20:40] around amen
[20:42] God is good but we want to say welcome
[20:45] to all the visitors that hear Brother
[20:46] Arley stutzman God bless you it's good
[20:48] to have you back with us again and
[20:49] everybody else is visiting if you're a
[20:51] visitor God bless you you're welcome and

[21:09] when you come to church amen God always
[21:12] is moving God is always working and I'm
[21:14] so thankful for that amen I love to see
[21:17] God finding his sheep
[21:19] and drawing them to himself it's so
[21:22] exciting there's something fresh and
[21:23] rejuvenating about it for all of us amen
[21:27] I also want to remind you that I will be
[21:30] leaving brother Jonathan baumgarner and
[21:31] I will be leaving this Thursday to head
[21:33] to Europe we'll be going to Poland for
[21:35] meetings and then to Romania for a
[21:37] family camp and while I'm gone uh the
[21:40] Ministry schedule will be the first
[21:42] Sunday which is July 23rd brother John
[21:44] Kadeem is coming to preach for us so
[21:46] it's exciting to have him back I'm
[21:48] hoping he can give a testimony and an
[21:50] update on what God is doing for them and
[21:52] the start of that church man God has
[21:54] certainly been blessing them and then
[21:56] Wednesday will be Brother Kyle he'll be

[22:13] of a heads up what he's doing there
[22:15] letting you know kind of the schedule so
[22:17] we can be praying for him in that trip
[22:19] so there's a lot happening amen and God
[22:22] is good

[22:26] to be part of a living God a living
[22:29] moving God who's moving and doing and
[22:32] drawing and calling and changing us and
[22:35] growing us and molding us into his image
[22:38] it's exciting
[22:40] amen I want to take just a moment and
[22:43] talk about uh brother Josiah priest
[22:47] re-baptism because I want to do a little
[22:48] bit of teaching before we go into that
[22:50] and before I get into the sermon that I
[22:52] want to get into but if you could turn
[22:54] with me to the book of Acts
[22:56] I'm going to read one scripture together
[22:58] one that we're very very familiar with
[23:01] Acts chapter 2
[23:05] verse 37 Acts chapter 2 verse 37.
[23:14] says now when they heard this they were
[23:16] pricked in their heart
[23:18] and said unto Peter and to the rest of
[23:19] the Apostles men and Brethren what shall
[23:21] we do then Peter said unto them repent
[23:24] and be baptized every one of you in the
[23:25] name of Jesus Christ for their mission
[23:27] of sins and you shall receive the gift
[23:29] of the Holy Ghost for this promises unto
[23:32] you and to your children and to all that
[23:34] are afar off even as many as the Lord
[23:36] Our God shall call
[23:38] amen uh brother Josiah and I have been
[23:41] talking he came to me uh several weeks
[23:43] ago and we he discussed his desire to be
[23:46] baptized again in the name of the Lord
[23:47] Jesus Christ and I talked to him and I
[23:51] found that his reasoning his desire was
[23:53] was good he has a wonderful desire he
[23:56] knows that he's not required to be
[23:58] re-baptized he was baptized in the name
[24:00] of the Lord Jesus Christ as a boy amen
[24:03] but but there's something that's in his
[24:05] conscience that he wants clear amen he
[24:07] wants to know that he's on a good
[24:08] foundation and when he talked to me he
[24:11] understands where he is scripturally he
[24:12] understands he's not required but this
[24:14] is for conscience sake and I say God
[24:16] bless you amen I'm happy to do it he
[24:19] wants to know that his foundation is
[24:21] solid and I say God bless you
[24:23] and so because of that I wanted to just
[24:26] go over uh re-baptism
[24:28] and then there's two forms of rebaptism
[24:30] there's a re-baptism because we were not
[24:32] baptized scripturally
[24:34] and many of us have received rebaptism
[24:37] because we weren't baptized in the name
[24:38] of the Lord Jesus Christ how many of you
[24:40] were re-baptized because your first
[24:42] baptism was not scriptural amen so
[24:45] that's one rebaptized re-baptism but in
[24:48] this case our brother received
[24:49] scriptural baptism the correct way but
[24:52] he desires to be baptized again and so
[24:55] brother Branham got this question and
[24:57] questions and answers in 1954 so I want
[24:59] to go over him
[25:00] the question was I was baptized at the
[25:03] age of 13 should I be again
[25:06] and and there's this is a long answer
[25:09] but I'm going to pull some excerpts out
[25:10] of his answer he says if you've been a
[25:13] Christian all along since she was 13
[25:15] years old a believer in Christ I just
[25:17] remain like you are I wouldn't now if
[25:19] God has blessed you give you the Holy
[25:20] Spirit since then
[25:22] and the baptism is only a form it's just
[25:25] to show the world or the congregation
[25:27] that you're with at the time that you
[25:29] before Witnesses prove that you have
[25:31] believed that God sent his son and he
[25:33] died and rose again on the third day and
[25:35] he was buried into him and have risen to
[25:37] walk a newness of life and them same
[25:40] people that watched you when you was
[25:41] baptized will meet you at the Judgment
[25:43] scene so he's saying that that baptism
[25:46] is a witness to that congregation or
[25:49] wherever you're at that you have have
[25:51] believed in the Lord Jesus Christ that
[25:54] you believe amen that I'll read it again
[25:56] that you believe that God sent his son
[25:59] and and he died and rose again the third
[26:01] day and he was buried into him and have
[26:03] risen to walk in newness of life amen
[26:05] that's what you testify when you take
[26:07] water baptism that you believe Christ
[26:09] died for you amen
[26:11] and so and that you want to walk in
[26:14] newness of life with him
[26:16] and then further down he says but you
[26:18] say brother Bill did you ever baptize
[26:20] anybody over who'd been baptized when
[26:22] there was a little fellow and then be
[26:24] re-baptized and he says many times
[26:27] and then he's going to go into a
[26:29] scripture and he's going to correct a
[26:30] misunderstanding so I want you to catch
[26:32] this
[26:33] he said there's a scripture over in
[26:34] Revelations the second chapter speaking
[26:36] to the church said repent and do your
[26:38] first works over again
[26:40] and many of them interpret that
[26:41] scripture to say this that that means
[26:43] you'd have to go right back and do the
[26:46] same thing over well if you notice dear
[26:48] Christian friend now I'm not disagreeing
[26:51] with this now because we've got the
[26:52] Baptist refilled up we're ready to
[26:54] baptize anybody that wants to be
[26:55] baptized at any time but we're not
[26:57] disagreeing if you want to be baptized
[27:00] if that's something that stands in your
[27:01] way and you feel like you should be you
[27:04] go do it that's right you do it don't
[27:06] let nothing stand in your way you make
[27:08] yourself perfectly clear
[27:11] amen
[27:14] so then he goes down and he says if you
[27:16] want to be baptized again go ahead
[27:18] that's the thing to do I baptized many
[27:20] over but now to that scripture that you
[27:23] were referring to he's referring to
[27:25] Revelations the second chapter when when
[27:27] he says repent and do the first works
[27:28] again he's saying that the understanding
[27:31] is when you've Fallen away this is the
[27:33] understanding that we had in Pentecost
[27:35] when you've Fallen away then you've
[27:37] fallen out of Grace now you're a sinner
[27:39] again and you've got to go through the
[27:40] whole process over again of repentance
[27:42] and making your life right and all of
[27:44] that brother I'm saying that's not
[27:46] necessary that's not true he says now to
[27:49] that scripture that you're referring to
[27:50] that wasn't talking to an individual
[27:52] that was to the church
[27:53] see the church what they have done they
[27:55] had lost their first love the real cream
[27:58] that they had in the beginning and he
[28:00] said lest you repent and do the first
[28:01] works over again start right back and
[28:03] get the thing he's talking to the church
[28:05] unless you repent and go back again well
[28:07] then he was going to move the
[28:09] candlestick
[28:11] that you want but if you want to be
[28:13] baptized and if you was baptized when
[28:15] you was 13 or whatever age why you be
[28:17] baptized it's in your own way but now to
[28:20] say that scripturally I could say that
[28:22] you should be re-baptized again there's
[28:24] only one scriptural way that that I
[28:27] could advise that people was re-baptized
[28:30] there's only one scripture in the entire
[28:32] Bible that people was rebaptized and
[28:34] that was those who was baptized by John
[28:36] the Baptist before the Holy Ghost came
[28:38] Paul in Acts 19 5 told them that they
[28:40] had to be re-baptized again in the name
[28:43] of Jesus Christ in order to receive the
[28:45] Holy Ghost
[28:46] so then he goes down a little further he
[28:48] says now this is it
[28:50] it's but just say that you were baptized
[28:53] in Christian baptism at the age of 13
[28:54] and you've lived a Christian Life all
[28:57] the way along or if you've backslid a
[28:59] few times I don't know whether they got
[29:01] a backslide I wish somebody would go to
[29:04] ask me that he's doing questions and
[29:05] answers and he wished he had a question
[29:06] on backsliding
[29:08] he says I wish they'd asked me that but
[29:10] on backside remember you backslide every
[29:12] day
[29:13] there's no way at all for you to keep
[29:15] out of it all right but you backslide to
[29:17] the people in the church but not before
[29:19] God you backside on Christ but you don't
[29:20] own God because when you sin you're gone
[29:23] but you're constantly falling Paul had
[29:25] to die every day is that right he had to
[29:28] die every day repent every day and just
[29:30] constantly repenting all the time and if
[29:32] Paul had to do that then I'm going to
[29:34] have to do that aren't you that's right
[29:36] now if you've been if you've been
[29:38] redeemed and you feel that the blood of
[29:40] Jesus Christ cleansed you from sin and
[29:42] you've lived a Christian Life I wouldn't
[29:43] think it'd be necessary but if you want
[29:46] to all right it'll be fine we'd be glad
[29:48] to do it
[29:49] so I wanted to lay down that teaching
[29:51] because I don't want you know many of
[29:54] you were baptized as a child
[29:56] and some of you as young as seven or
[29:59] eight years old were baptized as a child
[30:01] and when you see somebody that wants to
[30:02] be re-baptized for conscience sake it
[30:05] may start a questioning in your heart
[30:06] but don't let it start a questioning in
[30:08] your heart because the baptism if you
[30:10] took scriptural baptism to baptism is
[30:12] good
[30:14] just because you failed God we've all
[30:16] failed God that doesn't mean you have to
[30:17] be re-baptized
[30:19] just because you vaccinated you failed
[30:21] and gone you've made mistakes that
[30:23] doesn't mean you've got to go back and
[30:24] redo the baptism the baptism was a good
[30:27] scriptural baptism
[30:29] and then there's also the idea that but
[30:31] I didn't understand correctly when I was
[30:34] six seven eight years old but I was 21
[30:37] years old when I got baptized and I
[30:39] didn't understand correctly
[30:41] I was honest to what I understood and
[30:43] what I saw I followed through with but I
[30:45] know a whole lot more now than I knew
[30:47] that day and if every time we understand
[30:49] baptism better we have to get
[30:51] re-baptized we might as well keep a line
[30:53] at the baptism every service
[30:55] right so I don't want anybody to be
[30:58] confused amen if you were baptized
[31:00] honestly with an honest heart at the
[31:02] place you were at at the time you were
[31:04] baptized and you were baptized according
[31:06] to the scripture your baptism is good
[31:09] so don't let the devil trouble your mind
[31:11] amen that the the case with our brother
[31:14] is he he knows that God's dealing with
[31:17] him and this is something he wants to do
[31:18] for himself for conscience sake to Sure
[31:21] up his foundation amen because he's
[31:23] questioning his motives at the time but
[31:25] not that he was baptized wrong or not
[31:27] because he did anything wrong
[31:30] are we squared away
[31:32] all right
[31:33] I don't want to have 10 baptisms the
[31:35] next Sunday
[31:37] because what will happen is if the devil
[31:39] starts to send you down that path he'll
[31:41] actually trouble your faith and actually
[31:43] move you off your foundation
[31:45] so there are times that it's appropriate
[31:47] and this is the case where it's
[31:48] appropriate there are times where it's
[31:50] appropriate it's a good thing and it'll
[31:52] be a blessing to somebody but there are
[31:54] times where if you keep questioning the
[31:56] foundation you're going to undermine
[31:57] your foundation and you'll constantly go
[31:59] from one question to the next question
[32:01] to the next question so I want everybody
[32:04] to be understood if you have any more
[32:06] questions on that you can come and ask
[32:07] me because I I want to have a good clear
[32:10] understanding so I hope we have a good
[32:12] clear understanding and now we can
[32:14] Rejoice for our brother
[32:16] because he's going to walk out of there
[32:17] knowing he's obeyed the Lord and
[32:19] everything is solid under his feet amen
[32:22] also for these three others will be
[32:24] baptized they'll walk out of there
[32:25] knowing they've kept the word of God
[32:27] they fully obeyed what God assured them
[32:29] to do if there's anybody else present
[32:32] who would like to be baptized today the
[32:33] baptism is open it's available we have
[32:36] clothes we have robes if you didn't
[32:37] bring clothes we have clothes for you
[32:39] and you're welcome to be baptized at the
[32:41] end of service I'll invite those who
[32:43] want to be baptized to go around back
[32:45] and if you're here and not been baptized
[32:47] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but
[32:49] would like to do so to fulfill the word
[32:51] to know your conscience is clear that
[32:53] you've done what the Bible says do this
[32:55] is a golden opportunity this morning
[32:58] that God has given you
[33:01] amen
[33:02] praise God I'm ready to preach let's
[33:04] stand
[33:06] let's stand and and respect to the word
[33:09] let's stand and read their scripture in
[33:10] in mark 16.
[33:29] Mark 16 and verse 12.
[33:33] this is after the resurrection of Jesus
[33:35] Christ
[33:38] it says
[33:40] Mark 16 verse 12 after that he appeared
[33:42] in another form unto two of them as they
[33:45] walked and went into the country
[33:48] may the Lord bless us as we look at his
[33:50] word you can be seated again
[33:53] I want to preach this morning on the
[33:54] appearing of the Lord
[33:56] and just want to look at that subject
[33:59] for a little bit this has actually
[34:00] become quite a huge subject for me as I
[34:02] look into it but I don't want to go into
[34:04] all of it there's only one aspect that I
[34:06] want to look into so when when we see
[34:09] this it says after that he appeared in
[34:11] another form unto two of them Jesus
[34:14] Christ had resurrected from the dead
[34:17] he had went to Calvary uh he he had went
[34:20] to Calvary and died he resurrected and
[34:23] now he was seen
[34:25] of Mary Magdalene and when when she saw
[34:27] him she didn't recognize him she thought
[34:29] he was the gardener
[34:30] and she had spent so much time with him
[34:32] she knew him she knew him intimately she
[34:34] knew him well these two that were on the
[34:36] road to Emmaus or the other two that he
[34:38] showed himself to he appeared in another
[34:39] form they were intimate with him they
[34:41] knew him they knew him well and though
[34:43] he walked with them for six hours and
[34:45] talked with them along the way they
[34:47] didn't know who it was
[34:49] Mary Magdalene who saw him after his
[34:52] resurrection amen she knew him so well
[34:54] loved him so dearly but she thought he
[34:57] was a gardener didn't realize that it
[34:59] was the Lord
[35:00] and we see that after the resurrection
[35:02] of Jesus Christ he can appear in another
[35:05] form
[35:07] and this word appear here is the word
[35:10] fanaru in the Greek then in listen when
[35:14] I say the words in Greek I'm doing the
[35:16] best I can please don't copy me you
[35:18] embarrass yourself if you try to sound
[35:20] intelligent to somebody else this is the
[35:22] best of my understanding the Greek word
[35:24] fanaroo and it's interpreted make
[35:26] manifest to appear to manifest to show
[35:29] but in the definition in the concordance
[35:32] it says to make manifest or visible are
[35:34] known what has been hidden or unknown to
[35:38] manifest whether by words or deeds or in
[35:40] any other way
[35:42] so here Jesus is being manifested
[35:45] are making visible after his
[35:48] resurrection himself but he's doing it
[35:49] in another form
[35:51] not they didn't see him as the same
[35:55] Jesus that they walked with in the same
[35:57] physical features they would have known
[35:59] him right off but here they walked six
[36:01] hours discussing with him things and
[36:03] they don't recognize him they invite him
[36:05] to dinner they don't recognize him they
[36:06] sit down they don't recognize him but at
[36:08] the table he does something just like he
[36:10] did it before and their eyes were open
[36:12] and they knew it was the Lord
[36:14] so the appearing of the Lord amen when
[36:17] we when we talk about the appearing of
[36:19] the lord we know that the Lord has
[36:20] appeared in our day is that right
[36:23] but but we're not looking for the nail
[36:25] scarred hands amen we're looking for the
[36:27] word made manifest
[36:29] looking for the Lord and so we'll get
[36:31] into that but but I wanted to lay this
[36:33] down as a foundation so that we
[36:35] understood amen there's so many times
[36:37] that that that terms mean something in
[36:40] our mind but we may have the wrong
[36:41] picture of what that term means amen so
[36:44] the appearing of the Lord doesn't mean
[36:46] that you'll when he appears that you'll
[36:48] always see him in the form he was
[36:49] crucified in
[36:51] but yet it's still him
[36:54] it's still him and he's still appearing
[36:57] or manifesting or revealing what was
[36:59] previously hidden
[37:01] but it may not be the same form
[37:05] let's turn to the book of Samuel
[37:07] first Samuel
[37:28] first Samuel chapter 3 verse 1.
[37:34] first Samuel chapter 3 verse 1.
[37:38] and the child Samuel ministered unto the
[37:40] Lord before Eli and the word of the Lord
[37:43] was precious in those days there was no
[37:45] open Vision this word precious can mean
[37:48] rare
[37:49] so the word of the Lord was very rare in
[37:52] those days because there was no open
[37:53] vision
[37:54] and and we know that Samuel was the
[37:57] daughter of Hannah Hannah had prayed for
[37:59] a child she was Barren and she prayed
[38:00] Eli prayed for her and she dedicated she
[38:03] promised the Lord he gave her a son she
[38:06] would dedicate to the Lord so she has
[38:07] Samuel and she takes Samuel back when
[38:09] he's weaned and dedicates him to the
[38:11] Lord and Samuel lives in the temple all
[38:13] of his life it would be the Tabernacle
[38:16] at this time and and now you know he
[38:20] he's growing up there but God's calling
[38:22] him calling him to be a prophet of the
[38:24] Lord and we sign the condition that
[38:26] we're in in this time you're in a time
[38:28] that the word of the Lord is rare
[38:29] because there's no open Vision it's been
[38:31] a long time since they've had a prophet
[38:35] just like the laodicean church AJ man
[38:37] the word of the Lord was precious in
[38:40] this day it was rare amen because the
[38:42] churches had by intellect taken the word
[38:45] and twisted it to their understanding
[38:46] and the true word of God had become rare
[38:49] has become manipulated it's become
[38:52] tainted it's become I mean people were
[38:54] doing the best that they knew how amen
[38:56] were not criticizing them but in the
[38:57] best that they knew how was false fell
[39:00] far short of the true interpretation of
[39:02] the word
[39:04] so so we were in a time in this age that
[39:09] the word of the Lord was rare and there
[39:11] was no open Vision there had been no
[39:13] Prophet since the Apostle Paul
[39:16] and so when we look at first Samuel 3
[39:19] let's go down to verse 19.
[39:22] it says and Samuel grew and the Lord was
[39:25] with him and did let none of his words
[39:27] fall to the ground
[39:29] and all Israel from Dan even to
[39:31] Beersheba knew that Samuel was
[39:33] established to be a prophet of the Lord
[39:36] and the Lord appeared again in Shiloh
[39:40] for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel
[39:42] and Shiloh by the word of the Lord
[39:46] here the Lord appeared
[39:48] what did he look like
[39:51] what form when we see this is an
[39:54] appearing of the Lord in the Bible the
[39:56] Lord appeared again in Shiloh so he
[39:59] hadn't been appearing in Shiloh why
[40:01] wasn't he appearing in Shiloh because
[40:02] the word of the Lord had become rare
[40:04] there was no open Vision amen Shiloh was
[40:06] the temple it was where they had the uh
[40:09] the priests were operating and all of
[40:10] that but now it says the Lord appeared
[40:14] again in Shiloh amen wow did he appear
[40:17] he appeared through a prophetic message
[40:20] because the word came back to Shiloh
[40:22] and when the word came back to Shiloh
[40:25] through a prophetic gift the Lord
[40:26] appeared once again in Shiloh
[40:30] man oh praise God can we say Amen the
[40:33] Lord appeared once again in our day
[40:38] the Lord appeared once again amen where
[40:41] he was before he appeared once again
[40:43] amen he was in the church but the church
[40:45] bound him by rivers of denomination and
[40:47] Creeds amen limiting the Holy Ghost
[40:49] limiting the word amen but he comes
[40:52] Unbound at the end of the ages by a
[40:54] prophetic Ministry and a message that is
[40:56] Unbound now the Holy Ghost back in the
[40:59] church again and now he's showing it
[41:01] through a sign through a prophetic gift
[41:03] and and the and the the Lord appeared in
[41:06] our day once again
[41:09] the same way he appeared in that day
[41:16] chapter 4 verse 1.
[41:19] in the word of Samuel came to all Israel
[41:25] so we think the Lord appeared again
[41:28] in Shiloh for because the Lord revealed
[41:32] himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word
[41:36] of the Lord
[41:37] when the word of the Lord came
[41:39] Samuel the Lord appeared again in Shiloh
[41:43] but then the next line the word of
[41:46] Samuel went out to Israel
[41:48] the question is was it the word of
[41:50] Samuel was it the word of the Lord
[41:55] praise God
[41:57] I love the way the Bible's written
[41:59] friends
[42:00] it's so beautiful was it the word of
[42:02] Samuel or was it the word of the Lord
[42:05] amen that's why on our day you people
[42:07] ask you know why is it you quote a
[42:09] prophet why do you read his books amen
[42:11] because the Lord appeared again in our
[42:13] day
[42:14] the Lord appeared again in the church
[42:16] again he's come back to the church he's
[42:18] come back to the Gentiles the Lord
[42:20] appeared again in our day in the church
[42:23] amen because he gave the word of the
[42:26] Lord to the prophet William Branham amen
[42:28] and now the word of William Branham went
[42:31] out to Israel but I can look beyond that
[42:33] and I can see this is the appearing of
[42:35] the Lord this is the word of the Lord
[42:38] this is why we read message books this
[42:40] is why we listen to tapes this is why
[42:43] we quote the prophet
[42:45] the same reason why they listened to
[42:47] Samuel
[42:51] is the Lord appeared again
[42:52] when he brought his word
[42:55] this word appeared in this scripture
[42:59] it's translated to see look at inspect
[43:02] perceive consider it means to appear or
[43:05] to present oneself
[43:08] to cause to see or to show
[43:12] the Lord when he brought the word back
[43:14] through a prophet he unveiled himself
[43:17] he showed who he was he showed himself
[43:20] amen he declared through his word
[43:22] because God is the word
[43:25] amen that's John 1 1 in the beginning
[43:27] was the word and the Word was with God
[43:28] and the Word was God and God is the word
[43:30] and when God brought the word back to a
[43:33] prophet God made himself appear again by
[43:36] bringing that word
[43:39] he he presented himself
[43:44] he appeared
[43:46] praise God
[43:47] sometimes appearing is not always
[43:50] what we think
[43:53] I say
[43:55] when you say he appeared in Shiloh run
[43:58] to Shiloh
[44:00] and find him
[44:02] run to Shiloh and describe what he looks
[44:05] like run to Shiloh and tell me what his
[44:07] voice sounds like run to Shiloh amen
[44:09] because What You Won't See Is him what
[44:12] you will see is a prophet who's bringing
[44:13] his word and that word is him
[44:18] the prophet's not him but the prophet
[44:20] standing there is a representation of
[44:21] him because he's bringing the word of
[44:23] God and God is the word and God's
[44:25] presenting himself in Shiloh again
[44:28] praise be to God
[44:30] so what does he look like what does his
[44:32] voice sound like how tall is he he
[44:34] appeared he appeared did you say he
[44:36] appeared he appeared I should be able to
[44:37] tell you how tall he is what is no it's
[44:39] not that kind of appearing
[44:42] and he appeared in our day
[44:45] let's go to Genesis 18.
[44:50] this one we know very very well
[44:55] but we have to look at it right now
[44:58] or at least I do
[45:01] Hebrews 18 or sorry Genesis 18 sorry
[45:04] Genesis 18 verse 1.
[45:08] Genesis 18 verse 1.
[45:14] he says and the Lord appeared unto him
[45:17] in the plains of memory and he sat in
[45:20] the Tipton Door In the Heat of the day
[45:22] so this is the Lord this this word Lord
[45:25] is Jehovah amen the self-existent one
[45:28] who reveals himself almighty God Elohim
[45:30] this is who this is and the Lord
[45:32] appeared unto him who's him it's Abraham
[45:35] the Lord appeared unto Abraham and the
[45:37] plains of mammary and he sat in the tent
[45:39] during the heat of the day and he lifted
[45:41] up his eyes and looked and loathed three
[45:43] men stood by him and when he saw them he
[45:46] ran to meet them from the tent door and
[45:48] bowed himself toward the ground and he
[45:50] said my Lord if now I have found favor
[45:52] in thy sight pass not away I pray thee
[45:55] from my servant let a little water I
[45:57] pray they be fetched and wash your feet
[45:59] and rest yourselves under the tree and I
[46:01] will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort
[46:03] your hearts after that you shall pass on
[46:06] for therefore are you come to your
[46:08] servant and they said so do as thou has
[46:11] said and Abraham hastened into the tent
[46:14] into Sarah and said make ready quickly
[46:16] three measures of fine meal need it make
[46:19] cakes upon the Hearth and Abraham ran
[46:21] into the herd and fetched a calf tender
[46:24] and good and gave it unto the young men
[46:25] and he hasted to dress it and he took
[46:28] butter and milk and a calf which he
[46:30] addressed and said it before them and he
[46:33] stood by them under the tree and they
[46:35] did eat
[46:36] here the Lord appeared and he's eating
[46:41] in Shiloh he appeared
[46:44] but what form was it here he appeared in
[46:47] another form
[46:50] and he appeared in a form of Flesh as a
[46:53] man
[46:55] and we know the prophet tells us amen
[46:57] that this was a temporary dwelling place
[46:58] for God not a permanent God's permanent
[47:01] body of flesh is Jesus Christ
[47:03] and that would be birth through the womb
[47:05] of a virgin amen this was a temporary
[47:07] place that he took the elements of the
[47:10] ground created a body stepped into it
[47:12] and in this appearing he took on a form
[47:14] of Flesh where he could drink milk eat
[47:16] butter eat the Flesh of a calf
[47:19] and talk to Abraham
[47:23] verse 9 and they said unto him
[47:25] where is Sarah thy wife and he said
[47:27] behold in the tenth and he said I will
[47:29] certainly return unto thee according to
[47:31] the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife
[47:34] shall have a son
[47:35] and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[47:37] which was behind them now Abraham and
[47:39] Sarah were old and well-stricken in age
[47:41] and it ceased to be with Sarah after the
[47:42] manner of women therefore Sarah laughed
[47:45] within herself saying after I am waxed
[47:48] old shall I have pleasure my Lord being
[47:50] old also and the Lord said unto Abraham
[47:53] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[47:55] of Surety bear a child which I'm old is
[47:58] anything too hard for the Lord at the
[48:01] time appointed I will return unto thee
[48:03] according to the time of life and Sarah
[48:05] shall have a son
[48:06] see the Lord is Discerning the thought
[48:09] of Sarah not the words of Sarah she
[48:10] didn't speak this she thought this in
[48:12] the tent
[48:14] and he sitting with his back to the tent
[48:17] she's in the tent behind him amen he's
[48:20] Discerning her thoughts so here and
[48:22] disappearing he's in a body of Flesh
[48:25] amen and he's eating and drinking and
[48:28] visiting and brother remember says he
[48:30] has dust on his clothes and he that he
[48:32] had to have his feet washed he had dust
[48:34] on his feet
[48:35] he come in flesh and he could discern
[48:38] the thoughts of Sarah behind him
[48:41] he also could tell them the correct
[48:43] names because just before this they were
[48:45] Abram and Sarai and now God had changed
[48:47] their name supernaturally visited them
[48:49] and changed it to Abraham and Sarah and
[48:51] hear this man that shows up on the scene
[48:53] he knows their correct name
[48:55] he can say your name is Abraham your
[48:58] name is Sarah
[49:02] and he can discern the thoughts behind
[49:05] him
[49:07] so
[49:08] I want to continue reading
[49:11] and so
[49:13] he asked why did Sarah laugh is anything
[49:16] too hard for the Lord at the appointed
[49:18] time I will return unto thee according
[49:19] to the time of life and Sheriff shall
[49:21] have a son verse 15 then Sarah denied
[49:24] saying I laugh not for she was afraid
[49:26] and he said nay but thou dids laugh
[49:30] and the men rose up from thence and
[49:32] looked towards Sodom and Abram Abraham
[49:34] went with them to bring them on the way
[49:36] and the Lord said shall I hide from
[49:38] Abraham that thing which I do seeing
[49:41] that Abraham shall surely become a great
[49:43] and mighty nation in all the nations of
[49:45] the Earth shall be blessed in him for I
[49:47] know him that he will command his
[49:48] children after him
[49:50] I'm not going to read any further but he
[49:52] goes on to tell him that destruction
[49:54] time has come
[49:56] that judgment is coming upon Sodom and
[49:58] Gomorrah for their sins have reached
[50:00] into heaven so this this appearing of
[50:03] the Lord he appears in a body of Flesh
[50:05] that's not his permanent flesh that's
[50:08] going to be Jesus Christ
[50:09] his only begotten son but he's in a body
[50:12] of flesh eating drinking dust on his
[50:14] feet amen he knows their name amen he
[50:17] knows where to find them he can discern
[50:19] the thoughts behind them and he's going
[50:21] to tell him the pending judgment and
[50:24] what's about to happen
[50:26] this scene has repeated in our day
[50:29] the same scene has been laid out for us
[50:32] and repeated again in our day
[50:36] the prophet of God says in the message
[50:37] the identified Christ of all ages he
[50:39] says and what that man that man in that
[50:42] human flesh what did why did Sarah laugh
[50:45] what happened Abraham called that man
[50:47] Elohim almighty God represented in human
[50:50] being Jesus our lord says as it was in
[50:53] the days of La so shall it be at the
[50:55] coming and watch when the son of man is
[50:57] being manifested made known Luke 17 when
[51:00] the son of man in the last day is being
[51:02] revealed the son of man being revealed
[51:04] his gospel is identifying him as it was
[51:07] in the days of lot
[51:09] look how they're doing now perverting
[51:12] Nations
[51:13] oh my look at the homosexuals and look
[51:16] at what we got now the church is a mess
[51:18] the nation is a mess and the whole thing
[51:20] God is belching it up from the top
[51:22] bottom of the Earth the whole thing is a
[51:24] mess graphically and also in the
[51:27] material the scene is said isn't it time
[51:29] for God to come back in human flesh
[51:32] the word that's sharper than a two-edged
[51:35] sword and discerner the thoughts and
[51:36] intents of the harm to appear on the
[51:39] scene to make Jesus Christ the same
[51:40] yesterday today and forever it's a
[51:43] promised word that's been lauded for
[51:44] this day we are living in this day and
[51:47] God is here with us to manifest that and
[51:49] make it true
[51:53] he says in God's provide a place of
[51:55] worship but we promise just before the
[51:57] coming of the end time the world would
[51:59] get like it was in Sodom when a man came
[52:01] down in human form
[52:03] three of them two angels and God himself
[52:05] that was God
[52:07] the Bible said it was
[52:09] now he come down and he manifested
[52:11] himself here there by turning his back
[52:14] to the tent where Sarah was and told
[52:16] Abraham what Sarah was thinking in the
[52:18] tent that's right now Jesus himself said
[52:21] at the day when the son of man is being
[52:23] revealed in other words the son of man
[52:25] the ministry of Jesus Christ himself
[52:28] when Jesus Christ was on Earth he called
[52:31] himself the son of man the son of man
[52:33] all through the gospels he calls himself
[52:35] the son of man amen but he lays down a
[52:38] prophecy in the Bible and we want to
[52:40] turn there to the Book of Matthew let's
[52:41] turn together to Matthew
[52:46] Matthew 24.
[53:00] Matthew 24 and verse 36.
[53:06] he says but of that day and hour
[53:10] knoweth no man no not the angels of
[53:12] heaven but my father only
[53:15] I love I you know I say this all the
[53:18] time but I love the Bible
[53:20] and I love this message because they
[53:22] dovetail together
[53:24] the the message illuminates the
[53:26] scriptures
[53:28] and and Reveals All The Hidden Truths
[53:31] he says but of that day an hour north no
[53:33] man no not the angels of heaven but my
[53:35] father only so Jesus is saying of that
[53:38] day and hour nobody knows not even the
[53:41] angels of heaven but only my father but
[53:43] he doesn't leave it there
[53:45] he says but as the days of Noah were now
[53:49] all of a sudden he's saying I can't tell
[53:51] you the day or hour but I can give you a
[53:53] clue
[53:54] I can give you a clue so that you will
[53:57] that you'll have something to look for
[53:58] amen so that you have something to
[54:00] discern amensely or something to look to
[54:02] in my word so you can say this is that
[54:06] but as the days of nowhere so shall also
[54:08] the coming of the son of man be for as
[54:10] in the days that were before the flood
[54:12] they were eating and drinking marrying
[54:13] and giving and marriage until the day
[54:15] that Noah entered the Ark and knew not
[54:18] until the flood came and took them all
[54:19] away so shall also the coming of the son
[54:23] of man be so in the coming of the son of
[54:25] man it'll be as it was in the days of
[54:26] Noah what was it like in the days of
[54:28] Noah in the days of Noah a man's heart
[54:31] was evil continually
[54:34] there was men taking women to be wives
[54:36] amen marriage and divorce and remarriage
[54:39] was on the Rampage violence filled the
[54:41] Earth every desire of a man's heart was
[54:43] only evil continually amen I say we've
[54:46] come back to the days of Noah
[54:48] and in the days of Noah God sent a
[54:51] prophet to prepare a way of Escape amen
[54:53] God sent a prophet with a message and
[54:55] that message was salvation to that
[54:57] generation if they would only believe
[54:59] him and get in the ark
[55:01] amen and he says as it was in the days
[55:03] of Noah if you say as it was in the days
[55:05] of Noah then there must be a repeat amen
[55:07] somebody's got to be building a giant
[55:09] boat no he's showing you in symbol form
[55:12] in a foreshadow what's coming amen but
[55:14] the foreshadow is not going to be a
[55:16] repeat of somebody building an ark the
[55:18] ark that's built now is Christ the word
[55:20] amen if you come into Christ the word
[55:22] you'll be saved
[55:27] praise God
[55:28] so in the day all this evil and all this
[55:32] wicked we've returned to that time
[55:37] and in that time God sent a prophet with
[55:40] a message
[55:41] and gave a way of escape to the pending
[55:44] judgment
[55:46] that's repeated
[55:47] in our day
[55:49] let's look at Luke together
[55:52] Luke 17.
[55:56] this is the other scripture that the
[55:58] prophet of God references over and over
[56:00] again
[56:02] Luke 17.
[56:08] in verse 26.
[56:12] Luke 17 26 men's Hearts failing them for
[56:15] fear
[56:17] I'm sorry
[56:18] I'm in the wrong one Luke 17 sorry I'm
[56:20] in the wrong chapter Luke 17 26 and as
[56:23] it was in the days of Noah so shall it
[56:25] be also in the days of the son of man so
[56:28] we see Jesus is speaking in the same
[56:30] passage and a different and this is Luke
[56:32] but he's speaking the same thing as it
[56:34] was in the days of no so shall it be
[56:36] also in the days of the son of man they
[56:38] did eat they drank they married wives
[56:40] they were given and married until the
[56:42] day that Noah entered the Ark and the
[56:44] flood came and destroyed them all
[56:45] likewise also as it was in the days of
[56:48] lot they did eat they drank they bought
[56:50] they sold they planted they build it but
[56:52] the same day that lot went out of Sodom
[56:54] it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[56:56] and destroyed them all even thus shall
[56:59] it be in the day when the son of man is
[57:02] revealed
[57:03] prophet of God would go to the scripture
[57:05] over and over and over in his ministry
[57:07] showing that there's coming a day that
[57:09] the son of man will be revealed and
[57:10] it'll be when the world is in a
[57:12] condition like it was in the days of
[57:13] life and where was lot lot was in Sodom
[57:16] what was in Sodom sexual perversion
[57:18] homosexuality violence and all kinds of
[57:21] manner of corruption and sin was there a
[57:24] have we if we come to that place again
[57:29] I mean it wasn't just homosexuality in
[57:31] Sodom it was aggressive homosexuality
[57:34] and we have come back to that time
[57:37] but praise God in that time the Lord
[57:40] appeared
[57:42] that scene the Lord appeared and he made
[57:44] a way of Escape amen but oh praise be to
[57:47] God that he came to his elect who was
[57:50] trying to live a separated life from the
[57:52] world and he came to his elect and he
[57:54] revealed himself in flesh with
[57:56] discernment amen and he showed him the
[57:58] sign of the Messiah before the Messiah
[58:01] even came
[58:04] and so in the days of lot
[58:07] we see we've returned to the days of lot
[58:10] Sodom and Gomorrah is all around us but
[58:13] all in the days of lot there was an
[58:15] appearing of the Lord
[58:17] in flesh
[58:20] praise God
[58:22] I want to
[58:24] jump over here and read something the
[58:26] message perseverance says Jesus said as
[58:28] it was in the days of Sodom so shall it
[58:30] be at the returning of the son of man
[58:33] it'll be the same thing in the days that
[58:35] you notice in Sodom there it said in
[58:37] Luke 17 15 it said when the days of
[58:39] Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[58:41] the son of man when the son of man is
[58:43] being revealed
[58:45] in the days that the son of man is
[58:47] revealed like he was at Sodom the same
[58:49] thing will be taking place
[58:51] so he ties it right back to these two
[58:54] scripture passages and ties it right
[58:56] back to Genesis 18 and says in the day
[58:59] that the son of man is revealed it'll be
[59:00] like it was there and that's exactly
[59:03] what happened in our day that God came
[59:05] down in human flesh the Flesh of that
[59:07] prophet and he began to operate through
[59:10] that flesh body and declare that I am
[59:12] here and he brought the word back and
[59:14] the Lord appeared
[59:16] in our day
[59:19] the Lord appeared in our day
[59:24] he says in who is this Melchizedek and
[59:26] being that I've told you all these
[59:28] nights tonight that he is not dead he is
[59:30] here and promised to do the same thing
[59:33] and promise that there would come a time
[59:34] in the last days according to Malachi 4
[59:36] and according to Saint Luke that he
[59:38] would appear again in human form among
[59:41] his people
[59:42] and do the same things and reveal the
[59:44] same things the same Messianic sign
[59:48] when God appeared to Abraham he could
[59:50] discern the thoughts of Sarah behind him
[59:52] when Jesus stood on this Earth he could
[59:54] discern the thoughts of the Pharisees
[59:56] and to serve the thoughts of those
[59:57] around him
[59:58] amen but when God appeared in this day
[1:00:01] amen through a prophet messenger and
[1:00:03] through that prophet he could discern
[1:00:04] the thoughts of the people
[1:00:06] and so we wouldn't miss what he was
[1:00:08] doing he would turn around at the end of
[1:00:10] the service and turn his back to the so
[1:00:12] he wasn't looking at anyone amen and he
[1:00:14] would begin to call people out in the
[1:00:16] balcony and over in the back and over on
[1:00:18] this side amen with his back turned to
[1:00:19] them why was he turning their back some
[1:00:21] of them are so far away there's no way
[1:00:23] you could recognize him anyways he
[1:00:25] wasn't turning the back to make it
[1:00:26] harder he was turning his back so you
[1:00:28] would see we've come right back to the
[1:00:30] days of lot
[1:00:32] we have returned to the days of Sodom
[1:00:34] and Gomorrah we've returned this
[1:00:36] prophecy is now being fulfilled in our
[1:00:39] eyes
[1:00:43] amen why so we could recognize the
[1:00:46] appearing of the Lord
[1:00:49] that he's here
[1:00:52] he came as the son of man and the coming
[1:00:56] of the son of man he come to reveal
[1:00:58] himself
[1:01:01] praise be to God
[1:01:06] in the Feast of Trumps he said how will
[1:01:08] the Messiah how will the people that's
[1:01:09] believing him know it unless they're
[1:01:11] constantly in the word to know what he
[1:01:12] is
[1:01:13] then he said the wife shall know but the
[1:01:15] foolish the unwise would not they shall
[1:01:17] know their God but now how he shall
[1:01:20] appear in the last days is to bring the
[1:01:23] people back to the word
[1:01:25] so that the bride will know her husband
[1:01:27] know her mate the revealed word that's
[1:01:30] why this has to happen
[1:01:32] we know when we read the New Testament
[1:01:34] when we get to the Book of Revelation
[1:01:36] all of a sudden in the Book of
[1:01:37] Revelation I mean we start to see this
[1:01:39] term come up we start to see this term
[1:01:41] of Bride and Lamb's wife Amen in the
[1:01:44] marriage of the lamb and all of a sudden
[1:01:46] we can see at the end of the New
[1:01:47] Testament they're supposed to be a
[1:01:49] marriage they're supposed to be a wife
[1:01:50] they're supposed to be a bride and whose
[1:01:52] bride is it it's the Lamb's bride
[1:01:55] it's the Lamb's wife amen and so we we
[1:01:58] recognize amen that that this church
[1:02:01] this New Testament Church has to come to
[1:02:03] be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:02:07] so this bride amen she was stuck in all
[1:02:13] kinds of church traditions and all kinds
[1:02:15] of misunderstandings amen but we know
[1:02:17] Christ is the word amen if you'll turn
[1:02:19] with me to John John chapter 1 and we'll
[1:02:22] read this very familiar passage of
[1:02:24] scripture but we want to look at it
[1:02:25] again
[1:02:29] John chapter 1 verse 1.
[1:02:33] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:02:35] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:02:38] so then we jump to verse 14 and the Word
[1:02:40] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[1:02:43] behold his glory the glory of the only
[1:02:44] begotten of the father full of grace and
[1:02:46] truth
[1:02:47] so in the beginning was the word and the
[1:02:49] word is with God and the Word was God
[1:02:51] but then that word that is God was made
[1:02:54] flesh and dwelt Among Us in the flesh of
[1:02:56] Jesus Christ
[1:02:58] in that Jesus Christ is the Lamb that
[1:03:02] will have a wife
[1:03:05] he is the word made flesh he is the word
[1:03:08] in full measure he became the Flesh of
[1:03:11] the word the full declaration and one
[1:03:14] human being of all that God was was
[1:03:17] manifest in Jesus Christ
[1:03:19] he was the expressed image or the exact
[1:03:22] image or the full image in flesh of God
[1:03:27] and he was the word made flesh
[1:03:31] and so now this lamb this Christ he's
[1:03:35] got to have a bride and that bride will
[1:03:37] be a gentile bride amen made out of the
[1:03:40] Gentile church and that bride is coming
[1:03:42] at the end in the Book of Revelation and
[1:03:44] she's coming into manifestation amen but
[1:03:47] that bride has got to know who her
[1:03:49] husband is but she's confused about her
[1:03:51] mate she's confused about her husband
[1:03:53] because of all the church traditions and
[1:03:55] all the doctrines and all the
[1:03:57] denominations and all that's happened
[1:03:58] for the previous 2000 years so God in
[1:04:01] his goodness he's going to come and
[1:04:03] appear at the end time amen how is he
[1:04:06] going to appear through a body of Flesh
[1:04:08] and he's going to show the sign of
[1:04:10] discernment amen he's going to be in the
[1:04:12] form of a man but he's going to show the
[1:04:14] sign that this is more than a man
[1:04:16] that's why the prophet would say I can't
[1:04:18] do that you didn't touch me who did you
[1:04:20] touch you touched the priest the hymn of
[1:04:22] the high priest I can do nothing for you
[1:04:24] I'm just a man and when he would discern
[1:04:26] he said now you know that's not me a man
[1:04:28] can't know that that has to be him
[1:04:31] so that we would see the appearing of
[1:04:33] the Lord but how did he appear in the
[1:04:35] appearing he brought his word
[1:04:38] why did he appear this is what he says
[1:04:41] he shall appear in the last days is to
[1:04:43] bring the people back to the word he
[1:04:45] appeared so he can introduce himself to
[1:04:48] his bride so that she can actually know
[1:04:51] who her mate is who the bridegroom
[1:04:53] really is
[1:04:56] so that she'll stop marrying churches
[1:05:00] she'll stop pledging herself in churches
[1:05:03] and giving herself to churches and
[1:05:05] doctors and dogmas so that she'll stop
[1:05:07] doing that but she'll bring amen so that
[1:05:09] she will bring herself she'll recognize
[1:05:12] her mate and lay herself down at his
[1:05:14] feet in him only
[1:05:19] he appeared in this day
[1:05:23] that's how he appeared
[1:05:25] is to bring
[1:05:27] the people back to the word
[1:05:30] when
[1:05:32] when God
[1:05:34] presented himself to Abraham in the
[1:05:37] plains of memory
[1:05:38] he did so for a purpose
[1:05:42] when he appeared
[1:05:43] he appeared for a purpose
[1:05:46] because there was a prophecy that needed
[1:05:48] to be fulfilled there was a promise that
[1:05:51] he had made and that promise was that
[1:05:54] Abraham shall have a promised son an
[1:05:56] heir and that will be Isaac and and it
[1:05:59] had been 25 years since the promise was
[1:06:01] given but yet no Isaac amen and in that
[1:06:04] time so many things had happened and and
[1:06:06] so many miscalculations and missteps and
[1:06:09] and and all of these things but in that
[1:06:12] time the prophecy was still true
[1:06:16] and it had gone so long and now Abraham
[1:06:19] and Sarah are getting older and older
[1:06:21] and older until I cease to be with them
[1:06:24] after the manner of a married couple and
[1:06:26] and now he was as good as dead and she
[1:06:29] was dried up
[1:06:33] but he was going to come on the scene to
[1:06:35] fulfill the prophecy
[1:06:37] he wasn't just making an appearance to
[1:06:39] make an appearance he was making an
[1:06:40] appearance to accomplish something
[1:06:44] he was coming on the scene to accomplish
[1:06:47] something
[1:06:48] because
[1:06:50] you know everything has its appointed
[1:06:53] time and it's a point of season
[1:06:55] and God came and tells Abraham who's the
[1:06:58] father of the faith amen Abraham
[1:07:00] believed God and it was imputed in him
[1:07:01] for righteousness so Abraham comes and
[1:07:04] he believes the promise and he receives
[1:07:06] the message for his day that he's going
[1:07:08] to receive a promised son that he is the
[1:07:10] going to inherit this land and God's
[1:07:13] called him into a life of Separation to
[1:07:15] come into the land and God's going to
[1:07:16] give it to him and to his children and
[1:07:18] that he's going to have an heir that's
[1:07:20] all the word for his day
[1:07:23] and he continually separates and moves
[1:07:26] more into this vision and more into this
[1:07:28] Vision over time
[1:07:30] he gets more aligned with the prophecy
[1:07:32] as time goes on
[1:07:34] but then you know Sarah is also there
[1:07:37] and she knows the prophecy and she knows
[1:07:40] the promise to Abraham and she knows
[1:07:41] that Abraham will have a son and and
[1:07:43] although they were young and they lived
[1:07:46] together as young man and woman from the
[1:07:48] time they were young they together could
[1:07:50] never produce a child
[1:07:53] it could never produce a child
[1:07:56] but Abraham could produce a child
[1:07:59] because when Sarah said the Lord has
[1:08:01] withheld me from bearing take my
[1:08:04] handmade he took Hagar and he produced a
[1:08:06] child so Abraham could produce a child
[1:08:08] hey but Sarah didn't believe she could
[1:08:10] produce a child
[1:08:13] she said the Lord has withhelding me she
[1:08:15] didn't believe she could produce the
[1:08:16] child amen and so they're moving all
[1:08:19] along and they have all of these things
[1:08:20] and I would say the biggest problem with
[1:08:23] Sarah is Sarah didn't recognize she was
[1:08:26] an integral part of the promise
[1:08:29] she didn't recognize herself in the
[1:08:31] prophecy
[1:08:33] amen she it's not that Sarah disbelieved
[1:08:37] the word because she believed whatever
[1:08:39] Abraham told her I'm sure she believed
[1:08:41] that God spoke to Abraham and Abraham
[1:08:43] would have a son that's why she's saying
[1:08:45] take Hagar maybe this is the way to
[1:08:47] fulfill the word it's not because she
[1:08:48] doesn't believe it she doesn't believe
[1:08:50] she can do it
[1:08:53] she's not doubting the promise she's
[1:08:56] doubting her part in the promise
[1:09:01] so God has got to come on the scene
[1:09:06] when we realize when God comes on the
[1:09:08] scene God is not necessarily dealing
[1:09:11] with Abraham he's already met Abraham
[1:09:13] multiple times
[1:09:14] he's met Abraham and met Abraham and met
[1:09:16] Abraham and met Abraham but this time
[1:09:19] when he comes to meet Abraham he's
[1:09:20] dealing with Sarah
[1:09:23] amen
[1:09:24] now he comes and he and he's and now
[1:09:27] Sarah has this doubt she has this
[1:09:30] unbelief that's holding her down amen
[1:09:33] and now he begins to show the sign of
[1:09:35] discernment and now it's not just out
[1:09:37] there over here but now it's for her
[1:09:40] now he says why did Sarah laugh in the
[1:09:43] tent and then she denied it and he says
[1:09:45] but you did and the whole thing's
[1:09:46] exposed and and now he says I will visit
[1:09:49] you according Amen to the time of life
[1:09:52] and you shall and Sarah shall conceive
[1:09:54] you shall have a son all of these things
[1:09:56] are part of the promise
[1:09:58] and what God does is he comes back on
[1:10:01] the scene in his appearing and he says
[1:10:04] listen you're missing a part of this
[1:10:06] you're part of the promise
[1:10:10] and he's coming amen so that Sarah now
[1:10:13] knows you're part of the promise
[1:10:16] amen because there's a church amen and
[1:10:18] the church has believed in Jesus Christ
[1:10:20] and believe he's the son of God and
[1:10:22] believed in the Holy Ghost and believed
[1:10:24] that Paul was an apostle and believe
[1:10:25] that the Bible is Right amen but where
[1:10:28] is her doubt where's her
[1:10:29] misunderstanding she's not catching that
[1:10:31] she's the mystery part
[1:10:34] Sarah wasn't catching that she was the
[1:10:36] mystery of the prophecy the mystery the
[1:10:39] hidden part because Abraham could
[1:10:41] produce the son Abraham could have
[1:10:42] haggar Abraham could have had otherwise
[1:10:44] Abraham could have sons but that's not
[1:10:47] the prophecy the prophecy is he will
[1:10:49] have an heir amen and that air has to
[1:10:52] come from his wife because his wife is
[1:10:54] part of him Amen in order for it to come
[1:10:57] from him it's got to come from both
[1:10:59] parts of him
[1:11:02] Abraham
[1:11:04] and his wife
[1:11:06] so now in this appearing
[1:11:09] he's showing himself in his power
[1:11:13] to her
[1:11:18] praise God
[1:11:20] for what reason because it's time to
[1:11:23] fulfill the promise
[1:11:25] because it's the season to fulfill This
[1:11:27] Promise in order to fulfill This Promise
[1:11:30] Sarah has to believe
[1:11:34] in order to fill the fulfill his promise
[1:11:36] Sarah has to believe
[1:11:40] amen if you'll turn with me to Genesis
[1:11:43] 21
[1:11:46] well let's go to Genesis 18. let's go
[1:11:48] back to Genesis 18.
[1:12:00] Genesis 18 and 13.
[1:12:04] and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore
[1:12:07] did Sarah laugh saying shall I have
[1:12:09] surely bear a child which IM old is
[1:12:11] anything too hard for the Lord at the
[1:12:14] time appointed I will return unto thee
[1:12:15] according to the time of life and Sarah
[1:12:17] shall have a son
[1:12:23] then Sarah denied
[1:12:25] that means Sarah heard all of this
[1:12:30] before God is dealing with Abraham with
[1:12:32] Abraham with Abraham but now he's coming
[1:12:34] to deal with Sarah
[1:12:36] and make and he told Abraham Sarah shall
[1:12:40] have a child but this time she heard it
[1:12:42] herself
[1:12:45] after he showed the sign and the
[1:12:48] discernment
[1:12:49] and now he says Sarah shall have a son
[1:12:53] and so let's go over to
[1:12:55] Genesis 21 he said I will return unto
[1:12:57] you according to the time of life
[1:13:01] and we come to chapter 21 Genesis
[1:13:04] chapter 21 it says in the Lord visited
[1:13:08] Sarah as he had said and the Lord did
[1:13:11] unto Sarah as he had spoken for Sarah
[1:13:14] conceived and bear Abraham a son in his
[1:13:16] old age at the set time of which God had
[1:13:19] spoken to him
[1:13:22] what was the mystery part of this
[1:13:24] prophecy the woman
[1:13:27] it was Sarah
[1:13:28] there's been a mystery part amen through
[1:13:31] the New Testament and that mystery part
[1:13:33] is the bride
[1:13:35] my God although the prophecies were
[1:13:37] there although Paul spoke of it although
[1:13:39] he laid it out amen there had to be an
[1:13:42] appearing in the end time amen where God
[1:13:44] would show that I'm here God would show
[1:13:47] himself like he did on the plains of
[1:13:49] mamrid God would fulfill the prophecy
[1:13:51] that Jesus laid down in the coming of
[1:13:53] the son of man in the revealing of the
[1:13:55] son of man he would come back as the son
[1:13:57] of man through a prophetic office and he
[1:13:59] would show the sign of discernment and
[1:14:01] he would confirm the promise Amen to the
[1:14:04] bride to the church you're the one
[1:14:06] you're going to bear this son you're
[1:14:08] going to display the life of Jesus
[1:14:10] Christ
[1:14:11] it's you
[1:14:13] and then the next visitation from the
[1:14:16] Lord is a private visitation to Sarah
[1:14:19] he comes to her and he confirms the
[1:14:22] promise in her now let's go to Hebrews I
[1:14:25] know we've been through these scriptures
[1:14:26] before but let's go to Hebrews 11.
[1:14:29] verse 11.
[1:14:37] Hebrews 11 11.
[1:14:45] in Hebrews 11 11 says through faith also
[1:14:49] Sarah herself received strength to
[1:14:52] conceive seed it was delivered of a
[1:14:55] child when she was past age because she
[1:14:58] judged him faithful who had promised
[1:15:02] you know Sarah was struggling all along
[1:15:05] and misunderstanding
[1:15:08] but when God came on the planes of
[1:15:11] memory he began to deal with her
[1:15:14] he began to confirm the promise to her
[1:15:16] he began to show the mystery part was
[1:15:18] her that she had to Bear the son nobody
[1:15:21] else could do it it's got to be you
[1:15:23] it's not for somebody else it's not for
[1:15:25] another age God has come in this age and
[1:15:27] he's come to us individually he said
[1:15:29] listen he's showing the sign of the
[1:15:31] Messiah it's the son of man has returned
[1:15:33] Amen in a prophetic Ministry amen
[1:15:35] showing us it's not another age it's not
[1:15:37] for somebody else it's for you
[1:15:40] all these promises are for you amen the
[1:15:42] change of the body is for you the
[1:15:44] overcoming life is for you healing's for
[1:15:46] you Deliverance is for you the change of
[1:15:48] your atoms is for you the slipping of
[1:15:50] Dimension it's all for you
[1:15:52] overcoming in Satan's eating it's for
[1:15:54] you amen
[1:15:56] oh for you amen and he showed it and
[1:15:59] then now God so graciously one by one as
[1:16:02] individuals he'll come to you
[1:16:04] individually and confirm the promise and
[1:16:06] what did it do for Sarah what it did for
[1:16:09] Sarah was gave her faith amen because
[1:16:11] the Hebrews 11 says by faith Sarah
[1:16:15] receives strength herself to conceive
[1:16:17] how did she do it by faith God needed
[1:16:20] Sarah to believe
[1:16:22] and what does God need from you and I he
[1:16:25] needs us to believe amen he needs us to
[1:16:28] believe the word for our day he needs to
[1:16:29] believe the promise that's for us he
[1:16:31] needs us not just to believe that it's
[1:16:33] for Abraham it's for Jesus Christ it's
[1:16:35] for a worldwide this no he needs that
[1:16:37] Faith to go down deeper and understand
[1:16:39] the mystery part of the prophecies the
[1:16:42] mystery part of the Bible and the
[1:16:44] Mystery part of the Bible is that I'm
[1:16:46] included
[1:16:49] that I'm part of the word and part of
[1:16:51] the prophecy amen and God is coming
[1:16:53] today Amen to to show himself to confirm
[1:16:57] the promise to show that I'm part of it
[1:16:59] to build my faith because he needs me to
[1:17:01] believe
[1:17:05] praise God Amen so now it's not just
[1:17:08] saying God sent the prophet God sent a
[1:17:10] prophet God appeared God appeared why
[1:17:11] did he appear he came to deal with the
[1:17:13] woman amen he came to deal with the
[1:17:15] mystery part he came to raise our faith
[1:17:17] he come to meet us at an appointed time
[1:17:19] Amen in a private meeting so that we can
[1:17:22] have quickened faith to believe we're
[1:17:24] part of the promise
[1:17:26] why did that Prophet come amen why did
[1:17:29] he appear in the plains of memory why
[1:17:31] did we have a repeat of the days of sun
[1:17:33] why is all this happening I don't know
[1:17:35] for you but for me it's so that I could
[1:17:37] believe that I'm part of the promise
[1:17:39] that I could believe that I'm included
[1:17:40] in this Bible
[1:17:42] it's not just for others it's for me why
[1:17:45] because he turned his back to the crowd
[1:17:47] into certain thoughts
[1:17:51] and I said that's nothing but the Lord
[1:17:54] that's him
[1:17:56] he's appearing if he's appearing these
[1:17:58] scriptures are fulfilled if these
[1:18:00] scriptures are fulfilled what what's the
[1:18:02] reason
[1:18:04] because it's time for the promise
[1:18:07] it's time for the promise and and
[1:18:09] Sarah's Got to Believe
[1:18:12] say God help me believe
[1:18:14] help me look at what you've done and
[1:18:16] recognize it and meet you personally and
[1:18:19] recognize it for me
[1:18:24] see Sarah recognizing it for Abraham
[1:18:26] didn't fulfill the promise
[1:18:29] Sarah believing Abraham should have a
[1:18:31] son and even trying to provide a means
[1:18:33] for that that didn't fulfill the promise
[1:18:36] but what fulfilled the promise is when
[1:18:39] she believed
[1:18:45] prophet of God said in the message God
[1:18:47] is his own interpreter
[1:18:50] he said now I'm claiming that he is not
[1:18:52] dead he's just as much alive today as he
[1:18:54] ever was and the Bible said Jesus said
[1:18:57] himself as it was in the days of Sodom
[1:18:59] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:19:00] of man
[1:19:01] now look no matter what kind of gift
[1:19:03] that God has up here there's got to be
[1:19:06] one down there to respond to it
[1:19:10] praise God
[1:19:13] no matter what signs are on the platform
[1:19:16] there's got to be a faith there's no he
[1:19:20] says no matter what kind of gift that
[1:19:21] God has severe there's got to be one
[1:19:23] down there to respond to it you have to
[1:19:26] have a gift too
[1:19:27] what's that gift the ability to believe
[1:19:31] you have to have something to believe
[1:19:33] with
[1:19:34] amen praise God
[1:19:37] he went to the city there was many
[1:19:39] things he could not do because of their
[1:19:42] unbelief is that right same thing today
[1:19:44] you've got to believe him you've just
[1:19:46] got to believe him that's the only way
[1:19:49] you can
[1:19:51] praise be to God and the countdown he
[1:19:54] says he is able to achieve to himself a
[1:19:57] bride he is going to in the last days
[1:20:00] he's able to get a bride that with a
[1:20:02] ministry that's so exactly like a man
[1:20:04] and his wife becomes one and when ju
[1:20:06] this is the statement I want you to lock
[1:20:08] in on for just a minute when Jehovah
[1:20:11] gets his people like him
[1:20:15] when Jehovah gets his people like him
[1:20:19] then he lives in his people they are one
[1:20:23] what's got to happen we've got to become
[1:20:25] like him
[1:20:27] and we got to be molded amen we got to
[1:20:29] be molded by his word we've got to be
[1:20:30] shaped by the word things have to be cut
[1:20:32] off of us we've got to be pliable amen
[1:20:35] under the word we've got to come into
[1:20:36] His Image and to his likeness and he
[1:20:38] says when Jehovah gets his people like
[1:20:40] him then he lives in his people they are
[1:20:44] one
[1:20:46] it fulfills the scripture exactly what
[1:20:48] he said in John 14 12. he that believeth
[1:20:51] on me the works that I do shall he also
[1:20:53] it also fulfilled that Jesus said would
[1:20:55] take place as it was in the days of
[1:20:57] Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[1:21:00] the son of man
[1:21:03] praise be to God
[1:21:07] and the message proving this word I'm
[1:21:09] going to read a quote that I've read
[1:21:10] many times so you know it don't tune out
[1:21:13] on me because you know all these words
[1:21:15] but it's so applicable here what we're
[1:21:17] talking about
[1:21:19] he's talking about the sign the time of
[1:21:23] Sodom when the world's in a condition
[1:21:24] like Sodom again in the days of lot in
[1:21:26] the days of Noah and the son of man
[1:21:28] Ministry
[1:21:30] and he says as it was in the days of
[1:21:32] Sodom now watch close in the days of
[1:21:34] Sodom so will it be at the coming of the
[1:21:36] son of man
[1:21:37] when the son of man is being revealed
[1:21:39] not no more as a church see not no more
[1:21:41] the bride is called
[1:21:43] in that day the son of man will be
[1:21:45] revealed this isn't for another church
[1:21:47] or another church age or another church
[1:21:49] this is calling out the bride
[1:21:52] because she's the mystery part that must
[1:21:54] believe her part of the word in order to
[1:21:57] come to the Fulfillment of the promise
[1:22:01] what to do what to join the church to
[1:22:03] the Head unite the marriage of the Bride
[1:22:05] the bridegroom call will come right
[1:22:07] through this when the son of man will
[1:22:09] come down and come in human flesh to
[1:22:12] unite the two together their church has
[1:22:14] to be the word he is the word and the
[1:22:16] two unite together and to do that it'll
[1:22:19] take the manifestation of the revealing
[1:22:21] of the son of man
[1:22:22] not a clergy man I don't know do you see
[1:22:25] what I mean see it's son of man amen and
[1:22:28] brother bear said he was a son of man a
[1:22:30] son of man is a prophet revealing the
[1:22:31] son of man the son of man is Jesus
[1:22:33] Christ the prophet
[1:22:35] amen it's a prophetic gift it's a
[1:22:37] prophetic sign it's a prophetic age and
[1:22:39] Christ himself came down amen through
[1:22:41] that prophetic office and he used the
[1:22:44] prophet on Earth to manifest his own
[1:22:46] Ministry
[1:22:48] misplay himself it was a son of man
[1:22:50] revealing the son of man
[1:22:55] says son of man you see what I mean it's
[1:22:59] the son of man Jesus Christ will come
[1:23:01] down in human flesh Among Us and will
[1:23:04] make his word so real that it'll unite
[1:23:06] the church in him as one the bride and
[1:23:09] then shall go home to the wedding supper
[1:23:11] amen she's already United see we go to
[1:23:14] the wedding supper not to the marriage
[1:23:18] the marriage of the Lamb has come
[1:23:23] we're in the Book of Revelation
[1:23:28] the sign of the end times have are all
[1:23:30] around us the prophecies are being
[1:23:33] fulfilled the signs that he foretold
[1:23:36] they're all here
[1:23:37] amen the the sign of the Messiah has
[1:23:41] been displayed the son of man Ministry
[1:23:43] has returned
[1:23:45] All For What
[1:23:47] because it's the time of the promise
[1:23:49] and Sarah has to believe
[1:23:54] he goes on to say the marriage of the
[1:23:56] Lamb has come but the Rapture is going
[1:23:58] to the wedding supper
[1:24:00] when the word here unites with the
[1:24:02] person and they too become one then what
[1:24:04] does it do then it manifests the son of
[1:24:07] man again
[1:24:09] not the church theologians the son of
[1:24:12] man the word and the church becomes one
[1:24:13] whatever the son of man done he was the
[1:24:15] word the church does the same thing
[1:24:19] what is it that it was a son of man
[1:24:21] revealing the son of man for what
[1:24:23] purpose so that the son of man could
[1:24:25] Unite with his bride
[1:24:28] is what he said to manifest us on a man
[1:24:30] to unite the two together
[1:24:32] so that they could unite the two
[1:24:33] together to do one so that Christ Jesus
[1:24:36] himself the son of man could display
[1:24:38] himself through his bride
[1:24:44] now I would listen to this quote
[1:24:45] carefully here and the voice of the sign
[1:24:48] says the identification of God has
[1:24:49] always been knowing can foresee what has
[1:24:52] been until what has been how is that or
[1:24:55] what will be prophetic we know that
[1:24:57] that's how the prophets was known that's
[1:24:59] how Jesus was known as the Messiah and
[1:25:02] he's the same Messiah today as he was
[1:25:04] then only without a Corporal body here
[1:25:06] on Earth
[1:25:07] he sent his Spirit back to use your body
[1:25:10] in my body
[1:25:11] now you might not be able to do this
[1:25:13] brother I was talking about his own gift
[1:25:15] as a prophet of discernment and prophecy
[1:25:17] he said he might not be able to do this
[1:25:20] we know in the scripture there's one in
[1:25:22] a generation
[1:25:24] but see but yet you can believe it and
[1:25:27] you've got other things that you can do
[1:25:29] everybody
[1:25:31] we're not trying to replicate brother
[1:25:33] banham it's because the son of man was
[1:25:34] displaying himself there and now the son
[1:25:36] of man's in the bride the son of man is
[1:25:38] in the bride globally universally not in
[1:25:41] one man
[1:25:43] he's come to unite with the bride and
[1:25:45] within us he's manifesting himself Amen
[1:25:48] in a portion that's allotted to us
[1:25:52] he says it this way in spiritual food
[1:25:54] and due season he said now if he
[1:25:56] appeared to us in a physical body look
[1:25:58] just exactly like Hoffman's head of
[1:26:00] Christ at 33 and blood running out of
[1:26:02] his hand and so forth nail scars all
[1:26:03] over him I wouldn't accept it
[1:26:07] so brother man said I wouldn't accept it
[1:26:09] because that's not how he's appearing to
[1:26:12] the Gentiles in the end time
[1:26:14] when we see him in his body of Flesh
[1:26:17] it'll be after our bodies change and we
[1:26:19] translate and we'll see him and as we
[1:26:21] translate we'll meet him in the air
[1:26:24] but it doesn't mean we can't see him
[1:26:27] because he's appearing
[1:26:31] when he comes his self
[1:26:33] every eye shall see him every tongue
[1:26:35] shall confess him as the lightning
[1:26:37] coming from the East and the West so
[1:26:38] shall it be see we don't believe these
[1:26:40] Cults and clans we believe God is the
[1:26:42] word
[1:26:43] but
[1:26:45] he embodies himself taking your body and
[1:26:49] my body and gives you gifts gives me
[1:26:51] gifts and through these gifts He makes
[1:26:54] himself known
[1:26:59] what is it
[1:27:00] Jesus Christ himself
[1:27:03] the ministry of the son of man came and
[1:27:06] displayed himself through a prophet
[1:27:08] showed the son of mess I fulfilled the
[1:27:10] prophecy showed us the age we lived in
[1:27:12] pointed out of the signs interpreted the
[1:27:15] word and broke the seals
[1:27:17] all to what so that he could Unite with
[1:27:21] you
[1:27:22] so that you could come into a union with
[1:27:24] him so that now he could live through
[1:27:27] you so he could live through his bride
[1:27:29] in the end time
[1:27:32] and what do we have to do you only have
[1:27:34] to do what he leads you to do
[1:27:37] do I have to have this manifestation of
[1:27:39] that manifestation you have to do
[1:27:41] whatever God gives you the gift to do
[1:27:43] that's what you're to do
[1:27:46] it only sends one prophet in a
[1:27:48] generation we don't all become that amen
[1:27:50] but God's called each of us into a
[1:27:52] position he's called us into a certain
[1:27:54] way amen and God wants to live his life
[1:27:56] through us
[1:27:59] it's amazing how Sarah
[1:28:02] when she was there in Genesis 18 she's
[1:28:06] there in old age she's there in
[1:28:07] disbelief not disbelieving that it's God
[1:28:10] not this believing that Abraham's right
[1:28:11] but disbelieving that she can possibly
[1:28:13] be part of the promise
[1:28:15] that it could work through her
[1:28:17] but what God does in his grace is he
[1:28:19] comes and shows the sign of the
[1:28:20] discernment to her
[1:28:22] he reveals to her the thoughts that are
[1:28:25] in her heart
[1:28:28] now it becomes personal
[1:28:32] and brother America said God embodies
[1:28:34] himself in my body and in your body
[1:28:38] and when the prophet of God was here
[1:28:40] amen he would come down and he would
[1:28:42] discern people and he would say your
[1:28:44] name is this and your address is this
[1:28:46] and before you came this morning you
[1:28:48] were kneeling or sitting at your bed
[1:28:49] facing to the east
[1:28:51] and you were praying such and such
[1:28:55] you know what that became personal
[1:28:57] God became personal
[1:29:01] ity how many times has God become
[1:29:04] personal to you
[1:29:06] through the preaching of the word
[1:29:07] through the fellowship of Believers
[1:29:10] through a song that was sung
[1:29:12] how many times has the son of man showed
[1:29:15] himself through the body
[1:29:18] how many times have you got a phone call
[1:29:20] from her brother at just the right time
[1:29:22] and they said just the right thing
[1:29:24] and there's no way for them to know
[1:29:27] how many times have you got a card in
[1:29:30] the mail or an email or a text just the
[1:29:32] right thing to say it just the right
[1:29:34] time and you know that person doesn't
[1:29:35] know
[1:29:37] how many times have you come to church
[1:29:38] and had a conversation repeated back to
[1:29:40] you from the pulpit
[1:29:42] how many times did somebody come and
[1:29:44] felt inspired to write a song they'll
[1:29:46] come up or have a song special they'll
[1:29:47] sing the song Find a song They're
[1:29:49] inspired to do it and the song will
[1:29:50] match exactly the preaching for that day
[1:29:56] he's embodying himself
[1:30:00] who is it the son of man the ministry of
[1:30:02] Jesus Christ himself where does he want
[1:30:04] to Ministry where does he want to move
[1:30:06] where does he want to work he wants to
[1:30:08] finish he wants to finish his work in
[1:30:11] Bride form
[1:30:12] he wants to finish the work in you amen
[1:30:15] he'll come down and he'll discern you
[1:30:16] he'll discern your thoughts he'll speak
[1:30:18] back to you what you said amen he'll
[1:30:20] show you what what your question is
[1:30:21] he'll answer it he'll have somebody call
[1:30:23] you somebody talk to you something will
[1:30:25] happen and all of a sudden you recognize
[1:30:26] this is personal to me God knows where I
[1:30:29] live God knows what I'm thinking God
[1:30:31] knows what I'm saying and God knows what
[1:30:33] my question is
[1:30:36] why is he doing that because he wants
[1:30:38] you to believe you're a part of the
[1:30:40] promise
[1:30:42] not just to show a sign not just to make
[1:30:44] an appearing but that you understand
[1:30:46] what they were in what age were and that
[1:30:49] God is after you too because you're part
[1:30:51] of this
[1:30:53] you're not on the sideline
[1:30:55] you're part of it
[1:30:58] let's go to Galatians chapter one
[1:31:07] Galatians chapter 1 verse 15.
[1:31:20] Galatians chapter 1.
[1:31:24] verse 15.
[1:31:26] it's the Apostle Paul speaking he says
[1:31:28] but when it pleased God who separated me
[1:31:30] from my mother's womb and called me by
[1:31:32] his grace
[1:31:33] to reveal his son in me that I might
[1:31:37] preach him among the Heathen immediately
[1:31:39] I confer not with flesh and blood
[1:31:41] Paul is saying that God separated me
[1:31:43] from my mother's womb
[1:31:45] God called me knew when I was born
[1:31:48] brought me on this Earth at a specific
[1:31:50] time
[1:31:52] then he let me go so far but at an
[1:31:54] appointed time he met me
[1:31:56] in the pillar of Fire
[1:31:59] what for to reveal his son in me
[1:32:02] all of that had a purpose not so that
[1:32:05] Paul could say I saw the pillar of fire
[1:32:06] I saw the pillar fire I saw the pillar
[1:32:08] do you know there was a pillar of fire
[1:32:10] no so that God could get his attention
[1:32:12] and bring Paul into his portion of the
[1:32:14] word so that Paul could believe amen
[1:32:17] because Paul was disbelieving the
[1:32:19] Christian message
[1:32:21] so God comes to him God calls his name
[1:32:24] God says a prophet to pray for him amen
[1:32:26] God speaks to him Amen to what to bring
[1:32:29] him in to his portion of the word
[1:32:35] and he says when it pleased God
[1:32:38] who separated me from my mother's womb
[1:32:40] and called me by his grace to reveal his
[1:32:42] son in me so where was God going to
[1:32:44] reveal the son
[1:32:46] and Paul
[1:32:48] this word revealed
[1:32:51] I think I have a definition somewhere
[1:32:55] maybe not
[1:32:57] this word reveal is the word
[1:33:00] I don't want to get it wrong
[1:33:03] yeah this word reveal
[1:33:06] is a word that's used in Peter
[1:33:09] to mean appearing
[1:33:13] I'll read it to you first Peter 1 7 that
[1:33:15] the trial of your faith being much more
[1:33:17] precious than of gold that perishes
[1:33:19] though it be tried with fire it might be
[1:33:20] found unto the praise and honor and
[1:33:23] Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[1:33:27] he says he wants to reveal his son and
[1:33:29] me he wants to appear in me
[1:33:33] this word is a apocalypsis it means
[1:33:36] Revelation manifestation coming
[1:33:39] appearing
[1:33:41] a laying bear a disclosure of Truth
[1:33:44] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ where
[1:33:47] did he want to appear
[1:33:49] and Paul
[1:33:51] where did he want to manifest himself in
[1:33:55] Paul and through Paul
[1:33:59] I love that
[1:34:01] that's a repeat of our day
[1:34:04] he revealed himself through that prophet
[1:34:09] but Paul doesn't stop there he goes down
[1:34:10] a little further if you go to Galatians
[1:34:13] chapter four
[1:34:14] and go to verse 19.
[1:34:19] in Galatians 4 19 Paul says my little
[1:34:22] children of whom I travail in birth
[1:34:24] again until Christ be formed in you
[1:34:31] Paul wasn't saying God only wants to
[1:34:34] appear in me
[1:34:35] but he's also saying I'm laboring I'm
[1:34:38] trying to bring forth the finished
[1:34:40] product that Christ will be formed in
[1:34:43] you and if Christ is formed in the
[1:34:46] church or in the bride it would be
[1:34:47] Christ in Bride form
[1:34:50] and that's what Paul was laboring that's
[1:34:52] what he was working for in laboring
[1:34:54] travailing in birth again laboring that
[1:34:57] Christ would be revealed in them it
[1:34:59] wasn't so that Paul could have it all
[1:35:00] and Paul could be the revealing and Paul
[1:35:02] could have the manifestation of Christ
[1:35:04] and Paul could have the word god
[1:35:06] appeared in Paul Amen to bring the word
[1:35:09] his appearing bringing the word amen to
[1:35:11] the Gentiles so that the Gentiles can
[1:35:14] receive Christ and Christ can be formed
[1:35:16] in them and now the appearing can be in
[1:35:18] them
[1:35:23] man God has appeared in our day
[1:35:26] you believe that
[1:35:29] I believe he wants to keep appearing
[1:35:34] he appeared in the ministry of William
[1:35:37] Branham but I believe he wants to be
[1:35:39] appearing in Bride for him
[1:35:41] declaring himself showing that it's him
[1:35:44] in her
[1:35:46] his character his life his works his
[1:35:50] attributes
[1:35:51] his deeds
[1:35:53] his surrender his obedience his love
[1:35:58] I believe he wants to show his signs
[1:36:01] I believe what Paul was laboring to do
[1:36:03] God intends to be accomplished in this
[1:36:06] day
[1:36:07] well Paul was travailing in birth to try
[1:36:09] to bring forth I believe God is bringing
[1:36:11] it forth in this hour this is the age
[1:36:13] for that but he's got to have a Sarah
[1:36:15] who will believe it
[1:36:17] he's got to have our Sarah who's had her
[1:36:20] thoughts discerned who had her questions
[1:36:22] answers he's got to have a Sarah that
[1:36:24] has seen a living God a real God a
[1:36:27] manifestation of God an appearing of God
[1:36:29] who also can come into a private meeting
[1:36:32] with God and realize by faith that it's
[1:36:34] got to be me this has got to be I've got
[1:36:37] to be part of it it's not going anywhere
[1:36:39] without me
[1:36:40] laughs
[1:36:42] amen that's not arrogacy that's Faith
[1:36:44] that's faith in recognizing your
[1:36:45] position and all of a sudden you say I
[1:36:48] have got to surrender myself more
[1:36:49] because it's not going anywhere without
[1:36:51] me I'm part of the promise
[1:36:54] I've Got to Believe
[1:36:58] prophet of God says God's body
[1:37:00] United as his bride being one him and
[1:37:03] Christ together is the spirit working in
[1:37:05] the flesh of the church like it worked
[1:37:07] in the flesh of Jesus Christ
[1:37:09] because it's part of his body not Twain
[1:37:11] but one they are one husband and wife is
[1:37:13] no longer Twain but one and Christ in
[1:37:15] his body is one and the Same Spirit was
[1:37:18] in Christ is in his bride and his body
[1:37:20] that unites them together with all the
[1:37:22] word and God living in their himself
[1:37:25] manifesting it
[1:37:28] oh
[1:37:30] Paul was laboring
[1:37:33] he was the foundation Paul said I laid
[1:37:35] the foundation
[1:37:37] as a wise master builder I laid the
[1:37:39] foundation a foundation for what a
[1:37:41] foundation for a bride
[1:37:43] I laid the foundation he said be careful
[1:37:46] how you build watch do how you build on
[1:37:48] this
[1:37:49] the seven churches The Messengers have
[1:37:51] been building on it
[1:37:53] but by the grace of God we're in the
[1:37:55] Capstone age in the completion what he
[1:37:57] was laboring for is to be birthed amen
[1:38:00] Christ will be formed and you and I
[1:38:06] in the message shalom
[1:38:08] Prophet says now I say to the church
[1:38:10] Shalom God's peace
[1:38:13] every true Hebrew when he meets another
[1:38:15] one Shalom other words good morning
[1:38:18] God be with you God's peace go with you
[1:38:21] it's a good morning how do you do it's a
[1:38:23] breaking day church it's Darkness upon
[1:38:26] the people but it's good morning to the
[1:38:27] church
[1:38:29] the world's in darkness laodicea is in
[1:38:31] darkness Sodom condition but oh praise
[1:38:34] God he's appeared to us the light has
[1:38:36] come
[1:38:38] it's a good morning to the church Christ
[1:38:41] is appearing Among Us
[1:38:44] Shalom peace Hallelujah shalom
[1:38:48] when we see Darkness settling Darkness
[1:38:50] just before day we know that the morning
[1:38:52] star is hanging Yonder to introduce the
[1:38:54] coming Sun
[1:38:55] it's that's when the Morning Star shines
[1:38:57] it's the going between It's always
[1:38:59] darkest just a few minutes before day
[1:39:01] the blackout comes the moon fails to
[1:39:03] shine the darkest before day is becoming
[1:39:05] the light because the light is pressing
[1:39:07] the darkness but the Morning Star comes
[1:39:09] out and says good morning shalom
[1:39:13] that's him Among Us his word being
[1:39:16] identified shalom
[1:39:19] I ask you as have you seen the appearing
[1:39:22] of the Lord
[1:39:23] has he appeared in our generation
[1:39:27] did you see him working through that
[1:39:29] Prophet did you see the same signs did
[1:39:31] you see the prophecy fulfilled
[1:39:34] praise God did you see the repeat of the
[1:39:36] planes of memory
[1:39:38] then praise God
[1:39:40] let's let that produce What It produced
[1:39:43] back there let it produce that in me
[1:39:47] God came in that day to deal with the
[1:39:50] mystery part
[1:39:51] he's coming this day to deal with this
[1:39:53] mystery point
[1:39:55] to bring me out of spiritual Amnesia to
[1:39:57] bring me out of church confusion to
[1:40:00] bring me into the understanding of who I
[1:40:02] really am and what he intends to do with
[1:40:03] me in this day
[1:40:05] to snap me out and bring me back
[1:40:08] let that appearing work that goal to
[1:40:12] bring Faith to say Here I Am Lord being
[1:40:16] unto me according to your word
[1:40:19] God is good friends
[1:40:21] we've seen his appearing
[1:40:24] I wonder if we can go a little deeper
[1:40:27] I wonder if we're still seeing his
[1:40:29] appearing
[1:40:31] we look around we Fellowship we see the
[1:40:35] word changing people's lives
[1:40:38] see the illumination of the Gospel
[1:40:40] coming out of a Brother's mouth coming
[1:40:42] out of his sister's mouth coming out of
[1:40:44] their conduct their character glowing
[1:40:46] with the character of Christ
[1:40:49] we saw him appear
[1:40:51] but are we seeing him appear
[1:40:54] I want to see him still appearing
[1:40:57] I want him to be appearing in me
[1:40:59] I want to be yielded and surrendered and
[1:41:01] I want this word to bring a life out of
[1:41:04] me
[1:41:05] all I can say is Here I Am Lord
[1:41:08] I believe it
[1:41:10] I believe it I don't know how but I
[1:41:13] believe it
[1:41:14] I'm not worthy but I believe it I'm not
[1:41:16] capable but I believe it look at Sarah
[1:41:18] she wasn't worthy she was not capable
[1:41:20] she she did she tried to lie in the face
[1:41:22] of God but it didn't change her position
[1:41:24] in the word
[1:41:26] we failed a million times we may fail a
[1:41:29] thousand more before the year is over
[1:41:31] with but it doesn't change anything by
[1:41:33] Revelation I see my position in the
[1:41:35] prophecy I see my position in the word
[1:41:37] and all I can say is being unto me
[1:41:40] according to your word Lord all I know
[1:41:42] to say is here I am God use me
[1:41:46] Purge me cleanse me shape me by your
[1:41:48] word and use Me For Your Glory
[1:41:51] I'm laying down my life because I
[1:41:53] believe that I'm part of your bride
[1:41:57] and I believe that I'm United with you
[1:41:59] and I believe you want to live through
[1:42:01] me
[1:42:02] and I want to give you that right
[1:42:05] amen let's all Stand Together
[1:42:08] oh this word is so tremendous
[1:42:12] it's so beautiful
[1:42:14] and I'm just so thankful that God let me
[1:42:17] hear it
[1:42:19] listen
[1:42:20] just to hear the word of God as a
[1:42:22] privilege
[1:42:24] when there's darkness in the world
[1:42:26] there's a famine not for in the food or
[1:42:28] water but a famine for hearing the word
[1:42:30] of God just to hear it is a tremendous
[1:42:34] I'm so glad he let me hear it
[1:42:36] and then a Step Beyond that I'm so glad
[1:42:38] he put something in me by predestination
[1:42:40] that could believe it

[1:44:30] church system we would have been who
[1:44:31] knows where we would have been
[1:44:33] but God you made sure that we saw your
[1:44:35] appearing
[1:44:36] you made sure that we came in contact
[1:44:39] with the Living God with the word made
[1:44:42] flesh in our day so that we could hear
[1:44:44] it that we could see it we could hear
[1:44:46] the testimonies that we could know it's
[1:44:48] real
[1:44:49] God that's your grace and mercy in our
[1:44:51] lives
[1:44:53] we could have so easily walked by and
[1:44:55] never known what you had done in this
[1:44:56] generation
[1:44:57] we could have continued on in religion
[1:44:59] we could have continued on on our

[1:45:13] each one of us and we saw your appearing
[1:45:15] we wouldn't be here if we didn't
[1:45:19] oh God that appearing produced something
[1:45:21] in Sarah
[1:45:23] you begin to deal with her on a personal
[1:45:25] level and you begin to bring her into
[1:45:27] the prophecy and you begin to change her
[1:45:30] so that she would be able to bring forth
[1:45:33] the son
[1:45:35] God in the appointed time
[1:45:37] you showed yourself to her and made it
[1:45:39] personal
[1:45:40] and in the appointed time you went to
[1:45:42] her personally
[1:45:43] in a personal visitation
[1:45:46] and out of that she received Faith by
[1:45:49] faith she received strength to conceive

[1:53:24] thought the Levi I thought there might
[1:53:25] be one more maybe two more
[1:53:27] then after I talked in this morning I
[1:53:29] figured it was three more so there was
[1:53:30] four baptisms
[1:53:32] then the sister of the sister would like
[1:53:34] to be baptized during the service she
[1:53:35] decided she'd like to be baptized
[1:53:38] and then by the end of the service Boaz
