[0:00] oh my I think that the third pull has
[0:02] something to do with the word coming to
[0:04] the prophet and that word coming to the
[0:06] prophet brings us into an individual
[0:09] introduction to Jesus Christ the same
[0:11] way Paul met him amen spiritual union he
[0:14] met him as a pillar of fire on the road
[0:16] to Damascus and now that presence was in
[0:18] that room and they went in one by one
[0:20] this isn't church this isn't group this
[0:22] isn't family this is you coming in
[0:24] contact in the third pool with Christ
[0:27] himself The Living Word of God God and
[0:30] when you meet Christ in the little room
[0:33] amen it's not a public show amen it's
[0:35] not anything somebody can copy it's not
[0:37] anything that even anybody can explain
[0:39] it's not to be replicated it's not to be
[0:41] a formula it's to be a living reality
[0:44] inside of you that you have come in
[0:46] contact with the person of the third
[0:48] pool which is the word that has been
[0:49] restored in this
[0:51] hour and it changes
[0:54] you everybody in that line is Afflicted
[0:57] with some sort of Affliction crutches
[0:58] and wheelchair and all of that but they
[1:00] come out and she's pushing the the
[1:02] wheelchair the man in the crutches
[1:04] doesn't need his crutches anymore amen
[1:06] listen don't think physical think
[1:11] spiritual if you're looking for the
[1:13] third pool to produce a prayer line
[1:15] where people don't need crutches and
[1:16] wheelchairs anymore listen God has
[1:18] already done that he did that in the
[1:20] first and second pull that's not the
[1:22] third pull the third pull goes deeper
[1:24] than flesh the third pole is fixing your
[1:26] spiritual condition the afflictions to
[1:29] the soul what was holding us back where
[1:31] the Holy Ghost had been bound by these
[1:33] denominational Rivers for all this time
[1:35] but is loosed in the evening time by the
[1:37] evening time message the Holy Ghost
[1:39] backing the people your spiritual
[1:41] condition that came through the church
[1:42] AIDS and den nomination and man's ideas
[1:45] and all kinds of confusion is under this
[1:47] third pool going to be
[1:53] healed brother Brandon went through the
[1:55] third pool do you believe that yes do
[1:58] you believe he was in a little room all
[1:59] by himself when the angel came to him
[2:01] every day amen said I've been alone in
[2:05] that little
[2:09] room and he come out on the other side
[2:11] and he said my Bible's a new
[2:13] book something changed in him
[2:17] spiritually he was the same stature he
[2:19] was still baldheaded he was still 50
[2:21] some years
[2:22] old amen he would go on to say uh uh I'm
[2:26] getting old now that brother gave me a a
[2:28] cane looks like I'm I have to use it now
[2:31] after the seals he says I wake up and
[2:32] you always got a new pain a new Creek
[2:34] and new that he still had a nervous
[2:36] condition he still got the blues he
[2:38] still had tension he still got
[2:41] depressed so the third pole is not
[2:44] fixing all of your natural problems
[2:46] you're still living a natural life the
[2:47] third pole is fixing your spiritual
[2:50] problem it's fixing the soul it's
[2:52] bringing you back into what God always
[2:54] meant for you to be a son or daughter of
[2:57] God it's Awakening what woken sham gar
[3:00] what was awakened David amen under the
[3:02] anointing of this prophetic Ministry
[3:04] it's bringing you to the realization of
[3:05] who you are and what you're destined for
[3:08] you're anointed to be the Bride of Jesus
[3:10] Christ you're anointed to be the queen
[3:12] that sits with him and rules and
[3:15] Reigns and now while I'm coming into
[3:17] that position I know who I am I know
[3:20] where I'm at I know the word that's
[3:22] promised to me and if I face Goliath I
[3:25] can face Goliath because I know who I
[3:28] am that's the true
