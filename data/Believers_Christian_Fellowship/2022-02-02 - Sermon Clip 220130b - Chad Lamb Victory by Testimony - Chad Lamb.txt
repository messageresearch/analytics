TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i remember the testimony of sister viola yingst and sister viola yanks you know she she went through the prayer line on her 40th birthday in july i believe in 1963 in the message i think if i i i might have it wrong but i think it's he cares do you care and if you listen to that tape the first person through the prayer line is sister viola ying she had prayer card number one on her 40th birthday and she goes through the prayer line and there's several things amen that was going on in life and brother ben begins to discern i see you have a thyroid condition i see a doctor and you've got spiritual troubles you don't know whether you're in you don't know whether you're out and that was because she was just coming to the message and the rest of her family wasn't seeing it yet and she was on thyroid medication and he says i see you holding your head i may not be quoting this exactly right but but you understand you've got bad headaches and sister viola told me that brother ben prayed for her and she left she said instantly she quit taking her thyroid medicine and had no more problems with her thyroid that moment and then her and brother ed got a revelation of the message together and and the family come to the message together and the spiritual trouble settled out but she said she had to wait multiple years before she was finally delivered of migraine headaches and some of the family here might remember i don't remember but it was years and years and years it was a long time and it was the same sister coming before the same prophet believing the same word and having the same prayer one is healed instantly one is he uh one comes one deliverance comes shortly thereafter and one she has to wait for multiple years before it's fulfilled i say sister viola yinks is going to be able to stand on that day and say mr impatient you're wrong you're wrong abraham's going to be able to stand and say mr impatient you're wrong 25 years i waited but god was true to his word amen mr impatient you're wrong sister viola can say mr impatient you're wrong brother bernie can say mr impatient you're wrong brother bernie got a terrible case of shingles that left him with nerve damage and he had pain for years amen he prayed believed god was anointed with oil and stood by his confession and after five years god removes it in a moment with no explanation it's not explainable how it went away even the doctor told brother bernie that it doesn't that doesn't see any way that you'll be healed you'll probably live this way because these things there's no there was no healing that the doctors could give for that what do you say brother bernie is mr impatient wrong he's wrong he's wrong he's a liar praise be to god these this mr impatient whispers in your ear this mr skeptic comes in worship whispers in your ear this mr unbeliever comes and worships in your ear trying to get you to deviate off the word of god and lose confidence
