[3:07] There's a blessed time that's coming
[3:09] coming soon.
[3:12] It may be morning, evening, night or
[3:15] noon.
[3:17] To the wedding of the bride, united with
[3:21] the groom. We shall see the king when he
[3:25] comes.
[3:28] We shall see the king. We shall see the
[3:32] king. We shall see the king when he
[3:35] comes.
[3:38] He's coming and power will hail. Blessed
[3:42] hour we shall see the king when he
[3:46] comes.
[3:48] Are you ready? Should the savior call
[3:50] today?
[3:53] When Jesus say well done or go away.
[3:58] My home is for the pure. The wild can
[4:02] never stay. We shall see the king when
[4:06] he comes.
[4:08] We shall see the king. We shall see the
[4:12] king. We shall see the king when he
[4:16] comes.
[4:18] He's coming in and power will hail the
[4:22] blessed hour. We shall see the king when
[4:26] he comes.
[4:28] Oh my brother, are you ready for the
[4:31] call
[4:33] to crown our savior, king and lord of
[4:36] all?
[4:38] The kingom of this world shall soon
[4:42] before him fall. We shall see the king
[4:46] when he comes.
[4:49] We shall see the king. We shall see the
[4:52] king. We shall see the king when he
[4:56] comes.
[4:58] He's coming and power will hail the
[5:02] blessed hour. We shall see the king when
[5:06] he comes.
[5:09] In the blessed time that king
[5:14] was the chosen who received the call.
[5:18] It was the wedding of the bride united
[5:22] with the groom. We have seen the king
[5:26] since he came.
[5:28] Oh, we shall see the king. We shall see
[5:32] the king. We shall see the king when he
[5:36] comes.
[5:39] He's coming and power will hail the
[5:42] blessed hour. We shall see the king when
[5:46] he comes.
[5:50] Amen. It's good to be with you this
[5:51] evening. Let's go to the key of G. Thank
[5:53] God I am free.
[5:56] For a long time I traveled
[6:01] down a long lonely road.
[6:07] My heart was so heavy in sin I sang.
[6:14] Then I heard about Jesus.
[6:19] What a wonderful hour.
[6:24] I'm so glad that I found out he could
[6:28] bring me out through his saving power.
[6:34] Thank God I am free. Free. Free from
[6:40] this world of sin.
[6:44] I've been washed in the blood of Jesus.
[6:48] I've been born again.
[6:53] Hallelujah. I'm saved. Saved. Saved by
[6:58] his wonderful grace.
[7:03] I'm so glad that I found out he could
[7:07] bring me out. Show me the way.
[7:13] Like a bird out of prison
[7:18] that's taking it.
[7:23] Like a blind man that God gave back his
[7:27] son.
[7:30] Like a poor wretched beggar
[7:35] that's found fortune and fame.
[7:40] I'm so glad that I found out he could
[7:44] bring me out through his holy name.
[7:50] Thank God I am free. Free. Free from
[7:56] this world of sin.
[8:00] I've been washed in the blood of Jesus.
[8:04] I've been born again.
[8:09] Hallelujah. I'm saved. Save
[8:14] by his wonderful grace.
[8:19] I'm so glad that I found out he could
[8:22] bring me out. Show me the way.
[8:30] Oh Lord, I want to love you more.
[8:35] more
[8:38] than I ever had before.
[8:44] You're so easy to adore.
[8:51] Lord, I want to love you more.
[8:59] Lord, I want to praise you more
[9:06] than I ever have before.
[9:13] You're so worthy to be praised.
[9:20] Lord, I want to praise you more.
[9:24] I want to give you all.
[9:27] Lord, I want to give you more
[9:34] than I ever have before.
[9:41] You're the one I'm living for.
[9:48] Lord, I want to give you more. I want to
[9:51] praise you.
[9:54] And Lord, I want to praise you more
[10:02] than I ever have before.
[10:09] You're so worthy to be praised.
[10:16] Lord, I want to praise you more. I want
[10:20] to love you,
[10:23] Lord. I want to love you more
[10:30] than I ever have before.
[10:37] You're so easy to adore.
[10:44] Lord, I want to love you more.
[10:52] I love you, Lord,
[10:58] and I lift my voice
[11:08] to worship
[11:13] you,
[11:15] oh my soul.
[11:20] Rejoice.
[11:24] Take joy my king
[11:30] in
[11:32] what you hear.
[11:39] Make me a sweet,
[11:43] sweet
[11:45] sound
[11:47] in your ear. Would you stand with me
[11:50] this evening?
[11:54] And I love
[11:58] you, Lord.
[12:02] And I live my voice.
[12:08] voice
[12:12] to worship
[12:16] you
[12:18] oh my soul
[12:23] rejoice
[12:28] joy my king
[12:33] in
[12:35] what
[12:36] you here.
[12:42] May it be a sweet,
[12:46] sweet
[12:48] sound
[12:50] in your ear.
[12:56] As brother Chad comes this morning or
[12:59] this evening, there is none like you.
[13:07] No one else can touch my heart like you
[13:12] do.
[13:15] I could search for all eternity,
[13:20] Lord,
[13:21] and find there is none like you.
[13:30] There is none
[13:33] like you.
[13:38] No one else can touch my heart like you
[13:42] do.
[13:45] I could search for all eternity,
[13:50] Lord,
[13:51] and find there is none like you.
[14:01] There is none like you.
[14:05] None like you. No one else can touch my
[14:11] heart like you do.
[14:15] I could search for all eternity,
[14:20] Lord,
[14:22] and find there is none like you.
[14:30] Amen. Let's bow our heads together this
[14:32] evening.
[14:33] Lord Jesus, there is truly none like
[14:36] you. And God, we're so thankful, God,
[14:39] that you've given us a voice that can
[14:42] sing your praises. You've given us hands
[14:44] we can lift to you and surrender. Given
[14:47] us a place to gather and an opportunity
[14:50] to come and praise your name. For God,
[14:52] we are so thankful for all that you've
[14:55] done for us. We love you so much. You've
[14:58] been so good. We just want to sing it.
[15:00] We just want to say it. We just want to
[15:02] surrender, Lord, in your presence and
[15:04] let you have more of us, Lord. That we
[15:07] would just surrender more and lay
[15:08] ourselves at your feet and pour
[15:10] ourselves out to you. That you might
[15:12] pour yourself into us. That you might
[15:15] take a greater portion than you've ever
[15:16] had and have more liberty in our lives
[15:19] and use us for your plan in this end
[15:21] time. get glory in these vessels of
[15:24] clay. For you purchased us with your own
[15:26] blood. May you use us, indwell us, Lord,
[15:29] and reflect your life through us. God, I
[15:32] pray you'd come now and minister to us,
[15:35] Lord, according to your method, Lord,
[15:37] through the foolishness of preaching.
[15:39] May you come and break the bread of life
[15:41] as we surrender to you. May you teach us
[15:43] and instruct us out of your word. May we
[15:45] leave here, Lord, equipped, taught,
[15:47] instructed in the ways of righteousness.
[15:50] We love you. We surrender all to you and
[15:52] ask you take preeminence now. In Jesus
[15:55] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[15:59] Amen. God bless you all this evening. If
[16:01] you'd like to take your Bibles with me,
[16:03] we'll turn to Proverbs chapter 17.
[16:07] Amen. I just want to say how much I
[16:08] enjoyed this past Sunday with brother
[16:10] Isaiah Brooks. It was quite a refreshing
[16:13] service for me and it was like brother
[16:15] Isaiah came and fan the flames once
[16:18] again. Amen. And it was it was a
[16:20] blessing. Amen. I rejoiced in it and
[16:22] I've been chewing on it since then.
[16:25] Amen. Also, I wanted to let you know
[16:27] that brother Eugene Braun will be coming
[16:29] our way next month. I was able to secure
[16:31] dates with him last week. February 14th
[16:34] and 15th. He'll be here. Uh February
[16:37] 14th is Saturday. And we're going to do
[16:40] a couple service for all married couples
[16:42] here in the sanctuary at 3 p.m. So next
[16:46] month, February 14th, for all married
[16:48] couples with brother Eugene Bronn will
[16:49] be here in the sanctuary. And then
[16:52] Sunday the 15th will be our our
[16:53] regularly scheduled Sunday service and
[16:55] he'll be taking that service for us. So
[16:57] I'm looking forward to that. So be in
[16:59] prayer for that and uh uh be praying for
[17:02] brother Eugene as well. And then also I
[17:05] wanted to let you know that next
[17:06] Wednesday night, January 28th, I'm going
[17:08] to start our tape service. So every
[17:10] winter we like to do a tape. I'm going
[17:12] to do two this year because the first
[17:14] one I want to do is a really short one,
[17:16] but it's been on my heart for some time
[17:17] to do it. And I tried to get books from
[17:20] Brother John, but they had a limited
[17:21] number that we could get. But I I just
[17:23] feel to do the tape anyways. We're going
[17:25] to have maybe uh we can have it in our
[17:28] tablets, our phones. We'll have a few
[17:29] books. We'll have it on the overhead.
[17:31] But I want to do the tape. So, I want to
[17:33] start with the tape, a guide next
[17:35] Wednesday. It'll take us two Wednesdays
[17:36] to do that. So, be praying for that and
[17:38] be looking forward to that as well. I
[17:40] look forward to it every year. And so,
[17:42] I'm excited to do that together. And
[17:44] this one in particular has just been
[17:46] stirring in my heart for some time. And
[17:48] so, I'm excited to get to that. Amen.
[17:51] So, be praying about all of those
[17:52] things. Uh, Proverbs 17
[17:56] verse 17. And we'll read just one
[17:58] scripture while we're yet standing.
[18:00] Proverbs 17:17.
[18:02] A friend loveth at all times, and a
[18:05] brother is born for adversity. Amen. God
[18:08] bless you. As you have your seats. Amen.
[18:11] Don't know that I've ever opened a
[18:12] service with that scripture. Amen. But
[18:15] uh if we go ahead and pull the
[18:16] PowerPoint up, I want to preach on the
[18:18] subject. A friend loveth at all times.
[18:21] Amen. And uh I've uh been meditating on
[18:23] this for quite a while. There's been a
[18:25] subject I've talked to several people
[18:26] about. I've been threatening to preach
[18:28] this for months. Amen. Maybe even more
[18:30] than months. And it's just a thought
[18:32] that I've been meditating on and finally
[18:33] I got a bit of inspiration. And it was
[18:36] interesting because remember the story I
[18:38] told you when brother Chris take was
[18:40] here how no inspiration it was all dried
[18:42] up and I got the text from him and we
[18:44] switched it around. He took the service.
[18:46] Well, I said as soon as he agreed to
[18:48] take the service, the inspiration
[18:49] started flowing. Well, it started
[18:50] flowing for this service. And so I
[18:53] started I started getting the
[18:54] inspiration and and putting some notes
[18:56] together. And then I was going to preach
[18:57] it last Wednesday, but last Wednesday
[19:00] that was canceled because of snow. But
[19:02] what was funny is brother Chris Tate
[19:04] came and when he preached there was a
[19:05] couple statements he made that was
[19:07] exactly in line with what I wanted to
[19:09] preach on this subject. So to me it was
[19:10] like praise God it's a confirmation. And
[19:12] then we get to this Sunday and brother
[19:14] Isaiah Brooks took a just a minute or
[19:17] two and started hitting right on the
[19:19] same subject. I said well praise God
[19:20] that's another confirmation for me. So
[19:23] it's a very simple subject. I just want
[19:25] to teach on it. Amen. And pray that God
[19:27] will just feed us on his word. Amen. So,
[19:30] a friend loveth at all times. Amen.
[19:32] That's what I want to focus on is a
[19:35] friend loveth at all times. Uh I've got
[19:38] quite a few scriptures to go to, but
[19:39] they're all on the PowerPoint, so I've
[19:41] put it all on there so we can make some
[19:43] progress.
[19:45] Amen. Proverbs 18:24.
[19:48] A man that hath friends must show
[19:50] himself friendly, and there is a friend
[19:52] that stickketh closer than a brother. So
[19:55] this whole service, don't wait for me to
[19:57] start getting to the real deep stuff
[19:58] because we're just teaching a subject
[20:00] and we're teaching on being a good
[20:02] friend.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; So if you want to know where we're
[20:04] going, that's it. From beginning to end,
[20:07] we're going to teach on what it means to
[20:08] be a good friend because a friend loveth
[20:10] at all times.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so a friend must show himself
[20:14] friendly. And there is a friend that
[20:16] stickketh closer than a brother. Amen.
[20:18] We know that ultimate friend is Christ
[20:20] Jesus. But but there's friends. We have
[20:22] friends that sticketh closer than
[20:24] brother a brother. Brother Brandham or
[20:26] Ecclesiastes 4:9 says, "Two are better
[20:29] than one because they have a good reward
[20:31] for their labor. For if they fall, the
[20:34] one will lift up his fellow, but woe to
[20:36] him that is alone when he fall, for
[20:38] heath not another to help him up."
[20:40] Again, if two lie together, then they
[20:42] have heat. But how can one be warm
[20:44] alone? And if one prevail against him,
[20:46] two shall withstand him, and a
[20:48] three-fold cord is not quickly broken.
[20:51] This whole concept of being a good
[20:53] friend and having a friend is run
[20:55] through the whole scripture. It's
[20:56] amazing when you start thinking about
[20:57] it. It's everywhere in the Bible. Amen.
[21:00] And and the Ecclesiastes tells us it's
[21:02] better, two are better than one. It's
[21:04] better to have a friend. It's better to
[21:06] have one that's with you in a time of
[21:08] need than to be all alone. Amen. But to
[21:12] have friends, you must show yourself
[21:13] friendly. Amen. So to have friends, you
[21:15] must be a friend.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; So to have one in your time of need, you
[21:18] must be one in a time of need.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's what brother Benham says.
[21:24] And wouldn't it be good if all God's
[21:26] sheep when the heat was on would stand
[21:29] together? When the trials are real hard
[21:32] and the heat is on and everything going
[21:34] on everywhere, if all of God's little
[21:36] sheep would just stand together, we'd
[21:38] have the coolness of shade of each
[21:40] other, the comfort to lean upon each
[21:42] other. Now, someone said, "Is that
[21:44] necessary, Brother Brandham?" It
[21:46] certainly is. There is nothing like
[21:49] having a real good, dependable friend
[21:51] that when the troubles are blazing, the
[21:53] heat's on, you can go to this friend and
[21:55] sit down and just explain it to them,
[21:58] talk it over in personal confidence, and
[22:00] then kneel down and pray together and
[22:02] know that this person is a good,
[22:05] God-saved man or woman that you can put
[22:07] confidence in. Oh, it's good to do that.
[22:11] It's good to have a friend. It's good to
[22:13] have somebody have confidence in. It's
[22:15] good to bear one another's burdens.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; It's a good thing. Amen. But I want to
[22:19] talk about how to do that. And and and
[22:22] we'll you'll see where we're going as we
[22:24] keep moving forward. Amen. Because
[22:26] there's a lot of instruction in the
[22:27] scripture. Hebrews 10, we know this
[22:30] scripture well. says, "Let us hold fast
[22:32] the profession of our faith without
[22:34] wavering, for he is faithful that
[22:36] promised, and let us consider one
[22:38] another to provoke unto love and to good
[22:42] works, not forsaking the ascending of
[22:44] ourselves together, as the manner of
[22:46] some is, but exhorting one another and
[22:48] so much more as you see the day
[22:51] approaching." Amen. The Bible tells us
[22:53] to come together,
[22:55] &gt;&gt; spend time together, don't forsake the
[22:57] assembling of ourselves together. Amen.
[22:59] as this manner of some is, but exhorting
[23:02] one another and so much more as you see
[23:05] the day approaching. Do we see the day
[23:06] approaching?
[23:07] &gt;&gt; Then this should be more and more. But
[23:09] it says, "Consider, let us consider one
[23:11] another to provoke unto love and good
[23:14] works." And I love this word provoke.
[23:16] And I love the definition. Amen. If we
[23:18] look at the meaning at the bottom, it
[23:20] says an inciting, an incitement, an
[23:22] irritation.
[23:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; Let's irritate each other into love and
[23:31] good works.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I love it. Sometimes when you
[23:35] look up a definition, YOU'RE LIKE,
[23:36] "WHAT? HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?" AMEN. But
[23:40] the reality is, if a friend loveth at
[23:43] all times, Amen. What will our love do?
[23:45] And what is the product of our love? We
[23:47] want to see the very best for a friend.
[23:49] Amen. And we want to see them progress
[23:51] in the things of God. We want to see
[23:53] them moving forward. Amen. We don't want
[23:55] to just pander to them. We want to just
[23:56] pet them and stroke them. A mean. We
[23:58] want to be kind and loving, but we want
[24:00] to do that which is best for them. And
[24:02] we want to kind of uh uh uh move them
[24:04] along, push them, go them, poke them,
[24:06] prod them a little bit and say, "Hey,
[24:08] hey, I haven't seen you in a while. How
[24:10] are you doing spiritually? What's going
[24:11] on in your life?"
[24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people get so offended at
[24:16] that. Amen. They they if they haven't
[24:18] seen you in a couple services and
[24:20] somebody says, "Hey, I haven't seen you.
[24:21] Is everything okay?" People get so
[24:23] offended. Why are you checking on me?
[24:25] I'M FINE. LISTEN, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
[24:27] SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. That's exactly
[24:29] what we're there's a brotherhood for.
[24:31] That's why we're sheep. That's why we
[24:33] bind ourselves together. We're here to
[24:35] bear one another's burdens. We're here
[24:37] to be our brother's keeper. We're here
[24:39] to check on ONE ANOTHER. THAT'S WHAT
[24:41] WE'RE HERE FOR. LET'S NOT GET OFFENDED.
[24:43] AMEN. AS soon as you get offended and
[24:44] bristle up when somebody asks where
[24:46] YOU'VE BEEN, AMEN, RIGHT OFF, ALARM GO
[24:48] BELLS go off. There's something wrong
[24:49] there. Amen.
[24:51] &gt;&gt; I mean, if somebody comes to you and
[24:52] starts heaping condemnation, now that's
[24:54] a different problem. But if somebody
[24:55] genuinely in love says, "Is everything
[24:57] okay, brother?"
[24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we got to be careful how we
[25:01] go. Don't go assuming that you're you're
[25:03] the you're the uh church attendance
[25:05] police and you're going to fix them up
[25:06] cuz you're going to walk away with your
[25:08] hat and your hand and your and your shoe
[25:10] in your foot or your foot in your mouth.
[25:11] Sorry. You should have your shoe in your
[25:14] foot or your foot in your shoe
[25:17] because you'll find out somebody's been
[25:19] sick or they've had a death in the
[25:20] family. They've been taken care of a
[25:22] sick elderly. You got to be careful that
[25:23] you don't have it all figured out that
[25:25] you actually go in love and concern and
[25:27] find out what's going on.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. But don't go to be the one to tell
[25:33] them the truth. And
[25:36] &gt;&gt; because a friend loveth at all time.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we speak, we speak out of
[25:41] love. When we ask, we ask out of love.
[25:43] When we're concerned, we're concerned
[25:44] out of love.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; And we're supposed to provoke
[25:53] one another into love and good works.
[25:55] We're supposed to encourage each other
[25:57] to keep moving forward. Amen. To to not
[26:00] let anybody fall behind and fall back.
[26:02] But that's why we're a body. That's what
[26:04] we're supposed to do. This word
[26:07] exhorting, but exhorting one another.
[26:10] This word exhorting means to admonish,
[26:13] to console, to encourage, to strengthen
[26:16] by consolation, to encourage, to
[26:18] strengthen, to instruct, to teach. So,
[26:21] we're supposed to uh provoke, amen, one
[26:24] another, and to love and good works, to
[26:26] keep each other moving forward. But
[26:28] we're also to exhort one another, to
[26:30] encourage, to strengthen, to instruct,
[26:32] to admonish, amen, to encourage by
[26:35] consolation. Amen. To to to do that for
[26:37] our brothers and our sisters. That's
[26:40] what a friend does.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. A friend is not just somebody
[26:45] who's syrupy, sweet, nice, and
[26:47] complimentary all the time.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; That's an associate. That's not a
[26:53] friend.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; But a friend can ask you the hard
[26:57] questions.
[26:58] &gt;&gt; A real friend can.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; Just a casual associate can't get by
[27:02] with that. But a real friend can ask the
[27:05] hard questions.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. As iron sharpeneth iron, so a man
[27:10] sharpeneth the countenance of his
[27:12] friend.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; That's another good one.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; That's like provoke.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Cuz how does iron sharpen an iron? I
[27:20] mean, it's it's Yeah.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Anybody sharpen a knife?
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Anybody use a file?
[27:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, if you've ever done
[27:29] that, you know, you're you're scraping
[27:31] metal against metal and taking the burrs
[27:33] and the rough edges off and sharpening
[27:35] that knife. Amen. through a bit of
[27:37] abrasion and a bit of a rubbing. And as
[27:39] iron sharpeneth iron, so a man
[27:42] sharpeneth the countenance of his
[27:43] friends. What's the point of having a
[27:45] friend is your friendship. Does it make
[27:47] you better?
[27:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[27:51] &gt;&gt; We should be We should have friends who
[27:53] make us better. Friends who provoke us
[27:55] to go higher. Friends who encourage us.
[27:57] Friends who stand by us. Friends who
[27:59] love us. Friends who have a right to ask
[28:01] us hard questions.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if we don't have a friend like
[28:06] that, we don't have a friend.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; We have an associate. We have somebody
[28:11] that we know in a group setting, but not
[28:14] a friend. And we need a friend.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus was a good friend.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; He told his disciples, he called them
[28:21] friends, but did he ever rebuke them?
[28:24] &gt;&gt; Oh man,
[28:26] &gt;&gt; he did.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; But he was a friend.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; And he loved at all times. Right?
[28:32] &gt;&gt; In Proverbs, it says, "Open rebuke is
[28:36] better than secret love.
[28:39] Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but
[28:42] the kisses of enemy are deceit."
[28:46] &gt;&gt; I love this. Faithful are the wounds of
[28:48] a friend.
[28:50] That's amazing. Has anybody ever had a
[28:53] friend call you out when you weren't
[28:57] thinking, weren't doing, weren't acting
[28:58] right? Mhm.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; Did it hurt?
[29:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope you appreciate it.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; I've learned to appreciate it. I've had
[29:10] a friends who've have called me out.
[29:12] Amen. I've had friends who've asked hard
[29:14] questions and friends who pointed out
[29:16] discrepancies in my life or
[29:17] discrepancies in my conduct. Amen. And
[29:20] and at the end of the day, I was
[29:22] thankful somebody loved me enough to
[29:24] tell me.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the kisses of an enemy are
[29:28] deceitful.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; I mean, you can get you can get a lot of
[29:33] people to be super nice to you, but that
[29:35] doesn't make them a friend. And that
[29:37] doesn't mean that they've got your best
[29:38] interest in mind.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Many times, the people who can be super
[29:42] syrupy, sweet, and over-the-top nice,
[29:45] they only have their own interest in
[29:47] mind.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; Usually, when they're overthe-top nice,
[29:51] usually they're doing that for
[29:53] themselves,
[29:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[29:55] I'd rather have somebody who's just
[29:57] blunt and straightforward and just tell
[29:59] me the truth than that super sweet gushy
[30:02] gush all over the place. Every time
[30:04] somebody does that to me, I'm like,
[30:05] something's wrong here.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; Nobody has ever liked me this much.
[30:14] Then you know something's up.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; But faithful, the open rebuke is better
[30:20] than secret love. Faithful or the wounds
[30:22] of a friend. A friend can wound another
[30:26] friend in love.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Remember, a friend loveth at all times.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; I've never had a friend wound me this
[30:38] way because they hated me.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; But only because they loved me.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; The message does God never change his
[30:50] mind. He says, "What if you've seen a
[30:51] man that you loved out in a boat
[30:52] floating right down toward the falls and
[30:54] know that boat was going to sink with
[30:56] him and you say, "Well, I love him, but
[30:58] he's got his own ways." No, I couldn't
[31:01] do that. That's not in me. I'd scream,
[31:04] run out and grab him, shake him, jerk
[31:06] him in, or anything else to get him out
[31:08] of there. You see, if you had a friend
[31:11] like that and he was going to destroy
[31:12] his life and he was going to go off the
[31:15] falls and and you went and did
[31:16] everything you could to just jerk him
[31:18] out to rescue him and pull him out, even
[31:20] if you saved his life and pulled him out
[31:22] and he's mad at you and he walks home
[31:23] angry with you, you're still satisfied
[31:25] that you loved him enough. Amen. Even to
[31:27] take the breaking of a friendship
[31:29] because I love him that much to save
[31:31] him.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; That's love that's for my friend. That's
[31:34] not love that's for me. Right.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; Too many times we act in love that
[31:39] benefits self, not love that benefits
[31:41] the one we claim to love.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if we love that person,
[31:46] even if saying something could cause a
[31:48] rift, even if saying something could
[31:50] cause them, amen, to misjudge me or pull
[31:52] away from me or be hurt towards me or
[31:54] clam up and not talk to me anymore, it's
[31:57] I love them enough and concerned enough
[31:59] to say something and risk that.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. that may hurt me rather than not
[32:05] say anything.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; That's a real friend. And if you've ever
[32:09] had a friend like that, treasure that
[32:11] friendship.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:15] Even in parenting, brother Rem says, "If
[32:18] Junior stands out there in the street
[32:19] and he's out there making mud a mud pile
[32:22] in the middle of the street where their
[32:23] cars are passing by, you say, "Junior,
[32:25] bless your little heart, honey. You
[32:27] shouldn't be sitting out there. When you
[32:29] get ready, come in." That's not love.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; You don't love your child and you take
[32:34] him out there and jerk him out of that
[32:36] street and get you a stick and teach him
[32:38] he shouldn't go out there again if you
[32:40] really love him.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; So remember our subject, a friend loveth
[32:45] at all times. Uh are we that kind of
[32:47] friend? Listen, the question is, I want
[32:49] A FRIEND, BUT WHAT kind of friend am I
[32:51] going to be? Because if I'm going to
[32:52] have friends, I must be friendly.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus was the kind of friend that
[32:59] if you were going into destruction and
[33:01] you were doing something that was going
[33:02] to destroy you, he would have said
[33:04] something.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; It's a good friend.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:11] He that rebuketh a man afterward shall
[33:14] find more favor than he that flatterth
[33:16] with the tongue.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. He that rebuketh a man afterward
[33:22] shall find more favor than he that
[33:24] flatterth with the tongue. Amen. I'm
[33:26] going to talk about flattery here for a
[33:27] little bit as I get into it. Amen. But I
[33:30] think flattery is sin.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; I think flattery is the worst thing that
[33:35] we could ever do to one another. And our
[33:37] culture is rank with it.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. One of one of the people I was
[33:44] talking to about this message was um
[33:46] brother Jason Demars and me and brother
[33:48] Jason Mars were having a good laugh
[33:49] because he grew up in Minnesota. I grew
[33:51] up in Ohio and we were really chuckling
[33:53] about how horrible Midwesterners are at
[33:56] being honest.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; We're terrible at it. We are the worst.
[34:04] And if anybody's ever honest with you,
[34:06] they're automatically labeled not nice.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; So when did lying to everybody be
[34:11] considered nice?
[34:13] &gt;&gt; At what point culturally did lying
[34:16] become nice? Because somebody could lie
[34:18] to you to your face, tell you the most
[34:20] wonderful thing that ever happened, that
[34:22] you must be an angel that come down from
[34:24] heaven, and you'll love that person. But
[34:25] if you have somebody who tells you,
[34:27] "Hey, listen. You need to move over to
[34:28] the side because you're standing in my
[34:30] way and I can't see." And you'll hate
[34:31] that person.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Why? BECAUSE OF OUR CULT, YOU BE LIKE,
[34:36] "HOW DARE YOU TALK TO ME LIKE THAT?" AND
[34:37] THE OTHER person just gush all over you
[34:39] and lie to you.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love it, friends. I love it when
[34:47] we have to face. My wife and I had to
[34:48] face this because we've had a lot of
[34:50] company stay in our home and we've had a
[34:52] lot of foreign brothers from overseas in
[34:54] our home. And when you have a lot of
[34:55] company in your home and a lot of
[34:57] different cultures and a different ways
[34:59] of living, Amen. you realize how bad off
[35:03] we are sometimes.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because sometimes the foreign
[35:08] brothers, especially with limited
[35:09] English and a different culture and they
[35:11] don't have the British mannerism kind of
[35:13] culture, they come up from somewhere
[35:14] completely different from Asia, Africa.
[35:16] Amen. They don't know any better than
[35:18] just tell you the truth.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; So you ask them, my wife asked a brother
[35:22] one time, she goes, she goes, "How do
[35:24] you like the food, brother?" Or I might
[35:26] have asked, she cooked, I asked, "How
[35:27] how do you like the supper?" Uh, it
[35:30] didn't agree with me. I didn't care for
[35:33] it. Oh my goodness. I was so ashamed. I
[35:36] asked the question, "My wife is trying
[35:38] to slip underneath the table. She's
[35:39] melting into a pile of shame."
[35:45] No Midwesterner would say that.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; If you if you were fed something you
[35:50] were allergic to, if you were breaking
[35:52] out hives all over your body, you would
[35:53] say, "It's wonderful. I love it. It's
[35:55] the best I ever had."
[36:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're guilty, friends. We're all
[36:04] guilty. But here we have a brother and
[36:06] then she served a meal one time to a
[36:08] different brother and he was eating and
[36:10] he throws up his hands. Sister, sister,
[36:12] sister, this is too cold.
[36:16] She was mortified.
[36:20] Mortified. She had to take his plate and
[36:22] go warm it up. And then she didn't know
[36:24] is it good to use the microwave or put
[36:26] it back in the oven? Will he be
[36:27] offended? And now she's tore up.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; But you know what? We ask them how they
[36:33] like it.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; We ask them if it's fine. We do it all
[36:37] the time. We go through our customary,
[36:38] how do you like it? We don't ever expect
[36:40] anybody tell us the truth. All we want
[36:41] to hear is it's wonderful.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; But it'd be good to have a friend once
[36:51] in a while would say, "Oh, sister, you
[36:53] made it a little bit spicy this time. I
[36:55] can't handle it.
[37:02] We should all move overseas for a little
[37:04] bit and come back and get perfected. Or
[37:07] if you want, I can arrange for you to
[37:08] host different people. If you want to if
[37:10] you want a little perfection, I I have
[37:12] some people in mind that I could help
[37:15] you. It would be a great help to you.
[37:20] We've had people that stayed the night
[37:22] and we tried to get the temperature
[37:23] right and where the house is upstairs,
[37:25] you got to move the vents between summer
[37:27] and winter. It's too cold, too hot. and
[37:29] we'll try to adjust it and I'll say,
[37:31] "Brother, how was it?" If there's an
[37:33] American staying with me, it has always
[37:36] been fine. It has never been anything
[37:37] but fine. It is always perfect.
[37:40] But if I have a brother from overseas,
[37:42] he'll say, "Well, I got a little chilly
[37:44] last night." Or, "It was a bit warm. I
[37:46] had to open the window."
[37:48] Which is great because now I can fix the
[37:51] problem because I can adjust the
[37:52] thermostat and move the vents.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; My question is, what would you say?
[38:05] We have a problem
[38:07] &gt;&gt; with being honest. Now, that's fine with
[38:10] casual associates. This a cultural
[38:12] thing. We're not going to go start
[38:13] blowing everything up in our society.
[38:16] Please don't leave here and get in a
[38:18] fight with everybody in the world.
[38:21] But when it comes to friendships, we
[38:23] should have a friendship that can be
[38:25] honest. We should get to a deeper level
[38:27] with one another. We could come to a
[38:29] place where when needful, when we love
[38:32] somebody and we need to share something,
[38:34] we have the freedom to be honest with a
[38:37] friend.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; And they should have the freedom to be
[38:39] honest with us. And we should be
[38:40] thankful that they were honest, not
[38:42] offended they were honest. Yeah.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; And if somebody comes to you with
[38:45] honesty, not with condemnation, not with
[38:48] insults, not with accusations, but an
[38:50] honest question and a concern, even if
[38:53] they're wrong, even if they've seeing
[38:55] the situation wrong and they haven't
[38:57] observed it right and they don't quite
[38:58] understand it all, we should still thank
[39:00] them that they cared enough to come and
[39:02] find out
[39:04] &gt;&gt; and then explain the situation. And then
[39:06] the friend is relieved from their burden
[39:08] for us and they say, "Oh, now I
[39:10] understand. It makes perfect sense to
[39:11] me. Thank you for taking the time to
[39:13] explain this to me.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; That's real friends,
[39:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[39:17] &gt;&gt; That's real friends. But we seem to have
[39:20] a problem with flattery.
[39:23] And flattery will will produce evil.
[39:26] It's it's actually not loving.
[39:29] Uh
[39:31] I said I wrote it down. This honesty is
[39:33] love when being honest is for the
[39:36] benefit of the other person.
[39:40] not personal gratification.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; I've I've known people who like to be
[39:50] honest.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Not for you.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; For them
[39:57] &gt;&gt; because they want to speak their mind
[39:58] and whatever's on their mind, they want
[40:00] to say it and they blah blah blah blah
[40:01] blah. But it's never be it's never out
[40:03] of love.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; And it's never from it was never for my
[40:06] benefit. It was just because they like
[40:07] to tell me off every chance that they
[40:09] had.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; That's not love.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Love is saying something even when you
[40:16] don't want to say it.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; And it's usually you don't want to say
[40:21] it cuz you don't want to hurt anybody,
[40:22] but you love somebody enough that you're
[40:25] going to get over yourself.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Because in order to be honest with
[40:29] somebody, we have to have a certain
[40:31] degree of self-security.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; We have to be secure in who we are.
[40:36] Amen. We have to love this person enough
[40:38] to get over ourselves enough to have an
[40:40] honest conversation with somebody. Amen.
[40:42] And that is real love. Honest. Honesty
[40:45] is love when being honest is for the
[40:48] benefit of the other person.
[40:50] Amen. So I asked the question, what is
[40:53] true love?
[40:56] What is kindness?
[40:59] What is it to be nice?
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Those are good questions.
[41:05] Amen. Let's keep going. And when I see
[41:08] that rank being broke there, Brother
[41:10] Ram's preaching out against the
[41:11] churches. And he says, "Letting let down
[41:14] the here on the morals of the people."
[41:16] And I just can't stand it. I got to fly
[41:18] into it. That's just all I can do. And I
[41:21] believe at the judgment bar, you will
[41:23] love me better if I tell you the truth
[41:25] now.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; But Ephesians 4, Amen. When he says it,
[41:32] he ascended on high and gave gifts unto
[41:34] men, he starts talking about, amen, till
[41:36] we all come into the unity of the faith
[41:37] and of the knowledge of the son of God,
[41:39] unto a perfect man, unto the measure of
[41:41] the stature, the fullness of Christ,
[41:42] that we henceforth be no more children
[41:44] tossed to and fro, and carried about
[41:46] with every wind of doctrine, by the
[41:47] slight of men, and cunning craftiness,
[41:49] whereby they lie and wait to deceive,
[41:51] but speaking the truth in love, may grow
[41:54] up unto him in all things which is the
[41:55] head, even Christ. Amen. If we're going
[41:58] to speak the truth, let's speak the
[42:00] truth in love. And if we can't speak it
[42:01] in love, let's not speak it.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; There are sometimes that not every
[42:06] thought that passes through your mind
[42:07] you should speak.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; Sometimes being silent is not being
[42:11] dishonest.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Because if you if you're not speaking
[42:15] the truth in love, keep it to yourself.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; We're not here just to tear everything
[42:21] down. We're here to edify, build up,
[42:24] encourage, provoke unto love and good
[42:27] works,
[42:28] &gt;&gt; to encourage one another.
[42:31] Brother Bham tells this story. You'll
[42:33] you'll hear it in the message in many
[42:35] different places. He tells a story about
[42:36] the Sunday school teacher who had
[42:38] refused the message and had resisted
[42:40] brother Brandham when he witnessed to
[42:41] her. She was part of a church and Sunday
[42:43] school teacher and she was dying. She
[42:45] was dying of a social disease and her
[42:47] pastor was there and he was smoking a
[42:49] cigarette and all the Sunday school Kim
[42:51] kids came to sing her into glory. But
[42:54] brother Benam in several places he's got
[42:55] different ways he words it but I pulled
[42:57] this out of conference. He said she was
[42:59] a church member. Yes sir. Her pastor
[43:01] standing there smoking a cigarette when
[43:03] she was dying. You know what she said to
[43:05] him? You deceiver of men. You told me I
[43:09] was right and you were wrong. She said,
[43:12] "I'm dying and I'm lost and you're the
[43:14] cause of it." Why? Because he wouldn't
[43:16] tell her the truth. He would pacify her
[43:18] and say, "You're fine. Everything's
[43:20] fine. You're a Christian. You're a
[43:21] Sunday school teacher. You're okay." But
[43:23] she wasn't okay. If she wasn't born
[43:25] again, she wasn't okay. If she wasn't
[43:27] living the word, she wasn't okay.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:34] The uh Proverbs says, "A man that
[43:36] flatterth his neighbor spreadth a net
[43:39] for his feet." Right?
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Read that carefully.
[43:43] A man that flatterth his neighbor
[43:45] spreadth a net for his feet. So then I
[43:48] ask you, what is love? To spread a net
[43:51] at somebody's feet. What is kind?
[43:54] To spread a net at somebody's feet.
[43:58] What does it mean to be nice?
[44:00] To spread a net at somebody's feet.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Grandparents can do this to
[44:06] grandkids. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're the sweetest little angel.
[44:10] You've never done anything wrong. You're
[44:11] so perfect.
[44:13] Come on.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Or parents or grandparents will cover
[44:18] for their sweet little perfect
[44:20] grandchild or sweet little perfect baby
[44:23] and they'll go and do the rottness of
[44:24] the rottenest teeth and you'll be like,
[44:26] "Oh, you didn't mean that. Oh, she
[44:27] didn't mean that. Oh, aren't you a sweet
[44:28] little thing?" NO, YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE
[44:30] ROTTEN. You did wrong.
[44:33] How is that not spreading a net at the
[44:35] feet of that child? They think
[44:36] everything they do is wonderful and
[44:38] they're a wonderful person and nobody's
[44:40] ever holding them accountable for their
[44:41] actions but always covering for it.
[44:43] That's not nice. That's not love.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; THAT'S A TRAP.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; THAT CHILD'S GOING TO FALL IN THE TRAP
[44:49] CUZ THEY'RE GOING TO THINK THAT I'M A
[44:51] GOOD PERSON and I'm good and everybody
[44:53] thinks I'm fine and they never they
[44:54] never realize the damage they're causing
[44:56] to others, the damage they're causing to
[44:58] themselves because nobody's ever held
[45:00] them accountable.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; It doesn't make or I mean we we say the
[45:04] silliest things. You get a little kid
[45:06] who's learning to play the violin first
[45:08] year out, first recital. Scratch,
[45:10] scratch, squeak, squeak, twinkle,
[45:11] twinkle, little star, and you say,
[45:13] "You're a maestro. You played that just
[45:16] like
[45:18] Why say that?"
[45:21] &gt;&gt; WHY NOT SAY, "I CAN TELL YOU'VE BEEN
[45:23] PRACTICING. You're getting better. And
[45:25] if you keep practicing, you'll be
[45:26] playing like the adults one day."
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Why do we think it's cute to lie to
[45:31] them?
[45:34] And that's not encouraging. That's not
[45:36] encouraging. That's not provoking.
[45:38] That's not encouraging to get better. I
[45:40] tell them, "You're fine. You could stop
[45:42] practicing now."
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; There's a difference between
[45:46] encouragement. We should be encouraging.
[45:48] We should be positive.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Not cutting them down. Not second stanza
[45:53] end. I I heard a squeak. No. Come on.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; But let's just be real with each other.
[45:58] Let's be real with our children. Let's
[46:00] be real with our spouses. Let's be real.
[46:02] Amen.
[46:04] Sometimes faithful are the wounds of a
[46:06] friend. Sometimes your best friend is
[46:07] your spouse. Don't raise your hand. But
[46:10] has anybody been wounded by the honesty
[46:11] of their spouse?
[46:13] Sit on your hands.
[46:16] But those are good wounds
[46:18] &gt;&gt; because somebody loves you enough to
[46:20] tell you, "Amen. When we were at so- and
[46:22] so's house and you said that you hurt
[46:23] that sister's feelings." Oh, I can't
[46:27] believe I did that. I'm so sorry. But
[46:28] what if she said, "Oh, my husband's
[46:30] perfect. He never does anything wrong.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's break a little Midwestern
[46:39] crust off of us.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Let's just love one another enough and
[46:46] love our children enough and love our
[46:48] spouses enough and love our brethren
[46:50] enough that we encourage them in the
[46:52] things that are right and discourage
[46:53] them in the things that are wrong. Amen.
[46:55] Even
[46:57] even Jesus Christ when you come to the
[46:59] uh book of revelations in the first
[47:01] three chapters when he goes to the
[47:02] church ages he always tells them what
[47:04] they did right and he tells them what
[47:05] they did wrong.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; That's love friends.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Tell encourage one another. Tell them
[47:11] what they did right. But if there's
[47:12] something that's hindering there's
[47:14] something that's hurting something
[47:15] that's going to cause a problem let's
[47:16] let's not be afraid to mention it.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:22] A man that flatterth his neighbor
[47:25] spreadth a net for his feet.
[47:28] Amen. We've seen people and and there's
[47:31] always different personality types and
[47:32] it's always funny and I'm not going to
[47:33] say too much because it gets into prying
[47:36] a little bit but you have
[47:37] characteristics in families,
[47:38] characteristics in in people and they
[47:40] almost cannot be honest. You ever been
[47:43] to somebody every time you give them a
[47:45] compliment they have to compliment you
[47:46] back?
[47:49] &gt;&gt; So they just make something up.
[47:51] because they feel the pressure. You just
[47:53] said something nice to them. They have
[47:54] to say something nice to you. And so
[47:56] they just they just makes that I like
[47:58] your hairbo
[48:01] whether they liked it or not. THEY FELT
[48:03] THE PRESSURE AND they just blah.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Instead of just saying thank you, I
[48:08] appreciate you saying that.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; It gets into a cultural thing.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; I just want to learn to be honest. I
[48:17] want to be honest and loving. not just
[48:18] honest, but loving and honest
[48:21] &gt;&gt; and true. And I want to be a true
[48:23] friend. And I want to have true friends.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; I want to encourage one another and
[48:27] stand by each other in the worst of
[48:29] worst times and love each other no
[48:31] matter what. Be honest and loving. Amen.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Now, brother said, "This old-fashioned
[48:41] sassifrass preaching may be rough as it
[48:43] can be, but brother, that's all I know.
[48:45] That's what saved me, and that's all I
[48:47] know." Now, I don't want to offend you,
[48:49] but I sure would rather offend you a
[48:51] little now. That gets you right with God
[48:53] and know I have to stand there that day
[48:55] and you point your finger in my face and
[48:57] say, "Why didn't you tell me the truth?"
[48:59] See, I'd rather have it fixed up now.
[49:01] Wouldn't you all?
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Remember when uh Brother Isaiah was
[49:06] preaching on Sunday and he says, "You
[49:07] tell somebody the truth and they get mad
[49:09] at you." He goes, "I would rather make
[49:10] you mad."
[49:12] &gt;&gt; When I was sitting in my SEAT GOING,
[49:13] "AMEN." RIGHT. RIGHT.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's what I've been meditating on.
[49:19] Not that we want to make each other mad,
[49:20] but I would I would rather rather I
[49:23] rather than being complicit to watching
[49:24] a train wreck. Amen. I'd rather say
[49:27] something
[49:28] &gt;&gt; rather than sitting back and watch a
[49:30] family go off the rails and watch
[49:32] somebody go into utter destruction or a
[49:34] man GO OVER THE FALLS AND JUST keep my
[49:36] mouth shut because I can only say nice
[49:37] things and I can only compliment. I can
[49:39] only praise. But I can never question. I
[49:41] can never ask if everything's all right.
[49:43] I can never share a concern.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; God, help us not to be complicit. Help
[49:48] us not to be Amen. sitting there
[49:50] watching, doing nothing, but let's be
[49:52] good friends
[49:54] &gt;&gt; and love one another with a real
[49:57] sacrificial love. A love that causes us
[50:01] to get out of our comfort zone. A love
[50:02] that causes causes us to risk
[50:06] ourselves for the benefit of somebody
[50:08] else. Risk our reputation. risk somebody
[50:11] getting upset at us. Risk being able to
[50:14] have an uncomfortable conversation.
[50:16] Amen. Risk it for the love and benefit
[50:18] of another human being
[50:21] &gt;&gt; or just stay safely behind our own safe
[50:23] shelter and have eyes to see but never a
[50:26] mouth to speak.
[50:28] So God help us. Help us to be true.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said remember love is
[50:32] corrective always. Genuine love is
[50:35] corrective. So you must be able to stand
[50:37] the correction.
[50:40] Brother said, "I've all my life I've
[50:42] cherished friends. There's nothing I
[50:45] love like people, and I wanted people to
[50:48] love me." I put this in here because
[50:49] Brother Brennan was a rejected little
[50:51] boy. All of his life, he wanted friends,
[50:53] and he loved people, and he felt the
[50:55] rejection all the time. And he said this
[50:57] also, "I was misunderstood so much to
[51:00] when I'd be talking on the street to
[51:02] someone and somebody else would come
[51:03] up." Well, they'd walk away and leave me
[51:06] stand. and I love people, but no one had
[51:09] nothing to do with me. I was what they
[51:11] called the black sheep. Here's a man
[51:13] with the rejection complex. And here's a
[51:15] man who just wants people to love him,
[51:17] and he loves people. Amen. But this is
[51:19] man's been called to be a prophet of the
[51:21] age. And he's been a one who's got to
[51:23] cry out against SIN AND CALL OUT to the
[51:25] man going over the falls again and again
[51:28] and again. And what does he get in
[51:29] return? Rejection. Rejection. Rejection.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; But I didn't reject him. I'm thankful he
[51:36] called out against sin. I'm thankful he
[51:38] CALLED OUT AGAINST MY PROBLEM, my issue,
[51:40] my church, MY FORM OF BELIEF. I THANK
[51:42] GOD THAT A MAN WHO DIDN'T WANT to did. A
[51:46] MAN WHO DIDN'T LIKE IT did it anyways. A
[51:48] MAN WHO WASN'T HOSTILE. HE WASN'T
[51:50] CRITICAL. HE WASN'T CUTTING anybody
[51:52] down, but he was under a commission of
[51:54] GOD AND HE LOVED human beings enough to
[51:56] tell the truth OUT OF THE BIBLE. AND I
[51:58] THANK GOD THAT HE DID.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; WHY SHOULD HE BE THE ONLY ONE IN AN AGE
[52:03] THAT done it? WHY NOT WE? AMEN. FOLLOW
[52:06] SUITS. AMEN.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God. To me, that's real love.
[52:10] BECAUSE THAT MAN DID NOT WANT the
[52:12] rejection that followed being honest.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; HE WOULD GO STAND. HE WOULD BE PREACHING
[52:18] the truth. Amen. To ministers who were
[52:20] getting UP OUT OF THE BACK AND WALKING
[52:22] OUT AND DROVES OF them were walking out.
[52:25] WHILE HE WAS PREACHING, I WAS NOT
[52:26] disobedient to the heavenly vision. AND
[52:28] HE HAD TO STAND there and finish his
[52:30] sermon. A MAN WHO WAS REJECTED AS a boy
[52:33] who just wanted PEOPLE TO LOVE HIM HAD
[52:35] TO STAND THERE AND deliver what God
[52:36] placed ON HIS HEART WHILE PEOPLE WERE
[52:38] SHAKING their heads and walking out.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; And I thank God he did.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; To me, he's a friend.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus says, "As many as I love,
[52:52] I rebuke and chasen."
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Be zealous, therefore, and repent.
[52:58] as many as I love.
[53:01] He didn't rebuke and chasen all the ones
[53:04] he didn't love, but the ones he loved.
[53:08] Brother V says, "Genuine love is
[53:10] corrective and brings you back to the
[53:12] word of God."
[53:15] Pay attention to that. Love is
[53:17] corrective and brings us back to the
[53:19] word of God. That's the whole point.
[53:22] Amen. There's a couple more out of
[53:24] Proverbs that I want to read. A lying
[53:26] tongue hateth those that are afflicted
[53:28] by it, and a flattering mouth workketh
[53:31] ruin.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; I'm glad it's on the screen.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Chad ain't saying it. The
[53:42] Bible's telling us this.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Our culture is not always right.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Right.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Not everything in it wrong.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; It's nice to be nice. Be cordial,
[53:54] especially with people you don't know.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; The last thing I want is for us to leave
[53:59] here and start ripping into each other
[54:01] in the foyer. I never liked that shirt
[54:03] on you. I just want to tell you. And I
[54:06] never thought you should have bought
[54:07] that car. It's too exp. Listen friends,
[54:08] let's not do that.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Let our honesty be motivated in love for
[54:13] the benefit of another.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Love, not just to be honest. That's
[54:19] that's not love. Amen.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; But love in the way of concern. Love
[54:24] because I love you more than I love how
[54:27] uncomfortable I feel right. More than
[54:29] staying secure.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; I love you enough.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; They speak vanity everyone with his
[54:37] neighbor. With flattering lips and with
[54:39] a double heart do they speak. I want to
[54:43] ask you this question. Have you ever
[54:46] complimented somebody and didn't really
[54:48] mean it?
[54:51] Don't raise your hand
[54:54] &gt;&gt; just because you felt the pressure to
[54:57] say something nice.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Have you ever in your life looked at a
[55:04] newborn baby and say that is the most
[55:06] beautiful little baby but in your mind
[55:08] thought that is the most wrinkled ugly
[55:10] little thing I've ever seen.
[55:14] Don't raise your hand.
[55:18] Have you ever seen somebody's little
[55:20] ugly mut that they think the world of?
[55:22] They think it's the most beautiful dog
[55:24] in the world. And for you, it's got one
[55:26] ear bigger than the other. It's a
[55:27] patchwork quilt of colors and you think
[55:29] it's the ugliest dog in the world. But
[55:31] you know they think it's the greatest
[55:32] thing ever. So instead of just keeping
[55:34] your mouth shut, you know what they
[55:36] think. So you start spilling and gushing
[55:39] a bunch of stuff you don't mean.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Isn't that a beautiful little dog? Oh,
[55:45] it's so precious. Oh, you're so lucky to
[55:47] have it. and your mind thinking, "If I
[55:48] had it, I'd get rid of it so fast."
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Why do we do that? We do that for
[55:56] ourselves
[55:58] &gt;&gt; cuz we want to be liked and we don't
[56:00] want to feel uncomfortable.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; It's not honest. It's not true. It's not
[56:05] right. And it sets a snare at somebody
[56:07] else's feet. And then the worst is when
[56:09] you hear him repeat it to somebody else.
[56:11] Oh, brother Chad said he loves my dog
[56:13] and thinks he's so beautiful. And all a
[56:15] suen you're going, "God, please forgive
[56:16] me.
[56:18] I'm so sorry I said that."
[56:22] But under the pressure of the moment, we
[56:24] just blah blah blah blah blah.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; That was a funny story.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; But sometimes it's not funny.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; With flattering lips and with a double
[56:37] heart do they speak.
[56:40] Let's just say what we mean and mean
[56:42] what we say.
[56:44] Let's just be honest with each other.
[56:46] Listen, if somebody serves you a meal
[56:48] and it was disgusting,
[56:50] don't say it was disgusting.
[56:52] Say, "I appreciate your effort.
[56:58] I'm so glad you went through all the
[56:59] trouble to fix this for me."
[57:05] Amen. But don't tell them it was the
[57:07] best thing you ever had because the
[57:09] problem is they're going to serve that
[57:10] to the next guest and you don't love the
[57:12] next one who's coming over.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; You just loved yourself.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; It's funny, but when we talk about
[57:19] little things, it becomes consequential.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; We start to make people believe we're
[57:24] good at things we're not good at.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; We start to set people up for failure.
[57:28] We start to encourage them in things
[57:30] they shouldn't be encouraged in and not
[57:31] to discourage them in things they should
[57:32] be discouraged in. And we're not really
[57:34] honest. And we set people up for
[57:36] heartbreak. We set people up for
[57:38] destruction.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Instead of just either being quiet or
[57:42] finding a nice way to be honest, but
[57:44] don't lie.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; And let's be honest with each other and
[57:48] be credible.
[57:50] Amen.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; This is fun to preach.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; This is not my typical sermon, but I've
[57:55] been wanting to preach this for months.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Because I want to be a good friend
[58:00] &gt;&gt; and I want to have good friends.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; John 15, this is my commandment that you
[58:09] love one another as I have loved you.
[58:13] I'm going to I want to highlight
[58:15] something here
[58:18] as I have loved you.
[58:21] That means we should love one another in
[58:23] the same way he loved us.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Love one another as I have loved you. In
[58:28] the same way. And how did he love Peter?
[58:31] When Peter was coming and and resisting
[58:33] the word of God and trying to get him to
[58:35] bypass Calvary,
[58:38] &gt;&gt; he rebuked the spirit that was in Peter,
[58:39] he didn't mince words.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Peter was following the
[58:44] wrong wrong line of thinking. He was
[58:46] being persuaded by an evil spirit. He
[58:48] wasn't in line with God's word. And
[58:50] Jesus never stood by and let it go on.
[58:52] He told the truth.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Love one another as I have loved you.
[58:59] Greater love hath no man than this, that
[59:02] a man lay down his life,
[59:04] lay down his life for his friends.
[59:08] Amen.
[59:10] That this is a true statement. We saw
[59:12] that Jesus actually laid down his life
[59:14] for his friends. And we don't have the
[59:16] opportunity all the time to give
[59:17] ourselves at Calvary and to take a
[59:19] bullet for one another or things like
[59:21] that. But listen, can we sacrifice our
[59:24] our own comforts,
[59:26] &gt;&gt; our own comfort zone, our own self-p
[59:28] protection? Can we lay down our life in
[59:31] a minor way for each other?
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "You are my friends if you
[59:38] do whatsoever I command you."
[59:39] Henceforth, I call you not servants, for
[59:41] the servant knoweth not what his lord
[59:43] doeth, but I have called you friends,
[59:45] for all things that I have heard of my
[59:47] father, I have made known unto you."
[59:50] Jesus had friends.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. He asked us to love one another as
[59:55] he loved his friends.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; And said, "God, help me to be that kind
[59:59] of friend."
[1:00:01] Amen. How did he love Peter? He loved
[1:00:04] Peter enough, Amen, that he chose Peter
[1:00:06] and he stayed friends with Peter and he
[1:00:08] would rebuke Peter. But did he reject
[1:00:11] Peter?
[1:00:12] What happened when Peter got the wrong
[1:00:14] idea about Calvary, about being
[1:00:16] persecuted? Jesus never rejected him.
[1:00:18] Jesus never said, "Get away from me.
[1:00:20] You're off the word. I'm never going to
[1:00:22] talk to you again." He stayed friends
[1:00:23] with Peter. What happened when all
[1:00:26] forsook him and Peter promised, "I'll
[1:00:28] never leave you. I'm willing to go to
[1:00:29] prison. I'm willing to give my life for
[1:00:31] you." Amen. And then Peter ran away.
[1:00:34] Amen. From the Garden of Gethsemane,
[1:00:35] abandoned Jesus Christ. Abandon his
[1:00:37] friend and his time of need. And then
[1:00:40] began to swear and curse and deny that
[1:00:43] he ever knowed the man.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; How did Jesus treat him then? Amen.
[1:00:48] Listen, Jesus never said, "Oh, that's
[1:00:51] okay, Peter." But he come to Peter and
[1:00:53] reconciled with Peter. He said, "Peter,
[1:00:55] do you love me?"
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; He gave Peter a chance to make it right.
[1:01:00] He reconciled because he loved Peter. He
[1:01:02] didn't reject him. Amen. He was a true
[1:01:04] friend.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. He reconciled him. He stayed with
[1:01:10] him even in a rebuke. He didn't He
[1:01:13] didn't end the friendship
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; just because there was a rebuke.
[1:01:18] Brother Brandham makes this statement.
[1:01:20] He says, "Now in the reading of the
[1:01:23] gospel, I was telling Pastor Boz just a
[1:01:25] few moments ago, and I want to express
[1:01:28] again outwardly my gratitude and
[1:01:30] appreciations to Pastor Boz. You know,
[1:01:32] we are we have our ups and downs.
[1:01:36] There's sometimes that we have our ins
[1:01:37] and outs as we call it. But Brother
[1:01:39] Joseph has proven to be my friend in all
[1:01:42] kinds of weather." And I love that all
[1:01:45] weather friend. Don't you? Whether you
[1:01:48] are right or wrong. Woo!
[1:01:52] I love that all-weather friend. Whether
[1:01:55] you're right or wrong,
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; will you be my friend even when I'm
[1:02:02] wrong?
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Will you be friend enough to tell me you
[1:02:06] think I'm wrong and still be my friend?
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Can I be your friend? Right or wrong, in
[1:02:14] or out, up or down, can I remain a
[1:02:17] friend?
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; If you can turn with me to the book of
[1:02:20] Job, I want to read just out of Job here
[1:02:24] for just a minute. Job chapter 2.
[1:02:40] Job chapter 2 verse 11.
[1:02:46] Now when Job's three friends heard of
[1:02:48] all this evil that was come upon him,
[1:02:50] they came everyone from his own place.
[1:02:52] Elephas the Tim Timmonite and Bildad the
[1:02:56] Shuhite and Zafar the Naamathite. For
[1:02:59] they had made an appointment together to
[1:03:01] come to mourn with him and to comfort
[1:03:03] him. That was nice.
[1:03:06] some bad things that happened to him and
[1:03:08] he got in a bad way and three of his
[1:03:10] friends came to mourn with him and to
[1:03:12] comfort with him to comfort him. Is that
[1:03:14] great?
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; But we know later
[1:03:17] Job would say, "Miserable comforters are
[1:03:19] ye."
[1:03:22] Go to chapter 32 with me.
[1:03:29] You know what they say with friends like
[1:03:30] these who need enemies? You know,
[1:03:34] Job 32:3,
[1:03:38] it says, "Also against his three friends
[1:03:40] was he was he wrath was his wrath
[1:03:43] kindled because they had found no answer
[1:03:46] and yet had condemned Job."
[1:03:49] Why was God angry? Why was his wrath
[1:03:51] kindled against the three friends?
[1:03:53] Because they didn't know what was
[1:03:55] happening to Job or why. They didn't
[1:03:57] understand the trial. Job himself didn't
[1:03:59] understand the trial. But instead of
[1:04:01] just bearing through the trial with Job,
[1:04:04] they had to somehow come up with an
[1:04:05] answer. And they made it Job as a secret
[1:04:08] sinner. Somehow you're wrong, Job. And
[1:04:10] if you'll just admit you're wrong and
[1:04:11] stop being so proud. If you'll just do
[1:04:13] all that, it'll all work out. Hey,
[1:04:15] listen. And they were dead wrong. There
[1:04:17] wasn't anything wrong with Job. Amen.
[1:04:19] God had put him in a trial.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; And these friends, they came to comfort
[1:04:25] and to mourn with and to comfort Job.
[1:04:28] Amen. And that's fine. They should have
[1:04:30] just done that. They just stuck with him
[1:04:31] through the whole process and been a
[1:04:33] friend to him instead of start saying,
[1:04:35] "Well, I think maybe this and I think
[1:04:37] maybe that." Listen, they were just
[1:04:39] guessing. They didn't know. They had no
[1:04:41] knowledge. They were just guessing.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; That's why TO BE A TRUE FRIEND, LISTEN,
[1:04:46] if your friend gets in trouble and
[1:04:48] something goes wrong and something in
[1:04:50] their family goes wrong, don't go up
[1:04:51] there and start trying to help them
[1:04:53] figure out what it was. Well, maybe
[1:04:54] because this and remember that and you
[1:04:56] didn't go to communion and this. Listen,
[1:04:58] if you don't know why, then don't act
[1:05:00] like you know why.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Because all you do is start heaping
[1:05:04] condemnation and guilt upon a friend.
[1:05:06] And it may have nothing to do with what
[1:05:07] the friend's done. Amen. Maybe God's
[1:05:09] just testing you to see if you're a
[1:05:11] friend
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; OR TESTING YOUR FRIEND TO see if he'll
[1:05:15] stay TRUE TO THE WORD. DON'T START
[1:05:17] GUESSING. Don't start assuming. When I
[1:05:20] say we have to be honest WITH ONE
[1:05:21] ANOTHER, HONEST with one another is
[1:05:23] something that you know is a problem or
[1:05:25] you've seen or you know for sure or you
[1:05:27] ASK A QUESTION. YOU'RE NOT BEING HONEST
[1:05:29] IS NOT THROWING ACCUSATIONS.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. RIGHT.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; MAKING STUFF UP, PLAYING THE PART OF GOD
[1:05:37] AND SAYING, "I THINK BECAUSE YOU did
[1:05:39] this now this and this and this is
[1:05:41] happening." Listen, that's playing God.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Don't do that to a friend. That
[1:05:46] discourages a friend. Don't ever do
[1:05:48] that. You just stay with them and let
[1:05:50] God sort it out.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; If you ever have to go to a friend and
[1:05:54] be honest with them, it should be
[1:05:55] something that you know.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; You saw it. You heard it. You know it.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Or if you go with a question, the
[1:06:02] question's not condemnation.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; A question is I I didn't understand
[1:06:06] this. Can you explain this to me?
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; That's a friend. Yeah.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; To stick with one another all the way
[1:06:14] through. Good or bad,
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; up or down,
[1:06:19] right or wrong,
[1:06:22] stick with one another.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Why is it so hard when our friend makes
[1:06:27] a mistake to stay with them? Jesus did,
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; We can, too. Yes, sir.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Which one of us has come to sinless
[1:06:38] perfection yet?
[1:06:42] That's right.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; We're all going to make mistakes.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Some of them will be visible and some of
[1:06:47] them will be private. Some others will
[1:06:49] know, some won't know. But why can't we
[1:06:51] stay a friend?
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; I mean, and call a spade a spade. If
[1:06:57] there's wrong, wrong. Don't smooth it
[1:06:59] over.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Don't say, "Oh, no, no, you're a perfect
[1:07:01] angel." No, what you did was pretty bad,
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to stay with you, brother.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Get back up. Let's keep going. Grace is
[1:07:11] still sufficient for you.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Let's make it right. Let's let's correct
[1:07:15] the error and let's keep moving forward.
[1:07:17] Let's be a real friend.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Second Timothy, the Apostle Paul says,
[1:07:22] "At my first answer, no man stood with
[1:07:24] me, but all men forsook me. I pray God
[1:07:28] that it may not be laid to their charge.
[1:07:31] Notwithstanding, the Lord stood with me
[1:07:33] and strengthened me that by me the
[1:07:35] preaching might be fully known and that
[1:07:37] all the Gentiles might hear and I was
[1:07:39] delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
[1:07:42] Paul knows what it was like to be
[1:07:44] forsaken by friends. He said, Deeus, he
[1:07:47] wrote to Timothy, Deeus has forsaken me,
[1:07:49] having loved this present world. And
[1:07:52] brother Brennham said, why did Deeus
[1:07:54] leave? because it looked like Paul was
[1:07:55] all washed up and that his ministry was
[1:07:57] over and his power was all gone and
[1:07:59] Deeus left him.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; That is not a real friend.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Why was Deeus friends with Paul? For
[1:08:07] Deus
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; because when it started to cause Deus
[1:08:12] grief to be Paul's friend,
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; he left.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; What about brother Brandham? When he had
[1:08:19] the meetings all over the place in the
[1:08:21] late 40s, early 50s, it was it was good
[1:08:24] to be his friend.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; But when everybody started pulling away
[1:08:27] from him and accusing him of being a
[1:08:29] false prophet and teaching wrong and
[1:08:30] making himself something, his friends
[1:08:32] started disappearing.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Same thing happened to Paul. His friends
[1:08:37] started vanishing when he said, "They're
[1:08:39] offended at my change because he was
[1:08:41] arrested and put in bondage." Amen. They
[1:08:43] got offended and they started assuming
[1:08:45] maybe something was wrong. His ministry
[1:08:47] washed up. God's not dealing with him
[1:08:49] like he used to. And God WAS DEALING
[1:08:50] WITH HIM LIKE HE ALWAYS HAD. HE WAS
[1:08:53] RIGHT IN THE WILL OF GOD, RIGHT WHERE
[1:08:55] God wanted him. He was going to write
[1:08:56] the prison epistles. He was going to
[1:08:58] write our New Testament in those chains.
[1:09:00] But because his friends didn't
[1:09:02] understand the will of God, they assumed
[1:09:04] something was wrong. HE'S LOST HIS
[1:09:05] POWER. HE'S LOST HIS MINISTRY. HE'S ALL
[1:09:07] WASHED UP. And they left him, proving
[1:09:09] they were only friends with Paul for
[1:09:11] their benefit.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; That's not a real friend. Amen.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; If you're ever a real friend, there's
[1:09:18] times that being a friend to a real
[1:09:20] friend is going to cost you
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; and make you look bad and maybe make you
[1:09:24] look compromised and maybe people
[1:09:26] question you.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Be that kind of friend.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Don't save yourself. Save your friend.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Because why? No greater love hath any
[1:09:40] man than he laid down his life.
[1:09:44] Timothy saw and heard everything Deus
[1:09:46] saw and heard. Timothy experienced
[1:09:48] everything all the other ones. But
[1:09:50] Timothy stayed with Paul.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; There was a lot of brethren who stayed
[1:09:55] with brother Benham. And I'm thankful
[1:09:56] that they did.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Let's stay with each other.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Love one another.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:09] Hebrews 13 says, "Let your conversation
[1:10:11] be without covetousness, and be content
[1:10:14] with such things as you have. For you
[1:10:16] have said, for he hath said, I will
[1:10:18] never leave thee, nor forsake thee, so
[1:10:21] that we may boldly say, the Lord is my
[1:10:23] helper, and I will not fear what man
[1:10:25] shall do unto me."
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "He'll never leave you nor
[1:10:30] forsake you."
[1:10:32] Right.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Have you always been a good friend to
[1:10:36] him?
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Did you ever make him look bad?
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Was he still your friend when you were
[1:10:45] wrong
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; and done wrong?
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Was high and low and in and out and up
[1:10:54] and down.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Love one another as I have loved
[1:11:01] you.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're supposed to be Christ's
[1:11:05] representative on the earth. We're
[1:11:07] supposed to represent him and to love
[1:11:10] one another. Be a friend the way he's
[1:11:12] been a friend. And he's promised to
[1:11:15] never leave us nor forsake us. I believe
[1:11:19] he's never forsaken me.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; I believe he's always been there for me.
[1:11:23] Every time I've repented, he's taken me
[1:11:25] back. He's called me to repentance. He's
[1:11:27] rebuked me. He's caused others to come
[1:11:29] and be honest with me. He's called
[1:11:30] preacher to come to the pull pit. And
[1:11:32] he's exposed me.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; And I thanked him for it.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; And I loved him for it.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; He's never forsaken me. But oh,
[1:11:42] I've been a hard friend to be a friend
[1:11:44] to sometimes.
[1:11:48] Amen. I I I've done things that would
[1:11:52] embarrass him, things that were wrong,
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; but he didn't forsake me.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; He didn't cast me away, just like he
[1:11:59] didn't Peter.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; And I don't want to cast anyone else
[1:12:04] away.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; I want to be a true friend.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Why? Because a friend loveth when?
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; At all times.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Not just your good times.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Right. A friend loveth in your bad
[1:12:20] times.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; A friend loveth at all times.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; That's a friend.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Benham took this friendship into
[1:12:30] marriage in the message the invasion of
[1:12:32] the United States in 1954. He says, "And
[1:12:35] when a man starts to get married, the
[1:12:37] type of girl woman that it's more than
[1:12:39] just look at a beauty. You've got to get
[1:12:41] somebody both soul and body joined
[1:12:44] together. somebody that's really going
[1:12:46] to be your friend and pal that'll stick
[1:12:49] with you through thick and thin. There's
[1:12:53] ever a friendship that'll be tested,
[1:12:55] it's the friendship that moves the
[1:12:56] marriage.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; And you've got to stick with each other
[1:13:00] through thick and thin.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Good times and bad times. There's been
[1:13:05] times I know
[1:13:08] that I've not been a good friend to my
[1:13:10] wife.
[1:13:12] There's been times that I've embarrassed
[1:13:14] her.
[1:13:17] I mean, that shouldn't be shocking. You
[1:13:19] guys know me well enough now. That
[1:13:21] should be like, "Yeah, we know that."
[1:13:24] But she never left me. She stayed right
[1:13:27] there. There have been times I would
[1:13:29] make an embarrassing comment. She would
[1:13:30] flush. She would turn red.
[1:13:33] But she's not bailing on the friendship
[1:13:35] just because
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; I hit a low mark. I missed the mark. I
[1:13:39] made a mistake. She stayed with me. And
[1:13:43] there's been a few times I've had to
[1:13:44] stay with her, but it's more her with me
[1:13:46] than me with her. But
[1:13:49] but you got to have somebody to stick
[1:13:51] with you. And this gets tested in
[1:13:52] marriage. But it holds
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; because of love.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; And if it holds in marriage, it can hold
[1:13:58] in every other friendship. It can hold
[1:14:00] in the body. It can hold a brother to a
[1:14:02] sister, sister to a sister, brother to a
[1:14:04] brother.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; It can hold.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:10] Jesus says this, "Teaching them to
[1:14:13] observe all things whatsoever I've
[1:14:15] commanded you. And lo, I am with you
[1:14:17] always, even to the end of the world."
[1:14:21] That's the kind of friend he is.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of friend I want to be.
[1:14:26] A friend loveth at all times.
[1:14:31] A friend will love you more than they
[1:14:36] love their own comfort.
[1:14:38] A friend will love
[1:14:40] will do for you what is best for you.
[1:14:43] Even if it's a difficult conversation,
[1:14:46] that's a real friend. So, how many wants
[1:14:48] a friend?
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Then we're going to have to be a friend.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; How many wants a friend like the one
[1:14:54] I've described?
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Then you've got to be a friend like the
[1:14:58] one I've described. It's amazing how the
[1:15:00] Bible instructs us in every area of our
[1:15:03] life. If we'll just come the Bible way
[1:15:05] and not our cultural way and not our
[1:15:07] family traditional way and not our
[1:15:10] church way, but we'll just come to the
[1:15:11] Bible way.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Then we'll find real victory, real
[1:15:15] victory in love divine.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Because remember, brotherly love is the
[1:15:20] last stage before perfect love.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; And God is bringing us into perfect love
[1:15:26] through brotherly love. And guess where
[1:15:28] our tests are going to be? Yeah,
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; right at the capstone, friends.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; This is the capstone age.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's all stand.
[1:15:39] Musicians, if you'll come and Blake, if
[1:15:40] you'll come. So glad I could share that
[1:15:42] with you. Amen.
[1:15:48] Listen, don't flatter me.
[1:15:51] If you didn't like the message, don't
[1:15:53] say nothing.
[1:15:58] Don't say that was really good, brother
[1:16:00] Ted. Just say I appreciate your effort.
[1:16:05] I could tell you tried hard.
[1:16:11] I love you all.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; I want to be a good friend to you.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; And I want you to be my friend. We're
[1:16:17] going to need each other. Hey, listen.
[1:16:18] Don't think that the devil's not going
[1:16:20] to pull some stunts. Try some tricks.
[1:16:23] Bring division. try to bring separation
[1:16:25] because by this all men shall know
[1:16:27] you're my disciples when you have love
[1:16:29] one for the another. Where do you think
[1:16:31] the trial is going to be? Amen. If if
[1:16:33] this is where God is manifesting himself
[1:16:35] in a bride body, Amen. where you have to
[1:16:37] have every finger, toe, amen, nose, ear,
[1:16:41] eyebrow connected to each other and
[1:16:43] plugged in and and and providing for one
[1:16:45] another and edification to one another.
[1:16:47] Where do you think the test is going to
[1:16:48] be?
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; And friendship.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. I for one want to pass the test
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; and I want to love you more than I love
[1:16:58] myself
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; because the kind of friend Jesus Christ
[1:17:01] was.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads and pray. Dear Lord
[1:17:05] Jesus, I thank you that you've never
[1:17:09] left me nor forsaken me. And you've kept
[1:17:12] your promise that you'll be with us
[1:17:14] always, even to the end of the world.
[1:17:18] And God, we we believe that. We know
[1:17:20] it's true, Lord Jesus, because you've
[1:17:22] been a true friend to us. You've stuck
[1:17:24] by us. You've been honest with us.
[1:17:27] You've corrected us when we were wrong.
[1:17:29] You encouraged us when we were right.
[1:17:32] Lord, you poured the bomb of Gilead.
[1:17:34] When we need healing, you spoke words of
[1:17:36] love and comfort. When we were
[1:17:38] discouraged,
[1:17:40] when we were thinking wrong, you gave us
[1:17:42] words that corrected our thinking. You
[1:17:44] lined us back up. You have done
[1:17:47] everything to be a good friend.
[1:17:50] And Lord, we want to be a good friend to
[1:17:51] one another. God, would you come help us
[1:17:54] break out of the mold that society has
[1:17:56] tried to put us in that? Let our culture
[1:17:59] and family traditions and even in our
[1:18:02] own genetic makeup. Would you help us
[1:18:05] Lord to go beyond the limitations but
[1:18:07] come to your word and to love one
[1:18:10] another to love each other with a
[1:18:12] fervent love an unfeigned and
[1:18:14] unpretending real genuine love to where
[1:18:19] we can bear with one another all the way
[1:18:21] to the end where we can come alongside a
[1:18:25] brother to comfort and to mourn with
[1:18:27] them not even understanding why they're
[1:18:29] suffering and not try to figure it out
[1:18:30] like Job's friends but just stick with
[1:18:32] them. Help us to be that kind of friend.
[1:18:36] And Lord, when we find that a friend is
[1:18:39] offended or done wrong like Peter did to
[1:18:41] you, let us be the kind of friend you
[1:18:43] were to Peter, Lord, where you just
[1:18:45] reconcile and take him back and trust
[1:18:47] him and love him.
[1:18:49] Be a real friend.
[1:18:51] God, I pray you'd help us, that you
[1:18:53] would correct us, that you would make us
[1:18:56] be your reflection on this earth. And if
[1:18:58] there's anything, Lord, whether it's a
[1:19:00] family tradition, a personality trait, a
[1:19:02] cultural issue, would you break it off
[1:19:05] of us and let your word live inside of
[1:19:06] us and let us manifest just your word.
[1:19:10] We love you. We ask that you would bless
[1:19:12] us, that you would help us, you help us
[1:19:14] to be an encouragement and a blessing
[1:19:16] and a source of comfort and love to one
[1:19:18] another. May we be like those sheep in
[1:19:20] the heat of the day, leaning on one
[1:19:22] another, yielding ourselves to each
[1:19:24] other for their benefit, shielding,
[1:19:26] protecting, shading, supporting each
[1:19:29] other. We love you. Help us to be the
[1:19:33] friend that loveth at all times. We ask
[1:19:35] that you'd help us with this in Jesus
[1:19:37] Christ's name. Amen.
[1:19:40] Amen.
[1:19:42] I have found a friend in Jesus. He's
[1:19:46] everything to me. He's the fairest of
[1:19:50] 10,000 to my soul.
[1:19:54] The lily of the valley. In him alone I
[1:19:58] see. All I need to cleanse and make me
[1:20:02] fully whole.
[1:20:05] In sorrow he's my comfort. In trouble
[1:20:08] he's my stay. He tells me every care on
[1:20:12] him to roll. Hallelujah. He's the lily
[1:20:16] of the valley, the bright and morning
[1:20:20] star. He's the fairest of 10,000 to my
[1:20:24] soul.
[1:20:26] He all my grief has taken and all my
[1:20:30] sorrows bone. In temptation, he's my
[1:20:33] strong and mighty tower.
[1:20:36] I have all for him forsaken and all my
[1:20:40] idols torn from my heart. And now he
[1:20:43] keeps me by his power.
[1:20:47] And though all the world forsake me and
[1:20:50] Satan tempts me sore, through Jesus I
[1:20:54] shall safely reach the goal. Hallelujah.
[1:20:57] He's the lily of the valley, the bright
[1:21:01] and morning star. He's the fairest of
[1:21:04] 10,000 to my soul.
[1:21:08] He will never never leave me nor yet
[1:21:11] forsake me here. While I live by faith
[1:21:14] and do his blessed will.
[1:21:18] A wall of fire about me. I have nothing
[1:21:22] down to fear. With his man he my hungry
[1:21:25] soul shall fill.
[1:21:28] And then sweeping up to glory to see his
[1:21:32] blessed face where rivers of delight
[1:21:35] shall ever. Oh hallelujah. He's the lily
[1:21:39] of the valley. The ring morning star.
[1:21:43] He's the fairest of 10,000 to my soul.
[1:21:48] Well, I found a friend in Jesus. He's
[1:21:52] everything to me. He's the fairest of
[1:21:55] 10,000 to my soul. Oh, the lily of the
[1:22:00] valley and him alone I see. All I need
[1:22:05] to cleanse and make me fully whole.
[1:22:09] And though all the world forsake me and
[1:22:12] Satan temps me sore, through Jesus I
[1:22:15] shall safely reach the goal. Hallelujah.
[1:22:19] He's the lily of the valley, the bright
[1:22:22] and morning star. He's the fairest of
[1:22:26] 10,000 to my soul.
[1:22:29] Fill my way every day with love
[1:22:34] as I walk with a heavenly love.
[1:22:39] Let me go all the while with a song and
[1:22:43] a smile. Fill my way every day with
[1:22:48] love.
[1:22:50] Let me walk blessed Lord in the way.
[1:22:53] Thou hast gone, leading straight to the
[1:22:56] land above.
[1:23:00] Giving cheer everywhere to the sad and
[1:23:04] low. Fill my way every day with love.
[1:23:09] Oh, fill my way every day with love
[1:23:15] as I walk with a heavenly love.
[1:23:20] Let me go all the while with a song and
[1:23:24] a smile. Fill my way every day with
[1:23:28] love.
[1:23:30] Keep me close to the side of my Savior
[1:23:34] and God. Let me never in darkness road.
[1:23:40] Keep my path free from wrath and my soul
[1:23:43] satisfied. Fill my way every day with
[1:23:48] love.
[1:23:50] Fill my way every day with love.
[1:23:55] As I walk with the heavenly love.
[1:24:00] Let me go all the while with a song.
[1:24:05] Fill my way every day with love.
[1:24:09] And soon the race will be over. And I'll
[1:24:13] travel no more, but abide in my home
[1:24:17] above.
[1:24:20] Let me sing, blessed King, all the way
[1:24:23] to the shore. Fill my way every day with
[1:24:28] love.
[1:24:29] Fill my way every day with love.
[1:24:34] As I walk with a heavenly love,
[1:24:39] let me go all the while with a song and
[1:24:43] a smile. Fill my way every day with
[1:24:47] love. Oh, fill my way every day with
[1:24:52] love.
[1:24:54] As I walk with a heavenly dove,
[1:24:59] let me go all the while with a song and
[1:25:03] a smile. Fill my way every day with
[1:25:07] love.
[1:25:10] Well, I'm so glad I'm a part
[1:25:14] of the family
[1:25:17] of God.
[1:25:19] I've been washed in the fountain.
[1:25:24] Cleansed by his blood.
[1:25:29] Join tears with Jesus as we travel this
[1:25:35] song.
[1:25:37] For I'm part
[1:25:39] of the family,
[1:25:42] the family of God.
[1:25:46] You may notice that we say brother
[1:25:51] and sister
[1:25:53] around here.
[1:25:55] It's because
[1:25:57] we're a family
[1:26:00] and these folks are so near.
[1:26:05] When one has a heartache,
[1:26:09] we all share the tears
[1:26:13] and rejoice
[1:26:16] in each victory
[1:26:18] in this family so dear.
[1:26:23] I'm so glad
[1:26:25] I'm a part
[1:26:27] of the family
[1:26:30] of God.
[1:26:32] I've been washed

[1:27:03] of an orphanage to the house of a king,
[1:27:10] no longer
[1:27:12] an outcast,
[1:27:15] a new song I sing.
[1:27:19] From
[1:27:22] unite to riches,
[1:27:24] from the weak to the strong.
[1:27:28] I'm not worthy
[1:27:31] to be.
[1:27:33] But praise God, I belong.
[1:27:38] I'm so glad
[1:27:41] I'm a part
