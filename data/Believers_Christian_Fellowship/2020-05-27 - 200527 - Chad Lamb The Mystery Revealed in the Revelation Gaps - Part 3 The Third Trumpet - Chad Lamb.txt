TRANSCRIPT
========================================
oh fill my lift [Music] [Music] [Music] here's my [Music] is that your prayer tonight [Music] [Music] ah [Music] [Music] me oh let's sing it one more time as brother chad comes i lift [Music] is [Music] jesus [Music] god bless you all praise the lord it's good to be here together again let's take our bibles while we're standing and turn to genesis chapter one we'll get right into the word this evening and i appreciate the worship the atmosphere of worship and once again i come full to overflowing but praise be to god we're trusting in him to do what we can't do amen i was i was telling the brothers i told several people this you know when god grants revelation it's such a mysterious thing because revelation doesn't come to your brain it comes to your heart all right and then god grants us some understanding there's things that pieces start to come together but he revelation comes to the heart and then when you try to process it through the brain and bring it out in speech and put it together the only thing you can do is mess up pure revelation you know when you go to preach it that's the same way god drops something into your heart and you know it's true and you know it you get it you got it but as soon as you're trying to process that process that through a human brain and speak it through human lips all of a sudden it begins to fall apart and so when you come to preaching you have to just have faith that god said by the preaching of the word because it's incapable of portraying a perfect divine revelation it's incapable but all we can do is preach it according to the anointing he gives and trust the holy ghost to put it together in the heart on the other end and that's the only thing we have to go on is that he said do it this way this is the way we're going to do it and we have faith in him so i just appreciate you pulling on the gift and bearing with me amen as i tried to just share what's on my heart or continuing on in the same subject of the the gaps or whatever we titled it but something about gaps in the book of revelation but but praise the lord we're just going to continue down that vein and trust that god will continue to open more and more to us and and i'd like to say again i'm not going to say everything right because i i i'm treading down this path that god's leading down and i may get i may say something wrong i may just get some date in the wrong place i may say something wrong so don't fixate on one phrase that i say i think he was wrong there look at the picture that's being painted because that's the real important part because i'm going to mess something up along the way i can guarantee that so don't look at that one single brush stroke down in the corner and be like ah brother chad i think a little blue green would have been better than blue and you're probably right but the point is what's the picture that's being painted let's see the picture together amen don't lock down on one thing and and if there's something that's a little bit not right god will straighten it up i'm sure of it amen and god will use the body to do that too but let's look at the picture that's being painted and see what god's sharing with us in this hour that we live let's look here at revelation chapter 1 verse 1 again i want to get very familiar with this because if we can bring up the powerpoint we'll see we're going to show this picture of the bible again and in my bible in this bible it says the revelation of saint john the divine at wrong verse 1 the revelation of jesus christ that's what we want to understand as we begin to read this book of revelation in revelation chapter 1 verse 1 we want to recognize that this is the revelation of jesus christ that's why this book matters so much to us and that's why god was sent a prophet in our day to bring us through the book of revelation because this book is the revelation of jesus christ it's the capstone to the bible it's the headstone and so let's read this again the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john do you see yourself in that verse i don't know about you but i see myself in that verse and when i see myself in that verse i see an angel and i see myself and i see the revelation and i get pretty excited amen let's just bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you for this day and this privilege lord to be together we ask all that you would take lord this flawed human vessel lord this these lips of clay lord with all the inabilities lord and all the nervousness and everything that goes with it i pray that you would just pick that up in your hand and use it for your glory lord i pray that you administer your word lord right into our hearts lord and let it grow in in our hearts and begin to bear fruit lord for that's why you sent your word to us to bear the fruit of your very own life i pray lord that you would just grant that you could have preeminence in this place that you would drive out every wrong idea every wrong spirit lord and that you would present your word to your bride in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated i'm going to hit a little bit of review we've been talking the last few services and as we go through there's so much information i don't want to get lost in the information so that we miss the picture because the picture's important not all the information although i love all the details every detail to me matters every little tiny detail i get excited about it matters to me but the more important than catching every detail of everything i say is catching the picture amen catching the revelation the vein of what god is trying to bring so i'm going to try my very best to do review do some review and then take another step and do some review and take another step and brother finger's got the whiteboard app hooked up here for me in case i get off on a tangent which i love getting off in a tangent but i don't want to i don't want to do anything confusing i don't want to do too much i just want to take bites out of this and let god reveal it to us when when brother banham preached the seals he said my bible became a new book and and we know that we're familiar with that but you have to remember brother brennan was a prophet all the way through and he was a prophet all the way through and god was giving revelation on the word all the way through i mean he caught serpent seed water baptism in jesus name the oneness of the god and all of these things he was preaching before the seals and god was given it by divine revelation to him and sometimes by vision he was telling him amen he would have three rainbows appear not just in vision but three literal rainbows appear and all going to one place when he was out hunting and then a voice would say amen the voice would say jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new so this is divine leadership and interpretation of the bible and brother branham had it throughout his ministry right and he was a prophet all the way along but even after all of that he said after the seals my bible became a new book to me that means this is this is something amazing for a man like that who've been preaching all of those years as a prophet with divine revelation still when he came to the seals and saw the opening of the seals his bible became a new book he says when those seals come open he said that opened up the entire bible so so that means for brother bannon it wasn't that he learned new verses it wasn't that he got a new version of the bible but all of a sudden another layer was peeled off of the bible so that he could see it in another way or see it in a new way or i would should say maybe see it in a deeper way and and begin to see the bible although he knew this and preaches but see the bible for me i'll just take my my own personal experience to begin to see the bible as one story not as separate books and separate stories but to see the bible as one story to see the bible old testament new testament the whole thing see the bible trying to declare one purpose one goal that god had in the back part of his mind and the whole bible has been trying to express this one thing that god has wanted to express and he divided it into three parts get preeminence in a man he did that in christ jesus preeminence and a bride he's doing that now in a people he's doing that now amen and to return them back to eden amen now all of a sudden everything in the bible lines up with that one purpose god had the one goal the one thing that he wanted to achieve in all the bible amen so when we when we get down in uh details and start to say well i'm confused i'm i'm missing all this back up and say what's the whole purpose the old purpose is for god amen to get one man and his bride back together again on the earth fully portraying what god is that's the whole purpose every type every shadow every story in the bible has been trying to tell this story so that we can come to the very end after after thousands of years of of compiling the bible through different prophets and different writers getting it all together so that a prophet could come at the end time and point it back and say this has all been telling one story and that one story is god wanted to be known amen so he separated himself into attributes and god wanted to be known by his attributes and display himself in his attributes and have fellowship together as a family of attributes and to do it that way he first showed the perfect image of it in eden he let it fall so that he could sow his seed into all the earth and bring them right back to where they were and all of the seed all of these attributes would know him who he was they would know him because they went through the contrast of evil through the contrast of black and darkness so that they would now understand god because the angels worshiped god and they saw him as almighty god an all-powerful god and creator of heavens and earth but they didn't understand god because they never experienced good and evil so god allowed all of this so that he could express himself so that god could be expressed as a family attributes that he could fellowship together with his family and be known by those who would love him and worship him and to do it he created the image of male and female amen let it fall so that he could get back the perfect male which was jesus christ to redeem back all that was lost to bring amen the female which is his bride unite them back together and put them back in eden so when all the information just gets to be information and we lose sight of that we need to back up again and look at the picture again and then when you go back down to the information every story every detail everything that brother branham was preaching is all pointing to the same story so we just don't want to get lost in the details but we don't want to say the details don't matter because they all matter every jot and every tittle matters and what the prophet said matters and i'm gonna have to fix something on my tablet all right now we're back in business okay let's just keep going a little further he said this is the quote that i've used each time we'll walk in the light the beautiful light one step at a time lord coming closer to him yeah children of the light accept his word keep walking and watch more unfold don't leave it no matter what somebody else says to me that's the most important part of the phrase don't leave it no matter how many critics say it's not right how many doubts they can show you how many conflicts they can show in the message or conflicts in the life of brother ben don't leave this word don't move away from it amen because that's all distractions trying to get us to turn our head and move away but if we'll stick with it and keep moving forward with the word you watch it'll unfold itself but everybody the the attributes the seed of god must be tested to see if they have faith and in that test he'll let he'll let discrepancies come to the surface seeming discrepancies he'll let inconsistencies come to the service he'll let problems come to the service and wrong dates and and wrong whatever and he'll show you where or you know he'll allow the enemy to show you where brother branham gave a figure two or three different places concerning the same event or the same day like when he's baptizing and the ohio river right if you look at the quotes brother bram says he was baptizing in june he was baptizing in july and he was baptizing in august there was 500 on the bank there was a thousand on the bank there was 5 000 people on the bank right and sometimes it was 1930 and sometimes it was 1933 if you look at all the quotes right but one thing never changes is he was baptizing the 17th person and a pillar of fire came down because it wasn't important in the month it wasn't important exactly the day the important part of that story is the pillar of fire came down and said as john the baptist was sent before that never changed no matter how many times it was told no matter how many times he repeated the story those two elements did not change because that was the point of the story well why would god let him say it that way because it's perfectly designed to only attract and keep the bride because only the bride is supposed to make it all the way through to the end with this message and to do that you're gonna have to stay with it stick with it no matter what anybody else says stick with it stay right in that and just keep walking with it and watch it unfold and reveal itself just think of what would happen to us those who we've been here in this church for a long period of time go back six years amen when the previous pastor denounced the message where would we be if we had left then and what would we have missed seeing now what do you have to do no matter what anybody else says about it stick with it and keep walking in it the light of the hour and watch it unfold itself praise be to god review's going really slow as slide number one but it's so important it's so critically important amen somebody can show you inconsistencies i can show you inconsistencies somebody can show you questions i can show you a question there's things brother ben said i don't know what he means but i know he knows what he's talking about but explain it i can't explain it i'm not even going to try to explain it i'm just going to wait and keep walking in it and watch it unfold itself because it will unfold itself because this is the mystery that he's given to his bride he's whispering the love secrets to her and he wants her to know amen and so there's things that are going to continue to unfold we just got to stick with it and watch it unfold itself we're not going to unfold it we need to rest assured in the fact that we as human beings are not going to unfold this word and unfold this truth we're going to keep walking in it and stick with it and watch it unfold itself praise be to god that's always the temptation to try to unfold it ourselves but we have to wait handwriting on the wall he says now any bible reader here knows that all scripture has a compound meaning every prophecy some most of all of it has a duel a dual time or two times or more that it will that it'll be answered as a revolving history this is important when we're talking about this because as we start talking about uh going through the the uh the seals and the trumpets and the vials we know that there's a cycle of seals trumpets and vials designated under the end time sign which is the seventh seal which is the end time seal right and those events are going to unfold at the end time amen but these events the the trumpets seals and vials have been going on from the very beginning and brother banham shows us that trumpet seals and vials have been going on through the church ages he said a church-age messenger will come break a seal he'll sound a trumpet it'll declare spiritual war amen and they'll gather to the truth amen it'll start a spiritual war and then and then after their sea of that group sealed away he'll pour out a plague on all those who rejected it so you can find you can see seals trumpets vials through the whole bible amen because every scripture has a compound meaning and a compound revelation sometimes two times or more so the same scripture you could say well this scripture means that and and somebody says no this scripture means that and the truth is it's both correct well this was fulfilled then no no no this is going to be fulfilled in the future and you can say they're both correct and if we don't let that happen we're going to get ourselves tangled up in the weeds somewhere because we're going to say no it's this it can't be that or no it's this it can't be that when the fact is it was this and it will be this so those are important lessons to realize don't don't say well i've already figured out what that scripture means it means this and nothing else no god can use that prophecy again in a revolving history that's why we can see the seals oh praise god can we turn the white board on i just want to look at the seals all the way back in genesis and i'm just i'm just doing this as an example i mean just just take it as an example but you have jacob all right jacob is going to have a name change he's going to become israel but right now he's jacob now there was a prophecy given in genesis 25 and it was given to his mother amen because she was she was in turmoil because there was great turmoil within her womb and and she sought the lord and the lord said there are two nations within thy womb and one shall be stronger than the other and the elders shall serve the younger now when he gives that prophecy the elder shall serve the younger right then and there you've got the picture of election right there that is election neither one being born neither having done good or evil but by the purpose of election might stand he has said jacob have i loved but esau have i hated and right here when she sought the lord he spoke right to her so now you see jacob is under a covenant of grace but jacob leaves the homeland he goes off and we're just going to we're just going to show this as a picture of the church as well we're going to look at 1 two three four seals now don't get bogged down in red horse white horse and all that i'm just trying to show patterns patterns patterns patterns through four seals we have an entire bride coming out is that right the whole church that god is going to redeem the whole bride is coming out through four through through let's say four seals four stages of the wheat plant four stages of the bride tree right he's it was destroyed down and it comes back through four stages so through four seals is going to come forth the entire bride but in the old testament through jacob is going to come through forth the entire nation of israel is that right the whole church basically is going to come out of jacob so jacob delivers 12 sons through four women right one two three four out of the four comes the whole church out of four seals comes the whole bride you see the pattern so first is leah the next is bilhah i think next is zil pa and then rachel all right but why did you list them that way because that's the way they give birth lee is the first one to bring forth then bilna then zilpah then leo brings forth again the sixth son that she brings forth rachel's the last one to bring forth why is rachel the last one to bring forth because rachel's a type of the bride and leah is a tribe of the old testament church because he wanted brother branham said from the beginning god always wanted a gentile bride so he said he always wanted a gentile bride so now when jacob goes down amen what's he doing he's portraying the seals he's bringing the seals out uh what he wanted was a gentile bride but before he could get a gentile bride he went down and he asked for the gentile bride yes you can i'm calling rachel the gentile bride those day brother chad your way off scriptures you just listen to what i'm saying get the picture he wants he wants rachel because god always wanted a gentile bride he wants rachel but he has to work seven years for her which is one sabbath or one cycle of completion and look at that as the old testament so he's got to work and after he works seven years he's going to get his bride amen but when when he takes his bride he recognizes that's not the one i wanted i want the gentile bride this is leah the old testament bride she wasn't beautiful to him she had kind eyes but he wanted the beautiful rachel so he gets leah and at the same time he gets leah he goes back to laban and he said you did me a trick here and labor said that's the way it is you've got to take the older one first so christ had to come and he had to redeem the old church first so got a cycle of the old testament cycle of seven and he says now laban says i'll give you rachel if you promise to work us another cycle of seven through seven church ages to complete the new testament and he says deal so he gets rachel right then not after seven years right then because at pentecost you see the bride coming forth and then it goes right into gentiles and then he's got these two wives he redeemed the old church and now he's got rachel but in order to fully redeem rachel he's got to stay with laban and he's got to labor for another cycle of seven through the new testament through seven church ages then after seven church ages he can take what he's redeemed and go back home do you see the picture you know don't get bogged down in details look at the picture the picture's beautiful so rachel can't bring forth why can't she bring forth because because it's the story it's always difficult for the right woman to bring forth life always through travail leah can produce then then rachel she can't produce a son so she takes her handmaid and that's bilna and she gives it to her husband and and bilna produces two sons and then when leah recognizes she's not bringing four children anymore she gives her handmaid which is zilpah unto her husband and he and zilpah brings forth two more after that leah conceives again and has the sixth son unto jacob and then they're done they're not going to bring forth any more those three are going to bring forth any more but now it's time for rachel to bring forth so now when we move into the fourth wife or the fourth stage just this stay with me on the picture when you come to number four which is gonna be under the fourth seal under prophetic rachel brings forth joseph how do you spell joseph is that right praise god brings forth joseph who's joseph a prophet under the fourth seal comes a prophet who's a perfect type of jesus christ so what does rachel the bride bring forth amen at the end of this redemption cycle and how do you know it's the end because after joseph's born he goes back to laban and he says i've completed my seven years let me go back home when he sees now that a prophet has come forth from the fourth woman now he knows it's time to go back to the homeland because the prophet is on the scene now amen come out of rachel the bride praise god so now rachel is moving back into the land now joseph oh this is so good they're moving back into the land as they get closer to the land they they they they go through different troubles oh my goodness this is so good you come down to genesis where now esau's coming to get coming to get jacob jacob moves into jacob's trouble amen it puts him in desperation he crosses the the stream by himself and goes off by himself and he encounters a man and begins to wrestle with a man so now we see that he comes through his sixth seal experience right and he begins to wrestle with a man and this experience in the sixth seal is going to change his walk forever he's going to be touched in the hollow of his thigh when he wrestles with this with his individual because he's in a state of desperation because he's in a troublesome time because he knows he's done wrong he knows he's treated esau wrong he knows he's deserving of judgment and he's deserving of esau's judgment but that puts him in desperation and when he gets in desperation he gets in isolation by himself when he gets off by himself in desperation he meets one amen he doesn't even know who he's wrestling with and remember he's wrestling with somebody who's going to change his name from jacob to israel because he has a new birth and after that new birth and the sixth seal amen the next thing he says is he names that place pinewool because i have seen god face to face after he wrestles after his name change after the blessing amen then he recognizes that was god he recognizes the seventh seal whoop i got an eraser all right do you see it he goes through all of that where's the fifth seal remember when i drew the picture for the jews it started before the first seal when before he was born the lord told her the older shall serve the younger no matter what dirty tricks he pulled no matter what deceptions no matter how much of a science there was he was elected and therefore came under the fifth seal of grace his whole life he may not have realized it until much later he may not have come in contact with the realization but because he was elected predestinated seat he was under the fifth seal of grace the whole time after jacob goes through the seven seals then he goes back into the land when he gets back into the land rachel's going to bring forth the last child the last part of the elect the last part of all of the nation and the last one that she brings forth is benjamin the forty 144 thousand brother said the hundred forty four thousand is little benjamin and little benjamin can't be birthed by those two prophets outside of the land so they've gotta get back into the promised land and as they're moving back into the land is when rachel delivers 144 000 but remember brother branham said the bride can't be here at the same time as the 144 thousand so there's there's a prophecy a shadow that's laying here that the bride has to go before the 144 thousand amen before those two witnesses begin ministering and calling out 144 000 so rachel dies at the birth of benjamin when benjamin comes forth rachel leaves at the exact same time little benjamin back in the homeland do you see the seals you see it's a revolving history so when we start to start to look at these things some things we're going to say like brother bennett said this opened here under the persecution of the jews and things like that but you can find that same seal effective all over the place all the way back to even after the jews rejected christ amen and there was a persecution that came through titus you can see the sixth seal break open there but when we're talking about these things we're talking about the end time sequence amen that happens under the seventh seal which is the end of time seal does that make sense are we all together on that so don't don't don't say but this happened here and this happened here it's not just there yeah it's not just there but we're just showing it in this this time frame so another interesting thing on joseph when you count the birth order of all of jacob's children joseph is number 11. if you move further down in the book of genesis joseph gets separated from his brethren sent to egypt he's there they're going to come together and now it's time for joseph to reveal himself to his brethren and he can't do it to little benjamin's there so they work out all the details to get benjamin there when benjamin comes then joseph reveals himself amen and joseph is a perfect type of christ amen and so now christ is going to reveal himself to his brethren the jews when all 12 were assembled little benjamin's back present now he's going to present himself to his brethren when in revelations chapter 11 so in birth order joseph is number 11. what's it foreshadowing revelations 11 because when brother brahm talks about those two witnesses he goes right back to genesis and talks about joseph revealing himself to his brethren when little benjamin shows up that makes benjamin 12 benjamin 12 which completes that church but there's other places in the scripture that counts the sons of israel the sons of jacob differently they don't count them in birth order they count them first by all the sons that are born through leah the first wife and then by the sons that are born through rachel the second wife and then counts the tons of the concubines so you can count them both ways because the scripture counts them both ways and leah had six sons before joseph come by so when you count just the sons of the wives joseph is also number seven completion a perfect type of christ the seventh seal revealing himself as the seventh trumpet to his brethren and that makes little benjamin number eight praise god i tell you i don't know about you but little things like that absolutely thrill my heart and i feel edified amen i feel edified amen and purified by a spirit when you can see the same it's the same story of redemption taking place here and here and here and here and that's why once you catch the pattern once you see the pattern amen you can see it everywhere you look and that's why for me when brother brennan makes a statement when he when when he opened the seals he opened up the entire bible he said after the seals my bible became a new book my experience is after i caught the revelation of redemption amen the threefold purpose the great mystery of the whole book now my bible became a new book it took the seals off the whole bible now it's not a story about jacob it's not a story about rachel it's a story about me i'm rachel amen why because the gentile bride is the one who carries christ amen and brings forth christ in this day and gives that word back to the jews story about me bringing forth they couldn't bring forth couldn't bring forth couldn't bring forth because she's pressed it predestinated not to bring forth just another church member just another a church a denominational member but she is predestinated to bring forth joseph number seven a type of jesus christ brother ben said a perfect type of jesus christ and he was perfection amen so she was predestined to bring forth amen that's why through the seven church ages you don't see replicated the life of christ the life of christ the life of christ until you get to the seventh and then rachel is going to now bring forth joseph that's why it's been the long dry spell that's why amen because the true bride amen church members can bring forth church members all day long but the true bride has always had trouble bringing forth there was a difficulty bringing forth and sarah difficulty bringing forth and rebecca difficulty bringing forth and rachel why because the right woman always has trouble bringing forth because she can't make anything happen herself she has to wait for the predestinated time to bring forth and that's why the true bride in every church amen was not bringing forth joseph not bringing forth joseph till the end of that seven year cycle and at the end of the seven year cycle she brings forth joseph and it's manifest by a prophet with the son of man ministry doing everything that jesus christ did yes see this is our whole life the whole bible is our whole life and now we find ourselves in the seals so what are the seals about white horse red horse black yes yes and no it's that and so much more it's that and everything else included and like i said like i said from the beginning brother ben said i've mapped this out and draw this out and i may not have it exactly right so forgive me if i don't have it exactly right but i know it's the truth [Music] amen if we can go back to the powerpoint please all right so i i'm doing a slow slow job of review scripture has a compound meaning every prophecy some most all of it has a dual time or two times or more that it'll be answered as a revolving history then out came wesley he saw that big organized organization so he sounded a trumpet so brother man now talking about in the church ages wesley is sounding a trumpet of sanctification more of the words see when he did out they moved right out right out of luther right in the methodist and when pentecost saw it they sounded a trumpet it's time for the return of the gifts see what did they do they sounded a trumpet and now they came so brother ma'am showing that there has been trumpets through the church ages and the trumpets and the church ages are doing the same thing that the trumpets are doing to the jews they're calling the people back to the word back to the truth amen luther brought him back to justification amen wesley brought him back to sanctification the pentecostals brought him back to the gifts of the spirit so the trumpets are doing the same thing to the church that they're doing to israel the jews brother i said on in the sixth seal trumpets always denotes war the messenger the angel come on earth the messenger of the hour like luther like any of the messengers that we've talked of what does he do he arrives in a seal open reveals a trumpet sounds war declared and away they go and then the messenger dies he seals away this group they're put in and a plague falls upon those who reject it see and then it goes on they organize get another organization so brother branham is showing us through the church ages we've had seals trumpets vials before the church ages we've had seals trumpets vials after the church ages we're going to see the completion of seals trumpets vials all right brother says now i'm continuing with this thought the eighth chapter only reveals the scene of the scene he's talking about revelation chapter eight for the seventh seal only reveals the scene of the seventh seal where nothing else is revealed now nothing is not revealed in the seventh seal nothing is not revealed that means something's revealed but it's not said nothing is not revealed oh that's a big statement friends that's a it may have been a slip of the tongue it may have been a grammatical error but it's still the truth now has nothing to do with the seventh chapter of revelation it's the revealing of the seven seals perfectly mute and i've only had time i'll try a few places to show you all the way back from genesis the seventh after the seventh seal is spoke of from the very beginning in genesis this these seals move right on up so that's what brother bram was telling us this seven seals all the way back in the beginning of genesis and he says right from genesis these seals are moving up i just showed you one place so we can see the seals everywhere the whole bible when he took the seals off he unlocked the whole bible so where do you see the seventh seal coming up in genesis in the beginning god from the in the beginning in genesis to the amen to end of revelations brother branham says is all christ all speaking of christ and christ is the mystery of god revealed the seventh seal so the whole bible is the seventh seal right the whole creation because all things were made by him and for him and without him was not anything that was made and by him all things consist so where does that seventh seal come up from genesis in the beginning god created heavens and earth how did he create heavens and earth with christ everything was made by him and for him and without him nothing was made that was made and by him all things that were made consistent praise be to god and from there it just keeps rolling on all right now we're going to look at our gaps again really quickly just very quickly just to review it between the seven church ages and the seven seals you have the breach which is a gap between the church ages and the seals and brother branham makes this statement now he says i'm just going to drop down to the bold part because i would like to strike again at the seven last trumpets and it all bridges together and then they're in the seven last plagues and it all blends right together as we'll see as we go along the second seal says you see there there's seven vials you know these sevens as we going through they all happen right at the same time following the plagues following the church ages just the same because it's all sealed up into that one book everything and everything happens just in rotation and one goes right into the other and the other into the other kind of like a roman candle going off and out from one goes five more bursts and out from that goes five more bursts and right one rotates right into the other right into the other right into the other praise god in the message thinking man's filter he says i'm anxiously waiting for the hour to where we can all congregate in one place and preach on those seven plagues seven vials seven trumpets and so forth they all happen right in a cluster that's the reason i'll take us about a week 10 days or more to get through it in one single meeting if we can my brother brother says they all happen right in the cluster just to me what i'm seeing is he's talking about under the seventh seal the end of time seal that wraps up everything when the roman candle goes off it ends time for denominations then it ends time for this then it ends time for this and it's time for that all the way into the ushering into the millennium so it all happens right in that cluster right in that cluster between the second and third woe between world war ii and world war iii now let's move on to the next gap in the seals we go through first five seals seal six seal number seven and then the gap between the seals and in the gap between the seals amen you start off and when you're at home just read back and forth through these because it takes some time to get acquainted with what's going on but they're all interlaced together so in between the sixth and seventh seal you have revelation chapter seven in chapter seven you have four angels amen that are holding back the four winds and an angel with the seal of god comes and says hold back the wind don't hurt the trees don't hurt anything until we finish sealing amen all of the servants right we got to seal them all on the forehead and so now these four angels which we saw four angels released out of euphrates in world war ii amen and with that came the army of uh uh of demons that went into the the armies of hitler mussolini and stalin so these four angels and brother bam said these four angels controlling the winds he said winds are wars and strife and so when we just saw in world war ii under the sixth seal the sixth trumpet sound these four uh angels were released the the army came out went into the armies of hitler mussolini and stalin amen and they brought a bitter persecution against the jews and now we find in the gap between the six and seven seal that now he says hold back don't harm wait until we're done sealing amen we can't bring more war world war three amen until we're done sealing the 144 000 who does that it's the ministry of two prophets so the the the revelation of the trumpets and the mystery of two prophets come between the six and seven seal see that all right then you have trumpets in between the sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet is revelation chapter 10 and most of revelation chapter 11. you have the prophets ministry and the ministry of the the two prophets the two witnesses in revelation chapter 11. and in between the prophets ministry and in the ministry of the two prophets the two witnesses and that go to moses and elijah that go to the jews what do you have in between those two mysteries you have the ministry of of the seventh angel you have the ministry of the two witnesses but right in between there you have a little bride who's going to take the book and eat the book and prophesy again so you have the ministry of the bride in between the ministry of the the seventh angel and the ministry of the two witnesses where in the gap between the sixth and seventh trumpet praise be to god i love this feast the trumpets the gathering of israel is the trumpets the trumpets is to gather israel this is why brother ben was told you're not to preach it you've already preached it supernaturally under the sixth seal because this takes place under the sixth seal and you already talked about it but the revelation of what all those trumpets are that'll be taken care of by two witnesses and brother there's the seventh trumpet to the jews is what the sixth seal was to the gentiles and the sixth seal was christ who came to reveal the seals so the the seventh trumpet is the brings them to the feast of atonement which is christ there's their slain lamb all right brother brown goes down the gathering of israel to the trumpets the trumpeses to gather israel now he goes to the first trumpet in revelation chapter 8 and he says the very first trumpet sound blood fire hail everything scattered the ground what was he doing bringing israel out of spiritual egypt see back into the homeland see he's showing the same thing that happened in egypt when moses showed up in egypt moses showed up and broke open the sixth seal in egypt brought plagues down and broke open the sixth seal in egypt and out of that what was he doing he was calling them to the homeland so it's the same thing that's taking place again the feast of trumpets again he says it's been the time of the pentecostal feast that's the church ages the jews is laid silent they rejected it now they've got to be called back to the atonement we know who the atonement was they didn't and the trumpet sound and after the pentecostal jubilee calls the jews together can't you see how that trumpet of persecution under hitler and then blasted and the jews was forced to come together to fulfill the scriptures that's why brother brahm says the holocaust was the tender hand of jehovah because those two witnesses can't show up and and 144 000 cannot be called outside of the promised land they've got to come back to the promised land so god will construct events around the whole planet to bring them back home why because jacob couldn't be satisfied in laban's house because jacob was very prosperous in laban's house and the jews had been very prosperous in all the world that they had went and they were prospering amen and brother brenham said they were they were shysters i mean i don't mean anything as to jews but brother brahm said he's always had his hand on money amen and he'll cheat you in anything to get that money and you see it right there in jacob jacob was there throwing the poplar sticks in the water to scare the cattle to have speckled calves and i don't know how all that works but it worked either way it worked and he and he had a deal all work for the speckled cattle you can have the rest and he's laboring and through trickery and then he's get his his flock is growing and growing and growing because the jews were accumulating all the paper money of the world seals explain everything and all of a sudden laban's son start getting really irritated at the prosperity of jacob and the rest of europe gets really irritated at the prosperity of the jews and start blaming them for every bit of trouble that's taking place and all of a sudden anti-semitism is on the rise and they're getting blamed because of their prosperity and it starts a persecution amen that's going to boil over amen after those demons are released out of the uh those demons are released into the armies and it's going to bring a bitter persecution that's going to drive them back to the homeland where did you see that pattern before all the way back in genesis with jacob see now we're continuing on with what we've been saying now let me say this right here the very trumpet that blowed every trumpet that blowed blowed under the sixth seal we'll get to it in a few minutes where we caught the seal there all the trumpets sounded under the sixth seal and every trumpet sounded under the sixth seal under the persecution of the jews notice revelation now uh eighth beginning with the seventh verse all was the calling out of israel natural in egypt announced the calling out of israel in the spiritual sense it he was making them ready to come to the feast of atonement so under that sixth seal which blows at the same opens at the same time the sixth trumpet he's calling them back to the promised land here he says at the sixth seal when when it opened the persecution struck the jews in the literal standpoint and here comes the persecution to the church in the ecclesiastical standpoint because the bride is already called he said that in 1964 what are they called by they're called by an eliezer ministry they're called by a midnight hour call they're called by the same i mean the the elijah ministry the bride is already is the bride is already called the sabbaths are over ready for the jews to be called where to the feast of atonement so when when the sixth seal when it opened the persecution struck the jews now brother branham is talking in the under the seventh seal under the end time seal under the end time sequence now the feast of trump as he says luke 17 30 the revealing of the son of man malachi 4 amen turning the hearts back to the pentecostal fathers hebrews 4 12 amen all these scriptures as promised this is to be between the 6 and 7 seal and the 6th and 7th trumpet so we can see these ministries take place in the gap feast of trump is the sixth trumpet and the sixth seal sound at the same time when did the sixth trumpet sound when all those two hundred thousand thousand demons come out and went into those armies and between the sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet there is a prophet to appear before the gentiles revelation 10. to call the people back to the original pentecostal doctrine and the two witnesses of revelation 11 appear to the jews to send them to jesus while the church is being taken up why because rachel has to get off the scene the same time the 144 000 are coming the same time benjamin's coming forth rachel's leaving i love the bible now in the vials you have seven vials but in between the vials you have a gap and in that gap you have three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of three different individuals the brotherhood said that trinity doctrine been laying there all the time but when did it come out to reveal itself when when does it manifest when was it revealed it was revealed under that prophet's ministry showing that that prophet's ministry is in the gap in the sixth and seventh vial praise god then you have uh then he says i uh behold i cometh as a thief that's in the gap and then you have them gathering those spirits gathering them to the battle of armageddon all takes place in the gap there's a lot happening in these gaps but one revolves into another and revolves into another like a roman candle going on brother remember says i was coming back rather here to try to have about a 10-day meeting to speak on the subject of the last seven last vials for in between those vials is the trumpets now brother bram says now the trumpets are in between the vials amen and that's the ministry of the two witnesses are going to be giving the revelation of the trumpets in that time frame now we're looking at the gap now i'm not doing all this in chronological order i'm just trying to explain something here the gap between the six and seven seal the gap between the sixth and seventh trumpet and the gap between the vials in the seals the seals introduce christ to the gentiles seventh seal the seventh trumpet introduces christ to the jews and the seventh vial the viles prepares the earth for christ's millennium so you see everything's being taken care of in this end time sequence the gentiles the jews and the purging of the earth you have a prophet's ministry and the ministry of two witnesses that go through the gap under the seals you have a prophet's ministry you get the complete revelation of christ and the rapture starts with a shout under the trumpets you have the ministry of the two prophets 144 000 are called and they recognize christ the true atonement and in the vials between the vials you have three unclean spirits come out he comes as the thief in the night the rapture and they gather to the battle of armageddon we see all that now i want to go back to this i did a little drawing but brother franco has a slide for me if we look at the seals one two three four five six seven seals we talked last time about not not forcing ourselves to take them in chronological order remember that and when we free ourselves from taking a chronological order now all of a sudden everything begins to fit what the prophet of god was telling us you have through the church ages you have four anointings that come out from the antichrist spirit to bring destruction but you've got four anointings amen that come from the spirit of christ to combat those anointings all the way through the church ages i say all the way through the church ages and beyond because we know that eagle anointing jumps over in the tribulation period on those two witnesses so you've got that but the fifth seal souls on the altar as far as chronology it spans the church ages right because brother bram says those souls under the altar he goes those that stayed true to the word though they were blinded so that he could turn to the gentiles so they can call out a gentile bride because he blinded them he did not hold them accountable for what he blinded them to he only held them accountable for what they could see and what they could see was the law of moses so it wasn't that i'd like to say it this way so we can understand it wasn't that grace says you can do anything that you want and everything's going to be fine no grace says i'll cover for the part i won't let you see as long as you accept the word that i have opened to you they could not have rejected the law of moses they could not have rejected the prophets they could not have rejected those things because that was given to them and opened to them and once it was given to them to reject that was to reject life but they accepted the part that was opened but they could not see what he blinded them to and because he blinded him to that he did not hold them accountable for not seeing it and so now grace takes effect because they're in the last book of life and they're given white robes and that takes place he said from the time of christ on so the reason i say this for a very specific reason if i say brother branham comes between the gap and the sixth and seventh trumpet and the sixth and seventh file when we start thinking chronology you says well then that means all six trumpets are gone and he comes after six trumpets are done he comes after six vials are done i never said that i said what brother branham said these things take place between the six and seven five and the sixth and seventh trumpet and the sixth and seventh seal but who said that just because the sixth trumpet opens and in fact who said that that means that you already had a completion of the first five trumpets nobody said that brother bram didn't say that i didn't say that [Music] did anybody say that the first five vials were already poured out an effect on the earth i never said that i didn't see brother graham say that but he did say the sixth trumpet sounded it opened and those demons came out and those four angels were released he did say that he did point to the the the sixth vial when euphrates dried up and he started showing that there was a pagan system acting christian couldn't cross over but now they can cross over to the other side crossing euphrates so now you can see all this takes place between the sixth and seventh but if we break the idea of chronology you can have the sixth trumpet spanning all these other trumpets can happen in between because you do that with the fifth seal and if it works with the fifth seal why would it work with the sixth trumpet and why wouldn't it work with the sixth file i'm not saying that i know what they are i don't know what they are but i'm just saying what you see true in the scriptures is true and if that seal can can come into effect for the souls on the altar before the first church age all the way through amen then why can't the sixth trumpet already be open even if the other five hadn't blown yet it can just let it be true because brother branham said the six the six trumpets open he said it so let it be true but don't make that equal all five or finished don't do that does that make sense the same thing with the sixth file when he points to the ecumenical movement amen in the paganism from the kings of the east the syrian babylonian religion moving over into christianity amen when he make when he makes that correlation that's fine that's true i believe that with all my heart and between that time amen and the seventh vial amen there's a gap and in that gap there's a ministry that reveals to us the three unclean spirits the rapture sets in and then there's a gathering to the battle of armageddon that's all true but that doesn't mean the first five vials have already poured out and taken effect upon the earth they have in the church ages there's a revolving history could it have happened in the church ages and could it happen again during the tribulation period yeah i don't know i'm not saying i'm not drawing the conclusion but were there viles poured out in the church ages yes will there be plagues that fall in the three and a half year tribulation yes who's going to bring those plagues those two witnesses brother branham says so let's not draw conclusions that that brother branham didn't draw let's just let what he says be true this came between the sixth and seventh trumpet the sixth trumpet and the sixth seal open at the same time that's true that doesn't mean there can't be another sequence that doesn't mean there won't be another revolving history and there hasn't been before this is what he says is true even the sixth seal he says the sixth seal and the sixth trumpet open at the same time and he ties it to the persecution to the jews that's been recently he says and then talking about coming to world war ii and that happened between the third and fourth church age or be the third and fourth seal right and then the coming of the lord i mean the seventh seal is from genesis to revelation and the everything so let's not get dogmatic and let's not get natural in our thinking let's let's let what brother bram said be absolutely true and not make it fit our own picture but say god give me the right picture of what he's saying let me just say what he said and believe what he said to be true and then you have to show us the rest of it now there's a reason i said this oh my goodness this is where i'm going to get in trouble and i love you guys and you love me but i just want to share something that i saw and i don't want to draw a conclusion i don't want to say this is that but i just want to show something out of the scriptures so let's look to revelation chapter 8. revelation chapter 8 the trumpets begin in revelation chapter 8 verse 7 with the first trumpet but i want to go to verse 10 and look at the third trumpet and the third angel sounded and there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters and the name of the star is called wormwood and the third part of the waters became wormwood and men and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter all right that's this scripture right here and and this word wormwood is very very interesting under the third trumpet now i i want to make a disclaimer here i'm just sharing with you something that i see and i have no authority to say this is that i just want to share something because i want you to see something so just let me be your brother i'm not i'm not a prophet i'm not taking the authority of a prophet but i just see something when you look at an event in history from 1986 there was an event called the nuclear meltdown in chernobyl we remember that i was a young boy but there was a nuclear meltdown in chernobyl and the word chernobyl is a ukrainian word and it used some places in rural russia for a weed called wormwood so this is out this is taken out of an article from july 26 1986 from the new york times and there's a little clip out of that article it says a prominent russian writer showed from a ukrainian dictionary the word for wormwood a bitter wild herb uses a tonic in rural russia chernobyl so chernobyl in many places means wormwood that's interesting but it's just that just interesting chernobyl means wormwood this is a monument that was set down in 2011 across the parking lot from a museum in the center of chernobyl does anybody recognize what that is it's a trumpeting angel the monument is called the monument of the third angel on purpose i mean they tied it right to revelation it's not that it's not some mysterious thing they they started talking when chernobyl had a nuclear meltdown it contaminated the waters it contaminated the rain there was contamination that spread through dust throughout eastern europe as far away as into russia and then to sweden and finland and all of that and it and it got in the rain and got in the waters all kinds of nuclear fallout nuclear mess that took place it was a big big deal in that part of the world but in 2011 on the 25th anniversary of chernobyl amen they set a monument in the middle chernobyl and that monument they sit there they title the monument of the third angel and it's a trumpeting angel that also is interesting if you look in the background you see that building across the parking lot there or the driveway or whatever that is that building is called the star wormwood museum the star wormwood museum you can go on google maps and type it in and it'll take you right to the spot to the center of chernobyl in the northern part of ukraine that's interesting that's super interesting now that's all can be anecdotal that's all interesting and i looked at this i had somebody tell me about this and i looked at i thought well that's interesting and i just sat on it because i mean what do you do with that i don't know it's interesting but the chernobyl means wormwood there's a nuclear meltdown it's a major catastrophe all sudden they have a museum called star wormwood they have a monument called the third angel it's a trumpeting angel all right out of the book of revelation revelation chapter 8 the third trumpet the third trumpeting angel but what got interesting for what made it interesting for me is when i was looking at something i came across a few articles and here mikhail gorbachev says he states flatly that chernobyl the chernobyl explosion was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the soviet union this is what becomes a big deal because remember the trumpets are to gather israel to the homeland that's the purpose of the trumpets and and mikhail gorbachev said that the explosion chernobyl was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the soviet union he says in another article i'm reading out of the world nuclear association it says former president gorbachev said that the chernobyl accident was more was a more important factor in the fall of the soviet union than perestrokia his program of liberal reform and the the economist published an article in april 26 2016 the 30th anniversary it says a nuclear disaster that brought down an empire chernobyl led to thousands of deaths including that of the soviet union all sudden that gets interesting then it gets interesting for a very specific reason i've got an article here i printed from june 12 2019 from the canadian jewish news it's titled the connection between chernobyl and modern jewish history chernobyl was a really active site for judaism there was a there was a big community of hasidic jews back before world war one and actually the last rabbi in chernobyl was arrested by stalin in 1933 and in prison and later he was killed in 1942 but when the nazis nazis and the german nazis when they came into ukraine they came into chernobyl and within a year's time they killed every jew that was in chernobyl so that's got a real jaded history there with the jews but but that's not really what i want to get to that's just a point of interest but it says i'm going to read right out of this article it says today the explosion of the nuclear plant in chernobyl is ground zero for the history of ukraine it is arguably the major transitional point leading to the collapse of the soviet union and consequent transformation of the world map eyewitness report rumors that the plant's explosion had been the divine punishment for ukraine and belarus for what had transpired there during the holocaust that was just some people who survived that that was what they said but when you get down here this article started to catch my attention it said tens of thousands of jews made the decision to leave the collapsing soviet union in the late 1980s primarily because of the disaster they paved the way for what became a mass exodus leading to a million and a half russian-speaking jews leaving to the living today around the globe when the ussr was standing and it was strong it it had there was there was more than a million russian-speaking jews trapped behind the lines of ussr and they could not get back to the homeland through the 1960s 70s and 80s but but as ussr as the ussr was growing in strength it was trying amen to exploit science it was trying to grow and become a world empire it was it was a global empire but they started having financial problems they started struggling amen and the collapse at chernobyl was huge and devastating to the ussr the soviet union it would trigger a series of events that started collapsing the soviet union and within six years they had totally dissolved the ussr and in that time this is 1986 by 1989 amen they had opened up the berlin wall and allowed freedom between the eastern and western berlin freedom of travel by 1991 november the berlin wall had come down and by december of 1991 the ussr had completely come down and when it completely fell amen all of a sudden the jews that had been trapped behind those lines could now go back home amen many of them for the first time and there began to be mass exoduses but they didn't all go quickly some of them still stayed behind and when they stayed behind all of a sudden little wars broke out remember chechnya remember bosnia herzegovina remember uh yugoslavia all of this region became destabilized and all these little wars broke out and the jews kept running away from wars because trumpets are wars too and started running back to the homeland and after the ussr dissolved in 1991 the years 1992 to 1995 saw the greatest years of travel of aaliyah returning to the homeland of russian-speaking jews in fact it was so big it became a problem in israel and i found a i found a peer-reviewed paper written by i believe it was a phd grad said that there's so many russian-speaking jews now coming into israel it's changing the political structure and it's changing the culture of israel and between 1989 i believe it is 1989 and 2006 almost a million russian-speaking jews go back into israel israel's a tiny country that's a million jews why because because there has to be under the trumpets an in-gathering of the jews back to the promised land amen as long as ussr was a world empire they couldn't get back they wouldn't permit a million of them to leave so i'm not drawing the conclusion i'm not saying this is that i'm just telling you what's in history what history says and chernobyl means wormwood and somebody thought enough of it to put a monument of a trumpeting angel right in the middle of town right across from a museum called star wormwood museum and brother branham said god makes them testify of the truth that's why on every ambulance there's a pole with a serpent wrapped around it amen to point back to divine healing so the reason i the reason i say that's interesting i may be wrong but it's interesting how many agree that's very very interesting if brother branham was here i'd be like brother man was that it was that it but you can see you we didn't make up the name of we didn't make up the name of the city we didn't put the angel statute trumpeting angel statue there we didn't put the museum there we didn't make the nuclear reactor fall out and we didn't make that cause the crumble of the ussr and we didn't make that cause almost a million jews go back to the homeland but it's what brother ben explained to us what the trumpets were for and the reason i show that is because if that's if that has something to do with it even if that's not all of it even if that has something to do with that that's under the third trumpet and brother branham said the sixth trumpet opened amen in world war ii right before world war ii the sixth trumpet opened but here you have this event taking place in 1986. so we've got to get out of our mind the idea of everything happens in chronological order god can do what he wants when he wants the way he wants to bring his children back home amen in whatever sequence needs to happen he knows the sequence he knows what each number means and he knows when it's going to take place all we have to do is say what brother brenham said is the truth that that sixth trumpet and sixth seal open at the same time [Music] does it mean more than that probably are there other applications yes but what he said was the truth right yes even mikhail gorbachev says that that chernobyl explosion was the likely reason it started the events that would collapse the ussr so that god so that the israelites the jews could go back to the homeland so that they could get back in time for the prophecy to be fulfilled of revelations 11 and call out the 144 000 now that's interesting but the real reason i went through that is for this that happened in my lifetime i saw it as a news article i saw him take sledgehammers when i was a boy and bash the berlin wall did you see that i heard about the collapse of ussr and i heard it was a good thing and the americans were happy i saw it as news i didn't realize it was god's plan i saw it as an event on the world stage i saw it as something that made the headlines made the papers i saw it as something that would be written in history books in the future i i saw it as history being taking place in my lifetime amen but i didn't realize that it was potentially prophecy being fulfilled and it was god gathering in regathering israel to the homeland so that he can so that he can blow the seventh trumpet what does that mean for you and i this is the important part because the entrepreneurs gather them back to the homeland back what's our homeland the word the open word and god will use events in our lives and to us they're just part of our history they're just an event that took place the plant shut down i lost my job i was in a car accident i had a family member die what what what if god are using events like that to drive us back to the homeland to bring us to the word amen to get us in a place where we come back to the word amen because what happens for the church what happens for israel also happens to you and i god also uses events amen he uses things that would become part of our story a catastrophe that happened around us things that that were odd things that that would make news and he uses them to bring i mean he uses them to bring israel back home but can he use those things to bring us to the word amen to drive us back to the homeland of his word to call us to the word brother abraham said in the church ages he said a seal would break a trumpet would sound and that trumpet was to gather the people to the word amen but that trumpet would cause a spiritual war and you say oh how horrible why would a trumpet cause a war why would we want a war i mean we just want the things of god to be sweet and peaceful no god used the war to force people to make a decision there's no more sitting on the fence there's no more waiting to see what will happen but god will bring a spiritual war to force the issue so that you couldn't stay in the catholic church and accept justification by faith it would start a war so that you had to make a choice and you had to move from one place to the other then you had to take a position on the issue he'll do the same thing to you and i he'll bring a war all around us amen trouble troublesome times troublesome things happening to get us off the fence and get us into motion to move to pick a side to move and take the word and get with the word [Music] and it looks like just a news event that was just that something happened and now there's no more ussr why is there no more ussr because brother branham 7 never said he never had his whole church stand up and say watch ussr watch ussr but he said stand up and now repeat after me watch russia watch russia watch the king of the north amen so that means when you come down to the very end of time there can't be a ussr there's got to be russia so god will blow up a reactor [Applause] why because the prophet said watch russia watch the king of the north and he's got to get his children he's got to get the jews back home so that they can receive those two prophets and we thought that was news that wasn't news that was prophecy being fulfilled that was god moving his people in the church we see the war amen between luther i mean the catholics and the lutherans between those who are saved by justification and those want to be saved by work war breaks out why because he's got to drive them to the word amen the elect have to get back home to the word why does he let trouble strike us because he's trying to move us back to the word why did laban's sons get so disgusted with jacob because jacob had to get back to the homeland because it was now time joseph was on the scene but we had to get we got to get back so so benjamin could come on the scene and so he would allow strife between laban's sons and jacob to make jacob uncomfortable so that jacob would want to go back home because jacob had to go back home to fulfill the word amen we've got to get all the way in possession of this land all of the word we have to be in possession and god is orchestrating news events all over the planet and now we watch the news and this war and this economic collapse and this catastrophe and this when i look at what happened at chernobyl now i wonder what's going on what's going on a worldwide pandemic a financial disaster looming a china and the south china sea i wonder what's happening i wonder what's going on i don't know i can't say i'm not a prophet i can't draw the conclusion but i know this that whatever is happening is happening according to god's program and god's moving his program forward and it may be a news article it may be a blip on your phone it may be a flashing latest news but that latest news may be the very thing that's jumping right out of the page of our bible and we're going to miss it just as easy we've missed the ones before and they've missed them all down through time we can miss them but we need to be tuned in not to try to interpret but be tuned into the fact that god is accomplishing his purpose on the earth and he's moving nations and he's moving peoples and he's moving armies to accomplish his purpose and what is his purpose his purpose is get the bride together for a rapture and get the jews together to receive the messiah so everything that's happening i can assure you is happening in line with that objective because he had one purpose one goal one thought that he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and that purpose and that thought is being achieved on this earth now and has everything to do with you and i it has everything to do with those 144 000 jews it's got everything to do with them and now it's not just news it's my life and it's affecting my life and instead of making me weary and instead of making me nervous amen i wanted to drive me to my homeland [Applause] amen the economy falls apart drive me to my homeland amen my work falls apart drive me to my homeland the nation crumbles around me drive me to my homeland let every trumpet sound drive me to my homeland to where our focus becomes the word and the word only that every solution to every problem is the word not a stimulus check and not a credit card and not a new job but my solution is the word because that was the point it wasn't to rebuild another reactor amen and it wasn't to put together the ussr again but the point was to bring forth the word praise be to god i don't know about you but something about that thrills my heart i don't know what else is there i don't know what else happened i don't know what the other trumpets are i don't even know if this is for sure the fulfillment of that trumpet all i can tell you is what i see and what i see is pretty amazing if that's only a part of it it's amazing it's amazing that god can do that something right out of his word he can do that to bring his children home and if he can do that listen just listen to me for a minute if he can collapse the ussr to get the jews to go back home what can he do to get us in position i mean now we're standing here in 2020 saying yeah the ussr collapse collapsed the ussr like it's no big deal but if you were alive in the early 80s if you lived in belarus or ukraine or you lived in poland it was a big deal there's no collapsing the usr ussr there's no stopping the empire but god could bring it down and he could orchestrate events that would take place you know in chernobyl in that reactor oh my goodness there was four reactors there was plans to build more guess which reactor blew up what seal are we under guess which reactor blew up number four well that's interesting too they were trying to do a safety test to prevent an explosion they knew that they had a risky situation if they lost power and they had to go to backup generators it was a few seconds with no power and they were trying to work their way through that to figure out how to keep the reactor alive so they knew they had a safety issue so they were running a safety test to prevent this nuclear meltdown and during the safety test to prevent a nuclear meltdown they had a nuclear meltdown trying to prevent a nuclear meltdown you look at the irony of god they're trying to prevent a nuclear meltdown and god allows that to be the sequence of events that would allow a nuclear meltdown because god needed a nuclear meltdown so even if you try to safeguard yourself against god working you into your position there is nothing you can do to safeguard yourself when god wants to accomplish something in our lives amen there's no safety net no hedge fund no investment is ever going to save us because if god wants it to collapse it will collapse not so that we can be punished so that he can get us back in our land back to the word if there's something keeping us back the boundary of the ussr the iron the iron curtain was keeping the jews from the homeland so god would collapse a nuclear reactor during a safety test to prevent a collapse of a nuclear reactor do you see how beautiful god is you see how perfect he is he can do whatever he wants and man can't stop him and you can't stop him and neither do we want to stop him i want to say god give me in my land god take away every barrier god take away every iron curtain that is keeping me from fully possessing my land break down the iron curtains in my mind amen so i quit looking at it through denominational eyes so i quit looking at it through intellect but by revelation rip that iron curtain open and let me see it the way your prophet saw it let me see it the way you showed it to him he said i may not be able to explain it in a way to make sense to you but i know exactly what i'm talking about and i say god give me that same vision that same revelation you gave him so that i'll know what he's talking about rip the iron curtain away from my mind lord set me free from human intellect set me free from denominational teaching on the bible set me free from my own conclusions that i've drawn and break the iron curtain away from me and if you gotta melt down this reactor in my heart melt it down and let me go free what has held us back denominational thinking has been the thing that has held us back the most but the ego wants to fly i want to fly i don't want to misplace the word i don't want to misinterpret the word but i want to believe exactly what brother benham said and i don't want to keep skimming over what he said and say well i don't understand that and just keep looking elsewhere for good quotes i want god to show it to me i wanted full possession of my land if brother bennett preached speech to trump's and feast the trumpets is for me if he preached future home future homes for me whatever he preached if he preached crisis and mr god revealed christ as the mystery god reveals for me if he came and opened the book of revelation the book of revelation is for me [Music] and i don't want the old iron curtain in my mind to keep me back from my land well this happens over here and this happens over the tribulation period and this happens here just let brother branham say what he said and let it be true and say god how is it that the trumpets are in between the six and seventh file how is it show me how the sixth seal and the sixth trumpet opened at the same time instead of explaining it away why don't you just show it to me lord show it to me take the old denominational nuclear power reactor and melt it down blow it up burn it down the old i pigeonholed this scripture here and i pigeonholed this scripture here and i pigeonholed this scripture here what is that denominational thinking lord melt that thing down help me to quit trying to save my old understanding through a safety test just let me read the message with revelation just give me eyes to see in a heart to perceive lord let me walk in the light as you're in the light and lord as you reveal more let me walk in that and let me stick with it and let me stay with it and keep walking in it and let me see your word unfold itself if the prophet preached it it's for us it may not be for me today but it's for me it might be for me next week but i'm going to stick with it till next week comes because it's for me and i want to stay with it until he opens the word i want god to break the iron curtain from me and let me go free and if it involves a meltdown then let it melt down if it involves the collapse of the nation let the nation collapse but keep me in your land keep me in your word man let's all stand i hope you understand my heart what i'm trying to say and please don't make me say something i didn't mean to say see how perfect the word of god is all history is revolving around this word the babylonian kingdom moving into the kingdom of the medes of the persians moving in the kingdom of greece moving into rome where do you find that here rome splitting into an eastern and western kingdom why did they split well because in the byzantine empire and there was a that's not why they split they split because daniel saw it split you see we read our history books and this is the reason the ussr came down this is the reason the roman empire split in the eastern western this is the reason that's not the reason that's not the reason those are just the events god used the reason was daniel saw it that way and that's the way it had to be what's the reason the reason is it's already written here and before it was written here it was in god's mind it was a finished work from before the foundation of the world that's why the usr collapsed that's why amen there was a holocaust that's why 200 000 000 demons came out into the armies of hitler muslin stalin that's why there was a world war ii that's why europe was almost completely taken over by hitler's army why because hitler was such a good strategist no because it was in the word it was already in the scriptures and and when those demons came out they went into those armies what were they trying to do what was hitler trying to do hitler was trying to bring the third right what was the third right the third empire what third empire what was the first empire the roman empire what was the second empire the holy roman empire and he was trying to bring the third empire he i mean he declared it openly it wasn't hiding what made him want to do that amen there was demon powers anointing him because it was written in the word and he's trying to bring back the roman empire and brother brenham said those old roman spirits look how they persecuted the jews and you say that wasn't rome that was germany and that was italy and that was russia no he says no it's the same spirit look they did the same thing and even testified of it being the same spirit because he wanted to bring in the third right the third empire amen why did he do that why why was hitler so demon possessed why did he have such a hatred for the jews why did he have i mean why did they have such technological advances to conquer the world to rid it of all jews why why why why because he was falling right in line under the seals he was catching the same inspiration he became a preview of the beast when the when the antichrist would fully incarnate the pope and what was he he's in the same vein in the same sequence of events in the same revolving history of prophecy amen only not in full measure yet he wasn't the full incarnation because no we know that'll be in the pope brother venom said so but he was foreshadowing what would come why because the prophecy is already in the book and it's unfolding in a revolving history why did rome hate the jews same reason praise god friends everything in our history revolves around this book right here and what was it all doing all of history the wars and this and that what was it doing it was moving god's program forward and what's it doing today moving god's program forward and guess what i'm part of his program everything around me is trying to what move me which is part of his program forward not shut me down not hurt me not destroy me not depress me but everything around me is trying to move his program forward and i say god let me move forward let's bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord for this word god i pray that you would just lord fix all the broken pieces lord as it comes out i pray that you'd piece it together the way you want it lord i pray that you'd bless your people to receive your word that we can walk lord in line with your word and obedience to your word watching it unfold itself lord we thank you for the revelation of the word lord and how it lifts us higher lord and how we can see like we've never seen before and we're praying god that you would just let us see the way you reveal it to your prophet lord that we can see what he was seeing lord that we can see this book unveiled the way he saw it unveiled show us every mystery show us every type lord show us our place and show us what you're doing in our lives right now lord so that we can get with the program show us how you're moving us forward how you're trying to line us to the word bring us into the land show us lord let every circumstance lord move your kingdom forward help us to stop fighting lord or complaining but help us to get with the program and move forward with your program god you're for us you're never against us all these things have to be this way because you're using the trumpets to draw us into the land you're using even strife to get us to make a decision everything is good lord and everything's for your program bless your people lord god drive revelation into our hearts let this not be about information or news articles or even events in history but lord let it be about you your word the unfolding of your mystery lord calling to your bride whispering love secrets to her lord god let it be more than the information but let it be the life god coming through we love you lord jesus we ask
