[3:21] When the [singing] wicked, even mine
[3:24] enies
[3:26] and my foes [singing]
[3:30] came upon me to eat up my flesh.
[3:35] Oh, they stumbled and [singing] fell.
[3:40] [clears throat] Yes, they stumbled and
[3:42] fell.
[3:44] No one host should encamp against
[3:46] [singing] me.
[3:48] My heart shall not fear.
[3:52] The war should rise [singing] against
[3:54] me. In this will I be confident.
[4:00] One thing have I [singing]
[4:02] desired,
[4:04] and that will I seek, that I may dwell
[4:09] in the house of the Lord [singing]
[4:12] all the days of my life,
[4:16] to behold [singing] the beauty of the
[4:19] Lord, and to inquire in [singing] his
[4:23] temple.
[4:25] For in the time of trouble, he shall
[4:28] hide me. He shall hide me in his
[4:33] pavilion,
[4:35] in the secret of his tabernacle.
[4:39] [singing]
[4:40] He shall set me upon a rock.
[4:44] Yes, he has hid [singing] me. He has hid
[4:48] me in his pavilion. [singing]
[4:52] In the secret of his tabernacle,
[4:56] [singing]
[4:58] he has set me. Yes, he has set me upon
[5:02] [singing] a rock.
[5:05] And now shall my head be lifted up above
[5:10] my enemies [singing]
[5:12] there all around me. Yet I will sing.
[5:18] I'll bring the sacrifice of praise to
[5:22] the house [singing]
[5:23] of the Lord and I will sing.
[5:26] Yes, I will [singing] sing
[5:30] praises to my king.
[5:34] So [singing] wait on the Lord and be of
[5:38] good courage and he shall strengthen
[5:42] your heart.
[5:44] Wait on the Lord and don't be
[5:47] discouraged
[5:49] for he hath taken your part.

[13:40] Praise the Lord. Let's bow our heads
[13:42] together this morning.
[13:45] Lord Jesus, [music] we thank you,
[13:46] Father, for bringing us together once
[13:49] again. For, Father, it's your drawing
[13:52] power that brings [music] us to
[13:53] yourself. We're so thankful, Lord, that
[13:57] you have called and we have responded.
[14:00] And Lord, we want you to have your way
[14:02] amongst us now, Lord, [music] as we've
[14:05] sung the song, may it become a living
[14:07] reality. May you come on the scene,
[14:09] Lord, and may you have your way in each
[14:12] of our lives. May you use the the the
[14:15] word, Lord, to direct us, to shape us,
[14:17] Lord, to to carve the stone out into the
[14:20] shape that you predestinated us for us
[14:22] to be in, Lord, that you might magnify
[14:24] yourself and be glorified in this
[14:26] [music] place today and be glorified and
[14:28] magnified in our lives, Lord, as we
[14:31] [music] leave this place. We love you.
[14:33] We ask, God, that you would take this
[14:35] vessel of mine under your control and
[14:37] may you use it for your glory as I
[14:39] [music] surrender to your hand. And may
[14:41] you give us all ears to hear and a heart
[14:44] to perceive all that you have for us to
[14:46] this this day. [music]
[14:47] For God, we feel privileged to be here,
[14:50] to hear your word preach, to sing the
[14:52] songs of Zion. God, we thank you that we
[14:56] ask you would take preeminence among us,
[14:58] Lord, and have [music] your way. In
[15:00] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[15:05] Amen. It's good to be here. Amen. I I
[15:09] trust 2026 has been treating you good so
[15:11] far. And if it hasn't, don't tell me. I
[15:14] just want to hear good news. Amen. Let's
[15:16] just stay positive. Praise the Lord.
[15:18] Amen. It's good to be together this
[15:19] Sunday, the first Sunday of 2026. Amen.
[15:23] I just um want to remind you that there
[15:25] will be no communion or feet washing
[15:27] today. We usually do it the first Sunday
[15:29] of the month, but because of the watch
[15:30] night service on Wednesday, we have
[15:32] communion and so there won't be today.
[15:34] And I just want to say how much I
[15:35] enjoyed the watch night service. That
[15:37] was such a blessing. I enjoyed, you
[15:39] know, everybody's contribution, the
[15:41] songs, the rejoicing, the testimonies.
[15:44] It was quite a blessing. Amen. So, we
[15:46] thank God for that. Also, I appreciate
[15:48] sister Susan, your testimony. That was a
[15:50] real blessing. And uh thank you, brother
[15:52] Gabe, for sharing that testimony,
[15:54] brother Wooley. It's so encouraging to
[15:56] see that he's the same yesterday, today.
[15:58] And for we believe it, but every time it
[16:00] manifests, it thrills our souls. Amen.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; So, God is good. And while we're
[16:05] standing, if you could turn with me to
[16:06] the book of Isaiah, and we'll go to
[16:08] Isaiah chapter 7.
[16:11] Amen. It's good to see Brother Randy and
[16:13] Sister Anna Lungsford with us. And thank
[16:15] you for the song, Sister Anna. We
[16:17] appreciate it very much. It's always
[16:18] good to have you visiting. Amen. We have
[16:20] a few other visitors here. We have the
[16:23] Take family visiting. Sister Melody,
[16:25] Sister Beth, and Brother Michael back
[16:26] here. God bless you. It's good to have
[16:28] you here with us. Amen. And many of you
[16:30] will know Brother Chris T who's
[16:32] ministered several times. These are his
[16:34] siblings here. I'm sorry you have to be
[16:36] known by association, but but we love
[16:39] brother Chris, so I'm it's good for us.
[16:41] Amen. Uh but sister Melody has felt led
[16:44] of the Lord to move here. She's moved to
[16:46] Lima. She's moving this uh tomorrow, I
[16:48] believe, and uh going to be joining the
[16:50] assembly and fellowship. So, we want to
[16:52] welcome her as well. So, God bless you
[16:54] very much. Amen. Praise the Lord. God is
[16:58] good. Any other visitors we have, we're
[17:00] glad you're with us. Amen. And hope that
[17:01] you feel very welcome. and just rejoice
[17:04] in the Lord with us. Amen. Isaiah 7:14.
[17:09] I'm going to go back to uh the service I
[17:11] preached uh uh I think it was before
[17:15] Christmas, but I don't remember now. And
[17:17] I started with this scripture. And so
[17:19] I'm I'm going to continue on with that
[17:21] thought. Says in uh Isaiah 7:14,
[17:25] "Therefore the Lord himself shall give
[17:27] you a sign. And behold, a virgin shall
[17:30] conceive and bear a son, and shall call
[17:33] his name Emmanuel.
[17:35] Now, if you could turn with me to the
[17:37] book of Matthew
[17:44] and Matthew chapter 1.
[17:51] Matthew chapter 1 and verse 19
[17:57] verse 18 sorry verse 18 now the birth of
[18:00] Jesus Christ was on this wise when as
[18:02] his mother Mary was a spouse to Joseph
[18:04] before they came together she was found
[18:06] with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph
[18:09] her husband being a just man and not
[18:11] willing to make her a public example was
[18:13] minded to put her away privately but
[18:16] while he thought on these things behold
[18:18] the angel of the Lord appeared unto him
[18:19] in a dream saying Joseph Joseph, thou
[18:21] son of David. Fear not to take unto thee
[18:23] Mary thy wife. For that which is
[18:26] conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost,
[18:29] and she shall bring forth a son, and
[18:31] thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he
[18:33] shall save his people from their sins.
[18:36] Now all this was done that it might be
[18:38] fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord
[18:40] by the prophet saying behold a virgin
[18:43] shall be with child and shall bring
[18:44] forth a son and they shall call his name
[18:47] Emanuel which being interpreted is God
[18:50] with us. Amen. God bless you as you take
[18:53] your seats. Amen. May the Lord's
[18:56] blessing be upon us as we look into his
[18:58] word. Amen.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; Without his blessing, we just are
[19:01] reading.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we need his blessing and we
[19:04] need the divine revelation from the
[19:06] father. Amen. To to open to us the
[19:08] scriptures and to open our understanding
[19:10] to understand the scriptures. Now that
[19:14] service previously that I'm referring to
[19:15] a couple services back, amen. I preached
[19:18] on the subject Emmanuel and how God was
[19:21] with us and he took on a form of flesh
[19:23] and became our brother. And it was God,
[19:26] amen, making his own body to live and
[19:28] reflecting himself in human flesh. And
[19:31] he was God with us. Amen. And so it was
[19:34] a blessing to me the thought and I
[19:35] appreciated it. And at that time I had
[19:38] some more that I wanted to minister on
[19:39] that, but uh I I was going to maybe
[19:42] bring it Sunday, but then by before we
[19:44] got to Sunday, the subject of the bitter
[19:46] waters made sweet was burning me up and
[19:48] I couldn't. I had to preach that. And
[19:50] then we come to watch night and I had a
[19:52] different thought for watch night. But
[19:54] then after watch night, all of a sudden
[19:55] the inspiration came back and I'm going
[19:57] to go back. So if we could pull up the
[19:58] PowerPoint, uh if we could bring that
[20:00] up. I want to preach on he is still
[20:02] Emanuel.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; He is still Emanuel. Amen. And we want
[20:06] to look at things related to the day and
[20:08] age that we're living in. Amen. Because
[20:11] that's the revelation of the hour that
[20:12] that gives us life. It's the revelation
[20:14] of the hour, Amen, that gives us
[20:16] instruction. It's the revelation of the
[20:18] hour, Amen, that quickens the seed on
[20:20] the inside.
[20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. It It's amazing to me how brother
[20:25] Brandon began to teach us this concept,
[20:27] Amen. Amen. And he began to share with
[20:29] us, amen, that it's the light of the
[20:31] age, amen, that quickens the seed. It's
[20:33] the water for that age, amen, that's
[20:35] made to quicken the seed for that age.
[20:37] And and and praise God, God sent us a
[20:40] prophet in this day to fulfill to
[20:42] fulfill the scriptures, to fulfill the
[20:44] prophecy. Amen. that he would peel back
[20:46] the scriptures and bring a revelation of
[20:48] the word, a light, a bright and shining
[20:51] light because there was going to be seed
[20:53] on the earth at that time that needed a
[20:55] certain water of the word and a certain
[20:57] dispensational light so that they could
[20:59] come to life and that was you and I.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; And God would make sure the light was
[21:04] here and the water was here when you and
[21:05] I were here. Amen. Because that was what
[21:07] was necessary to bring us to life.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we I [laughter] absolutely
[21:12] love the message of the hour. It is
[21:14] Christ.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; It is life. Listen, it's not books and
[21:19] tapes. It's not print on paper. It's not
[21:21] recorded sermons. It is none other than
[21:24] Jesus Christ speaking love secrets to
[21:27] his spouse, to his bride, to his wife.
[21:29] It's him unveiling himself to her. And
[21:31] listen, this message isn't for
[21:33] everybody. Amen. And we don't say that
[21:35] arrogantly. We don't say that in
[21:37] condemnation because if it's not for
[21:38] everybody, it's the other people's, you
[21:41] know, it's not for them. and they don't
[21:43] have eyes to see and ears to hear.
[21:45] That's okay.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; That's all right.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. God has a plan for those
[21:49] individuals as well. God has a way,
[21:52] amen, for them also. There can be
[21:54] salvation. Amen. Because God is so good.
[21:56] Because the blood of Jesus Christ
[21:58] purchased all creation. And he's the
[22:00] Lord of Lords and King of Kings. When he
[22:02] sits on the throne, he can give life to
[22:04] who he wants and allow entrance into the
[22:06] kingdom to whosoever he will because he
[22:08] now is the ruler and owner. Amen. and
[22:11] dispenser of all life. He can at the
[22:13] white throne judgment pardon and grant
[22:15] mercy and he will.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful for that. Amen. So God
[22:20] has a way. Amen. For the peoples of the
[22:22] earth. If they can respect God's people,
[22:24] THEY RESPECT GOD'S WAY and respect God's
[22:26] word. God has a way.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; But the message of the hour, Amen, is
[22:32] for the elect bride of Jesus Christ.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:35] &gt;&gt; And she has ears to hear. Amen. And it's
[22:37] the very thing that gives her life. It's
[22:39] the very thing that gives her vision.
[22:40] It's the very thing that sets her feet
[22:42] on the right path. AMEN. AND WITHOUT
[22:44] THAT, we're wandering in the wilderness.
[22:46] It takes the message and nothing but the
[22:48] message.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; Right.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; And so, I'm thankful for it. I'm
[22:52] thankful God gave it to us.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; It is Christ to me.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; It's not another way of believing.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; It's the only way of believing.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; Right.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; And I don't mean that derogatory because
[23:05] I I just I hope I just explained myself.
[23:07] But for the elect, it's the only way of
[23:10] believing. It's the path to life. It's
[23:12] the truth. It's the way. It's Jesus
[23:14] Christ in our day unveiling himself to
[23:17] us.
[23:18] &gt;&gt; So I love it with a love that's beyond
[23:20] human. I I have a passion for with a
[23:22] passion that's beyond me.
[23:26] &gt;&gt; Man, it's [clears throat] gone.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; And so I want to look at this subject of
[23:30] he is still Emanuel. And I just pray
[23:33] that God will just anoint Amen. bring an
[23:36] anointing to anoint the gift that's in
[23:38] me so I can get out of the way so that
[23:39] he can minister because I'll tell you
[23:41] right now, I've got too much material
[23:43] and too many quotes and too many
[23:44] scripture, too many things. Amen. But
[23:47] praise God, I don't know. I have still
[23:49] not figured out how to do this. All I
[23:50] know how to do is come and stand here.
[23:52] Amen. With what God's laid on my heart
[23:54] and trust that God will work through the
[23:56] body to pull on the gift and his spirit
[23:58] will bring the word. Amen.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; So, we're dependent upon each other
[24:02] today.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. In Colossians 2:9, he says, "For
[24:07] in him dwelleth all the fullness of the
[24:09] Godhead bodily, that was in Jesus
[24:11] Christ, God had poured himself, amen, in
[24:14] a full measure, his full life, and he
[24:16] was the fullness of the Godhead in one
[24:18] body,
[24:19] &gt;&gt; the body of Jesus Christ."
[24:22] But in testimony upon the sea, the
[24:24] prophet says, "All that God was, he
[24:26] poured into Christ. He was the fullness
[24:29] of the Godhead bodily. And all that
[24:31] Christ was, he poured into his church.
[24:34] That day you'll know that I'm in the
[24:36] Father, the Father in me, I in you, and
[24:39] you in me. See, it's God. It was God
[24:42] above us. It was God with us and God in
[24:45] us. See what I mean? There it is. The
[24:48] same God. And brother Bam talks about
[24:50] this in many, many places. And he said
[24:53] in the in the days of the Old Testament
[24:55] when Israel, Amen, was moving and
[24:57] progressing in their journey, amen, he
[24:59] was God above them. He was the pillar of
[25:01] fire. He He was uh the cloud by day and
[25:04] the fire by night. He was the shakina of
[25:06] glory that went in behind the veil. It
[25:08] was God above them. Amen. But when he
[25:10] came and became Jesus Christ, it was God
[25:13] with us. A brethren, a a God in flesh
[25:16] like we are in flesh. It was God with
[25:18] us. Amen. But then the dispensation
[25:20] after that became God in us.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I know my title is God is still
[25:27] Emanuel, which means God with us. But I
[25:29] hope you'll just bear with me and we'll
[25:30] get to that in just a minute. He is in
[25:33] us, but he's in us and with us.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Here's what he said in Matthew 28. Go ye
[25:40] therefore and teach all nations,
[25:41] baptizing, baptizing them in the name of
[25:43] Father and Son and Holy Ghost, teaching
[25:46] them to observe all things whatsoever
[25:47] I've commanded you. And lo, I am with
[25:50] you always,
[25:52] &gt;&gt; even into the end of the world.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; He's promised to still be with his
[25:57] disciples. He was departing. Amen. But
[25:59] he was going to come again. And he said,
[26:01] "I am with you always." He is still God
[26:04] with us.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Even to the end of the world. How is
[26:08] that God with us? He's in us.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; In Hebrews 13:5, he says, "Let your
[26:14] conversation be without covetness, and
[26:16] be content with such things as you have,
[26:17] for he saith, I will never leave thee,
[26:20] nor forsake thee."
[26:22] &gt;&gt; Let's turn to John 14 together and read
[26:25] this scripture together.
[26:30] I'm going to move quickly through this
[26:32] first section of scriptures and quotes
[26:34] and and it's laying again a foundation
[26:36] and bringing us all to the same page,
[26:38] the same thinking so I can move to the
[26:39] next step.
[26:44] And we look at John 14:1 18
[26:48] says, "I will not leave you comfortless.
[26:52] I will come to you."
[26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; I love that. I will not leave you
[26:58] comfortless. I will come. Who's
[27:00] speaking? Jesus Christ. I will come to
[27:02] you.
[27:04] Yet a little while and the world seeth
[27:06] me no more, but ye see me because I
[27:08] live, ye shall live also. At that day
[27:12] you shall know that I am in my father
[27:14] and ye in me and I in you.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Brother Bam said,
[27:20] making them all one.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he takes this scripture and
[27:24] uses it many times when he said, "All
[27:26] that God was, he poured into Christ. And
[27:28] all that Christ was, he poured into the
[27:30] church." Now, let's skip down to verse
[27:32] 23. Jesus answered and said unto him,
[27:35] "If a man loved me, he will keep my
[27:38] words, and my father will love him, and
[27:40] we will come unto him and make our abode
[27:43] with him." Who's the we? The father and
[27:46] the son. Amen. He said we. There's a
[27:50] fullness that's coming back again. Yes.
[27:52] Amen.
[27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's look at this in the in the
[27:56] quotes and in the scriptures. Notice
[27:58] then [clears throat and cough]
[27:59] then we become part of him as you are
[28:02] the veil that veils him. You are part of
[28:05] him as long as Christ is in you as
[28:06] Christ was of God. Because God was in
[28:09] him made him God. And as Christ is in
[28:11] you the hope of glory. You become part
[28:14] of Christ. He that believeth on me the
[28:16] works that I do shall he also see. You
[28:19] become part of Christ as long as Christ
[28:20] is hid in you. Then it's veiled to the
[28:23] unbeliever. But you know he's in you.
[28:26] You are templing Christ that's behind
[28:28] the veil the skin. Then be behind
[28:31] because of this veil the veil again in
[28:34] human flesh hides God the word from the
[28:37] unbeliever. So where is he? Amen. He
[28:40] went into the people. He went into the
[28:42] believer and he's behind the veil. What
[28:45] veil? Human flesh veil.
[28:47] But it's God. It's the same one that
[28:49] said, "I will not leave you comfortless,
[28:50] but I will come to you." Amen. My
[28:53] father, if you keep my words, my father
[28:54] will love you and and we will come into
[28:57] you.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; And make our abode with you. Amen.
[29:01] You'll be the dwelling place. Amen. For
[29:03] the life of God.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the veil again in human flesh
[29:08] hides God the word from the unbeliever.
[29:12] He says uh in 1 Corinthians, "Know you
[29:14] not that you are the temple of God and
[29:17] that the spirit of God dwelleth in you."
[29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; And Colossians 1 says, "Even the mystery
[29:23] which has been hid from ages and from
[29:25] generations, but now is made manifest to
[29:27] his saints, to whom God would make known
[29:30] what is the riches of the glory of this
[29:32] mystery among the Gentiles, which is
[29:34] Christ in you, the hope of glory."
[29:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I think we're seeing the
[29:39] picture. Where is the temple? Where is
[29:40] the veil? Where is the tabernacle? Where
[29:42] is his tent? Amen. Where is he hiding?
[29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; Christ in you.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; That's the mystery among the Gentiles.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother B says, "Now God over us,
[29:54] God with us, now God in us. All that God
[29:58] was, he poured into Christ. All that
[30:00] Christ was, he poured into the church.
[30:02] At that day, you'll know that I'm in the
[30:04] Father, the Father in me, I in you and
[30:06] you in me." So it's been God all along.
[30:08] You see his same works. The church is
[30:11] ordained to carry on the work with the
[30:14] same spirit. So it's the same life, the
[30:17] same spirit, the same God. Amen. That
[30:20] was in Christ. The same Christ that's
[30:21] now in us. Amen. Continuing on his work
[30:25] because he's veiled behind human flesh.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; He was veiled behind the flesh of Jesus
[30:31] Christ. But now he's veiled behind the
[30:33] flesh of a many membered body.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; Keep looking at this.
[30:39] God was bottled and confined in one man,
[30:42] Jesus Christ, but now he's bottled and
[30:46] confined in the whole universal church
[30:48] of the living God.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; So where is he?
[30:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what brother Bam is
[30:55] saying. GOD WHEN HE GOD POURED HIMSELF
[30:58] into Christ. Amen. He poured his whole
[31:00] life into Christ. And now God was
[31:02] bottled and confined. Amen. In one man,
[31:06] Jesus Christ. And now, brother Benham's
[31:08] telling us, amen, that that same life
[31:10] has been poured out once again and come
[31:12] into THE CHURCH. AND NOW HE'S BOTTLED
[31:15] AND confined in the whole universal
[31:18] church of the living God. So it's not
[31:20] you that has all of Christ, BUT ALL OF
[31:22] CHRIST HAS COME BACK INTO A BODY.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Not me as an individual. I don't have it
[31:28] all. AMEN. BUT GOD HAS A BODY that he
[31:31] has POURED HIS LIFE INTO in this end
[31:33] time
[31:35] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S ON EARTH.
[31:38] Praise God. Ephesians chapter 1, he
[31:41] says, "Which he wrought in Christ when
[31:43] he raised him from the dead and set him
[31:45] on his own right hand in the heavenly
[31:47] places, far above all principality and
[31:50] power and might and dominion, and every
[31:52] name that is named, not only in this
[31:54] world, but also in that which is to
[31:56] come. and he hath put all things under
[31:58] his feet, and give him to be the head
[32:00] over all things to the church, which is
[32:03] his body, the fullness of him that
[32:05] filleth all in all. I broke this down
[32:08] before, but I'm going to break it down
[32:10] again today because brother Brandham is
[32:13] a scriptural prophet. There's nothing
[32:14] that he's saying that doesn't come from
[32:16] the Bible. When he said, "All that God
[32:18] was, he poured into Christ." Amen.
[32:20] That's in the scripture. He was the
[32:21] fullness of the Godhead bodily. And when
[32:23] he says all that Christ was, he poured
[32:25] into the church, that's also a
[32:26] scriptural statement. Even though he's
[32:28] not quoting verbatim the scripture, he's
[32:30] quoting the scripture.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; CUZ HE'S A SCRIPTURAL PROPHET. EVERY
[32:35] CONCEPT HE TEACHES, every doctrine HE
[32:37] TEACHES IS THE BIBLE.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand's not making stuff up.
[32:41] AMEN. HE'S JUST EXPRESSING HIS
[32:44] REVELATION OF THE word and the WAY THAT
[32:46] HE EXPRESSES IT. AMEN.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; So he made he gave him Christ to be head
[32:53] over all things to the church.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; Which is his body. What's his body? The
[33:01] church.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; The fullness.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; What's the fullness of him that filth
[33:09] all in all? The fullness is the body,
[33:12] &gt;&gt; which is the church. Amen.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; This is where brother Brandham gets his
[33:16] teaching.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; FROM PAUL. HE SAID WHEN HE WENT BEYOND
[33:20] THE CURTAIN OF TIME, HE TAUGHT WHAT PAUL
[33:22] TAUGHT.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; It's exactly where this comes from.
[33:26] Amen. This isn't this isn't new to the
[33:28] message. Amen. This has been in
[33:30] Christianom from the very beginning.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; This is what God wanted at the very
[33:34] beginning. THIS IS WHY, AMEN. HE SENT
[33:36] THE Holy Ghost in THE BEGINNING. THAT'S
[33:38] WHY THERE WAS A DAY OF PENTECOST. THAT'S
[33:40] WHY HE SHED HIS BLOOD. THIS IS WHAT HE'S
[33:42] ALWAYS WANTED TO DO. THIS has been his
[33:44] plan since before the foundation of the
[33:45] world.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; It's not a new concept.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; He says, "What's his purpose now?
[33:52] Express himself as a son." See, and now
[33:55] that in him might dwell the fullness of
[33:57] the Godhead bodily, I'll give I've got
[33:59] Colossians laying here right before me.
[34:01] See that? All through the scripture,
[34:03] that's what God's purpose was. Then
[34:05] through this life of his son, his cross,
[34:08] the blood says here of his cross, that
[34:11] he might reconcile to himself a body, a
[34:14] bride which is Eve, the second Eve. So
[34:17] he came and through the shedding of his
[34:19] blood, HE RECONCILED BACK A BODY, AMEN,
[34:22] A BRIDE, AMEN, so that he could get he
[34:24] could cross over, amen, the sin barrier
[34:27] and move into his people because there
[34:29] had to be an atonement made for sin, a
[34:32] price paid for the washing away of sin
[34:34] so that he could bridge the gap and come
[34:36] back into fellowship in humanity.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; And and Christ is the mystery again. He
[34:42] says, "Now see the whole three-fold
[34:44] purpose. See, to express himself. So, I
[34:47] want you to get this. The whole
[34:49] three-fold purpose is to EXPRESS
[34:51] HIMSELF. GOD'S EXPRESSING HIMSELF. GOD'S
[34:54] DISPLAYING his attributes. God's
[34:56] bringing himself into manifestation to
[34:58] be seen, to become tangible, to be
[35:00] understood. And he did it with a
[35:02] three-fold purpose. His original plan
[35:04] was in Eden. And he showed there what
[35:06] his masterpiece was, a masterpiece
[35:08] family, a man and a a son of God and his
[35:11] bride ruling over the earth. And he gave
[35:14] us the snapshot, the picture. And then
[35:16] Satan came in and ruined it. And it
[35:17] fell. The masterpiece fell into ruin.
[35:19] But he began again rebuilding the
[35:21] masterpiece. And to do it, he's got to
[35:23] bring back the last Adam. He did that in
[35:25] Christ Jesus. But the masterpiece isn't
[35:27] finished till it's a masterpiece family.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; So from Christ came the elements, the
[35:32] the the life and the blood, the word,
[35:34] and the life. Amen. To build a bride.
[35:36] And at the end time, at the end of the
[35:39] seven dispensations of the church age,
[35:41] HE'S BRINGING THEM BACK INTO unity
[35:43] again.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:48] Amen. We realize that this is what God
[35:51] was pouring himself out into the church
[35:53] on the day of Pentecost when the logos
[35:55] came into the room as a rushing mighty
[35:57] wind and the pillar of fire broke up,
[35:59] amen, into 120 licks of fire, amen, and
[36:02] he went into the people and and the and
[36:04] the visible display was the fire over
[36:06] their heads. They began to speak in
[36:07] tongues. They spilled out of the upper
[36:09] room. Amen. And what were they doing
[36:10] when they come out? They were telling
[36:12] people, "This is that." Amen. Peter was
[36:14] saying, "This is that WHICH WHICH THE
[36:16] PROPHET JOEL SAID, THIS IS THE HOUR.
[36:18] This is the dispensation. This is the
[36:20] time we've been waiting for."
[36:23] &gt;&gt; They were given a life. Amen. The life
[36:25] of Christ to boldly proclaim the truth.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they were given the revelation
[36:30] of the truth.
[36:33] But that was a that was a a a Jewish
[36:37] dispensation. Everybody in the upper
[36:38] room were Jews.
[36:40] But God wanted a gentile bride.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he began to move, Amen. from
[36:46] the Jews, from from this new birth
[36:48] experience into this and to his the
[36:50] quickening power of sons and daughters
[36:52] of God being brought to life by the
[36:54] power of of the Holy Ghost. He began to
[36:56] move out and branch out and in Antioch
[36:58] and in different places he began to
[37:00] branch out to the Gentiles until finally
[37:02] he sent Paul and Barnabas. Amen. And
[37:04] Paul went out with a commission to be a
[37:06] light unto the Gentiles.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; And when he gets to a place where the
[37:10] Jews now are rejecting the gospel, he
[37:12] says it was expedient that it should
[37:14] first be preached unto you. Amen. But
[37:16] seeing that you count yourselves
[37:18] unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we
[37:20] turn to the Gentiles. Because from
[37:22] before the foundation of the world, he
[37:24] was going to take a bride from the
[37:26] Gentiles.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; HE SHOWED IT IN TYPES AND SHADOWS all
[37:29] through the Old Testament. But he's
[37:31] going to take a bride from the Gentiles.
[37:33] So all of this has to transpire. So he
[37:35] begins TO CALL A BRIDE OUT OF THE
[37:37] GENTILES. AMEN. And Paul is THE
[37:39] MESSENGER, THE APOSTLE TO THE GENTILES.
[37:41] He is the light to the Gentiles. He's
[37:43] there bringing the truth, amen, of of
[37:45] grace to the Gentiles and they're being
[37:48] called out and they're coming. AMEN. BUT
[37:50] BEFORE HE could come to the marriage,
[37:52] amen, she had already fallen away by
[37:55] moving away from the teachings and uh
[37:57] doctrines of the apostles and started
[37:58] taking men's ideas and mixing it in. And
[38:01] she was already a fallen woman before he
[38:03] ever got to her.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; And that started, Amen. the church ages.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Did he know it was going to happen? Yes,
[38:13] &gt;&gt; because he had a seven sealed book from
[38:14] before the foundation of the world
[38:16] &gt;&gt; that contained the whole mystery of it.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; But it didn't change his mind. It didn't
[38:23] stop what he wanted. He still wanted a
[38:25] gentile bride. And he wanted her to come
[38:27] back to that full measure of his life
[38:30] like he had poured out at Pentecost.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; And that's why he sent a prophet. And
[38:37] that's why he opened the seals. And
[38:39] that's why he's done what he's done is
[38:41] so that he can get his life back into
[38:43] his gentile bride in fullness.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Rem said they had a dip in the
[38:48] spirit in Luther's day. They had a dip
[38:50] in the spirit in Wesley's day. They had
[38:52] a dip in Pentecost. But that's not what
[38:53] he wants. He wants to pour himself out
[38:55] again.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Into a body to have preeminence.
[39:01] And what's he doing? Expressing himself.
[39:05] Now the world is lost. Now he has to
[39:08] express himself in a man to become a
[39:10] savior through the reconciliation of
[39:12] blood from the cross. Now he had to
[39:15] become that to die in order to save and
[39:18] to bring himself back into the church to
[39:20] have preeminence in his church. So he
[39:23] did that so he could get back into
[39:25] people back into that fellowship and
[39:27] that way he could express himself.
[39:30] Amen. Brother goes on to say, "All that
[39:32] God was, he poured into Christ because
[39:35] he emptied himself and poured it into
[39:37] Christ. And Christ was the fullness of
[39:39] the Godhead bodily. All that Jehovah
[39:41] was, he poured into Christ. And all that
[39:44] Christ was, he poured into the church.
[39:46] Not into one individual, but into the
[39:48] entire body. There we come together in
[39:52] unity, we have power."
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what I want to talk about
[39:56] here for just a minute.
[39:58] He poured it not not into the
[40:01] individual,
[40:03] &gt;&gt; but into the entire body,
[40:06] &gt;&gt; that means you and I don't have a corner
[40:07] on all of it.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; Neither's one person or one family or
[40:13] one assembly of believers. Amen. It's a
[40:16] universal. The entire body, he's poured
[40:18] himself out into that. And praise God.
[40:20] That's why we can't run off into
[40:22] isolation and just say, "I've got it and
[40:24] I'm going to do it and just me and my
[40:26] household, we're going to sit at home
[40:27] and we're we're going to do this and
[40:29] amen." Listen, you can't you can't get
[40:31] his fullness that way. You need your
[40:33] brothers and sisters because God's given
[40:35] us a portion, a measure, and we need one
[40:38] another.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:42] We we He's He's poured HIMSELF OUT IN
[40:45] FULLNESS. ABSOLUTELY. We come to the day
[40:47] where the the seals have been removed.
[40:49] The barrier IS GONE. HE'S BACK AND
[40:52] FULLNESS BACK IN his church. Amen. But
[40:54] it's the entire body. And that's WHY WE
[40:56] CAN'T CUT PORTIONS off and cut
[40:58] fellowship out and refuse to have
[41:00] fellowship with people and all of these
[41:02] other things. Hey, listen. We can't HAVE
[41:03] THAT ATTITUDE BECAUSE I NEED CHRIST. I
[41:06] WANT ALL OF CHRIST. And Emanuel is still
[41:08] here. AMEN. HE'S HERE. GOD WITH US.
[41:11] AMEN. This is why I can say God is still
[41:13] with us because GOD IS IN US. BUT HE'S
[41:16] IN ME AND HE'S UNLOCKED A PORTION OF
[41:18] THAT LIFE TO ME. BUT IF I WANT FULLNESS
[41:20] OF EMANUEL, I NEED YOU,
[41:22] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[41:23] &gt;&gt; And you and you and you and YOU BECAUSE
[41:25] HE'S HERE. HE'S STILL WITH US. HE'S IN A
[41:28] MANY membered body.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; WHERE EVERY JOINT IS BROUGHT TOGETHER TO
[41:33] SUPPLY FOR the effectual working
[41:35] together OF ITSELF IN LOVE. AMEN. SO
[41:37] WE'RE ALL BUILT UP INTO UNITY AND COME
[41:39] INTO THE fullness of THE STATURE OF
[41:40] CHRIST. THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALL HERE TO
[41:43] EXPRESS HIM. BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
[41:45] EXPRESS ALL OF HIM. AND I'M not going to
[41:47] express ALL OF HIM. I WILL EXPRESS AN
[41:49] ATTRIBUTE OF HIM, A PORTION of him, what
[41:51] he designated for me. BUT IT'S GOING TO
[41:53] TAKE ALL OF US TO EXPRESS HIM.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; SO, we need one another.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; We need one another. And it's amazing
[42:04] how the devil gets in and makes the very
[42:06] thing we need for the full expression of
[42:08] Christ sometimes the hardest thing to
[42:10] deal with. Because if you're going to
[42:11] deal with human beings, you're going to
[42:13] deal with issues.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Does anybody believe that?
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Well, not the children of God. There'll
[42:21] be no issues.
[42:25] [laughter]
[42:26] &gt;&gt; You should be a pastor for a month.
[42:32] Brother Benham said, "We all have a
[42:34] sticky, cocka nature."
[42:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; That's going to bother us till we get
[42:38] out of here.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes your sticky cocka
[42:42] burner nature poked me.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; And if you poke me, I want to run away
[42:48] and hide so I don't get poked again.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Anybody ever felt that way?
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Of course.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Because if you're dealing with human
[42:59] beings that are still in a hybrid flesh,
[43:03] there's issues.
[43:06] with one another,
[43:09] &gt;&gt; forgiving one another, being patient
[43:12] with one. Why did Paul tell us all of
[43:13] that if we've already come into
[43:15] perfection?
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Why do we have to forebear one another?
[43:18] Why do we have to be patient? Why do we
[43:19] have to patiently love one another? Why
[43:21] do we need brotherly love?
[43:24] &gt;&gt; We should just come into agape love and
[43:26] it's all perfect. Listen, we're still
[43:27] human beings and we've got to put up
[43:29] with one another and bear with one
[43:30] another. Why? Because it's a many
[43:32] membered body, not a single many
[43:34] membered body. I am not fine by myself.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Cuz he didn't give me all of it.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; He only gave me a portion.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; But he's still Emanuel.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; He's still with us.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; You know,
[43:53] &gt;&gt; when you're fellowshipping with a
[43:54] brother and you're you're sharing the
[43:57] word with one another, what kind of
[44:00] communion is that?
[44:02] &gt;&gt; And who are you really communing with?
[44:04] What life is trapped inside that brother
[44:06] or sister? Who who who is it? What is it
[44:09] that I'm enjoying so much? Maybe it's
[44:12] him
[44:13] &gt;&gt; in you and in him and in her. Amen.
[44:16] Coming together to fellowship to
[44:18] manifest the life of Christ. So he
[44:21] didn't pour the whole thing out in just
[44:23] me. He didn't pour the whole thing out
[44:26] in just us,
[44:28] &gt;&gt; but he poured it out in the church, the
[44:29] bride. Universal.
[44:36] Brother Beam says, "All of us know that
[44:37] God was in Christ, reconciling the world
[44:39] to himself. Now we know that Christ
[44:42] Jesus, the fullness of the Godhead
[44:43] bodily, dwells in him. But to us, we
[44:46] have the spirit by measure given to each
[44:49] one to profit with all." Do you believe
[44:52] that?
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; So you have He's given to us the spirit
[44:56] by measure
[44:59] to profit with all.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. That means he didn't give you the
[45:03] spirit by measure to profit you.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; He gave you the spirit by measure to
[45:10] profit everybody else.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; But the measure he gave them is to
[45:14] profit you.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[45:18] &gt;&gt; I think God designed it this way because
[45:19] he wants to manifest in a body.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Now, but say for instance, if I went out
[45:25] here to the ocean and took a spoonful of
[45:27] water out of the ocean, you'd never miss
[45:29] it. See, but I could take that spoonful
[45:31] of water to the laboratory and it's got
[45:32] the same chemicals in that the entire
[45:34] ocean's got. It's just not as much of
[45:36] it. Well, when when we think of the
[45:39] spirit of Christ that we have in us,
[45:40] it's just a spoonful to what was in him,
[45:43] we had all he had all of it in him and
[45:46] and that God was poor. All that God was
[45:49] poured into Christ. All that Christ was,
[45:51] he poured into the church. So, Brother
[45:53] Bon says, "Go get you a little spoonful
[45:55] of the ocean. What you got is the ocean.
[45:57] Yeah,
[45:58] &gt;&gt; you got all of the you got all of the
[46:00] the properties, the possibilities, the
[46:02] potential of the ocean, but you've only
[46:04] got it in a small measure.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; That's what happens when we have the
[46:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. We've
[46:09] got the life of Christ, but he's given
[46:11] us a portion, and that portion is for a
[46:13] purpose to unlock an attribute that's
[46:15] already in the seed that he wants to
[46:16] express.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it doesn't mean that the whole
[46:22] ocean's not available. That's right.
[46:24] Amen.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; And just because I have a spoonful, I
[46:27] don't have to make do with just a
[46:28] spoonful because God has poured the
[46:31] whole ocean out. Amen. And the whole
[46:33] ocean was poured into Christ. Amen. But
[46:35] all that Christ was WAS POURED WHERE?
[46:37] BACK into a many member body. The ocean
[46:40] is still available. The fullness is
[46:42] still here. Amen. Christ in full measure
[46:44] is still available. Amen. And it's in my
[46:46] brother. It's my sister. The portion
[46:49] that I need might be in you. Remember to
[46:52] one is given the gift of knowledge,
[46:55] another wisdom, another faith, another
[46:57] healing, another tongues, ANOTHER
[46:59] INTERPRETATIONS. WHY? HE THE SPIRIT
[47:01] DIVIDE SEVERALLY AS he will. Amen. So
[47:04] that we have a mutual dependency on one
[47:06] another because God wants to be
[47:08] expressed IN BRIDE FORM IN a many member
[47:11] body.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; AND IT TAKES A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP
[47:15] WHERE I HAVE TO benefit you and you have
[47:17] to benefit me. And sometimes the BENEFIT
[47:20] IS IRON SHARPENING IRON.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible says we should
[47:25] provoke one another to love and good
[47:27] works.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Provoke means to go or to poke.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; LIKE WHEN AN OX IS PLOWING, you know,
[47:34] and he's, you know, he gets lazy, he
[47:36] stops, there's a little poker there on a
[47:38] stick and they'll poke him right behind
[47:39] the leg just to keep him moving.
[47:43] WE ALWAYS VIEW, I ALWAYS VIEW, HAVE
[47:45] ALWAYS have viewed, always view that
[47:47] provoking one another to love and good
[47:49] works would be something where, you
[47:51] know, a brother would come to you and
[47:52] say, "Oh man, you're doing a good job.
[47:54] We love you." You know, just keep at it,
[47:56] Brother Chad, and blah blah blah blah
[47:58] blah. You're the sweetest thing, nicest
[47:59] thing, handsomest thing, best thing.
[48:03] That encourages me. [laughter]
[48:06] But it may not just be the sweetness
[48:08] that provokes me to love and good works.
[48:10] But it might even be an irritation. It
[48:12] might even be a hurt. It might be
[48:13] something else that keeps me moving
[48:15] forward because I need more of Christ.
[48:17] Amen. I'm not going to overcome this
[48:18] without more of him, without more of his
[48:20] life.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:24] So God has given us a portion and that
[48:27] portion is real and that portion is
[48:29] powerful and that portion is Christ.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; But he hasn't given me the whole load.
[48:36] So I need you,
[48:39] you need me, we need one another.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; In Ephesians, he says, "Now therefore,
[48:46] you are no more strangers and
[48:47] foreigners, but fellow citizens with the
[48:49] saints and of the household of God, and
[48:52] are built upon the foundation of the
[48:53] apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
[48:55] himself being the chief cornerstone, in
[48:58] whom all the building fitly framed
[48:59] together growth into a holy temple in
[49:01] the Lord, in whom ye also are builded
[49:04] together for a habitation of God through
[49:07] the spirit."
[49:08] I love this. I just I get so excited. Ye
[49:12] are builded together
[49:15] &gt;&gt; for a habitation of God.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Not singular.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Together.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; You are the temple of the Holy Ghost. As
[49:23] an individual, you're the temple of the
[49:24] Holy Ghost. But when we talk about all
[49:26] of the Holy Ghost, now we're a building
[49:29] built together.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Living stones built into a living
[49:34] tabernacle, a holy habitation for God to
[49:36] dwell in.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; That's us.
[49:41] He says in Ephesians 5, "For we are
[49:43] members of his body, of his flesh, and
[49:45] of his bones." We, and the Bible says
[49:48] somewhere else, we are members in
[49:49] particular. That means you're a
[49:51] particular member. You're not the whole
[49:53] thing.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; So you who thought you were great, God
[49:58] has a way of bringing us all into
[49:59] equity.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; In one way, yes, and another way, no.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; What's great is that God dwells in you.
[50:08] That's fantastic.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; But but where the where the need comes
[50:13] in is he's not poured all of himself
[50:16] into you, only a portion of himself into
[50:18] you. But if you want all of him, you
[50:20] need the rest of the body.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; I think it's good he did it that way.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; I think it teaches us a lot of things
[50:28] that we need to know.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; And it brings us into the right attitude
[50:32] towards God, a right attitude towards
[50:34] our brother and sister, a right attitude
[50:36] towards ourselves. because we still have
[50:39] this need.
[50:41] Amen. Brother Beam says, "His church is
[50:45] himself revealed."
[50:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Do you see it? And expressed by the word
[50:50] itself that he is God. Oh, I love this.
[50:55] His church is himself expressed.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Each member is a member of that
[51:01] expression or part of that expression.
[51:03] But it's the total the the sum total
[51:05] together that is him being expressed.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; I'm part of that expression because I'm
[51:11] a member of that body
[51:14] &gt;&gt; and and in some ways the whole
[51:16] expression is reflecting through me
[51:17] because it's reflecting through every
[51:19] member.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; But to get the full picture takes the
[51:22] whole body.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; There are things of Christ of of God's
[51:26] attributes that I cannot express because
[51:28] he put me in the form of male.
[51:31] So I can't express the feminine nature.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; I can't express motherhood. I can't
[51:37] express uh chastity. I can't express
[51:40] some of these things. I cannot express.
[51:42] Amen. Because God put me in a certain
[51:44] form and a certain position in a certain
[51:46] place. And he put inside of me a certain
[51:48] portion of himself and attribute. Amen.
[51:50] and and and and and you remember when
[51:52] Daniel White was preaching at the
[51:54] retreat and he says the Holy Ghost is
[51:57] limited by the vessel in which he's
[52:00] expressing through.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; I I don't may not have worded that just
[52:03] right, but I hope you know what I mean.
[52:04] His expression is limited. So God is not
[52:07] going to express motherhood through me.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[52:12] Even though the Holy Ghost can express
[52:14] El Shadai, the nature of God, the
[52:16] breasted one, he's not going to do it
[52:18] through me, because the Holy Ghost
[52:20] expression in me is limited by the
[52:22] tabernacle he chooses to dwell in.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; He made me male, not female.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; All right.
[52:30] So,
[52:32] God positioned us and placed us and
[52:35] equipped us and put a portion of himself
[52:37] to express that portion for the benefit
[52:39] of everybody else. Amen. Yeah.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; And everybody else has something to
[52:44] benefit me.
[52:46] And so God
[52:49] God called us to depend on one another,
[52:53] &gt;&gt; to love one another, to edify one
[52:56] another. And that's what he's called us
[52:58] to do.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; That's the expression now of Christ in a
[53:02] many membered body. Christ in bride
[53:04] form. That's the expression he wishes to
[53:07] express himself in. Now,
[53:10] &gt;&gt; if that's the expression that he's
[53:12] choosing to express himself in, a many
[53:14] membered bride, where do you think the
[53:16] devil will place the attack?
[53:20] &gt;&gt; On fellowship with a many membered
[53:23] bride.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; That's where he'll train his guns
[53:26] because that's the way he wants to
[53:28] express himself now. So he'll divide
[53:30] fellowship and he'll pull peel people
[53:32] out of fellowship and he'll cause people
[53:34] to go home and listen to tapes by
[53:36] themselves and all kinds of tactics
[53:37] he'll use. Amen. Because that's now the
[53:40] expression of Christ, not in one man.
[53:43] Amen. We had it. We saw it again in a
[53:45] glimpse in brother Brandham because he
[53:47] was a son of man revealing the son of
[53:49] man. It was the revelation of Jesus
[53:51] Christ in that man. And Christ was
[53:53] revealing himself, his ministry in one
[53:55] man.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he demonstrated all the signs
[53:58] of the Messiah. He's demonstrated the
[54:00] prophetic gifts. He demonstrated all of
[54:01] it.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; But that's not what he's doing now.
[54:07] Amen. Now, what did he do? He did that
[54:09] in order to unite the headship with the
[54:11] body, the bridegroom with the bride, so
[54:14] that now Christ can come into bride form
[54:16] and be expressed and a many membered
[54:18] bride.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's not about me just doing
[54:24] what works for me and me having the
[54:26] expression and me being Christ and I'm
[54:28] this and I'm that and I'm that. That's
[54:30] not the expression now. Not what I am is
[54:33] not the expression. It's what we are is
[54:35] the expression.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; And I need to be careful of that
[54:39] revelation that I don't get too caught
[54:41] up in myself and I become the fullness
[54:44] and I become this and my idea becomes
[54:46] the trump card to everything else.
[54:48] That's not the expression now. The
[54:49] expression now is we
[54:52] &gt;&gt; many membered body and I'm just a part
[54:55] of that body and I want to be a
[54:56] contributing part of that body but I
[54:58] also want to receive from other
[55:00] contributing parts of that body.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; That's what makes us healthy.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we just need to understand the
[55:08] devil's tactics. He's always attacking
[55:10] where God is expressing.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Always.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; And he always will.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we shouldn't get surprised
[55:18] &gt;&gt; when he does that.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; And Christ is the mystery of God
[55:22] revealed. It says it depends on where
[55:23] you're born from. If you're born of the
[55:25] word of God, God's word has the
[55:27] preeminence in his church. That's what
[55:29] he died for. That's his purpose. That he
[55:31] might be able to achieve to have his
[55:33] preeminence working in his church. Let
[55:35] the word of God shine forth first, no
[55:37] matter what anything else looks like.
[55:40] So, what am I supposed to do as a part
[55:42] of this body? Amen. Let the I'm sorry. I
[55:46] do not like crossing out words.
[55:49] That makes me that makes me cringe.
[55:52] Let the word of God shine forth first.
[55:56] What am I supposed to do? Let the word
[55:58] shine out of my life. What's my
[56:00] contributing part? What what am I
[56:02] supposed to do? Just let the word live
[56:04] in me. Whatever the word says about me,
[56:07] whatever part I can fulfill, whichever
[56:10] way the word can shape me and guide me
[56:12] and change my conduct, change my speech,
[56:14] change my actions, let everything match
[56:16] his word and then I'll be doing what
[56:17] he's asked me to do.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't want to make it too
[56:22] complicated.
[56:24] Amen. So now all of that's a foundation.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Hey, praise God.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; We did it quickly. Amen. You guys were
[56:34] wonderful. Now, there's something else I
[56:36] want to share.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is what's been on my
[56:40] heart.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Says in Zechariah 14:7, "But it shall be
[56:45] one day which shall be known to the
[56:47] Lord, not day nor night, but it shall
[56:49] come to pass that at evening time it
[56:52] shall be light."
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:55] This brother Bam takes and he begins to
[56:57] use this and lay this scripture over the
[56:59] church ages and begin to show us that
[57:02] when man moved away from the pure
[57:04] teaching of the apostles, Amen, and of
[57:06] Christ, they they began to mix in their
[57:08] own uh thinking into it and it became an
[57:11] obscure an obscure day where the light
[57:13] he said they had just enough light to
[57:15] get saved by.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Just enough light to know that he was a
[57:19] healer. Just enough light for
[57:20] sanctification, but not the full light.
[57:22] And he and he attaches this to the
[57:24] church ages so that we'll understand.
[57:26] Amen. How the church ages were coming
[57:27] through partial light. Partial light.
[57:30] But it says, "But it shall come to pass
[57:33] that at the evening time it shall be
[57:35] light." He said, "The sun that rose in
[57:38] the east is the same sun that sets in
[57:40] the west. And now when the and when the
[57:42] sun begins to dip out of those cloudy
[57:44] skies, it begins to shine in the
[57:46] fullness of of its brightness as it
[57:48] shone the first time."
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. What God intended for his church
[57:51] to be, it's going to be. What he wanted,
[57:54] what he did at the day of Pentecost,
[57:55] what he started in the book of Acts is
[57:57] what he is having now.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Cuz he promised he would.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the evening time, it shall be
[58:05] light.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says this is the evening
[58:08] time. The end time, the end time
[58:10] message. And it's to do what? It's to
[58:13] reproduce Jesus Christ in bride form.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; And you're a part and I'm a part. And
[58:19] all of us are here to shine that light
[58:21] in our lives. What is the light? The
[58:22] revelation of the word. How do I shine
[58:24] it in my life? By surrendering to the
[58:26] word and living the word. Amen. By not
[58:28] living in compromise. By not taking my
[58:30] own own ideas. By not mixing the word,
[58:33] amen, with my own thoughts. But just
[58:35] coming back to the pure word that's been
[58:37] delivered us to us through a prophetic
[58:38] ministry and surrendering to it and
[58:40] SAYING, "IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, THAT'S
[58:42] WHAT I WANT." AMEN. AMEN.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; And we begin to shine the light in the
[58:47] evening time.
[58:49] Amen. And in the Smyrna church age, he
[58:52] says, "In the Ephesians age and in this
[58:54] age and in every age, we contemplate, we
[58:57] will see that this is true. And in the
[59:00] last age, which is our age, we will find
[59:02] the blackout of the word, the complete
[59:05] apostasy ending in the great
[59:07] tribulation." So, brother Bam tells us
[59:09] that when we get to the Leodysian church
[59:11] age, there's going to be a complete
[59:13] blackout of the word.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; So, what is light? The word. When it's
[59:18] blacked out, it becomes darkness.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; And in the last age, there'll be a
[59:24] complete blackout of the word. The
[59:26] complete apostasy ending in the great
[59:28] tribulation.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; That's where Leodysia is heading.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Complete blackout. Brother Brandham even
[59:35] looked in one place. He says, you know,
[59:36] I could see no light past 1977. It was
[59:39] all darkness.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he looked into the church,
[59:44] Amen. When he looked into the church in
[59:46] the Leodysian church age, it went into
[59:48] complete apostasy. And God verified
[59:50] this. Amen. At the at the end of uh I
[59:53] think it was the end of 1964. Amen. When
[59:56] he showed, Amen. an eclipse of the moon
[59:58] in the sky and put it in the papers
[59:59] across the nation, there was only six
[1:00:01] pictures. There wasn't a seven. And he
[1:00:03] showed that it typed Amen. The same
[1:00:05] image that he drew on the blackboard
[1:00:07] when he preached, Amen. the the seven
[1:00:09] church ages. The same image that was
[1:00:10] reflected by the pillar of fire on the
[1:00:12] back wall of BRANDHAM TABERNACLE. BUT
[1:00:14] NOW when he comes to 1964, HE SHOWS THAT
[1:00:18] NOW IT'S DIFFERENT. HE SAID, "I SHOWED
[1:00:19] YOU SEVEN with a little sliver of light.
[1:00:21] It reflected back on the back wall. BUT
[1:00:23] WHEN GOD showed it in the heavens, there
[1:00:25] was no seventh picture BECAUSE IT WAS
[1:00:28] ALL BLACK. Completely black. No more
[1:00:30] light in the denominations."
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:35] BUT I THOUGHT ZACHCHARIAH said it would
[1:00:37] be light in the evening time. It is
[1:00:39] light in the evening time. IT'S THE
[1:00:41] ABSOLUTE APOSTASY FOR DENOMINATIONAL
[1:00:43] SYSTEMS. APOSTASY FOR CHURCH SYSTEMS.
[1:00:45] AMEN. BUT FOR THE TRUE BRIDE OF JESUS
[1:00:48] CHRIST, IT IS THE RISING OF THE SUN. IT
[1:00:50] IS THE DAWN OF A NEW DAY. IT IS THE
[1:00:52] LIGHT IN THE EVENING TIME. It depends ON
[1:00:54] WHICH SIDE OF THE EQUATION YOU'RE ON
[1:00:56] WHETHER IT'S LIGHT OR DARKNESS.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I FEEL SO PRIVILEGED, so blessed,
[1:01:04] SO THANKFUL BY GOD TO HAVE EYES TO SEE
[1:01:06] and ears to hear. Amen. And in no way
[1:01:08] does it make me feel superior to another
[1:01:10] fellow human being. Listen, there's
[1:01:12] other human beings that I like better
[1:01:14] than I like me. There's others that are
[1:01:16] nicer and more congenial. Amen. Have
[1:01:18] better attitude than I have. AMEN. BUT
[1:01:19] THEY CAN'T SEE THE TRUTH. BUT I THANK
[1:01:22] GOD NO MATTER HOW REPROBATE I'VE been in
[1:01:24] the past and all my fo v foibless AND
[1:01:26] ALL MY COMPLEXES, I STILL SEE THE LIGHT.
[1:01:28] AMEN. FOR ME, IT'S THE RISING OF THE
[1:01:30] SUN. IT'S NOT APOSTASY. IT'S NOT
[1:01:33] DARKNESS. IT'S NOT CONFUSION. BUT IT'S
[1:01:35] ABSOLUTE TRUTH AND LIGHT. I KNOW WHERE
[1:01:38] I'M WALKING. I KNOW WHERE I CAME FROM. I
[1:01:39] KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. BECAUSE WHEN THE
[1:01:41] LIGHT COMES UP, YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF YOU'RE STILL SITTING IN
[1:01:47] CONFUSION, COME TO THE MESSAGE AND LET
[1:01:49] GOD OPEN YOUR EYES. CUZ IT'S THE LIGHT
[1:01:51] THAT SHOWS YOU WHERE YOU ARE, WHO YOU
[1:01:53] ARE, WHERE YOU CAME FROM, WHERE YOU'RE
[1:01:56] GOING. IT'S THIS LIGHT THAT REVEALS THE
[1:01:58] PATH.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IN THE CHURCH IS CONFUSION.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; The systems of man are confusion. The
[1:02:07] message is the light of the hour.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember the story brother Benham
[1:02:12] told of the man who went fishing. He
[1:02:15] went fishing with an old fisherman and
[1:02:16] they got off the coast and they GOT INTO
[1:02:18] A DENSE FOG AND THEY COULDN'T SEE the
[1:02:20] lighthouse anymore. They couldn't hear
[1:02:22] the fog horn. They got out there and and
[1:02:24] the the young man who was just going
[1:02:26] along with the old fisherman. He got
[1:02:27] nervous. He got scared. started standing
[1:02:29] up and saying, "WE'RE WE'RE BEING TOWED
[1:02:31] OUT. WE'RE GOING OUT TO SEA. WE'RE GOING
[1:02:33] OUT TO SEA." AMEN. AND HE WAS ALL
[1:02:34] nervous and scared that they were going
[1:02:36] to be lost.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; But the old fisherman said, "Sit down,
[1:02:40] son.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Let's just wait till the sun comes out
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; and lift this fog. Then we'll see where
[1:02:47] we're at."
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Not running all over trying to figure
[1:02:51] this out and figure this out and figure
[1:02:52] that out and find a path and rowing the
[1:02:54] wrong direction. All just wait until THE
[1:02:57] SUN COMES UP. WAIT TILL GOD TAKES THE
[1:02:59] SCALES OFF OF YOUR EYES. WAIT TILL THIS
[1:03:01] MESSAGE becomes a living reality to you
[1:03:03] and you can see with the light of the
[1:03:04] age and then you'll KNOW WHERE YOU'RE AT
[1:03:06] AND YOU'LL KNOW WHERE TO GO AND YOU'LL
[1:03:08] KNOW WHAT DIRECTION TO ROW IN.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Until then, WE'RE JUST WANDERING ABOUT
[1:03:12] TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE best
[1:03:14] thing to do.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Live the best life we can. Do what we
[1:03:18] thought was right. Find out most of what
[1:03:20] we did was wrong.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:25] Let's come to the rising of the sun.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Man, the Eliseian church has gone into
[1:03:31] complete apostasy.
[1:03:33] There's no light there.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; There's no life there. There's no Christ
[1:03:38] there.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; I know it hurts people's feelings, but
[1:03:41] it doesn't mean they won't be saved. I'm
[1:03:43] not saying there's no hope.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; The white throne judgment shows us that.
[1:03:49] Yeah.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; But Christ poured himself into his bride
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; in fullness. That's where his life is.
[1:03:55] That's where Emanuel is.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; That's where he's living and dwelling
[1:04:00] and moving. And that's where he's doing
[1:04:02] his work.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:08] In the Leodysian church age in
[1:04:11] Revelation 3, it says, "Behold, I stand
[1:04:13] at the door and knock. If any man hear
[1:04:15] my voice and open the door, I will come
[1:04:17] in to him and will suck with him and he
[1:04:19] with me. Brother Bam comes to the
[1:04:21] scripture and he says, this is the only
[1:04:23] church age of the seven church ages
[1:04:25] where you find Jesus Christ outside the
[1:04:27] church
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; because they pushed the word out.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; And when you push the word out, you
[1:04:33] pushed the light out.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; You pushed the life out
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; when you pushed the word out. And he
[1:04:41] came in the Leodysian church age through
[1:04:43] a prophetic ministry as the light, as
[1:04:45] the life, the son of man ministry, the
[1:04:48] Messiah, the word, the anointed word for
[1:04:51] our day. And it was rejected,
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; wholesale, rejected by denominations and
[1:04:58] by the Christianom
[1:05:00] because it wasn't for everyone.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; It was only for a specific group of
[1:05:05] people
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; and it was for those who were
[1:05:08] predestinated to believe. predestinated
[1:05:11] to receive
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; and that's who he came for. And I'm so
[1:05:15] glad I can say he came for me.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; I was lost in darkness. I had no idea
[1:05:23] what was right, what was wrong, what
[1:05:24] should be done, what shouldn't be done.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; But this message was the rising of the
[1:05:30] sun for me.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; It was the lifting of the fog for me. It
[1:05:35] showed me where I was and where I came
[1:05:38] from. And I realized how far away I was
[1:05:41] trying to serve God, trying to serve
[1:05:42] through the traditions of my grandfather
[1:05:44] and my father. And I found out where I
[1:05:46] really was.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; And his word began to expose my
[1:05:50] condition, but it also began to point me
[1:05:52] to the path
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; back to Christ.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Me says this in the feast of
[1:06:00] trumpets. He said, "The church world
[1:06:03] rejects Christ and he's put on the
[1:06:05] outside." And the same trumpet, the same
[1:06:08] seal rather, when it was open to show
[1:06:10] Jesus on the outside of the church
[1:06:12] trying to get back in. At the same time,
[1:06:14] the trumpet sounds for the Jews. And the
[1:06:16] Jews recognize the atonement. Glory,
[1:06:18] hallelujah. Oh my. The Holy Spirit has
[1:06:20] been bound by these denominational
[1:06:22] rivers for almost 2,000 years. But it is
[1:06:25] to be loosed in the evening time by the
[1:06:27] evening time message. The Holy Spirit
[1:06:29] back in the church again. Christ himself
[1:06:33] revealed in human flesh in the evening
[1:06:35] time. He said it. He promised it.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; All that God was, he poured into Christ.
[1:06:40] All that Christ is, he's poured into the
[1:06:42] church.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; That got bound by denominational rivers
[1:06:47] and that limited the expression and the
[1:06:49] freedom of the Holy Ghost because the
[1:06:50] word was bound and the word was pushed
[1:06:52] out of the church. But at the opening of
[1:06:54] the seals, at the end time message,
[1:06:56] Amen. the Holy Ghost was loosed. Amen.
[1:06:58] Loosed meaning, Amen. Whatever was
[1:07:00] hindering, whatever was binding,
[1:07:02] whatever it kept him out, whatever these
[1:07:04] denominational rivers were that acted
[1:07:06] like a barrier for the full life of
[1:07:07] Christ, it's been removed by the message
[1:07:10] of the hour. And what was it? Wrong
[1:07:12] understanding, WRONG TEACHING, FALSE
[1:07:14] DOCTRINE, the wrong idea of the teaching
[1:07:17] of Paul. But when God came back and
[1:07:18] restored the word and brought us out of
[1:07:20] man's ideas and brought us out of
[1:07:22] denominational ideas and brought us back
[1:07:24] to the original truth, it removed the
[1:07:26] barrier.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And at the opening of the seals,
[1:07:30] the revelation of who the church is and
[1:07:32] what the church and two vines and what
[1:07:33] it's all been about and who the real
[1:07:35] bride is and who's not. Amen. The veil
[1:07:37] lifted, the mist is gone, the barrier is
[1:07:40] gone, and the Holy Ghost is back
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; in the church again.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Like it was in the book of Acts in the
[1:07:46] beginning. Amen. There it went into
[1:07:48] Jews. As it moved to Gentiles, when it
[1:07:50] moved into Gentiles, then it went into
[1:07:52] it went into a fallen condition. And it
[1:07:54] took seven church ages, amen, to rebuild
[1:07:57] that body, to bring it back to the
[1:07:59] second Eve, to the bride of Jesus
[1:08:00] Christ, to bring us to an invisible
[1:08:02] union.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; But just like the first time when
[1:08:07] Pentecost fell and Christ returned to
[1:08:09] the church,
[1:08:13] only the predestinated saw it.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; And only they received it.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was just a small group of Jews
[1:08:24] at the beginning. Then it began to grow
[1:08:26] and then it dispersed and it was always
[1:08:28] in the minority.
[1:08:31] Amen. And when when Christ Jesus, the
[1:08:35] son of man, when he came in his
[1:08:38] prophetic ministry in flesh 2,000 years
[1:08:40] ago, he was the son of man. And he came
[1:08:42] to fulfill the scriptures, the
[1:08:44] prophecies that were told of him. And
[1:08:46] when he came the church world in that
[1:08:48] day, the old traditional teaching of the
[1:08:50] Jewish fathers, they rejected him.
[1:08:54] And when they rejected him at Calvary,
[1:08:57] when his blood was shed, he purchased a
[1:08:59] way to come back into his people. Amen.
[1:09:01] And on the day of Pentecost, he entered
[1:09:03] into the remnant,
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; the few that could believe.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Then he go, we go through a cycle of
[1:09:12] church ages through the Gentile
[1:09:13] dispensation, not the Jewish
[1:09:14] dispensation. And that was the end of
[1:09:16] the Jewish dispensation. The end of that
[1:09:18] was a wholesale rejection of Jesus
[1:09:20] Christ, the son of man, and Christ now
[1:09:23] pouring himself out into only those who
[1:09:25] would receive him.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Then it moves to the Gentiles and they
[1:09:29] follow the same path as the Jews. If you
[1:09:31] look through the Old Testament, there
[1:09:33] was revivals and failings and there was
[1:09:35] there was all through the Old Testament
[1:09:37] is the same thing we see in the New
[1:09:39] Testament through the seven church ages.
[1:09:41] Amen. They would have a godly judge.
[1:09:42] There would be a revival. There'd be a
[1:09:44] kicking out of the Philistines only for
[1:09:45] two or three generations later to come
[1:09:47] right back into bondage and into
[1:09:49] idolatry and to all the curses.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; And it was a cycle that continued just
[1:09:54] like the church ages.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it culminated in the son of
[1:09:58] man coming, God coming in flesh. Amen.
[1:10:01] And then pouring himself out and just to
[1:10:03] the remnant who would receive him. But
[1:10:05] then in the New Testament, it follows
[1:10:07] the same pattern the Gentiles did. Amen.
[1:10:09] What the Jews did. They started their
[1:10:10] systems and they divided themselves and
[1:10:12] added their own understanding. Amen. And
[1:10:14] it come all the way through a cycle of
[1:10:16] revival and death and revival and death
[1:10:18] until it comes to the end time. And what
[1:10:20] do we have at the end time? We have the
[1:10:22] son of man again. The same thing the
[1:10:25] Jews received. The same thing THE
[1:10:26] SAMARITANS RECEIVED. NOW WE RECEIVED IT.
[1:10:29] And how did we receive it? We received
[1:10:31] it IN A PROPHETIC MINISTRY. A son of man
[1:10:33] revealing the son of man. the same the
[1:10:36] son of man that revealed himself to the
[1:10:38] Jews and to the Samaritans.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; And now he came and did the same thing
[1:10:43] he did then.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. He told him how many husbands they
[1:10:47] had. I mean he told them where they were
[1:10:49] at. AMEN. WHEN PHILIP CALLED THEM AND
[1:10:51] TOLD THEM WHO THEIR FATHER WAS. TOLD
[1:10:53] THEM ALL OF THESE THINGS. THE SAME SIGNS
[1:10:55] THAT HE DID. The messianic sign, the
[1:10:57] sign of the son of man was performed
[1:10:59] this day to prove that Christ is here.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Brandham said, "My
[1:11:04] ministry is to prove that he is here."
[1:11:06] To declare that he is here.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Who's here? The son of man. The
[1:11:10] prophetic ministry of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:12] Amen. The same one that was there.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Only he never presented himself to the
[1:11:18] Gentiles yet.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; He presented himself to the Jews and to
[1:11:22] the Samaritans and they rejected him.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; But now at the end of time, the same son
[1:11:28] of man presents himself to the Gentiles.
[1:11:31] And what do they do? The same thing the
[1:11:33] Jews and the Samaritans did.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; They rejected him. Only a remnant
[1:11:38] believed.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; And what happened to that remnant that
[1:11:44] believed? The same thing that happened
[1:11:46] on the day of Pentecost after he was
[1:11:48] rejected after the second crucifixion of
[1:11:51] Jesus Christ.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Remember brother Brandon preached
[1:11:54] indictment. You're crucifying Aresh the
[1:11:56] word of God.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. When the seals are open and the
[1:12:02] barrier comes down, the full measure of
[1:12:05] Christ comes back into the church again.
[1:12:08] And that's where we're at, friends.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; It's Christ in a many membered body,
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; growing us, perfecting us, expressing
[1:12:18] himself through a many membered bride.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Spirit, look at this
[1:12:26] word, back in the church again.
[1:12:29] been bound for nearly 2,000 years. But
[1:12:32] now in the evening time, the evening
[1:12:33] light, the rising of the sun,
[1:12:36] Christ back in the church again.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I can't claim
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; that it's all in me.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Cuz he's back in the church again.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; He's in you and me.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; And we're together shining this light.
[1:12:57] Brother Benham comes to this scripture
[1:12:59] here. I love it. Isaiah 60. It says,
[1:13:02] "Arise and shine for thy light has come
[1:13:06] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[1:13:08] thee. For behold, the darkness shall
[1:13:10] cover the earth and gross darkness the
[1:13:12] people, but the Lord shall arise upon
[1:13:15] thee, and his glory shall be seen upon
[1:13:18] thee."
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram preaches this. Amen. as the
[1:13:24] rising of the sun
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; preaches this in shalom. Good morning.
[1:13:27] Amen. The light is come. Amen. Thy light
[1:13:30] is come. So arise and shine. What is our
[1:13:34] commandment? To shine.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; What is the commandment for the church?
[1:13:38] Amen. That has been in the day that's
[1:13:40] neither been day or dark. It's neither
[1:13:42] night nor day. Amen. But whether it's
[1:13:44] had a cloudy day, a gloomy day. Amen.
[1:13:47] But but at at the rising of the sun,
[1:13:49] when the veil is taken off, when the sun
[1:13:51] comes out and the fog is lifted, he's
[1:13:53] telling you to arise
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; and shine.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; That's what we're SUPPOSED TO DO. ARISE
[1:13:59] AND SHINE. WELL, HOW DO I SHINE, BROTHER
[1:14:01] CHAD? BROTHER BRENHAM ALREADY TOLD us by
[1:14:03] living the word first. Amen. By giving
[1:14:05] him preeminence, by whatever THAT WORD
[1:14:07] HAS TAUGHT US TO DO. JUST DO IT. Just
[1:14:09] live it. Just surrender to it and shine
[1:14:11] the light of Christ.
[1:14:13] Give him your life and let the spirit of
[1:14:15] God come in and live his life, his
[1:14:18] manifestations, his works. The same
[1:14:20] works THAT HE DID BEFORE. HE'S NOT
[1:14:22] CHANGING HIS WORKS. HE'S DOING THE same
[1:14:24] work. Only now he's not doing it in one
[1:14:26] man. He's spreading it across the whole
[1:14:27] body.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:32] Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and
[1:14:35] the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[1:14:37] thee. For behold, the darkness shall
[1:14:40] cover the earth and gross darkness the
[1:14:43] people. I believe this is the Leodysian
[1:14:45] church age.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Complete apostasy, total darkness.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; But the Lord shall arise upon thee.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; And his glory shall be seen upon thee.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; What are we supposed to do? We're
[1:15:03] supposed to be reflecting the light of
[1:15:05] this age.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're supposed to shine because
[1:15:08] his glory is shining on us. His light is
[1:15:11] shining on us. And we're supposed to
[1:15:12] shine back that same light.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:15:18] Now, this is the this is this is the
[1:15:21] main part I wanted to get to.
[1:15:24] And we're going to wrap up with the main
[1:15:25] part. So, don't think we're only halfway
[1:15:27] done. We're beyond halfway done. That
[1:15:30] should make you feel good. I just did
[1:15:32] that to make you feel good. I don't know
[1:15:34] where we're at, but that's where I
[1:15:36] believe we're at. [laughter] I'm being
[1:15:38] as honest as I know how, but
[1:15:41] Matthew 5:13,
[1:15:43] "Ye are the salt of the earth."
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Ye are the salt of the earth.
[1:15:52] But if the salt have lost its savor,
[1:15:53] wherewith shall it be salted? It is
[1:15:55] henceforth good for nothing, but to be
[1:15:57] cast out, and to be trotten underfoot of
[1:15:59] men. Ye are the light of the world.
[1:16:03] This is interesting to me.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Ye are the light of the world.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; I thought Jesus was the light of the
[1:16:10] world.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; He is.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; And ye are the light of the world. It
[1:16:17] all depends on whose life is in you.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; If his life is in you, arise and shine,
[1:16:23] for the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[1:16:25] you.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Ye are the light of the world. A city
[1:16:29] set on a hill cannot be hid.
[1:16:32] Turn with me to 2 Kings chapter 2
[1:16:47] Kings chapter 2
[1:16:52] verse 19.
[1:16:59] Uh 2 2 Kings 2:19.
[1:17:03] And the men of the city said unto
[1:17:05] Elisha, "Behold, I pray thee, the
[1:17:08] situation of the city is pleasant as my
[1:17:10] lord seeth, but the water is not and the
[1:17:14] ground barren." And he said, "Bring me a
[1:17:17] new cruise and put salt therein." And
[1:17:19] they brought it into him. And he went
[1:17:22] forth into the spring of the waters and
[1:17:23] cast the salt in there and said, "Thus
[1:17:26] sayeth the Lord, I have healed these
[1:17:27] waters. There shall not be from thence
[1:17:30] any more death or barren land. So the
[1:17:32] waters were healed into this day
[1:17:34] according to the saying of Elisha which
[1:17:37] he spake.
[1:17:39] So they came to a water that was not
[1:17:43] Amen. And brother Brandon makes this
[1:17:45] statement. He says he says we got a
[1:17:48] beautiful city here set on the hill and
[1:17:50] the views are pretty and it's a fine
[1:17:52] place for school and so forth as Elijah
[1:17:54] had has built but the water here is
[1:17:56] bitter. Remember our talk on the bitter
[1:17:59] water made sweet?
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Everybody said the water here is bitter
[1:18:03] and they needed some uh new spring and
[1:18:06] of course they were changing and they
[1:18:07] had to have a new fountain opened up.
[1:18:10] And so you can't put new wine in old
[1:18:12] bottles. It burst them, you know. And I
[1:18:14] think today is a day also that we need a
[1:18:16] new charge of water. We need a cruise of
[1:18:19] salt, a new cruise of salt in which
[1:18:20] there has never been anything in before.
[1:18:23] And God usually does that. rise up some
[1:18:25] little person out of somewhere that
[1:18:27] knows nothing and throws a cruise of
[1:18:29] salt into some old ecclesiastical
[1:18:30] waters. Where do you think God did that
[1:18:32] in his day?
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Usually rise up some little person out
[1:18:36] of somewhere and knows nothing.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; He's referring to his own ministry.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Throws a cruise of salt into some old
[1:18:44] ecclesiastical waters. Amen. Old
[1:18:47] denominational waters. Amen. To bring
[1:18:49] forth the sweetness of the water once
[1:18:51] again.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Oh man, I love this.
[1:18:54] And the first thing you know, it's all
[1:18:55] become sweet again. Another revival, the
[1:18:58] Holy Ghost of falling on everybody and
[1:19:00] going everywhere. That's what we need
[1:19:02] tonight. That's what we need again is
[1:19:04] another dash of salt. Don't you think
[1:19:06] so? To sweeten up the water. Remember,
[1:19:08] he took a brand new cruise there wherein
[1:19:11] there had nothing uh had been nothing
[1:19:13] and put salt in it. Now, salt is savor
[1:19:15] if it contacts, but it's got to contact
[1:19:18] first. It's got to make contact.
[1:19:21] Then he goes on to say, "We would pray
[1:19:23] Lord that you would pardon all of our
[1:19:25] transgressions, would lead us into the
[1:19:27] paths of light and life and make us Lord
[1:19:29] so salty that others would long to be
[1:19:31] Christians and whom we contact. We know
[1:19:34] that salt is a savior, a saver and it if
[1:19:37] it contacts and father we pray that you
[1:19:39] will make us the strength of the salt
[1:19:41] and may we be so desirous to contact the
[1:19:43] outside world that's dying that it might
[1:19:46] be a saver to them."
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. When when Elisha, amen, came to
[1:19:51] this place, amen, the the sons of the
[1:19:53] prophets were gathered and they they
[1:19:55] said, "Hey, the water here is not and
[1:19:57] the land is barren." And brother Bam
[1:19:58] said, "The water was bitter." And what
[1:20:00] he did is he took some salt. He took a
[1:20:02] new cruise salt and he throw that salt,
[1:20:05] amen, into the water. Amen. And all of a
[1:20:07] sudden, it healed the waters and it
[1:20:09] healed the land and it healed
[1:20:10] everything. Amen. And brother Random
[1:20:12] even typed that with himself that God
[1:20:14] will take somebody from nowhere and
[1:20:15] throw a cru of salt into the old
[1:20:17] ecclesiastical waters. Amen. He was the
[1:20:19] prophetic ministry of Elijah in this
[1:20:21] day. Amen. That was throwing salt into
[1:20:23] the waters.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says, "Ye are the salt of
[1:20:27] the earth." Amen. Ye are THE SALT.
[1:20:30] PRAISE GOD. THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE OF
[1:20:32] YOU THAT'S here for healing. That's here
[1:20:34] for savor. Amen. That's here to make
[1:20:36] contact.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Bham said, "Let's make contact."
[1:20:39] AMEN. WHAT? WHAT? WHAT is this new
[1:20:41] cruise full of salt? Hey, listen.
[1:20:43] THERE'S A NEW CHURCH RISING UP. AMEN.
[1:20:45] IT'S NOT THE OLD denominational church,
[1:20:47] but it's a bride that's been made virgin
[1:20:49] ALL OVER AGAIN. SHE'S MADE FRESH AND
[1:20:51] CLEAN AND NEW LIKE THE ORIGINAL BY WHAT?
[1:20:54] BY THE WASHING OF THE WATER OF THE WORD,
[1:20:56] BY THE POWER THAT HAS BEEN unleashed in
[1:20:58] this message TO PURGE US FROM ALL THE
[1:21:00] FILTH OF DENOMINATIONAL SPIRITS AND
[1:21:02] BRING US BACK TO AN original virgin
[1:21:04] condition. Amen. And that cruise IS FULL
[1:21:06] OF SALT. IT'S GOT LIFE. LISTEN, THE SALT
[1:21:09] IS CHRIST.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE ONE that heals the waters. He's
[1:21:13] the one that heals the barren land. HE'S
[1:21:15] THE HEALER. AMEN. BUT WHERE IS HE? WHERE
[1:21:18] IS CHRIST IN THIS DAY? HE'S IN A MANY
[1:21:20] MEMBERED BODY. WHERE IS THE SALT? IT'S
[1:21:23] IN THE VIRGIN BRIDE. IT'S CHRIST.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN WHEN WHEN WHEN CHRIST LOOKED
[1:21:31] AT PETER AND JAMES and Andrew and and
[1:21:34] and all of them and he SAYS, "YOU'RE THE
[1:21:36] SALT." I DON'T THINK HE WAS TALKING
[1:21:38] ABOUT THEIR FLESH. AMEN. I THINK HE WAS
[1:21:40] TALKING ABOUT THE LIFE THAT WAS IN THEM
[1:21:42] AND HIS LIFE THAT WOULD COME TO THEM.
[1:21:43] THEY HAD SOMETHING TO OFFER. THEY HAD A
[1:21:45] LIFE-GIVING RESOURCE. THEY HAD SOMETHING
[1:21:47] TO TAKE THE BITTERNESS of the WATERS OF
[1:21:49] THIS LIFE AND MAKE OUR LIFE SWEET.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; But if IT WAS GOOD FOR THEM, WHAT ABOUT
[1:21:56] FOR YOU AND I? WHEN HE SAYS, "YOU ARE
[1:21:58] THE SALT OF THE EARTH." I DON'T THINK
[1:21:59] HE'S TALKING ABOUT MY FLESH.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; I was the ONE BORN, AMEN, THROUGH SEXUAL
[1:22:04] DESIRE. I COME THROUGH THE SAME HYBRID
[1:22:07] CONDITION EVERY OTHER human came by.
[1:22:09] AMEN. BUT DOWN INSIDE MY SOUL IS A
[1:22:11] PORTION OF HIMSELF. AND HE BROUGHT A
[1:22:13] SPIRIT IN THIS DAY TO QUICKEN THAT
[1:22:15] PORTION OF HIMSELF. AND I BELIEVE THAT
[1:22:17] HE IS THE SALT. BUT HE IS LIVING IN YOU
[1:22:20] AND I.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; And he has no problem saying you're the
[1:22:23] salt.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; I don't think HE'S TALKING ABOUT FLESH.
[1:22:29] I DON'T THINK HE'S TALKING ABOUT
[1:22:30] HYBRIDIZATION. I DON'T THINK HE'S
[1:22:31] TALKING ABOUT COCKA BURN NATURE. I THINK
[1:22:33] HE'S TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE KNOWS IS
[1:22:35] INSIDE YOU. AMEN. IS THE SALT. THERE'S
[1:22:37] SOMETHING HERE. BROTHER BAM SAID, "AND
[1:22:39] the salt HAS TO MAKE CONTACT. IT'S HERE
[1:22:41] for a reason. IT'S HERE FOR LIFE. IT'S
[1:22:43] HERE FOR PRESERVATION. IT'S HERE TO turn
[1:22:45] the bittersweet. It's here to heal the
[1:22:47] barren land.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; And why IS THE BRIDE HERE? THAT'S WHY
[1:22:51] SHE'S HERE, FRIENDS.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; God has thrown his salt into the earth.
[1:23:03] Do you believe it?
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Because when you remove the bride from
[1:23:09] this earth, what do you have?
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Tribulation.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; The only thing stemming the tide of
[1:23:17] tribulation and holding back the
[1:23:18] antichrist spirit is the presence of
[1:23:21] God's bride.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; She is the salt.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:27] She is preservation.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; She is preserving life, keeping the door
[1:23:34] open, creating the opportunities.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; It's the very presence of Christ.
[1:23:38] Listen,
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; don't don't start thinking that I think
[1:23:41] I'm salt. I ain't no salt.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Christ is salt.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; But I've come into a union with Christ
[1:23:48] and he's alive in me.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; So our job is to carry the salt.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. For who? For everyone else.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; For whosoever will. For the whole world.
[1:24:03] Amen. Listen.
[1:24:05] [clears throat]
[1:24:06] Sometimes Saul gets put in situations it
[1:24:08] doesn't want to be in.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Gets dropped in casserles and stews and
[1:24:14] and bitter waters.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; The salt was never added for the benefit
[1:24:23] of the salt. The salt was added for the
[1:24:25] benefit of whatever salt's added to.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're the salt that God is
[1:24:32] putting in a recipe somewhere
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; and you're not there for you.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're the salt in your workplace.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're the salt in your family.
[1:24:47] Maybe you're the salt. Amen. To your
[1:24:49] neighbors in your neighborhood. Maybe
[1:24:51] you're the salt.
[1:24:53] And God's not putting his salt in the
[1:24:55] place that's most pleasant for the salt.
[1:24:57] He's putting the salt in the place
[1:24:58] that's most needful for the salt.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; A dead spring of bitter water in a
[1:25:04] barren land. Well, let's just throw the
[1:25:06] salt there.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. WHEN CHRIST THREW HIS SALT
[1:25:11] OF HIS word inside of me. Amen. I was a
[1:25:14] dried up well with bitter waters and a
[1:25:16] barren land. AND I WAS NOT producing the
[1:25:18] fruit of THE SPIRIT. I WAS NOT GIVING
[1:25:20] back to him the fruit. It was a barren
[1:25:22] land. But he knew it was good land. It
[1:25:24] just needed healed. So what did HE DO?
[1:25:26] HE SENT A CRUISE OF SALT MY WAY AND A
[1:25:28] BROTHER WHO HAD THE WORD. AND HE THROW
[1:25:30] SOME SALT INSIDE OF MY OLD SPRING. AND
[1:25:32] HE HEALED THE WATERS. HE HEALED IT. AND
[1:25:35] NOW THE BARREN LAND BEGAN TO PRODUCE THE
[1:25:37] LIFE OF CHRIST, THE FRUITS OF THE
[1:25:39] SPIRIT.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. AMEN. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE
[1:25:43] FOR, FRIENDS. FOR PRESERVATION, FOR
[1:25:45] LIFE. AMEN. THERE'S A THERE'S TONS OF
[1:25:48] PEOPLE WHO WILL REJECT. THOSE WHO will
[1:25:50] who will sign their own death warrant by
[1:25:52] rejecting JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. BUT THAT'S
[1:25:54] NOT WHAT I'M HERE FOR. I'M HERE FOR
[1:25:56] LIFE. I'M HERE FOR PRESERVATION. I'M
[1:25:58] HERE TO CARRY CHRIST AROUND THIS WORLD
[1:26:00] FOR whosoever will.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; And if he puts you in an old bitter
[1:26:05] well,
[1:26:08] if he puts YOU IN A WORKPLACE, A FAMILY
[1:26:10] SITUATION, a relationship, A CO-ORKER,
[1:26:13] WHATEVER, WHEREVER HE PLACES YOU, AMEN.
[1:26:15] HE'S GOT THE RIGHT TO THROW THE SALT
[1:26:17] WHEREVER HE WANTS the healing to take
[1:26:19] place.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; It can be rejected. It can be cast out.
[1:26:24] That's fine. But where it's received,
[1:26:26] there'll be healing.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham goes on to say in John
[1:26:32] 8, "Then spake Jesus." I'm going to
[1:26:35] repeat this uh scripture. Oh no, not
[1:26:38] this one. I'm going to repeat the next
[1:26:39] one. Sorry. Then spake Jesus again unto
[1:26:41] them, saying, I am the light of the
[1:26:44] world. He that follows me shall not walk
[1:26:46] in darkness but shall but shall have the
[1:26:51] light of life.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; He didn't say listen. He says I am the
[1:27:01] light of the world.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; So who's the light of the world? Jesus
[1:27:05] Christ.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; He that followeth me shall not walk in
[1:27:10] darkness but shall walk in the light.
[1:27:14] No, that's true, but that's not what he
[1:27:16] said.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; But shall have
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; the light of life.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Not just walk in it, but have it.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; That's why Peter could say at the gate
[1:27:29] called beautiful to the lame man, Amen.
[1:27:31] Gold and silver have I none, but such as
[1:27:33] I have.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; He had something in him that could bring
[1:27:37] life, that could heal that old dried up
[1:27:40] well, that barren land. He had a life
[1:27:42] inside of him. him and he had a promise.
[1:27:44] He had the word and he had the anointing
[1:27:45] of the Holy Ghost. Amen. And he says,
[1:27:47] "Such as I have, I give unto you. In the
[1:27:49] name of Jesus Christ, rise up and walk."
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Listen, that wasn't
[1:27:56] just written. Amen. For 2,000 years ago,
[1:27:58] just for Peter. He's the same yesterday,
[1:28:00] today, and forever. Amen. You have
[1:28:02] something. There's something in you.
[1:28:04] He's given you the light of life.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; I want to repeat this scripture that I
[1:28:10] just read. Matthew 5, ye are the salt of
[1:28:15] the earth,
[1:28:16] but if the salt have lost his savior,
[1:28:19] wherewith shall it be salted?
[1:28:21] Listen, you're the salt of the earth,
[1:28:24] but but listen, if you don't live the
[1:28:26] life of Christ,
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; WHO ELSE WILL?
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; If you DON'T LIVE THIS MESSAGE, who's
[1:28:35] going to live it?
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen that there there's only a
[1:28:40] limited number of people on the planet
[1:28:42] that have ears to ear hear and eyes to
[1:28:45] see
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; and you hear and you see. If you WON'T
[1:28:49] BE SALTY, WHO WILL? [screaming]
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; IF YOU WON'T BECOME A SAVIOR, IF YOU
[1:28:54] WON'T BECOME LIFE INTO THIS WORLD, WHO
[1:28:56] IS IT GOING TO COME THROUGH? WHO ELSE IS
[1:28:58] GOING TO DO IT? WE KNOW THAT THE CHURCH
[1:29:00] SYSTEMS HAS WENT INTO ABSOLUTE APOSTASY.
[1:29:03] THERE'S NO LIGHT THERE. THERE'S NO LIGHT
[1:29:04] THERE. IF THERE'S GOING TO BE LIGHT, IF
[1:29:06] THERE'S GOING TO BE LIFE, IT'S GOING TO
[1:29:08] COME THROUGH HIS BODY.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; If life is going to come, what's it
[1:29:16] going to come from?
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; IF THE WATER OF LIFE IS GOING TO SPRING
[1:29:19] FORTH, AMEN, IT'S GOING TO COME. IF
[1:29:21] WE'LL DRINK THE WATER OF LIFE, AMEN.
[1:29:23] WE'LL BECOME A LIVING WELL, AMEN,
[1:29:24] FLOWING OUT WATERS INTO ETERNAL LIFE.
[1:29:26] WHERE IS THAT WELL GOING TO BE? WHERE
[1:29:28] ELSE WILL YOU FIND IT? YOU'RE ONLY GOING
[1:29:30] TO FIND IT IN THE BRIDE OF Jesus Christ
[1:29:32] and the elect predestinated bride for
[1:29:35] this day. SHE'S WHERE THE WATER'S
[1:29:37] FLOWING. SHE'S WHERE THE LIGHT IS
[1:29:38] SHINING. SHE'S WHERE THE SALT is
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; because he predestinated it that way. He
[1:29:44] called for it that way.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; And if we won't do it, who will?
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; If the salt has lost his savor,
[1:29:53] wherewith shall it be salted?
[1:29:57] Listen.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we don't have lifegiving power,
[1:30:04] where else outside the message are we
[1:30:06] going to be resulted?
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Where else outside of this word are we
[1:30:13] going to get life? Where we going to be
[1:30:15] revived? Where are we going to get
[1:30:17] light? WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GET WATER?
[1:30:18] WHERE where's it going to come from?
[1:30:20] Yeah.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; It is henceforth good for nothing but to
[1:30:27] be cast out and be trodden underf foot
[1:30:29] of men.
[1:30:30] Now he says ye
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; are the light of the world.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; I thought he said he was the light of
[1:30:38] the world
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; and I say amen.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; And he said ye are the light of the
[1:30:43] world and I say amen.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; I think it's the same thing as salt. The
[1:30:47] salt is Christ. The light is Christ.
[1:30:49] Listen, the light is not Chad Lamb born
[1:30:53] of my MOM AND DAD. THAT'S not it. Amen.
[1:30:55] But God predestinates something to be
[1:30:58] manifest inside that tabernacle. And
[1:31:00] that something he wants to manifest as a
[1:31:02] part of himself. And he provided his own
[1:31:04] life in this day. And the word for for
[1:31:06] which me to emulate. AND NOW THAT
[1:31:08] BECOMES LIGHT. THAT BECOMES SALT. THAT
[1:31:11] BECOMES THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST ON
[1:31:12] DISPLAY. THAT BECOMES GOD EXPRESSING
[1:31:15] HIMSELF.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; And I CAN ONLY DO A PART. BUT YOU'VE GOT
[1:31:19] A PART AND EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD
[1:31:21] THAT'S THE BRIDE OF CHRIST HAS A PART
[1:31:22] AND TOGETHER COLLECTIVELY they
[1:31:24] expressing the full life of Jesus
[1:31:26] Christ.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; AND IF IT'S NOT THERE, I ASK YOU, WHERE
[1:31:30] ELSE IS IT?
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Where else will you find it? If it's not
[1:31:35] in this message,
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; WHERE WILL YOU GET LIGHT? WHERE WILL YOU
[1:31:38] GET WATER? WHERE WILL YOU GET SALT?
[1:31:40] WHERE WILL YOU GET IT OUTSIDE THE LIGHT
[1:31:43] OF THE AGE? THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; SO, I think we have a responsibility
[1:31:49] to let our light shine.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Let this gospel shine. Amen. The light
[1:31:55] is not here to be overcome by darkness.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; The light here is to push back the
[1:32:00] darkness.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; So that wherever you go, darkness is
[1:32:04] abaded.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; And listen, don't don't get some comic
[1:32:08] book superhero idea of this.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we get so confused in the
[1:32:13] simplicity of the life of Christ and an
[1:32:16] average run-of-the-mill everyday human
[1:32:18] being,
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; And we get some super notions of some uh
[1:32:24] uh uh comic book and I don't even know
[1:32:26] kids know what comic book is, but I
[1:32:28] don't know what else to call it. Some
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; whatever these things you go into
[1:32:31] Walmart and you see these superhero
[1:32:33] people and they they can do whatever
[1:32:35] they can do. I don't know. Shoot
[1:32:37] fireballs out of their hand.
[1:32:39] [laughter]
[1:32:40] Well, that would be great. When somebody
[1:32:42] wants the Holy Ghost, I'll shoot a
[1:32:43] fireball out of my hand.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; That's not it, friends. That's not the
[1:32:47] light we shine. That's not it. It's
[1:32:49] living the word. The simplicity of a man
[1:32:52] respecting his wife, a wife honoring her
[1:32:54] husband, children obeying their parents.
[1:32:56] Amen. The simplicity of a sister looking
[1:32:59] like a feminine Christian woman. Amen. A
[1:33:01] brother. Amen. Comfortable in
[1:33:03] masculinity. This this picture of the
[1:33:05] message painted for us of what a man is
[1:33:07] and what a woman is. WHAT IS THAT?
[1:33:09] SHINING LIGHT. AMEN. Testifying of God's
[1:33:12] goodness, sharing of the healing of God.
[1:33:13] Amen. Just living your life, BUT LIVING
[1:33:16] YOUR LIFE FOR CHRIST, LIVING YOUR LIFE
[1:33:18] in the word, surrendered completely to
[1:33:21] the word, AND CONFESSING THE WORD.
[1:33:23] THAT'S shining the light.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; DON'T DON'T EVER END A DAY AND SAY, "I
[1:33:28] DIDN'T do anything today." your very
[1:33:30] existence on earth, the way you carry
[1:33:32] yourself, your demeanor, the way you
[1:33:34] clothe yourself, the way you treat other
[1:33:35] human beings, it can be an expression of
[1:33:37] Jesus Christ.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Because that's what the WORD CAME TO DO.
[1:33:41] CHANGE US. AMEN. from just a
[1:33:43] run-of-the-mill HUMAN BEING INTO A LIGHT
[1:33:45] a lightgiving resource, a life-giving
[1:33:48] resource, a a carrier of the life of
[1:33:51] Jesus Christ
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; in whatever form you're in, in whatever
[1:33:55] position you're in, in whatever station
[1:33:57] life God's placed you, and wherever he
[1:33:59] takes you.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; So, don't compare with another brother.
[1:34:03] That brother witnessed to 15 people. He
[1:34:06] had the whole airplane on their knees.
[1:34:08] Well, that was wonderful. I thank God
[1:34:09] that he did that. BUT MAYBE YOU'RE NOT
[1:34:10] GOING TO RIDE in an airplane. And maybe
[1:34:12] you don't get that privilege, but it
[1:34:13] doesn't MEAN YOU'RE NOT SALT and you're
[1:34:15] not light AND YOU'RE NOT HERE FOR LIFE.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; TO EVERYONE YOU COME IN CONTACT WITH, TO
[1:34:20] EVERYWHERE YOU GO, LET THE LIGHT PUSH
[1:34:22] BACK THE DARKNESS. YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S
[1:34:24] LIKE WHEN A WOMAN DRESSES LIKE A WOMAN,
[1:34:26] LOOKS like a lady, and carries a
[1:34:27] feminine nature about her. IT'S PUSHING
[1:34:29] BACK ALL KINDS OF LEODYSIAN DARKNESS
[1:34:32] EVERYWHERE SHE GOES. She doesn't have to
[1:34:35] stand up and preach on a soapbox. SHE'S
[1:34:37] PREACHING EVERY STEP SHE TAKES WHEN SHE
[1:34:39] KEEPS HERSELF in her feminine appeal and
[1:34:41] her character OF A CHRISTIAN LADY.
[1:34:43] EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT SHE IS.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; THERE'S BEEN A FEW TIMES IN MY LIFE I'VE
[1:34:49] HAD PEOPLE COME UP to me and say,
[1:34:50] "You're a Christian, aren't you?"
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; A few times
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; when I've been by myself,
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; but there's been dozens of times when
[1:34:59] I'm with my wife and my girls, they say,
[1:35:00] "What church do you go to?"
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; IT'S A GIVEN. YOU'RE SERVING CHRIST. AN
[1:35:05] ABSOLUTE GIVEN. THEY JUST KNOW IT.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T ASK, "ARE YOU A CHRISTIAN?"
[1:35:10] THEY SAY, "WHAT CHURCH DO you go to?"
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; We're here to live a life surrender to
[1:35:18] the word and let the light shine.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; For what?
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; For life.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:26] Because
[1:35:28] the moment you remove the bride from
[1:35:30] this earth,
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; there is no hope for the Gentiles.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; The only hope is through two wi two two
[1:35:39] witnesses, two prophets that are going
[1:35:40] to the 144,000. And of all the preaching
[1:35:43] and of all the signs and all the
[1:35:44] miracles they do, only 144,000 will
[1:35:48] believe them.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; They will do signs and wonders like was
[1:35:52] done in the Exodus journey like Moses
[1:35:54] did. Amen. before Pharaoh thousands of
[1:35:56] years ago. Same kind of signs with the
[1:35:58] same kind of power. And no matter what
[1:36:00] they do, only 144,000 will believe.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Nobody else in the world. And no
[1:36:07] Gentiles.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; The only hope for the Gentiles is the
[1:36:11] fact that the bride is still here.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Ye are the light of the world.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Ye are the salt of the earth.
[1:36:23] Don't diminish your life because you
[1:36:26] never traveled to Africa to preach.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Don't become subbride. [snorts]
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Don't ever do that, friends.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Because you're light in your life. If
[1:36:41] you've got Christ living in you, you are
[1:36:43] salt and you are light.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Every day, everywhere, in every
[1:36:49] circumstance.
[1:36:51] Don't let the devil diminish that in our
[1:36:53] minds because that's what Christ said we
[1:36:56] were. And if he said it, I believe it.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; He says in John 12, Jesus said unto
[1:37:03] them, "Yet a little while is the light
[1:37:05] with you. Walk while you have the light,
[1:37:08] lest darkness come upon you. For he that
[1:37:10] walketh in darkness knoweth not whether
[1:37:12] he goeth. While you have light, believe
[1:37:15] in the light, that you may be the
[1:37:17] children of light."
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:21] Ye are the light of the world.
[1:37:24] When the rapture culminates in the
[1:37:26] change of the body, we're gone. The
[1:37:28] light will have left the world for the
[1:37:31] Gentiles.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; So I say, God, make me a lighthouse.
[1:37:38] Yes. Amen.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; God, help me not to be under a bushel
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; or under a bed,
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; but help me to live a life that shines
[1:37:49] your light.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; The areas of compromise in my life,
[1:37:54] Lord, take them out.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; The places that I know that I'm not
[1:37:59] fully surrendered, help me, Lord Jesus.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Help me to shine that light. Help me to
[1:38:07] cleanse my lens. Let me not get all
[1:38:10] carboned up and smoked up, but Lord,
[1:38:12] send your Holy Ghost today to do a
[1:38:14] cleansing of my lamp.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; May my lamp be trimmed and clear
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; because where else is there going to be
[1:38:21] light?
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Where else is the light going to shine?
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; There's darkness on the earth and gross
[1:38:29] darkness upon the people.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Can anybody testify that that's the age
[1:38:34] we live in?
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a darkness on the earth
[1:38:36] and gross darkness. But brother Brandham
[1:38:39] said the light pushes back the darkness.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; That's why when you come in contact with
[1:38:44] certain people, they change their
[1:38:46] demeanor.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Some for the better, some for the worse,
[1:38:50] but they always change.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Because they're coming in contact with
[1:38:55] light and life and saw and there's a
[1:38:57] reaction.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Learn to trust it. Learn to believe in
[1:39:02] it. Learn to go to work and say, "Lord,
[1:39:04] let me let me go as a lamp burning your
[1:39:06] light in this place today.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Let me contact people. Let me shine
[1:39:11] light." You can't make people come to
[1:39:13] the light, but you can shine the light.
[1:39:15] And when you come in contact with
[1:39:16] somebody, the reason they react to your
[1:39:18] light into your life, sometimes it's
[1:39:19] just pushing back the darkness a little
[1:39:21] bit from their life because the light
[1:39:22] pushes back the darkness.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; And you come in contact with some people
[1:39:27] and then all of a sudden they begin to
[1:39:28] say the oddest things to you.
[1:39:31] I used to go to church when I was a
[1:39:32] little boy.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; It's like, why did they say that to me?
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Because the light of the life of Christ
[1:39:39] is pushing the darkness off of their
[1:39:41] life.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; And they're starting to see clearly for
[1:39:44] the first time in who knows how long.
[1:39:47] They're starting to think about God.
[1:39:49] Consider God. Consider what you've got.
[1:39:51] And they know there's a difference.
[1:39:52] Listen, don't don't lose the value of
[1:39:55] what God has given to us and who we are.
[1:39:57] AND THERE'S LIGHT AND THERE'S LIFE AND
[1:39:59] THERE'S A CRUISE OF SALT AND IT'S ON THE
[1:40:01] EARTH.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE'S STILL EMANUEL. HE'S
[1:40:04] STILL GOD WITH US. AMEN. FOR US, HE'S IN
[1:40:07] US. AMEN. BUT FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD,
[1:40:09] HE'S WITH US. AMEN. HE'S HERE ON THE
[1:40:11] EARTH IN A MANY MEMBERED BRIDE.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; THEY CAN STILL TOUCH THE HEM OF HIS
[1:40:16] GARMENT. THEY CAN STILL APPROACH UNTO
[1:40:17] HIM. WHY? BECAUSE HIS BODY IS STILL
[1:40:19] HERE.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. He says this. He says, "For you
[1:40:26] were sometimes darkness, but now are you
[1:40:29] light in the Lord. Walk as children of
[1:40:32] the light."
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Listen, don't be ashamed of this
[1:40:34] message. Don't be ashamed of this
[1:40:35] gospel. Don't be ashamed of the
[1:40:37] standard. Don't be ashamed
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; of the word.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; If somebody says, "Why do you do that?"
[1:40:43] Say, "The word says
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; WHY?" BECAUSE THAT'S LIGHT.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; THAT'S LIFE.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Brother Bam says this in Christ is
[1:40:52] the mystery. says, ' And when the world
[1:40:55] word moves on down into the body, from
[1:40:57] the head, what is it? The same word.
[1:40:59] Nothing can be added or taken from it.
[1:41:01] So the same word moves from the head as
[1:41:03] the day comes close. Down into the body,
[1:41:06] down into the body, vindicating that
[1:41:07] they are one. They are husband and wife.
[1:41:10] They are flesh of his flesh, word of his
[1:41:12] word, life of his life, spirit of his
[1:41:14] spirit. See? Amen. How do you know it?
[1:41:17] Bears the same record, same fruit, same
[1:41:20] word. See, manifest Christ. Same life,
[1:41:23] same God, same spirit, same word, same
[1:41:27] book. Amen. Same signs. Hey, listen.
[1:41:29] Don't be afraid to pray for your
[1:41:31] co-workers
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; cuz it's the same life. We want to do
[1:41:34] the same work. Amen. DON'T BE AFRAID TO
[1:41:37] SAY, "I'M GOING TO PRAY FOR you and
[1:41:38] let's see what God will do for you."
[1:41:40] Amen. And let some light shine in their
[1:41:41] life. LET SOME SALT TOUCH their old
[1:41:43] water.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:49] Same signs. things that I do shall you
[1:41:51] also. Oh, hallelujah. My notice the
[1:41:54] vindicated word in his body is his
[1:41:57] victory and the reason of his death.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; What does that mean? Amen. He wants to
[1:42:03] live his life in the full power of his
[1:42:05] life in you.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Whatever he did, he wants to do IN HIS
[1:42:08] BODY. AMEN. IT DOESN'T MEAN ONE PERSON
[1:42:10] will do everything, but it means the
[1:42:12] body will HAVE THE FULL LIFE OF Jesus
[1:42:14] Christ because he's the same yesterday,
[1:42:15] today, and forever. And if you've got
[1:42:17] that teaspoon out of the ocean, that
[1:42:19] means the full potential of the life of
[1:42:21] Christ IS IN YOU. WHATEVER HE CALLS FOR
[1:42:23] CAN COME FORTH.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; If it's walking on water, if it's
[1:42:26] speaking TO A STORM, WHATEVER IT IS, IT
[1:42:28] CAN COME FORTH because it's the same
[1:42:30] life.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; So shine light, live life, don't be
[1:42:36] afraid to intercede because that we're
[1:42:38] kings and priests.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; We are kings AND PRIESTS UNTO GOD. WHAT
[1:42:42] IS A PRIEST? AN INTERCESSOR. WHO ARE WE
[1:42:44] GOING TO INTERCEDE FOR? AMEN. THERE'S A
[1:42:46] WHOLE WORLD TRAPPED IN DARKNESS THAT
[1:42:48] NEEDS INTERCESSION. THERE'S PEOPLE WE
[1:42:50] KNOW EVERY DAY. THEY NEED SOMEBODY TO
[1:42:52] stand in the gap AND SAY, "OH, GOD,
[1:42:53] THEY'RE TRAPPED IN IGNORANCE. THEY'RE
[1:42:55] STUCK IN DARKNESS. They don't know WHAT
[1:42:56] THEY'RE DOING. WOULD YOU PLEASE HEAL
[1:42:58] them and deliver them and open their
[1:42:59] eyes?"
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's do the work of intercession.
[1:43:05] Friends, let's realize that Christ is
[1:43:09] here.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; He's here in his bride universal.
[1:43:16] And this quote, I want to read this next
[1:43:18] quote to you. I love it. We're we're
[1:43:21] coming down to the close. We're almost
[1:43:22] done. But I want to read this. Brother
[1:43:25] Bam starts talking about the old
[1:43:27] Dutchman who went to work after he went
[1:43:29] to revival and got saved and he couldn't
[1:43:32] pronounce all his words just right. And
[1:43:34] but he got saved and they made fun of
[1:43:36] him at work. And this is what he said.
[1:43:38] He said, "You must have went down to
[1:43:40] that bunch of nuts." He said, "Yes."
[1:43:42] Said, "Glory to God." said, "Thank God
[1:43:44] for the nuts."
[1:43:46] He said, "You know, you take an
[1:43:48] automobile coming down the road and you
[1:43:50] take all the nuts out of it, you ain't
[1:43:52] got nothing but a bunch of yunk."
[1:43:55] [laughter]
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. But what the little
[1:44:00] Dutchman was just about right.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Take all the nuts out. The nuts is what
[1:44:04] holds it together. And I think that what
[1:44:08] holds the church together sometimes and
[1:44:11] holds civilization together.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; What's going to happen to this world
[1:44:17] when you take all the nuts out?
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; It's going to fall apart.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; The antichrist becism will sweep in. A
[1:44:25] tribulation will fall in so fast and the
[1:44:27] whole world will change dynamically
[1:44:29] overnight.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you took the nuts out. what
[1:44:34] was holding civilization together.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:44:40] you're not just
[1:44:43] another lump of flesh walking on this
[1:44:45] earth.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; You are a son or daughter of almighty
[1:44:48] God.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; You may be in your birth average or
[1:44:54] below average.
[1:44:56] You may be in natural abilities.
[1:44:59] You may be in the top 10% of the lower
[1:45:01] third.
[1:45:05] It's nice if you say it that way because
[1:45:06] at least you say top 10%.
[1:45:09] Sounds better and intelligence and in
[1:45:12] charisma and in memory and and all the
[1:45:15] things that Listen, don't look at those
[1:45:18] things.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; You arise. [snorts] Rise up from the
[1:45:24] dead denomination. Rise up from the old
[1:45:26] dry bones of Ezekiel. You rise up and
[1:45:28] shine.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. because your light has come and he
[1:45:32] is your light.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; He is your bridegroom. He is your
[1:45:35] husband and the glory of the Lord is
[1:45:37] shining on you.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Arise and shine for his light has come
[1:45:42] and is shining upon you. Amen. And the
[1:45:44] glory of the Lord shall be seen on you.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Go forward every day knowing who you
[1:45:51] are. God does not want us to live a
[1:45:53] defeated life. And it doesn't mean, like
[1:45:55] I said, it doesn't mean Marvel comic
[1:45:58] superhero going through and demolishing.
[1:46:00] No, that's not it. Amen. We defeat the
[1:46:02] devil by not giving in to the devil.
[1:46:04] Amen. We make him run away by ignoring
[1:46:06] him.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Not by screaming at him and yelling at
[1:46:09] him. Just don't pay any attention to
[1:46:10] anything he says and KEEP LIVING THE
[1:46:12] WORD. THAT destroys the devilise.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Just keep manifesting the word. Keep
[1:46:18] declaring the word. LET IT BE ON YOU.
[1:46:21] Let it shine from you. Amen. Let it be
[1:46:23] in your lips. Let it be in your actions.
[1:46:25] Let it be in your home. Let it be all
[1:46:27] over you. And anything that hinders any
[1:46:29] darkness, ANY COMPROMISE, KILL THAT
[1:46:31] THING. SAY, "GOD, HELP ME TO KILL THE
[1:46:32] compromise that's IN MY LIFE." BECAUSE
[1:46:34] I'VE GOT A JOB TO DO ON THIS EARTH. I'VE
[1:46:36] GOT SALT TO GIVE. I GOT CONTACT TO MAKE.
[1:46:39] I GOT LIGHT TO SHINE.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; And the devil wants to diminish your
[1:46:44] light. And he wants to remove your salt
[1:46:46] from the equation. Because when you come
[1:46:48] on the SCENE WITH THE POWER THAT'S
[1:46:50] INSIDE OF YOU, WITH the word that's been
[1:46:51] given to you, you have the word and the
[1:46:54] spirit TO BACK IT UP TO CHANGE the
[1:46:56] circumstances.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; In every situation if the spirit of God
[1:47:00] moves on you to do so.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; So what would the devil want you to do?
[1:47:05] Doubt who you are. Get stuck in
[1:47:07] compromise. Be afraid to speak because
[1:47:09] I've already spoken so many wrong things
[1:47:11] they won't believe me now.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Ruin my testimony at work. Ruin my
[1:47:15] testimony at school. That's what he's
[1:47:17] trying to do, friends.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Because he can't stop the light. It
[1:47:21] pushes back the darkness.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; How do we live this magnificent life of
[1:47:28] the bride of Jesus Christ?
[1:47:30] Surrender to the word.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Just let the word flow in us.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; And the areas that we're struggling with
[1:47:38] and the places that are hard for us and
[1:47:40] the things that we fell in, just cry out
[1:47:42] to God.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to stop making excuses and
[1:47:46] say, "Well, that's just me and this and
[1:47:48] that my the I see these other brothers
[1:47:50] doing. If they can do it, I can."
[1:47:51] Listen, let's stop making excuses and
[1:47:53] just say, "God, I believe this is
[1:47:54] hindering your expression. Would you
[1:47:56] come and take it out of me, Lord, in my
[1:47:58] humanity and what I got from mom and dad
[1:48:01] or whatever it is I've done or said,
[1:48:03] I've got these trappings all around me.
[1:48:04] God, would you come and remove them from
[1:48:06] me? I want to shine the light. I want to
[1:48:08] be the salt. I want to do something for
[1:48:10] your kingdom.
[1:48:14] Because if you don't, who will?
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Who's going to do it?
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; There's one place where his life is
[1:48:21] dwelling. There's one place that he's
[1:48:23] bottled and confined.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; And where is he bottled and confined
[1:48:27] today? He bottled himself and confined
[1:48:30] himself in his bride.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; In an invisible union with Christ.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Let's shine for him.
[1:48:41] Brother Brandham says this.
[1:48:45] Notice like the sculpture, he hides with
[1:48:47] a mask over it. That's what God has done
[1:48:49] to this age. It's been hid. All these
[1:48:52] things has been hid and it's supposed to
[1:48:54] be revealed in this age. Now, the Bible
[1:48:56] says that will be revealed in the latter
[1:48:57] times. It's like a sculptor keeping his
[1:48:59] piece of work all covered over until the
[1:49:01] time he takes the mask off of it. And
[1:49:04] there it is. All that's what the Bible
[1:49:06] has been. It has been a work of God
[1:49:08] that's been covered up. And it's been
[1:49:10] hid since the foundation of the world.
[1:49:11] And it's sevenfold mystery. And God
[1:49:13] promised in this day at the age of this
[1:49:16] Leodysian church, he'll take the mask
[1:49:18] off the whole thing. And we could see
[1:49:20] it. He did that at the opening of the
[1:49:21] seals.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; What a glorious thing. God and Morphe.
[1:49:25] That means God in a form. Masked in the
[1:49:28] pillar of fire. God and Morphe and a man
[1:49:31] called Jesus. God and Morphe in his
[1:49:34] church.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; He's still Emanuel. That's right. And
[1:49:38] God is still here. He's on the earth
[1:49:42] because whatever was binding, the Holy
[1:49:45] Ghost has been loosed by the evening
[1:49:48] time message and his life is poured back
[1:49:50] into the church again. What was a
[1:49:53] portion, what was a dip, now is
[1:49:55] fullness.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; God above us, God with us, God in us,
[1:50:00] the condescending of God.
[1:50:04] I want to read one more scripture
[1:50:05] together as the musicians come.
[1:50:10] Matthew 10 40-42,
[1:50:13] he that receiveth you receiveth me.
[1:50:18] Why?
[1:50:20] Because his life is in you.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Because you're his representative on
[1:50:24] earth. Because the light is shining in
[1:50:26] you. Because you're a member of his
[1:50:29] body.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Ye are the salt of the earth. Ye are the
[1:50:34] light of the world.
[1:50:36] He that receiveth you receiveth me. And
[1:50:40] he that receiveth me receiveth him that
[1:50:42] sent me. He that receiveth a prophet in
[1:50:45] the name of a prophet shall receive a
[1:50:47] prophet's reward. And he that receiveth
[1:50:49] a righteous man in the name of a
[1:50:50] righteous man shall receive a righteous
[1:50:52] man's reward. And whosoever shall give
[1:50:55] to drink unto one of these little ones a
[1:50:57] cup of cold water only in the name of a
[1:50:59] disciple, verily I say unto you, he
[1:51:03] shall in no wise lose his reward. Even
[1:51:07] if somebody anybody offers as much as a
[1:51:10] cup of cold water to one of the little
[1:51:12] littlest in the kingdom of God, even
[1:51:14] those who just a disciple, not a
[1:51:16] prophet, not but just a disciple,
[1:51:20] that one who offers to drink to that
[1:51:22] lowly one in Christ, he shall in no wise
[1:51:25] lose his reward.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you realize the impact that our
[1:51:31] life can have if we shine for Christ? If
[1:51:35] we just be who he's meant for us to be,
[1:51:37] be the body of Christ in the world.
[1:51:40] Amen. Moving into the darkness. Listen,
[1:51:42] we don't have to be afraid of the
[1:51:43] darkness. That's
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Why fear what runs from light?
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; The world's getting darker. Absolutely.
[1:51:52] It's prophesied it will. IT'S THE
[1:51:54] BLACKEST IT'S EVER BEEN. ABSOLUTELY.
[1:51:55] IT'S SATAN'S EDEN. ABSOLUTELY. For sure.
[1:51:57] WHY SHOULD THAT SCARE ANY OF US?
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Benham said, "If you go into a
[1:52:01] dark room and YOU LIGHT ONE LITTLE
[1:52:03] LIGHT, AMEN. THAT LITTLE LIGHT WILL
[1:52:05] LIGHT THE WHOLE WORLD. It begins to move
[1:52:06] the darkness away from the light. It
[1:52:08] pushes it away. Amen. You can say,
[1:52:10] "WELL, ALL I'VE GOT IS ONE LITTLE
[1:52:11] LIGHT." WELL, THAT ONE LITTLE LIGHT WILL
[1:52:13] PUSH AWAY DARKNESS WHEREVER YOU GO.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Everywhere you move, the darkness runs
[1:52:17] away from that little light. WE DON'T
[1:52:19] HAVE TO BE AFRAID OF DARKNESS. We don't
[1:52:21] have to be afraid of the evil OF THIS
[1:52:23] WORLD. WHY? Because greater is he that's
[1:52:25] in you than he that's in the world.
[1:52:27] WE'RE NOT AFRAID TO TAKE LIGHT INTO THE
[1:52:29] DARK WORLD. WE'RE NOT AFRAID TO LIVE THE
[1:52:31] LIFE. WE'RE NOT AFRAID TO MANIFEST
[1:52:33] CHRIST. WE'RE NOT AFRAID TO GO TO WHERE
[1:52:34] SALT SOMETIMES DOESN'T WANT TO GO.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; And God might sprinkle you into a
[1:52:40] horrible workplace.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; SAY, "GOD, WHY AM I HERE? DON'T FORGET
[1:52:44] YOUR SALT." MAYBE HE WANTED TO PUT A
[1:52:46] LITTLE PRESERVING SAVING SALT IN THE
[1:52:48] SITUATION TO see if somebody could be
[1:52:50] saved
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; or even offer you a cup of cold water.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; DON'T GET DISCOURAGED. GOD MIGHT DROP
[1:52:57] YOU IN THE MIDST of the darkest of the
[1:52:59] darkest places and situations and you
[1:53:01] think, "THIS IS HORRIBLE. MY SUPERVISOR
[1:53:03] IS EVIL. AMEN. EVERYONE around me is
[1:53:06] doing evil and he drops you in the
[1:53:07] middle and you know by you know you know
[1:53:09] by the will of God that's where you're
[1:53:10] SUPPOSED TO BE. DON'T GET DISCOURAGED.
[1:53:12] YOUR LIGHT WILL PUSH AWAY THE DARKNESS.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; MAYBE THAT'S WHY YOU'RE THERE. LISTEN.
[1:53:19] WHERE IS THE BRIDE COMING TO HER? H HER
[1:53:21] BRIGHTEST LIGHT. WHERE IS SHE SHINING
[1:53:23] THE BRIGHTEST? THE GENTILE BRIDE HAS
[1:53:24] EVER SHINE. SHE'S SHINING THE BRIGHTEST
[1:53:27] IN LEODYSIA WHICH IS THE DARKEST.
[1:53:31] WHY WOULD HE PUT HIS WHY WOULD HE PUT
[1:53:34] HIS FULL MANIFESTATION in bride FORM AT
[1:53:36] THE END WHEN IT'S THE WORST? THAT'S the
[1:53:38] point.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; He Elisha put the salt in the bad spring
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; and made it good.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; He didn't put it in the good spring.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; He put it in the bad spring and made it
[1:53:54] sweet.
[1:53:56] God can put us in all kinds of bad
[1:53:58] situations, but let him make it sweet.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, I I want to stop crying. Woe is me.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Why am I here?
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Why is this happening? Has anybody else
[1:54:11] said that?
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; As if God didn't know.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; As if he made a mistake. You say things
[1:54:19] like, "Why am I here? And why is this
[1:54:21] happening to me? And why and I don't
[1:54:23] understand." Listen, it's okay not to
[1:54:24] understand. And it's okay to question.
[1:54:26] It's okay to be heartbroken. But listen,
[1:54:27] don't forget that the footsteps of the
[1:54:29] righteous are order to the Lord.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; And you're not here, AMEN, JUST TO SIT
[1:54:35] IN A convent somewhere or come to
[1:54:37] fellowship and enjoy one another and get
[1:54:39] in each other's light and feel THE WARM
[1:54:41] GLOW. THAT'S NOT OUR ONLY PURPOSE.
[1:54:43] THAT'S PART OF OUR purpose and we thank
[1:54:44] God FOR IT. BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE OUT
[1:54:46] OUT WHERE SALT'S NEEDED AND WHERE LIGHT
[1:54:49] is needed.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; That's why we don't come into communal
[1:54:52] living. THAT'S WHY WE DIDN'T START A
[1:54:53] COMMUNE. And that's why brother Brown
[1:54:54] didn't tell us sell everything you own
[1:54:56] and move OUT HERE. NO, YOU GO TO YOUR
[1:54:58] WORKPLACES, GO TO your family functions,
[1:54:59] go to all of these places.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; And be salt and light.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; And if they call you a nut,
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; and if they call you a religious nut,
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; say, "Praise God."
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; You don't know if this nut was gone,
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; The whole world would fall apart.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; You might be the nut that's holding your
[1:55:21] family together.
[1:55:23] You might be the nut that's holding your
[1:55:25] workplace together.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; There might be blessings coming to your
[1:55:29] co-workers and to your place of
[1:55:30] employment just because you're there.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Everywhere Joseph went, he prospered
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; in Piper's house and in prison to the
[1:55:43] right. Why? Because there was a blessing
[1:55:45] attached to his life.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Is there a blessing attached to our
[1:55:50] life? I believe so. Let's move forward
[1:55:54] and not fear the darkness and not get
[1:55:56] upset at the situations and not lose
[1:55:58] heart when salt gets thrown into a bad
[1:56:00] situation.
[1:56:02] This is a pot of [snorts] yucky food.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Let's add some salt and see if we can
[1:56:06] make it a little bit better.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; And let God do it.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Let's recognize that God's still here.
[1:56:17] You know, sometimes I need a good dose
[1:56:19] of God.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; And that's why I need you.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; There's times my life needs a little
[1:56:25] salt and sometimes I need you.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; I need a little bit of light on my
[1:56:30] situation. Your fellowship helps me and
[1:56:32] our fellowship together helps one
[1:56:34] another. And I thank God we can
[1:56:36] recognize Emanuel's still here.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. He promised to be with us always
[1:56:41] and he'll never leave us and forsake us
[1:56:43] and that he will not leave us
[1:56:45] comfortless but come to us and I believe
[1:56:47] it friends.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all. Let's just
[1:56:51] pray. Lord, we thank you for your word.
[1:56:54] And God, may it be more than the
[1:56:57] preaching of a sermon,
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; but God, may it be a realization that
[1:57:02] strikes us deeper than it ever has
[1:57:03] before.
[1:57:05] May we realize, Lord, we're not here,
[1:57:08] Lord, just to trudge through life and
[1:57:11] barely make it, get to the other side,
[1:57:15] Lord, exhausted, exasperated by life.
[1:57:19] That's not why you put us here, Lord.
[1:57:21] You put us here and you raised your
[1:57:24] light to shine on us and you told us to
[1:57:27] arise and shine.
[1:57:29] God, you want to express yourself. And
[1:57:32] in this dispensation of time, you've
[1:57:34] chosen to express yourself in bride form
[1:57:37] in a many membered body.
[1:57:40] And God, we believe we're members of
[1:57:42] that body. And we want you to have a
[1:57:45] greater expression in us than ever
[1:57:47] before. God, use us as salt. Use us as
[1:57:51] light. Help us, God, to be set on a
[1:57:54] lampstand on a hill so that the light
[1:57:57] will shine. [music]
[1:57:59] And Father, forgive us for compromises
[1:58:01] we've made. Forgive us for bad attitudes
[1:58:04] that we've had towards other people,
[1:58:07] co-workers, other humans that are
[1:58:09] trapped in darkness. But God, may we
[1:58:12] realize that we never walk alone, but
[1:58:15] wherever we go, your light is shining.
[1:58:18] God, that we're a vessel carrying your
[1:58:20] salt. Lord, may we may we recognize that
[1:58:22] you're in us. You're with us into the
[1:58:25] end of the world, the end of this age.
[1:58:28] And God, there's no other nuts. There's
[1:58:30] no other salt. There's no other light.
[1:58:32] There's no other place
[1:58:34] for hope to be found. God, help us to
[1:58:37] stay engaged and stay loving. God, help
[1:58:40] us to shine light wherever we go. And
[1:58:43] may we give our lives to you Aresh day
[1:58:45] by day. Use us for your glory. May the
[1:58:48] reality of these things be ever before
[1:58:51] our eyes. We love you and we ask for
[1:58:53] your blessing over all that we say and
[1:58:56] do. May we go from here, Lord, realizing
[1:58:59] what we are in this world. And may it
[1:59:01] make us humble and reflecting and
[1:59:03] careful and circumspect [music] about
[1:59:06] the way we walk in this life. We love
[1:59:08] you. We ask that you would bless these
[1:59:10] words. May they produce life. May they
[1:59:13] bring life. In Jesus Christ's name we
[1:59:15] pray. Amen.
[1:59:18] Man, Bridge,
[1:59:21] I've got a river of life flowing out
[1:59:25] from me. [music]
[1:59:27] It makes a lane [singing] to walk and

[1:59:34] doors and [singing] sets the captives

[2:00:42] flow out through me. [music and singing]
[2:00:45] Spring up a well,
[2:00:47] set others free. [music]
[2:00:49] Oh yes, I got a light flowing [singing]
[2:00:53] out from me. It makes [music]
[2:00:57] you walk in the line to see it open.

[2:01:09] [singing] from me.

[2:09:44] Father
[2:09:46] [singing] make

[2:09:51] [music]
[2:09:53] that

[2:09:57] thy
[2:10:00] [music and singing] son
[2:10:09] [music and singing]
[2:10:12] and Empty
[2:10:14] and [music] broken.
[2:10:17] I came [singing]
[2:10:18] back to him. [music]
[2:10:22] A vessel [singing]
[2:10:24] unworthy.
[2:10:27] So scared, [singing]
[2:10:29] [music]
[2:10:31] but he did not
[2:10:34] despair. [music]
[2:10:36] He started [singing]
[2:10:37] over
[2:10:39] again.
[2:10:41] And [singing and music] I bless the
[2:10:43] name.
[2:10:45] He didn't throw the flame away
[2:10:49] [singing and music]
[2:10:51] over
[2:10:53] and over. [music]
[2:10:55] He molds me and makes [singing] me
[2:11:00] [music] into
[2:11:02] his likeness.
[2:11:04] He fashioned [music and singing] into
[2:11:06] the
[2:11:09] vessel
[2:11:11] of [singing]
[2:11:14] high [music]
[2:11:19] [singing]
[2:11:20] because Jesus
[2:11:23] didn't throw [music]
[2:11:24] the away
[2:11:27] and [singing] he is the potter
[2:11:32] and I
[2:11:34] is [music]
[2:11:37] holding [singing]
[2:11:39] his image.
[2:11:41] He wants me [music] to stay. But when I
[2:11:46] stumble and when I [singing] fall
[2:11:50] in my [music]
[2:11:53] grace,
[2:11:54] he [singing] just picks up all the
[2:11:57] [music] pieces. He never throws the clay
[2:12:02] away.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; over
[2:12:06] and over.
[2:12:08] He holds me
[2:12:11] and makes me
[2:12:13] into [music and singing]
[2:12:15] his life.
[2:12:17] He fashions
[2:12:19] the [singing and music] way
[2:12:22] of vessel
[2:12:24] of [singing]
[2:12:27] high
[2:12:29] [music]
[2:12:31] fall [singing]
[2:12:32] because Jesus [music]
[2:12:35] didn't throw the clay away [singing]
[2:12:40] [music]
[2:12:40] over
[2:12:42] and over.
[2:12:44] He molds [singing] me and makes me
[2:12:49] into [music]
[2:12:51] his light.
[2:12:53] He fashions [music and singing]
[2:12:55] this clay
[2:12:58] a vessel [singing]
[2:13:00] of honor
[2:13:03] I am today. [music]
[2:13:07] And it's all [singing]
[2:13:08] because Jesus [music]
[2:13:11] didn't throw the clay [singing] away.
