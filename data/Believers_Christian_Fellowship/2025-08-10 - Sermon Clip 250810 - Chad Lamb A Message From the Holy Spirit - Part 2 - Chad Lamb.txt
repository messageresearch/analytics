TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Amen. &gt;&gt; God had to convince Joseph not Mary because now she's carrying the word and God has got to watch over her life. And now there's prophecies that must be fulfilled in her life. And one of those prophecies is that this baby has to be born in the city of David. Well, Mary may not even even understood that. Mary may have heard and been read through I mean the scriptures and it never dawned on her that that was part of the word for her day. But it didn't need to dawn on her because it never left the mind of God. And she was part of the program of God. And God was going to work his program because his life was now injected inside of her. And she didn't have to figure it out. God was going to figure it out. If God had to move the heart of kings, he had to move nations. He had to move people in a census all over the world. Hey, listen. This was a worldwide census. &gt;&gt; God was moving politics. God was moving armies. God was moving uh laws, senators. He was moving. What was he moving it for? Because there was a prophecy, amen, that this baby has to come from the city of David. And if he's got to raise up another emperor in Rome, and that emperor gets suddenly a brainstorm one day, all of his advisers around him might say, "You're nuts. This is going to be so much work. Why are we doing this?" The Senate may have broke out and fights. They may have threatened his life. Then everybody around the world in the in the habitated world at that point. Now they're all disrupted and everybody has to go back to their city of origin and people are moving all over the place. So much so when they got to Bethlehem, the ends were full. There was no place to stay. People are dispersed. Amen. The the whole world is probably grinding their teeth and seething about &gt;&gt; who this emperor was. &gt;&gt; And it all happened because she had the word inside of her and she didn't have to figure anything out. She didn't have to lift a finger to move it. God was moving it. We don't have to understand how God's going to do what he's going to do in the end time. All the prophecies that brother Brandham laid down, it's you be sure it's going to happen. If he's got to raise up kings and knock them down and move nations and start fight and change the whole structure of the world, he's going to change it to bring forth what he promised to bring forth in this age. It'll happen just as sure as you're here. It's going to happen, friends. And you don't have to figure it out. You don't have to join conspiracy theories. You don't have to probe the internet for hours and listen to people sitting in their basement telling you what the government's doing. Forget about it all and stay with this word. Read the message. Listen to the tapes. Stay in your Bible. Stay in prayer. And stop roaming around the internet trying to figure out how God's going to bring to pass what Brother Ben prophesied. Cuz every time you get it wrong, every time. &gt;&gt; God never asked Mary to be smart. Amen. &gt;&gt; He never asked Mary to figure out the conspiracy. &gt;&gt; You know how many conspiracies were floating around &gt;&gt; when Caesar decided to tax the whole world? &gt;&gt; But we know what the conspiracy was. And for us, it's not a theory. It's the truth. God had to get that woman from Nazareth to Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; And he disrupted the whole world to do it. &gt;&gt; God's got to get you to manifest the full life of Jesus Christ. And if he's got to disrupt my life, your life, and everyone around us, he'll disrupt it all to have that manifestation. &gt;&gt; Everything he said would happen will happen. &gt;&gt; Boycott, gold system, whatever, it's all going to happen. But I it's not up to me to figure out how. Do you think Mary was sitting there one day and somebody come and said, "Mary, I saw this scripture where we got to go to Bethl." No. &gt;&gt; And then what does she do? Tell Caesar to bring a worldwide taxation. How many connections do you have in government? &gt;&gt; There's nothing that we're supposed to do except believe the word and surrender to the headship of Christ. Let the spirit of God run our lives and stop using all our thinking. &gt;&gt; Just stick with the word and let the spirit of God move us. Amen.
