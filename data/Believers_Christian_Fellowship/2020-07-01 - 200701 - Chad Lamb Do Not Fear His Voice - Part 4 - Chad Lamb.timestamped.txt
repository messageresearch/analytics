[6:16] the grounds and eat in between and then
[6:18] we'll come back for the second service
[6:20] this coming sunday
[6:22] also i just heard i just got an update
[6:24] that brother ron peterson was released
[6:26] from the hospital he's home recovering
[6:28] so thank god for that amen thank you
[6:30] lord
[6:31] we appreciate the lord he's so good and
[6:33] he's so faithful to keep and honor his
[6:35] word amen
[6:37] amen let's just read while we're
[6:38] standing now revelation 10
[6:41] verse 7
[6:44] but in the day in the days of the voice
[6:46] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[6:48] to sound the mystery of god should be
[6:50] finished
[6:52] as he hath declared to his servants the
[6:54] prophets
[6:55] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[6:57] spake unto me again said go and take the
[6:59] little book which is open in the hand of
[7:01] the angel which standeth upon the sea
[7:03] and upon the earth
[7:04] and i went into the angel and said unto
[7:06] him give me the little book and he said
[7:08] unto me take it eat it up and it shall
[7:11] make thy belly bitter but it shall be in
[7:13] thy mouth sweet as honey
[7:15] and i took the little book out of the
[7:17] angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[7:19] my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i
[7:22] had eaten it my belly was bitter
[7:24] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[7:27] again before many peoples and nations
[7:30] and tongues and kings
[7:33] and there was given me a reed like unto
[7:35] a rod and the angel stood saying rise
[7:38] and measure the temple of god in the
[7:40] altar and them that worshiped therein
[7:43] but the court which is without the
[7:44] temple leave out and measure it not for
[7:46] it is given unto the gentiles and the
[7:49] holy city shall they tread under foot
[7:51] forty and two months
[7:53] amen let's just bow our heads
[7:55] the heavenly father we ask you lord
[7:57] jesus the lord just bless the reading of
[8:00] your word
[8:01] not just this scripture but all the
[8:02] scriptures and the quotes included lord
[8:04] that it would be more than just a
[8:06] service just a man reading scripture
[8:09] and exhorting upon it lord but there
[8:11] would be something supernatural taking
[8:13] place for this is the method that you
[8:15] chose to preach the gospel and we come
[8:17] to honor that and submit ourselves to it
[8:19] lord we pray lord that you would take
[8:22] absolute control and speak your words
[8:24] we pray god that you would hear lord
[8:27] through our hearts that we would receive
[8:28] your word lord and we can grow to the
[8:31] image of what you want from us in this
[8:32] day that we might be pleasing unto you
[8:35] in all things take your word lord and
[8:37] help us to grow lord by it in jesus
[8:40] christ's name we pray
[8:41] amen
[8:42] you can all take your seats
[8:45] amen i want to continue on with the
[8:47] thought that i've been on for several
[8:48] services on do not fear his voice this
[8:51] will be part four i really believed when
[8:54] i started doing this that i was just
[8:55] going to do a little bit of review and
[8:56] go back to a bit of a foundation that
[8:59] we've had over the last couple years and
[9:01] i really believe that i would hit this
[9:02] in one service kind of hit a few of
[9:04] these types and move on and it didn't
[9:07] work out that way amen
[9:09] and so god is just he keeps opening
[9:11] things up and we like it that way and
[9:14] he's had control and and then this uh
[9:16] past sunday was just such a unique
[9:18] service all that were here aware of that
[9:20] and god just took absolute control and
[9:24] and did things that we never anticipated
[9:26] and spoke things that we never thought
[9:28] about and i just want to say i thank him
[9:30] for that amen
[9:31] and so we're going to get back i feel
[9:33] comfortable going in the same direction
[9:35] and so we're going to continue on with
[9:37] do not fear his voice
[9:39] this will be part four and we're going
[9:41] to just keep in the same vein of thought
[9:43] and if the lord will allow us just keep
[9:45] going back to that
[9:47] those points that we've talked about
[9:48] these are these are not brand new things
[9:51] these are not things we've never heard
[9:52] or never discussed but we want to just
[9:54] touch on those points i just feel to
[9:56] touch them again through the old
[9:57] testament and show you know what's
[9:59] taking place here in revelations 10
[10:02] verse eight this transition that's
[10:05] taking place from the seventh church age
[10:07] messenger now to john taking the book
[10:10] and eating the book and prophesying
[10:11] again this is a transition that's been
[10:13] foreshadowed all through the old
[10:15] testament amen there's so many types
[10:17] that'll bring us to our day and show us
[10:20] that his voice is in her
[10:22] and we know that we live in the day when
[10:24] his voice will be in her
[10:26] and that she will be
[10:28] him
[10:29] this is the day when the word is
[10:31] becoming flesh and the flesh is becoming
[10:33] the word
[10:35] so so we live in the day where
[10:38] the the bride will be the final voice to
[10:40] the final age and his voice will be in
[10:42] her and all of these things that we've
[10:44] talked about but we can see this isn't
[10:46] just a concept that brother branham god
[10:49] or something he just thought of it's
[10:50] been laying in the old testament it's
[10:52] been all through the bible amen and once
[10:55] once god opens our eyes to see when a
[10:57] prophet brings it to the surface and and
[10:59] you see that concept and you see it here
[11:02] in the scriptures in revelation chapter
[11:04] 10 then all of a sudden when you go back
[11:06] with your eyes open you see it here and
[11:08] here and here and here and it's and it's
[11:10] all over the place so we would like to
[11:12] go by the grace of god and touch a few
[11:13] of those points and just bring them in
[11:15] to this to just reinforce the foundation
[11:18] the lord's given us to keep moving
[11:19] higher
[11:20] i want to go back and read the quote
[11:22] that i tried to get through on sunday
[11:23] but i only read through half of this
[11:25] quote
[11:27] it's amazing brother franco takes my
[11:29] notes and he puts them on the um
[11:31] uh the archives because people like
[11:33] going through the notes and and and he
[11:35] said you have any notes for sunday i
[11:37] said no notes
[11:39] i just don't have any i mean i come with
[11:41] eight pages of notes and i use none i
[11:43] read the first scripture which is the
[11:44] one we just read and i got halfway
[11:46] through this first quote and then we
[11:47] were gone from there and there was there
[11:50] was no notes so praise god there's no
[11:52] notes
[11:53] and that's the way we like it
[11:55] because god is we want god to operate
[11:57] his gift the way he chooses to operate
[11:59] it not the way we're accustomed to or
[12:02] even what we would consider traditional
[12:04] we want god to take control
[12:06] but let's go to this quote and things
[12:07] that are to be from 1965 brother brahms
[12:10] in the last
[12:11] couple of weeks of his ministry here
[12:14] in december
[12:15] he says now if we are those attributes
[12:17] of god we cannot live by creeds we
[12:19] cannot live by denominationalism we must
[12:22] live by the word because the bride is
[12:24] part of the bridegroom
[12:26] like any wife is part of her husband
[12:28] therefore we must be
[12:30] that word bride now brother brahma is
[12:33] saying we said sunday he's saying a
[12:34] mouthful here we cannot live by
[12:37] denominationalism that won't work my
[12:39] creed that's not going to work but
[12:41] there's only one thing that we can live
[12:43] by is because the bride is part of the
[12:45] bridegroom like any wife is part of her
[12:47] husband so the
[12:49] the the going all the way back to the
[12:51] beginning with adam the son of god in
[12:54] the garden of eden amen his wife was
[12:57] part of him
[12:59] and so that's always the pattern once
[13:01] the pattern starts that's the pattern
[13:02] that's the original that's what god
[13:04] wants because out of god came the word
[13:07] amen and when that word came out of god
[13:09] in the beginning if you go all the way
[13:11] back to the
[13:13] proverbs that word is referred to in the
[13:16] feminist
[13:17] and the feminist expression because that
[13:19] which comes out of the mail is the
[13:20] feminist the female amen and so the word
[13:23] is in the feminist form all the way back
[13:25] in proverbs and the word is called
[13:26] wisdom and wisdom is her name and wisdom
[13:29] is a female amen and and and and the way
[13:32] it's denoted there so you have male and
[13:34] female and then you go to the garden of
[13:36] eden you have male and female and adam's
[13:39] wife was part of him
[13:41] and the bride is part of christ brother
[13:43] brown goes all the way back to calvary
[13:44] and says he was he was they struck that
[13:47] blow in his side and out come the
[13:48] ingredients for the bride and all of
[13:50] these things because she was in him
[13:53] there on calvary she's come out of him
[13:54] she is part of him
[13:56] forever was part forever will be part of
[13:58] him
[14:00] so because she's part of him and he's
[14:02] the word that makes her word also and
[14:04] now she can't live by anything else but
[14:07] the original word
[14:09] with the true revelation and true intent
[14:11] of the word that's what she must live on
[14:14] because that's her origin that's what
[14:15] she is and i would say this way that is
[14:18] the the preaching of that word by
[14:20] revelation to her individually is what
[14:22] is awakening her to why are she where
[14:25] she was before the foundation of the
[14:26] world who she actually is amen spiritual
[14:30] amnesia is stripping away by the
[14:32] revelation of the word in this hour
[14:38] and
[14:40] brother ben says therefore we must be
[14:43] that word bride
[14:45] there's no other options
[14:47] there's a there's another option to be
[14:49] the bride in this day you must be that
[14:51] word bride amen it's going to be a full
[14:53] expression of the word again
[14:56] and he says now and what is the word
[14:58] bride the manifestation of this hour
[15:01] see when we come to this hour we're not
[15:03] worried about any other hours
[15:08] it doesn't matter we can pass the test
[15:11] on the manifestation of another hour
[15:14] it doesn't matter that we can write phd
[15:17] papers on the manifestation of other
[15:20] hours amen that won't do us any good we
[15:23] have to understand and be the
[15:24] manifestation in this hour the hour that
[15:27] we're living the junction in time that
[15:29] we're at and we have to know where we
[15:31] are amen and the great sequence of
[15:33] events and the placing in god's mind we
[15:35] have to know our position and know our
[15:37] place amen because we can never have a
[15:39] proper identity and a proper position if
[15:42] we don't know the hour that we're living
[15:45] in
[15:46] because we were born for an hour and
[15:48] this hour was designed for us and they
[15:50] matched together and there's been a word
[15:52] unfolded to unlock the mystery that's
[15:55] inside the children of god that are born
[15:58] for the manifestation of this hour
[16:01] so so we must we must have the word for
[16:04] this hour and we must be that word bride
[16:08] and what is that word bride the
[16:10] manifestation of this hour the bride not
[16:13] a creed or a denomination but a living
[16:16] oracle of god a living attribute of god
[16:19] displaying to the world the attributes
[16:21] of god in the formation of the bride
[16:23] that's to be expressed in this hour that
[16:25] we're now living
[16:29] amen
[16:30] you know what that means
[16:33] if i could just put it a bluntly but but
[16:36] as kind as i know how
[16:39] it has to be a living oracle of god
[16:43] a living attribute of god
[16:46] alive in this dimension in this time
[16:50] realm amen in this date on the calendar
[16:53] a living oracle of god
[16:55] not a previous living oracle of god but
[16:58] a present day living oracle god living
[17:01] attribute of god
[17:04] so that's why hanging our hat on a
[17:07] previous living oracle
[17:10] is not going to do any good because now
[17:13] we have to be the living oracle the
[17:16] living attributes
[17:17] that's why stopping amen stopping in the
[17:20] prophet's ministry and hanging out just
[17:23] in the prophet's ministry amen and
[17:25] saying he was a living oracle of god he
[17:28] was the living attribute of god and that
[17:30] is an absolute true statement for the
[17:32] hour in which he was alive upon this
[17:34] earth
[17:36] but but god has used that manifestation
[17:40] and he's taken that vessel onto a reward
[17:43] and now there's vessels on the earth
[17:45] that have to be the living manifestation
[17:48] the living oracles the living attributes
[17:50] of god
[17:52] amen
[17:54] and what what will wake up that bride
[17:57] it's the ministry that god brought
[17:59] through that prophet god i mean it was
[18:02] the ministry of jesus christ
[18:05] but the ministry of jesus christ came
[18:07] through a vessel and that vessel was
[18:09] william branham who was the seventh
[18:11] church age messenger prophesied to come
[18:13] he was here he did his part and his part
[18:16] was to be play the role of eleazar amen
[18:19] to bring bride to isaac and see the two
[18:22] connected together and he faithfully
[18:24] fulfilled his role to be the living word
[18:26] for his day
[18:29] and now we have to be faithful to our
[18:31] part to be the living word for our day
[18:35] amen
[18:38] so
[18:39] so
[18:40] it's the
[18:41] living oracle of god that's what the
[18:44] word bride is
[18:45] a living oracle of god
[18:47] living attribute of god displaying to
[18:49] the world the attributes of god in the
[18:52] formation of the bride that's to be
[18:54] expressed in this hour that we're now
[18:56] living so we have moved from church to
[18:59] bride
[19:01] we made that transition and brother
[19:02] bennett made sure it was clear in the
[19:04] first seal he said i no longer call you
[19:06] church i call you bride so that you
[19:09] understand so that you know that during
[19:11] this seals there's a transition taking
[19:13] place we're moving from church to bride
[19:17] and if we move from church to bride then
[19:20] the bride must move from church ages to
[19:21] bride age
[19:23] they go together those transitions
[19:26] and so now i want to go back and i want
[19:28] to pick up a story in the old testament
[19:30] if we can go to first kings together
[19:32] first kings 18
[19:34] and just look at a few things together
[19:37] we've been through this thoroughly so
[19:39] we're just going to touch on it and and
[19:41] draw some pieces out and then move on
[19:44] but let's go to the elijah ministry in
[19:46] first kings 18
[19:48] because the elijah ministry laid a
[19:50] pattern
[19:51] set a foundation
[19:52] which every elijah ministry after that's
[19:54] gonna gonna gonna show forth
[20:00] so
[20:01] first kings 18
[20:04] and verse 30.
[20:06] this is on mount carmel it says and
[20:08] elijah said unto all the people come
[20:10] near unto me and all the people came
[20:12] near unto him
[20:14] and he repaired the altar of the lord
[20:16] that was broken down so when we see the
[20:18] elijah ministry coming to mount the
[20:20] mount carmel showdown he is now going to
[20:23] be beginning to deal with hybrid
[20:25] religion because he's not just dealing
[20:28] with jews who have turned their back on
[20:31] jehovah he's dealing on people that are
[20:34] mixing their worship because he says if
[20:36] baal be god serve him if jehovah begot
[20:39] serve him that you're going to have to
[20:41] pick you can no longer blend paganism
[20:44] with christianity
[20:46] you can no longer blend amen a three god
[20:50] worship with the worship of the god of
[20:52] the bible now on mount carmel elijah's
[20:54] coming to to say you've got we've got to
[20:56] separate these two things out you either
[20:59] choose baal or you choose jehovah but
[21:01] you can't have it both ways anymore
[21:04] so we see the elijah ministry in order
[21:07] to do that he has to repair the altar
[21:10] he's not bringing in a new one he's
[21:12] repairing the one that's there amen and
[21:14] brother ben he didn't bring a new word
[21:16] amen he was to restore the word that was
[21:18] lost
[21:20] through paul and then reveal the
[21:21] mysteries that laid under the seven
[21:23] thunders
[21:24] all right so first he repairs the altar
[21:28] he repaired the altar of the lord that
[21:29] was broken down and elijah took 12
[21:31] stones according to the number of the
[21:32] tribes of the sons of jacob unto whom
[21:35] the word of the lord came saying israel
[21:37] shall be thy name
[21:38] and with the stones he built an altar in
[21:40] the name of the lord and he made a
[21:42] trench about the altar as great as would
[21:45] contain two measures of seed
[21:47] and he put the wood in order and cut the
[21:49] bullock in pieces and laid him on the
[21:51] wood
[21:51] and
[21:53] and said fill four barrels with water
[21:55] and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and
[21:57] on the wood and he said do it the second
[21:59] time and they did it the second time and
[22:01] he said do it the third time and they
[22:03] did it the third time and the water ran
[22:05] round about the altar and he filled the
[22:07] trench also with water and it came to
[22:10] pass at the time of the offering of the
[22:12] evening sacrifice
[22:14] i just want to draw a little truth out
[22:16] of there at the time of the evening
[22:17] sacrifice you know when when moses
[22:20] instituted the temple worship to the
[22:22] children of israel they were told every
[22:24] day to offer two lambs
[22:26] one in the morning and one in the
[22:28] evening showing that there's going to be
[22:30] a lamb in the morning and a lamb in the
[22:32] evening because when you come to the
[22:34] church ages now jesus christ was the
[22:37] lamb that was offered in the morning and
[22:39] jesus christ the word is the lamb that's
[22:41] offered in the evening
[22:43] so now it comes to the time of the
[22:45] evening sacrifice showing that elijah is
[22:48] going to come to the showdown amen to
[22:50] separate paganism and christianity amen
[22:54] win at the time of the evening sacrifice
[22:57] at the setting of the sun and will be
[23:00] light at the evening time at the end of
[23:02] the church ages at the end of the later
[23:05] season church age all these things are
[23:06] telling us the same story over and over
[23:09] and over again
[23:10] that's why when we read through the
[23:12] bible when we separate out little
[23:14] stories and
[23:15] and we don't make them tell one story we
[23:17] begin to miss so much of what's going on
[23:19] in the bible but actually all the
[23:22] scripture is pointing to this day
[23:25] all the scripture is pointing to this
[23:26] day and when we read the word we just
[23:28] say god open it to me amen you can't we
[23:31] can't force anything neither do we want
[23:33] to cram pieces in places that they don't
[23:35] fit but once we have our eyes open and
[23:37] we realize what we're going what's going
[23:39] on all around us amen what is happening
[23:43] then we go back to the word and it's
[23:45] laying there it's just laying there you
[23:47] don't put it there it's just there
[23:50] so now he comes at the time of the
[23:52] evening sacrifice that elijah the
[23:54] prophet came near and said to the lord
[23:56] to the said lord god of abraham isaac
[23:58] and of israel let it be known this day
[24:00] that thou art god in israel and that i
[24:02] am thy servant and that i have done all
[24:04] these things at thy word
[24:07] hear me o lord hear me that this people
[24:10] may know that thou art the lord god and
[24:12] that thou has turned their heart back
[24:15] again
[24:17] does anybody remember malachi 4
[24:19] what's he supposed to do turn their
[24:21] heart back so now we have elijah amen
[24:23] he's setting the stage for what will
[24:25] come in the future and now he comes at
[24:28] the time of the evening sacrifice he
[24:30] comes to a showdown between mixed hybrid
[24:33] religion and he's going to restore him
[24:36] he's going to restore the people of god
[24:38] back to the original worship to the
[24:40] original altar he's going to build it
[24:42] back with 12 stones he's repairing the
[24:44] altar what's he doing he's bringing them
[24:47] back to the original
[24:50] at the time of the evening sacrifice and
[24:52] he's saying lord you're turning their
[24:55] hearts back showing that this is the
[24:57] elijah ministry that's going to come
[24:58] again to turn the hearts of the children
[25:00] back to the fathers
[25:02] it's beautiful
[25:04] so we see elijah
[25:06] very much this is the same ministry of
[25:08] malachi 4 very much the same spirit so
[25:11] we can see that very easy
[25:13] brother branham is going to do the same
[25:14] thing
[25:16] amen
[25:18] he's going to repair
[25:19] the proper place of worship
[25:22] the only provided place of worship he's
[25:24] going to bring it back and then he's
[25:26] going to repair the altar that was torn
[25:27] down he's going to bring back the gospel
[25:29] of paul that was lost through the church
[25:31] ages he's going to come at the time of
[25:33] the evening sacrifice amen he's even
[25:35] going to preach indictment showing that
[25:37] the lamb had been slain in the evening
[25:39] time amen and he's doing that to turn
[25:41] the hearts back
[25:43] but
[25:44] we know in his ministry
[25:46] that he's also commissioned to do three
[25:50] things before he leaves one of them is
[25:52] to anoint elisha to be prophet in his
[25:54] place anoint jehu to be king and an
[25:57] anoint hezel to be king of syria he's
[26:00] supposed to do these three things but we
[26:01] know in his lifetime that he only
[26:03] accomplishes one and that's when he
[26:05] anoints elisha a meant to be to be
[26:07] prophet in his place by throwing the
[26:09] mantle over him and all of those things
[26:11] so i'm just going through this quickly
[26:13] because we've been through it before but
[26:15] in the message trying to do god a
[26:16] service without it being god's will the
[26:18] prophet of god says now he promised that
[26:21] so that sets the bible just exactly to
[26:23] this day and the sodom and gomorrah
[26:26] elijah was not that wasn't elijah that
[26:28] was the spirit of god on elijah elijah
[26:31] was just a man
[26:32] now we've had elijahs and elijah's coats
[26:34] and elijah's mantles and elijah's
[26:36] everything but the elijah of this day is
[26:38] the lord jesus christ
[26:41] i say that for a reason so that we know
[26:44] what was that spirit working in brother
[26:46] branham it was a son of man revealing
[26:48] the son of man that spirit of elijah in
[26:51] our day was none other than the lord
[26:53] jesus christ
[26:56] right
[26:57] and he was working through the form of
[26:59] elijah amen through a prophet amen but
[27:02] it was none other than the lord jesus
[27:04] christ so he said but the elijah of this
[27:06] day is the lord jesus christ
[27:09] he is to come according to matthew the
[27:12] luke 17 30 it says the son of man is to
[27:15] reveal himself among his people not a
[27:16] man but god but it'll come through a
[27:19] prophet
[27:20] so now brother man is really he's really
[27:22] separating things out he's removing his
[27:24] flesh from the equation and he's saying
[27:26] the real elijah that's to come this luke
[27:29] 17 30 all these prophecies amen and he's
[27:32] even tying it to malachi 4 because he
[27:34] says the elijah that's to come amen he
[27:36] says really it's the lord jesus christ
[27:39] but it'll come through a prophet so he's
[27:41] going to use a vessel
[27:42] so we know that the the elijah spirit in
[27:45] our day is the lord jesus christ that's
[27:48] important to note
[27:50] then we get into it is the rising of the
[27:52] sun from 65 he says the same quickening
[27:55] power of god presented in both these
[27:57] prophets look at their names are almost
[27:59] the same elisha elijah see the bride and
[28:03] the groom
[28:04] one of them is mr jesus the other one is
[28:07] mrs jesus you see almost the same just
[28:10] between the he and she
[28:12] so brother branham is showing us he's
[28:14] using this type to show that there's a
[28:15] resurrection and a rapture but he's
[28:17] taking us and showing us elijah and
[28:19] elisha are almost the same name just the
[28:22] difference between he and she
[28:24] he and she bride and bridegroom and i'm
[28:27] going to ask if the elijah spirit of
[28:30] this day was none other than the lord
[28:32] jesus christ then what is the elisha
[28:35] spirit of this day
[28:38] it's the lord jesus christ
[28:40] only difference is between he and she
[28:42] he and she
[28:44] amen
[28:46] so let's turn to second kings
[28:53] second kings chapter two
[28:56] now when we get into when we get into
[28:59] second kings
[29:02] oh i don't know how i want to do this i
[29:04] think
[29:04] brother frank if you could get this
[29:06] white board up
[29:07] i want to write something on the white
[29:09] board here in just a second
[29:11] but when we go into second kings chapter
[29:13] two uh it's time for elijah is going to
[29:16] leave and he and he keeps trying to get
[29:19] elisha to stay where he's at so he's
[29:21] going to move from gilgal and he's going
[29:22] to move to bethel then down to jericho
[29:25] and then the jordan and each time he
[29:27] tests elisha and he tells elisha you
[29:29] know you stay here and elijah said as
[29:31] the lord lives and my soul lives i'll
[29:33] not leave thee and so elijah's refusing
[29:36] and he's traveling he's traveling this
[29:38] road with elijah step and step and he
[29:41] won't leave elijah anywhere if elijah's
[29:44] moving on
[29:45] elisha's moving on
[29:49] and he's discouraged in every way he's
[29:51] discouraged by elijah himself he's
[29:53] discouraged by the school of the
[29:54] prophets amen everybody's speaking to
[29:57] him discouragement but there's something
[29:59] in elijah that says if elijah goes there
[30:02] i go there too
[30:06] this is really good friends this is
[30:08] really good so we're up so he's going to
[30:11] move through four stages
[30:18] he's going to go from gilgal
[30:22] to
[30:23] bethel
[30:29] to jericho
[30:33] and to jordan
[30:39] and now
[30:41] these four stages are important because
[30:43] brother banham shows us four stages in
[30:45] the wheat plant coming up and he shows
[30:47] us four stages amen to the new birth he
[30:50] shows us justification sanctification
[30:52] baptism of the holy ghost but brother
[30:54] brahm doesn't stop at the baptism of
[30:56] holy ghost he said justification made a
[30:58] way for sanctification sanctification
[31:01] made it away for
[31:02] the baptism holy ghost and the baptism
[31:04] holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost
[31:06] himself because brother benham starts
[31:08] showing us that you can have the baptism
[31:10] of the holy ghost every day of your life
[31:12] and die and go to hell
[31:15] because if he says it's a genuine the
[31:18] genuine holy ghost he's not talking
[31:20] about a fake holy ghost or an imposter
[31:22] spirit but the genuine holy ghost
[31:24] because there's three realms to you your
[31:26] flesh your spirit and then your there's
[31:28] your soul that has the life of god in
[31:30] the inside amen if that baptism holy
[31:32] spirit only falls down low enough to hit
[31:34] your spirit realm
[31:37] then you'll get excited you'll dance
[31:39] you'll shout you'll say amen but if that
[31:41] spirit doesn't go deep enough to quicken
[31:44] to life the sieging of god that's laying
[31:46] there waiting for this word to come and
[31:48] hit it amen then then
[31:51] then he says you can be you can have the
[31:52] baptism holy ghost every day of your
[31:54] life and die and go to hell what's he
[31:56] talking about it's the baptism holy
[31:57] ghost that only hits the spirit realm of
[32:00] a man but not the life in the soul
[32:02] because if there's no life there the
[32:04] holy ghost can come down it can hit the
[32:06] flesh it can hit your spirit but when it
[32:09] hits the soul there's nothing there to
[32:11] quicken there has to be something just
[32:13] like that spirit down in that soul and
[32:16] those two like parts have to make a
[32:18] connection to spring and forth to life
[32:21] so if there's nothing there amen then it
[32:24] doesn't go to the fourth stage
[32:27] so we have
[32:35] justification
[32:58] and so now
[33:00] elijah is leading him elisha through
[33:03] these four stages
[33:06] and in every stage he's saying stop
[33:09] because the lutherans were content to
[33:11] stop
[33:12] the wesleyans were content to stop and
[33:14] the pentecostals were content to stop
[33:17] but god is looking for one that won't
[33:18] stop
[33:19] no matter how many times they're told to
[33:21] stop you stay here stop you stay here
[33:24] amen and then and then all the school of
[33:26] the prophets don't go any further amen
[33:28] do you know elijah's going to be taken
[33:29] away amen you can't walk that road he's
[33:32] walking amen you stay here you stay here
[33:34] you stay here amen but god was testing
[33:37] elisha to see if elijah would go all the
[33:40] way with elijah
[33:42] right
[33:44] and so you the the plant has to go
[33:47] through stalk
[33:51] through tossing
[33:54] through shuck
[33:56] to get back to wheat seed
[34:01] the holy ghost himself
[34:04] the person of the word
[34:05] alive in you
[34:08] so now uh
[34:09] elisha is elijah's making this journey
[34:13] and
[34:13] uh elijah is saying stay here elisha
[34:16] says no if you're going i'm going.
[34:20] if you preach it i believe it
[34:23] if you say it i believe it if you preach
[34:26] it i'll preach it to you
[34:29] amen he's going all the way if elijah
[34:33] went there elisha goes there amen and
[34:35] and now and now elijah's going to come
[34:38] down to jordan and jordan is like a veil
[34:40] amen and the veil has to be rent for him
[34:43] to move across this four stage amen to
[34:45] go and to go into the holy of holies
[34:47] he's got to rent the veil so he takes
[34:49] his mantle which is prophet's office and
[34:51] he takes that mantle and he smacks the
[34:54] water and when he hits the water the
[34:56] veil the it's the word the water of the
[34:58] word there's water over jordan but that
[35:01] the word is veiling is hiding a mystery
[35:04] that's under the water
[35:07] because all the way back in the exodus
[35:09] journey when joshua was leading them
[35:11] through the ex leading them across
[35:13] jordan amen when they went across jordan
[35:15] the waters parted when the priest
[35:17] entered in with the word on their
[35:18] shoulders the waters parted the vale ran
[35:21] and when the veil was rent they walked
[35:22] across on dry land into the into the
[35:25] promised land and he told 12 princes of
[35:28] the tribes of the 12 tribes to gather a
[35:31] stone and each of them took a stone and
[35:33] they piled the stone in in the middle of
[35:36] jordan in the midst of jordan they piled
[35:38] 12 stones
[35:41] and then they piled 12 stones in gilgal
[35:44] the camp of gilgal on the outside of
[35:46] jordan
[35:47] and when they finally got across all the
[35:50] stones are piled they moved across when
[35:52] they moved across the waters covered
[35:54] back over showing that there's some
[35:56] mystery stone stones is a revelation
[35:59] there's mystery stones laying in jordan
[36:01] and it's covered over by the word amen
[36:04] it's there amen but you can't see it but
[36:07] the elijah ministry will come down with
[36:09] a prophetic mantle from the prophetic
[36:11] office take it off and smack that water
[36:13] and rent the veil and walk across
[36:16] because where did joshua place those
[36:18] stones they were hard against jericho
[36:22] they crossed at jericho amen where does
[36:25] elijah come back down and hit the water
[36:28] at jericho
[36:30] the same crossing amen and opens the
[36:33] water amen and and the scripture doesn't
[36:36] say this
[36:37] i'm just they're at the same place
[36:40] there's a mystery laying in the water
[36:42] and i i thought it often in my mind i
[36:44] thought this way elijah's is walking
[36:46] along and elijah's walking along and all
[36:48] of a sudden they see this pyramid of 12
[36:50] stones
[36:54] what's that
[36:55] do you see that and elijah just keeps
[36:57] walking
[37:01] goes to the other side and gets caught
[37:03] up in a whirlwind of cherry to fire
[37:06] and that mantle falls back on elisha
[37:10] and he says what would you have what
[37:12] would you have i do for you and he says
[37:14] give me a double portion of thy spirit
[37:17] he says you've asked a hard thing but if
[37:19] you see me go
[37:21] if you see me go then you can have that
[37:24] and he stayed with him all the way
[37:26] through the journey crossed the veil all
[37:28] the way through amen the opening of the
[37:30] water the the revelations that were
[37:32] laying in the word all the way through
[37:34] saw him go amen and it's important this
[37:37] is just brother chad but to me it's
[37:39] important that he sees elijah go and
[37:41] knows that elijah's gone
[37:44] because now elisha is not going amen
[37:48] elisha is not going to be waiting for
[37:50] elijah to do something elijah's done all
[37:52] that elijah's going to do
[37:55] so in this transition it's important
[37:57] that elisha sees elijah go
[38:01] and now elisha knows and we're going to
[38:03] read it in the scripture elisha knows
[38:05] that elijah is gone
[38:08] and now god did with elijah what god's
[38:11] going to do with elijah but that mantle
[38:13] fell and brother brahma said elisha
[38:15] picked up that mantle and we know the
[38:18] scripture tells the same thing he goes
[38:20] back to jordan now jordan is in the same
[38:23] condition it was before he crossed it
[38:25] the first time it's there it's covered
[38:28] over water's covering it amen he he's
[38:31] not able to get across in any human way
[38:34] or see the stones that they're laying
[38:35] under the water but he takes the same
[38:38] mantle that elijah was wearing because
[38:40] you realize elisha does not get his own
[38:43] mantle
[38:45] because the bride of jesus christ she
[38:47] does not get her own mantle she has to
[38:50] take elijah's mantle he was the prophet
[38:53] he brought the word he he gave the
[38:56] perfect interpretation the word with
[38:57] divine vindication
[39:00] not her
[39:01] him
[39:02] so she has to take that same mantle not
[39:05] a new mantle that's why the bride can't
[39:08] be preaching something different than
[39:10] what the prophet preached
[39:13] she can't she can't have more she can't
[39:16] have more revelation or different
[39:17] revelation on the scriptures amen
[39:20] because he's the one who broke open the
[39:22] scriptures
[39:25] but
[39:26] she saw him go
[39:28] and now
[39:29] elisha saw elijah go and now it wasn't
[39:32] just a mantle that came back but that
[39:34] spirit came back and with that spirit
[39:38] now in a new vessel now elisha can take
[39:41] that mantle and now elisha can strike
[39:44] the word the word can part amen elisha
[39:48] can go across and now elisha can uncover
[39:51] the 12 mystery stones that are laying
[39:53] there in pyramid form under jordan
[39:57] amen
[39:58] so so now we're seeing amen it's just
[40:02] like he and she just like the elijah of
[40:05] this day is the lord jesus christ amen
[40:07] and that spirit has come back upon the
[40:10] elisha of this day which is the bride
[40:12] and the bride can take that same mantle
[40:14] that the prophet was wearing that
[40:16] prophetic ministry that prophetic
[40:18] ministry on the word and smite that word
[40:21] and open it up and reveal the stones
[40:23] that are laying there
[40:26] you see
[40:31] it wasn't
[40:33] it wasn't that elijah
[40:36] could catch the same spirit
[40:39] and go sit down
[40:41] with the school of the prophets
[40:43] and drink tea
[40:45] and just tell all the stories about when
[40:47] i was with elijah i saw him do this and
[40:50] i saw him do that and i saw him do that
[40:54] right
[40:55] that's what everybody else did with
[40:56] every other prophetic ministry
[40:58] they would sit down and reminisce about
[41:00] did you remember this and you remember
[41:02] that i heard this story and i met a lady
[41:04] one time who's had this encounter and
[41:06] this and that and that and we just drink
[41:08] tea and just talk about what happened
[41:09] but there was something different with
[41:11] elisha he didn't have to just talk about
[41:13] what happened because that spirit came
[41:15] back on him amen and now he had the
[41:18] spirit of elijah was now in him because
[41:22] the the spirit that was in elijah was
[41:23] the lord jesus christ and the lord jesus
[41:26] christ is here and his bride
[41:31] so
[41:32] let's look at second kings
[41:36] chapter 2 verse 9 now
[41:38] and it came to pass when they were gone
[41:40] over that elijah said unto elisha ask
[41:42] what i shall do for thee before i be
[41:44] taken away from thee and elisha said i
[41:46] pray thee let a double portion of thy
[41:48] spirit be
[41:50] upon me
[41:53] brother says in the message the
[41:54] uncertain sound he says when elijah the
[41:56] old prophet represented christ elisha
[41:58] the young prophet followed him across
[42:00] jordan when he come back he had a double
[42:02] portion and the church followed christ
[42:04] at calvary and the mantle of christ fell
[42:06] down with the baptism of the holy ghost
[42:08] and jesus said these things that i do
[42:10] shall you do also and even greater than
[42:12] this shall you do because i go to my
[42:14] father and so brother bram's using the
[42:16] same thing between elijah christ and now
[42:19] christ come back into his church and
[42:21] that's elijah and elisha
[42:23] so he's using that same type in the same
[42:25] way now let's go down to verse 16.
[42:27] [Music]
[42:29] no i'm sorry let's go to verse 14.
[42:33] and he took the mantle of elijah elijah
[42:35] went up in a chariot a fire he took the
[42:37] amanda elijah that fell from him and
[42:39] smote the waters and said where is the
[42:40] lord god of elijah
[42:42] when he also had smitten in the waters
[42:44] they parted hither and there and elisha
[42:45] went over
[42:46] and when the sons of the prophets which
[42:48] were to view at jericho saw him they
[42:50] said the spirit of elijah does rest on
[42:53] elisha and they came to meet him and
[42:55] bowed themselves to the ground before
[42:58] him
[42:59] now when what did they see him do
[43:04] that caused them to recognize where that
[43:06] spirit is
[43:09] it wasn't
[43:10] a healing miracle
[43:13] it wasn't
[43:15] i should say it this way
[43:17] it wasn't anything a pentecostal can do
[43:24] because that could just be the
[43:26] pentecostal spirit
[43:28] but where do you ensure that it's the
[43:30] same lord jesus christ that was in
[43:32] elijah is now an elisha how do you know
[43:35] it's the same spirit and not just a
[43:37] pentecostal spirit
[43:40] because he did the thing with the mantle
[43:44] that elijah did he took elijah's mantle
[43:46] and hit the water so he took the tape
[43:49] say man he took the books amen and he
[43:51] took that and he hit the water and when
[43:53] he hit the water amen the water parted
[43:56] amen and all the sudden he could expose
[43:59] those mystery stones that were laying
[44:01] under the water and had been laying
[44:03] there all the way back when they first
[44:05] crossed into israel amen and all the way
[44:08] back when the bible was written they
[44:10] meant when they were crossing in to the
[44:12] first church age amen there were stones
[44:14] that were placed in the book of
[44:15] revelation called seven thunders
[44:18] and you could see that they were placed
[44:20] there but then the water covered them
[44:22] over and nobody could tell what those
[44:24] seven thunders were they were mysteries
[44:26] they men sealed up to the time of the
[44:28] end amen and they were laying there but
[44:31] an elijah ministry in our day was able
[44:33] to take his office of a prophet and take
[44:36] his mantle and strike the water and part
[44:38] it and show us those seven mysteries
[44:40] that have been in the word the whole
[44:42] time
[44:44] just like these 12 stones that have been
[44:46] laying there in the water the whole time
[44:48] and now when when the school of prophets
[44:52] when they saw elisha come down to jordan
[44:54] and hit it with the men on opening up
[44:56] and expose those stones they said the
[44:59] the the spirit of elijah now rests upon
[45:02] elisha
[45:04] so if you want to know where the spirit
[45:06] of the lord jesus christ is in this day
[45:08] it's not
[45:10] i got to be super careful the way i say
[45:12] this it's not just in those that can do
[45:15] what pentecostals can do
[45:20] because you can't take pentecostal
[45:22] babies supernatural things
[45:24] but pentecostals do a lot of
[45:26] supernatural things
[45:28] so this third pool because this vision
[45:31] is the third pull of the baby shoe you
[45:32] can't lace up the baby shoe with the big
[45:35] cord you can't teach pentecostal babies
[45:37] supernatural things meaning meaning when
[45:40] you come to the third pool this is the
[45:42] true supernatural things
[45:45] and the third pull is the opening of the
[45:47] word the revealing of the
[45:49] mysteries
[45:51] and you can't teach that to pentecostal
[45:53] babies because pentecostal babies can't
[45:55] catch the revelation of the word but
[45:57] they can catch the manifestation of
[46:00] spiritual gifts
[46:03] so i say that not to diminish spiritual
[46:06] gifts spiritual gifts go with it and
[46:08] spiritual gifts should be in the true
[46:10] church of the living god amen
[46:12] all kinds of spiritual gifts they should
[46:14] be there and should be operating but
[46:16] that is not what the prophet the school
[46:18] of the prophet saw to declare that
[46:20] spirit that was in elijah is now on
[46:22] elisha it's when elisha could take that
[46:24] mantle and strike the word and open it
[46:27] up and reveal those stones and himself
[46:32] and so now the bride and the elijah
[46:35] ministries she's got that same spirit
[46:37] amen and now she can take that prophet
[46:39] some man on take those books amen take
[46:41] those quotes and hit the water and the
[46:43] water can open here and open there and
[46:45] open there and show us those mystery
[46:47] stones that are laying in the water
[46:50] that's why it's so important to be
[46:52] preaching the revelation of the word
[46:56] not just manifestations of the spirit
[46:59] but the greatest manifestation of the
[47:00] spirit in this day is being able to take
[47:03] the sword of the king
[47:07] which is the word of the lord
[47:10] and open up the word
[47:13] and see the great mystery that's been in
[47:15] the back part of god's mind
[47:18] for all this time waiting to be revealed
[47:20] at the end time
[47:22] amen
[47:26] so
[47:27] now let's look over here at verse 16.
[47:33] and they said unto him behold now there
[47:35] be thy there be with thy servant fifty
[47:38] strong men let them go we pray thee and
[47:41] seek thy master lest per venture the
[47:43] spirit of the lord hath taken him up and
[47:45] cast him upon some mountain or unto some
[47:47] valley and he said you shall not send
[47:51] they said now with the school of
[47:52] prophets the same one who said that
[47:53] spirit was in him is now in you
[47:57] but we want to go find him
[48:01] why do you need him when his spirit is
[48:03] in elisha
[48:06] see it's just human thinking human
[48:08] understanding now they want to go get
[48:10] that flesh body again because the flesh
[48:13] body amen it was the vessel that was
[48:15] being used and now they have an affinity
[48:17] an attachment to the flesh body now the
[48:20] spirit that was in that flesh body has
[48:22] now moved into elisha and in elisha they
[48:25] declare by seeing that what he did that
[48:27] that spirit is now in you proving they
[48:30] didn't want the spirit they wanted the
[48:32] flesh body something they could see and
[48:34] hold
[48:36] because if all they wanted was the same
[48:38] spirit of the lord jesus christ that
[48:39] same spirit was now in elisha
[48:44] but they wanted what was previous
[48:48] and so now
[48:51] he says
[48:52] don't go
[48:54] verse 17 and when they urged him until
[48:56] he was ashamed he said sin
[48:58] they sent there for fifty men and they
[49:00] sought three days but found him not
[49:03] and when they came again to him for he
[49:05] tarried at jericho he said unto them did
[49:08] i not say unto you go not
[49:11] i could have saved you guys a lot of
[49:12] time i said don't go you're not going to
[49:15] find anything
[49:16] you're not going to find anything
[49:18] looking through relics you're not going
[49:19] to find anything going back to famous
[49:21] places
[49:23] you're not going to you're not going to
[49:24] find anything amen looking or waiting
[49:27] amen for that vessel for that for that
[49:30] physical body amen because why because
[49:32] elisha knew that that spirit now fell in
[49:35] him
[49:37] and listen remember it's the difference
[49:38] between he and she christ and the bride
[49:40] bridegroom and bride so where are we at
[49:43] today amen that same spirit of the lord
[49:46] jesus christ that was working in the
[49:47] elijah ministry through a prophet to
[49:49] fulfill malachi 4 luke 17 30 amen
[49:52] revelation 10 1-7 it was all fulfilled
[49:54] there amen but that life is still here
[49:58] amen that spirit is still here but where
[50:00] is the spirit i'll tell you where it's
[50:02] at it's in the place it's in the vessel
[50:05] that can take the mantle strike the word
[50:07] part the waters and show the mystery
[50:09] stones laying underneath that's where
[50:11] that spirit is
[50:14] it's in a mini-membered bride
[50:16] globally around the world
[50:20] so now let's go back and look at
[50:22] revelation 22.
[50:29] revelation 22
[50:32] very very familiar
[50:37] but i just want to lay all these in take
[50:39] our time
[50:41] revelation 22 17 and the spirit and the
[50:43] bride say come and let him that heareth
[50:45] say come and let him that is a thirst
[50:47] come and whosoever will let him take the
[50:50] water of life freely
[50:52] so so the bride
[50:54] now and the spirit are speaking the same
[50:56] thing so what spirit is this
[51:01] how many spirits do you want
[51:04] one spirit the same spirit that amen the
[51:08] same spirit that was here in flesh of
[51:10] the nazarene
[51:12] the same spirit that was poured out on
[51:14] the day of pentecost the same spirit
[51:16] that was here in the prophet the seventh
[51:18] church age messenger it's the same
[51:20] spirit and now the spirit and the bride
[51:23] say come because the spirit is now
[51:25] speaking through the bride
[51:28] they're in harmony so if we want to hear
[51:30] from the spirit
[51:34] amen
[51:36] brother bam says in the later scene
[51:38] church age right out of the church age
[51:40] book he said once more god will reveal
[51:41] the truth as he did to paul
[51:43] in the days of the seventh messenger in
[51:45] the days of the laodicean age its
[51:47] messenger will reveal the mysteries of
[51:49] god as revealed to paul he will speak
[51:51] out and those who receive that prophet
[51:53] in his own name will receive the benefit
[51:56] beneficent effect of that prophet's
[51:58] ministry and they that hear him will be
[52:00] blessed and become part of the bride of
[52:02] the last day who are mentioned in
[52:04] revelation 22 17 the spirit and the
[52:06] bride say come
[52:08] the corn of wheat the bride we that fell
[52:10] into the ground and nicea has come back
[52:12] to original word grain again praise god
[52:15] forever yes listen to the authenticated
[52:18] prophet of god who appears in this last
[52:20] age what he says from god the bride will
[52:23] say the spirit and the prophet and the
[52:25] bride will be saying the same thing and
[52:27] what they say will have already been
[52:30] said in the word they are saying it now
[52:32] come out from among her now and be
[52:34] separate
[52:36] so now
[52:37] she's
[52:38] she's now making the same declaration
[52:41] that elijah did on mount carmel in the
[52:43] mount carmel showdown
[52:46] if baal be god serve him
[52:48] if
[52:49] what was what was elijah doing elijah
[52:51] was saying leave separate come back to
[52:54] the original come back to jehovah come
[52:56] back to the repaired altar turn the
[52:58] hearts of the children back amen and now
[53:01] amen the spirit and the prophet and the
[53:03] bride are saying the same thing come
[53:05] amen in order to come you have to leave
[53:07] amen leave and come amen i'm not where
[53:10] you are but you come to where i am
[53:12] because where i am is where the water of
[53:14] life is flowing freely
[53:17] she is with the water of life the water
[53:19] of life is flowing out of her belly
[53:22] isn't that what jesus christ said out of
[53:24] your belly shall flow rivers of living
[53:25] water amen the living water is flowing
[53:28] freely amen from her belly because she
[53:30] has the word and as she proclaims the
[53:32] word the fountain of living water is
[53:34] open in this day
[53:37] and she's saying come
[53:40] come
[53:41] come from where you are to here
[53:44] you can't have both
[53:45] it's one or the other we can't have
[53:47] denominationalism and creed and drink
[53:49] from this fountain
[53:51] but we've got to leave all
[53:52] denominationalism and creed and come to
[53:54] the fountain and at the end of the book
[53:57] who is making the call the spirit and
[53:59] the bride
[54:02] where are we in this book
[54:06] are we at the end of the book
[54:10] if we're at the end of the book and this
[54:12] world is going to want to hear hear
[54:13] direct from heaven amen what vessel is
[54:16] he going to use
[54:18] i'm volunteering right now god i'm not
[54:21] fit i'm not worthy but by your blood by
[54:23] the washing of your spirit you can clean
[54:25] this vessel sanctify it by the washing
[54:28] of water the word to make it something
[54:29] fit for you to use but if you've got to
[54:31] have a mouthpiece if you've got that
[54:33] vocal cords if you've got to have a
[54:34] flesh body to manifest the life of jesus
[54:37] christ i'm volunteering this one right
[54:39] now and i'm surrendering myself on the
[54:41] altar and saying consume me god burn up
[54:44] everything that's not like you because
[54:46] there's nobody else on earth that's
[54:47] volunteering for the job but there still
[54:50] has to be a fountain of living water
[54:51] flowing there still has to be a source
[54:53] there still has to be a place there
[54:55] still has to be vocal cords on this
[54:57] earth declaring the word of the lord
[55:01] there's got to be a place for the people
[55:03] of this world and if it's got to be
[55:05] wherever the bride and the spirit are
[55:07] speaking
[55:10] praise be to god
[55:12] let's go to luke
[55:15] chapter one
[55:17] i feel like i'm going off like a scatter
[55:19] gun but i like it
[55:21] i like it i just want to grab several
[55:23] things here if you just hang with me a
[55:24] little bit longer luke chapter one
[55:28] we started into this a few weeks ago but
[55:30] i want to keep going here
[55:32] luke chapter 1
[55:34] verse 12.
[55:36] when zechariah saw him zechariah we know
[55:39] is performing as priest offices he's
[55:40] he's in the tabernacle and he sees an
[55:42] angel we know that angel's gabriel and
[55:45] gabriel begins to he sees him and he's
[55:47] scared he says when zechariah saw him
[55:50] he was troubled and fear fell upon him
[55:52] but the angel said unto him fear not
[55:54] zacharias for thy prayer is heard and
[55:56] thy wife elizabeth shall bear thee a son
[55:58] and thou shalt call his name john
[56:01] and thou shalt have joy and gladness and
[56:03] many shall rejoice at his birth for he
[56:05] shall be great in the sight of the lord
[56:07] and shall drink neither wine nor strong
[56:08] drink and he shall be filled with the
[56:10] holy ghost even from his mother's womb
[56:13] and many of the children of israel shall
[56:15] he turn to the lord their god and he
[56:17] shall go before them in the spirit and
[56:19] power of elias to turn the heart of the
[56:21] fathers to the children and the
[56:23] disobedient to the wisdom of the just to
[56:25] make ready a people prepared for the
[56:27] lord
[56:28] and zacharias said unto the angel
[56:31] whereby shall i know this for i am an
[56:33] old man and my wife while stricken in
[56:35] years and the angel answered and said
[56:37] unto him i am gabriel that stand in the
[56:39] presence of god and am sent to speak
[56:41] unto thee and to show thee these glad
[56:43] tidings
[56:44] and behold thou shalt be dumb and not
[56:47] able to speak until the day that these
[56:48] things shall be performed because thou
[56:51] believeth not my words which shall be
[56:53] fulfilled in their season
[56:56] so here comes zechariah zacharias is a
[56:58] priest under the priest order he's
[57:01] serving in the temple he knows the word
[57:04] he meets an angel of the lord the angel
[57:06] lord tells him of the ministry of the
[57:08] forerunner that's coming through him and
[57:09] his wife they're old amen then this is
[57:12] typing the old church in the old order
[57:14] he's a righteous man his wife is
[57:16] righteous amen in in the angel speaks to
[57:19] him and he begins to doubt he questions
[57:21] the word of the angel said how shall
[57:23] this be because i'm old my wife is old
[57:25] and and brother branham said he should
[57:27] have never done that being a priest he
[57:28] should have known that god did this
[57:30] before when he brought a child through
[57:32] an elderly couple of abraham and sarah
[57:35] and because
[57:36] god had done it in the word before when
[57:39] it comes and he can tell zechariah
[57:40] you're going to have it now zechariah
[57:42] questioned it and because he questioned
[57:44] it he was smitten dumb and could not
[57:46] speak
[57:48] see this is very symbolic because
[57:51] there's been an angel come in our day
[57:54] and all the old ministry of all the old
[57:56] church ages questioned
[57:59] and when they questioned they were
[58:01] smitten dumb
[58:04] you're not speaking anymore because you
[58:07] questioned
[58:08] the word of the lord coming through the
[58:10] angel of the lord
[58:11] through the messenger and all that
[58:13] messenger was doing was telling you it's
[58:15] time for the prophecies to be fulfilled
[58:17] and in our day an angel come to tell us
[58:19] it's time for the prophecy be fulfilled
[58:21] and those that questioned it and those
[58:22] that doubted it god smitten dumb
[58:25] oh they keep talking they keep talking
[58:27] in microphones but they're not saying
[58:29] nothing
[58:33] smitten
[58:34] dumb but there's a transition
[58:38] that takes place let's look at verse 39.
[58:41] now mary in the meantime she gets a
[58:43] visitation from the same angel gabriel
[58:45] tells her that thou are highly favored
[58:47] you're going to have a child it'll be of
[58:49] the most holy of the most high god son
[58:51] of the most high god and also your
[58:53] cousin elizabeth is is pregnant so verse
[58:57] 39 it says and mary arose in those days
[58:59] and went into the hill country with
[59:00] haste into the city of judah and entered
[59:03] into the house of zacharias and saluted
[59:05] elizabeth and it came to pass that when
[59:07] elizabeth heard the salutation of mary
[59:10] the babe leaped in her womb and
[59:11] elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost
[59:13] and she spake out with a loud voice and
[59:16] said blessed art thou are among women
[59:18] and blessed is thy fruit of thy womb and
[59:20] whence is this to me that the mother of
[59:22] my lord shall come to me
[59:25] for lo as soon as the voice of thy
[59:27] salutation sounded in mine ears the babe
[59:30] leaped in my womb for joy and blessed is
[59:32] she that believed for there shall be a
[59:35] performance of those things which were
[59:36] told her from the lord
[59:38] now this is an amazing amazing
[59:40] scriptures because of where it's placed
[59:43] where right here at the beginning of the
[59:44] new testament the new testament is just
[59:47] beginning these are the one of the first
[59:49] happenings in the sequence of events
[59:52] not in the writing and order because you
[59:53] have matthew marked and look but in the
[59:55] sequence of events
[59:57] this is one of the first things
[59:58] happening and what happens is the old
[1:00:00] priesthood they doubt smitten dumb but
[1:00:03] now his wife begins to prophesy and
[1:00:06] declare the word
[1:00:07] now zachariah is dumb because of his
[1:00:10] doubt but elizabeth now is speaking the
[1:00:13] word
[1:00:15] and elizabeth is saying what the angel
[1:00:18] told mary in a private interview
[1:00:22] how did she know it she caught it by
[1:00:25] inspiration and by inspiration and
[1:00:27] revelation the woman is now speaking
[1:00:30] amen when zechariah is dumb
[1:00:34] and she said and then she said
[1:00:37] in verse 45 and blessed is she that
[1:00:39] believed for there shall be a
[1:00:40] performance of those things which were
[1:00:42] told her from the lord
[1:00:44] how does she say that how does she
[1:00:46] authority to say that how does she know
[1:00:48] mary believed and how can she guarantee
[1:00:50] that god will do it
[1:00:53] this isn't just human she's under
[1:00:56] inspiration she's filled with the holy
[1:00:58] ghost speaking by the anointing of the
[1:00:59] spirit and god is using a woman to
[1:01:02] declare truths right here in the
[1:01:04] beginning of the new testament
[1:01:07] it's foreshadowing friends it's
[1:01:09] foreshadowing
[1:01:10] and then mary begins to speak out so my
[1:01:13] soul does magnify the lord the spirit
[1:01:16] has rejoiced in god my savior for he he
[1:01:19] hath regarded my lowest state in his
[1:01:21] handmaid for behold from henceforth all
[1:01:23] generation shall call me blessed what's
[1:01:25] mary now speaking mary now is speaking
[1:01:28] god hiding himself in simplicity and
[1:01:30] revealing himself in the same
[1:01:32] god has taken the lowly and exalted and
[1:01:34] he's fed the hungry and the rich go
[1:01:37] hungry and he's fed me
[1:01:39] she's saying god's used nothing to do
[1:01:41] something wonderful god hiding himself
[1:01:43] in simplicity and revealing himself in
[1:01:45] the same
[1:01:46] and she speaks with boldness so all of
[1:01:48] this is is to me
[1:01:50] foreshadowing what's coming
[1:01:54] so let's go back to genesis 21.
[1:01:59] i want to grab another part and tie it
[1:02:00] in here
[1:02:07] genesis 21
[1:02:10] verse 9.
[1:02:14] in genesis
[1:02:16] we know there's a prophecy coming
[1:02:19] for
[1:02:22] uh
[1:02:23] the seed of abraham
[1:02:25] and god had promised abraham that he'll
[1:02:27] have a seed
[1:02:29] and sarah began to question this
[1:02:32] prophecy whether or not she could bring
[1:02:34] forth she said god has kept it from me
[1:02:36] so obviously you should take my handmaid
[1:02:39] and sarah is the one who comes up with
[1:02:40] the idea of hybriding the word
[1:02:45] because it's the church that hybrids the
[1:02:47] word the female not the male amen it was
[1:02:50] it was eve's idea amen it was sarah's
[1:02:53] idea because we've got to keep this
[1:02:55] theme consistent all the way through the
[1:02:56] scriptures so she said god's withholding
[1:02:58] for me and so now you're supposed to
[1:03:00] take hagar and and abraham does produces
[1:03:03] ishmael and brother memphis said which
[1:03:04] was a wild which was a wild man amen so
[1:03:08] now sarah with her plan with her
[1:03:10] reasonings with her ideas she convinces
[1:03:13] abraham to hybrid the word
[1:03:16] she's guilty for hybridization
[1:03:19] but then god comes down and and he and
[1:03:22] he meets with abraham he comes to the
[1:03:24] plains of memory confirms the time of
[1:03:26] the promise he tells him that you're
[1:03:28] going to conceive there's a change she
[1:03:30] conceives she brings forth the promised
[1:03:32] son and then she weans him and now
[1:03:35] they're having a celebration they're
[1:03:36] having a feast for the weaning of of
[1:03:39] isaac and in verse 9 it says in sarah
[1:03:41] saul the son of hagar the egyptian which
[1:03:45] she had borne unto abraham mocking
[1:03:47] [Music]
[1:03:48] therefore she said unto abram cast out
[1:03:50] this bondwoman with her son for the son
[1:03:52] of this bondwoman shall not be heir with
[1:03:54] my son even with isaac
[1:03:57] and the thing was very grievous in
[1:03:59] abraham's sight because of his son
[1:04:01] and god said unto abraham let it not be
[1:04:03] grievous in thy sight because of the lad
[1:04:05] and because of the bondwoman and all
[1:04:07] that sarah hath said unto thee
[1:04:09] hearken under her voice for an isaac
[1:04:12] shall thy seed be called
[1:04:15] now abraham
[1:04:17] abraham
[1:04:18] is looking at the same woman
[1:04:22] the same woman who caused
[1:04:24] who reasoned the word and caused
[1:04:27] hybridization
[1:04:30] the same church the same do you
[1:04:32] understand
[1:04:33] the same woman now something happens
[1:04:37] amen when jehovah when god comes down in
[1:04:40] flesh
[1:04:41] and after god comes down in flesh and
[1:04:44] reveals his plan amen something changes
[1:04:47] in sarah and now you have a change sarah
[1:04:49] who has conceived on the word and has
[1:04:51] brought forth the promised son and
[1:04:53] something now has changed from the
[1:04:55] reasoning and hybridization now she's
[1:04:58] conceived on the word and brought forth
[1:05:00] the promised son and now she says to
[1:05:03] abraham cast out this bondwoman and her
[1:05:05] son for that son shall not be heir with
[1:05:08] my child
[1:05:11] with what has come forth from me with
[1:05:13] the purity of the promise that's coming
[1:05:14] forth from me that mixed thing will not
[1:05:17] be
[1:05:18] joint heir with this and abraham amen as
[1:05:21] a man is taken back and he's saying
[1:05:23] because you know it was your idea to
[1:05:25] begin with and all of this but there's
[1:05:27] been a transition that takes place on
[1:05:29] the plains of mammary and after the
[1:05:31] transition takes place and she's
[1:05:33] conceived and produced and brought forth
[1:05:35] the promised son now when she speaks to
[1:05:38] abraham god says don't worry
[1:05:40] listen to the words of your wife hearken
[1:05:43] to the voice of sarah
[1:05:47] so let's read it i want to read it and i
[1:05:48] want to be careful that we read it
[1:05:50] verse 12 and god said to abram let not
[1:05:52] it be grievous in thy sight because of
[1:05:54] the lad and because of the bond woman
[1:05:56] and all that sarah has said unto thee
[1:05:58] hearken unto her voice for an isaac
[1:06:01] shall thy seed be called
[1:06:03] hearken under her voice
[1:06:06] now turn with me to galatians 4.
[1:06:12] galatians
[1:06:15] chapter 4.
[1:06:20] in verse 30.
[1:06:24] nevertheless what saith the scripture
[1:06:27] cast out the bondwoman and her son
[1:06:30] for the son of the bondwoman shall not
[1:06:32] be heir with the son of the free woman
[1:06:35] the apostle paul says nevertheless what
[1:06:38] saith the scripture
[1:06:40] not what saith sarah
[1:06:43] what saith the scripture what sarah said
[1:06:47] was the word of god and became the
[1:06:50] scriptures
[1:06:52] and the apostle paul picks up and
[1:06:53] doesn't say now remember what sarah says
[1:06:55] he says doth not the scripture say cast
[1:06:59] out the bondwoman and and now paul is
[1:07:02] using it in a different application he's
[1:07:04] bringing into a spiritual application to
[1:07:06] deal with idolatry
[1:07:09] and where did he get that scripture he
[1:07:11] got it from sarah the same one that
[1:07:13] before her change before god coming in
[1:07:16] flesh before conceiving on the word she
[1:07:18] was the very one who hybrid the word
[1:07:20] amen now something changed in sarah amen
[1:07:23] and now sarah was turned back young
[1:07:26] again
[1:07:28] what do you mean by turning back young
[1:07:30] again
[1:07:31] oh praise god let's let's write
[1:07:33] something
[1:07:34] i don't know what i'm going to do here
[1:07:38] nope not that
[1:07:40] all right
[1:07:44] sarah
[1:07:49] had grown old
[1:07:51] through time
[1:07:52] [Music]
[1:07:53] hybrid the word couldn't produce
[1:07:56] but in order to produce she had to be
[1:07:58] turned back young again
[1:08:01] and brother branham comes to the end of
[1:08:02] the latest ian church age
[1:08:04] with a church that had hybrid the word
[1:08:07] that had grown old and can no longer
[1:08:09] produce
[1:08:11] and what does that church have to do it
[1:08:13] has to be turned back
[1:08:15] young again like it was at pentecost
[1:08:19] so see the type
[1:08:21] that church the church at the end has to
[1:08:24] be turned back amen and go back to what
[1:08:28] that church was before the church ages
[1:08:30] started there was 20 years amen from
[1:08:32] from the day of pentecost until the
[1:08:34] church age started in a.d 53 and in that
[1:08:37] time you had a church amen where
[1:08:39] individuals were baptized in the holy
[1:08:41] ghost they were born again they lived by
[1:08:43] the spirit amen they didn't have strict
[1:08:45] order strict rule they didn't have they
[1:08:47] didn't have necessarily church buildings
[1:08:49] and
[1:08:50] denominations and bishops and
[1:08:53] hierarchies amen they had men called of
[1:08:56] god people who recognized the call of
[1:08:58] god amen the preaching going forward
[1:09:00] knowing inside that that's true amen
[1:09:02] what was it it was all the spirit
[1:09:04] working in the speaker and they hear the
[1:09:06] spirit moving and the spirit putting in
[1:09:08] position and moving in position
[1:09:10] it wasn't an order it wasn't a ritual it
[1:09:13] wasn't a form it wasn't nicholatinism
[1:09:17] it wasn't hybrid yet it wasn't
[1:09:19] man-ordered
[1:09:22] it was spirit-led church
[1:09:26] and now
[1:09:27] in order for sarah to bring forth the
[1:09:29] promised son she's got to be turned back
[1:09:31] young again
[1:09:32] and for this church to receive the
[1:09:34] promised son
[1:09:36] it's got to be turned back young again
[1:09:39] what it was at pentecost
[1:09:42] before the church ages before the
[1:09:44] falling away amen what what was that
[1:09:47] cloud representing when you see that
[1:09:49] cloud that's him what's him it's the
[1:09:51] fullness of the holy ghost that had been
[1:09:53] bound amen from the these denominational
[1:09:56] rivers bound by chains of creeds and
[1:09:58] dogmas and doctrines of men but loosed
[1:10:00] in the evening time by the evening time
[1:10:02] message amen the holy ghost back in the
[1:10:04] church again
[1:10:06] to do what coming back to bring it back
[1:10:09] to its original condition at pentecost
[1:10:13] so that that church can do what so that
[1:10:16] church can conceive the word and bring
[1:10:18] forth the promised son
[1:10:20] that's where we're at friends that's the
[1:10:22] transition sarah made and when sarah
[1:10:24] made that transition now she recognized
[1:10:27] i will not tolerate hybridization
[1:10:33] what do you mean you're the one who's
[1:10:35] guilty i may have been guilty of it
[1:10:37] before but i'm changed now i'm not the
[1:10:39] same sir i was sarah i did that sarah is
[1:10:42] here now
[1:10:45] she went through a change she got a name
[1:10:47] change amen and this bride got a name
[1:10:49] change from church to bride amen she was
[1:10:51] turned back amen to what she was when
[1:10:53] she first married abraham when they were
[1:10:55] young and capable of producing
[1:10:58] but it had fallen through seven church
[1:11:00] ages and grown old and now now infertile
[1:11:03] and all of those things but now there's
[1:11:05] a change coming comes with a name change
[1:11:09] comes a body change where the body of
[1:11:12] christ is changed back to what it was
[1:11:14] when it was first supposed to be married
[1:11:16] to christ
[1:11:19] i love the word
[1:11:22] amen
[1:11:23] i love the word
[1:11:26] where was individuals
[1:11:28] catching revelation and being born again
[1:11:31] by the spirit of god
[1:11:35] and when she sarah went through that
[1:11:37] transition
[1:11:40] she now could recognize
[1:11:43] that that child
[1:11:45] cannot be a joint heir with this child
[1:11:49] that old denominational thinking cast it
[1:11:52] out
[1:11:53] that way i used to think cast it out
[1:11:56] that thing i used to think was a good
[1:11:58] idea cast it out that that thing my
[1:12:01] father's dead and my uncles and my aunts
[1:12:03] and my grand cast it out
[1:12:06] cast it out she had come to the place
[1:12:08] when she was turned back and brought
[1:12:10] forth the son she could recognize the
[1:12:12] detrimental devastating act of
[1:12:14] hybridizing the word and she said get it
[1:12:16] out she could recognize what reasoning
[1:12:18] would produce she said get it out
[1:12:19] because what did reasoning produce
[1:12:22] reasoning produced a mocker of the seed
[1:12:25] a mocker of the seed that'll mock and
[1:12:27] make fun of somebody that believes what
[1:12:29] the prophet said that believes amen that
[1:12:31] he went beyond the the the and we went
[1:12:33] beyond the curtain of time and when he
[1:12:35] went beyond the curtain of time he saw
[1:12:37] bodies up there that he could touch and
[1:12:38] handle and he said i saw all of you over
[1:12:40] there and you say i believe that's true
[1:12:42] for me too
[1:12:44] and the hybridization will produce
[1:12:46] mockers of that
[1:12:50] hybridization will produce mockers amen
[1:12:52] who mock at the truths that we hold dear
[1:12:57] but
[1:12:58] she had the promised son
[1:13:00] she had went through the chain she had
[1:13:02] conceived on the word she was producing
[1:13:04] the word
[1:13:05] and she could say
[1:13:06] we're not going to tolerate
[1:13:08] hybridization
[1:13:11] one time i thought that was right but
[1:13:13] now i know it's wrong
[1:13:16] at one time that was my idea but it's
[1:13:18] not my idea no more
[1:13:21] that was the old me not the new me
[1:13:25] oh praise god she had a transition in
[1:13:27] her life
[1:13:28] we got to have a transition in our life
[1:13:30] and this bride has gone through a
[1:13:31] transition
[1:13:33] back to what it was
[1:13:36] and now when sarah
[1:13:38] what caused sarah to say that
[1:13:44] she said cast out
[1:13:47] the bondwoman and her child
[1:13:50] for the child of the bombing shall not
[1:13:51] be heir with my child
[1:13:54] the apostle paul tells us that was
[1:13:56] scripture
[1:13:59] and when abraham
[1:14:00] when god comes to abraham because
[1:14:02] abraham's troubled about it god tells
[1:14:04] abraham hearken to the voice of thy wife
[1:14:09] because she's speaking scriptures
[1:14:15] why because the old testament is
[1:14:16] foreshadowing our day
[1:14:20] amen this is not the time
[1:14:22] for new scriptures
[1:14:25] this is the time for recognizing the
[1:14:27] mystery under the water
[1:14:32] god
[1:14:33] literally told abraham to listen to her
[1:14:40] listen to her
[1:14:42] and paul picks it up
[1:14:46] see it's interesting to me that it's
[1:14:48] laying there in shadow form because god
[1:14:52] had come to abraham how many times and
[1:14:54] spoke to him directly spoke to him in
[1:14:56] dream met him in person come to him in
[1:14:58] flesh
[1:15:00] god could have said cast out the
[1:15:02] bondwoman
[1:15:03] but in the dispensation they were in
[1:15:06] god's voice was going to come through a
[1:15:09] woman
[1:15:11] and that woman said
[1:15:13] cast out the bondwoman and her child
[1:15:16] and abraham said i better get it
[1:15:18] straight from god and god said you done
[1:15:20] got it listen to her
[1:15:26] hey amen why because the mantle has
[1:15:30] fallen from elijah elisha has picked it
[1:15:32] up amen there's been a double portion
[1:15:34] given out amen there was a portion of
[1:15:36] the word that was given out amen and
[1:15:38] tying together the loose ends there was
[1:15:40] seals on the front side of the book and
[1:15:42] seals on the back side of the book
[1:15:44] there was the tying together of all the
[1:15:46] loose ends and the latter rain
[1:15:48] or the former rain the teaching rain
[1:15:50] teaching the bible restoring the truth
[1:15:52] that were lost through paul's time but
[1:15:53] there was going to come a ladder rain
[1:15:55] and the latter rain was going to come at
[1:15:56] the third pool at the opening of the
[1:15:58] word at the revealing of those mystery
[1:16:00] thunders and so that you would have not
[1:16:02] one portion but a double portion former
[1:16:05] reign and ladder reign together
[1:16:08] and the prophet was the first partaker
[1:16:10] of that because he wasn't just malachi 4
[1:16:12] he was also bride
[1:16:14] he fulfilled both roles he was also part
[1:16:16] of the bride i mean he like john also
[1:16:18] took the book and ate it and prophesied
[1:16:20] again
[1:16:21] but we're going to take that same
[1:16:22] journey and now now we find out that
[1:16:25] we've got to come take the book and eat
[1:16:27] the book and get the double portion of
[1:16:30] the word that was written on the outside
[1:16:33] of the pyramid and what was on the white
[1:16:35] stone on the inside that light never
[1:16:37] shown on this with no writing it was
[1:16:39] going to be a mystery that was revealed
[1:16:40] at the end there's a double portion in
[1:16:43] this pyramid
[1:16:44] there's the portion on the outside and
[1:16:46] there's a portion on the inside and
[1:16:48] we've come to the day where the bride
[1:16:50] gets the double portion because the
[1:16:52] spirit that was in elijah which is the
[1:16:54] lord jesus christ is now in the bride
[1:16:58] and the bride has the double portion the
[1:17:00] former and the former and latter reign
[1:17:03] together
[1:17:05] and now she is taking the word the sword
[1:17:09] of the word the mantle of the prophet
[1:17:11] and she is opening the word and saying
[1:17:13] see it here and see it here and see it
[1:17:16] here and see it here can you see the
[1:17:18] stones here do you see the stones here
[1:17:21] do you see the stones there can you see
[1:17:23] the stone how is she doing it she can't
[1:17:25] do it without a mantle
[1:17:29] why do you read so many quotes brother
[1:17:31] chad because that's the mantle you've
[1:17:33] got to take the mantle and strike the
[1:17:35] word with the mantle amen because elisha
[1:17:38] has no mantle elisha has no ability it's
[1:17:41] got to come from elijah's mantle but
[1:17:43] elijah's mantle striking the word will
[1:17:46] open the word at the same spirit as in
[1:17:49] elisha that was in elijah
[1:17:53] and now when she starts to say do you
[1:17:54] see it there do you see it there do you
[1:17:56] see it there do you see it there you can
[1:17:58] say wait a minute i want to get it from
[1:18:00] god
[1:18:01] [Applause]
[1:18:03] you're getting it from god
[1:18:07] amen if god's going to speak in this
[1:18:08] generation how's he going to do it the
[1:18:10] spirit and the bride are saying come
[1:18:14] well i don't trust that i don't want any
[1:18:15] man injected i don't want any human
[1:18:17] beings involved in this
[1:18:20] then throw your bible out the door
[1:18:23] because it all came through human beings
[1:18:29] god is still using human beings he's
[1:18:31] still using flesh vessels tabernacles of
[1:18:34] flesh he used elijah he used elisha he
[1:18:36] used john the baptist he used william
[1:18:38] branham he's using his bride now and the
[1:18:40] spirit and the bride are saying come and
[1:18:42] you say i want to get it from the spirit
[1:18:44] the spirit and the bride are saying come
[1:18:46] he has a mouthpiece on the earth today
[1:18:48] and that mouthpiece is in the bride
[1:18:50] she's the final voice to the final age
[1:18:52] amen no more sitting by myself refusing
[1:18:55] to be part of the bride refusing to be
[1:18:57] part of the body
[1:19:00] getting it for myself i just want myself
[1:19:02] just me me me me that's nothing but
[1:19:04] stinking pride
[1:19:10] praise god
[1:19:12] why
[1:19:13] because god told us how he's going to
[1:19:15] speak in this day
[1:19:17] he showed it in the old testament
[1:19:20] he's brought it through the prophet's
[1:19:22] ministry he's typed it all over the
[1:19:24] place he's wrote it in the book of
[1:19:26] revelation
[1:19:29] you realize
[1:19:31] the whole bible's telling the same story
[1:19:37] let's turn to judges chapter four i want
[1:19:39] to close
[1:19:40] right here i think
[1:19:42] i just want to lay this in
[1:19:45] judges chapter four
[1:19:48] i'm telling you years ago
[1:19:51] this bothered me
[1:19:55] so bad
[1:19:58] a few years ago
[1:19:59] the portion of scripture i want to read
[1:20:01] to you now i wished wasn't in the bible
[1:20:06] and now
[1:20:07] i'm so thankful that it's in the bible
[1:20:10] because god has opened my eyes to why
[1:20:12] it's in the bible
[1:20:13] you look at the book of judges god is
[1:20:15] raising up judges men men to rule over
[1:20:17] people men to be prophets to bring forth
[1:20:19] the word to give instructions from
[1:20:21] jehovah to the people and they become a
[1:20:23] mouthpiece for god and a ruler over the
[1:20:25] people and of all of these judges that
[1:20:28] are in the book of judges there's 12 of
[1:20:29] them listed there's one that's a woman
[1:20:34] and
[1:20:36] early in the message when i would begin
[1:20:37] to talk to people about women preachers
[1:20:39] and they say what about deborah i'm like
[1:20:40] i wish that ever wasn't in the bible
[1:20:45] because i had no understanding
[1:20:47] everything's there for a reason it's
[1:20:49] placed where it's placed it's there for
[1:20:51] a reason god had to have one of them
[1:20:54] judges to be a woman because he's
[1:20:55] showing at the end time he's going to be
[1:20:57] speaking through a woman it's going to
[1:20:59] be the feminine of jesus christ that's
[1:21:01] speaking in this day
[1:21:04] so if you were going to come
[1:21:06] to our day
[1:21:09] which chapter and judges would you put
[1:21:11] deborah
[1:21:13] lion ox man or eagle
[1:21:17] stalk
[1:21:18] tassel shuck or wheat
[1:21:21] amen
[1:21:23] justification saying the gates baptist
[1:21:25] or the holy ghost himself i'm just
[1:21:27] giving you tips hence
[1:21:31] if you were going to put deborah in
[1:21:32] there declaring the day we lived in the
[1:21:34] stage we are in the restoration of the
[1:21:36] bride tree
[1:21:37] back to fruit again where the seed is
[1:21:39] which chapter would you put this woman
[1:21:42] who's going to judge israel
[1:21:44] chapter 4
[1:21:46] what verse would you mention her name
[1:21:48] first
[1:21:50] 4
[1:21:53] judges chapter 4 verse 4.
[1:21:56] and deborah a prophetess the wife
[1:22:00] of lipidoth
[1:22:01] she judged israel at that time and she
[1:22:04] dwelt under the palm tree of deborah
[1:22:06] between rhema and bethel and mount
[1:22:08] ephraim and the children of israel came
[1:22:10] up to her for judgment
[1:22:13] do you know how many lovers of women
[1:22:15] preachers love this scripture
[1:22:21] they've totally misplaced it
[1:22:23] said deborah could never be a priest
[1:22:26] she was a prophetess
[1:22:29] she could never be a priest or be a
[1:22:31] preacher she was a prophetess because
[1:22:33] when john takes the book in revelations
[1:22:35] 10 8 and eats it in revelation 10 11 he
[1:22:38] is to prophesy again
[1:22:41] elizabeth could not become the priest
[1:22:43] her husband's mouth was shot but under
[1:22:45] inspiration she could give forth
[1:22:47] prophetic words
[1:22:50] so he got it
[1:22:54] so look in verse four she's there in
[1:22:56] verse five she dwelt under the palm tree
[1:22:58] of deborah
[1:23:00] between rhema and bethel and mount
[1:23:01] ephraim now if you notice ephraim was
[1:23:05] the second son of joseph joseph is a
[1:23:07] perfect type of christ
[1:23:09] and out of out of joseph comes to
[1:23:11] manassen ephraim and when when israel
[1:23:14] goes to bless them he crosses his hands
[1:23:16] brother iran said signifying the cross
[1:23:18] where at the cross he goes from jew to
[1:23:20] gentile amen and he puts the blessing of
[1:23:23] the right hand on ephraim the gentile
[1:23:26] because he will be before manasseh
[1:23:28] because at the cross god will turn from
[1:23:30] the jews to the gentiles so ephraim
[1:23:32] always depicts the gentiles
[1:23:36] so where is deborah living
[1:23:38] on mount ephraim on gentile mountain
[1:23:45] and she's living
[1:23:47] between
[1:23:48] rhema
[1:23:50] and bethel
[1:23:52] she's not in bethel and she's not in
[1:23:54] rhema she's in between rhema and bethel
[1:23:57] and bethel means
[1:23:59] the house of god and the house of god
[1:24:02] bethel is on the border of ephraim where
[1:24:05] ephraim which is gentile ephraim
[1:24:09] house of god
[1:24:10] borders benjamin
[1:24:13] benjamin represents the 144th 000
[1:24:17] and rhema is a city in the northernmost
[1:24:20] part of benjamin and bethel is a city in
[1:24:22] the southernmost part of ephraim you
[1:24:25] have gentiles and 144 000 and deborah
[1:24:28] the prophetess in the fourth chapter in
[1:24:30] the first voice the fourth stage is in
[1:24:33] between the church age dispensation and
[1:24:36] the 144 thousand
[1:24:38] which is exactly where she shows up in
[1:24:40] revelations 10 10 1-7 the 7th church
[1:24:44] aged messenger closing out the laodicean
[1:24:46] church age moving into verse 8 8-11 then
[1:24:50] chapter 11 verse 1 and 2 is the ministry
[1:24:53] of prophesying again
[1:24:55] and then verse 3 and chapter 11 goes to
[1:24:58] the two witnesses to go to benjamin so
[1:25:01] in between the gentile dispensation and
[1:25:04] benjamin in between the ephraim and
[1:25:07] bethel and rhema and benjamin comes this
[1:25:10] prophetess named deborah who is the bee
[1:25:14] because the bee labors to bring forth
[1:25:16] honey because the word is sweet in thy
[1:25:19] mouth and bitter in thy belly
[1:25:23] who's laboring to bring forth the honey
[1:25:25] from the word today it's the bride of
[1:25:27] jesus christ that has taken the book and
[1:25:29] ate the book and prophesying again
[1:25:32] what is she she's the bee she's the
[1:25:34] prophetess she's under the palm tree of
[1:25:36] deborah the poem always signifies
[1:25:39] righteousness the righteous line and the
[1:25:41] righteous line under the palm
[1:25:43] between
[1:25:45] the church ages
[1:25:47] and 144 000
[1:25:50] the bible has been foreshadowing our day
[1:25:54] all the way through
[1:25:56] sarah now giving the scriptures
[1:26:00] deborah now judging israel
[1:26:04] all these things that seemed odd
[1:26:07] zechariah having his mouth shut and
[1:26:09] elizabeth prophesying under the
[1:26:10] anointing of the holy ghost
[1:26:12] [Music]
[1:26:14] what is it
[1:26:16] it's the bride age
[1:26:19] it's the bride age
[1:26:21] and in the bright age there's gonna have
[1:26:22] to be a bride who takes the book
[1:26:26] and eats the book
[1:26:28] sees that elijah is gone
[1:26:31] his ministry is complete he's gone but
[1:26:33] his mantle is here
[1:26:37] elijah himself left
[1:26:40] but he left his mantle
[1:26:42] his prophetic ministry
[1:26:45] and the spirit that was in elijah come
[1:26:48] back on elisha on the bride
[1:26:52] and a double portion of grace
[1:26:55] grace
[1:26:57] not just grace to be saved in this day
[1:26:59] but grace for a body change
[1:27:02] double grace
[1:27:05] resurrection
[1:27:07] and rapturing grace
[1:27:11] where are we standing
[1:27:13] revelation 10
[1:27:16] between 10-7 and 11-3
[1:27:21] between the seventh church age messenger
[1:27:24] and the two witnesses
[1:27:27] where are you standing
[1:27:28] between bethel and rhema
[1:27:34] who's between bethel and rhema
[1:27:36] deborah the fourth judge
[1:27:39] and the fourth chapter in the fourth
[1:27:41] verse
[1:27:44] it's almost like god wanted somebody to
[1:27:46] catch it
[1:27:50] it's almost like he hit it in a certain
[1:27:52] way that he'd make sure that somebody
[1:27:54] catched it and everybody else missed it
[1:28:00] brother bam says
[1:28:02] would the bride of christ
[1:28:04] have a ministry before the rapture
[1:28:07] question to brother branham and
[1:28:08] questions and answers 1963
[1:28:10] questions and answers on the seals said
[1:28:13] sure that's what's going on right now
[1:28:16] the bride of christ certainly it's the
[1:28:18] message of the hour the bride of christ
[1:28:19] sure she's consisted of apostles
[1:28:21] prophets teachers evangelists and
[1:28:23] pastors is that right that's the bride
[1:28:24] of christ sure she's got a ministry a
[1:28:26] great ministry it's the ministry of the
[1:28:28] hour it'll be so humble
[1:28:32] and the resume of the age he says i
[1:28:33] sincerely believe that the spirit of god
[1:28:35] has been speaking to us not only
[1:28:37] teaching us the truths of the ages but
[1:28:39] he has been faithfully dealing with the
[1:28:41] hearts that they may turn to him that is
[1:28:43] the reason for all the preaching and
[1:28:44] teaching
[1:28:45] for it is in the preaching and teaching
[1:28:47] of the word that the sheep hear the
[1:28:49] voice of god and follow him
[1:28:53] it's in listen it's in the preaching and
[1:28:55] teaching of the word
[1:28:58] that they hear the voice of god and
[1:29:00] follow him
[1:29:02] so you cannot be speaking the voice of
[1:29:04] god without preaching teaching the word
[1:29:08] in 1965 the seed is not there with the
[1:29:10] shuck he says jesus said no man can come
[1:29:12] to me except my father draws him
[1:29:15] and all that my father hath given me
[1:29:17] they will come my sheep my doves hear my
[1:29:19] voice a stranger they will not follow
[1:29:21] and what is the voice of god
[1:29:24] is the word of god
[1:29:26] what's any man's voice but his word it's
[1:29:29] the word of god they'll hear the word of
[1:29:31] god how will they hear the word of god
[1:29:34] because that's god's voice is his word
[1:29:37] amen and his word is being preached and
[1:29:39] taught amen by the bride of jesus christ
[1:29:42] it's a great ministry
[1:29:44] it's a great ministry in this hour
[1:29:48] let's go i want to read two scriptures
[1:29:49] and then we'll close
[1:29:51] first corinthians 14.
[1:29:54] first corinthians 14.
[1:30:06] first corinthians 14 1
[1:30:12] follow after charity and desire
[1:30:14] spiritual gifts
[1:30:16] but rather that you may prophesy
[1:30:18] for he that speaketh in an unknown
[1:30:19] tongue speaketh not unto men but unto
[1:30:21] god for no man understandeth him how be
[1:30:24] it in the spirit he speaketh mysteries
[1:30:26] but he that prophesies speaketh unto men
[1:30:28] to edification and to exhortation and
[1:30:30] comfort
[1:30:31] he that speaketh in an unknown tongue
[1:30:33] edifieth himself but he that prophesied
[1:30:35] edifieth the church
[1:30:37] i would that you all spake with tongues
[1:30:40] but rather
[1:30:42] yes
[1:30:43] rather
[1:30:44] paul's saying i wish you had all the
[1:30:45] gifts i wish everyone and death but
[1:30:48] rather rather than any of the others
[1:30:50] rather than that i would rather that you
[1:30:52] prophesied
[1:30:54] for greater is he that prophesieth than
[1:30:56] he that speaketh with tongues except ye
[1:30:58] interpret that the church may receive
[1:31:01] edifying
[1:31:03] this word prophet
[1:31:06] prophesy
[1:31:07] it's used in the traditional way of a
[1:31:09] prophet to be a prophet to speak forth
[1:31:11] by divine inspiration to predict
[1:31:14] the idea of foretelling future events
[1:31:16] but then there's another usage and
[1:31:18] definition
[1:31:19] to utter forth declare a thing which can
[1:31:22] only be known by divine revelation
[1:31:27] i would do you all speak with tongues
[1:31:29] but rather that you prophesy because if
[1:31:31] you prophesy you speak to the edifying
[1:31:33] of the whole body
[1:31:35] amen prophesying is not just amen a
[1:31:38] traditional prophet comes and tells you
[1:31:40] something will happen next week but
[1:31:41] prophesying is to declare something from
[1:31:43] the word by divine inspiration and
[1:31:46] revelation
[1:31:48] and paul said i would that you all speak
[1:31:50] with jones but rather that you all
[1:31:52] prophesy because when you come down to
[1:31:55] the end amen it's john who takes the
[1:31:57] little book and prophesies again
[1:32:01] it's deborah in the fourth stage the
[1:32:03] fourth the fourth judge who is
[1:32:06] prophesying to israel
[1:32:10] and in revelation 19
[1:32:13] it says the testimony of jesus
[1:32:16] is the spirit of prophecy
[1:32:19] what is the spirit of prophecy
[1:32:21] the testimony of jesus
[1:32:23] how do you testify of jesus jesus christ
[1:32:27] is the word
[1:32:30] he is the word for this day
[1:32:34] and the testimony of the word for your
[1:32:37] day
[1:32:38] i'm not trying to add to the scriptures
[1:32:40] i'm just
[1:32:41] the testimony of the word for your day
[1:32:43] is the spirit of prophecy
[1:32:47] eat the book
[1:32:48] and prophesy again
[1:32:51] testify
[1:32:53] about him
[1:32:55] who is he
[1:32:56] he's the word that's been revealed in
[1:32:58] our day that's him
[1:33:01] how do you see him we don't look for
[1:33:02] nail scars we look for the word made
[1:33:04] manifest if you can't see the revealed
[1:33:07] word you can't see him
[1:33:10] he is the word revealed in this day
[1:33:18] praise be to god
[1:33:19] let's all stand
[1:33:25] musicians if you'd like to come
[1:33:28] you may have been guilty in the past
[1:33:31] of hybridizing the word
[1:33:34] i was
[1:33:36] you may be guilty of taking reasoning to
[1:33:38] the word
[1:33:39] i was
[1:33:42] but the same one who was guilty of
[1:33:45] reasoning the promise and hybridizing
[1:33:46] the word the same one after an encounter
[1:33:50] on the planes of memory in a change and
[1:33:53] a conception could look at that thing
[1:33:54] and says cast that out
[1:33:57] cast it out but you said cast it out but
[1:34:00] it was your idea cast it out
[1:34:02] but you were fine with it last week cast
[1:34:04] it out something in me has changed
[1:34:10] why because sarah was now
[1:34:13] speaking the word of god
[1:34:16] sarah was now speaking
[1:34:18] what paul would call
[1:34:20] scriptures
[1:34:24] oh praise god i love the word of god
[1:34:26] amen
[1:34:28] showing us foreshadowing our day showing
[1:34:31] us where we're at
[1:34:33] the mantle has fallen friends
[1:34:36] have you seen elijah go
[1:34:38] did you see him go
[1:34:40] i want to tell you it's a good thing if
[1:34:42] he goes
[1:34:46] i mean those prophets they thought it
[1:34:48] was a bad thing
[1:34:51] those 50 prophets those school of the
[1:34:53] prophets they thought it was a bad thing
[1:34:55] that elijah was going
[1:34:58] but if elijah didn't go
[1:35:00] that spirit wouldn't come upon elisha
[1:35:03] and elisha wouldn't take that mantle
[1:35:05] himself
[1:35:06] until elijah was gone elisha was
[1:35:09] following around elijah
[1:35:11] doing
[1:35:13] nothing there was nothing written about
[1:35:15] what elisha did other than later it says
[1:35:17] he poured hands on he poured water on
[1:35:19] the hands of elijah
[1:35:23] but elisha saw elijah go
[1:35:26] and i think it's important it's noted
[1:35:28] for a reason
[1:35:30] have you seen elijah go
[1:35:34] then where did that spirit go
[1:35:36] where did that spirit of the lord jesus
[1:35:38] christ that was in that vessel where did
[1:35:40] it
[1:35:40] go
[1:35:42] it's in his bride
[1:35:44] and he left the mantle 1200 tapes
[1:35:48] he left the mantle and the spirit is
[1:35:51] here that can take that mantle and
[1:35:53] strike the word and open it up and when
[1:35:56] you see that you know where the spirit
[1:35:58] of elijah is
[1:36:00] when you see that you know where the
[1:36:01] spirit of the lord jesus christ is
[1:36:04] don't be fooled by trickery and things
[1:36:06] you see with your eyes and big flashes
[1:36:08] and exciting things watch for the
[1:36:10] opening of the word amen
[1:36:12] because christ is always declaring his
[1:36:14] presence by the opening of the word by
[1:36:16] the breaking of bread
[1:36:19] and their eyes were opened when he broke
[1:36:20] the bread
[1:36:22] and they saw who he was
[1:36:25] when he opened the word they recognized
[1:36:27] it was he when the seals came open only
[1:36:30] the lamb can open the seals when the
[1:36:32] seals came open it recognized who was
[1:36:34] the one that was breaking the seals
[1:36:38] christ is revealed by the opening of the
[1:36:40] word
[1:36:41] find out
[1:36:42] find the place where the opening of the
[1:36:44] word is
[1:36:46] and that's where that spirit is resting
[1:36:49] god
[1:36:51] i say it this way
[1:36:54] i would you all speak with tongues
[1:36:57] but rather
[1:36:58] i would rather that we all eat the book
[1:37:01] and prophesy again
[1:37:03] amen let's bow our heads and pray
[1:37:06] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[1:37:08] for this word
[1:37:10] and god
[1:37:11] when we look at it we know it's true
[1:37:14] it's in too much detail it's in too much
[1:37:16] perfection it's in it's in so many
[1:37:19] places and in every jot and tittle and
[1:37:21] names of cities and places of scriptures
[1:37:24] and numerology it's everywhere it's
