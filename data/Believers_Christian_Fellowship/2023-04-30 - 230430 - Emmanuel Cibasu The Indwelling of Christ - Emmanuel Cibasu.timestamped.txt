[14:42] move and come and speak to us
[14:45] Lord is a little person
[14:50] have Lord done the best I could to look
[14:53] into your word and read some scriptures
[14:55] here read this written word from your
[14:58] prophet
[15:00] put the verses together the quotations
[15:03] together
[15:05] but Lord that's just a letter
[15:07] it will take you to come
[15:10] it will take you to come to interpret it
[15:12] when you're interpreting it that's the
[15:15] word we can hear it
[15:16] and we can live by it
[15:19] we just ask that father you will take
[15:21] your Liberty and you'll have your way
[15:24] that Lord whatsoever is mining tiny as
[15:29] it might be from you Lord that it will
[15:31] give us the strength for another day
[15:34] we just surrender all that we are to you
[15:38] and that you would have complete control
[15:40] in Jesus Christ then we pray amen
[15:45] Physicians thank you and God bless you
[15:49] greetings to all of you
[15:52] so glad to see you this morning
[15:56] your presence here is already a piece of
[16:00] the word that you are fulfilling in your
[16:02] life
[16:03] just the assembling of the the Saints
[16:07] as we're still standing up let's take
[16:09] our Bibles and go to
[16:12] the book of Hebrews chapter 10 verse 24.
[16:17] I while you're trying to do that I have
[16:20] heard my pastor coming here
[16:23] when he's not preaching on Wednesday
[16:25] Sunday he comes after week he said I
[16:28] feel nervous
[16:30] he said what
[16:31] Brother Kyle will come here and say I
[16:34] don't know I only have an hour an hour
[16:36] 10 minutes
[16:38] I don't know what brother Ben would say
[16:40] about that
[16:42] but just put all those together
[16:44] mixed with water with concrete and let
[16:47] it dry that's how I'm feeling right now
[16:49] very heavy
[16:52] will speak to us so Hebrews 10
[16:58] 24-26 and this is just this is not the
[17:01] main scripture for the our film this
[17:04] morning as this is just what we are here
[17:07] to do one another
[17:10] it says and this is Paul speaking it
[17:12] says and let us consider one another
[17:15] to provoke and to love and to Good Works
[17:21] not forsaking the assembling of
[17:23] ourselves together
[17:25] as the manner of some is but exhorting
[17:28] one another in in so much the more as
[17:32] you see the day approaching you may be
[17:34] seated
[17:35] may God bless the reading of his word I
[17:38] just pulled this up and uh so we're here
[17:41] this morning not to bring something new
[17:44] because we know that everything has been
[17:46] old
[17:47] you yourself you are old
[17:51] because you didn't you didn't just come
[17:53] on earth a few years ago
[17:56] I remember brother Brandon could look at
[17:57] his son Billy Paul he said Billy when I
[18:01] was 16 years old the Billy Paul you were
[18:04] in me
[18:05] so what would be Billy's Paul's birthday
[18:08] then
[18:10] because probably he had him on he
[18:12] returned to 24 or 25 so nine years prior
[18:15] to that not only that even when he was a
[18:17] little kid Billy Paul was still inside
[18:20] of him
[18:21] so that you can tell how much old even
[18:23] the seals are not old that are not new
[18:26] everything has been
[18:28] so it's just the Revelation that
[18:30] uncovers it and unveils it for our day
[18:33] and I like the way the prophet of God
[18:35] brings it up and this is just we're
[18:38] family here right this morning we have
[18:40] no big big toes and and smoke toes we're
[18:43] the same here children of God
[18:46] and the prophet of God said this and the
[18:49] message
[18:50] is life worthy of the Gospel in 1963
[18:55] he said we have assembled it together
[18:57] father
[18:58] for no other purpose
[19:02] but to try to learn how to live better
[19:08] and to live closer to you
[19:13] that's our purpose this morning
[19:15] we don't want to show up that say I know
[19:17] better we will never even know so what
[19:20] what we will never know in this world
[19:22] will be just a little dust off of God's
[19:26] Gods maybe foot
[19:27] will never you will hear how the prophet
[19:30] of God tells us
[19:32] for we see the day approaching and we
[19:35] must assemble ourselves together oft and
[19:39] take instruction from you
[19:41] in the possessing all things he
[19:44] reiterate the same thought so our
[19:48] heavenly father thou has chosen that we
[19:51] should gather together
[19:53] it's the will of God
[19:56] today this morning you have gathered
[19:59] together around the world of God
[20:02] this is his will his word
[20:06] it's the will of God that we should
[20:09] assemble ourselves together as we see
[20:12] the day approaching
[20:13] and that regularly Lord to bring
[20:16] ourselves closer to you
[20:19] and closer to each other
[20:22] in a bond of Fellowship through the shed
[20:26] blood of Jesus
[20:27] which makes it possible
[20:33] it's more more deeper than I can even
[20:36] explain it every time we get together
[20:40] there is a portion of a scripture we are
[20:42] fulfilling
[20:44] and the prophet of God said that the
[20:47] only way to stay in Divine Fellowship
[20:50] is to keep that word
[20:54] keeping a piece of God's word is still
[20:57] keeping his word
[20:58] because he said that look what caused
[21:01] all that we have going on today
[21:04] it's just because one little piece of
[21:06] God's word was left up
[21:10] in the message Oneness the prophet of
[21:12] God says now just one little piece of a
[21:15] Commandment that she disobeyed
[21:19] but Adam's bride disobeyed just
[21:23] a little piece of commandment
[21:27] and distorted the whole thing
[21:31] because she did that
[21:33] it made every hungry child
[21:38] that was ever in the world
[21:40] every pain of death
[21:43] every sorrow
[21:45] we're just naming them to see what
[21:48] living out a little piece of commandment
[21:52] every pain of death every sorrow every
[21:57] heartache she did it right there
[22:03] meaning right when we leave out the
[22:06] Peace of God's commandment just right
[22:09] then
[22:10] we don't know the list of things that we
[22:13] have opened up
[22:18] he continues and said what a horrible
[22:22] thing
[22:23] to disbelieve God's word
[22:27] every person that groans in pain of
[22:32] every death
[22:34] that ever was or ever will be
[22:39] she did it right then
[22:43] that puts away weight
[22:47] on when and how do I have to look at the
[22:51] word of God today
[22:53] regardless on which form which shape it
[22:57] comes to us
[22:58] we should consider it
[23:02] says
[23:03] every little unwitted child she did it
[23:07] right then every child born out of
[23:12] wedlock
[23:14] every sin that was ever committed
[23:20] this is just for about a little piece
[23:22] she left out but look what what we're
[23:24] talking about here
[23:28] I know some of us who have been going
[23:30] maybe through deep pains some we have
[23:33] not even come experienced them some are
[23:36] even greater than we can understand them
[23:37] that this is just because of one little
[23:40] piece of commandment of God
[23:45] everything that was ever committed
[23:49] she caused it right there
[23:52] by doing what
[23:54] the prophet of God Says by keeping every
[23:58] word right down
[24:01] but one little place here
[24:07] she reasoned
[24:12] she kept every word down brother will
[24:16] not even arrived there yet
[24:20] she kept every word down
[24:24] but
[24:25] one little place
[24:28] that makes me
[24:31] just as a human being to be very careful
[24:36] very watchful
[24:40] with anything that pertains to God
[24:44] anything that might be his commandment
[24:47] anything that might be his word
[24:51] because you can we can keep it
[24:54] every word down
[24:57] but one little piece
[25:01] where would it be in my life
[25:04] where would that be in your life
[25:08] because if we have that little peace
[25:11] remaining there
[25:13] it's gonna cause the very same thing
[25:15] because God doesn't change
[25:21] God doesn't change
[25:25] in reasoning I looked up a word
[25:28] reasoning excuse me if I can take this
[25:30] off
[25:34] the word reasoning I looked at it
[25:38] it said I said to think
[25:40] to understand but the most striking was
[25:44] it's to form a judgment
[25:50] by a process of a logic to make it
[25:53] sensible to justify for inaction
[25:58] so when we are
[26:01] reasoning
[26:03] in reality
[26:05] we are forming a judgment
[26:09] now who are you to form a judgment
[26:19] before you can form a judgment
[26:21] you need some kind of authority
[26:28] so
[26:29] Adam's bride
[26:32] by reasoning
[26:34] just one little piece
[26:37] in that little little piece
[26:40] she gave herself an authority
[26:44] to make a judgment
[26:49] now that's
[26:51] the blessing that we have that
[26:55] if God leaves us in the same condition
[26:57] that we can believe down
[27:00] to come to only live one piece out
[27:06] we will be in the same boat
[27:10] but because of his loving kindness
[27:13] his bowels of Mercies
[27:16] he wants things to go back the way they
[27:18] were
[27:19] he sent the word
[27:22] that had never never never
[27:26] the Earth
[27:27] this precious message that we have
[27:30] it is the fullness of God himself
[27:35] haven't given himself to you that I'm
[27:38] giving myself all to you that not even a
[27:42] chance of you missing out a little
[27:45] peace
[27:48] and that should put a price on this
[27:50] message
[27:53] it should put a price on it
[27:56] it's Beauty should become the most
[27:58] valuable valuable thing
[28:02] then even yourself
[28:09] it has come
[28:12] to read out of you and me
[28:16] every attempt
[28:19] to observe Authority
[28:23] every attempt
[28:26] to believe down and live out one piece
[28:32] it's your as we heard last Wednesday
[28:35] it's your security
[28:41] you will never have any other security
[28:45] but this message
[28:50] I like how Wednesday the Lord the Holy
[28:52] Spirit was speaking to us said Christ
[28:55] has come
[28:57] to seek and gather the pieces of himself
[29:01] and for him to do that he has those
[29:04] those no leaks somewhere for a little
[29:07] peace
[29:09] there's no leak
[29:16] so we have come this morning with only
[29:19] one anticipation
[29:21] that whatsoever I have put here
[29:23] scripture called it's a letter
[29:27] that he would
[29:29] use me and use you to speak because he
[29:33] speaks on both ends
[29:36] and when he speaks we can hear his voice
[29:41] and when we hear his word
[29:43] we have everlasting life
[29:46] there's something that struck me it's a
[29:49] in the crisis the mystery of God
[29:51] revealed
[29:52] this is before brother Brandon reads out
[29:55] the scripture to start preaching
[29:58] he's referring to brother Bill down
[30:01] in his mentioning brother tambra
[30:04] so it hits home because we know brother
[30:07] Tom and his beautiful smile before he
[30:10] left us
[30:11] but he's doing like this he's referring
[30:14] to the Book of John the first John
[30:18] 5 24. where Jesus Christ said very
[30:22] verily I say unto you he that Hearth my
[30:26] word and believe it on him that sent me
[30:28] has everlasting life and shall not come
[30:32] into condemnation but it is passed from
[30:34] Death unto life
[30:35] he's saying this
[30:37] just pay attention he hasn't even
[30:40] started preaching yet but he's just
[30:42] talking and checking that there's
[30:43] something deeper there that he's
[30:45] striking he said I'm reading it's uh
[30:47] those that have the book
[30:49] it's uh at the paragraph 18.
[30:54] he's asking in the congregation he's
[30:56] asking hey does any anybody know whether
[30:59] the Dow family and any
[31:02] any of them got down today
[31:05] or not sister down brother Brown are you
[31:08] here brother Brown is asking and brother
[31:12] Thomas speaking to brother Brennan
[31:15] and Tom it says that Tom Brown comments
[31:19] about the brother Bill doll they build
[31:22] those condition
[31:23] and coming down
[31:27] brother REM is laying kind of explaining
[31:30] how brother Builder that was almost left
[31:32] us he was sick and then brother Brennan
[31:35] drove to Lima Ohio to come and visit him
[31:38] he thought that Lima Ohio was just the
[31:40] nearby you hip skip they found out it
[31:43] was far away from Jeffersonville so he's
[31:46] speaking about brother Bill down and
[31:48] then his act there's something that a
[31:51] little conversation that happened
[31:53] between brother Bill down brother
[31:55] Branham
[31:57] and brother Brahm is going to mention it
[31:59] uh he said build out said the other day
[32:03] I was talking to him he said
[32:05] brother man do you think I'm all right
[32:07] brother Brenner
[32:10] little tiny question do you think I'm
[32:14] all right
[32:15] and brother bran comes down to this he
[32:18] said okay brother Bill
[32:22] I said did you ever go to a doctor for a
[32:24] physical checkup
[32:26] he said yes sir
[32:29] I said the doctor will put stethoscope
[32:31] in his ears put them on your heart see
[32:34] if your heart is beating right
[32:39] and electrical cardiogram and the blood
[32:42] pressure or urine test and so forth
[32:45] instruments to find out where your
[32:48] physical
[32:49] being
[32:51] now the way he does that
[32:56] he looks
[32:58] back at a book
[33:01] so he tests you here and then there's a
[33:04] book there he can look at
[33:07] do things from the test to the book
[33:10] maybe your condition might have worsened
[33:13] or maybe have improved so there's no
[33:16] there's always a disconnection between
[33:18] the test and the book
[33:22] and the prophet of God says
[33:25] uh he looks at the book here where
[33:27] Specialists on these different subjects
[33:30] are wrote down
[33:32] if this takes place this is what's wrong
[33:35] I said now the only stethoscope that I
[33:38] have is the Bible
[33:41] which is which is which is something
[33:43] simple because it's the testing the
[33:47] testing and it's the very same book he's
[33:50] going to be reading out
[33:51] it's no more testing stethoscopes and
[33:53] coming to the book now they're combined
[33:55] into one the testing material in the
[33:59] book that stays out the condition or the
[34:02] your healing it's in one
[34:07] needs to get some water he'd say
[34:16] and I said now the only stethoscope I
[34:19] have is the Bible see for the soul and I
[34:23] said I'm going to give you the test
[34:26] I said Saint John 24 5 24 said he that
[34:31] heareth my word
[34:32] I said it didn't just sit and listening
[34:36] so brother Branham is telling us what
[34:39] hearing my word
[34:42] means
[34:44] he said
[34:46] it isn't just sit and listening
[34:49] if we do that
[34:51] it's good
[34:53] but it's not it yet
[34:58] that's receiving it that's hearing
[35:02] it's right
[35:04] it's receiving it you believe it
[35:08] something inside of you tells you it's
[35:12] right
[35:15] that's a hearing the word of God
[35:18] something inside of you your mouth might
[35:21] say Amen your mouth might be shut or
[35:23] anything might be going on but there's
[35:25] something inside of you there that says
[35:28] that's right
[35:32] you've accepted it
[35:35] you believe it
[35:38] it's yours
[35:41] so hearing his word
[35:44] means that it's yours
[35:48] you have possessed it
[35:50] you are one with it
[35:54] he that heareth it's already yours my
[35:59] word and believe him on him that sent me
[36:01] you believe that how many believe that
[36:03] or you've got you've got the whole thing
[36:06] you've got the book
[36:08] never got the book
[36:10] so it's and I just read that
[36:15] just to signify for brother Charlie lamb
[36:18] to me to say that but with the little
[36:21] experience I had last year I think I
[36:25] spoken about that
[36:27] of me passing
[36:29] [Music]
[36:30] on the airplane
[36:33] is something that has become
[36:36] real to me
[36:40] this word
[36:43] I don't take it like something it used
[36:46] to be
[36:48] and I know that some of them are maybe
[36:50] further there but for me personally
[36:54] something has become a reality
[36:57] it's been it's been a reality but it
[37:00] becomes a you cannot tell the level of
[37:03] the reality it has become to you
[37:07] every time sometimes I do not know when
[37:09] brother Chad or a minister and brother
[37:11] preaching here and down there probably I
[37:13] don't know how many times I would say
[37:14] amen I don't count that I might battle
[37:16] someone close to me but it's something
[37:19] that I cannot contain because it has
[37:22] become me
[37:23] every word I could say Amen to every
[37:27] word for a million times if God gives me
[37:30] enough breath in the service because
[37:32] it's something that is a reality inside
[37:36] and I just pray that
[37:38] you become more and more a substance to
[37:41] each and every one of us
[37:45] gonna be reading in the Book of John
[37:48] John first John chapter one
[37:52] I'm 35 to 51 so that's
[37:57] a little verse a few verses we're going
[37:59] to be getting our little subject there
[38:03] John 1
[38:06] we're going to be reading from 35
[38:10] to
[38:15] go 40 41.
[38:22] my Bible saw
[38:23] my glasses are kind of having a glare so
[38:26] sometimes I have to look into this
[38:28] so if you are there we can start reading
[38:33] again the next day
[38:35] after John stood
[38:38] in two of his disciples
[38:41] what I'm reading it's going to be
[38:44] the last the last three days of John's
[38:48] Baptist ministry
[38:51] we know that his ministry was to declare
[38:54] the Lord that was suddenly entered into
[38:56] his Temple
[38:58] he was preparing the way for the Messiah
[39:00] to come
[39:01] and now we we know from the beginning
[39:04] that during his ministry
[39:07] the whole Judea
[39:11] Jerusalem they were going to be baptized
[39:13] of John
[39:15] multitudes have followed his ministry
[39:19] priests cyruses Pharisees Soldiers the
[39:23] people the publicans this the prophet of
[39:26] God describes it as a it was a six-month
[39:29] Revival
[39:32] multitude were after him because they
[39:35] were convinced that this was a prophet
[39:37] something they have never sinned and hit
[39:40] their history because before John there
[39:42] were other prophets but there was a
[39:44] length of time that a prophet had not
[39:47] appeared on the scene yet so John no
[39:50] Miracles is the prophet of God said but
[39:53] just the preaching the the depth of the
[39:56] word words that were coming out of this
[39:58] man that had no no nice clothes on him
[40:02] clothed on him
[40:03] but they knew something was convincing
[40:06] that this was a prophet but here we see
[40:09] him on this last of the three days
[40:13] staying only with two disciples and I
[40:17] know brother Chad and other ministers of
[40:20] touched on this before but I just want
[40:22] to revisit it just to provoke you to
[40:25] love
[40:27] provoke you to Good Good Deeds Good
[40:29] Deeds what is it Lord we show us how to
[40:33] how can we do Good Deeds no it's a
[40:35] believing
[40:36] just to provoke you to God's faith to
[40:39] believe in him
[40:40] so here he is only staying with the two
[40:44] we know the first of the three days he
[40:46] starts with John 1 Chapter verse 19 but
[40:50] we're going to be keeping reading this
[40:51] again the next day after John stood and
[40:55] two of his disciples
[40:58] and he looked Upon Jesus
[41:00] as he walked he said Behold the Lamb of
[41:05] God
[41:08] I like reading the Bible
[41:11] with the lenses of the Revelation I know
[41:14] brother Chad said that I wish God could
[41:15] just erase my memory with the Pinnacle
[41:18] Pentecostal background of what I'm
[41:20] reading because when we have those that
[41:22] are hindering us from even seeing the
[41:23] pictures
[41:25] here is a man a male walking by and John
[41:29] is looking at this male
[41:32] is declaring this is a lamb you would be
[41:35] confused
[41:36] how would the man be become a lamb
[41:40] How could a man become a lamb of God
[41:46] and I know that in the previous
[41:48] um
[41:49] uh versus
[41:52] even some of his disciples left him
[41:56] because it became so strong on them
[42:00] that he is pointing out his second
[42:02] cousin
[42:03] as the Lamb of God
[42:06] I know some of the word there said John
[42:08] we've told with you or these all these
[42:11] months
[42:12] we've been laboring in the ministry
[42:15] and now you're kind of letting us down
[42:17] you are pointing to your second cousin
[42:21] that this is the Lamb of God so we've
[42:24] been wasting our time
[42:29] it was too hard for them to to
[42:31] understand that
[42:33] this is this is a family called this is
[42:36] a family affair here you John pointing
[42:39] to your second cousin declaring that
[42:41] you've been waiting for him you've been
[42:42] waiting to introduce the Messiah and
[42:44] what are we seeing your second cousin
[42:48] there was too much for them to handle
[42:51] they had to fade away
[42:54] so from multitudes the wish to be
[42:56] associated with John multitude vanish
[42:59] the first day
[43:02] when they came from Jerusalem sent by
[43:04] the by the the headquarters the priests
[43:07] these or the priests and the Levites
[43:10] of the Pharisees the Bible stipulated
[43:12] its Pharisees the the the the the
[43:14] strongest the Bold the worst of the
[43:17] worst the Pharisees they came from
[43:20] Jerusalem or you are you the Christ
[43:24] are you Elias are you the prophet no
[43:29] he said I am the voice meaning
[43:32] that's scripture that you see in your
[43:34] school there and I we're one
[43:38] they they couldn't see that
[43:41] they couldn't see that and in another
[43:43] way in another fashion John could have
[43:47] responded to all those three questions
[43:49] with a yes
[43:52] he was not the Christ but yes by just
[43:57] saying that I am the voice that was
[43:58] Christ there
[44:00] because Christ is the interpretation of
[44:03] the word
[44:05] he was not the Christ he was a Christ
[44:09] he could said yes in a form in a sense
[44:12] are you Elias he could say I am a liar
[44:16] but he would not help them
[44:19] because he was fading away he was
[44:22] decreasing
[44:23] he had only one day left he could not
[44:25] point back to himself again
[44:28] are you the prophet I am not the prophet
[44:31] of Deuteronomy you're waiting for but he
[44:34] was a prophet to all those three
[44:37] questions he had a reason to say I am
[44:40] yes to all of them and he would not have
[44:43] helped them
[44:46] he had the greater Mission he was
[44:49] decreasing
[44:51] and for us to understand better what was
[44:53] happening to John let's read what
[44:55] happened to our prophet in this
[44:56] generation
[44:57] in the looking unto Jesus the prophet of
[45:00] God said when Paul was speaking one time
[45:02] to a group of people why they listened
[45:05] to him closely as long as he stayed in
[45:08] the law
[45:09] as long as he went the same way they
[45:12] went they always went it was good
[45:16] but he wants to turn a corner
[45:20] he said but when he began to tell about
[45:23] the revelation of the heavenly vision
[45:26] quickly
[45:27] it changed the congregation
[45:32] this pattern was for John
[45:36] was for brother Branham it's going to be
[45:38] for you and me in life
[45:43] it's going to be the same pattern in
[45:44] your life
[45:45] you're going to have many friends many
[45:47] family members tapping you on the
[45:49] shoulders oh you're the good one you're
[45:50] the the funny one you're the good one
[45:53] but once you start joining yourself with
[45:57] this revelation
[46:01] they're going to be starting pulling
[46:02] away from you
[46:04] even those that who used to love you
[46:06] that oh when he shows up here
[46:07] everybody's going to be laughing they're
[46:08] going to be mad at you because you're no
[46:11] longer their friend
[46:13] you no longer act like them
[46:15] the congregation is going to be fading
[46:17] away on you
[46:19] even in the house in the home
[46:21] there might be things with Christian
[46:23] things that that don't bother us someone
[46:26] could wear a skirt or a son can wear
[46:29] this one said you know what I see with
[46:34] God's word that this is no longer
[46:37] holding
[46:41] family The Clash will be coming into the
[46:45] family the husband might see that first
[46:47] if you see first just know that the
[46:50] Clash is there on your spouse to start
[46:52] pulling away if the
[46:54] the wife sees it first or vice versa
[46:57] the congregation will start fading away
[47:00] on you
[47:02] I know most of you guys you have
[47:04] experiences with the family relatives
[47:06] some cannot even call you to talk to you
[47:08] because you believe a cult
[47:11] because what you believe is hard it's
[47:13] harsh
[47:14] that's that's the reality
[47:16] the bride will have the same pattern
[47:19] they rose up to screaming if they they
[47:23] just listen to what the man said he was
[47:26] revealing the truth of God by the word
[47:29] some time ago in a big city in the in
[47:32] this United States I was invited for a
[47:34] Revival just a few people there that
[47:38] turned out I think he's referring to
[47:40] Chicago meaning in Chicago
[47:43] and I taken my love offering to make the
[47:45] breakfast free
[47:47] to some of the Year communicable
[47:48] Believers there in the city and told
[47:50] them to come out I would like to speak
[47:53] with them and tell them my purpose of
[47:56] being here
[47:59] of being there
[48:01] to help the city to help the sick to
[48:04] help them every Church
[48:06] well that morning when Dr leeville was
[48:10] my speaker at the campaign he had
[48:12] introduced me to the the audience
[48:15] after the breakfast
[48:17] I looked I took this text
[48:20] I was not disobedient to the heavenly
[48:22] vision
[48:23] [Music]
[48:24] just in a moment
[48:26] I noticed a minister look at his watch
[48:30] reached over and nodded his head to the
[48:32] other fellow got up and went out
[48:36] before I had said six or eight words
[48:41] almost a third of that ministerial group
[48:45] had walked out
[48:49] by the time I got to where I could say
[48:52] something about the texts
[48:55] there was just about three or four
[48:59] sitting
[49:01] they all they had all got up and gone
[49:10] the decreasing and the increasing
[49:14] this bride will decrease
[49:17] in the very same way
[49:20] every ministry will take the same
[49:23] pattern
[49:25] every home
[49:27] of a Believer will take the same pattern
[49:33] because the word will not be mixed with
[49:36] nothing else
[49:38] it's a seed that stands out on its own
[49:42] but before two and then let's keep on
[49:45] reading that this is a little bible
[49:47] study have been going on here but
[49:49] there's a mortal to it than what am I
[49:51] even bring here
[49:55] 37.
[49:58] and the two disciples heard him speak so
[50:01] 36 said and looking Upon Jesus as he
[50:04] walked he said Behold the Lamb of God
[50:06] and the two disciples heard him speak
[50:09] and they followed Jesus
[50:12] then Jesus turned and saw them following
[50:15] and said unto them what seek ye
[50:18] they said unto him Rabbi which is to say
[50:21] being interpreted
[50:22] a master where dwelleth thou
[50:26] he said unto them come and see they came
[50:29] and saw were he dwell and Abode with him
[50:32] that day for it was about the tenth hour
[50:35] something strange is in this kind of in
[50:38] these verses the the two John could not
[50:42] explain they knew John it was a Simon's
[50:45] brother Andrew and and another they
[50:48] don't give the name they knew they knew
[50:51] Jesus that he was second cousin to John
[50:54] but they couldn't go
[50:56] they stayed there these two
[50:59] and he's pointing to this male this
[51:01] cousin of his being the lamb they could
[51:04] not explain that maybe they had some
[51:07] references to referring to the Lamb of
[51:10] Isaiah 12 or the the Lamb of Isaiah
[51:16] Exodus 12 or Isaiah 53 11 there was to
[51:20] be to Bear the iniquity of them all but
[51:23] they stayed there
[51:25] and as they are following Jesus
[51:29] it's strange that
[51:32] they were following Jesus and Jesus
[51:35] turned to ask them what they were after
[51:39] now let's take let's wipe out our memory
[51:42] of everything
[51:44] you have the very creator
[51:49] the one who put every cell
[51:52] that were in their bodies
[51:55] who knew their mind
[51:58] he is walking knowing how many chemicals
[52:03] he put in those two bodies
[52:05] how many of calcium were in those two
[52:07] bodies how many of everything now he's
[52:10] turning around to ask a question
[52:15] what kind of question would that be
[52:19] it's just just it's just like Europe
[52:22] having a wound
[52:24] and then the open wound that's hurting
[52:26] so bad
[52:27] and someone comes with a needle inside
[52:29] of that wound pushes them meaning that
[52:32] Jesus knew exactly
[52:35] to pinpoint their question their need
[52:40] and they had responded it
[52:42] to it in a way that it might not even
[52:45] look clear to us
[52:48] but it was exactly what was inside of
[52:51] them
[52:53] he's looking
[52:54] at them
[52:55] what's seeking
[52:57] he knew that deep inside them
[53:01] they were seeking for something
[53:04] they had a question
[53:09] and they answered they said
[53:12] and we will find out
[53:14] that Dwelling Place
[53:16] that's the title a little title of our
[53:19] subject the indwelling the indwelling of
[53:22] Christ
[53:25] and then we see as they give the
[53:27] response
[53:28] he said unto them they said where
[53:31] dwelleth thou
[53:32] he said
[53:33] come
[53:35] and see
[53:36] and that's the best
[53:38] that he could have offered them but for
[53:41] us to to to understand why his even
[53:46] telling them to come that they can see
[53:49] the prophet of God speaks to us about
[53:53] that in in crisis the mystery of God
[53:55] revealed
[53:57] this always blows my mind
[54:00] he said
[54:01] the first thing was that God wanted to
[54:05] reveal himself to the people
[54:09] a great desire from God
[54:12] he couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God
[54:17] who covered all space
[54:21] time
[54:23] and Eternity
[54:29] we already lost there
[54:31] space I'm lost I don't know how far it
[54:34] would go Time We Lost
[54:37] eternity
[54:38] in badly speaking we are lost
[54:41] you're talking about things that cannot
[54:43] be in language of man
[54:45] the mortal
[54:47] he said
[54:48] he couldn't do he couldn't he could not
[54:53] he is too great to ever be revealed to
[54:58] people
[55:01] he wanted to reveal himself to the
[55:03] people
[55:04] but look what dimension he's in
[55:09] he could not
[55:11] he is too great to ever be revealed to
[55:16] people because it would be too
[55:18] mysterious
[55:22] too mysterious
[55:25] how could that great being or now we're
[55:27] taking another level now of
[55:29] understanding how could that great being
[55:32] that never did begin
[55:34] how could you even fathom that
[55:38] that after you went beyond the cycle of
[55:43] a hundred of billions and trillions and
[55:45] trillions of years I mean heard that
[55:48] could you repeat them for me
[55:51] this this this this this is melting me
[55:58] how could that great being that never
[56:00] did begin that after you went beyond the
[56:03] cycle of hundreds of billions and
[56:06] trillion and trillion of years of light
[56:09] space and on out into eternity into it
[56:14] Infinity into Infinity the infinite and
[56:18] great creature that was all and still is
[56:25] we are completely knocked out
[56:30] now this great being
[56:32] that we cannot fathom
[56:37] wanted to be revealed to his people
[56:40] the prophet of God said he wanted to
[56:43] express himself
[56:45] one of his great three-fold
[56:48] purposes was to express himself
[56:53] identify himself with human beings
[56:59] to identify himself with human being but
[57:03] how would you ident how would this
[57:06] infinite identify with my brother and my
[57:09] sister
[57:15] and secondly and to identify himself
[57:18] with human beings to reveal
[57:21] himself in Christ
[57:23] secondly to have preeminence in his body
[57:27] of Believers that is his bride that he
[57:30] my not only be identified with people he
[57:35] becomes even deeper
[57:38] to live in people oh how do you take
[57:43] this and bring it down there
[57:45] there's just no way
[57:47] how would you take this infinite being
[57:50] where are we going to put it how the
[57:53] only thing you can be swallowed into it
[57:55] but no he wants to come into you
[58:00] now this this will give you
[58:04] chills and humility to know that the god
[58:07] the infinite one
[58:10] is longing to be inside of you it should
[58:15] be that the most thing that would humble
[58:19] any mortal
[58:23] any motto
[58:25] God's holy spirit that is promised to
[58:27] come in indwell within you
[58:29] it should be the most reverent Reverend
[58:35] being ever in our lives
[58:38] because it's
[58:40] funneling
[58:41] this infinite into you
[58:48] something very interesting he keep kept
[58:51] on he said now he could do that in Adam
[58:54] and Eve
[58:56] but sin separated them I don't know how
[58:59] would his God as a man how would he even
[59:02] do that in Adam and Eve
[59:04] but sin separated them
[59:06] so now their head
[59:10] oh I love this
[59:12] their head to be some way to get it back
[59:18] again
[59:19] he's still determined
[59:21] not only to be identified with human
[59:24] beings
[59:25] but he is still determined to live
[59:28] inside them
[59:31] and there had to be some way to get it
[59:34] back in
[59:36] that's where Christ steps in
[59:40] anything he could do he had to use
[59:43] Christ Christ is the one it's the love
[59:46] of God to you
[59:52] see what God's purpose was
[59:56] now why didn't he just keep Adam and Eve
[59:59] like that
[1:00:00] then he would never be able to express
[1:00:02] his fullness
[1:00:05] that's where he the nominations might
[1:00:07] not are blown
[1:00:09] his full attribute because he could have
[1:00:12] been a father there that's true but also
[1:00:16] he's a savior you say how do you know he
[1:00:19] was
[1:00:20] he is because I've had an experience see
[1:00:24] he is a savior and he had to express
[1:00:27] that
[1:00:29] and how could he do it
[1:00:32] only through Christ
[1:00:35] it's the full Christ
[1:00:37] that he has been achieving anything that
[1:00:41] he ever is because Christ would take him
[1:00:45] from this mysterious being
[1:00:48] and bring it to us
[1:00:51] so when Christ will have a deeper
[1:00:53] meaning than it's just that
[1:00:57] just a ghost
[1:00:59] no
[1:01:00] it's God himself
[1:01:03] but in a way that he can relate to us in
[1:01:06] a way that he can come and live in Us in
[1:01:09] everything we have it's only through
[1:01:11] Christ
[1:01:12] because everything he had only through
[1:01:15] Christ
[1:01:20] and also he said
[1:01:23] in the Hebrews the book of Hebrews he
[1:01:25] said Christ revealed the god
[1:01:29] he said um he said it's no not me that
[1:01:32] do what the work it's my father that
[1:01:34] dwelleth in me I do nothing in myself
[1:01:37] but what I see the father doing the
[1:01:40] father in me showing me these visions
[1:01:42] and then I go do just what the father
[1:01:44] told me to do you get it God was inside
[1:01:48] inside of a human body
[1:01:52] not being not behind the goat's kids
[1:01:55] died
[1:01:57] but was living moving God had hands
[1:02:03] God had feet God had tongue God had eyes
[1:02:07] and it was Christ there he was
[1:02:13] so we're seeing that as we read the
[1:02:17] scripture in the Book of John this
[1:02:20] to fellow
[1:02:22] they could not understand or explain why
[1:02:25] they still stayed with John the Baptist
[1:02:27] after he pointed them to a man which was
[1:02:31] his second cousin and then he even told
[1:02:33] them that I knew him not twice in the
[1:02:36] same verse in the same chapter I knew
[1:02:39] him not
[1:02:40] someone says this some of his followers
[1:02:42] said you mean you don't know him
[1:02:45] I said I knew him not because he was
[1:02:48] speaking the spiritual level
[1:02:50] and they were in the flesh and said you
[1:02:52] should know him this is your second
[1:02:53] cousin but these two disciples they
[1:02:56] heard that they saw that but something
[1:02:58] inside of them waited for this day
[1:03:03] and the prophet of God said that
[1:03:06] in the God is rich in Mercy Jesus said
[1:03:10] there's no man who can come to me except
[1:03:12] my father draws him first these were
[1:03:15] drawn
[1:03:17] something that could not they could not
[1:03:19] control
[1:03:20] I can see their wives maybe their
[1:03:23] children said you are crazy how would
[1:03:26] you your fellow brother disciples
[1:03:28] co-disciples left what are you still
[1:03:30] hanging on to that person they could not
[1:03:32] explain it
[1:03:34] they had to be there
[1:03:38] and he said
[1:03:40] God has to do the drawing that has there
[1:03:44] has to be a life
[1:03:45] and all that he has given me will come
[1:03:49] to me he made a provision for those who
[1:03:52] want to be redeemed
[1:03:55] these two were to be redeemed even when
[1:03:59] John was decreasing so Christ could
[1:04:02] increase
[1:04:03] they were redeemed and because they were
[1:04:06] the redeemed in them there was a seed of
[1:04:09] redemption God made a provision for them
[1:04:15] I like how the prophet of God puts this
[1:04:17] in the in the adoption he said
[1:04:20] here is the way they tried to make it
[1:04:22] God said well there's a lot of people
[1:04:24] lost I want them to be saved so I will
[1:04:27] send Jesus down in perhaps maybe
[1:04:30] somebody will feel sorry
[1:04:34] some people think that by making a movie
[1:04:37] showing The Passion of Christ we have
[1:04:39] heard it or in in Years Gone by or you
[1:04:42] you tell the story the denomination can
[1:04:45] tell you the story of how cruel the
[1:04:47] death of Christ is and you can feel the
[1:04:50] pity you feel the sorrow but it's not by
[1:04:53] that you come to Christ
[1:04:56] it's not by that by the feeling the
[1:04:58] emotion how painful it has been on him
[1:05:01] to take my life it has nothing to do
[1:05:04] with it
[1:05:05] and the prophet of God clarifies that
[1:05:07] here
[1:05:08] and know that I've done so so I will
[1:05:12] send Jesus down in perhaps maybe
[1:05:14] somebody feels sorry and know that I've
[1:05:18] done and get saved all Mercy I wouldn't
[1:05:21] run my my office like that even as poor
[1:05:24] as I do run it sometimes
[1:05:26] I wouldn't do it like that
[1:05:28] God by his foreknowledge
[1:05:33] oh praise be to God wouldn't you say
[1:05:36] Amen would you see me scream about that
[1:05:39] God by his foreknowledge
[1:05:42] seen exactly who would be saved and who
[1:05:49] wouldn't be saved
[1:05:51] a security again
[1:05:55] it's a security it's not how much you
[1:05:59] they can tell you how how Jesus Christ
[1:06:02] just was so horribly beaten on the cross
[1:06:06] you might be standing there not feeling
[1:06:07] no emotions
[1:06:09] but deep inside there
[1:06:11] is a seed to be redeemed
[1:06:14] he's going to redeem you
[1:06:16] it's not based on emotions
[1:06:20] He sent Jesus to save those that he had
[1:06:25] already chosen
[1:06:28] oh brother
[1:06:30] my that puts me to rest brother
[1:06:33] that puts me to rest he said
[1:06:37] he chose us in him before there even was
[1:06:41] a world
[1:06:43] that's our inheritance
[1:06:46] God chose us and let Jesus come and pay
[1:06:49] the price
[1:06:51] he sh his shedding of the blood that no
[1:06:54] sin would be accounted to us nothing you
[1:06:58] do
[1:06:59] nothing
[1:07:00] he did it
[1:07:03] and he keeps on he said for he that sin
[1:07:06] willfully after receiving the knowledge
[1:07:08] the knowledge of the truth there's no
[1:07:11] more sacrifice and he clarified it he
[1:07:13] said who had received the knowledge of
[1:07:16] the truth they never received the truth
[1:07:20] because
[1:07:22] they just received the knowledge of it
[1:07:25] then you can be tempted even to sin
[1:07:27] willfully
[1:07:28] when you only have a knowledge of it
[1:07:31] see it's impossible for those who are
[1:07:34] once enlightened and made partakers of
[1:07:36] Holy Ghost tasted the power of God
[1:07:39] because they are the truth themselves
[1:07:45] so coming back to little
[1:07:48] our little reading here I don't know how
[1:07:51] the time goes on so I'm gonna stop
[1:07:53] somewhere but we're coming back to now
[1:07:56] the main the main our main subject now
[1:07:59] Christ Jesus is turning the man who's
[1:08:02] been pointed to them as the Lamb of God
[1:08:04] asking
[1:08:06] what do you seek what's seeketh thou
[1:08:09] they say where do I what do you dwell
[1:08:13] and we will read that in 40 now
[1:08:16] let's start at 39 he saith unto them
[1:08:20] come and see they came and saw where he
[1:08:24] dwelt if they only needed to see where
[1:08:26] he'd work that would satisfy them
[1:08:29] because they saw where he dwelt and
[1:08:32] Abode with him that day for it was about
[1:08:35] the tenth hour
[1:08:36] one of the two which heard John speaking
[1:08:39] follow him was Andrew
[1:08:42] followed him was Andrew
[1:08:44] Simon Peter's brother he first finds his
[1:08:47] brother Simon in saith unto him we have
[1:08:51] found where he dwelt
[1:08:53] did I read that correctly no
[1:08:59] he first finds his own brother Simon and
[1:09:03] said unto him we have found the Messiah
[1:09:08] which is being interpreted the Christ
[1:09:12] that was exactly
[1:09:15] the answer
[1:09:17] to their question to their seeking
[1:09:24] and by the word dwelleth in Greek
[1:09:28] it's a primary verb it tells us to abide
[1:09:31] to stay in a given place a given state
[1:09:36] also in the same Greek it means to stay
[1:09:40] in a relationship
[1:09:44] who stays in a relationship with you
[1:09:49] who are you related to that's their
[1:09:53] question
[1:09:54] who are you related to you are a man we
[1:09:59] know your second cousin to John John is
[1:10:02] pointing to you that you are the lamb
[1:10:06] Master could you clarify that
[1:10:10] who are you related to
[1:10:14] who is in a union with you
[1:10:18] who can testify of you
[1:10:23] the prophet of God said that in in God's
[1:10:26] only provided place of worship
[1:10:28] throw the edges many
[1:10:30] has sought to for this this secret place
[1:10:34] of God through all the ages even a job
[1:10:37] wanted to know where he lived
[1:10:41] job looked for that dwelling place too
[1:10:45] if I could only go to his house and
[1:10:48] knock at his door but the prophet of God
[1:10:50] slips in something very important he
[1:10:53] said job wanted to find God's Dwelling
[1:10:56] Place
[1:10:58] because
[1:11:01] there God and his family is worshiped
[1:11:05] together
[1:11:07] whoa
[1:11:09] their god with his family is worshiped
[1:11:12] together
[1:11:13] that's the only place
[1:11:16] that this great
[1:11:18] trillions Cycles a lifetime and his
[1:11:22] children can worship together and that's
[1:11:24] only in Christ
[1:11:26] their questions was they were seeking
[1:11:29] for Christ for seeking for somebody who
[1:11:32] can be the bridge between this great
[1:11:34] mysterious God and man
[1:11:40] worshiped together
[1:11:42] and Jesus told them come and see
[1:11:45] and the prophet of God said these are
[1:11:47] two when the veil was lifted
[1:11:51] after finding the place he was dwelling
[1:11:54] it wasn't too much they were poor the
[1:11:57] Bible 53 Isaiah 53 describes it it
[1:12:00] wasn't even too much to look at so that
[1:12:02] when they found the place it was
[1:12:04] dwelling he couldn't even pay attention
[1:12:06] to it but once they are bowed with him
[1:12:10] something came open to them
[1:12:13] something the answer to their question
[1:12:16] brother Brahm says that every answer
[1:12:19] needs and must have and every every
[1:12:22] question must have an answer
[1:12:25] and what is the answer the answer is
[1:12:29] Christ
[1:12:30] in anything you have a question
[1:12:33] you have a question we've got only one
[1:12:36] answer
[1:12:37] the answer is always Christ the word the
[1:12:41] word of your day is answer to everything
[1:12:45] you ever have a question on
[1:12:49] CE you have Christ
[1:12:51] you've got all the questions answered in
[1:12:53] your life
[1:12:54] you've got all the questions answered
[1:12:58] oh
[1:13:00] the veil the prophet of God says in the
[1:13:03] unveiling of God he said the veil has
[1:13:05] been lifted off the word
[1:13:08] for those two disciples that veil was
[1:13:12] lifted
[1:13:14] then the kid could see Christ
[1:13:17] that's right it's revealed to babes it's
[1:13:20] lifted they see it that's right then it
[1:13:24] will be as once when you see when this
[1:13:26] Veil is taken off of the word the
[1:13:29] Traditions is taken off of the word
[1:13:32] as Jesus once said when you see me you
[1:13:36] see the father see God in his word is
[1:13:39] one
[1:13:41] not understand that
[1:13:43] slips down he said if I do not the works
[1:13:46] of my father then don't believe me but
[1:13:49] if I do the works
[1:13:51] and I and my father are one and the
[1:13:54] prophet of God says when you see the
[1:13:57] word made manifest
[1:14:00] you have seen the father
[1:14:03] and the word manifestes Christ
[1:14:07] God because the word is the father
[1:14:10] the word is God and the word made
[1:14:13] manifest is God himself taking his own
[1:14:17] word in manifesting it among among
[1:14:21] believers
[1:14:23] now listen this is very critical
[1:14:26] everything is critical but listen to
[1:14:28] this
[1:14:30] he said nothing can make it live
[1:14:35] nothing can make the word of God live
[1:14:40] but believers
[1:14:42] just believers
[1:14:44] you're saying you say I'm a Believer
[1:14:47] but how can I
[1:14:49] how can the word of God can I make the
[1:14:51] word of God live in my life
[1:14:55] because it says nothing else can make it
[1:14:58] live
[1:14:59] but believers
[1:15:02] just believers
[1:15:07] now listen to what the prophet God says
[1:15:10] in
[1:15:12] calling Jesus on the scene 63.
[1:15:15] God created the winds you still have
[1:15:17] that question hanging in your mind right
[1:15:18] how can I make the word of God believe
[1:15:21] uh make it live I'm a Believer I've been
[1:15:25] believing this message
[1:15:26] I've been trying my best to do it how
[1:15:29] can I make it live
[1:15:31] the prophet of God will give us an
[1:15:33] answer
[1:15:34] he said God created the winds and the
[1:15:36] waves
[1:15:37] if other things had to obey him
[1:15:40] and he was the creator
[1:15:43] would not the winds and the waves have
[1:15:45] to obey him also
[1:15:49] notice let us remember he also created
[1:15:52] our bodies oh
[1:15:55] he's coming closer to us I answer our
[1:15:57] question he also created our bodies
[1:16:02] and want our bodies have to obey him
[1:16:07] meaning for the word his word can only
[1:16:11] be made life
[1:16:15] through Believers just believers
[1:16:19] and Believers have bodies
[1:16:21] we are bodies said and want our bodies
[1:16:25] have to obey him
[1:16:27] he's giving us the key now
[1:16:30] you surrender your thoughts to him
[1:16:36] want to make the word of God live
[1:16:39] make it live nothing else can make it
[1:16:42] live but Believers just believers
[1:16:45] and Believers have the desire for God to
[1:16:48] make his word live and he's giving us
[1:16:51] the way
[1:16:53] you surrender your thoughts to him
[1:16:57] Surrender Your Life to him those
[1:16:59] sleeping deacons would you help us maybe
[1:17:01] name all those that have been sleeping I
[1:17:04] see I'm gonna call you by name
[1:17:08] you surrender your thoughts to him
[1:17:11] Surrender Your Life to him
[1:17:14] Surrender Your Faith to him
[1:17:18] and watch that body
[1:17:21] obey what he says oh brother this is
[1:17:24] powerful because you're not going to
[1:17:27] strive anything you just give your
[1:17:31] thoughts to him just just do what the
[1:17:33] prophet has told you to do it's not
[1:17:36] you're not pushing or shoving or are we
[1:17:39] going to do this no surrender your
[1:17:42] thought to him
[1:17:44] Surrender Your Life to him
[1:17:47] Surrender Your Faith to him
[1:17:50] take your hands off
[1:17:52] and you'll watch him
[1:17:55] and you're watching
[1:17:58] just do those three and set quiet
[1:18:00] because of faith I looked up the word
[1:18:03] faith in in the Hebrews face
[1:18:07] means something that's permanent
[1:18:12] it's quiet
[1:18:14] can remember Moses in the before uh
[1:18:17] these magicians he put out his uh his
[1:18:21] Rod there turns into serpents they did
[1:18:24] this very same well Moses to do
[1:18:28] Faith had to keep him quiet
[1:18:33] faith is permanent
[1:18:38] and just give him those three your
[1:18:41] thought thoughts your life and your
[1:18:46] faith take your hands off new watch can
[1:18:50] fold your hands and watch him
[1:18:53] and watch that body obey what he says he
[1:18:57] will make that body come back in
[1:19:00] subjection to the word yes sir but
[1:19:03] you've got to surrender it to him you've
[1:19:06] got to believe him he made our bodies
[1:19:09] they obey him
[1:19:11] he they obey his will also
[1:19:14] do you believe that
[1:19:16] if you are a Christian you have to
[1:19:20] that's why the prophet is saying
[1:19:22] if you are a Christian you have it
[1:19:25] there's no other way around
[1:19:27] always been commissioned brother it's
[1:19:29] sorry that many things going through my
[1:19:32] mind here but you know he doesn't need
[1:19:34] your abilities
[1:19:36] no no he does not he does not need your
[1:19:40] abilities I'm going to tell you I'm
[1:19:41] gonna the prophet of God is going to
[1:19:43] tell us what our abilities could do in
[1:19:46] life
[1:19:49] it's the message and the perfect
[1:19:51] strength by Perfect weakness in 61.
[1:19:55] the prophet of God is telling us
[1:19:58] speaking about Moses he said Moses
[1:20:01] seeing the need of the Dead
[1:20:03] this was a need
[1:20:08] not something that Moses imagined
[1:20:11] the need was there and you will see that
[1:20:14] it was the will of God
[1:20:18] Moses seeing the need of the day
[1:20:21] with his intellectual powers
[1:20:25] and his ability that he had to do with
[1:20:28] he was a smart man excuse me he was the
[1:20:33] coming pharaoh
[1:20:34] he had psychology he had physical
[1:20:37] strength he had everything so he said
[1:20:41] I'm well equipped I know all of it
[1:20:45] and if there's a man in the land that
[1:20:47] that's able to do it I am
[1:20:50] Moses had those
[1:20:54] so I'm the man of the hour
[1:20:57] so I will step out
[1:20:59] and he went out to accomplish a work
[1:21:02] that was right
[1:21:07] this work was right
[1:21:10] there was a need for the day
[1:21:12] they were in slavery
[1:21:14] the word of God was to be fulfilled
[1:21:16] after 400 years plus that was to be
[1:21:20] fulfilling that and the need was there a
[1:21:23] real need from God
[1:21:26] the work was right
[1:21:28] and in the will of God
[1:21:41] he went out
[1:21:43] to accomplish a work that was right
[1:21:46] and in the will of God
[1:21:49] and he offered his natural abilities and
[1:21:53] listen what God did with his natural
[1:21:54] abilities
[1:21:56] the same way he did with his he will do
[1:21:58] with yours and mine
[1:22:02] and God refused it
[1:22:06] he couldn't use one thing that Moses had
[1:22:11] forgot
[1:22:15] so goodbye my ability
[1:22:18] he couldn't use one thing that Moses had
[1:22:25] he couldn't use it then
[1:22:28] neither can he use it now God cannot use
[1:22:32] our natural abilities
[1:22:36] for my natural abilities
[1:22:39] brother Gardner knows
[1:22:42] I have three
[1:22:44] degenerated discs
[1:22:46] I cannot stand for more than 30 minutes
[1:22:50] for if I counted my ability I could not
[1:22:53] be standing here
[1:22:57] and it's amazing that if I send more
[1:22:59] than 30 minutes because I'm checking
[1:23:01] that they can give me some injection in
[1:23:02] my back glad to see sister Bob how you
[1:23:05] doing sister Barb much better
[1:23:07] wonderful
[1:23:09] so it's when
[1:23:10] [Music]
[1:23:12] we're giving this body maybe the service
[1:23:15] preaching I can go for four hours I
[1:23:18] don't feel anything right now I'm
[1:23:19] feeling nothing
[1:23:22] if it was for my abilities I cannot
[1:23:24] stand here
[1:23:26] and he said he couldn't use it then
[1:23:29] neither can he use it now God cannot use
[1:23:31] our natural abilities we've got to get
[1:23:35] ourselves and our abilities out of the
[1:23:38] way
[1:23:41] and surrender to the will and the power
[1:23:43] of God
[1:23:46] now we're coming back to
[1:23:49] these two disciples we're back and forth
[1:23:52] they are finding the very thing they
[1:23:57] were seeking after
[1:23:59] that was
[1:24:00] who was that man related to
[1:24:03] there was something about him who was
[1:24:06] who was inside of him or which state was
[1:24:09] he in they couldn't get put it together
[1:24:12] but after they Abode with him
[1:24:14] they found out that he was the Messiah
[1:24:18] he was the Christ
[1:24:20] and then the prophet of God when what is
[1:24:22] the messiah
[1:24:23] what is Christ let's let's take the
[1:24:26] prophet's work
[1:24:28] in the possessing the enemies gave the
[1:24:30] prophet of God said now remember he was
[1:24:33] the son of God when he was born
[1:24:37] he was God's virgin born son
[1:24:41] but when he became Messiah
[1:24:46] Jesus was born a Son of God but he was
[1:24:50] not born the Messiah
[1:24:55] he had to become the Messiah
[1:24:59] because the indwelling the anointing of
[1:25:02] God Messiah means the anointed one he
[1:25:05] had to come upon him he had to come God
[1:25:08] provided himself a body
[1:25:10] on Earth but that deity had to come
[1:25:15] together and dwell in the fullness of it
[1:25:18] he become Messiah
[1:25:20] that's when the Holy Spirit Come on him
[1:25:23] cause the Messiah means of the anointed
[1:25:26] one
[1:25:28] see and he was the anointed one when the
[1:25:31] Holy Spirit came on him
[1:25:35] oh brother when the Holy Spirit comes on
[1:25:39] you
[1:25:40] brother
[1:25:41] it's
[1:25:43] Christ
[1:25:46] in Christ there's only two portions you
[1:25:49] can the anointed anointing alone is not
[1:25:51] Christ it has to be a counter body here
[1:25:54] there too
[1:25:56] you can look you see a man and someone
[1:25:58] look and see God
[1:26:03] he said remember my message on Messiahs
[1:26:07] you see you are the word Messiah means
[1:26:10] the anointed one
[1:26:14] the anointed one
[1:26:16] if now you are if you have the Holy
[1:26:20] Spirit
[1:26:21] that's the prophet saying it
[1:26:23] you'll become the anointed one
[1:26:26] what does it make you it's not you alone
[1:26:30] it's Christ in you that's the Messiah
[1:26:32] it's that combo
[1:26:36] of you and him being one that combo is
[1:26:39] Christ is the anointed one
[1:26:42] he said give me a church in the hood you
[1:26:44] say this is give me a church that's so
[1:26:47] completely Anointed with God till their
[1:26:50] every action and move is thus saith the
[1:26:53] Lord walk in that kind of Glory I will
[1:26:56] show you a messiah
[1:26:58] a church
[1:27:00] could be a messiah
[1:27:02] when she is
[1:27:04] one with the anointed with Christ
[1:27:09] feet so if he sent his son like that
[1:27:12] Jesus Christ in whom he the fullness
[1:27:15] dwell he's going to be sending us the
[1:27:17] same way
[1:27:18] John 17 18 to 22 in 2019 is thou has
[1:27:23] sent me into the world even so have I
[1:27:27] also sent them
[1:27:29] into the world and for their sakes I
[1:27:33] sanctify myself
[1:27:35] what they that they also might that they
[1:27:39] also might be Sanctified through the
[1:27:40] truth
[1:27:44] reading this in the book of Ephesians
[1:27:46] because the prophet of God said that we
[1:27:48] are Sanctified to be filled when God is
[1:27:51] Not sanctify us just to let us be in
[1:27:53] clean no
[1:27:55] we are being Sanctified for a purpose
[1:27:58] and that purpose is to be filled
[1:28:02] God sent his son the same way and his
[1:28:06] son Sanctified himself
[1:28:08] for the fullness of his father could
[1:28:10] dwell in him
[1:28:12] now Jesus is sending us the same way
[1:28:15] he Sanctified himself
[1:28:19] and now we're coming so we can be filled
[1:28:22] with his fullness
[1:28:24] Ephesians 3 14 through 19 said for this
[1:28:29] cause I bow my knees and to the father
[1:28:33] of our Lord Jesus of whom the whole
[1:28:35] family in Heaven and Earth is named that
[1:28:38] he would Grant you this is Paul telling
[1:28:42] he would Grant you
[1:28:43] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:28:47] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[1:28:49] in the Inner Man
[1:28:51] that Christ May dwell in your hearts by
[1:28:55] faith
[1:28:57] that ye being rooted and grounded in the
[1:29:01] in love may be able to comprehend with
[1:29:05] All Saints not him alone he wants All
[1:29:08] Saints in that body
[1:29:10] dwelling in Christ
[1:29:12] what is the bread
[1:29:14] the length the depth and height
[1:29:17] and to know the love of Christ the love
[1:29:21] of Christ is greater than we ever even
[1:29:23] thought
[1:29:24] and to know the love of Christ which
[1:29:27] passes the knowledge that ye might be
[1:29:31] filled with all the fullness of God God
[1:29:34] is not saying hey you just have a
[1:29:36] portion of me his desire is for you to
[1:29:40] be filled with everything he has ever
[1:29:42] been
[1:29:44] what love
[1:29:46] he's giving himself totally not a
[1:29:48] portion the fullness in this generation
[1:29:51] you can have that fullness of God
[1:29:53] dwelling within you
[1:29:56] is what time is a slipping way
[1:29:59] in the message Oneness the prophet of
[1:30:01] God said
[1:30:02] if he abide in me Jesus saying and my
[1:30:05] word in you you can ask what you will
[1:30:08] now listen to what God wants you to ask
[1:30:11] him
[1:30:13] what you will just thinking about little
[1:30:16] things God wants you to ask for the
[1:30:19] creative things
[1:30:21] he said if I abide in me if he abide in
[1:30:25] me my word in you what is it
[1:30:29] you've got to get with the word get
[1:30:32] yourself killed now
[1:30:34] I'm I'm persuaded that many of us
[1:30:37] friends have received the Holy Ghost but
[1:30:41] we just receive enough Holy Ghost enough
[1:30:45] said we just receive enough holy ghost
[1:30:48] in us to make us to a place where we
[1:30:51] don't want to lie we don't want to steal
[1:30:54] we don't want to do anything but God
[1:30:58] wants you not enough Holy Spirit brother
[1:31:01] we could have enough Holy Spirit you
[1:31:04] know what I go to work I come here
[1:31:06] Wednesday and Sunday I show up
[1:31:08] and I'm believer I give my tithe my
[1:31:11] family is in order I do everything I go
[1:31:14] I'm not watching TVs I don't have that
[1:31:16] I'm misbelieving we can only have enough
[1:31:19] Holy Spirit
[1:31:25] he wants he said but God wants to fill
[1:31:29] every fiber of his church
[1:31:33] praise God every fiber
[1:31:40] he wants to feel your thinking he wants
[1:31:43] to fill your mind he wants to fill every
[1:31:46] bit of you just make you completely
[1:31:50] totally dead to yourself or to your
[1:31:54] thinking just surrender in God's till
[1:31:56] his words just living right through you
[1:32:01] living right through you you don't know
[1:32:04] you don't know nothing else but God's
[1:32:07] word nothing else we want to know I know
[1:32:09] I have kids going to college sometimes
[1:32:11] they come into this is what college what
[1:32:13] college you know what is my mind saying
[1:32:15] that's a lie that's a lie that's a lie
[1:32:17] that's a lie oh how did it go did you
[1:32:19] did you succeed it worked okay take it
[1:32:21] but you know what God's word is all it's
[1:32:24] going to fade away
[1:32:25] it's a lie it's a lie
[1:32:28] just stay right with the his word it is
[1:32:31] life my words are life Jesus said
[1:32:36] winding down
[1:32:38] in Christ is the mystery of God again he
[1:32:40] said what was Jesus manifested for
[1:32:44] that's the same way he he he's called
[1:32:47] you to be manifested the same in the
[1:32:49] same fashion
[1:32:51] Jesus was manifested to show God
[1:32:57] you are manifested in this generation
[1:33:01] to show God
[1:33:05] he was God he had to be no man could die
[1:33:09] no Prophet could could die he was God he
[1:33:13] was the god of the prophets he was the
[1:33:15] prophets
[1:33:16] he was the Kings he was the history he
[1:33:20] was he that was to come he that was he
[1:33:23] that is and he that's to be in this day
[1:33:26] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:33:29] he was manifested for that purpose now
[1:33:32] I'm coming to your portion down I was
[1:33:34] talking about his son
[1:33:38] and through that purpose he achieved a
[1:33:41] church
[1:33:43] brother
[1:33:44] we have been achieved
[1:33:47] we are God's achievement
[1:33:51] [Music]
[1:33:52] brother
[1:33:53] we are God's achievement
[1:34:04] and through that purpose he achieved the
[1:34:06] church
[1:34:07] that he God the fullness of God might
[1:34:12] bring to pass every promised word of God
[1:34:15] in these last days these last days every
[1:34:19] promise he has ever given
[1:34:22] there's an achievement on Earth
[1:34:25] to fulfill every one of them you know he
[1:34:28] wouldn't do any better if you tell
[1:34:29] somebody that I am I am the bride of
[1:34:31] Christ
[1:34:32] there's no there's no effect to that
[1:34:36] the effect will be when they look into
[1:34:38] the Bible where it's talking about the
[1:34:41] church and they see a person standing
[1:34:43] the characteristics are the same
[1:34:48] John the Baptist could not tell him he
[1:34:50] would not help them or I'm a Christ I'm
[1:34:52] a prophet I'm a liar
[1:34:54] no I am that word there that voice you
[1:34:58] see there I am that voice I'm one with
[1:35:01] it
[1:35:03] said
[1:35:05] that he might bring to pass every
[1:35:07] promised word of God in this last day
[1:35:10] when he gets preeminence in the church
[1:35:12] the position his place in the church
[1:35:16] his place in the church what is his
[1:35:18] place in the church and who is he the
[1:35:22] fullness
[1:35:25] the fullness
[1:35:27] it won't be robbery when the church
[1:35:29] claims the fullness Jesus claims the
[1:35:31] fullness no there's no robbery of God
[1:35:33] there it's exactly the same thing
[1:35:37] he gets preeminist his position Jesus
[1:35:40] said he that believe on me the works
[1:35:42] that I do shall he also even more than
[1:35:45] this shall he do
[1:35:47] he wants to get today and now today he
[1:35:51] wants to get somebody
[1:35:54] that can so see it
[1:35:57] that they can let the word he said Jesus
[1:36:02] so it's so
[1:36:04] so seen it so was so perfectly born for
[1:36:08] the day until God's expressed every move
[1:36:11] that he made
[1:36:14] and God wants this church
[1:36:17] so filled with him
[1:36:19] that every move that this church makes
[1:36:22] it expressing him
[1:36:25] let us stand
[1:36:27] I had to cut it short
[1:36:31] in First Corinthians 3 16 17 is Paul
[1:36:36] said
[1:36:36] know ye not that ye are the temple of
[1:36:39] God
[1:36:41] in that the spirit of God dwelleth in
[1:36:43] you
[1:36:47] the prophet of God said in the stature
[1:36:50] of a perfect man
[1:36:51] now building a house you put your
[1:36:53] uprights and everything else brother
[1:36:55] woods and some of these carpenters and
[1:36:58] contractors
[1:36:59] they could tell you how to build your
[1:37:01] house see but I'm going to tell you how
[1:37:04] to build your spiritual house
[1:37:07] where God can dwell
[1:37:10] he wants to dwell in you
[1:37:13] he wants to make you like himself
[1:37:19] like himself
[1:37:20] he wants you to be reflecting his being
[1:37:34] I like this prayer that we can close as
[1:37:36] the musicians would come
[1:37:39] Short Line that the prophet of God
[1:37:42] in the message a way to have Fellowship
[1:37:45] he's praying Softly
[1:37:49] saying Heavenly Father
[1:37:52] bless Thy word tonight
[1:37:55] and may to go out to every heart
[1:37:58] and find a Dwelling Place
[1:38:01] and never live no more
[1:38:08] his magician will sit play something
[1:38:10] Softly
[1:38:12] just by our heads the prayer his brother
[1:38:14] Chad can get ready to come
[1:38:18] precious Lord
[1:38:22] words a man can never utter
[1:38:27] what the heart has received

[1:38:33] Lord sometimes
[1:38:38] we go
[1:38:40] Sleepless in the nights and
[1:38:44] just to even fathom
[1:38:48] who you are and what you are to us
[1:38:53] many have come into this world
[1:38:59] with same two ears like I have two ears
[1:39:03] attached to my head
[1:39:04] [Music]
[1:39:07] Little Tall eyes like you have given me
[1:39:09] two little eyes to see

[1:39:42] come even closer to the surface of what
[1:39:45] you are to our lives

[1:45:17] been encouraged to press forward amen
[1:45:20] and go deeper amen and open myself more
[1:45:23] and surrender more you feel the same
[1:45:25] encouragement
[1:45:26] I don't I don't want to be found with
[1:45:29] just enough Holy Ghost to be a believer
[1:45:32] to be ranked in The Fellowship of
[1:45:34] Believers but I want to be filled with
[1:45:37] the fullness of God
[1:45:38] if there's more to be had I want to
[1:45:41] receive it amen amen and how how do we
[1:45:44] get filled up we have less of ourselves
[1:45:46] Paul says I Die daily
[1:45:50] laid our life on the Altar and we
[1:45:52] thought that we died and we gave all and
[1:45:53] we did amen we did it was genuine it was
[1:45:56] heartfelt but the more the word unfolds
[1:45:59] the more we realize there's still a
[1:46:00] piece of self there
[1:46:02] and then we surrender to that and died
[1:46:04] of that and then as the word unfolds
[1:46:05] more we find other little pieces of self
[1:46:07] and I say God thank you for revealing
[1:46:10] all those little pieces of self so that
[1:46:12] I can die to that and surrender that to
[1:46:14] you and let the word take over and be
[1:46:16] filled with all the fullness of God
[1:46:18] that's what I want I want the indwelling
[1:46:21] of Christ not just enough
[1:46:24] I want all that he is allowed for this
[1:46:26] age which is fullness I want to open
[1:46:28] myself for all all that I can receive
[1:46:31] and I want to empty out of every
[1:46:33] hindrance that would hinder God
[1:46:36] I know you feel the same way I'm so
[1:46:39] thankful for God bringing a word like
[1:46:40] this to keep reminding us and keep
[1:46:42] showing us hey this is the day this is
[1:46:45] the hour don't stop now we're not
[1:46:47] finished amen there's more to be had we
[1:46:49] can still grow
[1:46:51] and what God has given us
[1:46:53] I'm so excited so excited that the full
[1:46:56] potential has come to bring us into our
[1:46:58] full potential and I don't believe we've
[1:47:00] arrived yet
[1:47:02] but I'm pressing towards that amen amen
[1:47:05] I thank God thank you brother Emmanuel
[1:47:07] for surrendering to the Lord let's just
[1:47:10] bow our heads and thank God for this
[1:47:12] morning's service the heavenly father we
[1:47:14] thank you Lord
[1:47:16] for doing what you promised to do
[1:47:19] that if we would come and assemble
[1:47:20] ourselves together
[1:47:22] Lord the gift that you placed in a man
[1:47:25] and that man would surrender himself to
[1:47:26] you you've promised that by the
[1:47:29] foolishness of preaching you would save
[1:47:30] those that are lost
[1:47:33] Lord you would correct us you would
[1:47:35] encourage Us by your word that you would
[1:47:37] give us instruction and righteousness
[1:47:39] and Lord you have done all of that this
[1:47:42] morning God I'm so thankful that I can
[1:47:44] say you've been faithful to your word
[1:47:46] and God my greatest desire is to be
[1:47:49] found faithful that I can be faithful by
[1:47:52] my own choosing Lord that I can
[1:47:54] surrender you've already made your
[1:47:55] choice Lord and you chose me and I
[1:47:58] believe that by faith now I want to make
[1:48:00] you my choice
[1:48:01] and I want to choose you Lord and I want

[1:48:13] may you dwell in Us in fullness God may
[1:48:17] you accomplish your great purpose in
[1:48:19] this time to have absolute preeminence
[1:48:22] in a body of Believers and may we be
[1:48:24] part of that body of Believers and may
[1:48:27] you find your way day by day in a
[1:48:30] greater preeminence under our surrender

[1:48:35] each one of us Lord God that's what
[1:48:37] we're striving for help us Lord we thank

[1:48:48] morning may you replenish all that he's
[1:48:50] given out restore unto him Lord and I
[1:48:54] pray God that as he has confessed in
[1:48:56] this Pulpit that he has a problem with
[1:48:57] his back I pray he would heal his back
[1:48:59] Lord that you would deliver him from
[1:49:01] back pain not just while he's preaching
[1:49:03] the word if it can go away while
[1:49:05] preaching it can go away permanently

[1:49:09] brother and deliver him from whatever
