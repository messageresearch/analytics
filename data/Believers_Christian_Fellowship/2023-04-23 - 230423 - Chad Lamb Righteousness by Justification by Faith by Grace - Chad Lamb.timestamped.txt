[14:20] together
[14:22] dear Lord Jesus we thank you so much for
[14:25] this tremendous Revelation you've given
[14:27] us in this day
[14:29] God you've taken the veil off Lord so
[14:31] that we can see what your great plan has
[14:34] been
[14:35] and God we find ourselves by Grace a
[14:37] part of that plan
[14:40] God there's a gratitude that Wills up in
[14:42] US Lord that we can hardly contain we

[14:51] to give us the eyes have to see Lord we
[14:53] know it's by grace
[14:55] God I pray that this morning that you
[14:57] would come and take your place at the
[14:59] head of the table
[15:01] that you by your own hands would break
[15:03] the Word of Life Lord and feed it to
[15:05] each one of us
[15:06] I Surrender myself to you Lord help me

[15:11] control of this vessel may you Minister

[15:26] we pray
[15:27] Jesus Christ's name we pray
[15:30] amen
[15:31] and God bless you I mean while we're
[15:34] standing let's turn to the Book of
[15:35] Matthew together
[15:39] just uh we we got word this week and we
[15:43] send it out to you that they found the
[15:44] body of sister Donna Howard's father
[15:46] who'd been missing for about four months
[15:49] and and uh you know we thankful that
[15:52] they have closure and that they know
[15:53] what happened but it's a fresh
[15:55] disappointment it's fresh pain for her
[15:57] and the family so just remember her in
[16:00] prayer they still haven't got details
[16:02] together for the funeral yet it looks
[16:03] like it'll be down in the Dayton area so
[16:06] when that comes out we'll send it to
[16:07] everybody but remember sister Donna in
[16:10] prayer as this has been a really really
[16:12] difficult trial really long trial and
[16:15] now it's like fresh all over again so
[16:17] just remember her in prayer and also
[16:20] remember brother Daniel and sister
[16:21] Caitlyn and their family and all those
[16:23] that are helping they've got a wedding
[16:24] coming on Saturday and this is a busy
[16:26] week so be remember them in prayer we're
[16:29] looking forward to Saturday and seeing
[16:31] what God has done amen let's look at
[16:34] Matthew Chapter 5 together and let's
[16:36] let's go to verse 17 Matthew chapter 5.
[16:41] verse 17.
[16:46] she said think not that I'm come to
[16:48] destroy the law or the prophets I have
[16:50] not come to destroy but to fulfill
[16:53] preferably I say unto you till Heaven
[16:55] and Earth pass one jot or one Tittle
[16:57] shall and no wise pass from the law to
[16:59] all be fulfilled
[17:00] whosoever therefore shall break one of
[17:02] these least Commandments and shall teach
[17:04] men so he shall be called the least in
[17:06] the Kingdom of Heaven but whosoever
[17:08] shall do and teach them the same Shall
[17:10] be Called great in the Kingdom of Heaven
[17:13] for I say unto you that accept your
[17:15] righteousness shall exceed the
[17:16] righteousness of the scribes and
[17:18] Pharisees you shall in no wise enter
[17:20] into the kingdom of heaven
[17:23] as you have heard that it was said by
[17:25] them of old time you shall not kill
[17:27] whosoever shall kill shall be in danger
[17:29] of the Judgment but I say unto you that
[17:32] whosoever is angry with his brother
[17:33] without a cause shall be in danger of
[17:35] the judgment and whosoever shall say to
[17:38] his brother raqqa shall be in danger of
[17:40] counsel and whoever shall say thou full
[17:42] shall be in danger of Hell Fire Let's
[17:45] skip over to verse 27 now
[17:48] ye have heard that it was said by them
[17:50] of old time that thou shall not commit
[17:52] adultery but I say unto you that
[17:54] whosoever looketh on a woman to lust
[17:56] after her hath committed adultery with
[17:58] her already in his heart man God bless
[18:01] you as you're seated
[18:03] we'll look into this scripture
[18:05] amen you can go ahead and pull up the
[18:08] slideshow brother Franco Jesus is saying
[18:11] that he didn't come to destroy the law
[18:13] but to fulfill it and then he makes a
[18:16] statement that is really interesting he
[18:19] says in verse 20 he said accept your
[18:22] righteousness shall exceed the
[18:23] righteousness of the scribes and
[18:25] Pharisees you shall no wise enter in the
[18:27] kingdom of heaven and so now you can
[18:29] imagine being the people standing there
[18:31] that day when the scribes and the
[18:33] Pharisees were the were the religious
[18:35] The Devout of the day the Pharisees were
[18:38] the very strict devout of the day you
[18:40] could say like the legalist of the day
[18:42] and they had everything in order they
[18:43] had broadened their phylacteries they
[18:45] had the word abound on their wrist and
[18:47] bound on their forehead they had even
[18:49] come up with extra rituals and extra
[18:51] Traditions to be extra religious and
[18:53] extra right
[18:55] to be extra righteous and now Jesus is
[18:58] looking at them and says accept your
[19:01] righteousness exceed their righteousness
[19:03] you can't enter in to Heaven can you
[19:05] imagine how defeating that would be if
[19:07] you were the common person not religious
[19:09] and and not not not a Pharisee and maybe
[19:13] had some problems maybe had some
[19:15] troubles and kept tripping over your own
[19:16] feet then Jesus says accept your
[19:19] righteousness exceed their righteousness
[19:20] amen you can't enter into the Kingdom of
[19:23] Heaven amen you would feel totally
[19:25] defeated because how could you outwork
[19:27] the Pharisees
[19:28] but Jesus was referring to a different
[19:31] kind of righteousness not that kind of
[19:33] righteousness not a trying harder
[19:35] working harder doing more adding more
[19:37] rituals showing more devotion it wasn't
[19:39] that kind of righteousness there's a
[19:41] righteousness that can exceed the
[19:43] righteousness of the Pharisees and the
[19:45] scribes
[19:46] and then he goes on to talk about points
[19:48] of the law he said of old time it had
[19:50] been said that it's wrong to kill your
[19:53] brother but he says then if you're angry
[19:55] with your brother without a cause you're
[19:57] guilty of murder now Jesus went and took
[20:00] beyond the law amen Beyond keeping an
[20:02] ordinance and keeping obedience to a set
[20:04] of rules now he brought it right down
[20:06] into the heart that now if your heart is
[20:08] even wrong towards your brother you're
[20:10] still wrong
[20:13] then he says of old if if thou uh says
[20:17] of old if if you commit adultery amen
[20:20] you're guilty he says but if you even
[20:22] now I say unto you if you look after a
[20:24] woman to lust after her you've committed
[20:26] adultery already with her in your heart
[20:27] and now Jesus just made what was
[20:30] difficult harder
[20:33] because then your your righteousness has
[20:35] to exceed that and you thought you
[20:37] weren't allowed to kill you're not even
[20:38] allowed to be angry without a cause and
[20:40] you you weren't allowed to commit
[20:42] adultery and you may have had enough
[20:43] willpower to hold yourself back but what
[20:45] about your passions and lust and the
[20:47] secret going on in your heart what about
[20:49] that and now all of a sudden everything
[20:51] got harder
[20:54] praise God
[20:55] and I think that's a good thing
[20:59] um so today I want to I want to teach on
[21:02] this righteousness by justification by
[21:05] faith by grace
[21:06] so it's kind of an odd name but it
[21:08] speaks for itself righteousness by
[21:11] justification by faith by grace
[21:14] so the root of it all is Grace
[21:18] by Grace we can believe if we believe we
[21:20] can be justified if we're Justified
[21:21] we're declared righteous
[21:24] it's pretty simple
[21:26] amen it's amazing what the message has
[21:28] done to take the most fundamental
[21:31] doctrines of Christianity the basics of
[21:33] the basics and just they just explode
[21:35] amen they just open up on whole new
[21:37] levels and and I want to go into this
[21:39] it's been on my heart amen the Lord's
[21:41] been dealing with me in this direction
[21:42] for a little while and I just want to
[21:44] teach on it so I pray that you stay
[21:45] engaged today just because we're
[21:47] teaching doesn't mean you can go to
[21:48] sleep
[21:50] and and you know we always have to
[21:52] rehearse these things they go deeper and
[21:53] deeper but also we have new Believers we
[21:55] have young people coming up and growing
[21:57] and and they must be able to handle the
[22:00] word and understand where they stand in
[22:01] the word amen so we we have to
[22:03] constantly go over these but you know we
[22:05] talked over before it's like an ego when
[22:07] an eagle flies higher amen an eagle will
[22:10] Circle to catch the updraft
[22:12] so he keeps circling in the same general
[22:14] area but every time he circles he goes a
[22:16] little higher
[22:17] and a little higher we may Circle back
[22:19] over maybe some things we've understood
[22:21] or taught before it may be in a way
[22:23] review but each review with the open
[22:25] book takes us higher
[22:28] amen
[22:29] so righteousness by justification by
[22:31] faith by grace praise God
[22:34] I couldn't think of any other title
[22:36] anything better
[22:37] let's go to Romans 3 together and let's
[22:39] read this together Romans chapter 3
[22:41] verse 19.
[22:49] Romans chapter 3
[22:52] verse 19.
[22:54] now this could be an absolutely daunting
[22:57] subject huge we could go into it again
[22:59] and again and again uh for a series but
[23:01] I don't want to do that I just want to
[23:03] hit on it so I've I've pulled together
[23:04] some of the scriptures and quotes that
[23:06] came to mind under the inspiration and
[23:08] and there's so many more but we're just
[23:10] going to hit these and keep moving and
[23:13] try to paint the picture Romans chapter
[23:15] 3 verse 19.
[23:18] now we know that what thinks whoever the
[23:20] law saith it say to them who are under
[23:22] the law that every mouth may be stopped
[23:25] and all the world may become guilty
[23:26] before God
[23:27] so now there's a purpose to the law
[23:30] the law was to stop every mouth and to
[23:33] make everybody guilty
[23:35] the law was not to make everyone
[23:37] righteous the law was to make everyone
[23:39] guilty
[23:41] because everybody had to know they were
[23:43] guilty amen so that they would they
[23:46] would be primed to receive Grace
[23:49] so now that was the purpose of the law
[23:52] that every mouth may be stopped and all
[23:54] the world may become guilty before God
[23:58] therefore by the Deeds of the law there
[24:01] shall no flesh be justified in his sight
[24:03] for by the law is the knowledge of sin
[24:07] but now the righteousness of God without
[24:09] the law is manifested being witnessed by
[24:12] the law and the prophets even the
[24:14] righteousness of God which is by faith
[24:17] of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all
[24:20] them that believe for there is no
[24:23] difference
[24:24] for all have sinned and come short of
[24:25] the glory of God being justified freely
[24:28] by his grace through the Redemption that
[24:31] is in Christ Jesus whom God has set
[24:34] forth to be a propitiation through faith
[24:36] in his blood to declare his
[24:38] righteousness for the remission of sins
[24:40] that are passed through the forbearance
[24:42] of God to declare I say at this time his
[24:45] righteousness that he might be just and
[24:48] the justifier of him which believeth in
[24:50] Jesus where is boasting then it is
[24:54] excluded
[24:55] by what law by work nay but by the law
[24:58] of Faith therefore we conclude that a
[25:01] man is justified by faith without the
[25:04] Deeds of the law
[25:06] now when when Paul is preaching this my
[25:09] I mean he's preaching this and he's
[25:12] going into synagogues and he's going to
[25:13] city city city by City And even though
[25:16] he's going into the land of the Gentiles
[25:18] he's starting his ministry always in
[25:19] synagogues amen so he's dealing with the
[25:22] Jews and then from the Jews to the
[25:23] Gentiles and you can imagine being a Jew
[25:26] in that day and you've been taught the
[25:28] law the law the law of the law of the
[25:29] law all your life Moses law and now
[25:32] there here comes here comes a Jew coming
[25:34] along teaching that you can never be
[25:37] justified by the law that the law was
[25:39] not meant for your justification it was
[25:41] meant for your condemnation
[25:44] it was meant so you would understand sin
[25:47] that every mouth would be shut and
[25:48] everybody would become guilty that's why
[25:50] the law was here amen but now by the
[25:53] grace of God he has sent a propitiation
[25:56] or somebody to pay the price to cover
[25:58] you and to give than shed their own
[26:00] blood to pay for all the sins that were
[26:02] committed in violation to the law so
[26:05] that by faith in that amen he by his
[26:08] grace can declare you righteous
[26:12] not because you are righteous
[26:14] because he declares you not your rights
[26:16] you're righteous by faith not righteous
[26:18] by Deeds
[26:20] praise God
[26:22] so we want to keep going oh my goodness
[26:25] there's so many things I'd love to go
[26:26] line by line because it's so amazing
[26:30] that this is expressing the
[26:32] righteousness of God
[26:34] that God is always righteous he's always
[26:36] upright he's always correct he's always
[26:38] proper amen he's never unrighteous he's
[26:40] always righteous amen and God has done
[26:43] it this way so that he might be just and
[26:45] the justifier
[26:47] so just means that he's perfectly right
[26:50] there's nothing wrong there's no fault
[26:52] in what God is doing so he is just and
[26:54] he is also a justifier
[26:57] so if he is just Amen to justify means
[27:02] to bring you in the same condition he's
[27:03] in because he's just
[27:05] and if he justifies you he declares you
[27:08] just
[27:09] just as if you never did it clean and
[27:12] upright incorrect
[27:15] amen
[27:18] so I'm going to look at this in verse 26
[27:20] again to declare I say at this time his
[27:23] righteousness that he might be just and
[27:26] the justifier of him which believe in
[27:28] Jesus
[27:29] so that he would remain righteous so
[27:31] that he would remain his righteousness
[27:33] would be intact and he would remain just
[27:35] amen he couldn't just violate his own
[27:38] law so what he did is he came himself
[27:40] and he paid the price for his own law he
[27:43] suffered the consequences of his own law
[27:45] so that he could be just and the
[27:47] justifier of them that believe in Jesus
[27:50] praise God
[27:52] I want to look at these words
[27:53] righteousness
[27:55] the word righteousness and justifier
[27:57] justification they're very similar words
[27:59] they're one right after the other in in
[28:02] the concordance amen and they have very
[28:04] similar meanings righteousness is the
[28:07] state of him who is as he ought to be
[28:10] righteousness to condition accepted to
[28:13] God
[28:14] this is the state of him who is he ought
[28:16] to be righteous you're in the right
[28:19] standing you're upright you're as you
[28:21] ought to be you're accepted by God Amen
[28:24] let's look at this word justification if
[28:27] you look at the number here in
[28:28] righteousness this is 1343 that's the
[28:30] reference number in the concordance the
[28:32] very next word is 1344 and it's a word
[28:35] that's similar Amen in its justification
[28:38] and it's translated justify be freed be
[28:40] righteous justifier to render righteous
[28:44] are such he ought to be
[28:46] to render righteous
[28:49] not
[28:50] listen
[28:51] to render righteous means he makes you
[28:54] righteous
[28:57] or as such he ought to be
[29:00] to show exhibit events one to be
[29:03] righteous such as he is and wishes
[29:06] himself to be considered to declare
[29:08] pronounce one to be just righteous or
[29:12] such as he ought to be
[29:14] praise be to God I am so thankful that
[29:18] he is both just and a justifier that he
[29:21] can pronounce me to be righteous amen
[29:25] not because I'm righteous by what I've
[29:27] done with my deeds and my conduct amen
[29:30] but because he has Justified me and
[29:33] declared me to be righteous
[29:37] this is the foundation fundamental
[29:40] teaching of Christianity
[29:43] this is what separated law and Graces
[29:45] what separated the Jewish religion from
[29:47] Christianity
[29:49] so I love this to render righteous
[29:52] so to justify is to render you righteous
[29:55] or to declare you or to pronounce you
[29:58] to be righteous
[30:00] can you imagine standing in court in all
[30:02] the world against you and all the
[30:04] evidence and all these things and and
[30:06] you're standing there and the judge
[30:08] pronounces you just and righteous and
[30:11] you get to go free
[30:13] praise God we were in that position amen
[30:17] we were in that position we were born in
[30:19] sin amen shaping to iniquity coming to
[30:21] the world speaking lies born and under
[30:22] hybridization amen born a sinner born
[30:25] with enmity against God we come to the
[30:28] world this way amen but by the price of
[30:30] propitiation amen there's a price paid
[30:33] that can erase all of that and declare
[30:35] us just amen but we have to come God's
[30:38] provided way to this justifying
[30:40] pronouncement Amen to pronounce
[30:42] righteous and the only way we can get
[30:43] there is by faith
[30:45] praise God we'll get to that in just a
[30:48] minute
[30:49] second Corinthians chapter 3
[30:51] it says who also hath made us able
[30:54] Ministers of the New Testament not of
[30:57] the letter but of the spirit for the
[30:59] letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[31:00] life the letter intended to kill
[31:03] that was the job that was the goal but
[31:05] the spirit giveth life
[31:07] but if the administration of death
[31:09] written in engraven in Stones was
[31:10] glorious so that the children of Israel
[31:12] could not steadfastly behold the face of
[31:14] Moses for the glory of his countenance
[31:16] which Glory was to be done away Moses
[31:19] was so when he went and got the law and
[31:22] he came out to give the law amen there
[31:24] was such a glory in the giving of the
[31:26] word of God the law of God that Moses
[31:28] face shown that he had to cover it
[31:30] that's how glorious the law of the
[31:32] giving of the law was
[31:34] but that was the glory amen that that
[31:37] the law shall some point be done away
[31:41] which Glory was to be done away how
[31:44] shall not the ministration of the spirit
[31:46] be rather glorious so if that was
[31:48] glorious this should be more glorious
[31:51] Earth administration of condemnation be
[31:53] glory much more that the administration
[31:55] of righteousness exceed in glory for
[31:58] even that which was made glorious had no
[32:00] glory in this Respect by reason of the
[32:03] glory that excelleth for that which is
[32:05] done away was glorious much more that
[32:08] which remaineth is glorious
[32:10] if the law was glorious if the receiving
[32:12] of The Commandments of God of the whole
[32:14] Showdown on Mount Sinai if all of that
[32:17] was glorious this is more glorious
[32:19] it excellent in glory but there's two
[32:22] phrases here that I want to highlight
[32:24] the administration of condemnation this
[32:27] word Administration means Ministry the
[32:28] ministry of condemnation and the
[32:31] ministry of righteousness
[32:33] one was a Ministry of condemnation
[32:36] before this he calls it the ministry of
[32:38] death
[32:39] the ministry of death and the ministry
[32:41] of condemnation amen was it the word of
[32:44] God yes was it glorious yes is it
[32:46] perfect yes is it beautiful yes amen but
[32:49] we in our fallen condition can't keep it
[32:52] it's glorious it's perfect it's
[32:54] magnificent it's glory amen but we're
[32:57] unable amen and that's the purpose of
[33:00] the law to show us our condition that we
[33:02] are unable and we need a justifier
[33:06] so the there's a Ministry of
[33:08] condemnation but now this is the
[33:10] ministry of righteousness
[33:13] now I I want to look at it as the
[33:15] ministry of righteousness meaning
[33:17] righteousness is being ministered
[33:21] the ministry of condemnation by the very
[33:25] fact that the word was ministered it
[33:28] condemned
[33:31] so the ministry of the law brought
[33:34] condemnation and guilt into the human
[33:36] race
[33:39] but this is a Ministry of righteousness
[33:41] that will bring righteousness to the
[33:44] human race
[33:45] minister to them not not earned by
[33:49] effort indeed but Ministry of
[33:51] righteousness
[33:53] amen praise God
[33:55] all right Philippians chapter 3 but what
[33:57] things were gained to me those I counted
[33:59] lost for Christ ye doubtless and count
[34:02] all things but lost for the Excellency
[34:04] of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord
[34:06] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[34:08] things and do count them but done that I
[34:10] may win Christ and be found in him not
[34:13] having mine own righteousness which is
[34:16] of the law but that which is through the
[34:17] Faith of Christ the righteousness which
[34:20] is of god by faith so I don't want my
[34:23] own righteousness because the law came
[34:25] to show me that I have none
[34:27] but I want the righteousness that is of
[34:30] God by faith amen that's the one that I
[34:32] want and it's through faith in Christ
[34:35] and so I just want to look at this uh
[34:38] for a minute I put these on the overhead
[34:39] because I want to go fast through the
[34:40] scriptures instead of us slipping but
[34:42] you can jot them down there's quite a
[34:43] number of them if we go back to Isaiah
[34:46] 64 6 it says but we are all as an
[34:49] unclean thing
[34:51] that word all do we have to put up the
[34:54] definition of that or do we understand
[34:55] all
[34:56] do we have to go to the concordance or
[34:58] do we really understand all we are all
[35:01] as an unclean thing in all our
[35:03] righteousness are as filthy rats
[35:06] the very best that we've done is filth
[35:11] all our righteousness
[35:14] it says filthy rags and we all do fate
[35:16] as a leaf and our iniquities like the
[35:19] wind have taken us away
[35:21] in the Psalms David says the Lord looked
[35:24] down from heaven upon the children of
[35:26] men to see if there were any that did
[35:28] understand and seek God
[35:30] they are all gone aside they are all
[35:34] together become filthy there is none
[35:36] that doeth good no not one
[35:43] Psalms 143 1.
[35:46] David says hear my prayers O Lord give
[35:48] ear to my supplications and thy
[35:51] faithfulness answer me in thy
[35:53] righteousness he's not asking about his
[35:55] rights this is he said in thy
[35:57] faithfulness answer me and in thy
[35:58] righteousness
[36:00] and enter not into judgment with thy
[36:02] servant for in thy sight shall no man
[36:06] living be justified
[36:10] David is saying Lord
[36:13] in your faithfulness and in your
[36:14] righteousness deal with me not in mine
[36:17] that's what David's saying Lord I'm
[36:20] imploring your righteousness I'm
[36:21] imploring your faithfulness don't enter
[36:24] into judgment with me
[36:26] for for in thy sight shall no man living
[36:30] be justified
[36:34] can't happen
[36:36] this is the death to legalism
[36:39] there's no way that legalism will ever
[36:43] work it didn't work for the Jews it
[36:45] won't work for Christians
[36:47] it just won't work it can't work we've
[36:51] sometimes tried to make it work and all
[36:52] of us in different ways have taken ideas
[36:55] and it just doesn't work
[36:57] we'll get into why
[36:59] Romans chapter 1 says for I'm not
[37:01] ashamed of the gospel of Christ
[37:03] for it is the power of God unto
[37:05] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[37:07] the Jew first and also to the creek
[37:09] Greek for therein is the righteousness
[37:11] of God revealed from Faith to Faith that
[37:13] is as it is written the just shall live
[37:16] by faith
[37:20] and he says in Galatians 3 wherefore the
[37:23] law was our school master
[37:25] to bring us unto Christ that we might be
[37:28] justified by faith
[37:30] the law was never intended to justify us
[37:32] the law was to teach us
[37:35] to teach us about how far away we were
[37:37] about how impossible it was how
[37:40] reformation and legalism and rules were
[37:42] never going to bring us into a Justified
[37:44] state but that we could be justified by
[37:46] faith it was the teacher to bring us to
[37:49] justification by faith
[37:51] we had to try and fail and try and fail
[37:54] and try and fail and try and fail until
[37:55] God would open a door to another way
[37:59] amen because we tried and failed and
[38:02] tried and failed and tried and failed
[38:03] and that happened all through the the
[38:05] history of the Jews tried and failed and
[38:07] tried and failed but in our history too
[38:09] we've tried and failed and tried and
[38:11] failed
[38:12] but I thank God there's one who tried
[38:14] and he made it the first time
[38:16] he tried and didn't fail and when he
[38:18] didn't fail amen he became worthy to be
[38:21] the lamb to be the propitiation to stand
[38:24] in our Gap because he didn't fail on the
[38:25] law
[38:26] so now he became our substitute he took
[38:29] our place amen so that we could be
[38:31] justified by faith
[38:33] praise God now let's turn together to
[38:35] Ezekiel keep your place in Romans we're
[38:37] coming right back to Romans but let's go
[38:39] to Ezekiel and read for just a minute
[38:40] Ezekiel chapter 33.
[38:48] this is a
[38:50] an amazing scripture
[38:58] Ezekiel 33 and let's begin reading in
[39:01] verse 10.
[39:03] therefore thou son of man speak unto the
[39:06] house of Israel thus you speak saying if
[39:09] our transgressions and our sins be upon
[39:11] us and we Pine away in them how shall we
[39:14] then live
[39:16] say unto them as I live saith the Lord
[39:18] God I have no pleasure in the death of
[39:21] the wicked so God takes no pleasure in
[39:23] the death of the wicked I have no
[39:24] pleasure in the death of the wicked but
[39:26] that the wicked turned from his way and
[39:28] live
[39:29] turn ye turn ye from your evil ways for
[39:32] why will you die o House of Israel
[39:35] therefore thou son of man say unto the
[39:38] children of thy people
[39:40] thy righteousness the righteousness of
[39:44] the righteous shall not deliver him in
[39:46] the day of his transgression
[39:49] this is a big saying I'm going to read
[39:51] it we'll go back and break it down as
[39:54] for the wickedness of the wicked he
[39:55] shall not fall thereby in the day that
[39:58] he turneth from his wickedness neither
[40:00] shall the righteous be able to live for
[40:02] his righteousness in the day that he
[40:04] sinneth
[40:05] when I shall say to the righteous that
[40:07] he shall surely live if he trusts to his
[40:10] own righteousness and commit iniquity
[40:12] all his righteousness shall not be
[40:14] remembered but for his iniquity that he
[40:16] hath committed he shall die for it
[40:19] is amazing
[40:21] let's go back and look at this a little
[40:23] bit carefully
[40:24] verse 12 second for the second line
[40:27] there third line the righteousness of
[40:29] the righteous shall not deliver him in
[40:32] the day of his transgression
[40:35] you can be righteous if it's a
[40:37] righteousness by the law if it's
[40:38] righteousness by works and by Deeds you
[40:41] can be righteous all of your life amen
[40:44] until one transgression
[40:48] and one transgression now none zero zero
[40:54] zero of your previous righteousness will
[40:56] cover this transgression
[40:59] now you are a transgressor
[41:02] now you are guilty of the law and worthy
[41:04] of death
[41:07] this is what he's telling the nation of
[41:09] Israel
[41:10] let's read this again
[41:12] this the righteousness of the righteous
[41:14] shall not deliver him in the day of his
[41:16] transgression
[41:18] so your righteousness won't deliver you
[41:19] the day you transgress
[41:21] you can't say I have a stockpile of
[41:23] righteousness
[41:24] I have a thousand Good Deeds
[41:27] a thousand times I obeyed the one time
[41:30] you failed is your destruction
[41:32] that's why the law was a Schoolmaster
[41:35] all right let's keep reading
[41:39] now this is what I love
[41:41] ask for the wickedness of the wicked he
[41:44] shall not fall thereby in the day that
[41:47] he turned from his wickedness
[41:49] so all your wickedness before you're not
[41:52] going to fall in the day you turn from
[41:54] your wickedness now all that can be
[41:56] erased
[42:00] praise God
[42:03] so shall the righteous be able to uh in
[42:06] the turn from his wickedness neither
[42:07] shall the righteous be able to live for
[42:09] his righteousness in the day that he
[42:11] sinneth
[42:12] when I shall say to the righteous that
[42:14] he shall surely live if he trusts to his
[42:16] own righteousness and commit iniquity
[42:18] all his righteousness shall not be
[42:20] remembered but for his iniquity that he
[42:23] hath committed he shall die for it
[42:26] I say
[42:27] my goodness there is no hope outside of
[42:30] Christ
[42:32] there is no hope outside of Grace amen
[42:35] and the problem is there's there's a
[42:37] Temptation amen through some legalistic
[42:40] ideas there's Notions of man that creep
[42:42] in all around I mean all these Spirits
[42:45] they don't die none of these Spirits die
[42:47] everything that's ever been has always
[42:48] been amen these spirits that they fought
[42:50] in the Bible were fighting today and
[42:52] this legalism Creeps in and tries to
[42:55] bring a security by Good Deeds Done
[42:59] right and then there's a comparison
[43:01] there's always the the security always
[43:04] comes into comparison
[43:06] and that's the that's the fallacy the
[43:08] security comes into comparison because
[43:10] I'm better than this I'm okay amen
[43:14] better than bad does it make you good
[43:20] less Fallen doesn't make you restored
[43:24] right
[43:25] but but also on the other end your whole
[43:29] pile of wickedness
[43:32] doesn't offset your turning to the Lord
[43:37] so it's not it's not like when man
[43:40] thinks and man looks and man Begins the
[43:42] way and you've done all of this and and
[43:45] and and all of this and I've done all of
[43:47] this and surely God will accept this and
[43:49] not that no my friend you can have
[43:51] somebody who live Wicked all of their
[43:53] life but turn to the Lord and God will
[43:55] cover all of that wickedness and declare
[43:57] them just and righteous and you can live
[43:59] clean all of your life and then go to
[44:01] wickedness Amen in all of your cleanness
[44:03] doesn't count now and all of their
[44:05] wickedness doesn't count now
[44:10] that's why I'm so glad we don't live
[44:11] under the law amen I get tired of having
[44:14] to be good for like a whole day let
[44:16] alone the whole week and then a whole
[44:18] life
[44:20] you just get wore out you just get
[44:22] exhausted
[44:24] but God didn't that that was a that was
[44:26] intended to teach us some things so that
[44:28] we can come to a whole nother way
[44:31] now look at this in the way of
[44:32] comparison the legalism
[44:34] Luke 18 verse 9 and he spake this
[44:37] Parable into certain which is trusted in
[44:39] themselves that they were righteous and
[44:41] despised others
[44:43] I want to ask you don't read anymore I
[44:45] have to go back
[44:47] because everybody reads ahead
[44:52] now
[44:54] have we ever seen I mean don't Point any
[44:57] fingers or call any names
[44:59] but have we ever seen those who trust in
[45:01] themselves and despise others
[45:03] trust trust in their own righteousness
[45:05] and look down on others
[45:10] that's an evil spirit
[45:13] and that Spirit listen very carefully
[45:16] that spirit is not there to destroy the
[45:19] wicked
[45:20] that spirit is not there to destroy the
[45:22] unbeliever that spirit is there to
[45:24] destroy the person who has that attitude
[45:27] the person who will be destroyed is not
[45:29] the one they're looking down upon but
[45:32] they are destroying themselves
[45:37] so here's what Jesus says
[45:40] speak this Parable unto certain which
[45:42] trusted in themselves and they were
[45:43] righteous and despised others
[45:45] two men went up into the temple to pray
[45:47] the one a Pharisee and the other
[45:48] Republican the Pharisees stood and
[45:50] prayed thus with himself God I thank
[45:53] thee that I am not as men are other men
[45:55] are extortioners unjust adulterers or
[45:58] even as this publican
[46:00] I fast twice in the week I give tithes
[46:02] of all that I possess and the public is
[46:04] standing afar off would not lift up so
[46:07] much as his eyes unto heaven but smote
[46:10] upon his breath saying God be ver be
[46:13] merciful to me a sinner
[46:15] I tell you this man went down to his
[46:18] house Justified
[46:20] Justified
[46:21] it's what Jesus says this man went down
[46:24] to his house Justified rather than the
[46:26] other for everyone that exalted
[46:28] themselves shall be abased and he that
[46:30] humbled himself shall be exalted
[46:33] you know what the the the spirit that
[46:37] would cause a man to be puffed up or
[46:38] legalistic or self-righteous that Spirit
[46:41] on that man is actually to keep that man
[46:44] from being righteous
[46:49] what
[46:50] the Pharisee Spirit or the spirit of
[46:52] legalism that would cause a man or woman
[46:55] to be self-righteous to look to their
[46:57] good deeds in Good Conduct for a level
[46:59] of righteousness that spirit is actually
[47:02] to keep them from being righteous
[47:06] because righteousness comes through
[47:08] humility repentance and recognition of
[47:11] what God's done for you not what you did
[47:13] so that spirit is actually to keep
[47:16] somebody away from righteousness not to
[47:18] make them righteous
[47:21] it's the opposite it does the opposite
[47:23] of what you think it would do
[47:25] but this Publican who is ashamed he was
[47:28] ashamed of himself ashamed of his sin
[47:31] acknowledging where he was didn't even
[47:34] so much as look up into heaven with his
[47:35] shame and smote upon his breasts and say
[47:37] God forgive me a sinner he went down to
[47:40] his house Justified
[47:42] he was forgiven that that Spirit of
[47:45] humility and Brokenness amen was
[47:48] actually pushing him to righteousness
[47:50] the spirit of Pride and
[47:51] self-righteousness was pushing him away
[47:53] from righteousness
[47:57] praise God
[47:59] amen
[48:00] God when he gave the law he wanted the
[48:04] people to need salvation by faith
[48:09] that's the point he wanted them to need
[48:12] something other than their ability to
[48:15] keep rules
[48:17] let's look at Romans 10 together
[48:23] Romans chapter 10.
[48:25] verse 1.
[48:35] Romans chapter 10 verse 1.
[48:40] Brethren my heart's desire and prayer to
[48:42] God for Israel is that they might be
[48:44] saved
[48:46] if I bear them record that they have a
[48:47] Zeal of God but not according to
[48:49] knowledge for they being ignorant of
[48:51] God's righteousness and going about to
[48:53] establish their own righteousness
[48:57] oh we just learned through the
[48:59] scriptures that that won't work
[49:01] we've just seen through the Old
[49:02] Testament to the scriptures that your
[49:04] own righteousness is a failure so for
[49:07] they being they were ignorant of God's
[49:09] righteousness and they were going about
[49:10] to establish their own righteousness
[49:12] that's why they were adding tradition to
[49:15] the law
[49:16] they were adding to tradition of washing
[49:18] pots and washing hands and different
[49:19] things they were adding tradition to the
[49:21] law because they were establishing their
[49:23] own righteousness
[49:24] the more they did the better they felt
[49:27] but it was a deception amen because it
[49:30] could never bring righteousness because
[49:31] they can never change amen their fallen
[49:34] nature
[49:35] they needed something else another life
[49:38] amen let's keep going
[49:41] uh
[49:43] they for they being ignorant of God's
[49:44] righteousness and going about to
[49:46] establish their own righteousness have
[49:47] not submitted themselves unto the
[49:49] righteousness of God
[49:51] for Christ is the end of the law for
[49:54] righteousness to everyone that believeth
[49:57] now the law won't make you righteous
[49:59] Christ is the end of the law for
[50:00] righteousness to those that believe
[50:03] for Moses described the righteousness
[50:06] which is of the law that the man which
[50:08] doeth those things shall live by them
[50:09] but the righteousness which is a face
[50:12] speaketh on this wise say not in thy
[50:14] heart who shall Ascend into heaven that
[50:16] is to bring Christ down from above or
[50:18] who shall descend into the deep that is
[50:19] to bring up Christ again from the dead
[50:22] but what saith that the word is nigh
[50:24] thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart
[50:26] that is the word of faith which we
[50:28] preach if Thou shalt confess with thy
[50:30] mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe
[50:32] in thine heart that God raised them from
[50:34] the dead Thou shalt be saved for with
[50:37] the heart man believeth unto
[50:39] righteousness and with the mouth
[50:40] confession is made into salvation for
[50:43] the scripture saith whosoever believeth
[50:45] on him shall not be ashamed
[50:48] amen the righteousness of faith is in Us
[50:53] by faith and coming out of us by what we
[50:56] say what we testify to
[50:58] what we confess
[51:00] it's in Us by faith
[51:03] I want to jump over to Roman back to
[51:05] Romans 8 really quick let's go back to
[51:07] Romans chapter 8.
[51:14] Romans chapter 8 and let's look at verse
[51:17] 28.
[51:21] and we know that all things work
[51:23] together for good to them that love God
[51:25] to them who are the called according to
[51:27] his purpose
[51:29] so now we're talking about the call the
[51:32] elect
[51:33] for whom he did for no he also did
[51:36] predestinate to be conformed to the
[51:38] image of his son that he might be the
[51:41] firstborn among many brethren
[51:43] listen our predestination is made clear
[51:46] here
[51:47] we are predestinated to be conformed to
[51:50] the image of a son
[51:52] you are predestinated to be like Christ
[51:56] that's what we're predestinated for
[51:59] not to not for a new ritual not for a
[52:03] new religion a new movement a new form
[52:04] of religion that's not what our
[52:06] predestination is for our predestination
[52:08] is so that we will be conformed into the
[52:10] image of his son
[52:13] amen that he might be the firstborn
[52:15] among many Brethren moreover whom he did
[52:18] predestinate then he also called whom he
[52:21] called then he also Justified whom he
[52:24] justified then he also glorified
[52:28] when were you Justified before the
[52:30] foundation of the world
[52:33] that's the same place I was
[52:34] predestinated that's the same place that
[52:36] God's call God's uh By God's
[52:39] foreknowledge it all took place in God's
[52:40] mind amen and then it's been playing out
[52:42] down through time
[52:44] but who God predestinated them he called
[52:46] whom he called he justified whom he
[52:48] justified then he hath already glorified
[52:51] amen I was justified in the mind of God
[52:53] when the lamb was slain before the
[52:55] foundation of the world
[52:57] but now God's God's playing it out amen
[53:00] demonstrating out what was in his mind
[53:02] praise God
[53:04] so now verse 31 what shall we then say
[53:07] to these things so now what do we say if
[53:10] God before us who can be against us
[53:13] he that spared not his own son but
[53:14] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[53:17] not with him also freely give us all
[53:19] things who shall lay anything to the
[53:22] charge of God's elect it is God that
[53:24] justify it
[53:26] who's going to call you guilty amen when
[53:29] God has Justified you
[53:32] who is he that condemneth it is Christ
[53:34] that died ye rather that risen again who
[53:36] is even at the right hand of God who
[53:39] also make intercession for us
[53:42] praise be to God
[53:44] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[53:46] God's elect it is God that justify it
[53:50] you weren't justified by your Deeds by
[53:52] your right actions by your right conduct
[53:54] by your willpower amen you were
[53:56] justified by grace
[54:00] by grace
[54:01] so now
[54:03] who can charge you
[54:06] acts 13 says be it known unto you
[54:09] therefore men and Brethren that through
[54:11] this man is preached unto you the
[54:13] Forgiveness of sins and by him all that
[54:16] believer Justified from all things from
[54:18] which you could not be justified by the
[54:21] law of Moses
[54:22] Moses could not justify you from all
[54:25] things
[54:26] and actually we know it was there as a
[54:28] school Master to bring condemnation
[54:31] but by but by him all that believe are
[54:36] Justified from all things
[54:39] that even the law of Moses couldn't
[54:41] justify you from
[54:44] but if you believe
[54:46] then you can be justified from all
[54:49] things
[54:50] and this is to me so amazing because you
[54:55] know there's a there's a an easy
[54:58] believism Doctrine you know around the
[55:00] world that all you got to do is believe
[55:02] and what took place historically
[55:05] and if all you'd believe is what took
[55:07] place historically that Jesus Christ God
[55:10] Came In the Flesh of Jesus Christ and he
[55:12] died on the cross to pay the price if
[55:14] you just believe that then you're
[55:16] Justified from all things
[55:18] but you remember when Jesus came on the
[55:22] scene amen the the Pharisees they were
[55:25] believing their Bible
[55:27] they were believing their Bible they
[55:28] were believing Moses they were trying to
[55:30] keep the ordinances amen but Jesus
[55:33] Christ was the word made flesh Jesus
[55:35] Christ is the word made flesh
[55:38] so Christ is the word made flesh and now
[55:41] the word was made flesh and Dwight Among
[55:43] Us and while he was there he was the
[55:45] word he was the law he was the prophets
[55:47] he was at all and then he was there in
[55:50] fulfillment of it all amen and they were
[55:52] rejecting him but holding to the
[55:55] historical God
[55:58] right
[55:59] and they were not justified by holding
[56:02] on to the historical they were justified
[56:03] by receiving present tense truth the
[56:06] word amen and and when you receive
[56:09] Christ you receive all that he ever was
[56:14] the law of the prophets the Patriarchs
[56:16] the Psalms the Proverbs all that he ever
[56:18] was he is
[56:21] and when you receive the I am you get
[56:23] what he was
[56:26] if you look to what he was but reject
[56:28] the I am what do you have
[56:32] you're in the same place the Jews were
[56:34] in the day that Christ was walking on
[56:36] Earth
[56:37] that's not the place we want to be
[56:39] so to him and by him all that believer
[56:42] Justified from all things
[56:46] let's look at Galatians Chapter 2 now
[56:48] Galatians
[56:56] Galatians chapter 2 verse 16.
[57:02] Galatians 2 and 16. knowing that a man
[57:05] is not justified by The Works of the law
[57:07] but by the faith of Jesus Christ
[57:11] I love that the faith of Jesus Christ
[57:15] not just faith in Jesus Christ
[57:18] but you need the faith of Jesus Christ
[57:21] you need the original faith
[57:23] amen
[57:25] let's read that again knowing that a man
[57:26] is not justified by The Works of the law
[57:28] but by the faith of Jesus Christ even we
[57:31] even we have believed in Jesus Christ
[57:34] that we might be justified by the Faith
[57:37] of Christ and not by The Works of the
[57:39] law for by The Works of the law shall no
[57:41] flesh be justified
[57:43] but if while we seek to be justified by
[57:46] Christ we ourselves also are found
[57:48] Sinners is there is therefore Christ the
[57:51] minister of sin God forbid for if I
[57:53] build again these things which I
[57:55] destroyed I make myself a transgressor
[57:57] he's speaking against the judaizers and
[57:59] those who are stuck in between because
[58:00] just above this he says that when when
[58:03] certain Brethren came from James unto um
[58:06] Antioch amen that Peter separated stuff
[58:08] from the Jews and started practicing
[58:10] some of the old Jewish traditions and
[58:11] separating and not eating with the Jews
[58:13] and and and Barnabas was carried away
[58:15] into dissimulation and Paul had to bring
[58:18] a correction to that and now he's
[58:19] talking about that if I make myself a
[58:22] sinner again what have you done you've
[58:24] separated you've gone back to the law
[58:25] and Kenny with a gentile you've made
[58:27] yourself guilty again
[58:30] that's what he said so now if I if I'm
[58:33] if I make my righteousness by if I make
[58:36] my justification in righteousness by
[58:38] keeping of the law I have just made
[58:40] myself guilty all over again I've just
[58:42] condemned myself
[58:43] that's why legalism today is so
[58:46] dangerous because if I make keeping the
[58:48] law and keeping the doctrines amen my
[58:51] salvation I have just condemned myself
[58:53] again because all my righteousness
[58:55] doesn't count the day of my iniquity
[58:59] and all that I did before doesn't count
[59:01] the time of my transgression
[59:03] so if we build again those things that
[59:06] we destroyed how shall we be saved
[59:10] if I build again the things which I
[59:11] destroyed Verse 18 I make myself a
[59:13] transgressor
[59:14] for I through the law am dead to the law
[59:17] that I might live unto God
[59:20] I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[59:22] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[59:25] and the life which I now live in the
[59:27] flesh I live by the faith of the son of
[59:30] God
[59:31] he wasn't even living it by his own
[59:34] faith human Faith he was living by the
[59:36] faith of the Son of God the original
[59:38] faith who loved me and gave himself for
[59:41] me I do not frustrate the grace of God
[59:44] for if righteousness came by the law
[59:46] then Christ is dead in vain
[59:52] amen
[59:54] praise God
[59:56] I think it's amazing
[59:58] these these scriptures this principle is
[1:00:01] so amazing but it's so amazing too the
[1:00:04] spirits don't die
[1:00:05] and we have to fight those same Spirits
[1:00:07] sometimes
[1:00:08] and like I said before I I am not
[1:00:11] interested in loose living
[1:00:13] in fact there's many things many
[1:00:16] convictions personal convictions that I
[1:00:19] have that I never preach
[1:00:21] because they're for me because of where
[1:00:23] god holds me to and holds me back from
[1:00:25] and things that I'm not free in my
[1:00:27] spirit to do that I Don't Preach that
[1:00:29] because I don't believe in loose living
[1:00:31] I don't believe in claiming uh
[1:00:34] justification by faith through Grace and
[1:00:36] then I will go out and live contrary to
[1:00:38] the word and contrary to the nature of
[1:00:39] Christ I don't believe in that
[1:00:42] but neither do I believe that me you
[1:00:45] know following my own convictions and
[1:00:47] doing everything that I can see the
[1:00:49] prophet say the message that doesn't
[1:00:51] equal my righteousness either
[1:00:56] Paul says now the life I live
[1:00:59] I live in the flesh I don't live it but
[1:01:02] Christ I live by the faith of the son of
[1:01:05] God
[1:01:05] not living by my own faith not living by
[1:01:08] my own efforts I'm not living by all of
[1:01:09] that now I'm living by the faith of the
[1:01:12] Son of God the life I now live in the
[1:01:13] flesh I live by the faith of the son of
[1:01:15] God
[1:01:16] I do not frustrate the the grace I do
[1:01:19] not frustrate Grace because all the law
[1:01:22] keeping in the world
[1:01:23] doesn't produce justification
[1:01:26] it doesn't produce righteousness
[1:01:29] righteousness is imputed
[1:01:32] declared
[1:01:34] put on you
[1:01:37] by God
[1:01:38] by grace
[1:01:40] we're going to look at that
[1:01:43] so I hope nobody thinks we're going in
[1:01:46] another Direction it doesn't understand
[1:01:47] where I'm going
[1:01:48] I believe if the spirit of Beethoven was
[1:01:51] in me I'd write symphonies
[1:01:55] and I also believe that if the spirit of
[1:01:57] Dillinger was in me I'd rob banks
[1:02:01] so whatever spirit I have received will
[1:02:04] manifest itself in my life
[1:02:07] and if I have received the spirit of
[1:02:08] Christ who is the anointed word I will
[1:02:12] live the anointed word I will live the
[1:02:15] word
[1:02:16] so I'm not going to claim Grace and make
[1:02:19] it a disgrace by living another life it
[1:02:22] just shows that I have another Spirit
[1:02:23] that's operating in my control tower
[1:02:29] praise God that's the difference that's
[1:02:32] the death of legalism but it's not the
[1:02:34] death of a Christian Life
[1:02:36] the death of legalism is not is not
[1:02:40] freedom to live any way you want well no
[1:02:42] it is freedom to live any way you want
[1:02:45] it is it's freedom to live any way you
[1:02:47] want
[1:02:48] and if you want to live some other way
[1:02:50] than the word in some other way than
[1:02:51] what the prophet God I would go back and
[1:02:53] think of what Spirit you've received
[1:02:57] because the spirit of Christ says Amen
[1:02:59] to the word it's the word Spirit of the
[1:03:00] word saying Amen to the word and lining
[1:03:02] up to the word
[1:03:05] so if I want to claim Grace and the
[1:03:08] Liberty in Christ and go and live in a
[1:03:11] way that's contrary to the word that God
[1:03:13] has given us and the instructions
[1:03:14] through his mouthpiece in our day then
[1:03:16] I'm I'm questioning to me I would go
[1:03:19] back and question why you have such
[1:03:21] Liberty to violate a prophet of God and
[1:03:24] violate instructions from God and
[1:03:26] violate the word of God
[1:03:28] where did that Liberty come from
[1:03:32] so you see the truth is always down the
[1:03:34] middle
[1:03:35] not on this side and it's not on this
[1:03:37] side the truth is down the middle
[1:03:43] so uh Second Corinthians 5 21 for he
[1:03:48] hath made him to be sin for us who knew
[1:03:51] no sin that we might be made the
[1:03:53] righteousness of God in him
[1:03:57] I want to ask you
[1:03:58] is the righteousness of God a good
[1:04:01] righteousness
[1:04:03] I mean what level would you put that on
[1:04:06] I put it up top the righteousness of God
[1:04:09] I haven't made myself and I haven't
[1:04:11] earned or worked my way up to I have
[1:04:14] been made placed put conditioned
[1:04:17] imparted however you want to say it I
[1:04:19] might be made the righteous of God in
[1:04:22] him
[1:04:22] it's God's righteousness to justify
[1:04:25] because God Amen as a righteous God as a
[1:04:28] just God he paid the penalty himself to
[1:04:31] free us and that gives him the right to
[1:04:33] make us we we become his righteousness
[1:04:35] money justifies us
[1:04:37] because he's already paid the price
[1:04:40] amen
[1:04:42] Romans chapter 4 verse 1 what shall we
[1:04:45] say then that Abraham our father is
[1:04:46] pertaining to flesh has found for If
[1:04:49] Abraham were justified by works he hath
[1:04:50] whereupto Glory but not before God for
[1:04:54] what saith the scriptures what saith the
[1:04:56] scripture Abraham believed God and it
[1:04:59] was counted unto him for righteousness
[1:05:04] Abraham believed God
[1:05:06] and it's not that Abraham was doing
[1:05:08] righteous because we know some
[1:05:10] unrighteous things that Abraham did
[1:05:12] we can read the Bible
[1:05:15] but because he believed God it was
[1:05:19] counted unto him for righteousness are
[1:05:21] imputed
[1:05:23] or put on
[1:05:25] or accounted to
[1:05:28] all right
[1:05:29] let's say somebody wants to give me a
[1:05:31] million dollars
[1:05:32] and I'm open to that
[1:05:35] so it doesn't just have to be a parable
[1:05:37] I mean it can Manifest this
[1:05:40] if somebody does a transfer into my
[1:05:43] account
[1:05:45] think about this
[1:05:47] they have made me a millionaire
[1:05:51] it was accounted unto me or imputed unto
[1:05:54] me
[1:05:55] I did not make myself a millionaire
[1:06:00] I did not make myself righteous I did
[1:06:02] not make myself just Abraham did not
[1:06:05] make himself just Abraham did not make
[1:06:07] himself righteous amen but all Abraham
[1:06:10] did is all that he could do because he
[1:06:12] was the seed of God is Abraham believed
[1:06:15] God
[1:06:17] and if somebody says brother Chad I want
[1:06:20] to transfer a million dollars into your
[1:06:21] account and I believe them
[1:06:24] and give them my account number and my
[1:06:28] routing number and I believe them amen
[1:06:30] all listen all I have to do in order to
[1:06:34] receive the million dollars is believe
[1:06:35] them
[1:06:37] and they will impart it into my account
[1:06:39] and now it's counted unto me
[1:06:43] and I've been made
[1:06:45] a millionaire
[1:06:49] but if I don't believe them
[1:06:53] and I don't surrender and I don't
[1:06:55] acknowledge and I and I hold back
[1:06:58] then I'm not going to be a millionaire
[1:07:01] it's pretty easy
[1:07:03] so that doesn't have to just be a
[1:07:04] parable I mean it can flesh out
[1:07:07] if we wanted to
[1:07:09] so
[1:07:11] Abraham believed God and it was counted
[1:07:13] unto him for righteousness
[1:07:15] now to him that worketh is the reward
[1:07:18] not reckoned of Grace but of debt
[1:07:20] wow
[1:07:22] God owes me
[1:07:25] God
[1:07:26] I paid my tithes I went to church I've
[1:07:30] listened to the message I read my Bible
[1:07:32] every day like the prophet said
[1:07:36] you now owe me
[1:07:42] no God's not in debt to you
[1:07:45] if God gives you anything it's by Grace
[1:07:48] not by debt
[1:07:50] God didn't owe you salvation he didn't
[1:07:52] owe you Deliverance he didn't owe you
[1:07:55] provision he didn't owe you healing he
[1:07:57] didn't owe you anything and all of your
[1:07:59] good deeds is not going into a bank
[1:08:01] account that someday you can cash into
[1:08:03] God for an exchange of services
[1:08:07] if we get anything it's by God's grace
[1:08:10] because he wanted us to have it and he
[1:08:12] wanted to give it to us he made the
[1:08:14] provision he made the way when we come
[1:08:16] his provided way then he by his grace
[1:08:19] fulfills his promise and his word and
[1:08:21] gives us what he's promised to give us
[1:08:22] not by debt but by grace
[1:08:28] him that worketh is the reward not
[1:08:30] reckon of Grace but of dead but to him
[1:08:32] that worketh not but believeth on him
[1:08:35] that justified the ungodly his faith is
[1:08:37] counted for righteousness
[1:08:40] not because what you did but because of
[1:08:42] who you believed in
[1:08:43] even as David also described the
[1:08:45] blessedness of the man unto whom God
[1:08:47] imputed righteousness without works
[1:08:49] saying blessed are they whose iniquity
[1:08:51] are forgiven and whose sins are covered
[1:08:53] blessed is the man to whom the Lord will
[1:08:56] not impute sin
[1:09:00] I want to be one of those
[1:09:02] Romans chapter 5 therefore being
[1:09:04] justified by faith we have peace with
[1:09:06] God through our Lord Jesus Christ by
[1:09:08] whom also we have access
[1:09:11] by faith unto this Grace wherein we
[1:09:15] stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory
[1:09:17] of God
[1:09:18] so now
[1:09:20] we've been
[1:09:22] brought into peace we've been justified
[1:09:24] by faith
[1:09:25] we have peace with God through our Lord
[1:09:26] Jesus Christ because God was appeased by
[1:09:29] the sacrifice
[1:09:31] it brought us in peace now we were
[1:09:33] separated by sin but the but the but the
[1:09:35] sacrifice for sin restored Unity
[1:09:41] by whom also by Christ whom also we have
[1:09:45] access by faith to this grace
[1:09:50] is available how do I access the grace
[1:09:54] Grace is to the elect Graces to God's
[1:09:57] children how do I access that grace
[1:09:59] through faith
[1:10:01] through faith I access the grace
[1:10:06] so so that's part of why my title says
[1:10:10] righteous
[1:10:11] righteousness by justification
[1:10:14] I'm not righteous by Deeds I'm righteous
[1:10:16] because he said you're Justified he's
[1:10:19] the justifier
[1:10:21] when he says you're just just as if you
[1:10:24] never did it before that makes me
[1:10:26] righteous
[1:10:27] because he said I'm just
[1:10:30] how did I become just by faith
[1:10:33] how did I have faith by grace
[1:10:37] by grace
[1:10:40] oh God is so good
[1:10:44] for by grace are you saved through faith
[1:10:47] and that not of yourself it is the gift
[1:10:52] of God not of Works lest any man should
[1:10:54] boast for we are his workmanship created
[1:10:56] in Christ Jesus under good works which
[1:10:58] God hath before ordained that we should
[1:11:00] walk in them
[1:11:01] so praise be to God
[1:11:04] by grace
[1:11:06] I have faith
[1:11:08] by faith I've been Justified and by
[1:11:11] being justified I've been declared
[1:11:13] righteous
[1:11:15] righteous by justification justification
[1:11:18] by faith faith by grace
[1:11:21] and when it's all said and done what did
[1:11:24] we do anyhow
[1:11:26] for he put a seed of predestination down
[1:11:29] on the inside of us and gave us a
[1:11:32] receptor to the word and something to
[1:11:34] believe with
[1:11:36] by his grace which is his love
[1:11:40] at the end of the day no wonder no
[1:11:44] wonder we throw our crowns at his feet
[1:11:46] no wonder we give Glory and Honor unto
[1:11:48] him because what did we do anyhow
[1:11:51] if we could get to this place we're all
[1:11:53] Pride all self-sufficiency all arrogancy
[1:11:56] all all of this nonsense can fade away
[1:11:59] and we can get to the reality that I am
[1:12:01] here by Grace I'm saved by grace I'm
[1:12:03] kept by Grace it was all in God's mind
[1:12:05] before the foundation of the world I
[1:12:07] didn't Merit it I didn't earn it I
[1:12:09] didn't do anything he determined before
[1:12:12] and and he requires now that to enter
[1:12:15] into this grace you must access it by
[1:12:17] faith but he gives you a seed of faith
[1:12:20] and grants and unlocks the faith so that
[1:12:22] you can believe so that you can
[1:12:24] apprehend the grace
[1:12:26] so that you can be justified
[1:12:28] and declare righteous
[1:12:31] all I can say is thank you Lord
[1:12:34] thank you Lord and when we know the
[1:12:37] vessel that he used to purchase our
[1:12:39] freedom was when he made himself a body
[1:12:41] to dwell in amen that's why amen that's
[1:12:44] why I'm looking forward to today that I
[1:12:47] can see him in flesh
[1:12:50] because by that flesh that was the Lamb
[1:12:53] of God by that vessel that contained the
[1:12:55] blood of God that went to Calvary and
[1:12:58] shed his blood for me freed me from the
[1:13:00] bondage of sin so that I could go free
[1:13:03] by the grace of God it would be a
[1:13:05] pleasure for me to bow at those feet
[1:13:10] we know that's not this dispensation but
[1:13:12] I'm looking forward to it
[1:13:15] because it's a privilege to say thank
[1:13:18] you
[1:13:19] thank you thank you for what you did for
[1:13:22] me
[1:13:25] I don't think anybody's going to be
[1:13:26] proud
[1:13:27] and the married supper
[1:13:30] I knew I would be here
[1:13:35] I
[1:13:36] I told God I prayed every day I I
[1:13:42] come on
[1:13:45] if we get there it'll be his grace
[1:13:48] and we'll be so thankful
[1:13:52] amen but I love this
[1:13:56] Ephesians 2 8 I love how it says it
[1:13:58] starts off for by grace are you saved
[1:14:00] through faith
[1:14:01] that honor of yourselves is the gift of
[1:14:03] God
[1:14:04] not of Works lest any man should boast
[1:14:06] you can't be proud about obtaining this
[1:14:08] grace
[1:14:10] you can't be proud about believing
[1:14:13] you can't be proud listen we can't be
[1:14:15] proud about believing
[1:14:17] neither should we be angry with others
[1:14:19] who don't believe
[1:14:22] Because unless we had a seat of
[1:14:24] predestination
[1:14:26] unless we were part of that
[1:14:28] predestinated plan of God Amen we
[1:14:31] couldn't believe
[1:14:32] so we can believe because he
[1:14:35] predestinated his true belief that
[1:14:37] doesn't make us better or proud or
[1:14:39] arrogant all it does is put us in a
[1:14:41] position by grace
[1:14:43] and so now I can't get angry at those
[1:14:46] who don't believe I should have pity
[1:14:48] sympathy remorse and intercede for those
[1:14:51] who can't believe because I'm in a
[1:14:53] different position by God's grace
[1:14:57] I should I should say oh God help them
[1:14:59] amen amen help them to see open their
[1:15:02] eyes I shouldn't get angry at them I
[1:15:04] shouldn't throw stones at them why
[1:15:06] should I go to another level why should
[1:15:09] I lower myself to a level of unbelief
[1:15:10] and conduct like unbelievers like I
[1:15:12] don't know why I hate I'm here and who I
[1:15:14] am
[1:15:17] so so now all of a sudden because of the
[1:15:22] position I'm in by Grace now I have
[1:15:24] sympathy and now I I have pity and I
[1:15:27] have remorse when somebody just can't
[1:15:28] see and I can say God open their eyes
[1:15:31] and if they're not predestinated unto
[1:15:34] the word amen just give them the heart
[1:15:36] to show respect amen just give them the
[1:15:38] heart to be kind Lord because I want to
[1:15:40] see them saved in the end
[1:15:44] enter we want to intercede not you you
[1:15:47] spoke evil of me and you come against
[1:15:49] this and you said that I you're going to
[1:15:51] get it I don't want you to get it
[1:15:55] that's why if it was up to me right now
[1:15:57] I wouldn't be a very good judge
[1:16:00] because if God asked me everybody gets
[1:16:02] to go free
[1:16:04] you're like brother Chad would you set
[1:16:05] the criminals the rapists the convicts
[1:16:07] would you set them free I would set
[1:16:08] every one of them free every one of them
[1:16:10] free because by whatever measure you
[1:16:12] judge is the same judgment you'll
[1:16:14] receive
[1:16:15] and if I analyze my life real quick and
[1:16:18] all the wrong desires I've had and that
[1:16:20] sticky conquerber nature that's still
[1:16:22] there amen amen how can I condemn when I
[1:16:26] can find the seeds of those things still
[1:16:28] in my flesh
[1:16:29] and the ability to do the same thing is
[1:16:32] still there the only thing keeping me
[1:16:33] from it is the Life of Christ on the
[1:16:35] inside
[1:16:36] so how in the world can I condemn if it
[1:16:39] was up to me right now in the state I am
[1:16:41] now I say everybody goes free everybody
[1:16:44] gets a pass it doesn't matter what you
[1:16:45] do you get to go because by whatever
[1:16:47] judgment I judge that would be needed to
[1:16:50] me
[1:16:53] that's why something has to change in us
[1:16:55] before we get to the white Throne
[1:16:56] judgment
[1:16:57] so that we can actually have righteous
[1:16:59] judgment
[1:17:01] because right now I want everybody to go
[1:17:02] free get a pass
[1:17:05] what about the people who have wronged
[1:17:06] you I want them to have a pass
[1:17:08] because if I and I pray there's people
[1:17:11] who have wronged me just done wrong said
[1:17:14] wrong said things that weren't true it
[1:17:15] just wasn't right and I pray that God
[1:17:18] forgives them and I pray this way God do
[1:17:20] not ever hold them accountable for me I
[1:17:23] forgive them and don't judge them on my
[1:17:25] account as far as I'm concerned they're
[1:17:27] free
[1:17:30] now whatever happens is not because of
[1:17:33] what they did to me because I forgave
[1:17:36] them
[1:17:39] why because I have said wrong things
[1:17:42] about other people
[1:17:44] I've said things I shouldn't have I
[1:17:47] gossiped when I shouldn't have I I
[1:17:49] condemn somebody before I knew all the
[1:17:51] details
[1:17:52] and I'm not talking 10 years ago I'm
[1:17:54] talking probably this past week
[1:17:57] I had something wrong I misjudged
[1:17:59] something I said something a little too
[1:18:02] quick and passed the Judgment amen and
[1:18:04] so what if that what if that person
[1:18:06] wants to hold me accountable for my
[1:18:08] actions and I went home I say God let
[1:18:10] them go amen let them go on my account
[1:18:13] don't judge them because of me I forgive
[1:18:16] them
[1:18:18] remember it was Jesus who was nailed to
[1:18:20] the cross and said father forgive them
[1:18:21] they don't know what they're doing
[1:18:24] and it was Stephen who was being stoned
[1:18:26] amen and as he was being stoned he says
[1:18:28] father lay not this sin to their charge
[1:18:30] and who was standing there consenting to
[1:18:33] the stoning watching over the garments
[1:18:35] of those that were stoning it was Saul
[1:18:37] who would become Paul amen and what
[1:18:39] would have happened to Paul if so if if
[1:18:42] Stephen would have said God don't ever
[1:18:44] forget what they did and hold every one
[1:18:46] of them accountable
[1:18:48] Hey listen Stephen was the son of God
[1:18:50] with authority and a power and and
[1:18:52] listen if he if he wouldn't have
[1:18:54] released them I don't know what would
[1:18:56] have happened but there it is stoning he
[1:18:58] released everybody who was doing him
[1:19:01] wrong so that God could come by and pick
[1:19:04] up Saul later
[1:19:07] did Saul suffered first wrong yes it's
[1:19:09] all have regrets absolutely did God deal
[1:19:11] with Saul's the son yes absolutely
[1:19:15] but I often think what would have
[1:19:17] happened if Stephen would have said God
[1:19:18] don't ever forget what they did to me
[1:19:22] listen when the Patriarchs the sons have
[1:19:25] gone fast when they spoke it happened
[1:19:28] when they blessed it was blessed what
[1:19:30] was cursed was cursed
[1:19:34] Jesus nailed to the cross the fence was
[1:19:36] against him in the flesh
[1:19:38] he said father forgive them
[1:19:42] and
[1:19:43] just
[1:19:44] 40 days 50 days later 50 days later at
[1:19:47] Pentecost
[1:19:48] 3 000 were saved
[1:19:51] I say thank God
[1:19:54] I
[1:19:56] want to dish out Mercy Mercy Mercy Mercy
[1:20:02] I I regret the times that I haven't
[1:20:06] I regret the times I've been hardlined
[1:20:08] and hard-nosed and critical and
[1:20:10] legalistic I regret them all
[1:20:13] because I want people to have Grace
[1:20:16] amen
[1:20:19] I'd rather God judged than me judge
[1:20:22] because I hate Boomerang judgment
[1:20:26] through it and it comes back
[1:20:33] I'm sending the message we would see
[1:20:34] Jesus notice
[1:20:36] and here he stood doing exactly the
[1:20:38] Messiah sign
[1:20:40] in just one now and then I'm sorry I
[1:20:43] jumped ahead of myself
[1:20:45] I got off on a tangent
[1:20:47] I want to hit this before I get to that
[1:20:49] next quote
[1:20:51] we're saved through faith
[1:20:54] and that not of ourselves is the gift of
[1:20:56] God
[1:20:57] by Grace We're safe through faith
[1:21:00] not of Works lest any man should boast
[1:21:01] now look at the next part
[1:21:04] for we are his workmanship
[1:21:07] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:21:10] which God hath before ordained that we
[1:21:12] should walk in them
[1:21:14] he's immediately addressing the
[1:21:16] situation of works
[1:21:18] will you do righteous Works absolutely
[1:21:25] The Works won't produce righteousness
[1:21:27] but but
[1:21:29] your faith will produce works
[1:21:33] we are his workmanship we're his
[1:21:35] creation created in Christ Jesus to do
[1:21:38] good works
[1:21:39] God didn't call us and create us to do
[1:21:41] evil
[1:21:43] he didn't create us to compromise on the
[1:21:44] word he didn't bring us into salvation
[1:21:46] for us to live any way no we are created
[1:21:49] unto good works that he had before
[1:21:51] ordained that we should walk in them
[1:21:53] God knows how we're going to walk God
[1:21:55] knows what this conversion will do God
[1:21:57] knows what this Grace will produce God
[1:21:59] knows what his life and the individual
[1:22:01] will produce
[1:22:02] and he's already ordained that we walk
[1:22:04] in those good works
[1:22:05] praise be to God
[1:22:07] and James let's turn to James chapter 2
[1:22:09] together
[1:22:11] I don't want to leave this little bit
[1:22:12] undone I want to hit it right now
[1:22:15] James chapter 2.
[1:22:29] James chapter 2 verse 17.
[1:22:36] all right James 2 and 17.
[1:22:40] even so faith if it hath not works is
[1:22:43] dead being alone
[1:22:46] listen it looks like James now is going
[1:22:49] to contradict Romans contradict Paul
[1:22:52] but Ephesians already laid this out
[1:22:55] it showed that we're saved by grace
[1:22:57] through faith and not out of ourselves
[1:22:58] not of work since any man should boast
[1:23:00] but where his creation ordained in the
[1:23:02] good works
[1:23:03] but we're going to produce good works
[1:23:06] this is what James is really pointing to
[1:23:10] he says if so faith if it hath not works
[1:23:12] is dead being alone
[1:23:14] yea a man may say thou has faith and I
[1:23:16] have worked show me thy faith without
[1:23:18] thy works and I will show thee my faith
[1:23:20] by by my works
[1:23:22] thou believe isn't that there is one God
[1:23:24] thou thou do as well the Devils also
[1:23:27] believe and tremble
[1:23:29] so he's what Paul what I'm sorry what
[1:23:32] James is saying is you believe there's
[1:23:34] one God the Devils do but they don't do
[1:23:36] righteous work
[1:23:38] your faith should produce a different
[1:23:40] life
[1:23:41] so somebody says I believe two people
[1:23:44] say I believe just watch their life what
[1:23:46] they believe will manifest itself
[1:23:49] this is what he's saying
[1:23:52] amen
[1:23:54] oh where am I
[1:23:56] uh verse
[1:23:58] 19 yeah thou believest there is one God
[1:24:01] thou do as well the Devils also believe
[1:24:03] in Trimble but wilt thou know o vain man
[1:24:05] that faith without works is dead
[1:24:09] was it not Abraham Our Father justified
[1:24:11] by works when he had offered Isaac his
[1:24:13] son upon the altar listen the the
[1:24:16] Apostle Paul said he was justified by
[1:24:18] faith
[1:24:19] and now James was saying wasn't he
[1:24:21] justified by works
[1:24:22] let's just look at it
[1:24:24] see us now how Faith wrought with his
[1:24:26] works and by works was Faith made
[1:24:28] perfect
[1:24:29] or complete perfect doesn't mean that
[1:24:31] Faith was imperfect and it needed Works
[1:24:33] to make it perfect this perfect means
[1:24:35] mature or complete When Faith Comes to
[1:24:37] Perfection it lives a life
[1:24:39] it produces the work
[1:24:41] and the scripture was fulfilled with
[1:24:43] saith Abraham believed God and it was
[1:24:45] imputed unto him for righteousness and
[1:24:47] he was called the friend of God you see
[1:24:50] then how that by works a man is
[1:24:52] Justified and not by faith only likewise
[1:24:54] also was not Rahab the Harlot justified
[1:24:57] by works when she had received the
[1:24:58] messengers and then sent them out
[1:25:00] another way for as the body without the
[1:25:02] spirit is dead so faith without works is
[1:25:05] dead also
[1:25:07] all right there's no contradiction
[1:25:10] they're saying the same thing from a
[1:25:12] different angle all the righteous works
[1:25:15] that Abraham could do would not produce
[1:25:17] righteousness
[1:25:19] but faith when he believed God it was
[1:25:21] imputed in him for righteousness and the
[1:25:23] Very evidence that he had Faith was that
[1:25:26] he obeyed what the voice told him to do
[1:25:29] and his obedience was a declaration or
[1:25:31] the full maturity or the Perfection of
[1:25:34] his faith
[1:25:35] showing that he did exactly he said I
[1:25:38] believe if you would have said If
[1:25:40] Abraham would have believed God and was
[1:25:42] accounting him for righteousness but he
[1:25:44] didn't go off for Isaac he didn't
[1:25:46] believe God
[1:25:48] so how could he be righteous if he
[1:25:50] wouldn't go do what God Said do
[1:25:52] does that make sense
[1:25:54] so his righteousness is imputed because
[1:25:56] he believed God
[1:25:58] not he believed in God
[1:26:03] the whole world believes in God
[1:26:05] nearly
[1:26:06] the by and large the majority believes
[1:26:08] in God it wasn't that Abraham believed
[1:26:10] in God that got him righteous he
[1:26:12] believed what God told him in his day
[1:26:16] he believed the present tense truth he
[1:26:18] believed the word for his hour he
[1:26:20] believed God and it was imputed in him
[1:26:22] for righteousness
[1:26:25] but if he would have said I believe God
[1:26:28] but never would have moved from his Camp
[1:26:30] never moved with Isaac never went to
[1:26:32] Moriah never went to make an offering
[1:26:35] his very Works testify he doesn't
[1:26:37] believe
[1:26:39] right but when he believed God he went
[1:26:44] into action to do what God told him to
[1:26:46] do
[1:26:48] in the hour that he lived
[1:26:51] and when he went to perform the word of
[1:26:53] God Amen now James is looking at this as
[1:26:57] the Fulfillment or the Out product or
[1:27:00] the perfecting of his faith
[1:27:02] so if I say that I believe the message
[1:27:05] of this hour amen but I don't believe
[1:27:07] what the message says
[1:27:11] then I'm giving evidence my faith is not
[1:27:13] come into Perfection yet amen but when I
[1:27:16] believe that this word is true and then
[1:27:18] my life begins to line up to the word
[1:27:20] amen though my life becomes evident that
[1:27:23] I believe
[1:27:25] praise God you can't get it backwards
[1:27:29] praise the Lord
[1:27:31] brother Ben says in the message
[1:27:32] perseverance
[1:27:34] speaking about this these two passages
[1:27:36] of scripture he says and the whole armor
[1:27:38] of God is Faith love joy peace
[1:27:40] long-suffering goodness meekness
[1:27:41] gentleness patience the whole armor of
[1:27:44] the believer is faith we believe God by
[1:27:46] faith because God said so then what is
[1:27:49] it Abraham was justified by Paul by
[1:27:52] faith but by James by works
[1:27:55] Abraham was talking what God saw and
[1:27:58] James was talking what man saw show me
[1:28:01] your faith by your Works without your
[1:28:02] works and so forth see then if you don't
[1:28:04] have works with your faith it shows you
[1:28:06] haven't got faith you're just talking
[1:28:07] with your mouth
[1:28:10] but if you really got faith you believe
[1:28:11] in act like it that's right put it in
[1:28:14] action
[1:28:15] so that's what they're talking about the
[1:28:17] two sides of the same picture
[1:28:19] he goes on in here to say in this
[1:28:22] message notice
[1:28:23] here he stood doing exactly the Messiah
[1:28:25] sign
[1:28:26] and just one now and then of the Jews
[1:28:29] would believe him now there was those
[1:28:31] there who would not believe him and you
[1:28:34] couldn't say they wasn't good men
[1:28:36] no sir they were good men they had to
[1:28:39] live good you couldn't say they wasn't
[1:28:40] honest and upright and couldn't wouldn't
[1:28:42] cheat or steal no sir but them things
[1:28:44] don't save you
[1:28:46] it's not by Good Works you are saved if
[1:28:49] good works would it would have done it
[1:28:50] Christ wouldn't have had to die
[1:28:53] you see it's a birth Brother Bear is
[1:28:56] bringing it now to the birth amen the
[1:28:58] new birth
[1:28:59] you see it's a birth you've got to be
[1:29:02] born again you just got to be there's no
[1:29:05] way out out at all out sorry there's no
[1:29:09] way at all out of it except a man be
[1:29:11] born again he will know why see the
[1:29:13] kingdom now look sin is not lying
[1:29:16] stealing during I I'm going to scroll
[1:29:18] this text up because this is an amazing
[1:29:21] part of this quote and we just quoted a
[1:29:23] few weeks ago
[1:29:25] sin is not lying stealing drinking
[1:29:27] committing adultery that's not sin
[1:29:28] that's the attributes of unbelief the
[1:29:31] only sin there is is unbelief
[1:29:34] the only righteousness there is is faith
[1:29:39] not Deeds
[1:29:41] the only sin there is is unbelief the
[1:29:44] only righteousness there is is faith
[1:29:48] amen unrighteous Deeds come from
[1:29:51] unbelief
[1:29:52] righteous Deeds come from Faith from The
[1:29:55] Life of Christ on the inside you've
[1:29:57] received the faith of Jesus Christ
[1:29:59] and it produces the life of Jesus Christ
[1:30:01] that doesn't mean we don't make mistakes
[1:30:03] and we don't fail but it's the life
[1:30:05] within us that brings us to a quick
[1:30:06] repentance and lines us back up to the
[1:30:08] word and keeps us walking that way
[1:30:11] it's a different life
[1:30:13] the only righteousness there is is faith
[1:30:18] Titus says not by works of righteousness
[1:30:20] which we have done
[1:30:22] but according to his Mercy he saved us
[1:30:24] by the washing of regeneration this is
[1:30:27] the new birth
[1:30:29] by the washing of regeneration and
[1:30:31] renewing of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:34] not not by works of righteousness it's
[1:30:37] not the good deeds and the good things
[1:30:38] we've done that's not what did it but
[1:30:41] according to the mer his Mercy he saved
[1:30:44] us by the washing of regeneration you
[1:30:48] becoming a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:30:52] and by the renewal the Regeneration and
[1:30:55] new creature by becoming a new creature
[1:30:58] of the Holy Ghost that's how he saved us
[1:31:02] by the new birth
[1:31:04] Romans 5 he says but God commending his
[1:31:08] love towards us and that while we were
[1:31:09] yet sinners Christ died for us much more
[1:31:12] than being now justified by his blood we
[1:31:15] shall be saved from wrath through him
[1:31:17] for if if when we were enemies we were
[1:31:20] reconciled to God by the death of his
[1:31:22] son much more being reconciled we shall
[1:31:25] be saved by his life
[1:31:27] what life resurrected life
[1:31:29] where is his life
[1:31:31] it needs to be in me
[1:31:34] I need to be saved by his life amen
[1:31:37] reconciled by his blood reconciled by
[1:31:39] his death amen but saved by his life
[1:31:43] I need his life
[1:31:45] in me
[1:31:47] Christ is the mystery of God revealed he
[1:31:49] says look Christ in you makes him the
[1:31:50] center of the life of the revelation
[1:31:53] Christ's life in you makes him the
[1:31:56] sinner of the revelation
[1:31:58] Christ's life in you doesn't make you a
[1:32:00] puffed up arrogant religious
[1:32:03] but Christ's life in you makes him the
[1:32:05] center of the Revelation in you
[1:32:09] Christ life in you makes him the center
[1:32:11] of the Revelation Christ in the Bible
[1:32:12] makes the Bible the complete revelation
[1:32:14] of Christ Christ in you makes you the
[1:32:17] complete revelation of the whole thing
[1:32:19] see what God is trying to do
[1:32:22] what is the new birth then you said well
[1:32:24] brother banham what is the new birth it
[1:32:26] is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:32:28] personally to you
[1:32:30] amen not you joined the church you shook
[1:32:32] a hand you've done something different
[1:32:33] you said a Creed you promised to live a
[1:32:35] code of rules
[1:32:36] but Christ the Bible he is the word that
[1:32:39] was revealed to you and no matter what
[1:32:40] anybody says what takes place it's
[1:32:42] Christ Pastor priest whatever it might
[1:32:44] be it's Christ in you that is the
[1:32:46] Revelation that the church was built
[1:32:48] upon
[1:32:50] and that is receiving the faith of Jesus
[1:32:53] Christ
[1:32:54] his life in me
[1:32:57] the message thirsty says we always
[1:33:00] say today people try to say we compare
[1:33:03] we've got to compare Bible leaf with
[1:33:04] Bible Leaf I read this a few weeks ago
[1:33:06] as well scripture with scripture that
[1:33:08] isn't the truth
[1:33:10] no it isn't the truth this Greek word
[1:33:13] means this this means that the Greeks
[1:33:15] themselves way back in the 90s Council
[1:33:17] and Dem Riders back in there they had
[1:33:18] different forms one believed this way
[1:33:20] this Greek scholar meant this and the
[1:33:22] other one said this one meant this way
[1:33:24] and they fussed over him we don't need
[1:33:26] interpretation of Greek Scholars or
[1:33:28] Greek words to know him as life
[1:33:32] we're saved by his life amen we're
[1:33:34] renewed and regenerated by the Holy
[1:33:36] Ghost
[1:33:37] to know him as life the person Christ
[1:33:40] himself not comparing it's a revelation
[1:33:43] that God built his church upon
[1:33:45] and if if we don't build upon that same
[1:33:48] church the Bible said Abel by faith and
[1:33:53] faith is a divine revelation see faith
[1:33:55] is a divine revelation all right this
[1:33:57] whole thing is built upon the Revelation
[1:33:59] then unless this is revealed to you
[1:34:01] Jesus said I thank the father that thou
[1:34:04] has hid these things from the wives of
[1:34:05] the world and revealed it to babes such
[1:34:07] as we'll learn
[1:34:08] see now the whole thing is built there
[1:34:10] you've got to know the person
[1:34:13] and you cannot satisfy that by joining
[1:34:16] Church
[1:34:17] you've got to find the person God
[1:34:19] himself which is the word
[1:34:21] and interpretation of himself today
[1:34:25] the promise that he made today
[1:34:28] listen brother Branham never remember he
[1:34:32] doesn't leave it in the past
[1:34:35] he brings Christ present tense
[1:34:38] he brings Christ on the scene today
[1:34:39] because he is the anointed word today
[1:34:43] amen and so now we must meet the person
[1:34:46] of the word which is present today not
[1:34:49] where he was but where he is because the
[1:34:51] light was there
[1:34:53] but now the light is here
[1:34:56] and we must meet him in the light and
[1:34:58] walk in the light of our day
[1:35:01] and we need to meet a living Jesus
[1:35:03] Christ present today amen the historical
[1:35:06] Christ is the one who made it possible
[1:35:08] to meet him today
[1:35:09] what he did in the past he's still the
[1:35:12] same if you get Christ you get all that
[1:35:14] he ever was you get the law you get the
[1:35:16] prophets you get everything you get
[1:35:18] Calvary you get it all
[1:35:20] because it's all in him
[1:35:24] remember we said before if I if I want
[1:35:27] what he did previously believe that but
[1:35:29] reject what he did today I'm cutting
[1:35:31] myself off
[1:35:36] you cannot satisfy this by joining a
[1:35:40] church
[1:35:41] coming to the right church with the
[1:35:43] right Doctrine and believing the right
[1:35:45] thing and having a belief of the right
[1:35:47] thing amen that's not enough you must
[1:35:49] meet him personally the Christ of today
[1:35:53] what is a new birth Jesus Christ
[1:35:55] revealed to you personally
[1:35:57] not to a group
[1:35:59] not we all got it but I met this Christ
[1:36:03] that the prophet's talking about
[1:36:06] I came in contact with the current life
[1:36:09] present tense true life and it came and
[1:36:11] it lit something in me and it came to
[1:36:13] life
[1:36:14] and now the life I live I live in the
[1:36:18] flesh by the faith of the son of God
[1:36:21] now all that he ordained for me to do I
[1:36:24] will do and I think this beats legalism
[1:36:27] by a million miles amen because now
[1:36:29] there's nothing that I have to do
[1:36:31] everything is what I want to do my whole
[1:36:33] desires and nature has changed under a
[1:36:36] new birth
[1:36:38] amen
[1:36:40] I mean it's it it doesn't matter
[1:36:45] it doesn't matter that the the the say
[1:36:50] it this way that the farmer took an
[1:36:52] eagle egg and hatched it under a chicken
[1:36:54] that didn't make it a chicken
[1:37:00] whatever the nature in the seed was is
[1:37:03] what it is
[1:37:05] that makes sense
[1:37:07] so he tried to be a chicken but he was a
[1:37:10] lousy chicken
[1:37:12] he was a failure as a chicken
[1:37:15] but when he heard the eagle scream it
[1:37:17] woke up what he was on the inside and
[1:37:20] brought him to himself and brought him
[1:37:22] alive to the fact that he was an eagle
[1:37:25] not a chicken
[1:37:28] right and he flew away
[1:37:32] listen the new birth reveals what God
[1:37:35] always intended for us to be
[1:37:37] but we were born under the wrong nature
[1:37:39] and that nature has to die amen and
[1:37:42] there has to be a regeneration a newness
[1:37:44] of Life a new creation amen and that
[1:37:46] seed that God had predestinated in Us by
[1:37:49] the quickening power of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:50] has got to come to life and whatever
[1:37:52] that seed is is what we will live
[1:37:56] if it's never been quickened we'll still
[1:37:58] live some sort of hybrid life
[1:38:00] trying to be a Christian trying to do
[1:38:03] this but not
[1:38:05] but when it comes to life it just begins
[1:38:07] to live its own life
[1:38:10] and and every creature lives what's in
[1:38:12] the seed
[1:38:14] Every Creature lives what's in the seed
[1:38:16] and so now it produces that life
[1:38:20] that new birth
[1:38:22] when it when when the seed is quickened
[1:38:25] you're a new creature in Christ now that
[1:38:28] seed takes over and begins to live
[1:38:31] and now it doesn't smoke because it
[1:38:34] doesn't want to smoke
[1:38:37] not because it's not allowed to smoke
[1:38:41] it doesn't look after a woman to lust
[1:38:43] after her not because it's not allowed
[1:38:46] but because it doesn't want to
[1:38:49] and even if the flesh has Cravings or
[1:38:52] Temptations the desire in the heart
[1:38:54] doesn't want it and pulls the flesh back
[1:38:56] in line with the desire of the heart
[1:38:59] because the Nature has changed the seed
[1:39:02] has been quickened the life is in there
[1:39:04] and now we don't have to we don't have
[1:39:07] to keep ordinances to be righteous we've
[1:39:09] been declared righteous and now we have
[1:39:10] the freedom to live the life of the seed
[1:39:13] which is the word which will live the
[1:39:16] word which will manifest the word
[1:39:19] and
[1:39:20] it's not so difficult
[1:39:24] as living legalistic
[1:39:26] living legalistic is horrible
[1:39:29] terrible
[1:39:31] it's bondage
[1:39:32] there's no Liberty you have to do this
[1:39:35] you have to do that you have to do this
[1:39:37] and all it does is create inner tension
[1:39:39] in turmoil
[1:39:41] but a new birth is absolute freedom
[1:39:43] because then the ego just learns how to
[1:39:45] Flap
[1:39:46] learns how to catch a breeze and learns
[1:39:48] how to fly and it is not flying is as
[1:39:50] natural for an eagle as as anything
[1:39:52] because it was born to fly and living a
[1:39:55] Christian Life is a natural for a Son of
[1:39:57] God as flying as for an eagle because
[1:39:59] you were born to live the life
[1:40:02] your newborn birth releases you from the
[1:40:05] bondage of sin amen into the newness of
[1:40:07] life to be what you were always intended
[1:40:09] to be and now all you got to do is
[1:40:11] stretch your wings a little bit and fly
[1:40:13] and now living a Christian Life is
[1:40:16] natural to the life on the sea in the
[1:40:17] seed
[1:40:19] praise God
[1:40:21] so in this quote president said the
[1:40:23] whole church is based on Revelation
[1:40:26] Revelation Revelation amen not mental
[1:40:29] agreement but Revelation quickened to
[1:40:31] you personally
[1:40:33] and this is the scripture that goes to
[1:40:34] in Matthew 16.
[1:40:36] when Jesus came into the coast of
[1:40:38] caesarea Philippi
[1:40:40] he asked his disciples saying whom do
[1:40:43] men say that I the son of man am and
[1:40:45] they said some say that thou art John
[1:40:46] the Baptist some Elias others Jeremiahs
[1:40:49] are one of the prophets he saith unto
[1:40:51] them but whom say ye that I am and Simon
[1:40:54] Peter answered and said Thou Art the
[1:40:55] Christ the son of the Living God
[1:40:57] and Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:40:59] blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh
[1:41:02] and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee
[1:41:03] but my Father which is in heaven and I
[1:41:07] say also unto thee that thou art Peter
[1:41:08] and Upon This Rock I will build my
[1:41:10] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[1:41:13] Prevail against it
[1:41:16] why will the gates of hell not Prevail
[1:41:18] against the church because the church is
[1:41:19] on the foundational Rock of the
[1:41:22] revelation of who Jesus Christ is
[1:41:25] and guess what
[1:41:27] he's present
[1:41:29] I'll say it this way he is
[1:41:34] he is
[1:41:36] now
[1:41:38] flesh and blood cannot reveal this to
[1:41:41] you
[1:41:42] but the Father which is in heaven can
[1:41:43] reveal to you who he is
[1:41:49] not just was
[1:41:52] who he is
[1:41:54] this is the foundation that the church
[1:41:56] is built on the revelation of who he is
[1:42:02] and with that Foundation
[1:42:04] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[1:42:07] the church
[1:42:11] visible union says but still you claim
[1:42:13] to be very religious so was Cain
[1:42:16] The Prostitute is some very religious
[1:42:18] build altars offered sacrifices paid his
[1:42:21] tithes done everything that any other
[1:42:22] religious man would do but he failed to
[1:42:25] keep that word he failed to have the
[1:42:28] revelation
[1:42:29] he was good in so many ways he was wrong
[1:42:32] in one he didn't catch the revelation
[1:42:36] then after that
[1:42:37] he turned against his brother
[1:42:40] and the Revelation is the only thing the
[1:42:42] revelation of the word what is a
[1:42:44] revelation Jesus said Upon This Rock
[1:42:45] I'll build my church and the gates of
[1:42:47] hell can't Prevail against it faith is a
[1:42:49] revelation because faith has been
[1:42:51] revealed to you
[1:42:53] Abel by faith offered by Revelation
[1:42:57] Faith offered to God a more excellent
[1:43:00] sacrifice than that of Cain
[1:43:03] Able by Faith by what Revelation so what
[1:43:07] is this faith that we're saved by and
[1:43:09] justified by what is this Faith it's a
[1:43:12] revelation
[1:43:13] the same thing the church was founded
[1:43:15] upon and still founded upon amen is a
[1:43:18] revelation that is faith
[1:43:23] it doesn't
[1:43:25] praise God
[1:43:26] it takes a revelation to believe a
[1:43:29] present tense I am God
[1:43:33] it doesn't take a lot of Revelation to
[1:43:35] believe what the whole world believes
[1:43:37] historically took place
[1:43:39] but it takes Revelation to believe in a
[1:43:42] present tense I am gone
[1:43:45] and that Revelation is Faith the faith
[1:43:49] that gives us access by Grace Amen to be
[1:43:52] justified and to be declared righteous
[1:43:57] Hebrews 11 by faith Abel offered unto
[1:44:01] God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain
[1:44:02] by which he obtained witness that he was
[1:44:05] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[1:44:08] and by it him being dead yet speaketh
[1:44:11] amen he offered a more excellent
[1:44:12] sacrifice because his sacrifice was
[1:44:15] according to his revelation
[1:44:17] he realized that it was blood that got
[1:44:19] him out of the garden and it's going to
[1:44:20] take blood amen and that God offered a
[1:44:22] lamb and he offered a lamb his
[1:44:24] Revelation was manifest in his works
[1:44:27] and by it they witnessed his Works
[1:44:30] witnessed that he was righteous
[1:44:32] amen this is before the law
[1:44:35] before the law God had righteous
[1:44:39] servants
[1:44:41] Abel was righteous Abraham was righteous
[1:44:44] the question is how were they righteous
[1:44:46] they were righteous by faith
[1:44:49] before the law the children of God were
[1:44:51] declared righteous by faith because they
[1:44:53] believed God
[1:44:55] Abel believed God
[1:44:57] Abraham believed God they didn't believe
[1:44:59] the same part
[1:45:02] does that make sense
[1:45:04] they believed the present tense God the
[1:45:06] I am God The God Who was coming to them
[1:45:08] by Revelation and giving them the word
[1:45:10] for their day and when Abel received the
[1:45:13] Revelation for his day he was declared
[1:45:15] he witnessed that he was righteous
[1:45:18] when Abraham received the the
[1:45:20] instructions from God the word of God
[1:45:21] for his day it was imputed unto him for
[1:45:24] righteousness
[1:45:26] praise God
[1:45:27] then the law comes and then all the
[1:45:30] Deeds started amen but before the law
[1:45:32] remember the law came as a failure of
[1:45:35] Israel to keep the word of God and come
[1:45:37] up into the mountain and exodus to come
[1:45:40] to Sinai they ran away and brother bam
[1:45:42] said that's where they made their fatal
[1:45:44] mistake in Exodus 19 they chose law over
[1:45:47] Grace God wasn't going to give them the
[1:45:49] law he was going to give them Grace all
[1:45:51] he was going to give them was the Ten
[1:45:52] Commandments and that was it
[1:45:55] the book of ordinances and all the laws
[1:45:57] and the rituals it came after they
[1:45:59] turned from God and sent Moses up
[1:46:02] God was going to deal with them with
[1:46:03] Grace where they would receive a
[1:46:05] revelation of the word and when they and
[1:46:07] that Revelation as they believed it
[1:46:10] would be imputed unto them for
[1:46:11] righteousness
[1:46:12] that's how it was before
[1:46:15] but now that the law was fulfilled in
[1:46:17] Christ and he became the ultimate
[1:46:19] sacrifice freeing us from the bondage of
[1:46:21] the law it has gone right back to what
[1:46:23] it was before now it's righteousness by
[1:46:25] Faith by a revelation in your God in
[1:46:29] your day in Jesus Christ today
[1:46:33] you see how the message opens the whole
[1:46:36] Bible
[1:46:37] things that are fundamental to
[1:46:39] Christianity they've been absolutely
[1:46:41] lost they've been they've been they've
[1:46:43] been hijacked amen and they they've made
[1:46:46] it repeat after me prayers repeat after
[1:46:48] me I believe Jesus died for me on a
[1:46:50] cross 2000 years ago and and they're
[1:46:53] repeating this and they're acknowledging
[1:46:54] what happened amen and and declaring
[1:46:57] people to be righteous and to be
[1:46:58] justified but my goodness the Revelation
[1:47:01] from the Bible is everybody who had
[1:47:03] imputed righteousness who was declared
[1:47:05] righteous or witnessed to be righteous
[1:47:06] were people who believe the god of their
[1:47:09] day
[1:47:10] the I am present tense God and the Bible
[1:47:13] so opens up the Revelation the truth of
[1:47:17] justification the truth of righteousness
[1:47:21] and the message has taken us back to the
[1:47:24] realities
[1:47:25] of these things
[1:47:28] now listen I hope you don't
[1:47:29] misunderstand me either somebody with an
[1:47:32] honest and sincere heart who is blinded
[1:47:34] to the message and all they can do is
[1:47:36] believe in historical God and stay true
[1:47:38] to that I believe they'll receive a
[1:47:39] reward for that I'm happy for that
[1:47:43] but but that doesn't put them in the
[1:47:46] place the elector in by the imputation
[1:47:48] of righteous declared just by faith
[1:47:53] it's different but I say if they have no
[1:47:57] capacity to see anymore let them live
[1:47:59] all that they see
[1:48:02] and praise God at the white Throne
[1:48:05] judgment interest to life can be granted
[1:48:08] and I want it for all
[1:48:10] but for the bride
[1:48:12] God is declaring us righteous now
[1:48:15] we've passed condemnation there is no
[1:48:17] judgment for the bride because by
[1:48:19] Revelation she has been declared just
[1:48:22] and righteous
[1:48:25] praise God and can we be proud about
[1:48:27] that revelation
[1:48:29] no you couldn't receive it unless there
[1:48:31] was a seed of eternal life inside
[1:48:34] but what a consolation the word brings
[1:48:37] us
[1:48:39] just want to read two three more things
[1:48:40] now Faith is a revelation from God now
[1:48:43] Faith is a revelation that's where I
[1:48:45] want to say just a moment it's a
[1:48:46] revelation he has revealed to you by his
[1:48:48] grace
[1:48:49] it's nothing you did you didn't work
[1:48:52] yourself up into faith
[1:48:55] you ever have faith it's given to you by
[1:48:57] the grace of God and God reveals it to
[1:48:59] you therefore faith is a revelation and
[1:49:02] the whole Church of God is a built upon
[1:49:05] the revelation
[1:49:07] Hey listen you can't say I'm trying to
[1:49:09] have faith I'm trying to have faith you
[1:49:10] can't try to have faith
[1:49:13] brother man said faith is subconscious
[1:49:15] you've got it you don't even know it
[1:49:16] because faith is in you
[1:49:18] amen amen it doesn't mean you don't
[1:49:21] exercise your faith brother man said
[1:49:23] that's human Faith it's Acorn Faith hold
[1:49:24] on to it until it grows into real actual
[1:49:26] Faith perfect Faith amen but but you
[1:49:29] can't just press yourself in the faith
[1:49:31] faith is sovereignly given it's the
[1:49:33] grace of God
[1:49:35] I thank God for that
[1:49:38] amen
[1:49:41] I'm not going to go into this one
[1:49:43] I'm gonna skip it
[1:49:46] John 6 says no man can come to me except
[1:49:49] the Father which has sent me draw him
[1:49:51] and I will raise him up at the last day
[1:49:53] it is written in the prophets and they
[1:49:56] shall be all taught of God every man
[1:49:58] therefore that hath heard and hath
[1:50:00] learned of the father cometh unto me
[1:50:04] it's a really interesting scripture
[1:50:07] the question is
[1:50:09] where is he
[1:50:12] where is he
[1:50:14] I said he is earlier is Christ present
[1:50:18] tense
[1:50:20] is he here
[1:50:23] so in order to come to him the father
[1:50:26] must draw you to him to where he is
[1:50:31] presently
[1:50:32] where he is
[1:50:34] under the revelation of the hour under
[1:50:36] the manifestation of Christ in your day
[1:50:37] if he's drawing he's drawing to where he
[1:50:41] is
[1:50:43] and this is what he says in the
[1:50:45] scripture
[1:50:46] every man therefore that hath heard
[1:50:50] before
[1:50:52] and hath learned of the father cometh
[1:50:55] unto me
[1:50:56] not after you learn of the father do you
[1:50:59] come to him but you learned before the
[1:51:01] question is where did you learn before
[1:51:04] when you were in the mind of God Amen
[1:51:06] there's a seed inside of you a gene of
[1:51:08] God that was there
[1:51:10] that knew the Plan of Salvation amen
[1:51:12] that had it revealed when you were in
[1:51:14] attribute form and that attribute now is
[1:51:17] alive in you something in you heard from
[1:51:19] the father and was taught from the
[1:51:20] father and can can come alive at the
[1:51:23] present tense word and say that's the
[1:51:25] truth
[1:51:26] amen I've heard that before
[1:51:29] you ever heard of preaching or brother
[1:51:31] bam say something or somebody bring out
[1:51:32] a scripture or quote and you know you
[1:51:35] never heard it before but something in
[1:51:37] you heard it before
[1:51:38] it had a familiar sound it had that real
[1:51:41] ring and you said that ain't nothing but
[1:51:43] the truth amen how did you know it
[1:51:45] wasn't nothing but the truth you never
[1:51:46] heard it before
[1:51:48] how did you go verify the facts did you
[1:51:50] go back 2 000 years ago did you go into
[1:51:52] that little room where Hattie Wright was
[1:51:54] Hattie Wright wasn't where the squirrels
[1:51:55] were but something in her knew that that
[1:51:57] was the truth
[1:51:59] because she had heard from the father
[1:52:01] before and been taught with the father
[1:52:02] before
[1:52:04] amen and there's things that we can't
[1:52:06] prove we can't get the evidence we can't
[1:52:07] go get the facts we don't need them the
[1:52:10] evidence is inside amen not external
[1:52:12] inside
[1:52:14] and it's by revelation of present tense
[1:52:17] truth that God brings us to Faith where
[1:52:19] we can apprehend by Grace Amen to
[1:52:22] justification and righteousness that God
[1:52:24] is imputing unto us
[1:52:26] and I say thank you God it's nothing I
[1:52:28] did but I believe it with all of my
[1:52:30] heart I can't not believe it
[1:52:34] I I can no more disbelieve this than
[1:52:37] than anything else amen no more
[1:52:39] disbelieve it than a fish can just
[1:52:41] believe it's a fish I mean you are what
[1:52:42] you are you can't help it I don't
[1:52:45] believe because I'm trying I'm not
[1:52:46] trying to believe amen I believe I Can't
[1:52:49] Help Believing
[1:52:53] when I first came to the message I
[1:52:55] believed in spite of the difficulty
[1:52:59] I believed when it was inconvenient to
[1:53:02] believe
[1:53:03] and difficult and painful and hurtful
[1:53:06] and I still believed
[1:53:09] praise God
[1:53:11] amen let's finish up
[1:53:15] and we read over there in Saint John 5
[1:53:16] 24 he that heareth my word now the real
[1:53:19] translation is that not he the heareth
[1:53:21] that's the King James the real
[1:53:23] translation in the Hebrew is this he
[1:53:25] that receiveth my word
[1:53:27] not he that heareth anybody can hear it
[1:53:29] Sinners everybody else but he that
[1:53:31] receiveth can take it all not he
[1:53:34] received one of my words he that
[1:53:37] receiveth my word and believeth on him
[1:53:38] that sent me when you receive the word
[1:53:41] you receive him
[1:53:43] everything he said that you are willing
[1:53:46] and happy to do he that receives my word
[1:53:48] and believes on him that sent me has
[1:53:50] eternal life and shall not go through
[1:53:52] the Judgment but has passed from death
[1:53:54] into life oh what a promise
[1:53:59] and if we walk in the light
[1:54:02] as he is in the light that would be the
[1:54:06] light that's shining today
[1:54:08] that's the light we have to walk in if
[1:54:10] we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:54:12] light we have fellowship with one
[1:54:14] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:54:16] his son cleanses us from all
[1:54:19] sin
[1:54:22] I wrote down here musicians if you can
[1:54:24] come please brother John if you'll make
[1:54:26] your way up
[1:54:28] Christ's death
[1:54:30] freed us from the bondage of sin
[1:54:34] faith in Christ today
[1:54:37] links us to what he did for us at
[1:54:39] Calvary
[1:54:42] I can't walk back there and stand there
[1:54:44] at the cross and say I believe this
[1:54:48] right I wasn't alive then
[1:54:50] but when I receive him now
[1:54:53] he's the same one who died for me
[1:54:57] remember brother Ben said the word bled
[1:54:59] for you the word died for you what was
[1:55:02] nailed to the cross the word made flesh
[1:55:04] what was bleeding the word made flesh
[1:55:07] amen what what was that that was the
[1:55:10] word the word was nailed to the cross
[1:55:12] the word bled for me the word died for
[1:55:15] me
[1:55:16] so now if I want the I if I want the
[1:55:19] effect of Calvary I must come to the
[1:55:22] word in the present day word already
[1:55:25] bled for me when it was in flesh form
[1:55:28] and when I received this word that life
[1:55:32] from the word which was released at
[1:55:34] Calvary which was the Life of Christ the
[1:55:36] life of that word can come into me amen
[1:55:38] is my atonement showing me that the
[1:55:40] blood was shed for me
[1:55:43] that I'm part of that I was purchased
[1:55:45] under that shedding of the blood
[1:55:47] amen and so now the word that I received
[1:55:50] today is the same word it's part of the
[1:55:53] same word that bled for me at Calvary
[1:55:55] same Jesus Christ same one he's here now
[1:56:00] and I want to say Lord
[1:56:02] I believe you
[1:56:03] not because I'm smart
[1:56:06] not because I'm religious
[1:56:08] I believe you because something in me
[1:56:11] believes you
[1:56:12] because you've made me to believe you
[1:56:15] you've caused me to believe you've drawn
[1:56:18] me because I heard you before and was
[1:56:19] taught by you
[1:56:21] somehow you have drawn me and unlocked
[1:56:24] something in me to believe and I know
[1:56:26] that that's by grace
[1:56:29] and I say thank you Lord for this
[1:56:31] Revelation that's the faith I need
[1:56:34] to be declared just
[1:56:36] and righteous
[1:56:38] and let's all stand
[1:56:40] oh I just thank God for his word
[1:56:44] thank God
[1:56:47] we are not the bride is not righteous
[1:56:49] because she knows how to dress
[1:56:53] we got to get that notion out of our
[1:56:55] heads
[1:56:56] the bride's not righteous because she
[1:56:58] knows how to dress and she knows the
[1:57:00] truth about marriage and divorce and
[1:57:01] she's not getting caught up in that and
[1:57:03] she knows about morality has been
[1:57:05] restored to the church that's not what
[1:57:07] makes her righteous
[1:57:10] what makes her righteous is that she
[1:57:12] believes
[1:57:14] and it's imputed under her for
[1:57:15] righteousness
[1:57:16] how does she believe because God put it
[1:57:20] in her to believe
[1:57:23] not righteous because we look like
[1:57:25] Christians and talk like Christians and
[1:57:27] act like Christians that's not what made
[1:57:28] us righteous
[1:57:30] he made us righteous but we look like
[1:57:33] Christians and talk like Christians and
[1:57:34] act like Christians because we are
[1:57:36] Christians
[1:57:38] because Christ dwells within us
[1:57:42] we have compassion on people we uphold
[1:57:44] the word we line up to the word
[1:57:46] continually because we are Christians
[1:57:49] because Christ lives inside
[1:57:53] it's that simple
[1:57:54] I'm thankful
[1:57:56] I could have never lived this life I
[1:57:59] tried to be a good Pentecostal boy and I
[1:58:01] really tried
[1:58:02] and I failed and I failed and I failed
[1:58:06] and I failed I tried I knew it was right
[1:58:09] and wrong I knew what God wanted I knew
[1:58:11] what the Bible said on certain things
[1:58:13] and I failed and I failed and I failed
[1:58:15] but by the grace of God he quickened
[1:58:17] something inside of me and it's not the
[1:58:19] life I live anymore it's a life he comes
[1:58:21] inside and lives through me
[1:58:24] and now so many things have left so many
[1:58:26] desires so many things are gone amen and
[1:58:29] it's not even that I willed them to go
[1:58:30] away they just left amen and as I keep
[1:58:33] growing more desires change and more
[1:58:36] things fall off and it's the grace of
[1:58:38] God
[1:58:40] as the tree grows it just puts out more
[1:58:43] fruit
[1:58:44] and what where is the Life coming from
[1:58:45] it's coming from the root
[1:58:48] I thank God for that
[1:58:49] man let's bow our heads and pray
[1:58:51] together
[1:58:52] dear Lord Jesus we thank you for this
[1:58:54] word
[1:58:55] God I pray Lord that it would strike us
[1:58:58] Lord
[1:58:59] maybe in a deeper way or a clearer
[1:59:02] understanding that we would understand
[1:59:04] how great your grace is
[1:59:07] what a wonderful thing you've done for
[1:59:09] us in the day that we live in
[1:59:11] for Lord you have given us a revelation
[1:59:13] of yourself
[1:59:16] and before you ever revealed yourself in
[1:59:18] this end time
[1:59:19] you saw that we would be here with your
[1:59:22] seed inside of us
[1:59:24] you knew it
[1:59:26] and Lord you knew how to move us in
[1:59:28] position to come in contact with that
[1:59:30] life
[1:59:31] and you knew when the light struck the
[1:59:33] seed it would come to life
[1:59:35] so Lord you watched over our lives and
[1:59:37] you made sure at the right time
[1:59:40] we came in contact
[1:59:42] and Lord there was a life laying in the
[1:59:44] seed that needed that sun
[1:59:46] it was a germanized seed it needed to be
[1:59:49] quickened
[1:59:50] you knew when the water fell under the
[1:59:52] light hit it that it would come to life
[1:59:54] and that it would produce your life its
[1:59:57] own life
[1:59:59] God we're so thankful
[2:00:01] when we look back of our Lives we would
[2:00:03] have ruined our lives we would have
[2:00:05] fallen a thousand times over
[2:00:07] we would have gone the wrong direction
[2:00:09] and every choice we made we would have
[2:00:11] done it all wrong if you hadn't already
[2:00:13] had a plan
[2:00:15] well we just want to say thank you
[2:00:18] that you gave such a word in such a way
[2:00:21] just like when you were here
[2:00:23] thousands hundreds of thousands maybe
[2:00:25] millions could not receive you but there
[2:00:28] was a few who could
[2:00:30] the little woman at the well the Harley
[2:00:32] who washed your feet the publican
[2:00:35] the fishermen they had something in them
[2:00:38] that they could express a faith that
[2:00:39] believes you
[2:00:41] and God we're just like those
[2:00:43] individuals in a world where Millions
[2:00:45] maybe billions will disbelieve
[2:00:48] there's something in us will say We
[2:00:50] Believe
[2:00:51] that this message is Christ
[2:00:53] this word that's been restored as you
[2:00:56] Lord you're here you're present you're
[2:00:57] dwelling in your bride
[2:01:00] we see your manifestation in the end
[2:01:02] time in the formation of your bride and
[2:01:04] we receive it and we accept it Lord
[2:01:07] thank you
[2:01:09] for giving us that kind of faith
[2:01:12] thank you Lord
[2:01:13] for giving us Grace
[2:01:15] by your righteousness by your Justice

[2:01:20] because we believe your word
[2:01:23] I'll go with your people bless us as we
[2:01:26] go help us to stay rooted and grounded
[2:01:28] in the revelation of the truth that's
[2:01:30] been restored may we never waver or
[2:01:33] falter or have self-doubt Lord may you
[2:01:35] help us to stay established on these
[2:01:37] truths
[2:01:38] may they give us confidence to continue
[2:01:41] marching forward and boldly proclaiming
[2:01:44] Lord your life in this world
[2:01:47] we give you our lives and ask that you
[2:01:49] would take control in Jesus Christ's
[2:01:51] name we pray
[2:01:52] amen
[2:01:54] amen bless you brother John
