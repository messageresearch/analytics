[13:54] to God and honors him and lifts him up

[14:19] cometh himself unless the father draws

[15:01] to visit he's been a friend of many for
[15:04] a long time and we've known him
[15:06] watched him grow up through his teenage
[15:08] years his young adult life as God used
[15:10] him as a translator and then gifted him
[15:13] he studied hard but God gifted him and
[15:15] gave him the ability to translate and
[15:17] he's translated much of the message into
[15:20] the Russian language and also summoned
[15:22] the Lithuanian language and then God
[15:24] called him the minister while he was
[15:25] still young and he's ministered for many
[15:27] years and now he's pastoring a
[15:30] fellowship there and that's been just a

[23:00] it possible too
[23:01] for us to come it is very refreshing you
[23:05] know it is you know the best the best
[23:08] sightseeing for us is the is the city of
[23:10] the Living God you know so so when you
[23:12] go through the alleys and the you know
[23:14] the golden streets you know you you just
[23:17] visit with the Saints we've been able to
[23:19] you know visit some of you here we just
[23:21] have a few short days here but uh it's
[23:24] been so good you know it's been so
[23:26] refreshing it's such a it's such a bomb
[23:28] and Gilead you know when you when you go
[23:30] and you visit the uh the streets of gold
[23:34] that you haven't been before I believe
[23:37] you know the city is is the people you
[23:39] know so so when you go and when you
[23:42] haven't touched you know we see the
[23:43] glory of this great City and uh you know
[23:46] we'll we'll bring some of those
[23:48] testimonies back home and to say oh the
[23:51] city is wonderful the city is is
[23:53] beautiful it's worth seeing you know so
[23:55] so we appreciate you all uh today and to
[23:59] see some good old friends here you know
[24:02] that's you know and now our kids have
[24:05] grown up you know and you you know time
[24:08] is flying but one thing is becoming
[24:12] stronger is uh is our bond with Jesus
[24:16] Christ our bond with the word and also
[24:18] our bonds with one another
[24:20] this is what I believe is going to be
[24:23] stronger with as as this glorious
[24:26] Rapture is coming closer
[24:29] so uh this morning I would just want to
[24:32] take a very short and you know simple uh
[24:36] thought I believe God is simple so it
[24:39] can reach the hearts you know and I just
[24:42] want to read a few scriptures with you
[24:44] that's Mark 4 33 34.
[24:48] and Luke 13
[24:50] 20-21 so if you can stand with me and uh
[24:54] and on the word
[24:55] uh we'll read from Mark 4 33
[25:00] first
[25:10] and it says and with many such Parables
[25:12] spake he the word unto them as they were
[25:15] able
[25:16] to hear it but without a parable
[25:19] speaking not unto them and when they
[25:21] were alone he expounded all things to
[25:25] his disciples
[25:27] praise the Lord and Luke 13 20 21 that's
[25:32] the main scripture and we want to focus
[25:33] on the Lord willing
[25:36] and it is one of The Parables one of the
[25:39] strange let's say one of the unusual
[25:43] Parables that Jesus told us and told his
[25:46] disciples Luke's 13 20.
[25:51] it says
[25:52] and again he said where unto shall I
[25:55] liken the kingdom of God
[25:58] and says it is like 11 which a woman
[26:01] took and hid in three measures of meal
[26:04] till the whole was leavened amen you can
[26:08] be seed it
[26:17] praise the Lord so this is Jesus
[26:20] speaking here and we understand that
[26:23] this was his style of his ministry you
[26:25] know wherever he would go he would speak
[26:27] in Parables he would use certain
[26:29] comparisons and you know the reason why
[26:33] he was doing this is actually mentioned
[26:35] here in the scriptures because he he was
[26:38] addressing him a particular
[26:40] um uh audience there his target audience
[26:44] was was his disciples but uh but then he
[26:46] was also speaking to everybody so uh now
[26:49] he he had to say it in a way that you
[26:53] know would be a sermon but then it would
[26:56] also be a mystery in a way because then
[26:59] uh his disciples would come uh
[27:01] separately and say what did that mean
[27:03] you know we we didn't really understand
[27:04] so he just like the scripture says in
[27:06] Mark he would expounded to them he would
[27:08] actually explain it to them and give the
[27:10] meanings of those things uh to his
[27:13] disciples and I believe we're his
[27:15] disciples too I mean his disciples are
[27:18] still here they are still on Earth
[27:19] because Jesus is still on Earth you know
[27:22] he's here his spirit is here his word is
[27:24] here so that that's the way in Jesus
[27:26] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[27:28] forever so if he did that yesterday he
[27:31] would do it today and he'll keep on
[27:33] doing it you know so so that's his style
[27:35] of ministry you know in in Matthew 13 He
[27:37] also says he who has ears to hear here
[27:41] uh let him hear
[27:43] and the disciples came and sent to him
[27:45] why speakers there are unto them in
[27:46] Parables and he answered and said unto
[27:49] them because it is given unto you
[27:53] to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[27:56] heaven but to them it is not given so uh
[28:00] the disciples were asking about them you
[28:02] know about the general public and
[28:03] they're saying why are you speaking to
[28:05] them in Parables he says because it's
[28:06] given unto you
[28:08] because I'm talking to you basically you
[28:10] know and and you are the ones you're the
[28:13] recipients you're the understanders
[28:14] you're the ones that this word is
[28:17] actually targeted at and he says it is
[28:19] given
[28:21] it has been given already
[28:23] right
[28:25] it's it's past tense I mean it's it's
[28:27] not that it will be given maybe it's it
[28:30] is predestination it is election you
[28:33] have a a a a a something in in heart in
[28:37] your heart that is able to receive that
[28:39] word
[28:40] it is given unto you to know to
[28:43] understand oh praise be to Jesus and he
[28:47] says why are you speaking in Parables
[28:49] and he says because it is given to you
[28:51] uh to know the Mysteries
[28:54] okay
[28:56] so so the meaning of the parable is a
[28:58] certain mystery there's something hidden
[29:00] in there
[29:01] it's something and you can't you cannot
[29:03] understand it unless it's given unto you
[29:05] and he says it is given unto you so you
[29:08] are sure to receive the mystery to
[29:10] understand the mystery to know the
[29:13] mysteries of what of kingdom of heaven
[29:16] but to them it's not given he says but
[29:18] it is given unto you I am I'm sure those
[29:21] disciples were happy you know they
[29:23] didn't understand but they were happy
[29:24] you know they were like oh praise the
[29:27] Lord you know it has given unto us so
[29:29] you know and in a certain way at a
[29:32] certain time this mystery will be
[29:34] revealed and it it is becoming clearer
[29:37] oh thank you Jesus so now when we when
[29:40] we go into
[29:43] uh you know the the ministry of Jesus
[29:46] there's you know plenty of them you
[29:47] probably even have counted and know how
[29:49] many parables in comparisons he has used
[29:51] in his uh in his ministry and uh you
[29:56] know there's many of them and many
[29:58] different types of them and these are
[30:01] all Mysteries these are this is
[30:03] something that is hidden in there and
[30:05] will be revealed to those that is given
[30:07] to right and I believe it's us I believe
[30:09] it's the Bride of Jesus Christ who will
[30:11] know what those Parables actually meant
[30:14] and brother Brandon when he goes into
[30:16] mistress and he says these are the if
[30:18] you remember the quote from seven
[30:20] churches it says these divinely revealed
[30:23] mystery truth
[30:25] have a purpose it's not just to
[30:27] Enlighten us it's not just to you know
[30:29] make us clever and to you know make us
[30:32] distinct from the others who don't you
[30:34] know really perceive those things it's
[30:36] actually they those mystery truths are
[30:38] amend to turn our hearts literally turn
[30:42] our hearts lift our faith up to the
[30:46] level of the Apostles to the level of
[30:48] the fathers praise the Lord so every
[30:50] time I read a parable every time you
[30:52] read the parable we are searching for a
[30:55] faith lift not for not for a facelift
[30:57] but for a faith lift in there something
[31:01] that would lift our faith up and say oh
[31:04] I believe it even more I Now understand
[31:06] the kingdom of God more and I understand
[31:08] the word more it is more revealed now to
[31:10] me than ever before praise the Lord even
[31:12] though these were just simple stories
[31:14] really simple stories and brother
[31:16] Branham had his parables you know the
[31:19] old fiddle the eagle story and you know
[31:22] the old Chevrolet and the engineer and
[31:24] you know the the man on the balcony the
[31:26] teacher you know and all of this these
[31:28] were actually The Parables of the son of
[31:30] man you know the modern ones the updated
[31:33] ones so every time we read that where
[31:35] our faith is lifted we understand oh I
[31:38] am the eaglet you know I I felt bad in
[31:40] this setting and now I'm I'm gonna you
[31:43] know fly high so praise the Lord just
[31:45] lifts our faith right thank you Jesus so
[31:48] so this is this is the meaning why he
[31:50] was actually in doing this the purpose
[31:52] was to lift our faith and to make us
[31:55] more believe more thank you Father so
[31:59] now every time you see Jesus standing
[32:01] there and he is you know the uh brother
[32:04] Brandon would say it depended on where
[32:07] he was you know speaking and this is
[32:10] where you know the type of parable would
[32:11] come out and he you know he was standing
[32:14] let's say before an audience of uh that
[32:17] was there in the agriculture Natural
[32:18] Area he would you he would mention the
[32:20] sower and the seed and and then he would
[32:23] go to the coast and speak to to them
[32:24] about fishing and and the net and all of
[32:27] these kind of things the reason was
[32:29] because he would understand that he is
[32:32] standing there and he was trying to
[32:34] explain to them things they've never
[32:36] seen before
[32:38] so how should he do that he would use
[32:41] their own concept their own understand
[32:43] their own uh uh language so to speak
[32:48] so that they would at least roughly have
[32:50] an idea because every time he would use
[32:52] the parable he would say it is like unto
[32:54] it's not exactly that it's not fully
[32:57] that you know you cannot it's a shadow
[32:59] it's a type it's it's a it's an example
[33:01] it's a metaphor it's a it's a comparison
[33:04] but it's not exactly that you know so so
[33:06] when uh when he was doing that it
[33:09] depended on what the audience actually
[33:11] was
[33:12] so that he and he was trying to relate
[33:14] that oh isn't that the way Jesus speaks
[33:17] to us today I mean he will always find a
[33:19] way to that is really close to our heart
[33:21] and somebody else does not understand
[33:23] that language but do you understand that
[33:25] language because you are that way
[33:27] if you're you know a man of nature you
[33:30] know you're in the woods you'll hear
[33:31] hear this bird chirp and you know you
[33:33] got you know an answer from the Lord
[33:36] and somebody else comes there there's a
[33:39] chirp and he's kind of nervous you know
[33:40] why is this bird chirping you know so
[33:42] and and he he's a you know and uh
[33:44] another type of man and maybe a
[33:46] scientific man he's just sitting there
[33:48] and Counting something he comes up with
[33:50] an eight and he says oh that's eternity
[33:52] I praise the Lord you know just like
[33:53] brother Brandon would say you know I I
[33:55] shot this deer there was like five
[33:57] streaks or you know uh something on one
[34:00] side and three on the other that's Grace
[34:02] and Perfection praise the Lord it was
[34:03] the God's will you know so it's like oh
[34:05] yeah so this is the way he he would be I
[34:07] wouldn't even count those things you
[34:09] know so but but he was that way you know
[34:12] so God has a language that he speaks to
[34:14] us and it's basically our language he
[34:16] drops down to our level to speak to us
[34:19] with the concepts that we really
[34:20] understand and that you know that
[34:23] because he needs to bring a message
[34:25] across
[34:26] so it would really be clear
[34:28] so who is now standing here and he you
[34:31] know we just read the parable on the
[34:33] before that he actually mentioned a
[34:35] parable of the mustard seed and he says
[34:37] and let's imagine who is actually
[34:39] standing there explaining those things
[34:42] to the people
[34:43] it's the word himself it's the one who
[34:47] is actually created the kingdom of God
[34:49] it's the kingdom of God in flesh
[34:52] standing there is the one who created
[34:54] the people and the one who created all
[34:57] those Dimensions that he's actually
[34:58] trying to describe to them so he's the
[35:01] main engineer right he's the doer he's
[35:03] the he's the CEO of of everything you
[35:06] know he's he's the Creator so he's
[35:08] standing there he created the people so
[35:10] just like he created you and he created
[35:13] all the worlds he created the kingdom of
[35:14] God oh he has a very nice and clear way
[35:18] to explain it to us right because he
[35:20] knows exactly he knows much better than
[35:22] anybody else what it's like
[35:25] and he knows much better uh than anybody
[35:29] else who when who would understand what
[35:33] because he's created you you know you
[35:35] you have your children and you know
[35:36] there's some you know you you probably
[35:39] maybe you they have some challenges of
[35:42] somebody explaining things to them and
[35:44] then they go to their mom and dad and
[35:45] mom and dad knows exactly you know what
[35:48] they their level of understanding is and
[35:50] they're like okay this is the oh okay it
[35:53] just rings the bell right away because
[35:56] they you you're close you know that's
[35:57] that's your child so so Jesus is
[36:00] standing there and he is the beginning
[36:03] of the creation of God you know and he
[36:06] is the logos and he is the one from the
[36:09] beginning he's seen it all when there
[36:11] was nothing he was there you know and he
[36:14] is standing now here and he's the best
[36:17] teacher he is the best explainer of
[36:19] those things
[36:21] Hallelujah
[36:23] thank you Jesus
[36:25] so now if we if we uh look at this this
[36:30] Parable that we've just read you know
[36:32] it's a it's an interesting one because
[36:35] um
[36:36] I couldn't understand it for years you
[36:39] know there's been the other Parables
[36:41] were clearer maybe but this this one was
[36:43] kind of a bit of a mystery for me so I
[36:45] was studying on it and and recently just
[36:48] touched or touched my heart and I
[36:50] started you know seeing certain things
[36:52] that I wanted to share that with you
[36:53] because it has been an encouragement for
[36:55] me I believe it can be for you too and
[36:58] he says and again he said
[37:00] where unto shall I liken the kingdom of
[37:04] God
[37:06] so if you read the context he was just
[37:08] sharing the Mustard Seed Parable before
[37:10] that and he's standing there and uh you
[37:14] can just imagine just draw a little
[37:15] drama here and you can imagine him
[37:17] standing there and uh he's trying to
[37:21] explain the kingdom of God to the people
[37:24] so so let's say maybe maybe that
[37:27] audience was uh was predominantly
[37:31] women sisters
[37:34] and uh
[37:36] he he's standing there and because the
[37:39] Bible actually says and again he said so
[37:41] he he was speaking and he he was trying
[37:44] to bring the message across and maybe he
[37:46] was seeing people are not catching it
[37:48] yet you know so he's like okay so how do
[37:52] how do I we're unto Chelan like in the
[37:55] king so what what's the other way of
[37:58] doing it how shall I you know what say
[38:00] other comparison or maybe you know we
[38:02] have many sisters and women here and
[38:04] they you know I've I've mentioned so
[38:07] many other Parables before like about
[38:09] the you know the male ones like about
[38:10] the solar about the fishermen and about
[38:12] the net and about you know the
[38:14] husbandmen and about this and that and
[38:16] there's still sister is here and he's
[38:18] like maybe standing there and thinking
[38:20] oh I wish you know I could you know find
[38:23] a way to explain it to them as well
[38:25] because you know sometimes the sisters
[38:28] will sit there and think okay those
[38:29] Brothers they they can catch things and
[38:31] how about me you know how about uh I
[38:34] don't feel like I really understand the
[38:36] those things so I believe it was
[38:38] something on that order of that order
[38:41] that that really motivated him to uh you
[38:45] know because every time it depended on
[38:46] the audience right it depends on on who
[38:50] was sitting there so he says well and
[38:53] again he says where under shall I liken
[38:55] the kingdom of God
[38:57] well so and then
[39:02] in in other words well if you if we put
[39:05] it in modern language how how how on
[39:08] Earth will I now reveal
[39:11] those seals
[39:13] to the sisters
[39:19] and uh because the sisters need to do to
[39:22] to to to to to understand it too
[39:26] you know and uh and maybe maybe Martha
[39:29] and Mary was there you know
[39:31] and they were asking Jesus would you
[39:33] maybe say something that really you know
[39:36] strikes our hearts because it looks like
[39:38] Lazarus is catching it but but you know
[39:41] we're you know
[39:43] this sister of mine is she was busy with
[39:46] the dishes and she didn't really catch
[39:48] that last time when I was sitting there
[39:50] at your feet and maybe I didn't really
[39:52] understand the sower part of it but yeah
[39:55] it was good but it just needs to ring a
[39:58] bell you know so
[39:59] so they were maybe maybe that was the
[40:02] the audience and maybe somebody similar
[40:04] to that and they really wanted to to
[40:07] grasp The Mystery of the Kingdom
[40:11] and the Mystery of the Kingdom for us it
[40:13] is the seventh seal because it's it is
[40:16] God
[40:17] it is it brings Christ to Earth
[40:21] right this is what brother Brian says
[40:23] what does it bring him for for for
[40:26] Kingdom
[40:28] he is the kingdom he brings the kingdom
[40:31] to the Earth right so so and in Luke 11
[40:35] that's two chapters before that he was
[40:37] teaching them to pray and they asked
[40:40] them how shall we pray now you know
[40:42] Jesus John's disciples they know how to
[40:43] pray and how about you and he is
[40:46] teaching them to pray about a kingdom he
[40:49] says thy kingdom come
[40:53] and maybe the sisters and even the
[40:55] brothers they would like on what kind of
[40:57] a kingdom is that
[40:59] why should we pray about it don't we
[41:01] have a kingdom here you know and and
[41:03] things like this so they may have
[41:05] different questions and so he is
[41:08] explaining to them what kind of kingdom
[41:10] is actually
[41:11] he is preaching about
[41:14] praise be to Jesus
[41:18] so I imagined him standing there and he
[41:21] would say and again where unto shall I
[41:24] look in the Kingdom oh I got an idea
[41:31] the kingdom of heaven
[41:34] is like 11. so he might have seen Martha
[41:38] and Mary you know while visiting how
[41:40] they were dealing with the dough and you
[41:42] know baking something and uh and he he
[41:45] probably thought oh that's a good way of
[41:47] explaining things to to the sisters and
[41:52] to those that know about Bakery and uh
[41:55] so he says it is like 11.
[41:57] which a woman took and hid in three
[42:01] measures of meal till the whole was
[42:05] leavened
[42:06] Hallelujah
[42:07] I mean this is just a short verse you
[42:09] know just you know one basically one
[42:12] verse one one story one short story but
[42:16] it it actually explains the whole
[42:17] kingdom of God
[42:19] from a certain perspective
[42:21] and it's strange you know the reason why
[42:24] I couldn't understand it for for years
[42:26] is because you know 11 is mainly
[42:29] negative you know in the in the Bible
[42:31] it's a negative comparison you take the
[42:32] leaven of the Pharisees and the
[42:34] Sadducees and the 11 of malice and all
[42:37] those you know that are mentioned in in
[42:39] the Bible but yet you know our our
[42:42] Prophet is so clear on things he says
[42:44] you know it it has you know compound
[42:46] meaning it may have both a positive and
[42:49] a negative you know uh meaning depending
[42:51] on context you know if you take
[42:53] different
[42:54] um types like you know we would say a
[42:55] goat you know every time you would think
[42:57] it's probably something really uh
[42:59] negative but who is this scapegoat it's
[43:02] Jesus Christ right and then you take a
[43:05] line you know he devil is like a little
[43:06] roaring line really aggressive but he's
[43:08] the line of Judah you know too so it
[43:10] goes both ways right thank you Jesus so
[43:14] this this 11 here it actually means
[43:17] something really positive when you when
[43:19] you when you look at that and so
[43:22] what is 11 I'm not a big expert on that
[43:25] but I've seen it work you know in in my
[43:29] wife's kitchen but uh you know it's it's
[43:32] it is something basically to just to
[43:35] give a short definition
[43:37] it is something that has a single
[43:41] cellular organisms that multiply quickly
[43:45] that multiply and replenish you know uh
[43:48] the dough but you know they this is
[43:51] there's a certain life inside of there
[43:55] there's an independent life
[43:57] in the leaven that can fill a certain
[44:00] space that can feel a certain matter
[44:02] over there right so so that this is you
[44:05] know this is the principle that Jesus is
[44:08] actually using and he wants us to
[44:10] understand that nothing will come right
[44:13] away and you will not be you know there
[44:16] uh you know fast it is a process
[44:21] but it is a guaranteed assured process
[44:25] where if it gets into there
[44:29] oh thank you Jesus it is working there
[44:34] there's a life inside over there there's
[44:36] a life that is not your life but it's
[44:38] his life inside of there
[44:40] so you remember brother Brian says you
[44:43] know the Holy Spirit when he enters into
[44:44] your life he's like a little button you
[44:46] know he's is this little size just like
[44:48] this little micro organism in fact in 11
[44:50] you don't even see it with your eyes
[44:52] it's not visible you gotta have a
[44:54] microscope or something to see how those
[44:56] bacteria or whatever you call them you
[44:58] know uh they they are spreading but it
[45:01] is there
[45:03] Hallelujah
[45:05] thank you Jesus and then brother Brian
[45:07] says it's it's a little ball of light
[45:09] you know and then it goes into a little
[45:10] golf ball or size or something like this
[45:13] and it goes for you know it grows and
[45:15] grows inside of you just like what just
[45:18] like 11.
[45:19] in the dough
[45:22] oh thank you Jesus Hallelujah so let's
[45:26] let's just look at you know this since
[45:29] there's only one verse we'll look at
[45:32] almost at almost every word in there
[45:34] because it's condensed you know it's
[45:37] like those little toys you know our
[45:39] children you know buying the story they
[45:41] buy a little something like this and
[45:43] they throw it in you know in a in a bowl
[45:45] of water and it grows you know just you
[45:47] got those here too
[45:49] yeah okay so so now if you if you look
[45:52] at that you know this every word there
[45:54] has has a meaning and you know one of
[45:58] the things that uh really caught my
[46:00] attention is that he speaks he actually
[46:04] speaks about a woman here
[46:07] it is a woman that took and hit those
[46:11] three measures of uh of uh
[46:14] in the three measures of meal and till
[46:17] the whole was uh 11. so it is a woman a
[46:22] woman is a church
[46:25] so it's a type of the church
[46:27] and this and this church
[46:30] it's not that it has the leaven it
[46:32] doesn't know how to to work with it she
[46:35] knows exactly what to do with leaven and
[46:38] the meal
[46:40] isn't that what brother Birmingham told
[46:42] us he says the word is in the bride
[46:45] and he says the mind of Christ insist
[46:47] and to know what he wants done with that
[46:51] word
[46:52] in other words he trusts and he gives
[46:54] this leaven into her hands and and he
[46:57] says now you're the one dealing with it
[47:00] now you're the one working with it
[47:03] it's not like oh praise the Lord God the
[47:06] leaven God got the leaven I got the Holy
[47:07] Ghost I got the Revelation that's fine
[47:09] and now you have to work with it
[47:13] and now you have to mingle it now you
[47:15] have to mix it into a reality
[47:19] oh thank you Jesus Hallelujah so so when
[47:24] we we look at that woman we look at that
[47:25] church we see that she actually goes
[47:28] through those three stages or three
[47:31] actions the three verbs mentioned there
[47:33] she took the leaven she hid it or mixed
[47:38] it with the dough with the meal and she
[47:42] had to wait until it's all done it's all
[47:46] leavened
[47:47] so all of these things this is what we
[47:50] we're going through every time God sends
[47:52] a revelation every time God sends this
[47:54] life in a into us every time there's
[47:57] those little
[47:58] microorganisms coming from Heaven coming
[48:01] from above entering into our life this
[48:04] is how it will work
[48:07] Hallelujah
[48:09] it's it's a major principle of the
[48:11] kingdom of God how it works practically
[48:13] in our lives
[48:15] oh I love the Practical side of the
[48:17] seven seal you know this this is what
[48:19] makes me happy you know and this is what
[48:22] I believe it actually this was make the
[48:25] sisters listening to Jesus preach happy
[48:27] because they finally understood oh is it
[48:30] that simple I thought it was a gap
[48:32] between this and that seal you know and
[48:34] and those you know the vials and
[48:36] everything and I I know it is there but
[48:39] the principles are really simple
[48:43] it they are available by Revelation to
[48:46] any age
[48:49] thank you Jesus so so the the first
[48:51] thing that actually uh the woman had to
[48:54] do
[48:56] she had to take it
[48:58] she had to take the level she had to
[49:01] receive it
[49:04] oh this is the first thing we actually
[49:06] do with the Life of Christ with the
[49:09] revelation of Jesus Christ with
[49:11] something coming from the heaven coming
[49:14] from the kingdom of God refers have to
[49:17] receive it it should be our initiative
[49:20] it should be our desire it is our desire
[49:23] we want it
[49:26] sometimes we don't realize but we want
[49:28] it
[49:29] brother President says we are made to
[49:32] thirst for God we are made to thirst for
[49:34] that leaven we have made two thirst for
[49:37] the kingdom of God we're quenching The
[49:39] Thirst with somebody it's something else
[49:40] that that that's that's a problem but
[49:42] our real desire is for the kingdom of
[49:45] God
[49:46] thank you Jesus so you really want it
[49:49] and then you'd it's the principle across
[49:51] the Bible you gotta go and take it
[49:54] Ruth had to go and claim it
[49:58] Esther had to go and claim it
[50:00] John had to go and take the book
[50:04] oh the book is here oh that's fine yeah
[50:06] it's wonderful it is revealed oh yeah it
[50:08] is revealed now go and take it
[50:12] it is your desire
[50:14] and and no one no one's to blame you
[50:17] know we were standing there and not
[50:18] taking it right it's because it is your
[50:21] desire and God expects you he says draw
[50:24] near unto me and I'll draw near unto you
[50:26] make a step of Faith I'll make a step
[50:29] towards you God says oh it is so
[50:33] wonderful and he's never failed of doing
[50:36] this so as as as soon as you take it
[50:39] it's in your hands now it's your
[50:41] responsibility this is your leaven now
[50:44] this is your Revelation Hallelujah
[50:48] somebody preaches you know here at the
[50:49] pulpit the pastor preaches to somebody
[50:51] else uh preaches and this Revelation
[50:54] coming out and now you receive it this
[50:57] is yours now it's not his anymore
[51:00] this is your Revelation though this is
[51:03] your level this is something you got in
[51:05] your hands hallelujah thank you Jesus
[51:09] this is this is a piece of 11 there's a
[51:10] there's a REV there's a microorganism
[51:12] there's a life behind that and you know
[51:15] what it it works perfectly well when you
[51:19] know you you you would sometimes wonder
[51:21] you know this preacher is standing here
[51:23] you know or a pastor or whoever you know
[51:26] is ordained to or to do that and he's
[51:28] preaching something to you and you
[51:30] accept it and it works
[51:33] it really works there's life inside of
[51:35] there there's a microorganism inside of
[51:38] there that has a transforming power
[51:41] Hallelujah why is because because in
[51:45] fact the mechanics of this is that this
[51:47] this Minister there he actually tested
[51:51] the leaven in his life
[51:54] this is where most of the time it works
[51:56] on other people
[51:57] and then he preaches and says it's good
[52:00] it works
[52:01] there's life in there I can prove it
[52:05] it's working just like a Rahab remember
[52:08] when she when she came when she received
[52:10] the spies why did the token work because
[52:13] it first worked for her
[52:16] how can we apply the token to our
[52:18] families for our children for our loved
[52:21] ones if only if it works for us first
[52:25] if the leaven is there
[52:27] and she she knew they spared her life
[52:30] she was dead sure she they will spare
[52:33] her and her dad and her mom and her
[52:35] brother and the sister so she was like
[52:37] come on guys it's coming in it works it
[52:39] works I'm not sure about that well I got
[52:42] a testimony about it
[52:44] praise the Lord so it's there's a life
[52:47] inside of there there's a leaven inside
[52:49] of there inside of that token that
[52:52] really works for you and if it works for
[52:54] you program says if you haven't have
[52:56] faith for yourself
[52:58] if you have enough level for your 11 for
[53:01] yourself if you have enough Revelation
[53:03] for yourself use the same substance
[53:06] thank you Jesus it's the same stuff the
[53:08] same material it's just like water you
[53:09] can water plants with it you can drink
[53:11] it you can you know wash your windshield
[53:14] whatever with it it's the same substance
[53:17] you can use it multi-progress that's
[53:20] faith
[53:21] thank you Jesus so same thing goes with
[53:23] 11. you take it and you know it really
[53:26] works
[53:30] Hallelujah you receive it it is actually
[53:33] your effort of Faith now this is the
[53:36] first step and the woman is really happy
[53:38] oh man I've got some Bakery in my mind I
[53:41] got something you know that I'll really
[53:43] fix this will be good this will be a
[53:45] really nice delicious you know so so she
[53:48] now she has those those those those two
[53:52] components
[53:53] she has the level
[53:55] and and she also has the meal
[53:59] and the meal if you look it up the word
[54:01] actually means wheat flour so that's
[54:04] wheat
[54:06] it used to be corn you know there used
[54:08] to be a grain but now now it's it's it's
[54:11] ground into into a flower
[54:15] so she had to to mix those two
[54:18] components
[54:20] together
[54:22] and to change their form oh it's it's
[54:25] really wonderful we'll we'll get into
[54:27] that for you in a while Lord willing so
[54:29] the second thing she actually has to do
[54:32] is is she actually has to work with it
[54:35] she actually has to mix it
[54:39] you your sisters would know you know and
[54:41] those brothers who know more about
[54:43] baking I don't know you know basically
[54:45] anything about it but you know because I
[54:47] don't have to you know I have a Master
[54:49] Chef you know at home so you know and
[54:52] and now you you but but basically you
[54:55] don't do it like this you you it's not
[54:57] that you know you uh you take some
[55:01] uh you know it takes some dough and
[55:05] whatever you have here okay
[55:07] and then uh
[55:10] and then then you add some leaven to it
[55:12] right you just you don't like let it
[55:14] just stick like this right it's just
[55:16] like oh okay I've I've done my part you
[55:19] know I've I've edited to just though
[55:22] it's it's there I can go now
[55:25] no
[55:27] what do we actually actually have to do
[55:29] is you actually have to mix this thing
[55:31] into into though
[55:35] she has to mix it she has a meal it
[55:39] right it takes some work
[55:43] so sometimes it's a little piece like
[55:46] this but sometimes it's a bigger one
[55:49] and you need some help sometimes you
[55:51] look tired oh man I'm tired mixing it
[55:54] you know maybe you can help me oh sure
[55:55] it can help you you know so so it takes
[55:58] some work and uh you know the word you
[56:01] know uh hide because it says she took
[56:04] the leaven and she hid it in the three
[56:06] measures it actually means to mix it but
[56:10] but I like I like the word to hide
[56:13] you know too because it refers to the
[56:16] Mysteries it refers to being inside of
[56:19] there somehow you know and there's you
[56:22] know just like brother Brian would
[56:23] preach hidden life in Christ how it's
[56:25] there is because it's mixed into you
[56:29] oh thank you it is you know it is a
[56:32] mystery between you and God and and it
[56:35] takes different types of mixing no if
[56:37] you take the woman as a church it's
[56:40] sometimes hard work
[56:42] to take the revelation
[56:45] and he got the church which is the dough
[56:47] which is the meal
[56:49] right and you have someone in the church
[56:51] who is active doing and has the word and
[56:54] knows what to do with the word
[56:56] right
[56:57] and what he he actually has to do they
[57:00] have a lot of they have a lot of work
[57:02] mixing that 11 that Revelation into the
[57:06] people
[57:07] right
[57:09] into the worship area into the into the
[57:12] Sunday School into the Deacons
[57:15] into the mothers into the fathers into
[57:18] the young people
[57:20] there's a lot of work
[57:23] praise the Lord and you can see that one
[57:25] part of this dough is already
[57:28] leavened
[57:30] whereas the other is not
[57:33] and there's no reason to say well this
[57:35] is lemon this is not I mean yeah see
[57:39] no it just takes more work
[57:41] it just takes more effort
[57:44] it just takes more time
[57:46] and sometimes you know the Lord uses the
[57:49] circumstances of Wildlife and he he just
[57:51] throws us into a dough mixer you know
[57:54] and
[57:56] and there we go Lord why are you doing
[57:59] this well there's some lemon you you
[58:01] haven't absorbed yet so you know and and
[58:05] sometimes as areas in our life you know
[58:07] that has not been leavened yet do you
[58:10] have those areas or am I the only one
[58:13] here standing that you know I'm not
[58:15] fully leavened yet and I'm I'm going
[58:18] into there but there's still areas which
[58:20] you know they you feel like this should
[58:22] be more victory in there there should be
[58:24] more life and there should be more
[58:25] Revelation there should be more
[58:27] understanding sometimes you won't like
[58:29] to do it but but you it's not revealed
[58:32] unto you so far so what do what do you
[58:35] do you got you have to mix it into your
[58:38] life more you have to have more of that
[58:40] and wait until it leavens the whole lump
[58:45] oh thank you Jesus so so what what what
[58:47] this woman actually does this church
[58:49] actually does you she mixes it with the
[58:52] dough
[58:53] oh so it's hidden in there there's a
[58:57] mystery inside
[59:00] and and and and when she mixes it and
[59:03] and she she realizes it's not the same
[59:06] substance anymore
[59:08] this leaven is is mixed into it now
[59:12] there's something inside of there
[59:15] and the leaven doesn't do anything it
[59:17] doesn't really shout it doesn't really
[59:18] scream uh it doesn't produce any any
[59:22] sound probably but what what it actually
[59:24] is it is a silence
[59:27] it is a process of Silence where
[59:30] something really mixes into a different
[59:32] form it is it is a a quickening process
[59:36] it is a transformation process so it's a
[59:39] mystery inside of you doesn't that
[59:40] remind you of Revelation 8 1 where it
[59:44] says the land when the lamb took the
[59:45] book and uh he he opened the seventh
[59:48] seal there was silence in heaven
[59:52] for half an hour oh praise be to Jesus
[59:57] thank you there's a mystery going on
[1:00:00] the mystery is being revealed in where
[1:00:02] in your life
[1:00:04] in your dough in your practical life
[1:00:08] oh we've just been a you know the camp
[1:00:11] was uh brother Eugene and there was a
[1:00:13] minister from uh Calgary and he had a
[1:00:16] little session and uh you know we just
[1:00:19] looked at this a little verse where the
[1:00:22] Bible says that women shall learn in
[1:00:25] silence
[1:00:26] you you know the verse right
[1:00:29] and immediately while we were just you
[1:00:31] know speaking about that you know
[1:00:32] because because this leaven is so good
[1:00:34] you know it's just it just penetrates
[1:00:36] into every every little scripture you
[1:00:38] know every little principle in the Bible
[1:00:39] so it's almost like you're speaking
[1:00:42] about conduct here you know not deserve
[1:00:44] Authority and you know learning in
[1:00:46] silence but it is the seventh seal in
[1:00:48] there as well you know a woman that is
[1:00:51] learning in silence is the bride
[1:00:55] oh praise be to Jesus Revelation 1 8 1
[1:00:59] says and when he had opened the seventh
[1:01:01] seal there was silence in heaven
[1:01:04] so if you're standing there in the
[1:01:06] seventh seal this Christ in reality is
[1:01:09] and the word itself Jesus Christ who is
[1:01:12] The Great I Am who is Jesus Christ the
[1:01:14] yesterday today and forever he is being
[1:01:16] revealed to you
[1:01:19] you start learning in silence
[1:01:23] you're not teaching him he's teaching
[1:01:26] you
[1:01:27] this is how brother brano opened the
[1:01:29] opened the series on the seals and says
[1:01:32] you know God in Simplicity he reads this
[1:01:34] verse from Matthew and he says I thank
[1:01:37] you Father that you have not revealed
[1:01:38] this to the wise of prudent but you have
[1:01:40] revealed that unto whom unto babes and
[1:01:43] he would always add this phrase such as
[1:01:46] would learn and we can add another
[1:01:49] phrase here
[1:01:50] from context
[1:01:52] in silence
[1:01:55] the babes that should learn such as
[1:01:57] would learn in silence
[1:02:00] because they have nothing to say they
[1:02:01] have lots to learn that's it this is how
[1:02:04] job received the Revelation he talked he
[1:02:07] was talking he was preaching he was
[1:02:08] explaining he was condemning he was
[1:02:10] accusing he was justifying he was doing
[1:02:12] this and and when the seven sealed
[1:02:14] himself stood right in front of him in
[1:02:17] all kinds of questions types this 44
[1:02:19] questions posed and he's standing there
[1:02:21] and he's old
[1:02:23] just like the Angels were owed in the
[1:02:26] half an hour there silence and he's
[1:02:28] learning
[1:02:31] and what did he learn it says I got
[1:02:34] nothing to say
[1:02:35] I have lots to learn
[1:02:39] oh thank you this is this is how we
[1:02:41] learn this is how we learn because when
[1:02:44] this word is revealed to us we're owed
[1:02:46] by this and we it's not that no I don't
[1:02:48] agree with this you know I gotta think
[1:02:50] about that I I have no explanation for
[1:02:52] this but with real encounter with the
[1:02:54] seventh seal this is where you're old
[1:02:56] with it so much you're you're ready to
[1:02:58] shut up and say Lord I'm learning
[1:03:01] Lord I'll learn in silence now I'm the
[1:03:06] woman who's in in the verse actually
[1:03:08] says a woman should learn in Silence
[1:03:10] with all subjection it's not that
[1:03:13] I'll Stand and I'll listen through there
[1:03:16] here I'll be silent for a while
[1:03:20] but it's not that I agree with it no it
[1:03:24] says in Silence with all subjection that
[1:03:27] is
[1:03:29] anything but the truth this is something
[1:03:32] that is being revealed and often to me
[1:03:34] oh this is there's lots to learn can you
[1:03:36] repeat that again I haven't put that on
[1:03:39] my nose you know I should put that on
[1:03:41] the tables of my heart yes thank you
[1:03:44] Jesus Hallelujah
[1:03:46] oh thank you Father because it wasn't
[1:03:49] just in the description falls on it says
[1:03:52] it was it wasn't Adam who is this it was
[1:03:54] the evil it was us who were deceived
[1:03:57] because I swear the wrong Revelation he
[1:03:59] was asked who had the wrong
[1:04:00] understanding but he has the right
[1:04:03] understanding Christ himself so he went
[1:04:05] he also opens up to you in a simple way
[1:04:07] as in as this little Parable here
[1:04:10] say Lord is it that simple
[1:04:13] well then then I want to learn
[1:04:16] then I want to learn
[1:04:19] oh because Christ is it is the second
[1:04:22] seal is is a person
[1:04:24] it is Christ himself it's somebody
[1:04:25] talking
[1:04:27] somebody explaining somebody loving you
[1:04:29] somebody have an affection with you oh
[1:04:31] Jesus thank you Hallelujah
[1:04:35] oh thank you Father so so are you
[1:04:38] sitting in church and you you know
[1:04:40] you've maybe have been there for
[1:04:42] Wednesday night service and you hear the
[1:04:44] word and you hear how they like
[1:04:47] Broadband says this Revelation opens
[1:04:49] wide before our wandering eyes
[1:04:53] and then he says and then when we
[1:04:56] receive it we are edified and purified
[1:04:58] by the spirit and made ready for his
[1:05:01] glare glorious appearing well this is
[1:05:03] what happening every time we believe
[1:05:04] every time we receive a revelation from
[1:05:07] God
[1:05:07] oh thank you Father oh yes thank you
[1:05:11] Jesus so let's go into the meal part
[1:05:13] here you know she she takes the lemon
[1:05:16] she knows it works it has the right
[1:05:19] microorganism inside of there so she's
[1:05:22] really willing and exciting oh
[1:05:25] well I love this church I love those
[1:05:27] people and I really want them to grasp
[1:05:30] this so so this this church this this
[1:05:32] woman she she actually takes this leaven
[1:05:35] and she's like anticipating oh now when
[1:05:40] they grasp this Revelation oh it will
[1:05:42] work
[1:05:43] oh it will be so good you know
[1:05:46] so
[1:05:48] the meal is actually made of grain but
[1:05:50] the the parable doesn't say she had to
[1:05:53] mix the leaven with the grain
[1:05:57] right so the grain the wheat had to
[1:06:00] undergo a certain process before
[1:06:04] 11 was actually added
[1:06:06] right
[1:06:08] and and the process is not nice
[1:06:12] because
[1:06:13] before that you would have different
[1:06:18] sizes of the grains right oh you have a
[1:06:21] lot of stuff here to use as
[1:06:23] as visual aids you know so so so you
[1:06:27] would have a grain this size
[1:06:30] and then you would have a grain this
[1:06:32] size
[1:06:33] and you would have a grain this size
[1:06:37] and we have a tall grain like this you
[1:06:40] know
[1:06:41] and before
[1:06:43] before they go into the process of
[1:06:47] grinding
[1:06:49] they're all different sizes
[1:06:52] right
[1:06:53] sorry this may be for the kids you know
[1:06:56] you never know so it depends on what the
[1:06:58] audience is pulling you know so
[1:07:02] but but I mean just different we we come
[1:07:06] up you know as as as bright material as
[1:07:09] bright raw material
[1:07:11] we come in different sizes
[1:07:14] right we come come in you know and and
[1:07:17] you know sometimes uh you know these
[1:07:20] guys are kind of the same but when this
[1:07:22] guy shows up
[1:07:24] it's like
[1:07:27] oh I'm a real grain you know
[1:07:31] oh
[1:07:33] so so they're all you know coming into
[1:07:37] the grinding machine but but they
[1:07:39] they're talking in between themselves
[1:07:41] and they're saying you know you know
[1:07:43] this this guy says you know I'm kind of
[1:07:45] one of the tallest and biggest and
[1:07:47] citizens of this one that says and I've
[1:07:49] always lived a clean life you know you
[1:07:52] know and this and this and this guy says
[1:07:54] well I'm kind of the the highest and the
[1:07:56] tallest here and I'm kind of you know
[1:07:58] really stylish and nice here but how
[1:08:01] about this guy
[1:08:02] and this guy doesn't even open his mouth
[1:08:04] you know he's like
[1:08:06] is is looking up to all of them is like
[1:08:11] am I will I ever make it
[1:08:16] but this guy here you know he lifts his
[1:08:18] voice and he says
[1:08:19] you all guys
[1:08:21] you don't know what you're talking about
[1:08:23] you know
[1:08:24] because you know I'm so big and tall
[1:08:27] nobody can beat me
[1:08:29] well nobody except the grinding machine
[1:08:38] oh my goodness
[1:08:39] so then then the Lord takes all of them
[1:08:43] Embraces because he actually loves all
[1:08:45] of them
[1:08:46] so he loves all of them and he's like oh
[1:08:50] you you look nice now but after you come
[1:08:53] out from there you look even nicer
[1:08:57] so so he opens up you know the the
[1:08:59] machine oh you got the machine here
[1:09:01] right yeah so he opens you know the the
[1:09:04] uh the the grinding machine and he
[1:09:07] throws all of this into here
[1:09:11] and there's
[1:09:13] a lot of work
[1:09:16] there's a lot of Trials you know brother
[1:09:18] Brown says but today I know it was all
[1:09:20] working for my good I know the life had
[1:09:23] to be ground
[1:09:24] Twisted squeezed and to get what it was
[1:09:29] out
[1:09:30] there was too much Brenham in there had
[1:09:32] to be squeezed out before God could take
[1:09:34] himself known
[1:09:36] so that means before you receive a
[1:09:38] revelation before crisis is ready to to
[1:09:41] be added as leaven you should be meal by
[1:09:44] then
[1:09:45] you should be grounded by then
[1:09:47] oh
[1:09:49] because without humility you you're not
[1:09:51] receiving revelation
[1:09:54] Hallelujah
[1:09:56] so all of these guys go into the
[1:09:58] grinding machine and when they get out
[1:10:01] there's no big ones
[1:10:03] there's no tall ones there's no
[1:10:05] transparent ones there's no small ones
[1:10:08] they are all the same size
[1:10:13] and by then they are already mixed
[1:10:14] together
[1:10:18] [Laughter]
[1:10:24] I was like you know
[1:10:26] did you did you also have to go through
[1:10:28] that oh yeah
[1:10:31] did your kids do that oh yeah
[1:10:35] did you pray for so many nights and days
[1:10:37] oh yeah
[1:10:39] do they have a problem with your job oh
[1:10:41] yeah
[1:10:43] do they have a health issue oh yeah all
[1:10:46] of these
[1:10:47] we all have to go through that
[1:10:51] in the grinding machine
[1:10:54] in the milling machine and when we come
[1:10:57] out we're not big there's no big
[1:11:00] and important Brothers anymore
[1:11:05] amen
[1:11:08] there's no small ones that we would look
[1:11:10] down on
[1:11:13] thank you Jesus
[1:11:15] amen hallelujah
[1:11:18] oh praise the Lord
[1:11:26] brother Bram actually ties it to to
[1:11:28] Christ and he says the meal offering and
[1:11:30] the true and false Vines and he says the
[1:11:32] middle offering any teacher knows that
[1:11:33] the meal offering waiver offering heave
[1:11:35] offering all the offerings pertain to
[1:11:37] Jesus
[1:11:38] and the little meal offering must be
[1:11:40] ground with birds and that cuts every
[1:11:43] little speck the same
[1:11:45] every little grain of corn must be cut
[1:11:48] the same
[1:11:49] and they had a handful of it and that
[1:11:52] means Jesus Christ the meal offering the
[1:11:55] same yesterday today and forever which
[1:11:57] is the seventh seal which is Christ
[1:11:59] reveal which is the real Christ
[1:12:03] so it takes the word you have to
[1:12:05] understand that every word is the same
[1:12:10] every word is Cuts this the promise of
[1:12:13] the healing is the same of the the same
[1:12:15] promise of the Redemption same size
[1:12:19] Redemption has healing in it healing has
[1:12:22] redemption in it right so it just breaks
[1:12:25] the word into those little chunks where
[1:12:27] you can see is Jesus Christ the same
[1:12:30] size
[1:12:31] yeah this is what brother Brown says
[1:12:33] here right in the meal offering
[1:12:36] oh thank you Jesus so as long as you see
[1:12:39] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:12:41] forever you believe him you're the meal
[1:12:44] you're the dog
[1:12:47] Hallelujah
[1:12:49] oh thank you Father
[1:12:54] so now she has to do some work we have
[1:12:57] to do some work
[1:12:59] we gotta mix it inside of our lives
[1:13:01] right
[1:13:03] that's why that's why we you know do
[1:13:06] devotions that's why we pray that's why
[1:13:08] we have a family altar
[1:13:10] it is sometimes difficult sometimes you
[1:13:13] you come you're all you know tired
[1:13:15] you're dead tired and you're like you
[1:13:17] know sit down on your sofa and you're
[1:13:18] kind of oversleep all day you know
[1:13:20] evening devotions oh sorry guys
[1:13:26] but but it takes some effort sometimes
[1:13:31] to pull yourself up from the sofa
[1:13:34] set yourself down with the kids and the
[1:13:37] Bible or the message or whatever you you
[1:13:39] know praying with them about and things
[1:13:41] it takes some effort
[1:13:45] you gotta mix it I'm gonna mix it into
[1:13:47] your family
[1:13:48] the more you mix it
[1:13:50] the better it becomes
[1:13:53] Hallelujah
[1:13:56] so so then the third stage oh this third
[1:13:59] stage you thought those two stages were
[1:14:02] were difficult no
[1:14:03] taking it receiving it just like Ruth
[1:14:05] making a decision taking it is fine
[1:14:09] mixing it is fine but then waiting for
[1:14:12] it
[1:14:13] oh
[1:14:15] that looks like the hardest I think to
[1:14:17] me especially you know because you you
[1:14:20] want it immediately you want the effect
[1:14:22] right there you know did you receive the
[1:14:25] revelations yes does it work no
[1:14:30] then you didn't receive the revelation
[1:14:32] no sometimes it takes time
[1:14:36] for this yeast for this level to kind of
[1:14:38] spread in your life
[1:14:40] spread from your heart into your brain
[1:14:43] into your body into your family it takes
[1:14:47] time until the whole thing is leavens
[1:14:52] so the purpose is to let this
[1:14:55] microorganism inside of you and then
[1:14:57] spread it around
[1:14:59] oh thank you Jesus Hallelujah
[1:15:04] oh
[1:15:05] thank you Jesus
[1:15:09] amen
[1:15:11] the good part of the living is it is
[1:15:13] contagious
[1:15:16] in both the negative and the positive
[1:15:19] sense you know if you take the 11 from
[1:15:20] the negative side you know just they
[1:15:22] they you talk about insincerity talk
[1:15:25] about you know those things you know
[1:15:27] that 11 represents the leaven of the
[1:15:29] Pharisees the you know the doctrine of
[1:15:31] the Pharisees it is contagious and Jesus
[1:15:33] warned he says don't do it don't touch
[1:15:35] it keep away from it because it'll
[1:15:37] spread like fire you you get a little
[1:15:40] bit of of that inside of you you'll just
[1:15:43] you won't even notice
[1:15:44] how it gets right into into your dough
[1:15:47] but let's look at it from the positive
[1:15:49] side
[1:15:50] [Laughter]
[1:15:52] it's the Life of Christ that wants to
[1:15:55] penetrate into every single area of your
[1:15:59] life not only into the two rooms where
[1:16:01] the Brahm says into the third room
[1:16:04] into all the areas of life
[1:16:06] that's why she
[1:16:09] will be him brother bam says she will
[1:16:13] become the word
[1:16:14] she is not the word are you the word now
[1:16:17] potentially you are
[1:16:20] but let's look at your circumstances
[1:16:21] that your flesh and things like this oh
[1:16:23] man there's a lot you know unleavened
[1:16:25] Parts just like me
[1:16:29] do you believe that well if you believe
[1:16:31] that then you you do understand there's
[1:16:33] some more leaven has to come into there
[1:16:36] right
[1:16:38] thank you Jesus
[1:16:39] Hallelujah so she is becoming the word
[1:16:44] she is becoming Jesus Christ
[1:16:46] all her areas of her life are gradually
[1:16:49] coming into it
[1:16:51] oh it's a wonderful process thank you
[1:16:54] Jesus Hallelujah
[1:16:57] oh wow
[1:16:59] so when we
[1:17:03] when we look at this this uh kingdom of
[1:17:06] God you know it actually is Jesus is not
[1:17:09] talking about Kingdom of man
[1:17:11] he's talking about the kingdom of God
[1:17:13] that's the kingdom of heaven right
[1:17:17] so it's a
[1:17:21] something coming from Heaven this little
[1:17:24] piece this little leaven coming from
[1:17:25] heaven and what it actually wants it
[1:17:28] wants to materialize
[1:17:30] here on Earth
[1:17:32] it wants to find a body that will
[1:17:34] subject itself to it and live in it
[1:17:40] Hallelujah and that's the main principle
[1:17:42] that Jesus was actually teaching
[1:17:44] right receive that into your heart mix
[1:17:48] it with your life and wait
[1:17:50] until it actually leavens the whole lump
[1:17:55] Hallelujah
[1:18:01] Hallelujah
[1:18:04] and then there's three
[1:18:06] measures of meal I love this you know I
[1:18:09] was just thinking of that oh there's
[1:18:11] three is perfection right
[1:18:15] so if you take if you take the dough if
[1:18:17] you take the meal
[1:18:20] you cannot add to it and you cannot take
[1:18:23] away from it
[1:18:26] because if the Mila is is is the grains
[1:18:28] the wheat is the children of the Kingdom
[1:18:30] then there's a set number of them
[1:18:33] right
[1:18:35] just like Revelation the end of the book
[1:18:37] of Revelation you cannot add to the book
[1:18:39] and you cannot take away from the book
[1:18:43] who's the book
[1:18:47] it's the people
[1:18:49] who is the meal
[1:18:51] it's the people
[1:18:52] you cannot add to it you cannot take
[1:18:54] away that's three perfection
[1:18:57] there's a perfect number
[1:18:59] Hallelujah
[1:19:01] all just tells me the story that the
[1:19:03] bride the full bride
[1:19:07] will actually come to perfection
[1:19:10] will be fully leavened Hallelujah
[1:19:16] everybody who's on the books uh Lamb's
[1:19:19] Book of Life
[1:19:20] will be leavened
[1:19:26] thank you Jesus
[1:19:27] Hallelujah
[1:19:31] well if we go into some other practical
[1:19:35] areas you know we we will we can
[1:19:37] definitely see that uh
[1:19:41] mixing this 11 into our life takes a lot
[1:19:45] of diligence you know because uh Paul
[1:19:48] I'm sorry Peter actually says you
[1:19:52] you know the man that goes into the
[1:19:54] Rapture he says is is the statue of the
[1:19:56] perfect man right
[1:19:58] the one that has those virtues the one
[1:20:00] that that lives with the nature of
[1:20:02] Christ inside but then Peter says you
[1:20:04] have to add all diligence right
[1:20:07] giving all diligence add your to your
[1:20:10] faith virtue
[1:20:13] so this is a this is a process of mixing
[1:20:17] right
[1:20:18] because Faith actually drives all the
[1:20:21] other vergers
[1:20:24] you do all of those things by faith
[1:20:27] right
[1:20:28] Patience by faith knowledge
[1:20:31] not by intellectual by faith
[1:20:34] right
[1:20:36] virtue
[1:20:37] not because they're good men because by
[1:20:39] faith
[1:20:40] because by Revelation so you're adding
[1:20:43] you adding you're actually taking this
[1:20:45] this uh this leaven of faith and and
[1:20:48] Revelation and adding it into your life
[1:20:52] and mixing it into it because I've
[1:20:55] always wondered why Peter is saying
[1:20:57] giving all diligence
[1:20:59] being really tick make an effort
[1:21:03] not a flashlight
[1:21:04] effort but an effort of Faith a step of
[1:21:08] faith
[1:21:09] an Act of Faith
[1:21:11] thank you Jesus Hallelujah you will say
[1:21:14] oh but Brahm said you know you don't
[1:21:16] make any effort you're a sheep you know
[1:21:18] and you know all those virtues grow in
[1:21:19] it
[1:21:20] right
[1:21:21] didn't he say that he says don't don't
[1:21:23] put those you know feathers into the
[1:21:25] bird into the black bird it'll grow it
[1:21:28] is natural that's fine
[1:21:32] and then you you can also say just like
[1:21:34] me but I'm a sheep it's just natural for
[1:21:37] me to grow virgins
[1:21:39] it is
[1:21:41] but you have don't you have to make some
[1:21:43] effort oh no I'll just sit there and and
[1:21:45] wait until the virtues grow
[1:21:48] no there's one definite effort that you
[1:21:52] have to do
[1:21:53] is eat
[1:21:55] is feed
[1:21:58] because if you just take a sheep you
[1:22:00] know and say oh you got this automatic
[1:22:03] inside of you this this is gonna grow
[1:22:05] inside of you wonderful congratulations
[1:22:08] and you leave the Sheep you know
[1:22:10] somewhere closed and locked and no food
[1:22:13] no water no nothing you come out
[1:22:16] there'll be some some you know some wool
[1:22:19] on on her you know but she might be dead
[1:22:22] by then you know
[1:22:24] so you know it takes some diligence it
[1:22:28] takes some effort you're feeding on the
[1:22:30] body word of the son of man you're
[1:22:32] eating on the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:22:34] you're eating you're feeding on the word
[1:22:36] then it grows
[1:22:37] you're mixing this word with your life
[1:22:40] then it grows
[1:22:44] thank you Jesus
[1:22:45] hallelujah oh you know when you read it
[1:22:48] there's a wonderful place here in the uh
[1:22:51] in second Peter 1 it actually says
[1:22:53] according to his divine power given to
[1:22:55] us all things that pertain to life
[1:22:56] godliness for the knowledge of him that
[1:22:59] has called us before he mentions all the
[1:23:02] virtues he says he has called us to
[1:23:05] glory and virtue
[1:23:09] oh that makes us you know that produces
[1:23:13] a smile on my face
[1:23:14] because if God calls you to something
[1:23:18] oh that's that's an assurance
[1:23:23] if you're not called to this you will
[1:23:25] never produce it but if you called to
[1:23:27] that it means God knows you have those
[1:23:31] virtues inside of you you will be able
[1:23:34] to make it you will be able to grow them
[1:23:36] you will be able to add Faith to Virtue
[1:23:38] to knowledge to all those Hallelujah and
[1:23:42] he says you are he has called us to
[1:23:45] glory and virtue
[1:23:47] he has called us to a glorious condition
[1:23:49] it called us to a glorious body
[1:23:53] Hallelujah
[1:23:54] and he has called us through the virtues
[1:23:56] of Jesus Christ to be
[1:23:59] reflected in us to be to be
[1:24:01] manifestedness and then he goes on into
[1:24:03] all the and he says in giving all
[1:24:04] diligence head to your faith virtue
[1:24:06] virgin knowledge Temperance patience and
[1:24:09] all those and and then he goes on to say
[1:24:11] and he says and uh wherefore
[1:24:14] uh their other brothers give
[1:24:17] diligence to make your calling an
[1:24:20] election sure
[1:24:21] I've never tied those two callings it's
[1:24:23] the same
[1:24:28] the fact that God called you to the
[1:24:30] virtues God called you to the life of
[1:24:33] Jesus Christ inside of you
[1:24:35] is your calling
[1:24:38] is your general calling because
[1:24:40] sometimes we think it's it's only the
[1:24:42] specific calling you you're called to be
[1:24:44] a preacher you're called to be a
[1:24:45] minister you're called to be a song
[1:24:46] leader called to be a singer you're
[1:24:47] called to be a something this is a
[1:24:50] specific role this is just a span of
[1:24:52] time this is maybe just five years of
[1:24:55] your life
[1:24:56] right but what are you actually called
[1:24:59] to you are actually in general for the
[1:25:01] whole of your Christian Life you're
[1:25:03] called unto the glory and the virtues
[1:25:09] Hallelujah this is your calling and you
[1:25:11] got to make it sure
[1:25:13] Hallelujah that you're elected and
[1:25:16] you're also called to produce the life
[1:25:18] of Jesus Christ here here on Earth the
[1:25:20] literal life the hidden life
[1:25:23] oh thank you Jesus Hallelujah and then
[1:25:27] he goes on to say and if you give
[1:25:28] diligence and make your calling election
[1:25:30] sure he says if you do these things you
[1:25:32] shall never fail because you have faith
[1:25:35] I am called to to produce that
[1:25:37] do you have patience well ask me I don't
[1:25:40] have any patience
[1:25:43] I didn't have patience two generations
[1:25:45] ago
[1:25:46] you know talk about now
[1:25:49] my father or my grandfather they didn't
[1:25:53] have patience
[1:25:54] you know I think inherited impatience
[1:25:58] so my you know my my my physical
[1:26:02] reaction to things will be oh no I'll
[1:26:04] never make it you know
[1:26:06] be therefore perfect just like your
[1:26:08] father oh no never
[1:26:11] but if you understand you are called to
[1:26:13] produce that you are called by Jesus
[1:26:16] Christ to show that in your life
[1:26:18] oh then it brings peace and rest
[1:26:22] and then if you said that well he never
[1:26:24] lies
[1:26:25] Hallelujah I can be sure about it and I
[1:26:28] can make my calling sure too
[1:26:31] Hallelujah make sure I cast away all the
[1:26:34] doubts I I cast away all the physical
[1:26:36] things that I can see in my life
[1:26:38] I put them away and I said no I am a Son
[1:26:41] of God and I am called to those things
[1:26:45] Hallelujah
[1:26:46] oh thank you Father because you know
[1:26:49] when they it's it's a process when this
[1:26:51] leaven gets inside of you it actually it
[1:26:54] actually produces you know sometimes
[1:26:56] your sisters would probably notice how
[1:26:58] the yeast you know it produces the
[1:26:59] bubbles you know inside of there you
[1:27:01] know and and it just goes you know the
[1:27:03] dough just grows and grows and grows and
[1:27:06] grows just like you know uh David says
[1:27:10] and my cup overfloweth right because
[1:27:12] when you when you're not careful and you
[1:27:14] you always you know leave it for too
[1:27:17] long you come and it's all over the
[1:27:18] table you know
[1:27:20] right
[1:27:21] so it there's there's some micro this
[1:27:24] fermentation going in there this this
[1:27:26] those those bubbles coming up there's a
[1:27:28] power inside of there so it's just like
[1:27:30] you know brother Brandon he you know he
[1:27:33] takes this um uh message impersonation
[1:27:35] of Christianity and he uh he he he
[1:27:39] expresses you know this he shows this uh
[1:27:42] Parable or shows the example of of the
[1:27:45] wine in in the new bottles in the old
[1:27:47] bottles and in the new bottles and I
[1:27:49] love the way he he does that and he says
[1:27:51] he says when you do he says
[1:27:55] speaks about those bottles and it's the
[1:27:57] same principle you I I think you
[1:27:59] understand right adding 11 to the dough
[1:28:02] is the same as adding wine into the new
[1:28:05] bottles right because they have to
[1:28:07] stretch they have to have life inside of
[1:28:09] them right and this fermentation going
[1:28:11] here fermentation going there so it's
[1:28:13] the same principle
[1:28:14] so if we go into here and he says it's
[1:28:16] just like preaching to the Baptist of
[1:28:18] the Holy Ghost and the real genuine
[1:28:20] power of the Resurrection it's trying to
[1:28:22] place that people
[1:28:25] trying to place that before the people
[1:28:27] when you do
[1:28:28] what happens if you put it in the new
[1:28:31] wines got life
[1:28:34] the new wine is firm is still fermenting
[1:28:37] oh I hope you see it and he says the new
[1:28:39] life is for many the new life is still
[1:28:41] fermenting it's in a new flexible bottle
[1:28:44] where the oil of the enemy or animal is
[1:28:47] still in the skin
[1:28:49] the oil of the whole yearly goes when
[1:28:51] it's in your life it makes you stretch
[1:28:54] it says when the new wine goes to
[1:28:56] pushing out he says the skin will
[1:28:59] stretch
[1:29:00] the dough will stretch
[1:29:03] Hallelujah this is where you're getting
[1:29:05] out of your comfort zone this is where
[1:29:07] you living behind certain things and you
[1:29:10] grow bigger in Christ
[1:29:12] Hallelujah and then he says and
[1:29:15] otherwise when the Bible says Jesus
[1:29:17] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:29:18] forever the new skin will say Amen
[1:29:22] stretch right and he says I'm the life
[1:29:24] of God working in you and the new skin
[1:29:26] will say Amen stretch out what is an
[1:29:29] amen taking it
[1:29:34] ready to mix it it says now Christ
[1:29:37] doesn't anoint ministers to preach the
[1:29:39] gospel just to have it returned back to
[1:29:40] him void but he expects you to receive
[1:29:42] the word to receive the leaven inside of
[1:29:45] you take the woman took the level and in
[1:29:47] receiving the word be ready take
[1:29:55] it take sheepskin that's flexible to the
[1:29:57] word of God this is exactly what's
[1:29:59] happening to us every time
[1:30:01] everything that doesn't stretch we want
[1:30:03] to we want to exchange it with by
[1:30:04] something that is really flexible
[1:30:07] change my heart O Lord to you know turn
[1:30:10] my hearts you know that the very purpose
[1:30:12] why God actually sent Elijah to this
[1:30:15] earth
[1:30:16] was not to you know make people smarter
[1:30:19] what was not to bring another Doctrine
[1:30:21] was not to you know say oh you all the
[1:30:24] denominations are wrong it was actually
[1:30:26] to turn the hearts it's a hard matter
[1:30:30] it's a sensitive stuff you know it's
[1:30:33] something you know that God actually
[1:30:34] sent Elijah and Elijah was very good at
[1:30:37] it he was excellent this was the spirit
[1:30:40] or that when God used it once you know
[1:30:42] God is a great chemist you know so he
[1:30:44] you know he would take you know uh the
[1:30:47] children of Israel once and he said they
[1:30:49] they are harder you know is away from me
[1:30:52] really far away so what do that do I do
[1:30:55] what what kind of ingredients should I
[1:30:57] use maybe I should use Moses Moses
[1:31:00] doesn't work as fine you know maybe oh I
[1:31:03] got Elijah here
[1:31:04] I got the spirit of Elijah which we know
[1:31:07] is Christ with certain attributes right
[1:31:09] so he says well I'll just add this you
[1:31:12] know and and see what what goes on and
[1:31:15] sure enough the whole Israel by a
[1:31:17] Ministry of one man
[1:31:21] turns their heart to God
[1:31:25] and this and this Minister even laughs
[1:31:27] at everybody and he says oh you don't
[1:31:30] believe I'll do it well just pour water
[1:31:34] make it even worse
[1:31:36] make it even more impossible
[1:31:39] because I know that I know that I that I
[1:31:41] know it will come and God will really
[1:31:43] use me because I have my calling and
[1:31:47] election sure
[1:31:48] thank you Jesus
[1:31:51] so he turned the heart Elijah turned the
[1:31:53] hearts John the Baptist was very good at
[1:31:56] turning the hearts
[1:31:58] how about William Brown
[1:32:01] he will definitely do it because there's
[1:32:03] number five going on you know
[1:32:05] you'll not fail because God has a plan
[1:32:08] for number five you know to the Jews
[1:32:13] he will definitely his message and the
[1:32:16] faith that he brought back will
[1:32:18] definitely turn your hearts turn my
[1:32:21] heart back
[1:32:23] Hallelujah
[1:32:24] so this is the purpose of of the message
[1:32:27] why is the Elijah here it's actually to
[1:32:30] change your heart
[1:32:31] actually to turn your heart
[1:32:33] Hallelujah whatever the heart is
[1:32:36] oh thank you Jesus
[1:32:40] and then he goes on to say yes and then
[1:32:43] you everything in the Bible says you'll
[1:32:45] say Amen but brother says but it must
[1:32:48] come from the Bible
[1:32:49] but Brandon is honest not not everything
[1:32:52] that comes out in this bridge is the
[1:32:54] Bible right so it has to be the Bible
[1:32:57] and if it is the Bible then you receive
[1:33:00] it
[1:33:01] oh thank you Jesus for for for for this
[1:33:04] fact because for the new wine only
[1:33:07] ferments wine it only verifies the
[1:33:10] elements that in there so brother
[1:33:12] actually says there's elements in there
[1:33:14] there's the microorganisms in there and
[1:33:16] he says the yeast only presses and he
[1:33:19] says uh
[1:33:21] the yeast only presses forth the bulb of
[1:33:24] the alcohol which makes it a bursting
[1:33:26] profession as the years burst its little
[1:33:29] bubble to make it more perfect
[1:33:35] the dough becomes more perfect
[1:33:38] do we want to become more perfect
[1:33:41] are we reaching for Perfection didn't
[1:33:43] Paul say let's run to Perfection then
[1:33:45] Jesus say let's be perfect just like uh
[1:33:48] he's perfect didn't Paul say where it
[1:33:50] should be the statue of the perfect man
[1:33:53] how do you reach that get the yeast
[1:33:55] inside of you it'll produce bubbles
[1:33:58] bubbles is gases which is a life it's a
[1:34:01] spirit inside of you working
[1:34:03] it's a type
[1:34:05] Hallelujah and brother William says why
[1:34:07] does the little bubble burst
[1:34:11] why does it do things in your life burst
[1:34:16] there was an explosion here this burst
[1:34:18] here this crashed here
[1:34:21] why
[1:34:22] because there was a spirit inside of you
[1:34:24] producing the bubble so that it will
[1:34:26] blow out and Birdman says make you more
[1:34:29] perfect
[1:34:30] [Laughter]
[1:34:33] and he says to give you a better taste
[1:34:40] and he says to give it the better
[1:34:42] substantial holding you are becoming
[1:34:45] stronger
[1:34:46] through the yeast process and to make it
[1:34:49] more stronger and make it so that it
[1:34:52] cannot sour
[1:34:54] oh thank you Jesus
[1:34:58] oh thank you Father
[1:35:00] oh I like this you know especially this
[1:35:02] like a last part of this sentence
[1:35:04] because it it makes it so it cannot sour
[1:35:08] you know
[1:35:10] uh
[1:35:11] you know I I'm a kind of man you know
[1:35:13] you you're probably different but
[1:35:15] everything is written on my face
[1:35:17] you know so so if I'm sour the say the
[1:35:21] face is sour you know it's like
[1:35:22] everybody knows like the family knows
[1:35:24] the church knows you know if it's you
[1:35:26] know
[1:35:27] this kind of thing oh man
[1:35:29] you better don't don't talk to him you
[1:35:31] know
[1:35:33] but but why do we need 11 why do we need
[1:35:36] fermentation why do we need you know
[1:35:38] this those bubbles of yeast inside of us
[1:35:41] because with time the wine becomes
[1:35:44] stronger it's not as sour
[1:35:47] right
[1:35:48] thank you Jesus Hallelujah
[1:35:51] and brother Brian says it actually shows
[1:35:53] from the church all the worldly elements
[1:35:57] like that and preserves the church
[1:36:01] revelation
[1:36:03] shows worldly elements out of the church
[1:36:08] and preserves the church
[1:36:11] thank you Jesus
[1:36:13] Hallelujah
[1:36:17] oh I want that wine I want that that
[1:36:19] level
[1:36:22] thank you Jesus Hallelujah
[1:36:25] it actually has to come to a Perfection
[1:36:27] of of three you know it has to bring
[1:36:31] your whole lump your whole life into
[1:36:35] subjection
[1:36:37] of Jesus Christ
[1:36:39] this woman is learning in Silence with
[1:36:41] all subjection
[1:36:43] thank you Father
[1:36:46] so we're so hell we're so so thankful
[1:36:48] that when the world is really revealed
[1:36:50] it's Progressive right
[1:36:52] because now we can understand that it
[1:36:55] will reach the more the word is revealed
[1:36:57] it will reach more areas of Our Lives
[1:37:02] you know there's more and more
[1:37:04] challenges in our life
[1:37:06] we live in the darkest age
[1:37:09] we don't know what what's happening next
[1:37:12] we don't you know we've just had a this
[1:37:14] uh uh you know the lockdown we had the
[1:37:16] you know all the stuff going on we don't
[1:37:19] know what's going on next right
[1:37:21] but as long we as we have the word
[1:37:24] revealed to us
[1:37:26] there's a guarantee we can face it and
[1:37:29] we can actually meet the challenge
[1:37:32] Hallelujah that's why we need the
[1:37:34] revealed word
[1:37:35] that's why you need we need the word
[1:37:37] that is bubbling
[1:37:39] we need something that really works we
[1:37:42] need
[1:37:43] microorganisms inside of there
[1:37:46] so sometimes we wonder oh how will the
[1:37:49] Lord deal with this part of life of mine
[1:37:51] it's so strange it's so Twisted you know
[1:37:54] it's so it's so strange and it's so
[1:37:57] misunderstood it's so hard you know
[1:38:00] it doesn't matter just makes it mix it
[1:38:03] with revelation
[1:38:05] of the word
[1:38:06] I don't have a revelation on that well
[1:38:09] ask God for revelation
[1:38:11] gee you know brother Brahm says you you
[1:38:13] have to ask for Revelation more than for
[1:38:14] the you know real bread
[1:38:17] because Jesus said God will take care of
[1:38:20] the bread
[1:38:22] but God wants you to receive Revelation
[1:38:25] to ask for it too yes Hallelujah so
[1:38:28] every time we do that we have a
[1:38:30] guarantee we have an assurance it will
[1:38:32] penetrate into those fears of life if we
[1:38:35] allow it to come in there
[1:38:37] oh thank you Father
[1:38:39] you know what brother Brandon when he
[1:38:40] speaks about the wine I love this quote
[1:38:42] and I'll probably be closing soon but he
[1:38:45] says
[1:38:46] uh this is 19. 54 you know as as early
[1:38:51] as that and he actually says
[1:38:54] he speaks about the wine and he says he
[1:38:56] just he went and performed American
[1:38:58] turned water into wine
[1:39:01] Hallelujah
[1:39:03] water into wine
[1:39:05] it had to be water first and then wine
[1:39:09] so you first have to have the word
[1:39:11] inside of you to make sure it is inside
[1:39:13] of you and then it can be turned into
[1:39:15] wine
[1:39:16] right because if it's empty you you
[1:39:18] cannot make anything out of it right but
[1:39:21] if the word is inside of you then Jesus
[1:39:23] can come and turn it into wine and he
[1:39:25] says and turn the water into wine how it
[1:39:28] like to beat and that just for a minute
[1:39:29] to show that he will do it in the
[1:39:31] resurrection how it eventually would
[1:39:33] have been wine it would have been wine
[1:39:35] all right and it went up through the
[1:39:38] vine into the grape out to the vet
[1:39:40] soured fermented come on out and was
[1:39:42] wine but he just bypassed every bit of
[1:39:45] that and made it from Water to Wine see
[1:39:49] and brother Brian says that's the way he
[1:39:52] will do in the resurrection
[1:39:55] the resurrection or the Rapture right
[1:39:58] and he says I won't have to live to be a
[1:40:01] 22 or 23 years old at my best again my
[1:40:04] be an old man shaking broke down like
[1:40:06] that he will just change it
[1:40:10] Hallelujah
[1:40:12] so so this is where the whole lump is
[1:40:15] actually fermented this is where the
[1:40:17] whole lump is actually leavened it
[1:40:19] actually will change your body
[1:40:24] you'll say what do you mean it's very
[1:40:26] simple the revelations you're receiving
[1:40:28] now the revelations you're receiving all
[1:40:30] these years the whatever God reveals to
[1:40:33] you in a simple way the same revelation
[1:40:36] will actually change your body
[1:40:39] Hallelujah
[1:40:41] this is the same caliber of Revelations
[1:40:43] just another revelation of the same
[1:40:45] thing it'll just level up to it
[1:40:48] Hallelujah this will be the last piece
[1:40:51] of the lump of the hole that will have
[1:40:53] to be leavened his buddy here
[1:40:57] Hallelujah
[1:40:58] oh thank you Jesus this 11 is going to
[1:41:02] ferment your whole being
[1:41:04] the same land that changes your soul now
[1:41:08] is the same one that will change your
[1:41:10] body
[1:41:12] same no no no not a different one it's
[1:41:14] the same one and a greater measure in a
[1:41:17] stronger way but it's the same thing
[1:41:19] is it the same 11 same level same
[1:41:21] fermentation same fermentation
[1:41:24] Hallelujah it says the same thing that
[1:41:26] changes your soul the same will change
[1:41:28] your body Hallelujah so that means you
[1:41:39] that will leaven the whole lump
[1:41:42] oh how precious the living becomes then
[1:41:45] right
[1:41:47] oh thank you Jesus
[1:41:51] I love it
[1:41:52] I love that kind of lemon
[1:41:58] same simple revelation
[1:42:01] Hallelujah
[1:42:03] well I hope it was it was useful for for
[1:42:06] the Sisters
[1:42:08] I hope it was useful for the children I
[1:42:10] hope it was useful for those who
[1:42:12] understand a little bit about Baker like
[1:42:13] me you know not really much but
[1:42:16] but it's as simple as that
[1:42:19] thank you Jesus
[1:42:21] Hallelujah and you would say is that
[1:42:24] simple oh yeah
[1:42:26] it's it's that simple it's for the babes
[1:42:29] to learn
[1:42:33] and that makes you really happy and then
[1:42:35] that just really makes you assured that
[1:42:38] you're called to it if that 11 gets into
[1:42:40] your life
[1:42:42] oh it will produce results
[1:42:45] the more you mix it inside of you the
[1:42:48] more it leavens your whole family your
[1:42:50] whole heart there
[1:42:52] whatever it takes
[1:42:54] sometimes it takes hardships sometimes
[1:42:57] it takes separation sometimes it has
[1:42:58] trials that takes illness whatever God
[1:43:02] uses all kinds of different pressures
[1:43:04] because when you mix it it's a pressure
[1:43:08] right
[1:43:11] so this this box can be nice you know
[1:43:13] and but if I if I mix it sorry
[1:43:23] and my intention is good I mean I want
[1:43:25] to mix that into here then it comes out
[1:43:29] all right
[1:43:31] but it's good
[1:43:33] it's even better than it was
[1:43:38] doesn't look like you know physical eyes
[1:43:45] yeah
[1:43:47] let's add more pressure
[1:43:53] sorry Deacons
[1:43:57] oh man
[1:43:59] why do I always have to break the rules
[1:44:03] brother rap crook invited me you know
[1:44:05] for a little tour with my kids through
[1:44:07] the Christian School which is really
[1:44:09] unique you know and here's my you know
[1:44:11] good friend
[1:44:12] so I I took this thing and started
[1:44:15] writing on the board like things like
[1:44:17] brother rap is the best you know and you
[1:44:20] know how can you run the school without
[1:44:22] brother rapping you know and he's like
[1:44:24] rule number one don't write on the on
[1:44:26] the boards
[1:44:32] but you could see he was happy for what
[1:44:34] I was writing
[1:44:37] so when you put more pressure you put
[1:44:40] more illness you put more separation
[1:44:42] more discouragement
[1:44:45] foreign
[1:44:48] yeah exactly this this is what this
[1:44:51] thing says amen
[1:44:53] this is amen I want more of that leaven
[1:44:57] inside of me
[1:44:59] and now I understand the pressures
[1:45:03] oh it just makes us more perfect
[1:45:07] just
[1:45:09] makes it bent out of shape but perfect
[1:45:14] this is this is more perfect than it was
[1:45:18] oh thank you Jesus Hallelujah
[1:45:22] we love it we love the Lord you know
[1:45:24] because it's it's not us doing it you
[1:45:27] know
[1:45:28] it's him doing it
[1:45:31] yeah
[1:45:32] why does he mention pressure about the
[1:45:34] third pool
[1:45:36] right why is pressure
[1:45:39] connected to to the expression of the
[1:45:41] third pool in the bride
[1:45:43] because only in that kind of shape
[1:45:45] you'll cry out
[1:45:50] Hallelujah
[1:45:52] thank you Father
[1:45:55] oh man I ruined it
[1:45:59] oh thank you Father
[1:46:07] so this is what happens when you have
[1:46:09] more of the seventh seal in your life
[1:46:14] unbelievable
[1:46:16] it's almost you know it's almost like
[1:46:18] you you want it to become better
[1:46:20] look nicer
[1:46:23] yeah but it doesn't
[1:46:27] it's just more submissive it just
[1:46:29] becomes more humble
[1:46:31] more believing
[1:46:34] Hallelujah
[1:46:36] oh thank you Jesus
[1:46:40] I think we'll just finish here I think
[1:46:41] we brought the message across and by
[1:46:45] God's grace
[1:46:46] we just want to say Lord
[1:46:49] change me
[1:46:51] Lord
[1:46:53] mix it within me
[1:46:57] Lord I'll wait and see
[1:46:59] what it transforms me into
[1:47:02] oh praise the Lord
[1:47:05] some parts of the body you know some
[1:47:06] parts of the church in some parts of the
[1:47:08] Bride of Jesus Christ you know they they
[1:47:11] receive things earlier
[1:47:13] and some we have to wait
[1:47:17] and some have to wait for us
[1:47:24] and it takes patience
[1:47:27] but we know it'll get there
[1:47:30] and you cannot add it it is concerned
[1:47:33] you know he was speaking to the
[1:47:35] disciples it is the bread of Christ it's
[1:47:37] a set number of people it's three it's
[1:47:39] Perfection you cannot add to it you
[1:47:41] cannot take away those people will make
[1:47:44] sure they'll all level
[1:47:48] thank you Jesus let us maybe stand and
[1:47:50] just say a few words to John Lord
[1:47:54] Jesus we thank you so much for this
[1:47:58] morning when we can just look into your
[1:48:00] word and
[1:48:02] and admire the way you put things into
[1:48:05] such a simple perspective Lord Jesus
[1:48:08] it's you've been standing there in front
[1:48:10] of simple people most of them couldn't
[1:48:11] probably write
[1:48:13] couldn't probably sign their name just
[1:48:16] like brother Brahm says
[1:48:18] but they could catch the revelation
[1:48:21] and we want to be those people Lord
[1:48:24] Hallelujah
[1:48:26] we believe you father Lord and we just
[1:48:29] want to be in your hands
[1:48:31] whatever you want to mix it into it
[1:48:33] whatever Revelation is in the word we
[1:48:35] want to receive it Lord Jesus
[1:48:38] you have come with the prophet of the
[1:48:40] hour to
[1:48:41] reveal the fullness of the word
[1:48:44] the fullness of the leaven the fullness
[1:48:47] of the power of the leaven
[1:48:49] inside of the revelation
[1:48:53] and this is what we want to receive Lord
[1:48:55] Jesus this is what we
[1:48:57] walked onto you to mix into our hearts
[1:48:59] Lord Jesus whatever it takes
[1:49:02] sometimes it takes trouble Lord Jesus
[1:49:04] sometimes it takes pressure
[1:49:05] oh father but at the end of the day we
[1:49:08] come out much better Lord Jesus
[1:49:10] thank you Father
[1:49:12] change our hearts Lord and we we just
[1:49:15] want to commit ourselves into your hands
[1:49:17] and just sing unto you this little song
[1:49:19] change my heart oh Lord make it ever
[1:49:21] true
[1:49:23] because you are the Potter you you're
[1:49:25] dealing with the clay you know how to
[1:49:27] mix it you know how to mingle it you
[1:49:29] know to how to separate it you know how
[1:49:30] to put it back on the table
[1:49:32] Lord Jesus to form a vessel Lord Jesus
[1:49:36] that would be a vessel of Honor for you
[1:49:38] oh and we just love you Lord we just
[1:49:41] want to say you you're wonderful and I
[1:49:43] thank you for the wonderful audience
[1:49:45] Lord Jesus that
[1:49:46] Lord Jesus had this great pool in their

[1:54:16] it's it's simple and expression but it's
[1:54:20] deep
[1:54:21] in the manifestation in our lives
[1:54:24] and it makes us as a people so thankful
[1:54:26] for the things that God has done to us
[1:54:29] to mold this Revelation and mix it into
[1:54:31] our lives things that make other people

[1:55:26] this reality in my life I see it I want
[1:55:29] to see it more I've seen it in the past

[1:59:44] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[1:59:48] amen God bless you all we're going to
[1:59:51] let you be dismissed we're going to sing
[1:59:52] you're welcome to stay in worship and to
[1:59:54] pray
[1:59:55] and I just want to say how much I
[1:59:57] appreciate God's gifts
[1:59:59] I appreciate the variety I appreciate
[2:00:01] that God will choose different gifts
[2:00:03] with different temperaments and
[2:00:05] different styles
[2:00:06] and when brother was getting everything
[2:00:08] out from behind the desk and putting it
[2:00:10] out there's things he's touched that
[2:00:12] I've never touched
[2:00:13] [Music]
[2:00:16] it's not my temperament
[2:00:18] I believe if it's in that spot it should
[2:00:19] stay there nobody should touch it it's
[2:00:21] against the rules
[2:00:24] so when he got it all out and lined it
[2:00:26] up I'm thinking I could never do that
[2:00:28] praise God I wish I was more like that
[2:00:31] but now I see everything out and it's
[2:00:34] killing me I want to put it away so bad
[2:00:37] I'm going to have to walk away from the
[2:00:39] pulpit I'm gonna have to resist
[2:00:40] everything in my nature not to put
[2:00:42] everything back in its proper
[2:00:43] appropriate place
[2:00:45] but I'm going to overcome the Flesh and
[2:00:47] I'm going to walk away and I'm not going
[2:00:48] to touch
