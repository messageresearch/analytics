[6:03] stays in touch with us
[6:04] he lives away but he just wanted to do
[6:06] something special for all the moms so
[6:08] there's roses out there
[6:09] for every mother who would want one and
[6:12] also i want to make an announcement
[6:14] brother
[6:15] paul lafontaine sent me a text saying
[6:17] that they're starting the
[6:18] tri-state youth meetings up again so
[6:20] next
[6:21] sunday may 16th will be the first one at
[6:24] 6 00 pm
[6:25] and you're all invited to that all the
[6:27] youth that is amen
[6:29] amen god bless you all let's look at
[6:32] mark
[6:32] 16. mark 16
[6:39] and verse 9.
[6:44] now when jesus was risen early the first
[6:46] day of the week he appeared
[6:48] first to mary magdalene out of whom he
[6:50] had cast seven devils
[6:52] and she went and told them that had been
[6:55] with him
[6:55] as they mourned and wept and they when
[6:58] they had heard
[6:59] that he was alive and had been seen of
[7:01] her believe not
[7:03] after that he appeared in another form
[7:05] unto two of them
[7:06] as they walked and went into the country
[7:09] and let's just stop there and ask the
[7:11] lord to bless the reading of his word
[7:13] dear heavenly father we ask lord that
[7:14] you would bless the reading of your word
[7:17] god we can take the book and lord and in
[7:19] our physical hands read it lord with a
[7:22] an ability lord to understand the words
[7:25] but
[7:25] god only you can break the word to us
[7:28] only you can reveal it to us
[7:30] we're asking that you would come
[7:31] yourself and reveal your word to us
[7:34] and god we pray that you would open our
[7:35] eyes that we might understand and may we
[7:37] become more like you
[7:39] we ask it in jesus christ's name we pray
[7:42] amen
[7:43] you can all be seated my
[7:46] my plans have been interrupted a little
[7:48] bit i fully intended to continue on with
[7:51] the series that
[7:52] i've been enjoying so much on religion
[7:54] versus relationship
[7:56] i thought today we would come to part
[7:58] four but when i got
[8:00] friday and especially yesterday but
[8:02] started friday
[8:04] god started leaning me in another way
[8:06] and there was no option but just to
[8:08] preach amen
[8:09] and so what i want to preach on this
[8:11] sunday is i believe it'll be just an
[8:13] injection we'll preach this service i
[8:14] believe
[8:15] and then i still feel to go back to the
[8:18] series that we're on because my heart is
[8:19] still full of that subject
[8:21] but this morning i'd like to preach on
[8:23] the resurrection ministry of christ
[8:26] the resurrection ministry of christ
[8:29] because we know that there was three
[8:32] pools the
[8:33] jesus ministry there was three polls to
[8:35] brother branham's ministry and
[8:36] and we understand some of these things
[8:38] that the prophet has brought to us
[8:40] and we know there was a first and a
[8:41] second pool in the prophet's ministry
[8:43] and there was a first and a second pool
[8:45] and and jesus ministry but we also
[8:48] see that if you read the bible and we're
[8:49] going to look at this
[8:51] when you get to the resurrection
[8:52] ministry of jesus christ
[8:54] there was a change in the ministry of
[8:56] jesus christ in the resurrection
[8:59] the ministry before the resurrection was
[9:01] different looked different
[9:03] acted different than the ministry after
[9:05] the resurrection but he had a ministry
[9:07] after the resurrection
[9:08] and so i just want to take some time and
[9:10] i want to look at that
[9:12] the resurrection ministry of christ and
[9:14] and
[9:15] i want to read this uh scripture again
[9:17] and and mark 16 verse 9 it says now when
[9:19] jesus was risen
[9:20] early the first day of the week he
[9:22] appeared first to mary magdalene
[9:24] out of whom he had cast seven devils so
[9:26] we're going to get to this he first
[9:28] appeared to mary magdalene and we're
[9:29] going to look at that scripture in a
[9:31] minute
[9:31] and and she went and told them that had
[9:34] been with him as they mourned and wept
[9:36] and they when they had heard that he was
[9:38] alive and had been seen of her
[9:40] believe not after that he appeared
[9:44] in another form this is what i want you
[9:47] to catch
[9:47] after that he appeared in another form
[9:50] so the first thing we want to catch in
[9:51] the resurrection ministry of christ
[9:53] it's christ himself in another form
[9:58] amen and it was in a form that they did
[10:01] not recognize he was
[10:02] he was standing there he was walking
[10:04] with them on the road to emmaus because
[10:06] that's what the scripture is referring
[10:07] to
[10:08] and he was with them for six hours and
[10:10] more
[10:11] and in in and they were in direct
[10:13] contact he was a man and flesh
[10:15] it was jesus christ in flesh amen but he
[10:18] was in
[10:19] another form of flesh
[10:22] catch that put your spiritual jacket on
[10:24] now brother men would say
[10:26] don't let these things fly over our head
[10:28] and just be little verses in the bible
[10:30] these things are there for a reason
[10:32] and so now in the resurrection ministry
[10:34] he appeared to them
[10:36] in another form now let's look over at
[10:39] luke 24
[10:41] and this is the road to emmaus story
[10:44] that this scripture in mark is referring
[10:46] to now don't forget mary magdalene he
[10:48] appeared first to her but we'll get to
[10:50] that in a minute
[10:52] luke 24 and verse 13.
[10:58] and behold two of them went that same
[11:01] day to a village called emmaus
[11:03] which was from jerusalem about three
[11:06] score
[11:06] furlongs and brother brown tells us that
[11:08] that three score furlongs is about six
[11:10] miles
[11:13] three score furlongs and they they
[11:15] talked together
[11:16] of of all these things which had
[11:18] happened
[11:19] and it came to pass that while they
[11:21] communed together
[11:22] in reason uh reason jesus himself drew
[11:26] near
[11:27] and went with them but their eyes were
[11:29] holding that they should not
[11:30] know him why because mark says he came
[11:33] in another form
[11:35] it was jesus the bible says it was jesus
[11:38] amen but it was jesus in another form
[11:40] and their eyes were holding that they
[11:42] would not know him
[11:43] so in the resurrection ministry jesus
[11:46] comes
[11:46] and i want to i want to look at this too
[11:49] pre
[11:50] the pre-resurrection ministry amen jesus
[11:53] had a very
[11:54] public ministry the first and second
[11:57] pool were a very public ministry
[11:59] he would feed five thousand he would
[12:01] speak to multitudes he would heal
[12:02] all that were sick in the city and they
[12:04] would bring him from all the country
[12:06] round about to be healed
[12:07] amen the pre-resurrection ministry was a
[12:10] very public ministry
[12:12] amen but the post-resurrection ministry
[12:14] was a
[12:15] private ministry because the third pool
[12:18] won't be
[12:19] a public show so in the resurrection
[12:22] ministry of jesus christ
[12:24] it was not a public show amen but it was
[12:27] to the elect
[12:29] and we know in the third pool he went
[12:30] down to souls that were in prison now he
[12:32] went down to hell and preached to them
[12:34] and showed that they were forever
[12:36] condemned because they rejected the word
[12:38] in their day
[12:38] and now comes the fullness of the word
[12:40] that would have brought them redemption
[12:42] if they would have accepted the part of
[12:44] the word that they had in their day
[12:45] but by rejecting the part of the word
[12:47] that was manifest in their day
[12:49] they had rejected him he come the
[12:51] fullness that they saw in portion
[12:54] all of that collected together in
[12:55] fullness and now he paid the price of
[12:57] atonement
[12:58] and he comes down and he tells them
[13:00] you're condemned for rejecting
[13:02] they weren't rejecting jesus christ as a
[13:05] son of man
[13:06] nailed to a cross they were rejecting
[13:08] that part of the word that they faced in
[13:10] their day
[13:14] and they didn't get a second chance
[13:18] he came down to preach the souls that
[13:20] were in prison now
[13:23] and then he came back to his disciples
[13:27] and it wasn't a public show this time
[13:31] it was a behind closed doors
[13:34] private ministry
[13:39] i'm hoping that as we go through this
[13:41] we'll see our day
[13:43] and begin to recognize the third pool
[13:45] that we're
[13:47] so jesus himself drew near and went with
[13:50] them but their eyes were
[13:51] holden that they should not know him and
[13:54] he said unto them
[13:55] what manner of communications are these
[13:58] that you have
[13:59] one to another as you walk and are sad
[14:02] and the one of them whose name was
[14:04] cleopas answered said unto him
[14:06] art thou only a stranger in jerusalem
[14:07] and has not known
[14:09] the things which are come to pass there
[14:11] in these days
[14:13] and he said unto them what things and
[14:15] they said unto him concerning jesus of
[14:17] nazareth which was a prophet mighty
[14:19] indeed in word before god
[14:21] and all the people and how the chief
[14:23] priest and our
[14:24] and our rulers delivered him to be
[14:26] condemned to death
[14:27] and have crucified him but we trusted
[14:29] that it had been
[14:31] he which should redeem israel he was
[14:33] saying we trusted but he wasn't saying
[14:35] that he was still trusting
[14:38] they had they had trusted amen
[14:41] that it would be that it would be he
[14:44] which should have redeemed israel and
[14:45] beside all this today is the third day
[14:47] since these things were done
[14:49] yea and certain women also of our
[14:51] company made us astonished
[14:52] which were early at the sepulcher and
[14:54] when they found not his body they came
[14:56] saying that they
[14:58] that they had also seen a vision of
[15:01] angels which had
[15:02] said that he was alive and certain of
[15:05] them
[15:05] which were with us went to the sepulcher
[15:07] and found it even as the woman
[15:10] had said the women had said but him they
[15:13] saw not
[15:14] then he said unto them o fools and slow
[15:17] of heart to believe all that the
[15:19] prophets have spoken
[15:21] ought not christ to have suffered these
[15:23] things and to entered into his glory
[15:26] and beginning at moses and all the
[15:28] prophets
[15:30] this is a long sermon
[15:33] i think i think that jesus could have
[15:36] said
[15:37] i take for my context the entire bible
[15:42] i think he could have said that amen
[15:45] does that sound familiar
[15:48] and beginning at moses and all the
[15:49] prophets expounded to them
[15:51] in all the scriptures the things
[15:53] concerning
[15:54] himself what was he doing he was opening
[15:56] the mystery of the old testament
[16:01] and they drew nigh into the village
[16:02] whether they went and he made his dough
[16:04] he would have gone further
[16:06] but they constrained him saying abide
[16:08] with us for it is
[16:10] toward evening and the day is far spent
[16:12] and he went in to tarry with them
[16:15] and it came to pass as he said at meet
[16:17] with them he took
[16:18] bread and blessed it and break and gave
[16:21] to them
[16:22] and their eyes were opened and they knew
[16:25] him
[16:25] and he vanished out of their sights so
[16:28] now
[16:29] in the resurrection ministry
[16:33] now this is this is so critical just
[16:35] just
[16:36] oh if we could just get rid of
[16:38] everything we ever thought we knew amen
[16:40] and just take a fresh look amen in the
[16:42] resurrection ministry
[16:44] he now comes to them in another form and
[16:46] he comes and he begins to walk with them
[16:49] and he's questioning them why they're so
[16:51] sad and what's happening and they begin
[16:52] to ask and they just begin to explain to
[16:54] him the situation
[16:56] in their situation they have no
[16:58] understanding
[16:59] of the word for their day
[17:02] they said we thought it was going to be
[17:04] the fulfillment of this scripture and
[17:05] they didn't fully
[17:06] understand the scripture so what jesus
[17:09] begins to do
[17:10] is he begins to preach out of them the
[17:13] mystery of the old testament
[17:15] and and for his text he takes the entire
[17:17] old testament
[17:19] and as they walk along the road he
[17:21] preaches it but moses and all the
[17:22] prophets all the scriptures concerning
[17:24] himself
[17:25] amen and and he preaches this and they
[17:27] still don't know who he is
[17:29] amen so now in the resurrection ministry
[17:33] jesus now comes in another form
[17:36] a form of a man a form of a human being
[17:39] amen but they don't recognize the form
[17:41] and in this form he begins to preach
[17:44] out of the word
[17:49] and he begins to break the word he
[17:52] begins to take the word
[17:54] and lay in the bible and begins to apply
[17:56] it to the day that they're living in
[17:58] and so now in the resurrection ministry
[18:01] jesus christ will come in another form
[18:04] and
[18:04] preach the word and so now
[18:08] we wonder what what what is all this
[18:10] about and what's going on
[18:11] and what's going on all around us it's
[18:13] the resurrection ministry
[18:15] and it's jesus christ in another form
[18:18] and he's come in the form of a preacher
[18:20] of a five-fold ministry
[18:21] and he's taking all of the scriptures
[18:24] and all of the prophets
[18:25] concerning the day in which you live and
[18:28] they're beginning to preach it
[18:29] and what is it it's jesus christ in
[18:32] another form
[18:34] and what the resurrection ministry
[18:37] because in the resurrection ministry
[18:39] he can preach the whole bible
[18:43] he can go back through the entire thing
[18:46] and take
[18:47] all of those scriptures and bring them
[18:48] to the mystery that is being revealed
[18:51] right before their eyes
[18:55] and then this is the resurrection
[18:57] ministry
[18:59] then when they get to their place that
[19:01] they're they're traveling to
[19:03] he acts as though he's going to go on
[19:07] and they constrain him to come in
[19:11] because in the resurrection ministry
[19:14] you have to invite him in
[19:19] and when he comes in to them to commune
[19:22] with them
[19:23] privately he breaks the bread
[19:28] and when he breaks the bread breaking
[19:30] the bread has everything to do with
[19:31] feeding the sheep amen with breaking the
[19:33] word when he breaks the bread
[19:36] then their eyes were open they
[19:38] recognized
[19:39] this is him and they recognized him in
[19:42] the way he broke the bread
[19:47] and so they knew him and he vanished out
[19:50] of their sight
[19:52] oh this is so good he vanished out of
[19:56] their sight
[19:57] because this wasn't the ministry the
[20:00] resurrection ministry
[20:02] is not going to be the ministry where
[20:04] jesus christ
[20:05] stays right beside you and does
[20:06] everything for you this is where jesus
[20:08] christ comes in you
[20:10] and begins to flow through you all he's
[20:11] got to do is bring you to the word
[20:17] amen and don't misunderstand what i'm
[20:20] saying
[20:20] just hang with me and i think you'll see
[20:22] what he's trying to bring them to the
[20:24] word
[20:25] amen then when they recognize that was
[20:26] him he leaves
[20:28] why does he leave amen because he
[20:30] already opened the mystery of the old
[20:32] testament to them
[20:36] and then he leaves do you know how
[20:40] disappointing that would feel
[20:43] they were walking sad because their
[20:45] master their friend their teacher the
[20:47] one whom they loved
[20:48] had been crucified and now they found
[20:50] out that his body was missing and there
[20:52] were stories floating around
[20:53] of visions of angels and they can't find
[20:55] his body and they're so distraught
[20:57] and now they they have him come in
[20:58] another form but they don't know it's
[21:00] him but this man
[21:01] begins to preach in such a way amen they
[21:03] begin to recognize
[21:04] that this is the truth that this was
[21:06] jesus christ he was the messiah for real
[21:08] we weren't wrong
[21:09] it was right it was true amen and then
[21:11] he breaks the bread
[21:12] and they say that's him and then he
[21:14] leaves
[21:17] and now we're going to start to realize
[21:19] what is the point of the resurrection
[21:21] ministry
[21:26] and the point of the resurrection
[21:27] ministry is to get the word to the elect
[21:32] verse 32 and they said one to another
[21:36] did not our heart burn within us while
[21:39] he talked with us by the way
[21:41] and while he opened to us the scriptures
[21:45] they rose up the same hour and returned
[21:48] to jerusalem
[21:49] and found the eleven gathered together
[21:51] in them
[21:52] that were with them saying the lord has
[21:54] risen indeed and hath appeared to simon
[21:56] and they told what things were done in
[21:58] the way and how he was known of them
[22:01] in breaking of bread so now we find out
[22:05] that
[22:05] that now that they are walking ah
[22:09] they're walking in a six mile and
[22:11] brother ben calls it a six
[22:13] hour journey so it's it's 60 furlongs
[22:16] about six miles amen and brother bam
[22:19] saying
[22:19] it was about six hours and they're
[22:21] traveling and so everything is pointing
[22:23] to the fact
[22:24] that they're traveling through the
[22:25] through the six church ages amen
[22:28] so now they're moving away from
[22:29] jerusalem they're moving away from the
[22:31] origin
[22:32] of the church and they're traveling away
[22:35] for
[22:35] six miles they're traveling away for six
[22:38] hours
[22:38] amen for six church ages they're
[22:40] traveling away
[22:41] but in the seventh church age he's going
[22:44] to come
[22:45] in another form he's actually going to
[22:49] come at the end of the six
[22:51] and they're going to find out it was him
[22:53] all the way through
[22:55] and now he's going to come and in the
[22:58] seventh hour because they walk six hours
[23:01] amen but the seventh hour was inside now
[23:03] and in the seventh hour
[23:05] he breaks bread and the way he broke the
[23:08] bread
[23:09] brother man says he did it the way he
[23:11] did it before
[23:15] and when brother branham was here amen
[23:16] in his ministry was proving
[23:18] that he was doing what christ did before
[23:22] and when he broke the bread and he did
[23:24] it in such a way
[23:25] that they knew it was him amen and then
[23:28] he vanished
[23:29] and they said did not our hearts burn
[23:31] within us when he spoke to us along the
[23:33] way
[23:33] amen and they and then the same hour
[23:35] they ran back to jerusalem
[23:37] so six church ages they move away but in
[23:40] the seventh behind the closed door
[23:42] amen they have a private interview with
[23:44] jesus christ
[23:45] who breaks the bread in such a way they
[23:48] recognize
[23:49] that it's not a preacher amen it's not a
[23:51] six hour sermon anymore
[23:53] now it's christ jesus breaking the bread
[23:57] and when he breaks the bread in the same
[23:59] hour they return to jerusalem they go
[24:01] right
[24:01] back to the church they were supposed to
[24:03] be in the original
[24:05] all this speaks of the seven church ages
[24:09] then they began to tell them what had
[24:11] happened
[24:14] and as they just spake jesus himself
[24:16] stood in the midst of them and saith
[24:18] unto them
[24:18] peace be unto you but they were
[24:21] terrified and
[24:22] frightened and supposed that they had
[24:23] seen a spirit and he said unto them why
[24:26] are you troubled and why do thoughts
[24:28] arise in your hearts
[24:29] behold my hands my feet which it is i
[24:32] myself handle me and see for a spirit
[24:34] hath not flesh
[24:36] and bones as you see me have and when he
[24:39] had thus spoken he showed them his hands
[24:40] and his feet
[24:41] and while they yet believed not for joy
[24:44] and wondered he said unto them
[24:46] have you hear any meat and they gave him
[24:48] a piece of broad fish and of a honeycomb
[24:51] and he took it and did eat before them
[24:54] and he said unto them these are the
[24:57] words which i
[24:58] spake unto you while i was yet with you
[25:00] that
[25:01] all these things must be fulfilled which
[25:03] were written in the law of moses
[25:04] and in the prophets and in the psalms
[25:06] concerning me
[25:08] then opened he their understanding
[25:12] that they might understand the
[25:15] scriptures
[25:17] so in the resurrection ministry first
[25:21] he will open the scriptures
[25:24] then he will open your understanding to
[25:28] understand
[25:29] the scriptures i want you to see
[25:32] that this listen this
[25:35] is the resurrection ministry amen
[25:38] because before
[25:39] when he was in the first two pools he
[25:40] was preaching in parables
[25:42] and he was talking scriptures and he was
[25:43] talking parables amen and
[25:45] even the disciples didn't fully
[25:48] understand what he was preaching
[25:51] amen they just they knew it was the word
[25:53] they knew it was right and he was
[25:54] preaching in parables and he was
[25:56] preaching in mysteries and he was
[25:57] speaking the word and he was contending
[25:59] with the false religion and
[26:00] he was doing the signs of the messiah he
[26:02] was doing all that but now when we get
[26:04] to the resurrection ministry
[26:05] amen now we get to the to the ministry
[26:08] to the elect
[26:08] now he opens the scriptures
[26:13] and he opens their understanding to
[26:16] understand the scriptures
[26:18] and now something begins to change
[26:22] in the disciples because now they they
[26:24] saw the signs they saw the ones they
[26:26] were attracted
[26:26] amen to the messiah but now he begins to
[26:29] open the mystery that had been laying in
[26:31] the bible
[26:32] and so that they would understand the
[26:34] mystery because he's got to point them
[26:36] to the word
[26:39] listen he's got to point the disciples
[26:41] to the word
[26:42] because he is the word made flesh but
[26:45] his dispensation now was going to change
[26:48] amen
[26:48] and they had to catch the change and in
[26:51] order to catch the change
[26:52] they had to have confidence when they
[26:54] could no longer go to jesus and wake him
[26:56] up in the back of the boat and ask him a
[26:58] question and have him
[26:59] explain now they were under the ministry
[27:01] of the holy ghost amen the holy ghost
[27:03] anointing them
[27:04] to understand the mystery that jesus had
[27:06] unlocked to them
[27:09] and now he had to put confidence in the
[27:11] word because now all the answers are
[27:13] going to come from the word
[27:18] in the resurrection ministry
[27:22] he's going to open the scriptures and
[27:24] open their understanding of the
[27:26] scriptures
[27:26] and he's going to send them to the word
[27:28] because now from here on
[27:30] they're going to get all their answers
[27:32] out of the word
[27:36] praise be to god
[27:42] let's look at this quote
[27:46] and go tell my disciples from 1953 he
[27:49] said there was a couple by the name one
[27:50] of cleopas and so forth
[27:52] they was on the road to emmaus and they
[27:53] were going along sad
[27:55] hearted broken and they were going along
[27:56] talking about it oh how bad it was and
[27:59] all of a sudden
[28:00] someone stepped out of the bush as an
[28:01] ordinary man not his collar turned
[28:03] around or any different dress
[28:07] are you catching it
[28:10] he dressed like the rest of man he wore
[28:12] his hair and his beard just like the
[28:13] rest of them
[28:14] it wasn't any different he didn't make
[28:16] any great difference his life proved
[28:18] what his credentials what he was
[28:20] and that's what god wants us to be wants
[28:22] our life to prove
[28:23] our credentials he comes in the message
[28:26] events made clear by prophecy
[28:28] i want you to understand brother branham
[28:30] is preaching events made clear by
[28:32] prophecy
[28:33] he also titles that modern events made
[28:35] clear by prophecy when he preaches
[28:36] another time
[28:37] and brother madam is trying to get the
[28:39] people to see
[28:40] the modern events taking place around
[28:43] them make clear by prophecy
[28:46] so brother ben was not preaching a
[28:48] historical teaching here
[28:50] he's not trying to take us to go back
[28:52] and look at something back in the bible
[28:54] he's trying to take the bible and to
[28:56] unlock to open the scriptures
[29:00] so you can see the prophecy for your day
[29:05] in an event made clear by prophecy he
[29:07] says now notice now quickly now don't
[29:09] miss this now
[29:10] here is the text how jesus made himself
[29:13] known to those disciples that he was
[29:15] their messiah
[29:17] now think about what he said he said
[29:20] don't miss this now
[29:23] here is the text how jesus made himself
[29:26] known
[29:26] to these two disciples that he was their
[29:29] messiah
[29:31] don't miss this this is how jesus
[29:34] teaches his disciples that he's the
[29:36] messiah
[29:39] and he wasn't going to heal them
[29:44] they weren't going to see a visible
[29:46] pillar of fire
[29:50] he was going to open to them the
[29:52] scriptures
[29:54] to prove to them he was the messiah
[30:03] now all eyes this way brother bennett
[30:06] says
[30:07] that's interesting and out in the land
[30:10] don't miss this now we've tried to tell
[30:12] you that the bible is the word of god
[30:14] wrote by god himself through the lips
[30:15] and instrumentality of man
[30:17] god can write himself so i'm going to
[30:20] pull several quotes
[30:21] out of a this is a long quote but i'm
[30:22] pulling segments out of it out of events
[30:24] made clear by prophecy
[30:25] he goes on to say now notice how jesus
[30:28] the word
[30:29] made these two heartbroke disciples know
[30:31] he was their messiah
[30:33] the question is how did he make them
[30:36] know that he was their messiah he came
[30:39] in another form
[30:40] and their eyes were holding to who he
[30:42] was so how would he
[30:44] identify his presence how would he
[30:47] identify who he is
[30:48] amen the way he would identify it is he
[30:50] would begin at moses and with all the
[30:52] prophets
[30:53] he would speak all the scriptures
[30:54] concerning himself
[30:57] he would show them amen he would show
[31:00] him
[31:00] by the word amen and then they would
[31:02] take the word
[31:03] and and then when he got behind closed
[31:05] doors he would do
[31:06] something like he did before and then he
[31:09] would break the bread in such a way
[31:11] that they knew only he can break the
[31:13] bread like that
[31:15] nobody else can break the bread like
[31:17] that only the messiah can break the
[31:19] bread like that
[31:20] amen it wasn't brother branham who
[31:22] opened those seals only the lamb can
[31:24] take the book and only the lamb can
[31:26] break that bread
[31:27] amen and he come in our day and he broke
[31:29] bread like
[31:30] no man could break bread there's only
[31:33] one that can break the bread like that
[31:36] there's only one that could break those
[31:38] seals and that's the lamb and that
[31:39] wasn't brother branham that was
[31:41] jesus christ that was the one who broke
[31:44] those seals
[31:46] and he broke the bread in such a way
[31:48] amen that you said
[31:50] that's him that's the messiah
[31:56] this is how he makes his presence known
[32:00] notice how jesus the word made these two
[32:02] heartbroken disciples know he was their
[32:03] messiah
[32:04] the messiah the promised word notice
[32:07] what he done
[32:08] he appealed to prophecy full slowed to
[32:11] believe all that the prophets wrote
[32:12] now he never said well what does the
[32:15] church say about it
[32:18] notice how he approached the subject he
[32:20] never come right out and said
[32:22] i'm your messiah he could have done it
[32:25] for he was but notice he identified
[32:28] himself in the word
[32:30] then they would know listen this is the
[32:33] resurrection ministry of jesus christ
[32:35] the resurrecting ministry of jesus
[32:37] christ did not stand up and say
[32:38] i'm the messiah i look at the pillar of
[32:41] fire come to me
[32:42] the mid the resurrection ministry of
[32:44] jesus christ and the third pool to his
[32:46] elect
[32:47] came and he broke the word to them and
[32:49] he broke the bread in such a way
[32:50] they knew nobody else there's nobody
[32:53] that can break bread that like that
[32:57] and he identified it was him
[33:04] he could have done it for he was but
[33:06] notice he identified himself
[33:07] in the word then they would know
[33:11] if he'd have said it he would have said
[33:13] that that and it would have
[33:15] been so but when he went and began to
[33:17] speak on the prophets about him
[33:19] and they seen it then they could tell
[33:22] themselves
[33:23] if they were god's children
[33:27] he didn't come out and directly say it
[33:29] he just showed it in the word
[33:31] and if they're god's children they could
[33:33] catch it
[33:36] but called their attention to what the
[33:38] prophets had foretold and said to look
[33:40] for
[33:41] in the time that the messiah his age
[33:43] would be manifested
[33:44] he as john let the word the bible
[33:47] identify their message
[33:49] here he never changes his way of doing
[33:52] it
[33:53] never has changed this is the
[33:56] resurrection ministry
[33:57] he's never changed his way of doing it
[33:59] it never has
[34:00] changed so the thing is do you want to
[34:04] see jesus today
[34:07] look for him in the resurrection
[34:08] ministry
[34:13] he never changed his way of doing it
[34:14] never has changed he never can change
[34:16] because he's the unchanging god see
[34:18] notice he went right
[34:20] back to those two disciples cleopas and
[34:21] his friend on the road to emmaus and
[34:23] said
[34:23] appealed to the scriptures to them said
[34:26] why are you so foolish to not believe
[34:28] that every word the prophets wrote
[34:29] concerning the messiah would have to be
[34:31] fulfilled
[34:32] oh what a day john did the same thing
[34:35] search the scriptures look back and said
[34:37] there'd be a voice of one crying in the
[34:39] wilderness where did i come from see
[34:41] that's that should have made it plain to
[34:43] them right
[34:44] should make it plain today and the thing
[34:46] that we see the holy spirit doing
[34:48] he once said search the scriptures he
[34:50] wants us to do it today
[34:53] he wants to do the same thing today it
[34:56] was now beginning to soak into them
[34:58] he had done told them they were fools
[35:00] for not looking at the prophecy
[35:02] for that day and now it begin to soak in
[35:04] begin to see the fulfilling of all this
[35:06] that had taken place in the last few
[35:08] days
[35:09] in the last two or three years the
[35:11] vindicated prophecy of the age it was
[35:13] then
[35:13] that they knew that their crucified
[35:15] friend jesus had fulfilled
[35:16] every word of this oh it was then that
[35:19] they know that that man
[35:21] truly was that messiah what identified
[35:24] it
[35:25] the word the word coming into
[35:28] fulfillment the word being made manifest
[35:30] is what identified it
[35:34] that man truly was the messiah that he
[35:36] should raise from the dead the grave
[35:38] couldn't hold him
[35:39] i will not suffer my holy one to see
[35:41] corruption there's not one word of
[35:42] prophecy can ever fail and he did raise
[35:45] then that messenger's down at the tomb
[35:47] this morning was right
[35:49] he is risen from the dead he is alive he
[35:51] is that messiah
[35:52] why don't fail it his action his
[35:55] ministry and everything he's done
[35:56] has been vindicated exactly the words
[35:59] that the prophet said would take place
[36:00] for this day
[36:02] that's done it then they know that it
[36:05] was him
[36:05] their crucified friend jesus that had
[36:08] done it no wonder their hearts burned
[36:10] within them as he talked to them
[36:11] now they had walked six miles and it
[36:14] seemed like a short time
[36:16] and here's another thing they had done
[36:18] you know they had heard a six-hour
[36:20] sermon
[36:21] on prophecy being vindicated
[36:24] brother branham preached a six hour
[36:26] sermon called spoken word is the
[36:27] original seed
[36:30] so they had heard a six hour sermon
[36:33] and so see
[36:37] in the resurrection ministry jesus come
[36:40] in another form
[36:41] i just like to say it this way so that
[36:43] we can understand he come in the form of
[36:45] a preacher
[36:51] and he began to preach to them a sermon
[36:55] on fulfilled prophecy
[36:59] and he took the whole bible
[37:02] for his text
[37:05] that's what he talked to them along the
[37:07] road just as soon as they started down
[37:09] the road he stepped out
[37:10] for he was right there at jerusalem six
[37:13] hours later 60 furlongs
[37:15] they was right down the road six miles
[37:17] to emmaus that's what it is
[37:19] and he had preached confirmed the
[37:20] prophecy for six hours
[37:22] don't condemn me on my three then see
[37:25] but notice they had preached they had
[37:27] heard a six-hour sermon on prophecy
[37:29] being confirmed
[37:29] vindicated now i was getting along
[37:32] towards evening time you know
[37:33] he's the same yesterday today and
[37:35] forever
[37:36] why did he say that because this is the
[37:39] evening time
[37:41] it's getting along towards evening time
[37:43] and brother brennaman just he's the same
[37:45] yesterday today and forever
[37:46] because brother branham does not want
[37:47] you to leave this in luke 24 he wants
[37:50] you to bring it right to the day that he
[37:51] was at
[37:54] he's the same yesterday today and
[37:55] forever at the evening time events are
[37:57] made clear
[37:58] by the prophecy
[38:02] what's taking place in the modern hour
[38:05] can be easily identified if you'll just
[38:07] believe the prophecy of the hour
[38:11] yes full slow of understanding slow to
[38:13] believe you keep pondering over it to
[38:15] believe
[38:15] that all the prophets said about the
[38:17] messiah wouldn't have to happen
[38:19] now he checked these points all back and
[38:21] showed what the prophet said
[38:22] that would happen then they begin to
[38:24] understand so he said
[38:26] act like he was going to go on by they
[38:29] liked this man
[38:30] they said you've given us something we
[38:32] never thought that he is alive somewhere
[38:35] they was talking to him and didn't know
[38:37] it
[38:39] and no doubt he looked at them sadly and
[38:41] he started to walk on by
[38:43] but he was waiting for them to invite
[38:45] him
[38:46] that's what he's waiting tonight for you
[38:48] to invite him
[38:51] oh friends amen listen their hearts were
[38:54] burning within them as he talked to them
[38:56] along the way
[38:57] what was making their hearts burn amen
[38:59] it was modern events made clear by
[39:01] prophecy
[39:02] it was the preaching amen it was jesus
[39:04] christ in a form that
[39:06] another form a form they didn't
[39:08] recognize and he was in the form of a
[39:10] preacher
[39:11] taking the word and bringing the word to
[39:13] the modern day
[39:15] he was taking the prophecy and
[39:16] explaining the situation in their life
[39:18] explaining what was going on all around
[39:20] them by the prophecy
[39:22] and their hearts were burning within
[39:23] them i'm telling you if you've sat here
[39:26] in this church in that same condition
[39:28] then it's time for you to invite him in
[39:31] if your heart's burning under the
[39:32] preaching of the word amen it's not a
[39:34] man
[39:35] in the pulpit it's jesus christ working
[39:37] through the offices that he put into a
[39:38] church
[39:40] and he's here what's he here doing he's
[39:43] here taking
[39:44] the entire bible amen from moses all the
[39:47] way through to revelation
[39:48] and what he's doing he's explaining the
[39:50] events that are all around us
[39:52] going on in your life going on in my
[39:54] life going on in the world he's doing it
[39:56] by the prophecy
[39:57] and our hearts are burning within us but
[39:59] he's waiting for you to invite him in
[40:09] it's not about a good sermon
[40:13] it's not about a good sermon or a good
[40:15] day at church
[40:16] i i like that preacher that was a good
[40:18] sermon
[40:22] go to church we've heard a good sermon
[40:24] today we heard the word
[40:26] we go out we have a meal we start back
[40:28] over on monday
[40:31] that's not the point
[40:34] he's here the presence of the bridegroom
[40:38] is here
[40:40] if all we heard was a good sermon and it
[40:42] was exciting
[40:43] and we went and ate and we had some
[40:44] fellowship and we went back monday and
[40:46] did the same thing
[40:47] amen we missed the whole point because
[40:49] he's come in another form
[40:51] he's in the form of his bride and that
[40:53] bride has a fightful ministry
[40:55] amen and it's him it's got to be him and
[40:57] he's here and what's he doing
[40:59] he's taking the prophecy for the day and
[41:02] he's beginning to reveal
[41:04] modern events by prophecy
[41:07] he's taking the whole bible and using
[41:09] the whole bible to show them the mystery
[41:11] that has been revealed in their day
[41:15] and their hearts were burning within
[41:16] them amen but he's
[41:18] never he's a gentleman and he's never
[41:20] going to force himself upon them
[41:22] their hearts were burning they were
[41:23] awakening to the realization they were
[41:25] getting excited amen and when it came
[41:27] time
[41:28] he wanted to come in to commune with
[41:32] them but he's a gentleman
[41:35] so he's going to walk by
[41:40] and he's waiting for them to say
[41:43] won't you come inside
[41:51] won't you come in
[41:56] and they constrained him
[41:59] to come in and why
[42:02] they say it is now late and the day is
[42:04] far spent
[42:07] i'm telling you it is late and the day
[42:10] is far spans
[42:12] we are at the end of the end of the end
[42:15] of the end it is late and the day is far
[42:18] spent
[42:19] don't let him walk on by amen don't let
[42:22] him make your heart burn
[42:23] don't let him take all this time in his
[42:25] preaching of his word to connect the
[42:27] dots so you can have an excitement and
[42:29] enthusiasm
[42:30] and then let him walk on by it's time to
[42:33] say would you come and commune with me
[42:35] and constrain him to come in and say no
[42:38] you've got to come in you've got to stay
[42:40] here it's the day is far
[42:42] spent it is late and the day is far
[42:44] spent you've got to come here
[42:50] when you come in on a private communion
[42:53] in the house then he broke
[42:56] a revelation
[43:00] and when he broke a revelation privately
[43:03] to them
[43:05] not a public show not a public work
[43:10] when he broke a revelation privately to
[43:12] them
[43:13] now they knew who had been preaching
[43:15] that morning
[43:19] they knew it was him it was him
[43:24] notice when these disciples invited him
[43:26] in their fellowship around the table
[43:28] it was then that he'd done something
[43:30] just like he did before his crucifixion
[43:33] and their eyes come open they knowed his
[43:36] manner
[43:37] his style they knowed what he'd done oh
[43:40] just
[43:40] catch that friends they knowed his
[43:43] manner
[43:43] they knowed his style they knowed what
[43:47] he'd done
[43:48] and he did it then just like he did
[43:50] before and they said
[43:51] that's him and quickly they raised up to
[43:55] scream it out and he vanished
[43:57] and there they took six hours to listen
[43:59] to a sermon maybe 20 minutes they were
[44:00] light-footed back to tell the rest of
[44:02] them
[44:02] he is risen indeed he is really alive
[44:06] friends this is the fulfillment of
[44:08] malachi 4
[44:10] saint luke 17 saint john 15. also many
[44:12] revelations 10
[44:13] so many prophecies that can be pinned
[44:15] exactly to this day
[44:18] brother brethren was saying all of those
[44:20] things about the road to
[44:22] a mass so that the people would
[44:23] understand that the same thing's
[44:25] happening right in front of you
[44:26] he preached a six hour sermon don't get
[44:28] after me for my three
[44:32] he's still preaching through the
[44:33] preacher amen it's still him in another
[44:36] form in his third pool ministry not a
[44:38] public show
[44:39] amen he wants to come in to your
[44:41] dwelling he wants to have a communion
[44:43] with you
[44:43] amen and if your heart is burning amen
[44:46] say come
[44:47] come lord jesus commune with me
[44:51] and let him break the bread in a way
[44:53] that you know it's him
[44:56] but brother branham ends this he said
[44:58] friends
[45:00] it's the fulfillment of malachi 4.
[45:04] luke 17 saint john 15 oh so many
[45:07] revelations 10.
[45:09] i am showing them the prophecy for their
[45:12] day
[45:13] i want you to turn with me to revelation
[45:17] chapter 10
[45:28] revelation chapter 10.
[45:34] and verse 7 but in the days of the voice
[45:37] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[45:39] to sound
[45:40] the mystery of god should be finished as
[45:43] he had declared to his servants
[45:44] the prophets
[45:47] we believe that brother branham was
[45:50] preaching the fulfillment of that in his
[45:52] day
[45:54] but i want to continue reading the
[45:56] scriptures
[45:58] and it said in verse 8 and the voice
[46:00] which i heard from heaven spake unto me
[46:02] again and said go and take the little
[46:04] book
[46:05] which is in the open hand of the angel
[46:07] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[46:08] earth
[46:09] now he's speaking to john and john is
[46:11] the type of the bride
[46:13] and he went into the angel and said unto
[46:15] him give me the little book
[46:16] and he said unto him take it eat it up
[46:19] and it shall make thy belly bitter but
[46:21] it shall be in thy mouth
[46:22] sweet as honey and i took the little
[46:24] book out of the angel's hand and ate it
[46:26] up
[46:27] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[46:28] and as soon as i had eaten it
[46:30] my belly was bitter and he said unto me
[46:33] thou must
[46:34] prophesy again before many peoples
[46:37] and nations and tongues and kings
[46:43] i just want to say this day this
[46:46] scripture
[46:47] is being fulfilled
[46:52] the book has been opened the mighty
[46:53] angel has come down he's tore the seals
[46:56] off and then he's given it to the
[46:57] messenger of the age he's given it out
[46:58] to the bride
[46:59] and now it's time for that bride to take
[47:02] and eat the book
[47:02] become one with the revelation of the
[47:05] mystery
[47:09] and to prophesy again
[47:13] because he has no mouth but yours
[47:16] no hands but yours no feet but yours and
[47:18] mine
[47:20] and the in the literacy and church age
[47:22] of the church book he said
[47:24] there will be a voice in the last days
[47:27] of the people of his age and that voice
[47:28] will be in the bride
[47:29] she will be the final voice to the final
[47:33] age
[47:36] there is still a resurrection ministry
[47:41] on the earth the third pull is still
[47:45] going on
[47:48] and the third pull is the opening of the
[47:49] word
[47:51] not any new word the prophet already
[47:53] opened it
[47:58] see let's turn to john chapter 20.
[48:17] john chapter 20.
[48:27] and i want to begin at verse 14.
[48:34] and when she had thus said she turned
[48:36] herself back and saw jesus standing and
[48:38] knew not
[48:39] that it was jesus this is mary we read
[48:42] this in our opening scripture he
[48:43] revealed himself first into mary
[48:45] and she had thus said she turned herself
[48:47] back and saw jesus standing and knew not
[48:49] that it was jesus
[48:50] so here he appears to her in another
[48:53] form
[48:56] this is a common theme he appeared to
[48:59] her in another form
[49:03] jesus said unto her woman why weepest
[49:06] thou
[49:07] whom seeketh thou she supposing him to
[49:10] be the gardener
[49:12] she thought that he was somebody else
[49:15] amen
[49:16] she thought that he was the gardener say
[49:17] then to him sir if thou have borne him
[49:19] hence
[49:20] tell me where thou has laid him and i
[49:22] will take him away
[49:23] jesus said unto her mary she turned
[49:26] herself and saith unto him
[49:28] rabbone which is to say master amen
[49:31] all of a sudden she she was talking to
[49:34] jesus jesus came to her in another form
[49:36] he was in a form of flesh but it was a
[49:38] form of flesh that she was not
[49:40] recognizing catch that he was in a form
[49:44] of flesh but it was a form of flesh she
[49:46] was not recognizing
[49:47] amen and she supposed him to be the
[49:49] gardener
[49:52] she thought he was the pastor
[49:56] because he comes in another form
[50:01] but then she's asking will they have
[50:03] taken my lord wherever they laid him
[50:04] just show me and i'll go get him
[50:06] and all he does is call her by name and
[50:09] when he calls her by name
[50:10] her eyes open and she says that's not
[50:13] the gardener
[50:14] that's the messiah that's jesus christ
[50:16] that's my lord
[50:17] and he reveals by calling her name amen
[50:21] he reveals
[50:22] who he is by calling her name he doesn't
[50:25] say
[50:25] i'm the messiah i'm jesus christ he
[50:28] calls her name
[50:29] he identifies her
[50:33] in identifying her he reveals who he is
[50:40] and that's why it comes in the first
[50:42] seal and brother ben said i no longer
[50:43] call you church
[50:44] but i call you bride so that you'll get
[50:46] it amen he's giving her her
[50:48] identification
[50:49] and identifying her he's revealing who
[50:52] it is behind the veil amen
[50:54] that prophet was just the veil it was
[50:56] god elohim and flesh the flesh of that
[50:59] prophet
[50:59] but it was god himself who was revealing
[51:02] you
[51:04] to you
[51:09] praise god brother bram says in
[51:12] questions and answers on the seals
[51:14] so he said no nothing will be saved only
[51:16] those whose names were put on the lamb's
[51:17] book of life before the foundation of
[51:19] the world
[51:19] jew or gentile see that's all the book
[51:22] holds the mystery
[51:23] and the book is only unfolding it now
[51:26] not
[51:26] each one's name but what the mystery of
[51:28] the book is
[51:29] while it's calling those names
[51:32] amen he's revealing the mystery of the
[51:35] book and while he's revealing the
[51:36] mystery of the book
[51:37] it's calling the names revealing the
[51:39] word for your day is calling your name
[51:41] positionally placing you telling you who
[51:43] you are revealing the mystery of the
[51:45] bible to you
[51:50] he says you understand now the book
[51:52] doesn't say now leave veil
[51:54] is to be saved in times of church age or
[51:56] ormond neville or whosoever no
[51:57] it don't say that it just shows the
[51:59] mystery unfolds the mystery of what the
[52:01] thing is
[52:02] but we ourselves by faith believe it
[52:06] he goes on to say christ is mystery god
[52:07] revealed he says now you see the seals
[52:09] when he was in his mediatorial work back
[52:11] there redeeming but someday he comes
[52:12] forth to get this book that he's
[52:14] redeemed
[52:16] and all that's in the book would be him
[52:18] for that's the believer
[52:19] the words in the book
[52:23] and the word is him oh that's the
[52:26] believer what's the believer the words
[52:27] in the book
[52:28] what's the words in the book it's the
[52:30] bible what's the bible the bible
[52:32] contains a mystery
[52:35] the bible has been sealed amen and the
[52:37] mystery has been sealed in the bible
[52:39] i mean everybody's been able to read the
[52:41] words but they haven't been able to
[52:43] understand the mystery
[52:45] it's like in the old testament they
[52:46] could read the old testament but they
[52:48] didn't understand the mystery
[52:49] and when the mystery was revealed it was
[52:51] that god would come in the form of flesh
[52:53] as his own son
[52:54] and become the sacrifice to die for all
[52:56] of mankind and they didn't know that
[52:58] that baby in the manger was the words on
[53:00] that book
[53:03] when he was standing there amen they
[53:05] didn't understand the mystery amen and
[53:07] the mystery of the new testament is the
[53:09] bride and it's been laying in the old
[53:11] testament
[53:11] the mystery of the bible is adam and his
[53:14] wife
[53:15] restored back into fellowship back to a
[53:17] garden of eden
[53:19] now mystery's been laying in that word
[53:21] and as he's revealing the mystery he's
[53:23] calling the names
[53:24] because what's the believer the words on
[53:26] the book
[53:28] because the book is about the elect it's
[53:31] about
[53:31] christ male and female and christ is the
[53:35] expression of god
[53:39] and so now the words on the book and the
[53:43] word is him
[53:44] and that's in that he come forth for
[53:46] this book of redemption
[53:47] those names are written on the book
[53:49] before the foundational world
[53:51] when he was slain as a lamb
[53:56] praise be to god
[54:00] in the resurrection ministry
[54:04] he takes the scriptures
[54:07] and he comes in another form and he
[54:09] explains the scriptures
[54:11] concerning their day and their hearts
[54:14] burn within them along the way
[54:17] then he comes in privately
[54:21] and breaks the bread and they know
[54:24] that that's our lord he does something
[54:26] the way he's done it before
[54:30] then he comes in and he reveals himself
[54:32] amen
[54:33] he reveals himself to his disciples and
[54:35] then he
[54:36] opens their understanding to understand
[54:40] the scriptures then he commissions
[54:43] them to take the revelation of the
[54:46] mystery
[54:47] out into the world
[54:52] this is the resurrection ministry
[54:56] when jesus resurrected he
[55:00] did not gather a crowd
[55:04] he did not have a campaign he did not
[55:06] have a healing service
[55:09] not in this third floor of his ministry
[55:11] was there still miracles absolutely
[55:13] amen when they when they when he told
[55:14] them to cast a net on the right side
[55:16] and they caught a load of fish even they
[55:18] had toiled all night and caught no fish
[55:19] there was still
[55:20] miracles in the third pool amen there
[55:22] was still the miraculous all around him
[55:24] but it was not a public show
[55:27] he never he didn't feed 5 000 in his
[55:30] resurrection ministry the 40 days that
[55:32] he was on earth
[55:32] he didn't feed the five thousand he
[55:34] didn't heal all that were around about
[55:36] the country that were brought unto him
[55:38] but in in that ministry in that in that
[55:41] third pool ministry in the resurrection
[55:43] ministry
[55:44] he begins to take the word and explain
[55:46] to them the day they're living and by
[55:48] the word
[55:49] amen and opens to them the scriptures
[55:51] and then opens to them their
[55:52] understanding of the scriptures
[55:54] and he calls mary's name and in calling
[55:57] her name
[55:58] he opens her eyes to who he is
[56:02] you see how the resurrection ministry
[56:04] was different than the first and second
[56:06] pool
[56:13] praise god it was different for a reason
[56:20] now he wanted them to catch the word
[56:23] because he needed them to become the
[56:25] manifestation
[56:27] of that word and now
[56:30] they by catching the word amen and
[56:33] receiving the spirit of god
[56:35] that would quicken that word that's in
[56:36] them to life now they would catch that
[56:39] mystery
[56:39] and they would go forth and now they
[56:41] would be the light of the world
[56:46] let's go to john 21 the gospel of john
[56:51] chapter 21
[56:55] in verse 1.
[57:00] after these things jesus showed himself
[57:02] again to the disciples at the sea of
[57:04] tiberias
[57:05] and on this wise on this why showed he
[57:08] himself
[57:09] they were together simon peter and
[57:11] thomas called didymus and nathanael cana
[57:13] and galilee and the sons of zebedee and
[57:15] two others
[57:16] his disciples simon peter saith unto
[57:20] them
[57:20] i go fishing they say unto him we also
[57:23] go with thee
[57:24] they went forth and entered into a ship
[57:26] immediately and that night
[57:27] they caught nothing but when the morning
[57:29] was now come jesus stood on the shore
[57:32] stood on the shore but the disciples
[57:33] knew not that it was jesus
[57:35] then jesus said unto them children have
[57:37] you any meat they answered him
[57:39] no and he said unto them cast the net
[57:42] on the right side of the ship and you
[57:44] shall find they cast therefore
[57:46] and now they were not able to draw it
[57:48] for multitude of fishes
[57:51] i mean there's several ways you can look
[57:52] at this but i just think it's
[57:54] interesting
[57:55] that jesus when he refers to the
[57:57] catching of fish he's saying
[57:58] children have you any meat
[58:02] what is the children's meat what is a
[58:05] it's the word we live off the word
[58:09] and they've toiled all night by
[58:10] themselves and they
[58:12] have caught nothing but
[58:15] jesus when he stands and when he begins
[58:18] to direct and he says
[58:19] cast thy net on the right side he asked
[58:22] did you catch
[58:23] any meat do you have any food
[58:27] he said no we've tried we've read the
[58:29] bible all night long and read it through
[58:31] and
[58:33] we're fishermen amen we're preachers
[58:36] we've been the civilian there we've done
[58:38] this our whole life
[58:42] we're professionals at catching meat
[58:46] we've been trained by our daddy all of
[58:49] our life generationally
[58:50] we are preachers we're good at catching
[58:54] meat
[58:55] amen and jesus want to show them their
[58:57] insufficiency
[59:00] their insufficiency to be able to feed
[59:03] themselves
[59:05] and he said children this is his
[59:07] resurrection ministry
[59:08] children have you any meat no and he
[59:11] says cast on the other side
[59:13] amen and they cost so much amen they
[59:15] could not even hardly they could even
[59:17] bring it into the ship
[59:21] jesus knows where the fish are in the
[59:23] deep
[59:24] he knows where the meat is
[59:28] and he says now
[59:33] children have you any meat they answered
[59:34] him no and he said unto them cast you
[59:37] the net on the right side of the ship
[59:38] and you shall find
[59:39] and they cast therefore and now they
[59:41] were not able to draw it for the
[59:43] multitude of fish
[59:44] well yeah because you always got to go
[59:46] to the right side
[59:48] you can't be on the wrong side
[59:53] without jesus you're fishing on the
[59:54] wrong side
[59:57] in his resurrection he'll bring you to
[59:59] the right side
[1:00:05] therefore that disciple verse 7
[1:00:08] therefore that disciple whom jesus loved
[1:00:12] saith unto peter it is the lord
[1:00:16] that disciple whom jesus loved was john
[1:00:19] and john was a type of the bride
[1:00:22] and now there's seven in this boat
[1:00:27] representing the seven churches there's
[1:00:28] seven in this boat
[1:00:30] amen and jesus comes when they've toiled
[1:00:33] all night
[1:00:33] amen they've been in night they've been
[1:00:35] in darkness
[1:00:38] they haven't been able to catch anything
[1:00:40] and jesus comes and he says
[1:00:42] cast on the right side and they when
[1:00:44] when he does
[1:00:45] something like he did before because he
[1:00:48] did this for these fishermen before
[1:00:51] they had labored all night and toiled
[1:00:52] and caught nothing and jesus says
[1:00:54] cast back out and they said we've
[1:00:56] labored all night not caught anything
[1:00:57] it's
[1:00:58] worthless he said cast off
[1:01:01] he said now let down thy net and they
[1:01:03] had so much the net was breaking they
[1:01:05] had to call
[1:01:05] other fishermen in to help them
[1:01:08] so now when john when he recognizes
[1:01:12] he's doing something like he did before
[1:01:17] when he recognizes this this i recognize
[1:01:20] this this is familiar to me
[1:01:22] i've seen this before i've heard this
[1:01:24] before
[1:01:26] and it was the bride amen it was the
[1:01:28] bride it was john
[1:01:30] who said it's the lord amen it's not
[1:01:32] just a man who knows where the fish is
[1:01:34] it's not just a man who took a guess
[1:01:36] it was a man who knew exactly where the
[1:01:38] fish was it was the man who created the
[1:01:40] fish
[1:01:41] it was the man who placed the fish
[1:01:45] and john says it's the lord
[1:01:53] now when simon peter heard this it was
[1:01:55] the lord he girded his fisher's coat
[1:01:57] unto him for he was naked and then cast
[1:01:58] himself into the sea
[1:02:00] and the other disciples came in a little
[1:02:02] ship for they were not far from land
[1:02:04] but as it were 200 cubits dragging the
[1:02:06] net with fishes
[1:02:07] as soon then as they were come to the
[1:02:09] land they saw a fire of coals there
[1:02:11] in fish layer and bread
[1:02:16] jesus was going to feed them himself
[1:02:20] he supernaturally had fish that they
[1:02:23] didn't catch
[1:02:26] because see jesus can always break the
[1:02:30] bread
[1:02:31] he can always bring the broiled fish
[1:02:33] amen
[1:02:34] he can always he wants to feed his
[1:02:36] children
[1:02:37] amen and it was fish that they didn't
[1:02:39] catch
[1:02:44] in a fire called there and fish laid
[1:02:46] there on and bread and jesus said to
[1:02:47] them bring
[1:02:48] of the fish which ye have now caught
[1:02:50] simon peter went and drew the net to
[1:02:51] land
[1:02:52] full of great fishes 150 and three and
[1:02:55] for all there were so many yet was not
[1:02:56] the
[1:02:57] net broken jesus said unto them come and
[1:03:00] dine
[1:03:01] and none of the disciples just asked him
[1:03:03] who art thou
[1:03:04] knowing that it was the lord listen this
[1:03:07] is a
[1:03:08] strange way to write this verse
[1:03:11] it's very strange none of them are
[1:03:13] asking if he
[1:03:15] looked exactly the same why would the
[1:03:17] scripture be written this way
[1:03:20] he must have come in another form
[1:03:24] and nobody durst asked him who are they
[1:03:27] because they knew it was the lord
[1:03:29] well if he looked exactly the same
[1:03:31] that's self-explanatory you wouldn't
[1:03:32] write the verse that way
[1:03:34] there's a mystery hidden between the
[1:03:36] lines he appeared yet in another form
[1:03:39] amen but he was identified by telling
[1:03:42] them where to catch the fish
[1:03:43] doing something he had done before and
[1:03:46] the bride recognized
[1:03:47] that's the lord she recognized amen i've
[1:03:50] seen this before
[1:03:51] i went through this before this is
[1:03:53] familiar to me he's done
[1:03:55] that's the messiah he's the only one
[1:03:57] that can do that
[1:04:06] and they don't even ask him who he is
[1:04:09] because they know by revelation
[1:04:13] not by facial structure
[1:04:16] they know by his works and his word
[1:04:21] that it's him
[1:04:25] how was he identified in the third pool
[1:04:29] how was he identified in the
[1:04:30] resurrection ministry
[1:04:33] this is how
[1:04:43] again then said that he did them come
[1:04:44] and dine and none of the disciples
[1:04:46] there's ask him who art thou knowing
[1:04:47] that it was the lord
[1:04:49] jesus then cometh and take his bread and
[1:04:51] giveth them and
[1:04:52] and fish likewise this is now the third
[1:04:55] time that jesus showed himself to his
[1:04:56] disciples
[1:04:57] after that he was risen from the dead so
[1:05:00] when they had dined jesus saith to simon
[1:05:03] peter simon son of jonas loveth thou me
[1:05:06] more than these we know the whole uh
[1:05:09] conversation here he asked him but he's
[1:05:12] telling him feed my lambs
[1:05:14] feed my sheep feeding my sheep
[1:05:17] and he gets down to verse 18 he says
[1:05:19] verily verily i say unto thee
[1:05:20] when thou was young thou girdest thyself
[1:05:23] and walketh wither thou wouldas
[1:05:24] but when thou shalt be old thou shall
[1:05:26] stretch forth thy hand
[1:05:28] and another shall gird thee and carry
[1:05:29] thee whither thou wouldest not
[1:05:31] then spakey signifying by what death he
[1:05:34] should glorify god and when he had
[1:05:36] spoken this
[1:05:37] he said unto him follow me
[1:05:40] so when jesus comes in his resurrection
[1:05:43] ministry
[1:05:44] he comes to take peter and positionally
[1:05:47] place him and put peter
[1:05:48] in a position of service and he's now
[1:05:52] asking
[1:05:52] peter to feed my lambs to feed my sheep
[1:05:55] and he begins to he begins to give him
[1:05:57] his calling his election
[1:05:59] his positional placing he's now bringing
[1:06:02] peter into adoption
[1:06:06] in verse 20 then peter turned about and
[1:06:09] saith
[1:06:10] seeth the disciple whom jesus loved
[1:06:12] following which also leaned on his
[1:06:14] breast this is the type of john
[1:06:15] this is john type of the bride to also
[1:06:18] lean on his breasts as supper and said
[1:06:19] lord
[1:06:20] which is he that betrayed which is he
[1:06:22] that betrayeth thee that's the question
[1:06:23] john asked the lord
[1:06:25] peter seeing him sayeth to jesus lord
[1:06:27] and what shall this man do
[1:06:29] jesus saith in him if i will that he
[1:06:32] tarry till i come what is that to thee
[1:06:34] follow thou me so in the resurrection
[1:06:38] ministry
[1:06:39] jesus comes to deal with the individual
[1:06:44] one man one person it has nothing to do
[1:06:47] with your neighbor has nothing to do
[1:06:48] with the next person in the aisle over
[1:06:50] the next seat over
[1:06:51] amen he's coming to bring you to
[1:06:53] adoption to bring you to a placing
[1:06:55] to call you to a work in the kingdom and
[1:06:57] he doesn't he's not going to tell you
[1:06:59] about nobody
[1:07:00] else because in this third pool ministry
[1:07:02] the third pull ministry is to
[1:07:03] one individual it's the one he's to give
[1:07:08] you your calling he's the position he
[1:07:09] placed you
[1:07:10] and the body and he's to call you unto
[1:07:13] your work amen
[1:07:14] not everybody else not a group this
[1:07:16] isn't the group it's the individual
[1:07:20] that's why christ is the mystery god
[1:07:21] revealed is the individual to the
[1:07:23] individual one person
[1:07:26] and now in the resurrection ministry
[1:07:28] it's to the
[1:07:29] one person for their calling in their
[1:07:31] positional place
[1:07:33] peter says well what about this one
[1:07:35] what's that to you
[1:07:37] follow thou me
[1:07:44] let's turn to ephesians 5.
[1:07:49] there's a couple other things i want to
[1:07:51] look at here and i want to take my time
[1:07:55] ephesians chapter 5
[1:07:59] verse 25.
[1:08:11] before we read that i just want to
[1:08:12] review because i'm going to
[1:08:14] i'm going to go down another little path
[1:08:16] for just a moment
[1:08:19] in the resurrection ministry
[1:08:22] there were no more campaigns
[1:08:28] it's not that there weren't any more
[1:08:29] miracles and there wasn't that there
[1:08:30] wasn't the power anymore
[1:08:32] it was all there were no more campaigns
[1:08:36] this wasn't first and second form
[1:08:40] it was not a public show in jesus
[1:08:43] resurrected ministry
[1:08:44] he was just coming to his elect
[1:08:49] and the purpose of coming to elect was
[1:08:51] to open to the scriptures and to open
[1:08:53] their understanding of the scriptures to
[1:08:54] call their name
[1:08:57] so that they would know who he is in the
[1:08:59] day and hour that they live
[1:09:00] so that he could positionally place them
[1:09:03] in the body as an individual in adoption
[1:09:07] so that he could send them out now as
[1:09:09] the light bearers
[1:09:10] in the mystery revealed do you see the
[1:09:14] resurrection ministry
[1:09:15] is it going on today absolutely
[1:09:20] in the resurrection ministry you
[1:09:24] can't go to him
[1:09:30] in the first and second pool when they
[1:09:32] found out that jesus was in a city
[1:09:34] all the all the little cities and tribes
[1:09:37] all around they would gather all their
[1:09:38] sick and they would come to him
[1:09:42] but in the third pool you can't come to
[1:09:45] him
[1:09:47] he has to come to you
[1:09:54] it's to the elect
[1:09:59] and in the first and second pool you
[1:10:01] could gather your sick you could go for
[1:10:03] a miracle you'd go for a healing
[1:10:04] you could you could see discernment you
[1:10:06] could do all of these things
[1:10:07] but in the third pool you can't go to
[1:10:09] him because
[1:10:11] he's not in a church he's not in a city
[1:10:15] he appears and vanishes comes behind
[1:10:18] closed doors where they're locked in
[1:10:20] hiding
[1:10:20] amen reveals something to them and
[1:10:22] vanishes out of their sight
[1:10:24] he steps out of the bushes brother
[1:10:26] benham says on the road to emmaus
[1:10:28] and begins to walk with just those two
[1:10:33] tell me how could the disciples go to
[1:10:36] him
[1:10:37] in the resurrection ministry where do
[1:10:39] you find him
[1:10:40] where does he dwell
[1:10:51] in the third pool ministry once he
[1:10:53] commissioned
[1:10:55] the disciples to carry the word now
[1:10:57] there's an ethiopian eunuch
[1:11:00] that ethiopian eunuch he goes up to
[1:11:02] jerusalem because that's
[1:11:04] where he used to find him
[1:11:07] but now he's in his resurrection and
[1:11:09] he's not there anymore and he can't find
[1:11:12] the lord he can't get the answers to his
[1:11:14] biblical questions
[1:11:18] and so now god is going jesus christ is
[1:11:22] going to appear to the eunuch in another
[1:11:24] form
[1:11:26] and it's going to be the form of philip
[1:11:29] and he's going to speak to philip by an
[1:11:31] angel he's going to say go
[1:11:33] down by the wilderness there and go
[1:11:35] where i tell you and he leaves samaria
[1:11:37] and he goes down here and he's waiting
[1:11:39] and now this ethiopian eunuch is coming
[1:11:41] down because the ethiopian eunuch tried
[1:11:43] to go to god but in the third pool you
[1:11:45] don't go to him he comes to you
[1:11:51] i want to ask you those of you who god
[1:11:53] had called from denominations and out in
[1:11:55] the world and called to this message
[1:11:56] did you come to the message or the
[1:11:58] message come to you amen
[1:11:59] did you hunt for him or did he hunt for
[1:12:01] his lost sheep
[1:12:06] and the resurrection ministry he comes
[1:12:09] for his elect
[1:12:14] now the ethiopian eunuch writing down
[1:12:16] reading isaiah
[1:12:17] not understanding the scriptures
[1:12:19] couldn't find god up in all those
[1:12:21] theologians
[1:12:23] and formal religion
[1:12:26] but god is going to come to him in
[1:12:29] another form
[1:12:32] it's going to be in the form of philip
[1:12:33] because philip is part of the body
[1:12:35] philip is part of the body
[1:12:39] the flesh and bone
[1:12:42] of the lord that's the scriptures
[1:12:47] that's just the bible
[1:12:50] and now it is once again by the baptism
[1:12:53] of the holy ghost
[1:12:54] amen it is now jesus christ in flesh
[1:12:57] again
[1:12:58] the flesh of his church
[1:13:02] and now he's coming in philip
[1:13:06] and he tells him draw to that chariot
[1:13:10] draws up alongside that chair and he
[1:13:12] hears him reading and he says understand
[1:13:14] us thou what thou readest
[1:13:15] he says how can i let some man show me
[1:13:23] and philip beginning at that scripture
[1:13:26] that scripture unlocked to him the
[1:13:29] mystery of christ
[1:13:32] beginning of that scripture that wasn't
[1:13:34] the only scripture he began at that
[1:13:35] scripture
[1:13:36] beginning at that scripture he unlocked
[1:13:38] unto him the mystery of christ
[1:13:42] and when they got done he says
[1:13:46] what does hinder me to be baptized
[1:13:47] here's water
[1:13:49] he says thou believe with all thy heart
[1:13:51] he says i believe
[1:13:52] and he takes him down and he baptizes
[1:13:53] him and after he baptized him guess what
[1:13:55] happens to philip
[1:13:56] he doesn't start a church he doesn't
[1:13:58] invite him to his church he doesn't pro
[1:14:00] he vanishes he's gone because he served
[1:14:02] his purpose because jesus christ and the
[1:14:04] resurrection ministry
[1:14:05] came to that eunuch in another form
[1:14:08] because jesus christ was getting ready
[1:14:10] to go down to ethiopia in another form
[1:14:12] and now he was going to go down in the
[1:14:14] form of this ethiopian eunuch because
[1:14:16] brother bam said he took the message
[1:14:17] down to ethiopia
[1:14:24] praise god
[1:14:28] in the resurrection ministry
[1:14:32] they have the day of pentecost and then
[1:14:35] day of pentecost the holy ghost falls
[1:14:37] upon them
[1:14:40] they begin speaking with other tongues
[1:14:41] they spill out onto the street there are
[1:14:43] so many there gathered at the
[1:14:45] feast of pentecost that all heard them
[1:14:46] speaking in their own language
[1:14:49] and it caught the attention now i just
[1:14:52] want you to catch what i'm saying
[1:14:54] it caught the attention of the crowd
[1:14:59] but speaking with tongues and them
[1:15:00] hearing in their own language
[1:15:02] did not bring a conversion it just got
[1:15:04] their attention
[1:15:09] because they began to question it and
[1:15:11] condemn it and they said these men are
[1:15:13] drunk being but the third hour of the
[1:15:14] day
[1:15:18] and peter stood up in their midst
[1:15:21] being filled with the holy ghost he
[1:15:24] stood and said
[1:15:25] these men are not drunk as you suppose
[1:15:28] but this is the scriptures
[1:15:32] these modern events i'm going to make
[1:15:34] clear to you
[1:15:35] by the scriptures this is what the
[1:15:38] prophet
[1:15:38] joel said this is what david said and he
[1:15:41] preached to them a sermon
[1:15:43] out of the scriptures and when he
[1:15:46] opened to them the scriptures is that
[1:15:49] what happened
[1:15:50] is that what peter was doing after he
[1:15:53] opened to them the scriptures
[1:15:55] at the opening of the word in verse 37
[1:15:58] and acts 2 it says
[1:16:00] then their hearts were pricked
[1:16:06] and they said men and brethren what must
[1:16:07] we do and he said repent
[1:16:09] and be baptized in the name of lord
[1:16:11] jesus christ for the mission of sins and
[1:16:12] you shall receive
[1:16:14] the gift of the holy ghost
[1:16:21] see the hearing the tongues
[1:16:25] and their own ears didn't prick their
[1:16:28] heart
[1:16:33] the sign and the wonder attracted their
[1:16:36] attention but it didn't change their
[1:16:38] heart
[1:16:40] and they misunderstood the sign and were
[1:16:43] condemning it as something evil
[1:16:46] it wasn't bringing conversion it was
[1:16:48] bringing their attention
[1:16:51] to now where christ was because christ
[1:16:53] is now
[1:16:54] in his bride and peter stands up and
[1:16:57] begins to
[1:16:58] open to them the scriptures concerning
[1:17:01] what
[1:17:02] concerning their day the prophecy of
[1:17:06] joel
[1:17:06] the prophecy of david in their day
[1:17:10] and when they saw the opening of the
[1:17:13] word
[1:17:14] their hearts were pricked and then
[1:17:17] they were converted
[1:17:21] i hope you see this cycle i hope you
[1:17:24] understand
[1:17:25] what the third pull is
[1:17:35] now let's go to ephesians
[1:17:40] let's go to ephesians 25
[1:17:47] husbands love your wives even as christ
[1:17:49] also loved the church
[1:17:51] and gave himself for it
[1:17:55] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:17:58] with the washing of the water
[1:17:59] by the word now i want you to catch this
[1:18:01] phrase
[1:18:04] christ also loved the church and gave
[1:18:05] himself for it so he died for it
[1:18:08] he gave himself for it that he might so
[1:18:12] now we're going to see the purpose of
[1:18:13] his death
[1:18:16] all right do you understand that in the
[1:18:17] scriptures
[1:18:19] he loved it and gave himself for it that
[1:18:21] he might so now we're going to look at
[1:18:22] the reason he gave himself for the
[1:18:24] church
[1:18:24] or the purpose of his death
[1:18:28] he gave himself for it that he might
[1:18:30] sanctify and cleanse it
[1:18:32] with the washing of water by the word
[1:18:35] that he might present to himself a
[1:18:37] glorious church
[1:18:38] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:18:40] thing that
[1:18:41] it might be holy and without blemish
[1:18:44] so what men to love their wives as their
[1:18:46] own bodies he that loveth his wife
[1:18:48] loveth himself
[1:18:49] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[1:18:51] but nourisheth and cherishes that
[1:18:53] even as the lord the church for we are
[1:18:56] members of his body
[1:18:58] of his flesh and of his bones
[1:19:07] for this cause shall a man leave his
[1:19:10] father and a mother and shall be joined
[1:19:11] unto his wife
[1:19:12] and they too shall be one flesh this is
[1:19:14] a great mystery
[1:19:15] but i speak concerning christ in this
[1:19:18] church
[1:19:20] he was typing the natural marriage but
[1:19:22] he was actually speaking of christ in
[1:19:24] his church
[1:19:24] and now he was telling us the reason
[1:19:27] that jesus gave himself for the church
[1:19:29] he gave it so that he might sanctify it
[1:19:32] and cleanse it with the washing of water
[1:19:33] of the word
[1:19:34] why he wanted to present that bride to
[1:19:37] himself
[1:19:38] without spot without blemish without
[1:19:40] wrinkle without any such thing
[1:19:41] so that that they too could be one so
[1:19:44] that he could unite with her
[1:19:45] so that she would be his body his flesh
[1:19:49] his bone
[1:19:52] that's the reason he died
[1:19:56] now let's go to christ as the mystery
[1:19:57] god revealed and see what the prophet
[1:19:59] says here
[1:20:00] he says you think i'm beside myself i'm
[1:20:03] not
[1:20:03] we've got the devil's answer not me that
[1:20:05] liveth but christ the word living in me
[1:20:08] it's not my idea it's his power not my
[1:20:11] idea it's his word
[1:20:12] he promised it here it is he said it
[1:20:14] would be here and here it is
[1:20:16] we gotta answer answer christ has risen
[1:20:18] and has paid the price for a redemption
[1:20:21] what god in christ manifested he gave
[1:20:23] that flesh
[1:20:24] that and blood that it that the blood
[1:20:26] might come
[1:20:27] the life and the flesh be redeemed that
[1:20:30] god in his redeemed flesh
[1:20:32] could manifest his word for the day as
[1:20:34] he did in that day
[1:20:36] he said woo glory you see it
[1:20:40] oh my when can i stop notice it
[1:20:43] then you stand justified in the presence
[1:20:46] of god as a drop of ink dropped into the
[1:20:48] tub full of bleach
[1:20:49] you'll never find the stain of ink no
[1:20:51] more it went somewhere it'll never come
[1:20:53] back again
[1:20:54] and when man is truly redeemed that
[1:20:56] predestinated seed that sees it
[1:20:59] and accepts it his sins are demolished
[1:21:04] he didn't mention any work you have to
[1:21:06] do he said that predestinated seed that
[1:21:09] sees it and accepts it
[1:21:10] his sins are demolished
[1:21:15] it's gone it's separated it's dropped in
[1:21:17] the ink of the blood of jesus christ and
[1:21:18] it's never to be remembered
[1:21:20] god forgets it and he stands as a son
[1:21:22] and daughter of god in the presence of
[1:21:24] god
[1:21:25] now you are the sons of god not we will
[1:21:28] be we
[1:21:28] are now we are redeemed we have satan's
[1:21:31] answer
[1:21:32] god has vindicated himself god here amen
[1:21:35] christ the risen lord
[1:21:36] is here in the same power of his
[1:21:39] resurrection that he ever was
[1:21:41] manifesting himself there's the devil's
[1:21:44] answer
[1:21:45] that's the reason when this man sitting
[1:21:47] here dropped dead the other day sitting
[1:21:49] here
[1:21:49] we could say come back life because the
[1:21:51] holy spirit said so
[1:21:52] that's why i could do that that little
[1:21:54] baby yonder in mexico had been dead for
[1:21:56] about 15 hours when the vision came and
[1:21:58] said
[1:21:59] call it back to life and said let the
[1:22:02] baby live
[1:22:03] and the baby that doctors wrote a
[1:22:04] statement died at nine o'clock that
[1:22:06] morning and 11 o'clock that night came
[1:22:08] back to life
[1:22:08] it's living today what is it not them
[1:22:11] people
[1:22:12] the headship and the body has become one
[1:22:15] unit
[1:22:16] it's god manifested in his people
[1:22:21] he's come in another form
[1:22:25] that's the reason the husband and wife
[1:22:27] is no longer twain they're one
[1:22:29] god in his church is one christ in you
[1:22:31] god's great
[1:22:32] revelation glory to god even bearing his
[1:22:35] name his name is jesus the anointed the
[1:22:37] reason he's called jesus he is the
[1:22:39] anointed
[1:22:40] it's the anointed body of christ proving
[1:22:43] manifesting god
[1:22:44] like that body did and that body
[1:22:46] redeemed every of these bodies
[1:22:48] and through there god works his
[1:22:50] threefold manifest manifestation
[1:22:52] going to the kingdom risen paid the
[1:22:54] price we're redeemed
[1:22:56] god has proved it vindicated it and we
[1:22:59] stand justified in christ before him
[1:23:01] because
[1:23:01] he cannot pass judgment for he's already
[1:23:04] judged that body
[1:23:05] in which i am a part of how am i a part
[1:23:09] of it
[1:23:09] here it is it's in me if you abide in me
[1:23:13] and my words and you then
[1:23:14] and ask the father anything in my name
[1:23:16] it'll be done because
[1:23:17] it's their justified glory to god oh if
[1:23:19] i could get the world to see that
[1:23:21] why there you are there is the body of
[1:23:23] christ living standing redeemed redeemed
[1:23:26] oh my
[1:23:27] justified in his sight why are we
[1:23:29] justified
[1:23:30] we are his victory now he says why are
[1:23:34] we justified
[1:23:35] because he had to justify us because he
[1:23:37] wants to unite with us so that we can be
[1:23:39] his body
[1:23:40] his flesh his bones
[1:23:43] he said justified we are his victory the
[1:23:46] church is his victory we come forth in
[1:23:48] this last day with his glorious gospel
[1:23:50] showing his victory
[1:23:51] he died for this purpose and we are
[1:23:54] proof of his victory amen
[1:23:55] when we see him coming down and living
[1:23:57] among the church that's his victory
[1:24:00] shows that he couldn't keep him in the
[1:24:02] grave neither can they keep us that's
[1:24:04] right
[1:24:05] and we're already potentially arise
[1:24:07] because we've raised from the dead
[1:24:09] unbelief in his word from denominational
[1:24:11] creeds to an eternal word
[1:24:13] of the eternal god which is him himself
[1:24:16] working through us manifesting himself
[1:24:18] that he is the same yesterday
[1:24:20] today and forever
[1:24:23] and then the world comes on the the
[1:24:25] world word moves on down into the body
[1:24:28] from the head what is it
[1:24:29] the same word nothing can be added or
[1:24:31] taken from it so that the same word
[1:24:33] moves from the head as the day comes
[1:24:34] close
[1:24:35] down into the body down into the body
[1:24:37] vindicating that they are one
[1:24:39] they are husband and wife their flesh of
[1:24:42] his flesh
[1:24:42] word of his word life of his life spirit
[1:24:45] of the spirit
[1:24:46] amen how do you know it bears the same
[1:24:49] record
[1:24:50] same fruit same word see manifest
[1:24:53] christ same life same god same spirit
[1:24:55] same word
[1:24:56] same book amen same science things that
[1:24:58] i do shall you do also
[1:25:00] oh hallelujah notice the vindicated word
[1:25:03] in his body
[1:25:04] is his very victory and the reason of
[1:25:07] his death
[1:25:09] so why did he die so that he could
[1:25:12] sanctify you
[1:25:13] by the washing of the water of the word
[1:25:15] so he can wash you from all the filth of
[1:25:17] these prostitutes
[1:25:19] so that he could present to himself
[1:25:22] what does it mean to present himself to
[1:25:25] come into a marriage union
[1:25:27] to present to himself a bride without
[1:25:29] sparta wrinkle why
[1:25:30] she's been washed from these prostitute
[1:25:33] spirits she's been washed from this
[1:25:35] religious
[1:25:36] this religious false vine that come from
[1:25:38] all the way back in the beginning
[1:25:39] this word the washing of the water of
[1:25:41] the word is washing her and separating
[1:25:43] her back from cain's religion
[1:25:47] so that she can be without spot or
[1:25:49] wrinkle so that he can unite with her
[1:25:51] so that the two can be one flash so that
[1:25:54] we can be his body
[1:25:55] his flesh his bones
[1:25:58] that's a tight uniting friends
[1:26:03] so the the vindicated word in his body
[1:26:06] is his victory the word the headship
[1:26:10] moving down into the body is his victory
[1:26:14] and the reason of his death see the
[1:26:18] death not in the spirit
[1:26:19] when he died he only died in the flesh
[1:26:20] his spirit went to hell and preached the
[1:26:22] souls in prison that's right
[1:26:23] his flesh only died when he raised it up
[1:26:25] again and quickened it quickened means
[1:26:27] made alive
[1:26:27] his flesh which was his body and that's
[1:26:30] the word
[1:26:31] it's been laying dead for years but it
[1:26:33] gradually began to come in the
[1:26:35] reformation
[1:26:36] and now she's standing upon her feet
[1:26:40] what is it it's the resurrection
[1:26:43] this is the resurrection season and the
[1:26:46] bride will have a resurrection ministry
[1:26:50] what will the resurrection ministry look
[1:26:51] like like the resurrection ministry
[1:26:56] i want to look at two more scriptures
[1:26:57] and read a few more quotes but let's go
[1:26:58] to colossians
[1:27:00] keep your place in ephesians we'll come
[1:27:01] back to ephesians let's look in
[1:27:03] colossians
[1:27:06] chapter 1 verse 26
[1:27:12] colossians 1 26 even the mystery which
[1:27:14] has been hid from ages and from
[1:27:16] generations that now has made manifest
[1:27:17] to the saints
[1:27:19] and whom god would make known what is
[1:27:20] the riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:27:22] among the gentiles
[1:27:23] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[1:27:27] this was the purpose of his death and
[1:27:30] this is his victory
[1:27:33] ephesians 1 and 19
[1:27:44] and what is the exceeding greatness of
[1:27:46] his power to us word who believe
[1:27:48] according to the working of his mighty
[1:27:50] power
[1:27:51] which he rotten christ when he raised
[1:27:52] him from the dead and set him at his own
[1:27:54] right hand in the heavenly places
[1:27:56] far above all principalities and power
[1:27:58] and might and dominion
[1:28:00] and every name that is named not only in
[1:28:02] this world but also
[1:28:03] in that which is to come and have put
[1:28:05] all things under his feet and gave him
[1:28:07] to be the head over
[1:28:08] all things to the church which is his
[1:28:10] body
[1:28:12] so the church is his body the fullness
[1:28:15] of him
[1:28:16] that filleth all in all the church
[1:28:20] is to be his body is to be the fullness
[1:28:23] or
[1:28:23] filled with him that filleth all in all
[1:28:25] this is the scripture where brother
[1:28:27] branham
[1:28:28] gets all that god was he poured into
[1:28:30] christ
[1:28:31] this scripture is speaking this and all
[1:28:33] that christ was
[1:28:34] he pulled into his body that they might
[1:28:37] be the head over the body
[1:28:38] the fullness of him that filleth all in
[1:28:41] all
[1:28:42] all that god was he poured into christ
[1:28:44] all that christ was he poured into his
[1:28:45] church
[1:28:46] this is the reason of his death this is
[1:28:49] his victory
[1:28:51] now i want to read a couple quotes
[1:28:54] he said look here now we find remember
[1:28:57] we are flesh of his flesh and bone of
[1:28:59] his bones
[1:29:00] as god raised his bones and flesh out of
[1:29:01] the grave they cannot hide the man that
[1:29:03] has
[1:29:04] the potentials death cannot take him
[1:29:06] jesus said all
[1:29:07] the father has given me will come to me
[1:29:09] i'll raise him up at the last day oh my
[1:29:11] easter
[1:29:12] why we're right in easter when he raised
[1:29:15] we raised with him
[1:29:16] he sent the abstract back we hold it as
[1:29:18] the baptism of the holy ghost he is
[1:29:19] alive forevermore
[1:29:20] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:29:22] hebrews 13 8 proves that
[1:29:24] he's the same his messianic anointed
[1:29:27] ones believes that
[1:29:29] what is the messiah what is the messiah
[1:29:31] messiah
[1:29:32] is anointed one and now if he was the
[1:29:34] messiah by being the anointed one for
[1:29:36] that day to fulfill the word of god
[1:29:38] to be the redeemer and the anointed one
[1:29:40] and god raised up that body
[1:29:42] his bride is the anointed one for this
[1:29:45] day
[1:29:46] because his bride is the anointed one
[1:29:48] for this day it's already raised up with
[1:29:50] him in the resurrection because these
[1:29:52] two
[1:29:52] are one
[1:29:58] the anointed one for this day is jesus
[1:30:01] christ in the formation of his bride
[1:30:03] she's anointed with this spirit she's
[1:30:05] bearing his life
[1:30:06] he's been given his word
[1:30:10] and he came in the resurrection ministry
[1:30:12] and in the resurrection third paul
[1:30:13] ministry
[1:30:14] he came to open the scriptures to to
[1:30:17] open their understanding of the
[1:30:18] scriptures to call their name
[1:30:20] to place them in adoption as an
[1:30:23] individual and i'd like to say that that
[1:30:26] ministry continues on
[1:30:28] in the bride today what
[1:30:31] what ministry or should we she i say
[1:30:34] what ministry should we be looking for
[1:30:36] we should be looking for a third pool
[1:30:37] ministry
[1:30:40] this is the opening of the word
[1:30:43] brother branham he says in 1963
[1:30:48] and the greater than solomon is here
[1:30:50] said those that
[1:30:51] the section by section alright he's
[1:30:53] calling them prayer line that those that
[1:30:55] are in the back there
[1:30:56] that's holding the prayer card step
[1:30:57] right out in front of the line there
[1:30:59] right section now i want you to know my
[1:31:02] brother and sisters that you don't have
[1:31:03] to wait for some special advantages to
[1:31:05] come by no no
[1:31:06] your pastor is the same now he may he
[1:31:08] may not be able to have the prophetic
[1:31:10] gift
[1:31:11] that comes in once once in a generation
[1:31:13] but look
[1:31:14] he has the same rights to pray for you
[1:31:16] that i would
[1:31:17] that discernment doesn't heal you it
[1:31:19] only brings you
[1:31:20] god conscious that you are in the
[1:31:22] presence of god
[1:31:25] there's a reason that i want to say that
[1:31:27] i i've received several comments
[1:31:29] recently
[1:31:30] and it's been going on now for about two
[1:31:32] years but
[1:31:33] but i get it almost every service
[1:31:37] that somebody will come to me and be
[1:31:39] like brother chad
[1:31:40] everything you said was word for word a
[1:31:42] conversation we had yesterday
[1:31:45] does that happen to any of you said i
[1:31:47] asked my wife a question i asked this
[1:31:49] brother question i asked
[1:31:50] i asked my husband a question and the
[1:31:52] next service or two services you came
[1:31:53] and you answered exactly what the
[1:31:55] question was i
[1:31:58] i had one brother the other day come to
[1:32:00] me and he said he said
[1:32:02] uh brother chad he said did you talk to
[1:32:04] brother so-and-so
[1:32:06] it was after the sermon i said no he
[1:32:08] said you didn't talk to him
[1:32:09] i said no he said you should talk to him
[1:32:11] i said i'm not going to talk to him
[1:32:14] i've already got my trainer at the hot
[1:32:15] i'm not going to talk to him
[1:32:18] two weeks later i speak to that other
[1:32:20] brother and that
[1:32:21] other brother said oh you talked to
[1:32:22] brother son so i said no i never talked
[1:32:24] to that brother
[1:32:25] he said you didn't talk to that brother
[1:32:28] i said no
[1:32:29] he said i was sure that next service
[1:32:31] should talk to that brother
[1:32:33] i said i never said a word to him he
[1:32:35] said i just knew you talked to him
[1:32:38] and then the brother began to weep he
[1:32:40] said because it was
[1:32:41] exactly not close
[1:32:44] but exactly word for word
[1:32:50] there's a reason i'm going through all
[1:32:52] this so relax
[1:32:55] relax it's happening more
[1:32:58] and more and more more frequently
[1:33:02] with more intensity
[1:33:06] i see people sometimes in the service
[1:33:08] i'll say something they'll smile and
[1:33:09] look over like this
[1:33:10] trying to get somebody's attention
[1:33:11] across the room
[1:33:16] and i have no idea what i said to cause
[1:33:18] that reaction but i know
[1:33:19] they're they're doing like looking over
[1:33:26] i heard stories of people who will oh as
[1:33:28] quick as they can they want to get out
[1:33:29] in the fore and said did you talk to him
[1:33:30] then did you talk to him
[1:33:38] i just want to i want to say this for a
[1:33:40] reason
[1:33:41] the discernment doesn't heal you it only
[1:33:44] brings you god conscience that you're in
[1:33:45] the presence of god
[1:33:50] because it's the person of the word
[1:33:52] because the word is a discerner of the
[1:33:54] thoughts
[1:33:55] and intents of the heart
[1:33:59] see brother branham had a prophetic gift
[1:34:01] and he had a gift of discernment
[1:34:04] amen but i have no gift of discernment
[1:34:07] now god is taking the word and by the
[1:34:11] word
[1:34:11] he is bringing discernment into our
[1:34:14] lives
[1:34:14] accurate spot on shocking discernment
[1:34:18] into our lives
[1:34:19] but he's not doing it through a gift of
[1:34:21] discernment because i don't have the
[1:34:23] gift of discernment
[1:34:24] and it proves that it has nothing to do
[1:34:26] with the man standing in the pulpit
[1:34:27] because that man doesn't have that gift
[1:34:30] if i had that gift it would be an
[1:34:32] operation of the gift but it's not an
[1:34:33] operation of the gift
[1:34:35] so it has to be an operation of the word
[1:34:37] which is evidence that the bridegroom is
[1:34:39] here
[1:34:40] telling you what you talked about in
[1:34:41] your bed chamber
[1:34:43] [Applause]
[1:34:45] people have asked me they said you want
[1:34:47] i got a text from a sister one time said
[1:34:49] no fair you're listening to my prayers
[1:34:54] i'm not listening to anything i have no
[1:34:56] idea i have no idea when it happens
[1:34:58] except when people are craning their
[1:35:00] neck to see if somebody else heard it
[1:35:04] one brother told me the other day he
[1:35:05] said i i he because i almost got to the
[1:35:06] point where i stood i'm saying like
[1:35:08] do you hear that
[1:35:14] but if if i had a gift of discernment
[1:35:19] then it would be the operation of a gift
[1:35:22] but that is not the operation of a gift
[1:35:24] of discernment the only gift i have is a
[1:35:26] gift of a pastor the gift of a preacher
[1:35:30] it's the bridegroom himself is here he's
[1:35:33] the one who's listening he's the one who
[1:35:35] knows
[1:35:35] he's answering the questions he's
[1:35:37] discerning the situation
[1:35:38] he's giving the answers why because
[1:35:42] he's the word and when the word is in
[1:35:43] place the word is a discerner of the
[1:35:45] thoughts and intents of the heart the
[1:35:46] word is a healer the word is a deliverer
[1:35:48] the word is a provider
[1:35:50] you don't need the man with the gift you
[1:35:52] just
[1:35:53] need to be a yielded vessel because the
[1:35:55] the bridegroom is here
[1:35:57] amen the clouds show that the headship
[1:35:59] was coming to unite with the bride
[1:36:01] the bridegroom is here and if the
[1:36:03] bridegroom is here
[1:36:04] there's nothing that he can't answer
[1:36:06] through that word
[1:36:08] this is the resurrected ministry of
[1:36:10] jesus christ where he
[1:36:11] takes the word and he he brings
[1:36:13] discernment by the word
[1:36:19] somebody will say to me but it said you
[1:36:21] said you said everything we said the
[1:36:23] other day
[1:36:24] and and they'll say when you said this
[1:36:26] this and this and i'm like i don't even
[1:36:27] remember saying this this and this
[1:36:30] like i don't even remember preaching
[1:36:32] that
[1:36:36] so what is that the intelligence of man
[1:36:39] no
[1:36:40] it's the presence of the bridegroom the
[1:36:43] bridegroom is here
[1:36:44] he's the strong man in the house he's
[1:36:46] the one who's making sure that this
[1:36:48] bride won't fail
[1:36:50] he's the one discerning situations he's
[1:36:53] the one answering questions
[1:36:54] he's the one bringing correction
[1:36:57] to wrong thinking and the wrong
[1:36:59] understanding it's the presence of the
[1:37:01] bridegroom
[1:37:01] why because he promised that he would
[1:37:03] have a bride without spot or wrinkle
[1:37:05] and you and i can't do it friends amen
[1:37:08] and just the gifted man he can't do it
[1:37:10] either
[1:37:10] it's got to be the bridegroom himself to
[1:37:13] make sure that he's going to present
[1:37:15] himself
[1:37:15] a bride without spot or wrinkle
[1:37:19] and how is he going to do it by the
[1:37:20] washing of the water of the word
[1:37:27] amen it becomes shocking it happens to
[1:37:30] me when i sit in my seat me and my wife
[1:37:31] will be elbowing each other
[1:37:33] like and she'll look at me and smile and
[1:37:36] i'll be smiling through my mask or her
[1:37:39] because it was something we just said
[1:37:41] something we just talked about
[1:37:42] a question that we had it's not one
[1:37:44] preacher it's all of them because the
[1:37:48] bridegroom is here
[1:37:50] because our your bridegroom your mate
[1:37:54] is the revealed word for the hour and
[1:37:57] when you've accepted the leadership of
[1:37:58] the bridegroom
[1:38:01] listen understand me when you've
[1:38:03] accepted the leadership by submission
[1:38:05] submitting to the leadership of the
[1:38:06] bridegroom it's the leadership of the
[1:38:08] word for your day
[1:38:10] and under the leadership of your
[1:38:11] bridegroom now the bridegroom comes down
[1:38:14] and is the strong man of the house
[1:38:18] and the strong man of the house will say
[1:38:21] be careful there watch out for that this
[1:38:23] is good go there don't go there
[1:38:27] oh the other day you were wondering
[1:38:28] about this
[1:38:31] oh when you were wondering why brother
[1:38:33] brenham said that this is the reason why
[1:38:38] praise god we can all rejoice and shout
[1:38:43] because we know my husband is here the
[1:38:45] bridegroom is here
[1:38:46] and he hears me in my conversation he
[1:38:49] hears me when i pray
[1:38:50] and he's answering back according to his
[1:38:53] method
[1:38:54] to answer back us through the preaching
[1:38:55] of the word and he's promised that he
[1:38:57] would do it he's doing it
[1:38:58] because there's no way it's that man
[1:39:01] there
[1:39:03] i've had funny encounters it's comical
[1:39:05] to me
[1:39:07] i've had funny encounters with people
[1:39:09] who have really never met me and never
[1:39:10] known me but they've only understood
[1:39:12] they've only listened to sermons and you
[1:39:15] meet them
[1:39:16] and you can tell when you begin to talk
[1:39:19] you know i'm not i'm not super social
[1:39:21] and i'm not
[1:39:22] the most observant person in the world
[1:39:24] i'm sorry i'm not sentimental really
[1:39:26] not overly affectionate i mean i love
[1:39:28] people but you can tell
[1:39:31] that after a conversation they're a
[1:39:33] little bit disappointed
[1:39:39] because there's just a man
[1:39:43] and then there's god working through a
[1:39:44] gift
[1:39:47] and people expect you to be the same
[1:39:50] person out of the pool that you are
[1:39:51] inappropriate and it's not even the same
[1:39:55] because if you just yield yourself then
[1:39:57] it's not you anymore you're just
[1:39:58] standing by when he said that
[1:40:02] and i feel bad sometimes because
[1:40:04] sometimes i disappoint new people
[1:40:12] because it's it's not a powerful
[1:40:14] preacher
[1:40:15] it's not a powerful sermon it's not a
[1:40:18] great teacher gift of discernment isn't
[1:40:20] that it's the bridegroom
[1:40:22] himself all he needs is somebody who
[1:40:24] will surrender to the headship
[1:40:26] all he needs is a people who will say we
[1:40:28] want that headship
[1:40:29] we want you to be our headship we don't
[1:40:31] want our own way we want to lay our life
[1:40:33] down and submit to this word a hundred
[1:40:35] percent
[1:40:39] he doesn't want a woman who'll go our
[1:40:41] way and take her own thing
[1:40:43] and work her own job and solve her own
[1:40:45] problems and buy her own this
[1:40:47] he doesn't want that kind of woman he
[1:40:48] wants a woman who will be surrendered to
[1:40:50] him
[1:40:50] so that he can be the strongman of the
[1:40:52] house so he can be the discerner of the
[1:40:54] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:40:55] amen but when you take the word down
[1:40:57] you're going to have to find a strong
[1:40:59] man somewhere
[1:41:03] we don't want a strong man we want
[1:41:04] christ the king amen we want our husband
[1:41:07] here
[1:41:07] we want him to do it through the
[1:41:08] weakness of man not the strength of man
[1:41:12] because we don't want to exalt men we
[1:41:13] don't want anybody to get out of
[1:41:14] position
[1:41:15] we want christ to be in position we want
[1:41:17] it to be him
[1:41:18] he's our lover he's our mate he's our
[1:41:20] guide he's our protector
[1:41:24] he's the one who makes sure that the
[1:41:26] that the kirby sweeper salesman is not
[1:41:28] taking advantage of you
[1:41:33] you guys are under 30 don't even know
[1:41:34] what i'm talking about
[1:41:43] because he comes in like a slicker tries
[1:41:45] to sell the product
[1:41:46] going door to door and begins to
[1:41:50] begins to flatter wife oh you've got a
[1:41:54] beautiful home you're a good housekeeper
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:41:58] your husband must be so lucky i've got a
[1:42:00] vacuum cleaner
[1:42:01] that'll change your life
[1:42:07] but you know if the husband's home when
[1:42:09] he comes to the door
[1:42:10] that sweeper system starts talking
[1:42:12] differently
[1:42:17] we don't want to be an independent woman
[1:42:19] we don't want to stick up for ourselves
[1:42:20] defend ourselves figure anything out for
[1:42:22] ourselves
[1:42:22] we don't want to be smart we don't want
[1:42:24] to be strong we don't want to be
[1:42:25] anything
[1:42:26] we just want to be his amen we want him
[1:42:28] to be on the scene
[1:42:29] he's the strongman of the house he's
[1:42:31] keeping the the salesman
[1:42:34] run out of the house selling this
[1:42:37] religious idea and that religious idea
[1:42:39] and this compromise
[1:42:40] we want the bridegroom here to say no we
[1:42:42] don't need it amen no we don't want it
[1:42:44] thank you but that's okay we're fine
[1:42:49] hallelujah it's not her it's him
[1:42:56] i want to read a couple things here
[1:42:58] along this line
[1:43:01] brother ben said in 1955 shows the
[1:43:04] father now i believe
[1:43:06] he's here with his people and just as a
[1:43:08] divine gift it does not heal anyone
[1:43:10] it only raises their faith to a place so
[1:43:12] you can accept your healing
[1:43:14] the same thing has preached the word but
[1:43:16] it's jesus will come here now
[1:43:18] and do the same thing that he did when
[1:43:20] he was here on earth
[1:43:22] will it encourage you so that you can go
[1:43:24] home and know that he's raised from the
[1:43:26] dead
[1:43:28] i ask you the same thing if he comes
[1:43:30] down here and does something just like
[1:43:31] he did before
[1:43:34] if he comes down here just like he did
[1:43:37] as
[1:43:37] a son of man a the son of man working
[1:43:40] through a son of man
[1:43:41] bringing discernment and telling you
[1:43:43] exactly what conversation you had
[1:43:46] on your way to church if he can come
[1:43:49] down himself
[1:43:51] and do what you've seen him do before
[1:43:53] will you know that he's alive from the
[1:43:54] dead
[1:43:55] that this is the resurrection ministry
[1:43:57] that this is the third full ministry
[1:44:00] and it's not a man it's god
[1:44:07] things that are to be says now if we are
[1:44:10] those attributes of god we cannot live
[1:44:11] by creeds we cannot live by
[1:44:12] denominationalism we must live by the
[1:44:14] word
[1:44:15] because the bride is a part of the
[1:44:17] bridegroom like any wife is a part of
[1:44:19] her husband therefore we must be that
[1:44:21] word bride
[1:44:22] and what is the word bride the
[1:44:24] manifestation of this hour
[1:44:26] the bride not a creator denomination but
[1:44:28] a living oracle of god
[1:44:30] a living attribute of god displaying to
[1:44:32] the world the attributes of god
[1:44:34] and the formation of the bride that's to
[1:44:36] be expressed in this hour
[1:44:37] that we're now living and that is his
[1:44:40] victory
[1:44:40] and the reason of his death
[1:44:47] and christ is the mystery of god
[1:44:48] revealed he says
[1:44:50] and there there would be a time come
[1:44:52] forth when he would express himself in
[1:44:53] fullness of his godhead deity through
[1:44:55] his
[1:44:55] church because now she's the body the
[1:44:59] fullness of him
[1:45:01] that filleth all in all we just read
[1:45:03] that in ephesians
[1:45:05] express himself in the fullness of his
[1:45:07] god had deity through his church
[1:45:08] having the preeminence in his church oh
[1:45:11] my what
[1:45:12] the anointed man now the anointed people
[1:45:15] oh my to bring back the anointed bride
[1:45:17] and bridegroom anointed by what
[1:45:19] accepting what eve turned down and adam
[1:45:21] what did they turn down they turned down
[1:45:23] the word
[1:45:25] accepting what eve turned down in adam
[1:45:28] coming back with the anointing of the
[1:45:30] word because he said
[1:45:31] my word is spirit see anointed with the
[1:45:34] word what eve turned down
[1:45:35] he comes back and we accept
[1:45:39] in 1963 he says
[1:45:43] in the message we have seen a star and
[1:45:45] have come to worship him
[1:45:46] would you deny what jesus said himself
[1:45:50] what the bible itself speaks out which
[1:45:53] is christ the anointed word and if the
[1:45:55] word abides in you then you're anointed
[1:45:57] you and your anointed person with the
[1:45:59] word
[1:46:01] you abide in me and my word in you then
[1:46:02] ask what you will to be done for you
[1:46:04] that's christ in you anointing the word
[1:46:06] for this age
[1:46:07] whatever age they lived in
[1:46:12] now i want to look at luke chapter four
[1:46:17] i'm going to take a few more minutes and
[1:46:19] take a look here in luke
[1:46:21] i had a conversation wednesday night
[1:46:22] with a brother out in the foyer
[1:46:24] and he said something that just i could
[1:46:26] not get off my mind
[1:46:27] could not stop so i had to go look at it
[1:46:30] when i looked at it
[1:46:31] i had to preach it
[1:46:35] in luke chapter 4 verse 16 this is when
[1:46:38] jesus comes into nazareth and he comes
[1:46:40] into a synagogue and sits down
[1:46:42] and they take the scroll and they hand
[1:46:43] it to him and brother branham is going
[1:46:45] to pick this
[1:46:46] up and uh this day this scripture is
[1:46:48] fulfilled and preach it there
[1:46:49] because he's going to have the same
[1:46:50] thing happen to him when he preaches
[1:46:52] birth pains
[1:46:54] and verse 16 says and he came to
[1:46:55] nazareth where he had been
[1:46:57] brought up and as his custom was he went
[1:46:59] into the synagogue
[1:47:00] on the sabbath day and stood up for to
[1:47:02] read and there was delivered unto him
[1:47:05] the book of the prophet isaiah's
[1:47:07] and when he had opened the book he found
[1:47:08] the place where it was written
[1:47:10] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:47:12] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:47:14] the gospel to the poor
[1:47:16] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:47:18] to preach deliverance to the captive
[1:47:20] recovery of sight to the blind to set at
[1:47:23] liberty them that are bruised
[1:47:25] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:47:27] lord
[1:47:32] and he closed the book and he gave it
[1:47:34] again to the minister he sat down and
[1:47:36] the eyes of all them that were in the
[1:47:37] synagogue were fastened on him and he
[1:47:39] began to say unto them
[1:47:40] this day is this scripture fulfilled in
[1:47:42] your ears
[1:47:44] and all bear him witness and wandered at
[1:47:46] the gracious words which proceeded out
[1:47:48] of his mouth
[1:47:49] and they said is not this joseph's son
[1:47:52] and he said unto them you will surely
[1:47:54] say
[1:47:55] to me this prophet physician healed
[1:47:57] myself he begins to prophesy
[1:48:00] but now he takes the scriptures he's in
[1:48:03] nazareth his hometown
[1:48:05] in nazareth he goes into the synagogue
[1:48:08] he takes the scriptures
[1:48:10] and he begins to identify himself
[1:48:13] by the word
[1:48:16] and he says the spirit of the lord is
[1:48:18] upon me because he has anointed me to
[1:48:20] preach the gospel to the poor
[1:48:23] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:48:25] to preach liberty
[1:48:26] to the captives in recovery of sight to
[1:48:28] the blind to set at liberty them that
[1:48:30] are bruised and the priest the
[1:48:32] acceptable year of the lord
[1:48:34] brother brahm's going to pick this up
[1:48:35] and he's going to make a few comments
[1:48:37] that i think are
[1:48:37] astounding in 1955 he says where
[1:48:42] i think pentecost failed this was the
[1:48:44] name of the message where i think
[1:48:45] pentecost failed
[1:48:46] so jesus had the greatest anointing of
[1:48:49] any man that was ever on earth
[1:48:51] is that the truth believe that
[1:48:54] is that right one day he went into the
[1:48:56] temple they gave him the scroll
[1:48:58] he picked it up in his hand he sat down
[1:49:01] and he read over in isaiah where it said
[1:49:04] the spirit of the lord is upon me to
[1:49:05] preach the acceptable year and so forth
[1:49:07] the jubilee year
[1:49:08] and he took the scroll and handed it
[1:49:10] back and sat down and precious words
[1:49:12] proceeded from his mouth
[1:49:13] the greatest anointing that was ever in
[1:49:15] the world on the lord jesus christ
[1:49:18] oh sometimes we get we methodists get
[1:49:21] noise confused with anointing
[1:49:23] noise ain't anointing no no i've seen
[1:49:25] where there's a lot of noise and not
[1:49:27] faith enough to curse it to cure a
[1:49:28] turtle toothache
[1:49:30] you've got to come solely to the father
[1:49:32] you've got to know exactly where you're
[1:49:34] standing
[1:49:37] in 1956 the message why are people so
[1:49:40] tossed about
[1:49:41] he says some people gets the wrong
[1:49:43] impression of what the anointing is
[1:49:45] did you ever think of that when was the
[1:49:47] greatest anointing ever give to anyone
[1:49:49] and what did they do when they had that
[1:49:51] anointing
[1:49:52] the greatest anointing was ever give to
[1:49:54] anyone was jesus christ
[1:49:56] we have the spirit by measure he had it
[1:49:58] without measurement and one day he
[1:50:00] entered into the temple and picked up
[1:50:01] the scroll
[1:50:02] and read said the spirit of god is upon
[1:50:04] me for he has anointed me to preach the
[1:50:06] acceptable year
[1:50:07] to bind up the broken hearts to heal the
[1:50:08] sick give sight to the blind
[1:50:10] and now we would think if such anointing
[1:50:12] was on him that had been prophesied 800
[1:50:15] years before that it would come
[1:50:17] and here he was with that type of
[1:50:18] anointing the full blessings and
[1:50:20] anointing of the lord upon him
[1:50:22] he would want to run all over the
[1:50:23] building scream and holler
[1:50:25] but the bible said he laid down the
[1:50:27] scroll set down
[1:50:28] and precious words proceeded from his
[1:50:30] mouth that's what he'd done
[1:50:32] under the anointing
[1:50:36] the anointing is not emotions the
[1:50:39] anointing is supreme power in control
[1:50:42] like knowing exactly what and how see
[1:50:45] and that's
[1:50:46] what's here
[1:50:51] jesus under the greatest anointing that
[1:50:54] was ever in a person
[1:50:58] and what did he do with that anointing
[1:50:59] he even began to read the scripture that
[1:51:01] spoke of his anointing
[1:51:03] god has anointed me to preach the gospel
[1:51:06] to the poor
[1:51:08] the open blind eyes that set the
[1:51:10] captives free
[1:51:11] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:51:13] lord
[1:51:14] that anointing upon him was so that
[1:51:18] he could bring the word
[1:51:22] so that he could open the scriptures
[1:51:25] and that he could say this day
[1:51:28] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:51:33] see there's nothing wrong with noise
[1:51:35] there's nothing wrong with getting
[1:51:36] excited
[1:51:37] but we can't confuse that for the
[1:51:38] anointing that's what brother bam said
[1:51:41] there's nothing wrong with being
[1:51:42] enthused and being excited and shouting
[1:51:44] and i like services like that where
[1:51:46] there's a robust amen and a hallelujah
[1:51:49] and praise the lord
[1:51:50] raising our hands and stomping a fee i
[1:51:52] like it like that
[1:51:54] but we can't confuse that for anointing
[1:51:56] and the louder faster and harder we
[1:51:59] preach does not mean it's more anointed
[1:52:03] this is just the truth
[1:52:06] there's a style of preaching called
[1:52:08] anointed preaching but that's not what
[1:52:10] brother branham described as anointed
[1:52:12] preaching
[1:52:13] and i don't care if it's fast or slow
[1:52:16] i don't care if i can barely keep up or
[1:52:18] if it's so slow i'm like next sentence
[1:52:20] please
[1:52:24] the anointing will bring the word for
[1:52:26] your day
[1:52:29] the resurrection ministry the third pool
[1:52:31] is the opening of the word for your day
[1:52:34] it's opening the scriptures and opening
[1:52:36] your understanding to understand the
[1:52:37] scriptures
[1:52:38] the the third paul ministry to the elect
[1:52:40] will be calling your name
[1:52:42] will be positioning you in adoption amen
[1:52:45] we'll be doing all of those things in
[1:52:46] the resurrection ministry
[1:52:48] because this is the resurrection of the
[1:52:50] bride this is the word that's been
[1:52:52] laying dead now
[1:52:53] for generations but slowly now begin to
[1:52:55] come up through luther through wesley
[1:52:56] through pentecost and now
[1:52:58] she's standing on her feet what is the
[1:53:00] resurrection of the bride
[1:53:04] and she has to be anointed but with what
[1:53:06] kind of anointing
[1:53:07] we can't misunderstand the anointing
[1:53:09] amen you can preach according to your
[1:53:11] personality
[1:53:12] slow or fast i'm fine with either
[1:53:16] in fact i like the word kind of fast
[1:53:18] myself
[1:53:22] but that anointing will bring the word
[1:53:25] for your
[1:53:26] day that anointing will be
[1:53:29] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[1:53:32] your ears
[1:53:34] not a historical jesus not what happened
[1:53:36] long ago
[1:53:38] not being pointed in the wrong
[1:53:39] directions not a run back
[1:53:41] to the previous church ages but that
[1:53:43] anointing take the scroll
[1:53:45] take the word open it to the part that
[1:53:48] apply today
[1:53:49] read the scriptures and say this day the
[1:53:51] scriptures will fill in your ears
[1:53:53] that's what the greatest anointing that
[1:53:54] was ever upon a human being did
[1:53:56] what did that anointing do the anointing
[1:53:58] had him hand him a scroll
[1:54:00] they gave him a scroll in in his
[1:54:02] hometown of nazareth where he's not
[1:54:03] respected
[1:54:06] gave him the scroll he read it he gave
[1:54:09] the scroll back
[1:54:10] and he sat down
[1:54:14] ask you a question how dynamic is the
[1:54:17] preaching
[1:54:17] sitting down
[1:54:22] he sat down and gracious words begin to
[1:54:25] come out of his mouth
[1:54:30] the doctrine of the day the word for
[1:54:34] that hour
[1:54:35] the revelation amen that'll bring an
[1:54:37] awakening
[1:54:39] to a bride that'll open our eyes
[1:54:42] doing something that he did before
[1:54:45] when through the preaching of the word
[1:54:47] not a gift of discernment but the
[1:54:49] preaching of the word
[1:54:50] he'll begin to speak back to you what
[1:54:52] you spoke to him in a prayer
[1:54:55] and to begin to answer back to you a
[1:54:57] question you were asking him in a prayer
[1:55:01] what's he doing he's trying to break the
[1:55:03] bread for you
[1:55:06] so you can say it's my lord
[1:55:09] he's here it's jesus christ
[1:55:13] it's not a man it's not a person it's
[1:55:15] not a preaching gift it's
[1:55:16] jesus christ here
[1:55:20] to break the word for his bride to do
[1:55:23] something like he did before
[1:55:26] look at brother branham he come to the
[1:55:28] most the
[1:55:29] the highlight of his ministry
[1:55:33] was when he preached the seals is that
[1:55:36] he talked about it all the time he said
[1:55:38] if i ever preached anything that was
[1:55:40] spiritually anointed
[1:55:41] amen it was those seals
[1:55:44] the seals was the highlight of his life
[1:55:47] and i tell you
[1:55:48] where's the discernment
[1:55:52] where is the big meeting what was it the
[1:55:54] highlight of his ministry
[1:55:56] was when he was opening the word
[1:56:00] he was most anointed this was the
[1:56:02] calling that he was called to all his
[1:56:04] life
[1:56:04] was to come down and open the seals and
[1:56:06] then to reveal the mystery of god as the
[1:56:08] seventh angel revelation 10 7
[1:56:10] it was the purpose of his coming it was
[1:56:12] the highlight of his ministry it was the
[1:56:14] reason that he was on the earth and many
[1:56:16] when he come to it
[1:56:17] amen he he he only had one prayer
[1:56:20] meeting and that prayer meeting was
[1:56:21] after questions and answers on saturday
[1:56:23] morning and it was a fast line
[1:56:25] where they run through and all the
[1:56:25] preachers touch them and said be he'll
[1:56:27] be healed receive it in jesus name
[1:56:30] not a dynamic show of a gift
[1:56:35] i hope you understand what i'm saying
[1:56:38] when he come to his anointing when he
[1:56:41] came to the
[1:56:42] purpose which he was anointed for as the
[1:56:44] seventh angel
[1:56:47] when he came to it what was it
[1:56:50] verse by verse scripture by scripture
[1:56:54] opening of the seals
[1:56:57] revealing the seals through the bible
[1:57:04] what was it it was the awakening of the
[1:57:06] bride
[1:57:08] it was the calling of the bride it was
[1:57:10] the third poem ministry the sword in his
[1:57:12] hand the opening of the word
[1:57:15] and he said it'll be so humble
[1:57:19] will the bride have a ministry in the
[1:57:21] end time yes sure it's going on right
[1:57:23] now
[1:57:24] it's consisted of apostle prophet pastor
[1:57:26] teachers and evangelists
[1:57:27] amen going on all the time he said it'll
[1:57:29] be so humble
[1:57:34] why because in the resurrection ministry
[1:57:39] he opened the scriptures
[1:57:43] and he opened the understanding of the
[1:57:44] scriptures
[1:57:46] and he called her name and he
[1:57:48] positionally placed peter
[1:57:50] and he did it to the individual
[1:57:54] in that ministry they weren't coming to
[1:57:56] him
[1:57:57] they didn't know where to find him mary
[1:57:59] said to the
[1:58:00] what she thought was the gardener show
[1:58:02] me where he is and i'll go get him
[1:58:05] and he said mary
[1:58:10] i'm right here
[1:58:13] he's coming to you
[1:58:17] he's coming to you how's he coming he's
[1:58:20] in another form
[1:58:21] preaching a sermon for six hours
[1:58:26] on revealed prophecy what was that
[1:58:29] that was him he was there when he was
[1:58:33] invited
[1:58:34] into the house amen and they still
[1:58:35] didn't know who he was but he did
[1:58:37] something like he had done before so
[1:58:39] that they would know
[1:58:40] it has to be him
[1:58:44] we broke the bread their eyes were
[1:58:46] opened brother said
[1:58:47] they began to get excited and he was
[1:58:48] gone
[1:58:51] because the point was to get them
[1:58:52] connected to the word
[1:58:55] so that they would become the word for
[1:58:56] their day so that
[1:58:58] now they would carry the word and be the
[1:59:00] light bearers
[1:59:03] that's the reason of his death and that
[1:59:06] is his victory
[1:59:08] this bride is now the anointed of the
[1:59:11] lord
[1:59:12] is that true what should she do
[1:59:15] under this great anointing
[1:59:19] what kind of ministry should she have
[1:59:21] under this great anointing
[1:59:23] now it's the anointed bride anointed by
[1:59:26] his life
[1:59:27] what kind of ministry should she have
[1:59:30] listen
[1:59:30] i don't care about volume matters
[1:59:32] nothing to me
[1:59:35] loud quiet i've been allowed means i was
[1:59:37] thrilled with i was so excited i loved
[1:59:39] it
[1:59:40] why because the word was opening to me
[1:59:45] i heard a brother preach that was almost
[1:59:48] monotone
[1:59:50] almost monotone and like he was reading
[1:59:53] bullet points off of his notes
[1:59:57] and i was just as thrilled because it
[1:59:59] was opening the word
[2:00:04] what is that anointing for the bride to
[2:00:05] do she
[2:00:07] is the one carrying the word she has the
[2:00:09] life
[2:00:10] amen she knows the word she can open the
[2:00:12] word
[2:00:13] because the word's been opened to her
[2:00:15] she's ate the open book
[2:00:18] she's become one with it and now she and
[2:00:21] she can open the word and now
[2:00:22] god can give you of his spirit your
[2:00:24] heart can be pricked
[2:00:26] you can be baptized in his name you can
[2:00:27] repent be baptized in his name
[2:00:29] and you shall receive the gift of the
[2:00:30] holy ghost he'll come in your heart and
[2:00:32] break the bread personally to you
[2:00:36] and open your understanding to
[2:00:38] understand the scriptures
[2:00:41] will the bride have a ministry at the
[2:00:42] end time sure
[2:00:44] a great ministry it's going on now
[2:00:49] it consists of pastors of apostles
[2:00:51] evangelist teachers
[2:00:54] it'll be so humble
[2:00:57] what will it be it'll be the word
[2:01:02] and when the word comes discernment
[2:01:05] comes
[2:01:06] when the word comes healing comes
[2:01:11] the scripture says he sent his word and
[2:01:14] healed their disease
[2:01:17] when the bridegroom is in position and
[2:01:20] the bridegroom is esteemed and held in
[2:01:22] that position and the bride room begins
[2:01:24] to speak

[2:01:40] and the word will do it through an
[2:01:41] apostle novenza's a pastor a teacher

[2:01:47] the one that comes through the tape or
[2:01:49] the book that you're reading

[2:01:52] that is our mate that is our husband
[2:01:54] that is who we become one with is the
[2:01:56] word and the ministry of the bride and
[2:01:58] the ministry of christ will be the same
[2:02:00] ministry
[2:02:03] and it'll be the ministry of the word
[2:02:06] and as that word goes out there's still
[2:02:09] supernatural power
[2:02:11] under the opening of the word
[2:02:17] supernatural power while you sit and
[2:02:20] hear the word
[2:02:21] and believe that that's your bridegroom

[2:02:26] your disease you accept it now
[2:02:28] sitting in your seat and say under that

[2:02:47] there's not enough lands laid on you
[2:02:48] that can heal you it's your faith
[2:02:50] in that word that speaks of that that
[2:02:52] heals you
[2:02:55] amen when the word goes forth everything
[2:02:58] you
[2:02:59] need is in that word that's why we feed

[2:03:43] by doing something like he did before
[2:03:46] children cast dinette on the right side

[2:03:54] gift through brother brown that was able
[2:03:55] to tell you
[2:03:56] what you were talking about at your
[2:03:58] house
[2:03:59] before you came to church
[2:04:02] did we see that before
[2:04:06] and now when he comes and does the same
[2:04:08] thing and tells you
[2:04:09] what you were talking about the night
[2:04:11] before or the you know your phone's not
[2:04:13] bugged there's no cameras in your house
[2:04:16] there's no listening devices in your car
[2:04:21] but i know some of you have wondered
[2:04:23] because you told me you have
[2:04:27] what is it it's the presence of the
[2:04:29] bridegroom doing
[2:04:30] something like he did it before so
[2:04:32] you'll know it's the messiah

[2:04:38] healed i can be delivered i can be set
[2:04:40] free

[2:04:42] can be filled with the spirit
[2:04:43] anything i have need of because the
[2:04:45] bridegroom's here and he's proving it
[2:04:49] service after service conversation after

[2:05:04] taking the word in the third pool
[2:05:09] and showing that he's here
[2:05:13] i get excited it's an excitement
[2:05:17] it's an excitement that goes so deep
[2:05:19] sometimes all i can do is sit and cry
[2:05:23] it's an enthusiasm that goes beyond
[2:05:25] emotions no emotions come with it
[2:05:27] but there's a reality that comes to
[2:05:28] recognize that we are totally incapable
[2:05:31] of doing anything in our own
[2:05:34] we are just as helpless as the poor
[2:05:36] fishermen fishing all night
[2:05:38] doing the best they can with all the
[2:05:39] skill they've collected over their lives
[2:05:41] and still have nothing
[2:05:42] that's what we are friends without him
[2:05:46] that's what we
[2:05:46] are but then he shows up
[2:05:50] and he says cast your net on the other
[2:05:51] side
[2:05:53] and all of a sudden click click click
[2:05:55] click click

[2:06:32] humble
[2:06:34] let it not let's not miss the grasp the
[2:06:36] reality of what's happening all around
[2:06:38] us
