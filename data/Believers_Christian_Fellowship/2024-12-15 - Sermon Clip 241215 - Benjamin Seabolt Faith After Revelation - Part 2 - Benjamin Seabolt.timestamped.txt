[0:01] Souls that are in prison now brother
[0:02] Bram says a man that's got the spirit of
[0:04] God in him or a woman lives the word
[0:06] that's the heartbeat the predestinated
[0:08] for the word of God comes to them and
[0:10] they are the word to the
[0:13] people what a
[0:18] statement that's the heartbeat that
[0:20] predestinated for the word of the Lord
[0:22] comes to them and they are the word to
[0:24] the people written Epistles read of all
[0:27] men is that right could the Third be on
[0:31] is the third poll to preach to the
[0:33] Eternal doomed that's rejected the
[0:35] message of
[0:39] Salvation And this is where he makes
[0:40] this statement the six seal has produced
[0:43] itself uh speaking of the judgments
[0:44] coming on the earth The Sixth Seal has
[0:47] produced itself the seventh seal brings
[0:50] him back to
[0:54] Earth I find it extremely interesting
[0:58] that he makes that statement immediately
[1:01] after he says that the word of God comes
[1:03] to this group of people and they are the
[1:06] word to the
[1:10] people what is the seventh
[1:14] seal the seventh seal is not a piece of
[1:17] paper wrote up with a stamp on
[1:23] it the seventh seal is when Christ comes
[1:28] back to Earth Earth that's why brother
[1:31] brandom said I can take one of these
[1:33] seals and I can go from Genesis to
[1:35] Revelation and I can preach it around
[1:37] and around and around the clock because
[1:40] the seventh seal is not a definition of
[1:43] the interpretation of these symbols the
[1:46] seventh seal is an event and the seventh
[1:49] seal was all the way back in Genesis it
[1:51] wasn't just in Revelation it's just not
[1:54] now it's now that we
[1:57] understand it's now that we can see that
[2:00] was all the way back but it was still
[2:01] going on back
[2:03] then because why because the seventh
[2:06] seal is when Christ comes back to
[2:10] Earth let me say it this way the seventh
[2:13] seal is when Christ shows up in your
[2:15] situation
[2:18] amise amen the seventh seal is not when
[2:22] you show up in your
[2:24] situation the seventh seal is Christ
[2:27] coming into your situation
[2:30] amen amen he says the six seal has
[2:33] produced itself obviously six comes
[2:36] right before seven what's the Sixth Seal
[2:39] judgment what brings the seventh seal
[2:43] judgment we've got to judge ourselves
[2:46] understand that we're not worthy
[2:48] understand that we don't stand a chance
[2:50] understand that we can't fix this
[2:52] problem amen mechanically approach the
[2:56] seventh seal the mechanics have to be in
[2:59] place
[3:00] the mechanics are judging
[3:03] ourselves coming to the appropriate
[3:05] conclusion that I have no human ability
[3:07] to fix this or to Manifest this or to
[3:10] make this word of God
[3:13] live and then and only then the seventh
[3:17] seal can come back to earth
