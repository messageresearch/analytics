[0:27] partakers of his grace

[0:50] [Applause]
[0:57] kings and priests to god
[1:01] we shall reign with him forever
[1:28] [Applause]
[1:37] we are family
[1:49] i lift it up
[2:04] my soul
[2:18] overflow
[2:25] fill it up
[2:31] oh
[2:55] my soul
[3:15] fill it
[3:17] [Music]
[3:18] me
[3:44] my is
[4:02] is
[4:14] let's just pray together
[4:17] precious lord jesus
[4:20] lord we're so thankful that
[4:22] you've provided
[4:24] something with inside of us lord that
[4:27] you could feel
[4:29] lord because we know if it wasn't for
[4:32] that that
[4:33] it would just be like water on a duck's
[4:35] back father and it would have no effect
[4:37] on us
[4:39] but by your love and your predestination
[4:41] you've
[4:42] gave us a receptor on the inside of the
[4:44] inside that we could hear your voice
[4:47] lord and it could have an effect on our
[4:49] life
[4:50] lord we would never want to
[4:52] underestimate the value of that lord
[4:55] never under appreciate what that really
[4:57] means
[4:58] for we know without that there would be
[5:00] no purpose
[5:01] lord we would just pray that you would
[5:03] come at this point in the service and
[5:06] just do what only you can do father
[5:09] lord we stand here as a mere mortal
[5:12] father
[5:13] totally incapable of doing what is
[5:15] required father
[5:17] but we know that you can so we just pray
[5:19] that you would come
[5:21] that you have your perfect will that you
[5:24] would speak what you want spoken father
[5:27] and that you would just hear through
[5:29] each and every one that's here that your
[5:31] divine purpose for this service will be
[5:33] accomplished we just commit ourselves to
[5:35] you in the name of the lord jesus christ
[5:38] amen
[5:40] god bless you this morning if you have
[5:41] your bible we'll go straight to the
[5:43] scripture we're going to turn to the
[5:45] book of revelation chapter 6.
[5:48] i'm going to go ahead and apologize for
[5:50] taking so much time for preaching this
[5:52] morning
[5:53] so that way here in about six hours i
[5:55] don't have to apologize again
[5:58] and now that i've scared you to death
[6:00] about six hours worth of preaching when
[6:01] i only go two or three it won't seem
[6:03] near as bad
[6:04] at least that's my thought process i
[6:06] don't i don't know if that will manifest
[6:09] or not but
[6:10] we definitely come with a full heart
[6:13] a lot of information a lot of material
[6:16] and
[6:17] we just want the lord to have his way
[6:20] more than anything if
[6:21] if he would just come and speak for 10
[6:23] minutes it would be
[6:25] more than me standing here reciting an
[6:28] intellectual speech for all day or just
[6:30] reading quotes and scriptures we have to
[6:33] have to have a supernatural element and
[6:36] that's what we desire for him to have
[6:37] his perfect will
[6:39] but i'd like to speak this morning on on
[6:41] the fifth seal and there's a couple
[6:43] topics that that we'll get into
[6:46] underneath of this fifth seal as we move
[6:48] forward but as our pastor was
[6:50] ministering two sundays ago on the sixth
[6:53] seal there at the crucifixion there was
[6:55] just so many things that clicked during
[6:58] that service it was really overwhelming
[6:59] to me and i've kind of been beside
[7:02] beside myself for the last two weeks
[7:03] because it just keeps unfolding so
[7:07] as kyle said you know wednesday we're
[7:09] starting to bite off more than we can
[7:11] chew on a regular routine basis now
[7:14] but i think that's scriptural because
[7:16] even john in the book of revelation it
[7:18] comes to
[7:19] a point he's seen all these things and
[7:21] finally he comes and there's this great
[7:23] group of people and the angel asked him
[7:26] you know who are these and john just
[7:27] says i don't know
[7:29] you tell me
[7:30] so i think that's kind of the point that
[7:31] we're coming to even as we go higher and
[7:33] higher and higher in revelation and it's
[7:36] so wonderful and we can see that portion
[7:38] so clearly but it opens up so other so
[7:40] many other avenues and other questions
[7:42] that it's just astounding
[7:44] but we just have to keep walking in the
[7:46] channel that he's in and he'll make
[7:49] known what is needed to be made known
[7:52] and we trust him to do that so in
[7:54] revelation chapter 6
[7:57] beginning in verse 9.
[7:59] [Music]
[8:00] it says and when he had opened the fifth
[8:01] seal i saw under the altar the souls of
[8:04] them that were slain for the word of god
[8:06] and for the testimony which they held
[8:09] and they cried with a loud voice saying
[8:11] how long o lord holy and true dost thou
[8:14] not judge and avenge our blood on them
[8:16] that dwell on the earth
[8:18] and white robes were given unto every
[8:20] one of them
[8:22] and it was said unto them that they
[8:24] should rest yet for a little season
[8:26] until their fellow servants also and
[8:28] their brethren that should be killed as
[8:30] they were should be fulfilled may god
[8:33] add his blessing to the reading of his
[8:35] word as you would have your seats
[8:39] and the thought that i want to start
[8:40] with that just really struck me a couple
[8:42] sundays ago
[8:45] when he was dealing with the sixth seal
[8:47] there at the crucifixion
[8:49] and he was really laboring on the sixth
[8:51] seal and what that meant at the time of
[8:52] the crucifixion
[8:54] but the thought that just
[8:56] clicked with me during that service was
[8:58] not only was the sixth seal being
[9:00] manifested at that time
[9:02] but for that particular situation
[9:05] speaking
[9:06] specifically of the crucifixion and the
[9:09] times surrounding
[9:11] right around the crucifixion literally
[9:14] every seal was made manifest at that
[9:16] time
[9:17] and we know that that's not an uncommon
[9:20] thing because as we go back and look at
[9:21] the scriptures we can track those seals
[9:24] through every situation through each
[9:26] person through each pattern through each
[9:28] time element but the one that i just
[9:30] really want to focus on this morning
[9:34] is
[9:34] surrounding the first crucifixion of
[9:37] jesus christ and let's go to matthew 26
[9:40] and we'll begin there
[9:49] and i think by doing this we're going to
[9:52] i think it will help us and enable us to
[9:55] realize
[9:56] how simple
[9:58] that these seals are made manifest and
[10:00] how simple they can be made manifest in
[10:02] our lives on a daily basis and that's
[10:05] what i want us to catch
[10:07] matthew 26 verse 1
[10:10] it says and it came to pass when jesus
[10:13] had finished all these sayings
[10:16] he said unto his disciples
[10:18] ye know that after two days and this is
[10:20] the feast of the passover and the son of
[10:22] man is betrayed to be crucified
[10:25] then assembled together the chief priest
[10:27] and the scribes and the elders of the
[10:29] people unto the palace of the high
[10:31] priest who was called
[10:33] cataphasis
[10:35] caiaphas i'm sorry and consulted that
[10:38] they might take jesus by sebtility and
[10:40] kill him
[10:42] so if we remember a couple years back
[10:45] when brother when our pastor
[10:47] preached on the series of the seals and
[10:49] he exposed that pattern that was laying
[10:52] in the seals of how brother branham
[10:53] would come and even before he would get
[10:55] into the scriptures and the information
[10:57] of the seals he would start dropping
[10:58] parables in there and he'd say now just
[11:00] the other day i was talking to so and so
[11:02] and he would actually loose the seal
[11:06] 30 seconds into preaching
[11:08] and it just goes over the top of the
[11:10] heads of people sitting there and it
[11:11] went over the top of our heads for years
[11:13] and years and years and years
[11:15] but thankfully now that we see that key
[11:18] we can recognize what was going on and
[11:20] we know that as he took that and he laid
[11:22] that over each seal
[11:24] how simple but yet how profound that key
[11:28] was because now you realize brother
[11:31] branham will spend
[11:32] an hour and a half
[11:34] breaking the seal
[11:36] in such
[11:38] simplicity
[11:40] that when he acts that when he gets to
[11:42] the information of the seal he'll spend
[11:45] 15-20 minutes on it and he's done with
[11:48] it
[11:49] so it's just astounding that he would
[11:51] waste all of this time beforehand
[11:54] take 15 minutes and break the seal and
[11:56] then close the service
[11:58] so we have to as we get into this topic
[12:00] this morning we have to really let that
[12:02] bear on our mind
[12:04] and if we will we'll recognize right
[12:06] here in verse 4 the white horse rider
[12:09] just wrote
[12:12] consulted they may take
[12:14] jesus by subtility
[12:17] and kill him
[12:19] there went the white horse rider
[12:21] deception going forth sneakiness going
[12:25] forth
[12:26] and you can see that the white horse
[12:28] rider never wanted to stay the white
[12:30] horse rider because immediately it said
[12:33] that their goal was to kill him
[12:37] who would have thought two of the four
[12:39] horse riders were right there in that
[12:40] verse
[12:41] but they're clear as they right there
[12:46] they consulted that they might take
[12:48] jesus by septility and kill him
[12:50] skipping to verse 14.
[12:53] then one of the twelve called judas
[12:55] iscariot went unto the chief priest
[12:59] and said unto them
[13:01] what will you give me and i will deliver
[13:02] him unto you and they coveted with him
[13:05] for 30 pieces of silver
[13:07] so now just in verse 14 and 15 we
[13:10] recognize that this third horse rider
[13:12] rides because he's dealing with the
[13:14] clergy
[13:16] and he's trying to sell them salvation
[13:20] in such
[13:21] simplicity
[13:23] these patterns lay right in there
[13:26] so now we've already had the first horse
[13:28] rider run
[13:29] it showed he was going to end up on the
[13:30] fourth one we've got the third seal
[13:32] going forth
[13:34] let's go to verse 47 in the same chapter
[13:36] matthew 26
[13:40] 26 47
[13:43] and while he yet spake lo judas one of
[13:46] the twelve came and with him a great
[13:49] multitude with swords and stabs
[13:53] what horse you reckon that's right
[13:57] from the chief priest and the elders of
[13:59] the people
[14:00] now he that betrayed him gave them a
[14:02] sign saying whomsoever i shall kiss the
[14:05] same as he hold him fast and forthwith
[14:08] he came to jesus and said hell master
[14:11] and kissed him
[14:14] notice when that white horse rider rode
[14:17] he didn't stop riding
[14:20] just because the goal was to get on the
[14:22] fourth horse and just because the third
[14:24] horse had rode that white horse kept
[14:27] riding
[14:29] so here he came
[14:30] to this to the
[14:32] scribes and the pharisees and they
[14:33] consulted with deception and subtility
[14:37] full-blown white horse
[14:39] but yet judas keeps writing to the point
[14:41] that he comes up into the very face of
[14:43] christ himself and kisses him
[14:46] so here's the white horse standing
[14:48] kissing jesus and the red horse is right
[14:50] behind him
[14:52] at the same time
[14:56] i'll just say it like our pastor says it
[14:57] we have to let carnal thinking just
[15:00] completely go away
[15:02] we have to get out of the chronological
[15:04] one two three okay now the third one's
[15:07] over the fourth one's got to be coming
[15:09] it's not like that at all it's nothing
[15:11] like we thought saints
[15:13] when that first horse starts writing
[15:15] it just keeps writing
[15:17] and it keeps writing you can have
[15:19] multiple situations in your personal
[15:21] life that you are in full-blown
[15:23] spiritual famine in and there'll be
[15:25] another
[15:26] situation going on that's coming to you
[15:28] on a white horse
[15:30] at the same time
[15:33] it happened right here in the scripture
[15:34] to christ himself
[15:36] coming at him at the same time same
[15:40] thing will happen in our lives
[15:44] hell master and kissed him and jesus
[15:47] said unto him friend wherefore art thou
[15:50] come
[15:51] then came they laid hands on jesus and
[15:54] took him
[15:55] let's skip down to verse 59
[15:59] now the chief priest and the elders and
[16:01] all the council
[16:03] sought false witness against jesus to
[16:06] put him to death
[16:09] what do false witnesses not have
[16:12] let me rephrase the question so you'll
[16:13] be sure to catch it what are false
[16:16] witnesses in famine of
[16:22] black horse rider
[16:23] riding for all he's worth
[16:26] one two three four
[16:28] just right down through there in such
[16:31] simplicity and it lays right here in one
[16:34] chapter of the bible in a few verses
[16:36] in one situation in one scenario
[16:39] sought false witnesses against jesus to
[16:41] put him to death but found none
[16:45] they were so false they was in famine of
[16:47] false
[16:49] wrap your mind around that
[16:51] but found none yea though many false
[16:54] witnesses came yet found they none
[16:56] at the last came two false witnesses and
[16:59] said this fellow said i am able to
[17:01] destroy the temple of god and to build
[17:02] it in three days and the high priest
[17:05] arose and said unto him answer us now
[17:07] nothing what is it
[17:09] which these witness against thee
[17:11] but jesus held his peace and the high
[17:14] priest answered and said unto him i
[17:16] adjure thee we touched on this a couple
[17:18] services back but this is just such an
[17:21] incredible passage of scripture to me
[17:23] and the high priest answered and said
[17:25] unto him i adjure thee by the living god
[17:29] that thou tell us whether thou be the
[17:31] christ the son of god
[17:33] so as we said last time here is the high
[17:36] priest of the day standing in front of
[17:38] the living god demanding he in the name
[17:41] of the living god that he tell him if
[17:43] he's the living god or not
[17:46] if this is not a pale horse riding in
[17:49] its full force you tell me what else is
[17:52] he's standing in the face of god himself
[17:57] literally
[17:58] and using his
[18:00] name to injunct him and to demand that
[18:03] he tell him who he is
[18:06] and if you don't think it's a pell horse
[18:08] look at what jesus does he says thou has
[18:11] said
[18:13] he answered him he gave him the desire
[18:16] that he was wanting
[18:18] he gave the the high priest asked him a
[18:20] yes or no question
[18:22] yes or no in the name of the living god
[18:25] tell me yes or no jesus says thou has
[18:27] said
[18:29] see saints once you get on that pale
[18:31] horse
[18:33] god himself can stand and look you in
[18:36] the face and tell you the truth and
[18:37] you'll never recognize it
[18:39] when you hit the pale horse you're done
[18:42] brother branham says death means eternal
[18:45] separation from christ god himself
[18:47] cannot get you
[18:50] amen
[18:51] he asked him a yes or no question in the
[18:55] name of the living god and jesus said
[18:58] yes thou has said
[19:00] and he couldn't comprehend it
[19:07] pale
[19:08] horse nothing follows but hell
[19:13] thank god a believer cannot get on that
[19:14] horse
[19:18] i cannot think of anything that would be
[19:20] worse than standing before the face of
[19:22] the living god asking him if he is the
[19:24] living god and he tells me yes i'm the
[19:26] living god and i would be so spiritually
[19:29] dead i would not be able to comprehend
[19:31] that
[19:34] there could be nothing worse than that
[19:36] saints because you're beyond hope and if
[19:38] you have hope if you don't even have
[19:39] hope what do you have
[19:41] nothing you're done you're finished
[19:43] there is nothing worse
[19:46] there is nothing left but hell
[19:49] praise god a believer cannot get there
[19:52] he'll cut the legs off of that black
[19:54] horse he'll chop its head off he'll do
[19:56] whatever he has to do to a believer when
[19:57] they're riding that black horse to keep
[19:59] them from getting on a pale horse
[20:02] amen
[20:06] jesus said unto him thou has said
[20:09] nevertheless i say unto you hereafter
[20:11] shall you see the son of man sitting on
[20:12] the right hand of power and coming in
[20:15] the clouds of heaven then the high
[20:16] priest rent his clothes
[20:18] saying he hath spoken blasphemy what
[20:21] father need have we of witness
[20:23] behold now ye have heard this blasphemy
[20:26] what thank thee
[20:28] they answered and said he is guilty of
[20:31] death
[20:33] why do you think they thought he was
[20:35] guilty of death
[20:36] because that's what the pale horse
[20:38] thinks
[20:40] the pel horse thinks he's guilty of
[20:42] death each and every time
[20:46] let's skip to matthew 27
[20:48] just the next chapter over
[20:53] verse 45.
[20:55] matthew 27 verse 45.
[21:03] now from the sixth hour there was
[21:04] darkness
[21:06] what seal do you think we're talking
[21:07] about here we've just spent our pastors
[21:09] spent multiple services on it i'm not
[21:11] going to lay heavy on this we see this
[21:14] very clearly we know what seal this is
[21:17] there was darkness over all the land
[21:19] until the ninth hour and about the ninth
[21:22] hour jesus cried with a loud voice
[21:23] saying
[21:25] ella ella lama sabbath i may not have
[21:28] said that right
[21:30] that is to say my god my god why hast
[21:33] thou forsaken me
[21:35] clearly the sick still demonstrated us
[21:37] here
[21:39] so now here's a very interesting thing
[21:41] we've had the first seal correct second
[21:44] seal
[21:45] third seal
[21:46] the fourth seal and we've had the sixth
[21:48] seal
[21:49] we've had five of the seven seals here
[21:51] in matthew
[21:53] but if you look
[21:54] you'll not find the fifth or the seventh
[21:56] seal in matthew
[22:00] let's go to john 19.
[22:12] john 19 verse 28
[22:16] after this
[22:18] jesus knowing
[22:20] all things were now accomplished
[22:24] what seal does that sound like to you
[22:28] you will not find that in matthew mark
[22:31] or luke
[22:32] jesus knowing that all things were
[22:34] accomplished that the scripture might be
[22:36] fulfilled saith i thirst now there was a
[22:39] set of vessel
[22:41] there was a vessel full of vinegar and
[22:43] they filled a sponge with vinegar and
[22:44] put it upon hyssop and put it to his
[22:46] mouth when jesus therefore had received
[22:48] the vinegar he said it is finished
[22:52] and he bowed his head and gave up the
[22:54] ghost
[22:55] it's astounding to me that matthew mark
[22:57] and luke does not record jesus saying it
[22:59] is finished
[23:00] matthew records him saying my father my
[23:03] father why has thou forsaken me
[23:06] luke records him saying that
[23:10] into your hands i commit my spirit
[23:14] matthew mark and luke did not catch the
[23:16] seventh seal
[23:19] and it wasn't even their fault because
[23:22] the pattern already be laid out that the
[23:25] bride would be the only one to catch
[23:26] that seventh seal
[23:28] you have to go to john to catch the
[23:31] seventh seal
[23:33] he said the same thing saints it wasn't
[23:36] like
[23:37] there was two different times going on
[23:40] and some of them heard one thing at this
[23:41] time and then at another time somebody
[23:43] heard this this was the same situation
[23:46] the same time
[23:48] but yet john's the only one that thinks
[23:50] it's important to record he says it's
[23:51] finished
[23:53] wonder why
[23:55] the scripture is so precisely perfect
[23:59] it's astounding
[24:02] it's
[24:02] astounding
[24:04] there's a couple other things we'll get
[24:06] to along those lines later on
[24:08] but john is the only one that recognizes
[24:12] that these scriptures have been
[24:13] completed my purpose is fulfilled
[24:16] it is finished seventh seal
[24:19] but you notice we're still missing the
[24:21] fifth seal
[24:24] do you think matthew mark luke or john
[24:25] has that one
[24:28] let's skip down to verse 31
[24:30] same chapter verse 31
[24:34] the jews therefore
[24:36] because it was the preparation that the
[24:38] bodies should not remain upon the cross
[24:40] on the sabbath day for that sabbath day
[24:42] was on on high day
[24:44] besott pilate that their legs might be
[24:46] broken and that they might take them
[24:48] away
[24:49] then came the soldiers and break the
[24:51] legs of the first and and the other
[24:53] which was crucified with him
[24:55] but when they came to jesus and saw that
[24:57] he was dead already they break not his
[25:00] legs
[25:02] but one of the soldiers
[25:05] with a spear
[25:07] pierced his side
[25:08] and forthwith came there out blood
[25:11] and water
[25:16] this is in the book of john
[25:17] who just loosed the seventh seal
[25:19] comes to verse 34
[25:23] and you will not find this in matthew
[25:25] mark or luke
[25:27] john is the only one that recounts that
[25:29] there was one of the soldiers that came
[25:32] took a spear and thrusted into the side
[25:34] of jesus christ
[25:38] he had a nail in this hand
[25:40] he had a nail in his hand
[25:42] he had a nail through each feet
[25:45] that's four
[25:48] but the fifth seal comes
[25:50] because the fifth seal is me and you
[25:53] and that roman soldier even though he
[25:56] was already dead
[25:58] has to
[26:00] has to
[26:01] has to
[26:04] take that spear and run it through the
[26:06] ribs of jesus
[26:08] right into his heart and loose that
[26:10] fifth seal
[26:12] that was his fifth wound saints
[26:15] he had to have five wounds
[26:18] because the fifth seal is heavenly
[26:20] representation
[26:22] and laboring grace
[26:25] heavenly representation
[26:27] and laboring grace
[26:30] those first four seals
[26:33] those first four horse riders put jesus
[26:36] laying down on the earth on a cross
[26:39] and tacked four nails three nails
[26:42] through four parts of his body
[26:44] the extremities of his body
[26:47] one through each hand one through each
[26:49] foot a total of four wounds
[26:53] but now
[26:56] now the scene changes
[26:59] because he's lifted from the earth
[27:02] and he's put into the heavens and the
[27:06] fifth seal is ran into the bottom of his
[27:09] heart and blood and water comes out
[27:12] that blood and that water was you and i
[27:15] saints
[27:16] and we did not come out on the earth
[27:18] because we are not an earthly people
[27:21] the jews are an earthly people that's
[27:23] why the jews says where did you get
[27:24] these scars in your hands
[27:30] the bride is a spiritual people they are
[27:32] heavenly people their representation is
[27:35] a heavenly being
[27:37] he's put into the heavens and that spear
[27:40] ran into his side brother branham said
[27:41] that he didn't die of the wounds he died
[27:43] of a broken heart he he said the
[27:46] chemistry of his body was so made that
[27:49] you and i could not have the reaction in
[27:51] our bodies that he had
[27:53] he said that it would be impossible for
[27:55] our blood and our water to do that only
[27:58] jesus christ was physically capable of
[28:00] the blood and the water separating in
[28:02] his body
[28:04] he said he did that he died of a broken
[28:07] heart
[28:10] his heart was so broken
[28:13] that the literal blood and water the
[28:15] chemistry of his body broke apart and
[28:18] separated and that's what killed him
[28:20] because the wounds did not kill him
[28:24] the wounds did not kill him and it's
[28:25] proven because the soldiers were coming
[28:27] to him because they needed to get him
[28:28] off the cross they needed to kill him
[28:30] they needed to finish killing him
[28:32] so they broke the legs of the others but
[28:34] when they come to him they said he's
[28:35] already dead
[28:39] but to make sure
[28:42] they thrust the spear into this side
[28:44] and the blood and the water comes out
[28:48] but brother branham says his body had a
[28:50] reaction that ours couldn't have because
[28:53] sea saints no matter how
[28:55] lonely you
[28:56] are and how depressed you are
[29:00] you can never be as lonely and depressed
[29:03] as he was
[29:05] because he was god
[29:08] see we can get as low as loki and i'm
[29:12] not belittling that we can get low i'm
[29:14] not saying it's not a real situation
[29:19] but we still have god to look to
[29:23] he came to the point that he says my
[29:25] father
[29:26] my father why hast thou forsaken me
[29:32] he got to the point that he
[29:34] his father had forsaken him and it
[29:37] caused he had no more hope saints he was
[29:40] done if if his father for if our
[29:42] heavenly father forsakes us you tell me
[29:44] what hope we have
[29:47] we are done
[29:48] but he comes to that situation and it
[29:51] causes see the reason we can't have that
[29:54] reaction in our body is because we can
[29:55] never get that low i say thank god
[29:59] thank god i can't have that reaction
[30:01] thank god that i no matter how low that
[30:03] we get we will always be able to look to
[30:05] him and have a hope
[30:07] but he has no hope and this causes a
[30:09] reaction that no other human being can
[30:11] have because no other human being can
[30:12] get in that position
[30:14] only he can
[30:16] and it separates and it causes his death
[30:19] but even though he's dead
[30:23] he is dead saints
[30:25] not struggling for life not a little bit
[30:27] of life he is dead
[30:30] and that's still not good enough
[30:34] now even though he's dead
[30:37] they take the spear and thrust it
[30:39] through his ribs
[30:40] into his heart and blood and water comes
[30:43] out
[30:44] brother branham says that we were
[30:45] identified in that blood and water he
[30:47] said because when they pierced his side
[30:49] they loosed the bride
[30:52] that was the whole
[30:54] purpose of that event
[30:59] they pierced that side
[31:01] where is the bride's position saints
[31:06] where was eve's position
[31:13] why didn't they stab him in the stomach
[31:14] why didn't they stab him in the head
[31:16] why didn't they stab him anywhere
[31:18] besides right in the heart of god
[31:24] don't ever belittle your position saints
[31:27] god himself thought so much of you and i
[31:30] that even after he had died
[31:33] he allowed a spear to be ran into his
[31:35] heart so that we wouldn't miss our
[31:37] position
[31:40] amen
[31:42] even after he was dead he had already
[31:45] paid the price
[31:46] there was no more price to be paid it
[31:48] was finished he said it was finished
[31:54] but i wonder he was really on his mind
[31:56] when he was on the cross
[32:00] that he would die of a broken heart
[32:02] and that still wasn't good enough he
[32:04] would allow them
[32:06] to run a spear into his heart and loose
[32:09] that fifth seal
[32:10] see all the other seals had been loose
[32:12] saints we just went through them all the
[32:14] other ones had been loosed
[32:17] but the fifth seal
[32:20] the fifth seal was heavenly
[32:21] representation
[32:23] and laboring grace
[32:26] and the fifth seal
[32:28] always goes into full manifestation
[32:32] after a crucifixion
[32:36] after
[32:38] a crucifixion
[32:41] let's go to the fourth seal brother
[32:42] branham
[32:44] speaking he says
[32:45] here's the fourth seal open and the
[32:47] rider to the four horses is revealed to
[32:49] the best of my knowledge i have to give
[32:51] a disclaimer here
[32:53] i'm leaning a little bit more towards
[32:54] teaching this morning as you can tell
[32:56] and brother brandon says when you go to
[32:58] teach and you're already on thin ice
[33:01] so he has to have a good pastor to keep
[33:02] him in line
[33:04] so i am perfectly fine if i get out of
[33:06] line for the pastor to correct me from
[33:10] the pulpit i have no shame he can come
[33:11] up and say brother benjamin said this
[33:13] and it's not right it's actually this
[33:15] now i have a real freedom and a liberty
[33:16] i can just speak my heart to you
[33:18] so i'm perfectly fine with that because
[33:20] it's it's not about being right saints
[33:23] it is about being right but it's not
[33:24] about being right for the sake of being
[33:26] right it's about really being right
[33:29] so we're leaning that way this morning
[33:31] and there's a lot of things that are
[33:32] heavy and they're deep and we're going
[33:33] to get into them and
[33:35] if i could just speak it the way that i
[33:37] see it in my heart there would be zero
[33:39] issues i know for a fact because the
[33:42] picture and the revelation is precise
[33:43] and it's pure and it's accurate
[33:45] but i'm immortal and i'm a human and i
[33:47] may say something wrong
[33:49] so i've got the pastor has full
[33:51] permission to clean up any mess that i
[33:53] make no shame on my part
[33:56] he says in the fourth seal it's open the
[33:58] riders the four horses is revealed to
[34:00] the best of my knowledge now this all
[34:02] takes place on earth
[34:04] speaking of the first four seals
[34:06] this all takes place on earth
[34:09] next seal we see is in heaven
[34:13] where souls under the altar now just in
[34:15] closing i want to say these few words
[34:17] here i got wrote down we have skipped
[34:18] about on these four seals now tomorrow
[34:21] night
[34:22] we change the scene from the earth
[34:24] things going on he looks up here
[34:29] and sees these souls under the altar the
[34:31] sacrifice altar he says we've been on
[34:34] earth dealing with these four seals the
[34:36] first four seals but he says tomorrow
[34:38] night when we come to the fifth seal the
[34:39] scene changes
[34:43] it's no more earthly
[34:45] it's
[34:47] he's saying this in the fourth seal so
[34:49] they'll come with a prepared mind
[34:52] because if you approach the for the
[34:54] fifth seal
[34:56] with earthly thinking you'll never catch
[34:58] it
[35:00] he says the scene changes
[35:05] and it goes into the heavenlies
[35:08] see this is this is why jesus had to be
[35:10] lifted off of the earth by the four
[35:13] horse riders and put into heaven
[35:15] because the scene was changing
[35:18] the pattern had already been laid down
[35:20] in the seals see the word was written
[35:22] the seals were written well before jesus
[35:24] arrived on earth
[35:26] the principles and the pattern is
[35:28] already there
[35:29] when he comes he's going to come in that
[35:30] pattern
[35:31] when we come we're going to come in that
[35:33] pattern the pattern is not going to
[35:35] change
[35:37] they couldn't have left jesus jesus
[35:39] could not have died while he was laying
[35:41] on the earth on that cross
[35:43] he had to be lifted into the heavens
[35:47] had to be
[35:50] and that's why john was the only one to
[35:51] record that
[35:54] because john was the only one that was
[35:55] lifted into the heavens to see it
[35:58] and now brother branham comes to preach
[36:00] the seals and he thinks it's important
[36:02] to let them know when they're finishing
[36:03] up the fourth seal that the scene is
[36:04] changing and we're going into the
[36:05] heavenly dimension tomorrow
[36:07] i wonder why he thinks that's important
[36:12] because he
[36:13] sees the pattern in the scripture
[36:15] clearly
[36:17] we change the scene from the earth
[36:19] things going
[36:20] he looks up here the souls under the
[36:22] altar
[36:28] the fourth seal
[36:30] spiritual death
[36:33] why did there have to be four soldiers
[36:35] at the foot of the cross
[36:40] fluke
[36:42] somebody called off work
[36:46] no saints
[36:50] it was there so we wouldn't miss it
[36:53] the four
[36:54] lifted him off of the earth into the
[36:56] heavens i'm not making that up it's in
[36:58] the scripture there were four soldiers
[37:00] you can go back and look at that
[37:07] the
[37:08] the spiritual death
[37:11] of the clergy in that day
[37:14] was what put him on that cross
[37:16] there were four soldiers
[37:19] tacked him to that cross
[37:21] lifted him up into the heavens
[37:26] when we see in this situation if we can
[37:30] just grasp
[37:31] if the word of god is so
[37:34] precise
[37:36] and so
[37:37] perfect
[37:40] that it's right down to these nitty
[37:42] gritty details
[37:45] that there has to be four soldiers and
[37:48] they have to lift him off the earth to
[37:50] run to display the fifth seal by
[37:52] creating that fifth wound in his side
[37:57] this is not just some ideas we're
[37:59] following saints
[38:01] this is so profoundly perfect it's
[38:03] astonishing
[38:06] and you can look at that on one hand and
[38:08] say okay well so what
[38:10] but if you catch the principle under
[38:12] that
[38:14] you can look at and apply it to you
[38:17] that if he's that accurate and that
[38:19] precise over these little bitty details
[38:23] what about his bride
[38:26] what about your life
[38:29] what about my life
[38:31] is there anything going on by chance
[38:35] if he's that concerned about these
[38:38] little details
[38:41] if his eye is on the sparrow
[38:44] what does he think about the details of
[38:46] what you're going through right now
[38:48] you think it's by chance
[38:51] i would say
[38:53] that if you would get out of carnal
[38:55] thinking
[38:56] and get into heavenly atmosphere you'll
[38:58] probably see how some of these seals are
[39:00] being displayed in that situation you're
[39:02] in right now
[39:05] i would venture to say that's true
[39:10] john's the only one to catch this fifth
[39:12] and seventh seal because the fifth and
[39:14] the seventh seal is where the bride's
[39:15] located
[39:17] we know the bride's located in the
[39:18] anointings that combat the horse riders
[39:24] but you're not identified in that seal
[39:26] are you identified on a white horse with
[39:28] deception
[39:29] a red horse taking peace
[39:32] a black horse of spiritual famine you're
[39:33] not identified there you've remember
[39:36] brother brown says the seals loose the
[39:37] entire bible and the end of time message
[39:40] was this revelation of the seals so
[39:42] everything is encompassed in the seals
[39:44] so if you exist
[39:47] you're in the seals
[39:49] you pick which one you want to be in
[39:51] i don't want to be in any of the first
[39:53] four
[39:56] i sure don't want to be under a judgment
[39:57] seal
[39:58] we know that that judgment still has an
[40:00] effect on the believer to bring them
[40:01] back
[40:03] but i'm not identified in trials and
[40:05] tribulation
[40:06] i'm identified
[40:08] in the fifth seal of grace
[40:10] and the seventh seal of his coming and
[40:13] completion
[40:14] that's where i'm identified at so those
[40:16] are the ones that john
[40:18] funny
[40:19] those are the ones that john only john
[40:22] speaks about
[40:25] because that's john's message
[40:30] let's go to
[40:34] john 12.
[40:41] john chapter 12 verse 20.
[40:45] i know i'm not running around up here
[40:47] and jumping and screaming and clapping
[40:49] my hands and sweating up a storm
[40:52] but that really won't do you any good
[40:53] truth be told
[40:55] what will do you good if you catch the
[40:57] spiritual principle under this seal
[41:01] that's what will do us good
[41:05] john 12 and 20.
[41:07] and there were certain greeks
[41:09] now up to this point they've been
[41:11] dealing in the jewish country they've
[41:12] been dealing with jews but now at this
[41:15] point in john 12
[41:16] here comes some gentiles
[41:20] i wonder if the scene's changing
[41:24] verse 20 and there were certain greeks
[41:27] among them that came up to worship at
[41:29] the feast
[41:30] and the same came therefore to philip
[41:32] which was of bethesda of galilee and
[41:33] desired of him saying sir we would see
[41:35] jesus
[41:38] philip cometh and telleth andrew and
[41:39] again andrew and philip tell jesus and
[41:42] jesus answered them saying
[41:44] the hour has come that the son of man
[41:46] should be glorified
[41:52] gentiles come and say we want to see
[41:54] jesus
[41:56] and jesus's response is okay yeah bring
[41:58] him on over
[41:59] no
[42:01] no it wasn't
[42:02] his response when his deci his his
[42:05] disciples come to him and said there's
[42:07] gentiles wanting to see you
[42:09] his immediate response
[42:11] it is the hour for the son of man to be
[42:13] glorified
[42:19] you think he said this by chance
[42:22] no
[42:24] no he knows the scene is about to change
[42:29] the son of it is the hour the hour has
[42:32] come that the son of man should be
[42:34] glorified that is his response when a
[42:37] gentile comes to him
[42:40] verily verily i say unto you
[42:43] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[42:45] ground and die it abideth alone but if
[42:47] it die it bringeth forth much fruit
[42:50] he that loveth his life shall lose and
[42:52] he that hateth his life in this world
[42:53] shall keep it unto eternal life if any
[42:56] man serve me let me follow let him
[42:58] follow me and where i am there also my
[43:01] servant be if any man serve me him will
[43:04] my father honor
[43:06] now is my soul troubled and what shall i
[43:09] say father save me from this hour but
[43:11] for this hour but for this cause i came
[43:14] unto this hour
[43:16] i thought he said the son of man was
[43:17] going to be glorified
[43:23] there's nothing glorious sounding about
[43:25] that to me
[43:28] a corn of wheat unless it falls in and
[43:29] dies it abideth alone
[43:33] he that hateth his life and loses it
[43:38] he just said it's the hour the son of
[43:40] man should be glorified
[43:43] see god's interpretation of glory and
[43:46] glorification is his word being
[43:48] fulfilled
[43:51] not us walking around with a smile on
[43:53] our face skipping our heels on the
[43:55] clouds all the time
[43:57] we have to take a scriptural
[43:59] definition of what he means
[44:03] and he gives it to us
[44:05] immediately gentiles come son of man is
[44:07] to be glorified unless a corn of wheat
[44:09] fall into the ground and die it abideth
[44:11] alone forever
[44:15] i'm skipping ahead
[44:17] but this is the first crucifixion
[44:20] and remember we had a prophet come and
[44:21] given an indictment for a second
[44:23] crucifixion
[44:26] what pattern do you think that's going
[44:28] to follow
[44:30] what glorification do you think that
[44:32] bride's going to receive
[44:40] if any man no let's skip on down
[44:43] father verse 28 father glorify thy name
[44:48] then came there a voice from heaven
[44:50] saying i have both glorified it and i
[44:52] will glorify it again the people
[44:55] therefore that stood by and heard it
[44:56] said that it thundered
[44:59] it thundered
[45:01] while he's speaking to these about these
[45:03] gentiles
[45:06] that's probably coincidence
[45:08] others said an angel spoke to him
[45:11] oh
[45:12] that's probably coincidence too because
[45:14] there surely wouldn't be an angel
[45:16] speaking about thunders when there's a
[45:17] gentile present
[45:20] it is so precise it's shocking saints
[45:24] it is shocking
[45:28] and jesus answered and said the voice
[45:30] came not because of me but for your
[45:32] sakes
[45:36] therefore i send you elijah prophet
[45:38] and if i don't
[45:40] i will smite the earth with a curse
[45:42] it didn't come for his sake
[45:44] it came for our sake
[45:48] now is the judgment of this world now
[45:51] shall the prince of this world be castel
[45:53] verse 32 and i
[45:56] if
[45:59] if
[46:00] i be lifted up from the earth
[46:03] will draw all men
[46:05] unto me
[46:07] you tell me how important it was that he
[46:10] was lifted up from the earth
[46:12] you tell me how important it was that he
[46:14] displayed that fifth seal of heavenly
[46:17] representation not earthly
[46:19] representation heavenly representation
[46:22] at the time of his crucifixion
[46:24] if i
[46:27] be lifted up
[46:30] from the earth
[46:35] i will draw all men unto me
[46:40] if i be lifted up from the earth
[46:43] we know that those first four horse
[46:45] riders overlapped the church ages
[46:48] and rode through the church ages i'm
[46:50] speaking specifically about
[46:52] that
[46:53] context now
[46:56] those those horse riders
[46:59] rode through the church ages
[47:01] but jesus says if i be lifted up from
[47:04] the earth i'll draw all men unto me
[47:06] how important do you think it is that
[47:09] the end of chapter 3
[47:12] at the end of the laodicean church age
[47:14] that voice says to john come up higher
[47:20] how important do you think it is that we
[47:22] come up higher
[47:26] because jesus says if i be lifted up
[47:29] from the earth
[47:30] i will draw all men unto you me
[47:32] how do you think that you're going to be
[47:34] drawn under him under a laodicean
[47:36] condition
[47:38] it is totally against the pattern of the
[47:41] word of god from genesis to revelation
[47:44] it will not work we are a spiritual
[47:48] people we have got to get into a
[47:50] spiritual dimension
[47:53] have to
[47:55] and that spiritual dimension will only
[47:58] come
[47:59] by going through that open door and
[48:01] there is only one person that opened
[48:03] that door and that was the lamb through
[48:05] his vindicated prophet
[48:09] nothing else will work
[48:10] anything else will leave you in an
[48:12] earthly condition and you will not be
[48:15] drawn to him
[48:17] it is impossible
[48:21] in the fifth seal
[48:25] this is where i want to
[48:26] re remind you to reflect back
[48:31] on the principles
[48:33] on the key that was given us for those
[48:35] other seals where brother branham would
[48:37] loose it in the parables
[48:39] look how simply he loses this seal to us
[48:42] he comes to paragraph 44 right at the
[48:44] beginning of the seal
[48:46] some of the best friends that i know are
[48:47] catholics do you realize and the man may
[48:50] be sitting here tonight perhaps is the
[48:52] only way that we got this tabernacle
[48:54] built because a roman catholic stood on
[48:57] his feet in the court there and went to
[48:59] the front for me
[49:00] boy like nobody would do
[49:03] that's right and they couldn't turn it
[49:05] down
[49:08] well that's nice we appreciate that
[49:09] brother
[49:10] he just loosed the seal saints
[49:14] see the seal oh god help me
[49:18] the seal was not the information
[49:21] written in let me say the seal was just
[49:25] not was not just the information written
[49:29] there in chapter six
[49:31] adam didn't remember the seals that were
[49:33] restored to us is what adam lost
[49:35] adam did not walk around in the garden
[49:37] with a book
[49:38] that says the sixth seal is such and
[49:40] such the fifth seal is this this
[49:43] adam walked around with spiritual
[49:45] principles
[49:47] brother branham says that in the garden
[49:48] of eden there was those two trees
[49:50] standing there in the church book and he
[49:52] says those were not literal
[49:54] trees those were those represented
[49:57] spiritual principles
[50:01] so when we come to this fifth seal
[50:04] the information that is laying there in
[50:07] symbolic form yes that has to be
[50:09] interpreted yes that has to be loosed
[50:12] but the seal itself is anytime the
[50:16] spiritual principle that is under that
[50:19] seal is being spoken about that is when
[50:21] that seal is being loosed does that make
[50:24] sense
[50:25] so now we can clearly see here in
[50:26] paragraph 44 he just loosed the fifth
[50:29] seal because the fifth seal is heavenly
[50:32] representation and laboring grace
[50:35] see he's telling a story about how this
[50:37] roman catholic this dear friend of his
[50:40] went to the court for him
[50:43] and he went to the front for him like
[50:46] nobody else could do
[50:49] nobody else could do this
[50:52] nobody else
[50:53] nobody else was found worthy to do this
[51:00] but when he did they could not turn it
[51:03] down
[51:08] i thought he was telling a story about
[51:09] how this man helped him get the
[51:10] tabernacle he was
[51:13] and if you stay on earth that's all
[51:15] you'll get but if you will allow him to
[51:17] be lifted up before you
[51:19] you will be drawn to him and you will
[51:21] see
[51:23] what is he really saying to a spiritual
[51:26] people
[51:28] it's not that he's not really saying
[51:30] this about the tabernacle he really is
[51:33] but that is not what we're after what
[51:35] we're after is we want the seal loosed
[51:38] we want the seal loose and he's loosing
[51:40] it
[51:41] let's not just think he's telling us
[51:43] stories
[51:45] heavenly representation this roman
[51:47] catholic went to the front for him
[51:50] stood like nobody else could do
[51:52] and when he did
[51:54] they could not
[51:55] turn him down
[51:58] skips down to verse i'm sorry paragraph
[52:02] 46. just a few paragraphs after that a
[52:06] boy that is catholic a real royal friend
[52:08] of mine was talking to me remember those
[52:10] are those key phrases we're looking for
[52:11] when we're reading those seals whenever
[52:13] he says now the other day i was
[52:16] just the other day i was talking to sojo
[52:18] there it is saints
[52:20] go back and read your seals book it's
[52:22] there every time he's getting ready to
[52:25] loose the seal
[52:28] was talking to me he had a certain
[52:30] hardware store before i left he said
[52:32] billy i know you don't believe in our
[52:33] system of religion he said but i'm
[52:34] telling you right now god has honored
[52:37] your prayers so much for us i believe
[52:39] that if you get in trouble
[52:43] has anybody been in trouble
[52:48] anywhere in the nation
[52:50] said every catholic in the country would
[52:52] come to you
[52:56] have you ever been in trouble that you
[52:58] needed somebody to come to you
[53:00] spiritually speaking saints
[53:02] we know those things happen natural but
[53:04] spiritually speaking have we ever been
[53:06] in a condition of trouble
[53:09] that we needed somebody to come to our
[53:11] rescue we needed some type of assistance
[53:15] from another dimension
[53:16] we needed some type of heavenly
[53:18] representation we needed somebody to
[53:21] come and go to the front for us like
[53:23] nobody else can do
[53:25] and not be turned down
[53:32] paragraph 134
[53:34] i read the other day
[53:37] you did
[53:39] that's interesting
[53:41] what did you read brother branham
[53:43] tell me another story
[53:46] i would have loved to have been sitting
[53:48] there with the understanding that we
[53:50] have now
[53:52] because when he would have said this i
[53:54] would have probably laughed and i would
[53:56] probably say no you're not going to fool
[53:58] me i know what you're getting ready to
[53:59] do
[54:01] and he would have enjoyed it
[54:03] i know he would have enjoyed it
[54:05] i read the other day the letter that
[54:08] mary herself wrote to polycarp remember
[54:10] saints let me back up for a second
[54:12] remember he's in the fifth seal he's
[54:14] talking about jews under the altar
[54:19] what does this
[54:21] and what i just wrote read to you have
[54:23] to do with jews under the altar
[54:28] seals are to gentiles
[54:32] trumpets are to jews
[54:35] seals are to gentiles
[54:39] even if it looks like it's to jews
[54:42] because what the seal is is a spiritual
[54:46] principle
[54:47] and if god wants to use jews to unlock a
[54:51] spiritual principle and a seal to his
[54:53] gentile bride he can do that
[54:56] and if he wants to use a trumpet that
[54:58] looks like it's to a gentile to loose it
[55:01] to bring christ to the jews he can do
[55:04] that as well
[55:08] brother branham said seals are to
[55:10] gentiles trumpets are to jews
[55:13] it doesn't matter if we think it looks
[55:16] opposite brother branham said seals are
[55:19] to gentiles trumpets are to jews
[55:22] and if we allow that to be true whenever
[55:25] we pick up this fifth seal we'll no
[55:27] longer say oh saul is under the altar
[55:29] what's the sixth seal about no we'll say
[55:31] oh fifth seal sun souls under the altar
[55:34] what is the spiritual principle of that
[55:36] to me a gentile
[55:39] that's the question to ask
[55:42] i was reading the other day the letter
[55:45] mary herself wrote to polycarp
[55:46] commending him for being a gallup man
[55:48] that who could teach and accept the
[55:50] teaching of jesus christ of who was born
[55:52] of her from god
[55:53] polycarp was burned and on his road
[55:56] coming down he was walking with his head
[55:58] down and the roman centurion said you're
[56:00] an old man and well respected why don't
[56:02] you denounce that thing he just kept
[56:04] looking towards heaven
[56:08] and a voice spoke
[56:11] from somewhere
[56:13] they couldn't understand where and said
[56:16] polycarp
[56:18] don't fear
[56:20] i
[56:21] am
[56:22] with
[56:23] you
[56:26] why is he telling this story
[56:28] while he's preaching the fifth seal
[56:31] polycarp is coming down to be burned at
[56:33] the stake
[56:35] and there is a voice from heaven
[56:37] that comes and says polycarp do not fear
[56:40] i am with you
[56:46] well if he's with me what do i have to
[56:49] fear
[56:52] it's the spiritual principle
[56:55] under the seal
[56:56] that's being loose to us
[57:01] polycarp is on his way down to be burned
[57:03] at the stake
[57:06] this is a natural event
[57:08] this is going to take place on earth
[57:12] you tell me
[57:14] one thing
[57:16] on earth that could have gave him
[57:18] comfort
[57:24] nothing
[57:27] why didn't the scripture say or why
[57:28] didn't it say that the voice spoke to
[57:30] him from earth
[57:32] it's not an earthly voice we're looking
[57:34] for saints
[57:35] an earthly voice won't help us
[57:39] an earthly voice won't help us unless
[57:41] it's backed by heaven
[57:45] but if it's spoken heaven first an
[57:47] earthly voice is just a microphone that
[57:48] picks it up and gives it to us it'll do
[57:50] us a lot of good
[57:55] a voice spoke from heaven and said
[57:56] polycarp don't fear
[57:59] i am with you
[58:04] don't leave that at polycarp saints
[58:07] we all have earthly problems
[58:11] we all were going to have problems
[58:14] that there will be no earthly answer to
[58:18] if you haven't had them yet you will
[58:20] have them if you aren't having them
[58:22] right now you will have them
[58:25] i assure you of that
[58:28] each and every one of us are going to
[58:31] face earthly
[58:33] real
[58:34] problems they're not going to be made up
[58:36] they are going to be real you are going
[58:38] to cry yourself to sleep at night you
[58:40] are going to worry about it throughout
[58:42] the day it is going to be real and it is
[58:44] going to be earthly it is going to be
[58:46] natural and it is going to be tangible
[58:51] some of those you may be able to fix
[58:52] yourself
[58:54] but i assure you each and every one of
[58:57] us
[58:57] will have at least one
[59:00] that we can't fix
[59:05] because we're the gentile broad
[59:07] and as christ displayed all the seals we
[59:09] have to display all the seals
[59:12] and we are going to be put in that
[59:13] position to where we have to have
[59:17] heavenly assistance
[59:19] we have to have a heavenly
[59:22] representation come and help us with
[59:24] that problem like nobody else can
[59:27] we can look at that in the broad
[59:30] spiritual application and that's true
[59:33] we know that's true christ came he died
[59:35] on a cross for us he came from heaven he
[59:37] died on a cross from us for us he paid
[59:39] our price and he went back to glory we
[59:41] know that's in a broad sense but it's
[59:44] going to be precise in your life
[59:46] it is going to be specific to you
[59:49] your brother and your sister will not be
[59:51] able to help you with that one
[59:53] because this fifth seal
[59:56] god is going to make sure you have a
[59:59] revelation of this fifth seal
[1:00:02] god is going to make sure you have a
[1:00:04] revelation that you personally have
[1:00:07] heavenly representation
[1:00:11] he will make sure that
[1:00:19] paragraph 319
[1:00:20] in the fifth seal
[1:00:22] brother branham says five
[1:00:24] if you know your numerals of the bible
[1:00:28] five is the number of laboring grace
[1:00:33] we knew it was the number of grace
[1:00:36] but he puts a definition here
[1:00:39] laboring
[1:00:40] grace
[1:00:46] and that's what he has done
[1:00:49] now watch
[1:00:50] you want to know where it is
[1:00:54] nah
[1:00:55] now i'm hungry
[1:01:01] he's preaching the fifth seal
[1:01:03] he says what's your numbers five is the
[1:01:06] number of labor and grace do you want to
[1:01:08] know where it is
[1:01:10] yes brother branham i most certainly do
[1:01:13] want to know where it is where
[1:01:15] is the revelation of this seal
[1:01:18] was jesus a labor of love i'm sorry was
[1:01:22] jesus a labor of grace
[1:01:26] j e s u s
[1:01:29] five
[1:01:30] l a b o r five is that right
[1:01:35] labor for love for you
[1:01:39] and if you get to him
[1:01:41] how do you come
[1:01:43] by what
[1:01:45] f a i t h
[1:01:47] n
[1:01:48] l a b o r
[1:01:51] faith in
[1:01:53] labor
[1:01:54] is that right
[1:01:56] labor is the number of grace
[1:02:02] that's what he said he didn't say five
[1:02:03] is the number of grace he said labor
[1:02:06] is the number of grace
[1:02:09] all right to
[1:02:11] the believer
[1:02:15] faith
[1:02:16] in what he has done through his labor
[1:02:20] it is the foundational
[1:02:23] cornerstone of any true walk with christ
[1:02:28] if you cannot have faith
[1:02:30] perfect faith
[1:02:33] in what in the simplicity of the gospel
[1:02:36] just christianity 101 if you could not
[1:02:39] have perfect faith
[1:02:41] in what he labored to do for you and
[1:02:45] paid that penalty in full regardless of
[1:02:48] anything you have done or will do you
[1:02:51] will never walk with christ
[1:02:54] it is impossible
[1:02:56] brother random just said so he says if
[1:02:58] you come to him how will you come
[1:03:01] faith in labor
[1:03:04] you have to have a perfect revelation of
[1:03:06] that
[1:03:09] remember he also says in the church age
[1:03:11] book if you if you accept that
[1:03:14] you also accept the fact that you are
[1:03:16] his righteousness
[1:03:19] he says to reject one is to reject the
[1:03:22] other
[1:03:24] see that's how you can check your
[1:03:25] revelation if you really have a true
[1:03:27] perfect faith in what he's done for you
[1:03:30] is if you can look yourself in the
[1:03:32] mirror
[1:03:34] and say i have perfect faith that i am
[1:03:36] the very righteousness of god
[1:03:39] because if there's a hiccup in that you
[1:03:41] need to go back and check your first
[1:03:42] revelation and faith in what he did
[1:03:46] because you don't have it yet
[1:03:49] if you do not brother branham said so
[1:03:51] and i'm not making that up it's in the
[1:03:52] church age book he says if you accept
[1:03:54] one you have to accept the other if you
[1:03:56] reject one you have to reject the other
[1:03:58] they are intertwined you cannot have one
[1:04:00] without the other
[1:04:02] that's how you can check your revelation
[1:04:06] and it's not that we're not going to
[1:04:07] slip up and mess up and make mistakes
[1:04:09] brother branham says you will even
[1:04:11] willfully sin i'm not going to try to
[1:04:13] preach on that because i don't have a
[1:04:14] clue how that works but he says you will
[1:04:16] even willfully sin
[1:04:21] but a perfect revelation
[1:04:24] of of perfect faith
[1:04:28] in the labor that christ displayed
[1:04:31] will fix that problem
[1:04:34] it will fix it every time
[1:04:37] faith
[1:04:38] in labor
[1:04:41] comes down to paragraph 345
[1:04:44] he says
[1:04:45] now my time's exactly up
[1:04:48] if i let out a little little early
[1:04:50] but i got a few more little things to
[1:04:52] say if you can stand it
[1:04:57] okay
[1:04:58] if you have to
[1:05:01] it's
[1:05:02] it's just comical saints thank god for a
[1:05:04] revelation i mean no doubt there were
[1:05:06] people sitting in this meeting that
[1:05:08] couldn't stand it
[1:05:09] i mean seriously there had to have been
[1:05:12] people you know they had their supper
[1:05:13] cooking they had friends coming over
[1:05:15] they had plans they had a long trip back
[1:05:17] home whatever the situation was no doubt
[1:05:19] there was somebody sitting there that
[1:05:21] couldn't stand anymore
[1:05:23] but we can look at this now and we're
[1:05:24] like i got you
[1:05:26] i got you i know what you're fixing to
[1:05:28] do right here
[1:05:30] i've got a few more little things to say
[1:05:32] here if you can stand it
[1:05:35] i know it's hot and i'm sweating but
[1:05:37] listen i just got something to tell you
[1:05:39] it's just so good it's just burning
[1:05:41] right in my heart i hope you haven't
[1:05:43] forgotten it
[1:05:47] let me say this in the presence of him
[1:05:51] oh my
[1:05:53] oh my
[1:05:55] by his grace
[1:05:59] what's the fifth seal
[1:06:02] by his grace he also let me see my
[1:06:06] people
[1:06:08] now remember he just spent hours talking
[1:06:10] about souls under the altar the jews
[1:06:13] under the altar
[1:06:14] but then he comes to the closing says
[1:06:16] i've got a few more little things to
[1:06:17] tell you if you can stand it i hope you
[1:06:19] haven't forgotten it
[1:06:21] by his grace
[1:06:23] he also let me see my people
[1:06:27] oh he did
[1:06:29] tell me more
[1:06:32] not long ago in white robes
[1:06:37] what were those souls under the altar
[1:06:38] given
[1:06:41] wonder if that's a coincidence i am not
[1:06:43] going to go start preaching on robes
[1:06:45] because we will be here for six hours
[1:06:48] you
[1:06:49] study that yourself praise god
[1:06:51] i'll preach on it some other time if our
[1:06:52] pastor don't
[1:06:54] you remember it
[1:06:56] you remember the story
[1:06:58] not long ago the gentile bride
[1:07:01] they're there
[1:07:03] now
[1:07:05] okay this is not a wishy-washy statement
[1:07:08] saints this is an emphatic direct
[1:07:10] statement
[1:07:13] they're there
[1:07:14] now
[1:07:17] what did he just reference before that
[1:07:19] the gentile bride
[1:07:24] i'm not going to put you in or are you
[1:07:26] out you put yourself in or out i'm going
[1:07:28] to put myself in there though
[1:07:31] you say well i don't know how that works
[1:07:33] i haven't died yet quit worrying about
[1:07:35] how it works
[1:07:37] it's a paradox
[1:07:41] but he's vindicated and me and you
[1:07:43] aren't
[1:07:44] yet
[1:07:47] they're there
[1:07:49] now
[1:07:51] paragraph 390 and so he said he's
[1:07:54] referring back to this
[1:07:57] translation
[1:07:58] he calls it a vision a couple times and
[1:08:00] he says no i don't want to call it a
[1:08:01] vision but i don't want to say
[1:08:02] translation because people will think
[1:08:03] i'm making myself like paul
[1:08:07] he's he's referring back to this
[1:08:09] situation i'll say it that way
[1:08:13] he says and the people said you he said
[1:08:15] i want to see jesus if i'm here i want
[1:08:17] to see jesus he says you can't see him
[1:08:20] now he's still higher see it was below
[1:08:23] the altar
[1:08:28] oh that's where the jews were at
[1:08:32] and that's where you saw the gentile
[1:08:33] bride
[1:08:35] maybe this fifth seal is not just about
[1:08:37] jews under the altar
[1:08:40] but this is just a little thing he has
[1:08:42] to tell us if we can stand it it's not
[1:08:44] really that important
[1:08:46] so don't get excited
[1:08:50] praise the lord i'm already do back
[1:08:51] flips
[1:08:54] they're below the altar yet i'm going to
[1:08:56] preach now praise the lord the sixth
[1:08:58] place where man goes not the seventh
[1:09:01] where god is seventh dimension they're
[1:09:04] in the sixth
[1:09:05] and they were all there and they was
[1:09:08] passing by and i said looked like there
[1:09:10] were actually millions of them
[1:09:14] what a group
[1:09:15] what a crowd
[1:09:17] and his earthly ministry hasn't even
[1:09:19] ended yet but yet he's already got
[1:09:21] millions of his people over there
[1:09:24] that's interesting
[1:09:27] his people
[1:09:29] are these branhams no these aren't
[1:09:31] branhams these are your converts these
[1:09:34] are your people
[1:09:38] now the scripture
[1:09:40] he that accepts a prophet in the name of
[1:09:42] a prophet receives a prophet's reward
[1:09:44] takes on a whole new light
[1:09:48] what was brother branham's reward
[1:09:50] remember the the prophecy interpretation
[1:09:52] through danny henry a huge portion of
[1:09:55] heaven awaits thee
[1:09:57] brethren says well
[1:09:58] it's not sectioned off like i owned this
[1:10:01] much and i'm this much
[1:10:03] heaven consists of the word
[1:10:07] and what are the believers the words on
[1:10:10] the page the words in the book
[1:10:15] the loose words in the book
[1:10:18] the spiritual principles under the seals
[1:10:22] which in is the entire bible which is
[1:10:25] the last angel's message
[1:10:32] see i'm not ashamed to say that i am
[1:10:34] william branham brother william
[1:10:36] branham's people
[1:10:41] and if you're ashamed of that i got real
[1:10:42] serious questions
[1:10:46] he that will receive a prophet in the
[1:10:48] name of a prophet it doesn't say to
[1:10:50] receive a prophet in the name of god
[1:10:53] it says he that will receive a prophet
[1:10:54] in the name of a prophet will receive a
[1:10:56] prophet's reward i am not ashamed to be
[1:11:00] identified with him
[1:11:02] i am not a sh i'm not a brand of might
[1:11:05] but i'm not ashamed to be called a brand
[1:11:07] of knight
[1:11:08] i am a christian
[1:11:10] but if you want to call me a branhamite
[1:11:12] and you want to call me whatever word it
[1:11:14] is that associates me with him
[1:11:16] i
[1:11:17] praise god
[1:11:19] that just puts me in this vision
[1:11:21] this translation it puts me in this
[1:11:24] dimension
[1:11:25] [Applause]
[1:11:27] i'm not ashamed of that dimension and
[1:11:30] anything that it entails
[1:11:36] paragraph 411
[1:11:39] oh this is wonderful
[1:11:40] see
[1:11:42] we're
[1:11:43] right under the altar
[1:11:49] that's almost like he's saying present
[1:11:50] tense
[1:11:52] we're right under the altar see
[1:11:55] that see where were we at when christ
[1:11:58] was here on earth
[1:12:01] where did the spear go
[1:12:04] it went right under the altar for what
[1:12:06] purpose to loose the bride
[1:12:09] why would we have a problem wrapping our
[1:12:11] minds that we're right under the altar
[1:12:13] we were right under the altar before the
[1:12:15] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[1:12:17] of the world where do you think we were
[1:12:19] then
[1:12:20] i'm to say maybe under the altar
[1:12:23] where were we when he was here literally
[1:12:25] in a physical body
[1:12:27] he proved it by running that fifth that
[1:12:29] fifth wound up into his side it showed
[1:12:31] where we were at
[1:12:34] the book of revelation that was praised
[1:12:36] god the book of revelation that was
[1:12:38] given to john was to do what
[1:12:40] three things show what
[1:12:42] has been
[1:12:43] what is and what will come
[1:12:46] why can we always believe what is i'm
[1:12:49] sorry what has been
[1:12:51] no problems with what has been when we
[1:12:53] start getting to what is and what will
[1:12:55] be oh boy better be careful
[1:12:58] no saints if you have a
[1:13:01] revelation of what has been
[1:13:04] you have no fear of what is and what
[1:13:07] will be
[1:13:08] i was in the same place before the
[1:13:10] foundation of the world that i was when
[1:13:12] he was here on earth and i am now in the
[1:13:15] sa
[1:13:16] in the position that i will be
[1:13:19] same place my
[1:13:21] my and your position never changes it is
[1:13:25] right under the heart of god
[1:13:27] [Applause]
[1:13:28] amen
[1:13:31] you tell me how that mistake
[1:13:34] i'll say it real harshly you tell me how
[1:13:37] that willful sin that you did two weeks
[1:13:39] ago is going to change that pattern
[1:13:41] [Applause]
[1:13:43] you're trying to tell me that your
[1:13:45] hybrid human willful
[1:13:48] carnal self
[1:13:51] can somehow disrupt the entire mind of
[1:13:54] god
[1:13:57] your position is sure your pos my
[1:14:00] position is sure there is nothing we can
[1:14:03] do to change that position
[1:14:06] you say well what about that scripture
[1:14:08] in hebrews where it says if you
[1:14:09] willfully sin you bypass and there's no
[1:14:11] more
[1:14:12] brother bran says that don't even apply
[1:14:14] to a believer
[1:14:16] oh
[1:14:19] praise god
[1:14:21] if you want to put yourself in that
[1:14:22] chapter you go ahead i'm not putting
[1:14:24] myself in that chapter
[1:14:27] our position will not change god made
[1:14:30] sure it wouldn't change to the fact that
[1:14:31] he would send a prophet and say that
[1:14:32] portion of scripture does not apply to
[1:14:34] my bride
[1:14:35] because it's impossible for them to get
[1:14:37] there
[1:14:39] praise god for that
[1:14:42] i hope you're starting to see how the
[1:14:44] fifth seal was not just some jews that
[1:14:46] was killed by eichmann stalin mussolini
[1:14:49] and hitler under this altar
[1:14:51] wanting vengeance for their brothers
[1:14:54] what principle did it lose to us
[1:14:57] it loosed us that there's living people
[1:15:00] in that dimension
[1:15:02] and the same dimension that john saw
[1:15:04] those people in
[1:15:06] is the same dimension that brother
[1:15:07] branham saw me and you in
[1:15:11] study the message
[1:15:13] study the message
[1:15:15] tell me if i'm out in left field
[1:15:18] you tell me i'm open to that
[1:15:20] it's
[1:15:21] it's not
[1:15:22] just in the message it's through the
[1:15:24] scripture saints
[1:15:28] to the point
[1:15:30] that
[1:15:31] that there had to be four soldiers
[1:15:34] lift him into the heavens before they
[1:15:37] could display the fifth seal
[1:15:39] it's so precise it's shocking
[1:15:45] 411 see we're right under the altar see
[1:15:48] that was it
[1:15:51] we're right under the altar he's not
[1:15:53] stuttering he says it twice
[1:15:55] we're right under the altar waiting for
[1:15:57] the coming
[1:15:58] when he
[1:16:00] when
[1:16:00] go get the body sleeping in the dust to
[1:16:03] raise us again
[1:16:05] again i'm not going to get into the
[1:16:07] whole body's
[1:16:09] side channel i'm going to try not to get
[1:16:11] into the whole body's side channel of
[1:16:13] this because we just don't have time for
[1:16:15] that
[1:16:16] what i want you to catch is the
[1:16:18] principle under this fifth seal
[1:16:21] of heavenly representation
[1:16:24] it's not a frivolous representation
[1:16:26] saints
[1:16:27] that representation is more real than me
[1:16:30] and you sitting and standing here today
[1:16:33] that
[1:16:34] representation is the whole
[1:16:37] reason you're able to sit there and me
[1:16:39] stand here today
[1:16:41] it is more real than what's happening
[1:16:44] right now
[1:16:48] it's not just a thought it's not just a
[1:16:50] myth it's not just uh i hope that's
[1:16:52] right or that's exciting i wish it's
[1:16:54] that way no saints that is the reality
[1:16:58] this is the vapor
[1:17:02] paragraph 4 32.
[1:17:07] i'm going to have you stand up
[1:17:10] with me
[1:17:11] i'm nowhere near done but i want to get
[1:17:13] your blood circulating again
[1:17:17] while we read this and then i'll have
[1:17:18] you sit down
[1:17:21] 4 32 it says i just thought it would be
[1:17:24] a good place to inject that just before
[1:17:26] closing see
[1:17:28] if john looked over there
[1:17:30] and then was his brethren
[1:17:33] see his brethren that he had that had to
[1:17:35] suffer a little then see the lord
[1:17:38] permitted to see my brethren and the
[1:17:40] saints that were waiting for the coming
[1:17:42] of the lord
[1:17:44] are you his brother
[1:17:46] are you waiting for the coming of the
[1:17:48] lord in the physical corporal body
[1:17:50] in the seventh dimension
[1:17:53] we know we've seen the spiritual coming
[1:17:54] he's speaking here of the seventh
[1:17:56] dimension wait they're under the altar
[1:17:58] waiting to go in the sixth dimension
[1:17:59] waiting to go to the seventh
[1:18:02] waiting for the corporal body
[1:18:05] and the saints that were waiting for the
[1:18:07] coming of the lord notice they were not
[1:18:10] under the altar of sacrifice
[1:18:13] mine wasn't
[1:18:18] but
[1:18:19] speaking of the jews but these was
[1:18:22] speaking of the jews
[1:18:24] they were martyrs see
[1:18:27] mine wasn't under the martyr's altar
[1:18:31] now i want you to listen real
[1:18:33] close
[1:18:41] the praise of the lord the ones that the
[1:18:44] lord showed me
[1:18:46] the bride
[1:18:49] she was not under the martyr's block no
[1:18:53] the sacrifice altar of the martyrs but
[1:18:56] had received white robes
[1:18:59] by accepting the pardoning grace of the
[1:19:03] living word
[1:19:04] christ had given them a white robe you
[1:19:08] can sit down if you're able to
[1:19:12] the jews in the sixth dimension were
[1:19:15] given what
[1:19:17] white robes
[1:19:19] when
[1:19:23] when were they given white robes
[1:19:26] they did not come back to an earthly
[1:19:29] dimension to receive those white robes
[1:19:31] he says he gave them to them then
[1:19:34] but he says mine wasn't under that
[1:19:36] martyr's block mine had already received
[1:19:39] white robes by receiving praise god the
[1:19:42] living word for their day
[1:19:46] you tell me how secure your position is
[1:19:54] he says i have glorified him and i'll
[1:19:57] glorify him again
[1:20:01] if he did it at the first he has to do
[1:20:03] it at the second
[1:20:06] if he's glorified the bride once he will
[1:20:09] glorify the bride again he says mine
[1:20:11] were not under the martyr's block mine
[1:20:13] already had white robes they had already
[1:20:15] received the living word for their day
[1:20:18] so now we have the key
[1:20:20] to why those jews under the altar were
[1:20:23] given white robes
[1:20:26] while they were in the sixth dimension
[1:20:29] they received the revelation of jesus
[1:20:34] christ
[1:20:37] i'll prove it to you here in a second
[1:20:42] see how powerful the revelation of jesus
[1:20:45] christ is saints
[1:20:47] it surpasses dimensions
[1:20:53] i can't i'm not even going to try to
[1:20:54] preach on that i've got no way to
[1:20:56] understand that
[1:20:57] that's
[1:20:59] just astonishing
[1:21:01] they had already been martyred
[1:21:04] under the holocaust
[1:21:06] now these were not all the jews brothers
[1:21:08] says these were not all the jews he says
[1:21:09] these were the true jews
[1:21:12] the true in heart that kept the law just
[1:21:14] as much as they could keep it
[1:21:16] so it's not everybody that was martyred
[1:21:18] under the holocaust it was the elect
[1:21:20] jews the true jews
[1:21:23] but he said they kept everything they
[1:21:25] could and they were truthfully blinded
[1:21:27] and they couldn't see see christ because
[1:21:29] he's the one that blinded them
[1:21:31] but they go to the sixth dimension
[1:21:34] and they receive a white robe in the
[1:21:36] sixth dimension the same as we
[1:21:40] their robe that john saw
[1:21:44] is let me say it this way
[1:21:46] your robe that you have on now the white
[1:21:50] robe you have on now of the living word
[1:21:53] is just as real as those robes that they
[1:21:56] had on that john saw
[1:21:58] that's written in the scripture
[1:22:03] you tell me how real your representation
[1:22:06] is
[1:22:07] you tell me how powerful accepting the
[1:22:10] message of the hour is
[1:22:14] surpasses earthly thinking surpasses
[1:22:17] carnal thinking
[1:22:18] totally
[1:22:20] heavenly dimension
[1:22:21] even now we are seated with christ jesus
[1:22:24] in heavenly places
[1:22:26] not will be we are now
[1:22:31] praise god
[1:22:36] i do think rather by the opening of this
[1:22:38] this is the end of this quote i do think
[1:22:40] rather by the opening of this seal as i
[1:22:43] believe that it's open to us i did it
[1:22:45] with a good conscience with clear
[1:22:46] revelation before god not trying to just
[1:22:49] make it think because i always against
[1:22:51] organization never would belong to them
[1:22:52] but it's open to me now
[1:22:57] what did he just read right above that
[1:22:59] what did he just say right above that
[1:23:03] why would he make a comment the fifth
[1:23:04] seal is now open oh
[1:23:07] what did he just say right above that
[1:23:10] my group that received the living word
[1:23:13] is in the same position as those jews
[1:23:15] under the altar that received white
[1:23:16] robes
[1:23:20] heavenly representation
[1:23:22] by faith in a laboring
[1:23:25] grace
[1:23:29] paragraph 436 and i do think another
[1:23:31] thing by the opening of this fifth seal
[1:23:33] in this day straightens up a doctrine
[1:23:35] right here that i might speak of of soul
[1:23:37] sleeping now i realize that there's
[1:23:39] people in here that does believe that
[1:23:41] sea in the soul sleeping i think this
[1:23:43] disproves that
[1:23:45] they're not sleeping
[1:23:47] they are alive
[1:23:49] their bodies are sleeping
[1:23:52] but the soul
[1:23:54] not in the grave they're in the presence
[1:23:56] of god see
[1:23:58] under the altar
[1:24:02] you say oh okay now i can understand it
[1:24:04] because
[1:24:05] i'm kind of there but my body's here and
[1:24:08] when i die my bodies will go there
[1:24:09] brother brandon says i hugged these
[1:24:10] people
[1:24:12] i felt those people i spoke to those
[1:24:14] people you tell me how real that body is
[1:24:20] it's more real than the one you have
[1:24:22] right now
[1:24:25] it's imperative that we have faith in
[1:24:27] that
[1:24:31] because our intellects will not get us
[1:24:33] into that position
[1:24:36] we must have faith in what the prophet
[1:24:38] has told us we must have faith in the
[1:24:40] loosing of this seal we cannot allow it
[1:24:42] to be just some information about jews
[1:24:44] killed under the holy under the
[1:24:46] holocaust it's now under the altar
[1:24:48] we have to be a spiritual gentile people
[1:24:51] and let this seal be loose to us
[1:24:54] we have to have the courage to accept
[1:24:56] the challenge of the hour which is the
[1:24:58] message of the hour we have to get away
[1:25:01] from carnal traditional thinking of it's
[1:25:03] kind of like and it's maybe so no it is
[1:25:06] real
[1:25:09] it's more real than real
[1:25:13] and there's nothing you can do to change
[1:25:14] that
[1:25:16] there's no mistake there's no hybrid dna
[1:25:20] there's no family tree that can change
[1:25:22] that
[1:25:23] your faith in a perfect sacrifice in a
[1:25:27] perfect and don't leave that sacrifice
[1:25:29] two thousand years ago
[1:25:30] your faith in a perfect bleeding bloody
[1:25:33] word gives you a white robe
[1:25:36] now
[1:25:37] that is represented there in heaven
[1:25:41] it is true and it is real
[1:25:44] and we must have faith in that
[1:25:46] because carnal
[1:25:48] human intellectual faith will not change
[1:25:50] your atoms
[1:25:52] it will not happen
[1:25:54] we must have a
[1:25:56] have a faith that is only loose to us by
[1:25:59] the loosing of this seal
[1:26:00] he did not just loose this to us so that
[1:26:03] we could understand who the jews were
[1:26:04] under the altar he loosed it to us for
[1:26:07] rapturing faith
[1:26:10] we must accept that
[1:26:15] that's paragraph 4 36 he goes to
[1:26:17] paragraph 445 and he says notice the
[1:26:20] bible says if this earthly tabernacle of
[1:26:24] our dwelling be dissolved we have one
[1:26:26] all ready
[1:26:29] waiting
[1:26:32] you tell me how real already waiting is
[1:26:38] brother branham says it was just
[1:26:39] slightly above my bed
[1:26:41] i was there and i could look back and
[1:26:43] see the other
[1:26:45] but while he's there he talked to them
[1:26:47] he felt them
[1:26:50] his position was recognized he
[1:26:52] recognized them he even said some of
[1:26:54] them were ministers and i didn't
[1:26:56] recognize them at first because they had
[1:26:57] been turned back young but when i got
[1:27:00] when i got the revelation that they'd
[1:27:01] been turned back young i started to
[1:27:02] recognize them and some of them were the
[1:27:04] ministers that i knew
[1:27:06] i wonder if they were dead or alive
[1:27:09] i wonder if it matters
[1:27:14] it was real
[1:27:18] praise god
[1:27:22] i'm going to finish reading that quote
[1:27:24] notice the bible says if this earthly
[1:27:26] tabernacle of our dwelling be dissolved
[1:27:29] we have one already waiting direct quote
[1:27:33] emphatic statement that's where i seen
[1:27:37] those saints
[1:27:42] it is not optional
[1:27:45] to think it's a kind of like
[1:27:47] or a maybe so
[1:27:49] he said that is where i saw them
[1:27:55] he's vindicated
[1:27:58] he was laboring with the message
[1:28:03] thousands of his friends will leave him
[1:28:08] i'm going to have faith
[1:28:10] in his
[1:28:12] labor
[1:28:14] you say well what good does that do you
[1:28:20] it gets me a nice piece of clothing
[1:28:26] that's more real than this
[1:28:30] more real than this
[1:28:34] see i can tear this one
[1:28:37] i can ruin this one i can get spots in i
[1:28:39] can get wrinkles in it
[1:28:43] nothing that i have done or ever will do
[1:28:46] can change that garment
[1:28:48] amen that is his grace brother branham
[1:28:51] says we talk so much about mercy and
[1:28:53] grace he says they thought god's grace
[1:28:56] was like a parent and nothing would ever
[1:28:58] happen to their baby he says god's love
[1:29:01] and his grace to us is his election
[1:29:05] the fifth seal has everything to do with
[1:29:08] the election
[1:29:10] you cannot change election saints
[1:29:17] not even if you try
[1:29:20] you can't
[1:29:21] and i
[1:29:23] thankful is not even the word for that
[1:29:26] i can't put a word on that how can you
[1:29:28] put a word on god electing to love you
[1:29:32] and there's nothing you can do to change
[1:29:33] that it is unconditional
[1:29:36] the human mind i tell you if our human
[1:29:39] minds would ever really get a full
[1:29:40] comprehension of that we would blow this
[1:29:43] building apart
[1:29:45] that's why we have to have a body change
[1:29:47] saints because our body will not when we
[1:29:49] receive that revelation in its fullness
[1:29:51] we will not be able to handle it
[1:29:53] this hybrid condition cannot handle that
[1:29:55] revelation it has to change
[1:29:58] it has to
[1:30:02] and that's more real than we think of it
[1:30:04] saints
[1:30:07] you know as well as i do you sit in
[1:30:09] service after service after service and
[1:30:12] when the true inspired revealed word of
[1:30:14] god comes in its fullness to you and you
[1:30:17] accept it
[1:30:18] things start happening in your body
[1:30:21] you start sweating
[1:30:22] you start shaking
[1:30:26] your
[1:30:27] body cannot handle this revelation
[1:30:30] in this hybrid condition
[1:30:33] you tell me which is more real
[1:30:35] [Applause]
[1:30:39] it is so real and so powerful
[1:30:43] that for thousands of years of
[1:30:45] hybridization and carnality and sin
[1:30:49] that
[1:30:50] just a god have mercy a mortal man with
[1:30:54] faults and failures
[1:30:56] nothing good within him
[1:30:58] can pick up this spiritual principle a
[1:31:01] spiritual principle that fell off the
[1:31:03] tree of life and in his hybrid condition
[1:31:06] can give it to you in your hybrid
[1:31:07] condition and your atoms will start
[1:31:10] having a reaction
[1:31:13] and expressing itself in a physical way
[1:31:16] [Music]
[1:31:17] do not deny the reality of that that is
[1:31:21] the same reality that the evil one
[1:31:23] displays every day in walmart when they
[1:31:26] pierce themselves and tattoo themselves
[1:31:28] and cut themselves what is it it is that
[1:31:31] spirit in reality on their being
[1:31:33] bringing their body into subjection of
[1:31:35] that it has a physical effect on their
[1:31:38] body and there is nothing they can do to
[1:31:41] control it
[1:31:43] they can't help but cut themselves and
[1:31:45] pierce themselves and put ink on
[1:31:47] themselves
[1:31:48] they can't help it
[1:31:50] their body cannot help it you tell me
[1:31:53] which is more powerful that satanic
[1:31:55] false expression or the true expression
[1:31:57] of the word of the living god
[1:32:01] that same
[1:32:04] situation that we experience as the word
[1:32:07] is coming forth
[1:32:08] that is the same situation that we're
[1:32:10] going to be put in when our atoms change
[1:32:13] what is it it is stimulation by
[1:32:16] revelation it is oil and it is wine
[1:32:19] and it is real and it has a real effect
[1:32:23] even in a hybrid condition
[1:32:27] that's the truth
[1:32:30] praise lord i know you know that
[1:32:35] god have mercy on us
[1:32:37] paragraph 455
[1:32:39] now or to settle it
[1:32:42] those souls
[1:32:43] now watch this
[1:32:45] under the altar
[1:32:46] of the breaking of this seal
[1:32:49] that had been slain in the time between
[1:32:51] the death of christ and the going up of
[1:32:53] the church the eichman group and all
[1:32:55] that them true jews with their names on
[1:32:57] the book if you'll watch my brother
[1:33:00] according to the scripture
[1:33:02] they could talk
[1:33:04] cry out
[1:33:06] speak here and had all five senses
[1:33:12] not sleeping in the grave unconscious
[1:33:16] they were very much awake
[1:33:18] and could talk and speak and hear
[1:33:22] anything else
[1:33:26] why is that important
[1:33:27] because of the quote we've read just
[1:33:29] before that he says the same dimension
[1:33:31] these were in my people were in
[1:33:39] i'm going to read this quote and try not
[1:33:40] to have a screaming fit halfway through
[1:33:42] it
[1:33:44] this is all the way back in 1953.
[1:33:50] questions and answers on genesis
[1:33:52] and bef and god before the world was
[1:33:55] ever formed chose you and i in him
[1:33:57] before the world was ever formed now the
[1:33:59] first man now he made the first man in
[1:34:01] his image and we are returning back to
[1:34:03] that image that's right to our first
[1:34:05] created image
[1:34:06] when god created me william branham i
[1:34:09] was before the foundation of the world
[1:34:11] he made my being my spirit i wasn't
[1:34:14] conscious of anything as far as i know
[1:34:16] of but i was there
[1:34:21] oh i don't believe you're getting it
[1:34:24] you know why he said that it's because
[1:34:26] the walls of the building didn't blow
[1:34:28] out because if they would have got what
[1:34:29] he was really saying they would have
[1:34:30] blew the walls of the building out
[1:34:33] but now just a minute
[1:34:36] jesus told the disciples that he knew
[1:34:38] them before the foundation of the world
[1:34:40] and paul said here he chose us in him
[1:34:42] before the world began
[1:34:44] now there was some part of me
[1:34:48] ormond neville and the rest of you all
[1:34:51] here
[1:34:53] that's in christ jesus before the world
[1:34:56] ever begin and here's to my analysis of
[1:34:59] that
[1:35:00] i think that the people today that are
[1:35:03] possessed of this spirit or the spirit a
[1:35:07] part of these angelic beings spirits
[1:35:10] which rotated off of god that never fell
[1:35:13] in the beginning and resisted the
[1:35:15] devil's lie in heaven
[1:35:28] you say okay
[1:35:29] it was a part of me it was something
[1:35:32] that rotated off of god it's kind of
[1:35:33] like
[1:35:34] forget it saints
[1:35:36] just forget it
[1:35:40] there was some
[1:35:42] part of you and me that resisted the
[1:35:46] devil's lie in heaven and kicked him out
[1:35:48] [Applause]
[1:35:50] quit trying to put terminology on it or
[1:35:52] where i won't say quit trying to put
[1:35:54] terminology we should that revelation
[1:35:56] will come don't
[1:35:58] lose the principle just because our
[1:36:00] intellect cannot put terminology on it
[1:36:03] allow it to be true and allow it to be
[1:36:06] real
[1:36:07] this is all the way back in 1953 and his
[1:36:11] preaching never changed all the way to
[1:36:12] the fifth seal
[1:36:17] you say well we kind of did that we may
[1:36:20] maybe in a way okay
[1:36:24] i'm good with that because i'll say this
[1:36:27] whatever kind of that was or maybe it
[1:36:29] was or however it was it was real enough
[1:36:32] that it kicked the devil out of heaven
[1:36:39] you tell me how real that is
[1:36:44] and he didn't just kind of come out of
[1:36:45] heaven god himself said i see you
[1:36:48] falling like a star
[1:36:52] you tell me how real that was
[1:37:01] the scripture says
[1:37:07] jesus says
[1:37:08] those that i've justified
[1:37:10] i have also glorified
[1:37:13] that's right
[1:37:16] say well yeah
[1:37:17] he will
[1:37:19] he will he said those that i have
[1:37:21] justified i have already glorified
[1:37:29] when you can explain to me how that
[1:37:31] works i'll explain to you how this works
[1:37:39] should we be so worried about the
[1:37:41] mechanics that we leave the dynamics
[1:37:43] alone because we can't understand the
[1:37:45] mechanics and put it in a nice little
[1:37:47] box and explain it to somebody
[1:37:50] no
[1:37:51] we are a
[1:37:52] spiritual people
[1:37:54] who live on spiritual principles off of
[1:37:59] the tree of life
[1:38:00] whether i can explain that to you or
[1:38:03] somebody else or not
[1:38:06] it doesn't change the spiritual
[1:38:07] principle and the truth that lies
[1:38:09] therein
[1:38:11] allow it to be true saints
[1:38:14] be comfortable with saying
[1:38:17] there was some part of me there
[1:38:19] [Music]
[1:38:23] even if i don't have the terminal the
[1:38:25] revelation of the terminology to use in
[1:38:27] that there was some part of me there
[1:38:31] and if there was some part of me there
[1:38:34] that's in an eternal position
[1:38:37] so eventually some part of me has to go
[1:38:39] back there
[1:38:42] i worry about the terminology then if i
[1:38:44] need to
[1:38:46] i'm pretty sure i won't be concerned
[1:38:47] about it
[1:38:49] and i'm going to go one step farther i'm
[1:38:51] not so convinced that he won't give us
[1:38:52] that revelation shortly
[1:38:56] if we will allow the dynamics to be true
[1:38:59] why wouldn't he give us the mechanics
[1:39:02] see you tell me which which takes more
[1:39:04] faith
[1:39:07] a clearly mechanical approach to
[1:39:09] something that results in a dynamic
[1:39:11] or believing in the dynamics and having
[1:39:14] the mechanics follow
[1:39:16] which takes more faith
[1:39:20] what is the one thing the son of man is
[1:39:23] after
[1:39:27] why would he
[1:39:28] why would he not
[1:39:30] put us in a position
[1:39:32] to make us have faith
[1:39:35] and make it more difficult to have faith
[1:39:38] that's what he's after
[1:39:41] he wants to put us in a position that we
[1:39:44] have to have something revealed to us in
[1:39:46] our heart and speak it as true and
[1:39:48] believe it is true and allow him to
[1:39:51] manifest the mechanics later because
[1:39:54] we're a spiritual people not a natural
[1:39:57] people
[1:39:58] and he is after a spiritual bride
[1:40:02] praise the lord
[1:40:08] we've resisted the devil's lie praise
[1:40:11] god i'm only an hour and a half in
[1:40:16] praise the lord
[1:40:18] we've resisted the devil's lie in heaven
[1:40:24] do you know what that means
[1:40:28] brother branham said the same tale that
[1:40:31] he's telling now
[1:40:32] he didn't say it was elah he said it was
[1:40:35] lie
[1:40:37] he says the lie that he told the tale
[1:40:39] that he told
[1:40:41] he says the same lie that he told there
[1:40:44] is the same lie that he's telling now
[1:40:47] so if i was in a position that some part
[1:40:50] of me resisted the lie there
[1:40:56] what is the chances that i'm going to
[1:40:59] somehow not identify and resist the same
[1:41:02] lie now
[1:41:04] [Music]
[1:41:06] and i kicked him out there
[1:41:08] what are the chances i'm not going to
[1:41:10] kick him out here
[1:41:12] and what are the chances my mistakes and
[1:41:15] failures is going to disrupt that plan
[1:41:21] pretty slim i'm going to say
[1:41:26] one last question on that topic
[1:41:30] i love this quote like i could preach
[1:41:31] for days on this quote
[1:41:33] i love it
[1:41:36] if we resisted the devil's lie there in
[1:41:39] heaven and kicked satan out
[1:41:42] that sounds like a battle to me
[1:41:48] he said what happened in heaven spilled
[1:41:51] over and now takes place on earth in us
[1:41:56] so is this the first time
[1:41:58] or the second time you fought this
[1:42:00] battle
[1:42:05] revelation chapter 19
[1:42:07] he comes
[1:42:09] with his army
[1:42:13] you reckon that's a
[1:42:14] different army or
[1:42:17] maybe the same army
[1:42:19] you say well i'd like one more witness
[1:42:21] okay
[1:42:24] there was this man and he was looking at
[1:42:26] these pile of bones
[1:42:28] and he says can these live
[1:42:31] he says
[1:42:33] thou knowest
[1:42:37] prophesy
[1:42:40] that sounds like a familiar commandment
[1:42:43] sounds like maybe in my position in
[1:42:45] revelation 10 8 through 11
[1:42:49] prophesy and he says i began to prophesy
[1:42:52] and the bones came together
[1:42:56] but then
[1:42:57] some different skin from somewhere else
[1:42:59] from somebody else came on them
[1:43:02] and some different muscle from
[1:43:04] a different portion came
[1:43:06] oh no
[1:43:09] he said the bones came together and
[1:43:12] sinew formed on them and muscles formed
[1:43:14] on them and tissue formed on them and
[1:43:16] they stood and were a mighty marching
[1:43:19] army that was not a different army
[1:43:23] that was the same
[1:43:25] army that was laying there
[1:43:30] you say okay well so what
[1:43:32] so what
[1:43:35] get out of the chapter get out of the
[1:43:37] first four seals
[1:43:40] look how secure your position is saints
[1:43:44] he said you can go and be nothing more
[1:43:47] than a teaspoon of ashes
[1:43:49] and that will not hinder your position
[1:43:52] in christ those 16 elements will
[1:43:56] will be quickened
[1:43:58] those same 16 elements that went down
[1:44:01] will be quickened
[1:44:03] if they go down by way of the grave if
[1:44:05] we're not translated if we are
[1:44:06] translated it'll be those those same 16
[1:44:09] elements that make you up right now will
[1:44:11] be translated naughty different
[1:44:16] same ones
[1:44:19] that's how secure your position is in
[1:44:21] and that's why your body reacts the way
[1:44:23] that it reacts when the preaching is
[1:44:24] going forth
[1:44:28] the whole earth groaneth for the
[1:44:30] manifestations of the sons of god
[1:44:34] he's not just talking about planet earth
[1:44:36] saints
[1:44:38] what is
[1:44:39] your and my body made of
[1:44:44] we are a spiritual
[1:44:46] people that the spiritual principles off
[1:44:50] of the tree of life have a natural
[1:44:53] reaction and effect on our bodies
[1:45:02] continuing in the fifth seal
[1:45:05] he says now but there is determined yet
[1:45:07] to the people speaking of the jews
[1:45:08] another three and a half years
[1:45:11] well during this time
[1:45:13] he's speaking
[1:45:15] from the end of the church ages
[1:45:18] to the three and a half years to the
[1:45:20] jews beginning
[1:45:22] well during this time why see what
[1:45:24] happens is the gentile bride
[1:45:28] is selected in the seven church ages
[1:45:31] and goes up
[1:45:39] he's still in the fifth seal saints
[1:45:44] he's talking about a gentile bride and
[1:45:45] the church ages going up
[1:45:50] and when it does that way
[1:45:53] all these jews that's martyred along
[1:45:55] here there because of blindness
[1:45:58] laying under the altar
[1:46:01] god
[1:46:02] comes over and says
[1:46:05] you see what it was
[1:46:10] now i give each one of you a robe
[1:46:14] when did they receive a robe after they
[1:46:16] saw what it was
[1:46:18] what was it
[1:46:21] he just told you
[1:46:24] in between this time the gentile church
[1:46:27] goes up
[1:46:34] up where
[1:46:36] i want to see jesus you can't see him
[1:46:38] now he's a bit higher
[1:46:42] saints when we're translated we do not
[1:46:43] go to the sixth dimension
[1:46:46] we see him as he is
[1:46:49] what does that do to the sixth dimension
[1:46:54] i'm not just making this up he says it
[1:46:59] it's just common
[1:47:01] if the gentile church which he says i
[1:47:03] already seen them there where in the
[1:47:06] sixth dimension and he says now in this
[1:47:07] time period they go up
[1:47:09] what does that do to the sixth dimension
[1:47:15] why do you think the jews were crying
[1:47:19] how long lord how long is now the time
[1:47:24] you think they just woke up one morning
[1:47:26] well they don't sleep there so they
[1:47:27] couldn't woke up you think that they
[1:47:29] just had an idea let's ask them how long
[1:47:31] no saints
[1:47:33] they saw something what they saw was the
[1:47:36] the sixth dimension emptied out of the
[1:47:38] gentile bride
[1:47:40] and they said oh
[1:47:42] how long lord how long is now the time
[1:47:46] and he says
[1:47:48] you see what it was now
[1:47:52] yes
[1:47:53] i give you a robe
[1:47:55] what did they see saints
[1:48:00] there's only one way to get a robe and
[1:48:03] that is to recognize the true atonement
[1:48:06] the living word
[1:48:08] [Music]
[1:48:09] you tell me what the bride is
[1:48:12] the bride's position is so powerful that
[1:48:15] when the jews recognize the revelation
[1:48:17] that laid within them he gives them a
[1:48:20] robe of righteousness
[1:48:22] they did not see christ on a cross 2000
[1:48:26] years ago only
[1:48:27] the sixth dimension emptied out that's
[1:48:30] what caused them to ask the question
[1:48:32] and he come over and he says you see
[1:48:34] what it was now how did they see what it
[1:48:36] was because of his position in his bride
[1:48:40] you say that's far-fetched
[1:48:43] the scripture says he declares in heaven
[1:48:45] what he does before he declares it on
[1:48:47] earth then brother branham says this
[1:48:48] gentile men this gentile bride will take
[1:48:51] this same message and give it back to
[1:48:53] the jews
[1:48:56] he has to do it in heaven before he can
[1:48:57] do it in
[1:48:58] earth that's right
[1:49:04] allow it to be true saints you say i've
[1:49:06] never heard anything like that before
[1:49:08] neither have i
[1:49:10] praise the lord but you know what what i
[1:49:12] heard before has not changed my atoms
[1:49:15] so i'm going to keep looking for that
[1:49:16] city
[1:49:18] and i'm going to keep looking for that
[1:49:19] city and i'm going to keep probing and
[1:49:21] i'm going to keep looking
[1:49:24] and i'm not going to go out in left
[1:49:25] field i'm allowed to i'm going to allow
[1:49:26] it to be by revelation but when it's
[1:49:28] revelation i'm going to say it
[1:49:30] whether somebody said it before or not i
[1:49:32] don't care i know it's true it's in my
[1:49:34] heart
[1:49:35] that's why i say i know that if i could
[1:49:36] just say it the way it's in my heart it
[1:49:38] would be true and perfect because that's
[1:49:40] what revelation is
[1:49:43] you tell me if your heart tells you it's
[1:49:45] true or not
[1:49:49] allow your heart to tell you
[1:49:51] don't trust my words allow your heart to
[1:49:54] tell you
[1:49:55] and if your heart tells you that don't
[1:49:57] worry about the mechanics
[1:49:59] allow him to fill in the mechanics
[1:50:01] [Music]
[1:50:05] it's true saints
[1:50:07] the reason they were asking that
[1:50:08] question wasn't for a frivolous reason
[1:50:11] they saw something
[1:50:13] there was a reason they started asking
[1:50:15] that question
[1:50:16] why
[1:50:17] brother branham told us why he says
[1:50:19] because my people are in the same
[1:50:21] dimension as those people i've already
[1:50:23] saw them there
[1:50:26] and the gentile bride goes up
[1:50:28] and they ask
[1:50:30] is now the time lord is now the time oh
[1:50:33] you finally saw what it was
[1:50:45] that's powerful saints
[1:50:48] it's powerful
[1:50:50] see if we ever really catch a revelation
[1:50:53] of this
[1:50:54] the bobbed hair and the makeup and the
[1:50:56] shorts and the tv and the carnality just
[1:50:58] goes away
[1:51:00] look at the position he has gave us and
[1:51:03] look at what is hinging on it
[1:51:06] this is so much more than your trials
[1:51:09] and tribulations while you're alone by
[1:51:10] yourself
[1:51:14] look is what is look what is hinging on
[1:51:17] this
[1:51:19] the robes of the jews
[1:51:26] see if we can get off of earth
[1:51:28] out of carnality recognize our spiritual
[1:51:31] position the things of the world fade
[1:51:33] away
[1:51:34] and take care of themselves
[1:51:37] as i've said before there will come a
[1:51:38] day that we will not have to preach
[1:51:40] sanctification from the pulpit
[1:51:43] the bride is going to catch a revelation
[1:51:45] they do not need that
[1:51:48] and i'll say one more thing just because
[1:51:50] it's not preached from the pulpit
[1:51:52] doesn't mean you're still not going to
[1:51:53] be held accountable
[1:51:59] just because something's not still
[1:52:01] preached
[1:52:02] doesn't mean that god's overlooking it
[1:52:06] it just maybe he's done dealing with
[1:52:07] that
[1:52:09] and you best be moving on or you're
[1:52:10] going to end up on the pale horse
[1:52:16] you allow that to speak to your heart
[1:52:19] god is serious about this position the
[1:52:21] bride holds
[1:52:22] and he's going to make sure that we
[1:52:24] fulfill that position
[1:52:26] it's laid before the foundation of the
[1:52:28] world it's laid when christ was here at
[1:52:30] his first crucifixion it was laid when
[1:52:31] the prophet revealed the seals
[1:52:34] and then brother brown says he'll take
[1:52:35] that same thing
[1:52:37] that he revealed himself in before
[1:52:39] and reveal himself again
[1:52:44] do you think those thunder stopped
[1:52:48] whenever they sounded
[1:52:53] what is the thunders it's the voice of
[1:52:54] god
[1:52:55] where did he say the voice of god was
[1:53:02] look at our position saints
[1:53:04] look how secure it is
[1:53:06] what are the chances out of the billions
[1:53:08] of people that are on the face of the
[1:53:10] earth this morning that we are
[1:53:12] privileged
[1:53:14] to set and hear these things
[1:53:16] not because i'm speaking it god knows
[1:53:18] that i'm you understand what i'm saying
[1:53:22] i'm just saying what he said
[1:53:25] but i thank god for a revelation that
[1:53:27] i'm not a parrot
[1:53:29] and that i can speak by inspiration
[1:53:30] about what he said
[1:53:33] look at our position i've got to move on
[1:53:38] he says he comes over and he says you
[1:53:40] see what it was now i give each one of
[1:53:43] you a robe they said how long lord are
[1:53:45] we going in now
[1:53:48] why would they ask if they were going in
[1:53:50] now
[1:53:52] nuff said no no no no your fellow man
[1:53:56] the jews has got to suffer a little bit
[1:53:58] yet they got to be martyred like you was
[1:54:00] martyred the beast has got to get them
[1:54:02] when he breaks his covenant
[1:54:05] see gentiles as individuals jews are
[1:54:08] together
[1:54:10] even in that dimension
[1:54:14] it doesn't change even in that dimension
[1:54:16] this same word of god applies
[1:54:18] the jews are saved together
[1:54:20] feast of trumpets paragraph 253 notice
[1:54:23] speaking of the jews they'll know their
[1:54:25] messiah
[1:54:27] when they see him
[1:54:30] he is coming in power this time the one
[1:54:33] they looked for
[1:54:34] he is coming in power
[1:54:36] for the gentile bride
[1:54:39] and the jews are going to recognize him
[1:54:42] [Applause]
[1:54:45] that's funny
[1:54:46] it's kind of like what happened in the
[1:54:48] 6th dimension
[1:54:51] it's exactly like what happened in the
[1:54:54] sixth dimension
[1:54:56] you just keep walking in the light the
[1:54:59] mechanics will manifest that
[1:55:01] don't try to make it be something you
[1:55:03] just keep walking in the light
[1:55:05] it'll manifest itself
[1:55:08] and the jews are going to recognize him
[1:55:12] that must mean him
[1:55:14] hmm that's male
[1:55:16] hmm
[1:55:17] that's not what they saw in the 6th
[1:55:18] dimension
[1:55:20] or was it
[1:55:22] or was it
[1:55:25] thank god for a prophet
[1:55:28] she is
[1:55:29] him
[1:55:32] and then the bible says when they say
[1:55:35] where did you get those wounds
[1:55:38] he said
[1:55:39] in the house of my friends
[1:55:44] i wonder this is just me
[1:55:47] i wonder
[1:55:48] in the sixth dimension
[1:55:51] when the bride goes up and the jews see
[1:55:54] them go up
[1:55:55] and they recognize who they are and they
[1:55:56] have to because he comes over and says
[1:55:57] you see what it was now and they say yes
[1:55:59] and they were given rose
[1:56:03] i wonder if that gentile broad has scars
[1:56:07] and i wonder if they ask the same
[1:56:08] question
[1:56:12] and i wonder if the response is the same
[1:56:20] maybe that explains why i came and
[1:56:22] preached a message called indictment
[1:56:28] see the first crucifixion had scars
[1:56:31] there's no way to avoid scars at the
[1:56:33] second crucifixion
[1:56:35] you say oh brother brandon manifested
[1:56:37] that yep he sure did
[1:56:39] brother branham's not here anymore
[1:56:43] what's going to be slain now
[1:56:46] where the star where are the scars going
[1:56:47] to be implemented now
[1:56:49] you tell me who hurts you the most the
[1:56:52] stranger at walmart or your friends and
[1:56:53] your family
[1:56:55] the ones that's walked with you for
[1:56:56] years and then denounce the very essence
[1:56:58] of this message
[1:57:00] i wonder if those jews see some scars on
[1:57:02] that gentile bride
[1:57:04] i wonder if they say where did you get
[1:57:05] those
[1:57:06] let's say within the ranks of the
[1:57:08] message
[1:57:12] patterns laid saints we're not going to
[1:57:13] avoid it better get used to it
[1:57:17] who else can give you scars you tell me
[1:57:19] that
[1:57:21] the stranger at walmart is he may hurt
[1:57:23] your feelings you may be embarrassed
[1:57:24] he's not going to scar you you're going
[1:57:26] to forget about it in a couple weeks
[1:57:30] the house of your friends
[1:57:39] 65 trying to do god a service without it
[1:57:42] being god's will you see a tree
[1:57:43] struggling to live and that means
[1:57:44] there's a tree that don't die you see a
[1:57:46] man struggling for life it shows that
[1:57:48] there's a tabernacle waiting somewhere
[1:57:50] that don't die if this earthly
[1:57:51] tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[1:57:53] already waiting the good heavenly father
[1:57:55] permitted me to walk behind that curtain
[1:57:57] one day and see it
[1:58:01] this is in trying to do god a service
[1:58:03] without it being god's will why is he
[1:58:04] talking about the fifth seal
[1:58:07] you recognize that as the fifth seal
[1:58:11] praise the lord
[1:58:16] this isn't trying to do god a service
[1:58:18] without his will in 1965 at the end of
[1:58:20] his ministry
[1:58:21] and he's going back to this same
[1:58:23] translation
[1:58:26] when he talks about
[1:58:28] we already have one there prepared
[1:58:30] a body already prepared he goes back to
[1:58:32] the exact same thing do you think that's
[1:58:34] coincidence
[1:58:35] not a chance
[1:58:37] father permitted me to walk behind that
[1:58:39] curtain one day and see it how many
[1:58:40] heard looking past the curtain of time
[1:58:43] there it was
[1:58:45] just the same as i'm preaching to you
[1:58:47] all
[1:58:48] there they stood
[1:58:50] souls under the altar crying how long
[1:58:57] go back and look at that translation you
[1:58:59] will find nowhere in there their soul
[1:59:01] saying how long
[1:59:06] maybe he's trying to tie something
[1:59:07] together
[1:59:10] maybe let's get off of the earth into
[1:59:11] heaven and see it
[1:59:14] there's nowhere in the recount of that
[1:59:15] translation that there's anyone anybody
[1:59:17] saying how long lord how long
[1:59:19] but yet when he comes to the end of his
[1:59:21] ministry in 1965 trying to do god a
[1:59:23] service without it meaning god's will
[1:59:24] and he starts recounting this he says
[1:59:26] father father allowed me to see that and
[1:59:28] that's where they were those souls
[1:59:29] crying how long how long
[1:59:32] not just a myth
[1:59:34] somebody who had intelligence
[1:59:37] how long lord
[1:59:39] see
[1:59:40] they were real saints that's what he's
[1:59:42] trying to get us to see and they were
[1:59:44] there in that dimension 1965 god's only
[1:59:47] provided place of worship you who trust
[1:59:49] me to tell you the truth the dear lord
[1:59:51] jesus one morning about eight o'clock
[1:59:53] let me see that land
[1:59:55] now it wasn't a vision
[1:59:57] this is at the end of his ministry he's
[1:59:59] not mincing words now
[2:00:01] it wasn't a vision but i don't want to
[2:00:03] say that
[2:00:08] okay
[2:00:10] ever what it was it was just as real as
[2:00:13] i'm speaking to you here
[2:00:16] now i seen the faces of those people and
[2:00:18] i couldn't recognize them they had
[2:00:19] turned back young again and they were
[2:00:21] just real i'd hold their hands and
[2:00:23] things just as real
[2:00:27] i think he's trying to tell us something
[2:00:30] and it helped me because i used to have
[2:00:31] an idea when a person died just their
[2:00:33] soul went off but when but then when he
[2:00:36] quoted that to me
[2:00:39] that if this earthly tabernacle of our
[2:00:42] habitation
[2:00:44] be dissolved we have one already waiting
[2:00:47] that wasn't even a scripture the prophet
[2:00:49] put to it he said he quoted that to me
[2:00:54] you tell me how real that is
[2:00:59] see and we've got to have everything in
[2:01:02] threes to make a perfection see and
[2:01:03] there's one body here then there's that
[2:01:06] body there which is the celestial body
[2:01:08] and then the glorified body in the
[2:01:10] resurrection i'm not going to get into
[2:01:12] that i promised i wouldn't see that
[2:01:14] makes it complete
[2:01:16] see it's not a myth
[2:01:18] not an idea it's not a spirit
[2:01:22] it is man and woman
[2:01:25] like you are
[2:01:27] just exactly
[2:01:29] in heaven or this place wherever it was
[2:01:35] i don't know what to call it
[2:01:37] he referred to it there as souls under
[2:01:41] the altar
[2:01:43] [Music]
[2:01:44] so you just thought i was making that up
[2:01:45] the whole time
[2:01:47] the one that was speaking to brother
[2:01:49] branham brother branham says he referred
[2:01:52] to that place as souls under the altar
[2:01:56] and that's where me and you were at and
[2:01:58] that's where he saw us and he said it's
[2:02:00] real it's real and then he said it again
[2:02:02] it's real
[2:02:07] what's the spiritual principle under the
[2:02:08] fifth seal
[2:02:10] heavenly representation
[2:02:13] laboring grace
[2:02:18] while i could feel them
[2:02:20] i'm going to skip this one because we've
[2:02:22] already got that point
[2:02:25] and i looked at all the women
[2:02:27] looked like millions of them there and
[2:02:29] they all had long hair and white
[2:02:30] garments down and this one that was
[2:02:31] talking to me said don't you recognize
[2:02:33] her i said no said she was in her 90s
[2:02:36] when you led her to christ
[2:02:40] he starts singing
[2:02:42] amazing
[2:02:45] grace
[2:02:47] how sweet
[2:02:49] the sound
[2:02:53] what seal do you think he's talking
[2:02:54] about
[2:02:57] see
[2:02:58] just no way of ever explaining what it
[2:03:01] is
[2:03:02] just take my word if you believe me
[2:03:09] well i'm one of your people so i'll just
[2:03:12] believe
[2:03:16] be sure
[2:03:19] to burn every bridge of the world
[2:03:22] behind you
[2:03:28] 65 things that are to be i said well if
[2:03:30] i've passed over i want to see jesus
[2:03:33] i'm going to skip that one because we've
[2:03:34] laid that down he just makes reference
[2:03:36] again that even in 1960 i'll just read
[2:03:38] it well i've passed over i want to see
[2:03:40] jesus
[2:03:41] said you can't see him now
[2:03:44] this is the scripture said
[2:03:46] souls under the altar
[2:03:49] 1965 end of his ministry he goes back
[2:03:51] and says that fifth seal
[2:03:53] that translation that i had
[2:03:55] this is that scripture
[2:03:57] see there's there's no wiggle room now
[2:03:59] he gives a description he places it in
[2:04:00] the scripture
[2:04:02] souls under the altar
[2:04:04] he's just a little higher someday he
[2:04:06] will return we're going to go back to
[2:04:08] earth we don't eat or drink here
[2:04:12] 1965 it is the rising of the sun
[2:04:15] and one day
[2:04:18] you all know some of you know this quote
[2:04:20] i know you do
[2:04:21] you just contain yourself
[2:04:25] and one day when i was weary myself i
[2:04:27] said boy you'd better go ahead and do
[2:04:29] something you're 50 years old if you're
[2:04:30] going to do anything for the lord you
[2:04:32] better hurry up and do it you're getting
[2:04:33] old see and there that morning the
[2:04:35] quickening power come and he let me look
[2:04:37] over the curtain and i seen
[2:04:40] all of you over there
[2:04:47] no
[2:04:47] wonder everything in heaven and beneath
[2:04:50] the heavens and in earth and beneath the
[2:04:52] earth and in the scene everything heard
[2:04:53] john screaming
[2:04:54] [Music]
[2:04:57] if that doesn't do something for you
[2:04:59] i've got nothing else to offer
[2:05:03] zero
[2:05:04] let's get some collaring books and some
[2:05:06] coffee and talk about a man on a cross
[2:05:08] 2000 years ago
[2:05:11] if that doesn't do something to your
[2:05:13] soul
[2:05:16] i've got nothing else to offer you
[2:05:20] is at the end of his ministry he's just
[2:05:22] laid out the spiritual principle is what
[2:05:23] was underneath that fifth seal and he
[2:05:25] says that's where i went and i saw all
[2:05:27] of you over there
[2:05:28] saints he was not preaching to a bunch
[2:05:31] of dead people
[2:05:37] these were still alive
[2:05:39] during his earthly ministry and he said
[2:05:42] i've seen you all there
[2:05:50] praise the lord
[2:05:52] what else can you say
[2:05:54] thank you jesus
[2:05:56] what else can he say is it sure saints
[2:05:58] are you seeing it
[2:06:00] it's not intellectual i'm not making
[2:06:02] this up this is real it's in the
[2:06:04] scripture it's in the message it's so
[2:06:05] true and accurate that was jesus christ
[2:06:07] was here displaying it in his earthly
[2:06:09] ministry he had to act out each one of
[2:06:11] those and they had to be precise
[2:06:14] but yet we come
[2:06:16] and that low to see in spirit tries to
[2:06:18] creep over us and we start trying to
[2:06:20] make it a kind of like or a maybe
[2:06:23] no it is real
[2:06:26] and there's nothing you can do to
[2:06:28] change nothing i can do to change it and
[2:06:31] i say thank god i cannot mess this up
[2:06:34] [Applause]
[2:06:36] he said that second eve is not like the
[2:06:38] first she will not fall that's wonderful
[2:06:40] and it's glorious but look at why she
[2:06:42] won't fall
[2:06:43] he said because she's predestinated not
[2:06:45] to fall
[2:06:47] if we could mess this up we would mess
[2:06:49] it up but i thank god we can't mess it
[2:06:52] up
[2:06:54] that's the spiritual principle under the
[2:06:57] fifth seal
[2:06:58] don't ever look at it as jews under the
[2:07:00] altar again
[2:07:01] don't ever just look at it as jews under
[2:07:04] the altar again
[2:07:06] praise the lord
[2:07:10] oh my
[2:07:12] [Music]
[2:07:13] we're still in a time moment
[2:07:15] cursed would be time
[2:07:25] i'm going to stop
[2:07:27] i wanted to get into the second
[2:07:28] crucifixion of the bride
[2:07:31] but
[2:07:32] if i do we're it's just going to be
[2:07:34] really long
[2:07:35] let's
[2:07:36] musicians come
[2:07:38] let me read this and we'll close
[2:07:41] we'll get to the other some other time
[2:07:43] god willing
[2:07:45] i can give you the principle and the
[2:07:46] principle is what happened at the first
[2:07:48] crucifixion will happen at the second
[2:07:49] crucifixion
[2:07:51] and the reason they preached indictment
[2:07:53] is because there was a second
[2:07:54] crucifixion and that second crucifixion
[2:07:56] didn't end brother branham that second
[2:07:58] crucifixion is in me and you
[2:08:00] and that's why he would come and he
[2:08:01] would start quoting scriptures like she
[2:08:03] is smitten
[2:08:05] she is afflicted
[2:08:08] no you can't do that brother brandon the
[2:08:09] scripture says he was he was afflicted
[2:08:13] he wasn't stuttering and he wasn't
[2:08:15] making up words
[2:08:17] she's smitten
[2:08:19] smitten from the denominations
[2:08:21] don't leave that in the denomination a
[2:08:22] world put that in your own mind
[2:08:24] she is smitten from our own carnal
[2:08:26] thinking
[2:08:28] she is smitten from just thinking it was
[2:08:29] jews under the altar
[2:08:32] she is afflicted of god
[2:08:37] see remember what i told you before the
[2:08:39] fifth seal always comes into full
[2:08:41] manifestation after a crucifixion
[2:08:47] who do you think it is extending mercy
[2:08:49] and grace to this world right now
[2:08:53] and if this
[2:08:54] if this fifth seal
[2:08:56] if we're if we're displaying
[2:08:59] grace to this world laboring grace
[2:09:03] it's not just grace
[2:09:05] it's laboring grace
[2:09:08] see the book was oh lord have mercy the
[2:09:11] book was sweet in the mouth and bitter
[2:09:13] in the belly
[2:09:14] it was great
[2:09:16] what did the headstone cry when it came
[2:09:19] grace
[2:09:21] grace
[2:09:24] w i
[2:09:25] w i can't spell forgive me w
[2:09:28] h i t e
[2:09:32] s-t-o-n-e
[2:09:36] grace
[2:09:38] grace
[2:09:40] why isn't one grace good enough
[2:09:44] because under that fifth seal when the
[2:09:45] headstone came with this revelation
[2:09:48] there was grace extended to the jews and
[2:09:50] there was grace extended to the gentiles
[2:09:53] same
[2:09:54] headstone
[2:09:58] no different
[2:10:02] grace
[2:10:03] grace
[2:10:05] from a white stone
[2:10:09] if i be lifted up from the earth
[2:10:15] is he still drawing men to him
[2:10:20] then where is he being lifted up at
[2:10:23] because the only way to draw men is for
[2:10:24] him to be lifted up from the earth
[2:10:29] you say i want to win a soul to christ
[2:10:32] do you
[2:10:36] do you really
[2:10:38] because he says the only way to do that
[2:10:40] is if i be lifted up from the earth you
[2:10:43] see oh that's when he was glorified it
[2:10:44] was
[2:10:45] look at the definition that he put to
[2:10:46] glorification if a corn of wheat fall
[2:10:48] under the ground and die if a man
[2:10:50] forsake his life
[2:10:54] totally opposite than what we think
[2:10:58] but if we're in one position that
[2:11:01] automatically puts us in the other
[2:11:02] position
[2:11:06] out of your belly will flow living
[2:11:08] waters
[2:11:10] oh that's wonderful praise god
[2:11:11] hallelujah
[2:11:13] what do you have to do to get living
[2:11:14] waters to come out of your belly
[2:11:19] you have to have a spear
[2:11:22] thrust into your side
[2:11:24] right into your heart
[2:11:26] and allow water and blood to come out
[2:11:30] and that's real saints
[2:11:32] and that works
[2:11:34] how are each and every one of you
[2:11:36] sitting here how did you get here how
[2:11:38] did i get here
[2:11:41] it was
[2:11:42] faith in somebody else's laboring grace
[2:11:48] somebody labored and brought you this
[2:11:50] message you say oh it's just my dad you
[2:11:53] know he was racist
[2:11:55] no no no saints maybe it was but it just
[2:11:58] wasn't that there was a labor
[2:12:01] of grace that took place for you to hear
[2:12:03] these words
[2:12:06] the prophet
[2:12:07] labored
[2:12:09] to bring us this message and it didn't
[2:12:11] end there
[2:12:14] that laboring came forth in the people
[2:12:16] that were on earth at that time that
[2:12:18] believed that message they may not have
[2:12:20] understood everything but that's okay
[2:12:22] they believed what they could
[2:12:25] and they labored in that
[2:12:27] through grace and they gave it to the
[2:12:30] next generation
[2:12:32] and that next generation picked it up
[2:12:34] and they labored in grace
[2:12:36] clueless
[2:12:38] until this time
[2:12:40] that they were manifesting the
[2:12:41] revelation of the fifth seal
[2:12:45] but now we're privileged to look back
[2:12:47] and see it
[2:12:49] why
[2:12:51] that's the question
[2:12:52] why why is it important that we see it
[2:12:55] now
[2:13:00] i'll tell you why
[2:13:01] praise the lord i get i really wanted to
[2:13:03] preach on this but here's a good
[2:13:04] opportunity i'll tell you why
[2:13:07] because a month ago
[2:13:10] you can go to the news and find it
[2:13:11] yourself a month ago
[2:13:13] the first privately built spacecraft was
[2:13:17] sent into orbit
[2:13:20] with no public show because the
[2:13:21] coronavirus
[2:13:22] [Music]
[2:13:26] that's a coincidence
[2:13:30] is it
[2:13:31] it was a blip on the radar saints
[2:13:33] because there was the whole coven 19
[2:13:34] thing and then there was all the riots
[2:13:36] on the earth
[2:13:37] and just in the middle of all this
[2:13:39] spacex a private company not a
[2:13:42] government
[2:13:43] property a private
[2:13:47] a private
[2:13:50] show
[2:13:53] no public show they usually have tens of
[2:13:55] thousands of people with those launches
[2:13:58] not a one
[2:14:00] i won't say not a one there may have
[2:14:01] been
[2:14:02] a few there but it wasn't
[2:14:04] like it used to be it wasn't like it
[2:14:06] usually is there was no big public show
[2:14:12] i'm not going to make any more out of
[2:14:13] that than what it is i'm just going to
[2:14:15] that's what the news said
[2:14:16] i'm just saying what the news said you
[2:14:18] if you make it something else that's
[2:14:19] your fault
[2:14:20] i mean if you think that has to do with
[2:14:22] something in a little room that's your
[2:14:23] problem not mine
[2:14:26] praise the lord that's why it's
[2:14:29] imperative that now we catch this
[2:14:31] revelation that's under the fifth seal
[2:14:33] that's why it's imperative that we
[2:14:35] understand
[2:14:36] the grace that was released to us please
[2:14:40] start playing something or i'm going to
[2:14:42] preach all day
[2:14:43] that was released to us
[2:14:46] it is so imperative that we are secure
[2:14:49] in our position because our atoms are
[2:14:52] not going to change saints if we are not
[2:14:55] perfectly sure
[2:14:56] in our position
[2:14:58] we have to be
[2:14:59] and the only way that we will be
[2:15:01] perfectly secure in our position is if
[2:15:04] we recognize the spiritual principle
[2:15:06] under that fifth seal that was loose to
[2:15:07] us and that principle was grace
[2:15:10] grace
[2:15:12] heavenly representation
[2:15:15] demonstrated in laboring
[2:15:18] grace
[2:15:21] you allow your heart to tell you if it's
[2:15:23] true
[2:15:25] you allow your heart to tell you it's
[2:15:27] true
[2:15:27] [Music]
[2:15:30] i'll ask you this question
[2:15:32] have you ever received scars in the
[2:15:34] house of your friends
[2:15:38] were they real scars
[2:15:40] [Music]
[2:15:43] were they real scars or were they in
[2:15:44] your spirit
[2:15:48] see they're not going to
[2:15:50] thank god
[2:15:51] our lot is not the physical crucifixion
[2:15:55] we're a spiritual people
[2:15:58] so i just want to say that to bolster
[2:16:00] your faith saints if they're crucifying
[2:16:03] you on a spiritual level
[2:16:06] that must mean there's something there
[2:16:08] to crucify
[2:16:10] and by default
[2:16:13] by default
[2:16:16] that establishes your position
[2:16:20] so even if you can't bolster enough
[2:16:22] faith to say yes that's me i'm praise
[2:16:25] god i'm in that position
[2:16:27] allow the negative to bolster your faith
[2:16:31] allow the negative to bolster your faith
[2:16:33] because i know one thing the white horse
[2:16:35] rider didn't have no scars
[2:16:37] and the red horse didn't and the black
[2:16:39] horse didn't and the power horse didn't
[2:16:42] so i can't identify there
[2:16:44] but i come to the fifth ceiling
[2:16:47] and i'm not i'm not identified in the
[2:16:49] sixth seal just causing trials and
[2:16:51] tribulation everybody
[2:16:54] but i can identify somewhere in that
[2:16:55] fifth seal i am
[2:16:57] and i can identify what that means in
[2:16:59] regards to the seventh seal
[2:17:03] see it's by default if you can't bolster
[2:17:06] enough faith
[2:17:07] just to proclaim it
[2:17:09] do it by default
[2:17:11] because i'm pretty sure
[2:17:13] none of you want to walk out of here
[2:17:14] saying yep i am clearly in those first
[2:17:16] four
[2:17:18] i don't think any of you want to say
[2:17:20] that
[2:17:21] so by default just say the other
[2:17:24] and keep saying it and keep saying it
[2:17:26] until you believe it
[2:17:29] or
[2:17:31] we can just say
[2:17:33] i'm one of his people
[2:17:35] i'm just going to take his word for it
[2:17:38] i'm just going to believe what he
[2:17:41] has said
[2:17:42] about me
[2:17:44] and i'm going to believe
[2:17:46] what was loosed
[2:17:48] to me
[2:17:50] praise the lord
[2:17:52] a lot more can be said
[2:17:54] i want to stop there because i don't
[2:17:55] want you to walk out of here
[2:17:57] confused about the point that i was
[2:17:59] trying to make
[2:18:00] do you get the point i was trying to
[2:18:02] make
[2:18:03] do you understand your position
[2:18:05] do you have faith in that position
[2:18:09] against all odds
[2:18:11] have faith in your position
[2:18:13] because that position
[2:18:15] has a heavenly representation
[2:18:18] and it doesn't matter how much or what
[2:18:21] you do to change that you can not
[2:18:26] it's already there before the foundation
[2:18:28] of the world it was demonstrated when
[2:18:31] christ was here on earth in his corporal
[2:18:32] body and it's demonstrated again as this
[2:18:35] message came forth
[2:18:37] confirmed
[2:18:39] multiple times
[2:18:41] let's not go away doubting as brother
[2:18:44] branham said it would be a sin
[2:18:47] for us not to believe at this point
[2:18:49] let's not be sinful as we stand together
[2:18:52] let's be believers
[2:18:55] let's be believers let's just allow it
[2:18:57] to be true
[2:18:59] i had you stand up so that means i get
[2:19:01] to preach for a while longer right
[2:19:04] just couldn't
[2:19:05] i thank you for your time i thank you
[2:19:06] for your patience
[2:19:08] i believe you've caught the point that's
[2:19:10] to be made
[2:19:12] and i don't say that of myself
[2:19:14] it's imperative that we understand this
[2:19:16] saints
[2:19:18] brother branham says the book was tied
[2:19:20] together from genesis to revelation by
[2:19:22] those seven seals and those seven seals
[2:19:24] were the end of time message
[2:19:27] those seven seals were to us
[2:19:29] don't leave the fifth one to the jews
[2:19:33] understand why that fifth seal
[2:19:35] applies to us praise the lord
[2:19:37] god bless you brother please sing sing
[2:19:39] the original life
[2:19:41] god's attributes were manifested to his
[2:19:45] bride in this last age we have caught
[2:19:48] the revelation by the last prophet's
[2:19:52] message
[2:19:53] and we know who we are and what we're
[2:19:56] raised up for praise the lord
[2:20:02] [Applause]
[2:20:26] today it's what the scriptures
[2:20:30] [Applause]
[2:20:39] inspired by our god
[2:20:55] the son of man is
[2:21:04] [Applause]
[2:21:19] and we have responded to our god
[2:21:25] [Applause]
[2:21:58] is
[2:22:08] praise god
[2:22:10] praise the lord
[2:22:12] amen
[2:22:13] is your position secure
[2:22:16] you know when brother branham there at
[2:22:17] the end of his ministry he looked out
[2:22:18] that crowd of people
[2:22:20] and he said and i saw all of you over
[2:22:22] there
[2:22:24] do you know there would be people in
[2:22:26] that crowd who would disbelieve
[2:22:29] right
[2:22:30] was he saying every individual in that
[2:22:33] building was guaranteed to be in the
[2:22:35] fifth dimension under grace
[2:22:37] i don't believe that's what he was
[2:22:38] saying
[2:22:40] who was his audience and who was he
[2:22:42] preaching to
[2:22:44] he was preaching to the bride
[2:22:47] and if there happened to be somebody in
[2:22:48] that building who wasn't part of the
[2:22:50] bride that's not who he was addressing
[2:22:53] [Music]
[2:22:56] after the opening of the seals brother
[2:22:58] venom quit amen trying to preach two
[2:23:00] different messages and evangelistic to
[2:23:02] this way when he come back home just
[2:23:04] preached something a little deeper he
[2:23:05] finally got to the point where he was
[2:23:06] just preaching the seventh seal mystery
[2:23:08] just preaching bride food wherever he
[2:23:10] went and he was preaching bright fruit
[2:23:12] and the bride would catch it the sheep
[2:23:13] would catch it and he'd go over the
[2:23:15] heads of everybody else and he got to
[2:23:16] the point he didn't care anymore and he
[2:23:18] can come and make a statement like that
[2:23:19] and i've seen all of you over there
[2:23:24] who is he talking to
[2:23:25] the bride
[2:23:27] so when i listen to the tape and he says
[2:23:29] i've seen all of you over there who's
[2:23:31] his audience
[2:23:33] he saw me over there i believe with all
[2:23:36] my heart he saw me over there amen
[2:23:38] what's the mechanics of it like brother
[2:23:40] ben said i'm not going to try to explain
[2:23:42] it but i just believe it that there's a
[2:23:44] representation over there of something
[2:23:47] that represents me in the heavenly
[2:23:49] dimension
[2:23:51] it's before
[2:23:53] in god
[2:23:55] part of god
[2:23:56] returning back to god
[2:23:59] we can use all kinds of english words to
[2:24:01] mess it up
[2:24:03] we can try to explain it till we explain
[2:24:05] it away
[2:24:07] we can try to categorize it and put it
[2:24:09] in timelines but this is an eternal
[2:24:10] revelation forget the timelines first
[2:24:13] it'll be like this and then it'll be
[2:24:14] like that it's always been in the mind
[2:24:17] of god the same thing god his attributes
[2:24:20] his family
[2:24:21] [Music]
[2:24:23] do you believe you're part of that amen
[2:24:26] then you have representation in heaven
[2:24:28] then you're sealed then you're under the
[2:24:30] fifth seal and the loosing of the fifth
[2:24:32] seal brought a revelation
[2:24:35] of your eternal position
[2:24:38] and now i'm secure
[2:24:40] if i get sick it doesn't change that
[2:24:43] if i lose everything it doesn't change
[2:24:46] that and my family falls apart it
[2:24:48] doesn't change that if my church falls
[2:24:50] apart it doesn't change that nothing's
[2:24:52] going to change that
[2:24:55] that's a revelation that we needed
[2:24:58] under the seals
[2:25:00] so that we can move with confidence the
[2:25:02] way god wants us to move brother man
[2:25:04] what did he say he he's trying to take
[2:25:07] the scare away
[2:25:09] all this fear and scare that the
[2:25:12] denominational ages created all this
[2:25:14] fear and scare you better get it right
[2:25:16] or you'll be lost if you make a mistake
[2:25:17] and be lost you better come to the
[2:25:18] church you'll be lost you better listen
[2:25:20] to the preacher you'll be lost
[2:25:22] what's the seals trying to do what's the
[2:25:24] revelation they are trying to do take
[2:25:25] all the scare away amen there's nothing
[2:25:28] for me to be scared of there's nothing
[2:25:30] to be afraid of amen my position is
[2:25:32] secure in him amen i've come from him i
[2:25:35] go back to him whatever he is i am
[2:25:40] amen
[2:25:42] she is him
[2:25:45] praise god
[2:25:48] how much how much of you the flesh
[2:25:50] i don't care how much one spec's enough
[2:25:52] for me
[2:25:53] one dot one drop one how do you measure
[2:25:56] it how do you put it in the portion how
[2:25:58] do you divide it up i don't know how to
[2:26:00] divide up i don't know how to separate
[2:26:02] it i'm not interested in separating it
[2:26:04] three parts one part i'm part of him
[2:26:07] that's enough for me
[2:26:10] amen however he wants to manifest it in
[2:26:12] whatever way and through whatever terms
[2:26:14] it doesn't matter i'm part of him period
[2:26:17] i'm secure i'll go back to him
[2:26:21] i love him
[2:26:23] do you love him
[2:26:24] man let's just bow our heads and pray
[2:26:27] dear lord jesus we thank you god
[2:26:30] for the revelation that you gave us
[2:26:33] lord when you when you sent that prophet
[2:26:36] to us according to your word
[2:26:38] that was you lord
[2:26:40] we can look and see a man but that's
[2:26:42] just the vessel you chose it was you
[2:26:45] who was losing the seals
[2:26:47] it was you who was bringing the
[2:26:49] revelation to us
[2:26:51] and god now it's not us it's not the man
[2:26:54] behind the pulpit or the people in the
[2:26:55] seat it's not the clay it's you on the
[2:26:58] inside lord
[2:27:00] it's not us that's persecuted as a human
[2:27:03] being they love us people like us
[2:27:06] it's not the flesh it's not us it's it's
[2:27:09] the word
[2:27:11] that is inside of us
[2:27:13] lord we're not rejected you're rejected
[2:27:17] and because we're identified with you it
[2:27:20] just passes right on
[2:27:22] we feel it because you're abiding within
[2:27:25] it's your presence with your bride
[2:27:29] god and
[2:27:30] it's not the mistakes
[2:27:32] it's not the wrong thoughts it's not the
[2:27:35] ill-tempered words
[2:27:37] that's not what it's all about it's
[2:27:39] about that life on the inside
[2:27:42] god give us
[2:27:43] more lord more understanding of your
[2:27:45] grace so that we can quit looking to the
[2:27:47] outside and look to the inside
[2:27:50] for the revelation of this truth it will
[2:27:52] solve all problems
[2:27:55] lift us up in a higher plane as your
[2:27:57] people lord give us a different eyesight
[2:27:59] than natural eyesight a different
[2:28:01] understanding than natural understanding
[2:28:03] that we might see the reality of these
[2:28:05] things and we might perceive the real
[2:28:07] truth of this reality lord and may it
[2:28:10] change our walk may it change our talk
[2:28:12] may it change our everyday actions lord
[2:28:15] not change lord by force not changed by
[2:28:17] governments not changed by rules lord
[2:28:19] but changed by revelation
[2:28:22] may you have preeminence by revelation
[2:28:25] god may you have your position your
[2:28:27] place because you've come and revealed
[2:28:28] to us so that you so that we can yield
[2:28:31] to you and that you can have your way
[2:28:33] forgive us lord for our blindness lord
[2:28:36] but now as you shine the light lord let
[2:28:39] us come to the light and walk in the
[2:28:41] light
[2:28:42] god we love you we ask you to take us
[2:28:44] from here to higher places to higher
[2:28:47] realms as we physically walk out of the
[2:28:49] building let us not leave the position
[2:28:51] you placed us in
[2:28:53] well let's not leave that heavenly realm
[2:28:55] no matter where we go or what we do let
[2:28:58] us never lord in our revelation leave
[2:29:00] our position
[2:29:02] let us walk on this earth as you would
[2:29:04] walk lord doing what you would have us
[2:29:06] to do
[2:29:07] we surrender to you lord we ask you to
[2:29:09] have preeminence
[2:29:11] bless our brother ben lord for his
[2:29:12] sacrifice and his labor
[2:29:15] god as we fed lord from what you've done
[2:29:17] through him we just pray that you
[2:29:19] restore to him strength and energy lord
[2:29:21] and revelation and blessing
[2:29:23] for god we desire
[2:29:25] to walk a walk of faith by revelation
[2:29:29] not not just mechanical what we can see
[2:29:32] and feel and touch
[2:29:33] but what we can receive by faith let
[2:29:36] that be the greater reality lord
[2:29:39] god take us
[2:29:40] use us mold us and make us lord what
[2:29:43] you've always predestined for us to be
[2:29:46] help us lord to get with the program so
[2:29:48] your program can continue to move
[2:29:50] forward more quickly
[2:29:52] we love you god and ask for your
[2:29:54] blessings over all said and done
[2:29:56] in jesus christ's name we pray
[2:29:59] amen
[2:30:01] god bless you saints i tell you i've
[2:30:03] been praying a prayer for me personally
[2:30:06] that prayer is that god will let me
[2:30:07] preach by revelation
[2:30:10] and it
[2:30:11] it's risky
[2:30:13] seemingly it's seemingly risky to the
[2:30:16] human mind because if you're going to
[2:30:18] preach by revelation you're going to
[2:30:20] preach things that you can't always
[2:30:22] prove and you're going to preach things
[2:30:24] that you haven't always known and you're
[2:30:26] going to preach things that may not be
[2:30:28] easily understandable to the intellect
[2:30:30] but i want to get away from all of those
[2:30:32] things and i want to preach by
[2:30:34] revelation
[2:30:35] and god blessed our brother today to be
[2:30:37] able to preach by revelation amen
[2:30:40] because the denominations have been able
[2:30:41] to preach by intellect by schooling and
[2:30:44] by education but we want to do away with
[2:30:46] all of that and we want to preach and
[2:30:48] speak and testify by revelation
[2:30:52] because revelation is everything
[2:30:56] and then trust god amen to lead us by
[2:30:59] revelation it seems risky but it's the
[2:31:01] most solid foundation you can ever be on
[2:31:04] is beyond the solid foundation of
[2:31:06] revelation amen understanding is the
[2:31:08] tricky part
[2:31:10] understanding's the deceptive part this
[2:31:12] intellectual understanding that can all
[2:31:14] fade away and fall apart but revelation
[2:31:16] will last forever
[2:31:18] true revelation from god
[2:31:20] i said god let us be led let us preach
[2:31:23] let us speak let us testify let us read
[2:31:26] your word let us listen to tapes all by
[2:31:29] revelation
[2:31:31] let us forget all that we've ever known
[2:31:33] to know him
[2:31:34] praise be to god let's sing your songs
[2:31:40] oh i sing praises to your name
[2:31:46] o

[2:35:23] it says god came down in a cloud
[2:35:26] and declared the name of the lord
[2:35:30] what is the name of the lord it's not
[2:35:32] being able to spell jesus christ
[2:35:35] or just say it amen but his names
[2:35:38] denotes his person who he is and he is
[2:35:40] the person of the word amen and he came

[2:35:46] so that he can declare his name who he
[2:35:49] is and that's the opening of the seals
[2:35:51] that's the message of the hour that is
[2:35:52] the seventh seal he has come himself to
[2:35:55] declare his name
[2:35:57] and when we bring honor to his name it's
[2:35:59] not just the technical letters and the
[2:36:02] writing and the alphabet and being able
[2:36:04] to sound it out and pronounce it but he
[2:36:06] came in the cloud to declare his name
[2:36:10] oh praise be to god i want to worship
[2:36:13] that name and i want to praise that name
[2:36:15] and i want to declare and give honor to
[2:36:18] that name which represents him himself
