TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God tells him whatever you speak he see brother Bam tells us this is different than when Moses manifest that because when Moses manifested God said go speak flies and he went and repeated what God said but now God told him you speak and now brother Benham had to decide what he wanted to say and where he wanted the squirrels to come from and where they would be and what limb he would shoot them off of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God honored his words and created the squirrels and it happened exactly like that man said. Y &gt;&gt; why? Because that's what Adam lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus Christ came and manifest that he restored. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he didn't just restore it for himself. He restored it for the whole family. &gt;&gt; And that's what this prophet's life came to tell us that this has come for the whole family. Jesus was virgin born. Jesus was sinless. You and I were born wrong. We were born in sin, shaped in iniquity, come to the world speaking life, needed redemption, needed salvation, needed repentance, and are messing up all the time, every day. But he come back to show, listen, God didn't even bring a perfect man up and have that perfect man become the sign to the age. He brought a man out of poverty with limited education, couldn't pronounce all his own words, and would make a whole load of mistakes publicly and tell us about lying to a lawyer and getting his feelings hurt and having the blues and trying to run away from his ministry. Why? Because God doesn't need perfect people. He needs somebody that will obey his voice. He needs somebody he can correct. Somebody that'll stay in his hands. And when they get diverted, he can bring them back. And when they have a wrong thought, he can correct them. And when they lie, he can convict them. And they'll respond to it. God's showing us through that prophet that this is for you and I. It's not just for him. It's for us. What God's bringing back is what was lost in the Garden of Eden. And God wants to bring it back in the second fold of his three-fold purpose. and manifested in a bride upon the earth at the end time. And that manifestation will take us in a rapture &gt;&gt; because after that manifestation, it'll be time for the millennium. That's right.
