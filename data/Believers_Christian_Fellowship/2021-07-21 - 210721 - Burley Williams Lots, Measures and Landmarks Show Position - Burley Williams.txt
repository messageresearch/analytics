the band of holy angels came from the throne of god glory palms of victory i shall win it seems i hear the angels around the throne so grant they're shouting glad hosanna we've reached the promised land when we've reached that city our race on [Music] earth i saw the bride was climbing higher every day going up the mountain through god's provided way mantle has been taken surrender all and died

good to be in the house of the lord good to see everybody this evening we just like to get on into the word amen and uh that's what we come for to hear the words of life appreciate brother chad uh giving us opportunity to be here this evening it's good to have my wife with me and it's been a long time since we traveled bus that road pretty long we both about died with some woof this is just you know you're getting older amen but we are grateful to be here by the grace of the lord and see everyone's faces i would like to uh turn to genesis chapter 12 and uh we'll read the verse of scripture i asked for the chad how long he preached so he said sometimes an hour and a half whoa i don't feel so bad dear amen but uh we i was just studying some things yesterday i prayed that it'd be a blessing to you i just couldn't stop studying and uh i just kept on reading and reading more kept coming that's what it's gonna be a long service but we ain't going to drag you to death they say the word death is being drugged to death so we ain't going to drag you to death amen genesis chapter 12. i want to go to verse 5. so abram took sarah his wife lot his brother's son and all their sustenance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in haran and they went forth to go into the land of canon and into the land of canon they came and abraham passed abram passed through the land to the place of cycle and the plane of mora and the canaanite was there in the land and the lord appeared unto abram and said unto thy seed will i give this land and there bill he in an altar unto the lord who appeared unto him let us just pray father we just thank you for the reading of your word and we just asked and prayed that oh god you just come and speak to our hearts we ask these things father in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated i have a uh subject tonight you have to kind of listen to the way it's worded and by the help of the lord we'll just try to get to it the best that we can the title is it's lots measures landmarks shows position amen lots measures landmarks shows position we understand that about what we get ready to read in several scriptures that god gave the children to israel the land which is canaan and that land have to be divided in lots which although each one will have a section that's actually been predestinated to them and a lot is a section but you can't have a lot know what it is if it's not measured so you have to measure it and then a lot actually have landmarks to show its boundaries so you got landmarks to show you the boundaries and then by having landmarks it shows you the position amen just like in the natural we have uh somebody gonna sell a lot of land that say this lot is for sale but when you go out there and look at it there have landmarks they'll show you how far it is how wide it is and so forth and that had to be measured so you would know that are you with me so that's why it's lots measures landmarks and it shows position so we're just going to show the process that it takes for these things to be and we're actually very familiar with the message adoption and pretty much that's what we're ministering on is adoption because uh we know that there's each believer in the body of jesus christ has a position amen so we just want to talk about those things how that god in this scriptures and in the message laid these things out amen because i believe that we're in a crucial time amen and we probably share some things with you and uh i know you know my heart i just like preaching the gospel amen i don't get into the uh emotions i just like preaching the word amen because the word is the word and jesus said blessed is he that is not offended in me so we are blessed when we are not offended in the word can we say amen if you really look at that scripture when he said blessed is he that is not offended in me he was actually referring back to john baptist if you look we'll see what the prophet god said uh you remember when they when jesus explained when john saw his disciples there and asked him he's the one shall we look for another jesus went down the line you go show john this and you should go sean how the i did that they could see the deficit here and then he dropped it right in blessed is he that is not offended in me the prophet god said john was offended i mean think about it the devil come to his mind why are you in jail john for preaching for jesus christ has he came to see you john has he came to visit you you are in jail he's outside preaching but you in jail because you preach for him see that's how the mind can mess with you when you get in the flesh and you remember john's eyes his ego eyes had gotten dim let me say man i promise you when your ego eyes get dim you get offended on things that's exactly right so i pray that the lord would just help us it's going to take a moment but i i just want to go through the scriptures amen you know i want to read a quote it's in the message adoption and i like to first listen to what the prophet of god is saying he says here so ephesians here sets us like joshua positionally you notice joshua after crossing over the land and taking the land then he divided the land he from here manasseh here and this one here gad here benjamin here he divided the land and notice oh this just burns our heart each one of those hebrews mothers giving birth to those children she spoke the very place in her labor pains where they would be positioned in the promised land oh it's a great study and i promise you you'll have to go back to genesis when they give me when they conceive they gave the name of each one of the the patriarch you just had to look up their name look up their name what it means because many years in the message i say i i don't see him telling i don't see that you know i believe what he's saying but i don't position the place in them but when i began to look up their names and then not only in genesis when you go to deuteronomy and then when you go to chronicles it start talking about positioning so that's why you have to run scripture meet scripture to get the whole picture can you say man you know i'm so convinced of this message when brother branham say things and i don't understand it i always know keep the right attitude the answer will come and it could take years can we say man it could take years for god revealed because you got to remember god reveals when he wants to reveal and no one can give you revelation but god and you can't make him give you revelation he gives it when he wants to give it so ain't no need to get mad why i don't understand lord no the best thing to do lord would you reveal it to me and he'll do it in his time amen many things i'd be wanting to know quick and it don't happen like that sometimes god revealed quick sometimes he don't he just wait but it always come god is never late he's always on time but his own time is not your time can we say man sometimes you when he shows up you say wow i wish you would came a little quicker lord but no he was on time on his time not yours and you say wow how could he do that because he's god he can do whatever you want to do because he's god amen and we can't say there's no unfairness in him because it's not because paul picked that spirit up when he was talking about the potter can we say there's unfairness with the creator no the power can do whatever he wants to do with the clay is that right you know a lot of times people talk about they don't believe god they don't believe god you know what i'ma tell you right now there would be no unbeliever in hell there ain't going to be no atheist in here they're going to believe that there is a god so i want to believe him now i want to serve him now can we say amen praise the lord and this is what he says here each one of those hebrews mother giving birth to those children she spoke the very place in her labor pains where they would be positioned in the promised land oh it's a great study if we could only get in details which would take hours after hours someday when we get the church fixed i just like to come and take solid month or two just to stay right in it watch when they each of those mothers when they she called out ephraim when she was in labor police positionally placed him where his feet were setting in oil just exactly every one of them where they were at and joshua and i like this part he said and joshua not knowing this amen because joshua wasn't born you're talking about hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years later joshua wasn't born he said joshua's not knowing this but by inspiration led of the holy spirit after being into the promised land gave each man his promise exactly what the holy spirit promised through the birth back there can we say amen so it goes to joshua wasn't there but joshua under inspiration but we're going to find out in the scripture when joshua was giving them their inheritance it was actually more than joshua we'll finally see it in the scripture the priest had to be with him the urine thurman had to be there all of those things was involved with positioning are you with me and he says here how that god i want you to just really listen to this part how that god has sent some in the church through labor pains we're talking about positioning everybody wants one some try to make themselves fit in one some try to create some but he says here through labor pains we are being positioned people want position but they don't want that they don't want pain but according to what the prophet is saying here labor pains and he says right here oh they get tremendous sometimes when the church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world believing on the lord jesus that the promise of the holy ghost is just as real as to us as it was to pentecost how they groan cry under labor pains but when they are born and positionally born into the kingdom of god then the holy ghost has set in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers and some uh evangelists then he give into their speaking with tongues interpretation of tongue knowledge wisdom gift of healing all kinds of miracles we consider listen to the language that he's talking about there's all types of positions it's not just one it's all types he even talking about knowledge wisdom gifts all of these things are positions but god has to put them in their proper position you see pentecost had the gifts but they had no order so god had to send a prophet to this day to get the gifts and put them in order and he put the gifts in order by the word and we understand pentecost didn't want the word so they could not be positioned but god has a bride she's going to have her rightful place she's going to come to her rightful place and it's going to be done by the inspiration of the holy spirit and by the word but every individual is going to have to be obedient to the holy spirit because it ain't the position you want is what he has already ordained for it to be so we'll have to catch the mind of god and the prophet god said that's why each individual would need to pray to god so that god would show them his will for their life and many of us probably don't even do that we want the pastor to show us we want mama to show us we want daddy to show we want friends to show there's only one if it's god's kingdom he and he got positions put there he's the only one i can show you where it's supposed to be you see there's been too many problems down through the years even in the message ranked people want to position people where they think they should be can we say man i'll be hearing all sorts of things so i'm going to try to position the minister well disabilities have got a certain spot and dismiss the god all those things are true but god has to put him there and when god puts a person there it'll be publicly known nobody has to push themselves into nothing because god does it amen and he says right here now uh we understand what we read here in genesis 12 just follow along with me i read genesis 12 just for the simple fact to show where the promise was that the canaan was promised to them amen god gave the promise to abraham and told him thy seed is going to actually have this land belongs to them and we know the story all down through the book of genesis how things happen the children of israel wind up in egypt amen and they wind up in egypt pretty much for rejecting joseph they rejecting spiritual things the brother and rejecting joseph and so forth and uh every time you reject spiritual things it always going to put you in a worldly egypt condition can we say amen so but then i want to jump over here to exodus chapter three exodus chapter three and verse eight and he says i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good land and large into a land flowing with milk and honey into the place of the canaanites and the high tides and the amorites notice what he's saying i'ma bring them out of that land into a good land otherwise i'm gonna bring them out of egypt into the land that belongs to them which is canaan amen now we understand very well that israel the things that god did through israel he actually do it types you and me in the spiritual realm so he took them from a natural land to a natural land but he don't brought you and me out of a spiritual condition a bad spiritual condition and to the right spiritual condition so we need to keep the parallels how that what god did to israel he'd do the same thing to you and me amen so let's just keep going here for a moment he said now i want to go back into adoption two he says did you notice moses that great miracle performer that brought down israel down through the land brought them up to the promised land land but did not place their inheritance to them in other words moses could only take them so far and we know that joshua had to take them over he said he did not give them their inheritance he led them up to the land but joshua divided the land to the people now he's going to bring that parallel to what christ did he said is that right christ brought the church up to the place to where the possession was made to them was given to them just to jordan to cross but the holy spirit did you realize even jesus when he was even in a body of flesh he could not give us a position couldn't do it how could he do it in the body of flesh when it takes the holy spirit to give you your position he couldn't chop his piece body up in little bitty pieces and send it down to the agent and say here's a little paul a little no he couldn't do that he said but it's expedient to you that i leave because if i don't leave the comforter won't come and it's the holy spirit that puts us in play that's why jesus took them only so far he talked about positions and so forth but on the day of pentecost when the holy spirit come down it was the holy spirit now positioning the believers but we're going to have to understand about positioning in the book of acts that was the holy ghost reckoning the apostles and the believers there but you got to understand something even though the holy spirit was working in their lives there was no church order until paul came paul had to set the church in order so a prophet has a lot to do even with the adoption process that we go through we have to have a prophet to place these positions the way that they're supposed to be many don't agree with that that's fine but i'm just telling you what i believe amen and listen what he says he says christ brought the church up to the place to where their possession was made to them was given to them just the jordan to cross but the holy spirit is the one who sets the church in order the joshua of today puts the church in its order giving to each one gifts places positions and he is the voice of god speaking to the inner man that christ has saved the holy ghost notice now that goes to show you back and forth what i said is the holy spirit that positions you but god has an order and i believe every member of the bride of jesus christ is going to have their position know their place before we leave here i believe that praise the lord because god has allowed us to go down through the years a lot of mistakes misinterpretation misunderstandings he allowed those things to happen down through the years there's not one preacher that i don't know of don't have to have to go back and say church i was wrong that don't make the preacher small it makes him that he loves god he want to be right but you got some preachers won't admit they're wrong because of pride hello can we say amen there's i got some respect for brother branham a man in that office of a prophet visitation straight from the angel of god but is so humble enough to get up in the pulpit and say i was wrong not meaning to do that today because of pride you can ask my church i got no problem saying i'm wrong when i'm wrong i got no problem saying i'm right when i'm right either praise the lord it's that just the way that it goes amen but notice now let's just keep going down here the holy spirit is the one who sets the church in order that joshua of the day put the church in order giving each one gifts now i want to go over here to numbers 26 because we got to understand something brother says the children of israel they have been taught through their fathers that we're going to have a land flowing with milk and honey they knew that but getting to the land is one thing they knew that but they had to it had to be divinely revealed to them what their lot was we know we're the bride of christ we believe we're the bride of christ but it hasn't been revealed to you what your life is your place is what your purpose is because there's power in position when you know your position it's a power there it's an authority there something you ain't got to push yourself into make yourself get into it automatically works because you're in your place can we say amen amen that's why uh uh people today in the christian world even the denominational world they talk about the things of god we listen to certain things they say we know they don't have a clue what they're saying because they have not recognized their day in this messenger we're not recognizing your day in this message you never can even know your place in the age that you're in so god has to set us see when it comes to adoption it goes a long way it places us in the age it places us in the land it places us in the family it places us as an individual and it also places you in the church praise the lord and uh don't worry i ain't gonna preach all of the night but it's just it's just a real uh a big area you know it really is amen but we i'm more interested in now uh uh to just bring some things up how the holy spirit works versus the way we think it's supposed to be amen now i want you to notice in numbers chapter 26 it said and we want to go to verse 52 it says and the lord speaker to moses saying of the deeds the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names now you remember when he's talking to moses they ain't got there yet they're they're on their way there so even according to the name the land is going to even be divided by names names have something to do with it and he says from here verse 2 i'm sorry verse 54 to many thou shalt give them more inheritance and to few thou shalt give the less inheritance to everyone shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him god is laying everything he let you know some gonna have a few land so i'm gonna have a lot of land it's gonna depend on the tribe what the needs are and how god wants them to be positioned because what we have to remember when the children of israel was put into their position in that land by them being in a rightful position they was able to benefit the other tribes being in your position is just not your personal benefit god put you in a position so it'll be a benefit to the body of jesus christ that's what the purpose is for that's why we ain't got our little private little thoughts our private little ministry our private little ways no we're called to be a blessing one to another can we say amen that's why you know he says to some big some little i look at that even in churches every church is not ordained to be big every church is not ordained to be small there's all different churches amen you got some small some big it don't matter it's still the bride of jesus christ and whatever god has positioned that ministry if god called that man to have a small church he will never have a large congregation if you call the man they have a large congregation it'll always grow and never be small god chooses those things he ordains those things can we say man because you know even amongst sometimes uh people say well i wish our church would be if god didn't dainty to be big it ain't gonna happen what your problem is you got your eyes looking at other places you need to be focused on what's going on in your assembly and see where you can be a blessing there can we say amen praise god now notice what he says here verse 55 notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot according to the names of the tribes of their fathers shall they inherit it so now god now it's a big land but it's lots within the land and notice what he's saying here it shall be divided by lot so we understand here uh we got you got to remember it's a big land and it's 12 tribes how it worked each what most what joshua would do they would take the father of the tribe and show them the lot amen then the father of the tribe will go down to the families and show them their portion in the lot and then the family the husband the father he makes sure he lets his children know where your lot is where your inheritance is he let that's how it comes down are you with me so no so it's 12 tribes and they all be separated in their own position just the same as the bride of jesus christ the bride is all around the world different churches different churches but we look that in the sight of god as one but each one of us has a how many of you know each church has an anointing each church has a spirit and i'm not talking about well we got good and bad spirits i might always just be honest but you but you're understanding what i'm saying but here's the problem i find around the message and you find the same thing even in is in israel you remember the prophet god would say ephraim can't take manasseh's corner he can't take manasseh's place he needs to stay in his place can we say man and i believe that it's the same thing we have to respect one another of what god has positioned us to be that's what brings unity but i find today many want to complain about this one this church and that church that that turns me off can we say amen it shouldn't be that way brother and sister we got to respect one another for what we are [Music] man i tell you if you really want the church position real nice get get families in the church position that helps the church right there when families know where their position who they are we'll get to that hopefully about 10 o'clock amen can we go on but i want you to notice verse 56 according to the light shall the possession death of be divided between many and few god is laying all of these things out they ain't even got there yet but when joshua comes and the inspiration strikes when it's time to start dividing these things he will not deviate from what moses said and it would not take away what god promised them in genesis it's going to all work together that goes to show you no man can do that only god the holy spirit can keep everything running in the proper channel that he's supposed to run in can we say praise the lord amen now i want to go to uh real quickly turn to deuteronomy chapter 19. so we must and we must understand the land was divided by a lot but we also understand a lot is defined by landmarks and landmarks are defined by measures and when they all these are combined together it marks a position praise the lord now i'm just reading from my definition i want to make because as you turn it there a lot is a measure a land was given to israel as a body as a nation it take 12 tribes to make the nation of israel when they went to possess the land it was broken down to a tribe family individual the same as we are the bribe there are many different churches that make the bride every church has a spirit every home has a spirit and every individual has a spirit but if we're all leaning on the holy spirit letting the holy spirit lead and guide us it'll all work together can we say amen now knowing your position is power and authority amen how was abraham able to take out five kingdoms to rescue lot amen because he knew his position is that right moses wiped out a whole nation because he knew his position but it took god to reveal to moses his position his drama talked about it amen the prophet god said his mama taught him but it took the anointing to strike moses so god can put him in action because moses was going by intellectual faith but when he went back to israel i mean to egypt he went back by revelation knowing is calling that he's supposed to deliver the people of god you know there's a lot of times you can know what to do but there's no anointing there to do it you best stay still can you say ma'am and people always want to give you advice what to do but i'm here to tell you one thing i learned about advice when it's anointed of god there'll be an agreement in your spirit because it'll be god speaking to that person talking to you how many of you know the story you remember the story jethro jethro he he he knew uh politics jethro knew uh maintenance jethro knew order jethro knew how to position on job jethro knew all of that because he was a king but then he come to moses and tell moses what you're doing is not good you're going to wear yourself out moses what you're doing is not good don't that sound real nice that sounds so good or the advice just throws giving moses he said put some over 100 some over 50. he said then you deal with the heavy matters that was good advice but you know it didn't work because if it were to work moses wouldn't have went back to god later on and saying it is hard i can't bear these people by myself moses had the same situation after jethro instructed him he had the same situation of pressure but this time moses went to god and god took the spirit off of moses and anointed the 70. jethro gave good advice but it was never an anointing put to it so when god called moses an anointing was put to it and then the prophet god said and moses didn't even get no weaker because now god is in it so people can give you advice but until an anointing strikes that's just good advice it take god to move us into the position that he needs us and one thing about it moses had to come himself his father father-in-law told him it wasn't good but moses got to a place i need help i can't do this by myself can we say man so god had to get you in places sometimes did you realize i need help people can give you advice all day long you still go in the same circle but when you get to a place i need help now god said all right now we let's anoint some things exactly right amen in deuteronomy chapter 19 uh verse 14 thou shalt not remove thy neighbor's landmark which they of all which they of all time has set in thy inheritance which thy inheritance in the land that the lord like god gives thee to possess it now i want you to notice when moses is talking about this they're not even in the land so he's talking about don't you move your neighbor's landmark that goes to show you later on down the road when they do get that land they're gonna be some problem with people moving landmarks she's all in prophecy right now that probably is going to be some problems and we find the same thing today that's what happening people want to take somebody else's landmark or move somebody else's landmark according what god said that is a curse to do that praise the lord amen let me just now you when you got your own house how many of you know where your landmarks are and if the neighbors start doing something you look out the window that's a little too close how do you know it's a little too close because you know your land market you can walk right outside so neighbor can we talk uh that's my landmark right there see i don't know how it is here in south carolina if you put a fence at your house you can't put it on your landmark you got to put it three feet away from the landmark can you say man you have to know your boundaries and if you don't know your boundaries people can just jump on your land and do whatever they want to do so you'll have to know where your landmark is if you look the word up landmark it also means the same word as a lot and it also means a lot to it can we say amen so god got landmark he said don't move your landmark with your father's notice what it says what your fathers have given amen other words what the father's going to establish he put the lamb out there don't let nobody take that from you you see the message of the hour is a landmark can we say man because we are under the teaching the hearts of the children is turned back to the teaching of the father that is a landmark the message is the landmark for somebody to say the message is wrong it's a curse to them because they're trying to move a landmark that god had established [Applause] all right i ain't preaching landmark yet but we're gonna get down let's turn to numbers 33. numbers 33 verse 50. and the lord speaking to moses in the plain of moab by jordan new jericho saying speak unto the children of israel say unto them when you are passed over jordan into the land of catan you know i like how positive god is saying it ain't that you might not make it no he said when you get there other word it's definitely going to happen can we say man when god says something i don't care how long it takes but it's definitely it's going to happen verse 52 then you shall drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures destroy all their motion images quite pluck down all their high places now listen now he said you got land you got an inheritance but you got things setting on it so that goes to show you even with our position god has to give it but there are sometimes things that are trying to get in the way they have to be removed because if they did not remove all these things god telling them to move he wants them to get out of the way so it won't be no influences if they leave up certain pictures it's influence it can influence the children of israel or a certain thing that's why you know sometimes people might get mad i'll be honest with you that's not a good thing you got children got all these sports heroes still hanging up in the house actually what they become is idols they will idolize that person that's why they got them hanging up there can we say amen now some song because there's so much going on now this i could have been asked a question lately but why you got a picture of the heart from the head of christ why do you have a picture of william branham there and blah blah blah i said friends i don't worship him i said if i had that picture the hoffman had to cry and a picture of brother branham if i'm doing like this now i'm worshiping that person to an idol i said this picture is something that i appreciate can we say praise the lord so many don't have the bell i had somebody kind of i got into it with them about this so amen i asked him a question i said so god don't want us to have no idea no god no no no no i said well answer this for me why did god tell them make a brazen serpent god told him to make a brazen serpent not only make it but look up to it i just really tell you an action is not to have these things i said friend you got to understand motive and objective and reasons can we say praise the lord because there are some teachings especially that come from catholicism people that don't come out of catholic churches they won't even have a picture of their family in their house not one well i just kind of be a little smart with him i said you don't want a picture on you hanging on the wall in your house no no no no that's why you got facebook did you put pictures up on facebook because there's a wall that you're posting on heaven's lord let me get back to this verse 53 you shall dispossess the happiness of the land and dwell therein for i have given you the land to possess it and you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance now i'm just reading all these scriptures they have substance to them but i'm going to jump for a moment here because i'm reading a lot and i'm i'm finna skip a lot because we can't there's no way i've just studied this a long time and it was real good to me but now let's get a little more slower now come with me to joshua 14. i want to go to joshua 14 and i want to go to verse 1. no excuse me go to numbers 34 first then we'll go to joshua 14. number 34 verse 16. i want you to listen and then lord speaking to moses saying these are the names of the men i want you to make sure you read what i'm reading verse 17 these are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you eliezer the priest and joshua the son of none now we know the land going to be divided but now we we we we we it's more than just joshua doing it but notice it put joshua and a priest are you with me why is the priest there because of the urine and family because when a lot is actually when joshua under inspiration gives a person the lot and the priest being there it's going to light up on the human thumb and that this is your place it's gonna light up in the word this belongs to you so in other words if somebody wants to come up and say i believe this is supposed to be the me this is my life and i want it now you got to preach there and the word is not lightened up they say brother you can want it all you want and you got good reasons for having it but the word ain't lining up what you're saying so you it can't be yours so that's why the same thing today when people want a position they want a lot they want this but if the word is not backing up what they're saying they're in the wrong spot the word have to be there are you with me let me just read now let's go to joshua 14. verse one these are the countries with the children of israel inherited in the land of canaan which eleazar the priest joshua the son of none and the heads of the fathers let me read that again verse one and these are the countries with the children of israel inherited in the land of canaan which elies are the priests and joshua the son of nun and the heads of the father of the tribes of the children in israel it for an inheritance to them see now notice it bringing the heads of the fathers in there too i'm reading that to go about to tell you what i said amen it comes from 12 tribes to the head of the tribe to the father of the tribe to the family down to the individual so otherwise in all of this positioning it involves every one of us in every aspect of life but it's going to take the holy spirit yeah we go through years of wiggling and moving ups and downs not mistakes and fall but it had to come to a time amen we get into position with the holy spirit and say i know my place [Music] we're not in the age 9 time being children it's time to press on can we say amen all right let's go a little bit further wow i'm trying my best ain't no way in the world i preach all this but i'll tell you what i'll do and i'll just get with individuals here let's deal with something here tell me the first chronicles chapter 5. speaking of positioning and placing placings i know you all studied the message it's just so amazing i'm just thankful how the lord never never we would have taught adoption a placing of a mama being a housewife without god sending a prophet to bring that even out we we won't think of stuff like that and that should be encouraging some mothers that are housewives because if god ordained that for you to be guess what ain't nothing else you gonna do you you try to do anything else you ain't gonna be comfortable you're gonna feel miserable you are cause it's easy even being a housewife you ain't careful the four walls of the house close in on you you be like man i i can't be i i need to get out i need to do something it's and we have sometimes sisters well i just got to be honest every woman is not a housewife it just don't work and i'm telling you this because of experiences i've been through i know incident sister had a problem a real bad problem but to begin to notice every time she got a job things went okay i'm not talking about her to want to do something wrong or something bad but it was something it was a release agent when she didn't have a job it released pressure because when pressure is in the house y'all all know this is true if there's anything you want a woman to break down on you when there's pressures in the house things are not being met finances are not being met that put pressure on the wife it puts pressure there but i'm so thankful we had a prophet in this day to balance it say if the man is a little rough for him if the wife want to go out and get a job to relieve that there's nothing wrong with that she took a profit to balance these things it's not barely will but for a woman to do that to go relieve it that don't mean you already got two brand new cars now she got a job go get a third one especially when the children are little so i come to the conclusion when i talk to people about these things i said brother it's your house you're gonna have to know you and your wife gonna have to know what to do in your house and if anything is out of cater causing problems in the house you need to fix it and just be honest can we say man because i am not the pastor going to tell you how to run your house i can only tell you what the prophet said it gives you some understanding of scripture but when it comes to the end of the day that man is the priest of his house but brother if you don't know your position in your own house blue is going to lead your family sister if you don't know the position of y'all how look what's going to happen in the family it's going to always be arguments confusion until you know your place all right y'all get a little tight on me now but that's okay cause when they get tight i preach harder amen these things are facts if i'm preaching something false that's different but this is my fault this is facts because something to tell you brother and sister what's going on all around this world we can get our focus on covet and all of these diseases and stuff going on but yet forget who we are in the position we're supposed to be in [Applause] that's exactly right but it's so beautiful how the body of christ supposed to work together i mean be honest brother sister i i see so many things special about south of disunification because of little petty things and disagreements and i see it in it and it and it saddens my heart it don't supposed to be that way is it going to take the squeeze to make us get unified you're probably going to talk about that too but let not let it take a squeeze to do it let's do it now [Applause] [Music] amen you have to recognize a person where god put that person what god is doing to that person respect it i'm gonna go right now through the scripture this is respected can we say amen i mean even my own self i might be critical about something down through the years but now i don't culture i don't come to your terms now by the grace of god make no difference who it is i want to see how like the prophet of god preached a massive discern in the spirit i want to see what is in that person's heart so i know how to understand them is that right the bible even tells us don't compare yourself among yourself sometimes we do that brother i see so much and it just hurts but i want to be a voice to let the bride of jesus christ know we're supposed to be in unity by the word and it's going to take the holy spirit in our lives we drop down our own personal feeling and let god have his way watch how beautiful this is a blocks of children of israel when you study them each one of them had different qualities each tribe had different qualities in life god put it that way one tribe i believe is it's a one tribe i find the scripture in the moment they were good at fishing two of them actually they were good by the sea you can't you can't outfish them but they didn't get that fish just for their tribe they got that fish for the whole nation of israel but all of the other 11 tribes had to recognize these are the brethren that brings in the fish [Applause] now if vanessa's going out there and fish he ain't gonna catch nothing cause god didn't annoy him to do it he's gonna catch nothing but that might be the one that can cook real good the one that catches the fish might can't cook so he can catch the fish give it to the one that can cook and everybody eat [Applause] but they have to recognize what their place is because it got to be one purpose we come together we fight together we fight for the right principles and the right purpose for one purpose is to glorify god give god the glory that's what the purpose is for first chronicles 5. and from there we're going to go to first chronicles 12. let's go to verse 5 18. the sons of reuben and the gadites have to travel with manasseh a valid man men able to bear buckler and sword and to shoot with both skillful in war with 40 and 40 703 score that went to war now i like how the lord allowed this to be written in scripture it shows you what their expertise is able to bear a buckler and a sword and shoot with the bow that was their specialty let's go to chapter 12. you know in first chronicles chapter 12 as we keep reading we're going to see something it's going to start naming all of the different tribes and all of their specialties but it's going to show you the reason why it's so that's what i like about the scripture it'll show the reason why it is so hold on one second let me flip let's go to verse one these are they first chronicles 12 1. these are they that came to david to ziklag where he yet kept himself closed because of saul the son of kish and they were among the mighty man helpers of war verse two they were armed with balls they could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones shooting owls out of a boat even some even of saul's brethren of benjamin now notice it's just talking about they come to david but we're going to find out in a moment why they come to david but it's pointing out what they could do first in other words their gift their lot their position of what they can do to contribute to who david cause we're gonna find out in this chapter it's the purpose is getting david on the throne david making david king is the purpose for all of this all right now let's skip down i'll tell you right now verse two again they were armed with bows it could use both the right hand and the left other word that's some dangerous man it made no different what hand they had that weapon in they're gonna equally use it on you can we say amen that's why we need to be them type of soldiers to be able to use the old testament and the new testament can we say man we got to be able to use both and bring everything that we get a punch to the devil amen i tell you what if you if you search history or archers they're not bowman's like you actually think if you search the history on the bowmans and archers they back in them times they were able if somebody shoot an arrow at them they was able to even snatch it and get the enemy out put it in their boy and shoot it back at them that's how good they were with archers do you research i did it you can look it up exactly right it was a man doing a documentary proving how it was so and he proved it was so he did it himself had people to shoot arrow he was just jump up and snatch them and they wouldn't like you and me would put one bow in your put one hour in your bow they'll have a couple of them and they didn't know how to use them that's skill i tell you to get a guy like that he's a hunter out in the woods animal got it bad he'll knock the whole family off you know hundreds a day you hoping to get one got him i would not want to fight a person like that but look at the position they have who made them like that god for what purpose to put david on the throne that's what the gift is for that's what the position is for let's go on down let's just talk about let's go to verse 29 and the children of benjamin the kindred of saul three thousand for here the two together greatest part of them that had kept the ward of the house of saul now their gift is keeping the ward otherwise staying at home they was happy you got some people never leave church but they're always in church just staying in church always at the door greet somebody there's nothing wrong with that so you can't be like i wish i could go out like some other brother did it god had called you to do it it ain't gonna happen but the people that are like that god anoints them they actually don't even have a problem going nowhere they just fit right in they be helpers they don't force themselves in it it just happens verse 30. and under children of eve from 20 000 800 mighty men of valor famous throughout the house of their fathers and of the hash tribe of manasseh 18 000 which expressed my name to come and make david king uh oh we're gonna keep reading more gifts but out of all of the gifts out of all of the position out of all of the expertise expertise that they have it's for one purpose to make david king that's why god got his bride he wants her to be in the position that he wants us to be so he can be glorified that the world will know jesus christ it's the same yesterday and forever he's a god of order he's a god of promises he takes care of everything and people need to be in order what impressed the queen of shiva out of all of solomon's gifts what impressed her is the order she's seen of his service and so forth order is impressive but it takes the holy spirit to keep us in order and put us in order notice verse and under children of issachar which men that had understanding of the times to know what israel ought to do the heads of them were 200 and all their brethren were at their commandment now that's interesting it's pineal it's a car they know the times amen understanding times and it says i all their brethren were at their commandment so you might know how to make weapons you might know how to use weapons but if you don't know the time in the season to do it you might be shooting the wrong person so it's a call over the tribe of the war they can let them know when to go in battle when not to go in battle freeze that is beautiful amen other words some of them got my buckler man i got my spear dude ready just go out there and fight it's a call be like it ain't time brother oh put it back up put it back up i'll let you know see that's the holy spirit tells you when to open your mouth when you shut your mouth but we want to do what we want to do say what we want to say make no difference who it hurt who it offends [Music] verse 33 zebelin such as with forced to battle expert experts in war instruments of war 50 000 which could keep rank they were not double hearted there goes another key they could keep rank and they was not double hearted that's what we have to keep ranked know our place know our position and not be double-minded [Applause] these things are very very important but we want to hear the seals i'm preaching them to you amen all right keeping that rank they were not of a double heart expert in war in other words we're going to fight for one purpose and one purpose only we ain't going to change teens can we say amen that's the way it's supposed to be for you me i think it's in the hebrew series the prophet of god said we don't mind fighting for the right principle so you got to have the right principle for when we have a fight and that principle is not i'm gonna get my steam off because they offended me and now i'm gonna let it off that ain't the right principle the principle should be for brain unity expose that which is wrong and then bring back unity bring can we say man this goes from every level friends down through the house it goes all the way verse 35 well it's been an hour now i tell you what and the children of ephraim 20 800 mighty man of valor famous throughout the house of their fathers i'm sorry let's go to verse 33 and i'm sorry verse 34. nathalie thousand captains with them with shields and spear 37 000 and the dynaits expert in war 20 and 8 000 and asher such us went forth to battle expert in war uh forty thousand and on the other side of jordan the rubinites gaddites and of the half trial of manasseh with all manner with all manner of instruments of war for battle 120 000. if you notice it's talking about this tribe they got all manner of instruments of war but then you got certain tribes got a certain expertise in a weapon but they all work together that's why every church got a different ministry you might got a church they stay anointed and preach faith all the time and that's their life amen you got a minister he can just preach faith it's a gift that god gave him that's his life then you might got a minister got all the instruments he can preach revelation he preached faith hey man he can just go up and down he got them all god made that man that way you can't change today but brandon was that man also he had all the instruments but you have to respect the ministry where it is at i hate it when i hear ministers call another minister shallow how in the world can somebody be shallow if that is a true gift from god and they are full of the holy ghost let them grow brother we all have to grow but in this time shouldn't be that way verse 38 all these men of war that could keep rain came with a perfect heart to hebron to make david king over all israel and the rest also israel were of one heart to make david king that's what's the purpose for god in our case for god to be glorified and what's so beautiful about first chronicles chapter 12. that's natural but it's the parallel first chronicles 12. let's deal with spiritual. god placed it so beautiful in the bible because in first chronicle notice let's turn to first chronicles 12. but notice all of these i keep saying this it's to make david king that's the purpose now let's go to first chronicles 12. well we was reading these brother positions and places that god gave them and they didn't have to push in if another scripture we won't get to at night i could show you where they made weapons they would have tried that's what they did made weapons but they couldn't use them but they knew how to make them they just make them because they know they're gonna somebody gonna be able to use them now what is the one that make them get out of here play i want to use it he gonna get out there in that battle and ain't gonna come back that's why he need to respect the other one amen i'm making this take it brother can we say man that's why everybody's not missionary but you might have funds to send someone in the field you are a part of that praise the lord everybody in ministry would not have the same faith to even go deal with witch doctors because you get out there playing with that you can get yourself in trouble you better know but there are some brothers it don't phase them at all of the faith that they have i'll respect that i'm not gonna get out there gonna chase and face a witch daughter and god and inspire me to do it i know what my faith level is i know i'm not going to do that oh i'll make a show but i'm letting them catch the spirit out that's right spirit gonna get on berlin that's right you don't play with stuff like that and then you got mothers same faith but the children can be sick she can get under and lay her hands on her and take care of the situation in her faith it's still faith but each one of us has a measure you have to respect the measure of the other because you can only go you can't go no father what god give it so don't never feel like well he prayed that person they start walking i can't do that don't you worry about that if god didn't inspire you to do it don't leave it alone just be thankful give god the glory the man can walk don't give it to the person oh he'll hear me today will the problem come you glorify the man not looking at the gift god put there now brother branham said earlier about birth pains labor pains to get into positions and he started talking about gifts so we go back to gifts also we what we read in the old testament natural gifts with the stars and weapons but all of these things in first corinthians 12 are also weapons that are used amen to defeat the enemy and glorify the kingdom of god it says now verse 4 first corinthians 12 4 now there are diversities of gifts but notice what it says but same spirit just like all them brother and different diversities of gifts but there was under the same anointing to make david king there are difference of administrations but the same lord there are diversities of operation but it's the same god which workers all in all positioning everything letting us know it's the one spirit that does it because when you try to do it yourself you're going to get out of order you're going to cause problems listen what he says verse 7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to prophet with all for to what is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge but the same spirit god said i'm the one doing the dividing you got some medicine can take an ariel in this message and they can preach it and you'll feel like you never studied it and you'll sit there even as a preacher man i couldn't preach that god didn't tell you you had to respect one another where they're at the prophet of god said the man got the ball protect him folks take it from him protect him see in my immature days especially when i was an evangelist growing when i hear a teacher i hear a teacher teach in my mind she hit that a little harder then a teacher can sit there and listen to an evangelist he need to break that down a little bit more make it plainer for the people then another this is too soft no you don't have the ball protect the one that got it stand behind him because that could push the holy spirit but today because in any way i think it should be it shouldn't be that's pride it's wrong respect every brother for what they are now i'm not talking about nonsense now i hope you know me better than that i'm not talking about nonsense it need to be dealt with something just straight up nonsense need to be dealt with by the word of god verse 8 for the one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another gifts of healing by the same spirit to another working a miracle to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another diver kinds of tongue to another the interpretation of tongue for all these worketh that one in itself same spirit divided lot to every man severally as the man wanted no as he will so work on the holy spirit today is just the work of feelings emotions oh i feel like i think we ain't gonna get nowhere like that even in in the family in the family home you just you just it's like i'm happy this ain't gonna happen i think i better quit but it's been an hour and it's pretty long that i've been gone pretty long my wife and my sign posing if i asked somebody how long have i been preaching now look at her she can tell me she won't do it in the service but when we get home now berlin she shocked me the other day sunday morning i preached to paul i'm done she said never quit it's what yeah that was quick she said and i know you had some more gas in that tank i didn't get offended not at all you know when a preacher you have to be a preacher to understand dude when your wife compliments you that's just the way that it goes but i better quit brothers because it's too much it really is but i tell you this is such a thought because you deal with church ages families it goes all the way down you can take a service on each section and they're going to be all lined up the same way and it's beautiful you cannot when god doesn't designed something to be especially the landmark because that shows where the position is at to remove that whoa to remove that i will read one more scripture if i can find it right quick go to proverbs 22. proverbs 22 28 to remove not the ancient landmark with thy fathers have set and what we've been reading in the book of joshua that's when the landmarks were set but back in genesis that's when it was god told abraham where it's going to be in canaan that's why naboth knew exactly where his land was he knew his land he knew and that's why he told them this is my inheritance from a father and you can't take this from me when they did it that's why they got cursed because they broke the scripture flip over to proverbs 23. verse 10 remove not the old landmark enter not into the fields of the fatherless what was happening back then when a father died he could know his land marks it but people were so wicked in the time of israel they might want a little more land for themselves so they want to slip over there and slide landmark over a little farther so they can have more room for their cattle doing it to the followers because the father's not there then they would do things like that they got in trouble for those things this is what it says for the redeemer is mighty he shall free their cause with thee amen this message is a landmark god has allotted for this day and the speaker gets it the redeemer i ain't got to go fight against nobody god's going to plead the cause he's going to take care of it because he allotted a word for each age why do you think the prophet god was saying jesus couldn't preach no a message moses couldn't preach jesus moses couldn't preach noah because that was there a lot and they had to stay in their lot for the word that day and you can't change it so he allotted but we're in the age he didn't just allotted the word he gave it all and people want to move that landmark i'm sorry there's one more let's see i really don't know when i get into the seals that's exactly where i'm going i just know brother i'm going it's been an hour and 40. 15 minutes i better quit god bless you but do you get the thought lot measure landmark defines the position they actually all work together what god had to do in this day how many of you ever been riding down the road and you see land clear it off then also you see a bunch of little pink buildings everywhere what is that it's separating lots but did you know it so much goes with that when they're developing that subdivision separating them a lot they got to record every bit of that into the city system they have to record it but they can't record it without a surveyor a server a job is very important but he has to be accurate on his measurements or he can be giving somebody else land away so what would a surveyor do not a new adjustment i mean a new development but an old development what would that surveil do what would he do he go to the courts and look in the records and he'll look at the records that he would be able to know go out there on that property and walk it and find that landmark but when he find that landmark he'll be able to to get a transit follow that thing down he can start marking it but he's going by old records that was already put there can we say amen see the preaching of the seven seals had to go all the way back to what was in the mind of god but god had to send a surveyor [Music] [Applause] to let us know what i'm spot so yeah but you know what's so beautiful in the new development sometimes people move quick and they will have their house and a bunch of bushes come around and like nobody's gonna move out there and they would decide ain't nobody moving there i could use a little extra room i'm gonna go ahead and put some stuff here put some stuff here make people do that but then all of a sudden they know that the land is being cleared off and they walk out what are you doing somebody's gonna move here they say um well you can't come here they say yeah that's where their land is no this is my land see they don't make claims but the record ain't going to show up that is there so what to do all he has to do is say look i ain't even going to argue with you i'll be back go back to the records get the plaque go out to that person see that little stick right there listen yeah so according to my transit and according to the record you moved it over four feet yes you did you moved it over i got the records could we say man see that's what god were doing through the prophet then let you know you got gifts you got that but the word want to move you back here you don't went too far that's what you're doing with the pentecostals can we say man positioning everything in the book of joshua jeremiah why when he bought that property they sealed everything up can we say amen put everything sealed it up so when they came out of babylon squatters don't get on their land but they got the evidence and they can prove this belongs to me can we say amen that's why god gave us the opening of the word so you'll know your boundaries you know what the devil don't supposed to be what the devil trying to be i don't give all of that to you but just think he just go back to the records of the court where he's been recorded and say you're out of place that's the only thing the prophet was doing letting him know because you got to remember the two full parts of his ministry he first had to go to the pentecostals he had to and they had to reject them that's why he said i i gotta go to the bride it's a bright age if i'm not born again i'm a liar to see it but i'm born again that brings me and ushered me into the bright edge some people said i don't really agree with that i said simple brother it's simple jesus said we're in this world but not of this world this is a legacy in age but we're not of this age it's simple [Applause] come on chad god bless you i'm going to stop i'll just stop but every one of us has a measure and we have to respect one another what god has done in their lives let's get the lord ahead god bless you god bless you god bless you son good to see everybody amen let's all stand i was eating good and i was enjoying it all amen i kept hoping he would keep going and we pulled a little extra i think amen praise the lord god is good amen god is good how many is thankful that there was a prophet in this day that told us this all belongs to you amen the squatter's been on it but it all belongs to you and every promise in the book is mine why because there's been a surveyor come out and says nope it was promised to you your name's on the book now you have an abstract title deed it's cleared all the way back amen god bless brother burley i wish we had a weekend of services so he could finish i wish we had three days in a row because i'd like to hear all of that i'd like to spend some time shouting amen and pulling every piece out that god put in there amen just pray for brother burley and god will continue to bless him and use him for him and his wife and his family and his church back home man it's been good to have him here it's been good to be reminded that we have a position we have a place we weren't just born haphazardly because two people decided to get married god knew you would be here he knew what channel you'd come through he knew when you would arrive here and he knew what your makeup would be and what your temperament would be and he saw to it to get you just the way you are just where you are in this end time because he already had a position for you and i and he's placing us in that bias word and i said god let me stay in my position and be all that you called me to be if you call me to fish i'll fish i like that one anyway if you call me the raised wheat raised sheep whatever my lot whatever my portion is let me do it with my whole heart to benefit all my brethren amen god bless you all i mean let's sing you have a song like well i one can't wait to be my way as i journey here below for there is no other highway that a child of god should go be steep and rough if he leads me it's enough i want god's way to be my way every day [Applause] there is no other highway that a child of god let's just bow our heads and thank god for this word dear lord jesus we thank you lord we thank you god that you kept your promise to us and you fed us from your word tonight we thank you god for the portion that you've shared with us through brother burnley lord god made these things go deep in our hearts may become a living reality in our life may each one of us lord come to that realization of who we are in christ the position that you want us in and may we give our full heart and life to it lord lord i pray that you would let it become a reality if there's any here who's struggling with what their position is lord i pray god that you would just bring a realization and a revelation to their heart that they can put their whole heart into it lord and they can be all that you called them to be in this day may we as a body of believers lord stay in our position and be what you've called us to be to shine the light the way you've called us to shine the light to be everything you've called us to be and lord not to not to try to be something else but to just relax in what you've called us to and be what you've called us to be lord we as a body ask that you would bless our brother burnley and his family this church lord back home that you would bless them that they would hold their position and
