[0:00] i am so glad
[0:06] that jesus has found me
[0:11] for he knows me
[0:19] surrounds me
[0:33] [Music]
[0:42] me
[0:44] praise god sister chris he's going to
[0:47] sing for us
[0:48] isaac was a type of christ
[0:52] through isaac come christ
[0:56] and then rebecca was the type
[0:59] of the church did you notice
[1:04] that the bride and ella easier
[1:09] found rebecca in the evening time
[1:14] the sign was performed in the evening
[1:17] time
[1:19] that's the time we're living in
[1:22] i trust that you get this
[1:26] it was in the evening time when rebecca
[1:29] came out
[1:30] led by the spirit
[1:34] do you believe that how otherwise would
[1:37] she have come there might have been many
[1:39] before
[1:40] but she was led by the spirit in the
[1:44] evening time
[1:48] and eliezer the messenger the minister
[1:52] the true servant to his master was led
[1:56] in the evening time
[2:00] and the true servant had left his creeds
[2:02] and things behind and it made up
[2:04] his mind that he was going to trust god
[2:08] in the evening time
[2:12] wonder why that rebecca came before any
[2:15] of the other girls
[2:16] did you know that rebecca and isaac was
[2:19] blood relation
[2:22] cousins and the bride of jesus christ
[2:28] is blood relation to him
[2:31] a blood bought bride
[2:34] no wonder she was led by the spirit
[2:37] there was a connection coming together
[2:40] there was a union coming together
[2:56] my days i was doing
[3:02] what i done so many
[3:05] times i heard
[3:09] of someone
[3:13] who lived
[3:19] i was asked if i
[3:22] would go and be
[3:26] his chosen bride
[3:30] i went with his servant
[3:36] it was in the evening
[3:39] time when i heard
[3:46] his servant cry
[3:50] [Music]
[3:52] behold your isaac
[3:56] this man i've brought you to
[4:02] behold there he stands
[4:07] my promise was true
[4:12] and now rebecca

[4:44] wonderful word of
[4:51] [Music]
[4:54] life
[4:56] a virtuous wife
[5:01] are you wearing the wedding band
[5:06] of a mere
[5:12] do you know you're isaac
[5:18] is he still preferred
[5:22] above all
[5:27] that you've observed
[5:35] the bible was written
[5:41] for his bride in the end time
[5:46] and now we can see
[5:53] [Music]
[5:58] [Music]
[6:02] it's an invisible
[6:08] this perfect love's revealed
[6:13] it comes from my origin
[6:18] this love will take me
[6:23] to my future home
[6:27] [Music]
[6:32] behold your isaac
[6:35] it's christ revealed to you
[6:41] in a cloud our lord came down

[17:11] good morning my brothers and my sisters
[17:14] is there really is the rising of the sun
[17:17] no it was and it will be but is the
[17:19] rising of the sun
[17:21] the veil is raining too and we can see
[17:24] who is here right now
[17:26] what a privilege that the quickening
[17:28] power allows us to
[17:29] to see him in this age god bless you
[17:32] this morning i
[17:33] greet you in the name of lord jesus
[17:34] christ this is truly
[17:36] again the privilege and joy for me to
[17:38] stand here
[17:40] knowing responsibility for every word
[17:42] but trusting him
[17:44] that he is here and takes under control
[17:46] me myself
[17:48] and you and he is present here to deal
[17:50] with our hearts
[17:52] and just say quicken again the word of
[17:54] god word of promise for our hearts
[17:56] and just change us yes because we are
[18:00] looking for the change
[18:01] we know that god promised as a change of
[18:04] the body
[18:05] but the change of the body is the result
[18:06] of many changes in our lives
[18:09] and anytime when the word of god comes
[18:11] and doesn't change
[18:12] us i'm sorry it went over the head
[18:16] but when it comes to your heart and
[18:18] changes you and me
[18:20] this is the purpose of the coming of the
[18:21] world because the world is a different
[18:23] concept than the
[18:24] concept around us so i i really
[18:28] i'm looking for him just to use me for
[18:31] his glory
[18:32] to use uh you for his glory because we
[18:35] are on the same boat
[18:37] we are just on the same boat so god
[18:40] bless you
[18:41] i really enjoyed the song and the song
[18:43] service and the atmosphere that is
[18:45] here i really uh depending on that
[18:48] because i know that
[18:49] all of us as a christians we are
[18:51] creators of the
[18:52] atmosphere if we can just uh
[18:56] create the right kind of atmosphere
[18:58] there is a really great possibility that
[19:00] god will
[19:01] do something for us so i appreciate this
[19:03] atmosphere here
[19:04] your expectation and the fellowship with
[19:06] your pastor
[19:07] his family and the brothers and sisters
[19:10] i met
[19:12] in the meantime it's really really great
[19:14] god bless you all of you
[19:17] i have a little a small testimony and an
[19:20] announcement
[19:22] since many many years we publish uh
[19:23] messages of bradley branham
[19:25] uh in polish language since almost 30
[19:28] years
[19:29] uh and about a year ago over a year ago
[19:32] the lord placed on our hearts to publish
[19:34] the messages in english language
[19:37] because as we travel we are aware of the
[19:40] shortage of these books and literature
[19:43] maybe not in the united states
[19:44] maybe not in europe but in the dozens
[19:48] and dozens of countries people they
[19:49] don't have
[19:50] books of the prophet to read and just to
[19:54] exercise their faith and to go into the
[19:56] mystery of god
[19:58] so the purpose of this little
[20:00] presentation
[20:02] in a few minutes is if you know some
[20:04] believers in the
[20:06] third world countries in asia or africa
[20:09] that is interested to get the books of
[20:12] the prophet
[20:13] um in english free of charge
[20:16] would be more than glad to send them we
[20:20] are sending the books to more than 20
[20:21] countries
[20:22] and we publish almost 80 000 books of
[20:26] the prophet last year
[20:27] and we've got a lot of books and we
[20:30] don't want to keep it in our storage
[20:32] we want to just send it to the people
[20:34] but we want to just send it to the right
[20:36] kind of people
[20:37] hungry and they will use it for the
[20:39] glory of god we've got the books like
[20:42] choosing of the bride praise god for the
[20:45] song
[20:46] this afternoon i really appreciate it
[20:50] and uh does god change his mind
[20:53] it's also available we can send it one
[20:56] in a million
[20:58] amen you are one in a million
[21:02] if you are a believer you must be one in
[21:04] a million and god doesn't change his
[21:06] mind about you
[21:08] the same way how he doesn't change his
[21:09] mind about his word
[21:11] amen because the choosing of the bride
[21:13] amen
[21:14] it was his choice and someone was beyond
[21:17] the curtain of time
[21:19] and describes the the you know the
[21:22] dimension eternal dimension and he
[21:25] he was there and he saw you and he came
[21:28] back he said i saw you there
[21:30] so so interesting so interesting beyond
[21:32] the curtain of time
[21:34] amen we're going to this place because
[21:37] we are coming from this place
[21:39] resume of the seven church ages is also
[21:41] available we can send it gladly
[21:44] this is a consummation of all ages
[21:46] resume of all ages
[21:48] we are coming we are leaving the seven
[21:50] and we are coming to eight
[21:51] amen present stage of my ministry why
[21:54] malachi for profit
[21:56] such a vindicated prophet as no one else
[21:58] before
[21:59] with a purifying cloud in the
[22:02] consummation of the ages
[22:03] he was rejected misunderstood why
[22:07] he explained that in the present stage
[22:09] of my ministry jesus was rejected
[22:12] at the end paul was rejected at the end
[22:14] and every true prophet
[22:16] malachi 4 was rejected amen you know
[22:19] that
[22:20] the voice of the sign people are looking
[22:22] for the signs
[22:23] they are looking for the signs but there
[22:25] is a voice behind
[22:26] every true sign this is the message
[22:29] that's what we believe
[22:30] we receive the message which is the
[22:32] result of the signs and wonders
[22:34] in the ministry of malachi 4. god sent
[22:37] us elijah prophet
[22:38] to turn our hearts back to the hearts of
[22:40] the fathers
[22:41] but there's a message behind the sign
[22:43] amen the voice
[22:45] of god the last days amen
[22:48] amen is still the voice of god sounds
[22:51] around the world
[22:52] it was the prophet now he's a bride
[22:54] because the voice of god is in the bride
[22:58] this is the voice of god the last age
[23:00] last days amen how we can know it we
[23:02] have to go into the world
[23:04] there's a revelation unveiling of god
[23:07] not unveiling of man not unveiling of
[23:10] prophet is unveiling of god
[23:12] through a prophet amen satan's eden
[23:15] this is really key to understand why
[23:18] there's such troubles around
[23:19] us why there's such a bad atmosphere
[23:22] it's a nice atmosphere in the church
[23:24] good atmosphere when you do study of
[23:26] your bible you listen the word
[23:28] but there is a sentence in around us we
[23:30] are right in the midst
[23:32] but we are a selected group of people we
[23:34] cannot be deceived there's no way
[23:36] for a bride to be deceived it's just
[23:38] impossible
[23:39] satan's eden and christ is the mystery
[23:43] of god revealed
[23:45] christ the mystery of god revealed amen
[23:49] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[23:51] and the bride she is the mystery of
[23:53] christ
[23:54] revealed amen so we'll be glad
[23:57] just uh having a again possibility to
[24:00] send some new addresses if the people
[24:02] will listen uh streaming or whatever
[24:04] they can just come to about the chat and
[24:06] that's on the only our motive we don't
[24:09] have any organization
[24:10] just to propagate just the message of
[24:13] the hour
[24:13] we are so happy we are so blessed you
[24:15] are so privileged
[24:16] in poland just god open our eyes
[24:20] and we want to do something real for the
[24:22] kingdom of god
[24:24] amen so god bless you i ask you to stand
[24:26] up
[24:28] please my subject is for this morning
[24:31] the people of the eighth day
[24:34] the people of the eighth day is not just
[24:36] a doctrine of the eighth day
[24:38] or the scripture describing the eighth
[24:40] day but they are people of the eighth
[24:43] day
[24:44] amen so let's open the book of
[24:47] leviticus leviticus
[24:51] 23
[24:54] because book of leviticus 23
[24:58] from verse 33
[25:05] 33 and 34 is kind of background 4
[25:09] and 35 background for the 36.
[25:13] let's read it and the lord spake
[25:17] unto moses saying speak unto the
[25:21] children of israel saying the 15th day
[25:24] of the seventh month shall be the feast
[25:26] of tabernacles
[25:28] for seven days unto the lord we know the
[25:31] feel of
[25:32] the feast of tabernacles was the seventh
[25:34] feast in a seven
[25:35] month tishri it was a consummation of
[25:37] the
[25:38] whole religious year for jews and we
[25:41] know the
[25:42] fifth um feast was the feast of
[25:45] uh trumpets for ten days calling the
[25:47] people for the feast of yom kippur
[25:50] feast of atonement the the sixth feast
[25:53] and the seventh feast the feast of
[25:55] tabernacle was the last one and the last
[25:57] three
[25:58] feasts uh in the seven month history was
[26:01] connected
[26:02] with the second part of the year after
[26:05] the drought
[26:06] it was a harvest time the second harvest
[26:08] in the year and i
[26:10] we don't have a time to go into the
[26:11] details of the all seven church ages
[26:14] but we want to be focused on the seventh
[26:16] one
[26:17] uh but this is only background because
[26:19] the seven one is leading
[26:21] uh to the eighth day and just to
[26:24] understand those things
[26:26] we know that the first four uh feast
[26:29] in the bible jewish feast was connected
[26:31] with the first coming of the lord
[26:33] and the last three ephes in the seventh
[26:35] month was connected to the second coming
[26:37] of the lord
[26:38] but we will we will skip many things i'm
[26:41] sure that you are taught
[26:42] those things here and the those things
[26:44] will be familiar for you
[26:46] but let's go on and uh
[26:50] uh 35 the bible says
[26:54] on the first day shall be a
[26:57] holy convocation you shall

[28:25] beloved

[29:04] redemption

[29:16] and prudence
[29:17] having made known unto us the mystery of
[29:21] his will
[29:22] according to his good pleasure which he
[29:25] had purpose in himself
[29:28] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[29:30] of times
[29:32] he might gather together in one all
[29:34] things in christ
[29:36] both which are in heaven and which are
[29:39] on earth even
[29:40] in him in whom also we have
[29:44] obtained an inheritance being
[29:46] predestinated according to the purpose
[29:48] of him
[29:49] who worketh all things after the council
[29:52] of his
[29:53] own will that we should be to the praise
[29:56] of his glory

[31:20] better than ever before

[31:25] of your redemption to let us know who we

[31:32] that is here
[31:32] we know there's a boundaries of your
[31:34] grace you know there's abundance of your
[31:37] riches in glory but you shared your
[31:39] glory with
[31:40] your people father you shared your glory
[31:42] with your wife with the bride
[31:44] we are connected together when we ask
[31:47] you for mercy
[31:48] but you will just provide a mercy for
[31:50] every sick person
[31:52] every person in need of god maybe
[31:55] someone doesn't know you in the power of
[31:57] a resurrection
[31:58] there is a power of deliverance there is
[32:00] a power of redemption by your blood

[32:09] new beginning of father bless us we ask
[32:12] for that
[32:13] may everything will be for thy glory we
[32:15] ask for that
[32:16] in the precious name of lord jesus
[32:18] christ amen
[32:20] god bless you take your seeds
[32:23] amen so
[32:27] definitely we are living in time
[32:29] definitely we are surrounded by time
[32:31] definitely just we are linked with many
[32:34] things around us
[32:35] on daily basis that uh we cannot deny
[32:39] that we are living in flesh we cannot
[32:42] deny that we are human beings
[32:43] we cannot deny that we are living in
[32:45] time that we cannot deny there is the
[32:47] beginning of this meeting there is the
[32:49] end of the meeting
[32:50] we cannot deny that soon there will be a
[32:53] lunch time soon you will talk with
[32:55] someone you are thinking about to meet
[32:57] someone
[32:57] we are living in time we are time beings
[33:02] but this is a part of the truth
[33:05] because it would be a whole truth entire
[33:08] truth
[33:09] wouldn't be really a reason to come
[33:10] together here
[33:12] there is a mystery in the bible there is
[33:15] a mystery even uh
[33:16] beyond the redemption beyond the uh you
[33:19] know that his
[33:20] holy blood that was for you and me
[33:22] how we are living for
[33:24] uh for years in sin
[33:27] we've been bound by sin bound by
[33:30] circumstances
[33:31] bound by human thoughts and the feelings
[33:34] and the
[33:35] things it was like a prison but he
[33:38] redeemed us from our prison because his
[33:41] sacrifice was so perfect but it was not
[33:45] the end of the story when
[33:47] his blood was shed it was the beginning
[33:49] of the new story
[33:50] because we've been so veiled by
[33:54] tradition
[33:55] of so many years that we could
[33:58] just confess i believe in the blood i
[34:01] believe in jesus i believe he died for
[34:03] me
[34:04] but we saw very by tradition of
[34:06] christianity
[34:07] that the results of the word of god and
[34:10] the results of the shed blood
[34:12] didn't come even to us unless the veil
[34:16] was ranked
[34:17] in two and you saw that different
[34:19] picture
[34:20] you saw the reality of the redemption
[34:23] you saw the results
[34:25] of the blood of jesus christ because we
[34:28] know the
[34:29] chemistry of the blood cannot be proved
[34:32] today
[34:33] no one have it but we know that
[34:36] as a christian we've got the excess of
[34:38] life that was in the blood
[34:41] the chemistry of the blood of jesus
[34:42] christ was broken
[34:45] yes two thousand years ago but their
[34:47] life was released
[34:49] we've got access to life this is a
[34:52] different story
[34:54] than having a sandals or nails of the
[34:57] piece of the cross
[34:58] that jesus hung all the tradition blind
[35:02] the people
[35:04] so there is many many issues that uh in
[35:07] our life
[35:08] uh that we are dealing with but soon it
[35:11] will be
[35:11] uh finished many things will abolished
[35:16] uh disappear completely and it's like
[35:20] the week when we are living usually is
[35:22] from one to seven we know that
[35:24] uh this is uh earthly order this is even
[35:27] the order it got
[35:28] established from one to seven but i want
[35:31] to just talk about the
[35:33] eighth day and people of the eighth day
[35:36] that there is a day that represents the
[35:39] eternity
[35:41] we know the number eight is so simple
[35:43] you know that exactly but just to remind
[35:45] you
[35:45] you know that all the old order from one
[35:47] to seven
[35:48] is always the beginning and the end with
[35:50] every every number
[35:53] always the beginning and the end from
[35:55] one to seven
[35:56] all the time you go the beginning and
[35:59] the end
[36:00] and the end always like this
[36:03] but we are coming to the number of eight
[36:06] there's no beginning
[36:07] no end we know that exactly but this is
[36:11] really type in the bible
[36:13] but we want to see the reality god
[36:15] promised us not only
[36:16] symbols and types symbols in the bible
[36:19] are right
[36:20] because they are placed there by god
[36:23] through the prophets
[36:24] but we know that we need to get the
[36:26] understanding of
[36:28] of of the meaning of the symbol and then
[36:30] the revelation strikes your heart
[36:33] then the bible becomes a new book then
[36:35] you are not a traditional
[36:37] nominal christian but are a true
[36:39] believer
[36:40] but the symbol must be broken for you
[36:44] must be an interpretation understanding
[36:46] only by the holy ghost
[36:48] not by a man the bible is not written by
[36:50] a man
[36:52] is written through a man by god so god
[36:55] is the only one that is able to
[36:57] give you understanding real
[36:58] understanding of the word of god
[37:00] all the symbols all the shadows amen
[37:04] so we know that from one to seven is
[37:06] just the
[37:07] old order and we are physically still in
[37:11] that order
[37:12] we are living in the seven church h this
[37:15] is a physical
[37:16] uh final audition hh there is no eighth
[37:19] church h because with the seven is over
[37:23] this is a physical realm from one to
[37:26] seven seven church ages
[37:28] seven weeks or seven days in the week
[37:31] and but we know that the eight
[37:35] cannot be counted with the week
[37:38] see it cannot be counted eight days in a
[37:41] week
[37:42] there is no something like that you can
[37:45] do it
[37:46] because there is only seven days in a
[37:48] week
[37:49] count it any way you want to sunday is
[37:52] the first day of the week
[37:54] amen sunday first day of the new week
[38:00] new order this is the eighth day
[38:03] amen and we know the sunday the eighth
[38:06] day
[38:06] it was exactly you know god's show it in
[38:09] the bible
[38:10] we know that people like david just
[38:13] shortly touching only david
[38:15] david was the eighth son in the family
[38:19] you know that when the prophet samuel
[38:21] came to to find the king for israel
[38:24] he was looking and himself he was
[38:26] impressed by one
[38:28] he was impressed by the first one so he
[38:31] said probably this is the
[38:32] the biggest the tallest you know
[38:34] representation is the best
[38:36] he is the person god said no
[38:39] don't put the oil upon the first one so
[38:42] then he looked around
[38:43] you know and he found the second one you
[38:46] know this is a human thoughts that's how
[38:48] we
[38:48] are operating that's how we understand
[38:51] we
[38:51] we try the best we we've got our
[38:54] intellect and we are choosing the best
[38:56] not the worst
[38:59] you're choosing the best you are coming
[39:01] to church like this
[39:02] at the morning you don't take the the
[39:04] old clothes
[39:07] you choose the best because if the lord
[39:08] gave you something good
[39:10] you take the best coming here amen
[39:14] you don't take kind of rocks upon
[39:16] yourself with the
[39:17] like a sister will not just take a uh
[39:19] too short uh
[39:20] a skirt no you you you know that
[39:24] it will not please the lord you will
[39:25] grieve the holy spirit
[39:27] you take the best amen
[39:31] and also you don't want to live a double
[39:33] life you don't want to just clothing
[39:35] properly in the church and
[39:37] not properly outside of the church this
[39:39] is a double standard double life
[39:42] it doesn't work so we understand why we
[39:44] have to just
[39:45] catch really the vision of reality
[39:48] something that will be in us
[39:53] going together with god and that's how
[39:56] david he
[39:57] you know when he was there he was not
[39:59] even considered at the beginning because
[40:00] he was not
[40:01] part of the original group of the seven
[40:04] ones we know that
[40:07] so not the second not the third not the
[40:10] fifth
[40:11] and sixth and the seven and you know the
[40:13] prophet was looking around
[40:14] and god said even the seventh one is not
[40:16] the one i'm going to anoint
[40:20] so then he asked isai where is is there
[40:23] any more sans
[40:25] amen yes there is the eighth one
[40:28] but we didn't consider the eighth one
[40:31] the eight one is
[40:32] among the sheep he is a shepherd
[40:37] call him when he came from the
[40:39] wilderness he was alone privately
[40:42] he was with god he was a spiritual man
[40:45] writing the psalms and talking with god
[40:47] and he was a shepherd and
[40:49] you know he found the grace in the sight
[40:51] of god from the beginning
[40:53] only people they didn't recognize that
[40:55] that he was in the midst from the
[40:57] beginning
[40:58] he was a real shepherd real king but the
[41:01] people they couldn't
[41:02] comprehend it because he was not even
[41:04] over there
[41:06] when he came the eighth one david the
[41:09] eighth one
[41:10] god such a prophet annoyed him amen
[41:13] and all this wonder is from the
[41:15] beginning the part of the family
[41:17] that was not recognized is the one the
[41:20] eighth one
[41:20] david typing jesus christ
[41:24] amen noah in the bible
[41:28] noise called in the bible noah the
[41:32] eighth
[41:32] person amen
[41:36] noah the eighth person eight is an
[41:38] eternity
[41:39] no i was a man like you and me subject
[41:42] to the failures and different things
[41:45] but he was the eighth person
[41:49] it means he was coming from eternity and
[41:52] he was going back to eternity
[41:54] because number eight means eternity
[41:57] david was coming from god he had to come
[42:00] back to god
[42:02] doesn't matter how many failures he did
[42:04] he was predestinated person
[42:08] that's the reason number eight deals
[42:10] with a predestination
[42:12] for knowledge jesus he was the eighth
[42:15] person
[42:16] jesus we know he was resurrected not in
[42:19] the day of
[42:19] sabbath the seventh day but when the
[42:22] week was accomplished
[42:24] he was resurrected on the eighth day on
[42:27] sunday morning hallelujah
[42:31] jesus was the eighth day person he
[42:34] himself he said i came from the father
[42:36] i'm coming back to my father it was his
[42:42] identity
[42:45] amen you understand that when jesus was
[42:47] on the earth
[42:48] first time you've been in him
[42:52] i was in him not yet expressed but
[42:56] we've been in him when he said i came
[42:59] from the father
[43:00] i came back to the father it was your
[43:03] voice in those days
[43:05] when he said you said when he got quiet
[43:08] you kept quiet
[43:09] whatever he did you did amen
[43:15] in those days the first coming of the
[43:16] lord
[43:18] we've been silent because we've been
[43:21] hidden in him
[43:23] but the bridegroom was your voice
[43:27] christ was your voice we've been hitting
[43:30] him we didn't have our own voice
[43:34] we passed by our theophany we didn't
[43:37] know who we are
[43:38] we've been hitting him but he was our
[43:40] voice but today
[43:42] he is hidden jesus he said
[43:45] the world will not see me anymore
[43:49] you will see me because i will be with
[43:51] you even in you
[43:52] to the end of the world today
[43:56] people that are looking for jesus they
[43:58] cannot see him
[43:59] because he is hidden in his bride 2 000
[44:03] years ago
[44:04] he was your voice today you are his
[44:07] voice
[44:09] the bride of christ god promise she will
[44:11] be the final voice
[44:13] for the final age under her messenger
[44:17] amen so if he was the eighth person
[44:21] jesus
[44:25] eternal jesus we've been in him
[44:29] and now we are recognized so we can see
[44:32] the number eight
[44:33] it deals with eternity you understand
[44:37] that when i was preaching seven seals
[44:41] uh 24th of march
[44:45] 1963 when he was was sunday
[44:48] 24th of march sunday
[44:51] and the morning was the questions and
[44:53] answers on seals
[44:55] people they could express brother he
[44:57] asked just please just stay with that
[44:59] kind of questions connected with this
[45:04] people always they've got a different
[45:05] kind of questions
[45:07] even this morning maybe you've got a
[45:09] different question
[45:12] not connected with that but god had at
[45:15] his own root
[45:17] his own journey and 24th of march
[45:20] 1963 on sunday
[45:24] and the morning was a question answers
[45:25] on seals
[45:27] but sunday evening was a seventh seal
[45:32] it was not the seventh day it was the
[45:35] eighth day
[45:36] it was on sunday evening the evening
[45:38] time
[45:39] the eighth day was already presented and
[45:42] then
[45:43] the seventh seal from revelation eight 1
[45:46] was open the bible says
[45:49] in revelation 8 1 it was open
[45:53] the silent was in heaven but not on the
[45:56] earth
[45:57] because the seven thunders of their
[45:59] voices brother
[46:00] he said the seven thunders they don't
[46:03] utter their voices in heaven
[46:06] they are today voices on the earth amen
[46:09] when god and the man can come together
[46:12] as a result of
[46:13] redemption and people are coming to
[46:16] understanding
[46:17] we are not just human beings we are
[46:20] human beings
[46:21] but we are not just human beings you are
[46:23] more than a man
[46:25] you are more than women you are more
[46:28] than child
[46:29] more than teenager you are not a typical
[46:31] teenager
[46:32] you are more a teenager if you can
[46:34] recognize who you are
[46:36] all the battle today is around to
[46:39] recognize
[46:40] who i am not by the physical abilities
[46:44] not my mental understanding by my
[46:46] personal revelation of jesus christ to
[46:48] you
[46:50] god when he is able to take you from the
[46:53] seventh day
[46:55] of or maybe fifth day
[46:58] the fifth church age lutherans just
[47:01] justification
[47:02] this is right in the bible we believe it
[47:05] but you have to move on
[47:07] from the fifth day to the sixth day
[47:09] sanctification john wesley
[47:12] this is important we believe it but we
[47:14] have to just move on
[47:16] to the seventh day the seven days the
[47:18] baptism of the holy spirit
[47:20] this is part of the bible god promised
[47:22] that
[47:23] amen seven church h
[47:26] seventh day pentecostals this is all
[47:29] right
[47:29] but you have to move on there is more
[47:32] than these
[47:33] the seven series open showing the whole
[47:37] concept that was
[47:38] hidden in the mind of god before the
[47:40] foundation of the world
[47:41] mystery of god how god wanted to put
[47:44] together
[47:44] what was in heaven with what was on the
[47:47] earth
[47:47] in him in christ in the world in the
[47:51] revelation of the world
[47:52] in the living bible living book amen and
[47:55] you recognize this is not just the
[47:56] information
[47:57] that's me brother that's me my name is
[48:01] in the book the promises the verses in
[48:04] the bible that's me that's the reason
[48:06] why i listen
[48:07] a minister on the anointing of the holy
[48:09] spirit i'm gonna announce the
[48:11] eagle anointing he's preaching the
[48:13] mystery
[48:14] something jump up in my heart because
[48:16] that's me that's me
[48:18] this verse that's me the prophecy is me
[48:23] i understand my journey through all
[48:25] these days i can describe you when i was
[48:27] the first day on the second day
[48:29] third day but now i'm coming to
[48:31] something
[48:32] that i never even imagined will be
[48:35] available for me
[48:39] but the seventh seal was opened in
[48:42] revelation 8
[48:43] 1. it was a silence
[48:46] in heaven for a space of
[48:50] about half hour maybe 28 minutes
[48:55] of silence who was silent
[48:58] angels amen not human beings
[49:02] because we recognize we dealt last
[49:05] wednesday
[49:07] with the seventh unwritten song of
[49:09] solomon
[49:10] that was not written by him he
[49:13] overlooked it
[49:14] he had to do it he was a human being but
[49:17] when the great and the solomon came
[49:19] jesus christ he was great and the
[49:21] solomon was not just a gift of wisdom
[49:24] it was a spirit of wisdom and revelation
[49:28] and the spirit of wisdom and revelation
[49:29] cannot fail
[49:31] but the gift can fail and the seventh
[49:34] song of solomon
[49:35] unwritten one was sung in revelation 5.
[49:38] that's what we are talking last time
[49:40] about
[49:42] amen so there was a silence
[49:45] from the side of angels they didn't
[49:47] understand what was going on
[49:50] but something happened it was not a
[49:51] heaven group it was a
[49:53] bride amen brides group amen
[49:57] hallelujah so we are
[50:01] human beings yes but
[50:04] you are made for an eternal purpose
[50:07] because you was
[50:09] the manifestation of an attribute that
[50:11] was in god
[50:12] amen the thought of you and express you
[50:17] so he thought about you express you a
[50:20] certain age maybe
[50:21] your forefathers in the past
[50:25] but now express us because we
[50:28] have been his attribute and expressed us
[50:31] in that age to live under the messenger
[50:34] of that age
[50:35] to recognize the word of that age to
[50:38] manifest
[50:38] god for the dying people around us in
[50:41] that age
[50:43] but you are made for the eternal purpose
[50:46] remember that
[50:48] and the eternal purpose the eternity is
[50:50] eight
[50:51] eternal purpose must be eight number
[50:54] eight
[50:55] revelation eternity and he made
[50:59] a earth to take you out of
[51:03] and to make you a human being amen
[51:05] future home
[51:07] future home he made the earth
[51:11] for the purpose he made the earth to
[51:13] take you out of the earth
[51:16] hallelujah the purpose was not the earth
[51:19] the purpose was to create make the earth
[51:22] and take you out of the earth in the
[51:25] united states or
[51:26] or ukraine or china or congo
[51:30] or poland or czech republic or whatever
[51:33] this is the purpose why he placed us
[51:35] there amen
[51:37] to recognize one day that even when he
[51:40] made the globe
[51:41] you know and he just made my flesh out
[51:43] of the ground
[51:44] that's not me because i existed before
[51:49] you existed before he made the earth to
[51:52] just
[51:52] extract the portion of the of the
[51:55] minerals
[51:56] and he created a body but he placed you
[51:59] into the body you that existed before
[52:01] your body
[52:03] this is really connection with the egg
[52:05] day
[52:06] we have to understand we are coming from
[52:08] eternity we are coming back to eternity
[52:11] as jesus was we are in this world
[52:15] as he was we are equal why
[52:18] this is a power and the result of
[52:20] redemption
[52:21] not because i'm holding myself not
[52:23] because i'm perfect myself
[52:25] but i'm reside of his perfection
[52:28] i am just reside of his perfect
[52:31] sacrifice
[52:32] you are resolved outcome
[52:40] hallelujah praise god
[52:45] you know
[52:49] maybe you know the story maybe you heard
[52:51] it but
[52:52] there's a story about the
[52:55] little boy let's say a teenager he was a
[52:58] teenager and he dreamed to have a boat
[53:01] his own boat and
[53:04] one day he designed the boat in his mind
[53:07] and put it on the paper
[53:08] and then he collected materials and just
[53:11] made his own both
[53:12] it was a size like that he really
[53:14] enjoyed he put himself into that
[53:17] let's say he he reflected himself in the
[53:19] boat he loved it so much because no one
[53:22] just
[53:22] told him just do it like this or like
[53:24] that it was his
[53:25] own concept that he put it to the piece
[53:28] of the wood
[53:30] so every day after the school of course
[53:32] of course not during the school
[53:34] but after the school he was going to the
[53:37] lake and he was just playing with this
[53:39] boat
[53:40] and he really he really enjoyed
[53:43] to see how he's working what was in his
[53:45] mind he made it and he was working
[53:48] but after a certain time you know there
[53:50] was a strong wind like i i found it
[53:53] in the ohio you've got a strong winds
[53:55] like in poland
[53:57] uh so the strong wind came and blow the
[54:00] boat away
[54:01] so the boy he was really really crying
[54:03] he was really in desperation because
[54:05] part of his life his dream and
[54:07] everything was in the boat so
[54:11] some some weeks passed you know and he
[54:13] was going through his
[54:14] town you know and he looked there was a
[54:16] pawn shop and he looked through the
[54:18] glass
[54:19] and he looked and he saw his own boat he
[54:21] saw it again
[54:23] he thought his laws but it was there so
[54:25] he just rushed inside and he said to the
[54:27] salesman
[54:28] this is mine this is mine he said i'm
[54:30] sorry this is mine
[54:32] so he was a double despairer because he
[54:34] was looking at this and he couldn't just
[54:36] get it
[54:38] so he got the price he uh you know
[54:41] understood the price you know it was
[54:42] quite high
[54:44] it was a really really extraordinary
[54:45] vote so he just said he went very very
[54:48] discouraged to his home but the certain
[54:50] idea came to him just
[54:51] you i will take all things i have my
[54:53] bicycle
[54:54] my my my my toys my whatever
[54:57] instrument the tools whatever little
[55:00] things you know i will just
[55:01] sell it collect the money and go to a
[55:03] punk shop
[55:05] and try to redeem my boat that's what he
[55:08] did he collect the money he went there
[55:10] and he paid for the boat second time
[55:14] when he took the boat he was so excited
[55:17] he was so happy he just just ran out
[55:21] from the punk shop and he shouted you
[55:24] are
[55:24] mine you are man you are double mine
[55:28] because i made you and i redeem you
[55:31] you are double mine amen
[55:34] this is even greater now the feeling i
[55:37] have
[55:38] because i made you i lost you for a
[55:40] while but now i redeem you
[55:42] you are double mine
[55:46] my friends if you believe in the lord
[55:49] jesus christ as a reality
[55:51] i tell you if you receive the word the
[55:53] way it was presented for us in that
[55:55] age revelation must track your heart
[56:00] your double mine this is the voice of
[56:03] god today
[56:03] your double mind double mind i made you
[56:07] i redeem you you are double mine
[56:11] [Applause]
[56:12] devil never had the right to you
[56:15] but for a while it seems like in the
[56:18] order of the
[56:18] one to seven you can be up and down up
[56:21] and down you can be just too late you
[56:22] can be too early
[56:23] you can just miss the the the the train
[56:26] you can miss your job you can miss your
[56:29] even a marriage you can miss you can
[56:31] miss different things
[56:33] you can you can miss to be not to be
[56:35] millionaire doesn't matter what you mean
[56:37] from the one to seven
[56:38] but don't miss the revelation of the
[56:40] eighth day
[56:41] [Applause]
[56:43] don't misunderstanding that you are
[56:45] coming from eternity
[56:46] and jesus he became sin
[56:50] giving revelation that now you can
[56:52] become him
[56:54] by accepting his own righteousness
[56:57] righteousness of the eighth day
[56:59] that god himself not the man he paid the
[57:02] price for you
[57:04] he took a stand for you not the man
[57:07] jesus no was not the man he was more
[57:09] than man he was god in flesh he paid the
[57:12] price
[57:13] amen and he introduced after his
[57:17] crucifixion burial and resurrection
[57:20] he introduced a new order
[57:23] [Applause]
[57:24] new order order of melchizedek
[57:28] order of the eighth day order of
[57:30] eternity because he was rise up
[57:32] on the eighth day sunday morning a day
[57:36] outside of the old order understand that
[57:41] you love it oh brother and sister
[57:45] this is a great revelation why he placed
[57:48] you
[57:48] united states why he plays me in poland
[57:52] why he plays someone else in in china
[57:55] whatever it was his decision
[57:58] he made the earth around you know for
[58:01] that purpose
[58:03] amen to manifest some of us we are white
[58:06] some of them
[58:07] we are black some of them we are red or
[58:09] or yellow whatever
[58:10] it doesn't matter it's for the purpose
[58:14] god designed you amen he lost us for a
[58:18] while
[58:18] but now we are double he's
[58:22] hallelujah the book of colossians book
[58:24] of colossians chapter 3
[58:28] first four verses
[58:31] just to see if the poll he taught us to
[58:34] walk
[58:36] in the new concept because if jesus he
[58:40] was resurrected on the eighth day
[58:42] so it means that we've been resurrected
[58:45] with him on the eighth day
[58:47] if jesus was the eighth person if noah
[58:50] was the eighth person as a shadow in the
[58:52] old testament
[58:53] david was the eighth person as a shadow
[58:56] in the old testament
[58:57] jesus was not any shadow he was a
[58:59] reality
[59:00] when he was resurrected not on the
[59:02] seventh but on the eighth day
[59:05] we've been in him and paul he caught the
[59:08] revelation
[59:09] he caught understanding and he says book
[59:11] of colossians
[59:12] chapter three from the first one
[59:15] if you then be rised or risen i'm sorry
[59:19] if you then be risen with christ
[59:23] seek those things which are above
[59:27] if you are risen with christ if you are
[59:29] a person of the eighth day
[59:31] look up look for the things from above
[59:35] when a christ sitteth on the right hand
[59:38] of god
[59:38] you will say brother i don't understand
[59:40] exactly
[59:42] let's let's let's think like let's move
[59:44] now quickly
[59:45] in the history to the dark ages when our
[59:48] brothers and our sisters they were
[59:52] killed murdered by lions
[59:55] you know they had chopped off suffering
[59:58] alone not having a you know nice chair
[1:00:02] not having three meals or five meals or
[1:00:04] whatever is your diet or no meals
[1:00:06] they were really suffering really
[1:00:08] suffering
[1:00:10] no hope no joy nothing around you
[1:00:13] understand that
[1:00:14] nothing to touch and get a little
[1:00:16] consolation
[1:00:17] separated from mom separation from dead
[1:00:19] children separated from the parents
[1:00:21] parents from children they
[1:00:22] are separated from the pastor separated
[1:00:24] from the church killed summer
[1:00:26] caught killed tortured
[1:00:30] what do you think what you read right
[1:00:32] now was a cancellation for them or not
[1:00:36] question is maybe we don't understand
[1:00:37] having so many things that we can touch
[1:00:39] if you are sick you call to doctor okay
[1:00:44] if your car doesn't run you just you you
[1:00:47] don't lay hands on you on your car
[1:00:48] and pray because you've got the money in
[1:00:50] the pocket you go to the garage
[1:00:52] to repair it so our concept is
[1:00:54] completely different
[1:00:57] if i i've got a problem on friday and
[1:00:59] i'm the depths i've got a credit card
[1:01:01] what's the problem what's the problem
[1:01:04] more debts more debts you know
[1:01:06] this is the old concept this is wrong
[1:01:09] all those things
[1:01:10] around this this concept is wrong
[1:01:14] amen we use many things but we have to
[1:01:17] be
[1:01:18] prepared and trained because the seven
[1:01:22] number seven the seventh church h is the
[1:01:24] worst one of all seven
[1:01:27] it's allowed this yeah church h it's a
[1:01:29] wrong concept
[1:01:30] the people they follow especially the
[1:01:32] churches and so-called christians
[1:01:34] because we know that all the
[1:01:35] seven church ages east was the letters
[1:01:38] for christians
[1:01:41] so god rejected completely this concept
[1:01:44] even spewed out
[1:01:46] it was so bad and so wrong the seventh
[1:01:49] one
[1:01:50] is so corrupted but you know there are
[1:01:54] if we would be in such a conditions
[1:01:56] desperate in need
[1:01:57] you'd be so thankful to understand that
[1:02:00] you can accept the things from above
[1:02:03] there's reality above
[1:02:06] today they would say oh this is a
[1:02:07] spiritualism or whatever just why you
[1:02:09] think like that you're crazy
[1:02:11] yes i'm crazy yes i'm crazy for the
[1:02:14] for this world
[1:02:22] seek those things which are above
[1:02:26] where christ sitted on the right hand of
[1:02:28] god
[1:02:30] hallelujah the above things are real
[1:02:34] not what i taste touch see smell is not
[1:02:37] a reality
[1:02:38] reality is coming from above
[1:02:41] set your affections on the things above
[1:02:44] not on the things on the earth amen
[1:02:48] hallelujah can we do that france this
[1:02:50] morning
[1:02:52] put our affections on the things from
[1:02:54] above
[1:02:55] not those things that passes away
[1:02:57] earthly
[1:02:58] timely limited
[1:03:04] for you are dead amen
[1:03:10] and your life is hid with christ in god
[1:03:13] can you say amen when christ
[1:03:16] who is our life shall appear
[1:03:20] then shall you also appear with him in
[1:03:23] glory
[1:03:25] amen in glory that's what the paul he
[1:03:28] called the revelation he taught romans
[1:03:31] in eighth chapter he said oh let go god
[1:03:34] foresaw
[1:03:36] and those that even saw before the
[1:03:38] foundation of the world
[1:03:40] he has chosen he predestinated them he
[1:03:43] called them he justified them he
[1:03:45] glorified them
[1:03:46] in the past tense we can dispute with
[1:03:50] this but it's not my problem
[1:03:52] it's not your problem it's a problem the
[1:03:54] people with the bible
[1:03:56] they don't accept the bible as a new
[1:03:58] book as a reality
[1:04:00] as christ that came down amen
[1:04:04] to be united with his bride this is a
[1:04:07] new age this is a you know the new age
[1:04:09] of the
[1:04:10] of the of the old age is a new age
[1:04:13] this is a new mystery that was hidden in
[1:04:15] the bible
[1:04:16] uniting time and sign when the christ
[1:04:18] the bride that well
[1:04:20] [Applause]
[1:04:21] every scripture in the bible every
[1:04:23] prophecy depicts
[1:04:24] jesus christ but you cannot stop with
[1:04:27] this
[1:04:28] you have to see christ in every verse of
[1:04:31] that bible
[1:04:33] every verse but then don't put a full
[1:04:36] stop
[1:04:37] continue have a fellowship with him
[1:04:40] don't be afraid of him don't be afraid
[1:04:43] of the world don't be afraid of the
[1:04:44] message
[1:04:45] don't be afraid of the eagles anointing
[1:04:47] that is leading you to a throne to the
[1:04:49] reality of god
[1:04:50] be open discover that you can have a
[1:04:54] relationship not with a doctrine with a
[1:04:56] person
[1:04:58] we've got relationship today with that
[1:05:01] person of the lord jesus christ
[1:05:03] and then he will find the grace in his
[1:05:07] side
[1:05:08] then he will lead you deeper because you
[1:05:11] will not see only christ in every verse
[1:05:13] of the bible
[1:05:14] you will see also yourself in every
[1:05:17] verse of the bible
[1:05:19] and then the perfect faith rapture in
[1:05:21] faith is rising up your heart
[1:05:23] supernatural element something not from
[1:05:26] this earth
[1:05:27] every theologian can study every day i
[1:05:29] don't know how many hours
[1:05:32] but it comes by grace and abundance of
[1:05:36] grace
[1:05:37] it comes by his sovereign choice
[1:05:40] that he has chosen us before the
[1:05:42] foundation of the world
[1:05:44] in himself
[1:05:48] no one was able to steer up stir up his
[1:05:51] feeling
[1:05:52] or his decision or his love it was his
[1:05:55] own love towards the bride he's chosen
[1:05:59] you in himself
[1:06:01] privately it was his decision
[1:06:04] that's the reason no one can stop it if
[1:06:07] you have been in god and chosen in god
[1:06:10] no one is able to stop it there's no
[1:06:12] demons
[1:06:13] no darkness power nothing no negative no
[1:06:17] complex nothing not your breakdown no
[1:06:20] whatever
[1:06:22] nothing can stop you for the love of god
[1:06:24] because you've been chosen in love
[1:06:26] before the foundation of the world
[1:06:29] amen so the paul he's teaching those
[1:06:32] things
[1:06:34] and he said for you are
[1:06:38] dead and your life is healed with christ
[1:06:40] in god
[1:06:42] when christ who is our life shall appear
[1:06:46] we are living in the time of appearing
[1:06:48] of the son of man
[1:06:50] he christ himself he appeared amen
[1:06:53] he tear the sky scientists
[1:06:57] not the believers not will scientists
[1:07:00] prove this was real
[1:07:01] who can question that tell me inside
[1:07:04] person
[1:07:05] that's all right this is reality
[1:07:09] it was real it was tested from every
[1:07:12] angle
[1:07:13] amen now after years they can say
[1:07:14] whatever they want
[1:07:16] with an insane condition
[1:07:18] [Music]
[1:07:20] like a pharisee is a sad disease when
[1:07:22] they rejected jesus christ nothing
[1:07:23] happened
[1:07:24] directly but 40 years later they paid
[1:07:27] for every word they spoke against it
[1:07:31] amen you can say something against the
[1:07:34] son of man
[1:07:35] but when he appears himself christ the
[1:07:38] holy ghost
[1:07:41] amen he's so gracious for us friends
[1:07:45] when he shall appear then
[1:07:48] shall you also appear with him in glory
[1:07:53] it doesn't mean you'll be a glorious
[1:07:55] angel like that
[1:07:58] no no but you'll appear in glory
[1:08:02] you'll have access to glory the bride
[1:08:04] she's
[1:08:05] his glory because the woman the wife
[1:08:08] she's the glory of the husband
[1:08:10] and he was revealed you've been revealed
[1:08:13] that's the reason how can bridegroom
[1:08:14] come and wouldn't be the bride
[1:08:17] it's a bright coming of christ when he
[1:08:20] was manifested
[1:08:21] wherever is christ i am i'm identified
[1:08:25] hallelujah we've been there two days ago
[1:08:27] on the ohio
[1:08:29] river in the place in 19
[1:08:32] in 1933 the lord came down
[1:08:37] you know the pit of fire
[1:08:40] and the voice came as the john the
[1:08:42] baptist was sent before the
[1:08:43] first coming of the lord your message
[1:08:45] before around the second coming of the
[1:08:46] lord
[1:08:48] i was just happy not in my emotions but
[1:08:51] in my inner being
[1:08:52] i said about the child and by the nathan
[1:08:54] i said i'm here
[1:08:56] the second time when a commission the
[1:08:59] great commission was spoken
[1:09:01] i was there
[1:09:04] because the pit of fire the logos is the
[1:09:07] fullness of god's attributes
[1:09:09] [Applause]
[1:09:11] fullness of god's attributes moses
[1:09:13] jeremiah
[1:09:14] paul amen all of them you and me
[1:09:18] we've been part of a pit of fire but
[1:09:20] everyone was
[1:09:21] expressed in his own age
[1:09:25] so in 1933 we've been there not yet
[1:09:28] expressed in the flesh
[1:09:30] now is a greater time wonderful time
[1:09:33] you've been a thought attribute of god
[1:09:35] in the period of fire
[1:09:38] but now it's a greater time because the
[1:09:39] thought of god is expressed
[1:09:42] you've been spoken to existence by the
[1:09:45] powder spoken word
[1:09:47] that's the reason god sent the monarchy
[1:09:48] for prophet he spoke the word
[1:09:51] he said it was not me god only use my
[1:09:54] vocal vocal chords my vocal cords
[1:09:58] but it was he himself was standing
[1:10:00] inside of me he was using my voice
[1:10:03] but it was himself revelation of the
[1:10:05] seals is not a revelation of
[1:10:07] so-so message kind of message he was a
[1:10:10] revelation of christ
[1:10:12] christ he put off seals of himself
[1:10:15] when he was unveiled you've been
[1:10:17] unveiled because you are identified with
[1:10:18] him
[1:10:20] paul he said you are dead
[1:10:24] you are dead and your life is hit
[1:10:28] with christ in god wherever christ is
[1:10:30] manifest revealed
[1:10:32] you are there you are there this is our
[1:10:34] identification
[1:10:35] this is our unity with him that we know
[1:10:38] wherever he is
[1:10:41] i am as he is
[1:10:44] as he is in this world
[1:10:48] we are amen the bible says
[1:10:53] as he is i am
[1:10:56] that i am not i was i
[1:11:00] i will be i am the eighth day eternity
[1:11:04] in flesh as he is as jesus
[1:11:08] is in this world that's what john said
[1:11:11] the eagle
[1:11:12] eagle's anointing reveals that he said
[1:11:15] as
[1:11:15] jesus is in this world we are
[1:11:23] amen he was the word 2000 years ago
[1:11:27] we are the living word today that's what
[1:11:31] the paul he taught
[1:11:32] we are the open book we are the open
[1:11:34] book
[1:11:36] people can read they supposed to read
[1:11:38] the word am i right
[1:11:40] we're supposed to live a life his own
[1:11:42] life nothing less
[1:11:45] amen when christ who is our life
[1:11:48] shall appear then shall you also appear
[1:11:51] with him in glory
[1:11:53] amen we are identified recognized in him
[1:11:57] hallelujah do you love him
[1:12:01] you know that jesus he he said verily
[1:12:04] verily i say unto you
[1:12:07] let's open this this is not my language
[1:12:10] i want to be
[1:12:12] sure saint john chapter 5
[1:12:20] 24.
[1:12:28] it's important but it's also
[1:12:31] wonderful saint john chapter 5
[1:12:36] 24.
[1:12:47] verily verily i say unto you
[1:12:50] he that heareth my word and believe it
[1:12:53] on him
[1:12:54] that sent me hath at everlasting life
[1:12:58] and shall not come into condemnation but
[1:13:01] is
[1:13:02] passed from death and to life
[1:13:07] we can believe it or not but if he is
[1:13:10] zoe
[1:13:11] zoe life we are so alive as well
[1:13:14] because by accepting his word
[1:13:18] revelation of his word by accepting him
[1:13:21] himself in the fullness of his word you
[1:13:24] will not go to
[1:13:25] condemnation you will not go to
[1:13:27] tribulation period
[1:13:29] you pass from death and to life you've
[1:13:31] got the life
[1:13:32] literal life of god right now right now
[1:13:36] the eighth day you pass from the seventh
[1:13:38] day to eight day amen
[1:13:40] from the old order the new order amen
[1:13:42] from the order of levites
[1:13:44] one to seven to the order of melchizedek
[1:13:49] he was without the father without the
[1:13:50] mother without the beginning without the
[1:13:51] end
[1:13:53] amen like a circle
[1:13:57] without the father without the mother we
[1:13:58] are the beginning we have the end
[1:14:01] hallelujah and he's got the children
[1:14:06] mercy without the father without the
[1:14:09] mother without the beginning without the
[1:14:10] end of the days
[1:14:11] and he's got the children amen we are
[1:14:14] his children
[1:14:15] we are the children of melchizedek amen
[1:14:20] we've got the beginning and the end of
[1:14:22] this earthly journey
[1:14:25] but inside of you there is an eternal
[1:14:27] being
[1:14:28] and you pass from death unto life there
[1:14:31] is no condemnation for the bride
[1:14:34] there is definitely condemnation for the
[1:14:36] seventh h
[1:14:38] but there is no condemnation for the
[1:14:40] people of the eighth day
[1:14:42] because amen is coming so many things
[1:14:46] when the seven was over there was a
[1:14:48] revelation for one
[1:14:51] come up higher john come up higher and
[1:14:53] he found himself in the rapture
[1:14:56] in the eternity after seven church ages
[1:14:59] he was lifted up raptured amen
[1:15:02] and he saw someone he saw someone
[1:15:06] amen when he was in the spirit
[1:15:08] hallelujah
[1:15:09] can you see you understand that we can
[1:15:12] only explain everything we don't want to
[1:15:13] even do it
[1:15:15] but just we are touching here and there
[1:15:17] in the world different places and the
[1:15:18] holy spirit is here to put it together
[1:15:21] just to to give you a clear-cut picture
[1:15:24] that you will not live under
[1:15:26] condemnation of the seventh-day
[1:15:28] condemnation of the laodicea we are in a
[1:15:31] different time
[1:15:32] we pass from the death to life he is zoe
[1:15:35] life
[1:15:37] we are so alive because we are coming
[1:15:39] from him
[1:15:40] and coming back to him amen
[1:15:43] future home amen
[1:15:47] we lived through all these types in here
[1:15:51] but when you hit the eight
[1:15:54] you go on into eternity
[1:15:58] but now he describes you know that all
[1:16:00] this seven and different
[1:16:02] uh you know sabbats and full moons and
[1:16:06] different things you know it was all
[1:16:07] connected with time
[1:16:09] but he said we just we we passed
[1:16:13] when you hit the eight you go
[1:16:16] on into eternity okay you you think that
[1:16:20] maybe this future brother this future
[1:16:22] you understand i'm hungry
[1:16:24] you understand i i feel pain
[1:16:27] it has nothing to do with this because
[1:16:30] your inner being
[1:16:31] is is eternal god's attribute
[1:16:35] expressed in flesh in your flesh my
[1:16:38] flesh
[1:16:39] and flesh has nothing to do this is part
[1:16:41] of the earth
[1:16:42] it is a dying it is it can be a this or
[1:16:45] that shape you know troubles up and down
[1:16:47] but
[1:16:48] you are more than the flesh
[1:16:51] when you hit the age you go on into
[1:16:53] eternity
[1:16:55] you don't come by laws and rituals
[1:16:58] and orders you come by predestination
[1:17:01] you come by predestination amen there is
[1:17:04] a genuine
[1:17:05] holy convocation
[1:17:09] see and we are ending the seventh church
[1:17:13] age
[1:17:14] we the people not the doctrine
[1:17:19] not the kind of teaching but we are
[1:17:21] ending
[1:17:22] the seventh church age are you with me
[1:17:26] are you able you are willing to end the
[1:17:29] worst one
[1:17:32] we are ending the seventh church age
[1:17:36] the pentecostal age we are ending
[1:17:40] we are finishing why because we
[1:17:42] recognize i'm not any more part of it
[1:17:46] if my jesus the word was rejected
[1:17:50] only in the seventh church edge he was
[1:17:52] kicked out from the church
[1:17:54] he was kicked out and now going beyond
[1:17:57] the camp i'm
[1:17:58] identified with him i'm going with him
[1:18:02] from the seven to the eight he is
[1:18:05] misunderstood i am misunderstood
[1:18:07] that's obvious whoa
[1:18:10] whoa unto us ministers
[1:18:13] if everyone will talk nicely about us
[1:18:17] whoa whoa unto you christian if everyone
[1:18:20] is speaking nicely about you
[1:18:23] some of them they will speak nicely god
[1:18:25] bless them
[1:18:26] some of them they will be nasty god
[1:18:30] bless them anyhow but
[1:18:33] play your role don't be wishy-washy
[1:18:37] don't be compromising be christian don't
[1:18:40] be afraid
[1:18:41] don't be discouraged i criticize you
[1:18:44] friends this is part of life
[1:18:48] wait a little don't worry
[1:18:52] we are ending the seven church age
[1:18:55] pentecostal age we are entering
[1:19:01] the holy convocation we are entering
[1:19:03] into the real
[1:19:05] genuine eternity where the church
[1:19:09] is cult
[1:19:12] you understand that this is a present
[1:19:14] tense
[1:19:17] let's carefully listen
[1:19:20] watch yourself what the time you're
[1:19:22] living right now
[1:19:24] the pentecostal church age is over
[1:19:27] for the bride of christ because we pass
[1:19:30] on the seventh to the eighth
[1:19:33] holy convocation we are entering into
[1:19:36] the real genuine eternity
[1:19:37] where the church is called not to some
[1:19:40] station
[1:19:41] some denomination but into eternity
[1:19:44] with day eternal king
[1:19:48] amen we are not alone we are entering to
[1:19:51] the eternal kingdom with our eternal
[1:19:53] king our husband
[1:19:55] we are one uniting time and sign in this
[1:19:58] evil euro of the bride of christ
[1:20:00] amen the token literal life of christ
[1:20:03] christ the mystery of god revealed pride
[1:20:05] is a mystery of christ revealed amen
[1:20:09] we are the prisoners of christ prisoners
[1:20:11] of love
[1:20:12] amen what the hourly right now
[1:20:19] praise god the rapture
[1:20:22] and the things that are to be but he
[1:20:24] said i would like to connect it together
[1:20:27] rapture is a revelation for the bride
[1:20:29] revelation not only event
[1:20:32] this is revelation we're supposed to be
[1:20:35] under revelation
[1:20:36] of the rapture he's supposed to move all
[1:20:39] in our hearts
[1:20:42] how you know how you know that the
[1:20:45] rapture is not
[1:20:46] going on all the time how do you know
[1:20:49] you know by revelation
[1:20:53] amen but god is hiding and revealing
[1:20:56] himself in simplicity
[1:20:59] showing the passage from the seventh to
[1:21:01] the eighth
[1:21:03] how you know that the rapture is not
[1:21:06] going on all the time this is a
[1:21:08] different dimension
[1:21:09] it's a circle all the time eternity you
[1:21:12] are part of it or not
[1:21:14] amen we are living in the seventh i call
[1:21:18] the flesh there
[1:21:19] is the feast of tabernacles we are
[1:21:20] observing right now feast of tabernacles
[1:21:22] amen
[1:21:23] that's for the church we've been the
[1:21:25] time for thousand years
[1:21:28] in a feast of tabernacles still a time
[1:21:32] we've got to steal the thousand years of
[1:21:34] time ahead of us
[1:21:36] but god not by accident
[1:21:40] he put the seventh together with the
[1:21:42] eight and he didn't introduce the eighth
[1:21:45] feast but the seven feasts but he said
[1:21:49] when the seventh feast after seven days
[1:21:53] will be finished he will come to the
[1:21:54] eighth day
[1:21:57] the seventh and the eighties coming
[1:21:59] together
[1:22:00] this is just a breach you are living
[1:22:03] something and going into something
[1:22:06] and this is the biggest challenge
[1:22:07] because the christian tradition
[1:22:08] tradition
[1:22:10] of the pentecostal church age is so
[1:22:12] heavy on people
[1:22:13] but by the grace of god eternal king is
[1:22:17] here
[1:22:19] king god king jesus king theophany
[1:22:22] king theophany amen he came down
[1:22:25] as a thief in the night to be connected
[1:22:28] with you
[1:22:29] do you love him hallelujah
[1:22:34] you are in eternity
[1:22:38] with eternal king not a station
[1:22:41] no denomination we came to reality
[1:22:45] like a projectile son we came to
[1:22:47] ourselves
[1:22:48] we just discovered something from the
[1:22:50] another dimension
[1:22:52] we are discovering something doesn't
[1:22:54] matter what kind of education you have
[1:22:56] what kind of background you have you are
[1:22:59] wealthy or poor or or or beautiful or
[1:23:02] not beautiful
[1:23:03] doesn't matter it doesn't matter this is
[1:23:06] this is the level when the devil
[1:23:08] tries to distract us but he will just
[1:23:11] recognize
[1:23:12] the eternal king made me part of eternal
[1:23:16] kingdom
[1:23:17] and i am his kingdom i am the place of
[1:23:20] his rest
[1:23:21] he came down to be identified with me
[1:23:23] and he's calling me out of the seventh
[1:23:25] to the eighth and he teaches me how to
[1:23:28] walk in the conscious
[1:23:29] of the being the eighth person amen
[1:23:34] hallelujah eight days deals with the new
[1:23:38] creation
[1:23:39] amen see not old creation
[1:23:43] eight days is new creation
[1:23:46] who is really a christ jesus is a new
[1:23:49] creation
[1:23:50] what kind of creation i lift up my hand
[1:23:53] i joined to the church this church other
[1:23:55] church no
[1:23:55] i am creation of the world amen
[1:23:58] god thought spoke i'm here and i believe
[1:24:01] the world i believe the bible
[1:24:03] i love the world i love to feed my soul
[1:24:06] with the living word of god because
[1:24:08] i'm coming from the eighth day and i
[1:24:10] know that soon i will go back to a day
[1:24:12] [Applause]
[1:24:15] lord just by purpose he dropped me into
[1:24:18] the time
[1:24:19] but i'm not the creature of time that's
[1:24:22] the reason we can have two voices
[1:24:24] paul he said the flesh is fighting
[1:24:26] against the spirit the spirit against
[1:24:28] the flesh
[1:24:29] that's really what i'm talking about the
[1:24:31] flesh we tell you always you are just
[1:24:33] early bound sober you'll never get out
[1:24:37] of the problem
[1:24:38] you will never get out of the sin you
[1:24:40] will never just overcome it
[1:24:42] yes you did it already in jesus christ
[1:24:45] you did it already
[1:24:46] what you need is your personal
[1:24:48] revelation that you are free
[1:24:49] [Music]
[1:24:50] you just want to pray you have to pray
[1:24:53] right now in your heart
[1:24:55] quietly lord help me amen
[1:24:58] let me see myself in the eighth day even
[1:25:01] if i i will troubles in my
[1:25:03] seventh day in the laodicea church age
[1:25:05] let me see something more
[1:25:07] since he will lift you up higher you
[1:25:10] will see what the john he saw
[1:25:11] what he saw in the revelation 4 1 after
[1:25:14] seven
[1:25:14] in the eighth in eternity he saw someone
[1:25:16] on the throne
[1:25:18] but you will see jesus christ on the
[1:25:21] throne on
[1:25:22] your life your heart your problem
[1:25:24] doesn't matter what it is
[1:25:26] it's over your sickness is over
[1:25:30] because you know that your sickness is
[1:25:32] timely your complex is timely
[1:25:34] everything is timely depth timely i
[1:25:36] don't know what what what next
[1:25:38] is timely but you will see the vision
[1:25:42] of christ himself sitting on the throne
[1:25:45] this is the eighth day hallelujah
[1:25:50] jesus rise from the dead for our
[1:25:53] justification
[1:25:55] on the eighth day we know that after the
[1:25:58] seven sabbaths or
[1:25:59] seven days seven church ages
[1:26:02] jesus rised from the dead amen
[1:26:07] again

[1:26:13] people easily
[1:26:15] how can jesus
[1:26:18] be resurrected again he's resurrected in
[1:26:21] the form of the bride
[1:26:23] because a seed was planted two thousand
[1:26:25] years ago
[1:26:26] and jesus he said if the seed will just
[1:26:28] say by one seed just
[1:26:30] uh and you will never die stay one seed
[1:26:33] it was christ christ was the word the
[1:26:35] seed
[1:26:36] the wheat there's the reason the
[1:26:38] gentiles the greeks they couldn't see
[1:26:40] him but he said
[1:26:41] one day you will see it when the the the
[1:26:44] sea will be put to the ground and the
[1:26:46] dark ages will come and it got rotten
[1:26:49] and and and
[1:26:50] redestroyed by the germ the mystery the
[1:26:53] germ in the seed
[1:26:54] stays doesn't matter how the church was
[1:26:57] weak in the seven church ages
[1:26:58] in the dark ages through luther wesley
[1:27:02] pentacostas up and now is the time of
[1:27:05] reproduction
[1:27:07] complete seed is again on the on the
[1:27:10] earth
[1:27:11] does the reason jesus christ rise up
[1:27:13] from the dead
[1:27:15] in the form of the bride amen you
[1:27:18] understand that
[1:27:19] the church is standing right the side of
[1:27:21] him amen the bride the bridegroom

[1:27:42] even eternal age
[1:27:43] bright's age new age
[1:27:47] we are still in the bible we are still
[1:27:50] in the bible
[1:27:51] we still preach from the bible if we
[1:27:53] still preach from the open book
[1:27:55] nothing can stand against it because
[1:27:58] this is a living word
[1:27:59] in flesh again amen people around
[1:28:02] us they know it what the grace
[1:28:07] that was given to you not to be just a
[1:28:10] witness
[1:28:11] but to be eyewitness not only watch
[1:28:14] the word of god manifest in that age but
[1:28:16] be part of it
[1:28:18] by the marriage being part of it when
[1:28:21] you left the seventh when you left the
[1:28:22] laodicea
[1:28:23] when you left the position of vashti you
[1:28:26] came to the position of esther
[1:28:28] in the eighth day amen
[1:28:32] marriage you know your partner your
[1:28:34] husband your wife is eternal partner in
[1:28:36] glory

[1:28:41] eternal partner in glory

[1:28:49] world around us is so deceived so
[1:28:51] corrupted
[1:28:53] but we've got something not from here
[1:28:54] not from the seven church ages
[1:28:56] not from the seven messengers there's a
[1:28:58] mighty one came down
[1:29:00] we've got something directly from the
[1:29:02] headquarter
[1:29:05] hallelujah amen
[1:29:09] the first episode of john i will finish
[1:29:11] soon but by the chat he told me
[1:29:13] this is sunday one meeting and he just
[1:29:16] doesn't preach
[1:29:17] uh shorter than two hours i don't have
[1:29:19] no concept you know what's the hour
[1:29:21] because my clock is
[1:29:22] polish time i don't know i can see a
[1:29:26] clock over there but
[1:29:27] i cannot see very well
[1:29:30] just a little time please a little time
[1:29:33] just to finish first epistle of john
[1:29:37] chapter 3
[1:29:38] from verse 14 first epistle of john
[1:29:44] chapter 3 from verse 14
[1:29:48] amen we know that
[1:29:51] we have passed from death and to life we
[1:29:54] know
[1:29:55] we know you know the paul he was a
[1:29:57] hebrew
[1:29:59] and you know new testament is in greek
[1:30:02] old testament is in hebrew we know there
[1:30:04] is a difference between
[1:30:06] uh to know in the old testament to say
[1:30:09] i know being a hebrew and i know being
[1:30:11] greek
[1:30:13] because for uh greek to know something
[1:30:16] is just a knowledge
[1:30:18] but for a hebrew to know something
[1:30:21] it's experience that's the reason the
[1:30:23] bible says when the adam he
[1:30:25] he known known if
[1:30:28] okay so it's even is going to the
[1:30:31] personal intercourse
[1:30:32] it's really really genuine
[1:30:36] to know and when the when the
[1:30:39] john when john he was he was hebrew as
[1:30:42] well
[1:30:43] and the bible the new testament was in
[1:30:45] greek but i believe he understood
[1:30:48] what he said john he said we know
[1:30:51] that we have passed from death and to
[1:30:54] life
[1:30:54] we know we know by personal experience
[1:30:59] we experience that what it means to have
[1:31:01] a zoey life inside
[1:31:03] we understand that jesus that we walk
[1:31:06] with
[1:31:07] is walking in us right now we understand
[1:31:10] that he was above
[1:31:11] us one god with us one god
[1:31:14] and he's in us one god they understood
[1:31:17] constant condescending of god we know
[1:31:20] we passed from death unto life because
[1:31:23] we love
[1:31:24] the brethren he that loveth
[1:31:27] he that loved not his brother abided
[1:31:30] in death whosoever hated his brother is
[1:31:33] a murderer
[1:31:34] and you know that no murderer had
[1:31:37] eternal life
[1:31:38] abiding in him amen so now he's just
[1:31:41] showing you know how god's life
[1:31:44] can be in us it must be love of god
[1:31:48] because eternal life is the holy spirit
[1:31:50] holy spirit is a capstone
[1:31:52] capstone is a christ himself holy ghost
[1:31:54] and christ the same person
[1:31:56] if he is in us he must do exactly the
[1:31:59] same
[1:31:59] what he was doing before what he was
[1:32:02] doing when he was on the cross in the
[1:32:03] third pool
[1:32:04] of his ministry there was a signs
[1:32:07] wonders
[1:32:08] prophecy and the third part of his
[1:32:10] ministry what jesus was doing on the
[1:32:11] cross
[1:32:13] he said father forgive them
[1:32:16] what about stephen stephen was not jesus
[1:32:18] but jesus was in stephen
[1:32:20] when jesus was when stephen was accused
[1:32:22] in the book of acts
[1:32:24] that he trespassed law and telling
[1:32:27] evil things against moses and so forth
[1:32:30] you know he was doing
[1:32:31] uh signs and wonders bible says
[1:32:34] he was discerning the condition by
[1:32:37] prophecy
[1:32:38] but the third pool of his ministry
[1:32:42] when astonishing stephen what he was
[1:32:44] doing
[1:32:46] steven was not jesus but jesus the holy
[1:32:48] spirit was in stephen
[1:32:50] how we know it because when he was
[1:32:52] stoned he prayed for the enemies
[1:32:56] and the heaven was open it was a third
[1:32:58] pool
[1:32:59] of his ministry he was not the preacher
[1:33:01] he was
[1:33:02] he was a deacon amen he was not jesus
[1:33:05] but jesus was in stephen
[1:33:07] and jesus in the form of the holy ghost
[1:33:09] the same one that was above
[1:33:11] with now was he stephen what he was
[1:33:14] doing was praying for the enemies
[1:33:17] why the capstone christ not yet
[1:33:20] completely unveiled
[1:33:22] like we've got today was in him but a
[1:33:25] character must be the same
[1:33:28] jesus was he blessed the enemies what
[1:33:30] the stephen did
[1:33:31] he did the same by the spirit
[1:33:35] that was living in him that's the reason
[1:33:37] john he said we know
[1:33:39] that we have passed from death unto life
[1:33:42] because we love brothers
[1:33:44] amen amen we love brothers
[1:33:48] we laugh even those that don't love us
[1:33:50] because this is a condition for adoption
[1:33:52] jesus he said that
[1:33:53] how you can be considered as a son of as
[1:33:55] a son of god
[1:33:57] and the spirit adoption will be upon you
[1:33:58] he will not just if you will greet only
[1:34:00] the brothers
[1:34:02] we greet the brothers and we we we greet
[1:34:05] also the enemies
[1:34:06] if we cannot do it we say lord jesus
[1:34:08] help us help us help me to live a life
[1:34:11] like that
[1:34:11] help me not to be
[1:34:14] you know limited by by my own
[1:34:18] conscious my own thinking understanding
[1:34:21] but let me take something from the
[1:34:23] eighth day
[1:34:25] like jesus did on the calvary he knew
[1:34:28] exactly who he was
[1:34:29] he he knew exactly it must be this way
[1:34:32] that's the reason he prayed for the
[1:34:33] enemies
[1:34:34] stephen he knew that he must be this way
[1:34:37] because the paul was a part of the group
[1:34:40] he knew that if i would be stoned i
[1:34:43] would be faithful to the end
[1:34:45] he saw jesus he saw heaven open
[1:34:50] and he blessed those people and he
[1:34:51] prayed for them and the paul was there
[1:34:54] but he said since this moment paul he
[1:34:57] couldn't sleep
[1:34:58] he couldn't just live a normal life he
[1:35:01] was so much against the church
[1:35:02] but you know really the death of stephen
[1:35:05] troubled him
[1:35:07] and this is really like this when jesus
[1:35:09] was crucified devil he thought oh it's
[1:35:12] over
[1:35:13] we know that if he would have a concept
[1:35:15] why jesus died
[1:35:16] he would just protect him and never just
[1:35:19] allow him to come to the cross
[1:35:23] because when jesus was crucified with
[1:35:25] the first shot was 120 rise
[1:35:28] up with the same spirit it was a really
[1:35:31] trouble
[1:35:32] for the kingdom of satan there was a
[1:35:34] three thousand five thousand
[1:35:36] what about stephen you cannot you can
[1:35:39] stop messenger you cannot stop the
[1:35:42] spirit in the messenger
[1:35:43] you cannot stop the message
[1:35:46] when the pharisees sadducees they stoned
[1:35:48] stephen they thought
[1:35:50] it's over such a bad
[1:35:53] evil doctrine heresy
[1:35:56] we stop it we kill the guy it was like
[1:36:00] the biggest mistake
[1:36:01] because instead of stephen paul rise up
[1:36:05] [Applause]
[1:36:06] amen whatever devil does
[1:36:09] is losing always never think never think
[1:36:13] that you are losing you cannot lose
[1:36:15] if you see heaven open you have a spirit
[1:36:18] of god spirit of christ in you
[1:36:20] if you know that you pass from death
[1:36:22] unto life you love your brothers
[1:36:24] you love your enemies you are not losing
[1:36:27] you cannot do that
[1:36:30] you are winning you will see amen
[1:36:35] when the devil will deceive
[1:36:38] one minister just one minister
[1:36:45] you know instead of this minister rise
[1:36:47] up the other ministers the
[1:36:48] real ones amen
[1:36:52] because god promised that the bride the
[1:36:54] last day she will be without the spot
[1:36:56] without a wrinkle should be perfect
[1:37:00] so whatever was in the one to seven
[1:37:03] doesn't matter how many impersonations
[1:37:06] existed
[1:37:07] will be a bride amen nothing can stop us
[1:37:11] friends
[1:37:12] be brave have revelation be thankful
[1:37:16] don't be discouraged eternity is like a
[1:37:19] ring
[1:37:20] you can't find no corner to eat
[1:37:24] you can't find no stopping place in the
[1:37:26] perfect
[1:37:27] circle you go on and on
[1:37:30] why not to start right now why not to
[1:37:34] to identify myself my my way of
[1:37:38] believing my confession my my my tongue
[1:37:41] my my expression my song with eternity
[1:37:45] because it's it's going on all the time
[1:37:48] i don't care how far you go you are
[1:37:50] still going
[1:37:52] you can start going around like this
[1:37:55] go through the floor go through the
[1:37:57] earth
[1:37:58] go beyond the earth you are still going
[1:38:02] this is just that you recognize i am
[1:38:04] part of the eighth day
[1:38:06] i am the eighth person i am part of the
[1:38:09] eighth group amen
[1:38:14] praise god hallelujah but the problem is
[1:38:18] uh the problem is that we are living the
[1:38:21] time of the different opinions and the
[1:38:22] people are standing between the two
[1:38:24] opinions
[1:38:24] and if you stand too long between the
[1:38:26] two opinions it causes troubles
[1:38:29] you know because the standing between
[1:38:30] the two opinions is a similar to
[1:38:33] you heard maybe about the bully dance
[1:38:36] donkey
[1:38:37] who heard about the bulldogs donkey
[1:38:41] they are from my church okay
[1:38:44] okay you can go to wikipedia you can
[1:38:46] find it bury dance
[1:38:47] bury dance donkey it was a donkey
[1:38:51] donkey that was standing in the middle
[1:38:53] there was
[1:38:54] a two uh box of the hay on the right
[1:38:58] side and the left side
[1:39:01] food on the right side and left side you
[1:39:04] never heard it
[1:39:05] how it's possible okay you are more
[1:39:07] practical in the states i know that you
[1:39:08] don't go to school too often
[1:39:10] just too long i'm sorry too long they
[1:39:12] are very practical people okay
[1:39:14] i'll explain try to do that quickly but
[1:39:16] you can find the wikipedia easily
[1:39:19] okay so there's a donkey between
[1:39:21] standing
[1:39:22] and just on the right side is a hay and
[1:39:24] on the left side the hay in the same
[1:39:26] uh the same uh length this the same
[1:39:30] uh yeah so close you know and the donkey
[1:39:33] is looking on the right
[1:39:34] looking on the left looking on the right
[1:39:37] and on the left
[1:39:38] and doesn't know how to take decision
[1:39:40] because both sides are
[1:39:42] enough tempting for him to get it but
[1:39:45] you know it's
[1:39:46] if one will be closer you just take a
[1:39:48] bite of this
[1:39:49] and later take a bite of this but
[1:39:52] because the two of them
[1:39:53] they are enough close to the bullet
[1:39:55] dance donkey
[1:39:57] you know he's standing between and
[1:39:59] doesn't know what to do
[1:40:00] only looking like this looking like this
[1:40:03] looking like this and cannot take
[1:40:04] decision
[1:40:06] finally after a certain time you know
[1:40:08] the the the decision
[1:40:10] there is a power decision but you can
[1:40:12] reverse it and it
[1:40:14] overwhelms you and finally the bully
[1:40:17] dance donkey
[1:40:18] losing strength and dying
[1:40:22] after some days dying having excessive
[1:40:24] food
[1:40:25] but he is not able to take decision
[1:40:28] sometimes people they are standing
[1:40:30] between the two
[1:40:31] they say okay the seven one there's also
[1:40:34] something in the seven one
[1:40:35] there's also somebody eight one i don't
[1:40:37] know really
[1:40:39] what to do take from the seventh church
[1:40:42] h
[1:40:42] or maybe from the new church h or just
[1:40:45] uh
[1:40:46] eight h i don't know what to do standing
[1:40:48] between the two opinions
[1:40:50] taking from here or taking from here
[1:40:53] no i don't know some of them they say
[1:40:55] it's better from here
[1:40:56] some of them they say better from here
[1:40:58] so i'm standing i don't know
[1:40:59] i'm looking here i'm looking here i'm
[1:41:01] looking here i'm looking here i'm dying
[1:41:03] here
[1:41:10] don't play a bury dance donkey
[1:41:13] position amen take decision amen there's
[1:41:16] a power of decision
[1:41:17] you will take the right kind of decision
[1:41:19] you will take
[1:41:20] stand for the world you will win
[1:41:23] absolutely
[1:41:24] because we are already in christ
[1:41:27] we only just play something that was
[1:41:29] already made
[1:41:30] in his mind before the foundation of the
[1:41:32] world and he has chosen you
[1:41:34] in christ jesus before the foundation of
[1:41:36] the world and
[1:41:38] he has chosen you to live in that age
[1:41:40] when he is going to unite together
[1:41:43] what is in heaven what is on the earth
[1:41:45] together
[1:41:46] when it will happen in the fullness of
[1:41:49] dispensation
[1:41:52] when the fullness of times has come
[1:41:55] and the dispensation of the change from
[1:41:58] the seventh the eighth
[1:42:00] you are ready to receive it you say lord
[1:42:02] jesus is going beyond my
[1:42:04] understanding but i believe your word i
[1:42:07] believe
[1:42:07] those things because that's in the bible
[1:42:09] the scripture
[1:42:10] from the old testament to the new
[1:42:12] testament jesus who was the eighth
[1:42:14] person david was the eighth person amen
[1:42:17] no i was the eighth person i want to be
[1:42:20] eighth person right now because you open
[1:42:23] the seven seals
[1:42:25] on the eighth day the evening time you
[1:42:27] gave the understanding to me
[1:42:29] something that my brothers and my
[1:42:31] sisters for ages
[1:42:33] they waited for that they pray for that
[1:42:35] they pray for the revival and the
[1:42:37] greatest revival
[1:42:39] but the smallest one but the greatest is
[1:42:41] going on right now
[1:42:43] right now when jesus came the first time
[1:42:46] the eighth person
[1:42:47] it was such a great revival it was so
[1:42:49] small
[1:42:50] a handful of people recognized that what
[1:42:53] do you think
[1:42:54] it was not so mysterious as the second
[1:42:56] coming
[1:42:57] you know when the alpha becoming omega
[1:43:00] amen now i'm going to finish but you
[1:43:03] know the
[1:43:05] octave in latin
[1:43:08] is the eighth octave
[1:43:12] in the musical terminology octave is the
[1:43:15] eighth
[1:43:16] because it's a is a turn whole turn
[1:43:21] from one key up to the eighth one and
[1:43:24] his turn around
[1:43:26] alpha became omega
[1:43:29] we supposed to sing on a higher octave
[1:43:34] we supposed to sing the higher octave
[1:43:35] the new song the seventh song we're
[1:43:38] supposed to understand what's going on
[1:43:40] right now because the main thing
[1:43:41] doesn't go in heaven the main thing is
[1:43:44] going on right now on the earth
[1:43:47] we are the people of the seventh song
[1:43:49] the redeemed ones
[1:43:50] not the heavenly group but i said i'm
[1:43:52] sorry i'm sorry i was mistaken
[1:43:54] holy spirit was present i thought it was
[1:43:56] a heavenly group
[1:43:58] in revelation 5 that sung a new song
[1:44:02] but in the bible you redeem us you
[1:44:04] redeem us you made us
[1:44:06] kings and priests the new song is sung
[1:44:09] here the octave turn
[1:44:12] amen octave the eighth
[1:44:16] hallelujah we are the eight people
[1:44:19] amen we came from eternity coming back
[1:44:22] to eternity
[1:44:23] praise god you love him he's so precious
[1:44:27] to us god bless you
[1:44:29] god bless you let's stand up amen
[1:44:38] hallelujah let's bow our heads
[1:44:42] lord jesus we are so thankful
[1:44:45] again coming before
[1:44:49] your face knowing that you loved us so
[1:44:52] much before the foundation of the world
[1:44:54] and you made it possible for us
[1:44:58] to come in this age i'm so thankful
[1:45:01] father
[1:45:02] you even created the earth because of us
[1:45:05] and you place us here we are here gather
[1:45:07] in thy name
[1:45:09] father we know that the the bride must
[1:45:11] be drawn together
[1:45:13] the bride must be taken up in the midst
[1:45:15] of the seventh seal
[1:45:16] the mystery of going father we believe
[1:45:19] that we are living in that season
[1:45:21] open our eyes lord let us be honest in
[1:45:24] our hearts
[1:45:25] to see scripture how is fulfilling on
[1:45:28] our eyes how the word of god is real
[1:45:31] genuine how we didn't come to certain
[1:45:34] station
[1:45:34] between but we came to a reality genuine
[1:45:39] genuine feast genuine uniting time
[1:45:42] and sign genuine word that became flesh
[1:45:45] in the bride
[1:45:46] father we've been in your mind before
[1:45:48] the foundation of the world
[1:45:49] but it's such a privilege to worship you
[1:45:51] in our flesh
[1:45:53] knowing that we've been sinful born in a
[1:45:55] wrong way
[1:45:56] oh father we came through the wrong
[1:45:58] channel but now we've got a different
[1:46:00] birth
[1:46:01] we are born by this power of a spoken
[1:46:03] word we've got the immaculate birth
[1:46:06] you had it you've been the only one only
[1:46:08] one
[1:46:09] you just came not through sex but now
[1:46:11] you provide a way for
[1:46:12] us that we've got the birth by the power
[1:46:15] spoken word
[1:46:16] father not by sex we've got a different
[1:46:18] birth
[1:46:19] and we learn how to walk in that flesh
[1:46:22] that is not right this flesh must be
[1:46:24] changed but we are walking by faith in
[1:46:27] the reality of the new concept
[1:46:29] and understanding of the eighth day and
[1:46:32] we are so thankful
[1:46:33] father this morning bless your people i
[1:46:36] pray father flow through us
[1:46:38] may your spirit have a freedom in our
[1:46:39] lives because we know that we are when

[1:46:44] spirit can flow through us
[1:46:46] then we are becoming the living
[1:46:48] manifested

[1:47:16] family of god that is united
[1:47:18] cannot be separated this marriage cannot
[1:47:21] be separated
[1:47:22] is uniting time and sign all that was in
[1:47:25] heaven
[1:47:25] all that is on the earth is united
[1:47:27] together in the fullness of times
[1:47:30] when the last seven church h came to the
[1:47:33] end
[1:47:33] and you open the door in heaven
[1:47:36] thank you jesus in the name of jesus
[1:47:39] christ we give you praise and honor
[1:47:41] amen amen god bless you
[1:47:45] my brothers and my sisters it was a
[1:47:46] privilege absolutely privileged for me
[1:47:48] to stand here
[1:47:50] if you didn't understand everything
[1:47:52] sorry for my english
[1:47:54] sorry for if something was not spoken
[1:47:56] properly but i know
[1:47:58] the holy spirit was here to help you and
[1:48:01] make it right
[1:48:03] broken words you know uh something
[1:48:06] simple
[1:48:07] but the holy spirit is here we depend on
[1:48:09] him i depend on him but i know that the
[1:48:11] holy spirit is here behind the pulpit
[1:48:13] is also there in the congregation amen
[1:48:15] amen
[1:48:16] god bless you tell me again
[1:48:32] know what i like the title people of the
[1:48:34] eighth day
[1:48:36] it's got to go beyond the understanding
[1:48:38] of the eighth day the doctrine of the
[1:48:40] eighth day the teaching of the eighth
[1:48:41] day
[1:48:42] but there's got to be a people of the
[1:48:43] eighth day
[1:48:45] living by an eighth day revelation not
[1:48:47] by a seventh day revelation
[1:48:49] i want to have more than an
[1:48:50] understanding that it's an eighth day
[1:48:52] that were caught up beyond out of the
[1:48:54] pentecostal age into the bride age
[1:48:56] i wanted to be more than knowledge more
[1:48:58] than understanding i want it to be a
[1:49:00] life
[1:49:01] how many want to be people of the eighth
[1:49:03] day with eight day revelation living an
[1:49:05] eighth day life
[1:49:06] every day amen stuck in time but
[1:49:09] eternity
[1:49:10] fleshed out in a time realm the eighth
[1:49:13] day
[1:49:14] made manifest in the seventh day because
[1:49:17] the two are together blending from one
[1:49:19] into the other
[1:49:20] it's an overlap time do you believe in
[1:49:22] your overlap time
[1:49:23] then it's time and the overlap time for
[1:49:25] eternity to be manifest in time
[1:49:30] i want to be people of the eighth day
[1:49:33] not
[1:49:33] knowledge not a concept not a doctrine
[1:49:36] but a
[1:49:36] living reality lived in flesh
[1:49:39] let it be lived in me o god oh i
[1:49:43] appreciated the word how many love the
[1:49:44] lord for the word
