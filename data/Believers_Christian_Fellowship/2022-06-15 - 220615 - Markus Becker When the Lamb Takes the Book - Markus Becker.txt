god and heavenly father it's a wonderful time together even on that wednesday evening you know that good atmosphere that we feel father that may you just continue to keep that atmosphere during the preaching of the word father when you just let me deliver the thought that you put on my heart's father may you prepare the hearts to receive the word because he sent his word and made them well father heavenly father we thank you for this moment if there was anything in this week that was mispleasing to you father please we ask for forgiveness play it under your blood further and ask for the for your grace and mercy that will come with boldness in your presence heavenly father may you bless your brides here in ohio father wherever they are may you bless israel father because those who is blessed israel they are blessed father so we ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you all while we're standing let's open the word of the lord and thank you for the musicians that is just wonderful amen we read in genesis and um in genesis chapter 41 verse 50 genesis 41 verse 15. and it reads like this and unto joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came which asanat the daughter of putiforth priest of on bear unto him and joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh for god said he had hath had me forget all my toils in all my father's house so tremendous there is in the old testament there was already a way to forget all the frustrations in life that's tremendous and let us read in the book of revelation in revelation chapter 5 verse 7. revelations chapter 5 verse 7 and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that said upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of orders which are the prayer of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and open the seals thereof i mean you maybe see that may the lord add his blessing to the reading of his word so it's just wonderful to be here and it's a great honor for me after after these services over there i think it was october or november to be back in your place and as the pastor was saying already i'm here for just coming from canada from a youth weekend it seems that i even i would be 80 years old and still have the reputation to be a youth preacher somehow it's i'm always invited to use meetings brother mark would you make some youth meetings and and okay that's how it is whatever we can do to serve the lord and um as brother chap was saying i said look i'm in the area and i would not be around just to tell you my good old friend and and precious brother and he said look why don't you take over a wednesday service and it's a great honor for me so i'm i'm greeting bringing the greetings of brother gert and the church in bristolsburg and they will feel very much connected with you and at the same time certainly our sister sibila she is sending all greetings to all of you right and um blessed be the name of the lord thank you brother chad for the great honor to be here for the great privilege and uh it's always my joy i always feel a little bit at home here in germany we have a saying which says feel at home but don't behave like this don't put the feet on the table and i'm always aware wherever i'm traveling i'm behind another man's pulpit and we always should respect another men's houses and other men's churches another men's pulpit that's i think it's we learned this a little bit in life huh and um for this evening i um i have a wonderful thought huh uh we have a we have a weak preacher but we have a great big message you know it's really i would like to call it when the lamb takes the book and uh look this is not a teaching you know this is a wednesday evening service this is not a serious please keep in mind it it will not be the full picture it will not be the balance in all things please do not expect but but i have just a point um of explaining to us what the opening of these seals means for us for our life for for our everyday life for our behavior for our vision for our time okay so there's a lot of aspects and and and which goes along with this and um i would like to put it into the story of uh of of joseph because brother branham puts the fifth seal he puts it in the story of joseph so again it's not the full picture it's every not everything is in balance it's just to to lay a ground for the inspiration that we have for this for this day and so what we have let me just read um out of out of the scripture and it says look at this when joseph was revealing himself he said joseph said unto his brethren i'm joseph does my father yet live and his brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence and joseph said unto his brethren come near to me i pray you and they came near and he said i am joseph your brother whom you sold into egypt now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that you have sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life now that is somebody who understands his life and once we understand our life we become a blessing to others if not we always have to live with our frustration with our hatred with our complexes with our stories what everybody did to us and as i always said the the rapture will not be for a frustrated group the rapture will not be for a spiritual teenager the rapture will be for a group who clearly understood who they were on this earth the rapture for us will not be a denominational thing of of of santa claus coming in fact we are already in the process you see god is already transforming us we're already leaving loud is here coming up higher and higher from revelation to revelation and it will not be a doctrinal thing it will be an understanding of ourselves through the scriptures in the scriptures but it will change our life definitely so we find ourselves we stop running around ourselves okay that is tremendous so so so you keep in mind that that's tremendous unbelievable and so okay so we understand that that let's let's tell a little bit the story of joseph and you have to click into this so when joseph was born he was born with a gift joseph didn't ask to have a gift joseph was born with a purpose joseph was born with a destiny he should take over the kingdom so the bride is born with part of god in him in herself because david said in the psalms he said he even put eternity in our hearts there is only one who is eternal that's god so when you came onto on on this earth nobody asked you do you want to be an american nobody asked you anyhow if you're an american you're nothing else in a backslidden european anyhow okay okay so nobody asks you do you want to be black or white nobody asked you nobody asked you do you want to be female or male nobody asked do you want to live in arizona or in ohio nobody asked you about your family background you were just thrown into it you couldn't even choose your own name your father and your mother choose your name if you like it or not you have it you should come on this earth uh by by the spoken words but you came through the birth channel with all the blood and all the cryings and all what goes along with this huh i was there when my border was born born and i always said this my wife needed one nurse to help her i needed to [Laughter] that was too much for me that was too much for me that disaster that was real master of disaster and that was really that was really unbelievable and and you see we came on this earth the first thing that we got was a spanky and the midwife said you will get more during your life that was the beginning that was the welcoming service okay you you thought of of of here is somebody taking your arms in his arms and you got a spanky and the midwife said okay welcome you get more of it okay so so we never choose our life and we never choose how we came and we never choose the age in which we wanted to live but one thing is sure no matter i always make that little picture when it comes to our life this is just an illustration about the beckett gave many many years ago he said god made a picture of his whole family right and we were right there exactly so it's just an illustration and god took our lives and he was thrown in seven church ages over seven continents and he put part of himself in into us and when the seven church ages are over god knows one thing my sheep hear my voice so all of the family of god will be there nobody is missing because god put part of himself into us so so even the brother brahman said god without you is not complete anymore that means something the messenger of this age he could look farther than anybody else in the bible moses could only say in the beginning god created john could only say in the beginning god that was there was the logos coming out of god but this messenger could look farther than anybody else and god knew one thing we would need it in order to go into the rapture the rapture is a revelation not in knowledge is a revelation so joseph he was born if he liked it or not and you must understand you had that if you a bride you had that calling in you if you liked it or not you were always different than the rest you tried to be some like some someone in the world we tried everything to be like the world to to close like the world to dance like the world i remember that i could i could dance like michael jackson i could make the moon walk so i will not show okay that's fine don't don't fear no fear but but but we tried to be as but we were not and and and and the proof was when god called us there was something in us to respond we did not understand the message in the beginning not at all we didn't even understand brother brandon we only f we only thought it sounds good you see but it was during the message of the hour we were developing ourself god was taking the amnesia from our eyes that today we know we are more than just sinners saved by grace but we are family of god and we go back to where we came from nobody stands in our way but but god allowed many heartaches many difficulties to bring us to the point that we are so when joseph was a young boy he was already a prophet or let me call it he was already a patriarch i always call him a prophet hope that i'm right in this joseph was different because god always revealed himself as the god of abraham jacob and isaac that's all never as the god of joseph joseph brought a change of dispensation completely you cannot compare him because he stands for for perfection he was the one portraying christ because he was marrying aznat okay so i called him prophet in in my own in my in my own thinking okay um that's exactly so but he is he was one of the patriarchs one of the foundation for original parts okay so what happened is he has a dream and uh now exactly this now he tells his brother his dream now what we what what what we learned in life is i have a little problem with no problem just give me a second what we learned in life is when we came into the message of the hour we were full of energy we were full of enthusiasm and we were full of naivety exactly so we learned our lessons that we should talk when it's time to talk that we should know to whom do we talk that we should know how to listen and to be silent when it's better to be silent okay and but joseph was a young boy and he meant well he had good he had good intentions but he told his brothers very sincere uh look brothers i had a dream and the dream was just fantastic you're all bowing before me so it was clear that the older brothers were not very amused about that kind of a dream and and uh he meant well but i always tell our young people he said there is some kind like a persecution which lays in our destiny because christ in us will be persecuted anyhow but you can bring persecution by our own mistakes we can't break we can bring persecution to ourselves okay we we don't have homeschooling in germany i always tell the young people don't discuss with the teacher don't try to evangelize the whole school because you will just bring reproach and and and persecution upon also yourself if somebody asked just say we have a church sunday morning a service come and see okay but we're not called to convince the the teacher and religion uh to convert the world we are we are taught we are we're called to say something when god wants to say something okay when we were younger we thought we had to evangelize everyone and if somebody didn't want we want to evangelize by force and if it didn't work we were frustrated about somebody who was not worthy that we were talking but he was not asked to talk to us anyhow we were not invited to talk but we wanted to convince sohart and then the frustration was over and then uh all the frustrations started so joseph was a young boy and he meant well but he didn't do well to mean well and to do well is to different things okay to mean well and to do well is different so what happened as he was portraying christ he was sent on the field to search his brothers that reminds us to david he had a calling in his life and he was sent out to to find out his brothers that is you if you are a christian you go out to find your brother you're not just evangelizing everyone but you find you try to find your brother amen without abusing another people's another man's emotion another man's conviction another man's religion but you try to find your brothers okay i believe you have the same opinion like us we're not interested in just filling up the church we're interested in finding eagles amen not all just filling up churches but finding eagles i'm a people who are really have a predestination in their heart so here's what brother branham says in the breach he said but you see the sleeping virgin ain't receive nothing anyhow that's right and remember while they went to try to buy oily remember the scripture doesn't say they got it but while they were out trying to buy their camera sound what happened all those virgins that slept rose and trimmed their lamps and went into the supper is that right and the rest was left for the tribulation tribulation period right weeping wailing and gnashing of tears that's the church not the bride the church the bride went in and here's what brother blame says he said there is a whole difference between the church and the bride that's a big difference because the bride is entering into the wedding supper and in order to enter into the wedding supper she must have a garment because according to the parable of jesus if you have no garment you cannot enter that garment is your theophany therefore the bride has a theophany everybody who dies he would they will go into some kind of a body because he must be judged but as theophany is more than a spiritual body a theophany is part of god coming out of god only the bride have it now for the jews they will be given white robes brother blame said we have them already there's a big difference therefore laodicea is blind and they are naked naked on this side of that of the dimension and they are naked on the other side they are naked here because they have a reflection they are naked on the other hand side they don't have a they might be safe nothing against that but they don't have a a a theophany they're not part of the bride so they are naked there and they are naked here there's a big difference between a church and a bride look what happened when joseph was sent out by his brothers and he was just sold and and they brought that kind of clothes with the blood on it for his father it was not joseph's blood we understand but it represented so i want you to put on the spiritual jacket when joseph uh later revealed himself to his brothers the brothers came and went to their father jacob and said joseph lives the father said but i have his garment of blood but they said but joseph lives and he said but i have his garment of blood it's here now the blood of jesus christ is precious it's very precious it's extremely precious but there are things that are more precious than the blood of jesus christ that's christ himself christ is more precious than his blood is that correct the giver is higher than the gift amen brother brahm even said the purchase of the blood is higher or more precious than the blood itself so so while the father was still in denominational thinking but i have his blood i have everything now the person said but he is risen he's here forget about that garment he is here the person is here they say amen the blood of jesus christ is precious nobody will diminish that but the person is even greater than his own blood can you say amen so that's so important to see that we see the young boy that that that that that there was a changing of egypt the changing of dispensation so when joseph was sold to egypt the bible says he was 17 years old and he was 30 years old when he came in the presence of the king now we see that this message is reflecting or the bible is reflecting what god is doing in this message i mean because we live in the time of the perfection i would call it joseph time but this is not a this is not even a brother branham's terminology but we remember that the life of a prophet is a message in itself okay mo noah was not only building not only was preaching an ark but the fact that he was building was the message for the people so god says to brother brandon you will have a son and you call him joseph and people because it's a sign this is the time of perfection this is changing of dispensation this is when when when the shadow becomes the reality definitely so definitely so now this message did not diminish calvary but it puts it right in its right place this message did not diminish the holy spirit but it put it right in the right place because elijah will put everything in its right place this message stops with lutheran thinking about the jews because luther had no idea who the jews were in the plan of god this messenger brought forth the the thoughts from the back part of god's mind can you say amen and we see ourselves in the picture so we see that brother branham that the pillar of fire arrived on the ohio river 1933 and 17 years later it arrived there in houston exactly and 13 years later i'm a seven angel appeared like in the life of joe 17 after 13 years he was introduced to the king now 1950 1963 seven angel appear who king the king the words the light shalom good morning church the night is over loud is here so we're still living loud he's here that's fine but the bride is not spiritually loud he's here no good morning church he is here hallelujah christ the word we're still waiting for him to meet him we can say in the air i always say it's a changing of dimension but we're not fast we let's make it like this we go all go into the rapture and then we'll see how it was okay what's the changing of dimension what is it what the fine definitely so but it's a special time okay when the king is here i mean the message of today is not god send a prophet in all respect it is the king is here the word is here as as as the star over there and the three stars never let the three young men the three wise men never let themselves to jerusalem or to to themselves the star was leading them to king to christ which is the king now we have seen his star in our generation the seventh star which was william branham and he was not leading us to branham tabernacle he led us to christ which is the king can you say amen definitely so so so certainly we are one of these three of the of of of these three uh let me say these three wise men coming down from from from mesopotamia area right so we see that uh brother blame said it like this now i want you to watch real close in the fifth seal they were given robes they didn't have them said brother brain they were given ropes white robes each one of them now the saints already have one they get it here but there they were given ropes and the saints already had theirs and gone on see that's a big difference they were given ropes by by gods by god's glory hammond now watch ideas now god brings your life in turbulences because he wants to bring you to a certain point of understanding god allows that your life is not a picnic it's not intended to be a picnic and sometimes let me say i'm you understand i'm sometimes missing the right words but something we have to forgive god i mean because he's throwing us in situation that we did not search to be in i mean but but god is the one who brings us out and whenever we go through such a dramatic situation we come out fortified we come out more mature more to be a real christian definitely so so he did he he does it with all his people and he did it with joseph joseph never knew that one day he would be in the bible joseph didn't say uh friends i want to become popular please throw me into the ditch and sell me to egypt please do so i would like to be a character joseph joseph wanted to stay with his family it was not joseph's choosing his disaster it was god's choosing it was god's way and and and and for joseph it was nothing else than a trauma you you can understand that a young brother expect of his older brothers to protect him you see and but but here were these men with their wicked plan and brother brahm said it was just it was it was it was not a pure envy it was how do you call it uh not pure envy it was just a dirty envy that's how he says it of his brothers because of the gift of the young one and the young boy of his family 17 years old he is expecting his brothers to protect him to understand him to help him and they're just just telling him you never know he didn't know where to go he could be just on a slave market to be uh you could imagine what a slave could do not only working let's go a little bit your imagination what could happen to joseph you see on a slave market you know he could end up in something that we will not mention here behind the pulpit he did not know and he was just he was just shouting reuben you cannot do this judah help me and they were just saying goodbye so there was a there was a traumatic situation in the boy's life i can imagine that while he was in asnap's home or in potiphar's home and while he was in the uh in in the prison he was he was yelling he said my god my god why have you forsaken me and god all the time he knew boy i will reveal myself to you the bible doesn't say when god revealed himself to joseph but be sure joseph was not christ that at the age of 12 he knew all things um he did not understand his life but god had a mystery laid into his heart and somewhere on the way god must have revealed to him because god joseph could tell his brothers brothers look god sent me here it wasn't you it was god the bible doesn't say when and how but somehow god revealed his plan to him brother if god does it for our life we come in peace with ourselves we come in peace with our enemies because you know one thing there's nothing in my life that god didn't allow i'm not i'm i'm not an object of any kind of wind i'm in the hands of my father and brother blame said this quote brother branham god is behind every move every move that comes to my life my father allowed it he has a deeper plan into it i mean deaf can you say amen but it was a trauma for him and i thought by myself now if there was enough virtue in the old testament to heal a young man's heart how much more with the baptism of the holy spirit and how much more was this message changing us from the inside to the outside brother we tried everything to make new creatures in the church we tried reformation it never worked we tried pentecostalism it never worked we tried to work on outside people that the dress becomes longer and longer and longer but and i'm 100 for it but a long dress will not make you happy that's the other side god wants you to be happy in christ and the long dress is the is the fruits of your connection with god because you want to please your father so so real gospel is not working on the outside of people to make them shine to be good believers real gospel is the operation on the soul of a person because a dove is cleaning itself from the inside to the outside can you say amen i believe one thing i saw how this message changed people look you have always people who come and try to to to steal away your faith let me say you were believer in christ or you gave your heart to the lord as a young person we go to the streets and we make some kind like evangelizations and you have always a critic and the critic comes and he says look that thing with christianity and jesus i mean it's just fake it's just religion there's nothing behind it and then at a certain moment you say hey brother honestly you come too late honestly you come too late because i saw how god changed my life you come too late there's no discussion because i know what it did for me and and and remember that's something when people say yes and uh brother brother marcus i mean in the vision of brother branham did 13 people fell from that bridge of 14 people fell from that bridge i said brother i wasn't there it doesn't interest me honestly but i know what this message did to my heart you have to understand it changed from the messenger to the message we're not talking about william branham as a man when the seals were open brother branham never preached any more of my life story that was over he preached last time 59 or 16 in i think it was an angular's temple over there in los angeles when the seals were open brother bryan because eliezer now had done his work and here are greater than eliezers there brother never preached his life story after the opening of the seal because now the man william branham was not anymore so important it went from the prophet to the prophecy it went from the messenger to the message so somebody wants to discuss with me what are 13 people on that bridge of 14 i said honestly brother uh i wasn't there i will never be there that's fine let history be history but i know what this word did in my life somebody wants to discuss i think honestly uh i cannot prove it if there were 30 or 14 but i can't prove you one thing you come too late you come too late for me honestly if this message has nothing to say to you this is respected hey give me five that's fine but this message means everything for me because it's my father talking to me it was brother ben's voice if there was a voice behind that voice can you say amen but you see now here is the prophet and this message is the it gives a healing part for our frustrated life because god throwed us into this into this tornado and god is the one speaking to the storm here are many people they come they were long in a false doctrine some kind in a false doctrine he said brother marcus it was so pitiful that i was so long in a false doctrine no it was god allowing for you to be there it shaped you and god had the right moment to take you out god did not come too late it was part of your shapening can you say amen never regret your past my father knew what he did can you say amen this would be the name of the lord so here comes the woman to brother branham and she is not at all she is so nervous and brother brennan prays and she becomes more and more nervous brother ryan preaches the message do you believe she said she had all different people come anoint her in her oil pray for her stomp devils and kick devils and everything else but he stayed right there i said he the devil will stay right there as long as you've got that unconfessed sin in that case it was sin but okay she said brother branham i confessed it to god i said it wasn't god yet you sinned against it was your husband you make that right oh it will break up my home and so forth okay then she said this she said i don't even think of that brother brain said no you don't but your subconscious is thinking of death all the time i mean now let's see one minute in the prayer line of the chicago syria and we understand that we're not talking about psychology we we preach or we show something that this messenger showed to us how we have a conscious and how we have a subconscious in in that story of that woman it was unconfessed sin but it can be a traumatic it can be wounds it can be frustrations and we think we forgot them yes we forgot them but our subconscious is still priced to god we have a very nice uh when it comes to traumatic things or are our uh uh hurted feelings hurted situations uh things where we where we cannot forgive us uh things where we cannot forgive others i want i love that brother but we will never forget it you see it's something that is deeper than just trying to do something god has to make an operation amen if not we become frustrated nice church members but god cannot use it god wants to heal us so that we can go into this rapture without no die no depths no depth i owe anything to anybody and sure nobody owes anything to me everything is really under the blood look brother we have a nice slogan which does not function the nice slogan is this if somebody has something deep in his heart it's it's it's uh oh uh you just forget it and uh uh we put it in the sea of forgetfulness and then we put him just a nice sign fishing forbidden and every ha ha wonderful fishing phobia that's a nice thing but it does not work because everything that is in your subconscious conscious does not know time there's no time it must be dealt by the holy spirit it's an operation it has to be done if not we become just miserable people who cannot forgive ourselves who cannot be forgive others it's the door to to a religious spirit to a judgmental spirit to a to a comparing spirit huh me my family your family look how we are a little bit better than the rest and yeah we want to be happy christian can you say amen i mean look how brother brandon helps that sister brother franco is that fine for you and only this message could explain these things to us here we go all right excuse me sister i have to relax my mind once in a moment now we will be strangers i see that you are strictly a stranger to me look where she starts crying you come from another city you've got a lot of trouble on your heart you got hard trouble to begin with is that right there's a whole lot of blackness i see a black sheep keep following you like that oh it's alive somebody's stole the line and that was a man was professing divine healing he said you was a witch is that true and you've got a whole stir in your church or something about it in that right your pastor's sick right now he's got polio is that right sister don't pay no attention to what them people tell you there are lies and the only things wrong with your hearts that nervous condition got your heart worked up go on home in peace and god bless you you're all right praise be to god look look the the subconscious that we have is like a big container we are filling these subconscious up with all kind of experiences that we make in our life you remember that brother branham says he was at the doctor and the doctor says look you're a strange man because you're subconscious and your conscience is so close that you can see a dream without sleeping is that correct am i therefore it exists it's not psychology it's part of of a makeup of a human being so it's in a hard person in a person's heart we are not preaching about it because i many times preach about the healing through the third pull you see but all kind of even traumatic situation will be inherited through the genes to the next generation the the somebody got a nobel prize for it in the beginning of epigenetic uh inheritances definitely so traumatic city are from the holocaust from situ different different situations for the next generation that is so important now look that woman comes now to the prophet and she does not know what's wrong with her now brother rem said you have a heart problems problem okay look if brother brennan would be a pentecostal preacher okay she would went to him he would see how she is nervous and he would say oh that's the devil that's the devil that's the devil so let the brothers come let make the open old-fashioned prayer lines where all the brothers come together everybody lays hands and and and and that is fine but i believe we are a little bit more far advanced than that kind of a thing i believe that old jewish tradition is fine it's not wrong it's okay but i think we should be a little bit farther on the way amen to take god by his words because honestly i come from germany but i'm not santa claus okay but i have something if you believe it that heals you right on you on your spot amen you don't need my hands to be to be healed to be honest okay that's fine so here is a pentecostal preacher and he says now to that woman look you are so nervous and they're telling your church that you're just a witch that is nobody else than satan you see he will he will try to cast out the devil out of that woman but there the problem is there is no devil in her brother blames first said sister then he says there's nothing wrong with you that's what he says just your nervous condition but if i don't have the true discernment i would say satan come out of that sister stop bothering her you see now first the sister's not helped because she has no satan she has no the prophet said i have all this fine with you i mean so you cannot cast out the devil raise no devil but she has a trauma and which is deep in her soul and here is the prophet it's deep in her in her subconscious and remember the five entrances to the spirit one is conscious ah got it it's there it's part of our life don't try to override it don't try to make a fig leaf and say all is well let's sing a song about it many things has to be treated in order to go into a better future and say lord this hurted me come with your barn from gilead and heal that situation therefore every service that we have is a therapy today we have group therapy they say amen therefore we cannot sleep in the church because every service the holy spirit wants to work on us do something step by step amen so what happens is this now first the sister is not helped second she will go back to her place and thinks i have a devil because the preacher told me so she will never become happy anymore for the rest of her life it's finished brother we cannot play brother branham we cannot play that game because we are playing with the feelings of people and the best is in if they believe us as ministers amen they they will ne they will come to totally into a dead end they say amen we're not brother brandon we must be honest with one another amen but god can't give us a certain leadership what help but what happens is this now it lays in her spirit subconscious somewhere and i do not say that that she will be happy from the next day on because she still had to have reputation in the church to be a witch but i mean if i believed that brother brennan was the prophet of the hour and he would tell me marcus nothing is wrong with me i would believe it and this confession will change me i will not look any more on my symptoms i would look on the spoken word he said he knows because he can see in the other dimension you remember when we were shown the couch potato the one the one who doesn't come from his couch what did brother branham do he he said quickening power brought me behind the curtain of time and i've seen all of you there that makes the couch potato to stand up and say i i know i'm gonna make it i don't know how i don't know when i don't know how fast but i know one thing there is already my positive attribute waiting already so with brother brandon brought us something that no other messenger could give us i believe now that is marcus paul said i'm not boasting this man but i was boasting about the man that i saw amen in the third in my own words okay now who did he saw i believe he saw his own theophany that is marcus i see people see a different but that's me i don't make a doctrine but but this messenger did not only see himself behind the curtain of time but he brought us all together behind the curtain of time and oh you want one thing i make it i make it the church says i don't make it my body says i don't make it my complex it says i don't make it but the prophet must have seen me there so i don't believe my circumstances i look to your holy temple like solomon did can you say amen and now i don't have to hide my life and and and try to to at least if somebody has a trauma the thing is he would always avoid to go around that thing because it hurt the trauma is a wound it's a greek word for a wound in our soul okay abuse church abuse child abuse all these things even a minister can abuse people you see i mean that is so so we have to pay attention to really uh help today i mean when when i was younger i mean we were problem orientated we we could show all the problem in the church today we are solution orientated you must show a way you must so everybody must come out of because gospel is good news we will not change gospel is good news i mean god sometimes shows the problem but he must the holy spirit will always give a way out somebody says brother marcus my situation i have no way i tell you once that jesus is the way and if jesus is the way you have a way there's no dead end for your life he is the way i don't know how i don't know when i don't know what he's doing i don't know what minister comes i don't know how he uses the pastor i don't know who he uses but you have a way because jesus is the way can you say amen so god did this for the young man now joseph was a tremendous man and he had a great advantage in his own life because he was in brother brian's sunday school definitely so we will we will just prove it how he was in brother brian's sunday school yes here we go whatever you put brother you we're missing young people there in the world and the discotheque this evening but what they need is an intercessor what they need is someone who reaches a hand down to them someone who is a friend to them we're not a cult we're not a sect in a sect you are only have a value when you come to church the moment you leave the church you're nobody anymore nobody's greeting you anymore i mean that's a sect we're not a sect we're a church we're family and the family we cannot only think oh i'm glad the family of god this is blah blah because when problems comes god wants to see if we are family or if we sing blah blah and the most and god allows that people fall so deep we live in a little city a little village the young people who go into the world i mean they come with blue hair same village of thousand people here comes an older sister he says he's a brother marcus have you seen that sister that little girl a teenager she has now blue hair i said yes she has blue hair because she needs christ therefore she has blue hair and who is the one giving christ that's you not the protestant church we give christ to them if we don't reach a hand to them we're not agreeing at all with their lifestyle but we reach a hand and said look we're family okay amen not agreeing no centimeter sometimes young people go into the world and and and uh i i always keep in touch with them it's the truth what i say i'm not exaggerating so i'm interested in them not in a religious way but in a friendly way so i'm texting them what's up i said how are you doing they said brother marcus i wasn't in church on sunday i said that's fine look i'm over 50 i understand i'm over 50 but i'm not as old that i wouldn't see who's in the church or not thank you for reminding me it's truly appreciated amen then i'm writing how are you doing brother marcus i will come next week i mean that's that's a lie anyhow if if somebody says i will come he doesn't come if someone succumbed he shows up then he's there i mean but i said look this is not my question i think you have a minister's complex that if a minister writes you a whatsapp the only question that he has in life where were you on sunday i'm interested in your soul how are you doing man can i help you how help yeah can i pray can we do something for you is there something to make life easier for you but i don't come to church i know but we are family and we are friends and i believe there's still something in you that god will call so why should i let you i will not help the person by letting somebody down can you say amen so here it is what happens yeah that way before i spoke about this brian i mean you bring me out of the concept brother brian that's exactly so why now joseph was completely alone he was not in the church he was not among his family but he never forgets what he learned in brother brian's sunday school he said because they had two dreams and he was in the prison and they said unto him we have dreamed a dream and there is no interpreter of it and joseph said unto them do not interpretations belong to god tell me them joseph was the only one in egypt believing in one god because all egypt believed in gods jesus and oziris anubis joseph didn't say the gods but he was in brian sunday school he said look wherever you are but don't forget you have a father don't forget you have an eye that is watching you um you might go here and you might go but don't forget there is there is an agent which is the holy spirit who tries to bring you back one day the thing that we saw in the heart as a seed in our children you must have faith in it god doesn't come too late we're not entertaining the young people we are throwing seed into their hearts to know that one day our arms will be too short but god's arm will never be too short and we had a tremendous messenger whose son saw the angel of the lord and he had his special round of honor and brother and billy paul said i did everything which was on the calendar seeing the angel of the lord and you could see how brother branham he has a separation over it he doesn't become nervous he doesn't think about his model family and what will this say what will dad say i mean he knows one thing a calling is a supernatural act from god god must call a person and sometimes people have to have a certain way we don't encourage them but don't give up if they don't go the way that you think because god will not come too late i remember that billy paul gave the testimony he he did not he did not uh uh he did not say that he will come to bran and tabana he just came as a as a visitor one day and brother brain was preaching about the prodigal son and he was his own son sitting there and he said and and and he said the next day uh my father and me we went fishing you see if people are in a difficult situation they don't want to talk they invite avoid to talk okay people made it like this he said like this my father was standing there and i was standing here and whenever my father went a step in my direction i went a step in the other direction he said at the end of the day we went one tour around the lake you see amen but god allows that we're never ashamed of our kids because i cannot see that brother branham is ashamed of his family though if you see things it was not everything perfect perfect perfect but these youngsters they need a friend amen can you say amen now i believe i came to the lord when i was 20 21 and i did all kind of nonsense that there is but i believe one thing my father was never ashamed of me because my father said my boy doesn't know who he is but let me call him with a supernatural calling let me call him and then his time is over i heard the voice of god audible in a discotheque this is not your place thank god for this but i have to understand our youngsters you don't have to go into the world do you see to come out of the world into the into christianity is a test as a wonderful testimony it's tremendous unbelievable but having a testimony that having a testimony that you never went into the world is much bigger it's much greater it i pull off my head as i said in toronto to use me i pull off my head for every sister who keeps herself clean until the altar i put off my head this is a great respect and this time and i will live my full respect for your attitude god will bless it don't play around amen if something happened don't give up neither but fight to keep yourself clean before the lord and you say amen so this was the situation they as as as as as far as joseph was from his church from his family from his situation the brothers must have forsaken him father must have forgotten him the neighbors they were just murmuring about him but there was still something in the heart of joseph that never left him that was god's presence i believe that god went with that boy into the prison amen god was just protecting him because he knew one thing joseph when you get older there's a work for you to do maybe you are old already but be sure you're becoming older and for all of us there's a great work to do to go into the rapture there's a great thing that god is right now doing amen god is working our hearts so the revealing part comes and we see that joseph reveals himself to his brothers and god is uh god is orchestrating all these things together look at this here's what brother brahem says in the 15 and i want you to put on the spiritual jacket he says jesus gives them robes like joseph did to his brothers i mean the bible never said they got ropes it must be supernatural amen look when joseph stood there and when he finally he made himself known there by the altar his own altar in his place his throne he said everybody leave me so he reveals himself at his altar his palace his throne he's speaking hebrew now i am your brother joseph said wait a minute okay make a stop an altar a throne is a place where judgment is pronounced or where verdict is said it's a great place of judgment a king who sits down now starts with his judgment when he stands up the verdict is said it's spoken out amen the trial is over when the king sits down on his throne and brother abraham said joseph at his throne at his altar amen in his house amen so whenever a king sits down on a throne it's time for trial for judgment now the bible says this and you now we keep in mind when the lamb takes the book of the one who is sitting on the throne and the great thing that we learned for the messy of the hour it's the same person we don't believe in that trinity it's the same person but it's the changing of time amen so when a king sits down or a monarch or a potentate the bible says john 19 when pilate therefore heard that saying he brought jesus force set down in the judgment seat in the place that is called the pavement but in hebrew gabata so pilate sat down and the trial began when he was sat down on the judgment seat his wife sent unto him saying have thou nothing to do with that just man for i have suffered many things in day in a dream because of him exodus and it came to pass that at midnight the lord spoke all the firstborn in the land of egypt from the first born of pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captives exodus and it came to pass on the moral you put on your spiritual jacket that moses said to judge the people and the people stood by moses from the morning until the evening exodus 18 13 in other words in the evening he stood up judgment was over trial was over amen ruth then when boris up then went boaz up to the gates set him down there and behold the kinsmen of whom boa spake came by unto whom he said oh such such a one turn of sound turn aside sit down here and he turned aside and sat down what was done at judgment at trial amen not to condemn but give back inheritance amen mark and jesus said over against the treasury and behold and beheld how the people cast many into the treasury and many that were rich cast in much what happened the judgment the trial comes for that little woman jesus said she gave more than all the rest of them and i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received the mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years judgment was given and they sat down esther now it came to pass on the third day that esther put on her royal apparel stood in the inner court and the king's house over against the king's house and the king sat upon his royal throne amen giving that that granted that grace to esther and above the firmament ezekiel over their heads the likeness of a throne as the appearance of safer stone upon the likeness of a throne and likeness is the appearance of a man upon it right okay look yeah put on a spiritual jacket when a man when a king sits down on his throne it's for trial it's for reigning it's forgiving a sentence definitely so and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at meat in the pharisees house brought an alabaster box of anointments amen and brother branham refers the jews under the ultra altar and their and their prayers or the people's prayers is like an anointing or like like an order which goes up into the presence of god is that correct so look at this now here that woman saw the picture she knew who was in jesus that it was elohim that it was god so when jesus sat down in the house of simon that woman understood the picture she said the king is sitting down for judgment and she takes the alabaster art and anoints his feet so that the order goes up to him no matter that jesus said many generations would speak of that woman that was more than just social understanding that was someone who saw the picture the king sitting now on his throne it's time for judgment and what happens exactly so jesus stand up he condemns simon and he gives a sentence to that woman amen amen can you say amen the king sitting down the judgment is open moses sitting down up to the evening but in the evening time he stands up now trial is over sentence is spoken blessed be the name of the lord amen amen jonah now for the world come unto the king of nineveh and he aroused from his throne and he laid his robe from him and covered with sacros and sat in ashes now look how nice is the king of nineveh sitting on the throne and what does he do he's raining he's judging he's making decisions sitting on his own throne he's the highest authority in in nineveh and here comes jonah bringing the message and he understands who is in that prophet and he stands up from his own throne puts on sack roses and repents himself bringing this this judgment upon himself and god is so pleased because god sees himself in that king he says because i myself would stand up from my mighty throne and become men and take the judgment upon myself god saw himself in that unbeliever he said can an unbeliever please god because we are a little bit taught of uh first we can about all the sinners we have a right i mean we're the eagles who else atomic fire then we think we have a right to over every denomination that there is on earth though brother branham said they are nothing other than pennies but god uses pennies sometimes and then brother brahm said this every everybody everything that used that that served god purpose will have a resurrection praise be the lord let everybody who he is where if somebody is not called to your bride then we shouldn't despise that person let him be what god made him to be but give him a hand of respect and give him a hand of friendship amen and then we think we can despise everybody who doesn't believe in the message like us we were raised up in that thing these pentecostals these one and second pull preachers forget them and it created an atmosphere of a certain arrogance that we had and it was life that taught us some lessons of respecting people the way god made them and having a little bit of a patience until god changes situation because god had a lot of patience with us a lot a lot why shouldn't i have patience with my brother why should i be judgmental with everybody who is not believing like me so so you see did god see himself now that's just tremendous again you have to understand when when god wanted to destroy uh israel and moses was was having a better idea than god it was christ in moses and and moses said oh lord don't do this take me instead of them and that was christ the most and you must understand god was so proud of moses he said i can see my character in that boy amen when abraham when when when he was trying to save sodom he said lord if there is 50 and if there is 40 and god does elohim does this if you would not be very interested in that whole thing but he thinks by himself look this is my boy look because it's the heart of god to save we can god once said that everyone gets salvation he knows he will not work but it's the heart of god to reach your hand and give a chance and give a second chance and say that's my nature and when abraham tried to convince god of preserving sodom god says in his heart look this is my boy this is my messenger i remember that brother biscuit gave that that testimony about brother branham and it shows us how we even in our understanding how we have to grow into a maturity of dealing of putting all situation in in our hands not that we are the object of a situation but we are the master of the wind whatever happens to our families brother biscuit said this they went with brother branham to a denominational church sit in the first row brother bryan was called to be preached to should preach but they didn't allow him because he didn't believe in the trinity but they left brother brandon he was just sitting with but a huge new church and sitting in the first row so the minister comes up and brother brother i tell you one thing there is more lies in religion than there is in politics you have to fight for a clean heart to say heavenly father let this character be in me amen amen here comes that minister oh brothers and sisters brother branham couldn't come he's not here but we are so happy that jesus is here everybody everybody shows yeah jesus is here and brother bryan was sitting there in the first world pure lie and brother biscuit was sitting beside him and he and he wanted to stand up and say here is the man what a what a hypocrisy and he said and brother rem just stopped him in there and brother ram did as he if he wouldn't there not to embarrass now the situation the person and brother biscuit said this he said now i understand now i understood why he was the messenger and not me do you understand that this bride comes into a stature this bride will not be a child with charlie oh everybody the church and the church and the church stop it we have a father god is changing god is molding us god is taking character from us god is letting us go because we are the one taking over that country amen amen on the other side can you say amen so what happened amen here is for seven church ages god sent the messenger and whenever the messenger is rejected brother brahms said he seals his people and then nothing else comes than just uh plagues spiritual death that's what he says so there was a judgment for seven for seven church ages and he's sitting on his throne and here comes the lamb taking the book it's the same person but what does it mean the judgment is over for the bride amen amen taking the book amen throwing it down to its seven angel who is on earth right at that moment what does he do exactly what joseph did to his brothers revealing himself at his altar at his throne amen to understand now the seven seals are open god explains the whole plan of seven church ages can you say amen how he was leading all things and he shows joseph look that was my way for you and and for his brothers and and and and by this joseph can forgive god and he can forgive his brothers he now sees the picture you have to understand here is a jew he gets his white garments he goes to auschwitz i tell you one thing we were there visiting us at auschwitz and there is that still that cellar of the gas chamber and i entered in and it was like the presence of god was there it was for me like to go into a church never forgot that amen here is somebody and and and and and that you entering into that gas champion the only thing you can say shema israel i don't understand how how how can god allow for me and my family to go into this gas chamber and the person is is killed but on the other hand sides he wakes up and jesus stands there with a white robe amen it is i mean i preserved it for you amen and that person can say praise the lord it was a hard life but here's my white robe i was born to be a jew can you say amen now look at this so joseph reveals himself to his brothers as christ is revealing himself to his brothers because now the judgment is over the book is in his head the revelation is there he can unfold the plan and what happens in the book of revelation a new song a new song now you can't put this in music there's a truth behind imagine they were in egypt and under in that slavery and here comes the song the miriam singers are special yeah when israel was in a gipton land let my people go so they come out of egypt red sea everything here comes the preacher where are the musicians let's sing a song miriam let's sing a song together yes i have a special when israel was in egypt that song is was yesterday we are not singing songs of egypt we're singing songs of deliverance or not [Applause] do you understand that brother branham said every revival has its songs amen but i want to bring in the preaching by the opening of the world our preaching must be different we cannot sing the song of 2000 years of a closed book this is the revelation of the sons and daughters of god this must be positive this must be great it must our father reveal who we are can you say amen do you understand that message is not working on the outside that's part of it but our message is not confirmation and reformation our message is our father speaking to our heart and once you understand who you are you know how to dress the holy spirit will teach us amen can you say amen so look at this therefore pentecostalism never worked reformation never worked the work on the outside of person never worked but what worked when god showed his plan who he is and who we are and then there is a love affair between us and our father and then a person stopped my church and my church and my church and my church what in the future our churches will be closed that's so okay this church bcf it's a good auto garage brother but very good auto garage i see already here are the new ones here are the used cars i see and look at this when this church will be closed because of the pressure we will not cry we would say thank you god for the wonderful time that we're here but now i am the church but this is not a few as long as the doors are open come into the house of your father but when this house will be closed this house will never be closed can you say amen blessed be the name of the lord so so we're not worshiping the church we're not even worshiping brother brother branham amen we're christians no look at this fifth seal now i think just one thing that holds this nation together because they have always respected the jews god speaks a brother brent speaks of germany okay no he speaks of you okay that's right give him a place you honor a jew and god will honor you rather if you saw respect in your life you will get respect if you are soaring love you will get love but if we saw arrogance we will get it back amen now there is a bunch of jews that's renegade just like gentiles the same way but the real jew god put his name on the book before the foundation of the world and there he was murdered down at his time and remember now watch what did he do to little benjamin which is the type of the hundred and forty four thousand as we will get later see what he did he is just quick to bend him in front on his neck started hugging him his little brother that had been born into the family after he had been gone by his mother the first church orthodox church the four thousand were born in his absent absence while he was a way to get his gentle bride oh my don't just do that something to you to us the brother mark is where where where is now the difference between the 144 000 and all the jews who were killed in all the centuries look it's a bright type because when these jews were killed by the plan of god they died and on the other side they understood the plan god says look you get it you i explained you you were jews you had to die but said he purposely blinded the eyes of his children so that the gentiles could come in definitely so luther never understood that okay they understand god's plan on the other in the uh in the other dimension the 144 their eyes will be opened that they understand god's plan already in this dimension [Applause] now what you believe everybody will know on the other side because the bible said every knee shall bow and every tongue will confess not only that jesus is lord but that brother was the seventh angel everybody will know this but the bride sees it's already on this side there's a big difference between the bride and the church can you say amen so so so so look can you say amen blessed be the name of the lord so here it is amen joseph and i'm coming to the end i know oh wow my time is running i'm i'm i'm hurrying up now joseph reveals himself and he says i am joseph joseph doesn't doesn't say look you are this and you are that and you are and you did this and you did that he said just i am joseph now the work of a redeemer of an intercessor has different aspects this is what many people doesn't doesn't keep in consideration first thing joseph had to wait for the ignorance of the people they were just ignorant they didn't know the plan of god so joseph had to have his time in egypt then joseph was revealing to himself to his brothers that was at work of an intercessor the same way but now changing his work and now while he was revealing himself to his brothers he has to wait still because now the rest of the family who is not revealed joseph plan have to come in they are still in goshen they are still in canaan so somebody has to bring a message and says look joseph lives and he has prepared a place and joseph cannot close everything because he waits until all the family now understand where joseph is therefore we are still out in evolution finding people but i'm happy he's he he is not interceding for me this evening because of the ignorance of marcus becker that would be sad amen because he took the book amen and revealed himself can you say amen but but we believe not all of the family is yet in therefore we are still waiting therefore christ is still jesus is still waiting so that we're coming in amen can you say amen now look at this this is the final point when joseph was so much healed his brother said oh man if this is joseph now we will pay back and joseph said look it was god forget it don't you think that the holy spirit has a method of healing our of healing our hearts of healing our heart feelings of healing our stories don't you think the holy spirit wants to do it i said hey i want you to give the book only the lamb can open the book and you must be a lamb to be opened the book amen amen i mean if you hear people with their frustration i don't come to church because the people and the people in the church and the people and the ministers and brother marcus and the people and forget it forget it let's speak about your father how he allowed all these things to bring us in a certain condition and sometimes god allows situations sometimes we do not know what lays in our heart and god says i will show what's in your heart and i will bring up somebody who is so much really going on your nerves that they which you will see who is still living in you amen and then you say thank you father i didn't know what you revealed the circumstances revealed a certain immaturity in marcus becker so what we do is stand up and say heavenly father let me try it again let me be your son i try it again i will do it better next time god says we break we bring it again on you amen so that you can do it better next time now look at this while joseph says i am joseph he is revealing himself but while he is revealing himself his family is revealed automatically because while he says i am joseph they know who they are we are his brothers look for example joseph would go to any kind of an egyptian egyptian egyptian janitor in his palace or to any kind of an egyptian prince he would go before he says i am joseph and the man said huh but he goes to his brothers and says i am joseph and the brother said and we are his brothers you get it why joseph the revelation of jesus christ is the revelation of his bride while he is revealing himself the bride knows that i'm part of it [Applause] nobody in the garden of eden could tell eve who she is eve could say mr elephant um can you tell me from where i come and he says the elephant said look uh it's wonderful here it's perfect but i don't know where i'm what i'm doing here honestly it's just nice and the only one who could reveal to eve who she is was adam and the only one who can reveal to the bride who she is is the bright room while he is by he says who is this melchizedek the bride knows who speaks of me amen i mean who is this jesus oh i it tells me something it's the right amen can you say amen now joseph could just go even go to pharaoh pharaoh knew a lot of things pharaoh was strong in wikipedia honestly the whole they had nothing nothing else to do just wikipedia just searching but joseph could come and say pharaoh i'm joseph and pharaoh would have said so what because he was not part of the family but when he said to his brothers he didn't say you are this you are this he says i am joseph and everybody in the family said i can be a part of it can you say amen this is what this message does with us it shows our true identity we are born with a purpose god sent us into this earth and this messenger took away our our spiritual amnesia and what is he doing now he's molding us into a statue and we get our beatings and we're standing up and we say marcus stop acting childish you're a son of god stop acting denominational be a boy be a man one day you will get the scepter from your father's right end and brother abraham said said said might or power without character is satanic amen can you say amen so this last can you say amen so far isn't that wonderful there is a medium remedium remedy to heal our souls it's our father speaking to us it's our father revealing it was me the time it was not the brother that really did well that hurt your feet it was me i i brought up that situation between you both because i want to see your maturity can you handle the situation i mean in our spiritual minds there's two options fight or flight every psychologist can fight off light too much people in the message that search flight but we have to fight for brotherhood we have to fight for friendship you see sometimes people say look brother okay that is fine the brother is there and i'm there that is just fine and we live peaceful that's not peace that is cold war that's not peace that's cold war nothing else it's somebody who cannot handle that situation god allows a lot of situation that you just want to say can you handle can you now die your own ego and said i am right god is not innocent who's right but is there somebody said look hey no matter we are family and the bride cannot be divided we are family of god can you say amen god allows these things and look last quotation look brother brian and all of them that are just around okay amen look christ is the mystery of god revealed christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation see christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bible makes the bible a complete revelation of christ christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing brother said see what god is trying to get you can you say amen god is bringing everything up that we come into an understanding look i cannot be childish i have to grow into a mature i have to take the book not as a seminary i mean but let this book form in movie that i know i'm i'm a child of god and god is interested to form me to mold me every service that we have is a therapy because we wanted to come in our theophany and we landed in ohio [Laughter] and god says hey that thing do you understand to bring a person into that kind of a healing this cannot be done in a prayer line this cannot be done by laying on our hands this comes by spiritual understanding spiritual insight for a prophetic type of people who really can go now behind the curtain of time and understands their time they understand their life and once they understand their life they now understand others now you become a blessing to others now i have don't have to to to feed myself to push you a little bit down because you understand hey it's family of god i have to support my brothers because it's a family affair now we are stopping to say our church is you know uh you have to understand we we we are the super eagles i mean everybody's in the message but we don't talk about the church not even the park about a family a universal family where god has his children everywhere i don't i don't say that every message is a bride i wouldn't say this but god has his rights amen god knows where they are i made a purpose in my heart i'm not going like now who is here the unbeliever who's who was sleeping during my preaching this must be the this must be the so-called believer you see i mean i treat everyone like a bride everyone like a bride and then i know one thing i cannot be wrong in this i mean do you agree with everything no i don't agree with everything but if god doesn't change the man i cannot change him but i can love him and give him a hand he said hey god called you into this message you're in the hand of god why should god continue to change you can you say amen if the musician would come it was just hey i could just start preaching it was just my pleasure to share this word and i know this is a place here where you can share those thoughts because when the lamb takes the book mercy is not over that's nonsense mercy starts real mercy star or or you can call it uh whatever you call it but the great feast start you know the great thing and and what a father we have please i told the young person in toronto change that message from a religion to a connection with your father i mean if this message maybe we do you know the song i have a father have you ever heard it that's fine i think that's the one that's always singing i mean this message when brother branham left us um it's not a cult why should we make it cultish why should we this message is not a denomination why should we be denominational where is the sense of it amen this matter is not a new wave amen this message has not the man of the hour christ is the man of the hour why should i enter into that kind of nonsense young people come and they say look brother margaret that was so wonderful he uh he preached things that we never heard before he said yes because brother brandon never said it therefore you've never heard it before therefore you never heard just it's it's it's wonderful fantasy sometimes do you listen too much fantasy stories can you say amen this message is not a fact why should i be sectarian about it amen amen this message is not a pharisee religion why should i become a pharisee let me be happy let me be a happy german amen let me be a happy person knowing that i have a father amen that god has so much grace and love for me and i want to say this if i believe it for me why shouldn't i believe it for you why should why should we run around and make life easier for one another say hey you have a problem god bless you hey buddy we pray for one another okay we're friends okay i believe you have a calling okay do you agree everything you think brother marcus noah if you travel a lot you see a lot of things that i don't agree with but i'm gentlemen enough to say look this is in between them and god hey come on who am i okay hey god bless you was really wonderful to just share the thoughts oh is baby coming late but sometimes people after the church they are just standing outside and just talking and talking and talking so tonight is no time for talking anymore you have to go to bed directly okay hey as you youngsters remember sunday is father's day you behave yourself you bring a little present something nice okay and and god will bless you for this you honor your father god will honor you okay hate shalom i have a [Music] he father my heart [Music] [Laughter] [Music] before even time began my life [Music] he knows my life [Music] each tear that falls and hears me [Applause] [Applause] [Music] calls me this home [Music] he'll never leave [Music] for the chat [Music] he sees [Music] let's all stand i'm gonna sing that one more time [Music] [Music] leave me no matter where i go he knows [Laughter] [Music] he sees [Music] amen blessed be the name of the lord god is so good to bring us the revelation of himself because if you're part of himself the revelation of himself is also the revelation of us because we find ourselves in him amen i was thinking what brother marcus was preaching that the message is the solution you say brother chad you don't know my problem i don't need to know your problem because we all have the same problem the same problem come through hybridization because of rejecting the word of god and now we've fallen into this condition the whole world is into the condition because of leaving the protection of the word and then spiritual blindness came we come in spiritual amnesia and all of these conditions and everything happened because of this and we're all we all have the same problem we attach all kinds of names to different symptoms but it all comes back to the same root problem but the message is the solution i don't care what symptom you're dealing with or what effect of the fall that you're dealing with in your life amen the solution was the message god knew before the foundation of the world amen that he would open this revelation in the end time because in the end time we would have absolute victory over hybridization in the change of a body and what will bring the change of the body faith what produces faith the opening of the word so the solution is the message amen and i'm so thankful that god in this day and the day that we live amen took away spiritual amnesia and brought the solution to every problem is the revelation of the word no matter what we're dealing with amen the revelation of the word will fix it amen and i think sometimes for too many years we've we've tried to find solutions we've tried to find help self-helps and solutions and and great men and great ministries and we're trying to find amen the the the pill that will work the the solution the solution was given to us in the opening of the word and it will just go to the opening of the word and understand that whatever problem i have the revelation contained in this word will solve that problem then we found the solution amen the problem is we have the solution and we lay it down to go find the solution but the solution is the message because the message is christ it is christ fully revealed in this day to explain to us our life and how it got messed up and why we think wrong sometimes and why our emotions lead us in wrong ways and why people have hurt us and why there's problems in the world it's all explained in the message it's all christ revealing himself and revealing our position in him and how everything got messed up to begin with but how he's going to make it all right and i thank god every problem i have every complex every wrong thought is fixed by the revelation of the word and i say god help me not to forsake the solution looking for a solution the solution is the word that you've given us in this day the solution is on those tapes the solution is and then those messages the solutions is in fellowship with believers as they fellowship on the word that's the solution amen as you feed on the word as you come to services as you read your bible that's the solution so we all have problems but we all have been given a solution and i thank god that there's an answer to the question what is the question i don't care what the question is we have the answer i thank god for that man let that let the holy spirit take that open book word and begin to heal the wounds that are inside because all is well with the plan of god amen he hasn't forgot about us he hasn't made any mistakes with us amen amen he knows what he's doing let him know what he's doing and let his way be perfect and come to the real solution and take it as a solution not as church not as religion not as a better understanding but take the message as the solution to every problem we have marriage problems this is the solution amen we have complexes this is the solution we have heard from the past this is the solution this is the answer to the problem god would bring amen and what is it that's going to fix the jews amen what's 144 000 going to receive this same message that you're feeding on is what they'll believe and that'll be the fix to the problem so god brought the cure at the end to fix everything and we happen to live in that day i think it's a privilege to be alive today the one the one generation out of all generations that has the solution to every problem i say thank god [Music] are you happy are you thankful for the word let us never be neglectful let us never be negligent of what god has given to us but let us take it and receive it by faith and if we receive it by faith it will do the work he intended for it to do because god's going to have a mature bride my brother marcus was saying he's not brother bam said he's not coming back for a little girl he's coming back for a fully mature bride and this message is maturing us into his very likeness amen let it do its work oh praise be to god i enjoyed the word it helped me it fed me it was bomb from gilead for my soul amen i trust it was for you to thank you brother amen continue to pray for brother marcus as he travels he's got a big project that he's working on and man just pray that god will give him wisdom and direct his footsteps and give him the help that he needs at the right time and that that it'll be a blessing to many people and he's got other services to attend to here and preach before he goes home so just pray for him and pray that he gets a safe journey home and then he'll be a blessing everywhere he goes amen let's bow our heads and just thank the lord lord jesus we thank you for this word that you've given to us for god there was nothing that we can do in and of ourselves there still is yet nothing that we could do to help ourselves we can't change ourselves we can't help ourselves we can't make our problems go away we can't find our own solution but god we believe that you have given us the solution to every problem when you revealed your word to us you gave us everything lord we don't need to ask for more power the power was in the revelation of the word no we don't need to ask for more healing the healing is already given we don't need to ask it's already been given to us lord we're just asking that you open our eyes to it lord that we can see it and receive it by faith and allow the word to do the work that you intended for it to do in this day because when you came to bring a solution to the problem you brought an open book when you came to fix everything that was wrong you opened the seals and revealed the hidden mystery that is the solution to the problem lord we thank you for that we're so thankful that we live in this day god give us eyes to see and ears to hear in our heart to perceive what it is you've given us in this day and give us a desire to continually feast upon these things and lord may you quicken the life within us and quicken us to your very life and may we be more like you day by day i love you lord i thank you lord jesus i appreciate you lord for what you spoke to us today i pray that you bless our brother marcus that you would strengthen him and anoint him for the work you've called him to do bless him in the rest of his journeys here in the united states and his trip back home bless all the services and bless him as he works on this project you laid on his heart lord i pray that you give him the strength to do it the wisdom the leadership that he needs and the help that he needs father we love you we thank you for this book that you've given to us the open book the revelation of the word may it come in doing us what you intended it for for it to do to bring us lord to perfect faith to the perfect revelation that'll change these bodies and reverse the curse of the fall we thank you father for all you've done we ask your blessings over us as we go may these words that we've heard not depart from us as we walk out those doors but may they become part of us lord may we begin to live and manifest what was preached we love you lord we thank you we ask your blessing in jesus christ's name amen and god
