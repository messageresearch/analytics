[11:52] evening happy to be home very much happy
[11:54] to be home I hope you're happy to see us
[11:57] oh good okay it's mutual Mutual feeling
[12:00] we like that we can have bases for
[12:01] Fellowship so good to see you all this
[12:04] evening uh let you have your seats for a
[12:06] moment
[12:07] that's okay
[12:09] so here's my disclaimers I'm tired
[12:13] I'm very tired I just chugged an
[12:16] espresso trying to wake myself up I
[12:18] think we both fell asleep today brother
[12:20] Chad and I it was a long trip I want to
[12:23] have a deeper voice that sounds good
[12:24] again yeah I always like that and so if
[12:27] I slur my words if I say the wrong words
[12:28] you know we're well taught take me for
[12:30] what I mean not for what I say so you
[12:33] have to tune in and maybe catch the
[12:35] thought so
[12:36] God bless you really do appreciate all
[12:38] the prayers all the text messages when
[12:41] you're on the other side of the world
[12:42] and you're tired and then I get a head
[12:45] cold and you're weak and you just feel
[12:47] very very very little you think what in
[12:49] the world how can I ever be a blessing
[12:51] in this kind of weekend State and then
[12:52] you get a little text message a little
[12:54] encouragement you think well God has a
[12:56] principle and our weakness his strengths
[12:58] made strong so and we just had a
[13:00] confidence that God was using us to be a
[13:03] blessing but I'll be honest with you we
[13:05] came back with a blessing I don't I
[13:07] don't think you you can give a blessing
[13:09] without receiving a blessing in return
[13:11] and I came back very very blessed very
[13:13] encouraged in the fellowship and and the
[13:16] time spent with everyone so it was
[13:18] really really special so just feel like
[13:20] saying hi I don't know why it's like
[13:22] hello good to see everyone so I hope
[13:26] it's okay I was uh uh so we got home
[13:30] last night I think at three o'clock I
[13:31] spent an hour and a half fellowshipping
[13:33] with my family laid down on the couch
[13:35] passed out for four hours first got up
[13:37] ate something passed out again got up
[13:40] came in met with Brother Franco put
[13:42] together some pictures went home passed
[13:44] out
[13:45] so it's been a catching up on sleep but
[13:48] I only average like three hours of sleep
[13:49] the whole trip time we were there with
[13:51] the jet lag and everything and I don't
[13:53] sleep good in life anyhow and so so I've
[13:55] been catching up so this probably means
[13:57] I won't sleep for a week going forward
[13:59] but so it was really really good so if
[14:03] it's okay I'd like to um just kind of
[14:05] give you a background here this was a
[14:07] wonderful trip for the sake of being
[14:09] able to spend time in Fellowship not
[14:11] only with the Brethren but with brother
[14:12] Chad first trip obviously officially
[14:15] going overseas together and doing
[14:17] something
[14:18] in the form of ministry together and it
[14:20] was wonderful it was just good from time
[14:23] we left to the time we got back it was
[14:25] really really enjoyable really fun we
[14:27] had a good time we talked we laughed we
[14:30] were exhausted together we encouraged
[14:32] one another we poked and prodded each
[14:34] other to keep going so it was it was
[14:37] good to be there and you all know how
[14:39] this all happened originally we were
[14:41] supposed to go together and we didn't
[14:43] God had a different plan in mind and at
[14:47] the time it scared me to death and but
[14:49] we made it through and and then here we
[14:52] are eight years later I hadn't been
[14:54] overseas since 2019 first trip overseas
[14:57] I get a chance to go and I go back to
[15:00] where it all began in the Philippines so
[15:03] had a the first time I ever ministered
[15:05] was in the Philippines first time I ever
[15:06] baptized anybody was in the Philippines
[15:08] and I got a new one I dedicated a baby
[15:11] they had me dedicate a baby while I was
[15:13] there so that was that was fun that was
[15:16] really interesting like what I
[15:20] don't know what I'm doing
[15:22] so Philippine is a first for many things
[15:25] so so it's got a special place in my
[15:27] heart just the whole thing and how God
[15:29] confirmed so many things over the years
[15:31] and as you begin this journey I don't
[15:34] think any of us have a confidence in
[15:35] ourselves like as we get going like hey
[15:37] we get this figured out we know how this
[15:39] is going to work and the more I more
[15:41] I've lived walked with the Lord served
[15:44] him I find out I'm just along for the
[15:46] ride this is just something he's been
[15:48] doing I'm just here I I'm not doing
[15:51] anything I'm not trying to make anything
[15:52] happen God's just in control
[15:54] orchestrating and all I can do is just
[15:57] yield that's the the biggest thing I can
[15:58] do is just get out of the way and submit
[16:00] you know I'm My Own Worst Enemy in life
[16:02] and and I'm just learning to submit I'm
[16:05] learning to keep my hand up a little
[16:07] higher in my head down a little lower as
[16:09] we walk through this journey we just it
[16:11] builds our confidence in God that he's
[16:13] with us and he's leading us and guiding
[16:15] us so it was really a special time and I
[16:18] really appreciated every moment of it so
[16:21] if it's okay I want to start in on the
[16:23] PowerPoint presentation but before then
[16:25] I I kind of had a little thought before
[16:27] and this is a very broken up thing I
[16:29] hope this is okay but just a little
[16:31] thing that impressed me as an overall
[16:33] theme of the trip and then a little
[16:35] thought from at the end and and I I
[16:37] realized just how much I appreciate
[16:39] Fellowship I I really really enjoyed the
[16:43] fellowship with the Brethren from
[16:45] different churches different pastors and
[16:47] ministers meeting 100 I don't know 100
[16:49] different ministers there in Fellowship
[16:51] around the world and and honor and a
[16:53] respect each one not that they'd agree
[16:55] in every aspect of their understanding
[16:57] of of the message but they had enough
[16:59] love and respect one for the other one
[17:02] that there was a it was it created a
[17:04] wonderful time of fellowship with
[17:06] everyone and I was so blessed and
[17:08] encouraged by that and then you get so
[17:10] many times I mean we we really either in
[17:12] a service or eating with the brethren
[17:14] for like a weak solid and so we broke a
[17:17] lot of bread to no we broke a lot of
[17:19] rice together is what we did they don't
[17:20] eat much bread it's a lot of of rice and
[17:22] so I'm looking forward to not eating
[17:24] rice for a month and so uh but you know
[17:28] just spending that time in Fellowship I
[17:30] mean you look back in the ministry of
[17:32] Jesus Christ and how much time he was
[17:34] there fellowshipping and he loved that
[17:36] Fellowship sitting around a fire eating
[17:38] and just bring you know breaking some
[17:40] bread together and it just kind of
[17:42] brought the whole thing back together
[17:43] with me again you know so much time we
[17:46] we spend um
[17:48] we're so focused on certain things you
[17:50] know and trying to be this or get this
[17:52] right or do this but what you find is
[17:54] you have a common Bond and it was the
[17:55] love of Jesus Christ and the grace of
[17:57] God to you not anything we did it was
[18:00] the grace of God to us each and every
[18:01] one of us and so we can find a common
[18:03] Bond of Fellowship it's not what I did
[18:05] it's what he did and so you find that as
[18:08] as the more you talk you hear their
[18:10] testimony then they ask you about your
[18:11] testimony or how God used them here and
[18:14] how God used you here and and you begin
[18:17] to find out we just serve a great God we
[18:19] just serve a wonderful savior a risen
[18:21] savior a living God in our midst guiding
[18:25] and leading us through it and so that
[18:27] Fellowship just meant so much to me and
[18:29] you know in Psalms it says behold how
[18:31] good and how pleasant it is for Brethren
[18:33] to dwell together in unity
[18:35] and so there's something refreshing
[18:38] about it you know it's like an anointing
[18:40] that comes with it just feels you it
[18:41] makes you feel so good when you have
[18:43] that good Godly Fellowship you you know
[18:45] you experience it here with someone you
[18:47] know not maybe a trivial conversation
[18:49] but when it's a good Godly Fellowship
[18:51] you're encouraging them they're
[18:52] encouraging you you're you're you're
[18:54] giving a little and they're taking a
[18:56] little and it's a give and take you know
[18:57] and brother Branham said like brother
[18:59] Bosworth ask them the question you know
[19:00] what Fellowship is he said what is it he
[19:02] says there's two fellas One ship and
[19:04] there's a give and a take and there's a
[19:06] camaraderie and an understanding as time
[19:08] goes on and uh and there's not a one of
[19:11] us that I I find as a Christian there's
[19:13] not one of us that doesn't go through
[19:14] persecutions sufferings disappointments
[19:18] discouragements we have something in
[19:20] common and it's through all of that we
[19:22] begin to love the Lord more we become
[19:24] more confident in his grace before more
[19:26] confident it's leadership and it creates
[19:28] this Bond of Fellowship this basis of
[19:30] fellowship and it just meant the world
[19:33] to me and I had a little quote that I
[19:35] came across in Fellowship it's a sermon
[19:38] brother Brandon preach called Fellowship
[19:40] he said now when God made man in the
[19:42] beginning to he made man in the
[19:44] beginning to fellowship with him this
[19:46] then this man was in perfect Fellowship
[19:49] in the Garden of Eden he was in perfect
[19:52] fellowship with God and how it must have
[19:54] been in that day when God would come
[19:56] down in the cool of the evening and call
[19:58] out Adam he and Eve would come up and
[20:00] they would worship God and they would
[20:02] have fellowship and communion one with
[20:04] the other and that's the very thing that
[20:06] calls us together like this sitting
[20:07] together in Heavenly places in Christ
[20:09] Jesus fellowshipping in the Holy Spirit
[20:12] no differences among us we're all one in
[20:15] Christ Jesus A Perfect Harmony of
[20:17] Fellowship
[20:18] there's nothing like it that I have
[20:20] found in all the Earth is to come
[20:23] together in Heavenly places and have
[20:25] communion and fellowship with God and
[20:27] with each other now that's what God
[20:29] intended in the Garden of Eden then that
[20:31] Fellowship from God and man was broken
[20:34] by sin and God made man on the basis and
[20:37] the ground upon which man could remain
[20:39] or retain his fellowship and it wasn't
[20:42] through a get-together or an
[20:44] organization or through an education it
[20:46] was through the basis of the shed blood
[20:48] and that's the only place of Fellowship
[20:51] that we have with God today that's the
[20:53] only meeting place is through the blood
[20:55] of Jesus Christ that's exactly right
[20:59] and see that's where we have our basis
[21:01] of Fellowship that's where we can have
[21:02] things in common though we may not see
[21:04] everything exactly right we have one
[21:06] thing in common that's the grace of God
[21:09] and so he also says and men don't you
[21:12] just can't educate themselves you can't
[21:14] educate your way to uh to one another
[21:18] we got too many complexes you don't get
[21:21] you you don't get no complex by the
[21:23] blood of Jesus Christ you get love
[21:24] that's where you get love not complexes
[21:27] you don't get to a point you say I'm a
[21:29] little bigger than the other one I'm a
[21:31] little better than this one or I'm a
[21:32] little better than that one you just get
[21:34] your arms around everybody and it's the
[21:36] basis of Love through the blood of Jesus
[21:39] Christ just makes it to relive everybody
[21:41] even in their differences we're all a
[21:43] little bit odd to One Another We're
[21:44] supposed to be we complement each other
[21:46] and it creates a fellowship because we
[21:48] have things in common so
[21:51] I like that that's my thought on
[21:53] Fellowship sorry I enjoyed it I loved it
[21:55] brother Franco won't we start in on the
[21:57] PowerPoint presentation so
[22:01] everybody loving one another
[22:03] okay here we go so here's the trip and
[22:06] we started here on Thursday I think it's
[22:08] 6 a.m but the Chad picked me up
[22:10] and we traveled up to Detroit from
[22:12] Detroit we took our first flight over to
[22:14] Seoul South Korea and it was 15 and a
[22:17] half hours which they extended it for 30
[22:19] or 45 minutes to take us out and around
[22:21] Russia for some reason they didn't want
[22:23] us flying over Russia so then uh maybe
[22:26] that was a good thing who knows
[22:28] and so then we here's the Philippines
[22:31] from Seoul South Korea we took another
[22:32] flight four and a half hours down to
[22:34] Manila and when we got to Manila
[22:38] oh some little facts but the Franco put
[22:41] this together it's awesome I could never
[22:42] have done this 109 million people and I
[22:46] think they all came out to drive every
[22:47] time we went to go somewhere
[22:49] I'm pretty sure
[22:51] I told them all I says you all are far
[22:54] closer to perfection than I am because
[22:56] it's Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[22:58] patience you have way more patience in
[23:00] me Manila traffic is horrendous I miss
[23:03] everybody there but I don't miss the
[23:05] traffic at all it's an amazing amount of
[23:07] traffic a four-hour trip becomes a seven
[23:09] hour trip a one-hour trip it comes a
[23:11] two-hour trip so it was fun and some
[23:14] strange way
[23:16] so we started off with the blessing you
[23:19] know when you go for 15 and a half or 16
[23:21] hours and there's nobody between you
[23:23] it's awesome
[23:24] it's an amazing feeling that one time
[23:27] that first time I went over there I was
[23:28] on a six hour flight and I was the guy
[23:30] in the middle between some very healthy
[23:32] individuals healthy men very well
[23:35] healthy very so they were so healthy
[23:38] that it forced me to go stand by the
[23:39] bathroom for four hours to uh to have
[23:42] some space to my own and so that right
[23:45] there was a huge blessing just to have
[23:48] some space there here was our welcoming
[23:50] party uh it was really nice they they
[23:53] said we're here waiting for you and so
[23:54] you got brother Vernon brother Nestor
[23:56] brother June brother Sammy Brother Don
[23:58] Don and I'm forgetting the other ones
[24:00] brother the other brothers but just a
[24:01] really nice welcoming party they were
[24:03] excited to see us and um we got to
[24:07] brother Nestor so we got in around
[24:08] midnight one o'clock
[24:10] um I I and so we got to bed and I think
[24:13] there was 60 70 people staying in the
[24:15] home so it was a packed house Brother
[24:17] semester's house became a common place
[24:19] for everyone to go so thankfully brother
[24:21] Chad and I got a room to ourselves
[24:23] because some of the rooms had like 10 12
[24:25] people in it and so it was it was packed
[24:27] out so it was wonderful brother Nestor
[24:30] wants to thank everyone here for the
[24:32] home it's a beautiful home and it's a
[24:34] real blessing to not only his family
[24:35] it's a blessing to everybody he just
[24:38] opens his house up pretty much to
[24:39] anybody that needs a place to stay at
[24:41] all times so he really wanted me to
[24:44] personally tell everyone thank you for
[24:46] the help in building his home so we had
[24:49] our first breakfast first little time of
[24:51] fellowship with everyone and it was just
[24:53] so nice you know you go somewhere and
[24:55] you'd have time I met these two brothers
[24:56] and there's brother landlan in the blue
[24:59] his other two brothers are from one of
[25:00] the islands had a wonderful time of
[25:03] Fellowship just talking to him you know
[25:04] and they're both pastors of an assembly
[25:06] and it was just really special stood
[25:08] there I think for an hour hour and a
[25:10] half and got to build a relationship
[25:11] with both of them it was fun to meet the
[25:13] old friends and it was fun to make some
[25:14] new friends while we were there and made
[25:17] some lifelong friends again I know and
[25:20] then here's uh brother nestor's amazing
[25:22] table it's a tree it's like six inches I
[25:26] think it it took 12 people to carry it
[25:28] in so it's a it was it was a great table
[25:31] uh for us to be able to have some
[25:33] fellowship uh for breakfast around and
[25:35] see everybody's happy and but then
[25:37] Esther and sister Hannah there in the
[25:39] corner they took great care of us they
[25:40] fed us amazingly well too well we ate
[25:43] too much food wasn't used to that much
[25:44] food and um and then brother Nestor
[25:47] loves us so he took us to a coffee shop
[25:49] to get some good espressos we were
[25:51] craving good expressos and so he took
[25:54] good care of us in that regards and got
[25:56] a chance to to do that now the main
[25:58] purpose of what we went there for was
[25:59] brother nesters it was brother nestor's
[26:01] 35th year Church anniversary and that
[26:04] was the main objective I believe it was
[26:07] and then there was some added things to
[26:10] the objective so I think yeah a lot of
[26:12] services on brother Chad I was proud of
[26:14] him man I was like that's awesome
[26:16] brother Ted I'm glad they're putting
[26:17] more on you than me I'm really happy
[26:19] about that he's the man of the hour I'm
[26:21] like yes give it to him he's the man I'm
[26:24] sit here sick wanting to sleep for three
[26:26] days so but I was really proud of him he
[26:29] did good he just submitted the gift and
[26:31] God used the gift and um
[26:33] so yeah there's brother Nasser 35th year
[26:35] anniversary so the first day they
[26:37] actually
[26:38] um Saturday was a rest day Sunday they
[26:40] split us up I ministered in the morning
[26:41] at brother nesters brother Chad went
[26:43] over to brother
[26:46] um Vernon's yes but the Vernon's church
[26:48] and preached the morning service and
[26:50] then they all came back and brother Chad
[26:52] preached the uh the anniversary evening
[26:54] service a wonderful service light in the
[26:57] darkness uh people were really really
[26:59] blessed by it here's the the church so
[27:02] this is by the nestor's new church I
[27:03] don't know if there was pictures seen of
[27:05] it but it's a beautiful assembly
[27:06] beautiful church building there just uh
[27:08] and and the assembly there and those are
[27:10] packed it was packed out house so here's
[27:13] another picture of the the Saints there
[27:16] so and so it was a wonderful time of
[27:18] fellowship and uh here's brother Nester
[27:21] and everybody these are all the
[27:22] ministers that gathered up I don't know
[27:24] if they're over 30 ministers that were
[27:26] present
[27:28] and then oh and so I I have probably a
[27:31] thousand pictures I don't think we've
[27:33] smiled that much since I I don't think
[27:35] I've ever smiled that much in my life
[27:37] and in that short of time frame so
[27:40] um
[27:40] Filipinos love pictures they love
[27:43] pictures so every couple minutes we we
[27:46] were prepped and ready for a selfie so
[27:48] it was good but we've got our don't ask
[27:50] us for a picture right now okay just
[27:52] being honest with you there's not going
[27:53] to be any pictures from Brother Chad and
[27:54] I for quite some time right now so so
[27:57] um but yeah we're pictured out so it was
[27:59] fun though we had a good time with it
[28:01] these are the brothers there's brother
[28:02] Nester in the middle so it was a good
[28:04] time then afterwards we had a fellowship
[28:06] dinner so it was a beautiful Fellowship
[28:09] dinner they did a they did a wonderful
[28:11] job and everybody had a great time and
[28:14] and this one's for the kids I know they
[28:16] like that this will be the subject
[28:17] matter that they'll be talking about for
[28:19] the next couple days I threw that in for
[28:21] them they killed the fatted pig for us
[28:23] and it was delicious it was wonderful
[28:25] and don't feel bad everything that you
[28:27] have to live by dead substance something
[28:29] has to die for you to live and this
[28:30] piggy he upgraded himself in life he was
[28:33] feeding the Bride of Jesus Christ so he
[28:35] wasn't just a pig wandering around in
[28:36] the woods he was actually becoming a
[28:38] part of the Fulfillment of God's
[28:40] Ministry on her so it was a good thing
[28:43] um here's a little time of Fellowship
[28:45] around the table and that was wonderful
[28:46] so then that was Sunday and then Monday
[28:49] we had a ministers meeting
[28:51] and it was a wonderful time probably one
[28:53] of the highlights of the entire trip for
[28:55] me was being able to gather with the
[28:57] ministers and and just shared a little
[29:00] little thought and by the Chad share the
[29:02] thought and it was wonderful and uh it
[29:04] was really good and I think they were
[29:06] talking about the mercy seat or is Mercy
[29:08] over and explaining and obviously the
[29:11] where the bright age comes in in this
[29:12] lady to see an age and where we are in
[29:15] time and it was really good and then and
[29:17] then brother Nestor he's just so good at
[29:19] teaching and you know he got up and so I
[29:21] videotaped him for just a moment I hope
[29:23] it's okay just a real short little
[29:25] snippet of brother Nestor
[29:27] in action and do I
[29:32] okay just push it
[29:34] out
[29:37] outside
[29:44] see they closed the door but the uh the
[29:48] Lord is still continuing okay
[29:51] after well after day two
[29:55] so what's really nice about it is um one
[29:58] brother will present they'll all ask a
[30:01] question they'll ask a brother to
[30:02] present on it and then respectfully no
[30:06] one tries to convince somebody of
[30:07] another opinion they just offer their
[30:09] their understanding of it and so you can
[30:12] imagine it doesn't it's very respectful
[30:13] it's really sweet and it's kind and
[30:15] everybody has a mutual respect but
[30:17] they're honestly asking questions well
[30:18] brother have you considered this or did
[30:20] you look at it from this perspective or
[30:21] what about this and so and brother
[30:23] Branham said you ministers get together
[30:24] and you talk about these deep things
[30:25] together and that's what he said to do
[30:27] and and I just so appreciated seeing
[30:30] them in action you know it's it's it's
[30:33] um sometimes we can close the circle
[30:34] around us a little too much and brother
[30:36] bam said don't ever become clannish say
[30:38] don't do that he said draw your sick
[30:40] Circle bigger draw them all in bring
[30:42] them in and but it takes maturity to do
[30:44] that and uh and I appreciated seeing
[30:47] that on display watching them you know
[30:50] kindly go back and forth with their
[30:52] ideas and opinions on everything it was
[30:54] really really special to be able to see
[30:56] it in action and Lord willing maybe we
[30:58] can do something like that here if God
[31:00] should so desire so
[31:02] um it was good
[31:04] so then this is the impromptu service
[31:06] when you're when you're nobody argues
[31:09] with feather Nestor it's King Nester we
[31:11] say king king Nester has decreed that
[31:14] you will preach and if you object he
[31:17] smiles laughs and walks away it does not
[31:19] matter what your opinion is so he told
[31:21] Brother Chad with the surprise you've
[31:22] got Tuesday night service so he
[31:25] submitted
[31:26] um there's nothing else you can do so it
[31:28] was a wonderful service it's really nice
[31:29] and it was good to be there so then that
[31:31] was that was Tuesday and then Wednesday
[31:33] we began our travels this is a travel
[31:36] out to the province it's kind of pretty
[31:38] there
[31:39] um countrysides kind of pretty and so
[31:41] that was beautiful views as we were
[31:43] traveling out because we were on our way
[31:45] to Brother Don Don's church for his
[31:47] anniversary meetings and um they put us
[31:50] up in a nice little hotel very very
[31:52] pretty and then they put together this
[31:55] and I told him I said brother if you're
[31:57] going to get a picture of me can you get
[31:58] one that doesn't look like I'm shocked
[32:00] to be here you know it looks like what
[32:02] you what you want me to preach no I like
[32:05] rather you know so everybody else is
[32:08] handsome distinguished I'm like no I'm
[32:10] like shocked what so it was fun this is
[32:15] Brother Don Don wonderful brother we all
[32:17] know brother don don here it's just a
[32:19] just a special brother I really love the
[32:21] brother from the very first time I met
[32:22] him in 2015 and he was kind of explained
[32:25] to him you know he's God he knows that
[32:27] God's kind of calling to the mountains
[32:28] and he's got that ruggedness and I
[32:30] couldn't do what he does he's tough
[32:32] tough as Nails you know they'll travel
[32:34] and walk and Hike all day long to get to
[32:36] a remote Village and then preach there's
[32:38] no time for Preparation and then they'll
[32:40] go from that one and hike to another one
[32:41] and preach again and they're just rugged
[32:44] individuals we're not missionaries we
[32:46] just travel and you know drink coffee
[32:47] and speak you know these are
[32:49] missionaries these guys are rugged
[32:52] rugged individuals so they make you feel
[32:54] like sissies I told Brother Jazz like
[32:57] I'm a soft American I'm just being
[32:58] honest with you I can't do it but
[33:00] wonderful brother brother Don Don and
[33:02] you helped or brother Donovan helped him
[33:04] out I think with the tent and stuff and
[33:06] so he he appreciated all the help so
[33:08] that was the I I took service that night
[33:10] brother Chad went over to brother in so
[33:13] here's brother earnings church I believe
[33:15] this is Brother earnings and they were
[33:16] singing a special brother Chad brother
[33:18] Danny interpreted for him at brother
[33:20] earnings
[33:22] and so they had a good time of
[33:23] Fellowship there and then so we both
[33:26] traveled back then Thursday was morning
[33:28] service by the Vernon here's brother
[33:30] Vernon I think he's been here before you
[33:32] all know him and a wonderful brother he
[33:34] spoke on the seasons of our life and I I
[33:36] got a lot of good notes I'd like to do
[33:38] something around that for the Youth I
[33:40] got some ideas on it brother Chad got
[33:42] some good stuff from that and just
[33:44] talking about the seasons of our life
[33:45] there in the morning service and that
[33:47] was wonderful and here's Brother Don
[33:49] Don's church it's beautiful another they
[33:51] they work hard to make a nice atmosphere
[33:54] a nice Sanctuary for the for the
[33:56] Believers and so brother Chad had that
[33:58] evening service and brother June uh
[34:01] translated for him and so then it like I
[34:04] said if we're not preaching or in
[34:05] service we're eating and so we had
[34:07] another fellowship and uh we had another
[34:10] fatted pig that sacrificed for our our
[34:13] our Pro our gain we appreciate him and
[34:16] his sacrifice
[34:17] and so that was good and uh so uh the
[34:21] next morning we had breakfast where we
[34:23] went to a baptism and so five people
[34:26] wanted to get baptized um it was really
[34:28] special this young this I believe this
[34:30] was a minister that he was from like an
[34:32] island or something and he was so
[34:33] impressed by The Fellowship of the
[34:35] brethren in his denomination he was
[34:38] never allowed to even like shake the
[34:40] hands or embrace the ministry there was
[34:42] there was there were two two separated
[34:45] you know too high you couldn't approach
[34:48] to a minister but we're just brothers I
[34:50] mean there's no big ones Among Us no
[34:51] little ones Among Us it's just the grace
[34:53] of God in each of our lives and and he
[34:55] was so impressed by that like he'd come
[34:57] and shake your hand with the biggest
[34:58] smile on your face like wow you're
[35:00] shaking my hand you know he was just
[35:02] impressed by that and sometimes it's
[35:04] just those little things of being loving
[35:06] and caring you know and it had effect on
[35:07] him and so him and his wife wanted to
[35:09] get baptized and so that's that's his
[35:12] wife and then I believe there was three
[35:13] young young people I didn't get a
[35:15] picture of every young person but there
[35:16] was three other young people that were
[35:19] they got baptized and brother Chad and
[35:21] brother don don did the baptism there so
[35:25] so
[35:26] another picture again one of a thousand
[35:29] so I just have to pick the ones I can so
[35:32] from that then we took off and went to a
[35:35] campground so brother uh Danny has
[35:38] purchased some ground out in the
[35:40] countryside so that they could all the
[35:42] churches could have their own place of
[35:43] fellowship and have their own Campground
[35:45] for meetings and special meetings and
[35:47] and things of that nature so brother
[35:49] Danny and brother Nester were kind of
[35:50] taking us through and showing us what
[35:52] they're building what they're working on
[35:54] and it's quite going to be quite a
[35:56] facility when it's done it's quite
[35:58] beautiful
[35:59] but a lot of work to do over the next
[36:02] year or so and so they just kind of took
[36:04] us through everything showed us all the
[36:06] progress and the work and it was really
[36:09] neat to see they've got little little
[36:11] cabins you see the real neat little
[36:13] cabins for the ministers to come and
[36:15] stay in so and then this is their
[36:17] Fellowship Hall so it's quite an
[36:18] undertaking and quite a quite a vision
[36:20] that our brother has and he's working on
[36:22] and and it's really becoming a beautiful
[36:25] thing they can put on if you can tell
[36:27] what that is it's a little bit tricky
[36:28] but that's where they have their
[36:30] meetings under that tent and so it's
[36:32] like an open air area and I think they
[36:35] sat a thousand people there the last
[36:37] meeting joint Fellowship that they had
[36:39] and so that was really nice and then
[36:41] again Fellowship around food so that was
[36:43] really good as well from then we went to
[36:45] Brother vowels I don't know if you've
[36:47] heard of brother Val over the years
[36:48] brother Chad went there many many years
[36:50] ago here's brother Val he's right sweet
[36:52] sweet brother really funny brother
[36:54] really like him and uh he's standing
[36:56] there between brother Chad and I this
[36:58] was his church sweet little church
[37:01] and so that was wonderful and then we
[37:03] proceeded to go back for a four-hour
[37:06] drive back to the town which took us
[37:08] seven hours I think seven and a half
[37:10] hours with all the traffic back into
[37:12] town they split us up at this point I
[37:15] went with brother June and brother Chad
[37:17] went back with brother Nestor and so I
[37:19] wanted to give you a taste of of traffic
[37:21] so there's some things about the
[37:22] Philippines like traffic rules and lines
[37:25] they're all suggestions they don't
[37:27] really mean anything there it's just a
[37:29] suggestion use it if you want to don't
[37:30] use it if you don't want to so what's
[37:32] really interesting is these these this
[37:34] traffic that's going this way well this
[37:35] is on the wrong side of the road
[37:37] um you know there's two lanes on the
[37:40] right side you're supposed to go on that
[37:41] side but if the traffic gets too much
[37:43] they just go down whatever opening they
[37:46] have and so this is the wrong Lanes so I
[37:49] thought if it's okay we'll just show you
[37:51] a little portion so you can appreciate
[37:53] American traffic
[37:55] and so
[38:01] yeah that's a sidewalker that's not even
[38:03] that that there isn't even the road so
[38:05] again whatever space you can find and if
[38:08] your car fits you go for it
[38:10] and uh yeah
[38:12] so
[38:14] it's very pleasurable it's very
[38:16] wonderful I enjoyed every hour and maybe
[38:20] every 20 hours that we spent in the car
[38:22] it was great it was awesome so
[38:25] so glad it's over and when we're away
[38:28] from that at this point so it was good
[38:31] again my perfecting I needed more
[38:33] patience and I found out when I went to
[38:35] the Philippines so it was good and then
[38:37] the next uh the next night this is
[38:39] Brother June so brother June took care
[38:41] of me put me up in a hotel wonderful
[38:43] brother good friend at this point and
[38:45] and like anything they love the
[38:46] Philippines and they see a I guess a
[38:49] tall white person from America and they
[38:51] want to play basketball so we played
[38:54] basketball again you always think it's
[38:56] going to be a friendly match against
[38:57] Brothers with brotherly love and
[38:59] kindness until you play basketball and
[39:01] then you find out this is fierce this is
[39:03] to win you better protect yourself
[39:04] you're going to get hurt and uh so it
[39:07] was fun it was a good fun competitive
[39:09] game we had a great time and uh and it
[39:12] was just fun we sweated a lot and then
[39:14] we had a great time of Fellowship a lot
[39:15] of young Brothers young ministers coming
[39:17] up in his church and just sitting around
[39:19] the table talking to them about life and
[39:21] different things and it was just it was
[39:22] really neat it was really encouraging
[39:24] and so then that next uh next morning I
[39:28] had service there with brother June this
[39:30] is by the June at his church and then
[39:33] brother Chad went to Brother phenols by
[39:37] the finale yeah I believe
[39:38] um and so this is brother fenol and his
[39:40] church and this is um Sunday morning yep
[39:43] and then this is a little picture of it
[39:45] they put all the musical instruments up
[39:47] there on the stage it was really unique
[39:49] so I thought that was really neat so
[39:51] then after that then we proceeded to go
[39:54] to Sunday Services there was always two
[39:57] services and now we're all traveling to
[39:58] get to brother Danny Del Mundo's church
[40:00] for his church anniversary for Sunday
[40:03] evening so
[40:05] um brother Chad I think they wanted to
[40:07] wait brother Chad's like I don't want to
[40:08] wait let's hit the road let's get there
[40:10] because they kind of take traffic a
[40:12] little more relaxed than we do and um so
[40:14] he got there on time
[40:16] we did not I was supposed to speak first
[40:20] and brother Chad was supposed to take
[40:22] the main service I was just going to
[40:23] give an exhortation thanks and then so
[40:26] our two-hour trip to the church became a
[40:28] four-hour trip to the church so we got
[40:30] there late and they changed the order of
[40:32] the service to have brother Chad go
[40:34] first and it was a wonderful service and
[40:37] this is the church this is the the
[40:39] sanctuary there it made a lot of
[40:41] improvements and a really nice nice
[40:44] fellowship with them all here's brother
[40:46] Nestor and uh then our brother Chad
[40:49] preaching and and it was a really really
[40:52] good service
[40:53] this was the baby dedication my first
[40:57] cute little fella man I'm already
[40:59] homesick at this point you make me hold
[41:01] this little fella it's like very very
[41:03] homesick at this point and he's cute and
[41:05] now I want a little boy right Carrie
[41:07] let's go for it
[41:09] we can amen amen so we have more than
[41:13] two or three witness Heroes here at
[41:14] green with us Carrie so
[41:17] um that was really nice this is Brother
[41:18] Boyette a friend I made the very first
[41:21] time he's also a minister there by the
[41:23] Danny's wonderful brother really sweet
[41:25] sweet Spirit about him and it was an
[41:27] honor and a privilege to be able to
[41:28] dedicate his baby to the Lord and um and
[41:32] it was unique and I'll share this at the
[41:33] end though but um so obviously I didn't
[41:37] think I was going to speak which I was
[41:39] really excited about I didn't want to
[41:40] speak I was happy to just sit back and
[41:42] and hang out and then at the end brother
[41:44] Danny asked me to get up and and share
[41:46] whatever was on my heart and what was so
[41:48] interesting about that was as as we were
[41:51] stuck in traffic before the service had
[41:53] began I had just had a little sentence
[41:55] strike my mind and I wrote the sentence
[41:57] down and then I went and I grabbed a
[41:58] couple thoughts about it and and it was
[42:01] almost I turned to brother June after
[42:03] brother Chad started preaching I said
[42:05] look at these and I showed him the
[42:06] quotes and I showed him the sentence and
[42:08] it if it wasn't almost literally the
[42:10] exact thought
[42:12] um and and it was a unique thing to see
[42:14] and and so even as brother Chad was
[42:17] preaching on the wave Chief and this
[42:19] great resurrection and I'm thinking
[42:21] about those notes I'm like wow well that
[42:23] was interesting we both caught the same
[42:24] thought but I was so glad I didn't have
[42:26] to say anything because brother Chad
[42:27] just had so clearly wrapped it up it was
[42:29] so good and then brother Danny's like
[42:31] know maybe the Lord was hindering
[42:33] Brother Kyle to get here brother Kyle
[42:34] wants you come up and share your thought
[42:36] and and so then I I shared the thought
[42:38] and it and it really shocked me and I
[42:40] think it shocked everybody else as just
[42:42] a confirmation of the of God confirming
[42:44] the word that was spoke and just so
[42:46] clearly stating that was the truth you
[42:49] know what a resurrection that was but
[42:51] what a resurrection that this is and God
[42:53] is doing something and I had wrote down
[42:55] the bride is his victory not ours and uh
[42:58] and and then to see that we were even
[43:00] using the same quotes like a portion of
[43:03] the quote that brother Chad read was the
[43:04] top and then the portion of the quote
[43:05] that I had was actually the underneath
[43:07] of that quote about the wave Chief and
[43:09] it was like and he stopped there and
[43:12] then by the grace of God I just read the
[43:14] next portion that was in the quote and
[43:16] so you just come to find out God's in
[43:18] control of this it's not what we do you
[43:20] know time goes on you just get less and
[43:22] less confident in yourself you get more
[43:23] and more confident God's in control it
[43:25] just brings a rest and a security
[43:27] um as as life goes on no matter what
[43:29] you're doing whether it's ministering
[43:30] living where working having Fellowship
[43:33] that God's in the midst of his people
[43:35] and you just go to it just creates such
[43:37] a rest I mean the sum of a Christian
[43:38] Life rest
[43:40] just relax little bride calm down you're
[43:42] his victory it's not what you're doing
[43:45] it's what he's been doing all the while
[43:46] through you and so I just so appreciated
[43:49] that and and I'll share a little bit at
[43:50] that here at the end of this but it was
[43:53] wonderful to see and uh here's the
[43:55] brothers you got Brother Ray there in
[43:56] the middle there we got a chance to see
[43:58] him as well and all the ministering
[43:59] brothers that came from all around to
[44:01] support
[44:02] um brother Danny and to show their
[44:04] appreciation for the ministry and the
[44:06] church and so lots of pictures but the
[44:09] Paulo there a young Minister for the
[44:11] Danny son he's starting to preach doing
[44:13] a wonderful job and and then here's
[44:15] their family all together so then that
[44:19] night then we traveled back into the
[44:21] city so we could get a hotel near the
[44:23] airport and then the next day we just
[44:25] had some fellowship together again and I
[44:28] see the fish another fish that happily
[44:30] gave up its life to feed the body of
[44:31] Christ so they deep fry the whole fish
[44:34] it was really neat and this is Brother
[44:36] Sammy Durano um I'm a missionary in
[44:39] Mindanao is that right by the Chad minda
[44:41] now and been faithful for many many
[44:43] years I think brother chadwin the first
[44:45] time you went there was like five
[44:46] churches there or seven there was three
[44:48] churches now there's 34 churches I think
[44:52] all three of his sons are now pastors
[44:54] and ministers and they've just been
[44:57] laboring and they're very humble he's
[44:58] very quiet they're all just so sweet and
[45:00] kind but you see God just blessing their
[45:03] ministry as they continually looking for
[45:05] the last predestinated seed they're not
[45:07] stopping they're continually going doing
[45:10] what they can to serve God and and to
[45:13] find that last one and also for
[45:15] themselves to lay in the presence of the
[45:17] sun to ripen and so oh but going back to
[45:21] that so we're going to try to help them
[45:22] with some printing work so we're brother
[45:25] Chad was asking him on some titles and
[45:27] some different things so that they can
[45:29] get
[45:29] physical copies of of printed messages
[45:32] to to distribute to the churches up
[45:34] there so we'll be working on that to
[45:36] help support that here soon
[45:38] here's brother ernin
[45:40] um sweet brother and then this is
[45:42] brother James Toronto for the Chads he
[45:45] called him the little bodyguard he's
[45:47] brother Chad's little bodyguard he's
[45:48] about here on brother Chad but he's a
[45:51] Powerhouse I think he said he's a strong
[45:52] little fella so watch out and so we were
[45:55] able to help him get this uh new
[45:57] Workhorse really nice little motorcycle
[45:59] they needed a motorcycle they go up into
[46:01] the mountains brother James goes way up
[46:03] into those mountains they'll travel six
[46:05] seven hours by motorbike into the middle
[46:07] of nowhere to preach to a group of
[46:09] people so we were out we were able to
[46:11] help the brother get this really nice
[46:14] looking dirt bike so looks fun I think
[46:16] he's gonna have a great time we don't
[46:17] yet know how he's going to get on it
[46:21] um so it's a great mystery I'm sure
[46:23] he'll figure something out might put a
[46:25] little strap a little three foot step
[46:27] ladder on the back or something like
[46:28] that but some way or another our brother
[46:30] will will make that work we know he
[46:32] he'll make it work one way or the other
[46:34] so it's it's exciting he's going to have
[46:36] a lot of fun on that so
[46:38] so yeah and then so this is the last
[46:40] picture
[46:41] um of all the brothers mostly all those
[46:44] Brothers in the bank are the brothers
[46:45] from the islands it was a really big
[46:46] deal for them to be able to travel
[46:48] islands are very
[46:49] um poor areas not a lot of funds to be
[46:52] able to do this so it was a privilege
[46:54] for them it was a privilege for us to
[46:55] spend time with them again they
[46:58] encouraged us just as much as we could
[47:00] possibly encourage them I think they
[47:02] encouraged us more to see their
[47:04] faithfulness to see their Fellowship
[47:05] these are all pastors these are all
[47:07] ministers to see their love mutual love
[47:09] one for the other it just and this is
[47:11] how all men will know you're my
[47:12] disciples right you'll have love one for
[47:15] the other and so we're to see it in
[47:17] action is a wonderful thing you know you
[47:19] can speak about the gospel but why don't
[47:21] you live it I like to see living
[47:23] Epistles I believe that's the hour in
[47:24] which we're living God condescending
[47:26] from the thought to the word from the
[47:28] word to the life so it's manifesting
[47:31] time of the things that we've heard and
[47:32] it was good it was wonderful and I
[47:34] really appreciated that time of
[47:35] Fellowship
[47:37] that's it
[47:39] no more pictures
[47:41] none whatsoever so if you don't mind
[47:43] we'll just change here for a moment just
[47:45] share a quick little thought to you uh
[47:47] is that okay you stand for just a moment
[47:51] I I really didn't think I'd go more than
[47:53] half an hour I was kind of hoping to
[47:56] wrap it up but I guess I'm still
[47:58] standing here and they're still awake
[47:59] and so we'll we'll just see what happens
[48:01] here next I really don't know
[48:03] so why don't you turn in your Bibles to
[48:05] first John
[48:06] five verse four
[48:10] first John five
[48:13] verse 4.
[48:22] it says for whatsoever is born of God
[48:25] overcometh the world and this is the
[48:27] victory that overcometh the world
[48:29] even our faith just have a word of
[48:32] Prayer
[48:33] Heavenly Father Lord we've just come
[48:35] right now to look at your word Lord
[48:38] heavens and earth will pass away but
[48:39] your word will never fail Lord just take
[48:42] these little thought that's in my mind
[48:43] these words that you've spoken Lord and
[48:46] speak to our hearts encourage us Lord
[48:48] and help us Lord you know I don't have
[48:50] much in the form of notes but
[48:52] take what's In My Heart Lord use my lips
[48:55] to say what you once said we love you
[48:57] and thank you Jesus name amen
[49:00] maybe seated
[49:02] so really it's funny I have like three
[49:05] scriptures and four quotes that's all I
[49:07] got I don't have much here so just from
[49:10] this scripture this is the scripture
[49:11] that I had wrote down
[49:13] um as I was writing along to just give a
[49:15] word of exhortation and this is
[49:17] um the thought that brother Chad had
[49:19] been ministering on that I came up and
[49:21] just said a couple words and and we know
[49:22] that faith is a victory that overcometh
[49:24] the world it's not my human ability it's
[49:26] not my intellect it's that God placed
[49:28] something down on the inside of my my
[49:30] soul and it's a it's a faith it's a
[49:32] confidence that God keeps his word and
[49:34] my biggest battle is to overcome the ten
[49:36] spies the the five lying Spies of this
[49:38] flesh and the five lines lion Spies of
[49:41] the spirit realm remember there was ten
[49:42] spies that gave an evil report see taste
[49:45] fuel smell here imagination conscience
[49:47] reasoning infections and so I find out
[49:49] but there was still a Caleb in there and
[49:52] Caleb when Josh were standing there
[49:53] saying but we're more than able to
[49:55] overcome the obstacles to overcome the
[49:56] enemy to overcome all that's in front of
[49:58] us because we have a promise that's
[49:59] before us and we're going to the promise
[50:01] and oftentimes you just you don't you're
[50:04] weak in your body you're weak in your
[50:05] spirit realm you're beat up you're worn
[50:07] out you're tired and at the end of the
[50:09] day but there's something down on the
[50:10] inside a little faith a little Caleb
[50:12] saying but God's still more than able to
[50:14] overcome through using me to overcome
[50:16] this situation I'm just as strong today
[50:18] as I was back then and so it just as
[50:20] time goes on I've looked back through my
[50:22] life even just considering all of this
[50:24] and and I'll share this little portion I
[50:26] had had a dream when I was 17 and I had
[50:28] a dream
[50:29] that I was going to be traveling
[50:31] overseas with a minister and I knew it
[50:34] was my pastor and I knew I'd be
[50:35] preaching and I'd held that as a dream
[50:37] in my heart I never shared it with
[50:38] anybody but I was 17 years old and at
[50:40] the time I thought I was going to travel
[50:42] with my pastor at that time who was a
[50:43] Pentecostal pastor but that whole me
[50:45] preaching thing I couldn't understand
[50:46] that and then I've I've watched that
[50:49] over the years and I never shared it
[50:51] with anybody the very thought of me ever
[50:53] ministering scared me I wasn't smart
[50:55] enough I wasn't good at school I
[50:57] couldn't do anything like that but I
[50:59] always had that little dream that I
[51:00] always looked at and then you know
[51:02] coming up to 2015 when I was supposed to
[51:04] go with brother Chad overseas and I and
[51:07] I had that dream in the back of my mind
[51:08] and I was like could this be that you
[51:10] know and and so I went to pray and then
[51:12] as I'm I'm in there praying I'm like
[51:13] Lord I have this burden in my heart are
[51:15] you calling me to be a minister
[51:16] certainly you're not I mean there's no
[51:17] way I don't know enough I'm not able to
[51:19] do this there's no way I could help
[51:21] anybody you have to realize when I came
[51:23] to this church for the first time the
[51:24] Sunday school kids knew more about the
[51:25] Bible than I did I'd ask brother Jeremy
[51:27] I said brother I need a Bible study I
[51:29] don't know nothing you got to help me
[51:31] and so they helped me we had started
[51:33] having the Bible studies with brother
[51:34] Lonnie and so just in looking at that
[51:37] through my life I've recognized that you
[51:38] know God had purposes and he never was
[51:40] looking at my ability and that's the
[51:42] problem with us today we keep thinking
[51:44] as we're getting stronger we're getting
[51:45] more understanding we're getting things
[51:47] figured out no you're not you know
[51:49] you're you're you have no ability this
[51:51] has nothing to do with you remember it's
[51:53] not your Victory it's God's Victory it's
[51:55] Christ's victory in us it's not our
[51:57] ability and brother Brandon said there's
[51:58] one thing you must Master he said
[52:00] especially you young ministers is that
[52:02] is the thought of human ability you've
[52:05] got none and just as soon as you can
[52:06] conquer that then God can use you to
[52:09] conquer whatever obstacles are before
[52:10] you and so as I began to look at that
[52:12] and then I had went to prayer you know
[52:14] before I went on that trip with brother
[52:15] Chad I said Lord if you're calling me to
[52:17] the ministry I'm not able but if you're
[52:19] calling me will you confirm it on this
[52:21] trip and then when I went on the trip or
[52:23] the Chad couldn't go they send me there
[52:25] I cry I get sick I'm worn out I don't
[52:28] know what I'm doing I prefer paired the
[52:30] notes I lost the notes on the plane I
[52:32] said I'm a miserable nobody nothing good
[52:34] for nothing what in my world am I doing
[52:36] here God you know no notes don't know
[52:38] how to preach never preached before 750
[52:41] kids first time you want me to minister
[52:43] this is impossible how could you
[52:47] possibly use me in any function to do
[52:49] anything good and then God came on the
[52:51] same and God just uses insufficiency
[52:54] uses weakness uses Brokenness uses
[52:58] stupidity I left my notes on the plane
[53:01] but he even ordained that I do believe
[53:03] just so that I wouldn't rely on anything
[53:05] I could even do I would just have to go
[53:07] up there and say Lord here I am if this
[53:10] is a flop it's not my fault I didn't
[53:12] orchestrate this but the Chad was
[53:13] supposed to be there he should have got
[53:15] his passport ready it's not my fault
[53:17] it's not my fault brother Chad's fault
[53:20] it's not my fault but there I was
[53:23] and then looking back at that and seeing
[53:25] how it's trained it it went it continued
[53:28] on I've never gotten to a point where I
[53:30] felt capable to ever minister to people
[53:32] even today I feel more or less confident
[53:35] in preaching than I did then and I says
[53:37] I don't I told Brother Chad is this
[53:39] supposed to get easier it's supposed to
[53:40] get better right you're supposed to you
[53:42] do something long enough and you get
[53:43] more confidence I can do this and you
[53:45] realize I can't I don't know what I'm
[53:47] doing Lord I need your help but I think
[53:49] that's kind of the secret to the
[53:51] Christian walk I don't think it's ever
[53:53] in your journey you say I've arrived I
[53:55] think that's why Paul said having not
[53:57] apprehended I pressed toward the mark of
[53:59] the high calling in Christ Jesus I
[54:00] haven't grabbed what it is but there's
[54:02] something inside me pulling me towards
[54:04] it and brother Branham tells a little
[54:05] story about the stream you know and he
[54:07] says the stream that's bubbling all the
[54:08] time he says why are you bubbling all
[54:10] the time why are you bubbling is it
[54:11] because I drink from you is it because
[54:13] the deers he says no he says if that
[54:14] stream could tell you he said it's not
[54:16] me brother banham something behind me
[54:17] pushing me and I get to looking at my
[54:19] own life and I realize it's it's not me
[54:21] I never did anything I still can't can't
[54:24] do anything but something down on the
[54:26] inside it keeps pushing me keeps pulling
[54:28] me I don't know what it is it's his
[54:30] victory it's not mine I'm just along for
[54:32] the ride everyone I I and I and I've oh
[54:35] and I've I've just grown to love him so
[54:37] much more in that process it's not been
[54:40] easy it's constant there's difficulties
[54:42] there's struggles there's
[54:43] disappointments and it's all part of
[54:45] learning obedience through much
[54:47] suffering I want to walk with him I've
[54:50] always just wanted to walk with the Lord
[54:51] but I didn't you know like like we were
[54:53] talking about Fellowship there in the
[54:54] beginning the reason why we have
[54:55] fellowship with the Brethren is because
[54:57] we have things in common we could sit
[54:59] there and the one I think the brother oh
[55:02] what was that brother's name at the last
[55:03] sir brother Vernon's um Frank Francis
[55:07] we were sitting there he drove us in his
[55:10] awesome vehicle
[55:12] the brother the Filipino brother you
[55:14] know what was his name the brother the
[55:17] Filipino brother so we were sitting
[55:19] there talking to him and we were sitting
[55:20] at the table and I was sitting beside
[55:21] him and he started sharing with us a
[55:24] little bit that he was his wife was a
[55:27] Believer he was not a Believer he was a
[55:28] businessman and he was doing very very
[55:30] well but his wife is a Believer he
[55:32] didn't want nothing to do with it until
[55:34] he got cancer he said God tapped me
[55:36] tapped me got my attention he got a
[55:38] Cancer and then through that cancer he
[55:41] got desperate for God and through that
[55:43] little trial that tribulation that
[55:45] difficulty had awakened him to his
[55:46] sonship and sometimes God has to awaken
[55:49] you to your sonship it's not that you
[55:51] became a son you always were a son you
[55:53] just didn't know it and then God comes
[55:55] down your way like brother Brock you
[55:57] just didn't know it God just comes down
[55:58] your way and you have no idea what he's
[56:00] doing you don't feel worthy you're not
[56:02] capable it's because you're not and it
[56:04] God even sometimes that you go right on
[56:05] into making your bed in hell make bad
[56:08] decisions and you but God didn't forsake
[56:11] you in that he's right there with you
[56:13] even in hell you made your bed in hell
[56:16] it didn't you know if I Ascend to Heaven
[56:19] he's there if I make my bed in hell he's
[56:21] there so you make your own bed there you
[56:24] make your own bad decisions sometimes in
[56:26] your own pride and your own human
[56:27] ignorance or arrogance I should say and
[56:30] you make your own bed and you have to
[56:31] sleep in it but you know what God's
[56:33] still there and I love that about him
[56:35] he's been with me even in the mistakes
[56:37] I've made even in the discouragements
[56:39] I've had even many times I never wanted
[56:41] to preach again I'm like I don't want to
[56:42] preach I'm not good I can't do this and
[56:45] you get discouraged and you get down and
[56:47] yet he's still there he said it's okay
[56:49] my son's just having a bad day he'll
[56:50] come out of it you know and he's still
[56:52] there and I just love that about him
[56:54] he's never left me never forsook me he's
[56:57] still with us leading us guiding us
[56:59] through all life circumstances and
[57:01] difficulties he's still there and so as
[57:03] you begin to go on you get to seeing
[57:05] just how much I believe he's so present
[57:08] in our lives that sometimes we don't
[57:09] realize it and I think we should con we
[57:11] should consider it sometimes we're
[57:13] taking too many things for granted like
[57:15] just go back to your life see where
[57:16] you've come from I was looking back I'm
[57:18] thinking that dream and that situation
[57:20] there and it led to this and and I'm
[57:22] like what it's been going on for these
[57:24] last 40 years here I am today I never
[57:26] would have thought I'd sit in here and
[57:27] preach but it's something God for
[57:29] ordained never even would have thought
[57:31] that I could have recognized my day and
[57:34] its message I knew in my heart I was
[57:36] crying out you've heard that testimony
[57:37] go up on top of my roof something inside
[57:39] me saying Lord if I only knew where you
[57:41] were I'd climbed the highest mountain to
[57:42] find you I'd forsake everything and I'd
[57:44] come after you and here we are
[57:47] I wasn't looking for him he came looking
[57:49] for me he came looking for you you
[57:51] weren't looking for him he came looking
[57:52] for you like left to our own devices we
[57:56] will destroy ourselves if it isn't the
[57:59] grace and mercy of God watching over you
[58:02] each and every day of your life you will
[58:04] utterly destroy yourself one day you're
[58:07] finished God ever removes his hand of
[58:09] grace and mercy and protection on life
[58:11] you're done you are done this has
[58:13] nothing to do with our ability we've got
[58:16] no ability that's the great Victory is
[58:19] that God found a people that recognized
[58:20] they got no ability in this thing that's
[58:23] where I think that God's Great Victory
[58:25] is coming into view it's that he found a
[58:27] people that are the bride what makes
[58:30] them the bride they're humble they're
[58:32] broken they're Meek they they love
[58:35] because they found another we found
[58:36] another little sister Hattie right a
[58:38] broken poor simple woman that believed
[58:43] at the hearing of the word that ain't
[58:44] nothing but the truth and so then
[58:47] hearing saying the right word at the
[58:49] right time in the presence of the right
[58:51] person she was just the right kind of
[58:53] woman for the third pole Ministry to be
[58:55] manifest and here we are looking at
[58:57] another time God found another woman
[59:00] she's simple she's broken she knows it
[59:03] she's good for nothing then God gives
[59:05] her the opportunity have whatever you
[59:07] want but she'll say the right thing
[59:09] she'll ask for something Eternal not for
[59:12] something carnal not something to
[59:13] satisfy this own Earthly Journey she's
[59:16] going to look and call for the right
[59:17] thing something that has an eternal
[59:19] perspective about it so it just makes
[59:21] you look a little higher and it brings a
[59:23] little bit greater rest for each and
[59:24] every one of us because I'm recognizing
[59:26] that this is God working amongst us it's
[59:29] not me it's him and so it just it's just
[59:32] an interesting thing to see that what
[59:34] God has been doing in each of our lives
[59:36] through these years we're learning just
[59:38] as just has anybody arrived yet like is
[59:41] Emma no good we have Fellowship we all
[59:45] find we're failures we're all failures
[59:48] but I'm just so glad that he found
[59:50] failures uh like us and he could take
[59:53] our failures and be our strength he
[59:56] could have a victim will the bride have
[59:57] a great ministry oh yes but it'll be so
[1:00:01] humble so simple so so common to the
[1:00:05] world to look at it and say there's
[1:00:07] nothing to that person and here you
[1:00:09] don't even realize there's a manifested
[1:00:11] Son of God who just came to himself one
[1:00:14] day like that prodigal son you know he
[1:00:16] left as a son
[1:00:18] and he he when he left as a son and he
[1:00:21] was down in the pig's pen he came to
[1:00:23] himself and when he came to himself and
[1:00:26] he was going to go back to his father he
[1:00:27] didn't go with the mindset I am the son
[1:00:30] he went as a servant and when he
[1:00:33] realized he was nothing he could just
[1:00:34] maybe in the eyes of his father come
[1:00:36] back to him as a servant the father
[1:00:39] restored him as his son
[1:00:40] and I'm finding my own life is going
[1:00:42] through that same process you know and
[1:00:45] you you find out you're a Son of God by
[1:00:47] God's grace he awakens you and and
[1:00:49] you're so excited but then even you make
[1:00:51] your own mistakes and you make your own
[1:00:53] bed in hell you make bad decisions and
[1:00:56] God doesn't forsake you he just lets you
[1:00:58] wrestle it out
[1:00:59] eat the pig pen
[1:01:01] wait for the grace of God to come your
[1:01:03] way opens your eyes and say what am I
[1:01:05] doing here where did I go and God in his
[1:01:09] grace you'll then go to the father with
[1:01:11] your head bowled I'm sure that son when
[1:01:13] he came back in the with the attitude of
[1:01:15] a certain he didn't come say watch out
[1:01:16] everybody I'm the son get out of the way
[1:01:19] that's why I don't like that arrogant
[1:01:20] attitude I am the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:01:22] get out of my way don't don't ever take
[1:01:24] that attitude I think the attitude of
[1:01:26] the Bride of Jesus Christ is so humble
[1:01:28] so Meek so broken so understanding of
[1:01:31] the grace and mercy of God and lies that
[1:01:33] had nothing to do with you it was Grace
[1:01:36] Grace to you that's why we can stand and
[1:01:39] you know the angels will won't
[1:01:41] understand us they can never understand
[1:01:43] this Plan of Redemption they won't be
[1:01:45] able to sing it like we can sing it
[1:01:47] because we know none of us will have a
[1:01:49] problem on that day of taking off our
[1:01:50] crowns and throwing it at his feet
[1:01:51] because we know we had nothing to do
[1:01:53] with this I'm not great there's nothing
[1:01:56] good with me it was the grace of God
[1:01:58] that made me a son I'm just his grace I
[1:02:00] am just his victory on this Earth and so
[1:02:04] I don't believe there's any boasting in
[1:02:05] the bride I believe Revelation humbles
[1:02:08] you down I believe education
[1:02:10] understanding and information will puff
[1:02:13] you up but if it's Revelation it
[1:02:15] produces the life of Jesus Christ in you
[1:02:18] and you become submitted to doing the
[1:02:19] father's will not your own and then
[1:02:22] that's what always I I I don't want to
[1:02:24] preach on it because that's a whole big
[1:02:26] subject but one of the things I had
[1:02:27] preached on when I was there was
[1:02:28] Ascension by condescension
[1:02:30] and I was looking at almighty God as
[1:02:32] here as Brother Band said here's
[1:02:34] almighty God he was so great so powerful
[1:02:36] he had to look down to see the heavens
[1:02:38] and but but when he manifested and came
[1:02:41] in the flesh
[1:02:42] he went to the lowest city in the
[1:02:44] country
[1:02:45] and the shortest man in the city
[1:02:47] Zacchaeus brother Brahma dramatizes said
[1:02:49] he had to climb up on a garbage can to
[1:02:51] get up on a tree and the shortest man in
[1:02:53] the city was looking down on the king of
[1:02:55] glory
[1:02:56] so you see that God in what God
[1:03:00] condescended he kept coming down when
[1:03:03] you've seen him in flesh it was a
[1:03:05] condescension of God and then he came so
[1:03:07] low that he even went down into hell
[1:03:08] condescended all the way down to Hell
[1:03:10] took the keys of death hell and the gray
[1:03:12] and redeemed it and then he even
[1:03:14] condescended even more and came down
[1:03:15] into this hell this life this mud and
[1:03:18] this muck of my life this failure this
[1:03:20] miserable Heathen boy and he
[1:03:23] condescended the greatness of God
[1:03:24] condescended all the way down to reach
[1:03:26] down and pick you up pick me up what a
[1:03:29] condescension this is this is a great
[1:03:32] condescension and then I began to
[1:03:34] realize so God then you know God wanting
[1:03:36] Fellowship is this okay I hope it's okay
[1:03:38] like I have I don't have notes I'm just
[1:03:40] talking I told you and so like God
[1:03:42] wanting Fellowship you have to have
[1:03:43] things in common right we have to have
[1:03:45] things in common for a husband and wife
[1:03:46] to have good Fellowship they have to
[1:03:47] have things in common for two brothers
[1:03:49] have to have Fellowship we have to have
[1:03:50] things in common have to understand each
[1:03:52] other right so God condescended from the
[1:03:54] highest Heights he said this whole Plan
[1:03:55] of Redemption is really for the purpose
[1:03:57] of Fellowship God wanted fellowship with
[1:03:59] his attributes right and so God stepped
[1:04:01] out of Eternity came into time loud for
[1:04:03] a fall so that we could go through the
[1:04:05] process of of life and difficulties and
[1:04:09] so God wanting to understand us he
[1:04:10] became a man
[1:04:11] brother bam said he went through pain
[1:04:13] rejection he got sick he went through
[1:04:16] all of that so we could he could
[1:04:18] understand us but then God so now we
[1:04:21] have to understand God so you have to
[1:04:22] look at that's God understand us but
[1:04:24] what about us understanding God so then
[1:04:25] God lifts you up out of the mud of the
[1:04:27] muck you find out you're a son of
[1:04:29] almighty God a manifested attribute of
[1:04:31] God himself on Earth
[1:04:33] but what does it do to you
[1:04:35] you then go through a process of
[1:04:38] suffering and rejection and despisement
[1:04:41] and ridicule so that you can understand
[1:04:43] what he went through
[1:04:45] so then as he lifts you up you by your
[1:04:48] own choosing began to condescend out
[1:04:52] you see what I'm saying so it's an
[1:04:54] Ascension by condescension it's not how
[1:04:56] big we are it's how little we can go
[1:04:58] because brother man said only big men
[1:05:00] can become little
[1:05:01] only a big man not a little man a little
[1:05:03] man can't can't do that but a big man he
[1:05:06] can do that and so and okay I gotta come
[1:05:09] now I got a quote now I have a quote I
[1:05:11] just did I got a quote so brother bam
[1:05:14] says in crisis and Ministry says oh if I
[1:05:16] could just get the world to see this
[1:05:17] there you are there's the body of Christ
[1:05:19] Living standing a redeemed oh my
[1:05:22] justified in his sight why why are we
[1:05:25] Justified we are his victory the church
[1:05:28] is his victory we come forth in these
[1:05:30] last days with this glorious gospel
[1:05:32] showing his victory he died for this
[1:05:35] purpose we are the proof of that Victory
[1:05:37] amen when I see him coming down and
[1:05:39] living amongst his church that's his
[1:05:41] victory showing that he couldn't keep
[1:05:43] him in the grave neither can he keep us
[1:05:45] that's right we are already potentially
[1:05:48] arise because we've raised from the dead
[1:05:51] unbelief in his word from denominational
[1:05:53] Creeds to an eternal word of the Eternal
[1:05:56] God which is himself working through US
[1:05:58] manifesting himself that he is the same
[1:06:01] yesterday today and forever he's alive
[1:06:05] everyone we're not pointing to an empty
[1:06:07] tune of 2000 years ago we're pointing to
[1:06:09] living Epistles that have been raised up
[1:06:11] out of Creeds and denominations you
[1:06:13] don't think it was a big deal that God's
[1:06:15] been raising up his body you don't think
[1:06:17] it's a big deal that God spoke the word
[1:06:19] called you out of dead denominationalism
[1:06:21] Dead traditions of your man your own
[1:06:23] human pride and he pulled you up out of
[1:06:25] that lifted you up why he's the same
[1:06:28] yesterday today and forever he's a
[1:06:31] living Risen Savior this Church of the
[1:06:34] Living God is the proof of his
[1:06:35] resurrection not to point to an empty
[1:06:38] tune of 2000 years ago but to see the
[1:06:40] body of Jesus Christ manifested
[1:06:42] attributes of his grace living Epistles
[1:06:45] red of all men condescending from the
[1:06:47] highest Heights becoming the lowest of
[1:06:48] lowest and of individuals
[1:06:50] gods and flesh again
[1:06:52] but remember when God's in flesh it's
[1:06:55] never ascending it's never saying look
[1:06:57] at me remember where that attitude came
[1:07:00] from that's a spirit that's an
[1:07:01] antichrist spirit that becomes something
[1:07:03] look at me I'm the big one I have the
[1:07:06] great understanding I'm the Bride of
[1:07:07] Jesus Christ remember who ascended who
[1:07:09] wasn't content with their position
[1:07:11] Lucifer Lucifer wasn't content in the
[1:07:14] position that he had as the right hand
[1:07:15] of God he wanted to be a little bit more
[1:07:17] you see that that discernist lust that
[1:07:20] he had to be a little bit better just a
[1:07:23] little bit better than God and to exalt
[1:07:26] his his position above the stars of God
[1:07:29] you see what he was doing with that
[1:07:31] attitude he was a beast
[1:07:34] and when he tried to go up he went to
[1:07:37] the pits of hell
[1:07:38] let's see the difference here
[1:07:40] we are already seated in Heavenly places
[1:07:43] in Christ Jesus The Virtuous body of
[1:07:45] Jesus Christ manifested on Earth the
[1:07:48] attributes of God but watch what you'll
[1:07:50] do in this life
[1:07:51] watch God in flesh God in flesh doesn't
[1:07:55] make himself big God and flesh makes
[1:07:58] himself little
[1:07:59] because only a big man can get little
[1:08:01] and that's what we're finding out so
[1:08:04] Brad have a great ministry yeah but so
[1:08:06] humble so simple remember when they
[1:08:08] lifted him up it struck me years ago I
[1:08:10] shared with brother Jeremy when God
[1:08:12] lifted him up before all the people how
[1:08:14] was he lifted up
[1:08:16] on a cross
[1:08:17] that's how God lifted him up before the
[1:08:20] people and waved him before the people
[1:08:22] what was it a man that submitted his
[1:08:24] will to God's will he said not my will
[1:08:26] be done but thine will be done God and
[1:08:28] God lifted him up as an example before
[1:08:30] the people what was it a man that chose
[1:08:33] to do the will of God he fought it out
[1:08:35] in the Garden of Gethsemane and he
[1:08:37] dripped great drops of blood as he began
[1:08:39] to say it's not my will there's any way
[1:08:41] for this cup to pass me by but it's not
[1:08:43] my will it's God's will be done so he
[1:08:46] chose his own crucifixion
[1:08:48] he chose his own crucifixion then the
[1:08:51] question comes to the Bride of Jesus
[1:08:52] Christ you have to choose your own
[1:08:54] crucifixion who whosoever seeks to save
[1:08:57] his life is going to lose it whosoever
[1:08:59] lose his life for my sake he'll have it
[1:09:01] right and so now we're in this process
[1:09:04] of choosing because thou has chosen the
[1:09:06] harder way thou has walked in thine
[1:09:07] owned choosing thou has chosen the
[1:09:10] correct and precise way and it is my way
[1:09:12] right so you have to make some certain
[1:09:15] choices along this journey you've got to
[1:09:17] make some harder choices that will
[1:09:19] humiliate you and debase you for his
[1:09:22] glory
[1:09:23] every one of us are here we all have
[1:09:25] decisions we can be making on a regular
[1:09:27] basis I don't believe that it's the
[1:09:29] easier way like I even said that to some
[1:09:31] of the young Minister I don't know who
[1:09:33] it was I was talking to him at brother
[1:09:35] June I said hey be careful
[1:09:37] um you know if you God's calling to the
[1:09:40] ministry and I says here's something
[1:09:41] that's going to happen and he started
[1:09:43] telling me about a job opportunity that
[1:09:44] he had and I said be really careful with
[1:09:47] that I know that looks like that's a
[1:09:49] good thing because it looks like God's
[1:09:51] blessing you with a greater job but you
[1:09:52] also know that God called you the
[1:09:54] ministry so right at the time God's
[1:09:56] calling to you the ministry you get this
[1:09:57] great opportunity I says be careful that
[1:10:00] may not be God there because remember
[1:10:02] you have to choose the harder way and it
[1:10:04] just I've learned in my own life own
[1:10:06] situations that I've I've made big
[1:10:08] boo-boon mistakes it seems like God's
[1:10:10] pulling me here here comes a great
[1:10:12] opportunity and just be careful you have
[1:10:14] to be aware of those things wherever the
[1:10:15] spirit of God's moving Antichrist
[1:10:17] Spirits right there beside it working
[1:10:19] too and that's just something we've
[1:10:20] learned right in this in this journey
[1:10:22] and so and brother Branham also said
[1:10:25] this um and brother Chad was talking
[1:10:27] about that wave she he said as Christ
[1:10:29] was on that was the first one to raise
[1:10:32] from all the prophets and so forth
[1:10:34] although typed in many places he was the
[1:10:36] first fruits of those that slept in the
[1:10:38] bride in the bride coming of Christ
[1:10:40] coming out of the church there will have
[1:10:42] to be another wave Chief again in the
[1:10:45] last days oh my the waving of a Sheaf
[1:10:47] what is the Sheaf it's the first one
[1:10:49] that come to maturity and the first one
[1:10:51] that proved it was wheat that proved it
[1:10:54] was a Sheaf Hallelujah I'm sure that you
[1:10:57] know what I'm talking about it was
[1:10:58] waived over the people the first time
[1:11:00] there will come forth in the bride age a
[1:11:03] resurrection out of dark denominations
[1:11:05] there will be a message that the full
[1:11:08] maturity of the word has been turned
[1:11:10] back again in its full power and being
[1:11:12] waved over the People by the same signs
[1:11:15] and wonders as he had back there because
[1:11:18] I live you live also speaking to his
[1:11:21] wife because I live you live what a
[1:11:23] resurrection that was what a
[1:11:25] resurrection that this is to be
[1:11:27] quickened from the dead to be made alive
[1:11:29] in Christ Jesus by the quickening power
[1:11:31] of God and I was listening I read it is
[1:11:35] the rising of the sun on the way back
[1:11:36] there brother Brandon was talking about
[1:11:38] that quickening power that quickening
[1:11:39] power he said if you look at that
[1:11:40] quickening power he says Enoch obeyed
[1:11:42] every word
[1:11:43] he says Elijah obeyed every word and as
[1:11:47] he was they were walking in the
[1:11:49] Simplicity of just obeying every word
[1:11:51] quickening power came and then you begin
[1:11:53] to look at job and I was considering job
[1:11:55] and his his own condescension it looked
[1:11:57] like when job was uh okay so did it look
[1:12:00] like God job was getting closer to God
[1:12:03] when he lost all of his children
[1:12:04] everyone dies
[1:12:06] all of his wealth goes away loses all of
[1:12:08] his businesses all his friends turn
[1:12:10] against him even his wife says your
[1:12:11] breath is strange unto me he lost the
[1:12:13] reputation of life is he getting closer
[1:12:15] to God or farther away
[1:12:17] job's going down but all the way as he
[1:12:19] got all the way down into that position
[1:12:21] what happens he says then he saw a
[1:12:24] revelation of the Resurrection that in
[1:12:25] his flesh he should seek God so as he
[1:12:28] was going down he was going up as Joseph
[1:12:30] was getting thrown into the pit and then
[1:12:32] cast into slavery and then going into
[1:12:34] prison was he getting closer to the
[1:12:35] throne or farther away from the throne
[1:12:37] he was closer to the throne you think
[1:12:39] about that right so in every one of
[1:12:41] these situations you can pick one up
[1:12:43] after another one look at the Hebrew
[1:12:44] children as they were walking closer to
[1:12:46] the fire with every step the fire is
[1:12:48] heated up seven times in their own
[1:12:50] choosing of their own destruction were
[1:12:53] they going farther away from God or were
[1:12:55] they just entering into the presence of
[1:12:56] God they were getting ready to walk
[1:12:58] right into the reality of a living God
[1:13:00] the Fourth Man manifested in himself in
[1:13:02] the presence of his people as they were
[1:13:04] choosing their own death
[1:13:07] they made their own choice you chose
[1:13:11] your own destruction
[1:13:13] but actually it was your Resurrection it
[1:13:16] was the resurrected Jesus Christ drawing
[1:13:18] close to you as you were going down
[1:13:20] and I've just found this to be the
[1:13:22] pattern it's the pattern that God has
[1:13:24] always restored Fellowship in is when
[1:13:26] you choose to die on your cross when you
[1:13:29] choose to be debased humiliated made fun
[1:13:32] of rejected
[1:13:34] spit at and you do nothing
[1:13:37] you say nothing you don't even defend
[1:13:39] yourself
[1:13:40] you don't have a reason to why because
[1:13:42] it's Christ in you remember when Christ
[1:13:44] was manifested in the flesh they made
[1:13:46] fun of him they ripped his beard out
[1:13:47] they spit at him they spoke all manner
[1:13:49] of evil against him they accused him
[1:13:51] falsely
[1:13:52] and he opened not his mouth
[1:13:54] there's God in flesh there's power on
[1:13:58] display he had all the power to change
[1:14:01] the scene and he did nothing but what
[1:14:03] the father showed him what to do he
[1:14:06] wasn't ever defending himself he wasn't
[1:14:08] trying to deliver himself
[1:14:10] he chose his own death for our Victory
[1:14:12] and so now I'm getting to choose my own
[1:14:15] death for his victory and so it's just
[1:14:17] the most amazing thing
[1:14:19] another Bantam says here he says um
[1:14:22] oh yeah
[1:14:23] he says now if we if they have to have a
[1:14:27] crew they have to have a crucifixion
[1:14:29] before you can have a resurrection and
[1:14:32] before the church will ever able to be
[1:14:34] able to see a resurrected power before
[1:14:37] you can ever see a new ministry take
[1:14:39] place in myself before you can even
[1:14:41] enter into a new fellowship with God
[1:14:44] there has got to be a self-crucifixion
[1:14:47] so that there can come a resurrection
[1:14:51] you've got to die out to your thoughts
[1:14:53] you've got to die out to your ways you
[1:14:56] got to die out to everything that's
[1:14:57] around us and go through the trials and
[1:15:00] the tribulations that we might see a new
[1:15:04] resurrection and a new life before a
[1:15:07] sinner can become a Christian he has to
[1:15:10] die then a resurrection isn't that
[1:15:13] interesting
[1:15:14] my so the next time your trial comes
[1:15:17] your difficulty your rejection your
[1:15:19] persecution comes just embrace it don't
[1:15:22] even defend don't even try to escape it
[1:15:24] God's ordained it for a greater
[1:15:27] expression of the resurrected power of
[1:15:28] Jesus Christ displayed in our lives it's
[1:15:31] just something interesting how many are
[1:15:32] craving more of a resurrected quickening
[1:15:34] power in your life to help you Quicken
[1:15:36] yourself to I am I really really am and
[1:15:39] now I'm realizing ah okay there's a
[1:15:41] little key die
[1:15:43] okay with every little decision God
[1:15:46] gives me these two options one will be
[1:15:47] the harder way one will be the easier
[1:15:49] way I'm gonna choose the hard way
[1:15:51] because I know the harder way will lead
[1:15:52] me closer into his presence I just know
[1:15:54] that that's the truth so that's my
[1:15:56] honest heart's desires just help me to
[1:15:58] crawl upon this uh cross you know D.L
[1:16:01] Moody made the comment he says the
[1:16:02] problem with the Living Sacrifice he's
[1:16:04] always trying to crawl off the altar
[1:16:07] that's the problem with a Living
[1:16:08] Sacrifice he always wants to defend
[1:16:10] himself he always wants to preserve his
[1:16:12] life it's hard to die everyone it's just
[1:16:15] hard to die and to live every day with
[1:16:18] that in mind Paul says I Die daily I Die
[1:16:22] daily every time I wake up in the
[1:16:24] morning I got my choice either live for
[1:16:26] Christ or live for Kyle which disorder
[1:16:28] decision do I get to make we each all
[1:16:30] got these choices we all have these
[1:16:32] decisions to make hope this is okay okay
[1:16:36] sorry uh will you turn to Philip uh yeah
[1:16:39] I almost said Philippines Philippians
[1:16:42] I got Philippines on my mind Philippians
[1:16:46] chapter 3 verse 10.
[1:16:49] and musicians why don't you come
[1:16:53] um
[1:16:55] Philippians chapter 3 verse 10.
[1:17:01] I I truly in this life I really truly
[1:17:04] just want the fellowship with the Lord
[1:17:06] and have fellowship with his attributes
[1:17:08] that's all I'm craving at this point I'm
[1:17:10] I'm not I don't I never have desired to
[1:17:13] be considered a great Minister a great
[1:17:15] person I just want to walk with the lord
[1:17:17] it's all my heart's desire has been
[1:17:19] since I was a kid
[1:17:21] so and uh so whatever God's got to do to
[1:17:26] get us in that position that's the only
[1:17:28] thing I'm interested in at this point
[1:17:29] and so it says in Philippians 3 10 it
[1:17:32] says that I may know him and the power
[1:17:34] of his resurrection listen And The
[1:17:38] Fellowship of his sufferings being made
[1:17:40] conformable unto his death you see
[1:17:44] if you want to know the power of his
[1:17:46] resurrection you must understand the
[1:17:48] fellowship of his sufferings you're
[1:17:51] never going to see a resurrected Jesus
[1:17:52] Christ in the power fully displayed in
[1:17:54] you unless you can embrace the
[1:17:56] sufferings that God has ordained for
[1:17:57] your life
[1:17:58] I want to know him he wanted to know me
[1:18:01] I want to understand him I want that
[1:18:04] basis of fellowship with my Lord and
[1:18:06] he's just ordained the right amount of
[1:18:08] situations the rejections the right
[1:18:11] things to happen in this life so I can
[1:18:13] know him I can understand him and he can
[1:18:16] understand me that's that's what he
[1:18:18] wanted that relationship between a
[1:18:20] husband and wife but the band says
[1:18:21] sometimes in life you have tensions you
[1:18:23] have really difficult times he says but
[1:18:25] when it's all said and done the tensions
[1:18:27] are over husband and wife can Embrace
[1:18:29] each other with more of a love and
[1:18:31] understanding of the other person than
[1:18:33] they ever did before he says let the one
[1:18:35] disappoint the other one this one
[1:18:37] disappoint this and but let them come
[1:18:38] back together then they'll understand
[1:18:40] each other and love each other more than
[1:18:42] ever before and now I'm seeing that God
[1:18:44] set this whole basis of Fellowship in
[1:18:47] place this whole Plan of Redemption this
[1:18:49] whole desire that he had Fellowship he
[1:18:52] wanted fellowship with me wanted
[1:18:54] fellowship with you and so God in his
[1:18:57] mercies just ordained just the right
[1:18:59] trial the right sufferings the right
[1:19:02] disappointments the right rejections for
[1:19:05] you so that you can understand him
[1:19:07] because if your ultimate desires just to
[1:19:09] know him so you can walk with him then
[1:19:11] this is all part of the plan everyone
[1:19:13] this is just part of the plan don't be
[1:19:15] discouraged don't get upset don't run
[1:19:18] away it's all part of the plan of God
[1:19:21] you have to remember you ever think
[1:19:22] about like yeah what like
[1:19:24] why are we here like what what are we
[1:19:27] doing I I I come to church to find my
[1:19:30] bad spots I come to to be corrected I
[1:19:33] come to hear from God because I want to
[1:19:35] know him and I'm not wanting to know
[1:19:37] about him I want to know him and so in
[1:19:39] understanding knowing him I gotta walk
[1:19:41] as he walked I gotta go through the
[1:19:42] things he went through I gotta suffer
[1:19:44] the way he suffered and never work to
[1:19:46] defend myself I just have to embrace it
[1:19:48] I have to say Okay Lord now I get to
[1:19:50] climb up on that cross I'm not going to
[1:19:53] fight it anymore just crucify me if
[1:19:55] that's what you want crucify me kill the
[1:19:57] vessel because I really just always
[1:19:59] wanted to walk with him just wanted that
[1:20:01] fellowship with the lord it's all I've
[1:20:02] ever desired so you see
[1:20:05] that I may know him in the power of His
[1:20:07] Resurrection The Fellowship of his
[1:20:08] sufferings being made conformable unto
[1:20:11] his death if by any means I may might
[1:20:14] attain unto the resurrection of the Dead
[1:20:16] not as though I had already attained
[1:20:18] either were already perfect look at the
[1:20:21] attitude of Paul but I follow after that
[1:20:24] I might apprehend that from which I have
[1:20:27] I am apprehended of Christ Jesus
[1:20:30] Brethren I count not myself to have
[1:20:32] apprehended
[1:20:34] but this one thing I do forgetting those
[1:20:36] things which are behind and Reaching
[1:20:38] Forward are those things that are before
[1:20:40] I press towards the mark of the high
[1:20:43] calling in Christ Jesus how many are
[1:20:45] going to press I'm pressing I'm reaching
[1:20:48] out I'm going to actually embrace the
[1:20:50] sufferings and trials that God's
[1:20:52] ordained for me because I know I'm going
[1:20:54] to see a greater Resurrection in this
[1:20:56] flesh as I do so won't you stand
[1:21:00] hope it's okay I just shared my heart
[1:21:03] nothing in my head just stuff in my
[1:21:05] heart and I pray that it was for the
[1:21:07] glory of God and it was a help to you
[1:21:09] all this evening and I just love him I
[1:21:12] really love him appreciate the prayers
[1:21:13] on the trip and I
[1:21:16] looking forward to what he has in store
[1:21:18] for us it may not look good it may not
[1:21:21] look so comfortable but it's going to be
[1:21:23] the very thing that brings us right into
[1:21:24] his presence this the the the heat of
[1:21:27] the fire mate gets seven times hotter
[1:21:29] may get pretty intense but just remember
[1:21:32] you're going to walk right into his
[1:21:34] presence it looks like a fire but just
[1:21:36] who's in the fire is my question who's
[1:21:38] in that fire when Daniel you know the
[1:21:41] question went for Daniel hey we're going
[1:21:43] to kill you if you bow your head and
[1:21:45] pray you know this right we're going to
[1:21:46] kill you never stop you let me just open
[1:21:48] the door about his head began to pray he
[1:21:51] chose his own physical destruction
[1:21:53] because he wanted fellowship with God
[1:21:55] and as he wanted to maintain that
[1:21:57] fellowship with God he knew it would
[1:21:58] cost him his life they grabbed him they
[1:22:00] throw him into a pit but who was in the
[1:22:02] pit
[1:22:03] the angel of the Lord was there to shut
[1:22:05] the mouth of the Lions he went gotten
[1:22:07] thrown into the pit when he was ready to
[1:22:08] sacrifice his will in his own life to
[1:22:11] maintain fellowship with the Lord those
[1:22:13] Hebrew children they weren't going to
[1:22:14] Bow the knee they were not going to
[1:22:16] compromise with this world no way they
[1:22:19] were going to say that's okay if God
[1:22:21] wants to deliver us he will if he
[1:22:23] doesn't my destruction that's fine but
[1:22:25] they found him in the middle of the fire
[1:22:27] job found him as a Risen Savior and now
[1:22:31] the Bride of Jesus Christ choosing her
[1:22:33] own condescension her own destruction
[1:22:36] she's going to find him again in the
[1:22:38] very midst of her life a resurrected
[1:22:40] Jesus living and moving and acting in
[1:22:43] each and every one of us
[1:22:45] don't you love him I I don't know what
[1:22:48] else to say I just I I just love him
[1:22:51] Luke says and he said unto them if any
[1:22:54] man will come after me let him deny
[1:22:56] himself take up his cross daily and
[1:22:58] follow me for whosoever will seek save
[1:23:01] his life will lose it but whosoever will
[1:23:04] lose his life for my sake shall save it

[1:27:09] and like his word the lady trust he
[1:27:19] [Music]
[1:27:23] will be because
[1:27:33] [Music]
[1:27:51] I know yes I know
[1:28:00] younger
[1:28:03] and life is worth the living foreign
[1:28:16] amen aren't you glad he came to you
[1:28:20] we never could have found him
[1:28:22] we never could have found his location
[1:28:24] or where he was or how to climb that
[1:28:26] high we weren't capable
[1:28:29] came down
[1:28:30] and it should cause us to want to come
[1:28:33] down for others amen for someone else
[1:28:36] you know and I appreciate that it was
[1:28:39] amazing how we you know took the service
[1:28:41] I think it was I think Brother Kyle was
[1:28:45] 45 minutes late to that service I think
[1:28:46] it was 45 minutes late they walked in
[1:28:48] they actually had to to walk in I was in
[1:28:51] the middle of preaching they had to walk
[1:28:52] up the middle aisle come around behind
[1:28:54] and sit down so I just turned around and
[1:28:56] greeted him and shook their hands
[1:28:58] because there was no way to coordinate
[1:29:00] the effort you know there was no way to
[1:29:03] piece this together and what Kyle was
[1:29:05] supposed to say at the beginning were
[1:29:06] those thoughts that he had and I told
[1:29:08] him later I said it actually worked way
[1:29:10] better as a capping than it did as a
[1:29:12] foundation God knew how to place it and
[1:29:15] what was amazing is everybody could see
[1:29:17] it we could see that you know God was in
[1:29:21] control and it all worked out just
[1:29:23] perfect and it ended up being a
[1:29:25] tremendous blessing the the capping that
[1:29:27] that God had given to Brother Kyle and
[1:29:31] you know Kyle was probably a little
[1:29:32] nervous in traffic
[1:29:34] probably just a little frustrated and
[1:29:36] then this frustration that being late
[1:29:38] probably passed away when he felt like
[1:29:39] he didn't have to preach at all so
[1:29:41] frustration probably turned to Joy and
[1:29:44] then when he found out at the end
[1:29:45] brother Danny gave him like 30 seconds
[1:29:48] notice you're gonna go ahead and speak
[1:29:51] but we saw God in all of it
[1:29:54] and we can see God in things like
[1:29:56] traffic
[1:29:58] being laid how much more so in
[1:30:00] everything that happens in our lives
[1:30:03] when did God get amnesia and forget
[1:30:05] about us
[1:30:07] when did God forget where we were when
[1:30:09] did he look away and not notice we had
[1:30:10] just got in trouble you know that's our
[1:30:13] perspective we feel like God didn't see
[1:30:15] and now we're in a panic mode and God
[1:30:17] doesn't know and I've got to call God
[1:30:19] down on the scene right now no God never
[1:30:21] lost his it never took his eye off you
[1:30:24] he never lost what was happening
[1:30:26] everything's under control if we can
[1:30:28] just stay humble and submissive God will
[1:30:30] work it all out
[1:30:31] man I tell you it was a wonderful trip
[1:30:34] for me it had been four years almost
[1:30:36] four years since I've been to the
[1:30:37] Philippines and you know covet had
[1:30:39] changed so many meetings and so many
[1:30:40] appointments to get back together and
[1:30:43] see the Brethren again it refreshed a
[1:30:45] joy a refreshed a fellowship it was very
[1:30:48] refreshing to me and I realized these
[1:30:50] brothers had become such close friends
[1:30:52] to me brother Nestor and brother Danny
[1:30:55] brother Vernon brother June uh Brother
[1:30:59] Don Don and brother Aaron and brother
[1:31:00] Val I mean these aren't just names of
[1:31:03] Brothers on the other side of the planet
[1:31:04] these are dear friends to me
[1:31:07] and to go back and see them again and
[1:31:09] see how God had blessed them over the
[1:31:10] last four years they had prospered
[1:31:13] spiritually and did prospered physically
[1:31:15] The Works that they were doing were
[1:31:17] growing the outreaches were continuing
[1:31:18] people are still coming to the Lord
[1:31:20] people are still receiving the message
[1:31:22] it's a wonderful thing and it just was a
[1:31:25] rejuvenation for me to see it all
[1:31:27] continuing on
[1:31:28] and it made me you know want to do more
[1:31:30] I want to do more I want to do more than
[1:31:33] I've done to watch what they do always
[1:31:35] inspires me to want to do more and like
[1:31:39] uh Brother Kyle was saying when I first
[1:31:41] went to Mindanao and many of you
[1:31:43] remember went there many years ago and
[1:31:45] preached in the prisons there remember
[1:31:47] the pictures of baptizing the inmates in
[1:31:49] a 55 gallon plastic drum when I went
[1:31:52] there I believe there was three churches
[1:31:53] there three maybe four and they've been
[1:31:57] working since that time getting the word
[1:31:59] out and now there's 34 churches
[1:32:02] I say praise God I'm so encouraged that
[1:32:05] God is still finding his children
[1:32:07] that the work goes on and I want to just
[1:32:09] continue to do our part and just pray
[1:32:12] for them pray that God will continue to
[1:32:14] bless them we want to do what we can we
[1:32:16] want to still be a help to them and the
[1:32:18] missions efforts we want to help them do
[1:32:20] what they're doing and so we we're going
[1:32:22] to continue doing that by the grace of
[1:32:24] God we all work together

[1:33:26] let's bow our heads and pray
[1:33:28] dear Lord Jesus we thank you so much
[1:33:31] so appreciate God seeing how you
[1:33:34] orchestrate things
[1:33:36] that we could not have figured out
[1:33:38] things that we could not have
[1:33:40] orchestrated
[1:33:41] you have a way of moving all the pieces
[1:33:44] you have a way of making your plan work
[1:33:47] in our lives even without our
[1:33:49] understanding sometimes we're not
[1:33:51] comprehending many things many times
[1:33:53] what's going on what's happening in our
[1:33:55] lives
[1:33:56] God you're teaching us if we could just
[1:33:59] abase ourselves and stay humble and stay
[1:34:01] low
[1:34:02] and trust in you and have confidence in
[1:34:04] you not in ourselves
[1:34:06] then those things we can't figure out
[1:34:08] those things that might even cause us
[1:34:09] some anxiety or fear if we can just lay
[1:34:12] ourselves in your hand and trust you you
[1:34:14] will work them all out that you have a
[1:34:17] plan
[1:34:18] I thank you Lord for the ability to come
[1:34:21] and bring a good report from afarland
[1:34:24] showing all is well there all is well
[1:34:26] here that you're in full control
[1:34:28] that the message is going on and that
[1:34:30] you're growing your children into your
[1:34:32] very likeness trial by trial word by
[1:34:35] word revelation upon revelation
[1:34:38] God what you're doing and our brothers
[1:34:40] and sisters overseas you're doing in us
[1:34:42] here
[1:34:43] oh we're so thankful for that
[1:34:45] help us to stay yielded and humble and
[1:34:47] submitted as you work out Redemption for
[1:34:51] God you're displaying your victory
[1:34:54] your Victory and the purpose of your
[1:34:56] death is to have a bride of your own
[1:34:58] choosing at the end time standing In
[1:35:00] Your Glory not something we can do but
[1:35:04] only something we can surrender to God
[1:35:06] we're trusting in you to make it all
[1:35:08] happen in our lives bless us as we go
[1:35:11] from here bless our Brethren Lord back
[1:35:13] in the Philippines use them continue to
[1:35:16] use them and show us ways in which we
[1:35:18] can help Lord we love you we ask for
[1:35:21] your blessings as we depart in Jesus
[1:35:24] Christ's name we pray
[1:35:25] amen
[1:35:27] remember before we sing I just want to
[1:35:29] share one thing that motorcycle that
[1:35:31] Brother Kyle showed you the picture of
[1:35:33] uh brother James there he he rides these
[1:35:36] motorcycles over rivers up mountains
[1:35:40] where there's no road to take the gospel
[1:35:42] to churches to go and encourage churches
[1:35:44] and brother Nestor during his
[1:35:46] anniversary the The Collection he wanted
[1:35:48] to take he wanted that collection to go
[1:35:50] to that motorcycle
[1:35:52] and so what brother Nestor says is he
[1:35:55] told everybody there is we want to give
[1:35:56] we want to give to help these brothers
[1:35:58] go farther and brother Nestor says
[1:36:00] nobody gives zero
[1:36:03] nobody gives zero and and when he said
[1:36:06] that it just struck me with impact we're
[1:36:08] speaking to a group of people at an
[1:36:10] anniversary meeting some are our
[1:36:12] corporate employees and have good jobs
[1:36:14] some are from America we have finances
[1:36:16] some are tricycle drivers we drive a
[1:36:19] tricycle motorcycle Taxi
[1:36:21] some have a lot some have very little
[1:36:23] some have next to nothing and our
[1:36:26] tendency is to let he who has more give
[1:36:28] and don't put the burden on but brother
[1:36:30] Nestor said nobody gives zero because in
[1:36:32] giving is a blessing
[1:36:34] and I thought what a lesson there should
[1:36:37] be none of us giving zero
[1:36:41] zero effort zero to the body of Christ
[1:36:44] zero to the work of the lord we should
[1:36:46] all have something to give and in giving
[1:36:49] there's always a blessing and so they
[1:36:53] gave they all gave everybody gave
[1:36:54] whether it was a peso or two or more and
[1:36:57] we were able to give some fun some funds
[1:37:00] that this church contributed to we were
[1:37:02] able to carry that over and give also
[1:37:04] and there was enough to buy the
[1:37:06] motorcycle
[1:37:07] and say let that be let that be a lesson
[1:37:10] that we take away that nobody give zero
[1:37:13] let us nobody come to church and just be
[1:37:15] a taker that day let nobody be part of
[1:37:19] the fellowship and we're always the ones
[1:37:20] to receive let us also find a way to do
[1:37:23] and nobody gives zero I mean that comes
[1:37:26] from a brother who's been a missionary
[1:37:28] and a pastor for decades and I say
[1:37:31] that's good God help me to be found at
[1:37:33] the end of The Journey not just a taker
[1:37:34] but let me never give zero let me always
[1:37:38] give something amen God bless you as you
[1:37:40] go it's been good good to be home good
[1:37:43] to see your faces good to worship
[1:37:45] together amen I appreciate the word this
