TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he said those that obtain that message in their hearts must lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened so who's the message what's the message and what's ripening amen are you with me remember the ministry of the bride is the same ministry of the groom not another ministry it's the same ministry all right so he said he said we've got to lay in the presence that you can pick up the message and then let the sun bake all the greenness out of you see making matured christians this is the end amen this is the end the wheat has come back to the weed again the word has come back to the full word again the revelation has come back the son of man to the son of man again only in bride form what stumbles the people is the form he comes in it's not another person it's the same person hallelujah if the bride would be another person she wouldn't be his wife she wouldn't be bribed because this bride i'm coming into it and back in the church aces again showing where you were before the foundation of the world that ought to be enough to surrender that ought to be enough to submit yourself after we get through here i trust that god will show you what it means to submit yourself to the promised word for the season that you see your hour in your time and the and the time that he promised it would be here it's not publicly known everywhere it's known to his people his bride they're the only ones that could receive it i don't say who's this bride this is bright it isn't bride i'm just glad the revelation of it's in my soul but i am united with the people that know he's the same today as he was yesterday not another person she's not another person she is him in another form because it was always in him to be bride
