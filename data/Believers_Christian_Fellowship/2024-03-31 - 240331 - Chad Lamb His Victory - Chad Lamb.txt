========================================

now verse 10 but the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death they already wanted to kill Jesus because Jesus was exposing their system he was exposing their religion he was exposing the the the the the falseness of their heart and and he was exposing the whole thing and the people were going after Jesus and they were losing their in influence and for Envy they wanted to kill Jesus but now it wasn't just Jesus that they needed to kill but the one that he raised back to life is AAR too because now people are being attracted to the one who was raised back to life praise God let's read this again but the chief priest consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death because that by reason of him who Lazarus many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus what's the problem now the problem now is not just that Jesus is preaching the word exposing the the false Doctrine and the falseness of the church now there's one that's been called by name that's been resurrected to life that's come out of the system and now he's there testifying that Jesus is the Messiah testifying that the voice of the Resurrection is present and the life of the resurrection and the power of the Resurrection is present tense and now not just because of Jesus but now because of Lazarus many of the Jews amen are Believing on Jesus why is the resurrection power supposed to do today it's supposed to restore a bride back to her position why because she's now an attraction amen that's attracting the attention of the people and so people will come see her resurrected life and Believe on Jesus Christ that's what our life is supposed to produce we've been resurrected amen we've been resurrected out of dead denominationalism we've been resurrected out of the false understanding we've been brought back to the original life the original faith of the of the forefathers we've been back to the original life that came from Pentecost why was the life restored amen so that people could see there's a resurrection power on Earth today we don't have to live a compromising life we don't have to live a second rate Christian Life we don't have to have hypocrisy all around us there can be a genuine life lived for Jesus Christ there can be a real church just like there was in the first century that'll give all that'll believe the word that'll stay with it that'll manifest the life amen and that's an a attration that'll attract people to Jesus Christ now that becomes the threat right I don't know about you but I would like to be a threat to the kingdom of the devil lord I would like my resurrected life to be a threat not me cuz I have nothing but a life a resurrected life that seed of God that was laying dormant inside has sprung to life at the voice of the Resurrection we heard the call we've come to life and now it's his life in here manifesting itself
