praises to testify that you are alive and well you're living lord inside your bride bringing us Lord into a higher Place God I just pray that you would have your way with us this morning that you would take full control may you have Liberty Lord amongst us as we glorify your name in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you as you have your seats I be seated for just a moment man I just want to say it's good to be home we appreciate you all for praying for us we've had a wonderful trip and um I'm going to show you a few pictures just here in a moment so you can see where we were but first we've we've got a very special dedication we'd like to do so we'd like to invite the Barnes family to come forward if they would at this time Matt and Rachel Barnes if they'll bring their children to the front it feels so good to tell them to bring their children to the front as many of you know they had an adoption that was finalized on Thursday this past Thursday the 28th uh many of you were able to go we thank God for those who were able to go and celebrate with them but it's been a long year and a half there's been some ups and some downs and some trials but God knew all along what he was going to do amen God was never taken by surprise and we just want to say thank you to God as we dedicate these children to the Lord so these two came to them already named Ari was arah arah but they they gave her a new middle name Ariah Grace Barnes Ariah means Lion of God I think in this case it's lioness of God and Grace means favor and then Kai uh God dropped a name in Sister Rachel's heart one day and they changed his name to Malachi so he can still be called Malachi Paul Barnes Malachi means messenger of God and Paul means little or humble I say God bless you in your new names amen isn't God good amen man are we thankful for what God's done these two had a difficult start in life it wasn't so easy but God had a rescue plan God knew what he was going to do and so we just want to take a minute as a congregation to pray to together and dedicate these two children to the Lord so let's just pray let's just pray dear Lord Jesus God I thank you Lord for this little boy and this little girl God you've watched over them all the days of their life Lord through difficulty and through tragedy but God you had a plan you knew before the foundation of the world what you were going to do in their lives and we're standing here as Witnesses of your grace of your love and your mercy mercy and we want to say thank you for these little lives Lord if you were here you would take them into your arms and bless them but I stand here as your representative and I take them into my arms and I bless them in the name of Jesus Christ God may you watch over them as youve watched over them these first few years of their life you are so good and so faithful to give them a mother and a father that will love them and care for them God I pray that you'd watch over them from this day forward every step that they would take would you guiding a light be a on them Lord and may they never know what it's like to stray into the world and and Lord to be hung up and caught up in sin but may they always know what it's like to dwell in your presence to feel your presence may they come to you and give their hearts to you at an early age may they be filled with your spirit while they're still young may they live all of their lives in dedication to you Lord as you bless them we're so thankful for them Lord bless Malachi Paul Barnes with your spirit guide him Lord through life may he grow Lord to be a representative of you upon this Earth Lord I pray that you bless Ariah Grace Barnes Lord may she be a representation of you upon this Earth may you bless her all of her life and keep her and guard her Lord and may she grow to be a beautiful young woman Lord as long as time should T Lord may they stay upon this Earth in your presence in the center of your will may you guide them as a Shepherd guiding sheep God I pray Lord for Matt and Rachel may you give them wisdom Lord wisdom that's beyond their own wisdom understanding that's beyond human may you show them Lord how to guide these little sheep in this life's journey may give them strength Lord may you give them understanding may your spirit dwell in their home Lord and may the atmosphere be right for raising these children in the fear and ammonition of the Lord Lord you've given them a task lord it's a difficult task but Lord you can supply the spirit that can meet the need and we're asking you to do that in Jesus Jesus Christ's Name Lord give them give them everything that they need so that they can provide for these lives bless them Lord with more of your spirit bless them with more Revelation Lord may they commit themselves to you wholly and fully so that they can take these little lives that you've placed into their hands may they give them back to you Lord and may they give their lives to raise them right we love you father we thank you for this special day that we all get to participate in it and may your light shine through this family in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God

God is doing in our midst God bless you you can be seated again thank you musicians God bless you man I'm going to show you just a couple pictures I'm not really going to do a trip report this wasn't a missions trip this was more of a Ministry trip but I just wanted you to see where we were if you didn't know we were on the opposite side of the planet and so and it takes a long time to get there and there's a lot of flights so but um I got a picture here a satellite picture of Australia everybody lives around the edge of Australia nobody really lives in the middle there's just a few it's pretty much Barren but the edges are beautiful quite beautiful and so um in this trip I was really really blessed to get to travel with two of my favorite traveling Companions and so this was a rare opportunity and we were very very thankful that we got to go to together I'm especially thankful that God afforded me this privilege amen while I had the time to take it and it was it was a real blessing and you know we we drove up to Detroit and flew from Detroit to Los Angeles that's almost a 5H hour flight Los Angeles down to Sydney and that's almost a 15-hour flight and then we got on a plane and we flew an hour and a half up to Brisbane we got in a car and we drove about an hour to brother Daniel's place and uh then we stayed up all day and went to bed that night so by the time we laid down it had been like 50 hours since we had laid down but praise God he took care of us amen um this is a picture of brother Daniel we're on his back porch there just eating breakfast the next day after we were there brother Daniel and his wife Cheryl there all the way at the end and then he's got two deacons there and their wives so it was nice to get the fellowship with them a little bit this is a picture brother Daniel's Church you remember brother Daniel was here two years ago for November meetings and we had a wonderful time with him and so we've been talking about this for quite some time and it just worked out we had three meetings at his church uh and then Sunday there was two and we had a fellowship in between they've got a fellowship hall they got quite a nice facility and we thank God for what they have and while we were there the the girls got to meet some other young ladies and they had some fellowship so it was really nice they got to make some friends on the other side of the planet one thing that's we find that's a real privilege is that you know that's what I told him when we were there in Australia I said it's a privilege to get to meet brothers and sisters around the world because you know most people have to wait till the marriage supper but some of us are privileged to get to meet some of them in this life and I counted a great honor and a great privilege to have got to meet them and shake their hands and hug the brothers by the neck and there's going to be a great reunion someday and and we'll all meet but I'm so thankful we had this time here so we had quite a busy schedule I had quite a busy schedule I say we Loosely because we had the weekend meetings and then uh uh three services then I had one day to rest and then I flew out Tuesday down to me Melbourne but when I went to Melbourne the girl stayed behind for vacation and uh I ended up with eight services in N9 days plus 3 days of travel and so it was a lot uh when we went to m we we had there was another fellowship there another church and if you look at this picture all the way to the right is brother quazy and brother quazy is a minister he's originally from Ghana but he's an immigrant uh to Australia he's been a pastor for over 25 years there in Melbourne got a quite a nice church and we were really blessed just to the right of me is brother Eric and his wife Kylie they're the ones who hosted me I stayed in their home and they were wonderful host and we had a wonderful time there with them we had meetings Wednesday night and Thursday night there and it was a joint Fellowship everywhere was a joint Fellowship so they opened up the church for other believers in the area so it was quite nice it was a full house and we got to meet a lot of Believers and it was in Melbourne that I I had a sister come up to me and says um I think it was Melbourne it might have been Perth I don't remember now but anyways uh she said make sure you tell everybody in the church that they're a blessing to us so I said I'll be happy to convey the message they said the musician the song leaders the congregational worship all the ministers and they said even the prayer requests and testimonies are a blessing and so I said I will relay the message but they and she said make sure you tell them I said I'm going to tell them so I I've relayed the message but they were she was quite adamant that she was been very very blessed by you all so we had we had meetings there then Friday we flew over to Perth now if you don't know if you take Australia and you lay it over the United States it's roughly the same size so this is big this is a lot of flying it's like a four or five hour flight over to Perth so we flew over to Perth and when I got there I I met brother uh Michael there and we had we had another weekend meetings two on Saturday and one on Sunday right there at the end of the trip but while I was working the girls found something else to do playing with koalas and kangaroos I guess you can only do that in Australia but this is brother Michael he's originally from Zimbabwe but he's immigrated there and after that he became a pastor of the church there he's a wonderful brother and the wonderful Fellowship that they have there this is the church they don't have their own church they're actually renting off of a Pentecostal church so they they have their service at 1 p.m. on Sunday so we had two on Saturday they could rent the facility uh all day Saturday and then a 1 p.m. service on Sunday and it was while I was at this church um I just throughout the whole trip we kept getting text messages from you all and and and little messages little notes and I just want to say it was super encouraging I I appreciate every one of you for dropping us a note just sending something and it meant a lot to me uh especially since I lost my traveling Companions and I was all by myself in airports and to get a little word of encouragement was great but it was at this church I had two services on Saturday I was at the end of my preaching I already preached several services and I was just a little bit feeling a little bit wore out I had a little bit of a head cold and I went into the the little Pastor study the study between services and I was uh struggling with the second service and and just really seeking the Lord and feeling tired and feeling too tired to preach and I got a message uh I got a message from Brother John Brooks that said brother Chad you just came heavy on my heart and I'm praying for you and I looked and it was like 1:30 in the morning here and and I said how in the world did God wake him up or keep him up or I don't know to send that note right when I needed it the most in the whole trip I said God knows what he's doing and God works through his body I say God bless you brother John that was a huge encouragement to me and so I fired right back thank you brother I needed that and so we went and the Lord blessed the services he really blessed the services especially in Perth above all God really God really came down and he really did something Supernatural I had no idea of what was going on I had no idea really what to preach but God really changed my direction uh during that service and I preached unlike IID preached any other time that I was in Australia and God just redirected and it was just odd and it wasn't anything that I even really desired and I was going down a path and I didn't know why I was going down this path and I didn't necessarily want to go down this path like I would have rather preached on other subjects if I got to just pick but God just orchestrated it and and that was the way Saturday night and then Sunday morning the same thing I woke up and God just redirected and I was all tore up trying to sort it out but I eventually just I just submitted to the path that was going and not what I thought was best and not what I thought was most beneficial but just what was there and afterwards the pastor gave me a testimony and it absolutely floored me I had no idea how perfect God had orchestrated that service and it it it's not a man it's God because we have no idea what we're doing sometimes and it's not and it's not these bold things you know absolutely for sure what you're doing God spoke to me and I knew exactly this was for them I had no idea all I could do was move with those little nudges that God gives and the whole time you're second guessing and hoping it's working out right and praying amen and when you get to the end you find out it was perfect it just takes your breath away because the whole time you're uncertain the whole time you're trying to feel your way through it not knowing if this is right or not right and you don't know till the end and you can say thank God Amen God has been good amen so I just really appreciate your prayer support and I really appreciate this assembly and what you mean to us I've been longing to get back I've been excited to get back home and I'm so glad I could be here for Easter just to see you all and I appreciate all that you've done for us uh after Perth we flew back to Brisbane I spent a a day and a half or two days actually back there and then the girls and I flew back home and uh this is a sunset over Melbourne Bay we caught one night we were having dinner it was beautiful Australia is beautiful amen but I I've I've said many times the most beautiful the most beautiful place in every country I've ever been in is the Bride of Jesus Christ the most beautiful thing to see in every country in every country I've been to I may not always have time for sightseeing I may not get out and see some of the popular SES usually I go from a house or a hotel to a car to a church to a car to a hotel or a house but but by the grace of God I've seen the most beautiful sight in every country I've been in because I've seen God's bride and it's been a privilege and I thank God for it amen I just want to say thank you too to all the ministers who ministered while I was gone amen I had a chance to download the services and catch up as I was flying so I stayed right in Pace with the services and I just marveled at how beautiful it all was and perfectly it flowed and I just thank God for the gifts he placed in the body I thank God for the ministers that we have here each one of the brothers it was so nice to have brother Simon get to stay over and and preach on fishing from the right side of the boat I so loved that when he went down that path I said praise the Lord amen that's so good and and then uh brother Benjamin came and preached part two to that series he's been on in Pride and it was just so meaningful then Brother Kyle and brother Gabe and brother Emanuel wrapping it all up and I just want to say I really appreciate and love these brothers and I love their love for God and love for his word and the love for this assembly and the sacrifice they make amen they're they're Men of Integrity and men that I trust and I love them very much and I'm going to say God bless you Brothers you mean the world to us brother Kyle's not here today cuz he got invited up to Canada he's up in Ontario preaching for brother Dale longstaff or brother Dale langstaff and brother Dale langstaff is the pastor of Carson and Sharon uh Samson you remember Carson and Sharon were traveling down and visiting for us a while and they were looking for a church and God LED them to a church right near to their house and they're so happy there and that's where brother Kyle's staying he and his family are actually there with the samsons now and having good fellowship and they send their greetings back and and all is good and brother Kyle's taking the service there this morning so God is good amen we appreciate him I appreciate you all and thank God for him also I wanted to let Sunday school kids know that we didn't forget your candy so we the girls helped me get some candy for you and so after service if you go out to the FL you know where it's at on the table in the basket is some candy there may be enough for some others to have some but make sure the Sunday school kids get it first amen they get first rights they brought it for them but there should be plenty there everybody's welcome to grab a piece as you go and this is candy from Australia amen so you can enjoy the same or not the same but you can enjoy the candy that the kids your age enjoy on the other side of the world Amen God bless you let's stand and let's go to the word this morning let's turn to John chapter 10 want to say welcome to all the visitors that are here we're glad to have you with us and hope that you feel very welcome and comfortable amongst us may God bless you today let's go to John chapter 10 verse 10 the thief came not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and then they might have it more abundantly let's bow our heads and pray Lord Jesus we ask that Lord as we now turn our attention Lord to your word that you would come and break the bread of life to us Lord that you come open our understanding to understand your word Lord and open the scriptures to us that we might see you God I pray that you reveal to us Lord your your desire for us in this day that we're living and and Lord may we grow Lord by the food that you give us the good sheep food in due season I pray that you'd bless the ministering of the word Lord and bless the vessel that you use and God give us ears to hear and a heart to perceive all that you have for us this morning in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you as you have your seats amen Jesus came that we may have life and that more abundantly amen uh an abundant life and we thank God for that and we know that that Christ came and he he paid the price of redemption for us a price that nobody could pay because we were all sold in sin we were all bondslaves to sin we were trapped in hybridization but he came virgin born Liv the perfect life so that he could become a substitute for you and I and he gave his life and he shed his blood for our Redemption to pay the price of our Redemption amen but as Paul said if if Christ Rose not then we have all men are most miserable because we would know that we're free from the bondage of sin that the price has been paid but if there was no Resurrection there was no guarantee of our eternal life amen but he resurrected to prove that what he said was true and prove that he had victory over death now the curse of death has been broken amen and the resurrection is the proof of this and so we thank God Amen that we are free people amen free in every sense of the word free and you say well brother Chad we're still stuck in hybrid flesh oh that's only temporary friends we're free we've been free we've been purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ we've been set free and we've seen the we've seen the resurrection of Christ as a witness that sin's curse is broken death is broken and death has no hold on you and I he come that we might have life and life more abundantly amen amen he's restored to us eternal life so he is the god of resurrection and we believe that we are in the Resurrection season amen this is the resurrection of his bride this is the resurrection of his church and if we turn together to John 11 I would like to just read a little bit out of John 11 as we move forward says in John 11:23 this is The Story of Lazarus we know that Lazarus had become sick and a message went to Jesus Christ that your friend Lazarus is sick and Jesus delayed and he doesn't go and and he and he says it's good that he didn't go this whole thing has to play out according to God's desire but now he comes after Lazarus is dead and been buried and he comes in verse 23 and he says Jesus sayth unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha say unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day Martha begins to tell that she has faith in a resurrection she believes in a resurrection but she's believing in a future Resurrection she has faith in a res she knows that her brother will rise again in the resurrection so she believes the word she believes the prophets but Jesus doesn't want her just to have faith in a resurrection that's coming but he wants her to have faith in a present day Resurrection he wants her to go beyond just what everybody else understands but now he comes in verse 25 and he says Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection the resurrection then is a person amen the resurrection is not just an event we know that there's a culmination there's an event but the C the the resurrection is a person the resurrection is a life the resurrection is Jesus Christ he said I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this amen Jesus now is taking the resurrection that she believes in amen and he's and he's showing he's showing her a higher Faith he's showing her a greater truth than what she believes there's not a resurrection that's coming but there's a present Resurrection standing right in front of her and the power of resurrection and life is right there it's Jesus Christ the word made flesh the prophecy fulfilled he's standing there he is the resurrection he is the life and he said and and and he says he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live my goodness praise God he's not just talking about physical death he's talking about those of us who were born born Dead Come spiritually dead blind and alienated from God Amen we were separated from the things of God but if you believe in him though you're dead yet shall you be made alive there's a resurrection in this season right now because the person of the Resurrection is here the word amen the same word that was made flesh there is the same word being made flesh here and the resurrection and the life is present Resurrection Sunday is not one Sunday it's a life amen it's his life coming into US raising us from the dead the dead of separation from God and bringing us into life he says whosoever liveth I'm reading verse 26 again and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this and she said unto him yay Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of God which shall come into the world let's go down to verse 43 now he goes to the grave and he tells them to roll the stone away they find a stone placed over the grave and and it's amazing uh if I could just expound on this for just a moment this isn't really what I planned on doing but but praise God anyhow there's a stone that they've rolled over he died amen and he died because he had a sickness and that sickness was under death and and and they wanted Jesus to come to save him but Jesus wants to do something greater he wants to show Resurrection Life present tense they're all holding on to a future but he wants them to move from the future to today he wants to bring the res Resurrection present tense amen so he lets it Go and and now he he's dead and they they take and they wrap him in grave clothes amen what do they wrap him in gra they wrap him for death and then they Place him in a tomb which is what it's Stone that's been carved out by man and they take the stone that's carved out by man and they lay in the carved out rock that man is as as carved out himself and then they take a great Stone and they lay that stone over the entrance amen and we're going to see here it's a picture of denominationalism it's a picture of the church ages amen because they've taken the word and they've carved it out themselves but the man carved rock is for death not for life and then they placed him under the word amen and then they rolled the word on top of him their own Revelation why because the the denominational system that old system was what it was holding them down in death by what their own Revelation on the word they're making sure they stay in the manmade Rock grave but when Jesus Christ the word made flesh was present amen he was the resurrection and the life and he says roll that stone away move that false revelation of that false church out of the way amen we've got to move this out because I'm going to speak life back into this body amen amen and that's what's happened in our day when God sent a prophet amen they were rolling that false Doctrine and rolling that false understanding that man-made idea that man-made Revelation rolling it off of the Tomb amen why so that the voice of the Resurrection can hit and bring him out of that man-made system it's amazing how man uses the word to keep man under the word but God Amen when you when you look at PSAL I think it's Psalms is it psalms 27 that he used for the Rapture and he says amen thou has set me up upon a rock where does man put those in the church they put them under the rock but where does God put man God puts man on the Rock why he lifts him on the word he puts the word under him to lift him up and he said now is my head above all of my enemies why because he set me upon the rock he didn't put me under the rock to hold me down but this word elevated me above all of my enemies and put me on a firm foundation not for death but for Life hallelujah oh my goodness how could you not love this word how could you not love this message it's life friends it's everything it's everything to us amen they're not old Bible stories amen they're our life they're being fleshed out today amen Jesus said you roll the stone away he wasn't going to do this all by himself he had to have church involvement yeah amen you roll the stone away you move that false idea away you tell the truth amen that church and brother B said he told those women that's what the the prophet of God said he told those poor women to roll that stone away that's how brother Brenham said it he said why because the church has something to do in this you roll that stone away you remove that false idea you tell the truth but the church can't bring Resurrection Life right only the resurrection and life can bring Resurrection life amen amen we got a part to play but we can't bring life yeah right then then he speaks and it says in verse 43 and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth the prophet of God says he had to cry Lazarus because if he just cried with a loud voice come forth they would have all come forth but he said Lazarus come forth why it's the voice of the Resurrection amen he has resur he is the resurrection in life life so he's got to be specific Lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin Jesus saith unto him loose him and let him go the church has another part to play Jesus has his part nobody else can substitute nobody can bring life but the voice of the Resurrection but when he's come to life he comes out bound hand and foot all bound up he's still restricted in his movement he's alive but he's still tied down what's he tied down with with the old rags of denominationalism with old thinking old understanding false understanding of the Bible and he's all bound down he doesn't have the freedom to worship he doesn't have the freedom to move he doesn't have the freedom to express the life that's in him but he's telling the people that are around the church you loose him amen you take all those grave clothes off of him and let him go free amen cuz he's got the resurrection life amen so God is working and it and it's amazing it says he cried with a loud voice he said Lazarus come forth amen it was a specific cry to a specific one and in this day we've been told in Revelation 10 that the mighty Angels come down and he said the the the Covenant Angel The Mighty Angel amen with a rainbow over his head brother B said only Christ it could be he's come down with an open book in his hand and he cried with a loud voice what was that that's the voice of the resurrection and what's he calling for he's calling to his church for his bride to come out come out from among her my people and be ye separate he's calling for the resurrection of the Bride why because she was under the man-made Rock she was under the man's Revelation she was held down but in this end time there's another loud cry and it's the loud Cry Of The Mighty Angel it's the loud Cry of Christ when he comes with an open book and when it's the time for the unsealing of the book he cries as when a lion roar and what is that cry it's the voice of the Resurrection what's he resurrecting he's resurrecting his bride coming out of the Dark Ages restoring her back to her position amen that's the cry but oh God it wasn't for everyone it was only for those whose names were called brother B said he doesn't call the names like Orman Neville or Le Veil it's not that kind of calling but he calls your name as he's revealing the word as he's unfolding the Mysteries that's calling your name amen what does that mean that means as the prophet of God takes and now preaches the Seven Seals and unveils the Mysteries that were locked up through the church ages something in your heart says that's the truth that's the truth that's the truth others listen and walk away but you listen and say that's right that's the truth that's the Bible That's the Way It Is regardless of what I've been taught regardless of what I've thought all my life regardless of what my forefathers thought regardless of what generationally I was taught it doesn't matter amen I'm hearing a voice and that voice is preaching to me the truth of this Bible it may not sound like anything I've ever heard before but when I hear it something in me can identify that that's the truth what's he doing he's calling your name amen cuz not everybody gets that not everybody has a predestinated seat of Life inside that has the capacity to hear that voice and say that ain't nothing but the truth brother Brandon amen Millions here and walk away but there's a few who hear with a different set of ears ears of predestination and they can say oh my there was there was many people that were laying in the grave the day that Jesus cried with a loud voice but he called for one and he called Lazarus and in this day he's not calling everybody he's calling his bride it's a specific name he's calling Mrs Jesus Christ to come forth out of the systems and out of the denominations out of the hued out Rock Amen come out cuz he's going to put you upon the rock amen the rock of revelation of his word praise be to God and how do we know it's specific for me because I heard my name called well I didn't hear the pronunciation my parents used it's not your real name amen the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named Jesus Christ Christ when I heard his voice and I knew who was here in this day when I found out who was present and who was opening the seals and who was reading the vi of the Mysteries I heard my name amen that's what the whole family is named now let's go to John 12 let's go just a little further in this story John 12:1 then Jesus 6 days before the Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead if we go down to verse 9 we'll pick up the story there much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there and they came not for jesus' sake only but that they might see Lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead now now Jesus wasn't the only spectacle they wanted to see the one that was raised from the dead now there was there was uh uh more to the story we should say now verse 10 but the chief priest consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death they already wanted to kill Jesus because Jesus was exposing their system he was exposing the religion he was exposing the the the the the falseness of their heart and and he was exposing the whole thing and the people were going after Jesus and they were losing their in influence and for Envy they wanted to kill Jesus but now it wasn't just Jesus that they needed to kill but the one that he raised back to life is a target too because now people are being attracted to the one who was raised back to life praise God let's read this again but the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death because that by reason of him who Lazarus many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus what's the problem now the problem now is not just that Jesus is preaching the word and exposing the the false Doctrine and the falseness of the church now there's one that's been called by name that's been resurrected to life that's come out of the system and now he's there testifying that Jesus is the Messiah testifying that the voice of the Resurrection is present and the life of the resurrection and the power of the Resurrection is present tense and now not just because of Jesus but now because of Lazarus many of the Jews amen are Believing on Jesus why is the resurrection power supposed to do today it's supposed to restore a bride back to her position why because she's now an attraction amen that's attracting the attention of the people and so people will come see her resurrected life and Believe on Jesus Christ amen that's what our life is supposed to produce we've been resurrected amen we've been resurrected out of dead denominationalism we've been resurrected out of the false understanding we've been brought back to the original life the original faith of the of the forefathers we've been back to the original life that came from Pentecost why was the life restored amen so that people could see there's a resurrection power on Earth today we don't have to live a compromising life we don't have to live a second rate Christian Life we don't have to have hypoc y all around us there can be a genuine life lived for Jesus Christ there can be a real church just like there was in the first century that'll give all that'll believe the word that'll stay with it that'll manifest the life amen and that's an attraction that'll attract people to Jesus Christ now that becomes the threat I don't know about you but I would like to be a threat to the kingdom of the devil I would like my resurrected life to be a threat not me cuz I have nothing but a life a resurrected life that seed of God that was laying dormant inside has sprung to life at the voice of the Resurrection we heard the call we' come to life and now it's his life in here manifesting itself praise God there's a quote that I've been meditating on on that's got me thinking on this thought and it comes from Christ as the mystery of God revealed and and I will read it to you it says oh if I could get the world to see that why there you are there is the body of Christ Living standing redeemed redeemed oh my justified in his sight why are we Justified we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in the last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory listen to how many times he says his victory yeah whose Victory is this this isn't our Victory this is his victory listen it's it's not what we're doing it's what he's doing it's not what we've accomplished listen Lazarus had no power to raise himself from the dead Lazarus was dead he was dead and in the grave 4 days he begin to stinketh already according to his sister he's laying there in perfectly incapable of doing anything he couldn't raise himself he couldn't raise himself no more than you and I could raise ourselves but God has a predestinated appointment with Lazarus and it was the power of the Resurrection that raised him from the dead it wasn't Lazarus power Lazarus had no power Lazarus was just the one one that God chose to manifest his resurrected power in he was the chosen vessel that God would use to Manifest this Resurrection but he had no power to resurrect himself and we had no power to resurrect ourselves there's nothing we can do for ourselves friends but the power is in the voice of the Resurrection the one who's present the resurrection and the life that's Jesus Christ and he had he is the the resurrection and the life he is the power to raise the seed to life it's not us it's him we're just as helpless as Lazarus was but Lazarus had something inside of him that when Jesus called he could respond that when Jesus called he could get up he may still have been bound he may I don't know if he hopped out I don't know if he Shuffle stepped out I don't know how he got out of that grave but he was bound but something in him could respond to that voice anden it was there by predestination Lazarus didn't know it was there Lazarus didn't know it'd be resurrected Lazarus didn't know anything any more than you and I knew anything when we come to this life we were living whatever life we were living we had no power to do anything we didn't know that we were a chosen vessel to manifest the resurrected life of Jesus Christ we just thought we were Comm common human being like every other common human being but God before the foundation of the world had a specific purpose for Lazarus and he's had a specific purpose for you and I and he wants to manifest he's the resurrection and the life so now he says I'm going to go through some of this quote again but I want you to C catch the phrase his victory because this is his victory this is why it can't fail that's right there was no chance Lazarus was not coming up out of the Grave when Jesus come on the scene when Jesus waited 4 days he he knew what was going to happen when he delayed his return there was a purpose in it all when he got to the Grave he wasn't worried about what was going to happen he knew what was going to happen this was an appointment this is an appointment with Destiny this is predestination he knew there was no way Lazarus could miss coming forth and there was no way you and I could miss coming forth under this voice it's impossible we didn't know it he knew it we didn't decide it he decided it we were already dead in sins and trespasses but he came our way amen and somebody moved a stone away and we heard a call and when we heard the call there was something in us that could respond to the call because that was the purpose from the beginning God wanted a witness of the resurrection and Lazarus was that witness and now that witness became a threat to the system because they were coming to see one who was resurrected from the dead and they were believing in the one who resurrected him from the dead realize they weren't believing in Lazarus they were believing in the one who called his name and now people aren't believing in the bride they're not coming to us to say I believe they know there's nothing in me to believe in amen believe in the one who raised me from the dead believe in the one who gave me power by his power by his own Spirit to live a life I never was able to live on my own amen I was raised a Christian boy in a Christian home and went to church every Sunday of my life and every Wednesday my whole entire life and I wanted to be a good boy but I had absolutely no power to live the word and I found a cycle of Perpetual failure in my life but oh by the grace of God there was somebody who would tell me that old system is holding you down and they rolled a stone away and I heard the voice of the Resurrection in this message and it called me to life and by his power the resurrection power he resurrected me back not to what I was as a boy not growing up in a Pentecostal church he resurrected me back to my predestinated position back to what I was always intended to be a real believer of the word amen still stuck in a cur nature still making mistakes but there's another Power inside that's beyond the power of the Cocker nature that's beyond the power of the intellect it's the power of God I mean unto salvation that'll bring the life of God in our life that's the resurrection in the life and now that becomes the attraction why because where else is the power to live the word yes amen and when the church no longer has the power because they've left Christ they no longer have the power to manifest the word they change the word true because there is no power to overcome and to live as a Christian to live honest to live true to live humble to submit to the Commandments of the Lord because there's no power left there because the Holy Ghost has had to leave because they left the word now they start changing the word and now those things were for the apostles they don't count for us anymore that was for the church age we don't have to live by that anymore and what are they doing amen they're justifying the tombstone they're justifying the Stone they're justifying the death amen you know what they're justifying they're justifying the rot yeah amen of dead flesh right but we don't have to change the word amen the word is true it's always been true Jesus Christ spoke it it's been true if he spoke it to the Apostle Paul it's true it's always been true it always remains true and then that means it can be lived but it can't be lived by you God would never give a commandment that's impossible to keep the only problem is we can't keep it can't do it we can't we can't we can't overcome this flesh we can't do it so he made a mechanism where he could come and do it amen because he is the resurrection in the life and now the resurrection and the life can take up Abode that's what the whole purpose of the blood was he he purchased us with the blood so that he could sanctify us and that he could indwell us and it's Christ now in us living his own word amen it's the power of the Resurrection in a people today that'll actually live the Bible amen not in their own power and resurrection power so I want to read this again we are his victory the church is his victory do you know that when when you reject the false and take the true that's his victory right when you deny yourself and you take up your cross and follow him that's his victory because you didn't do that yourself there was another power that came in and gave you the power do you know that when when you submit to this message you submit to this word when you refuse to look at what you shouldn't look at when you refuse to say what you shouldn't say when you refuse to go the way of the world and you subject yourself to this word you know what that is that's his victory that's not your Victory that's his victory cuz you couldn't do it amen if it was left to us to have the victory there would be nothing but failure amen but the resurrection and life came in this day to dwell inside of us amen so that we could be his victory yes amen listen I I I don't know how to I I don't quite know how to share what's on my heart but if I could if God would just help me right now to share amen we get so beat down we get so beat up because of ourselves we get so discouraged because of our own flesh and the man in the mirror and the mistakes that we make and and we we we fail all the time and we get beat down to the point we feel like we're nothing we're just worms and we're and we're no good and we'll never amount to anything and in one sense of the word that's true but the problem is if you keep your eyes on that amen you're going to deny Christ his victory because he doesn't want you to be a beat down no good nothing worm he wants to come in you and he wants to have a victory in that flesh that flesh that's no good that flesh that's hybrid that flesh has fallen he wants to display to the world that he's got the keeping power that you can keep that you can live that you can Manifest this word it has to be on display somewhere that's his victory yes sir so many times we we get in the moly Grump so bad because we can't do it we fail listen stop looking at yourself and start looking at the word and start looking at who came in this generation and he's here what does he need he needs somebody who will surrender their life and say I'm done taking my thinking I'm done taking my ways I'm done trying to have it my way Lord I surrender all to you so that the Resurrection Life can come and manifest itself and that becomes the attraction to attract them to Christ that becomes the threat and that becomes his victory hallelujah it's his victory Lord I have no confidence in myself but I have absolute confidence I'll make it that's not confidence in myself that's confidence in his word left to myself I'll ruin it he didn't leave it to myself he didn't leave it to Lazarus he didn't leave it to Lazarus to resurrect himself to breathe Breath of Life back into himself he took care of that part we are his victory can't hardly get past that statement if there's anything that should make us sing and dance it's this we are his victory he is going to have victory in this day and that Victory is going to be in flesh and it's going to be in Fallen human no good flesh that's failed a thousand times but it's not always going to fail it's going to overcome it's going to manifest the life it's going to be a real genuine Christian because Christ is going to be on the inside making sure that he has his victory he's not going to be defeated God had his Eden Satan slipped in and through the woman he ruined God's Eden now Satan's built his own Eden so now God slipped in [Music] and through another woman he's going to restore destroy Satan's eeden it'll be him and her that Kingdom's coming down because Christ is here but he's where he slipped in unawares where's he at he's the resurrection and he's the life amen the church is his victory we come forth in the last days with the Glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this Purp purpose and we are proof of his victory amen when we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory shows that he he couldn't they couldn't keep him in the grave neither can they keep us and we're already potentially arise because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word from a denominational Creeds to an eternal word of the Eternal God which is him hisself working through US manifesting himself that he is the same yet yesterday today and forever amen what part of that can fail let me read that again amen he he's brought us from the unbelief in his word from the denominational creas to an eternal word of the Eternal God which is him hisself working through US manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever how can that fail amen it's him himself praise God am and when the word moves on down into the body from the head what is it the same word nothing can be added or taken from it so that same word moves from the head as the day comes close down into the body down uh down into the body vindicating that they are one they are husband and wife they are flesh of his flesh word of his word life of his life Spirit of his Spirit see amen how do you know it Bears the same record same fruit same word manifest Christ same life same God Same Spirit same word same book amen same signs the things that I do shall you also oh Hallelujah my notice the Vindicated word in his body is his victory and the reason of his death why did he die so that he could have victory in you so he could sanctify a bride so that he could come and dwell inside of it and here in the end time amen he can come and full measure because the full word has been restored and there's a purifying water to wash us from all the filth of the prostit and bring us back to that virgin condition when he was given a virgin fresh from Pentecost so why he could come and indwell so why he could have the victory praise God we we don't get credit for this one I'm thankful because if there's something I can do that would get me credit I'd be sure to ruin it praise God Ephesians 2:8 says for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves yes it is the gift of God what did you do well I believed well good for you how did you believe you were given a gift of faith well I I mean sometimes I I I I don't understand sometimes the way we say things I I I don't mean that anybody else I'm pointing at myself CU I don't like the way I've said things sometimes we tend to get a little bit hotty sometimes say well I believe every word well praise God that's his victory you had no capacity to believe the word by your brain you had no capacity by your human will it was a gift of faith that was given by Grace so we say well well I believe well good you you just proved that he had victory in you but we say it as if like we did something special well I'll tell you it's something special because it's so impossible for people to believe the word it is something special but it's his victory not ours says no man can come to me except the Father which has sent him draw him and I will raise him up at the last days hey we're in the last days you can't even come unless he draws that's right this isn't our will it's his will this isn't our doing it's his doing and it's not that we don't want him to do it we want so bad for him to do it but you can want all you want but without him wanting your want means nothing that's right it's got to be his desire that's his victory again in Christ as the mystery of God revealed he says he proves his resurrection life then as he vindicates himself she the bride is independent from all others she's an independent woman a Great Speckled Bird that different from all others you remember the Bible on that The Great Speckled Bird comes out of Leviticus says but she had his name she had his life how did they speckle the bird they were both white and then they pulled the head off of one bird and drained the blood out upon the other bird and the other bird was speckled with the red blood and it flopped its wings like this and the blood cried holy holy holy as it bathed the ground this was a sign that was given for the CL for the cleansing of leprosy which is the cleansing of sin leprosy is a type of sin and in the levitical order they would take take two Turtle does and they would take the head off of one and drain they take a mate and they drain the blood of one mate onto the other and it would spreckle it crimson and it would go flying and it would go free because the sacrifice of one freed the other the blood from one now was upon the other and the blood when the blood came upon the other the other could go free cuz one sacrifice for the free but as the Free Bird went it was testifying to the world that the blood is Holy Holy Holy unto the Lord it's sprinkling the blood which is the life of the animal because God said the life is in the blood the blood is given for the life so now that bird and he says now the Bride is a Great Speckled Bird he sacrificed his life he washed her in his own blood amen but now she goes free because of his sacrifice but her freedom is is a testimony that he gave his life and now his life is upon her and as she goes she's sprinkling his life all over the ground as she flies that's the purpose of the bird going free is testifying of the life of the dead bird amen what are we supposed to be doing testifying of the life of Jesus Christ the one who shed his blood for me his life now is in me his blood life is now upon me amen and it's supposed to be sprinkled off of me as I move in into this world and that sprinkling of the blood which is the life should be declaring holy holy holy is the Lord why because this is his doing that little pigeon had nothing to do with it amen that little pigeon was just the recipient amen it didn't have the power to cleanse itself it didn't have the power to set itself free it was bound but it was the dead mates life that set it free amen we had no power to set ourselves free we had no power to overcome but it was our m who gave his life for us that set us free and it's his blood that freed us and it's his life that's being declared in ours praise God says so Christ the dead mate put his blood his blood from his life sprinkled carrying his blood crying holy holy holy unto the Lord it's an odd-looking bird sure it is but she the bride is identified by him and she is independent from all others amen I love that statement she's identified by him because he put his life in her and she is independent from all others her dependency is not on an organization not on a system her dependency is not even on another human being but she is dependent only upon him let's go to Second Peter chapter 1 now I want to look at another aspect or another phase of this that we're speaking of second Peter chapter 1 second Peter chap 1 verse 2 second Peter yeah chapter 1 verse two Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of of of Jesus our lord according as his divine power ha given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness how did we get all things that pertain to life and godliness yes his divine power let's read that again according as his divine power hath given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness did you ever get it of your own power it was his divine power through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue what did he call us to glory and virtue amen praise God whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these what's these the precious promises ye might be be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this give all diligence add to your faith virtue and The Virtue knowledge the knowledge Temperance and the temperance patience and patience godliness and godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ let's go back to verse four now we know that this is the divine nature and the divine nature he begins to give us eight attributes of the divine nature with the eighth being love Godly love charity the capping Stone and when brother bam comes and preaches this he preaches it and the statue of a perfect man showing that this is the building up into the head in all things which is Christ this is coming to the stature of a perfect man unto adoption and so the divine nature is what we're growing into growing into Christ likeness and and he says here uh in verse four whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these the promises you might be partakers of the divine nature how are you going to be a partaker of the divine nature because he promised it to youen not because of your straining and your work and your labor and you're being a good boy and you're starting back at zero and climbing the ladder again and falling off it has nothing to do with that it's the precious promises that have declared it to you that's right right that by these the precious promises you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust I want to look at this world word partakers when I looked up the word partakers it means a partaker a partner a fellowship a companion a partner an associate a comrade a companion a partner a sharer in anything so what are we partakers our partners our comrades our companions in the divine nature well you mean we have a share in the divine nature yes we can share in the divine nature how by the precious promises according to his divine power has made it possible for us to be our partaker our participant or have a share in the divine nature that means God has ordained in purpose and supplied power that you will share in his divine nature it coming to adoption is not somehow you being able to work your way up or or being a good boy after so many years of believing the message you'll finally get it right and you'll finally come into adoption no you're going to come into adoption you're going to grow into all things into the head which is Christ you're going to grow in the stature of a perfect man why by the divine power that he sent and by the precious promises that's made you a partaker of the divine nature you have a share in it amen he he's already purposed it he's already promised it oh if we could if we could just take that to heart friends there's a share of the divine nature for me amen not because I earned it not because I deserve it not because I would there's a share I'm a partaker of the divine nature why because of the precious promises he made concerning me and because of the divine power that he supplied he's made me a partaker a shareer an associate a comrade amen a participant in the divine nature that means it's predestinated for me to be conformed into the image of his son to come into the stature of a perfect man to move into adoption in this day who supplied the power he did who gave the promise he did who wrote it in his word he did who's bringing it to pass he is you know there's times we fail we struggle and we say I'll never make it that's not true because he's already given his promise you're already a partaker of the divine nature you already have a share in it he wants to display his life in you and that's his victory listen we we all struggle every one of us fail every one of us are ashamed of ourselves and if you're not ashamed of yourself then let's have a meeting after church we'll see if we can do our best to help you be ashamed of yourself we'll get all your friends together in your family and I'm sure we can come up with enough stuff we're all ashamed of ourselves but we can't look at that because we'll always be discouraged but we got to look at what he's pointing us to and what his goal in our life is his goal is to bring us into perfect love into the Capstone his goal is to have his life reflected in US amen so that the Resurrection Life is seen in you and I that's his victory that's his purpose and that's the reason of his death amen his death is not in vain friends he didn't die in vain he didn't die hoping that somebody will finally achieve it he died knowing that you have a part in the divine nature he Divine knowing there's precious promises to bring you into that divine nature you may have to go around the stump a few times and you may have to bump your toe a few times but you're going to make it because it's his will that's stronger than your will if we could just look at that and be encouraged yes be ashamed of yourself but let that shame move you back into the word and say God I can't trust my thoughts I can't trust my feelings I can't trust what another human being tells me but I trust this word and by your power I know that I'm a partaker of the divine nature and I have a share in it and I'm moving towards that I don't know when I'll get there I don't know how I'll get there but I believe that I'll get there because remember friends everything in the kingdom of God is acquired by faith it's got to be Quicken to you that you belong there something in this word has to unlock something in you and say I'm not born to be an outcast I'm not born to be a second class I'm not born to always be a failure but he placed me here to be his victory so his victory can be in me and what a greater Victory than somebody that's dead and rotten and stinking yeah you say brother tell you don't know how bad I am praise God what a victory sir am we're all bad he's the one who's good that's why it's his victory not ours in the message live from 58 he says now the Christian church should have real character then I just love this if the Life of Christ is in the Church of Christ then it's got to have the character of Christ it'll Pro produce the Life of Christ it's just no more than just what we call in the South Common Sense if the life of the spirit of Christ Christ is in the church it has to produce that life because the life that's in you makes your character brother brenon made it real simple if the life of Beethoven was in me I would compose music because that's the life that's in me it made so simple but if the Life of Christ is in me then I'll keep the father's word because he kept the father's word amen not by my life but his life in me if toan's life was in me and I composed a piece of music I mean how much pride could I take in that it was the other life that was in me amen right it wasn't me praise God Amen but if his life is in me he'll keep his word because when he was here in flesh he kept his word and now he's coming back in flesh to keep his word cu the bride will stay on the word and the word alone amen by his power in the marriage of the Lamb he says I believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe in speaking in tongues but I think we lay too much emphasis on that a man can speak with tongues and a woman speak with tongues and if her life and his life doesn't compare with what the tongues you're speaking in then it's the wrong tongue cuz the holy spirit will make you act like the Bible it'll bring you to the fullness of the stature of Christ amen oh praise be to God now listen to what he says you take a person that speaks with tongues enough temper to fight a bustle and talk about the neighbors and everything like that why you call that the Holy Ghost it cannot be no sir the Holy Ghost is meekness joy peace longsuffering goodness gentleness patience Faith the Holy Ghost that's the fruit of the spirit that the Holy Spirit bears in the Church of the Living God's sweetness and humbleness humility love one for another and longsuffering it's not our power it's the power of the Holy Ghost but but we also can't be deceived in ourselves no matter no matter how many how many things we understand in the message and how much we've produced and how many testimonies we have amen that listen that Holy Ghost is to bring us into the stature of a perfect man amen right we can say I believe this and I believe that and I understand this and I understand that but enough temper to fight a buff stall and go around talk about the neighbors and gossip and backbite and all these other things no we've got something wrong amen there's something missing somewhere because the Holy Ghost that'll give you a revelation on the word is the same Holy Ghost making you a partaker of the divine nature so we got we can't get things discombobulated here we got we got to keep things in order we we we we may have an intellectual understanding of some few things but the reality has to be the life the life has to be manifest the life has to be lived there's no substitute for it yes he says again and that's and that's the way God does the church he beats every Creed every denomination every man-made Dogma until he sees his own life reflecting in you he's talking about the old gold smelter who used to beat the gold to get all the dross out of it until it becomes shiny and smooth and mirrorlike you can see his own reflection and he beat it and he beat it till he had his reflection in the gold and he's talking about that's what Christ is doing now to his church he's knocking out all of the world and knocking on everything that's unlike him until he can see his own reflection amen amen he says he sees his own life reflecting in you if I do not the works of my father believe me not see if what what is purpose what is purpose to the church the life that was in Christ isn't reflecting in you don't you stand still if you haven't got patience virtue all these things and Temperance and things and godliness and brotherly kindness and all these things that's required of you no matter what you've done no matter how much you shouted how much churches you've joined how many feathers you've pinned into yourself don't do it wait till genuinely from your heart you can forgive till in your heart you have brotherly kindness the reason I'm reading this is because I want us to recognize that there's something we're striving for there's something we're surrendering for the we don't want to get caught up in the wrong thing amen we're not here to manifest the most works in the world because there's other churches that can manifest Works amen but the works without the life breeds confusion amen we want the works but we must have the life we must have the the the stature of a perfect man we have must have the divine nature on display with all the works and the manifestations we're not what are the question is what are we looking for in our lives what are we hoping for what is our goal what are we Desiring to have happened or we are we're we're hoping to to have a great manifestation so that we can show that that did this and and and I I laid hands on them and they were healed and Hey listen there's all kinds of people in the world laying hands on sick and they're being healed it's happening friends all kinds of manifestations Amen but then deny the word and then live compromised lives and what's the point of raising the dead if you're embezzling money from a widow yeah so you rais the dead proving that you're a Christian but you embezzled money from a widow in the church proving that you weren't what is it if you can have a great campaign and you can heal all kinds amen but you're caught in fornication what needs to be underlying at all is the divine nature amen what God has promised for us and that's what we're striving for amen God will produce his own Works God will produce his own life but if we don't have that meekness and Temperance that's where we need to lay in prayer and say I don't need some big sign I need more faith I need more Temperance I need more patience in my life God come and take out this old nature and put your nature inside of me I need patience I need brotherly kind God I'm lacking in these things that you promised I can have and I'm holding on to your promise by faith that you'll put it in me but God I'm laying here on the altar saying I need the divine nature I need more Temperance in my life I'm I'm lacking control I keep falling into the same sins because I lack temperance it self-control God come and put your self-control inside of [Music] me I think many times we could get false hope in the wrong thing yeah I believe the message and I know God sent a prophet and where's the divine nature what I want more than anything in my life is for Christ to live in me if I never have a testimony to produce to prove to you as long as he puts in Me Faith and Temperance and patience and kindness and brotherly kindness and and love that's what I want the divine nature he'll take care of everything else nothing's going to miss a beat he's going to heal the sick he's going to deliver The Afflicted he's going to work signs and miracles because he promised that in his church yeah but what I'm striving for more than anything is to lay my life down and let him work his divine nature into me and I'm holding on to it by a promise God you promis this and I live in the age that it's going to be manifest I believe that how could we not believe that God already sent the prophet every end time sign has been shed amen this is the age when he's going to bring his church into the statue of a perfect man he's capping her off now with Divine love he's he's uniting himself the headship has come down to unite with the bride I this is the age for the manifestation I'm not going to be settled until I can see that life working in me and I'm going to stay on the Altar and keep climbing back on the Altar and saying God I want what you promised me Lord I need you to come and have your Victory inside of me what is it it's the res Resurrection in the Life what Resurrection amen the same life resurrected not a different life the same life what life the predestinated life the C Gene of God brother B says in perfect strength and by Perfect weakness so when I get everything out of me then God can come in but as long as I got some of myself there then God can't get in my listen carefully to this quote that's it we smother him out we drive him away that from the poorest of us to the richest of us from the least to the greatest we keep God out of our Lives because of our own selves that just floored me from the poorest of us to the richest of us from the least to the greatest we keep God out of our lives because of his our own selves brother Chad where did all that preaching go say it's his will he's going to do it's not you doing it don't forget that God never trumps free moral agency all he needs is a surrendered vessel and he'll do all the work amen all he needs is somebody that'll lay their life down even Jesus Christ had to go to Gethsemane and he had to wrestle with his own will and his own flesh until he could surrender it to God Amen amen even in the resurrection of Lazarus somebody had to roll the stone away and somebody had to unbind his grave clothes and in this great promise of the divine nature somebody's got to get themselves out of the way somebody's got to die to themselves and surrender Amen brother R goes on to say I've often said the greatest enemy I got is William Brandon he's the one that gets in God's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it if I'm guilty of anything it's all of the above and when he does that shoves God right out of the picture but when I can get rid of that guy when I can get to a place that he's out of the way then God can come over and do things that William brandham knows nothing about oh that's what I want I want to get to the place where he comes and do things I don't know nothing about you know nothing I've ever thought of you know it wasn't brother Brenham who thought of creating squirrels that was God who told him to do it God did something he didn't know anything about God did something he wasn't even planning for God come and did it by his own instruction amen what did that man need to do get out of the way what do I need to do get out of the way what do I need to do die to myself and we say that all the time die to yourself it's great it's great to die to yourself but sometimes God has to show you what part of yourself you need to die to I don't even know what to die to sometimes I know I need more death but what do I need to die to oh and then God and His grace will allow a circumstance to come up and you'll realize oh my goodness that's what I need to die to that's the thing that's still hindering me I need to lay down my wants I need to lay down my desires I need to lay down my self-preservation I need to lay down my self- protection what do we need to get rid of we need to get rid of self so he can come and have his victory yes what do we need we need less of me and more of him much much less of me said but when I can get rid of that guy when I can get to a place that he's out of the way then God can come over and do things that William brandham knows nothing about that's when God can use you that's when God can use any of you he can use anybody when we get out of the way but as long as we got ourselves in the way then we cannot you know what happens when you get yourself out of the way and God comes and does it you have no heart to take any credit for it you have no heart to steal his victory and hijack it and make it your own source of pride amen it's a shame that that's happened so many times God brings a victory and we hijack his victory we make it our Victory and we get puffed up and become proud because we had victory that we didn't win ourselves sometimes we just got to get ourselves out of the way so that Chad Lam's not even thought of so that he can come and do things that I've never thought of so he can come in you and do things that you've never thought of that's what I want I want I want like brother said I want to be standing near when he does those things am he says in looking unto Jesus he says I would like to say one thing just before we pray for the sick many people have the wrong impression about a gift a gift is not something that God gives you to go out and say here I'll go over here and pick out this and I'll take that and do this that's not gifts so many people think that but they're wrongly impressed a gift of God is just to know how to get yourself out of the way so God can use you that's all a gift is as long as you're in yourself didn't Jesus say himself the son can do St John M 5:19 verily very say unto you the son can do nothing in himself he passed by the pool that where all the cripples was and healed one man with prostate trouble or something a disease he said the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that doeth the son likewise it's not me he said that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works now you people sitting here there don't sorry now you people sitting out there don't you dare look to a man you look to Christ he's the one but he promised in the last days that he would manifest himself in human flesh like he did here at Sodom now your flesh My Flesh let us just open our hearts and get our own thinking away and just let the word take his course tonight in us then we'll see God's great gifts of his spirit manifesting before us what I want to do I want to get myself out of the way where I'm not even in the picture at all because I want this to be his victory I want it to be so much his victory that that you know when brother brandham comes to the end of the seals he says now don't say thank you to no man cuz no man did this he said I had no more idea what they were no more than nothing amen God just come to him day by day and gave him the Revelation and then he searched it out through the scriptures and he comes to the end of the seals and he wants you to know very clearly that that didn't come from his mind that wasn't him he had no ability to do that that was all God oh God let the Bride come to that position amen where we can be his victory it can be his victory in us where will it be in US absolutely but he's not going to share the glory with us we've got to get out of the way so he gets all the glory I can imagine Lazarus saying that was pretty neat how I rose out of the dead rose from the dead wasn't it come on I was just laying there thinking we were dead in sins and trespasses alienated from God our minds darkened to the things of God and God come and called us by name amen God put his Resurrection Life inside of us amen and then we can say well I just read the message and it made sense to me no God had a predestinated seed of Faith laying in your heart that he placed there before the foundation of the world and in due time he came along to your grave and he called your name and you came forth and now you're here to testify of his victory of his power you're here to testify that the resurrection power is on Earth today to resurrect a people to be what they were intended to be from Pentecost on the Pentecost come forth right but they failed before they made the destination but this bride is coming back to that condition not to fail but to move on and finish the journey amen why because of his divine power that's been given to make us partakers of the divine nature God is going to have the victory he tells he tells in Zachariah tells Z zerubabel not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord of hosts not by might nor by power you're not going to do this by Will you're not going to do this by self-restraint you're not going to do this by self-control amen it's going to be by a spirit what do we need we need a spirit but Jesus said to his disciples I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you that's the promise that's what Pentecost was all about listen Pentecost was not all about signs and wonders and all that that that comes with it that's the alc but it was all about Christ coming back to his church so I will not leave you comfortless but I will come to you and now when he came to them then he manifest himself in them remember remember Peter Peter was all Peter was Peter was a good example of us Jesus said you know the son of man's going to be betrayed and betrayed and he's going to be evily mistreated and killed and Peter says you're ruining everything people are hearing what you're saying why cuz Peter liked the campaign he liked the prestige he liked the position then when God comes down the the the time and and and he says far be it from you for a thing like that to happen and Jesus recognizes right quick he says he turns to him and says get thee behind me Satan for thou carest about the things that be of man and not the things that be of Goden and Peter didn't comes down a little further and and and Jesus says this night you all betray me betray me and he says uh or forsake me he says I'll never forsake you though all men leave the I'll not forsake you and he says you will before the Crow Thrice you'll deny me and he says though all men forsake Thee I he said I'm ready to give my life even prison even death for you that was Peter right you know Peter had to fail just a few hours from making that statement he had a damsel by a Fireside asking for the third time you're Galilean you're your your your your your speech betrayed thee and he began to curse and to swear and say I'm never knew the man a few hours after he said he'll go to prison he'll even give his life he'll never forsake Him and now he sees Jesus Jesus looks at him he runs out and he weeps bitterly he had to fail because if he had passed that test after what he said he would have got the victory yeah amen but God's going to make sure only one gets the Victory and it's going to be Christ now Peter goes to the upper room and he's a broken man he's defeated he's failed all of his strength all of his power all of his thinking is utterly failed he's been a failure and a public failure and everybody knows he's a failure that's such a good place to be I'd rather just get it out in the open now I'm a failure that's such a good place to be I'm a public failure but praise be to God he's going to come and he's said I'll not leave you com but I'll come to you now another Power another life another nature comes into Peter and by the power of the Holy Ghost Peter goes out a few days later and they go walking by a gate called beautiful and a lame man that was laying there and he looked at them and says Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give unto you in the name of Jesus Christ take up thy bed and walk and the man went running and leaping and worshiping in the church and they come to worship and to honor Peter and look at what Peter says Peter says don't look at us as though we have done anything to this man oh look at that change friends that's the change we need amen I want that change in my life right now don't look at me I didn't have anything to do with that that was God that was Jesus Christ and on his name and faith in his name has made this man whole don't look at us under our hands like we did anything we didn't do anything oh oh brother thank you for that I didn't have anything to do with it oh brother you're so it has nothing to do with me amen I had to get myself out of the way so that he could come and live his life so that if anything good is produced it's his life not mine mine's the that's got to get laid to the side my thinking's got to die my nature my wishes my wants I got to surrender all of them so his life can come and live his life that's his victory and the reason of his death said Christ is a mystery of God revealed he said it's not expressions of some church that we should Express something it's a life that you don't live yourself but he comes in you and lives by hisself and you become a prisoner to any human intellectual being at all you're led by the spirit oh praise God that's my greatest desire listen to this out of the rising of the sun there's just two more things I want to read as we close says no wonder he said fear not for now notice we are Redeemed by him and now risen with him that's what Easter means to the people risen with him notice now we have his spirit in us the abstract deed fully paid no you don't say well I hope I make it you've already made it that's how Faith speaks amen I hope I make it no you've already made it I'm just learning how to surrender yeah I'm just learning how to give up myself more and more day by day you don't say well I hope I make it you've already made it not I will make it I've already made it I never made it he made it for for me not me him well brother brandham they said I don't care what they say there he made it for me that's all I want I'm carrying about and I just want to see him manifested how can you do it call him down no he's in you see he's in you well then Lord if I can get myself out of the way you can manifest how can you do it because you ordained it so if I can just get out myself out of the way he can manifest how can I do it he ordained it so this is his victory and this is what he wanted to do and he can do it amen he will do it and where is he going to do it I'm volunteering for the job I believe he'll do it right here if I can just get out of the way last thing I want to read from the prophet in the unveiling of God he says he died to reveal himself to us now let us die to self to reveal him to others he died to reveal himself to us now let us die to self to reveal him to others why because if you die to self if you're dead then he's resurrected then he is the resurrected life living in you and he will reveal himself to others and you won't take a drop of credit for it this is his victory and the reason of his death are we going to make it absolutely by our own power absolutely not but by his predestinated plan will I grow into the stature of the fullness of Christ yes why because of the precious promises because of the divine power that he's gave to keep the promises and he's made me a partaker of the divine nature already before the foundation of the world am I I going to make it yes am I going to display Christ yes how am I going to get there I don't know but I know this has got to go out of the picture so he can come and be the picture it's Christ in Bride form that's the mystery that's unfolded today and that's where the light is shining why so that resurrected life can be an attraction to others just like Lazarus was an attraction to the world they come to see somebody that was dead and stinking yeah alive hey we were dead and stinking but we're alive in Christ Jesus not just alive but thriving under the hand of God thriving by the power of God manifesting this word with with healing with Deliverance amen with with manifestations of a man and manifestations of a woman and manifestations of a father manifestations of a mother and a and a household and all the things that God has placed in his word now living in flesh what is that that's an attraction of the resurrection and life and when they come to see Lazarus amen they saw Lazarus and believed on Jesus may they come and see his resurrected life in the bride and may they believe on Jesus praise God let's all Stand Together may God bless you in this Resurrection season praise be to God the church in the resurrection is his victory and the reason of his death God help me manifest your life all I can say is Lord I'm here God you know my heart you know my desires but I absolutely believe your promise I believe it do you believe it amen do you believe you're already a partaker of the divine nature do you believe that by the divine power that you're going to be conformed to the image of Jesus Christ I believe it too are we there yet I don't think I am but I'm moving that way by his grace day by day Surrender by surrender trial by trial bit by bit brother bam said you know what brother B said he said you know what it's going to take a whole lot of Shaving down for you and it's going to take a whole lot of Shaving down for me you know what we need shaving down you know what God's doing shaving us down you know what all these trials are for and all the it's a shaving down well praise God we're being shaved down you may say well brother Chad there there's a lot to shave down don't worry he's got a good Tool It's called The Sword of the spirit which is the word of God and it's a good shaving instrument and he knows how to anoint somebody to wield the sword to shave it down yeah I don't I know about you but in the last several Services I've been shaved down have you been shaved down you know what we might need more of more shaving down but oh God shave me down so that I fit into your M amen I don't want to try to do like the churches do and make you fit into my mold I want to be shaved to fit in your mold so that I reflect the life of Jesus Christ God if you got to shave me down shave me down if you got to reveal more of my failure to me so that I could surrender it Lord so that you can live then so be it but I believe that's the hour we live in and that's the time that we're here to be a real bride a real Church manifesting the life of Jesus Christ not manifesting it Sundays but Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday to manifest it at work and to manifest it when nobody's around and when you're driving in your car by yourself and when you're thinking your thoughts all alone that the same manifestation is there is here on Sunday that's a real Christian and that's what God has come to produce the his life in a many-membered body the reality of what a bride should be it's his work it's his victory he's determined to have it he's going to have it and I'm determined that to yield all that I know how and ask him to help me to yeld more so that he can have his way in me man let's bow our heads together Lord Jesus we're so thankful for your Resurrection Life God I'm so thankful that you sent a prophet in our day to bring the reality of the word God so that we're not reflecting on tradition not hoping in something that somebody else has said or somebody else has taught and we're hoped to write but God you've brought a reality down to each of us you've come yourself in this generation you're just as much here as you were the day you spoke to Lazarus and you're here calling names you're calling the names of your elected seed you're calling them to life Lord calling them out of the heu stone calling them out from under the rock so that you can place them on the Rock so that they can be secure and safe from all enemies this is the rapture season this is the Resurrection season and you are the resurrection and the life God we just want to surrender ourselves to you aresh God I want to put my hands in the air and say Here I Am Lord God your your Prophet David one time said search me oh God and see if there be any wicked way in Me God he was so willing Lord after his failure after he had fallen and then you restored him he was so willing to have you search his heart so that he never went that way again God help us to be willing to say search me oh God search My Heart Lord see if there be any wicked way in me Purge me Lord I want to lay my life down I want to surrender sometimes God I don't even know what to surrender to or from but oh with your help Lord I believe with all my heart you're drawing me to that position God live your life through these vessels bless your children that are here yielding to you today God may we be the lazarus' of this day may we be the present day Lazarus those who've been resurrected by the voice of the Resurrection those that have the Resurrection Life inside may we become something that the world can observe and a new spectacle something that takes them by surprise a real life a genuine life from the dead may they come and look to these lives and see you and be pointed to you and may they believe on you Lord Jesus we love you father we ask God that you'd have your way with us may your Resurrection Life live in each one of us and may we testify that Resurrection is not a Sunday once a year but Resurrection is a season that we're in Resurrection is a person and it's the person of Jesus Christ alive forever more more dwelling now in human flesh that's the resurrection that's going on now let it be real in each of us Lord let it be more real than me than I've ever experienced it Lord God I want more room for you to dwell inside of me I want less of me and more of you God I want to lay myself be and I want to move myself to the side I want you to take a greater possession of me than you've ever had Lord may you come in the Watchtower and may you direct all of my life I'm so tired of directing it myself I'm so tired of my own messes but but God I want you to take full control and have Liberty in me for I know Lord that in this body of Flesh will be your Victory because that's what you desire I want you to have it in me as I surrender to you may that divine nature grow in me and be on display I love you father I thank you for the promise cuz without the promise we'd lose hope but we have a promise and we're holding to that promise and we're pressing forward knowing that you'll not fail in your purpose in this end time but you're going to have what you called for we love you father we ask you bless those as we go Lord as we go to our fellowships to our families to our Gatherings God may we go with a determined desire to see you made alive in us to walk in the promise to believe it to hold on to it to confess it to watch it come to pass we love you God thank you for your voice of Resurrection in this day we give you honor and glorify your name in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and God bless you all it's so good to be with you today what a resurrection I think brother Ben quoted that quote I think from the rising of the Sun what a resurrection that was it was a glorious Resurrection it was a confirmation that death hold is broken and eternal life is restored to man praise God what a resurrection that was let us never forget it let us rejoice in it amen but let's not stop there what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is when Christ Is Made Alive in his body on Earth which is a many membered body what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is what we're witnessing is his victory praise God I think this is why the elders throw the their crowns at his throne what Crown did they earn what Crown did they win what what what Glory did we deserve what what victory did we win What battle did we win oh praise God you know the only thing we're fighting with is ourselves to surrender this flesh to him what a resurrection that was what a resurrection
