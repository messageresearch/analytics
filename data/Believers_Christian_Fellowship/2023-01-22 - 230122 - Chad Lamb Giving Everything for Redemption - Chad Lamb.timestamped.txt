[13:19] God I'm so thankful Lord that your
[13:22] presence is Among Us Lord we know
[13:24] according to your word that you've
[13:25] promised to be wherever two or three are

[13:29] now Lord we want you to take preeminence
[13:31] Among Us and find welcome in our hearts
[13:34] we love you Lord when we look into your
[13:36] word we pray God that you would open the
[13:38] word to us
[13:39] give us eyes to see and ears to hear all
[13:42] that you have for us in this hour may we
[13:45] grow by the things that you share with
[13:46] us today may we eat from your hand and
[13:49] grow we love you Lord and ask that you
[13:52] would take this vessel under your
[13:53] control for your glory in Jesus Christ's
[13:57] name we pray amen
[14:00] amen God bless you while you're standing
[14:01] you can turn your Bibles to the book of
[14:04] Philippians we'll get started in the
[14:05] word Philippians chapter 3 together
[14:09] and verse 4 Philippians chapter 3 and
[14:12] verse 4.
[14:14] though I might also have confidence in
[14:17] the flesh if any other man thinketh that
[14:19] he hath whereof he might Trust In the
[14:21] Flesh I more circumcised The Eighth Day
[14:24] of the stock of Israel of The Tribe of
[14:26] Benjamin a Hebrew of the Hebrews as
[14:28] touching the law of Pharisee concerning
[14:31] Zeal persecuting the church touching the
[14:34] righteous righteousness which is in the
[14:36] law blameness
[14:37] but what things were gained to me those
[14:40] I counted lost for Christ yea doubtle us
[14:43] and I count all things but lost for the
[14:45] Excellency of the knowledge of Christ
[14:46] Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered
[14:49] the loss of all things and do count them
[14:51] but done that I may win Christ amen God
[14:55] bless you as you take your seats
[14:57] well it's called the bless us as we look
[14:59] at his word this is a passage of
[15:01] scripture we know really quite well but
[15:03] the Apostle Paul here is starting to
[15:04] talk about you know some of the things
[15:07] that were in his past life that would
[15:09] give him confidence maybe some of the
[15:10] things that were either privileged
[15:13] positions or accomplishments uh in his
[15:16] own life and he started sharing that but
[15:18] but he says that he counted it all but
[15:20] lost it encountered it all but done that
[15:23] he might win Christ for him it was worth
[15:26] the loss of his reputation it was worth
[15:29] the loss of his Prestige or his position
[15:32] or his privilege the the wind Christ was
[15:35] worth the loss of all of that
[15:37] and we know Paul was called names Paul
[15:39] was chased Paul was beat Paul was he had
[15:42] all of these difficulties I mean we
[15:45] don't even know some of the details in
[15:47] his life the rejection may be in his own
[15:49] family uh maybe siblings or parents or
[15:52] or who knows extended family the
[15:54] rejection that he went through the old
[15:56] friends that separated from him we don't
[15:58] know what it cost him but one thing we
[16:00] know for sure is it cost him
[16:02] it cost him but he he thought the cost
[16:05] was worth it amen and Paul redeemed the
[16:09] the the the to win Christ worth the loss
[16:11] of it all he says verse 17 but what
[16:14] things were gained to me those I counted
[16:16] lost for Christ
[16:18] yea doubtless and I count all things but
[16:20] lost for the Excellency of the knowledge
[16:22] of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[16:25] suffered the loss of all things and do
[16:27] count them but done that I may win
[16:30] Christ Paul wasn't trying to hold on to
[16:34] his life and have Christ
[16:36] he wasn't trying to keep one foot in
[16:40] Both Worlds at the same time in the
[16:42] church world and in Christ so that he
[16:45] could go to whichever one's convenient
[16:46] or glean the benefits from both
[16:49] you understand what I'm saying but he
[16:52] made a commitment and he made a decision
[16:54] and he moved amen everything that he had
[16:57] and everything he was he moved into one
[17:00] path and that was towards Christ and in
[17:02] doing so he lost everything else
[17:05] and for him it was worth it
[17:08] and so yeah this morning there's just a
[17:11] lot of thoughts in my heart a lot of
[17:13] things that I've been dwelling on in
[17:15] usually you know we'll think of a title
[17:17] or some title and I know people like to
[17:19] write a title but I have no idea the
[17:21] title amen
[17:22] I'm sorry for that I just and you know
[17:25] you do this hundreds and hundreds of
[17:27] times and things but today I'm so full
[17:29] and we're just going to trust God I'm
[17:31] just going to relax myself and and drop
[17:33] into another channel into another gear
[17:35] and just let God flow amen and whatever
[17:37] he wants to do he'll do and at the end
[17:39] whatever we think we should call it
[17:41] we'll call it that amen and you can call
[17:43] it something on your paper and I may
[17:44] call it something different on mine but
[17:46] it's the word of God Amen
[17:48] in the message influence brother Adam
[17:50] said God is only trying to find one
[17:52] person he can get his get in his hands
[17:55] he has always tried to do that you
[17:57] notice all down through the Bible when
[17:59] he found in Isaiah when he found a
[18:01] Jeremiah when he found a Samson one day
[18:03] but Samson gave his strength to God but
[18:05] he gave his heart to Delilah see
[18:08] you've got to give your all to God your
[18:11] reverence your respects your everything
[18:13] that you are just be nothing just see
[18:16] how little you are and that's what God
[18:18] wants us to do and that's real humility
[18:20] amen real humility is just to give your
[18:22] all to God Amen real humility is not to
[18:25] act humble
[18:26] and and
[18:28] you know I'm not really preaching on
[18:29] humility but it's a theme that pops up
[18:31] and what we're looking at uh real
[18:34] humility there's a false humility and a
[18:36] false humility is a false a basing of
[18:39] yourself and making comments about well
[18:41] I'm nothing and you know that I'm
[18:42] nothing and I and and I'm no good
[18:45] anyways and and but you know that may be
[18:48] true and that may be genuine humility
[18:50] you really view yourself that way but if
[18:52] you you say those things but yet there's
[18:55] parts of your life you're not
[18:56] surrendering to the word you're actually
[18:58] not humble you're proud
[19:00] because real humility is a submission to
[19:03] the word of God when you recognize that
[19:06] there's nothing I think of value but the
[19:08] word has all the value amen my ideas are
[19:11] not valuable real humility is a proper
[19:13] placing of yourself
[19:16] so real humility is not saying
[19:18] self-abasing statements you can say
[19:21] those statements and not be humble at
[19:22] all
[19:24] but genuine humility is not about the
[19:26] self-abasing statements genuine genuine
[19:29] humility is about an absolute
[19:32] understanding of where you stand in the
[19:35] program of God and that you and I'm
[19:38] talking you on The Human Side now I'm
[19:40] talking the natural side that in you is
[19:43] no good thing in in your thinking your
[19:45] understanding your Concepts your
[19:48] feelings they are all utterly failed
[19:51] they will they're they're contrary many
[19:53] times to the things of God cannot be red
[19:55] light upon cannot be trusted so I will
[19:58] surrender all of this for the word
[20:01] and then subject myself to the word
[20:04] that's true humility
[20:06] even if you don't make all the
[20:08] self-abasing statements
[20:10] even if you don't walk around saying I'm
[20:11] no good and I'm nothing and and I can't
[20:13] do anything right I mean you you don't
[20:15] have to say any of that humility is a is
[20:18] a full surrender to God
[20:21] amen and so that's just part of what we
[20:24] want to look at but I want to go to the
[20:25] Book of Esther now if we could go to
[20:27] Esther chapter one
[20:28] and we've preached so much on Esther but
[20:32] I still think there's more to preach I
[20:34] don't know I think the word of God is
[20:36] layered and eternal and will never come
[20:39] to the end of it amen
[20:42] Esther chapter 1
[20:47] and I want to read verse 5 and then jump
[20:49] over to 10 I just want to set a
[20:51] background here as we move forward
[20:53] but in uh Esther chapter 1 verse 5 and
[20:58] when these days were expired the king
[21:00] made a feast into all the people that
[21:02] were present in shushan the palace both
[21:04] under the Great and Small seven days in
[21:06] the court of the garden of the king's
[21:08] Palace so he has a seven-day feast and
[21:12] the seven day Feast is is in the court
[21:14] of the palace and let's jump over to
[21:16] verse 10.
[21:18] and on the seventh day when the heart of
[21:20] the King was married with wine he
[21:21] commanded mehuman and bistha and harbona
[21:25] and big and
[21:27] abagatha zether and carcass the seven
[21:30] chamberlains that served in the presence
[21:32] of hazarus the king to bring vashti the
[21:35] queen before the king with the Crown
[21:37] Royal to show the people and the
[21:39] princess her beauty for she was fair to
[21:42] look on but the queen vastly refused to
[21:45] come at the king's commandment by his
[21:47] chamberlains therefore was the king very
[21:49] Roth in his anger burned in him
[21:53] so we see that that now we come to the
[21:55] end we we have a seven day Feast which
[21:57] is a type of the seven Church ages and
[21:59] and on the seventh day of The
[22:02] Seventh-Day Feast amen he sends seven
[22:05] chamberlains amen which are which are
[22:07] the seven uh let's type that as the
[22:09] seven Messengers The Seven Angels amen
[22:11] and when we saw that cloud all seven
[22:13] were in the cloud amen so on the seventh
[22:16] day he sends the seven chamberlains amen
[22:18] or or we look at it this way in fullness
[22:20] these sins the seven chamberlains to
[22:23] come and bring vashti the queen and then
[22:25] vashti is a type of the the
[22:27] denominational Church world and vashti
[22:30] refuses to come to the king and the
[22:32] seventh day of this great feast
[22:35] which is exactly where we are in time
[22:37] Amen in the seventh Church age God has
[22:40] sent all seven chamberlains after amen
[22:43] his church after the bride amen but the
[22:45] formal Church refused
[22:48] refused and so let's go to chapter 2
[22:50] verse 1.
[22:56] chapter 2 verse 1.
[22:59] after these things when the Wrath of the
[23:01] King azerus was appeased he remembered
[23:04] vashti and what she had done and what
[23:06] was decreed against her then said the
[23:08] king's servants that ministered unto him
[23:10] let there be fair young virgins sought
[23:12] for the king
[23:14] and let the king appoint officers in all
[23:16] the provinces of his kingdom that they
[23:18] may gather together all the fair young
[23:20] virgins unto shusha and the palace to
[23:22] the house of the women and to the
[23:23] custody of hege the king's Chamberlain
[23:26] Keeper of the women and let their things
[23:28] for purification be given them and let
[23:31] the women which pleases the king be
[23:33] Queen instead of ashti and the thing
[23:35] pleased the king and he did so so we're
[23:39] so very familiar with this story we
[23:40] won't go into great detail but now he
[23:43] sends out servants and those servants
[23:45] are out there to gather all the fair
[23:47] young virgins and it just goes to show
[23:49] that many are called but few are chosen
[23:52] and they're coming in at the time Amen
[23:55] to replace vashti the whole point is the
[23:57] church the formal denominational church
[23:59] has turned down the call of the king in
[24:02] the seventh day
[24:03] but now they're saying go get virgins
[24:06] amen those that are undefiled go get
[24:09] Fair young virgins and he sent the
[24:10] servants out to call The Virgins and now
[24:12] there was going to be a purification
[24:14] process and at the end of the
[24:16] purification process there's going to be
[24:18] a presentation to the king and the king
[24:20] is going to make his selection the one
[24:22] that pleases him is the one that he's
[24:24] going to choose and now we we've got the
[24:27] whole stage set for our life
[24:30] for where we are amen because we we know
[24:33] that we're in the day that the formal
[24:34] church has refused the call of the king
[24:36] in the seventh day the seven
[24:38] chamberlains have come the seven spirits
[24:40] of God have come amen the message
[24:42] through seven Church ages has come amen
[24:44] and she has refused but God is is
[24:47] looking for that one that he's going to
[24:49] call bride
[24:51] and so now they were gathering the fair
[24:53] young virgins but there was a purpose in
[24:55] the Gathering he was looking for a queen
[24:58] he was looking for his Queen amen the
[25:01] vashti thought she was Queen but she she
[25:03] Dishonored herself and was not worthy of
[25:06] that title amen and now
[25:08] the king is looking for a queen he's
[25:11] looking for a bride he's looking for a
[25:13] wife
[25:15] so this whole process is about him
[25:17] looking for a wife
[25:19] now let's go to verse 12.
[25:23] now in every maid's turn was come to go
[25:26] into king ahazarus after that she had
[25:29] been 12 months according to the manner
[25:30] of the women for so were the days of
[25:33] their purification accomplished to wit
[25:35] six months with oil of myrrh in six
[25:37] months with sweet odors and with other
[25:39] things for the purifying of the women
[25:42] then thus came every Maiden into the
[25:44] king whatsoever she desired was given
[25:47] her to go with her out of the house of
[25:48] the women into the King's house
[25:51] and in the evening
[25:53] in the evening she went and on the
[25:55] morrow she returned into the second
[25:57] house of the women to the custody of
[25:59] shash gas the king's Chamberlain which
[26:01] kept the concubines she came in unto the
[26:04] king no more except the king delighted
[26:06] in her and that she recalled by name
[26:10] now when the turn of Esther the daughter
[26:12] of ABBA Hale the uncle of Mordecai who
[26:15] had taken her for his daughter was come
[26:17] to go into the king she required nothing
[26:20] but what haggai the king's Chamberlain
[26:22] The Keeper of the women appointed
[26:24] and Esther obtained favor in the sight
[26:27] of all them that looked upon her so
[26:30] Esther was taken into King azerus into
[26:33] his house Royal in the tenth month which
[26:35] is the month tibeth in the seventh year
[26:38] of his Reign and the King loved Esther
[26:40] above all the women and she obtained
[26:42] grace and favor in his sight more than
[26:44] all the virgins so that he set the Royal
[26:46] Crown upon her head and made her Queen
[26:49] instead of vashti
[26:50] and the King made a great feast unto all
[26:53] the princes and his servants even
[26:54] Esther's feast and he made a release to
[26:57] the provinces and gave gifts according
[26:59] to the state of the king
[27:02] all right there's so many things in here
[27:04] that I want to talk about that we have
[27:05] talked about and I'm sure as we read
[27:07] through this your mind is being pricked
[27:08] of all the things that we've drawn out
[27:10] of this in the past but I want to I want
[27:12] to take a look at this and show where
[27:14] we're at because when when when these
[27:18] fairy young virgins are called like I
[27:19] said many are called if you were chosen
[27:21] here are many are called amen but one is
[27:24] going to be chosen
[27:26] and now it becomes uh that this is kind
[27:29] of a Do or Die situation
[27:31] they're all gathered together and and
[27:34] you know I don't know if the Gathering
[27:35] was of their free choice or against
[27:37] their free choice I I don't know what it
[27:39] was that day but but you can imagine
[27:41] when the decree goes out that the that
[27:43] the king is looking for another queen
[27:45] and all the fairy on virgins should come
[27:47] you can imagine how many people were
[27:49] standing first in line for that
[27:51] how many young virgins in the Kingdom
[27:54] wanted to be in that call amen wanted to
[27:57] go and and wanted to be wanted to have
[28:00] her chance to become the next Queen and
[28:02] so they were sent messages sent out they
[28:04] were gathered to shushan the Palace they
[28:06] were given to the custody of haggy the
[28:08] king's Chamberlain which is a servant of
[28:10] the king and that King that King's
[28:12] Chamberlain now is appointing them the
[28:14] things that they need for purification
[28:16] because they can't go straight to the
[28:18] king until they first been purified amen
[28:20] and gone through our haggy eye amen
[28:22] through through brother Branham has
[28:24] given the water of the word for
[28:26] purification
[28:28] to purify us to come to the union with
[28:30] the King amen so they go through a
[28:32] purification process and and this is a
[28:35] 12-month process and as they're going
[28:37] through that I don't know exactly what
[28:40] what Hagee I was telling them but he was
[28:42] giving them the appointments and the
[28:44] instructions and everything that they
[28:46] needed for purification and I'm sure he
[28:49] was giving them instruction even to
[28:50] approaching the king and etiquette and
[28:52] procedure and because these women were
[28:54] gathered from throughout the the kingdom
[28:56] they weren't raised in Royal palaces
[28:58] they weren't raised in shushan the
[29:00] palace they were gathered from the
[29:02] kingdom so no doubt he's giving
[29:04] instruction on an approach to the king
[29:06] the proper Approach To The King and
[29:08] conduct and Order and Doctrine
[29:13] amen
[29:14] you got it
[29:17] so now they're going through this
[29:19] process but but as they're going through
[29:22] the process
[29:24] they all know that only one
[29:27] only one
[29:30] is going to be the queen
[29:34] and
[29:36] and you know how the Apostle Paul says
[29:39] we all run in a race but not run as one
[29:42] that's untrained or undisciplined but I
[29:45] run that I may obtain the pride all run
[29:48] but one gets the prize
[29:50] so run the race therefore that you might
[29:53] obtain the prize Paul is giving this
[29:55] instruction amen that that there's going
[29:58] to be if there's only going to be one
[30:00] person get the trophy that day you run
[30:02] the race like you're the one who's going
[30:04] to get the trophy amen and he's tying
[30:06] that to serving Christ amen and that's
[30:09] how Paul served Christ he gave up
[30:11] everything else and he was going to get
[30:13] a hold of Christ and hold on to Christ
[30:14] regardless if demons forsake Him
[30:16] regardless if he was going to be stoned
[30:18] or chased by the Jews or rejected by his
[30:20] countrymen he was going to he was going
[30:23] to have Christ regardless of what else
[30:25] he had to lose
[30:27] is that right
[30:28] so so and he's instructing us run the
[30:32] race amen run the race to win the race
[30:35] don't run the race to be in the race
[30:39] uh I I just I hope I just pray God help
[30:43] me to relax myself and just let it flow
[30:46] amen it's not to say I'm in church or
[30:49] I'm in the message or or I'm I'm
[30:52] following after the ministry of William
[30:53] Branham you run this race to be the
[30:56] bride amen not to be in church not to be
[30:58] in the message not to be associated with
[31:00] Ruth right amen we've got the we've got
[31:03] to run differently amen this isn't a
[31:05] church race this isn't a church walk
[31:07] this isn't a social event amen this is
[31:10] my opportunity to come in contact with
[31:12] the King and be chosen to be his bride
[31:17] like this is do or die this is all or
[31:19] nothing this is halfway is no good
[31:24] so many women I don't know how many
[31:26] women there was 127 provinces if they
[31:29] took one from every Province it'd be
[31:30] 127. if they took a few from every
[31:33] Prophet I don't know how they selected
[31:35] that but there was a number of women
[31:39] and you know you know Human Nature
[31:43] I mean you live in it you're surrounded
[31:46] by it
[31:47] if you're not awakened to it just open
[31:49] your eyes it's all around you
[31:52] you take that many Fair young virgins
[31:54] who all have one chance to be the the
[31:57] queen and I wonder if there was any
[32:00] competition
[32:03] I wonder if there was any jealousy
[32:07] I wonder if there's any Strife I wonder
[32:09] if there was any gossip
[32:13] probably not these were all perfect
[32:16] people you know
[32:19] I wonder if there's anybody trying to
[32:21] get an advantage
[32:23] over another
[32:26] I wonder if all these very young virgins
[32:29] who had the Ultimate Prize to win
[32:33] do you know what second place was
[32:36] The House of the concubine
[32:39] where they all got stuck
[32:43] and maybe never ever ever come into the
[32:47] presence of the King again
[32:51] so it it's not
[32:55] yeah we're all going to be happy we're
[32:57] all gonna we're gonna see the king
[32:59] together no one of them was
[33:02] they were all going to see the king but
[33:04] one of them was going to be chosen one
[33:06] of them and so now you can see how how
[33:10] when it comes to uh the appointments for
[33:14] purification the instructions of haggai
[33:17] you can see how critical it was to pay
[33:20] attention to what he was saying to
[33:22] listen and and and try to understand and
[33:25] when he goes through the purification
[33:26] you want to be there in the purification
[33:29] process you may be one of first one done
[33:32] right I'd like to be the first one done
[33:34] I want to be the first one to go in I
[33:36] want to get extra credit I want to set
[33:38] the state no I don't want to go first
[33:40] because you know first you can't make
[33:41] his decision I want to come somewhere in
[33:43] the middle
[33:45] can you imagine all the scheming
[33:49] that was going on and I'm sure haggai
[33:52] was buttered up to more than any other
[33:53] human being on the face of the Earth at
[33:55] that period of time he had 12 months of
[33:58] of all those women telling him he was
[33:59] wonderful
[34:01] they all wanted an advantage I say oh
[34:04] they may not have all been that way but
[34:05] if human nature holds true
[34:08] that was there
[34:09] it was present
[34:12] but but I love some of the statements
[34:14] that we read in the scriptures
[34:16] it says
[34:17] now
[34:21] um let me go back here and find it
[34:24] verse 12. let's go back to verse 12.
[34:28] now when every maid's turn was come to
[34:30] go into king ahazarus after that she had
[34:33] been 12 months according to the men of
[34:35] women who skipped on down
[34:37] the verse 13 then thus came every Maiden
[34:41] to the king whatsoever she desired was
[34:43] given her to go with her out of the
[34:45] house of the women unto the King's house
[34:48] so after 12 months of purification and
[34:51] instruction and time with haggai they
[34:54] were they were permitted to take
[34:56] whatsoever they desired with them to go
[35:00] and that was how they were going to
[35:01] present themselves to the king so
[35:03] whatever a dormant they chose
[35:05] headdressing perfuming well I don't know
[35:07] what the I don't know what all was laid
[35:09] out for them but it says whatsoever they
[35:11] desired
[35:12] was given to them and you can see now
[35:16] after 12 months in this position with
[35:19] the stakes being so high and human
[35:21] nature being what it was you can see how
[35:24] people could these women could easily
[35:26] start injecting their own ideas amen and
[35:29] not just do what everybody else is doing
[35:31] I don't want to go just exactly like
[35:34] haggai says because if everybody I I
[35:37] want some Advantage I'll do a little
[35:39] extra bow here and a little extra color
[35:41] here and a little extra Flair here and
[35:44] before realizing it she was adding to
[35:46] the instructions of haggai
[35:49] she was adding to or taking away she
[35:52] might say well that looks boring if
[35:54] everybody goes in I need to do this and
[35:56] I need to do that and and we know Esther
[35:59] didn't go that way instead of Esther she
[36:01] only took that which is appointed to her
[36:03] she required nothing but what was
[36:06] appointed to her by haggai the king's
[36:09] Chamberlain she trusted the king's
[36:11] servant because she knew that if anybody
[36:14] in the room knew haggy I knew
[36:18] and I'll tell you the same thing if
[36:20] anybody amen if anybody at the end time
[36:23] knew what the king likes it is brother
[36:25] Branham amen if there's anybody who had
[36:27] a relationship and an understanding of
[36:29] the word it is he who understood what
[36:32] the king wants what he desires what he's
[36:34] looking for what he's going to attach
[36:36] himself to and Esther had more character
[36:39] than all of them because they were all
[36:41] allowed to take whatever they wanted but
[36:43] she had enough uh humility
[36:47] to say I don't know
[36:50] I don't know what the king wants I've
[36:53] never been she may have never been in
[36:55] the palace she may never been in the
[36:57] presence of the king she may have never
[36:58] laid eyes on him before but she had
[37:01] enough sense to know that I'm just going
[37:04] to do exactly what haggai says and and
[37:07] the other woman may think that's boring
[37:09] that's not nice enough that's to this or
[37:11] that's not enough of this and they were
[37:14] dressing it up let's say Amen to
[37:16] impressed the king
[37:19] and maybe not just to impress the king
[37:21] because then as the atmosphere of
[37:23] competition
[37:24] intensifies
[37:27] I wonder how many times they were trying
[37:29] to outdo each other
[37:35] human nature never changes
[37:39] Christ is here uniting with the bride
[37:42] that bride is being purified by the word
[37:45] she's being prepared to come into a
[37:48] union with Christ by the washing of the
[37:51] water of the word
[37:53] and and we still have free more latency
[37:55] we can present ourselves to Christ any
[37:57] way we want
[37:59] we can add a little this and add a
[38:01] little that but I wonder how many times
[38:03] we're trying to impress the king or how
[38:05] many times we're trying to impress one
[38:07] another or outdo one another with our
[38:09] spirituality or with our gifts or with
[38:11] our this
[38:12] I wonder how many churches are trying to
[38:14] outdo another church or how many
[38:16] families are trying to outdo another
[38:17] family or how many sisters are trying to
[38:19] outdo another sister or brothers or
[38:21] brother and being spiritual and more
[38:23] spiritual and having more Revelation and
[38:25] and a a greater this and a greater
[38:27] Ministry and a greater
[38:31] has times really changed
[38:35] amen and all of a sudden the the
[38:37] atmosphere we it becomes conducive Amen
[38:42] to to competition and doing a little
[38:45] better and presenting myself and what
[38:47] are we trying to do amen all of a sudden
[38:49] we're trying to get advantage over one
[38:51] another Amen to get favor of the king
[38:53] and in these girls minds they believed
[38:55] that they were going to get favor of the
[38:57] king but Esther went in there not
[38:59] promoting herself not promoting her
[39:01] gifts not doing anything extra she went
[39:04] in there exactly according to the way
[39:06] haggy I told her she had true humility
[39:09] they all presented themselves in Pride
[39:11] she came in humility because she only
[39:14] required what was appointed by haggai
[39:19] she didn't have to spice it up flare it
[39:21] up she didn't have to pump it up she
[39:23] didn't have to program it up she didn't
[39:25] have to gift it up
[39:29] you see the wrong conception the wrong
[39:32] perception amen that somehow I have to
[39:35] make myself more attractive to God
[39:37] Esther was not going in there relying on
[39:40] sensuality she was not going in there
[39:42] relying on on on her her I don't know
[39:46] what else I mean she wasn't going in on
[39:47] her Charisma she wasn't going in on her
[39:50] style she wasn't going on her gifts she
[39:52] wasn't going in on sensuality which is
[39:54] natural things she was going there by
[39:57] what haggy I had appointed and she
[39:59] followed the instructions of the king's
[40:01] Chamberlain and when the king saw her
[40:03] she was different than the rest and
[40:05] immediately she found favor with him
[40:09] we do not have to make ourselves more
[40:12] presentable to Christ by by flaring
[40:15] things up and styling things up and
[40:17] pumping things up and working up gifts
[40:20] and working up music and and having the
[40:22] best of this and the greatest of that
[40:24] and being better than this or better
[40:26] than that amen that that is the carnal
[40:29] side of church life amen and that's not
[40:32] what we want I want to know what that
[40:34] Prophet taught amen he knows the mind of
[40:37] Christ and is brought to us in this age
[40:39] through that gift and I want to present
[40:41] myself that way
[40:43] and what was that presentation amen it
[40:46] wasn't using my gifts to impress God
[40:48] God's not impressed with gifts
[40:51] not trying to impress God with my
[40:53] preaching not trying to impress God with
[40:55] my singing not trying to impress god
[40:57] with how many people I prayed for amen
[40:59] that doesn't impress God what God is
[41:02] looking for is somebody that will just
[41:04] obey his word
[41:06] that's what he's been looking for that
[41:08] was what was wrong with vashti vashti
[41:10] probably had tons of gifts we noticed
[41:12] that she was extremely beautiful
[41:15] she may have had Charisma and etiquette
[41:18] and refinement she may have had likely
[41:20] she did she was a king in the palace she
[41:22] may have had all of that so the king
[41:24] rejected that because she wouldn't keep
[41:27] his word
[41:28] so the king's not looking for more of
[41:31] that he's looking for something
[41:33] different than vashti
[41:35] and all of the women around are
[41:38] continually trying to present themselves
[41:40] like vashti
[41:44] I can do a little better for myself than
[41:46] that
[41:47] and and when it really comes down to it
[41:51] when I mean when we get down to the core
[41:53] of it
[41:56] these women went in a way that pleased
[42:00] themselves
[42:01] when we just get down to the core of it
[42:04] that's what they thought was beautiful
[42:06] they thought was attractive they thought
[42:08] would be pleased
[42:10] and oh if a church can't be guilty of
[42:13] the exact same thing
[42:15] if we as Believers as individuals that
[42:17] we can be guilty of the exact same thing
[42:19] of trying to present ourselves to God in
[42:23] really a way that we like
[42:25] we enjoy that we think is great
[42:29] but Esther didn't do that
[42:33] brother Branham says in the marriage of
[42:34] the Lamb that Esther was to become a
[42:37] bride so she didn't want none of that
[42:39] adorning of the world she wanted to go
[42:40] in through the king just like she was
[42:43] she adorned herself like the Pentecostal
[42:45] women ought to with Meek humble spirit
[42:47] and when all these fancy first ladies
[42:50] come by with all their newfangled thing
[42:52] Fang dangled things the king looked at
[42:54] them and put them in the chamber with
[42:55] the concubines but when Esther came into
[42:58] his side and he got a glimpse of that
[43:01] sweet humble Meek Spirit he said that's
[43:03] her go get the crown and put it on her
[43:06] head that's it
[43:08] all right again in marriage of the Lamb
[43:11] it says Esther perched her heart before
[43:13] God walked up with a Meek and humble
[43:15] Spirit the church that's going to be the
[43:17] bride of Christ now remember Esther
[43:19] refused the worldly adornment she took
[43:22] the spirit in her heart to go before the
[43:24] king
[43:25] and the women today the church that
[43:27] thinks she's going to get in because
[43:29] she's got more numbers she's the best
[43:31] dressed crowd she's got the biggest
[43:32] organization the biggest church in the
[43:34] city and things like that you'll miss it
[43:36] a million miles if you're depending on
[43:38] that
[43:39] it's a sweet reverent Spirit to the word
[43:42] of God
[43:44] Washed by the Water of the word and the
[43:46] word in you
[43:47] how do I present myself Amen to present
[43:50] yourself to this King Christ the King
[43:52] Amen to find favor in his eyes amen is
[43:55] not to to attach not to present your
[43:59] gifts not to not to work anything up but
[44:01] just come humbly reverent to the work
[44:04] that he's given us in this day and
[44:05] you'll get his attention you'll find
[44:07] you'll find favor in his eyes because he
[44:10] hasn't for for thousands of years been
[44:13] able to find the people amen that'll
[44:15] just stay with the word as he gives the
[44:18] word
[44:19] they're always wanting something more I
[44:21] mean he gave him a land they wanted a
[44:23] king and uh I mean we just on and on and
[44:25] on we find the things that that happened
[44:28] down through the Bible and down through
[44:30] the church ages amen they're always
[44:31] trying to to make it something better
[44:34] something flashier something more
[44:36] presentable amen but but Esther came
[44:38] down to a Do or Die moment she's either
[44:40] going to be the queen or she is going to
[44:43] be in the concubines house
[44:46] and friends we've come down to do or die
[44:49] this is not church churchianity church
[44:52] one this isn't I I'm going to church and
[44:55] we're all going to be bride this comes
[44:57] down to an individual level amen you're
[44:59] going to come into the presence of the
[45:01] king and you're either going to be a
[45:03] concubine a church member or you're
[45:05] going to be bride
[45:08] and and it's sad to say but I wonder how
[45:12] many concubines are around
[45:18] they've had an experience with the Lord
[45:20] they've had an encounter with the King
[45:22] each of these concubines had an
[45:24] experience with the Lord they had an
[45:26] encounter with the King
[45:27] is that right they had an encounter but
[45:30] remember brother Branham said you can
[45:32] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[45:34] die and go to hell
[45:35] because it was only on the spirit it
[45:38] wasn't on the soul it wasn't a new birth
[45:39] it wasn't bringing a seed to life but it
[45:41] was the same Holy Ghost
[45:44] not a different Holy Ghost it was the
[45:46] same spirit of God you came in contact
[45:48] and had an experience with that spirit
[45:50] of God Amen but you were never conceived
[45:53] on the word the word never conceived in
[45:56] you you didn't become bride wife of
[45:58] Jesus Christ you had an encounter an
[46:00] experience amen
[46:05] encounter with with a supernatural God
[46:08] but that's not it you can have that
[46:10] experience and still be a concubine
[46:15] and sit in church the rest of your life
[46:23] go into the house of the king
[46:26] go into the inner chamber
[46:28] have an experience with the King and
[46:30] then the king sends you to the house of
[46:32] shash gas
[46:34] and you still go and all of your pride
[46:36] thinking I was still the best presented
[46:38] I still did what was right I and all of
[46:41] my ideas are still right
[46:46] but there was a humble one among them
[46:48] named Esther
[46:49] and she wasn't jogging for his position
[46:52] she wasn't vying for first place in
[46:54] anything she was just submitting to
[46:56] Hagia haggy I said this haggy I said
[46:58] that haggy I put me here I gave me this
[47:00] guy I said this
[47:03] and listen friends I don't want you to
[47:05] get the notion one drop that I think a
[47:07] legalistic attachment to the prophet is
[47:10] going to get you anywhere because that's
[47:11] still the wrong understanding
[47:13] Esther had to pick up more than just
[47:16] drop this perfume here and wash this
[47:19] water here and he did she had to pick up
[47:21] more she had to catch the picture behind
[47:24] it amen she had to catch what the king
[47:26] lied amen because now she has to go to
[47:29] the king without haggai and he's not
[47:31] standing over her shoulder saying turn
[47:33] right turn left smile slightly now tilt
[47:35] your head to the right amen no she had
[47:37] to go by herself into the presence of
[47:40] the king and in order to present herself
[47:42] right when Hagia is not there she has to
[47:45] catch she has to catch the understanding
[47:47] of what Hagia is trying to get her to be
[47:50] haggy is trying to get her to be that
[47:53] certain kind of woman to carry herself a
[47:55] certain way to present herself a certain
[47:58] way to be purified by a certain
[48:00] purification amen and Esther could catch
[48:03] the lesson that was lost on the rest of
[48:05] the women they were going through the
[48:06] motions there may have been women who
[48:08] were more legalistic
[48:11] than Esther
[48:14] if haggai says three drops of this in a
[48:17] bath and two drops of that and we you
[48:19] may have had people with one
[48:22] two
[48:25] three four oh drain all the water
[48:28] he said only three drops
[48:33] Esther may have been going there one day
[48:35] one two three four oh okay
[48:39] Point wasn't
[48:41] exactly
[48:43] following every word the point was
[48:47] understanding why this ointment purifies
[48:50] you
[48:52] how why you must be purified before you
[48:56] meet the king why you have to spend 12
[48:59] months why why you have to carry
[49:01] yourself a certain way what the king is
[49:03] looking for what the king wants Esther
[49:05] had to catch more because the the the
[49:08] the woman who could legalistic follow
[49:10] everything that haggy I said
[49:13] is going to end up derailed when
[49:15] haggai's not there and she comes into
[49:17] the presence of the king
[49:19] and the King asked her a question that
[49:21] wasn't on the flash cards
[49:26] and the King puts her in a situation
[49:28] amen that wasn't in the textbook
[49:31] do you understand what I'm trying to say
[49:33] this isn't legalism this is a respect
[49:36] for the Chamberlain this is a respect
[49:37] amen for the servant of the king who
[49:40] knows what the king is looking for and
[49:42] now I'm not looking in the mirror I'm
[49:44] not looking at the other women I'm not
[49:46] looking at the world and what Fashions
[49:48] are outside of sushi and the palace I'm
[49:50] looking at that King's Chamberlain
[49:52] because I know he understands what the
[49:54] king's looking for he knows what went
[49:56] wrong before and he knows what the king
[49:58] wants and I'm looking at him to try to
[50:01] understand
[50:02] the why behind it all
[50:04] [Music]
[50:07] because he's not going with me into the
[50:10] inner chamber
[50:11] I'm going there alone it's not about me
[50:14] and Hagia in Christ it's about me and
[50:16] Christ
[50:18] and I I can't always go to cue cards and
[50:21] I can't always go to textbooks amen now
[50:23] I have to get the lesson that was
[50:25] learned in the school and I have to
[50:27] understand the application of the life
[50:31] and Esther embodied
[50:34] what haggy I was trying to do
[50:37] Esther became the the the purified
[50:41] virgin ready to be presented to the king
[50:45] because she was willing to Humble
[50:49] herself
[50:50] and drop all of her own ideas
[50:54] and forget about what she knew before
[50:56] and forget about what everybody else was
[50:58] saying
[50:59] and just pay attention to the one who
[51:01] really knew
[51:05] you know
[51:07] we there's no way you you're ever going
[51:10] to get anybody
[51:12] that knows this message to confess
[51:15] that they're doing what the other
[51:16] virgins did
[51:18] but we do it all the time
[51:20] we really have to be honest with
[51:22] ourselves
[51:23] we've taken our own ideas so many times
[51:25] we we've didn't we didn't really
[51:27] understand why Rhythm said that we
[51:30] really didn't understand why he made
[51:32] that a requirement or he taught it that
[51:34] way and and there's been so many
[51:37] attempts to explain or or or or or uh
[51:41] explain away even sometimes statements
[51:44] that were made but in my mind it's
[51:46] that's not the point my point is I want
[51:48] to understand why he said of course I
[51:49] don't understand it it doesn't make
[51:51] sense to me but there's a reason behind
[51:53] it amen and I want to know the mind of
[51:55] the king I want to know the one that I'm
[51:58] coming into Union with I want to know
[52:00] all about him and this man's been there
[52:03] knows his mind been given instruction
[52:05] from the king I want to understand why
[52:07] he said that
[52:09] but there's so much explaining away
[52:12] there's so much uh uh taking our own
[52:16] ideas
[52:18] oh God help us
[52:21] Proverbs 18 12 says Before Destruction
[52:24] the heart of man is haughty
[52:26] and before honor is humility
[52:29] but the man says over and over the Way
[52:31] Up Is Down
[52:32] the the all of these things
[52:35] but
[52:38] I don't oh my
[52:41] I'm going to look at second Kings
[52:42] chapter 9 verse 30. I just want to look
[52:44] at one verse there
[53:05] Second Kings 9 verse 30. we know the
[53:08] destruction of ahab's house now is
[53:10] coming in order according to the
[53:11] prophecy of Elijah and jehu is the agent
[53:14] that God is using for that it says and
[53:17] when jehu verse 30 when jehu was come to
[53:19] Jezreel Jezebel heard of it and she
[53:22] painted her face and tired her head and
[53:25] looked out a window
[53:27] amen this word tired her head it's
[53:31] shortened version of a tired
[53:33] it means to be good be pleasing be well
[53:36] be glad to be glad be joyful to be well
[53:38] placed
[53:40] so what did Jezebel do when jehu was
[53:43] coming in judgment to judge amen the the
[53:46] and the in the false in ahab's
[53:49] house and all of that according to the
[53:50] prophecy what did she do she she did
[53:54] herself up I guess it's the easy way she
[53:57] put her face on
[53:59] she got her hair done up she you gotta
[54:02] retired she set the ornaments whatever
[54:04] she did amen she did something because
[54:07] somehow she was of the understanding
[54:10] that I can use my appearance I can use
[54:13] my beauty I can use my class or position
[54:16] my gifts or whatever I can use that to
[54:20] appease the wrath of God
[54:22] I can appease jehu and jehu represented
[54:25] the wrath of God I can use my beauty my
[54:27] Prestige my ornaments my gifts my all of
[54:30] that and I can appease that is exactly
[54:33] what the false Church thinks she says I
[54:35] am in no Widow and in need of nothing I
[54:37] mean she believes that she's beautiful
[54:39] that she's not destined for destruction
[54:41] and that her beauty and her gifts and
[54:43] her abilities amen can somehow amen stop
[54:47] or persuade or appease the wrath of God
[54:49] and jehu paid no attention to the
[54:52] painting of their eyes or the tiring of
[54:54] her head or anything that she tried to
[54:56] do to present herself a certain way to
[54:58] jehu he stopped she looked out the
[55:00] window he said is there anybody in there
[55:01] on our side and there was a eunuch there
[55:03] that pushed her out the window and she
[55:05] died
[55:06] none of those appeasing things are going
[55:09] to appease the wrath of God
[55:11] none of those gifts and the talents and
[55:13] and beauty and adornment and the church
[55:16] is going to appease the wrath of God God
[55:18] is looking for one thing and one thing
[55:20] only and that's those that will keep his
[55:22] word
[55:24] that'll humble themselves
[55:26] to the word of God
[55:29] brother Graham says
[55:31] and the message be not afraid to desire
[55:33] from 1960 says some people think
[55:36] humility is something that ought to wear
[55:38] a skirt
[55:39] meaning it's weak and it's feminine and
[55:42] it's
[55:43] that's what brother Graham says he says
[55:45] some people think humility is something
[55:47] that ought to wear a skirt no no you
[55:49] misunderstand that Jesus the humblest
[55:51] man that ever lived he could play a
[55:54] ropes together and look on them with
[55:55] anger and run down to the tip run them
[55:57] out of the temple yes sir certainly
[56:00] so humility is not weakness
[56:03] humility is not an inability for Action
[56:07] amen humility is actually a surrender to
[56:10] the word and will of God
[56:12] humility would move somebody to action
[56:15] humility would move somebody to be firm
[56:17] or take action or move brother or move
[56:19] Jesus to make a whip and drive the money
[56:22] changers out because he was zealous over
[56:24] the house of God
[56:26] so you can see humility is not this
[56:28] weakness there's a lot of boldness
[56:30] sometimes involved in humility because
[56:32] when God requires it humility will
[56:34] subdue my own feelings and take God's
[56:36] word and move in a bold way
[56:40] this is what what Esther had to do
[56:46] if I could
[56:49] if I could reinforce in your heart the
[56:51] strength by which it's in my heart
[56:53] I would
[56:57] that all of these women
[56:59] were under the ministry of haggai
[57:03] and they all were given things for
[57:05] purification they all had access
[57:08] to some of the same things
[57:10] the same same ointments and same
[57:13] perfumes in the same processes and same
[57:16] Foods they had they all had
[57:19] and they were all going to meet the king
[57:24] if if I could just
[57:27] God will just help me
[57:30] in some ways it would have been safer to
[57:35] not be called
[57:37] and stay in the province
[57:40] and marry and raise children and have a
[57:43] family
[57:45] understand what I'm saying
[57:47] they're calling and bringing into haggy
[57:50] eyes
[57:51] Ministry
[57:53] and to the appointment of women into the
[57:55] house of the women
[57:56] when they were called into this position
[57:59] now only one is going to be selected to
[58:02] bride
[58:03] they've come to the most critical
[58:05] Junction of their entire life
[58:08] and the rest of their life all of life
[58:11] depends on this
[58:14] and they can't make the king do anything
[58:18] they have no control over the king they
[58:21] can't make him decide one or the other
[58:23] he will decide the one that pleases him
[58:25] that's the criteria he will choose the
[58:27] one that pleases him and so now these
[58:30] women have been called and I'm sure at
[58:33] first it was very prestigious because
[58:34] they were only calling the fair young
[58:36] virgins they weren't calling polluted
[58:38] women corrupted women had to be virgin
[58:40] first so that was honorable title then
[58:42] they had to be fair and they had to be
[58:44] young so in order to fit that title you
[58:47] already knew that one of the king's
[58:49] servants thought that you were beautiful
[58:51] young and virtuous
[58:54] so there's a great honor and there's a
[58:56] great Prestige and maybe some pride that
[58:58] went along with being called amen and as
[59:01] they're called I'm sure there's
[59:01] excitement to coming in and coming into
[59:04] the the palace and to the house of the
[59:06] women and I'm sure it was beautiful and
[59:08] there was many things to see and many
[59:10] things to learn and as haggy I would
[59:12] begin to present amen all about the
[59:15] palace and the court and court order and
[59:16] all the things about the king and his
[59:18] history and his background and the royal
[59:20] family I'm sure there was a lot of
[59:22] excitement and enthusiasm
[59:26] but can you imagine what it was like to
[59:28] be one of those 40 50 100 200 300 5 000
[59:32] I don't know how many women
[59:34] and realize
[59:37] only one
[59:39] only one
[59:41] is going to be clean
[59:43] the rest of us are going to be regular
[59:45] old-fashioned church members
[59:50] one of us is going to be the bride
[59:53] the rest of us are going to be church
[59:54] members
[59:56] I say that intentionally for a reason
[59:59] so that we can get this down in our
[1:00:01] hearts
[1:00:02] we've been called into the ministry of
[1:00:04] haggai we've been separated out as Fair
[1:00:07] young virgins and brought to an
[1:00:09] appointment with the King but they
[1:00:10] actually entered into the most dangerous
[1:00:12] place in their life
[1:00:16] they actually moved into a place that
[1:00:18] was Do or Die
[1:00:20] that was church member or bride that was
[1:00:24] the concubines or the wife they actually
[1:00:27] were put into a position where there was
[1:00:29] no turning back there was no retreat
[1:00:31] there was no way out
[1:00:34] and and it's a privilege to be called by
[1:00:37] God to the message in this hour it's a
[1:00:39] privilege to come amen it's a privilege
[1:00:42] to hear the things and learn the things
[1:00:43] and sit under the ministry of haggai
[1:00:45] Amen but it should become more serious
[1:00:48] to us that this is do or die I'm either
[1:00:50] going to be a church member in the
[1:00:52] message or I'm going to be bride
[1:00:54] not just because I come into the house
[1:00:56] of the women not because I've heard the
[1:00:58] teaching of a haggai not just because
[1:00:59] the the things I heard and enjoyed and I
[1:01:02] saw the beauty and Grandeur of it all
[1:01:03] but no there's there's going to be a
[1:01:06] selection process and I can't make the
[1:01:08] king do anything he's going to do it of
[1:01:10] his own choosing by what pleases him so
[1:01:12] now what is it that I'm going to do how
[1:01:15] am I going to be pleasing to the king
[1:01:17] how am I going to be that bride amen and
[1:01:20] Esther comes to this position and so do
[1:01:22] these other women but it motivated the
[1:01:24] other women to make themselves more
[1:01:26] attractive and more acceptable but
[1:01:28] Esther had the humility to say there's
[1:01:31] nothing I can do other than what's been
[1:01:33] given me
[1:01:35] and Esther can you imagine uh I'm sure
[1:01:39] Esther probably wasn't the first one and
[1:01:42] others had went and they always all the
[1:01:44] women are eager to get the report back
[1:01:47] and the house of the women so so sister
[1:01:49] so and so went what happened oh she went
[1:01:51] to the house of shash gas
[1:01:55] next one okay he hasn't made a selection
[1:01:57] yet and can you imagine each one of
[1:02:00] those women is his third time to walk
[1:02:03] into the inner chamber for her encounter
[1:02:05] with the King
[1:02:06] she's going to come out of there forever
[1:02:09] different
[1:02:11] she'll either be a church member or
[1:02:13] she'll be a bride
[1:02:18] I don't think that it's just me I don't
[1:02:21] think that that place was
[1:02:23] a place of flipping light-hearted
[1:02:27] but I think for each of those women
[1:02:29] there was contemplation there was
[1:02:30] self-reflection there was a tension
[1:02:36] because if they weren't pleasing to the
[1:02:38] king they went to the house of the women
[1:02:41] if they were pleasing to the king they
[1:02:43] were the next Queen
[1:02:45] and each one would maybe I I don't know
[1:02:49] what they would do so just if you allow
[1:02:51] me just to dramatize based off Human
[1:02:53] Nature
[1:02:55] each one as they leave the house of the
[1:02:57] women they go to the big mirror all the
[1:02:59] way around you know it's perfect to tear
[1:03:02] everything's I've got the jewels I got
[1:03:03] the it's all here
[1:03:05] they ask the other women you know how do
[1:03:07] I look is everything fine which the
[1:03:09] other women were just they would have
[1:03:11] lied to him anyways
[1:03:12] they were missing their hair dormant or
[1:03:14] they had a big curl hoop down hanging
[1:03:16] out to the side they'd been like you
[1:03:17] look good go see the king
[1:03:22] can you imagine the anticipation the
[1:03:25] the the desire the pressure the
[1:03:28] reverence the tension
[1:03:31] I think so many times we're so flippant
[1:03:34] about the things of God
[1:03:36] we take so lightly Where We Are
[1:03:39] and what we've been called to and what
[1:03:41] this really means
[1:03:44] and I don't think they went skipping
[1:03:46] across the courtyard or down the hall or
[1:03:48] however they got
[1:03:50] I would imagine that was a long walk
[1:03:53] a long thoughtful contemplated nervous
[1:03:57] walk
[1:04:00] and when Esther comes
[1:04:03] to the door
[1:04:08] she's going to go in before the king
[1:04:13] she's wearing the shoes haggy I said to
[1:04:15] wear
[1:04:16] she's wearing the dress haggy I says the
[1:04:18] where
[1:04:19] she's got the headdress on that haggy I
[1:04:22] said and she put her hair up the way
[1:04:23] haggy I said she's wearing the perfume
[1:04:25] haggy I said
[1:04:28] you see that woman is going to walk in
[1:04:30] there and she is not dependent on one
[1:04:32] thought of her own
[1:04:36] she's not going in there trying to
[1:04:39] present a gift or a feature or a
[1:04:42] sensuality she's not listen none of
[1:04:45] these women were going to entice the
[1:04:47] King by sensuality because the king
[1:04:49] could have any woman he wanted and he
[1:04:50] had vastly the most beautiful of all
[1:04:52] that was that's not what the king's
[1:04:54] looking for she's not trying to uh uh
[1:04:57] achieve things naturally if I could say
[1:05:00] it that way
[1:05:03] but she comes
[1:05:05] and she was different than all the
[1:05:07] others
[1:05:09] to me that means all the others did not
[1:05:12] only require what haggy I had appointed
[1:05:15] because when everybody saw Esther they
[1:05:19] all she they all she found favor in the
[1:05:21] eyes of all of them amen there was
[1:05:23] something different about Esther than
[1:05:25] there was about all the other women
[1:05:29] and Esther's respect
[1:05:32] oh my goodness Esther's respect for the
[1:05:35] king
[1:05:36] was demonstrated in her respect for the
[1:05:39] king's Chamberlain
[1:05:44] and so when when she stepped out of that
[1:05:47] house
[1:05:48] she didn't come with her own thought
[1:05:50] with her own idea with her own Doctrine
[1:05:56] she came because she'd been under the
[1:05:58] ministry of haggai and haggai had
[1:06:00] dressed her in the dressing of the word
[1:06:04] and now she comes to the door
[1:06:07] and and Esther doesn't have to worry
[1:06:10] about if her idea is good enough
[1:06:15] she doesn't have to worry about if if
[1:06:17] her uh little extra adornment or her
[1:06:20] little extra gift or her she don't have
[1:06:22] to worry about if any of that's enough
[1:06:23] because she's not relying on any of that
[1:06:25] amen she oh I I believe Esther come to
[1:06:30] the place where she says if Hagia is
[1:06:32] right then this is right
[1:06:35] if haggai is right then this is the
[1:06:38] right way to present myself to the king
[1:06:40] and if Hagia is wrong I I don't know how
[1:06:43] to be right
[1:06:46] can we understand that as a bride if
[1:06:48] Hagia is wrong ha wow what chance do I
[1:06:51] have of finding a right way to please
[1:06:53] the Lord if haggai's wrong
[1:06:57] so this is this is a situation that
[1:07:00] these women are stepping into amen and
[1:07:02] and and you know they had all kinds of
[1:07:06] different ideas in their mind and
[1:07:08] different thoughts and different
[1:07:09] expectations but over and over they came
[1:07:12] to the king encountered the king had an
[1:07:14] experience with the King amen and moved
[1:07:16] on to the church
[1:07:20] and they sat in church the rest of their
[1:07:22] lives
[1:07:26] and now I'm not talking about baptist
[1:07:29] church now
[1:07:30] I'm talking about our church
[1:07:37] and they kept their idea
[1:07:40] and they kept their experience
[1:07:43] nobody's going to take it away they
[1:07:45] hadn't experience
[1:07:47] they encountered something real
[1:07:51] but there was one
[1:07:53] who wasn't just going to have one
[1:07:54] experience with the King
[1:07:56] she was going to come into a lifelong
[1:07:58] Union with the King
[1:08:01] she was going to become the queen she
[1:08:03] was going to receive seed she was going
[1:08:06] to be a joint Heir she was going to live
[1:08:08] in the past she she was going to get the
[1:08:10] inheritance that was lost by the other
[1:08:12] she was going to get everything
[1:08:15] all the others had an experience with
[1:08:16] the King all the others had a testimony
[1:08:18] they could tell about that experience
[1:08:20] amen but they were in the church amen
[1:08:22] but there was one who wasn't in the
[1:08:24] church amen she was in the palace amen
[1:08:27] she was in the household she was the
[1:08:28] wife she was not a she was not a
[1:08:31] one-time experience she was an all the
[1:08:33] time experience
[1:08:35] she was the wife
[1:08:37] of the king
[1:08:40] I tell you when you start to realize the
[1:08:42] impact and the reality of where we are
[1:08:46] we are sitting in the most dangerous
[1:08:48] seats a human being can sit in
[1:08:51] you're sitting in the most dangerous
[1:08:52] seats I'm standing in the most dangerous
[1:08:54] place amen why because it's always close
[1:08:57] truth that's dangerous and close to the
[1:09:00] king is dangerous
[1:09:02] you can think of one of these women who
[1:09:03] wind up in the house of the concubines
[1:09:05] she's there she may never be called to
[1:09:08] the king ever again and she lives the
[1:09:09] rest of her life and can you imagine 20
[1:09:11] 30 years later she's thinking if I would
[1:09:14] have stayed in the village I could have
[1:09:16] had a husband I could have had children
[1:09:17] I could add a home of my own but here I
[1:09:20] am in the church
[1:09:22] oh all right
[1:09:26] it becomes a dangerous place
[1:09:30] to be close to the king
[1:09:32] and have an encounter in the king and
[1:09:34] take our own ideas
[1:09:37] and to stick with their own ideas
[1:09:39] it becomes very dangerous
[1:09:42] I hope that this is getting through
[1:09:45] the way that it's Dropped In My Heart
[1:09:48] could you turn with me to the Book of
[1:09:49] Ruth
[1:10:04] look at Ruth chapter 3.
[1:10:08] many of us are very familiar with Ruth
[1:10:10] and how she was the moabitist a gentile
[1:10:13] who when
[1:10:15] a himelek and his two sons
[1:10:18] and his wife Naomi they left
[1:10:22] their land they went to Moab because of
[1:10:26] a famine they're the two sons married
[1:10:28] two moabitus a Naomi's return one stays
[1:10:32] back but Ruth says I'll go where you go
[1:10:34] and your people who might be be my
[1:10:36] people my God will be your God and it's
[1:10:38] a type of the Old Testament in the New
[1:10:40] Testament Naomi and the Gentile bride
[1:10:42] Ruth and it's also a type of the old
[1:10:45] church and the new church brother Ben
[1:10:47] uses all these types so we know this
[1:10:49] story but I want to I'm going to look at
[1:10:51] it in a context a certain context here
[1:10:55] and Ruth chapter 3 verse 1.
[1:10:58] it says then Naomi her mother-in-law
[1:11:00] said unto her my daughter shall I seek
[1:11:03] rest for thee that it may be well with
[1:11:05] thee and now is not Boaz of our Kindred
[1:11:08] which has whose maidens thou lust
[1:11:11] with whose means thou was behold he went
[1:11:13] with barley tonight in the threshing
[1:11:15] floor wash thyselfs therefore an anoint
[1:11:18] thee and put thy raiment upon thee and
[1:11:20] get thee down to the floor but make not
[1:11:23] thyself known unto the man until he
[1:11:25] shall have done eating and drinking and
[1:11:28] it shall be when he lieth down that thou
[1:11:31] shalt Mark the place where he shall lie
[1:11:33] and thou shall go in and uncover his
[1:11:35] feet and lay thee down and he will tell
[1:11:38] thee what Thou shalt do and she said
[1:11:40] unto her all that thou sayeth unto me I
[1:11:43] will do
[1:11:45] President says in the message kinsman
[1:11:47] redeemer and from 1960 he says now I
[1:11:49] want you to notice Naomi the old church
[1:11:51] begin to explain to Ruth all the laws
[1:11:53] about a religion like the Old Testament
[1:11:55] is a shadow of the new now I want you to
[1:11:57] get this story right here now I want to
[1:11:59] show the Shadows the Old Testament
[1:12:01] explaining the new if you'll just read
[1:12:03] it for it's a foreshadow of the new so
[1:12:05] brother benham's taking it as Naomi the
[1:12:07] instruction of the word the Old
[1:12:09] Testament instructing the new are Naomi
[1:12:11] instructing the word to Ruth
[1:12:14] all right so
[1:12:17] so Naomi now
[1:12:20] is giving instructions unto Ruth
[1:12:24] and Ruth has the humility to listen to
[1:12:27] Naomi
[1:12:29] Ruth has her own mind
[1:12:31] she's come from her own culture she had
[1:12:33] her own raising before she was married
[1:12:35] before Naomi was her mother-in-law she
[1:12:37] has even seen maybe Naomi's faults
[1:12:42] but she's humble enough to listen to the
[1:12:44] word that Naomi's giving her
[1:12:48] and she she tells Naomi
[1:12:51] to go down to the threshing floor
[1:12:54] and and to find out where the man laid
[1:12:57] down and go lay yourself down at his
[1:13:00] feet
[1:13:01] now the instruction name is giving to
[1:13:03] Ruth these are dangerous instructions
[1:13:07] these are I can put it this way these
[1:13:10] are scandalous instructions
[1:13:13] because she is a widow woman Ruth is a
[1:13:16] young widow woman
[1:13:18] Boaz is a single man as far as we
[1:13:20] understand the story to be and and at
[1:13:23] night she has no business uncovering his
[1:13:27] skirt and laying down at his feet
[1:13:29] there's no business for a woman to lay
[1:13:32] at the feet of a man at night when there
[1:13:35] should be no woman at the threshing
[1:13:37] floor and and Naomi's giving her
[1:13:39] instructions and the instructions to him
[1:13:41] he's giving her amen they're extremely
[1:13:45] dangerous
[1:13:46] I'll just put it that way
[1:13:49] let's go to uh chapter 3 verse 6.
[1:13:53] let's continue reading
[1:13:55] and she went down to the floor and did
[1:13:57] according to all that her mother-in-law
[1:13:59] obeyed her
[1:14:00] and when Boaz had eaten and drunk and
[1:14:01] his heart was merry he went to lie down
[1:14:03] at the end of the Heap of corn and she
[1:14:05] came softly and uncovered his feet and
[1:14:07] laid her down and it came to pass at
[1:14:09] midnight that the man was afraid and
[1:14:11] turned himself and behold a woman lay at
[1:14:14] his feet and he said who art thou and
[1:14:16] she answered I am Ruth thine handmade
[1:14:18] spread therefore thy skirt over thine
[1:14:20] handmaid for thou art a near Kinsman
[1:14:23] and he said blessed be thou the Lord my
[1:14:26] daughter for thou has shown more
[1:14:28] kindness in the latter end than at the
[1:14:29] beginning in so much as thou followest
[1:14:31] not young men whether poor or Rich and
[1:14:35] now my daughter fear not I will do to
[1:14:37] thee all that thou requires for all the
[1:14:40] city of my people does know that thou
[1:14:42] art a virtuous woman
[1:14:44] and now it is true that I am thy near
[1:14:46] Kinsman how be it there is a Kinsman
[1:14:48] nearer than I tarry this Knight and it
[1:14:50] shall be in the morning that if it will
[1:14:52] be that if he will perform unto thee the
[1:14:55] part of kinsman well let him do the
[1:14:56] kinsman's part but if he will not do the
[1:14:59] part of a Kinsmen to thee then will I do
[1:15:02] the part of a Kinsman to thee as the
[1:15:04] Lord liveth lie down until the morning
[1:15:08] so
[1:15:09] there's a there's a lot going on here
[1:15:11] I'm not going to be able to get into all
[1:15:13] the details but but here
[1:15:16] uh we'll just see what brother Branham
[1:15:18] says here in kinsman redeemer
[1:15:20] now notice closely now Naomi said to
[1:15:22] Ruth now he is our Kinsmen and if you
[1:15:25] can find Grace with him you'll find rest
[1:15:27] if you can find Grace you'll find rest
[1:15:30] Boaz represented Christ the rich man the
[1:15:32] heir of all things the lord of the
[1:15:33] Harvest oh my how when Boaz came riding
[1:15:37] out there in the that Carriage looked
[1:15:39] around over the fields and his eyes fell
[1:15:40] on Ruth he was mastered he was Lord of
[1:15:43] the Harvest and she found Grace in his
[1:15:45] sight
[1:15:46] that's what the church does today while
[1:15:49] the lord of the Harvest is going by he
[1:15:50] ain't looking to Big to big buildings
[1:15:52] big Steeples well-trained choirs he's
[1:15:55] looking for individuals men and women
[1:15:57] who are dedicated and made a clean cut
[1:15:59] for for Christ earlier is a clean-cut
[1:16:01] decision a clean cut for Christ
[1:16:03] consecrating themselves to his service
[1:16:05] God I believe it every word of it when
[1:16:08] your word says anything I stay right
[1:16:10] with it that's your word I believe it
[1:16:12] every word that's what he's looking for
[1:16:15] the lord of the Harvest that's what he
[1:16:16] wants to give the Holy Spirit to those
[1:16:19] who are hungering and thirsting blessed
[1:16:21] are ye that hunger and thirst for you
[1:16:22] shall be filled he's trying to find that
[1:16:25] church today now when Ruth was asked to
[1:16:28] do something that was disgraceful but
[1:16:31] she was willing because she'd made her
[1:16:32] decision what type of believer what a
[1:16:35] perfect type
[1:16:37] so they're a perfect type of a Believer
[1:16:39] why she was asked to do something
[1:16:41] disgraceful
[1:16:43] she was asked to do something that in
[1:16:45] the eyes of the world was wrong
[1:16:48] that in the eyes of the world what was
[1:16:50] inappropriate and wrong she was asked to
[1:16:54] actually sneak in at night to where a
[1:16:56] man was laying asleep and uncover his
[1:16:58] skirt and lay herself at his feet
[1:17:01] this was scandalous this was wrong this
[1:17:05] was an inappropriate
[1:17:08] do you understand what I'm saying
[1:17:10] and Ruth had enough humility to do what
[1:17:14] Naomi said
[1:17:16] and what was she doing she was following
[1:17:20] Naomi's instructions and in following
[1:17:22] Naomi's destruction she was asked to do
[1:17:24] something that if this goes wrong I'm
[1:17:28] going to look bad to everybody
[1:17:30] the whole city considered her a virtuous
[1:17:32] woman but they would consider her a
[1:17:34] harlot if this went wrong
[1:17:37] if this goes the wrong way amen this
[1:17:40] this is we're coming down to another Do
[1:17:42] or Die moment we're coming down to it's
[1:17:45] going to go one way or it's going to go
[1:17:47] the other if this man accuses me of
[1:17:49] attempted harlotry she's going down to
[1:17:52] Boaz she can't control what Boaz will
[1:17:54] say she does not control Boaz she only
[1:17:57] controls herself Boaz can say whatever
[1:18:00] he wants if Boaz doesn't if Boaz doesn't
[1:18:04] understand what she's doing if Boaz has
[1:18:06] a false accusation she could be accused
[1:18:09] of harlotry
[1:18:14] you see how dangerous this is
[1:18:17] it's only going to go one way or the
[1:18:19] other
[1:18:22] in the Kinsmen Redeemer says Ruth a
[1:18:25] gentile excommunicated runoff has been
[1:18:27] brought to be accepted his bride Christ
[1:18:29] came in just at Barley season
[1:18:31] he said now put the
[1:18:34] now put the garments upon thee talking
[1:18:36] about Naomi's instructions
[1:18:38] not take the garments off of thee how
[1:18:39] contrary today gird the garments upon
[1:18:41] thee when you go to meet him he's going
[1:18:43] to win a barley tonight go down and put
[1:18:45] your garments on cover yourself up to
[1:18:48] meet him
[1:18:49] how do you cover yourself up to meet him
[1:18:51] you clothed yourself in the word you
[1:18:52] don't take a word off
[1:18:54] you put all the word on
[1:18:58] and today they want to uncover
[1:18:59] themselves cover yourself go down
[1:19:01] because he winners barley and then Mark
[1:19:03] the place where he lieth down did you do
[1:19:05] it on galgotha many years ago I marked
[1:19:08] in my heart where he laid down his life
[1:19:10] that he might take me Mark the place
[1:19:12] where he lie it down watch where he laid
[1:19:14] that's what every believer should do
[1:19:16] mark what he done for you now he's
[1:19:18] trying he's typing uh Boaz as Christ and
[1:19:22] he laid down at Calvary and you go to
[1:19:24] his feet there amen and it's a beautiful
[1:19:26] time
[1:19:27] but he goes on and he says uh and
[1:19:30] kinsman redeemer
[1:19:33] oh what a clear-cut decision
[1:19:36] Ruth said sorry Ruth said what you say
[1:19:38] that I'll do
[1:19:40] what a clear-cut decision for a Believer
[1:19:42] what the Bible says that I'll do it says
[1:19:44] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:19:46] Jesus Christ I'll do it if it says go
[1:19:48] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:19:50] I'll do it if it says whatever it says
[1:19:52] Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today
[1:19:53] forever ever what it says for me to do
[1:19:56] I'll do it see the church taking its
[1:19:58] orders from the word she laid down
[1:20:01] so he's typing these strong instructions
[1:20:03] from Naomi as the word coming to Ruth
[1:20:05] and Ruth humbling herself to the word
[1:20:08] now remember here's what he says now
[1:20:10] remember that was a disgrace for that
[1:20:13] young widow woman to be laying by the
[1:20:14] side of this man and his feet a disgrace
[1:20:17] to the outside world oh can you stand it
[1:20:20] here it is look look this is it the
[1:20:22] church the young women the young men the
[1:20:24] older and young it's asked to separate
[1:20:26] themselves from the world and come into
[1:20:28] a place a kingdom of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:29] that's disgraceful to the world in their
[1:20:32] own heart they know what it's all about
[1:20:34] but to the world they become a fanatic
[1:20:37] they become a Holy Roller or something
[1:20:38] on that idea some disgraceful name but
[1:20:41] the church is asked to do it are you
[1:20:43] willing to Mark the place and lie down
[1:20:45] let the world call you anything they
[1:20:47] want to
[1:20:50] hmm
[1:20:55] Ruth now under the instructions of the
[1:20:58] word
[1:21:01] she's got to come to a place where she
[1:21:04] made her decision to follow the word
[1:21:07] but her decision to follow the word was
[1:21:10] not going to land her in an in-between
[1:21:12] state
[1:21:14] it is either going to put her accused of
[1:21:17] being a harlot
[1:21:19] or the wife of the lord of the Harvest
[1:21:23] she is going to go one way or the other
[1:21:25] she is not going to come she's not going
[1:21:28] to come out of this encounter halfway
[1:21:31] anything
[1:21:32] does that make sense to you
[1:21:34] understand we come to this message we
[1:21:37] are not going to we we are going to go
[1:21:40] one way or the other with this word
[1:21:41] friends we are going to continue in our
[1:21:44] own idea mixed with the truth and we're
[1:21:46] going to
[1:21:48] we are going to go into harlotry still
[1:21:50] receiving man's seed
[1:21:53] and mixing it with what the prophet
[1:21:55] brought
[1:21:57] I hope you understand what I'm saying
[1:22:00] we're going to come we're either going
[1:22:03] to come or we're going to come and be
[1:22:06] recognized by Boaz
[1:22:08] as the right kind of woman and we're
[1:22:10] going to be brought into the Plan of
[1:22:12] Redemption or we're going to be accused
[1:22:15] of doing something wrong
[1:22:17] and we can be accused of doing something
[1:22:19] wrong anyways how many of you come to
[1:22:21] the message and everybody else around
[1:22:22] you thought you were doing something
[1:22:23] wrong it looked wrong it looked evil it
[1:22:26] looked backwards it looked like it was
[1:22:28] contrary to the word they accused you of
[1:22:30] following a man that accused you a
[1:22:31] following a call they accuse you of all
[1:22:34] kinds of spiritualism
[1:22:36] is that right
[1:22:37] and so what what you were doing and
[1:22:40] following the word you were subjecting
[1:22:42] yourself to the wrong opinion of all the
[1:22:44] outside world because you were going to
[1:22:46] slip down in the dark of night and
[1:22:49] uncover a man's feet and you're giving
[1:22:50] yourself completely holy to this man who
[1:22:53] you can't control
[1:22:56] this was the most dangerous decision of
[1:22:59] Ruth's life
[1:23:01] this was the most dangerous point in her
[1:23:03] life she could wind up burnt
[1:23:07] as a harlot
[1:23:09] Stoned by the congregation rejected by
[1:23:12] everybody uh she was an outsider anyways
[1:23:15] but she had a good reputation she could
[1:23:17] have been cast out she could have lost
[1:23:19] what little bit she had she could have
[1:23:21] lost it or she could have gained
[1:23:23] everything she could have never had on
[1:23:25] her own
[1:23:28] she came to the point
[1:23:31] and when she came to the point
[1:23:33] she didn't take her ideas
[1:23:36] her thinking she just did what Naomi
[1:23:39] told her
[1:23:41] she just did what the word says
[1:23:48] oh I I hope I hope this is coming across
[1:23:53] the right way
[1:23:56] every one of us sit in the most
[1:23:59] dangerous position
[1:24:04] you can't come to this message and hold
[1:24:06] back and halfway believe in one foot in
[1:24:08] one for out and I'll just wait and see
[1:24:10] how things go and I can jump either way
[1:24:13] when the time comes
[1:24:16] God's not going to let it stay that way
[1:24:18] it's either in or out
[1:24:20] it's either all the way or it's a
[1:24:22] concubine
[1:24:26] I don't know how else to say it
[1:24:28] I
[1:24:30] it's just the reality of where we're at
[1:24:33] God didn't bring us the greatest word
[1:24:34] the greatest Revelation has ever struck
[1:24:36] the Earth for us to be halfway Believers
[1:24:38] and halfway not Believers and and stuck
[1:24:40] somewhere in between and not fully
[1:24:42] committing to anything that is not what
[1:24:44] we're that's not where we're at friends
[1:24:47] and not taking some of what the prophet
[1:24:49] said or most of what the prophet said
[1:24:51] and still mixing it with some of my own
[1:24:52] ideas and my own old understanding from
[1:24:55] denominational days or my own new
[1:24:57] understanding that I came up with by
[1:24:59] myself in the message
[1:25:00] it goes both ways
[1:25:05] but for Ruth
[1:25:07] this is what's been hitting me with
[1:25:09] impact
[1:25:10] when Esther walked through that door it
[1:25:12] was Do or Die
[1:25:14] when Ruth went down to that flesh
[1:25:16] threshing floor at night it was Do or
[1:25:18] Die
[1:25:19] if somebody turned the lights on
[1:25:22] how are you going to explain that
[1:25:26] do you understand what I'm saying
[1:25:29] she was giving herself up
[1:25:33] Esther was giving herself up and
[1:25:36] trusting haggai Ruth was giving herself
[1:25:39] up but I'll take it back this way Esther
[1:25:42] was completely giving herself up and
[1:25:44] trusting haggai and trusting the king
[1:25:48] and she was moving from haggai to the
[1:25:50] king trusting that this was a true
[1:25:52] servant of that King
[1:25:55] and she had to trust in both
[1:25:59] and here comes Ruth she comes to a point
[1:26:02] where she has to trust Naomi and she has
[1:26:04] to trust Boaz
[1:26:06] and she has to trust that Naomi knows
[1:26:09] Boaz and she knows the word and she's
[1:26:11] giving her good instruction because
[1:26:13] Naomi understands the law of Kinsmen
[1:26:15] Redeemer she's a Jew she understands
[1:26:17] this word
[1:26:20] and she has to trust Naomi giving her
[1:26:23] the right word and she has to trust the
[1:26:25] character of that man on the threshing
[1:26:26] floor not to expose her falsely
[1:26:34] when we come to Christ
[1:26:36] in this message
[1:26:38] we have to trust that this was a servant
[1:26:40] of Christ
[1:26:42] we have to trust that God sent him and
[1:26:44] God spoke through him and he was here to
[1:26:46] to dress a bride
[1:26:49] for her Union with Christ
[1:26:51] to prepare her for Christ and then we
[1:26:53] have to trust Christ that Christ is not
[1:26:55] going to give us false hope and cast us
[1:26:58] away and overexpose us because we're
[1:27:01] we're making the the ultimate decision
[1:27:03] the most dangerous decision of Our Lives
[1:27:05] that I'm believing this servant of the
[1:27:08] king and now I'm going to walk myself
[1:27:10] all alone without haggai into the
[1:27:13] presence of the king trusting his
[1:27:15] character to not expose me not do me
[1:27:17] wrong not cast me away
[1:27:24] this is why nothing in between is going
[1:27:26] to work
[1:27:28] if I don't come God's provide a way then
[1:27:31] if if I want to come my own way I can
[1:27:34] have an encounter with the king I can
[1:27:35] have an experience in church and I can
[1:27:37] be a concubine
[1:27:40] but I don't think any of us want to be
[1:27:41] that
[1:27:43] I think we want to be his bride
[1:27:46] in order to be that then I have got to
[1:27:48] sell out everything
[1:27:51] if I'm going to be as bright if Ruth is
[1:27:54] going to be in the program of redemption
[1:27:56] if she's going to be in the lineage of
[1:27:58] Christ if she's going to bring
[1:27:59] Redemption and salvation to herself and
[1:28:01] Naomi she has to give up everything not
[1:28:05] partial all
[1:28:06] Esther if she's going to be part of
[1:28:09] God's Plan of Salvation for the Jews if
[1:28:11] she's going to save her own life amen
[1:28:13] she is going to have to give all not
[1:28:15] partial and you and I are not here for
[1:28:17] partial we're here for all
[1:28:24] oh my goodness God help us
[1:28:28] let's look at verse 14.
[1:28:34] but first let's let's see what boaz's
[1:28:36] response was
[1:28:38] she dressed herself according to what
[1:28:40] Naomi said not undressed herself
[1:28:42] Ruth also is not trying to entice Boaz
[1:28:47] she's not trying oh
[1:28:50] she is not trying to seduce Boaz
[1:28:54] you understand what I'm saying she's not
[1:28:56] using her gifts or her charm or her
[1:28:58] Charisma she's not using her physical
[1:29:00] appearance she's not using any of that
[1:29:02] she's not Charming Boaz she is humbling
[1:29:05] herself and laying herself as a as a
[1:29:08] handmaid At His Feet as a servant and
[1:29:10] she is trying to to win his pleasure by
[1:29:13] her character and obedience to Naomi
[1:29:17] and and Boaz is not he's not Charmed uh
[1:29:22] by her Charisma he he is not taken off
[1:29:25] his feet by her hairdress he's not he's
[1:29:27] not swept away by her fragrance
[1:29:31] but he watches her submission
[1:29:37] and her yielding herself to him and he
[1:29:40] says your kindness and the latter end is
[1:29:43] better than the first
[1:29:45] because he understands he says that you
[1:29:47] did not go after young men whether rich
[1:29:49] or poor which indicates that Boaz is not
[1:29:52] a young man
[1:29:54] and and she now is giving herself
[1:29:58] not for not for sensuality
[1:30:02] not for personal pleasure
[1:30:04] she is now surrendering so for
[1:30:06] Redemption
[1:30:09] her motive
[1:30:11] her motive in doing what the world sees
[1:30:14] is bad
[1:30:16] her motive in leaving the church she
[1:30:19] grew up in
[1:30:21] her motive and not no longer believing
[1:30:24] in the trinity
[1:30:27] I mean if you don't believe in the
[1:30:29] Trinity and you believe God sent a
[1:30:31] prophet and you believe water baptism in
[1:30:33] Jesus name and you believe that women
[1:30:34] and men should dress holy and conduct
[1:30:36] themselves holy and you believe all of
[1:30:37] these things then then then you are
[1:30:39] considered a wrong kind of person with
[1:30:42] the wrong motives and you're considered
[1:30:44] following after devils and that is
[1:30:46] harlotry
[1:30:48] so you're you get an untasty name you're
[1:30:51] considered an outcast to harlot just for
[1:30:53] following the word
[1:30:56] and here comes a woman who will can who
[1:31:00] will be considered an outcast and who'd
[1:31:02] be willing to be considered a harlot
[1:31:07] doing something that would be
[1:31:10] disgraceful until all the other churches
[1:31:11] what we do is disgraceful
[1:31:14] believe God sent a prophet and that he
[1:31:16] brought the correct teaching on the word
[1:31:17] and denounce everything else contrary to
[1:31:19] that
[1:31:20] that's considered disgraceful
[1:31:23] to the denominational world
[1:31:26] and she came that way
[1:31:28] laying herself
[1:31:30] complete she is now completely exposed
[1:31:36] and 100 in the hands of Boaz
[1:31:40] her whole life is in his hands
[1:31:44] he says what are you doing here hey guys
[1:31:47] come here look at this her life is over
[1:31:50] her reputation is really she's done
[1:31:53] she is coming but she's coming with a
[1:31:56] motive
[1:31:57] she's coming for a purpose and she's not
[1:32:00] coming there for sensual pleasure she's
[1:32:02] not coming there for personal rewards
[1:32:04] she's coming there according to the word
[1:32:06] because there's a law of a Kinsmen
[1:32:08] Redeemer and she is the only one a man
[1:32:11] that can fit this place amen because
[1:32:13] Boaz is the only one that can bring
[1:32:16] Redemption and bring Redemption through
[1:32:18] a seed but Naomi already said I can't
[1:32:20] bring you any more seeds she's already
[1:32:22] old now Ruth is in the only position for
[1:32:25] Redemption
[1:32:27] and she's willing to lay her life down
[1:32:30] and forget everything she knew her
[1:32:32] reputation and whether this will go
[1:32:34] right or wrong She lays it down for
[1:32:37] Redemption and when Boaz looks at her he
[1:32:39] says everybody knows you're a virtuous
[1:32:41] woman but now your kindness in the
[1:32:43] latter end is better you're not here
[1:32:45] because of sensual reasons you're not
[1:32:47] here for illicit pleasure you're not
[1:32:49] here for your own gratification you are
[1:32:52] here for Redemption and to preserve life
[1:32:58] oh
[1:32:59] how many women would have liked Boaz for
[1:33:02] a husband
[1:33:04] rich
[1:33:06] lord of the Harvest
[1:33:08] what had what had Boaz seen in his
[1:33:10] lifetime
[1:33:13] flirting and whatever I mean you can
[1:33:16] only imagine
[1:33:18] don't go thinking that four or five
[1:33:21] thousand three four five thousand years
[1:33:22] ago was different than today
[1:33:24] just a lot of different things appear
[1:33:27] different but the heart of man's the
[1:33:29] same
[1:33:32] so Boaz he recognizes what she did
[1:33:38] in every other circumstance what she did
[1:33:41] would be wrong
[1:33:43] but for the circumstance of redemption
[1:33:46] what she did was right
[1:33:49] I hope that makes sense
[1:33:57] I don't even know how deeply that makes
[1:33:58] sense but it makes sense
[1:34:02] let's go to verse 14.
[1:34:06] now Boaz tells her
[1:34:11] uh
[1:34:12] in verse 13 then he says lie down until
[1:34:14] morning
[1:34:15] he told her just to stay there till the
[1:34:17] morning stay at his feet
[1:34:19] so she remained in the position of a
[1:34:23] servant through the night
[1:34:26] but in the morning there's going to be a
[1:34:28] transition
[1:34:30] because we've come to the dawning of a
[1:34:32] new day when there's going to be a
[1:34:34] transition
[1:34:35] where I no longer call you church but I
[1:34:37] call you bride something's changing in
[1:34:39] the new day
[1:34:41] so stay till morning in verse 14 and she
[1:34:44] lay at his feet until morning and she
[1:34:46] rose up before one could know another
[1:34:48] and he said let it not be known that a
[1:34:51] woman came into the floor now he's
[1:34:53] protecting her character he he she's in
[1:34:56] his hands but he knows how to handle the
[1:34:58] situation
[1:35:01] also he said verse 15 also he said bring
[1:35:04] the veil that thou Hast upon thee and
[1:35:07] hold it and when she held it he measured
[1:35:10] six measures of barley and laid it on
[1:35:12] her and she went into the city in which
[1:35:14] she came to her mother-in-law she said
[1:35:16] who art thou my daughter and she and she
[1:35:19] told her all that the man had done to
[1:35:21] her and she said these six measures of
[1:35:24] barley gave him me for he said to me go
[1:35:26] not empty unto them into thy
[1:35:28] mother-in-law then said she said sit
[1:35:31] still my daughter until thou know how
[1:35:33] the matter will fall for the man will
[1:35:35] not be in rest until he has finished the
[1:35:37] thing this day
[1:35:41] so now
[1:35:43] in the
[1:35:45] in the dawning of a new day
[1:35:51] early in the morning at the rising of
[1:35:53] the sun we could say
[1:35:55] there's a resurrection of Boaz
[1:35:58] and when there's a resurrection of boas
[1:36:00] there's a resurrection of Ruth as well
[1:36:03] she'd been laying through the rest of
[1:36:05] the night at his feet as a servant but
[1:36:08] now the transition is going to take
[1:36:09] place so for the transition takes place
[1:36:11] he takes her veil he said take your Veil
[1:36:14] so at this point now that the bride has
[1:36:17] been unveiled
[1:36:20] foreign
[1:36:21] and
[1:36:23] put six measures of barley amen six
[1:36:27] measures of the seed of the seed word
[1:36:30] are six seals
[1:36:32] in her veil
[1:36:35] and she's caring and he places it upon
[1:36:37] her and now she's carrying six seals
[1:36:40] because she has the revelation of the
[1:36:42] seals
[1:36:45] please follow with me
[1:36:47] put on your spiritual jackets
[1:36:50] now in the transition in the early
[1:36:53] morning of this new day he's going to
[1:36:56] take her veil and he's going to she's
[1:36:59] now unveiled before him and now he's
[1:37:03] going to put six measures of barley he's
[1:37:05] going to give the interpretation of the
[1:37:07] six seals she had been gleaning word all
[1:37:10] through the Harvest period
[1:37:13] getting a little bit and the lord of the
[1:37:15] Harvest told his servants drop handfuls
[1:37:17] of purpose for her so he's talking to
[1:37:19] the seven Church uh aged Messengers and
[1:37:22] the ministers that follow after to keep
[1:37:24] drawing the gleaning keep dropping word
[1:37:26] for her and she's working and laboring
[1:37:28] to pick up little bits of word
[1:37:30] and every day she's getting little bits
[1:37:33] of word and threshing it out and she's
[1:37:34] surviving her and them are surviving on
[1:37:37] this little bits of word that she's
[1:37:38] gleaning but oh they're coming to the
[1:37:41] end of the Harvest and there's not going
[1:37:42] to be an opportunity for gleaning
[1:37:44] anymore now it's going to go into the
[1:37:46] coldness of winter soon
[1:37:49] so before it goes into the coldness of
[1:37:52] winter when there's not any more
[1:37:53] gleaning or Reapers in the field to drop
[1:37:55] handfuls of purpose now he takes what's
[1:37:58] been been gathered all of the word
[1:38:00] that's been gathered up and he gives her
[1:38:02] six heaping full full loads of the six
[1:38:05] seals
[1:38:06] [Music]
[1:38:11] and he sends her back
[1:38:13] and she shows Naomi and Naomi Knows by
[1:38:17] this
[1:38:18] that he's going to accomplish all that
[1:38:20] he said
[1:38:22] She Knows by the opening of the seals
[1:38:26] that he's going to he will not rest till
[1:38:28] he finishes it this day
[1:38:31] what day this bride day
[1:38:34] this new day The Eighth Day
[1:38:37] he's not going to finish to accomplish
[1:38:39] all that he said why because he gave you
[1:38:41] the six men in your Veil he put the six
[1:38:44] measures of barley he gave you these
[1:38:46] heaping measures of the word because
[1:38:48] you've been gleaning gleaning gleaning
[1:38:49] and now he gave it to you in abundance
[1:38:51] and she goes back to the house she's not
[1:38:53] gleaning anymore her enemy are at the
[1:38:55] house they've got more than they need
[1:39:00] but that's not the end of the story
[1:39:04] because she doesn't yet have the seventh
[1:39:06] seal
[1:39:07] foreign
[1:39:15] the matter is not complete
[1:39:18] until the seventh seal
[1:39:23] and
[1:39:24] and when you look at the six measures of
[1:39:27] barley he gave to her
[1:39:29] that was a tremendous blessing
[1:39:32] if you were the woman who had been
[1:39:33] gleaning and gleaning and gleaning and
[1:39:35] grabbing handfuls and beating it out at
[1:39:37] the end of the day and going home with a
[1:39:39] little apron pocket full of seed to
[1:39:41] grind and make some bread for that day
[1:39:43] or a few days and trying to get some
[1:39:45] together for winter I mean if that was
[1:39:48] you in your life and you had been living
[1:39:49] that way like the church lived through
[1:39:51] the church ages when all of a sudden
[1:39:53] heaps upon you word upon word upon word
[1:39:56] upon word she's going home with the
[1:39:58] Jubilee she's got a veil full of burden
[1:40:00] on her back she's got all the word that
[1:40:03] she can handle right now
[1:40:04] [Music]
[1:40:08] how did she get to this point because
[1:40:10] she gave everything her reputation and
[1:40:13] all and come to the point where it's Do
[1:40:15] or Die
[1:40:18] and when Boaz saw that he knew the
[1:40:20] motive of their heart and the intention
[1:40:21] and he said I will redeem
[1:40:25] I will finish I will do all that you
[1:40:26] require
[1:40:30] but I just
[1:40:33] don't know how to
[1:40:35] I don't know how to articulate
[1:40:37] everything that's in my heart but
[1:40:40] they're feasting on the six seals
[1:40:46] feasting on it
[1:40:48] white horse rider Antichrist Spirit
[1:40:51] right feasting on I mean glory in the
[1:40:55] abundance
[1:40:59] but Redemption wasn't sealed and the six
[1:41:03] seals Redemption was sealed in the
[1:41:05] seventh
[1:41:09] and he he was entering into his claiming
[1:41:12] Ministry to finish the Redemption
[1:41:14] process and claim what he had redeemed
[1:41:17] under the seventh seal
[1:41:19] in the new day
[1:41:22] and let's look at chapter 4 verse 13.
[1:41:25] we know he goes into the City and he he
[1:41:28] he makes the promise he confronts the
[1:41:31] near Kinsmen all of those things
[1:41:33] but then in verse 13 it says
[1:41:36] so Boaz took Ruth
[1:41:39] and she was his wife
[1:41:41] and when he went in unto her the lord
[1:41:42] gave her conception
[1:41:44] and she'd bear a son
[1:41:49] when she gave everything
[1:41:54] at the end of Harvest Time
[1:41:56] and she humbled herself
[1:41:58] and gave herself the opportunity to have
[1:42:00] a bad reputation
[1:42:03] listen I'll tell you
[1:42:04] even amongst our friends
[1:42:07] if you believe in the bride age the
[1:42:09] eighth in the coming of the Lord you
[1:42:10] have a bad reputation
[1:42:13] of maybe being involved in harlotry
[1:42:16] is that right
[1:42:18] laying with those you shouldn't lay with
[1:42:20] and
[1:42:23] believing things you shouldn't believe
[1:42:26] but Ruth had to get past all of that
[1:42:30] Ruth had to get to the place
[1:42:33] where it didn't matter I'm here for life
[1:42:37] I'm here to preserve life I'm here for
[1:42:39] Redemption I'm not here for a name I'm
[1:42:41] not here for a reputation I'm going to
[1:42:44] surrender to all of this word and I am
[1:42:46] here for Redemption
[1:42:49] and Redemption could only be found in
[1:42:51] Boaz
[1:42:52] Andrews
[1:42:55] so now Boaz does what he has to do and
[1:42:58] he's in his claiming Ministry and now he
[1:43:00] comes
[1:43:02] he comes to Ruth and Ruth has been
[1:43:06] gleaning Ruth has now got received a
[1:43:10] promise at the new day Ruth has received
[1:43:14] the six measures of barley and her veil
[1:43:16] and and now she's rejoicing in that
[1:43:19] but if Ruth stays with the six measures
[1:43:23] of barley
[1:43:24] and never goes to the seventh
[1:43:26] redemption's not finished
[1:43:32] it's good barley
[1:43:34] it's good word it's a heaping full it's
[1:43:37] something to Rejoice about it's
[1:43:39] something to be glad in but if we stay
[1:43:42] with the with with the six seals amen
[1:43:44] and miss the seventh seal amen then all
[1:43:47] of a sudden we're still going to wind up
[1:43:49] in darkness and coldness of winter
[1:43:51] because this will run out but there's
[1:43:53] something that's greater
[1:43:57] and that's the seventh seal which the
[1:44:00] seventh seal is not a doctor in the
[1:44:02] Seven Seals of person
[1:44:05] and the seventh seal is the lord of the
[1:44:07] Harvest
[1:44:08] he's the one who gave the six
[1:44:11] and brother Graham said I'm not the one
[1:44:12] who opened those seals he opened those
[1:44:15] seals who the lord of the Harvest the
[1:44:17] lord of the Harvest and the new day gave
[1:44:20] the six measures of barley amen but
[1:44:22] where was the seventh measure it wasn't
[1:44:25] going to come like the other six
[1:44:28] have you read that your church have you
[1:44:30] read the sales book amen uh the the
[1:44:32] first seal there's a whole lot of wheat
[1:44:34] seconds you know they're a whole lot of
[1:44:36] wheat you go through them all Amen in
[1:44:38] tying these scriptures together types
[1:44:40] and shadows showing all of this and you
[1:44:42] get to the seventh seal and at the end
[1:44:43] of the seventh seal you're like where's
[1:44:45] the barley
[1:44:47] where's the heaping scoop where is it
[1:44:49] amen you've got to look past the scoop
[1:44:51] to the hand that's holding the scoop
[1:44:52] because that's when the seven seal
[1:44:54] starts to appear
[1:44:56] and it's the person it's the lord of the
[1:44:58] Harvest it's the person of the word it's
[1:45:00] the one who opened the word he's the
[1:45:02] seven seal and now in the day of
[1:45:04] redemption she's got the six measures of
[1:45:06] barley that's just to show that he's not
[1:45:08] going to stop until he's done
[1:45:13] but when he's done he's going to come
[1:45:15] and take that little bride and they're
[1:45:17] going to go into a secret room
[1:45:20] and a third pool in a private chamber
[1:45:23] and they're going to have an invisible
[1:45:24] Union that nobody else is going to see
[1:45:26] and in that visible Union she's going to
[1:45:29] get the seventh measure of seed and
[1:45:31] that's not going to be another Doctrine
[1:45:33] that's not going to be that seventh
[1:45:35] measure of seed is going to be the
[1:45:37] person of the word the lord of the
[1:45:39] Harvest in her
[1:45:44] and until we come to that point we
[1:45:48] haven't come to Redemption
[1:45:52] that's why to wait on the seventh seal
[1:45:54] is dangerous
[1:45:56] to deny the seventh seal is dangerous
[1:46:00] there's nothing wrong with rejoicing
[1:46:02] over the six I mean let's Rejoice over
[1:46:04] the six but once you get the seventh you
[1:46:07] never have to worry about running out of
[1:46:09] the six amen because the lord of the
[1:46:11] Harvest owns the field owns the weed
[1:46:14] owns the Garners owns it all and he's
[1:46:16] constantly giving more barley more
[1:46:18] barley more but you're never going to
[1:46:20] run out because you are part of the lord
[1:46:23] of the Harvest you have come as a joint
[1:46:25] Heir and now there's no fear of the dark
[1:46:27] winter cycle there's no fear of the
[1:46:29] apostasy of the seventh age because the
[1:46:31] lord of the Harvest is your husband he
[1:46:34] is you and you are him and he is now in
[1:46:36] you he's injected his seed into you
[1:46:40] and now you're carrying the seventh seal
[1:46:45] what happened Boaz was the Redeemer
[1:46:48] is that right
[1:46:51] but Ruth had come out of Moab she had
[1:46:54] come through this Union uh uh with a Jew
[1:46:57] and now the inheritance has to be
[1:47:00] restored and a son can restore to the
[1:47:02] same lineage and and now Boaz does the
[1:47:04] restoration but when Boaz amen when the
[1:47:07] when when the
[1:47:09] when the son of man injects himself into
[1:47:12] the woman now she's going to produce the
[1:47:14] son of man
[1:47:17] now the Redeemer is in Ruth
[1:47:21] because now when Boaz dies this child
[1:47:24] gets all of boaz's inheritance and all
[1:47:27] of ahem elect's inheritance amen
[1:47:29] everything is restored by the one that's
[1:47:32] in the woman Redemption and its votes
[1:47:34] now the Redeemer is in her
[1:47:38] because she's caring
[1:47:40] the son the Redeemer
[1:47:42] the lord of the Harvest
[1:47:45] now who's she carrying in her womb
[1:47:47] she's carrying the lord of the Harvest
[1:47:50] because when Boaz fails off the scene
[1:47:52] this child will race and be the Lord now
[1:47:55] the lord of the Harvest is in her the
[1:47:56] Redeemer is in her the the great king is
[1:47:59] in her
[1:48:04] that's where we all want to be
[1:48:07] how did she get there she had to give
[1:48:10] everything
[1:48:12] we all want to be there we all want to
[1:48:14] be in that new day with the six measures
[1:48:17] and we we want to be the the one that
[1:48:19] goes into the private Union and the
[1:48:21] marriage and receives the seed and now
[1:48:23] never has to worry again and Redemption
[1:48:26] is sealed in me amen Redemption was
[1:48:28] sealed and Ruth
[1:48:30] Redemption is sealed in you and I when
[1:48:33] we receive Christ in this day
[1:48:35] we all want to be there
[1:48:38] but how many are willing to give up all
[1:48:40] their ideas and go do something untasty
[1:48:43] unsavory that might backfire and might
[1:48:45] make you look really bad
[1:48:49] how many are willing to leave normal
[1:48:51] understanding
[1:48:54] to come into the understanding of the
[1:48:55] seventh seal
[1:48:57] how many are willing to look like the
[1:49:00] wrong kind of woman
[1:49:01] in order to be the right kind of woman
[1:49:06] you'd be surprised how many people
[1:49:08] aren't willing to look bad to be right
[1:49:13] think about that
[1:49:16] not willing to look bad to be right but
[1:49:18] always want to look right
[1:49:20] and wind up in the house that concubines
[1:49:25] but there's got to be somebody out there
[1:49:27] that's willing to look bad in order to
[1:49:30] be right
[1:49:32] to look a little bit odd to look a
[1:49:34] little bit crazy to look a little bit
[1:49:39] whatever
[1:49:41] because their motive is right and they
[1:49:43] want Redemption
[1:49:45] somebody's got to be willing
[1:49:49] right
[1:49:50] somebody's got to be willing to give up
[1:49:52] their life
[1:49:56] oh my
[1:50:00] I want to look a little further down in
[1:50:02] chapter four at something verse 9. and
[1:50:05] I'm gonna I'm gonna try to finish with
[1:50:07] this
[1:50:08] this next thought not this next
[1:50:10] scripture okay
[1:50:12] I don't want to be I don't want to get
[1:50:14] false advertising
[1:50:16] I don't want to be accused of anything
[1:50:20] so let's look here at verse 9.
[1:50:25] and Boaz said to the elders and all the
[1:50:27] people your Witnesses this day that I
[1:50:29] have bought all that was the human
[1:50:31] limilex and all that was Chileans and
[1:50:34] Mullins of the hand of Naomi more of a
[1:50:36] root the moabitus the wife of Molin have
[1:50:39] I purchased to be my wife to raise up
[1:50:41] the name of the Dead upon his
[1:50:43] inheritance that the name of the Dead be
[1:50:45] not cut off from among his Brethren and
[1:50:46] from the Gate of his place your
[1:50:49] Witnesses this day and all the people
[1:50:51] that were in the gate and the Elder said
[1:50:53] we Are Witnesses the Lord make the woman
[1:50:56] that has come unto thee thy house like
[1:50:58] Rachel and like Leah which too did build
[1:51:01] the house of Israel
[1:51:03] and do thou worthily in effortal and be
[1:51:06] famous in Bethlehem and let thy house be
[1:51:09] like the house of pharaz whom Tamar bear
[1:51:13] unto Judah of the seed which the Lord
[1:51:14] shall give thee of this young woman
[1:51:18] I think this is an outstanding scripture
[1:51:21] because of where I want to go next
[1:51:24] as as they begin to praise Boaz in the
[1:51:28] decision he's made for Redemption and
[1:51:29] taking Ruth they begin to say may may
[1:51:32] this woman that's brought unto you be
[1:51:34] like Rachel and be like Leah who built
[1:51:36] the house of Israel the mothers of
[1:51:37] Israel and may your house be like the
[1:51:40] house of pharaohs who tame our boar
[1:51:43] and I looked at this right here in the
[1:51:46] story of Ruth we have the mention of
[1:51:48] Tamar who came first and I want to go
[1:51:51] look at the story of Tamar in Genesis
[1:51:52] 38.
[1:52:10] and in the Book of Genesis
[1:52:12] Judah has three boys
[1:52:16] and Judah we know is the kingly tribe
[1:52:19] the scepter is promised to come through
[1:52:21] Judah he's going to be the head of the
[1:52:23] government through Judah and and through
[1:52:25] his tribe is going to come the king so
[1:52:27] there's a promise laying there Judah has
[1:52:29] a firstborn son and that son is married
[1:52:31] to a woman named Tamar but before she
[1:52:33] could conceive seed he dies so then he's
[1:52:37] given to the second son because that's
[1:52:39] the law of the day to bring up seed Into
[1:52:41] the Dead brother so this son that
[1:52:44] doesn't necessarily want to bring seed
[1:52:46] through Tamar because if he sees bring
[1:52:48] seed through Tamar the seed in Tamar
[1:52:51] will get the inheritance and he'll be
[1:52:53] left out
[1:52:55] you see it's always selfishness
[1:52:58] it's always lack of humility that's the
[1:53:00] problem
[1:53:01] that's why the nearer Kinsmen which is a
[1:53:03] type of the devil the nearer Kinsman and
[1:53:05] Boaz as they wouldn't redeem
[1:53:07] Naomi and take Ruth for a wife because
[1:53:10] if he did he would raise up seed to the
[1:53:12] dead and that seed would jeopardize his
[1:53:14] inheritance
[1:53:16] selfishness Boaz Ruth had the character
[1:53:19] of Boaz to give everything for
[1:53:21] Redemption Boaz had the character of
[1:53:23] Ruth he was willing to lose his
[1:53:25] he was willing to give up all of his
[1:53:27] inheritance for Redemption it's like
[1:53:29] Christ Christ's bride has his character
[1:53:32] in Christ has the same character
[1:53:34] they're both willing to give up
[1:53:36] everything for the word
[1:53:41] so now Tamar
[1:53:44] the second son he pulls a trick and he
[1:53:47] refuses to give seed and so God smites
[1:53:49] him dead
[1:53:51] so now the third is too young to marry
[1:53:53] Tamar so Judah says go back to your
[1:53:55] father's house and mourn the death of
[1:53:57] your husband and when this youngest son
[1:54:00] is old enough I'll marry you too but
[1:54:02] then Tamar's there and she's watching
[1:54:04] from afar and and she's a widow and
[1:54:06] she's in her father's house but yet she
[1:54:08] has a right to that lineage
[1:54:11] which is what Christ she has a right to
[1:54:14] Christ
[1:54:15] I want you to look at this because she
[1:54:18] was married into that linen she became
[1:54:19] one with the oldest son she has a right
[1:54:22] to Christ
[1:54:24] so there's a motivation in her to bring
[1:54:27] forth this sea and it's it's her
[1:54:29] motivation she has a a legal right to
[1:54:31] Christ
[1:54:33] but when the youngest son comes of age
[1:54:35] she is not given to that son to wife
[1:54:38] she's withheld and she now knows this
[1:54:40] that he he he's he's not keeping his end
[1:54:43] of the deal but she has a right to
[1:54:45] Christ
[1:54:46] I want you to get this in your head to
[1:54:48] understand where Tamar's thinking is and
[1:54:51] what her motivation is there is a law in
[1:54:53] the laws of God that she can bear the
[1:54:56] firstborn son the lineage of Christ
[1:54:58] because she was married to the firstborn
[1:55:00] of Judah and they've denied her that
[1:55:02] right but it's still her right
[1:55:07] so Genesis 38 and 13.
[1:55:13] and it was told Tamar saying Behold thy
[1:55:15] father-in-law goeth up to Timnath to
[1:55:18] Shear a sheep
[1:55:19] and she put her widow's garments off
[1:55:21] from her and covered her with a veil and
[1:55:23] wrapped herself and sat in an open place
[1:55:25] which is by the way to Timnath for she
[1:55:28] saw that Sheila was grown and she was
[1:55:31] not given unto him to wife
[1:55:33] when Judah saw her he thought her to be
[1:55:36] a harlot because she had covered her
[1:55:38] face
[1:55:39] and he turned into her by the way and
[1:55:41] said go to I pray thee let me come in
[1:55:43] unto thee for he knew not that she was
[1:55:46] his daughter-in-law and she said what
[1:55:47] will thou give me that thou mayest come
[1:55:49] in unto me
[1:55:51] so we see the whole scenario she now
[1:55:53] goes and she she dresses herself and
[1:55:57] covers her face and sets in a place
[1:55:59] where Judah believes her to be a harlot
[1:56:01] and and now he believing she's the heart
[1:56:05] that makes a deal and and he joins with
[1:56:08] her and she becomes pregnant
[1:56:11] and you say that's a horrible thing
[1:56:15] we're going to find out if it's a
[1:56:16] horrible thing or not
[1:56:18] let's go to verse 24.
[1:56:22] and it came to pass about three months
[1:56:24] after that it was told Judas saying
[1:56:26] Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played
[1:56:28] the Harlot and also behold she is with
[1:56:30] child by whoredom and Judah said bring
[1:56:33] her forth and let her be burned
[1:56:35] when she was brought forth she she sent
[1:56:38] to her father-in-law saying by the man
[1:56:41] whose these are am I with child so in
[1:56:44] the deal he was going to pay her a kid
[1:56:46] of the of the goats but in the meantime
[1:56:49] she says what will you give me for
[1:56:50] Surety and he gave a bracelet a Signet
[1:56:52] ring and a staff
[1:56:53] and so now she sins ahead the bracelet
[1:56:56] the Signet ring and the staff
[1:56:59] and now Judah is going to realize
[1:57:01] this is me
[1:57:03] she's received seed from me
[1:57:07] and so let's read that again
[1:57:11] verse 25 when she was brought forth she
[1:57:13] sent to her father-in-law saying by the
[1:57:15] man whose these are am I with child and
[1:57:18] she said discern I pray that whose are
[1:57:20] these the Signet the bracelets and the
[1:57:22] staff
[1:57:23] and Judah acknowledged them and said she
[1:57:26] hath been more righteous than I
[1:57:30] because that I gave her not to Sheila my
[1:57:32] son and knew and he knew her not again
[1:57:35] no more
[1:57:38] you look at this and you say
[1:57:41] what was timna doing
[1:57:43] or what was Tamar doing
[1:57:45] what was she doing she was putting her
[1:57:48] life in jeopardy
[1:57:50] she was doing something that would be
[1:57:53] misunderstood by multitudes of people
[1:57:56] and I tell you there's probably been
[1:57:58] multitudes of Christians who've read
[1:57:59] that Bible and still don't understand
[1:58:01] what Tamar did
[1:58:03] you understand what I'm saying but Tamar
[1:58:05] was not interested in an illicit
[1:58:08] relationship she wasn't interested in
[1:58:10] pleasure with a man
[1:58:12] do you understand this she wasn't there
[1:58:14] for she wasn't there amen just to excite
[1:58:17] herself or to bring pleasure to herself
[1:58:19] she was there because she had a right to
[1:58:21] Christ and she didn't know how to else
[1:58:23] to get Christ Christ's being was being
[1:58:24] withheld from her so she did whatever it
[1:58:27] took to get back to the original source
[1:58:29] of the seed
[1:58:30] and that was Judah
[1:58:34] she wasn't being a harlot she was more
[1:58:37] righteous than Judah
[1:58:39] she did something that looked
[1:58:41] unrighteous to be righteous
[1:58:45] what she did looked wrong but it was
[1:58:47] right
[1:58:49] how was it right it looked so wrong how
[1:58:52] is this right it's right not because
[1:58:55] it's right because the motive is right
[1:58:57] it's right because the intention is
[1:58:59] right it's right because the word is
[1:59:01] right
[1:59:06] so many of our decisions have been
[1:59:09] misunderstood
[1:59:10] why we've moved and left family and
[1:59:13] moved across the country moved to other
[1:59:15] cities left jobs Amen to be part of a
[1:59:17] church
[1:59:19] and and you have been accused of
[1:59:22] harlotry
[1:59:24] if somebody says you follow a false
[1:59:26] Doctrine that's harlotry
[1:59:30] you're following after a man that's
[1:59:31] harlotry
[1:59:33] okay we're all on the same page
[1:59:36] we've been accused of harlotry
[1:59:40] believing the wrong thing receiving the
[1:59:42] wrong seed from the wrong source
[1:59:45] it looks bad when you leave your family
[1:59:48] it looks bad when you pack up and go
[1:59:50] across the country across the state into
[1:59:53] another state it looks bad when you give
[1:59:54] up a good paying job
[1:59:56] it looks like you've gone too far
[1:59:59] looks like you're too extreme
[2:00:01] it looks like when you left your
[2:00:03] father's Church in your mother's church
[2:00:04] and your grandfather and grandmother's
[2:00:05] Church it looks like when you denounce
[2:00:07] the things you were taught all your life
[2:00:08] is wrong
[2:00:10] it looks like when you question
[2:00:12] the marriages that are around you and
[2:00:15] you look like the bad one
[2:00:18] and Tamar looked like the bad one
[2:00:21] but she was the one in the whole story
[2:00:24] who was right
[2:00:26] why she had a right to Christ and she
[2:00:30] was going to give everything to have
[2:00:33] Christ
[2:00:36] Ruth very well could have looked like
[2:00:38] the bad one
[2:00:40] but Ruth was willing to give up
[2:00:42] everything
[2:00:44] to have Christ
[2:00:46] she was right her motive was pure her
[2:00:49] intentions were correct even though what
[2:00:51] she did looked bad
[2:00:54] Esther did something different than all
[2:00:57] the other women and it may he may have
[2:00:59] been mocked she may have been questioned
[2:01:01] she may have had little snide remarks
[2:01:03] how plain she was or how she wasn't
[2:01:05] going to be noticed by the king she
[2:01:07] wasn't going to stick with old fuddy
[2:01:09] duddy hege
[2:01:12] it looked like she was wrong but she was
[2:01:14] the one who was right
[2:01:17] so the question is what does it take to
[2:01:19] be right
[2:01:20] in order to be right you don't always
[2:01:22] look right
[2:01:26] it's not because everybody says you look
[2:01:28] right
[2:01:29] many times in the Bible to be right you
[2:01:31] look wrong Paul the masses looked like
[2:01:34] he was wrong
[2:01:36] he left the traditions of the fathers he
[2:01:39] left they thought he left Moses
[2:01:42] he was accused of leaving Moses and he
[2:01:44] never left Moses he went to the
[2:01:45] Fulfillment of Moses
[2:01:47] he went to what Moses was teaching he
[2:01:50] never left Moses but they thought he
[2:01:51] left Moses
[2:01:56] they misunderstood his intentions they
[2:01:58] misunderstood his motives they
[2:01:59] misunderstood his actions and and he
[2:02:02] says he tells the king he says I confess
[2:02:05] and the way that is called heresy
[2:02:09] is the way that I worship to God on my
[2:02:11] father he he had a a name of idolatry
[2:02:14] attached to him
[2:02:17] he had a bad name attached to him he
[2:02:20] looked like an outcast a renegade a
[2:02:22] rebel uh whatever
[2:02:25] and being in prison multiple times
[2:02:27] didn't change the other people's opinion
[2:02:29] of him
[2:02:32] it just reinforced what they already
[2:02:33] thought
[2:02:34] but Paul was the one who was right and
[2:02:37] they were wrong
[2:02:41] I hope a picture's emerging
[2:02:44] that I am not going to get to Redemption
[2:02:48] a halfway believer
[2:02:51] and I'm not going to get to Redemption
[2:02:53] always trying to look good in the eyes
[2:02:56] of everybody else
[2:02:59] but if I'm going to go all the way into
[2:03:01] the seventh seal
[2:03:03] and if I'm going to go all the way to
[2:03:05] Christ in this day
[2:03:08] it may look bad to some
[2:03:10] it may look dark and it may look wrong
[2:03:14] and it may look like all kinds of things
[2:03:16] but if my motive is pure and the word is
[2:03:20] behind me and I'm laying my life down
[2:03:23] for the word for Redemption then you're
[2:03:25] going to see that it will be
[2:03:27] righteousness attributed unto me
[2:03:30] why because I didn't go for myself and
[2:03:33] not for pleasure not for sensuality amen
[2:03:36] not with my own ideas but a surrender to
[2:03:39] the word to come to the Redeemer himself
[2:03:42] and have him in me that's the whole goal
[2:03:46] and if that's the whole goal then we're
[2:03:49] going to have to go all the way
[2:03:52] all the way
[2:03:54] this isn't going to be Sunday Wednesday
[2:03:55] this is not Sunday Wednesday
[2:03:58] this is life
[2:04:00] this is not church this is life this is
[2:04:03] not when I'm with other believers this
[2:04:04] is like this is you cannot do this
[2:04:07] partial you'll wind up in the house of
[2:04:09] the concubines
[2:04:15] it was
[2:04:17] it was the king oh God help us
[2:04:20] please God
[2:04:23] it was the king
[2:04:25] ahazarus who Vindicated Esther
[2:04:30] by sowing his seed in her
[2:04:32] and receiving her his wife
[2:04:35] it was Boaz who Vindicated the actions
[2:04:39] of Ruth
[2:04:40] by taking her as wife
[2:04:43] it was Judah who Vindicated the actions
[2:04:46] of Tamar by declaring her more righteous
[2:04:48] than himself
[2:04:51] they couldn't vindicate themselves
[2:04:54] they couldn't prove themselves they
[2:04:56] couldn't defend themselves
[2:04:59] but it was always the Christ that they
[2:05:01] were coming to
[2:05:03] the Christ that they laid themselves
[2:05:04] down to and gave themselves up for it
[2:05:07] was always that Christ that was their
[2:05:08] vindication
[2:05:10] the king Vindicated Boaz Vindicated and
[2:05:13] Judah if Judah had said differently she
[2:05:16] would have been burnt
[2:05:17] if Boaz had said differently she would
[2:05:20] have been stoned
[2:05:21] if the king had said differently she'd
[2:05:23] be moved in the house
[2:05:25] of the concubines
[2:05:27] but each one of these women were putting
[2:05:29] their whole life basing it on the word
[2:05:31] but putting their whole life in the
[2:05:33] hands of the man that they came to unite
[2:05:35] with
[2:05:38] and I have no interest in playing the
[2:05:40] part of a harlot and I have no interest
[2:05:42] in being a concubine
[2:05:44] it doesn't interest me at all
[2:05:46] what I'm interested in is redemption
[2:05:48] that seventh seal the person of Christ
[2:05:51] himself and I want to get all the way to
[2:05:53] him and I don't want to go with my idea
[2:05:55] or my concept or with a clean reputation
[2:05:57] I just want to get to him
[2:05:59] if I got to lay at his feet at night if
[2:06:01] I've got to look like a hearted if I got
[2:06:03] to do whatever I just want to get to him
[2:06:05] regardless what everybody thinks about
[2:06:06] my actions my actions are pure
[2:06:09] because my heart is pure because he's my
[2:06:11] goal
[2:06:14] and he will vindicate her
[2:06:20] there's nothing they can do to vindicate
[2:06:22] themselves there's nothing you could do
[2:06:23] to make him choose and there's nothing
[2:06:25] you can do to vindicate yourself
[2:06:28] all you can do is wait for him to
[2:06:30] vindicate you
[2:06:32] oh I'm so thankful
[2:06:36] I'm thankful and fearful that I live in
[2:06:38] this day
[2:06:40] because the age of excuses are gone the
[2:06:42] gauge of partial understanding is gone
[2:06:44] winking an eye winking at ignorance is
[2:06:46] gone
[2:06:47] the word has come now he's looking for
[2:06:50] the one who will surrender to the word
[2:06:51] and give herself up for this word
[2:06:55] and that's who I want to be
[2:06:59] will we be misunderstood yes
[2:07:02] yes
[2:07:04] be falsely accused yes
[2:07:08] Bank on it
[2:07:10] may be mocked and sneered a little bit
[2:07:12] for being too plain or whatever
[2:07:17] it doesn't matter
[2:07:20] because I'm not here
[2:07:22] to be in the house that concubines
[2:07:24] and I'm not here to be admired by the
[2:07:26] concubines I'm not here to be admired by
[2:07:29] The Other Women I am here for Redemption
[2:07:32] purposes
[2:07:33] and I'm here to lay myself down at his
[2:07:36] feet
[2:07:38] and wait there
[2:07:40] until he takes me into himself
[2:07:43] not trying to entice him by my good
[2:07:45] deeds
[2:07:46] not trying to entice him by my great
[2:07:48] gifts or my wonderful accomplishments
[2:07:51] and in a talent show that's going to win
[2:07:54] the heart of the king
[2:07:56] it's not a resume
[2:07:58] it's got all kinds of accomplishment in
[2:08:00] accolades that's not going to win the
[2:08:01] heart of the king
[2:08:02] humble submissive heart humble to the
[2:08:05] word that's going to win the heart of
[2:08:07] the king
[2:08:08] when I lay down my word my reputation my
[2:08:11] life and I put it all on the line
[2:08:15] to have him
[2:08:21] live in
[2:08:22] everything else
[2:08:24] is going to go the wrong way
[2:08:28] let's all stand
[2:08:30] I'm not going to preach anymore
[2:08:39] I'll tell you more than anything I want
[2:08:40] my motives to be right
[2:08:44] I
[2:08:46] I may not be able to
[2:08:49] I don't know I may not be able to do
[2:08:50] much
[2:08:51] I can't prove anything
[2:08:54] I can't
[2:08:55] I can't produce anything
[2:08:57] but oh if I could just make my motives
[2:09:00] right
[2:09:01] put my eyes on the right price and be
[2:09:03] willing to pay any prize to have price
[2:09:06] to have that prize
[2:09:08] then I know everything's going to work
[2:09:09] out because I trust that hege I was the
[2:09:13] king servant
[2:09:15] do you trust that haggy I was the king
[2:09:16] servant
[2:09:18] and I trust the character of the king
[2:09:21] that sent this servant to prepare the
[2:09:23] bride
[2:09:24] I trust him I trust the character of the
[2:09:27] king if the king sent this servant to
[2:09:29] prepare me for my meeting with him then
[2:09:32] this servant is the one who will get me
[2:09:34] prepared
[2:09:35] and I trust the character the king that
[2:09:37] will take responsibility for his choice
[2:09:39] and a servant
[2:09:42] so that I can trust the servant and
[2:09:45] entrusting the servant I trust the
[2:09:46] character of that King
[2:09:49] to say this is what your servant said do
[2:09:52] I'm not here of my own thinking I'm not
[2:09:54] hearing my own accord I'm here because
[2:09:56] this is what the word says
[2:09:59] and I trust the character of this King
[2:10:01] that if I come according to his word
[2:10:03] with the right motive with the right
[2:10:05] heart and I surrender all for him I
[2:10:07] trust the character of this King that he
[2:10:10] will not try me for a harlot he will not
[2:10:12] expose me as a wrong woman and he will
[2:10:14] not send me to the house of the
[2:10:15] concubines
[2:10:17] but that he will put his seed in me and
[2:10:21] make me one with him and I'll be married
[2:10:23] to the seventh seal caring within me the
[2:10:27] seventh seal the person of the word
[2:10:30] anything short of that is failure
[2:10:35] oh it's the
[2:10:37] I can say it this way
[2:10:40] it's the greatest treasure that's ever
[2:10:41] been on this Earth that's been allowed
[2:10:44] to the Gentile bride
[2:10:46] it's the greatest treasure that we could
[2:10:48] achieve
[2:10:49] is Union with all of Christ
[2:10:52] a full measure of Christ poured into his
[2:10:54] church
[2:10:54] this is the greatest measure
[2:10:57] but the greatest treasure might require
[2:10:59] the greatest sacrifice
[2:11:01] it might just take me giving up
[2:11:04] everything
[2:11:06] to win that prize
[2:11:08] and laying aside every weight and sin
[2:11:11] that besets and forgetting everything
[2:11:12] that lay behind and pressing towards a
[2:11:14] mark it may just take everything moving
[2:11:17] away and this one thing becoming
[2:11:19] everything to me
[2:11:21] and I trust the character of that King
[2:11:24] and sending the right servant to prepare
[2:11:27] me to come the right way and if I do it
[2:11:29] according to his word I trust his
[2:11:31] character not to reject me
[2:11:33] but that he will vindicate me and not
[2:11:37] have me tried for the wrong kind of
[2:11:38] woman
[2:11:39] but say this one's righteous
[2:11:43] I don't care what you thought I don't
[2:11:45] care what your opinion was but I know
[2:11:47] what that heart is and I know what that
[2:11:49] motive is and this one is righteous
[2:11:52] that's where I put my confidence
[2:11:55] all those other women could convince
[2:11:57] with each other they look great
[2:11:59] In The House of the women in haggai they
[2:12:02] could all be convinced you're beautiful
[2:12:03] you're gorgeous you're this you're that
[2:12:05] oh he'll love your voice oh he'll love
[2:12:07] your hair all
[2:12:10] but at the end of the day it didn't
[2:12:11] matter
[2:12:13] all that mattered is the one that
[2:12:14] pleased the King was the one he chose
[2:12:18] and I want to please the king
[2:12:20] amen let's bow our heads and musicians
[2:12:22] if you'll come
[2:12:24] dear heavenly father we thank you Lord
[2:12:26] Jesus for this day you've given us to
[2:12:28] live
[2:12:29] and oh God how
[2:12:32] what a great time
[2:12:34] and what a terrible time
[2:12:37] God while you're drawing and calling
[2:12:40] your bride to a position she's never
[2:12:42] been in before
[2:12:44] giving eye Salve that opens our eyes
[2:12:46] like never before
[2:12:48] at the same time that's going on Gross
[2:12:50] darkness is darker than it's ever been
[2:12:53] millions are falling darker into into
[2:12:56] religion and the more the darkness of
[2:12:58] the world and
[2:12:59] especially in religion
[2:13:03] but it's the greatest time for us
[2:13:06] God I pray you'd help us Lord to
[2:13:08] surrender all
[2:13:10] help us to come Lord to the right place
[2:13:13] at the right time lord the right way

[2:13:39] vindication
[2:13:41] but God you alone are my vindication
[2:13:45] your choice your selection of me you're
[2:13:48] uniting with me that is your Vindication
[2:13:51] vindicating me and that's the only one
[2:13:54] that matters

[2:14:15] Lord we've come to your feet in humility
[2:14:19] because we realize we're not even worthy
[2:14:21] to be your servants
[2:14:23] we're not even worthy in ourselves for
[2:14:25] what we're asking for but we come Lord
[2:14:28] as your servants humbly at your feet
[2:14:31] and we're asking that you would play the
[2:14:33] part of the Kinsmen Redeemer and cover
[2:14:35] us with your skirts

[2:14:39] right way with the right humility
[2:14:41] and surrendering all to have you that

[2:14:47] but that you'll play the part of the
[2:14:49] Kinsmen Redeemer and you'll pick us up
[2:14:50] off the ground
[2:14:52] and that you'll pour out to us the full
[2:14:55] measure of the word and then you'll give
[2:14:56] to us of yourself
[2:14:58] redeeming us and claiming us and
[2:15:01] vindicating us for your own
[2:15:04] I love you father and I ask that you
[2:15:06] would help us Lord
[2:15:08] God help us to move away from anything
[2:15:11] that's partial in our lives
[2:15:14] any halting between two opinions
[2:15:18] any taking of our own idea

[2:15:23] and remove it from us
[2:15:25] for God we don't want to fall from the
[2:15:27] deception of Darkness of our own
