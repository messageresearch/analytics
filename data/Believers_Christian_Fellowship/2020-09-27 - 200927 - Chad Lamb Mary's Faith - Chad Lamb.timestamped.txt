[0:14] is
[0:23] [Music]
[0:27] praise god man god bless you this
[0:30] morning
[0:31] and while we're standing let's take our
[0:32] bibles and turn
[0:35] to the book of luke chapter one
[0:38] i just want to remind you that brother
[0:40] ben siebel and his family are away this
[0:42] week and he's praise preaching
[0:44] down in arkansas for brother david
[0:46] morris to just remember him in prayer
[0:48] for this morning and then further
[0:50] traveling back either
[0:52] i think monday night or tuesday so don't
[0:54] forget them
[0:56] and let's look here and we'll just read
[0:58] a couple verses and then we'll pray
[1:01] luke chapter 1 verse 26
[1:08] and in the sixth month the angel gabriel
[1:10] was sent from god into a city
[1:13] of galilee named nazareth to a virgin
[1:16] espoused to a man whose name was joseph
[1:18] of the house of david and the virgin's
[1:20] name was mary
[1:22] and the angel came in unto her and said
[1:23] hail thou art highly favored the lord is
[1:26] with thee
[1:27] blessed out there among women women
[1:30] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[1:33] his saying and cast in her mind what
[1:35] manner
[1:35] of salutation this should be and the
[1:38] angel said unto her fear not mary
[1:40] for thou hast found favor with god
[1:43] let's bow our heads to pray
[1:46] lord jesus we thank you father for this
[1:50] wonderful opportunity lord that you've
[1:52] given us to be here this morning
[1:54] and lord may we not waste this time that
[1:56] we have but may we glean from it all
[1:58] that you have for us
[1:59] lord we come now to the to the time lord
[2:02] where you can speak to us through the
[2:04] preaching of your word and that's what
[2:06] we've come for lord to worship you
[2:08] with the believers lord and also to hear
[2:10] you lord speak to us directly
[2:13] speak to our needs speak to our
[2:14] questions lord
[2:16] god i pray that you would just give us
[2:17] the word of life that we so desperately
[2:19] hunger for
[2:20] now you might use that word to shape us
[2:22] and mold us into your very nature and
[2:24] character
[2:25] and you might give us what we need for
[2:27] this journey that we're on
[2:28] we pray you take preeminence and take
[2:30] every part of the service
[2:32] into your control in jesus christ's name
[2:34] we pray
[2:35] amen you can all have your seats
[2:39] i'm going to
[2:42] preach on if we'd like to take for a
[2:45] text mary's faith
[2:46] and talk about mary's faith and these
[2:48] are things that we've been discussing
[2:50] here for several weeks
[2:51] we're not going off in a different
[2:52] direction we're staying in that same
[2:54] vein
[2:55] because this is what the lord's laid on
[2:57] my heart and many times i've made
[2:59] apologies in the past for going back and
[3:02] covering a subject again or preaching
[3:03] something that we've touched on before
[3:05] but i'm not going to do that anymore
[3:07] i promised myself i wouldn't do that
[3:09] because god is
[3:10] always showing us something out of his
[3:12] word we read the same message books we
[3:14] listen to the same tapes
[3:16] amen we read the same bible over and
[3:17] over again and god's constantly
[3:19] unfolding
[3:20] and there's a purpose and there's a
[3:21] reason why god laid this on my heart so
[3:23] hard
[3:24] so so let's look at this together as we
[3:26] talk about mary's faith
[3:28] now when we we get here in luke chapter
[3:30] one
[3:31] we find that mary brother bam tells us
[3:33] she's you know between 15 and
[3:35] 16 17 years old somewhere a very very
[3:38] young
[3:39] woman and she's preparing for marriage
[3:41] she's a spouse to a man
[3:43] named joseph and she's got all her plans
[3:45] and all her thinking
[3:47] and she's mapping out her future i mean
[3:49] just normal life what a normal
[3:51] uh young woman would be thinking as
[3:52] she's preparing for the day she's going
[3:54] to be married
[3:55] thinking about children on a home and
[3:57] being a wife and
[3:58] all these other things but there's going
[4:00] to come a messenger from god that's
[4:02] going to interrupt her plans
[4:04] because god has other plans for her amen
[4:08] and we know whenever we read the
[4:09] scripture amen the scripture is not
[4:12] for over here and over there and for
[4:14] yesterday or tomorrow
[4:15] but the scriptures for now to give us
[4:18] something for now
[4:19] so i want to i want to read this again
[4:21] let's start back here at
[4:23] verse 28 and the angel came in
[4:26] unto her and said hail thou that are
[4:29] highly favored
[4:31] the lord is with thee blessed are thou
[4:33] among women
[4:34] now just if we could put ourselves in
[4:36] mary's place if that would happen to us
[4:38] today
[4:39] oh my what an experience amen what an
[4:42] experience to have an angel from the
[4:43] lord come and tell you
[4:44] that you're highly favored thou art
[4:47] highly favored the lord is with thee
[4:49] blessed art among women
[4:51] we would be amazed upon amazed
[4:53] astonished on top of astonished
[4:55] amen totally taken back but this wasn't
[4:58] the end of his message
[5:00] it was just the beginning and when she
[5:02] saw him
[5:03] she was troubled at his saying and cast
[5:05] in her mind what manner of salutation
[5:08] this should be and the angel said unto
[5:10] her fear not mary for thou hast found
[5:12] favor with god
[5:13] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[5:15] womb
[5:17] and bring forth a son and shall call his
[5:19] name jesus
[5:20] he shall be great and shall be called
[5:21] the son of the highest
[5:23] and the lord god shall give unto him the
[5:25] throne of his father david
[5:26] and he shall reign over the house of
[5:28] jacob forever and of his kingdom there
[5:30] shall be no
[5:31] end then said mary unto the angel how
[5:33] shall this be
[5:34] seeing i know not a man. and the angel
[5:37] answered and said unto her the holy
[5:38] ghost shall come upon thee
[5:40] and the power of the highest shall
[5:42] overshadow thee therefore also that holy
[5:44] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[5:46] be called
[5:47] the son of god. and behold thy cousin
[5:49] elizabeth she hath also conceived a son
[5:52] in her old age
[5:53] and this is the sixth month with her who
[5:55] was called barren
[5:56] for with god nothing shall be impossible
[5:59] and mary said behold the handmaid of the
[6:01] lord
[6:02] be it unto me according to thy word and
[6:04] the angel departed from her
[6:07] so we know that we've been through this
[6:09] everybody knows this story everybody who
[6:11] has any association with christianity
[6:13] but we realize that this is an amazing
[6:16] event
[6:17] in this woman's life amen we read it as
[6:19] a bible story as something we've heard
[6:21] before
[6:22] but this is an outstanding happening in
[6:24] her life
[6:25] amen and when this angel comes and
[6:27] speaks to her he's telling her thou art
[6:29] highly favored thou art chosen the lord
[6:31] is with thee
[6:32] amen and you're going to be the one the
[6:35] vessel that god uses to fulfill his
[6:37] prophecy out of isaiah
[6:38] a virgin shall conceive and you realize
[6:42] that when when mary you know she asked
[6:44] the question
[6:45] how how will that work since i don't
[6:47] know a man amen
[6:49] he gives her an answer that doesn't
[6:51] satisfy
[6:52] intellect because she's asking a
[6:55] legitimate question
[6:57] how shall i have a child if i don't know
[6:59] a man and he's saying
[7:00] the holy ghost shall overshadow you amen
[7:03] there's going to be a power that come
[7:04] upon you and you're going to conceive in
[7:06] your womb
[7:06] amen and she doesn't when she asks the
[7:09] question
[7:10] she doesn't get a reason she doesn't get
[7:12] anything reasoning or anything
[7:14] reasonable that comes
[7:15] back she doesn't actually get an
[7:17] explanation of how it will work
[7:21] but she gets an answer from the
[7:23] messenger
[7:24] and the answer from the angel satisfies
[7:26] something inside of her
[7:28] and she says that's the truth be it unto
[7:30] me according to your word
[7:33] amen showing to have the kind of faith
[7:35] mary has
[7:36] you don't have to have evidence and
[7:38] proof and scientific fact
[7:40] amen all you have to have is the word
[7:42] amen this is what's going to happen this
[7:44] is going to be the work of the holy
[7:46] ghost and she's able to say
[7:47] all right that doesn't explain amen
[7:50] conception the way i understand
[7:51] conception that doesn't explain
[7:53] amen but it explains satisfy something
[7:56] in my heart
[7:56] if you say it it's truth and i receive
[7:59] it as truth in the name of jesus christ
[8:02] she didn't say that part i say that part
[8:06] because you realize for us there are
[8:09] some
[8:09] outstanding things that have been said
[8:11] about you
[8:13] some there's been an angel messenger
[8:15] that is coming this day
[8:16] and he's speaking to the bride amen and
[8:19] this is not the time for group
[8:21] thinking this is the time for individual
[8:23] god speaking to me
[8:25] this messenger was sent to me that voice
[8:27] on that tape
[8:28] is to me because if we don't take it
[8:31] that way we're going to miss the point
[8:32] of this age that we're in
[8:34] that missed the point of this move of
[8:36] god this is not a church move this is an
[8:38] individual move
[8:40] this is not i mean the message came to
[8:42] all the bride but it came to call out
[8:44] this one here
[8:45] and this one here and that one here not
[8:47] a whole group
[8:50] and so now if you take it that way amen
[8:53] this angel
[8:54] from the lord has said some outstanding
[8:56] things about you
[9:00] and my question is what's our response
[9:02] to those
[9:03] statements
[9:07] i mean there's nothing wrong with
[9:08] wondering how how is that
[9:10] how could that be how could that be
[9:15] but sometimes when you listen to the
[9:16] message the answer you get back
[9:18] amen doesn't go through genealogy no
[9:20] technical no reasoning
[9:22] it just says it's the holy ghost calling
[9:24] you out amen
[9:25] if you've heard the if you've heard his
[9:26] voice amen you heard the eagle screen
[9:28] you're an eagle you say amen
[9:30] what did that explain it didn't explain
[9:32] a whole lot but something inside of you
[9:34] had the capacity to say that's the truth
[9:39] let's keep reading here in verse 39
[9:44] and mary arose in those days and went
[9:46] into the hill country with haste into a
[9:48] city of judah
[9:49] and entered into the house of zacharias
[9:51] and saluted elizabeth
[9:53] and it came to pass that when elizabeth
[9:55] heard the salutation of mary
[9:57] the baby leaped in her womb leapt in her
[9:59] womb and elizabeth was filled with the
[10:01] holy ghost and she spake out
[10:03] with a loud voice and said blessed art
[10:04] thou among women and blessed is the
[10:06] fruit of thy womb
[10:08] and when says this to me that the mother
[10:10] of my lord shall come to me
[10:12] and lo as soon as the voice of the
[10:13] salutation sounded in my ears the babe
[10:16] leapt in my womb for joy and blessed is
[10:19] she
[10:20] this is verse 45 i want you to focus on
[10:22] and blessed is she
[10:23] that believed blessed is she that
[10:26] believed
[10:27] for there shall be perform there shall
[10:29] be a performance
[10:31] of those things which were told her from
[10:33] the lord
[10:35] now god brother ben tells us it's very
[10:39] clear through the scripture god tells us
[10:41] in his plan that god works with man and
[10:43] god has never
[10:44] forced anything but he's given his word
[10:47] and given his people an
[10:48] opportunity to respond to the word and
[10:50] that's response to the word
[10:52] often indicates what seeds on the inside
[10:56] and so now he comes to mary gabriel
[10:59] comes to mary sent from the presence of
[11:00] the lord and begins
[11:02] to tell her who she is
[11:06] what scriptures she's going to fulfill
[11:10] and how that god is going to use the
[11:12] power of the holy ghost to bring this to
[11:13] pass in her life
[11:16] and and now she
[11:19] now that the angel has come god has
[11:22] i get you could say this way god has
[11:24] given her a true message
[11:26] and now waiting for her response
[11:30] and her response was be it unto me
[11:32] according to thy word
[11:33] she believed what the angel told her
[11:36] she didn't have to go talk to her pastor
[11:39] she didn't have to go see a priest
[11:40] she didn't have to get a counsel
[11:42] together she didn't have to go back to
[11:43] mom and dad
[11:44] but she as an individual when she heard
[11:47] the messenger speak to her and identify
[11:50] her
[11:50] and place her in the word and tell her
[11:53] she's the fulfillment of that scripture
[11:54] she as an individual with no outside
[11:57] help had something in her that could say
[11:59] that's the truth be it unto me that's
[12:02] for me
[12:06] and now when she comes to elizabeth
[12:08] elizabeth is filled with the holy ghost
[12:10] begins to speak and prophesy out
[12:12] amen and she has to prophesy out because
[12:15] her husband's smitten dumb because he
[12:17] can no longer speak
[12:18] because he was in the ministry amen and
[12:20] gabriel came to him
[12:22] first amen with a message for him that
[12:24] he's going to receive a child
[12:26] and he doubted it he questioned it
[12:30] and he didn't just question it but he
[12:32] questioned it and doubted it
[12:33] mary questioned it but not doubt
[12:40] and when elizabeth filled the holy ghost
[12:42] is speaking because the ministry now is
[12:45] dumb because they doubted
[12:48] so now the woman's speaking because
[12:50] she's the final voice to the final age
[12:54] all the denominational ministry all the
[12:55] theologians all the schools of theology
[12:57] they're smitten dumb and can no longer
[12:59] speak to the bride
[13:01] amen because they doubted the angel
[13:04] messenger
[13:07] and what part did they doubt they
[13:09] doubted listen close
[13:12] they doubted the message of the
[13:15] forerunner
[13:17] they doubted the coming of the
[13:19] forerunner
[13:21] and when they doubted the coming of the
[13:23] forerunner they were smitten dumb
[13:25] amen but elizabeth who had received the
[13:28] forerunner ministry
[13:29] amen was filled with the holy ghost and
[13:31] could recognize now
[13:33] moving from the messenger to his message
[13:39] she could catch it by the power of the
[13:40] holy ghost and now she now is declaring
[13:43] and blessed blessed is she that believed
[13:48] for there shall be a performance of
[13:50] those things which are told her from the
[13:51] lord
[13:53] see the way it's written i mean it's
[13:55] very unique and the fact is
[13:56] she had to accept it she had to believe
[13:59] it amen and she believed it and there
[14:01] shall
[14:02] be a performance of those things amen
[14:04] because god
[14:05] requires faith he requires that we
[14:07] believe his word and when we believe his
[14:09] word he goes to act upon his word
[14:11] god was always there with the power to
[14:13] perform his word
[14:15] but he's got to have somebody that will
[14:17] believe it
[14:21] let's go back and look at chapter 1
[14:24] verse 11.
[14:25] let's go back to zacharias
[14:33] 11. and there appeared unto him an angel
[14:36] of the lord standing on the right side
[14:38] of the altar of incense and when
[14:40] zechariah saw him
[14:41] he was troubled and fearful upon him but
[14:44] the angel said unto him fear not
[14:45] zacharias
[14:46] for thy prayer is heard
[14:50] this is this is such a sad part of the
[14:52] story
[14:53] zacharias has been praying for a child
[14:57] and he says thy prayer is heard
[15:00] and my wife elizabeth shall bear thee a
[15:02] son and thou shalt call his name
[15:03] john and thou shalt have joy and
[15:05] gladness and many shall rejoice at his
[15:07] birth
[15:07] for he shall be great in the sight of
[15:09] the lord and shall drink neither
[15:11] wine nor strong drink and he shall be
[15:13] filled with the holy ghost even from his
[15:15] mother's womb
[15:16] and many of the children of israel shall
[15:18] he turn to the lord their god
[15:20] and he shall go before him in the spirit
[15:22] and power of elias
[15:23] to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[15:25] children and the disobedient to the
[15:26] wisdom of the just
[15:28] to make already a people prepare
[15:29] prepared for the lord
[15:31] and zechariah said unto the angel
[15:33] whereby shall i know this for i am an
[15:35] old man
[15:36] and my wife well stricken in years and
[15:38] the angel answered and said unto him i
[15:40] am gabriel that stand in the presence of
[15:42] god
[15:42] and am sent to speak unto thee to show
[15:45] thee these glad tidings and behold thou
[15:48] shalt be dumb and not able to speak
[15:50] until the day that these things shall be
[15:51] performed
[15:52] because thou believest not my words
[15:54] which shall be fulfilled
[15:56] in their season
[15:59] zacharias doubted although he was
[16:02] praying for a son
[16:03] what was told him was so amazing now he
[16:06] begins to question
[16:07] and his question is based on reasoning
[16:11] his questions is based on reasoning i'm
[16:14] old my wife is old
[16:17] as if anything is too hard for god
[16:21] but but he was smitten dumb because he
[16:24] didn't believe
[16:25] brother branham says in the in the
[16:27] message the ministry of christ back in
[16:28] 1953
[16:30] now this little virgin was all excited
[16:32] notice
[16:33] here's what i like about mary instead of
[16:36] doubting like zacharias that preacher
[16:38] she said behold the handsman of the lord
[16:40] be it unto me according to your word
[16:42] she didn't try to figure it all out like
[16:44] he did
[16:47] you know so many people
[16:51] uh they tried to intellectualize the
[16:53] message
[16:55] and i i i want to say make a statement
[16:58] but i make it in no disregard and i
[17:00] don't make it with any
[17:02] ill will whatsoever but you can't
[17:05] apply apologetics technique to the
[17:08] message
[17:08] [Music]
[17:11] because god
[17:14] did not want to make the message so
[17:17] simple
[17:18] that anybody could comprehend it with
[17:20] the human mind
[17:22] and acknowledge it why because he had to
[17:25] like he did all through the scriptures
[17:27] he had to make it by faith so the
[17:30] promise could be sure
[17:32] to the seed so that the only way
[17:35] that you could get a hold of the word of
[17:37] god is to believe it by
[17:39] faith not necessary to understand it by
[17:42] reasoning or by a human mind
[17:45] so although everything we believe is
[17:47] based on the scriptures and we have
[17:49] we have that's the only foundation amen
[17:52] for our faith is the word of god brother
[17:54] branham told us that
[17:56] we believe it but god didn't put it in
[17:58] such a nice neat little
[18:00] package that everybody with the ability
[18:02] to read could read
[18:03] and come up with the same conclusion but
[18:06] he he
[18:06] he so did it in such an odd and unique
[18:09] way
[18:10] that he made it impossible you can't
[18:12] take the message and read it from
[18:14] beginning to end
[18:15] amen and have a clear understanding of
[18:17] what brother branham is saying
[18:22] i mean i don't mean that to disregard
[18:24] brother branham in any way it's the it's
[18:26] the way god wanted to hide
[18:28] it and reveal it in simplicity he
[18:31] he hid it in a man amen that would would
[18:33] give fragments of sentences
[18:35] partial scripture and grab one scripture
[18:38] and read part of it and read another
[18:40] part of a scripture without giving you
[18:41] the reference to that scripture
[18:44] so that you didn't even know he was
[18:45] citing a scripture he put these two
[18:47] thoughts together
[18:48] and spit it out as a package and he will
[18:50] say this is today
[18:52] and it wasn't so neatly done you could
[18:54] say oh he was quoting out of zechariah
[18:56] and that other part was out as isaiah
[18:58] you look at it and it's literally the
[19:00] first time you hear it
[19:01] it says if he made that up himself
[19:06] because god is not looking to tantalize
[19:09] your intellect
[19:10] or your reasoning amen he didn't do it
[19:12] to zechariah he never answered
[19:14] zechariah's question
[19:15] because zechariah's question came from
[19:17] unbelief
[19:20] showing that mary's question didn't come
[19:22] from unbelief
[19:23] she had a question not all questions are
[19:26] unbelief
[19:28] some questions are just questions
[19:31] like i'll tell you this you're going to
[19:33] get a body change this body your atoms
[19:35] are going to change
[19:36] into a glorified condition you can say i
[19:38] wonder how that this body will change
[19:41] that's a good question or you can say
[19:45] how is there going to be abide adam's
[19:47] change i don't get that
[19:50] you understand one's a question like
[19:52] mary asked one's a question like
[19:53] zacharias asked
[19:57] so he's god
[20:01] is looking god is looking for
[20:04] faith he said when the son of man comes
[20:07] will he find
[20:08] faith we've come
[20:11] to you know we've come to a place in
[20:13] society
[20:14] where we've got so much
[20:17] information but god was not going to
[20:20] allow this to be
[20:21] information amen it was going to be by
[20:24] revelation
[20:26] in the age of information
[20:29] it's going to be by revelation so god is
[20:32] hidden and revealed in simplicity
[20:35] it goes back to the same quarter she
[20:36] didn't try to figure it all out like he
[20:38] did why
[20:38] he said now look my my wife sold so
[20:41] forth like this
[20:42] we have plenty of examples look at hagar
[20:44] and the temple look at sarah
[20:46] many of the old women had had had
[20:47] children by god's blessings upon them
[20:49] and he had plenty of examples but she
[20:51] had to he had to believe something she
[20:54] had to believe something that had never
[20:55] happened
[20:56] by the way i'm saying she had a
[20:58] legitimate question
[20:59] zacharias had all kinds of bible
[21:01] examples of god healing bodies
[21:03] opening wombs giving children where
[21:06] there was barrenness amen and zechariah
[21:08] was
[21:09] absolutely disregarding the word
[21:12] he should have known better and then
[21:15] brother and says well
[21:16] here's what i like about mary
[21:20] i want you to grab a hold of this
[21:21] because we're talking about mary's faith
[21:23] here's what i like about mary before she
[21:26] felt life before any physical
[21:29] outward demonstration before there was
[21:32] one thing ceased in her body before she
[21:34] felt life or anything
[21:36] she started out testifying that she was
[21:38] going to have a baby
[21:40] hallelujah god give us some more mary's
[21:43] that'll
[21:44] take god at his word god had said so
[21:46] through his angel
[21:47] didn't make any difference what
[21:49] everything else took place she was going
[21:51] to have a baby
[21:52] because she took god at his word
[21:56] see we want mary's faith amen not
[21:59] zacharias's questioning we want mary's
[22:01] faith that says
[22:02] if that angel said it to me amen what
[22:05] what was the angel speaking he was
[22:06] speaking prophecy he was speaking
[22:08] scripture
[22:09] he was speaking the time amen for the
[22:11] prophecy to be fulfilled
[22:13] and he was pointing at mary and saying
[22:15] you're that amen you're the fulfillment
[22:17] of the prophecy
[22:18] it's the time the time is now it's going
[22:20] to be in you
[22:21] and she had something in her that could
[22:23] respond and say that's nothing but the
[22:25] truth
[22:26] and run and begin to testify to
[22:28] elizabeth immediately
[22:30] before she felt one change in her body
[22:33] to verify
[22:34] that what he said was correct she didn't
[22:37] need another verification
[22:38] her faith was the verification
[22:43] see too many times we're looking for
[22:45] evidences we're trying to
[22:47] prove something we're trying to get
[22:48] somebody on our side we're trying to
[22:51] get all the details lined up instead of
[22:53] just coming god's provided way
[22:55] that he put something inside of you amen
[22:58] there is a crystal that can pick up on
[22:59] his word
[23:02] amen not everybody has that but if you
[23:04] have that amen the word will come to you
[23:06] and before you understand it you'll
[23:08] believe it amen before you can explain
[23:10] it you'll believe it
[23:11] you'll receive it by faith amen because
[23:14] the angel messenger said it
[23:16] amen and it won't be till later that god
[23:18] will back it up with the vindication
[23:20] your body will begin to change
[23:21] amen all the things that come with being
[23:23] impregnated will begin to manifest
[23:25] themselves amen but she didn't wait for
[23:27] that
[23:28] she was so confident that she knew
[23:30] whether the angel told her was true
[23:32] she went to testify of it immediately
[23:37] that's the seed friends that's the seed
[23:42] and elizabeth could say blessed is she
[23:46] that believes
[23:47] for it shall be performed everything
[23:50] that was told
[23:53] now the the this is i'm just laying a
[23:55] foundation i'm painting a picture
[23:56] because there's something
[23:57] remarkable that we want to get to uh
[24:00] here in just a little bit
[24:01] but listen now let's read let's read
[24:03] this quote together i've read this
[24:04] before recently
[24:05] out of the invisible union of the bride
[24:07] of christ and let's take our time it's a
[24:09] long quote but let's take our time
[24:11] now notice the anointed word of this day
[24:14] of which you are apart
[24:16] now there was an anointed word for
[24:19] mary's day and that anointed word was a
[24:20] virgin shall conceive
[24:23] brother bram said isaiah spoke it and
[24:25] that word went around
[24:26] and around the earth waiting to lodge in
[24:29] the womb of a woman
[24:32] and so that word won't fail that word
[24:34] won't fall to the ground
[24:36] and then that void is just keep circling
[24:38] waiting
[24:39] waiting until the right time the right
[24:42] season when the angel messenger will
[24:43] come from the lord
[24:44] when tell a certain virgin girl that
[24:47] she's the one
[24:48] and she as you see there has to be a
[24:50] reciprocal part
[24:52] when the word comes in the manifestation
[24:54] amen god
[24:56] he so worked his program that there's
[24:58] got to be two reciprocal parts
[25:00] amen the angel could not come and he
[25:02] could not stand
[25:04] amen on top of mount uh uh mount moriah
[25:06] he could not stand in the temple
[25:08] and declare real loudly amen that that
[25:11] that that now it's time for the
[25:12] fulfillment of of
[25:14] isaiah's prophecy a virgin shall
[25:16] conceive amen and it's going to happen
[25:18] and i'm going to force my way into it
[25:20] and i'm picking you up and i'm making it
[25:21] happen here
[25:22] he can't do that because the the word
[25:25] has to come
[25:26] to the word he can't just any meanie
[25:30] mighty moan
[25:31] i'm gonna grab you and i'm gonna force
[25:32] this word to come through your life
[25:34] he cannot do that he has never done that
[25:37] nowhere in the scripture has he ever
[25:39] done that amen but he's got to wait for
[25:42] the right
[25:42] season and there's a recipient for that
[25:45] word amen
[25:46] and when those two things come together
[25:48] two omnipotents meet
[25:51] the word comes to the word mary was born
[25:54] she was predestinated she was ordained
[25:57] amen to be the virgin that would bring
[25:59] forth
[26:00] the flesh body of god jesus christ on
[26:03] earth the son of god
[26:04] and it was her allotted to her ordained
[26:07] before the foundation of the world for
[26:09] her
[26:09] it wasn't for anybody else but for her
[26:12] amen but
[26:12] nothing was going to move until she
[26:15] became the reciprocal part of that word
[26:17] she had to receive it by faith
[26:22] so there's a spoken word but when the
[26:24] spoken word goes
[26:25] it goes and goes and goes
[26:29] looking for a lodging place
[26:32] and there's got to be a predestinated
[26:34] lodging place
[26:37] and that word is moving now there's been
[26:39] a prophet messenger in our day
[26:41] spoke the word of god and that word is
[26:43] moving amen and that word
[26:45] has a predestinated lodging place in the
[26:49] elect
[26:49] predestinated seed of god and that word
[26:52] is moving
[26:53] looking for somebody who will say be it
[26:56] unto me that's the truth i believe
[26:59] i am what you say mary wasn't just
[27:02] saying
[27:02] you're a good messenger you are gabriel
[27:05] amen you
[27:06] are and it's time for that that's not
[27:08] what she was saying friends
[27:09] it wasn't saying you're malachi 4. this
[27:12] is luke 17
[27:13] 30. you're the elijah that's not what
[27:15] she was agreeing to
[27:17] friends amen zacharias wasn't doubting
[27:21] gabriel he wasn't doubting that he was
[27:23] an angel
[27:23] come from the presence of the lord he
[27:25] was doubting his part in the mystery
[27:30] so when mary said amen be it unto me
[27:32] according to my words
[27:33] she wasn't saying i agree you're gabriel
[27:36] i agree you're the messenger and i agree
[27:38] the word you say is true
[27:40] she was saying i agree i
[27:43] am the fulfillment of isaiah's prophecy
[27:46] it was a big statement you see friends
[27:48] it wasn't just something that said
[27:50] oh yeah that sounds good amen amen
[27:52] that's the truth amen that's good
[27:54] but she was absolutely actually
[27:55] accepting the fact
[27:57] that when god spoke a word that was in
[27:59] his mind before the foundation of the
[28:01] world that
[28:02] she was the recipient of that word
[28:06] amen this is not agreeing with the
[28:08] message agreeing with the messenger
[28:10] agreeing that brother bran look at those
[28:12] miracles look at those signs
[28:13] obviously he's elijah he did everything
[28:15] he was supposed to be that's the son of
[28:16] man ministry
[28:17] amen that's not the faith that god's
[28:19] looking for in this day
[28:20] he's looking for the faith that mary had
[28:22] that would say you call me bride
[28:25] you say i'm sinless you say that god's
[28:27] gonna bring forth the manifestation of
[28:29] jesus christ through me
[28:31] i'm saying that's the truth and i
[28:33] receive it in the name of jesus
[28:36] it's a much bigger statement than just
[28:39] recognizing
[28:40] that what the messenger says is true
[28:46] there's a lot of people that will
[28:48] believe
[28:50] that there is a prophet
[28:53] do the signs do the works
[28:56] but there come forth a message that has
[28:59] to be received by faith
[29:03] the brotherhood says now notice the
[29:05] anointed word of this day of his day of
[29:07] which you are apart
[29:09] by predestination mary was
[29:12] already a part of that word
[29:16] she just didn't know it yet never been
[29:20] told to her
[29:21] she didn't know she wasn't told when she
[29:23] was a baby you know you're the virgin
[29:26] that's going to bring forth messiah she
[29:29] she wasn't
[29:29] thinking she probably wasn't praying and
[29:32] saying god would you make me the
[29:34] the the tabernacle for the messiah would
[29:36] you make me the virgin
[29:40] she didn't know it she was stuck in
[29:41] spiritual amnesia took a messenger from
[29:43] heaven to break her spiritual amnesia
[29:45] to who she really was she didn't have
[29:48] any concept of who she was
[29:50] until the angel came and spoke to her
[29:52] and when the angel spoke to her
[29:54] something in her was able to recognize
[29:56] what he said was true
[29:58] and to put herself in the scriptures
[30:05] that's the harder part friends i'll tell
[30:06] you right now the harder part
[30:08] is to be able to accept the the portion
[30:11] for you you can accept brother branham's
[30:13] portion you can accept there's a bride
[30:15] you can take generically everything he
[30:17] said about the bride in the end time and
[30:19] say that is the truth
[30:20] that the bride will be like that she'll
[30:22] have those characteristics
[30:24] she will be chosen predestination she's
[30:25] wonderful but when you bring it down to
[30:27] you personally
[30:28] people begin to trip them and like wow
[30:30] you know i i don't know i'm hoping i uh
[30:36] that's not the faith he's looking for
[30:38] that's not the right kind of faith well
[30:40] i just hope that i can make it i'm just
[30:42] trying really hard to be a believer
[30:44] mary wasn't trying to be a believer
[30:48] she believed
[30:51] see if we're trying to believe a
[30:53] believer if we're trying
[30:55] i'll just make this statement if we're
[30:56] trying to be a believer amen we are
[30:58] dealing with the intellectual realms
[31:02] and if you succeed in being that kind of
[31:04] believer you failed
[31:06] [Music]
[31:09] i'm trying to believe if you ever
[31:11] succeed in that trying to believe
[31:13] you have failed
[31:17] because you believed here he's not
[31:18] looking for that kind of belief
[31:20] he's looking for somebody who'll take it
[31:22] like mary will take it with no good
[31:24] explanation
[31:26] do you remember you recognize her
[31:28] question her question was
[31:30] a scientific she had a scientific
[31:32] question
[31:34] her scientific question was how shall i
[31:37] have a baby
[31:37] i haven't known a man well that's a good
[31:41] scientific question
[31:43] and we should give her a good answer
[31:47] so gabriel does well the holy ghost will
[31:50] overshadow you
[31:51] and the thing informed in you will be of
[31:53] the most high oh
[31:55] i get it amen
[31:58] do you understand it wasn't appealing to
[32:00] her into like it had nothing to do with
[32:02] reasoning
[32:03] it wasn't apologetics from the angel
[32:06] and he didn't have to go and prove it to
[32:08] her ten different ways
[32:10] all he had to do was speak the word what
[32:12] god's plan was for the day
[32:13] and she caught it amen by inspiration
[32:16] and said
[32:16] be it unto me according to that she
[32:18] didn't need time to think about it she
[32:20] didn't need research
[32:21] she didn't need amen
[32:26] she had something that would believe
[32:33] now i'm into the first sentence on this
[32:35] quote and it's a long one
[32:38] he says if we notice the anointed word
[32:42] of this day which you
[32:43] which you are apart by predestination
[32:46] you immediately
[32:46] knew when you heard that you knew right
[32:48] quick that you was an eagle
[32:51] you also realized that you wasn't a
[32:53] denominational chicken to begin with
[32:55] you know there's something wrong there
[32:56] there's something wrong that's right
[32:58] for you know that you were trapped into
[33:00] it at the beginning
[33:04] he the bridegroom took away your shame
[33:06] and put in the sea of forgetfulness by
[33:08] the washing
[33:09] of the water of the word and the blood
[33:11] of life that's what the bible said your
[33:13] first husband that you were
[33:14] married that you were married to the
[33:16] world the anointed bridegroom which
[33:18] foreordained you has washed you by the
[33:20] washing
[33:20] of the water by the church no that don't
[33:23] sound right does it no
[33:25] you might find that in the almanac but
[33:26] not in god's bible by the washing of the
[33:29] water by the word
[33:30] in the word see you are
[33:34] completely justified as though you never
[33:39] did it
[33:39] at the beginning now now
[33:43] don't make that brother branham's
[33:44] statement don't make that
[33:47] a quote brother chad's reading but i'm
[33:50] telling you there's an
[33:51] angel in the pulpit this morning
[33:52] speaking this to an individual virgin
[33:55] girl
[33:56] do you understand nothing is changing
[33:59] the scriptures we're in the same spot
[34:00] and i'm wondering is there a virgin girl
[34:03] out there you may not know your virgin
[34:04] amen because you've been part of all of
[34:06] this and all of this
[34:07] but down in your soul there's a seed
[34:09] that's never had
[34:10] a counterpart to germinate it
[34:14] it's never been germinated yet never
[34:15] been touched by anything because it can
[34:17] only be touched by the word
[34:21] and now you may not know you may not
[34:23] know that you're the fulfillment
[34:25] of isaiah you may not know that that
[34:27] you're the one amen but there's an angel
[34:29] in the pulpit this morning
[34:31] telling you reading a quote amen from a
[34:33] prophet messenger of the age
[34:35] that's saying you will stand complete
[34:38] completely justified as though you never
[34:41] did it
[34:42] at the beginning i'm telling you if you
[34:46] ask me to explain that i'm not going
[34:48] to explain that i can't explain that
[34:50] amen you have to receive it by faith
[34:53] i can't give you the chemistry or the
[34:55] mechanics amen to explain that but it's
[34:57] nothing but the truth
[35:00] so this is my message to the church now
[35:02] as we go off there just in a minute you
[35:04] are standing
[35:05] now listen to the qualification if
[35:08] you're standing on god's word
[35:11] and with god's word
[35:14] every amen every jot
[35:17] every tittle
[35:21] i want to explain something brother
[35:24] branham and
[35:25] this becomes clear later as we read
[35:27] other messages he's not
[35:29] talking about performance
[35:33] you stand with the word on the word and
[35:34] with the word every jot every tittle
[35:36] he's not saying that you never make a
[35:38] mistake
[35:40] he's not talking about your performance
[35:43] he's not talking
[35:44] about your acts he's talking about your
[35:46] faith
[35:49] that you believe all the word not the
[35:51] portion for luther not the portion of
[35:52] the wesley not the pentecostal portion
[35:54] but
[35:54] all the word because all the word has
[35:57] been restored
[36:00] if you're standing on god's word and
[36:01] with god's word every amen every jot
[36:03] every tittle where are you standing i'm
[36:05] trying to tell you
[36:06] pull away from the shucks and get out
[36:08] here in the wheat where you can get
[36:09] right before the sun
[36:10] i hear the coming of the conbine you're
[36:13] standing complete
[36:14] justified like you never did it in the
[36:17] first place
[36:19] hallelujah talk about a thanksgiving i
[36:21] feel real good i'm more thankful for
[36:23] that than anything i know of
[36:25] you are the pure virtuous
[36:28] sinless bride of the son of the living
[36:31] god
[36:33] now zechariah will say but you know you
[36:35] don't know what i've done in the past
[36:36] i've got all this baggage
[36:45] and i've heard i the reason i feel so
[36:48] strong about this is i've heard
[36:49] good people believers people that i love
[36:52] amen when you start talking about
[36:54] amen being pure virtuous sinless bride
[36:56] of jesus christ
[36:57] amen they immediately go to pass deeds
[37:02] but i did this and i did that and i
[37:05] still sometimes trip up in this and i
[37:07] still
[37:09] see like we said before you're climbing
[37:11] a ladder a greased ladder you're never
[37:13] going to get to the top of that ladder
[37:16] you're never remember mary heard the
[37:19] words amen of a prophet i mean the
[37:21] words of an angel messenger from god and
[37:23] when she heard those words
[37:24] she accepted it before she felt one
[37:27] change
[37:29] before she felt any different about it
[37:32] she
[37:33] accepted it because she recognized that
[37:35] what he said was true and she was part
[37:37] of the program
[37:43] you stand complete justified
[37:47] you are the pure virtuous sinless
[37:55] mary magdalene was delivered from how
[37:57] many devils
[37:59] seven devils what a waste of time for
[38:04] that woman to go around the rest of her
[38:05] life talking about having seven devils
[38:09] what a waste of a delivered life what a
[38:11] waste of the freedom that jesus christ
[38:13] gave her if all she can talk about is
[38:15] oh i got so many regrets i wish i
[38:16] wouldn't have had seven devils and blah
[38:18] blah blah blah blah
[38:19] and brother remember saying you were
[38:20] trapped into it you didn't mean to do it
[38:22] no fault of your own
[38:23] you come hybrid you come with spiritual
[38:25] amnesia you were trapped into that kind
[38:26] of life but now he's come
[38:28] with the word to free you from that kind
[38:30] of life amen
[38:31] now mary magdalene took her freedom and
[38:33] her freedom she wasn't bound down
[38:36] wringing her hands twiddling her thumb
[38:38] saying oh if you could just accept me
[38:39] after seven devils he
[38:40] already accepted her and delivered her
[38:42] from the seven devils
[38:44] he's already accepted you and delivered
[38:46] you from the seven denominational devils
[38:48] of the seven church ages
[38:51] [Music]
[38:52] not so we can say oh i hope i hope and
[38:54] maybe and if i'm good
[38:57] if you you realize if you don't catch
[39:00] this revelation you will
[39:01] never ever never make it
[39:06] because you will never overcome your own
[39:09] flesh
[39:12] you have to accept by faith and then let
[39:14] the word do the work that it's intended
[39:16] to do in your life
[39:17] the word will wash the word it's the
[39:20] washing of the water by the word
[39:22] you have to receive the word and let the
[39:24] word do the cleansing
[39:25] it's not your self-reformation that's
[39:27] going to do anything
[39:29] it's not deciding i'm no longer going to
[39:31] sin i'm no longer going to be a lazy
[39:33] christian i'm going to read my bible
[39:34] every day
[39:35] i'm going to listen to the message i'm
[39:36] going to church every day and somehow
[39:39] by that i will earn an entrance into
[39:41] this place where i can say
[39:42] amen that's me amen it was mary
[39:45] magdalene
[39:46] she was the chosen of god she was the
[39:49] one he came to
[39:50] it was the woman at the well he must
[39:52] needs go by samaria because there was a
[39:54] predestinated seed there
[39:56] that he was coming after when she was in
[39:58] her sin
[39:59] when she was actively wrong
[40:05] she he didn't tell her he didn't come to
[40:07] the well
[40:08] and say oh there's great treasures for
[40:10] you there's a position for you
[40:11] amen i've got wonderful things for you
[40:13] to do now
[40:15] if you go back and clean up your life
[40:17] and you straighten some things up
[40:21] then you're going to be part of my plan
[40:26] he told her she was part of the plan
[40:29] and the revelation that she was part of
[40:32] the plan
[40:34] amen unlocked in her a life that was
[40:36] already there
[40:39] see we we brother said we fail
[40:42] we fail to understand that we don't we
[40:45] don't
[40:46] convert people to christianity by
[40:47] governments not rules and regulations
[40:49] not not getting good enough to make it
[40:52] you really you'll never
[40:53] ever ever ever ever make it
[41:00] and with that mentality you'll never
[41:02] have the freedom
[41:04] because your willpower your choices your
[41:07] mental conceptions
[41:08] will never put us in the program of god
[41:11] it was the predestination that put us in
[41:13] the program of god
[41:15] and because we're in his program and
[41:17] he's got ordained works for us to do
[41:19] he's already had to make all the
[41:22] arrangements to make it possible for you
[41:23] to do what you're supposed to do
[41:26] and because he already made the
[41:27] arrangements all he needs for us to do
[41:30] listen mary didn't have to go get
[41:32] pregnant
[41:39] through no effort of her
[41:42] own the word
[41:45] did the work
[41:49] why she was predestinated before the
[41:52] foundation of the world to be the
[41:53] reciprocating part of that prophecy
[41:57] every mechanism was already in place all
[42:00] the power that was needed was there
[42:02] all she needed to do was recognize who
[42:05] she was
[42:06] and confess and admit it and immediately
[42:09] the program went to work in her life
[42:12] and she had enough confidence in what
[42:13] she heard to testify of it and confess
[42:16] it before she had one
[42:17] changed feeling
[42:20] god's looking for that kind of faith can
[42:22] you say i am that bride
[42:25] i've heard his voice i know it's me amen
[42:27] i've lived a horrible life
[42:29] i've done all kinds of wrong things i
[42:31] still don't live the way i want to live
[42:32] amen but that has nothing to do with it
[42:34] i'll never make it mary magdalene
[42:36] couldn't make it until he delivered her
[42:38] from the seven devils
[42:42] this woman at the well couldn't get free
[42:44] she was trapped into a condition and
[42:46] didn't understand it
[42:47] it took the coming of the seventh seal
[42:49] to unlock the mystery in her life and
[42:50] explain to her how she got into this
[42:52] condition
[42:54] and then she could run and say this is
[42:56] the messiah
[42:59] see it's so important to receive the
[43:02] words from a prophet
[43:04] by faith because it unlocks in us the
[43:07] potential that's in the seed
[43:10] and that potential was placed there to
[43:13] ensure
[43:14] that whatever god ordained for you to do
[43:16] you will do
[43:19] and it's there amen to be quickened to
[43:21] life
[43:22] amen but if we cannot get rid of
[43:25] intellectual
[43:26] concepts and willpower and trying to
[43:28] work it out and trying by
[43:30] self-reformation amen we're never going
[43:32] to get to the full potential that's in
[43:34] the seed
[43:35] because it's the water of the word and
[43:36] the light of the sun of this day that
[43:38] unlocks that potential and brings the
[43:40] seed into full manifestation
[43:43] so we've got to quit with human efforts
[43:46] getting to a place where
[43:47] well when i see this and when i see that
[43:50] i can testify
[43:52] when this happens and when that happens
[43:54] i'll have the confidence
[43:55] and maybe if i can see this change or if
[43:57] i can see that change
[43:58] no you don't have to see one change amen
[44:01] all you have to do is believe the word
[44:04] and the word will bring the change
[44:07] he says go back to our same quote you
[44:10] are the pure
[44:11] virtuous sinless bride of the son of the
[44:13] living god every man and woman that's
[44:15] born of the spirit of god and washed in
[44:17] the blood of jesus christ and believes
[44:18] every word of god
[44:20] stands as though you never sinned at the
[44:22] first place
[44:24] you are perfect the blood of jesus
[44:26] christ
[44:27] how can you if a man if i was supposed
[44:29] to die in the morning a man took my
[44:30] place
[44:31] i cannot die for that sin somebody took
[44:33] my place
[44:34] and jesus the word took my place he
[44:36] became me at a center that i might
[44:38] become him
[44:39] the word let me hold true to it not the
[44:42] church
[44:43] the word oh that spiritual union of
[44:46] christ in his church now
[44:47] when the flesh is becoming word and the
[44:50] word is becoming flesh
[44:51] manifested vindicated just what the
[44:54] bible said would happen in this day it's
[44:56] happening day by day
[44:57] why it's accumulating so fast out there
[44:59] in these deserts and things taking place
[45:01] that i couldn't even keep up with it
[45:03] we're near the coming of jesus to be
[45:05] united with his church where the word
[45:06] becomes the word
[45:09] call of the holy spirit searching the
[45:11] hearts you're standing completely
[45:14] you never sinned at the first place
[45:19] oh i tell you friends if you've come to
[45:21] that revelation and then you come to
[45:23] that place and say
[45:24] that's the truth he took my place amen
[45:26] this is
[45:27] this is what happened in hybridization
[45:29] amen but i've existed before
[45:31] hybridization
[45:34] i pray i was there before hybridization
[45:36] i was in the mind of god he had a plan
[45:38] for me he had a desire unto me
[45:40] before i fell into this condition and
[45:42] god's intention is to take me
[45:44] back to that place but i can't get there
[45:48] amen by trying to work through hybrid
[45:50] flash
[45:51] i must be released from all the
[45:53] consequences of being in hybrid flesh
[45:56] and if i'm released from all the
[45:58] consequences of coming the wrong way
[46:00] then i can be unlocked into the full
[46:02] potential that was there
[46:03] in his mind before the foundation of the
[46:05] world
[46:10] praise god it's like asking somebody
[46:14] to play basketball with 50 pound
[46:17] sandbags strapped all around them
[46:20] and i want you when you can beat
[46:23] this guy then you got it
[46:27] when you can score on him you got it
[46:30] and you're so handicapped you can't do
[46:32] it
[46:33] that's what it's like trying to be the
[46:36] bride without revelation
[46:39] you're so handicapped you'll never make
[46:41] it
[46:42] you're in this life so handicapped that
[46:44] there's no way you're ever going to
[46:46] attain to the place
[46:47] where you can finally feel comfortable
[46:49] saying i'm bright
[46:50] [Music]
[46:52] no you have to be comfortable in faith
[46:54] saying i'm bride
[46:56] before anything moves
[47:00] before you even learn how to dribble you
[47:02] got to say i won the game
[47:06] because that's what faith tells us
[47:10] amen he says
[47:13] you're standing completely you never sin
[47:15] at the first place
[47:16] god don't even know it's this in the sea
[47:18] of forgetfulness
[47:19] you never did it you were accused of it
[47:21] by the accuser but really from the
[47:23] beginning you were predestinated to be a
[47:25] son and daughter of god
[47:27] you're standing there washed and your
[47:29] old book of divorcement is put away and
[47:31] it's dead
[47:31] absolutely out of existence even in the
[47:34] mind
[47:35] of god
[47:41] you're the virtuous bride of christ
[47:43] washed in the blood of christ
[47:45] precious virtuous sinless son of god
[47:48] standing with a pure
[47:49] unadulterated bride word that he washed
[47:52] by the water of his own blood
[47:53] that became flesh and manifested that he
[47:55] might take you which were predestinated
[47:57] in the bosom of the father before the
[47:59] beginning
[48:00] the same as he was he was that great
[48:02] attribute of god called love
[48:05] whatever you are you are servants of god
[48:07] whatever god wants you to do
[48:08] where your place is god placed in the
[48:10] church some apostles prophets teachers
[48:12] pastors he placed that by virtue of his
[48:14] own predestination
[48:17] and you were that to begin with
[48:20] your first wedding was annulled it was
[48:23] you
[48:23] never done it in the first place your
[48:26] first wedding he's talking about your
[48:28] natural birth
[48:29] when you come married to the world that
[48:31] wedding is annulled
[48:33] it never happened
[48:38] amen you've never done it in the first
[48:40] place because there's only one thing
[48:42] could do it and that would be god come
[48:43] down himself and took your place in the
[48:45] form of the son of god jesus christ
[48:48] and washed you by the water of the
[48:49] washing of the water by the word
[48:51] the word not the denomination the word
[48:54] washed you
[48:55] but if you won't stand in the water of
[48:56] the word how you going to be washed
[48:58] you're still as spotted as eve was
[49:01] what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in
[49:04] what
[49:05] the word unbelief in god which is the
[49:07] word
[49:09] pure unadulterated now i want you to see
[49:12] where brother branham goes he's talking
[49:14] about you're sinless and never did in
[49:15] the first place
[49:16] see if god forgiven was pure
[49:17] unadulterated and it's almost like he
[49:20] injects a sentence and then he jumps
[49:22] right back to saying you're pure
[49:23] sin the spotless and that sentence he
[49:26] injects is the key to the whole
[49:27] understanding
[49:29] he said what is sin unbelief unbelief in
[49:32] what the word
[49:33] unbelief in god which is the word and
[49:36] you go right back to your sinless
[49:38] spotless
[49:41] this is the same man who after he had a
[49:43] born-again experience
[49:44] was a prophet of god preaching the
[49:46] gospel amen healing the sick
[49:48] would have his wife lied to a lawyer
[49:52] right have his wife lie to a lawyer and
[49:55] have to go make it right with a lawyer
[49:57] and have to go make it right with the
[49:59] man he's going to pray for his baby make
[50:00] it right with his wife and come and
[50:01] confess it to the church
[50:05] and brother branham brother venom didn't
[50:07] call it a mistake he called it
[50:08] a sin
[50:13] see but he never sinned
[50:19] he had a sinful act but he never sinned
[50:24] it was a sinful action friend you have
[50:27] sinful actions
[50:28] brother branham says amen a sinner has
[50:30] sin which is unbelief
[50:31] saints have sins which is
[50:35] sinful acts and conduct he said that's
[50:37] why the blood's for
[50:38] he said the blood keeps you clean from
[50:40] that he said you're not saved by the
[50:42] blood you're saved by faith
[50:44] you're justified by faith but the blood
[50:46] keeps you clean
[50:48] because you're still in hybrid flesh and
[50:50] you need something that's going to keep
[50:51] you clean
[50:52] even though you'll never ever ever be a
[50:55] sinner again
[50:56] brother branham had committed a sin a
[50:58] sinful act by telling his wife to lie to
[51:00] the lawyer
[51:01] he called it sin but he was not a sinner
[51:05] he was still a saint committing a wrong
[51:08] act
[51:08] amen because he did not disbelieve the
[51:11] word
[51:14] so brother branham is shedding some
[51:16] light in this statement
[51:17] what is sin sin is unbelief he's jumping
[51:20] right back in here and he's moving
[51:22] it away from the conversation of conduct
[51:26] he's taking it away from the
[51:27] conversation of conduct and bringing it
[51:30] right back to
[51:31] faith in the word of god because faith
[51:34] in the word of god
[51:35] will unlock the word of god which will
[51:37] bring the holy ghost
[51:38] amen the spirit of god which will
[51:40] transform your conduct
[51:45] your conduct will change your conduct
[51:47] will be corrected and even when you fall
[51:49] even when you fail
[51:50] amen the holy ghost is there to bring
[51:52] you to a quick conviction to bring you
[51:53] back to the word
[51:54] you'll never fail from disbelieving
[51:57] god's word
[51:57] you'll fail from not keeping his word
[52:04] so now this bride amen now
[52:07] brother branham is making a statement
[52:09] that hasn't been made luther didn't make
[52:11] a statement like this wesley didn't make
[52:12] a statement the pentecostal sure didn't
[52:14] make a statement like this
[52:17] but he's looking at you and saying if
[52:19] you're standing with the word
[52:20] if you're standing on the word and with
[52:22] the word every jot
[52:23] every tittle you realize amen no no
[52:26] other church age could do this
[52:29] they didn't have every jot they didn't
[52:30] have every tittle there was no prophet
[52:32] to open the seals
[52:33] the book was still a mystery the mystery
[52:35] of god was still wrapped up in a mystery
[52:37] but at the end he comes and ties
[52:38] together all the loose ends
[52:40] peels back to mystery and shows the
[52:42] whole plan of god so that now
[52:43] you can receive and believe every jot
[52:46] every tittle why
[52:48] every jot every tittle every word is
[52:51] jesus christ the seventh seal that's
[52:53] been unveiled in this day
[52:55] and i believe it all it's all him
[52:59] there was no other age that he could
[53:01] make this statement like this
[53:05] every other age was stuck in a portion
[53:07] of disbelief
[53:11] luther he would receive justification
[53:14] by faith in the word alone but he would
[53:17] still
[53:18] bring a persecution or uh encourage a
[53:21] persecution against the jews
[53:22] he would still have an unholy lifestyle
[53:26] you still swear and smoke and drink and
[53:28] all those other things
[53:29] wesley he could come to a sanctified
[53:31] lifestyle but he could never break free
[53:33] from some catholic tradition
[53:36] even the pentecostals could come and
[53:37] show the gifts of the spirit amen
[53:40] and move up higher but he could never
[53:42] break free from that trinitarian dogma
[53:47] but now we've come to a place at the
[53:50] opening of the word
[53:53] that the bride can finally break free
[53:57] from unbelief and believe the whole word
[54:00] of god
[54:02] like mary did mary believed the whole
[54:05] word of god
[54:06] now she goes up to elizabeth say
[54:07] elizabeth guess what i'm going to i'm
[54:09] going to conceive and i'm going to bring
[54:11] forth and elizabeth says how are you
[54:12] going to do it
[54:14] what kind of answers mary going to give
[54:16] how's that going to work
[54:17] tell me what happened i mean how i mean
[54:22] she can only say one thing the holy
[54:24] ghost will overshadow me
[54:27] she can't say anything else she doesn't
[54:29] know anything else
[54:30] all she knows is what that messenger
[54:32] said
[54:34] it was good enough for her amen she
[54:36] doesn't have to change it now
[54:38] and manipulate it around amen so that
[54:40] she can get elizabeth to believe it
[54:44] if it was good enough for mary it's got
[54:46] to be good enough for elizabeth too
[54:51] she's not trying to cut it and repackage
[54:54] it and piece it together
[54:55] and make it sound intellectual in a way
[54:57] that you know all the denominational
[54:59] believers do
[55:00] if they just sit and listen i mean if
[55:01] they just sit and listen they'll get it
[55:03] because i've got it in a nice package
[55:06] god don't want it in a nice package
[55:10] he don't want it in your tight little
[55:11] package
[55:13] with a clear explanation he said it the
[55:15] way he wanted it
[55:19] how is this going to be the holy ghost
[55:22] shall overshadow me
[55:24] oh that does something to me somebody
[55:26] else looks at him like
[55:27] i don't get it still like you didn't
[55:30] explain anything
[55:32] how's it going to be how do you know for
[55:34] sure
[55:35] oh i just know
[55:38] mary you're not making any sense mary
[55:41] you're not being reasonable
[55:43] let's reason this out let's talk about
[55:45] this now mary how
[55:46] okay you're going to bring forth a child
[55:48] okay knowing not a man
[55:50] how's it going to work what's the
[55:51] mechanism being used do you have to go
[55:53] to the drugstore and buy something do
[55:54] you have to take a pill how many
[55:56] to explain this to me i don't know he
[55:58] just said the holy ghost will overshadow
[55:59] you oh that's
[56:00] it
[56:05] and her friend's just like what's it
[56:08] don't you get it it's the holy ghost
[56:10] gonna do the work
[56:12] i don't get it how's that work it's the
[56:15] holy ghost
[56:16] god's going to do it see it's not to
[56:20] appeal to the mind
[56:21] it's to trigger a response from the
[56:23] recipient of the word
[56:25] and the recipient of the word has the
[56:26] missing piece and when they come
[56:28] together
[56:29] it clicks and they say that's it
[56:32] i believe it i see it i got it now
[56:36] person sitting next to them is still
[56:37] scratching their head
[56:41] praise god let's keep let's finish this
[56:44] quote
[56:44] sin what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief
[56:47] in what the word
[56:48] unbelief in god which is the word pure
[56:50] unadulterated oh hallelujah
[56:52] leaving soon for the skies amen standing
[56:55] ready
[56:55] think your garments washed by the water
[56:57] of the bleeding word
[56:59] the word became blood the word why he
[57:02] was the word made flesh
[57:04] and the word bled for you amen that's
[57:08] why when you accept the word
[57:09] you get the blood because he was the
[57:12] fullness
[57:13] of the godhead he was the lord made
[57:15] flesh and when the word made flesh that
[57:17] word was crucified in that word bled
[57:19] and that bleeding word atoned for your
[57:21] sins and now you cannot go back to that
[57:24] cross
[57:24] and gripe some blood off and cover
[57:26] yourself with the blood the only thing
[57:28] you can do is accept the word the same
[57:30] thing that bled for you
[57:31] and when you get a hold of the word for
[57:32] your day you're covered in the blood
[57:36] it's so simple friends people want to
[57:39] claim that i'm covered in the blood of
[57:41] jesus christ
[57:41] how explain that to me how did you get
[57:44] the blood on you
[57:46] what blood chemical blood the chemistry
[57:48] of the blood's not available today
[57:50] so how are you under the blood of jesus
[57:51] christ well by faith
[57:53] by faith and want by faith that there's
[57:55] a blood out there how do you get it how
[57:56] do you get a hold of it
[57:58] how because
[58:01] he was the word in the beginning was the
[58:02] word the word was with god the word was
[58:04] god the word was made in flesh and dwelt
[58:06] among us the word was crucified
[58:08] the word bled for me and that's the
[58:09] purchase price of rhyme redemption
[58:11] that's my atonement so how am i i can't
[58:13] go back 2
[58:14] 000 years and stand there and say i
[58:16] accept you lord jesus all i can do is
[58:18] accept
[58:18] jesus christ today and jesus christ
[58:20] today is the full
[58:22] measure of his word that's been unlocked
[58:25] and when i get a hold of that word amen
[58:27] i get the full
[58:29] benefit of that word and that life and
[58:31] the blood has a tone for me
[58:37] so simple you just have to believe him
[58:42] how do you how do you find jesus christ
[58:44] believe him in whatever form he comes in
[58:47] receive him don't reject him believe him

[58:59] pure unadulterated oh hallelujah leaving
[59:01] soon for the skies amen standing ready
[59:05] the word bled for you and you're washed
[59:07] in the bleeding word the word bleeding
[59:08] the life of god in the word and the word
[59:10] was bled for you that you might be
[59:12] washed from the filth of those
[59:13] prostitutes and be clean
[59:15] cleaned and sanctified by the washing of
[59:17] the water of the word
[59:18] and makes your mind and heart stayed on
[59:20] god and on his word
[59:26] see colossians 3
[59:29] 3 says for you are dead and your life is
[59:33] hid with christ and god
[59:35] you are dead and your life is in
[59:38] the bible says reckon yourself therefore
[59:40] dead
[59:42] unto sin and alive in christ jesus
[59:45] it says ii corinthians 5 17 therefore if
[59:48] any man be in christ
[59:50] he is a new creature old things are
[59:52] passed away behold
[59:53] all things are become new
[59:59] so by the transforming power
[1:00:03] of god through a new birth
[1:00:06] the old man is dead
[1:00:09] all things are become new
[1:00:12] how can now that which is dead
[1:00:15] hinder me from what god's called me to
[1:00:17] do now that i'm alive
[1:00:19] we have to reckon it dead reckon
[1:00:21] ourselves dead to those things
[1:00:24] prophet god said in christ is the
[1:00:25] mystery of god revealed you think i'm
[1:00:27] beside myself i'm not we've got the
[1:00:29] devil's answer
[1:00:31] not me that liveth but christ the word
[1:00:33] living in me
[1:00:34] i want to tell you something mary had
[1:00:37] the devil's answer
[1:00:41] what was the answer it's god
[1:00:45] mary didn't ask to be the virgin mary
[1:00:48] didn't
[1:00:49] choose to be the virgin mary didn't say
[1:00:53] uh i'd like to be that scripture right
[1:00:55] there oh god can i be that
[1:00:58] he chose it was his choosing
[1:01:02] she didn't even call for the timing it
[1:01:04] was his timing his choosing
[1:01:06] his placing it was his calling it was he
[1:01:09] sent the angel
[1:01:10] she didn't say oh god would you please
[1:01:11] send an angel to give me an answer amen
[1:01:13] god it was all him not her all him not
[1:01:16] her
[1:01:17] that's the devil's answer it's christ
[1:01:19] it's him
[1:01:20] it's him and me he's called me
[1:01:23] i didn't call him he called me
[1:01:27] you think i might sign myself i'm not
[1:01:28] we've got the devil's answer not me that
[1:01:30] liveth but christ the word living in me
[1:01:33] it's not my idea it's his power not my
[1:01:35] idea it's his word
[1:01:36] he promised it here it is he said it
[1:01:38] would be here and here it is
[1:01:40] we got his answer christ is risen has
[1:01:43] paid the price for our redemption
[1:01:45] while god in christ manifested he gave
[1:01:47] that flesh
[1:01:48] that and blood that in the blood might
[1:01:51] come the life
[1:01:52] and the flesh be redeemed that god in
[1:01:54] his redeemed flesh could manifest his
[1:01:57] word for the day
[1:01:58] as he did in that day he says woo
[1:02:01] glory
[1:02:04] then we stand justified in the presence
[1:02:07] of god as a drop of
[1:02:08] ink dropping into a tub full of bleach
[1:02:11] you will never find the stain of ink no
[1:02:13] more
[1:02:14] it went somewhere it'll never come back
[1:02:17] again and when man is
[1:02:18] truly redeemed that predestinated seed
[1:02:21] that sees it
[1:02:21] and accepts it his sins are demolished
[1:02:27] catch it the predestinated seed that
[1:02:30] sees it
[1:02:32] and accepts it
[1:02:36] it doesn't matter how many times brother
[1:02:37] branham says you're the sinless
[1:02:39] spotless virtuous if you're standing on
[1:02:42] the word and with the word every jot
[1:02:43] every title what am i trying to tell you
[1:02:46] you are justified just as ever you did
[1:02:47] it you're the sinless spotless
[1:02:50] that is for whoever can see it and
[1:02:53] accept it
[1:02:56] you can't say it doesn't do i'm telling
[1:02:58] you people amen to stuff and they don't
[1:03:00] even know what they're amen
[1:03:01] amen amen amen amen amen amen amen
[1:03:04] but never take it personally and say
[1:03:06] that's me that's me that's me that's me
[1:03:09] they're just saying that's the truth
[1:03:10] that's the truth that's the truth but if
[1:03:12] you can't
[1:03:13] take that and accept it it will do you
[1:03:15] no good
[1:03:16] you can bob your head you can amen you
[1:03:18] can shout out but if you're not able to
[1:03:20] take it by faith and accept it
[1:03:22] all the amenities in the world will
[1:03:23] produce nothing
[1:03:25] you must see it and you're acknowledging
[1:03:27] you see it with an amen
[1:03:29] but you also must accept it with a be it
[1:03:31] unto me
[1:03:32] [Music]
[1:03:35] amen the predestination you see that
[1:03:37] season accepts it his sins are
[1:03:39] demolished it's gone
[1:03:40] it's separated it's dropped into the ink
[1:03:42] of the blood of jesus christ and
[1:03:44] it's never to be remembered god forgets
[1:03:46] it
[1:03:47] and he stands as a son and daughter of
[1:03:49] god in the presence of god amen
[1:03:51] amen now we are the sons of god not we
[1:03:53] will be
[1:03:54] we are now we are redeemed
[1:03:58] listen now not future now
[1:04:05] let's look at philippians chapter 3
[1:04:06] together we'll lay in a couple
[1:04:08] scriptures
[1:04:09] several here and then we're going to
[1:04:10] move to the part that i really want to
[1:04:12] get to
[1:04:19] philippians 3 9.
[1:04:26] philippians 3 verse 9 and being found in
[1:04:28] him not having my
[1:04:29] own righteousness which is of the law
[1:04:32] but that which is through the faith of
[1:04:33] christ
[1:04:34] the righteousness which is of god by
[1:04:36] faith
[1:04:39] that i may know him
[1:04:42] and that i may know him and the power of
[1:04:44] his resurrection and the fellowship of
[1:04:46] his sufferings be
[1:04:47] being made conformable unto his death so
[1:04:50] he says
[1:04:50] now i'm being found in them not having
[1:04:52] my own righteousness it has nothing to
[1:04:54] do with my conduct my righteousness
[1:04:57] which is of the law which is my deeds my
[1:04:59] doing but that which is through the
[1:05:01] faith
[1:05:02] of christ not faith in christ faith
[1:05:05] of christ you are saved by grace through
[1:05:09] faith and that not
[1:05:10] of yourselves it is a gift of god it is
[1:05:13] the faith of christ
[1:05:16] the gift the righteousness which is of
[1:05:19] god
[1:05:20] by faith not your own righteousness it's
[1:05:22] a righteousness that is of god
[1:05:24] by faith it's a righteousness that's
[1:05:25] declared because you believe him
[1:05:31] let's turn over to romans 5.
[1:05:35] i just want to we we talked about this
[1:05:37] last time but i want to lay this so
[1:05:39] solidly in the scripture so you don't
[1:05:41] think that it's just
[1:05:42] somebody saying something
[1:05:47] uh romans chapter 5 verse 1 therefore
[1:05:49] being justified by faith
[1:05:51] we have peace with god through our lord
[1:05:53] jesus christ
[1:05:55] justified by faith not justified by
[1:05:59] conduct justified by faith
[1:06:02] amen and you realize that you have to
[1:06:06] believe
[1:06:07] the word you have to believe all the
[1:06:10] word
[1:06:11] and if you're going to be justified by
[1:06:13] faith faith and want
[1:06:14] faith in jesus christ faith in god faith
[1:06:16] in the word
[1:06:18] so if i'm going to be that's if that's
[1:06:19] my justification
[1:06:21] is be just be
[1:06:24] be real attentive if i'm going to be
[1:06:27] justified by
[1:06:28] faith and that is my justification
[1:06:34] what happens if i believe this part of
[1:06:36] jesus christ
[1:06:38] and i disregard this part of jesus
[1:06:40] christ
[1:06:42] now my justification is not on my good
[1:06:44] conduct but my justification is based
[1:06:47] off faith
[1:06:48] what i believe and abraham believed god
[1:06:52] and it was imputed unto him for
[1:06:54] righteousness
[1:06:55] and he didn't say it to him only that it
[1:06:56] was imputed but for our sakes also
[1:06:59] that if we believe it will be imputed
[1:07:00] unto us for righteousness
[1:07:02] so we are justified by faith so if i
[1:07:05] believe
[1:07:06] god believe and and they ask jesus how
[1:07:09] can we do the works of
[1:07:11] uh how can we do the works of god he
[1:07:12] said believe on him whom god has sent
[1:07:16] it's always believing in present tense
[1:07:18] god
[1:07:19] god is always coming and doing something
[1:07:21] and you have to believe it noah's day
[1:07:23] moses day abraham's day
[1:07:24] david day i mean it's always all through
[1:07:26] the bible is god doing something
[1:07:28] and the people either believe it or
[1:07:29] reject it that's the whole bible
[1:07:31] we've come here to the end of time and
[1:07:32] god did something through a malachi 4
[1:07:34] prophet ministry and you either receive
[1:07:36] it or reject it
[1:07:37] but it's god it's the word amen and now
[1:07:40] we say we're justified by
[1:07:42] faith i'm justified by faith because i
[1:07:43] believe jesus christ came and died on
[1:07:45] the cross
[1:07:45] but i do not believe he came in this
[1:07:48] ministry in the end time i do not
[1:07:49] believe in the son of man
[1:07:51] then where is your justification there
[1:07:54] is no justification there
[1:07:56] justification is by faith faith in the
[1:07:58] word and there's been a word there's a
[1:08:00] word that's presented today
[1:08:02] there's a word that's alive today
[1:08:10] god if it's going to work it's going to
[1:08:12] work
[1:08:13] we can't muddle it up and confuse it and
[1:08:16] say well if you just take one portion of
[1:08:17] the word and hold to that
[1:08:20] it doesn't matter if you blast from the
[1:08:22] holy ghost and call this other per this
[1:08:23] this
[1:08:24] other thing wrong false prophet false
[1:08:26] doctrine
[1:08:27] as long as you hold to this you're going
[1:08:29] to be justified your sins are washed
[1:08:31] away
[1:08:34] if that was the case all the pharisees
[1:08:37] scribes sadducees are saved
[1:08:40] because they were holding to parts of
[1:08:42] the word and giving their very lives for
[1:08:44] parts of the word
[1:08:45] but they could not receive the part of
[1:08:47] the word that was alive in their day
[1:08:49] and when they refused that part of the
[1:08:51] word that was alive in their day they
[1:08:52] were considered
[1:08:53] seed of the devil
[1:08:59] so the whole denominational ideas all
[1:09:01] you have to do is believe what jesus did
[1:09:02] 2000 years ago
[1:09:03] it is dead dung because if you have if
[1:09:07] you believe that
[1:09:08] you'll believe this it's the same jesus
[1:09:11] christ it's the same word it's the same
[1:09:13] it's the same word you can't just say
[1:09:16] like the pharisees did we believe in
[1:09:17] moses he said if you believed moses you
[1:09:19] would believe me
[1:09:20] if you believed jesus christ died on the
[1:09:22] cross you believe he came back for his
[1:09:24] bride to be united with her
[1:09:28] you know when i i'm i'm not saying the
[1:09:30] word is dead i'm not saying jesus christ
[1:09:32] didn't die i'm not saying
[1:09:33] that part of the word is dead or that
[1:09:34] person's no good but it's death if you
[1:09:37] hold to that and refuse this
[1:09:38] and call it something evil but we
[1:09:41] believe
[1:09:42] jesus died for us we believe that we're
[1:09:44] saved by faith in calvary
[1:09:48] but we're justified by what
[1:09:52] by believing by faith by believing in
[1:09:54] jesus christ the word
[1:09:57] so i regret saying i shouldn't have said
[1:09:59] that's dead done forgive me for that
[1:10:00] lord forgive me because that's the word
[1:10:03] there's nothing wrong with that when
[1:10:05] they say we believe most there's nothing
[1:10:06] wrong with that
[1:10:08] jesus christ died on calvary you must
[1:10:10] believe it
[1:10:12] you must believe it nothing in believing
[1:10:15] that is wrong
[1:10:18] so i shouldn't have ever said that that
[1:10:19] was wrong
[1:10:22] but i can't stay there
[1:10:25] and refuse jesus christ here
[1:10:29] and expect that that will be enough
[1:10:32] because it's the same word
[1:10:36] it's not a different word it's the same
[1:10:38] word
[1:10:39] the same word is alive today
[1:10:44] and i've got to get a hold of that word
[1:10:47] today
[1:10:48] if i can get a hold of that word today
[1:10:51] then
[1:10:52] everything in the word is alive to me
[1:10:55] and every part of the word is alive to
[1:10:57] me and every part of it is effectual
[1:11:00] in my life thank god for stopping me he
[1:11:05] checked me back on that statement
[1:11:07] praise god god is good friends
[1:11:10] he loves us he wants us to say things
[1:11:12] right
[1:11:16] amen and the rapture message brother ben
[1:11:20] says notice
[1:11:21] not only is the bride washed forgiven
[1:11:24] but she is justified
[1:11:27] did you ever try that word justify to
[1:11:28] see what it means
[1:11:32] now for instance if brother greene heard
[1:11:34] that i had been drinking
[1:11:36] i had been doing bad things and found
[1:11:38] out that i didn't do it then he come and
[1:11:40] said i forgive you brother branham you
[1:11:42] forgive me
[1:11:43] i never done it what you forgive me
[1:11:46] about
[1:11:46] see but if i'm guilty then i can be
[1:11:49] forgiven
[1:11:50] but i'm still not justified because i
[1:11:52] did it
[1:11:54] but the word justified is though you
[1:11:56] never
[1:11:57] done it at all justified
[1:12:01] and then the blood of jesus christ
[1:12:03] cleanses us so from sin until it's put
[1:12:04] in the book of god's forgiveness he's
[1:12:06] the only one can do it
[1:12:08] we can't we can't forgive we can forgive
[1:12:11] but not forget
[1:12:12] i could forgive you but i'll always
[1:12:13] remember you've done these evil things
[1:12:15] then you're not just you're forgiven but
[1:12:18] in the sight of god the bride is
[1:12:19] justified she
[1:12:20] never done it in the first place
[1:12:24] what first place the place i was before
[1:12:26] i got here
[1:12:27] [Music]
[1:12:28] i was trapped into this but in the sight
[1:12:30] of god the bride is justified she never
[1:12:32] done it in the first place amen
[1:12:34] standing there married to the virtuous
[1:12:36] son of god
[1:12:37] never sinned in the first place why she
[1:12:40] was four ordained she was trapped into
[1:12:42] this
[1:12:42] and now when she heard the truth and
[1:12:44] came forth the blood cleansed her
[1:12:47] do you hear that when she heard the
[1:12:50] truth and came forth the blood cleansed
[1:12:52] her
[1:12:52] and she stands there virtuous she no
[1:12:56] sin on her at all
[1:13:01] now i want to ask you when you when you
[1:13:03] say amen to that are you saying amen to
[1:13:05] the fact that the bride has no sin on
[1:13:07] her at all by the blood of jesus christ
[1:13:09] i can say amen to that that is nothing
[1:13:11] but the truth now the next question is
[1:13:13] is there any sin on you personally as
[1:13:17] the individual
[1:13:18] can you say that's true for me why
[1:13:20] because i've always done everything
[1:13:22] right and i always say everything right
[1:13:23] and i always get it right
[1:13:24] hey listen friends i just got it wrong a
[1:13:26] few minutes ago and the holy ghost
[1:13:28] checked me on it but that didn't change
[1:13:30] me
[1:13:30] i wasn't a sinner it didn't change my
[1:13:32] position
[1:13:33] amen your failures your faults your
[1:13:35] wrong attitudes your wrong speech
[1:13:36] it's not changing who you are you're a
[1:13:38] son and daughter of god amen you've
[1:13:40] accepted the word for your day
[1:13:42] you've been washed from all the sin and
[1:13:43] filthiness of the world
[1:13:46] and you stand virtuous sinless righteous
[1:13:48] the very righteousness of god is upon
[1:13:50] you
[1:13:53] personally not in the group
[1:13:58] because the whole group can say amen and
[1:14:00] only one in the group may actually have
[1:14:01] this kind of righteousness
[1:14:04] amen but it's being able to see it and
[1:14:07] accept it as truth
[1:14:11] mary could see it and accept it
[1:14:16] in james chapter 2 says and the
[1:14:18] scripture was fulfilled which said
[1:14:19] abraham believed god
[1:14:21] and it was imputed in him for
[1:14:22] righteousness and he was called the
[1:14:24] friend of god
[1:14:29] galatians 2 16 says knowing that a man
[1:14:32] is not justified
[1:14:34] by the works of the law but by the faith
[1:14:36] of jesus christ
[1:14:38] even we have believed in jesus christ
[1:14:41] that we might be justified by the faith
[1:14:43] of christ
[1:14:44] and not by the works of the law for by
[1:14:46] the works of the law shall no flesh
[1:14:48] be justified we are
[1:14:51] listen we're justified by faith
[1:14:54] by faith of jesus christ we might be
[1:14:58] justified by the faith
[1:15:00] of christ christ is the anointed word
[1:15:05] no flesh can be justified because no
[1:15:08] flesh can make it
[1:15:11] but you can be justified you
[1:15:14] the real you
[1:15:18] the real you the inside man
[1:15:21] can be justified by faith
[1:15:26] in the message jehovah jireh from 61
[1:15:28] says no man come to me except my father
[1:15:30] draws him all the father has given me
[1:15:32] will come to me what you scared about
[1:15:37] were you afraid we said well maybe i'm
[1:15:40] just not the right kind of a christian
[1:15:43] how can you come to god without god
[1:15:45] calling you first
[1:15:47] and all that he foreknew he was called
[1:15:49] is that right all that he called he is
[1:15:51] justified is that right
[1:15:52] all that he justified he hath already
[1:15:55] past
[1:15:56] tense glorified amen
[1:15:59] it's a finished work from the foundation
[1:16:01] of the world christians don't you see
[1:16:03] you're living under your privileges you
[1:16:05] don't know
[1:16:06] who you are
[1:16:09] this whole struggling amen struggling
[1:16:13] with past sins
[1:16:14] struggling with things that come down
[1:16:15] from mom and dad struggling with this
[1:16:17] and somehow
[1:16:18] questioning whether or not i'm a
[1:16:20] believer or whether or not it can be the
[1:16:21] bride because of this
[1:16:23] we've got to move past that and accept
[1:16:24] what he has done for us
[1:16:26] because what he has done for us will
[1:16:27] break us free from all of that
[1:16:35] brother brahm tells a story in the
[1:16:38] message doors and doors
[1:16:41] he talks about this man who in the civil
[1:16:44] war had run from his post of duty he was
[1:16:46] being arrested
[1:16:47] amen for for for leaving his company he
[1:16:50] was going to be shot
[1:16:51] and then a friend ran to abraham lincoln
[1:16:53] and got a pardon sign
[1:16:54] for him and he got it signed by the very
[1:16:56] president of the united states of
[1:16:58] america that this man was pardoned
[1:17:00] and he goes and he takes it to the man
[1:17:01] in jail and he says look i've got a
[1:17:03] pardon from you
[1:17:05] we all know the story brother brown
[1:17:06] tells it several places
[1:17:09] but i'm taking it from doors and doors
[1:17:10] and he says now he says that man says
[1:17:12] your party says
[1:17:13] quit mocking me you're just trying to
[1:17:14] make me feel better i'm going to die in
[1:17:16] the morning
[1:17:17] amen and he refuses his pardon
[1:17:20] and the next day they take him out and
[1:17:21] shoot him and it becomes a big court
[1:17:23] case
[1:17:23] and brother bam says now the ruling is
[1:17:25] this
[1:17:27] a pardon is a pardon only if it's
[1:17:30] received as a pardon
[1:17:37] see there's a reason god's done what
[1:17:41] he's done in this day
[1:17:43] so that he can release us from the
[1:17:45] bondage of hybridization
[1:17:47] they could release us from the bondage
[1:17:49] of failure and sin and
[1:17:50] all the things that had us bound he came
[1:17:52] to free us from all of that
[1:17:54] but you can only be free if you accept
[1:17:56] it
[1:17:59] if we can't accept the freedom that's
[1:18:00] been offered to us then we're always
[1:18:02] going to be going through the laundry
[1:18:04] list of conduct and deeds and actions
[1:18:06] and
[1:18:07] measuring sticks and plan programs and
[1:18:09] plans and whether or not
[1:18:10] i'm a bride or not based on how i did
[1:18:13] today
[1:18:15] and one day i feel like yeah i could be
[1:18:17] a believer i could be and the next day i
[1:18:18] feel like there's no way i could be
[1:18:21] see we got to move past that
[1:18:23] intellectual faith
[1:18:25] and say what did god call me who called
[1:18:28] me
[1:18:29] what do i believe and why do i believe
[1:18:41] brother said in the message spiritual
[1:18:42] amnesia
[1:18:44] said you that wants the holy spirit that
[1:18:47] wants to experience not an emotional
[1:18:48] excitement you want the holy ghost the
[1:18:50] life the germ of life inside you
[1:18:52] you want to get rid of that amnesia that
[1:18:54] makes you can't identify yourself
[1:18:57] you don't know where you stand you don't
[1:18:59] know what you are
[1:19:00] let's get rid of it right now
[1:19:04] there is a new birth here for you a real
[1:19:07] genuine
[1:19:08] new birth to lose the old man
[1:19:12] to be born again to be a new creature in
[1:19:14] christ will you still be stuck in
[1:19:15] hybridization
[1:19:16] absolutely but there's going to be
[1:19:18] somebody on the control tower
[1:19:20] that's grabbing this flesh and pointing
[1:19:21] back and saying buddy we're coming back
[1:19:23] here
[1:19:23] you're not getting away with that we're
[1:19:25] not going that direction anymore
[1:19:27] you're still being flesh but something
[1:19:28] will change on the inside that'll take
[1:19:30] control
[1:19:33] the man says the only saying i'm only
[1:19:35] saying this not to mix up doctrine but
[1:19:37] to straighten it out
[1:19:38] that we might get away from this fear
[1:19:40] and scare
[1:19:41] you don't know who you are you're not
[1:19:44] going to be but
[1:19:45] now you are the sons of god you always
[1:19:47] were the sons of god see
[1:19:49] and when god had in you in his thinking
[1:19:51] at the beginning
[1:19:52] you have to be some part of you your
[1:19:54] life that's in you now
[1:19:55] had to be with god before there well
[1:19:58] when he before he even become material
[1:20:00] here on earth before there was anything
[1:20:01] but god
[1:20:02] you were one of his attributes he knowed
[1:20:05] what your name would be
[1:20:06] he knowed the color of your hair would
[1:20:07] have he knowed all about you
[1:20:13] see before before
[1:20:20] jacob and esau
[1:20:24] did right or wrong one was loved and one
[1:20:26] was not
[1:20:28] and they weren't loved based off their
[1:20:30] character and conduct
[1:20:32] they weren't they weren't loved based
[1:20:34] off that they were loved based off
[1:20:36] predestination
[1:20:37] and election god's love for you is not
[1:20:40] based off how good you get it how nice
[1:20:42] you are
[1:20:43] god's love for you is based off his
[1:20:44] election his grace
[1:20:46] is his love extended to you and because
[1:20:49] he loves you
[1:20:50] he says i love you i died for you i died
[1:20:54] in your place
[1:20:54] and if you can accept me in the in the
[1:20:57] way that i come to you
[1:20:59] i will release you from all of that
[1:21:02] you have to say be it unto me according
[1:21:05] to your word
[1:21:08] brother bam says in the last recorded
[1:21:11] message he preaches
[1:21:13] communion 1965 he said now then one day
[1:21:16] as i was
[1:21:17] walked on that voice talked don't never
[1:21:19] smoke
[1:21:20] drink so forth and young fellows and all
[1:21:23] got older see there was something moving
[1:21:26] but yet all at once i looked up and i
[1:21:28] said
[1:21:29] i'm not the son of charles and ella
[1:21:31] branham
[1:21:32] there's something calling me like my
[1:21:34] little eagle i'm not a chicken
[1:21:36] there's something up here under
[1:21:37] somewhere oh great jehovah whoever you
[1:21:39] are
[1:21:39] open up i want to come home there's
[1:21:41] something in me calling
[1:21:43] there was a born again that little life
[1:21:45] was laying there that life of water was
[1:21:47] poured upon it
[1:21:48] then it began to grow now the old life
[1:21:50] was forgiven
[1:21:51] put in the sea of god's forgiveness to
[1:21:53] never be remembered again
[1:21:55] against me no more see now we stand
[1:21:57] justified
[1:21:58] as though he never has sinned in the
[1:22:00] presence of god
[1:22:04] i want to say this way
[1:22:10] whatever i was when i was born
[1:22:13] i'm not that anymore
[1:22:18] well you were chad lamb your birth
[1:22:19] certificate you're the son of this and
[1:22:22] the son of this mother and this father
[1:22:24] no i'm not
[1:22:26] that man is dead
[1:22:29] that life is gone those deeds are in the
[1:22:33] sea of forgiveness that unbelief
[1:22:35] has been separated from me and now what
[1:22:38] are you
[1:22:38] now i'm i'm the living
[1:22:42] son of god i'm a son you're a daughter
[1:22:45] we are children of the almighty god that
[1:22:47] seed was laying there the predestined
[1:22:49] eternal seed what god had in his mind
[1:22:51] before of me and
[1:22:52] through the new birth it was unlocked
[1:22:54] and it came to life and what i was i am
[1:22:56] not
[1:22:56] anymore i'm still in the same tabernacle
[1:22:59] same vocal cord
[1:23:00] same characteristics and features of my
[1:23:03] body but that
[1:23:04] man is dead and there's a newness of
[1:23:06] life and all that was attached to that
[1:23:08] life is gone
[1:23:09] and dead in the sea of god's
[1:23:10] forgetfulness and i've accepted my
[1:23:12] pardon
[1:23:13] and now i'm not that anymore what i am
[1:23:16] is something different
[1:23:22] be it unto me according to your word
[1:23:26] see god had to restore what was lost
[1:23:32] and to restore what was lost he had to
[1:23:34] bring back
[1:23:35] adam again do we understand
[1:23:39] adam and eve amen god had worked he had
[1:23:41] produced he had got everything the way
[1:23:43] he wanted he got adam and he out of adam
[1:23:45] he brought the woman
[1:23:46] put him in the garden of eden that fell
[1:23:48] and now god's been working to bring back
[1:23:50] that masterpiece to restore it back to
[1:23:52] that place
[1:23:54] and he first did it by getting the last
[1:23:56] adam jesus christ he got the man in
[1:23:58] place
[1:23:59] but now he's got to restore unto him his
[1:24:01] wife and he's been forming his wife back
[1:24:03] and bringing her back through seven
[1:24:04] church ages but he's got to bring her
[1:24:06] back
[1:24:07] and restore her back to what she was
[1:24:09] there
[1:24:10] and when he restores her back to why she
[1:24:12] was there she's got to go
[1:24:13] back to what she was before she
[1:24:16] disbelieved the word
[1:24:19] amen everything that fell fell
[1:24:22] because she disbelieved the word and so
[1:24:25] now there's been a constant
[1:24:27] cycle of disbelieving the word because
[1:24:29] the word hasn't come back in full
[1:24:31] measure
[1:24:31] but god was seeing fit to bring the word
[1:24:34] back
[1:24:34] in such a way that the bride could come
[1:24:36] back not in disbelief in the word but
[1:24:39] now
[1:24:39] in faith in the full word of god to
[1:24:41] restore back to an eaten condition
[1:24:44] already why did god bring his word
[1:24:48] to take us back to eden
[1:24:53] she fell by disbelief her
[1:24:56] conduct came after she disbelieved
[1:25:00] the adultery happened the fornication
[1:25:03] the adultery happened
[1:25:04] after she disbelieved her sin was
[1:25:06] disbelieving the word
[1:25:09] and her conduct followed her sin
[1:25:13] now we're going back he's got to restore
[1:25:17] eve now he's already restored the last
[1:25:19] atom now he's got to restore the last
[1:25:20] eve so now he's got to bring the eve
[1:25:22] back to a condition where she's no
[1:25:25] longer in a fallen condition
[1:25:28] i hope you understand what i'm saying
[1:25:30] i'm not talking about your flesh friends
[1:25:32] i'm talking about the real you on the
[1:25:33] inside
[1:25:34] he's got to bring the woman back to
[1:25:36] where she's no longer
[1:25:37] in a fallen condition she's restored
[1:25:41] back
[1:25:42] and if she can come back to full word in
[1:25:44] the word full
[1:25:46] full faith in the word of god
[1:25:52] let's look at it this way adam and eve
[1:25:55] no sin
[1:25:56] life that's what god's bringing back
[1:26:00] eve disbelieved the word there was a
[1:26:03] fall
[1:26:03] and then her conduct followed her
[1:26:05] unbelief
[1:26:07] are we clear on that and that cycle
[1:26:10] continued on
[1:26:10] but then god's been bringing it back and
[1:26:12] he first brings back the first man
[1:26:14] who will live all the word now he's got
[1:26:17] the
[1:26:17] by his spoken word by an angel messenger
[1:26:20] he's got to bring out the virgin
[1:26:24] and bring her back to a sinless
[1:26:26] condition
[1:26:28] by what justification by faith
[1:26:32] and if she can come back to what she was
[1:26:34] before she disbelieved the word
[1:26:36] by accepting all the word then her
[1:26:39] actions will follow
[1:26:43] do you understand she committed adultery
[1:26:47] because she disbelieved the word
[1:26:50] if we believe the word god's bringing us
[1:26:52] back to justification
[1:26:53] so that these bodies can start to follow
[1:26:55] and we start to live the word
[1:26:58] but if we don't recognize we've been
[1:27:00] washed away
[1:27:01] we'll never live the word will never be
[1:27:04] good enough
[1:27:05] we must first say i see it
[1:27:09] i see it he paid the price
[1:27:12] he paid it all there's nothing for me to
[1:27:15] pay
[1:27:15] all i have to do is receive it by faith
[1:27:18] and god's going to look down at you and
[1:27:19] say
[1:27:20] you're the sinless spotless
[1:27:24] virtuous bride of jesus christ
[1:27:27] and you can say amen amen
[1:27:31] how's it going to happen the word's
[1:27:33] going to come
[1:27:34] the holy ghost is going to come and
[1:27:35] unlock that seed that's inside of you
[1:27:37] amen and bring you back to the real
[1:27:39] realization of who you really are
[1:27:41] break your spiritual amnesia and show
[1:27:42] you that you were with him before
[1:27:44] now what's it going to do i don't know
[1:27:45] the mechanics i don't understand all i
[1:27:47] can say is
[1:27:48] it's the truth it's the truth it's the
[1:27:50] truth i'm not the son
[1:27:52] of this man and this woman i'm the son
[1:27:54] of god
[1:27:56] before i come to this earth i was the
[1:27:58] son of god god has a plan for me
[1:28:00] he's revealed it to me and now by me
[1:28:02] accepting that he's washed away
[1:28:03] everything that was against me so that i
[1:28:07] can be
[1:28:08] what he's called me to be no more
[1:28:11] armenianism
[1:28:12] no more climbing the ladder no more
[1:28:14] trying to get it right
[1:28:15] but he got it right for me and he's
[1:28:17] called me to a higher place
[1:28:18] so that he can work through me
[1:28:22] and i just want to say it's the truth
[1:28:29] you are the sinless
[1:28:34] virtuous sinless
[1:28:38] spotless bride
[1:28:41] of jesus christ
[1:28:45] don't say amen because i said it don't
[1:28:48] say amen because i read it from the
[1:28:49] message
[1:28:51] say amen because you know it's the truth
[1:28:54] i'm not looking in the mirror i'm not
[1:28:56] looking at my conduct but i'm looking at
[1:28:58] the word and the word says i'm justified
[1:29:00] by faith
[1:29:00] the whole words come back and i believe
[1:29:02] it all
[1:29:03] [Music]
[1:29:05] and that faith in that word has put me
[1:29:07] back in that
[1:29:08] eden-like condition waiting for my body
[1:29:11] to follow where i'm already at
[1:29:16] as we go off the air
[1:29:22] you know what message i'm quoting from
[1:29:24] as we go off the air i'd like to just
[1:29:26] say this
[1:29:28] if you're standing with god's word on
[1:29:30] god's word and with god's word every jot
[1:29:32] every tittle every line
[1:29:35] then there's nothing against you there's
[1:29:38] not a mark against you you're the
[1:29:39] sinless spotless
[1:29:41] virtuous bride of jesus christ no fear
[1:29:44] no worries no chance of not making it
[1:29:46] no chance of not being good enough no
[1:29:48] fear of not measuring up
[1:29:49] no hoping that i'll be there someday but
[1:29:52] if you're there you've accepted this
[1:29:53] word you've caught it and he's called
[1:29:55] you
[1:29:55] he's awakened that seed on the inside
[1:29:57] you were with him before the foundation
[1:29:59] world there's nothing to keep you from
[1:30:00] going back there
[1:30:01] you've already come back to that
[1:30:03] condition he saw you in before
[1:30:08] that faith will continue to grow until
[1:30:10] the outside
[1:30:12] will catch up with the inside
[1:30:15] because it went the opposite way and
[1:30:17] eden the inside
[1:30:18] disbelieved the outside caught up now
[1:30:21] the inside believes and moves back to
[1:30:23] that condition and the outside is going
[1:30:25] to catch up
[1:30:26] let's all stand i want to have the faith
[1:30:30] of mary
[1:30:32] before i feel one thing musicians if you
[1:30:35] come
[1:30:36] before i feel one thing before before i
[1:30:39] i feel one sense of oh i feel good i
[1:30:43] feel like i'm the bride i feel like
[1:30:45] i got the world licked i feel like i can
[1:30:47] live the word before i feel one thing
[1:30:49] i want to say it's the truth god has
[1:30:52] washed away
[1:30:53] all of my sins my hybrid condition is
[1:30:55] answered for and i'm free
[1:30:57] completely free from all of that life
[1:31:01] and when god looks at me he looks at a
[1:31:04] restored bride that is restored to his
[1:31:06] son
[1:31:07] the bride and groom back together again
[1:31:10] in an eden-like condition
[1:31:13] and i say that's nothing but the truth
[1:31:18] what gave mary magdalene the ability
[1:31:23] to live the life he first
[1:31:26] freed her from her old life
[1:31:30] gave the woman at the well the ability
[1:31:31] to run in and face all of those men
[1:31:33] and begin to preach the gospel to them
[1:31:37] first he took care of her old life
[1:31:43] what's going to give this bride the
[1:31:44] ability to be all that he said she's
[1:31:46] going to be
[1:31:48] because he has proven he's taking care
[1:31:50] of the old life
[1:31:52] to unlock the potential that's in the
[1:31:56] sea let's bow our heads and pray
[1:31:58] lord jesus we thank you father
[1:32:02] god i don't think we can fully grasp
[1:32:05] all that you're trying to tell us i know
[1:32:08] lord that i can't
[1:32:10] i can't explain it lord i can't get it
[1:32:13] out the way it should come
[1:32:15] but god if we could only see how free we
[1:32:17] really are
[1:32:19] if we could only see how perfect you see
[1:32:21] us
[1:32:22] if we could only through a moment lord
[1:32:25] see ourselves the way you see us
[1:32:28] then all the struggles would be over
[1:32:29] lord all the fear would vanish away
[1:32:33] all the little manipulations of the
[1:32:35] enemy it would just dissolve
[1:32:38] god that's what you're trying to get us
[1:32:39] to see in this hour
[1:32:41] who we really are god let your word
[1:32:44] strip away our amnesia
[1:32:46] so that we can come to the reality that

[1:34:29] by the baptism of the holy ghost and let
[1:34:30] that seed life live
[1:34:32] and bring them back to that condition
