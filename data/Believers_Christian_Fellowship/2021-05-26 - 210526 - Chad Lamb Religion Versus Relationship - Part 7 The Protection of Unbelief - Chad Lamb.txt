[Music] [Applause] [Music] i will [Music] that's what we desire more than anything this is leadership amen it's good to be with you this evening while we're standing let's take our bibles let's just look to the word let's go to revelation chapter 3. before we read the scripture i'd like to greet brother david and sister diane deanhart god bless you guys it's good to have you with us amen that's been a little while but they've got a pool that keeps bringing them back here and that's their family and we get to benefit from that so they're happy to have them here for a grandson's graduation and also to celebrate their 50th wednesday anniversary congratulations god bless you man amen and while they're in town i've asked brother david if he'd minister for us on sunday so he graciously said yes he's planning on ministering so i'm sure he'll appreciate your prayers and greater than that i'll appreciate your pool on sunday amen so we look forward to that and then also i wanted to let everybody know that according to our governor this will be the last wednesday under a mass mandate praise god they said june 2nd which is next monday should end they're going to release us from all mandates all health orders all of that unless they pull the switcheroo i hope not it's hard to trust the political atmosphere but that's what everything i have read is said it's a consistent theme in consistent statements so i believe next wednesday we'll be smiling at one another without mask those who have been vaccinated have already been released they've been freed as of the 15th so amen they're already free they know what it feels like but praise god our turn's coming we just thank god for his faithfulness through it all i mean the words never diminished one iota no matter what happens what comes what goes the word keeps moving just right along amen and bringing us higher and higher so we're thankful for that i'd like to continue on with this series on religion versus relationship i believe this is part seven i'd like for a subtitle to take the protection of unbelief the protection of unbelief and i've got so many thoughts and so many things on my heart that i just can't put it all together so i'm trusting god to put all the pieces together because there's no way a man could be capable of that but let's just look at revelations chapter 3 together and we'll read from verse 14. and unto the angel of the church of the laodicean's right these things sayeth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that were cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buying me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes said that thou mayest see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him will sup with him and he with me man let's just bow our heads and ask the lord's blessing lord jesus we thank you for the privilege of being gathered here tonight for god you've been faithful to bring us once again by your grace and your mercy and our lives and we've come lord to worship you in spirit and truth for you have called us lord we could not come unless you called and that was your mercy and grace expressed to us now lord we ask that you would take preeminence among us and speak your word to us lord the word that we have need of for this day may lord we have the eye salve and the white raiment and the gold tried by fire may we enjoy it lawn we ask for your blessings over every part of this service and everything that'll be said take this vessel under your control in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated we look here and at the laodicean church age which we know as the last church age which is the one that the world is currently under and we find that the condition that jesus finds the church in is the same condition he finds the men when he comes the first time when he came he found a church that thought they were right that thought they loved god thought they worshipped god but when god showed up to fulfill the word that he promised to fulfill amen it was exposing the unbelief that was laying in the church amen and they did not believe the word although they confess that they believe the word although they thought they believed the word because when the word came into manifestation they rejected that word proving that they were an unbeliever is that true they didn't know it they would have never confessed it amen but their encounter with the manifested word for their day amen proved the condition that they were in and so now at the end of time in the laodicean church age and then we find the same scenario he comes amen and finds a church that in verse 17 he says because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing this is the laodicean condition of the laodicean church they didn't know they had a need they thought they were rich and increased with goods it had need of nothing so the church at the end time believes they're fine their condition is fine and all is well more than fine they're rich and increased with goods and they they have no need and they're very much in the same condition amen as the church was in jerusalem in that day and so now we find that jesus is on the outside of the church knocking they put him out in this age because they didn't need him because they were rich and increased with goods and had need of nothing but he says and here in verse 17 and knoweth not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked what is it that had so blinded them to their real condition when when jesus testifies to them what their condition actually is is that they they are actually wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked amen what was it that that had veiled them amen it was the veil of religion that had veiled their eyes to where they could not see their condition amen amen and so god had a veil in the beginning that would veil the eyes of their children that they would not see amen their nakedness they had a veil of innocency but that avail of innocy was taken away and they came under a lust veil and now as satan had perfected amen his eden when he comes to the perfection of his eden he has the church under a religious veil and they are veiled to their nakedness again only it's not a holy veil it's an unholy veil and this is the work of religion and this is the the work of satan this is what he's been trying to produce amen he's trying to build his own eden in god's see satan is always replicating and perverting replicating and perverting he's copying god and god and his satan he has them naked but under a veil of innocency but in satan's eden he has them once again naked but still veiled to their nakedness so that they would not need christ when christ came because now they have need of nothing because they're veiled to their spiritual condition this is the height of religion this is the pinnacle of religion when they've come to a place when they're so wretched and so miserable and so poor and so naked but have no idea because of the religious veil and they feel like all as well and so that was satan's goal that is satan's agenda and we find in this in this age jesus is on the outside of the church because they didn't need him so they didn't welcome him amen and they cast him out they thrust him out of their midst and now those who realize that they have a need must go beyond the camp amen must leave the realm of religion must leave the realm of the church amen it must be united with him outside the camp beyond the walls of religion amen because within the walls of religion they're held captive amen and he that the wall of the religion was the barrier that kept him out so the walled city of denominationalism of religion of church amen builds a wall amen just like a nimrod built a city and built a tower they built a city and built a tower supposedly for their protection for their unification amen to protect them from the judgments of god to protect them from being scattered so they would not be weak but so they would remain strong but the but the city and the tower amen that was supposed to liberate them and protect them was the very thing that ensnared them and trapped them so god came down and interrupted the work so that his children could go free and out of that he pulled an abraham and so now we find that the same thing in this day but because jesus has come in this day and been rejected and been thrust out of the church now he's calling us to leave the system to leave the walled cities to leave the denominations to be joined to him outside the city so to leave religion amen and and and you know many of us we've had to leave the baptist and some of the catholics and some pentecostals and some of this to come to the message amen but too many times we brought baptist along we brought pentecostal along amen but he wants us to come out completely come out of that thing be completely separated from that and go beyond the camp of religion and be united with him outside the city and so we've got to leave it all behind mother bram said everything that was in that previous age had to be burnt totally burnt amen nothing left over amen all that was there had to be completely burnt because it was good for that age but it could not carry over to this age there's a lamb for this day and that lamb for this day contains everything that was right in that day is the lamb for this day but we can't have a leftover lamb we can't have a reheated religion a leftover we can't bring any leftovers into this it's got to be the lamb for our day and the lamb for our day contains everything that the lamb contained in previous ages praise be to god so we need to let it be burnt by fire by the holy fire of god burn it all up and take the lamb that's here for today benham said the message god hiding himself in simplicity he said in the beginning when man sinned it showed the nature of man he's always trying to hide from god and make himself a way that he can feel justified a religion that's been a religion means a covering so he tried to make his own religion i've read that i think every time we've preached on this series but it's so important that a man has made his own religion so that he can feel justified man is under the veil of denominationalism and religion because he wants to be under the veil because he doesn't want to see his own condition because if he'd actually see his own condition then he would need christ and if he would need christ he would have to go beyond the camp to find him in this day because he cannot be found in the realm of religion you have to go beyond the camp to find him in this day and to go on beyond the camp means to live leave every security that you've ever held on to everything that you've ever thought to be right or true amen you've got to allow that to be burnt amen to unite with him and when unite with him he'll tell you what is right and what is true and so man would rather stay under the veil because of the false security that it provides man would rather stay in his religion because it's it's risky business to go beyond the camp because if he was rejected and cast out and you leave to go to him guess what you will also be whatever he is you are you're identified with him in every way if you go beyond the camp and leave all religion behind and unite to the one that's been rejected by the camp amen then you will also take on the same rejection that he's had and jesus was not looking amen is not looking for any false security his security comes from his position from who he is his identification as the word amen and it takes in order to go beyond the camp and be united with him it takes a certain something on the inside amen that has the same attributes amen we may not recognize it at first we may not understand what's going on in us amen but when as god the father is drawing us what he's doing is he's drawing a life that's on the inside of us he's cooing he's wooing he's speaking to a life a counterpart a part of himself and there's something in there amen that's a faith that's laying there dormant waiting to come awake but as he begins to brood over it it begins to pull amen and it begins to pull us beyond everything we've ever understood beyond everything that brought security beyond everything that was safe to us in the past and begins moving us into dangerous territory amen see it's only dangerous to the human mind it's dangerous to our perception it's dangerous to our levels of comfort amen but it's the only safe place to be it's going beyond the camp to unite with him and man would rather stay behind the veil then lose his security for what he doesn't yet understand many of us have known what it's like to lose our security for what we don't yet understand amen to follow him you walk a walk of faith now after he said this and god hiding himself in simplicity he says man make himself a way that he can feel justified a religion has been a religion means a covering so he tried to make his own religion but god made his decision on how that he would meet man that was upon the shed blood and that's the only way no matter how much we try any other way that's the only place that god will meet man for fellowship is under the shed blood that's why there had to come a fresh kill of the word in this day because god's path is always the path of the blood and there always must be a blood atonement there has to be a fountain open somewhere amen where this blood is flowing where the life of the blood can come to the believer and so there had to be a fresh kill of the word in our day so that we could unite with the sacrificial lamb amen and so we could get to the blood [Music] brother bam said they believe the denominations believe they're getting people to the blood amen but they reject the very plan to get to the blood the word amen the word was the plan so god in this day had a fresh kill of the word so that we could feast on a bleeding bloody word amen so that there's still blood in this word amen so that it's fresh amen there's still an atonement that comes with this word in this day amen it wasn't what bled out the previous day but it's a bleeding word for this day because under the bleeding word for this day there's a path to the atonement amen and the atonement will bring us reconciliation back to the father and bring us back into relationship and we cannot come that way without the fresh kill of the word in this day and that's why god provided it for us in this day praise be to god let's turn to the gospel of john john chapter 11. i've given you fair warning i have no idea how this is going to work but i'm trusting him amen [Music] and then just too many things too many pieces too much bubbling up to be able to understand so i'm not trying to understand amen trying just to relax john chapter 11 verse 45. then many of the jews which came to mary this is mary after the raising of lazarus as mary lazarus sister and it's seen the things which jesus did believed on him but some of them went their way to the pharisees and told them what things jesus had done then gathered the chief priests and the pharisees a counsel and said what do we for this man do with many miracles if we let him thus alone all men will believe on him and the romans shall come and take away both our place and nation and one of them named caiaphas being the high priest that same year said and to said unto them you know nothing at all nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and the whole nation perished not and this spaking not of himself but being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus should die for that nation and not for that nation only but that also he should gather together in one the children of god that were scattered abroad then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death they chose to kill the word because who was jesus christ he was the word made manifest in their day he was the fullness of the word of god everything they claimed to believe he was every book that they read amen uh the the pentateuch all the writings of moses the psalms amen even the kings and the chronicles amen all through the prophets everything that they read he was the embodiment of everything that their religion was based on and the word was standing before them and they felt threatened by the word the manifested word the present day word the fullness of the word became a threat to them until they get to the place where they said now listen all will follow after him we're going to have an upset of the system and the romans will come who cares about the romans see the only ones who care about the romans are the ones who've gotten comfortable in the roman system and under the roman system they had a place in a nation amen they had authority they had protection amen they had an enforcing agent they had they may have had scuffles with the authorities they may have had tissues and tats but their conduct here proves that they had gotten comfortable under the roman system and under the roman system they had a place and a nation amen and they did not want this present day truth to upset their position and their place in the roman system so they were willing to crucify the word to keep their place to keep their religion to stay under the roman system so jesus christ became a threat to the spiritual leaders in that day and you say how can this be it's because they started adapting their own ideas and their own concepts and they long ago had left their love for the word but they loved their religion amen they loved their position they loved the security that came from all of us you know being united we're all jews amen we're all descendants of abraham we've got the law amen we're the oracles of god and they started to appreciate their position and they started to appreciate the security that came from that and they stopped loving god they stopped loving god and started loving the privileges that came from the religion they started loving the system of worship they started loving the system of rules and conducts and hierarchies and they started to love the system and they started to worship the system and they stopped worshiping god now who instituted their system god who instituted their feast days who who instituted their new moons and who who who had their daily oblations put in order who who set up the tabernacle whose did it god did it all amen god did it as a way for man to approach unto him and for man to know him amen god wanted them to know what all the vessels were amen he wanted to know what the what the three the the motion of three steps into the inner chamber was from the outer from outside the court to the outer court to the inner court to the holy of holies he wanted all of this he wanted the seven feast of the lord to be ingrained in them so that he could come along later amen and tell them what the tutor was trying to show them and so god wanted the word and god wanted the law amen god wanted the system that was set up he wanted this to be a way that he would reveal himself to his children and they could grow in the revelation of that word amen but the problem was they stopped seeking god and got comfortable with the system and now god was not their savior the system was their savior amen god was not the forgiver of sins their actions became the power that forgave them think on that for a minute were they doing wrong they were they were doing the right actions they were giving the right sacrifice they were doing it according to the word amen but the problem was their hearts desire changed their focus changed they meant their attitude and approach towards towards god's system had changed and they made it into something god didn't intend for it to be and now their ability to bring a lamb became the means of their salvation instead of a heavenly father that would look down on their obedience and forgive them and so now their forgiveness and their atonement and their their reconciliation to god all became based on their ability to produce what the system said like i said sunday i feel like i'm tiptoeing on the edge of a razor blade because these are the things god instituted they're right they're holy they're clean and they're good but when man takes the wrong approach toward these things amen his approach is wicked his approach is evil not the thing that god instituted never amen is not wicked amen but man's approach becomes wicked and so now they weren't looking to a heavenly father anymore for forgiveness they were looking to the system for forgiveness the approach the system of worship and they begin to alter it and doctor and add to it and take away they begin to to manipulate this system amen based off their own wants or their own needs or however they would begin to manipulate this because their heart was no longer in it for heavenly father their heart was now in the system for their own benefit and that where they begin to fall away in error because it was no longer a reproach into an approach into a heavenly loving father but now it was all about me being justified me being forgiven and me being right and me being protected and me getting blessings and then they begin to take the wrong approach towards these things so much so that they quit worshiping god and started worshiping the system say brother chad i'm telling you it's the truth because when god came to them according to the word they didn't want him but they were willing to take the roman system by both hands to keep the religion to push away their god when jesus christ came on the scene amen that was their god made flesh standing there the word that he promised it was all there amen and they acted like they wanted the messiah but when the messiah come they didn't want the messiah because the messiah was train wrecking their system he was ripping apart amen their their false security he was ripping apart amen their false notions and ideas amen their false affections he was exposing amen he was he was making their fig leaves nakedness and as he was doing that amen they did not want to lose the system so they were willing to identify with rome and even plead with rome and work with rome to get rid of god but they wanted to stay religious they wanted to keep moses and the law and the prophets and the torah and the books and the scrolls and the temple and the sacrifices and the burning of incense and the high priest they wanted all the form without god i tell you nothing's that's changed what man wants because god to come to god first you have to come to god and be made miserable poor blind wretched you have to you have to have an expose of your condition amen so that you realize all my religion has failed man all that all that i tried to do has failed me all that i my ideas are all carnal my desires are all selfish amen everything i wanted it's been false amen everything i thought the truth i find that was based on selfishness and now what i thought amen was was beauty and clothing and riches and have need of nothing amen i come to the message and the messenger of the app the word of god through the messenger of the hour begins to make all my religion nakedness amen and i find out i'm wretched and i'm miserable and i'm poor and i need him more than i've ever needed anything in my life [Applause] [Music] but because man wants security amen when the word of god the voice of this day the voice of god that come walking in the evening time in the garden when he heard that voice he hid himself from god because he realized he was naked and he was covered in his own religion but he knew if that voice and that presence he was naked and because he feared because he was naked he hid from god and man is doing the same thing today and when that voice came in the evening time walking in the garden it was the voice of god showing that the presence of god was here amen and what he was doing he was making all religion fig leafs and there was a few who would realize that they're wretched [Music] like a tax collector or a fisherman or a prostitute or a samaritan with too many husbands it wasn't hard for them to realize that they were wretched and miserable and naked and needy and they ran to him because he was offering them cleansing his clothing isaf white raiment and gold amen but those who already had everything they needed for security you understand those who had everything they needed caiaphas had everything he needed to feel secure he was in the right lineage he was in the right family he was in the in the right nation he had the right position amen he had a position he had a nation he was secure and because he didn't recognize his need amen he didn't need god but he wanted his form of religion because this form of religion is what gave him his security let's go to john 19. praise god that's why i titled this protector of unbelief because religion gives itself as the premise of the upholder of truth all religions they come under the false notion that we are the upholders of truth but the reality is every religion is the protector of the unbeliever that's the reality because because when nimrod amen said let us not be scattered about but let us unify ourselves and build a city and a tower amen that tower would be for protection and man in case god would judge with the flood again that's what the prophet of god told us and so now let us unify ourselves see if anybody there believed god because god said i will set a token in the sky and that token will be the rainbow and that rainbow will be a covenant between me and all that has breath upon the earth and between me and the earth that i will never destroy the earth with a flood again is that his word so then if nebuchadnezzar now is or not nebuchadnezzar but nimrod now is going to build a tower amen where brother branham said amen if god will bring a flood we can run up here sing with the angels amen when the flood passes we can come back down and live any way we want amen the only people who would align themselves with nimrod's religion are the unbelievers who do not believe the word of god because god said he will not destroy the earth with a flood again and he also commanded them to multiply and replenish the earth and he scattered them out to multiply and replenish but nimrod is saying let us not be weak in the scattering but let us unify ourselves amen and anybody who believed the word of god would not have come together for his city for his unified empire so now nimrod is building a religion that will protect the unbeliever so the devil is so deceptive that he sells religion as the upholder of truth when in fact he's the guardian of unbelief he is the shepherd and protector of the unbelievers and he uses the walled cities of religion to harbor and protect the unbelievers how so have you ever talked to somebody about water baptism in jesus name and showed them the scriptures and they believed you and then they went and talked to their pastor and then they came back to you the next week and said i don't believe that that's false my pastor said what is that church amen that church is a harbor of unbelievers amen they're not there to uphold church they are there amen to barricade and block the people from getting to truth and they are there to harbor unbelievers amen because when you begin to teach water baptism in jesus name to somebody amen and they catch it intellectually because brother branham said you don't even need a revelation for that they catch it intellectually they run to the pastor and the pastor talks them out of it intellectually it shows there was no revelation in the heart and when they come back to you and they've been talked out of it intellectually now the religion has now protected the unbeliever from god and how many times has that happened but that person goes to that church and is part of that religious order because that religion is an upholder of truth but their actions prove that they're a barrier to truth and a harbourer of unbelief romans 19 verse 10 then saith pilate unto him this is jesus trial this is proud unto him speak thou not unto me knowest thou not that i have power to crucify thee and i have power to release thee jesus answered thou couldest have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin and from henceforth pilate sought to release him but the jews cried out saying if thou let this man go thou art not caesar's friend whosoever make himself a king speaketh against caesar when pilate therefore heard the saying he brought jesus forth and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement but in the hebrew gabatha and it was the preparation of the passover in about the sixth hour and he saith unto the jews behold your king but they cried away with him away with him crucify him pilate saith unto them shall i crucify your king the chief priest answered we have no king but caesar we're at the most religious place jerusalem who the most religious leaders part of what was the correct church to that day is that right where else was god working he was working through the jews he was working through jerusalem amen until jesus come and when they crucified him they put him that word into full effect so that jerusalem was the order jerusalem the most holy place the correct church the high priest the chief priests they would get so entrenched in their system and become so antagonistic against the living word that they would cry out we have no king but caesar absolutely denying the word absolutely denying their father and they would choose listen they would choose the system over the living word they would ch choose the roman system over the living word because the living word was exposing their need and they wanted to cover their need because religion is a covering a way for men to hide from god and jesus was ripping the veil of the covering to get his children to come out of theirs to see their need so that they would go beyond the camp and be united to him now there was a unification amen in israel in this day of two sects two factions within the jewish church and they were sadducees and and pharisees and the pharisees were your legalists the pharisees were those who loved rule and order and structure and the religion and they just kept piling more on and adjusting the rules and adapting them and making the rules and then you had the sadducees and the sadducees were the liberals in that day and they both were part of the chief priest and they were unified together for the casting out of jesus and i just would like to talk about this legalism and liberalism for a moment because you find out that they're opposite ends of the same thing they are the same thing and there's something that the devil has used to appeal to two different natures of people but it brings them into the same trap whether it's liberalism or what we i would call i would call disgraceful grace grace to disgrace is what brother brahma said or legalism and they're both providing people the same thing in a different way and they're both unified together against christ brother ben said in the message you must be born again he said not trying to squeeze in a calvinistic belief now you see i'm not in saying this now saying this know that i'm talking to a legalist people that's not it at all because i'm a legalist too but believe this that calvin had something and so did armenian have something and they both had something but they run off on the deep ends of it the calvin is saying well i'm saved and just that settles it his life proves that he isn't then he isn't saved the calvinist says i'm just saved that's it amen once saved always saved and brother ben i'm aligned very much with what calvin taught in many many ways but he's starting to talk about he's starting to separate this out he said his life proved that he isn't then he isn't saved and the legalist says i've got to do this and i must do this and i must do that then if you're not born again you're still not saved so there you are see it's in between in the middle of the road is where we've got to stay what are you what is calvinism what is what grace is is what god did for you but what works is what you do for god an appreciation of what he did for you through grace that's the whole answer then if i'm saved then i live like i'm saved but i couldn't live like i could live like i was saved and not be saved that's the fallacy of legalism i could live like i'm saved and not be saved but if i'm saved i'll live like i'm saved so see if the fact then brings it to the spot that we must be born again so the born-again experience tells what we are it doesn't mean i believe in shouting in all manifestations and not demonstrations of the spirit but yet that's not it yet it's something different from that it's a new creature something in the heart so brother branham is starting to speak about this calvinism uh which he says is extreme grace and then armenianism which would be legalism and he's telling us it's right in the middle and in marriage and divorce he says it's just like today there's two great schools of doctrine in the church one of them is calvinism the other one is armenianism one of them is legalist the other one is grace and we come to find out that the people who believe in grace the calvinist they say bless god it don't hurt me to smoke it don't hurt me to drink i can do these things i've got eternal security then we find the other side on the legal it said oh i would like to ball them out i would like to show them a piece of my mind but i'm a christian i have to keep still see you find yourself on two different roads and neither one of them is right oh i hope we can catch that neither one of them is right now you know there's no reason for me preaching this if we're going to find it everywhere else amen but these are the spirits that try to creep in all around us pharisees and or sadduceeism amen extreme grace or legalism and what legalism wants to produce something that you can do to feel secure that you're saved a works a a a a system an approach something that that you can do amen you can dress right and i mean you know the truth of the matter is if you've got god in your heart amen you've been born again by the spirit of god and that seed is quickened that seed is the word it'll take all the word and it'll manifest all the word so you know that that word in that word it's not right amen for a woman to cut her hair it's not right for her to dress like a man it's not right for a man to dress like a woman these things are not right the dirty jokes and the vulgarity and it's not right amen so the seed inside will produce the life that aligned to the word amen but what the legalist will do is try to produce a work say man a set of instructions an order of operation in the church amen so that the devil can take that order of operation and he can begin to build a false security it's where a woman won't cut her hair and she won't dress him modestly and a man won't tell dirty jokes and they'll kick a tv out of their house and won't listen to the wrong music and and then all of a sudden you realize that after a while in this vein of thinking that you begin to study the message to find the new church order under the legalistic thinking we begin to study the message and as we study the message we would never admit to this but under a legalistic teaching and under a legalistic spirit when that pharisee spirit which is not dead [Music] would come and try to trip up the church of god amen under that pharisee spirit you would begin to start studying the message and in studying the message the motive behind it would to be defined what the order of the church is so that i can keep the order so that i can feel okay and if you have a temperament like mine where you're a square with pointy corners and you like rules amen and you read the rule book before you play the game then that system works okay for you because just tell me what to do and i'll do it what do i have to do to be right well you can't cut your hair uh unless you're a man get the tv out of your house watch what you watch watch what you say come to church every time the doors are open because there's a quote for that make sure you pay your tithes give an offering on top of that because we've got scripture for that and lay it out for me i just want to know what the rules are now this isn't the words we used but this is the spirit that gets behind that and then i'll i just want to if i can keep the rules then if i can look like a believer and talk like a believer and fellowship with the believers then i can feel like a believer but feeling like a believer doesn't make you a believer it doesn't make me a believer and under the legalistic style you find now because you're always trying to feel like a believer you always got to be finding more rules because you feel like a believer when you can keep the order of the message now the order of the message is not wrong it's right but it depends on your approach because it's just the word of god but then because we want to feel justified we want to know what the rules are or what the order are so we really like it when a minister burns us up and when he really tears us and rips to hide off amen why because i'm finding security in conforming to the rules now there's not nothing wrong with a minister taking the height off when there's a good hiding that's needed but you can see how we could gravitate amen ourselves to a ministry that'll constantly line us up line us up line us up line us up if lining up makes us feel secure if lining up makes us feel like a believer because i do everything brother benham said praise god amen but you have no security in the grace of god you have no security in your bridegroom you have no joy in your salvation amen you have no peace in your heart you're rejecting the peace that comes from the bridegroom trying to find security in an order amen and then when we feel a little insecure we just want daddy to give us another weapon from the pulpit so that i can say i agree with that so i can feel like a believer again amen i hope the devil's getting exposed but then you have the flip side where the sadducees were secure because of who they were and what they were associated with the security came from the fact that they were jews and they had the right religion but not from belief in the word because the bible says that they did not believe in resurrection they did not believe in angels and did not believe in spirits they were rejecters of the word but they felt totally comfortable because they were jews and they were in jerusalem and they were part of the system because i'm part of a message church i'm in the message because i've i've joined the right church amen because you can take either side of this amen on the legalistic side when we begin to find out that my doctrine wasn't right oh my baptist doctor does it right i realize now my baptist doctor knows that right oh it scares me that my baptist doctrine was wrong tell me what the right doctrine is so i can believe the right doctrine so i can feel safe on the sadducees side it's not about the right or wrong doctrine it's about the right church if i'm associated with the right thing if i'm part of by joining myself to the right church the right movement the right belief system then i'm okay and they're both wrong one is searching the message for an order that can be kept to bring security and this side also starts to feel more secure when they can find faults in others that leads to more security because i know the word enough to know you're wrong that makes me right amen and so we can preach about everybody else is wrong and everything else is wrong and this is wrong and that's wrong and you're wrong and you're your mother is wrong your answer wrong and every other church is wrong and what's the implied message we're right if we can find what's wrong everywhere else then the implied message is we must be right and you can be correct in your observations and still be wrong in your heart or we can take this side and we say what the baptist church is wrong what's right the message is right all right i'm in the message if the message is right i'm in the message no real change either way no heart change no conversion no new birth no new creature no life of christ on the inside just an outward confirmation conformity and an outward joining amen just so that we can feel comfortable and we can get to the place where we can build a system amen taking truth nothing wrong with the word nothing wrong with the truth but with the wrong approach to the truth we can begin to build a wrong security because our approach is wrong and we can build a false security to where because we can keep the rules and because we can see where everybody else doesn't keep the rules then we are right or because i'm part of what's right it automatically makes me right no matter what i do on the side or when nobody's looking or my private life at home that doesn't matter because i'm in the message and we don't want either one of those there's there's enough truth to either one to make them deceptive but the real truth is right in the middle i can live like i'm saved and not be saved but if i'm saved i'll live like i'm saved it's all about creating a false sense of security and on either one when you begin to take away the security the teeth come out on either side if you begin the the to talk about the grace of god amen on the legalist side and begin to expose a false security and when the teeth come out amen and then they start finding fault in you and well you don't do that and your church doesn't do that and i'm they're just looking for a reason to scratch you off the list so that they don't have to hear to the exposing words that's making nakedness until we scratch so many people off the list there's nobody left so who's in the authority the only one left was scratched and scratched and scratched and scratched and scratched but you can get on this other side of where it's all about being part of the group and all of a sudden being a message believer is somebody who goes to a message church and believes that god sent a prophet and can begin to allow the world to creep into their life and can begin to dabble with uh the things that you know we used to run out the kind of music and clothing and entertainment and things that were not accepted now begin to get accepted amen and then under this system of grace under this extreme grace or what i call aggressive grace if you begin to point out what the prophet taught on those things if you just begin to point out what the prophet said about how we should dress and and and what entertainments we should have and what we should kick out of our house what we should allow and what we should not allow it and just begin to talk about those things all of a sudden who begins to defend the unbelief the church begins to defend the unbelief and all of a sudden you become critical and judgmental does that happen to any of you it's happened to me you become you have a critical judgmental spirit because you don't care about that person amen you're just all you care about is dressing right looking right and all that and all you've done is try to say this isn't what the prophet taught why are we letting this in the church why are we moving this why aren't we correcting this why aren't we changing this amen this is not what the prophet taught and when you begin to bring the word amen and expose the nakedness they'll let you know right away that you've got a critical judgmental spirit you don't care about people you have no love and you might be serpent seed that sounds crazy but that's exactly the path it takes exactly i've already been down that path until you go to talk to the pastor about what the prophet said and you end up leaving like there's something wrong with you and you're the believer you just believe what he said you believe what he said it's true and with something we should live by and all of a sudden you walk away and you feel like there's something wrong with you that you're critical that you're judgmental that you don't care about people you have no love you don't have the love of god and there's something wrong with you and then you begin to question am i the believer what happened the church became the defender of unbelief the protector the harbor the pastor will begin to harbor over unbelief praise god now don't misunderstand me we're not talking about a visitor we're not talking about somebody who's a teenager never had their experience yet but we're talking about people who know the message amen it's claimed to have an experience live victorious for years and all of a sudden these things begin to creep back in and now we begin to bring things in amen to what's called the message that was never permitted before and the worldliness begins to get in amen but but because we're in the message we're okay that's the spirit that was on the sadducees we're fine amen and all sudden the high heels come in and the short skirts and the tight clothes amen and the makeup but we can find a quote where brother bam said you know and all of a sudden all of a sudden the church becomes the protector of unbelief see the devil is so subtle and so deceptive so subtle and so deceptive that he'll gather a group of people and put a label over that group of people and because you love the people and want to be with the people whether you've had experience or not he'll let you believe you're okay and you may be far from okay the jews believed they were okay but they were far from okay they had generations of keeping the order generations of being part of the system until they got so inoculated so accustomed to the system that when jesus christ showed up they wanted caesar instead talk about extreme that's extreme but i don't ever want to get to the place where jesus christ comes knocking on my door with a revelation that i want my system and my comfort in my way of thinking so much that i'll reject him when he reveals himself to me today because he is the unveiled god unveiling himself to his bride today and i want all that he has for me and i don't want to get so settled down and so comfortable being part of something that i'm okay i've got the rules down pat that i'm okay but i want to constantly say i need the every hour i need the i want thy eyesalve i want thy gold i want thy raiment i want everything that you have for me i'm not okay till i've got all of you and i'm not okay until my atoms change i'm not okay until i shift dimensions and completion i i'm not okay i want to keep seeking and i want to i want to stay open to him and i don't want to enter into a walled city i want to stay outside the camp i don't want to settle down i don't want to fall security i want my security to come from my relationship with jesus christ the fact that he's unveiled himself to me and still unveiling himself to me that there's a love affair that there's a relationship back and forth that there's a reality to it amen not a system not an order not a form not a ritual but him the person of the word united with me constantly whispering love secrets in my ear that's our security friends not a pharisee system not a sadducee system amen no church system but our security comes from him the message cannot be denominated because the message is him but it doesn't mean that people who associate themselves around the message cannot have denominational spirits circling around it does not mean that you do not have denominational spirits trying to infiltrate your mind trying to move you off your security and christ and trying to bring you to another security on this side or this side amen to get you to a place where you've just settled down am i met jesus christ i've had my experience i'm okay and now yeah i know i shouldn't be looking at that i know i shouldn't be watching that i i know i i know i know but god understands praise god or be over here and i'm so tore up and hateful and bitter and critical because i have to constantly keep an order that's not real to my soul i'm constantly constantly chaining myself back to keep the rules i've got long hair and a long skirt enough temper to fight a buzzsaw and go to a church that's got the order down pat and keep the order down pat keep all the rules and do it all but so contentious and hateful in our family that all our children see is not the life of christ but a mom and dad that's always at each other's throats but yet we go to the right church that has the right order and we keep all right and mom's never cut her hair and she's never wore a short skirt but so much tension in the home because it's not the life of christ it's a put on and ever whenever you begin to put on the religion on the outside and put on the order on the outside when it's not coming from the inside out but the outside in amen when that happens corruption always starts in the inside and that corruption goes into hiding because your security comes from being right in the right church and right in the eyes of the other believers so the corruption moves inside deep inside and now amen privately you become very corrupt but publicly you become very correct because it's an outside in not an inside house doesn't matter you say i believe everything brother benjamin said and i do everything he said do but if you've not been born again you're still not right you say i believe every word of god i believe everything the prophet said but if you your life still won't line to the word still not let's go right matthew 23. i'm going to read a couple more scriptures i'd like to make this statement if your children don't know you're a believer you're not a believer if your wife doesn't know you're a believer you're not a believer because we can act a certain way for a certain period of time and a certain but those who know us most know us knows the truth they know the reality matthew 23 13. 23-13 but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in you have become you can't go but you've become a barrier to others going let's go down to verse 25. well unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess thou blind pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and the platter that the outside of them may be clean also woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for your like unto white sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness even so you also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity they look good but they weren't good they kept the order but it wasn't enough jesus come in contact with a rich young ruler one day he begins to ask him questions and the rich young ruler begins to answer into the affirmative to jesus all this i have done since my youth i've kept all the orders i've kept all the rules and when jesus questions him and you know the commandment to do this do this do this and he says all this i've done from my youth and jesus looked right down at his heart and he realized here was a man who loved himself morning loved god and he went right to the heart and said but sell all that thou hast and give to the poor and come and follow me he had an opportunity to walk with the word to walk with jesus christ and he turned his back on jesus christ for the real love of his heart which was his riches outside perfect stand in the face of jesus and say i've done it all but he did not have a heart that loved god more than his riches brother ben said in the message thirsting for life he said oh i've seen people shout dance in the spirit speak with tongues and enough temper to fight above saul and go out and live every day ungodly and half dress themselves and do shady deals and everything like that brother that's not fruits of the spirit come on back to the bible come back to the fountain come back and receive christ these other little things will take care of themselves as long as you receive christ and the life is going with it these other things will flow freely but don't try to get the other things before you get christ he is the fountain of life the only resource and he's the inexhaustible fountain of life you cannot exhaust his goodness and his mercy i want to look at philippians quickly there's several scriptures i want to go to keep your bibles handy we'll flip through these philippians chapter 3. philippians chapter 3 and verse 4. though i might also have confidence in the flesh this is the apostle paul speaking if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in his flesh more circumcise the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew of the hebrews as touching the law of pharisee concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless but what things were gained to me those i count lost for christ yea doubtless and i count all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but done that i may win christ paul in the jewish religion had it all going galatians 1 13 he says for you have heard of my conversion in times past in the jews religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it and profited in the jews religion above many mine equals in my own nation be more being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of the fathers paul he was benefiting more so than all his brethren in the jewish religion he had zeal he was a pharisee of the of the stock of benjamin a hebrew of the hebrew circumcised on the eighth day he had everything right he was wrong and when he heard a voice that came from the light that exposed his neckiness he was willing to leave all and take that voice he counted it all but dung that he might win christ let's look at revelation 18. revelation 18 and 1. and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the greatest fallen has fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit in the cage of every clean and hateful bird what is he talking about he's talking about religion where are all these unclean spirits and hateful birds and religion for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached into heaven and and god has remembered her iniquities reward her even as she rewarded you and double under her double according to her works and the cup which she has filled to her double how much she had glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart i sit a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow the blindness of the s of satan's religion therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong as the lord who judges her she had gotten to this place this religion this this catholic religion this babylonian spirit and gone to the place where she sat as a queen of heaven and said i will see no sorrow and in one hour her plagues come and she's destroyed she's so convinced by the deception of the devil that she's right and she's so utterly wrong miserable wretched blind naked and knoweth it not that's what this veil has done in this day brother baby says in the message of grace he said but now according to the prophecy there will come the headstone and i want you to notice that when the headstone comes the prince that's going to cry out the message will cry grace grace for it's by grace are we saved not out of works lest any man should boast and the message of grace has been trampled under the feet of men until it's become a disgrace some of them runs out into eternal security some runs out into oh everything but the true message of grace remains the same and that's where satan tries to knock it out from the church but it's the grace of god that we're all saved by amen and the message the token motherboard says a young fellow said the other day god loves me so well god is so so is a good god that is true but he's a god of anger too he's a god of judgment he's a god of wrath we fail to get that you make him so good till you make him some old dodie grandpa he's not no doty grandfather he is almighty god and he don't have no grandchildren he has sons and daughters of god not shook hands and adopted in you must be born again and the blood applied it's sons and daughters of god not some old soft grandfather let his kids get by grandchildren get by with anything he is not a grandfather he's a father yes sir every child must be born of him he's a father of correction so we get over to the sadducees system when we make when we have this aggressive grace where anybody that comes against this grace is the one who's evil and get to the place where we can begin to believe because i believe the message because i'm in the message everything will be fine with me if you're an elect predestinated seed of god you will be fine but in order for god to get you fine you may not feel fine for a while because he's a father of correction who will not let you get away with anything amen he owns you you've been bought with a price you're not your own amen and he's going to make sure that his word is not violated by his children amen he's not a grandfather he's not soft and dirty it's not because i say i believe the message i go to a message church that i can begin to dabble in the things that the prophet told us to stay away from [Music] but he's a god of correction that'll bring us back to the word praise god let's go to matthew and read a couple scriptures together i want to finish painting this picture that we started earlier when we get to the chief priests and elders we're talking about the united body of the pharisees and sadducees and herodians and all the jews together but this united body was mainly made of the sadducees and pharisees and in matthew 26 verse 3 it says then assembled together the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people and to the palace of the high priest who was called caiaphas and consulted that they might take jesus by septility and kill him this setility is by craft or by guile these men were so holy and so righteous and so pious that they would broaden their phylacteries and when they would when they would make an offering they would blow a trumpet so everybody can see them putting offering in and when they stood on the corner they would make long boastful prayers so everybody knew how religious they were but in the back room in private they were going to try to use craftiness and subtility to have a man killed it doesn't matter how good you look and how what part of what true system you are you are what you are in private you are what you are in the privacy of your heart matthew 27 verse 62. matthew 27-62 this is after jesus crucifixion he's been buried and now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and the pharisees came together into pilate saying sir we we remember that the deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days i will rise again command therefore that the sepulcher be made sure unto the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he has risen from the dead so the last error shall be worse than the first pilate said unto them you have a watch go your way make it as sure as you can so they went and made the sepulcher sure sealing the stone and setting a watch not only did they conspire to have the word killed they were wanting to make sure the words stayed dead and they wanted to ensure that the word stayed locked behind the roman seal but they confessed that they remember while he was alive that he said after three days he would raise again they have ears and understanding let's go to chapter 28. and verse 11. so after jesus resurrected an angel came and rolled the stone away the watch that was set fell down as dead men now it says now when they were going behold some of the watch came into the city and showed unto the chief priest all the things that were done well we're done angel came we felt as dead rolled the stone away and when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers saying say ye his disciples came by night say lie the most holy people the most holy ones in the holy church in the most holy place you understand friends that whenever the word begins to challenge the religion amen man who is not ready to receive christ man who doesn't have a capacity to receive christ he will take his religion and crucify christ if he has to lie if you have to make up stuff about the prophet if he's got to look in his bible and know that water baptism in jesus name is true he's got to come up with some excuse to hold the people in the religion they become liars they they become murderers they've become deceivers why did they do it all so that they could maintain their position and their nation and man that they could hold their form and hold their religion because it's the thing that gave them comfort and you may think that's crazy but i know some of you have been in churches and systems amen they even claim to believe the message that would go through the same kind of manipulation in life amen to hold the system in place because it was the system of the church and the ministry that gave them comforts and people will let it go on because they feel comfortable because it's bringing a security in the church under the ministry there's nothing new under the sun everything that is has been before told the soldiers gave large money into the soldiers saying say ye his disciples come by night and stole him away while we slept and it has come to the governor's ears we will persuade him and secure you so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is commonly reported among the jews unto this day what were they defending their security they had already confessed we remember that while the deceiver was alive he said that he would raise after three days and here comes some of their own wash to testify they had seen the angel the stone was rolled away and come and showed them all things and they said listen say this tell them his disciples came and if the governor has anything they will stick up for you i tell you religion is dirty filthy deceitful the devil is using religion to harbor unbelievers these pharisees were unbelievers they didn't even believe the law of moses he said if you believe moses you would believe me and they didn't even believe the ten commandments friends they would not even stop lying that's one of the commandments written on stone that's on that line here they are absolute unbelievers but the religion under satan amen so promoted them that they come to the highest position that they could come under this religion and it was it was a true religion friends it was established by god but satan had gone in and began to work through people amen and promotion and manipulation they climbed till they got to the highest seat and they were absolute unbelievers in the word of god and every action they took with jesus christ proved that they were unbelievers but you know what happened after jesus resurrected amen and he went and then and then now the truth begins to spill out they cover it up and cover it up and cover it up and persecute truth and persecute truth why because they're protecting the thing that gives them security and gives them positions they'll marry the romans to stay here [Music] brother venom already told us that all these denominations will marry the roman system so they can keep their system because rome doesn't care how you worship as long as you're part of the system rome didn't care that they were jews he didn't care that herod built them a tent pep temple all they cared is that they participated in the system if you participate in the system you can believe whatever you want we'll even send you funds to build your temple of worship as long as you participate in the system and the only threat to the system is somebody will speak the truth and jesus became such a threat to their security to their through their attachment to the system he so threatened their security amen that they would kill a man who did nobody any physical harm and had never committed a crime they threw daniel in the lion's den when he had never physically harmed anybody and never threatened a person they took the three hebrews and then they threw them into a fiery furnace amen they had never physically harmed anybody they posed no danger to anybody i mean they were not a threat but they would take them and throw them into a fiery furnace that was heated seven times why because they were a threat to nebuchadnezzar's unified form of worship not because they were a physical threat to anybody not because they were a threat to the kingdom not because they were posing any physical threat whatsoever the threat they were was to the security that was coming from the false union that's why ahab threw macaya into the inner chamber and to the south because macaya by speaking the truth amen he become a threat to the false union of ahab and jehoshaphat and all he did was tell him the truth and they asked him to they called him they asked him and he tried to let him off the hook he said go up go on up he knew they wouldn't receive it he said you're just going up and he said haven't i told you before just tell me what the lord says he told him exactly what the lord said ahab knew that was the word of the lord but because it threatened this new false unity that became between jehoshaphat and ahab he threw him into the inner chamber why because the truth was a threat to the religious system amen you see why the devil wants the devil would want people who are associated with this message to take the message and make it a religion because if they do they'll be willing to protect the religion because the religion becomes the security and they will be willing to compromise amen they will be willing amen to give in to keep what is my security but if your security comes from your personal relationship with jesus christ and your identification by this word it doesn't matter what they do to the church it doesn't matter if they scatter us as believers it doesn't matter if they throw me in the inner hall they cannot separate me from the love of god that is in christ jesus because it's been revealed to me personally shut the doors to the church will not stop anything amen but the devil would like to take religion and have us have a false security so that we have a need to protect our false security amen if your security in christ and nobody believes what you're saying it's okay nobody believed mikaya he was fine with that nobody believed jeremiah he was fine with that nobody believed isaiah he was fine with that because their security did not come from the system their security came from god himself that's why religion is a barrier to god amen it doesn't bring you to god it's not the upholder of truth it's the protector of unbelievers it's the sheltering amen of the unbelievers but god is going to have a bride because he said he would that would not fall by this system of religion not because she's better wiser smarter she's learned more over time but because he said he would have it in this day he will have it in his day and because he said he would have it in this day he had to ensure that it would be here so to ensure that he'd be there he had no option but to come himself so he didn't just leave it to you he said i'll come in you and do the work amen all you've got to do is receive it amen accept it amen open yourself to me and he would come himself and do it in this day and the message broken cisterns it says today i was talking with my good friend dr lee's zale which is present now and he's quite a theologian and so we usually have some pretty good discussions on scripture very smart and he asked me one time what i thought about the initial evidence of the holy ghost was speaking in tongues it's been many years ago i said no i can't see that he said neither do i said though i've been taught that he said what would you think would be the evidence i said the most perfect evidence i can think of is love and so we got to talk on that and then i thought that sounded pretty good so i just held that if a man has got love but one day the lord in a vision straightened me out and he said the evidence of the spirit was those who could receive the word neither love nor speaking tongues but it's receiving the word see the religious system in the roman system which is the babylonian system which is nebuchadnezzar system which is nimrod system which is cain system do we believe that is not based on faith it is based on participation if you participate then you're accepted if you come to church and pay your ties and you don't cut your hair and you wear the right kind of dress you're accepted if you're a baptist and you believe the baptism you're accepted you're accepted by participation not by faith but in christ he only accepts faith but the system is comfortable with participation because you can be given a sign in the forehead or a sign in the hand and the forehead is your mental agreement with the system or sign in your hand is what you do about it or giving in to it or supporting it so you don't even have to believe it if you support it they're still okay with that participation brings unity unity brings a false sense of security i want you to remember that participation brings unity unity brings a false sense of security our unity as we've said before is not just a lateral unity but we're unified in christ so if i am united with christ and you're united with christ then we're automatically united but we can't unify down here to be unified to christ that's a false union so if we can all unify here to feel like we're unified to christ there can be deception that enter in and bring a false union and a false security but if we individually unify with christ then we are automatically unified with one another and then when christ goes up if there's a string attached to you and you and you and you and you and all to christ in the middle of all of us and when christ lives off the earth guess what happens to all of us whammo we go together not because we unified ourselves together because we unified with christ [Music] and that brings a stronger unity than any earthly units brother bram says in the pergament church age he said the evidence of the spirit-filled christian believer is not to produce the truth you catch that that's a statement the evidence of the spirit-filled christian believer is not to produce the truth and in parentheses he put the word but to receive the truth the word and to believe and obey it so brother man when he says the greatest the the lord straighten him out that vision the greatest evidence is receiving the word god knows what is lip service and what is real because you can say you receive the word but that doesn't mean you receive the word that means you that could mean you want to be identified in the right group but it doesn't automatically mean you receive the worry but it's to receive the truth the word and to believe it and obey it in the smyrna church age he says now we have been constantly saying that the true evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost is for the believer to receive the word for the age in which he lives in the token he says don't just come this far say i believe the message you obey the messenger come into christ you say well i believe every word said brother that's good but that's just being able to read take the message take it into your heart that you must have the token the very life that was in christ be in you when i see that i will pass over you see it's not a mental acknowledgement amen it's not an agreement amen it has to be an actual receiving the word for your day what does it mean to receive the word for your day it means to receive christ in his fullness because he is the word for your day and to become one with him but if the token was not there the covenant was not in effect it was a gnome same now no matter how much you say how much you'd say i believe every word in the bible say brother branham i can quote you half the bible all the bible by heart i believe every bit of it that's good satan does too it takes the token amen again in the token he says they're not come together we've not come together to talk about the message we are come together to get in the message and the message is christ he is the word so you cannot join the message you cannot become part of the message by going to a message church although i believe if you're in the message you'll go to a church that preaches the message but you cannot you cannot join the message you cannot sign up for the message you cannot become part of the message you have to be birthed and do it amen you've got to come into christ he is the message he is the word that's right we're to get into it get beneath it yes sir that's what we're supposed to do he was not responsible for any person out from under the blood not one no matter who he was he was not responsible all had to take all had to take not only himself but his whole family they're only safe when the token was displayed we cannot feel safe until this token is displayed that's right you must come under this token god's holy spirit and it displays to you jesus christ because it comes and lives in you amen it displays to you jesus christ because it comes and lives in you it's a new birth he said in christ the mystery of god revealed now peter when he called said thou art christ the son of the living god now watch blessed art thou simon barjona which means son of jonah blessed art thou for flesh and blood never revealed this to you you never learned it from some school but my father which is in heaven has revealed it to you notice what he said to him upon this rock that's peter the predestinated seed of god that had received this light and given the keys to the kingdom upon this rock of revelation of who jesus christ is he is the full manifested god upon this rock not a father son and holy ghost and him being the second person upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell will never shake it down never prevail against him i'll build my church upon this rock a revelation of jesus christ i want to ask you what is the book of revelation the revelation of jesus christ that's why there had to be a prophet in the end time that would open that book amen because the church is built on the revelation of jesus christ and in the end time he would open the revelation of jesus christ which is the mystery of god revealed look christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what god is trying to do god is trying to get that full measure of jesus christ united into a church on the earth amen christ in you the hope of glory christ knew united as one that's what this message came to do the forerunner was here the forerunner's coming he came to do what he came to unite with the bride so that the bride could what she could manifest christ again [Music] some people are taking the message and looking for a new order to build a church system by so that will now be correct because we found out the bad this wasn't correct and but now we have an order that's correct some people will take the message and look for the sure loopholes to fight the legalists but they're going to be a group of people that's going to take the message and look for christ i'm not interested in a church order i don't have the message for a new church order the message didn't come for a new church order although he preached church order he set the church in order but the message didn't come to bring us a new church order so that we could be happy with the new church order he came to restore the word so that we can meet our bridegroom amen we can meet our bridegroom jesus christ the word the revealed word some people want the new church order that's now now we're correct some want to feel correct by joining to a system but there's a bride who's not looking for a security in an order or a security in a system she's looking for him amen this is him this message is him he came down he came and opened the seals he came and gave the revelation the lamb has to take the book the lamb has to open the seals this message came to reveal him to her and she's looking for him and the message not an order not a loophole not a system not a false security she's looking for him and every time she goes back to the message and goes to the bible she's not looking for another rule to tackle the rules to feel more secure she's not looking for another miracle that proves that brother ben was a prophet so that i know i'm not aligned to the right thing she's looking for him in every line if you go to the bible read every line don't see christ go back and read it again amen how am i going to see it amen that's what the opening of the word came to do to show you christ he's the whole word he's the whole bible now she's not looking for a system she's not looking for a security she's looking for him he came and unveiled himself to a bride who wanted to see him some go one way some go the other but the bride just wants to see him christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing what's he saying what's the whole thing he foreshadowed it in eden way back in genesis when he took his son and he put him in dominion over the earth and out of his son he pulled a wife a bride and united two together and said be one flesh and that was his masterpiece family and he put him in dominion over his creation amen and then the devil slipped in and he brought that masterpiece to ruin but he's been through the entire bible building back this masterpiece and when he got through the old testament he had reestablished the last atom amen but on calvary you opened up a side so he could take out the ingredients for a bride and now and through the new testament he's been building back that bride but in the end time amen he's going to unite the two back together and christ in the bride christ in you makes you the revelation of the whole thing because it's come back to a union to one flesh again you are flesh in my flesh the bone of my bone and life of my life where is christ he's in her christ in you amen is the complete revelation of the whole thing see what god is trying to do amen he's trying to get people to stop at a forerunner ministry got the message we've got the books we've got church order we've got our churches we've got our preachers we've got everything and we're sitting here under the forerunner ministry waiting for something to happen but christ in you is the revelation of the whole thing what the prophet came for what did he come for he come to announce his coming what coming he come in bride form and the formation of the bride he's here working in and through his bride to complete his works christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what god is trying to do if you catch that revelation friend you don't need a church system amen you don't need a set of rules you don't need a program you don't need anything to find security when you realize it's christ in you the individual not a group of people but christ in me the hope of glory christ in me his plan from the beginning christ in me in the end time what he foresaw before the foundation of the world this is why the prophet came this is why we have a message so that he could come alive inside a people on the earth christ in me as an individual i don't need a system an order a structure all i need is him [Music] that's why he came and that's what keeps us free from religion see what god is trying to do oh i pray that he helps us see it i hope that we see it clearer and clearer every day what is the new birth then you'd say well brother branham what is a new birth it's the revelation of jesus christ personally to you amen now you joined a church you shook a hand you done something different you said a creed you promised to live by a code of rules but christ the bible he is the word that was revealed to you no matter what anybody says what takes place it's christ pastor priest whatever it might be it's christ in you that is the revelation that the church was built upon you say well i'm a lutheran i'm a baptist i'm a presbyterian that don't mean one thing don't mean that to god not a thing not a snap of your finger what is it it's christ being revealed and he is the word and when the word is revealed it expresses itself what god purposed for christ jesus christ was to express himself to take his own laws and live by his laws and fulfill his laws by death and christ god died in flesh in order to condemn sin in the flesh that he might bring to himself a glorious bride redeeming back that redeemed back that will believe only the word of god and not swap it like eve did for intellectual conception of man you see it that's christ's idea that's god's idea the new birth reveals this but the revelation this is christ again in christ mr god revealed but the revelation come through the blood see through jesus christ who is the blood of god creative blood in the womb of mary and paul knew him by revelation that's how we know him today the only way you could know him not say i'm a methodist that means nothing i'm a baptist that means nothing i'm a catholic that means nothing but by the revelation that god has revealed the word to you it doesn't matter if he's revealed it to your parents i mean it does matter you want him to reveal it to your parents but that's not good enough for you it's not even sufficient that he's revealed to everyone else in the church pastor and elders and everybody else but he's wanting to reveal it to you amen and by the revelation that god has revealed the word to you he is the word and the word how you know it's revealed it lives itself and expresses itself through you amen oh that kills it all that kills the pharisees spirit that kills the sadducees spirit how do you know it's revealed how do you know it's revealed it lives itself and expresses himself through you not what you've done what he did through you what he's doing through you amen not by keeping an order keeping a law but he himself doing it not you doing it him doing it not just living your way but he doesn't live in your way he lives according to the word amen if christ is revealed if that word is revealed it's a union a marriage between you and christ and he himself comes in in his lives his self his life his self through you amen praise god not i'm going to keep the church order to be okay i'm gonna search the message to find more rules so that i know i'm all right i'm gonna join myself to the right ministry so i'm okay no i'm only okay when he himself lives the word my motivation is not fear my motivation is not to be part of the group my motivation is not to fit in i'm not doing works to please anybody else in fact i'm not even doing works i'm just yielding to him and his spirit is taking me over and i'm a love sleep to jesus christ and now he has entered in and now as i feed on the word he's bringing the word to life inside of me amen now what i couldn't overcome now i'm overcoming when i couldn't stop now it stopped how's that happen because of a personal revelation of jesus christ to you don't need religion we don't need another order we don't need to join the right group i don't recommend you join the wrong group but i recommend that you open yourself to this word that is christ this message these message books are not a new system not a new form of belief not another religion in fact god didn't send a prophet so that we could have message books god sent a prophet so that he'd have a bride on the earth that he could live inside us the message came so there could be christ revealed in you which is the revelation of the whole thing it's the revelation of the whole message christ in his bride amen he's looking for a people who have something on the inside that says that's what i want that's what i've always wanted i may have got caught up in trying to keep rules i may got caught up in a system i may got caught up in a ministry but what i've always wanted is just to have you and what i've always wanted is just to have you and me and that i could die and that you could live and that's all i've ever wanted i've always loved you lord and that's all i've ever wanted how many can say that's all you've ever wanted amen that's what he wants to hear he's all he's ever wanted was for you to say i want you and you only he's going to have it he's in the process of having it because he promised amen that he would amen and if you're blessed by the grace of god to be part of that then you can't surrender enough you can't humble yourself enough you can't express your love enough just gratitude for the grace that has come into our lives what he's done and what he showed some people want to have a message as intellectual property but some people just want christ some people want to read and digest the message to understand the proper way to live to feel secure and be right but some people just want to read the message to fall in love with him to see him to open ourselves to him the message came oh just hear my heart god didn't send a prophet in this day and a message so that he could have a bunch of message churches god sent a message so he could have a bride there's nothing wrong with the churches with nothing wrong with us gathering like this there's no error there but let's not stop there he didn't come for for a new system a new form he came so that he could call his bride and so that he could unite with his bride so that the masterpiece could be restored let's all stand musicians if you could come by the blake if you could come praise god do you love him you love him because he first loved you and whenever i hear that it makes me love him more because it's not what i've done it's not what i could ever do it's what he's done for me you know why he sent this message in this last day so he could have me can you say the same thing that's what it's got to come to friends that's the revelation that he wants us to come to why did brother branham come why did he suffer with what he suffered why did he struggle why why did he have to come and preach why did he have to store up the food and make the tapes and why did he have to go through why all of that because he wanted me i'm part of the plan because he wanted to unite with me in this day and he wanted to come into a union and he wanted to be christ in me the hope of glory if you can get to that revelation if god can give you that awakening in your heart and that revelation personally no matter what happens you cannot lose your security no matter what happens you cannot lose your faith because it's you and him him and you let's just bow our heads and pray oh heavenly father we thank you lord jesus god we can't thank you is not enough lord for when you open the word to us you show us our position lord god i pray that you'd strip away every demon of religion that you'd move away every carnal idea god that you would strip from us that you would peel the veil away and expose every tactic of the enemy that would try to stumble us or slow us down well we thank you lord that you've ripped the veil in this day you put the sword in that prophet's hand and that sword has come down and ripped the veil you open the seals lord so that we would be guarded against the repeat of previous ages and god we just want to say we thank you lord and we love you for that we see what you're doing lord you're trying to have us to yourself not be manhandled you don't want a bride that's manhandled and manipulated you don't want it it's brought under a false religion in a false system but you want a bride virgin to yourself and you saw fit to have it you would send a prophet in this day to ensure that you would have a virgin bride and i say thank you lord help us god to yield more than we've ever yielded to you before help us to surrender all lord to die completely to our thinking completely to our desires to ourselves and unite with you only lord i pray lord you continue to reveal yourself to us and unveil yourself before us for that gives us life that gives us joy god if there's any here lord is desiring that individual revelation i pray you'd go to him now lord you'd quicken that life on the inside lord that you would speak to them that you would identify them lord that you would unite with them god for that is the purpose that you've come for in this day have your way with us o god wash us in your word cleanse us make us what you want us to be we yield to you lord in a new way lord just a fresh consecration tonight i want to say lord i want to be your love slave i want to be your bride i want to be a pleasing to you i want my eyes singularly focused on you and you alone lord i want everything else to fade away forgive me for every bit of carnality and selfishness lord and help me lord to make a full surrender to you for without you i can do nothing lord but you're drawing me i can feel it lord you're pulling me into a closer walk you're pulling me to a greater consecration god i yield to you let your word be alive in me oh and i lay myself at your feet and i say cover me with your skirt oh how i love you lord have your way with us have preeminence among us lord we thank you for your word lord we love you go with us go in us live through us help us to stay out of the way so that you can work in and through us we give you first place
