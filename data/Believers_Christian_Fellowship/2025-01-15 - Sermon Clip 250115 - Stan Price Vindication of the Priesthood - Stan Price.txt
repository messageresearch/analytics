TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Adam and Eve had a place of fellowship with God but it wasn't in their Humanity it was in the theophany that dwelt in them right because their theophany was created in the image of God so that was the only part you know outside and the prophet says it Adam's flesh was animal So Adam Adam's fellowship with God was not based on his flesh it was based on the this harmonious part that God had put in that flesh which was the theophany that was made in His image right and so here is Adam and Eve in harmony with God yet they're in flesh all right so watch so said now that's the first thing that disfellowship this wonderful Union but now look Adam and Eve in a position to never die because that's that was a position they were in a position to never die in a position to never be old yeah amen right in a position to never be sick to never have a worry and you say I sure wish I could be like that well let me I got news for you you are in the same position Redemption has done a work that we don't even recognize and so what so what is happened here okay Christ has redeemed us but we we have not been made manifest we don't because I came onto this Earth and I have a gene of God in meise that Gene of God listen to this is already there sitting there but I don't know who I am right right right I come into this world ignorant right not knowing who I am but Watch What Happens okay so he says I I beheld and I looked and L verse 6 in the midst of the throne of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven Harps seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth we could stop on this but we're not going to and he came and he took the book out of the hand of him that sat on the throne so this book The Lamb where did the lamb come from he came out of the throne amen am but he was not a separate person from the one that was sitting this is a parable it's a parable It's a drama that God is playing out because I want you to see that this is where you live the The Throne of God is in you and so what God is showing you is what Redemption did for you individually God and so the lamb what did he do he claimed you but you know what the prophet said I'm and I'm I'm fixing to show you what the prophet said he sat back down on the throne so what happened redemption's work had been accomplished because he opened he was the only one that could open this book that's right and so now he is in the throne yeah revealing Who You Are
