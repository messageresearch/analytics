[35:21] message across the world and we it is uh
[35:24] much because of your sacrifice and uh
[35:28] your faith in the word so we really
[35:29] appreciate you and everything that you
[35:32] do all those from Brother Franco up on
[35:34] the top to the Musicians the song
[35:36] leaders and just just wonderful people I
[35:39] wish uh the the Saints in duban could
[35:40] meet you all I always tell them uh
[35:43] stories when I get home of the wonderful
[35:46] saints of God when I come here so we
[35:49] really appreciate you amen and um
[35:52] so I wanted to uh you know I had it in
[35:56] my heart when I came here and I was
[35:58] wondering what to preach I wanted to do
[36:00] uh Dimensions part three part four part
[36:02] five part six but because I've got like
[36:05] four other parts to it and I thought
[36:07] well but it was too much to just try to
[36:10] cram into two service and I thought I
[36:11] just could never do it it was playing on
[36:13] my mind and what to do but uh God has
[36:17] given me something to speak which is
[36:18] something uh very special to my heart
[36:22] and uh it's actually the second service
[36:25] that I preached at the beginning of my
[36:27] Ministry
[36:28] uh something that really blessed me so
[36:31] much and uh opened up and kind of uh
[36:35] channel the way for what the ministry
[36:38] that God has put in my heart was going
[36:40] to do in um you know in my life there in
[36:43] Durban so I want to share that with you
[36:46] and of course since then God has added
[36:48] so much more to it and uh you know his
[36:51] revelation of it so we really appreciate
[36:53] it so we're going to take um a theme for
[36:57] the two meetings but I'm going to give
[36:59] you the theme at the end of tomorrow
[37:01] service amen so let's begin by reading
[37:05] Galatians chapter 3 verse 1 and through
[37:10] to
[37:12] 29 Galatians 3: 1-29 so I'd like to um
[37:19] not keep you too long but I was assured
[37:22] that if I preach less than two hours
[37:24] people were going to be offended so
[37:28] but we're trust in the Lord
[37:30] amen the word of God reads like this oh
[37:33] foolish
[37:34] Galatians who hath Bewitched you that
[37:37] you should not obey the truth before
[37:41] those eye before whose eyes Jesus Christ
[37:44] hath been evidently set forth crucified
[37:47] among you this only would I learn of you
[37:52] received you the Spirit by The Works of
[37:54] the law or by the hearing of faith are
[37:58] you so foolish having begun in the
[38:01] spirit are you now perfected by the
[38:04] flesh have you suffered so many things
[38:07] in vain if it be yet in
[38:11] vain he therefore that ministereth to
[38:13] you the spirit and worketh miracles
[38:16] among you doeth he it by The Works of
[38:19] the law or by the hearing of Faith even
[38:23] as Abraham believed God and it was
[38:25] accounted to him for righteousness
[38:28] know you therefore that they which are
[38:31] of Faith the same are the children of
[38:34] Abraham and the scripture foreseeing
[38:36] that God would justify the Heathen
[38:38] through faith preached before the gospel
[38:41] unto Abraham saying in the shall All
[38:44] Nations be
[38:46] blessed so then they which be of Faith
[38:49] are blessed with Abraham yes for as many
[38:53] as are of the works of the law are under
[38:56] the curse
[38:58] for it is written cursed is everyone
[39:00] that continueth not in all things which
[39:03] are written in the book of the Lord to
[39:05] do
[39:06] them but that no man is justified by the
[39:09] law in the sight of God it is evident
[39:12] for the just shall live by faith and the
[39:15] law is not of Faith amen but the man
[39:19] that doeth them shall live in them
[39:23] amen Christ hath redeemed us from the
[39:26] curse of the law being made a curse for
[39:29] us for it is written cursed is everyone
[39:32] that hangeth on a tree that The Blessing
[39:35] of Abraham might come on the Gentiles
[39:37] through Jesus Christ that we might
[39:40] receive the promise of the spirit
[39:42] through faith Brethren I speak after the
[39:46] manner of men though it be but a man's
[39:49] Covenant yet if it be confirmed no man
[39:53] disen knowth or addeth
[39:55] thereto now to Abraham and his seed were
[39:58] the promises made he saith not and to
[40:02] seeds as of many but as of one and to
[40:05] thy seed which is Christ and this I say
[40:08] that the Covenant that was confirmed
[40:11] before of God in Christ the law which
[40:14] was 430 years after cannot disel that it
[40:19] should make the promise of none effect
[40:22] for if the inheritance be of the law it
[40:25] is no more of promise
[40:27] but God gave it to Abraham by
[40:30] promise this is beautiful pay careful
[40:34] attention wherefore then serveth the law
[40:37] that means what is the purpose of the
[40:39] law it was added because of
[40:42] transgressions well that's obvious if
[40:44] there were no transgressions why would
[40:46] we need a
[40:47] law till but but what's the time limit
[40:51] till the seed should come to whom the
[40:53] promise was
[40:55] made and it was ordained by angels in
[40:59] the hand of a mediator glory to God the
[41:03] law was ordained by
[41:06] Angels uh in the hand of a mediator now
[41:09] a mediator is not of one but God is one
[41:12] is the law then against the promises of
[41:15] God God forbid for if there had been a
[41:18] law given which could have given life
[41:21] verely righteousness should have been by
[41:23] the law but the scripture had concluded
[41:27] all under sin that the promise of faith
[41:30] of Jesus Christ might be given to them
[41:32] that believe the last three verses but
[41:36] before Faith came we were kept under the
[41:40] law shut up unto the faith which should
[41:43] afterwards be
[41:45] revealed wherefore the law was our
[41:48] school Master to bring us unto Christ
[41:52] that we might be justified by faith but
[41:55] after that faith is come we are no
[41:58] longer under a school Master the Lord
[42:01] add a blessing to his word you may be
[42:05] seated
[42:06] amen so I want to speak on this subject
[42:11] and for a title the bond shall not be
[42:14] air with the free amen and obviously
[42:18] taken from the seed shall not be air
[42:20] with the shock but the bond shall not be
[42:24] air with the free amen amen so this is a
[42:28] very crucial Revelation given here by
[42:31] Paul and you see I want you to um we're
[42:35] just going to expound it out a little a
[42:38] little bit before we get to the actual
[42:40] subject it is human nature it is in you
[42:43] every one of you sitting right here it
[42:46] is in you to desire the law because the
[42:49] law feels
[42:51] safe right because human nature desires
[42:57] rather to have laws within which we can
[43:00] live and that's what gives us this sense
[43:03] of
[43:04] security why because law is something we
[43:07] can keep if someone gives you rules you
[43:10] can keep it and you kind of have
[43:12] guidance right and the law is tangible
[43:17] we can see its effects you can see when
[43:19] it tells you what to do and and if we
[43:21] don't do it there's a transgression and
[43:23] then there's a punishment for it so it's
[43:25] kind of something we can
[43:27] understand we see its effects we judge
[43:30] its results uh you can tell by as long
[43:34] as you have law you can tell when
[43:36] someone is a transgressor whether they
[43:38] transgress a little bit a little bit
[43:39] more more than anyone else right you can
[43:43] see its effects and with the law there
[43:45] is no guessing it tells you this
[43:48] particular offense is wrong it tells you
[43:50] that particular offence is wrong this
[43:52] this one here shouldn't be done or this
[43:55] should be left this law should be left
[43:57] for these Elders or that should be for
[43:59] the children it's very
[44:02] defining amen and uh there's no guessing
[44:05] with it either you are keeping it or you
[44:07] are
[44:08] not
[44:10] right Revelation is too scary for a
[44:16] church because nobody perceives things
[44:19] the same way so any good church like
[44:24] you fails to agree on every one
[44:29] point right the law makes things easier
[44:33] it's it's like when they came to Christ
[44:35] and they said just tell us if you are
[44:38] him like we're tired of asking you so
[44:41] many questions in different ways why not
[44:43] just tell us come out and tell us are
[44:45] you him or they do the same thing to
[44:47] John the
[44:48] Baptist and you never answer them the
[44:51] way they wanted right he even tells them
[44:54] if I tell you you won't even believe me
[44:57] yeah right but the law makes things
[45:00] easier or so it seems and if you can
[45:04] give everyone an agreed rule then we can
[45:08] judge it
[45:09] correctly see while you're sitting here
[45:12] you love the open book you love the word
[45:14] of God and yet in your heart you would
[45:17] think how nice it would be if all the
[45:20] churches in the message could just
[45:22] believe the same
[45:24] thing it would be so great no matter how
[45:27] much you know about the open book you
[45:29] still feel that inside wouldn't it be
[45:31] nice if we all had the same thing to
[45:33] believe if we all saw things the same
[45:36] way amen you know when I know you're a
[45:40] church that is well taught you love the
[45:42] word of God you love the open book and
[45:46] but that's why I believe I can speak
[45:48] this to you today because we can speak
[45:50] subjects that we cannot speak to other
[45:52] people we can take subjects and and and
[45:55] make it uh uh make us look deep into our
[46:00] intentions our desire past Church uh
[46:05] religion past message theology past
[46:08] ideology We can question our intentions
[46:11] We can question our desires that's what
[46:13] we want so the law you would agree make
[46:17] things easier right uh sometimes well if
[46:22] the law is severe it's hard for us but
[46:24] the fact that we know
[46:27] what the law says the law doesn't
[46:29] require
[46:31] Revelation and when when the law says
[46:33] Thou shalt not kill I mean nobody can
[46:36] misinterpret that right we know it and
[46:39] it's clear and no one can say well I was
[46:43] ignorant of it or I didn't understand it
[46:45] it's very
[46:48] simple so if you give everyone an agreed
[46:51] rule then it feels like we can judge it
[46:54] correctly in fact very often we expect a
[46:58] church to all do the same thing abide by
[47:02] cood and all keep it the exactly the
[47:05] same way amen the proof that the proof
[47:09] is that all of you here sitting here are
[47:11] dressed so differently tells you that
[47:13] Cod can be applied hundreds of different
[47:17] ways
[47:19] right now Paul is speaking to the
[47:22] Galatians here and and he's chastising
[47:25] them if you're reading the scripture
[47:26] this lengthy scripture we've read he's
[47:29] chastising them he's he's basically
[47:31] telling them uh you understand what the
[47:35] law is and that it was something that
[47:37] was leading us to something right you
[47:40] were he says you were once liberated by
[47:43] the spirit and by faith why are you
[47:45] Desiring to go back to the
[47:47] law see it's human nature when they have
[47:51] received a little Revelation uh and
[47:53] start to feel good about themselves then
[47:56] they want want to fall back to law yeah
[47:59] because suddenly we feel more confident
[48:02] in keeping the
[48:03] law are you hearing me so when you get
[48:07] stronger in Revelation you get stronger
[48:11] and and and and more confident and now
[48:13] you feel well I think I know this
[48:16] dressing perfectly I I can keep Church
[48:19] order better I can correct others with
[48:23] more
[48:24] maturity so you start falling back to
[48:27] the law even the you getting stronger in
[48:29] Revelation it's human nature to want to
[48:32] get more
[48:34] control right and that's a problem yeah
[48:38] the result was we brought ourselves into
[48:43] bondage and back when you do that
[48:46] instead of living by Revelation and
[48:48] Faith towards God when you Resort back
[48:50] to law you take yourself under bondage
[48:54] again and like Paul says under the curse
[48:57] of the law yeah what is the curse of the
[49:00] law that if you transgress according to
[49:03] the law you deserve the
[49:06] punishment the curse of the law was
[49:10] condemnation which brings a Believer
[49:12] into bondage and not Liberty in the
[49:14] spirit it also puts a halt on the flow
[49:18] of
[49:19] Revelation so if you living by law the
[49:21] flow of Revelation begins to slow down
[49:24] amen all right so I I want to speak on
[49:28] the Bond woman and the free
[49:31] woman uh and trusting the Lord to reveal
[49:34] these things to us it's a it's quite a
[49:37] wonderful subject that we want to get to
[49:39] so let's go to Galatians 4 verse 21 to
[49:44] 31 and I want to show you what Paul is
[49:46] saying about the Bond woman and the free
[49:49] woman amen are you with us glory to
[49:54] God tell me he says you that desire to
[49:58] be under the law do you not hear the law
[50:02] that means do you not understand the law
[50:05] for it is written that Abraham had two
[50:07] sons and the one by a bond made that's a
[50:12] slave woman and the other by a free
[50:16] woman but he that is the son of the Bond
[50:19] woman was born after the flesh but he of
[50:24] the free woman was by promise amen I I
[50:27] don't want to take too long I hope you
[50:29] understand that the the the free woman
[50:31] was Sarah and and the Bond woman was
[50:34] haga so the son of Hagar is Ishmael and
[50:36] the son of the free woman is Isaac and
[50:39] Isaac was the promised son Ishmael was
[50:42] permissive will right verse 24 which
[50:46] things are an allegory an allegory in
[50:50] English literature is a long complicated
[50:53] story with an underlying meaning okay uh
[50:57] for these are the two covenants the one
[51:00] from Mount Si which gendereth to bondage
[51:04] he's telling you Mount Si is the law of
[51:06] Moses and the law of Moses puts you on a
[51:09] bondage which is
[51:12] Hagar oh my the law of Moses which puts
[51:17] you under bondage is
[51:19] Hagar verse 25 for this hagga is Mount
[51:25] Si this this Paul must have been making
[51:28] a lot of people
[51:29] mad this Hagar is Mount Si in Arabia and
[51:33] anth to Jerusalem which now is and is in
[51:39] bondage with her
[51:41] children but Jerusalem which is above is
[51:44] free which is the mother of us
[51:46] all for it is
[51:49] written uh Rejoice thou Barren that
[51:52] bearest not break forth and
[51:55] cry um that thou that travail us not for
[51:58] the desolate hath many more children
[52:01] that she which hath an husband beautiful
[52:05] verse 28 now we Brethren as Isaac was
[52:09] are the children of
[52:10] Promise verse
[52:12] 29 but as then he that was born after
[52:15] the flesh persecuted him that was born
[52:18] after the spirit even so it is now
[52:23] nevertheless what sayith the scripture
[52:26] cast out the Bond woman and her son for
[52:29] the son of the Bond woman shall not be
[52:31] air with the son of the free woman so
[52:34] then brethren we are not the children of
[52:37] the Bond woman but of the free amen so
[52:41] we're giving you a little picture so
[52:43] there are many things that we can draw
[52:45] from this the Bond woman and the free
[52:47] woman let's break it down for us right
[52:50] the Bond woman is Hagar and who is Hagar
[52:54] she's a slave I want you to Bear all
[52:57] these points because we're now going to
[52:58] bring it back to you right the born
[53:01] woman is hagga and who is she she's a
[53:03] slave she is a woman without a
[53:07] husband she was Abraham was not her
[53:11] husband right but she's living under a
[53:14] covenant of
[53:16] obligation
[53:18] right obligated yeah right number two
[53:23] the free woman is Sarah who is Sarah
[53:26] she's a married woman she does not live
[53:30] under
[53:31] obligation but under a love
[53:35] Covenant hagga according to Paul is
[53:38] Mount Si which is the
[53:41] law Sarah is typed to Jerusalem of above
[53:46] which is Faith or
[53:48] Revelation amen now then the next one
[53:52] haga who is the law produces a son and
[53:56] who is a son he is the evidence of the
[53:58] law in other words what the law
[54:01] produces in the same way Sarah the who
[54:05] is Faith produces a son and her son is
[54:09] the evidence of
[54:10] Revelation amen so law will produce
[54:15] according to the scripture much more
[54:19] children much more evidence than
[54:22] children of Faith
[54:24] amen children of the law here's the
[54:27] other thing will persecute children of
[54:30] faith you'll never find children of
[54:32] Faith persecuting Children of the law
[54:35] right number nine children of law will
[54:39] never be hirs with Children of Faith do
[54:43] you understand that they will not
[54:46] inherit what we
[54:48] inherit and the last Point Perfection of
[54:52] children of Faith requires one thing
[54:57] the church and children of law must be
[54:59] completely and utterly cast out
[55:03] amen you cannot inherit the promise
[55:07] until you utterly and completely cast
[55:10] out the Bond woman and her son yeah amen
[55:14] that's why it requires that we
[55:16] understand this amen so we are not
[55:19] children of the Church of the law we do
[55:22] not come from Mount
[55:24] Si and I'm not talking about about the
[55:26] Jews yeah we are the children of
[55:30] Revelation amen we are Mount Zion we
[55:34] come from Mount Zion the children of
[55:37] just men the spirits of just men made
[55:40] perfect amen so let's talk about the
[55:43] church in bondage right people think
[55:47] that when when people read this and they
[55:49] think that the children of the law is
[55:51] Israel and that the children of the free
[55:54] is the church the Christian church and
[55:56] that's been taught for a long time but
[55:59] that's not what the prophet
[56:01] preached brother Mar preached that the
[56:04] church was in
[56:06] bondage and so did Paul when he spoke to
[56:09] the Galatians then the message people
[56:12] came in and they said well the church is
[56:16] the children of the law and the message
[56:18] people are the
[56:20] free they were they thought we're
[56:21] speaking about
[56:22] denominations the message people didn't
[56:25] realize they would become lawkeepers too
[56:29] and enslave people in bondage to the law
[56:33] too because that's the nature of humans
[56:36] to take anything with law restriction
[56:40] code
[56:41] Cod and put people into
[56:44] bondage it's human nature to do that why
[56:47] is it human nature to do that because
[56:49] it's the nature of the flesh that's
[56:51] right the flesh wants rules the flesh
[56:55] feels safe with rules the flesh feels
[56:58] safe with clear direct
[57:02] instructions but that's not what you're
[57:05] required to be living by amen let's go
[57:08] to um a quote here from evidence of the
[57:12] Resurrection uh the prophet says it must
[57:15] be something different look this this
[57:16] one quote here is one among many I just
[57:18] read it because it was the shortest one
[57:20] I chose this one he says I believe God's
[57:24] people are in bondage I believe they're
[57:27] in bondage because of tradition of
[57:30] man this is important what do We Gather
[57:33] from this it's so easy for us to make
[57:36] traditions that make the word of God of
[57:39] none effect amen and then we imprison
[57:41] ourselves by it amen and we lose out on
[57:44] the blessing that we should be achieving
[57:47] we should be attaining amen amen let's
[57:50] go to proof of his
[57:52] resurrection and the emancipation of the
[57:55] proclamation
[57:57] has been signed you're free and you just
[58:01] don't know
[58:02] it but Faith must have a Divine resting
[58:06] place if you have faith in God you've
[58:08] got to have some Divine resting place to
[58:12] place it amen I love those items we sang
[58:16] today um the specials in South Africa we
[58:19] call them
[58:20] items I just realized I got to adjust my
[58:22] South African
[58:24] language amen was the resting place
[58:28] resting in the presence of the Lord
[58:30] resting in the word manifesting in
[58:32] silence was just wonderful glory to God
[58:35] so if you have faith in God you've come
[58:37] to some Divine resting place to place it
[58:41] and there's no better place no other
[58:44] Divine Way only through God's holy word
[58:48] and we want to let our faith rest
[58:51] directly upon the written word of God
[58:54] Amen now man in his carnal condition and
[58:58] his mental conceptions he always pulls
[59:02] himself away from God so you agree what
[59:05] I'm telling you is what the prophet said
[59:07] amen even though God gives you a divine
[59:10] nature he gives you Revelation man in
[59:12] his carnal condition and mental
[59:14] conceptions pulls himself away how does
[59:16] he do it he starts forming Traditions he
[59:19] starts trying to live by law he starts
[59:22] turning Revelation what he learns by
[59:24] Revelation into law that must be kept
[59:27] into law that must be followed by other
[59:29] people why because of control he wants
[59:34] control man feels nervous when he feels
[59:37] like he's losing
[59:38] control so he says it's been since the
[59:41] beginning that man longs to see the
[59:44] other side but he's been bound in a
[59:46] prison house sometimes tradition of man
[59:49] puts him there that they teach tradition
[59:52] of different forms and motives of How To
[59:55] Worship amen and he puts man under
[59:57] bondage under his tradition and that has
[59:59] been since the world began so it's
[1:00:02] continuing it's a constant thing it's
[1:00:04] been that way and he shut up into prison
[1:00:08] houses amen so it is in the message
[1:00:13] today with such a message that has come
[1:00:16] to set us free we see everything in
[1:00:19] these above scriptures and quotes coming
[1:00:21] to pass amongst us we see people after
[1:00:24] God has br Bren the seals open revealed
[1:00:27] it to us still trying to go back to
[1:00:30] Egypt trying to go back to Pentecost
[1:00:33] trying to go back to denominations when
[1:00:35] the prophet said organized religion why
[1:00:38] I've always been against it I've
[1:00:40] realized it is the mark of the
[1:00:44] beast prise God that's a quote so those
[1:00:48] who form Traditions have more
[1:00:54] children those who live by law have more
[1:00:59] children what does that mean bigger
[1:01:01] churches more people making it personal
[1:01:05] personal more
[1:01:08] evidences more things to be admired more
[1:01:12] things to be recognized like oh all
[1:01:15] right if we're wrong why are there more
[1:01:17] testimonies in our lives if we're wrong
[1:01:20] why are there more miracles in our lives
[1:01:22] why do we have more of the gifts why do
[1:01:25] we have more of of this and more of that
[1:01:27] well
[1:01:28] because the children of the Bond woman
[1:01:31] have more
[1:01:34] evidence but they cannot receive
[1:01:37] Children of the promise amen listen if
[1:01:41] you live by law and tradition you cannot
[1:01:44] bring Children of the
[1:01:45] promise right okay this is just the
[1:01:48] introduction to get to what we want to
[1:01:50] talk about so just stay with me the
[1:01:53] scary thing is that brother brandham
[1:01:55] says
[1:01:56] that the people who live in this
[1:01:59] condition will never make the
[1:02:05] Rapture there's very few things brother
[1:02:08] baram speaks about when he says people
[1:02:11] will never make the Rapture this is
[1:02:13] what's so scary about this if I know
[1:02:16] this I never want to live by traditions
[1:02:18] and laws I want to live by
[1:02:21] Revelation let's read restoration of the
[1:02:24] Bride tree you know the Bible says that
[1:02:27] yes sir Church natural and church
[1:02:30] spiritual and the Bible says cast out
[1:02:33] the bonds woman and her child hagga
[1:02:37] right for she will not that the child is
[1:02:39] hagga but he's he's speaking about who
[1:02:41] the bonds woman is for she will not be
[1:02:43] air with the free woman and her child
[1:02:46] see so the natural church that's going
[1:02:49] to inherit what The Binding of the sheep
[1:02:52] The Binding of the bundles go to be
[1:02:53] burned and she will not inherit or be
[1:02:56] air with the free woman amen if the Bond
[1:02:59] woman is in bondage with her
[1:03:01] organization children she will not be
[1:03:04] air with the free woman because the free
[1:03:06] woman's children is going in Rapture and
[1:03:09] the bonds woman children is going to
[1:03:11] stand in the Judgment see cast
[1:03:15] out oh my so you agree there is a church
[1:03:19] natural and a church
[1:03:21] spiritual brother ROM breaks it down
[1:03:23] further he says that the Bond woman
[1:03:25] Hagar is the church natural and the free
[1:03:29] woman is the bride the church spiritual
[1:03:32] this is actually telling us what it is
[1:03:35] yeah he says later in the same message
[1:03:39] that the children of Bond woman are
[1:03:43] tears listen don't get lost in the
[1:03:46] terminology the children of people or
[1:03:49] the children of belief or a church that
[1:03:52] lives by law are tears they're no not
[1:03:55] the real seed
[1:03:59] right and the children of the free woman
[1:04:01] are the wheat if you go on reading
[1:04:04] restoration of the Bride tree that's
[1:04:05] what he starts saying amen so if the
[1:04:08] carnal Church the children of the carnal
[1:04:11] church are the tears they will go into
[1:04:14] tribulation yes that's right they will
[1:04:17] miss the
[1:04:18] Rapture so only the wheat the spiritual
[1:04:22] Seed of Abraham the children of the free
[1:04:25] woman
[1:04:26] the spiritual church will go in the
[1:04:28] Rapture you love the Lord
[1:04:32] amen uh let's read the next one seed is
[1:04:34] not air with the
[1:04:36] Shar that's why the Rapture is
[1:04:40] different and will only be the Royal
[1:04:42] Seed of Abraham it cannot come by the
[1:04:46] natural carnal seed of the church it'll
[1:04:50] have to be the Royal seed of the word of
[1:04:53] God through Abraham the royal seed
[1:04:56] that's why the Rapture has to be first
[1:04:59] therefore there they will not be HS
[1:05:04] together they'll not be in the Rapture
[1:05:07] together I want to punch this
[1:05:10] through amen the bond shall not be air
[1:05:16] with the free that's right let's settle
[1:05:20] this you cannot serve God by law and
[1:05:25] think you going to go in the Rapture
[1:05:27] amen the carnal church will produce
[1:05:29] Children of the Lord Children of the
[1:05:31] Lord are under the curse children that
[1:05:34] are under the curse cannot go in the
[1:05:36] Rapture they will not inherit the open
[1:05:39] book with uh the children of the free
[1:05:43] amen there is absolutely he says
[1:05:46] continue reading a church natural and a
[1:05:48] church spiritual a church carnal and a
[1:05:51] church spiritual amen are you still with
[1:05:53] me amen so the struggle of the day is
[1:05:57] for the believer to break away from his
[1:06:01] tradition of serving God by caral
[1:06:04] worship and carnal intellectual Faith so
[1:06:07] you know we can we can take this and we
[1:06:10] can if I had an Evangelistic Ministry I
[1:06:12] would stand here and make you all happy
[1:06:14] and Bash the denominations and anyone
[1:06:17] else who doesn't uh accept the open book
[1:06:19] and speak against other mess churches we
[1:06:22] can do that all day and we can all be
[1:06:24] whooping and screaming
[1:06:26] but there's no point if it if it doesn't
[1:06:28] speak to us
[1:06:30] personally amen the believer you must be
[1:06:35] son of the free woman or else you cannot
[1:06:38] be in the Rapture amen you cannot
[1:06:40] inherit the promise this can be
[1:06:42] explained on so many levels which we
[1:06:44] don't want to get to but to understand
[1:06:46] all these things properly we must search
[1:06:49] the scriptures to see the enmity that
[1:06:52] started between the Bond woman and the
[1:06:54] free woman amen amen amen I love my
[1:06:57] Bible amen amen between the son of the
[1:07:00] Bond woman and the son of the free woman
[1:07:02] this
[1:07:03] simple allegory the simple example or
[1:07:08] type in the scripture tells us and
[1:07:10] breaks open a story that goes deep into
[1:07:15] our
[1:07:16] beings amen this type shows us
[1:07:21] accurately of what is happening in our
[1:07:23] day and it shows us what is happening
[1:07:26] presently and what will happen in the
[1:07:28] future according to prophecy what we're
[1:07:31] going to share with you today is exactly
[1:07:33] what is happening in us all nobody's
[1:07:37] free from this because we are
[1:07:40] flesh spirit and soul we have this
[1:07:44] problem amen let's go to seed is not air
[1:07:48] with a
[1:07:49] Shar are you with us amen paragraph 67
[1:07:52] he that is he that do great mystery of
[1:07:56] the the God made
[1:07:58] known understands how that God was in
[1:08:01] Christ reconciling himself to the world
[1:08:03] how that he and the father were
[1:08:06] one right watch this in other words to
[1:08:11] to those of you who know the mystery of
[1:08:14] God to whom the mystery of God is made
[1:08:15] known he understands this right what are
[1:08:17] we understanding how that the great
[1:08:20] Mysteries of the fulfilling of God
[1:08:23] taking and bringing himself
[1:08:25] hisself manifested in the age of human
[1:08:28] beings in the Stream of human beings and
[1:08:32] in the company of human beings to make
[1:08:36] his word manifest in the day in the
[1:08:39] Eastern rising of the Sun and do the
[1:08:42] same thing as the sun sets in the west
[1:08:45] to make hisself manifested in a bright
[1:08:49] Church the word made manifested that
[1:08:53] means if God the mystery of God has been
[1:08:55] known made known to you you know this
[1:08:58] amen
[1:09:00] amen that God brought himself down to be
[1:09:05] in the Stream of human beings and a
[1:09:09] company of human beings from the Eastern
[1:09:12] rising of the Sun to the West
[1:09:15] amen so see it will too he that
[1:09:19] understand it that is to know that's
[1:09:20] been revealed to him to him that sent me
[1:09:23] has everlasting life and will not come
[1:09:25] into the judgment but he's passed from
[1:09:26] Death unto life so that's settled we
[1:09:29] know that God God's purpose was to bring
[1:09:33] himself down into human beings everyone
[1:09:36] with us right now if you know that that
[1:09:40] means if God wants to bring himself down
[1:09:43] into the bride into human beings then
[1:09:46] his
[1:09:47] seed is going to be in US am right and
[1:09:51] if his seed is going to be in us that
[1:09:54] means it's get something to do with that
[1:09:56] which is
[1:09:57] free God's seed is not subject to laws
[1:10:02] God's seed does not have
[1:10:05] transgressions amen it's
[1:10:08] free so this is where it becomes
[1:10:11] personal we have no excuse when we stand
[1:10:14] before the word today we must have the
[1:10:17] revelation of the word for this
[1:10:20] day amen we must see the manifestation
[1:10:23] of the word made flesh in in US in US
[1:10:27] not by the system of law but by the
[1:10:30] operation of Faith okay so you hearing
[1:10:33] me say a lot about that tonight law and
[1:10:35] faith and uh the law does this and this
[1:10:38] transgression let's make it simpler when
[1:10:42] the message was first brought to you it
[1:10:44] was taught to you as
[1:10:48] law as Thou shalt not Thou shalt Thou
[1:10:50] shalt not do not do this do not do that
[1:10:54] so what were what were the initial
[1:10:58] Elders who were bringing the message in
[1:11:00] what were they trying to do they were
[1:11:02] trying to bring some control because we
[1:11:05] came from denominational churches we
[1:11:07] were dressing terribly we didn't know
[1:11:09] how to handle worship we uh had all
[1:11:12] kinds of denominational ideas from where
[1:11:14] we came so
[1:11:15] naturally instead of preaching
[1:11:18] Revelation and allowing us to make
[1:11:20] choices and allowing us to live by
[1:11:23] Revelation they said well it's expedient
[1:11:26] to have
[1:11:28] rules the only problem is they made a
[1:11:31] Revival about the rules that's right
[1:11:34] instead of keeping teaching us that the
[1:11:36] rules is wisdom that you should just
[1:11:39] know but you need to live by Revelation
[1:11:42] amen amen and that's the problem so it
[1:11:47] is not by a system of law but by the
[1:11:49] operation of Faith now if we have the
[1:11:52] operation of Faith then we do not focus
[1:11:55] on people's failings or people's faults
[1:11:59] it becomes personal to you and me it is
[1:12:02] always more about us it's always more
[1:12:05] about me personally Lord about you it's
[1:12:09] always going to be about that all right
[1:12:11] so are you ready for this amen this is
[1:12:14] how it becomes personal your Bond
[1:12:18] woman is your carnal
[1:12:22] nature that's your intellectual faith
[1:12:26] right you just said that God's plan
[1:12:29] God's word God's promise was that he
[1:12:33] would bring himself down in us that's
[1:12:35] right but you started with a Bond woman
[1:12:41] first you started off your life serving
[1:12:44] God with a Bond woman you have to come
[1:12:47] to this and understand and admit this
[1:12:49] you're going to have to come to some
[1:12:50] stage in your life where you stand be
[1:12:53] before God and repent of the life we
[1:12:56] lived that we thought was
[1:13:00] righteous repent does not mean apologize
[1:13:03] it means to have a change of mind
[1:13:07] amen so if the your born woman is your
[1:13:12] carnal nature your intellectual Faith
[1:13:16] then that has a son that means it
[1:13:20] produces a certain
[1:13:22] life right and your son of the Bond
[1:13:26] woman is your carnal
[1:13:29] worship listen it's not it's not doing
[1:13:32] bad things it's your interpretation of
[1:13:35] submission to God yeah that's Ishmael
[1:13:40] amen you're you're not trying to do evil
[1:13:42] things you're trying to worship God by
[1:13:45] an intellectual Faith by carnality
[1:13:49] you're trying to serve God but that's
[1:13:51] ishma that's your ishma and often times
[1:13:55] we have arguments because it's our
[1:13:57] ishmael's arguing with each
[1:14:01] other because our Isaac's would never
[1:14:03] argue with each other yeah that was in
[1:14:05] his mind before the foundation of the
[1:14:07] world yeah if we could just get those
[1:14:10] Ishmael out the
[1:14:11] way carnal worship to God that brings a
[1:14:16] life of
[1:14:17] condemnation that's a part that brings
[1:14:19] you to church and makes you feel
[1:14:23] unworthy right Isaac is not going to
[1:14:25] walk around feeling
[1:14:26] unworthy am Isaac knows who he is as Son
[1:14:29] Of
[1:14:30] Promise Isaac has been to mount Mariah
[1:14:33] and knows he's a Son of God he does not
[1:14:36] feel ashamed he does not feel like a
[1:14:38] transgressor he does not feel like
[1:14:40] lesser than anyone else but ishma has a
[1:14:45] complex ishma even feels like I had the
[1:14:48] circumcision
[1:14:49] first before you
[1:14:53] amen your caral wor worship came before
[1:14:56] your worship of
[1:14:58] Revelation you were living with that guy
[1:15:00] for a long time he is the older brother
[1:15:05] amen so our free woman is the divine
[1:15:08] nature what is the divine nature the
[1:15:11] genan seed that feminine attribute of
[1:15:15] Christ that was living dormant in them
[1:15:17] for a long time that feminine attribute
[1:15:20] of Christ was Barren was not producing
[1:15:24] when you wanted it to produce you wanted
[1:15:26] it to produce the life it wasn't
[1:15:28] producing you're waiting on God but when
[1:15:30] Lord when are you going to reveal the
[1:15:32] seals to me when are you going to reveal
[1:15:33] the word to me when is this thunder ever
[1:15:35] going to make sense when is this going
[1:15:38] to come right when is the word going to
[1:15:39] reveal itself when can I have this
[1:15:41] personal relationship in the meantime
[1:15:43] let's be a good churchgoer let's be a
[1:15:45] good message believer let's try and keep
[1:15:47] the rules let's keep the rules let's
[1:15:48] keep the rules I'm telling myself I'm a
[1:15:50] good guy cuz I'm keeping the rules I'm
[1:15:53] doing well amen God told Cain if you do
[1:15:57] well and if you don't do
[1:16:00] well he doesn't say that to
[1:16:05] Sons you know if you look at sons in the
[1:16:08] Bible man those guys messed up so many
[1:16:11] times it's like there stories David a
[1:16:14] man after my own heart had the most
[1:16:16] dysfunctional
[1:16:17] family right of anyone else I mean look
[1:16:21] those kids were even killing themselves
[1:16:27] divine nature the genan seed are pure
[1:16:31] Revelation under the third pool thank
[1:16:33] you Lord that's our free woman amen and
[1:16:37] nobody wants to preach about that
[1:16:39] everybody wants to talk about the Bond
[1:16:41] woman they don't realize by trying to go
[1:16:44] back to Pentecost you're trying to
[1:16:45] resurrect the Bond woman and her
[1:16:49] son so the Divine Nature has to produce
[1:16:53] a son at the time of life in the Silence
[1:16:57] of the seven seal without
[1:17:00] Sensations by the coming of the Lord
[1:17:02] Genesis 21 right in the plains of memory
[1:17:06] amen the son of the free woman is
[1:17:09] conceived and Christ is Manifest in our
[1:17:12] flesh the word becoming visible our life
[1:17:17] of Freedom not life of
[1:17:20] condemnation you will only live a life
[1:17:22] of Freedom once that gen brings forth
[1:17:26] other than that whatever kind of church
[1:17:29] carnality you are living by is going to
[1:17:31] constantly put you in transgression and
[1:17:34] condemnation and if you keep living your
[1:17:37] life that way you will be bluffing
[1:17:41] yourself because the bond shall not be
[1:17:44] air with the
[1:17:45] free not even
[1:17:47] close so you agree there is a battle and
[1:17:51] a trial we are facing every day I feel
[1:17:55] it every
[1:17:55] day I can't tell you how many times that
[1:17:59] nervy nature that anxiety it's like I
[1:18:03] really want to kick it out but it's
[1:18:05] constantly coming up and raising its
[1:18:07] evil head I I know who I am I feel it
[1:18:11] when I pray I'm so energized and the
[1:18:13] moment I get amongst people I'm trapped
[1:18:16] again I'm walking around feeling like
[1:18:18] everyone's watching
[1:18:20] me right I just don't want to feel like
[1:18:23] that anymore and so there's this battle
[1:18:26] this trial that we must face to bring
[1:18:28] the word to manifest in our flesh and
[1:18:31] this battle is revealed in the types and
[1:18:34] shadows people who don't have a free
[1:18:36] woman don't have any trouble with this I
[1:18:39] wonder I see some of these fellas you
[1:18:42] know preaching and get on the internet
[1:18:44] and in their churches they're walking up
[1:18:46] and down and shouting it out and they
[1:18:49] can say wrong things nobody says
[1:18:51] anything they can say the most terrible
[1:18:54] things they walk out chest out you know
[1:18:57] the churches do stuff they don't even
[1:18:59] seem to have any striving
[1:19:01] inside they don't they just believe
[1:19:03] they're receiving all the blessings they
[1:19:05] claim it they walk around and you and I
[1:19:08] who are eating from the open book are
[1:19:10] the ones feeling like everyone's
[1:19:11] watching
[1:19:12] us like like we're trapped like we're
[1:19:15] feeling like like uh uh we don't have
[1:19:18] what these people have we you know we
[1:19:20] wish we could have more right and those
[1:19:23] who don't have a fre woman just don't
[1:19:26] care they don't have a struggle just
[1:19:29] walk around believing they're
[1:19:32] it there's no struggle within amen let's
[1:19:36] go to Genesis 16: 1-6 and this is the
[1:19:40] beginning of the Bond woman and the free
[1:19:42] woman let's have a look at this
[1:19:44] type now Sarah Abram's wife bear him no
[1:19:50] children and she had an
[1:19:52] handmade an egyp Ian whose name was
[1:19:57] hagga I want you to notice this this
[1:19:59] handmade is an Egyptian this is very
[1:20:03] important because we want to understand
[1:20:05] from the quotes or from the scriptures
[1:20:07] from the types what's happening with us
[1:20:10] so hegar is an
[1:20:12] Egyptian and Sarah said unto Abraham
[1:20:15] behold now the Lord hath restrained me
[1:20:17] from bearing in other words I'm Barren
[1:20:20] uh I pray thee go in unto my maid it may
[1:20:23] be that I may children by her because
[1:20:26] that was a law at that time because a
[1:20:29] servant belongs to the master in this
[1:20:32] case the
[1:20:33] mistress who is the female master and uh
[1:20:37] uh everything that she has belongs to uh
[1:20:40] belongs to her whatever child that hagga
[1:20:43] would have belongs to Sarah that was the
[1:20:46] law of Master and slave the the child or
[1:20:49] and the the bondmaid and her child have
[1:20:51] no rights that was the law of slavery at
[1:20:54] that that time right so uh she says why
[1:20:58] don't you go into my handmaid and
[1:21:00] produce a child through the because look
[1:21:01] at time is going I'm getting old I can't
[1:21:03] have a baby and maybe God was talking
[1:21:06] about this we could use that law to
[1:21:08] bring in a
[1:21:11] son it may be that I may obtain children
[1:21:14] by her it may be see interpretation and
[1:21:18] Abraham hearkened to the voice of Sarah
[1:21:22] and Sarah Abraham's wife took Hagar her
[1:21:26] made the
[1:21:28] Egyptian after Abram had dwelt 10 years
[1:21:31] in the land of Canaan and gave her to
[1:21:33] her husband Abram to be his wife by that
[1:21:37] mean his wife meaning that he might have
[1:21:40] children through her not that they were
[1:21:43] married you
[1:21:46] understand and he went in unto hagga in
[1:21:49] other words she made it
[1:21:52] legal breaking the story out she must
[1:21:54] must have made it known to the people
[1:21:56] outside obviously you're not going to
[1:21:57] keep the secret you want to explain to
[1:21:59] the other servants you want to explain
[1:22:00] to everybody else that this is something
[1:22:02] that Sarah condoned Abram's not doing
[1:22:05] this illegally or by his own uh um
[1:22:09] valtion he's doing it because Sarah has
[1:22:12] okayed it got it okay and he went in to
[1:22:16] hagga and she conceived and when she saw
[1:22:18] that she had conceived her mistress was
[1:22:22] despised in her eyes
[1:22:26] amen so in other words when the Bond
[1:22:29] woman sees that she has a child she now
[1:22:33] starts despising the free
[1:22:35] woman very
[1:22:38] important and Sarah said unto Abraham my
[1:22:42] wrong be upon thee that means I have
[1:22:45] caused this to happen to you Sarah is
[1:22:47] confessing now because she's seeing this
[1:22:50] despising uh look in the eye of the Bond
[1:22:53] woman and when saw that she had uh I
[1:22:56] have given my maid unto thy bosom and
[1:22:58] when she saw that she had conceived I
[1:23:01] was despised In Her Eyes the lord judge
[1:23:04] between me and thee but Abraham said
[1:23:06] unto Sarah Behold thy maid is in thy
[1:23:11] hand do to her as it pleaseth thee and
[1:23:14] when Sarah dealt hardly with her she
[1:23:18] fled from her
[1:23:20] face all right notice what happens after
[1:23:24] this long period of barrenness of the
[1:23:27] spiritual nature now we're bringing it
[1:23:28] to you uh the spiritual system leans
[1:23:32] towards a natural system lord it's been
[1:23:35] 50 60 years in the message you know
[1:23:39] we're still struggling with the the
[1:23:42] Cod where the rules with the dos and the
[1:23:45] don'ts like the church is things are not
[1:23:47] improving like what's happening you know
[1:23:49] and the seals are open we're getting
[1:23:52] into the word we're looking at the
[1:23:53] revealing of the word and and and still
[1:23:55] you know what's the problem the church
[1:23:57] is still cold and things don't you know
[1:23:59] we've got to go back let's have another
[1:24:01] Holy Ghost meeting let's have prayer
[1:24:04] nights let's have some program that goes
[1:24:07] on what are we trying to do this is
[1:24:10] Sarah saying I'm
[1:24:12] impatient why not try through the Bond
[1:24:17] woman and then it
[1:24:19] happens and then we say what have we
[1:24:22] done
[1:24:25] my sin my wrong be upon thee right and
[1:24:31] you know when the natural produced it
[1:24:33] was increased in Pride and this is what
[1:24:36] happens can you see why it's
[1:24:38] despised you know
[1:24:40] what you just try getting behind this
[1:24:43] desk and see what a struggle it is to
[1:24:46] hold Pride
[1:24:48] down you you don't even want to be here
[1:24:52] because it's literally a Razor's Edge
[1:24:54] and I was telling brother Chad when we
[1:24:56] were coming to the service today I
[1:24:58] actually don't like preaching I prefer
[1:25:01] where you know like the book of Acts
[1:25:02] where we all sit around a table and we
[1:25:04] just share the word I'd love that but
[1:25:07] once we get to this place where the
[1:25:09] lights are on you your miked up there's
[1:25:12] people all watching you suddenly it
[1:25:14] looks like you need to produce a show
[1:25:17] right and I'm so aware of that because I
[1:25:20] want to I want to try not to be
[1:25:23] convincing You by char Prisma I want to
[1:25:25] share exactly what's in in God's what
[1:25:28] God has revealed in my heart and bring
[1:25:30] the thought without trying to be
[1:25:32] charismatically convincing because I
[1:25:35] know the danger of that that's right and
[1:25:37] yet I feel myself slipping away
[1:25:40] sometimes sometimes I'm getting excited
[1:25:41] and I want to shout and scream and and
[1:25:44] you know and then I got to rein myself
[1:25:46] in but I think that's the Holy Spirit
[1:25:48] trying to do that right so when the
[1:25:52] natural produces it increases it
[1:25:56] increases in Pride and the value of the
[1:25:59] spiritual becomes
[1:26:00] lessened what I'm telling you
[1:26:03] is if you if God gives you a gift of
[1:26:06] Prophecy or a gift of dreams and God
[1:26:09] starts showing you something do you
[1:26:11] really think you're suddenly going to or
[1:26:14] you're just going to remain your humble
[1:26:16] self do you think there's not going to
[1:26:19] be something coming up inside that where
[1:26:21] a little pride is and you start to feel
[1:26:22] a little bit more important
[1:26:26] do you really think you can just reain
[1:26:28] that
[1:26:30] in in our church you know especially and
[1:26:33] we do this with the brothers we handle
[1:26:35] it through the deacons we handle we will
[1:26:36] handle it through the through the pastor
[1:26:39] but if it's a sister who uh I'm just
[1:26:41] sharing you with why we are so careful
[1:26:44] with it if the sister has a gift of
[1:26:46] either speaking tongues or prophesy or
[1:26:49] whatever it is if it's a sister I will
[1:26:51] say to them and they know very well you
[1:26:53] run it through your husband first don't
[1:26:55] feel the Liberty to come and speak to me
[1:26:57] go through your husband first let him
[1:26:59] come and speak to me and explain to it
[1:27:01] do you know why I'm doing this because a
[1:27:03] gift needs
[1:27:05] headship I'm doing this for you to
[1:27:07] prevent you from stepping across into
[1:27:09] Pride because you run it through your
[1:27:12] husband first let him be the one to
[1:27:13] share with me brother Al this is what my
[1:27:16] wife has seen this is the dream this is
[1:27:17] the whatever it is and if you're happy
[1:27:20] with that this is going to keep that
[1:27:23] natural thing in in
[1:27:25] check because otherwise you'll start
[1:27:27] undermining your husband you'll start
[1:27:30] dominating him he'll feel like well God
[1:27:33] is showing her things and not me he's
[1:27:36] going to start doing weird things too
[1:27:38] like trying to make himself more
[1:27:41] valuable than you or be more spiritual
[1:27:43] and it's going to be tough for
[1:27:46] him and that's the same thing that
[1:27:48] happens in a church when that's that
[1:27:51] starts rising up in the flesh and the
[1:27:54] important starts coming up and it
[1:27:57] happens if you have a gift of preaching
[1:27:59] or a gift of expounding the word or you
[1:28:01] think you just know a little bit more
[1:28:02] than other people or you can see a
[1:28:04] little bit more than other people maybe
[1:28:07] in the promised land you just have a
[1:28:08] house that's in a mountain while someone
[1:28:10] else is in the plane it doesn't make any
[1:28:13] difference
[1:28:15] right but this is what the natural does
[1:28:17] to us it puts a little Spirit of pride
[1:28:22] inside and we got to understand that is
[1:28:26] natural amen that does not inherit the
[1:28:29] promises we've got to keep it in check
[1:28:32] so Sarah realizes the problem and
[1:28:35] complained to Abraham so it's like Lord
[1:28:38] how do we deal with this now I love
[1:28:41] Abraham's words uh the Bond woman is
[1:28:44] your
[1:28:45] slave you deal with it I'm not touching
[1:28:49] this are are we together you know how
[1:28:51] much I draw from this the Bor woman is
[1:28:55] the slave of the free woman why are you
[1:28:58] allowing her to affect
[1:29:02] you you deal with
[1:29:04] it amen do with her as you please in
[1:29:07] other words Abram is saying I don't care
[1:29:10] I don't care what you do with her it's
[1:29:11] your slave you deal with it what is this
[1:29:15] saying this is saying that the genan
[1:29:17] seed needs to take dominion over the
[1:29:22] Bond woman the seed the feminine
[1:29:25] attribute within your soul needs to take
[1:29:28] dominance over that Bond woman amen even
[1:29:31] if the Bond woman um produce a child
[1:29:34] first at some stage in your life that
[1:29:37] feminine attribute will start bringing
[1:29:39] forward something that overcomes that
[1:29:41] puts it under submission
[1:29:43] amen we have to realize that the natural
[1:29:47] is the servant to the spiritual not the
[1:29:49] other way around so our trial for each
[1:29:52] one of us is to to strengthen our
[1:29:55] spiritual against this carnal flesh it
[1:29:58] which it leans towards law right it's
[1:30:02] always going to lean towards
[1:30:03] law you know I love it when actually I
[1:30:07] don't I'm being
[1:30:08] sarcastic when people come and ask you
[1:30:11] you know uh we want to do this you know
[1:30:15] what what must we do uh what does what
[1:30:18] what what is right in the message for us
[1:30:21] to do and I just ask what do you want to
[1:30:23] do
[1:30:24] exactly tell me what you want to do
[1:30:27] because your intentions are
[1:30:29] important don't look for something to
[1:30:32] make it convenient for for you to do
[1:30:34] that yeah amen what does your heart tell
[1:30:38] you what do the Gen see tell
[1:30:41] you amen that's what you need to be
[1:30:44] living after not finding quotes or
[1:30:47] scriptures to make things
[1:30:48] convenient because we want the spiritual
[1:30:51] to be dominant
[1:30:54] to to be in the
[1:30:56] dominion over the natural we have to
[1:30:59] admit we have lived so long with the
[1:31:01] natural being
[1:31:03] dominant and that's what we're dealing
[1:31:05] that's why you still need to come to
[1:31:07] church if you could do this by yourself
[1:31:10] you wouldn't need to come to church you
[1:31:12] wouldn't need a pastor you wouldn't need
[1:31:14] the church that God has provided for you
[1:31:16] the fact that we are still here is that
[1:31:18] we need to do this amen let's go to
[1:31:23] genes Genesis 16:15-16 you love him
[1:31:25] Saints amen and so this was happening
[1:31:29] just when hega was pregnant right she
[1:31:33] the moment she was pregnant she was
[1:31:34] already despising the Jean seed now she
[1:31:38] Bears the Sun and hegab uh bear Abraham
[1:31:41] a son and Abraham called his son's name
[1:31:44] which hegab bear Ishmael and Abraham was
[1:31:48] four score and six years old when Hagar
[1:31:51] bear Ishmael to Abraham so
[1:31:54] all the trouble Israel would ever have
[1:31:57] in future starts here with the simple
[1:32:02] story that's right right Hagar is an
[1:32:06] Egyptian Hagar types Egypt Ishmael
[1:32:10] became the leader of Abraham's children
[1:32:12] through
[1:32:13] Cura he is known in scripture as the
[1:32:16] midianites or the ishmaelites that's
[1:32:19] right right amen and Ishmael was the
[1:32:22] father of the Arabian people and the
[1:32:24] leader of the
[1:32:26] midianites from now on Egypt and Ishmael
[1:32:31] are going to be a Scourge to the free
[1:32:33] woman right and her son right that's
[1:32:36] what the tipes tell us so the children
[1:32:38] of Israel were forever having trouble
[1:32:40] with these two Nations Egyptians and
[1:32:43] midianites God hated the children of
[1:32:45] Midian even though he had to bless them
[1:32:48] because he made a promise to Abraham I
[1:32:49] will multiply your seed yeah and Lord
[1:32:52] knows they're multiplying
[1:32:55] constantly and because Abraham uh he
[1:32:58] said to him I will bless his your
[1:33:00] children but there was the son of
[1:33:02] Promise who is Isaac who's also being
[1:33:04] blessed but all Abraham's children are
[1:33:07] being blessed according to the promise
[1:33:10] but later on the Lord hated the
[1:33:12] midianites because they were baale
[1:33:15] worshippers and they were always trying
[1:33:18] to corrupt the children of
[1:33:20] Isaac the children of Israel and no
[1:33:23] matter how much Israel tried somehow
[1:33:26] they always had the worst situations
[1:33:29] with these two Nations the Bond woman
[1:33:31] Egypt and her son the
[1:33:34] midianites yeah amen amen why are we why
[1:33:37] are we telling you this because we're
[1:33:39] telling you we're actually telling you
[1:33:41] the Bible is warning you that you are
[1:33:45] constantly going to have problems with
[1:33:48] Egypt and
[1:33:50] Midian we know it it told us
[1:33:54] amen so it's it's not a difficult thing
[1:33:57] when you come to us with a carnal
[1:34:00] problem we know who's speaking to
[1:34:03] us Egypt or
[1:34:05] Midian but when you come to us with the
[1:34:07] gene
[1:34:08] seed that's
[1:34:11] evident amen God and forget about coming
[1:34:14] to us I mean who are we when you look in
[1:34:16] the mirror every day when you approach
[1:34:19] life every day when you do things before
[1:34:21] God when you worship God you will know
[1:34:23] know when it's carnal and when it's
[1:34:25] spiritual that's right amen so I'm going
[1:34:27] to show you just going to go through the
[1:34:29] types before we bring this to a
[1:34:32] conclusion I want to show you the
[1:34:34] problems that occurred in the Bible that
[1:34:36] had to do with these two groups Egypt
[1:34:38] and Midian let's go to uh
[1:34:42] Esau Genesis 28:
[1:34:46] 8-9 and Esau seeing the daughters of
[1:34:48] Canaan pleased not Isaac's father in
[1:34:51] other words and Esau knowth
[1:34:54] that the daughters of Canaan did not
[1:34:56] make his father happy he's deliberately
[1:34:59] going to make his father
[1:35:01] unhappy then went Esau unto
[1:35:06] Ishmael and took unto the wives which he
[1:35:09] had mahalah the daughter of Ishmael
[1:35:12] Abraham's son the sister of Nebo to be
[1:35:15] his
[1:35:17] wife literally wanting to make his
[1:35:20] father unhappy goes to Ishmael to find a
[1:35:23] wife
[1:35:24] yes you know how much a problem this
[1:35:26] caused this produced The
[1:35:29] Who are constant scourged to
[1:35:32] Israel as if Egypt and Israel wasn't
[1:35:34] enough now you form the which
[1:35:36] are more of that they're just growing
[1:35:39] are you seeing the
[1:35:41] children of the carnal as producing much
[1:35:44] more children than those who are of the
[1:35:47] promise and so Esau produced
[1:35:51] which means they were part ishmaelites
[1:35:54] and this was displeasing to Isaac his
[1:35:56] father and
[1:35:58] God God could even say because he knew
[1:36:01] Esau was going to do this that Jacob
[1:36:03] have I loved and Esau have I hated yes
[1:36:05] right
[1:36:06] amen all right this is beautiful and
[1:36:09] this is amazing the story of Joseph who
[1:36:12] is Joseph Christ
[1:36:15] Christ The Promised word the promised
[1:36:18] son the one who wears the coat of the
[1:36:20] father right the coat of seven colors
[1:36:23] and his brothers hate him is that right
[1:36:26] and they conspire to get rid of him they
[1:36:28] throw him in a pit three days type of
[1:36:32] Calvary right amen then Judah sees Who
[1:36:35] coming that's right amen the
[1:36:39] ishmaelites the midianites amen and the
[1:36:43] midianites take him
[1:36:44] where to
[1:36:47] Egypt they sell the promised seed to the
[1:36:50] son of the Bond woman and the son of the
[1:36:52] Bond woman takes him to the born woman
[1:36:55] and makes him a
[1:36:57] slave this is literally a type telling
[1:37:00] you that the promised seed is going to
[1:37:02] be taken slave by the carnal
[1:37:05] nature but the the type also shows you
[1:37:07] that Joseph is going to come out of
[1:37:08] there and take Dominion is that right so
[1:37:12] in other words the predestinated one is
[1:37:15] placed under subjection of that which is
[1:37:18] meant to be a slave Egypt is a slave
[1:37:21] Ishmael is the son of a slave he's
[1:37:23] supposed to be in charge of them but
[1:37:26] this system brings Joseph and throws him
[1:37:29] in
[1:37:31] prison he's made a slave to a rightful
[1:37:35] slave
[1:37:38] yeah I I don't want to keep typing this
[1:37:40] to you I hope you're catching it yes sir
[1:37:43] right that means for a very long time
[1:37:45] Eugene seed is being made slave to the
[1:37:49] carnality right it's there in the types
[1:37:52] Joseph now has to fight his way out
[1:37:55] because they keep trying to make him an
[1:37:59] Egyptian they eventually dress him as an
[1:38:02] Egyptian praise the Lord are you seeing
[1:38:06] yourself they put upon Him Egyptian
[1:38:08] clothing they give him Egyptian way of
[1:38:11] life pfar pfa's wife even tries to claim
[1:38:18] him and he's going to escape he's going
[1:38:20] to run this is what is been going on in
[1:38:23] side of you for so
[1:38:25] long eventually when Israel comes to
[1:38:28] Egypt Joseph says please don't leave my
[1:38:31] remains here get me out of here remember
[1:38:35] when you leave this place do not let
[1:38:37] them bury me in this place take me to
[1:38:39] the land of promise amen prise God
[1:38:44] beautiful am let's look at Moses right
[1:38:48] so Israel become slaves to Egypt here is
[1:38:52] Isaac enslaved saved by
[1:38:55] hagga and the Bible says that Moses had
[1:38:58] an identity
[1:39:00] crisis like someone made him the son of
[1:39:03] the Bond woman that's right yeah he went
[1:39:06] floating down the river because the true
[1:39:08] Sons were in danger and he was taken in
[1:39:11] by a kind Bond
[1:39:13] woman and placed on the throne of the
[1:39:17] born
[1:39:18] people they should be slaves but they're
[1:39:20] ruling the world the mightiest Empire at
[1:39:23] the time yeah and he was brought up as
[1:39:26] an Egyptian the promised son the one who
[1:39:30] is the
[1:39:31] deliverer has been brought up having an
[1:39:35] Egyptian identity that's
[1:39:40] right
[1:39:42] yes this is what happened in the church
[1:39:45] ages we were not supposed to be ruled by
[1:39:47] Rome yeah this beautiful word of God
[1:39:51] came through Christ and the Apostles and
[1:39:54] was coming to set us free and then they
[1:39:56] took us right into to NAA and then the
[1:40:00] Christianity was hijacked by this Roman
[1:40:03] system who should have been they're the
[1:40:05] the the ruling power at the time and
[1:40:07] they they are the ones who took uh
[1:40:10] occasion and took the word of God and
[1:40:12] Enslaved the truth amen Enslaved the the
[1:40:16] the the righteous way of living they
[1:40:18] enslaved Revelation do you know um in
[1:40:21] the Dark Ages just just prior to that
[1:40:24] when Rome took over they banned
[1:40:26] preaching by types and
[1:40:28] shadows do you know that they literally
[1:40:30] banned preaching by types and shadows
[1:40:33] because some of the the Jewish um
[1:40:35] Believers were were preaching about
[1:40:37] Jonah and they were typing and they said
[1:40:38] it's too uh erratic and it's it's uh
[1:40:43] unreliable so we should not teach by
[1:40:45] types and shadows literally go and have
[1:40:48] a look at what they they teach in their
[1:40:50] uh Bible schools and yet brother bam
[1:40:52] comes out in the end and said I'm a
[1:40:55] [Applause]
[1:40:57] typologist
[1:40:59] right Moses trapped given an Egyptian
[1:41:03] identity what is happening to you what
[1:41:05] is happening to us amen this is where we
[1:41:08] come through we're sitting here in a
[1:41:09] Christian Church everything this format
[1:41:12] was created by
[1:41:16] churchianity it was created by Christian
[1:41:19] religion all that we do is created by
[1:41:21] Christian we're actually trying to
[1:41:23] to be the free son in systems created by
[1:41:31] Egypt look at the things we have to talk
[1:41:33] about what kind of music is right how
[1:41:36] must the prayer be you know uh should
[1:41:40] Church ought to be handled this way and
[1:41:42] uh uh should we dressed that way and how
[1:41:46] should we speak and our language and our
[1:41:48] marriages and how to bring up children
[1:41:51] and what Sunday school should be like
[1:41:52] and who who created all that
[1:41:55] amen we still have to go through
[1:41:58] it can you come up with any other
[1:42:04] system even the prophet did it brother
[1:42:06] maram literally brought Pentecost he
[1:42:09] said I as much as said I don't exactly
[1:42:11] agree with Pentecost but they're the
[1:42:13] closest you know
[1:42:15] that but I mean can't we come up with a
[1:42:18] better system or better way no because
[1:42:22] the free does not need
[1:42:25] systems right amen and that's why it's
[1:42:28] some this is is the reason why the
[1:42:30] prophet said I no longer call you church
[1:42:33] I call you bride so you will
[1:42:37] understand so even though we're in this
[1:42:41] I'll say it plainly church is an
[1:42:43] Egyptian system it's a Roman system
[1:42:46] everything we do and so please don't get
[1:42:50] picky about things that Egypt put on us
[1:42:54] yeah we need to move forward with the
[1:42:57] word with that which was before the
[1:42:59] world began the word of Christ that went
[1:43:03] into dingy halls and poor places and
[1:43:06] places where there was no order like
[1:43:08] Roman
[1:43:10] Theology and places where Believers were
[1:43:12] free to share what is in their heart and
[1:43:14] to live according to Revelation that's
[1:43:17] where we ought to be
[1:43:20] today Hebrews 11:24 isn't isn't this
[1:43:23] wonderful amen look at what Moses does
[1:43:26] by faith Moses when he became
[1:43:30] mature refused to be called the son of
[1:43:32] Pharaoh's
[1:43:34] Daughter by faith he refused the
[1:43:36] Egyptian
[1:43:38] identity of all things to mention I mean
[1:43:41] you could have mentioned a whole lot of
[1:43:42] other things that Moses had Faith about
[1:43:44] but this is what he his faith produced
[1:43:47] he refused his Egyptian identity he was
[1:43:50] grown up an Egyptian he was taught
[1:43:53] Egyptian Warfare he was taught Egyptian
[1:43:55] law he was placed on the throne he was
[1:43:58] wearing Egyptian clothing but when he
[1:44:00] became
[1:44:01] mature amen he forsook Egyptian identity
[1:44:06] that's where the bride of Christ ought
[1:44:08] to get
[1:44:09] to forsake Egyptian identity because
[1:44:13] that is the son of the carnal nature
[1:44:16] that is the worship of carnality we have
[1:44:19] to come to a place where the bride is
[1:44:21] dominant the Gen is dominant and the
[1:44:24] worship that comes from us is the son of
[1:44:26] that which should be dominant the son of
[1:44:29] the genan seed praise be to God and in
[1:44:33] coming to maturity he refuses to be
[1:44:35] called the son of the Bond woman though
[1:44:37] being a slave to the Bond woman he had
[1:44:40] to I love that story I love the story of
[1:44:42] Moses how he was tussling with he was
[1:44:45] shown who he is you're the son of Hebrew
[1:44:47] slaves can you imagine a
[1:44:50] turmoil I have to forsake a
[1:44:53] palace for a slave house I've got to
[1:44:57] forsake good clothes a nice
[1:45:00] bath a good
[1:45:04] job people that respect me and come to a
[1:45:08] place where I even save this guy from
[1:45:10] another Egyptian and and he says who
[1:45:11] made you a prince over
[1:45:13] us you mean I'm going to give up this
[1:45:15] for that yes amen there's far more
[1:45:18] recognition if we go back to Pentecost
[1:45:20] isn't it there's far more recognition if
[1:45:23] I can keep the law better than someone
[1:45:25] else isn't it oh yeah if I can have a
[1:45:28] gift like those guys if I can have more
[1:45:31] recognition more or better pulpits or
[1:45:34] more people uh lording my name or more
[1:45:37] people shouting about respecting me
[1:45:40] that's that's a lot better than this
[1:45:44] humility what's with this
[1:45:48] humility so when he kills an Egyptian it
[1:45:52] was Sy
[1:45:53] because after that he
[1:45:55] escapes right and he escapes the Bond
[1:45:58] woman praise be to God
[1:46:01] hallelujah and then where does he land
[1:46:07] first now when Pharaoh heard this thing
[1:46:09] he sought to slay Moses but Moses fled
[1:46:12] from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in
[1:46:14] the land of Midian and he sat down by a
[1:46:18] well out of the pot into the
[1:46:20] fire it's like you just kind of escape
[1:46:23] this thing he will leave the Bond woman
[1:46:26] and go and find the bond woman's son
[1:46:29] right merrily in the desert surrounding
[1:46:32] the Holy
[1:46:33] Mountain that's right amen unbelievable
[1:46:37] amen so he settled down and forgot his
[1:46:41] purpose there's a quote in the message
[1:46:43] where the Prophet said God searching for
[1:46:47] Moses dramatizing it and he says he
[1:46:49] found him merrily walking around the
[1:46:52] mountain
[1:46:53] with his little wife and his children
[1:46:57] and his
[1:46:58] sheep living at ease brother B says God
[1:47:02] found him in this
[1:47:05] condition that doesn't sound like a bad
[1:47:07] condition that sounds like good family
[1:47:10] life you know wife his little children
[1:47:13] pretty little wife around the mountain
[1:47:15] of God he's got a
[1:47:18] job and brother Ram said God found him
[1:47:21] in this condition
[1:47:23] yes living amongst the bond woman's
[1:47:27] son right and he married the daughter of
[1:47:30] a priest of Midian that's
[1:47:33] right you see how fast we get
[1:47:37] trapped we just Escape Pentecost we come
[1:47:40] off and we go straight to the son of the
[1:47:41] born
[1:47:42] woman and he goes back to Egypt now he
[1:47:46] he meets God he's been hanging around
[1:47:48] the mountain 40 years living his life of
[1:47:51] ease and then God
[1:47:53] has to bring a pillar of fire to get his
[1:47:55] attention and then he questions God have
[1:47:57] you not heard the cries of my
[1:48:02] people and you know what he does because
[1:48:04] this is what happens to uh traditional
[1:48:07] Believers he goes to Egypt he saves his
[1:48:10] people and where does he bring
[1:48:12] them back to Jethro his
[1:48:16] father-in-law right and that was his
[1:48:18] first major mistake because Jethro
[1:48:21] taught him denominationalism
[1:48:25] what do you remember Jethro tells him
[1:48:27] you know what uh as a priest of Midian
[1:48:30] as someone very well versed in the law
[1:48:33] as someone who studied for a long time
[1:48:36] and has a degree in this I can tell you
[1:48:39] that you are taking too much on yourself
[1:48:41] it looks a little smacks of
[1:48:43] self-importance you know I know you've
[1:48:46] had some some powerful first and second
[1:48:49] po Ministries but you know this is not
[1:48:51] the way to go you need to elect 70
[1:48:55] men you know who can handle things for
[1:48:57] you need to create a system whereby you
[1:49:00] can control the
[1:49:02] people that's what the son of the Bond
[1:49:04] woman
[1:49:07] teaches it was denominational advice and
[1:49:09] that just LED Moses to more trouble
[1:49:12] because once he gave these other men
[1:49:14] importance he started circumventing what
[1:49:17] he was supposed to do and he realized he
[1:49:19] and his people had to leave Midian he
[1:49:22] had to separate from his
[1:49:24] father-in-law and move them to the
[1:49:27] promised land because they were sitting
[1:49:28] around there enjoying this and they were
[1:49:32] not getting to the promise amen glory to
[1:49:35] God all right so the midianites when
[1:49:38] they walked through the Wilderness uh
[1:49:42] God forbad them to marry the midianites
[1:49:45] is that
[1:49:46] right so when the children of Israel
[1:49:49] committed whoredoms with Moab God killed
[1:49:52] 24 4,000 yes Israelites by a plague
[1:49:57] right and the high priest's son finaz
[1:50:00] saw an Israelite who took a Midian itish
[1:50:03] woman into his tent to take to wife and
[1:50:07] finaz went in and thrust them both with
[1:50:09] a javelin and God stopped the
[1:50:13] curse God was happy that they killed a
[1:50:17] midan itish woman and sto this marriage
[1:50:20] between Israel and Midian
[1:50:23] yeah God stopped the curse God was
[1:50:25] pleased because of that and stopped the
[1:50:29] curse why it's it's just On and On
[1:50:32] Through the Bible right let's go to C is
[1:50:35] not air with the Shar paragraph 72 you
[1:50:37] love the Lord Saints
[1:50:40] amen the stalk hagga two wives doubted
[1:50:45] the promise but watch what that brought
[1:50:48] forth when hagga the second wife of
[1:50:51] Abram which was just an ABS absolutely a
[1:50:54] concubine wife I like the fact that
[1:50:56] brother maram makes that
[1:50:58] clear but she brought forth a man but
[1:51:02] what kind of man was he the Bible said
[1:51:05] he was a wild man yes sir he lived by
[1:51:09] his bow and no man would conquer him he
[1:51:12] was untameable unconvertible
[1:51:18] unregenerated amen you want to go back
[1:51:21] to that
[1:51:23] the prophet said a wild man ishmail is a
[1:51:25] wild man the the worship that you will
[1:51:28] produce from a carnal nature is a wild
[1:51:30] man he's untameable unconvertible
[1:51:37] unregenerated do not get trapped in them
[1:51:40] saying they can take you back to that he
[1:51:43] could not be tamed he was a wild man
[1:51:45] because he was of the contrary to God's
[1:51:47] word and anything that's contrary listen
[1:51:50] any preacher any member any church
[1:51:54] that's contrary to God's word will bring
[1:51:56] forth a wild adulterous bunch of worldly
[1:51:59] Hollywood and cannot stay with the
[1:52:02] unadulterated word because it's not even
[1:52:04] included in the
[1:52:06] promise
[1:52:08] that's if that isn't a warning to us if
[1:52:11] we ever try to go to organized religion
[1:52:14] and her
[1:52:15] son what's going to happen a wild man A
[1:52:19] Wild Worship untameable unconvertible
[1:52:24] unregenerated contrary to God's word you
[1:52:27] believe that Saints amen because it's
[1:52:30] not it cannot attain it cannot stay with
[1:52:32] the unadulterated word because it's not
[1:52:34] even included in the
[1:52:36] promise oh my
[1:52:39] okay that proves that a life under the
[1:52:42] Bond woman
[1:52:44] or the the church that's trying to live
[1:52:48] under law will bring forth a life that
[1:52:52] is
[1:52:55] untameable young
[1:52:57] people I know I know what it's like I
[1:53:00] walked that walk I was in the message
[1:53:04] when it was being taught that way and
[1:53:07] we've got to come to the
[1:53:08] maturity that's not what we're asking of
[1:53:10] you today that's not what's being asked
[1:53:13] of us we're actually telling
[1:53:15] you uh I was speaking about this in uh
[1:53:20] brother Dan's Church
[1:53:23] a caged animal is the most
[1:53:27] ferocious a caged animal is the most
[1:53:32] untameable he's he's damaged he's lost
[1:53:35] his mind he's unable to be free he's
[1:53:38] unable and then you let him out of his
[1:53:39] cage and he's going to bite
[1:53:42] everything he's just wild he's the
[1:53:45] wildest creature you can ever get is a
[1:53:47] is a cage animal so if you take the
[1:53:50] message and you teach it like a bunch of
[1:53:52] law laws and standards and regulations
[1:53:55] and oppression what do you think is
[1:53:57] going to happen to the young people what
[1:53:59] do you think is going to happen to their
[1:54:00] lives well of course they're they
[1:54:02] they're raging beast that's right amen
[1:54:06] it's unconvertible it's unregenerated
[1:54:08] you going to have to wait they they most
[1:54:11] likely will go off into the world and
[1:54:13] fall and so on and then have by the
[1:54:15] grace of God have to come back and you
[1:54:18] as a church must provide the way back
[1:54:22] if that be the case then we must see to
[1:54:24] it that we are not trying to live the
[1:54:26] life under the anointing of the Bond
[1:54:28] woman amen so
[1:54:33] Egypt we're going to be closing just now
[1:54:36] Egypt has become a prophetic spiritual
[1:54:39] condition Amen in the Book of
[1:54:42] Revelations in Prophecy Jerusalem of the
[1:54:45] present world is called Sodom and
[1:54:49] Egypt Revelations 11 amen the two
[1:54:52] prophets will come to that City they
[1:54:55] will lay in a street that
[1:54:56] City the Jerusalem which is called Sodom
[1:55:00] and Egypt right how is Jerusalem called
[1:55:03] Sodom in
[1:55:04] Egypt why it's telling you that it's
[1:55:07] going to be filled with immorality and
[1:55:09] it's going to take the people bondage
[1:55:11] yes right and it's become a present
[1:55:15] condition am amen because of its ability
[1:55:18] to put people in bondage through through
[1:55:21] traditions and forms of godliness let's
[1:55:25] read Revelations 118 quickly and their
[1:55:28] dead bodies shall lie in the street of
[1:55:30] their great city which spiritually is
[1:55:32] called Sodom and Egypt where also our
[1:55:35] Lord was crucified our Lord was
[1:55:37] crucified in Jerusalem that was the city
[1:55:41] but the scripture is telling us that
[1:55:43] Jerusalem will become Sodom and Egypt
[1:55:45] this is telling you that this is
[1:55:49] possible for Holy churches
[1:55:52] yes to become immoral and slave
[1:55:58] drivers and you know when you think of
[1:56:00] the word slave drivers you you're going
[1:56:01] to think well you know they're not
[1:56:05] really that strict they're not really
[1:56:09] that
[1:56:11] bad you don't have to be a slave driver
[1:56:14] who whips the people you can be a slave
[1:56:16] driver who manipulates them
[1:56:18] psychologically that's right amen it's
[1:56:21] so easy
[1:56:23] when you teach a certain type of
[1:56:26] behavior and you whip them by making
[1:56:29] them feel less because you're more
[1:56:31] powerful in your
[1:56:35] gifts I was there in
[1:56:37] those youth meetings and those
[1:56:40] conventions where they were trying to
[1:56:43] get us to
[1:56:44] act and where there was whooping and
[1:56:46] screaming and all kinds of things and I
[1:56:49] I knew the guys were falling yeah I knew
[1:56:52] the the guys who were behaving like they
[1:56:54] were getting the Holy Ghost they were my
[1:56:56] friends and I knew they were
[1:56:59] Hypocrites
[1:57:01] amen yes amen they were not fooling me I
[1:57:05] don't know what they had but I knew it
[1:57:07] wasn't the Holy
[1:57:10] Ghost I can say that confidently without
[1:57:13] offending the Holy
[1:57:15] Ghost because I knew they didn't love
[1:57:17] the word it was a love of self it was
[1:57:20] peer pressure
[1:57:23] right and what does it produce well if
[1:57:26] it is the spirit of God it's going to
[1:57:28] lead you into a life that is going to be
[1:57:32] Conquering the spirit of evil in this
[1:57:34] flesh it's going to be Conquering the
[1:57:36] son of the Bond woman it's going to Le
[1:57:38] it but if it leads into wildness Untamed
[1:57:41] nature unconverted nature amen right
[1:57:46] amen we don't want
[1:57:48] that Jerusalem of the now becomes an
[1:57:51] Egypt for the Jews in the tribulation
[1:57:54] how much more has Church tradition and
[1:57:56] religion formed a spiritual Egypt to
[1:57:59] make slaves out of free
[1:58:01] people so any person that is ruled by
[1:58:05] any system of law religion culture
[1:58:10] listen I don't know what it's like here
[1:58:13] where I come from there's a lot of
[1:58:15] different cultures in on the continent
[1:58:17] of Africa with such a mixture of
[1:58:19] cultures and those cultures rule the the
[1:58:22] people yes sir they literally remove the
[1:58:26] the true essence of the word you were
[1:58:28] trapped by the culture you were born
[1:58:30] into
[1:58:32] tribalism like you're you're being
[1:58:35] blackmailed into respecting Elders who
[1:58:38] are not even teaching you the truth
[1:58:40] pastors who are preaching
[1:58:42] faults leaders of churches that are
[1:58:44] preaching false and you're just trapped
[1:58:46] because you are taught you have to
[1:58:48] respect them that's right and it's a
[1:58:50] culture not it's it's not even something
[1:58:52] that is of the
[1:58:55] word it is in Egypt and has them in
[1:58:59] bondage the life that they produced is
[1:59:02] just the Beast nature pretending to be a
[1:59:04] Son of God look at what happened with
[1:59:06] ishmail did you see what happened in the
[1:59:07] Bible ishmail was persecuting Isaac
[1:59:13] right he's a wild man and Ishmael may
[1:59:17] have the Holy Ghost yes sir amen he had
[1:59:20] the circumcision
[1:59:24] first at the horrible age of
[1:59:27] 13 but Israel or Isaac received the
[1:59:33] circumcision according to the proper law
[1:59:36] right when he was born so Ishmael may
[1:59:40] have gifts abilities amen strengths it
[1:59:45] may produce fruit all the time as well
[1:59:48] in fact it will produce more fruit than
[1:59:51] Isaac will
[1:59:55] but it is from a system of law religion
[1:59:57] tradition and culture it is not the
[1:59:59] predestinated life of the genan seed so
[2:00:03] what is it it's just the
[2:00:05] shark the son of the Bond woman yes
[2:00:08] glory to God let's read uh seed is not
[2:00:11] air with the
[2:00:12] shark we're almost
[2:00:17] closing you love the Lord
[2:00:19] Saints that's the way with people people
[2:00:22] who profess Christ many of them look
[2:00:25] like Christians try to act like
[2:00:27] Christians but you've got to have Christ
[2:00:29] on the inside of you which is the word
[2:00:32] made manifest or it'll never mature into
[2:00:36] a real Bible believ in Christian it'll
[2:00:39] always be a denominational
[2:00:42] something I love the way he speaks it
[2:00:45] cannot live because there's no life in
[2:00:48] it to live he's obviously not talking
[2:00:50] about denominations by their name when
[2:00:52] he means denominational he means it's
[2:00:54] something by organized
[2:00:56] religion right it'll never mature into
[2:00:59] real Bible believ in Christians always
[2:01:01] be something that comes out of organized
[2:01:04] religion amen it cannot live last quote
[2:01:09] there's only one way to be a Christian
[2:01:11] the word Christian means Christlike and
[2:01:14] you can't do
[2:01:17] it you can't work it in yourself if
[2:01:22] you're trying that's a Bond woman and
[2:01:25] that's a bond woman's son right there
[2:01:28] there's no way at all you can do it you
[2:01:30] have to forget yourself die out to
[2:01:33] yourself and let Christ come in and Live
[2:01:36] the Life of Christ in you that's a
[2:01:38] foundational thing that we as people who
[2:01:40] believe in the open book need to
[2:01:42] realize I just
[2:01:45] rest just stop
[2:01:48] fighting know that Isaac is the son of
[2:01:51] the free woman
[2:01:53] I don't want to fight with myself
[2:01:54] anymore Lord I just want you to produce
[2:01:57] that life within me I want to just feed
[2:01:59] on the word I want to get more of that
[2:02:02] word I want to immerse myself in that
[2:02:03] word I want the life to come out from
[2:02:06] that that feminine Gene seed I'm tired
[2:02:09] of fighting with churchianity and trying
[2:02:12] to prove myself to people I just want to
[2:02:14] soak myself in there I just want to live
[2:02:16] the life that you predestinated me to be
[2:02:19] I want to live without reproach I want
[2:02:21] to live without feeling like everyone's
[2:02:23] watching me that I have to perform for
[2:02:26] them that I have to do what they think
[2:02:27] is right I just want to live by the genc
[2:02:30] that is inside I want to live by that
[2:02:33] which it can produce I don't want it to
[2:02:35] be my abilities or someone else teaching
[2:02:38] me about something or asking me or
[2:02:40] forcing me to be some way I don't want
[2:02:42] to be a rule follower I don't want to be
[2:02:45] pleasing people by following rules and
[2:02:47] then because rules are always adjusting
[2:02:50] amen right and you can just never attain
[2:02:53] just when you follow a rule they
[2:02:55] increase something or adjust something
[2:02:56] or change something and then we're going
[2:02:59] on for decades and decades and no one's
[2:03:01] getting it
[2:03:02] right I want to be what you want me to
[2:03:05] be let us realize we cannot do this by
[2:03:08] our strength of our own human character
[2:03:11] that is so affected by pride and
[2:03:13] arrogance I can't tell you how much this
[2:03:15] means to me how much it helps me because
[2:03:18] I I I know when I when I assess myself
[2:03:21] every single day I know when it's my
[2:03:24] ability when when I'm trying to do
[2:03:26] something where I'm trying to circumvent
[2:03:29] the word in some way where I'm trying to
[2:03:31] say something or do something for some
[2:03:33] kind of attention or to be right about
[2:03:35] something or to be more right than
[2:03:38] someone else you just know that Holy
[2:03:40] Spirit checks you in there and you know
[2:03:41] it's not about you it's not about the
[2:03:44] flesh it's not about recognition it's
[2:03:47] about what God wants it's about his
[2:03:49] purpose for me for today amen we must
[2:03:52] have his life come alive in us when we
[2:03:54] can produce this predestinated life we
[2:03:57] cannot go in the Rapture with our Bond
[2:04:01] woman produced life we have to have the
[2:04:04] revelation of the free woman and live in
[2:04:07] that that is our hope that is our stay
[2:04:09] that is our solid rock that is our part
[2:04:12] in the Rapture the bond shall not be air
[2:04:15] with the free amen praise be to God
[2:04:19] let's bow our heads together Hallelujah
[2:04:21] as the musicians come up brother Chad
[2:04:25] we'll bring this to a
[2:04:27] close
[2:04:28] amen praise be to God don't you love him
[2:04:33] Saints let's bow our heads Heavenly
[2:04:37] Father how wonderful you are to us
[2:04:41] Lord wonderful in your all your
[2:04:44] ways this has been something that the
[2:04:48] scriptures openly spoke to us about
[2:04:51] and the trials therein of all those sons
[2:04:55] of God who had to deal with this Bond
[2:04:57] woman and her
[2:04:59] son and it all started because the free
[2:05:02] woman allowed it to
[2:05:05] happen but we know Lord that your word
[2:05:09] tells
[2:05:10] us that we were trapped into this body
[2:05:13] that's and this body was the part that
[2:05:18] started
[2:05:19] first that started enjoying the presence
[2:05:22] of the Lord and
[2:05:24] started creating rules and revivals of
[2:05:28] all kind and started enjoying what it
[2:05:31] was feeling and took dominion over
[2:05:35] us we see it in our personal lives we
[2:05:38] see it in the growth of the message
[2:05:40] church we see it in the history of the
[2:05:43] Christian
[2:05:44] church but Lord we believe you have
[2:05:47] chosen us you have chosen and
[2:05:52] predestinated us unto that adoption of
[2:05:54] sons that maturity by which the same as
[2:05:58] Moses by faith we refuse to be called
[2:06:02] the son of Pharaoh's daughter that's
[2:06:04] right we refuse we reject that Egyptian
[2:06:07] identity we reject that Bond woman and
[2:06:10] her son Lord we pray for this your
[2:06:13] church these your
[2:06:15] people for all of us Lord The church
[2:06:19] here the church back home the Believers
[2:06:22] who are the bride of
[2:06:24] Christ we believe this Rapture cannot
[2:06:26] take place until we completely and
[2:06:29] utterly cast out the Bond woman and her
[2:06:33] son because the bond cannot be air with
[2:06:36] the
[2:06:37] free Lord I pray that this may become a
[2:06:40] a realization to us a revelation to us
[2:06:44] above everything else Lord we we love
[2:06:47] that you have opened those Seven
[2:06:49] Seals we love that you have revealed the
[2:06:52] Mysteries to us we love the open book we
[2:06:55] love the Fellowship of the word father
[2:06:57] but every time we leave this spiritual
[2:07:00] anointing we go back into the carnality
[2:07:02] of life back to our homes back to our
[2:07:06] families and we want to be as real as we
[2:07:09] can be we're tired of
[2:07:11] living by the rules and the laws of
[2:07:16] religion we're tired of the fear of
[2:07:19] wanting to be safe
[2:07:21] wanting to be secure by rules that can
[2:07:25] protect us by rules that can guide us
[2:07:26] and give us control in our
[2:07:29] lives we want to be free we want to be
[2:07:33] set free and live by the Revelation that
[2:07:35] you put in our hearts make it real Lord
[2:07:38] we pray for every person for every
[2:07:41] husband every wife every child every
[2:07:45] youth Lord for all of us officers in the
[2:07:48] church
