[48:25] dearly beloved we are gathered together
[48:27] in the presence of God to join together
[48:30] this man and woman in holy matrimony
[48:33] it is an honorable estate instituted of
[48:35] God signifying unto us the mystical
[48:38] Union that is between Christ and his
[48:40] church
[48:40] it is commended in the scripture to be
[48:42] honorable among all and therefore is not
[48:45] by any to be entered into unadvisedly or
[48:47] lightly but reverently discreetly
[48:50] advisedly soberly and in the fear of God
[48:54] and to this holy estate these two
[48:56] persons come now to be joined we have

[50:32] pray together
[50:34] dear heavenly father we thank you Lord
[50:36] Jesus for this privilege to be here
[50:38] today
[50:39] God each one of us that are here we
[50:41] count it Lord to be a privilege to see
[50:43] what you have done in the lives of our
[50:44] brother Daniel and sister Caitlyn now
[50:46] you've brought him to this time
[50:48] and God surely you force all this time
[50:50] before the foundation of the world and
[50:52] knew that they would be joined as
[50:53] husband and wife I pray God everything
[50:56] we do would be pleasing to you and God
[50:58] that you would bless the ceremony would
[51:00] bless all our efforts in this uniting in
[51:03] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[51:07] amen as we look at marriage we see it's
[51:10] a major theme in the Bible and every
[51:12] time we come to a wedding it's such a
[51:14] wonderful opportunity to review Once
[51:16] Again the things that God has laid in
[51:18] the scriptures for us concerning
[51:20] marriage for it is the great mystery
[51:22] contained throughout the entire
[51:24] scripture we find it first in Genesis
[51:26] when God in the beginning forms the
[51:29] world and creates as Eden and he makes a
[51:31] son and places a son to rule over Eden
[51:33] but then God himself decrees that it is
[51:36] not good that man shall dwell alone I
[51:39] will make a help meet for him so it was
[51:41] God who who presented the first wife to
[51:44] his son so out from Adam he pulls a rib
[51:47] and he takes the feminine spirit and he
[51:49] forms the woman and unites the two
[51:51] together in what we see in the
[51:53] scriptures is the first marriage and the
[51:55] first marriage was performed by God it
[51:57] was instituted by God and it becomes the
[52:00] first of all human institutions so God
[52:03] designed marriage it was God's idea and
[52:06] God's concept therefore marriage is not
[52:09] man's idea but God's therefore man
[52:12] cannot manipulate it to his purpose man
[52:14] cannot change it to suit his needs or
[52:17] his desire Amen to understand marriage
[52:19] you have to go to the original and it
[52:21] was designed and instituted by God
[52:23] himself amen and God was foreshadowing
[52:26] in this something that he would do
[52:28] throughout all of scripture
[52:30] then we we see that later on as we go
[52:32] through scripture he chooses Abraham of
[52:35] all the people in the earth he comes and
[52:36] chooses Abraham and makes a promise to
[52:38] him and to his seat after him that he
[52:40] would he would be their God and they
[52:42] would be his people and we know that he
[52:44] redeems the Mount of Egypt and he brings
[52:46] them to himself and in the book of
[52:48] Jeremiah he says that I have become a
[52:50] husband to Israel I am married to Israel
[52:52] and God wanted a people to be United
[52:55] with him and we know that this people
[52:57] failed to keep their Covenant the
[52:59] Covenant that they accepted at Mount
[53:01] Sinai they failed and they broke but
[53:04] that didn't stop God's purpose for later
[53:07] we find in the New Testament that he
[53:09] once again is choosing a bride amen of
[53:12] his choice through the New Testament now
[53:14] he's selecting a gentile bride amen and
[53:17] we find that all the way at the end in
[53:20] the Book of Revelation we find the term
[53:22] bride appearing again for the bride hath
[53:24] made herself ready we find that there's
[53:26] a wife at the end and that wife is the
[53:29] Lamb's bride and we know that the
[53:31] marriage of the Lamb has come so we find
[53:34] that marriage is a theme from beginning
[53:36] to end in the scriptures it's important
[53:39] to God and therein lies a great mystery
[53:42] So today we're going to have a tradition
[53:45] that sister Caitlyn and brother Daniel
[53:47] have requested they would like to
[53:49] Performance an old tradition in which at
[53:51] some portion in the ceremony Caitlyn
[53:54] sister Caitlin will take a portion of
[53:55] her veil and she will drape it over the
[53:57] shoulder of her brother Daniel
[53:59] and in doing so she will signify that
[54:02] she is giving herself to this man that
[54:04] all she is she's entrusting to him and
[54:07] she's signifying that by the placing of
[54:09] the veil over her shoulder as Daniel
[54:11] lends his shoulder for this Veil and
[54:13] accepts the veil he's accepting
[54:15] responsibility for this woman to care
[54:18] for her and to keep her for the rest of
[54:19] her life so it's a wonderful tradition
[54:22] and in preparation for that I'd like to
[54:24] begin to look at that through the
[54:25] scriptures by starting by looking at the
[54:28] shoulder what is the significance of the
[54:30] shoulder and I'd like to begin in Isaiah
[54:32] chapter 9 verse 6. it says For unto us a
[54:36] child is born unto us the son is given
[54:38] and the government shall be upon his
[54:41] shoulder and his name Shall be Called
[54:43] wonderful counselor the Mighty God the
[54:45] Everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[54:47] of the increase of his government and
[54:50] peace there shall be no end upon the
[54:52] throne of David and upon his kingdom to
[54:54] order it and to establish it with
[54:55] judgment with Justice from henceforth
[54:58] even forever the Zeal of the Lord of
[55:00] hosts will perform this so we find out
[55:03] that Christ is coming as the son of
[55:05] David to sit upon the throne of David
[55:07] and the government shall be upon his
[55:09] shoulder that means the entire Kingdom
[55:11] the responsibility and care of the whole
[55:13] Kingdom rests upon his shoulder because
[55:16] the shoulder in the back is the
[55:18] strongest part of a man
[55:19] and that shoulder and back signifies the
[55:22] strength of a man that upon the strength
[55:25] of Jesus Christ this Kingdom will rest
[55:27] not upon the strength of the subjects
[55:29] but upon the strength of the king amen
[55:31] and so we see a beautiful type of this
[55:34] in Luke Chapter 15. Jesus is speaking in
[55:37] Luke chapter 15 verse 4 it says what man
[55:40] of you having a hundred sheep if you
[55:42] lose one of them doth not leave the 1909
[55:44] in the wilderness and go after that
[55:46] which is lost until he find it and when
[55:50] he hath found it he layeth it on his
[55:52] shoulders rejoicing amen we find that
[55:55] there's a lost sheep just like we were
[55:57] one of God's lost sheep before he found
[55:59] us and that sheep had no ability to save
[56:01] itself he had no strength to find its
[56:04] way home amen it wasn't depending on its
[56:06] own strength for salvation but it was
[56:08] the strength of the Shepherd that was
[56:09] declared and the shepherd sought out the
[56:12] the little lost sheep and the shepherd
[56:15] found the sheep and when he found him he
[56:17] took the sheep and placed the Sheep upon
[56:19] the strongest part of the shoulder the
[56:22] the shepherd across his shoulders
[56:23] showing that that sheep was not saved by
[56:27] its own strength by its own will by its
[56:30] own wisdom but that sheep was saved by
[56:32] the strength of the shepherd and we have
[56:34] been saved by the strength of the
[56:36] shepherd not our own strength not our
[56:38] own ability we could not find ourselves
[56:39] we could not find the shepherd we were
[56:42] lost but the shepherd found us and laid
[56:44] us upon his shoulders for the government
[56:47] shall be upon his shoulders
[56:49] and another element of this I want to
[56:51] look at is in Revelations chapter 3
[56:53] verse 7.
[56:54] it says unto the angel of the church in
[56:56] Philadelphia right these things saith he
[56:58] that is Holy he that is true he that
[57:01] hath the Key of David he that openeth
[57:03] and no man shutteth and shutteth in no
[57:05] man openeth we know that Christ is the
[57:09] son of David will sit upon the throne of
[57:11] David but also he seemed depicted here
[57:13] as having the Key of David in this
[57:15] scripture in Revelation is referring
[57:17] back to a scripture in the book of
[57:18] Isaiah Isaiah 22 verse 22 says in the
[57:22] key of the House of David will I lay
[57:24] upon his shoulder so this key will be
[57:27] upon his shoulder so he shall open and
[57:30] None Shall shut and he shall shut and
[57:32] None Shall open
[57:34] the prophet of God and the church age
[57:36] book says this
[57:38] but what does this key signify he's
[57:40] tying all these scriptures together now
[57:42] what does this key signify the answer
[57:45] lies in the position of the key it is
[57:48] not in his hand it is not worn around
[57:50] his neck it is not placed in the hands
[57:51] of other men or the verse could not be
[57:54] saying that he alone has the use of that
[57:56] key for he alone opens and shuts and no
[57:59] man has that right but Jesus himself
[58:02] isn't that right but where is the key it
[58:04] is on his shoulder but what does the
[58:06] shoulder have to do with it in reverse
[58:09] the Isaiah 9 6 and the government shall
[58:11] be upon his shoulder but what does this
[58:13] mean the answer is in the phrase
[58:15] government upon his shoulder comes from
[58:18] the wedding ceremony of the East when
[58:21] the bride has been committed to the
[58:22] groom she takes off her veil and places
[58:24] it over the groom's shoulders signifying
[58:26] that not only is she under his Dominion
[58:28] that she has transferred her rights to
[58:31] him
[58:32] that is that he is the head but also
[58:35] that he Bears the responsibility and the
[58:37] care and that he and he alone no one
[58:40] else no other man no other power has any
[58:43] right and responsibility and that
[58:46] beloved is the Key of David God
[58:50] Sovereign God being Sovereign he
[58:52] foreknew by Divine decree exactly who
[58:55] would be in his bride he chose her she
[58:57] did not choose him he called her she did
[59:00] not come on her own he died for her he
[59:03] washed her in his own blood he paid the
[59:05] price for her she belongs to him and to
[59:08] him alone she is wholly committed to him
[59:10] and he accepts the obligation
[59:13] he is her head for Christ is the head of
[59:15] his church as Sarah called Abraham Lord
[59:17] even so the bride is happy that he is
[59:20] her Lord
[59:21] he speaks and she obeys for that is her
[59:24] Delight
[59:25] amen he chose her amen we see this in
[59:30] John 15 when Jesus says in John 15 16 ye
[59:33] have not chosen me but I have chosen you
[59:35] and ordained you that you should go and
[59:38] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[59:39] should remain the disciples weren't
[59:41] looking for Christ Christ was looking
[59:43] for them they didn't choose him he chose
[59:45] them and they responded to that call
[59:48] amen and so in in in the great story
[59:52] that we see through the scriptures that
[59:54] God he was foreshadowing all the way
[59:57] back in Genesis what he wanted to do
[59:58] amen he was going to have a son and that
[1:00:01] son was going to have a bride but we
[1:00:03] know that in the fall of Man in order
[1:00:05] for him to take a bride he would have to
[1:00:07] pay a price of redemption so that he
[1:00:09] could unite because she was now on a
[1:00:11] fallen state for all of mankind was
[1:00:13] fallen so Christ came to bear our sins
[1:00:17] on his shoulders and he bore those sins
[1:00:19] all the way to Calvary so he could pay
[1:00:22] the price for us he was taking response
[1:00:25] ability for our sin he was taking
[1:00:28] responsibility for our fails our
[1:00:30] failures our mistakes our life and he
[1:00:33] was bearing that responsibility so that
[1:00:35] he could Purge us and free us from that
[1:00:37] so he could Unite with us in a union and
[1:00:41] he could we could be one flesh amen with
[1:00:43] Christ
[1:00:44] we see this in Isaiah 53 verse 4 it says
[1:00:47] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[1:00:50] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[1:00:52] him stricken smitten of God and
[1:00:54] Afflicted but he was wounded for our
[1:00:56] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:00:58] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:01:00] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[1:01:03] healed all we like sheep have gone
[1:01:05] astray we have turned everyone to his
[1:01:07] own way and the Lord hath laid on him
[1:01:08] the iniquity of us all then in verse 11
[1:01:12] it says he shall see the travail of his
[1:01:14] soul and shall be satisfied by his
[1:01:16] knowledge shall my righteous servant
[1:01:18] justify many for he shall bear their
[1:01:20] iniquities therefore will I divide him a
[1:01:23] portion with the great and he shall
[1:01:24] divide the spoil with the strong because
[1:01:26] he hath poured out a soul into death and
[1:01:29] he was numbered with the transgression
[1:01:31] transgressors and he bear the sins of
[1:01:33] many and made intercession for the
[1:01:36] transgression
[1:01:37] Jesus yielded his shoulders for us
[1:01:40] amen he invites us now to lay our life
[1:01:44] upon his shoulder so what you'll
[1:01:46] demonstrate shortly here is a
[1:01:48] demonstration of the great Union between
[1:01:50] Christ and his bride and the great
[1:01:52] opportunity that a people have to lay
[1:01:55] their life at Christ's feet and to take
[1:01:58] their Veil amen and lay it over his
[1:02:01] shoulder and he has already lended his
[1:02:04] shoulder for the occasion and he will
[1:02:07] bear our life taking full responsibility
[1:02:09] for whatever we have been he takes
[1:02:12] responsibility for it what we are is
[1:02:15] what he wants because he has chosen Us
[1:02:17] and how is that choice manifest because
[1:02:20] all none can come to me unless the
[1:02:22] father draws him and if the father is
[1:02:25] pricking the heart and drawing it is a
[1:02:27] declaration of Christ's Choice amen and
[1:02:30] if we can respond to that choice he has
[1:02:32] a shoulder there that we can lay our
[1:02:34] whole life upon and now he will free us
[1:02:37] from our life by his shoulder by them
[1:02:40] what he bore on his shoulder and he
[1:02:42] carries our sins far away
[1:02:45] freeing us so that now he can unite to
[1:02:48] us whatever we were he takes
[1:02:50] responsibility for whatever we are is
[1:02:53] what he has chosen what we will be he is
[1:02:56] obligated to care for and take care of
[1:02:58] from here on out amen so now we can
[1:03:02] truly see Colossians 3 3 for you are
[1:03:05] dead and your life is hid with Christ in
[1:03:08] God now you've given your life to him
[1:03:11] you've died to your life you've been
[1:03:13] renewed in Christ to a New Life
[1:03:16] I I am sorry to say but not so sorry to
[1:03:19] say that during this ceremony at some
[1:03:21] point in this ceremony there will no
[1:03:24] longer be a Caitlyn Williams
[1:03:26] she will fade off the scene
[1:03:29] whatever she was will fade away because
[1:03:31] during this ceremony she will be
[1:03:33] transformed from Caitlyn Williams to
[1:03:36] Caitlyn errand
[1:03:37] and it's a new name and it's a new life
[1:03:40] amen Daniel and making his choice he has
[1:03:43] accepted responsibility for you whatever
[1:03:46] you are whatever you were wherever
[1:03:48] you've been he Bears the responsibility
[1:03:51] by making his choice he says I'll take
[1:03:54] that on me what you are now is what he
[1:03:56] wants for you are his choice above all
[1:03:59] others he chose you amen and in doing so
[1:04:02] he's purged you from any idea anybody
[1:04:05] else has because now you will be the
[1:04:08] wife of a husband and nobody else has
[1:04:10] any say in it whatsoever it was Daniel's
[1:04:13] choice right and then from this day
[1:04:16] forward whatever will happen whatever
[1:04:18] circumstances happen in life he is oh he
[1:04:21] will pledge himself through this
[1:04:23] ceremony to care for all of your burdens
[1:04:26] and to carry all of your loads and to
[1:04:28] help you through everything that happens
[1:04:29] for Christ has taken the responsibility
[1:04:33] for all of our sins he bore upon himself
[1:04:36] and accepted us he chose us as we are
[1:04:38] now because we're the one he wants and
[1:04:40] he's from almost whatever will be in the
[1:04:42] future he will take care of it
[1:04:45] amen
[1:04:46] now we can see first Peter 5 7. casting
[1:04:50] all your care upon him for he careth for
[1:04:54] you this word casting in the Greek means
[1:04:57] to throw upon to place upon so we can
[1:04:59] throw Upon Our Place Upon Our husband
[1:05:01] Jesus Christ all of our care and that
[1:05:04] care means care or anxiety whatever
[1:05:07] we're worried about whatever is
[1:05:09] stressing us whatever we cannot solve
[1:05:10] ourselves we can place that and throw
[1:05:13] that or cast out upon Christ's shoulders
[1:05:15] and then it says for he careth for you
[1:05:17] this word careth means to take care of
[1:05:20] or to care about
[1:05:22] so from this day forward you can take
[1:05:25] all of your anxieties and all of your
[1:05:27] worries you no longer have to care for
[1:05:29] yourself for there is a man that you've
[1:05:31] come under the headship of that's
[1:05:33] pledged to care for you you can cast all
[1:05:36] of your anxiety upon him just like the
[1:05:39] Bride of Jesus Christ has no care or no
[1:05:42] worry that she cannot cast Upon Jesus
[1:05:44] Christ and he's obligated himself to
[1:05:47] take care of it and care for us
[1:05:50] Amen in the demonstration that you're
