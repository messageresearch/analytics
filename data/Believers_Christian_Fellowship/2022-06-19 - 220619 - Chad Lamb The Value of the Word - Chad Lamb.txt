together to worship your name to hear your word preached god you're so faithful lord and god we want to be faithful to you and we just pray you would help us gone we come to hear your word lord we pray you would feed us on your word that you give us ears to hear eyes to see in our heart to perceive all that you have for us this day may you lord break the bread of life and i pray you take this vessel under your control and take these lips lord and may you speak your word through them norm as we yield ourselves to you and ask that you would take preeminence in all of us for lord we love you we thank you god for the day that you've called us to live in we thank you for the word that you've given us in this day and may we be faithful to you and to your word lord we ask you to help us lord in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you i want to say happy father's day to all the fathers out there it's a wonderful day father's day will never eclipse mother's day but it's a good day anyhow amen god bless you let's take our bibles and read while we're standing out of the gospel of john john chapter 1 verse 1 and then we'll read one verse of scripture and let you have your seats john chapter 1 verse 1. super familiar we could probably quote it but i like reading it together as a foundation for this thought it says that john 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was gone i think we could read that verse at the start of every service and still find something more in there because this is everything to us amen in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god god bless you as you have your seeds and i want to say as a father's day greeting i was thinking god didn't lay on my heart a father's day message he just laid something else on my heart so we always follow the leading of the spirit so we don't have christmas message at christmas and father's day messes and eastern message sometimes it works out that way and sometimes it doesn't but we have to follow inspiration but as i was thinking about the fathers and the men in the assembly and i just say thank god for you brothers that will lead your homes amen that is a very rare thing in the society the day and age that we live in to have men that will take leadership there's a lack of leadership all over the world there's lack of leadership in business lack of leadership and community lack of leadership in politics there seems to be no leadership anywhere and to find a man who will sacrifice himself and lay down his life and take the time to lead his wife and lead his family i say god bless you amen and it's wonderful to look around and see many that are like that not few and we know that's a product of the word amen it's not a product if we just well you just happen to be the best guys out there but we know that that's a life surrender to the word we'll bring the life of the word and the life of the word is true leadership because the word is our leader then we have a father so the father gives the word if we surrender to the word and god's called you to be a father then you'll reflect the attributes of father but i just want to say god bless you it's rare but we find it here amen in a minifold manifestation because of god's word and we're thankful for that amen so keep up the good work keep feeding on the word and letting god do the work through you amen i tell you when you have fathers who will lead homes it makes a pastor's job way easier when you have men who will step into position and take leadership take responsibility do the praying do the searching now you know sit down with the family give the godly instruction i tell you it makes a pastor's job much much easier to have daddy at the head of the home especially a spiritual daddy who loves the lord that'll put his his wings out his umbrella and bring all the family together under the umbrella of the word it's a wonderful place to be amen so i want to say i appreciate your brothers also i i said thank you on wednesday night for your prayers and support for angie and i when we we went on this anniversary trip we had a wonderful time and i just wanted to share his way of testimony we saw the hand of god in every turn on this trip and i was a bit surprised although i shouldn't have been but i was that god would so bless and so put his fingerprint on a trip to go rest i've seen him do it on trips to go minister all the time when we're going to minister we're going overseas we're traveling you see god work out circumstances he works out situations he makes it obvious he's with it but god did some of the the most vindication i've ever had on the trip was on this trip to go and rest and i say thank you god amen the prophet told us we need that it's something that he told us to do but i saw god vindicate it and for me it was a comfort i was able to go and relax because i felt like god was in it and so it was really good for me and we were able to completely disconnect and really relax and have a good time so i didn't even think about preaching the whole time so i come back and i was so thankful that we had wednesday night service covered so i didn't have to get into that mode already i could just come and enjoy the service with you all and so as i've been preparing over the last few days i was like boy i forgot how to preach amen i so disconnected i lost it all but praise be to god god is good amen i remember i was telling one of the brothers one time brother branham took three months off and preaching and he come back and he was saying you know preaching something you've got to stick with he goes i'm nervous i said i've taken two weeks off and i'm nervous amen but you just pull on the gift and we'll trust god amen god hasn't forgot how to deliver his word amen so i just i just say that was we were so relaxed and we just appreciated that time appreciate you guys were so supportive and so thoughtful and so kind and we appreciate that as well i also want to thank the ministers who ministered while we were gone we had a chance to catch up on all the services and we enjoyed them all it was a blessing to listen to him and so it did my heart good to hear the word and i had a this thought that's been on my heart i was ministering in this line before i left and some of the brothers even were picking it up in the same same vein and and this morning i just want to take a thought that i've been meditating on and preach on the value of the word so it's this is nothing nothing earth shattering nothing new but just something i've been dealing with and meditating for myself the value of the word i don't think we can put enough value on the word that's been given to us in fact i think we're constantly undervaluing not intentionally but just because we're carnal minded just because we're human beings we don't realize sometimes the the depth and the the breadth of what's been given to us we don't sometimes take into full account how powerful how wonderful how marvelous the gift that god has given to us in this end time by sending a prophet and restoring the word amen it wasn't a trivial thing it's not a light thing amen it is it is the thing that he's been waiting for for six thousand years amen and he's delivered the word to his bride and we could never be grateful enough amen we could never be reverent enough to the word we can never be humble enough before this word we can never be submissive enough to this word amen because it's everything to us so we know that in the beginning was the word amen so everything starts with the word amen you know god did not start he always was but but in the beginning was the word so god we know dwelt alone with his thoughts right and and we were part of those thoughts is that do you believe that we were part of his thinking but god did not want to dwell alone with his thoughts amen he wanted to come into a deeper fellowship with those thoughts amen and he wanted to come into i wouldn't say deeper i wanted to come into another form of fellowship to fellowship with his own attributes as a family and in order to do that he would take his thought he would begin to express it as word amen and so in the beginning was word and this became the expression of the thoughts of god and we're so thankful that god began to express amen because now he begins to share what's in his mind amen and god did that because he wants fellowship amen god did that because he wants to be known and he wants to have fellowship and because he wants to be known and he wants to have fellowship he began to express the word and the word is the thought expressed amen so god didn't want to just stay with thoughts with attributes within himself but he wanted to express those to be known and to have fellowship amen so god is still expressing his word because he wants to be known and he wants to have fellowship so god is using his word to bring us into fellowship with himself amen i want to look at a few scriptures let's go to first samuel chapter 3. first samuel chapter 3 and i want to read verse 1. first samuel chapter 3 verse 1 and the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli and the word of the lord was precious in those days there was no open vision and this word precious means valuable prized weighty precious rare or splendid they lived in such a day samuel becomes the the first of the prophets that come on the break on the scene to bring further revelation of the word of god they had the law they've been operating through judges and now samuel comes to kick off the age of the prophets amen and and brother m tells us that the prophets built his body they begin to express the word which jesus christ is the word and it says in this day as samuel ministered as a child the the word of the lord was precious it was valuable it was rare it was weighty amen and it became a precious thing now that god would bring samuel on the scene to begin to bring the word of the lord and we lived in a day the generation passed amen and the generation that's out there not part of the bride but the generation that's out in laodicea is an absolute apostasy in darkness amen the word of god is rare out there we lived in a day where the word of god again had become rare because it was obscured by denominationalism and men's ideas and it had been discounted it had been chopped up it had been separated and divided amen and have been buried underneath the ideas of man and it become obscure amen and it and the once again the the word of god was precious amen it was rare it was valuable you couldn't find it everywhere and so god would raise on the scene again another prophet only this time it was a gentile prophet to come to a gentile bride amen to bring the word of god and it's a precious thing to us amen we don't take it lightly amen what separates us from the rest of the world that is stuck in apostasy and darkness is not our intelligence it's not our willpower it's not our moral character i mean none of that is what separates us the only thing that separates us is the word we have received the word and by receiving the word we receive the life of the word and the life of the word comes in to manifest the word and we've been separated by the precious word amen not not because we we got a better code of conduct a better code of conduct will do everything a code of conduct has done in the past it'll create legalism and it will fail but we've been separated by the word amen the word is precious to us let's go to psalms 107. this is a scripture that i read several weeks ago when i preached on spiritual cancer and i want to go back and and look at this scripture again psalms 107 verse 17. it begins to say in verse 17 fools because of their transgression and because of their iniquities are afflicted so why are they afflicted because of transgressions and iniquities transgressions are doing something against the word and iniquities is not doing something you know to do is right or doing something you know is not right so because of their transgressions because of their transgressions and because of their iniquities they are afflicted their soul aborts all manner of meat and they draw near unto the gates of death they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions all that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men and let them sacrifice the sacrifice of thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing amen he sent his word and healed them they were stuck they were afflicted because of transgressions and iniquities and in their trouble that they created themselves they cried out to him and what was the delivering for us what did he do to deliver them he sent his word he sent his word to deliver he sent his word to heal he sent his word to bring them out they brought themselves in but he sent the word to bring them out amen and this laodicean condition when when we find christ on the outside amen and then total darkness everywhere amen that was created because of transgressions and iniquities amen but there was a cry and he heard the cry and he sent his word amen and he healed us and delivered us from all our destructions brother graham says god must bring judgment upon the earth this is in the message to trial and god has to have something here a standard to judge the world by because it would be unjust in god to judge the world and the world knowing no standard to go by how many believes that's true if the church is the standard which one is it the word god said he would judge the world by jesus christ he is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the same yesterday today and forever so he's got to judge the world by something so he judges the world by his word amen and that was what came forth in the beginning and that is everything amen everything consists of the word right everything was made by the word because it says amen in jesus christ all things were made by him and for him and without him was not anything that was made that was made whether there be principalities or thrones and heavenly places on earth everything that was made was made by the word amen and so and he can in all the world everything consists of the world everything is by the word everything is for the word everything and consists by the word amen so the word is everything and god will judge the world by this word amen romans 2 16 says in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel brother is going to refer to this scripture in the day that god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel paul's saying he's going to judge all men and the secrets of men by jesus christ and and hebrews 4 12 says the word of god is quick powerful sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and the joints in the morrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so what is the discerner the word what is the world judged by the word he's going to judge the secrets amen the secrets of men by jesus christ and brother branham tells us in sirs we would see jesus but he said he would judge the world by jesus christ and jesus christ is the word so he'll judge the world by the word now the bible is the entire revelation of jesus christ this is the revelation nothing is to be added to it or taken from it the same will take in our part from the book of life if we add to if we add or take take from it that is the word of god and we believe it so he said he said he would judge the world by jesus christ he's going to judge the secrets of men by jesus christ but jesus christ is the word amen so he will judge the secrets of men by the word and the word is sharper quicker than the two-edged sword dividing to the morrow and the bone and the soul and the spirit and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and so we saw amen we saw discernment in our day through the ministry of william branham he could give discernment and discern your problem and discern what was going on in your life your sickness and what you've been through and what you should have done or didn't do amen but the word is a discerner the word is the true discerner amen the word is what the world is judged by the word is what the secrets of men is judged by the word is what comes down and separates the soul and the spirit which even when you read through the scriptures it is so hard sometimes in the scriptures to separate the soul and the spirit of man they're so close together but this word will come and divide it amen why because the word exposes everything because the word made everything everything consists by the word and the word discerns everything friends you say how is that possible amen because god amen in our day has restored his word and he's given the word amen and any deviation from that word is a discernment of where your heart is amen if we in any way in any phase are able to take a portion of the message and manipulate it to our own purpose amen or massage it to our own discretion for our own benefit or our own lust our own desires amen be rest assured that that word that was preached was discerning our hearts right there because the question is will he have preeminence that's the question in this day amen will will there be a people that he can unfold the second portion of his threefold plan the second fold is to have preeminence in the people and he's wanting to accomplish that now and preeminence is full control absolute submission to the word so that word is judging us friends that word is discerning us amen we don't need a man to stand in the pulpit amen and bring down discernment and say you did this and you did that you did this what we need is the holy ghost to break the word amen and the word will discern where our heart is if we have any desire to anything other than the message we're being discerned right then is that right if the word is being preached and it's true amen and the word is true and it's coming from the scriptures amen and it's something that the prophet is taught amen and something rises up in us to discredit that amen that word is discerning right there the secrets of men's hearts amen when when when adam and eve were placed here adam and his bride were placed here they were given the word so they were to stand by the word and that word is jesus christ what was it they were given for their protection in the garden of eden jesus christ what were they given they were given the word they were given christ the word and they were told to stand with this word right and if they would have stayed with christ everything would have continued on as god had said it because god had made the world by christ god had established eden by christ he was operating by christ the word and now he was given christ the word to them to keep them protected and in a state of christ of the word of harmony all the time amen but eve because of her own lust that had rose up through an enticement by the serpent amen she deviated from the word was she deceived yes she was deceived but she was deceived because she was enticed of her own lusts and she began to deviate from the commandment and when she deviated from the commandment she was discerned and she was judged judgment came because she left the word discernment came because she left the word amen if she would have stayed with the word everything would have been fine but leaving the word brought the judgments of god amen because because god will judge the world by the word and that's exactly what he did in eden he set the pattern for the rest of the creation for the rest of the world and for the rest of time amen he said it and established it in eden he gave them christ the word they were living in christ the word amen they were they were upheld by christ the word and they'd been made by christ the word they were living in christ the word they were protected by christ the word and when they left christ the word judgment came and when they left christ the word death set in so we start talking about the value of the word amen when i say i don't think we can appreciate it enough the word that god gave them wasn't complex they said don't partake of this tree you may partake of all the other trees but don't partake of this tree it wasn't complicated it wasn't complex but all the value of that commandment the value of that word that simple phrase that simple commandment that wasn't hard to understand it wasn't complex it wasn't complicated it was simple it was straightforward but all the value of that word the value of that word would have kept them in eternal bliss forever amen the value of that word would have kept an eaten condition on the earth perpetually forever there would have been no death there would have been no heartache there would have been no suffering there would have been nothing if they would have stayed with that simple word that simple phrase of all the trees in the garden i'm gonna protect but the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the midst of the garden thou shalt not not not eat of that tree if they would have stayed it's so simple it wasn't hard it wasn't complicated amen but what happened is the serpent came down and began to attach reasoning to the word and he made it complicated he made it does it really mean this or does it really mean that and it's it's it may not be what i thought it was and blah blah blah blah blah and he took what was simple and made it complex and with that he began to beguile the woman by bringing up her lust that were inside of her and by her lust she was led away by her lust she was deceived and then all of a sudden she wanted she began to want a deviation from the word because of the lust that rose up it became an attractive offer it became something that she desired and now she had a desire to something other than christ praise god i just want to set before you the statement that nothing has changed from that day to this it's the same exact thing we face today god has given us his word god has he has been so kind to us because of the deception that was here at the end time because of thousands of years of denominationalism that started with the harlot and then the daughters he was so kind to us that he would give such a display of his power touch the display of his discernment that it would be so it would be so easily recognized that this is a prophet of god amen this is god's mouthpiece and he would begin to open the word in such a way it became undeniable to us that was god's mercy that was god's grace the thousands upon thousands of times amen that there would be healings and miracles blind eyes open lame walking dead rays dumb speaking amen and recorded by doctors recorded in papers recorded on film recorded on tape amen with multitudes of eyewitness testimonies that was god's absolute grace and love to you and i amen and to take that message and begin to manipulate that message and say well that was his opinion or this means that and i'm going to i'm going to timber i think it's an absolute disgrace to the power that god has displayed in this age i think it's one of the most disrespectful things that we could ever do to god amen and i just like to say that word is still discerning us that word is discerning our hearts you know we don't come to service to to find out how good we are we come to service to find out where the devil's still working on us so that that deception can be nipped in the bud by the word brother brahm said in the end time evangelism so you see christianity is an important thing if it cost all this six thousand years of trouble because of one word being misused now we're not going back with one other word misused it's got to be exactly with the word with nobody's interpretation just what the word says i say what is the value of the word if it was the word that kept eden in a perpetual state of perfection do you believe that it was the word it was established by the word of god it was they were dwelling in the word of god by the word of god for the word of god and they were given the word of god to keep it in that state so everything in eden was the word of god and a slight deviation from one simple commandment brought death and a ruination of everything that god had established in eden become into a fallen condition that's the power amen of undervaluing god's word devaluing or undervaluing god's word it brought that kind of destruction that kind of death and we're still suffering today because of that undervaluing of god's word that deviation from god's word everything we suffer with today is because of that do you agree everything we're suffering with is because of not valuing the word of god correctly in the beginning so god now he's working to reestablish his eden upon the earth and you have to ask yourself by what method will he reestablish to eden amen the only thing he can do is bring back what was lost and what was lost was the word amen so he must bring back the word but there has to be a people that will stay with the word in order to bring back an eaten condition because if god will reestablish eden upon the earth and by his spoken word if he will set everything in order again as it was amen and he will establish the nature as it was the earth the cosmos if he will put everything back the way it was but he will put you and i in there without an absolute preeminence among us then he's going to start the cycle right back over again because we'll leave the word and bring eden into a fallen condition so before he can do that he's got to bring the word back and give a word test to a people amen that'll stay true to that word regardless of anything else there's got to be a people who will value that word over their existence because they're not there's no coming back to eden until there's a people that are ready for eden a people who can dwell in eden a people who can stay with the word at all costs that's why the prophet came to give the ingredients for that kind of people amen until we become that kind of people we should stop looking for eden amen amen brother rem said in christ is the mystery of god revealed he says when eve went away from the word she went away from her mate and when the church goes away from the word to a denomination she rejects and commits fornication with the world of man's wisdom rejecting the authority of god's word i'd like to say when he says the church goes away from the word to a denomination don't let that in your mind fall somewhere else because that denominational spirit is the one pressing upon you the denominational spirit is the one that will take your own idea and your own desire amen and massage the word to match your own desire that's the denominational spirit and it's not far from any of us so we can't say well i left the denominations years ago the denominational spirit is the antichrist spirit and it's all around you amen it's working on your hybrid flesh all the time trying to find inroads back to bring all all that the denominational spirit is trying to do is to get you to hybridize the word and if you can hybridize the word then there's no eden coming back there's no destruction of satan's eden amen he sits as a squatter with squatters right and stays in position of creation so that spirit don't say you know uh as long as you leave the word or you go away from the word to a denomination if you go away from the word to your own desire that's a denominational spirit if you deviate ever so slightly from the word for something you want or something you think or some some reasoning that's come from your own mind that's a denominational spirit and so when we do that we reject and commit fornication with the world of man's wisdom even if it's your own rejecting the authority of god's word brother ben says in the church age book in the pergamum church age on page 171 he says the son the second son jesus also a spoken word seed word of god was given a bride like was adam but before he could marry her she also had fallen she like adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of god and live or doubt the word and die she doubted she left the word she died he's talking about the first church she was put to the word test she was given the word she doubted she left the word she died but there's got to come a bride that won't fall by the same thing the previous ones did amen and as we talk about these things and discuss them i can never get away from the fact that i hold it always before my mind that brother benham said this bride won't fall she's predestinated not to oh that's the statement friends that's it that's what gives us courage that's what gives it hope not by my nor by power but by his spirits by my spirit saith the lord it's not me it's his will it's his purpose his plan but i know amen where the deception lies and i know amen how deceiving that spirit is and i know how weak my flesh is and this is what i have to guard against he's promised that there'll be a bride who won't fall and i believe i'm part of that and it's going to be his spirit but oh i don't want to be childish in my ways i don't want to be foolish in my actions amen i want to stay in this word with all that's in me and knowing with all that's in me i'll still fail but he's here to make up the uh the difference amen in the in the church age book again this is further further down to the pyramid church age actually this is the previous statement the evidence of receiving the holy ghost today is just the same as it was back in the day of our lord it is receiving the word of truth for the day in which you live jesus never did stress the importance of works as he did the word he knew that if people got the word the works would follow that is bible i say praise god we've been given the word we need to do the works of god amen so that's why we don't need to chase after works amen we need to chase after the word and the word will produce the works we don't need to go after works or manifestations or things as a vindication the word will vindicate itself amen that's not my vindication my vindication is my faith in the word amen my ability to receive believe and act upon the word of god amen that's what vindicates me as the son of god and then the word vindicates itself through the works so i must be pursuing after the word he goes on saying now jesus knew that there was going to be a terrible drift away from the word and the pergamian age which was yet 200 years off from the patmos vision he knew the driftwood caused them to go into the dark ages he knew that the way man originally got away from god was by first leaving the word if you leave the word you have left god amen what a statement when eve left the word she left her mate when the first church left the word amen they left christ if you leave the word you've left god thus he is presenting himself to the church at pergamus and indeed to all churches of all ages i am the word if you want deity in your in your midst then welcome and receive the word don't ever let anything don't notice the statement don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word this which i am giving you the word is a revelation of myself i am the word remember that then then the next statement that brother bannon says is one that's been ringing in my ears i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst this is the one that's been rattling around in my mind in my spirit i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst we say we have the restored word but are we sufficiently impressed with the restored word do we value how do we value the restored word how much do we value the message amen not not to say i'm in the message or i believe the message but how much do we value the word that has come back amen amen we can we can in ourselves we can view the message as any other movement or any other uh uh revival or anything like that but but the message is christ the word that has come back to the people how much do we value the restoration of the word amen i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst and he goes on to give an example he says let me give you a thought here how do we pray we pray in jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer yet in first john 5 14 we are told this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desire of him so the state the scripture was that this is the comment that we have in him if we have anything if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and then brother brahm says now we ask what is the will of god there is only one way to know his will and that is by the word of god so the word is his will how do you pray his will pray the word and if we ask according to his will then he heareth us and if he hears us we have this confidence that he hears us and will answer how do we know that our answer because we asked according to the word then he goes on the lamentations 3 37 who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the lord commandeth it not there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask unless it's in his name there it is again jesus the name is the word his will so what's his name the word what's his will the word jesus his name is the word his will so when you ask in his will you ask in his name how do you know it's his will because of the word i'm asking according to the word it says you can't separate god in the word they are one amen that's why i i keep coming back to this question this statement what is the value of the word and the more i i look and meditate on this i i ask are we sufficiently impressed with the word that is in our midst i say we're impressed amen sometimes i feel sufficiently impressed but brother ben asked the question are we sufficiently impressed with the word that's in our midst because the word has brought back every it's brought back the potential of everything to us this word has brought back the potential of eden amen it's brought back the potential for everything we've lost this word has brought back and put within our grasp everything that has ever been taken away from us it's brought back in our fingertips within our reach it's brought back everything that man lost it's brought back the potential for a reversing of hybridization it's brought back amen this word is bringing back a faith that'll bring a rapture that'll change these atoms and change this body and glorify this physical body what's done it it's the word amen amen it's not fairy dust it's not a magic potion amen god brought back the word because there has to be a faith that's restored because the rapture is a revelation to the bride it's going to come as a revelation of the word praise be to god jesus made a simple statement in john 14 15. it's simple and i've passed over so many times reading it and we know it i mean it's probably a sunday school verse we learned years ago it says if you love me keep my commandments if you love me keep my commandments and in this statement we've seen the fallacy of the majority of christendom because every sunday saturday sunday or whatever day they worship they stand up and sing about how they're in love and a love affair with jesus christ and their songs have become so sensual and so saucy about this great love between jesus and themselves and the whole time they're trampling over all of his commandments amen not dressing like a woman not dressing like a man reversing the roles allowing women preachers baptizing in titles amen taking a tongue's initial evidence i mean on and on and on and on we can list the transgressions of his commandments and he says if you love me keep my commandments and it doesn't matter amen you're going to a denominational church amen and the songs are so emotionally charged about a love affair between jesus and i and i'm caught up and i'm swept away and your love is this and i mean it it is so saucy i mean but it's not true it's a lie it feels good it has a lot of emotion that goes with it and it's all about being swept away by his love and caught up in his embrace and so carried away in his love and this and that and that and don't have the simple audacity for a woman to put on a dress and let her hair grow long and says she loves jesus christ jesus says you don't is that right and we must be careful too that we don't take jesus commandments and limit them to the four gospels because the apostle paul came along and he gave some instructions to the church and he says if there's any spiritual among you who acknowledge that the things that i write unto you they are the commandments of the lord who's the lord jesus jesus if you let me keep my commandments paul says if you're spiritual you acknowledge that the things that i write unto you they are the commandments of the lord so that makes the preaching of paul the preaching of jesus makes it his commandments and i say the same thing in our day god has sent a servant in our day that represents himself amen and those commandments they're not brother brenham's ideas amen i believe they're the commandments of the lord but so many times people trivialize them and marginalize them as an opinion or or or that's not in the word or or this or that or so then you're saying that brother bannon was teaching the church things that aren't in the word so what kind of prophet do we have that'll give instruction to the church that's not part of the word when brother branham teaches us on marriage and divorce when he teaches us on interracial marriage when he teaches us on morality when he teaches us on dress when he teaches us on all of that if that's just his opinion and not the word then we have a prophet that'll put his opinion over the word we can leave it in denominations but but there's got to be a reality that says you know what i value what god has done in this age more than my own opinion i value it more than anything else and god help me where i've devalued it god help me where i've taken my own reasoning amen and sometimes we do it for years and we don't recognize it but all of a sudden the light bulb goes off and you say i've been trivializing that commandment i've taken it and marginalized it and i've taken it as the prophet's opinion or i've taken it this or i've taken it there and god forgive me for devaluing what you've done in this day you send a major prophet that can tap into the back part of your mind i mean you realize the places that the prophet of god has been he has been to the back part of god's mind to receive the mystery that's been hidden there from before the foundation of the world and he comes down and he's able to deliver the mystery that's been locked in the thoughts of jesus and the thoughts of god himself from before the beginning and this man doesn't have the credentials to tell me how to live my life what god wants what the nature of god is like what is appropriate inappropriate to please god i would say the man who has journeyed to the back part of the mind knows more about the nature of god than i and my trivial mind knows amen and i don't want to devalue what god has done in this day i want to surrender my whole life to it and say god hey you know what you say what if brother brennan was wrong what if he was wrong it's not my vindication that vindicated him it was god's vindication that vindicated him in a way that was far beyond anything that anybody could ever do or produce or do on their own amen god's the one who backed up what that prophet said god's the one who kept him on the straightener god's the one who corrected him when he was wrong and god's the one who had him come to the pulpit and rectify it so so i'm fine with that i'm comfortable with that if god was comfortable with it i'm comfortable with it amen if brother branham taught it and god didn't correct him i'm comfortable with it i'm comfortable enough to say amen anyway if we show up to heaven and we're standing there and says why did you do this and why did you do that i can say because your prophet said on such and such a tape this was the right way to do it because then it's not my fault anymore [Applause] do you understand that then i'm valuing what god has done i'm putting value where god put value and say you you realize that if we begin to marginalize statements and trivialize them and try to do our own placing and what was opinion and there's sometimes brother bam said no this is just my opinion that's fine that's his opinion he said it was but when other statements we try to marginalize and trivialize and make room for some of our own desires i said god help us never to do that again help me god to realize who you sent why you sent them what his message was what his ministry was for and that you called me under that message under that messenger under this message that's where you called me and that's my position and under the messenger we become the final voice to the final age under the messenger that's where god called me and i'm comfortable there god help me be more comfortable there that's my prayer i said god i i want to die to all my own desires and that's a much that's a simple statement to make but that's a hard thing to produce in life it's a daily dying it's a constant surrender and over and over we realize i've been transgressing i've been disrespectful there's there's things that i realize in my life i've been disrespecting the prophet for 10 years in this thing that i allow not because i wanted to but i was taking my own reasoning my own denominational spirit over what god has done in this day and now i have to come back and say god forgive me i am so sorry i'm so sorry that i could be so proud to think that i would have a better idea than the messenger that you sent to bring me to perfection so many times he says you're not to add one word or take one away and god help me not to add or take away help me to receive to believe to surrender to that's my that's my greatest desire amen i was talking to somebody i don't remember when a few weeks ago we're talking about people with different ideas in the message and if somebody can come to me with scriptures and quotes and a spiritual reason to believe why they believe in their taking from the message i'm fine with that even if i don't see it that way i don't feel like i have to see it that way but if i find that there that they're drawing their inspiration from their message and they're drawing it from the scriptures and they have they gave reasons to believe this scripture and this these quotes i say praise god they're trying to stay with the message i'm over here doing the same thing we may differ on opinion god can correct that later he can bring a revelation that takes these two things and hems them together i'm not going to discount him because he's staying in the message don't discount me i'm staying in the message too i believe this because the prophet said it i believe it because i see it in the scriptures i believe it because of these principles amen it doesn't mean i believe it perfectly but i believe it because i'm under my messenger and if you're the same place then god bless you for staying with the message and we believe that whatever we're not seeing right god will adjust the goggles and we'll take these two things and bring them right together i don't want to discount somebody amen when they're staying with the scriptures staying with the quotes as long as they won't discount me for that either i have a great even if i disagree there's brothers i love dearly there's things i disagree with them more amen but i respect them highly for taking their inspiration from the message not from internet preachers or other sources but i respect him highly for taking their inspiration from the message if i don't if i can't quite click with that thought that's okay if he'll stay with the message and i'll stay with the message it's all going to be okay anyways what i can't handle is adding two or taking away from that's what i can't go along with amen in the third seal 1963 the third seal brother graham says now we notice that god told eve that after so long the time the word is coming back to you now how did she fall i want my class to say it what did she fall from what did eve fall from the word what did he fall from the word how will we ever get back to where eve was without the word he fell from the word there's no way to get back to that position without the word if it's not for the word coming and full manifestation in this day to bring us back to eating condition all we have is another church age all we have is another message bringing us into another church age waiting for the one that will bring the word to bring us back to eden so if we've received anything less than the perfect word of god that will restore us back to an even condition all we've received is another church age but what we've received is the finishing of the church age because the words come back and when the word come back all that was necessary to go back to eden has been restored what did she fall from the word is that right the word and god said he'd make a way to redeem her back to the word again all right after so long a time the the word would be known to her all right the the word would come for one purpose now i love this eve received a promise that promise was thy seed thy seed shall bruise the serpent's head and that was the word was that seed the word a seed was jesus christ the word and so she was promised that the word would return to you that's what the promise is thy seed she was promised a seed and that seed was the word of god and she was promised you fell from the word but someday the word will come back to you amen and god said he'd make a way to redeem her back to the word again all right the word would come for one purpose now hold tight now what i'm saying the word would come to her for one purpose that was for redemption all right but until then she had a substitute that that would work until the time arrived for the original word so now he's referring to eve as the type of the jewish bride the hebrew bride the old testament church now he's saying there was a promise given to her that the word will come back to you in the meantime you're given a substitute and that's the law and that's the sacrifices and so now he says you're given a substitute for the blood now the blood was of bulls and sheep and goats and things but it didn't take away her sins see it only covered her sin it didn't take away at all it covered it for it was an animal's blood and then the animal's blood is animal life it was a substitute until the real now get your coats on the real human blood as human beings would be become incarnate god without sex virgin the virgin birth produced that now god's word promised became blood and was incarnate in the person of jesus christ the savior god's word that he promised became blood that's why brother brown said the word bled for you the word died for you the word came back to her and when the word came back to her that word paid the price for her and that word came back to her for the purpose of redeeming her back to her position further down in the third seal he says god promised the spiritual eve as as same as he did natural eve that again the word would be restored to her so what he did for eve naturally he's done for eve spiritual so he's told the church the word would come back to her too what for for redemption in the last days he would restore to the church the original word again now watch real close i want you to be sure now god promised eve that the time would come when the word would be restored by her seed this word itself would become seed you say and he gave her a substitute and she held that substitute and when the word came to her what what did she do i don't want it it was too humble didn't look right to her wasn't polished enough a stable oh my a guy like that not a day in school i wouldn't accept that that's no messiah a guy let guys kick him around like that and then call it messiah let them put a rag around his face and hit him on the head he called himself a prophet a real prophet raised up after them they didn't know prophets jesus said so he said if you would have known the prophet you'd have known me is that right now notice but when the word came to her the way just exactly the way god said it would come she had it figured out some other way i'm talking about the bride the jewish bride the hebrew bride that was eve to begin with then when it come out here she didn't want it she wanted to stay with her substitute now god promised spiritual eve at pentecost told her even before it happened 400 years before the church ever fell that they would fall away and they would do what they've done but he promised in the last days he'd send the word again so the promise that eve received this spiritual eve has received the same promise the word will come back to you for what reason for redemption what's the day that we live and we live in the day that the word has come back the word has come back for what reason for redemption to bring us back to all that we fell from to bring us back into an eaten condition and that's why i say we can't value this word enough it's going to be this word that brings us back not our own idea not our efforts not anything it's going to be this word that's going to restore amen and brother ben said all the way back in pentecost he he promised that there would be the word restored and so let's look at this in the book of acts chapter three because brother bram said several times that from the beginning he knew they would fall away and he told the church at pentecost that he would restore look at acts chapter 3 verse 19 acts chapter 3 verse 19. peter is now preaching it says repent you therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord and he shall send jesus christ which before which preached unto you whom the heaven must receive until the time of restitution of all things which god has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began right in the beginning he says there's going to be a restitution of all things brother branham said at the very beginning of pentecost he told him the word's going to come back to you he goes on to say in the third seal he says now that's what's the that's what's the reason today the revivals that we're supposed to have we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring no no no no no sir don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they've got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a revival nowhere no brother branham now is he's giving us a good definition he's giving us a clear understanding he says they're talking about revivals amen and in his day they were trying to revive the azusa street revival the the outpouring of the gifts from 1906 and they were looking for that kind of revival that that there would be a pentecostal revival again and brother branham says there hasn't been a revival amen there hasn't been a stirring yet we've had millions and millions but no revival yet so what is revival revival then is not a crowd revival is not a week-long sermon we're not revival it's not an avengers in the pulpit none of that is revival because brother brown the pentecostals had all of that amen they enduring those revivals they would have manifestations they would have enthusiasm they would have good preaching they would have ecstatic worship they would have but brother bam said none of that's a revival yet here's what he goes on to say the bride hasn't had a revival yet there's been no revival there no manifestation of god disturbed the bride yet so that means all of those things that through the 50s and 60s they were calling revivals weren't revivals that would stir the bride and he said there's been no revival there no manifestation of god to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it it'll take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it brother now is bringing some clarity to the pentecostals in that day and he even begins and we'll read a quote in a minute he even as good friends as saying revival in our time revival in our time we'll read that quote next and he says but but that's there's been no revival there's been no revival for the bride there's been no stirring of the bride there's been no manifestation of god to wake her up yet although there's been all kinds of exciting things take place even in brother bannon's ministry there was exciting exciting things that took place but nothing to wake up the bride yet first and second paul didn't wake her up it attracted her attention but didn't wake her up amen there had to come something and brother venom said it'll take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again what is those seven thunders a revelation of the word there's a mystery in the word that has to come and when the word comes it'll wake her up that's the revival she's waiting for amen not a revival of a stirring not a revival of noise not a revival of a crowd not a week-long services she was waiting for the word to come back and when the word came back that's what would bring the bride back the word is everything friends he goes on and that was the third seal he preached in march of 1963 and here we come to july of 1964 recognizing your day and its message said everywhere now there's no revival everybody's complaining ministers crying i was reading one of the outstanding papers that comes here to the church a very fine paper and i know the editor i know the people and they're godly people very fine brother and sister more of the herald of his coming one of the finest papers on the field herald of his coming but they hardly will print anything unless it's about fast pray fast praise sound of trump and how many reads it you know you see it all the time fast pray fast praise all you hear fast pray we're going to have a great breaking of the day there is a great thing going to happen all you pray pray pray we're not too late yet why do they do that why do they do that they want a great awakening they're crying believing that there will be an awakening they're good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized the awakening of the bride brother branham said in 1963 during the seals the third seal there's been no manifestation of god to wake the bride yet and now in 1960 but he says it'll take those seven unknown thunders that'll do it it'll take those seven unknown thunders to wake her up again then in 1964 in july he says why are they crying for revival they feel something they don't know what it is he says they haven't recognized the awakening of the bride so between march of 1963 and 1964 there has been a manifestation of god to wake up the bride and what was it it was the preaching of the seven thunders it was the revelation of the mysteries and the seven seals he says by being a christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel the way they know something is supposed to happen but see they're looking for it way far in the future to come when it's already happening right by you brother ben i'm saying it's happening right by you amen and you can feel in yourself you can say i need a revival i need a fresh outpouring i need a revival amen what you need is the word amen the word will bring a fresh revival the word will bring a freshening to your experience what you need amen is the word and the line up to the word and let the word have preeminence because the word brings the awakening the word brings the revelation the word brings the life amen i ask you i'll ask you another question if we have enthusiasm excitement without the word what do we have but let's get excited about the word amen let's be enthusiastic about god has sent us something i don't have to look i have it it's in my hand i'm not hunting i'm not fishing i'm not waiting amen my everything i need god has delivered to me and the message the message to unlock the word the word is open amen i may not see it all like i want but i have it it's in my hands i've got the potential here amen we should be so enthused and so excited about that everything i have need of amen lays within me and it's unlocked by the word that's coming to me the revelation unlocks the potential within we're not waiting for another age we're not waiting for another ministry we're not waiting for more books to be printed we've got everything we need amen to unlock the potential to go back to eden to reverse the curse to end hybridization it's all been given to us how much can we overvalue this message never can we overvalue the word has been given to us never brother bam says in the uh in 1962 in december is this the sign of the answer he says the seven thunders right in the revelation here of jesus christ is some mystery does not the bible say this the revelation of jesus christ why there is some hidden mystery then of it what is it the seven thunders have it for john was just about to write and the voice come down from heaven said don't write it but seal it seal it up put it on the back side of the book it's got to be revealed it's the mysteries so the the seven thunders have it and the first seal he says then along come the pentecostal age with the baptism of the holy spirit and they cabbage down on that now there cannot be no more ages that's all of it that's the philadelphia are not the laodicea age we found in the study of the scripture that the messenger to the age came right at the end of of the age every time paul came at the end of the age we find out that irenaeus came at the end of the age martin at the end of the age luther at the end of the of the catholic age and what wesley at the end of the lutheran age and pentecost at the end of the age of sanctification through the baptism of the holy ghost and at the end of the pentecostal age we are supposed to receive according to the word as god help me tonight to show you through here that we are to receive a messenger that will take all these loose ends there and reveal the whole secret of god for the rapturing of the church and then there's coming forth seven mysterious thunders that's not even written at all that's right and i believe that through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it there's something we've got to step farther we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly we have got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment and be swept up out of this earth and we find that after a while the lord willing we find where it's written he said it's going to take amen those seven thunders that got to be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together there was something that god was holding in the back part of his mind something that he had to get so he could finally reverse everything that was done when the first woman left the word and then she left her mate she brought death she left christ amen but there's got to be something come at the end time that will bring it all back again amen and what did she leave the word what will be restored the word what is the contained in those seven thunders the revelation of jesus christ the mystery of god has come back to the people to understand what's been going on all along where we come from where we're going to what god's plan of redemption is being to build in us of faith amen to bring us to rapturing faith to reverse what was done it was fallen by it was kept by the word fell by the word will be restored by the word amen that's why romans 10 17 says so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god how can we have faith to reverse the curse in eden until the word comes that will reverse the curse in eden the revelation the mystery in the back part of god's mind has to be delivered amen and with faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word so if i need if it's going to be faith a revelation faith to change this mortal and if it's going to be faith and faith come by hearing the word how much should we be hearing the word that brings this kind of faith what word brings this kind of faith it was the mysteries amen it was what was preached in the seals and afterwards what was that message of the uh the message of the messenger amen it was this mystery that was laying under those seals to do what to bring a word that will bring this kind of faith that's where my attention should be that's where my devotion should be that's what i should be surrendered to in 1964 in questions and answers i'm just going to lay this in here a question came have the seven thunders which equals seven mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the seven seals but are yet but are yet not known to us as the thunders yet it was a good question back in that day because brother branham preceding coming up to this time was saying those seven thunders will bring rapturing faith there's a mystery lies in the seven thunders amen we're restoring and he's telling all of this and now they're asking amen well well what were the seven thunders are they are the equal seven mysteries already been revealed are they this uh were they revealed in the seven seals but are yet not known to us as the thunders yet he says no they were revealed in the seven seals that's what the thunders was about so don't put this in the future it's already been given don't look for something else it's in our hands don't look for something else to come we already have it friends he said the seven thunders that had uttered their voices and no one could make out what it was john knew what it was but he was forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven mysteries of the seven thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seventh church age known as william marion branham are we looking for something or do we have it how much value can we put on what we have and the seventh seal he says i had my hands out he's talking about being up in sabino canyon he's up at pulpit rock and he's praying god woke him up that morning and told him to go up to sabine he took a tablet of paper in his bible and he went up to sabine and he climbs up to where pulpit rock is he's got my hands out and all at once something hit my hand i don't know i can't say did i go to sleep i don't know did i go into a trance i don't know was it a vision i can't tell you only thing i can say is just the same thing like them angels was getting picked up in the constellation angels and this was the same thing and it struck my hand and i looked and it was a sword and had a pearl handles real pretty had a guard over it with gold and the blade looked like something like chrome like silver only it was real shiny and it was so feather edge sharp oh my and i thought isn't that the prettiest thing just fit my hand i thought that all that's awful pretty but i said hey i'm always afraid of them things of sword and i thought what will i do with that and just then a voice shook down through there that rocked the rock said it's the sword of the king and then i come out of it the sword of the king now if it said any sort of a king but it said the sword of the king there's only one the king and that's god and he has one sword that's his word what i live by that so help me god standing over this holy desk here with this holy word laying here it is the word amen what was put in this hand the word what word that word that laid under those mysterious seven thunders the revelation of the seven seals that word was put in the prophet's hand it's the king's sword which is the word the word was put in his hand and it was delivered out to us and he said so help me god it's the word what are we looking for we already have it it's the word oh what a day we're living in what a great thing so the mystery and the secret standing there when this left me something just come to me and said don't fear now i didn't hear no voice like on the inside of me spoke i have to just tell you the truth just exactly what happened something hit said don't fear this is that third pool what is the third pool the third pole is the pool that gets the rainbow trout the covenant fish into the king that catches the fish what catches them it's the word what brings us back the word what restores us the word what gives us rapturing faith the word what is it the word do we value the word enough and i'm going to say for myself no but i want to but all my heart i want this word i don't know how i don't know i don't know what to do i don't know what to change but but this word i see it as everything i see the word that's been given to us is the solution that's what we were talking about wednesday night after brother abraham brother marcus priest i got up and it just struck me the solution the answer to the devil's question is this word the the the solution to every problem is this word what's your problem the word that we've been given is the answer what do you have need of it lays in the word what are you going to pray for it comes from the word where does faith to apprehend something come from from the word from a revelation upon the word you get faith to apprehend what's laying in the word it's all the word the word the word and the word is not left off in this age the word has been restored in this age and it's not missing pieces even that part which wasn't written in the bible amen that john was forbidden the right that part has been given back to our hand no other generation has had that peace they could look and read and say something uttered from heaven something was spoke it thundered there was a voice of god something was spoken there's another word amen but it wasn't recorded nobody has had what those thunders were until this day we have been given the missing piece of the word the full word has been brought back there's nothing else we need but to stay with this word and give everything to it let's not wait for anything else let's take all of our life and focus it on this word all of our affections all of our efforts all of our time and attention let's focus it on this word and let's surrender to the word that's been given to us i i don't know about you but i'm tired of myself tired of my own hindrances and i'm tired of my own distractions and i'm tired of my own emotions i'm tired of my own weariness i'm tired of my own my own desire to play and my own frivolities i'm tired of it all what i want is to see this word manifest what it was sent for amen i'm ready for a body change i'm ready for the reversing of the fall of eve i'm ready for the millennium i want it i want it with everything that's in me god help me get past this flesh and dig into this word and surrender everything to this word i'm tired of this hybridization i'm tired of a fallen mind i'm tired of wrong desires what i want is for this word to have preeminence in my life i want to surrender more i want to give more i want to give it more first place i want to heed more to this word i think that's what he's looking for because the great threefold plan of god unfolded in three folds and the first fold was accomplished in jesus christ when he got preeminence and a man and what kind of premise that he had jesus only did that which the father showed him but the second fold is to get pre-eminence in a people and that's what he's doing now through you and i how much premise does he want the same amount that he had in jesus christ and and the one thing about preeminence is even with jesus christ god never took it jesus had to give it jesus had to give him preeminence he was allowed to make his choice he was allowed to wrestle it out amen in gethsemane brother bannon said he did not have to go to calvary he chose to go to calvary he was given as a flesh being he was given room to make his choice god never took preeminence jesus gave him preeminence and god will never take preeminence in the bride amen until first of god the bride gives him preeminence and when she gives him preeminence he'll take his place in the bride i said god i want to give you more preeminence i think the best thing that could ever happen to us the best thing is we all lost our jobs and they shut down the church and we had to get on our face before god night and day and nothing else mattered and we didn't care about anything else and nothing else distracted us it'd probably be the best thing that ever happened to us do you agree now i'm not asking for that to happen i don't want them but what i want is i want to come so alive to what god's given me that i begin to give him that now amen i begin to give him that on a daily basis that it's not a treasury for me to wake up early and go seek his face because i want that more than i want what a half hour of sleep god help me how many times have i sacrificed a half an hour sleep for communion with the lord i'd be ashamed to tell you how many times but i tell you i have no desire for that inside in the inner man i i want to bring this outer man into subjection and say i'm tired of you running the show there's something deeper inside i want him to have preeminence i want him to have first place i want him to have my best hours i want him to have my my undivided attention i want him to have my life amen i think that's the bride that he's looking for job said in job 23 let's turn and look at this scripture together job 23. job chapter 23 and i'm going to begin with verse 8. behold i go forward but he's not there and backward but i cannot perceive him on the left hand where he does work but i cannot behold him he hideth himself from the right hand that i cannot see him but he knoweth the way that i take and when he hath tried me i shall come forth this gold my foot hath held his steps his way have i kept and not declined neither have i gone back from the commandment of his lips i have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food i want to put this little statement into perspective job's in the midst of a trial everything's going wrong in his life and he doesn't understand why things are going wrong in his life and he makes this statement he says he says behold i go forward but he's not there. he said i can't find god in my trial i don't know where he's at i go forward but he's not there backward but i cannot perceive him i don't know what god's doing i don't know where god is i don't know what's happening and i don't know how to find out do you understand are we on the same page this is job's mentality on the left hand where he does work but i cannot behold him he hides himself on the right hand that i cannot see him he said i don't know but then he says something he does know but he knoweth the way that i take i don't know where he's at but he knows where i'm at he knows the way that i take and when he hath tried me i shall come forth as gold what a bold statement for a man to make i don't know where he's at i don't know where he's hiding i don't know what he's doing but he knows the way that i'm taking and when he has tried me i shall come forth as gold and why can job make a statement like that let's keep reading because he says my foot hath held his steps i did what his word said do my foot i thought of steps his way have i kept and not declined neither have i gone back from the commandment of his lips i have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food look at job's attitude towards the word of god he said i gave him first place i went in his way i have not declined from his commandment i i have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food i have given him first place and i have obeyed him i have no idea what he's doing but he knows the way that i take him when he's tried me i shall come forth this goal because i did what he told me to do i stayed in his commandment i obeyed his word there's no other outcome but perfection we don't always understand what's going on in our lives and we we may not be able to comprehend this that or the other but one thing amen let's get to a place where he says i don't know why this is happening to my family but i have done what he said do and i know it's going to work out for good and i know that we shall come forth this goal i don't know why this trial has come i don't know this or that i prayed and god has not revealed to me where i've transgressed any of his commandments as far as i know i've obeyed everything that the prophet taught and i've stayed with the word as much as i know and i know that this trial when it's over i shall come forth as gold because i stayed with the word we can have confidence not in ourselves but confidence in the word job wasn't looking at himself job was looking at the commandment he kept i did what he said and i didn't decline i didn't step away but i did what he told me and that's why he could be so bold in his statement and the first seal brother brahman says now notice in the same time this is going on just before this takes place rather on the earth god has promised while all them scruples up with denominations arguing their differences about their creed god promised that he would send us a true prophet of the true word with a message to return the original word of god and the faith of the fathers to bring down the power of the holy ghost amongst the people what did the message do it brought the power of the holy ghost amongst the people and what does the power do that's what he says next with a power that'll raise her above all these things what things all the denominational things and all the carnal things and all the worldly things what does the power of the holy ghost do first it raises her above all of these denominational things and take her in at the same time to raise her above the denominations and take her in to the marriage supper that's what the power of the holy ghost came down to do when was it unleashed when the word was restored what other power do we want except the power to rise above all the carnal things and to go into the marriage supper that's the power that i want and that's the power that's been given it's with the word he said in the message in the invisible union and when the life comes out of that denomination goes into the grain then what happens when the grain begins to grow and to get bigger so that it can cover over something the denomination pulls away from it why ain't we got a denomination out of this they never will be it's the grain it can't go no farther we're at the end time so what does it have to do now lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened that's exact the word to be ripened into your hearts to bring forth and live what we're talking about what's the last stage uh we know that as we've been talking and as we've been preaching today that god had established everything in eden upon his word and it was held in perfection by the word of god but one deviation from one word brought a ruination of everything because everything was held in place by the word and when when eve left the word she left christ judgment came everything fell so god has got to bring back a word and he's promised to the end time gentile bride that the word would be restored again and what would the word do the word would come back and bring rapturing faith amen to finish the cycle of redemption what does the word come back for for redemption what will finish redemption when all the seed are gathered back home everything has come back the word has come back it's here god is not going to send another prophet he sent the prophet there's not another seventh angel there's only one seventh angel and he sent that seventh angel there's not another seven thunders to be revealed the seven thunders have already been revealed what are we looking for what's the last phase the last phase is for us who's received the word to stay in the presence of this light to bake out all the immaturity to bring us into the perfect image of the word that's been restored to reflect back the full life of jesus christ by what by staying in the presence of the son not another message not another great revelation not a new doctrine not new books not another church not a move not another revival the bride's already been awakened why do we need to wake her again don't need another revival don't need another push we don't need to turn another corner we've already turned the last corner we don't need anything else we need to take what's been given and give our whole life to it and surrender and come completely under it and completely into it and not do like eve did not do like the jewish church did not do like the first gentile church did but there's got to be a church that's different this time a church that will take what's been given and stick with it until it produces what it's promised to produce every one of those other churches and brides they would have produced what the word said if they would have stayed with the word just a little bit longer but they all stopped too short but i'm so glad there's a promise in the day that there's a bride that will not fall she's predestinated not to i believe that's me i believe that's you so what do i do lay in the presence of the sun well how do you blame the presence of the sun not running all over god's creation playing around with all your time but laying in the presence of son is to stay under this word stay plugged in keep feeding on it stay in fellowship stay in service keep reading keep feeding keep staying under this life until it keeps baking out all the greenness all the greenness all the greenness amen we're not waiting for anything else it's already here all we're doing is waiting for it to mature within us and it's not going to happen until we give it first place brother bannon was talking about going beyond the curtain of time and he talked about you know you know he had a hard time describing he said it was perfection it was beyond perfection he said there's not enough words in the english language to describe it it was it was perfect love the only thing i'll enter in there is perfect love it's the realm of the word it's so many things we can use to describe it but brother branham could never accurately describe that but he said those people would run up to him and say my precious brother and and they would hug his neck and there was perfect love there and brother branham was set remember in the vision in the dream or the vision he was set up on a pillar and he said what are you doing this he said because on earth you were a leader and and so in that realm he's still the leader over there he's still the one that they're all under that's important to realize and and he begins to he begins to talk about the feeling and the people and the genuine sisters and genuine brothers and the genuine love and all of that and then he starts to talk about this ripening into perfection and receiving the word and laying in the presence of the sun and then to bake all the greenness out to come into the perfect image and then it refers back to that going beyond the current of time and he says before we leave before before this happens talking about the going away the bride he said i think it'll be something like it was over there i believe it'll be something like it was over there when he makes a statement like that i say god bake the greenness out of me bake the greenness out of me what was it like over there there was love perfect love it was a realm of the perfect word and they all over there had perfect faith brother branham was exalted in their midst they the men grabbed him and put him up on the pedestal they were happy that he was the head they were happy to be under his ministry and then when he asked the angel can i see jesus and he says he'll come to you first and judge you amen and and then they told they told brother we'll be judged with you and they were happy with that they were happy for him to be the head and for they exalted him to the head and for them to be judged underneath of him and then brother ben said i preached what paul preached and they all said we're resting on that and brother branham said i think it'll be here something like it was over there just before the rapture i said god let it be that way in my heart where i'm happy he's the head i exalt him to his position it was the brothers who picked him up and put him on that pedestal let me now put him on that pedestal so that here it's something like it was there let us live in perfect love for one another to appreciate one another and call one another precious brother let's make it here something like it was over there and let's be happy that he'll be judged first and will be found in his judgment if he passes we pass i don't have some side venture going where if the prophet was a little wrong here i you know i've already told god i don't exactly believe it that way i really got it lined up with the word over here that's not how it was there nobody there was correcting him nobody there had another idea they put him on the pedestal and they were happy to be judged they said he'll come and judge you and we'll be judged with you he said before the rapture it'll be something here like it was there what'll bring that perfect love this kind of attitude when when god's word is respected when his way is respected when his prophets respected when the word has been restored is respected when the believers together respect one another and live in harmony under that prophet amen and when he says you'll be will be judged with you they're fine with that i'll be judged with him but what if he's wrong then if he's wrong and god was the one who vindicated him if he was wrong all i will say is god i just believe what you've indicated [Music] i don't need to start hedging against the day that brother ben's wrong if that attitude's anywhere in your mind he was a little awful in this and maybe off on that and i've got maybe my little own idea on that then it's not here for you like it was over there you're not ready for the rapture we don't need our own little ideas and hedging against the possibility that he was wrong in this document wrong in that doctrine amen we're judged under him when he passes judgment we pass judgment so i'm going to stay here under that headship i have no desire to correct him none none whatsoever if i correct the prophet then somehow i'm equal to or above the prophet and i don't want to be in that position i don't want to bear that responsibility i want nothing to do with that i want to be the one who lifts him up on the pedestal carries him on my shoulder praise god you're the prophet of the age and i'm so happy that he's going to come and judge you first and i'll be judged with you because that prophet said i preached what paul preached and i believe that with all my heart and i'm resting on that here because i was resting on it there because brother branham come and he was speaking to a congregation and he said i saw all of you over there i believe i was over there and i already said i'm resting on that i've already put him on the pedestal i'm already ready to be judged under him and i'm already resting in the fact he preached a pure word and brother benham said i believe before the rapture it'll be here something like it was over there i said friends let's make it here like it was over there let's just surrender to what god gave us let's put good value on the word let's stop playing around with our little entertainments and then our little selfish desires and running after the world here and there and our own ideas and division on doctrine and whatever is holding us back little fashion things and entertainment and movies and disney stuff and let's just start dropping all of that stuff and make it over here something like it was over there let's surrender more more can you ever surrender too much for the word can you give up too much for the word can you show the word too much respect no the word is god can you surrender too much give up too much no you can't surrender too much for the word say god help me to surrender all because i'm safe under that word i want it to be in my heart today something like it was over there when brother ben went beyond the curtain of time i want on my shoulders to lift that prophet to that pedestal do you want to lift him lift him in your life in your heart today put him on the pedestal lift him up above the rest of the congregation lift him up above every other man and every other man's idea and every other minister and everything else why don't why don't us as brothers and sisters today carry him on our shoulders and let's put him on the pedestal so it'll be something here like it was over there let's be content saying he'll be judged and i'll be judged with him if he's found all right i'm found all right because i obeyed what he said and i'm content saying i'm resting on the fact that he preached what paul preached this isn't a halfway message this isn't a 95 accurate message we're not dealing with a close call or the best next thing we're dealing with the perfect message the perfect word with perfection was the man perfect no the mistake sure he confessed that he told it but i'm talking about the word that was brought the doctrines that were preached the things that were taught to the church was the perfect word for us to live by to surrender to the the the attach our soul destination to that's what god has given us in this day and he said i believe that it'll be something here before the rapture to be something here like it was over there and i say i believe it because in my heart it's already coming it's already stirring let there be perfect love by perfect faith and a perfect word if there's any little thing in our hearts that has us concerned about the word that has us concerned about whether the prophet was right or not listen if there's a question or a concern it'll never be here like it was over there over there they didn't doubt his ministry they had no questions to whether he was right or not they weren't worried about if he had gotten this wrong or that wrong they were content that he was the messenger of the age and they were under him perfectly content if there's a question in your heart a concern about the doctrine about the teaching about the life i i admonish you with all that's in me get on your face and ask god to bring a revelation don't stay in that in between state it's not going to work it won't work you'll fall away somewhere you'll come into a dead end you'll hit a wreck somewhere you're not going to stay much longer in that in between state because we're coming fast to the rapture and it'll be something here like it was there if you're not confident that god sent the seventh angel and that seventh angel was manifest and william mariam branham and that the preaching of the seventh the mystery the seven thunders was preached and delivered to the bride that the word was restored to perfection with the perfect interpretation the word with divine vindication if you're not sure of that it's time to get on your face say god i need a deeper revelation than what i have because this isn't another church age there's another movement we're not waiting for another revival we're not waiting this is it if this ain't it there's nothing else is it this is it it's got to be all of it it can't be part of it it's not 98 it's either it or it's not it there's no time for another age there's no time for another messenger it's it it's got to be it in your heart it can't be it just with everybody else around you you can't be moving with the flow amen god's going to make sure that you can't stay in the flow nobody else is going to carry you along you've got to have here what they had over there i say get on your face until you say i believe with all my heart this is the only way and i'm giving all of myself to this and when you do you'll find that everything we have need of is in this word everything everything we need to overcome laodicea everything we need for a body change everything we need for perfect love everything we need for more faith it's in this word that's been given to us it's in our hands let's give ourselves completely to it let's surrender like we've never surrendered before let's love his word like we've never loved it before let's sacrifice everything else for it and quit sacrificing the word for everything else let's give up other things to let this word have preeminence in our lives because it's the solution for the end time condition it's the solution for all of time's condition it's the only solution it is the fix it is the repair job it is the restitution of all things it is the restoration of the word it is redemption come to fullness there's nothing else let's just give ourselves to this god bless you as we stand musicians if you'll come brother john if you'll make your way up amen whenever i have time to stop and meditate these are where my meditations go that this message has got to be everything god didn't do such a mighty work and mighty manifestation to get us to halfway surrender to the word god didn't move nations god didn't move circumstances god didn't i mean think about god didn't allow a pillar of fire to be the only picture on a roll of film that came out for nothing god didn't send a cloud 37 miles high in arizona to be have pictures taken of it 28 minutes before sunset so it was visible for about half an hour before sunset and he didn't he didn't do that amen while a meteorologist and atmospheric scientist was watching for nothing god didn't record it and send it in life magazine and all over the world for nothing you understand what i'm saying god didn't give us this message the way he gave it for nothing he gave it to us the way he gave it to us for us to give it everything we can't take it lightly or trivial and i'm afraid in myself there's times i take it too lightly there's times i don't put enough gravity enough weight in it but i say god help me i want to give it all because this is my my only hope this message has been given to us it's my only hope explain to me your plan b meet me after church and tell me what what you got as a backup plan there is none this is it and i say the faster i can surrender to it the better it's going to be for me the more that i can give it first place listen this word didn't come to disrupt our lives amen it come to kill us so that it can give us eternal life so that we can come into real life it come to destroy everything that was not the word so that the word could flourish in our lives it didn't come to take away our fun it gave it it came to give us the most peace the most joy the most rest that we've ever had in our lives it didn't come amen to hamper our lives it came to bring us into life we've got to have the right attitude towards it if we put the right attitude towards it we get the right results from it let's bow our heads and pray dear heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for your word oh god what can we say in the face of your perfect word lord what all of time has been waiting for is for a restoration of the word lord before the foundation of the world you had a mystery in the back part of your mind and you knew exactly when that you would unveil that mystery you knew the date you knew the vessel that you would use you knew how you would do it in the circumstances surrounding it you knew how you would vindicate it when you were writing your bible you made sure the scriptures were there that would point to it to show where it is you brought the the manifestation you brought the sign in the sky you brought the prophet on the scene you brought the vindication you knew when it would happen you knew what day we would be here not only that you brought me here lord in this day to benefit from that word god you saw fit to ordain me and my brothers and sisters that are here to be alive in this hour when you've done such a work and you knew what you would do before the fall because you were the lamb slain from before the foundation of the world you knew how you would redeem you knew what method you would take in redemption you knew that you would have a gentile bride of your own choosing you knew about the falling away you knew about the restoration of the bride tree you laid it in job's prophecy and joel's prophecy of the of the canker worm and the caterpillar but you said i will restore you knew it before you've brought us to the hour of fulfillment you've brought us to the moment in time then you would reverse that curse that you would destroy the works of the devil and you brought up people and were part of that people that you would use amen to destroy the works of the devil and you brought a word that will accomplish it all and you've unlocked a faith lord that can attain it all god how can we not give you our lives how can we not surrender all forgive us father oh god forgive us forgive us for our spiritual laziness forgive us for our distractions forgive us for our selfish desires and our lusts forgive us lord and wash that away from us and help us to give you everything god we believe this is the hour for all of these things to be made manifest we're living in the time lord when you're going to take these vessels of clay that you've predestinated not to fall and you're going to accomplish what you've not been able to accomplish through the bride type before you will do it in this hour all you're looking for is preeminent somebody that will surrender and say god help me to be that vessel that'll surrender oh and i want to give it all to you i surrender to you lord take this vessel and use it for your glory now god i want to take your word above my necessary food i want to value this message that you've given over every other idea or concept i want to place the appropriate value in the appropriate place help me father god we surrender ourselves afresh to you take these people lord take your children lord into your hands as they surrender take them up lord draw them near to yourself and whisper your love secrets in their ears strengthen us lord as we lay in your presence bake all the greenness out of us and bring us to a full harvest maturity may we reflect this word that we've received may it reflect out of us as we mature god it wasn't just for us to hear but this message is for us to live come live it through us oh god as we surrender to you we love you father we ask that you would bless us help us as a people to stay in the right way help us as a congregation to stay surrendered to your word help us as a believing assembly to stay under our prophet messenger to put him on the pedestal where he belongs and surrender ourselves to that ministry that you've given to us in the end time let us stay true to the word that's been given to us as an assembly may we walk the way you've called us to walk and taught us to walk forgive us for our failures forgive us for our stumblings but give us strength by the power that came down with the word to rise above all of these things and be swept on in that's what we're asking for father help it accomplish your word and purpose in us we pray in jesus christ's name amen man god bless you brother john listen oh i know the time is near where everything that i hold dear lay before the holy consuming fire all my works in all my deeds and every prayer set on my knees will lay before the holy consuming fire all i want to see is jesus [Music] all i want to see him in me all i want to see is jesus shine through me and hurt and self-inflicted pain everything i thought was gay words of knowledge in his name healing hands that [Music] is [Music] all i want to see jesus shining through me and hear him say my [Applause] my faith all i want to see is jesus all i want to see is [Music] all i want to see is jesus [Music] amen god bless you all man i sometimes it's just so hard not to just get so serious and sincere i don't mean ever to be hard or to be whatever it is i am but when you think about what god's done when you think about the age we live in and the manifestation we've had and what god wants to accomplish [Music] listen there's no room for playing games and i sometimes i feel it stronger than others but sometimes i meditate and i think this is the hour this is the day this is what the whole world has been building up to this is the purpose for calvary this is why the blood was shed this is why i mean there's been seven church ages this is why a prophet it's it's all hinged on this moment in time and god has done so much to bring his plan of redemption to this time can we value it enough can we give enough to it can we bow enough pray there's nothing we can do enough all we can do is just give up and say god i i'm not even going to try to use my own mind i'm not even going to try to manipulate but i'm just going to say yea lord whatever you say let it be that way what did you say i should act like let it be that way however way you should say i should dress let it be that way however you say we should structure ourselves yea lord i don't know what else to do but say let it be that way it's it's serious but i believe when we when we get to the other side if there is any conversations like this i don't know if anybody says oh you came in the bright age you came out at the end oh how did you do it and we'll just be the we'll be saying i was predestinated not to fall it wasn't what i did it's what i surrendered myself to that he did through me it's the same thing that brother branham could say i was just standing near when he did it it's not the the seventh angel it was the mighty angel it was it was not a son of man it was the son of man amen it wasn't me he predestinated me it wasn't because i was great it's because he said i come at a time that i wouldn't fall he predestinated me not to fall it's all him not me [Music] and we recognize that let's just give ourselves to him sometimes we come across things in the message we don't understand why does it matter so much why does our family have to be structured this way why can a woman not wear this and do that and i said god bring me to a level of maturity where i can get beyond all those questions and say be it unto me according to your word if that's what you wanted and if that's what your prophet of the age said that's the way it's going to be because i believe have confidence in what god has done in this hour i want to surrender more god help me you pray for me and i'll pray for you that god can have his way sometimes i just sit back and i i meditate i think what would it be like if we were all able to give him absolute preeminence and obey perfectly the word on everything in our lives i think we would be shocked at what we would see but that's what we're coming to that's what he's bringing us that's what he's growing us to that's why we're laying in the presence of the sun so that he has absolute control i think it's going to be shocking the things that we'll see not when we get stronger smarter better louder but when we completely surrender to everything he said i think we'll see amazing things take place in our life that's my desire i believe it's yours god bless you as we dismiss and we go to fellowship i pray that the fellowship's a blessing to you may we fellowship on these things the bible tells us to provoke one another to love into good works to encourage one another to stay in the word to manifest the word to surrender to the word a stay in fellowship on these things may god bless us as we have this time together amen let's just ask god's blessing over the fellowship lord jesus we thank you that we have a time set aside to minister to one another on a personal basis may we encourage one another in the word and may we lord get involved in one another on on a daily life basis and just provoke one another to love and good works to give encouragement lord bless the food bless the time bless the atmosphere may you be central in all things and may you find welcome in our hearts and all things that we say and do for we thank you lord for a body of believers to fellowship with we thank you for a people lord of camaraderie and like precious faith may we all together lay in your presence and grow
