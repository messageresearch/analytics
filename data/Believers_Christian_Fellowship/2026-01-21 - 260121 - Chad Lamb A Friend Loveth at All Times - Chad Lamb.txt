Children of the light, arise. Arise. This is your day. It's by grace. It's by grace. It's by grace.

Let's go to the key of G. Thank God I am free. For a long time I traveled down a long lonely road. My heart was so heavy in sin I sang. Then I heard about Jesus. What a wonderful hour. I'm so glad that I found out he could bring me out through his saving power. Thank God I am free. Free. Free from this world of sin. I've been washed in the blood of Jesus. I've been born again. Hallelujah. I'm saved. Saved. Saved by his wonderful grace. I'm so glad that I found out he could bring me out. Show me the way. Like a bird out of prison that's taking it. Like a blind man that God gave back his son. Like a poor wretched beggar that's found fortune and fame. I'm so glad that I found out he could bring me out through his holy name. Thank God I am free. Free. Free from this world of sin. I've been washed in the blood of Jesus. I've been born again. Hallelujah. I'm saved. Save by his wonderful grace. I'm so glad that I found out he could bring me out. Show me the way. Oh Lord, I want to love you more. more than I ever had before. You're so easy to adore. Lord, I want to love you more. Lord, I want to praise you more than I ever have before. You're so worthy to be praised. Lord, I want to praise you more. I want to give you all. Lord, I want to give you more than I ever have before. You're the one I'm living for. Lord, I want to give you more. I want to praise you. And Lord, I want to praise you more than I ever have before.

And I love you, Lord. And I live my voice. voice to worship you oh my soul rejoice joy my king in what you here. May it be a sweet, sweet sound in your ear. As brother Chad comes this morning or this evening, there is none like you. No one else can touch my heart like you do. I could search for all eternity, Lord, and find there is none like you. There is none like you. No one else can touch my heart like you do. I could search for all eternity, Lord, and find there is none like you. There is none like you. None like you. No one else can touch my heart like you do. I could search for all eternity, Lord, and find there is none like you. Amen. Let's bow our heads together this evening. Lord Jesus, there is truly none like you. And God, we're so thankful, God, that you've given us a voice that can sing your praises. You've given us hands we can lift to you and surrender. Given us a place to gather and an opportunity to come and praise your name. For God, we are so thankful for all that you've done for us. We love you so much. You've been so good. We just want to sing it. We just want to say it. We just want to surrender, Lord, in your presence and let you have more of us, Lord. That we would just surrender more and lay ourselves at your feet and pour ourselves out to you. That you might pour yourself into us. That you might take a greater portion than you've ever had and have more liberty in our lives and use us for your plan in this end time. get glory in these vessels of clay. For you purchased us with your own blood. May you use us, indwell us, Lord, and reflect your life through us. God, I pray you'd come now and minister to us, Lord, according to your method, Lord, through the foolishness of preaching. May you come and break the bread of life as we surrender to you. May you teach us and instruct us out of your word. May we leave here, Lord, equipped, taught, instructed in the ways of righteousness. We love you. We surrender all to you and ask you take preeminence now. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you all this evening. If you'd like to take your Bibles with me, we'll turn to Proverbs chapter 17. Amen. I just want to say how much I enjoyed this past Sunday with brother Isaiah Brooks. It was quite a refreshing service for me and it was like brother Isaiah came and fan the flames once again. Amen. And it was it was a blessing. Amen. I rejoiced in it and I've been chewing on it since then. Amen. Also, I wanted to let you know that brother Eugene Braun will be coming our way next month. I was able to secure dates with him last week. February 14th and 15th. He'll be here. Uh February 14th is Saturday. And we're going to do a couple service for all married couples here in the sanctuary at 3 p.m. So next month, February 14th, for all married couples with brother Eugene Bronn will be here in the sanctuary. And then Sunday the 15th will be our our regularly scheduled Sunday service and he'll be taking that service for us. So I'm looking forward to that. So be in prayer for that and uh uh be praying for brother Eugene as well. And then also I wanted to let you know that next Wednesday night, January 28th, I'm going to start our tape service. So every winter we like to do a tape. I'm going to do two this year because the first one I want to do is a really short one, but it's been on my heart for some time to do it. And I tried to get books from Brother John, but they had a limited number that we could get. But I I just feel to do the tape anyways. We're going to have maybe uh we can have it in our tablets, our phones. We'll have a few books. We'll have it on the overhead. But I want to do the tape. So, I want to start with the tape, a guide next Wednesday. It'll take us two Wednesdays to do that. So, be praying for that and be looking forward to that as well. I look forward to it every year. And so, I'm excited to do that together. And this one in particular has just been stirring in my heart for some time. And so, I'm excited to get to that. Amen. So, be praying about all of those things. Uh, Proverbs 17 verse 17. And we'll read just one scripture while we're yet standing. Proverbs 17:17. A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. Amen. God bless you. As you have your seats. Amen. Don't know that I've ever opened a service with that scripture. Amen. But uh if we go ahead and pull the PowerPoint up, I want to preach on the subject. A friend loveth at all times. Amen. And uh I've uh been meditating on this for quite a while. There's been a subject I've talked to several people about. I've been threatening to preach this for months. Amen. Maybe even more than months. And it's just a thought that I've been meditating on and finally I got a bit of inspiration. And it was interesting because remember the story I told you when brother Chris take was here how no inspiration it was all dried up and I got the text from him and we switched it around. He took the service. Well, I said as soon as he agreed to take the service, the inspiration started flowing. Well, it started flowing for this service. And so I started I started getting the inspiration and and putting some notes together. And then I was going to preach it last Wednesday, but last Wednesday that was canceled because of snow. But what was funny is brother Chris Tate came and when he preached there was a couple statements he made that was exactly in line with what I wanted to preach on this subject. So to me it was like praise God it's a confirmation. And then we get to this Sunday and brother Isaiah Brooks took a just a minute or two and started hitting right on the same subject. I said well praise God that's another confirmation for me. So it's a very simple subject. I just want to teach on it. Amen. And pray that God will just feed us on his word. Amen. So, a friend loveth at all times. Amen. That's what I want to focus on is a friend loveth at all times. Uh I've got quite a few scriptures to go to, but they're all on the PowerPoint, so I've put it all on there so we can make some progress. Amen. Proverbs 18:24. A man that hath friends must show himself friendly, and there is a friend that stickketh closer than a brother. So this whole service, don't wait for me to start getting to the real deep stuff because we're just teaching a subject and we're teaching on being a good friend. &gt;&gt; So if you want to know where we're going, that's it. From beginning to end, we're going to teach on what it means to be a good friend because a friend loveth at all times. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so a friend must show himself friendly. And there is a friend that stickketh closer than a brother. Amen. We know that ultimate friend is Christ Jesus. But but there's friends. We have friends that sticketh closer than brother a brother. Brother Brandham or Ecclesiastes 4:9 says, "Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor. For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow, but woe to him that is alone when he fall, for heath not another to help him up." Again, if two lie together, then they have heat. But how can one be warm alone? And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him, and a three-fold cord is not quickly broken. This whole concept of being a good friend and having a friend is run through the whole scripture. It's amazing when you start thinking about it. It's everywhere in the Bible. Amen. And and the Ecclesiastes tells us it's better, two are better than one. It's better to have a friend. It's better to have one that's with you in a time of need than to be all alone. Amen. But to have friends, you must show yourself friendly. Amen. So to have friends, you must be a friend. &gt;&gt; So to have one in your time of need, you must be one in a time of need. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's what brother Benham says. And wouldn't it be good if all God's sheep when the heat was on would stand together? When the trials are real hard and the heat is on and everything going on everywhere, if all of God's little sheep would just stand together, we'd have the coolness of shade of each other, the comfort to lean upon each other. Now, someone said, "Is that necessary, Brother Brandham?" It certainly is. There is nothing like having a real good, dependable friend that when the troubles are blazing, the heat's on, you can go to this friend and sit down and just explain it to them, talk it over in personal confidence, and then kneel down and pray together and know that this person is a good, God-saved man or woman that you can put confidence in. Oh, it's good to do that. It's good to have a friend. It's good to have somebody have confidence in. It's good to bear one another's burdens. &gt;&gt; It's a good thing. Amen. But I want to talk about how to do that. And and and we'll you'll see where we're going as we keep moving forward. Amen. Because there's a lot of instruction in the scripture. Hebrews 10, we know this scripture well. says, "Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering, for he is faithful that promised, and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works, not forsaking the ascending of ourselves together, as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the day approaching." Amen. The Bible tells us to come together, &gt;&gt; spend time together, don't forsake the assembling of ourselves together. Amen. as this manner of some is, but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the day approaching. Do we see the day approaching? &gt;&gt; Then this should be more and more. But it says, "Consider, let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works." And I love this word provoke. And I love the definition. Amen. If we look at the meaning at the bottom, it says an inciting, an incitement, an irritation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's irritate each other into love and good works. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I love it. Sometimes when you look up a definition, YOU'RE LIKE, "WHAT? HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?" AMEN. But the reality is, if a friend loveth at all times, Amen. What will our love do? And what is the product of our love? We want to see the very best for a friend. Amen. And we want to see them progress in the things of God. We want to see them moving forward. Amen. We don't want to just pander to them. We want to just pet them and stroke them. A mean. We want to be kind and loving, but we want to do that which is best for them. And we want to kind of uh uh uh move them along, push them, go them, poke them, prod them a little bit and say, "Hey, hey, I haven't seen you in a while. How are you doing spiritually? What's going on in your life?" &gt;&gt; Amen. Some people get so offended at that. Amen. They they if they haven't seen you in a couple services and somebody says, "Hey, I haven't seen you. Is everything okay?" People get so offended. Why are you checking on me? I'M FINE. LISTEN, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. That's exactly what we're there's a brotherhood for. That's why we're sheep. That's why we bind ourselves together. We're here to bear one another's burdens. We're here to be our brother's keeper. We're here to check on ONE ANOTHER. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR. LET'S NOT GET OFFENDED. AMEN. AS soon as you get offended and bristle up when somebody asks where YOU'VE BEEN, AMEN, RIGHT OFF, ALARM GO BELLS go off. There's something wrong there. Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, if somebody comes to you and starts heaping condemnation, now that's a different problem. But if somebody genuinely in love says, "Is everything okay, brother?" &gt;&gt; Amen. And we got to be careful how we go. Don't go assuming that you're you're the you're the uh church attendance police and you're going to fix them up cuz you're going to walk away with your hat and your hand and your and your shoe in your foot or your foot in your mouth. Sorry. You should have your shoe in your foot or your foot in your shoe because you'll find out somebody's been sick or they've had a death in the family. They've been taken care of a sick elderly. You got to be careful that you don't have it all figured out that you actually go in love and concern and find out what's going on. &gt;&gt; Amen. But don't go to be the one to tell them the truth. And &gt;&gt; because a friend loveth at all time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we speak, we speak out of love. When we ask, we ask out of love. When we're concerned, we're concerned out of love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're supposed to provoke one another into love and good works. We're supposed to encourage each other to keep moving forward. Amen. To to not let anybody fall behind and fall back. But that's why we're a body. That's what we're supposed to do. This word exhorting, but exhorting one another. This word exhorting means to admonish, to console, to encourage, to strengthen by consolation, to encourage, to strengthen, to instruct, to teach. So, we're supposed to uh provoke, amen, one another, and to love and good works, to keep each other moving forward. But we're also to exhort one another, to encourage, to strengthen, to instruct, to admonish, amen, to encourage by consolation. Amen. To to to do that for our brothers and our sisters. That's what a friend does. &gt;&gt; Amen. A friend is not just somebody who's syrupy, sweet, nice, and complimentary all the time. &gt;&gt; That's an associate. That's not a friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But a friend can ask you the hard questions. &gt;&gt; A real friend can. &gt;&gt; Just a casual associate can't get by with that. But a real friend can ask the hard questions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. As iron sharpeneth iron, so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. &gt;&gt; That's another good one. &gt;&gt; That's like provoke. &gt;&gt; Cuz how does iron sharpen an iron? I mean, it's it's Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Anybody sharpen a knife? &gt;&gt; Anybody use a file? &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, if you've ever done that, you know, you're you're scraping metal against metal and taking the burrs and the rough edges off and sharpening that knife. Amen. through a bit of abrasion and a bit of a rubbing. And as iron sharpeneth iron, so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friends. What's the point of having a friend is your friendship. Does it make you better? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We should be We should have friends who make us better. Friends who provoke us to go higher. Friends who encourage us. Friends who stand by us. Friends who love us. Friends who have a right to ask us hard questions. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if we don't have a friend like that, we don't have a friend. &gt;&gt; We have an associate. We have somebody that we know in a group setting, but not a friend. And we need a friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus was a good friend. &gt;&gt; He told his disciples, he called them friends, but did he ever rebuke them? &gt;&gt; Oh man, &gt;&gt; he did. &gt;&gt; But he was a friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he loved at all times. Right? &gt;&gt; In Proverbs, it says, "Open rebuke is better than secret love. Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of enemy are deceit." &gt;&gt; I love this. Faithful are the wounds of a friend. That's amazing. Has anybody ever had a friend call you out when you weren't thinking, weren't doing, weren't acting right? Mhm. &gt;&gt; Did it hurt? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope you appreciate it. &gt;&gt; I've learned to appreciate it. I've had a friends who've have called me out. Amen. I've had friends who've asked hard questions and friends who pointed out discrepancies in my life or discrepancies in my conduct. Amen. And and at the end of the day, I was thankful somebody loved me enough to tell me. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the kisses of an enemy are deceitful. &gt;&gt; I mean, you can get you can get a lot of people to be super nice to you, but that doesn't make them a friend. And that doesn't mean that they've got your best interest in mind. &gt;&gt; Many times, the people who can be super syrupy, sweet, and over-the-top nice, they only have their own interest in mind. &gt;&gt; Usually, when they're overthe-top nice, usually they're doing that for themselves, &gt;&gt; right? I'd rather have somebody who's just blunt and straightforward and just tell me the truth than that super sweet gushy gush all over the place. Every time somebody does that to me, I'm like, something's wrong here. &gt;&gt; Nobody has ever liked me this much. Then you know something's up. &gt;&gt; But faithful, the open rebuke is better than secret love. Faithful or the wounds of a friend. A friend can wound another friend in love. &gt;&gt; Remember, a friend loveth at all times. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've never had a friend wound me this way because they hated me. &gt;&gt; But only because they loved me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message does God never change his mind. He says, "What if you've seen a man that you loved out in a boat floating right down toward the falls and know that boat was going to sink with him and you say, "Well, I love him, but he's got his own ways." No, I couldn't do that. That's not in me. I'd scream, run out and grab him, shake him, jerk him in, or anything else to get him out of there. You see, if you had a friend like that and he was going to destroy his life and he was going to go off the falls and and you went and did everything you could to just jerk him out to rescue him and pull him out, even if you saved his life and pulled him out and he's mad at you and he walks home angry with you, you're still satisfied that you loved him enough. Amen. Even to take the breaking of a friendship because I love him that much to save him. &gt;&gt; That's love that's for my friend. That's not love that's for me. Right. &gt;&gt; Too many times we act in love that benefits self, not love that benefits the one we claim to love. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if we love that person, even if saying something could cause a rift, even if saying something could cause them, amen, to misjudge me or pull away from me or be hurt towards me or clam up and not talk to me anymore, it's I love them enough and concerned enough to say something and risk that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. that may hurt me rather than not say anything. &gt;&gt; That's a real friend. And if you've ever had a friend like that, treasure that friendship. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even in parenting, brother Rem says, "If Junior stands out there in the street and he's out there making mud a mud pile in the middle of the street where their cars are passing by, you say, "Junior, bless your little heart, honey. You shouldn't be sitting out there. When you get ready, come in." That's not love. &gt;&gt; You don't love your child and you take him out there and jerk him out of that street and get you a stick and teach him he shouldn't go out there again if you really love him. &gt;&gt; So remember our subject, a friend loveth at all times. Uh are we that kind of friend? Listen, the question is, I want A FRIEND, BUT WHAT kind of friend am I going to be? Because if I'm going to have friends, I must be friendly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus was the kind of friend that if you were going into destruction and you were doing something that was going to destroy you, he would have said something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a good friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. He that rebuketh a man afterward shall find more favor than he that flatterth with the tongue. &gt;&gt; Amen. He that rebuketh a man afterward shall find more favor than he that flatterth with the tongue. Amen. I'm going to talk about flattery here for a little bit as I get into it. Amen. But I think flattery is sin. &gt;&gt; I think flattery is the worst thing that we could ever do to one another. And our culture is rank with it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. One of one of the people I was talking to about this message was um brother Jason Demars and me and brother Jason Mars were having a good laugh because he grew up in Minnesota. I grew up in Ohio and we were really chuckling about how horrible Midwesterners are at being honest. &gt;&gt; We're terrible at it. We are the worst. And if anybody's ever honest with you, they're automatically labeled not nice. &gt;&gt; So when did lying to everybody be considered nice? &gt;&gt; At what point culturally did lying become nice? Because somebody could lie to you to your face, tell you the most wonderful thing that ever happened, that you must be an angel that come down from heaven, and you'll love that person. But if you have somebody who tells you, "Hey, listen. You need to move over to the side because you're standing in my way and I can't see." And you'll hate that person. &gt;&gt; Why? BECAUSE OF OUR CULT, YOU BE LIKE, "HOW DARE YOU TALK TO ME LIKE THAT?" AND THE OTHER person just gush all over you and lie to you. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love it, friends. I love it when we have to face. My wife and I had to face this because we've had a lot of company stay in our home and we've had a lot of foreign brothers from overseas in our home. And when you have a lot of company in your home and a lot of different cultures and a different ways of living, Amen. you realize how bad off we are sometimes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because sometimes the foreign brothers, especially with limited English and a different culture and they don't have the British mannerism kind of culture, they come up from somewhere completely different from Asia, Africa. Amen. They don't know any better than just tell you the truth. &gt;&gt; So you ask them, my wife asked a brother one time, she goes, she goes, "How do you like the food, brother?" Or I might have asked, she cooked, I asked, "How how do you like the supper?" Uh, it didn't agree with me. I didn't care for it. Oh my goodness. I was so ashamed. I asked the question, "My wife is trying to slip underneath the table. She's melting into a pile of shame." No Midwesterner would say that. &gt;&gt; If you if you were fed something you were allergic to, if you were breaking out hives all over your body, you would say, "It's wonderful. I love it. It's the best I ever had." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, we're guilty, friends. We're all guilty. But here we have a brother and then she served a meal one time to a different brother and he was eating and he throws up his hands. Sister, sister, sister, this is too cold. She was mortified. Mortified. She had to take his plate and go warm it up. And then she didn't know is it good to use the microwave or put it back in the oven? Will he be offended? And now she's tore up. &gt;&gt; But you know what? We ask them how they like it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We ask them if it's fine. We do it all the time. We go through our customary, how do you like it? We don't ever expect anybody tell us the truth. All we want to hear is it's wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it'd be good to have a friend once in a while would say, "Oh, sister, you made it a little bit spicy this time. I can't handle it. We should all move overseas for a little bit and come back and get perfected. Or if you want, I can arrange for you to host different people. If you want to if you want a little perfection, I I have some people in mind that I could help you. It would be a great help to you. We've had people that stayed the night and we tried to get the temperature right and where the house is upstairs, you got to move the vents between summer and winter. It's too cold, too hot. and we'll try to adjust it and I'll say, "Brother, how was it?" If there's an American staying with me, it has always been fine. It has never been anything but fine. It is always perfect. But if I have a brother from overseas, he'll say, "Well, I got a little chilly last night." Or, "It was a bit warm. I had to open the window." Which is great because now I can fix the problem because I can adjust the thermostat and move the vents. &gt;&gt; My question is, what would you say? We have a problem &gt;&gt; with being honest. Now, that's fine with casual associates. This a cultural thing. We're not going to go start blowing everything up in our society. Please don't leave here and get in a fight with everybody in the world. But when it comes to friendships, we should have a friendship that can be honest. We should get to a deeper level with one another. We could come to a place where when needful, when we love somebody and we need to share something, we have the freedom to be honest with a friend. &gt;&gt; And they should have the freedom to be honest with us. And we should be thankful that they were honest, not offended they were honest. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if somebody comes to you with honesty, not with condemnation, not with insults, not with accusations, but an honest question and a concern, even if they're wrong, even if they've seeing the situation wrong and they haven't observed it right and they don't quite understand it all, we should still thank them that they cared enough to come and find out &gt;&gt; and then explain the situation. And then the friend is relieved from their burden for us and they say, "Oh, now I understand. It makes perfect sense to me. Thank you for taking the time to explain this to me. &gt;&gt; That's real friends, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's real friends. But we seem to have a problem with flattery. And flattery will will produce evil. It's it's actually not loving. Uh I said I wrote it down. This honesty is love when being honest is for the benefit of the other person. not personal gratification. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've I've known people who like to be honest. &gt;&gt; Not for you. &gt;&gt; For them &gt;&gt; because they want to speak their mind and whatever's on their mind, they want to say it and they blah blah blah blah blah. But it's never be it's never out of love. &gt;&gt; And it's never from it was never for my benefit. It was just because they like to tell me off every chance that they had. &gt;&gt; That's not love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Love is saying something even when you don't want to say it. &gt;&gt; And it's usually you don't want to say it cuz you don't want to hurt anybody, but you love somebody enough that you're going to get over yourself. &gt;&gt; Because in order to be honest with somebody, we have to have a certain degree of self-security. &gt;&gt; We have to be secure in who we are. Amen. We have to love this person enough to get over ourselves enough to have an honest conversation with somebody. Amen. And that is real love. Honest. Honesty is love when being honest is for the benefit of the other person. Amen. So I asked the question, what is true love? What is kindness? What is it to be nice? &gt;&gt; Those are good questions. Amen. Let's keep going. And when I see that rank being broke there, Brother Ram's preaching out against the churches. And he says, "Letting let down the here on the morals of the people." And I just can't stand it. I got to fly into it. That's just all I can do. And I believe at the judgment bar, you will love me better if I tell you the truth now. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; But Ephesians 4, Amen. When he says it, he ascended on high and gave gifts unto men, he starts talking about, amen, till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature, the fullness of Christ, that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the slight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie and wait to deceive, but speaking the truth in love, may grow up unto him in all things which is the head, even Christ. Amen. If we're going to speak the truth, let's speak the truth in love. And if we can't speak it in love, let's not speak it. &gt;&gt; There are sometimes that not every thought that passes through your mind you should speak. &gt;&gt; Sometimes being silent is not being dishonest. &gt;&gt; Because if you if you're not speaking the truth in love, keep it to yourself. &gt;&gt; We're not here just to tear everything down. We're here to edify, build up, encourage, provoke unto love and good works, &gt;&gt; to encourage one another. Brother Bham tells this story. You'll you'll hear it in the message in many different places. He tells a story about the Sunday school teacher who had refused the message and had resisted brother Brandham when he witnessed to her. She was part of a church and Sunday school teacher and she was dying. She was dying of a social disease and her pastor was there and he was smoking a cigarette and all the Sunday school Kim kids came to sing her into glory. But brother Benam in several places he's got different ways he words it but I pulled this out of conference. He said she was a church member. Yes sir. Her pastor standing there smoking a cigarette when she was dying. You know what she said to him? You deceiver of men. You told me I was right and you were wrong. She said, "I'm dying and I'm lost and you're the cause of it." Why? Because he wouldn't tell her the truth. He would pacify her and say, "You're fine. Everything's fine. You're a Christian. You're a Sunday school teacher. You're okay." But she wasn't okay. If she wasn't born again, she wasn't okay. If she wasn't living the word, she wasn't okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The uh Proverbs says, "A man that flatterth his neighbor spreadth a net for his feet." Right? &gt;&gt; Read that carefully. A man that flatterth his neighbor spreadth a net for his feet. So then I ask you, what is love? To spread a net at somebody's feet. What is kind? To spread a net at somebody's feet. What does it mean to be nice? To spread a net at somebody's feet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Grandparents can do this to grandkids. Yeah. Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're the sweetest little angel. You've never done anything wrong. You're so perfect. Come on. &gt;&gt; Or parents or grandparents will cover for their sweet little perfect grandchild or sweet little perfect baby and they'll go and do the rottness of the rottenest teeth and you'll be like, "Oh, you didn't mean that. Oh, she didn't mean that. Oh, aren't you a sweet little thing?" NO, YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE ROTTEN. You did wrong. How is that not spreading a net at the feet of that child? They think everything they do is wonderful and they're a wonderful person and nobody's ever holding them accountable for their actions but always covering for it. That's not nice. That's not love. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A TRAP. &gt;&gt; THAT CHILD'S GOING TO FALL IN THE TRAP CUZ THEY'RE GOING TO THINK THAT I'M A GOOD PERSON and I'm good and everybody thinks I'm fine and they never they never realize the damage they're causing to others, the damage they're causing to themselves because nobody's ever held them accountable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't make or I mean we we say the silliest things. You get a little kid who's learning to play the violin first year out, first recital. Scratch, scratch, squeak, squeak, twinkle, twinkle, little star, and you say, "You're a maestro. You played that just like Why say that?" &gt;&gt; WHY NOT SAY, "I CAN TELL YOU'VE BEEN PRACTICING. You're getting better. And if you keep practicing, you'll be playing like the adults one day." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; Why do we think it's cute to lie to them? And that's not encouraging. That's not encouraging. That's not provoking. That's not encouraging to get better. I tell them, "You're fine. You could stop practicing now." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; There's a difference between encouragement. We should be encouraging. We should be positive. &gt;&gt; Not cutting them down. Not second stanza end. I I heard a squeak. No. Come on. &gt;&gt; But let's just be real with each other. Let's be real with our children. Let's be real with our spouses. Let's be real. Amen. Sometimes faithful are the wounds of a friend. Sometimes your best friend is your spouse. Don't raise your hand. But has anybody been wounded by the honesty of their spouse? Sit on your hands. But those are good wounds &gt;&gt; because somebody loves you enough to tell you, "Amen. When we were at so- and so's house and you said that you hurt that sister's feelings." Oh, I can't believe I did that. I'm so sorry. But what if she said, "Oh, my husband's perfect. He never does anything wrong. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's break a little Midwestern crust off of us. &gt;&gt; Let's just love one another enough and love our children enough and love our spouses enough and love our brethren enough that we encourage them in the things that are right and discourage them in the things that are wrong. Amen. Even even Jesus Christ when you come to the uh book of revelations in the first three chapters when he goes to the church ages he always tells them what they did right and he tells them what they did wrong. &gt;&gt; That's love friends. &gt;&gt; Tell encourage one another. Tell them what they did right. But if there's something that's hindering there's something that's hurting something that's going to cause a problem let's let's not be afraid to mention it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. A man that flatterth his neighbor spreadth a net for his feet. Amen. We've seen people and and there's always different personality types and it's always funny and I'm not going to say too much because it gets into prying a little bit but you have characteristics in families, characteristics in in people and they almost cannot be honest. You ever been to somebody every time you give them a compliment they have to compliment you back? &gt;&gt; So they just make something up. because they feel the pressure. You just said something nice to them. They have to say something nice to you. And so they just they just makes that I like your hairbo whether they liked it or not. THEY FELT THE PRESSURE AND they just blah. &gt;&gt; Instead of just saying thank you, I appreciate you saying that. &gt;&gt; It gets into a cultural thing. &gt;&gt; I just want to learn to be honest. I want to be honest and loving. not just honest, but loving and honest &gt;&gt; and true. And I want to be a true friend. And I want to have true friends. &gt;&gt; I want to encourage one another and stand by each other in the worst of worst times and love each other no matter what. Be honest and loving. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, brother said, "This old-fashioned sassifrass preaching may be rough as it can be, but brother, that's all I know. That's what saved me, and that's all I know." Now, I don't want to offend you, but I sure would rather offend you a little now. That gets you right with God and know I have to stand there that day and you point your finger in my face and say, "Why didn't you tell me the truth?" See, I'd rather have it fixed up now. Wouldn't you all? &gt;&gt; Remember when uh Brother Isaiah was preaching on Sunday and he says, "You tell somebody the truth and they get mad at you." He goes, "I would rather make you mad." &gt;&gt; When I was sitting in my SEAT GOING, "AMEN." RIGHT. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Cuz that's what I've been meditating on. Not that we want to make each other mad, but I would I would rather rather I rather than being complicit to watching a train wreck. Amen. I'd rather say something &gt;&gt; rather than sitting back and watch a family go off the rails and watch somebody go into utter destruction or a man GO OVER THE FALLS AND JUST keep my mouth shut because I can only say nice things and I can only compliment. I can only praise. But I can never question. I can never ask if everything's all right. I can never share a concern. &gt;&gt; God, help us not to be complicit. Help us not to be Amen. sitting there watching, doing nothing, but let's be good friends &gt;&gt; and love one another with a real sacrificial love. A love that causes us to get out of our comfort zone. A love that causes causes us to risk ourselves for the benefit of somebody else. Risk our reputation. risk somebody getting upset at us. Risk being able to have an uncomfortable conversation. Amen. Risk it for the love and benefit of another human being &gt;&gt; or just stay safely behind our own safe shelter and have eyes to see but never a mouth to speak. So God help us. Help us to be true. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said remember love is corrective always. Genuine love is corrective. So you must be able to stand the correction. Brother said, "I've all my life I've cherished friends. There's nothing I love like people, and I wanted people to love me." I put this in here because Brother Brennan was a rejected little boy. All of his life, he wanted friends, and he loved people, and he felt the rejection all the time. And he said this also, "I was misunderstood so much to when I'd be talking on the street to someone and somebody else would come up." Well, they'd walk away and leave me stand. and I love people, but no one had nothing to do with me. I was what they called the black sheep. Here's a man with the rejection complex. And here's a man who just wants people to love him, and he loves people. Amen. But this is man's been called to be a prophet of the age. And he's been a one who's got to cry out against SIN AND CALL OUT to the man going over the falls again and again and again. And what does he get in return? Rejection. Rejection. Rejection. &gt;&gt; But I didn't reject him. I'm thankful he called out against sin. I'm thankful he CALLED OUT AGAINST MY PROBLEM, my issue, my church, MY FORM OF BELIEF. I THANK GOD THAT A MAN WHO DIDN'T WANT to did. A MAN WHO DIDN'T LIKE IT did it anyways. A MAN WHO WASN'T HOSTILE. HE WASN'T CRITICAL. HE WASN'T CUTTING anybody down, but he was under a commission of GOD AND HE LOVED human beings enough to tell the truth OUT OF THE BIBLE. AND I THANK GOD THAT HE DID. &gt;&gt; WHY SHOULD HE BE THE ONLY ONE IN AN AGE THAT done it? WHY NOT WE? AMEN. FOLLOW SUITS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise God. To me, that's real love. BECAUSE THAT MAN DID NOT WANT the rejection that followed being honest. &gt;&gt; HE WOULD GO STAND. HE WOULD BE PREACHING the truth. Amen. To ministers who were getting UP OUT OF THE BACK AND WALKING OUT AND DROVES OF them were walking out. WHILE HE WAS PREACHING, I WAS NOT disobedient to the heavenly vision. AND HE HAD TO STAND there and finish his sermon. A MAN WHO WAS REJECTED AS a boy who just wanted PEOPLE TO LOVE HIM HAD TO STAND THERE AND deliver what God placed ON HIS HEART WHILE PEOPLE WERE SHAKING their heads and walking out. &gt;&gt; And I thank God he did. &gt;&gt; To me, he's a friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus says, "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be zealous, therefore, and repent. as many as I love. He didn't rebuke and chasen all the ones he didn't love, but the ones he loved. Brother V says, "Genuine love is corrective and brings you back to the word of God." Pay attention to that. Love is corrective and brings us back to the word of God. That's the whole point. Amen. There's a couple more out of Proverbs that I want to read. A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it, and a flattering mouth workketh ruin. &gt;&gt; I'm glad it's on the screen. &gt;&gt; Brother Chad ain't saying it. The Bible's telling us this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our culture is not always right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Not everything in it wrong. &gt;&gt; It's nice to be nice. Be cordial, especially with people you don't know. &gt;&gt; The last thing I want is for us to leave here and start ripping into each other in the foyer. I never liked that shirt on you. I just want to tell you. And I never thought you should have bought that car. It's too exp. Listen friends, let's not do that. &gt;&gt; Let our honesty be motivated in love for the benefit of another. &gt;&gt; Love, not just to be honest. That's that's not love. Amen. &gt;&gt; But love in the way of concern. Love because I love you more than I love how uncomfortable I feel right. More than staying secure. &gt;&gt; I love you enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They speak vanity everyone with his neighbor. With flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak. I want to ask you this question. Have you ever complimented somebody and didn't really mean it? Don't raise your hand &gt;&gt; just because you felt the pressure to say something nice. &gt;&gt; Have you ever in your life looked at a newborn baby and say that is the most beautiful little baby but in your mind thought that is the most wrinkled ugly little thing I've ever seen. Don't raise your hand. Have you ever seen somebody's little ugly mut that they think the world of? They think it's the most beautiful dog in the world. And for you, it's got one ear bigger than the other. It's a patchwork quilt of colors and you think it's the ugliest dog in the world. But you know they think it's the greatest thing ever. So instead of just keeping your mouth shut, you know what they think. So you start spilling and gushing a bunch of stuff you don't mean. &gt;&gt; Isn't that a beautiful little dog? Oh, it's so precious. Oh, you're so lucky to have it. and your mind thinking, "If I had it, I'd get rid of it so fast." &gt;&gt; Why do we do that? We do that for ourselves &gt;&gt; cuz we want to be liked and we don't want to feel uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; It's not honest. It's not true. It's not right. And it sets a snare at somebody else's feet. And then the worst is when you hear him repeat it to somebody else. Oh, brother Chad said he loves my dog and thinks he's so beautiful. And all a suen you're going, "God, please forgive me. I'm so sorry I said that." But under the pressure of the moment, we just blah blah blah blah blah. &gt;&gt; That was a funny story. &gt;&gt; But sometimes it's not funny. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak. Let's just say what we mean and mean what we say. Let's just be honest with each other. Listen, if somebody serves you a meal and it was disgusting, don't say it was disgusting. Say, "I appreciate your effort. I'm so glad you went through all the trouble to fix this for me." Amen. But don't tell them it was the best thing you ever had because the problem is they're going to serve that to the next guest and you don't love the next one who's coming over. &gt;&gt; You just loved yourself. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It's funny, but when we talk about little things, it becomes consequential. &gt;&gt; We start to make people believe we're good at things we're not good at. &gt;&gt; We start to set people up for failure. We start to encourage them in things they shouldn't be encouraged in and not to discourage them in things they should be discouraged in. And we're not really honest. And we set people up for heartbreak. We set people up for destruction. &gt;&gt; Instead of just either being quiet or finding a nice way to be honest, but don't lie. &gt;&gt; And let's be honest with each other and be credible. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is fun to preach. &gt;&gt; This is not my typical sermon, but I've been wanting to preach this for months. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I want to be a good friend &gt;&gt; and I want to have good friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; John 15, this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you. I'm going to I want to highlight something here as I have loved you. That means we should love one another in the same way he loved us. &gt;&gt; Love one another as I have loved you. In the same way. And how did he love Peter? When Peter was coming and and resisting the word of God and trying to get him to bypass Calvary, &gt;&gt; he rebuked the spirit that was in Peter, he didn't mince words. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Peter was following the wrong wrong line of thinking. He was being persuaded by an evil spirit. He wasn't in line with God's word. And Jesus never stood by and let it go on. He told the truth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Love one another as I have loved you. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life, lay down his life for his friends. Amen. That this is a true statement. We saw that Jesus actually laid down his life for his friends. And we don't have the opportunity all the time to give ourselves at Calvary and to take a bullet for one another or things like that. But listen, can we sacrifice our our own comforts, &gt;&gt; our own comfort zone, our own self-p protection? Can we lay down our life in a minor way for each other? &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "You are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you." Henceforth, I call you not servants, for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth, but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of my father, I have made known unto you." Jesus had friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. He asked us to love one another as he loved his friends. &gt;&gt; And said, "God, help me to be that kind of friend." Amen. How did he love Peter? He loved Peter enough, Amen, that he chose Peter and he stayed friends with Peter and he would rebuke Peter. But did he reject Peter? What happened when Peter got the wrong idea about Calvary, about being persecuted? Jesus never rejected him. Jesus never said, "Get away from me. You're off the word. I'm never going to talk to you again." He stayed friends with Peter. What happened when all forsook him and Peter promised, "I'll never leave you. I'm willing to go to prison. I'm willing to give my life for you." Amen. And then Peter ran away. Amen. From the Garden of Gethsemane, abandoned Jesus Christ. Abandon his friend and his time of need. And then began to swear and curse and deny that he ever knowed the man. &gt;&gt; How did Jesus treat him then? Amen. Listen, Jesus never said, "Oh, that's okay, Peter." But he come to Peter and reconciled with Peter. He said, "Peter, do you love me?" &gt;&gt; He gave Peter a chance to make it right. He reconciled because he loved Peter. He didn't reject him. Amen. He was a true friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. He reconciled him. He stayed with him even in a rebuke. He didn't He didn't end the friendship &gt;&gt; just because there was a rebuke. Brother Brandham makes this statement. He says, "Now in the reading of the gospel, I was telling Pastor Boz just a few moments ago, and I want to express again outwardly my gratitude and appreciations to Pastor Boz. You know, we are we have our ups and downs. There's sometimes that we have our ins and outs as we call it. But Brother Joseph has proven to be my friend in all kinds of weather." And I love that all weather friend. Don't you? Whether you are right or wrong. Woo! I love that all-weather friend. Whether you're right or wrong, &gt;&gt; will you be my friend even when I'm wrong? &gt;&gt; Will you be friend enough to tell me you think I'm wrong and still be my friend? &gt;&gt; Can I be your friend? Right or wrong, in or out, up or down, can I remain a friend? &gt;&gt; If you can turn with me to the book of Job, I want to read just out of Job here for just a minute. Job chapter 2. Job chapter 2 verse 11. Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came everyone from his own place. Elephas the Tim Timmonite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zafar the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him. That was nice. some bad things that happened to him and he got in a bad way and three of his friends came to mourn with him and to comfort with him to comfort him. Is that great? &gt;&gt; But we know later Job would say, "Miserable comforters are ye." Go to chapter 32 with me. You know what they say with friends like these who need enemies? You know, Job 32:3, it says, "Also against his three friends was he was he wrath was his wrath kindled because they had found no answer and yet had condemned Job." Why was God angry? Why was his wrath kindled against the three friends? Because they didn't know what was happening to Job or why. They didn't understand the trial. Job himself didn't understand the trial. But instead of just bearing through the trial with Job, they had to somehow come up with an answer. And they made it Job as a secret sinner. Somehow you're wrong, Job. And if you'll just admit you're wrong and stop being so proud. If you'll just do all that, it'll all work out. Hey, listen. And they were dead wrong. There wasn't anything wrong with Job. Amen. God had put him in a trial. &gt;&gt; And these friends, they came to comfort and to mourn with and to comfort Job. Amen. And that's fine. They should have just done that. They just stuck with him through the whole process and been a friend to him instead of start saying, "Well, I think maybe this and I think maybe that." Listen, they were just guessing. They didn't know. They had no knowledge. They were just guessing. &gt;&gt; That's why TO BE A TRUE FRIEND, LISTEN, if your friend gets in trouble and something goes wrong and something in their family goes wrong, don't go up there and start trying to help them figure out what it was. Well, maybe because this and remember that and you didn't go to communion and this. Listen, if you don't know why, then don't act like you know why. &gt;&gt; Because all you do is start heaping condemnation and guilt upon a friend. And it may have nothing to do with what the friend's done. Amen. Maybe God's just testing you to see if you're a friend &gt;&gt; OR TESTING YOUR FRIEND TO see if he'll stay TRUE TO THE WORD. DON'T START GUESSING. Don't start assuming. When I say we have to be honest WITH ONE ANOTHER, HONEST with one another is something that you know is a problem or you've seen or you know for sure or you ASK A QUESTION. YOU'RE NOT BEING HONEST IS NOT THROWING ACCUSATIONS. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; MAKING STUFF UP, PLAYING THE PART OF GOD AND SAYING, "I THINK BECAUSE YOU did this now this and this and this is happening." Listen, that's playing God. &gt;&gt; Don't do that to a friend. That discourages a friend. Don't ever do that. You just stay with them and let God sort it out. &gt;&gt; If you ever have to go to a friend and be honest with them, it should be something that you know. &gt;&gt; You saw it. You heard it. You know it. &gt;&gt; Or if you go with a question, the question's not condemnation. &gt;&gt; A question is I I didn't understand this. Can you explain this to me? &gt;&gt; That's a friend. Yeah. &gt;&gt; To stick with one another all the way through. Good or bad, &gt;&gt; up or down, right or wrong, stick with one another. &gt;&gt; Why is it so hard when our friend makes a mistake to stay with them? Jesus did, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We can, too. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Which one of us has come to sinless perfection yet? That's right. &gt;&gt; We're all going to make mistakes. &gt;&gt; Some of them will be visible and some of them will be private. Some others will know, some won't know. But why can't we stay a friend? &gt;&gt; I mean, and call a spade a spade. If there's wrong, wrong. Don't smooth it over. &gt;&gt; Don't say, "Oh, no, no, you're a perfect angel." No, what you did was pretty bad, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But I'm here to stay with you, brother. &gt;&gt; Get back up. Let's keep going. Grace is still sufficient for you. &gt;&gt; Let's make it right. Let's let's correct the error and let's keep moving forward. Let's be a real friend. &gt;&gt; Second Timothy, the Apostle Paul says, "At my first answer, no man stood with me, but all men forsook me. I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge. Notwithstanding, the Lord stood with me and strengthened me that by me the preaching might be fully known and that all the Gentiles might hear and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. Paul knows what it was like to be forsaken by friends. He said, Deeus, he wrote to Timothy, Deeus has forsaken me, having loved this present world. And brother Brennham said, why did Deeus leave? because it looked like Paul was all washed up and that his ministry was over and his power was all gone and Deeus left him. &gt;&gt; That is not a real friend. &gt;&gt; Why was Deeus friends with Paul? For Deus &gt;&gt; because when it started to cause Deus grief to be Paul's friend, &gt;&gt; he left. &gt;&gt; What about brother Brandham? When he had the meetings all over the place in the late 40s, early 50s, it was it was good to be his friend. &gt;&gt; But when everybody started pulling away from him and accusing him of being a false prophet and teaching wrong and making himself something, his friends started disappearing. &gt;&gt; Same thing happened to Paul. His friends started vanishing when he said, "They're offended at my change because he was arrested and put in bondage." Amen. They got offended and they started assuming maybe something was wrong. His ministry washed up. God's not dealing with him like he used to. And God WAS DEALING WITH HIM LIKE HE ALWAYS HAD. HE WAS RIGHT IN THE WILL OF GOD, RIGHT WHERE God wanted him. He was going to write the prison epistles. He was going to write our New Testament in those chains. But because his friends didn't understand the will of God, they assumed something was wrong. HE'S LOST HIS POWER. HE'S LOST HIS MINISTRY. HE'S ALL WASHED UP. And they left him, proving they were only friends with Paul for their benefit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not a real friend. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're ever a real friend, there's times that being a friend to a real friend is going to cost you &gt;&gt; and make you look bad and maybe make you look compromised and maybe people question you. &gt;&gt; Be that kind of friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't save yourself. Save your friend. &gt;&gt; Because why? No greater love hath any man than he laid down his life. Timothy saw and heard everything Deus saw and heard. Timothy experienced everything all the other ones. But Timothy stayed with Paul. &gt;&gt; There was a lot of brethren who stayed with brother Benham. And I'm thankful that they did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's stay with each other. &gt;&gt; Love one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews 13 says, "Let your conversation be without covetousness, and be content with such things as you have. For you have said, for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee, so that we may boldly say, the Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "He'll never leave you nor forsake you." Right. &gt;&gt; Have you always been a good friend to him? &gt;&gt; Did you ever make him look bad? &gt;&gt; Was he still your friend when you were wrong &gt;&gt; and done wrong? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Was high and low and in and out and up and down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Love one another as I have loved you. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're supposed to be Christ's representative on the earth. We're supposed to represent him and to love one another. Be a friend the way he's been a friend. And he's promised to never leave us nor forsake us. I believe he's never forsaken me. &gt;&gt; I believe he's always been there for me. Every time I've repented, he's taken me back. He's called me to repentance. He's rebuked me. He's caused others to come and be honest with me. He's called preacher to come to the pull pit. And he's exposed me. &gt;&gt; And I thanked him for it. &gt;&gt; And I loved him for it. &gt;&gt; He's never forsaken me. But oh, I've been a hard friend to be a friend to sometimes. Amen. I I I've done things that would embarrass him, things that were wrong, &gt;&gt; but he didn't forsake me. &gt;&gt; He didn't cast me away, just like he didn't Peter. &gt;&gt; And I don't want to cast anyone else away. &gt;&gt; I want to be a true friend. &gt;&gt; Why? Because a friend loveth when? &gt;&gt; At all times. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just your good times. &gt;&gt; Right. A friend loveth in your bad times. &gt;&gt; A friend loveth at all times. &gt;&gt; That's a friend. &gt;&gt; Brother Benham took this friendship into marriage in the message the invasion of the United States in 1954. He says, "And when a man starts to get married, the type of girl woman that it's more than just look at a beauty. You've got to get somebody both soul and body joined together. somebody that's really going to be your friend and pal that'll stick with you through thick and thin. There's ever a friendship that'll be tested, it's the friendship that moves the marriage. &gt;&gt; And you've got to stick with each other through thick and thin. &gt;&gt; Good times and bad times. There's been times I know that I've not been a good friend to my wife. There's been times that I've embarrassed her. I mean, that shouldn't be shocking. You guys know me well enough now. That should be like, "Yeah, we know that." But she never left me. She stayed right there. There have been times I would make an embarrassing comment. She would flush. She would turn red. But she's not bailing on the friendship just because &gt;&gt; I hit a low mark. I missed the mark. I made a mistake. She stayed with me. And there's been a few times I've had to stay with her, but it's more her with me than me with her. But but you got to have somebody to stick with you. And this gets tested in marriage. But it holds &gt;&gt; because of love. &gt;&gt; And if it holds in marriage, it can hold in every other friendship. It can hold in the body. It can hold a brother to a sister, sister to a sister, brother to a brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It can hold. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus says this, "Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I've commanded you. And lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world." That's the kind of friend he is. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of friend I want to be. A friend loveth at all times. A friend will love you more than they love their own comfort. A friend will love will do for you what is best for you. Even if it's a difficult conversation, that's a real friend. So, how many wants a friend? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then we're going to have to be a friend. &gt;&gt; How many wants a friend like the one I've described? &gt;&gt; Then you've got to be a friend like the one I've described. It's amazing how the Bible instructs us in every area of our life. If we'll just come the Bible way and not our cultural way and not our family traditional way and not our church way, but we'll just come to the Bible way. &gt;&gt; Then we'll find real victory, real victory in love divine. &gt;&gt; Because remember, brotherly love is the last stage before perfect love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God is bringing us into perfect love through brotherly love. And guess where our tests are going to be? Yeah, &gt;&gt; right at the capstone, friends. &gt;&gt; This is the capstone age. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's all stand. Musicians, if you'll come and Blake, if you'll come. So glad I could share that with you. Amen. Listen, don't flatter me. If you didn't like the message, don't say nothing. Don't say that was really good, brother Ted. Just say I appreciate your effort. I could tell you tried hard. I love you all. &gt;&gt; I want to be a good friend to you. &gt;&gt; And I want you to be my friend. We're going to need each other. Hey, listen. Don't think that the devil's not going to pull some stunts. Try some tricks. Bring division. try to bring separation because by this all men shall know you're my disciples when you have love one for the another. Where do you think the trial is going to be? Amen. If if this is where God is manifesting himself in a bride body, Amen. where you have to have every finger, toe, amen, nose, ear, eyebrow connected to each other and plugged in and and and providing for one another and edification to one another. Where do you think the test is going to be? &gt;&gt; And friendship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I for one want to pass the test &gt;&gt; and I want to love you more than I love myself &gt;&gt; because the kind of friend Jesus Christ was. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads and pray. Dear Lord Jesus, I thank you that you've never left me nor forsaken me. And you've kept your promise that you'll be with us always, even to the end of the world. And God, we we believe that. We know it's true, Lord Jesus, because you've been a true friend to us. You've stuck by us. You've been honest with us. You've corrected us when we were wrong. You encouraged us when we were right. Lord, you poured the bomb of Gilead. When we need healing, you spoke words of love and comfort. When we were discouraged, when we were thinking wrong, you gave us words that corrected our thinking. You lined us back up. You have done everything to be a good friend. And Lord, we want to be a good friend to one another. God, would you come help us break out of the mold that society has tried to put us in that? Let our culture and family traditions and even in our own genetic makeup. Would you help us Lord to go beyond the limitations but come to your word and to love one another to love each other with a fervent love an unfeigned and unpretending real genuine love to where we can bear with one another all the way to the end where we can come alongside a brother to comfort and to mourn with them not even understanding why they're suffering and not try to figure it out like Job's friends but just stick with them. Help us to be that kind of friend. And Lord, when we find that a friend is offended or done wrong like Peter did to you, let us be the kind of friend you were to Peter, Lord, where you just reconcile and take him back and trust him and love him. Be a real friend. God, I pray you'd help us, that you would correct us, that you would make us be your reflection on this earth. And if there's anything, Lord, whether it's a family tradition, a personality trait, a cultural issue, would you break it off of us and let your word live inside of us and let us manifest just your word. We love you. We ask that you would bless us, that you would help us, you help us to be an encouragement and a blessing and a source of comfort and love to one another. May we be like those sheep in the heat of the day, leaning on one another, yielding ourselves to each other for their benefit, shielding, protecting, shading, supporting each other. We love you. Help us to be the friend that loveth at all times. We ask that you'd help us with this in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. I have found a friend in Jesus. He's everything to me. He's the fairest of 10,000 to my soul. The lily of the valley. In him alone I see. All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole. In sorrow he's my comfort. In trouble he's my stay. He tells me every care on him to roll. Hallelujah. He's the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star. He's the fairest of 10,000 to my soul. He all my grief has taken and all my sorrows bone. In temptation, he's my strong and mighty tower. I have all for him forsaken and all my idols torn from my heart. And now he keeps me by his power. And though all the world forsake me and Satan tempts me sore, through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal. Hallelujah. He's the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star. He's the fairest of 10,000 to my soul. He will never never leave me nor yet forsake me here. While I live by faith and do his blessed will. A wall of fire about me. I have nothing down to fear. With his man he my hungry soul shall fill. And then sweeping up to glory to see his blessed face where rivers of delight shall ever. Oh hallelujah. He's the lily of the valley. The ring morning star. He's the fairest of 10,000 to my soul. Well, I found a friend in Jesus. He's everything to me. He's the fairest of 10,000 to my soul. Oh, the lily of the valley and him alone I see.

He's the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star. He's the fairest of 10,000 to my soul. Fill my way every day with love as I walk with a heavenly love. Let me go all the while with a song and a smile. Fill my way every day with love. Let me walk blessed Lord in the way. Thou hast gone, leading straight to the land above. Giving cheer everywhere to the sad and low. Fill my way every day with love. Oh, fill my way every day with love as I walk with a heavenly love. Let me go all the while with a song and a smile.

As I walk with a heavenly love, let me go all the while with a song and a smile. Fill my way every day with love. Oh, fill my way every day with love. As I walk with a heavenly dove, let me go all the while with a song and a smile. Fill my way every day with love. Well, I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God. I've been washed in the fountain. Cleansed by his blood. Join tears with Jesus as we travel this song. For I'm part of the family, the family of God. You may notice that we say brother and sister around here. It's because we're a family and these folks are so near. When one has a heartache, we all share the tears and rejoice in each victory in this family so dear. I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God. I've been washed in the fountain, cleansed by his blood. Join days with Jesus as we travel this song. For I'm part of the family, the family of God. From the doors of an orphanage to the house of a king, no longer an outcast, a new song I sing. From unite to riches, from the weak to the strong. I'm not worthy to be. But praise God, I belong. I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God. I've been washed in the fountain, cleansed by his love, joining tears with Jesus as I travel this for I'm part of the family, the family of God. key of F.
