[12:53] let's just bow our heads for word of
[12:54] prayer
[12:56] most gracious heavenly father how that
[12:58] sends joy bells in our hearts
[13:01] to think that a great almighty or
[13:03] powerful omnipotent god holding the
[13:06] universe in the palm of his hand and you
[13:09] care about us
[13:11] lord reading in your word last night to
[13:12] my daughters i read there in psalms
[13:15] where david stood amazed he said the
[13:17] thought your thoughts towards me and
[13:19] more than the grains of sand upon the
[13:21] seashore he said i cannot i can't handle
[13:24] this david was in shock and in awe
[13:27] and lord to think that the same god that
[13:29] thought that about david thinks that
[13:30] about us
[13:32] lord we're on your mind how that just
[13:34] makes us feel
[13:35] lord let the world fall apart let the
[13:37] world go insane the lord
[13:40] you're we are on your minds
[13:43] we are in your heart lord you've never
[13:45] taken your eyes off of us you know right
[13:47] where we are
[13:48] you know right where we're going you
[13:49] know like david said if i make my my bed
[13:52] in hell thou art there
[13:54] lord you know where we go you go with us
[13:57] lord we so appreciate that lord i
[14:00] appreciate those that have gathered
[14:01] tonight lord and lord i just pray that
[14:04] you would be blessed
[14:05] lord would your people be helped
[14:07] lord may all things and be said and done
[14:10] tonight for your honor and for your
[14:12] glory lord you know what we have need of
[14:14] lord you know just the right vitamin the
[14:17] right word lord to give us strength to
[14:19] the journeys ahead and so that we can
[14:21] fulfill this great mystery lord that you
[14:24] hid in these earthen vessels
[14:26] lord we just ask that your presence
[14:27] would just be with us now in jesus name
[14:30] amen
[14:32] amen while you're standing i'll have you
[14:35] take your bibles
[14:37] it's so good to be with you tonight see
[14:39] y'all
[14:40] see your faces
[14:43] and uh
[14:44] so i hope we just can have fellowship
[14:46] around the world tonight is that okay
[14:48] you know it's almost it's so much more
[14:50] fun if we're sitting around the kitchen
[14:51] table we're drinking a cup of coffee and
[14:53] just having fellowship with each other
[14:55] you know because i can speak and then
[14:56] you can give me some feedback and all
[14:58] that kind of stuff and so but tonight
[15:00] we're just having a fellowship there's
[15:02] no form in our fashion we're just people
[15:04] that by god's grace he chose he elected
[15:06] he called out and now he he
[15:09] redeemed us by his hand and now he holds
[15:11] us by his hand and he guides us by that
[15:14] same hand so let's just turn to him he's
[15:16] the only one
[15:18] in this life's journey that we can have
[15:20] confidence in
[15:22] so i like to
[15:25] i i'm trying to think if i have any
[15:27] announcements i don't think i do so
[15:28] we'll just go right to the word i think
[15:30] brother chad's okay i hope he's i hope
[15:32] he is
[15:33] i'm sorry it's just i'm already
[15:36] yeah so
[15:37] now brother ben right you don't make me
[15:39] forget about them announcements i just
[15:40] completely failed brother brother chad's
[15:42] okay right sister angie he's fine he'll
[15:44] be here on friday lord willing sorry
[15:48] and we're all looking forward to our
[15:49] pastor and brother elia coming back i've
[15:52] heard good things so if you don't mind
[15:54] let's just let's just continue i'd like
[15:57] you to turn your bibles to exodus 33 7.
[16:01] exodus 33 7.
[16:06] um
[16:10] and i heard you've been standing for a
[16:12] while so i'll let you sit in a minute
[16:18] a little lengthy portion here but if you
[16:20] could just
[16:22] enter into this thought with me
[16:26] exodus 33 7
[16:28] and moses took the temple and pitched it
[16:30] without the camp
[16:32] afar off from the camp
[16:35] and called it the tabernacle of the
[16:37] congregation
[16:39] and it came to pass that everyone that
[16:41] sought the lord went out unto the
[16:43] tabernacle of the congregation
[16:46] which was without the camp
[16:49] and it came to pass when moses went out
[16:52] unto the tabernacle that all the people
[16:55] rose up
[16:56] and stood
[16:57] every man at his tent door and looked
[17:00] after moses
[17:02] until he was gone into the tabernacle
[17:05] and it came to pass as moses entered
[17:07] into the tabernacle that the cloudy
[17:10] pillar descended
[17:11] and stood at the door of the tabernacle
[17:14] and the lord talked with moses
[17:17] and all the people saw the cloudy pillar
[17:20] stand at the tabernacle door
[17:22] and all the people rose up and worshiped
[17:26] every man in his tent door
[17:29] and the lord spake unto moses face to
[17:32] face
[17:33] as a man speaketh unto his friend
[17:37] and he turned again
[17:39] into the camp
[17:40] but his servant joshua the son of nun a
[17:43] young man departed not out of the
[17:45] tabernacle
[17:46] and moses said unto the lord
[17:49] see
[17:50] thou sayest unto me bring up this people
[17:53] and thou hast not let me know
[17:55] whom thou wilt send with me
[17:59] yet thou has said i know thee by name
[18:03] and thou hast also found
[18:06] and also found grace in my sight
[18:09] now therefore i pray thee
[18:12] if i have found grace in your sight
[18:14] show me now thy way that i may know thee
[18:18] that i might find grace in thy sight and
[18:22] consider his name and consider this
[18:25] nation is thy people and he said
[18:29] my presence will go with thee and i will
[18:33] give you rest
[18:37] you may be seated
[18:42] a bit of a lengthy reading
[18:44] i kind of stumbled across it and it
[18:46] really struck me
[18:49] how
[18:51] how god
[18:53] moses didn't know who was going to go
[18:54] with him and god had to remind him i
[18:57] want to go with you moses
[18:59] i'd like to be the one
[19:01] the bible says
[19:02] i think there's a scripture it says
[19:04] you know where
[19:05] where is the place of my dwelling but a
[19:07] body has thou prepared for me right god
[19:10] was looking for a place of rest
[19:12] and so are we
[19:14] and i there's a lot in this
[19:17] and i
[19:18] kept praying about it and i wanted to go
[19:20] some ways with this and i just seemingly
[19:23] can't could not i kept getting a blocked
[19:25] door but i kept getting one strong thing
[19:28] and so i'm i don't believe i'm prone to
[19:30] fanaticism by any means but i do believe
[19:33] sons of god are led by the spirit of god
[19:36] i think if we remove inspiration and
[19:38] holy ghost leadership
[19:40] from the church of the living god we
[19:42] just have a lot of formally educated
[19:44] individuals
[19:45] and we uh separate ourselves from the
[19:48] supernatural then there's something
[19:49] wrong with us each and every one of us
[19:52] but i have a
[19:53] direction
[19:55] and i'm nervous because that's all he
[19:57] gave me
[19:59] and i stared at this computer for hours
[20:02] and i just know i have a direction and i
[20:04] feel as confident as i've ever felt
[20:06] confident in my life that this is a
[20:07] direction he gave me a scripture
[20:10] now beyond that
[20:12] i have no idea
[20:14] is that okay
[20:17] so
[20:18] i'd like you to turn to matthews 11
[20:22] verse 28.
[20:28] and before we read it
[20:30] i was praying
[20:32] and i don't think a minister i don't
[20:36] think anybody
[20:37] that loves the lord and loves god's
[20:39] people
[20:40] as they mature in the lord do they ever
[20:42] really
[20:43] do they come to a point where they
[20:44] really care of impressing anybody
[20:48] i don't think impressing anybody is
[20:50] really an attribute of a
[20:52] holy ghost-filled man
[20:54] or woman
[20:57] if the greatest among us made of himself
[20:59] of no reputation
[21:02] his ministry continues in the bride of
[21:04] jesus christ
[21:05] i believe a
[21:07] non-reputation
[21:09] type wife is what he will find
[21:12] and so when i come to speak
[21:15] and you all know me enough by now and
[21:17] you know what i love following brother
[21:19] noel
[21:20] because we all know brother noel is
[21:22] brother noel
[21:23] and we love that about him
[21:25] i love that about him i told him i said
[21:27] brother no you carried just the right
[21:29] vitamin for me brother i can be just
[21:31] what i am by the grace of god i can't be
[21:35] nothing that i hate
[21:37] we don't have to imitate we don't have
[21:39] to be like anybody else i think it was
[21:42] choice stones and each one is unique and
[21:45] they all have their place and nobody
[21:47] fills that gap but that stone
[21:49] no matter how strangely cut they are
[21:53] and i love brother noel he can let you
[21:56] relax in your skin
[21:58] and so coming here tonight i just felt
[22:01] probably way more relaxed than i should
[22:06] because i just was so encouraged by his
[22:09] ministry
[22:11] and i and i told him i said i just so
[22:13] love a five-fold ministry i appreciate a
[22:15] five-fold ministry in this day and this
[22:17] hour when so many people don't want a
[22:19] five-fold ministry here i am standing
[22:21] over here and i love it
[22:23] i love how god can take a simple man
[22:27] who makes mistakes
[22:29] and can be honest about it
[22:31] who's fallible
[22:32] but yet god can still use that man to
[22:36] speak words of eternal life
[22:38] and he does it over and over it's a true
[22:40] paradox
[22:41] that god hid himself right in the
[22:43] paradox
[22:45] that this man can make mistakes and yet
[22:47] it's every bit god when he speaks
[22:49] and he can still make mistakes it
[22:50] doesn't mean everything he says is right
[22:52] sometimes a man may say something wrong
[22:55] but you watch the attributes of a man he
[22:57] can come back and be a real holy
[22:58] ghost-filled man and make it right
[23:01] if you question me on that you haven't
[23:02] listened to the prophet of god
[23:05] brother branham said god corrected me i
[23:07] shouldn't have been calling them rickies
[23:08] and raketas
[23:10] he said god stop me i was calling out a
[23:12] man's name he said i never should have
[23:14] done it he just checked me i did wrong
[23:18] so the holy ghost filled men make
[23:20] mistakes oh yeah sure they do but
[23:23] because they're holy ghost-filled men
[23:24] they go make it right
[23:26] they make things right
[23:27] and so it's just so interesting and i so
[23:29] love to see that wave sheet that's when
[23:31] waved before me it lets me relax
[23:35] and it helps me be just what god made me
[23:38] and so
[23:39] when i talked to brother no i got a
[23:41] chance to go over to brother jeremy's
[23:43] and talk to him for a little bit
[23:44] and he just you light up in his presence
[23:48] because
[23:49] i told him i said brother i love it a
[23:52] mature ministry and a mature people can
[23:54] say you know what brother noel you
[23:55] brought vitamin a today and that's what
[23:57] i needed brother chad will bring vitamin
[24:00] c brother ben vitamin b
[24:03] brother kyle vitamin k you know
[24:08] and there's enough maturity in each of
[24:09] us and in you to realize
[24:11] there's nothing wrong he didn't have to
[24:13] carry vitamin a
[24:15] he didn't have to carry vitamin b he
[24:16] could just carry the vitamin he needed
[24:18] to carry because the sheep needed that
[24:20] vitamin that's just what they needed it
[24:22] was the right thing it was the right
[24:23] word said in the right way and only he
[24:26] could say it just that way
[24:28] and so as time goes on i think the ideas
[24:30] of one great big man get very little
[24:34] and realizing that the ministry of god
[24:36] spread forth through a five-fold
[24:38] ministry of diverse characters
[24:41] becomes something of a very precious
[24:43] thing in our sight
[24:44] and even sometimes the most calmly
[24:46] pieces and the most of rejected ones
[24:49] seem to sometimes do so much very so
[24:52] much for you
[24:53] as time goes on
[24:55] and so
[24:58] i just got way off subject
[25:00] so i oh like i told you i had this
[25:02] direction
[25:04] and so i'm like lord you've given me
[25:05] this direction you've given me this
[25:06] scripture and if i told you how much he
[25:08] vindicated for this to me you really
[25:10] truly would think i was a fanatic but
[25:13] even it got to the point my wife said oh
[25:15] my goodness look it's here too like she
[25:16] was noticing i had shared with her this
[25:18] scripture
[25:20] and it was everywhere like everywhere
[25:23] it's at the point like
[25:26] like okay i'll give you a little sign of
[25:27] it you can just really think i'm a
[25:29] fanatic
[25:30] because i don't mind
[25:32] um
[25:34] brother man you ever pray and say lord
[25:36] if you just give me a sign what
[25:37] direction to go i'll go i'll go you ever
[25:40] prayed like that lord if i just knew
[25:42] just show me write it in the skies
[25:47] are you ready
[25:49] i was praying for this service i was
[25:51] praying for you
[25:52] and i tried to explain it to my
[25:54] daughters it's it's something strange
[25:55] you know we all have our own ways i
[25:57] guess are preparing
[25:58] i get to thinking about you
[26:01] it's weird because brother branham said
[26:02] if you don't care for the people you can
[26:03] never help them
[26:05] and so you get to like you get a feeling
[26:07] for you and i'm probably letting letting
[26:09] you in on something i don't know what i
[26:11] should tell you
[26:12] but just for me no one's ever told me
[26:14] this but it's just something i realized
[26:16] and i notice it with the youth too i get
[26:18] to getting a feeling for the youth it's
[26:20] like i have to um get out of my own way
[26:22] for a moment and then i get to thinking
[26:24] about y'all different faces come in my
[26:27] mind
[26:28] and that's how i begin when i get to try
[26:30] to relax myself and get out of the way
[26:32] and you and i start thinking about the
[26:34] congregation and i start thinking about
[26:36] the young people and the old people and
[26:38] the married people and the single people
[26:40] and i get to thinking about you and it
[26:41] helps me relax
[26:43] and that sometimes it just gets you to
[26:45] your point you get to you get to feeling
[26:46] like
[26:47] now i can i can intercede for them i can
[26:49] go to the lord for them because i can
[26:51] feel what they're feeling that may make
[26:53] no sense to anybody i'm sorry i probably
[26:56] shouldn't even have told you that but it
[26:58] starts with me having to have a feeling
[26:59] for y'all before i feel like i can help
[27:01] you and then it helps me relax
[27:03] and then as i relax i start to say lord
[27:06] what what what would you want me to say
[27:08] i don't know
[27:09] you know it's not like a minister has
[27:10] like got all these sermons ready to go
[27:13] he's like hey i'm firing this one off
[27:14] you know it's like
[27:15] you could give me two years to prepare
[27:17] and i promise you i will have no idea
[27:19] what to say
[27:20] even probably when i'm standing there
[27:22] like now it it doesn't matter for me you
[27:24] know i don't have the gifts that other
[27:26] brothers could have like give me a
[27:27] preach on this subject man they go like
[27:30] i can't even remember what i'm going to
[27:31] say even after i study a subject usually
[27:34] i told my wife when inspiration is there
[27:36] i can go for hours
[27:37] and after it's gone i couldn't tell you
[27:40] my middle name sometimes
[27:42] strange how that works that's just a
[27:44] reality
[27:47] am i helping you be more comfortable in
[27:48] your skin for a moment
[27:51] and so uh
[27:53] as i began to think that through
[27:55] that scripture come unto me all ye that
[27:58] labor and are heavy laden and i will
[28:00] give you rest
[28:02] take my yoke upon you learn of me i'm
[28:05] meek and lowly in heart
[28:07] and that ye shall find rest for your
[28:09] souls
[28:10] so that scripture kept coming to my mind
[28:12] as i'm
[28:13] starting to prepare on saturday morning
[28:16] and you know i'm like lord well i don't
[28:18] know wish i knew what direction i'm
[28:19] thinking of that scripture and i look up
[28:21] and on a billboard
[28:23] is written come unto me all you that are
[28:26] weary heavy laden i'll give you
[28:28] rest and i'm like
[28:32] wow you know that's obvious that's too
[28:34] obvious no way god would work that way
[28:36] right
[28:38] that's too easy because then if i look
[28:40] for this all the time i'll be looking
[28:41] for every billboard in lineman saying
[28:43] what's the scripture verse i'm gonna
[28:44] preach on next week you know
[28:46] but you know it doesn't work that way
[28:47] you know it really doesn't but before
[28:49] god he knows he'll i'll answer on the
[28:51] day of judgment he knows that that
[28:52] scripture was on my mind i look up
[28:53] there's the scripture and i'm like wow
[28:56] that's odd
[28:57] then i come back here and i'm talking to
[28:59] brother noel and brother noel
[29:01] right before service just to check on
[29:03] him and he's sitting there and he goes
[29:04] you know
[29:05] he said lord change my subject
[29:07] he said i was driving saturday morning
[29:09] same time i was driving and he said
[29:11] inspiration came over and i told says
[29:13] surely grab a pen i'm going to start
[29:14] telling you what to write because he had
[29:16] to drive all day i think and he didn't
[29:17] have time to prepare he said i had a
[29:19] whole sermon prepared and i can't preach
[29:20] it inspiration take me a different
[29:22] direction
[29:24] and he said i want i want to speak on
[29:26] the believer's position in christ and
[29:28] how it brings a rest
[29:31] and and he said i learned some things in
[29:32] habit cook about faith and i want to
[29:35] talk about it i said well praise god
[29:37] brother i said kind of odd it's kind of
[29:39] i think the direction i'm supposed to be
[29:40] going for wednesday night
[29:42] and then we go home we're reading a
[29:43] story to my my daughters
[29:45] and we start reading this random story
[29:47] that we just picked up to read calm the
[29:48] girls down put them to bed
[29:50] and i'm barely listening because it's
[29:52] not really good but anyhow you know
[29:54] the kids like the story
[29:57] and carrie stopped she's like you ain't
[29:58] going to believe this
[30:00] it says in the story come unto me all ye
[30:03] that are weary and heavy laden i'll give
[30:05] you rest right kerry
[30:07] i mean to the point where like
[30:09] it's too obvious
[30:12] way too obvious right
[30:16] and so
[30:18] that's what i feel
[30:20] and so you know when times gone past
[30:24] men would come by inspiration and preach
[30:27] the word
[30:28] and i began to stop and think you know
[30:30] jesus dispatched them two by two
[30:32] he said take no thought for what you're
[30:34] going to say and take no purse
[30:36] don't prepare for this you just rely
[30:38] upon me
[30:40] and then i began to realize you know god
[30:42] has always wanted a people that just
[30:44] relied upon him
[30:46] there has never been a time
[30:49] that you could look through the
[30:50] scriptures
[30:51] and find those heroes of faith that did
[30:53] not have to live their life in a
[30:55] position where their place of rest was
[30:58] in his presence
[30:59] you will never find it
[31:01] i can't find it
[31:04] and then once i began to think about it
[31:05] i realized wow
[31:07] okay let's go back to genesis
[31:09] here's cain's people
[31:11] and then here's seth's humble little
[31:13] group
[31:15] god's people seth's people chosen
[31:18] occupation farmers and herdsmen
[31:23] this occupational choice that was before
[31:26] them made them be reliant upon god for
[31:29] everything that they had need of in this
[31:32] life's journey
[31:33] everything
[31:34] never has there been a position where
[31:37] god will so gift you or so it in um
[31:41] i
[31:41] give you revelation or ever get you to a
[31:44] point where you don't need him
[31:47] i mean that's counteractive to his
[31:49] nature and his desire
[31:51] he never wanted that kind of a people
[31:53] like what kind of a husband wants a wife
[31:56] that says i truly have no need of you
[31:59] like
[32:00] stay here i like the house keep working
[32:04] but i really don't need you
[32:06] that's not the wife that god ever
[32:08] desired it's not the wife that he wants
[32:10] he wants a wife that
[32:12] loves him
[32:13] depends upon him trusts him
[32:16] says lord you said that i believe you'll
[32:18] do it
[32:20] so look at abraham god gives abraham a
[32:22] promise
[32:23] and god
[32:25] he got older but he didn't stagger at
[32:27] the promise
[32:29] because god had a hero of faith here
[32:31] this man's faith could not be shaken by
[32:33] the circumstances he found himself in
[32:37] and so i began to think this through and
[32:38] began to realize
[32:41] we're living in an hour where everything
[32:43] is falling apart
[32:46] right
[32:47] this doesn't take any spiritual
[32:50] discernment to realize that not one
[32:52] ounce
[32:54] you talk to anybody on the street
[32:56] and they are preparing for something
[32:58] really bad
[33:00] either an economic collapse
[33:03] or a famine
[33:05] or a
[33:06] politically driven
[33:08] craziness of forcing some type of
[33:11] something somewhere
[33:14] brother branham said nations are shaking
[33:17] looking for alliances you can't look at
[33:20] the news where you don't hear about some
[33:22] country that's doing some type of
[33:23] political jockeying at this moment
[33:26] because they're all scared out of their
[33:28] minds
[33:30] i mean shake yourself i should say pinch
[33:32] yourself we have arrived
[33:35] everything is shaking everything is
[33:37] falling apart
[33:38] men's hearts are failing for fear people
[33:41] are having heart attacks left and right
[33:44] they're scared to death they're building
[33:46] bunkers they're preparing for all kinds
[33:48] of things
[33:50] okay now here's god's people
[33:54] what do they do to prepare
[33:58] i mean honestly in all sincerity like i
[34:00] told you i'm just gonna be real honest
[34:01] with you i got a direction i have a
[34:03] leading i know where i'm supposed to go
[34:04] so i just talk to you what do the
[34:06] believers
[34:09] that believe that jesus christ is the
[34:11] same yesterday today and forever
[34:14] do
[34:14] in this situation
[34:18] what do they do i tell you what they
[34:21] don't do
[34:22] they don't get afraid
[34:25] they don't make economic moves to
[34:27] protect themselves
[34:29] they don't concern themselves with what
[34:31] politics are going to do
[34:34] they don't talk about it all the time as
[34:36] if that's the thing that's the most
[34:38] important to them in their life
[34:40] there's certain things a believer
[34:41] doesn't do when these things are coming
[34:43] about
[34:44] and i'll tell you
[34:48] they are preppers
[34:50] we do prep don't we
[34:52] we stay in prayer
[34:54] we stay in the word
[34:55] and we walk and conduct ourselves with
[34:57] joy in our hearts knowing oh my our
[34:59] redemption's just getting a little
[35:01] closer
[35:02] my the greatest time that we could ever
[35:04] be alive is approaching us it's coming
[35:07] fast and oh this is wonderful
[35:10] you know what i'm saying
[35:12] but i find that this
[35:14] rapture
[35:16] is the position
[35:18] of the believer
[35:20] and
[35:20] i won't go super far on this because
[35:22] there's a lot i'm chewing on with this
[35:24] but i'm finding a very clear similarity
[35:26] brother benham said that the rapture is
[35:28] a
[35:29] he said
[35:30] this revelation is faith
[35:32] and faith works by love
[35:35] so it's a position that you live in you
[35:37] know enoch just lived in a certain
[35:39] position in the presence of god
[35:42] but so few consider that like i promise
[35:46] you it doesn't really matter that you're
[35:47] a part of this church
[35:49] it doesn't matter that you are part of
[35:51] the right group
[35:52] it doesn't matter that you think the
[35:53] right thoughts that you understand the
[35:55] right doctrine i'm telling you it
[35:56] doesn't
[35:57] but if the presence of god isn't in you
[35:59] and filling your very vessel and guiding
[36:01] you and leading you every day everything
[36:02] you know means nothing
[36:04] it truly means nothing
[36:07] now
[36:08] that word will help you if he's at the
[36:10] center post of your life every word
[36:13] means something and it has its
[36:15] importance and it has its significance
[36:18] but if you haven't been filled with his
[36:20] life which dictates your actions and
[36:23] your decisions in your life then what
[36:25] did it all mean anyhow
[36:27] it meant nothing
[36:29] it was pointless
[36:31] and it wasn't a place of rest you
[36:33] couldn't have a true security in that
[36:35] and you know you can't and you know you
[36:37] don't
[36:38] and so
[36:41] can i read just some scriptures and
[36:42] we'll see what happens next
[36:45] and i i wanted to say i so appreciate a
[36:47] sister earl early this morning sent me a
[36:49] text and said i'm praying for you i felt
[36:51] inspired to let you know god woke me up
[36:53] 4am i've been praying for you and i said
[36:56] i so appreciate holy ghost leadership i
[36:58] so appreciate that someone can just
[37:00] submit themselves to do what they feel
[37:02] to do with not knowing all the reasons
[37:04] why they do it but they just do it
[37:06] and i i think that's kind of a people
[37:08] god wanted didn't he you kind of see a
[37:10] pattern why did he send him out two by
[37:11] two no personal script why did he cause
[37:13] them to go out as sheepherders and and
[37:16] and herdsmen and not think about it
[37:19] right don't worry about it you know it's
[37:21] because they wanted the people to live
[37:23] by faith he wanted a people and a wife
[37:25] that trusted him
[37:26] we didn't want a people that was so
[37:28] concerned about trying to figure
[37:29] everything out so they can manage in a
[37:31] world that's falling apart
[37:34] it's an exercise in futility complete
[37:38] waste and utter waste of time and energy
[37:41] and all it does is express your unbelief
[37:45] and i'm sorry to say that but it's true
[37:47] i ask these questions of myself but we
[37:50] have an american system i mean honestly
[37:52] guys let's think for a moment what about
[37:55] our believers in sudan
[37:57] malawi
[37:59] africa southern africa
[38:02] what do they do to prepare
[38:04] they trust god
[38:07] then i talk to american believers
[38:09] and we've got to talk an economical
[38:11] situation how are we going to make a
[38:12] move
[38:14] how are we going to prepare
[38:16] we should all move to florida they have
[38:17] a good governor
[38:21] right
[38:22] people talk like this
[38:25] that's not believers that's i mean
[38:27] that's not how believers talk i ain't
[38:29] saying you could have a temporary moment
[38:30] of insanity and lose your mind and start
[38:32] acting like the rest of the world
[38:34] but let me spiritually wake you up
[38:36] you've been called and elected of god
[38:38] for this hour
[38:40] this is the greatest of ours we could
[38:42] have ever been on this earth he must
[38:45] have had some choice soldiers that were
[38:47] prepared and ready for this type of an
[38:50] onslaught
[38:51] in this amount and this this time of
[38:54] great fear
[38:55] and and and
[38:58] uh oh boy unbelief
[39:01] he had a people that were fearless
[39:04] shadrach meshach and abednego
[39:06] god liked to put his people right up
[39:08] against the back of a fire
[39:10] he loves to do that he likes it to get
[39:13] so dark it looks like there's no way
[39:14] that this this can work out just to come
[39:17] on the scene
[39:18] just to come on the scene in the darkest
[39:20] of hours
[39:21] so what is it to us why do we concern
[39:23] ourselves with these things
[39:25] i had a man he's not a believer but he
[39:26] called me and he called me this morning
[39:28] i'm like man good timing it caught me
[39:31] like hey should i be buying gold
[39:34] i'm like
[39:36] no
[39:37] who cares i said it's gonna burn
[39:40] he said well maybe yeah yeah yeah i know
[39:42] he says he says yeah yeah yeah he goes
[39:45] maybe i should buy farmland i mean we're
[39:46] going to need to eat i said you're not
[39:48] getting it you're just not getting it my
[39:50] friend
[39:51] i wasn't a believer so you know he's a
[39:53] friend though good friend of mine i said
[39:55] no i'd hi i'd get hidden under the rock
[39:58] that's what i told him
[39:59] i said i just find that hiding place
[40:01] because that's the only thing that i
[40:03] know ain't gonna be shaken
[40:06] and so you know these things and that's
[40:08] why i said i says all i know of is that
[40:12] i'm supposed to say come unto me
[40:15] all ye that are weary heavy laden and
[40:18] he'll give you the rest that you need
[40:21] if you're discouraged if you're
[40:23] concerned if you're laying up at night
[40:24] trying to figure out how you should make
[40:26] a move next
[40:27] let me give you words of comfort your
[40:30] father
[40:31] in heaven and i don't mean to say that
[40:33] to be fanatical but it is the word
[40:36] is saying come unto me and take your
[40:38] rest
[40:39] stop worrying stop concerning stop
[40:42] trying to make moves to prepare
[40:45] he already made all the moves
[40:47] you have nothing you have to do but
[40:49] trust
[40:50] him and if you love him you will trust
[40:54] him
[40:56] and
[40:56] your actions
[40:58] will determine how much you actually do
[41:02] you know what i mean
[41:05] so
[41:07] ii corinthians says we are troubled on
[41:09] every side yet not distressed
[41:12] perplexed but not in despair
[41:15] persecuted but not forsaken
[41:18] cast down but not destroyed
[41:21] always bearing about in the body the
[41:23] dying of the lord jesus
[41:25] that the life also of jesus
[41:28] might be made manifest in our body
[41:31] for we which live are always delivered
[41:34] unto death for jesus sake
[41:36] that the life also of jesus might be
[41:38] made manifest in our mortal flesh
[41:41] and so you get to thinking about this
[41:43] you realize there is a life there is a
[41:46] decision
[41:47] and it's not always the easier way that
[41:48] you make it's not always the the more
[41:51] comfortable path that we choose in life
[41:54] but you make certain i had this and i
[41:56] told my wife i said you know honey i
[41:58] says i said to another brother says you
[42:00] ever think about it i said what cross
[42:02] are you picking up
[42:04] like
[42:06] we're americans we complain about the
[42:08] things we shouldn't complain about
[42:11] i mean it's a reproach to us it's really
[42:14] something to overcome
[42:16] because
[42:18] you
[42:19] most don't bear much of a cross
[42:22] let's just be honest
[42:23] we bear very little cross
[42:26] and how can you separate suffering from
[42:28] the christian life
[42:29] and how will you know him
[42:31] so then comes the question
[42:34] would you be willing to make a harder
[42:36] choice
[42:37] for his sake
[42:39] these are questions i ask me
[42:41] would you be willing to take up a cross
[42:44] of your own choosing
[42:46] would you be willing to choose a harder
[42:47] way
[42:49] for the glory of god and for the help to
[42:51] his people
[42:53] you know that's why as
[42:56] i really like i don't know why brother
[42:58] jarriah came and i just thought him and
[43:00] i says i appreciate the sacrifice that
[43:02] brother made to come here early open up
[43:04] everything for you all you probably
[43:06] didn't even know it came here early he
[43:08] has a family he's got kids he made a
[43:10] sacrifice for you all because he loved
[43:12] you come here early get things ready
[43:15] brother franco sister amy what a
[43:17] sacrifice they make
[43:19] trustees i know how hard you work
[43:21] you know so brother john would never
[43:24] want your position it's hot and cold at
[43:26] the same time no matter what the
[43:27] temperature is at all times
[43:30] by the way it's cold in here
[43:33] so
[43:35] but you know what i mean
[43:38] god appreciates these little sacrifices
[43:40] that they all make and we all make for
[43:42] each other
[43:45] but it's such a little thing
[43:48] god appreciates it brother branham said
[43:50] it no matter what you do god appreciates
[43:52] it
[43:53] but i just wonder could we could we make
[43:55] some other harder choices
[43:57] some career choices
[43:59] some family choices
[44:01] some personal choices
[44:03] like you know you're gonna die
[44:06] if god if your body isn't molecules
[44:08] completely changed
[44:10] one day you'll die
[44:11] and you'll have to answer for the life
[44:13] that you've been given
[44:15] and every gift and every decision you
[44:17] made is going to come up before you one
[44:19] of these days
[44:20] and it's not a light thing
[44:23] like don't get me wrong i love to be
[44:25] encouraged and i love to hear how
[44:27] wonderful we are as a people because we
[44:29] are
[44:30] we're his great choosing we're his elect
[44:32] and he's done so very much for us
[44:35] but then sometimes it just seems like
[44:37] what what have i done for him
[44:39] you know
[44:40] we get so consumed with feeling good
[44:44] that we don't consider
[44:46] he wants to take rest too
[44:48] like you see what i i read where is the
[44:51] place of my dwelling where is the place
[44:53] of my rest you know god's looking to
[44:54] take rest
[44:56] where is he going to find a people that
[44:58] he can have rest in have complete and
[45:01] total utter control over every decision
[45:05] that they make
[45:07] where can he find that kind of arrest he
[45:10] doesn't care about this building
[45:12] like
[45:13] i don't care about this building i care
[45:15] about you all
[45:16] but god doesn't care about the metal and
[45:18] the drywall and the carpets and the
[45:20] chairs
[45:21] this is not the place of his dwelling
[45:23] brother brian
[45:25] sorry another tall man
[45:27] brother joe
[45:29] brother
[45:30] for the job that's his interest
[45:33] man if i could just get that tabernacle
[45:37] that's what i want
[45:39] that's the place of my dwelling right
[45:42] but the donovan
[45:43] man i've been working on him for a long
[45:46] time
[45:47] that's what i want
[45:49] i don't want a name i don't want a
[45:51] building i don't want anything like that
[45:52] i was looking for one individual
[45:55] that could be a total sold out
[45:56] surrendered individual
[45:58] oh if i could just get that man right
[46:00] there that's all i was looking for
[46:03] you know that sister
[46:05] boy if i could just get her to realize
[46:07] how precious she is to me don't forget
[46:09] the thoughts of god to you are more than
[46:11] the sand that is upon the sea
[46:13] so i think he's had some thoughts about
[46:15] you
[46:16] i think he's been longing for a very
[46:17] long time and going to great lengths
[46:20] efforts
[46:22] to get you into a position that he could
[46:24] have full preeminences
[46:27] but remember being a perfect gentleman
[46:29] he'll never take him
[46:32] i had this thought
[46:33] where he says
[46:35] speak the truth in love
[46:37] and it struck me the other day i shared
[46:38] it with a brother
[46:39] i said you know god that that mystery
[46:42] that god wanted to have the preeminences
[46:43] in the bride was so precious to him he
[46:45] held on to it for thousands of years and
[46:47] didn't let it out
[46:49] you ever think why
[46:51] brother bam said the devil could do
[46:53] great damage with it if he did
[46:55] so it was so precious to him to hide
[46:57] this mystery that christ in you was his
[46:59] ultimate desire
[47:01] that he hid it
[47:04] and knowing that god wanted the
[47:05] preeminences in his bride realizing that
[47:07] he could never force this decision upon
[47:09] her because he built you with free moral
[47:11] agency you have to make a choice
[47:15] what would happen and i shared i think
[47:17] it was brother wesley a couple brothers
[47:20] if i told you i'm looking for a wife
[47:23] and she better be this tall
[47:24] she better be able to cook this pie she
[47:27] better be able to do this amount of
[47:29] laundry within a four-hour period
[47:32] she better be able to cook she'll be
[47:33] able to clean she better do this she
[47:34] better hug me three times a day send me
[47:36] a text tell me if she loves me tells me
[47:37] all these things right
[47:40] okay now
[47:42] say my wife finds that out and she does
[47:45] all of it
[47:46] because
[47:48] i had a little thread at the bottom
[47:50] because if she don't i will put her away
[47:54] now she could do all those things
[47:56] but is she doing them because she wants
[47:58] to
[47:59] no
[48:00] it's out of fear
[48:02] she's afraid if she doesn't she's out
[48:05] you think god wants a bride that serves
[48:07] him out of fear
[48:09] not at all
[48:11] it doesn't even fit his nature
[48:13] it's contradictory to his nature
[48:16] and so if you don't speak the truth in
[48:17] love but you speak the truth anyhow is
[48:20] it justified
[48:23] no
[48:24] not justified
[48:26] the ends cannot justify the means when
[48:28] it comes to the gospel of jesus christ
[48:31] and so i began to chew on these things i
[48:32] said well now this is an interesting
[48:34] thought what if we do all the right
[48:35] things for all the wrong reasons
[48:39] then if we do all the right things for
[48:40] all the wrong reasons then god's purpose
[48:42] is still not fulfilled in his bride
[48:46] so you could have a
[48:48] dynamic ministry
[48:50] phenomenal ministry
[48:52] that people feel compelled and pressured
[48:55] into conforming to a certain type of
[48:57] life
[49:00] and it's not what god wanted
[49:02] again doing all the right things
[49:04] absolutely all of the wrong reasons
[49:06] and you have spoiled the entire purpose
[49:09] that god had purposed in his heart for
[49:11] his people
[49:12] god wanted preeminence
[49:14] god wanted you to be willing to lay down
[49:16] your life so he could have the
[49:17] preeminences to make every decision for
[49:20] you
[49:21] and that's a shocking thought
[49:24] he's that concerned yep
[49:27] and it's so rare to find
[49:30] so hard to find a people that could be
[49:32] that surrendered to god
[49:34] that the only thing they concern
[49:36] themselves with is doing his will
[49:39] you know brother branham says in
[49:40] conferences he says god called himself
[49:42] to a conference
[49:44] strange way of stating this he said in
[49:46] every way he was a man he thought like a
[49:49] man he felt like a man he had
[49:50] temptations like a man
[49:52] but he was also god
[49:55] and he says and the father asked him
[49:57] will you go to that cross
[49:59] will you make this your decision
[50:01] and he said he wrestled it out in this
[50:03] conference with god and he said i will
[50:06] i'll do it
[50:07] so there in the garden of gethsethme he
[50:09] chose the cross
[50:11] where he laid down his will for the will
[50:12] of the father
[50:14] he said not my will thine will be done
[50:16] and he continued on
[50:18] and so this question i've had of myself
[50:21] should i call myself to a conference
[50:23] because i find in me both good and evil
[50:25] you find in you both very much flesh
[50:29] and yet very much god
[50:31] this is a mystery that's been unveiled
[50:33] to us that we actually can relate with
[50:36] that we know there's a aspect of you
[50:38] that's not god and you know it
[50:41] and i know it
[50:44] but there's very much an aspect of you
[50:45] that is
[50:47] very much
[50:48] and i know it and you know it
[50:51] and that's why i appreciate so much
[50:52] about the various body the various gifts
[50:54] that are in the body because i can
[50:55] recognize
[50:57] and i've had conversations with close
[50:58] brothers that know me very well and they
[51:00] know there's times when that's just kyle
[51:02] talking
[51:03] frustrated down concerned worried
[51:07] and then there's times when god speaks
[51:09] and it it's totally different
[51:12] and then so i find myself have we really
[51:14] come to that time in this omega ministry
[51:17] where god continues to work and to
[51:19] fulfill his great desire and fulfill
[51:21] those things that he left undone for his
[51:23] body to be fulfilled
[51:25] has he put us back in the position of
[51:27] the garden where we're calling ourselves
[51:29] to a conference
[51:30] and saying
[51:32] what cross did i pick up today
[51:34] how can i give him this preeminence how
[51:36] can he take his rest so that i can take
[51:39] mine
[51:40] you know when enoch took the rapture it
[51:42] wasn't like enoch did this all alone
[51:45] he was with somebody
[51:47] he was walking with the lord and he took
[51:48] a rapture you know when brother
[51:50] branham's body changed and he became a
[51:52] young man
[51:53] it wasn't because he was alone he was in
[51:55] the presence of the right person
[51:58] the presence of the right person asked
[52:00] him a question and said
[52:02] you want to walk with me he said lord be
[52:04] the greatest desire of my life
[52:07] right
[52:08] before then he had to make a decision
[52:11] and lord had to reveal to him you walk
[52:13] with too many
[52:15] if you're going to walk with me you walk
[52:16] alone from this point on
[52:18] and so much of us we just don't
[52:21] we know god calls us to those types i
[52:23] could totally i just talked to you like
[52:24] we're sitting at the table right is that
[52:25] okay
[52:26] and we know sometimes god calls us like
[52:28] that he whispers something to us says
[52:31] hey
[52:32] if you're gonna walk with me you gotta
[52:33] give that up
[52:34] you're gonna walk with me you can't keep
[52:36] doing that
[52:37] if you're gonna walk with me
[52:39] you have to separate
[52:40] why do you think moses god had to take
[52:43] or moses had to take the tabernacle
[52:45] outside of the camp to meet with god
[52:47] there comes a point in time where it's
[52:49] you and you only
[52:51] and it's him and him only and that is
[52:53] your place of rest that is his greatest
[52:56] desire and i think that's the
[52:58] rapture i believe that that's the
[53:01] rapture a place of rest a hiding place
[53:04] in him
[53:07] you know what i mean
[53:08] we are in rapture cycle i get it i know
[53:11] to wit the change in the body is the
[53:13] fullness of redemption but i'm looking
[53:16] at this rest and i'm realizing the
[53:17] earnest
[53:18] of my redemption was the holy spirit
[53:21] and the holy spirit guidance is leading
[53:24] me back behind the veil where the
[53:26] curtain can be shut
[53:28] and i'm with him alone
[53:31] then let the world do whatever it's
[53:32] going to do
[53:34] let it blow up let russia drop bombs and
[53:37] let the economies of the world collapse
[53:39] what do i care i've been shut in
[53:42] i'm shut in i'm closed in and it's just
[53:45] joy bells ringing for me
[53:48] because i know the one i put my
[53:50] confidence in he's promised i'll never
[53:52] leave you and i'll never forsake you
[53:53] i'll lead you i'll guide you don't you
[53:55] ever worry what do i have to worry about
[53:57] i'm in the palm of his hand
[54:00] so a believer's position in christ this
[54:02] true place of rest
[54:05] he says take my yoke upon you
[54:09] yoke yourself that means join yourself
[54:11] with me but remember i'm meek and i'm
[54:13] lowly you know god will never change in
[54:15] that nature
[54:17] he's not all of a sudden not ever going
[54:19] to be meek we're not going to get to
[54:20] heaven and realize he changes his mask
[54:22] and he's not meek any longer he is and
[54:25] will for always be a meek and gentle
[54:28] lamb
[54:29] that's what makes him so great
[54:32] he's so great he can make himself simple
[54:35] and that's why i think now we're at this
[54:36] point in time the bride has some
[54:38] decisions to make
[54:40] can she become this simple
[54:42] can she become this lowly
[54:44] can she not concern herself with just
[54:46] keeping up for him
[54:50] brother branham said why are the people
[54:51] so tossed about he said the christian
[54:53] faith is solidly based on rest
[54:55] that's it
[54:56] christian is not tossed about a
[54:58] christian doesn't run from place to
[55:00] praise
[55:01] a christian doesn't fuss and fume and
[55:03] worry about things a christian's at rest
[55:06] it's all over for him it was all
[55:08] finished for the believer on calvary
[55:11] it's all over
[55:15] he says but i find there's two types of
[55:17] christians he says not types phases
[55:22] he says this he says
[55:25] oh did i just leave it no
[55:27] he says these two types of christians
[55:29] seem strange he said i would say it's
[55:32] really two types or two phases would be
[55:34] a better use of the word not types to
[55:38] phases
[55:39] some christianities two phases to it one
[55:42] of them it's intellectual
[55:44] it's a mental conception of god
[55:48] god of what god has said in his word and
[55:51] of jesus christ by the way of knowledge
[55:54] and the other is experience that god has
[55:57] given the man in his heart
[56:00] the one intellectually he's hungry
[56:04] and feasting on god
[56:06] but his feasts just don't hold out
[56:09] the other one seems to have victory all
[56:12] the time
[56:13] there's nothing that bothers him he's as
[56:16] solid and anchored as there can be no
[56:19] trials and no storms can bother them at
[56:22] all
[56:23] that's the kind of christian i want to
[56:24] be
[56:25] i may not have all the answers and i may
[56:27] not know all the mysteries but i know
[56:29] what god did in my heart and by the
[56:30] grace of god i'm learning obedience
[56:32] through much suffering and i want that
[56:34] experience to continue to grow and grow
[56:36] and i want him to have the preeminence
[56:38] more and more
[56:40] can i continue
[56:43] just sitting around the table
[56:46] let me tell you something when you're
[56:47] worshiping god in spirit and truth
[56:50] when it becomes custom for you to do it
[56:54] because you think you ought to
[56:56] because you think that if i don't shout
[57:00] or don't jump up and down or i don't
[57:02] dance
[57:04] or the neighbor's going to think that
[57:06] i'm backslid
[57:08] then you are drinking from stagnated
[57:10] stream
[57:11] until it fills your every fiber until
[57:13] the holy spirit itself is bubbling in
[57:16] you i don't care whether the music is
[57:19] playing whether they're playing near my
[57:20] god to thee or whatever the holy spirit
[57:23] is still ringing out joy bells in your
[57:25] heart he's still satisfying that god
[57:28] that satisfies the portion anything else
[57:31] but that in your done
[57:35] you might speak with tongues of men and
[57:37] angels you might give all your goods to
[57:39] the poor you might prophesy you might
[57:42] have knowledge and you may understand
[57:44] all the mysteries and all things
[57:46] you have become tinkling you have become
[57:49] nothing
[57:50] you are until that satisfying something
[57:53] can come in there and quench that thirst
[57:56] like he said my soul thirsts for the
[57:58] living god like the heart is panting
[58:00] after the water brook unless i can find
[58:03] it i will perish you will get hungrier
[58:06] for god you will you will get hungry for
[58:09] god something is going to take place the
[58:12] holy spirit will lead you to that great
[58:14] fountain of god
[58:15] obviously to satisfy the thirst
[58:18] right
[58:19] there's just something about god when he
[58:22] comes into the individual he calms you
[58:23] down
[58:24] that was this purpose
[58:26] right when he the spirit of
[58:28] of truth is come when truth is made
[58:30] known and he's speaking to you and you
[58:31] know he's leading you how could you not
[58:33] rest
[58:35] how could you not rest when you see him
[58:37] look back through life and you see the
[58:39] decisions you made and you look how many
[58:41] things he brought you through how do you
[58:42] not rest
[58:44] my he knows the end in the beginning
[58:47] like david could say he knows my goings
[58:49] forth and my comings from he knows if i
[58:51] ascended up into heaven he's there if i
[58:53] go down to hell he's there he's with me
[58:55] david's saying no matter where i go he's
[58:58] with me
[59:00] so david could be at rest and he could
[59:02] write the 27th psalm and the prophet of
[59:04] god to this age could come back and pick
[59:06] it up and say there you go there's your
[59:08] rapture
[59:09] this man has hidden himself
[59:11] cleft behind the rock
[59:14] what does he care if wars and rumors of
[59:16] wars and enemies and everybody rejects
[59:19] him and all manner of evil is
[59:20] surrounding him what does he care he's
[59:23] walking with the king
[59:25] what does it matter
[59:29] he says a momentary consideration of
[59:31] church history will prove how accurate
[59:33] that this thought is that in the dark
[59:35] ages the word was almost entirely lost
[59:37] to a people but god sent forth luther
[59:39] with the word and the lutheran spoke for
[59:41] god but they organized and again the
[59:43] pure word was lost for organization and
[59:46] an organization tends towards dogma and
[59:49] creeds and not simple word and they
[59:51] could just no longer speak for god
[59:54] and so
[59:55] you know what dogma means
[59:57] a set of commonly held truths that's all
[1:00:00] it means a set of commonly held truths
[1:00:03] is dogma
[1:00:05] but i certainly hope you're not a
[1:00:06] believer because you're just walking
[1:00:08] with commonly held truths
[1:00:10] i pray and i believe with all my heart
[1:00:13] that the prophet of god came to fulfill
[1:00:15] one purpose which he said that was to
[1:00:17] join god and man again
[1:00:20] his purpose wasn't to build a church his
[1:00:22] purpose was not to draw people to
[1:00:24] himself his purpose was to see to it
[1:00:26] that god and man could become one again
[1:00:29] that was the purpose that was the
[1:00:30] objective that's the purpose of the
[1:00:32] ministry i think that's the purpose of
[1:00:34] any believer is they want to see god and
[1:00:36] man join when you witness to somebody
[1:00:38] you're not there to impress them with
[1:00:39] what you know you have a heart for the
[1:00:41] man you want to see that man get back in
[1:00:43] his position as a son of god restored to
[1:00:46] his father that he could walk like
[1:00:49] like a man that came from a kingdom
[1:00:51] somewhere else
[1:00:53] you know what i mean
[1:00:57] brother branham says this
[1:01:00] the key to success
[1:01:03] was dividing and conquering
[1:01:06] he says now we know that the wounded
[1:01:07] head of pagan the of the pagan empire
[1:01:10] this great political world power his
[1:01:12] head rose up again this roman catholic
[1:01:15] spiritual empire now watch it carefully
[1:01:18] what did political pagan rome do that
[1:01:21] was the basis for her success she
[1:01:24] divided and conquered
[1:01:26] that was the seed of rome to divide and
[1:01:29] conquer
[1:01:30] now her iron teeth devout tore and
[1:01:33] devour whom she tore and devoured they
[1:01:35] could not rise again
[1:01:37] the same iron teeth remained in her when
[1:01:40] she arose as the false church her
[1:01:42] policies have always remained the same
[1:01:45] divide and conquer this is nicolaitanism
[1:01:49] and god hates it
[1:01:51] absolutely utterly hates it
[1:01:55] what did the devil do in the beginning
[1:01:57] he came to eve and separated her from
[1:02:00] the simple word that she had confidence
[1:02:02] in
[1:02:03] and when he said brother brown said they
[1:02:05] only had a few words to keep
[1:02:07] and when the devil could come in and
[1:02:09] create in her an insecurity
[1:02:13] and insecurity
[1:02:14] to thirst for something than what god
[1:02:16] had given her he could slip in the trap
[1:02:20] and so
[1:02:21] you think we're living in
[1:02:23] insecure times
[1:02:25] yeah
[1:02:27] yeah
[1:02:29] do you think the devil has given up on
[1:02:30] trying to trip you up no no
[1:02:33] no no
[1:02:34] he'll try to create an insecurity so he
[1:02:36] can slip in a little
[1:02:39] lie
[1:02:39] get you to believe something that draws
[1:02:41] you away from a simple humble faith in a
[1:02:44] simple pure word that god never fails
[1:02:46] and he always keeps his word
[1:02:49] like i don't know how to make it any
[1:02:50] more simple
[1:02:52] come unto me i'll give you rest
[1:02:55] but you won't do that if you don't
[1:02:56] believe it
[1:02:57] but if you do believe it you will
[1:03:00] and you'll yoke yourself with this
[1:03:02] simple humble word
[1:03:03] you'll take an approach that's meek and
[1:03:05] lowly
[1:03:06] and you'll follow him wherever he goes
[1:03:09] and along the way he will never force
[1:03:11] you but he'll give you opportunities to
[1:03:13] make some very hard decisions that you
[1:03:16] could pick up your cross
[1:03:19] and follow him
[1:03:20] by your own choosing
[1:03:23] right because thou has walked in thine
[1:03:25] own choosing now has chosen the harder
[1:03:27] way right
[1:03:29] you've walked in your own choosing and a
[1:03:31] great portion of heaven awaits thee
[1:03:33] right
[1:03:34] and i got to thinking this you know
[1:03:35] remember brother branham went behind the
[1:03:36] veil i'm sorry it's okay still okay
[1:03:38] right you're quiet on me but
[1:03:41] if at the dinner table sometimes they
[1:03:42] speak back so before long
[1:03:46] brother bannon goes behind the veil
[1:03:49] and when he gets behind the veil
[1:03:51] he says i want to see jesus
[1:03:53] and he says oh he'll come to you
[1:03:56] you are a leader he says oh
[1:03:58] he says uh will he come to paul he said
[1:04:00] oh yes he'll come to paul he said well
[1:04:03] good
[1:04:03] i preached exactly what paul preached
[1:04:06] what did the people say
[1:04:08] all of them
[1:04:11] all of them with one voice said one
[1:04:13] thing we are resting on that
[1:04:18] we we are resting
[1:04:20] we're not striving we're not laboring we
[1:04:24] are resting in this word that you
[1:04:26] preached was the truth
[1:04:28] and we've put our souls and we've yoked
[1:04:30] with it and we go with it wherever it
[1:04:33] leads us to go
[1:04:34] we bear it
[1:04:36] with honor
[1:04:37] you know what i
[1:04:38] mean so i'd ask you
[1:04:42] are you resting
[1:04:45] are you laboring
[1:04:46] are you fearful or are you concerned
[1:04:49] are you just resting in the palm of his
[1:04:51] hand realizing i've been watching over
[1:04:53] you every day of your life
[1:04:55] i've been thinking about you constantly
[1:04:57] i know exactly where you are i know
[1:04:58] exactly where you've been i know exactly
[1:05:00] where you're going
[1:05:02] i've been preparing you for your own
[1:05:04] decision from before the foundation of
[1:05:06] the world where you would give me a
[1:05:07] place of rest
[1:05:09] so that you could take yours
[1:05:11] you know what i mean
[1:05:16] brother branham makes the comment and
[1:05:17] you all know this
[1:05:20] he said all hell is against
[1:05:23] this mystery
[1:05:24] he said it goes right by them and they
[1:05:26] don't recognize it until it's gone and
[1:05:28] it only picks up a predestinated seed
[1:05:30] that god has predestinated from before
[1:05:32] the foundation of the world the same
[1:05:34] thing came through in the days of
[1:05:36] knowing the same thing came through in
[1:05:38] the days of moses elijah in the days of
[1:05:39] the prophets and of jesus and down
[1:05:41] through this very own hour the pregnant
[1:05:44] person with the seed of god
[1:05:46] and the word in there manifesting itself
[1:05:50] not manufacturing
[1:05:53] anything
[1:05:54] not trying to be a believer not trying
[1:05:57] to live a christian life
[1:06:00] humbly believing accepting the word and
[1:06:02] it's producing its own life
[1:06:06] nothing i am doing
[1:06:08] nothing you ever have to do
[1:06:10] you just believe it you accept it and it
[1:06:13] produces its own life
[1:06:15] every seed brings forth of its own kind
[1:06:18] what does it have to do nothing
[1:06:21] all the seed does is really drink in
[1:06:23] water and it pushes out a life that's
[1:06:25] all it's ever had to do
[1:06:28] he says not say my church now my church
[1:06:31] your church has nothing to do with it
[1:06:33] this is an individual one person and all
[1:06:36] hell is against this teaching all hell
[1:06:38] is against this truth but it is the
[1:06:40] truth jesus never did say now peter
[1:06:43] james you and john the rest of you
[1:06:45] no you've got the revelation and the
[1:06:48] whole church is and the whole church is
[1:06:49] safe no
[1:06:51] it was to him personally and i say unto
[1:06:53] thee not to them to thee thou art peter
[1:06:56] and upon this rock i build my church and
[1:06:58] the word peter means little stone or a
[1:07:00] confessed one and or a separated one
[1:07:03] so all hell was against
[1:07:06] you
[1:07:07] as an individual
[1:07:09] making him your place of rest
[1:07:12] man you could do a lot of good things
[1:07:14] for god but don't give him preeminence
[1:07:16] my goodness that's the one thing like go
[1:07:18] to church every wednesday night go to
[1:07:19] every go to every meeting and sing very
[1:07:22] loudly but do not give him preeminence
[1:07:26] you realize that's the thing that the
[1:07:27] devil doesn't want you to do
[1:07:29] do it all else say amen to everything
[1:07:32] but just keep a couple of decisions for
[1:07:34] yourself
[1:07:36] there's a couple little spots this is
[1:07:38] mine
[1:07:39] i that now this is me that i gotta hold
[1:07:42] on to this
[1:07:46] that's all it takes guys
[1:07:48] just disbelieve one word
[1:07:50] what's all hell against the individual
[1:07:53] giving him preeminences over every
[1:07:56] decision
[1:07:57] and you cannot do it unless you love him
[1:07:59] because that love will produce a
[1:08:00] confidence and that confidence will
[1:08:02] produce a faith and that faith will
[1:08:03] produce a rapture
[1:08:05] and a place of rest for the individual
[1:08:08] amazing ain't it
[1:08:09] really something to think about
[1:08:12] so
[1:08:13] i told you my direction
[1:08:15] that's all the notes i have
[1:08:17] what else am i going to do
[1:08:19] i can say brother ben your turn
[1:08:23] but i believe i said what i i was
[1:08:24] supposed to say
[1:08:28] i'm just going to see if i have anything
[1:08:30] else here that i could
[1:08:33] no
[1:08:34] no i think that's it everyone
[1:08:36] let me think
[1:08:39] one more
[1:08:40] just found it
[1:08:45] brother ben says about jesus
[1:08:48] he said there come another adam which
[1:08:50] was christ
[1:08:51] never a one like him somebody says he is
[1:08:54] he he wasn't god
[1:08:56] but his uniqueness proved he was god
[1:08:59] there never was a creature like him he
[1:09:01] lived in a world to himself
[1:09:04] he was born outside of the realm of the
[1:09:06] natural sinful man
[1:09:09] hallelujah he was the creator himself
[1:09:11] made flesh
[1:09:13] who could ever stand where he stood
[1:09:16] i think that's a question
[1:09:18] who could ever stand where he stood
[1:09:20] who could ever talk like he talked who
[1:09:23] could ever say the things that he said
[1:09:25] who could ever do the things that he had
[1:09:26] done
[1:09:28] his uniqueness proved that he was god
[1:09:31] there wasn't a prophet or nothing else
[1:09:32] could do what he had done
[1:09:34] who could call the dead back to the
[1:09:36] grave who could stop the skies and do
[1:09:39] anything he wanted to he was god
[1:09:42] who could ever stand in his place
[1:09:45] what could he be but the perfect
[1:09:47] immortal god in flesh that dwelt among
[1:09:50] us
[1:09:51] nothing ever compared with him he lived
[1:09:54] in a world all to himself
[1:09:58] and this life this life of jesus if it
[1:10:01] ever puts forth another body of
[1:10:03] believers
[1:10:04] it will bear the same fruit that the
[1:10:06] first one did
[1:10:09] so my question
[1:10:10] who can do what he did
[1:10:14] if that vine puts forth another branch
[1:10:16] that vine the fruit of that vine will do
[1:10:18] the exact same thing he did
[1:10:21] it will look at any obstacle in any
[1:10:23] situation and say not my will
[1:10:26] but my father's will be done
[1:10:29] i believe the potentials are there
[1:10:31] it's just decision time
[1:10:34] god is known in simplicity and the
[1:10:36] revelation of jesus christ to the most
[1:10:38] illiterate person don't that make you
[1:10:40] say amen
[1:10:42] illiterate
[1:10:43] see not your theology but a revelation
[1:10:45] of jesus christ and upon this rock i'll
[1:10:47] build my church and no other rocks are
[1:10:50] accepted and no anything else is
[1:10:52] accepted no other roman rock protestant
[1:10:54] rock or other school no nothing but
[1:10:57] exactly the revelation of jesus christ
[1:10:59] through a new birth he's born in there
[1:11:01] and he injects his own life and your
[1:11:03] life is gone
[1:11:05] and the life of christ is projecting
[1:11:07] itself through you with preeminences
[1:11:10] to the people that they see the very
[1:11:13] life
[1:11:14] and works and signs and wonders that he
[1:11:18] did is doing the very same thing through
[1:11:21] you
[1:11:22] outside of that the rest is not even
[1:11:26] called into it god's great revelation is
[1:11:30] unfolding
[1:11:31] by lack of this revelation is why we
[1:11:34] have so many divisions among us and so
[1:11:37] much mockery and so much division
[1:11:40] it is because people lack that
[1:11:42] revelation see they lack that revelation
[1:11:46] so here's here's a little tidbit
[1:11:52] the bible says one man keepeth the day
[1:11:54] as unto the lord and another doesn't
[1:11:56] keep a day as unto the lord you know
[1:11:58] that scripture
[1:11:59] and another one he eateth meat as unto
[1:12:01] the lord but this other one he doesn't
[1:12:02] eateth meat has unto the lord so let me
[1:12:05] ask you a question should we do like
[1:12:06] some of the disciples did that said hey
[1:12:08] lord
[1:12:10] they're preaching but they're not with
[1:12:12] our group we should call down fire from
[1:12:13] heaven and burn them up
[1:12:16] and jesus said what spirit's on you
[1:12:20] leave him alone
[1:12:21] let them go
[1:12:23] just let them go if they're not against
[1:12:25] us they're for us just let them go you
[1:12:26] know
[1:12:27] and so these things you know
[1:12:29] we're not
[1:12:31] um
[1:12:32] we're not okay because we believe a
[1:12:33] certain doctrine
[1:12:35] you know sometimes people don't
[1:12:36] understand things i certainly don't
[1:12:38] understand a lot of things i'm learning
[1:12:40] every day and the more i know the more i
[1:12:42] know i don't know
[1:12:44] and i remember to realize i'm just a
[1:12:45] canary brain and i only know what he
[1:12:46] tells me anyhow so at the end of the day
[1:12:48] i might as well just serve god with the
[1:12:50] best i know how. and i better leave
[1:12:52] everybody else alone because they're
[1:12:53] trying to serve god the best they know
[1:12:54] how and if i could be a help to them
[1:12:56] i'll try to be a help and an example in
[1:12:58] any way i can but outside of that who am
[1:13:00] i to tell them
[1:13:02] you know what i mean in some
[1:13:04] certain situations like that you've had
[1:13:06] to go back and i've had to go back and
[1:13:07] say
[1:13:09] you know what god bless them anyhow
[1:13:11] and i mean it sincerely
[1:13:13] god help them god bless them because
[1:13:15] they know i know i need my help too
[1:13:17] help me to express help me to make these
[1:13:19] hard decisions in my life i don't want
[1:13:21] to be one that's just rallying around a
[1:13:22] group of people that we we've all
[1:13:24] claimed to believe a certain set of
[1:13:25] dogmas
[1:13:27] a certain set of truths
[1:13:28] and now i find confidence because i'm a
[1:13:30] part of the right group that's
[1:13:32] insecurity
[1:13:33] the only security i'll ever have is when
[1:13:35] jesus christ is personally made known to
[1:13:37] me in this revelation and i begin to
[1:13:39] express that revelation not of my own
[1:13:41] will but because the life that's in me
[1:13:44] is expressing itself
[1:13:47] and then i can have a confidence
[1:13:50] will you stand and musicians will you
[1:13:51] come
[1:13:52] i told you i go until i run out of
[1:13:55] things to say
[1:13:56] and i ran out of things to
[1:13:58] say do you understand what i was saying
[1:14:01] though
[1:14:02] you understand the direction all i had
[1:14:04] was a direction for you all
[1:14:06] but i do believe it was of god
[1:14:08] i believe it was his grace to us
[1:14:11] help us not to get
[1:14:14] help us to understand what his great
[1:14:16] desire was
[1:14:17] a rest a real rest in an individual
[1:14:21] and understand where i get my rest
[1:14:23] i get my rest in doing the will of god
[1:14:26] i don't get my rest from knowing
[1:14:27] something
[1:14:28] i get my rest from being in his presence
[1:14:31] in his presence is where i'm wanting
[1:14:34] to be and to live i don't want to go in
[1:14:37] and out of that one
[1:14:38] i believe the shekinah glory the curtain
[1:14:40] shut behind him and shut him in behind
[1:14:43] it
[1:14:44] and he was shut in behind the veil with
[1:14:45] god
[1:14:47] and that's where god wanted him and
[1:14:48] that's where the man wanted to be
[1:14:50] and that's where i want to be and that's
[1:14:51] where i all want us to be you all want
[1:14:53] to be there
[1:14:55] decisions to be made but i'm so thankful
[1:14:58] that we have an almighty god that would
[1:15:00] be so kind
[1:15:02] and so concerning of us to just say why
[1:15:04] don't you just come take some rest
[1:15:07] that to me is just a wonderful thing and
[1:15:09] the hour in which we're living when
[1:15:10] there's weariness and distractions and
[1:15:13] concern and fear all around
[1:15:15] your father whispers hey
[1:15:17] come relax
[1:15:19] just just relax right here under my
[1:15:22] presence in my presence don't worry
[1:15:24] everything is fine
[1:15:26] amen let's just have a word of prayer
[1:15:29] here
[1:15:30] heavenly father we just come before you
[1:15:32] lord we always are appreciative of the
[1:15:34] word that you've given us
[1:15:36] and lord of your presence it's so simple
[1:15:38] sometimes but you said it would be
[1:15:41] you said it'd be so simple that a fool
[1:15:43] should not air in
[1:15:45] sometimes in our own
[1:15:48] messed up ways we over complicate things
[1:15:51] we over complicate you that's what made
[1:15:52] you so great was because you could
[1:15:54] become so simple
[1:15:56] and men tends to do this
[1:15:58] and it's our even our own fallen nature
[1:16:00] that begins to try to make you something
[1:16:02] greater
[1:16:03] than what you're trying to be simple for
[1:16:05] the people what a great god you really
[1:16:07] truly are
[1:16:08] lord and i just pray that you would help
[1:16:10] each and every one of us to understand
[1:16:12] the simplicity that is found in trusting
[1:16:14] you
[1:16:15] it's not him that willeth or him that
[1:16:16] runeth it was god that showed us mercy
[1:16:18] and lord each and every one of us could
[1:16:20] lift up our hands bow our heads and say
[1:16:22] lord
[1:16:23] where would i be if you wouldn't have
[1:16:25] come towards me
[1:16:26] it wasn't us pressing towards you
[1:16:29] what could we do and of ourselves we
[1:16:32] can't add one inch to our stature nor
[1:16:34] could we add one hair to our head the
[1:16:36] bible says we can do nothing
[1:16:39] how can we take a complete and utter
[1:16:41] body change
[1:16:43] unless we're just taking a step day by
[1:16:45] day walking in your presence with your
[1:16:47] word and lord you're bidding us to come
[1:16:49] to do that what an honor it is to each
[1:16:51] and every one of us
[1:16:53] father i pray that you would help us
[1:16:55] i pray that you'd give us all wisdom i
[1:16:57] pray that you would give us all of your
[1:16:59] nature and of your life
[1:17:01] father so that the things that you left
[1:17:02] undone
[1:17:03] for this day in this age and for the
[1:17:05] fulfillment of your body could be done
[1:17:07] in each and every one of us
[1:17:08] for the glory of god and not our own
[1:17:12] lord may things be done that you had in
[1:17:13] the back parts of your mind that you
[1:17:15] wanted to see accomplished be done and
[1:17:17] the simplicity of a housewife
[1:17:20] simplicity of a
[1:17:21] farmer of a mechanic

[1:17:25] their
[1:17:26] their their purpose in life making you
[1:17:29] there giving you the preeminences and
