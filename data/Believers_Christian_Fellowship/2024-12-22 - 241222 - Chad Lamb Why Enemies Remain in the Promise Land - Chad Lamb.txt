events and all kinds of we'll probably all find ourselves in all kinds of different situations but I pray that God will bless you and let his light shine through you wherever you find yourself in this next week and may we never forget amen that that what God has done for us when he came himself and brother B said Jehovah laying in a Manger I don't comprehend that myself but I know that God lowered himself humbled himself for me and he deserves our devotion and our worship and our praise we don't want to ever forget that in all the festivities amen also want to remind you that the watch Night Service will be the following Tuesday on the 31st will begin at 8:00 pm if you would like to share a special with the congregation please just let brother Mike Bower know so he can get it on the list so that we can uh make sure that uh we have everything in order so God bless you we're looking forward to that as well and while you're standing let's turn together to the Book of Exodus the book of Exodus verse or chapter 23 I'm cont contining on with the thought that I was on last time that I ministered and uh we had talked about the responsibility of the adopted and we really typed it with the Israelites taking the land and possessing the land and driving off the enemies and the things that God had given them to do what their responsibility was but I'm going to go just a little further uh a little further in this uh let's look here at Exodus 23 uh verse 23 23 and 23 says for my angel shall go before thee and bring thee into the amorites and the Hittites and the perizzites and the Canaanites and the hivites and the jebusites and I will cut them off Thou shalt not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works but Thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images and you shall serve the Lord your God and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee there shall nothing cast their young nor be Barren in the land uh Barren in thy land the number of thy days will I fulfill I will fulfill I will send my fear before thee and I will destroy all the people to whom Thou shalt come and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee and I will send Hornets before thee which shall drive out the hivite the Canaanite the the hittite from before thee and I will not drive them out from before thee in one year lest thy land become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against thee by little and little I will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land may God bless you as you take your seats amen amen we'll just ask God to bless us as we share what's on our heart that he'll have absolute control amen so when we when we look back at the subject of The Exodus and The Taking of the land and the Israelites moving into the promise that God gave to them and they had a responsib to take the land and we know that in some ways they failed to do all that God had required of them to do and I'd like to just look for a subject tonight look at the thought of why enemies remain in the promised land why enemies remain in the promised land and we obviously we're going to use that as a parallel for our lives in the day we live in why enemies remain in the promised land because we realize that there's still some enemies that remain among us and so we want to look at that and uh just to let the cat out of the bag I think there's various reasons for that we're not going to look at just one reason that God's always accomplishing many things and he always has a diversity of ways in which he operates God is actually multiac faceted and quite complex you can't you can't simplify God down in any situation and say God is doing this in this situation because God is usually doing multiple things in every situation God is working somebody else's life your life he's maturing you he's correcting you he's doing all kinds of stuff he's preparing you for the next trial there's a multifaceted things going on on so as we look at this I believe there's multiple reasons that enemies remain in the land amen and we may not even be able to explore all of them we probably haven't even had our mind open to everything that God did in his word amen because God is so deep and so rich and it touches everything amen but we just want to look at a few things that we're able to see and when we look here in uh uh let's look back here verse 27 that we just read I will send my fear before thee and I will destroy all the people to whom Thou shalt come and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee and I will send Hornets before thee which shall drive out the hivite and the canite the hittite from before Thee I will not drive them out from before thee in one year lest the land become desolate and the Beast of the field multiply against thee by little and little will I drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land before God ever sent him there he told them this isn't going to be instant this isn't going to be you give your heart to the Lord You're filled with the Holy Ghost and everything's vanished amen everything that ever troubled you everything that you ever had a problem with everything you ever struggle with it's all immediately gone but he says no but little by little I'll drive them out as you're able to take the land amen and we realize that there's things there's realities in the gospel there's truths Amen in the word of God that God wants us to grab a hold of and he wants us to stand on he wants us to have the word and manifest the word amen but there's things in our lives that we're not ready to manifest yet there's truths that we can't grasp there's things that are too deep for us and God Amen is driving back amen the enemy little by little so that we can possess more and more and manifest more and more amen I told you this before but when we first come to the message amen I realized I begin to hear the message and begin to realize my life was nowhere close to what God desired for his sons to be and how he desired for his sons to live and I remember all the massive changes that took place in my life as I changed the way I dress and I changed the associations I had I changed beliefs I I cut the cable television out then I kicked the television out all together and and we went through all of these changes in our lives and they were massive changes amen but then we realized hey hey we we turned our life around amen we got rid of all the enemies we we we now are are a vessel that God's using we now Sanctified our home and Sanctified our lives and we've done all these things and then you know you think ah we've got Victory it's all over but then you realize there's still enemies in the land begin to realize now we got rid of so many external things and so many tripping things that tripped us up and things that weren't pleasing to God but then God started working down on the inside of us and we realized there's things there that aren't right either there's things that are still tripping me up and fighting me in mind battles and and things from the past and things from my childhood and traditional ways of think there were still enemies in the land amen and God was driving them out little by little and I think he's still driving them out for me we're realizing as we go deeper and deeper within ourselves amen we're finding more places that God wants to manifest himself because he wants preeminence in all of us and so God's working deeper and deeper inside of us and we realized when Israel could not drive out the inhabitants we're going to look at that again in a way of review but I just want to note that God told them ahead of time this wasn't going to be short it wasn't going to be instant but I was going to do it little by little but yet he promised to do it amen let's go to Exodus 34 Exodus 34 and verse 11 says observe that thou which I commanded thee this day behold I drive out before Thee the Amorite and the Canaanite and the hittite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite take heed to thyself lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whether thou goest lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee but ye shall destroy their altars break down their images and cut down their Groves so God tells them go down and utterly destroy them and destroy all of their worship and and he he warns them to do this ahead of time and we find out that they fail in this warning uh let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 11 yeah Deuteronomy 11 verse 22 Deuteronomy 11:22 for if you shall diligently keep all these Commandments which I command you to do them to love the Lord your God to walk in all his ways and to cleave unto him then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you and ye shall possess greater Nations and mightier than yourselves every place wherein the soul of your feet shall tread shall be yours from the Wilderness and Lebanon from the river the river Euphrates even unto the OS sea shall your Coast be there shall no man be able to stand before you for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land and you shall tread upon that that you shall tread upon as he hath said unto you so we talked last time about the the the uh commission that was given to them to go possess the land God brought them up not to just not to just give them the land he did give them the land but he told them to possess the land that's an important terminology amen God can say you know I give you the land just walk into the land and sit upon it and enjoy but no they to go possess it they had to make it their land amen and in order to possess the land they had to drive out whoever was holding on to it and whoever was hindering them from possessing it that was their job but God says I'll do it I'll drive them out then he says you drive them out but he already said I'll drive them out and so we find that God was working in and through his people and for and on behalf of his people he was doing it all he was working through them and he was working for them and he was working side by side with them he was working where they couldn't work if they worked where they could work yeah amen so this was God's promise but he told them that you're to possess the land and then he told them that wherever The Souls of your foot shall tread that will I give you so possession meant a perseverance meant op pressing amen you had to actually go take the land God says it's yours but you must go tread upon it amen and the tread upon it wasn't a leisurely lot walk through the park saying this is mine and this is mine and this is mine because there were inhabitants on that land and in order order for you to to to in order for you to possess that land and tread upon it you had to fight off Whoever thought it was theirs amen praise be to God and so that was the commission that was given to them brother B says uh this God told them way down in Egypt I give you that land but he didn't say I'll go out there and sweep it all out and garnish the houses and hang up the curtains and everything you all just move in no no they had to fight for every inch of ground they took that's right fighting and take it by every fight every inch but he said everywhere The Souls of your foot land that's possession footsteps is possession that's the same thing it is today Divine Healing belongs to us the Holy Spirit belongs to us it's our property but you'll fight every inch of it yes sir but brother footsteps is possession just keep fighting take it the devil says the days of Miracles has passed say you're a liar God said he's the same yesterday today and forever take it over everywhere your footsteps that that's possession that's right amen oh praise God we thought it was going to be easy we got the message of the hour we got the power that's come back the fullness of the Holy Ghost amen we've got all these promises and God's called us to be his bride amen we'll just go in and take it oh friends it's been a fight the whole way amen listen there there has been enemies that's been working against us possessing this this land some of those enemies have been working generationally in your life amen they've been working you know through Grandma and Grandpa and Mom and Dad and there's certain things amen that that are that are things that are complexes or temperaments or or or our genetic uh predispositions that have been working down through our lives and they come into us and we find ourselves amen with the same kind of problem mom had or the same kind of problem dad had or the same kind of problem grandpa had and we find our ourselves with this in this flesh body and these things are are hindrances to us fulfilling the fullness of the word and they're things that must be driven out of our land things that we can't just uh cope with or deal with or act like they're not there but we must resist some of these things and the devil thinks he's got a right yeah because it's generational did it with Grandpa and Grandpa get with Mom and Dad you can say but I'm not letting it it's not going to be so easy I'm not just going to roll over and let that thing control me you know if I've got to fight with it every day of my life I'm still going to fight with it I'm going to resist it amen I'm not just going to roll over and say well that's the way mom was and that's the way I am it's not okay with me amen I don't want to be this way I want to be all that God designed for me to be amen we're going to we're going to look at that a lot more as we move on but let's just keep doing our little review here let's go go to judges now Judges chapter 1 judges chap 1: 18 says also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof and ascalon with the coast thereof and erron with the coast thereof and the Lord was with Judah and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain but he could not drive out the inhabit Ence of the valley because they had Chariots of iron and they gave Hein unto Caleb as Moses had said and he expelled then the three sons of aning so we find that they're already having tremendous victories listen when they moved into the land they had tremendous victories they routed huge armies they they displaced huge numbers of people amen they utterly destroyed and wiped out all kinds of places but they got to certain places and in certain places they could not have victory they would wipe out armies they would wipe out Coalition of forces that would come together with four or five Kings at a time and they would utterly destroy them and heue them to the ground but then they come to places amen where these Canaanites were deeply embedded and they got to these places where they just couldn't drive them out but they had to remember God said I'll drive them out little by little don't get discouraged he's promised that they'll go but they might go little by little amen it's not it's not outside the word of God Amen let's look at verse 27 now neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of bethen and her towns nor tanak and her towns nor the inhabitants of D in her towns nor the inhabitants of IAM in her towns nor the inhabitants of megiddo in her towns but the Canaanites uh would dwell in the land and it came to pass when Israel was strong that they put the Canaanites to Tribute ah it's amazing when they when they became strong they put the Canaanites in tribute what a trap what a trap when they became strong when they had a lot of the land when they had overcome a whole bunch of it but we couldn't overcome this but we're strong and we're stronger than this so we're going to put it under tribute my oh my what a trap and it came to pass with the Israel was strong that they put the Canaanites to Tribute and did not utterly drive them out oh what a shame that's where they failed they didn't fa it wasn't a failure that they couldn't drive them out that was no failure they didn't fail because they could not overcome them they they failed because they quit trying to overcome them there is no failure in not being able to drive them out because they had iron chariots they were embedded they had walled cities they had places they they just weren't able to do it in one place they would wipe out everybody by the power of God they weren't fighting by themselves they were fighting with God God was fighting with them and in them amen it wasn't their own power it was God working in them and they would have tremendous victories then they get to another place and they can't have Victory amen the the reality was they it wasn't them by themselves that had Victory it was God with them and now if Victory is withheld with them amen it does doesn't mean that they failed it just means that Victory is delayed it can't God's promise Can't Fail amen so that means victory's delayed what do you do when victory's delayed you keep fighting amen not not saying we can't overcome well the truth is you never could overcome it wasn't you that overcome to begin with it was God in you through you and around you and for you it was God that was overcoming it was never you so when you come up to the Canaanite that's deeply embedded in a place that you can't drive them out amen don't say I can't drive them out well that's true you couldn't drive anybody out you can say well I got rid of this in my life and I got rid of this in my life and I overcame this in my life but I can't overcome this in my life the reality is you didn't overcome anything in your life you resisted the devil according to the word and by the power of the spirit those things were driven out of your life you didn't do it by yourself amen you did it because he told you to do it but he gave you the power to do it and he made it come to pass and now when we come up against something an obstacle that we can't seem to drive out then all of a sudden we say I can't when you say I can't drive them out I mean really what you're saying is I could drive them out but I can't drive these out see the problem is we focus so much on ourselves I could overcome this but I can't overcome this no God helped you overcome this and God will help you overcome the other there amen amen cuz God's got a purpose in everything God has a perfect plan we realize that nothing's getting all out of kilter with God God's not losing control of situations and so we we have to be careful in the way we approach it and that we don't ever just give in now we're going to talk a little bit further about things that God permits to remain and the purpose that they have and me we're going to talk about that because that's that's very much how God works uh so God became angry with Israel because he wasn't angry because they couldn't drive out the Canaanites he was angry because they put them under tribute which they made a peace league with them and says we're stronger than you we've got you under control we're not going to wipe you out we'll leave you alone you leave us alone you just stay out of our way that was the league and we know it never worked because those they made a league with eventually grew and become the ones that overcame them in judges chap 2 verse1 we'll look at a couple more verses here in judges in Judges chapter 2 vers1 it says and an angel of the Lord came up from gilgal to bacham and said I made you to go up out of Egypt and I have brought brought you unto the land which I swore unto your fathers and I said I will never break my Covenant with you and you shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land you shall throw down their altars but you have not obeyed my voice why have you done this wherefore I also said I will not drive them out from before you but they shall be as thorns in your sides and their God shall be as a snare unto you and it shall come to pass when the angel of the Lord spake these words unto all the children of Israel that the people lifted up their voice and wept amen let's turn from there uh there was one more scripture I want to read no no I've got a quote I'm going to read but we're going to go stay in judges we're going to come back to that in a minute and the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother bam makes this statement that's super interesting to me he says now we come back here and to visit the climate in this place I certainly don't like cuz it just breaks me down as soon as I get here I can cross the top of the knobs up there and come down in this Valley and I'm here about 10 minutes and I got hives and get sick weather swimmy-headed everything looks spooky dark I just have to get out of it see and the other day I was talking to the wife what what but what brings me in first what brings me in here is you people see this church I tell you of all the places I ever went in my life this is my favorite place to come preach the gospel and it looks like that we can make a tape from here that 10 times better than anywhere else see see that's the reason I say where God is doing something then stay right with it but I think where the great thing is that was me failing to go out the first time when he called me and therefore he makes it kind of rough on me when I come in obedience is better than sacrifice this is what I want to spend a little bit of time looking on brother brandham come to a place in his life when he was in mishala Indiana and he was up there on a fishing trip and he come back through and we know the story where he saw all the signs uh that said Jesus only Jesus only there was a Convention of the Jesus only Pentecostal movement and he went into the meeting and he was just enthralled with what he saw and what he heard and and then he was asked to come and preach and we know the experience that he had he just lost himself in preaching and afterwards he had a whole stack of invitations from all over the nation and he goes home and when he goes home he tells his wife and his wife is excited because it looks like God's moving in the ministry and they went and talked to to his mother-in-law and his mother-in-law just just rung him out she just told him what four and this and that and you're not going to drag my daughter all over amongst those people and drag these children from Pillar To Post and brother Benham left there defeated because of the words of his mother-in-law and even his wife told him says don't listen we'll just go on anyway and he said no no we don't want to upset her and he turned down the first call and when he turned down the first call that's what he's saying here but I think where the great thing is that was me failing to go out the first time when he called me and therefore he makes it kind of rough on me when I come in obedience is better than sacrifice this is what I'm I was beginning to look at and all of this and realize that God told the nation of Israel I'll drive them out you possess the land footsteps are possession I'll go before you I'll fight with you all of these but when they when they failed to fully obey the word and put them under leag he says I'll no longer drive them out but there'll be thorns in your side and then you say my goodness why is there thorns in their side forever and they'll become a prick to them and they'll become an irritant and they'll become a problem for them and we find brother brandham in the same exact spot the same spot as the whole nation of Israel now he's got an irritant and a prick and a thorn he's got this situation where he'll go off preaching everywhere else but when he comes back to his favorite place in all the world to preach the place he wants to be the people he wants to be with the place where his ministry is effective and he can make a tape that seems to be 10 times better than anywhere else when he comes back home and he comes back to the place now all of a sudden there's this Thorn and this prick he gets sick he breaks out in hives he gets swimmy-headed he starts feeling awful and why is he feeling awful he says because I didn't go out the first place obedience is better than sacrifice amen begin to realize when God left the inhabitants of the land to be a prick and a snare and a thorn to them that was love you would think that his love would take them away but his love let them stay you think for the prophet of God who sacrificed his life to God and gave up so much and and served God all over the world that God would make it easy on him when we come back home to his favorite place to preach at least when he comes back there he could have some peace but no when he comes back there because he failed to go the first time now when he comes back to what would be his favorite place he has this little Thorn this little irritant that he breaks out in hives gets sick and swimmy-headed why because he said obedience is better than sacrifice and God Amen would allow something to remain in the prophet's life that would remind the prophet the best thing in your life is to do what I say the very best thing that you could ever do is just obey because obedience is better than sacrifice and it's the love of God sometimes that will leave an irritant in our life because of our mistake and our failure to remind us amen why because God's love amen we we find God's love and obedience to his word God doesn't just give us his word and his Commandments amen just to make us do things and jump through hoops he tells us things for our benefit for our blessing because it's the best way to live because it's it it'll serve his purpose because it'll give Victory to ourselves and many many people and when we defy that word and we reject that word it's going to cause harm to numerous amounts of people and to ourselves so the very love of God will allow us in a mistake to have a thorn and to leave the thorn in our life so that we remember the best thing for me to do is keep his word and that's God's love it looks like it's punishment it looks like it's just punishment just just reprimand and indefinitely no friends that's God's love amen you know there's many of us that are suffering things because of our failure there's many of us that still suffer things because we knew better and we did it anyways we knew better and we chose another path we knew better we did it and some of those things are things you cannot erase right some of those sins that we commit in the body some of the things we do against our family and it leaves a little something amen and that something is something we can never get away from even if it's in our mind even it's a Memory even if it's a a a something in the family that causes a little Strife or tension or an area amen that we can't never get away from that but i' like to say tonight that that's the love of God Amen because we reminds us hey hey this thing is something I deserve yeah right because of what I did it's not what God did to me this is what I did yeah right and God's love doesn't just brush it away easily and just erase it but God's love lets it stay there so his love can be manifest in me because his love is his word to me and if I keep his word I abide in his love and and everything that he wants for my life will transpire amen praise God but I'd like to say it this this way too that's no reason to quit that's no reason to give up that's no reason to stop pushing back that's no reason to quit praying for deliverance amen let's just be real we say this is my fault this is not God's fault it's my fault I did this I caused this pain I'm suffering because of what I did but I'm not going to let that control me or change I'm going to serve God even with this brother Brandon was coming back to Jeffersonville what to preach to make tapes to do conventions to have meetings to make these tapes amen that we are listening to now he pushed beyond that thing and didn't let it control him and didn't let it stop him but he said that's my fault I have to deal with that but I'm moving on in the program of God and I don't think he ever quit praying or hoping that God would take that away so we don't put it under tribute we don't just roll over and say that's the way it is we say that's my fault but I'm moving on God please help me amen amen when I begin to look at the prophet's life I begin to realize I begin to appreciate so much that God gave us a prophet in this generation and recorded his life yeah and then that Prophet was so humble and honest he would just tell us everything that happens the way he felt and the mistakes he made and the things he got right and the things he got wrong and all the things God did I'm so thankful because if all we got was the message in a in a book form and it came down and that message would begin to tell us that you're the Bride of Jesus Christ that God is calling you to a union with him now he's going to be manifest in Bride form in you and the fullness of the life has come back the fullness of the power he's the same yesterday today and forever and all the signs that were in Christ and all that he did should be manifest in the bride amen if that's all we had amen and we didn't have a life to look at we would be a terribly disappointed confused people because we would think that all those promises he made and all those truths would mean that we were bulletproof and had no problems and spoke the word and everything just just erased from our lives and we eradicated from sickness and family trouble and personal issues and mistakes and failures and all the consequences that come from them we would think to be this word we have to have a life that looks like this but brother Ram didn't just preach the message he demonstrated the message he lived the message he was the first part of that word to come to harvest maturity it came in him it was Christ in him manifesting the son of man Ministry and what did we have we had a prophet of God where God was working through a vessel doing some of the greatest Miracles that have ever been done and recorded on the face of the Earth and he was standing gripping a Pulpit so hard cuz he was so sick he was about to fall over and he couldn't get healed but everybody that come by got healed yeah right amen you have a man who had all kinds of complications and trials and difficulty he had campaign managers that would turn their back on him he had them that would steal his magazine and steal his tent he had rejection he had people in his own church who fall away he had all he had people who would rise up and and call him Jesus Christ and start baptizing in his name he had people who would call him a devil and come away he had everything that could go wrong he got sick he got the flu he got swimmy-headed when he come back to Jeffersonville he had a rejection complex that would causing problems he talked about standing in the Gap he he had a problem with his son who went off and got married he had to ad the marriage and then got married wrong and had all this trouble and this yeah right oh I'm so thankful we didn't just have word but we had life amen we had what is it to have a son of God and now has amen Christ working through him has the full revelation of the word manifesting the very things that Christ did did did God manifest himself through that vessel did he do the very works that Christ did did he get sick did he throw up did he have a headache did he have a thorn in his flesh did he make a mistake did he suffer the rest of his life for a mistake so if God if that's what it's like to be a Son of God then I can be a Son of God too I can be a Son of God I can have a problem in my home I can have a thorn in my flesh I can be still be suffering from a mistake I made 20 years ago and not able to erase it from my life but I can still be a Son of God Amen I I can be sick and still believe amen right I can be weak and still believe I can be afflicted and still believe I can be a rejected and believe amen I'm so thank I I I'm so thankful that God has given us 1200 tapes I just think we'd be so confused without it but now we can live what he's called us to live without misunderstanding what it's supposed to look like let's look at uh 2 Corinthians we're going to come back to judges but let's just look quick at 2 Corinthians chapter 12 2 Corinthians chapter 12 in verse 7 2 Corinthians 12: 7 and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the Revelation there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure this is the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul who was the first church age messenger he was the the he had the gospel of grace he he he set the doctrine of grace in order he he wrote most of the New Testament he had manifestations in his life he was called to a very high position he was an apostle called to the Lord he met him as the pillar of fire and the form he returned to after his death and resurrection and the Apostle Paul raised the dead open blind eyes had all manner of manifestation in his life and had the the the word he knew the word but God would see fit to leave an enemy in his life a messenger of Satan to Buffet him a thorn in the flesh to trouble him and why would God leave an enemy in his life and we have no we have no uh record in the Bible that this was any fault of the Apostle Paul we don't know that he did anything to deserve this it was just something that God chose to allow and what would God why would God choose to allow it because of the abundance of the Revelation so that he wouldn't be puffed up God knew that for Paul it was dangerous for him it was dangerous for him to have all this abundance of Revelation in this position God called him men without something to balance it out because it could it could actually this abundance of Revelation could actually work something negative in The Human Side of Paul and Paul could find himself straight away so God did something in his love for Paul that would keep Paul in the straight and arrow praise be to God so Paul sought the Lord three times that this would be delivered but when God told him no this is th my grace is sufficient for thee I've given this to thee then he says now I'll glory in my infirmities because I know that this is God working something wonderful in my life now I'm not going to be sad about it I'm not going to be depressed I'm not going to quit the ministry yeah right I'm going to keep pressing forward because God's done this to keep me right so that I can Minister praise be to God things are not what we think amen if that could be the Apostle Paul what about you and I yeah amen and I don't know that it was like I said I don't know that it was Paul's fault we have no reason to believe that it was something Paul did wrong but in fact it was something that was going right in his life that he had an abundance of Revelation say thank you God brother brandham starts to talk about his life here in uniting times and signs in 1963 and he says he said what's this tension if I could have been born without this tension well if I wouldn't have had had this tension I wouldn't have been what I am I wouldn't have been a Christian perhaps it was this tension that drove me to Jesus Christ see so it's been a blessed blessing thing to me that's so hard to say because this this tension that he had didn't do him any favors in the natural it it really plagued his life it troubled him from the time he was a little boy he would get nervous and get upset and have all these things in his life amen but he says it's this tension that drove me to Jesus Christ so it's been a blessing blessing thing to me but listen what he goes on to say so then as Paul said as though when he had tension or something or another he had consulted the Lord to take it away from him three times and the Lord said uh Saul uh my grace is sufficient he said then I will glory in my infirmities when I am weak I am strong as long as it's to the will of God all right now I consulted him one time when it used to bother me so bad it scared me and he told me about eight or 10 years ago he said it'll never scare you again and it never has did it no sir don't worry about it I just feel it but I know it's there but I just go on because it don't scare me no more so thankful for that am now he could have said it won't be no more just as well as that it won't scare you no more so it it it's his will that it happen so I just embrace it and say thank you Lord I'll walk that way yeah this is something that this is not something that was a light Affliction for the prophet of God but it was serious and it caused him serious bouts uh uh serious bouts of trouble health issues tension and trouble but then he realized when God told him he won't scare you no more he realized God could have just as easily said it won't be no more so they were serving some purpose now brother B starts to say well it's this tension that made me what I am it's this tension that made me a Christian maybe I wouldn't be amen maybe it's this tension that drove me to Jesus Christ so praise God whatever God allows is for good he didn't listen he didn't let it stop his forward progress he just recognized it's there and God permitted it it don't scare me I feel it coming but I'm moving on I'm serving God's purpose I'm serving God and we know that the prophet of God he never just let that thing control his life and he never just gave in to it when he couldn't defeated it troubled him amen God would have to raise him back up and give him strength to go back at it but we know on the wings of a snow white dove God delivered him from that he fought all his life against it he resisted it and he recognized that it's serving some purpose in my life so I'll just move on forward with it and he told me it won't scare me praise God I'm thankful for that but it's serving a purpose and I'm moving on but he never stopped trusting God to heal him amen he never stopped believing God would and God honored his faith in the end of his life the last 30 days of his life or something like that God he he come and preach on the wings of a snow white dove so his healing was before it have been more than 30 days but like the last two months of his life amen God freed him from that and he said I'm healed amen that's why we said last time I want to resist whatever it is that's hindering me I want to resist it until my my last final breath amen if I'm delivered 5 minutes before I die then so be it I just don't want to give in to it I don't want it to let it control me I don't want to stop my purpose because of whatever it is that's laying there whether it's my fault or permitted by God or whatever I just want to keep pressing on amen he says brother B says Christ is revealed in his own word in this message Christ is revealed in his own word he says I was just talking to a young Minister and his wife in the room just a few moments ago and both of them are nervous just like the rest of the world rest of the human beings on Earth I said remember Satan's got a Punch coming at you don't care who you are he's got a right for that one punch which which had you rather it be that punch be blind or be arthritic sitting in a chair be nervous he's got somewhere he can punch you he's got the right to that open place now that's the spot you got to keep covered all the time not just say well my mom was like that I'm like that no you got to keep that covered all the time amen you know I I just Envision what what it should have been maybe in Canaan and I this is just brother Chad because I could be a million miles from right but as a reflect on the the the Canaanites they couldn't drive out the inhabitants that they couldn't drive out in these pockets in these sectors and they would try and they would fail but then they said you know what this is too hard I I can't face this thing anymore it's it's difficult let's just make an agreement you stay I'll stay and we'll just forget about it but they weren't supposed to do that they were supposed to fight against it and maybe they couldn't move them this time and and maybe there's a break maybe there's a law in the fighting and maybe they raise up again and there's another battle maybe they come down off the mountain to to steal their weed or to plague them or and they fight back against it again maybe they can't have Victory but they just drive it back a little bit and then they know it's going to come again cuz it's not gone they keep plowing their land they keep tilling their land they don't make a league they're not they're not I'm not happy about that thing up there it's got to go God told us to possess the land that's our land that thing's got to go maybe they try again and fail maybe the Canaanite comes down off the hill after them and they drive them back but they failed to fully eradicate them amen but the the issue is they should never have stopped trying and they should have never have stopped doing what God called them to do amen and I can imagine this is just me as my imagination but I could imagine the Canaanites amassing the army that little pocket that been there they've been quiet for a while but now they're going to come down I could just imagine if Israel could have taken this attitude if they could have said oh the that those up on the hill there those from megiddo those from the Rocky place they're coming back down again with their iron chariots maybe this will be the time God delivers them into our hand maybe this will be the last fight maybe this will be the last time we Face see that's the right attitude friends maybe this time this will be the last time they go maybe this is the last time I have to deal with this amen not oh I just I can't ever overcome that I just please go away here take my crops and go back we got a league no sir amen you may have dealt with something for years and years you may have a health issue or you may have some issue in your life or a family issue or a trouble or complex and it comes back from time to time amen you just pick up your sword of the word and believe maybe this is the time God will deliver them into my hand maybe this is my last battle amen it may not be but why take the other attitude is I hope that goes away fast so I don't have to deal with this again God promised he would drive them out if he lets them to remain there's a purpose behind it but I'm not giving into it I'm not I'm not being overcome by it I'm not stopping I'm not going to stop doing what he told me to do maybe this is the last battle maybe you've got to fight something in your life again maybe this is the last battle you know the difference in Attitude changes so much yeah amen when you say oh no this again we're never going to get over this oh God I just hope it goes goes away fast listen that's a defeated attitude from the very beginning but oh if we could take the attitude of here it comes again maybe this is the time amen maybe God will give me Victory this time and I'm going to take the promise of God I'm going to take the word of God and I'm going to strike that thing as hard as I possibly can and if God will help me we'll drive it out and you may have that battle again and again and again but fight it with the good fight of Faith friends amen amen let's go back to the Book of Judges Judges chapter 2 I want to continue on in the story so they they failed and they put them under league and that was the problem was putting them under League not failing I I hope that you understand this friends when you resist the devil amen and you take the word and you believe the word and you don't get Deliverance right away and it doesn't look like it's working amen God's not God's not upset at you because it didn't work because you can't do anything without him anyways amen failing is not the problem it's when we stop trying that's the problem when we stop believing when we stop pushing when we stop fighting that's the problem when we put it under tribute that's why he was angry and when they put him under tribute he says now I'll not drive them out but they'll remain and be thorns in your flesh and then we go a little further in Judges chapter 2 and look what he says now Judges chapter 2 verse 20 and the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel and he said because that this people hath transgressed my Covenant which I commanded their fathers and have not hearkened into my voice I also will not henceforth drive out any from from before them of the Nations which Joshua left when he died that that through them I may prove Israel whether they will keep my way of the Lord to walk therein as their fathers did or not therefore the Lord left those Nations without driving them out hastily neither delivering he them into the hand of Joshua he left them but he left them for a purpose he left them so that he could prove Israel and then if you look at that last verse again he said therefore the Lord left those Nations without driving them out hastily oh there's some hope in the word hastily that doesn't mean he'll never drive them out he just not going to drive them out hastily because now he's going to use them to prove Israel now there's a purpose in them staying there and when they fulfilled their purpose they'll be driven out amen and we know under the ministry of Solomon they were they were driven out under the son of David Ministry amen he never said it was going to be there forever he said now I'm not going to drive him out I'm not going to drive them out hastily oh praise God if you give a child of God one Speck of Hope and Faith he's going to hold on to that amen he's going to say did you read the word hastily everybody else will say he said he's not going to drive them out he won't drive them out he won't drive them out but you get somebody with faith planted down in their soul they'll look at a little word called hastily and said hey praise God he said hastily that's the difference between a Believer and an unbeliever an unbeliever will look for the to disbelieve the believer will look for the excuse to believe they'll look for the fraction the word they'll look for an exclamation point they'll look for a comma in a certain spot they're looking for a reason to trust God they're looking for a reason to believe the unbeliever is looking for a reason not to believe and God gives them plenty of reasons then you start adding up words and quotes and scriptures and he says he says don't remove won't move allow to remain he said that four times in the Book of Judges but the believer says but he said hastily once and all I need is once amen you have four times it will not remove I have one time of hastily and I believe he's going to remove this enemy [Applause] someday praise be to God but he said he'll leave them there to prove is real this word prove is the same one in the New Testament as the Old Testament it means to test to try to prove to tempt to essay to put to the proof test God why what's God looking for he's looking for Faith he's looking for somebody to believe his word and he left listen what was what was left in the land amen that he wouldn't drive out the inhabitants of the land that were embedded there that they couldn't drive out amen he would not drive them out now because now he's going to use their mistake to prove them amen see even that statement you can take a positive or A negative depends on whether you have faith or not because you can say oh they left their mistake and God's going to God's going to prove every generation now and everybody's going to fail wait a second that's not why he left them there he left them there to prove that there's still Believers here amen even under this enemy even if I leave them there and they afflict them again and again and again I'm proving that I still got true Israelites in the land there's still somebody that will fight back resist press forward believe me and stay with my word amen that's the way it does when when these inhabitants of the land absolutely corrupted the land in the Days of Elijah Under The Jezebel Ahab Ministry amen they completely had taken over they were serving all the neighboring gods they had set up temples to balum they had all this stuff that was going on Amen and and Elijah was standing against that regardless of what was going on but he got discouraged cuz he felt like he was the only one and God said I've got 7,000 that have not bail bowed the need to bail what was that he proved the 7,000 he may have proved the millions didn't believe him amen but the point of the story was he proved there was 7,000 in the face of ad dter in the face of Canaanite hittite Idol idolatry there was still 7,000 that didn't bow the knee you say oh I got troubles I got problems I got things that happen in my life over and over let it prove that you're still a Believer Amen Let It prove that you believe his word you believe his promise and you're not backing down on the promise he gave you let him prove you by the result of your own mistake praise God Amen praise God you say how can God do God turns every negative into a positive now look at look at Judges chapter 3 now the story keeps unfolding it gets beautiful friends Judges chapter 3 verse 1 says now these are the Nations which the Lord left to prove Israel by them even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan only that the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach them War at the least such as before knew nothing thereof namely the five Lords of the Philistines uh and all the Canaanites and the sidonians and the hivites and they dwelt in the Mount Lebanon from Mount B Herman into the entering in of HTH and they were to prove Israel by them to know whether they would hearken unto the Commandments of the Lord which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses I I think the most uh uh uh exciting part of all of this is verse one he says now these are the Nations which the Lord left to prove Israel by them even as many of Israel had not known all the wars of Canaan so he knew there was going to be another generation that didn't remember the conquest of Canaan yeah and when God had stoned the enemies when they came out of gilgal when God had driven them out and there was going to be Generations that come that didn't know he says verse two and only that the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach them War at the least such as before knew nothing thereof God says this mistake you make this failure to drive them out now I'll not drive them out but I'm going to use them to prove you whether you'll listen to the words of my words are not and I'm going to use these nations to teach your children War so that they won't forget how to fight what would happen if under brother brenham's Ministry he had eradicated all sickness and all trouble and he preached the word and the word drove out every obstacle we would ever ever faces Christians and now we come up here 60 years later you know what we would be we would be soft jellyfish with nothing to prove us and nothing to test us and no faith we'd have absolutely no faith because everything was removed from us but God says you've made the mistake and what what the devil meant for evil I will intend it for good this will be the very thing that proves that you're a Believer it'll test you prove you and keep driving you back to my word and it'll be the very thing that teaches the generations to come how to fight the good fight of faith and not be overcome by Canaanites and Hittites and jebusites amen when this message came God brought us freedom he delivered us from denominations he delivered us from wrong ideas he set us absolutely free and brought us into the inheritance the promise of his word but guess what there's still embedded inhabitants there's still troubles in there we still have sickness we still have complex we still have family issu we still have all kinds of trouble why is it still there oh I'm so thankful that it's still still there so that I didn't forget how to fight that I didn't forget how to take the sword of the word and drive it to the heart of the enemy God does not want his bride in the end time to be a soft jellyfish that doesn't know how to stand In the Heat of battle and to take a sword of the word and stand upon the word regardless of what else is going on Amen the devil meant it for evil but God's going to use it for good this is what brother Benham says in the message does God change his mind says so we really believe that God never changes his mind about what he said he always keeps it true but he has a permissive will now there where the trouble lays we try to work on God's permissive will and he will permit it but also if we take permissive will though it's not right he will make his permissive will to work out together to glorify his perfect will it's what he did in Israel that's what he did for them when they failed he took the permissive will where they had they were to drive out the inhabitants and they failed and put them under tribute and he turned it to his perfect will here's what brother Bram says further there is nothing will go wrong with God hallelujah hallelujah can you include yourself in that statement even your mistakes even your failures even your genetic things you're dealing with from Grandma Grandpa there's nothing that will go wrong with God he knows just where the clock is a ticking at tonight there is nothing wrong every lick is hitting just exactly the way it should be everything we think it's wrong but he knows it's right it's supposed to be like this oh my goodness so you look back in the Book of Judges you say is it right or wrong you say what's wrong but it's right right it's wrong what they did was wrong they are wrong they repent they own up to it and they claim the responsibility for it but for God he said this is perfect I can use this for what I want to use it for it's not going to stop God's purpose it's not going to change his perfect will it's not going to change anything they were still God's promised people and God promised them the land and God was giving them the land listen you know what helps us so much in this message is that God revealed to us who really are and he took the spiritual Amnesia took the cloudiness out of our eyesight and we could realize that I came from God I'm going back to God if I'm the elected of God I was chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world my name was placed on that book an indelible ink of the blood of Jesus Christ never to be erased and so my mistakes won't change that my failure won't change that my not my inability to drive out the Canaanites won't change that and that's the Revelation we've got to have to stand in this because listen we make mistakes we're suffering from our mistakes we've got problems in family we got problems in life we got handicaps we got all kinds of stuff that we did to ourselves and if we didn't have the foundation of pre faith and predestination we would be tossed all over the place but there's got to be something that causes us to stand our ground and say no I'm not going anywhere I'm believing this word regardless of what happens and that's what this message came to do to us is to positionally place us as his children amen God through a promise he promised Israel he positionally placed them as His nation in the land they didn't have to leave they could have stayed right there and say yes there's Canaanites there yes I failed but I'm not giving into to that because I know who I am I am a child of God position he placed right here you know because of their failure every year the Philistines would come come down at the time of the judges the Philistines would come down and would ransack their barns take their wheat take their barley and Destroy them why because they made a league with them and left them there and then they grew stronger and overpowered them because they grew strong they put them under tribute right that's a false perception of strength yeah amen we are never strong enough to put sin under tribute amen or unbelief or compromise that's right so now these Philistines are coming down to ransack their farms and take their land take their crops but there was a little man named shamgar yeah and what did shamgar remember brother B dramatized we got two little scriptures in the Bible that mention shamgar but we had a prophet of God and God could lead by vision and he began to tell us that shamgar began to look around and he heard the the the the Thousand Phil phines marching down the road in armor and Spears and all the things that they had and he looked over the shabby wife and his hungry kids and he had nothing but he had what he had was what defeated the enemy and what he had was a revelation of who he was he was a Seed of Abraham he was under the circumcision seal and he was in the land that God had given him and so no matter how many times he had had his crops raided I doubt that was the first time the Philistines came because he said year after brother man said year after year they were coming and taking away and now he couldn't buy a dress for his wife and his kids were hungry and ragged and his whole Farm was dilapidated because they' been doing year after year year after year year after year but something rose up inside of him that said not this year and he took what was in his hand just the farmer's Ox goat and he took it and he and he beat them down with an ox goat I I I just would like to say I don't believe he beat them down with an ox goat I believe he beat them down in faith in who he was and in the promise of God he just happened to have an ox goat in his hand David didn't kill Goliath by a stone he killed Goliath by faith in who he was God just used a sling and a stone to accomplish the purpose amen we've got to come back to a revelation you know what I failed I've messed up I own it these things I'm suffering with are my fault not anybody else I'm not blaming anybody else it's me it's not God's fault it's my fault when brother Bram come over the knobs and got swimy head and and got sick he wasn't saying this is God's fault he said this is my fault yeah and that's all true but that doesn't change who we are that doesn't change the promise that doesn't change the way God thinks about us that doesn't change anything in the word if we can only catch the inspiration of the word and take what God's given us and fight back against those things there come a time though he had been robbed many times there came a time where he was robbed for the last time what overcame Faith amen I don't even know if I finished this quote yeah I'll read this last sends again because there's one more part he says there's nothing will go wrong with God he knows just where the clock is tick at tonight there is nothing wrong every lick is hitting just exactly the way it should be everything we think it's wrong has anybody confessed that they many times thought it was wrong it looks wrong it feels wrong we think it's wrong but there's nothing wrong because the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord we think it's wrong but he knows it's right it's supposed to be like this now listen that statement like at the beginning God just permitted sin to come that wasn't his perfect will he's talking about the Fall In the Garden of Eden all the way back in Eden that was permissive will not perfect will but there's no way the per permissive will cannot work right to glorify his perfect will and now we were all born by sex desire we all came wrong not according to the original way but we all came right because there's a purpose that God had in it all and God's accomplishing his great Plan of Redemption was it wrong yes did they suffer for the wrong yes are we still suffering for their wrong yes but is it working something perfect in our lives yes is it accomplishing God's purpose yes is it good for us yes is it bringing us into a greater revelation of who God is yes is it giving us more love for our savior and Redeemer yes it looks wrong but nothing's wrong with god brother B tells us the story of Jonah everything in Jonah looked wrong he preaches in a message a man running from the presence of the Lord he said remember where Jonah went God was in the boat God was in the storm God was in the fish he went on being right along with Jonah until his perfect will was done what a statement God tells Jonah to go to Nineveh Jonah Jonah does not want to go to Nineveh and we know he hates the ninevites he hates the Gentiles because after he preached the message they repented he went up and sat on the hill and watched over Waiting for God to destroy and when God didn't he got angry and bitter because God didn't destroy them God hate he Jonah hated those people right he didn't want to go there and preach and he didn't want them to be saved he said isn't this what I told you in the beginning that they would repent you would spare their lives and he was mad about it so he doesn't want to go to Nineveh so he goes to tarus so brother man's preaching a man running from the presence of the Lord he thinks he's running away from what God wants him to do he's moving away from the commission he's moving away from the calling he doesn't want to do it and listen brother Bram said God was in the boat What boat The Runaway boat yeah he was in the storm what storm the judging storm he was in the fish what fish the destroying fish he went right along being with Jonah until his perfect will was done that's right if he's ever after you you might Dodge over here and Dodge over there but you'll be miserable till you come back and do the thing you started out for him to do it the first place don't go run from the presence of God face up to him you believe it's the truth then if it's the truth it's worth living for dying for anything else and if he's ever Vindicated to you that it is the truth then we can't run from it nowhere he'll be right there just the same where will he be he'll be in the boat he'll be in the the storm he'll be in the fish listen and and don't think that that Jonah disobeyed God and he got off scott free that never happens because the storm the fish the seaweed the guts the bottom of the sea wasn't a reward it wasn't pleasant it didn't feel good it wasn't a happy place to be the feelings the emotions the Fright the ter eror the Sten the listen we don't get away with anything but nothing will stop God's purpose in our life and everything will work together for good but we don't get away with a thing so you can't look at Jonah and say oh that was such a wonderful Story how that worked out he said wonderful you should have been in the fish's belly it didn't feel so wonderful to me man we see that in people's lives go through TR tragedy and all kinds of heartache and and and things happen in families and things happen in their own lives and things happen because of our own mistakes and tragedy strikes and somehow God works it all out and in the end there's a story of redemption and you're restored and there's a restoration somebody says oh you were so lucky you were so blessed God so blessed you and you realize yes God blessed me beyond what I deserve but you have no idea what I suffered to get here that was my fault that was my doing but but I suffered friends no nobody just skates through in the message the sign of this time he he's still talking about Jonah he says and in Nineveh I am told that the whale was the sea God because he's the master of the sea he can swallow up anything and about noon time there come their God up out of the sea just open up his mouth and the prophet walks right out onto the bank no wonder they believe see they certainly they believe because the prophet that was given the message came out of their God's mouth repent or this city will perish he wasn't out of the will of the Lord he was doing just God makes everything work together for good to them that love God that's right and we're called according to his purpose was he wrong yes did it stop God's will no did God's will come through the wrong path yes listen I'm not going to be able to figure that out and you're not going to be able to figure it out but it's the truth amen there's a story that takes place in the Book of Judges Judges chapter 20 I was going to turn and read there but I don't want to take the time you can go back and read it but you're familiar most of you with the story where the levite was traveling with a concubine and he came to a city of Benjamin and in the city of Benjamin they took his concubine and abused her terribly until she died then he divided her into 12 parts and sent to the or and sent to the tribes of Israel and to declare what had been done in Benjamin and all the tribes of Israel come together and they come together and they said there has to be a judgment this thing cannot remain in Israel we can't let this stay so they decide that they're all going to go and fight and Destroy Benjamin and it's it's interesting when you read through the story and like I said I'm not going to take the time to go through it but go back and read Judges chapter 20 sometime and they asked the Lord they inquired of the Lord they said Lord who should go up first among us to battle and the Lord said Judah shall go first so they've got God's instruction for the battle they're going to go for righteous reasons they're going to go to clean keep Israel clean and clean out this iniquity from Israel and God even tells them who will go first to battle you know if that ever happens to us we'd be like oh we got the battle plan we know who goes first Victory is assured the scripture said they went to fight against Benjamin and Benjamin prevailed over them they turned their backs again and Benjamin hewed to the ground 25,000 of the nation of Israel they came back they come back to Camp they set the battle in Array they went and wept before the Lord and said Lord amen what basically you're saying Lord what's wrong what's wrong they said God should we go up again tomorrow or should we stop and God says go again y Oh Praise God we heard from the Lord we got Victory coming tomorrow you know the story they go out to battle the next day the same exact thing happens the second day is the first day now the second day amen Benjamin fights against them and and they turn their back to Benjamin and Benjamin Hues to the ground 18,000 25,000 the first day 18,000 the second day they're they're losing by droves I mean a massive casualty count yeah they come back to the next time to the Lord they inquired of the Lord before the yman Thum and they said God Amen what shall we go or shall we not go I mean you would ask the same question I would ask the same question we would all be saying what's wrong what's not working something's wrong somewhere but God says go up then he says for tomorrow I'll deliver them under your hand that phrase changes everything yeah before he just says send Judah first okay we send Judah first just do what he says yeah and don't add to it he never promised them a victory he just told him who should go first so they should have done exactly what he said come back the next day oh God what should we do he said go up he didn't say they'd win he just said go up they're obeying the Lord and walking in his Commandments doing what the God told him to do and yet they're losing seemingly it's not working but then the third time he says go up for tomorrow I'll deliver them into your hands and they went up the third time and it's interesting the way it reads in the Book of Judges when you read it they go up the third day and in the third day amen they they decide that they're going to have some people waiting to Ambush the city they're going to try to draw the Benjamin uh The Tribe of Benjamin away from the city and they send just a small army in front of Benjamin and and then when Benjamin comes out they turn and run and this is what Benjamin says says look they run before us as before as before and as they went chasing after them the layers and weight the ambushers they went into the City and began burning the city then they turned back and they they turned together and they destroyed almost all of Benjamin all but 600 men yeah they completely wiped out you say what was wrong before who sinned before what did they get wrong in the instruction before nothing they did what God said they lost they did what God said they lost just because you do what God says doesn't mean you're going to get instant results doesn't mean amen that you're going to turn around overnight amen but what he was doing was drawing the enemy to a false sense of security we got 25,000 the first day 18,000 now look they're running away from us yeah just like before they didn't leave anybody to defend the city they all come spilling out God had trained them to fall into his trap yeah right right amen nothing's wrong everything's right maybe God's training the devil to fall into his trap for you amen don't doubt the word don't doubt God Amen if you do what God says and you don't get the results you expect just expect different results tomorrow we don't know why God's doing what he's doing but God is doing something in our lives we can come up with all kinds of analysis and this and that and but forget it just do what he said and believe him and trust in him amen and ask him should we do it yes believe the word always believe the word stand on the promise always stand on the promise and at some point God's going to deliver them into their hands amen there are those stories like that where it seems like everything's going wrong and you wouldn't you wouldn't criticize anybody for doubting you wouldn't criticize them for saying maybe we shouldn't do it again I know God said go up but he said go up before right and now 18,000 of our friends are dead yeah I know you said the scripture says this but we tried that before and it didn't work for my grandma and it didn't work for my mom and it didn't work Hey listen I don't care how many times God doesn't make it work out for different circumstances he's got a reason behind all of it but if God said it I'm going to stand with it and believe it and believe it to come to pass in my life brother says in the message Jehovah Gyra he says he was going to give his Abraham a double test he said Abraham take thy son thine only son and take him to a certain Mountain where I'm going to show you and there sacrifice him now what if Abraham would have took the second thought how am I going to be a father of Nations when here I I am this old and you're asking me to kill and destroy the only evidence that I have that you'll keep your word and make me a father of Nations that's reasonings God had promised him his son he waited 25 years for the son now he hears 13 years later and God tells him to go kill his son and then look what brother M says how God loves to test his people God loves to test his people every child that comes to God must be tested child trained no exceptions everyone and maybe tonight that you're sick just to have a little child training just a little testing don't be discouraged God's on the throne he knows all things if we're truly born of the spirit of God everything's working together for our good he's going to make everything right he promised he would he swore he would and he's got to keep his word he's kept it now for thousands of years to every believer amen oh brother God loves to test his people you got a little sickness you got something going on just a little child training thank God thank God for the child training thank God that he's he he's not let us forget how to fight yeah you say I got so much trouble brother Chad it's one problem after another well praise God he wants you to be a warrior amen praise the Lord amen he knows you can have Victory he knows that you can fight he knows you believe the word but it's one after another and it's Relentless it's coming one after another so is God not on the throne does he not know what he's doing does he not love to prove his children does he know what's in you better than you know what's in you does he think that you can handle it yes cuz he's bringing one after another Ed just been beat down so many trials one after another after another I can't ever well praise the Lord a little child training coming because he wants you to be a warrior I said this before and I'll say it again it sounds so harsh friends it sounds terrible but I'm just going to say it when those things happen in our life God is not feeling sorry for us because he knows what he's accomplishing in our life it's something Wonder F he's want to give us a victory he wants to prove himself to us he wants to show how much he loves us there's something God's accomplishing in our life and because God knows the future he's not feeling sorry for us right like if you ask your child to go out and pick up all the sticks in the yard and you know in your heart if he works hard and he does a good job you got an ice cream cone waiting for him yeah and he's out there sweating and picking up sticks you don't feel sorry for him because there's a prize you're excited you can't wait for him when he gets that last one in the fire pit you know that he's going to get rewarded you're nether going oh poor boy I'm so sorry I shouldn't have asked him to pick up sticks you know what's you know what's in store Hey listen God is a good father and he knows what's in store and he knows what he's doing in our lives so if God's not feeling sorry for me why am I feeling sorry for me self-pity is a disease it's handicapping it's blinding and it destroys us right Romans 8:28 says and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose by this message we believe that we fit into this category that we are the called according to his purpose that means all things I've said this many times but I'll say it again does anybody know the definition of all it's different than some and it's different than most it's all all things work together for good brother B goes on to say but if the people won't walk in his perfect will he does have a permissive will he'll let you walk in notice he permits it all right but he will make it work out for his glory and his perfect will some of us suffer like Israel did the things they did in the permissive will of God and they suffered for the decisions they made we suffer for the decisions we made but that suffering will work for the glory of his perfect will it will I'd like to look back at the prophet's life remember I started by sharing my appreciation for God giving us an example of a Son of God showing what a Son of God with the restored truth with faith with God working through him should look like and it helps me so much when we come into difficult times and things of we don't understand or can't comprehend just to see how God trained and raised and used that Son of God in the message Shalom from 1964 the prophet says many people ask why they ask sometimes they ask me why why must these things happen what why why did this happen to me why did I start out and this happened and I had this trouble here and this upset me here and I lost this here sometimes I've asked why why when I was just a young Minister first started out did God take my wife right out from under me take my baby right from beneath me right beneath my heart why did he do that I don't know I do now he says I didn't know I do now here comes the prophet of God and the if you step back to the place he was when he was a young man in his early 20s trying to serve God starting a church preaching the gospel and right in that early stage of his life he failed to go out when God called him and he listened to his mother-in-law and one of the consequences for that action is he lost his wife and he lost his baby and even hope when she come back he went and he found her she was laying there she had just slipped away and he called her back and she asked why did you call me back Bill she begins to describe to him the other side and she says you know where we made our mistake don't you we should have never listened to Mama this brother listen he failed he went into the permissive will of God but did it work out to the glory of God's perfect will did we see it we witnessed it did it hurt yes did it affect him the rest of his life if you don't think so go listen to life story from 1951 and again in 1959 and he's weeping so hard at the end he can't finish his life story don't think that that didn't cost him but it all worked together for good and brother B said I didn't know I didn't understand why he let that happen I didn't know I do now I just held my hand in his and kept trusting amen he knows every Junction he knows the Rhythm when it must take place he knows what it takes to mold you he knows what kind of material he's going to use see how wonderful it is to have a prophet who will come to one of the most horrific things in his life to one of the most troubling things that have ever happened to him to lose in this short period of time his young wife and his young baby so much so that he tried to commit suicide twice and he was angry cuz God wouldn't let him die he was that miserable friends this wasn't this isn't just a story this is a man who has to live through these things and he knows it was his mistake he gets caught in the flood with his little boat and he's heading for the falls and he can't get his engine started amen and you know what he's saying he realizes while he's floating towards the Falls till destruction amen trying to crank that motor he starts to repent and said God I'm sorry I failed I should have never listened to my mother-in-law I should have went out when you called me and he repented and he made it right and after he repented and recognized his failure he pulled that engine and it took off and got to safety but in the same flood in the same storm in the same period of time he lost his wife and he lost his baby why why do these things have to happen here he comes at the end of his life this is 1964 he comes he's 55 years old at this time and he says he knows every Junction why did why did he do that I didn't know I do now I just held my hand in his and trusted but look what he says next he knows what it takes to mold you he knows what kind of material he's going to use see the backside of the desert sometimes where God molds righteous men into sages and Prophets see that's where men are beat out men are beat out in the word when they get all kind of creed and stuff in them let them come to the word and God beats it right out of them molds it right into this into the great sympathy of his word and then they see the word moving on God knows when the rhythm of it has got to change he knows how the Rhythm goes I don't know how it goes but he knows he knows how it goes I don't but I look at it here and I say well it's just coming many are the afflictions of the righteous but God deliver them out of them all God has moved through history with the rhythm of the promise of the word in each age in some in the same Rhythm making his word why why did it have to go that way why did he have to make that mistake why did he have to listen to his mother-in-law why and I don't know that I can answer all the reasons why or all the things that God accomplished with that but one thing for no brother Ben had to repent of and he said it was wrong but that wrong worked together for right because we had a man who was molded by those those things and he was changed by those things that he suffered and then God got a man in his hand that would stick with his word he got a man would go regardless of what anybody said would preach what he was told regardless of what anybody said about it because he knew what it was like to listen to other voices and not listen to the voice of God he knew so deeply he knew he felt it to the core of his soul he knew how deeply that hurt Amen to disobey God and now he wasn't going to do it again and as if that wasn't enough every time he come over the knobs and come back into Jeffersonville he got sick again just to remind him you must follow the word of the Lord it looks like it's all wrong but it's not all wrong it looks like it it's just pain for no reason but it's not pain for no reason God is working all things together for good and I hate that the prophet suffered that personally as a human being I hate when I think about the way he describes his little daughter and the suffering and it just tears into pieces I can't listen to his life life story without crying but I'm so thankful God molded him where would we be if God didn't work in his life if God didn't prove him if God didn't test him if God didn't build his faith if God never corrected him where would you and I be and where would others be if God never proved us and corrected us and molded us and made us into what he wants us to be the molding isn't always easy but the molding is necessary and God will take everything that's in our life to mold us into the character that he wants us to have even our mistakes even when we went to permissive will and caused oursel heaps of pain God will use that pain to mold us not just for us but for somebody else I can't I'm I hurt for the prophet when I hear him hurt but I can't help but thank God that God loved me enough that he would do something like that sometimes we got to fly On Eagle's Wings and get a little higher so that we can put things in perspective because when we're looking at incident by incident and Circumstance by circumstance it seems overwhelming and impossible and all wrong and everything's wrong amen but you got to fly a little higher up to where God is and see with God's eyes and say there isn't anything wrong all of these wrongs are going to work together for right and nothing's going to do nothing is going to stop God's will in fact everything would work together to glor to bring glory to his perfect will Ecclesiastes can you turn to with me to Ecclesiastes we're just just about done we're going to wrap up right here let's turn to Ecclesiastes it's uh Proverbs uh I mean Psalms Proverbs Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes chapter 7 verse one Ecclesiastes 7:1 a good name is better than precious ointment and the day of death than the day of one's birth it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting for that is the end of all men and the living will lay it to his heart sorrow is better than laughter for by the sadness of the countenance The Heart Is Made better the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of Mirth it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than for a man to hear the song of fools for as the crackling of thorns under a pot so is the laughter of the fool this also is Vanity Solomon wrote these words Solomon was the wisest man that ever lived on earth outside Jesus Christ and Solomon is telling us the truth and the truth is it's better to go to the house of mour than to the house of feasting you know what we never voluntarily go to the house of mourning but we'll stand in line to go to the house of Mirth and the house of feasting that's just human nature you can sell tickets and pay people will pay a high price to go to the house of Mirth and the house of feasting because that's what we want and to have laughter and to tell jokes and to laugh and have a good time and feel good amen but he says that laughter is like Thorns crackling under a pot there's no does to it it's gone in the flash how many times have you been in a good time a happy time been to a party or been to somebody's house and amen and then you leave and five minutes later you get bad news and all that laughter just went up like smoke God knows God knows what's best for us God knows what changes us God knows what makes us stop and reflect on what's inside God knows to stop us and make us consider who we are and where we're going and what we're doing and the house of morning is better than the house of Earth you know what nobody stands in line to go to the house of mour you don't sell tickets nobody pays a price he pay great sums of money to go to a ball game to shout and have a good time and accomplish absolutely nothing yeah but nobody will pay money to go to the house of morning which will actually change their life yeah right which will actually make them think deeper we actually make them consider what life is all about and who I am and who God is amen it's the times that crush us are the times that mold us it's the times that absolutely strip us to nothing are the very things that make us who we are not the jovial times and the LA we thank God for those times God had feasting days and God had rejoicing times and there was always good things that happen but you can't you can't grow in the good times you grow actually in the Hard Times Solomon goes on to say sorrow is better than laughter listen just underline in your Bible memorize it in your mind just recognize that that is the truth amen and then you say why is it always one struggle to another and a hardship after another because sorrow is better than laughter because the house of mourning is better than the house of feasting because God knows how to mold Us in the fiery flames of Affliction to make us what he puts something inside of us and that thing that inside of us will not rise up under mirth and under feastings and under marment what he put down inside of us his own character it'll come up under adversity and under Affliction and in difficult times look at the prophet of God look at the first stage of his life and look at how hard his life was look at the rejection look at having an alcoholic father and the rejection from the neighborhood the poverty and all the things that he had to suffer with what was God doing God was doing the best thing he could do for that man to prepare him to carry the word and it looks horrible and we would prevent anybody from going through that but God didn't prevent it God ordained it y That's why I ask people I tell people all the time when when I when I learn what they're going through the struggles in life I'm saying I'm so glad God didn't ask me to pick what to do because I would have you bypass all of of it bypass death in the family bypass rejection bypass comple I would have you bypass every difficult thing that happened in your life cuz I hate to watch you suffer but God didn't bypass it and God knew it what he was doing for us was the best thing that he could do for us is he would cause us to stop and reflect on who he is what his word is where we're going and what it's doing for us because sorrow is better than laughter it produces more than laughter Hard Times build character more than good times look at the character of the United States this is a character brother saying the character of leodan characterless yeah do you know who had character those who were alive during the Great Depression right y true those that went through the wars yeah and knew what it was to sacrifice and be be on ration tickets and not have enough and to be hungry and to have to work hours and hours and hours those are the ones who had cared those are the ones who built this country and we living on the riches that they built and now we have no character in our society because they're living in frivolity and Mart and mirth right how did they get there because there was a generation before that went through sorrow and hardship and difficulty and adversity you know the only thing that could save this America which we know it can't be saved but if God wanted to save it the only thing he could do to save it was absolutely collapse it and crush it and bring hardship so that he could bring character back to the people so that he could save it yeah that's what he did to Israel they got up and one generation come amen the generation that knew Joshua they held to the law they did what they could but another generation came and when that generation died they went back to Mart to mirth and to all the benefits that the generation of them before worked for and then they go into frivolity and Mart and joy and pleasure they lose it all am me God crushes them sends them Army to destroy them or takes them away captive just so he could give them hardship and affliction so they could build character so he could bring them back into his land to start rebuilding it again is it a good plan it's a good plan I say God mold me like I don't I don't like the house of Sorrow I don't I don't think any of us like it which one of us want to go to the house of Sorrow we give you an option House of Mirth House of Sorrow I'm going to the house of Mirth I can hear them laughing but God knows what we need sometimes we even make mistakes we fail we do things wrong sometimes God lets enemies stay in our land because those enemies will help mold us into what he wants us to be it'll teach us to fight it'll prove that we still believe God's using all of these things for something good and I'd like to wrap up an end with this story in brother R's life story from 1951 he he says this he talking about going down into the basement and seeing his baby little Sharon Rose so sick and Afflicted and dying he said and the Flies was in her little baby eyes and I shooted the Flies off of her eyes like that and looked down at her and said Sharon Rose honey you're not going to leave Daddy are you remember his wife is already dead at this point and I looked at her little old fat legs her little crippled hand like this and like that as she was drawing quivering and she was looking at me little old lips quivering I said Sharon are you going to leave Daddy and looked like she was quivering so like that she looked up at me she was suffering so hard till one of those little baby eyes her little eyes was crossed like that look at her suffering so and she was looked like she was trying to she was trying to reach her little hands to me oh it just tore pour my heart out of me I don't know that any of us understands what this feels like but that man was being destroyed crushed and molded just tore my heart out of me Oh I thought oh God from that day and you think nothing good can come from something like that it's just suffering it's just pain it's just it's an Affliction that's impossible to overcome but everything produces something good everything turns for the good listen what he says next and this is the part that just began to I don't know do something to me he said oh God from that day that's the reason crossy children oh I just can't stand to look at them you know God does those things sometimes he has to crush something to get the good out of it isn't that right that's right brother B just talking about the story of his little Afflicted 18-month-old baby so Afflicted She's suffering her hands withered up she's quivering like she's trying to reach out to him like she's trying to look at him and her eyes crossed She's suffering so bad and brother bam relates it to cross-eyed children he says and God does those things that's what he's saying God does those things sometimes he has to crush something to get the good out of it isn't that right in blind Bar M he says there was a little cross-eyed boy was next I've never in my life ever seen God turn a crosseyed child down I guess why because when my baby when I was just a boy I lost my wife and baby you know and the little girl suffered so hard till her eyes crossed and I just passed out almost looking at her and I never could stand to see a child crosseyed lord always answered prayer for that brother brandham had to suffer watching his afflicted baby so severely suffering that her eyes crossed until it nearly it tore his heart out it nearly killed him but you know what it produced It produced in him something of compassion a love and he says I've never in my life seen God turn a crosseyed child down you know what the world was full of cross-eyed children and not all of them got healed but every single one that came to this man was healed why because he was molded in the fiery flames of Affliction and it did something to him and and he couldn't stand to see it and because he couldn't stand stand to see it something in him Greed for that child and something because of what he suffered through it gave him a compassion and a desire to see this child and he labored with that child until God answered his prayer of faith and God healed every single one of them amen you know what brother brandham had to suffer with a cross-eyed child but you know how many M and daddies were glad that that suffering produced something God had to crush something to get something good out of him how many hundreds maybe thousands of severely cross-eyed children remember Dawson Riley testimony he went to a meeting when he was just a boy with his parents and he said it was a little girl was sitting in front of him and she turned around to look at him he said her eyes were severely crossy turned in and up severely and he said he felt so bad for her cuz he himself was just a little boy he said her number got called she went into prayer line she went through the prayer line and she come back and when she come back and sat down in front of him she turned around and said her eyes were pretty and normal and straight you know how many blessings have hit parents how many blessings have hit kids how many people have been touched and blessed why because God would crush one man for the benefit of many and that was just one aspect of that crushing that blessed many how many other things came out of those times of hardship for the prophet how many other things that benefit and bless us where he learned to obey he learned to suffer he learned to obey God I say praise God if God can do it for a prophet he can do it for you and I if God can crush us to bring something out of us maybe what he's bringing out of us isn't even for us cuz brother brandom could never pray for his little girl's eyes again but he could pray for every other little child with cross eyes right maybe God lets us go through things for a reason and maybe it's not just for us amen maybe what God's molding in US isn't just for us maybe it's for us and for someone else but he knows what he's doing he knows why He's doing it we just have to put our hand in his and trust him I want to read one last scripture together let's go to 2 Corinthians 2 Corinthians chapter 1 2 Corinthians chapter 1 verse3 blessed be God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies and the God of All Comfort who comforted Us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the Comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God for as the sufferings of Christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ and whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same same sufferings which we also suffer or whether we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvation the Apostle Paul now is is laying down a super important principle he said blessed be the God of All Comfort who comforteth us comforteth us in all our tribulation why that we might be able to comfort them which are in any way troubled Paul just realized he was going through trouble you don't need comforted unless you got trouble he wasn't being comforted for nothing he said I'm being comforted in my trouble so that I can learn how to comfort somebody else in their trouble with the comfort that I received then he goes on to make another statement in verse five for as the sufferings of Christ abound in US so our consolation also abound by Christ and whether we be afflicted it is your for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer what's he saying he said we're suffering we're suffering he says and whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation by saying I'm being Afflicted so that when you're Afflicted you can see that I was afflicted and you can be sold because you got the same thing I got that's what he's saying's breaking it down in plain English he's saying and we're afflicted for your consolation and salvation amen because you'll be suffering the same thing so you've got an example to look to and say hey he endured allander amen I'm comforted because this is nothing out of kilter with God is that how the is that what God did in the prophet for us he comforted him so he comforted us with the same comfort that he was comforted with but he also was afflicted amen for our comfort and salvation who will be afflicted with the same thing because we can look to him as an example and we can be comforted because if God will allow it in Paul God can allow it in me there's nothing wrong with Paul there's nothing wrong with me am amen all right we believe it in Paul and we believe it in brother brandham now do you believe it in yourself can God be doing things in our life just so somebody else can be comforted with our comfort amen or can God allow an Affliction in our life just so somebody else can be comforted at their time of Affliction when they say I saw you go through that and you held fast and God comforted you and it gives me courage to press on now am why does God let enemies remain in the land for us for our benefit yes are some of those enemies because of our mistakes yes they are is he using it for for our good yes he is don't ever give up friends don't ever lose heart don't ever forget who you are don't ever forget that the house of mourning is better than the house of Mirth am God loves me he's molding me and it may not be just for me it may be for me but it may be for someone else too it may be that God brings you through something just like he did Brother bham with his daughter so that that compassion and Love and Desire amen would would move to hundreds and thousands of other people and they would be blessed and delivered because of that maybe our testimony will set somebody else free amen maybe when we share what we've been through and what God's done for us it'll give somebody else courage to keep going and they'll keep going in the word and they'll be free let's not be narrow sided amen but let's look at the whole word and what brother the prophet taught us amen do things afflict us yes do enemies remain yes amen do they remain for a purpose yes Y and will they always remain I don't believe so I believe they'll go I have to believe they'll go I have to believe that the word will work I have to believe that this fight will finish this time it will finish if it comes again we'll fight again we have to believe until we press and press and press until finally The Last Enemy is defeated which is death amen we're all fighting against it we're all fighting against it and every day we get older we're fighting more and more this thing called death but The Last Enemy to be defeated is death and if it takes out a thousand more before we defeat it it doesn't matter we're going to defeat death Somebody by the grace of God and the power of almighty God is going to defeat death and take a body change and I believe it's going to be me if it's not me I'm going to believe it's me until the moment I'm I find myself in the sixth Dimension I'll be like well I guess it's not me anymore it'll be the next one keep pressing friends these things have to be this way don't let it discourage you just get back up and say praise God God's doing something amen God have glory in this work this too to your glory I don't know what you're doing I don't know how you're doing it amen the only thing I can do is what the prophet did when he was a young Minister I can just slip my hand in yours and trust you you know where I'm going and you know what you're trying to accomplish amen let's all Stand Together God is so good friends I am so thankful that God gave us this message so that our lives wouldn't be a big bundle of confusion why do we have all the word and we have all the power and the powers restored to the church and why am I still struggling with this amen you're still struggling with that because God has permitted it to mold you in a certain way and accomplish something for his kingdom and when he's done with it it'll be over just keep believing it'll be over nothing's without a purpose everything is working together for his perfect will amen let's just bow our heads together and pray as the musicians come dear Lord Jesus we thank you for your word God it's so beautiful Lord we can't even fathom it's so different than human mind thinks the way you think it's not like the way a human being thinks cuz your thoughts are not like our thoughts they're higher than our thoughts you see the end from the beginning you know what you're trying to accomplish you know the purpose behind everything God we truly can say we're sorry Lord for our mistakes we're sorry for our failures we're sorry for putting Canaanites under tribute so many times we're sorry for failing you in your word we're sorry but God we believe that you'll work it all for your glory would you take our mistakes and turn them for good Lord God we just give our lives to you and ask God that you would work your perfect plan in us help us not to doubt or to question Lord but help us just to believe help us to press forward Lord and may you do a work in us that would be a blessing to someone else and may you use our lives as a testimony with the good and the bad and everything mixed in between just like you did for the the prophet with the successes and the failures and the ups and the Downs May you put it all together Lord to display your great plan and your power and your word use us For Your Glory I pray God give us the courage to stay in the battle give us the faith to know that nothing is out of kilter that everything's ticking right on time Lord give us the faith to believe in who you said we are may we stay planted in the land where you've given us and may Lord you make every wrong right and may we be willing to testify may we be willing to own up to our failures and and confess them Lord but then let you work them for good God I pray that you bless all of us as a people may we go forward encourage Lord that no matter what happens something good will come out of it God we saw a man of God in this generation Afflicted we saw him we saw him uh we saw him hurt we saw him wounded we saw him as a child afflicted by poverty by rejection by alcoholism by all the things we saw him make his mistakes and suffer for his own mistakes we saw his family suffer for his mistakes we saw what others had done to him we saw what he did himself and in the end of it all we can say you were perfect in everything you did in every way it was perfect and it all worked together for good and I'm the recipient of that good God if you did it for one man you can do it for another you can do it for for me because I'm your child as well Lord and you can make all my wrongs right and you can make every Affliction and every sorrow turn to good and you can use it to comfort others you can use it to encourage others God help us to have faith like shamgar help us Lord to keep pressing to put our hand in yours and keep walking and keep trusting and keep believing regardless of what happens in our life God I pray that you give us the courage to keep pressing against the enemies they've got strongholds yes and we've let them stay too long that's true but I pray God you give us the courage to keep pushing against them and that you would give us victory over each one may we shine the light of your gospel everywhere we go bless your people bless us in this coming week many of us will be traveling visiting family having meals and all kinds of things Lord I pray God you would let us be a light that shines brightly wherever you put us Lord and wherever you lead us may we always remember the tremendous thing you've done for us Lord in this Christmas season
