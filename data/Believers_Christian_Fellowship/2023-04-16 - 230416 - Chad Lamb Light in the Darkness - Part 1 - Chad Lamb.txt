this morning certainly good to be here together and as we pray together I have a special prayer request I'd like for us all to pray together some of you may have heard but we heard tragic news that brother Jim McNulty had to go into the hospital with uh I think it was a blood infection it was determined it was septic and they had to amputate both of his legs and so that's a tragedy for the family for the McNulty family for brother Jim so I'd like as a congregation while we're standing just above our heads and pray for him together dear heavenly father God at times like this we have nowhere else to turn nor but to come to you who is the Strong Tower that the righteous run into are safe Lord our brother his family have just been struck Lord with a trial that is unimaginable Lord but God had never took you by surprise you're not shocked you know exactly what you're doing God we're going to put our trust and our confidence in you but we ask Lord that you would come and shelter this family that you would be a great comforter to them and their great time of need we pray that you would touch brother Jim and that you would heal him after this surgery restore his strength and allow him to go home well God their life has changed Lord but God may you work some Supernatural good through it all may they have a testimony of your goodness Lord Your Grace I pray to your comfort sister Karen and the children Lord God just be a friend let's stick it closer than a brother now is when they need you more than ever before Oh we as an assembly we love our brother God we ask that you would move over him comfort him encouraging give him Supernatural strength Lord and let your love envelop him and may he feel you as a tangible presence comforting him and guiding him back to strength and the family as well Lord this morning as we look into your word God I pray that you'd give us the strength we need to be all you've called us to be in this hour God for you have placed us here by your predetermined will by your foreknowledge you knew that we would be here you knew the obstacles we would face and do the condition of the world all around us but God you've equipped us Lord by predestination to meet the challenge of the hour and I pray God that you would come and give us more of yourself that we might have more strength more wisdom more understanding more light that we might know how to walk in this dark world may you reveal yourself to us in a greater way rub the I sap in our eyes Lord this morning that we might see you more clearly we ask for these things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you while we're standing let's turn to the book of Deuteronomy please Deuteronomy chapter 4 Deuteronomy chapter four I'd also like to let you know that um I had mentioned to you before the group that of X Amish that's down in Junction City Ohio that was baptized we were there where the Kyle and I were there to witness 17 of them being baptized and they called the man there who's the Elder in the group called and asked if we'd be able to come down and Minister for him so Brother Kyle will be going there next Sunday so the 23rd brother Kyle's going down the minister for that group so please be praying that God will give him inspiration and Leadership and wisdom to help them and then if things continue on as they are it looks like I'll be taking next month one of the services uh I think the 21st if I got that date right so just be praying that we can be a blessing to them and help them as they get started and move and the things have gone so it's really exciting to see what God is doing and it's exciting to be able to help him in any way we can so let's read while we're standing Deuteronomy chapter 4. verse 10. all right let's start at verse 9. Deuteronomy 4 and 9. only take heed to thyself and keep thy Soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen unless thou depart from thy heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy Sons Sons specially the day that thou stood us before the Lord thy God and them when the Lord said unto me gather me the people together and I will make them hear my words that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the Earth and that they may teach their children and you came near and stood under the mountain and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven with Darkness clouds and thick Darkness I want to highlight that statement there with Darkness clouds and thick darkness and the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire you heard the voice of the words but saw no similitude Only You Heard a Voice and he declared unto you his Covenant which he commanded you to perform even the Ten Commandments and he wrote them upon two tables of stone amen God bless us as we look at his word as you have your seats amen I want to take for a subject this morning light in the Darkness light in the darkness hear what Moses is speaking again to the children of Israel amen as they're coming to the end of their Wilderness Journey he's recapping many of the things that they've been through and bringing back to the remembrance their journey and here he reminds them of the day they stood in Mount Sinai and and I just went to the to point out verse 11 again if we just read that together and you came near and stood under the mountain and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven with Darkness clouds and thick darkness and so I I want to highlight that and then let's jump over to Exodus chapter 20 together Exodus chapter 20. and let's look at Verse 18 Exodus chapter 20 and verse 18. this is Moses now he's we're speaking of the same incidentally now we're in Exodus Exodus 2018 and all the people saw the thunderings and the Lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afar off and they said unto Moses speak that with us and we will hear but let not God speak with us lest we die and Moses said unto the people fear not for God has come to prove you and that his fear may be before your face that you sin not and the people stood afar off and Moses Drew near unto the thick Darkness where God was amen this is the part that I want to highlight when they saw the the smoking furnace and they heard the thunderings and the Lightnings and they saw the the the the the darkness the thick Darkness amen they ran away they ran away from the thick Darkness they ran away from the image they saw from the Thundering from the shakings they stood afar off and they asked Moses to go for them because they couldn't go but it said then Moses I'll read this let's read this together verse 21 and the people stood afar off and Moses Drew near unto the thick Darkness where God was amen if you think about this they saw an image that terrified them something that they physically could not handle they were supposed to come up into the mountain but instead when God descended upon the mountain this way it was such a fearful sight that they fled from God even Moses said he feared and quaked amen but they fled away but it says Moses Drew near into the thick Darkness the very thing that they were afraid of Moses Drew near into the thick Darkness where God was God was right in the midst of that scary scene amen God was right in the midst of that fearful sign God was in the thick Darkness so what was in the thick Darkness light amen what in Moses who did Moses meet when he got into the thick Darkness he met God Amen God was there what did God give him God gave him his word which is his light his illumination there was light in the middle of the thick Darkness amen but it scared everybody away amen but Moses approached unto the thick Darkness where God was amen you can see why amen there's so many scarecrows and so many things that frighten people away from the true revelation of God but I'm telling you he's in the thick Darkness amen and then if we could bring the PowerPoint up I want to go through some quotes I got quite a few scriptures and quotes I want to read so I put them in a PowerPoint so I can move quickly through it so we want to discuss light in the darkness amen First Kings 8 10 and 12 were at the dedication of the temple that Solomon built he says and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the Holy place that the cloud filled the house of the Lord so that the priest could not stand to minister because of the clown for the glory the lord had filled the house of the Lord then spake Solomon the Lord said that he would dwell in the thick Darkness amen so the Lord said he would dwell in the thick Darkness where was he on Mount Sinai in the thick Darkness where was he in the temple in the thick Darkness amen so so I mean it it some things look dark and frightening amen and many times it's God amen praise the Lord amen things when we start to look at the Bible and we start to look and apply it to life we begin to realize that there's nothing new Under the Sun and the Bible explains everything even then it becomes a living book for us and many of the things that we were afraid of before become Revelations to us ways in which we see the light in Exodus 14 verse 19 . this is The Exodus Journey after they've left Egypt amen and they're they're in the wilderness and now they're up against the Red Sea and Pharaoh's Army is coming it says in the angel of God which went before the camp Israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them and it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel and it was a cloud of Darkness to them but it gave light by night to those to these so the one came not near the other all night what was this this was the pillar of fire this was the manifestation of God in that day and so God was now standing between the armies of pharaoh and between the children of Israel amen and the pillar of fire had moved itself there amen and it was standing there the angel of the Covenant the Lord Jesus Christ was standing there to separate the two it was Darkness to them but it was light to those to these it depended on who you were and depended on what you saw amen so to some amen the the very manifestation of the word was Darkness to others it was light to some it was fearful and kept them at Bay to others it gave them the light they meant to walk by as they walked through the Red Sea so you can see how God Amen he hides himself in thick Darkness but as Solomon said God said he would be in the thick Darkness so they looked and saw black angry billowing clowns that would keep the Chariots back amen but the children of Israel was a bright light to walk by amen and we live in a day amen we're God where the pillar of fire has returned back and the word is coming to full manifestation and to many it's Darkness but depending on where you are Amen in your perspective and what camp you're in to some it's Darkness it's a mystery it's uncomprehendable it's Unthinkable but to us it's light to walk by amen and it brings the separation between the two camps what separated them amen what separated them is what they saw because they saw the darkness and held back others saw the light and moved forward so what brought the separation was the manifestation of the word praise be to God in John 1 1 we we know this so well but I love this scripture in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not that's the way it's always been in every age as the word comes into manifestation it's a light Amen in the word is life and that life is the light of men so in the word is life and that life is light illumination light to walk by amen but this light now is always shining the darkness of this Earth amen It Shine in the darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not amen but praise God there were some who comprehended it and when Jesus Christ came he was this word made Flash and when he came he is the light of the world he said I am the light of the world Amen but many who saw him didn't see light when they saw him they saw Darkness amen they saw a human being stoop shouldered 30 years old looked like he was 50 uh with a reputation of an illegitimate birth coming out of a place called Nazareth all they could see was Darkness Darkness Darkness where was where was God he was in the midst of the darkness amen hiding himself in the darkness of a human figure amen that that had no coming this that we should desire him amen that didn't come as a bright shining light outwardly came as a human being amen and probably not the way brother Brahm describes it amen not the most glorious strong tall amen he came as a humble human being in the form of a humble human being amen and his birth was questionable more Darkness and the city he lived in was undesirable more Darkness and the religious leaders of the world rejected him more darkness and more darkness and more Darkness until the people were afraid to draw near the thick Darkness but what was in that Darkness was the light the life amen but thank God there was some who wanted to draw near to what others saw as Darkness they saw as light amen praise God in Matthew 4 12 scripture says now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in Capernaum which is upon the Seacoast and in the borders of Zebulon and Nephilim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying the land of zebulun and the land of Nephilim by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles this is the land of the Gentiles and look at our timing when Jesus heard that John was cast in the prison John's Ministry is now ending Jesus now is coming on the scene and where is he at in the land of the Gentiles what's the next line people with satin Darkness saw great life and then which sat in the region in the shadow of death light has sprung up from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand amen do you see your day amen do you see your day amen Christ is now come on the scene and the land of the Gentiles and light has sprung up in darkness and the in the place of the shadow of death light has sprung up amen and in laodicea which is at the end of the laodicean church age brother Branham said it's a complete blackout a total apostasy in the church amen and where does the light the light is sprung up Amen in the shadow of death Hallelujah God is so good Job 38 verse 4. where was thou when I laid the foundation of the earth God's now bringing his attention to Creation declared if thou has understanding who hath laid the measure thereof without knowest or who has stretched the line upon it whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the Cornerstone thereof when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for Joy or who showed up to see with doors when it breaks forth as if it had issued out of the womb when I made the cloud the Garment thereof in thick Darkness a swaddling band for it and break up it for and break up for it my decreed place and set bars and doors and said hitherto shall Thou come but no further and there shall thy proud waves be stayed so the the highlighted portion there it says when I made a cloud the Garment thereof in thick Darkness a swaddling band so we find in Genesis 1 that the Earth is shrouded in darkness and this is what God is speaking to in job he goes I made the cloud the Garment thereof I wrapped it in a clown and thick Darkness a swaddling band for it so the Earth is wrapped in thick Darkness we see that in Genesis chapter one in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth period and now we're going to find it in the form he spoke to De job the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters amen there was a thick Darkness all over the Earth amen it was a swaddling band of thick Darkness but praise God in the fourth seal brother Birmingham tells us there was something in that Darkness says I was talking to a person not long ago he was trying to discuss with me and saying aren't you ashamed to say that God created the heavens and the Earth in three days or in six days I said that's what the Bible said well we've got evidence and can prove that the world is millions of years old I said that didn't have anything to do with it in Genesis 1 1 it said in the beginning God created the heavens and earth period see that's all now the world without form and void and I said I believe every seed was laying right there from some other civilization or something and as soon as the water lifted off of the the light Struck it and up come the trees and everything so I get back because I don't want to read the rest of the quote yet so so now brother Ben saying that we find Earth in a form of judgment Amen in the cloud is its garment and it's swaddled and swallowing band of thick Darkness but brother Benham says underneath there is seeds amen and they're germatized seeds with life inside of them what's in the thick Darkness life is laying there the potential waiting for something it's in the thick Darkness amen it wasn't I mean it wasn't what you thought there's nothing here there's nothing good here oh yes there's something laying there and in the right condition out of the thick darkness is going to come life and so we know that God by a spoken word begins by the word to create the condition that's right and part the clouds and bring the line and when he does the light strikes the seed and the seed comes forth to life and shows that there was life in the thick Darkness there was there was life laying there dormant waiting for the right season it wasn't dead it wasn't scary it was a Rejuvenation of life but then here's what brother bam says next he says the same thing with the human being it's a type when all the Mist has moved away and the revealed truth to that real seed laying there still germatized and the light of the gospel and Strike It by a true Vindication the word it'll live it's got life in it amen we come into this world born in sin shaped in iniquity coming to the world speaking lies shrouded in darkness but some have a seed from a previous civilization or something and that seed has life in it amen and what's in the thick Darkness the in the thick darkness is a child of God waiting to be expressed an attribute a portion of God a piece of the word and where is it it's wrapped in the thick darkness of Fallen Humanity of a fallen human being born wrong come hybrid come into the world speaking lies with a mind alienated and darkened to the things of God completely overshadowed with the cloud completely swaddled in a thick Darkness but down in there is an attribute of God life it's got life in it praise God you know this message came to give us a true identification this message didn't come Amen to create another religious movement another founder with a set of teachings that has nothing to do with what this message is it's not a Founder with a set of teaching amen it is an actual peeling open of the revelation of God himself so that you know who you really are so you'll never be stumbled again amen you were born wrong brother Ben said of no fault of your own amen it happened in the Garden of Eden you come subject to that swallowed uh swaddled and Fallen Humanity but oh praise God there was a seed with life in it laying there and what was that seed listen friends that seed that you that that seed was not you as far as a hybrid creature that seed is a portion of God himself so what is their word and the word has life and the life is light so what's in the midst of Darkness there's a little piece of light laying down there shrouded in darkness that's why for me I don't count anybody out I don't count anybody out because we all come wrapped in darkness overshadowed totally alienated to the things of God Amen just because somebody's walking around swaddled in complete darkness and in a thick cloud of humanity and you can see the thick cloud of Fallen State all around them amen that doesn't mean that there's no life inside of there it doesn't mean there's no seed there amen I don't know where it's at only God knows where it's at but when God by the spoken word begins to bring the right condition to that piece of Earth amen that life will Spring forth so when it looks like nothing good is there amen they said can anything good comes out of Nazareth amen it's rumored that his mother amen had an affair with the soldier and he's the product of adultery amen can anything good come out of that amen yes something good can come out of that because God is coming out of that anything good come out of the thick Darkness yes it can brother man I'm speaking here of John chapter 4 and John chapter 4 is the story of the woman at the well when he had needs to go by Samaria amen and he says that woman knowed more about the scripture than them priests did I'll say one thing she know more about it him than a lot of preachers today that's right yes sir yes she knew him why I believe that that seed of eternal life laid within the woman and when the light flashed on it quickly she recognized it amen let's turn to John chapter four and let's just look at this quickly I believe we're going to spend some time in this in another service but I just want to hit just a point or two here Jesus begins a dialogue with the woman in John chapter four she's a Samaritan he's a Jew supposedly and and he begins his dialogue because he had needs to go by Samaria because he's led by the father amen because he's seeking and saving that which is lost amen it was lost but it hadn't always been lost because in order to lose something you have to have it first so if he's seeking and saving that which is lost then there's something that he had attributes of himself that are now in a lost condition and he's there seeking those pieces of himself that's lost praise God and let's go let's just pick it up in verse 19. the woman said unto him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship Jesus is saying that her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship you know not what we know what we worship for the Salvation for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshiper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth this woman has been asking um she's up to this point she's been asking natural questions how will you get this water you don't have a bucket he said I'll give you water he's speaking spiritual she's thinking natural yeah then he begins to address the condition in her life you've got five husbands the one this is all natural and then she says I perceive you're a prophet because you can discern my life now where do I worship do I go in Jerusalem or worship she's looking at a natural place or on this mountain do I worship and and he keeps giving spiritual answers amen he's not trying to hit her intellect he's trying to go deeper than that he's not trying to convince her of the right way to bring a sacrifice in the right place and the Jews haven't been in the Samaritans and our doctrine's a little better than your Doctrine and he's trying to get down to that Soul where that life is and he's trying to bring some light of the word to strike that seed amen so he's speaking spiritually he said God is a spirit and they that worship we must worship Him in spirit and Truth he's breaking apart all of her normals everything that's normal is breaking apart I mean she's asked the question okay so there's a big there's a big religious debate is it Jerusalem that we worship is it Samaria I've heard both and Jesus just abolishes all her understanding and saying the father is not seeking any to worship that way anymore but we're moving to another dispensation and God wants a worshiper to worship Him in spirit and in truth not in physical location and you this is this is an uneducated unthiologically trained woman and he's not trying to appeal to her mind he's trying to bring light to that scene now look at her response and the woman saith unto him I know that messiah's cometh and he's called Christ when he has come he will tell us all things she was recognizing this is different now if a Pharisee had been standing there the Pharisee would put up a good argument because no the law says and Moses told us in the furniture and then Solomon established and David said and you can't just change everything right we're sticking with the scriptures amen we're sticking with Moses and what David commissioned when Solomon established and what was returned when we came out of Babylon and God spoke amen through the prophets and it's a rubable building they had lots of scriptures amen but the scriptures were telling them historically what happened but all the scriptures were pointing to another happening and now Jesus is moving above the technicals of textbooks and he's coming to the real heart the real transition period and the real truth of the spirit and what God is seeking and there's a woman here who's not getting caught up in the textbook religion she's able to sense that's true amen and the only person who's going to give us these kind of answers is Messiah when he comes he'll tell us all things and Jesus says I am he that speaketh to you you know he doesn't do that anywhere else amen he goes around they ask him to tell us plainly who you are and he never answers them but until he finds a predestinated seed because he always reveals himself to the predestinated scene it's a I was speaking to them he and upon this came his disciples now watch this scripture an opponents came his disciples and marveled that he talked with the woman because all they could see was thick Darkness they marveled that he talked to this woman I mean she's a Samaritan she's obviously coming at the wrong hour of the day indicating she's not a clean woman she's not got a good reputation and you guys are here alone and we've been gone and we come back and you're talking to this woman and they marveled and he talked to the woman because all they could see was the thick Darkness but Jesus knew what was in the thick Darkness was a peace of God a seed Gene of God was laying in the thick Darkness so Jesus wasn't afraid of the thick Darkness he wasn't afraid to approach to the thick Darkness I hope we're not afraid to approach those that are wrapped in thick Darkness amen Jesus was Secure in who he was so he wasn't afraid to approach this woman I hope we're secure enough in Who We Are that the thick Darkness on the outside of people doesn't scare us away because we're looking for seed we're looking for light we're looking for a piece of God hiding in the thick Darkness amen so we see now brother van tells us that about this woman that she there was a seed of eternal life laid within that woman and she recognized it she was wrapped in thick Darkness you agree with me on that didn't look good didn't look like a place of Life didn't look like there was any life down in there amen but Jesus was led to this piece of Earth to speak the word To Shine the Light the Light Strike the seed to bring the seed to life right and then it's amazing what what transpires after this I want to look at a scripture if I can remember where okay yeah let's go to Second Corinthians 11. second Corinthians 11 I want to contrast her with the religious leaders of the day second Corinthians 11. second Corinthians 11 and 13. so second Corinthians 11 13 for such are false Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself has transformed to an angel of Light therefore there's a no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works this is an amazing statement when you come to Satan Satan has transformed himself as an angel of Light and Satan is not thick Darkness [Music] he looks good many times it's the the real genuine seed of God that looks like thick Darkness what did the woman who washed Jesus feet look like compared to Simon Simon the Pharisee was religious he was clean on the outside he had everything going for him he made broad his phylacteries he made big boastful speeches on the corner he sat on the highest chief of seats he blew a trumpet every time he dropped his money into the tributary amen where where then the the little woman put two mites in and Jesus noticed that and said she gave more and now here comes a woman that is caught in adultery a man stuck in this horrible lifestyle amen but she recognizes Jesus Christ is in their midst unwelcomed amen and unkissed and uncared for and she runs in with the alabaster box to break an anoint his feet amen and she's doing all of this amen you stand back with humanistic eyes she's dark amen Simon is light but he has transformed himself into an angel's line amen but there's no life inside of him because if there was life inside of him he would have received the light that was Jesus Christ here's a woman in darkness and a dark life and everything about her is dark amen but she can see the light amen what was a cloud to one was a pillar of fire to another it was confusion to the to the religious things it's all confusion how could he be and it doesn't match what we think scripture should say and Bethlehem and this and a mighty deliver this and and it's all confusion to her it made perfect sense this is none other than Jesus Christ this is the messiah and she ran in there proving that shouted in her Darkness was light there was a seed of life down on the inside let's turn to Matthew 23. Matthew 23. and 27. Matthew 23 and 27. woe once you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites fear like unto why did sepulchers which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness this is what religion produces every time religious religion will produce a Whited Sepulcher it will produce religion is not going to bring life the word brings life religious forms and rituals and that doesn't bring life the word brings life the light of the hour brings the seed of the hour to life and so the Pharisees and and scribes and hypocrites they were they were outwardly not wrapped in darkness but inward it was Darkness for the woman at the well and the woman the adulterous woman who washed Jesus feet outwardly they were Darkness but inside there was a seed of light amen so God knows how to hide himself in the Darkness amen it's amazing that after the day of Pentecost when when the disciples go running onto the street performing Miracles testifying preaching the gospel amen Peter and John they went by the gate beautiful they healed a man who was a leper they got called on the carpet so to say and they got questioned about it and they said these men are ignorant unlearned I mean how I'm sure they were completely Bamboozled we've studied all our lives we we do all of this but and but look at what's happening look at what they're doing something is wrong because they look and see Darkness but there's Life coming out of darkness and they can't comprehend it and they're afraid of it and they're afraid to come near it amen but those who aren't afraid of it can come right into Christ praise God all right I'm going to keep moving I don't want to get hung up too much so then in God's provided place of worship says as I said the other day when God moved and struck the sun across the Earth he node them palm trees and everything was laying down under the Earth they were part of the earth at the time so were you and when he raised up the Son of God on Easter morning he sent forth the Holy Spirit it was to Quicken also that seed of eternal life that he foreknew before the foundation of the world that would be there would be here God knew that she would be here he sent the Holy Spirit to Quicken that seed to life amen for the scripture says in second Corinthians 4 6 for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts he caused the light to shine out of where out of Darkness first it was Darkness then light come out of Darkness then our hearts our minds were darkened to the things of God so then God shined the light in our Dark Places amen so he shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ the message is super sign the prophet says the Solar Sun the Solar Sun up there s-u-n has control of all botany life when a seed is laying there and that sun strikes it it'll come to life yes sir and the s-o-n of God is the controller of all eternal life and if you've got a seat of life in you brother when that son strikes there and shows you what he is it comes to life there's no way of keeping it from it there's so many things that I want to go into so I just pray just just keep pulling amen I want to stop and relax for just a minute because we we get the wrong Notions about so many things because religious Notions they have a way of hanging on to us even though we don't want them to amen we want to lose everything but we hang them on and and we we have such a notion in ourselves about how we must approach unto God and and you know we must repent of these things and confess all the wrong things we've done and start doing right things and as we start doing right things we'll we'll become clean and then we can begin to approach unto God and God will accept us because he can see all of our efforts we're trying to live for him and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah it's our old denominational religious order that's failed it has failed over and over and over and over again it wasn't the plan of God the plan of God was to bring the light amen and when the light strikes the seed the seed comes to life that's God's plan amen we're going to go into that a little bit more and show how much of God's plan that is amen because when we start amen if we preach the gospel the wrong way and preach it in a Reformation message amen you're going to get people stuck in reformation and they're never going to move on with God Amen because they're going to always trying to reform reform so I can approach them to God and God will honor all my efforts and then he'll he'll give me more gifts or he'll bless me and put me into his kingdom and that's not the way it works amen it was everything amen oh my goodness everything that he wants out of your life he put in the seed and he planted that seed in dirt and it's shrouded in darkness and there's a cloud over top of it but he knows by the spoken word for your day how to change the conditions of your Earth so that the light strikes the seed inside and if it's a germinated seed it'll bring it to life and that seed will produce what's already in the seed Hallelujah so we've been taught through religious realms to try to manufacture a life before the light strikes the seed and it fails and that's why religious forms especially those that that are are more bent that direction have to come up with morals and more orders and more structure and more this and more programs and and more because what we're trying to do is reform the people we're trying if I could say it this way we are trying to get a rose bush to bloom when the lights never struck the sea I hope that makes sense so when the son strikes there it comes to life there's no way of keeping it from it when the True Light amen not the light that shined in another day but the light designated for this day the word made manifest in this day the revealed word of the hour is the light of the hour and the light of the hour is a certain light for a certain condition to match a certain seed and the seed of this hour will only come to life by the light of this hour and when the light of this hour strikes the seed of the hour you can't stop it from coming to life so what people don't need is our religion they need the word they don't they don't need religious order religious instruction what they need is the true revelation of the word and the true revelation of the word will do the work so when a Pharisee comes to God Amen he goes to school he gets orders he finds all the rituals and they've added to so much of evil God God required amen they add certain things to their costume they they add certain rituals they add certain Washings of pots and Washings at hand and he learns all of these things to approach unto God where there was a little woman out of well who had learned nothing amen but she come in contact with the Living Word The Living Word identified her showed her her condition showed her the place of worship and showed her that he is the messiah and immediately she dropped her water pot and ran into the City and said come see a man that told me everything I've ever done is not this the Messiah she didn't go to school she didn't get an order and Jesus never said now make sure you do this and don't forget to do that and before you go out witnessing make sure you do this the point was not to whitewash a Sepulcher the point was to bring life and the life would propagate more life and by her testimony and listen the Pharisee also when he was going through his religious order the Pharisee was doing everything to appear a certain way in the eyes of others so the Pharisees religion was self-serving does that make sense we say why do people love to be stuck in religious rigid systems like that because they look good they get something out of it listen I like structure rules and order my nature just fits in really nice and and I could flourish in a legalistic system is that right but somebody with a different nature than me can never flourish in that restrictive system they don't have that nature in them so in that system I would always be the good boy and they would always be the bad boy and because I could flourish and structure an order and rigidness and I may not like it but I can do it because they never could then I see that they fail but I succeed so now I'm saved and have the Holy Ghost and they don't so now my security is all in this system and it's completely wrong praise God I hope the devil gets stomped on hard today and exposed I hope the veil gets peeled back and we recognize that that's not it that's not what God's looking for he didn't want this woman to have to go through a school in certain structures and certain things like that amen she come to life and she ran and her testimony was not pointing anyone to herself her testimony says it's him look at him he's the Messiah surely he's not this the Messiah and the people never stopped at her and praised her glorious transformation no they went from her right back to the same source and come to the light themselves praise be to God that's it does it mean that she should continue on an adultery no does it mean she has to continue no because the life inside the seed will produce its own life amen if she had that experience as he was genuine see she will change the way she addresses she will change the places she goes she will change her relationships it will all change by a natural process of staying in the light and the light bringing life out of the seed and the seed bearing its own fruit [Music] not system fruit genuine Christ fruit so she never her testimony listen I'll tell you it's something too her testimony didn't make her look good because he exposed all the bad things I've ever done that's the Messiah he he tore apart my religious ideas until I feel like I don't know nothing about the Bible that doesn't make you look good it's not this the Messiah isn't this the truth isn't this the real Christ in our day amen he's so peeled away so demolished My Religion so demolished my traditions until I don't even think I even know what this Bible is what it's about I don't know anything I thought I knew but now I don't know isn't this the Messiah praise be to God brother Branham he's in communion this is the last uh sermon as we have recorded that he preaches before he passes away he says like in the book here and the spot there was a talking about the two books being one The Book of Life The First Book of Life coming up was when you were born that was your natural birth but then one time way back down in there there was a little grain of life as I was explaining some of the young sisters at the house this afternoon see there's a little grain of Life laying there what you wonder where did it come from what the Australian listen you didn't get that seed later that seed was always in you brother man was explaining this where did it come from well these strange things I was saying this taking for myself like you was going to say William Branham well 40 years ago the William Branham it isn't the same one tonight if somebody back there would say William random he was a rank Rascal why he was shrouded in darkness he was swaddled in humanity amen now he's a ranked Rascal see because I was born of Charles and Ella Branham in their nature I was a sinner I came to the world a liar and all the habits of the world laid right in me but down in there too was another nature of presence didn't come later it was there it's always been in you it's part of you there was another nature presidency predestinated was in there by God in this same body see two Natures in there well I only catered to the one as I growed I grewed as a baby Dada first thing you know I come a liar become everything else that is sinner because I raised up that way but down in there was a little speck of Life all the time when he was a ranked Rascal a sinner amen when when when he took his gun to go murder the boys that beat him that was dark but in the darkness was a sieging of God which was life which is light amen I'm so glad I when I recognized I was born I was born in a fallen condition my Earth was just as much in judgment as the Earth was in Genesis 1 2. this piece of Earth was standing in the same kind of judgment condition that that Earth was I was clouded my mind was clouded alienated from God with no understanding of God I was swaddled in the thick darkness of hybrid flesh but there was a seed from a previous civilization laying down in that Earth and all it needed was to come in contact under the right condition with the Sun and the sun in the right position would bring life out of that seed I couldn't save myself clean myself make myself perform but the life in the seed coming to life makes me what I always wanted to be not not even by my will but by his predestinated will not even it doesn't matter how much we desire oh I want to be a Son of God oh I want to serve God you can desire it all you want amen but your desire will never produce it it will be produced from the life on the inside when the Holy Spirit comes to that seed and quickens that seed to life and under the under the light of the word of God the spirit of God nurturing that seed bringing it into its full potential will produce the life you can never by willpower produce amen that's why I I find Within Myself such a resistance to critical spirits because critical Spirits are criticizing everybody else and finding fault all the time and those critical Spirits finally I think some people think it's a gift but it's not one of the gifts of the Spirit but see that critical spirit all the time is always taking away diminishing ridiculing and the one who sits in the house was the critic becomes the expert you see criticism automatically even if the critic isn't inflating themselves they're automatically sitting in a higher position even if they don't say anything about themselves the fact that they're criticizing puts them in a higher position because now I find your faults and I just I I even used to be good at it I hate that thing now it's wickedness it's evil because as if I criticize somebody I'm going to get them to produce a better life like what is my criticism going to do when what they need is nurture under the light amen not criticism they need to be nurtured in the light of the word they need more word amen more a more a sunlight more word a better condition to bring forth more fruit they don't need criticism they need nurture under the word right so I say that's what I needed criticism never did me any good amen all it did was bring discouragement it caused me to have self-doubts it made me want to pull away Chris has never helped me but when somebody would come and nurture me in the word and just love me and encourage me and live a life before me it always inspired me to live a greater life amen praise God now I I hope you know me long enough to know it I don't mean bypassing sin and overlooking it and acting like it's not there Sin is Sin but a lot of what we criticize is just immaturity people just need to grow up they need a little patience amen Ephesians 4 17 says this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that ye henceforth walked not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their hearts he's telling you don't walk like this anymore that's how you used to walk that's how other Gentiles walk but this is not how you're supposed to walk why because he's revealed the word Ephesians 5 8 for ye were sometimes Darkness but now are you light in the Lord walk as children of the light amen we were Darkness but praise God we are now manifested as children of the light because there was a seed of life of light inside communion now this is finishing the quote where brother miniman started before what was it there was another William Branham see a little spot of eternal life down there from the genes of God the word of God that was placed in there each one of you can think of similar things it was working brother man was talking about he would look at nature and he would ask questions Little Flower last winter I I built a fire over top of you and now you're coming forward where did you come from and he's asking all these questions he said that was that little seed of life was stirring back then it was with him always a sieging of God a spot of eternal life it was always there amen what it needed is it needed to move into the right condition by the spoken word to bring it to life but it was there you see it was working not paragraph 50. then then look up to the trees and I think Leaf I seen you fall off last year where are you back there again where'd you come from what brought you here it was the eternal life working in the body now then one day as I walked on that voice talking don't never smoke drink or so forth and the young fellows and all got older see there was something moving but yet all at once I looked up and I said I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Brandon there's something calling like my little Eagle I'm not a chicken there's something up yonder somewhere oh great Jehovah wherever you are open up I want to come home there's something in me calling then I was born again that little life was laying there the life of water was poured upon it then it began to grow now the old life was forgiven put in the sea of God's forgetfulness to Never Be Remembered against me no more see now we stand Justified as though we never had sinned in the presence of God praise God oh what brought this birth a realization a revelation light striking the scene and broken cisterns he says it's just like I was speaking the other night about this little Eagle walking in the barnyard with the chicken and he never know nothing else but the chickens but he knowed there was something about him was different from the chickens and when his mother came hunting him and she screamed from above it was an eagles call Sea and he had to be an eagle to begin with or he would have never recognized that call see there has to be something there dermatized or it can never produce life and if the seed the word of God is in you the holy spirit is here now to dermatize that and bring it to a reality to you there has to be seed with life already in it down in you or you'll never hear it amen when the eagle scream went the chicken scattered amen but the eagle that was an eagle on the inside when the chicken scattered it looked up and said that sounds good to me that's why when so many people that we know heard the message to them the message is Darkness confusion scary stay away from me God doesn't work through prophets anymore it's it's a false Doctrine you're changing the Trinity amen there's all kinds of Darkness fearful Darkness but if you can have the courage to approach unto the darkness you'll find the light is in the darkness amen in the confusion and the different Doctrine different teaching I don't understand this I was raised all my life my grandparents were good people and they didn't believe this way and Darkness Darkness and how could one man be right and how could that man be the authority and a prophet and God doesn't even use prophets anymore Darkness Darkness Darkness amen but everybody runs from the darkness but Moses didn't run from the darkness and when Moses went into the darkness he received the word praise God amen it's not that it's not scary Moses trembled and Quake you got to go get you got to get past So Many religious Notions Traditions training friends and relationships former pastors and and family members pulling you back it's not that it's not fearful but yet Moses knew that that was God and he went anyways praise be to God and God's power to transform this is the part that I was mentioning earlier but I want to spend some time and through a seat of his word there's only one thing that can Quicken the word and that is the spirit for it is the life Giver to the word and when the life in the word meets the life of the spirit it produces whatever the seed is how many believe you're an end time sieging of God predestinated to be here in the end time right by the grace of God nothing you did but you just believe it anyhow you can't you can't help but believe it not that you put it there not that you made it happen not that you did anything yourself but you just can't help it I just believe it and I believe I'm a I see Gene of God an attribute of God a portion of God a portion of the word that he is designated for an expression in the very end time right so there's all kinds of seeds that can be planted if we think if you just think with me for a minute we can plant all kinds of vegetables and fruit seeds and and they all have seasons and they all have times that they come up and produce their fruit and so when God wanted a certain kind of harvest a certain kind of crop he planted a certain seed so he planted a certain seed in Paul's day spend a certain seed in Luther's day a certain seed was planted for Wesley's day amen but we weren't planted in those days there's a certain season of time and a certain seed to produce and bear a certain fruit in a certain season and God is the master gardener remember God started the Bible with a garden and in the end he takes his bride back to a garden the whole thing is about sowing seed bringing a harvest in return it's all about seed and harvest seed and fruit the whole Bible is a garden what is the bride a garden she's a garden enclosed the shut up a spring closed up she's a garden to her husband and so now The Gardener has planted the right seed for the right time and by predestination he knew what portion of himself would come forth In Your Vessel in this decreed season and so he knows that it's not an early spring Sun that'll bring the seed because it's not peace it's not snow peace it's not lettuce we're getting a later crop so he knows that it's going to take the full power of the sign to bring this seed to life so in this day he brought the full power of the word by the full revelation of the word because there was a seed in you that needed the full power of the light to be restored to bring this seed to life it was laying here couldn't spring forth under Luther's message couldn't spring forth under Wesley's visit but had to Spring forth under the light of the hour and that light that message that word and he says the words that I speak unto you their spirit in their life and so that Spirit of that word comes in and connects to the word laying in you and brings the word the seed word in you to life and then produces whatever that word is right amen that's why if we're a seed for this age we will not produce Luther life we will not produce Wesley life we will not produce Pentecost Pentecostal life but we will produce bright life because it's a bright scene and you have to say brother Ted will I produce bright Life by you know more effort I got more rules I now know I don't think it works like that in God's power to transform he says in everything under control to bring forth of its kind now remember to bring when he put the seed in the Earth the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it oh I hope you catch this I hope this breaks religion the sea can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was his transforming power now God put the seed in there with potentials that it would be what he said it would be and as long as it stayed in its right category it would be just exactly what God said it would be it had to be that way because he had made it that way and made a channel that anything that stays in his channel in his line of word it will have to bring forth exactly like his word said it would do it cannot move from there it's channeled just exactly right so with everything in the trust in his own son that it would be that way then God said it's all good so I'll just rest and each one of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the species that I Desi that I desire it to be oh don't leave this in Genesis 1 2. bring it home you all raise your hand and said by Faith by the grace of God and by faith in that Grace you believe that you're a sieging of God predestinated for this hour amen then God already put the potential of what he wants it to be inside the gene not in your mind not in your will not in your mental power not in your strength the the the the to hold yourself back he put it in the gene amen a portion of himself a portion of word to be expressed this day amen and as long as we stay in the channel of the word laying in the presence of the sun amen as it continues to reveal itself it will bring all the potential out of the seed oh praise God this is me so much rest because I can't produce anything in my own power amen and so if I'm left in myself to be a bride I'm going to be the worst failure of bride there ever was but God did not leave it to me because he knew I would come shrouded in darkness clouded over with a mind alienated from God wrapped in hybrid flesh amen and he knew that I was going to come in that condition so he planted a seed inside of me and put the overcoming in the seed he didn't put it in my flash he didn't put in my mind he put it in the seed amen and then he's got a law amen and God's law always works when that germatized seed with life already and it comes in contact with the living word amen it'll spring forth the life and if it stays in that channel it'll pull out of it all the fruit that's already inside oh praise God brother tell you what why can't I overcome what do I have to do I'm telling you just stay in this word and let God wash away every form of religion and every idea of man and just keep feeding on the word it will bring life itself it'll just happen amen you'll look back at some point and say I I don't remember when I overcame that amen I can testify that of my life amen all of a sudden amen the word begins to do things I in willpower never was capable of doing myself but the word we just stay in the word and feed on the word and as he opens the word we rejoice in the word and stay in the presence of the word and then all of a sudden things begin to change amen and we grow but the growing is so gradual you don't really recognize it day by day and then at some point you look back and say I I am not struggling with that anymore when and then you go back I don't know if you've done this but I have when did it leave what was the moment what was there a prick in my heart that I have a sensation and no there's sometimes I cannot point when it left it just left some things just vanished and I can't tell you how some things left by degrees gradually slipping away losing its hold bit by bit then you find yourself having more Victory now I've had Victory all day now I've had Victory three days now I've had victory for a week my goodness I used to never be able to go an hour without this and never three hours I couldn't stop this thought from running through my head and now it's been a whole week and what's happening staying in the channel if that seed will stay in the proper Channel because God's laws work now listen if this seed will only flourish under the light of the age but I continually keep it from the light of the age and keep giving it to Satan's light of the age from the fourth dimension then I'm going to stunt the girls we're not going to get any more potentials out of it it doesn't change the plant it doesn't change the fact that the Son of God it doesn't change that the potentials are there but you can't you're out of the channel you can't produce the life so we're feeding on entertainments of the world and feeding on things of the world and wrong relationships and wrong conversations and we're not staying under the right atmosphere in the right Channel and then we're wondering why we're struggling to overcome so we're going to try harder but but the trying harder is not going to work can you might testify trying harder doesn't work praise God I'm glad I'm not all by myself because I tried harder and harder and then harder and harder and harder and the harder I tried the worse I fell so then so then having the the getting out of the channel will stop the growth will stop amen producing the potentials but will not change the plant that's why when you got discouraged and you backslid you never changed that you were a son of God and you may not have been producing any fruit and all of the leaves might have been falling off and your limbs might have been wilting down but in the root you were still Son of God and you couldn't change it because you didn't start it you didn't decide it you didn't choose it it was predestinated in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and you may be dried up and wilted and all your leaves laying down the fruits long gone the Bark's starting to come off but it doesn't change what you are and if you will just get in the fresh water of the word and under this bright August sunlight amen you'll find that the health will come back to the plant it'll spring back up again the limbs will raise up it'll put forth leaves buds flowers and then fruits but you're not going to do it in the wrong Channel trying to I'll get better and then come back you can't do it but the seed inside has all the potential to be everything he predestinated it to be so what do I do stay in the channel it doesn't do any good to stay in the channel and then pour dirty water over your plant all the time we've got to stay clean listen there's we have choices to make we get to make decisions and that decisions depends on our spiritual health we don't keep dumping dirty water on a plant we want to prosper but we stay under the Clean Water of the word and stay under the sun it's going to keep drawing potential potentials you didn't even know was laying there will start coming out if you stay in the right atmosphere it's a challenge for all of us amen we're stuck in this world we have to go to work we have associations we have things that we have to do we're bombarded by all kinds of things all the time but I want to take the challenge and I hope you take the challenge with me let's try to stay in the right Channel and see what God can do to stay on the right Channel stay in the right Fellowship hear the right things stay in the word amen feed on the word stay under the sun don't let the dirty water keep getting poured over don't move out from under the sunlight stay here and watch the potentials take off I love this I'm going to read this last sentence again because I just love it that's what it must be because I have given every seed transforming power every seed has within it transforming power it's not you living a Christian Life it's God in you living a Christian Life it's not you overcoming it's God in you overcome the life of the seed being expressed I've ever given everything transforming power to make out of itself in its potentials now to make out of itself exactly what I want it to be praise God let's turn to First Corinthians chapter 2 together read the scripture First Corinthians chapter 2. I hope we can get to the place as children of God till we're no longer basing our conduct on what people will think of us or what they will see and no longer basing our conduct on regulations and rules but that will begin to base our conduct on a free choice of that won't help me reach my potential that will harm the life that God's calling for that will stunt growth that will weaken the plan you see what I'm saying that won't be the proper expression of this life that the revelation of who we are amen brings the conduct in line not the fear of what somebody thinks but the revelation of Who We Are and then nobody has to watch you nobody has to follow you around nobody has to watch you nobody has to check on you nobody has to grab your phone and see what you've been looking at because you know that God put me here to manifest his life and he put within me everything that he wants to manifest and if I stay in the right atmosphere under the Holy Ghost under the word it'll pull out all that potentials and those things will hinder growth not help growth I'm not doing it those things will manifest the wrong life I can't I can't help somebody if I'm manifesting the wrong life if I'm claiming to be Christ and I'm showing something worldly in my attire in my dress my conduct my speech I'm hindering somebody else I'm not doing that because I know who I am not because somebody at church is going to no because I know who I am I'm not going to do that I I you know we've been together for a while now and you know me I I am not into loose living one drop but I believe the Revelation brings you to a higher life than you've ever been able to live before Holier cleaner amen because you because you understand who you are and God is giving strength from the seed to overcome and we're making those choices to keep strong not to weaken ourselves amen so First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 6. albeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery and darkness we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world and to our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the Deep things of God there are deep mysteries of God but we don't get them intellectually the spirit searches them out and brings them by revelation the spirit searches all things hey the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man say the spirit of a man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned God is bringing his word not to strike your head but to strike your soul comparing spiritual things with spiritual things Amen to bring you to a revelation and listen it's not just um it's not just God trying to bring you to a revelation of a Doctrine I hope we've grown past that God's not just trying to bring you to a revelation of a Doctrine but he's trying to bring you to the revelation of Who You Are this message came this message that this is just me now this is my synopsis and I know that if you make a synopsis you leave so much out and you can't minimalize stuff I understand that but just if I could from from what's in my heart just a synopsis I God didn't want me just to understand Doctrine because I could understand what happened in the garden and I could understand why it had to be blood at Calvary and I could understand why we baptized in Jesus name and all of that and at the end of all of my understanding I still don't know who I am what good was my understanding if I can go toe-to-toe with theologians and I can show scriptures and but I still don't know who I am what good did it do me the message didn't come to make us theologians although there's so much correct teaching and information amen there's so much correct teaching and understanding and there's nothing wrong with any of it but all the teaching is trying to get us to see the picture and if we miss the picture what good are the details the picture is Christ is the mystery of God revealed in this Bible is Christ and it was sealed up in darkness because of a lack of revelation of understanding what the real story within all the stories really was but in the end time God wanted to peel the seals off of this book to bring a revelation so that we could see something nobody else has ever seen before in the Bible so that we can see the real story of the Bible which is Christ male and female God redeeming his family becoming a family and living with his family on the Earth serpent seed helps me understand why I'm struggling in the flesh so that I can understand myself all the revelations are trying to get us to understand who we are and what the mystery that laid in the back part of God's mind was do you know what the back part of God's mind is it it is Darkness I can say because nobody's been able to see into it before it was shrouded in darkness amen this Bible has been the the truth of the word has been laying in the shadows foreign but in the end time he brings a light to reveal what's in the shadows he takes the seals off to show what's been what's been behind the cloud what's been in the darkness of the back part of his mind oh praise be to God I hope I hope that this can hit home amen it's more than Doctrine it's more than regulated it's it's it's God trying to get us to understand who we are because everything we do is based on what we believe you can see people's conduct all the time amen they claim to have tremendous Faith but anything goes wrong amen they lose it I mean they fall apart they need everybody in the world to pray for them amen they don't know if they're going to make it through and but you said you had tremendous faith then why at the first bump you you completely lose it amen God wants us to have real faith genuine Faith by coming into the revelation of who we really are who we really are amen amen I'm just going to go to a couple more places and then we'll we'll wind down first Thessalonians 5 4 believe Brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of Darkness I was born in a dark condition but I am a child of light by predestination if my father is light we've been through this before if light has Offspring they must be light if he is light his children will be light if he is love his children will be loved that's what God wants us to be amen Daniel says after he gets the revelation of the dream of Nebuchadnezzar he says then was the secret revealed unto Daniel and a night vision then Daniel blessed the god of Heaven Daniel answered and said blessed be the name of God forever and ever for wisdom and might are his and he changes the times and the seasons he removeth Kings instead of up Kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that no understanding he revealeth the deep and secret things he knows what is in the darkness and the light dwelleth with him Revelations 10 we're not going to go there and read all of it we've read it over and over you know Revelation 10 1-7 but in Revelation 10 1-7 there's something that's left in darkness and that's the seven Thunders John heard seven Thunders utter their voices and he was picking up his pen to write and he heard a voice from heaven and said write not the thing that the seven Thunders uttered but seal them up what does that mean something in Revelations 10 is shrouded in darkness it's laying in darkness it's laying in the back part of God's mind amen it's a mystery that needs to be revealed amen and it's it's in darkness where does God dwell in the thick Darkness is that what Solomon said he dwells in the thick Darkness the thick Darkness so thick you can't see into it so thick no Theologian no minister no church age messenger so thick nobody's been able to see that before but God is going to peel back the darkness he's going to show that the light is in the Darkness the light of this age is in the darkness of Revelation 10. the unwritten part of the word has the light that we need to overcome in this day and the message it is the rising of the Sun brother Brandon was talking about Junior Jackson's dream and in junior Jackson's dream he sees a great pyramid with with writing all around the outside of the pyramid and brother Branham means walking around the pyramid and he's interpreting the writing on the outside of the pyramid and so I'm going back because you guys are reading cheaters cheaters cheaters we need to pray he's walking around this pyramid interpreting the writing and this is Brother Brennan tying together all the Loose Ends restoring all the Lost doctrines that were lost to the church ages bringing us back Amen to the to the apostolic teaching and he goes around and after he's done going around interpreting all the writing on the outside that's what you could read does that make sense that was the writing on the outside Brother Bear talks about seal Seven Seals on the inside seals on the back side of the book and it can get super confusing if we don't just catch the big picture because the big picture's simple amen the terminology you can go is it inside is an outside backside front side west side what brother Branham is saying is there was some seals that was open in the book and they opened in symbol form when the lamb took the book and opened the seals and a white horse went riding that was an open seal you could read it and see it but there were seven other seals which was the mystery of the seven Thunders that John was told not to write and see a love that's the seals on the inside of the backside or whatever side brother Benham uses at that time he's showing that there's other parts of this mystery that have not been revealed yet and so he goes what what you can read he goes around and begins to interpret all the writing and restores the doctrine of serpent seed and the godhead and water baptism and predestination and all of these things he brings back the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and all of these things but then in the dream it says then you picked up something like from the air something like a Wrecking Bar crowbar wasn't it brother something like that A Wrecking Bar real sharp said how it done and I don't know it said you struck the top of the mountain ripped it around lifted the capital off and it was the shape of a pyramid and you rip the top of it off now that was months and months before the pyramid message was preached and said beneath that was White Stone Granite and you said the Sun or the light has never shined on this before it's part of the Bible that's never seen the light of day it's been in darkness on the inside of the pyramid which is the word amen inside this word something was in darkness brother Chad how can you say a thing like that it's the Bible Hey listen when it's not revealed it's dark to you it's still in darkness when you can't see it it's still in darkness It's Shouting the darkness it's laying right there amen remember when brother Branham said somebody told him amen you could write another book of the Bible or you can give us the interpretation of seven Thunder he said no I can't you can't add one word or take one word away it's got to be something that's already written here but if it's something that's written here already but brother Branham didn't know what it was then it was shrouded to him he was in darkness to what the Revelation was and tell the angel Lord came day by day and gave him the Revelation then he peeled back sealed by Seal and opened it up so that he could see so that word wasn't something added it was something laying there in the Darkness in our Bibles that's why printing billions of Bibles is not going to change the world Amen because this is the season for the unveiling of the written word praise God that's why Bible school won't do us any good because it can't reveal to you what was in the mountain it can't reveal to you the part that light has never shined on this part before and the sign of the inserts he says and look and he said look upon this light has never come upon it before this part White Stone granted with no writing on it why is there no writing on the stone it's a revelation that's contained within the mountain there's no writing on the stone but no light has never ever shined on this before but it's going to give you a revelation what is the Revelation listen you can't write anything on the stone whatever is written has to be written on the outside of the stone but not revealed till the Top's taken off and then when light shines on this it's aha I understand he said and remember their third pool was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word what was it it was in darkness laying there in Revelations 10 1. it was in darkness but it had already been written but no light had ever shown on this Revelation before but God used the prophet Amen to take the Capstone off to show us amen that that there's a mystery laying in this word amen this great mystery is the greatest of mysteries it's Revelation 10 7. it's the mystery of God all through this Bible God was coming God was manifesting God was revealing and he was coming through the prophets and he was coming through the patriarch he was coming through the law until he came as Jesus Christ and he was all the prophets and all the laws and all the Psalms and it was all of it together amen what is it it's the Great White Stone in the middle of this book it's all about him coming the seventh seal and he came as a man amen and that man was the last Adam to restore all that Adam lost and that last Adam was going to have a bride just like the first one had a bride but that bride had to come out of himself amen where do you get this brother Ted it's in the white stone inside the Bible where do you feel so I find that written I find they're written in Genesis chapter 2. I find it written in Genesis chapter 3. I find it written on the outside but the revelations on the inside and until this day light has never shined upon this before and through the New Testament he was coming he was coming snitting off the original coming building a bride until he brings a statue of a bride in the end time through and elect people upon the Earth to manifest bride and unite The Head and the body together as one to finish the work of redemption to manifest himself in Bride form a perfect bride perfectly submitted to the headship to finish the work he left for this day so that God can prove bruise Satan under your feet to finish the prophecy of Revelation or Genesis 3 thy see shall bruise his head he's going to finish it through bride and then when he's finished it he's going to pluck her away to a married supper we finished Redeeming the Jews burn the Earth and bring us back to an eating condition what is that brother Chad that's the great mystery of God that Christ is the mystery of God and Christ is revealing himself as the manifested word for the day in that revelation shows you who you really are that Revelation come at this end time take away doubts not to create doubts this message I I hope to God that God will help me never to preach it in such a way that it creates doubt because this message is supposed to take away doubt I mean we as human beings we can't always keep it straight so I pray God forgives me but I believe the heart of the message is come to identify a bride because that Prophet was here to point to a word born bride and she will be pointed to the skies by the same Prophet at the coming of the Lord and say Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world and he brings the two together so that we don't have to walk around and say which interpretation is Right which scripture is right when is it the Catholic is the Baptist is this what do I have to do to earn it and what steps do I have to take amen the only thing you have to do is come to the revelation of this hour and say son germanized bring life out of the seed I'm here Lord I recognize this is it this is the light this is everything and I believe by faith that inside of me is that seed Lord I'm just laying here and I'm letting you do what you promised take away fear take away scare take away all the Ridiculousness of trying human efforts and just stay in the Revelation and let the Revelation produce what it was always intended to produce a bride of Jesus Christ trust in him who trusts the word and is confident if she stays in the channel he will do all the work he will do all the work where will he do it he'll do it through you but you won't do it he'll do it you just surrender and he'll come and do it amen what a trust we can have Amen brother Ben said that's the day we're living in right now the light will shine just at the evening when the darkness is setting in you know Darkness creeped in to God's Eden but now in Satan's Eden when the world's in total chaos and darkness who believes the world's in complete darkness do you do you still believe God dwells in the midst of the darkness this world is in darkness religious Darkness but he still dwells in the thick Darkness because he's living in a bride in his body in a people in Satan's Eden brother Ben says in power to transform it's all wrong not people it's the program that's wrong and now what's it done it's all headed up again and brought the whole entire world through a bunch of hybriding perversion of the Original Seed of God to another darkened chaos but I'm so glad that God is mindful of us again that he can still move upon the face of the condition he goes right back to Genesis 1 2. he promised he would do it and call a little flock which would be his bride hey there's Darkness over the face of the Earth but the Holy Ghost is still brooding to bring those seeds up out of the darkness this is a familiar scripture out of Colossians 1 even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known was The Riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory Glory the Easter seal at the beginning broke the Seal of the Roman seal the Easter seal that he was sealed up and man when they died was gone but he broke the seal and revealed the secret and now God by his holy spirit has broke the seal from around our lives and Christ is revealed as he lives in US for now we are quickened with him everyone says in things that are to be now if we are those attributes of God we cannot live by Creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a Creed or a denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God and the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living where was that brother Chad that was what was revealed in the Rock in the rock the word within the word the great darkness in that darkness that unrevealed part of the word in that Darkness and now God has peeled away the darkness and he's shining that light amen not everybody sees it in light to some it's still Darkness you tell them about the bride coming of Christ and who this is and where Christ is in this day amen and who is United himself with it's still Darkness because all they see is people from Nazareth they still see people from Nazareth or maybe worse people from Lima it may have a worse reputation I don't know all they see is people with Lima amen they they see Darkness but in the darkness is God finishing his word finishing his work if we could approach unto the darkness we could find God and not run away and not be afraid but approach unto the thick Darkness that's you're just human beings how could you be a select elect group of people how could you be Christ how could Christ be living you you're just normal and you were born like I was born you work where I work and you it's say listen that's thick Darkness get beyond the thick Darkness don't be afraid of the thick Darkness that's just my old cockoverness that's just my old hybrid amen but down inside is another life it's Christ Living himself out it's the revelation of the hour brother Venom he showed a picture of a cloud that cloud is Darkness to some but to me it's light to some that's a great mystery that's still mysterious and still scary to talk about scary to recognize the implications of what that means but brother Branham one time in the service took that took that picture of a cloud and he turned it to the right and he said that's our Lord up there showing that the Lord had returned to unite with his bride the church you know what to some that's still shrouded in darkness the seven steel is still a mystery but to me it's light it's not anything to run away from it's not anything to move off the mountain from but God Amen was thundering from this mountain with this great Revelation and it's so mysterious and it it's so overwhelming to think that that's actually true that it looks so impossible and so dark with Thunders and Lightnings and flashes of light and thick Darkness amen that everybody runs away but there was a predestinated one in that day that didn't run away he went into what was scary and by the grace of God he has put something in us that can move into what scares away millions of people and what did we find behind all the scare we found the light the Revelation the reality of the word where was it it was shrouded in the confusion around the seventh seal and the confusion around the coming of the Lord and the confusion around all this there was such Darkness such such fear so many would run away amen but by the grace of God he pulled us and he pulled us and he pulled us and when we broke into the darkness we found this is light for he dwells in the thick we don't want to be afraid of the revelation of the hour we want to move in up and in brother Brown says in things that are to be so now the only way that you can be a son or a daughter of God because you have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life so you have to have eternal life and there's only one form that's God's life so what's in you God's life see how this Revelation is to take away all the scare how can you say I hope I make the Rapture how can you say I hope to make the Rapture if you have a revelation your bride if you have a revelation your bride you can't miss the Rapture amen just like our brother rashan said you are the rapture the Rapture is taking place in you now as it's lifted you out of denominationalism and Rose to church out of deadness and brought it back to life to its original condition so the rapture's going on in you how can you miss the rapture so you see we sabotage ourselves by things that come out of our mouth amen the Revelation if you're a bride if there's only one form of eternal life that's God and that's the life that's in you then God is in you how are you going to fail how are you gonna miss the Rapture how are you going to be deceived how are you not going to make it how are you going to not know you may not know everything now and you may not know the hour the next event will transpire you may not have intellectual understanding but the god that's in you will lead you all the way that life that's in you was meant to overcome in this age and to flourish and to manifest in this hour you're not going to miss it you're not going to be left behind you're not going to be confused you're not going to be deceived God is going to manifest himself through these seeds so he goes on to say they're there to be a Son of God you had to be in him always and the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as the son of God you see how the message was not here to bring form and ritual the message is not here to bring scare the message is not here to bring confusion the message is here to bring a life it says now I want to read that last sentence again and you're nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a Son of God and now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age what are you to do light up this age what age is it the darkest age there's ever been is shining the brightest lights there's a light in this present darkness and it's shining through the manifested word for the day which is the Bride of Jesus Christ now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age you're expressing God's life in you because you are a son or daughter of God therefore you get what I mean see you are now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation and this people in this neighborhood where you associate wherever you are God knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you ever if you've got eternal life then it was always was eternal life and gone before there was a foundation of the world knew that you would be here and when the word or the water the washing of the water of the word fell upon you it was expressed in a being and that is who I am oh the Chad Lamb that was so many years ago he was a rascal born wrong born through sex desire coming to the world speaking lies shrouded in darkness overshadowed by death all of those things but praise God I'm not identifying with that one I'm identifying with the original that God thought God had of me before the foundation in the world and that's the seed down on the inside and that's who I really am and all the potential is already there if I can just stay in the channel it'll come out and let's all stand musicians if you'll come please Jesus said I'm the light of the world he that hath me who no longer walk in darkness for us the darkness is faded away this world is shrouded in darkness laodicea is gone and laodicea has gone into a total blackout complete apostasy but to me it's the rising of the Sun it's a bright shiny day it's shalom it's good morning it's praise God the darkness upon the Earth but light has sprung amen let me read this last scripture in Isaiah 61-3 arise Shine for thy lightest come and the Lord glory of the Lord has risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth in Gross Darkness to people but the Lord shall arise upon thee in his glory shall be seen upon thee and the Gentile shall come to thy light and Kings to the brightness of Rising it is the rising of the Sun God bless you all amen you have a song brother hell walking in the light it's such a beauty foreign [Music] [Music] oh it shines all around [Music] one more time [Music] the new foreign [Music] [Music] T Shepard turned in a prayer request this morning for his wife who's in ICU her name's Melissa Melissa requested that we that a prayer cloth be brought to her so we have a cloth here I've wore it with me while I was preaching and I'm going to pray for it I'm going to ask that we all bow our heads together we'll pray as we thank God for the word and we'll ask God to bless our sister's Faith she has faith in the word of God and she has faith in Acts 19 because this is the scripture brother Ben quoted over and over when he sent out prayer Clause Acts 19 12 so that from his body we're brought into the sick handkerchiefs and aprons and the diseases departed from them and evil spirits went out of them we believe if we come by the same faith that Melissa's already expressed her faith in this scripture by asking for a prayer call if we can agree with her in faith we believe God will keep an honor his word and honor her faith so let's bow our heads together dear heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus for this word that you have given us Lord God it's so amazing what you have done in our day I don't believe we've fully grasped the fool scope of what you have done in this generation Lord when you when you revealed the hidden Mystery when you revealed the great mystery that you had in the back part of your mind and unfolded it into three folds brother you would send the man from Kentucky with a seventh grade education and no theology look to others like Darkness but to us when we approached unto that we found the life we found the true Revelation on the word the great mystery you had in the back part of your mind this message that has scared so many people Lord to us it's light it's no longer Darkness or a scary thing but it's light Lord It's the illumination that we need to walk in this hour oh God we're so thankful that you put a seed inside of us that could receive your word so thankful that you brewed it over Us by the Holy Ghost to bring the light to us Quicken us to life well we could have never done this on our own but you did it for us and God we're thankful I pray Lord that the word that was preached would strike the hearts of your children and bring forth a Bountiful Harvest may we God move away Lord from all the things that deter us and distract us and hurt us may we stay Lord in the channel that brings Greater Life may we rely Lord on your word and the promise in your word and may it bring out of us all the potentials that lay inside your seed God I pray to go with your people as we part icularly we want to agree together for the healing of our sister Melissa Shepherd God she had faith in your word to ask and request Lord that that fabric we brought to her that a piece of garment just like they brought from the body of Paul Lord I've wore this on my person while I preached your gospel under your anointing well we're we're living in the scriptures we want to see them alive all around us God I pray that you would honor our sisters Faith as we stand with our agreement that Lord when this cloth comes to her that the sicknesses the diseases will depart in evil spirits will leave may you heal her may we hear the testimony of her healing Lord we love you and we thank you for the promises you've given us in your word may you go with us this day and may we be light in the Darkness and the Darkness of Satan's eating in the darkness of laodicea may we be bright in shining lights we love you God and we ask for your help as we surrender to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen God bless you all thank you so much it's really been well I want God's way to be my way as I Journey [Music] for there is
