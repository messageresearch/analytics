could take your bibles and turn to genesis chapter 2 with me and i'd like to make a real quick announcement i made an announcement on wednesday but we had no picture but i'd like to show you the picture of brother luke and sister ariel hatfield's little baby vivian grace you meant she was born on wednesday and uh we thank god for her and uh they had a little bit of a trial you know after she was born um her uh blood glucose levels went down a little bit so they wanted to give her an iv and then they took the regular battery of tests the blood work and her white blood cell count came back a little bit high so they wanted to do a battery of tests to make sure she didn't have an affection so they started her on an iv she had to go to the special care nursery and get on antibiotics and and it was a i'm sure quite a trying time for sister ariel and brother luke but by the grace of god brother luke called me just a few minutes ago and he says she's fine and we're taking her home today amen praise be to god so we thank god for that we sure been praying for them and all the tests came back negative she never had an affection she was fine there's nothing wrong with her she's perfectly healthy praise god amen so we're happy for them and they're going home uh sometime right now you know they're being discharged so uh keep them in your prayers and we thank god for that also the information for thomas sproul's junior funeral is on the bulletin boards also the goat fund me information's on there if you'd like to contribute to that to help them out at this time also i'd like to welcome paul uh brother paul and sister ursula god bless you they're back here on the right many of you remember brother paul says to ursula as they were here and fellowship with us for a while but work took him away he's been gone for quite some time but by the leading of the lord god's directed him back and they're moving back here to be part of us and the fellowship with this so we want to welcome them so they've got they've brought a load of stuff this weekend they've got to turn around and go back home tomorrow to finish up wrapping up some things there so pray for them and they should be back in a few weeks so god bless you welcome we love you and we had a little bit of fellowship the other day and it was nice so it's good to see you all again amen while we're standing let's turn in our bibles to genesis 2 and we'll begin reading in verse 8. genesis chapter 2 and verse 8 and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed man god bless you as you're seated may the lord bless the reading of his word amen it's interesting i've been doing some studying on a subject and i just took for a title mercy and judgment at the threshing floor mercy and judgment at the threshing floor and i'd preached a message on the threshing floor some time ago and i was just meditating on that or i've come across something else that i was looking at it reminded me of that but i started looking at some things the lord is bringing to my attention it's amazing the themes that run through the bible they're absolutely astounding and this one you know here we are at the very beginning of the book and god has given us for him to reveal himself to us that we call this book we call the bible we know it's a record of the book of redemption and we know it's also a copy of the marriage certificate it's all of these things but this in this book of redemption he starts off by planting a garden and this theme of gardening husbandry fruit production wheat all of this goes all the way through the bible in fact it's a consistent major theme all the way through the bible and i think we'll find as we look at that it it it is the theme really and so he started off by planting a garden eastward in eden and he put the man in his garden amen and so it's just it's fascinating i want to look at that and start from there and keep moving let's go to isaiah 61. isaiah 61. and we're going to read from verse 1 isaiah 61 and verse 1. amen keep your bibles handed we're going to read through quite a few scriptures today and will take this i believe in the form of a bible study i for the last several days have been studying the bible and enjoying it so much i was telling brother jeremy he come around back and i said i was so much enjoying studying the bible tracing these things through the scriptures and reading the bible that i was just pulling together bible verses and all of a sudden i went into panic mode last night this morning thinking i've got to preach this like i i'm just enjoying collecting the verses and having my own private bible study and so i said god help me however it comes out is how it comes out amen but i was getting lost in the in the in the bible study isaiah 61 1 the spirit of the lord is upon me because the lord has anointed me to preach good tidings into the meek he has sent me to bind up the broken hearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord we know that when jesus took the scroll and began to read it he stopped here at this comma because he was proclaiming the acceptable year of the lord but we know that the the scripture and the prophecy has to be completed has to finish and we know that we're in the day of the completion of this scripture and it goes on to say in the day of the vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn so we've come to the day of the vengeance of our god we've come into a cycle of judgment amen where god is now judging the earth but he's come also to comfort all that mourn it says to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified so we see what he's coming to in the end when he wraps it all up he is uh he's going to heal zion which is a type of the bride and he's going to appoint them amen they're going to be called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord because we know that god is a gardener is that right he's playing in a garden eastward in eden god is a gardener and god has been sowing seed been planting amen and what he's been looking for is fruit for seed for grain amen to come back to him from his garden and in the end these are going to be the trees of the lord the the trees of righteousness the planting of the lord amen i saw that brother nate was doing a bible study on trees of the bible and i was really blessed by that because it was the same thing i was looking at that happens a lot so praise god let's look at john chapter 19 now and go over to john 19. i just want to catch a few scriptures in a way of a theme john chapter 19 verse 41. this is we're dealing with the crucifixion of christ and here we come the chapter 19 verse 41 now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden it's amazing how often this pops up and the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden of new sepulcher wherein was never a man yet laid and there laid they jesus therefore because of the jews preparation day for the sepulcher was nigh at hand so jesus the body of christ was planted in a garden amen let's go to chapter 20 verse 11. we know this is resurrection mourning now but mary stood without the sepulcher weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of jesus had lain and they say unto her woman why weep us down she saith unto them because they have taken away my lord and i know not where they have laid him and when she when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus and and jesus saith unto her woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou she supposing him to be the gardener amen she's supposing him to be the gardener sayeth unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou has laid him and i will take him away jesus saith unto her mary she turned herself and saith in him rabboni which is to say master. so here we find on the on the day of the crucifixion amen they took jesus and uh the body of christ and they laid him in a garden tomb they buried him in the garden amen and we know within three days that he resurrected and and so that seed came forth in life and he resurrected and now we know that he appeared a few times in different forms unto those we know that he appeared in a different form to those who were walking on the road to emmaus but here he appears to mary in a form and he's speaking to mary and mary doesn't recognize him and and mary knew what jesus looked like there's no question that she knew his face she knew what he looked like amen but he appears to her in a form and she doesn't recognize him in this form but she assumes he's the gardener and you wonder why did she assume he's the gardener that he had gardening tools did he have a gardening garb i don't know but she assumed him to be the gardener amen showing that jesus christ was buried as the seed but he raised as the gardener because god is the great gardener amen now he's not just the seed but he he's proving i'm not just a seed but i'm the gardener amen i'm the one amen i'm the one who planted the garden eastward in eden amen not just the seed that was planted but i'm also the one planting the seed i mean these themes run all the way through the scripture amen you see even even when you look at the constellation you know brother branham says that god wrote his first bible in the stars and if you look at the constellation of virgo which is the virgin amen the ancients would draw a depiction they would draw a picture amen and the stars don't actually make that picture you can't have you ever looked at the stars and you'd be like that's what now i because the stars don't actually make that picture but when the ancients would draw in a star diagram they would draw a picture and there would be key stars within that constellation and the names of the stars would tell the story of the constellation amen so in the in the constellation of virgo amen they draw a woman and then she's she's either standing or she's seated amen and they draw the ancient greeks drew a woman that was was holding in her hand a sheaf of wheat and and the name of the star that's in her hand in the constellation is the brightest star in the constellation it's one of the brightest stars in the night sky and the name of that star is spica and spica in latin means the head of grain amen so what did the woman have it was the seed of the woman amen it was what was christ amen the christ child was the seed of the woman that was promised all the way back in genesis chapter 3 at the time of the curse was promised there would come a seed of the woman so in virgo the virgin the brightest star that's in her hand amen is spica and in in in i think it's the egyptian show as a child sitting in her hand a baby sitting in her hand i mean the greeks show it as a sheaf of wheat the latin word spica means the head of grain he is the seed of the woman amen he is the planting he is the grain he had to die and be planted because amen if he if he abides amen he'll bite alone but if he be planting and die and go into the ground he'll come back many fold amen so the seed was planted so that he could come back a mini-membered body amen as his church as the bride of jesus christ so everything's telling the same story of gardening and planting and vineyards and wheat and barley and all this runs through the bible and as we look at the bible it's so easy to get caught up in the the black marks on white paper and the individual verses and the separated books and we can get down into the the details and mull around and miss the picture amen but sometimes god is so good to us that he allows us to catch these themes through the scripture and when you see the theme moving through you back off and you don't no longer look at the bible as 66 separate books you don't look at it as a number of verses and a compilation of writings of men but you begin to see that this is a story this is a drama this is the unveiling of god it's the unfolding of his plan it's what was in his mind from before the foundation of the world and what he had in his mind was to plant his seed and his seed to produce multiple seed amen that's what god's been wanting to do all along praise be to god let's go to matthew chapter 13. we're going a long way to get to the subject title but praise god anyhow just keep smiling and nodding your head be nice to me and we'll keep pulling and we'll just trust god to bring us into the revelation that he has for us matthew 13 verse 24 another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened to a man which soweth good seed in this field but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also so the servants of the householder came and said unto him sir this thou not sow good seed in thy field from winston have it tears he said unto them an enemy hath done this the servant said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while ye gather up the tares you root up also the wheat with them let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest i will say to the reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn amen this word barn is also the word for garner which is also the word that this word barn can be is the same word that's translated threshing floor so bring the bring the bundles into the the threshing floor into the garner and the threshing floor is always the final stop before gathering into the garner because there's a final place of separation where the wheat is separated from the hull and the shuck and the dust and the stalk and all of that so so he begins to share this parable and the parable is about the kingdom of god but it shows the sowing of two seeds you catch that sowing of a seed first of wheat and a proper grain then sowing another seed of tares of weeds and then they must grow together all the way through down through time but in the time of harvest there'll be a separation so now let's go over and look at the explanation he gives of this in verse 36 then jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man so now we're going to see that the son of man is a farmer he's a gardener he's the husbandman he that soweth the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one right here jesus is explaining the condition of the world going all the way back to eden when two seeds were sown one was sown by the son of man one was sown by the wicked one and then there was going to be the the the grain the seed the wheat the the genuine that god wanted but mingled in amongst it was sowed of the wicked one other seed that he would call tares and they would be mingled together until the end time but in the end time they would be separated out and he said the tares are the children of the wicked one verse 39 the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend in them which do iniquity and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the son and the kingdom of their father who hath ears to hear let him hear so this is one of the parables of the kingdom the kingdom of god and revealing one of the mysteries of the kingdom of god and that mystery is that the son of man sowed a seed and the wicked one sowed a seed and they mingled together and could not be separated until the end time but the end time he was going to send his angels and angels just mean messenger so don't don't don't look at this the wrong way he sent seven messengers to seven church ages and he's been separating out amen and they're going to be bound in the end time and burnt in fire there's going to come a final separation so part of the process of sowing seed amen comes to the harvest time and the harvest time is a time of separation amen things can get mingled weeds can come in uh the wrong seed can be sown in the field but it's left until the end time and in the end time amen there's going to be a separation because when he sowed the seed what he wanted was grain and he's going to have what he wanted because god is a husbandman god is a farmer god is a gardener amen so the the the part that i want to look at today is the part of separation and and he says uh he says that they'll send angels and they'll bind up the tares so in the time of of of the harvesting of the wheat amen they will the the the reapers who are harvesting the wheat they will be bundling the wheat together in sheaves to take to the threshing floor but they will also be gathering the tears in the wheat and binding them together and setting them aside for burning so there's a separation that takes place in the field but there's a further separation that takes place on the threshing floor and so on the threshing floor now the wheat plant comes into the threshing floor without the tares and in the threshing floor amen there's more separation so there's a separation in the field amen and then there's a separation at the threshing floor now remember that they were separate to start with when the son of man sowed the children of the kingdom into the world amen they were already separate from the tares they were already separate from the world they were already separated out so when we go through this process all it is is god taking back what was his originally amen god bringing it back to original condition originally it was separated originally it was seed it was wheat it was pure it was undefiled it wasn't mingled with anything it didn't have any of the world attached to it amen it was pure seed then it comes into the world to go through a growing process and through the growing process there's a mingling there's an attachment with the world there's all of these things that take place but the harvest time is going to be a time of separation separating the tares and the wheat in the field but then a further separation on the threshing floor so that when he gathers back into his garner he has again just his wheat just his children just his seed praise god amen so we we look at these things and it seems like a harsh process when you look at separation uh in the field and burning and thrashing and and all of these things but when you when you get down to the end of it it's a perfectly righteous act amen because he's taking back what was his originally the tares weren't his amen they were never his amen what does he want he wants his seed back he wants the seed that he intended that went through the growing process and after it's grown and developed and went through the stages of growth he's bringing it back into his garner he wants his seed back so this this uh there's a scripture another scripture i want to get to here let me find it i might just reference it if i can't find it yeah i'll just reference it i might come across it later but you know where uh no here it is i'm sorry uh let's go to matthew chapter 9. matthew chapter 9 verse 37. he says then saith he unto his disciples the harvest is truly plenteous but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he shall send forth laborers into his harvest jesus was looking out all the people and he and he saw the people scattered as sheep with no shepherd and he had compassion on them and he says and to his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few pray to the lord of the harvest and he was the lord of the harvest he was the one declaring it was ready to reap he was the lord of the harvest so we know that he is the the gardener he is the seed sower because the one that sowed the seed was the son of man he's the lord of the harvest amen he's the head of the reapers he's all of these things and it's all about grain it's all about seed and he says pray therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send laborers into the harvest amen because there's got to be laborers that go in to pull out the wheat amen to separate out the wheat and that's what's been going on for 2 000 years amen and still we pray going on today that there's seed out there to be gathered amen to be brought out and let's go back to matthew chapter 3 now so we talked about the separation in the field of the wheat and the tares and now we want to look at something john the baptist said uh matthew chapter 3 verse 11 said i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire so he's talking about the one who's mightier than i so he's speaking of jesus christ he's going to have a baptism of fire but then he describes him this way his fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his floor this word floor is the threshing floor he will thoroughly purge his floor so when it says his fan is in his hand it's not and we talked about this several years ago when we preached on it it's not a fan like we think of a fan but this fan is a winnowing fork and a winnowing fork is is an instrument as a tool amen they use at the harvest time the winnowing fork it would be almost like a rake for us only it works and backwards instead of raking something to you you put the winnowing forks underneath amen the the straw and the shaft and everything that's together and you throw it up in the air and as you throw it up in the air amen the wind blows away the chaff and the dust and all these things and the and the seed falls back upon the threshing floor amen and throughout this process of separating amen the shaft and the stalk and the dirt and all of these things from the wheat amen there's several things that they do they can flail the wheat i mean they have a stick with a piece of leather with a second stick they can beat it so there's beating so they take the sheaves where the end of the head of the sheath with the straw and the shuck and all of that comes out of the field they lay it down they beat it they trodden over it with ox amen they pull a sledge over it amen which is a as a wooden sledge that people ride on to to tear apart amen and separate the grain from the shuck and and the stalk then they and they they have oxen walk on it they have people walk on it they all kind it's trodden upon it's beaten amen it's torn us underne and then they come with the winnowing fork when the wind is blowing and they the fan is the winnowing fork and this fan is in his hand and he grabs a clump up and he tosses it up in the air amen and it gets tossed all about amen but the winds the winds that are blowing are moving away everything that's not seed amen but the seed remains on the threshing floor so everything gets tossed about amen and you wonder you know why why seemingly is it that i go through the same things the the unbeliever goes through i go through the same things the rest of the world i get sicknesses my car breaks down i have issues i i lost my job i did this i did that amen because you've got to go through through the winnowing process through the through the threshing process amen but what god is doing through the threshing process is he's getting the wheat amen separated from everything that's not life-carrying seed everything that's not original word original seed the original thought of god the original planting when he planted it first amen everything that's not original has to be separated off of this seed before he can gather it into his barn amen so the process is brutal the process is grueling amen the chaff gets tossed with the wheat the wheat gets trodden with the stalk amen they're all going through the same process amen but this process moves away stock it moves away chaff it moves away dust but it never blows away the seed amen that never moves god's original thought not god's original word god's original intent will always fall back on the threshing floor again so he will thoroughly purge his floor that means everything that is not original word from the original thought of god the original seed of god is being purged off of his threshing floor see the separation in the field is a separation and it couldn't happen until harvest time because it was so intertwined that when you pluck up one you can pluck up the other before it's come to maturity but we're not in that stage of greenness now because we've come through the church ages and come to maturity where there's been a separation and the separation in the field continues but he's bringing that that's been separated in the field back to his threshing floor so that he can finish the process of separating everything off of us that is not his original idea and so chaff gets tossed you get tossed amen stalk gets tossed you get to and who's doing the tossing the lord of the harvest [Music] who who's throwing you in the air the lord of the harvest but he's trying to separate us from everything that's not the original life and so the process was for ordained of god he sowed the seed into the earth he knew it would go through the process the the the false seed was sown in amongst it the separation time has to come we're now in the end time the harvest time now the final separation is taking place where where this bride is being separated from everything that's not the word and i don't know what we expected but if we read the scriptures we would know what to expect we shouldn't expect it to be easy we shouldn't expect it to be simple amen the process that is explained to us in the scriptures amen is not a process that's simple or easy it's a process that's complicated and difficult and rough and tumultuous but at the end and i'll say like i've taught this before but every time it's tossed and trodden upon and tossed and trodden upon and flailed and all the things that the the harvest goes through every time it's tossed about and trodden again every cycle changes the concentration of seed with non-seed so when they first come into the threshing floor you have a lot more material that's not the seed than is the seed so the concentration of the seed amen is minimal in comparison to the volume that's on the threshing floor there's piles of sheaves all over the threshing floor but only a very small volume of that is seed it could be piled up to where the oxen is trotting upon it i mean it's going knee-deep with in in all of this uh material amen but as the process goes on more and more material is removed purged from the threshing floor amen but the one thing that's never perched on the threshing floor is the seed so it's purged away and purged away and purged away and through each cycle of purging through each cycle of tribulation through each cycle of troubles and testings amen there's there's more there's a greater concentration of original seed to that which is not original seed so why why is uh why do we keep having one trial after another trial after another trial amen because god wants to change the concentration in you amen he wants to get back to that original word a son of god in every way taking only the word not your ideas not the ideas of man not the concepts of laodicea but he's tossing us about and grinding us under to separate us from those things because he wants the concentration to come back to just word and word only just original and original only so it's not this this process is spelled out in the scriptures it's plain and we can see it in our lives and so we thank god for that it this these things that we go through it now this changes our perspective when we understand the word and what god is doing the parable of the kingdom all the sudden and unlocks so much and we understand now what my life is all about amen and we stop asking the questions of why is this happening to me and we start saying god what do you want me to do and how do you want me to act and what is it you're showing me amen no more why is this happening to me and this isn't fair and all of this nonsense that happened in our immaturity and our childish faith amen that should be going away amen because we're on the threshing floor being separated from the world carnality carnal ideas worldly thinking amen churchianity and denominational understanding is being pulled away from us and bringing us right back to the original thought of god we say thank god amen this process may be difficult but it's good amen this process may be inconvenient for my flesh but god is not after my flesh he's after my soul amen because that's where the seed is praise be to god he's got a solution for the flesh so i want to go back and look in the old testament a little bit if you can turn with me to first samuel and i want to take a little bit a look at the ark of the covenant and the threshing floor for just a few minutes because i really want to establish this principle through the scripture first samuel see if i can get there uh chapter six first samuel chapter six in verse 10. when we come to verse 10 we back up a little bit and know that uh that in the days of eli the high priest who was judge of israel the ark of the covenant was lost and it went to the philistines but it was too much for the philistines to handle they couldn't handle it amen they were having a lot of problems so they sent they were going to send the ark away from them so they they this is their plan to send it away they were going to get two uh milk cows that had young calves they were going to hold back the calves send it on a cart amen with gifts and send it away from them with the milk cows then the milk cows will always turn back to their calves because there's nobody to drive it they just sent it away and they said if it goes straight away and goes to israel then it was god bringing this plague upon us but if it turns back then it wasn't gone so they get the milk cows we're going to pick this up in verse 10 and the men did so and took two milk kind and tied them to the cart and shut up their calves at home and they laid the ark of the lord upon the cart and the coffer with the mice of gold and with the images of their emirates and the kind took the straight way to the way of beth shemesh it went straight they didn't turn to the side they didn't turn back home back to their cavs amen they went straight into israel straight to the to the uh israeli territory straight to the way to beth shemesh and went along the highway lowing as they went and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left and the lords of the philistines went after them into the border of beth shemesh and they of beth shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley i don't believe anything is by accident in the bible so now they have lost the word amen because the ark represented the word because the ten commandments the original ten commandments were in the ark amen and it represented the word which represented the presence of god when the ark left with the original covenant the presence of god left from israel amen but when the ark with the original covenant the original word came back in it was a return of the presence of the lord and so now the the word is coming back the presence of the lord the ark is coming back when at the time of wheat harvest amen at the time of wheat harvest so let me see read this again and they of beth shemesh verse 13 were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark and rejoiced to see it and the cart came into the field of joshua joshua was the old testament name for jesus jesus and joshua the same name so it came into the field of jesus joshua amen a beth shemite and beth beth shemesh means the house of son of the son the house of the son and stood there where there was a great stone and they claimed the wood of the cart and offered the kind and burnt offering unto the lord so here we see the philistines couldn't handle the word amen the presence of the lord was judgment upon them amen so the ark represented the presence of the lord because of the original word the original covenant they could not handle the presence of the lord the presence of the lord was judging them so they could not bear under the judgments they were breaking out and tumors and cancers and having all kinds of problems so they sent it away and in a supernatural way those milk kind they took them they took it right to israel but it come right at the time they were in the fields reaping the wheat harvest amen because at the time of wheat harvest which is the reaping of the gentiles amen the word is going to return into the land and with the word will come the presence of the lord and that's the day we live in it comes through the field of joshua in the house of the son praise be to god this is our day so let's move on then the the we know that in besha mesh they sin greatly against god that they looked into the ark and when they looked into the ark a plague broke out and killed many of them so they sent it away to another city which was a levite town and they put it under the care of levites and there it remained for 20 years until david would call it home to himself now when david took the kingdom when he took jerusalem amen he was he pitched a tent for the house of the lord and the city of david and he wants now the ark to come to him because david wants the presence of the lord with him in jerusalem david wants the covenant he wants the ark amen amen the philistines couldn't handle it it judged them he sent it away david wants it to come to him amen so david amen let's go let's look at this in second samuel let's just flip over here just a second samuel chapter six and we'll read it together so david sends a company after it they put it upon a new cart a new ox cart mean which we know is not the correct way it was supposed to be bore on the shoulders of the levites amens but but david is bringing it back with rejoicing they're excited the presence of the lord is coming back amen but they're not doing it according to the word they're doing according to their own understanding and then in second samuel 6 verse 6 and when they came to naked's threshing floor i want you to catch this the bible lists a very specific place that they came to when they were bringing it up amen from the city of the levites they were bringing it into the city of david and as they got to a very specific place along the journey when they got to this place which is naked's threshing floor ouza put forth his hand to the ark of god and took hold of it for the ox and shook it and this this word shook it means to fall or to fall over it was going to fall off of the cart and he reached up and he grabbed a hold of it where did god allow this to happen at a threshing floor and at the threshing floor amen the the ooze put forth his hand to the ark of god and took hold of it for the ox and shook him and the anger of the lord was kindled against us and god smote him there for his error and there he died by the ark of god amen he he was smitten dead amen where at the threshing floor not anywhere else along that journey not when they put it up on the on the ox card amen not as they come along amen but at at the threshing floor the auction shook amen it was going to spill over there at the threshing floor amen user was judged because he touched the ark amen and it was a judgment of god at the threshing floor because they were not doing it according to the word because everything must come back to the word amen not our ideas amen and it just shows the threshing floor is the place of separation and the place of separation is a place of judgment in the judgment place it's separated what is wheat and what is not wheat right so the threshing floor is a place of judgment and in that place of judgment the the wheat in everything that's not original wheat grain is separated out and here at the threshing floor the judgment of god strikes because it's a threshing floor these these things these aren't cute stories they're not interesting things they're a theme that god is laying down let's look at second samuel 24. we know that david eventually uh learns of his mistake his error he sends the levites they buried on the shoulders they bring it into the tabernacle that he pitched in the city of david um and so it go it goes thus far then we come to uh ii samuel 24 and i want to read verse 1 and again the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and he moved david against them to say go number israel and judah i want to spend a few minutes on this because it's very interesting to me the anger of the lord was kindled against israel israel had done something wrong and god was going to bring a judgment to them and it says that he moved david against him to say go number israel and judah but james 1 13 i'll just read you james 1 says let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death so james says let no man say when he's tempted i'm tempted of gone for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth thee any man but here in verse 1 it says the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and he moved david against them to say go number israel and judah so we get the rest of the story in first chronicles so let's go over the first chronicles and fill in the blanks first chronicles chapter 21 first chronicles chapter 21 verse 1 and satan stood up against israel and provoked david to number israel how did god move david he let the devil loose on him all right listen friends satan is not taking over god's kingdom satan is working to bring about god's plan god was angry against israel and he moved david how did he move david he unleashed the devil against him and the devil tempted him amen and it says and satan stood up against israel and provoked david to number israel david now was told not to number amen they were not to number themselves because it didn't matter how many they were god fought for them god was on their side they didn't need strength in numbers they needed strength in god amen and so they were never to number themselves and then david sends to number and james tells us amen we're enticed when we're led late let away of our own lust there was something david wanted to know in this numbering of the people he wanted to know how many people how much strength how big his army whatever it was he wanted to know he was enticed by his own lusts and it was the devil that was doing it not god but god allowed it amen so satan is just a tool that god is using to work out his plan and bring perfection and understanding and teaching to his children amen so praise be to god sometimes we get so mad at the devil amen but they had done something to provoke god and they needed to look at themselves you know and say god help me first chronicles 21 8. go to verse 8. and god and david said unto god i have sinned greatly because i have done this thing but now i beseech thee do away the iniquity of thy servant for i have done very foolishly and the lord spake unto god david see are saying go and tell david saying thus saith the lord i offer thee three things choose thee one of them that i may do it unto thee so god came to david and said unto him thus saith the lord choose thee either three years famine or three months to be destroyed before thy foes while that the sword of thine enemy overtake thee or else three days the sword of the lord even the pestilence in the land and the angel of the lord and the angel of the lord destroying throughout all the coast of israel now therefore advise thyself that what word i shall bring again to him that sent me and david said unto god i am in a great strait let me fall now into the hand of the lord for very great are his mercies but let me not fall into the hand of man. so the lord sent pestilence upon israel and there fell of israel seventy thousand men and god sent an angel into jerusalem to destroy it and as he was destroying the lord beheld and he repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed it is enough stay now thine hand and the angel of the lord stood by the threshing floor of ornan the jebusite here we have another threshing floor another seed of judgment another place of separation and as the angel of the lord was destroying through all the coast of israel when it comes to jerusalem and it comes to destroy in jerusalem god says stop because jerusalem is a type of the bride and god says stop and he repented himself of all his evil and he stopped and he says stay now thy hand and the angel of the lord stood by the threshing floor of ornon the jebusite listen he could have stood anywhere it's significant that god had him stop here verse 16 and david lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the lord stand between the earth and the heaven having a drawn sword and his hand stretched out over jerusalem then david and the elders of israel who were clothed in sackcloth fell upon their faces and david said unto god is it not i that commandeth the people to be numbered even i it is that has sinned and done evil indeed but as for these sheep what have they done let thine hand i pray thee o lord my god be on me in my father's house but not on thy people that they should be plagued then the angel of the lord commanded gad to say to david that david should go up and set up an altar unto the lord and the threshing floor of ornan the jebusite and david went up at the saying of god which was spoken thy name of the lord and ornan turned back and saw the angel and his four sons with him hid themselves now ornan was threshing wheat what time was it in the wheat harvest and the time of the wheat harvest while he was threshing wheat god comes to jerusalem for the destruction and he tells the angel stop and his sword is stretched over jerusalem but he says stop not here not now god extends mercy in the harvest time during the wheat threshing time he extends mercy and he says stop by the threshing floor of ornan where ornon was threshing his wheat do you see the theme are you catching it amen and he says and david came to ornon ornon looked and saw david and went out of the threshing floor and bound himself to david with his face to the ground then david said to oron grant me the place of this threshing floor that i may build an altar thereon unto the lord thou shalt grant me for the full price that the plague may be stayed from the people and ornan said unto david take it to thee and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes lo i give thee the oxen also for burnt offering and the threshing instruments for wood and the wheat for the weed offering i give it all and king david said to ornan nay but i will verily buy it for the full price for i will not take that which is dying for the lord nor offer burnt offerings without cost so david gave to ornan for the place 600 shekels of gold by weight and david built there an altar into the lord and offered burnt offering and peace offering and called upon the lord and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering and the lord commanded the angel and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof at the time when david saw the lord had answered him in the threshing floor of ornon the jebusite then he sacrificed there for the tabernacle of the lord which moses made in the wilderness and the altar of the burnt offering were at that season in the high place at gibeon and david could not go before it to inquire of god for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the lord chapter 22 verse 1 then david said this is the house of the lord god and this is the altar of the burnt offering for israel so now we see when he brings the ark up not according to the word amen uzza is smitten dead at a threshing floor amen now under another judgment for numbering the people amen the angel of the lord comes with a sword of pestilence throughout the coast amen any and they're dying amen there's a judgment there's a judgment time and it's a time of the wheat harvest during the threshing of wheat is also the time of the judgment amen and that's judgment goes so far but when he comes to jerusalem and the sort of stretch over jerusalem god says stop right there stop at the threshing floor of ornan stop this is the place of judgment but at the place of judgment is where god extended mercy at the threshing floor is where he stopped at the threshing floor he gave david an opportunity and david come at that spot and he offered a sacrifice unto the lord and the lord had the angel of the lord put his sword in his sheath and now you find mercy and judgment at the threshing floor it's a place of mercy and it's a place of judgment now let's look at second chronicles chapter 3. ii chronicles chapter 3 verse 1. we know that david wanted to build a tabernacle a temple to the lord but he was not permitted but his son solomon was going to do it and verse chapter 3 verse 1 says then solomon began to build the house of the lord at jerusalem in mount moriah where the lord appeared unto david his father in the place that david had prepared and the threshing floor of ornan the jebusite where was solomon's temple built on the threshing floor where was the ark placed on the threshing floor where was the temple of god on the threshing floor what was it it was a place of mercy and it was a place of judgment for the nation of israel amen it was a place of the mercy seat of god but the mercy seat of god with no blood covering was also the judgment seat of god it was the footstool of god the throne of god it was the place where which he would judge all of israel and where was it it was the same threshing floor and god offered unto them a place to find mercy and a way to find mercy in the threshing floor if they would come god's appointed way if they would come according to god's word amen the threshing floor became a mercy seat for all of israel if they stayed with god's word it also became a place of judgment if they left god's word where on the threshing floor and the time of wheat harvest we're in the time of wheat harvest we've come to the threshing floor this is the time of separation solomon come and he and he and he come to build this and he built it in moriah in mount moriah amen and mariah has mentioned what other place in the bible and it's mentioned back in genesis 22 when god tests abraham and he tells abraham to take his son his only son unto moriah unto the mount that i should tell thee of and so abraham takes his son takes isaac the promised son the promise of god the word of god made manifest he takes his son and where is he going he's going right back to the same place amen where later would become a threshing floor would we be where the angel stopped the destruction of jerusalem will be where the temple was going to be built he goes to moriah to one of the mountains i should tell thee of and there he builds an altar and there he goes to sacrifice his son but right when he goes to sacrifice his son god extends mercy so that isaac doesn't have to die and he provides the substitutes and the ram caught in the thicket amen praise be to god he come he passed the test he could fulfill the word of god abraham was going to do all god said for him to do and he come to the place that would later be the threshing floor that would later be the temple that would be the testing ground and abraham passed the test by keeping the word of god and not withholding his son his only son from the lord praise god god is not asking us to give our sons but he's asking us to give the offspring of our desires he's asking us to give up the offspring of our thoughts of our minds so many times we have coming from our mind our own thoughts and we treasure that own thought we treasure that desire as a life like a child like our own offspring because it comes from us but praise god god is asking us to lay all that down on the altar to lose our own thinking to lose our own desires to lose our own production amen our own affection to lose it all amen and god amen will give us mercy at the judgment seat amen so we find moriah mentioned amen and that's where abraham called him jehovah jireh god who seeds the provider and it says in genesis 22 14 and abraham called the name of that place jehovah jireh as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen so this place became the mount of the lord which is the place where the tabernacle would or the temple would later sit solomon's temple amen and all the way back with abraham it was a place of judgment it was a place of testing it was a place of separation abraham separating from his own self from his own desire from his own will and just taking the word and god showed mercy at that altar let's go to first corinthians chapter nine this is where i wanna start bringing it home a little bit i hope that you don't mind my slow bible study approach but you can't blow through these things and catch what god's saying in the word and so many times we miss there's so much laying in the word of god that we just breeze over but it's so rich and it's so full we will never come to the end of discovering this bible while we're here on this earth first corinthians chapter 9 verse 6. paul now speaking to the corinthians says are i only in barnabas have not we power to forbear working who go with the warfare any time at his own charges who planteth the vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof or who feedeth the flock and he does not of the milk of the flock he's talking about he and barnabas were working for their wages not taking the tithe of the people but he says don't we have a right to take the tithe of the people and look at what he says verse 9 for it is written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn does god take care for oxen or saith thee it altogether for our sakes for our sakes no doubt this is written that he that plows should plow in hope and he that threshes in hope should he be partaker of his hope if we have sown unto you spiritual things it is a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things so this is not about tithing it's not about paying the preacher i just want to focus on verse 9. for it is written in the law of moses thou shall not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn what is he talking about he's talking about threshing the ox treadeth the corn tramples upon it on the threshing floor and now the apostle paul is bringing his ministry to the church and his right to receive of their tithe and tying it into the act of threshing on the threshing floor and say didn't he even say don't muzzle the mocs as he talks as he treaded out the corn he even has a right to a portion of it as he's doing the work of threshing so what now is preaching what now is the preacher what now is the pastor he's the ox treading out the corn amen what is the what is what do we come to church for amen that i say this is a threshing floor amen let this be a threshing floor amen and let the minister come to the pulpit be the ox that's treading out the corn amen and and say god what what are we coming to church for i'm coming to be separated from carnality i'm coming to i'm coming to have exposed to me parts and particles of the world that are still sticking on i'm coming amen to be separated from everything that's not god's original thought of me and so the apostle paul attaches the the right to take offering in time with this this obscure scripture doesn't the ox even have a right don't muzzle the oxide treadeth out the corn and what's paul saying i'm treading your corn amen i'm laboring in the spiritual things i'm i'm i'm threshing out the wheat amen and he's showing that the ministers are right to protect because he's threshing out the wheat so what is church threshing out the wheat what is the minister the ox trotting upon the corn amen praise be to god amen this will help us not to get offended when we get stepped upon now when we get stepped upon now listen this doesn't mean everything a preacher ever says is always right i mean we're human beings there's there's times that we can say something a little too far this way a little too far that way but that's why i'm so glad god made me a pastor and not an evangelist i got weeks to fix that thing say it too strong here i can come back and come over here and say it this way that's the mercies of god for me i don't have to qualify everything in one sermon so it's not as though everything the preacher said line it up with the word you have the message you know what's right and what's wrong it doesn't make the man behind the pulpit infallible but what's his job what's he doing he's treading out the corn now let's look at the treading out the corn and say next time you get stepped on don't say what is he saying say is am i being separated is there something clinging that needs to come off amen is there a thought an idea hey listen i i remember when i when i first really got serious with god and come to the message god started dealing with us and when you really give your heart to the lord he starts dealing with you and smoking and drinking and swearing and right and those there's a separation ungodly friends and associations there's a separation then you keep coming back to church and you keep getting trot upon you keep listening to the message reading your bible you keep getting trot upon and then he starts dealing with things that you look at and things that you listen to not so much your actions but what you're feeding on and then then you get trot on that gets separated and he keeps trotting upon you and trotting upon you until now god is dealing with the thoughts that are buried in your heart not what you speak and not what you do but what you think about a situation you come to church and god starts trotting upon your wrong thinking and nobody else knows you were thinking like that nobody else knows you were struggling with that that you had that bitterness or you had that uh that odd against the brother or you had that wrong idea nobody knows amen but the ox doesn't know anything the ox is just walking around it's not the ox it's the man driving the ox amen and he's like and what's he doing he's getting everything that's not original seed original life original child of god and he's separating it from us look at first peter let's look at first peter together i think it's so significant that the house of the lord was built on the threshing floor that god started by planting a garden that the parable of the kingdom is the son of man sowed seed which were children of the kingdom and an enemy sow but there'll be a harvest time and a separation and so god built the temple on a threshing floor god judged jesus at a threshing floor god brought the ark the presence of god back in at the time of the wheat harvest all of this is pointing to our day and god's purpose god is finishing his final act of gathering his seed in this day and he's finishing the threshing and the separating and bringing back pure seed this is the day that we live in first peter chapter 4. first peter chapter 4 verse 16. yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify god on this behalf for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god where does judgment begin the house of god where was the house of god been solomon's day at a threshing floor what happened at that threshing floor amen judgment was stayed when an offering was made and that's where the ark was set judgment judgment let me read this again verse 16. yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not should be ashamed i'm sorry what verse did i start with 16 17 for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him and well-doing as unto a faithful creator when judgment must begin where at the house of god what is the house of god it's not this building the house of god are these buildings this is his dwelling place this is the body of christ this is the tabernacle of god it means where the spirit of god dwells amen and judgment must begin at the house of god and the house of god is his people and you say why is it i can get away with nothing because judgment must begin at the house of god why is it every time i do something somebody preaches on it because judgment must begin at the house of god until we get to the place where we say thank you god amen i'm so thankful amen that you want me back in your garner amen you want me you'll take me through the threshing process you'll take me but it's the threshing floor is also a place of mercy it's not just a place of judgment it's a place of mercy because that's where he put his mercy seat in the message the indictment the prophet of god said and i want to kind of use it more like if it was like a room of a courtroom and after all the pulpit and the church is a courtroom it's a judgment seat that it must begin at the house of the lord we'll read through several several statements like this there's a little things that we do and that's what we come to church for is to find out where our faults is so if you only come to church to be told how wonderful you are you're the bride all the promises are yours god loves you so much everything's wonderful go home hey you know that's true all of those things are true and i want to hear them do you want to hear him i love when he whispers love secrets in our ears but there's something that we need along with that amen we need the encouragement but we also need the correction amen because we need separation and we that's why we come to church wars to find out where our fault is and the things that we might better ourselves by if we come to church for any other objective than this i'm afraid we won't get too much out of coming to church we must come to find our weaknesses find our bad places and see how little we are and put our trust in somebody that's stronger i say praise god for this i love this statement i love this quote and the message second-handed road he says well one day he went up there to the school of the prophets to visit them and they asked him to leave they said it's too straight around here for us what we need today is some more what we need today is some more straight gospel preaching that'll separate the wheat from the chaff or the right from the wrong and i say amen amen if it if if it rakes the height off of me i don't need my height anymore i'm getting a new body amen amen you know the the when the when the when the wheat comes to the threshing floor i mean sometimes that shuck is sticking pretty tight down at the base of that weed and it just needs some extra persuasion to cut loose it needs some extra pressure amen and the pressure was never intended to destroy the wheat because the wheat was the object all along the seed was the point of the story it was the point of the sowing it was the reason for the husbandman being in the field having a a fan in his hand having a threshing floor all of it is for the seed so none of this is to destroy the seed all of this is to bring the seed back into its proper condition so let it do the work it's supposed to do if it rakes hard let it rake hard because sometimes things stick really tight there are things in our lives that just stick really tight and the things that stick to tightest sometimes are our own ideas about things and our own affections our own lusts our own human desires things that we want out of life things that we want to accomplish things that we want to do things that we like amen and those are sometimes the things that stick tightest to us amen but god is bringing his word amen again and again and again and rolling us through the fleshing floor and tossing us because we've got to lose our own lust amen we've got to lose our own idea we've got to come to the place where we can surrender all and say it's not my will it's not my mind it's you god it's all you your word is right and i'm always wrong but you know sometimes you know the wheat's rolling around and may not realize this thing's still sticking sometimes we don't realize there's still things that gotta go if we've been serving god those of you who've been serving god any length of time you know what it's like to think all as well then all of a sudden god exposes something else and he exposes something deeper down than on the surface something that's below the surface because we can get everything on the surface to go right but sometimes things below the surface aren't right so the word word of god i've said before god is the best heart surgeon there ever was he can cut so deep nobody else can find it to remove what doesn't belong there and the mess message watchman one of the nine says oh god oh if they would rejoice when the harvest began what ought we do when the harvest is over winnowing time is here now separating the chaff this is the time then how can you hold your peace without blasting it out just exactly this is winnowing time yes sir when you beat the husk off the week that's exactly right this is the time for what beating the husk off the wheat what will beat the husk of the week not an arrogant nasty attitude i want you to think about this prophet of god said we need uh the gospel preached straight that'll separate the chaff and the wheat we need to beat the shaft off of the wheat but let's not get the wrong idea in my mind that we have to be harsh and nasty and forceful and hard-lined we don't have to have that attitude let's watch this in the scriptures watch it in the word see this is the messiest sign of his coming 1962 so then he said to the pharisees your generation of snakes who's warned you to flee from the wrath that's to come to stand out there he said i will thoroughly purge his floor he will gather up wheat into his garner he will sweep her clean and he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire this is the uh john the baptist speaking john the baptist is giving this declaration amen his fan is in his hand he'll thoroughly purge his threshing floor he'll he'll burn the chaff with unquenchable fire so this is the uh john the baptist preaching and the axe is laid to the root of the tree oh my what a messiah coming but then when he got there little meek gentle fellow shoulder stooped down the bible said no beauty we should desire him man of sorrow acquainted with grief the bible said he wouldn't quench a smoking flax the john the baptist painted the picture like he was going to you know like that day in the temple when he threw out the money changers like that was going to be his ministry every day i mean throwing the tables over beating their backs straightened up he did that one time to fulfill the scripture which said the zeal of the of the lord is is eating me up so that's the that's the image john was looking for that's the picture he was painting and in the messy three kinds of believers from 63 he says when the crowds were separating between the believers and unbelievers and make believers there was all three of them standing right there in the one company of people believers make believers unbelievers right found in this chapter right there and because that jesus spoke the words the way he had it separated his congregation but it must be done he was a great man as long as he healed the sick but when it come down to the doctrine and the prophecy that's what separated the chaff from the wheat the chaff only wraps around the wheat it's not the wheat it cannot be used there's nothing in it no life in it it's the husk and it cannot stay with the wheat it won't be air with the wheat and so it's got just the grain is what we're talking about the heart of the grain of the wheat so jesus when he came john the baptist had painted the picture of a man with a fan in his hand thoroughly purging his threshing floor amen burning the chaff with unquenchable fire the axe is now laid to the root of the tree all of these things but jesus come along meek and and you know when they would come against him he'd slip through the crowd and go somewhere else amen when they wanted to kill him jerusalem he stayed out of jerusalem for a period of time amen but he was still doing the work of separating but how was he doing the work of separating he was doing it by the word amen he was he was saying amen uh you know unless you drink my blood and eat my flesh you have no life with me you know he didn't have to be mean the statement itself was going to bring a separation he was preaching the truth amen of spiritual communion of partaking of christ he said lest you drink my blood and eat my flesh you have no life with me and many of his disciples said this is a hard saying who can hear it amen and many walked away and then they they go to ask him you know it's a hard saying and he says well if you don't like that what about if you shall see the son of man return into heaven where he came from and the rest walked away what was he separating by not by his attitude not by his hardness or his harshness he was separating by the revelation of the word he was dropping the revelation of the word and they couldn't handle the word for their day they couldn't handle the fresh revelation of the word amen it was confusing to them it didn't sound right it actually sounded wrong to drink blood and eat flesh and you as a human being come down from heaven it didn't sound right it was it didn't make sense to their understanding it didn't sound like what they had been been hearing in their traditional understanding amen and he brought the word amen in such a way it brought a separation amen and the message has come to bring us back to the true revelation of the word for our day and the message brings separation not with an arrogant attitude not with a hateful speech or a hard delivery it brings you can whisper the true revelation and it'll bring a separation amen because what was god doing he was separating the wheat from the husk he had 70 that had went two by two preaching the gospel and now they walked away and he turns to peter and to the disciples he said well you go also he is this is not the gathering time for jesus's ministry this is the time that he's blowing chaff away separating out the multitude separating out the 70 turning to the closest friends is his closest companions as helping the ministry to the disciples and he said will you go also and peter says to whom shall we go thou alone have the words they had no place else to go they didn't have an explanation for what he said they didn't have an understanding or comprehension of what they said what they had was a c gene on the inside that could say there's no place else to go this is truth amen this is right i may not understand it i can't explain it i don't know why everybody's leaving but this is the truth amen and what was he doing he was using the revelation of the word to separate the chaff from the wheat amen i say what do we do to trodden up the corn preach the true word of god preach the revelation it's our preach the message the way it was delivered to us amen and it'll separate the the chaff from the wheat brother brahms says in questions and answers from 1964 says how can i take a cockle burr and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it the only way it can be is because inside that cockle burn has been transmitted from cockapoo wheat a cockapoo to a germ called wheat life then you bury that cockapoo in a produced grain of wheat that's right see because there has been a life of wheat put in the cockabur and the life of the cockapoor has been taken out but the nature of the crocodile is still sticky and it will be until this new life has fully been developed out of the ground and raised up again then it comes forth then it is no cocklebur but wheat but while it's here on earth and in out of the earth the cockapoo is still sticky but it's got the nature on the inside of wheat now he's talking about you and i and as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of christ and all the sin is gone from you that's the thing praise be to god when we come to the final threshing right at the end of all threshing the last thing for me to be separated from is the old man the cocklebur that's sticking tight to me is my flesh and my human spirit but this word is bringing such a separation it's dividing the bones and the moral as the soul and the spirit what's doing it the sword of the word it's dividing that carnal spirit from the soul what's the word doing it's bringing a separation it's threshing it's saying that's the old man and that old man has got to go it cannot stay and you're threshing and threshing and threshing until the final tearing away of that seed will be the tearing away of the old body and bringing of the glorified body oh let's be threshed let's stay on the floor amen and stay on the floor at the altar of god at the ark of the judgment seat which is the mercy seat let's stay there and stay under the under the word until it strips away everything that's not original word so we come back to god's original idea amen there's one more scripture i'd like to look at together and that's ruth chapter 3. let's go to ruth ruth chapter 3. we know the story of ruth really well we've been through it many times but i just want to review some of it ruth had was a mole bite she was a gentile and naomi and her husband abimelech had went down into moab with their two boys and they had taken their gentile wives and there was a because there was a famine in israel they had run away from the land they had sold their inheritance and lost their inheritance and gone down the moab but then abimelech and the two sons die and so now naomi and the daughters-in-laws are widows we know one stays behind but ruth pledges to come with naomi she returns back to bethlehem with naomi and she begins to serve naomi and she begins to work in the field gleaning at the time of the barley harvest and the barley harvest is a type of gathering into the jews and the wheat harvest is a type of gathering in the gentiles then after that is the vintage or the wine press and that's a type of gathering back to 144 000. so all the harvest types god's harvest in the world pulling back his scene but in the time of barley harvest she's in there she's she's laboring she's working but but it comes a time that naomi gives her some instructions and let's look here at chapter 3 verse 1. then naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall i not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and now is not boaz of our kindred with whose maidens thou ha thou wast behold he went with barley tonight in the threshing floor we're going back to the threshing floor he went with barley in the threshing floor wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put the raiment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto man until he shall have done eaten and drinking and it shall be when he lieth down that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie and thou shall go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what thou shall do she said unto her all that thou sayeth unto me i will do and she went down into the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law made her and when boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she said i am ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art near kinsmen and he said blessed be thou of the lord my daughter for thou has showed more kindness in thy latter end than at the beginning i want you to pay attention to that statement thou has showed more kindness in thy latter end than at the beginning in so much as thou followers not young men whether poor or rich and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman here comes ruth she's a widow she's a young woman she's returned back with naomi and they're in a desperate situation and naomi begins to analyze the situation and she's gleaning in the field of boaz and boaz is showing her favor and having the reapers drop handfuls of purpose for her to pick up even sitting at the table with them he feeds her of his own hand and so naomi's putting the pieces together amen and she tells ruth amen go into the threshing floor amen he's finished finishing the barley harvest he's at the time he's finishing the barley harvest who is boaz he's the lord of the harvest is that right he's the lord of the harvest he's the one with the fan in his hand he was purging his floor and at the time he's finishing the barley harvest amen he has a great feast at the end of the barley harvest amen and he lays himself down to sleep just like jesus christ after he's finished gathering amen the old testament and then he lays himself down to sleep and at that time she comes into the threshing floor which is the place of separation the place of judgment and she lays herself down at the feet of the lord of the harvest in the place of separation and judgment and what is she doing she is giving her life away what is ruth doing she's giving her life away what is she giving her life away for she's giving it away for redemption amen she's not there for money she's not there for lust she's not there for a handsome husband he says thy kindness is greater in the end than it was in the beginning it was her kindness to come with naomi it was her kindness to support naomi but he said the kindness at your ladder and is greater than in the beginning because now she's surrendering herself completely to the lord of the harvest she's giving up any hope for a younger man she's not there she's not there amen because of his good looks she's not there because of his money she's there to give herself away for the purpose of redemption ruth is sacrificing herself on the threshing floor ruth is going to give herself and marriage to boaz an older man he says you didn't seek after young men showing that he was an older man she's she's giving away herself on the threshing floor ruth is sacrificing herself for redemption that's why we're a type of ruth let us come into the threshing floor and lay ourselves at the feet of the lord of the harvest and let's lay down and say i'm giving up my life for you i'm giving up my life for redemption i'm giving myself completely she was asking to become his wife amen because the only way for redemption was for her to receive seed from the lord of the harvest and that seed she would raise up seed and that seed would be able to purchase the right of redemption back for naomi it would restore back so she had to give herself just like mary had to sacrifice herself to bring forth the promised seed mary was a young woman mary was engaged to be married to a man to a man named joseph she was a young girl amen but the angel of the lord came to her and say this is the time of the fulfillment of the word and you're the place for the word to be fulfilled but mary had to surrender all her ideas her ambitions her hopes for her family her dreams of the future she had to give everything up she had been thinking to receive this word and to say be it unto me according to thy word what was mary doing mary was sacrificing herself for redemption what was ruth doing ruth was coming to the threshing floor to lay her feet down herself at the feet of the lord of harvest to give herself for redemption and what are you and i here to do we are here to come on the threshing floor to lay our life down it doesn't matter what i thought what i hoped what i wanted the way i thought it was going to work out my own ideas my own concept of the way things should run i'm here to come to the threshing floor to lay it all down to lay myself at your feet so you can plant a seed in me that will finish the work of redemption that's what the bride has come to in this hour and i say lord let me lay myself down on the threshing floor let me give up everything i ever wanted or thought for redemption this plan of redemption is so beautiful this plan of redemption is so perfect this plan that we see all through the bible is so beautiful why wouldn't we want to give ourselves to it i want to do what ruth did and lay myself down at the feet of the lord of the harvest and give myself away give myself completely away for the purpose of redemption say god you're a good thresher thresh me out o lord purge me cleanse my heart let me be what you wanted me to be before the foundation of the world when you saw me in your mind and now i'm here living out my portion of the drama let me come to the threshing floor and find there a place of mercy for me let me find a place of mercy as i lay my down my life down and sacrifice myself for this plan of redemption for this word in the end time i want to lay it down and said take me be it unto me according to thy word is that your dream is that your hope is that your desire to be all that he wants us to be amen let's all stand together musicians if you would come please amen there's so many places in the bible that we could turn to and so many things we could look at and remember this theme holds true god is separating us unto himself god is looking for a surrendered vessel he's looking for somebody that will give up that'll lay down that'll come willingly and lay upon the threshing floor to become one with him so that he can finish his work of redemption in this day and i for one want to keep coming to the threshing floor is it always convenient nope is it always easy absolutely not does it sometimes hurt have you ever been hurt by the word if you haven't stick around [Music] but it's all for god's great plan and god's great purpose and i say thank god that for some the threshing floor is a place of judgment but not for me for me it's a place of mercy because god wanted me from before the foundation of the world and he wants just that part that he sowed and so he's stripping everything else away and i say thank you lord let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father for your word lord god i pray that you would do the work in this hour that you promised to do lord we've come lord to the place of judgment we've come to your word and lord we just want to lay ourselves down now and say lord we're yours we're surrendering we're giving up we're laying ourselves at your feet take us and use us for your kingdom lord god let that word strip away all of our wrong ideas all of our wrong concepts let that word strip away everything that's not part of your original word your original thought and help me to remain patient lord to not get the disturbed in my mind at the trials and at the testing but help me remain patient and let patience have a perfect work making me entire complete wanting nothing god help me to remain in the hand of the one with the winnowing fork the fan as you purge your floor as you separate out of me everything that's not like you help me to remain patient and trusting and loving as i see you working producing something on the threshing floor more and more wheat and greater concentration i say oh god let your word continue to work in my life work in the lives of these people lord i pray that you take your sheep back to yourself take your seed back into yourself into the garner and strip away from us everything lord that's not word we love you father we ask that you would bless us as we go from here anoint us be with us guide us in every way we put you first help us to put you first in all things and help us to
