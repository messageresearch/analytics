[4:28] one thing i have learned in all my life
[4:32] i believe
[4:42] that really counts yes
[5:08] is
[5:10] the lord i'm sure that's each and every
[5:12] one of our
[5:13] prayers and desires this morning
[5:17] everything to gain nothing to lose
[5:21] what a position to be in what a
[5:23] privileged
[5:24] position to be in there's only a select
[5:27] group of people in the face of this
[5:28] earth that can say that and it be true
[5:32] everybody else has everything to lose
[5:35] and nothing to gain what a privileged
[5:37] position
[5:38] we're in just greet you in the name of
[5:40] the lord jesus christ this morning we
[5:42] certainly deem it a great privilege to
[5:44] speak to the bride of jesus christ and
[5:46] those that he has
[5:47] purchased by his own blood we don't take
[5:50] that lightly
[5:51] we just consider it an honor and a
[5:53] privilege if you have your bibles we'll
[5:55] turn straight to the scriptures this
[5:57] morning
[5:59] and we're going to turn to first
[6:00] corinthians 15
[6:03] beginning with verse 51
[6:09] and i would like to speak on the subject
[6:12] of the going
[6:14] of the bride beginning
[6:18] first corinthians verse 15 chapter 51
[6:22] or i'm sorry verse 51
[6:27] says behold i show you a mystery
[6:31] we shall not all sleep but we shall all
[6:34] be changed
[6:36] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[6:39] at the last trump for the trumpet shall
[6:42] sound
[6:43] and the dead shall be raised
[6:45] incorruptible
[6:46] and we shall be changed that's our
[6:50] promise saints
[6:52] sages and prophets and every person
[6:54] that's walked the face of this earth
[6:56] has looked for that promise but that's
[6:59] our day and our hour and
[7:01] our promise let's
[7:04] turn to first thessalonians chapter 4.
[7:20] first step thessalonians chapter 4
[7:23] beginning with verse
[7:24] 15 speaking along the same lines he says
[7:28] for this
[7:28] we say unto you by the word of the lord
[7:31] that we which are alive and remain unto
[7:33] the coming of the lord shall not prevent
[7:35] them which are asleep
[7:37] for the lord himself shall descend from
[7:40] heaven with a shout
[7:41] with the voice of the archangel and the
[7:43] trump of god and the dead in christ
[7:45] shall rise first
[7:47] then we which are alive and remain shall
[7:49] be caught up together with them in the
[7:51] clouds
[7:52] to meet the lord in the air and so shall
[7:54] we ever
[7:55] be with the lord let's just bow our
[7:57] heads for a moment
[8:00] precious lord jesus we just want to
[8:01] pause here a moment to ask you to come
[8:03] and have the preeminence once again lord
[8:06] we've came and we've sang the songs of
[8:09] zion
[8:10] there's a wonderful atmosphere created
[8:12] lord
[8:13] we've read your holy script but lord now
[8:16] we would
[8:17] just like to set ourselves aside both
[8:19] speaker and here
[8:21] and just ask that the lamb would come
[8:23] and do only that which the lamb can do
[8:25] and is worthy to do
[8:27] and to take this book and these words
[8:29] therein and to loose them and to break
[8:31] them to the people
[8:33] lord we commit ourselves to you thankful
[8:35] for this opportunity
[8:37] giving you praise for this opportunity
[8:39] and we just
[8:40] asked now that you would come and do
[8:42] that which you have divinely purposed
[8:44] this time for
[8:46] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[8:48] pray and the bride says
[8:50] god bless you as you would have your
[8:52] seats i would like to direct you to a
[8:55] quote
[8:55] that i guess was started my inspiration
[8:58] for this in 1964
[9:01] recogni recognizing your day and its
[9:03] message
[9:04] brother branham says as a minister of
[9:06] the gospel
[9:08] i can't see one thing left but the going
[9:12] of the bride this is a very
[9:15] direct statement it's a very profound
[9:17] statement but if you brother branham
[9:19] says if you
[9:20] take a scripture and you look at it
[9:22] shallowly you'll get a shallow answer
[9:26] the same thing will apply with this
[9:27] quote if you take this quote
[9:29] and you look at look at it shallowly
[9:31] then you'll get a shallow answer
[9:33] so i'm going to finish reading this and
[9:35] then i'm going to come back to that
[9:36] portion
[9:38] and the bride has to be taken away
[9:40] before they can recognize what's
[9:42] happened
[9:42] speaking of the jews they were scattered
[9:45] blinded and now gathered what's left
[9:49] the bride has to be taken out of the way
[9:52] waiting for the going of the bride
[9:54] so that their prophets of revelation 11
[9:56] can call them to the feast of trumpet
[9:58] and to make them recognize what they've
[10:00] done so he's laying that in there that
[10:03] before anything
[10:04] can happen with the jews that the bride
[10:05] has to be taken out of the way
[10:07] and he says as a minister of the gospel
[10:09] and obviously we know he's the prophet
[10:10] for the age he says that i can only see
[10:12] one thing left before that happens and
[10:16] that's the going
[10:17] of the bride but what we have to make
[10:20] sure is we don't look at this with a
[10:21] shallow
[10:22] impression that the going of the bride
[10:24] is if any different than the coming of
[10:26] the bride
[10:27] because the coming of the bride is a
[10:30] process
[10:32] just like the coming of christ was a
[10:35] process
[10:37] christ came and that was a process
[10:40] christ went and that was a process
[10:43] the bride has come and that's been a
[10:46] process
[10:47] and when the bride goes and as the
[10:50] bride's going
[10:51] that will be a process so we have to
[10:53] make sure that we don't just get hung
[10:54] up on the going of the bride and we take
[10:57] all of that and tie it into these
[10:59] scriptures that we
[11:00] just first read that oh that's just a
[11:01] moment and a twinkling of an eye
[11:04] that that's just one little dot that's
[11:06] the going
[11:08] no that's the culmination of the going
[11:10] but the going
[11:12] is the same as the coming and the going
[11:14] is going to be exactly
[11:17] like christ's going was and that's what
[11:20] we really want to look at
[11:22] this morning is it's just very i don't
[11:25] necessarily want to preach this but i
[11:26] just want to
[11:27] take my time and very slow and teach
[11:29] these principles of the
[11:30] of the conditions and the requirements
[11:35] surrounding the first going of christ
[11:38] because that pattern is laid in the
[11:40] scriptures and whether you like it or
[11:42] whether i like it it doesn't matter
[11:44] that pattern will not change
[11:48] it will not change so the only thing
[11:50] that we can do
[11:52] is get on board with that because if not
[11:54] we're going to find ourself confused
[11:57] with no understanding and eventually
[11:59] we'll find ourselves fighting against
[12:01] the very plan of god
[12:02] and that's a condition we don't want to
[12:04] be in
[12:07] he says as a minister of the gospel
[12:10] i can only see one thing left
[12:13] the going of the bride if you'll take
[12:17] your bibles and turn to matthew chapter
[12:19] 21
[12:20] and you can keep your bibles handy
[12:22] because we're going to go through
[12:23] several scriptures here in matthew
[12:25] beginning in chapter 21 and ending in
[12:27] chapter 26.
[12:30] this is going to lay down the patterns
[12:32] the pattern and the condition
[12:34] surrounding the process of the going
[12:38] in jesus's life matthew 21
[12:41] verse 6 it says and the disciples went
[12:45] and did as jesus commanded them and
[12:48] brought the ass the cult
[12:50] and put them on them their clothes and
[12:52] they set him there on
[12:54] and a very great multitude spread their
[12:56] garments in the way
[12:57] notice what class of people this is a
[12:59] very great multitude
[13:01] spread their garments in the way others
[13:03] cut down branches from the trees
[13:05] and straw them in the way strew them in
[13:08] the way
[13:09] and the multitude that went before and
[13:11] that followed cried hosanna
[13:13] to the son of david blessed is he that
[13:16] cometh
[13:17] in the name of the lord hosanna in the
[13:20] highest
[13:21] and when he was come into jerusalem
[13:25] all the city was moved saying who is
[13:28] this
[13:28] and the multitude said this is jesus
[13:32] the prophet of nazareth of galilee
[13:36] so here is a here is a great multitude
[13:40] and this is the coming of jesus this is
[13:42] the culmination of his
[13:44] of his coming he's now coming into the
[13:46] holiest city he's now coming
[13:48] to where all these scriptures are going
[13:49] to be fulfilled he's coming into
[13:51] jerusalem
[13:53] and this multitude that is there they're
[13:54] worshiping him they're singing praises
[13:57] they're laying their clothes down
[13:58] they're laying the palm branches down
[14:01] and then somebody poses a question who
[14:04] is this
[14:05] and they give the response this is jesus
[14:07] the prophet of nazareth of galilee
[14:10] and they are 100 accurate and they are
[14:12] 100
[14:14] wrong
[14:17] this is the class of people that we are
[14:19] not
[14:21] this is the multitude this is not the
[14:23] bride
[14:24] and that's what the multitude sees they
[14:27] can get worked up when everybody else is
[14:29] getting worked
[14:30] up they can scream and worship with the
[14:32] best of them they can throw their
[14:33] clothes off
[14:34] they can throw palm branches down but
[14:36] when they come to have a definition of
[14:38] who this is
[14:44] well that's the message of the hour
[14:46] you're 100
[14:47] right you're 100 percent wrong
[14:53] who is this
[14:57] appropriate answer is this is god
[15:00] himself
[15:01] in the form of flesh that was the answer
[15:04] then
[15:04] that's the same answer now
[15:08] matthew 21 verse 12
[15:11] and jesus went into the temple and cast
[15:14] out all them that sold and bought in the
[15:16] temple and overthrew the tables of the
[15:18] money changers and the seats of them
[15:20] that sold doves
[15:21] and he said unto them it is written my
[15:24] house shall be called the house of
[15:25] prayer
[15:26] but ye have made it a den of thieves and
[15:28] the blind and the lame came to him in
[15:30] the temple and he healed them
[15:32] and when the chief priests and the
[15:33] scribes saw the wonderful things that he
[15:35] did
[15:36] and the children crying in the temple
[15:38] and saying hosanna to the son of
[15:40] david they were sore displeased
[15:44] and he said unto them hearst thou what
[15:46] they say us
[15:48] i'm sorry they said unto them unto him
[15:51] hear us now what they they say and jesus
[15:55] said unto them yea have ye never read
[15:58] out of the mouth of babes and sucklings
[16:01] thou hast perfected praise
[16:03] skipping to verse 45
[16:07] and when the chief priest and the
[16:09] pharisees
[16:10] had heard his parables they perceived
[16:13] that he spake of them
[16:16] but when they sought to lay hands on him
[16:19] they feared the multitude
[16:21] because they took him for a profit
[16:24] i don't know if you just caught it but
[16:27] in that portion of scripture
[16:29] we made the dispensational cornerstone
[16:31] of from the coming
[16:32] of jesus to the going of jesus
[16:36] and that transpired there in verse 15.
[16:40] and when the chief priest and the
[16:42] scribes saw the wonderful things that he
[16:44] did
[16:45] and the children crying in the temple
[16:47] and saying hosanna to the son of david
[16:50] they were sore displeased
[16:54] there's your cornerstone
[16:57] this is the point of the dispensational
[17:00] change
[17:01] this is the point where it goes from
[17:03] coming
[17:04] to his going and what that was is when
[17:07] he exposed them
[17:10] when he came in and he exposed them and
[17:14] he
[17:14] and he told them the truth
[17:18] something along the lines of i and my
[17:20] father are one
[17:24] they were sore displeased
[17:28] they would have culminated his going
[17:32] right then if they could
[17:35] but they couldn't because there were
[17:38] other
[17:38] factors that there were other scriptures
[17:42] concerning his going that had to be
[17:44] fulfilled but it says here in verse 46
[17:47] if they would have had it their way that
[17:50] would that his coming
[17:51] would have immediately been followed by
[17:53] his going it would have been a very very
[17:55] very quick process
[17:57] because they went from being very sore
[17:59] displeased
[18:00] to wanting to lay hands on him in verse
[18:02] 46
[18:03] and the only thing that stopped them
[18:07] was the multitude of people that they
[18:09] had not convinced yet
[18:11] and they needed something there was a
[18:14] there was we'll get to it here in a
[18:15] minute
[18:16] but there was something that the
[18:18] multitude needed
[18:20] to facilitate this going
[18:23] because they could not break the
[18:24] scriptures
[18:27] but we have to hone in on this because
[18:29] this is extremely because as
[18:31] i this is extremely important because
[18:33] like i said before the pattern's not
[18:35] going to change saints
[18:37] it doesn't matter where whether we like
[18:40] it or whether we don't like it or
[18:41] whether we're comfortable with it or
[18:42] whether we're not comfortable with it
[18:44] this is a scriptural pattern it will
[18:48] not change and the
[18:51] start of that is when jesus catches a
[18:54] revelation of who he is
[18:57] and he knows where to go and he knows
[18:59] where to set
[19:00] what to say and where to say it and who
[19:02] to say it to
[19:04] this is preeminence in flesh
[19:08] and he comes to the place where he's
[19:10] supposed to be and he speaks the words
[19:12] that he's supposed to speak
[19:13] and they are sore displeased
[19:18] matthew 24
[19:21] so that was ending that was in chapter
[19:24] 21
[19:25] and from 21 until 24
[19:29] he's just speaking parables to the
[19:30] multitude
[19:32] he's just laying the scriptures in there
[19:34] he's just speaking to them
[19:35] exposing them exposing you know the
[19:37] desires of their hearts he's he's just
[19:40] laying
[19:40] all those parables in there about them
[19:43] and about other things
[19:45] but he's speaking in parables to the
[19:47] multitude
[19:49] this changes when he comes to chapter
[19:51] 24.
[19:53] and jesus went out and departed from the
[19:55] temple
[19:57] that's the end of your church ages
[20:00] they're done this pattern
[20:03] will not change
[20:06] jesus went out of the temple
[20:10] he departed from the temple he
[20:14] he was not there anymore
[20:18] it didn't matter whether they wanted him
[20:21] to be there or not it didn't matter if
[20:22] they liked whether he was there or
[20:24] whether he wasn't there
[20:25] the fact of the matter was he was no
[20:28] longer there
[20:29] period
[20:32] and his disciples came to him for to
[20:36] show him the building of the temple
[20:38] and jesus said unto them see ye not all
[20:41] these things
[20:42] verily i say unto you there shall not be
[20:44] one there shall not be left here one
[20:46] stone upon another
[20:47] that shall not be thrown down and as he
[20:50] set up on the mount of olives
[20:52] the disciples came unto him privately
[20:56] notice this is a totally different group
[20:59] this is a totally different ministry
[21:02] this is a
[21:02] totally different class of people
[21:06] this is who he was dealing with
[21:10] dare i say this was a precursor to the
[21:12] bright age
[21:15] this was no longer in the temple in the
[21:17] church ages
[21:18] this was to a this was to a very select
[21:21] group of people
[21:23] this was to an exclusive group of people
[21:29] and this is the pattern that's laid down
[21:33] the disciples came unto him privately
[21:35] saying
[21:37] tell us when shall these things be and
[21:40] what shall be the sign of thy coming
[21:42] and of the end of the world they want to
[21:45] know the mysteries
[21:47] and they've come to him privately and
[21:50] they said
[21:50] tell us privately tell us
[21:55] these mysteries that you've been
[21:56] speaking about
[21:59] dare i say he opened the seals to them
[22:04] privately
[22:08] not to the multitude to his bride
[22:13] this was the shout out this was
[22:16] the precursor to the shout this is
[22:20] this is the pattern that was laid down
[22:23] that made
[22:24] first thessalonians or second
[22:26] thessalonians
[22:28] be accurate a shout a voice a trump
[22:32] this was the shout to the disciples
[22:35] this is the same scripture if you'll go
[22:37] back and pull the sixth
[22:39] seal this is the same chapter that
[22:41] brother branham takes
[22:43] to to break all of the six seals
[22:47] he goes back and picks up matthew 24
[22:50] and he shows how every seal laid in that
[22:55] and this is what the disciples are
[22:57] wanting to know privately
[22:59] and jesus took them to a place privately
[23:02] and he expounded on those things
[23:06] you'll notice jesus
[23:09] left the temple before he broke the
[23:12] seals
[23:14] like it or don't like it the seals were
[23:17] not broke in the temple
[23:19] the seals were not broke in the church
[23:22] ages
[23:23] we have to catch that pattern we have to
[23:26] understand that we're not going to
[23:28] change that
[23:30] and we can't have a problem with that
[23:32] this message is an exclusive message
[23:36] it is only to certain people
[23:40] that's god's choosing that's god's
[23:43] sovereignty
[23:44] we're not going to change that we should
[23:46] be happy that we're a part of that
[23:48] people
[23:50] that doesn't make us superior to anybody
[23:52] because it wasn't anything that we did
[23:55] it was his sovereign grace extended to
[23:58] us
[24:00] but just because i'm the recipient of
[24:03] his
[24:03] sovereign grace i am not going to try to
[24:06] change that
[24:08] and change his sovereign will and make
[24:10] it a social gospel or a social message
[24:12] the scripture shows the pattern is not
[24:14] like that and we can't try to change it
[24:17] it's only for a certain certain group of
[24:20] people
[24:22] the disciples came to him privately
[24:24] saying tell us the secrets
[24:26] and you know what he did he told them
[24:29] the secrets
[24:30] so let's go to chapter 26
[24:35] and this is where i really want to look
[24:39] at the conditions and the requirements
[24:42] surrounding because remember we're
[24:44] already in the going
[24:46] of his ministry now he's already came
[24:50] they got the multitude the scribes and
[24:52] the pharisees and the multitude
[24:54] and the religious leaders got so
[24:55] displeased at the things that he had to
[24:57] say
[24:58] that was the change we're not going back
[25:00] anymore now we're
[25:01] moving forward in the going this is now
[25:04] part of the going
[25:08] and it came to pass matthew chapter six
[25:10] verse one
[25:11] when jesus had finished all these
[25:13] sayings
[25:14] he said unto his disciples you know
[25:17] that after two days is the feast of the
[25:19] passover and the son of man is betrayed
[25:22] to be crucified so now
[25:26] he's taken them privately he's broken
[25:29] the seals to them
[25:30] and they've had a glorious time
[25:34] no doubt they had a wonderful time
[25:36] sitting there at the feet of jesus
[25:38] letting him break the seals to them
[25:43] may i say it was sweet in their mouth
[25:48] but now all of a sudden he says
[25:50] something that's not so sweet
[25:53] and this is after the seals have been
[25:56] broken
[25:57] he says something that comes after
[26:01] there's a sweetness in the mouth
[26:03] now there's something that becomes
[26:04] bitter in their belly
[26:07] he says and the son of man is betrayed
[26:10] to be crucified
[26:12] then assembled together the chief
[26:14] priests and the scribes and the elders
[26:16] of the people under the place
[26:17] the palace of the high priest who was
[26:20] que ephesus
[26:21] and they consulted that they may might
[26:23] take
[26:24] jesus by subtility and kill him
[26:28] but they said not on the feast day lest
[26:30] there be an uproar among the people
[26:33] now when jesus was in bethany in the
[26:35] house of simon the leper there came
[26:38] unto him a woman
[26:41] having an alabaster box of very precious
[26:44] ointment
[26:45] this woman's the bride just so you we
[26:47] make that very clear
[26:49] having an alabaster box of very precious
[26:53] ointment
[26:54] and poured it on his head as he set at
[26:56] meat
[26:58] but when his disciples saw it they had
[27:00] indignation
[27:01] in the nation if you'll skip over you
[27:04] don't have to turn there but if you skip
[27:05] over to
[27:06] john this person this person this
[27:08] disciples identified as
[27:10] judas we know that but they had
[27:13] indignation saying to what purpose is
[27:16] this waste
[27:19] what purpose is this waste this is pure
[27:23] unadulterated total preeminence worship
[27:26] to god in flesh and it's identified by
[27:30] an individual as a waste
[27:35] for this ointment might have been sold
[27:37] for much and given to the poor
[27:39] then jesus understood it and said unto
[27:42] them why trouble ye the woman
[27:44] for she hath brought a good work upon me
[27:46] for ye have the poor
[27:48] always with you but ye but me ye have
[27:50] not always
[27:51] for in that she hath poured this
[27:54] ointment on my body
[27:56] she did it for my burial verily i say
[27:59] unto you
[28:00] wheresoever this gospel shall be
[28:02] preached in the whole world
[28:04] there shall also this that this woman
[28:07] hath done be told for a memorial of her
[28:12] then one of the tale 12 called judas
[28:14] iscariot
[28:16] went unto the chief priest and said unto
[28:18] them
[28:19] what will you give me for him and i will
[28:22] deliver him unto you
[28:24] and they coveted with him for 30 pieces
[28:27] of silver
[28:28] and from that time he meaning judas
[28:31] sought opportunity to betray him
[28:37] brother branham says that in the last
[28:39] moments of jesus's
[28:40] physical life here on earth there were
[28:43] so many
[28:44] multitudes and dozens and dozens of
[28:46] scriptures that transpired and were
[28:48] fulfilled
[28:49] he had thirty uh three and a half years
[28:51] worth of ministry but when he when he
[28:53] come down to that
[28:54] very last few moments of his ministry
[28:57] there were hundreds of scriptures
[28:59] brother brandon said were just fulfilled
[29:01] just like this
[29:02] one after another after another there
[29:04] were so many scriptures
[29:06] that laid in the old testament that were
[29:08] fulfilled just in this passage alone
[29:11] so many of them so we've had the
[29:15] multitude
[29:18] we've had the response of the multitude
[29:22] we've had the disciples we've had the
[29:24] response of the disciples
[29:26] but now we come to one person
[29:31] this is one person with jesus
[29:36] one person with jesus and this
[29:40] one person this one little bride
[29:44] is now going to do the thing
[29:49] that exposes not the spirit and the
[29:52] multitude
[29:54] but it's going to expose the spirit
[29:56] within the framework of the true
[29:58] church this is the
[30:01] portion that the multitude needed
[30:05] that they couldn't make happen because
[30:08] they weren't close enough
[30:10] because the scripture said it would
[30:11] deceive the very elective possible
[30:14] but now this one individual is going to
[30:18] do
[30:18] one thing that unleashes
[30:22] hell on earth that unleashes
[30:28] all demonic forces all satanic purposes
[30:32] to fulfill the scripture of what must
[30:35] take place to jesus
[30:36] one individual one little lady
[30:41] is going to do one thing that
[30:44] allows the scriptures to be fulfilled
[30:50] this one little lady is literally
[30:53] holding
[30:54] up all of the prophecies of the new of
[30:56] the old testament
[30:59] everything in the old testament relies
[31:01] on this
[31:02] one individual this one
[31:05] little unholy
[31:08] unrighteous full of mistakes
[31:13] woman she controls the
[31:17] piece she's the one with the watch in
[31:20] her hand
[31:21] she's the one that says what what will
[31:24] happen and when it will happen
[31:27] everything the culmination of
[31:31] jesus's physical coming now rests in
[31:34] this one little woman
[31:35] and she has no clue about it nobody has
[31:38] a clue about it
[31:39] not the disciples not the multitude
[31:43] she doesn't even know herself
[31:47] but everything that needs to transpire
[31:51] for me and you to even be setting and
[31:53] standing here today
[31:55] covered under the bleeding bloody word
[31:58] of
[31:58] god himself is now
[32:02] is now resting upon this little lady
[32:06] and she has one thing that she's going
[32:09] to do
[32:11] that allows the timepiece to continue
[32:16] and that one thing has nothing to do
[32:18] with an alabaster box
[32:22] but that one thing was even before the
[32:24] alabaster box
[32:26] when she decided i'm going to take
[32:28] everything that i have
[32:32] i am going to take everything that i
[32:34] have
[32:36] and i'm going to give it for this
[32:41] when that one little woman made
[32:44] that decision in that little room
[32:51] you know where i'm at when she made
[32:55] that one decision in that little room of
[32:58] her prayer closet
[32:59] i'm going to take everything that i've
[33:01] got
[33:03] and i'm going to give it to him
[33:07] nobody else on the face of the earth
[33:09] knew that the entire old and new
[33:11] testament was hinging upon
[33:13] this little lady nobody had a clue
[33:19] but what unleashed everything
[33:23] to continue as it was ordained to
[33:25] continue
[33:27] was this little lady standing in the way
[33:31] and what allowed that timepiece to
[33:33] continue
[33:35] was when she made the decision
[33:38] everything that i've got
[33:40] i'm going to give it
[33:44] that's what allowed it to continue
[33:47] that is the
[33:50] pattern
[33:54] you and i will not change that pattern
[33:57] it doesn't matter how much we work it up
[33:59] or how much we pull it down
[34:00] until we give all
[34:04] the timepiece will not move
[34:07] i've got news for you saints the news
[34:11] is not ran by a political force
[34:14] the news is not ran by climate control
[34:18] the news is not ran by an outside force
[34:21] what you read in the news is directly
[34:24] related
[34:25] to one little lady on the face of this
[34:28] earth
[34:32] one little lady on the face of this
[34:33] earth is controlling the headlines
[34:36] around the world
[34:38] that's what's in control nothing else is
[34:41] in control
[34:43] you and i are in control you and i are
[34:46] in control
[34:48] nothing else you say well god's in
[34:50] control that's what i said
[34:57] brother branham says god can do nothing
[35:01] unless he uses your hands unless he uses
[35:04] your feet
[35:05] unless he uses your mouth god can do
[35:09] nothing and
[35:12] god can do nothing until we are willing
[35:15] to
[35:16] give all that's the scriptural pattern
[35:20] 99 will not change it
[35:24] it has to be 100 so
[35:27] simple so simple
[35:30] so simple but yet the
[35:34] entire old and new testament hinged on
[35:36] that lady
[35:37] making that decision it had nothing to
[35:40] do with an alabaster box
[35:41] had nothing to do with the ointment had
[35:43] nothing to do with what she was wearing
[35:46] what it had to do with was when she gave
[35:48] preeminence
[35:50] and when she decided i'm going to give
[35:53] everything
[35:54] now the timepiece can continue
[35:58] because what this did when this little
[36:00] lady made that decision
[36:02] what this what this did
[36:06] was it allowed jesus to expose the judas
[36:11] that was in the midst
[36:14] because god can't force them to do
[36:15] anything they have to do it of their own
[36:17] free will
[36:18] so now jesus will create the situation
[36:20] for some little lady
[36:23] who's not worthy to come and give him
[36:26] true worship the way he's chosen to have
[36:27] true worship
[36:28] by giving preeminence by giving
[36:30] everything that she has and a result
[36:33] of that is the judas the judas spirit is
[36:37] exposed
[36:39] it can't help itself brother branham
[36:41] says that
[36:42] balaam he never really liked that that
[36:45] people of israel to begin with
[36:48] in his heart he never really liked them
[36:50] to begin with
[36:51] but he needed something to expose that
[36:55] the scripture says judas was a thief at
[36:57] heart
[36:59] but he needed something to expose that
[37:04] so this little lady unknowingly she
[37:06] don't care about all the repercussions
[37:08] she's not sitting around trying to
[37:10] figure out if i do this
[37:11] this will happen or what do i do and no
[37:15] she made a decision one thing
[37:18] i'm going to give everything that i have
[37:20] to that man
[37:22] and the results of that just happened
[37:25] she didn't have to make it happen what
[37:28] she did
[37:28] automatically exposed it because if
[37:32] you're a thief at heart or if you never
[37:33] really like that people to begin with
[37:35] it's going to be manifested
[37:40] but i'll say like the scripture says and
[37:41] like jesus says woe be to that man
[37:46] it would be better they were never born
[37:49] but you're not going to change the fact
[37:51] of that what's in a person's heart's
[37:53] going to be manifested
[37:55] that's the age that's the time that's
[37:57] the purpose that we live in
[38:00] so i don't know that i can lay enough
[38:02] emphasis on this
[38:05] but there's a lot more ground to cover
[38:06] so i'm going to move on
[38:08] but i wouldn't encourage you not because
[38:10] i've said it but i would encourage you
[38:11] to write it down
[38:12] because this is what everything hinges
[38:16] on everything hinges on this
[38:20] you can look and try to see well this is
[38:22] going on here and this is going on here
[38:24] what's going on i don't understand how
[38:26] don't worry about it
[38:29] don't worry about it it's not your place
[38:32] your place is this lady
[38:34] your place is to do what this lady did
[38:37] the rest of it will take care of it and
[38:38] as brother branham says if god needs you
[38:40] to know something or want you to know
[38:41] something he'll reveal it to you
[38:44] you worry about being this lady
[38:46] everything else will be just fine
[38:50] you'll notice this lady was not
[38:52] concerned about the persecution that was
[38:53] going to come
[38:56] no doubt she knew it was going to not be
[38:58] well received
[38:59] no doubt she knew there was going to be
[39:01] things said no doubt she knew
[39:03] they may even pick her up and throw her
[39:05] out
[39:07] this lady was not concerned about the
[39:10] after effects of giving all
[39:12] she was not operating in an element in a
[39:15] realm and a spiritual condition of fear
[39:19] this lady had no fear
[39:23] maybe in her carnal self in her hybrid
[39:25] flesh she she had mixed emotions but
[39:27] that's irrelevant
[39:29] because she had already made the
[39:30] decision i'm going to give all
[39:32] and that decision is not based on fear
[39:35] or what might happen she was not
[39:39] operating in an atmosphere of fear she
[39:42] was operating an
[39:43] atmosphere of pure unadulterated
[39:46] preeminence
[39:47] worship that's where we have to be at
[39:51] continuing in verse 36. so again i just
[39:56] maybe i need some big letters to hold
[39:59] that up in i don't know
[40:01] everything hinges
[40:05] on your and i preeminence
[40:08] to christ himself everything
[40:12] everything hinges on that nothing else
[40:15] can move
[40:15] until that takes place uh continuing in
[40:19] verse 36
[40:22] then cometh so that was number one of
[40:24] the conditions
[40:25] surrounding the going of jesus that was
[40:27] number one
[40:29] so let's move on down the list verse 36
[40:31] then cometh jesus with them unto a place
[40:34] called gethsemane
[40:35] and saith unto the disciples sit ye here
[40:38] while i go and pray yonder
[40:40] and he took with him peter and the two
[40:42] sons of zebedee
[40:44] and begin to be sorrowful and very heavy
[40:46] then
[40:47] saith he unto them my soul is
[40:49] exceedingly sorrowful
[40:51] even unto death tarry ye hear and watch
[40:54] with me
[40:55] and he went a little farther and fell on
[40:57] his face and prayed saying o my father
[40:59] if it be possible let this cup pass from
[41:01] me nevertheless not as i will but as
[41:04] thou wilt
[41:06] and he cometh unto disciples i'm going
[41:08] to stop right there before i
[41:09] read the next verse but i want you to
[41:12] realize
[41:14] we were reading a few verses ago in the
[41:16] coming
[41:17] and what a joyous time it was look how
[41:20] quickly that changed
[41:23] what changed is they turned a corner
[41:28] it changed from the coming to the going
[41:35] when it's coming it's joyous
[41:39] immediately when it turns to go it's no
[41:42] longer joyous
[41:43] it's sorrowful it's heavy the scripture
[41:46] says
[41:48] that's not a bad thing saints
[41:52] scripture is being fulfilled why does it
[41:54] matter if we're
[41:55] joyful when scripture is being fulfilled
[41:57] or if we're sorrowful when scripture is
[41:58] being fulfilled so long as scripture is
[42:00] being fulfilled
[42:02] because brother branham says god's will
[42:04] is his word
[42:06] and if his word is being fulfilled
[42:09] why why does it matter if we were happy
[42:11] or were sad about that
[42:14] it doesn't matter let's be
[42:17] happy where it matters
[42:21] in the realm that it matters
[42:24] by let by recognizing scriptures being
[42:28] fulfilled
[42:30] and he cometh unto the disciples and
[42:32] finding findeth them asleep
[42:34] and he saith saith unto peter what could
[42:38] you not watch with me but
[42:39] one hour watch and pray
[42:44] that ye enter not into temptation the
[42:46] spirit indeed is willing but the flesh
[42:48] is weak
[42:49] and he went away again the second time
[42:50] and prayed saying oh my father if this
[42:52] cup may not pass away from me
[42:54] i accept i drink it thy will be done and
[42:57] he came and found them asleep again
[43:00] for their eyes were heavy and he left
[43:02] them and went again
[43:04] and prayed the third time saying the
[43:06] same words
[43:08] then cometh he to his disciples and
[43:10] saith unto them
[43:11] sleep on now and take your rest
[43:15] behold the hour is at hand the son of
[43:17] man is betrayed into the hands of
[43:19] sinners
[43:20] rise let us be going behold he is at
[43:23] hand
[43:24] that doeth betray me condition number
[43:27] two surrounding the going of christ
[43:30] was the lack of the dedication to prayer
[43:35] not in the multitude
[43:40] in the true church
[43:44] even more so with three individuals in
[43:47] the true church
[43:51] that's condition number two those that
[43:54] he selected
[43:56] and anointed for prayer could not
[43:59] keep dedicated prayer
[44:02] for one hour
[44:06] the pattern's there it's not going to be
[44:09] changed
[44:13] fortunately we don't have to repeat
[44:16] what they did because that's not our
[44:19] position
[44:20] this pattern was laid here so we would
[44:22] recognize the conditions
[44:24] that would repeat but just because the
[44:27] conditions repeat
[44:29] our response doesn't have to be repeated
[44:34] you understand what i'm saying the
[44:36] conditions won't change
[44:37] that is set in stone it will not change
[44:40] that pattern is
[44:41] it's infallible the response
[44:46] to that condition and to that pattern
[44:48] depending on
[44:50] your time frame that you're living in
[44:52] can change
[44:54] because as the word comes the response
[44:57] can go higher and higher and higher
[44:59] but the pattern of the conditions and
[45:02] the anointings
[45:03] and the spirits surrounding those time
[45:05] frames as those events are occurring
[45:07] that will not change the only thing that
[45:09] can possibly change
[45:11] is as the ages move on and the timepiece
[45:14] moves on
[45:15] and the answers are given as paul says
[45:17] all these things that were done in the
[45:18] past were for our admonition
[45:21] now the response can change to be a
[45:24] correct response
[45:27] but this condition
[45:30] is here not will be here
[45:33] this condition is here and it has to be
[45:36] here because it was there
[45:38] it was in jesus first going it's got to
[45:40] be in jesus's second going
[45:43] yes i'm aware i just said jesus is
[45:45] second going
[45:48] misses jesus christ
[45:51] the conditions are going to be the same
[45:56] the inability to keep dedicated
[46:00] prayer
[46:03] for one hour that's all they ask
[46:07] just pray with me for an hour
[46:11] i'm not preaching doctrine i'm just
[46:12] saying what jesus said you can pray for
[46:14] however long you want to
[46:16] just don't repeat the cycle and when he
[46:20] says this is the key
[46:21] when he says now we should always pray
[46:26] but when he says pray with me
[46:31] when he says pray with me
[46:35] don't repeat the cycle
[46:38] you'll notice when jesus came to them
[46:40] the third time
[46:42] and he says sleep on now and take your
[46:44] rest
[46:45] he was not speaking to a natural
[46:47] condition
[46:50] because the very next verse he says rise
[46:52] let's go
[46:55] you just told me to sleep now you're
[46:56] telling me to go what do you want me to
[46:58] do
[46:59] he wasn't speaking to a natural
[47:01] condition and telling them to sleep
[47:03] what he was saying is they had failed
[47:05] the test
[47:07] so just go ahead and do whatever you're
[47:09] going to do now it's irrelevant but
[47:11] let's go the one that betrays me he's
[47:13] coming
[47:15] too late see they had already failed
[47:18] his response to them wasn't their
[47:20] natural condition
[47:22] his response was to their spiritual
[47:24] condition and he was letting them know
[47:27] you might as well just stay on in that
[47:30] you've done missed you've done missed
[47:32] the opportunity
[47:33] brother brenda says i'm getting ahead of
[47:36] myself
[47:38] that condition won't change
[47:42] it will not change but we don't have to
[47:44] repeat the cycle
[47:47] we have the ability and we have the
[47:49] anointing and we have the power
[47:52] to keep dedicated prayer time when he
[47:54] says to pray
[47:57] when he doesn't say to pray pray anyhow
[48:00] that's good
[48:01] that's wonderful that's we should do
[48:03] that
[48:04] but it's especially important
[48:08] when he says to pray
[48:14] totally different when he says to pray
[48:17] because if he's told you to do something
[48:20] he has to anoint you to do it
[48:23] brother branham says a man cannot do
[48:25] anything
[48:27] but yet god anoints him to do it
[48:30] so if he says do this he's got to anoint
[48:35] you to do it
[48:36] you have to receive that anointing to do
[48:38] it
[48:40] there's an emphasis being lay on prayer
[48:42] right now and i'm sorry i can't change
[48:44] my note just because what the pastor
[48:45] came out and said
[48:47] i can't help that blame it on him
[48:51] but the emphasis is on prayer and i want
[48:54] to say this and this is going to be bold
[48:56] and i hope it don't offend you
[48:58] but when jesus told the disciples to
[49:00] pray it was jesus in a corporal body
[49:02] standing there telling them to pray
[49:04] jesus in a corporal body is not going to
[49:06] come and tell you to pray
[49:10] how is he going to come and tell you to
[49:11] pray i just told you a little bit
[49:14] earlier
[49:15] god can do nothing but he uses your
[49:17] mouth your hands
[49:19] and your feet it's going to be a flesh
[49:22] vessel
[49:23] but it's not going to be the nail
[49:25] scarred corporal body of jesus christ
[49:27] telling you to pray
[49:29] better recognize who's speaking and
[49:31] who's telling us what to do
[49:34] and recognize that it's not just a man
[49:38] how miserable of a people we would be if
[49:40] we were just led by a man
[49:42] and what a man felt to do this condition
[49:45] is repeating
[49:48] and the reason that we're not going to
[49:50] repeat the failure is because we've
[49:52] been instructed not to that's his grace
[49:55] to us saints there's a reason that's
[49:57] being emphasized
[49:59] is because that condition is laying
[50:00] there and we're in the going of the
[50:02] bride
[50:04] and that's a condition that we have to
[50:05] combat
[50:08] matthew 26 47 and while he yet spake
[50:13] lo judas one of the twelve came and with
[50:15] him a great multitude with swords and
[50:17] staves
[50:18] from the chief priests and elders of the
[50:20] people
[50:21] now he that betrayed him gave them a
[50:23] sign saying
[50:24] whosoever i kiss that same as he
[50:28] hold him fast and forthwith he came to
[50:30] jesus
[50:31] and said hell master and kissed him
[50:34] and jesus said unto him friend
[50:39] wherefore art thou come
[50:43] then came they and laid hands on jesus
[50:48] and took him this was the thing that the
[50:52] chief priest
[50:53] scribes and the religious leaders of
[50:54] that day needed to facilitate what they
[50:57] wanted to do
[50:58] they were powerless to do anything
[51:00] because the scripture said he would be
[51:02] betrayed of one of his own
[51:04] and until one of his own came to them
[51:06] and coveted with them
[51:08] to do that very thing they were
[51:10] absolutely powerless
[51:12] they would try to do something to him
[51:13] he'd just walk through a wall they would
[51:15] try to stone him to death he'd just walk
[51:16] away
[51:17] just disappear but now
[51:21] the scriptural conditions that have been
[51:23] prophesied
[51:25] are laying in order and now
[51:28] the only thing that's changed
[51:32] the only thing that's changed from any
[51:34] of the prior events
[51:36] is now one of his own
[51:40] that walked with him that he called his
[51:43] own
[51:44] not one of his own one that he called
[51:45] his own he called him a
[51:48] friend within the framework of the true
[51:52] church
[51:55] judas was called a friend
[52:02] not by the disciples by god
[52:08] jesus himself said
[52:12] friend
[52:15] wherefore they'll come from
[52:20] the pattern's not going to change saints
[52:23] like it or don't like it
[52:25] the denominations are not going to be
[52:26] the one that disappoints you
[52:30] the rank and file message believers are
[52:33] not going to be the one that disappoints
[52:34] you
[52:36] it's going to be the one you call
[52:39] friend
[52:44] you say well then i just can't trust
[52:45] anybody
[52:48] why do you need to trust anybody
[52:51] why does it matter who you trust or who
[52:53] you don't trust
[52:55] the scripture is not going to waver
[52:58] the scripture is going to be fulfilled
[53:02] and if god has to hold our eyes to a
[53:05] judas among us
[53:06] so that the scriptures can be fulfilled
[53:08] praise god
[53:10] praise god until god tells me that's not
[53:13] my brother
[53:14] that's my brother until god tells me
[53:16] that's not my sister that's my sister
[53:19] until god tells me it's an enemy of god
[53:22] i'm going to call him friend
[53:26] and if god if god withholds my
[53:29] understanding
[53:31] and it makes me look like a fool at the
[53:32] end so be it
[53:35] it doesn't matter that i know everything
[53:37] and can discern everything
[53:39] what matters is the scripture progresses
[53:44] that's what matters so i don't need to
[53:46] live in tension and anxiety of who i can
[53:48] trust and who i can't trust
[53:51] trust them all the lamb said don't hurt
[53:54] my oil and wine
[53:56] it doesn't matter who i trust they can't
[53:58] hurt me unless he lets them hurt me
[54:01] call them friend call them brother
[54:04] don't worry about trying to understand
[54:06] what i'm saying i'm not saying we
[54:07] shouldn't use spiritual discernment
[54:09] but don't worry about getting hurt
[54:12] you're going to get hurt
[54:14] face the facts it's going to hurt
[54:19] bad
[54:22] way worse than you even anticipate
[54:26] mark my words not that my words mean
[54:28] anything it's just an expression
[54:30] i guarantee it it's going to be closer
[54:33] and it's going to hurt worse than you
[54:34] can even anticipate
[54:40] i guarantee that
[54:44] i guarantee that
[54:48] the re the appropriate response to that
[54:52] is to keep the fountain open keep the
[54:55] fountain open
[54:57] until he says turn off the fountain keep
[54:59] the fountain open
[55:01] if he's calling them friend right up
[55:03] until that time call him friend right up
[55:04] until that time
[55:06] let him identify who is who
[55:10] don't worry about the hurt that's coming
[55:12] you're going to get hurt there's nothing
[55:13] you can do to
[55:14] there's nothing you can do to stop it
[55:16] saints it has come and it's going to
[55:18] come
[55:18] it's going to get closer and closer and
[55:20] closer
[55:21] that's the negative the positives those
[55:25] that are really his
[55:26] are going to be closer and closer and
[55:28] closer and closer to you
[55:30] to the point you can chew their chewing
[55:31] gum that's close
[55:40] it's going to be close saints it's a
[55:42] condition laid in the scripture
[55:43] it's the only way the scriptures can
[55:45] advance
[55:47] don't worry about that be a brother
[55:51] be a sister be a friend let god reveal
[55:54] who is who
[55:56] it's not he's not going to reveal it too
[55:58] late
[56:00] he's not going to reveal it too late
[56:01] we'll know
[56:03] but we'll know at the appropriate time
[56:06] and we don't have to worry about them
[56:08] hurting us they are
[56:09] powerless they are
[56:13] powerless the lamb has already said
[56:16] hurt not the oil and wine they are
[56:20] powerless anything that they can and
[56:23] will and have done
[56:25] is because the lamb has approved it
[56:29] and if he's approved it i approve it and
[56:31] if he's approved it i say be it unto me
[56:33] according to your will
[56:35] according to your word because i know
[56:36] whatever you're approving this for my
[56:38] good
[56:38] and i know whatever you're approving is
[56:40] for the advancement of this timepiece
[56:42] the going of the bride see we can pray
[56:46] for a body change all we want
[56:47] i've got news for you your body is not
[56:49] going to change tomorrow
[56:51] i'm going to get crucified over that i
[56:52] know but i'm just going to say it anyhow
[56:55] i have got a list of scriptures and a
[56:56] list of quotes that have not been
[56:58] fulfilled
[56:58] your atoms are not changing tomorrow
[57:01] it's not happening saints
[57:03] it is not happening the words of the
[57:06] prophet
[57:07] are not going to fail because we are
[57:09] begrudging our extended stay
[57:12] the words of the prophet and the
[57:13] scriptures are not going to change
[57:15] because we're uncomfortable
[57:17] the words of the prophet and the things
[57:18] that he has prophesied and what lays in
[57:20] the scripture
[57:21] is not going to change because we want
[57:23] to whine about things
[57:25] we are a chosen elect group of people to
[57:28] stand here in satan's eating
[57:30] and fight face a politically backed
[57:33] persecution with physical consequences
[57:37] and until we do that our atoms are not
[57:40] changing
[57:41] we have got to get praise the lord
[57:44] we have got to get out of that mindset
[57:49] i have heard that preach for years and
[57:51] years and years and years
[57:53] to where where children are in i mean
[57:56] when i was in
[57:57] first and second third grade i'm like
[57:58] you know fourth grade what's the matter
[58:00] my atoms are going to be changing that's
[58:03] not true now i understand there was
[58:05] revelation withheld from that generation
[58:07] because it wasn't time yet
[58:08] but that's not the time we live in
[58:11] brother branham says that god couldn't
[58:12] release
[58:13] all his truth to those church age
[58:15] dispensations
[58:16] because if they knew what time it really
[58:19] was
[58:19] it would it would release them from all
[58:21] tensions and
[58:23] and looking for his coming and they
[58:25] would not
[58:26] operate appropriately you understand we
[58:28] do not
[58:29] operate under a church age anointing we
[58:32] operate under a bride anointing and the
[58:34] bride will know what time it is
[58:36] and the what time it is does not dictate
[58:39] our relationship to jesus christ
[58:41] what dictates our relationship to jesus
[58:43] christ is divine love
[58:45] so it doesn't matter whether things are
[58:47] good being prophesied or things are bad
[58:49] being prophesied
[58:50] or what is to come or what has come that
[58:52] does not change my relationship
[58:54] my relationship and my conduct is based
[58:57] on my divine love to him
[58:59] period and just because he tells me my
[59:03] body is not going to change
[59:05] for a little while longer it does not
[59:07] change how i operate
[59:09] that is not the age that we live in this
[59:12] bride is going to be able to operate
[59:14] under knowing what time it is what's
[59:16] coming her way
[59:17] and be perfectly fine with that if
[59:20] you're looking for an easy way out and
[59:21] you're adam's to change before you face
[59:23] persecution you better get out now
[59:25] because it's not going to happen and
[59:27] that is not the anointing for this
[59:29] people
[59:30] this anointing for this people is to
[59:32] know exactly what's going on
[59:34] and exactly what they're coming to and
[59:37] be okay with the fact that i'm not going
[59:39] to have an easy way out
[59:42] we don't live in the days of well praise
[59:45] god the rapture is going to be tomorrow
[59:47] let me rephrase that your body change is
[59:50] going to be tomorrow
[59:51] your body change is going to be tomorrow
[59:52] we don't live in that age anymore saints
[59:55] it is not okay to preach that it is
[59:58] wrong
[59:58] it is wrong according it is wrong
[1:00:01] according to what the prophet and the
[1:00:03] scriptures say
[1:00:05] i may get crucified about that i don't
[1:00:07] care it's the truth
[1:00:09] the scriptures and what the pro we are
[1:00:11] not going to leave here with 90 percent
[1:00:13] of what the profit is said to come to
[1:00:15] pass
[1:00:16] being being brought to pass and 10
[1:00:18] percent not
[1:00:20] it's not going to happen either he was
[1:00:22] god's prophet and everything he said is
[1:00:24] going to come to pass
[1:00:25] or he wasn't god's prophet we can't just
[1:00:28] lay
[1:00:29] lay and shuffle away the bad things and
[1:00:31] say oh well our bodies will change
[1:00:32] before that old bodies will change
[1:00:34] before that
[1:00:35] it's not going to work it's been
[1:00:38] prophesied it has to be done
[1:00:40] and there is a people on the face of the
[1:00:42] earth that are okay with that
[1:00:44] you may call me crazy but i do not want
[1:00:46] my atoms to change tomorrow
[1:00:49] that's ludicrous to say that it's
[1:00:51] absolutely ludicrous
[1:00:53] but what's more important to me than my
[1:00:55] adam's changing and me having it good
[1:00:57] is seeing the scriptures fulfilled and i
[1:01:01] i do not want to face him on that day
[1:01:02] and say i wimped out on him
[1:01:04] or that i took an easy way out i want to
[1:01:07] look at him and say i am
[1:01:08] thankful that you told me what day and
[1:01:10] what hour and what was coming
[1:01:12] and that you gave me grace and gave me
[1:01:14] strength to overcome that and to stand
[1:01:16] in that adversity
[1:01:18] and i did not shirk back from that
[1:01:20] responsibility and i did not look for an
[1:01:22] easy way out
[1:01:24] i want to be able to say it say i'm
[1:01:26] thankful that your prophet told me these
[1:01:28] things were coming
[1:01:29] and i'm thankful you gave me grace not
[1:01:31] to shirk from them and i'm thankful that
[1:01:32] you gave me the ability to stand on
[1:01:34] everything that he said and not just the
[1:01:36] good things
[1:01:38] i don't want to face him as a coward and
[1:01:40] i don't want to
[1:01:41] preach false doctrine that your atoms
[1:01:43] are going to change tomorrow
[1:01:44] when there are quotes and scriptures
[1:01:46] that have not been fulfilled
[1:01:48] now i will disclaim this by saying this
[1:01:51] one
[1:01:52] thing
[1:01:55] that brother branham has said things
[1:01:59] that will transpire
[1:02:00] and i am not going to put a timeline on
[1:02:02] that
[1:02:05] it can happen very very very very
[1:02:08] quickly
[1:02:11] very quickly so when i say your atoms
[1:02:15] are not going to change tomorrow i'm not
[1:02:16] going to put a 24-hour period on that
[1:02:21] i will say this until everything
[1:02:24] that the prophet has said is to
[1:02:27] transpire
[1:02:29] your atoms are not changing
[1:02:34] and you are in direct control of that
[1:02:37] because nothing can transpire until you
[1:02:41] give him preeminence
[1:02:43] and when you give him preeminence things
[1:02:46] can transpire
[1:02:47] very very very quickly
[1:02:53] but the things that the prophet has said
[1:02:56] we have to get comfortable with the fact
[1:02:57] that there is a
[1:02:58] timeline for those things to occur and
[1:03:01] all of those things are not going to
[1:03:02] occur in the next 24-hour saints it's
[1:03:04] just not going to happen
[1:03:06] it is not going to happen brother
[1:03:09] branham was so in tune with this
[1:03:11] and brother branham was okay with this i
[1:03:13] can show you the quote he says you know
[1:03:15] what
[1:03:16] i've got ahead of the timeline he says
[1:03:19] i have to pull back a little bit because
[1:03:21] these things over here have to catch up
[1:03:25] if he's comfortable and he's okay with
[1:03:27] doing that why can't we be
[1:03:31] why can't we be why can't we be
[1:03:34] comfortable with the fact that our atoms
[1:03:36] are not
[1:03:36] that we are so in tune with god that we
[1:03:40] know our atoms are not going to change
[1:03:42] tomorrow because his
[1:03:43] word here here and here has not been
[1:03:46] fulfilled
[1:03:49] if we know the truth what's wrong with
[1:03:52] preaching the truth
[1:03:54] why do we need to cuddle people and tell
[1:03:56] them just hang on a little bit longer
[1:03:57] your atoms will change
[1:03:58] just stick around just tough it out a
[1:04:00] little bit more just hang in there
[1:04:02] hang in there hang on your atoms are
[1:04:03] going to change just any time just any
[1:04:05] time you're out it's going to change
[1:04:07] since that's not what we're called to
[1:04:08] operate under
[1:04:10] if my atoms don't change and i die of an
[1:04:12] old age it doesn't matter how i'm going
[1:04:13] to operate
[1:04:14] i'm going to operate in divine love and
[1:04:17] preeminence towards god
[1:04:20] and if he sees fit to change my atoms
[1:04:23] then he sees fit to do that i believe
[1:04:24] that with all my heart that that's my
[1:04:26] calling
[1:04:26] i believe that with all my heart i am
[1:04:28] called to have a to
[1:04:29] experience the physical change of the
[1:04:32] body i believe that with all my heart
[1:04:34] but i'm not going to whine to god and
[1:04:35] tell him that he has to do that before
[1:04:37] all these things are fulfilled
[1:04:38] but what i will tell you is this
[1:04:42] when i face a physical
[1:04:46] politically backed persecution
[1:04:51] his ears are going to be ringing about
[1:04:53] my body change
[1:04:57] i guarantee you i'm going to be a
[1:05:00] squeaky wheel then
[1:05:02] and i'm going to get some grease
[1:05:05] because when that transpires
[1:05:08] he has no scripture to stand on
[1:05:12] you understand what i'm saying it's not
[1:05:14] like i'm arguing with god he has
[1:05:16] nothing to hold that he has nothing to
[1:05:19] hold that
[1:05:20] and the only thing that can hold that is
[1:05:22] his scripture
[1:05:24] so when his scripture has been fulfilled
[1:05:27] i will join you in the whining and the
[1:05:30] crying
[1:05:31] and and anything else that we can come
[1:05:34] up with
[1:05:36] but until then i am not going to insult
[1:05:39] god by trying and
[1:05:42] preaching something is going to happen
[1:05:46] when he has already vindicated a prophet
[1:05:48] and said
[1:05:49] these things must happen
[1:05:52] before your atoms change and he may not
[1:05:55] said that directly but he lays those
[1:05:57] things in there so that we can see those
[1:05:59] see brother branham even the age that
[1:06:02] brother branham was in
[1:06:03] wasn't the age we're in they couldn't
[1:06:05] handle that
[1:06:08] you think for a minute what people
[1:06:12] were standing with the prophet towards
[1:06:14] the end of his ministry
[1:06:15] would still have been around if he told
[1:06:18] them since
[1:06:19] it's going to be 2020 and we're still
[1:06:21] going to be here
[1:06:24] you talk about whittling a crowd down
[1:06:28] see he couldn't even release that in his
[1:06:31] time
[1:06:32] that's how close we are saints is now
[1:06:36] god knows there is a people with the
[1:06:39] character that he's looking for on this
[1:06:42] earth
[1:06:42] that he can literally tell them what
[1:06:45] time it is
[1:06:46] exactly and he knows that they won't try
[1:06:49] to alter the program or take an easy way
[1:06:51] out
[1:06:53] they will be comfortable knowing there
[1:06:56] is a politically backed persecution
[1:06:58] coming my way
[1:06:59] and i do not want my atoms to change
[1:07:02] until then
[1:07:03] because that is my calling
[1:07:06] my calling and purpose is to withstand
[1:07:10] that persecution
[1:07:12] by standing on the truth and by giving
[1:07:14] him preeminence
[1:07:16] and overcoming that
[1:07:20] and and delivering the final blow to the
[1:07:24] final
[1:07:24] to the final battle that's my calling
[1:07:28] what just think about this
[1:07:32] how awful who how many wants to live
[1:07:34] through eternity
[1:07:35] i think we would all say we want to live
[1:07:37] through eternity
[1:07:39] how awful would it be to live through
[1:07:42] eternity
[1:07:43] knowing that you had one little blip
[1:07:46] in eternity one little blip called tom
[1:07:50] and during that one little tiny blip of
[1:07:53] time
[1:07:55] you couldn't even do what he wanted you
[1:07:57] to do
[1:07:59] the all you had to do was whine and cry
[1:08:02] about how you wanted to get back into
[1:08:03] eternity
[1:08:06] and now you've got to spend eternity
[1:08:08] knowing
[1:08:10] that i chickened out on god
[1:08:14] now how many wants to spend eternity
[1:08:16] like that
[1:08:18] spend eternity knowing you went out on
[1:08:22] god
[1:08:22] he just wanted one thing he just wanted
[1:08:25] one thing
[1:08:26] and he was so kind and so gracious
[1:08:29] to tell us exactly how it was going to
[1:08:33] transpire
[1:08:34] and exactly when it was going to
[1:08:37] transpire
[1:08:39] brother branham says no man the
[1:08:41] scripture says no man knoweth the day
[1:08:43] nor the hour
[1:08:45] brother branham came and he says he
[1:08:47] didn't say you couldn't know
[1:08:49] the week the month or the year
[1:08:56] so what if i tell you that for the next
[1:08:58] five years we are going to face
[1:09:00] an intense onslaught of politically
[1:09:04] backed demonic
[1:09:06] forces what does it matter
[1:09:12] what does it matter it's been prophesied
[1:09:16] it has to be done
[1:09:19] see that's the character he's looking
[1:09:22] for
[1:09:22] is he's not wanting somebody to serve
[1:09:25] him based on the conditions
[1:09:29] he's wanting somebody to serve him
[1:09:31] because of who he is
[1:09:33] you recall i can't remember his name
[1:09:36] right off the bat
[1:09:38] but it was the servant that spit on
[1:09:40] david
[1:09:43] the one that would serve david when it
[1:09:46] was pleasurable to serve david
[1:09:48] and would spit on him when it wasn't so
[1:09:50] convenient
[1:09:55] god forbid we would ever be like that
[1:09:59] that's not our age that's not our
[1:10:01] anointing that is not who we are
[1:10:04] we are called to serve him because of
[1:10:06] who he is
[1:10:07] and what he has done for us period
[1:10:10] and be joyful in doing it
[1:10:16] that's the anointing that's released to
[1:10:17] us that's the character that he's
[1:10:19] looking for
[1:10:20] and he knows i believe that with all my
[1:10:22] heart he knows
[1:10:24] that there is a people now capable
[1:10:27] with that character of living under that
[1:10:31] truth
[1:10:32] and under that anointing they are
[1:10:34] comfortable
[1:10:36] living and serving him not for what they
[1:10:39] can get
[1:10:39] but for what but for who he is
[1:10:42] regardless of where the timeline
[1:10:44] is he can reveal that timeline to them
[1:10:48] so accurately and let them know exactly
[1:10:51] what's coming ahead
[1:10:52] and it doesn't waver their preeminence
[1:10:54] to him
[1:10:55] there's a reason these things can be
[1:10:56] preached now saints is because there's a
[1:10:58] people to hear him and there's a people
[1:10:59] to believe him and i know i'm not the
[1:11:01] only one
[1:11:03] i know i'm not the only one
[1:11:07] that's ludicrous to say that i don't
[1:11:08] want my atoms to change right now
[1:11:10] but i don't because i want to
[1:11:13] fulfill the scripture because this
[1:11:16] scripture is me and what he said about
[1:11:19] me i've got to do
[1:11:20] there's nothing that can change that
[1:11:22] that's what i want to do
[1:11:23] and i believe the adam's changing is a
[1:11:25] portion of that scripture
[1:11:26] but in order to get to that point to get
[1:11:28] to the climax of the going
[1:11:30] i've got to go through the process and
[1:11:32] i'm going to be joyful about that
[1:11:34] process
[1:11:35] i didn't say i was going to enjoy it i
[1:11:36] said i'm going to be joyful about that
[1:11:38] process
[1:11:39] during that process praise the lord
[1:11:44] condition number three is to be betrayed
[1:11:48] by friends
[1:11:51] like it or not it's already in the
[1:11:54] scripture
[1:11:54] matthew 26 51
[1:11:58] and behold one of them which were with
[1:12:00] jesus stretched out his hand and drew
[1:12:01] his sword and struck a servant of the
[1:12:03] high priest and smote off his ear
[1:12:05] then jesus said unto him put up thy
[1:12:07] sword unto its place
[1:12:08] for all they that take the sword shall
[1:12:10] perish with the sword
[1:12:11] thinketh now that i cannot pray to my
[1:12:13] father and he shall presently give me
[1:12:15] more than 12 legions of angels
[1:12:17] but how then shall the scriptures be
[1:12:20] fulfilled
[1:12:21] that thus it must be
[1:12:26] condition number four is you fight
[1:12:29] back with no orders to do so from the
[1:12:34] captain
[1:12:37] fighting back with
[1:12:41] no orders to do so from the captain if
[1:12:44] the captain gives the orders to fight
[1:12:45] back
[1:12:46] it's totally different you remember when
[1:12:49] brother branham was facing the chicago
[1:12:51] ministerial association he says oh well
[1:12:53] that's easy i just won't go down there
[1:12:57] that was the appropriate response
[1:13:01] but then the captain came
[1:13:05] he says no you go i'll be with you
[1:13:08] now it's totally different now it's no
[1:13:12] holds barred
[1:13:13] now it's take no prisoners because the
[1:13:16] captain has said go
[1:13:17] but until the captain says go you can't
[1:13:20] fight back
[1:13:24] the reason they were in this condition
[1:13:26] the reason peter was in this condition
[1:13:30] is because of condition number two
[1:13:33] he failed to keep dedicated prayer time
[1:13:38] now a direct result
[1:13:41] of that was he found himself doing two
[1:13:45] things
[1:13:46] number one he was fighting back
[1:13:49] when he wasn't allowed to fight back
[1:13:53] he was actually fighting against
[1:13:56] the scriptures and number
[1:13:59] two he was fighting a spiritual warfare
[1:14:04] carnally
[1:14:09] he missed all of that
[1:14:12] because he didn't pray when god told him
[1:14:14] to pray
[1:14:18] how simple what consequences
[1:14:25] fighting against god is his scriptures
[1:14:28] we know
[1:14:29] he's fighting against god moving forward
[1:14:34] notice though now his motive
[1:14:37] and his objective were absolutely
[1:14:41] unadulterated
[1:14:44] snow white
[1:14:48] it doesn't matter what our motive and
[1:14:49] objective is if we're against the word
[1:14:52] brother branham says you can be
[1:14:53] sincerely wrong
[1:14:57] and the only way that you're going to
[1:14:58] make sure you're always right
[1:15:00] is if you meet condition number two
[1:15:05] dedicated prayer to god when he says
[1:15:08] pray
[1:15:10] in case you've missed it he's told us to
[1:15:12] be in prayer
[1:15:15] there's a reason he wants us to be in
[1:15:17] prayer
[1:15:19] oh here we go again i'm never going to
[1:15:22] finish
[1:15:24] jesus is in the garden with peter james
[1:15:27] and john
[1:15:28] and he says pray with me
[1:15:32] why did he want them to pray with him
[1:15:37] it was not going to change a single
[1:15:38] thing
[1:15:43] think about it i mean what what's he
[1:15:45] telling
[1:15:46] pray that i won't be crucified
[1:15:49] he already knows he's going to be
[1:15:50] crucified he's he don't want that
[1:15:53] in his flesh but he knows it's to be
[1:15:54] that's why he's praying thy will be done
[1:15:57] so you think he's going to tell his
[1:15:58] disciples go and pray that i don't have
[1:16:00] to go to the cross
[1:16:02] so why is he telling him to go and pray
[1:16:04] if it's not going to do any good for him
[1:16:10] same reason he wants us to pray when it
[1:16:11] don't do any good for us
[1:16:16] see prayer is not to change it
[1:16:21] prayer is not to change what's coming
[1:16:25] unless he's told you to pray to change
[1:16:26] what's coming
[1:16:28] that's a paradox i'm not even going to
[1:16:29] try to explain but it's possible
[1:16:33] but if he don't tell you to pray to
[1:16:35] change what's coming
[1:16:36] and he just tells you to pray he showed
[1:16:39] you how to pray
[1:16:41] let this cut passmanly but if not
[1:16:44] your will then let me drink it
[1:16:48] thy will be done see he came to them and
[1:16:51] he told them to pray
[1:16:53] not to change what was the scripture
[1:16:56] says was going to happen
[1:16:58] he told them to pray not so that it
[1:17:01] would be comfortable
[1:17:02] on them he told them to pray for one
[1:17:05] reason
[1:17:07] and that was so they would avoid
[1:17:09] condition number four
[1:17:11] [Music]
[1:17:12] fighting against the purpose and will of
[1:17:16] god with pure motive and pure objective
[1:17:23] he didn't tell them to pray to change
[1:17:25] their motive and objective
[1:17:28] that's not what he was after what he
[1:17:31] wanted to do
[1:17:33] was through dedicated prayer give
[1:17:36] them a proper understanding of
[1:17:40] where they were at and what was going to
[1:17:42] happen
[1:17:45] that's why he wanted them to pray not to
[1:17:47] change it
[1:17:50] he wanted them to pray so that they
[1:17:52] wouldn't be fighting against him
[1:17:55] or fighting a spiritual warfare carnally
[1:18:00] that's why he wanted them to pray he
[1:18:02] didn't want them to pray to
[1:18:04] change the conditions of the external
[1:18:07] forces
[1:18:08] he wanted them to pray to change the
[1:18:10] conditions of the internal forces
[1:18:13] he wanted them to pray to change
[1:18:15] themselves
[1:18:19] so now if they would have simply done
[1:18:22] what he
[1:18:22] told them to do they wouldn't have been
[1:18:25] fighting
[1:18:26] peter wouldn't have been fighting
[1:18:29] against the word of god
[1:18:31] and they would not have operated in fear
[1:18:34] when the multitude came
[1:18:38] if they would have just done what he
[1:18:40] told them to do
[1:18:42] when the multitude came they would have
[1:18:44] went down there to the council with him
[1:18:46] with no fear
[1:18:49] and they would not have been
[1:18:52] touched because that would have
[1:18:55] distracted from the glory of christ
[1:18:58] and that was not scriptural to begin
[1:19:00] with they didn't need to die for the
[1:19:02] sins of the world
[1:19:04] he did what a testimony
[1:19:08] one hour in prayer now gives me a proper
[1:19:11] understanding of where i'm at in time
[1:19:13] and what i'm to do and it alleviates me
[1:19:16] fighting a spiritual warfare carnally
[1:19:18] and that alleviates me from operating in
[1:19:22] fear
[1:19:25] we've seen what the results of
[1:19:28] not keeping that will do those two
[1:19:31] results that i just gave you are the
[1:19:33] conditions that will happen
[1:19:34] if you do do it you will know what time
[1:19:38] you're living in
[1:19:40] and you will not be operating in fear
[1:19:47] that's what we're called to
[1:19:50] that's what he wanted the disciples to
[1:19:52] do but they failed
[1:19:53] that's why when he came back to them he
[1:19:55] said sleep on you missed it
[1:19:57] all right let's go he that betrays me
[1:20:00] he's here
[1:20:03] he wasn't wanting them to pray to change
[1:20:07] the outcome of the external forces he
[1:20:10] was wanting them
[1:20:11] he wasn't even wanting them to pray so
[1:20:12] they know who judas was
[1:20:16] he showed him who judas was whenever it
[1:20:17] was fit to show him who judas was
[1:20:20] judah showed himself he was wanting them
[1:20:23] to pray for
[1:20:24] one thing i'm sorry for two things
[1:20:27] so that they would know what time they
[1:20:28] were living in and they wouldn't be
[1:20:30] fighting against the purpose and will of
[1:20:32] god
[1:20:32] and that they would not be operating in
[1:20:34] fear he wanted them to go down to that
[1:20:37] council with them
[1:20:38] and not deny him like a chicken before
[1:20:40] the chicken crowed
[1:20:43] that's what he was wanting and they
[1:20:46] could have done it
[1:20:47] and been totally untouchable
[1:20:51] totally untouchable but they were
[1:20:54] operating in fear
[1:20:55] from a lack of dedicated prayer and they
[1:20:58] missed
[1:20:59] their opportunity what a testimony
[1:21:04] just think about that for a second look
[1:21:07] at the testimony that's recorded in
[1:21:08] peter
[1:21:09] about peter
[1:21:13] and even the miraculous that was
[1:21:15] surrounding it
[1:21:17] i'm the guy that cut the high priesteer
[1:21:18] off because i was trying to chop his
[1:21:20] head off
[1:21:20] i cut his ear off jesus picked it up put
[1:21:22] it back on and healed it
[1:21:23] oh my goodness hallelujah pentecostal
[1:21:26] revival
[1:21:28] totally missed the point all the signs
[1:21:32] and wonders and miracles surrounding
[1:21:33] that
[1:21:33] and it totally missed the point
[1:21:36] what if peter could go back in time
[1:21:39] hypothetically speaking
[1:21:41] and given another chance do you not
[1:21:43] think his testimony and his will would
[1:21:46] want to be the one
[1:21:49] i prayed when jesus told me to pray
[1:21:52] and you know what i did when multitude
[1:21:54] came and got him
[1:21:56] i laid down my sword because he never
[1:21:58] told me to fight
[1:22:01] i'm the one me i'm the one
[1:22:04] who walked down into the council with
[1:22:08] him
[1:22:10] and i wasn't scared and i knew they
[1:22:13] couldn't touch me
[1:22:14] because i'd done what he told me to do
[1:22:16] and i had a revelation that i was
[1:22:18] untouchable
[1:22:22] if peter had to do it again which do you
[1:22:25] think he would do
[1:22:29] which are you going to do
[1:22:34] which are you going to do what am i
[1:22:36] going to do
[1:22:37] that's the testimony i want i
[1:22:40] operated knowing what day and hour i
[1:22:42] lived in and i did not operate out of
[1:22:44] fear i operated out of
[1:22:46] love and preeminence
[1:22:49] praise the lord matthew 26 30
[1:22:54] and when they had sang a hymn so this is
[1:22:56] after the last supper and when they had
[1:22:57] sang a hymn
[1:22:58] they went out into the mount of olives
[1:23:03] then jesus saith unto them all ye
[1:23:07] i'm sorry i've skipped something here
[1:23:09] i'm sorry yes
[1:23:11] sorry to confuse you so this was the
[1:23:14] last supper before he went to the garden
[1:23:15] before the multitude came and got him
[1:23:18] the reason that i had to bring this out
[1:23:20] of out of order
[1:23:21] is because this ties directly to
[1:23:24] condition number four
[1:23:28] so let's read this portion and then i'm
[1:23:30] gonna go back sorry if this
[1:23:31] confuses you but just stay with me so
[1:23:34] this is at the last supper
[1:23:37] before he goes to the garden and asks
[1:23:39] them to pray
[1:23:40] and when they had sang in him they went
[1:23:42] out into the mount of olives then jesus
[1:23:43] saith unto them
[1:23:44] all ye shall be offended because of me
[1:23:46] this night for it is written i will
[1:23:48] smite the shepherd
[1:23:49] and the sheep of the flock will be
[1:23:51] scattered abroad
[1:23:53] jesus has already told them what's going
[1:23:55] to happen
[1:23:57] you think that's not going to come to
[1:24:00] pass
[1:24:02] but after i am risen again i will go
[1:24:04] before you unto galilee
[1:24:05] peter answered and said unto him though
[1:24:07] all men shall be offended because of
[1:24:09] thee
[1:24:09] yet will i never be offended jesus said
[1:24:12] unto him verily i say unto
[1:24:13] thee this night before the crow
[1:24:15] thou shalt deny me thrice
[1:24:17] peter saith unto him though i should die
[1:24:19] with thee yet will i
[1:24:21] not deny thee likewise also saith all
[1:24:23] the disciples
[1:24:25] skipping to verse 56 chapter 24.
[1:24:31] so that was right before they went to
[1:24:33] the garden which is the topic we just
[1:24:35] discussed
[1:24:37] then we had the period of the garden and
[1:24:39] what transpired there
[1:24:41] the multitude came and got them with
[1:24:42] swords and staves
[1:24:44] and now we come to verse 56
[1:24:47] speaking of all of this that's just
[1:24:49] happened and it says
[1:24:51] but all of this was done that the
[1:24:53] scriptures of the prophets might be
[1:24:54] fulfilled
[1:24:56] then all of the disciples
[1:24:59] forsook him and fled
[1:25:06] funny what he said was going to happen
[1:25:10] happened imagine that
[1:25:14] he told them this was going to happen
[1:25:17] and it happened this is condition number
[1:25:21] five
[1:25:23] in the pattern of the going
[1:25:27] smiting of a shepherd scattering of
[1:25:30] sheep
[1:25:33] smiting of a shepherd scattering of
[1:25:36] sheep
[1:25:38] and the inability to bear the offense
[1:25:43] of the shepherd
[1:25:46] the inability
[1:25:50] to bear the offense of the true shepherd
[1:25:56] it's in the scriptures it's not going to
[1:26:00] change
[1:26:01] the patterns there it has to repeat
[1:26:06] there will be the inability
[1:26:09] to bear the offense of a
[1:26:12] true shepherd may i say a true ministry
[1:26:18] the inability to bear that offense
[1:26:22] and that in turn
[1:26:25] relays into the smiting of a shepherd
[1:26:29] and the scattering of sheep
[1:26:32] because it's fine to stick with the
[1:26:33] ministry when everybody loves the
[1:26:35] ministry
[1:26:38] but what if a certain individual says
[1:26:40] that ministry is
[1:26:41] just a little you know
[1:26:45] just a little sideways
[1:26:48] is there an ability to stand
[1:26:52] with a true ministry
[1:26:56] that conditions their saints we better
[1:26:58] not miss it
[1:27:00] a true ministry speaking the true word
[1:27:04] of god
[1:27:06] a smitten shepherd
[1:27:09] scattered sheep it's a condition
[1:27:13] of the going of the bride when you see
[1:27:16] that condition
[1:27:18] it's a flashing red light of what time
[1:27:21] you're in
[1:27:23] the inability to bear an offense
[1:27:26] associated with a true ministry
[1:27:28] associated with a true shepherd
[1:27:31] flashing red light flashing red light
[1:27:37] can we bear christ's reproach
[1:27:40] they couldn't bear it in that day can we
[1:27:42] bear his reproach
[1:27:44] how are we going to bear his reproach in
[1:27:46] this day
[1:27:48] is because the form that he has chosen
[1:27:51] to come in
[1:27:52] is going to be an offense
[1:27:56] your brother and your sister is going to
[1:27:59] be
[1:28:00] an offense and you are going to have to
[1:28:03] make the decision
[1:28:05] you all thought i was just talking about
[1:28:06] a pulpit ministry didn't you
[1:28:09] oh no no no no no no
[1:28:12] that's the preliminary stuff that's not
[1:28:15] even the real stuff
[1:28:17] that just shows their callers real quick
[1:28:20] what about your brother and your sister
[1:28:24] what if you're in jail together and they
[1:28:26] say oh you're associated with this one
[1:28:28] that we brought in the lunatic
[1:28:30] who believes the guy from like 1950s or
[1:28:32] whatever is
[1:28:34] he still he still plays tapes of that
[1:28:36] guy
[1:28:37] you're associated with him oh you're
[1:28:41] associated with the god that says i
[1:28:43] and my father are one you're associated
[1:28:45] with him
[1:28:48] yeah the inability
[1:28:51] to bear the offense
[1:28:55] associated with a true ministry pulpit
[1:28:58] or not pulpit
[1:29:03] that's a condition of the going
[1:29:06] we should be thankful we see that
[1:29:08] condition because it means
[1:29:10] we're going we've we're
[1:29:13] well beyond the corner we've turned the
[1:29:16] corner
[1:29:17] we're going
[1:29:20] most of these things that i'm speaking
[1:29:22] here have already
[1:29:24] we've already seen them saints we've
[1:29:25] already seen them we've already
[1:29:27] experienced them
[1:29:28] we're currently seeing them and
[1:29:29] currently experiencing them
[1:29:31] there's one thing we'll get to the end
[1:29:32] that's you know
[1:29:34] not there yet but no doubts it's it's
[1:29:37] happening
[1:29:40] that's condition number five that we
[1:29:42] will not get away from
[1:29:43] we're going to have to make a decision
[1:29:45] about that
[1:29:47] not just in a pulpit your brother and
[1:29:50] your sister
[1:29:53] can you bear their offense can you bear
[1:29:55] the offense associated with them
[1:29:58] there's much i could say there much i
[1:30:01] could say
[1:30:04] there's things that are happening with
[1:30:06] our brothers and sisters
[1:30:08] that are only going to increase
[1:30:11] and they are going to be absolutely
[1:30:14] wonderful to the bride
[1:30:15] and they are going to be absolutely
[1:30:17] offensive
[1:30:18] to those around the bride i did not say
[1:30:22] the denominations i said to those
[1:30:24] around the bride
[1:30:30] it will be wonderful to the bride it
[1:30:33] will be offensive
[1:30:34] to those around the bride
[1:30:37] we're very familiar with that quote
[1:30:40] where brother branham says when you come
[1:30:42] to say
[1:30:43] i and my father are one then the shock
[1:30:46] will pull away
[1:30:48] we've seen preliminary things of that
[1:30:50] sure we've not seen that in fullness
[1:30:54] but when christ really starts to
[1:30:56] manifest himself
[1:30:58] not from the pulpit from the laity
[1:31:02] that's where he's trying to get saints
[1:31:04] that's been his goal all along in case
[1:31:05] you've missed it
[1:31:06] is not to have a good preacher
[1:31:09] his purpose and his goal is to have
[1:31:12] preeminence
[1:31:13] in a people and when that starts to
[1:31:17] transpire in the fullness
[1:31:19] of its power it will be absolutely
[1:31:22] wonderful to the bride and it will be an
[1:31:25] absolute offense to the people
[1:31:27] that's possibly sitting right next to
[1:31:29] them
[1:31:31] and you're going to have to make a
[1:31:34] choice
[1:31:36] are you going to be smitten and
[1:31:37] scattered or are you going to bear the
[1:31:40] offense
[1:31:40] of a true ministry
[1:31:44] that may have never got behind the
[1:31:45] pulpit in a day in their life
[1:31:49] but is ministering the living
[1:31:52] bleeding bloody word of god
[1:31:56] don't shirk away from that offense
[1:32:00] so i hopefully you can see now how that
[1:32:02] tied back into what uh
[1:32:04] what i said before matthew 26
[1:32:08] 59 now the chief priest and the elders
[1:32:12] and all the council sought false
[1:32:15] witnesses against jesus to put him to
[1:32:17] death
[1:32:18] but found none yea though many false
[1:32:20] witnesses came yet found they none
[1:32:22] at the last came two false witnesses
[1:32:26] and said this fellow saith i am able to
[1:32:29] destroy the temple of god and to build
[1:32:30] in three days
[1:32:33] and the high priest arose and said unto
[1:32:34] him answer us thou
[1:32:36] nothing what is it which these
[1:32:39] witness against thee but jesus held his
[1:32:42] peace
[1:32:43] and the high priest answered and said
[1:32:45] unto him i adjure thee
[1:32:47] by the living god
[1:32:54] oh praise the lord
[1:32:58] i almost wish he would have been
[1:32:59] cardinal for just one second
[1:33:01] just just someone said oh me i'm sorry
[1:33:04] i thought you said my name
[1:33:08] high priest the religious leader i'm
[1:33:10] invoking you
[1:33:12] i'm enduring you by yourself tell me who
[1:33:15] you are
[1:33:18] what what blindness how sorrowful
[1:33:22] condition how sorrowful
[1:33:26] tell us whether thou be the christ the
[1:33:28] son of god
[1:33:29] jesus saith unto him thou hast said
[1:33:32] nevertheless i say unto you hereafter
[1:33:34] shall ye see the son of man sitting on
[1:33:36] the right hand of power
[1:33:37] and coming in the clouds of heaven then
[1:33:40] the high priest rent his clothes
[1:33:42] saying he hath spoken blasphemy i'll
[1:33:44] just interject this real quick
[1:33:46] when the high priest rent his clothes it
[1:33:48] wasn't just a sign he was mad
[1:33:50] this was actually a sign of a changing
[1:33:52] of the priesthood if you'll go back
[1:33:54] i'm sure many of you are familiar with
[1:33:55] that if you go back and look at that
[1:33:56] through the old testament
[1:33:57] when the high priest was forbidden to
[1:33:58] rent his clothes and when he did that
[1:34:00] changes the priesthood
[1:34:02] so i just want to throw that in there
[1:34:03] real quick you can go back and study
[1:34:04] that if you would like so this is
[1:34:06] there's a lot in those words
[1:34:10] watch what immediately preceded that
[1:34:14] jesus told him who he was and when he
[1:34:17] told
[1:34:18] them who it was it caused a reaction
[1:34:19] that by default
[1:34:22] changed the priesthood
[1:34:25] so that's just a side note i don't want
[1:34:26] to go down that trail but it's it's
[1:34:29] very relevant saying he hath spoken
[1:34:32] blasphemy
[1:34:33] what further need have we of witnesses
[1:34:35] behold
[1:34:36] now ye have heard his blasphemy
[1:34:40] what thank ye they answered and said
[1:34:43] he is guilty of death
[1:34:47] what do you think is going to happen
[1:34:48] when you say i and my father are one
[1:34:52] i don't think i really need to expound
[1:34:53] much on that
[1:34:55] but condition number six was they're
[1:34:59] going to bring false
[1:35:00] witnesses they're going to hunt them
[1:35:03] down
[1:35:04] they're going to make sure they have at
[1:35:06] least two false witnesses
[1:35:09] and even when those witnesses aren't any
[1:35:11] good they're going to find you guilty of
[1:35:13] death anyhow
[1:35:16] but they are going to have false
[1:35:18] witnesses
[1:35:19] and they are going to accuse you of
[1:35:21] blasphemy
[1:35:25] i'm not talking about the denominations
[1:35:32] there will be false witnesses there will
[1:35:35] be accusations of blasphemy
[1:35:39] in the framework of the true church
[1:35:45] praise the lord matthew 26 67
[1:35:52] then did they spit in his face
[1:35:55] and buffeted him and others smote him
[1:35:58] with the palms of their hands saying
[1:36:00] prophesy unto us thou christ who is he
[1:36:03] that smote thee condition number seven
[1:36:06] is the
[1:36:07] opportunity and the temptation
[1:36:10] to misuse your power because at this
[1:36:14] point in time
[1:36:15] you will have it
[1:36:18] in its fullness
[1:36:23] in its fullness at this point in the
[1:36:26] timeline
[1:36:27] you will have it
[1:36:32] and the condition that you will be met
[1:36:34] with
[1:36:35] is the opportunity to misuse it
[1:36:40] at the in opportune time
[1:36:48] it's a very very powerful situation to
[1:36:50] be in
[1:36:52] and there's examples through the
[1:36:53] scriptures that we can bring up and show
[1:36:54] that that's there
[1:36:57] but just because you have the power
[1:36:59] doesn't mean you can use the power
[1:37:02] the same character that released that
[1:37:05] power to you
[1:37:06] must be the same character that you
[1:37:08] operated by
[1:37:09] and that's why i say you'll have it
[1:37:13] because jesus couldn't
[1:37:17] have been tempted with an opportunity
[1:37:20] to do something he didn't have the power
[1:37:23] to do anyhow
[1:37:27] he had the power at this time he had the
[1:37:31] opportunity
[1:37:32] the temptation was to misuse it
[1:37:38] you and i will face this same thing
[1:37:43] and thank god we are predestinated
[1:37:47] not to fail
[1:37:51] thank god for his grace
[1:37:55] that we are predestinated not to mess
[1:37:58] that up
[1:37:59] because i don't know about you i know
[1:38:01] about me
[1:38:03] and i guarantee you i would mess it up
[1:38:11] i'm saying the condition that i'm in now
[1:38:13] i would mess it up
[1:38:15] when i'm in that condition that's
[1:38:17] released to me
[1:38:18] i know i'll be incapable of messing it
[1:38:20] up because he's
[1:38:21] not going to release that to a character
[1:38:24] that can misuse it
[1:38:26] you say well what about elijah and the
[1:38:27] she bears elijah did not have the
[1:38:29] fullness of this saints
[1:38:31] no no no no we will have a more
[1:38:35] we will have more than what he had
[1:38:38] we will have what he had plus
[1:38:43] we will have a better character than he
[1:38:46] had
[1:38:49] you understand he did that because of
[1:38:51] flaw in his character
[1:38:54] brother brahm said it was an angry
[1:38:56] prophet the scripture says be angry
[1:38:58] and sin not
[1:39:01] it was powerful demonstration powerful
[1:39:04] demonstration
[1:39:06] i was wanting to use it yesterday
[1:39:08] because i was in a church
[1:39:10] i kid you not they were doing a funeral
[1:39:13] service
[1:39:13] and they used a curse word over the
[1:39:16] pulpit
[1:39:18] and said well it's okay for me to do
[1:39:19] that in the church because i'm just
[1:39:20] quoting what another person said about
[1:39:22] this guy
[1:39:24] i'm wanting some she bears saints i'm
[1:39:26] not going to lie i'm looking for some
[1:39:27] she-bears
[1:39:30] curse word over the pulpit
[1:39:33] and what was what was worse than the
[1:39:35] people laughing back
[1:39:37] is the minister sat there and allowed it
[1:39:39] it wasn't a message church just so
[1:39:42] just so you could calm down it wasn't a
[1:39:43] message church
[1:39:45] very carnal denominational church but
[1:39:47] just look at where they've got to saints
[1:39:52] curse word over the pulpit the
[1:39:53] congregation laughed he said it's okay
[1:39:55] to do it in church because i'm quoting
[1:39:56] what this guy said about my father
[1:39:58] and the minister allowed it
[1:40:03] like i said i'm not going to lie i'm
[1:40:04] looking for some she bears
[1:40:09] utter repulsive even in a you know
[1:40:11] brother brandon said they're just lodges
[1:40:13] we understand we have that revelation
[1:40:15] but just just if you look at it carnally
[1:40:18] it's a house of worship it's a pulpit
[1:40:20] and the conscience is so
[1:40:22] seared that you can do that
[1:40:25] tell me not tell me judgment's not ant
[1:40:29] god's not going to wink at that forever
[1:40:33] the opportunity and temptation to misuse
[1:40:36] power
[1:40:37] matthew 27 verse 1.
[1:40:42] so i'm an hour and a half in and i'm
[1:40:44] just now getting where i wanted to get
[1:40:46] so should i have you stand up and do
[1:40:48] jumping jacks they there's a study
[1:40:50] there's a study that says you can only
[1:40:52] keep people's attention for 50 hours in
[1:40:54] a sitting
[1:40:55] so if i have you all stand up and sit
[1:40:59] back down
[1:41:00] i get 50 more minutes right of your
[1:41:03] attention
[1:41:06] you can do that if you feel to do that
[1:41:08] nobody will look at you weirdly
[1:41:12] i just wanted to break that spirit just
[1:41:13] a minute because i really want you to
[1:41:14] concentrate on what's coming next here
[1:41:17] this is where i wanted to get so these
[1:41:20] are the conditions that
[1:41:22] led up to the very final
[1:41:25] climax of the going everything that
[1:41:27] we've
[1:41:28] we've touched on so far
[1:41:32] there's seven conditions i didn't make
[1:41:34] that up there was just seven conditions
[1:41:35] i don't know maybe there's a doctrine
[1:41:37] that i should be spiritual and catch
[1:41:38] behind that
[1:41:39] um just the way that it worked out that
[1:41:41] that's what i saw
[1:41:42] maybe there's i'm sure there's more than
[1:41:43] that that's just all that i saw there
[1:41:47] but now we come to the climax
[1:41:51] now we come to the purpose and the
[1:41:54] climax
[1:41:55] of the going matthew 27 verse 1 and when
[1:41:59] the morning was come
[1:42:01] all the chief priests and the elders of
[1:42:04] the people
[1:42:05] took counsel against jesus to put him to
[1:42:08] death
[1:42:09] and when they bet had bound him they led
[1:42:12] him away
[1:42:13] and delivered him to pontus pilate the
[1:42:16] governor
[1:42:20] and we know what happened from there
[1:42:22] they crucified him
[1:42:26] this is the final condition
[1:42:29] this is the scribes
[1:42:32] i'm sorry this is the chief priest the
[1:42:35] religious
[1:42:36] leaders of the day i cannot stress
[1:42:39] enough i am not talking about
[1:42:41] denominations
[1:42:42] as we know denominations it's definitely
[1:42:44] denominational spirit
[1:42:46] but i'm not talking about the common
[1:42:48] titles that we're associated with
[1:42:50] we are talking about the denominational
[1:42:53] religious
[1:42:54] spirit remember that was a natural
[1:42:58] occurrence we're in a spiritual
[1:43:00] occurrence
[1:43:00] that will bleed over into a physical
[1:43:04] occurrence
[1:43:05] but this is currently going on now we've
[1:43:07] seen it all over
[1:43:08] the spiritual condition is but now this
[1:43:12] is the change
[1:43:14] when all the chief priests and the
[1:43:17] elders of the people
[1:43:21] why do they need the people they're the
[1:43:24] chief priests
[1:43:27] why do they need the people took counsel
[1:43:30] against jesus to put him together
[1:43:32] and when they had bound him they led him
[1:43:35] away
[1:43:36] and delivered him to pontus pilate the
[1:43:39] governor
[1:43:40] there's your three classes of people
[1:43:43] that we have yet to face
[1:43:46] the religious leaders
[1:43:50] the people the government
[1:43:55] all three have to be unified
[1:43:59] against that bride and brother branham
[1:44:02] says when they
[1:44:04] are about to accomplish their cowardly
[1:44:06] plot
[1:44:08] he snatches her away
[1:44:10] [Music]
[1:44:11] you can't get to the snatching away
[1:44:14] without going through they're about to
[1:44:16] accomplish their cowardly plot
[1:44:20] don't try to change his words
[1:44:24] let it be the way he said it's going to
[1:44:27] be
[1:44:27] don't operate out of fear and
[1:44:31] a misunderstanding operate out of
[1:44:35] proper understanding and
[1:44:38] faith divine love
[1:44:41] [Music]
[1:44:42] these three must be joined together
[1:44:47] must be and no doubt but at an
[1:44:50] underlying level that we haven't been
[1:44:52] privy to yet
[1:44:53] they are joining together brother
[1:44:55] branham said when he was on the scene
[1:44:56] that that council was already set up
[1:45:00] but you remember the pattern we showed
[1:45:05] see if you were paying attention the
[1:45:08] council
[1:45:09] could do nothing
[1:45:12] until what
[1:45:16] they have to have the multitude and they
[1:45:19] have to have to have to have a
[1:45:22] judas
[1:45:27] judas wasn't here and when the prophet
[1:45:29] was here
[1:45:30] in the form that he needed to be in
[1:45:33] there wasn't even enough people that
[1:45:35] understood what was going on to resist
[1:45:37] what was going on
[1:45:38] and i don't say that disrespectfully i'm
[1:45:40] just saying that's the reality of it
[1:45:42] brother braden said they're preaching
[1:45:43] the seals as we've heard it he says you
[1:45:44] all aren't getting this
[1:45:46] you're not supposed to get it i mean how
[1:45:48] deflated spiritually
[1:45:50] but we would rather be honest than you
[1:45:52] know try to be like oh yeah i got it
[1:45:54] no he didn't
[1:45:58] i'd rather just somebody be honest
[1:46:00] you're not getting this you're just not
[1:46:02] getting it
[1:46:04] we'll get into that a little later on
[1:46:07] but we
[1:46:10] we had as brother bryan says i've got to
[1:46:12] pull back now and he says nothing
[1:46:14] sinfully no no nothing like that he says
[1:46:16] but i've just got to wait for these
[1:46:17] things to catch up
[1:46:19] what was he waiting to catch up
[1:46:22] what was he waiting to catch up
[1:46:28] the religious world would have crucified
[1:46:32] him then
[1:46:34] they wanted to then you'd think for a
[1:46:36] second they didn't want this man off the
[1:46:38] scene
[1:46:38] there were people prophesying of him
[1:46:40] going off the scene
[1:46:43] they missed how it was to happen but i
[1:46:44] mean they're prophesying he's going this
[1:46:46] way and he's going this way and then
[1:46:47] there were a lot of prophecies after
[1:46:49] that he got
[1:46:50] called off the scene in a car crash oh
[1:46:51] yeah the lord showed me he was going
[1:46:53] because he was
[1:46:54] you know he was abusing the word and he
[1:46:56] had got off i mean there was a lot of
[1:46:58] things
[1:46:58] after that he was taken off the scene
[1:47:00] that the lord had told people
[1:47:02] but you think for a second if they would
[1:47:05] have been able to snatch him off the
[1:47:07] scene
[1:47:08] and that ministry that they wouldn't
[1:47:09] have he was putting them all to shame
[1:47:12] because they couldn't combat that they
[1:47:15] could not combat that character in that
[1:47:17] living word that was in him
[1:47:19] to the point he would stand there in
[1:47:21] front of that ministerial association
[1:47:22] and say whoever it is
[1:47:24] whatever you've got just come and stand
[1:47:25] here with your bible and disprove me
[1:47:28] you think for a second that spirit's
[1:47:30] still not angry
[1:47:35] you think that spirits don't die saints
[1:47:39] the men passed away the spirit don't die
[1:47:42] you think for a second that spirit is
[1:47:45] not within the rank and file of the
[1:47:46] bride
[1:47:48] around her rank and file of the message
[1:47:50] church around the bride i would say
[1:47:53] and you think it's not roth steel
[1:47:58] you think it's not just absolutely
[1:48:03] just enraged
[1:48:08] from that proclamation i could be wrong
[1:48:11] just get your bible come here and stand
[1:48:13] disprove me anybody
[1:48:14] actually he didn't say he was wrong but
[1:48:16] that was just me saying that he knew
[1:48:18] where he stood
[1:48:19] he said i've preached this it's right if
[1:48:21] anybody can disprove me just bring your
[1:48:22] bible come here and stand
[1:48:25] you think for a second
[1:48:28] they're still not upset about that they
[1:48:30] would have
[1:48:31] crucified them that's why brother
[1:48:33] branham said so many times
[1:48:35] that i'll be shocked for this
[1:48:39] he was anticipating being shocked
[1:48:43] for preaching the gospel you'll notice
[1:48:46] he didn't quit preaching the gospel
[1:48:49] it didn't change one element of the way
[1:48:50] he was operating he didn't go buy a
[1:48:52] bulletproof vest
[1:48:54] he didn't go get you know body armor he
[1:48:57] didn't have bodyguards
[1:49:00] it did not it did not put him
[1:49:03] to operating in a level of fear or
[1:49:06] misunderstanding of where he was at what
[1:49:08] he was doing
[1:49:10] if i'm shocked for this i'm shocked for
[1:49:12] that the lamb
[1:49:14] approved it or it's not going to happen
[1:49:19] i was talking with some brothers there
[1:49:22] the other day
[1:49:24] and we'll get to this quote here in a
[1:49:25] second but you realize brother brown
[1:49:26] says
[1:49:27] it will come to the point in time that
[1:49:30] if you offer
[1:49:30] prayer for a man you'll be shot on the
[1:49:32] spot and i kind of
[1:49:35] got meditated on that i was like how how
[1:49:36] comical that actually is
[1:49:38] because you realize the person with the
[1:49:41] gun
[1:49:42] no matter what happens he leaves
[1:49:44] confused
[1:49:47] so option number one god instructs you
[1:49:51] to go pray for an individual
[1:49:52] you go there there's a man with a gun
[1:49:54] says you're not going to offer prayer
[1:49:56] for that individual or we're going to
[1:49:57] shoot you you pray for him anyhow
[1:50:00] he pulls out his gun he points his at
[1:50:02] you and it doesn't go off
[1:50:05] he's extremely confused
[1:50:08] option number two
[1:50:12] it does go off and nothing hits you
[1:50:18] maybe even more confused option number
[1:50:22] three maybe what we would term as worst
[1:50:23] case scenario
[1:50:25] but it does go off and it does kill you
[1:50:28] he still leaves confused
[1:50:31] of why any man
[1:50:34] would have a character and a love about
[1:50:36] him that knowing
[1:50:38] i'm going to shoot and kill him he still
[1:50:41] prays for his brother
[1:50:44] either way he leaves confused
[1:50:48] the devil does not know how to handle
[1:50:50] this power he does not know how to
[1:50:52] handle this character
[1:50:53] he does not have an understanding of how
[1:50:55] it works
[1:50:58] so if it does come to that point in time
[1:51:01] and worst case scenario
[1:51:02] happens just have the assurance and the
[1:51:05] joy
[1:51:06] that that guy's confused and you're in
[1:51:09] the sixth dimension so you'll
[1:51:11] you'll be okay that's maybe a little
[1:51:14] cardinal but seriously think about that
[1:51:16] they don't win saints they do not win
[1:51:19] no way at all no way at all
[1:51:22] so chapter 27 is the cornerstone of
[1:51:26] where all of this changes
[1:51:28] this is the climax this is the
[1:51:30] culmination
[1:51:31] of the going and this is a politically
[1:51:34] backed persecution brought on by the
[1:51:37] religious powers
[1:51:38] and the multitude of people who got the
[1:51:41] politics involved
[1:51:44] because the chief priests and the people
[1:51:46] cannot do anything until the
[1:51:48] politics tell them they can there's laws
[1:51:50] on the books that says you can't kill
[1:51:52] people for their religious beliefs
[1:51:53] in this country still that's why
[1:51:56] revelation 13 comes out of this country
[1:51:59] because it's out of this country the
[1:52:01] image not the beast
[1:52:03] the image to the beast comes out
[1:52:07] and then it gives power to the beast the
[1:52:10] image to the beast and the beast are two
[1:52:11] totally different things
[1:52:12] we have to recognize that and the image
[1:52:15] to the beast comes out of this nation
[1:52:18] by a politically a politically
[1:52:21] backed lawful persecution
[1:52:24] of the true bride of jesus christ
[1:52:27] that's why i can sit here and preach to
[1:52:29] you your atoms are not going to change
[1:52:31] tomorrow because that has not happened
[1:52:33] yet saints
[1:52:36] it has not happened and we are not going
[1:52:38] to get a free e-z pass
[1:52:43] we cannot get to the snatching away
[1:52:47] unless we first go through the attempted
[1:52:50] cowardly plot
[1:52:54] and i feel that i can say that and i
[1:52:56] feel there's a people here that believe
[1:52:57] that
[1:52:59] and like i said i'll always put that
[1:53:00] disclaimer out there that that can
[1:53:02] happen
[1:53:02] very quickly these look how quickly
[1:53:05] these things happen in jesus ministry
[1:53:09] but until they happen i'm not going to
[1:53:12] get ahead of god
[1:53:14] and i'm going to preach where we're at
[1:53:16] brother branham says the evidence of the
[1:53:18] holy ghost is to recognize your day and
[1:53:20] its message
[1:53:22] the evidence of the holy ghost is not to
[1:53:25] recognize
[1:53:26] a future day and its message
[1:53:30] the evidence of the holy ghost is to
[1:53:32] recognize your day
[1:53:34] and its message and as the
[1:53:37] revelation and the holy spirit is
[1:53:40] released in its fullness
[1:53:42] that clarity is going to get greater and
[1:53:45] greater
[1:53:45] and greater to the point it would tell a
[1:53:48] prophet
[1:53:48] that a prophet would say it didn't say
[1:53:51] you couldn't know the year the month or
[1:53:52] the week
[1:53:56] and none of that changes how we operate
[1:54:00] to
[1:54:00] our towards our god because we will be
[1:54:03] operating out of preeminence and divine
[1:54:05] love
[1:54:06] not looking for a way out
[1:54:12] that's the climax of the going now we
[1:54:15] know this pattern that was
[1:54:16] that laid here for us does not end in a
[1:54:19] crucifixion
[1:54:20] it ends in the in our atoms changing so
[1:54:23] that's where we can all rejoice
[1:54:25] scream glory hallelujah go back and read
[1:54:27] the scriptures that we started out with
[1:54:29] and have a good time that's the ending
[1:54:31] that's the sweet in the mouth
[1:54:33] but there's a lot of bitter in the belly
[1:54:35] in between there
[1:54:37] so we hopefully now have a proper
[1:54:40] timeline of where we're at
[1:54:41] and where we're operating at and the
[1:54:43] purpose of me ministering this is not to
[1:54:45] tell you something you don't know
[1:54:46] not to tell you you know something new
[1:54:49] but it's to refresh this
[1:54:50] because saints these this we say it's
[1:54:53] coming
[1:54:55] i'm going to say it's brother and says
[1:54:57] we're standing on the
[1:54:59] threshold of the millennium
[1:55:02] the threshold
[1:55:06] that's how close we are and when these
[1:55:08] things
[1:55:09] transpire you may not have we
[1:55:12] may not have the opportunity for
[1:55:14] somebody to go back and rehash all this
[1:55:16] to us so that we can get comfortable and
[1:55:18] remember where we're at and what's going
[1:55:19] on what's coming no
[1:55:20] these things are going to transpire just
[1:55:22] the way it transpired with jesus
[1:55:24] extremely quickly and it's going to be
[1:55:27] an
[1:55:28] individual walk at that time
[1:55:31] so i'll just say like peter said though
[1:55:33] you be taught correctly
[1:55:35] though you're pure in heart and though
[1:55:36] you're holy i just bring these things to
[1:55:38] your remembrance
[1:55:40] don't get out of the timeline of god and
[1:55:43] don't be scared of the timeline of god
[1:55:46] the story has a happy ending
[1:55:50] but don't try to skip chapters in it
[1:55:53] let him reveal to us where we're at okay
[1:55:57] so i'm going to go back to matthew 26
[1:56:01] verse 69 and i'm going to show you the
[1:56:04] bride's position in all of this
[1:56:06] somebody please make that clock stop
[1:56:10] mercy goodness
[1:56:15] this is us this is the appropriate
[1:56:19] bride response to the very
[1:56:22] final seconds and climax
[1:56:26] of our going matthew 26
[1:56:29] 69 now peter set without
[1:56:34] in the palace and the damsel came to him
[1:56:36] saying thou was with jesus of galilee
[1:56:38] but he denied before all of them saying
[1:56:40] i know not what thou sayest and when he
[1:56:42] was going out into the porch another
[1:56:43] maid saw him and said unto him that
[1:56:45] we're with
[1:56:46] that were there this fellow was also
[1:56:48] with jesus of nazareth
[1:56:49] and again he denied with an oath i do
[1:56:51] not know the man
[1:56:52] and then after a while came unto him
[1:56:54] they that stood by and said to peter
[1:56:56] surely thou art also one of them for thy
[1:56:59] speech betrayeth thee
[1:57:00] then he began to curse and to swear
[1:57:02] saying i know not the man
[1:57:04] and immediately the crew that
[1:57:07] portion is obviously not the portion i
[1:57:09] was referring to
[1:57:11] this is the bride's portion and peter
[1:57:13] remembered
[1:57:14] the word of the lord which said unto him
[1:57:19] before the crow thou shalt deny me
[1:57:22] thrice
[1:57:23] and he went out and wept
[1:57:26] bitterly he went out
[1:57:30] and he repented
[1:57:35] peter went out and repented
[1:57:40] that's the bride's position
[1:57:44] peter recognized he'd got ahead of god
[1:57:46] he got out of the will of the lord
[1:57:48] he had been fighting against god he
[1:57:50] realized that what
[1:57:52] god told him was going to happen just
[1:57:53] happened
[1:57:56] i just did what he told me i was going
[1:57:58] to do
[1:58:00] i told him i'd die before i did it my
[1:58:03] motives were pure my objectives were
[1:58:05] pure but you know what he told me what
[1:58:07] was going to happen
[1:58:09] and it just happened now peter repented
[1:58:13] for his own ways
[1:58:17] he repented for getting out of the
[1:58:19] timeline of god
[1:58:21] he repented for trying to fight a
[1:58:23] spiritual warfare carnally
[1:58:25] he repented for being offended by a true
[1:58:28] ministry
[1:58:31] this is the bride's position this
[1:58:35] is the climax of the bride's ministry
[1:58:38] if you'll turn to revelation 13 i'm
[1:58:40] sorry revelation 3.
[1:58:49] so there's the pattern and then
[1:58:53] at the end of jesus ministry
[1:58:56] to the church natural in his day when he
[1:58:58] was physically in a corporal body on
[1:59:00] this earth
[1:59:04] this is the culmination of jesus
[1:59:06] ministry
[1:59:08] in and through his bride
[1:59:11] and unto the angel of the church of the
[1:59:12] laodiceans write
[1:59:14] verse 14. these things saith the amen
[1:59:17] the faithful and true witness the
[1:59:18] beginning of the creation of god
[1:59:20] i know thy works that thou art neither
[1:59:22] cold nor hot i would thou work cold or
[1:59:24] hot
[1:59:25] sow them because they are lukewarm and
[1:59:26] neither cold nor hot i will spew thee
[1:59:28] out of my mouth
[1:59:30] because thou saith i am rich and
[1:59:31] increased with goods and have need of
[1:59:32] nothing and know us not that thou art
[1:59:34] wretched and miserable and poor and
[1:59:35] blind and naked
[1:59:36] i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[1:59:39] in the fire that thou mayest be rich in
[1:59:41] white raiment that thou mayest be
[1:59:42] clothed
[1:59:43] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[1:59:45] appear and anoint thine eyes without
[1:59:47] scythe that they might see
[1:59:49] as many as i love i rebuke and chasten
[1:59:51] be
[1:59:52] zealous therefore and
[1:59:55] repent you'll notice
[1:59:58] this condition was not met in the church
[2:00:00] ages
[2:00:02] this condition was not met in the
[2:00:03] multitude this condition
[2:00:06] was met in the individual
[2:00:10] this was out of the church ages this was
[2:00:13] out of the laodicean spirit
[2:00:15] this was a condition of the individual
[2:00:21] repentance
[2:00:25] repentance
[2:00:29] recognizing what what he was trying to
[2:00:33] say is he's
[2:00:34] brother reynolds says that this this
[2:00:36] portion of scripture was to the church
[2:00:37] age
[2:00:39] but the repentance wasn't you understand
[2:00:42] what i'm saying if you'll go back
[2:00:43] brother brainer says
[2:00:44] that this portion of scripture to verse
[2:00:46] 18 was to the church age
[2:00:49] he says a lot of ministers try to take
[2:00:50] this and use it to an individual like
[2:00:52] making an altar call he says that's
[2:00:54] he says this was a condition of the
[2:00:56] church age so i'm agreeing with what
[2:00:58] he's saying there what i'm saying
[2:00:59] is the church age didn't have this
[2:01:01] characteristic in it
[2:01:03] to repent you understand what i'm saying
[2:01:06] so
[2:01:06] now in order to display this
[2:01:08] characteristic of
[2:01:09] repentance it shows what what age you're
[2:01:12] in
[2:01:13] and it shows you're not in a layout can
[2:01:15] later
[2:01:16] see an age and condition this is the
[2:01:19] same condition that
[2:01:20] peter got into repentance
[2:01:23] for thinking his own ways pure motives
[2:01:26] pure objectives repentance for getting
[2:01:30] out of the word of god fighting against
[2:01:33] the word of god
[2:01:33] fighting a spiritual warfare carnally
[2:01:36] and this is the same condition
[2:01:39] this is just prior to the going of the
[2:01:41] bride
[2:01:42] this is just prior to the going of the
[2:01:45] bride in revelation
[2:01:47] and this same condition comes up be
[2:01:50] zealous therefore
[2:01:51] and repent the pattern's
[2:01:54] not going to change so guess what we
[2:01:57] need to do
[2:01:59] we need to be in prayer and we need to
[2:02:02] repent for our own ways
[2:02:04] i assure you if you do those two things
[2:02:08] you're going to be just fine you've got
[2:02:11] nothing to worry about
[2:02:12] if you deal with those two things pray
[2:02:15] when he tells you to pray
[2:02:18] repent when he tells you to repent be
[2:02:21] willing to do both in spite of all odds
[2:02:25] that's the condition we have to make
[2:02:29] continuing verse 20 behold i stand at
[2:02:32] the door and knock
[2:02:33] if any man hear my voice and open the
[2:02:35] door i will come into him
[2:02:37] and will sup with him and he with me
[2:02:42] i want you to go back to where we very
[2:02:45] first begin
[2:02:47] and remember what started all of this
[2:02:52] was one little lady who made a decision
[2:02:57] in that little room of her prayer closet
[2:03:00] i'm going to give all that i have
[2:03:04] until that's done none of this can come
[2:03:08] none of this can culminate but the
[2:03:11] reason
[2:03:13] that we've seen these things maybe not
[2:03:16] in their fullness yet
[2:03:17] and definitely not the politically
[2:03:19] backed persecution in this nation i'm
[2:03:21] not saying that's not going on in other
[2:03:22] portions of the nation
[2:03:23] but understand revelation 13 is a
[2:03:25] specific scripture
[2:03:27] of this nation that's what i'm speaking
[2:03:30] of and that has not been fulfilled yet
[2:03:32] in a physical way no doubt on a
[2:03:34] spiritual level and like i said
[2:03:35] no doubt they're having meetings about
[2:03:37] it right now i'm saying about a
[2:03:39] physical persecution towards the bride
[2:03:42] though that has happened
[2:03:43] and that specifically has to come out of
[2:03:45] this nation
[2:03:46] i mean yeah you go to iraq and say
[2:03:48] you're a christian they cut your head
[2:03:49] off
[2:03:50] i get that that's happening but that's
[2:03:52] not the fulfillment of revelation 13.
[2:03:55] revelation 13 has to come out of the
[2:03:57] united states
[2:03:58] it's very specific all of that
[2:04:04] has is hinging on me and you giving our
[2:04:08] all
[2:04:10] me and you giving preeminence if we
[2:04:13] want our atoms to change which i'm sure
[2:04:15] we all do
[2:04:17] more so as the days go by if we want to
[2:04:20] get to the climax and the culmination we
[2:04:24] have to
[2:04:24] follow the pattern and the condition and
[2:04:27] re
[2:04:28] respond appropriately to those things
[2:04:30] and that hinges
[2:04:32] on me and you giving preeminence
[2:04:35] amen i'm just going to read you a couple
[2:04:37] quotes to back this up
[2:04:38] and then we're going to bring this to a
[2:04:40] close 1954 acts of the holy spirit
[2:04:43] brother branham says
[2:04:44] i believe one of these glorious days
[2:04:47] when this united confederation of church
[2:04:49] goes together and the new pope is
[2:04:52] brought out of the united states and put
[2:04:54] over there according to prophecy
[2:04:56] then they'll form an image like unto the
[2:04:59] beast
[2:05:00] and i tell you the true church of god
[2:05:03] will be drove together
[2:05:04] the real true believers out of methodist
[2:05:06] and baptist and presbyterian pentecostal
[2:05:09] nazarene pilgrim holiness wherever
[2:05:11] whatever they'll be
[2:05:12] will go together and be cemented by the
[2:05:15] love of god
[2:05:16] that'll make the body of the lord jesus
[2:05:22] christ all believers
[2:05:25] and agnostics and shallow minded will be
[2:05:28] cast to one side
[2:05:29] they'll go right on into the
[2:05:31] confederation of churches
[2:05:33] there is so much there to preach i'm not
[2:05:35] even going to try but i just want to
[2:05:36] highlight a couple things
[2:05:37] brother branham gives us a specific
[2:05:39] point on the timeline here
[2:05:41] and he says and then i tell you the true
[2:05:43] church of god will be drove together
[2:05:45] what does that mean that means when the
[2:05:48] persecution comes the true church of god
[2:05:50] is still going to be here
[2:05:53] you can't be drove together if you're
[2:05:55] not here
[2:05:57] simple i know but i just want to
[2:06:01] make sure that we're catching that it
[2:06:03] doesn't say that they're going to be
[2:06:04] going sitting on a cloud somewhere
[2:06:06] he says when this persecution comes the
[2:06:09] true church is going to be drove
[2:06:14] together cemented
[2:06:17] by what not doctrine
[2:06:21] not because they all understand
[2:06:23] everything together
[2:06:25] cemented by love
[2:06:30] agnostics and shallow-minded will be
[2:06:32] cast to one side
[2:06:34] they'll go right on in the confederation
[2:06:38] 1963 what shall i do with jesus called
[2:06:40] christ and now the dynamics of this
[2:06:42] great
[2:06:43] regime that they've got built this big
[2:06:45] machine will work someday in the united
[2:06:47] council of the world council of churches
[2:06:49] which will make a forcing too you say
[2:06:52] when that happens
[2:06:54] he's saying basically as an individual
[2:06:56] they're going to say well when that
[2:06:57] happens
[2:06:58] i'll get right i believe that's what he
[2:07:00] was getting ready to say he cuts himself
[2:07:02] off
[2:07:02] he says you say when that happens
[2:07:07] it's going to be too late for you then
[2:07:10] you're already in it
[2:07:14] whether you want to listen to the saints
[2:07:17] whether you want to be or not you're
[2:07:20] already there see notice you've already
[2:07:24] got that spirit on you
[2:07:28] see what's controlling that you should
[2:07:32] be
[2:07:32] thankful if you can sit here and just in
[2:07:34] your carnal mind make the decision
[2:07:36] i would never join that counsel and i
[2:07:39] would never do that
[2:07:42] there will come a time though saints
[2:07:44] remember
[2:07:45] your mind is your spirit and if you have
[2:07:48] an anointing on that spirit it will
[2:07:50] change your mind
[2:07:52] and you will think you're doing right
[2:07:54] brother brandon says they will do this
[2:07:56] thinking they're doing right
[2:07:59] understand it is a spiritual driven that
[2:08:02] then physically manifests when it
[2:08:05] physically manifests that means they've
[2:08:08] already accepted the spirit
[2:08:11] brother random says when it comes to
[2:08:13] this point in time when we see these
[2:08:14] things happening then you'll say
[2:08:18] he says it will be too late for you then
[2:08:20] because you've
[2:08:22] already taken the spirit and when you
[2:08:25] take the spirit of something
[2:08:27] you're going to you're going to flesh
[2:08:29] that out it's going to happen
[2:08:31] your brain will align with that
[2:08:33] anointing and you will do things
[2:08:35] the same way the holy spirit works on us
[2:08:37] how many has had the holy spirit make
[2:08:39] you do something that you would not do
[2:08:41] normally why did you do it
[2:08:46] and what could you have done to stop it
[2:08:50] not a thing the same way that
[2:08:53] you take christ's spirit and it has
[2:08:56] preeminence on you
[2:08:57] and you do things you normally wouldn't
[2:08:59] do it's the exact same
[2:09:02] exact same for the false church
[2:09:05] they take that false spirit
[2:09:08] it gets preeminence and then they then
[2:09:12] they do things they normally would not
[2:09:15] have done
[2:09:17] that's why i say it's going to be close
[2:09:20] and it's going to be closer than you
[2:09:21] think and it's going to be the person
[2:09:23] that you would have never imagined
[2:09:27] because normally we'd say there's no way
[2:09:29] that brother or that sister would ever
[2:09:30] do anything like that
[2:09:33] but it's a spirit it's a
[2:09:37] spiritual condition that's why the
[2:09:39] ministry blasts against entertainment
[2:09:41] and worldly living so much
[2:09:44] it's not that if you line up to that
[2:09:46] that you're going to be fine
[2:09:48] if we don't want you operating under
[2:09:50] that spirit
[2:09:52] whether it's sinful or not
[2:09:56] if you're operating under that worldly
[2:09:59] spirit
[2:10:00] you're going to have something get on
[2:10:02] you that you don't recognize
[2:10:04] and you're going to be then operating
[2:10:06] and fleshing that out
[2:10:08] without even knowing it and then you'll
[2:10:10] get mad at the person that reveals it to
[2:10:12] you
[2:10:12] because they're not operating in that
[2:10:14] spirit
[2:10:16] and then that person will get mad at you
[2:10:18] because you see something they don't see
[2:10:20] and you tell them about it that's a
[2:10:23] whole nother topic for another day
[2:10:25] that's the way it's going to work those
[2:10:27] saints so let's get rid of our pride
[2:10:30] let's get rid of our pride and let's
[2:10:33] allow god
[2:10:34] to use the form that god has chosen to
[2:10:37] use
[2:10:38] to bring correction to us our brothers
[2:10:40] and our sisters
[2:10:42] the scripture says iron sharper than
[2:10:44] iron
[2:10:46] that's not an enjoyable process but that
[2:10:48] is
[2:10:49] god's way and will be
[2:10:52] more so i assure you it will be
[2:10:56] more so as time continues you are going
[2:10:59] to watch the
[2:11:00] ministry of jesus christ leave the
[2:11:03] pulpit
[2:11:04] and go into the people the pulpit will
[2:11:07] always be there to confirm it
[2:11:09] but that is not god's way and that's not
[2:11:12] his purpose and that's not his will
[2:11:14] brother brandon would say things like
[2:11:16] you know
[2:11:17] it's you older women's and
[2:11:19] responsibility in the church to deal
[2:11:20] with them young women
[2:11:21] dressing inappropriately
[2:11:25] brother branham should have never even
[2:11:26] had to preach on that he said it in the
[2:11:28] church who should deal with those things
[2:11:30] that's just one example you understand
[2:11:32] what i'm saying brother branham
[2:11:34] would have been happy the day he was out
[2:11:35] of a job that is the
[2:11:38] that is the five-fold ministries not the
[2:11:40] laity's ministry but that is the
[2:11:42] five-fold ministry's job
[2:11:44] is to preach ourself out of a job i
[2:11:46] cannot wait for the day that i don't
[2:11:48] have to preach anymore
[2:11:50] i will always have a ministry as your
[2:11:52] brother
[2:11:53] but i don't need to be a preacher i
[2:11:55] don't need to be a five-fold ministry
[2:11:57] preacher
[2:11:58] because when i come to that day the
[2:12:00] scripture says we are in perfection
[2:12:03] that's what i want i don't want to keep
[2:12:05] my preaching career alive
[2:12:07] while you all are in me or in perfection
[2:12:10] my goal and any true minister's goal is
[2:12:13] to preach ourself
[2:12:14] out of a job and the quicker we can get
[2:12:17] the ministry out of the pulpit and into
[2:12:19] the people the quicker we're getting out
[2:12:20] of here
[2:12:22] that is the key
[2:12:25] if you see somebody that's held up on
[2:12:27] pride
[2:12:28] and they won't accept the correction not
[2:12:32] only from the pulpit
[2:12:33] but from a brother and a sister they are
[2:12:37] the same way brother branham preached
[2:12:38] indictment to that generation
[2:12:41] they are indicted right then because
[2:12:44] that is the
[2:12:45] form that god has chose to speak is your
[2:12:48] brother
[2:12:49] and your sister
[2:12:52] now there's a side note to that
[2:12:55] because you say that's a very powerful
[2:12:58] situation to be in
[2:12:59] and you're right it is so
[2:13:02] now what thought
[2:13:06] and what meditation and what
[2:13:09] consideration
[2:13:10] should we give
[2:13:13] to the words coming out of our mouth
[2:13:19] now we start to have a proper
[2:13:21] understanding where brother branham says
[2:13:22] you should be a
[2:13:23] frank stern
[2:13:26] sober people it's not that brother
[2:13:30] branham didn't like laughing
[2:13:32] it's brother branham knew the position
[2:13:34] that was coming on the people
[2:13:37] and now we literally hold the power of
[2:13:41] god of mercy or judgment in our mouth
[2:13:49] and we can speak something to a brother
[2:13:51] or a sister
[2:13:53] that will be mercy or
[2:13:56] judgment to them depending
[2:13:59] on how they receive it
[2:14:03] let's not confuse them
[2:14:06] by always been the guy that makes
[2:14:08] everybody laugh
[2:14:10] so maybe he wasn't being real serious
[2:14:11] when he said that to me
[2:14:16] let's not be the sister always cutting
[2:14:19] up and carrying on
[2:14:23] let's put let's not let's
[2:14:26] not confuse our brother and sister
[2:14:28] brother raynor says you can be so
[2:14:30] spiritually minded that you're no
[2:14:31] earthly good
[2:14:33] i believe that i'm a long ways from that
[2:14:37] but maybe we should be more that
[2:14:42] if we're leaving this earth why do we
[2:14:44] need to be earthly good
[2:14:46] let's focus on being spiritually minded
[2:14:50] let's focus on our purpose and our
[2:14:52] calling and our position
[2:14:54] let's not confuse our brother and sister
[2:14:58] that when we're fellowshipping with them
[2:15:00] we have two hours of nonsense
[2:15:03] and now the word the lord drops a word
[2:15:05] in my heart for you
[2:15:07] and i've got to convince you that it's
[2:15:08] from the lord when i just spent two
[2:15:10] hours of absolute nonsense
[2:15:12] lord have mercy i'm getting back to my
[2:15:13] notes
[2:15:21] what
[2:15:25] we should give and consideration we
[2:15:28] should give
[2:15:30] to the power that we hold in the very
[2:15:33] words we speak
[2:15:37] if we really believe we're the bride
[2:15:40] and we really believe we're the mercy
[2:15:43] seat
[2:15:44] and the dispensing of mercy and judgment
[2:15:48] what thought should we give
[2:15:52] to our actions and our communications
[2:15:59] let's not confuse our brother and sister
[2:16:04] let's encourage them by our words and
[2:16:07] our actions
[2:16:08] to make them be comfortable with the
[2:16:10] fact
[2:16:11] that we can dispense mercy or judgment
[2:16:15] let's make them comfortable with that
[2:16:18] let's not send out
[2:16:19] confusing signals and i
[2:16:23] i don't have to i can't preach that as a
[2:16:25] doctrine
[2:16:26] i can't stack up a bunch of quotes and
[2:16:28] nail it into you
[2:16:29] the holy spirit has to reveal that to
[2:16:31] each individual
[2:16:33] the way that you're made your
[2:16:35] temperament
[2:16:36] because the scripture says there is a
[2:16:38] time to laugh
[2:16:40] there's a time to cry there's a time to
[2:16:42] mourn there is a
[2:16:43] time and a place and an order to things
[2:16:46] and i'm going to get off of this subject
[2:16:48] by one last thing brother branham says
[2:16:50] the
[2:16:50] spirit of america is entertainment and
[2:16:53] frolic
[2:16:55] if he's revealed that to us how guarded
[2:16:58] should we be against that
[2:17:00] let's not confuse our brothers and
[2:17:02] sisters if i'm
[2:17:04] entertainment and frolic one second and
[2:17:06] i'm the mercy seat the next
[2:17:09] let's give thought and meditation to
[2:17:11] that
[2:17:13] 1963 just once more i promise you i'm
[2:17:15] coming to a close
[2:17:17] because all organizations that isn't
[2:17:19] into this council of churches i got the
[2:17:20] paper on it that if your church is not
[2:17:22] in this council of churches in time of
[2:17:24] trouble
[2:17:25] in time of trouble trouble can be a lot
[2:17:28] of things
[2:17:31] i was talking about this with a brother
[2:17:33] the other day trouble can be a lot of
[2:17:35] things
[2:17:36] it can be a worldwide disease it can be
[2:17:40] a famine it can be a lot of things but
[2:17:42] in time of trouble
[2:17:44] they can use your church to store
[2:17:46] ammunition or anything that they want to
[2:17:49] and if any man is caught having a prayer
[2:17:51] for anybody outside of an affiliation
[2:17:53] with this council of churches
[2:17:54] can be shot as a federal offense that's
[2:17:56] right i got the papers on it from
[2:17:58] washington
[2:17:59] you they're going to force you into it
[2:18:02] two things i just want to point out
[2:18:03] there real quickly they can use this
[2:18:05] building for whatever they need to
[2:18:06] whenever they need to
[2:18:09] and you can be shot if you don't like it
[2:18:13] 1963 looking away to jesus there is
[2:18:16] coming a time
[2:18:17] upon in this nation
[2:18:20] to where this nation is going to
[2:18:23] exercise all the power that the beast
[2:18:25] had before it which was pagan rome
[2:18:27] when it became papal rome see that this
[2:18:30] nation will do that
[2:18:31] revelation 13 plainly explains it and
[2:18:33] then after a while it received power and
[2:18:36] spoke like a dragon and exercised all
[2:18:38] the power the dragon had before him
[2:18:40] and the dragon is rome always so don't
[2:18:42] you see
[2:18:43] roman denomination a mark protestant
[2:18:45] denomination
[2:18:46] an image unto the beast making a power
[2:18:49] that will force
[2:18:50] all protestants like a union you'll have
[2:18:53] you'll have to be in this council of
[2:18:54] churches
[2:18:55] or you won't be able to have fellowship
[2:18:57] well it's practically that way now you
[2:18:59] can't go to a church and preach unless
[2:19:00] you have a fellowship card or some event
[2:19:02] identification and now on persons like
[2:19:05] ourselves
[2:19:07] we're going to be cut out of all that
[2:19:10] altogether that's exactly
[2:19:12] because they won't be able to do it it's
[2:19:14] tightening
[2:19:15] and then when that time comes
[2:19:18] and the press comes to a place where
[2:19:20] you're pressed out
[2:19:22] then watch what i'm fixing to tell you
[2:19:25] watch the third pull then see
[2:19:28] and it'll be absolutely to the total
[2:19:31] lost
[2:19:32] but for the bride and the church
[2:19:37] i want to emphasize one thing here we
[2:19:40] can all rejoice when he says and then
[2:19:42] when that time comes and the press comes
[2:19:44] to a place where you're pressed out
[2:19:45] then watch what i'm fixing to tell you
[2:19:47] in a few minutes
[2:19:48] watch the third pull then
[2:19:51] glory hallelujah wonderful experience
[2:19:57] look at what's right before
[2:20:02] it tells you the true church and the
[2:20:04] fullness of the manifestation of the
[2:20:06] third pool
[2:20:07] will be here in the time of a
[2:20:08] politically backed persecution
[2:20:10] that originated from this nation
[2:20:14] 1964 his unfailing words of promise now
[2:20:16] that great gift
[2:20:18] others i've tried to explain and say how
[2:20:19] it was done this
[2:20:21] can't be explained just wait
[2:20:25] it will not be in operation so perfectly
[2:20:27] now
[2:20:28] wait till that council of churches
[2:20:30] brings on that persecution
[2:20:32] that's when it will happen
[2:20:36] ditto to what i just said about the
[2:20:37] other quote we will be here
[2:20:40] at that time it originates out of this
[2:20:42] nation
[2:20:44] don't be afraid of that the lamb
[2:20:47] is in control 1964 god's word calls for
[2:20:52] a total separation from unbelief
[2:20:53] but the last thing was to be a great
[2:20:55] thing would take place
[2:20:56] we've been watching for it all these
[2:20:58] years and we all know when it happened
[2:21:00] first when a creation come into
[2:21:02] existence the third time
[2:21:03] and then the fourth time last night i
[2:21:05] told you the fifth time speaking about
[2:21:06] the tumor and media
[2:21:08] and it's waiting for this count it's
[2:21:10] waiting
[2:21:12] it's waiting for this council of
[2:21:13] churches when it unites and the
[2:21:16] protestants
[2:21:17] if i speak saturday morning that's what
[2:21:19] i want to speak on and then when this
[2:21:21] gets together
[2:21:22] then the spirit of god always raises a
[2:21:25] standard against them
[2:21:27] so you tell me what's got to come first
[2:21:30] the fullness of the manifestation of the
[2:21:32] third pool or a politically backed
[2:21:33] persecution out of this nation
[2:21:36] do you believe that you're going to
[2:21:38] demonstrate the fullness of the
[2:21:39] manifestation
[2:21:40] of the third pole prior to your atoms
[2:21:41] changing yes you do
[2:21:43] that also means that prior to your atoms
[2:21:45] changing you're going to face a
[2:21:47] politically backed persecution out of
[2:21:48] this
[2:21:49] nation let the prophet preach the
[2:21:51] doctrine don't try to change it because
[2:21:53] you regret
[2:21:54] begrudging your extended stay quit
[2:21:57] trying to change the atoms of your body
[2:21:59] thinking that if you pray hard enough or
[2:22:01] if you fast long enough
[2:22:02] something will happen it's not going to
[2:22:04] happen until the word's been fulfilled
[2:22:07] get on board with the word and the word
[2:22:09] will lead you when to fast and when to
[2:22:11] pray and what to fast and what to pray
[2:22:12] for
[2:22:14] don't fight a spiritual war carnally
[2:22:17] 1964 shalom and we all know that's the
[2:22:20] identification
[2:22:21] we know what the third poll is we all
[2:22:24] understand that
[2:22:25] now you've got you'll have a tape see
[2:22:27] and i think it'll
[2:22:28] just lay dormant for a while
[2:22:32] until the great hour of persecution
[2:22:34] comes
[2:22:35] i feel that you're getting my drift so
[2:22:37] i'm going to move on that's when it'll
[2:22:39] speak it'll be manifested just like the
[2:22:41] five straight signs without failure
[2:22:43] perfectly and now i think just wait
[2:22:46] see to see what it done
[2:22:50] 1963 church order and remember god is
[2:22:53] looking to me to see that i stay in the
[2:22:55] word
[2:22:55] and i'm looking to you to see that you
[2:22:57] carry out the word see
[2:22:58] in this church and keep it spiritual for
[2:23:01] remember all the forces of darkness
[2:23:04] the kingdom the dark kingdom of satan
[2:23:07] will be turned against you
[2:23:08] as you begin to grow in the lord and you
[2:23:11] must be
[2:23:12] soldiers not just fresh recruits
[2:23:15] your aged soldiers now and been trained
[2:23:19] to fight
[2:23:20] and satan will come amongst you cause
[2:23:22] you to dispute with one another
[2:23:24] if he can i wonder why he'd want you to
[2:23:26] do that
[2:23:29] maybe satan knows where the mercy seat's
[2:23:30] at
[2:23:34] maybe he does i'm convinced he does why
[2:23:37] else would he want you to dispute with
[2:23:38] one another
[2:23:39] what's he care what you all do with one
[2:23:40] with another what what relevance does
[2:23:42] that make
[2:23:45] he knows where the scriptures
[2:23:48] are lined up at and he knows what's
[2:23:51] coming his way
[2:23:53] and he will do anything to sort that
[2:23:55] he's not concerned
[2:23:56] about the nail scarred corporal body of
[2:23:58] jesus christ right now
[2:24:01] what he's concerned about is mrs jesus
[2:24:05] christ and the form that god
[2:24:08] has chosen to come in that's why he
[2:24:12] wants to bring dispute to you and
[2:24:14] your brother and your sister because he
[2:24:16] know if he knows if he can drive a wedge
[2:24:18] in there
[2:24:19] we're separated from the mercy seat
[2:24:24] god how else is god going to bring
[2:24:25] correction saints
[2:24:28] he's got no mouth but your mouth no feet
[2:24:30] but my feet
[2:24:31] no hands but your hands it's the form
[2:24:34] that he's chosen to use
[2:24:36] he's got to stick with it he's
[2:24:40] not going to change the form just
[2:24:42] because we saw that brother make a
[2:24:44] mistake two weeks ago
[2:24:47] it's the form he's chosen to use get on
[2:24:51] board with it
[2:24:55] you have to be age soldiers not fresh
[2:24:58] recruits
[2:25:00] and we're here to hold a standard in
[2:25:02] this evening like time and when the
[2:25:03] world is darkened and the whole church
[2:25:05] kingdom is going into the council of
[2:25:06] churches and pretty soon they'll
[2:25:08] they'll try to attack a sign on this
[2:25:10] door here closed
[2:25:12] and then we're going to have to meet
[2:25:13] other places
[2:25:16] last time i checked we're still meeting
[2:25:18] at a church
[2:25:19] this has not been fulfilled yet don't
[2:25:22] ask for your atoms to change until it
[2:25:23] does
[2:25:25] be in line with the timeline
[2:25:28] be in line with the timeline
[2:25:32] because they'll certainly certainly
[2:25:36] close these churches one of these days
[2:25:42] if we don't take the mark of the beast
[2:25:46] so if we see a politically backed
[2:25:48] persecution that's not concerned about
[2:25:50] our church closing
[2:25:51] we got a big problem
[2:25:54] moving on 1963 there is a man here that
[2:25:57] can turn on the light
[2:26:00] when the persecution comes i wonder why
[2:26:02] he tell us about a persecution coming if
[2:26:04] we're not going to be here for it
[2:26:07] when the persecution comes
[2:26:10] this is so profound look i'm just going
[2:26:13] to read it
[2:26:14] when the persecution comes don't
[2:26:17] get scared
[2:26:20] now i really feel like preaching i'm
[2:26:22] gonna have to make y'all stand up and
[2:26:23] sit down a couple of times
[2:26:25] look what he does he ties this right
[2:26:28] directly back to matthew 26
[2:26:31] he knows where he's standing saints he's
[2:26:33] not just throwing these things out here
[2:26:35] he knows with this when this comes what
[2:26:38] conditions were here before
[2:26:40] so of all things that he could tell us
[2:26:43] of
[2:26:44] all things that he could tell us to do
[2:26:46] when this comes what does he tell us
[2:26:50] don't get scared
[2:26:54] it's perfectly in line with the
[2:26:55] scriptures and the only way
[2:26:58] that you're going to be able to do what
[2:27:00] your prophet has commanded you to do
[2:27:03] is if you are in dedicated prayer
[2:27:06] consecrated to god so that you have a
[2:27:09] proper understanding
[2:27:10] of what time you're in and the word for
[2:27:13] your hour
[2:27:14] and when you have those two things by
[2:27:17] default
[2:27:19] there will be no fear
[2:27:22] and again that doesn't mean that it's
[2:27:24] going to be a pleasant experience and
[2:27:25] that doesn't mean that your flesh is
[2:27:26] going to be comfortable
[2:27:28] you may be terrified in the flesh the
[2:27:30] flesh doesn't matter
[2:27:32] what matters is you have no fear
[2:27:35] in your soul you have no fear in your
[2:27:37] spirit
[2:27:38] you know where you're standing and as
[2:27:40] brother branham says i'm going to come
[2:27:42] to that day
[2:27:43] and i'm going to serve him with
[2:27:44] everything that i have and he looks at
[2:27:46] me
[2:27:47] and kicks me into hell i'm going to kiss
[2:27:49] his bottom of his boots when he's doing
[2:27:51] it
[2:27:52] that's the character word to live in
[2:27:57] when that persecution comes don't get
[2:28:00] scared there is a light
[2:28:03] he said he would catch his people away
[2:28:06] she'll not go through the tribulation
[2:28:09] she'll never do it
[2:28:11] he said she wouldn't she'll be caught
[2:28:14] away
[2:28:15] how they going to do it brother branham
[2:28:17] it looks awful dark
[2:28:20] no matter how dark it gets
[2:28:26] no matter how dark it gets why would he
[2:28:29] be emphasizing
[2:28:30] it's going to get dark if it's not going
[2:28:33] to get dark
[2:28:35] these aren't frivolous tape space
[2:28:38] using words no matter
[2:28:42] how dark it gets you can't see your hand
[2:28:45] before you
[2:28:47] that's pretty dark
[2:28:50] just remember there is a man here
[2:28:53] who can turn on the light he'll
[2:28:56] rapture the church that is the climax
[2:29:00] rapture that is the atom's changing
[2:29:02] rapture
[2:29:03] that is we are no longer in this
[2:29:05] dimension rapture
[2:29:07] but before that happens it's going to
[2:29:10] get
[2:29:11] dark to where you cannot see your hand
[2:29:14] before your face
[2:29:15] take the natural apply it to the
[2:29:16] spiritual it's
[2:29:18] going to be a physically
[2:29:22] physical persecution backed by
[2:29:25] a political religious force
[2:29:29] i'm going to have brother franco play
[2:29:30] this clip real quick as soon as i finish
[2:29:32] reading the end of it because i want you

[2:33:42] that is our position saints that is our
[2:33:45] calling
[2:33:47] we do not operate out of fear we know
[2:33:50] where we stand
[2:33:51] we know what's coming and we're going to
[2:33:54] conduct ourselves with
[2:33:55] joy amongst the trials that he sees fit
[2:33:59] to bring our way politically backed or
[2:34:02] not
[2:34:03] it will be will the church be closed it
[2:34:07] will be
[2:34:08] will we be an offense will the shepherd
[2:34:10] be smitten it will be will we be
[2:34:12] scattered we will be
[2:34:14] we're not going to change these patterns
[2:34:16] the only thing we can change is our
[2:34:18] response
[2:34:19] to the conditions
[2:34:22] and i want to leave you with what we
[2:34:23] started on remember all of that
[2:34:27] all of that i'm going to say this and
[2:34:29] this is going to sound harsh
[2:34:31] but i can't help but say it quit asking
[2:34:34] for your atoms to change if you're not
[2:34:36] willing to give all
[2:34:39] and that goes for me and you and anybody
[2:34:45] there's a lot of people wanted brother
[2:34:46] branham's ministry and the power that
[2:34:48] came with it
[2:34:49] how many of them were willing to do what
[2:34:50] he did
[2:34:53] quit asking for your atoms to change if
[2:34:55] you haven't given all
[2:34:57] when you give all and when i give all
[2:35:00] that goes for me i'm not i'm not pre i
[2:35:01] know i'm pointing at you but i'm
[2:35:03] i'm pointing to myself quit asking for
[2:35:07] something quit asking for a way out quit
[2:35:08] looking for a way out
[2:35:10] if you haven't done what the scriptures
[2:35:11] told us to do because when you do and
[2:35:14] when i do what he's told us to do
[2:35:16] that scriptural pattern will not change
[2:35:18] and look how quickly it processed
[2:35:22] from one thing giving all
[2:35:26] let's give all as we would bow our heads

[2:37:45] to bring the final blow to the final age
[2:37:50] to literally put death under our feet
[2:37:54] lord we we don't understand how that
[2:37:55] works but we are

[2:38:03] christians longed for in days prior
[2:38:07] we thank you for that no doubt it will
[2:38:09] be difficult lord

[2:39:10] that were read
[2:39:12] why is it that this is heavy
[2:39:16] this is a heavy this is a heavy service
[2:39:19] these are heavy things
[2:39:20] why is that there's a witness in your
[2:39:22] heart that says it's true
[2:39:25] and it's timely i mean most people would
[2:39:28] be afraid
[2:39:29] intimidated timid but although we
[2:39:32] there's some anxiety we don't know what
[2:39:34] will happen next we know what it will
[2:39:36] look like
[2:39:36] we don't know how much suffering there
[2:39:38] will be we don't know how much pressure
[2:39:39] will be
[2:39:40] but something inside says i was made for
[2:39:42] this hour
[2:39:44] you know why because before you come to
[2:39:46] earth in a state of
[2:39:48] spiritual amnesia you already knew this
[2:39:50] was what you were coming to
[2:39:54] you just come into spiritual amnesia and
[2:39:55] forgot but it's already played out in
[2:39:57] the mind of god and you were there
[2:39:59] amen and you already knew this would
[2:40:00] happen and now you're coming down here
[2:40:02] and the word is breaking away spiritual
[2:40:04] amnesia
[2:40:04] and there's something very familiar down
[2:40:07] deep inside of you that can relate to
[2:40:09] what's being preached
[2:40:11] there will be people god has ordained to
[2:40:15] be here his seed genes his
[2:40:17] people his attributes that will be here
[2:40:19] to overcome
[2:40:20] all of those things and if you're one of
[2:40:24] them you could count yourself one of the
[2:40:25] most privileged people that have ever
[2:40:27] walked the face of the earth
[2:40:29] because you've been ordained and you've
[2:40:30] been placed and you've been called
[2:40:32] to a glorious stand say god help me
[2:40:36] help me die to myself i love the woman
[2:40:39] with the alabaster box she gave up
[2:40:41] everything but there was a two other
[2:40:44] church members one time in the new
[2:40:45] testament church
[2:40:46] called ananias and sapphira they were in
[2:40:49] the church they were part of the church
[2:40:51] they probably were part of the
[2:40:52] fellowships they probably were invited
[2:40:54] over to people's homes they probably
[2:40:55] had part of the services
[2:40:59] but ananias and sapphira didn't give
[2:41:01] everything
[2:41:02] they held some back and they died
[2:41:09] this matters it matters that we give
[2:41:12] everything
[2:41:14] there's been too much ananias and
[2:41:15] sapphira i'll give my tithe amen and
[2:41:18] i'll go to sunday and wednesday but i'm
[2:41:19] not giving all
[2:41:21] i'm not giving up my favorite
[2:41:22] entertainment or my favorite program or
[2:41:24] my favorite vice or my favorite complex
[2:41:28] but that ananias fire died and the bride
[2:41:31] will die
[2:41:32] spiritually unless she's willing to give
[2:41:34] everything
[2:41:36] i want to be identified with the little
[2:41:38] woman of bad reputation
[2:41:41] bad reputation bad living bad everything
[2:41:45] but when it counted amen that seat on
[2:41:47] the inside
[2:41:48] came through with the right action in
[2:41:50] the right time and she was willing
[2:41:52] she had no reputation so she had nothing
[2:41:54] to lose
[2:41:56] oh praise god let us come to a place
[2:41:58] where we have no reputation
[2:42:00] so we have nothing to lose let's just
[2:42:02] die right now let's just choose humility
[2:42:05] let's just choose death let's just
[2:42:06] choose to say you know what
[2:42:08] i am nothing amen nothing about me is
[2:42:11] special
[2:42:11] amen the only thing that's special
[2:42:13] whatever part is him
[2:42:15] and i want to die to everything else
[2:42:17] praise be to god
[2:42:19] don't be afraid but you've seen
[2:42:22] temporarily
[2:42:24] you'll see manifest in the fullness of
[2:42:25] its power
[2:42:27] don't be afraid amen god bless you
[2:42:31] i was thinking i've been meditating on
[2:42:32] the thing where the the
[2:42:34] part of the sermon where brother branham
[2:42:36] was preaching that time and brother way
[2:42:38] fell over dead just been on my mind over
[2:42:41] the last few days
[2:42:43] brother way fell over dead and brother
[2:42:45] ben said the people got nervous
[2:42:47] and they started to scream and they
[2:42:49] started talking and brother ben says
[2:42:50] you've been taught better than that
[2:42:52] you're a better trained people than that
[2:42:55] i mean the man fell dead and you know
[2:42:58] us in our carnal mind we wouldn't fault
[2:43:00] anybody for squealing or saying oh
[2:43:03] our lord jesus help us amen but brother
[2:43:05] brennan was rebuking the whole
[2:43:07] congregation he said you should be more
[2:43:08] mature than that
[2:43:09] you've been taught better than that
[2:43:11] you've been better trained than that
[2:43:14] amen when some of these things begin to
[2:43:16] happen and brother brother so-and-so is
[2:43:18] taken away we can't find this one you've
[2:43:20] been better trained than that
[2:43:22] you know what's happening amen you know
[2:43:23] what's coming it is not time to be
[2:43:25] fearful it's not time to run around
[2:43:27] amen like a chicken with no head the
[2:43:29] head ship has come
[2:43:30] we're eagles not chickens under the
[2:43:32] headship of mama eagle
[2:43:33] there's no reason to be afraid or run
[2:43:35] around or let anxiety take us over
[2:43:38] amen we've got to resist those spirits
[2:43:41] we ought to be better trained people
[2:43:43] than that
[2:43:44] we got to have better training what has
[2:43:47] god been doing over the last 50 some
[2:43:48] years
[2:43:49] training his bride for that final stand
[2:43:53] and she's going to make it and i just
[2:43:56] want to be
[2:43:57] one of them god bless you
