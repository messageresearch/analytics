sun sunshine today he meant god is still on the throne everything is still in order amen it was beautiful out today and it was it was nice to see the sun shine amen praise god while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn to the gospel of john chapter 16. i want to uh remind everybody too that this sunday we'll be having our vote we have an annual vote every year one year for trustees one year for deakins a vote of conference a vote of confidence and a confirmation again uh so the trustees will be no change in the trustees and so they'll all be on the ballot for a vote of confidence and then we've got one additional deacon to present to the congregation brother jeriah wholesale so he'll also be on that ballot so we'll be doing that sunday at the beginning of service so don't want to forget that be praying about that and pray for god's leadership for the body in that i also want to say brother don and sister sally lightner will be moving this weekend so they've been here in lima area and visiting us quite often for a while but they'll be moving to pennsylvania to be close for closer to family so be praying for them pray for their move and keep them in your prayers as they make this transition right now so god bless you both amen let's go ahead and read our scripture john 16 and verse 13. how be it when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth for you shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall i speak and he shall show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i that he shall make take of mine and shall show it unto you i mean let's just pray for the lord's blessing dear heavenly father we thank you for the reading of the word and for the privilege to be here lord god it's not passing us by what a special privilege this is by your grace and your mercy god we just take it seriously now and we thank you that we can be here to worship your name that we can gather together to sing your praises lord we pray now god that you would come in the way that you've promised lord that you would break the bread of life to us through the preaching of the word that we me we might feed from your hand as your sheep this evening we give you preeminence lord and pray that you would take control in jesus name we pray amen you can have your seats i just want to talk about a couple things here before we move on we've had um because of the the crisis that's going on we've had a few of the brothers in the church uh lose some work and and we may have more we may have more needs but there's a deacon's fund so if you feel impressed at all to give at this time to the deacon's fund you can do that on the tithe envelope under special needs just right deacons or deacons fun and the deacons will take care of that but i also want to let everybody know that that's there because if if you know of somebody that has lost a job or lost work even temporarily and then just you know you might want to check on them or you want to might want to pass that off to one of the deacons so the deacons can check on them because they may miss some people they may not catch what's going on all over but let's take care of one another let's watch out for one another and let's band ourselves together and and you know this is a this is a good time for us to draw up closer amen and take care of one another we don't know what the economic impact will be completely or how far reaching the economic impact will be it may be that the economic complications are are worse or take longer to recover from even than the virus so we don't know what will happen in the future but i had a conversation with my family and told them that we we're going to be a little more conservative and we're going to cut out what we can cut out and try to have no waste so that we have a little extra money in our hands in case we have a brother or sister who needs it and so i think as a body that's a good idea now would be a good idea to tighten the belt a little bit and cut off any surplus it's not like we can go out to eat so that should be a little extra money amen it's not like we're traveling for vacation right now so it's a good time just to put aside anything we can for needs that our brothers and sisters might have i believe god will bless his bride in the midst of trouble amen it may be difficult it may not be easy but i probably i believe he'll bless his bride and where one lacks i believe he'll give somebody else a surplus and if we just watch one another we can take care of one another so we just pray for that also i just wanted to mention that we've got you know more people spending more time at home than before and this is a blessing this is a blessing because we live in a in a fast-paced society in a world that keeps moving and won't ever stop no matter how bad we want it to stop and god has created circumstances maybe not everybody's in that situation now but some some certainly are in the situation where life just paused in some ways can't do everything that we were doing before and can't run to all the places we were running before and and if god has given us more time let's not waste it and i'd like to say for the families this would be a good time to rebuild the family altar because we get so busy in this life sometimes that family altar gets a little bit neglected amen and maybe we get a little bit busy and we don't spend as much time gathering as a family for prayer and for devotions or to listen to a tape or to listen to a uh archived message like we used to but now would be a great time amen to put those stones back together and get that family altar spruced up and back into shape and spend some time together around the word of god and god has god has given his bride what she needs and if we have more time that means we need it let's not waste it let's use it in preparation for what comes next also i'd like to suggest uh this past november uh brother abraham myra was here and he preached two messages that i'd like to suggest if you're at home and looking for something to do you can go back and watch these two services but in those two services he preached uh some things that i think we're seeing transpire right now he talked about the the ship you know that paul the apostle was on when he was a prisoner and and now the angel of the lord came to the apostle paul and told him that you're going to lose all the merchandise and you're going to lose the ship but not one soul will be lost and everything's going to fall apart and at the end of the journey you'll be swimming alone an individual walk with god either clinging to a board or swimming to land and he preached two parts on that and i'd recommend going back and listening to it i think if you listen to it now it'll be like wow he preached this in november so that would be a good thing to listen to but but yeah don't gather around and pray gather around this is a great time to talk to your children things are changing things that i've never seen in my lifetime most of us have never seen in our lives times but it's a great time to to to talk to our children and share with them what we're seeing and and the effect that it's having and the change in the world because they're just young children living at a time that things are are changing rapidly and fast and and appears to be the wrap-up of all things and and let's take our time with our children and explain these things to them and talk to them and pray with them and that everybody's equipped amen everybody is in place for whatever comes next so let's not waste these times i just want to encourage you many of you are already doing that but i want to encourage you just to just to focus that time that we have and and not waste it not squander it away this is a special time this is a special time to be alive i would say it's a privileged time to be alive and it may be that in the flesh we have to get more uncomfortable than we are now it it very well may be in fact i wouldn't say very well it will be more uncomfortable as far as the flesh goes the flesh is going to get more uncomfortable things may get a little more scratchy along the way and the press will get a tighter and tighter and tighter but praise god it's a privilege to be alive it's a privilege to be in this day to see the things transpire that prophets have longed to see that that all the church ages have longed for and here we stand in the time where these things are unfolding rapidly and it's a privilege to be alive but i want to be alert and attentive in this hour and i want to be spiritually minded not carnally minded so i can catch what god's doing i want to be i want to be in tune i want to be in the rhythm of the symphony as we listen to the message shalom i want to hear the changing of the beat do you hear the changing of the bee it's not hard right now your co-worker at work can hear the changing of the beam but i don't just mean the carnal things i mean spiritually are we catching that that god is moving his symphony along and i want to move with him i want to make the junction i don't want to be delayed and have to catch up i want to be when he moves i want to move this is a good time amen to to be sensitive and to be careful prayed up and meant in tune with what god's doing i'd like for us to turn to the book of exodus chapter three and i just want to spend a little time this evening in the word talking about following the pillar of fire and all of these things everything we're going to talk about are very familiar to us nothing new and but but it's just so refreshing for me to look at these things and and and take them in the hour that we live in and the circumstances that we're in and just go back over these things again to put our feet on solid ground because we're standing on solid ground the world is shifting sands but we're standing on solid ground in exodus chapter 3 let's read from verse 1. now moses kept the flock of jethro his father-in-law the priest of midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to horeb and the angel the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the lord saw that he turned aside to sea god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place wherein thou stand this is holy ground moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hit his face for he was afraid to look upon god and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmaster for i know their sorrows so he starts off by getting moses attention in the pillar of fire and moses is going to receive some instructions in this contact his contact with the pillar of fire which we know is the angel of the lord which we know is god and when moses when god begins to speak to moses and he knows who it is is speaking he hid his face for he feared to look at god because when we come in contact with the pillar of fire it should bring us into humility it should humble us it should break us down and in the the right approach is through humility remember when when isaiah when he saw the cherubim and the seraphim and the temple in worship he saw with two wings they covered their face and two wings they covered their feet and with two they were flying he said they were they were they recovered their feet in humility amen they covered their face in reverence and with two wings they were in action and he said this is the way to serve god in reverence in humility and in action not just in an action but in reverence and humility and in action and god had made sure that moses was in the right place because moses wasn't reverent and humble to begin with because moses was raised up in egypt with the best training military training and education and the finest of everything and he had in himself the idea that he could be a deliverer he was told he was a deliverer and he was it was truth it was nothing but the truth he was called to be a deliverer he was born a proper child and then he was born under a sign born to be the deliverer but all his earthly training amen got him a false confidence and he went into action without the leadership of the pillar of fire it wasn't the leadership of god but it was by his own desire in his own mind to deliver his people and he failed and he ran afraid afraid for his life and he ran into the wilderness amen and he went from a military man he went from a prince in egypt and he became a man who kept the flock of jethro his father-in-law in the backside of the desert by himself with a little family out out away from the fineries of egypt and there for 40 years brother bam said god had to beat moses out of moses and get him to the place where god would call to him when he would come and he would declare who he is he would hide his face for he feared to look at god he had been humbled i say praise god help us lord to approach you humbly if you're going to do something mighty in our lives in this age and we believe this is the age for a mighty demonstration of power amen it must come through humble vessels who are reverent to god and reverent to his word so he must be reverent humble and in action so he got moses into this place and and then he says in verse 7 he said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmaster for i i know their sorrows god is declaring i know exactly what they're going through now you probably would have a hard time convincing those that were in egypt at the time this is being said when they were when they were under the task master when they were cruelly treated and they were in bondage amen they were probably having a hard time amen believing that god was looking on their sorrows and heard their cry but he declares to moses that he he says i have surely seen the affliction of my people who were they they were his people when were they ever not his people they were always his people they were his people because they were the children of abraham amen and he said i have seen my people i've seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and i have heard their cry by reason of their task masters so for all those years they wondered where god was god was watching and god was hearing and for seven church ages god has been watching and god has been hearing he hasn't missed the one remember the prayers of the saints amen have been saved up in vials to be poured out of the end time amen because there was a time for deliverance and there was a promise for deliverance and there was a way that deliverance was going to come amen and god was taking all of those prayers of the saints in the new testament and when you get to the book of revelation the poor the the prayers of the saints were poured out before god when the lamb took the book because now it's time for deliverance this is the way of deliverance and god didn't lose one of those prayers he heard them all he knew the affliction he knew what was happening in the bondage of catholicism amen god knows where we're at he knows all about it verse 8 and that i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians that i have come down personally i have come down to deliver them personally when god's going to bring a deliverance he's going to come down personally what do you think that cloud was that appeared in azera arizona in the skies amen in february 28th in 1963 that was him coming down personally they didn't see in this day of god coming down amen in his own human flesh amen he was coming down and working through moses the prophet but it was he himself that was coming down i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good land and a large into a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel has come unto me and i've also seen the oppression where with the egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt praise god god always comes in such a humble way that pharaoh didn't know it was god coming down to deliver him he saw an 80 year old man with a stick in his hand who wasn't even eloquent of speech by this point and he would have his i mean he would whisper to his brother then his brother would speak for him and he was saying let my people go as god has said let my people go and pharaoh saw these two old men because aaron was older than than moses and he saw these two old men and he saw the foolishness of this of this of this deliverance and he didn't know that it was god himself come down to deliver them all he saw was humble people all he saw was people who had been on the you know moses the backside endeavored in the desert and come into humility to the place where he wasn't even willing to speak for himself amen when he saw that brokenness and he saw that humbleness and then he saw the way pharaoh just laughed at him but he didn't know that it was god hiding behind this skin and that god was going to bring bring his people out by a mighty hand and god wanted to do it this way so that he could absolutely destroy the works of pharaoh [Music] praise god let's turn over to exodus chapter 5. so so moses comes down meets the pillar of fire gets the commandments so now he's following the leadership of the pillar of fire the leadership of god and he comes down in chapter five we'll go to verse 19. and he makes he he steps in and he and he speaks to pharaoh and he says let my people go and and pharaoh doesn't like this so he says you know the people are lazy they're listening to moses and air and they want to go worship and he says you know uh uh take away their straw make them find their own straw in their own stubble we're going to make it harder for them but the but the allotment of bricks each day cannot diminish one brick so everything gets more difficult and they they take the rulers of israel that they had set over israel and the task masters begin to beat them because they can't keep up and those and those rulers they go and approach the pharaoh and say pharaoh you know this isn't fair we can't meet the quota and he says you've been lazy because you've been listening to moses and want to go worship you go do it again and so everything's working just right on time but it's all a big mess everything's just a big mess moses heard from god moses met a pillar of fire the angel of the lord amen he heard from god and god told him to go down and deliver them amen this should have been a piece of cake with such a mighty sign with such a mighty word he should have went down and it should have went smooth amen but it didn't go so smooth and so moses he runs into the officers of the children of israel in verse 19 chapter 5 verse 19 and the officers of the children of israel did see that they were in an evil case after it was said you shall not diminish ought from your bricks or of your daily task and they met moses and aaron who stood in the way as they came forth from pharaoh and they said unto them the lord look upon you in judge because you have made our our savior to be a board in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants to put a sword in their hand to slay us and moses returned unto the lord and said lord wherefore hast thou sow evil and treated this people why is it that thou has sent me he begins to question because god met him and told him what to do and god even told him that pharaoh won't listen to you but when but when the people that he came to deliver begin to judge moses and question moses and he's seen the hardship and he's seen everything going the wrong way he begins to question god again the very god of heaven who told him he starts in human reasoning he starts to question god again he said why has thou so evilly entreated this people god why why when i did what you said to do why did it get worse why when i obeyed your commandment i had a i mean we had a mighty experience do you understand what the experience at the burning bush must have been like a mighty experience that would move moses out and moses was going out to be the deliverer and he says you'll bring my people out of egypt and you'll bring them to this mountain to worship amen that was a mighty prophecy but when he goes in the fulfillment of the prophecy in obedience to the pillar of fire leadership amen it goes the wrong direction and that's a common thing in life friends when you begin to follow god at the leadership of the holy ghost in your life and you're sure that you're doing what god led you to do you can rest assured there's going to come tests because god is going to test our faith amen don't just expect everything to part and move out of your way because god told me and god led me to do if god led you to do then god is going to ask you to have faith in what he told you to do personally and you're going to have to face opposition and it very well may go the opposite direction of what you expected when you walk down but rest assure god is just setting the circumstances up for his glory [Applause] moses goes to ask the question these are good things to remind ourselves of we know these things we know them forward and backward but friends we're starting to live it [Applause] we've seen it happen through our lives but we're going to see it happen more and more and more we are going to have to stand on the leadership of the pillar of fire and not flinch in the face of all obstacles in the face of all opposition and pieces falling and the everything falling apart and chaos breaking out and you say god i thought you told me hey just because everything goes contrary doesn't mean he didn't tell you [Applause] praise god amen this is the way we're going to live this is the way we're going to overcome why hast thou so evenly entreated this people why is it that thou has sent me he starts to even question what god told him he starts to even question his commission he starts to question his holy ghost leadership have you ever been there where you're sure god's leading you to do something you go to do it amen and even the people you try to help amen they get mad at you does that ever happen misunderstand what you're saying get angry at you i'll blame you because it didn't work out well and then you begin to question even your commission why has thou sent me verse 23 for since i came to pharaoh to speak to in thy name he hath done evil to this people neither hast thou delivered the people at all god it didn't work it didn't work you told me i mean moses may start questioning himself did i really see a pill or fire i mean would i did i really take off and he's got to go back through the experience how can we say things like that because every one of us has been here you've got to go back through and say no it was god i mean it was god i know it was god i know that experience was real i know it was true he says why hast thou sent me for when i spoke to pharaoh what you told me he evenly treated the people and thou hasn't delivered them lord did you really think it was going to be easy praise be to god chapter 6 verse 1 then the lord said unto moses now shalt thou see what i will do to pharaoh. for with a strong hand shall he let them go and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land god didn't want it to be easy god didn't want it to be a little show of his power god didn't want it to be just a a light thing but god wanted to show himself mighty and he wanted to show himself a god of all the earth of heaven and earth and god he got all of this is in his control he didn't want pharaoh to let him go the first time in fact if you read through this he hardens his heart and hardens his heart and hardens his heart and pharaoh gets to the place where pharaoh says i will now let them go but god hardens his heart because god doesn't want it to come easy because god wants to show how powerful and how mighty he is and he wants to utterly destroy egypt [Music] sometimes when things are going wrong and they keep going wrong god is setting a trap for the devil the devil's not setting a trap for you we got to have confidence in the leadership of god when we're following by the leadership of the holy ghost following the word of god amen as god gave it to us through a prophet amen and we're following after what what brother branham has brought us what god has showed us to be true and we're following that in faith amen and things go wrong god is setting up something to show his power he's setting up the circumstances to show his glory amen is nothing is going wrong but we can start questioning lord why did you even send me lord you didn't say the brother said if i do this this will happen your word says if i do this this will happen yeah it's true but he never said what will happen in between if you do this this will happen yes absolutely 100 true that's the word but all the things that happen in between god's in control of that too it will come to pass they were leaving egypt under a mighty hand they were coming back to horup to worship at that mountain but everything that happened in between god had control of that too amen and god's told us something we can hold fast to that it'll come to pass but there may be a lot of things in between that he hasn't told us yet but that doesn't change his word and that doesn't change the leadership of god praise the lord let's go to exodus 13. we'll skip all the plagues all the things that happen now he lets them go egypt is destroyed because god wanted to destroy them for ten plagues he hardened pharaoh's heart so that he can keep destroying egypt and keep destroying egypt and keep destroying egypt because god wanted to destroy egypt so every time moses would do what god told him to do a plague would break out and no doubt the children of israel when they see the plague they say definitely this time definitely after this we're going to get to go and go with heart and pharaoh's heart he wouldn't let them go and then something else would happen and you can just imagine just put yourself there you've been under bondage under the taskmaster and now all of a sudden supernatural things are happening like you've never seen before in your lifetime and you're seeing egypt brought to its knees you're seeing the whole world system change and you think surely this time amen this time everything will change and it didn't change because there's another one coming and another one coming and another one coming because god wants to destroy egypt he doesn't want to give him a little whipping he wants to destroy them so it never goes like we expect it to go i think if we've served god any amount of time we can come to that conclusion it has never gone the way we expected it to go but god has never failed to keep his word in chapter 13 we'll go to verse 20. they're leaving egypt now they've spoiled them now verse 20 says and they took their journey from sukkoth and encamped and eat them in the edge of the wilderness and the lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud and led them and led them the way and by night in the pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people so now they go out under direct leadership direct leadership of the pillar of fire direct leadership of the pillar of fire can't go wrong is that right but it can look like it goes wrong let's go to chapter 14 verse 10. and when pharaoh drew nigh the children of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of israel cried out unto the lord and they said unto moses because there was no graves in egypt has thou taken us away to die in the wilderness listen friends they just saw some of the most supernatural things they've ever seen in their life they've seen some of the most supernatural things that have ever taken place on the face of the earth from that time to this time they've seen a sequence of events that some of the most supernatural happenings that have ever happened amen and here they are just a short time days maybe a couple of days later now they get into another obstacle and they go out singing and dancing spoiling their neighbors borrowing gold borrowing jewels barring raymond loading up their beasts taking everything out as a mighty victorious army in a battle they did not fight god did it all they didn't have to do anything god sent the prophet amen god sent moses along to do it all they had nothing to do with it all they had to do is sit and wait for their deliverance you remember they weren't even required to believe in it it didn't matter how much they doubted god said he was going to do it and god did it they could have been doubting all along but god gave his word and god was going to do it and they it wasn't their mighty faith that got them out it was the word of god and led them out a mighty army and here they are just a couple days later no doubt rejoicing in the camp we're free we're happy people we've got gold we've got jewels we've got raymond and they were told to take the raiment and put it on their sons and their daughters everybody leaves rich but now they turn and look and pharaoh and his armies coming and like that they forgot what god had just done they were still carnal earthly believers all they could see is what they could see and all they could know is what they could know and they said let's read this verse 10 again when pharaoh june 9 the children of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of israel cried on to the lord and they said unto moses because there was no graves in egypt has thou taken us away to die in the wilderness god didn't take him to die in the wilderness that was not the promise that was not the prophecy they had already lost faith in the word of god because of the circumstances because it was impossible because they were up against a mountain on one side amen they were they were wedged in by mountains amen and they were wedged against the sea and the only route of escape was the place that the egyptians were coming right down and because with their natural eyes they could see no way of escape they begin to throw away the word of god how quickly human beings follow the same path therefore has thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of egypt is not just the word that we did tell thee in egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness now listen when god come to moses he says i have heard the cry of my people by reason of their tax masters and i have seen their affliction they were crying for deliverance and god gave them deliverance and when it looked like that they would die in the wilderness they said no it was better for us to be bondage it was better for us to be in egypt but yet they were the ones crying for god to deliver them they had forgot their own prayer they had forgot their own request this is god gave them exactly what they were praying for and when god led them to the wilderness amen again and exactly exactly fulfilling what he had promised that to the t and their request he had come down and delivered them because they were crying for deliverance now they threw away their prayer now they threw away the prophecy to save their natural lives and fear of losing their natural lives friends i would have rather died right there by the seaside a free man than to go back into egypt i'd have rather known that god delivered me according to my prayer and according to his word and died right there like a man facing all of pharaoh and all of his armies than to say it was better for me to be back in the denominational systems i'd rather die believing this message i'd rather die standing with the prophet than to go back into the system to go back to be a common believer to believe in just common theology and have no faith in amen and waver every time circumstances change i'd rather die facing down the devil than to go back to where we came from they they were willing to go backwards to spare their natural life let me lose my natural life to keep marching forward because i can't die the sixth dimension is waiting for me if i go before the translation of the body but don't ever let me say it was better if this never had happened to me it doesn't matter how bad the circumstance is getting and they're going to get worse but let us take our place in the army of the lord and not throw away our very prayer requests and the prayer requests and the prayers of the church ages down to seven church ages that are stored up in vials that have been poured out when the lamb took the book let's not stomp on that to try to save a natural life or to make things easier for ourselves but let's face it as it is amen troubles are coming trouble's worse than what we have now persecution is coming this we haven't even seen persecution yet all we've seen a tightening up of the system maybe a little financial pressure and maybe a little a government pressure on us naturally but nothing spiritually yet no persecution yet we might as well face it now [Applause] amen praise god i'd rather stand on the promises of god and if i lose my natural life so be it but i want to die a believer in the deliverance of god holding the title deed in my hand praise be to god praise god verse 13 and moses said unto the people fear ye not what was their problem they were afraid fear has such a power on human beings fear hath torment and the things that were coming out of their mouth was shocking because they were afraid because they were afraid they would have rather been back in the system serving the task masters because they were afraid because they were afraid they regretted their prayers being answered they regretted the prophet coming and they regretted being delivered because of the pressure because of the fear you see what fear will do to us if we let it override us jesus said to his disciples let not your heart be troubled when he said that he's telling them don't let your heart be troubled there's a praise place prepared for you you're just fine don't let your heart get away from you don't let fear overtake you resist it in the name of jesus christ stand against it don't let fear come in don't submit to it don't dwell on it don't give it a place in your mind but you arrest it and you bring it captive and you toss it out because once you go give yourself over to fear you'll be shocked at the things that come out of your mind and mouth and the unbelief that will spew out just because we're afraid of something happening or afraid of the circumstances that are around us afraid that it might get to us and we'll start spewing unbelief unbelief unbelief unbelief because of fear and we're gonna forget the very promise that is written in this book that we base our whole salvation and life on because of fear we've got to guard against it and moses said unto the people fear you not stand still and see the salvation of the lord fear not stand still when you've done all to stand stand with the whole armor on stand because there's nothing you can do about it anyways but you might as well stand on the word and let the one who can change all circumstances change all circumstances when the one who can deliver when it's impossible to be delivered he's done it before won't he do it again he's done it for us he's done it for us over and over again we've heard the testimonies we've shared testimonies with one another won't he do it again [Applause] amen all of those testimonies we have is just to bring us into a higher place in faith in a higher place in faith in a higher amendment it's not so that we can save a testimony it's not a merit badge that we earn in boy scouts amen it's trying and testing and overcoming so that we can stand amen we can stand the worst of the worst of the worst and what's going on in our world right now what's going on all around us amen is another test for us to overcome so that we can stand a little higher for what comes next said unto the people fear ye not stand still see the salvation of the lord which he will show to you today for the egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever they wanted to go back to bondage at the point of their deliverance at the point that they will be delivered from the egyptians forever the pressure got so intense at that moment the moment of deliverance that they feared and they were willing to throw it all away to go back to the taskmasters what do you think it's going to be like in this hour of deliverance probably not going to be a sunday school picnic the egyptians who you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever the lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace and the lord said unto moses wherefore christ down to me speak unto the children of israel that they go forward but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea let's go to psalm 77 keep your place in exodus we're coming back but just go over to the book of psalm 77. psalm 77 14 the psalmist speaking of deliverance out of egypt verse 14 thou art the god that does wonders thou has declared thy strength among the people thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people the sons of jacob and joseph sila and the water saw thee oh god the water saw thee they were afraid the depths also were troubled the clouds poured out water the sky sent out a sound thine arrows also went abroad the voice of thy thunder was in the heaven the lightnings lighted the world the earth trembled and shook thy way is in the sea and thy path in the great waters and thy footsteps are not known thou led us thy people like a flock by the hand of moses and aaron let's go back to exodus he's saying thy ways are in the water thy path is not known you see god made no mistake when the pillar of fire led them he led them exactly to the place he wanted them to be now nothing in their earthly senses declared that that was the right spot and moses didn't even know that that was the right spot in a carnal way in his own human mind he didn't know there was the right spot he just knew god was going to deliver him but he didn't know that this was the right spot he just know god was going to deliver them brother branham says in the message conference from 1960 the whosoever will let him come and and right in the line of duty you'll hit the blockade oh i guess all nature just quivered why look what a thing here was moses and israel right in the line of duty with a pillar of fire leading them and led them right down into a trap god likes to get his people in traps praise be to god god it look brother man said it looked like he was a bad general pillar of fire but listen friends if you're following the pillar of fire which to us is the holy ghost because that pillar of fire broke up on the day of pentecost amen and it went into the individuals and now there's individual holy ghost leadership and that holy ghost is leading and guiding you into all truth not your own way his way amen to the revelation of jesus christ in this hour but if that pillar of fire is leading you then that pillar of fire is responsible to get you all the way there it's responsible for every turn and every deliverance all your protection and everything you need is the holy ghost is responsible for it because the holy ghost is leading you and if the holy ghost has led you into a trap then the trap is the safest place to be [Music] look look read the bible how many times amen did the situation get impossible how many times did god lead them to the impossible how many times did god lead them in such a way that there's no way out over and over and over and over again because that's always the hour of deliverance god is setting a trap he's laying an ambush for his enemy not laying not sending you to the enemy's ambush you're just debate are you comfortable being debate it just depends on how good a shot your father is if you're bear bait and you're sitting out in the woods waiting for the bear to come and your father's 200 yards over you better have confidence your dad's a good shot and our father's a good yes shot israel was debate because god was going to destroy pharaoh's army and he moved in their heart to come chase them down they were defenseless they were helpless they were completely incapable of any they were good bait they were like a chicken in the face of a wolf but pharaoh didn't know that god was a good shot and he had a path in the water and he had to get them to this certain spot because this trap wasn't for israel this trap was for pharaoh and his army haman built a gallow for mordecai but it was never intended to be used on mordecai haman built his own gallow that he would hang from the devils tried to lay a trap for this bride and all he's going to do is get trapped in his own trap but we're going to have to stay humble and reverent and in action amen and it may get worse and it may look bad amen it may look like everything fell apart just like it did in jesus ministry jesus had lost his ministry in the eyes of human eye and the human beings he he was finished all of his disciples scattered amen the seventy had left and the multitudes have left him the whole nation now had turned against him and crying out for his blood amen and when they come to arrest him amen his very closest friends and disciples vanished and deserted him he had lost everything but that was the trap he set for the devil that wasn't the trap for the son of god that was the trap for the devil because he was waiting for that little bee of death to come by amen he was looking helpless and looking weak and looking like a little lamb nailed to the cross he was at the subject of roman soldiers and then he had been spit on and being mocked and his beard ripped out of his face and he could have destroyed them all with the move of his finger but he laid there like a helpless lamb why because he was setting a trap for the devil and when the devil saw that this man has no power this man can't do anything he brought that little bee of death around and when it stuck inside of him he grabbed a hold of the stinger and he said i got you now and he pulled the sting of death out so that we could have eternal life and if he did it then he'll do it again [Music] don't be afraid when everything looks bad the trap's not for you the traps for the devil and god's going to do in such a way only he can get the glory he's the only one that can get glory that you're you'll be so you'll be so uh you'll be so confused and so unsure in your carnal mind of what's happening the only thing that'll hold is the anchor in the soul and standing on the word of god but it won't be ability it won't be the ability in the mind or the ability in the flesh we'll be down to where there's nothing humidly we can do about it amen but stand having done all to stand stand [Music] [Applause] don't fear stand still and see the salvation of the lord god likes to get his people in traps we're back in conference see what they'll do every son that cometh to god must first be tried and chastened he gets them there he brings you here he puts you in between opinions now could that be mental to lefty could it be see he puts you in a trap to see what kind of decision you're going to make that's right search the scriptures jesus said they are they that testify on me that's right now god lets it get that way now he brought israel right into the trap mountains and deserts on both sides pharaoh army pursuing thousands of chariots and spears and a bunch of humble little poor slaves not armed with nothing come down to the dead sea or the red sea rather right down to its banks and here was the dust of the chariots coming and here was the mountains on either side no way looked like god was a bad military man left his people with no retreat praise god because their retreat was right through that ocean it was right through the red sea but nobody on the earth knew it seemed like he looked like a god was a bad military man left his people no retreat sometimes he does that let the doctor walk away and say you ain't going to live you're going to die that cancer is going to kill you you'll never get up out of that chair he seemed like he leaves you with no retreat but he is your retreat climb back into his arms god he's my refuge he's my mighty tower the name of the lord is a mighty tower the righteous run into and are safe the towers of refuge he is our refuge no other refuge have i but him i don't want i i don't want to know any other refuge he's my refuge he is my rock and a weary land a shelter in the time of storm i don't want any other refuge the the government's trying to pass a 2 trillion dollar bailout it won't bail out anything the only bailout is a translation praise the lord brother bram says speak to the rock and it shall give forth its water in 1960. they they had seen ten powerful miracles performed down in egypt flies lice fire death angel all they had seen in egypt all these great miracles that they had seen god do and were still carnal thinkers and then they saw the red sea that was laying in the path of duty they were on their road marching then come out there was a pillar of fire before them and they marched on to the red sea and when they got there right in the line of duty laid an obstacle and first thing you know fear struck them and they didn't know what to do that's the way people does today when fear strikes them when they're right in the path of duty listen brother let me say this if you're walking in the light are you walking in the light having fellowship with god in his people and the holy spirit is upon you you meet an obstacle right in the path of duty don't stop just keep pressing on god will make a way through it these are the stipulations you've got to be walking in the light not a previous light because that's not light today it's got to be the light man the manifested word for this hour walking in the light having fellowship with god and his people and the holy spirit is upon you if you've got that and you've got confidence in that and the holy ghost is leading you when you meet an obstacle don't get scared don't back down you just stay right there and keep pressing god is going to make a way so that's the way people does today when fear strikes them when they're right in the path of duty listen brother let me say this if you're walking in the light have fellowship with god with his people and the holy spirit is upon you you meet an obstacle right in the path of duty don't stop just keep pressing on god will make a way through it that's one of the greatest experiences of my life is to see god when i can't get over it get under it get around it or any way god opens up a way and i go through it somehow or another his grace is sufficient to carry us through it has he ever done that for you if he did it once he'll do it again and if he did it for you if i can come under the same conditions with the same faith he'll do it for me is that right so if he did it for you and if he did it for the children of israel and if he did it for the three hebrew children and if he did it for daniel and the lions and if he did it for each one of them when they met the conditions in the path of duty if he did it for them if i can come the same way they came when the same condition with the same faith he'll do it for me praise god let's go back to exodus 15. exodus 15 and 22. so moses brought israel from the red sea and they went out into the wilderness of sure and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water and when they came to tomorrow they could not drink of the waters of mara for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called mara and the people murmured against moses saying what shall we drink and he cried unto the lord and the lord showed him a tree which when he had cast it into the waters the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statue and an ordinance and there he proved them and said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the lord thy god and we'll do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to his commandments and keep all the statutes i will put none of these diseases upon thee which i have brought upon the egyptians for i am the lord that healeth thee do you believe that you've got to keep his word he said you've got to keep you keep my word and if we keep his word he'll keep it see they went three days journey from the red sea three days and they couldn't find water and they begin to murmur and complain and cry out against moses say what are we going to drink there's no water god had just moved thousands and thousands of gallons of water and parted it where it stood up like a wall on the right hand and on the left hand and they didn't go on on mushy ground or wet ground they went across on dry ground and three days later they're asking moses this water's bitter where are we going to get water my goodness what happens to us human beings see they were stuck in a slave mind in a slave mind they couldn't do anything for themselves they just took the conditions as they were and just grumbled and complained about it but god is trying to train them out of that into something else and he brought them there to prove them and he's bringing them from one test to the next test to the next test and if you watch the progression through the exodus journey amen the punishment gets greater and greater with each test that they fail because they're supposed to be growing up when they come to the red sea and they're up against it they begin to cry out god doesn't punish them is that right he just makes a way for them and explains to them don't be afraid stand still and see the salvation of god they go across three days later when they cry out he says hey i'll take care of this he shows him a tree cuts it and puts it in the water turns its sweet and says i've done this to prove you to test you to prove to you now if you'll keep my word i want to show you something now i'm telling you i can heal this water and if i can heal this water i can heal you i'm the lord that healeth all thy diseases but as they march on the more tests the more severe the punishment because he's trying to mature them into a place of maturity to know how to trust him and keep his word and follow the pillar of fire he speaks in redemption and completeness and joy 1954 he said let's look into this i see him i got one prescription i'm the lord that healeth thee that settled it amen said oh moses my father has been over here he just fell and broke his leg what have you got for him let me look and see if thou obey my voice do all my commandment i'll put none of these diseases upon you as the egyptians for i am the lord that healeth thee tell him that he got well amen that's right brother brother dr moses is writing the prescription keep the commandments obey the word you've done that okay i'm the god that healeth thee go tell him that he got well amen oh he's seriously sick my baby has got colic or pneumonia so bad dr moses what can i do let me see what i got i am the lord to heal at thee that settles it amen away they went going on rejoicing that's all he needed i'm the lord that healeth thee moses wrote the prescription it's still good today i'm the lord that healeth thee keep his commandments obey the word of god he's the lord that healeth thee hebrews chapter 4 19 57 brother brahman says now they were following moses as moses followed the pillar and cloud and they were on their way to the promised land beautiful picture of the church tonight on our way to the promised land led by the same spirit same signs and wonders as god spoke of now notice then they come to the wilderness of sin the waters were bitter mara why did god lead them to the bitter waters looks like he'd have led them to good water but he led them to bitter water so he could prove their faith has he ever led you to bitter waters of troubles need he's proving your faith he led him to bitter water so he could prove their faith he likes to do it listen we might as well get comfortable with this fact he likes to do it he he'll lead you to a trap amen because he likes to show himself mighty on your behalf he'll lead you to bitter waters to prove you he likes to do it brother baby said god loves to prove his children [Music] he likes to do it he likes to let tribulations come on you now listen i didn't say that the prophet of god said that he likes to let tribulations come on you get comfortable with that fact right now might as well just get comfortable with that because if we don't get comfortable with that the next time tribulations come we're going to be like moses god why did you send me here why is all this happening hey nothing's out of kilter all these things have to be this way the clock's ticking just right on time these things have to be like this god likes to let tribulations come on you show he can so he can show you his love and his power when the tribulations come start looking up because he wants to show you his love and his power that's the time to start getting excited amen when there's no way out of this when the trouble is coming hot and fast and i can't figure out what to do about it but i know i'm in the line of duty i know i'm right with god i've searched my life i know i'm where i'm supposed to be with him i know i'm in the light of the hour i know the holy ghost is upon me now i'm going to watch for his deliverance how can people today who doesn't believe in the miracle working of god when tribulations come they just give up and go on but we believe that god works miracles listen to this if god doesn't act the same then the same circumstances arise then god is guilty of being partial to his people this is good news friends well the prophet is telling us right now is really good news because we all have a bible and we can all read the bible and we can all read the message and we go back to this he says if god doesn't act the same when the same circumstances arise then god is guilty of being partial to his people god's sovereignty demands of him to work in every case like he did the first case or he was wrong when he worked in the first case if god does not act in the same way he did on the first case if he will act different to the second case then he acted wrong when he acted on the first case if god healed the sick in the old testament he's got to do it in the new testament and today or he did wrong when he healed them back there he's got to act the same every time and he will do it when the same faith meets the condition the fault is in us not in god when the same faith meets to the condition he'll do it the fault's never his exodus 16 verse 4 we're we're following the children of egypt and all these experiences where god is testing them and proving them now we'll look at this one in exodus 16 4. then said the lord unto moses behold i will reign bread from heaven for you and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day that i may prove them whether they will walk in my law or no this is a different kind of test now he's going to test them in greed and in prosperity he's tested them in the face of armies in the face of lack and need and now they've lacked bread and they need bread they needed water he provided water he tested them there they needed deliverance from armies he provided deliverance from armies and now they need bread he gives them bread but he gives an abundance of bread and he's going to give them rules to gathering this bread only so much per person only so much for a family and on the sixth day you gather enough for two days don't take too much because it'll spoil every test we get isn't always hardship sometimes our tests are prosperity will we keep his word with the abundance or will greed set in god is trying to train them in all things and god is trying to train us in all things let's go to numbers 21. numbers 21 verse 4. and they journeyed from mount hore by the way of the red sea to compass the land of edom and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way god is leading them to the promised land and they're discouraged because it's a hard way and god is leading us to the promised land don't get discouraged because it's a hard way and the people spake against god and against moses wherefore have you brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loatheth this light bread and the lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of israel died you see everything's beginning to change as he's starting to mature his church when they come against the red sea they were just just fresh out of slavery and bondage just fresh out and god made a way for them they went through and they sang and dance on the other side and three days later they're crying again because no water but it's okay he heals the water and proves to them that he can heal them gives them a promise and then they go a little bit further and have no more bread and they cry out and he gives them bread and he's going to test them in the giving of bread to make sure that they're not greedy and they'll still keep his word but now they come to another test when they when they begin to grumble and complain because the way is hard because when they come out of slavery amen they had the promise that he's going to give them a promised land that floweth with milk and honey and all they could think of was the milk and honey but they never thought of paying a price to get to the milk and honey they didn't know it was going to require anything of them they didn't know that they were going to have to go through tribulation and trouble and hardship in a difficult way and be tested and be tried they just thought that i'm going to get the milk and honey amen the pillar of fire is here the prophet is here we're just going to get the milk and honey but to get to the milk and honey you've got to pass the test you've got to endure the wilderness journey you've got to stay true to the word amen you've got to obey god you've got to do what he's leading you to do not too much not too little but stay true to his word and now god was reigning manna from heaven and they got tired of the message and they wanted to spice it up a little bit they wanted a little something else to go with they cried for meat one time and they got quails until it was coming out their nose and a plague came with it and now they said now we don't have any good bread they had bread god gave them exactly what they needed amen they went out there was not a feeble one among them through the journey this bread was the bread that kept them healthy and kept them strong amen and moved them on the journey and they began to loathe this light bread and they wanted a little something extra to spice it up a little bit something to go with it something else amen make it a little more appealing a little more appetizing get it get it let's get a little bit excited let's have a little bit of a show amen it doesn't need a show just take the bread that's coming from heaven and feed on it because it's going to give us strength for the journey and there won't be a feeble manga one one among us spiritually it will just take the bread from heaven we don't have to alter it and we don't have to spice it up we don't have to make it more exciting we don't have to put a program together we don't have to have a special camp we don't have to spice up the music just take the bread that he's given us and eat that bread every day for the journey [Music] friends we've been given everything we need but it was never going to be a sunday school picnic because god is trying to instill in his bright character for reigning and he was trying to take this nation of slaves and he was going to give them a land and make them the rulers over the land but he couldn't pluck them out as slaves and stick them as rulers of the land they would have no idea what to do they needed to be trained and how to manage the land they needed to be trained and how to be disciplined they needed to learn to work they needed to learn to obey they needed to learn to trust or they would have lost the land and 50 some years ago we weren't ready to take the millennium god has been training his bride through all kinds of circumstances and training her why because we're going to rule over the land with christ and he's getting us in position to rule over that land amen no more crying about hardship no more crying about things not working out but now's the time to trust now is the time to believe the word now is the time to stand knowing that you've done all to stand now stand and see the salvation of the lord now it's time to expect the miraculous because we did what he told us to do now he'll do what he's done before isn't the time to be a slave isn't the time to be a child this is a different age friends and we know that they finally come to katis barnea and in katie's barnea the expression of unbelief was so great that god would not forgive that generation but he would smite every one of them saving caleb and joshua why what was the difference caleb and joshua fully believed the promise the other ones partially believed the promise but when they went to spy out the land and they saw that it was going to require effort and hardship to take the land they said it's too much for us we can't take this land but caleb he had faith in the promise of god he didn't have faith in his ability he had faith in what moses had told him that god had said and he said would we be more than able to take the life god if god be with us we're more than able to take this land he was looking at the word they were looking at the circumstances amen and they they then they got so angry with moses amen they wanted to form a captain to go back to egypt again why because egypt was easy we're told what to do we do what we're told to do we do it every way hey the flesh pots were full and we had bread to eat and garlic and leeks and everything else what was it no personal responsibility no personal suffering and no growth back in the systems no growth no spiritual growth at all stay here you work for the system we feed you what you're supposed to eat and there's plenty of this food oh give me the light bread give me a daily dose of the light bread that comes from heaven i don't need a program i don't need a system i don't need something spicy just give me that bread that came from god and the message of the hour and let me eat it every day of my life lord and help me to overcome every obstacle by your grace so god made a change at cadiz barnea this generation isn't going in but there's going to be a new generation go in and this generation isn't the generation with a slave mindset but this is a generation that's come up in freedom amen and they don't want to go back you notice this new generation no matter what they face they never one time asked to go back to egypt and what happens they watch more tests and more trials after cadish barnea they see cora dathan and the byron rise up now it's not an outside pressure coming in it's not starvation or hunger or need for water or armies now there's spirits rising up right inside the church trying to correct the prophet trying to be equal to the prophet of god and watch them fall into the earth go from there amen to load the bread the loathe the loath this this word that god has delivered through a seventh grade educated prophet and want something to put with it put a little maybe cayenne pepper or something they saw the fiery serpent strike them what's he doing god is teaching this new generation born free don't do like that don't go this way don't go that way and the consequences get more severe and more severe and more severe until balaam teaches balak how to entice him into mixed religion again accepting things from the denomination that they never should have accepted forms of denominational worship they never should have accepted and a plague broke out among them and phineas stopped the plague you see what's happening the next generation is watching and learning and experiencing through all the troubles when it comes time to cross to the other side to take the promised land god takes moses off the scene and he leads them across by by joshua the type of the holy ghost because the holy ghost is going to place each one individually in their place everybody is going to come to their adoption everybody under the ministry of the holy ghost is going to come to their place and they're going to know where they belong and they're going to know what they're supposed to be doing and they're going to be operating and functioning individually under the leadership of the holy ghost it's no longer amen what moses can do moses can do moses can do but now when joshua moves in it's not what moses does and it's not what joshua does joshua gets the orders from the head captain joshua gives the orders to the camp and the camp acts it out it wasn't joshua amen that had to hold his arms up to win a battle for jericho coming down it was the whole army that had to march around seven times this is now going to start involving the whole camp amen and now when one man sins aiken the whole camp suffers when that one man sins when joshua the holy ghost begins to root it out the whole camp acts together to destroy that thing and get it moved away from them things are different with that new generation when joshua says do something they do it they don't murmur they don't complain when he says be circumcised or circumcised when he says stay back and watch when the waters park what they do exactly as he says do when they say march around and keep silent amen for six days and on the seventh don't say a word to this they do exactly like he says do and whenever they follow the leadership of joshua it works out perfect where did they learn this kind of obedience by what they had watched over the 40-year journey as everybody else had fallen and died what has god been trying to do for us get us into a position we can be an army like that when the holy ghost says move we move but he says be quiet we're quiet when he says wait to cross we wait to cross if he says be circumcised and get rid of the extra flesh will you circumcise again and get rid of the extra flesh he's getting an army amen that'll do what he said do and when joshua says there's sin in the camp amen they'll go through until they find the sin and then they all work together not just joshua but everybody stoned them to death this is this was serious now this was a serious army that was moving in to take the land they were moving under the promises they were moving under the leadership and they were moving by the holy ghost it's a different day a different generation let's go to mark chapter six mark chapter six let's go to verse 34. and jesus when he came out he saw much people and was moved with compassion toward them because they were a sheep not having a shepherd and he began to teach them many things and when the day was now far spent his disciples came unto him and said this is a desert place and now the time is far past send them away that they may go into the country round about into the villages and buy themselves bread for they have nothing to eat and i just want to inject here over in john 6 he picks up the same story and i want to read to you the same thing out of john 6 but keep your place here in mark we're going to finish it here john 6 and 5 when jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him he saith unto philip when shall we buy bread that these may eat and this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do see god already knows what he's going to do and many times he gets us in a place where he's going to prove us but he already knows what he's going to do and we have to know he already knows what he's going to do but he's waiting for us to say something he's waiting for us to make our decision he's waiting for us to stand on the word and he's going to do what he's going to do but he's trying to prove something teach us get us to move get us in action do something god's trying to do something through every circumstance we've got to be thoroughly convinced of that from here on out every circumstance that we face that we need god to move on the scene god is trying to do something we've got to come to terms with the fact that i'm not lost i'm not wayward i'm not out of his will if you have those questions in doubt settle them tonight repent make everything right be led by the spirit of god know that you're under the token know that your life is lined up to the word of god know that there's nothing between you and god settle that question now so it doesn't come up the next time we have trouble some at some point we've got to face this thing down and say god is there anything wrong with me show me now because i've got to know that i'm right with you i got to know that i'm under the token i got to know that the token's on display and then i'm obedient to your word and there's nothing hindering you're moving in my life and when you can walk away from that prayer and you know with confidence and assurance amen that god dwells within and there's nothing between you and him amen every time we face an obstacle don't let the devil whisper in your ear you're out of the will of god you're not even a child of god he doesn't even care settle that issue now because we're going to face the situations where the devil's going to whisper that in your ear and you better already come to terms with that that way we can stand and see the salvation of the lord say i didn't put myself in this place god led me here i didn't make myself what i am god led me here i hey i didn't find the message the message found me i didn't make myself a believer he predestinated me to believe this message i don't believe it because of intellect because i've got intellectual reasons not to i believe it because i can't help believe it it's inside of me it's who i am whatever this word is is what i am whatever's coming across that tape is the same thing that's sounding inside of me i'm not a believer by choice i'm not a believer by intellect i'm not a believer by education i'm a believer by predestination i can't not believe this message [Music] that's what we come to terms with friends we didn't put ourselves here god led us here we didn't make ourselves believer he predestinated before the foundation of the world when when we he knew we were the seed gene of god that would come forth in this age we were predisposed to connect with the word for this age and when the word for this age came in contact with the sea gene for this age it sparked the life and you couldn't control it [Applause] you're not still standing here because it's been the most convenient way to believe you're not still standing here because it's been nothing but blessings you're still standing and believing because you can't help but believe now we just need to fully surrender to the word fully obey the word amen and march forth with confidence that god's leading me in any place he turns me whatever obstacle i face there's something he wants to accomplish he's either training me teaching me defeating the devil showing himself mighty whatever it is but he's not going to give me to question my sonship because everything goes wrong everything went wrong for moses matter of fact everything went wrong for jesus carnally speaking everything went wrong but everything was working right he said that to prove them for he himself knew what he would do god already knows what he's going to do whatever situation you find yourself in tonight he already knows what he's going to do he's just wanting to see what you'll do now it's time to act like a believer philip answered him 200 penny worth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little now let's go back to verse 38 or verse 37. he and i'm sorry in mark 6 mark 6 37 and he answered and said unto them give you them to eat and they say unto him shall we go and buy 200 penny worth of bread and give them to eat and he saith to them how many loaves have you go and see and when they knew they saved five and two fishes and he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass and they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties and when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes he looked up to heaven and blessed and break the loaves and gave them to his disciples to set before them and the two fishes divided he among them all and they did all they eat and were filled and they took up 12 basketfuls of fragments and of fishes and they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men verse 45 and straightway he constrained his disciples to get into a ship you all know the story but i want you to read the terminology he straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship who's in control of this situation who told who to get in the ship this is the key to the whole thing friends if the pillar of fire leads you the pillar of fire must take responsibility for you for whatever shepherds you must care for you and if the holy ghost is shepherding you then the holy ghost must take care of you remember as the pillar of fire amen it was the pillar of fire who led them to the trap it was the pillar of the fire that went back behind them and became a wall of defense so that they could get through the red sea if christ told them to get in the ship then christ had to take care of them while they were in the ship because they were walking in obedience to the leadership of the lord this is where our confidence has to come friends that we're walking in obedience to the leadership of the lord if the lord has led you then the lord will take care of you all the way to the end it doesn't matter how many storms come up or how much trouble comes if he led you into the ship it doesn't matter if it looks like the ship is going the wrong way or if everything's coming undone you remember who led you to the ship reflect back and remember who led me to this ship who told me to get into this message ship amen it was the lord himself constrained me to get into this message ship because this ship is going to the other side and he said get into this ship he constrained me to get into this strip who constrained you to get into this shell straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship and to go to the other side before into beseda while he sent away the people and we had sent them away he departed into a mountain to pray and when even was come the ship was in the midst of the sea and he alone on the land and he saw them toiling and rowing for the wind was contrary unto them huh imagine that the wind was contrary to them do you think in this ship we might ever face days where the wind will be contrary the wind was contrary to them and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them walking upon the sea and it would have passed by them when they saw him walking upon the sea they supposed it had been a spirit and cried out for they all saw him and were troubled and immediately he talked with them and said unto them be of good cheer it is i be not afraid who was in control of the storm it was him who was responsible for delivering them the one who told him to get in the ship see friends if we could just reflect back on who told us to get in this ship who told you to get in this ship was it your mom your dad a friend a spouse because if they're the ones who told you to get in the ship when the wind becomes the contrary and the thing's about to sing they're the ones who are going to have to take care of you if it was your best friend if it was your wife or your husband or your mom or your dad or you're here because of one of your kids constrain you to get in the ship if that's the reason you're in the boat i'm telling you contrary winds are starting to blow and the sea is going to get tossed and whoever told you to get in the boat is the one who's going to have to make provision for you and take care of you and you better rest assured that the one who puts you in the boat is the one who can meet you in the midst of the sea by walking on the water it better not be anything fleshly or nothing of this world but it better be god who's led you into this word and god who led you into this place because if the holy ghost led you here then the holy ghost has to take you all the way through i want to i want to jump back to verse 48. this is verse 47 and when even was come the ship was in the midst of the sea and he alone on the land now listen friends that's miles and miles and miles away they were in the middle of the sea and he was still on the mountain in the land next verse and he saw them toiling in the rowing this was not with natural eyes he couldn't have seen them in the middle of the sea he was watching them the whole time they thought that he put them in the boat and left and didn't know what was happening in the boat but he was watching the whole time and he was watching them toiling and rowing he knew exactly the predicament they were in his eye was on them he knew where they were and he knew what situation he was in and he knew what he would do about it and in the middle of the storm when everything was contrary and it looked like all would be lost and they were afraid he come walking he coming away nobody expected him to come any coming away nobody else could come listen that's the way he always comes he comes in a way nobody expected him to come and he comes in a way nobody else could come but sometimes when we begin to see the solution that god has we begin to be afraid because it's so unusual and so out of the ordinary he's got to say hey be of good courage it is i be not afraid i'm in control of the storm i'm showing up on the scene i'm pro-coming to deliver you it is i be of good cheer it is i be not afraid and he went it went up into them into the ship and the wind ceased and they were sore amazing themselves beyond measure and wondered for they considered not the miracle of the loaves for their heart was hardened that word hardened means to cover with a thick skin to harden by covering with a callus metaphorically to make the heart dull to grow hard callous become dull lose the power of understanding immediately they kind he shows up and he steps into the boat and calms the waters everything calms the trial's over and they were what they wandered with great amazement because they forgot the loaves and the fish they forgot the loaves and the fish and their heart was hardener dull of understanding calloused over what do loaves and fish have to do with the storm on the sea everything the one who can create more loaves and fish by breaking it is the one who can calm the sea and the one who healed you of flu one who delivered you and gave you a job when it didn't look like you'd get the job and the one who saved you in the car accident looked like you were you were definitely going to wreck and somehow you didn't don't forget the loaves and fish friends this is not the hour to forget the loaves and fish the one who healed your baby when you prayed for them the one who gave you a spouse when you prayed the one who's done everything don't let your heart be hardened and dull of understanding amen the one who can heal a flu can heal every disease and virus amen the one who can deliver financial trouble can deliver from any trouble don't forget the loaves and fish this is the time to remind one another gather your family around in the family altar and start to share your testimony with your children refresh the loaves and fresh remind yourself that he delivered us when we didn't know how we would be delivered he provided when there was no provision he did something in a way we never expected amen he come and showed up in a way we never dreamed they were troubled and they were amazed but they shouldn't have been they forgot the loaves and the fish who told you to get in the boat the same one that's watching you toil and knows the winds are contrary and he's the one who can show up on the scene when nobody else can get to you nobody else they were in the midst of the sea nobody else could get to them but the one who puts you in the boat is the one that's been watching he's the same one who can get to you and nobody else can get to you but don't be amazed or afraid when he shows up watch for him be expecting him to come in an unexpected way expect him to walk on the water and if he bid you come you walk on the water start watching for the miraculous start watching for the amazing why because he's already done the loaves and the fish he's already delivered us he's already healed us how many of you can say he's the lord that healeth all your diseases then what are we afraid of i mean how many can say that he's delivered you when there seemed to be no way of deliverance and he's provided when you saw no provision then what in the world do we have afraid of don't let our hearts be hardened in this hour amen he put us in the boat the winds are beginning to blow friends and they're going to get a whole lot worse than this but he's watching you toil in the ship you're in the boat he puts you in you're toiling and you're laboring amen just have faith that at the right time he's going to show up in an unexpected way and he's going to get to you when nobody else can get to you how do you know because he's already done the lows and the fish this isn't the hour to have a hard heart this isn't the hour to be afraid and to be amazed at all the trouble this is the hour to have faith friends and have an expectation that he's going to come walking on the water just when it looks like all is lost he shows up and when he shows up the contrary winds are over the toiling in the boat is over in one gospel account it says when he stepped in the boat they found themselves on the other side at some point at some point we're going to see him and recognize that he's stepping in the boat and we're suddenly on the other side and it'll all be over and he's going to come in an unexpected way he's going to come when nobody else can come i'm telling you friends in the final hours of our journey on this life he's going to come when nobody else can come and he's going to come in a way nobody else can come and that's the hour we got to remember the loaves and the fish if he's ever delivered you he can always deliver you if he's ever healed you he can always heal you don't be afraid don't let your heart be hardened amen remember the loaves and the fish tell one another about the loaves and the fish tell about your deliverance tell about your healing remind yourself of it write it down in the journal talk to your friends about it don't let your heart get hardened now because things are going to get worse but if he can break fish he can calm the storm and he can step in the boat and we can arrive and somehow find ourselves on the other side how did you get through that trial brother chad i don't know something unexpected happened in an unexpected way he came on the scene and i just found myself on the other side how did it happen there's no reasonable explanation for what happened god delivered me oh praise god friends this is the hour to have confidence in god don't forget the loaves of fish follow the pillar of fire because if the pillar fire leads you there he's got to provide for you there if he leads you to a trap he's got to get you through the trap if he leads you into trouble he's got to get you out of trouble just stay connected to the pillar of fire this holy ghost ministry that's placing us and leading us to take our land and then stick with it wherever he places you is where he'll provide for you wherever he places you is where he'll work with you don't lose confidence now and don't let your heart be hardened man let's all stand praise be to god musicians if you could come brother ben if you'd make your way up tell your friends i'm excited things are getting harder out there more difficult more uncertain i think you would agree things are getting more uncertain but something inside is becoming more certain than ever whatever is going on in the world is the opposite of what's happening inside of me the world's falling apart and i feel like something in me is coming together everybody's terrified that they have no protection from invisible forces but somehow i feel like i'm so protected god he's trained us friends we've watched we've watched the penalty for error we've suffered through the penalties for air ourselves so that we could learn how to just stand on his word and just take him out his word and just believe him stick with the holy ghost if the holy ghost leads you the holy ghost will take care of you all the way and if he led you into a trap then be happy you're in a trap if he led you to a job and all of a sudden it looks like that's the worst job ever at this time praise god you're in the right job if he led you to make a financial decision that now when everything is going in chaos and it looks like the worst financial decision you can make at a time like this praise god if he led you there then he'll take care of you there and you're going to watch something supernatural take place be confident in god be confident in your sonship with god don't let the circumstances in a carnal life cause us to back up when when if you ever said god led you to do something you better stick with it to the bitter end [Music] because one thing that frustrates me is when somebody feels led to do one thing one day and something totally different the next day don't make my god that fickle if god led you to do something stick with it to the bitter end when everything falls apart stick with it because if you're confident he led you here you're going to watch something supernatural take place and i wonder how many times we've bailed on god when he was just about to show up walking on the water because we looked with natural eyes at natural circumstances and did not know that there was a path in the water or there was a path on top of the water but either way god's got a path to get to me and deliver me out of this if you say god let me hear stick with it and tell you know for sure he's led you somewhere else but don't jump because it gets uncomfortable don't bail on your confession just because it gets a little scratchy [Applause] it's not the time to be wishy-washy about the leadership of god now it's time to be certain of the leadership of god and if you're willing to say god led me here then be willing to stick that out until you see god come walking on the water or god will supernaturally reveal to you another plan but don't let's not use our own minds and let's not be fickle about the leadership of the holy ghost but let's be certain of god and if you're not certain god led you don't say he led you just say i think this is the best approach because when you say i think this is the best approach nobody will blame you for thinking something different don't say god led me unless you know god led you because you hinder your own faith backing up on that but just say i feel like this is the right choice to make and i feel like this is what god wants me to do and then later when you change you say well i think i was wrong and every one of us will say praise god brother i've done that a thousand times but when you're certain you can say god i know god led me here then that's the place to stay we don't want to start becoming our own shepherds sometimes he leads you into the valley of the shadow of death but he'll not forsake you for i know thou art with me be sure of god sometimes we've got to reign ourselves in and force ourselves to stick with our confession and it may get pretty uncomfortable and you may have all kinds of doubts in your mind but sometimes you've got to go back to where you were when god led you to make that decision and i did it with all the understanding i had at that day and i was sure god told me to do that and you've got to remind yourself of that because all the circumstances will change and you're going to have to hold fast to see him come walking on the water this is not time for us to be children to toss out words with no meaning but it's time for us to mean what we say and say what we mean and stick with with what we say and if you're confident god led you and he did you stand fast because something supernatural take place and you're gonna have a testimony of how great god is don't forget the loaves and the fish friends let's just pray lord jesus we thank you father for all that you have done for us lord in this hour lord that we live it seems like there's nothing natural that is certain anymore things that seem so certain are falling apart seems like things that you used to be able to put confidence in you can't put confidence in anymore but lord there's one thing that's never changed that's your word [Music] lord you are the same yesterday today and forever and god we want as a body to remember the loaves and the fishes and we want to have the strength to stand firm in the face of all opposition knowing that you've placed us here in this hour and you've ordained us to be here in this time and in this boat and that you're going to show up and make a deliverance oh god i pray that you bless your children lord forgive us for our childishness forgive us for vain words lord forgive us for invoking your name and invoking your word invoking your will when it wasn't lord it was just our own ideas forgive us for that we repent for that lord but help us lord to be careful with our words and say what we really know to be true and believe and help us to stick with our confession until you bring us through god we're sorry for our immaturity we pray god you'd forgive us help us to grow up lord for we know that you want a mature bride in this hour you're not coming for a little girl but you're coming for a fully grown bride coming to full maturity in the full stature of the word and we're asking lord that you would forgive us for our frailty and our carnality lord and give us the strength to stand on your word and grow spiritually to that place you want us to be help us to forsake everything we've known to be true naturally to to receive everything we know to be true spiritually god i prayed you'll go with us and keep us that you would protect us put your hand of protection upon each one of your children lord i pray you would protect and watch over your children just for honoring your word just for having the confidence to honor your word and to gather together and worship i pray that you would honor them because they've honored you that you would protect them and keep them safe in this chaotic world lord we thank you for the privilege of the lord that you've given us to be together to hear your word preach to worship together and feast on your manna help us never to forsake it lord but always to enjoy it to hold it very precious and dear to our hearts bless each each man each woman each father each mother each family lord each one as we have this time lord to build back the family altar lord in our own time of communion with you and devotion help us not waste these times but others that take advantage of them to grow stronger lord to check the foundation to make sure it's sure and to share lord the testimonies with our children and with our families with our friends we love you god we thank you that you've called us to stand in this hour we thank you lord that you've led us by your great pillar of fire to this place and god we can't take care of ourselves we can't even know what to do next we can't even know what's going to happen next lord we are weak and we are helpless little lambs but god we're confident we're under your care we are sure that your eye is watching over us and we are confident you put us in this boat and so god i pray that you'd help us to rest on the inside though contrary winds blow give us that peace that passes understanding knowing that you're watching over us and then when the hour is needed you'll come walking on the water we give you our lives and our full confidence we place in you help us to stand when nothing else can stand help us to stand on your word lord we love you we ask that you would take us from here safely to our homes should watch over for us and preserve for us this privilege to gather together and worship in your name we love your father and we give you preeminence in our lives in jesus christ's name we pray amen i bless you
