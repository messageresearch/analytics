[28:46] touched so we appreciate that and we'd

[33:07] flight like a mighty e
[33:12] go when the hills of
[33:17] Home start calling
[33:22] me when the hills of home
[33:27] start calling
[33:32] [Music]
[33:43] me I'm sure most of you know that it's
[33:45] been a tumultuous
[33:47] Journey uh for the family over the
[33:52] past year two months especially the last
[33:56] week or so was
[33:58] really um intense so um my wife and I we
[34:04] live 2 hours away from here so we would
[34:06] come up and spend several days try to
[34:08] help uh Sam with Jan and the family as
[34:11] they took care of her and uh just a
[34:14] constant uh state of care and need so my
[34:18] job was toh keep the children out from
[34:19] underfoot and I enjoyed that and so we
[34:23] were on the Monday that she passed uh
[34:25] the kids and I were staying at Paul and
[34:27] Alicia's House house so uh we had to
[34:29] drop some milk off for the family so we
[34:32] swung by the house at
[34:33] 10:00 and I told the kids says Grandma's
[34:36] not doing so well so you'll need to stay
[34:37] in the garage they said well we just
[34:39] want to stay in the car I said okay so I
[34:41] just turned the car off and ran in and
[34:43] just as I stepped in the house uh Jan
[34:45] was taking her last
[34:47] breaths and so I stood in there with the
[34:50] family that was gathered around and U as
[34:53] she uh took her final breath uh Amy said
[34:59] I'm not supposed to be getting emotional
[35:01] here Amy said something just uh almost
[35:03] under her breath said uh precious in
[35:05] your sight Lord she was uh quoting
[35:08] Psalms 116 where it says precious
[35:10] precious in the sight of the Lord is the
[35:12] death of his Saints and this seems like
[35:14] a strange
[35:15] verse but uh seems like just something
[35:18] clicked in me and I caught what that
[35:22] meant and I know it would not have been
[35:24] appropriate at that time to give a fist
[35:25] pump and a and a big uh yell Victory out
[35:29] but that's how I felt inside
[35:32] and got a little bit teer eyed and so I
[35:35] thought I'd just share that thought with
[35:37] you also in
[35:39] Ecclesiastes 7:1 it says uh says the day
[35:45] of one's death is better than the day of
[35:47] their birth and that's a rough
[35:49] interpretation there and in verse 8 says
[35:51] better is the end of a thing than the
[35:54] beginning and we don't understand that
[35:56] from the human perspective we uh but if
[35:58] we're Christians and we think this is
[36:00] God's word we've got to say Amen to it
[36:02] and we can say Lord I don't understand
[36:04] that it doesn't make sense because we
[36:06] look out on those poster boards we see
[36:08] the picture of Jan when she was just a
[36:10] baby brought home and some of you some
[36:12] of the family was there when that little
[36:14] lump of love and joy was was brought
[36:16] home we'd much rather be there than
[36:19] where we're at today but God's word says
[36:22] that this is a better day than that and
[36:25] to help us understand that I thank the
[36:26] Lord just give me a little Insight on
[36:28] that and you know as humans when we
[36:32] begin a project of whatever size it
[36:36] starts as a uh it's conceived in our
[36:38] mind and let's say if it's building a
[36:40] house and maybe we sit down at a
[36:43] restaurant and we scribble something out
[36:45] on the back of a napkin we show that to
[36:48] our spouse or whoever's involved in the
[36:50] project and then that project that
[36:52] conception has been taken back to the
[36:54] kitchen table and and we get the ruler
[36:56] and we we try to get our Our rough
[37:00] thought put down a little bit better and
[37:02] we go over it and finally Architects are
[37:04] got get involved and blueprints are
[37:05] drawn up and permits are are uh Acquired
[37:09] and contractors are lined up and every
[37:12] all this groundwork goes on and then we
[37:15] have a ceremony and family is invited
[37:18] and friends and we have a a
[37:19] groundbreaking ceremony and a shovel is
[37:22] shoved into the sod and turned over in a
[37:25] ceremony blueprints are displayed
[37:27] cookies and milk are passed around and
[37:29] there's a big celebration at the
[37:31] potential that we've got and people are
[37:33] trying to catch the vision they don't
[37:34] quite see it maybe we don't understand
[37:36] how this bare piece of ground here is
[37:38] going to turn out to look like what
[37:40] you've got in your mind but the master
[37:42] architect has got something in his mind
[37:45] and so as the family
[37:46] disperses and the excavators and the big
[37:49] equipment come in the concrete trucks
[37:53] the Saws and the Hammers the dust and
[37:55] the dirt and the mud and uh the work
[37:59] goes on working on that Vision that the
[38:01] master had in mind and uh there's
[38:04] disappoints disappointments along the
[38:06] way and setbacks and the weather and
[38:09] ordered material that never arrives and
[38:11] material that comes that's not the right
[38:13] color and and you know how these things
[38:15] are and and uh there's delays and
[38:18] discouragements along the road but
[38:20] finally the day of completion comes all
[38:23] the equipment's gone no more cement
[38:25] trucks no more big noise Vehicles no
[38:28] more saw dust and mud all those family
[38:31] and friends are invited back for an open
[38:33] house contractors neighbors so the the
[38:38] the end of this project is bigger than
[38:40] the beginning more people were involved
[38:42] and touched throughout the process and
[38:44] they come together for a celebration of
[38:47] the vision that the master architect had
[38:50] in mind and there's a ribbon cutting
[38:53] ceremony and again cookies and milk are
[38:56] passed around and people walk through
[38:57] the the house and now they can see the
[38:59] vision that the master architect
[39:01] had and that's what I think God had in
[39:05] mind and when Jan took her last
[39:08] breath it was like that was the ribbon
[39:11] cutting he was done he was
[39:14] satisfied all along the road you know
[39:18] those big trucks and stuff and digging
[39:20] the hole and pouring the concrete that
[39:23] was not the vision the goal of the
[39:25] architect but he wanted a dwelling
[39:30] place and Jan when she came home from
[39:33] the hospital as just as a child that was
[39:36] not the goal that the master had had in
[39:38] mind when she graduated from high school
[39:40] and nursing school that wasn't the goal
[39:42] he had in mind as a mother as a
[39:44] grandmother as a great-grandmother that
[39:46] was not the goal he had in mind but he
[39:48] kept working on it till he got it
[39:50] completed a feeble 75-year-old bedridden
[39:55] woman was not what he had in mind but a
[39:58] Dwelling
[39:59] Place he's working on the spirit and
[40:02] when he got it finished he took it
[40:04] home and I just rejoiced then and I want
[40:07] to Rejoice now we miss the process and
[40:10] like my six-year-old son he would rather
[40:13] have all the excavators running day and
[40:14] night for the rest of his life but
[40:16] that's not the ma that's not the
[40:18] Master's plan he had a goal in mind and
[40:20] he achieved it and I rejoice in that
[40:23] thank you

[52:13] twice on Sundays she read the Bible to
[52:15] us and prayed with us every day rather
[52:18] than just telling me how to be a good
[52:19] person she modeled it for me my mom was
[52:22] not just an ordinary parent she was
[52:24] truly special to me she's my best friend
[52:26] friend confident Confidant uh she she
[52:29] was my role model she will always know
[52:32] she always knew how to make me feel
[52:33] better and was always there for me no
[52:35] matter what her love and support were
[52:37] unwavering and I will always be grateful
[52:40] for the amazing impact she had on my
[52:41] life I'm truly blessed to have such a
[52:43] special
[52:44] mom and then Amy uh wanted to add into
[52:47] here too um some time ago I asked Mom in
[52:51] her life what what brought her the joy
[52:54] and without hesitation her answer was
[52:55] motherhood
[52:57] she loved the years that she and Dad
[52:59] spent rearing as children I knew there
[53:01] had been good times and there were hard
[53:02] times in those years but no matter what
[53:04] was going on she she always faced that
[53:07] that sorry no matter what was going on
[53:10] what adver ad adversity she faced mom
[53:13] always put her needs above our needs
[53:15] above her own as always good Mothers do
[53:18] it was it wasn't just a physical needs
[53:20] that she took care of but she also
[53:21] nurtured us spiritually she prayed with
[53:24] us and read the Bible to us every
[53:25] morning before school even when we were
[53:27] running late teaching us the importance
[53:28] of a daily walk with the Lord mom's care
[53:31] for us the lessons she taught us her
[53:33] examples of perseverance and her
[53:34] constant love for us are the best Legacy
[53:36] she could have left with us and I'm so
[53:38] thankful for
[53:42] it
[53:43] and Mom was the uh everybody here knows
[53:48] it but the Wallflower in the room she
[53:50] was always the quiet lady that would sit
[53:52] with a smile and uh if you're watching
[53:55] the slideshow here you saw that almost
[53:57] every picture she was in a brown chair
[53:58] sitting in the corner and that was that
[54:00] was mom's place and we would come in and
[54:02] say hello to her and and uh give her a
[54:05] kiss on the forehead and we carry on our
[54:06] conversation she would sit there and
[54:08] listen to everything that was going on
[54:09] she would know my doctor's appointment
[54:11] she would know when I had to where we
[54:13] were going to go on vacation when it was
[54:15] going to be and I didn't think she would
[54:16] even know I'd come back in she goes
[54:17] isn't the 7eventh you're supposed to be
[54:19] going the yep that's exactly right in
[54:21] the middle of everything that was going
[54:22] on with her she would still remember
[54:23] those things but she was always always
[54:27] we were the center of her life and she
[54:28] did everything to just to just to pull
[54:31] us into
[54:32] to together as a family and that's a
[54:34] place for us it's going to be really
[54:36] hard um to have that that empty chair
[54:39] there at the house and and uh we're
[54:41] going to we're going to heal and and
[54:42] it's going to be good God's going to
[54:44] give us peace but you know right now
[54:45] it's just a little bit tough but um I
[54:48] did get a text from Bill herburger and
[54:50] uh this kind of when I was thinking
[54:52] about Mom just being that quiet Rock
[54:54] sitting there with a smile Bill text
[54:56] this this morning or last night I guess
[54:58] it was but he said I will never forget
[55:00] the times we spent with your parents at
[55:01] their house when I was a young Christian
[55:03] Aunt Jam was an encouragement to me as a
[55:05] young believer in Christ she was always
[55:07] so kind and pleasant to be around that
[55:09] type of Christlike character that's
[55:11] vitally important for new Believers and
[55:12] I thank the Lord for her life God bless
[55:15] you and give you strength and courage
[55:16] but that was exactly that was what I was
[55:19] just thinking on Mom that was just that
[55:20] that encouragement she always had it was
[55:22] quiet encouragement but she was able to
[55:23] just to just a smile and and and when
[55:26] you need need it she was there um when
[55:29] she was going through the last about 6
[55:30] months it was kind of tough for her and
[55:32] uh I would remind her she would always
[55:34] felt like she was putting us out when we
[55:35] come over late at night to help her get
[55:36] to bed and she uh she really felt bad
[55:41] that it was uh causing us some grief but
[55:44] I would tell her uh one of the best
[55:46] memories I have was on the playground
[55:47] there at Columbus Grove School and I was
[55:49] hanging upside down on the monkey bars
[55:51] and I slipped fell off and landed in the
[55:53] gravel on my forehead got a bunch of
[55:55] stones in the forehead no
[55:58] joke they got a few left but they were
[56:00] digging those out and the doctor was
[56:02] trying to get me down I remember looking
[56:03] up mom had to come in and grab my
[56:05] shoulders and hold me down I remember
[56:07] looking up and he had a light that
[56:09] shining down I can see Mom and her eyes
[56:12] uh started getting tearing up and
[56:13] remember big tear drop on my cheek and U
[56:17] when I saw that I hated to see her cry
[56:18] and uh and uh so I was able to to guess
[56:24] man up and and take it after that but I
[56:25] was telling when we were trying to help
[56:27] her in the St stah study and move her
[56:29] around and things about how much it was
[56:31] a problem for us mom I that story
[56:33] remember that you were holding me down
[56:35] as much as you hated to do it but always
[56:36] taking care of us you know all those
[56:38] years and and here we get a chance and
[56:40] opportunity to be able to to return just
[56:41] a little bit of that to her it was it
[56:43] was a blessing for us who hated to see
[56:45] her go through it but to be able to help
[56:47] like that but uh and speaking of that
[56:49] Dad I want to say the absolute best
[56:52] caregiver I mean the last
[56:57] the last four or five
[57:00] years yeah he's been that's been his
[57:02] full time you know helping Mom and no I
[57:05] mean it was all of love not a duty not a
[57:07] sense of Duty but he helped her
[57:09] everything everywhere they went just I
[57:12] could talk on that but I said no this No
[57:14] No
[57:15] Cry it was good dad I love you just
[57:18] can't say enough
[57:21] that yeah that was good I will jump onto
[57:25] this right here lilacs you know Uncle
[57:27] Mike he did a super job right here this
[57:30] is just the embodiment here I mean
[57:31] seeing these flowers here mom's lilacs
[57:33] she was big lover lilacs the purple and
[57:36] Uncle Mike and Barb you guys stayed late
[57:39] there at Town and Country after the
[57:40] hours and it was closed and did such a
[57:42] marvelous job here but those lilacs
[57:45] meant a lot to Mom every house we went
[57:46] we always had a lilac bush and this last
[57:48] one we just put one in the back of the
[57:49] house for her and uh she loved the
[57:51] spring lilacs but it was unusual this
[57:54] year we were able to have a fall uh uh
[57:57] Bloom here on the lilacs and so Alicia
[58:00] you brought some over to Mom there just
[58:01] a few days before things really did a
[58:03] downturn but she she was able to respond
[58:05] able to hold that that BL that bloom
[58:07] there and smell it tell her tell you how
[58:09] much she loved it but uh Becky found a
[58:12] little article here but it says about
[58:14] why lilacs bloom again but it says
[58:17] um stressful growing conditions
[58:20] typically are the reason for an untimely
[58:21] Bloom occasionally lilacs will Bloom out
[58:24] of season during the fall months this
[58:26] out of season
[58:28] Bloom it's usually triggered by
[58:30] stressful environment conditions during
[58:32] the summer growing season hotter than
[58:34] normal temperatures drought conditions
[58:36] are large contributors to the phenomenon
[58:38] these spring blooming plants set their
[58:40] flower buds for the following year in
[58:42] early summer shortly before after the
[58:44] previous spring sorry spring blooms fade
[58:48] help me out
[58:52] here these spring blooming plants set
[58:54] their flower buds for the following year
[58:56] in early summer shortly after the
[58:57] previous spring blooms fade stressful
[59:00] conditions are the plant stressful
[59:03] conditions put the plant in a dormant
[59:04] likee State and when the cooler
[59:05] temperatures and shorter days of fall
[59:07] arrive some of the flower buds are
[59:08] triggered to bloom but I was just
[59:10] thinking that here the last about 6
[59:11] months you know it's been extremely
[59:13] stressful for Mom but you know even in
[59:15] the stressful times and even in the last
[59:17] 6 months she's still growing you know
[59:18] and and uh and then we finally here on
[59:20] her birthday here back on the 25th she
[59:23] was able to to bloom again so that was
[59:25] wonderful but and I'm going to right
[59:28] here um just finishing up we've had all
[59:32] the family different ones that take
[59:34] part I'd like to get the grand great
[59:36] grand baby to come up Caleb could you

[1:01:39] just love those good putham County
[1:01:41] Farmers you guys are wonderful
[1:01:43] appreciate you
[1:01:54] coming oh amen that was
[1:01:57] wonderful say God bless you all it's
[1:01:59] good to see you all out here and we're
[1:02:02] counted a privilege to be able to gather
[1:02:04] here like this to reflect and remember
[1:02:06] our sister Jan and uh each one of us are
[1:02:09] here had some part in some way we
[1:02:11] touched by her life had interaction with
[1:02:13] her some more than others some for
[1:02:15] longer than others but each one of us
[1:02:17] are here because we were in contact with
[1:02:19] a life and that life had an impact on
[1:02:22] each one of us I really appreciate the
[1:02:24] remarks from the family there and uh it
[1:02:27] was encouraging to me because it's so in
[1:02:29] line with the things that were on my
[1:02:30] heart to just share with you as we look
[1:02:32] to the word of God and reflect on what a
[1:02:35] life lived is all about um as brother
[1:02:39] Ron said uh right there in the beginning
[1:02:42] of the comments that he made he said
[1:02:43] precious in the sight of the Lord is the
[1:02:45] death of his Saints and precious means
[1:02:48] with great value or great weight are of
[1:02:50] great importance and for God it's it's
[1:02:53] something that's of Great Value and
[1:02:55] important to him amen and God doesn't
[1:02:58] mourn it the way we do for him he sees
[1:03:01] it as a graduation and for her for our
[1:03:04] sister Jan it was quite that way a
[1:03:06] graduation I'd like to read a scripture
[1:03:08] out of Philippians chapter
[1:03:10] 1 and uh verse 21 and this is from the
[1:03:14] Apostle Paul he says for to me for for
[1:03:18] to me to live as Christ and to die is
[1:03:23] gain the Apostle Paul was struggling
[1:03:25] with whether or not he should continue
[1:03:27] on in Life or go on to his reward and
[1:03:31] and he makes this following statement uh
[1:03:34] down in verse 23 he says for I in a
[1:03:36] straight betwix two having a desire to
[1:03:39] depart and to be with Christ Which is
[1:03:42] far better I love that phrase far better
[1:03:46] he said for I'm in a straight between
[1:03:49] two what what's the straight whether to
[1:03:51] stay and help you all or whether to go
[1:03:53] on but he acknowledged uh that uh but I
[1:03:58] have a desire to depart and be with
[1:03:59] Christ Which is far better nevertheless
[1:04:02] to abide in the flesh is more needful
[1:04:05] for you so that was Paul's struggle
[1:04:08] Paul's struggle was not whether to have
[1:04:09] this life or to have the next he knew
[1:04:11] exactly what he wanted he wanted to go
[1:04:13] on his struggle was either to remain and
[1:04:16] help you or to go on and I say our
[1:04:19] sister Jan I'm sure had the same
[1:04:20] struggle whether to stay with her family
[1:04:22] and be a mother and a grandmother and a
[1:04:24] wife or to go on but I'd say she would
[1:04:27] confess the same thing Paul confessed to
[1:04:29] be with Christ is far better and I'd say
[1:04:31] for sure that'd be your testimony if you
[1:04:33] could ask her now it's far better amen
[1:04:36] and for us we're happy for her we're
[1:04:37] thankful that she was able to move on to
[1:04:40] her reward and to her blessing once
[1:04:42] again and though she would have liked to
[1:04:44] have stayed and been a help to her
[1:04:47] family and to the Saints and to everyone
[1:04:49] else whom she loved I believe her work
[1:04:52] was done that she had done what God
[1:04:54] intended for her to do
[1:04:56] and she was rewarded at the end for her
[1:04:59] for her
[1:05:00] faithfulness second Timothy 4 the
[1:05:02] Apostle Paul writes in verse 6 for I am
[1:05:05] now ready to be offered and the time of
[1:05:07] my departure is at hand I have fought a
[1:05:10] good fight I have finished my course I
[1:05:13] have kept the faith henceforth there is
[1:05:14] laid up for me a crown of righteousness
[1:05:16] which the Lord the righteous judge shall
[1:05:18] give me at that day and not to me only
[1:05:21] but unto all them also that love is
[1:05:24] appearing things Paul says I have
[1:05:27] finished my course and he say I have
[1:05:30] finished the course but I finished my
[1:05:32] course that course is a type of race but
[1:05:35] not a race is in a Sprint but like in a
[1:05:37] marathon a long race a long race that
[1:05:40] takes endurance and takes patience and
[1:05:42] takes time to complete and Paul knew
[1:05:45] that he had come to the end of of what
[1:05:48] God had given him to do he'd come to the
[1:05:50] end of his course and I believe we each
[1:05:53] have a course each of the children of
[1:05:54] God have a course a race a path in life
[1:05:57] that we must run and he in doing so he
[1:06:00] had kept the faith and he knew that
[1:06:02] there was a crown of righteous is laid
[1:06:04] up for him I thought it was amazing as
[1:06:07] we we began to realize that the day of
[1:06:10] sister Jan's birth also became the date
[1:06:13] of her departure I thought that was
[1:06:15] extra special gift that God gave to her
[1:06:17] and to the family she came into the
[1:06:20] world and she left the world on the same
[1:06:22] date 75 years apart because she had a
[1:06:25] course and that course was mapped out by
[1:06:27] God and God knew the day that that
[1:06:28] course would begin and he knew that the
[1:06:30] day that that would end and I I believe
[1:06:34] that sister Jen kept the faith I believe
[1:06:36] she fought a good fight and she ran her
[1:06:39] course and she kept the
[1:06:42] faith as I was thinking about our sister
[1:06:45] and looking into the word I I came
[1:06:47] across this thought that that really
[1:06:49] began to move me out of Matthew chapter
[1:06:52] 9:9 we all know really well that Jesus
[1:06:56] called his disciples to himself but it
[1:06:58] says in Matthew 9:9 and as Jesus passed
[1:07:00] forth from then he saw a man named
[1:07:03] Matthew sitting at the receipt of
[1:07:04] customs and he said unto him follow me
[1:07:07] and he arose and he followed him we find
[1:07:10] this language many times in the gospel
[1:07:12] as he comes to different disciples again
[1:07:14] in John 1:43 he says the day following
[1:07:17] Jesus would go forth into Galilee and
[1:07:19] findeth Phillip and saith unto him
[1:07:21] follow me and it's amazing how Jesus was
[1:07:25] commanding them not to go somewhere not
[1:07:27] to do something he gave them one command
[1:07:30] and that command was follow me he wanted
[1:07:32] them to follow him and and when I
[1:07:35] reflect on what does it mean to follow
[1:07:37] Jesus and how would sister Jan follow
[1:07:40] Jesus and how would we follow Jesus we
[1:07:42] must realize that that these men what
[1:07:45] they saw is they saw a man in flesh they
[1:07:47] saw another human being and they could
[1:07:49] actually follow him and keep their eyes
[1:07:51] on the back of his head and go where he
[1:07:53] went but we know that Jesus is the word
[1:07:55] that was made flesh and to follow Jesus
[1:07:58] today as Jan did in her life would be to
[1:08:01] follow Jesus Christ the revealed word to
[1:08:04] follow the word of God because God is
[1:08:06] his word and the Word was made flesh and
[1:08:09] I believe that's what sister Jan did I
[1:08:10] believe she followed Jesus she followed
[1:08:14] him amen we
[1:08:16] know that just the statement follow me
[1:08:20] is a big statement because when he says
[1:08:22] follow me it shows that Jesus was an
[1:08:25] intent on being stationary he wasn't
[1:08:28] planning on being in a fixed position to
[1:08:31] be stationary and and constant and
[1:08:34] unmoving but God Jesus Christ God in
[1:08:37] flesh the word made flesh was on the
[1:08:39] move and because he was on the move he
[1:08:42] had to give this commandment don't stay
[1:08:44] here and don't stay there but follow me
[1:08:47] because if you want to stay where I am
[1:08:48] I'm moving and you have to follow me and
[1:08:50] we know that this word has been moving
[1:08:52] through generations through time as God
[1:08:54] unfolds himself himself and the children
[1:08:56] of God are getting the same command
[1:08:58] follow me Amen in in
[1:09:02] Matthew uh 16 verse 20 24 and verse 25
[1:09:08] says then said Jesus unto his disciples
[1:09:10] If any man will come after me let him
[1:09:12] deny himself and take up his cross and
[1:09:15] follow me for whosoever will save his
[1:09:18] life shall lose it and whosoever will
[1:09:20] lose his life for my sake shall find it
[1:09:23] so here in another commandment from
[1:09:25] Jesus the disciples we find the message
[1:09:27] of Follow Me Goes a little deeper
[1:09:29] because in order to follow him if any
[1:09:31] man will come after me let him deny
[1:09:34] himself and take up his cross and follow
[1:09:37] me so to follow the lord doesn't is not
[1:09:40] a simple statement of I'll just walk the
[1:09:42] way Jesus walks and I'll follow him but
[1:09:44] there must be a self-denial attached to
[1:09:47] it and there must be a self- crucifixion
[1:09:49] there must be a death to self because we
[1:09:51] have to die many times to the way we
[1:09:53] view the world or the way we think
[1:09:56] should things should be or the way that
[1:09:57] we have taught things are and in order
[1:10:00] to follow him there must be a death to
[1:10:03] self and and then you can take up your
[1:10:07] cross and follow me for if we will save
[1:10:09] our life we'll lose it but if we'll lose
[1:10:11] our life we shall find
[1:10:14] it this is what our sister Jen was able
[1:10:18] to do this is the example that she left
[1:10:21] for all of us she was able to follow the
[1:10:24] lord in Romans 6:3 Paul says you know
[1:10:28] you not that so many of us as we
[1:10:29] baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized
[1:10:32] into his death therefore we were buried
[1:10:34] with him by baptism into death that like
[1:10:37] as Christ was raised up from the dead by
[1:10:38] the glory of the father even so we also
[1:10:40] should walk in newness of life for if we
[1:10:44] have been planted together in the
[1:10:45] likeness of his death we shall be also
[1:10:47] in the likeness of his resurrection
[1:10:49] knowing this that our old man is
[1:10:51] crucified with him that the body of sin
[1:10:54] might be destroyed that henceforth we
[1:10:56] should not serve sin so but Paul's
[1:11:00] saying when we were baptized into Christ
[1:11:02] we were baptized unto our death we died
[1:11:04] we died so that we can come forth with a
[1:11:07] newness of life our life in Christ Jesus
[1:11:09] as we begin to follow him that self
[1:11:13] crucifixion and Jan made that transition
[1:11:16] she had to move in life from what was
[1:11:18] familiar to her and what she understood
[1:11:21] and what was traditional she had to make
[1:11:23] a move and she had to make a transition
[1:11:25] and and in doing so she had to die to
[1:11:27] self and when she would make that
[1:11:29] transition she would come to the
[1:11:30] revelation of the word for her day and
[1:11:32] she would recognize that the word is
[1:11:34] real the word is true the word is
[1:11:36] present tense and it's asking me to he's
[1:11:38] asking me to follow him and she did that
[1:11:42] and we know according to scripture that
[1:11:44] she was baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:11:46] Jesus Christ literally taking the name
[1:11:48] of Christ on her in baptism and to do
[1:11:51] that was a major death to self and and
[1:11:54] coming forth in newness of life as she
[1:11:57] followed him and sister Jan made that
[1:12:02] transition she died to to many things to
[1:12:07] come to follow
[1:12:09] Christ and in Matthew 4 Jesus says to
[1:12:13] his disciples for those who will follow
[1:12:14] him he says this and Jesus walking by
[1:12:17] the Sea of Galilee saw two brothers
[1:12:19] Simon called Peter and Andrew his
[1:12:21] brother casting a net into the sea for
[1:12:23] they were Fishers and he said unto them
[1:12:26] follow me and I will make you Fishers of
[1:12:28] Men and they straightway left their Nets
[1:12:31] and followed him and going on from then
[1:12:33] he saw other two Brethren uh James the
[1:12:36] son of zebede and John's brother in a
[1:12:38] ship with Zebedee their father mening
[1:12:41] their Nets and he called them and they
[1:12:43] immediately left the ship and their
[1:12:45] father and followed
[1:12:48] him amen this is what it was to deny
[1:12:51] yourself and take up your cross and
[1:12:53] follow they left every everything that
[1:12:55] was familiar to them they left their
[1:12:57] family business they left their father
[1:13:00] they left the Nets they left everything
[1:13:02] that had they had grown to know all of
[1:13:04] their lives they left it to do what to
[1:13:07] follow Jesus but he said I'll make you a
[1:13:10] promise if you follow me I'll make you
[1:13:12] Fishers of Men meaning if you'll follow
[1:13:15] me I'll make you to catch Souls you will
[1:13:18] win those to Christ if you follow me and
[1:13:21] that's the promise for those who will
[1:13:24] follow
[1:13:26] Jesus and we found that to be true for
[1:13:28] sister Jan very true for because she she
[1:13:34] in her family and her household she went
[1:13:36] first she heard the call she heard the
[1:13:39] word she recognized that God Amen had
[1:13:42] brought a further revelation of his word
[1:13:44] in this day and and that was Jesus
[1:13:46] Christ the word that was revealed and
[1:13:48] she heard his call she heard him calling
[1:13:50] for her to follow and she left Nets and
[1:13:53] she she left everything and and she
[1:13:55] followed him but because she followed
[1:13:58] him he says I I'll make you Fishers of
[1:14:01] Men and that's exactly what happened to
[1:14:03] our sister because shortly behind her
[1:14:05] came her
[1:14:06] husband Brother Sam was testifying to me
[1:14:09] and sharing the story again with me the
[1:14:11] other night that that what he saw in his
[1:14:15] wife affected him so much he wanted what
[1:14:19] she had it says in 1 Peter chapter 3
[1:14:23] Peter says likewise you wives in
[1:14:25] subjection to your own husbands that if
[1:14:27] any obey not the word they also May
[1:14:29] without the word be won by the
[1:14:31] conversation that's lifestyle that's the
[1:14:33] life of the wives while they behold your
[1:14:37] chaste conversation that's your holy
[1:14:40] lifestyle coupled with fear that's
[1:14:42] reverence to God and that's what Brother
[1:14:44] Sam told me he saw he saw that in his
[1:14:47] wife he saw the change that had come
[1:14:49] over her he saw her chased conversation
[1:14:52] coupled with her reverence for God and
[1:14:53] had such an impact on on him that Jan
[1:14:56] got what Peter had had promised her and
[1:14:59] what Jesus had said if you follow me
[1:15:00] I'll make you Fishers of Men and her
[1:15:02] husband was caught and it's so amazing
[1:15:05] it wasn't because she preached him
[1:15:07] sermons and it and it wasn't because she
[1:15:09] forced him or she manipulating or made
[1:15:11] him feel bad all she had to do was
[1:15:14] follow Jesus and he said if you follow
[1:15:15] me I'll make you a fisher of men and
[1:15:18] that example had an
[1:15:21] impact
[1:15:22] amen uh the prophet of God says this he
[1:15:26] says listen so many people has got the
[1:15:29] wrong concept to convert people to
[1:15:31] Christianity and to a government is not
[1:15:33] God's thought at all said we made coners
[1:15:36] to Christianity by his government that's
[1:15:37] not it well they're not supposed to
[1:15:39] drink they're not supposed to lie do you
[1:15:41] know that muhammadans can outshine you
[1:15:43] further down he says now notice God
[1:15:45] makes himself known not we're not
[1:15:47] supposed to make converts to
[1:15:48] Christianity by a government but by the
[1:15:51] Revelation the Christ in you as God was
[1:15:54] in Christ Christ as God was in Christ
[1:15:56] Christ in you then what God did in
[1:15:59] Christ Christ does in you what signs did
[1:16:01] God in Christ Christ does in you oh
[1:16:04] isn't that beautiful I mean we're not
[1:16:07] supposed to convert people because we
[1:16:08] bring them to a form or a structure or
[1:16:11] an order or a set of rules or a
[1:16:13] government of the church but what's
[1:16:15] actually supposed to bring people to
[1:16:16] Christ is Christ in us the life that we
[1:16:19] live becomes an attractant the life that
[1:16:21] we live becomes an attractant to the
[1:16:23] people amen and and then it brings them
[1:16:26] into a connection where they can follow
[1:16:27] Christ themselves now it's Christ in US
[1:16:32] becomes the attractant so that Christ
[1:16:34] can be in them and that becomes the
[1:16:36] conversion
[1:16:38] Amen in 2 Corinthians 3 the Apostle Paul
[1:16:41] says you are our Epistles written in our
[1:16:44] hearts known and read of all men for as
[1:16:46] much as ye are manifestly declared to be
[1:16:49] the Epistle of Christ that means you're
[1:16:50] the letter of Christ ministered by US
[1:16:53] Written not with ink but with the Spirit
[1:16:55] of the Living God not in tables of stone
[1:16:58] but in fleshly tables of the heart amen
[1:17:01] that's that's the promise to us that if
[1:17:05] we'll follow after him then we become
[1:17:07] the Epistles of Christ read of all men
[1:17:10] written in our hearts and that was
[1:17:12] sister Jan to us it's amazing how uh
[1:17:16] brother Steve described his mom as the
[1:17:18] Wallflower the one on the side but yet
[1:17:21] without a dominant personality and
[1:17:24] without any force or any gift of
[1:17:26] persuasion without that she was able to
[1:17:29] influence everybody around her what was
[1:17:32] it it was the Christ in her it was the
[1:17:35] light shining through her it was she
[1:17:37] followed Christ and now Christ was using
[1:17:39] her Amen to do what he promised to do to
[1:17:41] make her a fisher of men because it
[1:17:44] wasn't just her husband that she caught
[1:17:46] but it was her children too that
[1:17:49] influence went on beyond beyond her
[1:17:52] husband it went beyond that and it began
[1:17:54] to influence the children that God gave
[1:17:57] her amen and the prophet of God made
[1:18:00] this statement which I absolutely love
[1:18:02] he said everything thinks thinks about
[1:18:05] their mother you know I think mother the
[1:18:07] good true mother is the Fifth Gospel
[1:18:10] Matthew Mark Luke John mother mother
[1:18:13] gets them first that's the one who
[1:18:15] brings them up first is Mother amen and
[1:18:18] that's why my I was so encouraged when I
[1:18:21] heard the things that the family were
[1:18:22] saying about their mother because to
[1:18:24] them she was the Gospel she was a living
[1:18:27] gospel she was the word made manifest in
[1:18:29] her life and they saw it and they knew
[1:18:31] it was real and the reality of life and
[1:18:34] mother amen had great impact on her and
[1:18:37] I say that impact is continuing on not
[1:18:40] just in her children it influence her
[1:18:42] children and their children they saw her
[1:18:44] follow Christ amen they met Christ for
[1:18:47] themselves and then now they're giving
[1:18:48] that example to their children and now
[1:18:50] it's going to another generation we know
[1:18:53] God has no grandchildren each one must
[1:18:55] come to their own experience with Jesus
[1:18:57] Christ themselves and begin to follow
[1:18:59] him but it's the ones who who who who
[1:19:01] gave that example that lead us to Christ
[1:19:04] amen and then we meet him for ourselves
[1:19:06] and then we follow him and leave an
[1:19:07] example for somebody else to meet Christ
[1:19:09] and then they follow him and we see in
[1:19:11] the family that it's happening
[1:19:13] generationally as each generation has
[1:19:15] their own experience with Christ amen
[1:19:18] because that was her promise if you'll
[1:19:20] just follow me don't try to figure it
[1:19:21] out don't try to get smart don't be
[1:19:23] preachy don't just follow me and in
[1:19:27] following him she became the Fifth
[1:19:30] Gospel to her children in fact probably
[1:19:32] the one they read first before they
[1:19:34] could read their Bibles they could read
[1:19:36] the word in mom's life in John
[1:19:40] 15:16 Jesus speaking again to his
[1:19:42] disciples he says you have not chosen me
[1:19:45] but I have chosen you and ordained you
[1:19:48] that you should go and bring forth
[1:19:52] fruit and that your fruit should remain
[1:19:55] and whatsoever you ask the father in my
[1:19:57] name he will give it you those that
[1:20:01] Jesus said to follow he told them I've
[1:20:04] ordained you I've called you you didn't
[1:20:07] find me I found you and I don't believe
[1:20:09] sister Jan found Christ I believe Christ
[1:20:11] found her came her way like he did to
[1:20:14] the disciples one day and says follow me
[1:20:16] and she was able to leave everything and
[1:20:19] follow him but in so doing he said I've
[1:20:21] ordained you and in my ordinance for you
[1:20:24] my ation for you is that you'll bring
[1:20:26] forth
[1:20:28] fruit and that your fruit should remain
[1:20:33] when we think about sister
[1:20:35] Jan the thing that was remarkable what
[1:20:37] the family mentions and what we all
[1:20:39] remember is that she had the simple
[1:20:42] humble Life of Christ not extravagant I
[1:20:45] don't know that she ever preached I
[1:20:48] don't know that she ever stood up and
[1:20:50] gave a testimony not that I ever
[1:20:52] remember I don't know that she was ever
[1:20:54] dying dynamic in that way I don't know
[1:20:56] that she ever was testifying on the
[1:20:57] street I don't know but she was
[1:20:59] following the Lord and she had a
[1:21:01] Ministry and he made her Fishers of Men
[1:21:03] and those fish got caught and many of
[1:21:05] them are sitting right here and others
[1:21:08] who were influenced but he ordained that
[1:21:10] she would bring forth fruit and that
[1:21:13] that fruit should remain that it's not
[1:21:17] going to be lost but it'll be there on
[1:21:18] that day because that was her course
[1:21:21] that was her life that was her Ministry
[1:21:23] that was her work and following the Lord
[1:21:25] and that was her promise that she'll be
[1:21:27] a fisher of men and that she was going
[1:21:29] to bring forth fruit and she brought
[1:21:30] forth fruit and that that fruit shall
[1:21:33] remain because it was God's plan for her
[1:21:38] life it's amazing when you reflect on
[1:21:40] the impact that one life can have an
[1:21:43] eternal impact an everlasting impact not
[1:21:46] something that's trivial or foolish but
[1:21:48] something that can go on for the ages to
[1:21:52] come Jesus he's the one who said follow
[1:21:55] me he he's the one who led the disciples
[1:21:58] and he had fruit and his fruit would
[1:21:59] remain but he said this in a prayer in
[1:22:02] John
[1:22:03] 17 he said father I will that they also
[1:22:07] whom thou Hast given me be with me where
[1:22:10] I am what was jesus' desire that all
[1:22:13] that the father had given him will be
[1:22:15] with him where he is he was getting
[1:22:17] ready to depart the time of his
[1:22:18] departure was near he was leaving the
[1:22:20] Mortal realm and moving in back into the
[1:22:23] immortality and his desire was that all
[1:22:25] that God had given him would be with him
[1:22:28] where he was that they may behold my
[1:22:30] glory which thou has given me for thou
[1:22:32] lovest me before the foundation of the
[1:22:34] world I believe sister Jan's prayer was
[1:22:36] the
[1:22:37] same father of all that you've given me
[1:22:40] the fruit of my Ministry the promise of
[1:22:43] following after you I pray that they be
[1:22:46] with me where I am amen and where is she
[1:22:50] she's beyond the Gate of mortality she's
[1:22:53] beyond the time of journeying in this
[1:22:55] flesh she's moved on to an eternal
[1:22:58] inheritance kept in the heavens she's
[1:23:00] moved on to her theophany body she's in
[1:23:02] a body that cannot get sick she's in a
[1:23:05] body that cannot feel pain she's in a
[1:23:07] body amen that that that cannot suffer
[1:23:10] the way that she was suffering she's
[1:23:12] gone on to a reward and we thank God
[1:23:14] there's been a prophet in this
[1:23:15] generation that's went beyond the
[1:23:16] curtain of time and brought us back the
[1:23:17] report so we know exactly where she is
[1:23:20] and what she's enjoying and the
[1:23:22] blessings that she's walking in but I
[1:23:24] believe her prayer would be that where I
[1:23:26] am they may be
[1:23:29] also in John
[1:23:31] 13 Jesus says this John
[1:23:34] 13:36 Simon Peter said to him Lord
[1:23:37] whether goest
[1:23:39] thou Jesus had told him I have to leave
[1:23:42] I'm leaving and Peter wanted to be where
[1:23:44] he was Peter says no don't leave me he
[1:23:47] said I'm leaving whether goest thou
[1:23:49] Jesus answered him whether I go thou
[1:23:52] cast not follow me now
[1:23:55] but Thou shalt follow me afterwards
[1:23:58] Jesus had told his disciples follow me
[1:24:00] follow me and Peter wants to keep
[1:24:03] following him but there's a course for
[1:24:05] Peter to run there's a or there's a path
[1:24:07] for Peter that's ordained and fruit for
[1:24:09] Peter to bring forth but he says you
[1:24:11] cannot follow me now he didn't say you
[1:24:13] can't follow me he said you can't follow
[1:24:16] me now but in due time you'll follow me
[1:24:19] beyond the Gate of mortality Beyond
[1:24:22] fleshly life you'll move back into the
[1:24:24] Realms of immortality and we believe
[1:24:26] Peter was also able to follow one
[1:24:31] day amen 1 Corinthians 11 this is the
[1:24:34] last verse that I want to leave with you
[1:24:35] 1 Corinthians
[1:24:37] 11:1 be ye followers of me even as I
[1:24:41] also am of
[1:24:44] Christ and I want to say that on behalf
[1:24:47] of sister Jan be followers of
[1:24:51] me even as I also am of Christ
[1:24:55] she heard his call when she said follow
[1:24:58] me she followed she dropped the Nets and
[1:25:00] left the boat and she followed and in so
[1:25:03] doing she became a written epistle that
[1:25:06] others read in her life and were
[1:25:07] influenced to give their lives to Christ
[1:25:10] her family and
[1:25:12] others and there was a time there was a
[1:25:15] place you couldn't follow him yet and
[1:25:16] that was into the realm of immortality
[1:25:18] you can't follow me here now Jan but you
[1:25:20] shall come later well she's followed him
[1:25:24] she's followed him Beyond mortality
[1:25:26] she's followed him into immortality
[1:25:28] she's
[1:25:30] went she was the first in her family to
[1:25:34] follow and she led the way now she's
[1:25:38] first to go through the gate called
[1:25:40] death into
[1:25:42] immortality she's went first the whole
[1:25:44] time Brother Sam she went first
[1:25:48] again but she went first because that's
[1:25:51] where she followed her Lord
[1:25:53] to remember but I know she would want
[1:25:55] all of you to follow to keep following
[1:25:59] her as she followed Christ to keep
[1:26:00] following Christ the word until you too
[1:26:04] can Step Beyond the Gate of mortality
[1:26:06] and immortality for some it'll be by the
[1:26:09] way of the Grave for some it'll be a
[1:26:11] change in the body but let's keep
[1:26:13] following Christ keep following this
[1:26:15] revealed word keep following after him
[1:26:18] amen until we too can follow from this
[1:26:21] life into the next life I would believe
[1:26:24] that would be a parting message for us
[1:26:28] to take away from Sister Jan's life that
[1:26:31] the impact of a life sometimes cannot be
[1:26:33] measured Moment by moment in the times
[1:26:36] that the families were gathering in the
[1:26:38] Simplicity of a meal or a holiday or a
[1:26:41] family function and the Simplicity of
[1:26:43] her just being there and being attentive
[1:26:45] and being encouraging reading a Bible
[1:26:47] verse or reading a scripture or saying
[1:26:49] something from the word and that moment
[1:26:51] by moment you might not be able to
[1:26:52] measure the impact of a life but when
[1:26:54] you stand back and you you gather it all
[1:26:57] up and the impact it had on everybody
[1:26:59] all the scriptures all the encouragement
