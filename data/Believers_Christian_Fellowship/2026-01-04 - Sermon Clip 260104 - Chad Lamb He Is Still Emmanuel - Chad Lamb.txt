TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Smur church age. He says in the Ephesians age and in this age and in every age we contemplate we will see that this is true and in the last age which is our age we will find the blackout of the word the complete apostasy ending in the great tribulation. So brother Bam tells us that when we get to the Leodysian church age there's going to be a complete blackout of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what is light? The word. When it's blacked out, it becomes darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in the last age, there'll be a complete blackout of the word. The complete apostasy ending in the great tribulation. &gt;&gt; That's where Leodysia is heading. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Complete blackout. Brother Brandham even looked in one place. He says, you know, I could see no light past 1977. It was all darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. When he looked into the church, Amen. when he looked into the church in the Leodysian church age, it went into complete apostasy. And God verified this. Amen. At the at the end of uh I think it was the end of 1964. Amen. When he showed, Amen. an eclipse of the moon in the sky and put it in the papers across the nation. There was only six pictures. There wasn't a seven. And he showed that it typed Amen. the same image that he drew on the blackboard when he preached. Amen. The the seven church ages. The same image that was reflected by the pillar of fire on the back wall of BRANDHAM TABERNACLE. BUT NOW WHEN HE COMES TO 1964, HE SHOWS THAT NOW IT'S DIFFERENT. HE SAID, "I SHOWED YOU SEVEN with a little sliver of light. It reflected back on the back wall. But when God showed it in the heavens, there was no SEVENTH PICTURE BECAUSE IT WAS ALL BLACK. Completely black. No more light in the denominations." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I thought Zachchariah said it would be light in the evening time. It is light in the evening time. IT'S THE ABSOLUTE APOSTASY FOR DENOMINATIONAL SYSTEMS. APOSTASY FOR CHURCH SYSTEMS. AMEN. BUT FOR THE TRUE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST, IT IS THE RISING OF THE SUN. IT IS THE DAWN OF A NEW DAY. IT IS THE LIGHT IN THE evening time. It depends ON WHICH SIDE OF THE EQUATION YOU'RE ON, WHETHER IT'S LIGHT OR DARKNESS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I feel so privileged, so blessed, SO THANKFUL BY GOD TO HAVE EYES TO SEE AND EARS to hear. Amen. AND IN NO WAY DOES IT make me feel superior to another fellow human being. Listen, there's other human beings that I like better than I like me. There's others that are nicer and more congenial. Amen. Have better attitude than I have. Amen. But they can't SEE THE TRUTH. BUT I THANK GOD NO MATTER how reprobate I've been in the past and all my fo foibless AND ALL MY COMPLEXES. I STILL SEE THE LIGHT. AMEN. FOR ME, IT'S THE RISING OF THE SUN. IT'S NOT APOSTASY. IT'S NOT DARKNESS. IT'S NOT CONFUSION. BUT IT'S ABSOLUTE TRUTH AND LIGHT. I KNOW WHERE I'M WALKING. I KNOW WHERE I CAME FROM. I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. BECAUSE WHEN THE LIGHT COMES UP, YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF YOU'RE STILL SITTING IN CONFUSION, COME TO THE MESSAGE AND LET GOD OPEN YOUR EYES. CUZ IT'S THE LIGHT THAT SHOWS YOU WHERE YOU ARE, WHO YOU ARE, WHERE YOU CAME FROM, WHERE YOU'RE GOING. IT'S THIS LIGHT THAT REVEALS the path. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE CHURCH IS CONFUSION. &gt;&gt; The systems of man are confusion. The message is the light of the hour.
