sought for healing now himself alone all in all forever jesus will i sing everything in jesus and jesus everything there isn't anything in this life satisfying as it may be as good as fine as it may be but you will find the sum total of all perfection in christ everything fades into insignificance beside him amen that was wonderful so now i've been greatly since i read that this morning greatly anticipating this special amen god bless you all [Music] once it was the blessing now it is the lord once it was the feeling now it is his word wants his gifts i wanted now the [Music] [Music] himself alone all in all forever only christ i'll sing [Music] everything is in christ and christ [Music] was anxious caring now he has the care [Music] once was what i wanted now what jesus says once was constant asking now to ceaseless praise all forever only christ i'll sing [Music] everything is in christ and [Music] now he holds me fast [Music] was constant drifting now my anchors cast once for christ and [Music] [Music] [Applause] in is is everything once it was a mystery now a secret plan once it was in heaven now in fall in man once i hoped in jesus now i know he's mine [Applause] once i thought he'd love me now i am his bride [Music] in all forever only christ i'll sing everything is in christ and christ is everything [Music] everything is in christ and christ is everything [Music] [Applause] [Music] the bride hath made herself ready she has a wedding garment on she's clothed with the word of god sealed until the day of her redemption waiting for her bridegroom to say to her
