[0:00] in the third seal brother says John said
[0:04] everybody in heaven everybody beneath
[0:06] the Earth everybody heard him where is
[0:08] this this is in this is in uh Revelation
[0:10] chapter 5 when the lamb takes the book
[0:12] amen he starts rejoicing everybody in
[0:15] heaven everything beneath the Earth
[0:16] everything heard him praising God about
[0:18] it John must have found his name on
[0:20] there you
[0:21] [Music]
[0:23] know why he saw the lamb take the book
[0:26] when the lamb take the book listen this
[0:27] is happening in Vision amen at this
[0:29] point the book is still sealed he hasn't
[0:31] even opened the seals yet that comes in
[0:33] Revelation chap 6 my brother brandom
[0:35] says John must have found his name on
[0:38] there you know the question is the book
[0:41] wasn't even open yet if it was open was
[0:43] it open to the page where John could
[0:45] look and see and then if he wrote John
[0:47] in there what kind of ink did he use and
[0:49] what kind of language did he write it
[0:54] in you understand John's in the vision
[0:57] he sees the lamb come forth he's weeping
[0:59] because he know all redemptions lost if
[1:01] nobody can take this book now an elder
[1:03] comes and tells him weep not for the
[1:05] lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed
[1:07] and overcome the take the book and the
[1:08] loose the seals thereof and he steps
[1:10] forward a bloody lamp he takes the book
[1:12] they all start rejoicing the Angels pour
[1:14] out the prayers and incense of the
[1:16] Saints amen and John starts shouting and
[1:18] rejoicing and praising God Amen brother
[1:20] B says why he must have found his name
[1:24] on there the question is how did he find
[1:26] his name on there he doesn't take the
[1:28] little book and eat it till you get get
[1:30] to Revelations chap 10 when the mighty
[1:32] Angel comes down friends this is just
[1:34] brother Chad you can take it or leave it
[1:36] but I believe it was a spiritual
[1:38] Revelation to John not something he was
[1:41] reading on paper but he was recognizing
[1:43] I'm part of that Redemption my name is
[1:46] on that book and he caught it by
[1:48] Revelation that John's in there and it
[1:51] may not be pronounced John it may not be
[1:53] spelled and John's name wasn't even John
[1:55] like we say John
[1:58] now probably had a he Brew or Armenian
[2:00] name and it was spelled with characters
[2:02] maybe we don't understand it doesn't
[2:04] matter that doesn't matter that's only
[2:06] for this Earthly existence but we have
[2:09] another identification that's not the
[2:11] name on your birth certificate and
[2:13] that's the C Gene of God that was in the
[2:14] back part of his
[2:16] [Music]
[2:18] mind and John must have
[2:20] looked and found his name in there
