[5:26] we're
[5:26] able to be here together i mean while
[5:29] we're standing let's just take our
[5:30] bibles
[5:31] go ahead and turn to genesis
[5:43] brother emmanuel it's good to see you
[5:45] brother god bless you good to see you on
[5:47] your feet and looking strong and healthy
[5:49] amen god is good praise the lord
[5:54] amen we're going to keep going in
[5:55] genesis and we're going to stick with
[5:57] this subject that we're on
[5:58] this will be part three religion versus
[6:00] relationship
[6:02] the last time i said there was going to
[6:04] be a long title you know i kind of
[6:05] bragged a little bit
[6:07] about having a long title but i never
[6:09] got to it so god had the last laugh so
[6:12] i was going to preach last time on um
[6:15] misunderstood mercy and a lack of trust
[6:18] and i never got to the lack of trust so
[6:20] the
[6:20] last time was just misunderstood mercy
[6:23] and by god's grace today we hope to
[6:25] preach on a lack of trust
[6:26] so god burst my bubble on having a nice
[6:29] preacher-sized
[6:30] title so we went to part three of
[6:34] religion versus relationship a lack of
[6:36] trust
[6:36] we just pray that god will bless us now
[6:38] let's let's read here in genesis chapter
[6:40] three
[6:42] we've been starting here each time but i
[6:44] just don't want to get away from this
[6:45] foundation
[6:46] but i want to back up just a little bit
[6:48] and start at verse 1 this time
[6:50] i'm sorry yeah i'm going to start at
[6:52] verse 1.
[6:56] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[6:58] beast of the field which the lord god
[6:59] had made
[7:00] and he said unto the woman yea hath god
[7:02] said you shall not eat
[7:04] of every tree of the garden and the
[7:06] woman said unto the serpent
[7:07] we may eat of the fruit of the trees of
[7:09] the garden but of the fruit of the tree
[7:11] which is in the midst of the garden
[7:13] god has said you shall not eat of it
[7:15] neither shall you touch it lest ye die
[7:17] and the serpent said unto the woman you
[7:19] shall not surely die
[7:21] for god does know that in the day that
[7:23] you eat thereof
[7:24] then your eyes shall be open and you
[7:26] shall be as gods knowing good
[7:28] and evil and when the woman saw that the
[7:31] tree was good for food
[7:32] and that it was pleasant to the eyes and
[7:34] a tree to be desired to make one wise
[7:37] she took of the fruit thereof and did
[7:38] eat and gave also into her husband with
[7:40] her
[7:41] and he did eat and the eyes of them both
[7:43] were open and they knew that they were
[7:45] naked and that they
[7:46] and they sewed fig leaves together and
[7:48] made themselves aprons
[7:50] and they heard the voice of the of of
[7:53] the lord god walking in the garden in
[7:54] the cool of the day
[7:56] and adam and his wife hid themselves
[7:58] from the presence of the lord god
[7:59] amongst the trees of the garden
[8:01] and the lord god called him to adam and
[8:03] said unto him
[8:04] where art thou and he said i heard thy
[8:06] voice in the garden
[8:08] and i was afraid because i was naked and
[8:10] i hid
[8:11] myself and let's just bow our heads and
[8:13] ask the lord to bless
[8:15] his word dear lord jesus we thank you
[8:18] father for the privilege
[8:19] lord of standing here again today you've
[8:22] kept us lord we thank you for restoring
[8:24] health and strength to our brother
[8:25] manuel
[8:26] that he could make the journey to be
[8:27] here nor we thank you god for what
[8:30] you're doing in our lives as you're
[8:31] lifting us higher and higher by the word
[8:33] and we're going up word by word lord and
[8:36] may this evening may you
[8:37] unveil more of yourself to us and may we
[8:39] see you lord
[8:41] clearly for who you are god feed us by
[8:44] your own hand lord have preeminence
[8:45] among us and speak your words
[8:47] give us eyes to see lord that we might
[8:49] see all you have for us
[8:51] we ask these things in jesus christ's
[8:53] name amen
[8:55] you can all be seated
[8:59] i'm going to read just a couple of
[9:02] quotes that we've been reading just to
[9:03] bring us
[9:04] back in context here but in the message
[9:07] god hiding himself in simplicity
[9:10] in 1963 the prophet of god said in the
[9:12] beginning when man sinned it showed the
[9:14] nature of man
[9:15] he always he's always trying to hide
[9:17] from god
[9:19] and make himself a way that he can feel
[9:22] justified
[9:23] a religion that's been a religion means
[9:25] a covering so he tried to make his own
[9:27] religion
[9:28] so i want you to recognize in this quote
[9:30] like we've been saying
[9:31] man has always tried to hide from god so
[9:34] his religion was a covering that he
[9:36] could hide from god
[9:38] and so the religion in the beginning was
[9:40] never intended to bring him
[9:42] into the presence of god or bring him in
[9:44] contact with god
[9:45] it was actually a barrier between him
[9:48] and god
[9:50] so he's always trying to hide from god
[9:51] and make himself a way that he can feel
[9:53] justified a religion so man
[9:56] is born with a guilty conscience fallen
[9:58] man is born with a guilty conscience and
[10:01] goes through life and he's knowing he
[10:02] knows that he's guilty and he knows that
[10:04] he's wrong
[10:05] amen there's a sense that he's wrong and
[10:06] he's always trying to find a way
[10:08] to cover his guilty conscience amen he
[10:11] wants to feel justified he wants to feel
[10:13] okay
[10:14] and so religion is a mechanism that the
[10:16] devil uses so
[10:18] readily to calm that quiet that
[10:20] guiltiness quiet
[10:22] that reservation in the heart of man so
[10:24] that he feels justified he feels that
[10:26] he's okay
[10:29] and if i've said it i don't know how
[10:31] many times i've said it yet and i don't
[10:32] know in what ways because it's
[10:34] it's so full in my heart but but man
[10:37] is is trying to feel justified he wants
[10:40] to feel that he's okay
[10:41] so religion will produce a covering
[10:45] without an atonement
[10:48] there's no shedding of blood there's
[10:49] nothing to take away a sin there's just
[10:51] a covering
[10:52] so that he could feel covered and
[10:53] justified
[10:55] free from the judgment of god and it
[10:56] actually prevents man from seeking god
[10:59] and because of religion man doesn't need
[11:02] god
[11:05] because the religion has caused him to
[11:07] feel justified
[11:11] in the message fellowship the prophet of
[11:13] god says then god made a remedy for that
[11:16] in closing i might say this in the
[11:17] garden of eden when god saw that his
[11:19] children had sin and had gone from him
[11:22] god himself who is the supreme judge
[11:24] made a reconciliation so he could
[11:26] restore that fellowship to his creatures
[11:29] by the shed blood of an animal and that
[11:31] shed blood lasted for many years
[11:33] speaking of the coming of christ
[11:35] so we see the difference in the
[11:36] relationship of a father
[11:38] amen trying to bring amen an atonement a
[11:41] sacrifice
[11:42] to for his children he wasn't bringing
[11:45] them a religious order
[11:46] he wasn't bringing them a sacrament amen
[11:49] that would that would bring a
[11:50] covering so that they could feel
[11:52] justified he was actually bringing
[11:54] something that would restore fellowship
[11:56] because god wanted to restore
[11:58] fellowship with his children so you see
[12:02] the two different sides of this that's
[12:03] why
[12:04] i've been calling this religion versus
[12:07] relationship
[12:08] because man made his own covering he
[12:11] made his own
[12:11] apron covering his own religion to hide
[12:14] his sin
[12:15] amen to make him fee itself feel
[12:17] justified like he's okay
[12:19] but god the father come down and he was
[12:21] not going to let his son stay
[12:23] behind those coverings so he came as a
[12:26] voice
[12:26] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[12:28] evening and that voice
[12:30] made made adam realize that he was naked
[12:36] his his coverings was not working amen
[12:39] and he hid himself from god
[12:40] so his religion kept him hidden from god
[12:44] but god gave a an atonement that would
[12:46] bring a reconciliation a restored
[12:48] fellowship
[12:49] so these are the principles that we're
[12:51] wanting to build on
[12:52] in the message the super sign he said
[12:55] adam he tried to make a super religion
[12:57] without an atonement
[12:59] they're still trying to do it a super
[13:00] religion make a religion so he could
[13:03] live
[13:03] any way he wanted to without an
[13:05] atonement and still have a covering
[13:07] he tried to do it in the beginning and
[13:09] he is still trying to do it
[13:12] then in the message the indictment he
[13:14] makes a statement i'm just going to pull
[13:15] out these two sentences he said that's
[13:17] the reason that you don't see these
[13:19] things happening in the churches
[13:20] they confess they believe the blood
[13:22] which would be the atonement
[13:24] so they confess that they believe in the
[13:26] atonement
[13:27] but they reject the very plan to get to
[13:29] the blood
[13:30] the word so god has made an atonement
[13:33] for his
[13:34] fallen children and that atonement was
[13:36] the sacrifice jesus made
[13:38] at calvary the shedding of blood amen as
[13:40] an atonement that would be the covering
[13:41] for our sins
[13:42] and now the religious order of the day
[13:45] the christian religious order of the day
[13:46] they say that they believe in that blood
[13:49] and they believe that blood is the
[13:50] atonement
[13:51] yet they've cut the people off from the
[13:53] path to
[13:54] that blood because the path to the blood
[13:58] is the word amen and when you when you
[14:00] deny the word amen
[14:02] how can you receive the life that was in
[14:04] the blood
[14:05] which is the life of the word amen if
[14:07] you've if you deny
[14:09] the very word which is christ
[14:13] so so now they they say they believe the
[14:16] blood but reject the very plan to get to
[14:17] the blood the word
[14:19] in the message titled the god of this
[14:21] evil age
[14:22] says now notice cain he didn't want no
[14:24] blood sacrifice
[14:26] he come down and offered the fruit or
[14:27] the fields of beauty upon his altar
[14:30] very religious done everything that just
[14:32] exactly like abel done
[14:33] offered a sacrifice fell down before god
[14:36] in worship obedient in every way
[14:38] but without the revelation of the word
[14:41] there's the key he had a religious order
[14:44] he had a worship
[14:46] he had a desire to worship he had a love
[14:48] for god
[14:50] that's what brother bam says it wasn't
[14:53] that he didn't have a love for god
[14:54] the problem is he loved himself more
[14:56] than he loved god it wasn't that he
[14:57] didn't love god
[15:00] and it's not that people are out here
[15:01] worshiping it's not that they don't love
[15:03] god amen the problem is they love
[15:05] themselves more than they love
[15:07] god and this is the fallacy of man this
[15:10] is what we have to guard against
[15:12] maybe that god gets preeminence first
[15:14] place that's what he's wanting that was
[15:16] his desire
[15:17] that was his plan and as his plan
[15:18] unfolded they had a three-phase purpose
[15:21] to his plan
[15:22] one was to get preeminence in a man he
[15:24] wanted a man that would love god more
[15:26] than he loved himself
[15:28] then he would preeminence in a bride a
[15:30] church a body
[15:31] amen and he wanted a people that would
[15:33] love him more than they love themselves
[15:36] and this has been the whole plan he goes
[15:39] on in
[15:40] and the god of this evil is to say and
[15:42] the word was
[15:43] from the beginning god's plan but god
[15:46] revealed by revelation the very thing
[15:49] that he vindicated and punctuated that
[15:51] that was right
[15:52] not religion not an altar not belonging
[15:55] to church
[15:56] not making a sacrifice not being sincere
[15:59] but by the revelation of the word of god
[16:03] so that's the thing that matters it
[16:05] mattered in that day with abel and it
[16:06] matters today
[16:09] the revelation by the word of god
[16:11] because the word is the path
[16:12] to the blood to the atonement that will
[16:14] bring us back in reconciliation
[16:17] back in fellowship with god let's go
[16:20] look at genesis chapter 4 again
[16:24] genesis chapter 4 we'll begin at verse
[16:26] 10.
[16:29] i am going back and rev viewing a little
[16:31] bit from sunday
[16:32] so that we can continue on i told you at
[16:35] the beginning of this i made a
[16:36] commitment
[16:38] uh to myself that i was not going to
[16:39] rush
[16:41] and that means we go back over a little
[16:43] bit we'll go back over a little bit but
[16:44] i'm not going to get in a hurry
[16:46] it's always my problem my my the thing
[16:48] that i've always struggled
[16:50] with and preaching is i always feel like
[16:51] i try to put too much into one service
[16:54] and i'm just going to take my time now
[16:56] amen if you'll bear with me so if you
[16:58] say brother ted we've heard this again
[16:59] i know but just be patient
[17:03] with me genesis chapter 4 verse 10
[17:09] and he said what hast thou done the
[17:11] voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto
[17:13] me from the ground
[17:14] and now with thou cursed from the earth
[17:16] which hath opened her mouth
[17:18] to receive thy brother's blood from thy
[17:19] hand when thou tilt the ground it shall
[17:21] know
[17:22] not henceforth yield unto thee her
[17:24] strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt
[17:26] thou be in the
[17:27] in the earth and cain said unto the lord
[17:30] my punishment is greater than i can bear
[17:33] behold thou has driven me out this day
[17:35] from the face of the earth
[17:36] and from thy faith shall i be hid and i
[17:39] shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in
[17:41] the earth
[17:42] and it shall come to pass that every one
[17:43] that findeth me shall slay me
[17:46] and the lord said unto him therefore
[17:48] therefore whosoever slayeth came
[17:49] vengeance shall be taken on him
[17:51] sevenfold and the lord set a mark upon
[17:54] cain lest any finding him
[17:56] should kill him so now we we want to
[17:58] just
[17:59] review from last sunday that that
[18:02] you know we know that cain had a
[18:04] discussion with abel god had admonished
[18:06] cain
[18:07] for having his countenance fallen and
[18:09] and being wrothful with god
[18:11] over god rejecting his sacrifice and he
[18:14] said just
[18:14] if you do well will it go well with thee
[18:17] amen and and brother brahm tells us he
[18:19] told him just do as your brother abel
[18:20] just repeat what you saw
[18:22] amen but but he couldn't do it and when
[18:24] he had a conversation with abel whatever
[18:26] abel told him
[18:27] and we know abel had the revelation of
[18:29] what went wrong in the garden
[18:31] because he had the revelation of a blood
[18:33] atonement
[18:35] and so whatever conversation they had
[18:37] made cain so angry
[18:38] that he slew his brother and now when
[18:41] god comes to
[18:42] him to correct him he lies to god and
[18:44] it's just showing the nature of the
[18:46] serpent seed
[18:47] that cain amen had a nature that would
[18:50] defy
[18:50] god and that was the kind of nature that
[18:52] lucifer had in the rebellion in heaven
[18:55] and now that nature is found on earth in
[18:57] humanity
[19:00] and and god says where is thy brother
[19:02] abel and he says
[19:03] i don't know he's lying
[19:07] he said i'm on my brother's keeper and
[19:09] go and god begins to tell him he knows
[19:11] he identifies what happened he unveils
[19:13] the whole thing and he and he
[19:14] curses cain and he says that shall be a
[19:17] fugitive and a vagabond
[19:19] on the earth it'll no longer yield her
[19:20] strength when thou tilt the ground
[19:22] and he put a curse and instead of cain
[19:24] becoming humble and repentant
[19:26] amen he becomes more defiant he's still
[19:29] wrathful he's still angry
[19:30] and he and he speaks back to god and he
[19:33] and he calls
[19:34] god unjust because he says my
[19:38] punishment is more than i can bear
[19:41] and so the the point that we want to get
[19:43] to here is remind you that
[19:45] then god he says my punishment is more
[19:49] than i can bear
[19:50] for i will be a fugitive and the
[19:51] vagabond in the earth and it'll come to
[19:53] pass that
[19:54] anybody who finds me everyone that'll
[19:55] find me will slay me
[19:57] and the lord said in verse 15 the lord
[19:59] said therefore whosoever slave cain
[20:00] vincent shall be taken on him sevenfold
[20:03] and the lord set a mark upon cain lest
[20:05] any find him
[20:07] shall kill him and so now it looks as
[20:10] though
[20:10] that god is agreeing with cain
[20:15] that your punishment is too much and you
[20:17] know they find you say okay cain
[20:19] you've got a point
[20:22] now i'm going to put protection upon
[20:26] cain
[20:27] and whoever slays cain vinji shall be
[20:29] taken on them
[20:30] sevenfold and he put a mark upon cain
[20:34] the mark of the beast lest any finding
[20:36] him should kill him
[20:37] so immediately what we identify
[20:41] as the mark of the beast and for us we
[20:43] know to be such a wicked evil thing
[20:46] if you go back in this day decaying
[20:49] the mark that was a put upon him was a
[20:51] mark for protection
[20:54] and the mark of the beast protected cain
[20:58] so you can see how he can misunderstand
[21:01] this mark
[21:03] the mark would protect him from anybody
[21:06] else harming him
[21:07] so it was god who put the mark upon him
[21:10] and the mark that god put on him was a
[21:12] mark of protection
[21:13] and god amen god put
[21:16] a curse upon anybody that would harm him
[21:20] so it's almost as if god is standing up
[21:23] for cain or defending
[21:24] he is defending him against being slain
[21:27] then verse 16 and cain went out from the
[21:29] presence of the lord and dwelt in the
[21:31] land of nod
[21:32] on the east of eden and cain knew his
[21:34] wife
[21:35] and she conceived and bear enoch and he
[21:37] builded a city and called the name of
[21:39] the city
[21:39] after the name of the son enoch so here
[21:43] we see that he went
[21:44] out from the presence of the lord and he
[21:47] was fine
[21:48] going out from the presence of the lord
[21:50] going out from the presence of the lord
[21:51] didn't grieve cain
[21:53] losing his life upon the earth grieved
[21:56] him but
[21:58] being a vagabond and a fugitive grieved
[22:01] him amen
[22:02] but going on from the presence of the
[22:03] lord now he goes out from the presence
[22:04] of the lord
[22:05] he goes to the land of nod he has a son
[22:08] and he begins to establish he begins to
[22:10] build a city and this building a city
[22:12] means to establish
[22:13] amen or to cause to continue so now his
[22:17] very
[22:17] action that he's taking is defying
[22:20] the very curse that god put upon him
[22:23] because this curse to be a fugitive in a
[22:25] vagabond
[22:26] means that he would be unstable
[22:28] unsettled amen and he would wonder
[22:30] about amen and so there was going to be
[22:32] no stability to cain
[22:34] so cain goes out to the land of none
[22:36] which is wandering he
[22:37] take he he knows his wife he has a son
[22:40] and he starts to build a city
[22:42] or he starts to be established
[22:45] and caused to continue it looks like
[22:47] he's putting down roots amen
[22:51] so we find that that now this line of
[22:54] cane they become those who are
[22:58] uh in the arts they begin to uh
[23:01] bring out metallurgy they begin to make
[23:03] craft they begin to prosper they begin
[23:05] to build cities
[23:06] uh they begin to have trade and industry
[23:09] and all of these things and science and
[23:11] art and achievement
[23:13] all came through the line of cane
[23:16] so it looks like they're blessed
[23:20] it looks like they're the ones who are
[23:22] blessed seth brother
[23:24] tells us seth continues to be a a
[23:26] herdsman a men
[23:28] following the flock living in tents amen
[23:30] living in small family groups and moving
[23:32] about
[23:33] and following the herd it looks like
[23:35] seth's line are the wanderers
[23:37] and it looks like cain's line are the
[23:39] ones who are established in the earth
[23:41] and it looks like they're the ones who
[23:42] are blessed
[23:44] it just shows how the carnal mind gets
[23:46] the things of god
[23:47] so absolutely topsy-turvy and backwards
[23:50] because to be established amen is to be
[23:53] established in the word amen and it said
[23:55] that cessne after he had a son
[23:57] amen then men begin to call on the name
[24:00] of the lord
[24:00] then seth as he was wandering about in
[24:03] enos and this
[24:04] and the righteous line was wandering
[24:05] about following the herd and following
[24:07] the flocks and farming and
[24:09] and following them as they go to pasture
[24:11] grazing as they were moving about on the
[24:13] earth
[24:14] they were seeking the name of the lord
[24:16] amen and they were becoming established
[24:20] established in the faith established as
[24:23] the righteous line of god
[24:24] but in humility amen not in science not
[24:27] in achievement not in building the
[24:29] cities
[24:29] and it just goes to show that there's no
[24:32] security in that amen
[24:33] there's no stability in that that you
[24:36] can have a city you can have a walled
[24:38] city
[24:38] and be a fugitive and a vagabond upon
[24:41] this earth
[24:42] you can have a fat bank account and a
[24:44] good job and a house that's paid for
[24:46] and if you don't seek the name of the
[24:48] lord and have no relationship with god
[24:50] you are a fugitive and a vagabond upon
[24:52] this earth you are
[24:53] unstable unsettled wavering about
[24:56] wandering from place to place
[25:02] but cain never stopped being religious
[25:06] he continued to worship amen the prophet
[25:09] of god tells us these things
[25:10] he continues to worship he continues to
[25:13] be religious
[25:14] he continues his religious practices
[25:16] amen
[25:18] but they're unstable they're unsteady
[25:21] now he begins to fashion more imaginary
[25:25] ways to worship
[25:27] more rituals and sacrifices and gods and
[25:30] idols and all of these things because
[25:32] he's a fugitive and a vagabond
[25:36] and so it works down cain's line
[25:40] and and i just presented to you this way
[25:44] can you see how it'd be possible to be
[25:47] in cain's line
[25:49] and believe that you were the righteous
[25:51] line
[25:53] to be in cain's line with the cities and
[25:56] the scientific advancement
[25:57] and the and the growing uh the growing
[26:00] of merchandise and trade
[26:02] and industry and arts and music and
[26:05] building in your cities your temples and
[26:07] your places of worship
[26:09] and all the metal that goes to to start
[26:11] digging out gold and precious gems and
[26:13] all of the things that they're mining
[26:15] out of the earth to create a house of
[26:17] worship
[26:17] and where you can look out at seth and
[26:19] you can see that they don't have a
[26:21] temple they don't have a method for
[26:23] worship they don't
[26:24] have an idol they bow to or a place to
[26:26] burn in censor
[26:28] they just move amen following the herds
[26:31] and following the flocks
[26:32] now you can be in king's line and
[26:34] generationally coming down
[26:36] and believe that this mark that was put
[26:39] upon cain
[26:40] is a protection for cain and cain's line
[26:44] that we've been marked by god
[26:49] who marked them god why did god mark him
[26:53] to protect him
[26:55] now you can see how this mercy can be
[26:57] misunderstood
[27:00] god did it for his own purpose but they
[27:03] begin to misunderstand
[27:05] i want to drop down to lamech now and
[27:08] see this
[27:09] attitude this approach
[27:12] verse 23 and lamech said unto his wives
[27:16] ada and zela hear me hear my voice
[27:19] ye wives of lamech hearken unto my
[27:21] speech for i've slain a man to my
[27:23] wounding and a young man to my heart
[27:25] if cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly
[27:28] lamech 70
[27:29] and sevenfold and all of a sudden he's
[27:33] looking back
[27:34] at what happened with cain as though
[27:36] it's a good thing amen
[27:38] now god would avenge anybody that would
[27:40] destroy cain
[27:42] and here i am i've come down from cain
[27:44] i'm in this lineage
[27:46] and if if god will do that for cain then
[27:48] what will he do for me
[27:51] if he'll avenge cain sevenfold then
[27:53] we'll eventually make
[27:54] seventy times seven fold
[27:58] and you can see by his very attitude and
[28:00] his very approach
[28:01] that he believes he's righteous and he
[28:02] believes he's justified and he's
[28:04] justified in all these things and if god
[28:06] will do that for cain then he'll do this
[28:07] for me
[28:10] and lost sight that this was the
[28:14] rebellion against god
[28:18] but i just want to point out
[28:21] that when you count the genealogies
[28:25] lamech would be the seventh in the line
[28:27] of the unrighteous seed
[28:29] and the serpent seed because when you
[28:32] get to enoch enoch is the seventh
[28:35] from adam we know that lamech doesn't
[28:37] come from adam
[28:38] lamech would come down that line from
[28:40] the serpent but he comes in the seventh
[28:42] he's the seventh generation
[28:44] just like enoch would be the seventh
[28:46] generation from adam amen so you would
[28:48] go serpent to cain and all the way down
[28:50] through
[28:50] until you come to lamech the seventh and
[28:52] he's a type of the seventh apostate
[28:54] church
[28:55] he's a type of the seventh church age
[29:00] let's go pick this up in revelation
[29:02] chapter three
[29:06] everything in the bible is for a reason
[29:10] so now we come to the seventh amen and
[29:13] it's amazing that
[29:14] in the record of the bible and the
[29:16] record of cain's line it stops right
[29:18] here with lamech
[29:19] it doesn't go on it goes to the seventh
[29:23] which is going to type the seventh
[29:24] church age
[29:26] or i'd say the seventh apostate church
[29:29] because the church ages is the weaving
[29:32] together
[29:33] amen of two vines
[29:36] the righteous vine and the unrighteous
[29:38] amen there's a weaving together of the
[29:39] true and the false vine
[29:40] through the church ages and so now we
[29:42] know there's a true church and there's
[29:44] an apostate church amen in every church
[29:46] age
[29:47] so lamech would be a type of the
[29:48] apostate church and when we come to
[29:50] revelation chapter 3
[29:52] verse 17 he says because thou sayest
[29:55] i am rich and increased with goods and
[29:57] have need of nothing
[30:00] and knowest thou not thou are wretched
[30:03] and miserable and poor and blind
[30:06] and naked now you find the seventh
[30:09] apostate church
[30:11] in the same condition lamech was in
[30:13] lamech thought he was righteous and the
[30:15] lamech thought he was justified and
[30:17] lamech thought god would stand up for
[30:18] him
[30:20] but it was after this generation that
[30:21] the flood would come and they would all
[30:23] be destroyed
[30:25] but he thought that god would stand up
[30:27] for him let's pick it up in verse 18
[30:29] let's read revelation 18
[30:31] 2 and see this condition of this church
[30:34] in the end time revelation 18
[30:40] and 7
[30:43] how much she hath glorified herself and
[30:46] lived deliciously
[30:47] so much torment and sorrow give her for
[30:49] she saith in her heart i sit a queen
[30:52] and am no widow and shall see no sorrow
[30:55] therefore shall her plagues come in one
[30:57] day death
[30:58] and mourning and famine and she shall be
[31:00] utterly burned with fire for strong as
[31:02] the lord who judgeth her
[31:05] it's the same attitude it's the same
[31:07] approach amen this is the false church
[31:09] at the end
[31:09] she she she she has glorified herself
[31:13] and lived deliciously so much torment
[31:14] and sorrow give her for she saved in her
[31:16] heart
[31:16] i sit a queen and am no widow and shall
[31:18] see no sorrow
[31:20] she did not see her condition she saw
[31:23] herself righteous
[31:25] she saw herself married to christ
[31:28] the queen of heaven she said i am no
[31:32] widow
[31:33] and i will see no sorrow and it was in
[31:35] that very day that she makes this
[31:37] declaration
[31:38] amen that her her plague shall come in
[31:40] one hour that she will be destroyed
[31:43] and this is speaking of the seventh
[31:44] apostate church are the church in the
[31:46] seventh church age
[31:48] they come to the front where they think
[31:50] they're righteous
[31:51] they're in the righteous line they're
[31:53] the righteous seed
[31:54] that god is sticking up for them god is
[31:57] blessing them
[31:58] and they're misunderstanding the mercy
[32:00] of god because god sends the rain on the
[32:02] just and the unjust
[32:03] and the rain falling and the blessings
[32:05] coming is no indication
[32:07] of what is in the root of that seed
[32:10] amen just because god is a good god
[32:13] and his blessings continue to pour upon
[32:16] this earth amen
[32:17] and he continues to heal and he
[32:19] continues to deliver and he continues to
[32:21] supply
[32:22] amen and when the rain falls brother
[32:24] branham said he saw in the vision
[32:26] there was a wheat and then that wheat
[32:27] had tares and in that wheat
[32:29] and the field had wheat and the field
[32:30] had tears amen and all of a sudden they
[32:32] were all hanging their heads and there
[32:34] was a drought
[32:35] and they needed rain and he said and a
[32:37] good revival rain came sweeping through
[32:39] there
[32:40] and the rain come from god by the mercy
[32:42] of god
[32:43] and the rain fell on the whole field
[32:47] and he said and the wheat lifted up
[32:48] their heads and said glory to god praise
[32:51] the lord and the tares lifted up their
[32:53] heads and say glory to god praise the
[32:55] lord
[32:58] so the mercies of god and the blessings
[33:00] of god
[33:01] are no indication of righteousness
[33:07] and that was the mistake lamech lamech
[33:09] was in a cursed line
[33:11] amen but he was protected by god and
[33:13] there was blessings
[33:14] carnal blessings poured upon this line
[33:20] and he thought surely god won't destroy
[33:24] me
[33:26] surely god won't
[33:30] judge me
[33:34] i sit a queen and am no widow
[33:38] i'm rich and increased with goods
[33:41] and have need of nothing and knowest
[33:44] thou
[33:45] not you're in the unrighteous line
[33:48] you're the false vine and this is the
[33:51] day of your destruction
[33:55] lamech who thought god would stick up
[33:56] for him was the very generation that
[33:58] would be wiped out by a flood
[34:02] praise be to god
[34:05] so it doesn't matter
[34:08] i shouldn't say it like that but you
[34:11] cannot take the mercy and blessings of
[34:13] god
[34:14] as an indication or a security that
[34:17] you're right with god
[34:22] you cannot take the the
[34:25] the blessings and the mercy the rain
[34:27] that pours on the just and the unjust
[34:29] and you cannot claim that amen somehow
[34:32] is a justification that you're
[34:34] right with god because the laodicean
[34:36] church the apostate church
[34:37] thought she was rich and increased with
[34:39] goods and had need of nothing
[34:40] and didn't know that her spiritual
[34:42] condition was miserable poor wretched
[34:45] blind and naked
[34:48] so we cannot look to the carnal things
[34:50] we cannot look to the blessings
[34:52] amen we must look to the word of god
[34:54] because god's plan from the beginning
[34:56] was the was the revelation of the word
[35:00] and god gave his word he meant to his
[35:02] children and his children
[35:03] followed his word
[35:06] let's continue on in the message satan's
[35:09] eden
[35:11] so but now the cunningness of the devil
[35:13] now makes the people believe that they
[35:15] are christians when they're not
[35:19] further on he says and that's why satan
[35:21] has done this
[35:23] and he has worked through the ministry
[35:24] to do it as god promised he would do now
[35:27] he begin by a religious deceit in eden
[35:29] and has continued ever since
[35:32] not by setting up a bunch of communists
[35:34] communist has nothing to do with this
[35:35] it's the church
[35:36] that's where you have to watch see it's
[35:39] not the communists that would deceive
[35:41] the very elect
[35:42] it's the church that'll deceive the very
[35:44] elect
[35:45] oh this is a big statement amen where's
[35:48] the deception come from it comes from
[35:50] the church amen
[35:51] it comes from the false vine it comes
[35:53] from the church it comes from that
[35:54] religious system amen
[35:56] not from something else it comes from
[35:58] the religious system
[36:01] he says there's a church that'll deceive
[36:03] the very lexi it isn't communism we know
[36:06] that
[36:06] they deny god and their antichrist sure
[36:08] they are in principle
[36:09] but they are not the antichrist the
[36:12] antichrist is religious
[36:16] very religious so the antichrist is
[36:20] religious
[36:20] very religious and can quote the
[36:22] scripture and make it look so plain
[36:26] so when we're looking for the antichrist
[36:28] don't be looking amen
[36:30] don't don't don't be out there looking
[36:32] for the bum on the street or the harlot
[36:34] or the prostitute
[36:35] i mean that's not the antichrist the
[36:37] antichrist is religious
[36:38] very religious and can quote the
[36:41] scripture and make it look so plain
[36:45] let's go to back to genesis
[36:48] go to genesis chapter 6.
[36:52] just keep going
[36:55] here through the book of genesis
[37:04] in genesis chapter 6 verse 1 it says and
[37:06] it came to pass
[37:07] when men began to multiply on the face
[37:09] of the earth and daughters were born
[37:10] unto them
[37:11] that the sons of god saw the daughters
[37:13] of men that they were fair
[37:15] and they took them wise of all which
[37:16] they chose and the lord said my spirit
[37:19] shall not always strive with man for
[37:20] that
[37:21] he also is flesh yet his days shall be a
[37:24] hundred and twenty years
[37:26] so these two lines were moving on down
[37:29] through time and
[37:30] generations were coming and going and
[37:32] and they were
[37:33] the one line was building cities and
[37:35] doing all the things that they were
[37:36] doing
[37:37] and god just let it go because cess line
[37:39] was
[37:40] calling on the name of the lord and god
[37:42] was not intervening in whatever cain and
[37:45] all of his were doing and all the
[37:47] science and the arts and the music and
[37:49] the
[37:49] cities and he wasn't intervening in that
[37:52] amen but when
[37:53] now when the sons of god began to mingle
[37:56] with these two lines
[37:57] god was going to come down and put a
[37:59] stop to it right now
[38:00] because god this is not what god wants
[38:03] god wanted to separate out his children
[38:05] and he wanted his children to be in
[38:07] fellowship with him in communion with
[38:09] him
[38:09] he didn't want him to get back mixed in
[38:11] with this and when they began to get
[38:13] mixed in
[38:14] then god come down and put a stop to it
[38:18] now let's go to verse nine then we know
[38:20] the story of the flood and i'm not going
[38:21] to get into that
[38:22] uh not today but anyways god
[38:25] god he saw the wickedness man was great
[38:28] and everything they imagined in their
[38:29] heart was evil continually
[38:31] and he repented that he had made man
[38:33] upon the earth and he was going to
[38:34] destroy it
[38:35] but noah found grace in his eyes and god
[38:37] was going to make a way of escape
[38:39] through the ark
[38:40] and he gave no instructions on how to
[38:42] build the ark and the ark was nothing
[38:44] more than the word for their day
[38:46] [Music]
[38:47] i just want to i want to drive that home
[38:49] i want to drive at home
[38:50] so such a reality amen until the the
[38:53] bible comes alive today
[38:54] that the ark was the manifested word for
[38:56] their day
[38:58] because what god made in the form of
[39:00] protection amen was pointing all the way
[39:02] over to the new testament amen
[39:04] because what he made was an ark with
[39:06] three levels because brother branham
[39:07] said that's my ministry justification
[39:10] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[39:12] but at the top amen there was a window
[39:14] amen
[39:15] and that window amen was a window unto
[39:17] heaven and through that window would
[39:19] come the message of salvation
[39:21] the message that the judgment has passed
[39:25] so the whole ark was even speaking the
[39:27] word of god
[39:29] it wasn't just a boat amen the whole
[39:31] construction of it amen was you work
[39:33] your way up
[39:34] and then the small window up to heaven
[39:36] amen was all
[39:37] speaking of justification sanctification
[39:39] the baptism holy ghost and a door open
[39:41] in heaven
[39:43] in the laodicean church age so this
[39:47] this whole ark was given the word was
[39:49] given through a prophet amen
[39:51] and it was given out to the people and
[39:52] and brother brandon said this it wasn't
[39:54] something that was done in a corner
[39:56] you couldn't hide that boat
[39:59] it was huge the the world at that time
[40:01] knew what was going on amen
[40:03] and brother bam says many many things
[40:04] about that but the way of salvation was
[40:07] going to be
[40:08] to come into the manifested word for
[40:10] that day and it was going to be the only
[40:12] way
[40:13] it didn't matter what you thought about
[40:14] it and then it didn't matter if you
[40:16] thought it was a good idea a bad
[40:17] idea whether noah was a good person a
[40:19] bad person
[40:20] it didn't matter what you thought about
[40:22] noah what you thought about noah's
[40:23] family
[40:24] what you thought about his carpentry
[40:25] skills none of that mattered for noah
[40:27] had the word of god for his day
[40:29] amen and noah believing that word it was
[40:32] righteous and
[40:33] in the righteous line amen
[40:37] and it was an opportunity
[40:40] for whosoever will to come to the word
[40:44] but the only ones who would come are the
[40:46] ones who are ordained to
[40:49] so what god has done in the bible has
[40:52] been the same story
[40:53] over and over and over and over again
[40:57] changes the names of the characters
[40:59] changes the circumstances
[41:00] you know changes it from a boat to an
[41:02] exodus journey to a king to
[41:05] but it's the same story over and over
[41:07] again
[41:10] so now they they they uh have the
[41:13] judgment the floods come and they
[41:14] destroy
[41:15] and then they destroy everything but but
[41:17] the souls that were in this boat which
[41:20] was noah
[41:20] and his three sons and their wives amen
[41:23] and then
[41:23] then the they're there and after the
[41:26] judgments passed we know all of that
[41:28] but then they come out upon the earth
[41:30] and we're going to come to revelation
[41:31] chapter 9. revelation chapter 9
[41:35] and we'll read verse 1
[41:38] and god blessed noah and his sons and
[41:40] said unto them
[41:42] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[41:44] the earth
[41:46] now when they come out of the ark god is
[41:49] going to give them their instructions
[41:51] for this new dispensation
[41:54] and now what comes out is noah
[41:58] and his three sons and their wives and
[42:00] then
[42:01] all the animals that were with them on
[42:03] the ark and now they come
[42:04] out and he gives them this commandment
[42:08] it says be fruitful and multiply and
[42:10] replenish the earth
[42:12] now that becomes the word for their day
[42:17] now let's go down to verse 7 it says and
[42:20] you
[42:20] be fruitful and multiply bring forth
[42:23] abundantly in the earth
[42:25] and multiply therein so
[42:28] what god wants to do god wants them to
[42:31] go
[42:31] forth here from mount ararat and he
[42:34] wants
[42:35] them to go out and replenish the earth
[42:37] he wants them to multiply
[42:38] abundantly upon the earth because god
[42:41] always wanted to fill the earth with his
[42:43] sons and daughters
[42:45] that was god's plan from the beginning
[42:47] and and now
[42:48] he tells him to go out and multiply and
[42:51] replenish he goes bring forth abundantly
[42:53] upon the earth so he wants him to go
[42:55] from there
[42:56] and he wants him to go and fill the
[42:57] earth
[43:00] praise god so i want that i want that to
[43:03] lock in
[43:05] that's the word for the day
[43:09] now let's skip over to genesis chapter
[43:11] 10
[43:12] and start reading in verse 8.
[43:17] there's another character we've got to
[43:18] bring in
[43:23] verse 8 and cush begotten nimrod
[43:28] now kush is the son of ham and him was
[43:29] the son of noah so nobody got ham
[43:31] hamburg
[43:32] cush and it says and cush begotten
[43:34] nimrod
[43:35] he began to be a mighty one in the earth
[43:38] he was a mighty hunter before the lord
[43:40] wherefore it is said even as nimrod the
[43:42] mighty hunter before the lord
[43:44] and the beginning of his kingdom was
[43:45] babel and eric
[43:47] and akkad and kaunai in the land of
[43:50] shinar
[43:51] out of that land went forth asher and
[43:53] built in nineveh and the city rehab off
[43:56] and
[43:56] kayla and resin between nineveh and kela
[43:59] the same as a
[44:00] great city so now when we get into the
[44:02] genealogies
[44:04] amen they're just running through this
[44:05] one we got this one we got this one we
[44:06] got this one and
[44:08] all of a sudden there's an insertion
[44:09] here of this character named nimrod
[44:11] and so much is said about him in
[44:13] comparison to what's said about
[44:15] everybody else
[44:16] because what's said about everybody else
[44:18] is almost nothing but now nimrod
[44:20] began to be a mighty one a great one
[44:22] upon the earth he began to be a mighty
[44:24] hunter before the lord
[44:26] amen and he went out and he began to
[44:28] build a kingdom and it started at babel
[44:30] and from there he conquered shinar and
[44:33] all of assyria and he had a mighty
[44:35] kingdom
[44:36] so this is the this is the the first one
[44:39] that's
[44:40] mentioned that has a large kingdom upon
[44:43] the earth or is going to be a mighty
[44:44] king upon the earth
[44:47] and has a large that's a that's that's
[44:50] almost
[44:51] all of mesopotamia so it's a huge area
[44:54] that he was going to rule over
[44:57] there's a reason it's in the bible like
[44:59] that
[45:01] brother banham said in the message
[45:03] israel in the church from 1953 he said
[45:06] for this is the day brethren
[45:07] you'll bear me record a day of isms i've
[45:10] been studying genesis now for two years
[45:12] of genesis that's the beginning the
[45:15] going forth to seed chapter
[45:16] and notice that all these cults of this
[45:18] day are beginning in genesis
[45:21] and had their start back in genesis
[45:22] winding up out here
[45:24] in the last day for instance many of
[45:26] them like how the formal religion began
[45:28] and came
[45:30] how it come on out out and come down
[45:32] through the sons of noah ham out of ham
[45:34] he had nimrod nimrod built the tower of
[45:36] babel babel comes on down through king
[45:38] nebuchadnezzar's time
[45:39] and on out into revelations babylon how
[45:42] that little seed started way back there
[45:45] at the east side
[45:46] of the gates of eden come on down
[45:48] winding out
[45:49] all kinds of cults and everything
[45:51] started back there winding themselves
[45:53] out to the end
[45:55] now what brother benham just gave us
[45:56] here in this quote in 1953
[45:58] he just gave us the whole path of the
[46:01] of the of the devil amen and the devil's
[46:03] religion all the way back
[46:05] from something that started as a seed on
[46:08] the eastern at the eastern gate at the
[46:10] east of
[46:10] of eden when cain and abel come to bring
[46:13] their offerings
[46:14] amen one started a man-made religion
[46:17] and the other one began to worship god
[46:19] by a divine revelation
[46:21] and right from there starts to two seeds
[46:23] that's god that's going to be
[46:25] weaving all the way through the bible
[46:27] amen and so when you want to talk about
[46:29] the trail of the serpent
[46:31] that's where the trail of the serpent
[46:32] begins amen and it weaves
[46:34] all the way down to the book of
[46:36] revelation
[46:38] and what is it it's these two it's the
[46:40] twins amen
[46:42] it's always been twins amen two forms of
[46:44] religious worship one by the ideas of
[46:46] man
[46:47] one by the idea of god amen one by man's
[46:50] efforts and man's ability and man's
[46:51] wisdom
[46:52] one with no of none of man's ability
[46:54] none of man's wisdom but by
[46:56] a divine revelation of god and this is
[46:59] going to mark the righteous seed those
[47:01] who have an imputation of righteousness
[47:03] because they were able to believe god
[47:06] and being able to believe god and
[47:08] righteousness will be imputed unto them
[47:10] so the righteous line will be able to
[47:12] believe god not believe
[47:14] in god because cain believed in god
[47:17] nimrod believed in god nebuchadnezzar
[47:20] believed in god amen they all believed
[47:22] in god
[47:23] but there was a line that believed god
[47:25] and what he
[47:26] said they said amen
[47:29] and when they believed god
[47:32] they had faith and without faith it is
[47:35] impossible
[47:36] to please god so there was one line that
[47:40] would
[47:40] please god by faith
[47:43] and there was one line amen that would
[47:46] always be
[47:47] trying to swallow this line up
[47:50] and these two vines begin from the roots
[47:53] right there
[47:54] and they start to twist
[47:57] and they start twisting before the flood
[47:59] when the suns have gone
[48:00] saw the daughters of men and right there
[48:02] those vines started to overlap
[48:05] and god come down to cut it off amen
[48:07] he's going to cut it off and destroy it
[48:09] but out of the ark because brother
[48:10] benham said that seed came through the
[48:12] ark and man it came through the women
[48:14] like it did in eden
[48:15] and it came through the ark and it came
[48:16] out of the ark amen and
[48:18] when it came out of the ark it was
[48:19] closer than it was before
[48:22] because now the bible will say amen the
[48:25] sons of noah
[48:26] were ham sham and japheth amen
[48:30] and now we have the sons of noah ham
[48:33] shem and japheth
[48:34] and out of them comes everybody but
[48:36] somehow through that
[48:38] is coming this false vine
[48:41] and now it it's hard to detect it's
[48:43] harder than it was before so now those
[48:48] two vines are weaving tighter
[48:51] and tighter and tighter
[48:55] until the end time when a prophet would
[48:57] come and open this and god would open
[48:59] the seals through a prophet and he would
[49:00] start to
[49:00] unwind these two vines
[49:06] praise gone started all the way back
[49:10] and then winding themselves out to the
[49:12] end
[49:13] so the false religion started in cain
[49:16] come down through the sons of noah
[49:18] ham from ham to nimrod nimrob at the
[49:20] time of babel
[49:21] come down through king nebuchadnezzar
[49:23] time and all the way out to revelation
[49:25] as babylon
[49:27] so what started is just moving all the
[49:29] way down through it's progressing all
[49:31] the way down through
[49:32] but the righteous line is progressing
[49:34] all the way down through as well
[49:37] let's look at genesis 11
[49:41] verse 1. and the whole earth was of one
[49:46] language
[49:47] and of one speech and they came to pass
[49:50] as they journey from the east that they
[49:52] found a plane in the land of shinar and
[49:54] they dwelt there
[49:55] and they said one to another go-to let
[49:57] us make brick and burn them thoroughly
[50:00] and they had brick for stone and slime
[50:02] had they for mortar
[50:04] and they said go too let us build us a
[50:06] city and the tower
[50:09] whose top may reach unto heaven and let
[50:11] us make us a name
[50:12] lest we be scattered abroad upon the
[50:14] face of the whole earth
[50:18] amen now they've they've they've come
[50:21] out of the
[50:22] ark and they've been given a commission
[50:23] from god to go forth and multiply
[50:26] replenish
[50:27] and multiply abundantly upon the face of
[50:29] the earth amen and now as they're
[50:30] traveling east they come to the valley
[50:32] of shinar
[50:33] and they said now they were one language
[50:36] one speech
[50:37] and they said not let us make brick
[50:40] and burn them thoroughly they had brick
[50:43] for stone and slime they had for mortar
[50:45] and they said go to let us build us a
[50:47] city and the tower
[50:48] whose top may reach unto heaven and let
[50:51] us make us a name
[50:53] lest we be scattered abroad upon the
[50:55] face of the whole earth
[51:00] when they began to speak like this
[51:05] it was an antichrist spirit
[51:10] because when they came out of the ark
[51:13] god
[51:13] said unto noah and to his sons and to
[51:16] their wives
[51:17] multiply and replenish the earth and
[51:20] tell them to go forth
[51:21] and multiply abundantly upon the face of
[51:24] the earth
[51:25] god was going to scatter them throughout
[51:27] the earth amen but now they come to
[51:29] shinar
[51:29] and they said no let's stop here
[51:33] let's make bricks and they took bricks
[51:35] and mourner said let's build us a city
[51:37] and a tower whose top will reach into
[51:39] god and make a name for ourselves
[51:43] not the name of the lord not a name for
[51:44] god but let us make a name for ourselves
[51:47] lest we should be scattered about the
[51:49] earth and
[51:50] right here they are anti-word because
[51:52] the word said go out and replenish the
[51:54] earth
[51:56] because the plan of god is always the
[51:58] manifested word for that day
[52:00] and those who would follow god's word
[52:02] would go out not ban themselves together
[52:04] not make for themselves a name
[52:06] but go out and separate and replenish
[52:08] the earth like god said
[52:09] but here comes that devil anointing amen
[52:12] upon a group of people and upon nimrod
[52:14] amen and that devil anointing will get
[52:17] him to defy the very commandment of god
[52:22] he said let us bend ourselves together
[52:28] and he says let us build a city
[52:33] and a tower
[52:36] a city is civil government civil society
[52:41] and a tower is religious
[52:45] remember this tower unto heaven and
[52:47] right here you have the first
[52:49] unification of the ecclesiastical
[52:51] and the civil horns
[52:54] and we find it again over in revelation
[52:56] chapter 13
[52:58] the beast that's rising up out of the
[53:00] land with two horns like a lamb there's
[53:02] a buffalo brother behind tells us that
[53:03] that's america and they're going to
[53:04] unite the ecclesiastical and civil horns
[53:07] but it didn't originate in revelation
[53:09] because nothing originates in revelation
[53:11] it originates in genesis so that
[53:14] very program amen that's going to bring
[53:16] about amen an image to the beast
[53:19] and a reviving of the beast of the
[53:20] worship of the beast is going to be
[53:23] this same system that started right here
[53:25] friends
[53:27] where they take let's build us a city
[53:31] civil government let's build us a tower
[53:34] religious and they're going to unite
[53:37] civil and ecclesiastically
[53:41] everything started in genesis
[53:48] i mean let's just read this in
[53:50] revelation hold your place here in
[53:51] genesis i want to read it
[53:52] because we're going to take our time
[53:54] we're going to study the bible
[53:57] revelation 13
[54:00] verse 11.
[54:06] and i beheld another beast coming up out
[54:08] of the earth
[54:09] brother branham said land where there's
[54:11] no people this is america
[54:12] amen every other nation came up out of
[54:14] europe amen before that
[54:15] out of the population but here was
[54:17] unpopulated area
[54:18] out of the earth he had two horns like a
[54:20] lamb a lamb is young he says this nation
[54:22] is still young
[54:24] and he spake as a dragon and he
[54:26] exercised all the power of the first
[54:27] beast before him
[54:28] and caused the earth and them that dwell
[54:30] therein to worship the first beast
[54:32] whose deadly wound was healed and he do
[54:35] with great wonders so that he maketh
[54:37] fire come down
[54:38] from heaven on the earth in the sight of
[54:40] men and deceiveth them that dwell on the
[54:42] earth by the means of those miracles
[54:43] which he had power
[54:45] to do in the sight of the beast saying
[54:46] unto them that dwell on the earth
[54:48] that they should make an image to the
[54:50] beast which had the wound by the sword
[54:52] and did
[54:53] live and he had power to give life into
[54:55] the image of the beast
[54:56] but the rest of the world counsel the
[54:57] churches that the image of the beast
[55:00] should both speak
[55:00] and cause the that as many as would not
[55:03] worship the image of the beast
[55:05] should be killed so here
[55:08] we have the two horns united and the
[55:11] uniting of the two horns
[55:12] is the uniting of the civil and
[55:13] ecclesiastical powers
[55:17] and all the way back in genesis 11
[55:20] you have a uniting of civil and
[55:22] ecclesiastical powers
[55:24] under whose administration nimrod's
[55:28] and what the tower of babylon
[55:31] now you see why this tower is so wicked
[55:35] it's so wicked for many reasons it's
[55:37] wicked because their whole plan to unify
[55:39] themselves was contrary to the word and
[55:41] the desire of god
[55:42] god didn't want them to unify themselves
[55:44] he didn't want him to build a name for
[55:45] themselves
[55:46] he wanted them to go out and replenish
[55:47] the earth
[55:49] and now they're defying the very
[55:50] commandments of god they're rebellious
[55:52] in nature rebellious to the word of god
[55:55] amen and they can never come into a
[55:57] relationship with god
[55:58] through this system this system will
[56:00] never bring them into a relationship
[56:02] with god because the system is defiant
[56:04] it's defying the very program of god in
[56:07] that day
[56:11] brother ben said in the message the
[56:13] oneness of unity
[56:15] he said and then in this great thing
[56:17] they had a man by the name of nimrod and
[56:19] nimrod was bringing all the rest of the
[56:20] cities
[56:21] and the nation under one great dominion
[56:23] showing that it's a man-made theory just
[56:25] a pattern
[56:26] but god's church is united under god man
[56:29] has nothing
[56:30] to do with it it's united under god and
[56:32] and this babylon which was the beginning
[56:34] in the creation in the genesis we find
[56:36] out
[56:36] that it's plumb over in revelation and
[56:39] it speaks of this ecclesiastical world
[56:41] in the last days which is now will
[56:43] finally unite under the antichrist
[56:46] a man-made religion
[56:50] 1959 super sign said it was nimrod one
[56:53] day who said that
[56:54] he'd built a tower that would bring his
[56:55] people he would show
[56:57] what he should he could achieve by his
[56:59] intelligence and he was to build a tower
[57:01] that would go beyond the clouds
[57:03] that if the wrath of god ever come he
[57:05] could outsmart him
[57:09] i want you to realize what nimrod was
[57:12] building was a religious system
[57:15] a religious order but it wasn't just a
[57:18] religious order it was a civil and
[57:19] religious order unified together
[57:22] amen it was a one world order amen it
[57:24] was a
[57:25] it was a government backing a religion a
[57:27] religion backing a government
[57:29] however you want to say it and he was
[57:33] going to
[57:34] uh uh that he would go beyond the clouds
[57:37] in this thing that if the wrath of god
[57:38] ever come he would outsmart
[57:40] him with his scientific research he
[57:42] could place the rocks and the stones in
[57:44] such a way
[57:45] that he could take the people to safety
[57:47] by his intelligence
[57:49] see this is the whole purpose of
[57:51] religion the whole purpose of religion
[57:53] is to make a protection for the people
[57:55] from the judgments of god
[57:58] because god wants to judge sin why does
[58:00] god want to judge sin because he wants
[58:02] to purge sin
[58:04] and he wants to bring us to an atonement
[58:05] to repentance to an atonement to restore
[58:08] fellowship
[58:08] but a religion is going to keep us from
[58:11] coming to the judgment of god
[58:12] and without coming to the judgment by
[58:14] the word we will never come to the
[58:16] atonement and we will never come back
[58:18] into fellowship
[58:20] and so religion is here to keep us from
[58:23] the judgment of god
[58:24] the religion is here to protect the
[58:27] people from
[58:28] god
[58:32] because you can sin all you want and go
[58:36] sit in a booth next to a priest and
[58:37] confess it to him and do some prayers on
[58:40] some beads
[58:40] and you are forgiven of your sin
[58:42] especially if you burn a candle and drop
[58:43] a few coins in
[58:45] now you're forgiven you don't need the
[58:46] word you don't need god
[58:48] you don't need the blood all you need is
[58:52] the church and the system of religion
[58:54] and the system of religion will free you
[58:56] from the judgment of god
[58:59] that's what nimrod set up amen nimrod
[59:02] said that system up
[59:04] this is the beginning amen through cain
[59:06] was the beginning of the catholic church
[59:08] now nimrod was perpetuating the catholic
[59:10] system
[59:12] you say it doesn't say catholic in the
[59:14] bible it's the same spirit
[59:16] amen it's the spirit that doesn't need a
[59:19] humble repentance to god
[59:20] it's a spirit that doesn't need god and
[59:23] a mercy of god begging god
[59:25] for and repent and say god forgive me
[59:27] for my sin
[59:28] wash me clean bring me through atonement
[59:30] restore me in fellowship
[59:32] you don't need any of that all you need
[59:34] is the system amen just come to church
[59:36] and pay your tithe and everything's fine
[59:38] with you
[59:39] you're a christian repeat after me shake
[59:42] my hand put your name on the book
[59:45] you're a christian
[59:51] that's nimrod system that's cain's
[59:53] system
[59:56] god's system is the word amen bringing
[59:58] us to an atonement
[1:00:04] now nimrod he wanted to
[1:00:08] a way that he could take the people to
[1:00:12] safety
[1:00:13] by his intelligence make a
[1:00:16] religious order by his own understanding
[1:00:19] his own intelligence
[1:00:20] that would be a place of safety for the
[1:00:22] people
[1:00:24] it was religious by nature
[1:00:27] it was religious in its overtones it had
[1:00:31] the appearance of being good
[1:00:33] but it was evil
[1:00:36] in this system it provides a false
[1:00:40] covering of false atonement
[1:00:42] a false unity a false protection
[1:00:47] from judgment
[1:00:50] see judgment was never a problem for the
[1:00:54] righteous seed
[1:00:57] if you think of noah in the day of
[1:00:59] judgment
[1:01:01] judgment was never a problem for the
[1:01:02] righteous seed because god
[1:01:04] always provided an atonement or a way
[1:01:08] through the judgment for the righteous
[1:01:09] seed
[1:01:11] so if you're the righteous seed of god
[1:01:13] you don't fear judgment
[1:01:15] because your father is using judgment to
[1:01:17] rid you from the influence of cain's
[1:01:19] line
[1:01:20] because there was a problem where the
[1:01:22] influence coming from cain was causing
[1:01:24] the daughters
[1:01:25] uh the sons of god to look on the
[1:01:26] daughters of men and begin to bring a
[1:01:28] hybridization a unifying of the two
[1:01:30] vines
[1:01:31] so god in his mercy would bring judgment
[1:01:34] his
[1:01:34] judgment was to free the people from the
[1:01:36] thing that was going to destroy them
[1:01:39] this is god's love when god brings a
[1:01:41] fiery word amen and he brings a judgment
[1:01:44] by that word
[1:01:45] he is not trying to destroy you he's
[1:01:47] trying to destroy the thing that's
[1:01:48] trying to destroy you
[1:01:51] but in the face of judgment he always by
[1:01:54] his word
[1:01:55] provides an ark amen a way to escape the
[1:01:58] judgment a way to pass through the
[1:01:59] judgment
[1:02:00] and be safe and be saved and be alive
[1:02:05] so for the righteous seed they don't
[1:02:07] fear the judgments of god
[1:02:09] amen because god always provides a way
[1:02:13] for his children
[1:02:15] so who fears the judgments of god those
[1:02:17] who are not the seed of god
[1:02:20] and because of their fear of the
[1:02:21] judgments of god they try to make their
[1:02:23] own way to protect themselves their own
[1:02:25] religion
[1:02:26] to protect them from the judgment of god
[1:02:29] that's what we see
[1:02:30] you know these statements i make they
[1:02:33] may
[1:02:34] seem a little bit harsh but if you
[1:02:35] really just let yourself look at the
[1:02:37] bible
[1:02:37] then look around at the world and the
[1:02:38] conditions it's in you realize
[1:02:41] cain's objective was to protect the
[1:02:43] people from another flood
[1:02:46] and the flood was the righteous judgment
[1:02:48] of a righteous god
[1:02:51] and he was trying to keep the people
[1:02:53] from judgment
[1:02:54] and he was trying to bring the unified
[1:02:56] the people make a name for themselves
[1:02:57] defying the very commandment of god
[1:03:00] and then define the commandment of god
[1:03:02] they all felt safe because they were
[1:03:03] working on a tower
[1:03:04] that would get them beyond the judgment
[1:03:06] of god so that they could go into the
[1:03:08] tower
[1:03:08] and sing with the angels and let the
[1:03:10] judgment pass and then they could come
[1:03:11] back down and live any way they want to
[1:03:13] live
[1:03:13] so that you could go out on friday night
[1:03:15] and be so drunk that you can't find your
[1:03:17] way home on saturday but as long as you
[1:03:18] go to a confession and take a mass
[1:03:20] amen and have a wafer stuck in your
[1:03:22] mouth then you're fine
[1:03:25] that system started in revel in genesis
[1:03:29] and continues on the day
[1:03:31] and it didn't stop at the catholics it
[1:03:32] moved to the baptist it moved to the
[1:03:34] methodist the wesley amen all the way
[1:03:36] down through to the pentecostals
[1:03:38] and it's the same religious spirit that
[1:03:40] is trying to get to the bride amen
[1:03:42] but there's a bridegroom here says not
[1:03:44] i'm going to unveil that thing so that
[1:03:46] that system won't get to my bride
[1:03:49] it's not the strength the wisdom the
[1:03:51] power of the bride the bride is just as
[1:03:53] helpless as anybody else in the bible
[1:03:54] has ever been helpless amen
[1:03:56] but it's the presence of the bridegroom
[1:03:58] that is here to say
[1:03:59] we are not going to have that system she
[1:04:01] is not going to fall
[1:04:03] she's predestinated not to fall amen and
[1:04:05] you know when god saw that he was going
[1:04:07] to predestinate that this bride was not
[1:04:09] going to fail by that
[1:04:10] same religious system
[1:04:17] at that same time he knew there would be
[1:04:20] a malachi 4 prophet come on
[1:04:24] because that bride is not strong enough
[1:04:27] in herself to resist that system
[1:04:31] those people are not wise enough and
[1:04:33] taught well enough and
[1:04:35] well enough versed in the bible to stop
[1:04:37] that system
[1:04:39] see when god looked down and he foresaw
[1:04:41] that he would have a bride at the end
[1:04:43] time
[1:04:43] without spot or wrinkle amen that there
[1:04:45] was going to be a perfect bride that was
[1:04:47] going to unite with a perfect bridegroom
[1:04:48] he didn't re he didn't make that
[1:04:51] declaration because he looked down and
[1:04:52] saw you and say you were fit for the job
[1:04:54] and you'll be able to do it
[1:04:57] he looked at you and you were just like
[1:04:59] every one of his poor children that was
[1:05:01] sown into corruption and stuck into
[1:05:02] hybridization
[1:05:03] and you would fail the same as everybody
[1:05:05] else would fail but he had a plan in
[1:05:07] this day
[1:05:08] because he was going to open the seals
[1:05:09] in this day so that he was going to
[1:05:11] expose the tactics of the devil and he
[1:05:13] was going to unwind the trail of the
[1:05:15] serpent and the two vine
[1:05:16] so you could see what's happened all the
[1:05:18] way back and avoid the very same thing
[1:05:20] today
[1:05:22] you know what the devils those devils
[1:05:25] amen that were anointing nimrod and all
[1:05:27] those people are alive today
[1:05:30] i mean those devils i mean that satan
[1:05:32] the titanic spirit that was moving in
[1:05:34] cain
[1:05:35] is moving today the satanic spirits that
[1:05:37] were moving the people to build the
[1:05:39] tower of babel
[1:05:40] are moving today and we know that in
[1:05:43] this day
[1:05:44] amen two hundred thousand thousand
[1:05:46] demons were unleashed out of the river
[1:05:48] euphrates and he said going for what
[1:05:50] going after the denomination no after
[1:05:52] the bride
[1:05:53] now there's special reserved demons that
[1:05:55] have been reserved for the end time
[1:05:57] that are now unleashed and they're
[1:05:59] targeting who
[1:06:01] the bride what kind of demons
[1:06:05] religious demons
[1:06:12] how are we going to stand all those same
[1:06:15] spirits that had always caused failure
[1:06:19] in the past that have always tripped up
[1:06:21] god's children in the past
[1:06:23] how are we going to resist all them and
[1:06:25] 200 000
[1:06:26] 000 that's been unleashed in the end
[1:06:28] time
[1:06:30] i'll tell you how christ himself would
[1:06:32] come
[1:06:33] he wouldn't leave it to anybody else he
[1:06:35] wouldn't leave it to another
[1:06:37] another dispensation another church age
[1:06:39] on the strength of the people
[1:06:40] but he would come down himself amen and
[1:06:42] when he come down himself it would be
[1:06:44] the unveiling of god
[1:06:46] and the unveiling of god would unveil
[1:06:48] the serpent seed amen
[1:06:49] and the serpent's tactics and the trail
[1:06:51] of the serpent amen and he himself would
[1:06:53] be here in this day
[1:06:54] and say look at this and look at that
[1:06:56] watch out for that and don't go over
[1:06:57] there
[1:06:59] it's the evidence that the bridegroom is
[1:07:01] here friends
[1:07:02] he's here protecting his little bride
[1:07:04] from those religious demons that are
[1:07:05] circling all around you you know what
[1:07:08] those spirits want to do
[1:07:09] they want you to be satisfied believing
[1:07:12] in malachi 4 that god sent a prophet
[1:07:14] dressing holy and going to church and
[1:07:16] paying tithes and settle down and make
[1:07:18] that your tower of protection against
[1:07:20] the judgment
[1:07:22] all of those demons want to take the
[1:07:24] message and make it a religion
[1:07:28] and they want you to accept the religion
[1:07:30] or the message
[1:07:31] but the message is not a religion the
[1:07:33] message is not doctrines the messages
[1:07:35] and the teaching
[1:07:36] the message is the bridegroom amen and
[1:07:38] he's here today to unite with the bride
[1:07:40] and he's dwelling in his
[1:07:42] bride protecting her from those demons
[1:07:44] it's the mind of christ
[1:07:46] it's the revealing of the word of god
[1:07:48] it's not you it's not me it's him
[1:07:52] praise be to god he's ensuring in this
[1:07:55] day she's not going to fall by those
[1:07:56] same spirits
[1:07:58] but don't you think those demons aren't
[1:08:00] all around you
[1:08:03] circling waiting for an opportunity
[1:08:09] but god is going to be sure this day
[1:08:12] this day he's going to have a bride
[1:08:14] without spartan vehicle
[1:08:16] how's he going to do it he's going to
[1:08:18] come down and dwell in her
[1:08:20] to ensure it and she's going to have the
[1:08:22] mind of christ she's going to have the
[1:08:23] word
[1:08:24] it's going to be fullness of his spirit
[1:08:25] back in the church again
[1:08:27] and he's going to take every obstacle
[1:08:29] that's out there and bring it right back
[1:08:30] to the word and say
[1:08:31] look here look here look here remember
[1:08:33] what the prophet said
[1:08:34] remember what i showed the opening seals
[1:08:35] here it is in genesis 11. here it is in
[1:08:37] genesis here
[1:08:38] here it is who's doing that
[1:08:42] not a preacher amen the bridegroom is
[1:08:44] doing that for his bride
[1:08:46] saying watch that tactic watch this
[1:08:48] tactic watch that trap
[1:08:52] he's here to make sure that she doesn't
[1:08:55] fail like the ones before
[1:08:58] because she's predestinated not to
[1:09:02] if you ever start getting the idea that
[1:09:05] i'm secure
[1:09:06] just because i'm bride and i go to a
[1:09:08] message church you're in
[1:09:10] super dangerous realm right there you're
[1:09:12] just about on the edge of collapse
[1:09:16] because anybody can take to themselves
[1:09:18] the title of bride
[1:09:19] and anybody can come along and be
[1:09:21] convinced to believe a certain set of
[1:09:23] things and
[1:09:24] cooperate with a group of people amen
[1:09:27] and then begin to believe that they're
[1:09:28] justified
[1:09:30] and secure in that and now
[1:09:34] these little compromises that i have in
[1:09:36] my life
[1:09:38] and these little anti-word things that
[1:09:39] are all around it's okay because i'm the
[1:09:41] bride
[1:09:45] that's those demons working
[1:09:48] that is what those demons are trying to
[1:09:50] produce
[1:09:53] where we can have men who are double
[1:09:55] married and have
[1:09:56] women who are divorced and remarried and
[1:09:58] have all kinds of things that are going
[1:09:59] on in the message
[1:10:00] but it's okay because i believe malachi
[1:10:02] 4 and i'm the bride and i'm in the
[1:10:03] message
[1:10:04] when the prophet who brought the message
[1:10:06] said that's wrong
[1:10:08] the prophet who would stand on the
[1:10:10] pulpit preaching flashing red light of
[1:10:12] his coming and talk about
[1:10:13] tight clothes and short dresses and
[1:10:15] makeup and high heels and excessive
[1:10:17] jewelry
[1:10:17] and it can walk right into a messy
[1:10:19] church and sit down every sunday say i'm
[1:10:21] filled with the holy ghost i'm bright of
[1:10:23] jesus christ
[1:10:24] what produces that the same demons that
[1:10:27] built this tower
[1:10:30] feeling secure and safe
[1:10:33] in a form of religion
[1:10:36] not in a relationship with the
[1:10:39] bridegroom
[1:10:40] because the relationship with the
[1:10:42] bridegroom takes the word it says
[1:10:44] look here look here
[1:10:48] look here look here and the elect says
[1:10:51] amen amen that's how you want me to
[1:10:55] dress
[1:10:56] amen that's how you want me to act amen
[1:10:59] this is how you want me to worship amen
[1:11:05] but when we throw those things off and
[1:11:06] do whatever we want because we're bride
[1:11:10] that's the influence of those demons
[1:11:13] [Music]
[1:11:16] and don't think they're not all around
[1:11:18] you
[1:11:20] brother better say where did those 200
[1:11:22] thousand thousand demons go after the
[1:11:23] denomination
[1:11:24] know the bride
[1:11:28] so why are you under so much pressure
[1:11:32] but don't worry the bridegroom's here
[1:11:35] all is well
[1:11:37] my bridegroom is here
[1:11:42] he goes on and says in jehovah jireh
[1:11:44] 1961
[1:11:46] the beginning of abraham he'd come down
[1:11:48] from babylon from shinar and dwelt in
[1:11:50] the valleys and
[1:11:51] we know all about babylon how that
[1:11:53] nimrod was the first one to try to make
[1:11:55] an organization
[1:11:56] he organized a great religious move and
[1:11:58] made all these little churches pay
[1:12:00] tribute to him
[1:12:00] to this big city of babylon built a
[1:12:03] tower there that went up into the
[1:12:04] heavens and so forth
[1:12:05] he thought with his own thoughts he
[1:12:08] thought that he could do
[1:12:09] something that would save the people
[1:12:13] praise god you see there's nothing that
[1:12:16] you can do to save yourself
[1:12:21] keeping a religious order will never
[1:12:23] save you
[1:12:26] i said before the message has an order
[1:12:29] to it because everything in god has an
[1:12:31] order to it god has an order to worship
[1:12:33] god has an order
[1:12:34] everything and god's system has an order
[1:12:36] to it so there's a certain
[1:12:37] order to worship amen but but when we
[1:12:40] when we look at the order and the
[1:12:42] keeping of the order of security
[1:12:45] then we're on dangerous grounds
[1:12:49] you cannot save yourself there's not
[1:12:52] one thing you've got to solemnly trust
[1:12:55] on the grace of god to do it
[1:12:58] you can't save yourself i don't care how
[1:13:00] religious you are
[1:13:01] how good you try to be and keep all the
[1:13:03] commandments and everything
[1:13:04] that won't do one thing
[1:13:08] it's the grace of god amen
[1:13:16] so now they've come in and in genesis
[1:13:18] chapter 11
[1:13:20] they come to the said
[1:13:24] let us build a city and a tower let's
[1:13:26] bake bricks and
[1:13:28] they took bricks and had slime for
[1:13:30] mortar and they built them a city
[1:13:32] and the tower whose top may reach into
[1:13:35] heaven
[1:13:36] let us make a name lest we be scattered
[1:13:38] abroad upon the face
[1:13:40] of the whole earth they're absolutely
[1:13:43] defying god's word
[1:13:49] and the lord god came down to see the
[1:13:51] city
[1:13:52] and the tower which the children and men
[1:13:54] build in and the lord said behold
[1:13:58] the people is one and they have all one
[1:14:00] language
[1:14:02] and this they begin to do and now
[1:14:03] nothing will be restrained from them
[1:14:06] which they have imagined to do go to let
[1:14:09] us go down there and confound their
[1:14:10] language
[1:14:11] they may not understand one another's
[1:14:13] speech so the lord scattered them abroad
[1:14:16] from thence upon the face of all the
[1:14:18] earth and they left off to build the
[1:14:20] city
[1:14:21] therefore is the name of it called babel
[1:14:23] because the lord did
[1:14:24] there confound the language of all the
[1:14:26] earth and from thence did the lord
[1:14:28] scatter them abroad upon the face
[1:14:30] of all the earth that was his intent
[1:14:34] from the beginning so god the very thing
[1:14:38] they were
[1:14:38] trying to protect themselves against is
[1:14:41] the very thing that came
[1:14:43] because you can't stop the word of god
[1:14:46] so god come and confounded their
[1:14:48] language so that they could not
[1:14:49] understand one another and he scattered
[1:14:51] them abroad upon the face of the earth
[1:14:52] which was his original
[1:14:54] intention when they came out of the ark
[1:14:57] but god had it anyway
[1:14:58] and what was this judgment this judgment
[1:15:01] was the protection of his seed
[1:15:04] because they were all binding themselves
[1:15:05] to this they were all coming into this
[1:15:07] order
[1:15:07] and nimrod listen nimrod was not just
[1:15:10] passively bringing them under this order
[1:15:13] he was through conquering conquest and
[1:15:15] war was bringing the world to this
[1:15:16] religious order
[1:15:18] he was a mighty man he was a mighty
[1:15:20] hunter before the lord
[1:15:21] he was a man of war he was a man of
[1:15:24] strength amen and brother bam talks
[1:15:25] about this in the church age book
[1:15:27] but he wasn't just saying you know
[1:15:29] anybody who wants you can come if you
[1:15:30] don't want to it's fine
[1:15:31] he was by conquering conquest he was
[1:15:34] forcing a religious unity
[1:15:38] so god because it wasn't time yet
[1:15:42] it wasn't time yet there'll be a time
[1:15:45] for that
[1:15:46] the time is at the door now for this
[1:15:49] religious unity of a one-world system
[1:15:51] uniting civil
[1:15:52] and ecclesiastical powers together and
[1:15:55] forcing a religious order that will
[1:15:56] bring all the world under its heading
[1:15:58] that day is here friends but it wasn't
[1:16:01] then
[1:16:02] and so god still had some work to do he
[1:16:04] still has some redeeming to do he still
[1:16:05] had some
[1:16:06] uh uh some manifesting of himself of his
[1:16:08] word to do he came down and he stopped
[1:16:10] it amen
[1:16:11] what was that that was god's mercy that
[1:16:13] was god's grace that was god working his
[1:16:15] plan
[1:16:16] and he come down and he stopped and he
[1:16:17] confused their languages and he
[1:16:20] scattered them abroad
[1:16:22] over the face of the earth
[1:16:26] and then god's children the elect of god
[1:16:30] would be scattered
[1:16:31] here and scattered there and god could
[1:16:33] speak to them individually
[1:16:36] which is what he wanted from the
[1:16:38] beginning
[1:16:40] not in the group god didn't want the
[1:16:42] group
[1:16:44] god was against the group from the
[1:16:46] beginning
[1:16:48] from the very beginning in genesis god
[1:16:50] was against systematic religion
[1:16:53] and he was against formal religion and
[1:16:55] he was against
[1:16:56] group mentality from day one
[1:16:59] he was against it
[1:17:03] so now he scatters them abroad
[1:17:07] and he says brother ben says in 1956 the
[1:17:09] junction of time
[1:17:11] says notice during that time there was a
[1:17:13] man by the name of nimrod who went out
[1:17:15] and built the big city
[1:17:16] of babylon and confederated all the
[1:17:17] rounding cities
[1:17:19] that they'd all confederate together and
[1:17:21] they'd be one big city and that would be
[1:17:23] babylon
[1:17:24] and how that god despised that
[1:17:26] federation of world order
[1:17:28] god despised it but god's going to allow
[1:17:32] it
[1:17:34] because he's finally going to bring them
[1:17:36] to the final judgment
[1:17:42] now let's go back to genesis chapter 9.
[1:17:44] i want to look at something we skipped
[1:17:46] over
[1:17:56] now i want to end with this thought
[1:18:00] out of genesis 9. now remember
[1:18:03] what brother ben told us and what we see
[1:18:06] in the tower
[1:18:07] they wanted to bend themselves together
[1:18:11] and make a name for themselves unless
[1:18:13] they be scattered
[1:18:15] so they wanted to unify themselves and
[1:18:17] they wanted the power that come from
[1:18:19] unity
[1:18:23] it can still be a false notion today
[1:18:26] even amongst ourselves that there's
[1:18:29] power and unity of individuals
[1:18:34] that's a false concept of the carnal
[1:18:36] mind
[1:18:38] your power is your unity with the word
[1:18:41] of god
[1:18:42] your power is unity with the life of god
[1:18:44] your power is unity with god
[1:18:46] one man totally surrendered to god
[1:18:50] can change the whole world is that what
[1:18:52] he said
[1:18:54] god doesn't need many he needs one one
[1:18:56] totally surrendered and in the hand of
[1:18:57] god
[1:18:58] it can change the whole world amen when
[1:19:00] paul and barnabas went into a city they
[1:19:02] said these be the men
[1:19:03] that turned the whole world upside down
[1:19:05] there was two of them
[1:19:08] god doesn't need the unification of
[1:19:10] forces amen and in a carnality we can
[1:19:12] bring this into religious realms and
[1:19:14] think the more people we can get
[1:19:15] together and the more agreement we have
[1:19:17] amongst ourselves and the more
[1:19:18] we say the same thing and believe the
[1:19:20] same thing and do the same thing the
[1:19:21] more
[1:19:22] power we have that does not equal power
[1:19:25] many times that brings the deception
[1:19:29] that is the playground for these
[1:19:30] religious spirits where they begin to
[1:19:32] sway groups and move
[1:19:33] groups amen because they can take one or
[1:19:36] two or three
[1:19:37] and bring them to the head of a vast
[1:19:38] number and move them what god wants is
[1:19:40] the power that comes from an individual
[1:19:42] united with christ amen where the two
[1:19:44] have become one
[1:19:46] that's power that's all the power that
[1:19:48] this bride needs
[1:19:52] and everyone individually connected to
[1:19:55] the head
[1:19:56] brings a unity
[1:20:00] but it's not a lateral cross unity
[1:20:04] it's a vertical unity
[1:20:08] with christ jesus an individual
[1:20:10] connected to christ
[1:20:12] and if you're an individual connected to
[1:20:13] christ then we are bond with an
[1:20:15] inseparable bond of fellowship
[1:20:19] but all of us bonding ourselves together
[1:20:21] in fellowship
[1:20:22] does not equal a connection to christ
[1:20:27] and no matter how many of us you get
[1:20:29] bound together
[1:20:30] and how much agreement that we have
[1:20:32] together if there's not a bind
[1:20:34] individually to christ amen it becomes a
[1:20:38] deception it becomes a trap
[1:20:40] amen and it has the negative effect on
[1:20:42] the believers not a positive effect
[1:20:49] this is the devil's tactics
[1:20:52] the seals are open the traditional veil
[1:20:55] has been rent
[1:20:57] christ is in plain view the antichrist
[1:20:59] has been exposed
[1:21:00] what's the devil howling about that is
[1:21:03] being revealed
[1:21:05] what's the devil what's he howling about
[1:21:07] that is the individual
[1:21:09] one man the word in her alone one person
[1:21:12] one individual not the group
[1:21:13] what's the devil howling about this is
[1:21:15] what the devil is howling about
[1:21:17] he wants religion god wants one
[1:21:20] god wants you the devil wants religion
[1:21:24] and when brother branham was coming and
[1:21:25] breaking up the denominations and
[1:21:27] busting up the religious idea
[1:21:28] he wasn't just breaking up denominations
[1:21:30] that i'm a denomination
[1:21:32] he's breaking up the mentality the
[1:21:34] spirit that created the denomination
[1:21:38] the spirit that was on nimrod the spirit
[1:21:39] that was on cain the spirit was on
[1:21:41] nebuchadnezzar the spirit that was on
[1:21:42] rome
[1:21:44] when brother ben became when god was
[1:21:46] ministering through that prophet he
[1:21:47] didn't come to bust
[1:21:48] the nominations and say well we broke up
[1:21:51] the baptist we broke up the mess
[1:21:52] he is breaking up that spirit amen that
[1:21:56] created the denominations to begin with
[1:22:00] and this is what the devil is howling
[1:22:02] about friends
[1:22:03] this is what he's so angry about this is
[1:22:06] what he wants to shut down and stop
[1:22:11] the power of true unity you as an
[1:22:14] individual united with christ
[1:22:15] that's the power of true unity and if
[1:22:18] christ before you
[1:22:19] who can be against you i am persuaded
[1:22:20] neither life nor death nor
[1:22:22] nor anything shall separate me from the
[1:22:24] love of god
[1:22:27] that's the power of unity the other
[1:22:31] is a knockoff it's a false unity that
[1:22:33] brings deception
[1:22:34] and weakens the bride
[1:22:40] i'm not saying don't come to church we
[1:22:43] have a commandment for that too
[1:22:45] but let the true unity prevail don't get
[1:22:49] stuck in the false
[1:22:51] be unified with christ
[1:22:55] now i want to i want to share this last
[1:22:57] thought and then we'll close for tonight
[1:23:00] genesis chapter 9 verse 8.
[1:23:06] and god spake unto noah unto his sons
[1:23:09] with him saying
[1:23:10] and i beheld and i behold
[1:23:14] i establish my covenant with you and
[1:23:17] with your seed after you
[1:23:18] and with every living creature that is
[1:23:20] with you of the fowl of the cat
[1:23:22] of the fowl and of the cattle and of
[1:23:24] every beast of the earth with you from
[1:23:26] all that go out of the ark
[1:23:27] to every beast of the earth and i will
[1:23:30] establish my covenant with you neither
[1:23:32] shall all flesh be cut off any more by
[1:23:34] the waters
[1:23:35] of a flood neither shall there any more
[1:23:37] be a flood
[1:23:39] to destroy the earth and god said
[1:23:42] this is the token of the covenant which
[1:23:46] i make between me
[1:23:47] and you and every living creature that
[1:23:49] is with you
[1:23:50] for perpetual generations
[1:23:53] i do set my bow in the cloud and it
[1:23:55] shall be for a token of a covenant
[1:23:57] between me and the earth and it shall
[1:24:00] come to pass when i bring a cloud over
[1:24:02] the earth that the vote shall be seen in
[1:24:04] the cloud and i will remember my
[1:24:06] covenant which is between me
[1:24:07] and you and every living creature of all
[1:24:09] flesh and the water shall no more become
[1:24:12] a flood to destroy all the flesh
[1:24:14] and the bow shall be in the cloud and i
[1:24:16] will
[1:24:17] look upon it that i may remember the
[1:24:20] everlasting covenant between god
[1:24:22] and every living creature of all flesh
[1:24:24] that is upon the earth
[1:24:26] and god said unto noah this is the token
[1:24:29] of the covenant which
[1:24:30] i have established between me and all
[1:24:32] flesh that is upon the earth
[1:24:38] the powerful thing in this scripture
[1:24:43] is that nimrod convinced the people
[1:24:46] that they needed to ban themselves
[1:24:47] together and protect themselves against
[1:24:50] the judgment of god and build a tower
[1:24:52] that if god would bring floods upon the
[1:24:54] earth again they could go up into the
[1:24:55] tower
[1:24:56] and when the floods pass they could come
[1:24:58] back down
[1:24:59] and they were ignoring the very promise
[1:25:02] of god that said i will not
[1:25:04] ever destroy the earth with the flood
[1:25:06] again
[1:25:08] it's another anti-chr anti-christ move
[1:25:11] amen
[1:25:12] god himself promised he said i will
[1:25:15] never destroy the earth this is to you
[1:25:17] and to perpetual generations and to
[1:25:19] everything that has breath and every
[1:25:21] living thing in flesh upon the face of
[1:25:23] the earth i will
[1:25:24] never bring the floods of water destroy
[1:25:26] everything on the earth again
[1:25:28] and for a sign for a token i will put a
[1:25:31] rainbow in the sky
[1:25:32] and every time i bring a cloud the
[1:25:34] rainbow shall be seen in the cloud
[1:25:36] as a covenant as a token between the
[1:25:39] covenant of you and i
[1:25:43] and nimrod's actions proved that they
[1:25:46] did not believe
[1:25:47] god would keep his word
[1:25:50] this is what is so detrimental to
[1:25:53] religion amen a religious system that's
[1:25:55] trying to protect people
[1:25:57] has absolutely no faith in the word of
[1:25:59] god
[1:26:00] because god said that token is a
[1:26:02] covenant it's a sign
[1:26:03] of a covenant between me and you and i
[1:26:06] made a promise and he didn't base
[1:26:08] it off any of their conduct the promise
[1:26:10] lay totally
[1:26:11] in his word and the strength of his
[1:26:15] character
[1:26:15] and the strength of him being god who
[1:26:17] would keep his word and he said i will
[1:26:19] not destroy the earth with the flood
[1:26:21] again
[1:26:21] and nimrod comes and convinces the
[1:26:23] people to mistrust
[1:26:25] god this is a trust issue
[1:26:32] he convinced the people that you cannot
[1:26:35] trust
[1:26:36] the word of god
[1:26:39] you cannot trust grace
[1:26:42] alone
[1:26:46] you cannot trust the word of god
[1:26:50] we have to do something ourselves
[1:26:56] see the seeds of all religion
[1:27:01] god was good to his word and he has been
[1:27:03] good to his word ever since
[1:27:05] for thousands of years god has put the
[1:27:07] rainbow there
[1:27:08] as a token he's been faithful to display
[1:27:10] and proving that he's a man of
[1:27:12] he's not like a man that should lie he's
[1:27:14] a god that keeps his word
[1:27:17] and god has been faithful to that word
[1:27:19] but nimrod
[1:27:20] brings them together amen they bring
[1:27:22] them together in a
[1:27:24] mistrust of the word of god and that the
[1:27:27] word of god is not enough
[1:27:28] and we can't trust god's word alone
[1:27:32] we have to protect ourselves in case the
[1:27:35] word doesn't hold
[1:27:38] in case god is not faithful to his
[1:27:40] promise
[1:27:43] oh my goodness friends that's religion
[1:27:46] friends
[1:27:47] any time that the devil tries to get you
[1:27:49] through some religious action to protect
[1:27:51] yourself or to prove something
[1:27:52] or to guard yourself you don't need to
[1:27:54] protect yourself or guard yourself
[1:27:56] you're under the promises of god
[1:27:58] he's promised that nothing will happen
[1:28:00] to you that hasn't first crossed his
[1:28:01] desk
[1:28:02] there's nothing that will harm you
[1:28:03] there's nothing that will come against
[1:28:05] you
[1:28:06] we don't need anything but the but the
[1:28:09] trust that god will keep his word
[1:28:11] if he said it it's true it's forever
[1:28:14] true i don't need to do anything to
[1:28:15] protect myself
[1:28:16] he is my protection i don't need to
[1:28:19] become anxious for tomorrow
[1:28:20] i don't need to be well i don't need to
[1:28:21] become anxious for retirement i don't
[1:28:23] need to be worried about my family
[1:28:25] i don't need to become nervous and
[1:28:27] anxious and upset because god always
[1:28:29] said
[1:28:29] if you look at the lilies amen
[1:28:34] this was jesus christ god in flesh he
[1:28:37] said consider the lilies
[1:28:39] they neither toil or spin but solomon in
[1:28:42] all his glory was not erased such as one
[1:28:43] of these
[1:28:45] don't think what what you'll wear your
[1:28:48] raymond or tomorrow what we'll put on
[1:28:50] god knows that you have need of these
[1:28:52] things look at the sparrow
[1:28:56] listen the question is is he still
[1:28:59] faithful to his word
[1:29:00] was that the word of god and is it still
[1:29:02] true today
[1:29:03] or do we have to do something to protect
[1:29:05] ourselves and provide for ourselves
[1:29:09] old religious demons
[1:29:14] creeping in you've got to do something
[1:29:18] you've got to guard you've got to prove
[1:29:21] your faith
[1:29:26] oh praise god devils are dropping amen
[1:29:31] the veil is torn off friends the
[1:29:34] traditional veil
[1:29:35] has been ripped wide open amen god is
[1:29:38] here himself
[1:29:38] trying to keep us free from those things
[1:29:45] convince the whole world
[1:29:48] to put all their labor and resources in
[1:29:50] time
[1:29:51] to build a useless religion
[1:29:55] that tower was a useless religion
[1:30:00] it would do nothing because the rainbow
[1:30:03] was the evidence that this tower would
[1:30:05] never be needed
[1:30:07] and god has sent us a token in this day
[1:30:09] and the token is his own life
[1:30:11] in you and that's all the evidence that
[1:30:13] you need that everything is fine
[1:30:15] you don't need anything else you don't
[1:30:16] need to prove anything you don't need
[1:30:18] any other security
[1:30:19] all you need is that life living in you
[1:30:22] you need to be quickened by the baptism
[1:30:23] of holy ghost which is the token today
[1:30:25] his life in the individual is the sign
[1:30:29] is the token is the proof of the
[1:30:32] covenant
[1:30:34] you don't have to be tricked into doing
[1:30:36] something else or proving something else
[1:30:38] or manifesting something else
[1:30:41] the token the life of christ that he's
[1:30:44] given
[1:30:45] out to his bride today the union that
[1:30:47] he's come into with you as an individual
[1:30:49] the token life the baptism of the holy
[1:30:51] ghost is the token
[1:30:55] that his covenant with you is good
[1:31:00] and he won't fail to keep his word
[1:31:04] and if the if the devil can come along
[1:31:06] and try to trick us into putting our
[1:31:08] efforts and our time
[1:31:09] and our labor and our energy into some
[1:31:11] religious work that'll be some sort of
[1:31:13] protection or proof or vindication or
[1:31:15] evidence the token is the evidence
[1:31:17] the token is the sign the token is the
[1:31:20] only thing you need
[1:31:22] amen when they're building this tower
[1:31:23] friends you realize
[1:31:25] they're baking brick they're all working
[1:31:27] thousands of people maybe tens of
[1:31:29] thousands maybe hundreds of thousands i
[1:31:30] don't know how many people
[1:31:32] are laboring with bricks and mortar and
[1:31:34] building and it's going higher
[1:31:36] and they're all working together in
[1:31:37] unity and harmony and every time a rain
[1:31:39] cloud comes by
[1:31:40] there's an evidence that there that god
[1:31:42] won't fail his word and everything
[1:31:44] you're doing is wasted effort it's in
[1:31:45] vain
[1:31:46] and won't help you a bit
[1:31:49] and all it will do is keep you from
[1:31:51] faith in the token
[1:31:59] and in this day god sent a cloud again
[1:32:03] and in the cloud was a token
[1:32:07] the life of jesus christ there was a
[1:32:10] rainbow in the cloud
[1:32:12] and that cloud is in evidence that he
[1:32:15] keeps his covenants
[1:32:19] it's not you prophet of god says it's
[1:32:22] not what i did
[1:32:24] i wasn't the one who opened the blind i
[1:32:26] was the one who did those things
[1:32:27] i was just standing there when he did
[1:32:29] those things
[1:32:31] it's not a religious work or a religious
[1:32:33] order or keeping of a certain
[1:32:35] code of conduct or rules or order of a
[1:32:37] church amen
[1:32:38] it's a yielding to him and letting him
[1:32:40] do through you
[1:32:42] all the works that he's ordained for you
[1:32:44] to do
[1:32:46] none of those things are your token
[1:32:52] the sign of the covenant the token
[1:32:56] is his life in you and his life in you
[1:33:01] when you surrender to him becomes a
[1:33:03] token on display
[1:33:06] by you manifesting the word for your day
[1:33:10] it's not a work that you do it's a work
[1:33:12] that he comes in and does through you
[1:33:17] the whole effort of the tower of babel
[1:33:23] was evidence they did not trust god
[1:33:27] and they did not believe his word
[1:33:30] and the whole religious order of the day
[1:33:32] is evidence that they do not trust god
[1:33:36] and they do not believe his word
[1:33:39] it doesn't matter how many bible verses
[1:33:41] they quote
[1:33:42] it doesn't matter how many works that
[1:33:44] are done verses that are quoted
[1:33:47] and efforts that are made it's all in
[1:33:49] vain
[1:33:50] because the token is proof of the
[1:33:52] covenant
[1:33:53] and god will keep his word
[1:33:57] in the message god's provided way
[1:34:00] it says now man has tried to achieve
[1:34:02] through all along
[1:34:03] we think of nimrod when he thinks of one
[1:34:05] time that god destroyed the world with
[1:34:06] water this great prince of babylon
[1:34:10] he said i can get by that see he's
[1:34:11] trying to find something
[1:34:13] it's his nature man does them he proved
[1:34:16] his nature when adam taking his bite
[1:34:18] from the tree of knowledge separated
[1:34:20] himself from god he tried to make
[1:34:21] himself a way back to god by covering
[1:34:23] himself with fig leaves
[1:34:25] a religion making himself he was trying
[1:34:27] to make salvation without an atonement
[1:34:31] and we find that man's still doing the
[1:34:34] same thing today
[1:34:35] joining church putting his name on a
[1:34:37] book trying to find a way of
[1:34:39] uh saying a few prayers a certain way or
[1:34:41] repeating a couple of creeds trying to
[1:34:43] find salvation
[1:34:44] without atonement you cannot you've got
[1:34:47] to have
[1:34:48] an atonement for sin and sin is unbelief
[1:34:50] and there's no other sin but unbelief
[1:34:53] i've often said that drinking committing
[1:34:55] adultery and swearing is not sin that's
[1:34:57] the attributes of sin
[1:34:58] you're an unbeliever the reason you do
[1:35:00] it but if you did believe god you would
[1:35:02] not do that see
[1:35:03] you could not do it if you're a believer
[1:35:05] now we find then
[1:35:07] that man has separated himself from god
[1:35:09] and always trying to use that same tree
[1:35:11] of knowledge to get back by
[1:35:12] and take himself farther away all the
[1:35:14] time therefore we find nimrod
[1:35:17] immediately afterwards tried to build
[1:35:19] him a tower
[1:35:19] a religious tower that if god did
[1:35:22] destroy the world again
[1:35:23] what would he do he would climb up and
[1:35:25] take his people and go up above the
[1:35:27] flood
[1:35:28] of the tower and he'd get above it what
[1:35:30] did they come what become of it
[1:35:32] all of his achievement make himself a
[1:35:34] great name he perished
[1:35:36] with his tower
[1:35:42] brother braham said in oneness he said a
[1:35:44] false union
[1:35:45] brought judgment on the earth
[1:35:49] to even adam and eden in a false union
[1:35:51] brought the floods of god's judgment
[1:35:53] on the earth because the daughters of
[1:35:54] cain flirted with the sons of god and
[1:35:56] they fell for it and united together
[1:35:57] again
[1:35:58] there you are a false union nothing
[1:36:00] could happen what did god do
[1:36:02] he destroyed the whole thing all but
[1:36:03] precious old noah in his family
[1:36:05] and again after that after the death of
[1:36:07] noah that spiritual family and know the
[1:36:09] first thing you know the
[1:36:10] children of man began to look to one
[1:36:12] another again what did they do
[1:36:13] they said now we're not infidels we all
[1:36:15] believe in god so they got a fellow by a
[1:36:17] leader some
[1:36:18] some great archbishop by the name of
[1:36:20] nimrod and they built a tower
[1:36:21] they wasn't infidels they believed there
[1:36:23] was a heaven they believed there was a
[1:36:25] hell
[1:36:26] they believed in judgments but the
[1:36:27] children of god were the daughters of
[1:36:29] men again and they made themselves a
[1:36:30] union falsely
[1:36:31] and built a great big cathedral a great
[1:36:33] big organization
[1:36:35] and the all the other places babel was
[1:36:37] to pay tribute to it
[1:36:39] he's building the same thing now and
[1:36:41] he'll bring it by a false
[1:36:43] union watch the unions
[1:36:48] don't be united with anything but christ
[1:36:52] and he is the word
[1:37:01] and god hiding himself in simplicity sin
[1:37:04] and that's what we ought to do today
[1:37:05] friend
[1:37:06] we got to take the whole word of god
[1:37:08] because we're going to need it we got to
[1:37:09] use every word that's in there
[1:37:11] it's thus saith the lord and we've got
[1:37:12] to use the full gospel all of it
[1:37:14] now when god had fortified his church he
[1:37:16] fortified it with the best thing that he
[1:37:18] could find
[1:37:19] because it's his own children and he
[1:37:20] fortified the church by the word
[1:37:22] his own word just asked him
[1:37:25] to believe his word that's all there was
[1:37:27] and satan by his wisdom caused eve to
[1:37:29] break down that barrier just in one
[1:37:31] place
[1:37:31] satan admitted every bit of the word was
[1:37:33] right but said surely
[1:37:35] that's all he had to know surely you
[1:37:37] won't die now that was the loophole
[1:37:39] he got eve from behind that word with
[1:37:41] one little doubt
[1:37:42] that's exactly where he gets to church
[1:37:44] today the same thing
[1:37:46] just that one little doubt brings you on
[1:37:48] this side and now there's no way to ever
[1:37:50] try to think that god will ever spare
[1:37:52] you through belonging to a church
[1:37:53] belonging to an organization or a group
[1:37:55] or whatever it is or any sensation
[1:37:57] you've got to believe his word and act
[1:37:59] upon the same
[1:38:01] right that's the only way that's god's
[1:38:03] program at the beginning
[1:38:04] that's god's program down through life
[1:38:06] that's god's program now
[1:38:08] is the church must stay behind the word
[1:38:10] that's the only way that
[1:38:12] you can be safe
[1:38:16] but religion will come along through
[1:38:19] these devils
[1:38:22] and begin to get us to act in a way
[1:38:25] that proves we don't have trust in god
[1:38:32] see that's what caused eastfall in the
[1:38:34] beginning amen when he came when the
[1:38:36] sermon came to eve he says can you eat
[1:38:38] of all the trees and she said we can eat
[1:38:39] all the trees but the one in the midst
[1:38:40] of the garden and he says you'll not
[1:38:43] surely
[1:38:44] die for god doth know that the day you
[1:38:47] eat thereof
[1:38:48] your eyes shall be opened you shall be
[1:38:50] as gods knowing good and evil
[1:38:53] and all the sudden eve
[1:38:56] started to question whether god was
[1:38:58] holding out on her or not
[1:39:01] it was an issue of trust
[1:39:06] trusting god to be righteous trusting
[1:39:08] his way to be correct
[1:39:09] trusting his even if he withheld a
[1:39:12] revelation
[1:39:13] trusting that he was god and he was the
[1:39:15] father and he was withholding a
[1:39:17] revelation for good
[1:39:21] today the devil can try to push us into
[1:39:23] revelations and push us in
[1:39:25] to overreaching and going beyond the
[1:39:27] prophet of god
[1:39:28] and trying to get to a place that god
[1:39:30] has not opened up yet
[1:39:32] and it's an issue of trust
[1:39:35] [Music]
[1:39:37] we have to trust god amen and trust his
[1:39:40] word
[1:39:41] and trust him but the serpent will come
[1:39:43] along and do the same thing he did to
[1:39:45] eve
[1:39:45] and begin to question trust and do the
[1:39:48] same thing he did to those under
[1:39:49] nimrod's rule
[1:39:50] they began to question whether they
[1:39:52] could trust god to keep his word
[1:39:54] and eve was made to to to lack
[1:39:58] trust in god's way in god's timing
[1:40:02] in in god's word
[1:40:06] and i say today the devil will come
[1:40:09] along
[1:40:10] and try to attack us and trust
[1:40:15] and brother branham said we're fortified
[1:40:18] behind the word
[1:40:20] and this bride stays behind the word and
[1:40:23] trust him to keep his word
[1:40:26] we trust him to do what he said he would
[1:40:28] do trust him to keep his word
[1:40:30] and to provide everything that we have
[1:40:32] need of because he said he would
[1:40:34] we don't have to protect ourselves we
[1:40:35] don't have to figure anything out
[1:40:37] we don't have to push a head too far
[1:40:41] we just trusted him i want to read just
[1:40:45] a couple more quotes
[1:40:50] he said and satan's eden satan wanted
[1:40:53] and he took it over and he had six
[1:40:54] thousand years to build up his eden
[1:40:56] as god had six thousand years to bring
[1:40:58] his eating to close and by deceit the
[1:41:00] seed of the word
[1:41:01] or the people now establishes his own
[1:41:03] eden
[1:41:04] in this earth in sin god's eden was
[1:41:07] established in righteousness
[1:41:09] satan's eden is established in sin
[1:41:11] because satan is sin
[1:41:13] god is righteousness and god's kingdom
[1:41:15] was established in righteousness and
[1:41:17] peace and life
[1:41:18] and satan's establishment is in sin
[1:41:22] and religious sin
[1:41:26] so satan established his eden
[1:41:29] not on drunks and harlots and
[1:41:31] prostitutes
[1:41:33] catch this satan has established his
[1:41:36] eden
[1:41:37] on religious sin religious
[1:41:41] unbelief
[1:41:45] it sounds like an oxymoron but it's the
[1:41:47] absolute purpose of religion
[1:41:49] the purpose of the religion is to gather
[1:41:52] unbelievers
[1:41:55] that's what nimrod did nobody would
[1:41:58] waste one drop of sweat to put one brick
[1:42:01] down
[1:42:02] who believed that god would never send a
[1:42:03] flood again
[1:42:08] the religion of the day was to gather
[1:42:10] unbelievers
[1:42:13] and religion today is to gather
[1:42:16] unbelievers because those who believe
[1:42:18] the word of god
[1:42:19] don't need religion don't need a
[1:42:22] structure don't need a form
[1:42:24] don't need to perform something do
[1:42:26] something show something
[1:42:27] to have security their security is in
[1:42:29] the token because the token
[1:42:31] shows the covenant is still in effect
[1:42:36] amen that's why all the way back in
[1:42:38] egypt all they needed to do was what
[1:42:40] that prophet told him to do
[1:42:41] and slay that lamb and take that blood
[1:42:43] and put it on the lentil and on the door
[1:42:45] and that was the token that they were in
[1:42:47] a covenant with god and the death angel
[1:42:49] would pass
[1:42:50] amen they didn't have an experience it
[1:42:52] had never happened before
[1:42:53] they couldn't prove it they couldn't
[1:42:55] guarantee it
[1:42:58] they couldn't show the last time they
[1:43:00] couldn't they couldn't demonstrate it
[1:43:01] year after year
[1:43:02] amen this was the first time they were
[1:43:04] faced with this situation
[1:43:05] but god had sent a prophet on the scene
[1:43:07] to give him his word and a token
[1:43:09] that would show that he's in covenant
[1:43:11] with them and he will not
[1:43:13] let the death angel enter that home that
[1:43:15] had followed the word
[1:43:19] and now the token on the door was
[1:43:22] evidence that the people in the house
[1:43:24] believed that prophet
[1:43:28] and in believing that prophet they
[1:43:30] believed god
[1:43:33] god has given us his token this day and
[1:43:35] this token is his life
[1:43:39] a revelation of jesus christ personally
[1:43:41] to you
[1:43:44] a relationship it's just you and him
[1:43:50] and you can't prove nothing guarantee
[1:43:53] anything
[1:43:55] demonstrate
[1:43:58] show a certificate
[1:44:02] but you're asked to have confidence in
[1:44:03] that token
[1:44:06] and that token is the life of the word
[1:44:08] and the token on display
[1:44:10] is the life of the word through you and
[1:44:13] all you're asked to do is receive it
[1:44:15] and believe it and then let him manifest
[1:44:27] and satan's even again he said the god
[1:44:29] of this world today
[1:44:31] the worshiped person of this world today
[1:44:33] is satan
[1:44:34] and the people are ignorant of
[1:44:36] worshiping satan
[1:44:37] but it's satan impersonating himself as
[1:44:40] the church
[1:44:42] see as the church they worship satan
[1:44:45] thinking they are worshiping god through
[1:44:46] the church but it's the way satan has
[1:44:48] done it
[1:44:49] oh you say but wait a minute we preached
[1:44:50] the word look back here at my text
[1:44:52] tonight satan was the one that preached
[1:44:54] the word to eve first
[1:44:56] god hath said see it's that misc oh
[1:45:00] dial in for this last little this last
[1:45:03] little punch of the devil and then we'll
[1:45:04] go
[1:45:07] it's that misconstruing that part of the
[1:45:10] scripture that applies to the day
[1:45:14] that's the error that's the problem
[1:45:17] you can preach all the past word you can
[1:45:19] preach all about jesus at calvary
[1:45:22] you can preach all about walking on
[1:45:23] water and miracles and disciples and
[1:45:26] church ages and paul amen but it's
[1:45:28] misconstruing that
[1:45:30] word that's for the day that's the
[1:45:32] deception
[1:45:33] that's the trap they preached the word
[1:45:35] like he preached the word
[1:45:36] satan came as the serpent came and had
[1:45:38] the word but he was misconstruing that
[1:45:41] commandment that was for the day
[1:45:45] amen that's why we're not we're not even
[1:45:48] we're not even bothered amen by all the
[1:45:51] other denominations and things that are
[1:45:52] out there
[1:45:53] but it's that demon spirit that will get
[1:45:55] in and try to come close to where the
[1:45:57] bride is
[1:45:58] and misconstrue that word for today
[1:46:03] pointing to the past looking back
[1:46:05] preaching something else
[1:46:06] but misconstruing the word for today
[1:46:12] he'll let you know all that jesus did
[1:46:13] was perfectly well he'll let you know
[1:46:15] all that moses did was perfectly well
[1:46:17] but when you take the promises that they
[1:46:19] gave for this day
[1:46:20] then that was applied to another age so
[1:46:23] they'll take the word for today
[1:46:25] and they'll either put it back or put it
[1:46:27] forward
[1:46:29] and if you put it back or put it forward
[1:46:32] that's the deception
[1:46:35] that's the devil right there
[1:46:40] what will they do quote the word
[1:46:44] use the scriptures
[1:46:47] but take the word for today and either
[1:46:48] put it back there or forward there
[1:46:55] when you take that promise that they
[1:46:56] gave for this day then that was applied
[1:46:58] to another age that's just
[1:47:00] all he has to do see is to get the
[1:47:02] people to believe it that way
[1:47:03] and that's all for you cannot take one
[1:47:05] word away from it or add one word to it
[1:47:08] but that's what he does
[1:47:15] brother bev says in the token god once
[1:47:17] gave a token to the people
[1:47:19] and that was a rainbow looky listen
[1:47:22] close we're closing
[1:47:23] god ever remained true to that token way
[1:47:26] back in the days of noah the destruction
[1:47:28] that entered the luvian world god gave
[1:47:29] this nation or give the world
[1:47:31] a rainbow sign for a token and god ever
[1:47:34] displays his token as the thousands of
[1:47:36] years rolled by
[1:47:37] he never fails because he watches his
[1:47:39] tokens
[1:47:41] all these thousands of years he has
[1:47:43] displayed it to us showing us that he
[1:47:45] never fails to honor the token he never
[1:47:47] fails to honor it
[1:47:48] he expects us now to display the token
[1:47:51] over our faith
[1:47:52] to satan's group and the unbelievers and
[1:47:54] the cults and so forth
[1:47:55] that don't believe in him that we
[1:47:56] believe what he has said of his promises
[1:47:59] and that jesus christ is raised up from
[1:48:01] the dead showing himself alive
[1:48:03] and that is the badge the token of
[1:48:05] identification because it's christ's
[1:48:07] own life in you identifying the word
[1:48:11] it doesn't need anything else
[1:48:16] let's stand
[1:48:20] praise god
[1:48:25] i hope you're enjoying this as much as i
[1:48:27] am
[1:48:29] brother branham said the devil's tactics
[1:48:32] have been exposed
[1:48:36] and he doesn't like it
[1:48:39] but the bridegroom is here to make sure
[1:48:42] that we don't fall back into these old
[1:48:44] traps
[1:48:46] we don't need religious we don't need a
[1:48:47] religious order
[1:48:50] all we need is him and he is coming this
[1:48:53] day
[1:48:54] to unite individually with each one of
[1:48:57] his elect bride
[1:48:58] and that is their security that is their
[1:49:01] token
[1:49:02] that is the word for this day
[1:49:07] and god has brought a security to his
[1:49:09] bride
[1:49:10] and he's brought an open word to her and
[1:49:12] he's here himself
[1:49:14] unveiling the word
[1:49:17] so that he would ensure that this day
[1:49:21] he will have a bride that won't fail
[1:49:26] now i want you to think back every bride
[1:49:28] that failed before how did they fail
[1:49:30] they failed by religion
[1:49:36] but he's going to have a bride this day
[1:49:38] that won't fail
[1:49:39] not because she's smarter but because
[1:49:41] he's here
[1:49:44] have confidence in that believe him
[1:49:48] don't get sucked into a religious order
[1:49:51] some sort of performance or
[1:49:52] pressure just connect with him
[1:49:56] and let his life and you be the token
[1:49:59] your security your past your fair is
[1:50:02] paid
[1:50:03] i'm not going into the judgment i've
[1:50:05] already bypassed the judgment
[1:50:08] i'm not here to protect myself defend
[1:50:10] myself work anything out
[1:50:12] it's already been worked out at calvary
[1:50:14] and i've got the token that the covenant
[1:50:16] is still in effect for me
[1:50:18] i can't prove it for you or anybody else
[1:50:20] and i can't put it on anybody else
[1:50:22] but the token is the there's an evidence
[1:50:24] that the covenant is in effect for me
[1:50:27] and today it's an individual
[1:50:31] token it's an individual walk it's an
[1:50:34] individual work don't get sucked back in
[1:50:39] to a group no more towers
[1:50:43] they were useless and they've been
[1:50:46] useless
[1:50:48] every one of them has been worthless
[1:50:50] salvation has come through none of them
[1:50:53] salvation has always come by the word
[1:50:55] for your day
[1:50:57] the elect seed has always found their
[1:50:59] way to the atonement through the
[1:51:00] revealed word for their day
[1:51:02] never through the system
[1:51:05] i thank god that he's brought a word for
[1:51:07] this day
[1:51:08] and he's given us a heart to believe
[1:51:12] he gave it to us that's his gift that's
[1:51:15] his seed on the inside
[1:51:16] that has the capacity to say that's
[1:51:18] nothing but the truth
[1:51:21] and i receive it and i yield to it and i
[1:51:24] give my whole life to that
[1:51:27] praise be to god let's bow our heads and
[1:51:29] pray
[1:51:30] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[1:51:32] jesus for your word
