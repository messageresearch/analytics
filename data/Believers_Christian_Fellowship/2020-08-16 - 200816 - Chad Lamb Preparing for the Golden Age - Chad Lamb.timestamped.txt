[1:16] [Music]
[1:24] so
[1:33] there is a lighter
[1:41] on a hillside
[1:43] [Music]

[7:26] to be
[7:42] my heart
[8:10] glory
[8:14] praise god let's go ahead and stand and
[8:16] go to first peter chapter four
[8:20] we'll start there i'd like for a subject
[8:22] for a title i'd like to just take uh
[8:24] preparing for the golden age and
[8:27] just along the lines of what we've been
[8:28] talking about for the last several weeks
[8:30] god is still stirring in my hearts and
[8:32] things along these lines and i'd like to
[8:35] look at the life of solomon and solomon
[8:36] coming into power
[8:38] and it's just interesting we've talked
[8:40] and touched on these things before but
[8:42] i can't get away from it my attention
[8:43] keeps getting drawn back here
[8:45] so we'll see what the lord has for us
[8:47] today first peter 4 17
[8:51] for the time has come that judgment must
[8:53] begin at the house of god and if it
[8:55] first begin at us what shall the end be
[8:58] of them
[8:59] that obey not the gospel of god
[9:02] i mean let's pray lord jesus we thank
[9:05] you for this day and
[9:07] for your goodness to us lord we thank
[9:09] you god that you've extended such mercy
[9:11] and grace in our lives to bring us here
[9:14] that we might feed on your word lord the
[9:16] word of life lord the word of this hour
[9:19] that we might know you as you are lord
[9:21] as you reveal yourself to us
[9:23] lord i pray that you would take us a
[9:26] little higher today lord that we might
[9:27] see you more clearly
[9:29] god that we might see ourselves more
[9:31] clearly as well and
[9:32] we might follow after you with all of
[9:34] our heart i pray you would accomplish
[9:36] your great purpose in our lives
[9:38] we ask that you would do it this this
[9:40] morning that you would carry us from
[9:42] here to whatever purpose you have for us
[9:44] as individuals
[9:46] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[9:49] you can have your seats and when you sit
[9:52] down let's turn to first
[9:54] chronicles and we're going to read quite
[9:56] a few scriptures so keep your bibles
[9:58] handy
[9:59] i want to look at this story as this
[10:00] story unfolds through the scripture
[10:03] and following solomon coming to the
[10:05] throne and we know that
[10:07] david was a great king and then david
[10:09] was god's choice to be king we know
[10:11] saul was the choice of the people or
[10:14] what god had chose to fulfill the desire
[10:16] of the people what they wanted in a king
[10:18] a great man a warrior a man that was
[10:20] head and shoulders
[10:21] but when god chose a king he he was
[10:24] looking for character
[10:25] not size he was looking for character
[10:28] not ability
[10:29] so he chose david who was a man after
[10:31] his own heart
[10:32] and so you follow the life of david and
[10:34] we see
[10:35] that david you know routed the enemies
[10:37] david was a great warrior
[10:39] he led israel in many battles and
[10:41] destroyed
[10:43] destroyed all of the the enemies the
[10:46] philistines
[10:47] all of the canaanite enemies that were
[10:48] there and he brought a a relative peace
[10:52] to the kingdom by the end of his life
[10:54] amen but god god had another thing to do
[10:57] to move israel to the golden age there
[10:58] was another step
[11:00] and in that step it was going to be a
[11:01] transition from david to solomon
[11:04] and brother bam tells us in many places
[11:05] that solomon is a type of christ
[11:08] and solomon is a type of christ moving
[11:10] into that position
[11:12] moves them into a golden age and i would
[11:15] like to look at how he does that
[11:17] because it's very interesting let's look
[11:19] at the first chronicles 22 and verse 7.
[11:24] and yeah first chronicles
[11:28] 22-7 and david said to solomon my son
[11:32] as for me it was in my mind to build a
[11:34] house into the name of the lord my god
[11:37] but the word of the lord came to me
[11:38] saying thou has shed blood
[11:40] abundantly and has made great wars thou
[11:43] shalt not build a house unto my name
[11:45] because thou has shed much blood upon
[11:46] the earth in my sight
[11:48] behold a son shall be born to thee who
[11:50] shall be a man of rest
[11:52] and i will give him rest from all his
[11:54] enemies round about for his name shall
[11:55] be solomon
[11:56] which means peace name shall be solomon
[11:59] and i will give
[12:00] peace and quietness unto israel in his
[12:03] days
[12:04] he shall build a house for my name and
[12:06] he shall be my son and
[12:07] i will be his father i will establish
[12:10] the throne of his kingdom
[12:11] over israel forever now my son the lord
[12:15] be with thee and prosper thou
[12:17] and build the house of the lord thy god
[12:19] as he has said of thee
[12:20] only the lord give thee wisdom and
[12:22] understanding and give thee charge
[12:23] concerning israel
[12:25] that thou mayest keep the law of the
[12:26] lord thy god
[12:28] so we see so david now is passing on
[12:31] uh the word to his his instructions to
[12:33] solomon and solomon's coming into the
[12:35] kingdom
[12:37] and he reversed to him to a prophecy a
[12:40] word from the lord that
[12:41] word the lord gave to david concerning
[12:43] solomon
[12:44] said he'll be a man of rest and he'll be
[12:46] at rest all about so now israel's going
[12:48] to move to the golden age they're going
[12:49] to move into the rest
[12:50] which is a type of our holy ghost amen
[12:52] moving into the rest holy ghost baptism
[12:55] and he said now now he's going to be a
[12:58] man of rest and he's the son of david
[13:01] he's the prince of peace and in here he
[13:03] says he'll be a son to me and i'll be
[13:05] his father
[13:06] so he's the son of god so he's a he's a
[13:08] perfect type of jesus christ
[13:10] here early in his ministry so when we
[13:12] look at this we're we're looking at a
[13:13] type or a foreshadow of christ and what
[13:15] christ will do
[13:17] and so brother brother bam says in the
[13:20] message the queen of the south
[13:21] god raised solomon up as a type of
[13:23] christ the son of david
[13:25] and gave him a gift and he says then all
[13:27] the nation rallied around that gift and
[13:29] they began to prosper because they
[13:30] rallied
[13:31] around the gift and they supported the
[13:33] gift amen that god had sent
[13:35] and they yielded themselves to that gift
[13:37] and god established them
[13:38] in peace amen let's turn over to first
[13:41] kings chapter 3
[13:43] and start reading from there
[13:55] first kings chapter 3 and verse 5.
[14:01] we went through this a a a while back a
[14:03] few weeks ago i don't remember how long
[14:05] but let's read through this again
[14:06] first kings three and five in gibeon the
[14:09] lord appeared to solomon in a dream by
[14:11] night
[14:12] and god said ask what i shall give thee
[14:15] and solomon said thou has showed unto
[14:17] thy servant david my father great mercy
[14:20] according as he walked before thee in
[14:21] truth
[14:22] and in righteousness and an uprightness
[14:24] of heart with thee
[14:25] and thou has kept for him this great
[14:27] kindness that thou has given him a son
[14:29] to sit on his throne
[14:30] as it is this day and now o lord my god
[14:34] thou has made thy servant king instead
[14:36] of david my father
[14:37] and i am but a little child i know not
[14:39] how to go out
[14:40] or come in and thy servant is in the
[14:43] midst of thy people which thou has
[14:45] chosen a great people that cannot be
[14:47] numbered nor counted for multitude
[14:49] give therefore thy servant an
[14:51] understanding heart to judge thy people
[14:53] that i may discern between good and bad
[14:55] for who is able to judge this thy so
[14:57] great
[14:58] a people and the speech pleased the lord
[15:00] that
[15:01] solomon had asked this thing and god
[15:03] said unto him because thou has asked
[15:05] this thing and has not asked for thyself
[15:07] long life
[15:08] neither has asked riches for thyself nor
[15:11] has to ask the life of thine enemies but
[15:13] has asked for
[15:14] thyself understanding to discern
[15:16] judgment
[15:17] behold i have done according to thy
[15:19] words so i have given thee
[15:21] a wise and an understanding heart so
[15:23] that there was none
[15:24] likely before thee neither after thee
[15:27] shall any arise
[15:28] like unto thee so we read this before
[15:31] but god was pleased at solomon because
[15:33] solomon
[15:34] when he had an opportunity to get
[15:35] anything he wanted god says
[15:37] you know what shall i give thee and he
[15:39] says i'm but a little child and solomon
[15:41] was able to humble himself before god
[15:44] amen because jesus christ would only do
[15:46] what the father showed him
[15:47] jesus was able to humble himself under
[15:50] the father
[15:51] and solomon now humbles himself and says
[15:53] hey this is a great people this is a
[15:55] mighty people
[15:56] and i'm but a little child i can't lead
[15:58] this people i need understanding
[16:00] i need wisdom and god was pleased what
[16:03] solomon asked for and says i'll give you
[16:04] an understanding heart
[16:06] you'll be wise there'll be none like you
[16:08] none like you before
[16:09] there'll be none like you after amen and
[16:11] i'll give you the things that you didn't
[16:12] ask for
[16:13] riches and wealth and if you'll follow
[16:15] me long life
[16:16] so we know solomon solomon was god's
[16:19] choice amen
[16:20] others thought that they were right
[16:21] absalom thought that he was he would
[16:23] have been the right one and he
[16:24] by himself made himself the choice and
[16:27] maybe the people's choice maybe the
[16:29] people thought absalom
[16:30] would have been the choice but solomon
[16:32] was god's choice
[16:34] because god is always expressed in
[16:36] humility because the way up is always
[16:38] the way down
[16:39] and solomon didn't have the nicest birth
[16:41] he didn't come
[16:42] the nicest way there was a there was
[16:45] controversy
[16:46] in in his past in his in his with his
[16:49] parents
[16:50] but yet god brought solomon in such a
[16:52] way that god could bestow upon him
[16:54] wisdom because he approached humbly he
[16:56] asked for the right thing
[16:58] and god is now trying to establish
[17:00] israel now jerusalem
[17:02] uh brother branham says the the church
[17:04] natural
[17:05] types the church spiritual so when we
[17:07] look back at here we're not just trying
[17:08] to learn something about the nation of
[17:10] israel and the jews we're trying to see
[17:12] something about us about the church and
[17:13] the journey we've been on
[17:15] and jerusalem is a is a type of the
[17:17] church brother branham said the
[17:19] headquarters of the church the
[17:20] headquarters of the
[17:21] the religion amen is in jerusalem so
[17:23] jerusalem is a type of the church and
[17:25] and israel's a type of the church so
[17:27] when we look at this we want to we want
[17:28] to glean from this
[17:30] for ourselves uh the scripture says that
[17:33] the
[17:34] fear of the lord is the beginning of
[17:35] wisdom the fear of the lord to just obey
[17:38] to keep his commandments to obey the
[17:40] lord is the beginning of wisdom
[17:42] amen not to be so wise that we we come
[17:45] up with our own idea and make our own
[17:46] choices and go our own way and use our
[17:48] own reasoning
[17:49] amen that's not the beginning of wisdom
[17:51] amen sometimes we think wisdom is
[17:53] knowing a lot
[17:55] and wisdom is not an abundance of
[17:57] knowledge amen
[17:58] wisdom is the ability to discern right
[18:01] and wrong and apply the word in the
[18:02] right way
[18:04] you know jesus was wise amen but the
[18:07] pharisees and the sadducees the
[18:08] religious leaders they had knowledge of
[18:10] the word
[18:10] and they come to jesus and start asking
[18:12] jesus questions
[18:13] and it proved the wisdom that was in
[18:15] jesus because jesus could properly place
[18:17] the word
[18:18] they couldn't properly place the word
[18:21] they began to ask him you know they
[18:22] asked him questions like
[18:25] tribute money should be given to caesar
[18:26] we give unto god
[18:28] trying to trap him always trying to
[18:29] stumble him amen by the word
[18:31] but jesus has wisdom not just knowledge
[18:34] and he says bring me the tribute money
[18:36] and he looks upon it and says who
[18:38] inscription
[18:39] is that they said caesar so give to
[18:40] caesar what caesars and give to god
[18:42] what's god's
[18:43] now they have nothing to say they come
[18:46] and they bring to him a woman caught in
[18:48] the very act of adultery
[18:50] and they say she's caught in the very
[18:52] act of adultery amen
[18:53] and they they did this tempting him to
[18:56] test him to have an accusation against
[18:58] him
[18:59] so i don't know if they were hoping that
[19:00] he would let her go and they say he
[19:01] doesn't keep the law or he would condemn
[19:04] her to death i don't know what they were
[19:05] looking for
[19:06] but they were looking for in a way to
[19:08] accuse him amen and they were trying to
[19:10] use the word to trap the word
[19:14] and he was the word how are you going to
[19:16] use the word to trap the word
[19:17] amen jesus now he he just
[19:20] he doesn't say anything he just bends
[19:22] down and starts riding amen in the sand
[19:24] and i've said many times
[19:25] i would love to have a picture of what
[19:27] he wrote in the sand and know what it
[19:29] was that he wrote
[19:30] because whatever it was he wrote amen it
[19:33] was
[19:33] something discernible to the people who
[19:36] were there
[19:37] because it was he didn't say anything
[19:39] you know he began to write
[19:40] amen he gets up and he says you who are
[19:42] without sin cast the first stone
[19:44] and he goes back and starts writing
[19:46] again i mean i don't believe it was just
[19:48] the statement
[19:49] if you're without sin that caused him to
[19:51] walk away i think it was the statement
[19:53] in conjunction with what was written in
[19:54] the sand
[19:56] loved to know what it was because it was
[20:00] a setup we've talked about this before
[20:02] we all know it was a set up
[20:03] because here you have a woman caught in
[20:05] the very act of adultery
[20:06] if she's caught in the very act of
[20:08] adultery there was a man there too
[20:11] and where is the man where did they
[20:13] bring the man because it was all the
[20:14] setup and jesus could see through it
[20:16] amen because they had not the love of
[20:19] god they only had a love for self
[20:21] and they were coming against jesus
[20:22] because jesus was a threat to their
[20:24] religion
[20:26] and this is this is really what i i want
[20:29] to talk about today is
[20:31] is is the pharisees and sadducees i
[20:33] don't want to lump them all together but
[20:35] the ones that jesus had discourse with
[20:36] so often
[20:38] they did not love the word
[20:41] because the word was made manifest
[20:42] standing before them and they didn't
[20:44] love
[20:44] it but they loved amen they loved the
[20:47] rhema
[20:48] or the written word and the position
[20:50] that that word put them in
[20:51] they loved their religion they didn't
[20:53] love god
[20:56] and so now jesus is they're trying to
[20:59] trap him
[21:00] with the word amen because they love the
[21:02] religion they don't love god if they
[21:03] knew
[21:04] god they would be looking at the picture
[21:05] differently than what they're looking at
[21:08] and so now jesus uh he he
[21:12] writes in the sand he tells him you're
[21:14] without sin cast the first stone
[21:16] amen and whatever it was he wrote and
[21:18] whatever way he handled it
[21:19] he handled it perfectly by wisdom amen
[21:22] because solomon was just a forerunner
[21:24] amen
[21:25] a foreshadow of jesus christ the wisdom
[21:27] that was in solomon
[21:28] was in jesus christ and they all leave
[21:31] and
[21:32] then he looks at the woman he said woman
[21:34] where are thine accusers
[21:36] and she says i have none and he says
[21:40] neither do i accuse you
[21:42] go and sin no more amen
[21:45] see jesus
[21:49] never left the word in judgment and
[21:52] discernment
[21:55] it wasn't an issue of intellect of
[21:59] reasoning and he just never left the
[22:01] word
[22:02] he knew that they were off the word
[22:04] because if that woman was caught in the
[22:06] act
[22:07] they're already off the word by not
[22:09] bringing the man so he knows
[22:10] something's wrong here because they've
[22:12] already left the word
[22:14] you realize so many people want to come
[22:16] and bring a portion of the word
[22:18] to try to bring a condemnation or try to
[22:20] change your opinion or get you to think
[22:22] differently or change a decision you
[22:24] make
[22:24] but they leave out a whole nother
[22:26] portion of the word
[22:28] and they just bring the portion that
[22:30] they want you to see to try to persuade
[22:32] you their way
[22:33] and it's like it's negligent sometimes
[22:36] in the rest of the word that's left out
[22:39] and you realize there's something fishy
[22:41] here amen
[22:42] they want me to keep the word but they
[22:44] haven't kept the word they caught on the
[22:45] very act they brought a woman with no
[22:47] man
[22:48] right off the bat amen their motive is
[22:50] impure because they don't love god they
[22:52] don't want to keep his word they want to
[22:54] keep their religious order going
[22:57] and they don't want to be threatened by
[22:58] this prophet from galilee amen who's
[23:01] shaking up their whole system
[23:05] praise be to god remember spirits don't
[23:07] die
[23:08] nothing changes only the people
[23:11] everything else stays the same amen and
[23:14] jesus is here
[23:15] and he says woman where are their
[23:16] accusers because nobody can be put to
[23:18] death without the witness of two or
[23:20] three
[23:21] 2 or 3 so jesus gets rid of the
[23:23] witnesses
[23:27] because he's not going to leave the word
[23:30] he knows they're off the word but their
[23:31] being off the word will not make him get
[23:33] off the word
[23:35] he knows it's a setup he knows it's the
[23:36] trap but he's not going to leave the
[23:38] word
[23:39] amen just because he knows they're off
[23:41] the word
[23:42] and so he says woman where their
[23:44] accusers he says
[23:46] she says i have none he says neither do
[23:48] i accuse you amen because you
[23:50] have to be an eyewitness
[23:53] jesus wasn't there but he knows she's
[23:56] guilty
[23:58] because he says go and sin
[24:01] no more what a statement to make
[24:05] amen jesus knows that she's guilty amen
[24:07] but by the law
[24:09] by the law he cannot condemn her to
[24:11] death
[24:14] so he sets her free why because he
[24:16] stayed with the word
[24:18] you see so many times when we face
[24:20] situations and we come into
[24:22] obstacles amen we have a difficulty
[24:24] sometimes discerning what to do but
[24:26] discernment is always by the word
[24:28] friends
[24:28] discernment is by the word god has given
[24:31] us his word we have it in written form
[24:33] amen we have it translated in our
[24:34] language and god sent a prophet in this
[24:36] day
[24:37] so that we have the perfect
[24:38] interpretation of the word
[24:41] but so many times we want to mix in some
[24:43] reasoning
[24:44] because we don't know how the word
[24:46] applies to this situation
[24:47] and we don't know what to do in these
[24:49] circumstances and we face these issues
[24:51] we face
[24:51] issues that we really don't find the
[24:54] exact scripture to plug and play
[24:56] i don't know what to do and i would say
[24:58] in those times
[24:59] it's time to wait don't get ahead of god
[25:02] but just wait
[25:03] wait for god to bring his word on the
[25:05] scene wait for god to bring clarity out
[25:07] of the scriptures
[25:08] and then move forward by the scriptures
[25:11] because that's where our discernment
[25:13] comes from
[25:14] from the word
[25:18] praise god so we see that
[25:21] jesus was also displaying to us the
[25:24] wisdom that was in solomon
[25:27] and solomon amen as a
[25:30] son of david as the son of god as the
[25:33] prince of peace
[25:35] was foreshadowing jesus christ
[25:40] i'm going to read to you out of luke 11
[25:41] stay in chronicles and kings because
[25:43] we're going to go right back here but he
[25:44] says
[25:45] jesus says in luke 11 31 the queen of
[25:48] the south shall rise up in the judgment
[25:50] with the men of this generation and
[25:51] condemn them
[25:52] for she came from the uttermost parts of
[25:54] the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon
[25:56] and behold a greater than solomon is
[25:59] here
[26:00] brother branham made this statement over
[26:03] and over he preached the message on
[26:04] the queen of the south the queen of
[26:06] sheba greater than solomon i mean he's
[26:08] got all kinds of titles and he's trying
[26:10] to get us to see that there's a man here
[26:12] that can turn on the light that there's
[26:13] a greater than solomon
[26:14] what was there amen was in jesus day
[26:17] what was in jesus
[26:18] day is in our day amen and brother
[26:21] branham wasn't talking about himself
[26:23] friends when he said the greater than
[26:25] the psalmist is here he wasn't talking
[26:26] about himself
[26:27] i mean he was talking about the one that
[26:28] was there working through him and if
[26:30] there was a greater than solomon
[26:32] there amen that day when brother brennan
[26:34] was there discerning
[26:35] there's still a greater than solomon
[26:37] here today that is able to discern our
[26:40] situations
[26:43] amen let's look at this in second
[26:47] chronicles
[26:51] second chronicles chapter nine
[27:03] second chronicles nine and verse 1.
[27:07] and when the queen of sheba heard of the
[27:09] fame of solomon
[27:11] she came to prove solomon with hard
[27:13] questions at jerusalem
[27:15] with a very great company and camels
[27:17] that bear spices and
[27:19] and gold and abundance and precious
[27:20] stones and when she was come to solomon
[27:23] she commended she communed with him
[27:25] of all that was in her heart and solomon
[27:28] told her all her questions
[27:30] and there was nothing hid from solomon
[27:32] which he told her not
[27:34] and when the queen of sheba had seen the
[27:36] wisdom of solomon in the house that he
[27:38] had built
[27:39] and the meat of his table and the
[27:40] setting of his servants and the
[27:41] attendants of his ministers and their
[27:43] apparel
[27:44] his cup bears also in their apparel and
[27:46] his ascent by which he went up to the
[27:47] house of the lord and
[27:48] there was no more spirit in her and she
[27:51] said to the king it was a true report
[27:53] which i heard in my own land of my thine
[27:55] acts and of thy wisdom
[27:57] howbeit i believe not their words until
[27:59] i came and mine eyes had seen it and
[28:02] behold the one half of the greatness of
[28:04] thy wisdom has not
[28:05] told me for thou thou exceedeth the fame
[28:08] that i heard
[28:09] happier thy men and happier these thy
[28:12] servants which stand continually before
[28:14] thee
[28:15] and hear thy wisdom blessed be the lord
[28:17] thy god which delighted
[28:18] in thee to set thee on his throne to be
[28:21] king for the lord
[28:22] thy god because thy god loved israel to
[28:25] establish them forever therefore made
[28:28] he the king over them to do judgment
[28:31] and justice so she recognized what was
[28:34] there she heard it she didn't believe it
[28:36] she traveled to it and she saw the
[28:39] wisdom of solomon
[28:40] to answer all of her hard questions
[28:44] she had hard questions and sometimes i
[28:46] wonder what her questions might have
[28:47] been
[28:48] so many times you know we tried to
[28:49] surmise you know it might have been you
[28:51] know
[28:52] how did the earth get here and in its
[28:53] orbit and the bible said that he spoke
[28:55] of birds and insects and all kinds of
[28:57] stuff but i wonder if she didn't wonder
[29:00] maybe maybe her questions this is just
[29:03] me
[29:03] maybe your questions were about the
[29:05] original sin and how we got in this
[29:07] state that we're in and
[29:08] and why is the world and the way it's in
[29:10] and why is there death and murder and
[29:12] why
[29:12] why is god a good god and why are we a
[29:14] fallen people
[29:15] and why are there so many religious
[29:18] ideas out there and why so many churches
[29:20] and
[29:22] i mean these are hard questions amen
[29:24] what happened amen and what happened to
[29:26] the original earth that was under the
[29:28] waters and and what
[29:29] what happened in heaven with lucifer
[29:31] what happened with all these things
[29:32] these are hard questions
[29:34] who can answer them who can go back and
[29:37] and tell us that there was war in heaven
[29:39] before the foundational world who can go
[29:41] back and tell us amen that there was
[29:42] something on earth
[29:44] before it was covered in water in
[29:46] genesis 1 2.
[29:48] who can tell us amen how god amen
[29:51] cast the stars in heaven who told us who
[29:53] could tell us where he wrote his first
[29:55] bible
[29:56] who can tell us where he wrote a second
[29:57] bible
[29:59] who can answer these hard questions amen
[30:01] for this gentile woman that has come
[30:03] amen to see solomon amen it's the wisdom
[30:06] of solomon amen to take
[30:08] what's in the mind of god amen and break
[30:10] it to the people
[30:11] i say there's a greater than solomon
[30:13] that's still here
[30:15] they can tell us why we're here why
[30:16] we're in this condition where we came
[30:18] from where we're going to
[30:19] amen and how to travel the road now
[30:21] greater than solomon is here
[30:25] and i'll tell you if you really if you
[30:27] really study the message you come across
[30:29] things brother benham said
[30:30] it is absolutely astonishing because it
[30:32] says solomon spoke of birds and trees
[30:34] and
[30:35] insects and all these other stuff and
[30:37] brother branham does the exact same
[30:39] thing
[30:39] he tells us amen about the animals
[30:41] knowing about an earthquake
[30:43] he tells us amen that that
[30:46] that sometimes a woman she can't
[30:48] conceive just because she's all nervous
[30:50] and worried about it but if she'll adopt
[30:51] a child or something like that watch
[30:52] she'll get pregnant again
[30:54] amen the same thing science has proven
[30:57] who even say a woman has trouble getting
[31:00] pregnant there's something in her blood
[31:01] and they found that to be true
[31:03] he'll talk about a cancer and how it
[31:04] gets started and they find it to be true
[31:07] where did this wisdom come from not from
[31:09] the sev
[31:10] not from the seven years or eight years
[31:12] he had in grammar school that he didn't
[31:14] complete
[31:14] amen because there's a greater than
[31:16] solomon that's here
[31:19] and he's still here
[31:22] so you know all those little things that
[31:25] brother branham would tell us amen
[31:27] and how things work in the world and how
[31:29] they used to be
[31:30] and how the the earth got knocked off
[31:33] its axis and it began to cool and
[31:35] condense the the the the uh moisture
[31:38] that was in the air and began to rain
[31:40] and cause a flood
[31:41] when it knocked over the water sloshed
[31:43] out from underneath and
[31:44] broke open the fountains of the deep and
[31:45] that's how you have noah's flood
[31:51] oh praise god we should get really
[31:53] excited i don't need to go back to
[31:55] solomon's day amen
[31:56] i don't need to go back to another day
[31:58] because there's a greater in solomon
[32:00] here today
[32:05] so that we would we would know that we
[32:08] would know
[32:09] what condition we're supposed to be and
[32:11] we would know how to be pleasing to the
[32:12] lord that the wisdom would be given to
[32:15] us through the message
[32:17] now wisdom that's given to us amen come
[32:20] to
[32:20] to rightly divide the word of god amen
[32:23] and give us the correct interpretation
[32:25] of scripture so
[32:26] it could be placed correctly for us so
[32:28] we could take that wisdom and we can
[32:29] discern
[32:30] by the word
[32:33] and the message shalom brother baby says
[32:37] no wonder he said the queen of the south
[32:38] shall rise in the judgment with her
[32:40] generation and condemned this one
[32:42] because she came from the utmost parts
[32:44] of the earth to hear the wisdom of
[32:45] solomon
[32:46] and behold a greater than solomon is
[32:48] here
[32:49] how that little queen weighed down he
[32:52] then saw that light and came from miles
[32:54] through the desert
[32:55] three months on a camel's back to hear
[32:56] the wisdom of solomon and them standing
[32:58] right there with solomon being a type a
[33:00] figure
[33:01] of him he says as you're in the message
[33:05] is your life worthy of the gospel
[33:07] do like the queen of the south did she
[33:09] came took her three months
[33:10] to get to where a man was representing
[33:12] jesus christ or the god of heaven
[33:14] solomon
[33:15] jesus said she come from the uttermost
[33:16] parts of the world to hear the wisdom of
[33:18] solomon
[33:19] and behold a greater than solomon is
[33:21] here and we know that greater than
[33:22] solomon is here
[33:24] the great holy spirit himself is here
[33:26] working through the people
[33:28] so greater than solomon is here who's
[33:30] that the great holy spirit
[33:32] himself is here working through the
[33:35] people
[33:36] and the masterpiece he said notice here
[33:38] the life that was in the husk in the
[33:39] stalk and the tassel in the husk
[33:41] all gathers in the seed and the life
[33:43] that was in the stall when
[33:44] one went to make the other justification
[33:47] made a way for sanctification
[33:48] sanctification made a way for the
[33:49] baptism of the holy ghost
[33:51] the baptism of the holy ghost made a way
[33:53] for the holy ghost itself
[33:54] to come right down in perfection back to
[33:57] the word again
[33:58] to manifest itself so he
[34:01] brother bam's talking about something
[34:03] different amen than
[34:05] just the restoration of the gifts under
[34:06] the baptism of the holy ghost and the
[34:08] pentecostal age but he's saying that
[34:10] made a way
[34:11] amen justification made a way for
[34:12] sanctification sanctification made a way
[34:15] for the baptism the holy ghost and the
[34:16] restoration of the gifts
[34:18] but that dispensation made a way for
[34:20] what
[34:21] the holy ghost itself to come right down
[34:23] in perfection
[34:24] back to the word again
[34:29] you see you see one thing builds on top
[34:33] of another on top another one thing
[34:36] rolls into another and rolls into
[34:38] another and when justification made a
[34:40] way for sanctification
[34:41] sanctification didn't do away with
[34:43] justification
[34:46] it came with it sanctification moved
[34:49] into the restoration of the gifts under
[34:50] the baptism the holy ghost amen and then
[34:52] you didn't lose sanctification you
[34:54] didn't lose justification they rolled
[34:55] into it
[34:57] and now in this dispensation we didn't
[34:59] lose the gifts under the baptism the
[35:01] holy ghost we didn't lose
[35:02] any of those things they rolled right
[35:04] into it but one was building building
[35:06] building until it comes right
[35:08] back to the original grain which is the
[35:10] word
[35:11] not a certain emotion not a certain
[35:14] dynamic thing
[35:15] but back to the original word again
[35:18] to manifest itself that's why brother
[35:22] says in the fourth seal
[35:23] it says as the natural wine reveals
[35:25] itself in a stimulation power so does
[35:28] the new wine as it reveals the word of
[35:29] god
[35:30] which is spirit the word of god which is
[35:32] spirit
[35:34] see the word itself is spirit you
[35:37] believe that
[35:38] let's read it let's see who said it and
[35:40] then we'll know whether it's truth or
[35:42] not
[35:42] saint john the sixth chapter and the 60
[35:45] or 63rd verse
[35:47] it's the spirit that quickeneth the
[35:48] flesh prophet and nothing the words that
[35:50] i speak unto you they are spirit and
[35:51] they are alive
[35:52] the word itself is spirit it's spirit
[35:55] and word form
[35:56] and then you see when it's quickened or
[35:58] brought to life the spirit of the word
[36:00] goes to work
[36:01] and acts so now we've come through
[36:04] you know what luther's age wesley's age
[36:06] pentecostal wave to come
[36:08] back to the word of gin and if you have
[36:10] the word
[36:11] amen we have the wisdom of god we have
[36:14] amen i would say we have discernment
[36:18] between right and wrong that's what
[36:21] that's what solomon asked for that's
[36:23] what god gave him amen
[36:25] but we see discernment by the word and
[36:27] the message the feast of trumpets
[36:29] says the holy spirit has been bound by
[36:31] these denominational rivers
[36:33] for almost two thousand years but is to
[36:35] be loosed in the evening time
[36:37] the evening time message the holy spirit
[36:39] back in the church again
[36:41] we've talked about this many times but
[36:43] i'm going to labor on it still
[36:46] i thought the holy ghost was already in
[36:48] the church i thought the holy ghost was
[36:49] moving all through the church
[36:51] through the church it was in measure
[36:54] and in portion it was always the holy
[36:56] ghost through the church
[36:58] so what is brother branham talking about
[37:00] let's read it again so we don't miss it
[37:02] he said the holy spirit has been bound
[37:04] by these denominational rivers for
[37:05] almost 2
[37:06] 000 years so it wasn't that the holy
[37:09] ghost
[37:10] wasn't in the church through the church
[37:12] ages but it was
[37:13] bound it was bound in the churches it
[37:16] was
[37:16] limited in the churches amen it was
[37:19] resisted it could not have
[37:20] full expression or full range of motion
[37:24] but it was bound why what what
[37:26] denominational rivers by creeds and
[37:28] dogmas and reasonings
[37:30] and man's understandings and schools of
[37:32] thought was what was it doing
[37:33] binding the holy spirit so the holy
[37:35] spirit wasn't
[37:36] loosed oh my goodness it wasn't loosed
[37:39] under the pentecostal dispensation
[37:42] under the pentecostal dispensation the
[37:44] holy ghost was still bound
[37:46] [Music]
[37:48] amen i would say it was more loosed yes
[37:52] just like when you moved from luther to
[37:54] wesley it was more loose
[37:56] from wesley amen to pentecost it was
[37:58] more loose brother man said they had
[37:59] more he said he said wesley
[38:02] i had more than what luther had the
[38:04] pentecost had more than what wesley had
[38:06] it was more loose but still bound
[38:09] so we have a holy ghost that's bound
[38:11] amen and the holy ghost
[38:12] is the one that's the greater than
[38:16] solomon
[38:19] still bound but is to be loosed in the
[38:21] evening time
[38:22] by the evening time message the holy
[38:24] spirit
[38:25] back in the church again christ himself
[38:28] revealed in human flesh
[38:29] in the evening time he said he promised
[38:32] it
[38:34] there was three stages of it as i said
[38:36] the martyr's age of the martyr's age 4
[38:38] then the stage of the reformers
[38:39] and now the calling out time he said
[38:42] there's three stages for this holy ghost
[38:44] being loosed and coming back in
[38:46] amen it was through the it was through
[38:48] the martyr's time amen when they would
[38:49] give their lives as the first church age
[38:51] on
[38:52] through the dark ages it was the
[38:53] martyr's age amen then
[38:55] it was the time of the reformers and
[38:57] that goes all the way through the
[38:59] pentecostal age
[39:00] in laodicea amen the pentecostal revival
[39:03] was the last stage of the reformation
[39:06] but that was not the calling out time
[39:09] the calling out time comes
[39:10] after that because that takes place in
[39:13] the church ages
[39:14] that takes place in laodicea but god has
[39:17] called us
[39:17] out of laodicea and he's called us out
[39:19] of the church ages
[39:20] amen they call us out to meet with him
[39:23] amen a holy ghost that is
[39:25] unbound by denominational rivers
[39:28] and you can't have a holy ghost unbound
[39:30] by denominational rivers
[39:32] if you're still down in the apostasy and
[39:34] darkness and blackness of laodicea
[39:38] christ has been put on the outside in
[39:40] the laodicean h on the outside of the
[39:42] church
[39:42] amen and he showed it in the heavens
[39:44] with an eclipse of the moon where
[39:46] there's not a seventh picture because
[39:47] it's a total blackout an absolute
[39:49] apostasy
[39:50] christ put outside of his church
[39:54] see man destroys himself amen man
[39:57] man was the one who put christ out
[39:58] christ came like he said he would come
[40:00] he come like he said he would come
[40:02] according to all the old testament
[40:03] prophecies
[40:04] he's standing in jerusalem in the midst
[40:06] of his church and they put him out
[40:07] and crucified him and he suffered
[40:09] without the camp
[40:12] and so now you can't stay in that old
[40:15] system anymore
[40:16] now you've got to go wherever he went
[40:18] because he's the head the body always
[40:20] follows the head
[40:23] praise be to god where the head goes the
[40:26] body goes
[40:28] and christ is the headship the word is
[40:30] the headship amen and when the word come
[40:32] in fullness through the message of the
[40:34] hour
[40:34] amen the word was rejected which was
[40:36] jesus christ he come
[40:38] exactly like he was supposed to come at
[40:40] the end of time
[40:41] at the end of the ages and it was
[40:44] exactly what happened
[40:45] amen in revelation chapter 3 behold i
[40:48] stand at the door and knock
[40:49] he's on the outside of his church
[40:51] knocking trying to get somebody to come
[40:53] out to him
[40:55] and he's put outside the church amen now
[40:57] laodicea goes into
[40:59] absolute total apostasy there's no light
[41:02] there if there's no light
[41:05] there and christ has left the church
[41:08] christ is on the outside
[41:09] and then he suffered beyond the camp now
[41:11] brother brahma said going beyond the
[41:13] camp
[41:15] let us go out to him beyond the camp
[41:17] amen beyond the old order of jerusalem
[41:19] let's leave
[41:20] and let's go let the body follow the
[41:22] head if the headship's been put out the
[41:24] body has to leave too
[41:28] why because if you stay there the holy
[41:30] ghost is bound
[41:33] but a greater than solomon is here
[41:37] but he's not in the system he's not in
[41:41] the denomination
[41:43] he is his word he has come
[41:46] as the full revelation in the full
[41:48] measure of the full word
[41:50] and if we don't get the word we don't
[41:52] get him
[41:56] i don't know how else to say it this is
[41:58] what the prophet taught us
[42:00] many people think they have him because
[42:02] they have they have
[42:04] uh uh they have uh uh some sort of an
[42:07] emotional experience or they have
[42:09] something
[42:10] that that took place brother ben said to
[42:11] shaking or speaking in tongues or at
[42:13] dancing
[42:14] and they think they have him but what
[42:16] they got was a result of coming in
[42:17] contact with him
[42:19] those things are all true and they're
[42:21] genuine and real but to have him
[42:23] to embrace him to become one with him
[42:26] you have to receive the word
[42:29] and not portions of it that was the
[42:31] church ages that's not for us now this
[42:33] is the bride day
[42:34] this isn't a portion day this is a
[42:36] fullness day
[42:38] we receive the fullness of the word we
[42:39] may not understand the fullness of the
[42:42] word but we receive the fullness of the
[42:44] word
[42:45] we may not we may not be able to
[42:46] intellectually explain it
[42:48] but hey we don't explain it away and we
[42:50] don't put it away
[42:51] we just take it all in amen if the
[42:53] prophet taught it if it's part of the
[42:55] message i want it all
[42:58] and i'm going to receive it all amen
[43:01] even the
[43:02] hard sayings
[43:06] so now a greater than solomon is here
[43:09] but it's the unbound holy ghost
[43:13] and how do you come in contact with the
[43:16] greater than solomon that's here
[43:17] is you have to come to the unbound holy
[43:20] ghost
[43:21] and the the word is the spirit
[43:24] the words that i speak to they are
[43:25] spirit and they are alive amen when the
[43:27] word
[43:28] was restored the holy ghost was unbound
[43:33] right it's what he said but is to be
[43:35] loosed in the evening time by the
[43:37] evening time
[43:38] message to be loosed in the evening time
[43:42] by the evening time message what was the
[43:45] evening time message
[43:46] it was the third pool the sword in the
[43:49] hand
[43:50] the revelation of the seven thunders the
[43:53] opening of the seals
[43:54] the seventh seal unveiled that was the
[43:56] evening time message
[43:58] not the healing campaigns that was the
[44:00] that was the bait on the hook that was
[44:02] the lure
[44:03] amen but it was the word the opening of
[44:05] the word the restoring of all the truths
[44:07] that were lost
[44:08] amen the revelation of the seven
[44:09] mysterious thunders that were unknown in
[44:11] the book of revelation
[44:13] that is the message
[44:17] amen and that brings the holy ghost
[44:20] unbound when that when that when those
[44:23] seals were loose
[44:24] the holy ghost was unbound
[44:27] and a greater than solomon is here and
[44:29] that is the wisdom that's been given to
[44:31] us to discern right and wrong
[44:33] by what by the message by the word
[44:35] that's been restored
[44:38] so we've got to throw away our thinking
[44:41] we've got to throw away traditions we've
[44:42] got to be able to
[44:43] revisit everything with the message
[44:47] and i don't mean revisit one time i mean
[44:50] revisit and revisit
[44:51] and revisit and revisit amen because the
[44:54] mighty god is still unveiling himself
[44:56] through this message
[44:58] he is still making the word more clear
[45:00] he is still
[45:01] crystallizing things that he spoke 50 60
[45:05] years ago
[45:06] are still crystallizing to us today it's
[45:08] still becoming clearer
[45:09] amen and greater manifestation and it's
[45:12] going
[45:12] deeper than we ever thought it would go
[45:16] so we got to keep revisiting these ideas
[45:19] and revisiting
[45:20] amen and there's nothing wrong with
[45:21] revisiting because a lot of times when
[45:23] you revisit this you'd find out
[45:25] that's absolutely what he said that's
[45:27] exactly what the word says and i've just
[45:29] re-encouraged myself in the same
[45:30] revelation
[45:32] it's not changing understanding all the
[45:34] time
[45:35] it's not like i've got to oh if i'm not
[45:36] changing my understanding
[45:38] of the message every few weeks and i'm
[45:40] not growing that's not it at all folks
[45:42] some things that have been correct have
[45:44] been correct all the way through you got
[45:45] a revelation early on and it never has
[45:47] to change
[45:50] but don't think god can't take that
[45:51] revelation another layer deeper
[45:55] and it's the same thing you've believed
[45:57] the same thing you've known to be true
[45:59] all along but now
[46:00] another layer unpeels and now you see it
[46:02] in places in the bible you didn't see it
[46:04] before
[46:06] now what you saw here you see from
[46:07] genesis to revelation
[46:09] it's not a new revelation it's not
[46:11] something different amen it's just god
[46:13] unlocking more of his mystery through
[46:15] the same truth
[46:17] and when it does these things become
[46:19] clear and it gives us
[46:20] more wisdom more
[46:24] wisdom with a greater understanding of
[46:26] the word
[46:27] more wisdom to discern right and wrong
[46:30] praise god
[46:35] now after the reformers the stage of the
[46:38] reformers
[46:39] which in the i i want to be clear the
[46:42] last part of the reformation
[46:43] was the pentecostal revival now brother
[46:46] bam said the pentecostal age was the
[46:48] laodicean church age
[46:50] so we got to be real clear on that so we
[46:52] know where we're at and that was the
[46:54] finishing of the reformation
[46:58] now it's the calling out time
[47:02] calling what calling the bride out of
[47:05] the city which is the church
[47:07] to meet him outside the city or
[47:10] outside the camp that's what the
[47:12] bridegroom call came to do
[47:14] the midnight cry the friend of the
[47:16] bridegroom amen the eliezer call
[47:19] comes to call us out of the church
[47:22] systems out
[47:24] of our religion and go and meet him
[47:28] we're outside the camp outside
[47:32] of laodicea praise god
[47:36] let's turn to hebrews chapter four
[47:54] hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12.
[47:59] for the word of god is quick and
[48:00] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[48:02] sword piercing even to the dividing
[48:04] asunder of soul and spirit
[48:06] and of the joint and the morrow and is a
[48:08] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[48:09] the heart
[48:11] neither is there any creature that is
[48:12] not manifest in his sight
[48:14] but all things are naked and open unto
[48:16] the eyes of him
[48:17] with whom we have to do this is a really
[48:21] big verse
[48:22] these two verses because
[48:25] in in saying what i'm going to say i
[48:27] don't intend to take away from
[48:29] a gift of discernment like brother
[48:30] branham when he would discern something
[48:32] and god was showing something people's
[48:33] lives but i want to show
[48:34] how we've received the gift of
[48:36] discernment as a body of believers we
[48:39] received the gift of discernment amen
[48:40] because we received the word
[48:43] and it said for the word of god is quick
[48:46] and powerful
[48:47] and sharper than any two-edged sword the
[48:49] word of god
[48:50] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[48:52] soul and spirit
[48:53] and the joints in a morrow and is a
[48:55] discerner of the thoughts
[48:57] and intents of the hearts so watch the
[49:00] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[49:01] the heart
[49:02] what will come in and separate you from
[49:05] you
[49:07] the spirit from the soul and the bone if
[49:09] you're gonna if you're gonna if you're
[49:10] gonna separate the bone in the morrow
[49:13] you're separating part of you from part
[49:15] of you
[49:18] and that's pretty close cutting if you
[49:21] just
[49:22] look at it and because you know the
[49:23] morrow's like totally encased in the
[49:25] bone
[49:27] so we're going to divide that out that's
[49:28] some pretty delicate work
[49:32] and the word of god is this is able to
[49:35] do this
[49:36] is able to get down to the nitty-gritty
[49:38] and get down so
[49:39] close to the inside of the inside which
[49:42] would be your morrow
[49:44] your bones are inside and inside your
[49:46] bones or your morrow
[49:48] so the sword can get to the inside of
[49:50] the inside
[49:52] and can separate those two things just
[49:54] like the spirit and the soul
[49:56] amen it can come down and separate you
[49:58] from you amen
[49:59] the hybrid you the false you from the
[50:01] real you which is the soul
[50:03] because sometimes sometimes uh
[50:07] we we sometimes we make decisions in the
[50:10] wrong realm
[50:12] sometimes we take action and we do
[50:14] things in the spirit realm
[50:15] and you know influenced by the old
[50:16] nature amen and it's us
[50:20] right that's us but then sometimes god
[50:23] speaks to us through the word out of our
[50:24] soul
[50:25] and what's that that's us that's the
[50:28] real
[50:28] us but what is going to separate us from
[50:31] us
[50:32] the word the word is the separator the
[50:35] word is the one
[50:36] that comes and it says here in verse 13
[50:39] neither is there any creature that is
[50:40] not manifest in his sight
[50:42] but all things are naked and open unto
[50:44] the eyes of him
[50:45] which with whom we have to do
[50:49] he is the word amen and the spirit is
[50:51] the spirit of the word
[50:52] amen and the word has been given to us
[50:54] today to do what
[50:56] to discern and to
[50:59] separate us from us
[51:04] because your greatest enemy is who it's
[51:06] me the guy i look at in the mirror
[51:09] that's my enemy
[51:10] who's going to save me from my enemy
[51:12] who's going to save me from the closest
[51:14] deception that i've ever been deceived
[51:15] by
[51:16] and that's the devil using my old nature
[51:18] to bit my own voice in my own head
[51:20] to get me to leave the word can you
[51:23] think of a closer deception than that
[51:25] friends
[51:26] it's not the devil whispering in your
[51:28] ear amen it's that old nature amen using
[51:31] your voice
[51:31] in your head to get you to leave the
[51:34] word
[51:36] i know of no greater deception
[51:42] amen what can save me
[51:45] from myself the word
[51:49] the word that's been given to us can
[51:50] save me from myself
[51:52] this word that has been restored in this
[51:54] hour can separate me from me
[51:58] separate the old man from the new man
[52:00] amen separate the old creature
[52:02] amen that was born in sin and shape and
[52:04] iniquity and come through hybridization
[52:06] from the new creature that's born again
[52:08] from the soul
[52:10] praise god that's why we needed this
[52:13] word amen we couldn't do this without a
[52:15] restoration of the word
[52:17] we couldn't achieve to the place he
[52:18] wants us to come amen we couldn't unite
[52:20] with our husband because our husband was
[52:22] bound
[52:24] that's right the word was bound by the
[52:26] nomination of the rivers the holy ghost
[52:28] was bound
[52:29] by these denominational rivers we were
[52:30] separated from our husband we were
[52:32] separated from our mate
[52:34] because of denominational ideas and
[52:36] reasonings and creeds and dogmas
[52:38] but he's been loosed now to what to the
[52:40] head can unite with the body
[52:42] the word comes back to the body and now
[52:44] we live by the word
[52:46] not by anybody else's idea not by our
[52:48] own idea but we live by the word
[52:54] brother says in the message queen of
[52:55] sheba from 1960
[52:59] when god sends a gift to the people and
[53:02] they'll recognize it
[53:03] it's always a golden age
[53:08] don't start thinking because brother bam
[53:10] so many times types he types this
[53:12] golden age that that solomon brought him
[53:15] to with the millennium amen and he ties
[53:17] it but don't forget
[53:18] amen millennium is a place of rest and
[53:21] you can come to a place of rest in your
[53:23] soul
[53:24] amen you can come to this place solomon
[53:26] can bring you to this place
[53:30] and brother bam says it says
[53:34] i'll read it again when god sends a gift
[53:36] to the people that they'll recognize it
[53:38] it always it's always a golden age
[53:42] but when they refuse it there's nothing
[53:44] left but chaos for that generation
[53:47] now listen closely if god had sent the
[53:49] holy spirit in this age for a sign
[53:51] and we reject it there's nothing left
[53:53] but a destruction
[53:55] but if you receive it it's a golden age
[53:58] to you
[54:00] you've come to your golden age amen
[54:02] we're going to the golden age of the
[54:03] millennium we'll be there
[54:05] in flesh amen and bodies oh you know how
[54:08] much i
[54:08] long do you know how much i long to have
[54:11] to have a flesh
[54:12] body to have a spirit and to have a soul
[54:16] that's all in line with no conflict
[54:19] well you and i we don't know what that
[54:21] feels like we have never experienced
[54:22] that before as a complete triune being
[54:25] because we got this war all the time
[54:27] with the inner man and this outer man
[54:29] and they're at war with one another a
[54:31] black dog and a white dog fighting all
[54:32] the time
[54:34] amen and we're never at peace
[54:40] we're constantly subduing the
[54:43] philistines
[54:46] but you know when we come to this
[54:50] great millennium when jesus sets the son
[54:52] of david upon the throne of his father
[54:56] you're going to have a body that is
[54:58] lined up
[54:59] from the soul through the spirit to the
[55:02] flesh
[55:04] you talk about peace peace
[55:08] like you can't imagine i could pick you
[55:11] up
[55:11] send you to the most tranquil island
[55:13] there is in the world
[55:16] with lush vegetables and fruits all
[55:18] around
[55:19] white sandy beaches and perfect climate
[55:22] amen and you still
[55:23] can't get free from yourself
[55:26] you're gonna have rest for a day but
[55:28] then wrong thoughts and wrong desires
[55:29] and selfishness creeps in
[55:31] how can you be free from yourself and
[55:33] then fear and worry and
[55:36] but praise god amen there's a millennium
[55:39] coming amen
[55:40] we'll be free free free we'll know peace
[55:43] like we've never known peace before
[55:45] [Music]
[55:47] when brother branham went beyond the
[55:48] curtain of time amen he left his flesh
[55:51] body back here he stepped into a
[55:52] theophany a word body
[55:54] and he says there's no words that to
[55:56] describe it he says sublime and he's
[55:57] beyond human language
[55:59] amen and he wasn't even completed yet
[56:02] because you're completed in your triune
[56:04] form
[56:06] so it will be even better than that
[56:10] and he couldn't describe that so now
[56:14] when when god sends a gift if we
[56:17] recognize it
[56:18] it's always a golden age so i want to
[56:21] look at that
[56:22] personally for us and for the church
[56:24] solomon bringing them into a golden age
[56:26] amen and this this this release of the
[56:29] word and the holy ghost
[56:30] amen to bring us into a golden age
[56:33] because it is the thing that'll bring us
[56:35] all the way to the millennium it'll
[56:36] bring us to a golden age
[56:39] let's go back to first kings chapter
[56:40] three
[56:42] and look at this gift begin to operate
[56:48] first kings chapter 3
[56:52] and verse 16.
[57:03] all right verse 16.
[57:07] and now i ask one petition of the
[57:10] whoa whoa first kings chapter three not
[57:14] chapter two
[57:15] first kings chapter three verse 16.
[57:19] then came there two women that were
[57:21] harlots and to the king
[57:22] and stood before him and the one woman
[57:25] said my lord
[57:26] i and this woman dwell in one house and
[57:28] i was delivered of a child with her in
[57:30] the house
[57:31] and it came to pass the third day after
[57:33] that i was delivered
[57:35] that this woman was delivered also and
[57:37] we were together there was no stranger
[57:39] with us in the house saved we too in the
[57:41] house
[57:42] and this woman's child died in the night
[57:43] because she overlaid it
[57:45] and she arose at midnight and took my
[57:47] son from beside me while thine handmaid
[57:49] slept and laid it in her bosom and
[57:50] laid her dead child in my bosom and when
[57:53] i rose in the morning to give my child
[57:55] suck behold it was dead
[57:57] but when i had considered it in the
[57:58] morning behold it was not my son which i
[58:00] did bear
[58:01] and the other woman said nay but the
[58:03] living is my son and the dead is thy son
[58:05] and this said no but the dead is thy son
[58:07] and the living is my son
[58:09] thus they spake before the king then
[58:12] said the king
[58:12] the one saith this is my son that liveth
[58:15] and thy son is dead and
[58:16] the other the other saith nay but thy
[58:19] son is the dead and my son is the living
[58:22] and the king said bring me a sword and
[58:23] they brought a sword before the king
[58:26] and the king said divide the living
[58:27] child in two and give half to the one
[58:29] and half to the other then spake the
[58:32] woman whose the living child was and to
[58:33] the king for her bowels yearned upon her
[58:36] son she said oh lord give her the living
[58:38] child and in no wise slay it
[58:40] but the other said let it be neither
[58:42] mine nor thine but divide it
[58:45] then the king answered and said give her
[58:47] the living child
[58:48] and in know why slay it she is the
[58:50] mother thereof
[58:52] and all israel heard of the judgment
[58:53] which the king had judged
[58:55] and they feared the king for they saw
[58:57] that the wisdom of god was in him
[58:58] to do judgment now we look at this and
[59:02] this is the the first record of this
[59:04] judgment that we have after he comes
[59:06] to the throne and when you look at this
[59:08] uh you see the same thing jesus christ
[59:11] was doing
[59:13] he comes and he begins to discern
[59:16] because there's
[59:16] principles and laws with god that are
[59:18] unchanging
[59:20] so solomon is going to discern by the
[59:23] word by the spirit of the word
[59:25] he's been given the spirit of wisdom
[59:26] amen the the word is our wisdom
[59:29] and now he's got that same spirit that's
[59:31] working through him and he looks at
[59:32] these two women
[59:33] amen who both have a child and the
[59:36] argument is over the living child
[59:37] amen and he says one says it's mine the
[59:40] other one says it's hers
[59:41] amen you could attach all kinds of
[59:43] reasonings to this
[59:46] and now today we would do a dna test
[59:50] but in that day solomon could discern
[59:52] just as
[59:53] accurately as a dna test maybe more
[59:55] accurately than a dna test
[59:57] by following the principles of the word
[1:00:01] because god is love
[1:00:05] amen and the woman who bore the child
[1:00:08] amen has a natural love amen that is
[1:00:10] even inferior to god's love but is still
[1:00:13] amen after the same manner it's a love
[1:00:17] and and solomon knows
[1:00:20] that love is self-sacrificing
[1:00:26] see there's a principle that we're going
[1:00:27] to look at through solomon's judgment
[1:00:29] and it's amazing this principle in
[1:00:31] solomon's judgment
[1:00:33] several of his judgments because you'll
[1:00:36] find
[1:00:37] that evil evil is self-serving self-love
[1:00:43] evil self-serving self-love
[1:00:47] but but godliness sacrifices
[1:00:51] for others and sacrifices for god
[1:00:55] so you have two pictures that emerge in
[1:00:57] solomon's judgment
[1:00:58] one is a picture of good and evil
[1:01:01] because he wanted to discern between
[1:01:02] good
[1:01:03] and evil and one of these women was good
[1:01:06] and the other one was
[1:01:08] evil
[1:01:10] she was so evil but but for selfish
[1:01:14] reasons
[1:01:15] she would more she would more rather
[1:01:18] that the child be slain
[1:01:20] than let the original mother have it for
[1:01:22] for her own
[1:01:23] selfishness but the
[1:01:26] the real mother of childhood was because
[1:01:29] of the principle of love
[1:01:31] she was willing to give up her right to
[1:01:33] the child
[1:01:34] to let the child live she was
[1:01:37] self-sacrificing because of love
[1:01:39] she was displaying the nature of good
[1:01:42] and the other woman was displaying the
[1:01:44] nature of evil
[1:01:46] and so solomon was discerning by the
[1:01:48] word because god is love
[1:01:52] right and he would even use an analogy
[1:01:54] of a mother's love sometimes to compare
[1:01:56] his love how much greater it is than a
[1:01:58] mother's love
[1:01:59] in the book of isaiah and so now now
[1:02:01] solomon
[1:02:02] by the word by the gift of discernment
[1:02:04] he's given he's watching
[1:02:06] this woman i mean these two women both
[1:02:08] lay claims to the child
[1:02:09] let's just cut it in half and one woman
[1:02:11] said that's fine with me and the other
[1:02:13] woman says no
[1:02:13] let her have it and he says that's the
[1:02:15] mother the one who has love and is
[1:02:17] willing to sacrifice
[1:02:18] is the good and this is the evil in this
[1:02:21] situation
[1:02:23] see we're faced with good and evil every
[1:02:25] day amen we're making decisions based on
[1:02:27] good and evil every day
[1:02:28] and sometimes we just think well it's
[1:02:30] just me and and i'm just going to make
[1:02:32] this decision
[1:02:32] and not realizing that we're coming to
[1:02:35] the same place we're either going to
[1:02:36] display the word
[1:02:38] or we're going to display self-will it
[1:02:40] goes all the way back to cain and abel
[1:02:42] amen judgment and discernment all the
[1:02:44] way back there cain
[1:02:46] offered what cain wanted to offer abel
[1:02:48] offered what god desired
[1:02:50] and his love for god caused him to wait
[1:02:53] to bring a sacrifice that god wanted but
[1:02:55] cain's love for himself
[1:02:57] caused him to ignore abel amen and offer
[1:02:59] a sacrifice that was pleasing to himself
[1:03:02] and when god comes down and gives him
[1:03:04] the word on it he becomes
[1:03:06] angry
[1:03:09] angry any any any withstands god to his
[1:03:14] face
[1:03:16] and he kills his brother
[1:03:20] you see i hope
[1:03:24] i hope that we're learning how to
[1:03:26] discern ourselves
[1:03:30] i told somebody the other day i said
[1:03:31] this is uh at the beginning of the year
[1:03:33] i said this is 2020. we were talking
[1:03:35] with some brothers 2020
[1:03:36] the year of clear vision perfect
[1:03:39] eyesight 2020.
[1:03:42] you know what i think 2020 means for me
[1:03:45] the ability to see myself
[1:03:49] it's easy it's easy discern that's wrong
[1:03:53] and that's right and
[1:03:54] it's not easy sometimes it's hard
[1:03:57] but i tell you the greatest challenge is
[1:03:59] to see your own backside
[1:04:03] you see everybody else's backside they
[1:04:06] got a backside they got a backside
[1:04:07] but the the greatest challenge is to see
[1:04:10] your own backside
[1:04:12] and the only way you're going to ever
[1:04:14] see your own backside is to find a
[1:04:16] mirror somewhere
[1:04:18] if you find a mirror you can see your
[1:04:20] backside
[1:04:21] and i don't know of any greater mirror
[1:04:23] than the mirror of the word they keep
[1:04:25] checking our backside
[1:04:26] to see if everything is pleasing to the
[1:04:28] lord
[1:04:30] i say let the year 2020 be perfect
[1:04:33] vision for me
[1:04:34] to discern myself because i think that's
[1:04:40] where the real challenge is
[1:04:43] see david fought david fought for the
[1:04:46] church
[1:04:46] he thought to free the church amen from
[1:04:49] outside influences
[1:04:50] he fought to liberate jerusalem
[1:04:54] he fought to liberate jerusalem from the
[1:04:55] jebusites he fought
[1:04:57] amen to to bring back the ark he he
[1:05:00] fought to establish the nation
[1:05:02] he fought amen for the church from all
[1:05:04] outside influences
[1:05:05] but when solomon comes to power
[1:05:07] solomon's not fighting those fights
[1:05:08] anymore
[1:05:09] now solomon's rooting evil out of the
[1:05:12] church
[1:05:14] david was was dispelling evil from all
[1:05:16] around the church
[1:05:17] but solomon comes to a different kind of
[1:05:19] ministry he's not fighting wars on the
[1:05:21] outside
[1:05:22] now solomon is dealing with spirits that
[1:05:24] are embedded in the church
[1:05:25] and have been embedded for generations
[1:05:29] amen when jesus christ comes he does the
[1:05:31] same thing he doesn't fight romans and
[1:05:33] he doesn't fight greeks
[1:05:34] and he doesn't talk about fighting this
[1:05:36] or liberating this jesus starts fighting
[1:05:39] the spirits that are embedded in the
[1:05:41] church
[1:05:43] and when brother branham comes he does
[1:05:45] the same exact thing
[1:05:49] i say god root all the spirits
[1:05:53] out of your jerusalem bring them out
[1:05:57] and cast them out
[1:06:00] so now we see the wisdom of solomon as
[1:06:03] he begins to deal with these issues
[1:06:06] we see what discernment really looks
[1:06:07] like between good and evil
[1:06:10] let's go back to chapter 2 and look at a
[1:06:13] commandment
[1:06:14] i'm going to labor in the word here
[1:06:16] because there's several things we want
[1:06:17] to see in the word so stay right with me
[1:06:18] in the word
[1:06:19] and don't wander away in your mind
[1:06:22] praise god are you with me
[1:06:26] let's do this journey together friends
[1:06:28] first corinthians three
[1:06:30] i'm sorry two and one not corinthians
[1:06:33] kings
[1:06:34] first kings chapter two verse one
[1:06:38] now the days of david drew nigh that he
[1:06:40] should die and he charged solomon his
[1:06:42] son saying
[1:06:43] i go the way of all the earth be thou
[1:06:46] strong therefore and show thyself a man
[1:06:48] and keep the charge of the lord thy god
[1:06:50] to walk in his ways to keep his statutes
[1:06:52] and his commandments and his judgments
[1:06:54] and his testimonies that is as it is
[1:06:56] written in the law moses
[1:06:58] that thou mayest prosper in all that
[1:07:00] thou doest and whithersoever thou
[1:07:02] turnest thyself
[1:07:03] that the lord may continue his word
[1:07:05] which he spoke concerning me
[1:07:07] saying if thy children take heed to
[1:07:09] their way to walk before me in truth
[1:07:11] with all their heart and with all their
[1:07:13] soul there shall not fail thee
[1:07:15] said he a man on the throne of israel
[1:07:18] moreover thou knowest also what joab the
[1:07:20] son of zeruiah
[1:07:22] did to me and what he did to the two
[1:07:24] captains of the host of israel
[1:07:26] unto abner the son of nir and under a
[1:07:28] mesa the son of jether
[1:07:30] whom he slew and shed the blood of war
[1:07:32] and peace and put the blood of war upon
[1:07:34] his girdle
[1:07:35] that was about his loins and his shoes
[1:07:37] that were on his feet
[1:07:39] do therefore according to thy wisdom and
[1:07:41] let not his head go down to the
[1:07:43] grave in peace
[1:07:44] but show kindness unto the sons of
[1:07:47] barzilla
[1:07:48] or zelaya the gileadite and let them be
[1:07:51] of those that eat at thy table for so
[1:07:54] they come to me when i fled because of
[1:07:56] absalom thy brother
[1:07:57] and behold thou has with thee shemia the
[1:08:00] son of gira
[1:08:01] of benjamin a benjamite of beirum
[1:08:04] which cursed me with a grievous curse in
[1:08:06] the day when i went to mahanan
[1:08:09] but he come down to meet me at jordan
[1:08:11] and swear to him i swear to him by the
[1:08:13] lord saying i will not
[1:08:15] put thee to death with the sword now
[1:08:17] therefore hold him not guiltless for
[1:08:19] thou art a wise man
[1:08:20] and know us what thou ought us to do
[1:08:22] unto him but his head
[1:08:25] bring thou down to the grave with blood
[1:08:29] so these are some of the final words of
[1:08:32] david to his son
[1:08:35] what a charge what responsibility was
[1:08:38] given to
[1:08:39] solomon don't forget joab don't forget
[1:08:43] the one who did me good don't forget
[1:08:44] shimmy i see david david
[1:08:48] never judged jerusalem david judged
[1:08:51] all the demons outside and all the
[1:08:53] forces outside
[1:08:54] but now solomon when he comes to the
[1:08:56] throne david is telling him
[1:08:59] don't forget these things need judged
[1:09:02] it wasn't that david didn't know they
[1:09:04] were there david knew it was
[1:09:06] there but it had to be the right time
[1:09:08] because john 5
[1:09:09] 22 says for the father judges no man but
[1:09:12] he hath committed
[1:09:13] all judgment unto the son
[1:09:16] amen because what is this this is a type
[1:09:18] of jesus christ coming
[1:09:20] amen and all judgment is now given to
[1:09:22] the son
[1:09:23] david didn't do it he didn't judge it he
[1:09:25] knew what was right he knew what was
[1:09:26] wrong
[1:09:27] but he's committing judgment to the son
[1:09:29] because solomon is foreshadowing the
[1:09:31] coming of christ
[1:09:34] amen for the father judges no man but
[1:09:36] has committed all judgment to the son
[1:09:37] that all men should honor the son even
[1:09:40] as they honor the father
[1:09:41] he that on earth not the son on earth
[1:09:43] not the father which has sent him
[1:09:46] so now solomon has got to deal
[1:09:51] he's got to bring judgment into the
[1:09:54] church
[1:09:56] david judged outside now we've got to
[1:09:58] bring judgment
[1:09:59] into the church and friends that's what
[1:10:02] jesus christ did
[1:10:04] he brought judgment into the church
[1:10:05] that's what brother branham did he
[1:10:06] brought judgment into the church
[1:10:09] not not fighting i mean not so much
[1:10:12] fighting
[1:10:13] all of these outside influence and
[1:10:14] getting political and fighting abortion
[1:10:16] and
[1:10:17] rallying for life and rallying for this
[1:10:19] and rallying for that
[1:10:20] amen that was that was done through the
[1:10:22] church ages
[1:10:24] but now the son has come amen and
[1:10:27] judgment's been given to the son
[1:10:29] to judge what's going on within the
[1:10:31] church and get everything rooted out of
[1:10:33] the church
[1:10:34] to bring them into a golden age this is
[1:10:36] the precursor for coming to a golden age
[1:10:39] and if we're going to come to a golden
[1:10:40] age in ourselves and we're going to come
[1:10:42] to a golden age on this earth
[1:10:44] amen god has got to have preeminence in
[1:10:46] his church and every old spirit that's
[1:10:48] laying there
[1:10:49] has to be driven out
[1:10:53] who's going to do it there's a greater
[1:10:55] than solomon's here
[1:10:56] if a greater than solomon's here then
[1:10:58] that discernment that judgment that
[1:11:00] ability to judge and move out of the
[1:11:02] church is still here
[1:11:05] first kings chapter one let's go back
[1:11:07] and let's read the story of adonijah
[1:11:09] adonijah is a the second son of david
[1:11:13] absalom has been killed because he
[1:11:14] rebelled against his father
[1:11:16] he's been killed when david told them
[1:11:18] not to kill him
[1:11:19] joab killed him many ways see
[1:11:22] joab has a problem
[1:11:26] joab's a mighty man he's of the family
[1:11:29] of judah
[1:11:31] he's a relative of david
[1:11:34] but he keeps exerting his own self-will
[1:11:37] over the commandments of his king
[1:11:41] that's one spirit that has to be dealt
[1:11:43] with
[1:11:46] but let's look at adonisia adonijah now
[1:11:49] is the second and anonysa being the
[1:11:51] second son after absalom's death
[1:11:54] adonijah is the most likely to become
[1:11:57] king
[1:11:58] if you would look with human reasoning
[1:12:00] and if you look at a natural order and
[1:12:01] progression of things
[1:12:02] you you would not fault anybody for
[1:12:05] assuming that adonijah will be the next
[1:12:07] king
[1:12:08] but the problem is there's going to be a
[1:12:10] movement that takes place and begins to
[1:12:11] move
[1:12:12] and they move ahead of the holy spirit
[1:12:15] they get ahead of what the king's
[1:12:17] commandment and they see the king
[1:12:19] getting old
[1:12:20] they see his health failing they see
[1:12:22] that he's diminishing and he's going to
[1:12:23] pass off this earth soon
[1:12:25] and the most likely reasonable uh
[1:12:27] replacement for him is going to be
[1:12:29] adonijah amen so they begin to bring it
[1:12:32] about before the king gives the
[1:12:33] commandment
[1:12:35] see this is another thing that needs to
[1:12:36] be dealt with in the church amen so many
[1:12:38] times we think well this is the obvious
[1:12:40] next step
[1:12:41] this is the obvious solution this is
[1:12:43] what we should do and
[1:12:44] not waiting for the king to give the
[1:12:48] commandments
[1:12:50] adonis verse 5 then adenizer the son of
[1:12:53] haggath exalted himself saying
[1:12:55] i will be king and he prepared him
[1:12:58] chariots and horsemen and 50 men to run
[1:13:00] before him
[1:13:01] he comes up with his own jubilee 50.
[1:13:05] and his father had not displeased him at
[1:13:07] any time and saying why has thou done so
[1:13:09] and he also was a very goodly man and
[1:13:12] his mother bear him after absalom
[1:13:14] and he conferred with joab the son of
[1:13:17] zariah and with abby athar the priest
[1:13:19] and they followed adonijah helped him
[1:13:22] they following adonai
[1:13:23] helped him but zodak the priest and
[1:13:26] bania the son of jehoiada
[1:13:28] and nathan the prophet and shemia and
[1:13:30] riya the mighty men
[1:13:32] which belonged to david were not with
[1:13:34] adenija
[1:13:37] sometimes it's interesting who gets
[1:13:39] invited and who doesn't
[1:13:43] sometimes it's very telling who gets
[1:13:44] invited and who doesn't
[1:13:48] he he called for there was two priests
[1:13:51] working in this day
[1:13:52] through the through the reign of david
[1:13:54] into solomon there's two kings
[1:13:56] abby athar amen and and
[1:13:59] zodac and there are two priests that are
[1:14:01] working there
[1:14:03] then you have banaya that's head over
[1:14:06] one company of the army and you have
[1:14:08] joab that's that's head over another
[1:14:10] company in the army
[1:14:11] and he gathers and adonijah calls for
[1:14:15] abi athar one of the priests and he
[1:14:17] calls for one of the mighty men one of
[1:14:18] the
[1:14:18] captain of the hosts
[1:14:22] joab and he says come with me and the
[1:14:25] others were not included the others were
[1:14:26] not invited
[1:14:28] solomon was not invited nathan the
[1:14:30] prophet was not invited
[1:14:33] they want to go somewhere without the
[1:14:34] prophet
[1:14:36] i say leave me out of that plan if your
[1:14:38] plan you have to go beyond the prophet
[1:14:41] or without the prophet to come up with
[1:14:42] your plan leave me out of that plan
[1:14:46] without solomon without without
[1:14:49] nathan the prophet without bania amen
[1:14:52] without zodak
[1:14:53] the other priest amen they're going to
[1:14:55] start a movement
[1:14:56] amen without amen including the others
[1:15:01] and they're going to try to take the
[1:15:03] throne amen
[1:15:04] because it's the likely place to do but
[1:15:06] let's just get ahead of the program if
[1:15:07] we get ahead of program we'll get
[1:15:08] everything established before
[1:15:10] david dies amen and everything will be
[1:15:12] fine and we'll be in position
[1:15:14] you see this is a selfish move this has
[1:15:17] nothing to do with the love of the
[1:15:18] nation the love of david the king
[1:15:20] amen the love of god this is all selfish
[1:15:23] selfish
[1:15:24] selfish selfish selfish
[1:15:27] and no doubt they had re religious
[1:15:30] uh uh speech abe arthur the priest was
[1:15:33] there
[1:15:34] no doubt they they would say things like
[1:15:36] oh this will save turmoil
[1:15:38] we won't have trouble and we'll get
[1:15:39] things established amen but it wasn't
[1:15:41] for the king
[1:15:43] it wasn't for the kingdom it wasn't for
[1:15:46] god
[1:15:48] i wonder how many of our plans
[1:15:52] are just for self
[1:15:55] not for the love of god or for the love
[1:15:58] of the kingdom
[1:16:00] or for the love that came
[1:16:05] let's look at chapter 50.
[1:16:10] or verse 50 not chapter 50 verse 50
[1:16:13] chapter 1 verse 50. adonis is planned as
[1:16:18] is unraveled by nathan the prophet and
[1:16:21] bathsheba
[1:16:23] david now appoints solomon to be his
[1:16:25] heir he sends down banai he sends down
[1:16:28] zodak the priest
[1:16:29] and nathan the prophet they anoint him
[1:16:30] they blow the trumpets
[1:16:32] he rides on the king's mule amen and
[1:16:34] they all find out and now adonijah
[1:16:36] becomes afraid he fears for his life
[1:16:38] because now that now that the king had
[1:16:40] appointed the successor
[1:16:41] amen the plan of adonijah all comes
[1:16:44] unraveled
[1:16:45] just as soon as god establishes solomon
[1:16:48] adonis is exposed for what he really is
[1:16:52] a false king a false believer
[1:16:56] verse 50 and adonijah feared because of
[1:16:59] solomon
[1:17:00] and arose and went and caught hold on
[1:17:02] the horns of the altar
[1:17:04] and it was told solomon saying behold
[1:17:06] adonijah feareth king solomon
[1:17:08] for lo he hath caught hold on the horns
[1:17:10] of the altar saying
[1:17:11] let king solomon swear unto me today
[1:17:13] that he will not slay his servant with
[1:17:15] the sword
[1:17:16] and solomon said if he will show himself
[1:17:19] a worthy man
[1:17:20] there shall not a hair of him fall to
[1:17:22] the earth but if wickedness shall be
[1:17:24] found in him
[1:17:25] he shall die this is key words
[1:17:28] so king solomon sent and they brought
[1:17:30] him down from the altar
[1:17:32] and he came and bowed himself to the
[1:17:34] king solomon and solomon said in him
[1:17:36] go to thine house.
[1:17:39] he says he goes and grabs a hold of the
[1:17:41] horns of the altar and says make him
[1:17:43] swear he won't kill me
[1:17:44] he says if he shows himself a worthy man
[1:17:47] nothing will happen to him but if
[1:17:49] wickedness shall be found in him
[1:17:51] he shall die so now the stage is set
[1:17:56] the word is given now we're going to
[1:17:58] find out what's inside of adonijah
[1:18:01] because now the word of the king has
[1:18:03] come the word of the king is sure
[1:18:05] amen now we're going to find out whether
[1:18:07] adonijah
[1:18:08] is good or whether adonijah is evil
[1:18:13] let's let's go over to chapter 2 verse
[1:18:15] 17.
[1:18:19] adonis and now in the next chapter comes
[1:18:21] the bathsheba solomon's mom and he makes
[1:18:23] a request
[1:18:26] and he says in verse 17 and he said
[1:18:28] speak i pray the end of solomon the king
[1:18:30] for he will not say the name that he
[1:18:34] give me a baishag
[1:18:35] the shunammite to wife now abbashag the
[1:18:38] shunamai
[1:18:39] was the fair young virgin they had found
[1:18:41] for david when david's strength was
[1:18:43] failing when he could no longer keep his
[1:18:44] body warm
[1:18:45] and then they found a fair young virgin
[1:18:47] that would be a nurse to him and would
[1:18:48] lie with him and give him heat and
[1:18:50] cherish him and care for him
[1:18:52] and it says at the end of that passage
[1:18:54] it says and he knew her not
[1:18:55] she remained the king's virgin and then
[1:18:58] she was there to cherish him and care
[1:18:59] for him
[1:19:00] and now ambassador comes to bathsheba
[1:19:02] and he says because the king won't tell
[1:19:04] you no
[1:19:06] i wonder if this was such a great idea
[1:19:09] why didn't he go to the king himself
[1:19:14] if it was such a noble plan if it was
[1:19:16] such a good idea
[1:19:17] why does he go through a back door and
[1:19:20] not come through the front door
[1:19:22] and go through the back door of
[1:19:23] bathsheba's mother and says now if
[1:19:25] you'll ask
[1:19:26] he won't tell you no and and i will get
[1:19:29] this thing that i desire
[1:19:30] i will accomplish my plan amen it's just
[1:19:33] like the serpent if the serpent had a
[1:19:34] good idea why didn't he tell it to adam
[1:19:38] why did he have to tell it to the woman
[1:19:40] amen why
[1:19:41] why could he just come through the front
[1:19:43] door and tell adam say adam this is a
[1:19:45] great idea i understand
[1:19:46] you should do this this and this but no
[1:19:48] through subtility he began to beguile
[1:19:50] seduce
[1:19:51] amen the woman because he knew it was an
[1:19:53] evil plan
[1:19:55] and adonison now comes through the back
[1:19:57] door not through the front door
[1:19:59] amen you see the same thing happened in
[1:20:02] churches
[1:20:03] all the time if it's such a good idea
[1:20:07] just tell the pastor
[1:20:12] amen don't try to talk to his wife and
[1:20:15] don't try to talk to his friend
[1:20:18] if it's a great idea just talk to
[1:20:20] whoever the idea is for if it's a great
[1:20:21] idea for this family
[1:20:23] don't tell the wife tell the husband
[1:20:26] do you think it would be good for them
[1:20:28] and you think it'd be a great idea and
[1:20:29] you think it would bless their home
[1:20:30] i may just go through the front door not
[1:20:32] the side door
[1:20:35] it saves us a lot of trouble sometimes
[1:20:37] our approach exposes our motives
[1:20:41] you see this is the discernment that
[1:20:43] solomon has
[1:20:44] he's discerning by the word amen so many
[1:20:47] times we get confused by
[1:20:49] words that are said and sometimes we
[1:20:51] need to forget the words and look at the
[1:20:52] action
[1:20:54] what was the approach was it through
[1:20:55] headship and did it come the right way
[1:20:58] because sometimes the approach displays
[1:21:01] the motive
[1:21:04] instead of adam isaac going up and
[1:21:06] asking his dad can i be king next
[1:21:11] he wakes those dead as weak and sick and
[1:21:13] in bed amen and his strength is failing
[1:21:15] amen and he then he grabs himself horses
[1:21:18] and chariots and 50 men and he gets
[1:21:19] a zone or abby athar and he gets joab
[1:21:22] and he says come on i'm going to be king
[1:21:24] and let's go
[1:21:24] and let's just do this if it was such a
[1:21:26] great idea and you were sure you're the
[1:21:28] next in line
[1:21:29] why not go ask your dad the reason he
[1:21:32] didn't go ask david is because he wasn't
[1:21:34] sure what david would say
[1:21:35] and he wanted to accomplish his own will
[1:21:38] because
[1:21:38] his will mattered more than the kingdom
[1:21:41] and matter more than the will of the
[1:21:42] king
[1:21:45] i hope we're getting 20 20 vision don't
[1:21:48] put this on anybody else put it right
[1:21:49] here
[1:21:50] say what's my motive what's my objective
[1:21:52] what's my approach
[1:21:56] is it honest and straightforward and
[1:21:58] straight up
[1:21:59] or is there something am i afraid to go
[1:22:01] right to the front door
[1:22:04] if i am why why am i afraid to go ask
[1:22:07] this person or talk to this man and talk
[1:22:09] to why why am i trying to talk to this
[1:22:11] one and this one on the side
[1:22:15] i would check your motive first kings 2
[1:22:19] and 22.
[1:22:26] and king solomon answered and said unto
[1:22:28] his mother
[1:22:30] she she asked him she comes to him and
[1:22:31] asked for adani and king solomon
[1:22:33] answered and said unto his mother
[1:22:35] and why does thou ask shag the
[1:22:37] shunammite for adonisia
[1:22:39] good question what do you have to do
[1:22:42] with any of this why are you asking me
[1:22:44] to give a bishop to him right out from
[1:22:47] the bat he goes shady deal
[1:22:49] shady deal shady deal
[1:22:52] do you know how many shady deals i fell
[1:22:54] for because i didn't recognize that the
[1:22:55] approach was wrong
[1:22:57] and i got caught up in some nonsense
[1:22:59] because the approach wasn't right
[1:23:04] oh praise god let's keep going
[1:23:08] solomon answered and said to his mother
[1:23:09] and why does thou has a by shaq the
[1:23:11] shunam my friend and niger
[1:23:12] ask for him the kingdom also for he is
[1:23:14] my elder brother
[1:23:15] even for him and for abe arthur the
[1:23:17] priest and for joab the son of zariah
[1:23:20] then king solomon swear by the lord
[1:23:22] saying god do so to me and more also if
[1:23:24] adagi have not spoken this word against
[1:23:27] his own
[1:23:28] life now therefore as the lord liveth
[1:23:31] which hath established me and set me on
[1:23:33] the throne
[1:23:34] of david my father and who hath made me
[1:23:37] a house as he promised adonai shall be
[1:23:39] put to death this day
[1:23:41] and king solomon sent by the hand of
[1:23:43] banaya the son of jehoiada
[1:23:45] and he fell upon him that he died
[1:23:50] solomon gave his word if you're found an
[1:23:53] upright man
[1:23:54] nothing will happen but the wickedness
[1:23:56] be found in you you'll die
[1:23:57] that day so that means adonijah had
[1:24:01] no good intentions with this woman
[1:24:04] adam niger there was another plan
[1:24:07] because he says
[1:24:08] why do you ask the woman you might as
[1:24:09] well just ask for the kingdom
[1:24:12] there was something else murking
[1:24:14] underneath amen there was a reason he
[1:24:16] came to his mother not to him
[1:24:18] there's a reason he asked for the king's
[1:24:20] virgin amen so that so that he could sow
[1:24:22] seed into the king's virgin
[1:24:25] going after the virgin amen that that
[1:24:27] virgin was reserved for the king of
[1:24:29] israel and now
[1:24:30] solomon was the king of israel what
[1:24:31] would happen if adonijah took that
[1:24:33] virgin
[1:24:34] so you might as well ask for abathur you
[1:24:36] might as well you might as well hand
[1:24:37] over the kingdom
[1:24:38] there's something fishy going on there's
[1:24:40] wickedness in
[1:24:42] adonisia and i can tell
[1:24:45] by his approach he doesn't come the
[1:24:48] right way
[1:24:52] amen a lot of trouble in our lives would
[1:24:55] stop if we just watch
[1:24:57] for how people approach do they come the
[1:24:59] right way
[1:25:00] they come in honor and respect and
[1:25:03] reverence
[1:25:03] do they come through the order of
[1:25:05] headship
[1:25:07] so many so many young men try to
[1:25:10] start a relationship with a young lady
[1:25:12] and they don't come and they don't come
[1:25:14] down
[1:25:14] god's order down through headship and
[1:25:16] speak to her father amen
[1:25:18] and and if you're a wise dad when you
[1:25:20] find out you're not going to say well
[1:25:22] you know he's a good boy
[1:25:23] he should have asked me he didn't it was
[1:25:24] an oversight we'll let it go there's a
[1:25:26] reason he didn't ask you brother
[1:25:28] have discernment in the word and open
[1:25:30] your eyes and say something's going on
[1:25:32] here
[1:25:34] that i don't like praise god
[1:25:37] hey i'll just give a disclosure right
[1:25:39] now i'm not talking about anything that
[1:25:41] i know is going on
[1:25:44] and the church in your life but i may be
[1:25:47] talking about something that's going on
[1:25:49] i can't say
[1:25:49] i cannot say i'm not talking about
[1:25:51] anything that's going on
[1:25:53] but i can say i'm talking about anything
[1:25:54] that i know is going on
[1:25:56] because the word is still a discerner
[1:25:59] and don't miss it friends
[1:26:01] i have no knowledge of anything i am not
[1:26:04] speaking this because i have no
[1:26:05] knowledge of anything that's going on
[1:26:06] this is what god laid on my heart so
[1:26:08] open your eyes and open your ears
[1:26:10] because the word is a discerner
[1:26:12] and you may not need this word today but
[1:26:14] you might need it tomorrow
[1:26:20] amen
[1:26:22] so so now because wickedness was found
[1:26:26] in adonisia
[1:26:27] he had the wrong approach he had the
[1:26:28] wrong desires we didn't want the girl he
[1:26:30] wanted the kingdom
[1:26:32] and solomon could tell his intentions
[1:26:35] were evil because of his approach
[1:26:38] and so now he lost his life
[1:26:43] and what was that that was righteous
[1:26:45] discernment and righteous judgment
[1:26:48] what was solomon purging out of the
[1:26:50] church he was getting out this
[1:26:53] conniving subtle serpent spirit
[1:26:57] that would come and speak to the woman
[1:26:59] again to try
[1:27:01] to take over authority and hedge it what
[1:27:04] did the serpent do what did the devil do
[1:27:05] through the serpent
[1:27:06] he come to the woman and seduced the
[1:27:08] woman so that he could set as a king and
[1:27:10] god of this evil age on this planet
[1:27:13] he took it he usurped it amen he sowed
[1:27:15] his seed
[1:27:16] in the king's virgin first it's the same
[1:27:20] thing
[1:27:20] amen if we just look at what's happened
[1:27:22] what's happened will happen again
[1:27:23] we may change the circumstances it may
[1:27:25] change the names but it's the same thing
[1:27:27] that happened
[1:27:27] in the garden of eden the same thing
[1:27:29] that happened with cain and abel the
[1:27:31] same thing that happened
[1:27:32] in the early church is happening now
[1:27:34] god's given us a word he's given us his
[1:27:36] whole word to open our eyes and have
[1:27:37] discernment
[1:27:41] let's look at abe ethar in verse 26
[1:27:44] same chapter and unto abe
[1:27:47] athar the priests said the king get thee
[1:27:50] to anathoth
[1:27:51] thy unto thine own fields for thou art
[1:27:54] worthy of death
[1:27:55] but i will not at this time put thee to
[1:27:57] death because thou bearest the ark of
[1:27:59] the lord
[1:28:00] god bear the ark of the lord god before
[1:28:03] david my father
[1:28:04] and because thou has been afflicted and
[1:28:06] all wherein my father was afflicted
[1:28:08] so solomon thrust out abe athar from
[1:28:10] being priest unto the lord
[1:28:12] that he might fulfill the word of the
[1:28:14] lord which he spake concerning the house
[1:28:16] of eli
[1:28:17] and shiloh all of a sudden
[1:28:22] this judgment doesn't have really it's
[1:28:24] not just based off the events that's
[1:28:26] taking place in solomon's life
[1:28:28] around solomon this goes all the way
[1:28:30] back to eli's
[1:28:32] sins for not taking care of his sons
[1:28:35] back in the days of samuel
[1:28:36] and there was a prophecy came forth amen
[1:28:38] from samuel that said
[1:28:40] amen the the priesthood will be taken
[1:28:42] from thy house
[1:28:44] and there were two priests in the days
[1:28:45] of david abe athar
[1:28:47] amen which was at the house of eli aaron
[1:28:50] had four sons and the priesthood was
[1:28:52] given to aaron
[1:28:53] but abihu and nadab they they offered
[1:28:56] strange fire before the lord and he sent
[1:28:58] down fire and killed them immediately
[1:28:59] in the inauguration of the temple so
[1:29:01] there's only two sons left eleazar the
[1:29:03] elder
[1:29:04] and then the younger i don't remember
[1:29:05] his name
[1:29:07] forgive me eliezer was the one that the
[1:29:11] high priesthood was given to eliezer
[1:29:13] and zodak zadok is as a
[1:29:17] descendant of eliezer he is the rightful
[1:29:19] high priest
[1:29:20] but somehow it got mixed up and went
[1:29:22] through eli amen but eli
[1:29:25] failed to reign in his sons and there
[1:29:26] was a prophecy said it will be stripped
[1:29:28] from your house
[1:29:28] and where is it going to go back it's
[1:29:30] going to go back to the house of eleazar
[1:29:33] god under the ministry of solomon is
[1:29:35] correcting
[1:29:36] everything that's crossed up and wrong
[1:29:39] amen he's bringing it all back to the
[1:29:41] order it should be
[1:29:42] this is church order this is the way it
[1:29:44] should be this is what a true priesthood
[1:29:46] is
[1:29:47] you're out of position you're not even a
[1:29:48] cold man
[1:29:50] you're not called to that position what
[1:29:52] is the ministry of solomon doing
[1:29:54] so the ministry of solomon is correcting
[1:29:56] the priesthood
[1:29:59] and bringing it back to the way it
[1:30:01] should be where it's not
[1:30:03] uh it's not a succession amen it's not
[1:30:06] popularity
[1:30:07] it's not by education but it's by god
[1:30:09] called men god placed men
[1:30:12] solomon is correcting the priesthood
[1:30:16] and a.b athar you think abathar didn't
[1:30:19] know this
[1:30:20] do you think there wasn't any
[1:30:21] competition between him and zadok
[1:30:23] amen he was invited to the feast of
[1:30:25] adonijah
[1:30:26] zadok was not do you think abby athar
[1:30:29] didn't realize that he didn't know
[1:30:31] that zadok wasn't invited why didn't he
[1:30:33] ask the question what about zadok he's
[1:30:34] my buddy he's my partner we're in this
[1:30:36] thing together we're both priests
[1:30:39] we're both the priests of david hey if
[1:30:40] we're going to do anything right let's
[1:30:42] do it together
[1:30:44] no why was he content to go along when
[1:30:46] zadok was not included it's because he
[1:30:48] wanted to be the high priest
[1:30:50] he wanted the authority he wanted the
[1:30:52] position he wanted to hold on
[1:30:54] amen even though there's a prophecy that
[1:30:55] he doesn't have a right to it
[1:30:59] in the scriptures he doesn't have a
[1:31:00] right to it and by the prophecy of
[1:31:01] samuel doesn't have a right to it
[1:31:03] so he's trying to assert his own will
[1:31:06] over the will and the word of god
[1:31:08] because the word is already said it's
[1:31:09] eleazar and he already said
[1:31:12] eli will be stripped of the priesthood
[1:31:16] see we still try to operate in old
[1:31:19] hangover things that got that way
[1:31:21] through the church ages
[1:31:25] but there's a greater than solomon here
[1:31:26] is to right every wrong
[1:31:28] whatever got mixed up in the church ages
[1:31:30] there's a greater than solomon here to
[1:31:32] straighten it back out
[1:31:34] straighten back out the offices
[1:31:35] straighten out the position straighten
[1:31:37] out the gifts
[1:31:39] whatever got crisscrossed and got off
[1:31:41] the word amen there's a ministry
[1:31:43] of a judge here to discern by the word
[1:31:46] and bring everything back the way it's
[1:31:47] supposed to be
[1:31:50] amen friends we are the most blessed
[1:31:53] people in the world to have this message
[1:31:55] if we would just let this message
[1:31:56] cut us we would be shaped right if we
[1:31:59] would just die to self-will
[1:32:01] and the selfishness and try to have a
[1:32:03] position and hold on to something and be
[1:32:05] somebody
[1:32:05] if we could just die to all of that and
[1:32:07] let that word cut us
[1:32:08] it'll move us right into the position
[1:32:10] where we belong
[1:32:13] our approach amen sometimes what we side
[1:32:17] with
[1:32:18] what abe ather sided with when he sided
[1:32:21] with adonijah adenija excluded zadok
[1:32:24] and in the exclusion it automatically
[1:32:27] exalted abiather over zadok and that's
[1:32:29] what he really wanted
[1:32:33] but the way up is
[1:32:38] zadok stayed with david in his failing
[1:32:41] health
[1:32:42] in his weakness and his infirmity and
[1:32:45] the uncertainty of what will happen next
[1:32:47] and the unknowing of who will be the
[1:32:49] next king zadok stayed there
[1:32:53] and all the wrongs in the priesthood
[1:32:54] were righted by solomon
[1:32:58] praise god
[1:33:02] i hope my point is coming clear stay
[1:33:05] with the word regardless of what our
[1:33:08] fathers did
[1:33:09] regardless of what hungover traditions
[1:33:12] come from the church ages and blended
[1:33:13] itself in among
[1:33:14] regard forget it all check it back with
[1:33:17] the word and let it greater than solomon
[1:33:18] discern now
[1:33:22] let's look at joab
[1:33:26] next verse 28 chapter 228
[1:33:29] then kinds came to joab for joab had
[1:33:32] turned after adonijah
[1:33:34] though he turned not after absalom and
[1:33:36] job fled into the tabernacle of the lord
[1:33:38] and caught hold on the horns of the
[1:33:40] altar
[1:33:41] and it was told to king solomon that job
[1:33:43] was fled into the tabernacle
[1:33:45] of the lord and behold he is by the
[1:33:47] altar
[1:33:48] then solomon sent bania the son of
[1:33:50] jehoiada saying
[1:33:51] go fall upon him now there's a couple
[1:33:55] things that i want to look at here
[1:33:57] joab joab was i believe a nephew
[1:34:01] of david and joab was one of the mighty
[1:34:04] men of david
[1:34:05] he was a captain over the host but job
[1:34:07] had a problem
[1:34:09] and joab's problem was he was willing to
[1:34:12] kill the righteous line
[1:34:14] to keep himself in position
[1:34:17] he killed abner when abner abner had
[1:34:20] separated amen with the son of saul they
[1:34:22] thought they were going to start another
[1:34:23] kingdom and the kingdom was divided
[1:34:25] and david just had judah and benjamin
[1:34:27] and they had the other team kingdoms
[1:34:28] when they found out that that king
[1:34:30] wasn't god's plan abner
[1:34:32] was going to bring peace and he was
[1:34:34] going to bring israel back to david
[1:34:36] and they had an agreement for peace and
[1:34:38] part of that david was going to let
[1:34:39] abner be
[1:34:40] the captain of the host and joab didn't
[1:34:44] like this because abner had killed his
[1:34:45] brother
[1:34:48] and he had vengeance on his heart and he
[1:34:51] had his own position to protect
[1:34:54] and it wasn't love for the king it
[1:34:56] wasn't love for the people
[1:34:58] or love for god it was love for himself
[1:35:02] and in a time of peace when there was an
[1:35:04] accord of peace
[1:35:05] when they were coming together in
[1:35:06] peaceful terms he
[1:35:08] he enticed abner to the side of the gate
[1:35:12] and slew him there
[1:35:16] then when when uh
[1:35:19] when absalom rebelled against david
[1:35:22] absalom had taken
[1:35:23] a part of judah away a mesa another one
[1:35:26] of the
[1:35:27] the nephew cousins they they were part
[1:35:29] of the captain of the host there
[1:35:31] and david promised him that if you when
[1:35:34] you come back if you be joined back to
[1:35:36] me
[1:35:36] you'll be captain of the host so what
[1:35:39] did job do
[1:35:40] when he come amen they were they were
[1:35:42] routing the enemy amen when they come
[1:35:44] he come up to him with a hidden sword
[1:35:47] underneath his mantle
[1:35:48] and he grabbed him by the beard to kiss
[1:35:50] him while he was kissing he took the
[1:35:52] sword and smote it through his fifth rib
[1:35:55] through deception
[1:35:57] through deceit he says
[1:36:02] jesus looked at judas and says thou
[1:36:05] betrayus the son of man with a kiss
[1:36:08] you act like my friend he says how are
[1:36:10] you my friend my brother how are you my
[1:36:12] brothers what he said before he grabbed
[1:36:13] by the beard and kissed him
[1:36:16] pretending to be a brother pretending to
[1:36:18] come in peace
[1:36:21] and what did he want he wanted to hold
[1:36:23] on to his position
[1:36:25] and he wanted vengeance
[1:36:29] see that's why david said don't forget
[1:36:33] joab
[1:36:35] don't forget what i didn't judge him it
[1:36:37] wasn't part of my administration to
[1:36:38] judge him i've given all judgment to the
[1:36:40] son but now you're coming on the throne
[1:36:42] now you judge these things that have
[1:36:43] been hanging on
[1:36:46] it's been too much strife and too much
[1:36:48] back fighting and too much acting like a
[1:36:50] friend and then going and talking about
[1:36:52] that person
[1:36:52] because if you destroy their influence
[1:36:54] it's the same as murder
[1:36:58] murder so brother branham said murder if
[1:37:01] you destroy their influence
[1:37:02] we'll act like a friend act like a
[1:37:03] brother we'll hug that shake hand and go
[1:37:05] off and tell everybody all the
[1:37:06] evil things this brother's done
[1:37:09] destroying their influence
[1:37:11] the same as murder but i tell you
[1:37:13] there's a greater than solomon that's
[1:37:14] here
[1:37:16] and he's judging those things and that's
[1:37:17] thing's not going to stay in the church
[1:37:19] friends don't greet me with a kiss and
[1:37:22] stab me under the fifth rib with your
[1:37:24] hidden sword
[1:37:27] amen if you don't want to kiss me don't
[1:37:29] kiss me just don't kill me
[1:37:32] don't destroy the influence don't speak
[1:37:35] evil of one another
[1:37:37] amen just because that they're promised
[1:37:40] a position that you want to hold on to
[1:37:43] just because the king delights in them
[1:37:46] amen and you want the kingdom to delight
[1:37:47] in you
[1:37:48] just because you're angry about
[1:37:49] something that happened years ago
[1:37:51] amen you stick with the word
[1:37:54] no strife no backbiting no contention in
[1:37:57] the church
[1:37:58] but but fervent love for one another
[1:38:02] joab forgot that day in sunday school he
[1:38:04] didn't show up for that bible verse
[1:38:07] that you have fervent love for one
[1:38:08] another
[1:38:10] so joab now see
[1:38:14] man always destroys himself he sends
[1:38:17] banaya
[1:38:18] over to fall on him banaya is always
[1:38:21] there with the king
[1:38:23] banaya is one of those mighty men one of
[1:38:24] those mighty warriors
[1:38:26] and and one thing i like about banaya if
[1:38:28] you read about banaya in the scriptures
[1:38:31] benign never does anything unless the
[1:38:33] king tells him to do it
[1:38:37] banaya is is there and he says go follow
[1:38:41] night of niger he goes and kills adam
[1:38:42] nigel not because he wanted to kill adam
[1:38:44] niger but because the king told him to
[1:38:47] joab was told not to kill absalom he did
[1:38:50] because he wanted to
[1:38:52] he was not supposed to kill abner he's
[1:38:53] not supposed to kill a mess he did it
[1:38:55] because
[1:38:55] he wanted to stay on top
[1:38:59] so why does somebody kill another
[1:39:00] person's influence only because they
[1:39:03] want to stay on top
[1:39:08] so now joab he's got a hold of the horns
[1:39:11] of the altar
[1:39:12] when adonijah had the hold of the horns
[1:39:14] of the altar amen so when he asked for
[1:39:16] mercy solomon granted him mercy
[1:39:19] and said if you be found a worthy man
[1:39:21] you'll be fine but if the day
[1:39:22] evil is found in you amen so he set up
[1:39:25] the guidelines to the word
[1:39:26] adonisja went outside the word and
[1:39:28] according to the word
[1:39:30] he had to die but look at job
[1:39:34] now now solomon has to bring judgment to
[1:39:37] joe adam
[1:39:38] has to but he's got to wait because he's
[1:39:41] got to pass
[1:39:41] judgment the right way just like when
[1:39:44] jesus wanted to let this harlot go this
[1:39:46] woman caught an adulterer he's got to do
[1:39:48] it the right way
[1:39:50] so now joab comes banaya
[1:39:54] goes to fall upon him verse 30 and
[1:39:56] banaya come to the tabernacle of the
[1:39:58] lord and said unto him
[1:39:59] thus saith the king come forth and he
[1:40:02] said nay
[1:40:02] but i will die here and baniya brought
[1:40:05] the king word again
[1:40:06] saying thus said joab and thus he
[1:40:08] answered me
[1:40:11] listen friends what else is solomon
[1:40:14] supposed to do
[1:40:16] he said come on out but he says no
[1:40:19] i'll die here
[1:40:23] he spoke his own judgment and he spoke
[1:40:25] his own hurt
[1:40:29] joab thought he could hide in the church
[1:40:35] joab thought that he could he could
[1:40:38] speak evil of brothers that he could
[1:40:39] slay and
[1:40:40] kill and ruin the influence of other men
[1:40:43] of god that are leading host in the army
[1:40:45] of god
[1:40:45] and he thought that he could speak evil
[1:40:47] this and evil that one and he could hide
[1:40:49] in the church
[1:40:50] amen but king solomon the prince of
[1:40:52] peace said you slay him
[1:40:54] in the church
[1:40:57] you know how many people are spiritually
[1:40:59] dead in the church
[1:41:01] they've been slain at the very altar
[1:41:03] they're trying to hold on to
[1:41:04] because they're not repenting for
[1:41:06] anything they're hiding
[1:41:08] they think they're hiding from judgment
[1:41:10] they think they're hiding out and that
[1:41:12] they won't be destroyed as long as i'm
[1:41:13] here holding on to the orders you can't
[1:41:15] kill me here
[1:41:16] but you can be slain anywhere by the
[1:41:19] sword of the lord
[1:41:23] he didn't he didn't believe amen because
[1:41:25] adonijah when he grabbed ahold of the
[1:41:27] horns of the altar found mercy but joab
[1:41:29] didn't ask for mercy
[1:41:30] job refused the commandment of the king
[1:41:32] and said i'll die here
[1:41:33] thinking that he could be safe as long
[1:41:35] as i hid in church and as long as i say
[1:41:37] i believe the message
[1:41:38] and as long as i hold on to the horns of
[1:41:40] the altar god won't kill me here and
[1:41:42] you've
[1:41:43] spoken your own destruction you'll be
[1:41:45] slayed by the word and spiritually die
[1:41:48] right in the message church
[1:41:52] you can't hide from god you can't hide
[1:41:54] from the greater the solomon that's here
[1:41:56] the word is slaying your own words will
[1:41:58] slay you
[1:42:09] so joe banaya goes and tells him said
[1:42:12] this is what job said he won't come he
[1:42:13] said he'll die there
[1:42:15] and the king said unto him do as he hath
[1:42:17] said and fall upon him and bury him
[1:42:20] that thou mayest take away the innocent
[1:42:22] blood which job shed for me
[1:42:24] from the house of my father and the lord
[1:42:26] shall return his blood upon his own head
[1:42:28] who fell upon two men more righteous and
[1:42:31] better than he
[1:42:32] and slew them with the sword my father
[1:42:34] david not knowing thereof to wit
[1:42:35] abner the son of nur captain of the host
[1:42:38] of israel mesa
[1:42:39] the son of jether captain of the host of
[1:42:41] judah
[1:42:42] their blood shall therefore return upon
[1:42:44] the head of joab
[1:42:45] and upon the head of his seed forever
[1:42:47] but upon david and upon his seed and
[1:42:49] upon his house
[1:42:50] and upon his throne shall there be peace
[1:42:52] forever
[1:42:54] from the lord so banaya the son of
[1:42:56] jehoiada
[1:42:57] went up and fell upon him he slew him
[1:42:59] and he was buried
[1:43:01] in his own house in the wilderness
[1:43:04] and the king put banaya the son of
[1:43:06] jehoiada in his room over the host
[1:43:08] and zadok the priest did the king put in
[1:43:10] the room of abiathar
[1:43:14] what did banaya do
[1:43:18] to get joab's position
[1:43:21] he didn't do what joab did to hold on to
[1:43:23] it
[1:43:25] joab killed job deceived
[1:43:28] joab tricked his brothers in thinking
[1:43:31] they were friends and then went around
[1:43:33] and spoke evil of them
[1:43:34] and ruined their influence see i'm
[1:43:36] bringing it to today
[1:43:38] we don't want to leave it there we want
[1:43:40] to bring it today all these things were
[1:43:41] written for our examples
[1:43:46] but what did banaya do all he did was
[1:43:49] obey solomon
[1:43:51] when solomon said go he went when psalms
[1:43:53] don't go he didn't go
[1:43:54] he didn't use his own mind he didn't
[1:43:56] exert his own will he didn't seek for a
[1:43:58] position
[1:43:59] he just stayed put he stayed with david
[1:44:01] like zadok stayed with david and david's
[1:44:03] diminishing
[1:44:04] when david was going down he stayed put
[1:44:07] when david had no more strength he
[1:44:08] stayed put
[1:44:09] when there was turmoil in the kingdom he
[1:44:10] stayed put waiting for the king to tell
[1:44:13] him what to do
[1:44:16] sometimes what we need to do friends is
[1:44:18] nothing
[1:44:19] sometimes what we need to do when things
[1:44:20] are falling apart around us it looks
[1:44:22] like weakness and it looks like things
[1:44:23] are going downhill
[1:44:24] what we need to do is stay put and wait
[1:44:26] for the king to tell us what to do
[1:44:29] because there is a greater than solomon
[1:44:31] here and he will not instruct us
[1:44:33] outside of his word whatever he tells us
[1:44:35] to do will be right in line with his
[1:44:37] word
[1:44:41] let's look at one more you guys with me
[1:44:43] for another one
[1:44:45] praise god shimmy i remember
[1:44:48] he's purging the church for spirits this
[1:44:51] is judgment in the house of the lord
[1:44:53] these are israelites that he's judging
[1:44:55] now and casting out we can bring this
[1:44:57] right to ourselves
[1:45:00] it is not those nasty philistines those
[1:45:01] idolaters out there there's people who
[1:45:03] don't believe in god
[1:45:04] no this is the chosen people and he's
[1:45:07] got to root this out of them
[1:45:09] and we're the chosen of god he's got to
[1:45:11] root this out of us friends
[1:45:13] so that we can come to the golden age
[1:45:15] this is the precursor to coming to the
[1:45:17] golden age they would never come to the
[1:45:18] golden age with these spirits hanging
[1:45:20] around the church
[1:45:22] they have to be rooted out and if we're
[1:45:24] going to come to the golden age these
[1:45:25] things have to be rooted out of
[1:45:27] us a love for position a desire to get
[1:45:29] ahead of god
[1:45:30] amen a root of bitterness towards our
[1:45:33] brothers
[1:45:35] are self-willed to do our own thing it's
[1:45:37] got to get out of us friends
[1:45:38] until we can be like bania and just stay
[1:45:40] put the king says do that do it
[1:45:43] no matter how unpleasant the task it
[1:45:45] wasn't a pleasant task binay was sent on
[1:45:47] to go into the temple and get a man
[1:45:49] who's holding on to the horns of the
[1:45:51] altar and slay him there
[1:45:54] do you know how difficult a task that
[1:45:55] would have been the respect that they
[1:45:57] had
[1:45:58] for the house of god the respect that he
[1:46:01] had
[1:46:01] for job they had fought battles together
[1:46:03] side by side
[1:46:06] but he did what his king told him to do
[1:46:08] not more
[1:46:10] not less
[1:46:13] first kings chapter 2 verse 36
[1:46:18] and the king sent and called for
[1:46:20] shemitah and said unto him
[1:46:22] build thee a house in jerusalem and
[1:46:23] dwell there and go not
[1:46:25] fence in each other shimmy i was the one
[1:46:27] that when david
[1:46:28] ran from jerusalem because absalom was
[1:46:31] coming and david didn't run from
[1:46:32] jerusalem because he feared absalom
[1:46:34] david ran from jerusalem to save the
[1:46:36] inhabitants of jerusalem
[1:46:38] and he ran away and while he was running
[1:46:41] shimmy i came
[1:46:42] and shimaya happens to be of the family
[1:46:45] of the household of saul
[1:46:47] and so he's not real happy about david
[1:46:50] being king because if it had followed in
[1:46:52] saul's house
[1:46:53] he would have a position see he's not
[1:46:56] upset about david being david he's upset
[1:46:59] about david's position
[1:47:00] putting him out of his position
[1:47:03] all of these things that are being
[1:47:05] judged they all have a common thread
[1:47:08] self-will self-love every one of them
[1:47:11] all the way back to the two harlots they
[1:47:13] all have the same theme
[1:47:15] self-will self-love what are we dying to
[1:47:19] ourselves what's our greatest enemy
[1:47:23] self who do we have to die to self self
[1:47:26] will
[1:47:26] self love has got to be rooted out of
[1:47:30] this church it's got to be rooted out of
[1:47:32] this jerusalem
[1:47:34] remember we started the year because i
[1:47:36] felt like the lord impressed us
[1:47:37] on jerusalem judea samara the uttermost
[1:47:40] parts of the earth
[1:47:40] and taking jerusalem as us that we can't
[1:47:43] we've got to be witnesses within
[1:47:44] ourselves we've got to be the real deal
[1:47:46] no hypocrites genuine believers
[1:47:49] then our families and then our local
[1:47:50] church and then we can spread out
[1:47:53] and boy did god do a good job of helping
[1:47:55] us keep that commitment
[1:47:58] stuck us in our homes for a while shut
[1:48:00] down travel
[1:48:04] so now these things have to be rooted
[1:48:06] out of jerusalem
[1:48:09] we got to have 20 20 vision
[1:48:15] oh boy i got a problem
[1:48:20] that's what the word's supposed to do
[1:48:26] chapter 2 verse 36.
[1:48:30] we read 36 let's go 37 first shall be
[1:48:33] that on the day thou goest out
[1:48:35] and passes over the brook kedron thou
[1:48:38] shalt know for certain that thou shalt
[1:48:39] surely die
[1:48:40] thy blood shall be upon thine own head
[1:48:42] and shimmy said unto the king that
[1:48:44] saying is good as my lord the king hath
[1:48:47] said
[1:48:47] so will thy servant do and shed me i
[1:48:49] dwelt in jerusalem many days
[1:48:51] i this is probably my favorite of all of
[1:48:54] them
[1:48:55] shimmy i when when david's down and when
[1:48:58] david strong
[1:48:59] shimmy i says nothing i'm telling your
[1:49:02] friends you'll find a shimmy eye in your
[1:49:04] life sometime
[1:49:06] when everything's going wrong right
[1:49:07] nobody says anything but when things go
[1:49:09] bad
[1:49:09] shimaya shows up to kick dust on you and
[1:49:11] throw stones at you
[1:49:12] and tell you you're wrong it's like
[1:49:16] if you love me why didn't you come tell
[1:49:17] me i was wrong back when everything was
[1:49:19] fine
[1:49:21] but why do you wait till everything goes
[1:49:22] wrong to say you're wrong you're a
[1:49:24] bloody man now
[1:49:25] the episode's taking over it's all your
[1:49:27] fault
[1:49:29] shimmy i look up shimaya means renowned
[1:49:32] his name means renowned
[1:49:34] he's the son of giro which means grain
[1:49:37] or the seed
[1:49:39] do you think he thinks a lot of himself
[1:49:43] of the house of saul he he might have
[1:49:46] been in the royal lineage he might have
[1:49:48] been
[1:49:48] he might have you know had stake on a
[1:49:50] position if saul would have
[1:49:52] if it wouldn't would it would have went
[1:49:54] to jonathan or somebody else one of the
[1:49:55] other heirs in benjamin
[1:49:57] but he lost out and he could not submit
[1:50:00] himself
[1:50:00] all the way to david it only looked like
[1:50:03] he was submitting
[1:50:06] until these spirits lay there god allows
[1:50:09] things to happen to show what spirit's
[1:50:11] laying there
[1:50:12] brother ben said he'll allow you to get
[1:50:14] sick just to see what you'll do about it
[1:50:17] he'll allow cut trump brother said he'll
[1:50:19] allow troubles to come in the church
[1:50:22] just to see what you'll do about it just
[1:50:24] to expose spirits that are laying there
[1:50:28] shimmy i was an evil spirit that was
[1:50:30] laying in the church
[1:50:31] and it went unrecognized until absalom
[1:50:34] tried to take over and david looked like
[1:50:36] he's losing everything and when david's
[1:50:37] completely defeated and marching out
[1:50:39] then shemia shows where he's really
[1:50:41] at and where his allegiance really is
[1:50:45] and david didn't forget about it but he
[1:50:47] gave all judgment to the son
[1:50:49] he said don't forget shimmy i bring his
[1:50:52] hori head to the grave in blood
[1:50:55] but solomon's going to act like christ
[1:50:58] he's not just going to run up he's going
[1:50:59] to extend mercy
[1:51:00] he's going to extend an opportunity how
[1:51:02] does he extend an opportunity he gives
[1:51:04] him a commandment
[1:51:07] see the word the word is the judge
[1:51:12] see shimaya is not going to keep the
[1:51:15] king's word
[1:51:15] and when shemiah doesn't keep the word
[1:51:18] the word was already the judge
[1:51:20] if you would have loved the king you
[1:51:22] would have loved his word when you
[1:51:23] failed his word you showed you didn't
[1:51:24] love him
[1:51:27] so the word is the judge as soon as
[1:51:30] as soon as shimmy i violated this word
[1:51:33] which was given
[1:51:34] as an extension of mercy why did shimmy
[1:51:37] i say
[1:51:38] that's good that's good what you said
[1:51:39] that's a good word because he knows he's
[1:51:41] guilty
[1:51:42] he knows he deserves death you know he
[1:51:45] was he was sweating bullets when david
[1:51:47] came back across
[1:51:48] jordan to be reinstated king and he goes
[1:51:50] down and he bounces before him david and
[1:51:51] he begs him for mercy
[1:51:54] and david granted him mercy even though
[1:51:57] joab's brother said let's kill him he
[1:52:00] said nobody's going to die today today's
[1:52:02] a great day we're coming back
[1:52:05] but david didn't forget he gave judgment
[1:52:08] to the son
[1:52:10] and now shimmy i you know
[1:52:14] now he acts like he's submitted
[1:52:17] but that old spirit still laying there
[1:52:20] it doesn't matter how long amen i've
[1:52:23] seen it already
[1:52:24] in my in my lifetime somebody will do
[1:52:26] something
[1:52:27] they'll get off they'll do wrong then
[1:52:29] they'll come back say they're sorry
[1:52:30] and then another week or two or month or
[1:52:33] so later they do the exact same thing
[1:52:35] showing that spirit was never rooted out
[1:52:37] it still laid there
[1:52:39] and shimmy i said that's a good word
[1:52:40] that's good what you said is good
[1:52:42] i'll do that but look at this
[1:52:47] verse 39 and it came to pass at the end
[1:52:49] of three years that two of the servants
[1:52:50] of shimaya ran away
[1:52:52] into his son of mayaka king of gath
[1:52:55] and they and they told shimaya saying
[1:52:57] behold thy servants be in gath
[1:52:59] and shimmy i rose and saddled his ass
[1:53:01] and went to gath to achis
[1:53:03] to seek his servants and shemia went and
[1:53:05] brought his servants from gath
[1:53:07] and it was told solomon that shemia had
[1:53:09] gone from jerusalem to gath and was come
[1:53:11] again
[1:53:12] and the king sent and called for
[1:53:14] shemitah and said unto him did i not
[1:53:16] make thee to swear by the lord
[1:53:18] and protested thee saying know for a
[1:53:20] certain on the day that thou goest out
[1:53:22] and walk us to broad
[1:53:24] any thither any weather that thou shalt
[1:53:26] surely die
[1:53:27] and thou sayest unto me the word that i
[1:53:29] had heard is good
[1:53:31] why then has thou not kept thy oath of
[1:53:33] the lord and thy commandment that i have
[1:53:35] charged thee with
[1:53:36] the king said moreover to shimmy i thou
[1:53:39] knowest all the wickedness which thine
[1:53:41] heart is privy to that thou didst to
[1:53:42] david my father
[1:53:44] therefore the lord shall return thy
[1:53:45] wickedness upon thine own head
[1:53:48] and king solomon shall be blessed and
[1:53:49] the throne of david shall be established
[1:53:51] before the lord forever
[1:53:52] so the king commanded banaya the son of
[1:53:54] jehoiada
[1:53:56] which went out and fell upon him that he
[1:53:58] died and the kingdom was established in
[1:54:00] the hand of solomon
[1:54:02] this is the last spirit that he gets rid
[1:54:04] of
[1:54:06] a spirit that when it's in trouble and
[1:54:09] cornered and caught
[1:54:11] can submit
[1:54:14] when it's caught when it's exposed when
[1:54:18] when the when when everybody's in
[1:54:20] strength and everything looks good
[1:54:22] it can cement but it never died it never
[1:54:25] went away
[1:54:26] he said solomon's words were good but he
[1:54:28] didn't love solomon and he didn't love
[1:54:30] his commandment he loved himself
[1:54:34] because after three years when his
[1:54:36] servants ran away
[1:54:37] amen that was a loss and he was not
[1:54:40] willing to sacrifice for the word
[1:54:44] that spirit's still alive as long as
[1:54:47] there was no sacrifice he could keep the
[1:54:49] word
[1:54:49] the moment that he had to sacrifice for
[1:54:52] the word
[1:54:53] he was no longer willing to sacrifice
[1:54:55] for the word he probably assumed after
[1:54:57] three years
[1:54:58] solomon forgot he won't mind it'll be
[1:55:00] okay i'll be able to go out and do this
[1:55:02] and slip back and he'll never know
[1:55:06] don't think that spirit doesn't still
[1:55:08] try to work
[1:55:10] right here among us doesn't matter how
[1:55:12] long it's been
[1:55:13] doesn't matter how many years it's been
[1:55:15] the word is the word
[1:55:18] doesn't matter how long ago that
[1:55:20] happened or how many years ago that the
[1:55:22] word is the word
[1:55:25] and he would not sacrifice himself for
[1:55:28] the word
[1:55:29] he was willing to sacrifice the word for
[1:55:32] himself
[1:55:33] and because he was willing to sacrifice
[1:55:34] the word for himself
[1:55:36] he died also
[1:55:39] i wonder how many people
[1:55:43] spiritually die in jerusalem
[1:55:48] i wonder how many people refuse the word
[1:55:51] do like job hold on to the altar
[1:55:53] i'll be safe as long as i stay right
[1:55:55] here with all these believers
[1:55:57] as long as i stay in this house affair
[1:55:59] as long as i stay at this altar of
[1:56:01] incense
[1:56:02] i'll be safe nothing will happen to me
[1:56:04] here
[1:56:05] and that's the very very place you die
[1:56:12] spiritually
[1:56:14] stay under the word
[1:56:18] but but these circumstances
[1:56:22] like that was i agree i should stay here
[1:56:26] but i've got two servants run away i
[1:56:27] mean you understand the circumstances
[1:56:34] there was no there was no clauses in the
[1:56:37] in the statement
[1:56:38] solomon made there was no exemptions
[1:56:42] to the word and he acknowledged that it
[1:56:44] was a good word
[1:56:45] until he had to sacrifice for that word
[1:56:48] then all of a sudden he was willing to
[1:56:49] lay the word aside
[1:56:50] for himself i say friends let's not let
[1:56:54] that spirit creep in
[1:56:56] let's keep it out god said it
[1:57:00] that's the way it's going to be if god
[1:57:03] restricted me here i'm restricted here
[1:57:07] not for three years not for 10 years not
[1:57:09] for 30 years but if i'm restricted by
[1:57:10] the word here
[1:57:11] and i'm told to stay here i will stay
[1:57:14] here
[1:57:15] if it cost me everything i will stay
[1:57:18] here
[1:57:21] see after these spirits were rooted out
[1:57:25] adenisia who threw subtility
[1:57:28] in the wrong approach tried to take what
[1:57:30] wasn't his
[1:57:32] through joab who was willing to kill and
[1:57:34] murder
[1:57:36] to stay on top shimayai
[1:57:40] amen who would hide out in submission
[1:57:42] until the right time
[1:57:44] and show what was really in him 8th are
[1:57:47] the wrong
[1:57:48] person in the wrong position
[1:57:51] of those things were in the church but
[1:57:53] under the king under the rulership of
[1:57:55] solomon solomon
[1:57:57] purged all of that out of the church
[1:58:00] and i want to say it greater than
[1:58:01] solomon's here
[1:58:04] if it could be persian that day jesus
[1:58:06] christ came and plotted together
[1:58:08] accords and he went and beat the money
[1:58:09] changed out of the church because he had
[1:58:11] zeal for the house of the lord
[1:58:14] don't think that he doesn't still have
[1:58:16] zeal for the house of the lord
[1:58:18] only the house of the lord is not this
[1:58:19] building the house of the lord is you
[1:58:22] and he has the same zeal for you as he
[1:58:25] had for that temple there
[1:58:27] and if he's got to take a whip and come
[1:58:29] after us with a whip in our lives to
[1:58:31] drive out the money changers amen so
[1:58:33] that his house will be a house of prayer
[1:58:35] and worship
[1:58:36] he will do it friends he still has
[1:58:39] bonaires in this day he still has
[1:58:42] zadoks he still has those that will
[1:58:43] stand with him in the word and
[1:58:45] accomplish his word
[1:58:47] still zealous over his house and we are
[1:58:49] that house and he's still going to purge
[1:58:51] out
[1:58:51] everything that's hindering us friends a
[1:58:54] greater than solomon
[1:58:56] is here
[1:59:02] i'm going to read another passage of
[1:59:03] scripture with you matthew 23.
[1:59:07] we'll look at jesus talking to some
[1:59:10] priests
[1:59:11] and then we'll finish up with this
[1:59:15] matthew 23
[1:59:24] and i think we'll start matthew 23 and
[1:59:26] verse 13.
[1:59:34] woe unto you scribes pharisees
[1:59:38] hypocrites

[2:00:04] hell than yourselves woe
[2:00:05] unto you you blind guides which say
[2:00:08] whosoever shall swear by the temple it
[2:00:10] is nothing
[2:00:10] but whosoever shall swear by the gold of
[2:00:12] the temple he is in a debtor
[2:00:14] ye fools and blind for whether is
[2:00:16] greater the gold or the temple that
[2:00:18] sanctifieth the ghoul
[2:00:20] whosoever shall swear by the altar it is
[2:00:22] nothing but whosoever sweareth by the
[2:00:23] gift that is upon the
[2:00:24] opponent he is guilty he fools and blind
[2:00:28] for whether is greater the gift or the
[2:00:29] altar that sanctified the gift

[2:00:55] judgment mercy and faith these ought you
[2:00:57] to have done and not to leave the other
[2:00:59] undone
[2:01:00] you blind guides which strain at a gnat
[2:01:02] and swallow a camel
[2:01:04] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[2:01:06] hypocrites if you make clean the outside
[2:01:08] of the cup and of the platter but within
[2:01:10] they are full of
[2:01:11] extortion and excess you blind pharisees
[2:01:14] cleanse first that which is within the
[2:01:15] cup
[2:01:16] and the platter that the outside of them
[2:01:18] may be clean also
[2:01:19] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[2:01:21] hypocrites for your likened to the white
[2:01:23] of sepulcher which indeed appear
[2:01:25] beautiful outward
[2:01:26] but are within full of dead men's bones
[2:01:28] and of
[2:01:29] all uncleanness let's go back to chapter
[2:01:33] six i want to read one more passage and
[2:01:34] then comment on that
[2:01:37] matthew 6 and 1.
[2:01:48] matthew chapter 6 verse 1
[2:01:52] take heed that you do not your alms
[2:01:53] before men to be seen of them
[2:01:55] otherwise you have no reward of your
[2:01:57] faith father which is in heaven
[2:01:59] therefore when thou doest thine alms do
[2:02:01] not sound a trumpet before thee as the
[2:02:03] hypocrites do in the synagogues
[2:02:05] and in the streets that they may have
[2:02:07] glory of men verily i say unto you
[2:02:09] they have their reward but when thou
[2:02:11] doest alms let not thy left hand know
[2:02:13] what thy right hand doeth
[2:02:15] that thine alms may be in secret that
[2:02:16] thy father which seeth in secret himself
[2:02:18] shall reward the openly
[2:02:20] and when thou prayest thou shall not be
[2:02:22] as the hypocrites are for they love to
[2:02:23] pray standing in the synagogues and in
[2:02:25] the corners of the streets
[2:02:26] that they may be seen of men verily i
[2:02:28] say unto you they have their reward
[2:02:31] but thou will now prayest enter into thy
[2:02:33] closet when i will shut thy door pray to
[2:02:35] thy father which is in secret
[2:02:37] and my father which seeth in secret
[2:02:39] shall reward thee openly
[2:02:42] i read this two passages of scripture
[2:02:43] for a reason
[2:02:45] because by that you can begin to see by
[2:02:47] the way jesus talks to the pharisees
[2:02:50] that he realizes that they don't love
[2:02:52] god
[2:02:54] they do not love god and they do not
[2:02:57] love the word
[2:02:59] all that they love is themselves
[2:03:02] he's finding the same thing that day in
[2:03:05] that church
[2:03:06] that solomon found in his day
[2:03:10] joab loved himself more than he loved
[2:03:11] the king abathur loved himself more than
[2:03:13] he loved the king
[2:03:14] shimmy i loved himself more than he
[2:03:16] loved the king
[2:03:18] adonijah loved himself and when he loved
[2:03:20] the king it was all for self
[2:03:22] self self you brought in your
[2:03:24] phylacteries amen when you're fasting
[2:03:26] you whiten your face and so that you
[2:03:28] look gone so that you look so everybody
[2:03:30] knows
[2:03:30] you're religious but you have no love of
[2:03:32] god
[2:03:33] you're outwardly like a wider wall but
[2:03:36] inside you're full of dead men's bones
[2:03:37] you look right you look close to the top
[2:03:39] you're going into the altar amen you're
[2:03:41] burning incense you're giving sacrifice
[2:03:44] you're sounding a trump and you're
[2:03:45] dumping alms by the truckload into the
[2:03:47] basket
[2:03:47] amen but you don't do it for me you
[2:03:50] don't do it for god you do it for you
[2:03:55] joab amen when he killed absalom and
[2:03:58] when he killed a mesa and when he killed
[2:03:59] abner he wasn't doing it for david he
[2:04:01] was doing it for himself
[2:04:04] when abby athar went to pour the
[2:04:06] anointing on adonijah he wasn't doing it
[2:04:08] for david he was doing it for himself
[2:04:12] and jesus come and unraveled the whole
[2:04:15] system
[2:04:16] your whole system is to look good but
[2:04:18] it's not because you love
[2:04:19] god it's because you love yourself
[2:04:23] if you loved god you would keep the word
[2:04:26] you would keep it in spirit and in truth
[2:04:29] you wouldn't make a form or a religion
[2:04:31] out of it whereby you could hold others
[2:04:32] in bondage and you yourself can be
[2:04:34] exalted
[2:04:36] it's not about self when jesus came it
[2:04:39] wasn't about him it was about the father
[2:04:43] they had a they had a system like they
[2:04:46] had
[2:04:48] joab wanted to be the mighty man abe
[2:04:50] author wanted to be the high priest
[2:04:51] shemiah wanted saul's kingdom to
[2:04:54] continue so he could be something and
[2:04:55] adam naija wanted to be the next king
[2:04:58] but banaya wanted to please david
[2:05:02] but zadok wanted to serve god you see
[2:05:06] the difference
[2:05:08] these things got to be rooted out of
[2:05:10] jerusalem
[2:05:11] why because there's another gift there's
[2:05:14] another gift to rally around friends
[2:05:17] it wasn't it wasn't the gift it wasn't
[2:05:20] another solomon
[2:05:21] that can stand here and give you wisdom
[2:05:23] about birds and trees it wasn't just
[2:05:25] like another jesus christ it was the
[2:05:26] same thing that was in solomon is the
[2:05:28] same thing that was in jesus christ
[2:05:29] the same thing that was in our brother
[2:05:31] branham and it's the same thing that's
[2:05:33] here now
[2:05:34] it's the word the full life of the word
[2:05:36] is here
[2:05:38] and looking for those who will keep the
[2:05:41] least
[2:05:42] of his commandment looking for those who
[2:05:45] will sacrifice who will die
[2:05:46] who will wait till he speaks before they
[2:05:48] move who will not exalt themselves but
[2:05:50] will
[2:05:50] base themselves those that will stay low
[2:05:52] and stay humble and stay with the word
[2:05:54] and wait for him to speak that's what
[2:05:57] he's looking for
[2:05:59] and i want to be one of them and i say
[2:06:02] lord
[2:06:03] in 2020 give me 20 20 vision
[2:06:07] of myself not everybody else around me
[2:06:11] i mean denominational people can discern
[2:06:13] that the world's in trouble and in
[2:06:14] judgment
[2:06:16] it doesn't take a lot of discernment to
[2:06:18] know what's going on out there
[2:06:21] i mean people who don't even go to
[2:06:22] church knows that the world's in
[2:06:23] judgment
[2:06:26] it doesn't take much discernment to find
[2:06:28] faults in your brothers and your sisters
[2:06:30] and your problems but jesus says make
[2:06:32] sure you get that beam out of your own
[2:06:34] eye first
[2:06:35] before you pluck the boat
[2:06:38] how are you going to get the beam out of
[2:06:40] your own eye without a mirror
[2:06:44] there's a greater than solomon here and
[2:06:47] the greater than solomon is here
[2:06:50] to purge all the spirits away from the
[2:06:52] church
[2:06:53] to bring us to a golden age this is our
[2:06:57] golden age
[2:06:58] friends if we can accept the gift that's
[2:07:00] among us which is the restored word if
[2:07:02] we can accept the gift that's among us
[2:07:04] we can have a golden age it could be in
[2:07:06] a golden age in your heart it can be a
[2:07:08] golden age in your family it can be a
[2:07:09] golden age with your brothers and
[2:07:11] sisters if we'll just let the word rule
[2:07:13] and discern
[2:07:14] and purge out all the spirits i say god
[2:07:18] if you have to cup me cut me if you have
[2:07:21] to cut me to save me cut me
[2:07:24] but don't let me go the wrong way
[2:07:28] let's all stand musicians you can come
[2:07:35] i want to read romans 6 and 3 where
[2:07:39] we're standing
[2:07:41] know you not that so many of us that
[2:07:43] were baptized into jesus christ were
[2:07:45] baptized into his death
[2:07:46] therefore we are buried with him by
[2:07:48] baptism in the death that like as christ
[2:07:50] was raised up from the dead by the glory
[2:07:52] of the father even so we also should
[2:07:54] walk in newness of life
[2:07:56] for if we've been planted together in
[2:07:58] the likeness of his death
[2:07:59] we shall be also in the likeness of his
[2:08:01] resurrection
[2:08:03] knowing this that our old man is
[2:08:04] crucified with him that the body of sin
[2:08:06] might be destroyed that henceforth we
[2:08:08] should not serve sin
[2:08:10] for he that is dead is free from sin now
[2:08:13] if we be dead with christ we believe
[2:08:15] that we shall also live with him
[2:08:17] knowing that christ being raised from
[2:08:18] the dead dieth no more death
[2:08:20] hath no more dominion over him for and
[2:08:23] that he died he died in the sin once but
[2:08:25] in that he liveth
[2:08:26] he liveth unto god likewise reckon
[2:08:29] you're also yourselves to be dead
[2:08:31] indeed unto sin but alive in god through
[2:08:34] jesus christ our lord
[2:08:36] let not sin therefore reign in your
[2:08:37] mortal body that you should obey it in
[2:08:39] the lust thereof neither you
[2:08:41] yield yield ye your members as
[2:08:43] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin
[2:08:45] but yield yourselves unto god
[2:08:47] as those that are alive from the dead
[2:08:50] and your members as instruments of
[2:08:51] righteousness
[2:08:53] unto god you know who i want to be
[2:08:57] banaya
[2:09:00] don't have to be on top i don't have to
[2:09:02] be the best i don't have to have the
[2:09:04] most stories or songs song about me
[2:09:06] i just want to wait for the lord's
[2:09:08] command and i want to fulfill the lord's
[2:09:09] command
[2:09:10] no matter how hard no matter how much it
[2:09:12] costs me
[2:09:14] i don't want to chase false movements
[2:09:16] and i won't chase false empires
[2:09:18] and i don't want to have to tear down
[2:09:20] others to keep myself up
[2:09:22] i just want to be banaya i just want to
[2:09:25] stay there
[2:09:25] i saw i saw the ministry of david he
[2:09:28] served david and now
[2:09:29] he saw david he saw him move from the
[2:09:31] ministry of david to the ministry of
[2:09:33] solomon
[2:09:34] and now he moved because he wanted to be
[2:09:36] where god was
[2:09:38] and when he's here with solomon there's
[2:09:40] a greater than solomon here and i want
[2:09:41] to be benign i want to stay here serve
[2:09:43] him
[2:09:44] not serve me serve him
[2:09:47] banaya got his position not because he
[2:09:49] fought for it clamored for it spoke for
[2:09:51] put it in a good word made alliances
[2:09:53] with other people he got his position
[2:09:55] because he gave his whole life to the
[2:09:57] king
[2:09:59] and i want to give my whole life to the
[2:10:01] king
[2:10:02] and wherever he grants me to be i want
[2:10:04] to serve him there
[2:10:05] amen whether it be up or whether it be
[2:10:07] down amen whether go good or whether or
[2:10:09] go bad
[2:10:10] i want to give my whole life to the king
[2:10:12] and serve the king
[2:10:15] if you'll be a beast thou shalt be
[2:10:18] exalted in due
[2:10:19] time i don't care
[2:10:22] i don't care if it comes at the judgment
[2:10:24] of rewards it never comes in this life
[2:10:26] i'm fine with that i don't care if he
[2:10:29] defers
[2:10:30] everything for me until future i'm fine
[2:10:32] with that but right now i want to stay
[2:10:34] with the king
[2:10:37] a greater than solomon is here and it's
[2:10:40] not in one person

[2:16:33] so we're going to dedicate little
[2:16:34] nazarene kusukika
[2:16:37] you know when miradi their first baby
[2:16:41] was born
[2:16:42] she was an absolute miracle the doctor
[2:16:45] said she couldn't have a child she
[2:16:46] couldn't conceive
[2:16:47] but but god had showed them and he had
[2:16:49] showed brother peter in a dream that
[2:16:51] they'd have a baby
[2:16:52] and brother peter and sister sarah both
[2:16:54] knew the baby would come
[2:16:56] and god against all odds he brought
[2:16:59] little miradie
[2:17:00] and after she was born sister sarah had
[2:17:03] so many complications and so much
[2:17:04] trouble the doctor said

[2:17:07] you can't have another child she can't
[2:17:09] take it
[2:17:10] and but sister sarah said god will take
[2:17:12] care of it

[2:17:23] that's fine let them say what they need
[2:17:25] to say all that they can see
[2:17:27] but we don't look at what we see we look

[2:18:25] strengthen their arms and give them
[2:18:27] wisdom and your leadership

[2:18:32] like to be raised in a home that's set
[2:18:34] aside and sanctified and holy
[2:18:36] with the presence of the holy ghost and
[2:18:38] your holy angels there
[2:18:40] god that she might grow in your presence
