[0:00] We just think we're a lump of coal
[0:04] and no value to us. And you know
[0:08] the only difference between those they
[0:11] got the same makeup.
[0:13] [Music]
[0:16] One just was elected.
[0:20] One was predetermined
[0:24] that when the pressures and strains of
[0:26] life, all of that coal, that coal,
[0:29] right, that piece of coal that's right
[0:31] beside that diamond was under the same
[0:33] pressure.
[0:36] Wasn't like it was a piece of coal 5
[0:38] miles away and one over here.
[0:41] But however that happened, there was a
[0:44] predestinated predetermined moment where
[0:46] that diamond, that lump of coal would
[0:48] have transforming power
[0:50] and it would spark
[0:53] and the fire would ignite in that lump
[0:56] of coal and it'd be transformed into a
[0:59] diamond.
[1:01] And you know that diamond can dance and
[1:04] shout and run the aisles and say, "I'm a
[1:06] diamond. I'm no longer a lump of coal.
[1:11] But you know what?
[1:13] There's still more work to be done
[1:17] &gt;&gt; cuz there's fire inside that diamond
[1:19] that needs to be unlocked.
[1:21] But you know what happens? It's going to
[1:24] take a wise master builder,
[1:29] &gt;&gt; the chief jeweler
[1:31] &gt;&gt; to look at that diamond and flip it this
[1:33] way and flip it that way and go, you
[1:35] know what?
[1:37] I see this particular. It needs to be
[1:40] cut here and honed here and because it
[1:43] can look inside and see the fire inside
[1:45] that needs unlocked,
[1:48] &gt;&gt; but it's got to be honed and chiseled
[1:50] and sliced and diced. And it may be this
[1:54] big,
[1:56] but there's a whole lot of imperfections
[1:58] that that jeweler looks at and sees and
[2:00] goes, "Nope, that's got to go."
[2:03] And that great big diamond can end up
[2:06] being a little itty bitty teensy thing.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; But the reason why is because it was
[2:14] just that little itty bitty teensy piece
[2:16] that was perfection of perfection.
[2:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19] &gt;&gt; And so all of the they call them
[2:21] inclusions. All of you sisters know what
[2:23] I mean like. Amen.
[2:26] Right.
[2:28] All them inclusions had to because you
[2:29] want that perfect diamond.
[2:32] You want that fire to sparkle when he
[2:34] puts it on the hand.
[2:35] [Music]
[2:38] See, everything's got to be cut off. And
[2:41] I hope I hope you let the Lord cut some
[2:43] things off for you this morning
[2:47] because God's got a purpose in it. He
[2:50] He's He's not here to destroy us. He's
[2:53] here to love us. He's here to nurture us
[2:56] and make us his own. If we'll get on the
[2:58] potter's wheel, if we'll listen to his
[3:01] voice and hear his touch, can we do it
[3:04] this morning?
[3:06] Brother Brandham says, he says, "Listen,
[3:08] brother, you're never saved by any sign.
[3:12] You're never saved by any sensation.
[3:15] You are saved when you met God's
[3:17] condition of his word, and nothing else
[3:20] are you saved by." You say, "Brother
[3:21] Gabe, I the way you're saying is cutting
[3:23] me, and I don't feel saved.
[3:28] It's not by feelings.
[3:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:32] &gt;&gt; Listen, you said, "Brother Gab, you
[3:33] preaching on touch and feel." That's
[3:35] exactly right. But I'm not talking about
[3:37] this.
[3:40] I'm talking about those tenderhearted,
[3:42] inward yearning boughs of mercy
[3:47] because your feelings is going to you'll
[3:49] have you'll be on a mountaintop one day
[3:51] and a valley the next. And brother
[3:53] Brandham tells us, he says, "You're
[3:54] saved because you met God's conditions."
[3:58] He says, "That's right. God's word is
[4:00] made a way. You're not saved because you
[4:02] feel like you're saved. I'm not saved
[4:05] because I feel like I'm saved." Cuz a
[4:07] lot of times I don't feel that way.
[4:12] &gt;&gt; Malachi 4.
[4:18] Yeah.
[4:20] And you young ones need to understand
[4:22] that cuz there's going to be valleys.
[4:24] There's going to be pitfalls. There's
[4:26] going to be backslidings. There's going
[4:28] to be downsittings. There's going to be
[4:29] uprisings.
[4:31] But through it all,
[4:34] you have to rest in the fact that you
[4:35] met God's requirements.
[4:38] You felt the prick of your heart. You
[4:40] heeded to it. You was baptized in the
[4:43] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[4:44] remission of sin. And you received the
[4:47] gift of the Holy Ghost cuz the promise
[4:49] was unto you.
