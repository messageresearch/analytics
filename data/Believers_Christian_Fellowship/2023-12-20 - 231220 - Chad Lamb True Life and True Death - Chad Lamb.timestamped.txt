[12:27] together in our Bibles and as we do I

[12:50] so if you've got a special amen please
[12:52] get with brother Mike and let him know
[12:54] so he can get that to the song leader
[12:57] amen uh also I walked by the welcome
[13:00] desk and saw that there's still some
[13:02] candy left over from India so hey you
[13:04] got another chance if you missed out on
[13:07] Sunday you got another chance to grab
[13:08] some before it's gone amen let's read
[13:11] from John chapter 1 this evening John
[13:14] chapter 1 verse
[13:16] one in the beginning was the word and
[13:19] the Word was with God and the Word was
[13:21] God the same was in the beginning with
[13:24] God all things were made by him and
[13:26] without him was not anything made that
[13:28] was made in him was life and the life
[13:32] was the light of men and the light
[13:34] shineth in darkness and the Darkness
[13:36] comprehended it not amen God bless you
[13:39] as you have your seats
[13:42] amen there's some scriptures we just
[13:44] read again and again and I don't think
[13:47] we could ever exhaust them there's
[13:48] depths here that we have not yet
[13:50] explored there there's the the word of
[13:53] God is eternal and and every verse can
[13:55] be a portal into the Eternal thoughts of
[13:58] God
[13:59] amen and as we look here I want to focus
[14:01] on um verse four in him was life and the
[14:06] life was the light of men and who was
[14:08] life this we know this is speaking of
[14:10] Christ but it's saying the word in the
[14:12] beginning amen was the word and the Word
[14:15] was with God and the Word was God the
[14:17] same was in the beginning with God all
[14:20] things were made by him and without him
[14:21] was not anything made that was made so
[14:23] we know we're speaking of Christ Christ
[14:25] the word amen is the Son of God Amen and
[14:30] in him was life in who in the word was
[14:33] life and the life was the light of men
[14:37] amen so I want to speak this evening I
[14:39] just want to do some teaching on a
[14:41] subject of true life and true death amen
[14:44] true life and true death amen we talk
[14:47] about life and death all the time but
[14:49] what we speak of of life and death is
[14:50] not true life and true death there only
[14:53] semblances or Shadows or types of life
[14:55] and death so we we we refer to life we
[14:58] refer to death but actually I want to
[15:01] look at what is true life and what is
[15:03] true death amen uh when we look at the
[15:07] the message brother B says and sir we
[15:09] would see Jesus said God is life life
[15:13] eternal in the beginning was God he
[15:15] wasn't God at that time because God the
[15:17] English word god means object of worship
[15:19] and there wasn't nothing but him he was
[15:21] the Eternal just the Eternal one so when
[15:25] God was alone we know God dwelt Alone
[15:27] with his thoughts and before there was
[15:29] anything there was God Amen and he
[15:31] didn't even have the title of God cuz
[15:33] there's nothing to worship him he was
[15:35] Elohim he was the great self-existing
[15:37] one I mean nothing kept him he he was
[15:40] everything amen before there was
[15:42] anything it was God or what we call God
[15:46] Elohim and that is life amen that that
[15:50] is the origination of everything
[15:53] everything comes out of Elohim there's
[15:55] nothing before him but everything is
[15:57] after him he doesn't come from anything
[16:00] but everything comes from him so when
[16:02] you go all the way back to the origin
[16:04] you go back to Elohim we go back to God
[16:07] and that is eternal life that is life
[16:10] that's why brother Benham said God is
[16:12] life amen so we want to know what life
[16:14] is we just go all the way back to the
[16:16] origin and you go back to the origin
[16:18] it's God God is life amen and we want to
[16:21] know what true life is that's it
[16:25] amen and so uh brother Ram says and who
[16:28] is this melkisedek he said notice now
[16:32] his attribute then the attribute was
[16:34] first God the thought the attribute
[16:36] itself all in one without being
[16:39] expressed then when he expressed
[16:41] secondarily he became then the word and
[16:44] then the word was made flesh and dwelt
[16:46] Among Us St John the first chapter in
[16:49] the first verse notice it said in the
[16:50] beginning but before the Eternal notice
[16:54] in the beginning was the word when the
[16:56] time began it was word but before it was
[17:00] word it was attribute a thought then it
[17:02] was expressed in the beginning was the
[17:05] expression the word amen just to just to
[17:09] review this and just to talk about it
[17:11] before we move on Amen when God was
[17:13] alone he brother B said he was alone
[17:15] with his thoughts amen uh God consisted
[17:18] of his thoughts and he was alone with
[17:20] the thoughts about himself about how he
[17:22] would Express himself amen and how that
[17:25] expression would become material so that
[17:28] that thought was God the Eternal amen
[17:32] when God began to express himself amen
[17:35] the first thing that came forth from him
[17:37] brother B said was the logos amen and
[17:40] the form of a a great light that light
[17:42] began to move out and it came from the
[17:44] Father the logos and which that word
[17:46] logos is just the Greek word of word
[17:48] when we said in the beginning was the
[17:50] word the Greek word is logos so out from
[17:53] the expression the first expression from
[17:55] God is word because a thought expressed
[17:59] his
[18:00] word amen so when God began to express
[18:03] himself the first thing that came forth
[18:06] was the word his thought expressed
[18:10] amen and that word he called son because
[18:14] it came from the father so out from the
[18:17] originator the father comes the word and
[18:20] when it comes forth or its birth or or
[18:23] it comes from the father he calls it son
[18:26] and in him is life amen why is life in
[18:30] him because this word logos means the
[18:33] word with the concept or the thought
[18:36] amen it's not just a word that you just
[18:38] pick up and read amen but this word is
[18:41] attached back to the thought it contains
[18:44] within it the concept or thought of that
[18:46] word so if the thought is in the word
[18:49] then life is in the word because the
[18:51] thought was God and is
[18:53] eternal so when the thoughts expressed
[18:56] and now the thought comes with the the
[18:58] word amen then there's life in that
[19:03] word I hope I hope that's understandable
[19:06] amen I'm not trying to get it too deep
[19:08] or too complicated just so that we
[19:11] understand amen these things that the
[19:13] prophet of God taught us that is life
[19:16] because life is God and God was before
[19:19] anything when he was alone with his
[19:21] thoughts God consisted of his
[19:23] thoughts now when God wants to express
[19:26] that thought has to move from the
[19:28] invisible from the unknown from the
[19:30] darkness of mystery and when it first
[19:33] begins to form brother why does brother
[19:36] say it forms as a light amen because all
[19:38] through the Bible light means
[19:40] illumination means understanding amen
[19:43] understanding of what understanding
[19:44] what's back here in the darkness in the
[19:46] mind of God that nobody understood so as
[19:49] God begins to express himself amen it's
[19:52] typed with light amen because light has
[19:54] to do with
[19:56] understanding when you're enlightened
[19:58] you understand something so we've used
[20:01] this analogy before if we go into a dark
[20:03] room pitch black dark no light
[20:05] whatsoever not even a sliver of light so
[20:08] dark you can't see anything amen you
[20:11] have absolutely no understanding or no
[20:13] knowledge of the room you're standing in
[20:15] you don't know where the pieces of
[20:16] furniture are you don't know where the
[20:18] doors or the windows are you don't know
[20:19] anything you're just standing in a
[20:21] darkened room you don't know if there's
[20:23] other people in the room you don't know
[20:24] anything about the you don't know the
[20:26] dimensions you don't know the height you
[20:27] know nothing you're an absolute
[20:29] ignorance and total darkness yeah but
[20:33] the minute somebody flips on the switch
[20:35] the very fraction of a second in less
[20:37] than a second you know all
[20:39] things I mean the the second the light
[20:42] hit your eyes you know how many people
[20:44] in the room you know how high it is you
[20:45] know how wide it is you know the color
[20:47] of paint you know the furniture that's
[20:48] there you know where the door is you
[20:50] know so much information the moment you
[20:52] receive that Revelation all of a sudden
[20:54] so much comes to your understanding
[20:56] that's the difference between light and
[20:58] dark amen this is a theme that runs
[21:00] through the Bible amen and and when we
[21:02] think of light and dark the natural
[21:04] light and dark that we understand is
[21:06] only a type so that we can begin to
[21:09] understand what light and dark actually
[21:11] is amen light and dark actually is
[21:15] understanding of God and no
[21:16] understanding of
[21:18] God that's the reality what we have now
[21:21] is a reflection of that down into this
[21:24] Dimension so that we have terms that we
[21:26] can use to understand these things it's
[21:29] a way God teaches us through the natural
[21:31] world but this natural world we know is
[21:34] just a vapor this is the negative this
[21:36] isn't the reality this is the
[21:39] Mist
[21:41] amen so now as that great darkness of no
[21:47] understanding of God God dwelling alone
[21:50] when he begins to express so that he can
[21:52] be known what we see is we see a
[21:55] light because light is illumination
[21:58] light is understanding God begins to
[22:01] move as a light and this is the sun this
[22:03] is the word and because it contains the
[22:07] thought of God it has life in
[22:13] it let's turn to John chapter 6 I want
[22:17] to read through quite a few scriptures
[22:19] as we move
[22:21] forward John
[22:26] 6:63 it is the spirit that quickeneth
[22:30] the flesh profiteth nothing the words
[22:32] that I speak unto you they are spirit
[22:35] and they are life amen the words that
[22:38] Jesus was speaking why because those
[22:40] words contain the thought of God he says
[22:44] I speak nothing but what the father
[22:45] tells me amen he got the Revelation from
[22:48] the Father the thought of God and he
[22:50] went to speak that and when he spoke
[22:52] that word that was spirit and that was
[22:54] life it had the life of God in the
[22:56] spoken word because it was the thought
[22:58] of God being
[23:01] expressed let's let's flip over to First
[23:05] John all the way over near Revelation
[23:07] over to First John chapter
[23:16] 5 1 John chapter
[23:19] 5 and verse
[23:25] 11 and this is the record that God has
[23:28] given to us eternal life and this life
[23:31] is in his
[23:33] son why is that because his son is the
[23:36] word amen Jesus Christ is the word the
[23:39] word made manifest is Christ the
[23:41] anointed word and in him is life
[23:45] amen he that hath the son hath life and
[23:48] he that hath not the Son of God hath not
[23:52] life am remember we want to talk about
[23:55] what is true life and what is true death
[24:00] let's while we're back here let's go to
[24:05] James James chap 4:14 James 4 And1
[24:15] 14 James 4:14 says whereas you know not
[24:18] what shall be on the tomorrow for what
[24:20] is your life it is even a vapor that
[24:22] appear for a little time and then
[24:25] vanisheth
[24:26] away James is speaking of your natural
[24:28] life what is your life it's just a
[24:31] fleeting moment it's just a vapor that
[24:33] that vanishes away that's what this
[24:36] natural life is that's not true
[24:39] life that's our Natural Life brother
[24:42] Brenham says this is the negative the
[24:45] negative part of life is where you're
[24:47] living now and anything if there's a
[24:49] negative there's got to be a positive
[24:51] before there can be a negative therefore
[24:53] if this is a negative there's got to be
[24:55] a positive somewhere and this ain't the
[24:58] real thing this is only a foreshadow of
[25:00] the real thing that is to come oh praise
[25:03] be to God that what is your life it's
[25:06] the vapor of a Mist but there's more to
[25:08] life than this amen this can't be all
[25:10] there is to life amen you live 80 90
[25:13] years you pass away you go into the
[25:15] grave this is what job was struggling
[25:17] with what is the life of a man what is a
[25:19] man what is this cycle of life this is
[25:21] just the vapor this is just the shadow
[25:23] this isn't real
[25:25] life amen breathing oxygen in and out of
[25:28] your lungs that's not life that's a type
[25:31] of life so you can understand what life
[25:32] is but that's not actual life life is
[25:35] God Amen God is
[25:37] life Amen brother fro if we could pull
[25:40] up the Whiteboard I'm going to uh jot a
[25:42] few things down here as we as we move
[25:44] forward but let's turn to John chap 11
[25:46] as we do
[25:49] that John chap
[25:56] 11
[26:01] John
[26:11] 11:1 these things said he after that
[26:13] they saith in him our friend Lazarus
[26:15] sleepeth but I go that I may awake him
[26:18] out of
[26:20] sleep then said his disciples Lord if he
[26:23] sleep he doeth he shall do well how be
[26:26] Jesus spake of his death but they
[26:27] thought that he had spoken of taking of
[26:29] rest and sleep then said Jesus unto them
[26:32] plainly Lazarus is
[26:35] dead amen when brother bam comes to this
[26:38] section of scripture brother bam says uh
[26:41] Jesus spoke right he said Lazarus
[26:44] sleepeth but they misunderstood what he
[26:46] meant and they thought oh well if
[26:47] Lazarus is sleeping he's recovering he's
[26:50] doing well he's no longer suffering
[26:51] everything's fine and then and he can't
[26:53] get them to understand because they're
[26:55] trapped in this carnal world Amen dark
[26:57] to the things of God to the actual
[26:59] realities they think that this Dimension
[27:02] is the reality amen and they're not
[27:04] understanding brother bram's language so
[27:06] brother Jesus's language so brother bam
[27:08] said Jesus had to put it in languages
[27:10] and terms they would understand and he
[27:13] said Lazarus is
[27:15] dead amen but Jesus already said Lazarus
[27:18] sleep cuz Lazarus not dead Lazarus is a
[27:21] Son of God he's an eternal Gene of God
[27:23] Lazarus cannot
[27:26] die amen
[27:28] so so when we start writing this down
[27:30] here we want to
[27:32] write
[27:34] God
[27:36] is
[27:39] life so we want to start talking about
[27:41] true life we got to go all the way back
[27:43] here amen amen and wherever God is is
[27:46] life so when the word came forth amen
[27:49] when the thought of God was in that word
[27:51] then life was in
[27:55] him when Jesus spoke the thoughts of God
[27:58] became the spoken word of God life was
[28:01] there Jesus said the word I speak unto
[28:03] you there spirit and there are life amen
[28:07] so God is life so now we come to death
[28:10] what is death amen and and Jesus he
[28:13] begins to speak about Lazarus Lazarus is
[28:15] sick and and and his sister sin for
[28:18] Jesus the one you love is is sick and
[28:21] he's going to come and they want him to
[28:22] come and and and heal his body and now
[28:26] Jesus delays and he waits because God's
[28:28] got another purpose in all of this amen
[28:30] and he waits till Lazarus quits
[28:32] breathing oxygen in and out and his body
[28:35] is no longer animate and they take the
[28:37] body and they lay it in a grave but
[28:38] Jesus doesn't consider that death right
[28:42] amen Jesus has a different perspective
[28:46] than an Earthly perspective he's got a
[28:48] Heavenly perspective and my goodness the
[28:50] message is coming our day to change our
[28:52] perspective from the Earthly perspective
[28:54] to the Heavenly perspective so that we
[28:56] begin to to treat these things
[28:58] differently and have a different
[29:00] understanding because we've been brought
[29:01] up On Eagle's Wings and lifted above the
[29:03] Earth so that give an eyesight that we
[29:05] can see that we're not trapped in this
[29:07] Vapor trapped in this mist and stuck in
[29:10] the in the boundaries of this physical
[29:13] but we can escape the boundaries of this
[29:15] physical and move into the Supernatural
[29:18] and say hey they're not dead they're
[29:20] asleep slint Saints don't die they can't
[29:25] die amen so what we call death isn't
[29:29] true death that's right what we call
[29:32] death is a semblance of death or a type
[29:35] of death or a shadow of death but it's
[29:38] not really death amen
[29:41] amen so Jesus had to start speaking
[29:44] their language hey I don't want to live
[29:47] in the day where Jesus has to come down
[29:49] to my Earthly language but I want to
[29:50] start speaking his
[29:52] language right amen let's look at Luke 8
[29:57] together
[30:03] Luke 8 verse
[30:12] 49 Luke 8:49 he says well he yet spake
[30:17] there cometh one from the ruler of the
[30:19] synagogue's house saying to him thy
[30:20] daughter is dead trouble not the master
[30:23] but when Jesus heard it he answered him
[30:25] saying fear not believe only and she
[30:27] shall be made whole and when he came
[30:30] into the house he suffered no man to go
[30:32] in save Peter and James and John and the
[30:34] father and the mother of the maiden and
[30:36] all wept and bewailed her but he said
[30:38] weep not she is not dead but
[30:41] sleepeth the servant already come and
[30:43] says she's dead trouble not the master
[30:46] Jesus says no she's she sleepeth she's
[30:50] not
[30:50] dead and they laughed him to
[30:53] scorn knowing that she was dead W they
[30:58] thought they knew more than the Son of
[31:00] God they laugh here comes the word made
[31:04] flesh amen God in flesh the word amen
[31:07] the fullness of the word made flesh
[31:09] embodied in flesh is standing on the
[31:11] earth and the word says she's not dead
[31:14] but sleepeth and they laughed the word
[31:17] to scorn knowing that she was dead what
[31:20] did they know they knew nothing amen
[31:23] they were their minds were darkened they
[31:25] were alienated from the things of God
[31:27] their mind were totally blackened to the
[31:29] realities and their mind was only open
[31:31] to this Dimension which was Darkness
[31:34] compared to the
[31:35] reality and they laughed him the scar
[31:38] knowing she was dead they didn't know
[31:43] nothing oh I don't want to have this
[31:45] kind of
[31:47] knowledge I want to have a Heavenly
[31:49] knowledge praise be to
[31:53] God and they laughed him to scorn
[31:55] knowing that she was dead and he put put
[31:57] them all out and took her by the hand
[31:59] and called her saying made arise and her
[32:02] spirit came again and she arose straight
[32:05] way and he commanded to give her meat
[32:09] and her parents were astonished but he
[32:11] charged them that they should tell no
[32:12] man what was done oh praise be to God he
[32:16] knew that she wasn't dead amen although
[32:19] that body was laying there lifeless
[32:20] there was no more breath no more what
[32:23] humans call life was there he me she was
[32:26] not dead he knew knew where her spirit
[32:27] was he knew he could call that Spirit
[32:29] back to that body and when that Spirit
[32:31] come back to that body that she would
[32:32] raise again he knew where she was he
[32:35] knew how to find her and he knew how to
[32:36] call her back amen so we know that death
[32:40] is not what we think death is
[32:44] amen amen let's go let's let's now look
[32:48] at Mark chap
[32:50] 12 I just want to grab these places in
[32:52] scripture and lay a scriptural principle
[32:54] down and keep moving from there
[32:57] we find it's it's so amazing that that
[33:01] in the message brother brandham says
[33:03] some things that are so odd and so
[33:05] contrary to our natural intellect so odd
[33:08] and contrary to our human reasoning but
[33:11] that's exactly how Jesus spoke he said
[33:14] things that were so unusual so different
[33:16] than the regular dialogue of that day he
[33:19] he people who they knew we dead he said
[33:22] we're not dead they're sleeping right
[33:24] amen and we find that the prophet is so
[33:27] scriptural in his approach and in his
[33:29] style amen because we know that it was
[33:31] God working through that prophet and so
[33:34] Mark
[33:35] 12 verse
[33:38] 26 he
[33:40] says there Jesus was asked a question by
[33:44] the Sadducees about a a man you know
[33:47] they didn't believe in the
[33:48] resurrection so they asked him a hard
[33:51] question I love this they come to Jesus
[33:54] to ask him a stumper I mean we're going
[33:57] to floor him with this one and here
[33:59] again they're so darkened amen their
[34:02] understanding so darkened here is the
[34:04] word the word made flesh is standing
[34:06] there the word is there and they're
[34:08] challenging the word with their own
[34:10] stomping questions amen I got a tough
[34:13] one for him how can you have a tough
[34:15] question for the
[34:17] word I said okay speaking of the
[34:20] Resurrection now there was a man he had
[34:22] a wife and before that she had a child
[34:26] he died but the law says that her her
[34:28] brother shouldn't go in unto her to
[34:30] raise up seed for the dead now she has
[34:32] the brother now before there's a seed
[34:35] raised up that brother dies and another
[34:37] one another one until all seven brothers
[34:39] had her to wife no seed was raised up
[34:42] all seven die and I said in the
[34:45] resurrection answer this one yeah Mr
[34:50] Jesus see the foolishness of man's
[34:54] thinking you know so many times we've
[34:57] got tough questions for the
[35:04] message tough questions like if that's
[35:06] right then what about this and what
[35:08] about that listen we don't know nothing
[35:10] there's no tough question for the
[35:12] message amen this message came from God
[35:14] it is the word of God it is the true
[35:16] revelation of the true word of God and
[35:18] you think your tough questions is going
[35:20] to stump
[35:22] God the problem is between the ears amen
[35:25] not with the message and not with the
[35:28] Bible their problem was not with the
[35:31] resurrection their problem was the the
[35:34] gray matter between their ears and the
[35:36] Sadducees couldn't figure it out and
[35:38] because they couldn't figure it out
[35:39] they're looking completely with a
[35:41] natural Earthly perspective and that's
[35:43] so many times why we get stumped in the
[35:45] message is because we're thinking low
[35:48] thinking Earthly thinking time matter
[35:51] space sequence of events all the things
[35:53] we understand and the natural and we're
[35:55] not thinking from ahead Heavenly
[35:58] perspective but this message came to
[36:00] lift us out of Leo deia Lift Us above
[36:02] the carnality and bring us back into the
[36:05] mind of
[36:06] God so that the mind of Christ would be
[36:09] in you amen not the carnal Mind of a man
[36:12] but the mind of Christ will be in you
[36:14] with the true interpretation and
[36:15] revelation of the word where we don't
[36:17] have to ask these stumping questions of
[36:19] the message so here the Sadducees had
[36:22] one that was going to stump the
[36:25] word so now in the
[36:30] resurrection amen if you believe in in
[36:33] the resurrection how is she going to
[36:35] have seven husbands in the
[36:38] resurrection and look at what Jesus
[36:41] does he knows the real problem listen
[36:44] the real problem is not the husbands the
[36:47] real problem is they don't believe in
[36:49] the
[36:50] resurrection
[36:51] amen so they're trying to disprove the
[36:54] resurrection with a difficult question
[36:56] about all of these circumstances that
[36:58] don't matter at all
[37:02] amen he says in verse 24 and then Jesus
[37:05] answered and said them do you not
[37:08] therefore he because you know not the
[37:10] scriptures neither the power of God Amen
[37:14] for when they shall rise from the dead
[37:16] they neither marry nor are given in
[37:18] marriage but are as the Angels which are
[37:20] in heaven when Jesus he says when they
[37:22] resurrect they're not going to resurrect
[37:24] with carnal bodies to bring forth a
[37:26] carnal seed like they did in this it's
[37:28] all together different you don't even
[37:30] understand the scriptures or the power
[37:31] of God Amen you're asking a question
[37:34] from down here but there's a whole
[37:35] another understanding up here
[37:40] amen so now he he dealt with that
[37:43] question easily they've got a different
[37:45] kind of body all together and they have
[37:46] a different kind of Desire all together
[37:48] and it's not like what you
[37:50] think then he goes to verse
[37:52] 26 and as touching the Dead that they
[37:57] rise have you not read in the book of
[37:59] Moses how in the bush God spake unto him
[38:02] saying I am the god of Abraham and the
[38:05] god of Isaac and the god of Jacob he is
[38:09] not the god of the dead but the god of
[38:11] the living ye therefore do greatly
[38:16] he what's he saying he's saying didn't
[38:19] you even read your Bible yeah right
[38:23] don't you even know the scriptures amen
[38:26] he says did Moses didn't he say to Moses
[38:29] in the burning bush I am present tense I
[38:33] am present tense the god of Abraham the
[38:36] god of Isaac the god of Jacob amen if
[38:39] Jesus says I am he's speaking present
[38:42] tense that means he said he didn't say I
[38:45] was the god of Abraham because if
[38:47] Abraham was dead he would have said I
[38:49] was the god of Abraham Jacob's dead I
[38:51] was the god of Jacob but Abraham was
[38:54] very much alive when he was speaking to
[38:56] Moses and he said I am present tense
[38:59] right now the god of Abraham who is
[39:01] alive somewhere
[39:02] else he may not be breathing oxygen in
[39:05] and out he may not have amen this body
[39:08] animate and moving it may be turning to
[39:11] dust somewhere in a cave and and and a
[39:13] cave in in Hein but it doesn't change
[39:16] anything about whether or not Abraham's
[39:18] alive or
[39:20] not and when he said I am the god of
[39:23] Abraham he was saying I am the god of a
[39:26] living Abraham who's living right
[39:29] now that was Jesus's answer to the
[39:35] Sadducees so simple he could take the
[39:38] simplest scripture they all knew and
[39:40] probably learned as a memory verse at
[39:43] Sunday
[39:44] school all these great theologians and
[39:46] Sadducees they probably knew the story
[39:48] of Moses and the burning bush I mean
[39:51] even those who are in Israel who
[39:53] probably were illiterate knew that story
[39:55] yeah yeah amen and he goes right to a
[39:58] scripture they all know and proves that
[40:01] the dead are
[40:04] alive so what's the problem with the
[40:06] resurrection if they're not actually
[40:11] dead oh I love it when people think
[40:13] they're going to stump the word ah now
[40:16] I've got a question for you listen you
[40:18] may stump me but you never stump this
[40:20] word amen and your questions will never
[40:22] stop this
[40:24] message it's the word of God
[40:28] am man you
[40:29] remember when Saul King Saul got in
[40:34] trouble and he he was worried about his
[40:38] future he went to the winch of
[40:40] indor and the winch did what she called
[40:43] up
[40:44] Samuel Samuel wasn't
[40:47] dead Samuel had departed this Earth this
[40:50] Dimension he had left his body was
[40:53] rotting away he had no more breath in
[40:55] his lungs he he had no more animation in
[40:57] this body but Samuel was every bit alive
[41:00] as he has always been Samuel was no more
[41:03] dead than anything he was very much
[41:05] alive and his character was the same his
[41:07] temperament was the same and his office
[41:09] by God was the same he was still a
[41:12] prophet nothing had changed with Samuel
[41:15] except his Dwelling Place nothing else
[41:17] had
[41:19] changed what we call life is not life
[41:22] and we call death is not
[41:24] death amen I just love I love the word
[41:28] of God I love it because amen we have to
[41:33] stop for a minute and let the word
[41:35] reshape our
[41:38] thinking
[41:40] amen it says in the fourth seal brother
[41:43] BM says death is eternal
[41:47] separation so remember Saints don't die
[41:49] they sleep not die he that heareth my
[41:52] words and believeth on him that sent me
[41:54] has eternal life that's that's right
[41:56] shall not come into the Judgment but
[41:58] pass from death into life I am the
[42:00] resurrection and the life said Jesus he
[42:02] that believeth in me though he were dead
[42:04] yet shall he live and whosoever liveth
[42:06] and believeth in me shall never die amen
[42:09] says Lazarus dead he sleepeth fear not
[42:12] the girl is not dead but sleepeth they
[42:13] laugh him the scorn is that right oh my
[42:15] Saints don't die separation from God is
[42:19] death Eternal death and this fellow is
[42:21] called death so keep away from him and
[42:24] which my brother R referring to he's in
[42:25] the fourth seal and he's referring to
[42:27] the Antichrist he's referring to the
[42:29] fourth horse rider amen and the fourth
[42:32] horse rider riding the Pale Horse
[42:33] finally got a name it was the same horse
[42:36] rider all the way through he was
[42:37] changing his horses amen from a white
[42:39] horse to a black horse to a red horse
[42:41] now he's riding the Pale Horse and his
[42:43] name is death and what is he he's the
[42:46] Antichrist yeah is that right so the
[42:49] anti christ name is
[42:52] death and Christ is life cuz in in him
[42:56] is life amen and brother B said in the
[42:59] same in the same seal in the fourth seal
[43:01] he says now Jesus comes and and
[43:04] referring to Revelations 19 riding on a
[43:06] white horse and he said he's got a name
[43:08] that's
[43:09] life but if you go and read Revelations
[43:12] 19 amen there never says that his name
[43:15] is life in Revelations 19 it says his
[43:18] name is the word of God because in the
[43:21] word is life according to John
[43:24] 1:1 or John 13 or 4 whichever one it is
[43:28] so brother banham when he reads that and
[43:30] says on his thigh and on his vesture is
[43:32] a name written and on his thigh and his
[43:34] name is called the word of God brother
[43:36] Brenham says he comes with the name of
[43:39] life amen the Antichrist has the name of
[43:42] death but Christ has the name of Life
[43:44] why because he's the
[43:49] word and the word came from God and the
[43:52] Word was God Amen the word contained the
[43:54] thought of God so there was life life
[43:56] there amen but anything contrary to the
[43:59] word is death so Antichrist is death
[44:03] because death is anti- word right
[44:08] amen so what is life and death life is
[44:12] to align with the word death is to
[44:15] separate from the
[44:17] word it becomes so
[44:20] simple so let's let's write this down
[44:23] God is
[44:25] life
[44:27] and we know that
[44:29] life is in the
[44:32] word because he said in him was
[44:35] life so the word brings
[44:38] life Jesus said that his
[44:43] words were
[44:47] spirit and
[44:50] life so now we see what life is
[44:53] yeah amen life the original is God
[44:58] himself God is eternal life Zoey life is
[45:01] God's own life and as that life comes
[45:04] down into expression whatever contains
[45:07] the original thought of God also
[45:09] contains
[45:10] life all the attributes that were in
[45:13] God's thinking which is his family which
[45:15] are his children they also are part of
[45:18] eternal life and they are life they have
[45:21] life and life is in them because they're
[45:24] part of God
[45:27] now let's go over here to
[45:32] death brother brandom says death is
[45:38] separation this is the definition that
[45:40] he gives us and it's really interesting
[45:42] how he gives it to us so now we speak of
[45:46] when when this body fails to exist we
[45:48] stop breathing oxygen we're no longer
[45:50] animated amen the the soul leaves the
[45:53] body the spirit leaves the body and we
[45:55] say that's dead that's not a that's not
[45:57] a bad term it's not wrong to use that
[45:59] the Bible even uses that term because if
[46:01] you take death as separation then if you
[46:04] go to look at let's look at physical
[46:09] death physical
[46:12] death is when your
[46:15] soul is
[46:22] separated from the
[46:24] body
[46:28] got that yeah so death is
[46:31] separation So Physical death is when
[46:34] your soul separates from your body now
[46:37] that's physical
[46:38] death right that's not real death
[46:41] because that Soul's still alive right
[46:45] yeah just because the soul separated
[46:47] from the body doesn't mean the soul died
[46:49] yeah the soul is still alive amen so
[46:52] that's not true death that's not
[46:55] Ultimate Death death that's not the end
[46:57] of death so that means physical death is
[47:00] a shadow of death or a type of death
[47:04] right now let's go to spiritual
[47:09] death and we're going to explain all of
[47:12] these spiritual death is when your
[47:17] soul is
[47:20] separated from
[47:24] God
[47:28] you know we're born spiritually dead
[47:31] yeah amen we'll look at the scriptures
[47:33] that show us that why cuz our soul has
[47:36] to come in contact with God to Quicken
[47:38] the life
[47:40] amen now let's look
[47:44] at
[47:46] Eternal
[47:49] death so brother B says was our
[47:52] soul is
[47:54] destroyed
[47:59] in the Lake of
[48:02] Fire Eternal death is when our soul is
[48:06] destroyed and that's eternally separated
[48:10] from
[48:11] God what is death death is separation
[48:16] from
[48:18] Life the Antichrist is death because the
[48:21] Antichrist is to separate you from
[48:23] Christ whose life amen
[48:26] Christ is life Antichrist is
[48:29] death
[48:32] amen let's look at 1 Timothy
[48:45] 56 1 Timothy Chapter
[48:50] 5 in verse
[48:54] 6
[48:57] says but she that liveth in pleasure is
[49:00] dead while she
[49:02] liveth so she's very much alive but
[49:05] she's dead is she alive or
[49:09] dead amen you see the Dilemma she's
[49:12] living in pleasure but she's dead while
[49:15] she's alive amen what's she dead to
[49:18] she's spiritually dead she may have life
[49:21] in this Dimension she may be breathing
[49:23] amen she may be animated but but God
[49:26] says she's dead amen the woman that
[49:29] liveth in she that liveth in pleasure is
[49:31] dead while she liveth amen now let's go
[49:34] to Matthew
[49:37] 8 Matthew chapter
[49:45] 8 and verse
[49:52] 21 Matthew
[49:54] 8:21 says and another of his disciples
[49:57] said unto himl suffer me first to go
[49:58] bury my father but Jesus said unto him
[50:01] follow me and let the dead bury their
[50:05] dead Let the dead bury their dead right
[50:08] that's interesting if you do from a
[50:10] carnal understanding amen I can hear
[50:12] somebody just hearing Jesus say Let the
[50:14] dead bury the dead how are dead people
[50:17] going to take shovels and dig a hole
[50:18] amen they're dead how will they dig the
[50:21] hole to bury the dead how can the dead
[50:23] bury the dead so there must be some dead
[50:25] people who can dig holes
[50:29] still amen if any if if Jesus if he says
[50:33] what he says and means what he means and
[50:35] what he means makes sense we have to
[50:37] have another understanding other than
[50:39] the carnal understanding of what he's
[50:41] talking about because there have to be
[50:43] dead people that are able to bury dead
[50:46] people there's a dead man amen that can
[50:49] dig a shovel amen he looks alive he's
[50:52] breathing Amen in one sense of the word
[50:54] he's alive but in the truest sense of
[50:57] the word he's dead
[50:59] amen and he says just follow me Let the
[51:02] dead bury the dead and what is he
[51:04] speaking of he's speaking of those
[51:06] spiritually dead because their soul is
[51:08] separated from God let those that are
[51:10] dead bury those that aren't breathing
[51:12] anymore
[51:13] right Let the dead bury the
[51:17] dead see our whole understanding of life
[51:20] and death is so much more Superior than
[51:23] it used to be amen God
[51:25] brother bam says in the message pardon
[51:27] now the word death means separation when
[51:30] we die this way it does not mean our
[51:32] physical death does not mean that we are
[51:34] dead Jesus said he that believeth on me
[51:36] though he were dead yet shall he live
[51:38] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[51:39] shall never die now that death speaking
[51:42] of here is separation from the presence
[51:45] of God but the physical death that we
[51:47] have to go through here yet is not death
[51:50] we're still in the presence of God we've
[51:53] moved from this place to a closer place
[51:55] with him in his presence it isn't the
[51:58] death that we call death what we call it
[52:01] here amen now let's go to Luke
[52:07] 16 Luke 16 and
[52:10] 22 we we know these scriptures we all
[52:13] know them so well but I want to go
[52:14] through each one of us because I want us
[52:16] to have a scriptural understanding of
[52:18] what we're talking about because this is
[52:20] so solid through the
[52:22] scriptures Luke
[52:24] 16:22
[52:30] sorry I'm in Matthew that doesn't work
[52:34] Luke
[52:36] 16 and
[52:38] 22 and it came to pass that the beggar
[52:40] died and was carried by the Angels into
[52:42] Abraham's bosom and the rich man also
[52:44] died and was buried and in hell he
[52:47] lifted up his eyes being in torment and
[52:49] seeth Abram Abraham far off and Lazarus
[52:52] in his bosom and he cried and saith
[52:54] Father Abraham have Merc mercy on me and
[52:56] send Lazarus that he might dip the tip
[52:58] of his finger in water and cool my
[53:00] tongue for I am tormented in this flame
[53:03] but Abraham said Son remember that thou
[53:06] in thy lifetime receivest thy good
[53:08] things and likewise Lazarus evil things
[53:10] but now he is comforted and thou art
[53:12] tormented and beside all this between us
[53:15] and you there is a great Gulf fixed so
[53:17] that they which would pass from hence to
[53:19] you cannot neither can they pass to us
[53:22] that would come from then
[53:25] so here we have two men that
[53:28] die but they're not
[53:32] dead
[53:35] listen I I love oh my
[53:38] goodness let's read verse 22 again and
[53:40] it came to pass that the beggar died
[53:42] which is
[53:44] Lazarus amen and the rich man also
[53:48] died next verse and hell he lifted up
[53:51] his eyes and started
[53:54] talking he could see he could hear he
[53:58] could
[54:00] talk he wasn't dead he only left this
[54:03] Dimension amen he was still moving his
[54:06] body lay dead but he himself was very
[54:09] much alive and he was in one place and
[54:12] Lazarus was in another place and he
[54:14] could lift up his eyes being in torment
[54:16] and he could see Lazarus in Abraham's
[54:18] bosom and he could have a dialogue with
[54:20] Abraham he had reasoning he had eyesight
[54:23] he had sense of hearing amen he he he
[54:25] could speak he could feel torment he was
[54:29] hot Lazarus was comforted they weren't
[54:32] dead they were alive so this life after
[54:35] death is not just for the saints of God
[54:38] it's not just like the children of God
[54:40] are alive when they leave this earth
[54:42] everyone's still alive when they leave
[54:44] this
[54:45] earth some are alive some are dead alive
[54:49] and some are dead
[54:51] dead and while we're in this life amen
[54:54] some some are alive alive and some are
[54:56] dead dead and some are Dead Alive I
[54:58] don't I can't figure it all out in this
[55:01] life they're alive in this life and
[55:03] alive in the spirit some are alive in
[55:05] this life and dead in the
[55:07] spirit then when they both die you have
[55:10] one that's dead in the flesh but alive
[55:12] in the spirit you have another one
[55:14] that's dead in the flesh and still dead
[55:16] in the spirit but can talk and see and
[55:20] hear God
[55:23] amen amen am men things are not what
[55:27] they
[55:28] appear this is so much more than what we
[55:31] realize amen we could be alive we could
[55:35] be dead and it doesn't look any
[55:39] different then both are dead two caskets
[55:42] but they could be having a dialogue yeah
[55:46] right in another dimension
[55:49] amen praise God brother B said death
[55:53] means separation
[55:56] he only separates from our seeing but
[55:58] he's always alive he that heareth my
[56:01] words and believeth on him that sent me
[56:03] has everlasting life and shall never
[56:05] come into condemnation but is passed
[56:06] from death into life oh I believe that
[56:09] we can't die got eternal life eternal
[56:12] anything's Eternal never had a beginning
[56:14] or an end so that's God's own life
[56:17] eternal life comes from the Greek word
[56:18] Zoey which means God's own life and when
[56:22] we come Sons and Daughters of God the we
[56:25] live just as God Lives can no more die
[56:27] than he can die so we're part of him
[56:31] part of his life because we were part of
[56:33] the thought of
[56:35] god let's turn to Ephesians chapter
[56:40] 2 Ephesians chapter
[56:49] 2 Ephesians 2 and
[56:53] 1
[57:00] Ephesians 2 And1 and you hath he
[57:02] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[57:06] and
[57:07] sins amen what kind of dead was that
[57:10] that's when your soul was separated from
[57:12] the life of God you were dead in sins
[57:16] and trespasses you were walking on the
[57:18] earth you were breathing you were eating
[57:19] your meals you were talking to everybody
[57:21] but you were dead in sins and trespasses
[57:23] but he has quickened you
[57:25] amen amen and you have the quickened who
[57:28] were dead in trespasses and sins wherein
[57:30] in time past you walked according to the
[57:32] course of this world according to the
[57:34] prince of the power of the air the
[57:36] spirit that now worketh in the children
[57:38] of Disobedience among whom also we all
[57:40] had our conversation in times past and
[57:43] the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[57:45] desires of the Flesh and of the mind and
[57:47] were by Nature the children of Wrath
[57:49] even as others but God who is rich in
[57:52] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[57:54] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[57:58] hath quickened us together with Christ
[58:00] by Grace ye are saved and ha raised us
[58:03] up together and made us sit together in
[58:05] Heavenly places in Christ
[58:08] Jesus Hey listen friends I was
[58:13] dead but now I'm
[58:15] alive amen and not just alive but I want
[58:18] to confess to you now that I'm not just
[58:21] standing here behind this Pulpit but I'm
[58:23] seated in Heavenly place
[58:25] in Christ Jesus amen made so alive I've
[58:28] been quickened together with Christ it's
[58:31] far beyond what we see amen amen we
[58:34] we've come to life we were born in sin
[58:37] we were born dead through the things of
[58:39] God we were born with our mind darken to
[58:41] the things of God but by the grace of
[58:43] God he would come and he would flip on
[58:45] the switch there was a man that could
[58:47] turn on the light and when he turned on
[58:49] the light all of a sudden we could see
[58:51] and he quickened us who were dead in
[58:53] trespasses and and quickened us to life
[58:55] and we were alive and caught up and
[58:57] seated in Heavenly places in Christ
[59:02] Jesus you can never
[59:05] die you were already
[59:08] dead but men Made
[59:10] Alive let's go to chapter 4 Ephesians
[59:13] chapter 4 verse
[59:19] 17 Ephesians 4:17 this I say therefore
[59:22] and testify in the Lord that you
[59:25] henceforth walk not as other Gentiles
[59:26] walk in the vanity of their mind having
[59:29] the understanding darkened being
[59:31] alienated from the life of God through
[59:33] the ignorance that is in them because of
[59:35] the blindness of their heart what were
[59:38] they they were blind they were darkened
[59:40] they were darkened in their mind they
[59:41] were alien what were they alienated from
[59:43] they were alienated from the life of God
[59:46] so what were they they were dead because
[59:48] they were SE their soul was separated
[59:50] from the life of Goden but oh if your
[59:53] soul with a siede of of God and it ever
[59:56] comes in contact with that life of God
[59:58] again it'll Quicken you to life who were
[1:00:00] dead in trespasses and sin that's real
[1:00:05] life after that it doesn't matter
[1:00:08] anymore that happens to this life once
[1:00:10] we understand what life and death really
[1:00:12] is amen the devil can no more torment
[1:00:14] you with the fear of death which was the
[1:00:16] strength of sin which tormented men all
[1:00:18] their Liv it was job's torment it was
[1:00:20] his question it was it was a fear that
[1:00:22] was cast Over mankind but fear has been
[1:00:25] eliminated by genuine Life coming to us
[1:00:28] and now the devil can't torment us with
[1:00:30] death if you if you cause this body to
[1:00:33] die you only set my life free to live
[1:00:36] the better
[1:00:37] life you freed me from my chains of
[1:00:40] flash you got me out of the bondage amen
[1:00:42] of this fleshly body that was born in
[1:00:44] hybridization death can't hurt me death
[1:00:47] can only transfer me to where I long to
[1:00:49] be anyway the life in me continues in
[1:00:52] the life of God hallelujah
[1:00:55] there's no more fear in death amen
[1:00:57] there's no more fear that the de devil
[1:01:00] can hold over us because we were already
[1:01:04] dead remember the Antichrist is
[1:01:08] death death is not a heart attack right
[1:01:12] death is not when you quit breathing
[1:01:14] death is not drowning death is not a car
[1:01:16] that's not death death is the Antichrist
[1:01:19] who moves you away from the life of God
[1:01:21] Amen who will separate you from Christ
[1:01:24] that's death
[1:01:28] amen life is not enjoying the pleasures
[1:01:31] of this
[1:01:33] world life is coming in contact with
[1:01:38] God remember brother Bram said he was in
[1:01:40] the hotel one time and those women were
[1:01:43] drinking and they're going down and that
[1:01:44] one woman said whoopee this is
[1:01:47] living brother brandham said that's
[1:01:50] death and he quoted the scripture she
[1:01:51] that liveth in pleasure is dead yet
[1:01:54] while she liveth right a woman thought
[1:01:57] she had life she was in the midst of
[1:02:04] death praise
[1:02:06] God let's look at Ephesians chapter 5
[1:02:09] now verse
[1:02:15] 8 for ye were sometimes
[1:02:18] Darkness but now are you
[1:02:20] light in the Lord walk as children of
[1:02:24] the light you were sometimes Darkness
[1:02:27] why because your mind was dark to the
[1:02:29] things of God you were alienated from
[1:02:30] the life of God because the ignorance
[1:02:32] that was in you you were Darkness but
[1:02:35] now are you
[1:02:37] light why
[1:02:39] because in him was life and that life
[1:02:43] was the light of men and in that word
[1:02:46] was Life Zoey life and that life come to
[1:02:48] us when we received the word and that
[1:02:50] life was the light of men we were
[1:02:51] sometimes Darkness but now are we light
[1:02:54] in the the Lord let's go to John chapter
[1:03:08] 5 John chapter 5:
[1:03:15] 24 John 5 and 24 says verily verily I
[1:03:19] say unto you he that heareth my word and
[1:03:22] believeth on him that sent me ha
[1:03:24] everlasting life see that word
[1:03:27] haath hath already in possession
[1:03:32] of he that heareth my word and believeth
[1:03:36] on him that sent me hath everlasting
[1:03:38] life and shall not come into
[1:03:40] condemnation but is passed from Death
[1:03:43] unto life verily verily I say unto you
[1:03:46] the hour is coming and now is when the
[1:03:48] dead shall hear the voice of the Son of
[1:03:50] God and they that hear shall live
[1:03:55] for as the father have life in himself
[1:03:57] so hath he given to the son to have life
[1:04:00] in
[1:04:01] himself praise be to God you know what I
[1:04:05] love says I say unto you the hour is
[1:04:07] coming and now
[1:04:10] is when the dead shall hear the voice of
[1:04:14] God and those that hear the voice of God
[1:04:17] the dead shall hear the voice of go of
[1:04:19] the Son of God and they that hear shall
[1:04:23] live amen
[1:04:25] oh praise God I was dead the time was
[1:04:28] coming but now is now in this generation
[1:04:30] amen there was death there was spiritual
[1:04:32] death there was religious death but we
[1:04:34] have heard the voice of the Son of God
[1:04:36] and they that were dead are alive
[1:04:40] amen hey praise be to God Amen they that
[1:04:44] dead shall hear the voice of the Son of
[1:04:46] God and they that hear shall
[1:04:51] live how do you hear you have to have
[1:04:53] ears toar
[1:04:54] he and that's the grace of
[1:04:59] God brother B says in questions and
[1:05:01] answerers he says that is a beautiful
[1:05:03] type to show that through the woman
[1:05:04] through natural birth we all have to die
[1:05:07] because we're dead to begin with and
[1:05:10] only through the man Christ Jesus can we
[1:05:13] live why because he has life in himself
[1:05:16] amen so now when we receive Christ we
[1:05:18] receive life amen we were dead we were
[1:05:21] born dead we come into the world in a
[1:05:23] hybrid condition our minds darkened to
[1:05:26] the things of God under spiritual
[1:05:27] Amnesia alienated from the life of God
[1:05:30] separated by the ignorance that was in
[1:05:32] us but then the light of Life comes and
[1:05:37] quickens the seed to life and we were
[1:05:40] dead and sin trespasses has he
[1:05:43] quickened brother R says it this way in
[1:05:45] thinking man's filter he says notice the
[1:05:47] word cannot die deny itself when then
[1:05:51] it's satisfied or it's the it's the
[1:05:53] desire it's a desire of what what made
[1:05:55] you desire it in the first place because
[1:05:58] down in your soul there was a
[1:06:00] predestinated seed which was eternal
[1:06:02] life always laying in there always was
[1:06:06] in
[1:06:07] there what was in that Cene of God
[1:06:10] eternal life where was it it was in the
[1:06:13] C Gene of God in your soul when was put
[1:06:16] there brother BR said before the
[1:06:17] foundation of the world Amen and the
[1:06:19] thought of God is the gene of God is the
[1:06:21] seed of God and the thought is eternal
[1:06:24] that's eternal life and it's laying in
[1:06:26] the seed but it's it's in a dead
[1:06:29] condition the seed is dormant it's not
[1:06:31] active it's laying there it's waiting to
[1:06:33] come to life it's got to be quickened by
[1:06:35] what it must come in contact with the
[1:06:38] life of God and when it comes in contact
[1:06:40] with the life of God the life on the
[1:06:42] inside will Spring forth the life life
[1:06:45] must connect with life word must connect
[1:06:47] with word eagle has to come to Eagle
[1:06:52] Hallelujah to Quicken it to
[1:06:55] life so where is the eternal life it's
[1:06:59] in the seed what comes to the seed
[1:07:02] eternal life amen the life of God where
[1:07:06] was the word it was in you a thought of
[1:07:08] God an attribute of God that part of the
[1:07:10] word was already in you waiting to be
[1:07:13] expressed but the word was there had to
[1:07:15] come into expression so it took the word
[1:07:17] to bring the word into expression
[1:07:21] am that's how we were dead because our
[1:07:24] soul was separated from God Amen but
[1:07:27] when it comes back in contact with God
[1:07:29] it Springs to
[1:07:31] life let's go to Romans chapter
[1:07:49] 6 therefore we are buried with him by
[1:07:52] baptism un death that like as Christ was
[1:07:55] raised up from the dead by the glory of
[1:07:56] the father even so we also should walk
[1:07:58] in newness of life for if we've been
[1:08:01] planted together in the likeness of his
[1:08:03] death we shall be also in the likeness
[1:08:06] of his resurrection knowing this that
[1:08:08] our old man is crucified with him that
[1:08:10] the body of sin might be destroyed that
[1:08:12] henceforth we should not serve sin for
[1:08:15] he that is dead is freed from sin now if
[1:08:19] we be dead with Christ we believe that
[1:08:21] we shall also live with him knowing that
[1:08:25] Christ being raised from the dead dieth
[1:08:27] no more death hath no more dominion over
[1:08:29] him for in that he died he died and sin
[1:08:32] once but in that he liveth he liveth
[1:08:33] unto God likewise reckon ye also
[1:08:36] yourselves to be dead indeed into sin
[1:08:39] but alive unto God through Jesus Christ
[1:08:41] Our Lord so now we who are dead in sins
[1:08:44] and trespasses as he quickened the life
[1:08:47] now he's telling us that we need to
[1:08:49] reckon ourselves dead to be alive in
[1:08:52] Christ now there has to be an we were
[1:08:54] already dead but he made alive but to be
[1:08:57] alive we have to make ourselves
[1:09:02] dead what is death separation so now
[1:09:06] what do we need to reckon ourselves we
[1:09:09] are dead to our old life we are dead to
[1:09:11] the Natural men we are dead to what we
[1:09:13] were born at we are dead to the world we
[1:09:16] are dead to the things of the world we
[1:09:17] have to separate from our old life and
[1:09:20] consider the old man now dead to be
[1:09:22] entered into life life we have to
[1:09:25] separate from the old and reckon
[1:09:27] ourselves now dead crucified with Christ
[1:09:30] dead and buried in the waters of baptism
[1:09:33] and come forth a new creature because I
[1:09:35] in order to resurrect I have to
[1:09:39] die and so now I have to separate from
[1:09:42] my old life and that is a form of death
[1:09:46] bringing forth
[1:09:47] life Colossians 3:3 says ye for ye are
[1:09:52] dead and your life life is hid with
[1:09:54] Christ and God I thought brother Chad
[1:09:57] you said if you're hid with Christ
[1:09:58] you're alive no my soul's alive I'm
[1:10:00] alive amen but this man I reckon dead
[1:10:03] amen I'm separating from the flesh to
[1:10:06] have life this to me is dead my old
[1:10:08] nature my old life I'm dying to that to
[1:10:11] have the real life
[1:10:15] amen amen and the Rapture brother B says
[1:10:18] then how do we get into this body 1
[1:10:23] Corinthians by one Spirit we're all
[1:10:25] baptized into this body by one Holy
[1:10:28] Spirit
[1:10:29] baptism that if you want to put that
[1:10:31] down it's 1 Corinthians 12:13 and by one
[1:10:33] Spirit we're all baptized and the spirit
[1:10:35] is the Life of Christ is that right the
[1:10:39] Life of Christ and the life of any seed
[1:10:42] which he was the word seed brings the
[1:10:44] seed to life you get it if the that life
[1:10:48] is laying in the seed and the baptism of
[1:10:51] the Holy Spirit comes upon it it's bound
[1:10:53] to bring that Seed
[1:10:56] Life where was the life laying in the
[1:10:59] seed what came to this life life yeah
[1:11:03] and it quickened me from Death unto
[1:11:07] life
[1:11:09] now beat me burn me drag me behind
[1:11:12] horses you can't kill me right you can
[1:11:15] take breath out of my body you can take
[1:11:17] this body and lay it down with no more
[1:11:20] animation and no more seemingly life in
[1:11:22] it but you can't kill me because my life
[1:11:24] is hid in
[1:11:26] Christ I've already reckoned myself Dead
[1:11:30] Brother BR said in the rising of the sun
[1:11:32] he said this real Eagle recognizes the
[1:11:34] call of God's word why he's an eagle an
[1:11:37] eagle to an eagle amen what was it that
[1:11:40] woke up the eagle in the chicken yard it
[1:11:42] was an eagle that woke up the
[1:11:44] eagle it took an eagle to wake up an
[1:11:47] eagle amen what does it do to take up
[1:11:49] the word it takes the word to wake up
[1:11:51] the word it takes life to come to life
[1:11:53] Amen to wake it up the eagle to an eagle
[1:11:56] the word before the foundation the word
[1:11:59] to the word the word predestinated
[1:12:02] that's in my soul to the word written
[1:12:05] for the
[1:12:06] hour what brings you to life the word
[1:12:10] predestinated amen in the word written
[1:12:12] for that hour when the word written for
[1:12:14] that hour comes in contact with the word
[1:12:15] predestinated it quickens it to life
[1:12:18] like the eagle to the eagle that's why
[1:12:20] this message brings a seed for this day
[1:12:23] it brings it to life amen amen cuz it's
[1:12:27] not an
[1:12:29] antichrist death it's
[1:12:32] Christ the word of God which is life
[1:12:37] amen this word that's been given in this
[1:12:39] generation is life this message is life
[1:12:43] because this message is Christ it's not
[1:12:46] Antichrist the denominations are
[1:12:48] Antichrist all the ideas and Creeds of
[1:12:50] man are Antichrist that's all death
[1:12:55] but Christ the word of God is life
[1:13:00] amen and that word of God in this age
[1:13:03] amen the word written for this age
[1:13:07] brings the predestinated seed for this
[1:13:09] age to life and that's real
[1:13:15] life when our babies are born we hold
[1:13:19] them in our arms they've come into this
[1:13:21] world they're they're a living Soul they
[1:13:24] they've got breath in their bodies and
[1:13:25] we say you were just born they're alive
[1:13:29] the sad part is they were born dead yeah
[1:13:32] right that's the real tragedy of life
[1:13:35] amen the little children that we hold
[1:13:37] and we CLE they were born Dead with
[1:13:40] their mind darkened to the things of God
[1:13:42] alienated from the life of
[1:13:45] God but oh we have a
[1:13:48] hope that by the mercy of God that they
[1:13:51] can come to life amen because that birth
[1:13:55] is not real life the new birth is real
[1:13:57] life that's why they have to have a new
[1:13:59] birth that's why you must be born again
[1:14:01] your first birth birthed you into death
[1:14:04] your new birth birthed you into life
[1:14:07] amen that's true life amen so what is
[1:14:11] life connecting with God what is death
[1:14:15] separation from
[1:14:18] God brother B says in Jehovah Gyra he
[1:14:21] says this isn't for unbeliever
[1:14:24] they never will see it they are dead to
[1:14:27] begin
[1:14:28] with they're already dead we were
[1:14:31] already
[1:14:32] dead but he quickened
[1:14:35] us he says but unbelievers receive
[1:14:37] nothing it's not for them they're dead
[1:14:40] to begin with they never was even
[1:14:42] represented there is nothing in them
[1:14:44] they're dead holes there's not even a
[1:14:48] predestinated seed on the inside to
[1:14:49] receive it by oh that's why if we can
[1:14:52] receive this word we should rejoiced
[1:14:53] more than anybody else on this Earth
[1:14:55] rejoices because we weren't a dead hole
[1:14:58] amen we were we were in deadness we were
[1:15:00] in the darkness we were dead in sins and
[1:15:02] trespasses but oh praise God there was
[1:15:04] life down on the
[1:15:06] inside amen it was laying there dark and
[1:15:08] dormant and separated from the life of
[1:15:10] God but God in his great Mercy amen
[1:15:13] would send the light our way would send
[1:15:15] the word would send the life and when
[1:15:17] those two made contact with one another
[1:15:19] it quickened us from death unto life
[1:15:21] amen never to die
[1:15:24] [Music]
[1:15:25] God but it's not so with the rest of the
[1:15:30] world we were we were part of the first
[1:15:34] death but we will never be part of the
[1:15:37] second
[1:15:38] death that's why the Bible talks about a
[1:15:41] second death yes remember death is
[1:15:44] separation we were born dead then
[1:15:46] brought to life and if we were born dead
[1:15:49] and brought to life we could never be in
[1:15:51] the second death because we've already
[1:15:54] received
[1:15:55] life let's look at Revelation chap 20
[1:16:00] together we're going to close with this
[1:16:02] with this
[1:16:09] thought Revelations 20 we're coming to
[1:16:12] the white Throne judgment in this part
[1:16:13] of the scriptures Revelation 20:4 says
[1:16:16] and I saw Thrones and they that sat upon
[1:16:18] them and judgment was given unto them
[1:16:20] and I saw the souls of them that were
[1:16:22] beheaded for the w of Jesus for the word
[1:16:24] of God which had not worshiped the Beast
[1:16:26] neither his image neither had received
[1:16:29] his Mark upon their foreheads or in
[1:16:31] their hands and they lived and reigned
[1:16:32] with Christ a thousand years that's the
[1:16:35] Millennium but the rest of the Dead live
[1:16:38] not again under the thousand years were
[1:16:39] finished this is the first
[1:16:43] resurrection then it says blessed and
[1:16:45] holy is he that hath part in the First
[1:16:47] Resurrection on such the second death
[1:16:50] hath no power but they shall be Priests
[1:16:52] of God God and of Christ and shall reign
[1:16:54] with him a thousand years so those are
[1:16:57] already those who came to life they'll
[1:16:59] be in the first resurrection they'll
[1:17:01] Rule and reign with Christ for a
[1:17:02] thousand years and the second death has
[1:17:04] no power on them because they've already
[1:17:07] passed from Death unto
[1:17:09] life amen and then further down let's
[1:17:13] let's go continue down a little bit
[1:17:14] further and this is where we come to the
[1:17:16] white Throne
[1:17:17] judgment and I saw a great white throne
[1:17:20] and him that sat on it from whose face
[1:17:22] the Earth and the heaven fled away and
[1:17:25] there was found no place for them and I
[1:17:27] saw the dead small and great stand
[1:17:29] before God and the books were open and
[1:17:32] another book was open which is The Book
[1:17:34] of Life and the dead were judged out of
[1:17:37] those things which were written in the
[1:17:38] books according to their works and the
[1:17:41] Sea gave up the dead that was in them
[1:17:44] and death and Hell delivered up the dead
[1:17:45] which were in them and they were judged
[1:17:47] every man according to their works and
[1:17:49] death and hell were cast into the Lake
[1:17:50] of Fire this is the second second death
[1:17:54] and whosoever was not found written in
[1:17:56] the Book of Life was cast into the Lake
[1:17:59] of
[1:18:01] Fire now we come to the white Throne
[1:18:03] judgment and it says of the white Throne
[1:18:05] judgment I saw the dead small and great
[1:18:08] stand before
[1:18:10] God they were standing before
[1:18:13] God they're not what we could consider
[1:18:16] dead dead means laid flat no breathing
[1:18:18] you know no no they were standing they
[1:18:20] were animated they were moving but they
[1:18:22] were dead this was all the dead these
[1:18:24] are all those who haven't been born
[1:18:26] again amen they were like we were before
[1:18:29] the New Birth came amen all the rest of
[1:18:32] the Dead were standing there before God
[1:18:34] and now this is the Judgment of the dead
[1:18:37] and the Sea gave up the dead and
[1:18:39] everything gave up the dead and the dead
[1:18:40] are here to judge but praise God some of
[1:18:43] them will go into the second death some
[1:18:46] of the Dead will enter into life at the
[1:18:48] white Throne judgment amen praise be to
[1:18:50] God hallelujah why because of the works
[1:18:53] that they did according to what was
[1:18:55] written in the books and here's what
[1:18:56] brother BR says about this in the samon
[1:18:59] church age from the church age book he
[1:19:01] said the question now arises why are
[1:19:03] these righteous ones in judgment because
[1:19:05] we know some are judged righteous in
[1:19:07] this judging of the
[1:19:09] Dead why are they dead because they
[1:19:11] weren't born again they didn't receive
[1:19:12] the life of God
[1:19:15] Amen he said there is no other place
[1:19:17] that they can come up why are they here
[1:19:19] there's no other place they can come up
[1:19:21] they couldn't be in the first
[1:19:22] Resurrection because that's the
[1:19:24] resurrection of
[1:19:27] life but for they are but two
[1:19:29] resurrections and since they could not
[1:19:30] qualify for the first resurrection they
[1:19:33] must come up in the second which is a
[1:19:35] resurrection unto
[1:19:36] judgment the ones who qualify for the
[1:19:39] first resurrection the bride are not in
[1:19:41] the Judgment John 5:24 says verily
[1:19:44] verily I say unto you he that heareth my
[1:19:46] word and believeth on him that sent me
[1:19:48] ha everlasting life that is the believer
[1:19:51] is already the recipient of eternal life
[1:19:54] which he has in his possession now and
[1:19:58] shall not come into condemnation and
[1:20:00] brother B says again shall not come into
[1:20:01] the Judgment it is what it really says
[1:20:05] but is pasted and then he interjects
[1:20:07] permanently from Death unto life but
[1:20:11] notice carefully Jesus must have yet
[1:20:14] another group in mind who at a certain
[1:20:17] Resurrection will receive eternal life
[1:20:20] they will receive it at the resurrection
[1:20:22] not not having previously received it as
[1:20:25] a member of the
[1:20:28] Bride
[1:20:30] amen he says he goes on down a little
[1:20:32] further says but it says in John 5:28-29
[1:20:36] that all are going to come forth from
[1:20:38] the grave said that's not the first
[1:20:41] resurrection because the first
[1:20:42] resurrection only the seed of God comes
[1:20:45] out of the Grave so this is the second
[1:20:49] Resurrection this is the very same
[1:20:50] resurrection that is spoken of in
[1:20:52] Revelation 20 11 to5 where the dead were
[1:20:55] brought before the Lord and judged
[1:20:56] according to their works and all those
[1:20:58] names were not in the Book of Life were
[1:21:00] then cast into the Lake of
[1:21:02] Fire he goes on further down in the
[1:21:05] sardan church age he said thus the grain
[1:21:07] of wheat that became a plant for the
[1:21:09] Harvest is the record of the church and
[1:21:12] even as not all of the wheat plant is
[1:21:14] wheat seed is not all of the plant is
[1:21:15] used in the Harvest so the church all
[1:21:18] the church is not the bride and neither
[1:21:20] is it all given eternal life but part of
[1:21:23] it is gathered into the Garner and part
[1:21:25] of it is kept that it might enter into
[1:21:28] eternal life in the second resurrection
[1:21:31] and part of it which is a count of chaff
[1:21:33] is burned in the Lake of
[1:21:37] Fire death is not what we think death is
[1:21:39] and life is not what we call
[1:21:42] Life Death is separation from
[1:21:45] God life is entering into
[1:21:51] God here we we see a great mystery
[1:21:54] brother R teaches us in the church age a
[1:21:56] great mystery about those who are
[1:21:58] granted life at the white Throne
[1:22:01] judgment they're not the seed of God
[1:22:03] they're not like you and I who already
[1:22:05] have eternal life in the SE genene
[1:22:08] they're considered dead because we were
[1:22:10] considered dead but we had something in
[1:22:11] us that could receive the word and
[1:22:14] because of that we were born
[1:22:16] again none of these in the second re
[1:22:19] Resurrection were born
[1:22:21] again but some of them are in the Book
[1:22:25] of Life yes is that right amen some of
[1:22:29] them are in the Book of Life not part of
[1:22:32] the Bride but they're there as an aid
[1:22:35] and a help Amen in working with the word
[1:22:37] and working for God and working
[1:22:39] conjunction with the life of God and
[1:22:41] because they worked to support the life
[1:22:43] of God and worked with the word of God
[1:22:45] and worked with the people of God God
[1:22:47] though they don't previously have life
[1:22:50] in themselves like the bride did amen
[1:22:52] they're granted to enter into life now
[1:22:55] they can come into the realm of God into
[1:22:58] the realm of eternals and enjoy
[1:23:01] life what is death separation from God
[1:23:04] what is life connection with
[1:23:07] God now these get to enter into life not
[1:23:12] previously having had it as a member of
[1:23:14] the
[1:23:15] Bride
[1:23:18] oh life is
[1:23:20] wonderful not this life life when we
[1:23:24] look around friends this world is
[1:23:25] falling
[1:23:26] apart what we've we we could say that
[1:23:29] we've had a good life we lived in
[1:23:31] America we've had jobs we've we've had
[1:23:33] trials we've had difficulties but we
[1:23:35] could say we've had a good life hey but
[1:23:36] it's not always going to stay this way
[1:23:38] it's getting worse and worse and harder
[1:23:39] and harder but this isn't life amen this
[1:23:42] is not life this is death all around us
[1:23:45] we're immersed in death but life is the
[1:23:47] life of God that's the reality that we
[1:23:50] hold in our heart we've already entered
[1:23:52] into life we've already entered into
[1:23:54] Heavenly places and Inter seated with
[1:23:55] Christ Jesus we're in life and life is
[1:23:57] in us what happens in this world is not
[1:24:01] our life our life is hid in
[1:24:03] Christ that's
[1:24:06] life that's why we don't get
[1:24:08] disappointed with life we get so
[1:24:10] discouraged and disappointed with life I
[1:24:11] say God help me to get my eyes off of
[1:24:14] this realm and think eternally cuz I
[1:24:17] still get so disappointed in life
[1:24:19] discouraged I want a good life I want an
[1:24:21] easy life this life is not
[1:24:25] life it's a reflection of life it's a
[1:24:28] type of life but I want to live for the
[1:24:31] real
[1:24:33] life we fear
[1:24:36] death but if you've had life you can't
[1:24:40] die there's no death to
[1:24:43] fear remember when brother bam went to
[1:24:46] the side of his dying wife amen he he
[1:24:49] had to struggle through the flood to
[1:24:51] find his way to a hospital she had been
[1:24:53] transported and moved and and he found
[1:24:55] her just as she had passed away she
[1:24:57] walks up to her and she's already she's
[1:24:59] already dead hope is already gone and he
[1:25:02] calls her
[1:25:05] back you know she died for what we call
[1:25:11] death but brother Brenham calls her back
[1:25:14] and the first thing she says to him is
[1:25:16] oh thank you for saving me thank you for
[1:25:19] bringing me back to life no the first
[1:25:21] thing she says this why did you call me
[1:25:28] back oh praise God I love these things
[1:25:32] Amen to me this is becoming the reality
[1:25:34] more and more in my life I'm not afraid
[1:25:37] to die death is a release I'm living
[1:25:39] here to serve God's purpose not for my
[1:25:41] own pleasure not to soak up all I can
[1:25:44] out of this life and have fun and run
[1:25:45] around to amusement parks that's not why
[1:25:48] I'm here I am here to serve God's
[1:25:50] purpose but when I escape this life I
[1:25:52] enter into a greater life amen the real
[1:25:55] life what I've longed to enter into all
[1:25:57] my
[1:25:58] life this is a dim reflection of life
[1:26:02] life is beyond
[1:26:04] this here comes a woman amen and when
[1:26:07] she died she's leaving back in this
[1:26:09] Dimension an 8-month-old baby and an
[1:26:12] baby girl and an 18month old baby boy
[1:26:15] can you imagine being a mother a mother
[1:26:18] who's nursing a baby an 8-month old baby
[1:26:21] amen girl and and 18-month old with a
[1:26:23] husband that she loves dearly amen and
[1:26:25] when she dies and she goes on beyond the
[1:26:27] Mortal realm and her husband calls her
[1:26:29] back she doesn't say oh thank you you
[1:26:31] saved me I was dead and you brought me
[1:26:33] back she said why did you bring me
[1:26:38] back she tells brother B she says you
[1:26:40] know that life that Holy Ghost you
[1:26:42] preach about it's real it's more real
[1:26:44] than your real lifee and she said I'm
[1:26:45] going now amen and she wasn't she wasn't
[1:26:48] sad she wasn't upset she said you know
[1:26:51] I'm going she goes that Holy Ghost you
[1:26:53] preached stick with it amen promise me
[1:26:55] you won't leave it it's more real than
[1:26:57] you realize amen cuz she was entering in
[1:27:00] to the word amen she was entering into
[1:27:02] the promise she was entering into what
[1:27:03] was preached and it was more glorious
[1:27:05] than anything she had ever experienced
[1:27:07] in this
[1:27:10] life the final thing she

[1:28:00] stop the depression and stop the
[1:28:02] disappointment and stop the
[1:28:03] discouragement because you know what
[1:28:05] this depression and disappointment
[1:28:06] discouragement is it's because we don't
[1:28:08] have the kind of life we want to have
[1:28:10] we're trying to make a better life and
[1:28:12] we get discouraged CU I didn't get what
[1:28:14] I wanted and I don't feel good in this
[1:28:15] life and my goodness we got to say I'm
[1:28:18] not here for that
[1:28:20] purpose that's it's not real life the
[1:28:23] best that we have here is nothing
[1:28:25] compared to
[1:28:30] life in the fifth
[1:28:33] seal brother Brenham is telling us about
[1:28:36] going beyond the curtain of
[1:28:38] time and he goes into the sixth
[1:28:41] Dimension and he looks back at his body
[1:28:45] and his body's laying on the bed he's
[1:28:48] standing on green grass somewhere in the
[1:28:51] vicinity of his house he's entered into
[1:28:54] another dimension he's entered into life
[1:28:56] beyond life amen and he's very much
[1:28:59] alive he's hugging people talking to
[1:29:01] them shaking their hands embracing them
[1:29:03] they're alive they're very real he can
[1:29:05] handle them and talk to them he can feel
[1:29:07] the feelings amen he can sense the
[1:29:10] senses and he looks back at his body
[1:29:12] laying there and he says huh I must have
[1:29:14] had a heart
[1:29:16] attack he's not disappointed he's not
[1:29:19] upset he's not saying oh I feel feel so
[1:29:22] sorry that I had a heart attack he just
[1:29:24] says oh I must have had a heart attack
[1:29:25] or something and listen the the the
[1:29:28] thing that's mysterious to me about all
[1:29:29] of this when he looks back at that what
[1:29:32] he assumes is a dead body laying on that
[1:29:34] it's laying next to his wife that he
[1:29:36] loves so much and he's not saying God
[1:29:38] send me back let me go back there's
[1:29:39] something so much more real in this
[1:29:42] Dimension that he's not begging to go
[1:29:44] back to an inferior life he's entered
[1:29:46] into life
[1:29:48] amen he has dialogue and discussions and
[1:29:51] then all the sudden he feels a funny
[1:29:53] feeling and when he feels that feeling
[1:29:54] he looks back and he sees his body
[1:29:56] moving on the bed and he says I don't
[1:29:58] have to go back do
[1:30:02] I I wonder how his wife felt about this
[1:30:04] whole
[1:30:09] experience because when he looked back
[1:30:11] and he saw his body moving on the bed
[1:30:14] just next to him was his

[1:35:58] remain I want to live for the Eternal
[1:36:01] not for the temporal you know that's the
[1:36:04] challenge of our hour We're Not
[1:36:07] challenged maybe necessarily with severe
[1:36:09] persecution we're not challenged with
[1:36:11] arrest and imprisonment we're not
[1:36:13] challenged sometimes with the things
[1:36:14] that previous ages have been challenged
[1:36:16] with here in America we're not even
[1:36:18] challenged with poverty and hardship
[1:36:20] that way
[1:36:22] you know we're challenged with Easy
[1:36:25] Living that's our challenge our
[1:36:28] challenge is a lay to see and condition
[1:36:30] our challenge is we get everything we
[1:36:34] want that's our
[1:36:38] Challenge and can we forsake that to
[1:36:40] have
[1:36:42] life you know why the rest of the world
[1:36:44] wants to come to America because they
[1:36:46] want a better
[1:36:48] life CU they think a car and a house and
[1:36:51] medical coverage and clean clean
[1:36:54] environment that's a better life that
[1:36:56] may be a better natural life but this
[1:36:58] isn't life friends if we want a better
[1:37:00] life we'll find a better life right here
[1:37:03] in the word of God that's the better
[1:37:05] life and those of us who are here in
[1:37:07] America we're still trying to have a
[1:37:08] better life and a better life and a
[1:37:10] better life but my better life is found
[1:37:12] in the message of the hour and the word
[1:37:13] of God that's given me a better life and
[1:37:16] that's real life and that's what I want
[1:37:18] to put all my effort into and all I say
[1:37:21] is God help me I'm not yet where I want
[1:37:24] to be but God help me give me the eyes
[1:37:27] have to see the reality and strive for
[1:37:30] thaten God bless you let's bow our heads
[1:37:33] and pray
[1:37:34] together Lord Jesus we thank you Father
[1:37:36] for your goodness to
[1:37:38] us God your word has Stripped Away all
[1:37:42] the false realities that are around
[1:37:45] us God what we thought was real we found
[1:37:47] out wasn't real what we thought was
[1:37:50] stable isn't
[1:37:52] stable God what we've touched and held
[1:37:55] and the air that we've breathed and the
[1:37:57] life that we supposedly lived in the
[1:38:00] flesh none of that was the reality Lord
[1:38:04] all of this has proved to be a shadow a
[1:38:07] vapor a Mist that quickly Fades
[1:38:12] away God I pray that you'd help us to
[1:38:14] move out from this Shadow from the
[1:38:18] negative and help us to move into the
[1:38:20] positive
[1:38:22] God you sent a message in our day you
[1:38:24] brought a prophet to come and bring us
[1:38:26] back in contact with the reality of your
[1:38:29] word God so that we would know what the
[1:38:31] truth really
[1:38:33] is that you've presented to us in this
[1:38:36] day true
[1:38:38] life genuine life to save us from true
[1:38:44] death God I pray that you would save
[1:38:46] your
[1:38:48] children God awaken us to a greater
[1:38:50] reality
[1:38:52] bring us from more from Darkness into
[1:38:55] light God all those false ideas and
[1:38:58] false Notions the fears that still grip
[1:39:00] us the troubles that we still have in
[1:39:03] this life I pray God that your
[1:39:05] illumination of your word would Lift Us
[1:39:07] above those things to where they
[1:39:10] wouldn't have such a grip on us Lord but
[1:39:13] this world will fade into the
[1:39:16] dimness as the bright light of your
[1:39:18] reality grows and grows in US
[1:39:21] we thank you for
[1:39:23] life you came that we might have life
[1:39:26] and to have it more
[1:39:28] abundantly God you come and brought us
[1:39:30] the reality of life which is
[1:39:34] yourself God help us to partake of more
[1:39:36] of that life day by day help us to grow
[1:39:39] into that light into that life and leave
[1:39:42] the Dismal World
[1:39:45] Behind Lord help us to reckon ourselves
[1:39:48] now
[1:39:49] dead to reckon ourselves dead dead to
[1:39:52] the flesh dead to the world dead to what
[1:39:55] we used to call reality and life help us
[1:39:58] to be dead to that but alive in Christ
[1:40:02] Jesus God your word is so good to
[1:40:05] us God we're so
[1:40:07] thankful that we are candidates for the
[1:40:10] first
[1:40:11] resurrection because it's a resurrection
[1:40:13] of life and we have received your life
[1:40:17] you've taken away everything that would
[1:40:19] frighten us Lord
[1:40:21] and brought us into the reality we love
[1:40:24] you for it
[1:40:25] Lord God I pray if there's any of your
[1:40:28] seed laying out there with life in them
[1:40:31] but is dead in trespasses and sin I pray
[1:40:34] you would go to them Lord you'd bring
[1:40:36] the illumination of your word over them
[1:40:38] and Lord would you be a man here that
[1:40:41] can turn on the lights and flip on the
[1:40:44] light in their soul and bring
[1:40:46] illumination and awaken that seed and
[1:40:49] Quicken it to life that they might
[1:40:52] understand the reality of Life Lord
[1:40:55] would you do the work I pray God Lord
[1:40:58] forgive us for our nearsight inness
[1:41:00] forgive us Lord for holding on to the
[1:41:03] rudiments of this world but help us God
[1:41:05] to break free
[1:41:08] completely God as soon as hope saw the
[1:41:12] other side she was ready to let go of
[1:41:14] everything over here she was ready to
[1:41:17] let go of relationships let go of
[1:41:19] Earthly loves the let go of a husband
[1:41:21] and children things that are the dearest
[1:41:24] things in our life we can't even
[1:41:26] comprehend how we could turn loose of
[1:41:28] them but God as soon as she stepped into
[1:41:30] a greater reality of life she was
[1:41:33] willing to give it all
[1:41:35] up God help us not wait till we die in
[1:41:39] this life to come into that greater
[1:41:42] reality but help us Lord to take our
[1:41:44] hands off of everything and let go of
[1:41:47] everything in this world and let you
[1:41:49] lead us and have us and guide us and use
