TRANSCRIPT
========================================
well I'm one of the few I'm one of the few and my faith in God's word I can claim it and though the way may seem long and the opposition strong for the bride there's a way robited and if I plan to go through Mr hope will not do I must be firmly decided to follow the Lord by obeying his word and believe that I'm once a few years away provided and if I plan to go through just to hope will not do I must be firmly decided to follow the Lord by obeying his word and believe that I'm one of the few thank you and if I plan to go through just to hope will not do I must be firmly decided to follow the Lord by obey his word and believe that I'm one of the few well God has got a bride that's marching through the sled with praises in her mouth and healing in her hand there's Everlasting joy and gladness in her heart and in this bride I've got apart well God has got a bride that's marching through this land through its Praises in her mouth and peeling at her hand Everlasting joy and gladness in her heart and in this bride I've got a part one more time God has got a bride that's marching through this land with praises in her mouth and healing at her hand Everlasting door and gladness in her heart in this bright I'm out of heart amen good evening God bless you you can all be seated just for a moment amen as you know we've got brother Noel Johnson ministering for us this evening so we're very glad to have him back with us again he and his wife sister Shirley God bless you Sister Shirley amen they become good friends of ours and we're always glad to see him come by it's always about this time of year that they come up to work and put their support behind the believer's youth camp in Indiana and so often it works out the way they can stop in so we're glad it worked out this time and with him taking the Wednesday night service it gave me an opportunity to get away for a couple days and I had the privilege of taking my youngest son Jonathan on a backpacking trip so since Monday till this early this morning we were in Manistee National Forest backpacking it amen so if you see me get up and down kind of slow you'll know why I'm Just a Touch sore I've had the privilege of taking each of my sons when they returned about 14 15 on a camping trip just them and I and it's been glorious it's been a wonderful time that we spend just two of us each time but the first time I did it was nine years going those Hills get steeper and my pack gets heavier and so I don't know if I'll be taking my grandchildren or not we'll just see how that goes but we had a wonderful time a little bit sure good to us and and so everything just worked out great the weather looked like it was going to be bad and it turned out to be wonderful it was beautiful so God was good to us but we noticed it got Smokey hazy up there starting yesterday like it's been today and I understand that it's all from wildfires up in Canada I don't know a whole lot about it but I've heard and I thought my this world is under judgment it's reeling under the judgments of God that began when a prophet threw a rock in the air and the earthquake struck Alaska and we're seeing the signs of The Sixth Seal in effect all around us and this is nothing compared to what will happen when the vials pour out under the tribulation period and it's not going to get better but it's going to get worse but I thank God he's already prepared us and he's told us and he's given us a word that'll take us out of here before the full power of that 60 on leashes in the tribulation period so we have to deal with some of these things just like in the judgments that fell upon Egypt you know the first part of the judgments also affected the children of Israel but then there came a time that there was a separation and for us there'll come a time we get the ultimate separation we get a translation and a wedding supper and we have our separation completely from this world amen we thank God God's sure been good to us we're thankful to have brother Noel I really appreciate brother Nolan sister Shirley and the sacrifices that they make their dedication to the ministry that God's given brother Noah and also all the work and the help that they do they're very instrumental helpful with their home Church they help with the missionary Camp they help at byc they travel to India many many times and I'm so thankful for people that are faithful and just willing to be a help anywhere they can be a help and consistent I mean I don't know how many years they've been going to byc to work in the kitchen but how many sister Shirley over 20 years I said God bless them amen and thank you all for your service so they just help wherever that they can help amen and I love that I appreciate that this is your hands

sleeping Saints will wake and join us for translation in this hour the Gentiles days soon will be over Glory Hallelujah to our God the original life if we could comprehend that it changed your whole attitude your whole focus on life okay that's all I'm not a singer so I have to call you let you guys rest but I wanted that because that's the message in reality that is the message we're called unto adoption we are called to a changing of our bodies we are called where we will no longer dwell in these temples of flesh but there will be change in the moment and the twinkling of an eye and we will have no more sickness we'll have no more pain we'll have no more Satan we'll have no more troubles we'll have no more problems that is what's coming that is what's coming and it's here but we have to believe that well I'll do that at the end okay um well you're standing I don't like to keep everybody standing um turn over to Hebrews the 10th chapter and read verses 5 through 10. the subject matter is the bride coming of Christ this is something that I've been studying for the last couple three months really I ministered India every other week on an average and this has been the focus I've been trying to teach them and really it's very simple but it takes a revelation from God to understand the simplicity of what God was trying to tell us through the prophet Hebrews chapter 10 starting at verse 5 it says wherefore when he cameth into the world he say his sacrifice and offering thou what is not but a body hast thou prepared me and burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou Hast no pleasure then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it's written of me to do thy will oh God and let's pray Heavenly Father it is our privilege to gather ourselves together and sing songs of worship and praise and adoration unto you and to realize Lord who you are and what we are in you because Lord you called us you have chosen us you have elected us for the hour in which we are now living that Lord you might fully express your life through us so take me Lord as your servant this evening move me aside I got many thoughts going through my head so Lord you have to organize them and take it and present it in the way that will be understandable to the people Bless the people I pray through your word for I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated just a little update my wife and I went to India this year we left the middle of January we got back into February um I did not want to go I'll be honest and but the Lord opened the door the Lord provided the means the Lord God serves us he managed to supply all the funds and then some and so I felt obligated if you will to obey what I felt the leading of God was so he went over to India and we managed to have traveled around I ministered about every other night when it comes out the average comes down to we did a lot of traveling we went uh we stayed around a Hyderabad area then we went up into the forest area which is up north above well it wouldn't make any difference but anyway and then from there we went over to the east coast we traveled down the East Coast we ministered a bunch of churches that are that we have established one of the things I felt impressed on about three four years ago is we have to take the message and get into their language so I talked with Freddie gray the brother I work with and by my prodding I'll put it that way we managed to have over 350 messages now in the Telugu language which is available to the people that speak that language through the Hub that the Cloverdale house and uh I have been I I prod them periodically to keep it going trying to be nice and uh I mean Shirley and I we went there for the first three weeks it was fine the last three weeks we were sick every day but I went because I felt led I know that where I went to places I I went I said we felt led to go I saw God answer prayer I saw how God moved I saw God working in different things and so I know it was God's will we went why we had to be sick half the time I don't know that's between God maybe we'll reveal that in eternities but I felt had to go so I went I mean there was one time just to let you know what it's like over there I ate something that severely disagreed with me then I got up and I started ministering and 15 minutes into it I had to leave so I could go outside and get rid of some things and then go back and for the next 20 or 30 minutes finish my sermon I was not going to let Satan win I was there I had a message on my heart say you're not going to stop me I'm going to do what I feel led so anyway that was our trip it was very difficult for us this year it really was but I felt led to go I accomplished what I felt God wanted me to accomplish and he brought us back safe and for that I was so grateful when we look at the at the message that the bride coming of Christ like I say I started studying this brother Branham and the rising of the sun he makes a statement as Christ was the first one to raise from the phrase from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church they'll have to be there will there will there'll be a chief waved again in the last days and we know that that was the message that was what God had done to us through the prophet but when we talk about the bride coming of Christ it means Christ is going to come and so live in the bride until he will live his life and he will manifest his life through us it's not about us it has nothing to do about us it's about us taking our bodies and yielding them to God so that God can do what God wants to accomplish it's like I say he needs vessels God is a Spirit in order for that Spirit to express itself he has to have a body to live in that's you that's us and but we have to learn to yield to that we have to learn to grasp hold of who we are and what we are brother Brown says we we as the bride we live below our you know below our privileges we have power and we have authority and we sit on it because we don't believe it we don't either believe the word or we don't believe it applies to us or we don't believe Who We Are but once we begin to grasp hold of who we are and what we are and the authority God has given to us and that we have we have the ability to command Satan and when we command Satan he has to obey us not because it's us because it's because as God himself speaking through us and if we can grasp hold of that like I said then all of a sudden our approach to things completely changes you know when we when uh when we read there in Matthew it talks about God has prepared a bride or prepared a body you know God has always prepared bodies we don't we it talks there about Jesus Christ that that is true but do you realize God prepared Moses Moses was a special person God had Moses born at a specific time for a specific purpose but Moses was going to do it on his own God says oh no no I have told Abraham what's going to happen when all of a sudden you deliver them out and you becoming the the Pharaoh and you releasing them without the Judgment coming upon that Nation no that is not what I had told Abraham when you leave Abraham I'm going to judge that Nation I'm going to spoil that Nation and so all of us said Moses had to be willing to submit to God and be able to have God speak to him and that's why the plagues and that's why all the other things came down we go and you look at the prophets you have to realize they when you look at that when you go through the history of Israel you have to begin to realize God chose them for the hour in which they lived because there was the spoke to they were going to speak to a specific group of people and God was going through that prophet he was going to deliver unto them a message and generally speaking the only time the graphite is necessary is when the people begin to drift away from the word of God they begin to do their own things and all of a sudden God has to bring a prophet in the line to bring everything back to the word bring everything back to their focus on God why did God send us a prophet get us back to the word what is he going to do be I will send me Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord what was the purpose of that get them back into the word get them back to the faith of the fathers that's why God sent the prophet and so we could we could by looking at the prophet we could understand who we are if you put it all in the prophet you've missed it you say oh that was wonderful God sent a prophet look at all the Miracles God did through him if that's all you see you've missed it because that has to now come down unto us because the god that lived in him also lives in you and the god that delivered in him that lives in you wants to express himself through you the same way he did through that prophet I'm not talking about having the visions and having some of the other Miracles that God had with him but what I'm saying is God Lives in You and if you can be able to grasp the fact that it's gone you know I was at I was raised to trinitarium the father-son Holy Ghost so when we talk about the Holy Ghost living in you that that's fine but that was always the third person of a trinity so I just reverted back no it's God because that's who he is the holy spirit is God so I have God living inside of me but I have to learn how to release him rather than having him all bottled up and and doing my own thing whatever it is all of us said I have to give him the Liberty to take my body and use it where he could express himself through me and so that's opening my heart up that's opening my mouth up and say Lord here I am speak through me it's not about me it's about him it's not what I can do for him it's all about what he what I allow him to do through me why do we go to India we've been there we went there for 15 years or more why do we go God let us what has been accomplished like I say right now there's over 325 or 50 messages in the Telugu language that that if nothing else that's something we managed to accomplish and all I did was Supply the money they had to do all the work but I had to prod them periodically okay but but I mean but it's not about me it's not about what I have done it's like one person he came through he was he came in from Canada and says oh look at these are the fruits of your ministry I says it's not my Ministry I don't have one no this is God this is God's work this is what God has accomplished I just happen to be the donkey that carried the carried the the you know the grain or whatever it was you know one of the things with just this way of testimony um I was talking with Freddie gray a couple days ago and about four years ago I guess there's been maybe five we had went out into a remote area and the people didn't have any food and so we went and bought some two bags of rice I don't know how many kilos they were but they were big bags we brought that to the to that Village and gave them food and then the minister we were working with left his wife married somebody else and we can't work with him anymore and so we figured well all the work that we've put into that is gone but then Freddie when he was up in a remote area all of a sudden somebody came and visited with him and he says he says you don't know who I am and Francis but do you remember that time that you took that rice and gave it to those people I said well yeah he said now there's two there's two different congregations forty con 40 in each congregation why do we bring the rice God directed because he had a reason for it to be directed he had a reason for it to be given okay it's not about us it's not what we do it's not we plan all of this stuff basically what we just go along as we we feel that and then just pray well Lord do do something good with it we know that Jeremiah that God had formed God had called him from the from before he was even born and we can read in the Bible and we can read about the prophets we can read about Moses and Jeremiah and all the rest of them and oh yeah they lived in their generation and God used them but you understand that God has raised you up for this purpose do you realize God has called you God has elected you specifically you to be able to accomplish something that he cannot accomplish without you you are to be the full expression of Jesus Christ in this generation and how are you going to do that yield to God when we look at Jesus Christ we understand that he had to come that he that Jesus Christ came different than the rest of us came God took and he created a seed in Mary and from that said that formed the body in which God would come and he would dwell in and when I was thinking about that you realize all of all of us here that when we have kids we can look at our kids well yeah I can see my attribute in this one or my wife's attribute in that one because they're part of us in Adam there was it was the only attribute that was in him was God in Jesus Christ he wasn't he didn't give it anything for Mary all he got was because God himself that was God's attributes living out that out that man when he was born he was the son of God when you were born you were Sons and Daughters of God God ordained you to be who you are and what you are but Jesus Christ he had to overcome his flesh Adam had to overcome his flesh and he failed Jesus Christ had to overcome his flesh and because he did he was sinless because he never doubted he was always obedient to God because it says what in Isaiah 9 and 6 it says For unto us a child is born unto us the son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace when he was born that's who he was but do you realize who you are you are Sons and Daughters of God you are attributes of God that has come into full manifestation in Hebrews one and two it says hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom he made the world he made the world when he was in the logos form in the form of the logos that's when he began to speak and everything he spoke it came into manifestation brother Bradham said he had to believe his own word for that word to come into manifestation if he had to believe his word and if we can come to the place we can believe our word if it's anointed by God then that word also becomes creative and that word will create whatever it's sent out to create but we have to believe that and it goes on in Hebrews two and three he says through the brightness of being the brightness of his glory and the express image the exact exact in every aspect being the express image of this person and upholding All Things by his power and when he had prayed when he had when he by himself sat down and purged our sins so he had to ex he had to succeed where Adam himself had failed Jesus Christ God had to take God took on Humanity in Jesus Christ amen amen God did could not understand us until he came in Jesus Christ he he manifested himself through the prophets that is true but until he came in a bodily form and he became flesh like we are he could never understand the things which we go through he could never understand Temptations He could never understand pain he could never understand hunger he could never understand all the things which we experience because the Bible says he was tempted at all points just like we are but yet he never yielded to you never yielded to those Temptations he had in he in order for him to redeem us he had to become our Kinsmen Redeemer that's why God had to be had to come flesh in Jesus Christ he also you know he had to suffer the things he suffered so he could become our high priest I mean if an angel was standing right here how many of you would go up to him and say hey I gotta I got a headache or I got I'm not feeling good could you uh I wouldn't I'd be scared to even approach the man or the being or whatever but I can go to Jesus Christ because I know he understands me he understands who I am he understands my problems he understands my frustrations and so I have no problems going to him and because and and because of that I I lay out my life before him I lay out all my petitions before him but it goes on in Hebrews it goes on also in starting in chapter five starting at six and as he saith also in another place thou art a priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was hurt and that he feared though he were his son yet learned he obedience by the things that he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation and all them that believe he feared he knew the cross awaited him he did not want to go there he prayed father if there's any other way let this cup pass in The Gardener of Gethsemane is when he fully surrendered to the will of God because once he had fully surrendered to the will of God then from that point on then then then events would just continue to unfold but he feared that I mean he knew he I mean he knew the scriptures he knew he was going to third day he was going to raise up and you know he knew what was waiting him but yet the process of death was something he had never experienced God didn't God could not experience death because he's God and so this was something which was totally different which would be totally foreign to him he had to be born of the seed of David in order to be able to sit on the throne of David during the time during the Millennium he also had to become the seed of the woman that God had promised Adam in the Garden of Eden depending upon when you go and you read through the scriptures depending upon what you read depends upon how you perceive God to be the Jewish Nation when they looked at God God was a god of wrath and he was a god of judgment they couldn't look Beyond and we also realized he was the god of mercy and Grace and love because the law was there and the law was very judged very judged one guy was down he he wanted to cook his meal happened to be the Sabbath day he went out Gathering a few sticks so he could light them on fire so he could cook his meal because he broke the laws of the Sabbath he was taken out and stoned he wasn't hurting anybody he just wanted to have a hot meal but he broke one of The Commandments of God that cost him his life the law is very severe I mean how many times do we break the law how many times do we do things which we know is displacing to God but yet God gives us grace and mercy and brother Branham he relates that why because we are the wife of Jesus Christ God cannot judge us because he because because he would be judging he would be judging himself and so that be because of who he is and because of who we are in relationship to him that keeps the Judgment off of us until all of a sudden we come to confining reach what God had intended for us to be Jesus Christ was given a commission in his life he talks about that in Luke the fourth chapter so there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set a liberty them that are bruised and preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he sat down and said this day this scripture is fulfilled and John later on when John was in prison and he saw Jesus was they were expecting the king if you go back and you look at the prophecies concerning the birth of John the Baptist they were expecting him to be the Forerunner they were expecting Christ to come they were expecting God to come and set up his kingdom upon the face of the Earth and he was going to rule the world from Jerusalem they were looking for a king not somebody not somebody nice and gentle and meek and Mild going around Healing The Sick and raising the dead and doing good deeds and so John sent his disciples he says are you who are you the Messiah or should we be looking for someone else so Jesus performs a miracle he healed the sick he he cast out demons he did this and he did that and he says now you go and show John what you've seen because what he was doing he says tell John because I am fulfilling what my commission is I am doing what God has sent me here to to do and to fulfill do you understand that is our commission what God we are the continuation of Jesus Christ we are his body literally on the face of this Earth so what are we supposed to be doing we are supposed to be going around and and preaching the gospel of the poor we're supposed to be out um priests delivering so the captives recovering of sight to the blind several Liberty them that are bruised we're supposed to go around and heal the sick and raise the Dead because that was that was what that was the commission of Jesus Christ well that is our commission you go through the book of Acts what did they do they carried on the commission of Jesus Christ well what is it supposed what did Brother Branham do he carried on the commission of Jesus Christ with brother Branham it was never anything about him in one place he says not about me he says I'm just standing there when he does it all of a sudden when somebody comes in their prayer line all of a sudden brother Branham gives his body over to God and God begins to speak through him and begins to reveal the secrets of the heart that wasn't brother he would have no way of knowing that no that was gone but see now it comes down into us we don't have that discernment but I've met a couple of ministers which do I mean there was one guy um he called up and was talking to the minister and kind of telling you know reading him the riot act so to speak and all of a sudden God gave him a vision he says you're sitting in front of your computer and you're looking at pornography where you're looking at pornography and you've done this and this against your wife about that time the other guy hung up God revealed to that brother what the other brother was doing because discernment is still there it's still within the body of Jesus Christ I know when I was preaching there in India this time all of a sudden I got on a subject I had didn't even have it in my notes and I covered the subject and went on and and and brother Freddie told me afterwards he says you may not realize it but there were some people that were believing this false Doctrine and you hid it well okay I didn't know I was ignorant but yet God God saw fit to do it that way Jesus Christ took 12 men and had them follow him wherever he went he wanted them to follow him so that they could see Miracles being performed so they could see their demons being cast out so they could see the dead being raised up so that they could begin to realize the power that God that the power that Jesus Christ possessed but then he goes on he says I'm giving you the authority to do the same thing you see it in me he sent him out two by two in the surrounding communities where they went out all of a sudden they came back with it with the praise report oh yeah we prayed for this and all of a sudden he walked we prayed for this person they rose from the dead we prayed for this person we prayed for that person and they could repeat all the Miracles they had the authority by Jesus Christ he gave them that Authority amen we have the same Authority but do we are we willing to exercise that Authority I mean everybody you know if somebody is sick they call for the pastor why don't you pray the same God dwells in you dwells in him I'm not you know trying to say we don't need a pastor don't get me wrong on that but what I'm saying is the same God that dwells in him dwells in you so what is why don't you think your prayers have any value do you think you have to get somebody super spiritual and you think so highly of him and you think he's he's an angel sent from God down here that's sinless no he's like he's a human being just like you are he has he has well he has frozen I have faults and failures I'll leave him alone but we have to begin to understand who Who We Are we have to begin to have faith in what God has told us we can do I mean there there have been there there have been times and I'm well one example just there was a couple of months ago anyway my wife was coughing well it was late I was tired I wanted to go to bed get some sleep because her coughing was keeping me awake she went into the front room she laid down in the easy chair she was trying she was trying to get some sleep too and finally I I got mad so I went into where she was laying down I said Satan I am tired of you keeping me awake I am tired of you harassing my wife you have no business in this house get out I wasn't even nice to him you know what she stopped coughing I got some sleep and she got some sleep but it's that simple it is that simple it's like we were we were we were at a meeting recently this brother showed me his hand and he had it had been crushed slightly and he had lost he had lost feeling in two of his fingers and uh so I looked at it and says do you believe God can heal and he kind of looked at me and so I just put my hand on his and I said Lord the name of Jesus Christ restore their feeling he looked at me and I says I believe that when I pray God hears and I believe in God and I believe God hears I believe God answers my prayer not because I am anything but I am I am a vessel that I'm trying to yield myself to God so that God through me can express himself to others it has nothing to do with me I am not super spiritual I am not super righteous in fact one of the examples that that when we were in India a number of years ago and and I like to be punctual anyway I was with brothers and they like they after we had a meeting a service they sat down to eat and I looked at my watch every I knew how long it's to go to the next meeting so about an hour and a half two hours later we left and the sun was setting in the village we were coming to and I was fit to be tied okay and all of a sudden we get there and as we're going into the village all of a sudden this guy stands up and waves at us emergency pray emergency pray and I figured great now what so they would walk me down this pathway you know I mean it did to a shack I mean they don't have nice houses and he's not out in The Villages anyway went in there and there was this young lady probably mid-20s it'd be my guess her husband had died a couple of her kids had died and so preacher zelder you have an evil Wicked Spirit in order for that Spirit to go you have to fast 40 days and 40 nights and she did but they she didn't have the mass she didn't have the nutrients and within her body to sustain her and so after a while I don't know how long it had been but they had taken her the hospital the hospital says we can't do anything all of her organs are shutting down take her home and you know put her in the casket and bury her so I went in and I looked at the situation and I said I said Lord don't look at the stupidity of the ACT but look at the sincerity of her heart and give her her life back and God honored that I was in a very I was upset I was mad but yet even in spite of that God managed to get through me to minister to her you don't have to be in the best of moods you just have to learn how to yield to God you have to learn to release the god that is within you without the authority Jesus Christ had given them they could have done nothing without that Authority we can do nothing but if you realize you have that Authority you have the authority to pray for the sick and to raise the dead and cast out demons freely he said you've received it freely give it out but you have to believe that you have to believe that God is in you you have to believe that God will hear and answer your prayer it goes on and just before the just before Christ's crucifixion he goes he makes a prayer he says neither I pray for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word that they may be one as thou father art in me and I indeed that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them thou in me that they me may be perfect in one he had told them you need to be you there needs to be a Unity a Oneness not necessarily amongst themselves but there has to be a unity and a Oneness with God as Jesus Christ and God is because God dwelt in Jesus Christ that's what made him and the him and him and the father won well when you receive the Holy Spirit what did you receive you received God well if you received God that means God dwells in you well this is what Jesus Christ was saying that I will be in them and they will be in me and we all together will be in being be in the father and this didn't happen to them actually until the day after today a Pentecost and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit came upon them in the upper room and if you notice their life from that point on it changed they were debating who is going to be the great one they weren't going to be debating who is going to sit on the right hand and who's going to sit on the left hand no they realize now they had a commission and now God was living in them and God was guiding and directing their lives they came just as Jesus Christ was ascending they said are you gonna when are you going to restore the kingdom to Israel Jesus says it it's not for you to know the times of the seasons um which the father put into his own power but you will receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and then you'll be Witnesses Jesus Christ could not begin his ministry until the River Jordan when God came down and dwelt in that body in its fullness that's when Jesus Christ became the fullness of the godhead bodily when you receive the Holy Spirit what have you received God now of living in you if God is now living in you it's the same thing as what God did in Jesus Christ same thing as when God did and brother Brad I'm saying thing that God did in Paul say anything that God has done all through in everybody within the church because now the church is the literal body of Jesus Christ you know I studied you know what is the function of a church God took a numerian place to seed Mary was the carrier of that seed she had to nurture that seed until that seed could come to maturity and be born through seven Church ages what has happened that seed was planted on the day of Pentecost it had to go and it had to die but then all of a sudden in Luther all of a sudden there's that surgery that seed began to germinate and what was what was the what was the purpose of the function of what was the purpose of the functional during this time to take that seed to take the life of God itself and to nurture it and to carry it all the way through those Church ages until finally we come into this church age and what is in this church age that seed has to come to maturity the seed has to come into full manifestation the full expression that could not happen until this age that's why we're talking about the bride coming of Jesus Christ that's why we're talking about God coming to full manifestation expression in the bride because we that seed has to come to full expression in you but you have to believe that it says in what in second Corinthians therefore If any man be in Christ he's a new creation all things are passed away and everything has become new in Philippians 2 and 5 it makes a statement it says Paul writing he says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought a not robbery to be equal with God but he made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross we look at that at Jesus Christ and we know that that is true have you ever began to try to apply that to you let this mind be in you which was also in Christ so being in the form of God you are an attribute of God isn't that a form you are an attribute of God yes okay so where does God live he lives inside of you and so Jesus said he did not think it robbery to reclaim equality with God for us to claim equality with God's a big step but the equality with God doesn't make us proud it doesn't make us puffed up it doesn't make us think we're all powerful and we can go and do our own thing because the only way the only way that the only way that the power of God works through us is if God anoints that anoints the word of us and he and he begins to anoint our body and he begins to guide and direct us to the things which we say the brother Branham could have gone out any day and when he goes squirrel hunting he could have gone out and you know it wasn't it was not within him to speak squirrels until God gave him the unction what are you out here for get some squirrels well how many do you need well I need three well so he spoke one came and the angel says I said I thought you said three well so then he spoke the next one and finally he spoke the Third but that was under the unction and the anointing of God himself God directed we cannot go out and just speak unless it's under the unction of the direction of God but there are times when actually that happens within our lives we happen to be down in Jamaica one year and there was a there was a hurricane which was coming and approaching it it was going to go right over the top of us and we just we began to pray not only me but some other ones he says well Lord we want you to direct the path instead of going this way we want to have it do this way and that's exactly what it did because we commanded it for lack of a better way of putting it I know I was with my brother and we were in Arkansas there was a tornado coming and he was going right where we were at I said Lord that thing has to go around us it splitted into two went around us joined back together again and continued going why did God honor that I don't know I'm thankful he did because tornadoes I'll pick you up and send you where you don't want to go but that power lies in you but you have to believe that you have to believe that whatever you say if it's under the unction and the anointing of God God will perform exactly what came out of your mouth now it's like we've been cautioning some people um be careful what what you say with your mouth because you might get something you're not anticipating you know there was well where there was one sister oh I want to experience ever everything every any everything possible that you can experience as a woman in childbirth I said lady you don't know what you opened up your mouth and said I haven't had any babies my wife has had plenty yeah okay so now all of a sudden when she has morning sickness and she has this pain and she has that pain I figured you asked for it lady you know I mean we still pray try and be nice but um anyway but like one one guy he was saying he says well Lord he says why am I having all these problems God says you asked for it what do you mean I asked for it well didn't you pray Lord whatever it takes you asked for it okay believe that alone but see if we could begin to understand what what dwells in US we are in the for we are an attribute of God expressed we were in the mind of God in the beginning in the process of time we came into manifestation well so because we are an attribute of God because we are Sons and Daughters we are coming to adoption adoption is what we say is the same as God himself speaking that is where this generation is come this we are predestinated to adoption we are predestinated to come into that manifestation but do you believe that because if you believe that you would begin to act that way you would begin you would begin to to function in your mind and begin to begin to go through the scriptures and begin to realize what is God where does he dwell how does he live in me how am I going to express him how am I going to do this and but and the closer you get to him the more you realize that you're nothing that all you are is the vessel he wants to use you have to die so he can live his life through you in fact the only life that says you know we we're supposed to live lives as Christians the only life that God honors and respects is his own because there's no way I mean we make mistakes every day we make mistakes sometimes just before we even get out of bed but if we begin to understand well Lord I'm here at your service today use me however you see fit and then all of a sudden I mean we get up and I have I make a list of things I want to accomplish all of a sudden something will come up we'll throw away that list now we'll learn you obviously had something else planned for today so lead me where you want me to go but there has to be a willingness to yield instead of a stubbornness no I'm going to do this today because I've got to get this done well you may have just missed God it says and but Jesus Christ um when he was put in the form of a man in every aspect he was a servant he served others we are to serve others it's not about us gaining ourselves it's not about us using the power for ourselves it's not about us gaining things no it's about us learning how to serve and meet the needs of other people because I mean that's what Jesus Christ did well if somebody has a need and you have the ability to fulfill it you should be doing that I mean why do we go to India because there's needs over there and so we take what we can and we try to supply what we can to them as much as God will give me to give to them I mean um but this is where we all have to be we have to learn to be servants and then being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient even to die on a cross there are times that God asks us to do things that to us make no sense are you willing to submit are you willing to go where he would guide and direct you to go regardless of the circumstances like I say I didn't want to go to India this this year God directed and like I say it was very difficult here for us but I went because I felt God you directed you supplied the needs you opened the door I have no choice but to follow I didn't know what was waiting for me when we got there I'm glad he didn't tell me ahead of time I for sure wouldn't have gone but I mean but here again we're servants to other people we go we minister to I mean when when we go into India there's places and and I have to speak through a translator and then I look at the people that are out there and a lot of those people are borderline literate and I figure how much of the message do they understand or comprehend and because I I was wondering what why am I putting forth the effort why am I going and doing the things that I'm doing and and they don't have to understand the message they have to understand who they are in Jesus Christ because if they can understand who they are in Jesus Christ that is the message they don't have to understand the mystery of the Seven Seals and all the other types of things all they have to do is realize that God has called them God has chosen them and they are trying with everything that they can to live a life that they believe is pleasing unto God in the padma's vision brother Bradham makes some statements he says this morning was more of the sermon type placing the foundation upon the deity of the revelation God being revealed in Christ oh how many believes it God was revealed in Christ Jehovah revealed in Christ now where is God to be revealed in his church with his people in US so the same way that God lived and expressed himself in the body we call Jesus Christ in the same way he wants to express himself through you he wants to manifest the same healing the same Miracles the same manifestations but also when you get into it he also he gets into he says the same Spirit the same works the same manifestation the Same Love the same forgiveness the same long-suffering gentleness patience peace Mercy all that all that all that was in Christ is now in the church it's the character it's the character you you met you the way you live and the way you act manifest what you are if Christ is in you you will you will those attributes of God will be made manifest there are some days I don't succeed and everybody reminds me I didn't succeed but yet there's something inside of me that is changing me from what I was to what I am I am not what I used to be last year I'm different than what I was and if God tarries I'll be different next year because there's something inside of me that is beginning to change me and to mold me not it's not me trying to conform Conformity he doesn't doesn't do any good because you're still you no but it's something inside of you where your very nature is being changed into the very nature of God himself and when the nature of God himself comes a full manifestation expression in you then people will go and they begin to look at you and know why are you so different you know it's like when we go and we you go grocery shopping I don't like the spirits of most of the people that I meet and then okay but brother Branham says we can create our own world and go live on it well I've asked to go to Mars although there's air is not real good there Venus is too hot Jupiter is too cold well Lord I mean what else can I do you know um so what I try to do is I create my own world a world I live in and so in that world that I live in there's gentleness there's patience there's meekness there's kindness and so wherever I go I we like we go to the grocery store and with one lady they're always supposed to say how are you doing and depending on how they act well I know what kind of day they're having you know but I ask well how are you doing oh um I'm all right isn't it a beautiful day outside well yeah isn't it great to be alive well um yeah you know and so you begin to change there I'm inviting them into my world I'm inviting them to experience what I live in because what the world are what our world is doing now I want nothing to do with it but yet I want to take I want to present I want to take my world and I want to create my world such that such that all the attributes of Jesus Christ is now living within this world and then wherever I go I want them to see that world I want them to experience as much as they can because you know you're the only God they'll still see people are looking for sincerity their people are looking for truth well we're the only ones that have it so unless you present it to them they'll never they'll never see it in Christ The Mystery of God revealed or if God can get him prisoners like that speaking of Paul now that's when he can express the pre-evidence you see he's got the man or the person's so that he knows nothing but Christ you get what I mean he said first to express himself completely that was God in Christ second to have the preeminence by this in his church which is his body the bride until he that being God can have the preeminence to express himself through them it's God coming in you it's God expressing himself through you it's God taking possession of your body and using your body where he can begin to reach out and speak unto other people you know when you when you go and you begin to look in the book of Acts you know Paul was a mighty man of God he was led by the spirit and uh but when you begin to look at Paul's life you realize Paul was still Paul he still had a temper he still had his opinions he still had his likes and his dislikes but yet he had to take and surrender all of that to God he said I have to Die daily so that God can express himself through me brother Branham was a man he had things he liked he had things he didn't like he hated cats I know he mentioned that more than once but but what I'm trying to say is in his Humanity he was a human being but yet look what God was able to do through him because all of a sudden when God had need of him like brother Brandon made mention one place they were up they were driving up to the Alaskan Highway and they stopped in to get something to eat and there they were there and they had ordered some food I think it was and all of a sudden another car pulled up and brother Bradham realized that was the guy in the meeting that was in the army or Air Force and he was trying to commit suicide and all of a sudden the the what I heard from the other ministers is all of a sudden the whole expression of the Branham changed and he went over to that man and he ministered to his need it wasn't brother Branham doing it was God doing through him and see this is where we come we all of us that we come to we come across other people and they have needs I mean it's like we were this lady she brought she brought some stuff to my wife for alterations and she had a severe headache and we're part of an old folks choir okay we're old enough to be part of it and anyway so this lady had brought my wife some alterations and my wife looked at her and says you're not feeling good I said well I got a headache so surely just reached out and put her hands on her and prayed okay and the lady said instantly he was gone instantly and that was a witness to this old folks choir when Noel and Shirley come and they pray man God hears God will answer you know so that's the witness that we have to them but now we have to live lives making it so that they will they can look past our humanity and realize okay that it's God doing something through but we there to minister I mean we didn't put in prayer requests at our church and read it call it the pastor no I mean God lives in us why not use why not release him okay and the lady I see in church age brother about it makes the statement it says as he stands here revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of God Jesus Christ in this age is the author of the creation of God okay this is another creation this has to do with the church special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride what was he doing he was creating God in us says it goes on down here he says what was Jesus Christ he was the god man he was the son of God he was of the new creation man and God met and joined he was the first of a new race and he was the head of that race he said there you can see through Matt though man was of the old order of creation Now in Union with Christ he because he became a new a new creation of God his new creation is not the old creation made over it could not be called a new creation this is exactly what he says it's a new creation it's another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by the ways of Flesh that is how he dealt with Israel he chose Abraham and Abraham's issue Through The Godly line Isaac line but now out of every Kindred tribe and Nation he has purposed a new creation he was the first of that creation he was God created in the form of man Now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation God is creating himself in you where you literally become a full manifestation and expression of God himself I mean that's that's that's hard and hard to grasp and understand but how is this possible because he plays within you a seed that seed can only produce the life that is in it the life of the seed that was in you was God what can it produce it can only produce God now that seed has to come to full manifestation has to come to full maturity and so what is it trying to do now that seed that was placed in you is trying to come into full manifestation expression where you yourself will be the full expression of God himself just like God came in Jesus Christ now God is coming in you because God wants to express himself through you but you have to yield to him it isn't what's it isn't you trying to do something for God it's you dying out to yourself so God can live his life through you so all of a sudden now God has a vessel so that so that he he can do what he's wanting to do through you I mean you you look at what I'm part of the fire department I volunteer um we go to the biggest problem we have is is the drug overdoses and when you go into a house and you see these guys which have been which have that Spirit on them that Spirit controls that body I mean he has no he has no control of himself that Spirit literally controls that body and so we give him Narcan try and bring him around and and sometimes we're successful sometimes we're not but it's interesting to look and to look at the household and look at the the way they're living and all the other that that demon is so has so possessed them where really they have no control over any aspect of their life well flip that over to the other side if we will take and allow God to have total possession of us then then then he can do through us the same thing he did through brother Branham or Jesus Christ or Paul or Peter or any of the rest of them if it's us yielding to him it's us allowing him to have total preeminence and control in our lives and that's where we have to come because we're the Bride of this age we're this is this is what we're predestinated to we are predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son we will be exact image exact replica of him but also remember Paul was still Paul brother Brandon was still brother Branham okay they still lived in temples of clay they still had them I mean there was there was still a lot of them around there's a lot of me around I know that and the more I eat the more of me there is but we have to begin on never mind but the more the more I can yield to God the more he can use me is whenever I decide I'm going to do you know if I say I'm going to do something for God he's saying I don't want you to I want you to yield to me so I can do something through you in perfect faith brother Banner makes a statement he said they had the word and the Word was flesh then that was in Jesus Christ and the word told them I give you power I power amen I give you power and they have the power but they didn't have the faith to operate the word that was in them the word that Jesus Christ had given to them the authority that God Jesus Christ had given to them yeah they had the authority but they did not have the they did not have the faith to believe in that Authority which was just given unto them and going on in that says he had Faith talking about Jesus Christ he had he had Faith with his power how did he he said I can do nothing but in myself why he relied upon what he was he relied in knowing that he was the word and that he had the faith in The God Who had made him the word and so and so now that is what God is trying to do in us do you do you under you claim to be the bride you claim to be the wife of God you claim to be an attribute of the father he claimed to have been a part of him from the beginning you claim that God has taken and has placed his seed in you at the time of your birth and that seed is what God has watched over all the way through your life bring it to the place where it is now but that seed has to come into manifestation the seed has to come to full expression but it can only do that as the when a seed in order for it to germinate the shell around it has to die for the life inside can be manifested well the shell has to die die to itself so the life that is inside can come into full manifestation come into full expression okay brother Branham in one place that says you have to have to will to do the will of God amen you have to make a conscious effort that you are going to do as God directs you to do in your life and so whenever God comes and he directs you to do something you have to be willing to submit to that directive brother Branham goes on he says talking about God coming in manifestation to us he said this is the true revelation of God this was his purpose this purpose took the form through election which means God chose that is why he could look right down in the last stage when he would all he could see all over himself still in the midst of the church as the author of this new creation of God his Sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the memories of this new creation he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will and by his omniscience and his omnipotence he brought it to pass it's not about you it's not about what you do it's about you learning to yield to the god that is in you it's about you committing your lives to Jesus Christ it's about Jesus Christ becoming the very Central focus of your life where everything else and everything else in life is secondary to Jesus Christ this is where the bride has to come brother random in in the rising of the son he says in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the do not out of the church there'll be there'll have to be a Sheaf waved over again in the last days waving of the Sheaf what was deceive the first one that come to maturity the first one that proved it was wheat that proved it was it was a sheep Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waived over the people and the first time they will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has been turned back again in his full power having been waived over the people because I live you live also speaking of speaking to his wife because I live you live also in what direction that was and what erection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Jesus Christ by God's quickening power amen why did God send the prophet so I could see what I am so I could see that what power lies in me and if I can yield to the spirit of God that is in me that same God that's in me can express himself through me the same way it did in the prophet and the same in you it's not about you and who you are and what you're what you're wanting to do you know we've attended a lot of graduations before it's a wrong time of year to speak this probably but you know all of the the ones that get into high school and they're going to graduate and they got all these plans made to go to college and become a great person this that or the other and then all of a sudden it's like my one of my uh nephews he was a football player and he was doing well in college until all of a sudden he was on a motor scooter and he got hit with a car and that laid him up for a year over a year he had to fight within himself to gain his strength back and then he was finally getting to the place that they wanted to actually put him back on the football field as soon as he did that all of a sudden in practice all of a sudden he twisted or pulled a muscle or something like that and that sent him right back to the hospital all of his plans where did they go nowhere my brother when he was going to retire he was going to still work in computers and and ham radio stuff and all of a sudden he had a heart attack um that heart attack changed his life all of a sudden he didn't have the stamina he couldn't he could not go and he could not continue to design and work on the problems that he had in designing different electronic stuff so then he got into the word he established a close relationship with God and now he preaches at Tucson Tabernacle at least every other week and now he I mean he preaches the message all of a sudden now he has a revelation of who God is he has a revelation of who he is he has a revelation and brother Branham was a prophet he had his Revelation what God was trying to tell us through that prophet and he's preaching this message if it hadn't been for the heart attack he would have still been working in computers but because of that now he's working in the ministry now he's working developing messages now he's trying to preach and encourage the people so that that heart attack it changed his whole life in fact one after he'd had the heart attack he didn't have any energy he would he would the church would have and they would he you know they he would sing the first song and he'd have to sit down and he didn't have any energy and that went on for I don't know a couple weeks months whatever it was and all of a sudden God spoke to his heart he says stand up and give me praise so he did he got up and he lifted his arms into God and he began to worship and praise God he saw the heart doctor about a week later and the doctor looked at him and says what's happened to you he says your heart's like a 20 year old but he had to be willing to obey the voice he had to be willing to submit himself to what God was telling him to do it changed his whole life well other things that goes on in my life it's changed my whole life the things that gone on in my wife's and our families and then things have changed theirs but here again is being willing to submit to the god that dwells in us because he knows what he wants done with us restoration of the bright tree see like he says like husband and wife is one person you and I are going to be one at that day that's this day yes you'll know that I am in the Father the fathers and made you I and you and you and me oh I love that and Satan gets so angry at that see the Oneness of God Oneness of God you know what he's placing us in he's making us part of the godhead he's making us so we are the expression of God himself he's elevating us to the place of where where we are in that realm of for lack of a better way we we become part of the deity this flesh no this flesh will never I cannot die for somebody else's sins I can that that that's different this that isn't what it's talking about here but it's talking about a one as a talking about a Unity with God it's talking about right where are we and God so become United together where we are literally one where I no longer do my will I do his will I no longer follow my thoughts I follow his thoughts I no longer follow my directors I follow his directives that's the unity that's the Oneness that he's talking about here but see once we fully yield ourselves to the spirit of God and in us it's no longer us but now it's God himself in us and God cannot be defeated so why do we are being defeated the weather balance is in one place he says when the bride realizes who what she is and what she stands for she'll do the Greater Works and Satan will be powerless before her okay so why are we why don't we have the power because we don't believe what we are we failed we failed to comprehend God sent the prophet to show me what I am to show me what I possess to show me the power that dwells inside of me when he shall appear we shall be like him for we'll see him as he is well okay I saw him I saw him in the prophet he that was the appearing to me of Jesus Christ I looked at brother Brown's life that's that's how God appeared into me and I look at that at that man I look at the image I look at how he lived his life I look at at how he dealt with other people I enjoy some of the older sermons because I as I go through those I glean this is how the Prophet this is what he whenever he went to the hotels he didn't want to get say in the you know five stars he went down to the where the common people when he was flying he didn't go business class no he went to the back of the plane with everybody else when he would he you know he could have driven Mercedes and mozzaratis in the whole nine yards would he drive he drove a Ford okay he did not want to be special he wanted to be like everybody else somebody was going to build him a house in a retirement community up in in Arizona in Tucson Arizona and brother Brown says I can't live there he says because they have somebody at the gate so somebody wants to come and see me I have to have called them I have to give them a written pass and permission for them to come and visit me he said I'm not going to live there I want to be open to the public I want them to be able to come freely to me I want them to be able to and he said why do I drive it Forward he says I'm if I was driving an air-conditioned Cadillac and all these the the people in the church what are they doing out there they're picking cotton and I'm driving in an air-conditioned Cadillac no no I want to be common I want to be like everybody else because I don't want to be different and because that was his attitude I mean shouldn't do that be kind of the way the rest of us are why do we why do we try to pretend to be something we're not anyway in John 17 neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe in Me through their word that they me that they all may be one as thou father are in me and I in thee that they also may be one in US and brother Brown goes on who do you say this is he says he said be one as I and the father one yeah be that kind of one then how will that be he said the word in us would be the anointed word that is the Oneness of God say the Oneness of God is the word anointed in you and then you become a sonary messiah of the age so if you take the message and you begin to feed on the message and you take that word and you store within your bit within your heart then when God has need of it it's there I know when that time my brother was in the Air Force and I fell down my heart to go and visit him and uh anyway I managed to read through the knit through the Old Testament up to the Psalms I think once and I read through the New Testament twice then I got an airplane I flew over to see my brother in in England and he had joined the Mormon church and so my brother says are you you're interested in learning about the Mormon church I said well curious yeah so they brought these two young elders early 20s elders and uh they they had their flip chart you know and they would bring up something and all of a sudden the word everything I had read in that last few months but doesn't the word also say this well yeah but uh and what about this scripture what about what Jesus said here what about well let's go on to the next point and after an hour I think an hour and a half and they'd only gone part of the way through their present day he says you need to go talk to somebody in San Francisco he can answer all your questions but that was an eye-opener to my brother well they are not they are not staying with the word and so my brother left that that was the whole reason why I went to take my brother to get him out of Mormonism and get him back into the word but I didn't know I was going to do that I just you know I I was I'd received the Holy Spirit earlier and I was anxious to read my Bible and get into the word and study and you know so I put enough up there where it you know God could find it brother Branham says see she was not talking about Mary she was not the seed Mary was not just the shuck the tassel and the star carriers of parts of the word not not all of the word and he goes on further down he says and he says but then come Pentecost the restoration of the gift of speaking in tongues they call it the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues there and they call that the initial the initial evidence which which they brought forth he said what was that he said that was to suck but they denominated but when you come to say I and my father are one and these other things then the shuck pulls away from it but the real January bride church will bring forth the entire word of God in its fullness and in its strength for he's the same yesterday today and forever so have you come to the place you can say I and my father are one have you come to the place in your relationship with God where all of a sudden you can say I have so I have I have I have so become Oneness with my father it's no longer I who live and now it's God himself living his life through me and I'm under the full obedience I'm under full subjection to my father and I go and I do as my father directs us as as God did in the body we call Jesus Christ that's the Oneness that's talking about I and my father are one but see this is where we're coming this is the Prophet this is why he's taught this is I mean this is the third poll this is us because this is literally becoming him and that's what we are predestined to become I I didn't I made a study on habakkuk about three four years ago and that changed my whole approach to My Life as a Christian habakkuk lived during the time when God was going to bring judgment upon his Nation and hybrid cook was afraid because he says when the Chaldeans come in he says what are they going to do based on men women children they don't care and habakkuk was living in that City would he survived what was coming he had no guarantee the Bibles in in habakkuk where it talks about you know the just shall live by faith it also talks about there and I'll have to paraphrase he says the man who the man who has confidence in himself God says fine I'll take my hands off let him do it but he says if you will put your faith in me I will take care of you and so I after I read that and have a good he got to the end and if you read it's only four chapters he goes to the end he says though there'll be nothing in the cell there will be there'll be total devastation yet I will worship my God as if I possessed everything what he had did not determine how he worshiped what he had or had not done not determined his relationship with God and so Isis will Lord take hold of my hand and from this point on you lead Wherever You Lead I'll follow and I've tried to be obedient to that because I don't know what tomorrow's going to bring I don't know what our government's going to do to us I don't even want to think about what they're going to do to us but all I know is I did my God has already been yes tomorrow he knows what my life will be like tomorrow he's already been there so if he has my hand and he's leading and guiding me through tomorrow he already knows what's coming and all they have to do is be obedient to follow and that is that's my concept am I perfect no do I make mistakes oh yeah do I have my faults and failures I got plenty but I'm not relying on me I'm relying on Calvary I'm relying upon what Jesus Christ did for me on that cross I am righteous because he said I am I am Holy because he said that I am I am saved because he said that I'm saved I am bride because he said I was bride that's the only thing I can rely on is what he told me I am en and I'm sorry and I'm willing to accept that and he swore by himself brother Manor makes this makes a statement he listen I'm going to say something look faith is unconscious amen you believe it I've learned that in the years of travel around the world and meeting the people of all different walks but faith is unconscious you got faith and you don't even know it that's right Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a storm and the Gale knocking the boats about from side to side or the other or he was standing in the face of a mess of demons if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he he walked right along just as calm and quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear of anything around him that's right whether it was going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knewed it was going to happen because God had said so and he said you're here to fulfill this too just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious of the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right hand to the left just keep moving on he said you'll have your ups and your Downs he says don't worry you got to go through those Briar patches over sharp rocks and over Bluffs and down the hillsides and up through the mountains over Waters but walk with God yes sir there's so many Hills to climb upward you heard that old song you're going to have troubles we're all going to have troubles but who are we trusting if you're trusting yourself good luck if you're trusting your bank account good luck you're trusting your 401k good luck if you're trusting the government to help you out good luck but if you're trusting in God he promised and if you can believe in him it is like to me Faith is not believing for something it's believing in someone I believe God's more than able I believe God will I believe he will honor his word I believe he will supply my needs I believe he will heal me when I ask him to heal me I believe that he will do all the things that this word has promised that he will do and why do I believe that because God sent a prophet into me in this generation and that Prophet showed me what Jesus Christ was and to have that Jesus Christ now wants to live his life through me it's not about me it's about him it's not about what I do it's about what he does it's not about all my faults and failures and all my my Hang-Ups no it's all about him and the more I can die unto myself and the more I can yield myself to him the more the more that I can be victorious in my Christian Life let's see we are called unto adoption full Authority and Power sleeping okay sleeping Saints will wake and join us for translation in this hour Gentile days soon will

awake and join us for translation in this house Gentiles day soon be over Glory Hallelujah to our god the original life the original life the original scene the original word is what I believe the son of man is revealed the seven sealed is unveiled the original life to the original scene amen aren't you glad amen God's told you who you are amen so many wonderful things God shared with us and reminded us of tonight one thing that I'm taking away from me personally is I want to yield completely there's a statement that brother Noel made early on that really impacted me he said God is a spirit in order for him to be expressed he has to have a body well I believe by faith he's called me to be part of that body I believe that he wants this body [Music] but God is also a gentleman you know my brother Venom told us the Holy Ghost is a gentleman he doesn't Force so what he needs is a yielded vessel a yielded body and I want to be yielded I said God help me to yield more God help me to surrender more God help me to forget my own ways my own Ambitions my own ideas and help me to take your way above everything else amen we must truly Die daily amen and that's becoming more of a theme in my life to Die daily and I didn't realize you know Brother Kyle made that statement I think he was quoting and I believe it was Dwight Moody but he may be wrong when he said the problem with the Living Sacrifice is it keeps crawling off the altar remember when he said that oh if that isn't the truth the problem with the Living Sacrifice is it keeps crawling off the Altar and I say God I don't want to keep crawling off the altar but I want to stay here yielded completely to you you know what I believe that the things our brother Noel preached is the the word for this day and I believe it's the thing that God wants to accomplish in this hour he wants to manifest himself in the formation of the Bride in Bride form he wants to manifest his life through her till she will so reflect him she will be him if that's what he calls for then this hour then it's possible it's here it's his desire and I want to be one of those yielded vessels that he can use amen thank God I thank God for the word I thank God for what he's doing in my heart and giving me that desire and when I hear the word preached like this I say that's what I want that's really what I want I may have failed in it today I made fail yesterday I may fail in it tomorrow but that's actually what I want it's the way I want to be and that's God drawing that life from us praise God amen God bless you it's good to be here remember to keep brother Noel in prayer and then they'll be heading to the camp here next week so pray for the camp as well hey man let's just go ahead and sing that song start from the beginning of

scene one more time the original life the original scene the original word son of man is revealed the seven seal is unveiled the original lie the original scene thank you [Music] not going to preach again in Hebrews the fourth chapter it makes a statement let us therefore fear as the promise of being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith and then that heard it God sent us a prophet to increase our faith to get us back to the faith of the fathers let us fear lest the promise being left us we reject it God bless you for a long time I travel down along Lonely Road my heart was so heavy and then I heard about Jesus us what a wonderful hour I'm so glad that I found out he could bring me out through this saving power say God I am free free from this world of sin I've been washed in the blood of Jesus I've been born again
