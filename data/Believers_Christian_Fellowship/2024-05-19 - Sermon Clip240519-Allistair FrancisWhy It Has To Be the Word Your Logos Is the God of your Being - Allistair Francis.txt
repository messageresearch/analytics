TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if you don't have the correct revelation of the spoken word you will manifest Christianity according to man's idea sec in Corinthians Paul says it's impossible for a man to understand the things of God if he has the spirit of man you cannot understand the things of God unless you have the spirit of God is that right that's where the Holy Ghost comes in I always use this uh this analogy I'm not sure if I mention it here but it's like it's like this you have man and you have a chimpanzee and they both look alike right somewhat a little bit more ha and he's not wearing clothes right but he has he can walk around he's got five fingers he's got five toes he's got a head he's got eyes facing forward his nose like ours his ears and you can put a suit on him you can put a tie on him you can teach him how to drink from a cup you can give as long as you keep giving him peanuts he'll do exactly what you what you want him to do you just keep giving him snacks and he's going to keep he will wear the suit for more peanuts yeah right right right y but does he know why he's wearing a suit the suit has no meaning to him he actually hates it he doesn't know how why should it can you imagine a chimpanzee lip on a cup how difficult that must be and and what's he going to do with a tie it's choking him to put his feet in a shoe he's not going to climb a tree yeah you're removing the meaning from him by trying to put human things on him right there's only one way you can get this chimpanzee to think like a human yes sir you have to become a chimpanzee you have to go down to his level you have to explain so what what happens if you become a chimpanzee and you walk in the tribe and say we need to build a house we can be better let's become civilized let's stop biting each other's faces off you know let's share the berries this is we can become better people we can become you have to become a chimpanzee it's funny but this is what God did for us that's right but the church wants peanuts right blessings I'll be a Christian as long as he heals me I'll be this as long as he blesses me but are you finding meaning or you just want peanuts but he became man he showed us how to be better he brought his the concept of God into flesh the word was made flesh for you and I he died for you and I and he could show us that we don't have to be this immoral human race we can be Godlike he brought that down to us I don't want peanuts I want his word I want the meaning praise be to God
