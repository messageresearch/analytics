[15:24] testimony that are not our hearts burned
[15:27] within us
[15:28] as he spoke to us along the way and
[15:30] opened to us the scriptures
[15:33] but when he appeared in the midst in the
[15:36] private setting with the disciples
[15:38] he did more than just open the
[15:40] scriptures he opened their understanding
[15:43] to understand
[15:45] oh God's been opening the scriptures but
[15:48] what we need is for him to open our
[15:49] understanding
[15:51] to understand the scriptures and when
[15:54] the Revelation hits now when the opening
[15:57] of the word when it opens our
[15:59] understanding to understand the open
[16:00] word now it hits and now I love the way
[16:04] the brother wrote that now I know that
[16:07] he desires it's not a mystery anymore
[16:09] why does he love me how does I know why
[16:11] amen I know the mystery I know why he
[16:14] seeks me I know why he loves me I know
[16:15] why I love him so much
[16:18] because of the mystery that's been

[18:42] back so remember them
[18:45] let's read here Revelations chapter 10
[18:47] verse 7 just one scripture
[18:50] but in the days of the voice of the
[18:52] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[18:54] sound the mystery of God should be
[18:57] finished as he hath declared to his
[18:59] servants the prophets man God bless you
[19:01] as you take your seeds
[19:05] and we're going to speak on this
[19:07] scripture here in just a minute but I
[19:08] just wanted to make a couple of
[19:10] announcements I want to remind you that
[19:12] we will not be having a Wednesday
[19:14] service this week there'll be no midweek
[19:16] service we'll be meeting over uh at the
[19:19] campground for The Retreat on Thursday
[19:21] evening for those who can gather on
[19:23] Thursday evening we'll have a service
[19:25] there at seven uh the email packet was
[19:28] sent out to everybody who's registered
[19:29] with all the information I encourage you
[19:31] to go back over it review it again
[19:33] because you don't want to leave anything
[19:34] out you don't want to miss anything and
[19:37] we are certainly looking forward to
[19:38] spending some time together amen what a
[19:40] privilege that God has granted us to be
[19:42] able to do something like this and I
[19:44] don't want to take that privilege for
[19:45] granted but if God's allowed us this
[19:47] opportunity I want to soak up everything
[19:48] I can out of it amen I'm going to give
[19:50] my all to it and I want to receive all
[19:52] that I can also wanted to remind you
[19:54] that
[19:56] the the real Vision behind the retreat I
[20:00] I we talked about it last year but I
[20:01] just want to bring it to your
[20:02] remembrance and I know we have some new
[20:04] that are among us and new that will be
[20:05] going but really it stemmed from a
[20:08] family vacation and I I so enjoyed
[20:11] having my family around and we had
[20:13] special devotions and some special
[20:15] devotions we did on the word and we were
[20:17] so edified we were so blessed physically
[20:19] and spiritually I I told my wife I said
[20:22] why can't the whole church go on a
[20:23] vacation
[20:24] together and that was really the
[20:26] inspiration when you know Jesus was take
[20:28] his disciples and they would draw aside
[20:31] he would draw them aside why because
[20:33] they were tired from service
[20:36] they hadn't even had time to eat so he
[20:38] drew them aside so that they could be
[20:40] refreshed and always when they would
[20:41] draw aside they would Fellowship on the
[20:43] word and so I just pray that we can all
[20:45] just stop the pace of life for a few
[20:48] days draw aside refresh ourselves
[20:50] physically and spiritually spend some
[20:53] time together and fellowship we
[20:55] intentionally try not to make the
[20:57] retreat packed with activity uh you know
[20:59] like Services two three times a day but
[21:02] so we can have time just to slow down
[21:03] and fellowship with one another share
[21:06] meals together amen we encourage we
[21:08] always encourage everybody to to you
[21:11] know we're going to eat so many meals
[21:12] together in this big dining room
[21:14] together try to find a new group to sit
[21:17] with every time somebody you've never
[21:18] fellowshipped with sit down it's a
[21:20] perfect opportunity to get to know him
[21:22] and so it would be great to meet some of
[21:25] those who have joined the assembly
[21:26] within the last year
[21:28] like brother Blake said Derek and
[21:30] Pharaoh brother Derek sister pharah will
[21:32] be there I believe they're supposed to
[21:33] arrive Friday sometime so we'll get to
[21:35] meet them so we're looking forward to
[21:37] that I also want to remind you that the
[21:40] the attire for the entire weekend is
[21:42] casual even during the services but as I
[21:45] always say it's casual but respectful
[21:48] so we can remember us guys don't need to
[21:51] come into service and in our sweaty
[21:53] athletic clothes that we were just
[21:55] yeah you know
[21:58] but we don't need a suit and a tie we
[21:59] don't need things like that it's casual
[22:01] but respectful when we come to service
[22:03] we still want to be respectful that
[22:04] we're coming to service but but we don't
[22:06] need to you know you don't need to get
[22:08] dressed up it's it's a it's a retreat we
[22:11] want to keep that atmosphere amen also
[22:13] want to remind you that Saturday night
[22:15] we'll be taking up the special missions
[22:17] offering we talked about that Wednesday
[22:19] There's a need in the Congo for the
[22:22] church that was not able to complete the
[22:24] building we'd like to help them as an
[22:26] assembly complete that so we're going to
[22:28] take up a a an offering Saturday night
[22:31] during the Saturday evening service
[22:32] we're going to take it up once that's
[22:34] the only time we'll take it so I
[22:35] encourage you to bring your money bring
[22:37] some funds if you want to write a check
[22:39] just write it out to BCF and just put in
[22:42] in the note missions and Brother Dean
[22:45] will take care of that but but would it
[22:48] be nice if we can all contribute even
[22:49] the children everybody everybody
[22:51] contribute so this is something that we
[22:54] can do together to bless another
[22:56] assembly while we're being blessed I
[22:58] mean I think it's a great opportunity to
[23:00] do something like that
[23:02] so amen so just remember to review your
[23:05] packet of information still don't have
[23:07] any word on brother Steve brasson I've
[23:11] talked to him he doesn't have his
[23:12] documentation yet and he says when is
[23:15] the deadline I said if you can get here
[23:17] by Thursday that's fine
[23:19] so what we've decided is we're gonna
[23:21] we're gonna make the call Tuesday night
[23:22] if he gets his documentation by Tuesday
[23:24] he can book tickets and he can come on
[23:27] and arrive on Thursday after that it's
[23:29] going to be too difficult so just keep
[23:30] praying amen we trust God that his will
[23:33] will come to pass perfectly and we're
[23:35] not nervous we're just excited to see
[23:37] what God will do brother Steve can't
[23:39] make it we'll we'll we'll still have a
[23:41] retreat and we'll fill in amen we'll
[23:43] have a good time
[23:45] some of us will be instant in season out
[23:47] of season
[23:48] praise the Lord
[23:50] amen as we look back to the scripture
[23:53] that we read together in Revelation
[23:55] chapter 10.
[23:56] it we're very familiar with the
[23:58] scripture because it's part of the
[24:01] manifestation of the word for our day
[24:03] this is the hour and the day that we're
[24:05] living in that says in the in the days
[24:07] of the voice of the seventh angel we
[24:09] know who that seventh angel is the
[24:11] prophet told us it's the seventh Earthly
[24:13] Angel of the seventh Church age
[24:14] messenger and that angel is William
[24:16] Branham
[24:17] amen the messenger of God and in the
[24:20] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[24:22] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[24:25] of God should be finished as he had
[24:27] declared to his servants the prophets
[24:29] so we find out through the message and
[24:31] we all are mostly most of us are all
[24:34] very familiar with the message been some
[24:36] of some of the things we say are going
[24:37] to be very much review amen but this is
[24:40] where we're at amen this is the age
[24:42] we're living in this is the awareness
[24:45] that God has brought us through this is
[24:46] the Awakening that he wants us to have
[24:48] is this Awakening in the mystery of God
[24:51] because the mystery of God is going to
[24:53] be finished the Revelation is going to
[24:55] come to what the mystery was that God
[24:57] held in the back part of his mind
[25:00] what was the one thing he wanted to
[25:02] accomplish what was the one purpose that
[25:04] he have what was he trying to achieve
[25:06] with all the Believers Through the Bible
[25:08] what is the scripture written for what
[25:11] what is this all about what were the
[25:13] prophets pointing to and what was the
[25:15] end time Prophet to reveal amen it's all
[25:18] this mystery that God held within
[25:20] himself from Before Time began before
[25:23] anything was created before he was even
[25:25] God when he was Elohim the self-existent
[25:28] one he had a desire he had a plan he had
[25:31] a he had something he wanted to
[25:33] accomplish and that is his mystery
[25:35] it's the mystery of God the mystery of
[25:37] himself
[25:39] and so this is the the place that we've
[25:41] come to and and I believe it's it's we I
[25:44] don't think we could ever emphasize it
[25:46] too much
[25:49] amen because this is the this was the
[25:53] thrust
[25:54] of brother brenham's Ministry everything
[25:55] he did was pointing to this all the
[25:58] foundation that was laid all the loosens
[26:01] that tied together all the signs and the
[26:03] Wonders everything was culminating into
[26:05] one thing and it was this Revelation and
[26:07] brother Branham said the seventh seal
[26:09] that is his ministry it was the ministry
[26:12] of the seventh angel was the seventh
[26:14] seal and his ministry of the seventh
[26:15] angel was Revelation 10 1-7
[26:18] he comes and he ties it together that
[26:20] was the point that was what he was
[26:22] getting to that was the that was the
[26:24] Pinnacle that was the capping of his of
[26:26] his ministry
[26:28] and so that's why I don't believe we
[26:30] could ever over emphasize it enough I
[26:33] believe it's something that we need to
[26:35] understand but in saying we need to
[26:37] understand it it's impossible to
[26:39] understand without Revelation from God
[26:42] it's not something we can press
[26:43] ourselves into but it is definitely
[26:45] something we can yield ourselves to
[26:48] surrender and open our ears and open our
[26:51] heart and pray that God will give us the
[26:53] revelation of the word
[26:54] and even though God reveals some of
[26:58] these things to us amen I I found and I
[27:01] know you found too that the Revelation
[27:03] is so vast so broad so deep that there's
[27:07] no end to it
[27:08] that it continues to unfold itself that
[27:11] it becomes more real day by day it
[27:13] becomes more Vivid it becomes more
[27:15] impactful amen and so I never want to
[27:18] stray away from that
[27:20] but we see that this great mystery of
[27:23] God
[27:24] in this day should be finished
[27:28] and I wanted to take for a title this
[27:31] morning and just preach on this for a
[27:32] while
[27:33] she is part of the mystery of God
[27:37] she is part of the mystery of God and
[27:40] let's go back to Genesis chapter 2 and
[27:43] begin there
[27:44] we're going to be covering a lot of
[27:46] familiar territory
[27:48] Genesis chapter 2 verse 21.
[27:56] if you think of what kind of people
[27:58] we've been privileged to be
[28:02] when
[28:04] Jesus was able to tell his disciples
[28:07] many prophets and Men of old have longed
[28:10] to see your day
[28:12] they've longed to see these things and
[28:15] you think about the men of God I mean
[28:17] Godly men men who dedicated their lives
[28:20] to God and through his word to teach it
[28:22] to search it and they had so many
[28:24] unanswered questions
[28:26] so many things that they couldn't
[28:28] connect the dots on they tried and they
[28:30] they tried to understand and they tried
[28:32] to stick with the scripture and there
[28:33] were so many things that they they just
[28:36] couldn't put their finger on and all
[28:37] their attempts and so and we live at the
[28:39] day that God has opened the seals and
[28:41] taken the veil off of his word and it's
[28:43] all open to be discovered we may not
[28:45] have discovered it all but it's all open
[28:47] to be discovered
[28:49] we find that in Daniel Daniel was asking
[28:51] when should these things be he wanted to
[28:53] know about the end time and he says go
[28:56] your way Daniel for it's sealed until
[28:57] the time of the end you'll never in all
[29:00] your program ever get it you'll never
[29:01] because it's sealed it's not open and we
[29:03] know there's seven Thunders sealed the
[29:06] mystery and they hid the mystery of the
[29:08] Seven Seals and it wasn't going to be
[29:10] open till the end time and these are
[29:12] Godly men who dedicated themselves holy
[29:15] to the word of God and no matter how
[29:17] dedicated they were amen it wasn't open
[29:19] to them
[29:21] but praise God it's open today amen and
[29:24] if they were that dedicated to see these
[29:27] things when it wasn't available now that
[29:29] it's available how dedicated should we
[29:31] be how sincere how Earnest because it's
[29:34] open
[29:35] it's not sealed away this is the time of
[29:37] the end and the Revelation has been
[29:39] given out
[29:41] like I said we may not see it all but
[29:43] it's available
[29:45] the potential is here the full potential
[29:48] is here there's nothing to hold it back
[29:50] amen because it's been open
[29:55] say God give us eyes to see
[29:57] and ears to hear Lord
[30:00] help me not in this day miss this
[30:03] glorious thing
[30:04] that you're doing
[30:06] but I want to see it more and more and I
[30:09] want to give myself holy to this word
[30:11] amen
[30:13] amen you think of some of the men who
[30:16] who sacrificed their very life just to
[30:19] have a Bible
[30:20] in their own language
[30:22] what would they give to have the open
[30:25] book
[30:27] they sacrificed their life they were in
[30:30] prison they were separated from their
[30:31] families they were chased from their
[30:33] homes all of these things they had their
[30:35] children separated from them they had
[30:36] all kinds of horrible abuses that took
[30:38] place just to have the written word in
[30:41] their language so that they could read
[30:42] it what would they give for the open
[30:45] book
[30:48] God help me not to waste my opportunity
[30:50] as my prayer Lord please help me not to
[30:53] miss what day I'm living in and help me
[30:55] not to miss my opportunity I've told you
[30:57] many times before but but I'll say it
[30:59] again if we could find twelve hundred
[31:03] authentic recorded messages of Paul the
[31:06] Apostle what do you believe would be the
[31:08] monetary value of that
[31:11] if they had an auction and they and
[31:13] months ahead the advertise there's an
[31:15] auction and we can verify these are
[31:17] authentic recorded sermons of the
[31:18] Apostle Paul we have 1200 of them as he
[31:21] traveled around the churches amen
[31:22] preaching and you can have all of these
[31:25] what would the monetary value be
[31:28] and we all have it in our pocket amen I
[31:31] don't want to lose the value because it
[31:33] didn't cost me I don't want to lose the
[31:35] value that I'm holding in my hand
[31:39] praise God
[31:40] such a blessing and I don't want to miss
[31:43] it and the problem is life still happens
[31:45] and we're still human and we still get
[31:47] distracted and we live in an age of
[31:49] distraction where the devil's trying
[31:51] hard to distract all the time but I want
[31:53] with all that's in me to fight it off
[31:54] amen because that's not what I want what
[31:57] I want is right here that's been given
[31:58] to me in this message
[32:00] I want it with all my heart and when I
[32:02] find myself distracted I've got to say
[32:04] no I'm not going this way amen God help
[32:06] me forgive me I want to stay true to
[32:09] what you've given to me
[32:12] in Genesis chapter 2 verse 21
[32:15] it says in the Lord God caused a deep
[32:17] sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and
[32:19] he took one of his ribs and closed up
[32:21] the flesh instead thereof and the rib
[32:23] which the Lord God had taken from man
[32:25] made he a woman and brought her unto the
[32:27] man and Adam said this is now bone of my
[32:29] bones flesh in my flesh she shall be
[32:32] called woman because she was taken out
[32:34] of man
[32:35] therefore shall a man leave his father
[32:37] and his mother shall cleave unto his
[32:39] wife and they shall be one flesh
[32:43] prophet of God says that's what the
[32:45] church is doing today for Jesus is the
[32:47] word and he is the bridegroom and the
[32:50] bride is part of the of the groom so we
[32:53] look at this all the way back in Adam
[32:54] and his wife and he was the bridegroom
[32:57] she was the bride the bride was
[32:58] literally part of Adam
[33:01] she was part of him because she was
[33:04] taken out of him
[33:06] and brother remember saying the same
[33:08] thing is true of the Bride because the
[33:10] bride is part of the groom
[33:12] therefore the word that is to be
[33:14] fulfilled this day is the same part of
[33:17] the word that was being fulfilled in his
[33:18] day and it's the same word same
[33:21] experience same life
[33:23] the same flesh that was spoken word made
[33:27] manifest in Adam because Adam was a
[33:30] spoken word made manifest
[33:32] and that spoken word may manifest when
[33:35] she was taken out of Adam and brought
[33:38] into a separate vessel we'll say or
[33:40] another form she was part of the spoken
[33:44] word manifestation she was part of Adam
[33:47] just because amen she was taken and
[33:50] formed to another figure didn't mean she
[33:52] was something different because she was
[33:54] taken out of the same substance
[33:58] she's just more of the same
[34:01] say it that way or another expression of
[34:04] the same
[34:06] amen so that's why he said the word is
[34:08] that is that is to be fulfilled this day
[34:10] is the same part of the word that was
[34:12] fulfilled in his day
[34:15] and so why is it the same because it
[34:17] comes from the same thing it's the word
[34:19] he was the word she was taken out of him
[34:21] she's part of the word
[34:27] and when God separated Adam he was both
[34:29] we find out Adam was Spirit to begin
[34:31] with he made man in his own image
[34:33] created him male and female and in
[34:35] Genesis 2 and on he created Out of the
[34:38] Dust of the earth Man was created in
[34:39] God's image God is a spirit so he's a
[34:42] spirit man then when he become flesh man
[34:45] animal flesh on the earth he is showing
[34:47] portraying here the bride he never taken
[34:51] and made another being but he took part
[34:53] of Adam the original creation
[34:57] took from him a rib from his side and
[34:59] took the feminist Spirit out of Adam
[35:00] left the masculine spirit in there and
[35:03] placed it in the feminist part therefore
[35:05] part of his Spirit part of his body
[35:08] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word
[35:11] of his word life of his life and that's
[35:13] the way the bride is to Christ
[35:16] [Music]
[35:17] amen
[35:20] so this is the mystery that's being
[35:22] revealed in our day
[35:24] this is the this is the the unveiling of
[35:28] God for our day
[35:32] in the unveiling of God for our day if
[35:35] if I could say make these statements
[35:37] amen and and you know we we all been
[35:40] together for a while now we Fellowship
[35:41] around this word for a while so I I I I
[35:44] don't feel the pressure to validate
[35:46] every statement I make you know the
[35:48] message you can go and read it but the
[35:50] unveiling of God today amen is really
[35:53] the unveiling of the feminine parts
[35:56] [Music]
[35:58] amen it was the part that left was left
[36:00] mysterious
[36:02] because when Christ came on the scene he
[36:05] was the mystery of God revealed amen
[36:07] he was the invisible God made visible he
[36:10] was the invisible God made into flesh
[36:12] and and he was he was the express image
[36:15] or the exact replica the exact image of
[36:18] God now imprinted into flesh amen and
[36:21] and so now if you wanted to see God you
[36:24] look to Jesus Christ
[36:26] right
[36:28] but that was the mystery of God being
[36:31] unveiled in that day that was part of
[36:34] the unveiling of God that was a great
[36:36] unveiling in his son Christ Jesus amen
[36:39] but veiled within Jesus was another
[36:41] mystery
[36:43] another layer to the mystery a different
[36:45] mystery same mystery amen same mystery
[36:48] just another layer of the mystery was
[36:51] still sealed behind the veil of Jesus
[36:53] Christ's flesh and that flesh was the
[36:56] word made flash amen so the word was
[36:59] made Flash and within that word was
[37:02] other portions of word in that word and
[37:05] those other portions of word were to be
[37:07] you and I
[37:09] amen
[37:11] amen just like the woman was veiled
[37:15] inside of Adam so when Adam come he was
[37:18] the son of God God said let us make man
[37:20] in our image and our likeness amen so
[37:22] now Adam coming down Spirit form and
[37:25] then moving into flesh form he was a
[37:28] mystery of God revealed
[37:31] he was the unveiling of something of God
[37:33] because God said let us make man in our
[37:35] image and our likeness amen so God is
[37:37] now reflecting himself in the son that
[37:39] he's making and so there's a mystery
[37:42] being unveiled in Adam but within Adam
[37:44] is another layer of the mystery because
[37:47] God said let us make man in our image
[37:49] and he made them male and female and
[37:51] when he made them male and female they
[37:53] were still in one form so in that form
[37:55] was another layer to the mystery of God
[37:59] man
[38:00] amen
[38:02] praise God
[38:05] I tell you friends
[38:07] never
[38:09] could this gospel be preached like this
[38:11] until this day
[38:15] I mean sometimes there's times while I'm
[38:18] preaching I'll be preaching under
[38:20] inspiration say something and it takes
[38:22] my literally takes my breath away
[38:25] sometimes I want to I want to stop in
[38:27] the middle of preaching and just go
[38:28] kneel down and cry and pray and say oh
[38:30] God this is the reality
[38:34] this isn't something fun to preach it's
[38:37] not a neat topic this is the absolute
[38:39] reality of our life this is the hour
[38:41] that we live in this is the moment in
[38:43] time we're here this is where we need to
[38:45] prick ourselves pinch ourselves amen
[38:47] because this isn't another neat sermon
[38:49] this isn't a nice title this isn't
[38:51] another thing to entice people to
[38:53] enthuse them to get them to clap their
[38:54] hands this is the living reality of God
[38:57] unveiling himself in our day
[39:00] it is the gospel it is the word on
[39:02] display it is the very thing that God is
[39:05] doing in our day
[39:08] amen more than a sermon for us
[39:13] amen
[39:17] so
[39:19] we keep moving now
[39:22] in Genesis 3 Verse 6 he says when the
[39:25] woman saw that the tree was good for
[39:27] food that it was pleasant to the eyes
[39:29] and a tree to be desired to make one
[39:31] wise she took her the fruit thereof and
[39:33] did eat and gave also unto her husband
[39:34] with her and he did eat
[39:38] brother man says and I'm going to be
[39:40] referencing Christ as the mystery of God
[39:41] revealed and I'm going to quote from
[39:43] that uh quite a bit today
[39:45] and I just went through it again slowly
[39:47] just recently and and every time I read
[39:50] that message it does something to me
[39:53] it it fires me up
[39:57] he says he typed himself in Adam knowing
[40:00] what was right but walked out to redeem
[40:03] his wife because she was wrong
[40:05] Christ didn't have to be sin he walked
[40:07] out and took sin to redeem his Lost
[40:09] Child
[40:12] and there's a reference here to First
[40:14] Timothy two I'll read it to you first
[40:15] Timothy 2 13. it says for Adam was first
[40:18] formed then even Adam was not deceived
[40:21] but the woman being deceived was in the
[40:23] transgression
[40:25] see Adam
[40:27] wasn't deceived by the beguiling of the
[40:30] serpent
[40:32] he knew the word and he knew what was
[40:34] right and wrong
[40:36] but he chose to go with his wife amen
[40:39] because she was his wife because he
[40:42] loved her
[40:43] but it's so deep friends because if you
[40:47] think about it Adam
[40:50] Adam had to make a choice
[40:54] so she partook of the fruit that she
[40:57] gave also to her husband now comes his
[40:59] choice
[41:00] will he partake and will he go with her
[41:03] and he partook and we know according to
[41:06] the Apostle Paul that he was not
[41:07] deceived he knew full well what he was
[41:09] doing
[41:11] it but I would say it this way
[41:14] he had no choice
[41:16] he had a choice but he had no choice
[41:19] because what had just Fallen to the sin
[41:22] wasn't someone else what had just Fallen
[41:25] to sin was him
[41:27] what had just gotten deceived was
[41:29] himself
[41:30] it was you know it's not as though he
[41:33] can say uh you know good luck you're on
[41:35] your own I you shouldn't have done that
[41:37] but I'm going to save myself this is
[41:39] himself
[41:42] it's not he can't listen he he cannot
[41:46] say I'm going to stay in
[41:48] self-preservation I'm going to let you
[41:49] take the hit you go you messed up big
[41:51] you go but I want to stay alive no when
[41:54] she dies he dies when she falls he falls
[41:56] when she separated he separated he he
[42:00] had a choice but he had no choice
[42:01] because she was him
[42:05] amen do we understand
[42:08] and so as the drama plays out of course
[42:10] he has to make a choice it has to be
[42:12] free will we understand all of these
[42:13] things but in reality what else was he
[42:16] going to do that was him she was him
[42:19] that was himself her name was Adam
[42:28] now we see why he loved us and now why
[42:31] we see why he redeemed us
[42:33] [Music]
[42:34] oh praise be to God
[42:38] in the messages the rising of the sun
[42:40] says look notice but God listen God
[42:43] foresaw the bride in the groom
[42:47] it's exactly what happened with Adam
[42:48] when when he says to Adam multiply and
[42:52] replenish the Earth amen he foresaw the
[42:55] bride in the groom
[42:57] he knew what he was saying he knew how
[43:00] it would be accomplished he had a plan
[43:01] and he had a purpose and he knew that he
[43:03] was going to have to give his son a
[43:05] bride to reproduce himself upon the
[43:07] Earth and when God said multiply and
[43:10] replenish amen the woman had not come
[43:12] into a separate expression she was still
[43:14] locked inside as a mystery inside of
[43:17] Adam but he said multiply and replenish
[43:19] she was part of Adam when the
[43:21] Commandment came to Adam the Commandment
[43:23] also came to her
[43:25] yeah
[43:26] yeah that's why also while she was in
[43:28] Adam when the Commandment came there
[43:29] shall not touch either the tree the
[43:31] knowledge of Good and Evil amen when
[43:33] that came to Adam it came to her also
[43:35] because she was there amen she was part
[43:38] of Amen that that dispensation she was
[43:41] part of that word going forth and when
[43:42] God said when God said multiply and
[43:45] replenish the Earth he foresaw the bride
[43:48] in the groom he knew exactly what was
[43:50] going to happen
[43:52] he knew how he was going to bring it to
[43:54] pass he knew he was going to bring Adam
[43:55] into another manifestation unite the two
[43:57] together and he was going to reproduce
[43:59] himself upon the Earth
[44:01] God already knew it
[44:06] so if God foresaw the bride in the groom
[44:08] there
[44:09] what did he foresee in the groom
[44:12] here
[44:15] it says hallelujah seek to save his wife
[44:17] like Adam he had to go with her Adam
[44:19] knowed that he was what he was doing Eve
[44:21] didn't know what she was doing but Adam
[44:23] walked out with his wife and Jesus took
[44:25] his wife's place and became sin for her
[44:27] because he became you he stood your
[44:30] punishment that you might stand in his
[44:32] place
[44:33] he stood in your place that you might
[44:35] stand in his place what love what a
[44:38] fellowship
[44:41] Amen in the message of modern events he
[44:45] says but the real ordained of God that
[44:48] real Gene that real germ a soul of God
[44:51] that was in God before the foundation of
[44:53] the world remember you that's really got
[44:55] the spirit of God in you tonight you
[44:57] were here in Christ
[44:59] because he was the fullness of the word
[45:03] he was the fullness of the godhead
[45:05] bodily God was in Christ reconciling the
[45:07] world to himself do you believe that
[45:08] look he was in Christ then if you were
[45:12] in God a gene a word a attribute from
[45:16] the beginning then you walked with him
[45:18] here on the Earth
[45:20] you talked with him on the earth you
[45:22] suffered with him on the earth you died
[45:24] with him at Calvary you Rose with him
[45:26] again and now you're sitting in Heavenly
[45:28] places in Christ Jesus communing with
[45:31] him the word as it feeds into your soul
[45:38] praise God I I don't know why I don't
[45:41] know how but I believe that to be
[45:43] nothing but the truth and I believe it
[45:45] applies to me
[45:50] amen
[45:52] so
[45:54] if we are part of the gene of God
[45:57] an attribute of God a word of God a gene
[45:59] of God part of the original thought of
[46:02] God
[46:03] I would say part is the mystery of God
[46:06] is that fair to say
[46:08] if we're part of the mystery of God
[46:11] then all of that mystery all of that
[46:13] word all of those attributes was poured
[46:15] into Christ because all that God was he
[46:18] poured into Christ amen he was the
[46:19] fullness of the godhead bodily amen he
[46:22] was the word made flash he was the
[46:24] fullness of God in one body and if
[46:27] that's be true and I be part of God and
[46:30] part of the word then I was in him the
[46:33] same way Eve the woman was in her
[46:35] husband
[46:36] and he foresaw the bride in the
[46:39] bridegroom
[46:42] amen
[46:44] let's go to Ephesians chapter 5 now
[46:47] together
[46:56] Ephesians chapter 5.
[47:00] read verse 25. Ephesians 5 and verse 25.
[47:10] in Ephesians 5 25 says husband love your
[47:12] wives even as Christ also loved the
[47:14] church and gave himself for it
[47:18] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[47:20] with the washing of Water by the word
[47:21] that he might present it to himself a
[47:24] glorious church not having spot or
[47:25] wrinkle or any such thing but this
[47:27] should be holy and without blemish so
[47:29] want men to love their wives as their
[47:32] own bodies he that loveth his wife
[47:34] loveth himself
[47:36] oh now is that not a revelation
[47:40] let's take it beyond the natural
[47:43] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[47:48] why does Christ love me so
[47:54] praise God
[47:56] let's look look at verse 32.
[47:59] this is a great mystery but I speak
[48:01] concerning Christ and the church
[48:04] what's he talking about when he says men
[48:06] loves your wives as you love yourself
[48:08] amen what's he talking about he's
[48:09] talking about Christ in the church
[48:11] so let's go back up and read this again
[48:13] in verse 28 so ought men to love their
[48:15] wives as their own bodies he that loveth
[48:18] his wife loveth himself
[48:21] that's why it was such a mystery back in
[48:25] the previous dispensations and that
[48:27] there was so many Mysteries and that
[48:30] that and so much uh a lack of
[48:33] understanding and I don't mean that
[48:34] derogatory it's just the seals weren't
[48:36] open the veil wasn't taken off the word
[48:38] there was still a great mystery to this
[48:40] plan of God but there was there was such
[48:43] songs that we would sing like I have no
[48:46] idea why he wanted me I I don't know why
[48:48] he loves me I can't see why he would
[48:50] love me but that song's not applicable
[48:53] today
[48:55] because we know why because we were part
[48:57] of himself amen we know why he loved us
[49:00] we know that Redemption wasn't that he
[49:02] looked down and he saw some poor people
[49:04] that were going to be in a bad State one
[49:05] day and he had sympathy for them and
[49:07] felt sorry for them and said I think
[49:09] I'll save them no he was redeeming
[49:11] himself amen he was saving his children
[49:13] his attributes himself amen and it
[49:16] doesn't mean that you shouldn't still
[49:18] and The Human Side be awed by that say
[49:20] I'm so amazed that he loved me we should
[49:22] say that I'm amazed that he loved me
[49:23] humanly thinking I don't understand why
[49:25] but the Revelation has come to pierce
[49:28] beyond the human understanding and say I
[49:31] do know why he loved me amen because the
[49:33] prophet told me why he loved me the
[49:34] scriptures tell me why he loved me
[49:36] and now I know why I love him because he
[49:39] first loved me and he loved me because
[49:40] no man ever yet hated his own flesh his
[49:43] own body
[49:44] amen he that loveth his wife loveth
[49:46] himself
[49:49] amen
[49:52] why why is it so important that we
[49:54] understand these things in this day
[49:55] because it brings such a rest and such a
[49:58] security and such a stability because if
[50:00] we have no idea why he would choose me a
[50:02] poor retro sinner why he would pick me
[50:04] when I was So Unworthy and so unlovable
[50:07] and we have no idea why then we're not
[50:09] going to understand why he still deals
[50:11] with us when we're filthy and miserable
[50:12] and backslide and fall
[50:15] because his choice preceded our
[50:17] condition his choice preceded our
[50:20] failures amen because his choice
[50:22] preceded our failures our failures can't
[50:24] change his choice
[50:29] so the Revelation brings a rest
[50:33] and the whole Christian experience is
[50:35] based on rest
[50:37] not this constant being so I don't even
[50:39] know why he would pick me I'm just a
[50:42] worthless nothing well I mean obviously
[50:44] we all agree with you you're a worthless
[50:45] nothing but but there's something beyond
[50:48] that amen
[50:52] amen when you want to get up and make
[50:54] yourself a worm and say I I don't know
[50:56] why you chose me I'm the least I'm the
[50:57] worst I'm no good and I say amen I mean
[51:00] I'll send my seat and say Amen
[51:02] so I'm not even worthy to stand here and
[51:04] you you only better me amen I'll keep
[51:06] saying amen because I agree with you
[51:10] but let's go beyond that and get to the
[51:12] reality amen it's not me there's
[51:15] something in me amen that's beyond this
[51:17] flesh that was part of God that was
[51:19] meant to be me a desire that he had to
[51:21] express himself and he wanted to express
[51:23] himself as an attribute as a son that he
[51:25] wanted to be me the real me and that's
[51:28] the part that he's loving that's the
[51:29] part that he's after
[51:31] amen
[51:34] praise God
[51:37] you see how necessary the Revelation is
[51:39] to break old denominational thinking
[51:41] that constantly has the devil pulling us
[51:43] here and pulling us there
[51:46] amen
[51:48] praise God
[51:51] so let's continue on in the scripture 28
[51:54] so what men to love their wives as their
[51:56] own bodies he's in love with his wife
[51:57] loveth himself
[51:59] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[52:01] but nourisheth and cherishes it even as
[52:04] the Lord the church
[52:06] for we are members of his body
[52:09] of his flesh and of his bones
[52:14] I don't know how plainer it can be
[52:20] for this cause shall a man leave his
[52:21] father and mother and shall be joined
[52:23] into his wife and they too shall be one
[52:26] flesh this is a great mystery but I
[52:29] speak concerning Christ and the church
[52:33] so where is the Flesh and bone of Jesus
[52:36] Christ
[52:39] it is his church it is his bride she is
[52:42] the literal body of Jesus Christ the
[52:45] same as the woman was the literal body
[52:47] of Adam amen she wasn't all of Adam
[52:50] because Adam was all of Adam she wasn't
[52:53] a replacement for Adam she was another
[52:56] expression of Adam and she was a further
[52:59] expression of Adam and she was part of
[53:01] the body of Adam because she was taken
[53:03] out of the body of Adam and given
[53:05] another expression so it's another
[53:06] expression of the body of Adam Adam oh
[53:09] I'm going to say something Adam had two
[53:11] bodies
[53:14] amen
[53:16] is that not what the uh Genesis chapter
[53:19] 5 says and the day he created them he
[53:21] made them male and female and called
[53:22] their name Adam
[53:24] Adam had two bodies
[53:31] I I know that's shocking if you're stuck
[53:34] in denominational thinking it's
[53:35] absolutely shocking amen but the reality
[53:38] is that is the scripture amen Jesus
[53:41] never lost his body we know that that
[53:43] flesh body that was nailed to a cross it
[53:46] ascended on high as a representation of
[53:48] a sacrifice Amen to mediate for us he
[53:51] had to take that sacrifice back behind
[53:53] the veil Amen to redeem us and pay for
[53:55] the price for fallen man we know that
[53:57] that body didn't disintegrate that body
[53:59] didn't severe he still has that body
[54:02] amen but he has another body on Earth
[54:05] and that's the body of his bride the
[54:07] body of his church and it is the bones
[54:09] it's the Flesh and Bones of Christ
[54:12] so Jesus Christ has two bodies
[54:17] I mean I hope I don't get labeled as a
[54:19] heretic for believing the Bible
[54:25] amen
[54:27] it's just shocking remember how brother
[54:29] Branham said many true ministers
[54:33] will misunderstand the message because
[54:36] they were taught scripture in a certain
[54:37] way
[54:39] yes yes
[54:41] is it good ministers true ministers they
[54:45] will misunderstand the seven things was
[54:47] messaged they will misunderstand because
[54:49] they were taught scripture in a certain
[54:51] way
[54:52] I'll tell you friends because of the
[54:54] denominational systems
[54:56] the scriptures were taught wrong
[55:00] and many times our original
[55:02] understanding of the scriptures even
[55:04] what creeped into the message
[55:07] is not the true revelation of those
[55:09] scriptures they make sense
[55:10] intellectually they're logical to the
[55:13] language but they are not the revelation
[55:14] of that scripture
[55:16] because the prophet came to give us the
[55:18] perfect interpretation of the word with
[55:20] Divine Vindication and many times he
[55:21] would say that scripture means that and
[55:23] it's the opposite of what I thought it
[55:25] meant
[55:26] so then I'm faced with a challenge do I
[55:28] stick with my forefathers do I stick
[55:30] with uh Wesley do I do I stick with all
[55:33] the Bible commentaries or do I stick
[55:34] with the prophet that God sent to
[55:36] interpret the word
[55:39] amen
[55:40] and that's why so many people have a
[55:43] hard time understanding the message
[55:44] today
[55:48] they had a hard time understanding the
[55:50] message in Jesus day
[55:52] because of their understanding of the
[55:55] scriptures
[56:00] absolutely the truth
[56:02] they had trouble understanding the
[56:04] message in Jesus's day because of their
[56:06] understanding of the scriptures
[56:08] the way they understood the scriptures
[56:10] confused them about the manifestation of
[56:12] the word before the right when the
[56:14] scripture was made plain and flesh
[56:16] before them and interpreted they didn't
[56:18] understand it because of the way they
[56:19] had been taught the scriptures
[56:23] I said God be my teacher
[56:25] teach me the scriptures Lord
[56:31] you've opened the he's opened the
[56:34] scriptures now open my understanding to
[56:36] understand the scriptures that you've
[56:37] opened
[56:39] it's so needful
[56:42] so
[56:43] we are members of his body of his flesh
[56:48] and of his bones
[56:51] this is a further expression of Christ
[56:56] it's Christ expressing in church form
[56:59] bride form
[57:01] feminine form
[57:03] his body a continuation of his body
[57:09] brother man I've got questions and
[57:10] questions and answers on the seals when
[57:12] he comes and he does that uh on the
[57:15] seals
[57:16] the question is is the bride of Christ
[57:17] and the body of Christ the same
[57:20] he said yes sir
[57:22] that's pretty easy
[57:24] yes sir he said now I don't want to get
[57:26] started on that because I'll preach a
[57:28] sermon on it I won't do that but I want
[57:31] to show you when God gave adam his bride
[57:33] from his side she is flesh of his flesh
[57:35] bone of his bone is that right when God
[57:37] give Christ his bride the spirit gave
[57:39] the flesh the bride he was pierced in
[57:42] the side under his heart and water blood
[57:44] and Spirit came forth that became flesh
[57:46] of his flesh bone of his boom We Are The
[57:49] Flesh and Bones the bride will be the
[57:51] Flesh and Bones of Christ
[57:56] praise God
[57:58] it's hard to argue with the prophet and
[58:01] the prophet
[58:04] like the prophet brother man when the
[58:05] prophet Paul the Apostle it's hard to
[58:07] argue with those two Prophets
[58:09] when they Converge on anything I mean
[58:11] it's pretty tight
[58:14] in First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 27
[58:17] it says now ye are the body of Christ
[58:21] now you are the body of Christ and
[58:24] members in particular so that makes you
[58:26] just a part of that body
[58:29] amen and Paul the Apostle learned this
[58:32] firsthand when he was on the road to
[58:34] Damascus and on the road to Damascus
[58:37] amen you know you've struck down by a
[58:38] pillar of fire and the pillar of fire
[58:40] spoke to him and said Saul Saul why
[58:42] persecutives thou me and he says Lord
[58:44] who are thou and he says I am Jesus whom
[58:47] you persecuted Paul immediately his
[58:49] Doctrine changed
[58:51] and a fraction of a moment all of a
[58:53] sudden he caught a revelation amen you
[58:55] weren't talking about catching a
[58:56] revelation he caught a revelation those
[58:59] people he was holding the prison those
[59:00] people that he was persecuting amen that
[59:03] was Jesus Christ
[59:07] is that also the Bible
[59:09] why persecuted on me Jesus wasn't
[59:12] persecuting Jesus at this stage Jesus
[59:15] had already been crucified dead and
[59:16] resurrected there's nothing he could do
[59:19] to that form of Jesus
[59:22] but now Jesus was in another body in
[59:25] another form and he was persecuting
[59:27] Jesus by persecuting his body
[59:30] the church
[59:32] so you see that's that's so scripturally
[59:35] sound
[59:37] and the message spoken word is the
[59:39] Original Seed he says and the angel
[59:41] showed Abraham who he was and that he
[59:44] was the word and why did Sarah laugh so
[59:46] he called her forth and she said I never
[59:49] but he said but you did
[59:51] what the grace right there God would
[59:54] have slew her right there but he
[59:56] couldn't
[59:58] see our stupidity he'd kill every one of
[1:00:00] us but he can't
[1:00:02] to kill Sarah he had to take Abraham
[1:00:05] because Sarah was part of Abraham
[1:00:10] they were one in Union and to take the
[1:00:12] church and destroy it he can't do it
[1:00:16] because it's part of himself
[1:00:20] Hey listen have we failed we failed
[1:00:24] has the church failed they have
[1:00:26] absolutely failed have we of individuals
[1:00:28] failed we have failed
[1:00:30] but to take us and destroy us he can't
[1:00:33] do it
[1:00:34] because it's part of himself and God
[1:00:38] cannot lose himself Christ cannot be
[1:00:42] condemned Christ cannot be destroyed
[1:00:45] amen
[1:00:47] amen because it's part of himself Christ
[1:00:48] part of himself the word being made
[1:00:51] flesh
[1:00:52] Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound
[1:00:54] couldn't do it you get it he couldn't
[1:00:56] kill her he couldn't take her life
[1:00:58] because she was part of Abraham she was
[1:00:59] flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone
[1:01:01] why that goes all the way back to a
[1:01:03] prophecy that Adam laid out when a man
[1:01:05] is joined to his wife they will be flesh
[1:01:08] of his flesh and bone of his bone and
[1:01:09] they will be one flesh
[1:01:12] and God honored that Amen in the
[1:01:14] marriage and he honored that in Abraham
[1:01:16] and Sarah they had become one flesh she
[1:01:18] was now part of Abraham and he could not
[1:01:21] destroy her without destroying Abraham
[1:01:23] he couldn't hurt her without hurting
[1:01:25] Abraham amen and so now he cannot hurt
[1:01:27] us without hurting Christ
[1:01:31] why because they're one flesh
[1:01:34] he said but you couldn't take the church
[1:01:36] he can't kill the elected he can't take
[1:01:38] your life because you're part of him
[1:01:40] you're the word
[1:01:42] the word is in you it's manifest itself
[1:01:45] proving itself love joy peace long
[1:01:47] suffering all the words of God you
[1:01:48] believe every one of them them work and
[1:01:51] God working through you you're a part of
[1:01:53] the word which is Christ and we are
[1:01:55] taught that he is the word and we are
[1:01:57] flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone
[1:01:59] there you are
[1:02:02] amen amen
[1:02:04] you were talking about a doctrine of
[1:02:06] eternal security
[1:02:11] amen
[1:02:13] the the Calvinism teacher they thought
[1:02:15] they had it but they did not have it the
[1:02:18] prophet had it
[1:02:20] he could go beyond that and go all the
[1:02:22] way back to the back part of God's mind
[1:02:24] and show eternal security before there
[1:02:26] was time
[1:02:30] oh praise be to God
[1:02:32] and the message is the rising of the sun
[1:02:33] he says and as he being the groom
[1:02:37] the bride has to come forth because it's
[1:02:39] part of him
[1:02:40] and it can only be the manifestation the
[1:02:42] fulfilling of all the revelations any
[1:02:45] others has spoke of the Bride it can
[1:02:47] only manifest if it does something
[1:02:48] different from the groom it isn't the
[1:02:50] bride because she is flesh of his flesh
[1:02:52] bone of his bone life of his life power
[1:02:54] of his power she is him
[1:03:00] as man and woman are one and woman taken
[1:03:02] from his side she had taken a spirit the
[1:03:05] feminist Spirit from him the flesh from
[1:03:07] his side made both mechanics and
[1:03:09] Dynamics the wife the spirit of him the
[1:03:11] Flesh of him and put it together and
[1:03:13] made mechanics and Dynamics amen she is
[1:03:18] him
[1:03:21] so my brother Brandon would come in the
[1:03:23] seals
[1:03:25] and he would say now I'm going to call
[1:03:27] you bride
[1:03:29] so that you'll get it there's something
[1:03:30] you have to understand it's got to go to
[1:03:32] a different level like church is a
[1:03:34] correct term but I'm not going to use
[1:03:36] church because it's too General I'm
[1:03:37] going to call you bride so that you're
[1:03:39] going to get what I'm talking about in
[1:03:41] these seals
[1:03:44] and the message it is the rising of the
[1:03:45] sun he says when God made his first
[1:03:47] bridegroom
[1:03:49] he made the bridegroom first and he was
[1:03:50] both man and woman and spirit formed him
[1:03:53] in the dust of the earth to make him
[1:03:54] material and notice when he made Eve
[1:03:57] from Adam he took not another piece of
[1:03:58] clay he took from the same piece of clay
[1:04:00] the same word for Adam was a spoken word
[1:04:05] he took him he took from him and then
[1:04:07] taken he had a masculine and feminine
[1:04:09] Spirit then he took the feminine spirit
[1:04:10] away from Adam and placed it in Eve so
[1:04:13] it's still part of Adam's spirit
[1:04:15] to catch that
[1:04:19] it wasn't Eve Spirit although it was the
[1:04:22] feminine Spirit but it was the feminine
[1:04:24] part of Adam's spirit
[1:04:25] [Music]
[1:04:26] so it was Adam's Spirit yes What Spirit
[1:04:29] did you have Adam's spirit
[1:04:31] praise God
[1:04:33] and even though there was a difference
[1:04:35] in expression
[1:04:37] now there's masking now there's a
[1:04:38] division of where it was all masculine
[1:04:40] feminist in one now there's a division
[1:04:42] of expression the expression comes forth
[1:04:44] the the physical form is slightly
[1:04:47] different the expression is slightly
[1:04:49] different but it's the same
[1:04:51] it shows how you can be the same but
[1:04:53] different
[1:04:54] she was never there to replace Adam now
[1:04:56] she can't say well I'm Adam and you're
[1:04:58] nothing no he was Adam amen she was Adam
[1:05:01] he was Adam she was Adam she was another
[1:05:03] expression of Adam
[1:05:06] Adam's spirit
[1:05:09] it's Adam's flesh
[1:05:12] then it was Adam's Spirit the dynamic
[1:05:14] that quickened the mechanics of his body
[1:05:18] so the the bride must also be flesh of
[1:05:21] his flesh bone of his bone
[1:05:23] then how is this mortal flesh going to
[1:05:26] become his flesh
[1:05:29] it says we'll get to that in a minute
[1:05:32] and see how it's done
[1:05:35] it's a question I want you to hold in
[1:05:37] your heart for a minute
[1:05:38] how is this mortal flesh going to become
[1:05:42] his flesh
[1:05:45] then he goes to a scripture and I like
[1:05:47] to read this scripture together if you
[1:05:48] will let's go to Romans chapter 8.
[1:05:53] he's going to start showing us how this
[1:05:55] mortal flesh
[1:05:57] can become his flesh
[1:06:02] Romans chapter 8
[1:06:16] okay
[1:06:18] verse 8 let's start at verse 8. he's
[1:06:20] going to only read one script scripture
[1:06:22] but I want to back up and catch more
[1:06:24] context Romans 8 8.
[1:06:26] so then they that are in the flesh
[1:06:28] cannot please God
[1:06:30] but you're not in the flesh but in the
[1:06:32] spirit if so be that the spirit of God
[1:06:34] dwell on you now if any man have not the
[1:06:36] spirit of Christ he is none of his and
[1:06:39] if Christ be in you the body is dead
[1:06:42] because of sin but the spirit is life
[1:06:44] because of righteousness
[1:06:46] and this is the verse that he reads
[1:06:48] verse 11 but if the spirit of him that
[1:06:50] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:06:52] you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:06:54] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[1:06:55] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[1:06:58] you
[1:07:00] brother members going to start showing
[1:07:01] us how this mortal flesh can become his
[1:07:04] flesh
[1:07:06] and he says if the spirit of him that
[1:07:08] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:07:10] you
[1:07:11] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:07:12] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:07:15] a spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:07:16] until I came to the message being raised
[1:07:19] in church raised all my life in church
[1:07:21] reading my Bible all of my life if you
[1:07:24] would have asked me to read that
[1:07:25] scripture and interpret it to you before
[1:07:27] the message I would have told you that
[1:07:30] that's a promise of Resurrection that
[1:07:32] after I die if I die with the spirit the
[1:07:34] spirit of God being me he'll raise me up
[1:07:36] but brother Branham does not handle this
[1:07:38] scripture that way he's not speaking of
[1:07:41] a resurrection after you physically die
[1:07:43] in the resurrection of the Saints but
[1:07:45] the Rapture time that is not how he
[1:07:47] views this scripture
[1:07:50] if we view that scripture only that way
[1:07:53] then we're going to miss the power that
[1:07:55] is unlocked in this scripture because
[1:07:57] this is how our mortal flesh will become
[1:08:00] his flesh
[1:08:03] again in the message the rising of the
[1:08:06] sun were just a few paragraphs later he
[1:08:07] said but brother when you hear the
[1:08:09] scream there's something in you you're
[1:08:10] an eagle to begin with you are that seed
[1:08:14] that the resurrection of the son has
[1:08:17] dawned and the wave Chief upon the Earth
[1:08:20] where was that
[1:08:22] to make you recognize that you're an ego
[1:08:24] and not a denominational chicken
[1:08:27] what was what was the the rising of the
[1:08:30] sun brother man is preaching it is the
[1:08:32] rising of the Sun and he's showing the
[1:08:33] resurrection of the son he's saying the
[1:08:36] Sun is up he's not talking about just 2
[1:08:39] 000 years ago a resurrection that was
[1:08:41] the resurrection of Jesus body amen but
[1:08:44] in coming out of the Dark Ages there had
[1:08:46] to be another resurrection and it had to
[1:08:48] be a resurrection of the word amen
[1:08:51] and he says so now the resurrection of
[1:08:53] the son has dawned and the wave Chief
[1:08:57] upon the Earth
[1:08:58] to make you recognize that you're an
[1:09:01] eagle and not a denominational chicken
[1:09:03] so all of a sudden what was the return
[1:09:05] of the word for why did the light come
[1:09:07] back amen why did the wave Chief get
[1:09:09] waived what was it all to do it was to
[1:09:12] help you and I recognize that we're an
[1:09:14] eagle and not a denominational chicken
[1:09:16] not so that we can say isn't that
[1:09:18] glorious the words return Isn't that
[1:09:20] glorious there was a way she it is
[1:09:22] glorious it was glorious but for me
[1:09:24] there's a greater glory in the
[1:09:25] Revelation that that came to unlock and
[1:09:28] who I am
[1:09:31] if I see that the son has risen and I
[1:09:35] see that the wave Chief went forth and I
[1:09:37] see that Malachi 4 has been on the earth
[1:09:39] and I can see that there's been a voice
[1:09:41] of the seventh angel but I don't see
[1:09:43] what that means to me then I have missed
[1:09:46] the purpose of God sending all of them
[1:09:52] I can rejoice
[1:09:55] in the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 I can
[1:09:58] rejoice in the wave she's being waved I
[1:10:01] can rejoice in the word returning and
[1:10:04] still blind and stuck in spiritual
[1:10:07] Amnesia and not really understanding who
[1:10:10] I am
[1:10:12] and if that's the case I haven't yet got
[1:10:15] the full benefit
[1:10:17] of Malachi 4 Revelation 10 7.
[1:10:20] the wave sheath the rising of the Sun
[1:10:29] he goes and says
[1:10:31] if the spirit that raised him from the
[1:10:32] dead now he's coming back to the
[1:10:34] scripture
[1:10:35] if the spirit they raised him from the
[1:10:37] dead the word the dynamic of the word
[1:10:40] dwells in you
[1:10:42] it also quickens your mortal body
[1:10:46] amen not will someday down the road
[1:10:48] after you're dead and laying in the
[1:10:49] grave and the Resurrection comes now
[1:10:51] he's talking about if that Spirit which
[1:10:54] is what the Dynamics of the word that
[1:10:56] you've received amen it dwells in you it
[1:10:58] also quickens your mortal body
[1:11:01] now he goes back to the question now how
[1:11:04] wave flesh of his flesh and bone of his
[1:11:06] bone he said I'll answer that in just a
[1:11:08] few minutes now we'll hear a few
[1:11:09] paragraphs later he's going to say how
[1:11:11] now how are we flesh of his flesh and
[1:11:12] bone of his bone because
[1:11:16] here comes the answer yeah yeah quickly
[1:11:19] why were you were yet mortal Sinners
[1:11:21] mortal ready to die these bodies it
[1:11:24] quickens that body what's Quicken brings
[1:11:27] to life the spirit that once liked to
[1:11:29] drink run around commit adultery and all
[1:11:31] these it's quick and why the thing died
[1:11:34] and you are Resurrected
[1:11:37] it quickens your mortal body Therefore
[1:11:40] your bodies is the Temple of the
[1:11:42] Dynamics because why from the beginning
[1:11:44] you are part of the mechanics
[1:11:48] there is your Resurrection this is the
[1:11:52] definition this is the interpretation of
[1:11:54] Romans 8 11 not someday if I receive the
[1:11:57] Holy Ghost I have a Resurrection coming
[1:11:59] if I receive the Holy Ghost it is my
[1:12:01] Resurrection coming
[1:12:03] yeah I'm in the Resurrection The
[1:12:05] Resurrection is in me I'm resurrected
[1:12:08] from Death from the deadness of an old
[1:12:10] mortal flesh and old Mortal ideas and
[1:12:13] resurrected with newness why because the
[1:12:16] the Dynamics of that word the life of
[1:12:19] the word has come in me to make this
[1:12:21] body live that word that I believe
[1:12:26] there is
[1:12:30] there is 8 11. amen there is the correct
[1:12:32] interpretation not the denomination but
[1:12:34] the correct one
[1:12:38] now when you go back and read it it's so
[1:12:40] obvious
[1:12:42] so so they then are then in the flesh
[1:12:44] cannot please God so I have to die to
[1:12:46] please God yes
[1:12:48] but not the death you're thinking about
[1:12:51] not the one that put you on in the grave
[1:12:53] under the dirt but the one that causes
[1:12:55] you to surrender your life the death
[1:12:57] that causes you to hate yourself and
[1:12:59] hate everything you are and you're the
[1:13:01] genetics that you're made of and all the
[1:13:02] habits of your life die to self this is
[1:13:05] the death
[1:13:10] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[1:13:12] God but you're not in the flesh
[1:13:15] I'm not in the flesh
[1:13:19] but you are not in the flesh
[1:13:21] but in the spirit if so be that the
[1:13:24] spirit of God dwell in you so how do I
[1:13:26] get out of the flesh ah when the spirit
[1:13:28] of God dwells in me it'll Quicken this
[1:13:30] Mortal body
[1:13:32] and now I'm Not In the Flesh the old
[1:13:34] Spirit of the flesh the old nature of
[1:13:35] the flesh am I in the flesh I'm in the
[1:13:37] flesh but it's totally different there's
[1:13:39] another Spirit living outside of me not
[1:13:41] the old fleshly spirit
[1:13:46] oh praise God
[1:13:48] now if any man have not the spirit of
[1:13:50] Christ he is none of his
[1:13:52] and if Christ be in you the body is dead
[1:13:58] oh he's not talking about the death
[1:14:00] we're used to he's talking about the
[1:14:01] deaths we really need
[1:14:05] if Christ been you the body is dead
[1:14:07] because of sin but the spirit is life
[1:14:09] because of righteousness but if the
[1:14:10] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:14:12] the dead dwelleth in you he that raised
[1:14:14] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[1:14:16] your mortal bodies by the spirit that
[1:14:18] dwelleth in you so if Christ dwell in
[1:14:20] you you reckon yourself to be dead your
[1:14:22] body is dead there's nothing I can do
[1:14:24] there's no good in me I have no capacity
[1:14:26] but amen if the spirit of him that
[1:14:30] raised Christ from the dead dwell in you
[1:14:32] he will Quicken this Mortal body and now
[1:14:35] the body can come to the life of the
[1:14:37] word
[1:14:40] praise God
[1:14:43] oh
[1:14:46] I love the message
[1:14:50] you know what the message is done
[1:14:53] it has stopped the plotting along
[1:14:55] waiting for something to happen
[1:14:59] someday the Lord will come back someday
[1:15:02] it all someday we'll have a Revival
[1:15:05] someday
[1:15:08] this is the Revival
[1:15:10] someday it'll be a restaurant this is
[1:15:12] the resurrection he says he says there
[1:15:15] is your Resurrection the question is
[1:15:17] have you had a resurrection are you
[1:15:19] resurrected are you quickened is your
[1:15:21] mortal body alive alive not into the
[1:15:23] flesh but alive unto the spirit to live
[1:15:25] out this word there's your Resurrection
[1:15:29] amen not waiting some day something
[1:15:32] glorious is going to happen the Glorious
[1:15:34] thing is happening right now Friends
[1:15:36] when the word is being made alive in
[1:15:38] flesh what flesh Christ flesh
[1:15:45] amen how is this Mortal body going to be
[1:15:49] his flesh he just told us
[1:15:53] praise be the god
[1:15:56] oh
[1:15:58] now I'm going to read the last part of
[1:16:00] this again because I got so excited I
[1:16:01] forgot one of the most exciting parts
[1:16:04] said Therefore your bodies is the Temple
[1:16:06] of the Dynamics we read this because why
[1:16:09] why is your body the temple front the
[1:16:11] Dynamics how is this even possible why
[1:16:14] from the beginning you were part of the
[1:16:15] mechanics if you weren't part of God
[1:16:17] from the beginning and part of the word
[1:16:18] this will never work for you
[1:16:21] but if this works for you it's because
[1:16:23] you were part of the mechanics from the
[1:16:25] beginning so the Dynamics can come on
[1:16:27] the mechanics
[1:16:28] no mechanics no Dynamics
[1:16:32] why from the beginning you're part of
[1:16:34] the mechanics oh there's your
[1:16:37] Resurrection there is the church in the
[1:16:40] resurrection with him these bodies right
[1:16:43] now are quickened amen
[1:16:48] amen oh see you've heard you believe it
[1:16:52] changed you from a denomination to the
[1:16:54] word
[1:16:55] there's the quickening power
[1:16:59] again in Christ is the mystery of God
[1:17:01] revealed he says he is the head of the
[1:17:02] church which is his body and he wants
[1:17:05] the preeminances listen now listen close
[1:17:08] while we're going he is to be the head
[1:17:10] of the body his bride's body
[1:17:14] which is taken from him flesh and Bone
[1:17:17] like in Adam see Bride
[1:17:19] born from the dead
[1:17:25] so he he needs a body that's born from
[1:17:28] the dead
[1:17:31] he needs a bride that's resurrected amen
[1:17:36] amen that's born from the dead
[1:17:40] let's read it again
[1:17:42] born from the Dead Sea that's born from
[1:17:46] the dead sin of unbelief
[1:17:50] what killed Eve unbelief
[1:17:53] is that right their own belief in what
[1:17:54] unbelief in God no she had faith in God
[1:17:57] sure there is she never said there's no
[1:17:59] God no sir she wasn't an Infidel she
[1:18:01] said you know I don't believe his word
[1:18:03] at all no she believed all but one
[1:18:05] little thing
[1:18:07] so what he wants to become the head of
[1:18:10] the body the bride body which was taken
[1:18:12] from him flesh and Bone like an Adam
[1:18:13] born from the dead what born from the
[1:18:17] dead what resurrected from the dead does
[1:18:18] this bride need to be from the death of
[1:18:21] unbelief
[1:18:23] which we were trapped in because of
[1:18:25] denominationalism in man's teaching
[1:18:29] again in crisis and mystery he says
[1:18:31] notice the Vindicated word in his body
[1:18:33] is his victory and the reason of his
[1:18:36] death see the death not in the spirit
[1:18:38] when he died he only died in the flesh
[1:18:40] his Spirit went to hell and preached to
[1:18:42] the souls in prison that's right his
[1:18:44] flesh only died when he raised it up
[1:18:47] again and quickened it Quicken means
[1:18:49] Made Alive his flesh which was his body
[1:18:52] now brother man is not just rehearsing
[1:18:54] something that happened he's going to
[1:18:55] relate it to something that's going on
[1:18:57] in this generation
[1:18:58] he's saying when Jesus died yeah you
[1:19:02] can't kill Jesus Christ you can't kill
[1:19:04] amen what's Immortal amen but you can
[1:19:07] kill the body
[1:19:09] and what was the body the body was the
[1:19:12] word made flesh so he's going to type
[1:19:14] this death of Jesus Christ laying in the
[1:19:17] grave with the death of the word
[1:19:19] this is how he's tying this all together
[1:19:22] he didn't you can't kill the spirit
[1:19:27] his flesh only died when he raised it up
[1:19:29] again and quickened it Quicken means
[1:19:31] made of lime his flesh which was his
[1:19:33] body and that's the word
[1:19:35] we got it we're on the same page
[1:19:39] now he says it's been laying dead for
[1:19:42] years
[1:19:44] but it gradually began to come in the
[1:19:46] reformation and now she's standing on
[1:19:49] her feet amen what body is this it's the
[1:19:52] word what word it's her she is that she
[1:19:57] went into the grave at nicaea she died
[1:19:59] amen the bride tree was withered down by
[1:20:02] the four stages of the insect until it
[1:20:04] got it down to the root it was laying
[1:20:06] there like it's dead brother Branham is
[1:20:08] typing the condition of the church with
[1:20:10] the condition of Jesus after crucifixion
[1:20:12] he laid in the grave
[1:20:15] what not the spirit the word the body
[1:20:19] the word made flesh
[1:20:22] and now he comes and says but it's been
[1:20:25] laying dead now for years
[1:20:30] why because of romanism and
[1:20:31] denominationalism it has killed the
[1:20:34] effect of the word and the people and
[1:20:36] misinterpreted mishandled it and
[1:20:37] withheld it from the people but there's
[1:20:40] going to be a resurrection in the third
[1:20:42] day amen it's coming to the fourth stage
[1:20:44] of Life the word is coming back and now
[1:20:47] she's come back through the Reformation
[1:20:49] what was the Reformation Luther Wesley
[1:20:52] Pentecost and now she's standing on her
[1:20:55] feet
[1:20:56] what is it the resurrection of the word
[1:20:59] which is the resurrection of the body
[1:21:01] which body Christ's body his bride
[1:21:06] what day are we living in we're not in a
[1:21:09] Reformation we're not in a stage of
[1:21:11] coming back this is the resurrection
[1:21:13] this is the rising of the sun this is
[1:21:16] the return of the quickening power to
[1:21:18] Quicken the body to life
[1:21:23] Hallelujah
[1:21:26] now
[1:21:27] she's standing upon her feet
[1:21:31] don't worry look where he goes next
[1:21:34] oh how I wish I had time to go back into
[1:21:36] Ezekiel
[1:21:37] and pull out them dry bones
[1:21:39] and show you he said come can these
[1:21:42] bones live again yes
[1:21:44] he said prophesy
[1:21:47] [Music]
[1:21:49] how can prophecy come only through the
[1:21:52] prophet it's the word of the Lord hear
[1:21:55] ye Dry Bones the word of the Lord and
[1:21:57] sin you escape upon them and they stood
[1:21:59] up a mighty Army and began to March
[1:22:01] towards Zion glory to God that's him
[1:22:03] that's him the victory what is he
[1:22:06] talking about he's talking about the
[1:22:07] resurrection of the church out of the
[1:22:09] death through nicaea through the Dark
[1:22:11] Ages coming back through three stages of
[1:22:13] life amen but if you go back to Ezekiel
[1:22:16] in Ezekiel there was four stages coming
[1:22:18] back there was three that brought her
[1:22:20] back to her feet that brought the Army
[1:22:22] up bone came to Bone send you to send
[1:22:24] you flesh upon flesh and now it's
[1:22:26] standing there but they're not in motion
[1:22:28] yet
[1:22:29] because the word was returned through
[1:22:31] the Reformation Bibles came back brother
[1:22:33] Brandon was there to tie all the loose
[1:22:35] ends together but they needed something
[1:22:37] else it needed a lot of rain it needed a
[1:22:39] third pull it needed about pouring of
[1:22:41] dynamic power
[1:22:48] and it took
[1:22:51] another word of Prophecy Hallelujah
[1:22:54] the fourth stage yes
[1:22:56] breath yes
[1:22:58] wind life spirit
[1:23:02] the quickening power
[1:23:04] came back in and they marched a mighty
[1:23:06] marching Hallelujah
[1:23:11] oh praise God where are we friends
[1:23:16] where are we
[1:23:19] and what effect should it have on us
[1:23:26] it says in Christ and mystery God
[1:23:27] revealed again he says but I'm talking
[1:23:29] about the headship of Christ
[1:23:31] being personally identified by the
[1:23:33] original headship we have the answer to
[1:23:35] the devil's question
[1:23:36] amen glory we have the answer to the
[1:23:38] devil's question he Christ is risen and
[1:23:42] has paid the price and is raising up the
[1:23:45] head and he stops it up or the body
[1:23:49] what's Christ raising up now he's
[1:23:51] raising up the body what body his body
[1:23:57] again he says then he says the bride
[1:23:59] body
[1:24:00] must follow the head
[1:24:03] for it's part of his resurrection
[1:24:06] and part of his mystery amen
[1:24:09] amen what body the bride body what body
[1:24:12] is that
[1:24:13] could that be the part we're part of
[1:24:15] yeah the bride body the true church the
[1:24:18] bride of Christ the body of Christ on
[1:24:20] the earth the many membered body which
[1:24:22] were members of the Bride body must
[1:24:24] follow the head for it's part of his
[1:24:26] resurrection and part of the mystery
[1:24:31] so I titled this she is part of the
[1:24:34] mystery of God
[1:24:35] she's part of the mystery it's
[1:24:38] impossible for it not to go oh my it's
[1:24:40] part of God's mystery
[1:24:45] we say Revelation 10 7.
[1:24:49] she's part
[1:24:50] of the mystery of God
[1:24:53] when we referred to Revelation 10 7 in
[1:24:56] the days of the voice of seventh angel
[1:24:57] the mystery of God should be finished
[1:24:58] listen friends the bride body is part of
[1:25:01] that mystery
[1:25:04] remember because the great plan that he
[1:25:06] had in the back part of his mind it
[1:25:07] unfolded in three folds
[1:25:10] the first was to get preeminence in a
[1:25:12] man he did that in Christ Jesus the
[1:25:13] second is to get preeminence in the
[1:25:15] people
[1:25:16] and third a return back to Eden
[1:25:20] the second party's accomplishing now
[1:25:26] the bride body must follow the head for
[1:25:28] its part of the resurrection and part of
[1:25:30] the mystery
[1:25:31] it's impossible for it not to go oh my
[1:25:33] it's part of God's mystery
[1:25:37] how God revealed himself here and raised
[1:25:39] it up by the word so he Reveals His
[1:25:41] church and raises it up by the same word
[1:25:44] it's part of his threefold mystery
[1:25:48] a few paragraphs down he says I'm trying
[1:25:50] to bring you the threefold Revelation or
[1:25:53] the mystery of God
[1:25:59] we can say she is part of the mystery of
[1:26:02] God
[1:26:04] but the real impact comes when you say
[1:26:06] I'm part
[1:26:10] not by Merit but by God's grace
[1:26:13] not not for any reason that I can tell
[1:26:16] you in myself except he chose before the
[1:26:20] foundation
[1:26:21] but I am part of that mystery and the
[1:26:24] reason I'm on this Earth
[1:26:30] may this revelation
[1:26:32] dictate to us our true purpose
[1:26:36] because the world tries to give us all
[1:26:38] kinds of purpose
[1:26:40] things we need to accomplish things we
[1:26:41] need to do a purpose in life but this is
[1:26:44] our purpose
[1:26:46] and may this Revelation dictate to us
[1:26:48] personally what our purpose is
[1:26:52] again he says not them people
[1:26:54] the headship in the body has become one
[1:26:56] unit it's God manifested in his people
[1:26:59] that's the reason the husband and wife
[1:27:00] is no longer Twain They are one God in
[1:27:03] his church is one Christ in you God's
[1:27:06] Great revelation
[1:27:08] what is God's Great Revelation Christ in
[1:27:11] you
[1:27:12] Christ in you the hope of glory this is
[1:27:15] the great revelation
[1:27:17] glory to God even bearing his name his
[1:27:19] name is Jesus the anointed the reason he
[1:27:21] is called Jesus he is the anointed it's
[1:27:23] the anointed Body of Christ proving
[1:27:26] manifesting God like that body did and
[1:27:28] that body redeemed every one of these
[1:27:30] bodies and and through there God works
[1:27:32] his threefold manifestation going to the
[1:27:35] kingdom
[1:27:36] now we're back in the uh it is the
[1:27:38] rising of the Sun
[1:27:40] he says remember he went there with you
[1:27:42] and him see
[1:27:43] God never separated the bride from the
[1:27:45] groom yet so when God looked down upon
[1:27:48] the body of Christ he saw both male and
[1:27:49] female it was all redeemed in that one
[1:27:52] body
[1:27:53] that's why we don't go to judgment
[1:27:56] this is the reason we do not go to
[1:27:58] condemnation we do not go to judgment
[1:28:00] there's no condemnation to those that
[1:28:02] are in Christ Jesus
[1:28:04] why because I was in Christ Jesus there
[1:28:07] brother REM said he made me pay for my
[1:28:09] sins there
[1:28:13] I you know say your brother Ted
[1:28:15] comprehend that explain that to me I can
[1:28:17] but I believe it friends
[1:28:19] I can't explain that to you but it's the
[1:28:21] truth
[1:28:23] so he says now he says he saw both male
[1:28:26] and female it was all redeemed in that
[1:28:27] one body they are one same same word the
[1:28:30] same word spoke of the groom speaks of
[1:28:32] the Bride
[1:28:34] all of a sudden this changes things
[1:28:39] the same word that speaks of the groom
[1:28:41] speaks of the Bride
[1:28:43] was that true in Adam's day yes
[1:28:46] when God said to Adam multiply and
[1:28:48] replenish the Earth that same word spoke
[1:28:50] to the bride
[1:28:52] when he gave them word and says don't
[1:28:54] don't partake of the tree of knowledge
[1:28:56] of Good and Evil when he says that did
[1:28:58] that also apply to the bride yes sir so
[1:29:00] the word that applies to the groom also
[1:29:02] applies to the bride
[1:29:05] praise God
[1:29:07] now
[1:29:10] this just opened up the whole Bible
[1:29:13] that understanding just opened up the
[1:29:16] whole Bible because now what what verses
[1:29:18] apply to the bride let's find the
[1:29:20] bride's verses you'll find the brides
[1:29:21] verses coupled in the Grooms verses
[1:29:23] because what he spoke of the groom
[1:29:25] speaks of the Bride
[1:29:26] [Music]
[1:29:30] is it the same word spoke of the group
[1:29:32] speaks of the brine well how can the
[1:29:34] Bride come and fail to manifest
[1:29:37] everything was promised of him
[1:29:40] and the groom come
[1:29:43] and he wouldn't be the bride
[1:29:47] I'm going to read that again thank you
[1:29:50] so that it can hit home pay close
[1:29:51] attention
[1:29:53] how can the Bride come and fail to
[1:29:55] manifest everything was promised to him
[1:29:56] why because the scriptures that pertain
[1:29:58] to him pertain to her also The Works
[1:30:01] that I do you'll do also
[1:30:03] right
[1:30:04] so how can the Bride come and not
[1:30:06] manifest everything
[1:30:08] that was promised of him
[1:30:10] and how and the groom come do we believe
[1:30:13] in the coming of the Lord do we believe
[1:30:15] the groom come the bridegroom is
[1:30:16] descended so he says now he's going to
[1:30:19] tell you what to look for and the groom
[1:30:21] come and he wouldn't be the bride
[1:30:25] so when the groom comes what is the
[1:30:27] groom he's the bride where's the groom
[1:30:29] in the bride what form is he in he's in
[1:30:31] the formation of the Bride he's in Bride
[1:30:33] form amen how could the groom come and
[1:30:36] not be the bride
[1:30:38] why because she's a further expression
[1:30:41] of the groom she was in the groom it's
[1:30:43] the groom's body it's the groom's spirit
[1:30:47] how could the groom come
[1:30:50] and he wouldn't be
[1:30:52] the bride
[1:30:54] this is what confuses so many people
[1:30:57] about the coming of the lord they're
[1:30:58] looking for the bridegroom the Mighty
[1:30:59] God the mighty Angels descended where
[1:31:01] did he go where did he go he's descended
[1:31:03] did he go back what are we looking for
[1:31:05] you're looking for the wrong thing when
[1:31:07] he comes how could he not be the bride
[1:31:09] because this is bride time bride
[1:31:10] manifestation this is the time that he
[1:31:13] is expressed in her
[1:31:15] man because she's part of the mystery
[1:31:19] and that part has to be expressed but
[1:31:21] it's got to be him and her
[1:31:24] she can't do it on her own it's got to
[1:31:26] be the same spirit that quickened him
[1:31:28] that's got to Quicken us
[1:31:31] oh I love that
[1:31:34] so let's go back to Genesis chapter 3.
[1:31:37] I just want to grab a couple quick
[1:31:39] scriptures
[1:31:40] and we'll move on because of the same
[1:31:42] scriptures that speak of the groom
[1:31:44] speaks to the bride
[1:31:47] Genesis 3 15.
[1:31:54] all right
[1:31:55] put on your spiritual jackets
[1:31:59] and I would put enmity between thee and
[1:32:01] the woman in between thy seed and her
[1:32:03] seed and thou shall bruise thy head and
[1:32:06] thou shalt bruise his heel
[1:32:09] this is a prophecy of the seed of the
[1:32:11] woman coming this is a prophecy of Jesus
[1:32:13] Christ
[1:32:15] and what will Jesus Christ do he will
[1:32:17] bruise the head of the serpent is that
[1:32:19] right
[1:32:20] and thou shalt bruises heal
[1:32:22] this is a prophecy concerning the
[1:32:25] bridegroom do we all agree
[1:32:28] let's go to Romans 16.
[1:32:38] Romans 16.
[1:32:41] and verse 20.
[1:32:44] Romans 16 20 says in the God of all
[1:32:46] peace shall bruise Satan under your feet
[1:32:49] shortly
[1:32:52] I thought he was going to be bruised
[1:32:55] under Jesus Christ's feet
[1:32:58] I thought Genesis 3 15 was referring to
[1:33:01] Jesus Christ and it was
[1:33:04] but here Paul comes and says and the God
[1:33:07] of all peace shall Bruce Satan under
[1:33:09] your feet whose feet the bride's feet
[1:33:12] the church's feet who's he speaking to
[1:33:14] in Romans he's speaking to the bride
[1:33:16] he's speaking to the church so now the
[1:33:19] scripture that speaks of the groom
[1:33:20] speaks also of the Bride
[1:33:22] [Applause]
[1:33:23] you know brother Branham said he was
[1:33:25] sent to destroy the works of the devil
[1:33:26] his bride is to do the same thing why
[1:33:28] because the scripture that speaks of the
[1:33:30] groom speaks of the Bride the prophecy
[1:33:32] of him bruising the head of the serpent
[1:33:34] amen that applied to Jesus Christ
[1:33:35] absolutely but don't forget the prophet
[1:33:38] said that scripture has manifold
[1:33:40] interpretations and manifolded
[1:33:42] fulfillments
[1:33:44] and absolutely that was a prophecy of
[1:33:47] the seed of the woman which was Jesus
[1:33:48] Christ but Paul picks it up and says no
[1:33:50] there's a continuation going on because
[1:33:53] this is not the end of his body his body
[1:33:56] is still being expressed and he still
[1:33:58] has feet that he can put Satan under
[1:34:04] this is why denominational thinking will
[1:34:06] never work because the denomination says
[1:34:08] there's the prophecy there's the
[1:34:10] Fulfillment it's done but the prophet
[1:34:12] can look because he has the spirit of
[1:34:14] the author that can tell him no it's not
[1:34:16] done amen Paul the Apostle could come
[1:34:18] and say that's not done because God the
[1:34:21] God of all peace shall finish this
[1:34:23] prophecy under your feet
[1:34:29] oh
[1:34:30] I love when there's a prophet on the
[1:34:32] scene
[1:34:33] that can make the word live
[1:34:37] it wasn't for that we would leave it
[1:34:39] stuck there but then what would we do
[1:34:41] with Paul
[1:34:44] oh thank God Almighty
[1:34:47] let's go to John 1 1.
[1:35:07] praise God we're almost done I'll have
[1:35:09] you know I deleted three pages of notes
[1:35:12] right
[1:35:14] before I came
[1:35:16] because I wanted to fit this all in
[1:35:18] today
[1:35:19] I don't want to wear you out but my it's
[1:35:21] becoming so much more alive to me day by
[1:35:24] day hour by hour
[1:35:26] John 1 1 it says in the beginning was
[1:35:28] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:35:31] the Word was God
[1:35:33] the same was in the beginning with God
[1:35:37] who's that scripture referring to
[1:35:41] denominational thinking would say Jesus
[1:35:44] Christ
[1:35:45] and it would be correct
[1:35:48] but how many times brother Branham says
[1:35:50] you're the word
[1:35:51] you're part of the word you're an
[1:35:53] attribute of God you were in his
[1:35:55] thinking you're a thought of God an
[1:35:56] attribute a word of God and so in the
[1:35:59] beginning was the word I don't know
[1:36:02] anything other to do than believe that
[1:36:04] I'm part of the scripture I don't know
[1:36:06] any other way to view it with the
[1:36:08] prophet's message and say I here I am in
[1:36:10] Genesis 1 1 amen I'm here amen because
[1:36:13] something in me was there amen not my
[1:36:17] conscience not my understanding not my
[1:36:18] flesh not my human Spirit that's not
[1:36:20] what I'm talking about but in my soul
[1:36:21] amen there was something that was there
[1:36:23] when it's referring to in the beginning
[1:36:25] was the word if I'm part of the word I
[1:36:27] was there
[1:36:28] if the word was made flesh and nailed to
[1:36:30] a cross brother Benham said if you're
[1:36:32] part of the word you were there that day
[1:36:34] on Calvary the bride was in the body if
[1:36:36] I was there then I have to be there in
[1:36:38] John 1 1. amen
[1:36:41] amen
[1:36:43] amen
[1:36:45] said God help us yeah help us as your
[1:36:48] children to break away from all this
[1:36:50] childish understanding of the scripture
[1:36:52] give us the isab this message to wash
[1:36:55] all the crud out of my eyes so that I
[1:36:57] can read this Bible correctly
[1:37:02] because the scripture that speaks of the
[1:37:04] groom
[1:37:05] speaks also of the Bride
[1:37:09] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:37:10] Word was with God and the Word was gone
[1:37:11] the same was in the beginning with god
[1:37:13] let's go to verse 14 and the Word was
[1:37:16] made Flash and dwelt Among Us
[1:37:19] what should I do with that scripture
[1:37:24] [Applause]
[1:37:26] what should we do with this scripture
[1:37:28] should we leave it parked 2000 years ago
[1:37:31] or should we believe that it also
[1:37:33] applies today amen but the the word is
[1:37:35] being made flesh today right now in the
[1:37:39] flesh of Jesus Christ in his bride body
[1:37:43] [Music]
[1:37:44] amen then the prophet tell us that
[1:37:47] scripture has multiple fulfillments
[1:37:52] here's what he says in the invisible
[1:37:53] Union and Jesus the word took my place
[1:37:56] he became me that a sinner that I might
[1:37:59] become him the word
[1:38:04] you know I think sometimes we hear
[1:38:06] things so many times we it doesn't the
[1:38:08] full impact of the statement escapes us
[1:38:13] he just said God came in in the form of
[1:38:16] Jesus Christ and took your place
[1:38:19] so that you could take his place the
[1:38:21] word
[1:38:23] he was the word and now by his
[1:38:26] Redemption power he's brought you back
[1:38:28] to be the word
[1:38:33] he said amen let me hold true to it not
[1:38:35] the church the word
[1:38:38] oh that spiritual union of Christ in his
[1:38:41] church now
[1:38:43] did you hear the word now
[1:38:45] the spiritual union of Christ the church
[1:38:47] now when the flesh is becoming word and
[1:38:51] the word is becoming flesh manifested
[1:38:54] Vindicated just what the Bible said
[1:38:57] would happen in this day it's happening
[1:38:59] day by day
[1:39:01] now let's go back to John 1 14 and the
[1:39:04] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:39:06] what should I do with that verse amen
[1:39:09] is the same scripture that applies to
[1:39:10] the groom does it apply to the bride
[1:39:13] is the word becoming flesh and the flesh
[1:39:16] becoming the word it's happening friends
[1:39:18] day by day
[1:39:21] let's go to First Timothy 3 16.
[1:39:42] First Timothy 3 16.
[1:39:47] and without controversy great is the
[1:39:49] mystery of godliness
[1:39:51] God was manifest in the flesh is that
[1:39:54] true
[1:39:56] okay
[1:39:57] God was manifested in the flesh Karma
[1:40:00] justified in the spirit so who was
[1:40:02] justified in the spirit God is still
[1:40:04] referring back to God
[1:40:06] we're on the same page so you could read
[1:40:08] it like this God was manifested in the
[1:40:09] flesh God was justified in the spirit
[1:40:11] God was seen of angels God was preaching
[1:40:14] to the Gentiles God was believed on in
[1:40:16] the world and God was received up in the
[1:40:18] glory
[1:40:19] you get that
[1:40:20] how much of that took place in the
[1:40:22] ministry of Jesus Christ in his Earthly
[1:40:25] Ministry
[1:40:26] he was not preached unto the Gentiles
[1:40:28] while he was still on Earth in his
[1:40:30] Corporal body that came through the
[1:40:32] Apostle Paul and the disciples
[1:40:35] but it was who preached unto the god
[1:40:39] it was who believed on in the world
[1:40:41] that's still taking place today friends
[1:40:43] that's God and it's God who will be
[1:40:46] received up in the glory when at the
[1:40:48] Rapture of the church is God who will be
[1:40:50] received up in the glory it's the full
[1:40:52] cycle of God God manifests in the flesh
[1:40:55] God justified in this fear God seeing of
[1:40:58] angels God preached into the Gentiles
[1:41:00] God believed on in the world and God
[1:41:02] received up into Glory
[1:41:04] when I was in denomination I only saw
[1:41:07] Jesus Christ and I left that 2000 but it
[1:41:10] doesn't fit the scripture what fits the
[1:41:12] scripture is the revelation of the hour
[1:41:14] this message makes this Bible Alive
[1:41:18] makes it true amen
[1:41:22] praise be to God
[1:41:24] wash us Lord
[1:41:26] wash us
[1:41:28] from all the wrong teachings
[1:41:36] mystery of God revealed again he says it
[1:41:39] goes right by them and they don't
[1:41:41] recognize it
[1:41:42] until it's gone
[1:41:45] is that the pattern in the Bible
[1:41:49] it only picks up the predestinated seed
[1:41:51] that God predestinated before the
[1:41:52] foundation of the Earth
[1:41:54] the same thing came through in the days
[1:41:55] of Noah the same thing came through in
[1:41:57] the days of Moses Days of Elijah days of
[1:41:58] the prophets days of Jesus on down
[1:42:00] through to this very hour
[1:42:03] the pattern hasn't changed
[1:42:07] they don't recognize it until it's gone
[1:42:10] it goes right by them
[1:42:13] and they don't recognize
[1:42:15] what don't they recognize in this day
[1:42:17] the Grooms come
[1:42:21] and how could the groom come and not be
[1:42:23] the bride
[1:42:30] oh
[1:42:34] they didn't recognize it Noah's day
[1:42:36] Moses they Elijah's day the days of the
[1:42:39] prophets on down through this very hour
[1:42:41] the pregnated person with the seed of
[1:42:43] God
[1:42:45] the word in there manifesting itself so
[1:42:48] surrendered to the will of God that the
[1:42:50] word and the word alone manifest itself
[1:42:52] in this person The Prisoner an
[1:42:54] individual
[1:42:56] that's what's being missed in this day
[1:43:02] you know I
[1:43:03] I was meditating a little bit ago
[1:43:07] and I was thinking of The Parables that
[1:43:09] brother Branham would tell
[1:43:10] I hope it's okay if I call them parables
[1:43:14] but the man would tell stories and a
[1:43:15] Parables a story a man that teaches the
[1:43:17] truth and so brother Brandon was
[1:43:19] teaching by Parables you start to think
[1:43:21] about the the story of the eagle in the
[1:43:24] chicken yard
[1:43:25] we have that story where the eagle the
[1:43:27] farmer took an egg out of an eagle's
[1:43:29] nest and he put it under a hen and it
[1:43:31] hatched out and began to be raised by
[1:43:33] this hen in the chicken yard and the
[1:43:34] eagle thought it was a chicken because
[1:43:36] it was born under a chicken
[1:43:38] tried to act like the chickens didn't
[1:43:40] fit in but one day Mama Eagle knew that
[1:43:43] she had another baby and she went
[1:43:44] hunting that baby and when she flew over
[1:43:46] the Barnyard she saw her baby stuck in
[1:43:48] the barnyard and she let out a scream
[1:43:50] and when she screamed the piercing
[1:43:52] screamed it frightened the chickens and
[1:43:54] they scattered but the eagle looked up
[1:43:56] because something in him connected to
[1:43:58] that screen
[1:44:00] it resonated inside of him and he looked
[1:44:03] up and saw a being with 14 feet wind
[1:44:05] span and amen
[1:44:07] and he said whatever that is that's me
[1:44:10] he reflected himself in that being and
[1:44:13] then he wanted to know what to do and
[1:44:14] and Mama scream come up here son you're
[1:44:16] an eagle and he says how do I get up
[1:44:18] there and she says just flap your wings
[1:44:19] and he got on the post and then he flew
[1:44:21] to the skies we know that story
[1:44:24] brother bam tells it how many times
[1:44:26] I never looked it up dozens and dozens
[1:44:30] at least
[1:44:32] then he tells another story he tells the
[1:44:35] story of the soldier with amnesia
[1:44:38] coming back from the war but he had
[1:44:40] gotten Amnesia from the war and he's on
[1:44:42] a train and the soldiers have to watch
[1:44:44] over him because they can wander off and
[1:44:45] all of a sudden they come to a train
[1:44:47] depot and they stop at a certain stop
[1:44:49] and when he gets out he sees all the all
[1:44:52] the soldiers are getting out and
[1:44:53] stretching their legs and stretching
[1:44:54] their back and walking around and all of
[1:44:56] a sudden the funny look comes over the
[1:44:57] face of this one soldier this soldier's
[1:45:00] got amnesia he doesn't know his name he
[1:45:01] doesn't know his Papa's mama he doesn't
[1:45:03] know he was born he doesn't know who he
[1:45:04] is he's completely lost his identity
[1:45:06] amen but all of a sudden something
[1:45:08] strikes and he begins walking and
[1:45:10] instead of stopping him the guard that
[1:45:11] was watching her and begins to follow
[1:45:13] him and he goes down the road and he
[1:45:15] looks around and he turns her eye and he
[1:45:16] turns left and he goes out of town and
[1:45:18] he finally walks up to this house and in
[1:45:20] the house is that soldier's mama and he
[1:45:23] walked back home because when he got
[1:45:24] back in familiar territory he started
[1:45:26] coming back to himself and he recognized
[1:45:28] who he was and where home was it went
[1:45:30] all the way back to home
[1:45:33] it's another parable
[1:45:35] then there's another Parable tells of
[1:45:38] the duck
[1:45:39] it's very similar to The Eagle he only
[1:45:41] tells it once or twice
[1:45:43] but there's a duck that was hatched out
[1:45:45] with a bunch of chickens thought it was
[1:45:46] a chicken too and it couldn't clock it
[1:45:49] would Quack and he was an odd duck and
[1:45:50] you know never fit in
[1:45:52] and it would wander around the Barnyard
[1:45:54] and it would follow the hen and do all
[1:45:56] the things that chickens do but one day
[1:45:59] the hen wandered down near the pond
[1:46:02] and when it wandered down near the pond
[1:46:04] that duck got a whiff of water and as
[1:46:07] soon as it smelt the water he said that
[1:46:08] duck went to the water as hard as it
[1:46:10] could go amen no matter how much the
[1:46:12] chicken clock to call it back it
[1:46:14] couldn't there was something in it
[1:46:15] attracted to the water and it ran to the
[1:46:18] water and swam
[1:46:19] to the water
[1:46:21] it's another story
[1:46:23] then the other one is one of my
[1:46:25] favorites he tells the story of the
[1:46:27] little boy who grew up in the country
[1:46:29] and he never seen a Looking Glass before
[1:46:31] and he went to his aunt's house in the
[1:46:33] city and and he went to run upstairs
[1:46:35] where she had a big full-length mirror
[1:46:37] and he would ran upstairs and also and
[1:46:38] he stopped because there was another
[1:46:39] little boy in the mirror
[1:46:41] you raised his hand the boy raised his
[1:46:42] hand he scratches his nose the boy
[1:46:44] scratched his nose he waves in the boy
[1:46:45] ring
[1:46:46] and finally he hollered back he said
[1:46:48] Mama it's me
[1:46:50] that's me that's who I am that's what I
[1:46:52] look like that's my identification
[1:46:54] how many times did brother man tell
[1:46:56] these stories
[1:46:58] what do they all relate to they all
[1:47:01] relate to one thing that's finding your
[1:47:03] identity that's knowing who you are that
[1:47:05] you were born in something that's not
[1:47:07] you you were raised in something that's
[1:47:09] not you you've got amnesia through the
[1:47:11] battle you don't know who you are you
[1:47:13] don't know your identity you think
[1:47:14] you're something you think you're a
[1:47:16] chicken you think you're this you don't
[1:47:17] know what you are but when you come in
[1:47:20] contact with the mirror of God's word
[1:47:21] it's supposed to bring you
[1:47:23] identification that whatever this word
[1:47:25] is I am
[1:47:27] what was Brothers Venom's Ministry what
[1:47:30] was he trying to do with these stories
[1:47:31] these stories are all about you finding
[1:47:35] out who you really are amen
[1:47:40] amen how many times did he tell it how
[1:47:42] many times did he labor and how many
[1:47:43] times we talk about how neat it is the
[1:47:45] eagle and the duck and all that's named
[1:47:47] The Boy in the mirror and the whole time
[1:47:48] he's trying to get you to realize amen
[1:47:50] that you're part of this great mystery
[1:47:52] Revelations 10 7 you have something to
[1:47:55] do to fulfill Revelations 10 7 that in
[1:47:58] the beginning was the word you're there
[1:48:00] amen all the way through you're part of
[1:48:02] this mystery of God
[1:48:05] this message wasn't about William
[1:48:07] Branham this message is about Jesus
[1:48:10] Christ and Jesus Christ is to be
[1:48:12] expressed in Bride form in this day
[1:48:18] oh praise God
[1:48:21] Don't Let The Parables go over our heads
[1:48:24] because they're simple stories let it
[1:48:26] awaken something deep in our heart
[1:48:29] when we get back into the familiar
[1:48:31] territory of the word
[1:48:33] when we get the whiff of the water of
[1:48:35] the word amen let us run like a duck
[1:48:38] back to the water let us go like that
[1:48:40] Soldier back to home amen we've been
[1:48:42] stuck in this life and spiritual Amnesia
[1:48:45] we have no identification we've never
[1:48:47] seen ourselves correctly like that
[1:48:49] little boy in the country we didn't know
[1:48:51] really what we looked like amen but this
[1:48:54] word has given us a proper
[1:48:56] identification and when we look at the
[1:48:58] word can you holler out Mama it's me
[1:49:01] it's me this word is me I'm part of it I
[1:49:04] was part of it before the foundation of
[1:49:06] the word when it was a thought I was
[1:49:08] part of it when it was a word I was
[1:49:10] thought of it when it was logos I was
[1:49:12] part of it
[1:49:15] amen right
[1:49:16] that's what the message came to do
[1:49:18] friends it's the eyes have so that we
[1:49:21] can see
[1:49:24] amen that's why I get so hurt
[1:49:27] When I See This truth withheld
[1:49:29] minimalize downplay and we go back to
[1:49:33] denomination and go back to other things
[1:49:35] that's not what this message came for
[1:49:37] this message came to awaken a bride amen
[1:49:39] he says they haven't recognized The
[1:49:40] Awakening of the Bride what is it it's
[1:49:42] the latter rain it's the third pool it's
[1:49:44] the opening of the seals what is that
[1:49:46] it's the Awakening of the Bride it's the
[1:49:48] breaking of spiritual Amnesia it's the
[1:49:50] eagle Scream It's the whiff of water
[1:49:52] it's the familiar territory
[1:49:55] to do what to bring us back home
[1:50:01] it's why when we do different things
[1:50:03] with the message and fulfill our own
[1:50:04] agendas and create our own doctrines and
[1:50:07] have our own movement it's all an
[1:50:09] absolute travesty
[1:50:13] because it came
[1:50:15] to open our eyes
[1:50:18] to look into the word
[1:50:21] and for Spiritual Amnesia to break away
[1:50:24] and say it's me mama
[1:50:27] that's me
[1:50:29] I now know who I am
[1:50:31] I now know where I came from and I now
[1:50:34] know where I'm going
[1:50:35] I now know what my purpose is now my
[1:50:38] mysterious misunderstood life
[1:50:42] why I felt the way I felt and why I've
[1:50:44] had trouble the way I have trouble and
[1:50:46] all the things that God has done to move
[1:50:48] me now it all makes sense to me I
[1:50:50] understand
[1:50:51] I'm part of him
[1:50:57] he says in the Easter seal what is the
[1:50:59] messiah
[1:51:00] what is the messiah messiah is the
[1:51:02] anointed one
[1:51:04] now if he was the Messiah by being the
[1:51:06] anointed one for that day to fulfill the
[1:51:08] word of God to be the Redeemer and the
[1:51:10] anointed when and God raised up that
[1:51:11] body his bride is the anointed one for
[1:51:15] this day
[1:51:19] you know why I read quotes
[1:51:22] because I can't say that
[1:51:25] but a prophet of God just made the bride
[1:51:27] Christ amen the Christ of this day
[1:51:31] that's what the anointed one is Christ
[1:51:33] means the anointed one
[1:51:35] you see he was the anointed one of that
[1:51:37] day his bride is the anointed one for
[1:51:40] this day she is the Christ for this day
[1:51:44] not a replacement
[1:51:46] a further
[1:51:48] manifestation
[1:51:50] same thing the woman was to Adam it's
[1:51:52] the same thing as bride is to Christ
[1:51:57] he goes this bride is the anointing one
[1:51:59] for this day it's already raised with
[1:52:01] him in the resurrection because these
[1:52:04] two are one
[1:52:06] choosing of a bride he says the other is
[1:52:08] pregnated by the word of God and will
[1:52:10] bring forth the body
[1:52:12] the finished body of Jesus Christ which
[1:52:15] is the bride
[1:52:17] we've been impregnated for what
[1:52:21] remember we talked last week about being
[1:52:22] made young going back to a virgin
[1:52:24] condition but we went back to a virgin
[1:52:26] condition so we could conceive seed
[1:52:27] that's what they failed to do
[1:52:30] but we conceive seed of what seed of the
[1:52:32] word to do what to reproduce the word
[1:52:34] what kind of word he tells us right here
[1:52:36] amen the word of God will bring forth
[1:52:39] the body
[1:52:40] let's start at the beginning the other
[1:52:42] is pregnant he's talking about their
[1:52:44] true church the other is pregnated by
[1:52:46] the word of God
[1:52:48] and will bring forth the body
[1:52:50] the finished body of Jesus Christ which
[1:52:54] is the bride
[1:52:56] do you know what the woman was in the
[1:52:57] Garden of Eden she was the finished body
[1:52:59] of Adam
[1:53:01] because Adam couldn't reproduce himself
[1:53:03] without the finished body
[1:53:04] so he's given a bride to reproduce
[1:53:06] himself because he couldn't do it
[1:53:07] without the finishing of his body
[1:53:10] and the bridegroom tree without the
[1:53:12] bride tree don't produce fruit
[1:53:14] so what does he need he needs the
[1:53:16] restoration of the Bride tree so he can
[1:53:17] produce the fruit which is the Life of
[1:53:19] Christ in the bride tree bride form
[1:53:24] amen really it's so simple
[1:53:26] it's so he tells us restoration of the
[1:53:28] Bride tree ego I mean he tells us all of
[1:53:31] these examples he tells us
[1:53:34] it's not that it's not simple it's
[1:53:36] simple to understand
[1:53:38] what's complex is how can it be me
[1:53:42] that's where the complexity enters in
[1:53:45] the self-doubt and the questionings and
[1:53:48] but I say throw that all the way forget
[1:53:51] what your head says and dive down into
[1:53:53] your soul is there something there
[1:53:55] that's screaming out it's me it's me
[1:53:57] that scream whatever it is it sounds
[1:54:00] different than anything I've ever heard
[1:54:01] before but something inside of me says I
[1:54:03] like it it resonates I don't understand
[1:54:06] it I've never heard it before but
[1:54:08] something in me is attracted to that
[1:54:10] screen
[1:54:15] bringing forth the body the finished
[1:54:17] body of Jesus Christ which is the bride
[1:54:19] the body of Christ isn't finished yet
[1:54:21] how many knows that a man and a woman is
[1:54:24] one and Christ is one body the word the
[1:54:27] bride will have to be the rest of that
[1:54:30] body
[1:54:32] the two together make the one body again
[1:54:35] like Adam was at the beginning man and
[1:54:38] his wife are one
[1:54:44] God is so good friends
[1:54:51] brother ma'am in future home
[1:54:53] he says now you say well look at the
[1:54:56] priest wasn't he a son of God
[1:54:58] it proved he wasn't
[1:55:01] he couldn't recognize what did he say I
[1:55:04] believe the Bible sure but he couldn't
[1:55:06] recognize the expressed word of the hour
[1:55:12] he only had an intellectual learning
[1:55:14] from some group that he had packed that
[1:55:16] had been back before him
[1:55:18] and it's the same thing today I know
[1:55:20] that's strong but it's the truth
[1:55:23] there was the word as spoken exactly for
[1:55:25] that day and and he yet he was a scholar
[1:55:28] yet he was a renowned person but he
[1:55:31] could not recognize it why no matter how
[1:55:34] scholar he was anything like that he
[1:55:36] still didn't have representation of
[1:55:39] predestination
[1:55:40] only the predestinated
[1:55:43] will only be the one who does it only
[1:55:46] can be
[1:55:47] and you can only do it because look it
[1:55:50] proves predestination because if you've
[1:55:51] got eternal life you had to be part of
[1:55:53] God all times because he's the only one
[1:55:56] is eternal
[1:56:00] what could that priest not recognize he
[1:56:03] could recognize the law of Moses he
[1:56:04] could recognize the Ten Commandments he
[1:56:06] could recognize Temple worship
[1:56:08] is that true
[1:56:10] he could recognize all the word that
[1:56:12] went before him but he recognized it on
[1:56:15] an intellectual learning level
[1:56:17] not on a revelation level because if he
[1:56:19] understood it on a revelation level when
[1:56:21] the manifestation of the Revelation came
[1:56:24] before his eyes he would recognize these
[1:56:25] two are the same
[1:56:27] but to him they were very different
[1:56:29] things
[1:56:32] say God help us
[1:56:34] that the manifestation of the Revelation
[1:56:36] in this hour will match a revelation we
[1:56:38] have in the scripture and they won't
[1:56:40] look like two different things to us
[1:56:43] that the scriptures and this revelation
[1:56:45] of the Bride coming of Christ don't look
[1:56:47] like two separate events
[1:56:49] but may God give us ice out to where
[1:56:51] they come together and we can see him as
[1:56:53] the same thing
[1:56:55] this is the manifestation of the
[1:56:57] Revelation the mystery that was hidden
[1:57:00] in Christ
[1:57:01] all that God was he poured in Christ
[1:57:03] all that Christ was
[1:57:06] born in the church
[1:57:10] so where is he
[1:57:12] he's in Bride form
[1:57:14] the headship is returned to the body
[1:57:17] and has been pregnated by the word for
[1:57:20] this hour and is manifesting what the
[1:57:23] finished body of Jesus Christ
[1:57:27] to finish the body you have to have all
[1:57:29] the members
[1:57:30] then all the members have to come
[1:57:31] attached to the headship so the headship
[1:57:33] can control every member
[1:57:34] and that'll finish his body
[1:57:39] praise God
[1:57:44] now I just want to look at one more
[1:57:46] thing as we wind down
[1:57:48] let's go to Ephesians chapter 4.
[1:58:07] Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11.
[1:58:12] Ephesians 4 and 11.
[1:58:15] and he gave some Apostles and some
[1:58:17] prophets and some evangelists some
[1:58:19] pastors and teachers
[1:58:21] for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:58:23] for the work of the ministry for the
[1:58:25] edifying of the body of Christ
[1:58:27] what did he give Ministry gifts for
[1:58:30] the perfecting of the saints that word
[1:58:32] perfecting
[1:58:33] we've mentioned it before but it doesn't
[1:58:35] mean flawlessness
[1:58:37] it means full maturity or completion
[1:58:41] for the maturing of the Saints or the
[1:58:43] completion of the Saints for the work of
[1:58:44] the ministry for the edifying that means
[1:58:47] building
[1:58:48] of the body of Christ
[1:58:50] what's the minister supposed to do build
[1:58:51] the body of Christ
[1:58:53] help the saints come to completion to
[1:58:56] maturity
[1:58:57] in verse 13 till we all come in the
[1:58:59] unity of faith and of the knowledge of
[1:59:01] the Son of God unto a perfect man unto
[1:59:04] the measure of the stature of the
[1:59:07] fullness of Christ
[1:59:09] what are we supposed to be doing
[1:59:12] we're supposed to be bringing about the
[1:59:16] fullness of Christ
[1:59:18] where in the church
[1:59:21] in the people
[1:59:23] that's what we're here for
[1:59:26] Amy Amen brother Ben says in Christ The
[1:59:28] Mystery of God reveal now there is only
[1:59:30] one thing can happen there has to be a
[1:59:32] message at the end time when there's
[1:59:34] nothing else can follow him and now the
[1:59:36] ecumenical world has set up such a
[1:59:37] regime there can be no denomination no
[1:59:39] nothing else follow him you're either in
[1:59:42] it or you're not in it the fruit is in
[1:59:44] the top of the tree and the light is
[1:59:46] shining on that predestinated fruit and
[1:59:49] she is ripening into christ-like Fruit
[1:59:51] bringing forth the same mellowness and
[1:59:54] sweetness and the same spirit that he
[1:59:56] had in him
[1:59:59] what are we doing now
[2:00:01] hey the bridegroom tree and the bride
[2:00:04] tree have United
[2:00:07] are there individuals who still need to
[2:00:09] unite yes I believe that but the
[2:00:10] bridegroom tree in the bride tree of
[2:00:12] United
[2:00:13] the Sun is up
[2:00:15] amen do we believe that
[2:00:17] and the light is shining on the top and
[2:00:19] the fruit is ripening what are we doing
[2:00:22] we're in a ripening face coming to
[2:00:25] completion
[2:00:28] that means we should still be growing
[2:00:31] and christ-like
[2:00:34] sweetness and mellowness with the same
[2:00:36] spirit that he had in him
[2:00:39] he goes on to say it this way
[2:00:42] in the message Christ is revealed in his
[2:00:44] own word the thing that's the matter
[2:00:46] with the message today is those who
[2:00:47] obtain in their hearts must lay in the
[2:00:49] presence of the sun to get ripened you
[2:00:52] can pick up the message and then let the
[2:00:54] sun bake all the greenness out of you
[2:00:56] see making matured Christians see what I
[2:00:59] mean God is coming soon to receive his
[2:01:01] church and we must have that type of
[2:01:03] Christian for him to receive the wheat
[2:01:05] has got to get ripe
[2:01:07] so he talks about the bride true and the
[2:01:10] free fruit at the top and the light then
[2:01:12] he talks about the hot augustand the
[2:01:15] rising of the Sun the the full power of
[2:01:17] the sun here to ripen the wheat bring to
[2:01:20] maturity they both are telling the same
[2:01:22] story two different parables
[2:01:25] then he goes and Christ is the mystery
[2:01:28] of God revealed he says now he's
[2:01:29] Sanctified with the spirit and blood of
[2:01:30] church that he might make every promise
[2:01:32] in this last day be revealed now see he
[2:01:34] could go back and pick up what those
[2:01:36] other fellows has left off in the last
[2:01:38] days and by his holy spirit reveal all
[2:01:40] the mysteries of the Seven Seals see
[2:01:43] he's expressing himself that's his
[2:01:45] purpose that's why he died that's the
[2:01:47] second fold of his threefold
[2:01:48] manifestation first to express himself
[2:01:51] in Christ then Express itself through
[2:01:53] the church and the same thing Christ was
[2:01:56] the word and the church becomes the word
[2:01:58] when it lets the word go through them
[2:02:02] so how are we becoming the word by
[2:02:05] surrendering to the word and letting the
[2:02:08] word go through us
[2:02:12] an identification of Christ in all ages
[2:02:14] he says this heavenly father we are
[2:02:17] grateful to see the Risen Messiah 1900
[2:02:19] years of all kinds of Theology and
[2:02:21] movements but still
[2:02:23] in the darkness of all of it you
[2:02:25] promised that you would he appear here
[2:02:27] in the last days in this Sodom day and
[2:02:29] you would make yourself known to the
[2:02:31] children of Abraham the called the
[2:02:33] elected and here you are tonight after
[2:02:35] 1900 years you're just as much alive
[2:02:38] tonight as you was when you walk talk to
[2:02:40] the woman at the well it's God
[2:02:43] manifested in flesh now in the flesh of
[2:02:46] his bride for the bride and the husband
[2:02:49] is the same self flesh
[2:02:55] these two are one and the church I want
[2:02:58] you to hear this now and the church is
[2:03:00] becoming the bride all the time by
[2:03:03] believing the word so that the word in
[2:03:05] the church becomes the same
[2:03:07] the word in the church making it the
[2:03:09] bride the last sign
[2:03:13] God identifying himself the word in the
[2:03:17] church
[2:03:19] these last several examples is what I
[2:03:22] want us to take home with us that God
[2:03:24] through these Parables he tried to break
[2:03:26] the Amnesia open our eyes get us to have
[2:03:28] an identity to know who we really are to
[2:03:31] break us away from a false identity and
[2:03:33] bring us to a true I didn't
[2:03:35] to restore us back to who we were before
[2:03:37] Amnesia kingdom yes
[2:03:40] but then he begins to explain in
[2:03:41] different ways what we should be doing
[2:03:43] now
[2:03:45] now the grain
[2:03:47] the shuck is pulling away
[2:03:50] what does the grain need to do lay in
[2:03:52] the presence of this word
[2:03:54] amen and bake all the immaturity out
[2:03:56] till we become mature Christians
[2:03:59] what does the bride tree need to do the
[2:04:00] fruit needs to stay in the top of the
[2:04:02] tree and let the light of the word bring
[2:04:05] the full maturity of the fruit to the
[2:04:08] same sweetness and melowness that Christ
[2:04:10] had
[2:04:11] how do we become the word we become the
[2:04:14] word by letting the word you know what
[2:04:16] we're the word but we're still becoming
[2:04:18] the word
[2:04:20] amen the bride is the word but on an
[2:04:22] individual level we are still maturing
[2:04:24] the variety as a whole is still maturing
[2:04:26] we're still becoming the word by letting
[2:04:28] the word flow through us
[2:04:32] amen and the church is becoming the
[2:04:34] bride all the time
[2:04:36] by believing the word
[2:04:40] and the word in the church becomes the
[2:04:42] same
[2:04:43] what am I doing why am I coming to
[2:04:45] church why are we doing all this because
[2:04:46] we're still baking we're still ripening
[2:04:51] we're still becoming the word word by
[2:04:53] word
[2:04:54] how does the bride go up word by word
[2:04:58] that's why we come back to hear a sermon
[2:05:01] again come back to have things exposed
[2:05:03] in our lives come back to have truths re
[2:05:05] reaffirm to us so that we can surrender
[2:05:08] a little more and lay ourselves down a
[2:05:10] little more and lay in the presence of
[2:05:11] the word a little more
[2:05:13] until we become
[2:05:15] in the stature of a perfect man
[2:05:18] can we all come into Christ the head
[2:05:22] which is Christ
[2:05:24] God bless you let's all stand
[2:05:26] let's all stand
[2:05:29] this message is my life amen
[2:05:33] amen without it
[2:05:35] where would we be
[2:05:37] without this Revelation without this
[2:05:39] understanding where would we be what
[2:05:41] confusion will be stuck in what effort
[2:05:43] would be putting forth what what kind of
[2:05:46] Christian life would be trying to live
[2:05:48] right how depressed how tired how
[2:05:50] exhausted how legalistic how liberal how
[2:05:54] how lost how what would we be
[2:05:58] oh I thank God
[2:06:01] amen I pray God will help us keep it
[2:06:02] pure keep it right keep it true to what
[2:06:05] the prophet brought
[2:06:07] I'm just praying daily that God will
[2:06:10] wash every other understanding out of me
[2:06:13] yes and let me have the true revelation
[2:06:16] of the word
[2:06:19] Matthew 5 14 says
[2:06:21] ye are
[2:06:23] the light of the world
[2:06:26] I known that statement since I was a
[2:06:27] little boy that was probably one of my
[2:06:29] Sunday school verses
[2:06:32] and I would quote it you are the light
[2:06:33] of the world a city said on the hill
[2:06:34] cannot be hid I probably quoted it and
[2:06:37] got a sticker for it
[2:06:40] but not even the impact of what Jesus is
[2:06:43] saying
[2:06:44] because if you go back to John 1 1.
[2:06:47] John 1 1 says in the beginning was the
[2:06:49] word the word was with God and the Word
[2:06:51] was God
[2:06:52] in him was life and that life was the
[2:06:56] light of men
[2:06:57] and John 1 1 is all about the light
[2:07:00] which is the word which is Christ coming
[2:07:02] into the world into the darkness and the
[2:07:05] Darkness not perceiving it but he was
[2:07:07] that life and as many as would receive
[2:07:09] and would receive the light of life amen
[2:07:11] so Jesus Christ the word is the light
[2:07:13] and he's standing up and he says I am
[2:07:16] the light of the world he may come to me
[2:07:18] shall not abide in darkness he was the
[2:07:21] line but now he's looking at his
[2:07:22] disciples saying ye are the light of the
[2:07:24] world what's he doing he's putting them
[2:07:26] right back in John chapter one
[2:07:29] yeah right
[2:07:31] right it's a Sunday school verse I
[2:07:33] memorized it I read it it was neat
[2:07:35] you're the light of the world we're all
[2:07:37] a light shine the light what light what
[2:07:40] light are we are we a man-made light an
[2:07:42] incandescent bulb what kind of light
[2:07:44] it's got to be original light which is
[2:07:47] the word which contains the thought
[2:07:48] which goes all the way back to the mind
[2:07:50] of God it was expressed as the word and
[2:07:52] as John 1 and he took the disciples and
[2:07:54] put them right back with him
[2:07:57] before the beginning
[2:08:03] are you the light of the world
[2:08:07] what light what kind of light is it true
[2:08:12] light is it the life that's the light of
[2:08:14] men is it the light that comes from the
[2:08:16] word is it the illumination of the
[2:08:17] mystery that was in the back part of
[2:08:19] God's mind the True Light that was to
[2:08:21] come and Shine the Light to dispel all
[2:08:23] of the myths that's been down through
[2:08:25] thousands of years it is the light and
[2:08:28] you are that light and you're to shine
[2:08:29] that light
[2:08:31] this isn't a secondary light this isn't
[2:08:33] a man-made life this is part of the
[2:08:35] original light
[2:08:38] you see how the simplest of scriptures
[2:08:40] has opened wide open in this message
[2:08:44] yeah
[2:08:46] the Bible says
[2:08:48] we look through a glass Darkly
[2:08:53] see we know in part we prophesy in part
[2:08:56] but when that which is perfect has come
[2:08:59] true brother comes to that scripture he
[2:09:01] says and we do by God's grace have today
[2:09:03] the perfect interpretation of where with
[2:09:05] Divine vindication
[2:09:07] he took it right to that scripture and
[2:09:10] then Paul goes on
[2:09:12] and he says but we look through a glass
[2:09:14] Darkness
[2:09:15] but then when when that which is perfect
[2:09:18] amen
[2:09:20] then we will see face to face
[2:09:24] this Bible is a mirror
[2:09:26] brother Branham taught it
[2:09:28] the nominations teaching I heard it when
[2:09:31] I was a boy
[2:09:33] but if the mirror is dark
[2:09:36] clouded obscure opaque
[2:09:39] you don't really and what always struck
[2:09:42] me with this I know I've taught it
[2:09:43] before but I can't help it right yes
[2:09:46] when you look at a mirror what do you
[2:09:49] see
[2:09:53] I mean I just love the scripture
[2:09:56] when you look at a mirror you're looking
[2:09:59] for yourself
[2:10:01] if you look in a mirror Darkly you can't
[2:10:04] clearly see yourself
[2:10:07] but when that which is perfect has come
[2:10:11] back now we see their glasses but then
[2:10:14] we will see us face to face we will see
[2:10:16] who we really are
[2:10:19] ye are the light of the world it's not a
[2:10:21] memory verse it's a reality it didn't
[2:10:24] start when you were born it didn't start
[2:10:26] when you heard the message it started
[2:10:27] when you were in the mind of God before
[2:10:29] the foundation of the world that's when
[2:10:31] that verse started for you you are the
[2:10:33] light of the word because you are the
[2:10:35] word and the word is the life and the
[2:10:37] light of man
[2:10:39] that's why the bride has the power to
[2:10:42] impart life because she has the word
[2:10:44] that brings life
[2:10:48] you are the light of the world
[2:10:50] amen
[2:10:52] we're just going to stop praise God
[2:10:55] let's just sing something I gotta stop
[2:10:57] let's see amen sing something will o
[2:11:01] glorious
