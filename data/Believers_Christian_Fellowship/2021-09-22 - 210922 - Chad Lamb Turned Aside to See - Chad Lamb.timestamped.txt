[11:56] oh heavenly father we thank you lord
[11:59] just for the privilege lord to be able
[12:01] to stand together and sing
[12:04] god singing with revelation and
[12:06] understanding of what you've done in
[12:07] this day
[12:09] what you've done for us lord and how
[12:10] you've lifted us up and you've given us
[12:13] i said to see lord you've anointed us
[12:16] you've clothed us lord you've washed us
[12:19] in your word
[12:20] you've called us your bride and how
[12:21] grateful we are to you lord it's such a
[12:24] privilege to sing back praises to your
[12:26] name
[12:27] god thank you for that privilege
[12:30] now as we come lord to read your word we
[12:32] just ask god that you would take control
[12:34] that you would speak through these lips
[12:35] of clay that all that would be said
[12:37] would be truth and everything we would
[12:38] share lord would be your words lord that
[12:41] you would break the bread of life and
[12:42] that you would feed your sheep may we
[12:44] give you preeminence and make way for
[12:46] you to move freely lord in every heart
[12:48] and every life
[12:49] changes lord by the word lift us up lord
[12:52] by your word
[12:53] open our eyes lord by your word and

[12:57] all that you've called us to be in this
[12:59] day
[13:00] for we love you lord we give you first
[13:02] place
[13:03] in jesus christ's name amen
[13:07] while you're standing let's look at the
[13:09] bible in the book of acts i want to read
[13:11] one scripture
[13:13] acts chapter
[13:15] 7.
[13:20] chapter 7
[13:22] and i just want to read one verse i
[13:24] would like to read verse 30 together
[13:26] before you're seated acts chapter 7
[13:28] verse 30.
[13:31] and when 40 years were expired there
[13:33] appeared to him in the wilderness of
[13:35] mount sinai an angel of the lord and the
[13:38] flame of fire
[13:40] in a bush
[13:41] you could have your seats amen
[13:45] amen i got
[13:47] uh a little bit of a different service
[13:49] for me
[13:50] and this is uh god leads in strange ways
[13:53] god is god and he can do what he wants
[13:55] amen
[13:56] and we found that he's not always
[13:58] predictable and we can't make him do
[14:00] what we want him to do but god has led
[14:03] me in a way that's uncomfortable for me
[14:05] because he's given me a little thought
[14:06] like one scripture and one quote and
[14:09] he's saying go have fun with that and
[14:11] that's not my nature i like i like it
[14:13] all like i like all the nuts and the
[14:15] bolts and the tiny details and i like it
[14:18] i like it fixed and i like it firm and i
[14:20] like it solid and i like it sure
[14:22] and i feel like he's asking me to step
[14:24] out of the boat and walk on the water by
[14:26] inspiration i'm saying god you've got to
[14:28] help me you've got to make that water
[14:30] solid amen so just pray for me
[14:33] and i just want to give you a little
[14:34] update here in a little testimony
[14:37] mom's surgery went really well so we
[14:38] appreciate you praying for her she's
[14:40] recovering really nicely and some of the
[14:42] sisters here made her food and took it
[14:44] down on sunday and she appreciated that
[14:46] so much it meant a lot to her so we're
[14:48] thankful for that
[14:50] i also want to update you on the service
[14:52] we had last sunday with the yoder family
[14:54] we had a wonderful service it was very
[14:57] nice in their home
[14:59] in the first really the first church
[15:01] service since they
[15:03] were set free and broke out of their
[15:05] denomination and it was just such a
[15:07] sweet atmosphere it was such a blessing
[15:09] to be there with them and god really
[15:11] blessed it and so
[15:14] we've talked to them and we've decided
[15:16] that they would like to have regular
[15:17] services in their home at least for now
[15:20] for a while so the third sunday of every
[15:23] month we're going to have an evening

[15:44] really love for more to come from the
[15:46] church and they really want to see you

[15:49] and so we're going to accommodate that
[15:51] so if you would like to go and you'd
[15:54] like to be included there's a sign up

[16:50] and keep praying for them there's a lot
[16:52] happening they had some visitors there
[16:54] that they had been witnessing to that
[16:55] were there levi's brother was there and
[16:58] we were preaching you know we were
[16:59] preaching on samson and samson's lock's
[17:01] growing back and the word coming back at
[17:04] the end of the church ages and i looked
[17:06] over at levi's brother and levi's
[17:07] brothers just he's grinning from ear to
[17:10] ear just hearing the word
[17:11] and i thought praise god you know to
[17:14] react that way not suspicious not stern
[17:17] but hearing the word and enjoying it
[17:19] amen and it feeding into a soul so i it
[17:22] was real blessing and
[17:24] you know we had a chance to pray for the
[17:25] few of those who were sick while they
[17:27] were there and so we're just expecting
[17:29] god to do something for them amen
[17:33] so keep praying for that
[17:34] also
[17:36] this weekend we'll be heading to oregon
[17:37] my family and i for the camp meetings
[17:40] for brother rich cobb so please be in
[17:42] prayer for those meetings and for us
[17:44] traveling this is a really busy time i
[17:47] was i was thinking back when brother
[17:49] rich called me and we make these plans
[17:51] it seemed like such a good idea at the
[17:53] time you know we had nothing planned for
[17:56] this period of time we had a good block
[17:57] set aside then all of a sudden
[17:59] everything piled in mom's surgery
[18:02] levi and his family getting shunned
[18:04] needing services there brother john
[18:06] matthews passing away his funeral and
[18:08] now i'm staggering on my feet thinking
[18:10] what i was thinking what have i done
[18:12] what have i committed to
[18:14] but you know i had to go back to the way
[18:16] i felt at the time that god i felt
[18:19] comfortable with accepting the imitation
[18:20] i felt like it was the leading of the
[18:22] lord so i just want to share with you a
[18:23] testimony i was feeling overwhelmed by
[18:26] this and i don't like being busy and i
[18:27] don't like being away from the church
[18:29] and i don't like having a lot of other
[18:31] ministers minister uh on a uh and you
[18:34] know not be here not preaching not being
[18:35] my post of duty and so i was i was
[18:38] thinking about all that and i got a
[18:40] phone call monday morning and it was
[18:42] from brother abraham myra
[18:44] and brother abraham had been contacted
[18:46] by a sister
[18:48] in california who's originally from
[18:51] africa somewhere and she had heard his
[18:53] testimony and in this testimony he was
[18:55] describing a certain sort of demonic
[18:58] oppression that they fight with over in
[19:00] africa and she had fought with that all
[19:03] of her life
[19:04] and and she didn't know what it was and
[19:07] didn't know the name of it and didn't
[19:08] know and brother abraham was talking
[19:10] about praying for people and them
[19:11] getting delivered of that
[19:13] and so she she has i believe some sort
[19:16] of pentecostal background she doesn't
[19:17] know about the message she just heard it
[19:19] through brother abraham's testimony so
[19:21] somehow she got his number i don't even
[19:24] know how she got his number but she got
[19:26] his email and got contact and they
[19:28] contacted one another and brother
[19:30] abraham talked to her and he told her he
[19:31] said he told her about the message he
[19:33] told her
[19:34] some more of his testimony and he said
[19:36] i've never been able to see i've never
[19:38] seen anybody get delivered from this
[19:40] oppression until they've been baptized
[19:42] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[19:43] prayed for
[19:45] and she says i want to be baptized in
[19:46] jesus name
[19:48] so he called me and asked he says you
[19:51] know can you baptize her i said
[19:54] sure
[19:55] she's in california and she was willing
[19:57] to come she was willing to come here
[19:59] and all of a sudden i realized this
[20:01] weekend i'm going to oregon
[20:04] and i called her up and she says yes i
[20:06] can come to oregon and so she plans on
[20:08] being at the meetings
[20:10] i just she just called me before she's
[20:11] coming around back she's planning on
[20:13] being there
[20:14] and and i called her yesterday and
[20:16] talked to her and i spoke to her about
[20:17] 30 minutes about brother benjamin's
[20:19] ministry the prophecy of the end time
[20:21] the restoration of the word coming back
[20:23] to the church and she loved it she says
[20:26] i've always wondered why the church
[20:28] doesn't have any more power in it
[20:29] anymore like it used to and i've always
[20:32] looked for a bible study where i can
[20:33] study the bible because i read and read
[20:36] and i don't seem to get anything out of
[20:37] it and i said i've got a book for you
[20:41] and i'm going to bring it to you i was
[20:43] going to mail it to her but i'll see her
[20:44] faster than the mail will work i'm going
[20:46] to take her the seven church ages and
[20:48] she's hungry for the word and the more i
[20:50] told her about the message the more she
[20:52] said praise god praise god praise god
[20:56] so god is good and i am greatly
[20:59] encouraged i needed that little boost of
[21:01] encouragement to be able to go on and do
[21:03] what i believe the lord's leading me to
[21:05] do so if you could be praying for us we
[21:07] need some strength we'd appreciate it
[21:09] and also the brothers who are going to
[21:11] step in and help here i really
[21:12] appreciate them and i appreciate you
[21:14] standing behind them brother ben's going
[21:15] to preach for us on sunday and then
[21:17] brother kyle is going to preach again on
[21:19] wednesday so just hold those brothers up
[21:21] in prayer they're a great help to me and
[21:23] i appreciate that and just stand behind
[21:25] them we pray that god will keep feeding
[21:27] the sheep
[21:28] and when i get back i am not going to
[21:30] plan anything
[21:33] for a long long time
[21:35] and so we can just have church together
[21:37] and enjoy one another
[21:39] and maybe rest a little bit
[21:41] anyhow
[21:43] i want to look back at this scripture
[21:46] if you can look at this with me and then
[21:48] we're going to turn to exodus
[21:51] like i said this was a little bit this
[21:52] was an inspiration that came and i
[21:54] couldn't get away from it and we'll just
[21:57] see how it goes i just got some things
[21:58] on my heart i want to share
[22:00] and and here in verse 30 it talks about
[22:03] and 40 years were expired
[22:06] there appeared to him in the wilderness
[22:07] of mount sinai an angel of the lord in a
[22:09] flame of fire and a bush so there was a
[22:12] certain period of time and when that
[22:14] time had expired
[22:16] now
[22:17] god when he was going to call moses and
[22:19] send moses back to finish his commission
[22:22] to fulfill what he was born for the
[22:24] purpose that he was born for
[22:26] god sent an angel to the lord then
[22:28] appeared in the form of an angel order a
[22:30] pillar of fire in the bush that was
[22:33] burning to send moses back and i want to
[22:36] read that in exodus chapter 3 if we
[22:38] could all turn there together exodus
[22:40] chapter 3
[22:47] exodus chapter 3
[22:52] and verse 1
[22:53] [Music]
[22:58] now moses kept the flock of drethro his
[23:01] father-in-law the priest of midian and
[23:03] he led the flock to the backside of the
[23:05] desert and came to the mountain of god
[23:07] even to horeb
[23:08] and the angel of the lord appeared unto
[23:10] him in a flame of fire out of the midst
[23:12] of a bush and he looked and behold the
[23:14] bush burned with fire and the bush was
[23:17] not consumed
[23:18] and moses said i will now turn aside and
[23:21] see this great sight why the bush is not
[23:23] burned
[23:24] see so many times we we get accustomed
[23:27] to bible stories and
[23:29] and we read things and we just read them
[23:31] and read them and read them but but
[23:32] there's always sometimes the thought
[23:35] just strikes you when it strikes you you
[23:37] read it like you've never read it before
[23:39] and you think why did god do it this way
[23:43] like why didn't god just come
[23:45] why didn't the angel appear as a man and
[23:47] talk to him
[23:48] why in a burning bush
[23:50] and and so i just want to read and i
[23:52] want to follow this thought as we go but
[23:54] just think about that he saw a great
[23:56] sight the bush is not burned
[23:59] and so moses said i will now turn aside
[24:01] i'm sorry verse 3 i will now turn aside
[24:03] and see this great sight why the bush is
[24:06] not burned and brother branham tells us
[24:08] and we're going to read a quote here
[24:10] that moses was raised in all this
[24:12] scientific understanding and knowledge
[24:14] and so it that bush got his attention
[24:17] because it was burning but it was not
[24:19] consumed and he had some scientific
[24:21] background and understanding being
[24:23] educated in egypt and it caught his
[24:25] attention
[24:27] and when the lord saw that he turned
[24:29] aside to see
[24:30] god called unto him out of the midst
[24:33] of the bush and said moses moses and he
[24:35] said here am i
[24:37] and he said draw nigh he said draw not
[24:40] not nigh hither put off thy shoes from
[24:43] thy feet for the place where i'll now
[24:45] stand this is holy ground moreover he
[24:47] said i am the god of thy father
[24:49] the god of abraham the god of isaac the
[24:52] god of jacob and moses hid his face for
[24:55] he was afraid to look upon god
[24:57] and the lord said i have surely seen the
[24:59] affliction of my people which are in
[25:01] egypt and i've heard their cry by reason
[25:03] of their tax masters for i know their
[25:05] sorrows and i am come down
[25:10] i want you to catch that i
[25:12] am come down god was not saying i'm
[25:16] coming i will come i've come before he
[25:19] said i've come down
[25:21] and you know so many times when god
[25:23] comes down amen we're looking for a
[25:25] certain something amen and moses didn't
[25:28] know he was supposed to be looking for a
[25:29] burning bush but he saw this bush
[25:31] burning and it attracted his attention
[25:33] and when he got near to the attraction
[25:36] the attraction began to speak to him and
[25:38] when the attraction began to speak to
[25:39] him it began to declare amen the
[25:42] attraction began to declare who was
[25:44] really in the attraction
[25:47] it was god he said i am god i am the god
[25:50] of thy fathers i am the god of abraham
[25:53] isaac and jacob and he's beginning to
[25:55] reveal to him i am the god of those
[25:57] saints that are still alive amen they're
[25:59] not dead i'm god of the living not the
[26:01] dead jesus brings that up but i'm the
[26:03] god of everyone that i made the promise
[26:06] to i am your god of your father the god
[26:08] of abraham the god of isaac the god of
[26:10] jacob so he begins to declare who he is
[26:14] and he says and then he starts to talk
[26:16] about the promise and he starts to talk
[26:18] about the condition of his people amen
[26:20] in the promise that he's made them and
[26:22] he says i come
[26:23] for verse 8 again and i am come down to
[26:25] deliver them out of the hand of the
[26:27] egyptians and to bring them up out of
[26:29] that land into a good land and large
[26:32] into a land flowing with milk and honey
[26:34] unto the place of the canaanites and the
[26:36] hittites and the amorites and the
[26:38] perizzites and the hivites and the
[26:40] jebusites
[26:41] and now therefore behold the cry of the
[26:44] children of israel has come up unto me
[26:46] and i've also seen the oppression where
[26:48] with the egyptians oppressed them
[26:50] come now therefore and i will send thee
[26:53] unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring
[26:55] forth my people
[26:56] the children of israel out of egypt
[27:00] so catch this now the attraction amen on
[27:03] the mount goddess attention but the
[27:05] attraction brought him to a certain
[27:07] place and god began to speak to him out
[27:10] of the attraction and begin to
[27:12] declare himself and moses's commission
[27:15] and that god has now come down and that
[27:18] now god was going to send moses amen so
[27:21] god was coming down to deliver the
[27:23] children of israel but when the children
[27:25] of israel saw the deliverance come they
[27:27] didn't see god they saw moses
[27:32] because god says i've come down now you
[27:35] go amen and what was that god was coming
[27:37] down to deliver but he was going to use
[27:39] a man to do the delivering and so now
[27:42] when god come down he was commissioning
[27:44] the right man to go amen and bring the
[27:46] children out it wasn't moses doing the
[27:48] work it was god doing the work amen
[27:50] moses was the vessel that he was using
[27:56] and i was listening
[27:58] to a message the third exodus
[28:01] and this is where this thought came
[28:04] brother branham
[28:05] in the third exodus
[28:07] he starts to read the same scripture
[28:09] passage we just read
[28:11] and when he gets to the fourth verse
[28:13] let's read that together he says
[28:15] something interesting
[28:16] he said and when the lord saw that he
[28:18] turned aside to sea
[28:21] and brother man stops he says i want to
[28:23] lay emphasis on that
[28:26] i want to lay emphasis on that so let's
[28:27] read it again and when the lord saw that
[28:30] he turned aside to see
[28:32] and he says i want to lay emphasis on
[28:34] that so i kept waiting for him to lay
[28:36] emphasis on that
[28:38] and i kept waiting and i kept waiting
[28:40] and he never came back to it he just
[28:41] wanted to emphasize that statement and
[28:44] as i meditated on it god kept drawing my
[28:46] attention to it and god kept emphasizing
[28:48] that statement to me amen because god
[28:51] had set an attraction on the mountain
[28:54] amen and god was watching to see what
[28:56] moses would do about the attraction and
[28:59] it says when when the lord when when the
[29:02] lord saw that he turned aside to sea
[29:05] god called unto him out of the midst of
[29:07] the bush so god was watching what moses
[29:10] would do with this attraction amen he
[29:12] set an attraction moses was attracted to
[29:14] the attraction and when the lord saw
[29:16] that he that he turned to side to see
[29:19] then he began to speak to him
[29:21] and this is where god began to really
[29:23] really begin to deal with me on this
[29:25] because there's been an attraction in
[29:27] our day there's been a sign on the
[29:29] mountain amen and and and what kind of
[29:32] attraction is it and who's it supposed
[29:33] to attract
[29:36] in the voice of the sign
[29:39] he says
[29:40] now notice when this unusual thing never
[29:43] had happened in the world as we know of
[29:46] it was just the time of the exodus the
[29:48] exodus was at hand and when the exodus
[29:50] means being taken out brought out
[29:53] and now we find out that usually just as
[29:55] those joint crossroads of an exodus then
[29:58] the unusual begins to happen
[30:00] listen that's true for god's great plan
[30:03] for his children but that's true in our
[30:04] lives too whenever we come to a
[30:07] crossroads unusual things begin to
[30:09] happen
[30:11] we got to pay attention to those unusual
[30:13] things
[30:15] i i just want to stop and inject this
[30:17] this is not really what i intended to go
[30:19] into but but you know whenever we get
[30:22] into crossroads there's always
[30:24] transitions and crossroads in our lives
[30:27] amen but god is always so good to do
[30:29] something amen supernatural in some way
[30:32] bring an attraction and speak to us out
[30:34] of the attraction amen and we've got to
[30:36] be careful that we're not so stuck in a
[30:39] right and we're not so blind to what
[30:41] god's doing that we don't open our eyes
[30:43] and see that god is trying to attract
[30:46] our attention so he can speak to us
[30:48] unusual things happen unusual things are
[30:50] said unusual circumstances work around
[30:53] us amen and we we've got to be aware you
[30:55] know and moses could have been so uh you
[30:58] know moses could have been so frustrated
[31:00] with what the condition of his life he
[31:03] could have been upset because he had a
[31:05] hot tempered wife and there might have
[31:06] been an exchange that wasn't so pleasant
[31:08] that morning
[31:10] and he's out tending the the flock and
[31:13] he he's hurting the flock and and maybe
[31:15] he's got one that's just not not
[31:17] listening maybe he's got one that's just
[31:19] not cooperating and he's so frustrated
[31:21] his head's down and he's in the molly
[31:23] grumps and he could look up on the
[31:24] mountain i don't know if he looked this
[31:26] way or that way i don't know which way
[31:27] he looked but he looked and he saw a
[31:28] fire and he could just see the fire and
[31:30] drop his head and say my life stinks and
[31:32] i don't know why
[31:37] it's what we all do
[31:39] it's what we all do god is so good to
[31:42] put an attraction amen and do something
[31:44] to get our attention amen but we've got
[31:47] to break out of our rat and we've got to
[31:49] get our heads you know out of the my
[31:51] life is horrible everything's going
[31:53] wrong
[31:54] maybe god's got you in a transition time
[31:56] amen maybe you're coming to a crossroads
[31:58] and if you come to that place look
[32:00] around because he's got a way of drawing
[32:02] your attention amen he's got a way of
[32:04] doing something out of the normal and an
[32:07] unusual way that he can talk to you out
[32:09] of that way
[32:12] so this is what god does for his whole
[32:14] nation amen that's what he does for us
[32:16] individually
[32:18] as well at least that's been my
[32:19] experience many times
[32:23] so he says
[32:26] the unusual begins to happen i believe
[32:29] we're there again
[32:30] i believe we're there at the exodus of
[32:32] the bride to go meet the bridegroom i
[32:34] believe the exodus is at hand
[32:37] and this exit is to be brought from
[32:39] egypt back to their homeland where they
[32:41] were promised to come was just at hand
[32:43] and god had to re-educate his man
[32:46] remember moses was educated for 40 years
[32:48] getting all of his doctor's degrees and
[32:50] everything and it taken god just another
[32:52] 40 years to take out of him what
[32:55] education had been put in him
[32:57] 40 years in the wilderness what taken it
[32:59] out taken
[33:01] take in out it was to put it in
[33:04] then
[33:05] then and all this great thing was out of
[33:08] him god appeared to him in a form of a
[33:10] burning bush
[33:11] now i'll show you that it was out of him
[33:13] all that teaching he had learned was now
[33:15] worked out of him
[33:17] now if not now moses being a scientist
[33:19] he would have went to take some of those
[33:21] leaves off a tree and take them down to
[33:23] the lavatory and have them examine to
[33:25] see what kind of chemical it was sprayed
[33:26] with that the tree wouldn't burn and not
[33:28] burn up sea
[33:30] because now the egyptians were smart
[33:32] scientific people more smarter in
[33:33] science than we are today proves that
[33:36] they could embalm a body that still
[33:37] looks natural today we can't do that
[33:39] build a pyramid we can't do that the
[33:41] things that they they had were far
[33:43] beyond our science today and so moses
[33:45] was trained in all the wisdom so that
[33:47] made him a scientist so you see when he
[33:50] come to the presence of this bush he
[33:52] knowed the bush had what he lacked
[33:57] he wasn't going there to try to discover
[33:59] the secrets in the bush he wasn't there
[34:01] to try to explain amen how it could burn
[34:04] and not be he was mesmerized by it
[34:06] caught his attention god knew how to get
[34:07] his attention but when he got there and
[34:10] that voice spoke to him he realized that
[34:13] this bush has what i lack
[34:17] if we could only do that today if we
[34:20] could only know that the phenomenon of
[34:23] god has got what we lack in our
[34:25] denomination
[34:28] i want to read that again so we catch it
[34:31] he knowed the bush had what he lacked
[34:34] if we could only do that today if we
[34:36] could only know the phenomena of god has
[34:39] got what we lack in our denominations
[34:43] what our education system lack god has
[34:45] got it in the phenomena of the presence
[34:47] of christ that's what we need
[34:49] the phenomena of this day
[34:52] has what the denomination lacks
[34:55] just like that burning bush had what
[34:56] moses lacks moses didn't go to use his
[34:59] intellect to figure it out i mean god
[35:01] knew how to attract him but when he got
[35:03] there there was something else taking
[35:04] place amen god was now a man going to
[35:07] unravel the mystery of moses's life
[35:11] because moses was born a proper child
[35:13] his mother became his nurse the prophet
[35:16] of god tells us she began to tell him
[35:17] amen the stories and the prophecies and
[35:19] the promise to abraham and tell him that
[35:21] he was born to be this deliverer and he
[35:24] had heard it from his mom and he
[35:26] believed it amen and he went to go act
[35:28] upon it when he went to go act upon it
[35:30] he failed he killed one egyptian and was
[35:32] rejected by his brethren and so he goes
[35:34] in that rejection amen and he runs into
[35:36] the wilderness and he's there 40 years
[35:39] tending his father-in-law sheep away
[35:41] from the commission moving in the
[35:43] opposite direction
[35:44] of what he thought his life's purpose
[35:46] was of what he thought he was supposed
[35:48] to be doing
[35:50] but in the in a moment god caught his
[35:53] attention in an attraction on the
[35:54] mountain and in the attraction on the
[35:56] mountain when he drew near god was
[35:58] watching for him to draw near and when
[36:00] he drew near god began to speak to him
[36:02] and when god spoke to him he unraveled
[36:04] this whole mystery amen moses thought he
[36:07] had missed something moses thought he
[36:09] had he had walked away and now god was
[36:11] going to get somebody else to deliver
[36:13] the people or maybe i misunderstood or
[36:15] it wasn't for me or i had the wrong idea
[36:17] you can only imagine what moses had
[36:19] thought
[36:20] for 40 years you can only imagine in his
[36:23] backs and condition on the backside of
[36:24] the desert amen but god was training him
[36:27] and working certain things out of him so
[36:29] god could use him and in a moment in the
[36:32] phenomena of god amen at the presence of
[36:34] the burning bush the attraction on the
[36:36] mountain that attracted him when that
[36:38] attraction began to speak to him the
[36:41] spoken the the presence of god speaking
[36:43] to him through that attraction began to
[36:45] unravel the mystery amen and tell him he
[36:47] was who his mom told him he was the
[36:49] promise is sure and i have come down to
[36:52] deliver my people
[36:54] because it was never supposed to be you
[36:56] moses it was supposed to be me in you
[37:00] you never were supposed to do it by
[37:02] yourself you were never supposed to
[37:03] accomplish the calling and the purpose
[37:05] you weren't the one it was my promise
[37:08] amen
[37:10] you were just a tool that i was going to
[37:12] use and you got discouraged because you
[37:14] thought it was you that had to do it you
[37:16] didn't realize amen you were supposed to
[37:18] be the tool
[37:19] amen
[37:21] so in the presence of the phenomenon and
[37:23] the presence of the attraction on the
[37:25] mountain the voice that began to speak
[37:27] back begin to set everything in order
[37:29] according to the promise
[37:34] you are the chosen vessel
[37:37] i am the god of your father
[37:39] abraham isaac and jacob i have heard the
[37:42] cry of my people i am taking them to the
[37:45] land i promise i have come down
[37:49] and now you go
[37:52] praise god
[37:54] we know moses had been so thoroughly
[37:56] whipped out that he began to argue with
[37:58] god
[38:00] he had been so thoroughly god had done
[38:02] such a good job of scrubbing all of
[38:04] moses out of moses that moses now says i
[38:07] can't talk and he says well i'll give
[38:09] you abraham say well they won't listen
[38:10] to me or i'll give you two signs and and
[38:12] god was working with moses to get him
[38:14] back into the commission and giving him
[38:16] signs and giving him uh his brother to
[38:18] speak on his behalf he had been so
[38:20] whipped out he thought he couldn't do it
[38:22] but but the burning bush had what he was
[38:26] lacking amen
[38:29] he says again in the voice of the sign
[38:32] now notice he is going to speak by his
[38:34] promised words something that he said he
[38:36] is going to do notice
[38:38] i have heard and i remember my promise i
[38:41] heard their cries in egypt i remember
[38:43] what i promised abraham
[38:45] see what he's going to do the attraction
[38:47] he attracted his attention
[38:50] now he has got his word
[38:52] so he attracted his attention so he
[38:54] could give him his word
[38:57] he's going to give it to the prophet
[38:58] moses because that was and ever is his
[39:01] way of speaking
[39:04] now
[39:05] i want to read a quote now out of what
[39:08] is the attraction on the mountain
[39:10] because there was an attraction on that
[39:12] mountain in that day but there's been an
[39:14] attraction on the mountain mount sunset
[39:16] in our day
[39:18] and i just want to read about that in
[39:20] this quote for just a minute it's a
[39:21] lengthy quote but just just pay close
[39:23] attention
[39:25] brothers and i started up the mountain
[39:27] running as hard as i could on the other
[39:29] side all of a sudden i thought somebody
[39:31] shot me i never heard such a blast it
[39:34] shook the whole country and when it did
[39:36] standing before me with seven angels in
[39:38] a cluster
[39:39] i met brother fred and them a little
[39:41] after said what was it
[39:43] i said that was it what are you going to
[39:45] do return home for thus saith the lord
[39:48] the seven mysteries that's been hid in
[39:50] the bible all these years
[39:52] these denominations and everything god
[39:54] is going to open up those seven
[39:56] mysteries to us in the seven seals
[39:59] there was that circle coming up from the
[40:01] earth like a mist forming when it did it
[40:04] went plum up into the mountain begin to
[40:06] circle on westward from the way it comes
[40:08] science founded after a while 30 miles
[40:10] high 25 miles across just exactly in the
[40:13] circle of the pyramid
[40:16] and the other day standing there turned
[40:18] the picture to the right and there is
[40:20] jesus as he was in the seven church ages
[40:24] so he's got this picture and it's the
[40:26] capstone and
[40:27] at the time that this happens
[40:30] when brother branham has this uh when he
[40:33] has this experience on sunset mountain
[40:36] brother branham doesn't know somebody
[40:38] took a picture of it
[40:40] he doesn't know anybody else had a
[40:43] picture or or saw it he knows what he
[40:45] saw
[40:46] and what cesar and what he was caught up
[40:48] into was a confirmation of a vision that
[40:51] he had and in that in that attraction on
[40:53] the mountain when he was caught into it
[40:55] amen to begin to speak to him and send
[40:57] him back into his commission to go back
[41:00] east to preach the seven seals
[41:03] he was doing the same thing for him it
[41:05] did for moses it was beginning to tell
[41:07] him that now is the time for the opening
[41:09] of the seals and you're the one that i'm
[41:11] going to use to do it go back east
[41:16] and later he's looking at the pictures
[41:19] he's later in may you know the
[41:21] publication of life magazine comes out
[41:23] and sometime after that brother benham
[41:25] has shown the picture and and then he's
[41:27] looking at this picture and and in the
[41:29] picture
[41:30] the voice speaks to him and says turn it
[41:32] right
[41:33] and he thinks i'm looking at it right
[41:36] so no turn it to the right so he thought
[41:38] he said i thought maybe he meant to the
[41:39] right and he turned it to the right and
[41:40] he said there it was
[41:42] and in the within the white wig of the
[41:44] angel's wings was hoffman's head of
[41:46] christ it was jesus christ and that's
[41:48] him and that's what he's referring to
[41:50] here he says there turn the picture to
[41:52] the right and there is jesus as he was
[41:54] in the seven church ages the white wig
[41:56] on showing supreme deity he's alpha and
[41:59] omega he's the first and the last he's
[42:02] the supreme judge of all eternity

[44:04] sunset peaked there that's exactly where
[44:06] it happened i never knew known until the
[44:08] other day
[44:10] everything that shall that shall never
[44:12] die it's constantly unrolling itself
[44:14] from the very thing happening to the
[44:16] picture being jesus standing looking at
[44:18] us and now exactly on sunset mountain
[44:21] and the sunset light the evening light
[44:23] has come god vindicating himself what is
[44:26] it it's a fact that god in christ are
[44:28] one the white how many seen it the white
[44:31] wig upon him as we talked in revelation
[44:33] 1 see the supreme deity supreme
[44:35] authority no other voice no other god no
[44:37] other nothing in him dwells the fullness
[44:39] of the godhead bodily the angels
[44:41] themselves was his wig amen what's
[44:44] happened upon mount sunset god
[44:47] confirming his word
[44:49] what happened upon mount sinai in the
[44:52] burning bush god confirming his word
[44:55] what happened in sunset mountain god
[44:57] confirming his word
[45:01] that's what all this noise is about
[45:03] notice it's god fulfilling his promised
[45:05] word again of revelation 10 1-7
[45:09] what was that all about revelations 10
[45:11] 1-7
[45:13] that's what it was all about the cloud
[45:16] the light the cloud on sunset mountain
[45:19] being caught up in a constellation of
[45:20] angels told to come back east for the
[45:22] preaching of the seven says what's it
[45:23] all about it's the fulfillment of the
[45:25] word it's a confirmation of the word
[45:26] revelation 10 1-7
[45:29] and in the days of the sounding of the
[45:30] seventh angel's message the mystery of
[45:32] god should be finished the hidden
[45:33] mystery of revelations 10 1-7 the last
[45:37] message to the last church age fulfills
[45:39] exactly in this age saint luke 17 30 the
[45:42] day when the son of man shall be
[45:45] revealed
[45:47] what is the attraction on the mountain
[45:49] god fulfilling his word
[45:53] if we could have the powerpoint brother
[45:54] franco if you don't mind bringing that
[45:56] up for me
[45:58] i just want to go through a couple
[45:59] quotes
[46:01] i didn't do a very good job brother
[46:02] franco helped me get a few slides
[46:04] together i didn't do a very good job of
[46:05] filling them out but i just want to
[46:07] share
[46:08] a couple things
[46:10] out of the third exodus
[46:12] it says now look how simple he does it i
[46:15] have come down i heard the cry remember
[46:18] my promise i've come down to do it i'm
[46:21] sending you
[46:22] on mount sinai in the attraction on the
[46:25] mountain it was god declaring that i've
[46:27] come down to fulfill the word i've come
[46:29] down to keep my promise but i'm sending
[46:32] you
[46:33] you do it i'm going to be with you
[46:36] certainly i'll be with you and my never
[46:38] failing presence will be with you
[46:39] wherever you go don't be afraid see i'm
[46:41] coming down to deliver i'm sure the
[46:43] spiritual mind catches that
[46:46] brother branham's running a parallel and
[46:48] he's expecting the spiritual mind to
[46:49] catch that
[46:51] and the message the absolutely said when
[46:52] moses met this burning bush you know and
[46:55] that burning bush
[46:57] claim proved to be god that's that light
[46:59] that pillar of fire that proved to be
[47:01] god and i believe that god come in moses
[47:05] because watch him in his creative power
[47:07] moses shine then with the fire
[47:11] so brother branham is saying
[47:13] that
[47:14] that that sign
[47:15] that took place on mount sinai that
[47:18] burning bush that caught moses attention
[47:21] god come down in a certain way and he
[47:25] had a certain kind of an attraction and
[47:27] that attraction was for that day and
[47:29] that attraction was for a specific
[47:31] purpose
[47:32] and it was for a specific purpose and
[47:34] god knew how to attract his attention
[47:36] and in the attraction when when moses
[47:38] was drawn to that the attraction began
[47:41] to speak to him
[47:44] this catches the attraction began to
[47:46] speak and when he began to speak it
[47:47] began to speak to prophecy for his day
[47:50] the fulfillment of the word for his day
[47:52] and it was a declaration the traction
[47:55] and the voice behind the attraction was
[47:57] a declaration that god had come to
[47:59] fulfill his word and now he had a vessel
[48:02] here at the attraction that he was going
[48:03] to use to go fulfill it in
[48:06] i'm come down to deliver them you go
[48:09] and it was god coming in moses it was
[48:11] god coming through and working through a
[48:14] vessel amen so that when god come down
[48:16] to deliver the children they couldn't
[48:18] see they didn't even see what moses saw
[48:21] they they just had to believe moses and
[48:23] god gave him signs so they would believe
[48:25] him but they didn't see what moses saw
[48:28] they had to take his testimony of it
[48:30] they didn't see the attraction they
[48:32] could only see the signs that followed
[48:34] and the word that he was bringing the
[48:35] vindication amen but but they had to
[48:38] trust that this is what god told him and
[48:40] that god was come down and he was sent
[48:43] and god was there to deliver them but
[48:45] they couldn't see another being they
[48:47] couldn't see another physical form
[48:51] they had to take the one that had been
[48:53] at the attraction and they had to take
[48:55] the one that had heard the voice and the
[48:57] one that heard the word and come down
[48:58] and he had to say now listen he sent me
[49:01] down to tell you that he's here
[49:06] he sent me here to tell you that he has
[49:08] come down to deliver you and you're
[49:10] saying how has he come down show me how
[49:12] he's coming where is he at and he's
[49:14] saying i've got these signs i don't want
[49:16] to look at you moses i want to see god
[49:18] but he says but he told me i'll show you
[49:20] these signs and by these signs you'll
[49:22] know that i'm his representative and
[49:24] they're saying what are you trying to
[49:26] say i'm trying to say that god is here
[49:30] i'm trying to say that god has come down
[49:33] in this day to fulfill his promise and
[49:35] he attracted me in an attraction on the
[49:37] mountain and that attraction spoke to me
[49:39] and told me now is the time for the
[49:41] prophecy i thought it was earlier i made
[49:43] a mistake and i thought i wasn't even
[49:45] qualified anymore the one but that
[49:47] attraction told me that now's the time
[49:50] he's the one he's come down and he's
[49:52] coming through me
[49:55] he sent me
[49:57] to represent this deliverance
[50:02] they had to believe moses
[50:04] moses was carrying the message
[50:08] moses had the vindication moses
[50:11] had been at the attraction on the
[50:12] mountain moses had heard the voice moses
[50:15] received the word and moses was now
[50:17] giving it out
[50:20] in our day there's been an attraction on
[50:22] the mountain
[50:24] brother venom saw the constellation of
[50:26] seven angels coming as a as a
[50:29] constellation in a pyramid form
[50:33] he was caught up into this constellation
[50:38] and
[50:41] i'm going to skip ahead here
[50:45] i want to read two passages of scripture
[50:47] and i want to get back to this
[50:50] revelations 8 1
[50:52] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[50:54] there was silence in heaven for about
[50:56] the space of half an hour
[50:59] see there was a prophecy in the old
[51:01] testament
[51:03] that your children to abraham your
[51:05] children shall show jordan in a strange
[51:07] land for 400 years but i'll bring them
[51:09] out with a mighty hand and i'll bring
[51:10] him back to this land of promise that
[51:13] word was there amen but that word was
[51:15] waiting for an attraction on the
[51:17] mountain to put it in the in the action
[51:19] to attract the prophet and get the
[51:20] prophet into action it was waiting for
[51:22] god's time when it was god's time he
[51:24] brought an attraction on the mountain
[51:27] but there's been another prophecy that
[51:29] has been laying in the bible waiting for
[51:31] an attraction on the mountain to put it
[51:33] in the action
[51:35] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[51:37] there was silence in heaven about the
[51:38] space
[51:40] of half an hour
[51:41] but what's that got to do with the cloud
[51:43] it's got everything to do with that
[51:45] cloud
[51:49] revelation 10 1-4 and i saw another
[51:51] mighty angel come down from heaven
[51:54] clothed with a cloud
[51:56] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[51:57] face was as it were the sun and his feet
[51:59] as pillars of fire
[52:01] brother bam said it's none other but
[52:02] christ it could be
[52:05] the angel of the covenant christ and his
[52:07] feet as pillars of fire and he had in
[52:09] his hand a little book open and he set
[52:11] his right foot upon the sea and his left
[52:13] foot upon the earth and cried with a
[52:15] loud voice as when a lion roareth and
[52:17] when he had cried seven thunders uttered
[52:19] their voices
[52:21] and when the seven thunders had uttered
[52:22] their voices i was about to write and i
[52:24] heard a voice from heaven saying unto me
[52:26] seal up those things which the seven
[52:28] thunders uttered and write them not so
[52:31] what the seven thunders uttered was
[52:34] sealed up so what the seven thunders
[52:36] uttered became silent
[52:39] so the silence on the seventh seal and
[52:42] the silence of the seven thunders in
[52:43] revelation 10 go go together brother
[52:46] bennett said they're connected they're
[52:47] the same thing
[52:52] and what are you
[52:53] what are we waiting for for the thunders
[52:55] watch the pattern in the pattern christ
[52:58] comes down clothed with the clown
[53:00] when he comes down and sets his foot on
[53:03] one foot on the sea and one foot on the
[53:05] land then he
[53:06] cries with the loud roars when a lion
[53:08] roars and seven thunders utter their
[53:10] voice so to get the seven thunders to
[53:12] utter their voice amen this mighty angel
[53:15] has to come down with a book that's
[53:17] already open in his hand
[53:20] you come down with an open book and
[53:21] seven thunders utter their voices
[53:25] what does that have to do with the cloud
[53:26] it has everything in the world to do
[53:28] with that cloud amen
[53:36] here's a quote
[53:39] out of it is the rising of the sun
[53:43] he is the one who opened those seals
[53:45] he is those seals
[53:49] for the whole word of god is christ
[53:52] and christ is the seals that was opened
[53:55] what is the opening of the seals then
[53:57] revealing christ
[53:59] and the very seven angels which
[54:01] represent the seven churches all
[54:03] completed
[54:06] and we couldn't even see it they did
[54:09] they took the picture not us
[54:14] and there he is standing there supreme
[54:16] judge showing that he is alpha and omega
[54:19] the beginning and the end what
[54:21] identification quickening power did that
[54:24] to us quickening power lets us see his
[54:27] coming
[54:29] there's a reason that i'm reading all
[54:30] this and i pray that god will just help
[54:32] me share it so it doesn't look like a
[54:34] bunch of fragmented things but but may
[54:36] god bring it all together for us he says
[54:38] here the opening of the seals is
[54:40] revealing christ
[54:42] and the very seven angels that's in that
[54:44] cloud amen they represent the seven
[54:47] church ages all completed so when you
[54:50] see that cloud it's the completion of
[54:52] the seven church ages
[54:54] those seven angels represent the seven
[54:56] churches completed because when the
[54:58] seven church ages are completed now he's
[55:00] come down to unite with his bride at the
[55:02] completion of the seven church ages
[55:04] so when you see that cloud you recognize
[55:07] where we are in time we've come to the
[55:09] completion of the seven church ages and
[55:11] that means that brings us to the end of
[55:13] time and at the end of time there's an
[55:15] end of time seal and the end of time
[55:17] seal is the seventh seal and at the
[55:19] opening of the seventh seal it marks
[55:22] that we're at the end of time
[55:24] at the completion of the seven church
[55:26] ages which is represented in seven
[55:29] angels amend their wings making making a
[55:31] wig at first brother brennam saw a
[55:33] capstone at first he saw seven angels at
[55:35] first he saw the constellation
[55:39] but after a while he was told to take
[55:41] the capstone the capping off the
[55:43] finishing of the pyramid the all seven
[55:45] church ages complete and down you're
[55:47] being capped off by the word of god by
[55:49] the revelation amen that's been hid in
[55:52] this bible by the revelation that's been
[55:54] silent all these years
[55:58] and he he knew it was the
[56:00] angels amen he knew it was the
[56:02] completion of the seventh church he knew
[56:04] it was the capstone and the capping off
[56:06] but what he realized when he was told to
[56:08] turn it to the right when he so to turn
[56:09] it to the right he realized it was
[56:11] christ amen it was jesus christ coming
[56:14] to unite with his bride it was the
[56:16] headship coming to the body amen for the
[56:18] marriage
[56:25] in the seventh seal he says another
[56:27] thing i want you to notice
[56:29] what taken place
[56:31] and if you're listening to the tape of
[56:32] what time is it sir you will notice that
[56:34] one angel was very notable to me
[56:37] the rest of them just seemed ordinarily
[56:40] brother kyle went into this on sunday
[56:42] but this angel was a noted angel he was
[56:45] to my left in the constellation in the
[56:46] form of a pyramid and you remember it
[56:49] was in the pyramid where the mysterious
[56:51] white rock was not written on
[56:55] now
[56:55] he's referring back to junior jackson's
[56:58] dream
[56:59] and junior jackson had a dream that was
[57:01] this great hillside and brother ben
[57:02] calls it a pyramid amen and their water
[57:05] had washed off the soil and the grass
[57:07] and there was there was strange
[57:09] engravings like hieroglyphs around it
[57:11] and brother ben was walking around
[57:12] interpreting the words on the outside of
[57:15] the stone to the people and when he got
[57:17] done interpreting all that word amen he
[57:20] reached up and grabbed a sharp
[57:22] object like a crowbar or maybe like the
[57:24] king's sword like like like brother kyle
[57:27] was saying
[57:28] a sharp object anyways let's just say it
[57:31] that way and he pried the top of that
[57:33] off and underneath was white rock and he
[57:35] said the sun's never shown on this amen
[57:37] this is unwritten word something in the
[57:40] bible that has not been revealed
[57:43] what in the bible has not been revealed
[57:46] what in the bible was not written amen
[57:48] that silence amen when the seventh seal
[57:51] opened there was silence nothing was
[57:53] written then when the seven thunders
[57:54] uttered their voices nothing was written
[57:57] it's there it's in the bible we know
[57:59] it's there but nothing's been written
[58:04] so brother branham now when he's talking
[58:06] about services it's the time the
[58:08] constellation the form of the pyramid he
[58:10] goes right back to junior jackson's
[58:12] dream
[58:13] and he says and you remember it was in
[58:15] the pyramid where the mysterious white
[58:17] rock was not written on
[58:20] and the angels took me into that pyramid
[58:23] of themselves
[58:26] follow this
[58:29] the angels took me into the pyramid of
[58:31] themselves
[58:32] the mysteries of god known only to them
[58:37] and now they with the messengers that
[58:39] come to interpret and they with the
[58:42] messengers that come to interpret that
[58:44] pyramid or that message of the secret of
[58:46] these seven seals which lays with inside
[58:49] the pyramid
[58:51] brother said inside that pyramid
[58:54] is a mystery
[58:57] and these seven angels
[59:00] i just want to read it correctly
[59:02] these seven angels took me into that
[59:04] pyramid of themselves
[59:07] the mysteries of god known only to them
[59:12] and now they with the messages that came
[59:13] to interpret the pyramid or the message
[59:16] of the secret of those seven seals which
[59:18] lays with inside the pyramid
[59:21] god brother brahm is drawing our
[59:23] attention to the fact that the mystery
[59:26] that laid in the bible this seven
[59:28] thunder mystery this silence in the
[59:31] seventh seal this part that you know is
[59:33] part of the word you know it's in the
[59:35] bible it's in there but nothing's
[59:37] written in it nothing's written about it
[59:39] amen but these angels caught me into the
[59:41] pyramid of themselves the mysteries that
[59:44] are only known to them
[59:47] so brother branham gets caught
[59:50] into the constellation
[59:53] i think this is important and this is oh
[59:56] god help me i just want to spend some
[59:57] time on this
[1:00:02] he was caught into this pyramid
[1:00:05] in the pyramid is the mystery
[1:00:09] the unwritten word
[1:00:11] the mystery
[1:00:13] and so now the mysteries in the pyramid
[1:00:16] i want you to catch that where's the
[1:00:17] mystery in the pyramid
[1:00:20] amen and this pyramid is made up by the
[1:00:23] seven messengers they have this mystery
[1:00:25] all to themselves now and brother
[1:00:28] branham is caught up into the pyramid
[1:00:31] what's in the pyramid the mystery
[1:00:33] where's brother branham in the pyramid
[1:00:36] what's in the pyramid the mystery
[1:00:39] where's brother branham in the pyramid
[1:00:42] so brother branham he gets caught up and
[1:00:44] told to go back east and now when he
[1:00:46] walks back he's the mystery that's come
[1:00:49] out of the pyramid
[1:00:52] i want you to catch that when moses goes
[1:00:54] into the mountain and gets the
[1:00:55] commission now he's the mystery amen
[1:00:58] with him is the deliverance with him is
[1:01:01] the the the knowledge that god has come
[1:01:03] down to deliver his people with him has
[1:01:05] come the timing of deliverance amen and
[1:01:07] the method for deliverance he is now the
[1:01:10] mystery part of that prophecy is now
[1:01:12] with moses because moses was at the
[1:01:14] burning bush he was attracted to the
[1:01:16] attraction the attraction spoke to him
[1:01:18] and gave him the word and now he comes
[1:01:20] down and he's the mystery
[1:01:23] of that prophecy
[1:01:26] and now brother ram gets caught up into
[1:01:28] the the the constellation and he's told
[1:01:30] to go back for the preaching of the
[1:01:32] seven seals and now he's walking from
[1:01:35] this attraction amen and now he
[1:01:38] he is the mystery
[1:01:42] and i
[1:01:45] i wish
[1:01:47] that i could do a better job of
[1:01:49] intellectually explaining that but god
[1:01:51] is not going to let me do that it's got
[1:01:53] to be caught by revelation
[1:01:55] i'm saying what i'm saying by the
[1:01:57] inspiration of god knowing good well
[1:02:00] that i cannot piece this together any
[1:02:03] simpler than i'm doing it now but it's
[1:02:05] absolutely the truth there was a mystery
[1:02:07] in that prophet after he got caught up
[1:02:08] in the constellations
[1:02:11] and it was the mystery of the of the
[1:02:13] seventh seal amen and that seventh seal
[1:02:16] the timing of the of the fulfillment of
[1:02:18] the prophecy when it was going to come
[1:02:20] how it was going to come how god was
[1:02:22] going to speak those seven thunders it
[1:02:23] was now in this mystery man
[1:02:29] that had come from the attraction
[1:02:31] on the mountain
[1:02:34] and he got caught up
[1:02:36] and what was he caught up into
[1:02:38] he was caught up into the pyramid
[1:02:41] of the seven angels
[1:02:43] he was caught up into the location of
[1:02:44] the mystery
[1:02:46] and the location of the mystery was in
[1:02:48] that pyramid of the seven angels and
[1:02:49] they represented the seven church ages
[1:02:51] complete because through the seven
[1:02:53] church ages there'd been a mystery
[1:02:54] forming
[1:02:57] nobody understood that mystery that was
[1:02:59] forming but it was forming through the
[1:03:00] seven church ages as those seven church
[1:03:03] age messengers came each angel came and
[1:03:05] it sees in its time to reveal part of
[1:03:07] that mystery and now it was all
[1:03:09] completed and it was time for the
[1:03:10] revelation to be made known and the
[1:03:12] seven angels come down and make the
[1:03:14] pyramids showing that it's now
[1:03:16] completion and he's got caught up into
[1:03:18] the mysterious part where nothing's
[1:03:20] written he's caught into that and he's
[1:03:22] brought back out as the mystery
[1:03:27] but then later he finds out there's a
[1:03:29] picture taken
[1:03:31] and he sees the picture
[1:03:33] then he's told to turn the picture to
[1:03:34] the right
[1:03:37] and he finds out
[1:03:38] where he's been
[1:03:43] he thought he was in the pyramid the
[1:03:44] capstone he thought he was in the
[1:03:46] mystery that was contained in the seven
[1:03:49] angels but then he realized he was in
[1:03:51] the mind of christ amen he had been
[1:03:54] caught up into the very headship amen
[1:03:56] the word himself had caught him up and
[1:03:59] he had been in the mind of god and now
[1:04:01] he was coming out with the mystery of
[1:04:03] the secret of the back part of god's
[1:04:05] mind amen
[1:04:08] these aren't just pictures friends this
[1:04:11] is a living reality in our lives
[1:04:15] he became the mystery because now amen
[1:04:18] he could say at the preaching of the
[1:04:21] seven thunders which was the preaching
[1:04:23] of the seven
[1:04:25] i seals you understand that when he come
[1:04:27] to preach he said seven thunders
[1:04:30] thundering out right in a row one two
[1:04:31] three four five six seven like spelling
[1:04:33] something out amen one blast the blast
[1:04:36] that was on mount sunset amen then seven
[1:04:38] thunders amen one blast when the seals
[1:04:40] open when the first seal there was a
[1:04:42] loud blast amen like a thunder and the
[1:04:44] first beast said come and see then after
[1:04:46] that all seals open now there's been
[1:04:47] another great blast on sunset mountain
[1:04:50] so then there's got to be seven
[1:04:51] somethings open up and it's the
[1:04:52] revelation of the seven thunders the
[1:04:54] preaching of the seven thunders which is
[1:04:56] the revelation of the seven seals
[1:04:58] the interpretation of the symbols
[1:05:02] the opening of the seven seals
[1:05:05] these aren't just
[1:05:06] pictures
[1:05:08] it's not just something to hang on the
[1:05:10] wall because believers hang it on their
[1:05:12] wall
[1:05:14] there's something to it
[1:05:16] brother rem wasn't told to turn it to
[1:05:18] the right so that he had a novelty that
[1:05:20] he could give away and people could see
[1:05:21] and that we could pass it on the card
[1:05:23] no it was identifying what those seven
[1:05:26] angels represented where the mystery was
[1:05:29] i mean the mystery had been in the back
[1:05:30] part of god's mind all this time
[1:05:34] and he got caught up into the headship
[1:05:36] christ and he came out to bring the
[1:05:38] revelation and these angels would come
[1:05:40] one one after another one night after
[1:05:42] another and bring him the revelation and
[1:05:44] he would bring the revelation out amen
[1:05:46] he didn't have
[1:05:48] he himself didn't have the revelation he
[1:05:50] was the vessel that god was going to use
[1:05:54] because only the lamb can break the
[1:05:56] seals amen the prophet can't break the
[1:05:59] seals only the lamb can so he's got to
[1:06:02] come down amen just like god had to come
[1:06:05] down moses couldn't deliver moses tried
[1:06:07] to deliver but he could not deliver it
[1:06:10] was going to come at a time when god
[1:06:11] would attract him on the mountain and
[1:06:13] tell him i have come down now to fulfill
[1:06:15] the word
[1:06:17] in this revelation of the seventh seal
[1:06:19] amen this preaching of the seven
[1:06:21] thunders was not going to take place
[1:06:23] until it was time for christ to come
[1:06:25] down
[1:06:26] that's why he was told to turn the
[1:06:28] picture to the right
[1:06:31] so we knew who was here
[1:06:33] so we know whose mind this was this
[1:06:36] wasn't the mind of
[1:06:37] brother branham amen it was the mind of
[1:06:39] christ amen it was the time for the
[1:06:41] revelation to come forth
[1:06:45] and now he would go into the little room
[1:06:49] day after day
[1:06:52] because in the in the in the revelation
[1:06:54] of the third pool
[1:06:56] when he was taken into the cathedral
[1:06:58] amen and he was told there's a little
[1:06:59] room he said i'll meet you in there and
[1:07:01] he said it'll be your third pool
[1:07:03] and you won't tell it to nobody it'll be
[1:07:05] a total secret
[1:07:08] so i think it's funny that brother
[1:07:10] branham every day to get the
[1:07:11] interpretation amen of the next seal he
[1:07:14] had to go into a little room
[1:07:17] and in the little room he would meet him
[1:07:19] there and give him the interpretation he
[1:07:21] would come out and give it
[1:07:23] and then he would say now i don't know
[1:07:25] what's tomorrow night
[1:07:29] it wasn't him
[1:07:32] it was christ
[1:07:35] god had come down to fulfill the promise
[1:07:37] in our day
[1:07:40] he said i've come down now i send you
[1:07:43] i didn't hear him say that
[1:07:45] i did
[1:07:48] those angels says go back east
[1:07:51] for the interpretation of the seven
[1:07:53] seals
[1:07:55] what was that he was told to go back
[1:07:58] i've come down now you go
[1:08:02] and say what i tell you to say
[1:08:07] see
[1:08:09] brother banner says something in souls
[1:08:11] that are in prison now and i i don't
[1:08:12] understand it i'm not going to try to
[1:08:14] explain it in a way that i understand i
[1:08:15] don't understand it all but he makes
[1:08:17] this statement that i'm beginning to
[1:08:19] understand
[1:08:22] he says
[1:08:23] he says now at this time noah was in the
[1:08:25] ark the bride has sealed him with christ
[1:08:27] the last member has been redeemed the
[1:08:29] sixth seal has produced itself the
[1:08:31] seventh seal brings him back to earth
[1:08:36] the lamb come and took the book out of
[1:08:37] the right hand of him and sat down and
[1:08:39] claimed what he owned
[1:08:40] what he had redeemed that's right
[1:08:43] it's always been that third pool
[1:08:46] there's still many things that i can't
[1:08:48] intellectually explain i can't put it in
[1:08:50] nice pieces
[1:08:52] but the seventh seal brings him back to
[1:08:54] earth
[1:08:58] and the seventh seal brings him back to
[1:09:00] earth to claim his bride
[1:09:03] and to take her in the rapture to unite
[1:09:05] with her
[1:09:06] the seventh seal brings him to earth as
[1:09:08] joseph revealing himself to his brother
[1:09:10] in 144 thousand
[1:09:12] and the seventh seal brings him to earth
[1:09:14] as the son of david in the millennium
[1:09:17] is that true
[1:09:18] so the seventh seal brings him to earth
[1:09:22] the problem is
[1:09:23] we're we want to wait until the
[1:09:25] millennium and say he's come but the
[1:09:28] seventh seal brings him to earth and he
[1:09:30] comes together to get his bride then he
[1:09:32] comes to reveal himself to his brethren
[1:09:34] and then he comes amen to set up his
[1:09:36] kingdom as the son of david what is that
[1:09:38] the seventh seal brings him to earth
[1:09:42] the seventh seal is the end of time seal
[1:09:45] when everything comes to the end the
[1:09:46] seventh seal opens and it marks the end
[1:09:49] amen but brother branham said it's like
[1:09:50] a roman candle going off he says the end
[1:09:53] of one thing then that goes out and five
[1:09:55] more things come out of that then
[1:09:56] another rocket shoots in five more
[1:09:58] things it's not the end like now's the
[1:10:00] end everything's burned off and now the
[1:10:02] millennium sets in
[1:10:04] it's the end of the denominational
[1:10:07] church ages that's ended
[1:10:09] then it becomes the end of gentile world
[1:10:12] domination that's coming to an end then
[1:10:14] it's the end of this and then the end of
[1:10:15] that and the end of this all the way
[1:10:18] until the end of the pollution on the
[1:10:19] earth and it's burnt over with volcanics
[1:10:22] and atomic fire and he comes and
[1:10:24] re-establishes his kingdom on the earth
[1:10:25] for a millennial reign it's ending
[1:10:27] ending ending and he says it even ends
[1:10:30] time
[1:10:32] so time doesn't end until after the
[1:10:34] millennium because it's a thousand years
[1:10:37] so the seventh seal is not this moment
[1:10:41] in time
[1:10:44] but the seventh seal brings him to earth
[1:10:49] just like the prophecy of deliverance
[1:10:51] out of egypt brought god down
[1:10:56] but when god came down to deliver
[1:11:00] he sent a prophet
[1:11:02] and the people were confused
[1:11:05] moses
[1:11:06] why did you bring us out here to die
[1:11:08] moses didn't do anything
[1:11:11] god brought them out there
[1:11:12] [Applause]
[1:11:15] moses why nah now moses
[1:11:18] you got us in trouble now they've
[1:11:20] increased our our quota of bricks and
[1:11:22] they're not providing strong it's gotten
[1:11:23] hard moses didn't do anything they're so
[1:11:26] confused about who's present to deliver
[1:11:28] them
[1:11:30] they think it's moses it's not moses
[1:11:32] it's not brother branham amen he's the
[1:11:34] mystery the mystery is in him but the
[1:11:37] mystery is the coming of the lord christ
[1:11:39] came down with an open book and after
[1:11:41] christ came with an open book seven
[1:11:43] thunders uttered their voices
[1:11:46] and we heard them one night second night
[1:11:49] third night fourth night fifth night
[1:11:51] amen what was it it was the seven
[1:11:53] thunder sounding out
[1:11:57] what's that it shows the seven seals now
[1:11:59] open
[1:12:01] when you when you hear those thunders
[1:12:03] being preached in the seal series it
[1:12:05] shows that now the seventh seal is open
[1:12:08] the seventh seal brings him to earth
[1:12:11] and the seven seals the end of time seal
[1:12:15] marking end of time has begun
[1:12:19] and now this will wrap up and then this
[1:12:22] will wrap up
[1:12:24] and then this will wrap up and then this
[1:12:26] will wrap up and people are still
[1:12:28] waiting for the seventh seal to open and
[1:12:30] i'm telling you the seven seals been
[1:12:32] open amen things are wrapping up
[1:12:34] everything is finishing this is the
[1:12:36] finish of everything what you're
[1:12:38] watching on your news is the finishing
[1:12:40] of everything under the seventh seal
[1:12:44] we're not waiting for it to start but it
[1:12:47] started friends it started at the
[1:12:49] preaching of the thunders
[1:12:52] i showed the opening of the seal
[1:12:59] sometimes i just don't know how to
[1:13:01] preach it
[1:13:03] like
[1:13:04] it's so
[1:13:08] it's so simple
[1:13:11] with revelation
[1:13:13] it's so complicated with information
[1:13:18] i don't know how else to say it
[1:13:22] it's so simple
[1:13:24] with revelation you just see it
[1:13:27] but when you take the information
[1:13:31] it becomes complicated
[1:13:34] i hope that doesn't stumble you
[1:13:37] but it's done that way on purpose
[1:13:43] the seventh seal brings him back to
[1:13:44] earth
[1:13:47] god said in exodus i've come down
[1:13:52] when god come to deliver the children of
[1:13:54] israel
[1:13:55] they didn't see him
[1:13:57] they saw his representative
[1:14:02] brother branham says in the message the
[1:14:04] trial
[1:14:06] to the jews
[1:14:08] he was the son of david
[1:14:10] to the creeks he was the lord the greeks
[1:14:12] he was the lord to us he's the lord to
[1:14:14] the gentiles and now in the last days he
[1:14:16] will return back again a son of man
[1:14:18] because malachi promised that there
[1:14:20] would be a prophet rise up in the last
[1:14:22] days that would return the hearts of the
[1:14:23] people back
[1:14:25] away from the organizations back to the
[1:14:26] original word the faith of the father
[1:14:28] was the original pentecost and when he
[1:14:30] did it saint john 14 12 the works that
[1:14:33] he did would be done also revelation 10
[1:14:36] promised a whole mystery
[1:14:38] how are you going to reveal the mystery
[1:14:40] see what luther left off see what wesley
[1:14:42] left off see what pentecost left off and
[1:14:44] reveal the secrets of a heart to make
[1:14:45] the same god through every age which is
[1:14:48] nothing but god's word being made
[1:14:50] manifest back to the son of man again
[1:14:52] we don't look for nail scars
[1:14:57] we look for the word made manifest
[1:15:03] i don't know what they were looking for
[1:15:04] in israel
[1:15:06] but they were confused by what they saw
[1:15:10] they didn't quite understand their
[1:15:12] murmurings their complainings their
[1:15:14] reactions to moses proved that they
[1:15:16] didn't understand what they were seeing
[1:15:18] because moses now was holding the
[1:15:20] mystery
[1:15:21] of the fulfillment of the word for that
[1:15:23] hour
[1:15:25] he had been to the attraction on the
[1:15:27] mountain
[1:15:28] he had heard the voice of god
[1:15:30] he knew the commission in the hour and
[1:15:32] the time he knew who he was
[1:15:35] and he began to move forward with that
[1:15:37] understanding
[1:15:41] but this is where
[1:15:44] i'm not so normal now
[1:15:47] i begin to meditate and i begin to think
[1:15:49] moses
[1:15:51] his the phenomena that caught his
[1:15:53] attention
[1:15:55] was for him only
[1:15:57] nobody else saw it
[1:16:00] is that true
[1:16:02] he was the only one who saw it it was
[1:16:04] only for him and so many things took
[1:16:08] place to prophets and to individuals and
[1:16:11] the phenomena was to them only and they
[1:16:13] were the only ones who'd seen it others
[1:16:15] could see the effect of it but they
[1:16:16] couldn't see it because there was no
[1:16:18] mechanical eye of a camera to take the
[1:16:20] picture of the phenomenon that day but
[1:16:22] brother branham said in this day he says
[1:16:25] science took the picture not us
[1:16:28] they saw it not us
[1:16:30] and i i started to ask myself the
[1:16:32] question
[1:16:33] why
[1:16:34] in this day
[1:16:35] is there a picture that every one of us
[1:16:38] can hold up and turn to the right and
[1:16:40] look at the capstone and see seven
[1:16:42] angels and they're making up a wig of
[1:16:44] christ and turn it how come you can hold
[1:16:46] a picture like this and do like this and
[1:16:48] say ah i think i see this and look at
[1:16:50] that and those look like wings and
[1:16:56] you see
[1:16:59] moses's attraction was from moses
[1:17:04] i think brother brown's attraction was
[1:17:06] for more than just brother branham
[1:17:10] well you know i mean just science
[1:17:12] evolved and technology come on and now
[1:17:14] we have cameras and it's just it's just
[1:17:16] happenstance that we got a picture of it
[1:17:19] no it's absolutely perfect in the will
[1:17:21] of god
[1:17:22] that now this phenomenon this attraction
[1:17:24] on the mountain is not something that
[1:17:26] takes place privately on the backside of
[1:17:28] the desert nobody else can see it but
[1:17:30] now not only did somebody take pictures
[1:17:32] they took hundreds of pictures
[1:17:34] and not only did a few people notice
[1:17:36] that everybody noticed it it created
[1:17:38] quite a stir there was articles in the
[1:17:40] paper about it now there was a scientist
[1:17:42] who studied atmospheric meteorology and
[1:17:45] he stands outside and looks at it
[1:17:49] and he puts an ad in the paper calling
[1:17:51] for pictures to come together so he can
[1:17:53] analyze this and he begins to describe
[1:17:54] it and it makes such a roar it's so
[1:17:57] unusual that life magazine
[1:18:02] not vanity fair
[1:18:04] because this isn't vanity
[1:18:08] not time because this is eternity amen
[1:18:11] it's life magazine friends life magazine
[1:18:14] god is not dull amen god is not weak god
[1:18:17] is not hoping something works out and
[1:18:19] somebody gets it right but this is in
[1:18:21] life magazine because this is life
[1:18:23] coming down
[1:18:25] this is this is the giver of life this
[1:18:27] is eternal life breaking forth this is
[1:18:29] the opening of the seventh seal the end
[1:18:32] of time seal to bring us into a rapture
[1:18:34] to bring us back to the right kind of
[1:18:36] life
[1:18:38] and this doesn't happen amen so and and
[1:18:40] just somebody says well this is what i
[1:18:42] saw we have to hear it and repeat it and
[1:18:44] read it read it in the book god gave it
[1:18:46] to you and put it in your hand and he
[1:18:47] showed you an attraction on the mountain
[1:18:49] and i think god is sitting here watching
[1:18:51] to see what you do with the attraction
[1:18:53] on the mountain
[1:18:54] this is a different day amen this isn't
[1:18:57] this isn't just for that one man that
[1:18:59] one man when he got caught into that
[1:19:01] constellation he represented the entire
[1:19:03] church
[1:19:03] [Applause]
[1:19:06] the prophet of god was representing you
[1:19:08] and i amen he was getting caught up in a
[1:19:10] rapture he was meeting the lord in the
[1:19:12] air
[1:19:14] i hope you can see that
[1:19:17] because who was up there he said it's
[1:19:18] our lord up there he turned to the right
[1:19:20] said it's our lord up there where did he
[1:19:23] go he went up there where did he go he
[1:19:26] met him in the air
[1:19:30] and brother brennan said all the way
[1:19:32] back in 1961 when he was preaching
[1:19:34] revelation chapter four he was referring
[1:19:36] to john in chapter four getting caught
[1:19:38] up and he said in the vision one man can
[1:19:40] represent the entire church
[1:19:43] and there even a man in this time get
[1:19:45] caught up in this constellation and come
[1:19:47] out as the mystery that was in that
[1:19:49] constellation
[1:19:51] the seventh seal
[1:19:56] and god wasn't going to do like he did
[1:19:58] in moses day this time
[1:20:02] now
[1:20:03] we know christ come down
[1:20:05] because he's the only one who could open
[1:20:07] the seals
[1:20:08] he's the one with the book in his hand
[1:20:10] he's the only one that can give the
[1:20:11] revelation
[1:20:14] and seven thunders uttered their voices
[1:20:17] because the seven thunders sealed and
[1:20:20] the silence and the seventh seal are
[1:20:23] connected together brother and i said
[1:20:25] they're the same thing
[1:20:27] so when brother brennan began to preach
[1:20:28] those thunders night after night what he
[1:20:30] was doing he was revealing the silence
[1:20:33] under the seventh seal showing
[1:20:35] that this is the time
[1:20:37] for the opening of the seventh seal
[1:20:42] and then god puts this attraction on
[1:20:43] this board and on the paper you can have
[1:20:46] in a
[1:20:47] poster on the wall and a picture that
[1:20:49] you can hang
[1:20:52] and you can see that attraction
[1:20:56] you can look up there
[1:20:58] and you can say oh i wish the kids would
[1:21:00] listen to me and i wish i had a better
[1:21:01] job and i wish these goats weren't so
[1:21:03] hard to chase around this back side of
[1:21:05] the desert
[1:21:08] god put the attraction there for a
[1:21:10] reason he sent it around the world he's
[1:21:12] printed it on all kinds of forms he's
[1:21:14] got it in front of our face all the time
[1:21:16] what is it he set the attraction up just
[1:21:18] like he did to moses in that day he got
[1:21:21] something to attract his attention and
[1:21:22] he was watching
[1:21:25] is that what the bible tells us he was
[1:21:28] watching because the scripture says when
[1:21:30] he saw that moses drew near he spoke to
[1:21:33] him
[1:21:34] he was watching for moses to draw near
[1:21:38] i mean this is a the language in itself
[1:21:41] is amazing
[1:21:43] the way it's worded is for a purpose he
[1:21:46] he set the bush i mean the angel is
[1:21:48] there the pillar of fire is burning the
[1:21:50] bush amen and moses is going it's going
[1:21:53] to attract his attention and he's just
[1:21:55] going about his daily business he's just
[1:21:56] doing what he's always done
[1:21:59] he's got all the same problems he had
[1:22:00] the day before he may have got a new
[1:22:02] problem that morning who knows what he's
[1:22:04] going through who knows what he's
[1:22:05] thinking
[1:22:08] but in the day when he didn't expect it
[1:22:09] at a time when he wasn't looking for it
[1:22:11] amen there was a pillar of fire there
[1:22:13] that was going to reveal that the lord
[1:22:15] had come down and was going to fulfill
[1:22:16] this promise that he had a question
[1:22:18] about
[1:22:21] and god was watching
[1:22:26] and when the lord saw
[1:22:29] that he drew near to the bush
[1:22:32] he spoke to him
[1:22:36] he began to reveal to him
[1:22:39] the day
[1:22:40] in its message
[1:22:42] he began to reveal to him the purpose of
[1:22:44] the sign
[1:22:46] he began to reveal to him what his
[1:22:48] purpose was in all of this
[1:22:54] and you and i
[1:22:55] go through life
[1:22:57] doing what we do
[1:22:59] before we come to the message we did
[1:23:00] what we did we we lived what we lived we
[1:23:02] do what we do
[1:23:05] but god had an attraction on the
[1:23:07] mountain
[1:23:09] that wasn't just going to be seen by one
[1:23:11] man
[1:23:13] that was going to be seen by the whole
[1:23:14] world
[1:23:16] and god was watching to see who would
[1:23:18] draw near the attraction
[1:23:24] who would draw near to this attraction
[1:23:28] and when god watched to see who would
[1:23:30] draw near when he saw you and i draw
[1:23:33] near to the attraction
[1:23:34] he began to speak out of the attraction
[1:23:36] and he began to tell us the day the hour
[1:23:39] that we live in the message of the hour
[1:23:41] who's here who's come down to deliver
[1:23:43] who's fulfilling the word and what our
[1:23:45] purpose is
[1:23:48] because once you come in contact with
[1:23:50] the attraction and find out who's here
[1:23:52] and what the hour is and what seal is
[1:23:54] being broke amen you become the mystery
[1:23:57] in the seal you become the mystery in
[1:24:00] the pyramid you've been caught up into
[1:24:02] the mind of christ by revelation brother
[1:24:04] branham represented it but you and i
[1:24:06] have to go there each one to be caught
[1:24:08] up to meet him in the revelation of what
[1:24:11] this sign represents
[1:24:13] and when we draw near because of the
[1:24:16] attraction amen god speaks out of the
[1:24:18] attraction
[1:24:22] i wonder what he says
[1:24:24] this is just brother chad this is just
[1:24:26] me but to me he says i have come down to
[1:24:30] fulfill my word in this hour and i'm
[1:24:32] sending you into the world to represent
[1:24:35] that this seal is open that i'm alive
[1:24:38] i'm back in the church again and it's
[1:24:40] time for me to reveal the further part
[1:24:42] of my mystery the part that wasn't it
[1:24:44] wasn't easily uh seen amen
[1:24:48] the part that was mysterious through
[1:24:50] seven church ages that i had a bride
[1:24:52] amen that there was a female part of me
[1:24:54] to come into expression
[1:24:58] there was an attraction were you
[1:25:00] attracted by the attraction are you
[1:25:02] attracted by the attraction or do you
[1:25:04] see and say that's a cloud
[1:25:08] do you see it say well some people doubt
[1:25:10] it some people say this some people say
[1:25:12] that
[1:25:13] who cares what anybody says
[1:25:16] i don't care what anybody says about
[1:25:17] that cloud
[1:25:18] makes no difference to me what anybody
[1:25:20] in the world says about that cloud
[1:25:21] because i've drawn near to the
[1:25:23] attraction it attracted me and god spoke
[1:25:25] out of the attraction and told me what
[1:25:27] day it is what part of the word is being
[1:25:29] fulfilled and what my part is in that
[1:25:32] i may have had all kinds of doubts in
[1:25:33] the past about who i am amen and again
[1:25:36] god used me and if i failed him too much
[1:25:38] and if i if i'd been back on the
[1:25:40] backside of the desert separated from
[1:25:41] the economy of god so long that he now
[1:25:43] can't use me you think moses never had a
[1:25:46] thought like that
[1:25:48] you've had thoughts like that we've all
[1:25:49] had thoughts like that but oh my oh my
[1:25:52] he has an attraction on the mountain and
[1:25:55] he can speak out of the attraction today
[1:26:01] there's a reason it was in life magazine
[1:26:03] there's a reason it's been published
[1:26:04] over and over it's a reason it's still
[1:26:06] distributed all over the place
[1:26:09] it's to attract
[1:26:11] his end-time bride
[1:26:15] god
[1:26:16] allowed that man to represent us getting
[1:26:18] caught up
[1:26:20] into the constellation of angels
[1:26:23] which we found out was the headship of
[1:26:25] christ
[1:26:27] which we found out was the mystery that
[1:26:30] laid in the bible which christ is the
[1:26:32] mystery of god revealed
[1:26:35] he turned it to the right and realized
[1:26:37] who this is
[1:26:39] that's bringing this revelation who this
[1:26:41] is that's come down in this hour who
[1:26:43] this where brother branham was
[1:26:48] and i was represented there
[1:26:54] i was represented in that catching up i
[1:26:56] was represented in that sign
[1:27:00] and now spiritually when i come in
[1:27:02] contact with this sign again
[1:27:05] i'm caught up
[1:27:08] brother chad
[1:27:11] you got caught up into the constellation
[1:27:13] of angels
[1:27:16] listen
[1:27:17] turn the picture to the right
[1:27:21] turn it to the right
[1:27:24] i want to ask you have you united with
[1:27:25] christ in this hour
[1:27:27] have you connected with the headship
[1:27:29] if you have connected with the headship
[1:27:31] you got caught up into that
[1:27:32] constellation because that's the
[1:27:33] headship of christ
[1:27:35] you've entered into the mind of christ
[1:27:36] at the revealing of the word when god
[1:27:38] revealed it personally to you you went
[1:27:40] into that cloud
[1:27:42] your feet may not have left the ground
[1:27:44] you may not have a picture of you on the
[1:27:46] inside of it but if you've been
[1:27:47] connected to christ in this hour if the
[1:27:49] headship has come to you if you've
[1:27:51] entered into an invisible you with
[1:27:52] christ you've been in that cloud
[1:27:55] you've been connected to him
[1:28:02] all of these things are abstract all of
[1:28:04] these things are intangible all these
[1:28:07] things
[1:28:08] i can't help that
[1:28:11] i can't help it that we can't make it uh
[1:28:14] a creed that we repeat we can't make it
[1:28:17] a lesson that we learn we can't make it
[1:28:19] a church that we attend we can't make it
[1:28:21] a statement that we say we can't make it
[1:28:23] anything other than it is it's the
[1:28:25] revelation of the hour
[1:28:26] it's the coming of the lord it's the
[1:28:28] opening of the seventh seal it's the
[1:28:29] uniting of the bride in christ amen and
[1:28:32] it takes place spiritually but because
[1:28:34] it's spiritually it doesn't mean it's
[1:28:35] not real doesn't mean it's not physical
[1:28:37] doesn't mean it's not literal
[1:28:40] we get so stuck carnal we're so carnal
[1:28:44] that we have to touch we've got to touch
[1:28:45] something like this this is real i'm
[1:28:47] telling you this is not real but what is
[1:28:49] spiritual is more real than this
[1:28:52] your life is called a vapor just a mist
[1:28:54] this world is not what's tangible the
[1:28:57] other side is more real than this
[1:29:01] but we get so carnal and so earthy that
[1:29:04] we've got to see nail scars we've got to
[1:29:06] see a physical form we've got to be like
[1:29:09] the children were in egypt when god come
[1:29:11] down to deliver them they wouldn't even
[1:29:12] receive their deliverance
[1:29:16] so carnal
[1:29:19] so carnal it's got to be physical it's
[1:29:21] got to be understandable it's got to you
[1:29:23] know one thing has to go first and the
[1:29:25] next thing comes next and then we add
[1:29:28] this and it doesn't work logically
[1:29:31] [Applause]
[1:29:33] revelation doesn't work logically
[1:29:38] the mind of man
[1:29:43] i hope i'm not scaring you i can't i
[1:29:45] can't help but preach what god has given
[1:29:47] me to preach i can't help but share it
[1:29:49] the way it's real in my heart amen it's
[1:29:51] not it's not a it's not a graph it's not
[1:29:54] a chart it's not all the pieces of
[1:29:57] information put together so tight that
[1:29:59] everybody can see it no it's coming in
[1:30:02] contact with the attraction on the
[1:30:03] amount and let the attraction speak to
[1:30:05] you
[1:30:08] what's the attraction
[1:30:11] is it a cloud
[1:30:13] is it a picture
[1:30:15] is it a message novelty
[1:30:20] is it
[1:30:21] a witnessing card
[1:30:26] to me
[1:30:28] to me
[1:30:29] it's the attraction on the mountain
[1:30:33] it's the recognition
[1:30:36] of my day and its message
[1:30:39] it's the recognition
[1:30:41] of the time of the end time seal to come
[1:30:43] open
[1:30:45] the reality
[1:30:49] i don't know how else to say it
[1:30:52] it's more real than anything we've ever
[1:30:55] touched
[1:30:56] tasted
[1:30:58] felt
[1:30:59] stood upon
[1:31:03] it's
[1:31:04] this message is not
[1:31:06] a bunch of words this message is not
[1:31:08] tapes
[1:31:09] this message is christ
[1:31:13] it was him coming
[1:31:14] to open the seals it was him coming to
[1:31:17] reveal the mystery that was laying in
[1:31:19] the bible it was him amen that was
[1:31:21] giving those seven thunders he was just
[1:31:23] using a vessel
[1:31:26] but just as sure today it's him in the
[1:31:29] revelation of the seventh seal it's him
[1:31:31] amen christ in bright form it's him just
[1:31:34] as real as he ever was he's here but
[1:31:37] he's working in vessels again
[1:31:41] he's working in vessels who've got
[1:31:43] caught up into the reality of the
[1:31:45] revelation
[1:31:46] who've been caught up into the headship
[1:31:48] to the mind of christ
[1:31:50] and been got up into the constellation
[1:31:53] of the angels into the pyramid that
[1:31:55] contains the mysteries within themselves
[1:32:00] and they've come back out
[1:32:03] and now the mystery is in them
[1:32:06] now they're part of the mystery
[1:32:12] see
[1:32:15] elijah
[1:32:16] was given a commission
[1:32:20] and elijah goes to fulfill that
[1:32:22] commission but elijah doesn't finish the
[1:32:24] commission elisha finishes the
[1:32:26] commission
[1:32:28] and we live in this day where god amen
[1:32:30] took the prophet off the scene because
[1:32:32] the elisha the bride has got to finish
[1:32:35] this commission
[1:32:38] she has got to finish this revelation of
[1:32:40] the mystery she has to live
[1:32:42] this revelation of the mystery
[1:32:45] she has to be him
[1:32:47] it has to be him revealed in her
[1:32:51] it's got to be
[1:32:52] more it's got to be more than a picture
[1:32:57] it's got to be more well i've seen that
[1:32:59] all my life
[1:33:00] well you're more blessed than
[1:33:02] generations and generations that have
[1:33:04] been upon this earth
[1:33:07] let's not go through life
[1:33:10] so busy in our minds and so preoccupied
[1:33:13] with life that we walk by the sign and
[1:33:16] say yeah i know what that is
[1:33:20] that was so tied up and so busy and so
[1:33:23] worn out and you're like yeah i they
[1:33:25] preach on that all the time i know what
[1:33:26] that is
[1:33:28] oh it's got to be more than that friends
[1:33:32] it's got to be not a picture in your
[1:33:33] wallet not a picture on your wall but
[1:33:35] it's got to be something that that has
[1:33:37] happened to you an attraction that has
[1:33:39] attracted you
[1:33:42] and you've been caught up in it
[1:33:44] and god has spoke to you and revealed to
[1:33:46] you the hour that we live in
[1:33:48] and now you're the walking part of this
[1:33:50] mystery
[1:33:52] you've been there
[1:33:54] you've been united with that headship
[1:33:56] now i'm here on this earth not like i
[1:33:58] was before
[1:34:00] because brother bam said after the
[1:34:01] opening of the seals he goes i can never
[1:34:03] think the same again
[1:34:05] the bible has become a new book to me
[1:34:08] once you've come in contact with the
[1:34:10] headship of christ in the revelation of
[1:34:12] the hour amen you can never think the
[1:34:15] same again
[1:34:18] just as different
[1:34:21] let the attraction
[1:34:22] be an attraction
[1:34:25] if god sets before his attraction let's
[1:34:28] draw near to the attraction
[1:34:31] and when he sees us drawing near to the
[1:34:33] attraction may he speak to us
[1:34:37] out of the attraction
[1:34:39] let's all stand brother ben if you and
[1:34:41] the musicians could come
[1:34:44] oh i just want to say i love you
[1:34:47] i love you i wish
[1:34:49] i wish that i could take it from in here
[1:34:51] and stick it right inside
[1:34:54] but god chose to use the foolishness of
[1:34:55] preaching
[1:34:57] because he's got a powerful mechanism
[1:34:58] called revelation
[1:35:01] and god is only going to allow it by the
[1:35:03] powerful force of revelation
[1:35:06] and he's not going to let man
[1:35:08] ruin this thing he's not going to let
[1:35:10] man man handle it he's going to let us
[1:35:12] preach it in weakness with limited
[1:35:14] language with the best we can but still
[1:35:17] with many holes in many gaps because
[1:35:18] he's got a mechanism called revelation
[1:35:22] and he can bring the reality of it to us
[1:35:26] let's just bow our heads and pray lord
[1:35:27] jesus we thank you
[1:35:31] god i thank you that there was a time
[1:35:32] that you attracted me lord
[1:35:36] and you knew how to attract me because
[1:35:37] you put something inside of me that
[1:35:39] would be attracted
[1:35:41] to this manifestation
[1:35:43] you pre-arranged it you pre-programmed
[1:35:45] me
[1:35:46] but oh god how thankful i am
[1:35:49] that when i saw the cloud lord i wasn't
[1:35:52] like millions of others
[1:35:54] who said that's a cloud or that's an
[1:35:56] unusual cloud
[1:35:58] but god as i began to draw near to the
[1:36:00] cloud you spoke to me out of this
[1:36:03] revelation
[1:36:04] you told me who i am and who you are
[1:36:07] told me that you're here to fulfill your
[1:36:10] word
[1:36:12] god it means more to me than life
[1:36:15] i pray that you'd bring this revelation
[1:36:17] to your bride lord
[1:36:19] god i
[1:36:20] i've done all that i know to do
[1:36:23] the best that i could do and it wasn't
[1:36:26] man's efforts are always feeble lord i
[1:36:28] know that
[1:36:29] but god this is how you've led me this
[1:36:31] is what i've done according to what
[1:36:32] you've led me to do and i'm praying that
[1:36:34] you would do the part that no human
[1:36:36] being can do
[1:36:37] i pray that you would unlock revelation
[1:36:39] in the hearts and lives of your people
[1:36:41] lord those that have come close to the
[1:36:43] attraction today the attraction on the
[1:36:45] mountain now lord they've seen it
[1:36:47] they've come face to face let them not
[1:36:49] walk by it lord let them not move away
[1:36:51] and say it's too complicated i don't
[1:36:53] understand but let them draw near lord
[1:36:55] and as they draw near i pray you'd speak
[1:36:57] to them
[1:36:58] out of the attraction
[1:37:00] reveal to them who they are
[1:37:03] the hour that they live
[1:37:05] the word is to be manifest that you're
[1:37:07] here to bring it to pass
[1:37:09] we love you god and we ask you would
[1:37:11] just help us more
[1:37:13] i pray that you bless this assembly lord

[1:37:19] to oregon i pray you would anoint me for
[1:37:21] the services there that your people
[1:37:22] would be blessed there

[1:37:32] hour
[1:37:33] lord according to your will may you
[1:37:34] bring us back lord for a great union a
[1:37:37] reunion and that we might share
[1:37:39] testimonies and fellowship together
[1:37:42] god i commit this congregation to your
[1:37:44] hands i commit myself into your hands
[1:37:46] i thank you for what you've done in this
[1:37:48] hour i thank you for the revelation in
[1:37:51] my life
[1:37:52] i pray that you'd help it to grow lord
