[Music] is [Music] [Music] praise the lord let's just pray together precious lord jesus we just want to pause here for a moment lord and approach you by way of prayer lord to thank you for this opportunity once again that you've provided to us lord that we could gather and assemble ourselves together around your revealed word lord and to come and to worship you in spirit and in truth and lord i pray that as we would come to this juncture in the service that you would come now father lord as we so often say but it's every time true lord there is not a mortal man that can stand here and do the task that is at hand father for only the lamb can break the seals lord and only you can feed your sheep father so he would ask that you would come now and that you would supernaturally do what you've preordained for this service to do father we just yield ourselves to you both speaker and here in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen god bless you if you have your bibles we'll go to revelation chapter four i appreciate the song that we just sang there very fitting for where i want to go here through an open door so we want to go through that door and we want to close that door revelation chapter 4 very familiar portion of scripture here and it says after this i looked brother branham said after what after the church ages after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee the things which must be hereafter let's turn to revelation chapter 10. also very familiar here revelation chapter 10 verse 1 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was up on his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth and he cried with the loud voices when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices so we have an open door and we have an open book let's turn to matthew 23 for our last scripture reading matthew 23 and verse 12. matthew 23 and 12 and it says whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in god bless you as you would have your seats so we can see here that we have an open door we have an open book but in matthew 23 we have a group of people that wants to shut that up so god himself is opening the door god himself is opening a book but man is trying to shut this and we obviously know that that can't be pleasing to god because what god wants to open he does not want a man to shut i want to look at a topic here this evening of going around moab and i think that will make more sense to you as we progress here going around moab turn to numbers chapter 20. numbers chapter 20. this is dealing with israel after they have left egypt they are on their way to the promised land but for just prior to coming to the promised land to going over into canaan to crossing jordan and going over into canaan they come up against two countries and that's moab and edom and they stack right on top of one another moab is just north edom is just south and soon as you cross through them then you're into canaan land where they were headed to but in numbers chapter 20 verse 14 it says and moses sent messengers from kadesh unto the king of edom now this portion here just says edom it doesn't say anything about moab but we'll get the second portion in judges he's dealing with both countries here thus saith thy brother israel thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us how our fathers went down into egypt and we have dwelt in egypt a long time and the egyptians vexed us and our fathers and when we cried into the lord we heard his voice and he sent an angel and hath brought us forth out of egypt and behold we are in kadesh a city in the uttermost of thy border let us pass i pray thee through thy country we will not pass through the fields or through the vineyards neither will we drink of the water of the wells we will go by the king's highway we will not turn to the right nor to the left until we have passed thy borders and edom said unto him thou shalt not pass by me lest i come out against thee with the sword so not only is he not going to let him pass by but he will use the word against him if need be and the children of israel said unto him we will go by the highway and if i and my cattle drink of thy water then i will pay for it i will only without doing anything else go through on my feet and he said thou shalt not go through and edom came out against him with much people and with a strong hand thus edom refused israel to give israel passage through his border wherefore israel turned away from him judges 11 verse 16 you don't have to go there because it's basically giving the same recount here but i want to read this to you judges 11 but when israel came up from egypt and walked through the wilderness under the red sea and came to kadesh then israel sent messengers under the king of edom saying let me operate thee pass through thy land but the king of edom would not hearken there unto and in like manner they sent unto the king of moab but he would not consent an israel abode in kadush then they went along through the wilderness and compassed the land of eno and the land of moab and came by the east side of the land of moab that's just a fancy way of saying that they went around those two countries and pitched on the other side of arnon but came not within the border of moab for arnon was the border of moab so israel has been supernaturally delivered the scripture says by an angel to lead them out of egypt we know that angel by the name of moses but israel as an as a natural nation has supernaturally been delivered from the nation of uh egypt they have been given a direction by god of where to go and on their way there right before they get there they come against these two countries which they refer to as brothers and this is factually correct because we know that moab came from lot which was abraham's nephew israel's abraham's seed we know that edom came from esau so this is factual this is literally relatives and they have come to them and they said god has supernaturally moved in our life he has picked us up he has put us here and he has told us to go right here but in order to do that we simply need to walk through your country we don't want anything we're not asking you to support us anything god forbid that we would damage or that we would take or we uh would use as we would be going through inadvertently we'll pay for it we'll compensate you for it we just asked you let us pass through and now their relatives their family not only says no not only let me back up they not only won't support them family they not only won't support them but they says they say no you will not even walk through here you will not even come through our countries and farther more so they won't support them they won't allow them passage but furthermore if you even try we will come out against you with the sword so now they're going to slay they're going to fight and slay their own relatives over simple passage over simply walking through somewhere without even taking anything without even asking for anything but if you try to walk this way we will come out against you with the sword earnestly continuing for the faith 1953 brother branham says if you'll notice for a few minutes look at israel in the wilderness and was getting ready to cross moab wouldn't let them cross the country now moab was believers the moabites you know who it was the generation that came from lot's daughter where they lived with their father and the oldest one went over and the land of moab came from him in the church age book brother ram says the moabites knew the truth whether they lived up to it or not they knew the truth whether they lived up to it or not does this sound like somebody that you know does this sound like somebody that you may know maybe somebody you have to deal with on a daily basis maybe somebody you look at in the mirror that you tell the truth to over and over and over it knows the truth but it fails to walk in it and you constantly have to bring it back into subjection don't put it farther away than it needs to be don't put it farther away than the person sitting in your pew in your chair new knows the truth constantly knows the truth it's constantly being subjected to the word your hybrid spirit and your hybrid flesh flesh constantly being subjected to the word always fails to walk in it if it if you give it its free choice if you give it its free reign and you don't constantly bring it into subjection it's not going to do it voluntarily furthermore it will not support you if you walk that way your hybrid spirit and your hybrid flesh is not going to support you and furthermore it is not going to allow you to do it freely it is not going to support you it is not going to encourage you and it's not going to do it on its own free will and if it sees that you're making progress in that way it will come out against you and it will fight you tooth and toenail as they say or maybe that's just me maybe i'm the only one but what a paradox so to speak that you have a supernatural move of god undeniable supernatural move of god to the point that they testify it testify about it they say we've heard of you all we've heard of what this god can do but we're not going to support it and you're not coming through here and if you try we're going to kill you your your spirit and your flesh are witnesses of what god has done in your soul it is undeniable it is constantly being subjected to that it knows the reality of that but it just won't let you walk through 1947 the children of israel brother random says now she moves on speaking of israel and finally they came down through the land of moab there and the king balak he thought he would be wiped out so now brother branham is going into the mind into the spirit of this king of moab and he's starting to deal with what was really motivating him what was really uh what he was really basing his decisions off of and he's catching the spirit that he's operating under and he says that the reason that he won't support them the reason that he told him they can't come through the reason that he says i will come out against you with the sword if you try as he said he thought he would be wiped out self preservation and he said oh this great company here that's like will lick us up like the ox licks the grass up off of the earth it's going to be wiped out your hybridization is going to be wiped out but it's a concern to it that's why brother branham says he he goes into the spiritual and he picks this out and he says this is why remember we're taught what happened naturally in israel happens spiritually to the bride and this is this is the stage of the battle just before they cross over just prior to going into the promised land this is what starts taking place 1953 earnestly continued for the faith now balak rather the king of moab he was not an infidel he was a believer sure he was and balab wasn't an infidel the prophet he was a believer here's two sets of believers them same spirits like cain and abel they come right down now again now notice here was a man the king of moab he said come down and curse this people believers cursing believers remember this is just prior to entrance to the promised land somebody thinking they're going to be wiped out and believers cursing believers these believers up here are jealous of these believers he's saying moab is jealous of israel why because god is with those believers that's the reason so moab again they they know that god is with this group of people they know what's going they can see what has happened to the people that have confronted israel and the circumstances that have confronted israel as they have been on this journey and now they come right up to the gates of moab and moabs can see the history your spirit and your flesh can see the history they know what's coming but they're not it's not going to roll over and just give it to you it says that it's jealous this spirit is jealous because it can clearly see that god is with this believer so he says now he goes and he gets a fallen prophet to come and to curse these true believers 1954 the end time he says moab sent over to an old backslidden prophet over there said come over and curse israel could you imagine both of them believing in the same god one wanting to curse the other he's jealous of him them men died but that spirit still lives could you imagine he asks could you imagine could you imagine surely that wouldn't happen now in 2021 surely those spirits are gone now believers cursing believers using a false prophet a false ministry to curse believers he's jealous of him them men died but that spirit lives on 1962 in fellowship brother branham says remember when israel came up from egypt moab met him and wouldn't let him have a revival in his land look how brother branham is breaking down the spirits that motivated the decisions moab don't want to be wiped out jealous of them and he says they he did not want them to have a revival in his land there was no cooperation and moab believed that the same god that israel believed in they went and got their bishop down there balak uh he means balaam he said balak but that's okay brought him down there and he was just as fundamental as israel was moab failed to see that pillar of fire going before them they failed to see that brass serpent and that smitten rock following them although israel had done wrong moab failed to see the pillar of fire they failed to see the smit the brass serpent they failed to see that smitten rock pillar of brass serpent smitten rock moving objects remember moab was a nation brother ram said it was a nation established had borders was not moving i would dare to say that they were no longer reaching out in the spirit but now here comes a people here comes a nation that does not have borders a nation that's simply going somewhere god told them to go a nation simply trying to get through an open door a nation simply trying to go through an open book and there's a pillar of fire and a brass serpent and a smitten rock moving objects that's following them and the carnal believer moab is jealous and he's concerned and he don't want to be wiped out so he starts cursing the true believer you would think at some point in time if you could recognize this much look what god did for these people look what's following them we know we'll be wiped out if they confront us you would think at some point you would kind of go back to that old cliche if you can't beat them join them but the spirit can't that spirit can't remember this is a spirit that can look into the face of god that can look into the face of god and says and say your judgment is too harsh on me i just slayed my brother but you can't do that to me it's too harsh what a spirit how brash how bold remember brother brown said spirits don't die and it comes to the point that spirits won't even subject himself to common sense they can recognize what's going on but they still can't just leave it alone they still just can't move out of the way and let somebody walk through they have to resist it in their church age book brother branham says another illustration that we might take is this story of israel leaving egypt for canaan land god's purpose in this age was to bring israel out and take them in to the end that they might serve him thus when they left egypt they all came out from under the blood of the sacrificial lamb they all went through the waters of baptism in the red sea they all enjoyed the mighty miracles all eight of the manna all drank of the rock and insofar as obvious external blessings and manifestations were concerned they all partook in like an equal manner but when they came to moab those who joined in the fels the feast of bel pior all died their carcasses fell in the wilderness for it was there that they refused the word of god and turned from it now this is what hebrews 6 1-9 speaks of you cannot just go along with part of the word you have to take all of the word so excuse me brother branham now draws an equal sign between hebrews 6 6 1 through 9 and what happened at bel peor hebrew 6 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection leaving the doctrine of the principles of christ i'm sorry leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us now go on to perfection you won't get to perfection unless you go through an open door and you're eating out of an open book let us go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith towards god of the doctrine of baptism and laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment let us not let let us not tie up all the loose ends again we've got the loose ends they're tied up we appreciate the loose sins but let's now go to perfection let's now let the lamb come and take the book and loose the seals let's now have the fullness of revelation not partiality let's not seek the gifts but the giver of the gifts let's seek him and this we will do paul speaking still and this we will do if god permit for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance brother branham remember is drawing an equal sign between israel at bel peor and what they did in hebrews 6 if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucified themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh off to upon it and bringeth forth herbs meant for them whom in distress re receiveth blessing from god for that which beareth thorns and briars is rejected and is nigh into cursing whose end is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded of better things for you better things better than what better than what leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ of the doctrine of baptism laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment we are persuaded of more of you than tying up the lucians we are persuaded of better things we are persuaded of perfection for you but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation these accompany salvation though we thus speak in the church age book brother branham says so israel came up to the borders of moab and sent messengers to the king saying we are brothers let us pass through your land if our people or our animals eat or drink anything we will gladly pay for it but king balak got very excited that head of the nicolaitan bunch was not about to let that church come through with its signs and its wonders and diverse manifestations of the holy ghost with their faces shining with the glory of god he recognizes what's happening here and he says if they come through i'm going to be wiped out if they come through if they come through i must kill them with the sword he says it was too risky as he might lose some of his crowd they just want to walk through they just want to read the open book they just want to go through the open door out of the church ages and have the fullness of christ and the spirit says it's too risky if i allow them to do that it might affect my group so i now must take the same word the sword of the word and slay them with it brother random says can you imagine believers fighting believers it was too risky as he might lose some of his crowd so balak refused to let israel pass through in fact so great was his fear of them that he went to a hiring prophet called balaam you'll notice brother branham rooted out the cause there his fear of them if he really knew he was okay why is he fearing this people it's so simple but it's so profound look at all the downfall look at all the downfall and the things that he would do instead of just getting himself right with god and taking away the fear he has to go and do all of this spirits don't die in fact so great was his fear of them that he went to a hiring prophet called balaam and asked him to meditate between him and god and petition the almighty to curse israel and to render them in potent and balaam being eager to take part in political affairs and become a great man was only too glad to do it now isn't that just like the nicolaitans we have with us today they curse everyone that won't go their way instead of just dealing with the real cause instead of just instead of your spirit and your flesh humbling itself and realizing it's a mess to begin with and the end is going to be the end it's already been spoken it's going to be done instead of just allowing the word to flow through it it says no i must resist i must not be overcome by this i must kill this power in this life and this source that is that is trying to flow through me it will not just roll over it will not allow free passage but it will struggle and it will fight even when it doesn't make good sense instead of just recognizing instead of just recognizing that if this is allowed if preeminence is allowed why should i fear see it's not your your 16 elements that's concerned about this because remember brother branham says the same 16 elements that you're made out of is what's going to be redeemed you're not going to get a new body you're going to get a redeemed body there's only one thing that's going to leave your body and that's hybridization but it's not just going to leave it's going to have to be went around because if you're wanting to manifest the fullness of the word i'm really getting ahead of myself here but okay if you're really wanting to manifest the fullness of the word in your body you can't kill your body correct you can't demonstrate christ on earth the mystery of god revealed you cannot demonstrate that here on earth if you go out because you're upset with your body it's not obeying what your soul is telling it to do and you hang yourself on a tree now you do not have a body to manifest through you're in another dimension understood but this was the orders that was given to israel even before they confronted them god told him do not fight with moab that's family leave him alone you can't fight with edom it's family leave him alone see if you got rid of your human spirit even though it's hybrid if you got rid of your human spirit what are you going to be remember what happened to nebuchadnezzar god took the spirit of a man out of him put a spirit of an animal in him and he became and started acting like an animal to the point that his body's atoms physically started to change so god has already told israel when they start this battle you can't fight with moab you can't fight with edom so now when they come up and they ask for passage through and it's denied they don't have an option they can't take up the sword against their brother think of the principle saints that's why it's so easy to discern what spirit somebody is of if they want to fight against a believer or even if they want to fight against an unbeliever that fighting spirit is of satan period why do i need to fight against an unbeliever i know who i am why god forbid what i need to fight against a believer even if i just think they're a make-believer why do i need to fight against something that fighting spirit is nothing but satan it comes from the kingdom of satan but this is the principle that god laid out to them you can't fight with moab you can't fight with eden because god knows we can't just go destroy our body he's going to redeem it we can't just go and destroy our human spirit brother man says it'll go and be no more god will deal with those at the appropriate time but now our battle is to bypass those we're still going to the open book we're still going through the open door but we have to bypass the desires and the lust of the flesh and the pride of life and our hybrid spirit realm in order to get there each and every day but the principle of this is i want you to recognize how close it is this is not outside the doors this is not on the seat beside you this is in the seat you're sitting in and if you get distracted and you think the fight is somewhere else you're going to lose your battle and you're not going through an open door and you're not going to be eating an open book you are not going to be manifesting the fullness of christ you ha israel had to recognize the battle for where the battle was at and they had to recognize how god told them to fight that battle and what they were allowed to do and what they were not allowed to do he says there are people who seem to be involved in the things of god almost 100 they are like judas no one but jesus knew exactly what kind of a person judas was so the day came that judas did exactly what israel did at bel pior he decided that he wanted to join with the false vine forces to enter into the financial political organization of anti-word antichrist religion and he did so he was fooled the other 11 were not they could not be for they were of the very elect so when judas left and betrayed the lord his name was removed from the book of life now i am sure that you have noticed that those whose names were in the book of life were part of the religious order of that day that centered around the true god and worship of him though they did not worship him according to truth like judas they did not go all the way they did not leave a laodicean condition and get through an open door they did not eat an open book they failed to see the lion come and loose the seals continuing in the in the church age book he says now in spite of the fact that balaam knew the proper approach to god and he could bring forth the rebel revelation from the lord by means of special enduman of power he was still for all of that a bishop in the false group he knew the proper approach to god he could bring forth a revelation from the lord by means of a special enduman of power in spite of all of that he was a bishop in the false group second kings 3 23 and they said let me give you just a little bit of a backstory here this is when the three kings moab comes against the three kings i believe the three kings was jehoshaphat of jude of judah ahab of israel and there was one other and it don't come to mind right now but this is a characteristic of moab so when these three king moab comes against these three kings and when these three kings get together they run out of water they call elijah or elisha on the scene god have mercy on me i can't remember which one it was but they called one of the two on the scene and brother chad just touched on this recently and he he told ahab he says if it wasn't for jehoshaphat i wouldn't even talk to you like that's just the way that it is but remember moab's coming against them and at second king kings 3 23 this is after the ditches were made made with water so the children the true children in the valley that moab is coming against they recognize that god has filled these ditches with water and they're they're drinking of it they're using of it but when moab comes up in a high place above the true believers when moab comes up and he looks down it says 323 and they said moab said this is blood the kings are surely slain and they have smitten one another they fought against each other they couldn't get along with each other they fought against each other they killed each other they're all slain and these ditches all down here it's filled with blood and it says moab to the spoil in other words let's go take everything that they got they fought against each other and they lost everything that they had now we're going to go take it but this is a characteristic of moab in the scripture is moab has a false interpretation of what the blood is they see the they see water in ditches that the true believers are drinking they see water of the word that is sustaining the true believers and the true believers know that it's water but when moab comes up and they look down they say that's not water that's blood and they say moab to the spoil so they can't recognize what is blood and what is water they don't have a proper interpretation there brother branham says 1963 christ is the mystery of god revealed the church is the blood of christ the spirit the church is the blood by the spirit you're not going to go to calvary and dig it up and even if you could even though that would be very precious i would never make a comment against that even though that would be very precious if you could get some dna from that blood one speck of that blood it will still not do you any good now it's been shed the life has went out of it and brother branham says that the church is the blood by the spirit moab can't see this because the life is in the blood that's the baptism of the holy ghost that baptizes us into the body that recognizes only his body his flesh his word further in the rapture he says one day there will come a blast from heaven and the dead in christ shall rise first them old testament saints back yonder who are waiting will blast forth and come out of there first and go into the resurrection will drop right in line going into the skies these old mortal bodies changed and made like unto his own glorious body what a parade that will be when it starts heavenward some of these days in that rapturing time that lays ahead all proudly displaying the blood of jesus christ upon their chest the message of god in the hour that they lived in but moab can't see that they're too busy believing that those people got fighting amongst themselves like we were like the spirit that's upon us they can't see where the blood's at the true believer knew what it was he knew it was the water of the word for the hour that he lived in the blood of jesus christ upon their chest the message of god in the hour that they lived in jeremiah 48 11 continuing with characteristics of moab moab hath been at ease from his youth and he has settled on his lease again i would venture to say that he failed to keep reaching out in the spirit he's been at ease from his youth he's settled on his lease and hath not been emptied from vessel the vessel neither hath he gone into captivity therefore his tastes remain within him and his scent is not changed jeremiah 48 29 he says we have heard of the pride of moab he is exceedingly proud his loftiness and his arrogancy and his pride and the haughtiness of his heart jeremiah 48 42 and moab shall be destroyed from being a people because he hath magnified himself against the lord why does your hybrid spirit have to go and be no more why does the atoms of your body have to be changed it's because it has magnified itself against the word that is in your soul it is exceedingly proudful it must go fear and the pit and the snare shall be upon the o inhabitant of moab saith the lord that's why you can still get bothered in your spirit realm and that's why your flesh can still have diseases because fear and the pit and the snare is all that's promise promised to that realm anything that would resist that word that is in your heart there is nothing good spoke of it i have searched through the scriptures and if i'm wrong somebody come and correct me i'm willing to do that but i've searched through the scriptures and i cannot find one good thing that god ever says about moab not one not even that you're a good adversary i can find nothing complimentary that god says ever ever for moab deuteronomy 34 6 speaking of moses and he buried him in a valley meaning god buried him and he buried him in a valley in the land of moab over against beth pior but no man knoweth of his sepulcher unto this day so moses the very one that god supernaturally moved for that was the leader of the true believers that came up and broke the word of god by smiting the rock twice god takes them up on the mountain he says look at the promised land it's a good land moses says yep it's there god says you're not going because you broke my word you magnified yourself instead of me moab moab spirit was so profound and so powerful that it got on the one that even led the true believer out to the point that he would magnify himself instead of god and he buried him in the valley in the land of moab over against beth pior now we're going to see why it was why moab was so important because moab in the country of moab right over against where the children of israel would exit moab and go into the promised land here is the city of beth pior and this moab moab in all its fallen condition still contained contained beth pior beth pure means the house of the opening moses was buried at the house of the opening this is why moab whether they knew what they were doing or whether they didn't this is why moab couldn't let israel come through because moab is directly right beside the promised land and if the children of israel get through moab they're through the open door they are literally through the house of the open door there's nothing stopping them now they've been caught up they've been raptured up beth pior was in moab and this is where moses was buried moses was buried there because he magnified himself he yielded to the lust of the flesh the pride of life and the lust of the ice he yielded to a spirit that was not like christ and he magnified that spirit over the word of god and god took him and he buried him right at the open door that was the outcome of moses who god spoke lip to ear with do you think he's going to cut us any slack do you think he's going to allow us to come back any other way every word of god complete death to self complete death to self look at everything that moses did i would venture to say that if you waste if you weighed his good against his bad they would probably beat us probably all of us combined but it would probably definitely be each of us as an individual his good to his bad but when he magnified himself over one word of god god took him and he buried him right by the open door he says you can't go through you can never go through an open door with one speck of glow to see in on you with that laodicean spirit it cannot get through the open door not one speck of it no jealousy no pride no fighting none of that god wouldn't permit it for moses he's certainly not going to permit it for us god buried him at the house of the open door now i told you that in review of the scripture i could not find one thing god had to say good about moab and that is true but there is the book of ruth in the book of ruth is a very beautiful picture there how that boaz the type of christ how that naomi went over into a strange country moab as a backsliding so she left her home country and she went into moab and brother brandon said she backslid think of naomi naomi went there with her son her two sons and her husband she went there she was hungry naturally hungry and they had bread in moab so she went there with her sons and her two husband and the natural cravings of her stomach cost her everything because when she came back she had nothing she had lost her husband and she had lost her two sons and one of her daughter-in-laws all for the lust of the flesh carnal eating carnal bread natural bread brother bryan says she left where she was supposed to be she went to moab she backslid and the scripture says when she comes back she has nothing i would venture to say it would have been better to die in the homeland i would venture to say that it would have been better just to die trusting in god because if you ever go into moab it'll take everything that you had if you ever get out of that open door you're going to lose everything that you've gained it the world will take it all don't ever ever leave the open door brother brandon says revelation to a true believer can never be overemphasized that's why i'm preaching this tonight that's what i'm preaching is the importance of revelation the importance of getting out of remember the laodicean is not just a church age it's not just a city it's a condition it's a spirit getting out of a low to see in condition through an open door and the only way you can do that is complete death to self if you don't go through that open door even though the loose ends may be sweet in your mouth you're going to lose them you will lose everything that god has revealed to you if you don't go through that open door the scripture says when a man is given something if he don't do something with it god will take that back away from him that's not verbatim but you know the scripture that i'm referring to he has to keep reaching out in the spirit he has to get through the open door naomi backslid she went out of the land and brought back out of the country of moab she was a moabite referring to ruth now and brought back out of the country of moab she was a moabite absolutely a picture of the gentile bride so here's a paradox you can have the entirety of the scripture and not one good thing said about moab nothing but out of that think of yourself now remember it's not out there not one ounce of this is out there this is here there is nothing good you can say about yourself you can search and you can search and you can search and you're not going to find it but out of that god somehow is still capable to pull a roof to pull the roof that brother brandon says is absolutely a perfect type of the gentile bride and naomi had told her she had kissed her and told her to go back to her people and she said i will go with your people let your people be my people and let your dwelling be my dwelling that your god be my god and nothing but death shall separate us where you die i die where you are buried i'll be buried now there is a picture of the gentile church coming into christ what is a picture of the gentile church coming into christ i will go with your people i will go with the word the word will be my people the dwelling of the word will be my dwelling the god of the word will be my god nothing but death shall separate me in this dimension from that word where that word is buried i will be buried brother branham says now there is a picture of the gentile church coming into christ death utter death to self ruth completely died to naomi because we were once aliens away from god only the jews was the ones to be saved but we being dead in christ take on abraham's seed and our heirs according to the promise i've already been an hour and i kept you way too long the last wednesday that i preached and i promise i won't do that so we're going to go through the rest of this real quick and we're going to wrap up but just stay with me can you give me 10 15 minutes there's a lot more here but i'm not going to do that this is speaking of esther esther 2 verse 18. it says then the king made a great feast into all of his princes and to his servants even esther's feast so this is after esther has been chosen and the king says i'm going i'm happy about this i'm going to make a feast even esther's face and he made a release to the provinces and gave gifts according to the state of the king so he marries esther he's happy he has a great feast and he gives gifts to everybody and then and when the virgins were gathered together the second time then mordecai is set in the king's gate so he's thrilled with esther he's super happy and then he wants another virgin so i'm not sure how that works but that's what the king did but there's been a first pull and esther's been chosen and there's been a second pull and all the women's been all the virgins all the churches have been invited you follow me and after this second pull is made there is a position that changes and mordecai is not wandering around in the courtyard anymore he's not wandering around outside the wall mordecai is in the king's gate i would venture to say that now mordecai is setting right before the open door after this second poll and esther had not yet been completely revealed it says esther had not yet showed her kindred nor her people as mordecai charged her for esther did the commandment of mordecai like is when she was brought up with him and in those days meaning between the after the first pull and after the second poll but after but before the third pole and mordecai is in the in the king's gate he's at the opening of the king in those days while mordecai set in the king's gate two of the king's chamberlain's bigtha and tarish of those which kept the door their keepers of the door were wrath and sought to lay hands on the king after the second poll but before the third pull when the messenger is right at the open door there's two that raise up and the wrath with the word the wrath with the king why i have no idea the scripture doesn't say brother branham doesn't say this is just me if you allow me this thought remember these are the king's chamberlain's the keeper of the door there's only two people behind that door the king and esther maybe these men had virgins that weren't chosen if the spirit holds true the spirit of mohab if the spirit of mohabs holds true that's exactly what it was now again that's just me i could be a million miles wrong but there's something that they were jealous of there was something that they were wroth with the king these are the king's chamberlains remember there's the king there's esther and then there's these two guys what have they got to be upset about there's only one thing they could be upset about and that's the relationship between the king and the queen that's all that's there there's no other people there it's the king and the queen and the keepers of the door get roth about something whatever that is and the thing was known to mordecai because remember mordecai's mordecai's not outside wandering around anymore mordecai is sitting right at the open door and the thing was known to mordecai and he told it to the bride he told it to esther the queen and esther the queen certified the king thereof in mordecai's name she said that man's message is correct to the king she's now vouching for mordecai to the king and the the queen all she has to say is that man's message is correct and when inquisition was made of the matter it was found out and therefore so when they went and they searched it out they found out yes that is true therefore they were both hanged on a tree the two the the two that was keeping the door they were both hanged on a tree and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king why is that scripture in there it doesn't even take the time to say what they were mad about but it lays a scripture in there between the second and the third pole when the when the when mordecai the one that put the queen in her position when he is right before the open door now there's two that keep that door that gets rough why is that scripture in there because there's always two keeping the door there was moab and there was edom that was keeping beth pure there's these two king these two chamberlains but it goes way back beyond that because how many was trying to keep abraham from the promised land his daddy and his nephew when he got them finally out of the way how many was trying to keep him two sarah his own wife and hagar remember that was before her name was changed but his father and lot tried to keep him from the promised land his own wife and hagar came up with a scheme to try to produce the promised son without the proper will of god you go down through the family of abraham and he sends eliezer to go get a bride for isaac and he finds rebecca and rebecca you read in the scripture and laban and i believe it was nahor but don't hold me to that no uh laban and bethel or something along that lines it's the father of rebecca and her uncle eliezer comes and says this is what i prayed and this is what god did like i prayed this that the damsel would do x y and z and she came and she did x y and z and i never said anything to her and the father and the uncle said well god's clearly with you how can we say anything take her and go duh but it says that the mother and the brother the mother and the brother of rebecca eliezer gave great gifts to he had already given them great gifts so when the mother and the brother get time to chime in they say oh no don't let her go right now don't let her go to the promised son right now wait at least 10 days the father and the uncle say god is clearly with you take her and go god speed but the one that he had given great gifts to said no don't go yet don't go through the open door yet don't eat of the open book yet stay in this condition that you're at right now just for a little bit just for a little bit longer you can serve god with all of your heart a little bit but for right now just for today just just wait for a second not a full commitment yet there's only one thing that would motivate that mother and that brother to not tell her tell her the same thing that the dad and the uncle did there is only one thing is that is they wanted more gifts they wanted more gifts there is no other motivation instead of getting her out the open door and getting her into the promised land it was more important to the mother and the brother to get more gifts and have more manifestations on themselves the dad and the uncle said god is clearly with you go but remember how many resisted two you look at moses how many resisted moses in egypt as the musicians come how many resisted moses in egypt two janice and jamers skip all the way over to the book of revelation because i'm out of time how many is resisting the bride is it 1 million horsemen 3 million horsemen 2 million horsemen why is it two million horsemen why wouldn't a million horsemen suffice i mean that is a lot or if you're gonna not just send a million why not send three million why two let's go all the way back to the beginning now and how many resisted the true believer in heaven how many was it that fell two-thirds two-thirds fell two-thirds resisted the truth why did two-thirds resist the truth why wasn't it five-eighths why was why was it two-thirds why was it two million why was it two in egypt why was it two constantly plaguing abraham why was it two that came against the two children of the true children of egypt when they were just trying to get through the open door why because it's always true with you your soul will always be resisted by your hybrid spirit and your hybrid flesh always it was the battle that began in heaven that spilled over and became human battles and it's the battle that rages on now as we stand together look at the spirits behind it look at the tactics behind it look at the spirit behind the battle look at the tactics behind the battle and don't make the mistake of putting that battle too far away that battle's in your chair that battle is in your mirror it's in my chair it's in my mirror it's not outside these doors it's not in the person beside of you this has been the pattern from the beginning the pattern will not fail there is nothing good to say about moab not one thing but out of that god will place the word in your soul and he'll bring a gentile broad out of that there is nothing good to say about moab there's nothing good to say about these two million horsemen there's nothing good to say about the two that resisted abraham and the two that resisted um moses there's nothing good to say about the two that kept the door to the king there in the days of esther nothing good they both hung on a tree and cursed it is he that hangeth on a tree there is nothing good that we can say about ourselves but out of that god will pick up a word in your soul and manifest it through your hybrid flesh and through your hybrid spirit and he will have a bride and perfection you don't have to take the sword to it paul says that he beat himself black and blue paul wasn't out with a stick every day hitting himself paul was fighting a spiritual warfare of death to self resisting all the spirits and all the tactics of the enemy and completely dying to himself he was beating himself black and blue blue in a spiritual sense he was constantly bringing himself under subjection of the word because even paul's flesh and even paul's spirit says you're not coming through here and we're not going to support you and if you try we're going to do everything we can to resist you to the point that we will fight you with the sword of the word we will try to confuse you in the word if we have to and even if that don't work we'll try another tactic and we'll get you to fall matthew 23 12 as we close whosoever shall exalt himself shall be a beast it's not optional whosoever shall exalt himself shall be a beast and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted if one is true the other is true but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in that is the battle cry every day of your hybridization i'm not going in and i'm going to try to keep you from going in let's recognize the spirit let's recognize the tactics let's die to two-thirds of ourself and let the one that has not fallen the only good thing about us that word and our soul have the preeminence because brother branham says revelation to a true believer can never be overemphasized let that word in your soul get through the open door and don't look back let it eat from an open book regardless of who would try to fight against that remember it says you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men where are we going saints we're going to the kingdom of heaven we are the walking kingdom of heaven but there's going to be those spirits spirits that is going to resist that and they're not wanting to go in themselves and they do not want to suffer you to go in spirits don't die the man does but spirits don't die that's why there's just as strong today as they were back then and that's what they want to do i think you've got my point let's pray precious lord jesus we just want to thank you once again for this time that you've given us father and we just pray that you would take the words that's been spoken and you would make them a reality in the hearts of your people lord make them a reality to me father let us truly recognize how close this battle is let us recognize by what we can see externally in the signs of the times pointing us to what phase of the battle that we're in lord and may we truly recognize that this is not a far off battle lord that this is the closing moments of the of the battle this is the closing times of the battle and the battle is right in us father and we must resist with everything that we have to be an overcomer and to leave this dimension father i pray as we would commit ourselves to you tonight that you would just be with us we pray for those that are gone brother emmanuel and our pastor father may you just be with them especially father supernaturally anoint them lord direct them keep them safe father bring them back at the appointed time lord we commit ourselves to to you in love thanking you father that you saw fit to bless each and every individual that's here tonight by way of sending us a true prophet lord you sent us a true gift of a true prophet to break your word to us lord to use that vessel and loose the seals of the book father you have given us the greatest gift father and you have allowed us to live in an age in a time to where we can walk in full truth that we can rapture up lord through an open door that we can eat and read of an open book lord may we not take that for granted father but may we go in lord full force lord may we go in with such force that we would pull somebody with us may we be a living walking bible fullness of the word of god we pray and we ask this in the name of the lord
