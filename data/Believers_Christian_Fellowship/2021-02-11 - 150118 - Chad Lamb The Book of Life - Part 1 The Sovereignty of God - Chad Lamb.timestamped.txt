[0:04] today i want to look at the subject
[0:06] of the book of life and i'll probably do
[0:08] this in a couple parts looking at the
[0:10] book of life
[0:11] but the first part i want to look at is
[0:12] the sovereignty of god
[0:14] and the sovereignty of god especially in
[0:16] relation to the book of life
[0:18] so if we could all turn to the book of
[0:20] romans together
[0:23] we'll go to romans chapter 11.
[0:35] all right romans chapter 11 and we're
[0:38] going to read from verse 33.
[0:55] i went too far i went to corinthians
[0:59] romans 11 and 33
[1:04] oh the depth of the riches both of the
[1:06] wisdom and the knowledge of god
[1:08] how unsearchable are his judgments and
[1:10] his ways past finding out
[1:12] for who hath known the mind of the lord
[1:14] or who hath been his counselor
[1:16] or who hath first given to him and it
[1:18] shall be recompensed unto him again
[1:20] for of him and through him and to him
[1:23] are all things to whom be glory forever
[1:28] which of us can advise god who can give
[1:32] god counsel
[1:33] who here can instruct him on a decision
[1:35] that needs to be made which of us have
[1:37] the mind that can do that
[1:38] who has given something to god and god's
[1:40] going to have to give it back to us
[1:41] because he owes us a debt
[1:43] see it's all of god and it's all in god
[1:46] and it's all for god
[1:48] amen that's the sovereignty of god amen
[1:52] let's just ask the lord's blessing of
[1:53] the reading of the word dear heavenly
[1:54] father we ask that you would
[1:56] bless this word lord god as we read it i
[1:59] pray that we could absorb it into our
[2:00] souls lord and we be changed
[2:02] that you would change us from what we
[2:04] are to what you desire for us to be lord
[2:06] you have an image of us in your mind
[2:09] lord when we come to full maturity lord
[2:11] we're pressing towards that
[2:12] we just pray that by the spirit you
[2:14] would take this word and shape and mold
[2:15] your church this morning
[2:17] we ask for your blessings in jesus
[2:18] christ's name amen
[2:20] you can be seated
[2:25] so we're going to look at the book of
[2:26] life but we want to understand
[2:28] that this book of life was written
[2:31] by the almighty god right
[2:35] it was written by him who needs no
[2:37] counsel
[2:38] who needs no advice who needs no
[2:40] structure
[2:41] who needs no help in anything the book
[2:43] of life was written by this being
[2:46] right and so he is the only one
[2:49] authorized to author a book like this
[2:51] the book of life
[2:52] but he and his sovereign will and by his
[2:54] own desire
[2:55] and by his own pleasure has created a
[2:57] book of life
[2:59] we've got to get that in our mind
[3:00] straight let's go to the book of
[3:01] revelations and just look at a couple
[3:03] places in revelations
[3:04] concerning this book now i intend to
[3:07] take my time this morning
[3:09] it won't won't be long but i want to
[3:11] read a lot of verses together so keep
[3:13] your bibles with you
[3:15] revelations chapter 20
[3:23] and we'll start reading in verse 11.
[3:28] and i saw a great white throne in him
[3:30] that sat on it from whose face the earth
[3:32] and the heaven fled away
[3:33] and there was found no place for them
[3:36] and i saw the dead small and great stand
[3:38] before god and the books were opened
[3:40] and another book was opened which is the
[3:42] book of life
[3:45] and the dead were judged out of those
[3:47] things which were written in the books
[3:48] according to their works and the sea
[3:50] gave up the dead which were in it and
[3:52] death and hell delivered up the dead
[3:54] which were in them
[3:55] and they were judged every man according
[3:57] to their works
[3:58] and death and hell were cast into the
[4:00] lake of fire this is the second death
[4:02] and whosoever was not found written in
[4:04] the book of life
[4:05] was cast into the lake of fire so here
[4:08] we have
[4:09] this book of life and this is the final
[4:11] judgment this is not the bride standing
[4:13] in this judgment but this is everyone
[4:15] else
[4:15] all that ever lived on the earth all the
[4:18] dead came up
[4:19] in what's called the white throne
[4:20] judgment and this book of life is open
[4:22] and now the book of life is open and if
[4:25] your
[4:25] name was in the book of life you go into
[4:28] eternal life
[4:29] and if your name was not found in the
[4:31] book of life you went into eternal
[4:33] damnation
[4:34] everybody clear on that that's what the
[4:36] scripture says so this book of life
[4:39] is pretty important i would say it's
[4:42] very important
[4:43] right because at the final judgment
[4:45] that's what the world is going to be
[4:46] judged by
[4:47] whose name is in or not found in this
[4:50] record of the book of life
[4:52] okay let's go back a few chapters to 17
[4:56] revelations chapter 17.
[5:01] now the question would be if this
[5:05] name on the book of life is essential
[5:08] and not having that name in the book of
[5:09] life
[5:11] is cast into the lake of fire how do i
[5:13] get my name on this book of life
[5:15] wouldn't that be important right if if
[5:19] not being there is eternal damnation if
[5:21] not being there is lake of fire then i
[5:24] want to be on that book so how do i get
[5:26] my name on that book
[5:27] so let's look at revelation 17 and verse
[5:30] 8.
[5:32] and the beast that thou sawest was and
[5:34] is not and shall ascend out of the
[5:35] bottomless pit and go into perdition
[5:37] and they that dwell on the earth shall
[5:39] wonder whose names are not written in
[5:41] the book of life
[5:42] so those who have not their name written
[5:44] in this book of life
[5:45] are going to wander after this beast or
[5:47] admire this beast all right
[5:48] and they're going to be deceived by this
[5:50] beast
[5:52] if their names are not written in the
[5:53] book of life from
[5:56] the foundation of the world
[6:01] the book of life is from the foundation
[6:03] of the world
[6:04] when were your names on the book of life
[6:06] from the foundation
[6:08] of the world that's the key
[6:11] that's the sovereignty of god that's why
[6:14] we want to look at the book of life we
[6:15] want to first establish the sovereignty
[6:17] of god
[6:17] because the names were put on that book
[6:20] from before the foundation of the world
[6:22] he was the lamb slain the book has been
[6:25] sealed
[6:25] the book was there from before the
[6:27] foundation of the world
[6:29] and the names were on the book from
[6:31] before the foundation of the world amen
[6:35] so how do you get your name on the book
[6:37] it had to be there before the foundation
[6:40] of the world
[6:43] he's not adding names to the book
[6:46] the book we find in revelations was a
[6:49] sealed book
[6:50] and it was sealed with seven seals and
[6:51] the seals had to be removed
[6:53] at the end time but it was the names
[6:55] were already on the book
[6:58] he's not adding names
[7:02] let's turn to romans chapter nine so we
[7:06] looked at the book but i want to
[7:07] establish god's authority and god's
[7:09] sovereignty still
[7:10] romans chapter nine
[7:16] see when we get into this subject
[7:20] you have to be very very careful that
[7:23] you don't
[7:23] allow your own human personality and
[7:26] your own human affection
[7:28] determine how god thinks because god
[7:31] doesn't think like we think
[7:34] you know we look at this subject and we
[7:36] start to play games like well fair
[7:38] and not fair and how can and
[7:41] you see god when god looks down
[7:45] god before there was ever an atom a
[7:47] molecule a gnat before there was ever
[7:49] dust before there was ever anything
[7:51] god had come up with a plan in his mind
[7:53] how he was going to be known by his
[7:55] children
[7:56] and god has laid out the plan and god is
[7:58] working the plan
[7:59] and god did it all and it consists
[8:03] of him and by him and for
[8:06] him and without him nothing exists
[8:12] so he is the one who knows all things
[8:15] he is the one who created all things for
[8:17] a purpose there
[8:18] you can you can say well what about my
[8:20] neighbor your neighbor wouldn't even
[8:22] existed if god had not
[8:24] thought of it from the foundation of the
[8:25] world and placed
[8:27] adams into the world building material
[8:29] and life and water and all the things
[8:31] that come to extend his life
[8:32] he's the one who has the right to decide
[8:33] because he's the one who created it all
[8:37] right so
[8:40] we we got to be very careful when we get
[8:42] into the sovereignty of god and we get
[8:44] into the book of life
[8:45] that we don't start to use our human
[8:47] thinking and our human emotion
[8:48] we must find our truth solidly placed in
[8:51] the scriptures
[8:54] because our own human emotion because we
[8:56] live we have to understand we live in a
[8:58] fallen body our emotions are not correct
[9:02] have your emotions 100 percent prove the
[9:04] truth to you
[9:05] or have they led you astray from time to
[9:08] time or maybe daily
[9:09] or so we can't use human emotion or
[9:13] human thinking determine how
[9:15] god will or how he won't or what god's
[9:17] going to do or why he'll do it or
[9:19] whether he's just or not in doing it
[9:21] you can't use your brain and your
[9:23] thinking to determine those things
[9:25] god is the only one with the right to
[9:27] determine what is just and unjust
[9:31] we have no right being down here looking
[9:33] up and saying that is just and that is
[9:36] not just
[9:36] that is fair and that's unfair
[9:39] right it's like when you have your
[9:41] children and you're going to do
[9:43] something you say
[9:43] okay you right here and you go there and
[9:46] we'll do this and we'll switch up like
[9:47] that's not fair and you look at your
[9:50] kids and say
[9:51] that's for me to decide
[9:55] they don't know all the facts they don't
[9:56] know all the details they don't know why
[9:58] you made that decision they don't know
[9:59] what's happening next they don't know
[10:00] what's in the plan
[10:02] in your mind in your mind the plan is
[10:04] perfectly fair
[10:05] after this one gets this privilege this
[10:07] time the next time it'll be the next one
[10:09] and i know there's a return trip and
[10:11] we'll do this i know in my mind
[10:12] what i'm going to do for my children and
[10:14] i know it's just and i know it's fair
[10:16] but the first time that i don't give my
[10:18] whole mind immediately i just give a
[10:19] part of my mind
[10:20] there some of my children will look at
[10:22] me and say that's not fair
[10:26] they do the same thing to god they look
[10:28] at just a portion of the mind of god a
[10:30] portion of the scripture
[10:31] a portion of what brother branham's
[10:32] saying and they're saying that's not
[10:34] fair
[10:34] but this prophet of god was unique in
[10:37] the fact that he was diving into the
[10:38] back parts of god's mind
[10:41] and he was back there taking the
[10:42] overview of redemption
[10:44] of the plan all through the bible and he
[10:46] was seeing from
[10:47] eagle vision flying high above the whole
[10:50] timeline of humanity
[10:52] and he was seeing it's perfectly fair
[10:55] it's absolutely just god has the right
[11:01] so we listen to what the prophet says
[11:03] and we start determining what's fair not
[11:05] fair and what's just and not just
[11:07] we have to be very very careful in how
[11:10] we make our determinations
[11:12] so in romans chapter 9 let's look at
[11:14] verse 6.
[11:18] romans 9 and 6 not as though the word of
[11:21] god hath taken on effect
[11:23] for they are not all israel which of our
[11:25] it which are
[11:26] of israel neither because they are seed
[11:29] of abraham are they all children
[11:31] but in isaac shall thy seed be called
[11:33] now this is
[11:34] this is a blockbuster statement that
[11:37] paul is making
[11:39] because you know when the pharisees face
[11:42] jesus say
[11:43] we're we're children of abraham because
[11:45] being children of abraham made them seed
[11:47] made them elect made them chosen of god
[11:49] made them the royal nation made them
[11:52] heir to all the promises
[11:53] but here he's saying not all of israel's
[11:56] israel
[11:56] jesus even said that he said if you were
[11:58] abraham's children you would do what
[12:00] abraham does
[12:01] you're not abraham's children you're of
[12:03] the natural lineage of abraham but
[12:04] you're not of the royal lineage you're
[12:06] not of the spiritual lineage of abraham
[12:08] because if you were the spiritual
[12:10] lineage of abraham you would receive me
[12:13] so he's saying not all of israel is
[12:15] israel
[12:17] but only the promised seed
[12:21] is of israel see
[12:24] they could look at that and say that's
[12:25] not fair
[12:28] but only god can decide
[12:32] verse 7 neither because they are seed of
[12:34] abraham are they children but in
[12:36] isaac shall thy seed be called that is
[12:38] they which
[12:39] are of the children of the flesh they
[12:40] are not the children of god
[12:42] but the children of the promise are
[12:43] counted for the seed
[12:45] what promise that promise that god spoke
[12:48] with his word
[12:49] that seed line that was going to come
[12:51] forth down through all generations
[12:53] that's the seed of promise brothers and
[12:55] sisters you and i are part of that
[12:57] promise
[12:59] amen amen verse 9
[13:03] for this is the word of promise at this
[13:05] time will i come and sarah shall have a
[13:07] son
[13:07] and not only this but when rebecca also
[13:09] had conceived by one even by our father
[13:12] isaac
[13:12] okay stop right there abraham is going
[13:15] to have a promised seed a promised son
[13:17] and in the natural that promise was
[13:19] for a child to come from sarah and that
[13:21] child that came from sarah was isaac
[13:22] making him the fulfillment of the
[13:24] promise in the natural
[13:26] all right so after that so now we're
[13:29] seeing the godly lineage come forth
[13:30] right the promised seed the promise and
[13:32] the natural
[13:33] it's coming through isaac and that
[13:35] birthright is coming down through isaac
[13:36] correct
[13:37] but look what happens in the next
[13:39] generation
[13:42] verse 11 for the children being not yet
[13:44] born
[13:45] neither having done good or evil
[13:48] that the purpose of god according to
[13:50] election might stand
[13:52] not of works but of him that calleth it
[13:54] was said unto her
[13:56] the elder shall serve the younger
[13:59] as it is written jacob have i loved
[14:02] but esau have i
[14:05] hated that's not
[14:08] fair neither one
[14:12] being born yet neither one yet having a
[14:16] chance to do good
[14:18] or to do evil before they ever came
[14:21] forth won the womb
[14:22] god was declaring i love jacob
[14:25] and i hate esau
[14:30] you cannot use your human mind your
[14:32] human sympathy and your human emotion to
[14:34] understand god
[14:36] that's why the humanistic world that we
[14:38] live in that's leaning to the
[14:39] understanding intellect of man
[14:41] is a million miles away from god and
[14:43] cannot be trusted that's why brother
[14:45] branham said education is of the devil
[14:47] because education is centered
[14:49] on humanistic ideas and philosophies and
[14:51] thinking
[14:53] our world revolves around the man's mind
[14:56] and our world is not to revolve around
[14:58] man's mind the
[15:00] the entire creation is to revolve around
[15:02] god
[15:03] and his word that's why brother branham
[15:06] could say
[15:07] civilization is of the devil education
[15:09] is of the devil
[15:10] it's not wrong to learn to read and
[15:11] write it's not long to learn about the
[15:13] creation of god those things aren't
[15:14] wrong
[15:15] and we still must have that to abide in
[15:17] this world he wasn't against sending the
[15:18] kids to school
[15:19] but he was saying the foundation is
[15:21] wrong
[15:23] and it will lead you astray
[15:28] let's keep reading what shall we say
[15:32] then
[15:32] is there unrighteousness with god
[15:37] see what he's saying no not all israel's
[15:40] israel but only a certain portion of
[15:42] abraham
[15:43] that promised seed is the real one just
[15:46] like
[15:47] when when there was a seed come to
[15:49] rebecca and there was an isaac and a
[15:50] jacob
[15:51] or a a jacob and um
[15:55] esau thank you there's a jacob and an
[15:58] esau
[15:58] and he's saying before they came forth
[16:00] from the womb
[16:02] this is not fair when you're using a
[16:03] humanistic mind
[16:05] you can't call this fair from a human
[16:08] perspective but if you will ever climb
[16:09] up a little higher with eagle vision
[16:11] and set your wings through the
[16:13] scriptures through the old testament in
[16:14] the new testament
[16:15] and set those wings and look down from
[16:17] god's perspective
[16:19] it's perfectly fair and perfectly just
[16:25] amen
[16:29] what shall we say then is there
[16:31] unrighteousness with god
[16:33] god forbid how could he who is righteous
[16:36] who is the source of righteousness how
[16:39] could he be unrighteous and how could he
[16:40] do anything that's not righteous
[16:43] see if god's saying esau i hated jacob
[16:46] i've loved before they were ever born
[16:48] then that is a righteous statement
[16:51] and that is a just statement
[16:54] because it comes from the source of
[16:56] righteousness and it comes from the
[16:57] source of justice
[16:58] are we on the same page amen
[17:04] 15 for he saith to moses i will have
[17:06] mercy on whom i will have mercy
[17:09] and i will have compassion on whom i
[17:11] will have compassion
[17:14] so then it is not of him that willeth
[17:16] nor of him that runeth but of god
[17:18] that showeth mercy brothers and sisters
[17:21] it's not our efforts
[17:24] it's not how hard we try it's not all
[17:26] the hoops that we jump through
[17:27] it's not all the labors that we do it's
[17:29] not all the books of the bible that we
[17:30] read in a month it's not all the times
[17:31] we attend church that's not what gets us
[17:34] the grace
[17:35] he said i will have compassion on whom i
[17:38] will have compassion and i will have
[17:40] mercy on whom i
[17:42] will have mercy it's not
[17:46] based on the condition that you find
[17:48] yourself in
[17:49] all right god's compassion and god's
[17:51] mercy is not based on the condition that
[17:53] you find yourself in
[17:55] if that was the case every time you
[17:57] failed god you would be outside of mercy
[18:00] and compassion right if it was based on
[18:03] works it was based on deeds
[18:05] every time that you messed up big and i
[18:07] won't show a raise of hands
[18:08] or show a showing of hands how many
[18:12] times you've messed up big in the last
[18:13] month
[18:14] but you know i'd be holding up both
[18:16] hands
[18:19] then every time if it was dependent on
[18:21] my condition it was dependent on my
[18:23] works it was dependent on my deeds
[18:26] how well i fulfill the scripture i would
[18:28] constantly be outside of god's
[18:29] compassion
[18:30] and outside of god's mercy and i'd
[18:32] always be working to get back in
[18:34] but because before the foundation of the
[18:36] world before i was born
[18:38] before i come forth from the womb he
[18:40] could declare whether he loved me or
[18:41] hated me
[18:44] because he he will have compassion
[18:48] on whom he will have compassion and he
[18:50] will have mercy
[18:51] on whom he will have mercy and if he has
[18:54] decided to have compassion
[18:55] and mercy on you then there's nothing
[18:57] that you can do to remove yourself
[19:00] from god's compassion and his mercy
[19:04] hallelujah
[19:07] so if you look at the human perspective
[19:09] and say that's unfair i like that kind
[19:11] of unfair
[19:12] that it doesn't matter what i do and if
[19:14] my neighbor who is not inside god's
[19:17] compassion and god's side and god's
[19:19] mercy
[19:19] can live a holier cleaner more just life
[19:22] than me
[19:22] but yet i can stay in god's compassion
[19:25] and mercy
[19:25] and this person has no access to god's
[19:28] compassion and mercy
[19:29] because their name was not on that book
[19:31] from before the foundation of the world
[19:33] they stand like esau who in his natural
[19:35] life happened to be the more righteous
[19:37] man
[19:39] especially before jacob's conversion
[19:41] before he wrestled with the angel
[19:44] esau was the better man in almost every
[19:46] area but esau was
[19:48] hated rejected
[19:51] and there was no compassion and no mercy
[19:54] for esau
[19:56] whereas jacob who was the promised seed
[19:58] who was the elect of god
[20:00] was a rascal we probably wouldn't have
[20:03] liked him
[20:06] but he was in position for god's
[20:08] compassion
[20:09] and for god's mercy amen
[20:14] i'm glad that we don't have to judge
[20:17] whether or not we're eligible for
[20:18] compassion or mercy or not
[20:20] i'm glad he's already chosen
[20:24] verse 16 so then it is not of him that
[20:27] willeth nor of him that runeth
[20:29] but of god that showeth mercy now it's
[20:31] not of him that willeth
[20:33] it's it doesn't matter how bad you want
[20:36] it to be a certain way
[20:40] it's not him that it's not your will
[20:42] it's not your desire
[20:44] it's not how real bad you really really
[20:46] really really want it to be differently
[20:48] it'll never be differently it'll always
[20:50] be according to god's will
[20:55] but of god that showeth mercy verse 17
[20:58] for the scripture saith unto pharaoh
[21:00] even for this same purpose have i raised
[21:02] thee up that i might show my power to
[21:04] the
[21:05] my power in thee and that my name might
[21:07] be declared throughout all the earth
[21:12] it was god's purpose to raise up pharaoh
[21:17] but pharaoh had no part in god
[21:21] god decided to raise up pharaoh and
[21:23] pharaoh was going to heed
[21:25] to moses request multiple times was he
[21:28] not go back and read it
[21:29] he was going his heart and his heart he
[21:31] was going to consent to moses
[21:33] but god came down and hardened pharaoh's
[21:36] heart
[21:37] so that he would not concede to moses's
[21:41] request
[21:41] so that god could justly bring the
[21:44] plagues upon egypt
[21:45] and you look back and say how's that
[21:47] fair
[21:50] ask god don't ask me
[21:54] it's not my plan it's not my bible it's
[21:56] not my interpretation
[21:58] of it ask god
[22:02] verse 18 therefore hath mercy on whom he
[22:06] will have mercy
[22:07] and whom he will he hardeneth
[22:13] he's either god or he's not he's nothing
[22:16] in between
[22:17] he's either 100 god or
[22:20] he is not god and i don't want to serve
[22:23] somebody who's not 100
[22:25] god i don't want to serve a god that's
[22:27] not 100 in control
[22:28] i don't want to serve a god that's left
[22:30] things the chance left things the random
[22:32] i'm not serving that kind of god
[22:34] i'm serving a god who has called me and
[22:36] because he's called me my calling is
[22:38] is secure will never fail away
[22:42] my eternal destination is promised and
[22:44] cannot be stripped from me and nothing
[22:45] that can happen on this earth can ever
[22:46] remove me from that
[22:48] that's the kind of god that i want to
[22:49] serve hallelujah
[22:56] verse 19 thou wilt say then unto me
[22:59] why doth he yet find fault do you see
[23:01] the question
[23:03] this is the human carnal perspective
[23:05] talking to paul and paul's addressing
[23:07] the human carnal perspective
[23:09] that's why we have to let this mind that
[23:11] was in christ be in us
[23:13] we have to allow the spirit to wash us
[23:16] of our own thinking
[23:17] and allow the spirit to interpret the
[23:19] word into our hearts
[23:20] if not we come with a carnal
[23:21] interpretation of the word we start
[23:23] asking questions like paul's addressing
[23:25] then you say well is there
[23:26] unrighteousness god god forbid there's
[23:27] no one righteousness in god
[23:28] well then how can god find fault if he
[23:30] hardens and then he blames them for
[23:32] being hardened
[23:33] how can god find fault it sounds like a
[23:36] logical question
[23:37] in fact it's a very logical question
[23:40] that's the problem we're not supposed to
[23:41] use logic
[23:44] that's humanism that's humanistic
[23:46] thinking
[23:47] that's what we're being taught in
[23:48] schools
[23:50] reasoning deduction analysis you cannot
[23:54] find god that way
[23:55] and you cannot judge god or his word
[23:57] based off those criteria
[24:00] amen it's accepted by faith even if it
[24:02] doesn't make an ounce of sense to your
[24:04] carnal mind
[24:04] it's accepted by faith
[24:08] that will say unto me why why does he
[24:11] yet find fault
[24:12] for who hath resisted his will if it's
[24:14] all his will and he's doing it all
[24:16] how can he find fault how can he blame
[24:18] you
[24:19] nay i love this verse 20 nay
[24:23] but oh man who art thou who are you
[24:26] that replies against god who are you
[24:29] even to ask such a question
[24:34] god did it god said it you're
[24:37] questioning
[24:38] god
[24:41] neighborhood o man who or thou that
[24:43] replies against god shall the thing form
[24:45] say to him that formed it
[24:47] why hast thou made me thus
[24:50] can you imagine you got two you got two
[24:53] lumps of clay we'll get in this a minute
[24:54] and you make one into a bowl and you
[24:57] make one
[24:58] into a pitcher right
[25:02] and the picture says why did you make me
[25:04] a bull and the bull says why didn't you
[25:06] make me a picture
[25:06] and you say shut up i did what i wanted
[25:10] to do
[25:11] what right do you have to tell me your
[25:13] creator how to make you
[25:15] or what to do with you see how foolish
[25:18] that question is see how silly
[25:20] and preposterous that is
[25:23] it's like it's like a man standing over
[25:25] the anthill
[25:27] and the ants and the ant hill having a
[25:28] discussion on what the man's thinking
[25:30] and what he's going to do and why he
[25:31] does what he does they have no idea
[25:33] the same thing like us looking up to god
[25:35] and saying well this is the why he won't
[25:36] do that and he wouldn't do that because
[25:38] of this
[25:38] we have no idea just take the scripture
[25:42] just whatever the bible says that's the
[25:43] mind of god
[25:46] that's the fallacy with the world today
[25:48] we've taken in and we've got 33 000
[25:50] denominations because we can't just
[25:51] accept what he said we've got to try to
[25:53] twist it
[25:53] and move it into something that's more
[25:55] reasonable more logical or satisfies our
[25:57] humanistic idea of emotion and affection
[25:59] and love
[26:04] verse 21 hath not the potter power over
[26:07] the clay
[26:08] of the same lump to make one vessel into
[26:10] honor and another unto dishonor
[26:14] what if god willing to show his wrath
[26:18] and to make his power known endured with
[26:19] much longsuffering
[26:21] the vessels of wrath fitted to
[26:22] destruction listen
[26:24] vessels of wrath fitted to destruction
[26:27] he's using an analogy here of a potter
[26:29] making vessels and he takes one lump of
[26:31] clay
[26:32] and one vessel he makes under honor and
[26:33] one vessel he makes under dishonor
[26:36] he said that dishonorable vessel is
[26:39] fitted to destruction
[26:40] that means that vessel was created for
[26:44] destruction
[26:48] verse 23 and that he might make known
[26:51] the riches of his glory on the vessels
[26:53] of mercy
[26:53] which he had for prepared unto glory
[26:56] even us whom he hath called not of the
[26:59] jews only but also
[27:00] of the gentiles god has a purpose
[27:04] there's a purpose for the vessel fitted
[27:06] to destruction
[27:07] there's a purpose for the vessel of
[27:09] dishonor and there's a purpose for the
[27:10] vessel of honor
[27:11] and the purpose is so that he can have
[27:14] much long suffering on the vessel of
[27:15] dishonor fitted to destruction
[27:17] so that he might declare himself to the
[27:20] vessel of honor
[27:22] it's the law of contrast again
[27:25] amen i don't know about you but that
[27:29] excites me but it depends on which side
[27:31] of this equation you find yourself on
[27:34] if you're nervous about being esau this
[27:36] would scare me to death but if i believe
[27:38] in my heart that i fall into the
[27:39] promised seed line like isaac and jacob
[27:41] this thrills me beyond measure
[27:44] amen so you know
[27:49] to not love this doctrine puzzles me
[27:53] because this this doctrine tells me that
[27:55] i'm absolutely secure
[27:57] that i'm absolutely part of the the plan
[28:00] of god and can never be removed from
[28:01] that part
[28:02] this doctrine thrills me but if it would
[28:05] trouble me
[28:06] then maybe i'm not so sure about my
[28:08] eternal destination where i came from
[28:10] and where i'm going
[28:10] maybe i have some fear and
[28:12] inconsistencies in my heart and maybe
[28:14] that's why this doctrine troubles me
[28:17] amen
[28:24] let's turn to proverbs 16
[28:28] 14.
[28:36] proverbs 16 and verse 14.
[28:45] no not verse 14 verse 4 sorry proverbs
[28:48] 16 and verse 4
[28:52] the lord hath made all things for
[28:54] himself stop don't worry anymore
[28:56] is that true do we believe that the lord
[28:58] has made all things for himself
[29:02] yea even the wicked for the day
[29:06] of evil
[29:09] is that the scriptures that's the
[29:12] scriptures
[29:16] not everyone has the same chance you and
[29:19] i have
[29:21] that's the scriptures there are vessels
[29:25] fitted to destruction brute beast made
[29:28] to be taken and destroyed
[29:30] is that the scriptures there are he has
[29:33] made all things for himself yea
[29:34] even the wicked for the day of evil has
[29:37] he done it
[29:38] he said he did it he did it
[29:42] amen
[29:46] acts 15 18 said known unto god are
[29:49] all his works from the beginning of the
[29:51] world
[29:53] known unto god are all his works from
[29:55] the beginning of the world
[30:00] i want to read a section out of job
[30:01] together let's turn to job
[30:04] job is just before psalms and let's turn
[30:07] to jobs 38.
[30:11] or job 38 sorry job 38.
[30:16] i'm going to read from verse 1. this is
[30:17] a very long passage i'm not going to
[30:20] probably read all of it but i'm going to
[30:21] read a large portion so you can get the
[30:22] idea
[30:23] now here in the book of job we have job
[30:25] falling into his trials we have his
[30:26] friends coming to them
[30:28] and they're saying things about god and
[30:30] he's answering things about god
[30:32] they're having this discord or this
[30:34] discussion about the nature of god
[30:36] right you've probably sinned and god
[30:37] won't allow you to sin for secret sin
[30:39] god's going to punish you and job said
[30:41] no i've had a sacrifice i've not gotten
[30:42] a secret sin
[30:43] and all these things right and then on
[30:45] top of that job has a question about
[30:47] what shall happen unto man you know i
[30:49] can see the flower comes up again
[30:51] but man goes into the dust his children
[30:53] come and mourn his loss but where does
[30:54] he go is there any resurrection is
[30:56] basically the question
[30:57] and so there's all this debate and
[30:59] discussion going on about god
[31:02] and finally at the end of the book god
[31:04] comes down and answers
[31:06] and i love it when god speaks
[31:09] so all these experts on god come to job
[31:12] and begin to tell him about god
[31:14] and it's not that what they're saying is
[31:15] untrue they're not saying untrue things
[31:18] and job's answer it's not like job's
[31:19] answer is untrue but when god comes on
[31:21] the scene
[31:22] it changes everything let's just take a
[31:25] look at this
[31:26] in job 38 then the lord
[31:30] answered job out of the whirlwind and
[31:32] said
[31:33] who is this that darkeneth counsel by
[31:35] words without
[31:36] knowledge
[31:40] who is this that's telling you what to
[31:43] do
[31:43] who is this that's giving answers and
[31:45] they don't know what they're talking
[31:47] about
[31:53] who is this that darkeneth counsel by
[31:55] words without knowledge gird up now thou
[31:57] loins like a man for i will demand of
[31:58] thee and answer thou me
[32:01] god's not he's not this isn't the still
[32:03] small voice
[32:06] this isn't sweet jesus whispering
[32:08] tenderly in your ear
[32:11] this is god correcting his son
[32:14] screwed up now thy loins like a man for
[32:17] i will demand of thee and answer thou me
[32:19] so he's going to ask him a huge list of
[32:21] questions and he wants job to give him
[32:23] an answer
[32:24] to these questions where was thou when i
[32:28] laid the foundation of the earth
[32:30] declareth thou hast understanding who
[32:32] hath laid the measures thereof of thou
[32:34] knowest
[32:35] or who hath stretched the line upon it
[32:36] he's saying oh you're so smart guys
[32:39] answer these questions
[32:43] because if you can answer these
[32:44] questions then you have a right to
[32:46] decide what's going on in job's trial
[32:47] but if you can't answer these questions
[32:49] you have no right to pass any judgment
[32:51] you don't know hallelujah
[32:56] whereupon are the foundations there are
[32:58] fastened or who laid the cornerstone
[33:00] thereof
[33:01] when the morning stars sang together and
[33:03] all the sons of god shouted for joy
[33:04] or who showed up to see with the doors
[33:06] when it break forth as if it
[33:08] issued out of the womb when i made the
[33:10] cloud the garment thereof and thick
[33:12] darkness a swaddling cloth
[33:14] a swallowing band for it and break up
[33:16] for it my decreed places and set bars
[33:18] upon the doors
[33:19] bars and doors and said hitherto shalt
[33:21] thou come but no further
[33:23] and there shall thou proud waves be
[33:24] stayed hast thou commanded the morning
[33:27] since thy days
[33:29] have you commanded the morning since
[33:30] your days
[33:32] and caused the dayspring to know his
[33:34] place
[33:35] that it might take hold of the ends of
[33:37] the earth that the wicked might be
[33:38] shaken out of it
[33:39] it has turned his clay to the seal and
[33:41] they stand as a garment
[33:43] and from the wicked their light is
[33:44] withholding and the high arms shall be
[33:46] broken
[33:46] has thou entered into the springs of the
[33:48] sea or hast thou walked into search of
[33:51] the depth
[33:52] have the gates of death been opened unto
[33:54] thee or hast thou seen the doors of the
[33:56] shadow of death
[33:58] can any of us answer yes to any of these
[34:00] questions
[34:03] has thou perceived the breath of the
[34:04] earth declared if thou knowest at all
[34:09] declarest it if you're a know-it-all if
[34:12] thou knowest at all
[34:13] tell me these things see god
[34:16] god is not going to answer to man
[34:20] and god is not subject to our opinion of
[34:22] what he's doing
[34:26] god is god and when there's a lot of
[34:28] people in the earth and the days of job
[34:30] had a lot of opinions he showed up and
[34:31] this is how he talked
[34:33] and don't think that we're going to have
[34:34] a bunch of opinions about god
[34:36] about what his word means and about this
[34:38] and about the prophet of the day and
[34:39] about all this and we all got opinions
[34:41] don't think that god's going to be any
[34:42] different than the way he answered job
[34:50] verse 19 where is the way where light
[34:52] dwelleth
[34:53] where does light dwell and as for
[34:56] darkness where is the place thereof
[34:58] that thou should just take it to the
[34:59] bound thereof and that thou should just
[35:01] know the past
[35:02] to the house thereof know us that way
[35:04] because thou was then born
[35:06] do you know because were you born there
[35:08] then
[35:10] or because the number of thy days is
[35:12] great
[35:13] were you around before the foundation of
[35:15] the world
[35:17] were you born back then were your days
[35:19] were they numbered great do you know
[35:20] what happened back then
[35:22] this is what he's telling job
[35:26] hast thou entered into the treasures of
[35:27] the snow or hast thou seen the treasures
[35:29] of the hail
[35:30] which i have reserved against the time
[35:32] of trouble against the day of battle and
[35:33] war
[35:34] by what way is the light parted which
[35:36] scattereth the east wind upon the earth
[35:38] who hath divided a watercourse for the
[35:40] overflowing of waters or a way for the
[35:42] lightning of the thunder to cause it to
[35:44] rain on the earth where no man is or the
[35:46] wilderness where there is no man
[35:48] to satisfy the desolate and waste ground
[35:50] and to cause the blood of the tender
[35:51] herb to bring
[35:52] to spring forth hath to reign a father
[35:54] or who hath forgotten the drops of dew
[35:57] out of whose womb come the ice and the
[35:59] hory frost of heaven
[36:00] who hath gendered it do you know
[36:06] the waters are hid is with a stone and
[36:07] the face of the deep is frozen
[36:09] can't thou bind the sweet influence of
[36:11] pleiades now he's going up to the stars
[36:13] he's talking about constellations
[36:15] can thou bind the sweet influence of
[36:17] pilates or loose the bands of orion
[36:19] can style bring forth mazeroth in his
[36:21] season or cast out guide arcturus with
[36:23] his sons
[36:24] noah's thou the ordinance of heaven cast
[36:26] thou set the dominion thereof in the
[36:28] earth
[36:28] cast thou lift up thy voice to the
[36:30] clouds that abundance of waters may
[36:32] cover thee
[36:32] can't thou send lightnings that they may
[36:34] go and say unto thee here we are
[36:37] who hath put wisdom in the inward parts
[36:38] or who hath given understanding to the
[36:40] heart
[36:41] who can number the clouds in wisdom or
[36:42] who can stay the bottles of heaven
[36:44] when the dust grow within the hardness
[36:46] and the clods cleave fast together
[36:47] will thou hunt the prey for the lion or
[36:50] fill the appetite of the young lions
[36:52] when they couch in their dens and abide
[36:53] in the cobra and the covert to lie in
[36:55] wait
[36:56] who provideth food for the raven who
[36:58] provideth for the raven his food
[37:00] when his young ones cry unto god they
[37:02] wander for lack of meat
[37:05] he's even talking about the care of the
[37:07] animals
[37:09] this is a god who knows all things
[37:13] this is a major paradigm shift for job
[37:16] and all his friends they went from an
[37:19] earthly discussion all the ants on the
[37:20] ant hills looking up towards god
[37:22] and god sucked them right up to his
[37:23] perspective and say what about this
[37:25] what about that tell me about this
[37:27] answer this question were you there
[37:28] are you of ancient of days did you see
[37:30] the foundation of the world who laid the
[37:31] cornerstone
[37:32] who gendered the horry frost
[37:36] what a paradigm shift and he goes on
[37:39] through all of
[37:40] chapter 39 we won't read all of it but
[37:42] it'd be good to go home and read it
[37:43] sometime
[37:44] chapter 40 moreover the lord answered
[37:48] job and said
[37:49] shall he that contendeth with the
[37:51] almighty and struck him
[37:53] are you given instruction to god
[37:58] he that reproveth god let him answer it
[38:01] so two chapters 38 39 he asked him a
[38:04] a myriad of questions about creation and
[38:06] about the existence and about the stars
[38:08] and about
[38:09] everything and then he says are you that
[38:11] contendeth with god
[38:13] and he that reproveth god let him answer
[38:19] because if you can answer all those
[38:20] questions then you have a right to
[38:21] reprove god
[38:22] or to contend with god but if you cannot
[38:24] answer those questions you have no right
[38:26] to give counsel to contend with to
[38:28] question or to reprove god
[38:32] here's job's answer verse 3 or chapter
[38:35] 40 verse 3 then job answered the lord
[38:37] and said
[38:37] behold i am vile
[38:41] what would you feel like if you had just
[38:43] had that discussion it wasn't really a
[38:45] discussion
[38:46] it was a lecture what would you feel
[38:49] like
[38:50] job said i am vile what shall i answer
[38:54] thee
[38:55] i will lay my hand upon my mouth
[39:00] once have i spoken but i will not answer
[39:03] yea twice
[39:03] but i will proceed no further
[39:08] i tried it but i could see that i was a
[39:10] miserable wretch i should not have ever
[39:11] spoken
[39:13] and then god takes off again on another
[39:16] lecture
[39:17] all through all through the rest of 40
[39:20] all through 41. he starts talking about
[39:22] behemoth
[39:23] and leviathan of the deep he starts
[39:25] talking about things we have no
[39:26] idea what he's talking about he says you
[39:30] know about those because i do
[39:31] you know you know where leviathan hide
[39:33] you know can you bring him out of the
[39:34] deep
[39:35] you know about behemoth when he sucks up
[39:36] the waters of the of the jordan with his
[39:38] great mouth
[39:39] you know all about that amen
[39:44] let me get over to verse 42 at the end
[39:46] of another
[39:47] lecture lecture number two then job
[39:50] answered the lord and said
[39:52] i know that thou canst do everything
[39:55] and that no thought can be withholden
[39:57] from thee
[39:59] he got a glimpse at the majesty of
[40:01] almighty god
[40:03] and he was made dust verse 3
[40:06] who is he that hideth counsel without
[40:08] knowledge therefore have i uttered that
[40:10] i underst
[40:11] what i understood not things too
[40:13] wonderful for me
[40:15] which i knew not here i beseech thee and
[40:18] i will speak i will demand of thee and
[40:19] declare thou unto me
[40:21] i have heard of thee by the hearing of
[40:23] the ear but now mine i
[40:24] see it thee wherefore i abhor myself
[40:28] and repent in dust and ashes
[40:35] no man has any right to tell god what to
[40:38] do
[40:41] no man has any right to question god's
[40:44] authority to do what he will
[40:46] or to call it unfair or unjust or not
[40:49] right
[40:51] are we clear on that because we better
[40:53] get clear on that
[40:55] because we're not clear on that there's
[40:56] going to be one day maybe at the
[40:57] judgment bar that god will make it very
[40:59] clear
[41:00] and i'd rather clear this question up
[41:02] now than then
[41:05] god's in absolute total control
[41:09] and he's the boss and i'm but ash
[41:14] i'm not going to answer i will put my
[41:16] hand over my mouth
[41:18] in the presence of god amen
[41:22] let's go to colossians we're going to
[41:23] look at a couple more verses together
[41:31] colossians chapter 1.
[41:41] colossians chapter 1
[41:45] and verse 15.
[41:49] who is the image of the invisible god
[41:51] the firstborn of every creature
[41:53] for by him were all things created that
[41:55] are in heaven
[41:56] and that are in earth visible and
[41:58] invisible whether they be thrones
[42:00] or dominions or principalities or powers
[42:04] all things were created by him and
[42:07] for him all things
[42:11] what does that mean all things
[42:15] we can interpret greek all things mean
[42:19] all things and all things were made by
[42:22] him
[42:22] and all things remain for him so christ
[42:25] he's talking about christ here christ
[42:27] was not made for you and i
[42:30] he is not our santa claus he is not our
[42:32] genie in a bottle
[42:34] he is not him who we go to when we need
[42:36] healing he is not the one that we go to
[42:37] when we want something
[42:40] we were made for him he was not made for
[42:43] us
[42:44] we serve his will he does not serve our
[42:47] will
[42:49] see we got to adjust our thinking
[42:51] somehow we can do whatever we want but
[42:53] crisis might get out of jail free card
[42:54] as long as i say
[42:55] oh yeah it's under the it's under the
[42:57] it's under the blood
[42:59] it's under the blood if he says it's
[43:01] unto the blood
[43:03] he's god none of us are god
[43:06] let's turn to revelations chapter 4.
[43:13] revelations chapter 4 we'll read verse
[43:16] 10 and 11.
[43:20] the four and 20 elders fall down before
[43:23] him that sat on the throne and worshiped
[43:25] him that liveth forever and ever
[43:26] and cast their crowns before the throne
[43:28] saying thou art worthy o lord to receive
[43:31] glory and honor and power
[43:33] for thou hast created all things and for
[43:35] thy
[43:36] pleasure thy
[43:40] pleasure not
[43:43] our pleasure all things were created
[43:47] by him and for him and for thy
[43:50] pleasure they are and were
[43:54] created
[43:58] even the wicked which he hath made for
[44:01] the day of evil
[44:02] even the vessel fitted to destruction
[44:05] even
[44:06] the brute beast made to be taken and
[44:07] destroyed even they were created
[44:10] for his pleasure
[44:16] brother branham said i love him so much
[44:19] even if he cast me into hell
[44:21] i'll be kissing his feet on the way into
[44:23] hell that's his great reverence and
[44:25] respect for god
[44:26] he wasn't serving god because he got a
[44:28] ticket to heaven he wasn't serving god
[44:30] for all the benefits he wasn't serving
[44:32] god for all the things he could get out
[44:33] of the deal he served god because he
[44:35] loved god
[44:36] so much so that if he was destined for
[44:38] hell he would still love god
[44:40] and still be kissing his feet as he was
[44:42] kicking his face into hell
[44:45] that's the proper approach to god not
[44:50] as the rich young ruler come up to jesus
[44:52] and say what can i do to get eternal
[44:53] life
[44:54] he wanted a deal we don't want a deal
[44:57] we love him we don't deserve a deal
[45:00] we just love him we love him because
[45:03] it's all for him and it's all by him and
[45:05] it's all for his good pleasure
[45:07] and we are his and we know we're his and
[45:08] so we don't reserve anything from him we
[45:10] give ourselves willingly to him
[45:12] because we understand he's lord of all
[45:16] amen
[45:19] let's go to isaiah 46.
[45:25] i just love looking at all the
[45:27] scriptures i thought this
[45:29] would be a great subject for a little
[45:31] bible study this morning
[45:35] isaiah chapter 46
[45:41] and verse 9.
[45:46] remember the former things of old for i
[45:48] am god and there is none else
[45:51] i am god and there is none like me
[45:54] i think that's pretty much what he told
[45:55] job what do you think
[45:58] now he's talking to isaiah i am god and
[46:01] there is none like me
[46:02] declaring the end from the beginning and
[46:05] from ancient times
[46:06] the things that are not yet done saying
[46:09] my counsel
[46:10] shall stand and i will do
[46:13] all my pleasure
[46:18] what's going to happen outside of god's
[46:20] will
[46:24] tell me something that will happen
[46:26] outside of god's will
[46:28] nothing will ever happen outside
[46:31] of god's will
[46:36] there is none like him nobody else can
[46:39] declare from ancient days
[46:40] things that will be but from ancient
[46:43] days
[46:44] he declared things that will be
[46:55] i got a couple quotes here i'm going to
[46:57] read a couple sections out of the church
[46:59] age book
[47:00] and as we get into the book of life i'm
[47:02] going to read some sections out of the
[47:04] church age book and so
[47:05] i'm going to continue on next sunday
[47:07] lord willing and it'd be good if
[47:09] everybody would bring their church age
[47:10] book
[47:11] so if you have one and you want to bring
[47:13] it bring it and what i'll do is tell you
[47:14] the page number i'm reading out of
[47:16] so you can read along with me and so you
[47:18] can highlight mark or do whatever you
[47:19] want
[47:20] and now i've heard from a couple
[47:21] different people that they've called to
[47:23] question the authenticity of the church
[47:24] age book
[47:26] right because we know that brother lee
[47:29] vale was that was the brother that
[47:30] edited the book and he put the book
[47:32] together and he made all the corrections
[47:34] and he grammarized and he did all those
[47:36] things
[47:36] that's true right so there's some people
[47:39] that are afraid
[47:40] that lee vale had a lot of himself
[47:42] injected into this book
[47:44] and that it may not be exactly a hundred
[47:46] percent what brother branham wanted
[47:48] has anybody ever heard that okay
[47:52] i don't believe that because
[47:55] brother branham highly promoted this
[47:57] book told us you ought to get it it'll
[47:59] answer your questions it'll be good for
[48:00] you and all those other things
[48:02] and and why would god have a prophet
[48:05] bring confusion when god is not the
[48:06] author of confusion
[48:08] and why could god not watch over this
[48:10] book
[48:12] right could god not preserve
[48:15] this book could god not withhold it from
[48:18] coming forth it was going to be wrong
[48:20] see we know that they also they also
[48:23] wanted to produce the seven
[48:24] seals brother brandon very much wanted
[48:26] to do the same thing he did to this book
[48:28] he very much wanted to do it with the
[48:30] seven seals
[48:31] how many knows that was his desire take
[48:33] it and he wanted to have it edited
[48:36] in a way that made sense so scholarly
[48:38] people could read it so it wasn't broke
[48:39] up
[48:40] and there's many concepts brother
[48:41] branham teaches over dozens of messages
[48:43] but here he compiled all of that edited
[48:46] and was very concise in the way he
[48:48] brought doctrinal teachings
[48:49] and that's the way he wanted it that was
[48:51] his desire
[48:53] right and he wanted to do the same thing
[48:55] with the seven seals
[48:56] but afterwards they they were going to
[48:59] do the seven seals they wanted to do the
[49:00] seven seals but god didn't let it come
[49:02] to fruit because there was no profit to
[49:03] correct or edit the seven seals
[49:06] but there was a prophet on the scene
[49:08] that was correcting editing and
[49:09] proofreading this book
[49:11] i got a couple quotes that i'll read to
[49:13] you so
[49:14] so you don't think i'm making stuff up
[49:17] 1965 the anointed ones at the end time
[49:20] now lee there there comes your name on
[49:22] the book he's talking about the book of
[49:23] life
[49:24] see you've got it you got it fixed out
[49:27] and you that's not here out in the
[49:29] hookups it's dr
[49:30] lee vale sitting here he's grammarizing
[49:32] this book of the seven church ages
[49:34] and the problem come up with a question
[49:35] about your name taken off the lamb's
[49:37] book of life
[49:38] see it's a puzzled a lot of ministers
[49:40] but wait till you get the book
[49:42] you'll understand it if you just got any
[49:44] light in you see
[49:47] the brother brandon endorsed this book
[49:50] absolutely
[49:52] and you can take this and go back to the
[49:53] message and find it it's just when you
[49:55] find a topic in here
[49:56] you've got to scour years of messages
[49:59] and you'll find it all over
[50:01] but it's really nice to have it
[50:02] condensed and concise
[50:04] amen here's another one in
[50:07] 1965 a man running from the presence of
[50:10] the lord
[50:11] and then the seven church ages has been
[50:12] finished is that right brother veil
[50:14] and on print now and i know you'll want
[50:16] to get them because they answer a lot of
[50:18] questions that's been
[50:20] in your hearts
[50:25] did we read that right
[50:28] the seven churches have been finished
[50:30] and i know you'll want to get them
[50:32] you're going to want to get this book
[50:35] because they answer a lot of questions
[50:37] that's been in your heart
[50:39] something else that you need to
[50:40] understand about this book is this book
[50:41] was still being edited and grammarized
[50:43] through 1965.
[50:45] so brother branham had added the seals
[50:47] into this book it's not just the
[50:49] seven church ages the book is about the
[50:51] seven church ages
[50:52] but after the opening of the seals he
[50:54] injected what was taught in the seals
[50:56] and it goes right into this book as well
[50:59] so this is a post-seals book
[51:03] so the revelations that were unfolded
[51:04] after the seals you will find in this
[51:06] book
[51:07] so this is not secondary to the seals
[51:10] this book is not something that has to
[51:11] be corrected by the seals
[51:13] this book has those truths those
[51:15] mysteries that were under the seven
[51:16] seals
[51:17] are in this book okay
[51:20] so that's why when i read this it might
[51:22] lock somebody up but i don't want to
[51:23] lock anybody up brother branham endorsed
[51:25] this book
[51:26] he edited this book he proofread this
[51:28] book and he said you should get it it'll
[51:29] answer a lot of questions that's in your
[51:31] heart
[51:32] amen and he specifically was talking
[51:34] about the question
[51:36] of the book of life name on the book or
[51:37] having your name removed off the book
[51:39] which is what we're going to get into
[51:40] when we talk about book of life and that
[51:42] specific question he said will be
[51:44] answered in the church age book
[51:47] are we on the same page since that's our
[51:49] questions and that's our topic
[51:50] we're going to go to the place where
[51:52] brother van gogh's do i got tons of
[51:53] other quotes we'll get into as well
[51:55] but that this is where i want to read
[51:56] from
[51:58] so the first place i want to read from
[52:00] is the
[52:03] the sardisian church age and i'm going
[52:05] to read from
[52:06] page 266 about halfway down
[52:10] now we talked about the sovereignty of
[52:12] god and now we're going to attach the
[52:13] sovereignty of god to the book of life
[52:15] we're coming back and picking up our
[52:16] subject book of life
[52:19] the possibility of the removal of a name
[52:21] from the records of god deserves more
[52:23] than a casual study
[52:25] now i want to go back to this quote i
[52:26] read in 1965 the anointed ones at the
[52:29] end time
[52:31] because he says dr level sitting here
[52:33] he's grammarizing this book of the seven
[52:35] church ages
[52:36] and the problem came up or the question
[52:38] about your name taken off the lamb's
[52:40] book of life
[52:41] and i just read the possibility of the
[52:44] removal of a name from the records of
[52:45] god deserves more than a casual study
[52:47] so he's saying here is the question
[52:51] about name taken off the book of life
[52:56] it's puzzled a lot of ministers but wait
[52:58] till you get the book
[53:00] and you'll understand it if you just got
[53:02] any light in you see
[53:04] there's the question but he's telling us
[53:06] to go here for the answer
[53:09] to that specific question about name
[53:11] taken off the book
[53:12] that's why i'm going to read from here
[53:15] the possibility the removal of a name
[53:16] from the records of god deserves more
[53:18] than a casual study
[53:19] and he goes from here all the way
[53:21] through to the end of this chapter and
[53:22] he does 20 pages on this study
[53:25] right here for up until now most
[53:28] students have merely drawn a conclusion
[53:30] that god places the names of those born
[53:32] again within the lamb's book of life
[53:34] at the time of their rebirth and if for
[53:36] any reason that name must be removed the
[53:38] space on the record will simply be blank
[53:40] as it was before a name had been placed
[53:42] there this is 100
[53:45] opposite to what the word actually
[53:47] teaches
[53:50] at the very start of our study let it be
[53:52] known that there is not one
[53:54] scripture that teaches that god is
[53:57] presently
[53:58] compiling a record of names this was all
[54:01] done before the foundation of the world
[54:03] as we will point out shortly so
[54:07] there is no there god is not adding
[54:09] names to the book of life
[54:11] god is not watching over the banister of
[54:13] heaven waiting for people to come to the
[54:15] altar
[54:16] and he's not oh they're coming they're
[54:18] coming they're coming
[54:20] shh don't move they're at the old
[54:24] they confessed my name
[54:27] right i'm on the book i'm so happy they
[54:29] came
[54:31] god is not doing that god
[54:35] knew that they would come before the
[54:37] foundation of the world
[54:38] and then he put their name on the book
[54:40] and then he determined that he was going
[54:42] to
[54:43] seal them by the blood of the cross then
[54:46] back then that the shed blood of the
[54:48] lamb was going to be the purchase price
[54:49] for all those on the book finn
[54:53] and he hasn't added a name since
[54:59] so if you believe by faith that your
[55:00] name is on that book
[55:06] did you have to do with it
[55:09] and what can you do about it nothing
[55:12] just serve god
[55:14] amen let's keep going
[55:20] 1961 brother branham says abraham's
[55:22] grace covenant
[55:24] when was the lamb slain 2 000 years ago
[55:26] in calvary
[55:27] not in god's sight
[55:31] he was the lamb slain from the
[55:32] foundation of the world
[55:34] when god saw what satan had done his
[55:36] program was laid out
[55:37] and he knowed that he would send his son
[55:39] and he would be a propitiation for our
[55:41] sins
[55:42] and in the mind of jehovah in the mind
[55:45] of jehovah
[55:46] to conquer and keep his people he slayed
[55:48] the lamb in his own mind before the
[55:50] foundation of the world and put your
[55:51] name on the book as redeemed
[55:54] glory that's what he done
[55:57] god did that
[56:01] then what are you scared about
[56:05] then what are you scared about see
[56:08] god's not here for us we're here for god
[56:13] god's not here to exercise his authority
[56:16] on our will
[56:17] by our what we ask for and what we want
[56:20] out of this life
[56:21] he's not here to exercise his power and
[56:23] authority and dominion
[56:24] on our will we are here
[56:28] to express his will
[56:31] and when we express his will and come
[56:34] into a place of need
[56:36] whether it be for healing or financial
[56:38] help or a crisis in our lives
[56:39] if we are expressing his will because
[56:42] we're in a fallen state and in a fallen
[56:43] world
[56:44] he paid the price with the sacrifice
[56:45] that would release to us power by the
[56:47] purchase of the blood
[56:48] to help us in our time of need not
[56:50] because we want it but because we're in
[56:52] the process of expressing his will
[56:54] and coming to a place where we need
[56:56] healing in our body to continue to
[56:58] express his will
[57:00] so he purchased for us healing so that
[57:02] he could apply healing to
[57:03] us according to his purpose and his
[57:07] pleasure
[57:09] not because we really really really want
[57:10] to be healed
[57:13] isn't that true if we could just adjust
[57:16] our thinking
[57:16] brother branham said you want god to
[57:18] heal you what for
[57:20] what's your motive in asking him what's
[57:22] your objective in being healed
[57:24] just so you can go on and make more
[57:25] money and just so you could live longer
[57:27] and prosper
[57:27] or watch your will what's your purpose
[57:30] god i'm down here trying to serve you as
[57:32] best as i can
[57:33] i'm leading my family i'm working in the
[57:35] church i'm witnessing i'm trying to be a
[57:37] lie
[57:37] and here satan is trying to hinder me
[57:40] and the work you've called me to do
[57:41] would you please heal me so that i can
[57:43] continue on in your will
[57:45] he said that's how to get what you asked
[57:47] for that's how to bring god on the scene
[57:50] it's not about us it's about him
[57:55] we've got to adjust our thinking he's
[57:57] not up there
[57:58] just saying oh who's going to use my
[58:00] power today and he's at the
[58:02] he's at the whim and call of every one
[58:04] of his children who will call on him
[58:06] and he must go into action just because
[58:08] we say something
[58:11] that's why we must pray in the spirit
[58:13] for the spirit knoweth the mind of god
[58:25] in 1954 in the message the unconditional
[58:27] covenant that god made with his people
[58:30] one day abraham no more than any other
[58:32] man maybe as far as we know
[58:34] coming out of babylon perhaps an
[58:36] idolater
[58:37] but god by election
[58:40] god does the choosing we can't
[58:43] choose
[58:47] we can't choose
[58:50] god does the choosing we have nothing
[58:54] to do with it
[58:57] how can you lose it
[59:02] man said oh brother i sought god i saw
[59:04] no
[59:05] man never sought god not in a man to
[59:08] seek god
[59:09] no man at any time or at any age ever
[59:12] sought
[59:16] god
[59:18] you know a lot of people will say i
[59:20] accepted jesus as my savior today
[59:22] i accepted god the question is has god
[59:26] accepted you that's the question
[59:31] because if your name is not on that book
[59:32] it doesn't matter how many times you
[59:34] accept god or you accept christ or you
[59:36] accept calvary
[59:37] if your name is not on that book by
[59:38] accepting something you can't put your
[59:40] name on that book
[59:41] the question is has god accepted you and
[59:46] how do you know when god has accepted
[59:47] you brother branham told us in the token
[59:49] if god has accepted your faith he gives
[59:51] you the seal of the baptism of the holy
[59:53] ghost as a token
[59:54] evidence that he has received your faith
[59:58] it's not everybody that says of their
[1:00:00] own will and their desire
[1:00:02] that i'm saved or i have christ it's not
[1:00:04] that at all because it's not by our own
[1:00:05] will our own desire
[1:00:06] it's by his will and his desire that's
[1:00:09] why he placed names on a book before the
[1:00:11] foundation of the world
[1:00:12] and that's why he presented the token in
[1:00:14] this day to give his children his
[1:00:16] believing children
[1:00:17] evidence that their faith has been
[1:00:19] accepted and the blood has been applied
[1:00:21] that's what the message token is all
[1:00:23] about
[1:00:25] amen we never sought god
[1:00:28] not in a man to seek god no man at any
[1:00:30] time or at any age ever sought god
[1:00:32] it's just vice versa it's god
[1:00:36] seeking the man not man seeking god
[1:00:41] jesus said no man can come to me except
[1:00:43] my father draws him
[1:00:44] is that right john 6 37 says all that
[1:00:47] the father giveth me shall come to me
[1:00:49] and him that cometh to me i will in no
[1:00:51] wise cast out
[1:00:55] john 6 43 jesus answered therefore
[1:00:57] answered and said unto him murmur not
[1:00:59] among yourselves
[1:01:00] no man can come to me except the father
[1:01:02] which has sent me draw him
[1:01:03] and i will raise him up at the last day
[1:01:07] how is it that you're being drawn to
[1:01:08] christ by the will of god
[1:01:12] john 15 16 jesus talking to his
[1:01:15] disciples
[1:01:17] ye have not chosen me
[1:01:22] but i have chosen you
[1:01:28] you know when jesus went to the
[1:01:30] disciples and different ones and he was
[1:01:31] he was going out
[1:01:32] and he was inviting them to come along
[1:01:34] or they were just deciding to come along
[1:01:36] like john and
[1:01:38] and all the others i'm sure they were
[1:01:40] making choices they were making
[1:01:42] decisions in their life
[1:01:44] shall i drop the net and leave my
[1:01:45] father's business or should i stay here
[1:01:47] and help him
[1:01:48] should i follow this that i believe is
[1:01:51] messiah this prophet of god
[1:01:52] or should i stay they're making choices
[1:01:54] in their life and they're
[1:01:56] choosing whether or not they'll stay or
[1:01:57] whether or not they'll go they're
[1:01:58] choosing whether or not they'll accept
[1:02:00] his invitation
[1:02:01] they're choosing whether or not they'll
[1:02:02] go and be a disciple of the lord
[1:02:05] or so they think they're choosing
[1:02:11] but he says you have not chosen me but i
[1:02:13] have chosen you
[1:02:15] and ordained you that you should go
[1:02:18] and bring forth fruit and that your
[1:02:20] fruit shall remain that
[1:02:21] whatsoever you shall ask of the father
[1:02:24] in my name
[1:02:24] he may give it to you
[1:02:28] who determined that jesus christ
[1:02:30] determine that
[1:02:32] amen we don't get to decide those things
[1:02:36] it wasn't adam that was looking for god
[1:02:39] when he sinned
[1:02:40] it was god who came into the garden that
[1:02:41] was seeking out adam and it's been that
[1:02:43] way
[1:02:44] ever since how many
[1:02:47] come into the message from another
[1:02:48] denomination or from the world
[1:02:50] raise your hand okay were you looking
[1:02:54] for more truth more light and a further
[1:02:56] revelation of jesus christ
[1:02:59] were you seeking god to know the opening
[1:03:02] of the seven seals
[1:03:05] i'm same way i didn't even know to care
[1:03:09] it's not that i didn't care
[1:03:10] i didn't know anything about anything so
[1:03:12] there was nothing to care about
[1:03:15] it wasn't me who sought out god it was
[1:03:18] god who sought
[1:03:19] me out and how about all of you who was
[1:03:21] it that sought you out
[1:03:23] were you on the hunt looking for a
[1:03:25] further revelation of christ were you on
[1:03:26] the hunt
[1:03:27] looking for the the the mystery of
[1:03:30] predestination were you on the hunt
[1:03:31] looking to be sealed into the eternal
[1:03:33] kingdom are we just going about your
[1:03:35] business
[1:03:36] living life like you've always lived
[1:03:38] life doing what you always do
[1:03:39] and god comes down and hunted you out
[1:03:44] hallelujah and we want to ask questions
[1:03:47] about well who didn't get to hear and
[1:03:48] who this and who that and who that
[1:03:50] is god god he knows where his seed is he
[1:03:53] know where the seed fell into the ground
[1:03:55] he knows where to put the water and he
[1:03:56] knows where to put the light and he
[1:03:58] knows that if it's seed
[1:03:59] and it gets water and it gets light it
[1:04:00] springs forth to life
[1:04:02] it's the human perspective they'll say
[1:04:04] but what about the millions of people
[1:04:06] who never heard about the message
[1:04:07] that's god's business that's not our
[1:04:09] business the same god who sought you out
[1:04:11] and the same god who sought me out
[1:04:13] is the same god who will seek out every
[1:04:16] single
[1:04:17] predestinated seed of god and bring it
[1:04:19] to life
[1:04:22] we're just lucky to be a part of it in
[1:04:25] missions work or witnessing or sharing
[1:04:27] with friends or passing on a book or a
[1:04:28] track we're just lucky to be part of it
[1:04:30] but it's not
[1:04:31] us and it's not them it's all him
[1:04:35] amen it's the sovereignty
[1:04:38] of god
[1:04:42] we worry about things we ought not to
[1:04:43] worry about
[1:04:45] we should just leave things in god's
[1:04:52] hands
[1:04:54] brother branham in this church age book
[1:04:55] he's talking about
[1:04:57] the vessels fitted to destruction he's
[1:04:59] talking about the wicked reserved into
[1:05:01] the day of judgment he's talking about
[1:05:03] god has created all things
[1:05:04] even the wicked for the day of evil and
[1:05:06] after he goes through that he's talking
[1:05:07] about the different categories
[1:05:08] of those who are in the book of life who
[1:05:10] are not in the book of life or have been
[1:05:11] removed from the book of life
[1:05:13] he gets to this section in the sardisian
[1:05:15] church age this is page 281 if you want
[1:05:17] to write it down in the middle
[1:05:19] it says since this portion of the word
[1:05:21] is hard for the human mind to grasp
[1:05:24] i would say that's true why
[1:05:27] because we're in a fallen flesh we don't
[1:05:30] see from god's perspective
[1:05:32] we don't see the whole plan we don't
[1:05:34] understand how all the puzzle pieces fit
[1:05:36] together perfectly
[1:05:38] we see inconsistencies we see problems
[1:05:40] we see
[1:05:41] injustice we see unfairness we see
[1:05:44] things that cause our heart to maybe
[1:05:46] say ah i don't know about that oh i
[1:05:48] don't like that
[1:05:50] that's why it's hard for the human mind
[1:05:52] it's because our perspective and our
[1:05:54] condition
[1:05:56] fallen flesh and an earthly carnal
[1:05:58] perspective
[1:06:00] right that's why we have to receive
[1:06:03] the baptism of the holy ghost and we
[1:06:05] have to receive
[1:06:06] newness of mind we have to receive the
[1:06:09] mind of christ
[1:06:11] all right since this portion of the word
[1:06:13] is hard for the human mind to grasp
[1:06:15] it must be accepted and believed by
[1:06:18] faith
[1:06:21] some will be offended by what i have set
[1:06:23] forth because they fail to understand
[1:06:25] the sovereignty of god which sets forth
[1:06:28] that god
[1:06:29] is god
[1:06:32] and i am glad that he is god
[1:06:37] he goes back to brother branham saying
[1:06:39] if god had not
[1:06:40] chosen psalm none would be saved
[1:06:44] because no man's ever at any time sought
[1:06:46] god it's god that sought man
[1:06:48] no man has ever had a desire to god it's
[1:06:50] god that had a desire to man
[1:06:51] man's had a desire to religion man's had
[1:06:53] a desire to worship but not a desire for
[1:06:56] the true
[1:06:56] revelation of the truth of god he's had
[1:06:59] a desire for a god of his own
[1:07:00] imagination
[1:07:01] and men all over the world the muslims
[1:07:03] and the hindus and the sikhs and
[1:07:05] even the christian religions they all
[1:07:07] have a desire
[1:07:09] to worship a god of their imagination
[1:07:12] but they don't have a desire to worship
[1:07:14] the god of the universe
[1:07:16] the one and only god creator god
[1:07:21] that's why it must be believed by faith
[1:07:23] because they fail to understand the
[1:07:24] sovereignty god which sets forth that
[1:07:25] god is god
[1:07:26] and because he is god one cannot defeat
[1:07:29] his counsels or
[1:07:30] thought his will and purpose but he
[1:07:32] being omnipotent is ruling in all
[1:07:34] affairs
[1:07:35] and is doing whatever he will with all
[1:07:37] his creation because all were created
[1:07:39] for his good pleasure
[1:07:41] further down he says that he would that
[1:07:43] he has the right to do this on the
[1:07:45] grounds of creation alone
[1:07:46] we cannot deny can you deny that
[1:07:50] who made it who has the right to decide
[1:07:55] right it'd be like if a sister here in
[1:07:59] the church made two apple pies
[1:08:01] right and she decided to give one
[1:08:04] to another family and she decides to
[1:08:06] give one
[1:08:07] to the neighbor and her kids come in
[1:08:10] hey that's not fair we want apple pie
[1:08:16] why did you give that one there and
[1:08:17] why'd you get that one to wear and mom
[1:08:19] looks and says
[1:08:20] hey i made the pie i can give it to
[1:08:24] whoever i want
[1:08:27] and god made everything
[1:08:31] and he can do with it whatever he
[1:08:33] chooses
[1:08:34] and if we take that away from god that's
[1:08:36] a god that i don't want to serve
[1:08:38] i don't want to serve a god that has to
[1:08:40] buckle under the pressure of a bunch of
[1:08:41] people praying
[1:08:45] i don't want to serve a god that'll
[1:08:47] change his mind because a lot of people
[1:08:49] don't think it's fair or just or it
[1:08:50] doesn't seem right
[1:08:51] i don't want to serve that kind of god i
[1:08:54] want to serve a god who knew the end
[1:08:55] from the beginning
[1:08:56] i want to serve a god who determined
[1:08:57] what was going to happen before the
[1:08:58] foundation of the world
[1:08:59] and will never change his mind
[1:09:03] that's the god i want to serve even if
[1:09:05] it means i'm outside of his plan
[1:09:08] that's still the god i want to serve
[1:09:11] because if god's not god there's no hope
[1:09:14] for all of us
[1:09:15] the only hope for any of us is that god
[1:09:18] will remain god
[1:09:24] yet he went even further for according
[1:09:26] so back up
[1:09:27] he has the right to do with with this on
[1:09:30] the grounds
[1:09:30] of creation alone he's got the right to
[1:09:32] do whatever he wants on the grounds of
[1:09:34] creation alone we cannot deny
[1:09:35] yet he went even further for according
[1:09:38] to romans 14
[1:09:39] 7-9 we have the irrefutable proof that
[1:09:41] jesus paid the purchase price of the
[1:09:43] whole world
[1:09:44] and therefore he can do as he wills with
[1:09:47] his own
[1:09:49] he's got double rights one he created it
[1:09:52] and secondly he spilled his blood to pay
[1:09:55] for it all to buy it all back
[1:09:57] what can he not do
[1:10:02] if he wanted to cast you in the hell
[1:10:03] what would you do about it
[1:10:07] what could you possibly say to thwart
[1:10:10] his will
[1:10:11] his will will be done
[1:10:15] period and his will
[1:10:18] is not changing period
[1:10:22] his will was determined on days of old
[1:10:24] in ancient times
[1:10:25] before the foundation of this world
[1:10:27] we're standing on that's when his will
[1:10:29] and purpose was determined
[1:10:31] and he's not going to change at all
[1:10:36] further down now if we impute
[1:10:38] omniscience to god
[1:10:40] we must also accept that he is perfect
[1:10:42] in wisdom
[1:10:43] and righteousness this plan of election
[1:10:47] and reprobation
[1:10:48] is the wisdom of god revealed in all
[1:10:51] ages
[1:10:54] we must trust god
[1:10:58] we must trust the determinate counsel of
[1:11:00] his own will
[1:11:01] we must trust that he is full of wisdom
[1:11:04] perfect in wisdom
[1:11:05] and perfect in righteousness and that he
[1:11:07] is perfectly just and that he is
[1:11:09] perfectly fair
[1:11:10] and that he will always do what's right
[1:11:13] you have to trust that
[1:11:14] it doesn't always look that way right
[1:11:17] through the human mind it doesn't always
[1:11:18] look that way
[1:11:19] but it's absolutely that way
[1:11:30] brother branham says and he that is in
[1:11:32] you 1963
[1:11:34] and no one can be redeemed unless they
[1:11:37] were put on the lamb's book of life
[1:11:38] before the foundation of the world
[1:11:40] who are they i don't know it's the
[1:11:42] prophet of god
[1:11:43] who are they i don't know nobody else
[1:11:46] knows see just god alone
[1:11:47] i'm trusting that every one of us our
[1:11:50] names were on that book
[1:11:51] if mine was on there i'm sure to be
[1:11:53] there
[1:11:55] if it wasn't i won't be there
[1:12:00] this is the prophet of god talking
[1:12:02] that's all see
[1:12:03] just that's just up to god it's not him
[1:12:05] that willeth
[1:12:06] or him that runeth but god that showeth
[1:12:09] mercy
[1:12:12] so we start to look at this fair and not
[1:12:15] fair and
[1:12:16] how could this and how could that but
[1:12:18] there's something that brother branham
[1:12:19] injects in the third seal that i found
[1:12:21] to be very comforting and very helpful
[1:12:23] and the third seal in 1963 he says now
[1:12:26] he never noticed that before why he had
[1:12:28] been back there doing his mediatorial
[1:12:30] work
[1:12:30] for he was bleeding for the people
[1:12:32] intercession for the people until the
[1:12:33] last soul that was put in the lamb's
[1:12:35] book of life
[1:12:36] before the foundation of the world come
[1:12:37] in there's just going to be so many of
[1:12:40] them there
[1:12:40] and that's it that's all this is what he
[1:12:43] said
[1:12:44] the others won't even want to come in
[1:12:47] they have no desire to come in
[1:12:51] it's not that they're begging to be part
[1:12:53] of the bride
[1:12:54] oh please please please please make me
[1:12:56] part of the bride and he says
[1:12:58] nah they don't even have the desire
[1:13:02] to come in and submit their life
[1:13:04] completely to christ
[1:13:06] right because how can you come unless he
[1:13:10] draws you and if he draws you and gives
[1:13:13] you a desire what a great consolation
[1:13:15] that you're a part of it
[1:13:18] if he's calling you and you have a
[1:13:20] desire those
[1:13:21] those don't even have a desire now i
[1:13:24] know that you say well there's a
[1:13:25] there's there's thousands and thousands
[1:13:26] of people to believe the message they
[1:13:28] surely are not all bride no they're not
[1:13:29] but see it's not that they have a great
[1:13:31] love or a desire for
[1:13:32] some people are serving god in the
[1:13:34] message of the hour out of fear
[1:13:37] because they're afraid if i don't
[1:13:38] believe this i'll be cast out are afraid
[1:13:40] i have to line up to this and i better
[1:13:42] get all this right
[1:13:43] that's not a desire to have him that's
[1:13:46] not a desire to know him that's not a
[1:13:47] desire for him
[1:13:49] that's a desire to be safe because i'm
[1:13:52] afraid
[1:13:53] if i move from this i won't be safe
[1:13:55] don't worry god will rearrange the
[1:13:56] circumstances till all that gets purged
[1:13:58] out by the end time
[1:14:00] all right but there's some who are
[1:14:02] serving out of fear that's not what he's
[1:14:04] talking about
[1:14:05] but those with a great inward desire and
[1:14:07] a love for god
[1:14:08] who desire to be part of the bride do i
[1:14:10] be identified to be with christ
[1:14:12] to be indwelled with a very living god
[1:14:14] those people who desire that more than
[1:14:16] life
[1:14:17] those are the one whose it's for not the
[1:14:20] ones who are afraid of being on the
[1:14:21] outside and left behind
[1:14:22] fear is no motivator here fear will not
[1:14:25] get you what you want fear does not come
[1:14:26] from god that's not it
[1:14:29] but inside oh there's something there
[1:14:32] you can't shake it you can't deny it you
[1:14:35] didn't put it there
[1:14:36] you didn't buy it you can't sell it you
[1:14:38] didn't trade for it nobody's taking out
[1:14:40] but inside of you is a longing for god
[1:14:43] a longing for christ not the god of my
[1:14:45] imagination because every time i see him
[1:14:47] revealed in his word
[1:14:48] i love him more even when it's contrary
[1:14:51] to what i used to think
[1:14:52] i deny what i used to think and i love
[1:14:54] him more
[1:14:55] every time i hear the prophet of god say
[1:14:57] something that's totally opposite the
[1:14:58] way i thought it was
[1:14:59] i reject my thinking and i accept what
[1:15:01] he said because i love him more
[1:15:03] because of the desire that's in my heart
[1:15:05] i'm not serving a god of my own
[1:15:06] imagination
[1:15:07] i'm not serving a god of my own makeup
[1:15:10] i'm serving the god
[1:15:11] of the universe who happened to come
[1:15:14] down in this age and share
[1:15:16] what's been laying in the back part of
[1:15:18] his mind all down to redemption
[1:15:19] and he began to speak it and share it
[1:15:21] through his mouthpiece and those that
[1:15:23] have a desire unto him
[1:15:24] love it they're not afraid to not be
[1:15:28] part of it
[1:15:29] they're not afraid that they have to
[1:15:30] accept certain doctrines oh i've got to
[1:15:32] step servants here and i've got to be
[1:15:33] baptized in the in the name of jesus
[1:15:34] christ i've got to accept that i
[1:15:35] prophecy him or else i'm going to lose
[1:15:37] it
[1:15:37] that's not it you don't have it yet
[1:15:40] but when god drops in there that seed of
[1:15:42] eternal life that was there
[1:15:44] when you were born it was there before
[1:15:46] you were born it was designated to be
[1:15:48] but in the soul there's laying
[1:15:49] that germ of life and there's something
[1:15:52] that gets quickened
[1:15:53] by the word of the hour and you can
[1:15:55] never erase that thing
[1:15:58] now if you were serving god because of a
[1:16:00] love for a spouse if you're serving god
[1:16:02] because of a love for a mom and dad
[1:16:03] if you're serving a god because of a
[1:16:05] love of the church or you're in the
[1:16:06] message because you're afraid not to be
[1:16:08] then that's not the quickening of the
[1:16:10] seed
[1:16:12] but when the seeds quicken even if my
[1:16:14] spouse disbelieves even if my parents
[1:16:16] disbelieve even if my children all fall
[1:16:18] away
[1:16:19] even if every single person in the
[1:16:21] church falls away
[1:16:22] i still have a desire to him
[1:16:27] hallelujah and if you can find yourself
[1:16:30] in that
[1:16:30] position what have you to be afraid of
[1:16:35] but if you find your position in serving
[1:16:37] because of another one
[1:16:39] or submitting to certain things because
[1:16:41] i'm afraid not to
[1:16:43] if you find yourself in that position
[1:16:45] you need to pray
[1:16:47] say god i don't have it yet and god if
[1:16:50] there's a seed
[1:16:51] of eternal life laying in here lord let
[1:16:53] it come to life
[1:16:55] i need to be motivated by something
[1:16:57] other than human emotion human love
[1:16:59] affection for people
[1:17:00] i need to be motivated by something
[1:17:02] other than intellectual understanding i
[1:17:03] need to be motivated by something other
[1:17:05] than i'm afraid to not be part of it i
[1:17:07] need to be motivated by your love
[1:17:11] amen we need to pray that god will
[1:17:13] quicken that
[1:17:15] and that the desire will be the desire
[1:17:16] of the heart not the desire of the mind
[1:17:19] not the desire the human spirit realm
[1:17:21] but the desire of the soul
[1:17:24] but oh if it's the desire of the soul
[1:17:29] what consolation
[1:17:32] what consolation it is
[1:17:35] that the sovereign god of the universe
[1:17:39] placed inside just a few people on the
[1:17:42] planet
[1:17:44] not masses not the majority but just a
[1:17:47] few people on the planet
[1:17:50] he dropped something inside of him
[1:17:53] that he knew would be there from before
[1:17:55] the foundation of the world
[1:17:56] and he placed something there that would
[1:17:59] quicken the life
[1:18:00] when they come in contact with the
[1:18:01] revealed word
[1:18:03] and it would sprout and that they would
[1:18:06] have a desire
[1:18:08] to be united with christ
[1:18:11] what consolation if you find that in
[1:18:14] your soul today
[1:18:15] what consolation
[1:18:24] ii peter 2 9 says the lord knoweth how
[1:18:27] to deliver the godly
[1:18:28] out of temptations and how to reserve
[1:18:31] the unjust
[1:18:32] unto the day of judgment to be punished
[1:18:35] god knows how to do that
[1:18:37] we look at that and say oh reserve the
[1:18:40] unjust
[1:18:41] unto the day of judgment to be punished
[1:18:43] that's so sad what's the first half of
[1:18:45] the verse
[1:18:47] god the lord knoweth how to deliver
[1:18:51] the godly out of temptations
[1:18:55] hallelujah if you're part of him he
[1:18:58] knows how to deliver you out of every
[1:19:00] temptation
[1:19:01] out of every trial out of every hardship
[1:19:03] out of every doubt
[1:19:04] out of every circumstance you find
[1:19:06] yourself in it's the lord who knows how
[1:19:07] to deliver you out why
[1:19:09] because before the foundation of the
[1:19:10] world his desire was to you
[1:19:14] and he's not going to change his mind
[1:19:16] just because you're in a trial or you're
[1:19:18] in a temptation
[1:19:19] or you're failing amen
[1:19:24] let's look at romans chapter eight
[1:19:28] let's all stand musicians and brother
[1:19:32] asking if you want to come
[1:19:34] we'll read this last section together
[1:19:36] romans chapter 8
[1:19:38] and verse 29.
[1:19:46] let's start at verse 28 8 28 and we know
[1:19:49] that all things work together for good
[1:19:51] to them that love god to them who are
[1:19:54] the called according to his purpose this
[1:19:57] is one reason i don't like other bible
[1:19:58] translations and other versions of the
[1:20:00] bible
[1:20:00] because you know what it changes that
[1:20:04] to not be called but just called
[1:20:07] but you know what there are a v called
[1:20:10] people on the earth
[1:20:14] 29 for whom he did for whom he did for
[1:20:17] no he
[1:20:18] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:20:20] the image of his son
[1:20:21] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:20:23] many brethren moreover whom he did
[1:20:25] predestinate them he also called and
[1:20:28] whom he called them he also justified
[1:20:30] and whom he justified then he also
[1:20:33] glorified
[1:20:36] it's finished in the mind of god the
[1:20:39] whole work
[1:20:40] is finished we've already come into
[1:20:43] glorification
[1:20:44] why because it's his mind now verse 31
[1:20:49] what shall we then say to these things
[1:20:53] if god before us who can be against us
[1:20:59] if in the mind of god we're foreknown
[1:21:03] predestinated called glorified
[1:21:07] well what are we going to say to those
[1:21:08] things if god before us
[1:21:12] who can be against us i can never
[1:21:16] fail if i find myself in that place
[1:21:19] amen what a consolation you know
[1:21:22] if you're not sure if you're in that
[1:21:24] place if you just don't know
[1:21:26] if you have questions you don't know if
[1:21:28] it's for you something on the inside has
[1:21:30] to quicken
[1:21:31] come to life so the desire is not fear
[1:21:34] the desire is not human
[1:21:35] the desire is not intellect but the
[1:21:37] desire is a god-given desire that come
[1:21:39] from before the foundation of the world
[1:21:41] that is drawing you
[1:21:42] back to the place where you came from
[1:21:44] back to origins
[1:21:46] why is it why is it when you when you
[1:21:49] hear the message of the hour
[1:21:50] you know for me when i was hearing it i
[1:21:52] wasn't so much liking it
[1:21:56] went contrary to everything that i ever
[1:21:57] thought not everything but most
[1:21:59] everything that i ever thought about the
[1:22:00] bible was true
[1:22:01] this was backwards that it was opposite
[1:22:03] it was going the opposite direction
[1:22:04] and it was uncomfortable and i didn't
[1:22:06] like it and all those things that go
[1:22:08] with it
[1:22:09] but something down deep no matter how
[1:22:12] much my mind and my flesh resisted
[1:22:15] something down deep when i was hearing
[1:22:18] oh i couldn't explain it it scared me
[1:22:22] it scared me i would pray on my knees
[1:22:25] lord help me not to believe in false
[1:22:27] doctrine
[1:22:27] help me not to believe in a false
[1:22:29] prophet oh god you've got to spare me
[1:22:31] because i knew there was something
[1:22:32] inside of me that was so attracted to
[1:22:34] what i was hearing on the tapes and it
[1:22:36] was so contrary to my mind
[1:22:37] i was scared to death
[1:22:40] it frightened me it wasn't like i went
[1:22:42] running for the message with everything
[1:22:44] that's in me
[1:22:44] i couldn't stay away because i would
[1:22:48] have
[1:22:48] my first inclination was turn and run
[1:22:50] bolt this is different this is weird
[1:22:52] this is false but there's a resonation
[1:22:56] inside of me
[1:22:57] that that word resonates when that words
[1:22:59] preach and when i hear those tapes
[1:23:01] it's hitting something not between my
[1:23:03] ears it's hitting something so deep in
[1:23:05] me it's calling
[1:23:06] forth for a life and it's calling the
[1:23:09] life out that's laying in the seed
[1:23:10] and it's calling it and calling it and
[1:23:13] calling it and i can't do anything but
[1:23:15] respond to it
[1:23:17] amen that's why we're here because we're
[1:23:19] responding to the call for the coming
[1:23:21] forth of the life
[1:23:22] that's laying in the seat and what's
[1:23:24] calling it to come forth
[1:23:25] the sunlight this bright sunlight and
[1:23:29] the water of the word and the presence
[1:23:30] of god
[1:23:31] is calling for that seed to produce and
[1:23:34] to come forth
[1:23:35] and all we're doing is responding we
[1:23:38] recede before we ever hit the earth
[1:23:41] and we'll be seed long after we leave
[1:23:42] the earth
[1:23:44] how many find ourselves there what a
[1:23:47] consolation to us
[1:23:50] let's just sing that song can we sing he
[1:23:52] knows my name
[1:23:53] you know 1006 is the number
[1:23:57] [Music]
[1:24:00] i have a maker
[1:24:06] he formed my heart began
[1:24:17] my life was in
[1:24:20] his hand
[1:24:24] he knows my name
[1:24:30] he knows my every thought
[1:24:36] he sees each tear that falls
[1:24:41] and he hears me
[1:24:45] [Music]
[1:24:54] he calls me
[1:24:59] [Music]
[1:25:12] he knows my name
[1:25:17] he knows my every thought
[1:25:23] he sees
[1:25:27] [Music]
[1:25:35] if that song is true for you right
[1:25:39] and only you know nobody else can tell
[1:25:41] you
[1:25:42] but when you sing the words of that song
[1:25:44] only you know if they're true or not
[1:25:48] and if you can sing that with faith
[1:25:50] knowing it's true
[1:25:52] what in the world are we afraid of
[1:25:55] there's nothing to fear there's nothing
[1:25:57] to worry about there's no
[1:25:59] anxiety there's no fear there's no
[1:26:02] stress
[1:26:02] there's no pressure in that revelation
[1:26:06] so when we experience stress and
[1:26:08] pressure and anxiety and fear and
[1:26:10] depression
[1:26:10] it's because somehow the the world has
[1:26:13] moved us away from that reality
[1:26:15] and we have to continually stay in the
[1:26:16] word until we keep bringing
[1:26:18] our whole reality back to this truth i
[1:26:22] have a maker he knows my name
[1:26:26] he formed my heart he had to know my
[1:26:28] name because he had to know what he was
[1:26:29] going to write on his book before the
[1:26:30] foundation world because i know
[1:26:32] i'm on the book hallelujah
[1:26:35] do you know it for sure no i've never
[1:26:37] read the book but there's something in
[1:26:38] my heart that says i'm there
[1:26:40] by faith i believe i'm there by faith
[1:26:42] it's a reality to me it's not a
[1:26:44] mysterious just
[1:26:45] mystical little vapor of a fairy tale
[1:26:48] it's a reality
[1:26:50] where is it a reality brother chad in my
[1:26:52] heart
[1:26:53] it's real you can't take it away
[1:26:57] hallelujah we should be the happiest
[1:27:00] freest
[1:27:01] most delivered people on the face of the
[1:27:03] planet
[1:27:04] god has never at any time done so much
[1:27:06] to prove
[1:27:08] to prove to a people who he is and what
[1:27:11] truth is
[1:27:12] and where they fit into that truth as he
[1:27:13] has in our day
[1:27:16] we should be absolutely liberated from
[1:27:18] this world
[1:27:19] hallelujah i for one am ready for the
[1:27:23] final liberation
[1:27:25] when this old vile form is changed into
[1:27:28] one like in his form
[1:27:30] and i go to meet him in the air that's
[1:27:33] the day
[1:27:34] that i'm longing for that's my focus
[1:27:37] hallelujah
[1:27:39] amen well we have the results
[1:27:43] for the vote of confirmation from
[1:27:44] brother steve golden and by a vast vast
[1:27:47] majority brother steve has been
[1:27:49] confirmed
[1:27:50] by the body of the congregation as a
[1:27:52] deacon in this church
[1:27:53] and we just believe that we have found
[1:27:55] the perfect mind of god
[1:28:01] [Applause]
[1:28:02] [Music]
[1:28:04] i think it'd be appropriate this time if
[1:28:05] we just prayed with brother steve
[1:28:07] brother steve could you come
[1:28:08] down and the deacons and ministers you
[1:28:10] want to come forward we just like to lay
[1:28:11] hands on brother steve
[1:28:13] you know what brother steve has done and
[1:28:17] him and his family included his wife
[1:28:18] and children with him they have not got
[1:28:21] a promotion
[1:28:24] right they have not moved up in status
[1:28:26] in life they have not gained power and
[1:28:28] authority what they've done
[1:28:29] is they've opened themselves up for an
[1:28:31] attack from the devil because they
[1:28:33] decided to serve the body of jesus
[1:28:34] christ in a greater way than they have
[1:28:36] today
[1:28:37] and we want to pray that god would hedge
[1:28:39] them about with protection
[1:28:40] that god would give our brother divine
[1:28:42] wisdom of the holy ghost
[1:28:44] to administer the office that he now
[1:28:46] holds so we want to pray as
[1:28:48] a body of believers let's just gather
[1:28:49] around right here with brother steve
[1:28:54] come in close brothers
[1:28:58] dear heavenly father we lay hands on our
[1:29:01] brothers a confirmation of your divine
[1:29:03] will
[1:29:04] and we believe lord we've received your
[1:29:05] mind and that brother steve is the
[1:29:07] vessel that you have chosen to fill this
[1:29:09] place
[1:29:10] at this time in this body of believers
[1:29:12] so we confer upon him all of the
[1:29:14] blessings lord that you can confer upon
[1:29:16] him that your word holds
[1:29:17] we pray that you give him wisdom lord
[1:29:18] that he can administer the office
[1:29:20] and give him a heart to the people lord
[1:29:22] that him and his wife can
[1:29:24] serve the people of god that you would
[1:29:26] anoint him with
[1:29:27] understanding with a sensitivity far
[1:29:29] beyond what he's had before
[1:29:30] with spiritual discernment with the
[1:29:32] knowledge to handle every situation that
[1:29:34] he would face
[1:29:35] and god we just pray that you would use
[1:29:36] him to administer to the needs of this
[1:29:38] assembly
[1:29:39] god we also ask that you would hedge him
[1:29:41] about and protect him and his wife and
[1:29:42] his children lord
[1:29:43] from all the fiery darts of the enemy no
[1:29:46] doubt he would love to
[1:29:47] cause confusion and doubt and fear to
[1:29:49] come in but we just pray that you'd be a
[1:29:50] shield and a buckler to our brother
[1:29:52] to his family that you would undergird
[1:29:54] him and protect him and that you would
[1:29:55] hold him in the palm of your hand
[1:29:57] and that you would shield him from all
[1:29:58] the fiery darts of the enemy
[1:30:00] and god we just pray for the whole
[1:30:02] assembly now we just bind our hearts
[1:30:03] together
[1:30:04] and pray that we all minister our place
[1:30:06] in the body and we all
[1:30:08] come up a little higher lord and we all
[1:30:10] press towards the mark of the high
[1:30:11] calling in christ

[1:30:39] long ago

[1:30:42] defer everything up
[1:30:44] right there's a conflict if there's a
[1:30:46] problem there's a question just defer
[1:30:47] okay

[1:31:18] position their post of duty
[1:31:20] and are not passing it up they say this
[1:31:22] is mine this is my responsibility i'll
[1:31:24] take it
[1:31:25] whether it's teaching sunday school
[1:31:26] whether it's visiting shut-ins whether
[1:31:28] it's preparing meals for people or
[1:31:29] trustees or deacons or ministers or
[1:31:31] whatever it is but they're saying
[1:31:33] i'm not going to wait for somebody else
[1:31:34] to do it i'm not going to pass it up
[1:31:36] it's my time
[1:31:37] to take responsibility in the body so i
