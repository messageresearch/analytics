Gabe comes this morning let's sing that E flat I have the preeminence oh precious Lord Strip Me ofing glory and pride please take away all that's left of sin oh precious Lord every make me humble oh I pray and oh precious Lord dri me up glory and pride please take away all that's last of s oh precious Lord every Ence make me humble Lord I pray oh precious Lord Strip Me of glory and pride all that's left of s oh precious Lord every Ence made me [Music] humble pray amen and it's uh it's my prayer this morning preeminence um may seem like a big word but it's really pretty simple and it just means first place and the Lord can just have first place in our lives and I I think if um that word word became um more of the centerpiece of our heart I believe uh we'd see more Supernatural in our lives we'd see less heartaches see less pain suffering and but I think that's why we come to the house of God this morning so that we can dial to ourselves a little bit more and today is the day today is the day and I I want to die early and maybe I can die a little bit more this afternoon and so um I um just appreciate the Lord and thankful to be a Christian appreciate uh every one of you coming out to the house of the Lord and trust that uh something can be said this morning to help you on your Christian Journey that's certainly um the only reason why I'm here this morning is for that purpose and um in order for that to happen I got to be able to surrender myself I um I know uh brother Chad ain't here but uh I was uh I was hearing his voice in my head this morning he was just saying relax just relax he always tells the preachers that relax he's about 14 hours away but I can hear him that just relax we just uh just going to relax this morning uh I do send greetings from Brother Chad yeah I was thinking about um our pastor you know man's 14 hours away and constantly reaching out and I'm praying for you praying for the service and I thought man that's that's that's a real Pastor you know I don't I don't know where he's at in his uh services and you know what time of the hour it is I know it's a 14-hour difference but I'm sure uh for him to try that be Focus for the the churches there but it just shows that his heart is in life and so I just I love appreciate brother Chad and also um brother Manuel um he is away um he's actually preaching in uh um California this morning um I forget the the town slips my mind um but he he said that he'd be streaming or maybe catching a service cuz they're 3 hours ahead so definitely want to uh remember brother Emanuel um just a prince of a man and so we trust that uh God would bless um uh his efforts and then bring him back uh safely uh home to us and then uh and then I think uh he's going to be uh behind the pulpit uh Wednesday again so looking forward to that and so trust that um God will bless him and refresh him um so if we could I I would like to uh read out of the Book of Joel and uh just got uh some slides I'd like to share with you trust by the help of the Lord he would uh be my helper uh this morning and um appreciate uh the Lord Jesus and um I'd like to read uh out of the Book of Joel uh first chapter um and Joel um let's see how do we do here well from the beginning here we go and um Joel chapter one um the word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of pul hear this oh ye old men and give ear uh all ye inhabitants of the land hath been this this beath been ha this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers tell ye your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation that which the Palmer worm hath left hath the Locust eaten and that which the Locust hath left hath a cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten and then if we could go to the second chapter in the 25th verse it says and I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and uh I'd like to speak to you this morning uh by the help of the Lord on uh the heartache of a veteran let's just bow our heads precious Lord just grateful for the honor and privilege it is to be in the house of God this morning and thankful Lord for my brothers and sisters of light precious Faith gathered Lord under the banner of your word Lord in a a dark hour but so grateful that we have light in our dwellings and so as we gather around your word I pray Lord that you would have the preeminence and that you would have first place in every heart you'd have first place behind this pull pit Lord and that what would be said this morning would be a help to each one Lord I I just want to yield to you is all I know how surrender to you and ask that you would help me to speak your word and your word alone God I I pray that the great Holy Spirit would bind my mouth if I wouldn't say something in an offence or out of your word Lord give me courage to speak whatever you had once spoken I I will certainly be a fool for you this morning we commit this service into your hand and each one Lord asking blessings upon brother Chad brother Emmanuel brother Emmanuel ministering soon and I I don't know brother Chad is done or on his way I know he's coming coming close to the end and so wherever he is at in this journey we're just asking a refreshing Lord of your spirit and your hand of mercy of traveling be upon him and we just pray that you watch over him and his children as well Lord we commit all we are into your hands we love you we praise you and we ask these things to be so in the name that's above every name our Lord and savior Jesus Christ amen God bless you can be seated if you like and uh a um thinking of um uh um a veteran um and no doubt as we read in Joel that um there was this great Army that was um um coming against and um we all know as Believers that we're all in a battle and um you know um uh before I get too far into it I I certainly want to um give a little Rose Bud to the veterans of old I I don't know how many uh old veterans do we got here in the house of God anybody yes praise the Lord and so I appreciate uh each uh sacrifice that has been given and so thinking of veterans we certainly want to uh acknowledge the sacrifices that they have given and uh certainly love and appreciate you and that's why we get to enjoy the freedoms that we share this morning how many appreciate that am and so um we uh are grateful this morning for um those ones that were on the battlefield but uh today and this morning we're going to look at um a different Battlefield and so uh we whether we want to or not we're all uh in a battle we're all in a fight and uh as the Bible tells us uh um we are not just to be soldiers but we supposed to be good soldiers and uh to do in hardness as a good soldier that's what God has called us for he's chosen us to be one of those good soldiers and uh no doubt uh it it can be a struggle at times to fight the good fight of Faith um you know it's not a um a easy Road and uh in this battle for restoration um God told us that he would ReStore in this last day and um we uh lot of times uh we we want to see a true restoration of God's word is that right and um but in this modern day that we live in a lot of times uh it's not restoration but it's uh uh um uh Improvement right that's that's that's uh kind of the ladyo see and age they they they take a classic and they want to modernize it they want to improve on it and and and we we see that same thing reflected uh spiritually uh in the house of God that that that's what we all fight against and uh no matter uh we may not say well brother Gabe I like the you know I like the 60s but but you know whenever it's time for restoration uh we like putting our little touches on it oh come on now right we we we got we got something in our in our our favorite vehicle and what we love and but you know we we we just want to do a little tweak here and and and just a little tweak there and and uh unfortunately uh we all have that when it comes to the the Christian experience thank you uh those of you that said amen the rest of you before you say am man you need to repent cuz I I'm not preaching to Angels this morning we we we all uh want to uh do a little tweak here and we know uh because we like it our way is that right but but God has called us to take what has been corrupted and to have a true restoration that it goes back to the original right we don't want to adding not one thing to it we we don't even want to put the fuzzy dice on the mirror right we want it original amen just like it came from the factory and and you know we we we we think of this and and in this message there there's so many uh offshoots and so many uh ideas and and and there's so many different fandangled things but I I love what the prophet said uh in a a man running from the presence of the Lord he he he took the Mysteries and he made it so real brother bam says he says in uh man running from the presence of the Lord he says now watch what he says may all the great Mysteries that we are supposed to know at this age Lord be unveiled to us amen and we'll see the plainness of God Amen so so the revelations ought to make what yeah Christ plain to us so so if we have a revelation of complication that's not the Mysteries but but the revelations ought to bring plainness of Christ amen but but watch what he says he says so that we'll know what's the mystery supposed to do so that we'll know how to behave ourselves sir an act correcting ourselves and bringing the members of our body into discipline to the word that we might know how to live in this present day at the approaching of the Lord Jesus so in this message in this seven seal book of redemption that's been Loos to us in this day yes it ought to bring plainness and it ought to bring us to a realization of the incorrect parts of our body and it ought to bring our members of our body into discipline to God's word amen and and if that message brings anything else we're looking at it wrong you know we we all want the Mysteries but but really in essence we ought to look and say what are the Mysteries doing for me where am I at in my Christian experience and and and and if it's and and and if we're falling short then then maybe we need to real maybe we need to take a second look and go wait a minute maybe I don't see the Mysteries like I should you know because in this in this hour there's there's so much um uh so many offshoots right and and and in this movement we're we're we're more broken up uh and there's so many uh ideas and and my you know if there was 900 denominations uh in the prophets day well how many do we have amongst our own ranks right but but but we only have one message and we only have one Bible and and so it those those seals that have been revealed it ought to show us the plainness of God Amen so so if the Mysteries being anything else than the plainness of God yes it that means it ought to be Clarity yeah amen right and and and if it and if if it doesn't bring Clarity then something's wrong with us yes brother Bram tells us he says in the first seal he says here's the plan of it the first thing that happens there is an announcement in the heavens first what happens a seal is open what is that a mystery is unfolded see and when a mystery unfolds then a trumpet sounds it declares a war or a plague Falls and the church age open see what is the war part now watch cuz remember we're talking about what the heartache of a veteran he says what is the war part the angel of the church catches the mystery of God not fully yet revealed but when he does he catches this mystery of God and then he goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given given to him now why is it that some people say the mystery ain't been given right he says Goes Forth to the people what does he do do out there he begins to Proclaim that message and what does it start a war yes a spiritual war and all of us this morning are in the midst of that spiritual war young and old alike we we come and we have our Sunday Best and there's no camouflage there's no combat boots right that there's no there's no AR-15s in the house of God I I don't think uh right and and and but yet yet we are all sitting here in a spiritual battle because we know how many believes that the seals have been revealed right and so and so that declares to us a war and all of us whether we want to be or not we have to realize that we're veterans on the battlefield and some of us have been on the battlefield longer than others but those that are seasoned veterans those are the ones we ought to look to yeah the Saints of gods that that that have that have that have been you know you know the thing of it is is you you look at some people some people uh they love to fight you know and and you think about it in in in in in just our human ability we are naturally prone to lean one way or the another we're either in flight mode or we're in fight mode yeah right when there's any type of a confrontation or or any type of a of a struggle or something happens that adrenaline gets to pumping and what happens you got well they also say you get in Frozen [Laughter] mode right right you you now one of one of the other you are going to be prone to uh whether whether you whether you want to or not because we we all we all have one of the other right where when something happens something inside of you you have no control of it it's an unconscious thing that unfortunately my nature my makeup I ain't got no flight in me my flight is sitting over there in the fifth row the third seat over see we was we was on we were coming to church this morning and my little one say sh I want to sit on the end and and wifey goes no I want to I don't want to sit on the end see cuz she don't want nothing part of that outside Road she she she she wants to be hidden and protected and hid away right but but I I don't know some of us we we ain't got no flight in us and you know that sometimes there it's really not a good thing to have I I just I just be honest with you I struggle with it cuz you know I'm I'm pretty laid back what you laughing what you mean what you mean brother look at look you see what I see I said you look see automatically like hold fast what you mean brother I'm pretty laid back brother John Amen brother but but there's something on the inside of me that that the moment I see some type of Injustice or something that's wrong I I I am automatically fight right there just something in me where I'm just I'm a protector when it when it when it comes to uh I don't care who anybody that that I love or somebody that loves me brother I go to the ends of the world for you don't matter seek a swim let's go but but that's not always the right way but there can also be the opposite of that to where you are always flight that any time there's a situation that arises you're gone in the wind right and listen you have to be honest with yourself and go you know what that's not healthy either oh yeah because you can't run your whole life you say well that's just my nature but remember we want the nature of Christ to have preeminence in our lives and so it can't just be fight and it can't just be flight but but there there has to be a balance in it all that we can be honest with ourselves hello and look into the mirror of God's word and say God I need your leadership in every aspect of my life life that's why we have to be surrendered and yielded because I don't know about you but but suffer yourself to be defrauded oh excuse me right oh my that's that's a rough scripture for me right cuz you taking something that's mine what you mean but the Bible tells us the Lord Jesus tells us that when your enemy take something from you what you supposed to do you supposed to peel off the coat too right but but you know you know sometimes we we we can we can be in in such a passive mode to where we end up always trying to advert the battles and that's not right either because because if you're constantly pushing things off I don't want to you know you know here's the here's the thing here's the problem we we we in life we um watch what brother brah says brother BR says now let let them soak down into that church that copper WI that's a conductor now aluminum wire isn't a conductor see it is it isn't a rubber hose isn't a conductor it's a insulator wood an insulator we don't want any insulations we got too much of it now and it makes isolations so let's let's let's let's let's let's pretend this is BCF right oh my and you know sometimes listen you know you know the thing of it is is ain't you glad you you you you you start getting free of the cares of this world and man you start you you you got integrity and you got work ethic and man so you know what you just start climbing the corporate ladder yes sir I mean I mean nowadays you just show up and pass a drug test you you're you're in management position you know you understand what I'm saying right I mean hey but that's management material yeah you got to pause praise the Lord right and and so and so what what do we naturally become when we go to work every day Faithfully right no hangover on Monday and no no no uh always gone Friday and you know starting a party early and but he's faithful he works over he comes in early he no no back talk does what what he say what what what you tell him to do and right and and and and so and so we if if if you want to succeed in life being a Christian it's it's impossible for you to fail if you're failing in life you're doing something wrong because naturally unless you just God's got you there because you he's trying to get you to grow something but you understand what I'm saying but but the thing of it is is we can start we can can get a few years down the road from life and and and maybe that old life that we once had and we can we we can we can get a a a a home and and and we can you know get a wife and children and everything's going good we we pay our tithe amen and an offering and and we ain't looking to cut corners and you know play paying on the on the growth on the net but we paying on on the is that right paying on the I always get them two maxed up whatever one cost you the most you pay that one right you ain't looking for a way out and and and and you're faithful in tithes and faithful in offering and and and and and you know missionaries and always wanting to help in the house of God and giving up your time and all those different things and naturally you're going to be blessed yes right you you good to your children and you got family devotions and all these different things and always faithful in the house of God and but but the thing of it is is if we ain't careful we so we slowly start getting off the battlefield because we get insulated we live within our means we Don't Rock the Boat you know why cuz cuz we're comfortable but again because we don't want to be at War we want to be Rock AB live within your means and and and we we get our little we get our little F favorite group we got a handful of brothers and sisters we fellowship with we all get along we all like the same things right [Music] goodbye and then last year brother Gabe comes [Music] Rocka hey I'm coming up on we coming up on a year oh it's been so good I'm so thankful I love y'all I really do I so I'm so appreciate this church but you know here's we can get insulated and we got our little group our little niche right we got our little bill cycle week to week service to service and when we see that coworker we don't like we go the other way flight we we know that their routine so when they're here we're there we got it mapped out cuz we don't want no [Music] problems you you know what I realized in life I realize that the people that's in our lives that caus US problems are there for a purpose because if we just insulate ourselves with men how will we ever grow you remember what brother brandom said when he said when they had that tax case and he and they said well you just got a bunch of Puppets on your on your board trust him he said listen if I had a puppet I'd throw him off amen right he said if that man had a diff a different idea I got him there for that purpose cuz cuz even that Prophet didn't want yes men around him yeah but the thing of it is it's easy for us as human beings because we don't want confrontation and so what do we do we insulate ourselves and insulations creates isolations and that is not healthy what I found is the the people that rub me the wrongest those are the ones that I want around me and those that are coming to the house afterward please you are not the one brother Les looking at me like oh yeah brother hey yesterday brother Aaron he was working on my shoulder ain't you so glad there's so so many gifts in the body but Aaron is so next time he'll be like but but what I want what I'm trying to get you to understand is those people that rub you the wrong way are there for a purpose because if you do not have them there how are you going to see the flaws in your life how are you going to see the character flaws in your makeup those people are there for a purpose cuz they're there to expose them and so and so when when when I when you know when when I see those people and and whether it's on the job or uh I don't have any here please y'all are [Laughter] angels but what we need to do what we need to pull back the isolation the insulation because because remember you are the salt of the earth but that salt does no good in a salt shaker you can look at it see it looks nice nice white but but what ha that that that salt has to make contact and and if and if we are the salt of the earth then we must make contact that means we have to get out of our comfort zone and it's so easy for us to become so isolated and insulated that we lose our savior what that salt is is something that preserves if you take meat and you you back in the day way back before they had you know the frigidaires what did they do that salt they used that salt because it preserved and and if and and we want to put Jesus as the savior of the world but really you are that's am but the only way you can express that attribute of Savior is if you get out on the front line amen where we don't want to go we don't want to get hurt that's why we insulate ourselves that's why we isolate ourselves you know or or you or if if if you are a fighter by Nature then this message buddy you got all kind of ammunition you know you know i' I've seen I i' I've seen I've seen you know Brethren uh take this message and want to argue and fight and you know and and you you you how many y'all know what I'm talking about maybe some of you was that way right and but you know I got to thinking about it you know we can take this message and we can go around and we can go around killing people you know I I'm I'm going have to use I'm going have to use uh uh brother uh brother Benjamin's uh uh disclaimer this this is just me I I I haven't found a quote on it but you know I got to thinking if um let's say let's say there's somebody and they they just somebody that was good to the bride and they never are going to understand this message I wonder how many message Believers ran through the factory just wanting to fet everybody yeah amen right oh yeah I've seen it and you think you know I I'm not talking about looking for an excuse not to witness but but sometimes people just want to shove it down yeah amen right but but I wonder if we ought to be more prayerful about it right just like brother brandham said when brother Bram said he said he'd he'd go up to somebody and he'd talk to him for a little bit and what would what he do he'd fill him out he didn't just jump up and rip open Malachi 4 and goes that's me repent and perish no right amen but but what did he do he he he would he would he would sit with him talk with him and talk about fishing and you know and then all of a sudden slip in a little something about the Lord and then he'd wait that's right right then then if that and then what's he doing he'd be fishing and if that if that fish would nibble a little bit he he'd maybe wait a little bit and then he'd say a little something else I I wonder if we would take that approach how much more effective would our testimony be but but if we just go looking at somebody because they ain't like us but but what if what if what if they ain't like us because there's something deeper yes you a lot of times you know because we we we are uh we have the understanding that we have a lot of times we we we do a lot of damage you know we see somebody that's in I I I got that I hope you understand I I want you just to see the the iceberg of it because a lot of times we'll look at people and we'll just see the ice and we'll see what we see but we don't realize what's underneath the surface of that person right you know I was uh uh talking to brother Aaron uh uh yesterday and he he he was he he was working on my my my you know I've had been having some back problems and shoulder and neck and just been horrible and uh you know uh the older I get the more I realize the more sympathetic I am to the older ones yeah yeah let sister Virginia she laughing right you know because when we're young we just throw something off it ain't no big deal and we look at somebody hobbling along got to pain and they all how mean all Shake it off but you know sometimes there's things you can't shake off it's what you don't see and and if you ain't ever walked down that road of chronic pain you have no idea what that person goes through it may be everything that they can do just to keep a straight face when they walk and because they didn't smile at you somehow in your mind your imitation discernment wants to lay out the whole plan of cuz we got the message and right uh how many ever had the artificial discernment thank look old veteran back there brother B look old s first one hand up now the rest of y'all need to repent because why because we're under the influence of that eagle all of a sudden we always got eiz and we want we but let me ask you did you have a vision did that person come on your right side did did you grab a hand did you ain't got a scripture in there nothing but all of a sudden you want to explain the whole life and the situation when you you are only seeing the tip yeah amen of that Iceberg you you look at you look at God God has such a way you think about think about this when we look we like to judge one ver one person for what they are and what they done and what happened but we fail to realize that God don't just look at J Z he sees what that baby boomer did 50 years ago right and we we in our human Minds we all of a sudden on the battlefield we want to process and dissect and putting but if you if you really think about it we wonder why somebody gets away with what they get away with and you don't but you don't understand that person is laboring under something that they ain't even guilty of it was something great granddaddy did it's a family strain that's been haunting that lineage for Generations ations and we wonder why and you ain't got a clue I I talk brother brother Aaron he said he he he he told me he said yeah brother he said you got this problem here in your back and he said uh he he he he said it was uh I'm going to get all technical on you here watch this he said uh he said it was uh he said yeah brother he said it's your uh sympatic uh nervous sitting with the parasitic symic nervous system and you notice how I said that real fast like I knew how and so he was telling me that that you you you have a your Paras syic nervous system is your rest and digest response but your simp symp sympathetic nervous system is your flight or flight response and and and they were explaining that that's your Yin and your yang but but you can have something in your back that that is attacking that nervous you can have a trauma in your nervous system that always keeps you in flight or flight mode and your body doesn't get a chance to rest because of that trauma in your body and that person just wants rest but because of trauma that has happened deep down inside that that person has no control of it keeps him in that flight or fight mode and it's crying for rest and rest is evaded and that person don't want you to judge him what that person wants you to do is put a strong hand of faith and start working on that trauma oh it it's not easy but if we can work on that trauma then we can get that deep down inside something at rest so that it's not always in flight or flight mode amen right you you you you say brother Gabe what look you you you you think about this let let me let me just show you uh wh watch watch what I I found it says here it says the the parasynthetic nervous system is famous for controlling the rest and digest functions of the body the Paras sythetic nervous system is the yin to the sympathetic sympathetic nervous system Yang and work in tandem with each other when a stress occurs a sympathetic reaction allows our body to respond after the bodies have accomplished the task the parasitic uh uh must bring the body back down to normal or to a state of hematosis watch it says the disconnect occurs because the parasynthetic nervous system is essentially turned off which means they are in Flight fight or flight constantly this is what leads to a lot of elevated behaviors and they were talking about uh children how they can be in this they can have this trauma and and it puts them in this elevated and and and and in this get them you know ADHD and all these different things that that attack them but but if but if they can uh uh diagnosed this this nervous disorder it can put him at rest now um I I was I was thinking about this and uh be before brother Aaron came you know I was looking at this fight ORF flight uh response and and I asked the Lord uh Lord where is it scripturally and and and uh and and then I wanted to quote on it and I uh um scripturally it's actually in Philippians um Philippians 4:6 it says be careful and that means anxious careful means anxious so if I could say be anxious or careful for nothing but in in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus and it was so beautiful I I love God's word when when you look at just that one word it is explodes of keep it means to keep with the Garrison to guard Protect by military guard either to prevent hostile Invasion fight or to keep the inhabitants of the besieged city from flight oh my you know here's the thing listen I'll just be honest with you I ain't smart enough to search the Bible and finding stuff friends I but but but God is so faithful that if if you'll just pray and ask you know God will will direct your footsteps into his word and it just it just so blessed me that that that God would show it that that if the peace of God which passes all understanding that is what's going to keep you it's going to keep you at rest so that you're not in fight mode and that you're not in flight mode but you can be at rest because really isn't that how we're supposed to fight the battle isn't that how a real Soldier fights you know you know I I I I was I was uh I was uh after the Lord showed me that scripture it was Saturday more or Friday night and I asked the Lord I was like Lord I said I where's the quote at I I want to I want a quote Lord I I I I I want to understand and you know I I took a quote that that I had already seen and I put it in in in here and then uh I was looking at it and then brother Aaron came over and he started talking about those two nervous systems and when he started talking to him I I I said oh brother I said preach brother keep preaching what I said keep preaching brother he's over there cranking I oh but but watch what brother brandom says this is so beautiful he says now how many knows brother Ben on on the tapes you know the loud one front row always laughing cutting up right that's brother Ben I love brother Ben watch he says Ben he said I ought to work on you bless you thank you brother Ben I love you I love you brother Ben if you know what that boy suffered for us in the war he shot all the pieces and blowed up and everything else he had a life of everything I want you to notice I did I I had this quote already in my my my my notes and then and then brother Aaron comes a few hours afterwards it's just it it may not mean nothing to you but it blesses me he says he says he's all shot to pieces and blowed up and everything he's had a life of everything but God blessed him and stayed true his wife left him run away married again took his children oh my I just can't think about it but anyhow God bless you Ben he's laying right now full of shrapnel pressing against his nerves and everything else watch what he said brother bam says which you have to know the background of things you see God bless that boy see somebody could look at brother Ben just loud mouth you know he ain't respectful he ain't what's he doing always laughing cutting up that's the prophet of God but brother brandham says you're not looking at it right right he he he's he's he's been on the battlefield and he suffered some trauma in his life and them wounds in his life is pressing his nerves it's always keeping him in fight or flight and the brother brandham says you have to know the background yes and friends what I'm what I'm trying to encourage you when you're on the battlefield maybe you ought to take time to know the background let let let's put our artificial discernment in our back pocket and let's sit across the table and you open your heart yes and then as the prophet of God taught us let that person open their heart am and that's what True Fellowship is and then we'll begin to understand the background then we'll begin to understand why they are the way that they are yes because a lot of times we just remember we are not called to judge on outward appearance but we're called to judge with righteous judgment and that means we have to take away all of our preconceived you know you know you know we as human beings we look at somebody instantly and we have a judgment on them that's just that's just human nature we we can see somebody in their face and we'll automatically subconsciously have them figured out and you know that person you're looking at is may not and you and you may automatically not like them because the way that they look and they ain't done nothing to you and you know the reason why you don't like them it's because they look like somebody that hurt you in your past that's just human nature friends that that's you you can Google it it'll I mean it ain't no deep Revelation that's just human nature and that's what we all fight against because uh somebody uh got a nose like somebody that hurts you and the moment you see that nose all of a sudden you're really to make it bigger right and now person ain't done nothing to you but it's because you had trauma in your past you you look at the [Music] um you you look at the um Good Samaritan is this okay 12:00 when you read about the Good Samaritan you know whenever he was when those wounds that he had uh you know he was going from Jerusalem to Jericho and brother brandham said that that he that that types a backsliding Believer right and he fell Amongst Thieves and he was wounded but if you look at that I love that wo look at the word wounded the wounds the the Greek word is actually trauma but I love the Perfection of God's word that he would so put words in there because this story is more than just a man that helped a man that was beat up on a side of a road because brother brandham takes that and he says that uh uh the man was left for half dead that means he was uh a backsliding condition and and that the Good Samaritan came and and uh poured in the oil and the wine right we know what the oil and wine represents and put him on his Beast right that eagled anointing you can see the types and took him to the end which is the house of God and gave him two pence see uh spirit and truth I mean you know just on on and on all the types and shadows of it but what I want you to what I want you to see is look at the beauty of the word that that simple word trauma the it says from the the base of uh T Rosco it means but watch to wound but it means it's akin to the base of three other words so these wounds are multifaceted so that trauma we can look and just labeled as trauma but it's actually deeper than that because that that those three words actually paint a very deep description of what that person is going through because those three words means to break in pieces shatter Smite through the other part is A Worn Path and the third part of it it means to Nash to squeak make a Str cry to Nash or grind one's teeth ain't that beautiful that that when God would put maybe some own private Revelation I don't know but but and when you look at it those three parts of that word that make up one word shows us that it was broken and a warm path how many's ever nashed their teeth and had a shrill cry when God is saying this man had those kind of wounds what's he telling us it was pain that was more than just a superficial scratch and we as Humanity we go through life and Trauma happens sometimes it's emotional trauma sometimes it's physical trauma sometimes it's psychological trauma right and sometimes it's spiritual trauma all those different elements that come with us when we're on our life's journey and sometimes we get wounded and the priest walks by but he walks on the other side you don't want to get his hands dirty the levite you know what that is that's bride Y and walks on the other side I don't want nothing to do with it flight mode but then there's somebody that's a veteran and when that person that Good Samaritan looks on that wounded soldier there's no scorn yeah there's no disgust yeah amen but it's actually a Heart full of Sorrow amen cuz that veterans been there before see he done took off the insulation and the isolation and he wants to make contact look the thing of it is friends too many times we have the message persona but I wonder if we would really be who we really are yes if we would take off the insulation and the isolation and stop stop trying to be something that we're not listen I want to make heaven and if I got to make myself a fool in front of you that's what I got to do cuz cuz if that if I got that much pride in me then that's what I got to do look I I I do not want to just I don't want to just barely make heaven but I want to come to those doors knowing that I fought a good fight I finished my course I made mistakes but I made them right right amen when when when when we go you know that Good Samaritan he can look at that person he can say yeah I've been there but I'm going to take time and what does he do he binds up the womb but then he pours in the Holy Spirit you can make it and then he pours in the wine which is what stimulation of Revelation ation right and he puts him on his own Beast that means he puts he has a burden for that person you know you know um there there's a there's a um you know when we're talking about old veterans you know you could be on the battlefield one day and technically you're a vet but I don't know if I want to fight beside you I want some old sold wrapped around me when we're on the battlefield I want somebody got some experience right I want somebody that's been down a few roads that's why listen I I love them old them them gray-headed ones them the ones I love I I love it because hey I maybe I can get some I can get some experience off of you may maybe I can learn a little something and bypass a few hardships to life cuz they done been down a few roads I look at brother Bob a old sage right yeah look at it he like oh brother but see that's what I'm talking about see yeah it's somebody look I I brother Bob been on my heart the whole time I've been studying this I can't get him off my heart but he done been down a few roads you see that man got a few heartaches but you know what whenever you whenever you're whenever you're going through a bad time it'll be some it would be one of them old sages that puts his arm around you and he'll hug you just a little bit longer than he normally does but you know why because them old sages done been down a few roads and they watch even when you ain't watching and they'll say a look and they won't have no artificial discernment but they'll know you know you know you know when when in when a in in the life of an eagle I was listening to a a a preacher I don't think he's even a message preacher I think his name was a Bobby Thompson brother Bobby Thompson and he preached on Eagles he loved Eagles study Eagles his whole life and he said that he said that one time he had met this uh Indian and this Indian took him down to somewhere in North Carolina and uh and uh and showed him something that when Eagles go through a moping period of life it's when they go through a state of depression all Eagles go through it he said and he said he said when those Eagles get in that state they stop Flying and they go down into a valley and and their beaks get crusted over and their eyes and they stop eating they don't fly like they used to they just hop around and because they ain't used to walking their feet get all swok up and you know he said he said but there's something that special happens during that time he says there's other eagles that will fly to that Valley and will drop fresh meat down to the ones that are in the valy they'll take out all of the bones and they'll chew that meat up like it would for a baby because their beaks all crusted and they can't eat but that eagle will chew it up and then drop it it won't it won't go down there but it'll drop it hoping that that another Eagle that's in that Valley of depression will pick that meat up and eat it but here's the amazing thing that that Indian told him he said the only Eagles that fly overhead and drop the meat is the old veterans he said the Young Eagles won't do it cuz they've never been down there right right but it's the old vets see old vets has done Ben to few hard roads they done been through a few valleys but they had an old vet dropped some food down to them right and now now they see that it's their time to drop some meat to somebody else I'm preaching to you this morning the heartache of a veteran it's not the seed of the scornful yeah right but it's the heartache of a veteran and if we would look it you know if we would look at the lost souls on the job place but look at them as lost souls on the job place we want to hold them to a message standard when they don't have no clue what a message standard is you don't know what that person been through you don't know the trauma that's affecting their nervous system on why they're always in fight mode well maybe now you know maybe you're the one instead of running the other way when you see them maybe you need to run to them see if we would really if we would really have a feeling one for another like we should if we would get past all the isolations of life if we would get to the place brother Bram says we only have to go through those schools of sufferings to know how the other fell Fields those stages of life but if we would step back a little bit and not not just look at our eyes but look at their shoes and then Step In Those Shoes amen step in your coworker shoes you know that family member that just rubs you the wrong way maybe you're looking at it wrong maybe you need to look a little deeper [Music] um brother bam says this God leads his people through great trials to purge them and sometime it takes years to do it what and ask for myself tonight I believe that right now God is training such men to meet the front line men who are going to go through the time shook from their feet sometimes look like the whole thing's falling but yet in the midst of it all they know that the Living God they know that Living God and keep their face forward keep moving on years to purge yes some of y'all looking at me like brother Gabe turn that off before I break that camera dope years to purge him and we see that right there y'all know what I'm talking about look you see it changing right that's why Facebook look you think about what it three 2 three four 5 minute it can't go more than 3 minute videos because why got children watching I saw something watching about cartoons and they do like the they change the scene I can't remember how many seconds and just constantly and it's making everybody right microwave fast fast f we ain't got time and and the thing of it is what we do what we some like brother Gabe I'm telling you I'm going to go up there and grab that clicker you here there you go but what it is it patience they that wait upon the Lord yes but we live in this nervous neurotic age and we're so caught up in our you know we're so caught up in our own lives we're so insulated we don't want to be on the battlefield and we do everything that we can in life to stay off of the battlefield and then we wonder why things just unexpectedly happen and then we get so frustrated because we've tried so hard to stay off of the battlefield but friends we are not called to get saved filled with the Holy Ghost and then retire that's what we want right we want the white picket fence we want the house we want the three and a half children we want the dog name Fritz and uh right and we want everything paid for we don't want no problems we want no stress everybody we don't want no problems but friends no no M look the the the problem of it is we spend so many times outwardly and the problem is here no matter how well we get the bank account the job and all those different things and we can look at everybody else say this person got a problem that person this I'm stay away from him they got problem no you are the one that has the problem amen you are the one I am the one we are the ones and if we would spend less time trying to stay off of the battlefield and spend more time on the battlefield fighting with our Brethren what can I do for you amen what can I do brother you all right ain't seen you for a while just you you're doing okay you know I love you brother phone call text something that's what we do to fight it's encouragement this world is discouraging young people all the pressure that you're under oh my right it ain't easy but I I I I hope I hope I hope you understand that there's a process that we go through to get from there to there and it takes time there and I'm I'm closing but I just want to hit a few things there there's a process that we have to go through there is a process you know that sword Naturally Fit that man's hand perfectly but it would have fit in 33 but not perfectly and forgive me for I'm that's not I don't know I just tried my best to do the king sword get the little children a little illustration he said it was pearl handle with the G over and right silver but but the thing of it is it took that man 30 years it took that man 30 years to come to a spot it took three phases of his ministry for him to grow to that position look naturally that sword fit his hand when he was a full grown man at 1933 when he is on the why didn't the king sword come then that's right cuz there was he had to come to where it fit his hand perfectly brother brandham had to have character so that he could wield that sword amen the right way and we listen friends there's only one sword and that's his word but I wonder how do we wield it how do we handle it do we have that peace that passes all understanding because if we don't have that peace we should never get on the battlefield because if we fight without that peace we are going to cause nothing but problems but when we can have that peace on the inside of us then that gives us the ability to be on the battlefield oh my I um I'm going to end with this I I uh oh man wow oh there's just not enough time um and we're going to close with this this is a very familiar scripture I'm sure no doubt most of us could probably quote it a man that hath friends must show himself friendly and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother but I want you to think about what your definition of friendly is and then I want you to see God's definition of it it's to be bad be evil be displeasing to be sad to be injurious be evil be Wicked to suffer hurt injury to do an injury hurt to do evil wickly mischief to break shattered to break broken to be broken broken in pieces be broken aund so if we really want to be friendly with each other what are we supposed to be broken shattered you know what that is that's being honest that's true friendship if you're really friendly with me you'll confide in me and go brother I just got this and that and we'll sit across the table friendly is not like we we think happy joke no no no no no he that hath friends must show himself broken just pleased you think wait a minute that that's totally that was your concept of friendly that was your Javelin with 22s on it right modified and but God's idea is the original just like it come from the factory M and what does that tell us friends if we want to be if we really how many wants to have friends right he that then what are we supposed to do we are supposed to say brother I'm just as broken as you are I'm just as sinful as you are brother but it's the grace of God that we are where we are amen I was just as shattered I was just as filthy I was just as undone look these young right what what are we supposed to do we're supposed to be friendly to him and say hey I've been there done that yeah it took me a while to overcome it too but you know what God was faithful and God will be faithful to you too that's a friend that sticketh closer than a brother a brother you don't have no choice in but it's when we're friends we choose amen and we ought to choose our friends wisely and we ought to realize if our true friends are true friends then we'll be friendly one to another and that means we'll let down every guard every facade go brother I'm broken you pray for me I'm struggling in this got this problem and can and then what what do you say well brother hey Hey listen let's let's fast over it let's miss a few meals let's consecrate ourselves to the Lord and pray God said that he would break our them yolks if we would fast and that's what the Bible says but the thing of it is is if we're going to be on the battlefield it's going to require sacrifice can we stand you know maybe you play something softly sometimes in life you know we look at John and we know John's the type of the Bride but John had a lot of fight in him the sons of Thunders him and him and James bu hey they had that Spirit of Elijah on them they ready call fire out of heaven cuz somebody wouldn't feed him right but but you know it wasn't it wasn't much longer afterwards that God began to break that man down you know when he went to that aisle of patmas things changed for him brother brandom said it took him two years two years you read that book of Revelation it surely don't take you two years two years but God has some purging to do on that man you say brother Gabe he already had the Holy Ghost I'm just telling you what the prophet [Music] said so I'm not saying you ain't got the Holy Ghost but maybe God's got you on the aisle of patment too cuz there's some pers need to be done to you but there's some pers need to be done to me I ain't in the seat of the scornful but what I'm saying is when when John got that Revelation you know what it did it didn't puff him up but it brought him low brother brother bham says brother bham says after he returned from the aisle of patmas only thing he could say was little children love one another he didn't hint about the seventh seal and but he found there was something real and that was the disciple that wanted to call fire down on the city and burn him up cuz they wouldn't give him nothing to eat something changed in that man that when he was on that a of patmas that two years probably broke him a little bit you imagine seeing a vision and wait 6 Months 8 months I wonder how often it was them Visions happen couldn't have been too often 8 n months span maybe got all of them the last one took him two years who knows what it was but man day after day hour after hour but God was M than a character in that man cuz whenever he had the opportunity where he could say what he wanted to say he had the character from that two-year Journey where he kept his mouth and sometimes we go through trials maybe takes years to do it but there's people in the Bible that we can look to you think Joseph when him Brothers threw him in the in in the pit I think the Bible said he was like 17 years old you know it wasn't until he was 30 till he was at the right hand of pharaoh that man went through 13 years of Agony and pain [Music] but what did it do it broke him down and mowed him and purged him gave him a character that when his brother's lives was in his hands he said don't cry God done it it was to preserve life and I'm telling you friends if if those veterans y'all know what I'm talking about cuz it's when we've been on the road and we've had some rough there's roads we've been down we shouldn't have went down a second time and we did did caused a lot of heartache and pain but when we go down the second time it sometimes it does something to you it gives you [Music] grit it gives you that heartache in that in that feeling that when you see others go down you say oh please don't go down that oh but when you see them go down that road you're waiting right there here cuz you know some point they got to come right back here and you go I'm going to wait for them cuz somebody waited for me see if we would enter into that kind of travail one for another if we would have that kind of feeling one for the other and when we go through those schools of suffering it's for a purpose it's to mold us and make us but it's also so that we can have the same heartfelt feeling that we can drop down a little handful of meat to that young soldier in the [Music] valley the heartache that we have and that we feel is for a purpose don't look at your life and say it was all it's vain there's no purpose why' I have to go through that look you're looking at it wrong let's bow our [Music] heads precious Lord truly Lord we're so thankful for your hand of faith upon Our [Music] Lives Lord uh heartaches of life or are many but Lord we we want to be found faithful on that [Music] day Lord when we're on the battlefield of Life please give us wisdom to fight the good fight of [Music] faith help us to walk walk in peace that passes all understanding when the wars of Life are [Music] raging help us to see you say to the storms peace be still Lord give us Faith to say those same words words that we can call those things that are not as though they [Music] were Lord that we'd have a heart of compassion for the lost souls in this world we'd have an outst stretched hand of grace and [Music] mercy [Music] Lord that we would have that same lamb nature that John had and he could take the book something happened Lord from him wanting to call fire out of Heaven to that aisle of patmas when he took the book Lord I I pray that we each one could have that same lamb nature tenderness sacrificial meekness Lord that it wouldn't be fight or flight but just [Music] surrender I pray Lord each one here you know the Cry of the heart I don't but I pray Lord that you would Minister to the needs your great Holy Spirit would have the Liberty to walk the house men broken hearts set capus free Lord we just commit ourselves into your hands ask your blessings upon what's been spoken take what's wrong and make it right for your glory is our prayer we commit all we are into your hands we ask these things to be so in the mighty name of our Savior Jesus [Music] Christ amen God bless you brothers sisters I anyone
