like Moses on the back side of the desert no matter how well he was educated whatever whatever had taken place his fears and frustrations left because he stood on a sacred ground with God that nobody could take it away from him and every man or woman that has an experience with God has met this same Pillar of Fire upon the sacred grounds of your heart there is no Theologian no devil no nothing Paul said nothing present nothing futured in death sickness sorrow can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus it's a typos you know something happened no matter how much science raised up raises this that or the other you are tied you and God become one he's in you and you're in him why because through this message he's given a voice in this day and that voice is the voice of God just like at Mount Sinai and we've got an option we can run away from that voice or we can run to that voice and stand before God face to face you know the Apostle Paul was struck down by a light and that light had a voice behind it and that voice was Jesus Christ and he says who are you Lord amen you know he went back into the form of Pillar of Fire which he was before amen and he says I'm G I'm Jesus whom you persecute but you know there was other men with Paul and those other men did not clearly understand what the voice said they heard something but they didn't hear a voice and then they heard something but they saw no man they saw a light but then they didn't hear there's several different reports in the Bible what does it show it looks like a confusion maybe the story doesn't match what it shows amen is no matter how loud The Voice rings out only the elect will hear the voice and meet God face to face they were all there when the light shine but only Paul's the one who met Jesus Christ they were there when Jesus was declaring himself in a pillar of fire they were there when he was thundering out the word but only the elect predestinated met God face to face how many people said in brother Bennett's meetings and how many heard the word priest and how many were there for the seals but only a few met God face to face how many listened to the tapes how many have read the books how many said in a message how many hear the anointed preaching of the word but how many meet God face to face because we've got to go beyond the image before our eyes and go past that and who's behind the animate who's past the veil who's beyond all of that it's God back there declaring himself showing that I am present you can meet me face to face not a book not a tape not a Creed not a new teaching amen but the person he's declaring himself by a voice and we can meet him face to face you can come to the same service and hear the same exact words and one person will have met God face to face and they would have their lives discerned and their aunt questions answered and Direction and instruction and it'd be almost prophetic and another person will sit there and I got nothing and I saw nothing and that man behind the pulpit and the other person said I didn't even see the man behind the pulpit it was God speaking to me how can how can we walk out of the same service in somebody's miraculously delivered and somebody's all tied up in knots because we've got to look Beyond the Veil and listen for a voice
