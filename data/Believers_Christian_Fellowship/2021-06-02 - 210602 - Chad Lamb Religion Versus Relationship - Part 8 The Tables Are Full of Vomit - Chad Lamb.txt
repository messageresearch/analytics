here together god is good to us is he not amen now that i can see your face is no yawning no smirking no grimace just smile please amen we counted a privilege to be together today it's been a strange year a lot of things have changed one way than the other but but god's kept us through it all amen when we compare notes with those our brothers and sisters around the world we've had it really easy friends we've been blessed god's made it to where we can be together we can fellowship together and whatever inconveniences they had they were very minor but i tell you they were good for my character and i thank god for that i thank god that he's brought us through he's bringing us through no doubt there's many more things we'll face more trials more obstacles more difficulties more tough decisions more more and more and more but he's the one who'll bring us through them all right and he's doing it for our good because he wants to reflect himself in us so we thank god for that while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn to isaiah 28. i'd like to continue on with religion versus relationship this would be part 8. and we'll take this scripture out of isaiah chapter 28. in isaiah 28 and we'll read just one verse we'll read verse eight for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean so i'd like to take that for our text tonight for the title the tables are full of vomit it sounds rough but i pray you'll understand as we expound on that as we get into it let's bow our heads and just ask the lord's blessing lord jesus we thank you for the privilege again father of gathering like this for it's your grace that's brought us here lord you've sustained us and kept us and gathered us together again and oh god how we thank you for your goodness to us and lord i pray that you would come and make yourself known by the breaking of bread god may you feed your sheep and may we be the sheep of your pasture that feeds from your hand and god may we grow by this food that you give us give us the eye salve that we might see more clearly in the day that we're living may we follow after you and be pleasing to you and all we say or do lord have preeminence among us and keep us along the way in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can all be seated we're not going to really expound on this verse right now brother branham does later we'll get to some quotes where he refers to this quote for the tables are full of vomit and filthiness so there is no no place clean i'd like to go over to first corinthians together if you can i've got several places in the scripture i'd like to read from this evening as the lord leads but let's start with first corinthians chapter 5. this is yeah first corinthians chapter 5 verse 8 therefore let us keep the feasts not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth so paul's admonishing us with to keep this feast amen not in the old form and and in the old form they were to take the leaven the literal physical leaven and purge it out of their dwelling place but now he's telling us to keep this feast within ourselves not with the old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth amen that's how god desires to be worshiped let's let's turn over to the book of revelation together revelation 18. we're going to grab two verses out of revelation first revelation 18 and verse 4. and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and god hath remembered her iniquities reward her even if she rewarded you and double unto her according to her works and the cup which she has filled filled to her double how much she had glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart i said a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow therefore shall our plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is the lord god who judgeth her we know that in the scripture god is passing a judgment on the great the the issue is she doesn't know that she's a she thinks she's a queen she thinks she is no widow she's a married woman she is no widow and she sees no sorrow she believes that she is the bride of christ that she's married to jesus christ and that she's not a widow and that she will see no sorrow she believes that everything is okay but god is trying to show her her real condition and her real condition is as a full of abomination and full of filthiness and so there's nothing clean in her at all there is no clean place in her at all but she doesn't know that for she believes she's the queen of heaven let's turn over to revelation chapter 3. in verse 14. this is speaking to the same church this this is called out in this church age what we just read in the laodicean church agent we're going to read here out of chapter 3 verse 14 and unto the angel the church of the laodiceans write these things saith thee amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that were cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth and brother branham says it makes him sick this church's condition makes him sick it makes him sick to his stomach and he spews it out of his mouth because the everything is mixed or neither cold nor hot but lukewarm and so i spew you out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and know us not thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked this is the same situation that we found the church in the great horror in revelations 18 we found the same situation here she says i am rich increased with goods and have need of nothing and said now knowest not that thou knowest not thou are wretched and miserable poor and blind and naked i counseled thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire and the thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes have that thou may see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent it's the age of zealous repentance you can say laodicean church age is the age of many things but it's also the age of zealous repentance amen when god comes down and shows us the condition of the system we're in and shows us our condition under that system and when we think that we're okay in our mind and everything is fine in our manner of worship and in the denominational system amen god come in this day and he ripped that thing wide open amen so that we could see everything all the tables are full of vomit everything is filthy and unclean amen and then we ran with zealous repentance to get the isab to get the white raiment and get the gold trident fire and it was all provided for us in this day in the message all things in 1962 this is a message i've read and enjoyed brother kyle recommended it to me and and i i listened to it and read it and i enjoyed it very much so i recommend it to you all as well in 1962 the message all things he says what a tragedy it is to see the church in this condition not that i have anything against churches but you see what i mean now no sorrow just a ritualistic form and yet israel was using the word and commandment of god and the churches today take the things out of the bible but there's no sincerity with it this is what i want to labor on for a while there's no sincerity with it amen and and paul was admonishing them to to eat this feast not of the old leaven or the leaven of malice and wickedness but of the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth amen that's the purity by which god wants us not just truth but sincerity and truth not just sincerity with no truth amen there's a lot of sincere worshipers are out there and brother ben said they're truly sincere they're just sincerely wrong because they have no truth amen but there's also those that have truth with no sincerity and it's just as bad but we must eat this feast with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth the church is today taking things out of the bible but there's no sincerity with it and when israel began to take the word and commandments of god and make it a ritual that displeased jehovah the giver of it it was about that time when they made made god's word a ritual that the mighty prophet isaiah appeared on the scene read it isaiah 1 he was sent to israel they hated him and finally sought him to pieces but what did he do he stripped them he said your solemn feast god has refused he said it's become a stink in his nostrils what was it the feast that god ordained for them the new moons and the sabbath and the offerings of sin offerings and so forth that god had given to israel they had made a tradition out of it that's right that god gave them the order god gave them the structure amen but when they took it as a tradition and no longer had sincerity behind it god no longer wanted it god no longer liked it and it was never bringing it was not bringing him pleasure anymore and they were going through the form and thinking everything was okay because this is what moses said this is the form that moses gave us were doing what the bible said but they were doing what the bible said but their heart was not attached to what they were doing their heart was far away they were just going through the motions and it became a tradition to them with no more feeling with no more sincerity and god began to refuse the very worship that he ordained god began to refuse the very system that he set up let's turn to isaiah and read this we can turn together to isaiah chapter 1. in isaiah chapter 1 we'll read from verse 11. isaiah chapter 1 and verse 11 to what purpose is this multitude of your sacrifices unto me oh what a question they could answer the question you told us to do this he's asking them the question to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifice unto me saith the lord i am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fatter fed beast and i delight not in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of he goats when you come to appear before me who have required this at your hand to tread in my courts bring no more vain oblations incense is an abomination unto me who told him how to make the incense who gave him the ingredients to the incense and two whole who told him how to burn it it all came from him it all came from his instructions but now because they took the word of god without sincerity they took it without a feeling they took it without a heart but they made it a ritual now god was displeased and disliked the very thing that he told them how to make and he told them how to burn he says bring no more vain oblations incense is an abomination unto me the new moons and sabbaths the calling of assemblies i cannot away with it it is iniquity even the solemn meeting your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth they are troubling to me i am weary to bear them and when you spread forth your hands i will hide my eyes from you yea when you make many prayers i will not hear your hands are full of blood they were coming according to the tradition according to the commandment and the commandment became a tradition and according to the tradition they were coming to make the offering that they were told to make the way they were told to make it amen but but they didn't have all the commandment correct amen because the commandment to come and approach unto god god gave for a way for man to approach unto him amen so that man might come into fellowship with god and now they were using what god intended to be for fellowship they were using it for a covering because they no longer desired the fellowship with god they wanted the fellowship with the world amen but they still wanted to be justified they still wanted to be okay so they would take what god gave and they were using what god gave for fellowship and to bring communion and oneness with him and then they were using it for self-justification because they really wanted union with the world but they still wanted to be okay thinking they're keeping the word of god but you can't keep the word of god without keeping the purpose and intent of the word of god you can keep all the law and you can keep all the form and you can keep all the structure but if you've gone away from the very intent that god gave for that law you can be keeping every iota of the commandment and not pleasing god because you missed the purpose he gave the commandment for because he wanted fellowship with them he wanted to be their god and he wanted them to be his people he wanted to lead them and he said he made the statement here in verse 14 he said your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth he's the one who gave him the new moons and the appointed feasts and now he was hating it amen because they were misusing his word misusing the commandments misusing the the atonements brother brahm goes on in all things in 1962 he says isaiah spilled it out to spilled it out to them and said god said that he's hiding his face from your prayers you've got your ritualistic form yet it's the truth you're doing what he told you but you're not doing it in sincerity and you squall out day and night but god said your sacrifice is a stink to me and i will not receive it anymore and when you pray under such conditions i'll hide my face from you oh god if people would think of that it would start a pentecost god said though you'd be correctly in the word but if you don't do it with love and sincerity god said he would hide his face and would he wouldn't hear your prayers see that's the way oh you said that you're you're talking under the old testament brother man i'm all right let's take the new testament second timothy three the holy spirit warned us that in the last days that the church would get away from the sincerity and the faith they'd have a form of godliness but would deny the power that went with the right thing having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof yes sir god hates a powerless religion and any religion today that hasn't got christ in it is powerless but any religion that christ is in under his own blood in its got power in it you say god hates a religion without power he said your solemn feast is a stink i guess he does hate it he said it makes me sick and remember he told this rich laodicean church that because you're lukewarm in other words you make me sick i'll spew you out of my mouth and we've come to that age god send us an elisha to chop the thing to pieces lay it out before the people cry out spare not you think he'd be accepted certainly not but he'd cried just the same solemn feast they're a stink god hates powerless religion it's got to have power in it it's got to have sincerity sincerity brings power praise god amen catch this sincerity brings power sincerity brings real worship amen it doesn't matter what we call worship if there's no sincerity in the worship does god receive it amen so when we when we sing we sing with understanding and we sing in the spirit amen not sincerity brings real worship not forms but genuine power worship to know that you pass from death unto life we can sing songs amen but singing songs doesn't equal worship not worship to a true and living god amen but but there's a way to sing amen there's a way to sing that's real worship amen and when you sing with sincerity amen in sincerity and truth amen you're singing in real worship but if we just you know have our ritualistic form of we've got a couple songs we've got the pre-surface music we've got a couple songs we get to the preaching we have a few songs at the end listen it doesn't matter how correct it is and how established it is by the prophet of the age and how much it's in the structure in the form if it's done without sincerity amen it still becomes wrong we can make anything a tradition we can make the message a tradition we can make coming to church a tradition you can make your devotional prayer time amen you can make your time to listen to a message of tape you can make it a tradition amen but what's the thing that keeps a ritualistic form from becoming a tradition because waking up every day and praying is a ritual that right coming to church every sunday and every wednesday is a ritual amen coming to the feast and the new moons and in the daily oblations and the burning of incense it was a ritual but what kept the ritual from becoming a lifeless tradition amen is when you kept the revelation of what it means attached to the thing that we're doing and by revelation and sincerity and what god has done amen it keeps the ritual from becoming a tradition but when we lose sight of the depth of the meaning and what it means and what god has done for us and we lose sight of the love affair between us and the lord amen the ritual can easily become a tradition let's say god i want you to stay foremost in my mind i want to keep you in my heart day and night i don't want anything i do i don't ever want my daily devotion to become a tradition i don't want my prayer time to be a tradition i don't want i don't want the the time i come into church early and sit and get quiet i don't want it to be a tradition amen i want it to be a sincere form of worship i want to become a living reality a love relationship an opportunity for me to seek your face sincerity brings real worship sincerity brings power let's turn to isaiah 29 when you begin to think about a sunday morning if you just begin to think as the sun comes up over the globe and moves and then from country to country in times of the time zone and that sunday how many church services will there be think of it globally how many church services will there be how many worship songs will be sung how many congregations of people will gather together and how many songs will be sung and how many sermons will be preached and how many bible verses will be read how many will have an exciting service or a deep service or a shallow service or a rejoicing service or a great song service or a great whatever it is how many of that will go on in a sunday and how much of that worship is received by a living god the whole babylonian system of religion is flawed it's failed man worshiping according to his own dictates his own desires man worshiping according to his own understanding in his own religion that he has made with his own hands his own idol idolatry it is all in vain isaiah 29 13 says wherefore the lord said for as much as this people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips to honor me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of man i want to read that again because it's such a devastating scripture and it should be a devastating scripture wherefore the lord said for as much as this people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips to honor me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men now you begin to see in the scripture what god really wanted did god want the noise from their lips or did he want their heart he wasn't after the noise from their lips because they draw near me with their lips amen they're speaking of him and singing of him and maybe singing songs about him but their heart is far from him and the fear of the lord the reverence and respect for the lord has just been taught by keeping of commandments by the precepts of men not a real sincere honor and reverence towards god and a real love for him now the the words are there but the heart isn't right and god this is a travesty because god is the one who's offended god is the one who is upset now because that's not why he established the order this is not why he gave them a form of worship this is not why he gave them a place to worship this is not why he set feast days and new moons and oblations and burning of incense and a priesthood he set all that in place so that they could draw nigh unto him so that they could have fellowship with him so he could dwell in their camp and so that they could have a god in their midst so that his presence could be among the nation but it got to the place where the presence of god could leave the nation and they never knew it because they were just doing it through a form of ritual because their heart had been removed brother bam says in the message conference 1963 he says it's back to god's original decision at the first conference eden back to the blood the jew in the old days now i'm coming down home for pentecost just for a few minutes in the old days when god accepted his substitute how the jew used to come down the road with his slick bullock and he'd say you know i'm a sinner jehovah requires me to offer blood so he goes and gets his lamb or his bulldog he takes it down to the high priest down to the temple and he lays his hands upon his sacrifice what does that do that identifies the worshiper with his sacrifice and the priest comes and kills the bullock and catches the blood and sprinkles it upon and this worshiper sincerely knowing this jew that that's what jehovah required of him the man went home with a good feeling feeling the quiver and shake of the lamb the blood spraying all over his hands and so forth and see that little fellow kicking and dying as his throat cut he knowed that he ought to be that one he looked at his sacrifice he identified himself by laying his hands upon it i should be that one and then when that they cut its throat it dying and bleeding and going on the little fellow quivering and quieting down and the worshipers stand there and saying oh jehovah you've accepted that instead of me i'm ashamed of myself and the man went home justified because he had done exactly what jehovah required that was fine but by and by it become a family tradition now he takes his sacrifice say well let's see now oh yes it's getting to be new moon feast i guess i better it's a cleanse in the tabernacle it's a feast of pentecost i guess i better go down offer me a lamb go on down there and kill it with no feelings at all but go on back with the same idea he had coming in there and then what did he do jehovah said here in isaiah speaks a little later on he said your solemn feast had become a stink in my nose ew you know brother ben plays it out so clearly for us that what god wanted he wanted for the man to realize the cost of his sin he wanted to realize that god in his grace and in his mercy was accepting a substitute and the whole act of the substitute was to identify how grievous sin is that it requires the death of an innocent one as a substitute and it was all pointing towards christ and with sincerity the man would come amen recognizing that i'm the one who deserves to die i'm the one that's wrong i i've sinned i have failed and now this poor lamb has to die in my place but when you take all of the revelation and all of the feeling out of it now it's just a way that the man can live any way once and be okay because all he's got to do is do what jehovah said all i got to do is get me a lamb and go down there and give it to the priest he'll slay it and i go home and i'm fine but he was never fine because his heart wasn't right he had obeyed the word amen and god had obeyed the word he had obeyed the commandment but after a while to become a tradition god begins to speak against it against the very thing that he had set up let's turn to matthew 15. pick this up in the new testament here matthew chapter 15. matthew chapter 15 and verse 7. it says ye hypocrites well did isaias prophesy of you saying this people draw nine to me with their mouth and honors me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men god through isaiah was telling a people back then that you've taken what i've given you and you've made it a tradition and now it's become a stink to me is i take no pleasure in it i hate your solemn feast and now jesus comes and he finds the very same thing now in his day and he's looking at them and he's saying well did isaiah is right of you that same spirit is still alive let's turn back and go to back to the old testament but let's go to amos amos chapter 5. amos chapter 5 and verse 21. i hate i despise your feast days you have to remember who gave them the feast days let's not lose sight of that i hate i despise your feast days and i will not smell in your solemn assemblies though you offer me burnt offerings in your meat offerings i will not accept them neither will i regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts take thou away from me the noise of thy songs oh my take thou away from me the noise of thy songs for i will not hear the melody of the viles but let judgment run down as waters and righteousness as a mighty stream have you offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness 40 years old house of israel but you have borne the tabernacle of your moloch and and qin your images the star of your god which you have made to yourselves therefore will i cause you to go into captivity beyond damascus saith the lord whose name is thy god the god of hosts brother baby says in the message the evening messenger in 1963 said isaiah the prophet how he testified prophesied at the end time he said the whole body would come full of putrefied sores every table would be full of vomit why men and women today they take the communion living with two or three wives or two or three husbands right and all kinds smoke cigarettes and all these things come into the church taking communion that's no sincerity in the message communion from 1965 he says you don't take the lord's supper by a tradition you take it because it's the love of god in your heart why do you take communion not just because we have communion in the first service we take it because of the love of god in our hearts you take it because it's the love of god in your heart and keeping the commandments of god see what see that's what you take it for so if you don't take it in sincerity it's just a tradition well our church observes communion every sunday or once every month or twice a year or you go up say well it's my time and then take the communion why it's a stink to god see that's just a tradition even like anything else you've got to be sincere god wants the depths from your heart you remember the very god that brought you here on earth as the one you're serving you're doing this because he said so because it's his order then we want to come up with deepness of sincerity knowing that by god's grace that we have been saved we love him and we feel his presence and we see it changed our life change our lives our whole being is changed we're different people we don't live like we used to we don't think like we used to we come to the communion brother remember just using this as one order one form of the church we come to the communion with this with this in mind a deep love in our heart and a deep sincerity in our heart because of what god's done for us amen what we could not do for ourselves he's done for us and what has he revealed to us in this day that we live in now how we understand more than they've understood in the previous ages of the depths of what that means and what god's done for us the revelation doesn't lighten calvary amen it expands it amen the revelation it shows the full picture of what god's done than the full picture of redemption and we of all people amen should be able to come to everything that god has established with a fullness in our heart we should sing like nobody else on earth sings amen and i don't mean loud i don't mean slow i don't mean fast i'm not talking about that i'm talking about with the deep sincerity in the heart we should sing like nobody else on the planet sings who else knows what god had in the mind the back part of his mind before the foundation of the world who knows with the efforts that he's put in and everything that he's done to get you here this day with this revelation that's here this day how god brought a man from kentucky every church age that lined up just right and he brought empires up and he tore empires down amen and he moved systems and and he moved people and individuals to get you here today that you could receive the revelation of the mystery of god that was in the back part of his mind amen why would we come to church and say i love him [Applause] not us friends not us not here not in me but let me come and say god you've done everything for me where should i be i should be stuck in some system somewhere i should be you know i should be messed up in some wrong marriage i should be messed up in some wrong situation i in my own thinking by my own way and with my own human desires would have ruined my life amen and i was trying running as hard as i can to ruin my life but you grabbed me you picked me up you washed me with clean water you revealed yourself to me and now when i walk when i'm driving the church amen when i'm waking in the morning to listen to the message to to read my bible lord let me not get stuck in a rut lord help me god never to get into into the tradition of a thing but let me never forget what you've done for me every time we open our bibles let's do it with feeling sincerity this is the love letter could you imagine opening the love letter out of a tradition or a formalistic ritual because it was commanded to you by the prophet that you know a christian prays and reads his bible every day he has to well better open the love letter that's not how you open a love letter you open the love letter you smell it and you touch it amen god wrote this for me god sent a prophet and they revealed the words in this book for me there may be others included in this too but right now when i'm opening this book and the privacy of my home i'm not interested in who else he wrote it for he wrote it for me he revealed it to me amen he sent the prophet for me it should affect everything we do we cannot assume that just because we've received the message of the hour that we're immune from all the vices that go with the human life but we've got to guard against these things because the outer man is to be brought subject to the inner man god will keep his bride correct his bride wake up his bride because he won't lose her amen but i don't want him to have to chase me down and spank me because i was not diligent with what he told me when he does thank me i'm thankful because as rod and his staff they comfort me but i want to give of a willing heart i want to do everything i do with the deepness of sincerity and the love that he deserves when i bow my head and pray i want to pray with thanksgiving in my heart even if it's praying over a meal like i've done thousands of times when i bow my head i don't want to say god thank you for this food we all get into those habits but i want to stop that and i want to say god provided this for me i want to take it with thanksgiving in my home let's turn to jeremiah chapter 7. see if you think about where israel was they had the promise of abraham in their life they were placed in the promised land but through circumstances in a prophecy they went out of the land and they went into egypt and they were sold into slavery in bondage in egypt for generations and but god with a mighty hand by his great mercy and his great love he rescued them he brought them out of egypt amen and he showed how mighty and powerful he was amen when he destroyed egypt and destroyed pharaoh's army and he brought them out with a mighty hand and they come out mighty victors with the spoil all because of god not because of them they had no strength no power but they come out with gold and they come out with precious metal and jewels and with garments they come out singing and they come out dancing they came out the victor amen because of him and he brought them through the wilderness journey and he shielded them from all forces and and he moved them into the promised land and he drove out the inhabitants of the land and he gave him a temple and he gave him a priesthood and he gave him all these things that he gave to them and they started off grateful they started off thankful but then generation by generation and one day leads into the next day and the next day becomes just like the day before and tomorrow has no prospect of being different than today and they begin to get into a rhythm of life and they began to forget they didn't keep in the forefront of their hearts and their minds what god had done for them and then because they failed to drive out all the inhabitants of the land like they were instructed they didn't keep the full word now those things that they put under tribute they began to come back and they began to entice them and they began to get enticed with the gods of the land and the other forms of worship and they began to to mix the worship of jehovah with the worship of baal and some of these other gods and they kept the ritual going they kept the ritual and it became a tradition amen but because they had settled down and quit striving quit reaching forth in the spirit quit seeking his face quit desiring more of his presence they got happy with the portion that they were given they become content amen and didn't drive out all the inhabitants they became content with what they had and contentment turned into complacency and then now the the the devils that were around them begin to tempt them they quit fighting now they begin to get tempted and now they begin to worship jehovah out of tradition and not with the sincerity that was in their hearts let's look at jeremiah chapter 7 verse 9. will you steal murder and commit adultery and swear falsely and burn incense to baal and walk after other gods whom you knew not and come and stand before me in this house which is called by my name and say we are delivered to do all these abominations he said will you really do everything i told you not to do and come into this house and worship and worship and say we've been delivered delivered to do what deliver to keep all the abominations and the murders and the lie and the false this and that they've gotten so desensitized they've gone to a place amen where they can come to church amen they could listen and listen to the priest they could do the form and the ritual and they could continue on in the compromise they were in amen and they got so ritualistic in their worship and they got so uh they lost touch with the feeling and heart for god that their selfishness and their self-desire would come into manifestation and all these things but they would still go to the house of god and they would still worship and say we're delivered to do all of these things my my mind verse 11 is this house which is called by my name become a den of robbers in your eyes behold even i have seen it saith the lord but go you now into my place which is in shiloh where i set my name at first and see what i did to it for the wickedness of my people israel and now because you have done all these works saith the lord and i spake unto you rising up early and speaking but you heard not and i called you but you answered not therefore will i do unto this house which is called by my name wherein you trust and unto the place which i gave to you to your fathers as i have done to shiloh and i will cast you out of my sight as i have cast out all your brethren even the whole seed of ephraim therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up cry nor prayer for them neither make intercession to me for i will not hear thee you tell jeremiah jeremiah is now speaking to judah amen the nation of israel has already been carried away captive by the assyrians and now the babylonians are going to come to take judah and benjamin and now he's speaking to them and he's starting to declare what the problem is what the issue is they've lost sincerity they've lost the feeling for god they were keeping the ritual just so that they could be okay but they were still involved in all these things that god hated and god is telling them you think that i'm going to let this go on look at shiloh he said look at shiloh and when you know what shiloh is when they came amen when they came into the land amen joshua comes and he sets up the tabernacle in shiloh shiloh becomes the first seat of religion in the middle of israel in joshua 18 1 i'll just read it to you and the whole congregation of the children of israel assembled together at shiloh and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there and the land was subdued before them so joshua was the first place that god had set his tabernacle and when they all were to gather for their feast when they were all the required gathering of all the men of israel three times a year would come to shiloh amen and shiloh god had established but he says now look at shiloh if you want to know what's going to happen look at shiloh god had placed his tabernacle in shiloh god had put his presence in shiloh god had told him to gather the shiloh but at that time shiloh was a waste place let's turn to the book of psalms psalm 78. psalm 78 and verse 50. psalm 78 and 50. he made a way to his anger he spared not their soul from death but gave their life over to pestilence and smote all the firstborn in egypt the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of ham but made his own people to go forth like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock and he led them on safely so that they feared not but to see overwhelm their enemies and he brought them to the border of this of a sanctuary even to his mountain which his right hand had purchased he cast out the heathen also before them and divided them an inheritance by line and he made the tribe of israel to dwell in their tents yet they tempted and provoked the most high god and kept modest testimonies but turned back and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers they were turned aside like a deceitful bow for they provoked him to anger with their high places and moved him to jealousy with their graven images when god heard this he was wroth and greatly aboard israel so that he forsook the tabernacle of shiloh the tent which he placed among men and delivered his strength into captivity in his glory unto the enemy's hand he gave his people over also into the sword and was wrath with his inheritance you picked this story up in first samuel chapter four but in the days of samuel as a boy and eli as the high priest and eli's two sons they were in shiloh ministering unto the lord in shiloh and they were gathering unto shiloh and the the tabernacle was there and the ark of the covenant was there but there was wickedness that was taking place in the worship in the tabernacle because uh hoffney and phineas the two sons of eli they were wicked amen and eli would bring no correction to them and so so the priesthood became wicked and it became to have an ill effect among the people and this was shiloh this was the place that god set his tabernacle this is the place where god would meet his people but when the worship was polluted and corrupted and they no longer had a heart for god there come a day that the philistines were gathering against them and they lost in battle and they said let us go get the ark amen and bring the ark forth and and they they believed when they brought the ark forth it would bring forth the presence of god and they brought the ark forth and and and they moved it into battle amen and the philistines conquered him that day and took the ark that's why in psalms it said he delivered his strength unto enemies he gave the very ark amen which is a symbol of his presence his seat among him his throne in the tabernacle and he allowed the philistines to carry it away and it became captive to the philistines you think how could god do a thing like that amen god it'll never happen to us it'll they'll never let the philistines take his seat god's more powerful amen god was showing i have removed my presence from you amen i'm no longer with you and god was not worried about the seat god was worried about his relationship with them amen that article of furniture only represented his presence over the word in the in the holy place in the holy of holies amen it was a representation but he was going to allow that piece of furniture which was so holy to them which was so sacred to them he was going to allow it to go to the philistines and become captive by dirty hands and be brought into a heathen camp because god wasn't interested in the furniture he was interested in them god will then allow his tabernacle that he instructed moses to build and gave details on how to build it and build it as a reflection of the one in heaven he would allow it to fall into ruin say how could he do it he was doing it because he was trying to free the people from their tradition he was trying to break them away from their traditional understanding and realize that they needed him amen they needed him they didn't need a ritual they needed him they didn't need a form they didn't need a covering they needed him they needed him to be their covering they needed him to be their form they needed him to be their ritual when they lost sight of him he let everything else that was so holy and so pure and so right fall into ruin praise god praise god amen let's go to jeremiah 24. you realize in shiloh that day when those corrupt priests took and thought they were going to bring the presence of god over the word of god into the battle and there's no way we'll lose because we've got the tat we've got the tablets of stone that god gave the covenant between us and him us and god in the place he told us to put it the very word from his own hand in the very vessel he told us to put it carried by the very priesthood that he established there's no way this will not work and what looked like a surefire plan to take the word of god into battle and with the word will have his presence and nothing can defeat it and when they go into battle and not only are they defeated but it's taken how could god do it how could god do it amen because god was not going to back up their false worship he was no longer going to support their corrupt heart amen their heart had pulled far from him there was a corruption in the priesthood and he was no longer going to support him they will take the word of god it will never fail if your heart is not right if your heart is not right god may very well let it fail so you recognize your heart's not right because god is never wrong and god has never failed it's not a repeating of something it's not an incantation it's not a just a bold claim of something amen it's a sincere worship to god and a revelation of his word amen and a heart that's connected to god and a real connection with god and a belief knowing that he's god and his word won't fail but they were just trying to use it for their own benefit because they didn't reverence it those two priests that were now carrying the word they were the very ones committing fornication right next to that holy place right within the tabernacle they were committing fornication showing that they had no reverence no fear no respect for that word but when the demon powers come against them and they needed a victory they tried to take the word and forced the word into action but they had no reverence for the very word that they were now carrying we want to claim the word and claim the promise but do we have reverence for the very promise have we been committing spiritual fornication right in the presence of the very ark that we're now trying to carry help us god help us god to come reverently and humbly to him every moment of every day and stay so close to him that when we need him we know he's close and we know he's here we don't play games with god we don't play games with god's word jeremiah 24 4 and i will set up shepherds over them no i'm sorry i'm in the wrong verse 24 and 4. again the word of the lord came unto me saying thus saith the lord the god of israel like those good figs so will i acknowledge them that are carried away captive of judah whom i have sent out of this place into the land of the chaldeans for their good for their good god was now breaking up judah he was now bringing jerusalem captive and he showed a vision unto jeremiah of good figs and bad figs and the good figs are the ones he's talking about he's going to carry them away to the land of chaldeans for their good you say how could this be for their good verse 6 for i will set mine eyes upon them for good and i will bring them again to this land and i will build them and not pull them down and i will plant them and not pluck them up and i will give them a heart to know me that i am the lord and they shall be my people and i will be their god for they shall return unto me with their whole heart he's passed the judgment through jeremiah that because of the corruption amen that is in jerusalem because of the insincerity and the lack of love in their worship he was going to allow the whole thing to go captive and he was going to allow nebuchadnezzar to come in and take them captive and he was going to allow them to destroy the very temple that solomon built surely surely god won't let this temple be destroyed god let it be destroyed god prophesied that it would happen god prophesied that they would be led captive and he said i will take these good figs to the land of chaldeans for their own good i will separate them from the word i will separate them from jerusalem amen from the church i will separate them for their own good so that i can bring them back and when they come back they will have a heart for me amen they will love me they will worship me they will know me what are we looking at the church ages already in the first church age in the ephesian church age he's talking to them and says i have somewhat against you because you've left your first love they had the word they they had the epistles that were written by the apostles and by paul amen but they begin to already cool off they begin already settled into a form and they had already left their first love in ephesus means aimed at and relaxed they had aimed at but they they no longer had a desire to reach forth in the spirit they became comfortable in the worship amen they begin to relax he says you've left your first love and we know that the address to the church ages is addressing two groups and god is speaking to each church age because within each church gates two groups and he's telling them you've left your first love and he's going to allow this church to be carried captive to babylon he's going to allow the word to be separated from them is that true down through thyatira through the dark ages they ban bibles they burn them they made it they forbid you'd have a bible in your language they forbid it to be translated into the language of the common tongue so only the priest had the bible and only in latin so that you had the word the word had been removed from the church they had been taken captive in the babylon and the thyatiran age they were captive in babylon why for your good amen so that he could return her captivity let's look at jeremiah 29 very familiar scripture but i want to read it in this context the context that is placed here in the scriptures jeremiah 29 and 10 for thus saith the lord that after seventy years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you and perform my good word towards you and causing you to return to this place god before he sent them away was prophesying of their coming back so the question what was more important to him the sending away or the coming back for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart something's going to change in the return amen something is going to be different with the group that comes back out of captivity out of babylon they're not going to be like the group that went in it's going to be different when they come back and god is prophesying he's saying i will bring you back to this place i know the thoughts i have towards you to give you an expected end it only looks like evil but it's really good the church ages looked evil but they were really good it looked like it was all bad but there was something wonderful it was a mystery laying in the seven church ages and it was a mystery of the restoration of the bride tree he says i want to read verse 12 again then shall you call upon me o praise god why did they call upon him because he already prophesied they would be there he already knew there would be a remnant there would be a group you know when it came time to come back out of 70 years of captivity they didn't all want to come back they had got comfortable in babylon they looked comfortable under the the benefits they still had a form of their jewish tradition they still had jewish worship but they got comfortable in the benefits of babylon and they liked babylon and now when they had the opportunity to come back they didn't all come back some refused to come back but he knew there would be a people that would come back because he already saw it he already predestinated and he already prophesied that they would come back in verse 12 then shall you call upon me and say why did they call upon him because he said they would because he said they would and you shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart and i will be found of you saith the lord and i will turn away your captivity and i will gather you from all the nations from all the places whether i have driven you sayeth the lord and i will bring you again unto the place once i cause you to be carried away captive oh praise god god took the very thing that he built and he broke it the very thing it looked like it'd be impossible he'll never destroy jerusalem he'll never he'll never let the vessels be carried away he'll never let us lose the ark of the covenant he'll never tear down solomon's temple and he let it all go to ruin but he had a remnant he was looking for they were going to go captive for a little while into babylon but in due season he was going to bring a remnant out of that and he was going to bring them back into the place of worship back to the proper place of worship bring him back to jerusalem back to the restoration of the temple back to the word and he said you'll be there don't worry you'll be there and you'll call and i'll answer you'll hear my word you'll be there because i predestinated you to be there there will be a remnant that will come out of babylon i broke the system for your good. and when the churches began to fall into tradition into routine through ephesus through cerner through through pergamus amen he allowed them to go captive in the babylon and broke them because he didn't want this church to continue on that way he wanted them to have a love relationship with him he wanted to have a revelation of what was in his mind he wanted to share with them his very person but he couldn't do it under that ritualistic form under that tradition of man amen so he broke the thing and let it go into complete darkness as if it was dead he let it he let those insects eat the fruit eat the leaves eat the bark i mean their doctrine and then the very life they sucked the sap until it got down to just a stump and said god didn't let that happen he prophesied before it happened he wrote it in revelation chapter 2 and chapter 3 before it ever happened he wrote it back in joel before it ever happened god knew it would happen because he had to break that thing so that you and i would seek him with all of our heart so that you and i would come to him and seek him and be found of him when he was breaking that system he had you in mind when that church was going into captivity he had you in mind you see why this is not going to be a tradition to us amen the bride is not going to let this truth become a tradition the bride is not going to let this become a ritualistic form of some family tradition a multi-generational form of worship because she was the one that he broke it for he broke it for this bride he broke the system let it go into ruin so that he could gradually bring it back so that when you come he would you would call he would answer that he would have a people not like the people who went into babylon but the people coming out would be the people that would seek for him with all of their hearts let's turn to the book of joel praise be to god you know we wonder why we've been so many things been through so much trouble it's almost like for individual lives some individual lives have taken the same route sometimes we think that sometimes we think that the worst thing that ever happens to somebody is that the church depart over the group or the system or the whatever movement within the message gets all broke up they get dispersed and we lose track of them sometimes it's the best thing that ever happened god breaks something and he scatters the people so that in his due season he can bring them back and when they come back there are people that are going to call on him with all of their heart amen they've learned something something has changed and the church ages are there for us amen to gain an understanding not to go that way sometimes we think a young person amen going out and getting broken and separating from the world that's the worst thing that could ever happen and no doubt there's scars and trouble that will come but maybe that's the very thing that god saw before the foundation of the world because it's the very thing that's going to cause them to seek for him with all of their heart they may have been getting into a ritualistic form into a traditional formula and god didn't want that for his bride he did not want that for your child your loved one so he would break them break them and scatter them away from the word say how can he do it how can he do it because he's already saul i will bring you back amen you're coming back to this place you won't be scattered forever you won't be separated forever you're coming back and i'd like to say come back to jerusalem amen it's time for the in gathering of the gods seed come back i will bring you back and you will seek for me you will find me when you seek for me you will call and i will listen you will find me that's a prophecy there's no guessing at that you will find me when you search for me with all of your heart why were those coming out of captivity willing to search with all their heart because they had been sent out into captivity they no longer had the false security of the tradition they no longer had the false security of the system amen that thing was broken so that they could find the security that comes from seeking him with all of their hearts and the very thing god broke when they come back with the right approach and the right heart he would have him build back the very thing that he broke up because the form wasn't wrong the ritual wasn't wrong the worship wasn't wrong their heart was wrong and the very thing that got broken so that they could get scattered when he brings them back he'll have them build back the very thing that he destroyed praise our god joel chapter 2 verse 23 be glad then ye children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the vats shall be overflowing with wine and oil and i will restore to you the years that the locusts had eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the palmer worm my great army whose army god's army brother brenham uses this and he preached when he preaches he uses this verse to preach the restoration of the bride tree that this is god's army that he allowed to eat the fruit to eat the leaves fellowship to eat the bark doctrine to suck the sap which was the life why because he broke that thing and let it go captive because he already foreshadowed it in the old testament now it's living out in the new testament so that he can bring a people back and the people who come back are not going to fall by the same way when they went in they're coming back with a heart for god and they want god and god only i will restore how is he going to restore he's going to bring the former and latter rain together the former rain is the teaching reign the in the in the seventh church age messenger brought back the teaching the doctrine restored to the church all the loose ends that was left out over seven church ages the former reign brought it all back together then he's going to send the latter rain or the harvest rain the final rain before the harvest and that fell at the opening of the seals and what's he doing he's bringing the former and latter rain together in the first month why because when this happens you go back to the beginning you go back to one you go back to what the church was meant to be in the very beginning of pentecost now the former atlanta reign falls together and in that day i will restore all that the palmer worm all the cankerworm all that the locust palmer wore my great army which i sent among you and you shall eaten plenty what kind of eaties eating is he talking about he's talking about the kind of eating we're doing here tonight friends he's being fed from the manna from heaven fed from the word of god and you shall eaten plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that i am in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed that day is this day amen he has restored he has brought the former and latter reign to bring back amen all that was lost through the church ages and all that we had been separated from and all that was broken and all the word that was lost he's restored that full word again why because he wants us to have a relationship with him not with the commandment with him he's the giver of the commandment he doesn't want us to follow the ritual he wants us to seek after him he wants us to do what he said do it's not that he says no there's no point coming to church now brother chad that's not the point the point is this time around when he rebuilds that tabernacle and he sets the incense in place and he sets the priesthood in place and he says the sacrifice in place and the feast of new moons and the daily oblation now everything they do was a full feeling now they now they wake up in the morning and all of a sudden that morning oblation goes up and they all look out of their tents towards towards the mount moriah and they see the wisp of smoke going up because the priest is offering the morning oblation and every one of them with tears in their eyes say thank god he's restored us it's no longer a tradition it was the same act but it was all different amen it's the same kind of church gathering the same kind of people the same kind of pre-service and songs and a preaching and a closing but it's all different now amen the same kind of daily devotion the same kind of devotions with your family the same kind of morning prayer and evening prayers it's the same kind of thing but it's all different now friends because god wanted it that way he had to break it so that he could scatter and at the end of the church ages he could bring us back and that he would have a people that would seek for him with all of their heart this time he's going to have a people that won't make the service of god a family tradition they won't make it a traditional thing a ritualistic thing with no feeling but everything god said do they said i'll do it but i'll do it with a full heart let's read one more scripture as we close in first timothy first timothy chapter one first timothy chapter 1 verse 5. first timothy 1 5. now the end of the commandment is is stop there don't read no more the end of the commandment this is the finish this is what it's all about this is why he gave commandments this is why the law was here the end the finishing the completion of the commandments of god is this the end of the commandment is charity agape love capstone love out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and a faith unfeigned this is what it's all been about friends all the bringing out of egypt in the mount sinai meeting and the word that was given in the temple that was set up and the destruction of and the casting out and the re-gathering amen and then christ coming and then then a church being brought out and then they're being eaten down by these four insects and they're re-gathering back out of babylon what's it all been about it's been all to get a people like this that will serve god from a heart with love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith with no hypocrisy unfaint a genuine faith a clear conscience and love out of a pure heart when you look back you read our bible the love letter we look back at history what god's done all of it as the beginner bride to get a bride on earth in this day in this condition i say oh god i need you i can't do it on my own i can't do it by myself but just as sure as you said through jeremiah that you will have a people and they will be found of you they will seek you with all their heart they will call and you will hear this is sure is that prophecy you've prophesied that you'll have a bride without spot or wrinkle at the end and i'm trusting in that prophecy i'm trusting in what you told us through the prophet i can't do it myself but i believe i'm one of them and may god i approach everything i do with that revelation with that heart can we read one more scripture let's go to psalms 137 musicians if you'll come brother ben if you'll make your way up psalms 137 i don't know why i can't get this scripture off my mind i didn't put in my notes and i said i wasn't going to preach on it but i can't get it off my heart psalms 137 verse 1 by the rivers of babylon there we sat down yea we wept when we remembered zion zion is the bride we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song and that they that wasted us required of us mirth saying sing us one of the songs of zion listen friends listen put your spiritual jacket on amen amen we were carried away into babylon into this babylonian religion into this denominational system we were carried away into it and we didn't mourn and weep when we thought about what the bride was meant to be what she was supposed to be versus what she is in this denominational debauchery and we begin to weep amen and we took our harp we couldn't even sing the songs of zion with joy anymore because everything was in ruin we hung our harp on the willows but those that had taken us captive under the and the heartless they demanded of us a song how can i sing when the bride's out of place how can i sing when the brides in room in jerusalem and zions how can i sing but they demanded of us a song oh praise god and they that wasted us required of us mirth saying sing us one of the songs of zion how shall we sing the lord's song in a strange land if i forget the old jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning if i do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if i prefer not jerusalem above my chief joy god was accomplishing his purpose when they were separated and god was accomplishing his purpose through this denominational system when he had us separated from what the bride was supposed to be we hung our harp on the willows how can i sing the songs of zion when i'm separated from what i'm supposed to be but god sent a prophet in this day to show us the way back to bring back and return our captivity to come back to zion to come back to the church that she was meant to be at pentecost to come back to be the bride that he had four ordained before the foundation of the world when his heart's purpose was to have a bride of his own choosing now he's brought her out of captivity he's brought her out of babylon out of the denominations out of their own thinking out of traditionalism out of formalism and brought them back and i say it's time to take our harps down and sing a song amen to rejoice and sing with a full heart amen not because they required of us a song not because they require within earth but we're back in zion friends it's time to sing to rejoice to make our heart connected with what we're saying amen to let our heart connect with what's being preached connect with what the prophet said amen connect with our bridegroom what a day we live in friends there's no day for formalism no day for tradition this is the day for the reality of all things zion has come back amen he's brought her out of her captivity he's washed her with clean water he sprinkled her he set her in place now he's whispering love secrets in her ear and she's singing with mirth and joy and gladness and thanksgiving he broke the system to scatter the elect to bring them back so that we won't repeat the process let's not let formalism creep around us friends let's be guarded against it he peeled the seals back so we could see what that spirit was and how that spirit operated so that we wouldn't fall prey to the same spirit this is not the day to repeat the process this is the day to go free amen this is the day you prophesied let's all stand and when we sing let's sing with mirth and joy in our heart for there's never been a day like this day man brother ben you got a song brother [Music] make me more likely [Music] break and bless [Music] let me be [Music] by the fire of your spirit [Music] and make [Music] and bless the broken [Music] let me be [Music] how many of you happy that he broke the system and he exposed it through a prophet in this day that exposed it like isaiah didn't like jeremiah did and explained to us what happened so that we wouldn't repeat i'm so glad he broke the system i'd like to say many many here many have been through all kinds of different trials and church fellowships and things that have broke up and maybe even family situations that have broke up or friendship and you wonder why did that ever happen it might have been for your good right it just might have been to free us so that we wouldn't get caught in something that that would become a tradition or a habit or a ritual and many things have happened and disappointing and discouraging things and many things we thought would last forever are broken [Music] but it's not like god hasn't worked like that before people we love broken and separated from zion maybe that's for their good [Music] maybe we would look at what happened to israel as they get carried away captive babylon say oh that's bad but god said i did it for their good they said it's bad but if you knew the prophecy you'd say it's good many times there's loved ones and young people and other ones that that have gotten carried away been broken away and separated away oh if we just knew the predestinated plan of god if we could just see what he's already prophesied over them if we could see the plan that he had to give them a heart that would cry unto him maybe that was the only way and if that was the only way then that's the perfect way [Music] i'm sure that day in jerusalem when they were all being gathered up on ox carts and whatever else and forced to walk and being led away i'm sure they all felt like it was a bad day but oh if they just believe the prophecy they would know that all things work together for good that it's good when we look back and we look on the relationships that are broken up and the fellowships of believers that were broken up and the movements and the church systems and the whatever else families you know what let's just say it had to be that way so that i would have a heart that was connected only to him so that i would call and he would answer he had a plan of good and not evil to bring me to an expected end and if all of that was required to get my heart dialed into him to on the same frequency where i would love him and him only then i say thank you lord it's what i needed [Music] god breaks so that he can free and he brings back together with a prophecy it'll be different this time and that's the
