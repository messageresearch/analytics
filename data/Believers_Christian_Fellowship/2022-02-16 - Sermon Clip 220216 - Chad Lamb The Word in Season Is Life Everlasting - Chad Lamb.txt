TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the world is falling apart we talked about this sunday who wants to fly away and run away and go live off-grid somewhere in the mountains but you take life when you pull back into the mountains you pull life back into the mountains when you keep away from everybody keep your head down talk to nobody refute you pull life back from the world god did not tell his disciples i'll pray to get you out of the world but i'll pray that god will keep you from the evil in the world we have to be here to shine light amen she will be the final voice to the final age it's not trivial it's not light it's powerful it is life amen we're carrying life we're bearing life we're presenting life we're sharing life it's everlasting life it isn't the message as a form of church and a form of teaching in a form of adherence to codes that's not it friends it's you and christ as persons together sharing life demonstrating life being life man it's not it's not time to settle down into a church and and i'm in the message that term can mean anything it has become it has turned into anything anything you want to be the message has been the message and it's it's a loosely attached to brother branham in one way or another loosely or firmly however you do that if there's an attachment to the messenger saying we believe the message amen but i want to do more than believe the message because the devil believes the message i want to be the message amen i want to be the manifestation of the word for this day and i could only do it if he chose me before the foundation of the world amen if it's his choosing not mine i can't make myself that but if he made me before the foundation of the world then that's my place and i want to be that so how do you be that brother chad you yield yourself to this word and then stop resisting it stop explaining it away stop trying to form it into our own understanding or package it into the package we're most comfortable with but come back to the message and say if that's the way god presented it that's the way i believe it if that's the way the prophet taught it that's the way i believe it if that's the way god wanted me to receive his word and god instructed me then that is the way that i believe it and that's the way i receive it
