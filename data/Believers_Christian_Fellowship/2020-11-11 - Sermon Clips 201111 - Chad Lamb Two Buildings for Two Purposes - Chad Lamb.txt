========================================

what brother ben is telling us he's not just telling us the story of nimrod he's showing us the seed the beginning how this thing started and we'll get into religion where people will go out on a drinking drunken spree with adultery and all of that on a friday night as long as they can go to the confessional booth on saturday and confess it what are they doing they're climbing up the tower of babel to go to heaven to sing to come back down to earth to live any way they want you say well that's the catholic church i tell you friends the protestants are guilty of the same thing and we can be guilty of it in the message too i do my religious duty i do my devotion i say i believe the message but i still at the core of it do what i want to do anyways the truth friends seen people make choices amen that are contrary to the word of god contrary to the message amen but they'll stay religious amen and they'll stay in the church or stay in the message amen and if one church doesn't accept their unbelief amen and their disobedience to the word they'll just leave that church and go find another one and stay there why because they want a tower of babel they don't want a relationship with god so we don't want to just say confessional booth amen and you know we that's a clear-cut example amen but the devil's a lot trickier than that amen he's going to slip in if he can get us to build our own tower of babel and we can take the message and manipulate it to our own understanding and build our own tower where we feel like we can climb up and sing with the angels amen and go back down and live any way we want it doesn't work that way man i mean we've seen the scene with my own eyes i've seen amen things change since we come into the message dress and attire and attitudes and activities places we used to not want to go to restaurants we wouldn't go into amen and places vacations we wouldn't take amen and we act in ways and do things and play games and dress in ways we just not when we come to the message 20 years ago we wouldn't do it maybe we just got smarter i don't want to be smarter i don't want to live my own life i want to surrender my life i want to be that simple sheep herder says god i don't know i get so tangled up in myself sometimes i think i'm right and i find out i'm wrong sometimes i think i'm righteous and i find out it's only selfishness god you've got to judge me god you got to take your word and shake me i can't do this on my own amen
