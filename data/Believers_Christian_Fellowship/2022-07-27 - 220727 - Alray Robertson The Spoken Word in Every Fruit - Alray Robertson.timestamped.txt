[18:13] moment i feel bad to keep you standing
[18:15] thank you very much musicians god bless
[18:17] you
[18:21] something i i can say of brother chad is
[18:23] that there's a genuine humility
[18:26] and a love for his sheep that has been
[18:29] such an example to me
[18:31] um i i will never forget
[18:34] when when we were in
[18:36] the philippines a few years ago
[18:38] um the morning
[18:40] we were going down to the uh to have
[18:42] breakfast and brother chad got out of
[18:45] the lift
[18:46] out of what do you call it here elevator
[18:49] elevator
[18:50] and uh as he was getting out he he said
[18:53] to me because i was taking the service
[18:55] that that morning
[18:56] and he said to me brother i was lying
[18:58] awake at night and i was praying for you
[19:01] and it just means so much you know just
[19:03] we're all part of the same body and we
[19:05] just want to you know bear one another
[19:08] up before the lord and we're all working
[19:10] for the same goal it's no big one here
[19:12] and little one there god is good and god
[19:14] uses each one of us different we are
[19:16] very different
[19:18] you probably hear my accent is different
[19:20] i trust you can understand me all right
[19:23] i'll say like brother banham says about
[19:24] the dutchman take me for what i mean not
[19:27] for what i say
[19:29] so i trust that you can just have a
[19:30] blessed time i also just want to
[19:32] remember to bring the regards from so
[19:35] many saints back home
[19:37] there's a number of you that's visited
[19:39] us back there and and
[19:42] each one of you were mentioned by the
[19:44] name to say please pass on regards and
[19:46] various people in church i'm just going
[19:48] to do a global god bless you from from
[19:50] back home
[19:51] also from my wife paula she she
[19:54] specially asked me please express my
[19:56] love
[19:57] and i want to also do that she
[20:00] her heart is here tonight she would have
[20:01] liked to be here with me and to be able
[20:03] to see you all and fellowship with you
[20:05] all so i don't want to take any more
[20:07] time but i wonder let's just stand for a
[20:09] moment and turn in our bibles to genesis
[20:11] chapter 1.
[20:16] i'm sure you'll find that real easy
[20:19] genesis chapter 1
[20:21] and we're going to read
[20:22] verses 11 and 12.
[20:35] and god called the dry land earth and
[20:37] the gathering together of the water
[20:39] called the seas i'm sorry i started at
[20:41] verse 10. let's try 11. and god said let
[20:44] the earth bring forth grass the herb
[20:46] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[20:48] yielding fruit are for his kind whose
[20:50] seed is in itself upon the earth
[20:54] and it was so
[20:55] and the earth brought forth grass and
[20:57] her building seed after his kind and the
[21:00] tree yielding fruit whose seed was in
[21:02] itself after his kind and god saw that
[21:06] it was good
[21:07] and i want to just focus on that little
[21:09] clause there which says after he's kind
[21:12] every seed bringing forth after his kind
[21:14] we're just going to read that that far
[21:16] let's just pray one more time before we
[21:18] before we take our seats precious father
[21:21] [Music]
[21:23] lord there's so
[21:24] so much power in your word father
[21:28] oh lord i just recently just
[21:32] felt overwhelmed lord by the privilege
[21:34] of standing here at the end of time
[21:37] having the privileged lord to see this
[21:39] word open
[21:41] to see so much of your word fulfilled
[21:44] or jesus to have the benefit lord of
[21:46] hindsight to look back over the ages and
[21:49] see how the prophecies
[21:51] came out exactly as you said lord
[21:54] father we were not sitting 2000 years
[21:56] ago or anywhere in between father
[21:59] guessing when you would return not
[22:00] knowing what age we were in or nothing
[22:02] father but we know where we're at lord
[22:05] oh father we just thank you for it lord
[22:08] we are such privileged people lord our
[22:10] father tonight i just want to ask again
[22:13] lord that you will anoint your word
[22:14] father i pray that you will take me out
[22:16] of the way let me maybe not be aware of
[22:19] myself lord and just surrender to the
[22:21] leading of your precious holy spirit
[22:24] have your way father i pray that you
[22:25] will shut my mouth for anything that is
[22:27] not of you or jesus but that you will
[22:29] speak your oracles lord i committed to
[22:32] you i pray that your holy spirit the
[22:34] inner teacher will take this word and
[22:35] guide it to exactly the right places in
[22:37] each life according to our need we ask
[22:40] it in the precious name of our lord
[22:42] jesus christ amen amen you may take your
[22:45] seats
[22:49] so
[22:50] i will i will start off by
[22:52] a little bit of an escape clause i trust
[22:54] it's okay to take my jacket off
[22:56] i'm used to winter weather at the moment
[22:59] so this is nice and warm
[23:01] um so i'll say this that you know if
[23:06] what i find is when you travel sometimes
[23:08] um you have different terminology that
[23:11] you use for the same concept
[23:14] or sometimes you know everyone everyone
[23:16] looks at the mountain from a slightly
[23:18] different angle and saying things
[23:19] slightly different so if if the way you
[23:22] you hear me saying it
[23:23] is a little different to what you used
[23:25] to please forgive me and i want to say
[23:27] you've got a wonderful pastor and i'm
[23:29] not here to go against anything that
[23:31] that he's teaching you i i really
[23:33] respect him and so forth but i just want
[23:36] to use a
[23:38] a brother nestor quote he says i just
[23:40] want to come to be a blessing and i feel
[23:42] like that tonight i just want to be a
[23:44] blessing so if you can get a blessing
[23:45] tonight then then it's worth the while
[23:48] so i've been preaching a little series
[23:51] at home where i was speaking about the
[23:53] different gifts in the body and and it's
[23:55] a subject that had been taught on a lot
[23:57] and that's not my main focus tonight but
[23:59] i just thought i'll just drop that in
[24:01] because some of the things i will speak
[24:04] on
[24:04] is very applicable to that thought that
[24:06] each one of us have have one or more in
[24:10] probably in all our cases multiple gifts
[24:12] and things that god uses and he uses it
[24:15] in the body so i just wanted to throw
[24:16] that in as a little bit of a background
[24:19] now
[24:20] we read in our opening scripture in the
[24:23] book of genesis how god works on a
[24:25] principle in his creation that every
[24:28] seed brings forth of its
[24:30] kind and that's a god-given law and
[24:33] that's how god created it
[24:35] and god is consistent in this way
[24:38] there's no oopsies right there's no oh
[24:41] my goodness what happened here i planted
[24:43] a pumpkin and tomorrow tomato is coming
[24:45] up
[24:47] when when the seed goes into the ground
[24:49] the result that comes out the fruit that
[24:51] comes out is the evidence of what the
[24:53] seed was that went in
[24:55] now of course we know the the practical
[24:57] application of this the the life of
[25:00] christ that went into the seed that
[25:01] original original seed that went in
[25:05] comes forth
[25:06] and it bears fruit and when we look at
[25:08] the fruit we know what the original seed
[25:11] was amen
[25:12] so when we look at attributes of god
[25:14] being manifested then we know that it
[25:17] comes from the gene of god
[25:19] i mean so now
[25:21] when we look around us when we walk out
[25:23] the doors and we see things happening in
[25:24] this world
[25:26] we are surrounded by satan's eden
[25:29] we're surrounded by so much filth
[25:32] and and everything we see is proof and
[25:35] evidence of the fact
[25:37] that there was not only godly seed sowed
[25:41] we see around us is proof of the fact
[25:44] that like that that story jesus told
[25:47] about the sower that went forth and then
[25:49] another enemy went forth and sowed morsi
[25:52] there's evidence of that fact
[25:54] and when we look at what's happening
[25:55] around us
[25:58] it is it is it has gone absolutely crazy
[26:02] in in new zealand these and i don't know
[26:04] how things are here but in new zealand
[26:05] there's there's laws that's that's now
[26:07] being put into place where we it comes
[26:11] to a point where you're not even allowed
[26:13] to tell anyone they're a boy or a girl
[26:15] anymore
[26:16] you know
[26:17] it's gotten to that point how much how
[26:20] much sense does that make it doesn't
[26:22] even make logical sense but but
[26:24] everything has gone so haywire that
[26:26] people don't know where they are anymore
[26:28] i was saying you know every government
[26:30] form we felt fill in now is you know
[26:33] are you a male female or other
[26:36] i haven't met the other yet
[26:38] but
[26:39] but you see everything is going going
[26:41] crazy like that and what is that's the
[26:43] evidence of that other seed that went
[26:45] into the ground the evidence that they
[26:47] were perverted seed
[26:50] but at the same time we're not looking
[26:52] at the negative right at the same time
[26:54] the bride is being matured at the same
[26:56] time the bride is coming to her fullness
[26:58] and just like satan's eden is coming to
[27:00] maturity hallelujah we're living in that
[27:03] time where that former and later rain is
[27:05] coming together and and as the seeds are
[27:07] going into the ground the growth is real
[27:09] fast
[27:10] and just as much as all the perversion
[27:12] is going on and coming to maturity and
[27:14] really coming out of the closet so to
[27:16] speak and all sorts of rubbish i mean in
[27:18] the same way the word of god is bearing
[27:20] food fruit quickly now in this age
[27:23] because that that that that sowing rain
[27:25] and the harvest rain is coming together
[27:27] now hallelujah and and both sides are
[27:30] being prepared for a harvest
[27:33] hallelujah one tree one side is prepared
[27:35] to be burnt the other side is being
[27:37] prepared to reign with christ
[27:39] hallelujah so now brother branham
[27:42] preaches that message the spoken word is
[27:44] the original seed and he uses that same
[27:46] scripture reading that i use tonight
[27:49] and and in the broader scheme of things
[27:51] you know we can make the general
[27:53] statements and i will start with that
[27:55] but since the spoken word is the
[27:57] original seed the crop that's now being
[27:59] matured in the bride in this harvest
[28:02] time is the original word again the
[28:04] fruit is back to the original word again
[28:07] but the seed that went into the ground
[28:09] did not abide alone it did not stay
[28:11] singular i mean the seed went into the
[28:14] ground but it's bringing forth a whole
[28:15] crop
[28:16] hallelujah and now this crop that is
[28:18] being produced is a multiplication of
[28:20] that original seed or a further
[28:23] expression of the original seed
[28:26] but you see our god is a god of variety
[28:30] our god when he planted the garden of
[28:32] eden
[28:33] he planted a variety
[28:36] he made the earth with variety brother
[28:38] branham speaks about how he made
[28:39] mountains and streams and and grassy
[28:42] areas and bushy areas and god is a god
[28:45] of right variety god doesn't just make
[28:48] one thing and and this sort of a
[28:50] one-size-fits-all kind of approach
[28:53] guy didn't say
[28:54] let's be very efficient now now look let
[28:57] me let me put it this way if i had to
[28:59] design it i would have been you know i
[29:02] would have said well let's you know
[29:04] let's let's
[29:05] make it as efficient as we can
[29:08] so so let's you know instead of making
[29:10] all these different fruits and you have
[29:11] to travel all over the world and in this
[29:13] day import things from here and import
[29:15] things from there let's just make a
[29:16] fruit that is perfect you know let's
[29:18] let's just use an example as a blueberry
[29:20] right that people say blueberry is very
[29:23] healthy for you so let's use a blueberry
[29:25] but let's say we would have said let's
[29:27] take all the nicest flavors and put it
[29:30] together into this one little fruit
[29:32] and we would say all the minerals that
[29:34] you could ever need and all the vitamins
[29:36] you could ever need and all the benefits
[29:38] and everything let's put it together in
[29:40] this one fruit right and and and god
[29:42] planted the whole garden just full of
[29:44] this fruit and this is all we would have
[29:46] had
[29:47] now
[29:49] now you know god could have done that
[29:52] but that's not who god is
[29:54] that does not reflect who god is
[29:59] and god could have done that
[30:02] but
[30:03] and i wanted to say if we ate that fruit
[30:05] for the first time you're looking at me
[30:07] like where's he going this is crazy
[30:09] stuff just just be with me right
[30:12] but i want to say if we ate that fruit
[30:13] the first time
[30:15] it would have been amazing
[30:17] it would have blown us away
[30:19] it would have exploded on our ballot it
[30:22] would have you know the healing powers
[30:23] of it and so forth we would have really
[30:25] enjoyed it
[30:27] but you see mankind
[30:29] just like the children of israel over
[30:31] time
[30:32] we would say like they did our soul
[30:34] loathes us this light bread
[30:36] god gave them manna god gave them
[30:38] heavenly bread god gave them everything
[30:40] they needed it was so good for them that
[30:42] they didn't get sick nothing
[30:45] but they got to a point where they said
[30:47] our soul loatheth this light bread
[30:51] you see
[30:52] for our human even our human taste how
[30:55] boring would that get
[30:58] even how wonderful it would have been
[30:59] the most amazing fruit
[31:01] if you had that day in day out all you
[31:04] got
[31:05] it would get really boring
[31:09] now of course
[31:11] we know that there is a tree that has
[31:13] all the perfect properties
[31:16] and it was not one of the natural trees
[31:18] in the garden the bible says they were
[31:20] all the trees in the garden and the tree
[31:22] in the midst of the garden now that tree
[31:24] has all the properties we ever need
[31:26] right if we did take of that tree that's
[31:29] got all the vitamins that's got all the
[31:31] nutrition that we ever need spiritually
[31:33] speaking right and that's still that
[31:35] that tree still exists today
[31:38] and that tree of life is a person and
[31:40] that's the person that we should be in
[31:41] spiritual union with in this day
[31:43] hallelujah that tree of life
[31:46] and that's what we're speaking about
[31:48] tonight i mean that's what we should be
[31:50] speaking about every service
[31:51] him the tree of life our personal tree
[31:54] of life our relationship with him and so
[31:56] forth
[31:58] but when it comes to his creation
[32:00] god is a god of variety
[32:03] let's just put up that picture just to
[32:04] kind of reflect that thought
[32:06] god made sweet and sour
[32:09] god made big and small
[32:11] god made
[32:12] light and heavy round and oval and
[32:15] pear-shaped and all sorts of things
[32:17] straight and bent
[32:19] and in all those things god reflects his
[32:22] attribute that he is a god of variety
[32:26] and god knew that his children was going
[32:28] to one like a banana and the next one
[32:30] like a pear and the next one like a
[32:31] watermelon and so forth
[32:34] but you know it's also the same with
[32:36] sons and daughters of god
[32:39] god did not take a cookie cutter and
[32:40] make us all exactly the same
[32:44] all the attributes that were in god
[32:46] before the foundation of the world each
[32:48] one of them is different
[32:51] each one of them is unique
[32:53] each one of them reflects something
[32:56] about god
[32:59] in their own unique way
[33:01] and god has you know in our human
[33:03] expression god has short and tall and
[33:06] wide and thin
[33:08] and
[33:08] dark and light and everything in between
[33:12] god has all sorts of
[33:14] variations god is witty
[33:16] god is slow god is deep thinkers god is
[33:19] lighthearted
[33:20] guide us all those things and god has
[33:22] made us such
[33:24] but there's one thing that every son and
[33:27] daughter of god has in common and that
[33:29] is that we come from god and we will go
[33:32] back to god
[33:34] everyone as different as we are
[33:37] hallelujah we can look at one another
[33:38] and say i don't know how he can be a son
[33:41] of god i don't know how she can be a
[33:43] daughter of god because they're so
[33:44] different to me
[33:46] and of course because i look from my
[33:47] perspective you look so off
[33:50] so different so other right
[33:53] but from god's perspective you fit in in
[33:55] your spot and i fit in in my spot amen
[33:58] and god has designed it like that
[34:00] and we all come from god hallelujah and
[34:03] we want to go back to god and we all are
[34:06] unique
[34:07] we all have in this flesh a unique dna
[34:10] unique fingerprint and so forth
[34:15] this bride this many membered a bunch of
[34:18] eternal attributes of god if i can use
[34:20] that term as different as we are
[34:24] god is preparing us for a rapture
[34:26] god is preparing us for a body change
[34:29] i'll put it this way god is in this
[34:32] rapturing process working on us i mean
[34:36] to prepare us for that finality for that
[34:38] body change
[34:41] now each of us
[34:42] have have hopefully heard the shout and
[34:44] maybe there's some sitting you haven't
[34:46] heard that shout really internally yet
[34:48] but if you're an elected son or daughter
[34:51] of god you will hear it
[34:54] you will respond nothing can get can go
[34:57] against that right
[34:59] and if we now sitting under that
[35:01] or under the i want to say the anointing
[35:03] or in the phase or in the fold of the
[35:05] shout part uh sorry in the the voice
[35:08] part i mean where god is now working on
[35:10] us and i was fellowshipping with with
[35:12] brother chad it's like the main thought
[35:14] that i've been preaching on over the
[35:15] last few years because it's all about
[35:17] the voice it's all about where we are at
[35:19] now where god is getting preeminence in
[35:21] his church where god's word is getting
[35:23] preeminence in us where god is forming
[35:25] our character we god is building us up
[35:27] so that we can sit and reign with him on
[35:29] the throne so that he can take us home
[35:31] and place us as his queen on his throne
[35:34] and what we will need brothers and
[35:35] sisters i love that quote in the church
[35:37] age book where he says
[35:39] authority with character is
[35:42] sorry authority without character is
[35:44] satanic but authority with character is
[35:46] fit to rule
[35:48] god is preparing a bride who is fit to
[35:50] rule and god is doing it now under the
[35:52] voice part of the threefold purpose
[35:56] and all of that happens
[35:58] because we were part of him from before
[36:00] the foundation of the world
[36:02] and we are being restored back to him in
[36:04] this redemption process
[36:07] and that's the big picture that's what
[36:08] god does to the body as a whole and
[36:10] that's our purpose and that's our
[36:12] journey and that's our goal
[36:14] because it's god's goal
[36:16] and therefore it's our goal
[36:18] but for the bride as a body to mature
[36:21] god needs to mature each individual
[36:25] in that body
[36:27] but because every member of the body is
[36:29] unique
[36:30] the details of your and my individual
[36:34] maturing process may look just slightly
[36:36] different
[36:38] because god needs different ways to deal
[36:40] with each one of us based on how he made
[36:43] us
[36:44] so the maturing process you know it's so
[36:47] easy to look at how god is working with
[36:49] this one how god is working with that
[36:51] one
[36:51] and we can we can we can get uh uh uh
[36:55] this discomforted or something and look
[36:58] but god doesn't work with me like that
[37:00] or god doesn't use me like that or or
[37:02] god doesn't allow these things in my
[37:04] life or whatever it is we can get so
[37:06] uptight about all those things instead
[37:08] of saying god work with me
[37:10] god you know my makeup you know how me
[37:13] how you made me you know what you need
[37:14] to work on me you know what you need for
[37:16] me to be rapture ready hallelujah and it
[37:20] all works together for god's glory to
[37:23] come under god's threefold purpose but
[37:26] under that threefold purpose based on
[37:28] our different roles and placings and how
[37:30] god wants to use each one of us and what
[37:32] our makeup is
[37:34] it may look slightly different for each
[37:36] one of us and that's so important that's
[37:38] probably you know one of the one of the
[37:40] the questions that pastors face very
[37:43] often is
[37:45] why can't i be like that brother why
[37:47] can't i be like that sister and so forth
[37:49] and we struggle with things instead of
[37:51] just looking at god
[37:53] you know god is saying what is that to
[37:55] thee follow the army
[37:57] right
[37:58] it all works together for god's purpose
[38:01] i put it in these terms each stone in
[38:03] the temple of god
[38:06] has a different place in the body
[38:08] remember we are typed as the new
[38:10] jerusalem
[38:12] every stone in the new jerusalem every
[38:14] stone in the temple of god whatever
[38:16] terminology you want to use
[38:19] every stone is unique
[38:21] and every stone is chosen by god to be
[38:24] in that temple
[38:26] but each one of us have a different
[38:28] place in the temple
[38:30] and i'm not going to go down that road
[38:32] now but we can't take one another's
[38:34] place
[38:35] no one else will fit in the hole that
[38:39] god has made for you
[38:42] but at the same time you cannot fit in
[38:44] someone else's hole you might try
[38:47] and it will actually bring this
[38:49] disconnect in the body
[38:50] but god has a place for each one of us
[38:54] but here's the thing
[38:56] god might need slightly different tools
[38:58] for each one of us
[39:01] you see some some stones may be
[39:04] really close to what they should be
[39:07] and maybe for some stones god only need
[39:09] to use a bit of sandpaper and you know
[39:10] just shave off a little here and there
[39:13] but then there's some stones where god
[39:14] needs a bit of a you know hammer and a
[39:16] chisel and chisel some corners off and
[39:19] then there's some stones like me that he
[39:20] has to really get going on and he needs
[39:23] to but take a big hammer and get some
[39:25] you know a lot of nonsense off that
[39:27] stone in order to fit into that place
[39:29] that god had for me amen but god works
[39:32] differently with each one of us
[39:36] and god needs a very specific stone for
[39:39] a very specific purpose and each one of
[39:43] us brothers and sisters that's i want to
[39:44] encourage you you know i know sometimes
[39:47] when you come from this perspective it
[39:49] actually discourages people because
[39:50] people start thinking where do i fit and
[39:52] what is my role and poor me and i want
[39:54] to be this i want to be that
[39:56] i want to say let god show
[39:59] amen
[40:00] brother brahma speaks about how the gift
[40:01] will make place for itself
[40:03] right we don't have to worry about it
[40:06] let's just walk forward with god and god
[40:08] will do it right
[40:10] so now
[40:11] i just want to take brother branham as
[40:13] an example for for a moment
[40:16] and and and i trust you will see this in
[40:18] context now
[40:20] now god needed a very specific stone for
[40:23] a very specific and important job
[40:27] and that stone was lying in a weed pile
[40:30] somewhere
[40:32] that stone had a seventh grade education
[40:35] that stone was dirt poor
[40:37] he had no religious credentials his
[40:40] family had no religious credentials he
[40:42] was raised in the house of a drunkard
[40:45] he witnessed firsthand
[40:48] probably the worst of what that era
[40:50] could offer
[40:52] he saw you know he describes how he saw
[40:54] people breaking their marriage vows and
[40:56] you know bri lying around drunk and
[40:59] having to be sobered up to go home to
[41:01] cook their husbands a meal and stuff
[41:03] like that it's probably the worst
[41:05] excesses of that time
[41:07] god allowed that stone to grow up in
[41:09] that environment
[41:11] right because god had a purpose in it
[41:14] so god had to get going with his hammer
[41:16] and chisel
[41:17] and god had to give him some serious
[41:19] blows
[41:20] i remember growing up and mom would read
[41:23] us the stories of brother branham in
[41:25] what was those days just the footprint
[41:28] footprints in the sands of time book and
[41:30] we would cry and we would love the
[41:32] the life story and so forth
[41:35] but god had to really deal with with
[41:37] brother brennan
[41:38] god had to brother adam speaks about how
[41:40] he ran away and he wanted nothing to do
[41:42] with preachers he wanted nothing to do
[41:44] with it but yet on the inside god had
[41:46] been calling in him since he was a
[41:48] little boy
[41:50] and god was preparing him blow after
[41:52] blow after blow
[41:55] but god had his hand on that stone
[41:58] and at god's appointed time that stone
[42:00] was ready for service
[42:04] god has a vision for the temple and god
[42:06] has a vision where every stone would fit
[42:09] in
[42:10] but when we look at ourselves we can so
[42:13] easily miss god's perspective
[42:16] this doesn't want to flick over there we
[42:18] go
[42:22] it's so easy
[42:23] so easy for us just to look at the raw
[42:26] product
[42:28] instead of looking at what god wants to
[42:30] achieve
[42:31] it's so easy for us to just look at our
[42:33] humanity
[42:34] where that stone is looking in there is
[42:36] sitting in a weed pond
[42:38] you see when god looks at that heap of
[42:41] rubble god doesn't see a heap of rubble
[42:44] god sees every stone's potential and god
[42:48] sees that stone as he's going to use it
[42:50] in his war
[42:52] this is an expression when god looks at
[42:55] the heaps of heap of stones that's what
[42:56] he says for i know the thoughts that i
[42:59] think toward you what thoughts are is he
[43:01] thinking towards us god knows exactly
[43:03] where he wants to use you
[43:05] god knows exactly all about you
[43:08] and let me let you in on the secret god
[43:10] knew every mistake you were going to
[43:11] make
[43:12] and god knew how it was going to affect
[43:14] you
[43:15] and god knew what was he what he was
[43:17] going to achieve even through your
[43:18] mistakes
[43:19] because everything worked together for
[43:21] good
[43:23] amen for the elect not for everyone for
[43:25] the elect everything worked together for
[43:27] the good for us
[43:29] hallelujah god says for i know the
[43:31] thoughts that i think toward you saith
[43:32] the lord thoughts of peace and not of
[43:35] evil
[43:37] amen when you're on the weed pile god
[43:39] sees you to come to that expected end
[43:42] god sees you already from the
[43:44] perspective of the expected end god
[43:46] doesn't see you on the wheat pile in
[43:49] god's perspective you never on the wheat
[43:51] part god always looks at you as exactly
[43:54] how he's used he's gonna use you
[43:56] hallelujah
[43:58] god still sees what he saw before the
[44:00] foundation of the earth
[44:02] now we're speaking about the bride and
[44:04] we're speaking about getting rapture
[44:05] ready and how god is maturing every
[44:07] stone in the building now
[44:09] and and i'm just gonna for a moment use
[44:12] use the human body as an example again
[44:15] god is using every organ in the body
[44:19] and preparing us to work together i mean
[44:23] and every little blood vessel every
[44:25] little cell and whether you're the heart
[44:26] or the brain or the small finger or
[44:28] whatever little cell it is we all need
[44:30] to work together for one purpose
[44:34] and there's no big one or little one
[44:35] among us like i said earlier i mean god
[44:38] uses every bit to contribute everything
[44:40] that is needed for it all to work
[44:42] together as god wants us to
[44:44] every cell down to the smallest part
[44:48] and let me just shift the focus to jesus
[44:51] now as an example
[44:53] so i highlighted how the spoken word is
[44:55] the original seed
[44:57] i spoke about how god is a god of
[44:59] variety and so forth
[45:01] so
[45:02] maybe
[45:06] yeah let me let me speak about jesus
[45:07] first so now
[45:09] jesus i want to say that the flesh
[45:12] manifestation of jesus right
[45:15] was in god's mind and plan
[45:17] we know how the bible says that the lamb
[45:19] was slain before the foundation of the
[45:20] earth right jesus was that lamb
[45:23] jesus is that lamb he's not a past tense
[45:25] person right
[45:26] he is that lamb and god foresaw jesus as
[45:29] that lamb so the lamb of god jesus in
[45:32] flesh was in god's mind before the
[45:33] foundation of the earth
[45:35] was an attribute in god's mind
[45:38] that sonship that expression of god
[45:41] so the bible clearly state that the lamb
[45:44] was slain before the foundation of the
[45:45] earth
[45:47] so jesus the lamb of god the flesh
[45:49] expression of god
[45:51] i mean where god was going to express
[45:53] himself in human flesh
[45:55] was a thought or an attribute in elohim
[45:59] when he was the self-existing one
[46:01] dwelling by himself dwelling with his
[46:03] thoughts
[46:06] now let me read in john 1 1 you know
[46:09] these things very well in the beginning
[46:11] was
[46:12] the word and i put that that logos in
[46:14] there in the beginning was the logos
[46:17] and the logos was with god and the logos
[46:21] was god
[46:22] so what happened there there was i want
[46:24] to say there was an expression or the
[46:26] transformation
[46:28] where that thought that attribute now
[46:30] was expressed into a word form into a
[46:32] logos form so you have thought to word
[46:35] now
[46:36] and then then when god spoke it it was
[46:39] no longer just hidden in the mind of god
[46:41] now there was an expression of the mind
[46:43] of god
[46:45] and that word i believe was the logos or
[46:48] the theophany of god
[46:50] so now
[46:52] here's the thing
[46:53] when we speak about the word the word
[46:55] the word the word the word the word many
[46:57] times when we speak about the word
[46:58] people think about a book
[47:01] like this which in you know today like
[47:04] it comes in the form of ipads and phones
[47:06] and all sorts of things right
[47:09] but the word is a person
[47:11] the word is not you cannot contain the
[47:14] logos in a book like this
[47:16] you cannot contain the attributes of god
[47:19] on paper
[47:20] nothing the world cannot contain the
[47:22] whole like that song sees
[47:24] nothing can contain the logos of god
[47:27] because there's always more than what we
[47:29] can contain
[47:30] that's why we can never be a
[47:31] denomination
[47:33] because as soon as we draw our circle
[47:35] god just grows out of the circle right
[47:37] praise god
[47:38] so there's certainly more than what we
[47:40] can write down on paper
[47:42] yet god spoke many things about that
[47:45] lamb of god
[47:46] amen god spoke it through the prophets
[47:50] god prophesied in fact in the garden of
[47:53] eden god promised the seed of the woman
[47:55] right
[47:57] god spoke it in so many ways and he
[47:58] expressed himself
[48:01] he did not only do it through the
[48:02] prophets he did it through the psalms he
[48:04] did it through the lives of the
[48:05] patriarchs and so forth you know all
[48:07] those beautiful things that we can go
[48:09] into of joseph and different ones
[48:12] but when it was time for jesus to come
[48:15] on the scene
[48:16] there was an existing
[48:18] canon of of prophecy that was there that
[48:21] pointed directly to that attribute of
[48:24] god
[48:26] a whole old testament worth of
[48:28] prophecies and examples and types and
[48:30] shadows and and laws and feast days and
[48:35] all sorts of things that was promised
[48:37] that was looking forward to that
[48:38] attribute of god
[48:41] and it was written in mystery form
[48:43] it was hidden from the wise and prudent
[48:46] but revealed at exactly the right time
[48:48] to sons and daughters who could receive
[48:50] it
[48:52] and then in according
[48:54] in accordance to verse 14
[48:56] and the word the logos was made flesh
[49:00] and dwelt among us
[49:01] and what happened now that that thought
[49:04] that had become word was now going into
[49:06] flesh
[49:07] into flesh form so it was extended
[49:10] another step
[49:12] the word which was the word of prophecy
[49:14] which was the logos that was spoken by
[49:15] god in the beginning and expressed again
[49:17] through lives of of prophets and and the
[49:20] word of prophets and and all the
[49:22] patriarchs and all those things that was
[49:24] now expressed like that now became into
[49:26] a manifestation form and i want to say
[49:29] he was the son of man
[49:31] and it was the son of man in male 4
[49:34] it was the son of a man in ram form he
[49:37] was that he was that masterpiece that i
[49:40] want to say the male masterpiece of god
[49:42] that was expressed in that day
[49:45] hallelujah so what we have now the
[49:46] thought
[49:47] of the land that was going to be slain
[49:49] that was expressed as logos now became
[49:52] flesh
[49:56] now
[49:58] god lived through that flesh god
[50:01] accomplished everything in that flesh
[50:03] that he intended to do
[50:06] god accomplished through that flesh
[50:08] everything that was that was associated
[50:11] with that attribute
[50:14] right there in god's mind before the
[50:15] foundation of the earth
[50:17] you see god had intended for that
[50:19] attribute for that flesh expression of
[50:22] him
[50:23] to be born as a baby in a stable grow up
[50:27] be persecuted
[50:28] go through the whole process
[50:31] be hung on a cross
[50:33] give his life and be raised again and
[50:36] all of that was contained in the
[50:38] attribute of god in that thought of god
[50:40] and god knew all of that before there
[50:42] was an atom
[50:44] that was god's plan it was entrenched in
[50:46] god
[50:49] in other words we can say everything
[50:50] that the spoken word the original seed
[50:53] had intended for the jesus attribute to
[50:55] express and you know where i'm going
[50:57] with this right
[50:58] was accomplished in the life of jesus
[51:01] and there was no power on earth that
[51:03] could stop the thoughts of god from
[51:05] becoming manifest
[51:08] there is no power on earth that can stop
[51:11] any spoken word seed of god from coming
[51:14] to fruition
[51:15] and bringing forth the crop that god had
[51:17] in mind for that seed
[51:20] i'm going to move back to brother
[51:21] branham now for a moment so now
[51:23] you know we've used jesus as an example
[51:25] and i and and i trust you see this in
[51:28] context i'm not lifting the prophet up
[51:30] as a man but i'm using his as him as an
[51:32] example as our wave chief what he was in
[51:34] this day
[51:37] so now i want to say without a doubt and
[51:40] i know in some places they would crucify
[51:42] you for saying things like this but in
[51:44] the mind of god in the mind of that
[51:47] elohim
[51:48] the self-existing one hallelujah
[51:51] there was an attribute
[51:53] of an elijah ministry that would come to
[51:55] announce the second coming of the lord
[51:57] jesus
[51:59] i have no doubt in my mind about that
[52:02] and then
[52:03] god spoke that
[52:05] logos into existence and when god
[52:08] expressed his attributes in logos form
[52:12] i believe the theophany of brother
[52:15] branham was in that low gospel
[52:18] don't get nervous on me now
[52:21] brother branham's theophany and i'll put
[52:23] it this way i believe and i'll just
[52:25] state that up front so that we get the
[52:26] context now i believe the bride's
[52:29] theophanies as a whole
[52:31] was the female part of the logos of god
[52:34] brother rahm says the logos was god's
[52:36] theophany right
[52:38] and we were expressed there with him
[52:41] we were expressed we went from thought
[52:43] to word at the same time brothers and
[52:46] sisters when jesus christ went from
[52:49] thought to word
[52:50] when we read when we read
[52:53] john 1 i'm just going to go back to john
[52:55] 1 1. when we read john 1 1
[52:59] i believe it's not only speaking of the
[53:01] mail
[53:03] in the beginning was the word
[53:05] and i was part of that word
[53:08] and if i look at that through my
[53:09] humanity i cannot do that
[53:13] but if i look at it through the
[53:14] prophetic word through the manifestation
[53:16] of what god brought to us in this day
[53:18] through the revelation of what god
[53:19] brought us i can say amen
[53:22] lord i don't know how it works i don't
[53:23] know what you're gonna have to do to
[53:24] change this fallen flesh that's
[53:27] struggling and fighting and battling
[53:29] every day god but i know that i was
[53:31] there and when the bible says in the
[53:33] beginning was the word when it all
[53:35] started when the first movement happened
[53:37] with the when the first point that could
[53:39] be a point of reference for time to
[53:41] begin in the beginning
[53:44] god expressed you and me with jesus
[53:46] christ in word for
[53:48] hallelujah
[53:50] and that's when sons and gods started
[53:52] jumping for giant and shouting for joy i
[53:55] i don't understand all those things but
[53:57] i know it's real
[53:58] hallelujah
[54:00] so now
[54:02] god was thinking before the foundation
[54:04] of the word of that elijah prophet
[54:06] and then
[54:08] god
[54:09] created the whole canon of of prophecy
[54:12] again about that elijah prophet that
[54:15] would come
[54:18] and
[54:23] sorry i'm just gonna move down here a
[54:25] little bit
[54:27] just like eve was part of adam the bride
[54:31] was part of god
[54:32] and when god took out of god sorry out
[54:35] of adam and expressed eve
[54:38] it just reflected what god had already
[54:40] done to take out of himself
[54:43] i mean the bride
[54:45] and so forth the bride was absolutely
[54:47] part of that logos
[54:49] so now just to go back to brother
[54:50] branham there was a thought in god's
[54:52] mind and god started ex god expressed
[54:55] that in theophany form but that also
[54:58] then also through the through the
[54:59] prophets and over time god released
[55:01] little tidbits little prophecies
[55:05] different things about this elijah of
[55:07] the end time and we know malachi 4 and
[55:10] you know we know revelations 3 of the
[55:12] letter to the church of laodicea right
[55:14] and so forth
[55:15] and
[55:15] the bible also recalls how that angel
[55:18] that showed john around you know and
[55:20] showed him the book of revelation showed
[55:22] him the the great and different
[55:24] things and
[55:26] you know how he would cry come out of
[55:27] him my people be not partakers of her
[55:29] sin and so forth
[55:31] and we read how i believe that was
[55:33] brother branham and i and we read in the
[55:35] bible how john wanted to worship him and
[55:37] he bowed down and he wanted to worship
[55:38] him and he said don't do it i mean i'm
[55:41] of you of your fellow servants the
[55:42] prophets and so forth
[55:44] [Music]
[55:45] and then we move on and we see in
[55:48] revelations 10
[55:49] i mean how that heavenly angel comes
[55:51] down to that
[55:52] same person
[55:54] hallelujah and he clears with a loud
[55:56] voice and gives him the book and he
[55:58] breaks the seals and and releases it to
[56:01] us and the thunders go forth and so
[56:03] forth
[56:04] so at god's appointed time and season
[56:08] all those prophecies
[56:10] now went from
[56:12] thought
[56:13] in elohim
[56:15] to theophany
[56:18] to flesh
[56:20] now we know the prophet says it it was
[56:22] different for us than it was for jesus
[56:24] he went directly from attribute to
[56:26] thought to flesh and i can't explain all
[56:28] the all the technicalities in the in the
[56:30] ma in the the manifestation of that
[56:33] but very clearly the prophet speaks
[56:35] about how adam was in his theophany
[56:38] and and so forth and and we we came like
[56:42] adam came
[56:44] and
[56:45] brother branham now when he came on the
[56:47] earth
[56:48] now now
[56:50] please forgive me for do this for doing
[56:52] this i trust no one's got a problem with
[56:53] that but i'm going to say when jesus
[56:56] came in a flesh expression
[56:59] he came in a stinking stable as a little
[57:02] baby
[57:03] out of a woman that came from nazareth
[57:06] and so forth
[57:07] to the extent where everyone knew how
[57:09] bad nazareth was and i think it was
[57:11] nathanael that said could anything good
[57:13] come out of nazareth
[57:16] we can say in this day again and i'm not
[57:17] lifting up brother branham to the level
[57:19] of jesus christ don't get me wrong but
[57:21] we can say in this in this day and age
[57:23] can everything good come out of the
[57:24] backwoods of kentucky out of a drunk
[57:26] man's home
[57:28] hallelujah but yes
[57:30] because the goodness was not in the
[57:31] flesh expression the goodness comes from
[57:33] the seed of god
[57:35] hallelujah just like for you and me no
[57:37] matter what circumstances we grew up in
[57:39] no matter what affected us no matter
[57:42] how much we our lives were messed up but
[57:45] when that rebirth comes brothers and
[57:47] sisters it lifts us up to a higher
[57:49] reality that has nothing to do with that
[57:52] old flesh yet the paradox is god can use
[57:56] our circumstances to form that stone so
[57:58] that we are ready for him to use
[58:02] i want to encourage you with that
[58:06] so we can say again
[58:08] that the word
[58:10] became flesh
[58:11] and dwelt among us
[58:13] don't go too far with it
[58:16] but we can say again the word
[58:19] became flesh the word that said that we
[58:21] there would be a malachi 4 5 prophet the
[58:24] word that spoke about the seventh angel
[58:26] the word that said that revelations 10
[58:29] the angel came down that word
[58:31] became flesh
[58:33] in the life of william branham
[58:37] and i'm going to say again
[58:38] the word that god had in his mind from
[58:40] before the foundation of the earth
[58:44] hallelujah
[58:49] now i want to look at the bride now
[58:52] because that was the wave sheath
[58:54] and i know you know exactly where i'm
[58:56] going so you can relax and i can relax
[58:58] right
[58:59] so now let's look at the bride as a
[59:01] whole
[59:02] and we can do exactly the same as what
[59:04] we did with brother
[59:06] we see how elohim
[59:08] had us in mind
[59:10] and now we were part of his logos
[59:13] or word or theophany
[59:16] and how he spoke
[59:18] through his prophets
[59:20] about the bride
[59:22] and now he spoke through the examples in
[59:24] the bible we read about joshua and caleb
[59:27] we read about rebecca we read about
[59:30] tamar
[59:31] elisha following elijah hallelujah we
[59:35] have we have
[59:36] a canon of prophecy that's looking at
[59:38] the bride hallelujah
[59:40] so there's prophecy lying there there
[59:42] was thought in god's mind attribute in
[59:44] god's mind god expressed it in logos
[59:46] form and god expressed it through his
[59:48] prophets god
[59:49] expressed it as prophecy
[59:51] but there is a point at which that
[59:52] prophecy is being fulfilled
[59:54] and of course we know that the bride it
[59:56] was expressed over seven church ages and
[59:58] so forth and we know that in that last
[1:00:01] time when the rapture
[1:00:03] rapturing processes is on the go and we
[1:00:05] where god is wrapping it all up and
[1:00:07] getting us all ready
[1:00:09] so now
[1:00:10] the bible speaks of to us and say
[1:00:12] directly i send you elijah the prophet
[1:00:15] even in that scripture you and i
[1:00:17] are there and and i want to say there's
[1:00:20] something profound about that
[1:00:23] because before the foundation of the
[1:00:24] earth when elohim was thinking of your
[1:00:26] attribute my attribute
[1:00:28] he was also associating our attribute
[1:00:30] with the messenger he was going to use
[1:00:32] to carry that message to you and me
[1:00:35] hallelujah and god associated us with
[1:00:37] that and god knew then
[1:00:39] right that he was going to bring us in
[1:00:41] this age and that god was going to
[1:00:43] quicken us under this eagle anointing
[1:00:45] and bring us up in this age where he's
[1:00:48] going to prepare us to take a rapture to
[1:00:50] take a body change god did not intend
[1:00:52] for us to come under luther's ministry
[1:00:53] god had not intended us to come under
[1:00:55] wesley's ministry but if god had then we
[1:00:58] would have been bright for that age if
[1:01:00] we were in god's mind
[1:01:01] but you and i were associated with this
[1:01:03] ministry in this age
[1:01:05] and i want to say i thank god for it
[1:01:08] it's probably from a mental pressure
[1:01:10] perspective the hardest age to to live
[1:01:13] in but it's also the most wonderful age
[1:01:16] because we are so privileged with how
[1:01:18] much word god has made available
[1:01:21] so when we look at these things as the
[1:01:23] body of the bride as a whole
[1:01:26] it has gone again from attribute to
[1:01:28] thought
[1:01:30] or sorry from attribute or thought to
[1:01:32] word or logos or theophany and then to
[1:01:35] flesh
[1:01:37] now
[1:01:38] i'm just going to read a quote there
[1:01:39] about that eagle story i love that eagle
[1:01:41] story loved it since i was a kid
[1:01:44] brother ram says here and he would hear
[1:01:45] that hen cluck
[1:01:47] he would try his best to cluck but he
[1:01:49] couldn't do it he tried to cheap like a
[1:01:52] chicken but he could not do it
[1:01:54] see he was an eagle he to start with
[1:01:58] was an ego
[1:01:59] he was just hatched out under a hand
[1:02:02] just like all of us
[1:02:04] right
[1:02:04] but there was something in us from
[1:02:07] not just the start from from forever and
[1:02:09] forever and forever hallelujah that was
[1:02:12] going to be an eagle
[1:02:15] and one day his mommy flew over and she
[1:02:17] screamed he recognized it
[1:02:20] why
[1:02:22] because he heard it before just in
[1:02:23] another form hallelujah amen praise god
[1:02:27] that sounded right why he was an eagle
[1:02:32] to begin with
[1:02:33] he was always an eagle god always saw
[1:02:36] him or her as an eagle
[1:02:39] that's the way it is with the gospel or
[1:02:40] the word or the power of jesus christ
[1:02:42] when a man has been predestinated to
[1:02:44] eternal life in other words you were in
[1:02:46] the mind of god he hears that true ring
[1:02:49] scream of god nothing can keep him from
[1:02:52] it because how can you change the
[1:02:54] thoughts that were in god's mind
[1:02:56] the old mammy said son jump you're an
[1:02:58] eagle come up here where i am he said
[1:03:00] mom i never jumped in my life
[1:03:03] and she's saying what's that got to do
[1:03:04] with it right she said well you jump
[1:03:07] you're an eagle to begin with you're not
[1:03:09] a chicken
[1:03:10] i mean
[1:03:12] but mommy i'm finding myself among the
[1:03:14] chickens in the barnyard and they all
[1:03:15] want to eat all this uh you know scraps
[1:03:18] on the floor and mommy says
[1:03:20] yes i know you haven't experienced
[1:03:22] anything else but you're you're eager
[1:03:25] you're not a chicken although you might
[1:03:26] have scratched around with them in the
[1:03:28] barnyard you are not a chicken
[1:03:31] hallelujah so he made his first jump and
[1:03:33] flopped his wings didn't do too good
[1:03:37] but he got off the ground
[1:03:39] hallelujah
[1:03:41] he says that's the way we do we accept
[1:03:43] god by faith by the written word there
[1:03:45] is something in there it's that eternal
[1:03:48] life you were predestinated to it
[1:03:52] you have been formed into the living
[1:03:54] image of the living god
[1:03:56] you heard from your theophany
[1:03:58] hallelujah
[1:04:00] we heard
[1:04:02] from the expression of the thought that
[1:04:04] was in god's mind
[1:04:07] hallelujah
[1:04:10] so now
[1:04:13] what gets us out of our condition
[1:04:15] is when we hear from alfie offer
[1:04:18] when we hear from our word
[1:04:19] representation
[1:04:21] and when we recognize
[1:04:24] who we are
[1:04:25] when we recognize i'm an eagle to begin
[1:04:28] with
[1:04:29] in other words i was part at what was
[1:04:32] prophesied for this age as the bride of
[1:04:35] christ
[1:04:38] in fact the mere fact that i have a
[1:04:39] theophany hallelujah proves that i was
[1:04:43] in the mind of god hallelujah because
[1:04:45] god doesn't express anything other than
[1:04:48] his attributes and his thoughts in word
[1:04:50] form in that logos form
[1:04:53] so now that partly takes us to my title
[1:04:55] tonight i'll just remind you of my title
[1:04:57] the spoken word in each fruit
[1:05:00] so let's continue and just develop that
[1:05:02] thought a little further
[1:05:05] but from god's principle every seed
[1:05:08] brings forth of its kind remember we
[1:05:10] started off with that
[1:05:12] and the original spoken word seed brings
[1:05:14] forth spoken word fruit
[1:05:17] now let's take it a little further
[1:05:19] i want to make it a little more
[1:05:20] practical and tangible by god's help
[1:05:22] tonight
[1:05:24] so now
[1:05:27] i want to look
[1:05:29] at at it more practically and bring it
[1:05:32] more individual than group
[1:05:37] now i'll ask you this
[1:05:40] when you were that thought in god's mind
[1:05:43] before the logos was expressed
[1:05:46] what
[1:05:48] did god think about you
[1:05:52] what were god's thoughts about you
[1:05:54] remember we read that scripture in
[1:05:55] jeremiah where it says i know the
[1:05:57] thoughts i think about you right
[1:05:59] what were god's thoughts about you
[1:06:01] in fact what was the expected end that
[1:06:04] god was thinking about about you right
[1:06:08] maybe i should ask it this way how much
[1:06:10] did god know about you
[1:06:18] we can say it this way
[1:06:19] god took a picture of you
[1:06:22] and put it in his family album
[1:06:24] before the foundation of the world
[1:06:27] but when god took that picture he did
[1:06:29] not took he did not take that picture of
[1:06:32] when you were at your lowest
[1:06:34] when you had made a mess of mess of your
[1:06:36] life and so forth
[1:06:38] god took that picture when you are in
[1:06:40] your prime
[1:06:42] god took that picture of we saw you
[1:06:45] right at the end
[1:06:47] we saw you back in eternity
[1:06:50] that picture that god took of you is a
[1:06:52] perfect picture of you
[1:06:54] and our problem is as humans we
[1:06:56] constantly look at this picture
[1:06:58] this fallen flesh
[1:07:01] but even while we're looking at this
[1:07:02] fallen flesh god is still looking i mean
[1:07:05] god doesn't need to do this i'm just
[1:07:07] dramatizing just to prove the point
[1:07:09] right but when we mess up so much
[1:07:12] and god would look over the banister and
[1:07:13] see that now remember he doesn't see
[1:07:15] that because he looks looks at us
[1:07:17] through the blood but just to
[1:07:18] demonstrate right god can go to that
[1:07:20] family album
[1:07:21] ah my boy
[1:07:23] my girl he's perfect
[1:07:26] and at the same time we think i'm such a
[1:07:28] mess i've messed up my life in god's
[1:07:30] perspective he's thinking of you as your
[1:07:32] expected end hallelujah god's not
[1:07:36] thinking of us in a fallen state
[1:07:38] come on the omnipotent god that knows
[1:07:40] everything
[1:07:42] that's a paradox that's wonderful i mean
[1:07:46] it's looking at us thinking of us as
[1:07:48] we're going to be when every every bit
[1:07:51] of wrong has been taken away when we
[1:07:54] when we're rid of this flesh eventually
[1:07:56] and all our human attributes and
[1:07:58] humanistic stuff
[1:08:00] so now i want to make this point when
[1:08:02] god looks at us
[1:08:05] on his family photo now now this is not
[1:08:07] a perfect family photo right but just to
[1:08:10] demonstrate the point
[1:08:12] what does god see about each of his
[1:08:14] offspring
[1:08:18] now remember i said in god's family
[1:08:19] photo we all happy we in the prime of
[1:08:21] youth we perfect like this is not the
[1:08:23] case
[1:08:25] but
[1:08:26] what is what is pertinent in a family
[1:08:28] photo
[1:08:30] i mean what's the first thing we do when
[1:08:31] you look at a family photo oh there's
[1:08:33] uncle so and so and there's auntie
[1:08:34] so-and-so and this cousin this and this
[1:08:36] grandma so and so
[1:08:38] right
[1:08:40] and that's the point i want to make god
[1:08:42] looks at us each individually and part
[1:08:46] of what he sees of us is our place in
[1:08:48] the family
[1:08:50] our place in the body
[1:08:53] part of that expected end that god is
[1:08:55] looking at for each one of us is exactly
[1:08:58] where we fit
[1:09:00] the people that we're going to be in
[1:09:01] contact with
[1:09:02] the people that we're going to affect
[1:09:04] and of course remember i said it's
[1:09:06] against the background of the gifts the
[1:09:08] people that god is going to touch
[1:09:10] through our gifts and each one of us are
[1:09:12] gifted in in multiple ways
[1:09:15] the people that god was going to affect
[1:09:16] through our gifts
[1:09:18] the messenger of the age that god was
[1:09:20] going to place us under the pastor the
[1:09:22] ministry that god was going to place us
[1:09:24] under all those things is associated
[1:09:26] with us because god places us in a
[1:09:28] specific place in his family photo
[1:09:32] god saw you from the start or from
[1:09:33] before the start as part of the family
[1:09:36] and god saw where you fitted in the
[1:09:38] family
[1:09:40] so to answer the question god knows
[1:09:42] everything about you
[1:09:46] yet
[1:09:47] when you confess your sin he doesn't
[1:09:48] know that part i love that right i can
[1:09:50] never get enough of that
[1:09:52] but the omniscient god knows everything
[1:09:55] and he knew everything about each one of
[1:09:57] us
[1:09:58] and god never learns anything new
[1:10:02] when we were in god's mind as an
[1:10:03] attribute he knew exactly where we were
[1:10:06] going to fit in his kingdom
[1:10:08] every role
[1:10:10] every office
[1:10:12] every calling and now i want you to to
[1:10:14] make this real practical i'm not
[1:10:16] speaking about just ministry and deacons
[1:10:18] and so forth right i want you to think
[1:10:20] of yourself in your role as as a father
[1:10:22] as a mother as a brother as a sister as
[1:10:25] a family member
[1:10:26] all of us have roles to fulfill in this
[1:10:29] body of christ right
[1:10:31] and every gift that god would place in
[1:10:33] you
[1:10:34] for your earthly journey god's thought
[1:10:36] about that because it's associated with
[1:10:38] the attribute and it's something that
[1:10:40] god wanted to manifest to bless his body
[1:10:43] with
[1:10:46] so now
[1:10:47] i i just want to throw this in for a
[1:10:49] moment it looks like
[1:10:52] the gift that god places us
[1:10:55] in earth on
[1:10:56] still is maintained when we change and
[1:10:59] and and the reason why i'm saying that
[1:11:01] and i'm not saying necessarily all the
[1:11:02] gifts i don't know all of those things
[1:11:04] but but i'll just use two examples in
[1:11:06] the old testament
[1:11:08] remember when saul called up samuel
[1:11:10] he still had his prophet clothes on and
[1:11:12] so forth
[1:11:14] and in our day brother branham when he
[1:11:15] went beyond the curtain of time they
[1:11:17] said you were a leader on earth you'll
[1:11:18] be a leader here and so forth
[1:11:20] god still
[1:11:22] acknowledges the blessings that he has
[1:11:25] on the other side
[1:11:27] so
[1:11:28] the point i'm making is god knew of
[1:11:30] every role every responsibility every
[1:11:33] gift that he was going to use you and me
[1:11:36] in
[1:11:38] but here's what i want to get you and
[1:11:40] this is just glorious and wonderful and
[1:11:42] i trust that god can give me grace to
[1:11:43] express it as much as i enjoy it
[1:11:48] if god's thoughts about you included the
[1:11:51] gifts and the callings that he
[1:11:52] predestinated you for
[1:11:54] and god expressed those
[1:11:57] those thoughts of you in me in logos
[1:12:00] form or in theophany form
[1:12:03] now stay with me
[1:12:05] it means
[1:12:07] that your theophany
[1:12:09] contains the dna
[1:12:12] contains the application
[1:12:14] carries the vitamins and the life
[1:12:17] for everything that you would need in
[1:12:18] the roles in your life
[1:12:21] for every role for every gift for every
[1:12:24] calling
[1:12:27] now i want to just bring it back to
[1:12:28] simple terms so that the youngest ones
[1:12:30] among us can relate to this
[1:12:33] god's thoughts
[1:12:35] about you
[1:12:37] became god's word
[1:12:39] about you
[1:12:42] that was your theophany
[1:12:45] and your spoken word
[1:12:47] or your part of the logos or your
[1:12:50] theophany
[1:12:53] your little part of god
[1:12:55] is what you hear from today
[1:12:58] and it's quickened by the holy spirit in
[1:13:00] your soul and brings forth fruit and the
[1:13:04] fruit that you and i bring forth is a
[1:13:06] result of what was captured in god's
[1:13:09] mind and expressed in theophany form
[1:13:12] then that original seed brings
[1:13:15] manifestation brings fruit of what was
[1:13:17] in god's mind about you
[1:13:19] regarding every placing and calling that
[1:13:21] god has for you
[1:13:24] so now really this is
[1:13:26] back to the title the spoken word in
[1:13:28] each fruit
[1:13:30] and the point i want to make is
[1:13:32] when we speak about the spoken word is
[1:13:34] the original seed amen when we speak
[1:13:36] about the spoken word
[1:13:38] for jesus being the original seed for
[1:13:41] him amen when we spoke about the spoken
[1:13:44] word for brother branham was the
[1:13:45] original seed for him amen
[1:13:47] but i want to say there's a spoken word
[1:13:50] for you
[1:13:52] there's your theophany part there's your
[1:13:55] spoken word part
[1:13:56] and that spirit spoken word i mean that
[1:13:59] is the original seed that went into the
[1:14:01] ground
[1:14:02] and that is the birth that wants to that
[1:14:04] god wants to see manifested here and god
[1:14:06] is god is the the husbandman god is the
[1:14:09] one that oversees that seed to bring it
[1:14:12] to the fruition i mean of what god had
[1:14:14] in his mind the result of god's thoughts
[1:14:18] but what i want to stress tonight is
[1:14:20] it's not just a group thing you see we
[1:14:22] can look at these things as the group as
[1:14:25] the bride as a whole but this very
[1:14:26] individual
[1:14:28] god thinks thoughts about each one
[1:14:31] and god wants to bring each one of us to
[1:14:34] the thoughts that he thought about us
[1:14:36] and the thoughts that god had of us
[1:14:39] brings us to the expected end that god
[1:14:41] has for us
[1:14:44] so we'll say it again god can rest in
[1:14:46] the fact or we can rest in the fact that
[1:14:48] our theophany contains everything god
[1:14:51] thought about us
[1:14:53] and you and i can draw from that when we
[1:14:55] hear from our theophany
[1:14:57] hallelujah and we can draw from that for
[1:15:00] every aspect of our lives that has
[1:15:02] eternal value
[1:15:04] the spoken word the original seed is
[1:15:06] living through us
[1:15:08] and is the inspiration and driving force
[1:15:10] behind our lives
[1:15:14] i want to go back to that quote about
[1:15:15] the eagle now
[1:15:17] but i just want to highlight the context
[1:15:19] a little bit
[1:15:21] brother ram says says the specific time
[1:15:24] in who is this melchizedek
[1:15:26] now the whole theme of that message was
[1:15:29] that god is here right
[1:15:31] that the son of man has returned again
[1:15:35] i mean that was the whole theme of it
[1:15:37] and the whole the whole point was you
[1:15:39] know brother ram turned around and and
[1:15:40] demonstrated and did the sign of the
[1:15:42] messiah to show not that william branham
[1:15:45] is something special
[1:15:47] i mean god was demonstrating he was
[1:15:49] expressing himself through a vessel but
[1:15:51] god was on the scene again
[1:15:53] i mean and god was identifying the son
[1:15:56] of man is back
[1:15:57] and when the son of man is back
[1:15:59] hallelujah he doesn't leave again until
[1:16:02] he leaves with his bride
[1:16:03] amen so that son of man said through a
[1:16:06] son of man in the in the 50s and in the
[1:16:09] sea or in the 60s i mean he could say
[1:16:12] who is this melchizedek
[1:16:15] but you and i can say in this day who is
[1:16:17] this melchizedek
[1:16:20] who is this one that's in me
[1:16:22] amen you see
[1:16:25] he expressed i'll ride this trail once
[1:16:27] more
[1:16:28] he's not going to bring a return
[1:16:30] ministry in terms of brother branham a
[1:16:32] return ministry
[1:16:34] but there is and forgive me i'm just
[1:16:36] saying this just as a comment there is a
[1:16:39] return ministry
[1:16:41] but but it's the same son of man that
[1:16:42] went into the ground that's returned now
[1:16:44] in bright form i mean that's what's
[1:16:46] returned the son of man has returned not
[1:16:48] in flesh form or in jesus's flesh form
[1:16:51] in our flesh hallelujah he's expressed
[1:16:54] he's expressing himself i mean he is
[1:16:56] riding this trail once more i mean we're
[1:16:58] not waiting for another eight messenger
[1:17:00] we're not waiting for brother brown to
[1:17:02] return again he had his time god used
[1:17:04] that vessel god brought him to his
[1:17:07] expected end alleluia but god wants to
[1:17:09] bring you and me to our expected end and
[1:17:11] god doesn't expect it and for you and
[1:17:13] god has gotten expected in for me and
[1:17:15] each one of us might look slightly
[1:17:17] different
[1:17:18] and what god brings us to might look
[1:17:19] slightly different because we're
[1:17:21] different stones in the in in the temple
[1:17:23] we're different parts in the body we're
[1:17:25] different fruits because god is a god of
[1:17:27] variety i mean he's not a cookie cutter
[1:17:29] god but the point is god is going to
[1:17:31] reflect what he had in his mind for you
[1:17:34] god is going to reflect what he had in
[1:17:36] his mind for me
[1:17:38] and as i said at the start i don't know
[1:17:39] how he's going to do it because i am so
[1:17:42] unworthy
[1:17:43] but he's gonna do it because he said it
[1:17:45] and there's nothing that can stop that
[1:17:46] word
[1:17:47] and i thank god and that's the thing i'm
[1:17:50] more thankful for for anything
[1:17:52] and although i can't explain it i just
[1:17:54] say thank you jesus
[1:17:56] hallelujah
[1:17:58] the things that were written about us
[1:18:01] god will bring it to pass
[1:18:04] amen
[1:18:05] but why does god do it
[1:18:08] god wants to give us a confidence
[1:18:12] in him
[1:18:14] a confidence in what he said about us
[1:18:17] a confidence in the prophecy and word
[1:18:19] about us
[1:18:21] but brother and sister and really this
[1:18:23] is my focus tonight
[1:18:25] it's so easy to hide in the group
[1:18:28] to have group faith
[1:18:30] yes we all as a bride is going to get to
[1:18:32] that
[1:18:33] but we need to come to individual
[1:18:35] revelation
[1:18:36] i am part of this bride
[1:18:39] and i'm not just a part of the bride i'm
[1:18:40] a specific part of the bride
[1:18:43] because god has specific thoughts about
[1:18:46] me
[1:18:47] god has specific things he intended for
[1:18:49] me
[1:18:50] and it takes all that guessing away
[1:18:53] hallelujah we can have confidence in
[1:18:55] what god see
[1:18:57] we can have confidence in what god is
[1:18:59] doing in us
[1:19:01] because he is bringing us to an expected
[1:19:03] end not our effort
[1:19:05] not our sincerity not our dedication
[1:19:07] enough we need all those things don't
[1:19:09] get me wrong but god is going to bring
[1:19:11] us in fact god is bringing us under this
[1:19:14] voice part of the rapturing process god
[1:19:16] is bringing us to our expectation god is
[1:19:19] forming us into what he saw in his mind
[1:19:22] before the foundation of the world
[1:19:23] hallelujah
[1:19:26] i want to make more one more comment on
[1:19:27] on dna
[1:19:29] before i move on now i want to say this
[1:19:31] i don't know too much of dna so you know
[1:19:33] if you know more please forgive me in my
[1:19:36] ignorance but
[1:19:37] my understanding is this
[1:19:39] that every cell in our bodies contains
[1:19:42] all the dna information
[1:19:44] to bring forth this body
[1:19:47] but what happens
[1:19:50] is that depending on where that specific
[1:19:53] cell will be used
[1:19:56] a part of that dna is anointed to bring
[1:19:59] forth
[1:20:00] a liver cell
[1:20:02] and another part of their dna is
[1:20:04] anointed to bring forth a brain cell a
[1:20:07] blood vessel or whatever
[1:20:10] isn't that wonderful
[1:20:11] amen
[1:20:13] every son and every daughter of god
[1:20:15] contains the whole dna of god you know
[1:20:18] in in potential form but god anoints a
[1:20:22] specific little part
[1:20:24] i'll just put it this way i trust god
[1:20:26] will make it alive to you but
[1:20:28] god had a thought that was expressed
[1:20:30] that thought was expressed in the logos
[1:20:32] the word form that original seed form
[1:20:35] hallelujah
[1:20:36] and that
[1:20:37] and and each one of our parts god
[1:20:40] anoints that little part of his thought
[1:20:43] and expresses it through you
[1:20:46] but in every son and daughter of god is
[1:20:48] the whole dna of god available but
[1:20:51] he anoints our little part
[1:20:53] to bring us to an expected end
[1:20:56] to bring us to the bit that he wanted to
[1:20:58] use us for in the temple in the body of
[1:21:00] god
[1:21:02] that's just wonderful
[1:21:05] that's god's life god's zoe life in the
[1:21:08] bride
[1:21:10] but god doesn't express through my
[1:21:12] myself
[1:21:14] brother chad's
[1:21:16] predestinated path
[1:21:18] god anoints me to bring forth my part
[1:21:21] god expresses in me
[1:21:23] the placing the gift
[1:21:26] the
[1:21:27] all the things that god wants to do
[1:21:29] through me and he achieves through me
[1:21:31] what he wants to do through me
[1:21:33] and that's all by his predestination and
[1:21:36] that intelligence
[1:21:38] is in the logos
[1:21:40] in our
[1:21:41] is expressed through there
[1:21:43] and only god anoints the path that you
[1:21:45] and i need individually
[1:21:50] i want to look at it from another angle
[1:21:51] just to clench the nail a little more
[1:21:55] earlier i referred to how
[1:21:58] brother branham was that angel
[1:22:02] that showed john around and so forth
[1:22:05] i just want to look at that quickly in
[1:22:06] the word
[1:22:13] i'm just gonna
[1:22:15] quickly skip over some of this
[1:22:22] in fact let's just look at this one yes
[1:22:25] revelations 19
[1:22:27] the bible says and i fell at his feet to
[1:22:29] worship him and he said unto me see thou
[1:22:32] do it not i am thy fellow servant and of
[1:22:34] thy brethren they have the testimony of
[1:22:36] jesus he says worship god
[1:22:38] for the testimony of jesus is the spirit
[1:22:41] of prophecy
[1:22:44] brother braham says in the church book
[1:22:45] he says the spirit in paul which spirit
[1:22:48] is the spirit of christ for that is the
[1:22:51] spirit of prophecy whereby the word
[1:22:53] comes
[1:22:54] sees he sat down at the right hand of
[1:22:56] god
[1:22:57] now i believe that angel was brother
[1:22:59] branham like i said and i believe that
[1:23:01] john wanted to fall down and worship him
[1:23:04] he said to john in other words don't
[1:23:05] worship the vessel john
[1:23:07] don't worship the flesh john
[1:23:10] it's christ in me the hope of glory
[1:23:12] christ living behind this flesh
[1:23:14] and the spirit of christ in me is only
[1:23:16] expressing himself through this
[1:23:18] particular gift i'm just part of that
[1:23:21] body but don't glorify the vessel or
[1:23:24] glorify the gift but give the glory to
[1:23:26] god
[1:23:28] now i just want to use look at that
[1:23:30] wording the bible says the testimony of
[1:23:32] jesus christ brother brown refers to
[1:23:34] that the testimony of jesus christ is
[1:23:36] the spirit of prophecy
[1:23:38] that word testimony means it's a witness
[1:23:42] it's an evidence
[1:23:43] it's to like to testify in front of a
[1:23:45] judge
[1:23:47] in other words an evidence of what
[1:23:51] hallelujah it's the evidence that christ
[1:23:54] is on the scene
[1:23:57] the testimony of jesus
[1:23:59] is the evidence that jesus is on the
[1:24:02] scene but in a different form
[1:24:04] hallelujah
[1:24:05] i love that so brother branham was
[1:24:07] saying to the bride don't worship me
[1:24:09] remember john represents the bride don't
[1:24:11] worship william branham
[1:24:14] hallelujah but he's saying but the fact
[1:24:16] that i am here shows it's the evidence
[1:24:19] it's a representation that melchizedek
[1:24:21] is back it's a representation that
[1:24:23] christ is here again
[1:24:25] hallelujah
[1:24:28] now let's just look at
[1:24:31] uh just to emphasize this i want to use
[1:24:33] look at at verses in the bible where
[1:24:35] that used that word testimony is also
[1:24:38] used
[1:24:39] we see about john the baptist
[1:24:44] there was a man sent from god whose name
[1:24:46] was john
[1:24:47] the same came forth for a witness
[1:24:51] for an expression for a testimony of god
[1:24:55] the word was displayed through john and
[1:24:57] so forth jesus says to nicodemus jesus
[1:25:00] answered and said unto him are thou
[1:25:02] master of israel and know us not these
[1:25:03] things verily verily i say unto you we
[1:25:05] speak but that we do know and testify
[1:25:08] that we have seen and you receive not
[1:25:10] our testimony our witness our evidence
[1:25:13] there was the evidence amen of john 1 1
[1:25:16] and john 1 14. the evidence was sitting
[1:25:19] in front of nicodemus
[1:25:21] hallelujah but he said you don't receive
[1:25:23] our evidence
[1:25:25] this bride can say to the world today
[1:25:27] hallelujah
[1:25:29] we are the testimony
[1:25:31] we are the witness we are the evidence
[1:25:33] that melchizedek is back we are the
[1:25:35] evidence that the son of man is back
[1:25:37] hallelujah when that word is expressed
[1:25:40] through us but you don't receive our
[1:25:42] testimony our evidence
[1:25:44] jesus said to the jews who wanted to
[1:25:46] kill him
[1:25:47] if i bear witness of myself and my
[1:25:50] witness my testimony my evidence is not
[1:25:53] true there is another that beareth
[1:25:54] witness of me and i know that the
[1:25:56] witness which he witnesses of me is true
[1:25:59] you you sent unto john and he bear
[1:26:01] witness unto the truth but i receive not
[1:26:04] testimony from man
[1:26:06] but these things i say that you might be
[1:26:08] saved
[1:26:09] in other words man does not if uh uh
[1:26:13] evidence of me the fact that that god is
[1:26:16] on the scene that was the fact that the
[1:26:17] word is expressed that's the evidence
[1:26:19] that's the testimony
[1:26:20] he was a burning and a shining light
[1:26:22] referring to jonah and you were willing
[1:26:24] for a season to rejoice in his light but
[1:26:26] i have greater witness i have greater
[1:26:29] evidence hallelujah than that of john
[1:26:32] for the works which the father have
[1:26:33] given me to finish the same works that i
[1:26:35] do bear witness of me and the that
[1:26:37] the father has sent me and i want to say
[1:26:38] brothers and sisters jesus christ was
[1:26:41] the evidence if i can use these terms i
[1:26:44] i hope this doesn't throw you for a
[1:26:45] moment
[1:26:46] jesus was the evidence of the ram lamb
[1:26:49] of god
[1:26:53] today you and i are the evidence of the
[1:26:55] you lamb of god
[1:26:58] again
[1:27:03] in hallelujah case of jesus he was the
[1:27:05] word in flesh
[1:27:07] but even in his humanity he acknowledged
[1:27:10] i'm not bearing witness of myself of my
[1:27:13] humanity
[1:27:14] of my human abilities but the works you
[1:27:17] see on display through my life is
[1:27:20] testimony that zoe life is present
[1:27:23] [Music]
[1:27:24] we can say today i am not bearing
[1:27:27] witness of this flesh
[1:27:29] i don't want to be a witness of this
[1:27:30] flesh the bible says crucify this flesh
[1:27:34] right but what i am bearing witness of
[1:27:36] by god's grace is that zoe life is
[1:27:39] present
[1:27:40] hallelujah and the more i can die to
[1:27:42] myself the more i can die to my nonsense
[1:27:44] and my failures and my
[1:27:46] all my shortcomings and complexes and
[1:27:48] issues
[1:27:49] the more god can be seen the more the
[1:27:52] testimony can be that zoe life is here
[1:27:55] zoe life is present
[1:27:58] that is how it should be for every son
[1:28:00] and daughter the testimony of jesus is
[1:28:02] the spirit of prophecy the evidence of
[1:28:04] jesus christ is the eagle anointing on
[1:28:07] the bride when christ is king in our
[1:28:09] lives and we hear from our theophanies
[1:28:12] and he anoints us and uses us as he
[1:28:15] wants to and he displays his life
[1:28:17] through us
[1:28:20] look at this beautiful expression in
[1:28:21] juan john
[1:28:23] if we receive the witness of men the
[1:28:25] witness of god is greater
[1:28:28] for this is the witness the evidence of
[1:28:31] god which he hath testified of his son
[1:28:33] he that believeth on the son of god have
[1:28:36] the witness
[1:28:37] in himself
[1:28:39] hallelujah and you can say well i
[1:28:41] believe that jesus is lord no that's not
[1:28:43] what he's saying because brother adam
[1:28:45] says no man can say that jesus is lord
[1:28:47] until unless god has revealed it to him
[1:28:49] if god has revealed this to you and you
[1:28:52] are now from that revelation from that
[1:28:54] personal revelation i mean of what of
[1:28:57] who i am that personal revelation that i
[1:29:00] was in elohim
[1:29:02] i was part of it i am part of elohim i
[1:29:05] am an expression of the logos i am a
[1:29:09] part of that logos i am an expression in
[1:29:12] this day of what god intended to express
[1:29:15] in this day
[1:29:16] i am a little minute little portion i
[1:29:19] might be a little blood cell of this
[1:29:21] body but i am part of god and the dna is
[1:29:24] in me and nothing can take it away and
[1:29:26] god is working in me and god is is
[1:29:29] hitting on me with that hammer and
[1:29:31] chisel and god is dealing with me day by
[1:29:33] day but god is bringing me to an
[1:29:35] expected end and i trust him for it
[1:29:38] hallelujah
[1:29:39] amen
[1:29:41] he they have the son has life and he
[1:29:43] that hath not the son has not life has
[1:29:45] not that zoe life in us i mean we can
[1:29:48] say today i have the son
[1:29:51] i am a reflection of that son i am an
[1:29:54] expression of that son i'm an expression
[1:29:56] of a specific attribute that was in that
[1:29:59] song
[1:30:00] and like i said brothers and sisters
[1:30:01] it's so easy to look around us and say
[1:30:04] yeah i know brother so and so he's part
[1:30:06] of the bride because he looks so good
[1:30:08] and you might not know that brother
[1:30:10] so-and-so is battling just as much as
[1:30:12] you were better
[1:30:14] or sister so and so
[1:30:16] you know i'll give you some secret
[1:30:18] insight into pasta life for a moment
[1:30:20] right i hope this is okay brother chair
[1:30:23] but you know i so often have it that
[1:30:25] that the family would come to me and say
[1:30:27] i wish i can be like that family they're
[1:30:29] so picture perfect and their kids are
[1:30:31] all in place and all in order and then
[1:30:34] that family would come to me and say i
[1:30:36] wish i could be like that family
[1:30:38] right
[1:30:39] because we look at face value is this
[1:30:41] okay brother chad we look at face value
[1:30:43] and you don't recognize we are all in
[1:30:45] this together
[1:30:47] i mean we're all in this together
[1:30:49] let's lift each other up we do not have
[1:30:52] to compete to try to look like the
[1:30:54] family that's got it all right what we
[1:30:56] want is reality
[1:30:57] what we want is to be real
[1:31:00] what we want is to take god at this word
[1:31:02] and say god i'm not where i want to be
[1:31:05] not where i ought to be but i know where
[1:31:07] i want to be where i want to be
[1:31:10] is the thoughts that you had of me
[1:31:13] where i want to be when i want to be is
[1:31:16] that expected end that you saw for me
[1:31:19] that's where i want to be
[1:31:21] hallelujah i want to now just quickly
[1:31:23] link this through to revelation 10
[1:31:25] goodness gracious our time is flying i
[1:31:28] will look for a place to close soon
[1:31:31] revelations 10 13
[1:31:36] now remember in revelations 10 we read
[1:31:39] about the angel coming down and
[1:31:41] and so forth hands the book to the
[1:31:43] messenger who hands the book to the
[1:31:44] bride who then becomes the book
[1:31:47] and and i want to say comes in union
[1:31:49] with the book
[1:31:51] and then in verse 13
[1:31:54] sorry in verse 11 and he said unto me
[1:31:57] thou must prophesy again before many
[1:31:59] peoples and nations and tongues and
[1:32:01] kings i'm sorry i had the wrong verse
[1:32:03] there verse 11.
[1:32:04] you must prophesy again how
[1:32:08] what we just covered the spirit
[1:32:10] i mean the testimony of jesus is the
[1:32:12] spirit of prophecy
[1:32:14] what i believe this bride in the end
[1:32:17] time is doing is we're expressing
[1:32:20] our individual expression of zoe life
[1:32:25] and the evidence
[1:32:27] that jesus christ under that eagle
[1:32:29] anointing is on the scene
[1:32:32] and that is what is being expressed and
[1:32:34] when we have to prophesy again
[1:32:37] now they prophesy
[1:32:39] yes it's what we say yes it's how we
[1:32:42] testify but much more so how we live
[1:32:46] and much more so
[1:32:48] you see that angel the light came from
[1:32:50] the angel to the earthly angel the
[1:32:52] heavenly angel to the earthly angel
[1:32:53] reflecting through now to the bride of
[1:32:56] this age and that when we partake of
[1:32:58] that book that like life of that book
[1:33:01] the life that zoe life is now being
[1:33:02] expressed and reflected and shining out
[1:33:05] through us
[1:33:06] amen so that light shining through us is
[1:33:09] what's expressing the testimony of jesus
[1:33:11] christ the spirit of prophecy hallelujah
[1:33:14] that's when we must testify again
[1:33:16] prophesy again
[1:33:18] and what we do brothers and sisters we
[1:33:20] are we are expressing we raying out to
[1:33:23] the world the dna of jesus christ the
[1:33:26] zoe life behind us
[1:33:30] and i'll come back to this and
[1:33:32] this is probably a good place to close
[1:33:34] now
[1:33:37] it's individual
[1:33:39] god is a god of variety
[1:33:42] the way in which god is going to reflect
[1:33:44] you through you and the way that god is
[1:33:46] going to reflect through me
[1:33:48] may look slightly different
[1:33:51] now it's going to have the same
[1:33:53] life behind it don't get me wrong
[1:33:55] zoe life is zoe life
[1:33:58] but god expresses zoe life
[1:34:01] through many different fruit it all
[1:34:04] looks slightly different
[1:34:07] but it's the spoken word in every fruit
[1:34:11] it is your spoken word
[1:34:14] that's reflecting through your life
[1:34:16] in other words the path that god foresaw
[1:34:19] for you
[1:34:20] as individual before the foundation of
[1:34:22] the earth
[1:34:23] that's what god wants to express through
[1:34:25] your life and through my life
[1:34:28] and that's my biggest prayer is god
[1:34:31] make that alive in my life
[1:34:34] you see this can be a concept this can
[1:34:36] be
[1:34:37] some
[1:34:38] far off
[1:34:40] theological idea
[1:34:43] but it needs to come down to where the
[1:34:45] rubber hits the road on the everyday
[1:34:47] walk
[1:34:48] the only way this happens is when we die
[1:34:51] daily
[1:34:53] when we repent daily when we get daily
[1:34:56] our own nonsense our own complexes our
[1:34:59] own little roots of bitterness our own
[1:35:00] things out of our lives
[1:35:03] and letting god have his way
[1:35:05] letting god reflect himself
[1:35:08] so that that original zoe life can be
[1:35:10] reflected through us
[1:35:12] and then my brother and sister god
[1:35:14] brings us
[1:35:15] to an expected end
[1:35:18] we'll close with this and i'm just going
[1:35:19] to quickly look for that slide
[1:35:22] i know i had it up before i just
[1:35:30] so i'm going to say put yourself in that
[1:35:32] picture now
[1:35:34] you might feel you're on a weed pile
[1:35:37] you might feel you're just an old stone
[1:35:39] that was
[1:35:40] rejected but i want to say it's okay
[1:35:43] you're in good company
[1:35:46] jesus was rejected
[1:35:48] that foundation stone was rejected
[1:35:51] but the bible says that stone that was
[1:35:53] rejected was made the head of the corner
[1:35:57] so it's okay to sometimes feel like
[1:35:59] we're on a wheat pile
[1:36:01] but my god lift your eyes of spiritual
[1:36:03] revelation up
[1:36:05] to see yourself
[1:36:07] in god's family album
[1:36:09] that god sees you perfect
[1:36:12] and know that god says to you and i want
[1:36:15] you to put your name in this now
[1:36:17] for i know the thoughts that i think
[1:36:19] toward you
[1:36:21] take your name in that thoughts of peace
[1:36:24] and not of evil
[1:36:27] and thoughts to give you an expected end
[1:36:31] that i
[1:36:33] am taking personal responsibility and
[1:36:35] i'm speaking on behalf of god now to
[1:36:37] bring you to
[1:36:39] god is not expecting you to bring you to
[1:36:41] an expected end
[1:36:43] he will bring you to his expected in for
[1:36:48] you for your attribute
[1:36:50] amen let's stand together maybe the
[1:36:52] musicians can come
[1:36:57] let's just pray together
[1:37:03] precious heavenly father
[1:37:07] o lord i
[1:37:10] have expressed the burden that was on my
[1:37:12] heart lord

[1:37:23] to the right places father
[1:37:26] o lord jesus we
[1:37:27] so easily take our eyes off of
[1:37:31] where we come from

[1:37:36] into that
[1:37:37] place where
[1:37:39] we cannot remember father
[1:37:42] when we were shouting for joy
[1:37:45] oh lord jesus we
[1:37:47] don't hear from
[1:37:49] who you really are lord

[1:37:55] channels father lord jesus that you will
[1:37:57] give us eyes of revelation lord to look

[1:38:03] bring us to that expected end lord jesus

[1:38:07] work ourselves up into it lord but to
[1:38:09] trust you and just take you at your word

[1:38:14] faith

[1:41:53] the bride must have it on display
[1:41:57] the hour has come
[1:41:59] for christ in us
[1:42:02] to be completely
[1:42:04] glorified i want the spirit to be free
[1:42:10] to do the greater works in me
[1:42:15] i am free
[1:42:19] my day has come
[1:42:24] now i can
[1:42:27] who i truly am
[1:42:32] i am free
[1:42:35] covered by his blood
[1:42:40] all things
[1:42:43] are possible
[1:42:45] with god
[1:42:49] all things are possible
[1:42:54] with god
[1:42:57] amen
[1:42:59] aren't you so thankful god knew
[1:43:02] before all that he was going to
[1:43:04] accomplish in you
[1:43:06] amen i was thinking as he talked about
[1:43:08] the thoughts of god amen the attributes
[1:43:11] of god which we are one of those
[1:43:12] thoughts
[1:43:14] and all of that moved into logos form
[1:43:16] when when the word moved into logos form
[1:43:19] if the attributes of god moved into
[1:43:21] logos form i was one of those attributes
[1:43:24] of god one of those thoughts of god
[1:43:27] and brother branham even said even when
[1:43:29] that logos was formed in the flesh he
[1:43:31] said when jesus was nailed to the cross
[1:43:34] amen there's something in you now that
[1:43:36] was in him there then
[1:43:39] praise god that was the seed that god is
[1:43:42] trying to bring to life to bear fruit
[1:43:45] say god let it bear fruit in me amen
[1:43:49] i was reminded when he was talking about
[1:43:50] the stones in the temple and then i just
[1:43:53] had a flashback to something that
[1:43:55] brother shimbo said last
[1:43:57] uh thanksgiving when brother shimbo was
[1:43:59] here preaching and he talked about
[1:44:01] michelangelo and the masterpiece he said
[1:44:04] michelangelo chose out amen a chosen
[1:44:07] piece of marble
[1:44:09] it was an elected chosen piece of marble
[1:44:13] and he said that michelangelo
[1:44:16] never created the marble
[1:44:19] into
[1:44:20] never created the marble
[1:44:22] into moses
[1:44:24] but he just with a predetermined vision
[1:44:27] in his mind knew that moses was in this
[1:44:30] stone all he had to do was knock off
[1:44:33] what wasn't moses
[1:44:37] what's god doing he's taking the word
[1:44:39] and he's knocking off what's not part of
[1:44:41] his original vision for you and i amen
[1:44:44] and tonight he was trying to show us i
[1:44:46] have a plan i know what's trapped inside
[1:44:49] that rock i know the place it fits i
[1:44:51] know the fruit i want that seed to bear
[1:44:54] just let the word come amen and nurture
[1:44:57] and draw out that life let the sword of
[1:44:58] the word knock off what's not part of
[1:45:01] the original vision
[1:45:03] and so that god's masterpiece can be
[1:45:06] on display
[1:45:07] i'm so thankful to be reminded
[1:45:10] it's not my plan
[1:45:12] it's his
[1:45:14] it's not the thought i had of myself
[1:45:16] amen i've had lots of thoughts of myself
[1:45:18] and most of them not good
[1:45:20] but it was the thought that he had
[1:45:23] and that thought that i'm expressing now
[1:45:25] that's the thought that matters
[1:45:27] so thankful god will remind us
[1:45:30] that in his original thinking
[1:45:33] there's a part of you and i that was
[1:45:35] there
[1:45:36] and god is now molding and shaping and
[1:45:39] drawing and nurturing
[1:45:41] to get this life to express what that
[1:45:44] thought was
[1:45:45] how many of you want to surrender more
[1:45:47] than ever before
[1:45:48] you know the potential you know what god
[1:45:50] wants what he needs is a surrendered
[1:45:53] vessel he doesn't need our efforts our
[1:45:55] efforts will fail he doesn't need our
[1:45:57] works our own works will fail what he
[1:45:59] needs is somebody who will surrender so
[1:46:02] that his works can produce his life so
[1:46:04] that his effort can fulfill his word
[1:46:08] i said god i want to be a yielded vessel

[1:47:30] before the foundation of the world
