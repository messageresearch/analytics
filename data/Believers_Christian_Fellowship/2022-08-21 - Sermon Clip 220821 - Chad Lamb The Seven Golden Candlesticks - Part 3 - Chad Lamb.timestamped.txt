[0:00] that's why when we see this message and
[0:02] we see pictures of a cloud we know it's
[0:04] the seven angels we know it's the seven
[0:06] thunders we know it's the tying together
[0:08] the loose ends the mystery of god being
[0:10] revealed we can get bogged down and this
[0:13] types this and seven of this and seven
[0:15] of that or we can realize everything
[0:17] christ has for his bride is here now
[0:20] everything that was impartial before is
[0:22] not impartial anymore that's the whole
[0:24] point friends amen we're not here with
[0:26] one eye trying to see the picture we're
[0:28] here with all seven eyes on the lab
[0:31] trying to see who's seeing in fullness
[0:32] the picture that god's painting
[0:35] you can say i'm confused about seven
[0:37] seals and seven
[0:38] vials and seven trumpets and seven
[0:40] thunders and seven horns and seven eyes
[0:42] don't get confused we'll make it simple
[0:45] amen what god had measured out through
[0:46] the church ages he has come back in
[0:48] fullness and he wants to live through
[0:50] you
[0:51] [Music]
[0:52] that's the whole picture of the
[0:54] lampstand the whole imagery is christ in
[0:57] the midst of the seven golden
[0:58] candlesticks in the lord's day amen not
[1:02] not in another day not in the previous
[1:03] day not in church ages in the lord's day
[1:06] which is today
[1:07] [Music]
[1:08] he wants his light to shine through you
[1:11] he wants the full measure of this word
[1:13] to shine and you and i he wants us to be
[1:16] a burning shining light in this dark
[1:19] world
[1:21] and i'll tell you friends it's the only
[1:23] light in this world
[1:26] because when this light is removed
[1:30] it's total darkness
[1:32] and god in his mercy will send two more
[1:35] but not until this one's gone
[1:38] and then two more will come on the scene
[1:40] and shine that light of the full word to
[1:42] the jews
[1:44] so that they can come into the full
[1:45] revelation
[1:48] what a wonderful day we live in
[1:51] what a merciful time to look down
[1:53] through the bible and see every every
[1:56] bible type and shadow was pointing to
[1:58] this day
