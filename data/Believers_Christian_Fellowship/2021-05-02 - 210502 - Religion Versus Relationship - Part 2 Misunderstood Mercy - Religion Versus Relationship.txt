TRANSCRIPT
========================================
turn your eyes upon jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen praise the lord it's good to be with you this morning and while we're here together standing let's go ahead and take our bibles and turn to genesis chapter 3. i want to share a real brief testimony with you brother john kadima came around back just to share a testimony that comes from sister susanna bondo and she wanted him to share it because she doesn't speak english but apparently she i remember she came up a couple weeks ago to have prayer and there was something that she needed from the lord and she told brother jean to share with me to say that i told her i believe when we were down here i said stay focused on god and do not fear god will answer and she said as soon as her daughter was translating as soon as i said that she said the lord she heard a voice inside say that is thus saith the lord do not fear and keep focused on god and do not fear and she had a real serious situation we're seeking the lord for and god supernaturally absolutely this past week delivered her from that situation what an amazing god we serve amen it's exciting god can do what he wants amen when he wants he works individually and in the people that god is even using have no idea what's happening because it's not man it's god amen praise be to god i want to remind you also that we've got communion this afternoon we'll come back for that amen all right genesis chapter 3 verse 6. we're going to continue on with religion versus relationship part two and the subtitle for this one is misunderstood mercy and a lack of trust misunderstood mercy and a lack of trust i told sister amy when i wrote down the title for her this morning i said i feel like a real preacher with a long title amen genesis chapter 3 verse 6 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself let's just bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus we thank you father that we can come like this once again for lord your grace and your mercy has brought us here you've sustained us you've given us life and health and strength to bring us back again to worship you and fellowship together around your word we pray god that you would have preeminence among us that you would speak and that we would hear that you would anoint the speaker and you would anoint our ears to hear god that you would give us a gift of revelation lord that we might see you in your word and we might see what it is you're doing in this day god that we might see your program and that we might enter in your program according to your will and then your program find you lord find relationship with you there we ask your blessings on everything that's said and done may you move among us lord in jesus name we pray amen you can all have your seats um i said we're continuing on with the same thought religion versus relationship we may be on it for some time i'm not really sure but there's just very very uh uh it's been very rich and very deep for me and there's a lot here that i'd like to share just as the lord leads because it's impossible when you come when something opens like like it did for me it's almost like god takes another layer off of the bible and you got to chase it through the whole bible and it becomes overwhelming because there's no way that that i can take what is in my heart by revelation and through the the fallacy the foolishness of preaching amen be able to take it exactly like it's in here and plant it in your heart the same way so there has to be the in the mediator of the holy ghost amen it's the only way that god can can do this because human language is so limited amen in human language cannot convey a revelation human language can only give the mechanism or the words or the information that god can take then and quicken to a revelation amen so we're dependent on god we see here that from the very beginning we know brother ham told us that that genesis is the seed chapter the seed book of the entire bible that everything that we find every cult every clan everything begin in genesis and the more that we study the word of god and the more revelation comes the more we realize that that prophet knew what he was talking about and we always believed it we always said yes that's true i mean we would we would never deny that we say it's true we believe it that's that's absolutely the truth but it's becoming more and more real more vivid more colorful more tangible that that prophet of god knew exactly what he was talking about amen even when he we made the statement he says uh somebody said you just don't know your bible somebody told him that brother you just don't know your bible he says yeah but i know the author real well and that becomes evident and apparent amen because the man and the man the human side would take a scripture and he wouldn't he could actually even misquote the scripture and maybe get the words jumbled or even the characters wrong and maybe get moses in place of noah or no we replace of moses and he could he can maybe even get the number of people that were killed or the events out of sequence i hope you understand what i'm saying but because he knew the author of the word he was always correct in what he was portrayed amen the point that he was driving the the goal that he had and what he was saying the truth that he was preaching was every time always correct even if he said moses instead of noah he was still correct not correct in a way of of making every word he said infallible that's not what i'm talking about brother ben would even go back and say i got that wrong i made a mistake amen so not every word that the prophet spoke was infallible but the truth that he was bringing was true amen it was the truth because he knew the author amen and when he knew the author he knew the intent he knew the mind behind the bible he knew what the bible was written for amen he knew what the mystery of the whole word was amen and when he says my bible has become a new book and he comes back and he begins preaching amen from that time on he's preaching the revelation the mystery of god amen and he's preaching the mystery of god revealed and he knows exactly what he's talking about god so i don't think any of us are foolish enough to believe that that that when brother branham when he actually said you know moses uh built the ark then now i'm going to say moses built the ark because the prophet said it come on come on and he said 700 didn't bow the knee to baal but then he come back said i was wrong and seventh down but because under the inspiration he said i'm going to say 700 from now on that that's that's a religious demon trying to move you off the word of god but the point was under that seal that was broken to elijah that day was a revelation of predestination and election that god had even though the prophet couldn't see god had those who had not bowed to need the baal and that's nothing but the truth so that prophet knew exactly what he's talking about amen and so that's why he makes these statements and as we go on the things that we've believed and the things that we've known to be true if i could say it this way they become more true i don't know if that's even makes any sense but but we begin to see it more clearly and in more color and in the beginning we see that the the devil began to anoint a vessel and that vessel was the serpent and the serpent was something that was similar to man but was not man and this is what the the devil is always doing he's always coming amen he's always getting to the closest thing he can to god and he uses the closest thing he can to what god uses and he uses it for deception does that make sense this is the way the devil is always working amen and so the closest angel to god amen was was lucifer and in that position as close as he get to god he begins to mimic god and mirror god through the closest thing that he can get to go on and what god's using and by that he brings a deception and so now god is using man he has set man up to be a reflection of his image and that reflection is now on the earth and he set him up to be a god on the earth amen and the closest thing to man was the serpent so now the devil comes in and he uses the closest thing to what god is using to bring deception and when he brings deception now he actually brings a hybridization and that hybridization actually allows and permits the devil to get closer because now it's all mixed together and through that integration and that mixing amen now he begins to weave his way in amen and he's working in parallel to where god is working i hope that that makes sense in the message conference brother bam said oh the hour the tremendous time that we're living when menace told her their error instead of trying to come back and say father i'm wrong forgive me they still hide behind the fig leaves fig leaves is what they sow together themselves and that the word religion means a covering and they try to make themselves a handmade covering and man hasn't changed yet today so in the fall when when when she did partake of the sin and gave him to her husband and he ate also then their eyes were open and they saw that they were naked and and they sewed themselves together fig leaves and made themselves aprons and we talked about this wednesday how they made a religion for themselves a religion means a covering and so now they're trying to cover their own sins or they're trying to re create their own atonement or if i could say the way brother graham said it they're trying to have a covering with no atonement there's no bloodshed there's nothing amen that will substitute for them amen to restore a relationship now what they've done is they've created a covering for their sin it's a man-made covering that they have made themselves and so what they're seeking is they're seeking an atonement or a covering without an atonement and this covering amen is not to bring him back in fellowship with god this is the shocking statement that i made last time but i still stand true to it that religion amen the purpose of religion because religion began amen right here with this with this fall amen men sowing fig leaves together it was propagated by cain it was carried out further by nimrod when we look at this kind of religion this man-made religion religion is not intended to bring man back into fellowship with god it's the the devil's purpose i mean in what's so deceptive if the devil sells it with the premise of this religion is intended to bring us back to god and then the religion is not intended to bring us back to god religion is intended to create a covering that will actually keep us from god it's the barrier to god and because the religion amen the religion is to bring a sense of security a false justification a false covering so under the religion you do not need god you need the religion because the religion becomes the covering because without religion you're naked and cain did not want to say adam did not want to face god naked amen so he made himself a covering and that covering amen he was somehow comfortable with the covering until he heard the voice of god come walking in the garden in the cool of the evening and when the when he then it says when he heard the voice he see he hid himself from the presence of god because the voice amen denotes his presence his voice denotes his presence and so when the voice he had to hide from that presence because when he heard the voice he knew he was naked but he was still had his fig leaves on he still was behind his religion amen which he felt comfortable with until he heard the voice because he wasn't hiding amen until he heard the voice when he heard the voice he began to hide so so he realized the voice amen the voice uncovered pierced through the religion and still left him bare and naked so god came to him and god amen now gave another kind of a covering and this covering was going to come by the shed blood of an innocent one a type of the coming of jesus christ he was going to offer a lamb and the blood of the lamb amen would atone for their sins and he would cover them amen with the with the remnants of the life of that lamb he would cover them in the garment made from the slain lamb and in covering them he would he would make a way to restore relationship and restore fellowship so god's provided way god's provided way is always the way of his word the word is always the path to the atonement and the purpose of the atonement is reconciliation with god without the word you cannot get to the blood brother branham said they say they're they're getting to the blood they're getting people to the blood but they've rejected the very path to the blood the word so without the word you cannot get to the blood without the blood there's no reconciliation of relationship [Music] so now you understand clearly what the purpose of relate religion is religion is to keep you from the word path to the atonement the religion is a false covering that will not restore relationship that the discovering is a barrier to relationship and a separation from atonement that's why when brother ben was preaching he finally gets to the point says now i understand why i've always been against the nominations the spirit in him was striking against it but then under the revelation he began to see what was behind it praise god so now god made a way of reconciliation and the message god hiding himself in simplicity he says in the beginning when man sinned it showed the nature of man he's always trying to hide from god and make himself a way that he can feel justified a religion that's been a religion means a covering so he tried to make his own religion and the message fellowship he says then god made a remedy for that in closing i might say this in the garden of eden when god saw that his children had sinned and had gone from him god himself who is the supreme judge made a reconciliation so he could restore that fellowship to his creatures by the shed blood of an animal and the shed blood lasted for many years speaking of the coming of christ so god so so god say it this way adam made a covering to hide himself from god or to hide his sin from god god exposed to sin and brought an atonement for the purpose of being reconciled back to fellowship with his creatures so the religion what we were saying wednesday that religion is an attempt to to to cover or hide ourselves from the judgment of god it's an attempt to keep ourselves from the judgment of god so we create our own covering that covers our sin so that now we don't need to pass through the fire of judgment and there's no reason to pass through the fire of judgment because now my sins are covered but they're covered by a religion or they are and the religion can be any form of religion i mean you just you can make up your own religion and under my religious order keeping my own religious order i now have a uh uh i'm now self-justified by my own actions so now i don't really i don't need god because through my actions and my my beliefs and my order i am now covered but then god is so gracious that in every age he has sent a voice and that voice he speaks of his denotes his presence amen and when it denotes his presence then it makes all the religion as nakedness and that is why the false vine always hated the true vine because when that true vine had the word of god they became the living voice in their day and when they became the living voice in their day it was it was showing the presence of god the presence of god was making bear naked totally uncovering everybody under the religious order in that day and then the religious order had to stop that voice amen and because they can't stop the word they try to destroy the vessel that is carrying the word and so now we begin to understand the whole bible this has been the whole bible so god's purpose in bringing his voice and his presence in the in in the face of sin is always to to uncover our false covering that's what the prophet of god did in this day he absolutely laid bare all the false coverings that's why the denominations at first liked him and then they hated him because at first in the beginning of his ministry oh friends this is going to get so good in the beginning of his ministry because of the camaraderie and the fellowship and the mighty signs and the mighty wonders and all the works amen the prophet of god originally and when he launched down into his ministry it looked as though he was justifying the denominations because of the mighty signs and the wonders and the works and the camaraderie and the fellowship amen it looked as if you know methodists were sponsoring baptists were sponsoring the catholics were even coming everybody was coming and rallying around this gift and god was doing mighty signs and wonders it looked as though it was a justification for the systems and all the systems embraced him but when he began to be the voice by sharing the revealed word then instead of justifying the systems he was laying it bare and making their system their nakedness and then they turned their opinion through the 50s they turned from loving this this man with this gift and accepting him to beginning to reject him and the more he was rejected the more of the voice that he spoke and the more the voice he spoke the more he was rejected because he was laying bare the systems in the message the super sign said adam he tried to make a super religion without an atonement they're still trying to do it a super religion make a religion so he could live any way he wanted to without an atonement and still have a covering he tried to do it in the beginning and he's still trying to do it but god's provided way was an atonement it will never work no other way it has to come back to an atonement and if you write down this word atonement if you have a piece of paper and a pen and you write down if you write down the word atonement a t o n e m e t atonement then draw a line between the t and the o and the e and the m you have a t line o n e line m e n t and what you have is at one mint that was god's desire with the blood sacrifice is at one meant that's the purpose of an atonement is to bring reconciliation at one minute with god and man when man cindy had to have an atonement to bring at one minute and so the religion does not bring atonement cannot bring atonement amen only the word can bring you to the atonement which is the price that was paid to bring a reconciliation back to god because god wanted atonement man wanted a covering god wanted atonements this is the difference between religion and relationship now let's look at genesis chapter four together let's just keep moving on i'm gonna there's a lot i want to say and there's a certain distance i want to get to but i'm not willing to skip over anything so we can preach wednesday and sunday and we'll just keep going because i just want to catch i want to pull all that god has for us out of this and i don't want to get in a hurry genesis chapter 4 verse 3 and in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the lord and abel he also brought her the first things of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect and to able into his offering but unto cain and his offering he had not respect and cain was very roth and his countenance fell so we went through this last time i'm not going to go back through everything that we said but but brother says in the message indictment he says and that's the only place he meets with man today is under the shed blood that's what abel produced by faith with by faith abel offered a more excellent sacrifice amen and his in his gift testifying that he was righteous amen so the fact that he could by revelation bring the right gift he could only bring the right gift if he had the right revelation and faith is a revelation so by faith by revelation he offered a more excellent sacrifice and his works testifying that he was righteous amen he was righteous because he could believe he wasn't just righteous just because he could perform i hope he can catch this it wasn't just the performance or the act amen that made him righteous because he did the right thing he could only do the right thing when he had the revelation by faith so what proved his righteousness was his ability to receive revelation by faith [Music] so his works amen were an outcropping of his faith and they testified that he was righteous it wasn't it wasn't the works of his own mind it wasn't the works that he conjured up he didn't just do something that was a little bit nicer than what cain did what cain did was nicer than what abel did what cain did took more work more effort it was more beautiful what abel did was more some a simple more humble it was actually dirty and gruesome in many ways not appealing at all to the flesh amen so it's not that he he offered a more excellent sacrifice in the way that human reasoning would think he offered a more excellent sacrifice nobody with human reasoning and a human mind and carnality would look and say he offered a more excellent sacrifice what made it more excellent is he had caught the mind of god and what god wanted and god wanted atonement because god wanted fellowship with his children and he had caught the mind of god amen and that's why hebrews says without faith it is impossible to please him so he came without faith could not please god amen but abel by faith could please god and his in his in his offering his gift would testify that he was righteous he didn't become righteous by offering the gift he was righteous because he was of the seed of god and because he was of the seed of god he had the capacity to receive revelation and the revelation produced the right understanding on how to please god and when he pleased god his works testified that he was righteous praise god friends god is not looking down at us and we've not we're not bribed because we made the right choice we're not his bride because we've done the right works you've not become righteous because you realized i was doing wrong and now i'm going to start doing right and now that made me righteous you were bribed before the foundation of the world if you're elect a c gene of god you were chosen to be bribed before the foundation of the world and inside of you was a crystal brother behind said that could pick up on the waves moving through the air and you could somehow you were tuned in to a certain frequency already and when all of a sudden you came in contact with that wave as it moved through the revelation that came through the messenger in our day all of a sudden it hit the crystal you could pick it up and it said this is the way walk you in it and you could say amen and when you when you saw that by faith this is what god wants now you threw away everything you had before and you went running and embraced this truth and embracing this truth you found out what was pleasing to god but without faith it's impossible to please god and so now by faith by love you begin to do the things out of the word that god has showed us by revelation are the things he wants us to do amen why because you're righteous you're not trying to become righteous your works are testifying that you are righteous brother rem said we're back in indictment again i'll read the first sentence again that's the only place he meets with man today is under the shed blood of the sacrifice i don't care if you're methodist baptist presbyterian if you can forget your differences roman catholic whatever you might be and will come under the shed blood god will meet with man both of us there that's where we can all meet and fellowship on the same grounds but otherwise he will not meet just because you're a methodist he'll not meet just because you're a pentecostal he'll meet with you under one condition that's under the shed blood when your sins has been confessed and expelled in his presence then by the blood and the blood is always before him and therefore he only he only can see you through that shed blood and your whitest no when you've confessed your sins otherwise you're not there you cannot fellowship that's the reason that you don't see things happening in the churches they confess that they believe the blood but they reject the very plan to get to the blood the word and god in this day has given us his word and his word in this day is the path back to the blood because the blood the chemistry of the blood amen purchase redemption of all creation that exchange price was already paid and then it was paid at calvary but brother man said the chemistry of that blood went into back into the judean soil from whence it came that's what the prophet says so it's not that blood amen that you can get a fresh application of today that blood was shed and was the purchase price it was an exchange rate paid for the redemption of the word but now to come in contact with that blood amen is to come in contact with the life that was in that blood and the life that was in that blood was christ amen and that when the blood cell was split when it was spilled amen that life was released and now that life could come back into the believer and the only way to access that life is by the word because that's the life of the word so if we reject the word you can't get the life of the word rejecting the word so when we hear water baptism in jesus name and we reject that word how do you get to that life rejecting the word and that's the life of the word so god in his mercy he has made sure that he's had a voice amen in each age and each dispensation of time and that voice will give the word for that day and the word for that day is the path back in contact with the life of that word amen which will become an atonement for you and bring you back in reconciliation with god praise god luther came with the just shall live by faith that was the word of god and under that word of god when that word was lifted up it became a path back to reconciliation with god and in that day under that revival i mean people were awakening to the fact that that i'm justified by faith and they were moving back into a relationship with god amen so what did the devil do he said fallen name brother said fallen angels that had left their first estate amen what did they do they went into the lutheran church amen and they took and obscured that path back to god by making it a religion now so god raised up a wesley and wesley began to bring sanctification amen as a second work of grace and sanctification by the spirit and what he was doing is he was opening a path of reconciliation back to god where the children of god were coming back into fellowship with god by the word but then what happened fallen angels came in and they turned it into a religious form in a religious order and when they did now the whole purpose was to keep people from reconciliation under that word for their day not to bring them to reconciliation so they reject the very plan to get to the blood the word that's why the word being restored in our day is so critical the word brings the life until that seals were broken and opened under the the seventh church age messengers ministry the seventh angel amen the brotherhood the holy ghost was bound by these rivers and denominations he was bound the holy ghost is the life of christ amen it's the life of the word and the life of the word was bound because the word was limited by denominations so the limiting of the word amen was binding of the holy ghost but under the opening of the seals amen and now it's the holy ghost back in the church again because the full word is here the denominational veil has been rent amen the chains have been taken off amen and the word has been restored and it's a path back only this time it's not to partial life it's to the full life for what what's the purpose why were the seals open because you can't have a marriage without a reconciliation god can't marry a system he can't marry a denomination he can't marry amen he can't marry he can't unify he can't be united back to come back and fellowship until there has been an atonement amen and after an atonement then there can be a reconciliation amen in a unification back to god but in this day god did just he wasn't just restoring a deeper level of fellowship what he was trying to do was bring a union a marriage in order to bring this marriage he had to bring the fullness of his word to bring the fullness of his life so that there'll be a full atonement made for the children of god so that he can be married to you it was a path back a reconciliation a path to the atonement that's why brother branham said i believe it was an invisible union he said if you're standing with this word and own this word i'm trying to tell you where you're standing you're standing totally justified as if you've never done it in the first place now under that condition you don't need a religion you don't need a covering because under the revealed word of this day there was a door open in heaven a path back to reconciliation a unification of god and man that would not amen would not just bring another level of fellowship or a greater understanding of god it would actually bring a condition to where you have never done it in the first place it brings you back to the original intent god had in his mind it brings you to a virgin condition what for why was this path open because he he the heart purpose of god was to have a bride of his own choosing it's been the purpose from the very beginning he was shown to us all the way back in the creation in the garden of eden amen it was defiled it was broke so god could bring a restoration so he could portray all of his attributes of savior and the healer and deliver he wanted he wanted a people who would know him and so this this whole cycle of redemption has brought an understanding a full understanding of god but god is the one who wants reconciliation he's the supreme judge and when the supreme judge came down in eden the supreme judge now judged his children wrong but the supreme judge was also a father and the father brought an atonement so that he can reconcile the relationship but in our day at the opening of the seals we saw the white wigged one come down who is what the supreme judge of heaven and earth and the supreme judge of heaven and earth came down to judge denomination and religion and lay you naked amen but he came down he is the sacrificial lamb he is the word that bled for you and died for you he is the atonement he is your husband he is your bridegroom and now you're not believing in an atonement you're united with your atonement you are one with your atonement amen the word that bled for you is your bridegroom amen the reward that died for you and bled for you and atoned for you is also your bridegroom and so the supreme judges come down amen the supreme judge came down in eden to have fallen children to judge their religion to judge their heir but he provided an atonement an innocent life that would go in exchange for their life so he could bring back a restoration of fellowship but now in satan's eden the supreme judges come again it's another eden visitation we've had another eden visitation in this day when man has made his own coverings and coverings of every flavor and coverings of every style and coverings of every shape and size amen and he's come down as a voice in this day and what he's done is he's destroyed all coverings and made it naked and the supreme judge comes with the atonement which is the bleeding bloody word and he has a way to wash you from all the filth of these prostitutes which is what the religious order of the day of the world and how does he wash you from the religious prostitutes by the washing of the water of the word and he is the word so who's washing you your bridegroom who's perfecting your bridegroom who's cleansing your bridegroom who's atoning for your bridegroom amen what has happened he has come a supreme judge in this day amen to bring the path back to the atonement and he is the atonement to bring back fellowship what his purpose was from the beginning you see what a day we live in friends there's never been a day like this day oh praise god i feel like i can't even preach anymore that's enough friends that's enough to sustain us for for everything that's it that's the whole picture that's the whole that's what's happened in our day that's the whole thing you're free you're absolutely free you're as free as any human being has ever been before the only thing you're waiting for is for the last one to come in so your atoms can change amen but you're free you've been freed by the supreme judge you've been freed by the presence of of the one who atoned for you the atonement himself the bleeding word free from the filth of the prostitutes free from the ideas of men free from everything that would separate you from fellowship with god and by that atonement he's brought you back into your ought to be conditioned you're just waiting for your body to catch up he says and three kinds of believers i'm still reviewing from wednesday three kinds of believers now look god had testified the bible said hebrews the fourth chapter the 11th chapter god testifying of his gifts that he was righteous god vindicated his offering god made proof that that was what he accepted he's speaking of abel now that was his word his plan so god when he testified of abel's offering what he was is abel had found the word for his day and when he found the word he found the way back to reconciliation and god was testify that he found the word and and the word is his plan and told cain do the same thing and live but do you think that he would forfeit his idea no sir see that's why the apostle paul said and the way it is considered heresy worship by the god of my fathers it has to look and be in such a way that it's so not appealing to the unbeliever it's so not appealing to cain's line or to the false vine that they don't want anything to do with it and even when they when cain in mercy is given an opportunity just to repeat the process without faith without faith he is given the opportunity to repeat the process but because he doesn't have no faith he doesn't have a love for god amen he doesn't have the seed of god he won't give up his idea even to repeat the process and because god always brings man to a warning before he brings in the judgment and he gave cain a warning and when cain failed he brought him to judgment so now i would i want to continue on i don't want to get hung up but the god of this evil age notice what he will do his thoughts he thought god dwelt in worldly beauty he did that in heaven said never began the garden of eden it began in heaven when lucifer the son of the morning exalted himself in beauty and wanted a more beautiful kingdom than that of michael and he thought that god dwelt in beauty and notice cain he didn't want no blood sacrifice he came down and offered the fruit or the fields of beauty upon his altar very religious done everything that just exactly like abel done offered a sacrifice fell down before god in worship obedient in every way but without the revelation of the word he was obedient in every way except the revelation of the word he couldn't go by revelation and the word was from the beginning god's plan so what was his plan from the beginning the word the word was from the beginning god's plan and if if you could just hang this in your mind for a minute and let's explore this for just a minute from the beginning god's plan was the word what was his plan his plan of reconciliation his plan of redemption his plan of salvation was always the word and that way when god now would begin to save from the save his children amen from the destruction of the world he would bring a word to a prophet he would bring it to noah and no one now would be a preacher of righteousness testifying of that word and that word became the way of salvation noah's ark in his day that word was the plan of salvation because i i want us to catch this because if you'll catch it it'll it'll expose the fallacy of denominations because the denominations are looking back to a previous day to a previous dispensation and they're looking back and accepting what is true and what is right amen but because they refuse the word for this day amen they don't get any benefit from what god did before so they're looking back amen and we find out in moses's day amen the word was always the plan so the word came to moses and moses came and brought the word and this word was a fulfillment of a prophecy given to abraham and under that dispensation in that day of a word through moses there was going to be amen an exodus out of egypt the salvation a restoration back into the land it was going to be god's plan god's plan is always the word he always sends the word and by the word he executes his plan and outside of that word that is sent for that day it is impossible for you to be in the plan of god because his word was his plan from the beginning so people want to have a redemption and they want to have a salvation without the word but it was the word that bled for you the word was made flesh jesus christ when he came on earth it was the word made flash and that word made flesh was a word that bled for you a word that died for you the atonement was the bleeding word so now now the link to that atonement to a bleeding word is to receive the word in your day because it's the same one it's the same person who bled for you and died for you it's christ the revealed word of god so in your day now moses was the plan in that day amen then then david became the plan in his day and all the prophets were the plan in their day and jesus christ was the plan in his day amen do you see what i'm saying the word for that day was always god's plan [Music] luther's message was the plan in that day wesley's message was to plan on that day the pentecostal message was the plan in that day and so we we have sometimes individuals who want the benefit of the word without the person of the word and the person of the word is the i am and the i am is the present tense god and the present tense god is the person amen and how can you have the benefit of the word and reject the person so the word has always been god's plan let me read this again this out of the god of this evil age the word was from the beginning god's plan but god revealed by revelation the very thing that he vindicated and punctuated that that was right not religion not an altar not belonging to church not making a sacrifice not being sincere but by the revelation of the word of god that was god's plan not by all of those works there's nothing wrong with those works amen those works are an outcropping of faith amen but without faith the works are dead not religion i want to read it again not an altar not belonging to church not making a sacrifice not being sincere but by the revelation of the word of god so my brother ben said above all else pray for revelation let's look at genesis chapter 4 verse 8 again and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him from here last time we went to first john 3 11 and i'll read that same passage for you it says for this is the message that you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another not as cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own works were evil and his brothers righteous marvel not my brethren if the world hates you now he slew his brother why did he slay his brother because his own works were evil and his brothers were righteous and his brother's faith was declaring his righteousness and cain's lack of faith amen produced evil works and and listen the hebrew says by faith abel offered a more excellent sacrifice it didn't mean that cain didn't offer an excellent sacrifice because the sacrifice that cain brought would be would would actually be established by moses as the offering of first fruits so he brought the offering of first fruits which was going to be under the law under moses law an offering and a commandment amen to bring that offering to god so it wasn't the offering that was evil so what did cain do what was his works that was so evil amen because you know he made this he built an altar he made a beautiful sacrifice he knelt down and worshiped god but he could not operate by faith everything he did was for his own purpose by his own choosing by his own reasoning and declared all of his works to be evil and abel's were righteous because abel's were done by faith now all of a sudden all the religious orders and all the good things and and all the nice to your neighbor stuff and all that brother man said no fault against it that's fine nothing wrong with it but without revelation it just comes back to being evil works what do you mean build a hospital and and feed the poor and and send books to missionaries that's all evil works it's evil when it becomes a covering that separates you from the path back to the true atonement when it's the intellect of man amen producing a works that makes him feel justified because he's keeping an order of a church and because he's keeping the order of a church amen and he feels like this is his covering amen all of those works become evil because all of those works are reinforcing the same false message that without revelation you're fine so it's not feeding the poor as evil but feeding the poor believing that somehow it is atoning for you and making you right with god is evil oh i hope it goes down deep and i hope we don't leave it out there because we can come into a religious order called the message when luther brought a revelation what followed false angels fallen angels got in to take the truth and make a religious order out of it to make a religion wesley same thing pentecostal same thing and don't think just because you say message that all those demons are afraid and run away in the beginning lucifer the satan came to the closest thing he could find to where god was working and he began to work through the closest thing until he brought a hybridization and now he could twist the two vines together so you can say baptist is wrong all you want but the deception has to be so close it would deceive the very elect if possible so the deception has to be all around the bride not in the bride she's not going to be deceived she's predestinated not to be this time but all around and that's why we could have religious orders in keeping an order of a church and and you know there's a certain order that comes to the word of god even abel abel he had to offer a sacrifice that was in order the church and his faith amen his faith is what moved him into action amen in his offering testified he was righteous he couldn't just believe his believing put him in action and he had to offer the lamb and our faith in the message of the hour puts us in the works and by faith in the message of the hour recognizing the word amen it begins to produce a work in us to where now we clean up the outside we don't dress like we used to dress we don't we don't cut our hair we don't wear makeup we don't watch the movies we don't go to the places of entertainment we don't tell the same jokes we don't believe the same false doctrines because abel by faith he still he believed but he still had to offer the sacrifice because that's what the word was for his day i hope you understand so there is an order of worship that still remains but that order of worship is by faith a woman should not cut her hair by faith she should not wear revealing clothes by faith a man should not watch worldly entertainment or tell their by faith it's an outcropping that he believes this is the word of god i see it in the word i believe it this is what god wants and i want to do it and then he receives a power in him and that power in him begins to do it you can have somebody come into a group of believers come into a church and they can see the order they can see don't cut your hair and there's a certain reasonability to that and you can reason the word and a certain modesty and a certain staying away from the world and and you could have somebody that can come into the order of the message and not come into christ i'm trying to be so careful how i say this because the truth is a razor's edge between right and wrong so i'm trying to be super careful so if you just allow me to be careful that's why it's dangerous oh how am i going to say this it can be dangerous to start saying i go to a message church now that term in itself is not evil i mean it's not wrong don't get scared if you say that this but the mentality that can follow [Music] can become very dangerous as if if i go to the right church and do the right things i will be right and this goes for every church so it becomes dangerous to say i go to a message church and it also becomes dangerous to say it can become dangerous to say i'm in the message depending on what you mean by saying i'm in the message because the message is christ so if that means i'm in christ you're fine but if i come into the message and i've come into a order of beliefs in a certain number of doctrines and then all of a sudden that becomes my new covering this is why god doesn't have grandchildren you're not raised in the message the message is christ how do you get into the message how do you get into christ by new birth not by natural birth to parents who are in christ so the terminology and now don't be don't be like when i'm around brother chad i can't say they go to a message church i don't care about the terminology i'm just telling you that it can begin after generations and after time to bring a mentality and that mentality is wrong [Music] i've had people say you know i had one minister say to me one time one pastor says you know sometimes i have people leave the church but as long as they go to another message church i'm fine with that and i agreed with him i said yeah i feel the same way but even that mentality that verbiage if it doesn't carry the right revelation can become dangerous because now all we've done is moved our letter from one baptist church to another baptist earth but i'm still part of the baptist church what we need is an experience with jesus christ himself and we need an individual revelation like abel god and that revelation will give us an open eye that said this is truth this is god this is the atonement this is what cleans me [Applause] not my ability to recognize that this is probably right and my fear of being wrong that sticks me with a certain set of beliefs what we need is to get into christ it was hard to be more closely associated and aligned with jesus christ than for judas iscariot who tell me who who was closer to him and more closely aligned to him in his earthly ministry than judas iscariot but it did not equal salvation for judas iscariot [Music] because he had no predestinated seed and when it come to the end he could believe almost everything but when it come to the end he just couldn't accept that man being god sometimes close association is dangerous being close to the truth sometimes can be more dangerous than being far away from oh god help us i hope you catch the heart of what i'm saying i'm trying so hard to not inject myself let's go to genesis chapter 4. still many many things we want to share genesis chapter 4 verse 9. and the lord god said king unto cain where is abel thy brother where is abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brother's keeper and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground and now art thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand when thou tilt us to ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth and cain said unto the lord my punishment is greater than i can bear behold thou has driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me and the lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth came vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord set a mark upon cain lest any finding him should kill him and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of eden and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bear enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch now i know we read the scripture before but i didn't get to go into it the way i would i i would like to today cain he refused to take god's act of mercy and god and mercy said just do as thy brother just just if you do well want to be well with thee and and and and he refused that and then in the conversation with abel he rose up and he slew his brother and then he confronted god and god he lied right to god's face where's thy brother he said i know not am i my brother's keeper he did a pretty bad job of keeping him he had just killed him and god now says you're going to be cursed you're cursed you'll be sent off in the face of the earth you're going to be sent out from sent out and you're going to be a fugitive and a vagabond and i'm going to look at this word fugitive in vagabond the word fugitive means to quiver totter shake reel stagger wander move sift uh wave or tremble so the whole the whole essence of this word fugitive is instability tremble waver wave wonder instability and and i would i would say it this way just because it serves my purpose a lack of stability and a lack of security okay oh because so god says you're going to be a fugitive in a vagabond so that's fugitive a vagabond is a very similar word image to shake to waver to wander to move to and fro it meant to move to and fro to wander aimlessly so god says you're going to be trembling and shaking and faltering and you're going to be wondering and so that is the curse that is given upon cain and cain does not think that this is a fair curse in in verse 13 and cain said unto the lord my punishment is greater than i can bear this man has no sense of who god is he has absolutely no respect for the supreme judge he's looking at him saying my punishment as if god is unjust as if god is not not fair as if god somehow has made a mistake in an inappropriate judgment of cain and cain is so exalted within himself because he has the spirit of lucifer within him he is so exalted within himself that he believes that he can tell god you're unjust and you're unfair and cain in making a statement like that is trying to put himself on an equal basis with god because god is the supreme judge he knows best if god says you know if god looks at you and says you're a purple monkey you say i'm a purple monkey who are you to rile against god who are you to say that god is wrong who are you to say that his word somehow has faltered or failed and his judgment is incorrect but this is cain's mentality amen he's so exalted and so bright with his deceit in his own brightness that he believes that that this is not fair and then just follow that thought my punishment is greater than i can bear behold thou has driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth he repeats the statement that god made and it shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me now like we said wednesday cain was not so much worried he was not heartbroken that he was leaving the presence of god because he was not worried about reconciliation because he didn't desire the atonement even when he was given an opportunity to reconcile he rejected the reconciliation because the only way to reconciliation was through self-judgment through humility through needing god and cain did not want to need god and he did not want to humble himself and he did not want to omit what kind of condition he was in so now he says i'll be sent out of your presence and here's the part that he's really worried about and whoever finds me will slay me i won't get to continue with my plans my goals my objectives my life he was going to live a life without the presence of god and he wanted to preserve that yes life right this is religion this is the heart of religion now listen what's said next this is so important and the lord said unto him therefore whosoever slave cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord set a mark upon cain this is the mark of the beast lest any finding him should kill him and cain went out from the presence of the lord which he was fine with and dwell in the land of not on the east of eden and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bear enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of a son enoch now here's really what i want to drive into because my subtitle was titled misunderstood mercy cain is told by god you're going to be a fugitive in a vagabond and cain repeats it this is not fair for i will be sent out from the face of the earth and from thy presence and i will be a fugitive of the vagabond and whoever finds me will slay me and so if you just follow with me it looks as if god yielded to cain it looks as if god yielded to cain's wisdom because he says no no i won't let that happen it's as if god said you're right i whoever slays cain i will take vengeance on him sevenfold and he put a mark and the mark of the beast was to protect cain because cain was going to still serve god's purpose so he put a mark on him and with cain's understanding the mark was his protection oh now you see the world council of churches and the mark of the beast it's going to believe that the mark is the protection it'll be believed by the false vine that the mark of the beast is going to be their protection amen to believe this false system and unify under this false system of world religions will actually be a protection when brother vance said everything started in genesis he was absolutely right it all started right here friends so the mark that god put on him and cain you have to think like cain and cain cain just protested to god this is not fair this will happen this will happen this will happen and whoever will fire me will slay me and god says i'm not going to let that happen amen whoever slays thee i'll take vengeance on them now he's standing up for cain and now he puts a mark on cain to protect cain and then cain goes out and he has any any any and he has uh a son and then he buildeth the city in this term to build at first he goes to the land of nod and nod means wondering so he's a fugitive he's unstable him and no security he's he's a vagabond he has no stability amen he's a wandering and he goes to the land of wandering and in the land of wandering amen he he has a son and he builds a city and it said uh let me read this again and cain knew his wife and she verse 17 and conceived and bear enoch and he builded a city this word builded means to establish to cause to continue cain is working in his own intellect and reasoning opposite to the judgment of god because god says you'll be a fugitive wandering waving teetering tottering and a vagabond moving to and fro and cain protested all of that got god to stand up for him and give him protection and then he went out and he established us he builded a city to build means to establish our cost to continue and now what he's doing is the opposite of what god said would happen to him i i hope this i hope what i'm saying begins to sink in we always look at things a certain way but then god comes and opens the word and we see it a different way you could see now how cain could be justified by the mercy of god cain could feel justified like he was correct because god agreed with his protest gave him protection put a mark upon him to protect him and then he goes out and seemingly the curse takes no effect because now he begins to establish civilization in cities and now it looks as though what god said now it looks as though his protest changed the entire mind of god but god was not looking at stability and security in the carnal sense the same way cain was looking at it he was looking at security and stability coming from those by revelation would be attached to his word and that would be their security and that would be their steadiness and that would be their protection and cain would never have that stability he would always wonder from doctrine to doctrine and man's idea to man's idea and knew god to new god another idea to other idea amen but the children of god would have the word of god as stability and security because they would have it by revelation so he was a vagabond amen and he was a fugitive and a vagabond outside the presence of god amen where where seth's line they begin to call on the name of god says line at the same time they begin to call upon the name of god amen they were not listen they were not just saying there's a god amen it wasn't as though cain continued to worship cain continued to be religious cain continued to worship god but he worshiped god his way and he became unstable in that worship he became faltering and teetering and wandering and now he would incorporate other gods and begin to worship son and worship moon amen and worship other things and then he began to make idols what was he he was unstable he was a fugitive in a bag of vagabond outside the presence of god and he continued to worship god but he worshiped the god of his own heart his own imagination of his own design but seth began to call upon the name of the lord he didn't want to worship god he wanted to know god he didn't it wouldn't begin to call on the name of the lord and when you speak name you start to speak of a person or a personal contact or a personal presence and now as a cain cain went off creating his own stability his own security amen and he moved off in the mercy of god that allowed him to continue on the earth and under that mercy god let him go and now god lets him do his own thing and now carnally he brings security and he brings stability because that's what religion does religion carnally brings stability and brings security outside the presence of god but that religion is always teetering wondering now cain he worships god but seth calls upon the name of the lord now seth knows he has a lord but he wants to know that lord personally by name by presence this is the difference in the two vines now let's go on and keep reading here let's go down to verse 19. we're in the linea lineage of cain this is king's line and and lamech took unto him two wives the name of the one was ada and the name of the other was zela and the aid aboard jabel he was the father of such as dwell in tents and of such as have cattle and his brother's name was jubal he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ in zealous she also bore tubal kane an instructor of every artificer and brass and iron and the sister of tubal kane was naama and lamech said unto his wives ada and zela hear my voice ye wives of lamech hearken unto my speech for i have slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my hurt if cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly lamech seventy and sevenfold now lamech is looking back at cain who killed abel but had the protection of god and when cain kills a man he feel or when lamech kills a man he feels justified in his killing because he i killed a man to my wounding this man wounded me and i kill him he feels justified and in his self-justification he points back to cain and the protection that god gave cain and said if he give cain protection seven fold he will give it to me seventy times or seventy-four now i want to ask you do you think lamech thought cain was wrong do you think lamech thought cain was cursed of god do you think lamech thought that they were in the wrong line and then the wrong seed doing the wrong thing or do you think under deception of devils that lamech thought he was in the right line and the rice's look at what they were accomplishing friends they were supposed to be fugitives and vagabonds and now just a couple generations later they are those who play the harps and play the ark uh the organs they are those who are artificers of metal and brass all of a sudden they are building a tremendous civilization and they are bringing stability in walled cities they are bringing science and arts and they could look at poor seth lineage out there and they're just humble farmers and herdsmen and they're just out there you know they're just they're separated by a little groupie here a little family group over there and little this and they're still doing the same thing they've been doing for generations they haven't advanced amen and seth's line looks like the wanderers seth's line looks like the fugitives and the vagabonds because they just follow the herd from place to place when lamech says if cain is even they should have been ashamed at what happened but now he's looking back at that as a blessing and he's invoking the same blessing tenfold upon himself seth line were now seemingly the ones under the curse didn't have a big church building then have a big city [Music] didn't have any power didn't have any might they were following the herds around living in caves and tents of whom the world was not worthy humble submissive to god they were wandering upon the earth but they were established in their relationship with god they were secure they were solid they had the atonement for their day they knew what abel offered and why abel offered it they were secure with god they were seeking and calling upon the name of the lord amen they were they were secured by god but cain's line was secured by intellect and reasoning and wisdom i want to ask you do you believe more now than you did before that everything started in genesis and then brother branham knew what he was talking about the same spirits that were there are the same spirits working today there's not new spirits so now lamech even in his testimony he's testifying that that that blessing that's on cane i'm bringing that same blood that blessing is following this line and they're in the b system this is the trail of the serpent as it's moving through genesis and they're in this they are the trail of the serpent they are the the beast system that's moving down through but they believe they're right and now my first part of my subtitle was misunderstood mercy and now the mercy that god granted unto cain and the mark that he put on him and then the seemingly the blessings that were heaped upon them in science and art and his civilization became a misunderstood mercy because god sends the reign on the just and the unjust god says the rain on the just and the unjust amen and just because the rain comes and just because there's blessings that come is no indication that you're wheat because the blessings from god come on the tares too and make them grow so now there's there's a misunderstood mercy and that mercy that god granted and that mark that he put and the civilization that they built and the blessings that are coming from that civilization hey listen friends there was blessings that came from civilization farming and crops and trade and all the goods and all the sciences and all the arts it was improving life upon the earth for them and they were becoming more stable and more secure but they were vagabonds and and fugitives from the presence of god so now they they continued to move on down through until lamech now is evoking the same blessing but he's in sin he's in violence he's in murder and because he's in the system that he thinks is right he believes god will protect him praise god and christ is the mystery of god revealed see what's the denomination trying to do exalt itself like lucifer they so called themselves the church the bride which they are in revelation 17 as i spoke of the false bride above christ's little flock the bride lucifer thinks and exalts himself above the humble word of god's truth by the knowledge of the revelation and has placed himself by a seminary education and theology until they have got themselves up and if you don't belong in their group then you are an outwash right back to genesis again see he says lucifer i want to repeat this statement lucifer thinks and exalts himself above the humble word of god's truth by the knowledge of the revelation the simple word of god's truth is revealed by the knowledge of the revelation and he exalts himself above that by his own wisdom in schools like lucifer did in the beginning to the people just exactly what lucifer said to eve surely god will receive us we feed the poor that's good surely he will receive us we are a great denominational we are a beautiful church why look at our great buildings look at our great membership we stand in millions surely god will not turn that group down this is cain's line building cities and what do you think they had in those cities temples places of worship seth and seth's line had no temple they had no beautiful building with embroidered artwork with gold they had none of the the beautiful things that keynes line built for the worship of god they didn't have the they didn't have all the metals and the crafts that metals could produce and the cutting instruments and the tools that would come from metal so they could build beautiful walled cities but inside the beautiful walled city would be a structure for worship amen and so you can see how cain's line would very quickly begin to believe that they are righteous that they are okay with god that god's blessings are upon us and that we are fine and they can look at seth's line and seth has no temple he has no beautiful altar he has no nothing visible that would show you that he is stable with god surely he will receive us we are a beautiful church why look at our great buildings look at our great membership we stand in the mirror and surely god will not turn that group down the same thing that cain did brought in the pretty fruits from the ground that he had tilled and toiled and worked and brought in the fruits and rejected the humble blood of the lamb god have mercy that men and women will not think i'm saying this to exalt something or some personal revelation or something i'm only telling you the truth can't you see what they're doing i speak it loud and harsh but you've got to drive a nail till it clenches if it's going to do any good see till you see it now saying to the people surely you mean to tell me that our great catholic church has stood all this time our great methodists and all look at our forefathers see but they broke the word of the lord and eve was god's one of his she was a byproduct of adam and because she doubted one word of god's word it did it and here is lucifer at his job again today listen lucifer's at his job again today but i want you to find out what his job is because he's going to tell us and remember the antichrist is not communism the antichrist is so close like the real thing to deceive the very elective possible jesus said matthew 24 the elected if it was possible lucifer again lucifer again is breaking god's unity in man that's lucifer's job to break the unity between god and man and god brought a revelation to bring an atonement that would bring an at one minute with man and this is why lucifer is trying to keep man away from the atonement and the only way to the atonement in this day is by divine revelation so he's trying to keep man from the atonement because he's breaking god's unity with man lucifer again is breaking god's unity in man by his limiting the word of god to his reasonings what he thinks that's right and what he thinks he breaks the word of god and the same thing he did in the days of jesus and jesus said you by your traditions has made the word of god of no effect and the denominations by their organized intellectual reasonings has made god's word of no effect upon the people that's right they just can't see it then they say where is the god of the bible he's right here he's the bible that's what he is where is god he's the word they want to see another red sea parted amen and they failed to see that the god who parted the red sea is the god who took off the seals and where is the god of the bible he is right here he is the one who wrote the bible he is the one who come down to reveal the bible amen it's god of the bible he is the word where is god can you not see him in the revelation of this hour do you not see the mighty god unveiled where is god i i want to see another ark i want to see another fire come down upon the altar on on a mount showdown i want to see another parting of the red sea i want another see this i want to see another that when god is standing right in our midst and he's breaking the word open amen and he's breaking it open day by day by day by revelation amen and now you say where is god i want to see god when the lamb takes the book he breaks the seal now do you see god hey amen let's go to genesis chapter six and i'm not even halfway through friends we're gonna have to save some for wednesday i believe genesis chapter six and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them but the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair they took them wives of all they chose the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for he is also he also is flesh yet his day shall be a hundred and twenty years now all of a sudden god puts a mark upon cain this is the mark of the beast that's why brother branham said this is very very critical brother branham says when you refuse the holy ghost you've already received the mark of the beast because that's exactly what cain did cain refused the holy spirit what's the holy spirit it's the life of god god was standing there talking to him do this and he refused the holy ghost he refused god and so you take the mark of the beast and now to refuse the holy ghost is to take the mark of the beast but under this mark because he had in his mind a wisdom that put him on an equal level with god you know if you're going to debate with somebody then you feel like you're on an equal level with them if you come in contact with somebody who's an absolute expert on a situation on a on an issue and they tell you this is the problem you say okay let's fix it but if you have another idea that you think is better it shows that you're operating on a position of some sort of equality because then you begin to debate like if the mechanic looks at me and says you know this is the problem with your car i say fix it i mean he could be ripping me off but i'm not going to argue with him but if he comes to fix my air conditioning unit and he says i think this is i then we're going to go toe to toe and say i know i think you're wrong because that's the work that i used to do so you can see cain now he he believes now now he believes that he's got a justifiable uh right of protest that something's not right in what god said and god seemingly capitulates i hope you can see this in the word and and sticks up for him gives him the mark sends him out and promised he'd be a fugitive in a vagabond but every measure he and his descendants take are an absolute contrast to what was looked like the curse of god and begin to establish themselves upon the earth and establish civilization in walled cities and temples and strict forms of worship and all of these things and trade and commerce and goods and the moving of commerce and they established they established themselves upon the earth and it looked like now god perhaps has changed his mind about cain i hope that makes sense so they begin to believe that they're the right line the correct line and it's so deceptive that the sons of god begin to get attracted by this and they begin to see the daughters of man that they're beautiful but they're fair and they begin to take unto them wives now cain cain could make all the scientific achievements he wanted to and god let him go is that true cain could build all the cities he wanted to he could create metallurgy he could create music he could do anything that they wanted to do and god left him alone but the minute that deception began to creep into the righteous line now god is going to take action and they begin to misunderstand the mercy of god and the blessings god they went out from the presence of god god no longer dealing with them but there's certain laws established in the earth there's certain things that god has set up and they begin to work in those laws and they begin to work in that earth they begin to dig into the soil and they begin to excavate and they begin to create and god leaves them alone because his presence is no longer with them and as long as they do their own thing amen god lets them go but the minute this deception begins to suck in his children amen and the hybridization starts to come in amen and the righteous line becomes gets polluted and now there's a mixing together now god comes on the scene and says i will not let this continue amen i tell you there was such a deception upon the earth through the church ages amen such a mixing such a beautiful form of worship and intellectualism in schools and books and bibles and seminaries there is such a beautiful form of worship that the children of god amen they kept getting sucked back into this thing they kept getting they kept getting pulled back in amen and it looked right amen it looked like it was blessed of god i mean how else could you build a school and have so many converts and how could you sweep through a place with a revival and totally change the inhabitants over and the children of god are always confused by this but in the end of the ages god has come down and he says no more amen this is the time that my children are not going to get sucked into that thing anymore amen because brother branham brother he starts speaking he starts saying now you see what happened in luther you see what happened in wesley fallen angels come in they took it to a form of religion god they died god turned to this one they died god turned to this one amen they died and then he says now you see why the seals had to come open because god's going to rescue his children from this system the whole purpose of the opening of the seals friends was to rescue you and i from this system in this system it's more listen the system is more than baptist and catholic and pentecostal and blah blah blah it's more than that it's a mentality amen it's a mode of thinking it's an intellectual approach amen it is a covering that'll cover us from the judgments of god it's a form of worship it's an order that we can step into in stepping into that order we can become to feel secure so secure that we can be outside the presence of god and be fine and the seals come open to free us from that system the bridegroom is here himself to make sure the bride doesn't go into this system if we make the message another system we fall into the same error if we if we find comfort in the fact that i believe god sent a prophet and that he wants us to have some semblance of holiness but my definition could be different than your definition and then he wants us baptized in jesus name and he wants us to go to church and pray our tithes and all of those things are good and those are works of righteousness but true righteousness is by imputation by faith not by just repeating if we're if we're not careful we can make the message a church order and our children can take the message as a church order and they begin to dress right talk right come to church pay the tithe and believe god sent a prophet get baptized in jesus name but when it comes to let's say this way when it comes to calling on the name of the lord they're too comfortable in the system to need to call on the name of the lord there's a security that has come a stability a security that has come because i can do all these things but seth was not secured in a walled city seth was not secured in arts and sciences and in advancement he wasn't secured in an army he wasn't secured in all that seth security was calling on the name of the lord our security can only come from a personal individual one-on-one relationship with god what is the new birth it's jesus christ revealed personally to you it's an experience where you have connected with the living god and you know that you've connected with the living god and now systems don't matter churches rise churches fall ministries come ministries go you understand not that those things don't grieve not that those things don't hurt not that not that separation then people come in and people go out and people stay awhile people leave people come they show up church grows church shrinks you understand that's none of that is our stability a minister believes a minister doesn't believe loves the message hates the message if your stability was in the system when the head of your system walks away and says no it's all false you walk away too because you were in the system see what we're trying to do is take the cover a lot off so that the devil's exposed if we expose him in the catholics how do i where's the deception that's all around the bride that's so close i could see the elect if possible see the beast system we say rome is the b system and it began the rome became the b system and there's going to be an image made unto the beast now the image made unto the beast doesn't have to wear a robe with a sash and a funny hat and wave incense it doesn't have to be a replica of all the works but an image of the beast is something that's made in its likeness and the image to the beast can be a false system of worship that brings a false security outside the presence of god and you could be in the b system sitting in this church how's that possible i go to a message church it's not necessarily the condition of the church although you can have a wrong church but it's the condition of the worshipper now you can have a church that's totally off an error i'm not denying that but you can have a church in a ministry that's preaching the truth of god by revelation and you yourself and your own mind and concept can be in the system and this is why the seals came open this is why that god sent a prophet not though you can say i believe god set a prophet and now that becomes my security and now my stability is on the fact that all of us believe the same and i can look and see i know god's in your life and your life in your life in your life so this must be the right place so i'm in the right spot and i'm doing everything that i'm told to do and so i'm okay too that is the wrong system in the mind our only security comes from him our husband our bridegroom the word that has come to us in this day to unite with us as an individual not as a church christ came you we can say christ came to unite from the bride that is the truth christ came to unite with his bride but when it really comes down to it if you're a bride christ came to unite with you personally individually and that becomes your security let's not make anything else our security all you could be surrounded by wonderful people you could be surrounded by the elect of god and you yourself could have a system in your mind [Music] and you could be sitting in the system feeling safe and secure and being blessed and receiving mercy and being healed i hope you know i'm speaking the truth because the rain falls on the just and the unjust you could be blessed and have a new home and get a promotion at work and have your little baby healed and all of those things and now the mercy of god can be misunderstood to equate to a relationship with god and to equate to me being seed of god and i hope you understand i'm not here to take away your security i'm here to take away a false security so i hope you don't think brother ted's preaching he's putting us all out no i i think you're all in i hope you're all in but you're only in as an individual you're only in as one unit connected to god that you're in when you as an individual have been baptized into the body into christ by a personal revelation by an experience with god so this preaching i am not trying to unsettle anybody unless you're in a system then i hope you're naked right now [Applause] [Music] if you've grown up and it become a system if if you're born into the message if you just go to a message church i hope that you are so naked right now that you say god would you clothe me amen i need that garment that comes from the atonement amen i need to be clothed in the word by revelation i am naked i thought i was right but i now realize today i'm wrong amen i was only going through the motions but i really have no security down in my heart my security was in my conduct my security was in the conduct of those around me my security was being in the right church or being in the right form of belief i don't even know if you're supposed to use those then i don't know that it just felt good you see systems over there and systems over there and systems over there no listen the system's all around your corrupt mind wants a system your fallen nature desperately desires a denomination that's why we've received the mind of christ to free us from that mind that's why we've been converted because your fallen nature desperately wants a denominational system that i can plug myself into and if i plug into this i'm now okay i it goes back to man wants to find the formula where's the formula where 1 plus 1 equals 2 so that i can just plug numbers in the formula to get a guaranteed outcome but this day this is not what god wants god has laid that whole thing bare because god wants you as an individual free from the beast system out from under the mark of the beast with no security and numbers and no security and forms of worship and no security and and doctrines and no security in sets of beliefs but in an absolute security that i have met the living god and he is my father and he's my husband and i've been united to him amen that the revealing of this word has opened the door to me and i have escaped out of this earth i have escaped out of laodicea i've went through the open door i'm now seated in heavenly places in christ jesus that is my security and i may be a fugitive and a vagabond wandering in the eyes of carnality on this earth with no stability and nothing set up and no denomination but i am so secure earthly amen i may lose this and i may lose debt and i may get sick and then i may recover and then and then i may lose a job and economics may go up for me economics may go down we may have church troubles and church splits and pastors leave the message and blah blah blah and it looks like fugitives and vagabonds but if you've been calling on the name of the lord you're the one who's stable steady and secure a believer's security when he's united with christ moves with him from one tragedy to the next one disaster to the next disaster one heart egg to the next heart egg one one valley to the next valley what what is it what's brought me through that my security moves with me through every valley my security goes with me through every trial amen it may look rough to you but it's not rough inside of me because i know whom i believed in and he is able to keep that which i committed unto him my salvation is secure my eternal destination is secure i don't care if i die tomorrow i'm secure i'm not here to preserve my life i'm not here to advance my life i'm not here to build my city i'm not here to build a form of worship i'm just here to know him all of our desire should be to seek the name of the lord god will see to it that we have opportunities for our system to get shaken and if you've served the lord around this word for any length of time god has given an opportunity for the system to get shaken so you can find out where your real security is it's not even going to come from your family not even going to come in the works of your hands but your security will come from your relationship with him security is not in my religion my security is not in my works my security is not in my blessings all of those things can be wrong but my security is found in my relationship with the bridegroom and i hope that your security is found in your relationship with the bridegroom because he has come into this eden satan's eden and he's come as the white wig one the supreme judge of all heavens and earth and he has come to judge your sin he's actually coming this day to judge your hybridization and in judging it he'll bring you to a true atonement and that atonement will free you from the effects of hybridization and so free you until someday your atoms will change that's how free this judge has made us and that's how pure this atonement is let that be our security amen musicians if you'll come if you all stand with me i just don't feel to go any further we lord willing we have more services if not we'll talk about it in heaven in the millennium will know these things oh i tell you i love him friends i love him that he's freed us he's freed us from ourselves he's freed us from the deception that lays all around us he's freed us from from the things that are so enticing and looks so good he has solely set us free because why why has he freed us i want to ask you why would god even come and bring a word like this today because he's jealous over you why would he come and rip away a false security because the false security is keeping you from him religion is not here to bring you in contact with him religion is to keep you from him religion will keep you from the white wig one because the white wig one is the supreme judge and lays you bare but that white wig one that came a supreme judge of heaven and earth he came down to marry somebody there are people around the message that want to stay away from that white wigged one you understand friends claiming to be in the message and message believers but they want to stay away from that white wigged one don't want to talk about the cloud don't want to talk about the opening of the seventh seal don't want to talk about the eighth day and the bride agent all that is the same subject we're trying to stay away from the white wigged one and now a religious order is keeping us from the white wigged one but the white wig one came so that you would realize without him you're nothing [Music] and he came down to be your everything your husband you're a toner your judge your deliverer your healer your friend your maker your lover he came down to free you because he's jealous over you and he wants you just to himself so i say this morning let's run to the white wig one let's run to him and embrace him and say judge me amen judge this wrong thinking judge the system in my mind i i realize that i'm naked before you but god only you by revelation can bring me to the atonement and bring me back into fellowship god give me true revelation run to the white wig one who opened the seals run through this word because the word is the path to the blood to the life that will reconcile us back to god oh i i hope i hope i hope i believe god will make these things real in your heart that what's so heavy in my heart will become a reality in your heart that we will have him in him only let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus we thank you father that you are so good to us lord god you're exposing every hindrance every trap every while of the devil that would keep us from you god i pray that you would help us to keep seeking your name to keep seeking your faith to stay in your presence your presence is here lord you sent a mighty prophet in our day to prove that you're here and you are here you're still here you can be found if we will seek for you with all of our heart help us lord to drop every form of ritual every wrong idea and every wrong security anything that makes us secure outside of a relationship with you may we drop it right now and may we run to you because you're the toner you're the sacrifice you're the redeemer let us unite with you almighty god oh lord let us come into your presence now may all the filth of the prostitutes be washed away from us under the washing of the water of the word and may you almighty god set us free set us free from the bondage of walled cities and wrong thinking and false worship set us free from misunderstood mercy lord help us to unite with you for your prophet told us that your bride stand on the word and the word only and you are that word and we're coming to you to stand with you and you only be our security lord secure your little bride right now if there's anybody in here who doesn't have that security lord i pray you would go to them now as an individual and quicken to them that security that new birth that reality within where they know that what they hear is reflected on the inside and lord that you would bring them lord by a new birth into the body and united with you oh we love you we ask your blessings be with us as we go from here bring us back lord this evening for communion may we look to what you have done for us and remember it with gratitude because that blood is still washing it's still cleansing it's still redeeming it's still restoring fellowship god we love you and we ask your blessings to be upon us in jesus christ's name amen god bless your friends we're gonna by the grace of god come back here at 4 pm today for communion feet washing and god bless you let's sing as the deep and full you alone [Music] [Music] you does my spirit [Music] please [Music] [Applause] my so
