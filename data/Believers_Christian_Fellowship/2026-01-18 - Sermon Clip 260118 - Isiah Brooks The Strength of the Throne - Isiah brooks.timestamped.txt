[0:00] You got all these message believers
[0:04] &gt;&gt; and you say, "Give me a roar." Roar.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; Y'ALL KNOW IT'S TRUE.
[0:14] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY SAY, "AMEN."
[0:18] &gt;&gt; AND AND WE WE WE DON'T TAKE NOTE THAT
[0:22] SOMETHING'S WRONG IN THE HOUSE.
[0:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[0:28] &gt;&gt; Am I right or wrong? THAT'S RIGHT.
[0:29] &gt;&gt; ALL I KNOW IS THAT WHEN JOHN
[0:32] &gt;&gt; YES.
[0:33] &gt;&gt; saw his name,
[0:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[0:38] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE SAW HIS NAME, THERE WAS NO NO
[0:41] QUIET MOMENT.
[0:44] &gt;&gt; He began to scream. HE BEGAN TO SHOUT.
[0:47] HE BEGAN TO PRAISE GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE. SEE, THAT'S
[0:53] WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. WHEN IT COMES TO
[0:56] YOUR WORSHIP,
[0:58] &gt;&gt; YOUR WORSHIP IS BUILT UPON YOUR
[1:00] REVELATION.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IF YOU GOT A REAL REVELATION
[1:05] OF WHO YOU ARE, WHERE YOU CAME FROM, AND
[1:09] WHERE YOU'RE GOING,
[1:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD HAS SET YOU UP FOR
[1:14] PRAISE.
[1:15] &gt;&gt; GOD SET YOU UP FOR WORSHIP.
[1:18] &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? BECAUSE THAT'S THE THRONE
[1:21] &gt;&gt; THAT SATAN WANTED. HE WANTED PEOPLE TO
[1:24] WORSHIP HIM.
[1:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:28] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S THE THRONE. IT'S NOT A CHAIR.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; IT'S A POSITION.
[1:32] &gt;&gt; Y'ALL HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING?
[1:34] &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD SAID, IF YOU OVERCOME,
[1:37] &gt;&gt; I LET YOU SAT IN MY THRONE.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; EVEN AS I'VE SAT IN MY FATHER'S THRONE,
[1:43] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS HE SAYING? I'M GIVING YOU THE
[1:45] POSITION.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE SAME POSITION ADAM HAD.
[1:51] SOMEBODY HELP ME HERE. THERE WAS NOT AN
[1:53] ANIMAL IN THE GARDEN THAT ADAM WAS
[1:56] AFRAID OF.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE IN THEIR OWN WAY THEY
[2:00] worshiped him.
