TRANSCRIPT
========================================
when they brought the woman to him that was caught in the very Act of adultery they had him nailed this time because she's caught in the very Act of adultery but somehow Jesus could discern and know that that whole thing was a setup yeah right and he unraveled the whole setup because listen this wasn't a debate between Jesus and the Pharisees on the word yeah he wasn't debating he went beyond the squabble he went beyond the tis fortat and he went to the very nature and he started to show that you who want to condemn have the wrong nature yeah amen you're claiming to be standing by the word but you're not actually standing by the word because you don't have the nature of the word and you're not applying the nature of the word in this circumstance listen this was a total setup they found a woman caught in the very Act of adultery if she's caught in the very Act of adultery then they had a they knew exactly who the man was y right but the Bible tells us that they're both supposed to be condemned and they're both supposed to be stoned so right away amen they they're keeping the word but not keeping the word they don't have pure motives amen they're not pure they're not gentle they don't have the wisdom that come from above but this is devilish sensual wisdom trying to do trying to get rid of an enemy yeah right and to do so they'll take the word and manipulate it by their own wisdom Amen to serve their own purpose and it was never God's original intent to begin with so Jesus comes and flies higher than all of that and starts to expose the hypocrisy that's in their heart and he doesn't tell them you're wrong or you can't soner or you're off the word he just says which one of you is without sin Let Him cast the first stone and all of a sudden starting from the oldest to the youngest they dropped their stones and they walked away I said oh God that's the wisdom I want in my life that's the wisdom from above amen that there's no listen Jesus in no way violated the word of God he kept it all in every point but he had a greater understanding than what the Pharisees were trying to bring him into they were trying to lower him into a tis fortat devilish wisdom on the Bible yeah amen right I want that with wisdom in me the one that knows brother Brenham says this I may not know my Bible very well but I know the author very well that's what I'm after friends I think that's what this wisdom is it's the life of the author it's the mind of the author amen it's the wisdom of the author that's what I want
