some of that with you it was really nice and uh we want to thank the ministers for ministering while we were away we appreciate brother ben c but kyle preaching for us and also brother noel coming up and taking the service at easter time so we appreciate that and also today's a really wonderful day to be back as a pastor because i was asked if we could have a baptism today so at the end of service we'll be baptizing carter holsapple so that's really exciting so what a wonderful day to be back you know for a pastor that makes you feel really good so gonna have a good trip report from good things from abroad get to uh sharing the word together get to see a young man baptized in the name of lord jesus christ what a good day to be in church amen amen also uh i don't want to forget to mention this and brother yatzik's church they sent us some things they sent a big stack of small coloring books for the children somebody in their church had drawn a bunch of coloring book pages from some of the stories brother benham tells in the sermons and so that is back out here in the four year by the welcome desk there's a table the deacons have set up and they have all those coloring books out there so if all the little kids if each of you i guess an older kid too if you like coloring can grab a coloring book they wanted to share that with the church also they sent a big pack of stickers and the stickers are really nicely done they had a sister in their church put them together and there's some scriptures and some quotes from the message on those stickers so they'll be all out there as well so if any of you want to go by and grab a couple of those stickers they're really nice i thought they were going to be for the kids but i looked at them they're really nice stickers so so just grab a couple and they they really want you to enjoy that that's something they sent it was really nice they also sent some little pocket cards uh it has the statue of a perfect man pyramid on one side and the cloud and the pillar fire on the other they're really nice if you want to keep those in your wallet so that'll be all out in the foyer so i'll try to remember at the end of service to remind you of that as well but they really wanted you to have that and it was really quite quite nice for them to share that with us i'd like to start by giving a little bit of a quick trip report and share uh what the lord did for us there it was really wonderful we appreciate your prayers we needed your prayers but before i get too deep into it i've asked brother ilie if he'll come but if you'd like to come on up and just greet you and say god bless you and maybe share a thought so nobody likes to do this part but i told him i said we all love you brother you're amongst friends complacent brothers and sisters i'm very nervous uh damn brother chad asked me if i could give a little bit of a report i asked is there any way to avoid it he said well you can try but i've already made the decision so like okay well i guess i have no choice and then coming in here uh i was actually i was feeling okay we were talking with my wife along the way and then when i started coming in everyone started telling me we're looking forward for the test for the report so that made me very nervous so and then brother chad told me that it's it's normal to be nervous and to be shaky but it might be normal but it's still not helping though but if i could share a little bit of maybe my personal side and maybe not to take away from the report that brother chad is going to be giving of course when brother chad asked me i was very shocked and surprised and it was it was very unusual for me because i really wasn't expecting it so brother chad gave me a few days to think and then when i when i when i finally gave the gave the answer i said yes and then god really worked things out and it made me feel better so okay god is in it so i'm feeling good and better now and then before probably the day before we left we had a little bit of accident in our at our house to where uh really we were supposed to have a big fire in our shed but god really stopped it from anything from anything to happening so that really gave gave me a little bit more peace to where i feel more confident okay now now it's okay now we could keep going and then the next day when we show up at the airport we had problems and usually it was because of me and then when we when we when we finally made it to detroit over there there was u.s marshals that uh had questions and they called me by the microphone and i guess it's brother chad pointed out very clear that it's probably very unusual that there's a ukrainian living in america and he's russian ethnicity so it's probably not a really good combination going to poland especially during this time right now so yeah it was by the time we got to poland i i was feeling uh quite not not very confident that i should be there because i was causing more troubles at that point but by god's grace when we got there we drove for two hours we got to the first church and the pastor over there they didn't have anyone who would be able to translate to russian so i was very nervous of course it still gave me made me nervous but at the same time i was glad that i was able to help in some way so the for in the the pastor over there he he knows russian but very very little russian and plus he didn't speak russian for over 20 or 30 years so he didn't uh he wasn't very confident and by god's grace i was able to translate both those services and it was a great a tremendous blessing for me and one thing that i know that i really learned during the translation was that don't put your mind into it just let god god's word flow through you because there was a few times where i tried to put my mind to it try to figure things out and yeah i started stumbling really fast so by god's grace i was able to help help over there and during brother yatzik when we went to the other church to brother yatzik it was it was there was wonderful fellowship over there it was really nice for me personally to especially being over here having a stable job having a good house having a family a wonderful church you really get in the routine to where it's just church family and work but i'm really grateful for this trip because it really helped me get out of that routine and realize that there's people there's lies there's and god is working not just over here but worldwide so i'm really grateful for that and during the fellowship there were many wonderful testimonies that we heard and and then again we went when we went to lithuania i got to visit my sister so that was really nice i haven't seen her for i don't know probably over seven or eight years i'm not quite sure but it's been a while i got to meet all my nieces and nephews and then during the fellowship over there and the brothers and sisters in lithuania very like they love fellowship so there are two times both the nights that we spent over there we stayed up until 2 or 3 a.m so yeah they really love fellowship and during the fellowships again by god's grace i was able to help a little bit with translations and again meet the people and have a wonderful time around the word because the preaching was amazing just wonderful i even told brother chad how why didn't you preach like this at home like brother chad but then again i understand that he takes a lot from what we have over here and brothers and sisters i do want to say that the word that we have over here is so precious and it's so wonderful that i'm very very grateful and i thank god for it because it's god it's god using his gifts if it wasn't for god then there was wouldn't be anything to breach it would be just information and just bible verses that everyone reads every sunday worldwide so i'm really grateful for the word and especially during during the fellowships that we had it was a very wonderful time because especially during the fellowships you could you could ask personal questions or you could ask questions that you didn't quite understand and uh and my sister over there she she gave a wonderful testimony she said she was just really rejoicing from the word that was being preached and she had she had a few things that she she was a little it was hard to accept but she knows that it's true but i think every every one of us is usually that way that some things are just hard to get away from and but sometimes we just need to surrender and let god's work in our lives and correct us by the word so i i thank everyone for praying because i we needed it a lot especially me being a russian with the american passport and traveling all along the border and we we didn't i didn't even realize that we're going to be so close to the ukrainian border i think we were only like 15 or 20 miles away so that kind of made me nervous there for a bit but by god's grace are all as well and we thank god for bringing us home and it's wonderful to be home and may god bless you brothers and sisters [Applause] and we had a wonderful time and brother italy was really good to travel with despite causing us a little bit of problems getting out of the airport but he was a treat to have all the way around and you know we had documentation problems and dating flying out and but i knew everything was okay you know it's one of those things you just know it's okay you've seen god work and it was funny on the way down i was talking to brother elia about how you know i tend to get nervous and want all my ducks in a row and i want all details taken care of and if anything goes wrong i kind of get nervous and i i jump too quick and react but when i'm in missions i'm never like that when i'm traveling overseas because i know god called me there i'm always relaxed cool everything works out and so we're there at the first ticketing station in dayton and documentation's not working out and there's a problem with the system and i know it's like i know it's okay and i'm like why can't i be like this every day of my life this is perfect this is the way i think we're supposed to be as christians you know when you're home things are familiar you have this false sense of control like i've been controlling i can fix this i can call somebody i can work it out when you go to some place you hardly speak the language you're traveling in different countries through different borders you know you have no control and you can't help yourself but i really think that's the way god wants us because everything worked out we got on the flight in dayton uh by the time everything was settled out we were good friends with the guy behind the counter his name's david and we were having a good time laughing together and then we got the detroit and all of a sudden they call ilia's name over the speaker and so we go up there i'm traveling with him they pulled us aside and these two large intimidating officers start asking us really hard questions and i was like what's happening they want to know why are you going to poland and i told them we're visiting friends we're doing church services and what's your occupation and they want to know ilia and how much money you're carrying are you going to ukraine i said no we're not going to ukraine like i'm not even thinking that i have a russian spy with me like a double agent he's got a ukrainian passport and a u.s passport and this never entered my mind and i'm so glad because i'd have been nervous but i'm just standing there like as ignorant as you possibly could be that there's anything suspicious going on here and so i just answered all their questions how much money and why this and why that and where are you going and then they want to know where are you going i don't know what's the address i don't know i can't even pronounce the last name of the host pastor it went from bad to worse but but god was good to us and i don't know i guess they figured these poor guys are too ignorant to be up to anything then they they asked us they said when they asked one question just befuddled me they said are you taking any personal protection in the equipment like um what'd they say body armor i looked at the guy i know he probably laughed later i'm like body armor and then like later when we got through it dawned on me what was happening i'm traveling with a russian who grew up in donetsk and he has a us passport and we're going right next to a war zone and i didn't even put two and two together i think sometimes god just puts his hand over your eyes just so you can go and be free and so we we answered all their questions they were nice and they were scolding us about something and i started saying well thank you for telling me that you know now i know for next time it was like gee that was good you know i took my scolding and was nice but then they were nice back to us and then they let us go so we got on the plane and that was a little bit of a rattle you know you get on the plane in detroit to fly away but i saw how god worked it all out like everything worked out when you're innocent everything works out you're not guilty of anything you've not done anything wrong no matter how many questions are asked or what it looks like or how much information you don't have you're innocent your conscience is free you can answer the questions and i said that that's the way i want to live i want to live with a clear conscience where i can always answer the question no matter what it looks like no matter what and somebody misunderstands that i know that i'm free from guilt the lord has set me free and i'm living for him the best i know how so it was good so we got on the plane and traveled over and so we had trouble at every turn we landed in poland and my luggage didn't make it and so we traveled two days to get there and and um and travel we left here on tuesday traveled down dayton flew to detroit out of detroit over to amsterdam amsterdam over to krakow poland but frank oh he's already pulled it up and i said uh so when i got there all of a sudden you know you're standing there at the little conveyor belt and your stuff's going around and it doesn't take long to dawn on you that my luggage has not arrived you know everybody's gone carousel's empty so i went over there and we filed a report and they knew it was in amsterdam they're going to fly it over and drive it but we're driving over two hours away from the airport so so you know whatever it's fine let's go you know we go out and we we see the brothers and brother samuel was there to pick us up with his wife and his little boy brother samuel valwak who was here a little over a month ago by the yautzik sun so it was good to see a familiar face he picked us up and he drove us over we went i'll show you this map of europe really quick so you can get an idea of where we were going you can see this is poland here and this is lithuania just to the north and ukraine just to the east and then surrounded by russia there so you can get an idea of where we were going and when we got to poland we uh warsaw is the capital of poland but we flew into krakow and then we drove over here right next to the ukrainian border in uh volapee pre piatrova i think you have to ask illy how to pronounce it he he doesn't speak polish but he could say their words sometimes so you have to ask him how to pronounce that so we drove over here to the service that we had service there so i had i just went to the pulpit and whatever i wore from tuesday all night in the plane wednesday and and i didn't look like much of a preacher but we thank god that he helped us with the service there and then the next day the luggage did show up then after that we drove back to krakow over to this other uh village here where where the attic's church is and then um eventually we made our way up to vilnius up here in lithuania so you can see where we travel the first church we stopped at a pastor's name is brother bogdan and this is a fellowship that's that's come together here in just the last i think just a little over a year ago and they've got a nice place they've been renovating their church and we had really nice services there we landed wednesday had service wednesday and then had service thursday evening and there's a group of ukrainian refugees that have made their way over to this church out of ukraine and it's the brother here and these sisters with ilia there was 12 of them all together that are in the fellowship there at the church and like ilya said when we got there they had nobody to do the russian uh interpretation russian translation of the services so immediately they asked ilya right off the bat like we got off the plane we just drove to the brother's house we had a brief fellowship before going to the church and they asked him so he got thrown in the deep end but praise god about a month i think it was or a few weeks before we left we had brother anatoly from uzbekistan come and elia had to go to the booth and do the translation of that service so god had already prepared the way and so he got thrown into the deep end he stood in the back of the church behind the several rows that they were in and and translated for them he had an earpiece where he could hear the the preaching and then he translated and they sat close enough to him they could hear him and they all said it was excellent excellent translation they understood everything and he did a very amazing job so god really blessed our brother and really confirmed that he's an interpreter he can do it amen it was confirmed and we were really thankful for that and they were the believers were blessed just to meet him and blessed be able to communicate and be able to hear the services so we had a really nice time here's one of the fellowships afterwards the brother in the middle there is brother bogdan he's the pastor there and you see brother samuel and elia and all the way to the other side is peter he's one of the ministers there and was a song leader as well in that local assembly here we had on the way back to brother bogdan's house we stopped off at the city center everything in europe is older than america every building in the city center is older than america they're four or five hundred years old so he took me down to the city center and that's brother bogdan and his son there and his wife so he wanted to show us the center of the square this is one of the fellowships that we had after the second service uh it's amazing that you go to minister the word and and like ilia says it's better than at home apparently so you all have to come with me but i he asked me that question you know why don't you preach like that at home i said all these sermons are birthed at home you know that's where they're birthed amen but but all of a sudden god will put like four or five together for one so it's like condensed amen and so and and the atmosphere is really rich everybody was excited and it was a nice time and we we really had good services all through there i think we were there with the believers there for uh about eight days and we had about three days of travel we were there with him eight days and preached seven services so we had services all the time here you can see i'm looking at brother ilya he's i think he's either sharing a testimony here he might be translating for brother bogdan so brother bogdan didn't speak very much english but he could speak a little bit of russian so he would speak russian and italy would uh interpret back and forth so he was busy all the time he helped out with a lot of conversations in fact it was just god who ordained that he would go on this trip because brother elmer was going to try to go with me and it just didn't work out for brother um he couldn't make it work and he felt bad but then all of a sudden in the last moment god dropped ilya in my heart and without thinking i just asked him and he had a couple days to think about it and he said yes and the day he said yes he had 24 hours to make all his arrangements and they all came together they all came together perfect and throughout the trip i could see that that was god's ordained way that it was needful we needed him on the trip he needed to be there for the believers he needed to be there to help me and it was excellent and it's amazing so you go to preach services but you don't realize how much is accomplished during the fellowship it's fellowships like this with ministers and pastors where we're all growing do you gain so much and i gain things for me personally and i gain things for us as an assembly sometimes in these fellowships because you see things from another angle you hear things from another point of view and it really broadens your understanding many times or even opens a door that had never been opened to you before out of the word and so the these fellowships sometimes are just just as important for me as the preaching of the word and so they're really a blessing for the believers over there as well on the way back we stopped by krakow krakow is a uh it's a neat town it's a big city and it survived world war ii most of the buildings did so it's it's one of those european cities that are still intact so where they took us through a trip through there and it was really nice to see then that was friday we traveled the rest of the way from krakow down to brother miatak's place and this is brother yossik's church during the worship service they they used the opportunity at kova they went through some coveted restrictions and had to reduce the number of people gathering so they took advantage of that opportunity to remodel their church so their church is just recently remodeled and they did a beautiful job we had some fellowship after the service with brother nathan remember when brother yatsek was here he brought brother nathan and he sang two specials here and if you look there at the end of the table it's him and his wife there brother yatzik and his wife one of the deacons and his children there and we had a really nice fellowship it was good to see nathan and nathan wanted me to be sure to tell you all he said hello and it's the same thing with everybody we met there so this is the service there by the odd sex brother samuel he interpreted for me he actually picked us up and drove us over to brother bogdan's church and uh they have an interpreter there but the interpreter was going to lead songs that night so they just had better samuel do it so so brother samuel was pulling double duty so he interpreted two services there three services with brother yatzik we had a saturday evening and two and two on sunday with him here's a view of the rest of the church they just did a real fantastic job this church used to be a nightclub way back and so people now hear the word on the dance floor that's the proper repurposing of the devil's building to god's purposes so they made it really beautiful they've done a good job there's uh several ukrainian families that have you relocated to brother yahtzek's church and they're getting established some housing and things set up for them there and this is a brother arthur this is a brother that ilia and his family knew from back in his days in donetsk and this brother was in bulgaria with his work for many years but last year a year ago he felt the move work asked him to move i believe and he and he's in poland and he's been brother yatzik's church for a year before the war broke out and the war broke out and many uh ukrainians fled and and several families were there with brother yatzik and this brother does all the interpreting for them he understands english well he's learned polish and russian and so before those believers ever got there they had the interpreter there a year ahead of time so he could get good with the polish language it's amazing how god provides everything all the time monday we had a day of rest um brother yatzik took us to the city center the town square there in the little village where they're at and we're up on this little platform that's in the city square and he's showing me you can see his hands in the air he's demonstrating that every year before kovad they would they would rent this place out and they would have outreach meetings they would sing and give testimonies and short sermons and have different brothers sing and different people speak and share testimonies and there would be a crowd gathered up there because this is a tourist area in the summer there's always people there and he said one year they have a security camera that you can get online and you can look at the city center square camera and see what's going on in the city center the government has us set up and there were some believers that were watching these meetings as they took place and they saw a cloud come over and descend right over this platform on the camera and then the cloud moved out and went down into the people and there was uh i guess uh that was witnessed by them and maybe others i don't remember so he's explaining that to me there it was really a supernatural event during that outreach meeting so it was a nice day that was monday then tuesday we traveled back up to vilnius so you can see we went from volopia trova over here and then we flew from krakow to warsaw warsaw to vin vilnius got there on tuesday i threw all of my uh communication back and forth with brother vitale brother pavel was communicating through brother vitale he told me that they have a wednesday night service and that they asked me to come preach the wednesday night service so i'm prepared to preach the wednesday night service so monday night before we leave brother ilia he's been talking to a sister his sister lives there and he says brother chad i'm afraid to tell you this he said i think they scheduled a service for tuesday night i said oh lord help me so sure enough when we landed they said you got about an hour and a half before church starts so and of course our flight was delayed and and they were short staffed and uh whatever could happen happen so we get there late and we pretty much just run to get a bite to eat and run to the church and change clothes and go straight to the pulpit but god blessed us it was a real treat for brother ilya he got to see a sister hadn't seen her for a long time and he's got two nephews there and a niece that he's never met before so it was neat to see his sister his sister her name sister rima she was so excited ilya was there she was just beaming and so i had a good time watching how excited she was and how much these children enjoyed italy every time we were near them they were coming over to him and talking to him and getting in his lap so it was a really nice time and so he got to spend a couple days there with his sister this is the church there in vilnius where brother pablo steppenie goes to pastor you can see from the back there and up closer a bit of a tally he translated both of the services we had there we had a tuesday evening and a wednesday evening service and and it was really nice we had a really nice meetings there really nice times a fellowship there as well and then there's a picture of brother paulville and i brother pavel says he's got many friends over here and he wants me to send greetings to you all brother yatzik wanted me to send greetings to you all and brother samuel wanted me to bring greetings to you all brother vitale wanted me to bring greetings to y'all brother dima and then so many others but it'll be it was really a wonderful time the fellowship was wonderful the the times we spent together around tables eating and fellowshipping the times and services we really had a good time and we really benefited by the trip and i'm really thankful that brother italy was able to go because it was so good to see god pick him up carry him over use him for his kingdom and and you know two weeks before we left a little over two weeks before we left he had no idea he was going so god can do things quickly in our lives that we never expected and from the routine of life like he said through getting plucked up carried over to the other side of the globe and used for the kingdom of god can be a matter of what 15 days so for 15 days so no matter what's going on in life god has a way of turning keys that you never expected to turn opening doors we never expected to open and and it's just been a tremendous blessing to have him along and the fellowship him and i shared along the way was really comforting it's just nice to have somebody from home somebody familiar somebody you can just fellowship with so we had a really good time so thank you brother ilia thank you for going along i appreciate sister natasha for being brave and the children for doing without their daddy for a while but we really enjoyed having him there also we appreciate all of you all for praying for us we needed it we really needed it we saw so many obstacles but we saw god open every door one after the other after the other and we could just relax and know that we were in his hand so it was good we met several of the um ukrainian refugees especially brother bogdan's place brother got to spend some time talking with them and also we saw several in um brother yatzik's place and then we went to villeneuster helping out with a lot of the ukrainian churches there so the brothers and sisters here from this church have been donating to the missions fund for ukraine so ilya and i were able to take all that cash with us almost all of it and we were able to distribute it through those three churches to help the ukrainian believers that are there and all the efforts that those churches are doing so god bless you for the contribution and and i know it was a help for them it was a blessing it took some of the burden off the local churches that are trying to find housing and accommodations and and care for these families so it was just it was a real blessing to be on this trip all the way around every part of it every facet was just a tremendous blessing so we came back from vilnius thursday night stayed in the hotel at the airport thursday got up early flew all day friday got home friday evening and boy we were tired and i'm still just a little tired amen jet lag is uh is real it's not a myth it's real but god's been good to us and i'm happy to be here i mean if we all stand i'd like to read a scripture and just look into the word not for a very long time i've just got a short thought some golden nuggets that god's been dropping into my heart that i just want to share with you let's turn to john chapter 16. verse 12. john chapter 16 verse 12. i'm going to read from verse 12 to verse 15. jesus speaking says i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth for you shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come you shall glorify me for he shall receive a mind and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you let's bow our heads lord jesus as we look into your word i pray god that you would come and anoint this vessel lord take these lips of clay and speak eternal words god we've heard of how good you've been in our trip and how much you've taken care of us and taking care of the church in our absence lord as we come together to feast upon your word i pray god that you would make yourself manifest among us by the breaking of bread god may we receive a portion for today and may we go home joyful lord that you're on the throne lord and that you're giving to us the bread of life i pray god you would take preeminence and speak your word in jesus christ's name we pray amen and you can all be seated thank you when we look at this uh john 16 brother branham uses this scripture when he opens the subject when he's preaching at night he's preaching october 1962 on the subject a guide so uh that that uh i just read that that um service i read the book and really really enjoyed it and what triggered my mind thinking down this is something brother samuel valwalk and i were talking about he just made a couple statements from the message a guide and it just really i was meditating on it really one of those things you know you hear somebody say something and it just clicks inside of you and i've been meditating on it for days and just knew i knew after the first day i was meditating on i knew i'd come home and preach it and so i've just enjoyed going through that message so most every quote that i'm going to use this morning is from that message a guide and i think it'd be a good one to listen to or read this week it's from october 1962. and it really has been a blessing to me but brother branham in this message he opens with this scripture showing that the spirit of truth the holy spirit that will come he's also the comforter he will guide you into all truth and brother graham starts talking about our guide is this holy spirit the spirit of truth is our guide through life and so he starts breaking down the what a guide is and he starts talking about a guide in the wilderness on a hunting trip and and how if you go into unfamiliar territory you take a hunting guide and he'll help you find the game and help you be successful and take care of you and help you get home safe and and so he starts to go into all of that and i just want to read some quotes and and share some thoughts from this the first quote in the guide he says now here we are a guide and he is god's provided guide and we're going through a wilderness and we're on our road somewhere and we can't get along without this guide and dare anybody try to substitute any other guide that's an amazing statement because we know as we walk through this journey we need a guide and god's provided a guide but so many people allow other things to guide them in this wilderness of life and brother branham said how dare we substitute any other guide for the guide that god gave us and it's amazing how quickly and easily we'll let something guide us we'll let education guide us we'll let media guide us we'll let friends guide us we'll let family relationships guide us but god says there's only one guide for this journey and that guide is the holy ghost he said if you do if you if you get another guide if you do he'll take you off the line meaning the other guy this guy knows the way he knows every inch of the way he knows every thought that's in your heart he knows everybody that's here he knows who you are and what you've done and all about you he's god's guide the holy spirit and will reveal things to you and will tell you things that he's heard can repeat your words right back and say what you said amen tell you what you've been what you've been in what you've got and where you're going a guide the correct guide and he will guide you to all truth and his word is truth it was interesting in one of the fellowships that we had with the brothers from lithuania we were talking to uh brother um vitale and he shared a really interesting perspective that i didn't think about but he said in their churches they have fellowship with a lot of churches and a lot of that area of the world they have fellowship with churches in poland fellowship with churches in latvia fellowship with churches in russia and belarus and ukraine and other parts of europe and as they're fellowshipping he says all of a sudden you can begin to see when the war broke out you can you can begin to see everybody's perspective on the war depended on what media they were listening to in belarus in russia ukraine poland latvia lithuania wherever they were their view about the war war was shaped by the news media they were listening to and they would have sometimes polar opposite ideas about the conflict and so they spent some time sharing with the brethren there and sharing in the fellowship that that media is not our source for truth media is not where we gain truth and perspective amen because you can begin to see you have believers who believe the same message they love one another they have the the same spiritual goals they have the spay spiritual diet but because they have a diet of worldly media now i would just like to share this with you the american media is not correct and everybody else is wrong right because in russia they think their media is correct and the american media is wrong they are all wrong i would love to i'd like to stress that they are all wrong media is a form of entertainment all right it's the entertainment industry that's why they sell advertising and they want to tell you what you want to hear so you keep listening that's why the story line in fox is a little different than storyline and cnn because they have different bases they have different people they're appealing to so they present the news attractive to a certain demographic who will listen to the news and then it becomes popular and they sell advertising time it's a form of media it's a form of entertainment so it's not the place to get truth this is the place to get truth the message is true amen and we need to make sure that we have the right guide in life that we don't let media we don't let news we don't let co-workers we don't let conspiracy theories we don't let all of these things shape our thinking amen our mind is so fragile do you believe that the human mind is fragile our mind is so fragile and we are so easily influenced that we have to be very careful with what we listen to what we read and what we watch and we have to make sure that the leadership that we're getting in every thought process through life comes from the word of god how we feel about our families how we feel about our work how we feel about the country we live in how we feel about everything that's going on must come from the word of god if not we will get the wrong perspective and anti-word perspective and we'll open ourselves to that and it will begin to shape our thinking in a way that's anti-word so we have to be very careful that we keep the right guide that we don't let media become our guide that our cell phones don't become our guide that the expert at work doesn't become our guide it's amazing that you know you can be a tradesman you can be a fabricator and and you know right brother brian you can be a fabricator and the guy next to you who has the same level of education who's doing the same kind of welding work he's all of a sudden the political expert and he knows everything about the world and how the world works and nobody else knows it don't let him be your guide don't let don't let any of these things don't let the government don't let anything become our guide but let's let the holy ghost guide us in the word and that's our guide amen brother ben said you better stay behind the word the word will lead you across because the word is christ and christ is god and god is the holy ghost i'm going to read that again because that will break up some wrong thinking the word will lead you across because the word is christ okay say the word is christ christ is god christ is god god is the holy ghost so which is which praise be to god stay behind the word oh yes sir stay with that guide stay right behind it don't get in front of it you stay behind it let it lead you don't you lead it you let it go so the holy ghost is our guide and the holy ghost is god the holy ghost is the word the holy ghost is christ these are all the same thing and the holy ghost is the spirit of the word the spirit of christ amen here to guide us in the word and it said let the word go first and you follow the word amen let the word and the spirit of the word be the guide amen not anything else be our god we have to we have to come back to being like brother brandon brother ben said we are not americans we are christians we're not russians or belarusians or ukrainians or or americans or canadians we are christians amen and christians live by the word amen we live in a heavenly kingdom and that heaven in heaven is consistent of the word so everything is the word amen we don't want anything else so we we sometimes pick up ideas we pick up concepts and we don't mean to amen we pick them up through just living in the world just walking in the world conversing with people hearing things that those ideas come in but we have to make sure that every one of those ideas are subject to the truth and the truth is the word brother madam starts telling a story and he talks about an unfaithful father this is in the message the guide and he starts to tell about this and i'll read this brief quote here he said an unfaithful father two years ago in colorado oh he was going up into the mountains he had a little boy about six seven years old he was going to take him on his first deer hunt and brother brandon starts to talk about the unthoughtful father how he he wants to go up into the rocks he's got this little boy he's taking this little boy on his first hunt and they get up there and he wants to go higher and higher and and the little boy's getting tired but his dad's pushing him because you know we want the we want to get to the big deer up at the at the top of the mountain and brother branham said the man didn't know what he was doing because the deer aren't up there amen and so they get up there and it begins to get late and a quick rain sweeps in and the rain comes in and they get soaking wet and then a wind starts to blow across the mountain then darkness sets in and the father can't find his way back down the mountain and finally they're lost and they're cold and the wind's blowing they're wet and they finally sit down and he hugs this little boy to his chest as a little six seven-year-old boy and they're sitting there freezing to death and he said the unthoughtful father holds the little boy as he feels life leave his body and his body goes cold and the boy dies in his father's arms and brother ben said if the man would have hired a guide somebody who knew the terrain knew the mountain knew the signs new safety new security knew how to some survival skills he said his son would have lived but the death of his son was a father who thought he could do it himself the death of the son was a father who thought he could find his own way make his own way that he was sufficient that he was intelligent that he was capable and the son died because he had a father who was self-sufficient the son died because he had a father who was self-confident the son died because he had a father who could take care of things and this son no doubt had absolute confidence in his daddy but his daddy was a foolish man he went into unfamiliar territory he was not an expert he was too self-sufficient too self-secure he was too bold he was too brash he was too self-confident and it caused the death of his little boy but if he would have put his hands his life into the hands of a guide someone who knew who knew how to survive on that mountain knew his way around knew the routes up knew the rounds down knew where the deer was amen that man would have got the game he went after and him and his boy would have survived and come down with a wonderful story to tell of how wonderful god was amen but instead it brought death and and we as fathers and we as mothers and we as leaders in the church we have to follow the guide amen because if we think that we can do it amen we will bring death not life as a mommy and a daddy you better have the guide amen you better not be going through this life amen because we're going down roads we've never went down before we're walking past we've never went to before amen we know we're at the end time and the end time is a very tricky time a very slippery time amen and we see things degrading all around us amen and we need a guide we must have a guide and don't be a daddy with no guide for your family don't be a mommy with no guide for your family because you may think everything's okay everything was fine until the rain came everything was fine until darkness set in and the can when the conditions changed it exposed the inability of the father and as long as everything's fine in our family that daddy's got a job and then mommy's taking care of the kids there's no sickness there's no want there's there's no trial amen everybody feels like we're okay we're doing this we're hunting we're gonna get a deer everything's fine but when the conditions change amen when sickness sets in and when troubles come amen you're going to see your children die too many men thought they didn't need a guide they don't need a guide in my spiritual walk i i don't need a prophet to tell me what to do i don't need a fightful ministry i i don't need anything i can go and find my own way and i have no realize that they're going to have little boys and girls die in their arms spiritually die because they refute god-given guide there's an unfo thoughtful father an unthoughtful mother who will try to lead little children with no holy ghost themselves no spiritual leadership not following the word it'll bring death so brother bram starts to show how much we need a guide how that we're just sheep and men sheep can't find their own way they need a shepherd and what is a shepherd a shepherd as a guide amen and and there's no point in in in pretending pretending won't get get anybody anywhere i mean the world's full of pretenders everybody's pretending they're capable of pretending they're smart pretending they're experts and i mean because you can google every subject and have an answer it doesn't make you intelligent it doesn't make you an expert amen and and so we've we've we're growing into this self-sufficiency because all the tools we have available credit information all of these things that we have we're growing into a level of self-sufficiency that's not healthy the best thing god can do for us is just to break some of our support systems and you realize i need a guide i need somebody to show me the way i need somebody to tell me where to take my next step because i don't know and the and the guy brother bam starts to talk about a story a hunting trip that he went on for his honeymoon and he says i got one time where i thought that i was kind of a good once woodsman you know hunted so much i thought i'm just fool proof nobody's gonna you can't lose me oh i love how honest the prophet of god is he says my mom was half indian and i love that oh my you can't lose me in the woods i know where i'm at and off my honeymoon i i kind of cheated a little bit on the wife i told her you know honey i'd be going it'd be a good thing for us to get married on october 23rd because of course that's when the lord told me to do and i thought now for a little honeymoon i saved up my money and i'll take her over by niagara falls and go over on the adirondack and do a little hunting so see i so i took her and billy and and he was just a little bitty thing and so i had to take her on a honeymoon and it was on a hunting trip too you know so i thought that'd be a good thing to do praise the lord mita was a wonderful woman that is all i can say she was special built woman he decided to combine his honeymoon in a hunting trip because he didn't have money for both and so i say god built that woman very special and i hope she has tons of rewards in heaven amen but but brother ben you know and he starts convincing her i love how honesty is he starts saying i started telling her wouldn't it be good to have some meat you know it'd save us a lot of money we need some wheat for this winter and of course she's like sure fine you know go get some meat and really he wanted to go hunting so he goes up and he starts talking about this place that he had hunted the year before and he was going to go back and there was a cabin at the top of the mountain and there was a little lean to they were going to meet the man there who had the key to it but they got there a day early and so they weren't able to get into the cabin but he left mita and billy and he was just a tiny toddler then left him up there and the little lean to on the side of the cabin he was going to go out do a quick hunt and come back that evening and he got on the hunt and here he's he's establishing his mindset before he goes on the hunt his mindset is he's a good woodsman he can't get lost in the woods his mother's half indian and you can't lose me in the woods and when he leaves his wife and his baby in that lean to and he heads off on out down the mountain that's what he's thinking in his mind i'm a good woodsman i'll go out here and get us a bear get us a deer get something and come back and won't that be fine everything's working out just according to my plan amen everything's perfect but then he he goes and he he's chasing the the scent of a bear and he's moving first he starts chasing a panther amen and he starts following a panther then he gets a whiff of a bear and he moves over the mountain trying to locate the bear then he sees a deer a big buck and he shoots that deer and he goes over and dresses it and he hangs it in a tree and he decides that now he's going to go back and go up to his wife you know it's starting to get a little foggy night's coming in so he's going to go check on them so he takes off and this is what he says he says praise god thank you lord jesus you've given me my winner's meat praise be to god and got my gun and i thought i'll go right back up the canyon here now and said look here look at here boy storm's coming i better get out of here and get back over to meet in them i said i have to hurry up the canyon i went unbuttoned my big red coat and i was running up the canyon like this around and first thing you know i thought my where did i turn off wind was already down the trees lapping together i thought where did i turn off i went around i know i was going right straight to hurricane mountain but i happened to stop and i was sweating i thought what's the matter here i've been gone half an hour three quarters and i can't find the place i turned off i looked up and there hung my deer i was right at the same place i thought well what did i do well i took off again i thought i'll make it this time i just wasn't noticing he goes off again and says i'll just be more careful this time i watched every little move everywhere watching i kept searching searching searching now he's starting to use his woodsman ability now he's went into a different mode now it's not a leisurely walk now he's searching he's paying attention he's using his craft as a woodsman searching searching them clouds coming i know a snowstorm was on the road fog hanging low and then i began to notice i thought i'll go a little further went on and on and on and on and i thought well this is a strange looked like i've seen this place before and i looked and there hung my deer he said you know what i was on the indians call it the death walk see you're walking in a circle round and around well i thought i was too good a guide to ever be lost see nothing had to tell me in the woods i knowed my way around brother branham when he set out on that trip a little short hunting trip to get winter's meat he just thought he would go hunt and come right back to his wife and his baby and he thought he was too good to woodsman to ever get lost and he found himself he said on what the indians called the death walk where you go in a big circle and you don't know you think you're walking in a straight line and and you wind up right back in the spot where you left and that happened to me one time in the woods in a small woodlot i wasn't in a big woodline i wasn't paying attention and i walked in a complete circle i didn't even know it was possible till it happened to me and it was no big deal because all i had to do was punch out into the cornfield and go home i couldn't get lost because there was not enough woods to get lost in that's why i was surprised i walked in a circle brother bam thought he was a woodsman i knew i wasn't but that was a big confirmation for me but he's on a death walk going in a circle and the death walk is that you the death walk is you think that you're going places you think you're going somewhere and you're only going in a circle and he says you keep walking and get more exhausted walking and get more exhausted and you walk in circles until finally you're exhausted you're dehydrated and you die you expire or you go crazy he said many people lose their minds and go crazy that way and he's on a death walk and if you look at this brother ben didn't have a guide he thought he was the guide he thought he was the guide and with no guide amen now he's guiding himself but he's got himself into a death march and to a death walk where he keeps walking and he's being more careful he's using his skill as a woodsman he's watching more carefully i'll go a little further and then turn this time and he goes a little further and makes his turn and he's watching for every place using all the skill he has and mother half indian him and woodsman amen and what he does is he comes right back to that deer hanging again he does it three times comes right back to the deer hanging in and the third time he begins to panic he begins to get nervous he tries to calm himself down he tries to tell himself everything's okay he said but there's no bluffing it you know inside it's not okay and listen churches and denominations and individuals can get on death walks amen where we think we're going somewhere in the gospel we think we're really progressing and all we're doing is coming right back to the same spot right back to the same spot talking about the same things going through the same issues amen what are we on a spiritual death march because we don't have a guide to get us somewhere we think we're the guide spiritually and don't realize that we keep coming back to the same doctrine to the same point and we're not getting anywhere amen the lutherans have been on a death walk the wesleyans have been on a death walk the pentecostals have been on a death walk amen they all started into a death walk when they quit following the guide but don't think it stops with pentecostals we can get ourselves on a death walk if we ever leave the leadership of the guide amen if we ever get self-confident self-sufficient if we ever believe that i know the word and i know the message and you can't stop me and i don't need a guide and then you're gonna wand wind up right back on the death march and come right back to the same thing and the whole time then you start off again and say it will be different this time i'll pay i'll pay closer attention this time i'll use all my spiritual skills as a believer and you come right back to the same same issue same problem same thing we don't want to get on a death walk how do you prevent a guest walk stay with the guide there's only one guy that's the holy ghost and brother benham even began to talk amen he began to explain that god always has a guide for his people and he said he sends a prophet many times as a guy god always has a guide but he says it's the guide in the person he said there was a guide in moses moses wasn't the guide the guide was working through moses brother branham wasn't the guide it was the holy ghost it was the son of man working through a son of man was the guide amen but you still have to recognize where the guide's working amen you have to be attentive and say the guy the guide the holy ghost is working through this ministry amen through this prophet in the end time i'm going to follow that message i'm going to follow that prophet because that's the guide amen the god also works through his fivefold ministry he works through gifts amen and he guides us church it's not the ministry it's the guide we have to be able to recognize the guide so so many people have wanted to go their own way they don't want a prophet because it's too restricting they don't want a fightful ministry because the fifo ministry has failed hey hey listen the fifo ministries failed and they're going to fail again but it's still god's provided way it doesn't mean that i can now make my own spiritual journey without any kind of guidance with no shepherd at all god is the great shepherd and he works through shepherds god's the great guide and he works through men to be guides and he guides us individually as the spirit that speaks to us and gives us individual leadership and he has to be that kind of guide all the way around for us if not we're going to we're going to cast aside the fivefold ministry because they make mistakes and and now i'm going to guide myself and you don't realize you're on a great big death march coming right back never progressing in the word never going anywhere but malachi 4 never leaving amen the circle of god senate prophet malachi 4. look at the signs and wonders look at all that was given to us we have 1200 tapes amen but never actually following the guide and going to where the prophet was pointing to he was pointing in a direction but the guide will take you in that direction amen but if you don't allow the guide to take you in that direction you keep circling back around the signpost and saying there's a signpost there's a signpost look at that look at that god sent a sign god sent a gift god god sent a message but we need the bad we we need to have confidence in the guide that god gave us that the holy ghost will lead us through according to his provided way that we don't have to change the scriptures because things have gone wrong in the past because then we start to take our own ideas about things and so brother branham here thought he was the guide didn't take a guide he was too good a woodsman to ever need a guide amen sometimes i think it's more dangerous to be a good woodsman than to be a bad one because a bad one would have waited for the friend or hired a guide right and sometimes it's dangerous to be too spiritual to be too spiritual amen because you can become so spiritual that you don't realize you still need a guide we can become so spiritual that we become self-sufficient the minute our spirituality makes us self-sufficient we are going to find ourselves in a death march amen there's no self-sufficiency in the body of christ amen we're dependent on the head for everything absolutely everything we don't have any thought of our own we can't make up our own way we can't do anything right on our own we must have the headship of christ in every part of our life we must have confidence that god has sent us a guide and the guide has a way of operating and i've got to have confidence in that sometimes it's too dangerous to be too spiritual this is where brother branham found himself in the natural time he was too gifted he was too good he was too experienced brother bram now does this three times he comes back to the same deer hanging in the tree and he says he gets nervous but he's trying to calm himself down he said i was saying it's okay you're not lost he said but there's no bluffing it inside you know inside you know and i'd like to say there's no reason for bluffing it here tonight this morning if you're not sure that you haven't got the guide on the inside don't bluff it don't act like it's all right don't think that i'm surrounded by good brothers they've got the guide amen god can pluck you off be by yourself in a matter of weeks and have no idea what happened to you amen you can't depend on somebody else to be your guide you must have the guide there's no bluffing it amen if you if you all of a sudden have every once about that panic go off in your heart that you don't have the guide amen don't bluff it don't say it's okay get on your face and say god i need a guide amen i must have the holy ghost to guide me in life i can't pretend i don't want to fake i don't depend on others amen i want to know i have a guide amen we saw how quickly the world can change with the pandemic what if the next one's worse than this one amen and there's absolutely zero fellowship you better have a guide you better have a guide or you're going to find your children or yourself grow cold and dead in your arms amen there has to be a guide it has to be the holy ghost giving us individual personal leadership from god himself so don't panic but don't bluff get on your face and say god i must have a guide he goes on to say he heard something this is the third time he hears it and he hears i'm a very present help in a time of trouble a very present help this is the third time he heard it he said i thought is that god talking to me i took off my hat i had my patrol hat red handkerchief wrapped around it i laid it down took off my coat it was moist i laid my coat down i set my gun up against the side of a tree i said heavenly father now i'm getting beyond myself i'm hearing a voice speak to me is that you i said lord i'm going to admit to you that you that i ain't no hunter i can't find my way around you have to help me oh praise god that's where we need to be friends that's the spot we need to be in and stay in amen don't because god has done wonderful things for us he's done wonderful things for us because we have testimonies in our personal life and god's taken us so far don't ever get to that thought i can make it always stay here and say god i ain't no hunter i can't find my way around you gotta help me so he goes on to say i'm not fit to live and doing the things that i've done come in here and thinking i know too much about it to ever get lost i need you lord my wife is a good woman my baby my little boy his mother's gone on and she's trying to be a mother to him and i've just married her and here she is a kid there in the woods they'll both die tonight that wind it'll turn down about 10 below zero and they won't know how to live they'll die tonight don't let them die god take me to them so that i can see that they don't die i'm lost i'm lost god i can't find my way around won't you please help me and forgive me for my own self-centered way i can't do nothing without you you're my guide you help me lord oh what a prayer amen if you want a guide that's the model prayer if you want the holy ghost to be your guide that's the prayer you need amen you need to say god i'm finally at my wit's end i'm finally done i'm finished i can't i can't put two steps together in the right direction i can't get a right straight thought amen my emotions are leading me astray my thoughts are all tangled up i mean every time i try to start out right i do something wrong god i need a guide i can't do it i'm not capable i'm lost without you lord amen and then he started saying god that wife he starts thinking about his own self-confidence and his own arrogance being the death of his wife and his baby i say as a father it'd be good to get down on our knees and say god i've got children that are watching me i don't i can't be a good father by myself i can't lead them in the way that's right god i need you to be my guide because they'll spiritually die if you don't have the right leadership as you as a mom or a dad amen don't have the right kind of leadership those children can spiritually die amen this is serious we got to get down on our knees and say god i must have a guide you must be my guide i don't know where i'm going i can't be a good mom i can't be a good dad i can't be a good husband i can't be a good wife i can't do these things without you lori i need a guide the prophet of god got up from that prayer and he says i started walking this away i said this is it so he picks a direction he said i have to make myself believe it i'm going this way i'm going straight this way i'm not going to vary i'm going this way i know i'm right i'm going this way see the brother of and just got up from that prayer and said i need a guide god i don't know where i'm going and he gets up from that prayer and he decides i'm going to go in this direction this has got to be the right direction i know what i'm doing i'm going but remember he just asked god to be his guide so what's he doing he's doing the same thing you and i do he's doing the very best he knows how to do in the situation and that's all we can do friends really when it comes down to it if you're not off the word and you know you're not off the word all you can do is the very best you know how to do but if you've asked god to be your guide you can rest assured that if you're ever going the wrong way he'll let you know because you're not your own guide anymore he's your guy all you're doing is just going the way you know best because being in no motion is not going to get you anywhere you got to get in some motion and let god steer the ship amen so he said he goes on to say i know i'm right i'm going this away he said if i'd have went that way i'd have headed off over in canada he was going exactly the wrong way listen to what he says just then i felt something touched me on my shoulder a hand it felt like a man's hand so quick that i turned around to look there was nobody standing there i thought what was that here's the bible laying before me god my guide and my judge is standing here i just looked up and right back this way that fog just cleared back till i could see the tower at the top of hurricane mountain going right straight away from it the best of my hunting ability i was going away from it so he gets up from his prayer i'm going to go this way amen doing the best he knows how to do as a human being but he had asked god to be his guide and all of a sudden he felt a hand on his shoulder so sudden a man's hand that he turned quick and he didn't see anything but just then the fog cleared and he could see right up the mountain and see the tower at the top and recognize he was going exactly the wrong way if we ask god to be our guide we have to be confident that he's going to show us the way and we've got to be willing to adjust our course to his every time so he goes then he says he realized the best of my hunting ability led me the wrong way getting real late in the evening then i turned real quick directing myself like this i took hold of my hat and raised up my hands i said guide me over god you're my guide and he begins to realize that there's a wire going up the trail there somewhere a telephone wire that he had helped the ranger tack on amen to the trees so he's holding up his hands asking god to help him listen it's amazing how god begins to intervene for the prophet but he doesn't intervene in a way that it doesn't require the prophet ever to do anything or have faith or move he's got to move he's got to have faith he's got to try to get to his wife and god will help him along the way but god won't do everything for him god will be his guide amen if you hire a guy to take you into the woods the guy doesn't shoot the game for you you shoot your own game the guy doesn't carry you on his back you do your own walking amen and so in this life we do our own walking we do our own caring we do our own trying we do the best we know how and trust the guide to steer us whenever we get in the wrong direction he said he's been looking for the wire he would hold his hand up until he'll get too tired to hold up and then he put it down and shift his gun to the other hand and put his hand up but he would take two steps backwards to make sure he didn't miss anything and now he's walking and he's walking this way for a while arm getting tired you would think you know god is the guide why didn't he leave the fog separated so he could just walk up but god never does it that way friends god will always give you a picture god always give you a touch something in a sermon something you heard on a tape something a friend said he'll give you some inkling that you're going the wrong way turn around and when you turn around you're still saying okay god i i still need that wire i need i need something else to guide me and brother branham's walking through the dark the storm the thick fog and he's looking for a wire that'll lead him to his wife and his baby so they don't die and god doesn't make it simple amen he has to have faith that the guide is going to guide him all the way there it says after a while when i was just about ready to give up my hand hit something oh my i had been found when i was lost i held to that wire i dropped the rifle right down took my hat off my head and i stood there i said oh god what a feeling it is to be found when you're lost i said right down to the end of this wire i'll never turn it loose i'll hold on to this wire it'll guide me right straight to where all on this earth that's dear to me is laying right down there my wife and baby frantically not knowing where i am not knowing how to make a fire not knowing what to do and the winds blowing and the limbs popping and falling off trees i was darison to let go of that wire i held that wire until it guided me right into where all that was dear on earth was to me see friends it wasn't just his life that he was holding that wire for it was for the life of his wife and his child and we're holding the lifeline amen the line of the word of god and we're holding on don't ever let go of that line don't never turn loose of it for anything not a job not a relationship not any don't ever turn loose of this lifeline of the word of god because it's guiding us right straight home amen and it's going to mean salvation for many that are around us amen don't turn loose of that don't if you get lost how will anybody survive we can never turn loose with the word friends brother branham said in the message god hiding himself in simplicity says so it please god to reveal himself and then hide himself then hide himself and reveal himself in simple little things it's put over the top of the head of man because if you'd say why would a just god do that it's because that man was made up in the beginning not to try to shift for himself a man was made to rely completely upon god oh i want that to soak down deep a man was made to rely completely upon god living in america and laodicea has been a handicap for us it seems like a blessing and when it comes to air conditioning and good food and comfortable seats and it is a blessing but when it comes to spiritual maturity and growth i think it's detrimental living in laodicea with all the comforts that are available in america and laodicea amen it's taught us to shift for ourselves but man was never meant to shift for himself he was meant to completely rely upon god and god's great plan had a threefold purpose and the first part of that was to have preeminence absolute full control and a man he did that in christ jesus but now to have preeminence in the body of believers how he's going to have preeminence in a people that don't need him how is he going to have preeminence and a body of believers that aren't looking for him for everything in life for all their leadership all their decisions and everything how is he going to have preeminence to people that are their own guide we have to lose all of that we have to lose everything and let the word amen become our mind let our mind match the word and the word cleans our mind until we think like a christian talk like a christian amen until we begin to dream like a christian let our mind be washed in this word we need this word more than we need news i'm not saying it's wrong to know what's going on in the world we keep up with the news but we need the word more than we need the news we need the more the word more than we need friendships and all of these things that are outside the word we need the word most more than anything without it we're going to get lost and lose our way in the world we live in we're bombarded by media messages constantly constantly without wanting it without even meaning for it you can't hardly get away from it so that means we should be more diligent about staying in the word than ever before because we have to have something to counteract all the wrong information we're receiving all day long all day long wrong information wrong news wrong opinions anti-word anti-word anti-word anti-word you walk through walmart tell me what word message you've got in walmart last week every message you picked up was an anti-word message at work with the co-workers and social settings and all of these things what word message did you get to bring you into the mind of christ from any of that you've probably got nothing amen nothing but worldly ideas nothing but carnal knowledge and carnal understanding and all of these things i we should be more diligent than ever to make sure that i'm purifying my mind with the word of god amen that the word is forming my thinking the word is shaping my emotions the word is purifying my mind so that i can even think right let the word be my guide a man was made to rely completely upon god that's the reason we're likened and the lambs are sheep a sheep cannot lead himself he has to have a leader and the holy spirit's supposed to lead us see when you think about the church ages you don't need a guide when you're in the broad way well marked and well lit with everybody traveling that way going down the religious way the the nominal christian way you don't need a guide everybody knows that way it's the broad way well lit well posted with placards signs all the way down amen you can go that way but if you're ever going to join him outside the city if you're going to ever go outside the camp if you're ever going to leave jerusalem and the broad streets behind and go into the wilderness where he's been sent he's been put out of laodicea amen the door's been closed to him he's on the outside amen if you're ever going to go to the outside to where he is in the wilderness you better have a guide amen you better have a guide or you'll never find christ because he's not on the broad way amen he's been put out amen outside the camp and now we must go to him outside the camp no street signs no paved ways not masses of people going that way you may be walking towards him all by yourself on an unmarked path you better have a guide we're not going to find him in this day he's not on the broadway he's not in the walled city he's outside brother bam said in the message things that are to be said you were all pre-planned by god nothing happens by chance with god he knows all about it it's all pre-planned planned for many generations back so that you could be here tonight so it's all pre-planned your life is pre-planned god foresaw it he knew the works that you would do you were ordained in the good works god knew what he would use you for he knew the purpose that he created you for he knew how he was going to accomplish that purpose in this life amen in galatians chapter one let's look at this galatians together galatians chapter 1 verse 13 the apostle paul is now speaking for you have heard of my conversion in time past in the jew's religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it and profited in the jewish religion above many mine equals in my own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers but when it pleased god who did it please whose plan was this whose desire whose idea when it pleased god who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but i went to arabia and returned again unto damascus so the apostle paul says that he was walking along the apostle paul didn't have the guide the apostle paul thought he was this guide he was looking to the old traditions of the fathers as a guide he was looking to the sanhedrin he was looking to the elders as a guide he didn't have the guide he didn't know he needed a guide he thought he was on the right path he had letters from the elders and high priest to go and take care of this little group this sect of the nazarenes that's causing such a disruption he's going in all his religious duty and all his confidence and all his self-sufficiency and his pride and his self-confidence he's got the right connections with the right people and the right authority he's got everything and he doesn't know that he's lost he doesn't know that he's going the wrong direction he doesn't know that he's fighting the very thing that'll be a salvation but along the way when it pleased god god knew when he would meet paul god already ordained his meeting with the apostle paul he already knew who paul was he already knew the work that paul would do he already knew he was the fulfillment of isaiah you'll be a light to the gentiles he already knew that he would pull him out of the traditions he already knew all of this amen but it had to wait for god's timing and when it pleased god he came to him and he said you need a guide now go into the city i'm going to blind you temporarily so you'll realize you can't find your way so you'll know you're lost and you're helpless and one led him by the hand and he went to the very house the voice and the pillar of fire told him to go now he's got leadership now for the first time he's got a guide and god made it so evident by smiting him lying blind and telling him where to go and then he had to be led by the hand paul now needed a guide the one who was so proud the one who was so zealous the one who was so confident that he was doing god's work he now realized that he was fighting against jesus christ his lord the pillar of fire the same one that led him out of the wilderness and the exodus was the very one he was fighting against and that voice became his guide and guided him to a house and and he told him it will be told you there what you must do and so now god speaks to ananias and ananias comes to the house now ananias has the guide in him and ananias tells paul the instructions that paul needs to hear and paul must recognize the same voice that spoke to me in the pillar of fire speaking through ananias and he had to trust the leadership of the holy ghost leadership of the pillar of fire and he rose up and he was baptized and filled with the holy ghost and then he went into arabia and had jesus christ himself teach him the scriptures paul could not have figured out his own path in life what he figured out was leading him the wrong way he was a scholar among scholars he was a graduate of the school of gamalia one of the best finest teachers of the day he was a pharisee of the pharisees he was the the bright and shining pupil he was the up-and-coming and the ranks of the elders he was uh favored by the elders and there was he had it all but the truth he had everything but the right direction and in all his ability he was lost but god came in due season and began to say you need a guide from that day forward paul always followed that voice always followed that pillar of fire brother branham he begins to tell the story but i want to back up and read one more quote out of the guide then i'm going to go to a another quote in 1963. but in the guide he said i would like to take the next few minutes to call your attention upon the word guide a guide you know i've had some quite experiences in the woods a guide someone to show you around you have to have a guide when you don't know where you're going and being acquainted with hunting in all of the world around i've had the opportunity to meet guides and i'm a guide myself this is what brother bam says in colorado i'm a guide myself in colorado because knowing the country ranching so forth i can guide in colorado so when brother brother said i'm a guide myself in colorado so we know that there's a great thing that happened in the mountain in colorado in 1963 after the opening of the seals and i want to pick up that story but i wanted to go back to the message of a guide and show you brother branham claimed to be a guide in colorado he's a guy and now in the message testimony from the end of 1963 he says and i started down the mountain thinking about that and about 10 o'clock in the morning and all of a sudden just as plain as you hear my voice the voice said stop and turn around and go back and to set the scene of what was taking place they had gotten news for days that a great blizzard was coming into the area a great storm was coming and they were warned to get out or you may not get out and brother bam sat down with all the brothers at camp and he began to explain the situation he said we can get snowed in here for a week or two and and we can keep going or we can leave and they said let's stay so they went down and got more groceries in case they got snowed in and brother brandon begins to give him instructions that day and says the first little bit of sleet or rain or snowflake you get back to quick camp as quick as you can because it'll be so bad that you won't be able to find your way you'll get lost in the blizzard and so brother man was a guide for all of these men and he was giving them instructions on what to do when the first little bit of precipitation began to fall in this great storm that's coming so he goes up himself on top of the mountain and he thought that he could roll some rocks or do something to chase the deer down to the brothers in the valley and he gets up there and all of a sudden the sleep comes and the snow starts falling and he starts to take his own advice he's going to go down to camp just as fast as he can but he hears another voice the voice of the great guide he was a guide in colorado his advice was good advice because not to follow his advice would mean death on the mountain but now brother branham going down the mountain following good advice as an experienced guide the voice said turn around and go back and brother branham didn't immediately turn around and go back he stopped and ate a sandwich because he knew to go back was death he would die back there so he stopped and he ate a soggy sandwich thinking that maybe that was just me and the voice began again and told him to go back and brother branham by this stage of his life he had learned who the real guide was and the guide listen to this friends the true guide looked like he was leading him to death the true guide the genuine guide the supernatural guide the holy ghost christ himself told him to go to your absolute death but he had learned through experiences to follow that voice and when that guy told him to go back he started walking back up the hill to where he was back into the storm further away from camp into greater danger because the only place of safety is to follow the guide [Applause] it doesn't matter how contrary it is to your intellect it doesn't matter how opposite it is to your feelings listen brother branham taught us so many things out of the scriptures how to conduct ourselves how to live amen how to live as husbands and wives i mean who's eligible to preach who's not eligible to preach who can be married and not married and and who can preach and who can be a pastor and who can he taught all of these things out of the word to us and it doesn't matter how we feel about it or what we think about it or what our emotions are how sad we are for people or or how much it looks like he would be such a good pastor amen if he's not qualified by the word he's not qualified by the word if the guide said don't then don't if you go it will bring death and so the prophet taught us how to conduct our lives how to treat one another how to live in our families how to treat one another amen those aren't just suggestions he brought the word to life in our day and applied it to us right here where we live and he's here to guide us it was the guide in that prophet and sometimes what the guide tells us is contrary to our intellect sometimes it's it's it goes against our emotions emotionally we we're we're pulled towards family members we're tugged towards situations and and all these affections begin to lead us the wrong way from the guide and brother branham on that mountain amen no matter what experience he had as a guide and how much he knew the weather patterns and the danger how to get down the mountain all of that was absolutely true none of it was wrong amen but when the guide said different he dropped all of his understanding all of his experience all of his knowledge and he listened to that voice and when he listened to that voice he went to another realm all together he's still sitting there eating the sandwich when he says and while i was standing there i thought that wasn't nothing i just imagined it was wind probably was blowing twisting through the trees and i started to walk on i just could not walk and i thought well i believe i'll go back and i heard it again go back where you come from it said that i started up the mountain stopped and i thought maybe i was getting scared to go back to where i was at because the winds were so terrific sometimes god makes us do things that seems very dangerous and out of line how about moses with the stick going down to take over egypt and everything we find like that that god asks the impossible see so that he does the impossibles that man will know that it's him it's god that's doing it god can ask you to give up a good paying job god can ask you to move to another location god can ask you to break a relationship god can ask you the guide can tell you to do these things according to the word and they may go contrary to your understanding it may be fearful to your human psyche your human mental emotions you can be afraid to actually do what god's telling you to do afraid to give up that job afraid to turn down that promotion afraid to break that relationship so the fear is real it's not something you say well he told me to do it and praise god no you can have actual turmoil inside brother bannon was afraid to go back where the voice was telling him to go and god can ask us to do things that are fearful to us amen but we've been taught we've been trained amen we've got the word we've got example after example where we can look at that and say it doesn't matter how fearful how much anxiety amen how wrong it feels emotionally if the word says that i'm going with the word amen because when we go with the word what god was doing was breathing back to the place of danger back to everything he understood as a human being being wrong amen but as a son of god he followed the voice back into danger and that danger turned into one of the greatest blessings for the church of god to hear a prophet amen be given the right to speak to nature and say storm cease sun come out and shine clouds roll back to where you were and the very heavens began to respond to the voice of a man and in that experience amen the lord says won't you walk with me and he says i would love to and the lord comes down to walk with him and the whole atmosphere changes the sun comes out brother branham said i looked in my hands i was young in every way i was young again i thought like a young man i was a young man and then very shortly he begins to see his wife and she was young amen and the vision then the deer would come up and the animals wouldn't leave him he come all the way back into an eden condition amen to show us that we've this word brings us back to the full redemption amen back to young bodies back to eden back to nature back to everything god had for us but it took a man who had the courage to follow the guide he didn't do that just for himself he did it for you and i and now we have to have the courage to follow the voice of the word everywhere it points us in every direction there's a great blessing that god has for us but we must follow his voice and proverbs 3 verse 5 i'll just read it to you it says trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not to thine own understanding and all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths this this isn't what we need for this life this will lead us astray all of our experiences can still put us in the wrong direction all of our life experiences can still cause us to make a wrong choice years of experience years of study intellectual prowess it'll all fail every bit of it will fail but this word is eternal it'll never fail he said in all thy ways in every way in life see god is not just our guide in church matters he's our guide in every matter in all my ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths in in psalms 37 23 it says the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way god knows the path that he's ordained for each one of us he knows like he knew for the apostle paul he knew when he would get him he knew what job he had to do he knew who what scriptures he was to fulfill he already knew it and he even told him amen we told ananias he goes i must tell him what great things he must suffer for my name's sake god even knew what paul would suffer from ahead of time god knows what's in store for each one of us he knows the path that he's ordained for his walk he knows the pitfalls the trappings he knows the hurts the dangers the blessings he knows it all amen we don't know amen we don't have a map we weren't given a map at birth and says at 10 years old do this at 15 do this all we can do is follow the voice of the guide because the guide is looking at the map the guide has the compass and map and the guide is the one telling us every interchange in life hey if you haven't faced major interchanges in your life you will as you grow up amen and as you come of age you have major things in your life that major intersections and changes i mean marriage and jobs and careers and movements and you have major things that change and shift and turn in life amen and if you're going to go with your own intellect you're going to find yourself at the end of a dead-end road one day and you're going to have to back up and try to start over but but these inner changes in life these intersections in life amen we have to have a guide who's looking at the map of our life and it's the very one who made the map the very one who knows amen what path we had we need him to give us leadership and sometimes that leadership is opposite to our thinking and feeling but i just encourage you do like brother branham did say god i don't know i don't i don't know how to live i don't know how to live in this life i mean can we come down to it and say god i don't know how to be a christian here i don't know what to do today i don't know what to do tomorrow i don't know what the next do i have no way to solve my problems i have no way to answer my questions i have no solutions i'm absolutely out of solutions god would you be my guide and then do like brother bannon did get up and do the very best thing you know how to do because what else can you do in life look at the word look at the examples you have but then do the very best thing you know how to do in life and trust that if you've asked him to be his guide amen that he will be your guide and if you're going the wrong way somehow he'll let you know you're going the wrong way so that you can correct and turn and go the right way because you have to have confidence that if you ask him to be a guide he's promised to be a guide you can receive the guide and the guide will take the leadership but sometimes what we have to do is watch for the guide to lead us so many times we ask for leadership god i can't do it i don't know what to do i want you to be my guide and then we spiritually sit on the patio on a lawn chair drinking lemonade waiting for god to do something that's not what it means to be a guide what it means is god all i know to do is the very best i know to do if i'm wrong please change me correct me i want to go your way but i can't find it on my own all i know to do is this next step would you please if i'm wrong correct me the scripture says thyroid and thy staff they comfort me they comfort me i'm comforted in the fact that i've got a guide and i've given my life to a great shepherd and if i get off the path i have asked him before to rebuke and chasten me quickly lord because what i want to be is on the path and we have confidence that we have a good shepherd and he's got a rod and that rod is our comfort his rod my staff they comfort me let's look at psalms 23 together psalms 23. and verse 1. we're going to read the whole psalm the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death how did you get into the valley of the shadow of death by following the shepherd sometimes the shepherd will lead you to the valley of the shadow of death but if the shepherd led you there then you can read the rest of the scripture see yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointes my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever do you have a shepherd does he lead you beside still waters does he restore your soul does he sometimes lead you in the valley of the shadow of death yes but take courage you have a shepherd you've given your life to the shepherd and the great guide is with you you're never alone you never have to figure out life by yourself you know i have i have struggled and struggled and struggled as a human being because uh my parents divorced when i was just a young child five years old my parents divorced and and i was just with my mom and i spent very little time with my dad just every other weekend and then my dad passed away when i was 18 years old and and i've struggled with the fact that i really never had a father daily in my life and my dad died when i was 18 and i had nobody to go to nobody to turn to by the time that i i come to be a pastor brother lonnie was already passed away i couldn't go to him there was nobody to talk to and i felt like all my life i've never had a father but then i realized all my life i've always had a father all my life the devil will try to give me a pity party you know feel sorry for yourself kind of you've never had a dad and the truth is so many things i had to figure out all by myself so many things i had to figure out on my own nobody to lead me nobody to tell me nobody to help me amen but i found in every turn there was a guide there amen god led me god preserved me even when i wasn't serving him i see where the turn in the road came at the right time there's been a shepherd watching over me there's been a guide in my life before i even recognized that he was watching over me and it doesn't matter what happens i have a father god is my father he's my guide when i don't know what to do there's one right here with me that knows exactly what to do when i don't know how to make the decision when i don't know how to make the turn when i don't know how to figure out this complicated situation one thing i know for sure that there's a guide here amen and whenever he wants he can put his hand on my shoulder and open up the fog until he does i'm going to keep walking the best way i know to walk and trust that there's one walking with me that knows how to guide my footsteps listen i don't care what you came through i mean i do care i don't mean it that way that was really bad but no matter what you've come through if you've been abandoned lived single not had an earthly parent or not had a father amen none of that would have helped you make it to glory anyways none of that would have brought you into an eternal heritage only the guide would do if these earthly things have failed us and many of us have had failures in the earthly realms if the earthly has failed you the heavenly will not never has and never will if you find yourself alone and you find yourself confused and you find yourself amen not knowing which way to turn and then realize that i've given my life over to a guide there is a guide there's a man here who can turn on the light there's somebody who can touch my shoulder there's somebody who can part the fog there's somebody can help me get to the lifeline there is a way there is a intelligence there is a shepherd i am not on my own the devil plays with our minds and twists us up so bad where we feel sorry for ourselves we feel alone we feel abandoned we feel rejected amen we've never been abandoned we've never been rejected we've never been alone we only felt that way but if we'll let the water of the word wash our minds we'll get over a victim mentality and realize there's never been a day in my life i was alone there's never been a time when i was abandoned god was my father from before the foundation of the world and it'll be my father all the way through he's watched over me i had a guardian angel before i knew i had a guardian angel amen we got the we got to stop the helplessness stop the the hopelessness and say you know what i have no idea what to do next but there's one with me who knows what to do there's one in me that already knows the path and he hasn't told me yet but he'll tell me at the right time brother branham was walking trying to find that wire holding his hand up getting tired oh if god would have just parted the fog and showed him the wire was right there the thoughts that was going through his mind the anxieties that was creeping up needing to find this wire but sometimes god lets us sweat it out it's not easy it wasn't meant to be easy this life is education not comfort this isn't a cruise we're not on a cruise we're here for our education about the things of god he's walking along and his arm's tired he puts it down and holds the other one up and backs up doesn't want to miss this wire and so many thoughts are going through his mind he needs to get to his wife and child there's a desperate situation but you know what god's not telling him anything god's not showing him anything but god knows that he's heading right for the wire god knows that his hands up look when he drops it he takes three steps back he's going to be all right he's going to hit the wire while the brother is going through the things he's feeling where is it at i don't know where it's at i don't know how to find oh if i could get to the wire but the guy is standing there saying that boy's heading right forward he's going to hit it in no time amen there was never a problem there wasn't a problem he was headed right forward his hand was in the air he was being careful not to miss it god knew he would get it and everything was going to be all right god's not here to always take us by the hand and baby us god's here to build sons and daughters of god into mature believers that will take him at his word that will believe him that will have faith that'll have confidence in the guide amen we want training wheels all through life god can i have the trading wheels back or better yet can i climb back in the stroller that was the best we had little kids you take them to the park you they get tired they're fighting sleep you put them in the stroller they arch their back so you can't buckle the thing they want out i'm like what is wrong with you if somebody would put me in a stroller and push me around here i'd be the happiest person on the planet but that's the way it always is friends we want to go back to the stroller we want god to do everything but god knows it's going to be all right there's some things we have to overcome there's some things we have to learn there has to be a challenge to life there must be an overcoming there must be a growing in faith a building in faith there must come an understanding to us because god wants to be understood and all of these things work together and if you know you've got a guide then your heart can rest and though you walk through the valley of the shadow of death you'll not be afraid for thou art with me jesus looked at his disciples one day and says let not your heart be troubled listen he said let not your heart be troubling in other words don't let your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me and i'll say today friends don't let your heart be troubled don't let the emotion realm get away from you don't let the emotion spiral out of control don't let your heart be troubled recognize everything is fine no matter what's going on no matter who's in the hospital no matter who's sick or who's lost a job no matter what financial situation no matter who said what everything is fine there's a man here that can turn on the light there's a guide that's walking with us there's a shepherd that we're following the word is going before it the word has been restored the life of the word has come with it amen the great person of the word is here leading his bride along everything is fine don't be afraid god is here to change the situation but we have to trust him i want to read one more quote as we finish musicians if you want to go ahead and make your way up and brother john this last quote i want to read is out of the guide in the end brother is praying he says heavenly father i'm so thankful for the guide the one who leads me oh sometimes father i can't hear him around me i get scared i love the way brother branham is honest he didn't brother branham never tried to have a super duper faith and he never tried to play it off like everything worked out perfect in his life but he tells us he was scared he was afraid he thought wrong he made wrong decisions because that's the life that we live he said sometimes i can't hear him around me i get scared i want him close to me because i don't know what i'm what time i'm going to run up on the river i want him near me don't never leave me lord lord i can't talk i can't preach i can't hunt in the woods i can't fish on the bank i can't drive my car there's nothing i can do without you you're my guide oh let that be our prayer this morning let's all stand as we stand let that be our prayer this morning i can't drive my car i can't go to work i can't be the right father the right mother i can't i can't be anything i can't do anything i can't even fish on the bank i can't do anything without you god you're my god and if we'll start every day with that mentality if we'll live life that way and give our lives and to the guide day by day then we'll recognize there was nothing we could ever do anyway so when we come to the end of our ability praise god we never really had any anyways our abilities were a deception our abilities were just masking how vulnerable we really were so when we come to the end of our abilities we actually come into the right condition to recognize who we really are as human beings we're unable we're incapable but praise god there's a guide here and i have confidence in him he's the one god's ordained god sent in this hour the holy ghost back in the church back in the people to lead us through whatever tricky waters there may be from now to the translation whatever confusion might come whatever fears and scares and transitions and whatever it might be there's a guide here to guide us through it all and he will always guide us and step with the lifeline of the word because the word will take us there god bless you let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus i thank you father for your tender mercies almighty god you're so worthy of our praise you're so precious to us god that we as frail weak fallen human beings with the wrong mind and wrong motives and wrong emotions and wrong everything we come into this life with god you were so good that you provided for us a guide knowing that we couldn't make it on our own knowing that we're just but dumb sheep that would get lost you came as a shepherd to us lord you came to be our guide lord and that guide has come with the fullness of the word in this day with the full illumination the man is here christ jesus to turn on the light god we're so thankful for turning on the light for us situation by situation we're asking for you to turn on the light let us see your word in each situation it needs transition let us hold the lifeline all the way home god if there's any here he's not confident they have the guide i pray that we'd be as simple as brother branham was that they would get down and say god i can't do it on my own i can't make it i can't live i can't think right talk right live right i can't do anything without you would you come and be my guide and god i believe if they can receive you lord with that simplicity receive the baptism of the holy ghost that you'll come and quicken that seed and that you'll guide them in life for it's a promise in your word lord god i pray that you would help each one of us to have greater confidence in the guide that you provided god that we would quit doing our own thinking and and we would quit trying to find our own way but we would just walk and trust you to steer us if we step to the left and it's wrong i trust you just to open a way for me to step back to the right help me just to go the best i know and trust you to lead me every step of the way for god we're here for your purpose it's your great pleasure that brought us here you separated us from our mother's womb you had a determined purpose in our lives and we pray that you would just work that purpose now guide us in it lord we're putting all of our confidence and trust in you we love you almighty god dear god we pray you bless your people go with us from here let us walk lord in your presence every day of our lives and let us always be aware when our consciousness won't tell us you're there let our faith say you're there when our eyesight and our emotions and our thinking and our memory can't even remember that you're there may the faith inside our soul say he's there you're there god lead us we pray lead us as an assembly of believers lead us as individuals lead us as families and homes lead us oh god we pray we give our lives to you and commit ourselves to you the great shepherd and guide of our souls in jesus christ's name we pray amen and then god bless you
