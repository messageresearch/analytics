[0:00] He set me free. Yes, he set me free. He
[0:05] broke the bonds of prison for me. I'm
[0:10] glory bound by Jesus to see. Glory to
[0:16] God. He set me free. Now I am climbing
[0:22] higher each day. Darkness of night has
[0:27] drifted away.
[0:30] My feet are planted on higher ground.
[0:35] Glory to God. I'm homeward.
[0:40] He set me free. Yes, he set me free. He

[1:15] to God. I'm going through. He set me

[1:26] bonds of risen for me. I'm glory bound
[1:31] by Jesus to see. Oh, glory to God. He
[1:37] set me free. And once like a burden in
[1:42] prison I dwelt. No freedom from my
[1:47] sorrow I felt. Then Jesus came and
[1:52] listened to me. Oh, glory to God. He set
[1:57] me free. He set me free. Yes, he set me
[2:03] free. He broke the bonds of risen for
[2:08] me. I'm glory bound, my Jesus to see.

[2:25] Amen. It's good to be with you this

[6:00] Well, I'm so glad that Jesus set me
[6:04] free. Singing glory hallelujah.
[6:08] Jesus set me free.
[6:11] Amen. Let's just give the Lord a hand

[10:31] As brother Chad comes this evening,
[10:33] let's sing the winds of faith. There are
[10:36] two roots
[10:39] that you may take,
[10:43] one by side
[10:47] and one by faith.
[10:52] Take the word of God.
[10:55] Not what you see.
[10:59] What you believe
[11:03] is what will be.
[11:08] Set your wings
[11:11] to the winds of faith.
[11:15] You can fly
[11:19] in a higher place.
[11:23] Do not struggle.
[11:27] It's by grace
[11:31] set your weak
[11:34] to the wings of faith.
[11:39] What's your need?
[11:43] What's your cry?
[11:47] What's your mountain?
[11:51] Much too high.
[11:54] See the word of God
[11:58] and by and by
[12:02] it will move
[12:06] for you will fly.
[12:10] Set your reach
[12:13] to the winds of faith.
[12:18] You can fly
[12:21] in a higher plane.
[12:26] Do not struggle.
[12:29] It's my grace
[12:33] that your wings
[12:37] to
[12:41] wash
[12:45] in the sky.
[12:49] He does not struggle.
[12:53] He does not strive
[12:57] for the power
[13:00] that makes him rise
[13:05] is already
[13:08] in the sky.
[13:12] Set your wings
[13:16] to the winds of faith.
[13:20] You can fly
[13:23] in a higher place.
[13:28] Do not struggle.
[13:32] It's by grace
[13:36] that your wings
[13:39] to winds of pain.
[13:43] Watch the bride
[13:47] in this time.
[13:51] She does not struggle.
[13:55] She does not struggle.
[13:59] For the power
[14:02] that will make her rise
[14:07] is already
[14:10] down inside. We'll
[14:14] set our wings
[14:17] to the wings of faith.
[14:22] You can fly
[14:25] in a higher place.
[14:29] Do not struggle.
[14:33] It's my grace.
[14:37] Set your wings
[14:40] to the winds of faith. Set your wings.
[14:44] Set your wings
[14:48] to the winds of faith.
[14:52] You can fly
[14:55] in a higher place.
[15:00] Do not struggle.
[15:04] It's my grace.
[15:08] Set your wings
[15:11] to the winds of
[15:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this evening. Let's
[15:18] bow our heads together as we pray. Lord
[15:21] Jesus,
[15:23] once again, we're grateful, Lord, that
[15:26] you've watched over us and you've kept
[15:27] us. You've protected us, Lord, and
[15:30] you've drawn us back together again.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God, the privilege to stand
[15:35] with our brothers and sisters and sing
[15:36] of your glory is tremendous, Lord. For
[15:40] we sing in spirit and in truth with
[15:43] revelation and understanding that you
[15:45] have granted to us in this hour. And it
[15:47] means so much to us, Lord, to be able to
[15:49] give back to you praises for you have
[15:52] done so much for us. And God, now as we
[15:55] look into your word, we're asking that
[15:57] you would come, Lord, and that you would
[15:58] speak through these lips of clay. that
[16:00] you give us ears to hear and a heart to
[16:02] perceive all that you have for us. May
[16:05] your word, Lord, rest solidly in our
[16:07] soul, Lord. May it grow and bring us,
[16:10] Lord, into all that you desire for us to
[16:12] be in this hour that we live. Strengthen
[16:15] us, shape us, Lord. Anoint us, and use
[16:18] us for your glory. We pray as we commit
[16:21] ourselves to you and surrender to you
[16:23] under your hand this evening. In Jesus
[16:26] Christ's name, we ask for these
[16:27] blessings. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless
[16:31] you. While we're standing, if we could
[16:32] turn to the book of Jeremiah, we'll get
[16:34] right into the word. Man, I just want to
[16:36] remind you of the schedule of this next
[16:39] week. Next Tuesday will be our midweek
[16:42] service, December 23rd. So, uh uh not
[16:45] next Wednesday, but next Tuesday. And
[16:47] then a week after that on Wednesday,
[16:49] will be our watch night service at 8:00
[16:51] p.m. And so, we hope you're all able to
[16:53] make that. Also, if you've got a special
[16:55] in your heart, you'd like to share a
[16:56] song special, please uh let Brother Mike
[16:59] know so we can get it on the schedule.
[17:01] We always enjoy that night of worship
[17:03] and fellowship and testimonies and a
[17:06] time to cap off the year and look
[17:07] forward to the next year together. So,
[17:09] we're looking forward to that as well.
[17:12] In Jeremiah, let's look at chapter 1.
[17:14] Jeremiah chapter 1
[17:18] and uh we'll we'll read verse four and
[17:20] five. Jeremiah 1 4 and 5.
[17:24] Then the word of the Lord came unto me,
[17:26] saying, Before I formed thee in the
[17:28] belly, I knew thee. And before thou
[17:30] camest forth out of the womb, I
[17:32] sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a
[17:35] prophet unto the nations. Amen. God
[17:38] bless you as you have your seat. And God
[17:39] bless us as we look at his word. Amen.
[17:42] What a statement he made to Jeremiah.
[17:45] Jeremiah, he he says, uh, before I
[17:48] formed thee in the belly, I knew thee.
[17:51] Oh, what consolation from God Almighty
[17:54] that he knew him before he was
[17:56] conceived, before he was formed in the
[17:58] belly. Before thou camest forth out of
[18:00] the womb, I sanctified thee and ordained
[18:02] thee a prophet unto the nations. So
[18:05] Jeremiah was not a prophet by choice.
[18:08] &gt;&gt; He was not a prophet by his will. He was
[18:10] not a prophet unto the nations because
[18:12] of anything he had done or anything he
[18:15] desired or anything he decided. Amen.
[18:18] This was decided before he was born.
[18:20] Amen.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. What else could he do?
[18:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. If you'll turn
[18:27] with me to the book of Acts. If we could
[18:28] bring the PowerPoint up. Turn with me to
[18:30] the book of Acts.
[18:33] Uh I want to preach on chosen to carry
[18:36] the message. So Jeremiah was chosen to
[18:39] carry a message. And we look at Acts
[18:41] chapter 9 together. We're going to look
[18:43] at the Apostle Paul.
[18:46] Acts chapter nine
[18:50] verse one
[18:55] says, "And Saul, this was Paul before he
[18:58] was Saul, and Saul yet breathed out
[19:00] threatenings and slaughter against the
[19:02] disciples of the Lord, went unto the
[19:04] high priest and desired of him letters
[19:06] to Damascus, to the synagogues, that if
[19:09] he found any of this way, whether they
[19:11] were men or women, he might bring them
[19:12] bound to Jerusalem." And as he
[19:14] journeyed, he came near Damascus, and
[19:16] suddenly there shined around about him a
[19:19] light from heaven. And he fell to the
[19:22] earth, and heard a voice saying unto
[19:23] him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
[19:27] me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And
[19:29] the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom thou
[19:31] persecutest? It is hard for thee to kick
[19:34] against the pricks. And he trembling and
[19:37] astonished, said, Lord, what will thou
[19:39] have me to do? And the Lord said unto
[19:42] him, "Arise, and go into the city, and
[19:44] it shall be told thee what thou must
[19:47] do." Let's go down to verse 10. And
[19:50] there was a certain disciple at Damascus
[19:52] named Ananas. And to him, said the Lord
[19:55] in a vision, Ananas. And he said,
[19:57] "Behold, I am here, Lord." And the Lord
[19:59] said unto him, "Arise, and go into the
[20:01] street which is called Straight, and
[20:03] inquire in the house of Judas for one
[20:05] called Saul of Tarsus. For behold, he
[20:08] prayth and hath seen in a vision a man
[20:11] named Ananas coming in and putting his
[20:13] hands on him that he might receive his
[20:15] sight. Then Ananas answered,"Lord, I
[20:18] have heard by many of this man how much
[20:20] evil he have done to the saints at
[20:23] Jerusalem, and here he hath authority
[20:25] from the chief priests to bind all that
[20:27] call on thy name." But the Lord said
[20:29] unto him, "Go thy way, for he is a
[20:32] chosen vessel unto me to bear my name
[20:34] before the Gentiles and kings and the
[20:37] children of Israel. For I will show him
[20:40] how great things he must suffer for my
[20:42] name's sake." So here we look at the
[20:44] calling of the Apostle Paul. He was
[20:46] Saul. And as Saul, he was raging,
[20:50] absolutely raging against the disciples,
[20:53] against the Christians. And he was
[20:54] wreaking havoc amongst the churches is
[20:56] what the Bible said. Amen. And and he
[20:59] was doing horrible things. And even
[21:01] Ananas, when God told Ananas, "This is
[21:03] what I want you to do. I want you to go,
[21:06] Amen. pray for Saul." Amen. And he says,
[21:08] "Oh Lord, I've heard I've heard of this
[21:11] man. I've heard by many of this man how
[21:14] much evil he hath done to the saints at
[21:17] Jerusalem." So here is a man that was
[21:19] doing evil to the saints of God,
[21:23] &gt;&gt; persecuting Jesus Christ as he
[21:25] persecuted the body of Christ. And Jesus
[21:27] even said,"Wh persecutest thou me?" He
[21:29] said, "Who are you, Lord?" He said, "I'm
[21:31] Jesus whom you persecutest. Why is it so
[21:34] hard for thee to kick against the
[21:35] pricks?" And he trembling and astonished
[21:37] said, "Lord, what do you want me to do?"
[21:39] He didn't know he was persecuting the
[21:41] Lord, but he was doing evil. Amen. And
[21:43] Ananas knew this man. He knew the
[21:45] reputation. He knew the evil was doing.
[21:48] And he was he was questioning God on
[21:50] God's uh desire to send him to Saul. But
[21:54] God said to him, "Go thy way, for he is
[21:56] a chosen vessel unto me." I chose him
[22:01] before. When did God choose him? Amen.
[22:04] God chose him before. How far before? I
[22:06] believe before the foundation of the
[22:08] world. But certainly in this text, he
[22:10] chose him before his conversion. He
[22:12] chose him before he was right. He chose
[22:14] him while he was evil. While he was
[22:16] Saul, while he didn't know the Lord,
[22:18] while he was wreaking havoc of the
[22:19] churches and doing evil to the saints in
[22:21] Jerusalem,
[22:23] &gt;&gt; God chose him not because he was good.
[22:25] God chose him by his grace.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; And he was a chosen vessel unto me,
[22:31] listen, to bear my name before the
[22:33] Gentiles and kings and the children of
[22:36] Israel. So he says, "I have chosen."
[22:39] HE'S A VESSEL THAT I HAVE chosen to bear
[22:42] my name to the Gentiles and to kings and
[22:46] to the children of Israel.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Now listen, you know who he hasn't got
[22:51] permission from yet or who he hasn't
[22:52] asked permission of yet? Saul.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; He already told was the rest of his
[22:57] life. Hey, listen. He's a chosen vessel
[22:59] to me and he's going to bear my name and
[23:02] he's going to take it TO THE GENTILES.
[23:03] HE DIDN'T ASK SAUL IF HE WANTED TO GO TO
[23:05] the Gentiles.
[23:07] and he'll bear it before kings and to
[23:10] the nation of Israel. And and he never
[23:12] asked him. He never came AND SAID,
[23:13] "SALM, I I'VE GOT A DEAL FOR YOU. WHY
[23:16] DON'T YOU JUST CHANGE YOUR WAYS AND I
[23:18] THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD? WHY DO YOU say
[23:20] we make a deal and you come to work for
[23:22] me?" And no, that was never in the
[23:24] equation. God had already determined it
[23:26] and already knew what it would BE AND
[23:28] SAID, "NOW I MUST SHOW HIM WHAT GREAT
[23:30] things he must suffer for my name's
[23:31] sake." Yeah.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; EVEN THE THINGS THAT SAUL WOULD SUFFER
[23:35] WITH. AMEN. GOD HAD ALREADY LAID HIM OUT
[23:38] AND adorned him and he PICKED HIM. AMEN.
[23:40] AND THE CHOOSING OF GOD. AMEN. BROUGHT
[23:43] PAUL INTO GENTILES whether he wanted it
[23:45] or not.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; Brought him unto kings, brought him into
[23:50] the Israel to bear the name of the Lord.
[23:52] The same one that he was persecuting.
[23:54] Now he would bear his name and he would
[23:58] suffer greatly for his name's sake.
[24:02] My oh my, God is good.
[24:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:06] &gt;&gt; He chose him to carry the message.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; He didn't ask him to carry the message.
[24:12] He chose him to carry the message.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:17] In Galatians, Paul says,"For you have
[24:20] heard of my conversion in time past in
[24:22] the Jews religion. How that beyond
[24:24] measure I persecuted the church of God
[24:26] and wasted it and profited in the Jews
[24:29] religion above many my equals in my own
[24:32] nation, being more exceedingly zealous
[24:34] of the traditions of my fathers." But
[24:37] when I I'm going to take a look at this
[24:40] here,
[24:43] but when it pleased God,
[24:47] Look at this word when
[24:49] &gt;&gt; that means time.
[24:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; At the appointed time.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; When God decided.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; When it pleased God who separated me
[25:00] from my mother's womb. Yeah.
[25:03] &gt;&gt; So that means God birthed Saul onto the
[25:07] earth at an appointed time.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; Because he SAYS IT WAS GOD WHO SEPARATED
[25:13] me from my God saw after my birth just
[25:15] like he did Jeremiah's.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; And when God separated me from my
[25:19] brother, my mother's womb, it was God
[25:21] who did this. Amen. God appointed my
[25:24] time. Uh God watched over my goings.
[25:27] Amen. But when it pleased God, who
[25:29] separated me from my mother's womb, and
[25:30] called me by his grace
[25:33] to reveal his son in me, that I might
[25:36] preach him among the Gentiles. So when
[25:39] it pleased God to reveal his son in me,
[25:42] Amen. That's when he called me.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD, LISTEN, GOD knew the day Saul
[25:49] was born.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; God knew him when he was conceived. God
[25:53] knew when he was born. He foresaw his
[25:55] life. Amen. And he knew and separated
[25:57] him. And he knew when he was in the
[25:59] school of Galia. And he knew all that he
[26:01] was doing. And he knew when he was
[26:02] wreaking havoc in the churches. And he
[26:04] knew when he was hailing them to prison.
[26:06] And he knew he knew then what he would
[26:08] do. Amen. But he was waiting for the
[26:10] appointed time. And when it pleased God.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; THE SAME GOD WHO SEPARATED me from my
[26:16] mother's womb, but it pleased him to
[26:18] reveal his son in me. Amen. Then then he
[26:21] called me by his grace and he began to
[26:23] to use me and anoint me. God was in
[26:26] control. Amen. God met Saul on the road
[26:29] to Damascus.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; Saul didn't find God. God found Saul.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wasn't looking He wasn't
[26:38] looking for God in that way. He wasn't
[26:40] expecting to find him. Amen. He didn't
[26:43] want him to be Amen. the the He didn't
[26:45] want Jesus Christ to be God. He didn't
[26:48] want him to be the one he was
[26:49] persecuting. He didn't want any of that.
[26:51] Amen. But when God determined that it
[26:53] was now time, when it pleased God, God
[26:55] interrupted his plans and he met a
[26:57] pillar of fire on the road to Damascus,
[27:00] who began to tell him, "Amen, you're
[27:02] going the wrong direction. I've got
[27:03] another plan for you." And he sent
[27:05] Ananas to tell him, "Hey, you're a
[27:07] chosen vessel unto God, and you're going
[27:09] to go to the Gentiles and bear his name,
[27:11] and you're going to go to kings and bear
[27:13] his name, and you're going to go to
[27:14] Israel and bear his name. AND ON TOP OF
[27:17] THAT, YOU'RE GOING TO SUFFER GREATLY for
[27:18] his name's sake.
[27:24] And God never asked him if he wanted to.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; He just told him that's what he would
[27:28] do.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; Listen, we know, brother Bam tells us
[27:32] that God is a gentleman. He never forces
[27:34] anybody. So Saul had to surrender. He
[27:38] had to submit. Amen. But it wasn't his
[27:40] plan. It was God's plan. No matter how
[27:43] much he would have wanted to do a god a
[27:44] service and it's evident that he wanted
[27:47] to do god a service he was more zealous
[27:49] than all of his brethren for the
[27:50] father's traditions he had a zealousness
[27:53] inside of him and no doubt he was
[27:55] sincere and had a desire TO DO FOR GOD
[27:58] because he was upholding the traditions
[28:00] of the fathers which he thought was
[28:01] right and he was destroying anything
[28:03] that came against it and he wanted to do
[28:05] God a service but he was going about it
[28:07] completely wrong because he was doing it
[28:10] his way
[28:11] &gt;&gt; of his own mind, of his own will, of his
[28:13] own desire. And God let him go so long
[28:16] in his own knowledge and his own wisdom
[28:18] and his own ability. Amen. And and maybe
[28:21] God let HIM GO THAT FAR so that when God
[28:23] turned him around, he would realize what
[28:25] a wreck he is and how off he is and how
[28:27] he doesn't know anything. BUT WHEN GOD
[28:30] APPOINTED THE TIME when it pleased him,
[28:32] amen, to reveal his son in me, then he
[28:34] called me by his grace.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, so now the God being a
[28:41] gentleman, he never would force uh uh
[28:44] Saul to do this, but he would tell Saul,
[28:47] "This is what I have for you." And Saul
[28:49] would have to surrender to it. But no,
[28:51] no matter how zealous Saul was for a
[28:53] work of God, he could never put himself
[28:56] in this position. It was God who called
[28:58] him.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; It was God's decision. Listen, there's
[29:01] many decisions. Brother Vam said that we
[29:03] all are under a law of free choice.
[29:06] We're all under a law of choosing. We
[29:08] can all choose and we have a right to
[29:10] choose. And God gives us free moral
[29:11] agency. We choose. And that law of
[29:14] choosing sets within us a law of cause
[29:17] and effect.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; Choice and consequence. Which is part of
[29:22] our training in this life.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; God lets us make mistakes.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; How many of you ever cried out to God,
[29:28] "God, why didn't you stop me?
[29:33] &gt;&gt; YOU COULD HAVE STOPPED ME. WHY DIDN'T
[29:34] YOU STOP ME?
[29:36] I mean, I wonder if Saul ever wondered
[29:38] why God didn't come to him before the
[29:40] stoning of Steven.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; God chose when to come to Saul. He could
[29:47] have come earlier and stopped all of
[29:49] that. And brother Brandham said it
[29:51] always bothered Paul
[29:53] &gt;&gt; about Stephen and he wanted to die a
[29:55] martyr's death to kind of make up for
[29:57] it.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; It was always on his subconscious. It
[30:00] always bothered him what he had done
[30:02] before and his persecution of the
[30:03] church. Amen. And God could have stopped
[30:05] him earlier. Amen. Because it was God's
[30:07] will and God's appointed time. Amen. But
[30:09] it served a purpose.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; So no matter how much he wanted, he
[30:15] couldn't be in that position by wanting
[30:18] to.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; He couldn't be in the position to bear
[30:22] his name to Gentiles and to kings and to
[30:24] Israel. He couldn't do that just because
[30:26] he wanted to or he desired it or he had
[30:28] a strong desire or something. That
[30:30] wouldn't do it. It had to be God's
[30:31] choice. Right?
[30:33] &gt;&gt; So, we can choose many things and those
[30:35] choices God allows us to make for good
[30:38] and for bad. And all of it's for lessons
[30:40] for us, but one thing we cannot choose
[30:43] is whether or not we're children of God.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; He chose that before.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; And what purpose we'd serve on this
[30:52] earth, he chose that before. We didn't
[30:54] choose that. A lot of choices he allows
[30:56] us to make, but that's one choice that
[30:59] we don't choose. He chose.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; Paul also says here in first
[31:06] Corinthians, "For I am the least of the
[31:08] apostles, that am not meat to be called
[31:10] an apostle because I persecuted the
[31:12] church of God, but by the grace of God,
[31:15] I am what I am."
[31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; See this word grace?
[31:20] &gt;&gt; That's God's love and favor.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; That's his choice.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; That's his desire, his plan. That's
[31:28] God's grace. but by the grace of God. So
[31:31] he says I'm not meat. That word meat
[31:33] means worthy.
[31:35] Said I am not I am not worthy
[31:39] to be an apostle.
[31:42] It's not merit. It's not worthiness.
[31:44] It's not ability. It was the grace of
[31:46] God.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; But by the grace of God, I am what I am.
[31:50] And his grace which was bestowed upon me
[31:52] was not in vain. But I labored more
[31:54] abundantly than they all. Yet not I, but
[31:57] the grace of God which was with me. I
[31:59] think Paul learned something through his
[32:01] disastrous first part of his of his zeal
[32:03] for God. He realized that this isn't me.
[32:06] When it was me, it was all wrong. Now
[32:08] it's got to be him and me if it's going
[32:10] to be right.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. SO NOW PAUL now he realizes he's
[32:15] an apostle. And he realizes he's an
[32:18] apostle to the Gentiles. And he knows
[32:21] that he's here to fulfill the scripture
[32:24] because he knows there's a prophecy that
[32:25] he's fulfilling on Isaiah Isaiah that he
[32:28] is a light unto the Gentiles. He says
[32:30] so.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; So he knows he's the word. He knows he's
[32:33] the fulfillment of the word. He's a He's
[32:36] fulfilling a role that God gave him. He
[32:38] is a light to the Gentiles. He's bearing
[32:40] God's name. He's a chosen vessel. He's
[32:43] all of this, but he knows it has nothing
[32:45] to do with him. Has everything to do
[32:46] with God. So there's no pumping his
[32:48] chest. There's no pride. He's realizing
[32:50] I'm not even worthy to be what I am, but
[32:53] I am what I am by the grace of God.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then it's then even in my
[33:00] abundant labor, it's not I, it's the
[33:02] grace that's in me.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; So, I think he realized that this was
[33:07] all God.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; In 1st Samuel 16, we're going to jump
[33:12] around the Bible a little bit, so just
[33:14] hold on.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said to Samuel, "How long
[33:17] wil thou mourn for Saul?" Saul was the
[33:19] first king of Israel and Saul Samuel had
[33:22] anointed him king and he has failed to
[33:24] obey the voice of God. Said, "How long
[33:26] will thou mourn for Saul seeing I have
[33:28] rejected him from reigning over Israel?
[33:31] Fill thine horn with oil and go. I will
[33:33] send thee the Jess to Jesse the
[33:35] Bethlehemite for I
[33:40] have provided me a king."
[33:44] Amen.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; I have provided me a king among his
[33:50] sons.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; What did David have to do with this at
[33:54] this part of the story?
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; He was a lad out tending sheep. He was
[34:01] probably playing a harp when God was
[34:02] talking to Sam. He's probably playing a
[34:04] harp, singing and picking clover and and
[34:06] looking for a good place to pasture the
[34:08] sheep. He wasn't thinking about being a
[34:10] king. He wasn't desiring to be a king.
[34:13] He wasn't dreaming about being a king.
[34:15] HE WASN'T PRE PRE PLAYING PRETEND to be
[34:17] a king. He was out doing HIS THING. BUT
[34:20] GOD had provided uh he says, "I have
[34:24] provided me a king." GOD SAYS, "I PICKED
[34:27] one out."
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Had nothing to do with David. David was
[34:32] chosen of God. And at this stage uh of
[34:36] the story, HE DIDN'T SAY, "SAMUEL, I'D
[34:39] LIKE FOR YOU TO GO ASK David if you'd
[34:41] like to be a king for me."
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Right.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank God.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; There's some things that he has to do
[34:52] himself.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Then he goes to Samuel's house. And
[34:58] Samuel said unto Jesse, "Are here all
[35:00] thy children?" And he said, "There
[35:02] remainth yet the youngest, and behold,
[35:05] he keepeth the sheep." And Samuel said
[35:06] unto Jesse, "Send and fetch him, for we
[35:08] will not sit down till he come hither."
[35:11] And he sent and brought him in. Now he
[35:13] was ready and with all of a beautiful
[35:15] countenance and goodly to look to. And
[35:17] the Lord said, "Arise, anoint him, for
[35:19] this is he." Then Samuel took the horn
[35:22] of oil and anointed him in the midst of
[35:24] his brethren. And the spirit of the Lord
[35:26] came upon David from that day forward.
[35:29] Listen, David, they go and fetch David.
[35:33] David, who knows if he has a clue what's
[35:35] going on because he's been out tending
[35:37] the sheep. When when Samuel comes and
[35:39] tells his Aaron to Jesse that I'm going
[35:41] to anoint one of your sons king, he
[35:43] doesn't even think to go get David. He
[35:45] leaves David back out wherever he is in
[35:47] pasture tending sheep. And he brings the
[35:50] strongest all the way down through the
[35:52] through the first seven sons. And he
[35:54] brings them all down through there. And
[35:55] and and and the first one that came was
[35:57] Ilab. and he was broad shouldered and
[35:59] strong and he looked like a king. Amen.
[36:01] Samuel jumped up with the anointing oil
[36:03] and he was going to run over and said,
[36:04] "Surely this is God's choice."
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; And God says, "No, you're looking wrong.
[36:09] You're looking like a man. You're
[36:10] looking to the outside. You're not
[36:11] looking at what I look at."
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; AND SO HE SAT DOWN AND one by one
[36:16] they're all rejected and he's he's like,
[36:18] "Well,
[36:19] &gt;&gt; is there another one?" SO THEY GO FETCH
[36:22] HIM AND THE GUY WHO WENT TO TO FETCH THE
[36:24] SERVANT WHO WENT to go fetch uh David,
[36:26] who knows what he told him, BUT DAVID IS
[36:28] OUT TENDING SHEEP. MAYBE DAVID had to
[36:30] run to the house. You know, they need
[36:32] you quick, Samuel, but the prophet's
[36:33] there. And he's wondering, am I in
[36:35] trouble? What have I done? I Why is
[36:38] Samuel the prophet there? My dad wants
[36:39] me to come.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; He's not thinking about being a king.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; He runs in there and stands. And as soon
[36:47] as he comes in the room, Samuel rises
[36:49] with a horn of oil cuz God says that's
[36:51] him. And all of a sudden, he begins to
[36:53] pour oil over his head and anoint him to
[36:54] be the next king. Amen. And then when he
[36:57] anoints him, then the spirit of God
[36:59] comes and rests upon him and he has this
[37:01] experience and now he's anointed. And
[37:03] now he he's he's got the spirit of God
[37:05] upon him. Amen. And he didn't do
[37:07] anything. All he did was walk in the
[37:10] room
[37:12] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WAS GOD'S CHOICE. IT WAS
[37:14] GOD'S DECISION. IT WAS ALL GOD. IT
[37:16] WASN'T DAVID. IT WAS GOD.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[37:23] And you know, FROM THAT POINT ON,
[37:25] DAVID'S life changes.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; I mean, immediately he goes back out and
[37:30] tends sheep.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; But somewhere along the line, he kills a
[37:34] bear.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; And he kills a lion.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; And then he takes cheese and bread to to
[37:40] the armies of Israel when they're
[37:41] fighting the Philistines at the bidding
[37:43] of his father. and and he goes to check
[37:45] and see how it's going and and Goliath
[37:47] stands up and makes his boast and and
[37:49] David says, "Why isn't anybody killing
[37:51] this guy?"
[37:52] &gt;&gt; And it all GETS UP TO SAUL AND HE COMES
[37:54] TO SAUL. WHAT'S HAPPENING TO DAVID?
[37:56] LISTEN, DAVID'S NOT LOOKING TO BE A
[37:58] WARRIOR. DAVID'S NOT LISTEN WHEN A when
[38:01] a lamb when when his lamb was taken by a
[38:03] lion, HE WASN'T SAYING, "GOD, UH, MAKE
[38:06] ME A LION KILLER." God just made the
[38:08] circumstance HAPPEN. AMEN. BUT HE WAS
[38:10] UNDER an anointing and he was under the
[38:13] spirit OF GOD. AMEN. AND GOD WAS
[38:15] TRAINING HIM FOR A ROLE. AND WHATEVER
[38:17] HAPPENED, AMEN. the anointing and the
[38:19] spirit of God was moving him and he slew
[38:20] the lion and he slew the bear. And now
[38:22] he comes and there's a there's an
[38:24] anointing on him from the prophet. And
[38:27] there's a THERE'S A SPIRITUAL POWER
[38:28] THAT'S RESTING UPON HIM that when HE
[38:30] HEARS GOLIATH BOAST, THERE'S NO FEAR
[38:33] INSIDE HIM. EVERYBODY ELSE IS TREMBLING
[38:35] TILL THEIR KNEES KNOCK TOGETHER, till
[38:36] their bones are moving OUT OF JOINT.
[38:38] AMEN. BUT SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT IN HIM.
[38:40] AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE DAVID'S A BETTER
[38:42] MAN. It's because David WAS CHOSEN OF
[38:45] GOD, ANOINTED BY THE PROPHET, AND has
[38:47] the spirit of God resting upon him.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD DID NOT LEAVE IT TO DAVID TO
[38:55] DO HIMSELF. AMEN. HE SENT THE ANOINTING
[38:57] OF A PROPHET UPON HIM. AND HE SENT THE
[38:59] POWER OF HIS SPIRIT UPON HIM TO
[39:01] ACCOMPLISH WHAT HE ANOINTED HIM TO DO.
[39:04] AND GOD HAS NOT ASKED US TO GO OUT,
[39:06] AMEN, AND BE WHATEVER IN OUR OWN
[39:07] strength we need to be for THIS MESSAGE,
[39:09] BUT WE'RE UNDER THE ANOINTING OF A
[39:11] PROPHET. AND THEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD HAS
[39:13] BEEN POURED OUT WITH THIS WORD, AMEN, TO
[39:15] GIVE US THE ANOINTING AND THE POWER TO
[39:17] FACE EVERY DEVIL, TO FACE EVERY GIANT,
[39:20] TO FACE every lion and bear.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S NOT US, BUT IT'S GOD'S CHOICE
[39:25] IN US AND THE EQUIPPING THAT HE EQUIPS
[39:28] UNDER THE ANOINTING and the power to do
[39:30] his work.
[39:33] Amen. It wasn't David.
[39:36] It was God's choice and God's will and
[39:40] God's power and God's anointing.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Brother said it wasn't even David that
[39:47] killed Goliath. He said it was the
[39:49] spirit of God who caught that stone
[39:51] &gt;&gt; when it left the sling and guided it to
[39:53] the one spot in his armor.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was David. David was
[40:01] God's choice.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; And God was beginning to display him his
[40:06] choice to all of Israel.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Not not because of David, but because of
[40:13] God.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; So he kills Goliath and then he gets a
[40:18] commission in the army and and he begins
[40:21] to slay thousands and ten thousands and
[40:24] then then people begin to write songs
[40:26] that the the the ladies begin to sing.
[40:28] Saul has killed his thousands, but David
[40:30] has killed his 10,000. And then David
[40:32] wasn't killing 10,000 by the strength of
[40:34] his arm. He was under an anointing
[40:37] &gt;&gt; and under the power of God. And he was a
[40:40] king already anointed to be king. And
[40:42] that was what was moving in his life.
[40:44] And the anointing of God in his life
[40:46] gets him in trouble with Saul.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; And David didn't want trouble with Saul.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; DAVID DIDN'T WANT ANY PROBLEMS. HE TRIED
[40:56] TO AMEND THEM. HE TRIED for peace. He
[40:58] tried everything he could. Amen. AND IT
[41:01] WASN'T DAVID'S FAULT. IT WAS THE
[41:03] ANOINTING HE WAS UNDER. AND IT WAS THE
[41:05] POWER that rested upon him. HE WASN'T
[41:08] TRYING TO CAUSE PROBLEMS,
[41:10] &gt;&gt; but the anointing he WAS UNDER WAS
[41:12] CAUSING PROBLEMS. WHY? BECAUSE GOD TOLD
[41:15] SAMUEL, "ANOINT HIM when he walked into
[41:18] the room without him having anything to
[41:20] do WITH IT." AMEN. GOD SAID, "ANNOINT
[41:22] HIM." And under that anointing came a
[41:24] power. AND UNDER THAT ANOINTING AND
[41:26] POWER, HE WAS ALREADY ACTING LIKE A king
[41:28] and destroying the enemies of Israel.
[41:30] And and they were singing songs of HIS
[41:32] PRAISES. AND SAUL WAS GETTING JEALOUS.
[41:34] AND NOW SAUL WAS TRYING TO KILL HIM. And
[41:36] this ANOINTING AND THIS POWER BEGAN TO
[41:38] CAUSE HIM ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Just like Paul.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; I'm going to show him great things he
[41:46] must suffer.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; As soon as as soon Amen. as as as Ananas
[41:53] comes in and lays hands on on Saul.
[41:56] AMEN. AND AND SAUL NOW GETS UP AND IS
[41:58] baptized and he's filled with the Holy
[42:00] Ghost and immediately he goes into
[42:02] Damascus and he goes into the synagogue
[42:04] and he starts preaching Christ and
[42:06] proving to them from the scriptures that
[42:07] Jesus was the Christ.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Immediately.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; And then what do they do? The Jews
[42:15] sought to kill him.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED? OH, HE WAS JUST GOING
[42:21] ALONG DOING HIS THING. AND GOD
[42:23] interrupted his plan. God came in and
[42:26] changed his perspective, CHANGED HIS
[42:28] PLAN. AND GOD, AMEN, COME AND OPENED HIS
[42:31] EYES TO ANANAS. And God told him,
[42:33] "You're my chosen vessel. You'll do
[42:35] this." AND THEN GOD FILLED HIM WITH THE
[42:37] SPIRIT. AND GOD GAVE HIM REVELATION of
[42:39] the word. And all he does is go out
[42:41] under the anointing to preach the
[42:42] revelation of the word. And all of the
[42:44] trouble starts. Yeah.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Now, David is running from cave to cave
[42:49] to cave cuz Saul hates him. And all of a
[42:51] sudden, HIS LIFE IS DIFFICULT AND HE'S
[42:53] GOT ALL KINDS OF TROUBLES AND AND and we
[42:55] see the life of David. All kinds of
[42:57] problems.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; And David never asked to be a king.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; God told him he was.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Oh man, I love this so much. God is so
[43:10] good.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. In Exodus, this is a story of
[43:15] Moses. Moses, we know what Moses tried
[43:17] to do. I'm going to use the black screen
[43:19] of power.
[43:23] We we know that Moses was born a proper
[43:27] child and he was born to be a deliverer.
[43:29] And brother Ben tells us the stories how
[43:31] his mother jockabed used to take him on
[43:33] his knee and tell him, "You were born to
[43:35] be a deliverer and this is the promise
[43:36] to the children of Abraham and and you
[43:39] were born under a sign and this and
[43:40] that." Amen. And finally, he comes of
[43:42] age and he goes to visit his brethren
[43:44] and he's got all of this in his mind.
[43:46] Amen. And and he's an Egyptian trained
[43:48] in warfare, trained in arts, trained in
[43:50] science, and he's got it all figured
[43:52] out. And all of a sudden, he sees an
[43:54] Egyptian smiting one of his brethren,
[43:55] the Hebrews. And he says he is so
[44:00] uh so educated
[44:03] into being a deliverer, he thinks, well,
[44:06] I'm a deliverer.
[44:08] But look at what he says when he saw the
[44:10] Egyptians smiling in Hebrew. He says he
[44:12] looked this way and that way to see if
[44:14] anybody was looking.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; This isn't a godly anointing, friends.
[44:20] That's human.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you stand up to declare amen,
[44:26] the gospel and you look around to see
[44:27] which the co-workers are listening.
[44:29] Listen, that's not a godly anointing.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Right?
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's not the godly anointing. He
[44:35] looks this way and that way and he
[44:37] smites the Egyptian and kills the
[44:38] Egyptian and hides him in the sand.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; This is all human effort to serve God.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we know the next day he
[44:48] goes out and he finds the two Hebrews,
[44:50] amen, fighting one another, one smoke
[44:52] the other, and he goes to correct him
[44:53] and he says, "Who who made you ruler
[44:55] over us? Are you going to kill me as you
[44:56] did the Egyptian?" and he ran away and
[44:58] Pharaoh heard about it and wanted to
[44:59] kill him and he ran off and he got
[45:02] married and now he's working for his
[45:03] father-in-law and he he's tending the
[45:05] sheep the the the the as a herdsman and
[45:07] and he's out we he has this meeting at
[45:10] the burning bush and that's where we're
[45:11] we're at now.
[45:13] Exodus 3 says now therefore behold the
[45:16] cry of the children of Israel's come up
[45:17] unto me
[45:19] and I have also seen the oppression
[45:21] wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them.
[45:24] Come now, therefore, and I will send
[45:26] thee into Pharaoh, that thou mayest
[45:28] bring forth my people, the children of
[45:30] Israel, out of Egypt.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses didn't make this happen.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; God did.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Moses may have had an idea of who he was
[45:42] given to him by his mom, and he may have
[45:44] had an intellectual conception and a
[45:46] theological understanding of a
[45:48] deliverer. Amen. But when he went out
[45:50] humanistically before God's time, in his
[45:53] own time,
[45:54] &gt;&gt; he failed.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; But now God come to him in a burning
[45:59] bush. It wasn't Moses who made the burn
[46:02] the bush burn with fire but not be
[46:04] consumed.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; It was God who worked the miracle to get
[46:08] Moses' attention because now when it
[46:11] pleased God,
[46:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[46:15] &gt;&gt; And now was the time it pleased God. And
[46:18] now Moses goes to the burning bush to
[46:20] see what this phenomenon is. And a voice
[46:22] speaks out to him. And now God begins to
[46:24] tell him, "All right, Moses. This is
[46:25] what your mama told you. Now I've heard
[46:28] the cry. Now I'm going to send you. Now
[46:30] I go on now. I will send thee into
[46:32] Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my
[46:34] people, the children of Israel, out of
[46:36] Egypt." And this is Moses' response. And
[46:40] Moses said unto God, "Who am I that I
[46:43] should go unto Pharaoh, and that I
[46:45] should bring forth the children of
[46:46] Israel out of Egypt?"
[46:49] And he said, "Certainly, I will be with
[46:51] thee, and this shall be a token unto
[46:53] thee that I have sent thee when thou has
[46:55] brought forth the people out of Egypt.
[46:57] You shall serve God upon this mountain."
[47:00] Moses first response is, "I'm not good
[47:03] enough.
[47:06] Who Who am I that I should go into
[47:09] Pharaoh? Don't you know I'm already
[47:11] rejected? Don't you know I've already
[47:13] failed failed? Don't you know I'm back
[47:15] here? I'm a nobody. I'm a hasb been. I'm
[47:17] washed up. I'm on the back side of a
[47:19] desert.
[47:21] I'm working for my father-in-law. I I
[47:23] I'm nothing. And he says, "Who who am I
[47:27] that I should go into Pharaoh and that I
[47:28] should bring forth the children of
[47:30] Israel out of Egypt?" Moses still has
[47:32] the wrong idea of what God is looking
[47:34] for.
[47:37] Because before in his strength and in
[47:39] his power and in his humanistic ideas,
[47:42] he slew an Egyptian. He started to work
[47:44] to work. But that wasn't God's way and
[47:46] that wasn't God's time. And now he has
[47:48] no more power. He has no more strength.
[47:50] He has no more armies. He has no more
[47:52] political anything. He's down nothing.
[47:55] And he thinks, "Who am I? I can't do
[47:57] this." and he's got the wrong idea of
[48:00] what God wants.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; God wants a vessel. That's all he wants.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; He just wants a vessel, a predestinated
[48:09] vessel that he can use.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we start thinking, Amen.
[48:15] There's two ways to think. We can either
[48:16] think, I see all these skills in me. I
[48:19] can do this and I can do this and I can
[48:21] do this. God must want to use me for
[48:22] this.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; That's wrong.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Wrong.
[48:28] But the other way of looking at it is I
[48:30] can't do this and I can't do this and I
[48:32] can't do this. God must not want to use
[48:33] me.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Both are wrong.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HOW ABOUT LETTING GOD JUST DECIDE
[48:40] WHAT HE WANTS TO DO WITH your life?
[48:41] Whether you can or can't, whether you
[48:43] got it or don't got it, God can supply
[48:45] an anointing and God can supply his
[48:47] spirit and God can bring to pass
[48:49] whatever he wants to bring to pass. It's
[48:51] not us FOR US TO DECIDE I can or I
[48:54] can't. I can do it. I can't do it. I've
[48:56] got it. I don't got it. It's for us to
[48:58] stand still and let God manifest
[49:00] whatever he predestinated our purpose in
[49:03] this life to be. BECAUSE IF YOU PUT A
[49:05] PURPOSE IN YOU, HE CAN TAKE THE SMALLEST
[49:08] of the brothers h sons of Jesse and he
[49:11] can MAKE HIM KILL A GIANT.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; GOD CAN DO THAT. GOD CAN TAKE THE
[49:16] SMALLEST IN THE STATURE AND SLAY A BEAR
[49:18] AND SLAY a lion because he can put an
[49:20] anointing ON HIM FROM A PROPHET AND SEND
[49:22] THE POWER OF HIS SPIRIT UPON HIM and he
[49:24] CAN ACCOMPLISH WHATEVER HE WANTS to
[49:26] accomplish with you and I.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; We're not here to find out what we're
[49:30] good at. We're here to find out who we
[49:32] are
[49:33] &gt;&gt; and and what God wants TO DO WITH OUR
[49:35] LIFE AND JUST surrendered to him and let
[49:37] him do it.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; And here he comes TO MOSES. MOSES
[49:41] THOUGHT he had messed up. Got read the
[49:43] wrong signs. His mom misunderstood the
[49:45] sign that was over. I'm not the
[49:46] deliverer. Now God comes and says, "You
[49:48] are the deliverer." But he he'd failed
[49:50] so much and he got so low of himself.
[49:53] Amen. Living with a hot-tempered wife on
[49:55] the back side of the desert had really
[49:56] worked him over. I guess
[49:59] he said, "Who am I?
[50:02] Who am I?"
[50:04] I mean, I could imagine now God didn't
[50:06] say this, but I could imagine saying God
[50:08] saying, "Moses, who am I?"
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. forget about who you are. WHO'S
[50:15] TALKING TO YOU, MOSES?
[50:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; This is the problem with Moses. Now,
[50:22] he says, "And Moses said unto God,
[50:23] behold, when I come unto the children of
[50:26] Israel, and shall say unto them, the God
[50:28] of your father sent me." Now, this is
[50:30] this is just logic and reasoning, but I
[50:34] want to skip back to what God just said.
[50:38] God said, "Certainly, I will be with
[50:42] thee.
[50:44] Amen.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; What more do you need?
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Certainly, I will be with thee.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; End of discussion. That's all I need.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; That's it. If you'll be with me, if
[50:57] God's with you, you're in the majority.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Certainly, I'll be with thee. You don't
[51:04] need any more discussion. But he's still
[51:06] troubled in his mind. And he gives him a
[51:08] token and evidence and says, "Surely,
[51:10] this will be the token. You're going to
[51:11] come back TO THIS MOUNTAIN AFTER YOU
[51:12] DELIVER them out of Egypt and you're
[51:14] going to worship me on this mountain.
[51:16] That's thus sayeth the Lord.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; But Moses says, "But but they're not
[51:22] going to believe me. When I come unto
[51:25] the children of Israel, and I shall say
[51:26] unto them, the God of your fathers has
[51:28] sent me unto you, and they shall say to
[51:30] me, what is his name?" Listen, what is
[51:33] he talking about? GOD JUST SAID, "I'M
[51:36] SENDING YOU. I will be with you." And I
[51:40] promise you, YOU'RE GOING TO GET A token
[51:42] of what I said you'd be truth because
[51:43] you're coming back to worship on this
[51:45] mountain. And Moses is worried about if
[51:47] they're going to believe him or not when
[51:48] he says, "I talked to God and they're
[51:49] going to say, what's his name?" WHAT'S
[51:52] HE TALKING ABOUT? GOD JUST SAID, "I'LL
[51:54] BE WITH YOU AND YOU'RE COMING back to
[51:56] THIS MOUNTAIN WHEN YOU BRING THEM OUT OF
[51:57] EGYPT."
[51:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; This is the problem with human thinking.
[52:02] This is the way our human brains
[52:04] operate. We can all we see is
[52:06] hindrances. All we see is inability. All
[52:09] we see is impossibilities. AMEN. BUT
[52:12] FAITH HAS to look beyond human reasoning
[52:14] and the human mind and said, "If you'll
[52:16] be with me now, more than enough."
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:22] They say, "What is his name? What shall
[52:24] I say unto them?" And God said unto
[52:27] Moses, "I am that I am." He said, "Thus
[52:30] shalt thou say unto the children of
[52:31] Israel, I am has sent me unto you."
[52:35] Okay.
[52:37] Chapter 4:1. And Moses answered and
[52:39] said, But behold, they will not believe
[52:43] me, nor hearken unto my voice, for they
[52:46] will say, "The Lord hath not appeared
[52:47] unto thee." And the Lord said unto him,
[52:50] "What is that in thy hand?" He said, "A
[52:52] rod." Said, "Cast it on the ground." And
[52:54] he cast it on the ground, and he became
[52:56] a serpent. Moses fled from it. And this
[52:58] is where he says, "I'll give you two
[52:59] signs. I'll give you this sign. I'll
[53:00] give you a sign in the hand where you
[53:02] put your hand in your bosom, pull out
[53:03] leprosy, and do it again. It comes out
[53:05] white and clean."
[53:07] And and so, okay, we dealt with this
[53:09] one. Then he says, "And Moses said unto
[53:12] the Lord, oh my Lord, I am not eloquent,
[53:17] neither hereto for nor since thou hast
[53:19] spoken unto thy servant, but I am slow
[53:21] of speech and of a slow tongue." And the
[53:25] Lord said unto him, Who hath made man's
[53:27] mouth? Or who maketh the dumb or deaf or
[53:30] the seeing or the blind? Have not I the
[53:32] Lord? Now therefore go, I will be with
[53:34] thy mouth, and teach thee what thou
[53:36] shalt say.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Oh my Lord, send I pray
[53:44] thee by the hand of him who thou will
[53:46] send." Says, "God, please send somebody
[53:49] else."
[53:51] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Have you ever felt like
[53:54] this? When you look in the mirror, when
[53:56] you look at yourself, when you think,
[53:58] listen, we may not have this kind of
[54:00] dialogue with God, but this is exactly
[54:02] the way that our human minds work.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; But not me. But I can't be one of them,
[54:08] but it can't be me. How could I be the
[54:10] bride? But I make so many mistakes, but
[54:12] I but I've done this, but you don't know
[54:14] my past, but I can't.
[54:19] It says, "And the anger of the Lord was
[54:21] kindled against Moses."
[54:25] And he said, "Is not Aaron Levite, Aaron
[54:27] the Levite, thy brother? I know that he
[54:29] can speak well, and also, behold, he
[54:31] cometh forth to meet thee, and when he
[54:33] seeth thee, he will be glad in his
[54:34] heart, and thou shalt speak unto him,
[54:36] and put his word, put words in his
[54:38] mouth, and I will be with thy mouth, and
[54:40] with his mouth, and will teach you what
[54:42] you shall do."
[54:44] This this dialogue with God and Moses to
[54:48] me is so astounding in the scriptures
[54:50] that God comes down and says, "Listen,
[54:53] now's the time. The prophecy fulfilled.
[54:55] I'm going down and I'm sending you." And
[54:57] Moses says, "No, I it won't work."
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; But he says, "But I'll be with you and
[55:04] you're going to come back here." But but
[55:06] they won't listen to me. And if they ask
[55:08] me who talk to me, what am I going to
[55:09] tell them?
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Well, just tell them I am sent you.
[55:13] But they won't believe me. They won't
[55:16] listen to me. They won't believe that
[55:17] you appeared to me. Okay. What's in your
[55:19] hand? A rod. Okay. Throw it down. It's a
[55:21] servant. Take it up. It's a stick. All
[55:22] right. Do look at these two signs.
[55:24] They'll believe the signs. The voice of
[55:25] the signs.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; But I'm not eloquent of speech, but
[55:34] how many excuses can one person come up
[55:36] with when they're talking to God?
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:41] Why not just say, "I'm not worthy to be
[55:44] nothing."
[55:46] That's a double negative,
[55:49] &gt;&gt; but by the grace of God, I am what I am.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; God, if that's what you want me to do,
[55:54] if that's what you want me to be, I'll
[55:55] go. I have no idea how I'm going to do
[55:57] it. I've got no idea. I got a million
[56:00] questions. It looks like it's
[56:01] impossible, but if you'll be with me, if
[56:04] you've made the promise, it'll work.
[56:06] Amen.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; In the message expectation he said
[56:11] testifying when he come he said I am
[56:14] sent from the presence of God to tell
[56:16] you your birth in life is to indicate
[56:18] that you are take a gift of healing to
[56:20] the peoples of the world. This is when
[56:21] the angel visited brother Brandham to
[56:23] give him his commission and be to tell
[56:26] me different things would happen. I told
[56:28] him that I was uneducated and wasn't
[56:30] able to go. He told me I'd be given two
[56:33] signs. It said the people will not
[56:34] believe. I said, "The people will not
[56:36] believe me because I'm not educated
[56:38] sufficient to speak to people."
[56:41] He said, "You'll be given two signs as
[56:43] was the prophet Moses." He said, "One
[56:45] sign will be that you'll detect diseases
[56:48] through your hand. When the people
[56:49] contact you, well, you'll be able to
[56:51] tell them what diseases they have
[56:53] through a supernatural discernment." and
[56:56] then said, "If you'll be sincere, then
[56:58] it will come to pass that you'll tell
[57:00] the people the secrets of their hearts
[57:01] and the things that they've done in life
[57:03] that might have hindered their healing
[57:05] and so forth." And I said, "I I'm well,
[57:08] they'll they will not believe me." He
[57:11] said, "I will be with you." I said, "I
[57:14] will go."
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Praise God. How many of you are glad he
[57:19] said, "I will go."
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not that he was able. Not that he
[57:25] had skills, not that he had the
[57:26] abilities to do anything. But God says,
[57:29] "I I I've come with a commission." And
[57:32] listen, the angel says, "I've come from
[57:34] the presence of the Lord."
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. If if he come from the presence OF
[57:40] THE LORD TO TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE and
[57:43] what your purpose is and to give you
[57:44] your commission from God Almighty, THEN
[57:47] MY IF THAT'S WHAT GOD SAYS I AM, THEN
[57:49] THAT'S what I am. Amen.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; AND IF THAT'S WHAT GOD SAYS I'M TO DO,
[57:53] THEN THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. I
[57:56] DON'T KNOW HOW. AND BROTHER BENHAM
[57:57] HIMSELF HAD QUESTIONS. I'M NOT ELOQUENT.
[57:59] I I CAN'T SPEAK. I'M not educated. They
[58:01] don't They won't believe me. Amen. But
[58:03] the angel said, "You'll be given two
[58:05] signs." Like Moses was given two signs.
[58:07] Amen. And here's what the signs will be.
[58:09] And And Brother BAM AGAIN SAYS, "BUT I'M
[58:11] NOT EDUCATED. They're not going to
[58:12] believe me." But he says, "I will be
[58:14] with you."
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I will go."
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's all I need. If you GO WITH
[58:22] ME, I'LL GO.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; OH, I'm so glad we had a prophet in this
[58:26] day. Amen. With a seventh grade
[58:28] education, couldn't read the big words
[58:30] in the Bible. Amen. Was intimidated.
[58:32] Amen. To begin with in the ministry.
[58:35] But, but because he was sent, Amen. an
[58:37] angel from the presence of the Lord gave
[58:39] him a message from God and promised to
[58:41] be with him. He went and he went listen
[58:43] when brother Brandham went he didn't
[58:45] know how he was going to pray for kings
[58:48] and potentates and and he was going to
[58:50] travel around the world even his pastor
[58:52] told him said how are you with a seventh
[58:53] grade education going to go to places
[58:55] like that and talk to those kind of
[58:57] people and brother SAID I DON'T KNOW HOW
[58:59] BUT HE SAID IT and I believe it
[59:02] &gt;&gt; I don't know how I'm going TO DO IT
[59:03] BROTHER didn't have it figured out he he
[59:06] had maybe as many questions and doubts
[59:08] as Moses had about himself but he knew
[59:11] one saying that THIS MESSAGE I GOT COME
[59:13] from the presence OF GOD AND THAT ANGEL
[59:16] PROMISED HE WOULD BE WITH ME.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; And you're going to pray for kings and
[59:23] potentates and and you're going to
[59:25] travel the world. And this was a man who
[59:27] had hardly left uh uh hardly left
[59:30] Indiana except one stent when he when he
[59:32] went to Arizona. Amen. And he worked for
[59:34] a while in a ranch and then came back
[59:36] after his brother died. Listen, he he
[59:39] traveled the world. He had no money.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. But uh uh uh pray for kings and
[59:46] potentates and ALL OF THESE PEOPLE.
[59:48] LISTEN, he had a seventh grade
[59:50] education. And when he first went out,
[59:52] Amen. He didn't even have a A PROPER
[59:54] SUIT IN HIS COAT. HE had to mend by
[59:56] himself. And listen, and that's why he
[59:58] began to shake people's left hand
[1:00:00] because he would cover. I mean, the
[1:00:01] patch job HE DID ON HIS POCKET and his
[1:00:03] coat with his right hand. He wasn't even
[1:00:05] DRESSED RIGHT, COULDN'T TALK RIGHT,
[1:00:06] DIDN'T HAVE EDUCATION, DIDN'T KNOW how
[1:00:08] to conduct meetings, didn't know how to
[1:00:10] handle finances, didn't know how to rent
[1:00:12] facilities, didn't know how to do
[1:00:14] anything, but he just went.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE GOD CALLED HIM, GOD
[1:00:19] PROTECTED HIM, GOD ANOINTED HIM, GOD
[1:00:21] EMPOWERED HIM, AND GOD OPENED ALL THE
[1:00:23] DOORS.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; He didn't HAVE TO HAVE IT FIGURED OUT
[1:00:25] BEFORE. ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS GO. LISTEN,
[1:00:28] and you don't have to figure ANYTHING
[1:00:30] OUT. WHATEVER GOD'S CALLED YOU TO DO IN
[1:00:32] THIS LIFE, HE CAN DO THROUGH YOU. HE'LL
[1:00:34] OPEN THE DOORS. HE'LL CLOSE THE DOORS.
[1:00:36] HE'LL EDUCATE.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't have accepted little
[1:00:44] little Jesse's little son, David, as
[1:00:45] their king.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; So God made sure there was a big old
[1:00:49] giant show up one day to scare them all
[1:00:51] to death.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Till their bones were rattling
[1:00:56] inside and their knees were sming
[1:00:58] together. AMEN. AND THEY WERE ALL
[1:01:00] TERRIFIED. AMEN. FROM SAUL ALL THE WAY
[1:01:02] THROUGH. EVEN ILAB, the big brother who
[1:01:05] looked like a king WITH BROAD SHOULDERS,
[1:01:07] HE WAS SCARED HIDING IN THE TENT. WHEN
[1:01:08] LITTLE DAVID showed up WITH A LITTLE
[1:01:10] CART FULL OF CHEESE AND BREAD and wine.
[1:01:12] Amen. AND HE STARTS SAYING, "WHY ARE YOU
[1:01:14] GUYS SCARED OF DEATH? WHY DON'T SOMEBODY
[1:01:16] GO AND KILL HIM, KILL HIM?"
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; WHY HAS HE LIVED THIS LONG?
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS GOD DOING? AMEN. GOLIATH WAS
[1:01:25] SERVING GOD'S PURPOSE IN DAVID.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:30] David didn't know how God was going to
[1:01:32] make him a king. David didn't know what
[1:01:34] GOD WOULD DO. BUT GOD KNEW WHAT HE WOULD
[1:01:36] DO. AND GOD KNEW HOW to accomplish it.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam didn't know HOW TO GO OUT
[1:01:41] and start a worldwide healing campaign.
[1:01:44] HE HAD NO IDEA. AMEN. IT STARTED WITH
[1:01:46] ONE PERSON WITH A NEED. AND IT STARTED
[1:01:48] BY GOING TO A HOSPITAL. THEN IT STARTED
[1:01:50] BY a news article. And that news article
[1:01:52] went to somebody else. AND HE GOT CALLED
[1:01:54] OUT TO ILLINOIS or Indiana or wherever
[1:01:56] it was. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, one thing
[1:01:58] after another happened. HE WAS LED STEP
[1:02:00] BY STEP, BUT HE WAS anointed and he had
[1:02:03] the power of the HOLY GHOST AND GOD did
[1:02:05] it all.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Brother Bam says this. Now,
[1:02:11] I want you to know this is sure know
[1:02:13] this is sure. And you that listen to
[1:02:15] this tape,
[1:02:17] you might have thought today that I was
[1:02:18] trying to say that about myself being
[1:02:20] that I was packing this message. I have
[1:02:22] no more to do with it than nothing. No
[1:02:24] more than just a voice. and my voice
[1:02:26] even against my better judgment. I
[1:02:28] wanted to be a trapper.
[1:02:31] But it's the will of my father that I
[1:02:33] declare to do and I determine and
[1:02:35] determined to do.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Remember I said this wasn't my idea.
[1:02:40] I didn't decide to have a worldwide
[1:02:42] ministry. I didn't decide to have a mill
[1:02:44] healing ministry. I didn't decide to
[1:02:46] have have two gifts
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; that would show themselves. I didn't
[1:02:51] decide to BE A PROPHET. I DIDN'T DECIDE
[1:02:52] ANY OF THAT. I WAS just I was just
[1:02:55] there.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; He decided against my decision
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; against my better judgment,
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad God picks.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; I would have made myself something. I
[1:03:13] don't know what I would have been. Amen.
[1:03:15] But I'm so glad God picks. Amen.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; And if God picks and God ordains and God
[1:03:23] sends, then God must make a way.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; God must provide. God must protect. God
[1:03:29] must defend. God must demonstrate. God
[1:03:32] must show his power.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; If we send ourselves, Amen. We'll go
[1:03:37] like Moses.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Is anybody looking?
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; I don't want to get in trouble.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Kill one Egyptian and hide him under the
[1:03:46] sand. That was the great deliverer,
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; That was a man trying to be something
[1:03:52] before his time,
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; of his own efforts.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Then when the other one challenged him,
[1:03:58] he runs away scared.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; If we go ourselves in our own time and
[1:04:04] our own calling, that's how it'll be.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; But if we wait on God when it pleased
[1:04:10] God,
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; then God has to make all the provisions
[1:04:13] for us.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. in Acts chapter 13. Turn there
[1:04:18] with with me.
[1:04:20] Acts 13:46.
[1:04:27] Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and
[1:04:29] said, "It was necessary that the word of
[1:04:31] God should first have been spoken to
[1:04:33] you. But seeing you put it from you and
[1:04:35] judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting
[1:04:37] life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. For
[1:04:40] so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I
[1:04:42] have set thee to be a light of the
[1:04:43] Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for
[1:04:45] salvation and to the ends of the earth.
[1:04:49] That's a prophecy out of Isaiah. And
[1:04:52] when the Gentiles heard this, they were
[1:04:53] glad and glorified the word of the Lord.
[1:04:56] And as many as were ordained to eternal
[1:04:58] life believed.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Let's read that again. And as many as
[1:05:04] were ordained to eternal life believed.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:05:09] Which came first, believing or being
[1:05:12] ordained?
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Appointed,
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; chosen.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Why did they believe? Because they were
[1:05:19] already ordained to eternal life
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; by the predestination of God.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; They were ordained to believe.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; They were believers because they were
[1:05:32] predestinated to believe.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't because these Gentiles
[1:05:38] happened to be smarter than the Jews
[1:05:39] that were in that city.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; It was because they were ordained unto
[1:05:46] eternal life. They were predestinated.
[1:05:48] They were chosen of God, they were
[1:05:50] positioned for eternal life. And because
[1:05:51] of that, when the message came to them,
[1:05:54] they believed.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:06:00] when it says as many as were ordained to
[1:06:04] eternal life believed,
[1:06:07] that means God chose for them to
[1:06:09] believe.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; That means they believed because of
[1:06:13] God's choice.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; So, you mean God ordained them to
[1:06:22] believe?
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:25] And if you ordained them to believe,
[1:06:28] then did he ordain us to believe?
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; And if he ordained us to believe, then
[1:06:33] we've been ordained into eternal life.
[1:06:35] We've been predestinated. And God has
[1:06:37] positionally placed us as believers.
[1:06:39] We're not believers just because we want
[1:06:41] to be believers.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Listen, I want to be a believer.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; I mean, I want to be, but but my wanting
[1:06:49] to be cannot change God's eternal
[1:06:52] purpose in his mind. AMEN. BUT GOD GOD
[1:06:56] CHOSE ME TO BE a believer. And that
[1:06:58] makes me a believer because he chose me
[1:07:00] to be a believer because by grace are we
[1:07:02] saved through faith and that not of
[1:07:04] ourselves. It is a gift of God.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; The ability to believe is a gift from
[1:07:08] God. AMEN. SO GOD ORDAINED US, AMEN,
[1:07:11] unto eternal life. And when we heard the
[1:07:13] message, we believe not because we were
[1:07:15] better than anybody else on this planet.
[1:07:18] Amen. Better skills or better abilities.
[1:07:20] Amen. But we believe because God
[1:07:22] ordained us to be believers in this age
[1:07:24] because that's our position.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND IT DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD TO LOOK
[1:07:30] AT GOD AND SAY, "GOD, I BELIEVE THIS
[1:07:32] MESSAGE, BUT BUT YOU DON'T KNOW. BUT BUT
[1:07:35] GOD, WHAT ABOUT BUT GOD?" NO, THAT
[1:07:37] NOBODY WILL BELIEVE I'M A BELIEVER, BUT
[1:07:39] GOD, I'VE GOT ALL THESE PROBLEMS IN THE
[1:07:40] PAST, BUT GOD, I'VE GOT A BAD
[1:07:42] REPUTATION, BUT GOD, I'VE GOT THIS AND
[1:07:44] I'VE GOT THAT. LISTEN, BE QUIET.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. RIGHT?
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; IF GOD SAYS YOU'RE A BELIEVER, YOU'RE A
[1:07:52] BELIEVER, and if you're a believer, and
[1:07:53] you believe this message, THEN YOU'RE
[1:07:55] PART OF HIS BRIDE. HE CHOSE THAT. YOU
[1:07:57] DIDN'T CHOOSE THAT.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:03] So many people are still arguing with
[1:08:05] God.
[1:08:06] They believe.
[1:08:08] Listen, they they believe. Then they
[1:08:11] have all the questions like Moses had.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Then they got all the TROUBLE WITH THEIR
[1:08:15] PAST LIKE SAUL HAD. THEY'VE GOT ALL
[1:08:17] THESE ISSUES. AMEN. And and they start
[1:08:19] thinking because of all THE ISSUES I I I
[1:08:22] can't be. I must not be. And then they
[1:08:24] end up being miserable.
[1:08:27] Miserable. Miserable. Saying I I must
[1:08:30] not be a real believer because because
[1:08:32] of this thing in my life or because this
[1:08:34] thing in my past because I can't this or
[1:08:36] because I can't that. I must not be a
[1:08:38] believer.
[1:08:40] But they're utterly miserable.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; And you know what makes them miserable?
[1:08:44] is because they believe the message.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Right? Amen.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; If they didn't believe the message, then
[1:08:50] they wouldn't mind not being a believer.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THE
[1:08:56] MESSAGE THAT THEY'RE TORMENTED BY THE
[1:08:58] THOUGHT THAT MAYBE they're not a
[1:08:59] believer, proving they're a believer.
[1:09:01] They need to FORGET ABOUT THE TORMENT
[1:09:03] AND JUST BE A BELIEVER.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; AND THANK GOD THAT YOU'VE BEEN ORDAINED
[1:09:07] INTO ETERNAL LIFE. THAT WHEN YOU HEAR
[1:09:09] THE MESSAGE, YOU BELIEVE. BECAUSE YOU
[1:09:11] CAN'T CHOOSE TO BELIEVE. GOD HAD TO
[1:09:13] CHOOSE BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE
[1:09:15] WORLD OR YOU WOULD WALK AWAY
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; LIKE MILLIONS HAVE WALKED AWAY. LISTEN,
[1:09:20] HOW FEW PEOPLE on this planet have
[1:09:22] actually heard the message?
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; You did.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Out of all the people THAT HEARD THE
[1:09:27] MESSAGE, HOW MANY BELIEVE the message?
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; YOU DID.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; WHY STAY IN MISERY TRYING TO CONVINCE
[1:09:35] GOD YOU'RE NOT A BELIEVER AND CONVINCE
[1:09:37] YOURSELF YOU'RE NOT A BELIEVER? And
[1:09:38] you're miserable being a not a believer
[1:09:40] believer.
[1:09:44] Listen, people who AREN'T REALLY
[1:09:46] BELIEVERS, THEY'RE FINE JUST MOVING ON
[1:09:47] AND FINDING SOMETHING ELSE IN LIFE TO
[1:09:49] DO.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; It's the people who believe the message,
[1:09:53] WHO DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOOD ENOUGH.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; To be a believer that are miserable
[1:10:00] human beings because they won't JUST
[1:10:02] ACCEPT WHAT GOD HAS MADE THEM. AMEN.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, AND IF GOD HAS MADE YOU THAT,
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; then God's got to clean you up, fix you,
[1:10:12] equip you, ordain you, bring you out of
[1:10:15] your slumps, help you OVERCOME YOUR
[1:10:16] COMPLEXES. YEAH. WHAT CAN WE DO? AMEN.
[1:10:19] WE NEVER MADE OURSELVES GOOD ENOUGH. WE
[1:10:20] WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH. BUT HE CHOSE US. IF
[1:10:22] HE CHOSE US, HE'S GOT TO DO THE WORK
[1:10:24] LIKE HE DID FOR MOSES, LIKE HE DID FOR
[1:10:26] PAUL, LIKE HE DID FOR DAVID. AMEN.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; We just got to accept what he says.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Go to Acts chapter 8. No, no, I'm not
[1:10:36] going to go there. I'm going skip that.
[1:10:40] Seventh seal.
[1:10:42] As they were a remnant according to
[1:10:44] election, these Jews are now. He's
[1:10:46] speaking of the tribulation period. The
[1:10:48] remnant according to election in the
[1:10:50] days of Elijah's first ministry to the
[1:10:52] Jews where 7,000 believers were kept
[1:10:54] away by the hand of God. Now there is in
[1:10:57] this remnant time coming in their time
[1:10:59] to be 144,000 according to the election
[1:11:03] that the message at that time to to
[1:11:05] believe the message will be 144,000.
[1:11:09] Listen in the days of Elijah Elijah
[1:11:12] thought he was the only one when he was
[1:11:14] back in the cave and God says no I have
[1:11:17] reserved
[1:11:18] this is what he says in the book of
[1:11:20] Romans. He says, "I have reserved to
[1:11:23] myself."
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; 7,000 that have not bowed the knee.
[1:11:29] Those 7,000 men didn't reserve
[1:11:32] themselves.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Weren't better Israelites.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; GOD SAYS, "I RESERVE TO myself
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; 7,000 that haven't bowed the knee."
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Why were there 7,000 that didn't bow the
[1:11:48] knee? because God determined that
[1:11:50] there'd be 7,000 who didn't bow their
[1:11:51] knee.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't fall by the same
[1:11:55] deception.
[1:11:56] And then what's funny too is he tells
[1:11:58] Elijah, "Hey, listen Elijah. I got three
[1:12:00] things for you to do. I want you to
[1:12:01] anoint Joo. I want you to anoint this
[1:12:02] one king over Syria. And I want you to
[1:12:04] anoint Elisha to be prophet in
[1:12:06] yourstead."
[1:12:07] Then he goes off from Mount Horeb. And
[1:12:10] he goes along and here's Elisha. You
[1:12:13] know what Elisha's doing? He's being a
[1:12:16] good boy
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; working for dad
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; and he's plowing behind 12 a team of 12
[1:12:22] oxen and he's by the 12 and he's just
[1:12:25] being a good boy working his dad's farm
[1:12:28] doing what he was told to do.
[1:12:32] I wonder what Elisha was thinking about
[1:12:34] that day.
[1:12:36] Man, these ox are slow.
[1:12:39] It's going to be all it's going to be
[1:12:41] late in the afternoon before I get this
[1:12:42] job done. and all my friends will this
[1:12:45] and the servants are this and I probably
[1:12:47] missed lunch or whatever he was thinking
[1:12:48] about.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; He might have been thinking about how
[1:12:51] good the soil smells when it turns over.
[1:12:53] He might have been watching the the the
[1:12:55] the hooves of the oxen as they clop
[1:12:57] along. They go down one long row and
[1:12:59] then he turns them around positions and
[1:13:00] they go down another row. He's just
[1:13:02] doing his daily routine and all of a
[1:13:04] sudden the prophet Elijah comes by,
[1:13:06] takes off his mantle and throws it over
[1:13:07] his shoulders
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; and from that moment his whole life
[1:13:11] changes. Yeah.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; What did Elijah have to what did Elisha
[1:13:16] have to do with that? Nothing.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; That was God's choice.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; The 7,000 were God's choice.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; And now in the seventh seal, Brother
[1:13:28] Benham's telling us the elected will
[1:13:30] come out and the tribulation period. God
[1:13:32] will call his elected. And that is the
[1:13:34] Jews during that time. The elected. The
[1:13:36] Bible speaks of it. Paul speaks of it.
[1:13:38] According to the election, there will be
[1:13:40] 144,000
[1:13:42] according to the election. There's a
[1:13:44] reason I'm reading this over and over
[1:13:45] that will believe the message out of
[1:13:47] literally millions that will be there
[1:13:50] over in Israel right now. I think
[1:13:52] there's somewhere between 6 and 7,000
[1:13:55] million or six and 7 million, sorry, 6
[1:13:58] and 7 million Jews
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; in Palestine.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; How many are going to believe the
[1:14:05] message of the two witnesses?
[1:14:07] How many will believe?
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; You passed the test.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; So, is God waiting to see how many of 7
[1:14:14] million will believe?
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Is God waiting for good people to decide
[1:14:19] that this sounds like a good message?
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; What message are the 144,000 going to
[1:14:25] receive? They're going to seem the
[1:14:26] receive the same message you're hearing.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; That's what Brother Bam said. So,
[1:14:30] they'll receive the same message you're
[1:14:32] hearing tonight. Amen. And they're going
[1:14:33] to receive it through two prophets,
[1:14:35] Moses and Elijah. It'll be in two men
[1:14:36] there that'll be preaching the gospel.
[1:14:38] And they'll be preaching it with signs
[1:14:40] following. And out of millions, God is
[1:14:42] not waiting to see who's who. Cuz he
[1:14:45] said there's going to be 144,000. And
[1:14:48] better than that, he said there's GOING
[1:14:49] TO BE 12,000 OUT OF EACH TRIBE. HE HAS
[1:14:52] ALREADY DETERMINED who will believe the
[1:14:54] message.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; God's not waiting to find out. Amen.
[1:14:59] Brother Brenham made this statement over
[1:15:00] and over. I just got one quote here
[1:15:02] where he says, "This is in the hidden
[1:15:04] life with Christ.
[1:15:06] So you see the argument of that just
[1:15:08] doesn't stand. But we're not arguing.
[1:15:10] We're preaching the word. And God will
[1:15:11] have somebody that'll hear it and
[1:15:13] receive it. Those who Jesus died to hear
[1:15:16] the word, they'll hear it. Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Did you ever think of that? May I stop
[1:15:21] here just for a moment and realize I'm
[1:15:23] facing clergymen and smart men, but I'd
[1:15:25] just like to say this. Know that I
[1:15:27] believe this and I know it. Jesus never
[1:15:30] went to the cross and died for some
[1:15:31] haphazard affair. Right?
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Perhaps maybe somebody might feel sorry
[1:15:36] because he died and so they come to get
[1:15:38] saved. God doesn't run his business like
[1:15:40] that. God runs his business by
[1:15:42] fornowledge knowing before the world
[1:15:44] ever was formed who was his own.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; We were in God's fornowledge. We were
[1:15:50] saved before the foundation of the
[1:15:52] world. And Jesus came to die for those
[1:15:54] who God by fornowledge had elected.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; God was not waiting to see who would
[1:15:59] believe.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is not waiting now to see who
[1:16:05] will believe.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; There'll be preaching. There'll be
[1:16:08] signs. But he already said there'll be
[1:16:10] 144,000
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; that believe.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; And there'll be 12,000 out of each
[1:16:15] tribe.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; He has already appointed it. He has
[1:16:18] already ordained it. And that's the way
[1:16:19] that it'll be.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; And I don't think any of those 144,000
[1:16:24] are going to be able to beat their chest
[1:16:26] and say, "Haha, look at me." And listen,
[1:16:28] THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. GOD HAD
[1:16:29] ALREADY DETERMINED YOU'RE ONE OF THEM.
[1:16:32] YEAH.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; John 15, Jesus says, "You have not
[1:16:38] chosen me, but I have chosen you and
[1:16:40] ordained you that you should go and
[1:16:42] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[1:16:44] should remain that whatsoever you shall
[1:16:46] ask of the Father in my name, he may
[1:16:48] give it you."
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Peter didn't choose
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus chose Peter.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Andrew, James, and John, and
[1:16:57] Bartholomew, and all of them, they were
[1:16:58] chosen by Jesus.
[1:17:01] in the church ages book in the Smirn
[1:17:04] age. This is what brother said. He goes
[1:17:06] through several scriptures. I'm going to
[1:17:07] read these together. John 6:37 and 44
[1:17:11] says, "All that the father giveth me
[1:17:13] shall come to me, and him that cometh to
[1:17:16] me, I shall in no wise cast out. No man
[1:17:20] can come to me except the Father draw
[1:17:22] him, and I will raise him up at the last
[1:17:25] day."
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:28] All that the Father giveth me shall come
[1:17:31] to me.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; God's already chose.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; John 1:12. But as many as received him,
[1:17:39] to them gave he power to become the sons
[1:17:41] of God, even to them that believe on his
[1:17:43] name, which were born not of blood, nor
[1:17:46] the will of flesh, nor the will of man,
[1:17:48] but of God.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] Ephesians 1:4, "According as he hath
[1:17:53] chosen us in him before the foundation
[1:17:55] of the world, that we should be holy and
[1:17:57] without blame before him in love, having
[1:17:59] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:18:01] children by Jesus Christ to himself,
[1:18:04] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:18:06] will." Now, without getting too involved
[1:18:08] in the subject of sovereignty of God,
[1:18:10] for that would take a book in itself,
[1:18:12] let me point out here that according to
[1:18:14] these verses, Jesus Christ is choosing
[1:18:16] his own bride just the same as men
[1:18:19] choose their brides today. The bride
[1:18:22] today does not simply decide she is
[1:18:25] going to take a certain man for a
[1:18:26] husband. No sir, it's the groom who
[1:18:29] decides and chooses a certain woman for
[1:18:31] his bride. Yeah. Amen.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; John 15:16. You have not chosen me, but
[1:18:36] I have chosen you. Now, according to the
[1:18:37] word of God, the bride was chosen before
[1:18:40] the foundation of the world. This
[1:18:42] choosing of the bride was purposed in
[1:18:43] himself. Ephesians 1:9. And in Romans
[1:18:46] 9:11, it says that the purpose of God
[1:18:48] according to election might stand. You
[1:18:52] can't read it any other way. The heart
[1:18:54] purpose, the eternal purpose of God was
[1:18:57] to take a bride of his own choosing. See
[1:19:01] all capitals.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Who chose?
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Did you choose or did he choose?
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; To take a bride of his own choosing. And
[1:19:12] that purpose was in himself. And being
[1:19:14] eternal was decreed before the
[1:19:16] foundation of the world.
[1:19:18] Listen, it's not that I chose, it's that
[1:19:21] he chose.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; God wasn't waiting to see what I would
[1:19:26] choose. He already chose me.
[1:19:30] It's my job to surrender to him
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; to exercise free moral agency and
[1:19:35] surrender back to him. But he already
[1:19:38] chose
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; again in the Sammy church. He is not the
[1:19:44] person that comes predestined eternally
[1:19:45] from God. It's the word or seed that is
[1:19:48] it way back there too far back for human
[1:19:50] mind to grasp. The eternal God with
[1:19:52] eternal thoughts thought and decreed.
[1:19:55] Jacob have I loved but Esau have I
[1:19:57] hated.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. when and neither was born and
[1:20:01] neither had done good or evil.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Why? That the purpose of election might
[1:20:05] stand.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; See, it was the thought and then that
[1:20:09] thought became expressed and God bought
[1:20:11] back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed.
[1:20:14] Jacob alone had the seed. That is why he
[1:20:17] had respect to the birthright and
[1:20:19] covenant of God. If you are true seed,
[1:20:24] you will hear the word. Amen.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; The spirit will baptize you into the
[1:20:32] body of Christ, filling you and
[1:20:33] empowering you, and you will receive the
[1:20:36] word for your day and age. You will
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; If you're a true seed, you will hear the
[1:20:44] word.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Have you heard the word?
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. The spirit will baptize you in the
[1:20:51] body of Christ, filling you and
[1:20:52] empowering you, and you will receive the
[1:20:55] word for your day and age. Why? Because
[1:20:57] you're seed. You're a thought. You're in
[1:20:59] THE FORNOWLEDGE OF GOD. YOU'RE
[1:21:01] predestinated to be part of his bride.
[1:21:03] He chose you and ordained you as PART OF
[1:21:05] HIS BRIDE. THAT'S why you believe.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; He's not waiting to see if you'll
[1:21:12] believe. He's not waiting to see if
[1:21:13] after you believe if you'll become a
[1:21:14] good boy or girl. He'll take care of all
[1:21:16] of that. What he's doing is he's waiting
[1:21:18] for us TO JUST SAY, "I BELIEVE. I WILL
[1:21:20] GO.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; I will go. IF YOU SAY YOU'LL BE WITH ME,
[1:21:24] I'LL GO. I'LL BE WHAT YOU'VE CALLED ME
[1:21:26] TO BE, BUT GOD, I'M GOING TO NEED your
[1:21:28] help.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; I can't do THIS BY MYSELF. I'M JUST AS
[1:21:32] BAD OFF AS MOSES WAS. I'm as bad off as
[1:21:34] brother Brandham was. I'm just as LITTLE
[1:21:36] ON THE BACKSIDE of the desert as David
[1:21:39] was. I'm just as evil and wretched and
[1:21:42] going the WRONG WAY AS SAUL IS. I'M LIKE
[1:21:44] ALL OF THEM. BUT IF YOU CAN do that for
[1:21:45] them by predestination, then you can do
[1:21:47] for me whatever you purposed for me to
[1:21:49] do.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER MY PURPOSE IS, you will MAKE A
[1:21:53] WAY. WHATEVER I need to do and
[1:21:54] accomplish for your word, say you'll
[1:21:56] accomplish IT IN ME BY THE anointing I'm
[1:21:59] under and by the power of your spirit.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; God will do it because it's his word.
[1:22:06] John 6:37, "And all that the Father
[1:22:09] giveth me shall come to me."
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:13] And him that cometh to me, I will in no
[1:22:15] wise cast out. For I came down from
[1:22:17] heaven not to do my own will, but the
[1:22:19] will of him that sent me. This is the
[1:22:20] father's will which has sent me that of
[1:22:23] all which he hath given me. Is this word
[1:22:26] hath?
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; I should I all that he hath given me I
[1:22:33] should lose nothing but should raise it
[1:22:36] up again at the last days.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he's taken care of it.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 2:9 says, "But ye are a chosen
[1:22:46] generation."
[1:22:47] Chosen.
[1:22:49] I love that word.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Chosen.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; You are a chosen generation, a royal
[1:22:56] priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar
[1:22:59] people, that you should show forth the
[1:23:01] praises of him who hath called you out
[1:23:03] of darkness into his marvelous light.
[1:23:06] I'd like to take a look at these two
[1:23:07] words, chosen generation, because you
[1:23:10] can look at it and misunderstand it. You
[1:23:12] can say, well, we're a chosen
[1:23:13] generation, which means that this is the
[1:23:15] generation, the end time, when God's
[1:23:17] going to do all the work. We're chosen
[1:23:18] to be in this generation. But that is
[1:23:21] not what this means.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; The word chosen
[1:23:27] means electtos. Sometimes you don't even
[1:23:29] have to speak Greek.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; It's the origin of our language of
[1:23:36] English, you know, through Greek to
[1:23:38] Latin and then and to English. And
[1:23:40] electtos means elect, chosen, picked
[1:23:43] out, chosen, chosen by God. So you're a
[1:23:47] chosen generation means you've been
[1:23:48] picked by God. You've been chosen.
[1:23:50] Electtos elected.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Generation means
[1:23:56] genos.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Which means race, offspring, family,
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; children, stock.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Kind.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; You are the chosen family of God.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; You are electtos genos. You come from
[1:24:13] his gene. You come from him. You're his
[1:24:16] offspring. You're his children. I was
[1:24:17] telling brother Franco about this today.
[1:24:19] He says, "You need to make a t-shirt
[1:24:20] that says I'm Altos Genos.
[1:24:25] Somebody make it for me, please. That's
[1:24:27] going to be a good shirt. That'd be a
[1:24:29] hot seller." Amen.
[1:24:31] Electto Genos, you're a chosen
[1:24:33] generation. YOU'RE NOT JUST part of the
[1:24:35] end time thing. No, you're you're PART
[1:24:37] OF GOD'S FAMILY BY CHOICE. NOT YOUR
[1:24:40] CHOICE, his choice. That's right.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; You can't choose to be a son OR DAUGHTER
[1:24:45] OF GOD. HE chooses who's his son and
[1:24:47] DAUGHTERS ARE. HE CHOSE YOU to be part
[1:24:49] of electtos go.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; He chose his own family. He chose his
[1:24:56] own bride. He chose his own offspring by
[1:24:58] by fornowledge by predestination through
[1:25:02] election. He has chosen you and I. Amen.
[1:25:05] And we're here. Amen. to respond to that
[1:25:07] choice
[1:25:09] and to surrender and yield our lives to
[1:25:12] him so that he can accomplish his
[1:25:14] purpose in our lives. If he chose us, he
[1:25:17] chose us for a purpose. That purpose he
[1:25:19] has the power to perform.
[1:25:22] Whatever he's called you to do in life,
[1:25:24] he'll give you the anointing and the
[1:25:26] power. And he's already anointed this
[1:25:28] bride under a prophetic anointing
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; just like David. And he's already Amen.
[1:25:34] through the through the opening of the
[1:25:36] word, loose the Holy Ghost in full
[1:25:38] measure to come back in the church. So,
[1:25:40] she's already under the power of the
[1:25:42] Holy Ghost.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; All we have to do is just trust in him
[1:25:48] and believe what he said and move
[1:25:51] forward like Moses moves forward.
[1:25:54] Brother B said Moses went forward with a
[1:25:56] stick in his hand and a donkey and his
[1:25:58] kids and wife on the donkey and he said,
[1:26:00] "Where are you going, Moses? I'm going
[1:26:02] to take over Egypt.
[1:26:05] How you going to do it? I don't know,
[1:26:07] but God said so.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. What are you here to do?
[1:26:11] I'm here to manifest the very life of
[1:26:13] Jesus Christ.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; How are you going to do it? I have no
[1:26:16] idea, but I believe. He told me. He
[1:26:19] called me. He's anointed me under this
[1:26:21] prophetic MESSAGE AND HE'S EMPOWERING MY
[1:26:24] SPIRIT AND WHATEVER. IF HE NEEDS TO
[1:26:26] BRING UP A GOLIATH TO PROVE HIMSELF,
[1:26:27] HE'LL BRING UP A GOLIATH and anoint me
[1:26:29] to take him out.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; But I can't do nothing. I feel like
[1:26:33] Moses. Most days we feel like Moses,
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; BUT I CAN'T SPEAK. I'M NOT ELOQUENT.
[1:26:39] THEY won't believe me. But I can't do
[1:26:40] it. But I already tried. Listen, IT
[1:26:42] DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU FEEL LIKE MOSES.
[1:26:44] You can feel like Moses every DAY OF
[1:26:45] YOUR LIFE. AMEN. BUT THE TRICK IS NOT TO
[1:26:48] NOT TO GET BOGGED DOWN IN FEELING LIKE
[1:26:49] MOSES. But to get up and move by the
[1:26:52] word of GOD AND LET GOD make a way. Let
[1:26:54] his purpose and his choosing and his
[1:26:56] word produce the works.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; MOVE FORWARD AS THE BRIDE OF JESUS
[1:27:00] CHRIST. MOVE FORWARD AS THE
[1:27:02] MANIFESTATION OF CHRIST in this age. AND
[1:27:04] DON'T WORRY ABOUT HOW. JUST BELIEVE HE
[1:27:06] WILL AND move forward.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; How are WE GOING TO DO IT? HOW IS THIS
[1:27:11] GOING TO HAPPEN? I don't know how.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; But I believe him.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; I want to finish with this scripture.
[1:27:21] For whom he did forno,
[1:27:23] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[1:27:25] to the image of his son
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; that he might be the firstborn among
[1:27:29] many brethren. Moreover, whom he did
[1:27:30] predestinate, them he also called. Whom
[1:27:33] he called, them he also justified. Whom
[1:27:36] he justified, them he also glorified.
[1:27:39] What shall we then say to these things?
[1:27:41] If God before us, who can be against us?
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; What have we to be afraid of?
[1:27:51] Amen. Let's all stand together.
[1:27:52] Musicians, if you'd come, please.
[1:27:59] Hey, listen. We don't have it figured
[1:28:00] out.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; He didn't expect us to have it figured
[1:28:03] out.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; We're not good enough. He never asked us
[1:28:06] to be good enough.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; But he chose us.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; He picked, he chose, he declared by his
[1:28:16] fornowledge. He chose
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; and and he just needs a vessel.
[1:28:24] Saul was
[1:28:26] was Saul zealous but in the wrong
[1:28:29] direction but he says he's a chosen
[1:28:31] vessel unto me not doing what he's doing
[1:28:34] now but doing what I want him to do
[1:28:37] Jesse's son David was a chosen vessel
[1:28:38] Moses was a chosen vessel brother
[1:28:40] Brandham was a chosen vessel and guess
[1:28:42] what you're just as much a chosen vessel
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; and none of these people could do it on
[1:28:48] their own none of these people can make
[1:28:50] themselves anything you can't make
[1:28:52] yourself anything
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; you can't by wanting to and trying to.
[1:28:56] You can't make yourself anything. What
[1:28:58] you are is determined by God.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't do us one ounce of good
[1:29:06] denying what we are.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Resisting and fighting against the word
[1:29:11] of God and trying to what I don't know
[1:29:14] what we're trying to do, prove
[1:29:15] something. All we're doing is making
[1:29:16] ourselves miserable.
[1:29:19] You you know when when Paul would look
[1:29:21] at somebody and says, "God is going to
[1:29:23] judge the world by my gospel."
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; That wasn't pride.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; He wasn't being pompous.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; He wasn't being arrogant. He was telling
[1:29:33] the truth.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; When he says, "I'm called to be a light
[1:29:38] unto the Gentiles."
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Man, that really sounds like
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; you really think a lot of yourself,
[1:29:45] Paul.
[1:29:46] But Paul, Paul's not the one who came up
[1:29:49] with that plan.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Paul's not the one who decided that.
[1:29:52] When David said, "God's anointed me to
[1:29:54] be a king." And you look at him, you
[1:29:55] little shrimp, you're a king. Haha.
[1:29:57] Listen, it wasn't David's idea. David
[1:29:59] wasn't doing anything wrong for David to
[1:30:01] say, "God's anointed me to be a king,"
[1:30:03] is speaking the word of God.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; FOR FOR THE APOSTLE PAUL TO SAY, "GOD
[1:30:09] WILL JUDGE THE WORLD BY MY GOSPEL. I'M A
[1:30:11] LIGHT UNTO THE GENTILES." God has called
[1:30:14] me, amen, to take the gospel to the
[1:30:16] Gentiles. HE'S NOT BRAGGING. HE'S NOT
[1:30:18] LIFTING HIMSELF UP. HE'S just telling
[1:30:20] the truth.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; AND GOD LET HIM FAIL SO MISERABLY AND SO
[1:30:24] BAD THAT WHEN it come time to declare
[1:30:26] he's apostle, an apostle of God, HE
[1:30:28] SAYS, "HEY, LISTEN. I'm not even worthy
[1:30:29] to be an apostle, but by the grace of
[1:30:31] God, I am what I am."
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; When Moses says, "I've come down to
[1:30:35] deliver you out of Egypt. I'VE COME DOWN
[1:30:37] AND GOD HAS CALLED ME TO TAKE YOU BACK."
[1:30:39] AMEN. AND GOD IS GOING TO DO MIRACLES
[1:30:41] through me. Listen. Listen. And he
[1:30:42] wasn't bragging. He was only TELLING THE
[1:30:44] TRUTH. AND FOR US TO SAY, "I BELIEVE BY
[1:30:46] FAITH AND BY GRACE. I'M PART OF THE
[1:30:48] BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST." THAT'S NOTHING
[1:30:50] BUT DECLARING THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; And we don't DO SO WITH PRIDE or
[1:30:55] arrogancy, but in humility, saying, "I
[1:30:57] MESSED MY LIFE UP. EVEN AFTER BELIEVING,
[1:31:00] I'VE MESSED EVERYTHING UP. I'VE MESSED
[1:31:01] everything that can be MESSED UP HAS
[1:31:03] BEEN MESSED UP BY ME.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; But I still believe.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; I believe what he said about me. I
[1:31:10] believe what that prophet said about me.
[1:31:12] I believe the word. And why do I
[1:31:14] believe? Because I can't help but
[1:31:16] believe.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; I didn't believe BECAUSE I CHOSE TO
[1:31:20] BELIEVE. I JUST BELIEVED.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; I KNOW THAT SOUNDS ODD, BUT IT'S THE
[1:31:26] TRUTH.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE HAD THE EXPERIENCE. IT WASN'T
[1:31:29] THAT YOU CALCULATED EVERYTHING OUT AND
[1:31:31] LAID IT ALL OUT and says, "hm, you know,
[1:31:33] the Baptists say this and the
[1:31:35] Pentecostals and but I've been reading
[1:31:36] my Bible and I talked to a few
[1:31:38] theologians and listen, I put together a
[1:31:40] flowchart
[1:31:42] AND THE MOST REASONABLE EXPLANATION FOR
[1:31:44] THE GOSPEL IS BROTHER BEN. SO, I DECIDED
[1:31:47] TO BELIEVE THE MESSAGE." THAT IS NOT HOW
[1:31:48] WE COME TO THE MESSAGE. WE COME TO THE
[1:31:50] MESSAGE BEFORE WE UNDERSTOOD IT. WE
[1:31:52] STILL HAD A MILLION QUESTIONS. PEOPLE
[1:31:54] WOULD ASK US, "WELL, WHAT ABOUT THAT?"
[1:31:55] YOU SAY, "WELL, I DON'T KNOW." WELL,
[1:31:56] WHAT about this scripture? I don't know.
[1:31:58] Well, this scripture proves trinity. HOW
[1:31:59] DO YOU DO? I DON'T KNOW. UH, BUT I STILL
[1:32:02] BELIEVE.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; We didn't come when WE FIGURED IT OUT.
[1:32:06] AND WE DIDN'T START PROCLAIMING IT
[1:32:07] BECAUSE WE HAD ALL THE ANSWERS.
[1:32:09] Something down inside of us, a seed gene
[1:32:12] OF GOD BY PREDESTINATION WAS ALREADY
[1:32:14] pre-programmed that when they heard the
[1:32:16] word like they did in the book of Acts
[1:32:18] WHEN PAUL AND BARNABAS CAME, THOSE that
[1:32:20] were ordained to eternal life, they
[1:32:22] believed. And you were chosen to believe
[1:32:25] this message. Amen.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; You didn't believe it because you
[1:32:29] decided to.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; If you decided to believe it, you'll be
[1:32:33] one of those who will leave it one day.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; I promise you that.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; But if against your will and beyond YOUR
[1:32:40] BETTER JUDGMENT AND AGAINST ALL AGAINST
[1:32:43] ALL OF YOUR resistance and
[1:32:45] intellectualism and ALL OF YOUR UH
[1:32:47] PUSHING AGAINST IT, YOU STILL BELIEVE.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:32:52] LISTEN,
[1:32:54] when David was king, anointed king,
[1:32:57] before he came into the role of king and
[1:32:59] he was being chased because of a jealous
[1:33:02] former king running him from cave to
[1:33:04] cave to cave. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT WAS NOT
[1:33:06] CONVENIENT OR PLEASANT or easy to be an
[1:33:09] anointed king.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; But he still was the anointed king.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; There's times that believing this
[1:33:17] message isn't convenient,
[1:33:20] isn't easy. It's caused pain. It's
[1:33:22] caused rejection. It's caused
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; But guess what? We still believe.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Cuz when if you decide to believe, you
[1:33:32] can decide not to believe.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; But if you never decided to believe, you
[1:33:37] just did,
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; you can't stop it.
[1:33:41] No matter how many times your heart gets
[1:33:43] broken, no matter how confusing things
[1:33:45] are, no matter how many times people
[1:33:47] show you contrary evidence,
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; you can't help it.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; I believe.
[1:33:54] Why do you believe? Because I believe.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Because I've been ordained into eternal
[1:34:01] life. Because he chosen me before the
[1:34:03] foundation of the world to believe. And
[1:34:05] I can't help it. I've been ordained
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; to believe.
[1:34:10] You know what that means?
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Then I must be part of the true seed.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; You know what else that means? That
[1:34:17] means he's whispering his love secrets
[1:34:19] in my ear.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; You know what that means? I'm a
[1:34:23] sweetheart.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Not because I'm good and not because I'm
[1:34:27] prettier, not because I'm better, but
[1:34:29] because he chose me.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Because the bride's not choosing the
[1:34:33] groom. The groom's choosing the bride.
[1:34:36] All the bride's doing is surrendering to
[1:34:38] the groom's choice.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; And I choose to surrender to the groom's
[1:34:44] choice.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; How many of you want to surrender to the
[1:34:47] groom's choice?
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Say, Lord, you can have this
[1:34:51] vessel to use. God bless you. Let's bow
[1:34:54] our heads and pray. Lord Jesus, we thank
[1:34:57] you so much for your word. God, it's a
[1:35:00] constant encouragement to our faith. And
[1:35:03] God, we realize now that we are what we
[1:35:06] are by predestination.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; God, we all have earthly parents. We
[1:35:11] have genetics. We have things that
[1:35:13] construct our facial features, our
[1:35:15] stature, some of our characteristics.
[1:35:19] But deeper than all of that is a segene
[1:35:22] of eternal life.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Something you chose, one of your
[1:35:26] thoughts, Lord, that you had of yourself
[1:35:27] before the foundation of the world. and
[1:35:30] you ordained that we would be part of
[1:35:32] your chosen generation, your chosen
[1:35:35] family.
[1:35:37] We are here, Lord, as believers,
[1:35:41] not because we chose, but because you
[1:35:43] chose. But because you chose,
[1:35:47] you can keep, you can empower, you can
[1:35:50] equip, you can overcome. Every obstacle,
[1:35:53] and every threat against our faith, you
[1:35:55] can conquer. And we're trusting in you,
[1:35:58] Lord, to keep your word in us and to
[1:36:00] keep your promise to us that we're going
[1:36:02] to make it all the way to a translation.
[1:36:06] God, we never volunteered to be your
[1:36:10] children. We never chose. You chose for
[1:36:13] us. But oh God, we surrender.
[1:36:17] We surrender in joy. We surrender and
[1:36:20] lay our lives down at your feet and say,
[1:36:22] "God, all that you said is true." And we
[1:36:25] thank you, God. Lord, we're so
[1:36:28] appreciative and so thankful. And God, I
[1:36:30] still feel like I can't, but I know that
[1:36:32] you can. And if you chose, then you've
[1:36:35] got all the power to make it come to
[1:36:37] pass. I love you, Lord. And I give
[1:36:40] myself aresh to you and ask all that you
[1:36:43] would forgive us for our falterings,
[1:36:45] Lord, for being distracted and confused.
[1:36:49] But Lord, may we come back to our first
[1:36:51] love through the quickening of our
[1:36:54] hearts, Lord, when you burned within us
[1:36:56] your truth. And may may we fan those
[1:36:59] flames of that first love and ever stay
[1:37:02] so in love with you and connected to the
[1:37:04] truth that you revealed to us that it
[1:37:07] becomes more than life to us. becomes
[1:37:09] everything, Lord. And that your word,
[1:37:12] Lord, will make a way for itself. And
[1:37:13] that you'll overcome every obstacle by
[1:37:15] yourself. That you will provide all that
[1:37:18] we have need of in this life's journey.
[1:37:20] For we're trusting in you, not in us.
[1:37:23] Because it wasn't us to begin with. It
[1:37:25] was you to begin with. So now we
[1:37:27] surrender to your purpose for our lives.
[1:37:30] We proclaim, Lord, that it's your grace
[1:37:32] that has made us what we are. And by
[1:37:35] your grace, Lord, I am what I am. Now
[1:37:38] carry us forward in your plan and use us
[1:37:40] for your glory. May we accomplish in
[1:37:43] this end time, Lord, that very purpose
[1:37:45] you've purposed us for as we surrender
[1:37:48] to you. Be with your children. Carry us
[1:37:50] forth under your anointing. You have
[1:37:53] poured out the oil of anointing through
[1:37:55] a prophetic message in this end time.
[1:37:57] And now you've poured out your spirit
[1:37:59] upon us to accomplish by your power your
[1:38:02] word. And now we're trusting in that. We
[1:38:06] ask God that you would bless us now as
[1:38:08] we move forward in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:38:12] Amen.
[1:38:13] Amen.
[1:38:16] Well, I know that I am nothinge
[1:38:20] to bear the Christian name
[1:38:25] for every blunder that I make. I've just
[1:38:30] myself to blame.
[1:38:33] But glory halleluah,
[1:38:37] I don't see them at all.
[1:38:41] And neither does my savior. For the
[1:38:45] blood has cleansed them all.
[1:38:49] In him,
[1:38:51] in him
[1:38:53] is the only place for me.
[1:38:57] I won't go back for anything.
[1:39:01] to where I used to be.
[1:39:04] The sun is always shining and the
[1:39:09] victory's been won. And I'm walking in
[1:39:14] the light of that new Jerusalem.
[1:39:21] And why do you talk of sorrow?
[1:39:25] For there is none in here.
[1:39:29] In Christ is no unhappiness.
[1:39:33] In Christ there is no fear.
[1:39:37] It doesn't seem to matter how dark it is
[1:39:42] outside.
[1:39:44] For in his shine of glory a soul is free
[1:39:50] to hide.
[1:39:51] In him, in him
[1:39:55] is the only place for me.
[1:39:59] I won't go back
[1:40:02] to where I used to be.
[1:40:06] The sun is always shining and the
[1:40:10] victory been won.
[1:40:13] and walking in the light of that new
[1:40:18] Jerusalem.
[1:40:22] And it doesn't seem to matter how this
[1:40:27] old flesh may feel. Let every man's word
[1:40:32] be alive. God's word alone is real.
[1:40:37] Oh, how my heart's rejoicing.
[1:40:40] It's all in him, not me.
[1:40:44] And glory is to him alone throughout
[1:40:49] eternity.
[1:40:51] In him, in him is the only place for me.
[1:40:58] I won't go back for anything to where I
[1:41:03] used to be.
[1:41:05] The sun is always shining. And the
[1:41:09] victory's been won. And I'm walking in
[1:41:14] the light of that new Jerusalem. Verse
[1:41:19] three.
[1:41:21] Well, it doesn't seem to matter how this
[1:41:25] old flesh may feel. Let every man's word
[1:41:30] be a lie. God's word alone is real.
[1:41:35] How my heart's rejoicing.
[1:41:38] It's all in him, not me. And the glory
[1:41:43] is to him alone throughout eternity.
[1:41:49] In him, in him, it's the only place for
[1:41:54] me. I won't go back for anything to
[1:42:00] where I used to be.
[1:42:02] The sun is always shining and the
[1:42:06] victories been won. And I'm walking in
[1:42:11] the light of that new Jerusalem.
[1:42:16] And I'm walking in the light of that new
[1:42:21] Jerusalem.
[1:42:26] Empty
[1:42:28] and broken.
[1:42:31] I came back to him.
[1:42:37] A vessel
[1:42:39] unworthy,
[1:42:42] so scarred
[1:42:44] with sin.
[1:42:46] But he did not
[1:42:49] despair.
[1:42:51] He started over
[1:42:54] again
[1:42:57] and I
[1:42:59] bless the day he didn't throw the clay
[1:43:05] away
[1:43:08] over
[1:43:10] and over.
[1:43:12] He holds me and makes me
[1:43:18] into
[1:43:20] his likeness.
[1:43:22] He fashions
[1:43:25] the clay,
[1:43:27] a vessel
[1:43:29] of honor
[1:43:33] I am today.
[1:43:37] All because Jesus
[1:43:42] didn't throw the clay away.
[1:43:47] He is the potter.
[1:43:52] I am the clay
[1:43:57] molded
[1:43:59] in his image.
[1:44:02] He wants me to stay.
[1:44:06] But when I stumble,
[1:44:08] when I fall,
[1:44:12] and my vessel breaks,
[1:44:16] he just picks up all the pieces. He
[1:44:21] never throws the clay away.
[1:44:26] Over
[1:44:29] and over
[1:44:31] he molds me and makes me
[1:44:36] into
[1:44:38] his likeness.
[1:44:41] He fashions
[1:44:43] the clay,
[1:44:45] a vessel
[1:44:48] of honor.
[1:44:51] I am today.
[1:44:56] All because Jesus
[1:45:00] didn't throw the clay away.
[1:45:05] And over
[1:45:07] and over.
[1:45:10] He molds me. He makes me
[1:45:15] into
[1:45:17] his likeness.
[1:45:19] He fashions
[1:45:22] the clay.
[1:45:24] A vessel
[1:45:27] of water
[1:45:29] I am today.
[1:45:34] All because Jesus
[1:45:38] didn't throw the clay away.
[1:45:45] I am redeemed.
[1:45:50] God with the price.
[1:45:55] Jesus
[1:45:58] has changed my whole life.
[1:46:06] If anybody
[1:46:08] asks you
[1:46:11] just who
[1:46:13] I am,
[1:46:15] you can tell
[1:46:18] I am redeemed.
[1:46:26] I am redeemed.
[1:46:31] on with the price.
[1:46:36] Jesus
[1:46:38] has changed my whole life.
[1:46:45] If anybody
[1:46:48] asks you
[1:46:51] just who I am,
[1:46:58] I am redeemed once more.
[1:47:04] Will I ever redeem?
[1:47:10] But with the Christ
[1:47:15] Jesus
[1:47:17] has changed my whole life.
[1:47:24] If anybody
[1:47:27] asks you
[1:47:29] just who I am,
[1:47:33] you can tell them
[1:47:37] I am redeemed.
[1:47:43] Lead me Lord
[1:47:45] and I will follow.
[1:47:50] Lead me, Lord,
[1:47:53] and I
[1:47:55] will go.

[1:48:06] Lead me, Lord,
[1:48:09] and I
[1:48:11] go. Verse one.
[1:48:15] It's hard to take the first step when I
[1:48:20] don't know the way.
[1:48:23] Each turn is so unertain,
[1:48:27] but I learned to walk by faith.
[1:48:32] You gave me a promise
[1:48:35] that you would never leave.
[1:48:40] You will lead and guide me Lord. I do
[1:48:46] believe.
[1:48:49] Lead me Lord
[1:48:52] and I will follow.

[1:49:15] and I will go.
[1:49:21] Your plans for me are perfect.
[1:49:26] I never need to fear.
[1:49:30] For though at times I feel alone, I know
[1:49:34] that you are near.
[1:49:38] My heart just wants to follow.
[1:49:42] I'm willing to obey.
[1:49:46] Take my hand and lead me. I'll follow
[1:49:51] all the way.
[1:49:55] Lead me, Lord,
[1:49:58] and I will follow.

[1:50:22] and I
[1:50:24] will go.
[1:50:28] Your plans for me are perfect.

[1:50:36] For though at times I feel alone, I know
[1:50:41] that you are near.
[1:50:44] My heart just wants to follow.
[1:50:48] I'm willing to obey.
[1:50:52] Take my hand and lead me. I'll follow
[1:50:58] all the way.

[1:52:00] and I
[1:52:02] will go.
