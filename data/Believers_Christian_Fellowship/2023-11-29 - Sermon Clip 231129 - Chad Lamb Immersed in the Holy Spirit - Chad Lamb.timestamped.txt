[0:00] the message of leadership he says the
[0:01] choice of your conduct you can't mix it
[0:04] now you're either for God or against God
[0:07] and the outward expression shows exactly
[0:09] what's on the
[0:10] inside many of you think I got the
[0:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to
[0:14] heaven that don't mean one thing that
[0:16] you're going to heaven no sir you can
[0:19] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every
[0:22] hour in your life and still be lost and
[0:24] go to
[0:26] hell I hope this doesn't confuse you
[0:28] because I've been talking about the
[0:29] baptism hly ghost quicking the seed but
[0:31] now we're going to show more in depth
[0:33] we're going to get a good clear picture
[0:35] of this of this teaching you can have
[0:37] the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour
[0:40] in your life and still be lost and go to
[0:42] hell the Bible says so that's exactly
[0:45] right look here you are an outside
[0:47] person you have five senses that
[0:49] contacts the outside body God gave you
[0:51] five senses not to contact him your
[0:54] Earthly home seed taste feel smell and
[0:55] here then you have a spirit on the
[0:58] inside of that and it has five Outlets
[1:00] conscience and love and so forth five
[1:01] Outlets that you contact the spirit
[1:03] world with but with your spirit your
[1:06] physical contacts the physical your
[1:08] spiritual context is spiritual but
[1:10] inside of that you got a soul and that
[1:13] soul is the gene that come from
[1:16] God what's brother benam telling us he's
[1:19] telling us that you can have the baptism
[1:20] of the Holy Ghost you can be immersed in
[1:23] the Holy Ghost but the immersion of the
[1:25] Holy Ghost is there to Quicken a seed on
[1:28] the inside but if there's no seed on the
[1:30] inside you can still be immersed in the
[1:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost but that
[1:35] immersion will not bring a new birth
[1:37] because there's nothing inside to
[1:39] Quicken but it's not that it's not an
[1:41] immersion it's an a baptism of the Holy
[1:43] Ghost it's an immersion in the Holy
[1:45] Ghost but it's not an immersion that
[1:46] brings a new birth that's why he said if
[1:48] you have the true baptism of the Holy
[1:50] Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:52] is the new birth brings the fullness of
[1:55] Christ inside and seals you because it
[1:57] brings to life the seed that's laying
[1:59] there yeah but if there's no seed there
[2:02] you can still be immersed you're
[2:04] submerged in the Holy Ghost and have
[2:08] manifestations and Gifts the gifts and
[2:10] callings of God are without repentance
[2:12] amen it doesn't you don't even have to
[2:14] be born again to manifest those gifts
[2:16] you can manifest those gifts and if
[2:17] they're laying in you amen the immersion
[2:20] of the Holy Gift can bring out the gifts
[2:21] and they can begin to operate and
[2:23] operate correctly and operate spot on
[2:25] that's still no evidence you're born
[2:28] again right amen you're only born again
[2:32] when the predestinated C Gene of God
[2:34] comes to life by the immersion of the
[2:35] Holy Ghost that's the new birth and the
[2:37] evidence is you're changed amen and the
[2:40] evidence is you take all the word all
[2:42] the way and you never leave
[2:44] it right than you lord it's why it can
[2:48] be so deceiving coming out of a
[2:49] Pentecostal Revival and having those
[2:51] thoughts mixed in amen we have to have
[2:54] the true understanding there's nothing
[2:56] wrong with the gifts the gifts are
[2:57] perfect the gifts are good the gifts are
[2:59] meant to be here they still need to be
[3:00] in operation not a thing wrong with them
[3:03] nothing wrong with Sensations and
[3:04] experiences we want those and we want
[3:07] more of them amen but we have to know
[3:09] what the new birth actually is because
[3:11] you can have Sensations in meetings you
[3:13] can get excited you can get enthused you
[3:15] can even have manifestations but unless
[3:18] something inside of you is quickened to
[3:20] life you've not been born again
