[0:00] if you've ever bought a car or bought a
[0:02] house uh there's a witness you ever
[0:04] notice that there's never a transfer of
[0:07] ownership from one hand to another
[0:09] unless there's Witnesses present right
[0:12] you get a notary public and he's he's
[0:14] identified by the the local governments
[0:16] as a true witness one that can be
[0:19] trusted to oversee this transfer of
[0:22] ownership from the hands of one to the
[0:24] hands of another and so if there's going
[0:27] to be Witnesses on the scene there must
[0:29] be going to a great transfer here of
[0:32] responsibility and ownership from one's
[0:34] hand to another's hand and if I would
[0:37] like to recall to your mind take the
[0:39] book eat the book out of the hand of him
[0:42] that sth so there's going to be a great
[0:44] transfer of responsibility here as
[0:48] brother brandham said in Jesus's Mount
[0:50] Transfiguration when he said this was
[0:51] his adopted moment he said now father
[0:54] could sit down and rest his son would
[0:56] complete the work and so now we know
[0:59] that God is wanting to take a rest he's
[1:01] waiting for your witnesses to arrive on
[1:03] the scene to witness the transfer of
[1:05] ownership and to enforce redemptions
[1:09] rights and those Witnesses very simple
[1:12] faith hope and
[1:16] charity not how well you understand the
[1:18] Seven
[1:19] Seals a living epistle being read of all
[1:22] men a life lived a life expressed taking
[1:28] the book and eating the book and
[1:30] thundering out the mystery of Christ in
[1:32] your own life that's the Thunder I think
[1:35] prophet of God said the voice of what a
[1:37] thousand lived lives
[1:41] read and so these Witnesses must be on
[1:44] the scene there's also another time that
[1:46] you bring Witnesses on a scene it's in a
[1:48] court case have
[1:50] judge if you're on a prosecution or
[1:53] defense both sides produce Witnesses
[1:56] both against and or for and we know when
[2:00] Jesus was condemned to death they
[2:01] brought forth false Witnesses because
[2:04] see death could not be pronounced unless
[2:06] there was
[2:08] Witnesses but we also know that in
[2:12] 1963 when that cloud came down it was
[2:15] the white wigged one the judge for the
[2:18] judge is here to enforce redemption's
[2:20] rights and if redemption's rights is
[2:22] changing hands from him that sth upon
[2:24] the throne to him that was told to take
[2:26] the book and eat the book and prophesy
[2:28] again there must must be three Witnesses
[2:31] witnessing and enforcing life amen
[2:36] testim testifying that life is here as
[2:40] there was false witnesses to condemn him
[2:42] there is true Witnesses here to testify
[2:45] that life has come to you and to me and
[2:51] those Witnesses are faith hope and
[2:54] charity
