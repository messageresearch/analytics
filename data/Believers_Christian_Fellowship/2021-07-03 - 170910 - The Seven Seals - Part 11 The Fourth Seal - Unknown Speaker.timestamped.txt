[0:00] let's turn what we're standing to the
[0:01] book of daniel chapter 12.
[0:07] you know we live in an amazing time the
[0:09] west coast is burning up by
[0:11] fires we've had a hurricane that hit
[0:15] texas that left the worst flooding in
[0:17] u.s history
[0:18] and if you're paying close attention to
[0:19] the news there's something that you keep
[0:21] hearing over and over again
[0:23] the worst unprecedented never before
[0:27] not in 100 years i mean it's like
[0:30] how many records can we break it's
[0:33] every catastrophe breaks a record every
[0:36] disaster breaks a record
[0:37] because it's birth pains friends you
[0:40] know and these birth pains began
[0:42] after the seals were opened brother
[0:44] branham goes back out west and he
[0:46] and he picks up a stone according to the
[0:48] commandment of the lord and he throws it
[0:49] in the air
[0:50] and when it does he he prophesies that
[0:53] there's judgment coming and
[0:55] and it starts a whirlwind that goes up
[0:57] and there's a there's an earthquake amen
[0:59] that hits alaska
[1:00] and that was the first shock of birth
[1:02] pains
[1:03] and instilled on record as the the
[1:05] largest earthquake ever recorded in
[1:08] in the history of man on this earth and
[1:10] and so
[1:11] so now that started birth pains and from
[1:14] there
[1:14] they start coming in greater intensity
[1:18] and closer frequency greater intensity
[1:21] and closer frequency and for 50 some
[1:23] years 52 years now we've been watching
[1:26] the birth pains increasing and now we
[1:28] come to a place where the contractions
[1:30] are continuous
[1:32] and they're more intense than they've
[1:34] ever been before what is it
[1:36] this earth is about to birth forth a
[1:38] millennium
[1:40] it's about to renovate amen for the
[1:42] honeymoot period of the bride and groom
[1:44] and
[1:45] and the the baby's coming the baby's
[1:47] coming everything that you see
[1:49] in the news is telling you it's coming
[1:51] amen
[1:52] we're going to meet the lord in the air
[1:54] and this earth is going to be renovated
[1:56] for the honeymoon period
[1:57] and that's what the news is telling you
[2:00] amen that's what the
[2:01] newspaper articles and the and the news
[2:03] reports they're telling you
[2:05] that birth pains are continuous the
[2:07] contractions are
[2:09] are off the off the charts off the
[2:11] scales and they're coming
[2:12] every few minutes
[2:15] and i say it's going home time
[2:18] we know what time we live in well you
[2:21] know harvey produced the worst
[2:23] flooding in u.s history and and now they
[2:26] said this
[2:27] that this hurricane now irma was the
[2:29] strongest ever recorded
[2:31] in the atlantic outside the caribbean
[2:32] and had the longest sustained
[2:34] 185 mile an hour is the worst
[2:36] everything's the worst
[2:39] because we've come to birth pains
[2:42] and i say god make me ready
[2:46] for that meeting in the air let's look
[2:49] at
[2:49] daniel we're going to continue on in the
[2:51] seals today i'm going to look at the
[2:52] fourth seal by the grace of god
[2:54] let's look at daniel chapter 12. we've
[2:57] read this several times but i want to
[2:58] keep this fresh
[2:59] in our memory as we go through this
[3:03] you have to excuse me i'm i'm fighting
[3:05] lying vanities this morning
[3:08] and they're nothing but lying vanities
[3:10] and uh it's almost like
[3:12] the the devil didn't like camp but i
[3:14] don't care what he liked and what he
[3:16] didn't like and i don't care what he
[3:17] tries to do to punish afterwards
[3:19] i liked it and i'm going to keep liking
[3:22] it
[3:22] and today's is going to be a
[3:24] continuation of the same amen rejoicing
[3:26] in the word of god i don't care what he
[3:28] does
[3:29] amen nail me to a cross i don't care you
[3:32] can't take away this joy in my heart you
[3:34] can't take away my victory amen
[3:36] you can't steal back the ground that i
[3:38] have gained
[3:40] amen verse 8 daniel 12 and 8.
[3:46] and i heard but i understood not then
[3:48] said i
[3:49] o my lord what shall be the end of these
[3:51] things
[3:52] and he said go thy way daniel for the
[3:54] words are closed up
[3:56] and sealed till the time of the end so
[3:59] we know that this
[4:00] prophecy has been sealed until the time
[4:02] of the end
[4:03] so when we see the time of the unsealing
[4:05] of this then we know we're at the end
[4:10] many shall be purified and made white
[4:12] and tried but the wicked
[4:14] shall do wickedly and none of the wicket
[4:15] shall understand but the wise
[4:18] shall understand how many want to
[4:20] understand
[4:22] it makes you part of the wise let's pray
[4:24] heavenly father we thank you lord for
[4:26] this word we just pray now lord as we
[4:29] look into your word that you would open
[4:31] it to us lord
[4:32] we can read words on paper but that
[4:34] doesn't mean much lord
[4:36] if you don't come and reveal it to us by
[4:38] your own supernatural presence lord
[4:40] it's just words on paper it's just it's
[4:43] just something that was pinned long ago
[4:45] but
[4:45] the lord it's more than that to us lord
[4:47] and by your revelation you've made it
[4:49] more than that to us
[4:51] and i pray god that you would just
[4:52] reveal it to us today open our
[4:54] our eyes of understanding equip us lord
[4:57] and strengthen us by your word
[4:59] we give you preeminence in this place
[5:00] and ask that you would take this vessel
[5:02] and use it for your glory in jesus
[5:05] christ's name we pray
[5:06] amen you can be seated
[5:11] let's turn to the book of revelation
[5:14] chapter 5.
[5:19] excuse me so that we know in daniel
[5:23] daniel saw
[5:24] something and and he wanted to know
[5:28] what all these things were but he was
[5:29] told that it was sealed up
[5:31] until the time of the end so we get to
[5:34] the book of revelation which is the last
[5:35] book of the bible
[5:36] and we're gonna see where this is
[5:38] unsealed
[5:40] let's look at chapter five verse one
[5:42] revelation chapter five verse one
[5:44] and i saw on the right hand of him that
[5:46] sat on the throne a book written within
[5:48] and on the back side
[5:49] sealed with seven seals and i saw a
[5:52] strong angel proclaim with a loud voice
[5:54] who was worthy to open the book and to
[5:56] loose the seals thereof
[5:59] and no man in heaven nor on earth
[6:02] neither under the earth was able to open
[6:03] the book neither to look thereon and i
[6:06] wept much because no man was found
[6:08] worthy to open and to read the book
[6:10] neither to look thereon and one of the
[6:12] elders saith unto me weep not behold the
[6:15] lion of the tribe of judah the root of
[6:17] david
[6:17] hath prevailed to open the book and to
[6:19] loose the seven seals thereof
[6:21] and i beheld and low in the midst of the
[6:23] throne and the four beasts and in the
[6:25] midst of the elder stood a lamb as it
[6:27] had been slain having seven horns and
[6:29] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[6:31] of god
[6:32] sent forth into all the earth and he
[6:34] came and took the book out of the right
[6:36] hand of him that sat upon
[6:38] the throne so this book was a
[6:41] sealed book and these things were sealed
[6:43] up till the time of the end
[6:45] then at the time of the end we see that
[6:47] that that the title deed of redemption
[6:49] the ownership of all creation is placed
[6:52] back in the hands of god
[6:53] but god never had to write himself a
[6:56] title
[6:56] deed because god's the creator of
[6:59] everything he's the originator of it he
[7:01] doesn't need a title deed amen
[7:03] he doesn't need a document to document
[7:05] his ownership
[7:06] he's owner because he created he's the
[7:09] ultimate owner amen
[7:11] so he doesn't need a document he doesn't
[7:13] need anybody to witness it he's the one
[7:15] who created everything if there's a
[7:16] witness he created the witness
[7:19] so it all belongs to him so this book in
[7:21] his hand is not for him
[7:23] he's just holding it until somebody can
[7:26] fulfill
[7:26] the right of redemption the kinsmen
[7:28] redeemer and take the book out of his
[7:30] hand
[7:30] because he originally gave it to man in
[7:32] the garden of eden
[7:34] he gave it to adam to be god over the
[7:36] earth to have dominion over all the
[7:38] earth
[7:38] and he was he was placed on the earth as
[7:40] the god
[7:41] of the creation amen but when he fell
[7:45] by disbelieving and disobeying the word
[7:48] of god
[7:48] when he fell by his disobedience to the
[7:50] word then he
[7:51] lost the rights to be god upon the earth
[7:54] and now that title deed went from his
[7:57] hands
[7:57] back to the original owner and satan
[8:00] tried to grab it but his dirty hands
[8:02] couldn't hold it is what
[8:03] is what the word tells us his dirty
[8:05] hands could not hold that
[8:06] so it went back to god so now we see him
[8:09] here holding this book but he's not
[8:11] holding it for himself
[8:12] he's not opening it and reading it he
[8:14] knows what's in it amen
[8:16] he has the book is not for him amen
[8:20] the book is for a man the book is for
[8:24] his children his sons amen and so now he
[8:27] has to wait
[8:28] until one of them comes in a condition
[8:30] that's able to pay the price of
[8:32] redemption
[8:33] to buy back claims and rights to take
[8:36] that book
[8:37] and so here we see him in revelations
[8:39] chapter 5
[8:40] he's able now to come forth as the lamb
[8:43] that had been slain
[8:44] having lived a perfect life fulfilling
[8:47] all the law of god
[8:48] and now he has rights to claim
[8:50] redemption claims
[8:52] and he goes and he has a right to take
[8:54] the book
[8:55] out of the hand of him who holds it
[8:58] this is amazing nobody can come there
[9:01] unworthy nobody can come be so
[9:03] bold as to walk up and take from god
[9:06] that book but this
[9:07] was god in flesh this was the flesh man
[9:10] of god
[9:11] and he lived a perfect life and he died
[9:13] so that he had rights
[9:14] when when his time of kinsmen redeemer
[9:16] work is over
[9:17] now it's time for him to come and claim
[9:19] what he has been redeeming
[9:21] now he's able to come forth and take the
[9:23] book out of the hand of him that sat
[9:25] upon the throne oh praise god
[9:30] that reminds me of another taking of the
[9:32] book
[9:34] see john when they when the mighty angel
[9:37] called who is worthy to come and take
[9:40] the book and loose the seals
[9:41] john began to weep because nobody in
[9:44] heaven or on earth and under the earth
[9:46] nowhere was there anybody found worthy
[9:49] to take that
[9:50] book and john must have realized that if
[9:52] nobody can open this book
[9:54] all claims to creation are lost that
[9:57] means the squatter gets to remain
[9:59] on the earth as king as the prince of
[10:01] the power of the air
[10:03] the god of this evil age
[10:06] and so john just couldn't bear to see
[10:09] that satan would win over
[10:11] over the word of god that satan would be
[10:12] the victor over the children of god
[10:14] but yet now there's one that can come
[10:16] and take it but nobody else in heaven
[10:19] nobody else on earth nobody else under
[10:21] the earth could touch the book or
[10:23] even look at it
[10:28] but we see something else take place in
[10:30] revelations chapter 10.
[10:33] and in revelations chapter 10 we see
[10:35] this mighty angel come down
[10:37] with an open book in his hand not a
[10:39] sealed book
[10:40] he's already opened the seals amen he's
[10:42] already revealed it through the seventh
[10:44] church age messenger
[10:46] and now he comes with an open book in
[10:47] his hand in this same book that nobody
[10:50] was worthy to touch
[10:51] nobody was worthy even to look therein
[10:56] now he makes a cry to john
[10:59] and says go and take the book
[11:03] out of the hand of the mighty angel
[11:06] oh my goodness something had changed
[11:08] from revelation
[11:10] 5 to revelation 10 there is a
[11:12] significant change that takes place
[11:15] now uh a man amen who is
[11:18] who was born in sin shaped an iniquity
[11:21] one who came in a hybrid condition who's
[11:24] not worthy before
[11:25] to look at the book to touch the book or
[11:27] even look there on
[11:29] now he's told to go and take the book
[11:32] from the angel this is what redemption
[11:37] has done for you and i
[11:38] the thing that we've forbidden to even
[11:40] look upon the thing that was sealed to
[11:42] daniel he said daniel it's sealed go thy
[11:44] way
[11:45] amen are revealed at the end now it
[11:47] comes to a place where you're told now
[11:49] to take the book
[11:53] and john walks up to the mighty angel
[11:56] and he says
[11:57] give me oh he doesn't say please he
[12:00] doesn't say
[12:00] if you may oh if if you're not too upset
[12:03] with me
[12:04] he knows now that he has rights to the
[12:07] book
[12:07] john was standing there john was
[12:10] watching the scene in revelation 5
[12:12] when nobody was worthy john was there
[12:14] and he wasn't worthy
[12:16] and he was weeping because he wasn't
[12:19] worthy no one was
[12:20] worthy nobody could take this book but
[12:22] now the same
[12:23] john who was not worthy to take it when
[12:25] the lamb takes the book
[12:27] and loses the seals now john's told to
[12:29] go to the angel
[12:30] and he walks up to the angel when john
[12:32] was weeping before because he couldn't
[12:35] now he goes up and says give me the book
[12:40] hallelujah you're taking these
[12:43] redemption claims taking this word back
[12:45] into yourself
[12:46] you don't have to beg you don't have to
[12:48] ask pretty please
[12:49] it's been given to you it is yours to
[12:51] take you need to go
[12:53] boldly amen and take it amen
[12:57] not timid not oh if you could only
[13:00] oh if you could just have mercy on me oh
[13:02] if you could please god
[13:04] i'm a worthy i'm a worthless oh you
[13:06] you've always been worthless you were
[13:08] just as worthless as john was worthless
[13:10] in revelation 5.
[13:11] he couldn't do it either it had nothing
[13:13] to do with john's merit had everything
[13:15] to do with the lamb
[13:18] and because the lamb took the book the
[13:20] lamb overcame
[13:21] the lamb opened the seals now john in a
[13:24] hybrid condition can go
[13:26] and take the book and eat the book
[13:30] and prophesy again
[13:33] oh friends we don't have to beg
[13:38] if we're children of god we can come to
[13:40] that mighty angel which is christ
[13:42] and say give me the revelation of this
[13:45] book
[13:45] give me the understanding that you've
[13:47] promised you told daniel to shut up to
[13:50] the time of the end
[13:50] but you've unleashed it now at the end
[13:53] and it's open and you said
[13:55] that john could go and take the book if
[13:57] john could take the book
[13:58] i can take the book if john could eat
[14:00] the book i can eat the book lord give me
[14:02] amen when when when caleb came into his
[14:05] inheritance
[14:06] he was already told that there was a
[14:08] portion for him
[14:09] he was already told what he would get
[14:11] when he comes into the land
[14:12] so when he comes now to joshua which is
[14:14] a type of the holy ghost
[14:16] he comes up now and he says give me my
[14:19] mountain he doesn't say could i please
[14:22] have or could we talk about this
[14:24] could we negotiate for a little while he
[14:26] was already told it was his
[14:28] he was already told that he could
[14:29] possess it and now when the time comes
[14:32] he doesn't ask he commands give me
[14:35] my mountain
[14:38] and this word is your mountain friends
[14:42] it's been given to you
[14:46] we have to take it
[14:49] we have to it has to be precious to us
[14:52] it has to be worth something to us we
[14:55] have to be able to go
[14:57] in contact with the mighty angel himself
[15:00] and say give me the book
[15:04] lord reveal to me what you've promised
[15:06] to reveal
[15:08] open my eyes to see your plan of
[15:10] redemption because you promised it
[15:12] it's for me i come
[15:16] to take the book hallelujah
[15:20] can we open up the powerpoint please
[15:25] praise the lord so we want to look at
[15:28] the fourth seal
[15:29] and we'll do a quick recap so we all
[15:31] stay on the same page
[15:33] but we see we've got a sealed document
[15:36] and here let's go to
[15:39] revelation chapter 6.
[15:43] i don't i don't believe we could ever
[15:46] go over this enough
[15:50] it's like every time we read through it
[15:51] it gets richer i've been so
[15:54] fascinated with the book of revelation
[15:56] over the last
[15:57] maybe year maybe six months to a year i
[16:00] just keep reading through it
[16:01] and reading through it and reading
[16:03] through it because this is the capstone
[16:05] of the bible
[16:06] this is the revelation of jesus christ
[16:09] amen
[16:10] this is this is capping off the entire
[16:12] word
[16:13] it's just a thrill to me to read it
[16:15] revelation 6 and 1
[16:17] and i saw when the lamb opened one of
[16:19] the seals and i heard as it were the
[16:21] noise of thunder and one of the four
[16:22] beasts saying come and see
[16:24] and i saw and behold a white horse and
[16:26] he that sat on him had a bow
[16:28] and a crown was given unto him and he
[16:30] went forth conquering and to conquer
[16:32] and when he had opened the second seal i
[16:34] heard the second beast say
[16:36] come and see and there went out another
[16:38] horse that was red and power was given
[16:40] to him that sat there on to take peace
[16:42] from the earth
[16:43] and that they should kill one another
[16:44] and there was given unto him
[16:46] a great sword and when he had opened the
[16:48] third seal i heard the third beast say
[16:50] come and see
[16:51] and i beheld and lo a black horse and he
[16:53] that sat on him had a pair of balances
[16:55] in his hand
[16:56] and i heard a voice in the midst of the
[16:57] four beasts say a measure of wheat for a
[17:00] penny and three measures of barley for a
[17:01] penny
[17:02] and see thou hurt not the oil and the
[17:04] wine
[17:05] and when he had opened the fourth seal i
[17:07] heard the four the voice of the fourth
[17:09] be say come and see
[17:11] and i looked and behold a pale horse and
[17:13] his name that sat on him was death
[17:15] and hell followed with them and power
[17:18] was given unto them over the fourth part
[17:20] of the earth to kill with the sword
[17:22] and with hunger and with death and with
[17:24] the beast of the earth
[17:26] amen that's our fourth seal now we find
[17:28] that
[17:29] as the lamb is breaking the seals back
[17:32] here when
[17:32] when john's having the vision when he's
[17:35] breaking the seals
[17:36] he's only showing it in a symbol form
[17:40] we're only seeing a white horse that
[17:42] goes out
[17:43] amen and he was given a crown and he had
[17:45] a bow with no arrows
[17:47] and we see to combat him the beast that
[17:49] was to announce it was the
[17:51] the lion because that was the one that
[17:52] was mentioned first before in revelation
[17:54] 4 around the throne
[17:56] the lion and and then comes the red
[17:58] horse and then comes the ox and
[18:00] and it's all symbology we're seeing the
[18:02] symbols
[18:03] of what this means but yet we're not
[18:05] having the clear understanding of what
[18:07] it represents
[18:09] only the symbology so we go over to
[18:11] revelations 10 let's read this together
[18:13] in revelations 10
[18:22] 10 and 1 and i saw another mighty angel
[18:24] come down from heaven clothed with a
[18:26] cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[18:28] and his face was as it were the sun and
[18:30] his feet as pillars of fire
[18:32] and he had in his hand a little book
[18:34] open and he set his right foot upon the
[18:36] sea
[18:37] and his left put upon the earth he's
[18:39] taking complete
[18:40] dominion over creation right foot upon
[18:44] the land
[18:44] and left foot upon the earth right foot
[18:46] on the sea left foot upon the earth
[18:48] and cried with a loud voice is when a
[18:50] lion roareth when he had cried
[18:52] seven thunders uttered their voices and
[18:54] when the seven thunders had uttered
[18:56] their voices
[18:56] i was about to write and i heard a voice
[18:59] from heaven saying unto me
[19:00] seal up those things which the seven
[19:02] thunders uttered and write them not
[19:04] and the angel which i saw stand upon the
[19:06] sea and upon the earth lifted up his
[19:08] hand to heaven
[19:09] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[19:11] ever who created heaven
[19:13] and the things that therein are in the
[19:14] earth and the things that therein are
[19:16] and the sea and the things that which
[19:18] are therein that there should be
[19:20] time no longer but in the days
[19:23] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[19:25] he shall begin to sound
[19:27] the mystery of god should be finished as
[19:29] he had declared to his servants
[19:31] the prophets so we find the pattern in
[19:35] scripture we have a sealed book
[19:38] and then the lamb takes the book and
[19:40] breaks the seals but yet because it was
[19:42] not the end of the
[19:44] at the end of time when john saw this
[19:46] vision it wasn't time
[19:47] for these things to be revealed yet he
[19:49] could only break the seal in symbolic
[19:52] form
[19:53] so you could see a white horse and a
[19:55] lion and you could see a red horse and
[19:56] an ox
[19:57] and you could see all these symbols so
[19:59] that it would be in the word because we
[20:01] know once this word is sealed at the end
[20:03] that you cannot add one word or take one
[20:05] word from it
[20:06] but yet these things had to be sealed up
[20:08] till the time of the end
[20:10] so there's got to be at the very end of
[20:12] time there's got to be a a
[20:14] prophet that will come on the scene and
[20:16] break the revelation of what
[20:18] daniel wanted to understand what was
[20:20] sealed until the time of the end
[20:22] so now it's got to lay down in symbol
[20:24] form so that the prophet can come and
[20:26] preach out of the scriptures
[20:29] because we can't add the word he said
[20:31] don't add to or take away from the words
[20:33] of this prophecy
[20:34] so it's got to be laying in there so he
[20:36] reveals it in symbol form
[20:38] but then when the mighty angel comes
[20:40] down with the open book
[20:42] he utters seven thunders there's voices
[20:44] of seven thunders
[20:45] and it's the revelation of what the
[20:47] symbols were
[20:51] and john was told in the beginning of
[20:52] the book everything which you see
[20:55] write down so as soon as we get there
[20:57] john decides
[20:58] he's going to keep doing what he's been
[20:59] doing he's going to write down what the
[21:01] seven thunders had uttered
[21:03] and he begins to write he's told don't
[21:05] write it
[21:07] now we see what was revealed sealed
[21:10] again
[21:12] so the thunders become the second set of
[21:15] seals amen the seals on the back side of
[21:18] the book
[21:18] the it was unsealed in in symbol form
[21:22] but then when it was revealed in the
[21:23] thunders it was sealed again
[21:26] but then when brother branham would come
[21:28] amen by commissioned by an
[21:30] angels to come back and preach the seven
[21:32] thunders because that's what the seven
[21:34] seals was
[21:34] was the preaching of the seven thunders
[21:36] and he came and he preached each one of
[21:38] those seals
[21:39] what the symbol mean and he broke it
[21:41] down through the scriptures
[21:42] and that was the voice of the seven
[21:45] thunders amen
[21:46] he was breaking the seals on the
[21:48] backside of the book
[21:52] it was the lamb who broke the seals
[21:56] every day an angel would come to him
[21:58] every day
[21:59] and give him the revelation of what the
[22:01] symbolic meaning was
[22:03] and that was the preaching of the seven
[22:05] thunders
[22:07] and after that verse 8 and the voice
[22:12] which i heard from heaven spake unto me
[22:14] again and said go
[22:15] and take the little book which is open
[22:17] in the hand of the angel which standeth
[22:19] upon the sea
[22:20] and upon the earth and i went unto the
[22:22] angel and said unto him give me the
[22:24] little book
[22:24] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[22:26] up and it shall
[22:28] it shall make thy belly bitter but it
[22:29] shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey
[22:32] and i took the little book out of the
[22:33] angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[22:35] my mouth sweet as honey
[22:36] and as soon as i had eaten it in my
[22:38] belly was bitter
[22:40] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[22:42] again before many peoples and nations
[22:44] and tongues and kings
[22:48] so we have a daniel who wants to see
[22:51] something but it's sealed
[22:53] then we see the sealed book in
[22:54] revelation 5 and the hand of sin unto
[22:56] him that sits on the throne
[22:57] then the lamb takes it and breaks it in
[22:59] symbol for him then the thunders come
[23:01] and he's told not to not to write what
[23:04] the thunder said
[23:06] but then we have a prophet and the last
[23:07] day comes and he tells us
[23:09] what john heard what john saw
[23:13] and now the book has been opened
[23:17] and then when the book is open you can
[23:21] take it
[23:22] and eat it
[23:26] the breach between the seven churches
[23:27] and the seven seals the prophet says
[23:29] it's thus saith the lord i'll read it to
[23:31] you out of the book the sounding of the
[23:33] seventh angels message the mystery of
[23:35] god should be
[23:36] finished that's been declared by his
[23:37] holy prophets
[23:39] that's the prophets who has wrote the
[23:40] word at the sounding of the seventh
[23:42] church age the last church age
[23:44] all the loose ends that through these
[23:46] church ages had been probed at
[23:47] will be wound up together and when the
[23:49] seals are broken the mystery is revealed
[23:51] down comes the angel the messenger
[23:54] christ
[23:55] setting his foot upon the land and upon
[23:56] the sea with a rainbow over his head
[23:58] now remember the seventh angels on earth
[24:01] at the time of this coming
[24:03] i love this quote what does this tell
[24:06] you
[24:07] christ is here the mighty angel has come
[24:11] down
[24:11] amen christ is here hallelujah
[24:15] hallelujah
[24:16] that means everything to us you can't be
[24:19] married in the invisible union
[24:21] unless he's here amen you can't be
[24:23] united to christ unless he's here
[24:25] amen but he's here not in a measure he's
[24:28] in a full portion he's here
[24:30] he's hearing the fullness of his word
[24:31] with the full spirit that comes with it
[24:33] he's here
[24:34] not in corporal body but but he was
[24:36] there he was alive before there was a
[24:38] corporal body
[24:39] he was in existence before there was a
[24:42] baby born in a manger
[24:43] he was there amen whatever form he was
[24:46] there and he was there
[24:47] and then he made himself a body to dwell
[24:49] in and though that body remains sitting
[24:51] up there as a memorial for atonement
[24:54] he has come himself amen
[24:57] that's why we're not married to a
[24:58] prophet we're not joined
[25:00] amen to eliezer we've been united to
[25:03] isaac amen to the son
[25:06] that's why we're now married in the
[25:08] invisible union amen of the bride
[25:11] we're united with him in the visible
[25:13] union but soon and very soon we're going
[25:15] to be united in the visible union amen
[25:17] and the meeting in the air and going to
[25:19] the marriage supper of the lamb
[25:21] hallelujah this means everything to us
[25:24] this means your husband is here
[25:26] you can be married to him now we don't
[25:28] have to wait for something else to
[25:30] happen
[25:30] he's here now and he's come here to join
[25:32] himself with the bride
[25:35] hallelujah in the breach again he says
[25:38] the whole thing together makes the book
[25:40] and it's sealed with seven seals and
[25:42] being it's on the back side is because
[25:44] it's wound up the seal mysteries on the
[25:46] inside
[25:47] and only says the white horse rider or
[25:49] the black horse rider and whatever more
[25:51] on the outside
[25:52] but the mystery of the whole book is in
[25:54] them seals from
[25:55] genesis to revelations a complete plan
[25:59] of redemption is revealed
[26:00] in those seven seals hallelujah
[26:05] and the seals are open
[26:09] hallelujah i love to declare that and
[26:11] the seals
[26:12] are open
[26:16] if they weren't open then the mighty
[26:18] angel couldn't come down
[26:21] if they weren't open you couldn't take
[26:23] the book and eat it they weren't open
[26:24] the seven thunders couldn't be revealed
[26:26] if they weren't open then you can't be
[26:27] married to christ
[26:30] they have to be open friends
[26:33] we want to take a look at two vines
[26:37] satan in christ this is very important
[26:40] because this is the narrative that
[26:42] this is the battle that we're caught and
[26:44] this is the narrative that we've come to
[26:45] understand
[26:46] said the the greatest battle ever fought
[26:48] this great first battle that was ever
[26:50] fought begin in heaven
[26:51] when michael and his angels fought
[26:53] against lucifer and his angels
[26:55] it first started and the first battle
[26:56] was in heaven so sin did not originate
[26:59] on earth
[26:59] it originated in heaven so we've got to
[27:02] be careful when we start talking about
[27:04] original sin we've got to be careful
[27:06] because original sin did not originate
[27:08] in the garden of eden
[27:09] that's only when it originated with man
[27:12] but amen original sin
[27:13] originated in heaven there was sin in
[27:16] heaven before there was sin on earth
[27:18] so the original sin is in heaven and the
[27:21] original
[27:22] center is lucifer
[27:25] that's important to know because you
[27:27] have to know who your enemy is amen and
[27:29] it's important to know
[27:31] that the original center was lucifer
[27:33] because brother branham tells us
[27:35] that when we come to the true atonement
[27:36] amen the atonement the blood of jesus
[27:38] christ
[27:39] is like clorox bleach amen and he said
[27:42] you can take a drop of black
[27:44] ink and drop it in the bleach and it'll
[27:46] send it right back to its original
[27:48] elements and he said now when you come
[27:50] through the
[27:51] the clorox bleach of the blood of jesus
[27:53] christ it takes your sin
[27:55] and it puts it back on the originator of
[27:58] sin
[27:58] which is satan himself
[28:02] you don't know how wonderful that is
[28:04] maybe you do but it's going to get more
[28:06] wonderful with time
[28:08] because we realize i i just i'm just
[28:10] going to
[28:11] divert for just a few minutes here and
[28:13] say you realize
[28:14] now when a sinner goes down with his sin
[28:16] when he comes up at the judgment he
[28:18] comes up with his sin
[28:20] and then he must stand judgment for the
[28:22] sins that he went down with
[28:24] he comes up and he faces judgment for
[28:26] his own wrong
[28:27] but when a child of god who's come
[28:29] through the atonement when he goes
[28:30] when he goes if he goes through the
[28:32] grave he comes forth in the resurrection
[28:34] and the first resurrection
[28:35] and he doesn't even go to the judgment
[28:37] because he has no sin
[28:40] but the way the prophet taught us amen
[28:42] it's not that your sin
[28:43] vanishes away and is no more your sin
[28:46] has been removed from you as far as the
[28:47] east is from your west
[28:48] but the sin remains
[28:52] because god is not the kind of judge
[28:54] that overlooks things
[28:57] god doesn't overlook anything amen god
[28:59] is a righteous god and his law
[29:01] if there's a if there's no penalty then
[29:03] there's no law and there's a penalty for
[29:05] his law and every infraction of the law
[29:07] must be penalized
[29:09] or else he's not a just god it means
[29:11] he's not god
[29:13] if he doesn't give a just penalty for
[29:15] every
[29:16] crime so he cannot just
[29:20] vanish your sin away and make it
[29:22] disappear he can't do that
[29:24] but what he does is he removes it from
[29:26] you and he puts it back to the
[29:28] originator of sin
[29:30] and now all of your sin rests on the
[29:32] shoulders of satan himself
[29:34] and in the judgment he's going to stand
[29:35] judgment for everything he tricked you
[29:38] into doing
[29:39] because you never sinned in the first
[29:41] place you come from god you're not a
[29:43] sinner and when you're born again by the
[29:45] spirit of god you've come back to your
[29:47] virgin condition
[29:48] just as if you've never done it because
[29:51] in the beginning you didn't do it
[29:53] in the beginning he did it and he's
[29:55] going to have to pay
[29:57] and the only people on this planet that
[29:59] is making him pay for his crimes
[30:01] are those who come through the atonement
[30:04] you see god needs you on this earth you
[30:08] say why did god let me fail and why did
[30:10] i come to this condition and why
[30:12] until i was 40 years old did i hear the
[30:14] truth why not as a baby
[30:16] because the only people that are going
[30:18] to make lucifer stand for his crimes
[30:21] are those that have come through the
[30:22] atonement and the sins that was on
[30:25] them that he tricked them into he is
[30:27] going to have to answer in the day of
[30:29] judgment for
[30:30] so why did god let it happen so he has
[30:32] something to judge
[30:34] the serpent form that should make you
[30:38] happy
[30:40] all those mistakes the things that make
[30:42] you cringe the things that
[30:44] you're so ashamed of when you think
[30:45] about it don't be ashamed anymore
[30:48] because god has erased it from your
[30:49] record it's just as if you have never
[30:52] done it
[30:52] in the mind of god you never have done
[30:55] it but who did it
[30:56] he did it and he's going to answer for
[30:59] it
[31:00] he's going to stand at the day of
[31:02] judgment and everything he's accused you
[31:04] for
[31:05] remember in the book of esther haman
[31:07] hung on his own gallows
[31:11] and in the day of judgment amen when the
[31:13] queen is sitting with the king
[31:15] amen this haman is going to hang on his
[31:17] own gallows
[31:18] the ones he built to take down the
[31:20] children of god is going to be the very
[31:22] thing that takes him down
[31:26] i love that friends so now why did god
[31:29] let bad things happen
[31:31] god knows what's happening he's not
[31:34] afraid because he knows what's on the
[31:35] inside
[31:37] god's not god's not pleased with sin
[31:40] he's not enjoying
[31:41] the sin but he knows that there's a seed
[31:43] on the inside
[31:45] and he knows all i have to do is in the
[31:47] right time
[31:48] all i've got to do is get light to that
[31:50] seed and it'll come forth in newness of
[31:52] life
[31:52] and they'll come to the true atonement
[31:54] which in this day is the word
[31:56] and they'll come to the true atonement
[31:57] for their day and i will strip
[31:59] all that off of their record and it will
[32:01] be transferred to the record of lucifer
[32:04] himself
[32:05] why does he fight you why does he hate
[32:07] you because you're you're going to make
[32:08] sure he gets punished
[32:10] and you're the only ones on the planet
[32:12] that are going to make sure he gets
[32:13] punished
[32:16] i like that thought
[32:19] amen those things that make you shudder
[32:22] when you think about them in the past
[32:24] when satan gives you a flashback of
[32:27] something that you had did that was
[32:28] horrible and that you regret so bad
[32:30] when you shudder just remember on the
[32:32] day of judgment i'm not going to be the
[32:34] one shuddering
[32:36] i'm not going to be the one ashamed he's
[32:39] going to be the one who's shaking
[32:41] he's going to be the one shuddering
[32:43] because he did it
[32:44] in the first place i didn't
[32:48] god's taking us by the new birth back to
[32:50] our original condition
[32:52] and my original condition is perfectly
[32:55] sinless and whole
[32:57] hallelujah so sin did not originate on
[33:00] earth that originated in heaven
[33:02] and it was thrown down from heaven cast
[33:04] out of heaven to the earth and
[33:06] fell on human beings then the battle
[33:08] from angels became
[33:10] human battles so think about this
[33:13] what battle are you fighting
[33:17] that what was started in the heavens
[33:19] amen when lucifer rebelled against god
[33:22] and deceived a third of the angels and
[33:23] war broke out in heaven
[33:25] that battle has moved down into eden and
[33:28] it moved from
[33:29] angelic from from angels and it became
[33:32] human battles this is the same war
[33:36] you're fighting in the same war that
[33:39] broke out in heaven
[33:40] not a different war not a second war
[33:43] you're fighting in the same
[33:45] war because it started there
[33:49] and it spilled down into this creation
[33:51] and now
[33:52] it become human battles and satan come
[33:55] to destroy god's creation
[33:56] what god had created to be for himself
[33:59] he had satan come to destroy this
[34:01] that's what this purpose was to destroy
[34:03] it then the battle began here on earth
[34:06] and begin in us
[34:11] and has been raging ever since when the
[34:14] battle moved to earth
[34:16] and we say it moved to eden it didn't
[34:19] move to just eden in general
[34:21] it came down to eden and the battle went
[34:23] one place
[34:25] it went to the woman
[34:28] and he began to reason with her and
[34:31] began to
[34:32] entice her and begin to seduce her and
[34:35] then the battle began
[34:37] in her and now the battle came from
[34:41] heaven
[34:42] and it came down to earth but it's not
[34:44] as though the battle
[34:45] has fallen all over the face of the
[34:48] earth the battle
[34:49] is in us
[34:53] that makes it awful close to home
[34:55] doesn't it
[34:56] don't forget you've been placed here to
[34:58] overcome
[35:00] you've been put here to defeat the devil
[35:05] it says in the seventh seal it's an old
[35:07] battle that started way back beyond time
[35:10] and when satan and his angels was kicked
[35:12] out and they come to earth and the
[35:13] battle set in again
[35:16] because eve broke down the barrier from
[35:17] where she was isolated behind the word
[35:19] of god
[35:20] and from that very hour satan won the
[35:22] battle over god's word
[35:24] we'll stop right there what did satan
[35:28] win the battle over
[35:30] god's word
[35:33] what's the whole what's the whole war
[35:35] over
[35:36] god's word if lucifer rebelled
[35:40] what did he rebel against he rebelled
[35:43] against god's word
[35:45] amen you can't have rebellion unless
[35:47] you're rebelling against the commandment
[35:50] if there's no commandment there's no
[35:51] rebellion so he's rebelling against the
[35:54] word of god
[35:54] and the battle amen is not over you the
[35:57] figure you
[35:58] see in the mirror the battle is over the
[36:00] word that you contain within you
[36:02] amen and as long as he could get the
[36:05] woman to let down on the word
[36:07] satan won the battle over the word
[36:12] amen because he broke down the barrier
[36:15] from where she was isolated behind the
[36:16] word of god
[36:17] and from that very hour satan won the
[36:20] battle over god's word
[36:21] because one of his subjects the weaker
[36:24] let down the bar
[36:25] and that's exactly how he's won the
[36:27] battle every time
[36:28] has been because one of his subjects let
[36:30] down the bar
[36:32] from the word now this is going to get
[36:35] really close to home now so now the
[36:38] battle
[36:39] that was raging in heaven came down to
[36:42] earth
[36:42] and the battle come in us
[36:45] right and he said when
[36:49] one of his subjects let down the bar on
[36:52] the word
[36:53] satan had victory over the word of god
[36:58] and as long as one subject
[37:01] i'm going to ask you how many of the
[37:03] attributes of god does satan have to
[37:05] defeat to defeat god one
[37:09] satan only has to defeat one attribute
[37:11] of god to defeat god
[37:13] and if god has portioned himself out in
[37:16] this age and he's placed himself
[37:18] out as sons and daughters of god all he
[37:20] has to do is overcome
[37:22] one of those attributes and he's
[37:23] overcome god
[37:25] and when one of his subjects with that
[37:27] word inside of them the word of life
[37:29] when they let down on the word satan
[37:31] again has victory over the word of god
[37:34] and that's why he sits as a squatter on
[37:36] this earth and that why
[37:37] that's exactly why he is the god of this
[37:39] evil age is because
[37:41] one subject let down on brother brenham
[37:43] said one word
[37:47] just added one word surely
[37:50] and because of that addition of one word
[37:53] amen
[37:54] the the the the satan won the victory
[37:57] over the word of god and brother bram
[37:59] said how do you think you're going to
[38:00] get back
[38:00] doubting one word
[38:04] let down on one word how are you going
[38:05] to get back how are you going to get
[38:07] back
[38:08] doubting one word that's why the seals
[38:11] have been opened that's why the word has
[38:13] been restored
[38:14] because this bride is not supposed to be
[38:16] in deception anymore
[38:18] she's not supposed to be
[38:19] misunderstanding the word but the word
[38:21] has been restored so that she can
[38:22] believe the word
[38:23] and in faith in the full word of god
[38:26] when you get all of those subjects
[38:27] brother baby said when you get all of
[38:29] them together
[38:30] in one place what's it going to be then
[38:33] he doesn't mean one place like
[38:35] albuquerque new mexico or one place like
[38:37] new york he means one place in the
[38:39] revelation of the word when this bride
[38:42] gets to one place
[38:43] in the revelation of the word what's it
[38:45] going to be then it's going to be the
[38:46] very thing that overcomes satan
[38:51] and so now we realize that the whole
[38:55] battle
[38:57] in heaven and the whole battle
[39:00] that's spelled out on earth the whole
[39:03] war
[39:04] between satan and the word of god comes
[39:07] down to one person
[39:10] me
[39:13] you when one of the subjects let down on
[39:18] one word
[39:21] one subject let down on one word
[39:24] satan had the victory over the word of
[39:27] god
[39:29] but god is determined there's going to
[39:32] come a time
[39:34] there will not be one subject let down
[39:36] on one word
[39:38] that's why he sent his word and with the
[39:40] word came the full life of jesus christ
[39:43] to back it up
[39:44] amen and we've got to get to the place
[39:46] where we receive the word
[39:47] and receive the word and trash our own
[39:50] thinking and forget about our own ideas
[39:52] and just keep feeding on the word and
[39:54] let the revelation comes and the life of
[39:56] it to live itself out
[39:57] until there's no more deception in the
[39:59] bride that she's not falling by
[40:02] lucifer's deception she's not falling by
[40:04] her own thinking but she's standing
[40:06] on thus saith the lord she has the word
[40:08] and just dust said the lord
[40:10] or she keeps still
[40:13] that's what we're coming to and that's
[40:15] the thing that will defeat satan
[40:16] not when you get a little bit happier
[40:19] and not not when you run around some
[40:20] more
[40:21] not when you get more excited but when
[40:23] you come to the full manifestation of
[40:24] the full word
[40:25] when that life of jesus christ is on
[40:27] full display
[40:28] and there's no more letting down on the
[40:30] word there's no more
[40:32] compromising with the world there's no
[40:34] more letting down on the word
[40:36] then we're going to have absolute
[40:37] victory over the enemy
[40:39] and there's a people coming to that
[40:41] brother bam said that's gonna shave you
[40:42] down a lot he said it shaves me down a
[40:44] lot but we need
[40:45] shaved down a lot because we're coming
[40:47] to what the image of jesus christ on the
[40:50] earth again
[40:51] and jesus christ was not a compromiser
[40:53] with the word he wasn't a disbeliever of
[40:55] the word
[40:55] he wasn't playing games with the word of
[40:57] god but he was completely sold out to
[40:59] the will of god
[41:00] he was led by the spirit of god
[41:02] completely he had thus saith the lord or
[41:05] he kept still
[41:08] and we're coming to the same thing
[41:12] oh my we sit here and we think
[41:15] how that rules me out that doesn't rule
[41:18] you out
[41:19] because it's not you that does it
[41:21] friends amen
[41:23] it's just like it's just like whenever
[41:25] we go down this path it's nothing but
[41:27] the enemy that would take us and say
[41:29] well
[41:29] that rules me out i can't overcome if it
[41:31] was based on you overcoming we'd all be
[41:33] in trouble
[41:35] because you can't overcome you can't
[41:37] defeat the devil
[41:38] you can't in your own flesh when amen
[41:40] it's got to be something that god does
[41:42] through
[41:43] you amen it's receiving the spirit and
[41:45] brother bannon said the word
[41:47] and the spirit are the self same thing
[41:49] that's why the word was restored
[41:51] that's why you've got 1200 tapes that's
[41:54] why you've got the opening of the seals
[41:56] is so that you can receive what you have
[41:57] need of to have victory in this day
[41:59] it's not you it's him
[42:03] but how are we going to get there with
[42:05] sunday wednesday only
[42:08] how are we going to get there amen if
[42:10] we're not
[42:11] hungry for the word of god if we have no
[42:14] prayer life to find out what he wants us
[42:16] to do with the word if we have no
[42:17] communion with the lord
[42:19] remember brother branham come and it was
[42:21] the voice
[42:22] of the seventh angel in the days of the
[42:24] voice of the seventh angel
[42:25] so if you just look at the recorded
[42:27] messages
[42:29] because that's the voice that's what was
[42:30] left
[42:32] it starts with the foundation of faith
[42:35] in 1947
[42:36] the first recorded sermon we have is
[42:38] faith is the substance
[42:41] where does it end 1965 communion
[42:47] the message is to bring you from the
[42:48] foundation of faith to communion with
[42:50] god
[42:53] it's not you it's the word that's been
[42:56] restored that's why we become one with
[42:59] the word that's why we eat the book
[43:01] it's not your efforts it's not your
[43:02] willpower it's not your strength
[43:04] it has nothing to do with you it has
[43:06] everything to do with him
[43:10] all we can do is surrender
[43:13] i'm so glad he's not depending on me to
[43:15] overcome because i would make a big mess
[43:17] of it
[43:19] but he's going to do this himself that's
[43:21] why the mighty angel
[43:23] came down
[43:29] amen praise the lord
[43:33] let's get a little further
[43:36] i just feel like i want to kill that
[43:38] demon forever
[43:41] because the minute we start talking
[43:43] about full life of jesus christ
[43:45] and the very minute he becomes what
[43:47] comes to you whispering here you'll
[43:48] never make it
[43:49] you're not going to be good enough you
[43:51] don't have the power to overcome
[43:53] that's a lying devil that's the hiss of
[43:55] the serpent that has nothing to do with
[43:57] the scriptures
[43:58] you'll never find that in the word of
[44:00] god it has nothing to do with the word
[44:02] of god
[44:02] it is nothing but a lie because when we
[44:06] go down that path
[44:07] the very thing that we're doing is we're
[44:09] rejecting the atonement
[44:13] and that's what satan wants us to do is
[44:14] reject the atonement as if the lamb
[44:16] wasn't enough
[44:18] as if the blood of god being shed
[44:21] through jesus
[44:22] christ was wanted not enough to erase
[44:24] you of all sin
[44:25] and all guilt and make you spotless and
[44:27] virtuous and pure
[44:28] the virgin bride of jesus christ as if
[44:31] you had to add something to it
[44:34] see but that's exactly the lie you're
[44:36] beginning to believe
[44:37] when you go down and say well i can i
[44:39] never will and i never he you already
[44:41] have friends
[44:42] because you were with him when he was
[44:44] mailed to the cross you've already paid
[44:46] for all your crimes
[44:47] you already have overcome when when you
[44:50] were in
[44:51] him amen you were crucified
[44:54] with him amen and you have already paid
[44:57] you have already overcome that's nothing
[44:59] but a devil whispering in your ear and
[45:01] he's lying
[45:02] and he's trying to get you to lose
[45:04] confidence in the atonement
[45:09] brother brahm said he's not looking at
[45:11] you
[45:13] he only hears your voice coming through
[45:14] the blood
[45:16] he's looking at the lamb
[45:19] but all the devil wants you to do is
[45:21] look at you but god's not looking at you
[45:24] but the devil wants you to look at you
[45:26] but i'm not looking at me i'm looking at
[45:28] the lamb
[45:30] he was enough and if he's been restored
[45:34] in this day
[45:35] it's enough and if i've received the
[45:38] baptism of the holy ghost
[45:39] it's enough it's going to overcome
[45:42] my job now is just to crucify myself
[45:46] my my task is to lay my life down that's
[45:49] where my labors are that's where my work
[45:51] is
[45:52] is to die and to get up in the morning
[45:53] and die and an hour later die
[45:55] and five minutes later die again and
[45:58] keep dying and keep giving up and keep
[46:00] surrendering
[46:00] that's where all my work is but it's all
[46:03] every every bit of overcoming is going
[46:04] to be what he does right through me
[46:08] remember the battle is in you
[46:11] hallelujah it moved from heaven
[46:14] now it's in you
[46:18] praise the lord so we want to look at
[46:21] the battle plan
[46:22] this is how lucifer works
[46:26] he comes in as a white horse and he
[46:28] begins in compromise
[46:31] remember the white horse it looks like
[46:33] christ but it's not christ
[46:35] it looks innocent but it's not innocent
[46:37] and we see
[46:38] it's compromise it's a slight change
[46:40] from the word and it looks good it
[46:42] doesn't look bad
[46:43] satan never shows up and knocks on your
[46:45] door and says i got some heroin here you
[46:47] want to become an addict today
[46:50] it doesn't happen that way he comes in
[46:52] and it looks good
[46:53] and it looks like a good thing it looks
[46:55] like it'll be beneficial
[46:56] and he always starts that way but
[46:58] remember he has no crown he's given a
[47:00] crown
[47:01] and he has a bow with no arrows he can
[47:03] do you no harm amen
[47:05] this is the place where you stop him
[47:10] why was god so happy with phineas
[47:15] or phineas or however you say his name
[47:19] remember when balaam tricked them amen
[47:22] and he deceived
[47:23] he taught balak how to cast the
[47:25] stumbling stone before israel
[47:27] and he deceived them into joining
[47:28] together in the feast of baal piar
[47:31] and and they began to mingle together
[47:33] and they began the israelites began to
[47:35] mix amen mixing's always been a deadly
[47:38] thing
[47:39] god has always hated mixing him he hated
[47:41] it when the serpent mixed with the woman
[47:43] and he's hated mixing ever since and so
[47:46] now on this feast of baal pr he teaches
[47:48] them the mix amen
[47:50] they're mixing the religion and now now
[47:52] now the
[47:53] sons of god start to take the the
[47:55] moabite daughters and
[47:56] and the israelites take them and they
[47:58] come into their tent
[47:59] and finesse didn't wait for a council he
[48:02] didn't wait amen he didn't wait for a
[48:03] couple weeks to see how he felt about it
[48:05] later
[48:06] he picked up a javelin he ran into the
[48:08] tent and he thrust them through the men
[48:10] and the woman together
[48:11] and god loved it
[48:15] god wasn't angry about that god loved it
[48:18] why
[48:18] finesse when he saw it he acted the
[48:21] minute he saw it he killed it
[48:24] we need some daddies like that at home
[48:27] we need some mommies like that at home
[48:29] when they see it they kill it amen throw
[48:31] a javelin through that thing and don't
[48:32] be afraid to kill it
[48:34] because it starts off white and innocent
[48:36] and it and it comes in and you're like i
[48:38] don't know
[48:39] is it really harmful hey if you're in
[48:41] doubt throw it out
[48:44] if there's a question don't move forward
[48:46] because that which is done without
[48:48] faith is sin
[48:51] we need some mommies and daddies that'll
[48:53] throw the javelin the first time they
[48:55] see it
[48:55] and not wait and see what happens or see
[48:58] what this monster becomes down the road
[49:00] because once it's in it's a lot harder
[49:02] to get out than it is to stop it at the
[49:03] gate
[49:05] hallelujah so he looks good and he
[49:08] comes in through deception and comes in
[49:11] with just
[49:12] a slight compromise then he moves on
[49:17] but god sent a beast to combat
[49:21] the white horse and the beast that he
[49:23] sent was the lion
[49:25] and the lion is the pure word of god
[49:28] amen
[49:28] in the first age it was the apostle
[49:30] paul's teaching which became most of the
[49:32] new testament
[49:35] and then we see next he comes with the
[49:37] red horse now we recognize
[49:39] that this horse rider we've been through
[49:41] this i'm just doing a review
[49:42] this horse rider he doesn't want to stay
[49:46] on the white horse
[49:48] right he has no desire to stay on the
[49:51] white horse
[49:52] the white horse is just his entry point
[49:54] into your life but once he moves gets in
[49:56] there with the white horse he wants
[49:58] to change horses amen his plan is to get
[50:01] to the fourth horse which we'll talk
[50:02] about today
[50:03] that's been his desire all along as to
[50:05] get to the fourth horse
[50:08] and this red horse takes peace brings
[50:11] war
[50:12] and his killing he has a sword
[50:15] you'll find out that as soon as
[50:17] compromise comes into your life
[50:19] it'll begin to create war in your
[50:21] relationships
[50:22] it'll begin to take your peace from your
[50:25] own spirit
[50:26] and things get all warlike inside
[50:30] but god sent something to battle the red
[50:34] horse
[50:35] and that was the ox oh hallelujah
[50:39] the ox is self-sacrifice the ox is dying
[50:43] to yourself
[50:44] amen bearing burdens and giving up your
[50:47] rights
[50:48] see laodicea's people's rights but you
[50:50] know what
[50:51] i'm happy to give mine up i'm happy to
[50:55] give
[50:55] all my rights up because for the glory
[50:57] that lay ahead
[50:58] i'll endure whatever cross that the lord
[51:00] has for me for the glory that lays ahead
[51:04] we see that the third seal and the third
[51:07] beast
[51:08] or the third horse is the black horse
[51:10] and this is spiritual control and you
[51:12] see these moving down through the church
[51:13] ages
[51:15] and brother branham shows us back down
[51:16] the church ages and shows how each one
[51:18] of these
[51:18] horse riders came and how they deceived
[51:20] the church and the condition
[51:22] that it got in and they come into
[51:24] complete spiritual control through the
[51:25] spirit of nicolaitanism the
[51:27] laity had no rights they had no word now
[51:30] is under complete control and dominance
[51:32] and it moved to the dark ages in a
[51:34] spiritual
[51:35] famine and friends if you stay
[51:39] with this horse rider long enough he
[51:41] will bring you to spiritual famine
[51:45] he will bring you to a dry place where
[51:47] your spiritual life is all dried up
[51:49] but praise be to god there's a solution
[51:54] when he come on the black horse god sent
[51:56] another
[51:57] beast anointing to combat that and it
[51:59] was the man anointing
[52:00] and he had the oil and the wine which is
[52:03] the holy spirit is the oil and the wine
[52:04] is the stimulation of revelation
[52:06] and he used a man for his intellect and
[52:08] his wisdom but it's not man's intellect
[52:10] and wisdom it's only symbolic
[52:12] of the wisdom of god that came the
[52:14] spiritual revelation of the word
[52:18] now let's get to the fourth seal
[52:21] let's just read that again if you're in
[52:23] revelation let's go to revelation 6 and
[52:25] we'll read that and pick up from here
[52:29] revelation 6 verse 7. now i'll warn you
[52:32] now this is a
[52:33] huge seal
[52:36] we'll not take our time today but we'll
[52:38] take our time over the next several
[52:39] weeks praise the lord
[52:41] amen but we're just going to stay on it
[52:44] as long as god opens it up to us and
[52:46] gives us something
[52:46] amen will stay with him we just want to
[52:49] introduce it today
[52:51] in verse 7 and when he had opened the
[52:53] fourth seal i heard the voice of the
[52:54] fourth beast saying come and see
[52:56] and what was that fourth beast it was an
[52:58] eagle a flying eagle
[53:01] and i looked and behold a pale horse and
[53:02] his name that sat on him was death
[53:05] and hell followed with them and power
[53:06] was given unto him over the fourth part
[53:08] of the earth
[53:09] to kill with the sword and with hunger
[53:11] and with death
[53:12] and when the beasts of the earth so this
[53:15] is the first time
[53:16] that the horse rider is named and we
[53:18] find out that he's been coming changing
[53:20] horses amen
[53:22] and and once he changes off that horse
[53:23] that horse continues to ride
[53:25] brother branham says it rides on out but
[53:27] he changes so the white horse keeps
[53:29] riding
[53:30] he changes the red horse he goes to the
[53:32] black whereas the red horse keeps riding
[53:33] changes to the pale horse the black
[53:35] horse keeps writing these things don't
[53:36] leave they're still working in the
[53:38] church they're still working in our
[53:39] lives
[53:40] because the battle moved from heaven to
[53:43] earth
[53:44] in us that's why
[53:47] that's why we need to understand these
[53:49] things because the battle is right here
[53:51] friends
[53:53] so in the fourth seal right at the
[53:55] beginning right
[53:57] in the very beginning chap or paragraph
[53:59] three he says so happy to be back in the
[54:01] house of the lord tonight in service
[54:03] again
[54:04] i'm so happy just thought this one
[54:06] wouldn't come
[54:07] but it finally did and so i'm so
[54:09] thankful that being the last of those
[54:11] four horse riders
[54:12] which i think is one of the main
[54:14] messages to the church
[54:15] at this time so we're getting friends to
[54:18] the
[54:19] one of the main messages to the church
[54:21] at this time
[54:22] which is this fourth seal
[54:25] we'll find out that the four seal is the
[54:27] wrap up of everything
[54:29] in the church ages and the third series
[54:33] is now let's background
[54:34] this just a little bit on the seals that
[54:36] we have passed
[54:37] because just like in the church ages why
[54:39] we tried to give a background to kind of
[54:41] lap it over
[54:42] to you because that's the way the ages
[54:43] are actually in scripture one lapse the
[54:45] other
[54:46] one over just like that like climbing a
[54:48] ladder and
[54:49] or climbing a step rather one running
[54:51] down to the other and coming back like
[54:53] that as you go up a step
[54:55] so he's telling us these seals lap over
[54:57] one another
[54:58] when god moves he doesn't come down like
[55:01] he did in the church ages
[55:02] he doesn't come down as a meat cleaver
[55:04] and this one stops and this one starts
[55:06] but there's a little overlap between
[55:07] them and he said it's like going up
[55:09] steps
[55:09] so the seals are the same way this is
[55:12] important to know in the fourth seal
[55:14] because when we get to the fourth seal
[55:16] much of what happens in the fourth seal
[55:18] to the fourth horse rider
[55:19] happens in the tribulation period
[55:21] happens after the rapture of the saints
[55:23] but not all of it some of it happens now
[55:26] so it's like going up this ladder
[55:28] so we're going to look at that and see
[55:30] that as we go
[55:32] so the four fourth horse is the pale
[55:34] horse
[55:35] and here he's named a
[55:38] spiritual death the incarnate
[55:42] devil in the fourth seal
[55:46] says the fourth stage of the writer
[55:48] watched the fourth stage of this writer
[55:50] is called
[55:50] death death means eternal separation
[55:54] from god that's what death means to be
[55:56] eternal
[55:57] separated from god
[56:00] this is this is important this is the
[56:03] fourth seal
[56:04] this is what the horse rider is named
[56:07] now remember
[56:08] there's only two spirits at work in the
[56:10] world
[56:12] there's the true and the false amen
[56:15] there's satan in christ there's only two
[56:18] there's only ever been two
[56:19] that's why there's always twins through
[56:20] the bible amen when it was
[56:22] when it was it was time for children to
[56:24] come upon the earth you have cain and
[56:25] abel
[56:26] at the time of jesus you have judas and
[56:28] jesus you always have these twins that
[56:30] go all the way through
[56:32] the scriptures so we find out that
[56:33] there's only two spirits at work in the
[56:35] world today
[56:36] it's the antichrist spirit and the
[56:37] spirit of christ
[56:40] and so when the antichrist spirit rides
[56:43] out on these
[56:44] horses he goes from white to red to
[56:46] black to pale
[56:47] and when he gets to pale all of a sudden
[56:49] he's named because until you get to the
[56:51] eagle age
[56:52] there's a mystery who this is but the
[56:54] mystery is going to be solved in the
[56:56] eagle age
[56:57] when the eagle anointing comes which is
[56:59] a prophetic anointing
[57:00] the eagle anointing with eyes that can
[57:02] see afar off that can fly high and see
[57:04] he's going to look down and he's going
[57:06] to see and he's going to be able to say
[57:08] this is this and this is that and this
[57:10] is this why because he's the prophet
[57:12] of the age and so he comes down and he
[57:14] says this same writer who's been writing
[57:16] this is none other than death
[57:19] what is death death is the opposite of
[57:21] life
[57:23] so he's named his death only on the one
[57:26] of two spirits the antichrist spirit
[57:29] and the fourth seal he says no wonder he
[57:31] could impersonate himself in the
[57:33] persona personified name called death he
[57:36] sure was
[57:37] god only knowed how how many he calls to
[57:39] spiritually die
[57:41] by his anti-bible word teaching look at
[57:43] this cause to spiritually
[57:45] die this is the one he put
[57:48] 68 million to the sword and killed and
[57:51] probably literally
[57:52] billions died spiritually on his false
[57:56] teaching
[57:57] no wonder he could take the name of
[57:59] death
[58:01] there's only two ways death and life
[58:05] there's only two spirits the antichrist
[58:07] and the christ
[58:08] hallelujah
[58:17] like he give egypt he give egypt a place
[58:20] to repent what was the last plague
[58:23] was death that's the last plague that
[58:25] hit the pentecostal church
[58:27] it's spiritual death she's dead that's
[58:29] in the name of the lord
[58:30] she's spiritually dead he's not saying
[58:34] will be
[58:36] the prophet here is standing remember
[58:38] he's bridging the gap between two ages
[58:41] he comes at the end of the laodicean
[58:43] church age and he's bridging the gap to
[58:44] the bride age
[58:45] and he's now declaring that the
[58:47] pentecostal church
[58:48] is spiritually dead she's
[58:52] dead he said that's in the name of the
[58:55] lord
[58:56] she's spiritually dead he gave her place
[58:58] to repent and she rejected it
[59:01] now she's dead she'll never rise
[59:04] again that's why the atonement amen
[59:08] can only be found in the message of the
[59:10] hour
[59:11] because the the the pentecostal age amen
[59:14] that that pentecostal church that came
[59:16] out of the piccolo
[59:16] is dead is spiritually dead there's no
[59:19] life to be found there
[59:21] all of the denominational systems are
[59:23] dead it's under the pale horse but we've
[59:25] moved now into the eagle age where the
[59:27] eagle can now say
[59:29] the only one who could say is the eagle
[59:31] and the eagle standing here says
[59:33] it's dead
[59:37] there's a great secret we want to get to
[59:39] before we wrap up today
[59:41] just hang with me remember here see
[59:44] death is eternal separation remember
[59:46] saints don't die
[59:51] how many saints do we have in here that
[59:54] means you can't come to the fourth horse
[59:55] rider friend
[59:56] that means you cannot come to spiritual
[59:59] death because you
[1:00:00] you're not amen you're you're a child of
[1:00:03] god you can never come to death why
[1:00:05] because the seed inside you already has
[1:00:07] life
[1:00:08] and that seed can never come to death
[1:00:10] because it already has
[1:00:12] life oh this gets good
[1:00:16] they sleep not die he that heareth my
[1:00:18] words and believeth on him that sent me
[1:00:20] has eternal life that's right shall not
[1:00:22] come into the judgment but is passed
[1:00:24] from death and to life
[1:00:25] i am the resurrection and life said
[1:00:27] jesus he that believeth in me though he
[1:00:29] were dead
[1:00:30] yet shall he live and whosoever liveth
[1:00:32] and believeth
[1:00:33] in me shall never die
[1:00:36] lazarus dead he sleepeth fear not the
[1:00:39] girl is not
[1:00:39] dead but sleepeth they laughed him to
[1:00:41] scorn is that right oh my
[1:00:43] see saints don't die separation from god
[1:00:46] is death eternal death
[1:00:47] and this fellow is called death friends
[1:00:50] you can never be eternally separated
[1:00:52] from god
[1:00:54] because when god portioned the portion
[1:00:56] of himself out and dropped it in your
[1:00:57] soul
[1:00:58] amen brother brahma said you can no more
[1:01:00] be lost and god can be lost
[1:01:02] because god cannot lose himself you can
[1:01:05] never you're not in fear
[1:01:06] you don't have to tremble worrying about
[1:01:08] coming to this fourth horse rider
[1:01:09] you never will
[1:01:12] you're predestinated not to
[1:01:16] you'll never come to eternal separation
[1:01:17] from god god is here
[1:01:19] he's gathering you back to himself not
[1:01:21] sending you away
[1:01:22] but gathering you to himself
[1:01:26] hallelujah come to the eagle anointing
[1:01:32] and the eagle is god himself
[1:01:35] oh this is good i don't even know
[1:01:39] amen
[1:01:42] all right god himself
[1:01:46] the prophet prophets
[1:01:49] and the children of god this is the part
[1:01:53] that i want to leave this is what i
[1:01:54] wanted to open the door to
[1:01:56] how many times did you hear brother
[1:01:58] branham tell the story about the eagle
[1:02:00] egg under the chicken
[1:02:03] would you say this is a major story that
[1:02:06] he tells and a major theme of his
[1:02:07] ministry
[1:02:09] i think i would i would call that a
[1:02:11] major theme of his ministry
[1:02:14] it's something that he told i can't even
[1:02:15] tell you how many times i never even
[1:02:17] tried to look it up
[1:02:18] but it's got to be dozens and dozens of
[1:02:20] times he told this story
[1:02:21] now you have to ask yourself why is the
[1:02:23] prophet of the age so attracted to this
[1:02:25] story
[1:02:27] it's a parable friends
[1:02:30] he's bringing in the eagle age now
[1:02:33] remember the eagle is different than all
[1:02:35] the other beasts
[1:02:37] every one of those other beasts are land
[1:02:40] bound creatures
[1:02:41] the lion the ox the man every one of
[1:02:44] them start on milk
[1:02:46] every one of them nurse from their
[1:02:47] mother they're all
[1:02:49] they all live and they all they all live
[1:02:52] their life in their existence on the
[1:02:53] ground
[1:02:54] but the eagle's completely different
[1:02:58] the eagle amen is a heavenly bird
[1:03:02] a heavenly beast the eagle is built to
[1:03:05] fly
[1:03:06] not to stay but to go the eagle age has
[1:03:10] not come
[1:03:10] for us to stay but the eagle anointing
[1:03:13] has come for us to go
[1:03:15] it's the flying away anointing it's the
[1:03:17] leaving the earth anointing
[1:03:19] and the ego doesn't start on milk
[1:03:22] because we've had milk for two thousand
[1:03:24] years but the eagle comes
[1:03:26] and baby eagles start on meat they don't
[1:03:29] nurse milk but they come
[1:03:31] on the fresh kill of the word they're
[1:03:32] here to get the fresh manna from heaven
[1:03:34] amen and they just get a portion at a
[1:03:36] time as they grow
[1:03:38] but they start on meat amen that's what
[1:03:40] eagles are attracted to
[1:03:42] it's a different age it's a different
[1:03:43] time we've moved into the eagle annoying
[1:03:46] thing
[1:03:46] but here brother branham starts telling
[1:03:47] this story and and we
[1:03:49] i got a quote here let's read it
[1:03:53] but now when it comes forth to eagle age
[1:03:55] that's the one that god
[1:03:56] always likens his prophets to eagles
[1:03:59] he calls himself an eagle the eagle goes
[1:04:03] so high there ain't nothing else can
[1:04:05] touch him
[1:04:06] not only is he up there but he's built
[1:04:08] for that position when he gets up there
[1:04:10] he sees where he's at some people get up
[1:04:12] there and they can't see where they're
[1:04:13] at so
[1:04:14] don't do no good to get up there
[1:04:17] so you know you've got to be
[1:04:18] predestinated for it
[1:04:20] you've got to have the eyes to see and
[1:04:22] the ears to hear
[1:04:23] you've got to have everything in order
[1:04:25] to get up there if you're not built for
[1:04:27] it
[1:04:27] you'll just blow to pieces when you get
[1:04:29] up there that's why some people can walk
[1:04:31] so long in truth and they come so far
[1:04:34] but they eventually get so high they
[1:04:36] just blow to pieces
[1:04:37] or they get so high they can't see
[1:04:38] anymore and they get all confused where
[1:04:40] they're at
[1:04:40] and they just fly back down to the
[1:04:42] ground because you've got to be
[1:04:44] built to fly that high but listen he
[1:04:47] says
[1:04:47] the brother of him says god always
[1:04:49] likens his prophets
[1:04:51] to eagles and he calls himself
[1:04:54] an eagle this is going to get really
[1:04:57] important
[1:05:00] this eagle age anointing
[1:05:05] is to get the eagles
[1:05:08] that were hatched out in the chicken
[1:05:10] yard
[1:05:13] back to their original condition
[1:05:18] that's what this fourth seal is all
[1:05:20] about it's about to get
[1:05:22] get hey you know what you were you were
[1:05:25] the seed inside of you the genetics
[1:05:27] inside of your soul
[1:05:28] is is ego it's all ego amen it's nothing
[1:05:31] but ego
[1:05:32] but yet you hatched out on the down on
[1:05:34] this earth amen
[1:05:35] and you come into a barnyard and you're
[1:05:37] with all these other birds
[1:05:39] and and you're a bird you know you're a
[1:05:40] bird you know they're a bird
[1:05:42] and you're trying to fit in and it never
[1:05:44] works out how many times does he tell
[1:05:46] the story
[1:05:46] over and over and over again and that
[1:05:48] that little eagle's a misfit to all the
[1:05:51] other little chickens and
[1:05:52] he's earthbound he was never born to be
[1:05:54] on the earth
[1:05:55] my goodness if you look at his talons he
[1:05:57] can't even walk
[1:05:59] chickens will scratch scratch i mean i
[1:06:01] mean my goodness can you imagine seeing
[1:06:03] an eagle scratch in a manure pile
[1:06:06] they just flip a whole hunk over
[1:06:09] sometimes eagles talents are so long
[1:06:11] they've got the ball
[1:06:12] up their feet in order to walk on the
[1:06:14] ground
[1:06:17] you were never built to walk on the
[1:06:19] ground
[1:06:20] you were never constructed to be
[1:06:22] comfortable in this life you were never
[1:06:24] put here to like it
[1:06:27] to fit in you were never placed here
[1:06:30] just to go with the flow and
[1:06:31] and be happy here you'll never be happy
[1:06:34] here
[1:06:34] because you're not a chicken you're an
[1:06:36] eagle you're an eagle when you were
[1:06:37] conceived you were an eagle before you
[1:06:39] were ever in the barnyard you were an
[1:06:41] eagle
[1:06:42] the eagle hatches out and he's a misfit
[1:06:44] and doesn't understand
[1:06:46] his life and doesn't know who he is or
[1:06:48] where he came from or where he's going
[1:06:50] he just assumes he's like everybody else
[1:06:52] out there until a certain day
[1:06:54] amen when mother eagle comes flying over
[1:06:56] and she lets out a scream and he looks
[1:06:59] up
[1:06:59] and he sees a creature and when he sees
[1:07:01] it he knows who he is
[1:07:05] when we saw a prophetic ministry step on
[1:07:07] the seed and do what jesus christ could
[1:07:09] only do
[1:07:10] when we saw that we knew who we were
[1:07:13] there was an awakening and saying
[1:07:14] whatever that is
[1:07:15] i am whatever whatever power whatever
[1:07:19] life
[1:07:19] is living in that prophet that's what i
[1:07:21] am down on the inside of me i'm the same
[1:07:24] thing that is
[1:07:26] and that prophetic ministry began to
[1:07:28] scream out and scream out
[1:07:30] and scream out and all of a sudden you
[1:07:31] look around and you're so not happy
[1:07:34] anymore
[1:07:36] after you've heard the message how could
[1:07:38] you be happy in the barnyard anymore
[1:07:43] how how can i get there just flap your
[1:07:46] wings
[1:07:47] you're built to fly see the fourth seal
[1:07:52] is bringing us back into our previous
[1:07:56] condition
[1:07:57] bringing us back into our predestinated
[1:08:00] place
[1:08:03] now brother brahma said these prophets
[1:08:07] were called eagles he called himself an
[1:08:10] eagle he's the great eagle brother
[1:08:11] brenham said
[1:08:13] he said we're his eaglets
[1:08:17] eaglets do they look different than the
[1:08:20] eagle or do they look the same
[1:08:24] do they act different or do they act the
[1:08:26] same
[1:08:28] are they the same fashion are they in a
[1:08:30] different fashion
[1:08:31] because we're going to find out as we go
[1:08:33] down through here that the secret to the
[1:08:36] fourth seal
[1:08:37] is incarnation
[1:08:40] god incarnate in his people
[1:08:44] the great eagle living his life through
[1:08:47] a mini-member eagle body amen
[1:08:51] this is we're not here to be a
[1:08:53] continuation of man age
[1:08:55] oh no friends we're not here to be a
[1:08:57] continuation of the mayonnaise or
[1:08:58] continuation of the laodicean church age
[1:09:01] we're here for something totally
[1:09:02] different amen we've come to an
[1:09:04] awakening of our original condition
[1:09:06] we've come to an awakening of who we
[1:09:08] really are and we're being
[1:09:09] built we're being instructed we're being
[1:09:11] told how to fly
[1:09:18] brother branham starts talking about the
[1:09:20] new birth
[1:09:21] and he says god is perfected in threes
[1:09:25] like father son holy spirit makes one
[1:09:28] god
[1:09:29] and justification sanctification baptism
[1:09:32] holy ghost
[1:09:32] makes one birth
[1:09:36] water blood and spirit makes one birth
[1:09:39] and he just brought us to the church
[1:09:41] ages amen through
[1:09:42] through uh lion ox man and then
[1:09:45] eagle but brother van is very
[1:09:48] very sure to let us know that god's not
[1:09:51] known in four he's known in three
[1:09:54] the antichrist is known and fourth but
[1:09:56] god is known in perfection in three
[1:09:59] not in four so really when we get to the
[1:10:01] eagle age
[1:10:02] this isn't a fourth age friends it's a
[1:10:05] fourth stage of revelation
[1:10:06] but really what it is it's revealing
[1:10:09] what the first three were
[1:10:11] because justification sanctification
[1:10:15] baptism of holy ghost line ox
[1:10:18] man is the new birth
[1:10:21] and the birth is not the fourth stage
[1:10:25] the three are the birth
[1:10:28] the water the blood and the spirit when
[1:10:31] the baby's coming the water the blood
[1:10:32] and the spirit
[1:10:33] you don't come to water blood and spirit
[1:10:35] and then birth
[1:10:36] the water blood and spirit is the birth
[1:10:40] is life not a fourth stage but the
[1:10:43] result of the three
[1:10:45] is life amen and the result of the three
[1:10:50] the lion knocks the man is life
[1:10:53] is god himself amen he come down
[1:10:57] a son of man revealing the son of man
[1:11:02] an eagle revealing the eagle to call out
[1:11:06] eagles amen the
[1:11:10] uneagle revealing
[1:11:13] the eagle to call out
[1:11:16] eagles he says in the
[1:11:20] in the second seal
[1:11:24] he said god works his place in a trinity
[1:11:27] justification sanctification
[1:11:29] and incarnate himself and his people
[1:11:33] with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:11:36] you got that listen again
[1:11:40] god works his place in a trinity
[1:11:44] justification sanctification
[1:11:47] and incarnate
[1:11:52] himself in his people
[1:11:55] with the baptism of the holy ghost same
[1:11:58] thing
[1:11:59] the devil's just in type after christ
[1:12:00] and satan incarnates himself
[1:12:02] when jesus incarnates himself in the
[1:12:04] people the very life that was in christ
[1:12:07] is in this person
[1:12:11] amen brother ben says in the in the
[1:12:14] third seal he said then the spirit
[1:12:16] antichrist become incarnate in a man
[1:12:17] he's talking about the devil now moving
[1:12:19] through
[1:12:20] he says we find out later on he becomes
[1:12:22] an incarnate devil too
[1:12:24] the demon goes away and the devil comes
[1:12:27] in
[1:12:28] amen in the fourth seal he says now
[1:12:30] notice he will be given a heart of a
[1:12:32] beast at that time and satan would
[1:12:34] incarnate himself because when the
[1:12:36] church goes up
[1:12:37] satan casts down sea and it's done then
[1:12:40] all of his accusing is done
[1:12:42] so we know that the the fourth seal
[1:12:45] brother branham is telling us
[1:12:46] that when the bride goes up satan
[1:12:48] himself will come down and he'll fully
[1:12:49] incarnate the beast at that time
[1:12:52] fully incarnate the pope and become the
[1:12:54] beast at that time but there's a mystery
[1:12:56] in incarnation the seal is all about
[1:12:58] incarnation and what god is doing by the
[1:13:01] opening of the seals
[1:13:02] he's coming in full measure where did
[1:13:04] the mighty angel
[1:13:06] go remember the mighty angel came down
[1:13:10] who agrees with that
[1:13:13] when the mighty angel come down where
[1:13:15] did the mighty angel
[1:13:17] go did he turn around and go back
[1:13:21] when he came down he stayed down when
[1:13:23] the mighty angel came down where did he
[1:13:25] go
[1:13:26] he went into the church
[1:13:30] god incarnate in his people
[1:13:34] that's how we'll overcome this age
[1:13:37] that's how we'll fly away in a rapture
[1:13:39] because it's god it's not a life you
[1:13:41] live it's a life he lives
[1:13:43] through you the opening of the seals
[1:13:45] brought the full word
[1:13:47] the full life the full holy ghost the
[1:13:49] holy ghost have been bound by the
[1:13:51] denominational rivers for nearly 2
[1:13:53] 000 years but to be loosed in the
[1:13:54] evening time by the evening time message
[1:13:57] back on the people again
[1:14:01] hallelujah because why the battle moved
[1:14:03] from heaven
[1:14:04] to eden and the battle come in us and
[1:14:07] now we had to have something come in us
[1:14:09] to overcome the battle
[1:14:11] because as long as he can get a subject
[1:14:13] to let down on the word of god
[1:14:14] he has won the battle over god's word
[1:14:17] but god's going to come in and ensure
[1:14:18] himself
[1:14:20] that they're not going to be defeated
[1:14:21] that satan's not going to lose
[1:14:23] because he's going to come incarnate in
[1:14:25] his people
[1:14:32] i just want to read this a couple more
[1:14:33] times so so that you really really
[1:14:35] believe it
[1:14:37] not just think it here this this idea of
[1:14:41] god incarnate of people doesn't do
[1:14:42] anything in your mind
[1:14:44] i mean it's an exciting thought we can
[1:14:45] shout and say hallelujah
[1:14:47] it's got to move from the mind to the
[1:14:49] heart
[1:14:50] it's got to be literally god doing the
[1:14:53] work inside of me not me
[1:15:04] first three stages of them that went to
[1:15:06] the dark ages
[1:15:08] so it's three stages going into the dark
[1:15:10] ages
[1:15:11] the white horse the red horse the black
[1:15:13] horse then the third
[1:15:15] the third three stages come the church
[1:15:17] out so you come into the dark ages
[1:15:19] through three
[1:15:20] through the first three church ages then
[1:15:21] you go to thyatira thyatira goes to the
[1:15:24] dark ages then you come out through
[1:15:25] three
[1:15:26] justification sanctification baptism
[1:15:28] holy ghost you know
[1:15:29] luther wesley the restoration of the
[1:15:31] bride tree
[1:15:32] so he's saying three go into the dark
[1:15:34] ages three come out
[1:15:35] justification sanctification baptism
[1:15:38] holy ghost again
[1:15:39] incarnate god made manifest among us
[1:15:42] brother brahm doesn't just say this once
[1:15:44] or he doesn't just say this twice this
[1:15:45] is the scriptures friends
[1:15:47] it's the incarnate god inside of us
[1:15:51] and the message show us the follies is
[1:15:53] don't try to go to some seminary and get
[1:15:55] some of this undocumented embalming
[1:15:57] fluid put in you of some social creed
[1:15:59] the thing you want is the baptism of the
[1:16:01] holy spirit the incarnate power of god
[1:16:04] dwelling in you
[1:16:09] my goodness we don't want
[1:16:13] we don't want anything else but god
[1:16:16] coming down
[1:16:18] we don't want anything else but to come
[1:16:21] to the eagle anointing friends
[1:16:30] brother rem says in the fifth seal
[1:16:34] he says
[1:16:38] in the bible the last age was an eagle
[1:16:41] age
[1:16:42] and god likens the eagle to his prophet
[1:16:44] see and the last days the eagle age
[1:16:46] revealer of the true word before god
[1:16:48] moves to action like he did in the days
[1:16:50] of noah
[1:16:50] he sent forth an eagle when he brought
[1:16:52] israel on pharaoh's army was ready to go
[1:16:54] he sent an eagle every time he sends an
[1:16:57] eagle at the last end of it
[1:16:59] and here he sends an eagle again that's
[1:17:01] exactly with the word
[1:17:02] so how can you make it anything else he
[1:17:04] sends an eagle
[1:17:06] why a revealer of the truth that's been
[1:17:08] fallen all through the age
[1:17:09] so how in the world the ox or the man or
[1:17:12] whatever beast was writing
[1:17:13] how could it ever be revealed until the
[1:17:15] eagles come
[1:17:16] they had their place they were godly
[1:17:18] sent beasts just the same as anybody
[1:17:20] else was
[1:17:21] the lion that was the original and when
[1:17:24] the antichrist come
[1:17:25] up in the combat then he raised up
[1:17:26] another power he sent a power to meet it
[1:17:28] then he raised up another power and he
[1:17:30] sent another power to meet it
[1:17:31] and then at last he brings down the
[1:17:33] eagle to do what
[1:17:34] to restore the children back to the
[1:17:36] original faith again of the fathers
[1:17:39] the eagle age have we come to the eagle
[1:17:42] age
[1:17:43] are we eagles hallelujah
[1:17:46] then what are eagles supposed to do
[1:17:48] whatever eagles do
[1:17:51] eagles shouldn't be acting like uh
[1:17:53] chickens eagles shouldn't be acting like
[1:17:55] buzzards eagles shouldn't be acting like
[1:17:56] hawks
[1:17:57] eagles should be acting like eagles
[1:18:01] and if we eat on the fresh kill of the
[1:18:02] word we're going to have strength to fly
[1:18:06] amen
[1:18:09] praise the lord
[1:18:12] so we find out that that these twins
[1:18:15] come down
[1:18:16] incarnate brother brenham told us now he
[1:18:18] said the time that jesus come
[1:18:21] who else came judas there's always twins
[1:18:25] but what happened to judas
[1:18:28] when it came time amen for jesus to be
[1:18:30] crucified and resurrect
[1:18:32] judas become incarnate
[1:18:35] by the devil it's incarnation
[1:18:38] we're moving all the way through the
[1:18:40] seals in jesus ministry
[1:18:42] he moves all the way through the seals
[1:18:43] he comes he's incarnate god
[1:18:45] but then judas is incarnate by the devil
[1:18:50] the devil having entered judas
[1:18:54] we find them moving down through this
[1:18:56] line but
[1:18:57] the interesting thing is peter's moving
[1:19:00] down through this line too
[1:19:02] remember we talked about peter going
[1:19:04] through the first three seals
[1:19:05] peter starts in compromise by denying
[1:19:07] the word and when jesus said the son of
[1:19:10] man must be
[1:19:10] amen must be taken and mistreated and
[1:19:13] crucified
[1:19:14] amen he says far be it from that to
[1:19:16] happen that shall never happen to you
[1:19:18] we find out he's under the white horse
[1:19:19] rider
[1:19:21] and then he takes a sword when they come
[1:19:23] to get him and cuts off the ear of the
[1:19:24] high priest he's in the red horse rider
[1:19:27] then he goes and he denies the lord
[1:19:29] three times and he's under the black
[1:19:30] horse he goes out and weeps and repents
[1:19:32] he's in the black horse and he's
[1:19:34] following the same path
[1:19:37] but something's going to change
[1:19:41] something's going to change because
[1:19:43] judas
[1:19:44] takes another step that peter can't take
[1:19:49] judas can't repent
[1:19:54] he goes and he tries to return the
[1:19:55] silver
[1:19:57] he goes back to the priest and he tries
[1:19:59] he knows that he's condemned now and he
[1:20:01] tries to repent
[1:20:02] but he doesn't go to god he goes to the
[1:20:03] lord he's just trying to cover his
[1:20:05] tracks right
[1:20:06] he's not coming to any true kind of
[1:20:07] repentance he's just trying to cover up
[1:20:09] and and they won't take it he throws it
[1:20:11] down on the floor and he goes out
[1:20:12] and he hangs himself brother bam said
[1:20:16] most people see
[1:20:17] three crosses he said but there was four
[1:20:20] judas hung himself where did judas go
[1:20:23] spiritual
[1:20:24] death peter
[1:20:28] moved all the way through the horse
[1:20:30] riders
[1:20:32] peter's a miserable human being now
[1:20:37] he's weeping he's rejected the lord
[1:20:40] amen but god is going to do something in
[1:20:42] his mercy
[1:20:44] to peter he's going to bring peter
[1:20:47] through the sixth seal
[1:20:49] he shows up in john 21 and he tells
[1:20:52] peter
[1:20:53] peter loveth thou me more than these
[1:20:57] peter's hearts crushed you think peter
[1:21:01] didn't think
[1:21:02] every day of his life about denying the
[1:21:04] lord
[1:21:05] do you think he wasn't suffering for
[1:21:07] what he had done wrong you think he
[1:21:09] wasn't
[1:21:09] embarrassed every time he saw the lord
[1:21:12] but here god in his mercy
[1:21:14] he doesn't let anything go friends he
[1:21:17] deals with it
[1:21:18] you and i we have to come to repentance
[1:21:22] god doesn't sweep things under the rug
[1:21:23] for you and i
[1:21:25] god deals with them and here he is with
[1:21:28] peter
[1:21:29] and he's dealing with peter's sin he
[1:21:32] says peter
[1:21:33] lovest thou me more than these how many
[1:21:35] times did he ask peter that
[1:21:38] three times how many times had peter
[1:21:40] denied the lord
[1:21:41] three times and after peter moves
[1:21:44] through the sixth seal and repentance
[1:21:45] amen
[1:21:46] then he goes to the upper room
[1:21:50] and in the upper room he's filled with
[1:21:52] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:21:55] and now a man who had denied the lord
[1:21:58] a man who had cut off the ear of the
[1:22:01] high priest a man who had done
[1:22:03] so many things wrong now he spills out
[1:22:06] of the upper room
[1:22:08] and what is he he's incarnate
[1:22:12] he's an eagle and he begins to stand up
[1:22:14] and preach the gospel preaches the first
[1:22:16] message
[1:22:17] preaches water baptism in jesus name
[1:22:19] preaches the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:22:21] starts laying it down so much so that
[1:22:23] now he begins a man
[1:22:25] who who was who was vile a man who was
[1:22:28] disobedient to the lord a man who had
[1:22:30] rejected what god said
[1:22:31] a man under the influence of the four
[1:22:33] horse riders now
[1:22:34] he comes out and he's walking to the
[1:22:36] gate called beautiful
[1:22:39] and now a beggar man begging for alms
[1:22:42] he fastens his eyes upon him he says
[1:22:44] look upon us he says gold and silver
[1:22:46] have
[1:22:46] i none but such as i have
[1:22:51] what did he have he had life friends
[1:22:55] he had god incarnate on the inside he
[1:22:58] was standing there as an amateur god on
[1:23:00] the earth again
[1:23:01] he was there to give back amen what he
[1:23:04] had
[1:23:04] such as i have give i unto you in the
[1:23:06] name of jesus christ
[1:23:08] take up thy bed and walk he had moved
[1:23:11] through the horse riders he had moved
[1:23:13] through all kinds of sin
[1:23:14] but when he come amen through the sixth
[1:23:16] seal and come in contact with god
[1:23:18] now what we have on the earth is an
[1:23:20] eagle
[1:23:22] see it doesn't matter what you've come
[1:23:24] through it doesn't matter what's
[1:23:26] happened in the past
[1:23:27] it doesn't matter how many times you
[1:23:29] failed the lord it doesn't matter how
[1:23:30] many mistakes you made
[1:23:32] if you can come to a true repentance if
[1:23:34] you can face down the things that you've
[1:23:36] done
[1:23:36] and you can take them one by one and
[1:23:38] face them and commit to them and confess
[1:23:40] them
[1:23:41] and come to them you can come back to
[1:23:43] that place where eagles fly
[1:23:46] paul the apostle oh my goodness do you
[1:23:49] think that he did not suffer
[1:23:50] for the crimes that he committed against
[1:23:52] the christians
[1:23:54] can you imagine if you're now
[1:23:57] fellowshipping in church
[1:23:59] with people where you had consented to
[1:24:01] the death of their loved ones
[1:24:04] you come into the church and and you're
[1:24:06] the one who arrested mom
[1:24:09] you're the one who had rested my aunt
[1:24:11] you're the one who was wreaking
[1:24:12] havoc in all the churches of god and all
[1:24:15] of a sudden he comes
[1:24:16] in contact with the pillar of fire
[1:24:19] and now now with god on the inside
[1:24:23] now he becomes something totally
[1:24:26] different than what he was
[1:24:29] now he's walking through and he does a
[1:24:31] notable miracle
[1:24:34] and the people look at him and they
[1:24:36] realize this isn't just a man
[1:24:39] and they begin to fall down his feet and
[1:24:41] worship it and say the gods have come
[1:24:43] down why
[1:24:46] because it was a son of god
[1:24:50] had become incarnate with the holy
[1:24:51] spirit
[1:24:53] and that my friends is the eagle age
[1:24:58] we're called to something more
[1:25:02] he said we're going to go back amen to
[1:25:04] whatever pentecost was
[1:25:06] we're going back to that we're called to
[1:25:08] something so much more
[1:25:10] than worrying about what we did in the
[1:25:11] past and all the mistakes that we've
[1:25:13] made in the past and
[1:25:15] every failure that we've had in the past
[1:25:17] we're here to come now to come in
[1:25:18] contact with a living god
[1:25:20] i mean we've come to the eagle age where
[1:25:22] there's been a scream that says
[1:25:23] come up higher resurrect
[1:25:27] out of the old denominationalism
[1:25:28] resurrect out of the old dead
[1:25:30] come back to life again and with the
[1:25:32] life of god inside friends
[1:25:34] everything is possible
[1:25:38] we've got we're moving into an eagle
[1:25:40] life not a chicken life
[1:25:42] an ego life with evil potentials for ego
[1:25:45] works to wear whatever god did
[1:25:47] you can do whatever jesus christ did
[1:25:51] you can do when the seals are open and
[1:25:54] redemption claims come back
[1:25:55] mother branham's standing there we
[1:25:56] talked about this last time in colorado
[1:25:59] and he's standing there and he's doing
[1:26:01] everything that adam could do before the
[1:26:03] fall
[1:26:07] was that just for him
[1:26:10] or is god going to be made manifest in a
[1:26:12] mini-membered body
[1:26:15] you can't look in the mirror and see a
[1:26:17] chicken
[1:26:20] you can't look in the mirror and see
[1:26:21] just a man
[1:26:23] but you've got to be able to look in the
[1:26:25] mirror
[1:26:27] and see an eagle you've got to be able
[1:26:30] to see
[1:26:31] a son of god with the full potentials
[1:26:35] of what god is his attributes are
[1:26:39] we've moved into eagle age
[1:26:42] it's time to act like it the secret
[1:26:46] of the fourth seal is incarnation
[1:26:49] if the devil's he's already incarnate in
[1:26:52] his church
[1:26:53] but he's going to be incarnate in one
[1:26:54] man but god came
[1:26:57] to be incarnate in his church
[1:27:00] man let's all stand musicians if you can
[1:27:03] come
[1:27:15] praise the lord you know when paul
[1:27:20] when paul was casting out spirits and
[1:27:22] opening blind eyes and
[1:27:24] healing the sick and doing all of that
[1:27:26] all that he was doing
[1:27:27] he couldn't be entertaining thoughts
[1:27:29] about remember when you did this to so
[1:27:31] and so
[1:27:32] remember stephen remember when you
[1:27:34] rejected christ remember
[1:27:36] when when you didn't go down to the
[1:27:38] meetings remember when
[1:27:40] when you stood there and you watched him
[1:27:41] stone stephen to death
[1:27:43] remember when you took papers and and
[1:27:45] you wreaked havoc among the churches he
[1:27:47] couldn't listen to any of that friends
[1:27:49] he had a new birth he had a new
[1:27:50] identification the old man was dead and
[1:27:53] he was walking in newness of life
[1:27:55] amen we've got to let the old man die
[1:27:58] we've got to let the old waves die the
[1:28:00] old habits die
[1:28:01] the old concerns die and let the old
[1:28:03] sins die
[1:28:07] brother said you're the spotless
[1:28:09] virtuous
[1:28:12] sinless
[1:28:15] let me say that again you're the
[1:28:17] spotless
[1:28:20] virtuous sinless
[1:28:26] because of the atonement you're the
[1:28:28] spotless
[1:28:30] virtuous sinless
[1:28:33] bride of jesus christ if you can come
[1:28:37] back to your original condition
[1:28:39] and you can have faith in the atonement
[1:28:42] amen there is nothing impossible
[1:28:45] unto you paul had so much confidence in
[1:28:49] the atonement
[1:28:51] that he could become an amateur god on
[1:28:56] the earth
[1:28:58] and friends this week in the last two
[1:29:01] weeks
[1:29:02] we've had fires raging in the west coast
[1:29:05] we had an 8.2 magnitude earthquake off
[1:29:07] the coast of mexico
[1:29:09] we have two hurricanes hitting the
[1:29:11] united states
[1:29:12] what is it birth pains what are birth
[1:29:16] pains

[1:31:05] this word
[1:31:08] i don't even know how to make it any
[1:31:10] more serious than i can
[1:31:11] i don't know how to plead any more than
[1:31:13] i pled i don't know how i could sit down
[1:31:15] and beg you
[1:31:16] but don't go a day without this word
[1:31:20] don't allow if social media is
[1:31:23] distracting you from the word of god
[1:31:24] throw it away
[1:31:26] if you spend an hour or two on social
[1:31:28] media and emails and and whatever
[1:31:30] instagrams and facebooks and stuff
[1:31:32] and you don't spend an hour in the word
[1:31:34] throw the social media away
[1:31:36] because it's not going to take you in a
[1:31:38] rapture it's not going to bring a
[1:31:39] manifestation of the son of god
[1:31:40] but this word is
[1:31:44] what is it that's keeping us from church
[1:31:46] what is it that's keeping us from
[1:31:47] fellowship with the saints what is it
[1:31:48] that's keeping us from reading from
[1:31:50] listening from praying
[1:31:52] whatever it is it's time to throw it
[1:31:54] away friends
[1:31:55] it's not worth it anymore we're getting
[1:31:58] to the day don't you
[1:31:59] feel him calling you don't you feel the
[1:32:02] pull of the hour
[1:32:03] then you not feel the magnet oh my
[1:32:05] goodness it it's getting
[1:32:06] stronger and stronger day by day can't
[1:32:09] you hear him
[1:32:10] calling you can't you hear the earth
[1:32:12] groaning under your feet for the
[1:32:14] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:32:16] how can we neglect this word anymore how
[1:32:19] can we let a job or a relationship or a
[1:32:21] friend
[1:32:22] or the internet or anything else keep us
[1:32:24] from what we're called to
[1:32:28] i'm going to say it again and i'm going
[1:32:31] to say it again
[1:32:32] and i'm going to say it again because
[1:32:33] something has to break the cycle
[1:32:37] this word has power in it this word has
[1:32:41] life in it this word has the life to
[1:32:43] live itself
[1:32:44] if you'll just receive it if you'll just
[1:32:48] give your life to it
[1:32:49] it's got a life in itself this message
[1:32:52] of the hour
[1:32:53] has its own life and it's the life of
[1:32:56] jesus christ
[1:32:57] and if you'll just just give up your
[1:32:59] life
[1:33:00] and take that life it'll produce what
[1:33:02] you've never been able to produce in the
[1:33:04] past
[1:33:06] well i tried that how long did you try a
[1:33:08] week two weeks
[1:33:11] it's worth your devotion it's worth your
[1:33:14] lifetime
[1:33:15] devotion well i tried and then i failed
[1:33:18] then just keep going keep trying don't
[1:33:20] stop
[1:33:22] don't stop every time the devil lays a
[1:33:24] stumbling stone in front of you don't
[1:33:25] stop every time you get a disappointment
[1:33:27] or discouragement
[1:33:28] keep with the word friend confess it
[1:33:31] believe it
[1:33:32] read it listen to it pray over it
[1:33:35] don't let anything take it from you
[1:33:39] if this is the last message that i ever
[1:33:41] preached here
[1:33:43] you've got to stick with this word
[1:33:46] amen it's the only thing that's going to
[1:33:49] see you through
[1:33:52] you're not going to make it over your 50
[1:33:54] years of merit being in the message 30
[1:33:56] years 40 years 50
[1:33:58] you're not going to make it based off a
[1:34:00] merit badge or a credit system you won't
[1:34:02] make it based off that
[1:34:04] you're gonna i'm not gonna make it based
[1:34:06] off who your parents are or where you go
[1:34:07] to church or
[1:34:08] who you're related to you're never gonna
[1:34:10] make it that way
[1:34:12] you're not gonna make it on your moral
[1:34:13] character
[1:34:15] you're not gonna make it on your ability
[1:34:17] to live right
[1:34:18] you're going to make it because the word
[1:34:20] the life of the word has lived his life
[1:34:23] through you
[1:34:27] what breaks my heart is i'll say it and
[1:34:29] i'll scream it
[1:34:30] and i'll say it and somebody will go off
[1:34:32] tomorrow and play games and watch a
[1:34:34] movie and play
[1:34:36] it breaks my heart it kills me
[1:34:40] that i'll pour myself out and brother
[1:34:42] man poured his life out and the message
[1:34:44] has been poured out and we'll play games
[1:34:46] with it
[1:34:47] that we'll have it and not devote
[1:34:49] ourselves to it that will not
[1:34:51] we will play we'll play all kinds of
[1:34:53] sports things and get all kinds of
[1:34:55] leagues

[1:41:57] you know old johnny crow remember the
[1:41:59] story of old johnny crow
[1:42:03] those old johnny crow got tied down by a
[1:42:05] farmer and
[1:42:06] he would leap and try to fly and leap
[1:42:08] and try to fly
[1:42:10] and he couldn't get there because his
[1:42:11] leg was tied down to the ground
[1:42:13] somebody felt sorry for him and come
[1:42:15] along and they they sniped the rope so
[1:42:17] that he could fly
[1:42:18] but he got so used to being tied to the
[1:42:21] ground
[1:42:21] he didn't realize that he was free and
[1:42:23] could could fly anytime he wanted
[1:42:26] and friends god has come and clipped
[1:42:28] your string
[1:42:30] and you can fly any time you want
[1:42:32] [Music]
[1:42:34] don't get so used to being earthbound to
[1:42:36] forget the fact that you're an eagle and
[1:42:38] you were called to fly
[1:42:40] you can perform the supernatural now
[1:42:43] amen you can perform in the supernatural
[1:42:46] realms
[1:42:46] now you can climb higher in the heights
[1:42:48] of god now
[1:42:50] you can have a prayer life now you can
[1:42:53] have revelation on the word
[1:42:54] right now your string has been clipped
[1:42:56] johnny
[1:42:58] and by the way you're not a crow you're
[1:43:00] an eagle
[1:43:03] some of us have stumbled around in the
[1:43:05] chicken yard so long
[1:43:07] we don't realize that we're free
[1:43:10] that we fly we've been called to fly
[1:43:12] mother eagle's still screaming come
[1:43:14] up here and soar in the heavenlies
[1:43:19] oh how i love you how i
[1:43:24] i wish i could take it and just shove it
[1:43:27] right in
[1:43:28] i would do it for every one of you but i
[1:43:31] believe god's calling
[1:43:33] and i believe there's a people here
[1:43:35] that's responding
[1:43:37] saying i'm gonna fly just
[1:43:40] get out of your comfort zone get out of
[1:43:43] the familiar
[1:43:44] lay it aside stretch those spiritual
[1:43:46] wings and start flying in the heavenlies
[1:43:49] you know they found that eagles spend so
[1:43:51] much time flying
[1:43:53] and it's not hunting for food they did a
[1:43:56] research and found out they spent so
[1:43:58] many hours in the air
[1:43:59] only a certain percentage that was food
[1:44:02] and the researchers can only come up
[1:44:03] with one
[1:44:04] conclusion the only conclusion they
[1:44:07] could come up with for the why they
[1:44:08] spent so much time in the air
[1:44:10] is the fact that eagles enjoy flying
[1:44:14] [Music]
[1:44:15] we just enjoy flying who enjoys flying
[1:44:19] oh praise god let's bow our heads dear
[1:44:22] heavenly father we thank you lord for

[1:47:31] my christian life come to the message
[1:47:33] and i would pray i pray every day you
[1:47:35] know because a christian prays every day
[1:47:37] sometimes just getting out your bible
[1:47:39] and reading and getting on your knees to
[1:47:40] pray
[1:47:41] is nothing more than showing your
[1:47:42] respect and reverence to god
[1:47:46] it's something we ought to do but one
[1:47:48] thing i learned in all that is you
[1:47:50] cannot manufacture a prayer life
[1:47:53] i've tried i would pray and i would
[1:47:56] set aside time and i would pray and you
[1:47:59] know
[1:47:59] 15 minutes into prayer i'm just
[1:48:01] repeating the cycle again and i'm
[1:48:04] struggling to pray and falling asleep
[1:48:07] and
[1:48:07] i won't ask you to raise your hands if
[1:48:08] you've been there because you all been
[1:48:09] there
[1:48:10] [Music]
[1:48:12] and wanting to have a prayer life but
[1:48:14] not able to produce a prayer life but
[1:48:15] still praying every day because that's
[1:48:17] my respect to god that's my honor to him
[1:48:20] is to bow before him every day but
[1:48:23] something happened about a year ago for
[1:48:25] me
[1:48:26] all of a sudden all i can do is describe
[1:48:29] is he started pulling me into prayer
[1:48:33] wasn't anything that was manufactured it
[1:48:35] wasn't anything that was made up
[1:48:37] it's just a tug in my heart to pray and
[1:48:40] it was almost like he was wooing me into
[1:48:42] communion with him
[1:48:44] you know sometimes you would just like
[1:48:46] your spouse just to come and sit with
[1:48:47] you for a while just
[1:48:49] just you try to get him just to come and
[1:48:50] sit down and just talk with you for a
[1:48:52] while
[1:48:52] that's what it felt like he just he just
[1:48:55] wanted me
[1:48:57] he just wanted me to come and talk to
[1:48:59] him and i felt that pull
[1:49:02] and all i did you know for a few days i
[1:49:05] just
[1:49:05] felt the pull i didn't do anything about
[1:49:08] it
[1:49:09] why are we so thick-headed i don't ever
[1:49:11] know
[1:49:12] why god deals with human beings i don't
[1:49:14] know but
[1:49:15] we're thick school week went by and i
[1:49:18] keep thinking yeah i'm going to pray i
[1:49:19] i feel him pulling me but finally there
[1:49:22] was a day
[1:49:23] that i set my alarm an hour early
[1:49:25] [Music]
[1:49:27] and i got up and i entered into prayer
[1:49:31] and i had the sweetest time of prayer
[1:49:33] that i've ever had
[1:49:35] and for a year now lord's been getting
[1:49:38] me up
[1:49:39] early i've been praying one hour
[1:49:42] two hour every day and i don't say that
[1:49:46] for any other reason and tell you
[1:49:48] he called for it all i did was respond
[1:49:53] has he been calling you into prayer
[1:49:56] have have you been busy putting it off
[1:49:58] for another time or
[1:50:00] maybe after i get this done or tomorrow
[1:50:03] telling your friends all you've got to
[1:50:05] do is step into it and it happens
[1:50:08] it's him that's calling is he calling
[1:50:11] you into a closer walk
[1:50:13] is he calling you to higher heights can
[1:50:15] you feel him calling you
[1:50:17] all you've got to do is step into it
[1:50:19] just lay down
[1:50:20] it's not anything you can manufacture
[1:50:22] you can't manufacture a closer walk you
[1:50:24] can't manufacture an overcoming life
[1:50:26] you can't manufacture a prayer life you
[1:50:28] can't manufacture a faith walk
[1:50:31] it's not something you do it's something
[1:50:33] he calls you to
[1:50:34] but you've got to be willing to lay
[1:50:36] something down and step into it
[1:50:39] [Music]
[1:50:41] it's been the most wonderful experience
[1:50:42] of my life
[1:50:44] when i say god i want more i'm not
[1:50:46] satisfied i want more
[1:50:48] he's calling for more do you feel him
[1:50:51] calling you
[1:50:52] has he been calling to you for more has
[1:50:56] he been asking you to come and sit with
[1:50:57] him and talk with him
[1:51:00] i'd encourage you step into it he'll
[1:51:03] make it happen
[1:51:04] you won't have to manufacture a thing
[1:51:07] there's nothing that's made up in the
[1:51:08] christian life
[1:51:10] i don't think when paul and silas were
[1:51:12] singing and praising the lord when they
[1:51:14] were in
[1:51:14] prison chains i don't think that was
[1:51:16] manufactured praise
[1:51:18] i think it was genuine and everything in
[1:51:20] the kingdom of god is genuine friends
[1:51:23] but he's calling for it and i want to
[1:51:26] step into it
[1:51:28] how many wants to step into it just lay
[1:51:31] it down
[1:51:32] and just move forward he'll do it you
[1:51:35] don't have to do a thing
[1:51:37] praise god you can be dismissed as we
