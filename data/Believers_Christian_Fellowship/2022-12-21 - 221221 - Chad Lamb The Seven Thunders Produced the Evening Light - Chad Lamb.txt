I mean let's read Revelation chapter 8 verse 1 together and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour let's go over to Revelation chapter 10 then I want to always note and always put in the top of our mind and when brother Branham ties Revelation chapter 8 1 which is the opening of the seventh seal he always ties it together with Revelations 10 1-7 so these things go together they're the same portion of scripture Revelations 10 1-7 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and brother Branham tells us in the seals he said this is Christ the messenger to the church the angel of the Covenant so we know who this is now coming down in Revelations 10. and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the son and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and he cried with a loud voice is when a lion roarth when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created the Heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets amen God bless you as you take your seeds amen if you remember we opened with this passage of scripture last Wednesday so I'm going to be in the same vein of thought I couldn't really break free from it so I just have to continue on and for a subject for a title tonight I'd like to preach on the seven Thunders produced the evening light so the seven and Thunders produce the evening light and like I said last Wednesday last Wednesday was a a lot of review and uh I enjoyed the review amen I always feel bad when it strikes my heart to go over something that we've gone over so many times but I can't help it this is my life this is our life this is where we're at in time and this is who we are these are our scriptures amen and so I just want to go through this again where Revelation chapter 8 1 is the seventh seal and there was silence nothing was said not even a symbol was getting given brother Benham said it was a total mystery with God he didn't even give a symbol what it was showing that there was nothing spoken here there was nothing to give it away it was a complete secret and we know that the great secret amen of the Bible is the coming of the Lord no one knows the the day nor hour nobody knows when he would come God has this all to himself and the same thing's true with the seventh seal they're tied together in the seventh Sea on the coming of the Lord but brother Branham tied this scripture Revelation chapter 8 1 to Revelations 10 1 and the mighty Angel which he said was Christ coming down with an open book in its hand that means that at this point the book is no longer sealed what was sealed in Revelation chapter 5 the lamb has stepped forward to take the book amen and he has loosed to seals and he's come down with an open book in his hand praise God Amen and so remember the Book of Revelation is a book of symbols amen what gets confusing when we get into the Book of Revelations is we try to make it fit a timeline and we try to make it we try to Define everything in physical understanding amen but these are spiritual happenings these are symbols that are given to us to understand something amen so we're we're not in in looking for the coming of Revelations 10 1-7 to be fulfilled we are not looking to see a giant figure coming down from heaven this is this is the mighty Angel this is a spiritual happening right and the book that's open in his hand is the Revelation amen that was sealed before is now open and he's bringing it down amen so it's coming from what was in the back part of God's mind is now coming to be revealed on Earth praise God and so he he cried with a loud voice is when a lion roars and when he did seven Thunders uttered their voices and the Thunder is always the voice of God the Thunder was speaking something something intelligible was spoken something that was understandable was spoken because John was described through the Revelation amen and John picked up his pen to write what he heard the seven Thunders uttered so it meant John understood what it was and could write it down amen but he was told to seal it up amen and this is what brother Brown talks about the seals on the back side of the book amen for years he talks about this as the seals on the back of the book amen he said nothing was wrote about these and he says the seals on the inside and the seals on the outside and it looks as he's talking about two sets of seals and what he's referring to is the Seven Seals that's in Revelation chapter six amen the sixth seals there and then the seventh we find in Revelation chapter eight they were opened in symbol form amen when it opened we saw a white horse in a red horse and a black horse and a Pale Horse and all of these symbols amen but but that was Seven Seals and he calls that the seals on the inside of the book then when he gets here he said in that back part them other seals he has all ways of mentioning this but what he's showing is something was uttered here something was spoke and it was sealed amen and it was seven Thunders that was sealed so we realized brother bam says also he says that there's things that's not he goes he says it's not even written in the Bible at all but then after he comes to it in the Seven Seals he says no that can't be true because Jesus says no man can add to or take away he said it's got to be a revelation that was already in the book but hidden so it's not another Seven Seals amen it was the seven Thunders that were sealed and what did the Thunder say Amen it'll be revealed when this Mighty Angel comes down praise God in the church AIDS book brother Branham says in the later Sean Church age and I love this sentence and I want you to hear exactly the way brother Ben says it it says it was in the end time period that the seven thunders of Jesus came forth now catch that he didn't say the seven Thunders he said it was in the end time period that the seven thunders of Jesus came forth amen so these are the seven thunders of Jesus so who has to bring the Thunders Jesus amen whose Thunders are they they're Jesus's Thunders it's going to take Christ the lamb to bring the Thunders it's going to take the mighty Angel which is Christ these are the seven thunders of Jesus not of William Branham these are the seven thunders of Jesus amen and then he quotes Revelation 10 3-4 and he said he cried with the loud voices when a lion roared and when he had cried seven Thunders under their voices when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things with the seven Thunders uttered and write them not what was in those Thunders no one knows but we need to know it's so important we need to know and it will take a prophet to get the Revelation because God has no other way of bringing out his scriptural Revelations except by a prophet so that means if the if the prophet has come amen then the Thunders have been revealed because there's no other option amen praise be to God so in the third seal and I know this is familiar to us but I I'm going to say it anyways amen so you might as well say Amen anyways some of this is going to be familiar but as as we go through familiar territory it always becomes richer more uh deeper it becomes clearer at least for me and in the third seal the prophet of God so now that's what's the reason today the revivals that we're supposed to have we've we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stirring I'm going to read two quotes that I read last Wednesday amen and and we're going to go from there springboard off of that but this is the same thing we talked about we haven't had a real stirring no no no no no no no sir don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they've got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowhere no no the bride hasn't had a Revival yet there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it so so Brothers telling us there's been no Revival for the bride there's been church revivals but no Revival to stir the bride amen there's been but it'll take the seven unknown Thunders to he says back there he's talking about at the back part of the book Revelation 10 to wake her up again amen so she's sleeping and needs to be awakened and what will awaken her it'll be the seven Thunders then he goes this is that was in the third seal in March of 1963 so in the third seal he's saying there's not been a stirring there's been no the bride hasn't had a Revival it's going to take the seven Thunders to wake her up but then he comes in 1964 in July of 64 and recognizing your day and its message he said one of the finest papers on the field Harold of his coming but they hardly will print anything unless it's about fast pray fast pray sound a trumpet how many reads it you know you see it all the time fast pray it's all you hear fast pray we're going to have a great breaking of the day there's a great thing going to happen all of you pray pray word not too late yet why do they do that why do they do that they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing that there will be an Awakening they're good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride so he said it'll take those seven Thunders those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up then he says they're crying for an Awakening but they haven't recognized amen The Awakening of the Bride so somewhere in that year and four months something happened that will awaken the bride it was The Awakening of the bride and he said it'll take the seven unknown Thunders so the F7 unknown Thunders have to be revealed somewhere in that period of time for The Awakening of the Bride but being Christians they feel the pool of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen but see they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you and I'd like to say that's still possible to be true today looking for something to happen some stirring some great thing to happen the thing that needs to happen for the bride has happened amen it's awakened the bride she's awake amen and what woke her up is those seven unknown Thunders when they were revealed amen it came to awaken the bride it is the bride's Revival amen it is disturbing for the bride amen so we're not looking for a Revival to come to stir the bride we've had the Revival to stir the bride and to awaken the bride so when we're when somebody's pointing to the Future to the Future to the Future and what what we don't need what comes in the future what we've already received is what is taking us further on Amen this is the thing this is the Awakening of the Bride amen and what are we waiting for not for a stirring we receive the stirring we're waiting for the last seed to get secure in their position amen we're not waiting for a stirring we're waiting for the last one to get locked in it's important to know because if not we're still looking for something looking for something and not taking value in what we've already received amen and not realizing what we need is here what we need is come amen I'm not wanting something to come amen if I keep looking for something to come then what happens when I keep pointing to the Future and not recognizing what's come then I stay in a weakened condition because I don't value what takes me amen through the body change I'm looking for something to happen to take me in the body change when what's come is enough [Music] that's the danger of pointing to Future Revival future stirring future Awakening future happening it's it's dangerous because what it does is take the very power and the Very anointing and the Very Awakening amen that's going to carry the bride all the way through it takes it and diminishes it in the minds of the people looking for something else but we need to go back and find out what's been done what was it that happened between March of 63 and July of 64. what is that because that's the thing that I need pray for me to God let's go to Matthew 25 together now remember last Wednesday we talked about the three pools in Matthew 25 Matthew 25 and verse 1. and we talked about the third pool was was the one that catches the rainbow trout the Covenant fish the first two were used to get the attention of the of the rainbow trout but it was the third one that hooked him and caught them amen and so we and we saw that the third pool was the opening of the word and so now we're right in the same vein of thought but let's look here at Matthew 25 verse 1. then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened to the ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept so they all slept so there must come an Awakening amen there must come an Awakening of the brine they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answer is saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not. amen so so we know this Parable the wise and the foolish virgin brother bam talks about it a lot but what I want to show is that they were all asleep but there was an Awakening there was a Midnight Cry that came and we know the Midnight Cry amen came through the prophet of the age and and it said behold he cometh go out to meet him amen so we find out there's several things going on here that I want to point out one is where they were was in the city amen but when the Midnight Cry come he said behold the bridegroom cometh go out to meet him amen not he's coming all the way into the denominational systems but he's coming you go out of the system and meet him all right amen and that's the hour that we live in when we're leaving the system because the midnight Christ says behold he cometh go out and meet him amen so there's a meeting in between between the marriage supper amen and the coming out of the denominations we meet him and Unite with him and we're walking with him into the marriage supper amen and this is what the prophet of God says in the message proving his word is now we say he's raised from the dead I didn't say it the word here said it they said he raised from the dead he says he's the same yesterday today and forever you believe that he promised these things to happen in the last day that the same son of man will be made manifest now remember that was not Jesus talking to Abraham there that could discern the thoughts and Sarah's mind behind him that was not Jesus he had not yet been born but it was a man in human flesh that Abraham called Elohim the great Almighty and Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom now watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed so the coming of the son of man is the same as the revealing of the son of man and the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church see not no more the bride is called see in the day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride the bridegroom call will come right through this so where will the bridegroom call come from from the revealing of the son of man which is Luke 17 30 which is part of the ministry of brother Branham so the revealing of the son of man is the coming of the son of man and the bridegroom call come it comes through this says he cometh go out to meet him go beyond the camp to him he's cometh go to him amen because he's not coming into the churches he stopped dealing with the churches now he's calling for his bride to come stand by his side he's calling us out of the systems to unite with him so the bridegroom call will come right through this so so I want to read this again in the day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride so it's actually a marriage that's taking place not will take place is taking place the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergy man I don't know do you see what I mean it's the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church in him as one the bride and then shall go home to the wedding supper amen she's already United see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage right so now there's a through the revealing of the son of man amen which is Jesus Christ coming and revealing himself through that prophetic office amen that that is will do what unite the church and the head together amen what it'll do it'll bring the marriage together it's the bridegroom call saying come out from among her keys come now go to him and then there's a spiritual union an invisible Union of the Bride amen in Christ and then he's taking her into the marriage supper so where are we now we're United with Christ on our journey to the marriage supper what are we waiting for we're waiting for the last one to unite with Christ the last one to come out and be United amen so where am I I'm not there and I'm not yet there I'm in between praise God now so the bridegroom call is the Midnight Cry it's the Awakening of the Bride it's the cry that wakes her up and tells her he's come the bridegroom cometh go out to meet him and then they unite and he takes her into the marriage feast now in the seventh seal brother REM says now do you notice on the opening of the seventh seal it's also in a threefold mystery this one I have will speak and have spoke that it's the mystery of the seven Thunders now listen he's saying those the opening of the seventh seal is in a threefold mystery and I'm going to speak or half spoke that on one of them it's the mystery of the seven thunder so the mystery of the seven Thunders and the opening of the seventh seal go together the seven thunders in heaven will unfold this mystery the seven thunders in heaven will unfold this mystery it'll be right at the coming of Christ because Christ said no one knew when he would return did you notice when the Jews asked him that you know when we compared the scriptures here with Matthew 24 with the six seals the seventh was left out because you see Christ said only God himself no not even the angels no wonder it wasn't even written you see they hushed nothing taking place Angels don't know it nobody knows when he's coming but they'll be there'll be seven voices of these seven Thunders that will reveal the great Revelation at that time what is it his coming what will reveal it the seven voices of the seven Thunders so do we wait for those no because it'll take a prophet amen and the prophets already come so it's already been done she's already been awakened she's already been called through the midnight call to go out and join with him and be United with him by what by the voice of the seven Thunders what is that the seventh seal the coming of the Lord amen it's all tied together praise God brother Franco if you could bring up the Whiteboard I'm going to write on that for just a second so he says the angels I want to read this again so we can catch the context he said Christ said only God himself known not even the angels no wonder it wasn't even written what was it written the seventh seal Revelations 8 1 silence in heaven there's not even a symbol amen then you go to the seven Thunders they uttered John was going to write he said seal it up those are the two things that are not even written they're the same thing not even written Angels don't know it God themselves the only one who knowed it amen no wonder it wasn't even written you see they hush nothing taken place then Angels don't know it nobody knows when he's coming but there'll be seven voices of the seven Thunders that will reveal the great Revelation at that time oh praise God it's so simple it goes over the heads of Millions but there's a simple little bride remember when we said when we when we talked last time we preached on brother Branham opening a god hiding himself in Simplicity revealing himself in the same he started with the scripture who hath believed our report and who has seen the arm of the Lord revealed and brother random answers that those who believe the report have seen the arm of the Lord revealed the very power of God is coming this day how has it come it's come if you believe that prophets report amen if you believe what he's telling you it's the revelation of the arm of the Lord that's been extended to the bride it is the power it is the quickening power it is the line it is what we need to finish the journey amen so I'll read that again there'll be seven voices of these seven Thunders that will reveal the great Revelation at that time so I believe if we don't know it if we it won't be no till that time but it will be revealed in that day in the hour that it's supposed to be revealed in that's very cryptic so when will it be revealed in the hour that it's supposed to be revealed but when is that it'll be revealed in that day and the hour that it's supposed to be revealed in and and the reason it's cryptic and we'll get to that in a minute the reason it's cryptic is because it it was open in 1963. but it's still being revealed as individuals come to the revelation of the seven Thunders so it's being revealed in the hour that it's supposed to be revealed in for me it was a different hour than you for some of you it was several many years ago for some of us it was more recently but it's being revealed in the hour that it's supposed to be revealed in don't worry it's not going to Mrs Mark amen and you say is it revealed well it still might not be revealed to the last seed but it'll be revealed in the hour supposed to be revealed and to them amen remember we're not talking church anymore we're talking individuals he's coming to individuals to reveal himself to a bride and they're going to catch the bride call as an individual I wasn't even alive when the bride call was being made amen and when it was open amen but I heard the bride call many years later but it was fresh for me and that was the hour it was supposed to be revealed to me so brother Brown says things sometimes very cryptic but it matches exactly perfectly where we're at amen if if we make everything uh uh started and completed in 1963 then all of us born after that have no chance amen praise be to God amen so I'm going to write down something here so the let's just write this seven Thunders equals seventh seal we got another equal sign but I'll read a quote and we'll do something else now in the church age book the latest in church age says now this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10 7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers so the messenger Malachi 4 in Revelation 10 7 is brother William Branham and he will reveal the mysteries of the seven Thunders so are the mysteries of the Thunders revealed absolutely that's the bridegroom call amen that that that is the Awakening of the Bride that that is the revelation of his coming it's all revealed under that okay now questions and answers uh from 1964 August of 1964 questions and answers there's a question comes in that says have the seven Thunders which equal seven Mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the Seven Seals but are yet but are yet not known to us as the Thunders yet he said no they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about what the the revelation of Zeus when he preached the seals that's what the Thunders was about they was the seven Thunders that had uttered their voices and no one could make out what it was John knew what it was but he was forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is the messenger of the seventh Church age Amen brother random makes it so clear you cannot miss it amen the seven Thunders were revealed what was the preaching of the seals that's what it was all about that's what the Thunders was about the Revelation in the seals and that's tied to the seventh seal now this is what he says next in the seventh seal did you notice when the Jews asked him you know when we compare the scriptures here with Matthew 24 with the six seals the seventh seal was left out because you see Christ said only God himself no not even the angels no wonder it wasn't even written you see they hush nothing taken place the Angels don't know nobody knows when he's coming we read this earlier we're reading again nobody knows when he's coming there'll be seven voices of those Thunders that will reveal the great Revelation at that time so the seventh seal and the Seven Thunders go together now let's keep reading same quote so I believe if we don't know it it won't be no till that time but it will be revealed in that day in the hour that it's supposed to be revealed in that's as far as we read the quote before but now we're going further so the thing for us to do is to be reverent before God and serve him and do all that we know how to do and live good Christian lives here now we find that the Sixth Seal has been open to us we see it and we know that the seventh seal cannot be broke to the public until the hour arrives now there was some reason that God let those seven voices be thundered because it must come for we find now listen to where he's going to tie this together we find that Christ the lamb took the book in his hand and he opened the seventh seal was he talking about the seven Thunders now he's talking about Christ opening the seventh seal amen but you see it's a hidden mystery no one knows it but it's right along with what he said no one would know is coming they also would not know about the seventh under mystery so you see it's connected together so what's connected together the revelation of the seven Thunders which are the Mysteries contained the revelations and the Seven Seals is connected with the seventh seal which is his coming die amen and listen he didn't come with only six open seals that little book was open him coming is the seventh seal amen and he's the one who revealed the six seals so now in 1965 and July of 1965 and the message anointed ones at the end time says notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but he when he begins to declare his message the first pull healing second pull prophesying third pulled the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed no more there is no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can then be Vindicated is by the word and remember now this is what I want to hone in on the third pull was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word so the seven Thunders equals the seventh seal equals the third pool and that's a simplistic way to write it we know there's a lot of details we can go into a lot of things there's a lot more information there but these things are all linked together and the whole point was for us to realize to see and the whole reason I want to go through this again is see that we're not deferring to some future event amen what's what's needed to happen has happened but what's happening is it's becoming a reality to each member of the body one by one amen it's being revealed in the hour that it must be revealed and may it be revealed to you in this hour may it be tonight if it hasn't struck home yet May a strike home tonight amen because this is the Revelation that the bride needs to be awake amen and be active and be be moving out of the denomination you say brother Chad I'm not in the denomination amen if you've not caught this Revelation we're still stuck in Old traditional thinking in our own thinking but he's come to break us out of that and call us out of that to unite with him the word no more partial but full reality amen no more our own ideas but the Revelation that he brought in this hour amen so that he can Unite with us so that he can live his life through us amen so there's a tremendous power in this Revelation the reason that I want to go over it again and again and again is not it's not because it's interesting facts it's not because it's it's interesting to teach and to know and for intellectual reasons it's because it has the very power to break us free it is the very arm of God that's extended to us it's the very thing that makes us recognize I don't have to wait I don't have to defer I don't need something else what I need is here what I need is come I have United with the word and it is the power of God to bring every manifestation that must be made in this hour I don't need to wait for something else I have what I need what I need has come I have United with the person of the word and nothing is impossible now nothing is impossible we don't catch this Revelation we're hoping for something else something new something more to bring me no what I need is for this to become more of a reality to me I need to become more part of my life part of my thinking part of my reaction I needed to move from here to here I need to be more than understanding I needed to be my very life blood that I know who I am where I am what I'm doing on this Earth whose I am and who is living in me no we're not biting time for the next event this is the event this is the event Christ uniting with his bride him coming in the formation of his bride the very life of Jesus Christ all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he's born into his church so the fullness of the godhead is to be bin bodied bodied on this Earth in a mini-membered bride and that bride is being woke up by the bridegroom call of the seven thunders of the third pool of the seventh seal however you want to word it but it's this Revelation that's been locked amen that God is unlocked in this day so that she will recognize I'm not a church member amen I'm not part of a system I am one individual that God has called I am a part of God I am a part of Christ and Christ is living in me then when we get into trouble now we're not looking for something else to help us out of trouble when I need to help and help me out of trouble has already United with me when I heard the bridegroom call and left everything else and ran out to unite with him in the marriage then then the one I have need of is in me now I'm not crying out to bring him down he's in me praise be to God oh praise God there's something so powerful and the believer's quiet confidence in who they are not somebody who Frets and runs all over the place every time there's trouble but somebody who says you know what I know I know who I am I know the hour I live in I know where the manifestation is I I know where the word is and I can hold steady and let the word that I'm married to perform a miracle in my life let's go to Zechariah 14. what's amazing to me that it's so simple when the Revelation really strikes and we see it can seem complicated because there's lots of terms and there's so many ways we could describe it and there's so many things that go with this it's the whole Bible it's the whole message there's so many ways we can talk about the same thing in so many terms we can use for the same thing the same event but for me it's really so very very simple that you look at and say well that can't be it but that's it you know the coming of the Lord when Jesus Christ came to Earth it was so simple it was a baby a man who was birthed from a mother and and a stable laying there and in a manger and poor Shepherds poor literate Shepherds amen we're told by angels that it was there and they're the ones running through the town poor illiterate Shepherds not priests not not not not not individuals who were respected not those who had a good reputation or those that would be trustworthy or people would listen to but poor literate Shepherds were running through Bethlehem and saying guess what happened Angels talked to us and told us that Messiah is in that stable over there go past the cow move around the sheep look beyond the donkey and down in there that's the Messiah that's Christ the lord that's the Fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy it's all right there and it's so simple it's so it's it's an actual baby laying down wrapped in swaddling cloth the the the cloth off a yoke of oxen and laying there in a teenage mother holding it and you look at that and say that can't be what Isaiah was talking about but that's exactly what Isaiah was talking about and in this day you'd be like no no no amen that that that man from Kentucky with a seventh grade education amen every day meeting an angel in a room amen that's giving him the revelation of the Seven Seals that can't indicate the coming of the Lord but it is the indication of the coming of the lord it's the very thing that shows he's here that he's come that the mighty Angel has come down to take dominion over the Beast of the sea and over the Beast of the land and he's taking dominion over everything where is he at he's coming in people he was there in that Prophet that day amen he was there giving out the revelation of the Seven Seals it wasn't he it was a son of man revealing the son of man it was Christ Jesus he had already broken the seals and was opening the seals it wasn't that man it was Christ in the man and it was so simple you said that can't be the coming of the Lord but it is the coming of the Lord amen and who does he get the talent illiterate unrespected unknown uneducated they're the ones who believe the message of the angel and say that's exactly what's taking place what it was prophesied what was talked about what they've looked for for thousands of years was in that stable well we've looked for thousands of years has come amen where is it it's in me how do you know I heard the bridegroom call something woke me up stirred me into action caused me to leave everything that I thought was right I abandoned and I ran out to unite with him and now I'm walking with him to the married sub that can't be it brother Chad I don't know maybe we're still waiting for the hour that it'll be revealed to you because it'll be revealed in the hour it's supposed to be revealed [Music] Zechariah 14 and 6. and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it should be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light brother Branham refers to the scripture over and over and he talks about our day and in the evening time at the setting of the Sun at the finishing of time at the end of the church dispensations it shall be light and and remember I the title is the seven Thunders produced the evening light and questions and answers in 1961 brother Graham says you take the creatures that roam at night roaches and beetles and bugs and things let the sun rise or let a light flash on watch how they take for Darkness that's the way the gospel is when it flashes on what happens to those who wants to call you Holy Roller what happens to those people who make fun of you when the light flashes on they shoot for Darkness as hard as they can go because they're the children of the ninth but the children of the day walk in the light let's go to first Thessalonians together first Thessalonians chapter five I want to read two scriptures here back to back first Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse 1. first Thessalonians 5-1 but of the times in the seasons Brethren you you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord is so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape but G Brethren are not in darkness this whole world is in darkness and they're going to enter and travail they're entering and now frankly but you're not in darkness that the day should overtake you as a thief you are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of the darkness so there are two type of children they're Children of the day and Children of the light and Children of the Night and Children of the darkness Children of the darkness flourish and lack of light Children of the day flourish in the light makes sense brother bear says in in the message Christ is revealed in his own word said the blindness of a bat you could turn on a light and the bat would be so blind he couldn't fly a hoot owl all those night Prowlers and things like that roaches and things can't see in the daytime they don't know what it's all about they can't see and the evening lights has come on every Parable everywhere we go to Nature to the Bible the statues the uh that Daniel saw the king of that day all of them saw and all these things everybody every form every move every place in the body positionally shows us the very hour that we're living in not another move can come above it there was a move of the hand charity Wesley there was a move of foundation Luther charity there never was a greater it was called the Wesleyan move they sent missionaries to all the world one of the greatest moves that was made in the age before that then came the Pentecostal age then came in the different fingers and things the Pentecostal age of tongues and nose and so forth now it's in the eyes which is prophetic what good will you need eyes or need light if the eye wasn't there to see there has to be eyes first so you have to have a prophet on the scene first before you can turn on the light simple and then when that comes he opened the Seven Seals and revealed the evening light when what comes when the prophet is here then he opened the Seven Seals and revealed the evening light take all the Mysteries that's been hid down through these Church ages now revealed them as he promised to do in Revelations 10 1-7 here we are today sitting in the midst of the word and the word being revealed to us by Jesus Christ who's revealing the word Jesus Christ amen so we see when the eyes showed up when the prophet was here he opened the seals and revealed the evening light so the the the the the uh revealing of the seven Thunders brought the evening light but the light only is good for a child of the day a creature of the night can't see a creature of the night is Blinded by the Light just like a child of the day can't see at night a child of the night can't see in the day so the light is actually blinding remember the Apostle Paul he was Saul before he was born he was Saul and and he thought he was walking in the light he thought he could see come up under the school of Gamaliel he had a great education he knew the Scrolls he knew the scriptures he needed the prophets he knew it all but when he met the pillar of fire that light of that day blinded him amen God had to let him know you can't see amen with that understanding you can't see and God actually had to open his eyes amen through the body in that day because when when that Pillar of Fire spoke to him he said Paul Saul Saul why persecute us now me he said who are you Lord he said I'm crying Jesus whom you persecuted and he wasn't touching Jesus The Man from Nazareth he was touching his body which was the church and so the the light of the day smoking blind amen so God could show him that you can't see you think you see but you can't see then he used the very Body of Christ to open his eyes so the The Children of the Night cannot see the light they're blind to it so the light can be shining bright but they can't see it we can't make them see it you have to be made able to see it by God you have to be the right kind of child to see it you can't make somebody see it the light that's shining will blind those who are not predestinated to see it and the message the power of God he said Here Comes the Army here comes the Army and the dust of roaring and when Moses Stood Still to see the salvation of God the great Pillar of Fire that was hanging before them had led them into this trap moved went over and stood between Israel and Pharaoh's Army and they had rejected the light and any man who rejects the light receives the same thing they did it became midnight Blackness to them the same light that made a light for the children of Israel to walk by blinded the eyes of pharaoh in his army this same Revelation that lets us know the day we live in is the very same Revelation that blinds the eyes of others in the crisis the mystery of God revealed he says notice the anointed man Christ himself here oh God has made known look but he has the preeminence as God fully manifested in Jesus Christ God's Great secret of his Revelation this great light of Revelation is always blinded the wisdom of this world in the days of Jesus Christ when he was here on Earth they had blinded them they said why you even make yourself God you you make yourself equal with God and because of that they wanted to Stone him right brother says he was not only equal with God he was God himself see they don't get it everything the prophet said he was he was amen everything was prophesied him he was there in the flesh fulfilling his own word amen but the light of Jesus Christ blinded their eyes and they said you make yourself equal to God he wasn't just equal to God he was God and they wanted to kill the very one that they claimed to worship because the light blinded them praise God but there was thankfully some who could see so you see the night creatures or Children of the Night they flourish I should say this in the Moonlight is that right so in the cycle of night under the moon dispensations which is the church ages the the children of the night they can flourish right the children of the day they just just enough light to keep moving forward but the Children of the Night can flourish that's why they don't want to leave the church age dispensation because it's under Moonlight and the laodicean age is just a sliver of light going into total darkness which is great for a creature of the night so they don't want to leave that church dispensation because they can see there amen but when they get into the light their blind as a bat brother Branham said so they don't want to leave where they can see because when they step out of that they can't see nothing makes sense I can't find my way I can't get oriented foreign but the children of the day when they finally slip out of that laodicea in darkness they finally come into the day and say praise God I can see now it makes sense to me now I understand now I know why I've always felt this way now I know why I always wanted this and loved this and didn't love that now I know who I am and where I came from and where I'm going to and why the prophet said everything he said praise God thanks for the light [Applause] but the children the church age Children of the darkness want to stay in darkness because that's where they flourish that's where they can see that's where the Bible makes sense to them but to us there was always questions why this and why that and why and it doesn't I don't understand this I don't understand that and when God turned on the light at the opening of The Seven Thunders and we stepped into the light all of a sudden that's why and that's why and that's why that's why the fall in the garden had to be covered by Blood that's why there had to be a human sacrifice that's why I feel the way I do praise be to God I thank God he's turned on the lights amen let's go to Second Corinthians chapter 4 together second Corinthians chapter four verse 3. second Corinthians 4 and 3 but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost and whom the God of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God which shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus Christ's sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God and the face of Jesus Christ why because Christ is the mystery of God revealed it's what this ties to but we have this treasure what treasure this Revelation in the face of Jesus Christ of God we have this treasure where in Earth and vessels where is this treasure it's in me where is this Revelation in me where is this light turned on in me amen we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us it wasn't us it's him praise God oh I love the word brother remember says in the unveiling of God he says now someone many has been saying to me and theologians said brother Branham if the Lord God said if with your experience that the Lord has given you for his people humbly saying this said you would be eligible to write a Bible yourself your word if God has manifested I said that might be true see he was trying to catch me and I said but you see I couldn't do that he said why couldn't you you have all the qualifications I said but you look one word cannot be added or taken away see he said well then them seven Thunders you said when them seven Thunders blasting out won't that be a revelation be given to some man I said no sir it would be adding something to it or taking something from it it's all revealed in there and the Seven Seals opened up the revelation of what that was that's why when brother Branham went to the seven Thunders when he went to Revelation 10 1-7 amen when he went back he went back and interpreted what the Seven Seals when it was in symbol form what it was talking about it was already in there it was just hidden couldn't add anything to it couldn't be a new revelation it had to be the unspoken part and that's what the revealing of the Seven Seals revealed that's what it was all about so it's all revealed in there so I want to read this again what this man said he says well them them seven Thunders because brother Ben have been saying all along he's not even written not even written in the Bible never written anywhere them seven Thunders wouldn't them seven Thunders blasting out won't that be a revelation given to some man but if I said no sir it would be adding something to it or taking something from it it's all revealed in there and the Seven Seals opened up the revelation of what that was that's what it was see it's still in the word you see you can't get out of that word it won't leave the word and God's spirit will never leave that word it'll stay right with the word blinding some and opening the eyes of others it'll always do that blinding some and opening the eyes of others aren't you glad you live in the day it opened your eyes because if it wasn't for the predestination of God and the grace of God it would blinded you you can't see because you wanted to see you can't see because you tried to see you can only see because you you've been predestinated to be a child of the light is the only reason you can see and so if you can see there's no Pride that comes with being able to see there's only a heart of gratitude for what God has done for us there's a Thanksgiving that Wells up in us because I know I'm helpless to see unless God made me see I would be like everybody else running back into the shadows of laodicea so that I could stay in a familiar place where I can see and understand but it's the god predestinated me for another purpose and when I come into the light out of the darkness I'll admit to you when I first walked into it I had to Blink hard a few times and it took me a little while to get oriented amen it was so bright and so much and so so much information and so overwhelming it took me just a little while I splinted for a while and I blinked for a little while but once I got accustomed to what I was predestinated for I looked around and I could see the colors and I could see the vibrancy and I'm still discovering what God has revealed in the turning on of the line we're still exploring our Bible under the light amen praise God now let's go to John chapter three I want to just maybe jump tracks a little bit but it's not really off my subject but hang with me I want to take a look at John chapter three now I want to look at some things brother Branham says because he so clearly declares what the seven Thunders are he so clearly ties the seven Thunders with the seventh seal with the Revelation contained in the seals with the coming of the Lord he so clearly ties it together but then he always makes so many comments like we're waiting for the coming of the Lord and and it's not revealed it's not to be made known to the public but it'll be made known in the hour that's so we have all of these statements and I want to I want to look at these statements for a minute in John chapter 3 verse 22. John chapter 3 verse 22 after these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea and there he teared with them and baptized and John also was baptizing in Enon near to Salem because because there was much water there and they came and were baptized for John was not yet cast into prison I don't want to look at this for just a second there was a period of time after the Forerunner declared the the Lamb of God Behold the Lamb of God who take away the sin of the world he saw uh the the spirit of God to sin like a dove and rest upon him he saw it and he declared who the spirit told me this is the one and Behold the Lamb of God to taketh away the sin of the world the Forerunner had declared what he had come to forerun and he says he's here and he's them but he didn't stop his ministry he kept on baptizing unto repentance he continued on he was not yet in prison he didn't close up shop and then go follow Jesus around because there was more people he had to point towards Jesus and he was still doing the work of a forerunner of Malachi 3 preparing the way and Malachi the first part of Malachi 4 turning the hearts of the the fathers to the children and so he didn't he didn't change his ministry after he declared Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world after he recognized the coming of the Lord he continued on in the same Ministry okay everything in the Bible runs parallel for 20 verse 24 for John was not yet cast into prison then there arose questions between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying and they came unto John and said unto him Rabbi he that was with thee Beyond Jordan to whom thou bearest witness behold he the same baptizes and all men come to him like John's going to be angry that they're going to Jesus but yet he's still baptizing and some are still coming to him does that make sense John answerner said a man can receive nothing except to be given him from heaven so what's he saying don't receive it in the hour they're supposed to receive it ye sells bear me witness that I said I am not the Christ but that I am sent before him he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom would standeth and heareth him rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice thus my joy therefore is fulfilled he must increase but I must decrease so we see that in in John the Baptist the first Forerunner when he came amen he he didn't close up shops Stop his ministry and go shut down but he kept calling people into repentance preparing the way for the Lord amen and I just wanted this is just me this is just surmising I don't have any way of knowing but how many people did he baptize after he declared Behold the Lamb of God Amen that would later come to the revelation of Christ under Peter's Ministry yes why because the the it'll be revealed in the hour it's supposed to be revealed he was there still fulfilling Malachi 3 in the first part of Malachi 4. all right now brother Branham says in the message the unveiling of God in 1964 he says he did it in the reformers taken on a veil taken on a veil until finally it come down through the Luther age down through the other age then finally it comes out into the complete was that the revelation of Jesus Christ in Bride form it comes through the complete just before it comes a prophet arises again what it does is foreshadows the word showing back here revealing what's been done what's been left off that the church will be not without understanding then when this Fades out then like John said I must decreased he must increase so brother Brown is following in the same exact pattern then all in all comes into him he is fully manifested through Luther Wesley Pentecostal agent on down and on down he is fully manifested you see come down just a manifestation God unfolding see him uh fulfilled in his promises for this day as they had so Jesus said as that comes then it must be I must decrease he must increase it must decrease he must increase and and brother Branham had come to this point where he declared amen what God had done he had he had preached the seven Thunders the revelation of the Seven Seals showing that the lamb had taken the book and the mighty angel had come down but he continued to go to Pentecostals he continued to go out to those who hadn't yet received it and he continued to do the work that God had him to do and he continued to talk to them in the language that they would understand and he continued to tell them now we know we're looking for the coming of the Lord and all of these things brother Brandon's not denying everything else he said but he's continuing on in his ministry to the Pentecostal age because it'll be revealed in the hour it's supposed to be revealed and it's not given to all men to know but it's given unto some so he's continually showing them that we're looking for the coming of the Lord and he's continually doing the work of Forerunner and he's continually showing the first and second and third pull all the way through to the end of his ministry and he's continuing to grab people all the way through the end of his ministry and Beyond amen I know for me it took the first and second pull to get my attention so that Ministry was still working for me in 1999 the first and second poll was still at work I I saw amen the manifestation I saw God and the man I saw Christ amen I saw the discernment I saw the gift of Prophecy it got my attention and then I got hooked on the third pull by the opening of the word so the the ministry is still working today it still continues on it doesn't mean that the Lord didn't come in 1963 but I'll tell you he cometh he's coming amen he cometh go out to join him he cometh go out to him you he's still coming and you can still go out to him he's still coming to individuals and you can still go out to him they're still an individual that's that's hearing the first pull they're still an individual somewhere that's getting attracted by the second Bull there's still a fish that's getting close to that hook and getting ready to bite the third pull the ministry is still continuing on and it'll be revealed in the hour it's supposed to be revealed [Music] amen it's not a cut off if it was a cut off I was cut out but it's an event it's a transition it's a change in dispensation and now we're entering into the new dispensation and now we go out to meet him brother M says in questions and answers on the seals is the last day he's preaching the seals this evening he'll preach the seventh seal and now in the morning he's doing questions and answers on the seals and this is what he says is and then also know that right among you things are happening then I'm just I I know I know that you don't see it I'm just positive that you don't see it what was happening the revelation of the Thunders were taking place day by day and they weren't catching it I'm positive that you don't see it and you say brother Brandon that's a hard thing for you to say that I know it is but look let me just say this now I suppose this is just on tapes for ourselves and so forth but let me say this you don't you don't get it and you're not supposed to get it so don't try to interpret anything see don't try to put your interpretation to it you only get further away just take my advice if you believe me now if God has given me favor in your sight you know that them Revelations and things I've been here with you a long time and it's always been right and now to double prove it right it hooks right in with the word see so you know it's thus saith the Lord that's exactly it's proved to you now take my advice as your brother don't put your own interpretation to anything you just go on and live a good Christian life because you'll only wind yourself away from the real thing when you do it you only wind your way again away from the thing and all of you are conscious and know that there's something mysterious happening and it's happening and I know what it is now I'm not saying that it's the grace of God that lets me know what what that is is something that's tremendous and it's gone right now and there's not a way in the world for you to see it but so help me with this Bible in my hand I know what it is it's been told you before when was it told to them and serves is this the time and the preach and serves us at the time and the brick he told them what it was going to be then he comes to the to the revelation of it and then he says are you getting it do you see it something's happening all around you I know you're not getting it you're not supposed to get it don't even try to get it just live for Christ amen because it'll be revealed in the hour it's supposed to be revealed it's been told you before so just don't try to put any interpretation but just believe me as your brother we're living in a great hour we're living in a time where where well you just be real humble be a Christian and try to live for God and live honest with your fellow man and love those who don't love you don't try to make any you see you do you only make it a mysterious something and mess the real program of God up yesterday afternoon something happened in my room that I'll never be able to leave it this is when he was coming to The Sixth Seal I'll never be able to leave it you see and about two weeks ago something happened that I'll never be able to as long as I live on this Earth and that's when he got caught up into the constellation of angels and he ties those two things together he says that that I'll never be able to as long as I live on this Earth I'll never be able to get away from it see and so but now I want you to catch what he says but if the church you're not supposed to know these things so don't put no interpretation to anything see you just go ahead and just remember what you're told live a Christian Life he says the church you're not supposed to know these things why because this is not a revelation that's for the church this is a revelation that's for an individual bride one by one it is not a group dispensation he's not preaching the seven seal series and imparting the Revelation upon everybody in the room he said don't even try don't interpret nothing you just live humble if God wants you to know anything he'll reveal it to you this is not a church Revelation this is a revelation to the bride as individuals who will receive it individually one at a time when God ordains this is not something that's taught this is not something that's imparted amen this is something that's open and God's timing in the hour that it's meant to be revealed it'll be revealed you can walk a long time close to the truth and still not see it you can hear it preached multiple times but when God is ready to open the key of Revelation to you and he opens the door and all of a sudden Aha and all the dominoes fall and everything falls in the place that wasn't you that wasn't the gift of a Preacher amen that was God that was God's time for you to see it don't try to put any interpretation to it don't try to figure it out you just live a simple Christian Life and when God's time comes he'll reveal it to you the church isn't supposed to get it the bride is the group isn't supposed to catch it in one series of sermons the individual members of his body are supposed to catch it individually remember the third pull is tied in with the seventh seal is tied in with the revelation of the seven Thunders and remember the vision of the third pool amen when he was supposed to be fishing to catch the rainbow trout amen and he got caught up amen he was looking over this Cathedral and there was a on the platform a little box and they were going in one by one right and the pillar of fire went down he saw go into the box people were coming one by one they were coming in in firm they were coming out healed they were coming in Afflicted they were going out whole amen so that it was an individual person going into a private place to meet the pillar of Fire right and the angel said he says I'll meet you in there it won't be a public show this is not broke to the public this is broke to the bride individually amen it's not a public show and he says this will be your third pull so this is not a church Revelation this is not a Doctrine to be taught this is an event to take place in your life amen and the message the Feast of the trumpets President says now this is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ he passed his Bible he said in the Seven Seals had the mystery hid of what it it was all about and it's supposed to open in the last day at the laodicean age at the end of time thanks be to God that finishes the message through the church that finishes it when they look back and see what was been and see where it's all been brought up to that finishes it the age of the church so the opening of the seals finished the age of the church it's sealed it's done now it opens the bright age and this Revelation is to the individual let's go to Isaiah 60. Isaiah 60 and verse 1. arise Shine for thy lightest come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness to people but the Lord shall arise upon thee in his glory shall be seen upon thee the the seven Thunders produced the evening lights Shalom good morning little bride it's a good morning to you as an individual when the light rises in your life it's it's shalom it's good morning it's peace it's new day it's all of this when the light arises in your individual hearts he says in the message it is the rising of the Sun said not long ago I was told a little story about a fisherman a fellow come out and hired an old fisherman to take him fishing out on the west coast they went out that morning if any of you had fish out there for the salmon why you know what takes place it gets awfully foggy out there I see my little brother Eddie bisco down here a missionary to the Indians out there and we fished ourselves out on those coasts so this fisherman was kind of a green horn you know and he went fishing and they drifted out waiting for daylight to come you know and and they couldn't hear the Foghorn no more and this fisherman got all excited and said say we're drifting out to sea hey get got all excited he said sit down son sit down the old fisherman quiet you know he knowed what he was talking about said just wait until the sun comes up then we can see where we're at you say must I be Methodist Baptist Pentecostal just wait the sun comes up we'll see where we're at he is the word wait till you see the word manifested shining across the seed the wave sheep will see where we're at amen don't get excited don't run to and fro don't try to figure anything out just wait till the sun rises in your heart and all of a sudden the Revelation clicks which is all up to God not up to us amen we can consecrate ourselves to it we can pray we can read amen but it takes God to turn on the light but I want to tell you there's a man here that can turn on the light amen there is a man present and that man is Christ Jesus and there's a man here that can turn on the light and when he turns on the light if you're a Child of the Light then you'll see what you've not been able to see before amen so the question is is the seventh seal open yes is the seventh seal revealed yes does the seventh seal still need to be revealed yes but it'll be revealed in the hour it's supposed to be revealed but I'm not waiting for that hour somebody else maybe for me he's turned on the light for me I've seen this coming I've recognized my day and its message to me it's shalom to me it's good morning to me it's the rising of the sun to me I was lost at sea and denominationalism but the sun came up Drew away the fog and now I know where I'm at amen that doesn't mean it's open to every seed amen it still needs to be open the ministry of the three pools still needs to go forth amen that Ministry of Malachi 4 still needs to be out upon the Earth but hey for me the Sun is up amen for me the Revelation has struck home and I pray for every seed of God that's out there that in The Hour That is supposed to be revealed it'll be revealed We've Got Confidence he won't lose one man no it's it's it's not complicated it it's full of details why why do you say that brother Chad because it's the opening of the whole Bible it's the whole plan and mystery of God he's held in his heart since the foundation of the world do you think that's simplistic like that can be explained in 30 seconds this is the whole entire heart's desire and thought of God there's lots of details but the revelation of it is simple in the appointed time he turned on the light he he come and revealed the hidden Mystery that nobody was able to discern why wasn't it written in the Bible why is revelation 8 1 the seventh seal written the way it's written and why is revelation 10 1-7 written the way it's written it's written so nobody can tamper with it nothing is written there it would take a prophet who God can come down himself and show that the lamb is the only one who can open this so that he would get to his children there's only one person that can do this and it's not William Branham there's only one person who can do this and that's the mighty Angel who comes down with an open book in Islam so that that bride would say wait a minute wait a minute according to the Bible he has to be here amen according to the Bible the lamb has to take the book according to the Bible he's present and I must go out and Unite with him and he'll take me into the marriage something now is the wedding time for those who can come those who've recognized the seventh seal it's your wedding day some of you been married for a while something you've been married recently some of you are yet to be married but in the hour it's supposed to be revealed it'll be revealed God bless you let's all stand I just thank God for the revelation of his word for me as the Bible keeps opening and opening the message keeps opening it gets simpler and simpler and simpler that it's him coming to an individual to unite and become one so that is now Christ with preeminence in your flesh that's what he wants to accomplish in this hour and not just in one person but in the entire body around the world but it'll come one by one in our appointed season and musicians if you could come and brother John if you'll make your way up this is bow our head and thank the Lord dear heavenly father I thank you Lord Jesus for your word is so precious to us Lord God there's no way we can express our gratitude and words for what you've given to us and Lord with all of our heart Lord we we want to share what you shared with us but it seems so impossible to take what's in our heart and take it out and put it in somebody else's heart so I'm asking God that you would come and turn on the lights I pray God that you would come and break the seals of individual hearts and lives that you would unlock the mystery of lives Lord that they would see the light that they would hear the bridegroom call and that they would leave everything and come and Unite with you enter into the marriage Union and walk with you all the way to the marriage supper for God we're in a transition time transitioning out of this world transitioning out of the natural into the supernatural we're leaving Lord we're in a journey we're in the Rapture we're moving Lord we're not stationary we're not waiting we're in progress help us to keep walking with you keep growing in this light keep learning of you and becoming more like you and may we continually give you more preeminence Lord and may this Revelation change us day by day God we want to give you first place and everything in every way we pray God that the preaching of the word would be effective in the hearts and lives of your children may you use it Lord to stimulate Revelation may you use it to open doors of understanding and may the eyes come open me the preaching of the word bring isab to your children give us greater Vision Lord greater understanding oh how we love you father we ask that you would have preeminence Among Us be glorified in US finish the work that you set aside for this hour finish it through these vessels of clay as we yield to your hand do you accomplish what you've ordained to accomplish through us we love you and we give you first place in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you brother John I have written my love secrets in a book you love so well just look a
