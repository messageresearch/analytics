[0:00] how were you sealed with the holy spirit
[0:03] not because you came up here and cried
[0:05] not because you came up here and shouted
[0:07] not because you danced around you spoke
[0:09] in tongues you have a ministry you have
[0:11] gifts of healing you have supernatural
[0:13] you have prophecy you have this that and
[0:15] the other
[0:17] you were sealed with the holy spirit
[0:19] under one condition
[0:23] after that ye have heard the words of
[0:25] truth the gospel of your salvation you
[0:29] believed
[0:33] do not allow somebody to tell you that
[0:36] it's anything other than that can it
[0:38] come with all of those things that i
[0:39] just described absolutely but you can
[0:42] also have all of those things i just
[0:43] described before this happens
[0:49] in and of itself
[0:51] there is only one evidence for the true
[0:53] baptism of the holy spirit
[0:55] receiving the truth for your age
[0:59] period
[1:02] that might make you jump and shout and
[1:04] stand on your head
[1:05] it may make a tear trickle out of the
[1:07] corner of your eye or it may have
[1:09] absolutely no response on you except for
[1:12] a changed life
[1:15] that it will have
[1:18] but that changed life may not even be
[1:21] represented in a physical viewing it may
[1:24] simply be that you changed within
[1:27] because again you take somebody that's
[1:29] born in this message in a real godly
[1:32] christian atmosphere and home
[1:34] they may already be walking the walk
[1:37] and talking the talk
[1:40] and may have all of you fooled
[1:44] but the only person they can't fool is
[1:46] themselves
[1:48] and they know they don't have the goods
[1:49] because they don't have the peace and
[1:51] the comforter on the inside
[1:53] but when they hear the words of truth
[1:55] and they believe on that they receive
[1:58] the comforter and the peace on the
[2:00] inside and they're the only ones that
[2:02] know about it and there's nothing
[2:04] external that
[2:06] changes that's why i say it can come
[2:09] with a lot of things or it may not come
[2:10] with anything outwardly
[2:13] but one thing is for certain
[2:15] you as the individual will know
[2:18] maybe nobody else will know but you will
[2:20] know
[2:21] that you have received the words of
[2:23] truth for your age
[2:25] and it doesn't really matter what
[2:27] everybody else knows and what everybody
[2:28] else sees and whatever everybody else
[2:30] thinks
[2:32] you're the one
[2:34] you're the one that has to know
[2:36] you're the one that matters
