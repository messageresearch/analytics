our bibles to joshua 6 20 hallelujah it's good to be here tonight and to be part of the plan of god amen praise the lord it's all good amen i just want to say that some of you have seen me wear my ball cap that i brought with me and and it says the house of pain that that's that's not the name of our church amen that's uh that's the fire station that i retired from and it says engine three the house of pain because you're up all night praise the lord so god's good and i just want to say that probably i would say that this last year has been the greatest time with god amen see we're not focusing on the chaos we're focusing on what he's speaking to us amen we're focusing on the spoken word amen we're focusing on what he means to us and so i can really say that it's been the greatest time of my whole life amen so i say praise god let's read joshua 6 20. so the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat so that the people went in went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city lord we just thank you that you are here lord and god you're a mighty god we cry of a father thank you lord god though things come against us and buffet us lord they are trials of our faith they're much more precious than of gold lord and we truly believe that you are in it lord we thank you that you're in this place tonight lord we just praise you and thank you so much lord thank you for the anointing thank you for the holy spirit being here lord and god we thank you for speaking lord in advance we just thank you in the name of jesus christ amen praise the lord jesus amen you may be seated i want to speak on the anointed word is always the anointed word no matter where it is hallelujah god is god no matter where he is and he he he said that the earth is the fullness thereof amen and so he he fills all space and time he is everywhere he's there by uh he's omnipresent omniscient amen he's all of those descriptive words that we find in the bible and so everywhere that anointed word is amen there is children of god amen it doesn't matter what country what church what what is going on in the world it because he has to have she amen as the song said has to have she with their little antennae up amen picking up what the word is trying to say in this day and i tell you what she is not weak she is not broken down amen she's not hunched over from the load of laodicea amen but she is vibrant and full of her husband amen she she knows by revelation that he is the same yesterday today and forever amen hallelujah that's the god that we serve amen you you should this whole past year i'm sure that he's growing you in the fact that you you change your whole thinking on prayer and and when you pray you say hey let's pray as a family and we're going to speak that into existence amen hallelujah that's you amen and we've been doing that this whole year god's been doing things and doing things and doing things amen and so it it's all about relationship amen it's all about brother mam said if if we it's not the big things we leave undone but it's the little things that we leave out amen hallelujah but when you come into an intimate relationship then you begin to have a love affair to do the little things amen and this message is not about do's and don'ts but it is about a love affair amen hallelujah and so i wanted to start out with joshua because we're going to look at uh some other scriptures in first samuel chapter four and chapter five and and there's there's some of my favorites because it really gives the devil the black eye and so we i wanted to start off with something positive because we're gonna have to talk about some negative things but we're we're bringing it back hey man uh you gotta stretch this way sometimes to come back in the middle and stretch this way to come back in the middle but i but i know that my redeemer lives amen and as you as his bride those that are converted those that are predestinated hallelujah amen you should have a confidence the the scripture says that that we are the head and not the tale amen the the the prosperity people hijack that but that is for us amen what goes first forward it's the head and the head is higher than the body amen what what is the last anointing for this age it's an eagle so that you can see all the potholes in the road bumps amen that is not for the church member that is not for the unbeliever that is for you the bride of christ amen hallelujah so i know that god wants us to take a hold of him tonight amen and and just believe him and receive him hallelujah praise the lord jesus first samuel 4 3-11 and when the people were come to into the camp the elders of israel said wherefore hath the lord spitting us today before the philistines amen see remember joshua did the same thing he fell on his face and he goes god why did we lose these men why and god goes joshua get up there's sin in the camp joshua goes oh okay amen so god had to tell him what was going on because joshua's went back to oh what are they going to think that god brought us out and didn't deliver his people no there was sin in the camp amen and so joshua took courage then and he went and found the sin and they purged the sin amen it says let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the lord out of shiloh unto us that when it cometh among us it may save us out of the hand of the enemies do you hear what he said it isn't amen but did you hear what they said there was no remorse there was no repentance of life there was no oh god have we sinned have we done something or not done something go get the go get the the ark amen and bring it and it will deliver us hallelujah so the people sent to shiloh that they might bring forth thence the ark of the covenant of the lord of hosts which dwells between the cherubims and the two sons of eli hofney and phineas were there with the ark of the lord our god talk about two scoundrels perverts destroyer of people's faith but the people oh here comes the ark oh the priest you know they're carrying it and it's just see there's no conscience there's no consciousness of of of god there it's all a form amen and when the ark of the covenant of the lord came into camp all israel shouted with the great shout so that the earth rang again amen they got cited because they were in a meeting and their favorite pastor and minister was there amen hallelujah and so and when the philistines heard the noise of the shout they said what mean at this noise of this great shout in the camp of the hebrews and they understood that the ark of the lord was coming to the camp and the philistines were afraid for they said god is common to the camp see they they had heard they haven't they hadn't tasted it firsthand but they'd heard the testimony of what would happen and they began to be afraid amen and and they said whoa unto us for there hath not been such a thing heretofore woe unto us who shall deliver who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods these are the gods that smote the egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness be strong and and quit yourself right men oh you philistines see someone spoke up that you be not servants unto the hebrews as they have been unto you quit yourselves like men and fight they were going to fight it they were going to fight to the death amen hallelujah oh ye philistines that you okay and the philistines fought and israel was smitten and they fled every man into his tent and there was a very great slaughter for their fell of israel thirty thousand foot men and the ark of the of god was taken and the two sons of eli hofney and phineas were slain amen and so what had just happened they were they were message believers amen and and and we're going to see that what went on up to this point is that there there was a a a dropping of the ball i say that in the leadership of what god really wanted and the communication of that love affair that jehovah god wanted and so all of these people went into battle thinking that they were covered by the blood and they were not amen hallelujah praise the lord the israelites had been a long time without the without the truth in reality amen and so i'm not speaking tonight really of signs and wonders and miracles i'm talking about the truth of reality of all of your your feelings your thoughts amen your job your school amen a need that arises that all things are brought under subjection casting down all imagination and anything that exalts itself against god because you are not a church member you're not a make-believer you are part of jesus christ amen and you have to stay with it amen you can't you can't give up your rights amen glory to god praise the lord they had been too long without reality so they didn't know brother madam speaks frequently that people are good people they just weren't taught right amen they didn't understand that there's a way of approach to god and a way for him to come on the scene and there's a way for him to manifest the way of his word amen he he's everywhere he that anointed word is here tonight amen and he's looking for somebody to say yes lord he's looking for somebody to say lord i'm gonna believe this word no matter what no matter if i have to wear a mask no matter if i have to drive the speed limit right the devil doesn't look at this pass that says i'm a message believer i can break all the laws amen i'm just being honest that this has been good because it's really brought out some little old men and little ladies who are rebels praise the lord but god god god's spanking us enough that we finally wake up and say oh because see and i know your pastor preached on this but i i i like to kind of poke the bear a little bit do you think he's going to bless you if you don't pay your tithes or give offerings no you may think he does but he doesn't amen do you see what i'm trying to say is what what is what defines the bride of jesus christ every word agreeing with it believing it every word and so that's all the little things and so that's what i'm trying to encourage us tonight we can't walk all over uh these things and that's why god let the covenant come amen so that we would release our rights a paul and silas they didn't fight for their rights amen there's too much politics we're too much a democrat or republican we need to be christians amen hallelujah and because god's pulling us out of laodicean spirits so that we can walk with him amen hallelujah we want to walk with him in love amen when i speak something i expect it to manifest amen amen hallelujah but see they had been so long without that that they had forgotten but there's there's hope and we're going to see it in a little bit amen god god had a little boy raising up in the temple who was sold out amen hallelujah he has brides all over this world raised up for this day to sell out and just to say there's nothing wrong we are right where we're supposed to be hallelujah we are more than conquerors amen amen and i'm going to give some testimonies in a while but it's not a work up amen it is an absolute no-so hallelujah see the philistines knew what that ark meant isn't it strange that israelites really didn't have a revelation of that there's other there's other people on the outside of this uh what we call the message and they they have better revelation of the reality of the word than some message people do hallelujah but but don't worry the bride she's right where she's supposed to be amen hallelujah proverbs 14 12 there is a way that's which seems right unto a man but the end thereof is the ways of death oh that's what this year has done give up just finally relax and let god lead don't be afraid to step out don't be afraid to pray and speak something into existence when you go to a hotel don't you pray and bind those spirits that is you're speaking an atmosphere into existence and so with the and see you can't do this and be religious you can't do this and just be a message person amen you have to be in christ amen hallelujah ii samuel 22 29 and 31 for thou art my lamp o lord praise god and the lord will lighten my darkness for by thee i have run through a troop by my god have i leaped over a wall as for god his way is perfect and the word of the lord is tried get that he is a buckler that all them that of all that trust in him amen and so the word amen not your thought not your favorite pastor not your favorite evangelist the actual word and you say well how do we know what is the actual word because it manifests it comes to pass amen and so when that is tried in your life then you know he is your shield and buckler you know absolutely that what you say will come to pass amen and don't doubt in your heart because you are part of him don't you set down in his throne you have authority over everything that's the earmark that's the trait of the bride amen that's why you're persecuted because you don't paul says i don't judge myself by others and that's why i don't i don't we don't judge ourselves by other message people right we don't judge ourselves by other other churches because last time i checked we're all sovereign but it's those that compare themselves with themselves that's a dangerous road to walk amen you you your grandmother your father your mother art is not your experience but you have to let go and compare your life with the word amen and i'll keep saying it over and over there's nothing greater than the word amen and i'm not just saying that i'm really meaning the word hallelujah and so the revelation of the bride allows her the revelation of the bride allows her to have a living expectation amen good people are may not be there yet but we all have to come to adoption we have to be useful in the body amen but it's that revelation amen that she has a living expectation on the word amen it's not just a mental concept praise the lord hallelujah and so she expects her god just like the wives expect the husband to fix the car that's in the driveway broke amen just like the wife expects the husband to pay the electric in the gas bill praise the lord but this is a greater expectation yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil and you will only do that as the revealed bride of jesus christ by the word in this day amen what does he do he puts your entire life in order no more out of order there's no more out of order sign in your house praise the lord your kids are in order your relationship's in order well brother how can you say that because i'm speaking it into existence and it's by the word the token puts your house in order well i don't see it well don't quit looking believe it amen it's it's it br i promise you it brings everything into order amen and and god becomes the discerner of the thoughts and intents of your heart and your house amen glory to god he is absolutely real remember this is this is your benefit as a believer tonight amen hallelujah and so there's no other order but the word of god oh we we have fun amen i used to say you know you can put a camera up in my house and and what we are here is there my kids lately they've been going maybe you better take that statement back because you act pretty crazy amen they're probably right but see sometimes things may seem like the will of god and again a lot of good people get told things that brother branham said or or this is where we should go and it may seem right and and but what are what are you doing amen you're you're actually going to step into something step into a situation step into a relationship step into into something that you're going to take on that that may look like the word but it's not the proper time it's not the season amen those that are gonna get married you must be born again amen because then your spouse god will bring the born-again spouse to you amen hallelujah but see it may seem like the will of god but are you allowing god to manifest his word in remember time and season it's all about for the bride time and season praise the lord and so it when you let it be a blessing in the time of season then the blessings will roll from that word it's not you trying to lift yourself up but as you stay in line in order of the word in time and season then you are blessed beyond comprehension the bible says you are blessed going in and you're blessed going out again get your mind off prosperity but i'm not going to sit here and and and and be upset because he meets my needs he says he'll rebuke the devourer he says that he'll meet his your knees he says that he's the same yesterday today and forever he says that your family that your wife's womb amen that all these things are blessed because you're just following the word why was the word restored so the bride could live out a blessing that she could not contain right in the middle of a plague hallelujah we have been blessed amen your flesh and your emotions mind this year all of us have been tore up but i wake up one of them one of them you can't contain it amen because you have been blessed by your husband amen amen blessings are designed to come from the word amen first samuel 5 1-3 and the philistines took the ark of god and brought it from ebenezer unto ashdod when the philistines took the ark of god they brought it into the house of dagon and sat it by dagon this is i think is so god has a sense of humor and when they of ashdod arose early in the morrow behold dagon dagon was fallen upon his face and on the earth before the ark of the lord and they took dagon and set him back up amen this went on for three nights but the last time god cut his head off and cut his palms off and says nothing will stand before me amen i am is here i am the anointed word amen our thoughts our feelings we come to the point where we surrender that because he says nothing will stand before me amen nothing will stand before my word amen and i'm purposely putting you through these trials and tribulations so that you can stand there blessed beyond comprehension amen hallelujah first samuel 5 8-12 they sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the philistines unto them and said what shall we do with the ark of the of the god of israel and they answered let the ark of the god of israel be carried about unto gath and they carried the ark of the lord of god of israel about thither and it was so that after they carried it about the hand of the lord was against the city with a very great destruction and he smote the men of the city both small and great and they had emeralds in their secret parts amen therefore they sent the ark to another place they sent the ark of god to ekron and it came to pass as the ark of god came upon came to ekron that the achronites cried out saying they have brought about the ark of god of israel to slay us amen and our people so they sent and gathered all the lords of the philistines and said send away the ark of god of israel and let it go down to its own place that it slay us not and our people for there was a deadly destruction all throughout all the city the hand of god was very heavy there and the men that died not were smitten with the emirates and the cry of the city went up to heaven oh if i ever think of a of a of a church that that just will not allow god to work the way he wants the word to come to pass what is it people died literally in those days amen people died of leprosy literally but see people are dying spiritually because they're they just don't know what this god is all about they think he's defined by their church by their pastor by by what they read or don't read amen and they they they bring a destruction upon them and their family oh it is sad amen and i don't want to see that amen i want god to be unleashed to everyone the proper way in the proper time hallelujah and so the anointed word of god in a in a church is alive and it will pour out a blessing upon individuals but it will also bring ruin and judgment on others that's why you can sit in the same church and somebody says he called me an eagle we had that happen in new zealand somebody my dad was preaching a couple came up to brother gray alfred afterwards and says that man called us chickens brother alfred says well he called me an eagle amen it's whatever you identify with sometimes that you're preaching people start identifying with the mule instead of the thoroughbred horse see that's satan don't let him do that to you he he's a master of mind battles amen and and you in yourself will not win that battle but you always have jesus christ the anointed word ready to pour out the living part of that letter into your life amen hallelujah oh but he's always here amen did you know that the pillar of fire is here right now if we don't believe that something's wrong amen i know you do amen because you're here he's here amen and there's angels all over the place and so i want to see that the people of god i i i want them to regain that lost revelation that personal revelation of this word amen because there's a lack of conviction and care for the word of god amen how can we cast all of our care upon him if we don't know that he really does care i i challenged you to prove him amen there's no time limit on it so you prove it and allow god to work tonight amen hallelujah amen you can't handcuff god he says that you pray and believe he says first here's the big thing you have to repent well brother i i have a revelation of this and i i don't think i need to do this over here repent about this okay but don't plan on getting healed you have to repent that's why when we come to get healed we always repent of anything and say lord quicken something to my to my heart and let me make that right amen god does not heal you if you don't repent praise the lord hallelujah amen see a lack of conviction and you people get so oh we're in the bride and we're this and that have you there's a persecution for those that want to follow the word and i know that you understand that amen hallelujah but but it's because you have a god-consciousness right a woman has a husband consciousness amen and so no matter if he gets fat and bald no matter if she is three or four hundred pounds she's still a revelation he is still a revelation right amen and so no matter what anybody says around you uh in this church or other churches hallelujah it it it may hurt the the feelings a little bit but here say lord i praise you and i thank you because you are my revelation amen and i this puts me under conviction i when you're in your reading you you see something you say lord i'm sorry forgive me for not doing or doing this and god i'm going to put this under the blood and you're going to see a new person amen hallelujah you say well that's just the way it is is it is that sensitivity all over the world i say no in the bride it is and so that's where we have to stop identifying as groups god does not deal with groups he deals with individuals amen and we are at the time when the group called the message is the shock and the bride is the seed of god bride in those churches doesn't mean those are bad people at all it's just i'm not taking up for him anymore love everyone i have no hatred i have no ill feelings towards anyone because i'm part of god i'm a little messiah i have divine love for everyone but when it comes to the word it's the word and you will be shunned by not so much the world but by message people and i just say if you want to do that that's up to you but we're setting here with open arms amen hallelujah but see the philistines they knew what the ark could do they had a revelation of it but when they quickly realized that they were fighting a people who were had just a painted fire then they said oh we see what's going on they don't really believe and they swooped in and they defeated them amen and because they knew that the ark would do them no good amen hallelujah praise the lord this is nuclear power folks see you thought it was just paper and some black and red ink but when god sent a prophet and opened the word to us then it became nuclear power you mean that's been sitting there i've had all these books on top of it god forgive me may i never put anything on this bible amen hallel not even message books this is the word hallelujah don't cover it up don't be ashamed but how many denominational thinking people today are in this same situation where they know intellectually that god is real but but they don't have the conviction or the sensitivity to say i'm gonna do that amen but they they want to worship how they want oh brother i've been in the message a long time and i just don't see i don't think that god that god cares about that okay keep being defeated keep having your kids tore up keep having all these other things going on amen and it's not always like that because sometimes the devil will let that person prosper physically and all sorts of things but when it comes down to it then their families ruined and their wife is ruined or their husbands are on amen because they haven't stayed with the revealed word of the hour amen hallelujah yet these fellow scenes they had no desire to change oh i was some pla actually i was at home church and we had a visitor from another church and afterwards he goes hello pastor he goes that was a nice little message okay see i it doesn't hurt my feelings but i'm looking at him saying you're messed up and you're you're making fun of me see what i'm saying that's the devil but at least we know how to pray for him and that's the thing every time somebody comes against you then you know how to pray for them you don't write them off you just say okay another one on my list praise the lord amen because prayer changes things but see how many people are in that same situation they intellectually know that god is god but they still want to worship in their own flavor of the message amen there's one flavor excuse me it's the living word flavor it's the open word flavor amen because you know what this open word you and i are walking around as little messiahs we're walking around creating atmospheres we're walking around creating our children we're walking around creating our our work we're walking around manifesting that anointed word through us amen only because of the revelation of this anointed word hallelujah praise the lord we couldn't get through this life without this amen amen a denominational christian cannot do this can't they may be coming out of it but that they can't produce this i challenge anybody in the name of jesus i challenge you to to to love to divinely love you can't do it it takes god it's the living word and so the word of god in the days of eli and the child samuel praise the lord for the prophet coming on the scene amen it says that the word of the lord was precious and there was no open vision and so we we we can see that that god it was time and brother braham says that the word is so precious that he has to send it through a prophet and then he distributes it to the ministry amen hallelujah and so it's all god and it wasn't samuel it was god amen god ordained his mother to cry out for him amen and and to to bring him back to the temple where he grew in grace and it says that he had a good report of all the people amen glory hallelujah and so we see that people they they they had drifted in that time so far from the living word and so no no one knew how to activate it it said that phineas and hufny was so vile that they would go and take the meat from the sacrifice before it was even seed in the pot and they would sleep with the women at the gate amen they were just scoundrels amen it got to the place where people didn't even want to go to church anymore i've seen that amen but see they didn't know how to activate it they didn't know how to handle it and they didn't know what kind of a relationship was needed to bring the blessings of the lord alive in your life amen oh hallelujah this is see the word of god is more than just a mental concept it's a living experience amen and so it was the living the god the word of god was so precious it was so powerful and it was so important to god that he sent samuel to be raised up to reveal the word god he loved you and i so much in this day that he sent a prophet to open and reveal the word amen his commission was to open the word amen glory to god and so the reason why eli he compromised because he didn't know about the reality of god he actually he did and he wouldn't do anything about it that's what the foolish virgin is she's dilatory she sees what it is but she doesn't want to do anything about it amen see so none of that reality was passed on to the people and so they just began to accept that the ark of the covenant will be there when they need it and we don't want to go to church because the ministers are scoundrels if we're not back there i don't know where we're at amen see they were supposed to be spiritually leading the people and any minister who's not called that steps into this pulpit you were actually killing souls praise the lord oh just let him preach you know he was he wants to preach so bad oh i've seen that over and over crash and burn every time amen and i'm not making fun but i'm just saying we have to prove all things amen and we and brother chad lets people in who he feels god is wanting them to preach and that's exactly what should be done amen he is the shepherd and he should be suspicious of everyone hallelujah but see he eli knew that his sons were wrong because how do you know brother rich because when samuel had the visitation from god samuel goes now son don't hold nothing back and samuel told everything and and eli says god's will be done he was saying i know why didn't you just correct it because the spirit of the day was so strong amen why don't people today correct the word and the spirit in their life because it's so strong upon the people lay at it people are they walk around saying oh laid to see you can't get me i'm a message believer ah sorry it already has amen that's why god wakes up his people to see the anointed words standing in your midst and every day you're praying you cast down imagination by the word the word the word amen and you're going to see why in a little bit i'm saying that so that spirit of the age weighed heavy upon eli oh laodicea is a terrible thing amen hallelujah but see he didn't realize what that word really meant amen but see there was there was people around israel that did praise god but it was the leadership that needed that revelation and so we know that that that things haven't changed much today amen where ministers lack revelation to preach and to live the life live the life amen the minister has to live the life i challenge any minister to be transparent i challenge you to let people know how much you spend amen i challenge you to let them know how much money is in in the church amen i challenge you uh for all that i challenge you to to say people if i say something up here that's not right you are obligated to come to me hallelujah we are in that kind of day amen hallelujah but see a lot of good people they're held by fear i don't understand it we are we should be the happiest people on the face of the earth amen we should be the most liberated people on the face of the earth we should be saying what can man do unto me i'm full of the holy spirit with the word of god for my day who can touch me amen do you realize that the devil was created defeated amen and that the only authority he has is because people give it to him hallelujah amen hallelujah we need people to preach the word amen i don't care about entertainment it just who cares amen i don't care about program and church dinners and suppers and and church music videos amen i don't care about that that has nothing to do with god hallelujah but see they're held by fear and but but god holds you by love a good marriage holds you by love and what what is the love based upon it's the word only the word amen hallelujah praise the lord and so throughout all this the ark of the lord was still anointed and powerful throughout laodicea and and and now that we have lived all these years and the old fighters are dead amen and god's raising up a people that that he challenges to love them with all their heart amen and and he they are beginning to see that he is an all-powerful god nothing will stand in his way not even cancer not even unbelief amen glory to god praise the lord he's still anointed he's still victorious praise the lord amen can't we see that the lack of teaching has caused a lack of conviction and revelation oh i just want people you can see it sometimes their faces say brother i want to believe that i'm just afraid to step out don't be afraid just start stepping over the cliff amen and let the word manifest praise the lord amen it's no longer time to live in fear it's no longer time to be depressed it's no longer time to to be upset about the rest of the message or about politics amen it's time to see that lovely one who's coming and playing to you praise the lord proverbs 29 18 where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he how does your vision come by the word well just think if you went to camps and all the ministers were preaching the exact same revelation you talk about a revival at those camps well brother they do they they sing and shout and say amen yeah but they come home the same way so this is rough but what good is it see it should be in the home and so see what's happening is god is getting hold of parents and so the parents are beginning to get this revelation and so their kids are beginning to see firsthand the anointed word coming to pass in their parents that should be the youth camp and and i love getting together i'm not saying that because run jump do whatever you do amen have a good time but it starts at home because that's where they live amen praise the lord and there's nothing wrong with crying out to god none of that i'm not saying that but it's it's all for not if if they're not being taught right and that's why a lot of those ministers go to different camps because they have a burden because the kids aren't being taught right amen proverbs 10 28 the hope this is amplified the hope of the uncompromisingly righteous the upright in right standing with god is gladness but the expectation of the wicked those who are out of harmony with god come to nothing we can't be out of harmony can you imagine if all the musicians were playing a half step different oh you know that doesn't matter they're making a joyful noise oh i'll just let him go no who's in charge our brother there he would come up here and say no it's in whatever see right he's not going to sit there and let him do that and neither is god going to let his church the church of the living god be out of tune because it's an unbeliever who's out of tune who's out of harmony with god and he won't he or she won't stay that way as a daughter or son of god but he'll come into the harmony of the word amen because that's where god meant for us to be is to be harmonious with the word amen oh hallelujah glory to god and i i want to keep going back to this it's only become because jesus christ has been revealed amen in the opening of the word especially from 63 on i love all of it and there he has a lot of the same revelations before that but his commission was for the word was then on amen praise god and so when the armies of israel called for that anointed word to come out and to be in their midst and to defeat their enemies they felt just like before and see that is the stumbling block especially to the young people they say we're supposed to be believing this message and and and they can always go back and show us deep call to the deep and all this other and and tell all the stories and and i love those people but enough is enough it's the generations books are awesome and they're needful but let's create our own book of acts let's i'll say it this way let god create his own book of acts amen and i'm focusing on your attitude towards christ and your family amen and your children and the word of god amen praise the lord jesus and so they were defeated i want us to begin to this one and this one to pop up and say glory to god i i had a need and and and there was some bad feelings between two people and and god came on the scene at my prayer and he delivered us hallelujah amen hallelujah i i don't want to see the bride the bride won't be defeated amen but i want to see all of us start to raise up and get those faith muscles to working hallelujah and so why do you think all the music in the program has changed around this message because the people are defeated the ministry is defeated amen and they're good man but they don't realize that they're allowing the goats to come in because the revelation of the literal word of god has drifted amen i'm sorry if you have to delete this off the website but i've stopped messing around the deception is not out in the denominations it's matthew 24 right here amen hallelujah and so the ministry and now the people have lost the vision even the words of their joshua not the bride see the bride is marching onward christian soldier she's growing but see i don't like to see the rest of the people sad and defeated i don't like it pastors don't like that we're shepherds amen i don't want to see people get upset from the preaching i don't want them to to to say you're not going to take my experience away amen i'm not but what is god saying to us amen and so we know that that it was corrupted vessels and hopped me and and and the other one i can't remember his name right now but they were carrying the word of god they didn't love god but the people were putting their confidence in that ministry oh let's let's just get back to god amen let's just get back to the reality of jesus christ amen israel they could not understand why the message of the hour wasn't working why it wasn't effective i had people talk to me brother where's all the miracles where are the victories and i'm going where have you been people we've baptized three young people lately where have you been for those where have you been for our interpreter instantly getting healed amen the other day where have you been for people coming and accepting christ as their savior where have you been amen hallelujah praise the lord jesus amen don't worry little flock he's effective amen don't worry tonight he's still here in his anointed word and he will do exactly what he says he will do amen hallelujah praise the lord amen the ark was a plague to the enemy you've got god on your hands you're going to be plagued hallelujah no matter where it went though it was powerful no matter where this word is no matter what house it's this sets in it's still atomic weapons amen hallelujah praise the lord jesus and we can see today in his bride all over this world he is the anointed he becomes quick and powerful and sharper than any two-headed sword amen hallelujah and he's bringing this one and this one into revelation of his person and you begin to just eat up amen you don't have to be told to listen to the message you don't have to be told to pray or read your word amen and your pastor he can look out there on sunday and see you eating up the word hallelujah amen god is equipping his bride waking her up and bringing her back into the battle amen bringing her back with an effective sword of the word amen bringing her back to every attitude and everything that is unlike god you cast it down amen hallelujah but that's not to the group the message that's to the individuals in the message it's not meant to the church member it's meant to the special class of people red brown yellow black and white you are a super race see you've got to start thinking you you look in the mirror and it's like i'm fat and bald but i get up and i say i am beautiful thank you lord that you created me i look good amen because i'm your son and you see me as your beautiful bride amen hallelujah amen i got a new sweater the other day and i was in the bathroom and i was kind of posing like my wife comes in and goes what are you doing i'm just just looking hallelujah but see what is going on today we went to the hearst the yeah amherst amen and and they were talking about all the you know you you go there and you're getting all these messages because he's talking about the planning and the right atmosphere and all these things it's like praise the lord amen you just about want to run around shouting amen but see god is nurturing you and i he loves you so much don't worry because it's not you it's him he's nurturing you we can't do anything he is the one to nurture you with his word he draws you up to el shaddai both spiritual and physical healing the old in the new testament amen and so he is the one that does the nurturing and so it's not your church you love your church but it's not your church love your pastor but it's not really him he is a conduit of the word coming forth to bring a nurturing atmosphere so you could grow you know what predestinated seeds are the only ones that will receive eternal life i know foolish virgin she gets eternal life but you are eternal life how co how could you fail how could you believe anything else but the word for our day amen and so you know what you're going to make mistakes i was sawing up we had an ice storm and trees were down and i was sawing things up and i always lock the br the blade when i back up well i didn't this time and all of a sudden i felt something on this leg about right there well now i have chaps praise the lord i had to promise my family you will buy chaps correct and because i cut my leg not bad but the main thing was i ruined my favorite pants amen and so he's nurturing you he's growing you his way and you're gonna make mistakes get used to it but brother brown says that you can live so close to god that your spirit and your s your flesh the holy spirit will even reign those in hallelujah that's a powerful word amen and that only happens to a predestinated seed glory to god amen see everybody should say i'm that one i am that one hallelujah hallelujah amen and so we know that people want to move the word off the pages of the bible then do it speak it and go forward that's what the bride does it may be this you're still going forward amen for those who couldn't see that just baby steps you're still going forward speak it go forward speak it and go forward speak it and go forward amen when you're in a house fire amen when you come and it starts getting hot amen and and it's uh you know you're getting close to the seat of the fire all of a sudden you don't back up say retreat what do you have with you oh i have a nozzle oh it has lots of water you get in closer your low crawl it sometimes your ears burn and you you can feel it burning through your turnouts but you you're not afraid why is it you have revelation of your turnout gear you have revelation of your air pack you have revelation of the nozzle you have revelation that the engineer is going to give you water and so you come in there and you say what can the fire do to me hallelujah what can 2020 due to you nothing oh hallelujah praise the lord amen hallelujah see if you want to move the word off the page do it surrender your life just that's that's why you you comb through that's why you take communion calm to your life okay i'm all good i'm in the line of duty sometimes you're in the line of duty and here goes and what was that for but god's testing you you say okay did i do something not do something what's wrong okay it's good it's the devil okay it's the devil onward christian soldiers amen see this we have to get our big boy pants on we have to get our bride dress on amen you don't realize the victory that you possess hallelujah amen and so they they couldn't put the the word or the ark into into manifestation because they didn't know it they didn't believe it but the bride in this day she recognizes it and she puts her husband to work you say honey i got this big honey-do list and jesus christ goes glory finally she wants to put me to work hallelujah i know i'm a little strange maybe a lot but that's the way i have to be see you know what god wants he wants his people to fight he wants his people to take his word and fight for every inch of ground he wants he wants us to say husband i'm in a battle come and deliver me he goes yes amen he wants to give you peace hallelujah you're not designed for fear you're not designed for depression amen and so don't go looking up on the internet all about these stupid little maladies and i'm not saying that lightly because you're going to see my some testimonies the more you feed what that demon is the less vic it's going to take longer hallelujah you have atomic hallelujah and so god he wants to protect you he wants you to be at peace he wants you to serve him with joy unspeakable and full of joy but see eli he didn't have that revelation but that's why a samuel came on the scene and so god never took his word away from israel did he he never took his presence was there all the time amen and he was just as powerful as when he opened the red sea amen but he had to bring the belief to an end the unbelief to an end and and as your pastor and all of us around we're preaching and belief and we're bringing the unbelief to an end this is no longer message theology this is no longer what the pastor thinks well i think amen no amen the pastor knows that he knows that he knows and god is saying it's time that unbelief is terminated hallelujah so he rose up with samuel and samuel released the word into its proper position the the fivefold ministry that's called releases the word into the proper position jesus said receive the holy spirit brother braham said that that is the same thing as when you have hands laid upon you to receive your healing it's a foreshadow of what is coming hallelujah and so samuel was raised up to release the word into the proper position and to show the people that jehovah god was still victorious and they were still overcomers amen glory to god hallelujah amen and it's it's been released today god released his word amen he revealed it and so why are we bumping around amen like brother or jewel says wowsy wellesley woo him in a message church no amen he is the same yesterday today and forever what has happened good men in the pulpit are dilatory and they're they're they're preaching a lethargic message i'm sorry i'm going to offend somebody because they say well who are you you're nothing exactly but i know who i am so i challenge you to prove me wrong because it's not me it's his word just like you your life challenges people to prove you wrong and they can't do it amen because you're not dilatory you're not lazy you're up and about your father's business and you're reproducing sheep amen with your life praise the lord jesus and so the word to joshua is what the ministry today should be spreading to the people amen deuteronomy 31 3-8 the lord thy god he will go over before thee that's you he goes before you and he will destroy these nations from before thee and thou shalt possess them every word in that bible is yours and joshua he shall go over before thee as the lord hath said and the lord shall do unto them as he did unto cehan and og do you realize that cehan's bed was 27 feet long read it and unto the land of them whom he destroyed and the lord shall give them up before thy face and they that they may that ye may do unto them according to all the commandments which i have commanded you be strong and of good courage fear not nor be afraid of them for the lord thy god he it is that doth go with thee you're not in this alone today he will not fail thee nor forsake thee and moses called unto joshua and said unto them in the sight of all israel be strong enough good courage for thou must go with the people unto the land which the lord hath sworn unto their fathers to give them and thou shalt cause them to inherit it and the lord he it is that death go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail they neither forsake they fear not neither be dismayed amen what are you worrying about nothing nothing hallelujah praise the lord jesus amen but see we there's seed that still has to come amen there's people that still need to hear the foolishness of the gospel to bring the water upon the seed to bring it to life amen hallelujah there's still people that need to inherit eternal life hallelujah and so we we know that that the holy ghost is it's here to do that for us praise the lord amen and so this generation uh that's why we focus on the on the younger people because us older ones we we know what god has said but the newer ones they need to see god in skin sometimes and and i'm not saying about remember we're not talking so much about signs and wonders and miracles i'm talking about god in skin delivering you from disease from attitude from from all of these things from lost amen and greed and all of that amen hallelujah praise the lord the holy ghost is here the prophet of the hour uh you misspoke that's brother branham no brother brown says the holy ghost the prophet of the hour did he say it or not praise the lord he's looking the holy ghost is looking for vessels who will allow him to nest in their heart amen hallelujah praise god amen i'm gonna have to skip some of this but we know that romans 10 14 and 15 says how they how should they call in him and whom they do they don't believe and these are good people how should they believe in him whom they have not heard and how should they they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent that is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and breed glad tidings and of good things amen it's no more stories this is not story hour this is bride hour this is god in living word hour this is what he's doing right now amen praise the lord jesus amen and amen this is about this is about the ministry bringing the living soul outward of god amen praise god hallelujah and we'll go into these testimonies now throughout all the last year he has been molding me into rest amen hallelujah do you realize that fox news is not the news channel of the bride do you realize that donald trump though he did some good things he's a philanderer he's not a nice man and last time i checked the lord of chaos is not in control god is i i'm he's brought me to a rest and guess what those who have a retirement that could be gone tomorrow i'm at rest hallelujah and so i am at more peace and more rest than at any other time in my life praise the lord you're saying through all of that absolutely because it's taught me about the spoken word it is awesome and that's because god is still god that's because the anointed word is still the anointed word and so i know some of you know about this but but i was having trouble and thought i had an infection in my kidneys and leg and and brother tom sister barbara out there we're building a a rock kind of retaining area on our property and and i'm just oh man you know i'm wore out and and i uh after they left i i went to bed and i laid down and i i really felt like i was dying and so when you feel that you tend to pop right back up it's just like whoa what was that and so i come out i said we need to pray and so we prayed and trying to decide what to do and and so i you know we've seen a lot of miracles and we've been healed a lot and you know that's that's just part of us and i went to the hospital that's not unbelief hallelujah and when i got there then charity began to uh text everybody and and one of the brothers sent me a i thought it was a prophecy but it was a scripture but it was it was for me amen and i started feeling better before they did anything and they didn't really they gave me one pill they did find that i had blood clots plural in my lungs and she almost sent me home because i was ready to go sure let's go you know she goes uh let's give you a a ct and so so i had that but you know what confession lord i'm searching my life is there anything in there amen make things right but also if it was just a mental concept of god i wouldn't be here but something inside kept quoting the word the word the word and so i i went i was back in the pulpit preaching that that this happened saturday i was back in the pulpit on wednesday and and and so i'm creating an atmosphere i'm not denying anything but i'm creating an atmosphere and so i tell you that four nights and anybody i can sympathize with you because or empathize is those four nights were the worst i've ever experienced in my whole life have you ever felt like you were naked and setting up on a windy cliff and no one's with you and you can't cry out to a doctor or a psychologist or a prophet because they're not there but the devil is there and he was so real but what did i have the word it is written my mouth hurt it was so tired because it is written it is this it is this it is that four nights it was terrible my wife it wasn't for her praying us together but where could i run to you know who could my favorite minister what they what could they do for me nothing amen but i i kept and it was i tell you you talk about the greatest battle ever fought that's what it was and so for four nights and finally the last night i just said lord i believe you and i i accept my healing in the name of jesus and i was downstairs and that thing just lifted amen hallelujah praise the lord amen and then saturday i got a kidney stone it's like really and so it was i was i'm glad there wasn't a video but i'm rolling around the floor and making all sorts of noises and and so finally charity goes what do you want me to do i said go ahead call 9-1-1 so she helped me out to the ambulance and i get to the hospital and they do the cat scan and it's like five millimeters not centimeters five millimeters and he goes yeah you'll pass it maybe four days to two weeks and so they you know doped me up and sent me home and so i was praying the next day and i said lord we're going on this trip that's when we came out here and i said lord my desire is that you pass this stone before we get on that plane so we're that day we're flying out to ohio and that feeling came back and we're almost to the airport and if you've had stones say man uh that night i said i told i said people we're not gonna make it to the airport unless you pray and they they laid hands upon me and that thing started to go away well we got to our gate and i said well i'm going to go the restroom one more time i don't mean to be graphic but i'm just saying i went to the restaurant one more time and i i didn't want to be weird i'm in the bathroom and you know you're going oh praise the lord you know but i'm looking and it's like i got i i'll admit it i got the light on my phone and turned it on it's like that is that stone and i come out to them i said i just think i passed that stone and she goes well you spoke it amen see but i have other i have other examples of that so that's not a coincidence amen but it's it's it's little and does it happen all the time when we have a need it's just like god i speak that my lawn is going to be one one length no amen it's when you have a need praise the lord and so recently just before we came out here the medication that i'm on it's a blood thinner and and when i go home i get to get off of it praise god and so and i've been normal i feel great but this this medication speeds your heart up and so i'm laying there for about two weeks and it's just and it's like somebody has a big drum inside my bedroom and uh and then the devil's going oh yeah you're paramedic you know what that's gonna do you're gonna throw a clot or you're going to have a heart attack because your heart's beating so fast oh you know he's right there and and that spirit was coming back again the devil's not going to give up but he's defeated and so one night about uh two weeks ago i i just went down to the basement and i got on my knees and i cried out i said lord i said i believe i receive i am healed and i'm not gonna go back on on what your word says i thank you lord jesus and lord i just want to be normal wednesday night the week later wednesday night church we're preaching away and i'm done it's like oh i feel pretty good thank you lord good anointing you know how it is and we're on the way home and it's like i feel pretty good i go to bed i go right to sleep wake up i feel pretty good he sovereignly delivered me of that amen and so can you see why i am so happy amen can you see why why he has he's done something personally amen in my life to where i know that when i when i pray that he hears and that no matter the time frame he sets me free and now i can empathize with people who have been in depression and to tell them that he has delivered amen amen whatever condition you're in he has delivered hallelujah and so what is god teaching the bride for the day that he's he is here he is the anointed word and it is there's a reality in the spoken word which is the original seed amen glory to god amen musicians you better come because i'm going to keep going i'm sorry but i want to tell you he is here amen it says in psalm 44 5 though we will through thee will we push down our enemies through thy name we will tread them under the under that rise up against us hallelujah through 108 13 through god we shall do valiantly for he it is that shall tread down our enemies we are blessed i'm looking at a people that are blessed beyond their comprehension amen you don't realize how fortunate you are to have ministry that just wants to stay with the word it's not common amen but it will give you life amen it may be hard sometimes but it will give you life amen it's but we've got to keep feeding on it and feeding on and let the digestion of the holy ghost put it into our limbs and let it manifest amen hallelujah praise the lord it's the devil's job to buffet us but greater is he that is in you than he that is in this world amen hallelujah brother chad you better come up we'll finish this another year hallelujah god is good i i hope this was encouraging amen hallelujah and i i pray that we have more of an affinity and a love affair for the word because it's real amen he will never leave you no forsake you amen he he the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and so whatever you have need of he is supplying you brother it's all stand i was encouraged amen one thing i was thinking about the message what i was preaching was there's an encouragement for two things for me an encouragement to surrender and encouragement to believe and i wrote this down right at the end that if we want god to be real how many wants god to be real if we want god to be real then we have to be real so many times we want god to be real but we don't want to have a real confession and a real life that matches the word and a real surrender but if we want a real god then let's be a real believer let's give him our lives and know that we've surrendered that we've given everything to him and everything he reveals to us we repent of it we put it under the blood we make it right so that we can stand with confidence that there's nothing between me and god and there's nothing to hinder the word from coming to pass and then let's do what brother rich encourage us just move forward in the word he said i've surrendered my life i've given god everything he knows i love him he knows i'm being real for him in my perfect note but i'm being real i'm confessing i i'm surrendering i want him to have all of me and because i give him all of me i want to have all of him amen amen i'm encouraged just to believe to believe that i'm his to believe that there's a personal love affair between him and i can you just believe that i believe it's not it's not about whoever is around me i mean they can be included too i have nothing against that but the real love affair is just between me and him he knows me and i know him and i want to know him more and i want more of him and i want him to have more of me and i want to see that life manifest the message didn't come so that we could have books the message didn't come so that we could have doctrine the message came to set us free so that we can live the life he's always called us to live that we could be real believers amen real christians what god always wanted his bride to be the message came to make us that and i say that's what i want to be and i'm not going to wait for everybody else around me i'm going to do my part amen god bless you let's sing blake do you have a song [Music] no matter what circumstance or what i feel or see the word is [Music] [Music] no matter what the circumstance or what i feel brother rich gave us some good instruction tonight if you wanna if you're gonna take god at his word it's not gonna be a five-minute deal because the devil's not bringing a five-minute battle amen but if you're going to take god at his word you got to keep taking in mata's word and you've got to be able to say the word is working mightily in me when you see nothing and feel nothing and nothing seems to be changing but you still know that because of the virtue of his word and the virtue of god that i know that this word will work because he's god and he cannot lie and his word cannot fail it doesn't matter what i see it doesn't matter what i feel what matters is that it's true and it will become a living reality and brother rich was good enough to share his real battle four nights of discouragement four nights of difficulty four might nights of pain and suffering but the word was still working mightily in him and after sticking with the word god never failed the only way the word can fail is if we leave the word and give up on it and run away from it but if we just stick with him god's promised he'll prevail and let's bow our heads and pray and give god's thanksgiving for the word dear heavenly father we thank you lord that you're so mindful of us god i know that if this is the word that you brought brought for us tonight it was because we needed it tonight lord i believe there's somebody many maybe many of us lord we need this encouragement lord we need to remember god that you're the same yesterday today forever and that nothing has changed with you and if we can approach you the same way lord we can get the same results if we can come humbly with faith if we can be repented and surrendered and believing lord embolden our faith lord then we can have the same results that your word has always brought down through history god i pray that there's somebody here that's been discouraged that they would be encouraged now if there's somebody that's been defeated lord that they would no longer walk in defeat but they would stand lord and say the word is working mightily in me though the symptoms haven't gone yet they will go though the circumstances hasn't changed yet it will change because it's in your word and i believe it and i've surrendered everything to you lord and i know that your word will work for me god i pray that you'd help us lord to have a positive confession forgive us for our complaining lord forgive us for our negative confession we want to repent right now and lay that before you lord forgive us for any compromise that's in our life lord and any neglect lord we want to lay that before you but we want to lord be able to say that i've given all to you lord and i know that your word will work for me god i pray to bring deliverance lord there's many needs and in a body of believers there's always so much as we walk through this life we're constantly finding ourselves in need but lord you've already provided everything we need it's already done it's already finished the works were done before the foundation of the world you're just asking us lord to believe and step into it lord help us to believe and move forward by faith while we commit ourselves to you we ask that you bless our brother rich lord and strengthen him god he poured his heart out as you give him leadership to and i thank you for it lord and i pray you would restore his strength and health and give him encouragement lord and let him go home back to his church refreshed and charged up and that he might have some energy lord for his home church bless him and his family while they're traveling lord and while they're here may you bless them abundantly lord god as we surrender ourselves to you i pray you'd pick us up lord and use us for your glory may our confession may our walk may the light that shines through us may it bring glory and honor to your name may you be glorified and because you have an elect seed on the earth that believes you and takes you at your word and that you're able to perform abundantly above all that we could ask or think just because we believe your word god we're trusting in
