[0:00] So the Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost is
[0:03] always about God's spirit upon or in
[0:09] man.
[0:11] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit has got to do with man.
[0:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:16] &gt;&gt; The father is spirit. Yes. What's the
[0:18] difference between father and holy
[0:20] spirit? The holy spirit has got to do
[0:23] with man.
[0:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:26] &gt;&gt; The Jewish Bible uses the word spirit.
[0:28] And you you may have heard this the word
[0:30] ruak. Have you heard that? Which means
[0:33] breath or wind. Do you know the word
[0:36] ghost is in the Old Testament?
[0:39] And Abraham gave up the ghost.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; And that's in the in the Hebrew. It's a
[0:45] completely different to which is spirit.
[0:48] Two separate words. One is ghost, one is
[0:50] spirit. Starts giving us more clues.
[0:53] Right? So in the Greek which is now the
[0:56] new testament they didn't have this word
[0:59] ghost which is English it comes from the
[1:01] German word ghast g a s t which
[1:05] eventually came to be ghost but then
[1:08] what is a ghost
[1:14] &gt;&gt; right? Why would they use the word
[1:16] ghost?
[1:17] &gt;&gt; Apparently ghost is the spirit of
[1:20] someone who has died.
[1:24] which is made visible.
[1:28] &gt;&gt; I saw the spirit. It was a ghost.
[1:32] &gt;&gt; So the spirit is invisible. But when
[1:35] it's visible, it's ghost.
[1:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; They had some reasoning behind what they
[1:41] were writing.
[1:43] &gt;&gt; They were not silly men. I tell you
[1:44] that.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; Right. So it's the same thing, but not
[1:49] the same. There it is. We just have to
[1:52] understand what the meaning was. Right?
[1:54] So, uh, ghast in the old English means a
[1:57] spirit that can physically be seen.
[1:59] Like, well, you know, people will say,
[2:01] "What's the matter with you? You look
[2:02] like you saw a ghost."
[2:04] &gt;&gt; You've heard that.
[2:05] &gt;&gt; You look like you've seen a ghost. Uh,
[2:07] and in the old English, there would be
[2:09] the word apparition.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; You saw something. Something that should
[2:13] have been invisible became visible to
[2:15] you.
[2:17] &gt;&gt; So, basically, it's so simple. It has
[2:20] much more to do with the change in
[2:22] dispensation because what it was showing
[2:25] was that the spirit of God, the spirit
[2:27] of Christ was becoming visible upon the
[2:30] people.
[2:31] &gt;&gt; And they called that the Holy Ghost.
[2:34] &gt;&gt; Because they began to see his spirit
[2:36] becoming visible. How? Because they know
[2:39] what these men were doing was not their
[2:41] own spirit.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43] &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of Christ coming upon
[2:45] them and they called it the ghost.
[2:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the change in dispensation
[2:52] brought forth change in manifestations
[2:54] of the same spirit.
[2:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
