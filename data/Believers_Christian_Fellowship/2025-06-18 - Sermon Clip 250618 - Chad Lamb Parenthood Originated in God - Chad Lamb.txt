TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I told the youth, we were we had a youth meeting and I told some of these the the youth, you if God continues on and allows time to continue and we have a couple more decades on this earth, there's going to be most all of this youth, I bet all of this youth will pass us up in revelation. There'll be young men that come up that can outreach me or any preacher that's ever preached in this pullpit with greater revelation, greater clarity, greater ability. And I want to be the place to fan them on and say, "Go, boy, go. I love it. It's great. I never saw that before. But thank God he brought it through you. Not to put them under thumb and say, "Well, you didn't get that from me and you didn't get learn it from me and I'm the master of every Come on. That's horrible." Amen. We want everybody to grow and reach their full potential. Amen. We want every life to reach its full potential. And the church, yes, we're supposed to be nurturing and loving and caregiving and create an environment. That's what mom does. She she creates an environment at home. Everybody wants to come home to mom's house. At least if you have a healthy relationship with mom and a good mom, everybody wants to come home to mom's house because mom creates that environment. Grand's connected. Mom's loving. But mom also won't let you suffer. It's dad who'll say, "Son, I think you could jump that creek." And mom's like, "No, they can't. son, let me help you build the ramp for your bike. I think you can go a little higher. And mom's like, "No, no, no, no, no. What are you doing?" And say, "Shh, it's going to be okay." Cuz dad knows that boy's got to overcome. He's got to meet challenges. He's got to be willing to take a risk. But what if he falls down and hurts himself? What if he falls down and hurts himself? You know, God will stand and watch you fall down and hurt yourself. That's right. Yes, sir. But the church never will. That's right. The church never will. Amen. If you fall down and hurt yourself, guess what? You're going to have five or six people show up at the hospital and say, "Oh, brother, I'm so sorry. What happened to you? Let's pray together. Here's a basket of flowers. Here's a bunch of candy and chocolates." Cuz the church is a mother role. And we should do that. We shouldn't ever be any different than that. Amen. But God's the one who says, "Hey, stand back for a minute. This is my boy. I want to see if he can make the jump." Amen. That's why healthy, well-balanced children come out of a home with a mother and a father. And I believe healthy, well-balanced Christians come from a place where they've got the love and nurture and and affection of a of a church, a stable church that gather around them and love them and care for them. But they also are constantly pointed to the son, to the father. But father says, but father says, but father says, but father says. And if we don't know, let's ask father. Yeah.
