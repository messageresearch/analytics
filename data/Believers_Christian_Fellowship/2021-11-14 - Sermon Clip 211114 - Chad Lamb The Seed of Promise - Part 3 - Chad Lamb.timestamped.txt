[0:00] and so now he's talking about the great
[0:02] plan that god had one thing he wanted to
[0:04] achieve one goal that he had and
[0:06] everything in the bible has been
[0:07] pointing to this one achievement and so
[0:09] now the lamb's book of life is opened by
[0:12] the lamb he's the only one that's worthy
[0:14] the opening he's the only one that can
[0:16] open it and john when he sees the cry
[0:18] come at the end of time after the church
[0:20] ages he hears a cry says who will come
[0:23] and open the book and nobody's found
[0:25] worthy and john begins to weep because
[0:27] john realizes if nobody's worthy
[0:30] everything in that book is lost
[0:34] and john knew he was in that book and
[0:37] john realizes everything all of creation
[0:40] and everything in that book is lost if
[0:41] nobody can come and take full take take
[0:43] the book amen that's why you and i and
[0:45] we stand here at the end of time amen
[0:48] the seventh angel's already been here
[0:49] he's already come and gone and this book
[0:51] has to be open and the seals have to be
[0:53] revealed at the time of that seventh
[0:55] angel and if that book was not open and
[0:57] christ did not come down with the open
[0:59] book during the life of william branham
[1:01] amen then everything is lost
[1:07] it is our only hope amen but this is why
[1:10] we shouldn't be weeping like john amen
[1:13] because we saw him come forth and take
[1:15] the book and open the seals and we
[1:17] understood it one night after another
[1:19] after another after another when he
[1:20] would come and bring the revelation to
[1:22] those seals what was it the lamb opening
[1:24] the book what was opening the book
[1:26] revealing the seals what was revealing
[1:29] the seals revealing christ
[1:33] amen and because of that we should be
[1:36] like john amen all heaven and all on
[1:39] earth and all under there heard me
[1:41] rejoicing amen saying i worthy and honor
[1:44] and praise be unto him that sitteth on
[1:46] the throne
[1:49] he come and he took the book amen so
[1:52] when he took the book brother bam uses
[1:54] all kinds of terminology he tore off the
[1:55] seals he threw him down to the seventh
[1:57] church take the mister he gave him to
[1:58] the to the to the bride to the church uh
[2:00] he come down with open book in his hand
[2:02] there's all ways to describe this but
[2:04] it's all one in the self same thing amen
[2:06] if you get the open book you get christ
[2:13] if there's no more seals on the book
[2:16] then christ is here in full measure
[2:19] what was keeping christ from the people
[2:21] what was keeping christ from the people
[2:23] was the denominational change that had
[2:25] the holy ghost bound for nearly two
[2:27] thousand years but in the evening time
[2:29] is loose by the evening time message the
[2:31] holy ghost back in the people again
[2:35] what's the holy ghost the life of that
[2:36] word
[2:38] the life that was in christ amen now
[2:41] coming back into the church when's it
[2:42] coming back into the church at the
[2:44] opening of the seals because at the
[2:46] opening of the seals is the fullness of
[2:48] christ unveiled hear presence
