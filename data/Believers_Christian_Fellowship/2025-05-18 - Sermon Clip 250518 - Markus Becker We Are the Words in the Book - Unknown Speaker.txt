========================================

So you must understand now here's Jesus and remember what happens to him will happen to the bride the same way. Amen. Wherever it's written of Christ you must see the bride is part of Christ and he sits in the temple and he opens the book and what does he do? He finds himself. He finds himself. He said it is written of me. Okay. So when when when when when he finds himself in that way, he closed the book. He said, "The whole book is written of me." Praise God. Brother, you come to a place in your time where you find your name in the book. I've seen people healed and I know there is a there is a there's a question of our mind and so forth and we have to deal with it. Amen. Amen. People consist of body, soul, and spirit. You have there's healing for all three of them. Amen. But the healing of the soul in reality is the revelation of who you are. Amen. Amen. And then we have healing. Brother William said God has many ways to heal. He heals by love. He leads by surgery. He heals by by by understanding. Okay. Amen. So please understand the way the time comes when you find yourself in the book. God allows it. You need it in order to go home. Now here's brother Brandon. Okay. Memphis, Tennessee. The plane is not uh is there is a there is a storm. He hears the voice go and he just goes and here is that mama and I just call it mama just okay. Brother said she hangs over the fence. Yeah. Okay. And brother Brandon passes by and she she says hello parson. Yeah. Amen. He says how do you know that I'm a minister? Look God is in humor. Amen. Normally it was brother Brandon revealing the people. Your name is Eva. I see you in a car accident. But that woman is now revealing brother Brennan. She He does not know who she is, but she knows who he is. Understand? Amen. Amen. You're the prophet Elijah and I'm the Shunomite woman. But I tell you one thing, to find Brother Benham in the Bible, it's not very difficult. But you must find yourself. She did not only say this is brother Brandham, you are the prophet Elijah. He said you are the prophet Elijah and I am. Amen. That's all. Therefore, you read the book of Esther. He said, "That's me." Esther had no father and she had no mother. Types Melchazedc. Esther had two names. One was the American name. The other one was her eternal name. Eternal identification. Can you say amen? Blessed be the name. And that's the love of the father. Amen. That is God revealing himself to us. So we understand at the end of our life, I'm not the son of Charles and Ala Brrenham. No, no. I am I come from God and I go back to God. This message really revealed our identity.
