[0:00] the love of God didn't make the Hornets
[0:03] an enemy
[0:06] they didn't make the Hornet something to
[0:07] be hated they made the Hornet something
[0:09] to be sympathized with and pitied and
[0:12] loved
[0:15] my goodness this is Light Years Beyond
[0:17] human
[0:19] this is not human amen this is not our
[0:21] efforts this is not us trying to be
[0:23] loving you can try to be loving all you
[0:26] want amen but at some point it's going
[0:28] to break it's going to fizzle amen your
[0:30] love the human love is not strong enough
[0:32] to handle some of these circumstances
[0:33] but oh praise God something changed
[0:36] something happened in a moment's time
[0:38] the whole atmosphere Chained and brother
[0:40] Ben instead of being angry and afraid he
[0:42] was loving and had sympathy and began to
[0:44] apologize to Hornets
[0:47] apologize to a bull
[0:51] I say God that's the love that I need
[0:55] but that's the power that I believe is
[0:58] shed abroad in our hearts but I believe
[1:00] it's there but listen what brought love
[1:03] to the Forefront it was the obstacle
[1:05] that brought love to the Forefront
[1:08] what was it that displayed the love of
[1:10] God it was the need for the love of God
[1:13] it was the great adversity that produced
[1:16] the great love
[1:18] we think of all these trials and these
[1:20] Temptations and the difficult things we
[1:22] go through we look at them as bad things
[1:24] they're not bad things they're good
[1:25] things friends we absolutely need them
[1:27] amen because the promises are to them
[1:29] that overcometh how will you read how
[1:31] will you receive the promise if you
[1:33] don't overcome how will you overcome
[1:35] with no trial
[1:37] and then how will the love of God be
[1:39] expressed amen if your human love is
[1:42] enough to carry you through every
[1:43] circumstance and you can retain your
[1:45] emotions and you can hold back your fear
[1:47] and all of these things you can do
[1:49] yourself how will the love of God ever
[1:51] be expressed no I'm telling your friends
[1:53] the love of God will be expressed when
[1:54] we've gone beyond human amen beyond the
[1:57] ability when the situation is so serious
[1:59] and so intense and so fearful and so
[2:02] dangerous amen that there's no way a
[2:04] human being can endure that's when
[2:07] something will happen
[2:09] [Music]
[2:12] I wonder many times that that's why
[2:13] brother Branham says you wait till this
[2:15] Council Begins the title you wait for
[2:17] these things then you'll see what you've
[2:18] seen temporarily manifest in fullness of
[2:20] power not because human beings are going
[2:23] to be able to do it but because the
[2:24] circumstance will get to the situation
[2:26] where nothing else can do but the the
[2:29] but the perfect love of God producing
[2:31] the third pool
[2:33] not a human brain not human emotions not
[2:36] we finally got ourselves to Perfection
[2:38] we will never get ourselves to
[2:40] Perfection it'll be the love of God
[2:42] being perfected within us
[2:46] and we've seen it here it's been
[2:48] displayed to us amen and and I thank God
[2:52] now that we know we don't have to
[2:54] produce him we don't have to fake
[2:56] anything we don't have to work anything
[2:57] up we don't have to keep trying and
[2:59] trying and trying there's no trying to
[3:01] produce this amen the only thing we're
[3:03] trying to do is surrender more surrender
[3:05] more surrender more so that he can take
[3:08] a greater portion of me and feed more on
[3:11] the word and stay in the washing of the
[3:13] water of the word so that it can get
[3:15] more of me out of me so in times of
[3:17] trouble there's something planted deep
[3:19] within me that could come to the
[3:21] Forefront
[3:23] I can't produce this all I can do is
[3:25] open myself up and say God I need more
[3:27] of you
[3:29] I need you to lead me further into your
[3:31] love
