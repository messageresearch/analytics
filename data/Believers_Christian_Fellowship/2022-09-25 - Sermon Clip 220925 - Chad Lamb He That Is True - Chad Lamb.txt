TRANSCRIPT
========================================
what makes us a real bride because the true one he that is true has taken up residence in his body on Earth at the opening of the seals when the veil was taken away from the word and the Mystery of God was given to the bride it unlocked amen and Unbound and Unchained the Holy Ghost to come back into the church what Chained and limited the Holy Ghost partial word rejection of word refusing of God's word amen it was a chain that was binding amen it was limiting access to the Church of the Church of the Living God to the full measure of the Living God it was it was cut off amen by limited word when the word come back it broke the chains off and all the resistance and now the Holy Ghost is come back into the church again and what makes us a real bride is not because I stand up and say I'm part of the real bride but what makes me a real bride is the real bridegroom is in me amen the real bridegroom in you makes you the real bride what makes you true a True Heart A True Believer a true worshiper it's when the truth himself has come into you and living out of you it's not what we've done it's what Christ has done amen we we could never even come to God and Jesus says no man cometh to me lest the father draweth him first amen we can never come unless we were predestinated for known of God and destined to come and God had planted a seed of eternal life down inside of us something he could Quicken with the word in the day and we quit Quicken with his spirit amen and we have come because there's a peace of God on the inside that has the potential to live the life of God what makes us a true bride is because the true one has identified you before the foundation of the world to be a true expression of Bride not because we claim to be not because we line up our doctors not because we say I can cross the t's and Dot the eyes I must have I must come from him I must have his life quickening that seed inside of me it's got to be him in me making me a true bride if not I will be a semblance of a bride I will be a picture or a tie or a foreshadow and I don't want to be this generation foreshadowing a true bride that will come I want to be the true bride amen I want to be surrendered completely to him so that he can have free reign in me and live the full expression of what he always wanted in his bride it can't be me it must be him in me
