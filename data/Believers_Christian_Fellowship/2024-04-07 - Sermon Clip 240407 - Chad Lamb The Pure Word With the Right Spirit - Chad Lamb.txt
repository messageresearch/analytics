TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it's speaking the truth in love it's speaking the truth with the very motive of God in giving the word because God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever should believeth in him shall not be condemned but have everlasting life amen is that what he said the next verse he sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but the world through him might be saved amen amen so what was his motive in sending Jesus Christ his motive was love and his motive was salvation when somebody rejected that they're already condemned they're condemned already because they receive not the Son of God they're already condemned he didn't send the son to condemn the world they were already condemned by the Fall In the Garden of Eden he sent the son into the world for salvation love sent Jesus Christ he was an expression of God's love Jesus died motivated by love so now how should I administer this message with the same motive that God gave it how should I administer the scriptures with the same motive God gave it amen how should I witness I should witness to others with the same motivation behind me that motivated God to send Jesus Christ into the world that they might be saved but I I have failed so many times in witnessing because many times in witnessing I was using the word to condemn somebody else and to vindicate myself as knowing what the Bible said and being right and somehow being holy and you're not holy and you're wrong and you're condemned and I used the wrong motive with the word the word was pure but my heart was evil I wanted to prove I was right and they were wrong is that why Jesus that is that why Jesus came into the world is that why God sent his son is that why God gave us a message is that why he gave a love letter to the bride will there be judgment absolutely anytime you spurn Mercy there's judgment Mercy's been Stern but that wasn't the purpose the world was already in judgment he didn't have to send it for judgment he sent it for mercy and when they spurn Mercy there's nothing left but judgment amen so in witnessing my motive now needs to be love it needs I say God put a love in my heart and honestly I'm to the point where if God doesn't give me a supernatural Love and Desire for a person I better shut my mouth and not say anything to them because I need the right motivation with the word to get the right results and if they if they spurn Mercy then that's between them and God but my motive has to be love and salvation and and because there's a soul at stake and that's got to be my whole Vision not whether I'm right or wrong I can prove it by the Bible and show you that I know something and I'm righteous and you're not that's all got to die and we got to go back to a basic love of souls amen a basic desire to say there's a way out of this trap friend there's a way of Salvation there's an assurance amen you can have what God has given in this day because of love and a desire for Souls not for condemnation self- glorification envy and strive
