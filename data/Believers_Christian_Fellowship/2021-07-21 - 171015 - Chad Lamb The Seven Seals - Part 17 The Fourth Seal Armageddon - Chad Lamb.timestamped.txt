[0:01] we're going to read revelations
[0:03] out of revelation 16.
[0:10] amen also wanted to announce that we're
[0:12] going to have a
[0:14] youth meeting this friday night is our
[0:16] regularly scheduled youth meeting but
[0:18] we're gonna have it at brother paul and
[0:19] sister jenny priest's house they're
[0:20] gonna have a bonfire
[0:22] some food and maybe a hay ride and it's
[0:25] open to all the area youth we've invited
[0:27] the other churches
[0:28] and uh brother jonathan martin is
[0:30] actually going to be ministering for us
[0:32] there so
[0:33] that's exciting we're looking forward to
[0:34] that uh
[0:36] so god bless you and also remember the
[0:38] politcarian today after service
[0:40] we'd love for you all to stay and have
[0:42] fellowship those are our favorite times
[0:44] is when we can spend
[0:45] all day together amen god bless you
[0:48] let's read this together
[0:51] starting in verse 12 we're going to read
[0:53] about the sixth vial
[0:55] in chapter 16 verse 12. and the sixth
[0:58] angel poured out his vial upon the great
[1:00] river euphrates and the water thereof
[1:02] was dried up
[1:03] that the way of the kings of the east
[1:05] might be prepared
[1:07] and i saw three unclean spirits like
[1:08] frogs come out of the mouth of the
[1:10] dragon and out of the mouth of the beast
[1:12] and out of the mouth of the false
[1:14] prophet for they are the spirits of
[1:16] devils working miracles which go forth
[1:18] unto the kings of the earth
[1:19] and of the whole world to gather them to
[1:21] the battle of the great day of god
[1:24] almighty
[1:25] men see we have three unclean spirits
[1:27] like frogs
[1:28] and we know this is a trinity doctrine
[1:31] and we know that when
[1:32] when the false false religion began
[1:35] through the tower of babel through
[1:37] nimrod and all of that it went
[1:39] very quickly to a three god system amen
[1:42] most of the false religion has a mult
[1:44] multiple gods
[1:45] and it moved into the christian church
[1:47] when pagan rome
[1:48] adapted to christianity and blended the
[1:50] two the false religion with the true
[1:52] religion and so we see what a filthy
[1:55] thing this is and what a terrible thing
[1:57] it is
[1:57] it's not just a difference of opinion
[1:59] about the godhead
[2:01] it's not just a different way of
[2:03] thinking it's not like everything's okay
[2:04] we think this way you think this way but
[2:06] we all love god
[2:07] these are three unclean spirits like
[2:09] frogs amen
[2:11] and they are the spirits of devils
[2:13] working miracles which go forth unto the
[2:15] kings of the earth
[2:16] and of the whole world to gather them to
[2:18] the battle
[2:19] that great day of god almighty
[2:23] why is the trinity doctrine become such
[2:25] a separation point
[2:27] why is it people will go along with you
[2:29] on so many things and you can be
[2:31] christians and you can have fellowship
[2:32] for so long
[2:33] but as soon as you touch the trinity
[2:35] doctrine you're cut off
[2:38] because it's the thing that is gathering
[2:40] the whole world to the battle of the
[2:42] great day of god almighty
[2:45] verse 15 behold i come as a thief
[2:47] blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth
[2:49] his garments lest he walk
[2:51] naked and they see his shame and he
[2:53] gathered them together into a place
[2:55] called in the hebrew tongue armageddon
[2:58] let's bow our heads together
[3:01] dear heavenly father we thank you for
[3:03] this day and for this opportunity we
[3:05] have
[3:05] to hear your word preach lord and i just
[3:08] pray that you would take the vessel
[3:09] that you would move it to the side that
[3:11] i could just relax lord and you would
[3:13] come in and feed your sheep
[3:14] like you so faithfully do you've
[3:16] promised to do it lord and we're just
[3:18] expecting now to hear from you
[3:20] i pray that you break your word to us
[3:22] lord that we might feed upon the fresh
[3:23] manna from heaven
[3:24] in jesus christ's name we pray amen you
[3:28] all can be seated
[3:29] praise the lord we've got i've got a lot
[3:33] on my
[3:34] on my heart today and this is i think
[3:37] if i'm not wrong this is the seventh
[3:39] message on the fourth seal
[3:41] and when we started you know we started
[3:43] going down the line and i thought you
[3:45] know we're going to crank through these
[3:46] and
[3:47] and but you know we read that quote
[3:49] several times when brother branham said
[3:50] you could stop on each one of these
[3:52] seals and
[3:52] preach a whole month of sermons each
[3:54] night on just one of them
[3:56] he said they go all the way through the
[3:57] scripture all the way back from the back
[3:59] all the way
[4:00] through the scriptures each of these
[4:01] seals does and we're beginning to see
[4:03] that that's true
[4:05] i mean not just something that brother
[4:07] branham said this is becoming more and
[4:09] more of a reality to us
[4:11] as god breaks the word to us praise the
[4:14] lord
[4:15] i have been i just want you to know i've
[4:17] been an absolute basket case the last
[4:19] two days three days
[4:20] because the subject is so huge
[4:23] and i thought we're on the seventh part
[4:26] of the fourth seal we'll just wrap it up
[4:29] we'll be done and all sudden it expands
[4:32] and expands you know brother branham
[4:33] said
[4:34] at the end time when at the end of time
[4:36] it's like a roman candle going off it
[4:38] just
[4:38] pops and off of that more pop out and
[4:40] that's the way it is here brothers and
[4:42] sisters it just more comes out and more
[4:44] comes out and more comes out
[4:46] and so i want to talk about armageddon
[4:48] if we could bring up the powerpoint i
[4:49] want to talk about armageddon this
[4:51] morning
[4:52] but i want you to i want to put put on
[4:54] your spiritual jackets this morning
[4:56] and let's really see what the prophet is
[4:58] saying if you'll remember about
[5:00] two months ago brother nestor come along
[5:03] just before camp and he preached on
[5:05] spiritual armageddon how many remembers
[5:07] that
[5:08] well he had got to my subject way before
[5:10] i was ready to get to it
[5:11] but it was exciting because we had just
[5:14] finished on the third seal starting on
[5:15] the fourth seal
[5:16] and brother branham talks about this uh
[5:19] quite a bit in the fourth seal and we're
[5:20] going to look at that
[5:22] because the fourth seal is the wrap-up
[5:24] of everything for the gentile bride it's
[5:26] the wrap-up and finishing
[5:27] of everything for the gentile church and
[5:30] so he speaks about this
[5:31] but i just wanted to take my time
[5:33] getting into it and i've been studying
[5:34] this for a long time
[5:36] so it's a really really big subject
[5:38] we're going to get into a few things
[5:39] that i
[5:40] that i hope will clear some things up
[5:42] for us
[5:44] now do we believe in a physical
[5:45] armageddon where a battle where christ
[5:47] returns with his saints and physically
[5:49] sets up his dominion upon the earth
[5:51] absolutely without a shadow of a doubt
[5:54] we know that
[5:54] it's going to happen but there's also
[5:56] got to be something that takes place
[5:58] spiritually
[6:00] here's a principle that brother lays
[6:02] down our brother branham lays down in
[6:03] the
[6:04] palm worm locust glocus cankerworm and
[6:06] caterpillar
[6:07] you know he preached this subject back
[6:09] in 53 but he picks it up again
[6:11] in the restoration of the bride tree and
[6:12] he touches on it several times through
[6:14] his ministry
[6:15] and he's laying down a pattern or
[6:17] something for us to see here
[6:19] it said during this time of joel's
[6:20] prophecy here the church was in a
[6:22] terrible condition
[6:24] backslid just prior to the coming of the
[6:26] lord the first time
[6:27] and how that the spirit came upon this
[6:29] prophet and he foresaw things
[6:31] and he saw the condition of the jews and
[6:33] he saw the condition of the church in
[6:35] this day
[6:37] now this prophecy of course like other
[6:38] prophecy has a compound meaning
[6:40] a prophecy sometimes has a natural
[6:42] meaning then it has
[6:44] a spiritual meaning so here in joel
[6:47] the fact that brother branham will go
[6:49] back and pick up these four stages of
[6:51] this insect in joel
[6:53] is astonishing because if you read
[6:55] through it and you read through it in
[6:56] the context of what's being written
[6:58] that it's clearly talking about a
[7:01] condition that was happening right then
[7:02] to the jews
[7:04] right he's talking about how how this
[7:07] this
[7:08] insects have come in and they've been
[7:10] been destroying the land
[7:11] and taking what's rightfully israel and
[7:13] he's really talking about a time
[7:16] when under the breakup of the of the
[7:18] grecian empire
[7:19] the king of the north would come down
[7:20] and begin to spoil
[7:22] uh the nation of israel and be begin to
[7:25] destroy them and take them down but god
[7:27] was going to do a restoration work
[7:29] and bring everything back and that
[7:31] literally happened right then at that
[7:33] time
[7:34] and brother branham would go back and he
[7:36] would grab that prophecy
[7:38] amen and he could pull it right to today
[7:40] how is it that brother brenham is able
[7:42] to do that
[7:43] because he saw peter do the exact same
[7:45] thing
[7:46] he looked at peter peter on the day of
[7:48] pentecost he went back to the exact same
[7:50] prophecy
[7:51] that had already been fulfilled in the
[7:53] natural
[7:54] and he pulled it right over to the
[7:56] spiritual
[7:58] and brother branham comes now at the end
[8:01] of the gentile dispensation at the end
[8:03] of the of the bride and he comes down
[8:06] and he takes the same prophecy
[8:09] and he brings it right to today
[8:12] hallelujah only prophets can do that
[8:14] friends
[8:16] so we've got to be careful that when we
[8:17] read the scripture we don't read it and
[8:19] say oh that's finished
[8:21] if we don't read it and say oh that
[8:23] applies to that because once god
[8:25] writes his word his word is eternal
[8:28] that's a principle we cannot forget
[8:29] god's word is eternal
[8:31] and you can't read and say oh that was
[8:33] done when the king from syria came down
[8:35] and he destroyed him and
[8:36] then you had the maccabees rise up and
[8:38] cast them a mountain cleansing of the
[8:40] temple and restoration it's over
[8:42] peter didn't think it was over peter
[8:45] thought it was applicable to his day
[8:48] amen and not only that a vindicated
[8:49] prophet comes in our day and he doesn't
[8:51] think it's over he thinks it's
[8:52] applicable
[8:53] to the church ages
[8:56] see how you cannot use intellectual
[8:58] reasoning to look at the word of god
[9:00] you've got to find god's pattern and
[9:02] god's pattern is to bring
[9:04] a prophet on the scene who's a divine
[9:06] interpreter of the word
[9:08] and when he comes on the scene like
[9:10] peter standing there full of the holy
[9:11] ghost
[9:12] he had every right by the authority of
[9:14] the holy ghost to pull that scripture
[9:15] and put it in his day
[9:18] are we right and brother branham had
[9:20] every right to do the same thing
[9:24] so we have to be careful when we read
[9:26] when we read scripture like we read this
[9:28] in
[9:29] in the sixth vial and and talking about
[9:32] what's happening here
[9:33] we have to be careful when we read this
[9:35] we don't say oh that's
[9:36] only in the future that's only going to
[9:38] happen in a physical
[9:41] got to be very very careful so we see
[9:44] brother branham leaves us shows us this
[9:47] principle and it's and it's manifest
[9:49] through the scriptures
[9:50] it's very clearly done paul does the
[9:52] same exact thing
[9:53] jesus does the same exact thing they'll
[9:56] take prophecies
[9:57] they'll take things that have already
[9:58] happened things that have happened to
[10:00] the nation
[10:00] things that had happened to david
[10:02] himself and it actually physically
[10:04] happened to david in david's lifetime
[10:06] but jesus would pick it up and say it
[10:08] was about me
[10:10] but it was about david but david was
[10:12] just foreshadowing something else to
[10:14] come
[10:14] but but jesus not every man could pick
[10:17] that up and say
[10:18] that works here and that works there but
[10:19] jesus was the prophet amen
[10:22] he was the great prophet so he could
[10:24] pick it up and he could apply it right
[10:25] to today
[10:27] hallelujah no doubt some of the jews
[10:29] were there and say you're taking that
[10:31] out of context that was already
[10:32] fulfilled
[10:33] and that was david that wasn't talking
[10:35] about you amen but he had every right to
[10:37] do that
[10:39] hallelujah
[10:43] so we've been following two vines
[10:47] and as we go through here i'd like to
[10:48] take a step back
[10:50] review and go forward again take a step
[10:52] back and go forward
[10:53] because we don't want to lose our place
[10:55] amen
[10:57] it says in the greatest battle ever
[10:58] fought this great first battle that was
[11:01] ever fought began in heaven
[11:02] when michael and his angels fought
[11:04] against lucifer and his angels
[11:06] it first started the first battle was in
[11:08] heaven so
[11:09] sin did not originate on earth it
[11:11] originated in heaven
[11:13] and then it was thrown down from heaven
[11:14] cast out of heaven to the earth and fell
[11:16] on human beings
[11:18] then the battle from angels became human
[11:20] battles and satan come to destroy god's
[11:22] creation what god had created to be for
[11:24] himself
[11:25] he had satan come to destroy this that's
[11:27] what this purpose was to destroy it
[11:30] then the battle began here on earth and
[11:31] begin in us
[11:33] it has been raging ever since so the
[11:36] battle
[11:37] moved from angels became human battles
[11:40] this is really important to note so the
[11:43] battle continued
[11:46] we have that so the battle that started
[11:48] in heaven
[11:49] it didn't end when when lucifer and his
[11:52] angels were cast out
[11:53] because they continued the battle right
[11:55] on earth this isn't a different battle
[11:57] this is the same battle
[12:00] and it's continuing all the way through
[12:02] and now it moved from angels
[12:04] to humans so now who's fighting in the
[12:08] battle
[12:10] amen if we don't realize what our
[12:12] purpose here on earth
[12:13] your purpose here is as a soldier amen
[12:16] your purpose is not
[12:17] here to to raise your family and and to
[12:20] have a job and
[12:21] to see what kind of goods you can
[12:23] accumulate while you're on this earth
[12:25] all of those things will happen you have
[12:26] to live a natural life that's the way
[12:28] god's designed it
[12:29] but that's not the purpose of life your
[12:31] purpose of life is to come
[12:33] and fight this battle and overcome the
[12:35] devil
[12:36] that's why you're placed on this earth
[12:38] and that's why you're placed in the
[12:40] laodicea
[12:41] is to fight this battle the devil
[12:43] doesn't want you to realize it's a
[12:45] battle
[12:46] that's why he's made laodicea look so
[12:48] much
[12:49] like there's no warfare going on that
[12:51] everything is
[12:52] easy and everything is peaceful and you
[12:54] got a nice home and you got a nice car
[12:56] and you got plenty of clothes
[12:58] and you got food and you can get a job
[13:00] if you want to get a job
[13:01] and everything's going okay because he
[13:03] doesn't want you to realize that you're
[13:05] actually in a battle
[13:06] and when everything's going okay you're
[13:08] actually losing the battle
[13:11] so this whole system is set up to keep
[13:14] spiritual amnesia going so that we don't
[13:16] know who we
[13:17] are and we don't know what we're here
[13:19] for and we're not actually
[13:20] fighting back we're just going with the
[13:22] pied piper
[13:24] right and that's the whole system it's
[13:26] what it's set up for
[13:27] that's why you know work becomes
[13:29] all-consuming part of life and
[13:31] and then we we get all of these things
[13:33] where we have to start running our kids
[13:35] all to all these activities and now
[13:37] the family split up and we're running to
[13:40] this activity and this activity and
[13:42] work is a consuming part of dad's life
[13:44] work is a consuming part of mom's life
[13:46] and we just work on work and work and
[13:48] run and run and run until at the end of
[13:49] the day we collapse in bed
[13:51] and if we're lucky we'll get up in time
[13:52] to go to church on sunday
[13:55] that's satan's eden that's what devil's
[13:57] trying to do because he doesn't want to
[13:59] lose this battle he wants to win
[14:03] and the battle moved from angels to
[14:06] humans
[14:07] we've got that so it's not as if we can
[14:10] wait for somebody else to pick up the
[14:12] battle and fight
[14:13] there is nobody else you're the one
[14:15] who's placed here
[14:17] in this period of time to defeat the
[14:19] devil in this age
[14:21] in satan's eden at the end of laodicea
[14:23] this is where you're at
[14:26] so there's no putting it off on somebody
[14:28] else and if you
[14:29] if if we're missing our obligation and
[14:32] missing our
[14:33] our duty then then the whole thing is
[14:35] still
[14:36] failing the whole the whole battle is
[14:40] still
[14:40] falling into lucifer's hands it fell
[14:43] into his hands in heaven
[14:44] there was a rebellion there was sin then
[14:47] he was cast out
[14:48] then he fell and it fell into again in
[14:51] eden
[14:51] then it fell to the hebrew church then
[14:53] it fell to the gentile church
[14:55] remember it's been falling his way ever
[14:58] so long
[15:00] but there's going to come a time there's
[15:02] going to be a people who wake up out of
[15:04] spiritual amnesia
[15:05] and realize what they're on this earth
[15:07] for and begin to fight back
[15:09] and take back what's been taken from
[15:11] them amen and defeat the devil in his
[15:14] own terms
[15:14] on his own ground hallelujah
[15:21] look what this is all coming to this is
[15:23] in the fourth seal now
[15:25] mother branham is talking about the the
[15:27] ecumenical move and
[15:28] talking about denominationalism and how
[15:30] it starts and how it
[15:31] how it goes all over and divide up on
[15:34] different beliefs
[15:35] he says look what is this all coming to
[15:37] what is it
[15:38] it's going right back the way it did it
[15:40] started in heaven
[15:42] it's going it's coming to the end time
[15:44] battle
[15:45] and friends it's coming to the end time
[15:47] battle
[15:49] that's all there is to it amen and as
[15:52] we're coming to an end time battle
[15:54] we have to realize we're not coming
[15:57] oh how do i say this so that we get it
[16:00] we got to get this
[16:01] we're not coming to an end time
[16:04] pleasure life to live easy and smooth
[16:08] and then slip away in a rapture and
[16:10] everything's wonderful
[16:11] we have to first come to the end time
[16:13] battle
[16:14] before we come to the rapture so that we
[16:17] can return
[16:18] back to set up the kingdom
[16:21] hallelujah i just want to say it this
[16:24] way
[16:24] we can look forward to the physical
[16:26] armageddon
[16:27] where christ comes down with his saints
[16:29] and sets up the earthly kingdom restores
[16:32] the the throne of david and the son of
[16:34] david sits on the throne and we rule and
[16:36] reign with him a thousand years
[16:37] that's a wonderful promise to us but it
[16:41] doesn't do us
[16:41] any good to think about that and
[16:43] contemplate on it and miss the battle
[16:45] we're in now because if we don't win
[16:47] this we don't go there
[16:49] we can talk about what's coming and talk
[16:51] about millennial reign
[16:52] and talk about return of the lord with
[16:54] the same talk about defeating the devil
[16:56] when he's incarnate
[16:57] we can talk about all those things but
[16:59] that's all we're doing is talking about
[17:01] it
[17:01] the only way to get there is to win here
[17:05] win here the spiritual war and if we win
[17:08] the spiritual war here
[17:09] we get to go to the physical and set up
[17:11] the kingdom
[17:12] physically in a physical millennium on
[17:14] the earth but when we're cruising along
[17:19] like everything's just as it's always
[17:21] been
[17:21] and there's no battle to fight and
[17:23] nothing going on we're never going to
[17:25] get there
[17:27] amen we have too many times that
[17:32] that the devil just comes in and he
[17:34] deceives so easily
[17:37] keeps us from the right objective and
[17:39] from the real purpose in our lives and
[17:42] we start chasing rainbows and we start
[17:44] chasing butterflies around and we're so
[17:46] distracted
[17:47] and we're missing the real point and the
[17:49] real point is for us to come
[17:51] so that the devil is no longer getting
[17:53] the upper hand on the people of god
[17:55] and the word of god prevails over him
[17:57] and when the word of god prevails over
[17:59] him
[18:00] then we've accomplished our purpose then
[18:01] this battle here is won
[18:03] and then we get to go hallelujah
[18:09] the first thing in heaven was a battle
[18:11] lucifer was kicked out and come to earth
[18:13] then he polluted eden then he's been
[18:15] polluting it ever since
[18:16] and now from the battle in heaven it's
[18:18] come to the battle on earth
[18:19] and it's to be finished on earth at the
[18:21] at the end time in the battle called
[18:23] armageddon
[18:24] now everyone knows that the battle
[18:25] started in heaven
[18:27] and so they kicked them out michael and
[18:29] his angels overthrew them just run out
[18:32] and then they did they dropped right
[18:33] down into eden and here started the
[18:35] battle down here
[18:38] praise god
[18:42] you let me go back i don't want you to
[18:44] read that yet
[18:46] whenever i put something up everybody
[18:48] always reads ahead
[18:51] now you see why you see why
[18:56] the seals had to be broke
[18:59] and spiritual amnesia had to be removed
[19:02] and we had to recognize the plan of
[19:04] redemption and who we are and how we fit
[19:06] in and what's been going on all this
[19:08] time
[19:08] we had to because if we stayed in that
[19:11] sleepy condition
[19:12] then we're going to constantly be
[19:14] deceived by the devil and deceived by
[19:15] the devil but we've got to come to
[19:17] an awakening a realization that we came
[19:20] from god
[19:21] that we go to god what the whole plan on
[19:23] earth is all about
[19:24] what our position is where we're at and
[19:26] what we're supposed to be doing to
[19:27] overcome
[19:30] right because because before that we're
[19:32] just cruising along
[19:33] just doing what we think is right what
[19:35] we think is best trying to do the best
[19:37] that we can
[19:38] but the whole time the devil keeps
[19:40] having victory over the word of god
[19:42] because there's always a letdown
[19:44] somewhere on the word of god so there
[19:45] had to come a time when the word of god
[19:47] would be restored to the people
[19:49] and they would be given a faith to
[19:50] believe that word and when they do
[19:53] now the devil was not going to get
[19:54] victory over that word anymore
[19:57] hallelujah so now you can see why
[20:02] why i just don't know how else to say it
[20:06] but just to say it
[20:09] now you know why a social gospel will
[20:12] never
[20:12] win the battle and now you know why
[20:16] if we just got up here and every day
[20:17] talked about you know be nice to your
[20:19] children
[20:20] and love your wives and husbands and
[20:21] wives be really nice to one another and
[20:24] and you know uh uh you know set up your
[20:26] family and
[20:27] and do nice things and then go out and
[20:29] do some community service and show
[20:30] people the love of christ by being
[20:32] really nice to them
[20:33] you know those things are wonderful and
[20:35] there's nothing wrong with those things
[20:37] but they'll never get you to win this
[20:39] battle
[20:41] and then we'll just keep going on like
[20:42] we are talking about being nice to
[20:44] people and everybody loves jesus and
[20:45] jesus loves everybody
[20:47] but you know why the seals had to come
[20:49] because that gospel will never
[20:51] ever ever win the battle
[20:54] it'll never expose the enemy it'll never
[20:56] expose his battle plan
[20:58] it'll never show his tactics that he
[21:00] come in and defeat the church with
[21:01] all we know we don't know anything we're
[21:03] just cruising along trying our best to
[21:05] be nice to our wife and be nice to our
[21:07] children and be nice to our neighbor
[21:08] and that will never produce what we're
[21:10] supposed to produce in this day
[21:13] that's why brother branham will come
[21:14] along and he will tear down
[21:16] everything
[21:19] tear it completely down and build it
[21:22] back according to the word
[21:24] build back the family according to the
[21:26] word build back the role of a father the
[21:28] role of a mother amen build back the
[21:30] structure of a church and the gifts of
[21:32] the body
[21:33] and the administration of the of the of
[21:35] the ministry he built it all back
[21:37] according to the word
[21:38] amen because the word has to be restored
[21:40] in order for satan to be defeated
[21:44] hallelujah you know there's
[21:48] i'm off on a tangent
[21:52] because nothing else but this message
[21:54] will work
[21:57] there are more there are more
[22:01] family christian family counselors and
[22:04] books and
[22:05] and there's bookstores laden i mean
[22:08] racks
[22:08] and racks and racks of christian
[22:10] material
[22:12] trying to get the christian people to
[22:14] act like christians
[22:17] racks of it racks of it how to have a
[22:20] family and guard against divorce in your
[22:22] marriage and
[22:24] and they have the same problem year
[22:26] after year
[22:27] generation after generation it keeps
[22:29] getting more unholy
[22:31] more on moral amen the life of the
[22:33] teenagers are more ungodly than it was
[22:35] the year before
[22:36] amen the marriages are just in much
[22:38] trouble as they ever were and they may
[22:40] publish 15 new books this year in the
[22:42] christian world
[22:42] and they'll have the exact same
[22:44] statistics next year that they had last
[22:46] year
[22:48] because if if you want to have a good
[22:50] marriage first get the holy ghost
[22:53] and the holy ghost is only available in
[22:55] the fullness of the word you've got to
[22:57] receive
[22:57] the person of the word jesus christ
[22:59] revealed to you and with it comes the
[23:01] holy ghost
[23:02] and with that comes the life to live
[23:05] what all those books are talking about
[23:06] and missing a million miles
[23:08] because they start talking about things
[23:10] like you know you've got to have quality
[23:12] time and
[23:12] you've got to you can have all the
[23:15] quality time you want it won't do
[23:16] anything the holy ghost is what does it
[23:20] amen now you take the holy ghost and
[23:23] have quality time and you've got
[23:24] supercharged quality time
[23:27] you've got to beat people to the new
[23:28] birth amen and the birth is in the word
[23:31] you can't be rejecting jesus christ and
[23:33] expecting the life of jesus christ to
[23:35] come
[23:36] when the when the word was restored the
[23:38] full life was restored
[23:39] and receiving that gives you the power
[23:42] to have the family you want
[23:43] the personal victory you want the
[23:45] marriage you want the church you want
[23:47] it's all in the word
[23:50] that's why nothing else will work
[23:54] hallelujah
[23:58] praise god i don't even know what to say
[24:02] next
[24:04] we've got to have this revealed word it
[24:06] does something to us
[24:08] it changes us it breaks away the old way
[24:10] it starts bringing in
[24:12] all kinds of of thoughts we've never had
[24:14] before and we start overcoming things
[24:16] that we've always struggled with
[24:18] and not even knowing exactly how we're
[24:20] overcoming but we're overcome by what
[24:22] by just receiving the word
[24:26] where willpower has failed us for
[24:27] decades all of a sudden god does
[24:29] something supernaturally
[24:31] before we even recognize it and now
[24:32] we're overcoming and how did it happen i
[24:35] don't know how it happened i just kept
[24:36] reading my bible i kept listening to the
[24:38] message i kept coming to church
[24:39] i kept amending to the word and things
[24:41] just kept dropping off of me
[24:45] hallelujah you know that's
[24:49] that's why this social gospel has
[24:51] utterly failed and will completely fail
[24:53] and will never do any good
[24:55] it might help people try really hard to
[24:57] be nice and we want more nice people in
[24:59] the world
[25:00] and if people are not going to have the
[25:01] holy ghost i prefer they read the books
[25:02] and be nice to me
[25:07] but it's not the solution to the problem
[25:12] amen praise god
[25:15] let's go on a little further
[25:19] it's an old battle that started way back
[25:21] beyond time
[25:22] and satan and his angels was kicked out
[25:25] and they come to earth and the battle
[25:26] set in again because eve broke down the
[25:28] barrier from where she was isolated
[25:30] behind the word
[25:31] of god and from that very hour satan won
[25:34] the battle over god's word
[25:36] because one of his subjects the weaker
[25:38] let down the bar
[25:39] and that's exactly how he's won the
[25:41] battle every time
[25:43] has been because one of his subjects let
[25:45] down the bar
[25:46] from the word now do you got it
[25:50] now you got it this would if i ever
[25:53] wrote a book
[25:54] on family on marriage on christian
[25:56] finances on church structure
[25:58] if i ever wrote a book amen i would put
[26:01] this on page one
[26:02] in bold letters and the rest of them
[26:04] would be blank
[26:08] because why does the devil defeat your
[26:10] family because of this
[26:12] why does he defeat you in your personal
[26:13] finances because of this why does he
[26:15] come in and break up the church because
[26:17] of this
[26:18] this is how he wins the battle every
[26:20] time
[26:21] amen he doesn't win it because you
[26:23] forgot to be nice
[26:27] he wanted because you let down somewhere
[26:29] on the word amen
[26:30] and that's why the measure of the word
[26:32] has to be preached and held up here
[26:34] because that's our victory that's how we
[26:36] overcome when we
[26:38] don't let down on the word but we stay
[26:40] with the word then he's defeated
[26:42] but when we let down on the word then
[26:44] he's won the victory
[26:46] over the word remember he's not trying
[26:49] to get the victory over you
[26:52] you're easy for him to defeat
[26:55] you're just flesh you're just in human
[26:57] flesh you're just in a hybrid condition
[27:00] and you're easy to stomp you're easy to
[27:02] beat
[27:02] but what's he trying to get victory over
[27:04] he's trying to get victory over the word
[27:06] of god
[27:07] because god must operate by his own laws
[27:09] and if satan can have victory over the
[27:11] word then satan gets to stay in his
[27:13] position
[27:15] he's a squatter on the earth he's set up
[27:17] as the prince of the power of the air
[27:19] he acts like he's the god of the he is
[27:21] the god of this evil age he acts like
[27:22] he's the god of this earth but he's just
[27:24] a squatter
[27:25] and what gives him right to remain here
[27:27] what gives him the right to remain here
[27:29] is the people of god letting down on the
[27:32] word
[27:34] gives him the right to remain in your
[27:35] life the people of god letting down on
[27:37] the word
[27:38] what gives him a right to stay in your
[27:39] family the people of god letting down on
[27:42] the word
[27:43] amen we bring things into our home that
[27:46] the prophet of god told us not to bring
[27:47] into
[27:48] our home we bring television into our
[27:49] home magazines and all these other
[27:51] things into our home
[27:52] we have trouble in our home and we say
[27:54] how's the devil getting victory
[27:56] because we let down on the word
[27:59] we can't let down on the word and expect
[28:02] to win the battle win the victory
[28:04] and then we struggle with complexes and
[28:06] we struggle with fears
[28:07] we struggle with anxieties and tension
[28:09] and all kinds of problems
[28:11] it's because we let down on the word
[28:14] and when we let down on the word satan
[28:17] who gets victory
[28:18] over the word when one
[28:22] amen one of his subjects the weaker
[28:25] let down the bar
[28:29] i gotta i believe that there's gonna
[28:32] come a time
[28:34] he's not going to get victory over the
[28:37] word
[28:39] that's why god keeps revealing his word
[28:42] that's why
[28:43] our lives keep going higher and higher
[28:45] and higher
[28:46] because why because we're coming to a
[28:48] place where he's not going to have
[28:50] victory over the word of god
[28:52] why because the people of god are going
[28:54] to wake up out of spiritual amnesia
[28:56] and wake up so much to the point where
[28:58] they're not going to give him they're
[28:59] not going to give the white horse any
[29:00] space
[29:01] the red horse rider he's not going to
[29:02] get anything the black horse he's not
[29:04] going to get a thing from me
[29:05] i'm going to stay right here with the
[29:07] pure word of god
[29:10] hallelujah amen
[29:13] so we see the battle plan all the way up
[29:16] and we're focusing right on the end now
[29:20] when brother nestor preached uh
[29:22] spiritual
[29:23] uh armageddon back two months ago
[29:27] he started with this quote and i thought
[29:29] it was fantastic so i'm gonna read this
[29:31] to you out of the first seal
[29:33] said here's the plan of it the first
[29:35] thing happens there is an announcement
[29:37] in the heaven
[29:38] first what happened a seal is open what
[29:40] is that a mystery is unfolded
[29:42] and when a mystery unfolds then a
[29:44] trumpet sounds it declares
[29:46] a war their plague falls and the church
[29:48] age opens see
[29:49] what is the war part the angel of the
[29:51] church catches the mystery of god
[29:53] not fully yet revealed but when he does
[29:55] he catches this mystery of god
[29:57] and then he goes forth to the people
[29:59] after the mystery has been given to him
[30:01] goes forth to the people what does he do
[30:04] out there he begins to proclaim that
[30:05] message
[30:06] and what does it start a war a spiritual
[30:09] war so he's showing the seven church age
[30:12] messengers and how they would each catch
[30:14] something from god and when they would
[30:16] when they would begin to declare that
[30:18] amen that which that would be a trumpet
[30:20] call that would declare
[30:22] a spiritual war
[30:25] praise god so what do you think happens
[30:29] if each age amen each age each mystery
[30:33] revealed
[30:34] amen each trumpet sound declares a
[30:36] spiritual war
[30:37] and you can very clearly see that in in
[30:40] the in the last three church ages you
[30:42] can see what happened
[30:43] when luther began to declare the
[30:45] revelation that the justice saved by
[30:47] faith
[30:47] it started a spiritual war i mean you
[30:50] could see that you can read the
[30:51] histories you can see it
[30:53] and then wesley did the same thing when
[30:54] he come along preaching sanctification
[30:56] it started a spiritual war so much so
[30:58] that when he would preach he would throw
[31:00] stones and rotten fruit at him
[31:03] who was who was throwing the stones and
[31:04] the rotten fruit the church members
[31:08] amen why because he was telling him you
[31:11] can't live holy and drink you can't live
[31:13] holy and run around
[31:14] you can't live holy and do those things
[31:16] and they didn't like what he was saying
[31:19] they didn't care whether it was in the
[31:20] word or not they wanted to stay
[31:23] right where they were they didn't want
[31:24] to change they wanted to be christians
[31:27] part of the anglican church in good
[31:28] standing and they wanted to live as
[31:30] immoral as they wanted to be as drunk as
[31:31] they wanted to
[31:32] and they wanted to stay right there and
[31:34] when wesley come along and said you're
[31:36] in sin
[31:36] you'll die in your sin god calls for a
[31:39] holy sanctified life
[31:40] amen when they did that then they hated
[31:44] him
[31:48] praise the lord that's why anytime a
[31:51] minister starts
[31:52] nailing you on your compromise starts
[31:54] talking about bringing television in
[31:56] your house or
[31:57] spending all your time on the internet
[31:59] or are you into pornography in the
[32:01] movies you shouldn't be into
[32:02] that's why you can't just take and say
[32:04] oh god me now the thing you have to do
[32:06] is dislike the minister
[32:08] has to happen every time because the
[32:10] pattern has to stay true
[32:12] we've got to attack the minister because
[32:14] it can't ever be me
[32:18] amen that's the pattern the pattern
[32:20] never changes
[32:21] wesley wasn't saying anything wrong but
[32:23] what he said they didn't like and they
[32:25] didn't attack his doctrine they didn't
[32:26] go to debate with him on the bible
[32:28] they attacked the man hallelujah
[32:31] some things never change spirits don't
[32:33] die they just migrate to new host bodies
[32:38] every spirit that's been here will
[32:39] always be here
[32:41] hallelujah in the in the first seal
[32:45] brother brennam says now remember in the
[32:47] days of the seventh angel his sounding
[32:49] forth blasting forth the gospel trumpet
[32:51] he is to finish all the mysteries of god
[32:54] so here
[32:55] he's going to seventh angel is going to
[32:56] blast another trumpet and that trumpet's
[32:58] not going to be just what
[33:00] luther said look at the war that broke
[33:01] out when luther brought his revelation
[33:04] look at the war that broke out when
[33:05] wesley brought his revelation
[33:07] now what do you think will happen when
[33:08] it's all seven sounding at once
[33:11] this is going to be a great battle a
[33:14] huge spiritual war
[33:15] and that's the warfare we're in today
[33:20] hallelujah all seven bringing to a great
[33:23] battle
[33:23] not just not just a single church age
[33:27] messenger battle not just a single
[33:28] trumpet battle
[33:29] but seven voices amen seven
[33:33] thunders now bringing to a great battle
[33:37] not a portion of the word creating a
[33:39] stir but the fullness of the word
[33:42] amen if you get the fullness of the word
[33:44] you've got to come to the fullness of
[33:46] the spiritual battle
[33:49] not a partial battle not a church age
[33:51] battle
[33:52] but an end time battle
[33:56] praise god
[34:00] brother rem says in the fourth seal now
[34:03] on this mixed color worldly pale sick
[34:06] horse just think of it
[34:07] you know that's a bad thing now watch
[34:09] where he gathers them from the corners
[34:11] of the earth
[34:12] they are gathered now for the showdown
[34:14] the showdown will be
[34:16] at armageddon according to the word on
[34:18] the pale horse riding on it with a death
[34:20] tact with the nametag death listen
[34:23] antichrist
[34:24] first denomination that that can't be
[34:27] the spirit he's saying the first
[34:28] denomination was the catholic church
[34:30] that can't be the spirit
[34:31] with this jezebel a prostitute to the
[34:34] word
[34:35] with her daughters with her protestants
[34:38] gathering themselves together now in
[34:40] unity
[34:43] now they are joining themselves together
[34:45] now brother branham
[34:47] starts he's talking now about the
[34:49] ecumenical move
[34:51] and i've got some things i want to show
[34:53] you it becomes crystal clear here in a
[34:55] few minutes
[34:56] he's talking about the catholic church
[34:58] wooing the protestants back in the
[34:59] ecumenical move
[35:01] and he says now they're joining
[35:02] themselves together
[35:04] coming to that showdown to armageddon
[35:08] and riding on a mixed colored horse so
[35:10] now the ecumenical move
[35:12] if you understand the ecumenical move
[35:14] all it is is an agreement between
[35:16] churches that we will unify and we will
[35:18] agree
[35:19] together to be brothers and sisters and
[35:21] not fight against each other
[35:23] and then we'll all be considered
[35:24] christians that's the ecumenical move
[35:26] how is the ecumenical move going to
[35:28] bring a worldwide war
[35:30] when they gather against israel to
[35:31] destroy israel
[35:34] you see this it's spiritual and natural
[35:38] hallelujah
[35:43] this ecumenical move is coming to the
[35:46] showdown
[35:46] to armageddon remember the three unclean
[35:49] spirits like frogs
[35:51] that went out what did they do to gather
[35:54] all the kings in all the world to the
[35:55] great day of the battle of almighty god
[35:58] to bring them to armageddon
[36:02] amen gathering his subjects from every
[36:04] nation under heaven
[36:05] did not daniel interpret the dream and
[36:07] seeing that streak of iron running to
[36:09] every kingdom of rome
[36:11] here they come gathering now set still
[36:13] for the close just a minute and listen
[36:16] they're gathering in now to do it
[36:19] bringing his subjects from the four
[36:20] corners of the earth
[36:21] riding a pale sickly three-colored mixed
[36:23] horse same man
[36:25] now listen he's saying he's already
[36:27] gathering all of his subjects together
[36:30] we're not coming to one physical place
[36:32] friends
[36:34] he's already through the ecumenical move
[36:36] gathering together what are they
[36:38] gathering to
[36:38] they're gathering back to this
[36:40] ecumenical system this system of
[36:42] agreement
[36:43] between religions where they break down
[36:44] their doctrinal differences and just
[36:46] agree
[36:47] on the bare minimums tying them back to
[36:50] the catholic church
[36:51] that is gathering to armageddon
[36:56] hallelujah
[37:01] now in revelation 19 not only is he
[37:03] getting ready he's talking about the
[37:04] antichrist is getting ready
[37:06] but christ is getting ready to meet him
[37:08] the battle is going to be hot and heavy
[37:11] hallelujah does that scare you
[37:15] shouldn't scare you the battle is going
[37:17] to be hot and heavy but
[37:18] but i've read the whole book
[37:22] hallelujah we're going to be hot and
[37:25] it's going to be heavy on him
[37:27] amen christ in revelation 19
[37:31] christ is gathering his not from the
[37:33] four corners of the earth because
[37:34] they're going to be a little remnant
[37:35] what is he doing he's gathering them
[37:37] from the four corners of heaven
[37:39] on a snow white horse he also has a name
[37:41] not death but the word of god
[37:43] life amen god it wrote right on his
[37:45] thigh there the word of god
[37:47] that's the only life because god is the
[37:49] only source of eternal life there is
[37:50] zoe is that right he's
[37:54] he's got death wrote on him christ got
[37:56] life thrown on him
[37:57] those with him are on white horses also
[38:00] and they are called the chosen
[38:02] before the foundation of the world amen
[38:04] and they are faithful to the word
[38:06] amen let's go back and read while you
[38:09] got your bibles let's turn to revelation
[38:12] chapter 19. because brother branham is
[38:14] referring to revelation 19 over and over
[38:16] and over again
[38:17] and i'd like to read that together
[38:21] we're going to take our time here a
[38:23] little bit we've got quite a few
[38:24] scriptures we want to read
[38:26] revelation 19 and 11.
[38:30] and i saw heaven open and behold a white
[38:33] horse and he sat upon him was called
[38:35] faithful
[38:36] and true and in righteousness he does
[38:38] judge and make war
[38:39] now recognize here that in revelation 19
[38:44] and revelation 19 he doesn't see
[38:48] the lord on the earth in this white
[38:50] horse
[38:52] he sees heaven open and he sees then he
[38:55] catches the vision of him
[38:57] i saw heaven open and behold a white
[38:59] horse and he that sat upon him was
[39:01] called faithful and true
[39:02] and in righteousness he did judge and
[39:04] make war his eyes were as a flame of
[39:06] fire and on his head were many crowns
[39:08] and he had a name written that no man
[39:10] knew but he himself
[39:11] and he was clothed with a vester dipped
[39:13] in blood and his name is called the word
[39:15] of god
[39:16] and the armies which are in heaven
[39:18] followed him upon white horses clothed
[39:20] and fine linen
[39:21] white and clean and out of his mouth go
[39:24] with a sharp sword that
[39:25] with it he should smite the nations and
[39:27] he shall rule them with a rod of iron
[39:29] and he treadeth the winepress of the
[39:30] fierceness and wrath of almighty god
[39:33] and he hath on his vesture and on his
[39:34] thigh a name written king of kings and
[39:36] lord of lords
[39:38] let's turn back to revelation 17.
[39:42] revelation 17 and 14 talking about the
[39:46] judgment of the
[39:47] says these shall make war with the lamb
[39:50] and the lamb shall overcome them for he
[39:52] is lord of lords and king of kings
[39:54] and they that are with him are called
[39:57] chosen
[39:58] and faithful so
[40:01] these armies that follow after him when
[40:04] they make war with him
[40:05] he he is king of kings and they that are
[40:08] with him
[40:09] are called chosen and faithful amen and
[40:12] they
[40:13] are the armies of heaven
[40:17] the chosen and faithful are the armies
[40:20] of heaven
[40:23] when we get here to revelation 19 this
[40:25] is not referring to an angelic host
[40:30] brother branham said these are the
[40:32] saints
[40:34] so the remember the battle moved from
[40:36] angels
[40:37] to humans we got that
[40:42] so the battle moved from angels to
[40:45] humans
[40:46] so the army must be human
[40:52] and the armies followed after him
[40:55] which were the armies which were in
[40:56] heaven followed after him
[40:58] upon white horses clothed in fine linen
[41:02] white and clean brother in the fourth
[41:05] seal
[41:06] he says those with him are on white
[41:08] horses also
[41:09] and they are called the chosen before
[41:11] the foundation of the world amen
[41:13] they are faithful to the word amen ooh i
[41:15] like that one
[41:16] called chosen before the foundation of
[41:19] the world
[41:21] who's chosen before the foundation world
[41:23] this is predestination
[41:25] now he's going to show us predestination
[41:27] and free moral agency right here
[41:29] in this scripture he said they are
[41:31] chosen before foundation of the world
[41:33] and then faithful to the word by their
[41:36] choosing hallelujah who's he talking
[41:40] about
[41:41] you the armies of heaven you the fa
[41:44] the chosen and faithful chosen from
[41:46] before the foundation of the world
[41:48] and faithful by your own choosing
[41:53] hallelujah you're in the armies of
[41:55] heaven but you must be chosen and
[41:57] faithful to be in this army
[41:58] and to fight in this army you have to be
[42:00] chosen before the foundation of the
[42:02] world
[42:02] and you must also be faithful to the
[42:05] word
[42:06] by your own choosing that means you
[42:09] obey the word you lay down your life for
[42:11] the word you come
[42:12] subject to the word by your own choosing
[42:17] that is the armies that follow him to
[42:19] armageddon that is the armies on white
[42:21] horses with white raiment
[42:22] are the ones that are chosen and
[42:25] faithful
[42:28] i'm chosen i'm chosen but are you
[42:29] faithful
[42:32] because if you're not faithful you can't
[42:34] be part of that army
[42:36] you've got to be chosen and faithful
[42:40] praise god help us to be faithful god
[42:43] help us to be faithful
[42:47] he said they're faithful to the word by
[42:49] their choosing
[42:50] all stimulated with new wine and oil
[42:53] just riding right along coming down to
[42:55] meet him
[42:56] where do you get stimulated with new
[42:58] wine and oil
[42:59] that's the spirit and that's the the
[43:02] stimulation of revelation of the word
[43:04] this is the armies of heaven friends
[43:08] stimulated with new wine and oil
[43:12] praise god oh hallelujah so many places
[43:16] i want to go
[43:17] so many things we want to talk about so
[43:19] little time
[43:21] amen let's just go through the
[43:24] powerpoint now i might back up a little
[43:26] bit
[43:27] and the feast of trump it's note in
[43:29] revelations the ninth chapter in the
[43:30] 13th verse
[43:31] now notice real close under the sixth
[43:33] trumpet revelation 9 13 under the sixth
[43:36] trumpet note there was 200 000 horsemen
[43:39] that had been bound in the river
[43:40] euphrates was turned loose under the
[43:42] sixth trumpet
[43:43] now there's not two hundred thousand
[43:44] horsemen in the world but there was two
[43:46] hundred
[43:47] thousand horsemen notice it i want to
[43:49] jot it down so you can read it
[43:53] they wasn't natural horses they breathed
[43:56] fire and they had breastplates of jasper
[43:58] and they had tails
[43:59] and the end of the tail looked like a
[44:00] serp and a snake's head on the end of it
[44:02] stinging see it was spiritual horses
[44:05] spiritual devils chargers
[44:07] that had been bound in euphrates all
[44:09] these years supernatural devils
[44:13] we got that what was it the
[44:16] old roman empire being revived
[44:19] the persecution of the jews they had
[44:21] been bound for nearly 2 000 years at the
[44:23] river euphrates
[44:24] can't cross to the promise a religious
[44:27] sect that was trying to get to the other
[44:28] side
[44:29] euphrates you know come through eden but
[44:31] they were bound there
[44:32] two hundred thousand devils of
[44:34] persecution
[44:36] if we could if we could look together
[44:39] boy
[44:40] i got one i got further on this quote to
[44:42] go but let's read
[44:44] uh let's read together in revelation
[44:49] no no no sorry revelation 9.
[44:54] this is the one brother bran is
[44:55] referring to the sixth trumpet
[44:57] now you don't have to turn back but i'm
[44:59] going to turn back and just
[45:00] remind you of the sixth vial because
[45:03] you're going to find there's a pattern
[45:04] laid here in in
[45:05] the book of revelation and if we if we
[45:08] try
[45:09] to make every single word that we read
[45:11] and make logical sense to us you'll
[45:13] never
[45:13] understand the book of revelation
[45:15] because here you've got
[45:17] these horses that are coming out these
[45:18] horsemen and breastplates of this and
[45:20] jasper
[45:21] and tails and stings on them and all
[45:23] this and brother brandon said that has
[45:24] nothing to do
[45:26] with something you can see in the
[45:27] physical world that's not
[45:29] that's not like those are tanks and and
[45:31] on the back of tanks they got char
[45:33] no he said these are supernatural devils
[45:37] right so when you read this you have to
[45:38] understand these are supernatural devils
[45:40] that are coming out
[45:42] so in the sixth vial he says he poured
[45:44] out his vial upon the great river
[45:46] euphrates and the water there was dried
[45:48] up that the way of the kings of the east
[45:50] might be prepared
[45:51] so you need the sixth vial has to do
[45:53] with drying up
[45:54] euphrates so that the kings of the east
[45:56] can come across
[45:58] so what does the sixth trumpet have to
[46:00] do with
[46:02] verse 13 and 9 13 and the sixth
[46:05] angel sounded and i heard a voice from
[46:07] the four horns of the golden altar which
[46:09] was before god
[46:10] saying to the sixth angel which had the
[46:11] trumpet loose the four angels which are
[46:14] bound in the great river
[46:15] euphrates so here the sixth trumpet and
[46:19] the sixth file
[46:20] both have to do with euphrates
[46:23] they're linked together friends we'll
[46:26] see what the prophet says about this
[46:31] and the four angels were loose which
[46:33] were prepared for an hour and a day and
[46:35] a month and a year for to slay the third
[46:37] part of men
[46:38] and the number of the army the horsemen
[46:40] were two hundred thousand thousand
[46:42] and i heard the number of them and thus
[46:44] i saw the horses in the vision and them
[46:46] that sat on them
[46:47] having breastplates of fire and adjacent
[46:50] and brimstone and the heads of horses
[46:52] whereas the heads of lions and out of
[46:53] their mouths issued fire
[46:55] smoke and brimstone by these three was
[46:57] the third part of men killed by the fire
[46:59] and the smoke
[47:00] and the brimstone which issued out of
[47:02] their mouths for their powers in their
[47:04] mouth
[47:05] and their tails for their tails were
[47:06] like serpents and had heads and with
[47:08] them they do hurt
[47:10] and the rest of them which were not
[47:11] killed by these plagues yet repented not
[47:13] of the works
[47:14] of their hands that they should not
[47:16] worship devils and idols of gold
[47:18] and silver and brass and stone and of
[47:20] wood which neither can see
[47:21] nor hear nor walk neither repented they
[47:24] of their murders nor of their sorceries
[47:27] nor their fornication
[47:28] nor of their thefts so we're going to
[47:31] we're going to read what brother
[47:32] branham's saying but here he says
[47:34] they're not natural horses he's talking
[47:36] about these horses they're not
[47:38] natural horses he said it's the old
[47:41] roman
[47:41] empire being revived
[47:45] we got that under the sixth trumpet
[47:49] the six the six seals are revelations to
[47:52] the gentiles the six trumpets are
[47:53] revelations to the jews
[47:55] and then the the seals show the
[47:56] redemption of all the elect amen
[47:59] and especially the first four show the
[48:00] redemption of the gentile bride
[48:02] and the gentile church the gentile bride
[48:04] but the the the
[48:06] trumpets show the redemption of the jews
[48:08] the trumpets are to drive them back to
[48:10] the homeland
[48:11] so that they can receive the atonement
[48:13] the true atonement jesus christ
[48:15] when two witnesses come to them but i
[48:18] want you to understand
[48:19] something else if you'll back up with me
[48:21] to verse 8
[48:23] or chapter 8 chapter 8
[48:28] and verse 13 revelation 8
[48:31] and 13. stay with me we're going to go
[48:35] through some details
[48:36] but they're very simple just just
[48:37] because we go through details don't get
[48:39] lost
[48:40] it's very simple when we get to verse 13
[48:42] we've already read through four trumpets
[48:45] and there's three trumpets left the
[48:46] fifth the sixth and the seventh
[48:49] so verse 13 is in between the fourth and
[48:52] the fifth
[48:53] and he says and i beheld and heard an
[48:54] angel flying through the midst of heaven
[48:57] saying with a loud voice woe woe woe
[49:00] to the inhabitants of the earth by
[49:02] reason are the other voices of the trump
[49:04] of the trumpet of the three angels which
[49:06] are yet to sound
[49:08] so here after four trumpets we have an
[49:10] angel come and say whoa
[49:12] whoa whoa brother branham calls us the
[49:14] three woes
[49:15] and he calls it the three world wars
[49:19] and he said the fifth trumpet is world
[49:21] war one
[49:22] the sixth trumpet is world war ii and
[49:25] and and the seventh trumpet is world war
[49:27] three
[49:28] we got that are we together whoa whoa
[49:31] whoa
[49:32] is three world wars war one fifth
[49:35] trumpet
[49:36] world war two sixth trumpet world war
[49:39] three
[49:39] seventh trumpet so that's why brother
[49:41] branham when he sees the sixth trumpet
[49:44] and he sees what happens in the sixth
[49:46] trumpet all these demon powers come out
[49:48] he said it's the old roman empire being
[49:50] revived
[49:51] the persecution of the jews
[49:54] does anybody remember what happened in
[49:56] world war ii
[49:58] were the jews persecuted
[50:02] they had been bound for nearly 2 000
[50:04] years
[50:05] at the river euphrates can't cross to
[50:08] the promise
[50:09] a religious sect that was trying to get
[50:11] to the other side
[50:12] so here brother ben's talking about the
[50:14] binding of the loosing of the four
[50:16] angels and the river euphrates the sixth
[50:18] trumpet
[50:19] and he's talking about the sixth vial
[50:21] because they can't cross the boundary
[50:24] of euphrates because he's going to get
[50:26] into this clearly in a minute
[50:28] because pagan rome became papal rome
[50:32] and mixed christianity in with paganism
[50:34] so that it could continue on
[50:37] and because of that it can't cross into
[50:39] the promises
[50:40] until this boundary of euphrates is
[50:42] taken away
[50:44] so it's held back it's bound and held
[50:46] back for time
[50:48] for a period of time until certain
[50:50] things are accomplished
[50:51] and then the waters dried up then
[50:52] they're released and then they can begin
[50:54] to do
[50:55] what they're anointed to do
[50:58] right who was it in a.d 70 that
[51:01] destroyed
[51:02] jerusalem and scattered the jews it was
[51:05] rome
[51:07] and here brother brandon said for nearly
[51:08] 2 000 years now amen
[51:11] they've been bound by euphrates and
[51:13] euphrates is the border the natural
[51:15] border that was given to the promised
[51:17] land
[51:17] he was told abraham was told you can
[51:19] have this land from the river in egypt
[51:21] to the great river euphrates
[51:22] it's the boundary line for the king of
[51:24] the north and the kings of the east
[51:27] babylon was on euphrates the medes and
[51:30] the persian were beyond euphrates
[51:31] assyria was beyond euphrates amen and
[51:34] the king of the north comes across
[51:35] euphrates
[51:36] so there's a boundary keeping them out
[51:39] of the promise
[51:41] but there's coming a time the boundary
[51:43] will be removed
[51:44] so that they can come in and brother
[51:46] branham said that's the reviving of the
[51:48] old roman
[51:49] empire hallelujah
[51:53] so many of these things we're not
[51:54] waiting for it to happen
[51:58] we've seen a fulfillment and there will
[52:00] be another fulfillment
[52:03] just like joel's prophecy of the four
[52:05] insects and the restoration back
[52:07] that that happened and it happened again
[52:10] and it happened again
[52:11] the same things we're talking about now
[52:13] have happened in the mild form
[52:15] and they're going to happen again in the
[52:18] tribulation period
[52:19] are we together so just because i say
[52:22] that
[52:23] brother baby says this don't think well
[52:24] that now that's over no it's coming
[52:26] again
[52:28] in the tribulation period so are we
[52:31] together
[52:32] they can't cross and brother bam tells
[52:34] us why can't they cross
[52:35] why can't they cross over he said it's
[52:37] the same nature
[52:38] in the catholic church that was in the
[52:39] roman system
[52:41] he says but because they've mixed with
[52:43] christianity
[52:44] because they have a form of christianity
[52:46] they can't cross on and do what they
[52:48] want to do they have to look like
[52:49] christians
[52:51] that's the boundary that's the euphrates
[52:53] that's holding them back
[52:54] they have to maintain the image of
[52:56] christianity because they would love to
[52:58] do what they've always done
[52:59] stomp out and crush with their teeth and
[53:01] stomp underfoot and become absolute
[53:03] dominant and kill all those that oppose
[53:05] them
[53:05] that's what they want to do but they've
[53:08] been held
[53:09] back out of the boundary because of
[53:11] having to appear christian
[53:14] hallelujah oh the message reveals
[53:18] everything same
[53:21] feast of trumpets
[53:25] notice what happens under the sixth
[53:27] trumpet they were turned loose on the
[53:29] jews
[53:29] the persecution of the jews supernatural
[53:32] devils
[53:32] nearly 2 000 years then loosed by stalin
[53:35] hitler upon the jews
[53:37] you say well that isn't rome it's the
[53:39] same spirit
[53:40] they've done the same things that they
[53:42] did to the christians in the old pagan
[53:44] roman days
[53:44] now watch the natural israel and the
[53:47] spiritual church now
[53:49] as we separate it here
[53:55] there was a dictatorship that rose up in
[53:59] germany and one that rose up in italy
[54:00] and
[54:01] and began a persecution against the jews
[54:04] and brother branham attached that to the
[54:07] to the sixth trumpet and those demons
[54:10] coming out
[54:13] is that clear and persecuting
[54:16] the jews because it was the same spirits
[54:19] but those spirits were bound
[54:21] they were limited in what they could do
[54:23] they were held back
[54:25] they couldn't go in and do what they
[54:26] want they were bound in the river
[54:28] the river had to drive so they could
[54:29] cross over and when when it was time
[54:32] they did and what did they do the same
[54:34] thing they always done
[54:36] persecute the jews
[54:41] two thousand years the spirit through
[54:42] the roman people the roman church
[54:44] could not move but the same spirit
[54:47] coming up first
[54:48] down there in mussolini in rome the
[54:50] dictator
[54:51] so that same spirit started first in
[54:54] italy
[54:55] under mussolini and now
[54:58] he loosed upon under the sixth seal
[55:01] these two hundred thousand spiritual
[55:03] demons started in rome
[55:05] germany hitler and notice over in the
[55:07] bible where they received
[55:08] they received power as kings but wasn't
[55:10] crowned a dictator is not crowned king
[55:13] just received power as kings brother
[55:16] branham is referring to the ten kings
[55:19] right and that's coming we agree with
[55:23] that
[55:23] that's ten kings who receive power as
[55:25] kings but he's showing
[55:26] it's already happened it's already gave
[55:28] us a fulfillment
[55:30] it'll have a great fulfillment but it's
[55:31] already had a fulfillment you have to
[55:34] ask yourself why
[55:35] there's some things that brother branham
[55:37] says that it can only be this way
[55:38] friends
[55:39] because there's certain things that have
[55:40] to happen while he's standing on this
[55:42] earth
[55:43] or else he's not in the bible when he
[55:47] comes to his position and his ministry
[55:49] comes and unveils
[55:50] there's certain things that must happen
[55:52] and because if it doesn't happen he's
[55:53] not who he says he was
[55:55] and this is one of the things that must
[55:56] happen while he's here
[56:00] hallelujah oh
[56:03] what a time what a time if we look back
[56:07] and see these things
[56:10] he says there is that roman empire bound
[56:12] there by what
[56:13] the ecclesiastical powers
[56:16] what what are they bound by i thought it
[56:18] was euphrates
[56:20] the ecclesiastical powers which rome
[56:23] pagan rome became papal rome
[56:25] and was bound there in its traditions of
[56:28] christian
[56:30] don't you think when pope francis stands
[56:32] up there and smiles and talks about
[56:34] loving everybody
[56:34] and washes prisoners feet don't you
[56:36] think he's not anointed to the same
[56:38] devil that every other pope's been
[56:39] anointed from
[56:40] and if he didn't have this form of
[56:42] christianity he would absolutely
[56:43] annihilate everything that stands
[56:45] against him
[56:46] but he's got to come in by flatteries
[56:48] because that's the pattern
[56:51] the pattern doesn't change they always
[56:53] come in by flatteries and then they turn
[56:55] come in by flatteries and turn that's
[56:58] the way it has to be
[56:59] that's the word and it's bound there in
[57:02] its traditions of
[57:04] christian what part of christian and
[57:06] superstitions it had of rome putting
[57:08] together
[57:08] all these worship of women and all these
[57:10] other kind of stuff and christmas days
[57:12] and holidays and holy days and things
[57:14] it's been bound with that tradition that
[57:16] it cannot let loose because it's against
[57:18] christian principles it has to keep
[57:21] looking christian
[57:24] come in by flatteries bind all the
[57:26] protestants together
[57:28] get get the political system together
[57:30] and then turn
[57:33] it's bound with tradition that it cannot
[57:35] let loose because it's against christian
[57:37] principles
[57:37] still the same ungodly pagan spirit and
[57:40] that spirit caught into the nations of
[57:42] the world according to the prophecies of
[57:43] ezekiel
[57:44] and the rest of them and they were
[57:46] loosed upon the jew
[57:47] who know nothing of the spirit so now we
[57:51] find out
[57:52] that that this sounding of the sixth
[57:56] trumpet now friends don't
[57:58] don't don't get me wrong i don't believe
[58:00] that the sixth trumpet is finished
[58:03] because we know that all seven trumpets
[58:05] sound under the sixth trump and
[58:07] amen in in the in the full opening of
[58:10] the sixth seal
[58:11] takes place when the two witnesses are
[58:12] here preaching to the 144 thousand
[58:15] i believe that wholeheartedly but what's
[58:17] happening is the same thing that
[58:19] happened in joel's prophecy it happened
[58:20] it happened and it happened
[58:24] same thing's happening here because
[58:26] certain things have to happen while
[58:27] brother branham's here so that he can
[58:28] point them out
[58:29] and point it to the scripture and point
[58:31] to his own ministry
[58:33] and god allowed these things to happen
[58:35] so that the prophet could do that
[58:38] i just want to show you something i'll
[58:40] show you why
[58:42] let's take our bibles and turn
[58:45] to revelation chapter 6. i want you to
[58:48] physically see
[58:50] something in the bible
[58:55] i want to read the sixth seal because
[58:57] the sixth seal and the sixth trumpet and
[58:58] the sixth vial all go together
[59:02] and the sixth seal brother branham now
[59:05] remember
[59:06] remember the three woes world war one
[59:08] world war ii
[59:09] world war three you got that world war
[59:12] ii is the sixth trumpet
[59:13] brother branham said the sixth seal and
[59:15] the sixth trumpet sound at the same
[59:18] time you got that
[59:21] they sound at the same time
[59:25] verse 12 chapter 6 verse 12 when i
[59:27] beheld then
[59:28] he had opened the sixth seal and lo
[59:30] there was a great earthquake and the sun
[59:31] became black as
[59:33] sackcloth of hair and the moon became
[59:35] his blood
[59:36] and the stars of heaven fell into the
[59:38] earth even as a fig tree casteth her
[59:40] untimely figs
[59:41] when she is shaken of a mighty wind and
[59:43] the heaven departed as a scroll when it
[59:45] is rolled
[59:46] together and every mountain and island
[59:47] were moved out of their places
[59:49] and the kings of the earth and the great
[59:51] men and the rich men and the chief
[59:52] captains and the mighty men
[59:54] and every bondman of every free man hid
[59:56] themselves in the dens and in the rocks
[59:58] of the mountains
[59:59] and he said to the mountains and the
[1:00:00] rocks fall on us and hide us from the
[1:00:02] face of him
[1:00:03] that sitteth on the throne and from the
[1:00:04] wrath of the lamb for the great day of
[1:00:06] his wrath has come
[1:00:08] and who shall be able to stand chapter 7
[1:00:12] and after these things after what
[1:00:16] after the six seals after these things
[1:00:20] i saw four angels standing on the four
[1:00:22] corners of the earth holding the four
[1:00:24] winds of the earth
[1:00:25] that the wind should not blow on the
[1:00:26] earth nor on the sea nor on any tree
[1:00:30] and i saw another angel ascend from the
[1:00:32] east having the seal of the living god
[1:00:34] and he cried with a loud voice to the
[1:00:36] four angels to whom it was given to hurt
[1:00:38] the earth and the sea
[1:00:39] saying hurt not the earth neither the
[1:00:41] sea nor the trees till we have sealed
[1:00:44] the servants
[1:00:44] of our god and their foreheads so
[1:00:48] here here we see
[1:00:51] the sixth seal and the sixth trumpet
[1:00:53] sound at the same time
[1:00:54] in world war ii breaks out and
[1:00:56] persecution against the jews come in
[1:00:59] and then there's a cry saying hold back
[1:01:01] the four winds
[1:01:03] it started stop it hold it back
[1:01:07] remember in the sixth trumpet there were
[1:01:09] four angels
[1:01:11] and and the sixth seal after these
[1:01:13] things there's four angels
[1:01:15] that are to hurt the earth and the
[1:01:16] trumpets there's four angels released
[1:01:18] out of euphrates to hurt the earth
[1:01:20] and now after these things he says hold
[1:01:23] it back
[1:01:24] until what until we seal the servants of
[1:01:28] our god in their foreheads
[1:01:31] what happened after world war ii whose
[1:01:33] ministry began to come up
[1:01:36] the seventh church age messenger
[1:01:37] ministry became up and began giving the
[1:01:39] seal of god amen the baptism of the holy
[1:01:42] ghost
[1:01:42] and began to seal the servants and also
[1:01:45] after that time
[1:01:46] now there's going to be two witnesses
[1:01:48] moses and elijah in the form of men
[1:01:50] in israel that will go to israel preach
[1:01:52] the true atonement
[1:01:53] and they will be sealed 144 000.
[1:01:58] we got that so it began
[1:02:02] but it had to stop why did it begin and
[1:02:05] why did they have to stop
[1:02:07] because the prophet had to be here to
[1:02:09] point it out it had to be going on and
[1:02:11] i'm getting ready to show you why
[1:02:13] this is good this is good friends
[1:02:17] so then he says hold it back till we
[1:02:19] seal them and it says i heard the number
[1:02:21] which were sealed
[1:02:23] there were 140 and 4 000 and he starts
[1:02:26] naming 12 000 from each tribe that were
[1:02:28] sealed
[1:02:29] so when are these sealed
[1:02:32] in revelations 11 under the two
[1:02:34] witnesses after the rapture
[1:02:35] amended during the tribulation period
[1:02:37] are we right
[1:02:39] so now between the sixth seal
[1:02:43] turn over to chapter eight
[1:02:46] verse one and when he had opened the
[1:02:48] seventh seal so between the sixth seal
[1:02:51] and the seventh seal 144 000 jews have
[1:02:55] to be marked
[1:02:57] that's revelations 11. that's why he had
[1:03:01] to hold back the four wins
[1:03:04] now now we're in revelations chapter
[1:03:06] eight is everybody in revelation chapter
[1:03:08] eight
[1:03:09] he starts in verse seven the trumpets
[1:03:13] one trumpet two trumpet three trumpet
[1:03:14] four trumpet all the way down
[1:03:16] through through chapter nine chapter
[1:03:18] nine is the fifth trumpet and the sixth
[1:03:20] trumpet
[1:03:21] but all of a sudden there's a gap again
[1:03:23] something stops we don't go to the
[1:03:24] seventh trumpet
[1:03:26] just like after the sixth seal we don't
[1:03:28] go to the seventh seal
[1:03:30] we go to revelations chapter seven where
[1:03:31] the 144 thousand are called out and
[1:03:33] sealed
[1:03:35] now we come to the sixth trumpet
[1:03:38] and the same exact thing happens we
[1:03:40] don't go to the seventh trumpet
[1:03:42] there's another chapter put in between
[1:03:44] and that chapter happens to be
[1:03:45] revelation chapter 10
[1:03:47] the seventh church messenger the
[1:03:49] descending of the mighty angel
[1:03:51] because that's the sealing of the
[1:03:53] gentiles
[1:03:55] so brother branham said in between the
[1:03:57] sixth and seventh seal
[1:03:58] and the sixth and seventh trumpet this
[1:04:01] messenger has to come
[1:04:02] amen and he has to do the ceiling and he
[1:04:04] has to reveal the word all of this has
[1:04:06] to happen when
[1:04:07] between the sixth and seventh trumpet
[1:04:11] where is revelations 10 between the
[1:04:14] sixth
[1:04:14] and seventh trumpets
[1:04:18] why did world war ii have to break out
[1:04:21] why
[1:04:21] the second woe why those demons come out
[1:04:24] and then why hold it back
[1:04:25] because it has to happen between the
[1:04:27] sixth and the seventh trumpet
[1:04:29] is revelations 10. had to be
[1:04:34] amen that had to be already cracked open
[1:04:36] had to be already declared
[1:04:38] had to be already a persecution against
[1:04:40] the jews so the prophet could say
[1:04:42] i came between the sixth and the seventh
[1:04:44] trumpet
[1:04:48] the word is absolutely perfect
[1:04:53] now you have to hold back the four winds
[1:04:56] so that the servants of the lord can be
[1:04:58] sealed talking about the 144 thousand
[1:05:01] and in that time the the gentile bride
[1:05:03] is called at that same time
[1:05:05] then after the rapture the gentile bride
[1:05:07] is gone and the ceiling of the 144
[1:05:09] thousand
[1:05:10] then it's released and that's why
[1:05:12] brother branham says that those two
[1:05:14] witnesses
[1:05:15] they opened the sixth seal why
[1:05:18] because they bring it back from its
[1:05:20] holding pattern being held back
[1:05:22] and now it's fully released when they
[1:05:24] begin now they can call for plagues to
[1:05:27] come
[1:05:27] they can stop it so it rains not they
[1:05:29] can call for earthquakes whenever they
[1:05:31] want
[1:05:31] why because there's no more holding back
[1:05:33] because there's no more ceiling
[1:05:34] now these two witnesses are on the scene
[1:05:36] and they open the sixth seal
[1:05:41] it's written in our bible it's in order
[1:05:44] in the scriptures
[1:05:46] and we've seen it we've seen it in the
[1:05:48] history
[1:05:52] and it's coming again
[1:05:55] all these things are coming again
[1:06:00] now brother ma'am he's going to talking
[1:06:06] in feast of trumpets now he's been
[1:06:09] talking about the persecution to the
[1:06:10] jews
[1:06:11] and those demon spirits coming out of
[1:06:13] euphrates he's talking about all of that
[1:06:15] and now he's going to switch gears
[1:06:21] now there's some marvelous things that
[1:06:23] are happening
[1:06:27] world war ii breaks out
[1:06:30] the second woe the persecution against
[1:06:33] the jews
[1:06:34] we got that the opening of the sixth
[1:06:36] trumpet
[1:06:37] all right between the sixth and seventh
[1:06:39] seal the sixth and seventh trumpet
[1:06:41] you have world war ii persecution of the
[1:06:43] jews all of this tribulation happening
[1:06:45] but then it stopped it's held back and
[1:06:48] right at that time
[1:06:50] amen after after world war ii is stopped
[1:06:53] we see a ministry rise on the scene
[1:06:56] it's a prophetic ministry and brings us
[1:06:58] right to what's in between the 6th and
[1:07:00] 7th trumpet revelations 10
[1:07:02] brings us right to revelations 10.
[1:07:06] hallelujah but during his lifetime
[1:07:13] something else remarkable takes place
[1:07:15] something that's never happened before
[1:07:17] there's this vatican ii council from
[1:07:19] 1962 to 1965
[1:07:22] and there's four meetings in those in
[1:07:23] those years and those four meetings in
[1:07:25] vatican 2
[1:07:26] are the catholics attempt at the
[1:07:28] ecumenical movement
[1:07:29] the catholics begin to change their
[1:07:31] rules and regulations and begin to let
[1:07:32] down the bars
[1:07:33] so that they can accept other religions
[1:07:39] and it happens in the prophet's lifetime
[1:07:43] both world war ii both world war one
[1:07:46] and world war ii and the ecumenical move
[1:07:49] the world council of churches started in
[1:07:51] 1948
[1:07:52] just after the war right when brother
[1:07:53] branham's ministry was really taking off
[1:07:55] you see the parallel tracks
[1:07:57] god and the devil are running on
[1:07:59] parallel tracks the battle plan all the
[1:08:00] way through
[1:08:01] and so now you see all these things that
[1:08:03] are happening in his life world war one
[1:08:04] when he's a boy
[1:08:05] world war ii then his ministry springs
[1:08:07] up then the world council of churches
[1:08:09] began
[1:08:10] then we come to the end of his ministry
[1:08:11] and now vatican ii
[1:08:13] amen the old roman system starts calling
[1:08:15] for all the little
[1:08:17] all the holy harlot churches to come
[1:08:18] back that's what started it right here
[1:08:21] it didn't start some other lifetime what
[1:08:23] started the ecumenical move what started
[1:08:25] the mother calling back all the
[1:08:27] harlots
[1:08:28] right here vatican 2 1962-1965
[1:08:32] and the last meeting was december 8th
[1:08:34] three weeks before brother branham dies
[1:08:39] perfectly on time
[1:08:43] he says in the feast of trumpets notice
[1:08:45] the loosing of this ecclesiastical
[1:08:47] spirit
[1:08:48] now 20 years later after that war we
[1:08:52] see the loosing of the ecclesiastical
[1:08:54] spirit
[1:08:58] you know how significant this is when
[1:09:00] those demons were released out of the
[1:09:02] river euphrates
[1:09:04] they went and started a persecution
[1:09:06] against the jews
[1:09:08] now see the persecution against the jews
[1:09:10] is always physical
[1:09:12] because the jews are through a certain
[1:09:14] birth order
[1:09:15] and in that birth order israel is
[1:09:17] sprinkled the true israelites are
[1:09:19] sprinkled
[1:09:20] through that birth order so if you can
[1:09:22] annihilate
[1:09:23] all of that seed you've got all of god's
[1:09:25] seed that come up through israel
[1:09:28] but the gentiles are not so the gentiles
[1:09:30] are a spiritual seed that pops up
[1:09:32] it's not like you can say if we get rid
[1:09:34] of all the germans we've got rid of all
[1:09:35] the children of god you can't do that
[1:09:36] with the gentiles
[1:09:38] like you can with the jews so that's why
[1:09:40] the jews is always a
[1:09:41] physical persecution and the gentiles
[1:09:44] are
[1:09:45] always a spiritual persecution
[1:09:50] he tries to kill the jews physically and
[1:09:53] he tries to kill the gentiles
[1:09:55] spiritually see the path
[1:09:59] we're on the same path so because all of
[1:10:02] god's jewish children are going to pop
[1:10:04] up in that family
[1:10:05] he's got to wipe out that family to take
[1:10:07] out god's seed through the jews
[1:10:08] and kill god's promise to have jews to
[1:10:11] have a nation
[1:10:13] but it's not that way with the gentiles
[1:10:15] you can't kill all the armenians you
[1:10:16] can't kill all the italians
[1:10:18] you can't do that it pops up everywhere
[1:10:20] so you have to kill them
[1:10:21] spiritually with spiritual death through
[1:10:24] deception
[1:10:26] and so now when all these demons come
[1:10:28] flooding out these two hundred thousand
[1:10:29] thousand demons coming out
[1:10:31] you see exactly what their nature is you
[1:10:33] see what their spirit is
[1:10:35] because they go right into hitler's army
[1:10:37] and what do they do
[1:10:38] all of a sudden they they start they
[1:10:40] start having a
[1:10:42] terrible war i mean hitler's army was
[1:10:45] unbelievable they were fast they were
[1:10:48] efficient
[1:10:48] they had the best technology their
[1:10:50] scientists started creating things on a
[1:10:52] rapid scale
[1:10:53] what were they anointed by demon spirits
[1:10:57] you can see it if you study world war ii
[1:10:59] you can see those are demon spirits let
[1:11:01] loose
[1:11:03] right and then a hatred toward the
[1:11:05] jewish people
[1:11:06] amen and they would come up with all
[1:11:08] kinds of systems and camps and
[1:11:10] transport systems and tracking systems
[1:11:13] just to persecute the jews
[1:11:15] that's the nature of those demon powers
[1:11:18] but remember it's physical to the jews
[1:11:20] it's
[1:11:21] spiritual to the gentiles and after god
[1:11:24] said hold
[1:11:24] back the winds and world war ii stopped
[1:11:27] and the persecution of the jews stopped
[1:11:28] so that they can move into their
[1:11:30] homeland to receive the two witnesses
[1:11:32] to receive the feast of atonement when
[1:11:34] that stopped
[1:11:35] now all those demons left the natural
[1:11:38] army of hitler
[1:11:39] and they moved into the ecclesiastical
[1:11:41] realms
[1:11:43] those demons didn't go back into
[1:11:45] euphrates
[1:11:49] brother branham said now the loosing of
[1:11:52] the ecclesiastical spirit
[1:11:54] now 20 years later after that war
[1:11:57] we see the loosing of the ecclesiastical
[1:11:59] spirit
[1:12:00] now those demons move into vatican ii in
[1:12:03] the ecumenical move
[1:12:06] and brother brenham was here to declare
[1:12:08] it
[1:12:09] do you know how supernatural that is you
[1:12:12] know how unbelievable
[1:12:13] the history matches the scriptures
[1:12:16] matches the testimonies matches
[1:12:18] everything
[1:12:21] feast of trump has noticed we find now
[1:12:22] that the natural power under the natural
[1:12:24] to a natural nation
[1:12:25] israel was loosed there and what did it
[1:12:28] do it went and made war and how it
[1:12:30] murdered and persecuted
[1:12:32] now in ecclesia now in the
[1:12:34] ecclesiastical realm
[1:12:36] i hope that god opens your eyes to this
[1:12:38] now because i realize
[1:12:39] this is just not speaking to this church
[1:12:41] here this tape goes worldwide
[1:12:43] and i don't mean to hurt anybody's
[1:12:45] feelings but just to tell the truth
[1:12:47] now the ecclesiastical realm has been
[1:12:48] opened
[1:12:50] from the natural revival the old pagan
[1:12:52] rome went forth on the jews
[1:12:53] which has always been their enemy the
[1:12:55] lion with teeth and everything it
[1:12:57] stopped
[1:12:58] stomped down and broke the people rome
[1:13:01] always been god's enemy and it was
[1:13:03] turned loose in the same
[1:13:04] spirit by the dictators of the world
[1:13:07] because the religious system was still
[1:13:08] holding
[1:13:09] now it's been loosed
[1:13:12] it went to the dictators of the world
[1:13:14] and unleashed a man of war and
[1:13:16] unleashed a physical persecution because
[1:13:19] the religious system was still holding
[1:13:22] now it's been loosed
[1:13:27] hallelujah
[1:13:30] what has it done in the cunningness as
[1:13:33] he said and
[1:13:34] and come to like flatteries and what has
[1:13:35] he done he's bringing the protestant
[1:13:38] ecumenical council of world churches the
[1:13:40] spirit of antichrist upon both of them
[1:13:42] bringing them to the slaughter just like
[1:13:44] they did the other in the
[1:13:46] hour to call the bride now how
[1:13:49] loosed in the ecclesiastical church
[1:13:51] spirit loosed upon what
[1:13:53] not upon the denominations upon the
[1:13:56] bride
[1:13:59] because they're calling the
[1:14:00] denominations it's not loosed upon the
[1:14:02] denominations
[1:14:03] it's loosed upon the bride but
[1:14:06] here you'll get it the bride will
[1:14:09] not go through that time the bride will
[1:14:13] not go
[1:14:14] through the tribulation period the bride
[1:14:16] will not go through that time amen
[1:14:18] the bible says not the church will but
[1:14:20] not the bride
[1:14:21] can't you see ministers can't you see
[1:14:23] that brethren
[1:14:28] so what's been happening since the
[1:14:30] prophet left the scene
[1:14:34] those spirits that went into the armies
[1:14:37] of hitler went into the nations and
[1:14:39] began a persecution and war and all this
[1:14:41] stuff where did they go
[1:14:43] they went to the ecclesiastical realms
[1:14:45] in vatican ii they went into the
[1:14:46] ecumenical move
[1:14:47] and now it was loosed in the ecumenical
[1:14:50] move first it was loosed in physical war
[1:14:52] then held back it's been loosed in the
[1:14:54] ecclesiastical now
[1:14:56] now it's been infiltrating and dropping
[1:14:59] the bars and dropping the bars and
[1:15:01] dropping the bars until
[1:15:02] now there's no difference between these
[1:15:04] churches
[1:15:06] now there's really no there's really no
[1:15:09] doctrinal difference that we'll stand
[1:15:11] apart and fight for
[1:15:12] there's nothing that we're going to
[1:15:13] stand our ground on doctrinally
[1:15:15] we'll just let it fade to the side and
[1:15:17] we believe in a trinity and we believe
[1:15:19] in
[1:15:19] in the salvation through the blood of
[1:15:21] jesus and we believe in these things and
[1:15:22] that's all you have to believe in
[1:15:24] and that's good enough and you can be
[1:15:25] part of the buddy system now what are
[1:15:27] they doing they're being gathered to the
[1:15:29] slaughter
[1:15:31] gathered to armageddon gather to the
[1:15:33] slaughter amen because
[1:15:35] in order to do that you have to reject
[1:15:36] the truth you have to reject scriptures
[1:15:39] you have to lay it down and turn aside
[1:15:41] and you have to reject jesus christ to
[1:15:43] come into the ecumenical movement
[1:15:47] and so now in the ecclesiastical realm
[1:15:49] he's been gathering
[1:15:50] amen and vatican do them in gathering
[1:15:53] the protestants to themselves
[1:15:54] and they're moving in and remember the
[1:15:56] video we showed two years ago
[1:15:58] of kenneth copeland going back to the
[1:16:00] catholic church do you remember that
[1:16:03] kenneth copeland he gets a message from
[1:16:05] pope francis and then there's this
[1:16:07] there's this bishop of the anglican
[1:16:08] church there and
[1:16:09] he's welcoming them in and talking about
[1:16:11] now we want to keep
[1:16:12] we want to keep the final prayer of
[1:16:14] jesus christ when he said we want to be
[1:16:16] one
[1:16:16] amen father may they be one amen and we
[1:16:19] should be one
[1:16:20] and he's missing the whole point because
[1:16:22] jesus said may they be one
[1:16:24] as we're one well how was god and the
[1:16:27] father one are jesus and the father
[1:16:29] he was one because he did everything
[1:16:30] that the father said he was the
[1:16:32] fulfillment of the word the thought of
[1:16:33] jesus christ
[1:16:34] they were in perfect unity and harmony
[1:16:36] on the word because he was the
[1:16:38] originator word this was the expression
[1:16:40] of the word
[1:16:44] it came from the mind of god and
[1:16:45] manifest in the body of jesus christ and
[1:16:47] he was the fulfillment of the mind of
[1:16:49] god
[1:16:50] and that that there the fulfillment of
[1:16:52] the mind of god
[1:16:55] is oneness
[1:16:58] do we have that the fulfillment of the
[1:17:01] mind of god
[1:17:02] is true oneness and so now if you're
[1:17:05] going to be one we have to be the one
[1:17:07] the way that jesus and the father are
[1:17:09] one
[1:17:10] perfectly aligned to the thought of god
[1:17:12] perfectly aligned in the word hallelujah
[1:17:17] praise the lord god is good
[1:17:20] god bless you brother amen
[1:17:24] so now we've got to come back to perfect
[1:17:26] alignment with the word if we're going
[1:17:27] to be one the way jesus and the father
[1:17:29] are one
[1:17:31] we can't just be one by letting down the
[1:17:32] bars and ignoring the word and acting
[1:17:34] like the scripture doesn't count
[1:17:36] and saying you lay down your word i'll
[1:17:37] lay down my word we'll all lay down the
[1:17:39] word
[1:17:40] and come to as little word as possible
[1:17:41] so that we don't disagree with one
[1:17:43] another
[1:17:44] that's not being won as god and the
[1:17:46] father were one
[1:17:47] that's a false unity amen and that's
[1:17:50] that's that's driven by demon powers
[1:17:53] and what's it coming to do it's coming
[1:17:55] to bring a persecution against those who
[1:17:58] won't go along with it
[1:17:59] it's coming to bring a persecution
[1:18:01] against those who don't want to drop the
[1:18:03] bars who don't want to ignore the word
[1:18:05] who don't want to turn their back on
[1:18:07] jesus christ
[1:18:08] but want the full word with the full
[1:18:10] manifestation of the full word in their
[1:18:12] lives
[1:18:12] and will not compromise on the word and
[1:18:14] what do they do they want to shut it up
[1:18:18] hallelujah
[1:18:22] brother bennett says in the laodicean
[1:18:24] church age of the church age book
[1:18:27] the wheat and the tares which from the
[1:18:29] first age until now have grown side by
[1:18:31] side are harvested
[1:18:32] what nicea set out to accomplish has
[1:18:34] finally come to pass
[1:18:36] with all the might of the organization
[1:18:37] the false church turns from
[1:18:39] any vestige of truth and with political
[1:18:41] might reinforces herself with state
[1:18:43] backing
[1:18:44] and sets out to eradicate forever the
[1:18:46] true believer
[1:18:48] remember the same spirit that was in
[1:18:51] nazi germany
[1:18:53] is the same spirit that's in the
[1:18:54] ecumenical move
[1:18:57] but there still has to look christian
[1:19:02] but there'll come a time when
[1:19:03] everything's wrapped up tight
[1:19:05] and everybody's let down the bar so much
[1:19:07] they don't even know what christian is
[1:19:08] anymore
[1:19:09] and now true christianity will look like
[1:19:11] hate true christianity will look like
[1:19:13] intolerance true christianity will look
[1:19:15] like it's evil
[1:19:18] and then they'll justify themselves in
[1:19:20] eradicating this
[1:19:22] thing that's against our harmony our
[1:19:24] unity what's bringing the whole world to
[1:19:25] peace
[1:19:26] there's these people who won't go along
[1:19:27] with it and keep crying out against it
[1:19:29] and they won't shut up
[1:19:32] they won't be shut up they keep saying
[1:19:33] it's wrong they keep telling other
[1:19:35] people it's wrong
[1:19:36] then we've got to stop it
[1:19:40] so build a system to eradicate forever
[1:19:42] the true believer
[1:19:43] same spirit it just has had to look
[1:19:46] christian
[1:19:48] but for 50 years now it's been changing
[1:19:50] the definition of christian
[1:19:54] it's been working hard for 50 years to
[1:19:57] change
[1:19:58] christian ideas and christian principles
[1:20:00] and christian morals
[1:20:02] so that they can do what they want to do
[1:20:04] to take power and control
[1:20:06] and still look christian
[1:20:09] why do you think the morality in
[1:20:10] christianity has been falling so fast so
[1:20:13] far
[1:20:13] why do you think it's been coming
[1:20:15] crashing down all around us
[1:20:16] because it's an attempt by these
[1:20:18] ecclesiastical spirits
[1:20:20] to make the way to drain
[1:20:23] euphrates so that the kings can come
[1:20:25] across
[1:20:28] held back by the ecclesiastics but been
[1:20:29] whittling away and whittling away the
[1:20:32] barrier and witting away the barrier
[1:20:33] till there's no clear distinction
[1:20:35] and we don't know what true christianity
[1:20:37] is anymore and now the model of it is in
[1:20:40] the bride of jesus christ and she's such
[1:20:42] a contrast to the rest of the christian
[1:20:44] world
[1:20:44] that the evil spirits have to remove the
[1:20:47] true
[1:20:47] christianity so that their facade can
[1:20:50] continue
[1:20:53] hallelujah
[1:20:57] praise god you know the seals you know
[1:21:00] everything
[1:21:03] you know the message everything's
[1:21:04] revealed
[1:21:07] he says now eradicate the
[1:21:10] true believer but just when she is about
[1:21:13] to accomplish her cowardly plot
[1:21:16] the wheat is gathered to the garnet
[1:21:19] there is nothing for us to be afraid of
[1:21:23] you stand as true to that word as you've
[1:21:25] always stood because that's your purpose
[1:21:27] on this earth
[1:21:28] is to fight back against this devil
[1:21:30] fight back against these ecclesial
[1:21:32] systems
[1:21:32] and stay true to jesus christ which is
[1:21:35] the word
[1:21:36] made manifest in your age
[1:21:41] the word may manifest in your age that's
[1:21:44] jesus christ
[1:21:46] and we have to stay true to jesus christ
[1:21:51] and are they going to come against her
[1:21:52] absolutely are they going to try to shut
[1:21:54] her down
[1:21:55] it's prophesied to happen will they do
[1:21:57] it no
[1:21:58] she'll be gathered into the garner
[1:22:02] so if if i'm going to be gathered into
[1:22:05] the garner when this happens amen
[1:22:07] there's going to come a time when all
[1:22:09] the world all the ecumenical system is
[1:22:10] gathering against the bride to try to
[1:22:12] shut her down
[1:22:13] and i'm not going to be a pipsqueak
[1:22:14] keeping quiet not saying anything
[1:22:16] because all of a sudden all we're going
[1:22:18] to get gathered away and i never had my
[1:22:20] chance to get a few licks in
[1:22:23] but we're going to fight the battle
[1:22:24] right now we're going to overcome the
[1:22:26] devil right now
[1:22:27] we're going to declare the truth not
[1:22:28] just in word but in deed
[1:22:30] and manifestation of the holy ghost
[1:22:32] we're going to live this word amen
[1:22:35] so much so that they've got to stop you
[1:22:37] because you're contrary
[1:22:38] to the rest of the system and we're
[1:22:41] going to live it we're going to be bold
[1:22:43] about it and we're going to stand true
[1:22:44] not me not
[1:22:45] arrogant not angry but true to the word
[1:22:48] never backing down one bit from the word
[1:22:51] until he comes and
[1:22:52] gathers us away and says well done
[1:22:55] my good and faithful servant
[1:22:58] i don't want to be hiding in a corner
[1:23:00] the day he comes to take us home
[1:23:02] i don't want to be cowering from the
[1:23:03] battle when he comes to take us home
[1:23:05] i want to be standing on the front lines
[1:23:07] giving it everything i've got
[1:23:08] with a life that matches the word with a
[1:23:10] marriage that matches the word with
[1:23:12] children that match the word
[1:23:14] amen with a church that matches the word
[1:23:15] with my personal private life that
[1:23:17] matches the word
[1:23:18] with a prayer life with a vindication
[1:23:20] with a prayer with healing with the
[1:23:22] anointing of the holy ghost i want to be
[1:23:24] standing there on the front line that
[1:23:26] day he comes and gathers us to the
[1:23:27] garden
[1:23:28] i don't want to be hiding under my bed
[1:23:30] saying lord please god i don't want to
[1:23:31] be
[1:23:32] no brothers and sisters i have been
[1:23:35] called you have been called to take the
[1:23:39] battle on the front lines
[1:23:40] in satan's eden right here
[1:23:44] today is the place that we fight
[1:23:47] we don't fight with fists and we don't
[1:23:48] fight with with stones
[1:23:50] what do we fight with we fight with the
[1:23:52] word of god we don't just say
[1:23:54] words amen the word has to be on display
[1:23:57] it's got to be lived
[1:24:02] brother brennan said in christ is a
[1:24:04] mystery god revealed
[1:24:05] in his church stands alone she's not
[1:24:07] hooked with nothing
[1:24:08] but he was identified by god being the
[1:24:10] body that god dwelled in
[1:24:12] and the church is identified by his body
[1:24:14] doing the same thing
[1:24:15] she is his body the manifested truth of
[1:24:18] his promised word for the last day
[1:24:20] what is she she is his body
[1:24:24] doing the same thing she is his body
[1:24:28] the manifested truth of his promised
[1:24:31] word
[1:24:32] for this last day
[1:24:35] and she and she alone stands by it
[1:24:38] that's why the devil's howling
[1:24:40] these great organizations so set up
[1:24:42] something to close her
[1:24:44] up what is this what's been happening
[1:24:47] for the last 50 years
[1:24:49] since vatican ii building the system
[1:24:52] building the system tearing down the
[1:24:55] walls
[1:24:55] drying up euphrates everything is ready
[1:24:58] changing christianity changing the word
[1:25:01] changing what it means to be a believer
[1:25:03] getting it ready for what for for the
[1:25:06] for the
[1:25:06] old roman empire to rise again
[1:25:10] and it'll happen so fast it'll shock you
[1:25:14] remember when when hitler came to power
[1:25:17] amen germany had been defeated in a war
[1:25:19] before
[1:25:20] they signed a decree in 1919 that
[1:25:22] they're they're they're going to
[1:25:25] pay for their crimes they're gonna you
[1:25:27] know demilitarize somewhat and all of
[1:25:29] this
[1:25:30] then hitler come to power amen in 1933.
[1:25:35] in 33 1933 he started building back the
[1:25:38] system
[1:25:38] building back the system building back
[1:25:40] the system and he launched a war in 1939
[1:25:43] just six years after he started doing it
[1:25:45] between five and six years after
[1:25:47] and they were one of the most powerful
[1:25:49] military forces on the earth
[1:25:52] why they were anointed by 200 000 000
[1:25:54] demons out of the
[1:25:56] river euphrates see it doesn't take very
[1:25:59] long for everything you know to be
[1:26:01] normal to flip on its head
[1:26:03] in germany overnight everything changed
[1:26:06] amen in poland overnight everything
[1:26:09] changed in holland overnight everything
[1:26:11] changed
[1:26:12] it doesn't take very long for everything
[1:26:13] to be flipped why
[1:26:15] because those same 200 000 000 demons
[1:26:18] that work there
[1:26:19] are the same ones working now
