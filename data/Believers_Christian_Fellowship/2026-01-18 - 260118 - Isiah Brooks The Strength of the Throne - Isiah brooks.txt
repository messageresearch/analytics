We've been looking forward to this service and he came in for Sister Marilyn Brown's 95th birthday. We were there yesterday and celebrated with her. Lord certainly been good to her, giving her health and strength and long life and and so while he was visiting, it was [music] so nice to have him. Brother Isaiah is well known to many of us. If you don't know, he's a pastor out in Iowa. Been pastoring there 18 years. [music] But before that, he was pastor here in Lima for 17 years at Bible believers. So, he's a great friend and he's [music] well loved and respected in the area. And so, we're so glad he could join us for the service today. Amen. I just want to tell you that we have a baptism at the end of service. So, we're so excited to be here for that. Brother Emanuel Bondo has desired to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [applause] [music] So, we are excited to see him baptized in the name of the Lord. Brother Isaiah is also here with his wife, Sister Ruby, their daughter, Sister [music] Crystal. Crystal and her son, Judah. God bless you. It's good to have you along as well. [music] Quite a privilege. Want to say too, I enjoyed the specials. Thank you so much for that, for the [music] testimonies this morning. It was just exciting to hear what God is doing. Such an encouragement to all of us who are holding on to the word to see that he's touched our brothers and sisters. He's still faithful to his word. What he promised, he still [music] performs. Amen. And so, it's so exciting. So, we just want to go ahead and give the time to brother Isaiah. We're going to turn the service over to him so he can take his liberty. We want him [music] to relax. We want him to just share what the Lord has delivered to him and placed on his heart for us this morning. [music] And I don't know about you, but I've come to get my portion. &gt;&gt; I've come to receive from the Lord his word [music] for my needs. Amen. So, let's just welcome Brother Isaiah. [music] Breath fill my cup. [music] I lift it up. [chant] [music] Come [singing] [music] in this thirsty [singing] of my [music] soul. [chant] [singing] I [music] am feeding [singing] till I [music] hear [singing] my cup. [music] Fill it up [singing] and make me. [music] Let's just raise our hands saying again to my cup of Lord [music] I lift it up. [singing] [music] I [singing] quit this thirsting [music and singing] of my soul. of heaven. [music and singing] Feed me till I [singing] [music] [singing] hear [music] my cup. Fill me up [singing] and [music] make me. [singing] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sure that's everybody's desire this morning. We're so glad to be here by the grace of God. We appreciate the invitation uh given to us by our pastor and brother Chad Lamb. Amen. We've had such a wonderful uh experience uh since being here here, excuse me. Uh we had dinner or supper, whichever you want to call it, at his house. It was a great time. The food was delicious and the hospitality was great. And we just thank God for that &gt;&gt; because you know people don't have to do for you. &gt;&gt; They don't have to be kind to you. &gt;&gt; They don't have to be nice. &gt;&gt; But when people do that is their choosing. &gt;&gt; And so you should always appreciate &gt;&gt; the least of things &gt;&gt; when someone willfully do something for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I just want you to know that we appreciate your pastor and we appreciate being here by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's have a word of prayer and then I have you be seated. I'm going to sing just a song or so. Gracious heavenly father God, we thank you for your grace and your mercy. We thank you for being so good to us. Lord, you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves. Father, there is no words to express our gratitude. Words in the English language cannot express what we feel inside because what we are feeling Lord comes from a divine revelation. And there are no words in the earthly language that can express what I'm feeling. Father, we pray here that you bless the service. Lord, this is about you and not me. We come, oh God, to hear from you, Lord. And Lord, as we humble ourselves before you because even as your prophet said, Lord, we're just a stinking stable that you have chosen to be born in. &gt;&gt; And Lord, as humble as we know how, we bow before you. and we say please uh have thine own way &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Down from his glory, everliving story. [singing] My God and Savior [singing] came and Jesus was his name. Born in a [singing] manger [music] to his own a strangeanger. [singing] All men of sorrows, tears, and agony. [music] Oh, I love him. I adore [music] him. My breath, my son, [music] shine. Hallelujah. My all [singing] in all, the [singing] great creator became my savior. [music] and all God's [singing] fullness [music] dwell [singing] in him. What come [singing and music] bringing us redemption? [music] Help me sing it. that in the dead. Hallelujah. Not [singing] one [music] faith hope inside. God's grace has tender [singing] [music] laid aside his splendor. [singing] [music] You being to [music and singing] win to save my soul. [singing] Oh, I love [singing] him. Yes, sir. [music] I adore [singing] him. My breath, my soul. [music] Shout along my all [singing] in [music] all. Hallelujah. The great [singing] [music] creator became my savior [music and singing] and all God's fullness [music and singing] dwelling in [music] him. [singing] Without we [music and singing] love flesh and blood his substance. [singing] [music] Think about it. He took the fork of [music] me revealed [singing] God's king and blame. Oh, glorious [music] mystery, sacrifice of [music] Calary. And [music and singing] now I know who the great [music and singing] I am. Oh, I love [music] you. I [screaming] adore [music and singing] you. My son, [music] my [singing] all in all, [singing] the great creator, [music] became my savior. [singing] [music] Hallelujah. God's fullness [singing] [music] dwell in me. Hallelujah. [music] And all God's fullness [singing] dwelling in [music] him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us stand. One thing I just want to say that uh the Lord has been so good to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if anybody can praise him, I can. &gt;&gt; This message is the greatest thing that ever struck the earth. &gt;&gt; And God knows we should never handle it lightly. &gt;&gt; He's doing something. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I am so grateful. Amen. This morning to be a part of this great event. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We are the generation &gt;&gt; that God has chosen to defeat Satan, &gt;&gt; not by might, &gt;&gt; not by power, &gt;&gt; but by my spirit, sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so happy uh this morning uh because I see the message changing me. Amen. &gt;&gt; There for so many years I I tried to change me &gt;&gt; but once you understand the true revelation of grace &gt;&gt; it gives you a deeper love &gt;&gt; for your savior &gt;&gt; as we stand let us turn to Isaiah 14 chapter 14 we're going to start reading at the 13th verse. [snorts] Thank you, musicians. For thou for thou hast said in thine heart, starting at the 13th verse, I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I will be like the most high. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the size of the pit. And they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man &gt;&gt; that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms? Revelations 3 2122. [snorts] To him that overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne. He that have an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Our gracious heavenly father God, we come before you, Lord, as humbly as we know how. We thank you for being so good to us, &gt;&gt; Lord. We just come to share to give to the church what you have given us. And Lord, I pray this morning that somewhere somehow someone will know that you are in in this [snorts] place. Break the yoke, destroy the works of the enemy. And if there be anyone that needs salvation, I pray, Father God, that you would open their hearts, their minds, their souls to receive you. Because, Father, this is your work. We're just here, Lord, being used by you. We count it a privilege and an honor. And so therefore, Lord, we ask you that you give us grace to move completely out of way, out of your way, that you would have preeminence in this service. And we'll be careful to give you the praise. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Well, we know by the grace of God the story. [snorts] My subject would be the strength of the throne. We understand by the grace of God how it all started. God creating everything because of what he had in his mind. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We also know that the first Adam fell, &gt;&gt; he lost our inheritance. But God wasn't through with mankind. &gt;&gt; Now, some of us may not like this. Excuse me. [clears throat] Some of us may not like this journey that we're going through &gt;&gt; right now. But I am so happy &gt;&gt; because I understand the journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We understand by God's grace that without this, &gt;&gt; how would you ever love God? Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Adam didn't really know how much he loved Eve &gt;&gt; until she fell. &gt;&gt; See, you don't understand. Love is always tried. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God tried Adam. We know how it all went down. The Lord blessed and Adam became the very sacrifice, if you want to say it like that, &gt;&gt; for Eve. because had he not &gt;&gt; joined with her, we wouldn't be here today. &gt;&gt; But in all of that, it looked like throughout all the ages, Satan was getting the best. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Especially in this last seventh age or in the age of, you know, the Pentecostal age or the Leoian age. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; It just looked like Satan was having havoc over the people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The deception was so great &gt;&gt; until God had to send us a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And had not God sent us in Malachi 4, we would be the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I'm so thankful for the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Because we know that when he died, he conquered death, hell, and the grave. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't complete. &gt;&gt; That same high priest had to come again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that in 1963 he came. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; The book was open. &gt;&gt; The seals were loose. &gt;&gt; He came in his presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's still here. Amen. &gt;&gt; When Adam before falling, he ruled &gt;&gt; the world or Eden. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; According to the prophet of God, we know that whatever Adam would say, &gt;&gt; that word would not come back void. &gt;&gt; If he would say to the mountain, we move or tree be plucked up and move. All nature, all animals obeyed him. &gt;&gt; Why? Because in reality, he had the title deed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That is the power of the word being open. &gt;&gt; When God said, "Eat the book." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's what he means. &gt;&gt; Now, we understand none of us are eating a book. &gt;&gt; That's right. But he's basically telling us to ingest it. &gt;&gt; Not only do we ingest the word, we digest the word. &gt;&gt; Cuz once we digest the word, we become the word. &gt;&gt; So we understand Sat Satan doesn't understand that. He he think he knows. &gt;&gt; His wisdom is of this world. &gt;&gt; His wisdom is science. &gt;&gt; He doesn't even understand faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; We who are of this generation, &gt;&gt; we are what we call a faith generation. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the just shall live by his faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not ours. His faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is why it's so important &gt;&gt; to be able to understand the message &gt;&gt; in the sense that you just don't become a believer because you say, "I believe." Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan believes and tremble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we know by the grace of God that if you truly believe, you will act upon the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That has been given to you. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know that justification bring forth sanctification. Sanctification bring forth the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And that Holy Ghost make room for the person of Jesus Christ. Can I say this? By the grace of God, &gt;&gt; when God opened uh the word, &gt;&gt; it truly exposed Satan. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To a place that he was just totally naked. &gt;&gt; When we're not stumbling over his tactics, &gt;&gt; we understand him. &gt;&gt; We understand the battle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But we also understand the victory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Coming from the breach between the seven church ages, paragraph 100, the word of God says he's lost all so his inheritance. speaking of Adam when he lost his fellowship and right to his life. Remember the day you eat thereof that day you'll die. &gt;&gt; And when he lost his life he also lost his inheritance in life because he had completely supreme control of the earth. I stress that &gt;&gt; he had completely or complete control of the earth. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Vanom said, "Amen." That when the seals were open, it placed us back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Before the fall. &gt;&gt; Now, understand what I'm saying because I'm not speaking religion today. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have a lot of religion around this message. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about religion. I'm talking about life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This message, as I said earlier, come to change you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From glory to glory. &gt;&gt; Your level of worship &gt;&gt; will increase. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With your revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Is that the truth? &gt;&gt; Yeah. And as it increase, &gt;&gt; it changes you. It changes everything about you or or the part of you you thought you knew. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because you have a change that's going on in you. &gt;&gt; How could I say it? You've never walked this way before. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We constantly call oursel, "Oh, ye are gods." We don't even know what that is. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah. But as we progress, &gt;&gt; as we move forward, all nature, nature must respect us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; It's not something that you got to say, hey, when you got to respect me. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; It honors you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Whether you understand it or not, I don't even understand the intelligence of w intelligence of wind. &gt;&gt; That's right. But the wind must re obey you. &gt;&gt; You say, "Okay, what what do you say?" If the if the real Adam, the first Adam would say to the wind, "Stop." &gt;&gt; I don't know how the wind hears. &gt;&gt; But the wind has to obey. &gt;&gt; I'm [clears throat] not talking about something I haven't experienced. Many of have of of us have seen how we've prayed and God turned the storm around. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That wasn't um us figuring it out. I I don't know how it works. &gt;&gt; But I know that one thing God has given the bride of Jesus Christ. That is the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Now, we realize the spoken word is not given to children. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You must come to a maturity. &gt;&gt; Amen. In order for God to trust you with the spoken word, you can't just feel like I want to speak. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Everything is moving by the power of God. &gt;&gt; Everything is moving. &gt;&gt; And so realize by the grace of God that even though you can't see him, &gt;&gt; you may not even be able to feel him, but he's there. &gt;&gt; Amen. And once you receive the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; this is what I tell my people or tell the people in Iowa. Shame on you when you feel like you lonely. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz God said, &gt;&gt; "I'll never leave you." &gt;&gt; Nor will I forsake you. &gt;&gt; So if you feeling lonely, it's because you have accepted some negative thoughts &gt;&gt; and those thoughts are not of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Bible said in the presence [screaming] of the Lord, &gt;&gt; there's fullness of joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when I see people that are not full of joy, &gt;&gt; they're lacking. &gt;&gt; Somewhere in their lives, they're not consecrated like they should be. Oh, come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; It's real. &gt;&gt; It's real. &gt;&gt; And then you see some Christians, they just happy all the time. Guarantee you they got they have a prayer life, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They read their word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not that they're not battled, &gt;&gt; but they know how to cast down &gt;&gt; evil imaginations &gt;&gt; because they realize Amen. As Christ's word comes to give us life, &gt;&gt; the devil's word comes to give bring death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, let me keep let me go on. I'm sorry. I'm getting a little stirred. When we see by God's grace that Adam had completely control of the earth, &gt;&gt; he was good. He was God of the earth. God is the God of the universe everywhere. But his son had this earth under his own control. He could speak. He could name. He could say, he could stop nature. He could do anything he wanted to. See, but when he did that, he lost his inheritance. &gt;&gt; Now, I I want to say this, it's just amazing to me because the more spiritual you become, the more you begin to connect with the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; This is why it's so important to think on &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't have my Bible with me, but you know that that is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word, the word was with God, and the word was God. God is God is God is his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, when we begin to think on the words of God, what word are we thinking on? Amen. &gt;&gt; If you were with him before the beginning, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; If you were with him when he said, "Let there be." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The very [screaming] words in the book, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; are your words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; the Bible is not separated from the the the the people of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? I'm I'm not talking about your flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm talking about that soul that has the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is one with the word. &gt;&gt; But God wants our minds, &gt;&gt; hear what I'm saying. The greatest battle that is fought &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; is truly in your mind. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why? Why in your mind today? Because we realize by the grace of God, your mind, whatever you receive in your mind leaves your mind and it goes down and it creates something. &gt;&gt; Whatever it creates is what you become. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now, God is looking for a wife. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whose mind will be stayed on him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So she can't afford &gt;&gt; to allow her [screaming] mind to be distracted. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; With something other than her husband. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, that's what Eve did. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; She let her mind be extracted. Distracted &gt;&gt; from Adam. &gt;&gt; By way of reasoning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the devil taught her some science. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hello. Which is what we are battling right now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We battle science versus God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I I'm telling you something here this morning. &gt;&gt; You know, I I I said, Lord, I I really appreciate, you know, uh, Brother Tra Chad inviting us, and I'm What is that these people don't know, [laughter] but I thank God because of the teachings and all that you have. &gt;&gt; But I want to reiterate, &gt;&gt; I want to remind you, of who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? Because we know that once we come to understand who we are, &gt;&gt; we become an invincible army. &gt;&gt; See, I have a goal. &gt;&gt; And my goal is to be completely surrendered. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To his will. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So much so that I look so much like him, &gt;&gt; I would be able to pull him out of heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. You hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; See, if we all adapt that type of attitude, &gt;&gt; you put us together. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, this is this church is not defeated. &gt;&gt; You ask me, I'm saying we just begun. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Satan is mad. &gt;&gt; He see you changing &gt;&gt; and he can't stop you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's trying to hold you up. Can I say it? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's trying to hold you up with social media. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh my god." Tick tock, tick tock. The time is running out. [laughter] &gt;&gt; And while you're up there looking at stuff, listen, y'all know I'm telling you the truth. &gt;&gt; You You tap on one thing. &gt;&gt; Yes. And the next uh uh uh thing you know, a whole hour has passed. &gt;&gt; And you haven't received anything from God. &gt;&gt; And you get away from that kind of a thing. [screaming] All you have is depression, &gt;&gt; oppression, &gt;&gt; all [screaming] of the things that Satan can give you as a gift. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But if [screaming] you turn your mind toward Jesus, &gt;&gt; turn your mind toward the word and think on these things. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; y'all hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Because we understand that when brother Brandham &gt;&gt; was here, he told us to watch and look at the rock. Look at that unwritten word. &gt;&gt; You got to meditate on it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because can I say it like this? Even the message in book form &gt;&gt; has to come to you as a revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You can read it, but you can't understand it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until the Holy Spirit brings the revelation to you of what it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm so happy about that. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; because it's Jesus Christ who gives us a revelation. &gt;&gt; You don't get it on your own. &gt;&gt; You can't learn this. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. This come by revelation. &gt;&gt; And you and I ought to be so grateful &gt;&gt; that God chooses you &gt;&gt; to be a vessel. &gt;&gt; And you know what? The devil is mad with me &gt;&gt; cuz when I was his, &gt;&gt; I did everything he wanted me to do, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And probably and some, as they say. But when God saved me, &gt;&gt; nobody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You hear? Nobody. Since I've been saved, I've never had a desire to turn back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even when I didn't understand, &gt;&gt; there was never anything in me &gt;&gt; that wanted to turn back. &gt;&gt; And I'm [screaming] not talking down to those who turn back. That's your position. &gt;&gt; God had to do that for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the joy [screaming] of returning &gt;&gt; is greater than the joy you thought you had when you left. &gt;&gt; So God [screaming] knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm no better than you and you know better than I am. &gt;&gt; Oh, didn't he have too many amens on that one? &gt;&gt; But it is the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can I say it like this? The only super race &gt;&gt; is God's race. [applause] &gt;&gt; Those of us who have his DNA, &gt;&gt; that's what makes us a special class of people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Satan purpose from Eden was to make his own self and Eden &gt;&gt; and exalt himself above so the stars of God would worship him. That's right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sons would worship him. &gt;&gt; And he was absolutely carried it out now. And he has absolutely carried it out now. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Y. &gt;&gt; Y'all know that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And And I'm [clears throat] going to say this because I've learned that you have to be careful &gt;&gt; in everything you do &gt;&gt; cuz Satan can slip in. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if you're not watchful, &gt;&gt; you'll find yourself worshiping him &gt;&gt; than worshiping God. &gt;&gt; Oh, y'all quiet on that. &gt;&gt; But it's nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; I love music. &gt;&gt; I love to worship. &gt;&gt; But I've been in places. I'm not talking about denominations. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about message churches and message people. And when it flips, they don't even know the difference. It starts out worshiping God &gt;&gt; and then it flips. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; and they don't know it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But God has [screaming] designed me differently. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Oh my God. I know the difference &gt;&gt; because [screaming] of who I am &gt;&gt; and whose I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can I say it like this? I even told my church, if God don't let Elvis get away with it, &gt;&gt; he ain't going to let you get away with it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can't be worshiping God, moving like Elvis. &gt;&gt; Hello. I don't care if they saying Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's another Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brooks, &gt;&gt; hush your mouth. &gt;&gt; But I know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I've [screaming] left I've left Oh, man. I've left places, you know, go my go I go to my uh uh hotel room just absolutely cry &gt;&gt; because I said, "Lord, they don't see it." That's right. &gt;&gt; And I know I look like I'm an oddball right now, but wherever I go, where whatever I do, y'all know I sing, but I go to worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only one God, and that's the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I have to become somebody's enemy, then so be it. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is this all right? &gt;&gt; And he has absolutely carried it out now. And when he's done this and brought it into the church, what do you mean? Whenever and I don't mean to talk about music, but here I am. Whenever music is above the [screaming] words of the music, &gt;&gt; it's no longer God. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Music comes to compliment, &gt;&gt; not to take over. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me get off this because I have a lot of people texting me after a while. &gt;&gt; But we know by the grace of God that our strength comes from truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible said that it is the truth &gt;&gt; that will make you free. &gt;&gt; Not not set you free, make you free. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, let me move on. &gt;&gt; He said we're living in and it's Satan's that done it through educational programs. Better fit, better this, better that, &gt;&gt; and not knowing all the time. They're walking right straight into death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blinded leading the blind. Blinded leaders of the nation. Blinded leaders of science, blind leaders of the church, blind leaders of the blinded. Jesus said, "Let them alone. They will both fall in the ditch." &gt;&gt; Now, that's that's that's powerful. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you got to understand, we come to do something. It's not going to get better. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, somebody. Oh, we're living in the land of the free. No, we're not. No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those days are over with. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whether you understand it or not, Christians, you are the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But God has to do it this way. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because we're too laxed. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; God has to put some pressure on us &gt;&gt; to bring us to the place where we should be. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It is the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, he wanders. I got to hurry because I know I'm taking too much time. &gt;&gt; He said, now coming from the seven church ages exposition. He said, remember this, and you've heard this quote over and over again. Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; But the book of Revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Making it lukewarm, formal, powerless. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, we we didn't I didn't understand why people just don't seem to want to worship God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. And I'm just maybe on the little fanatical side, you know, cuz I get I get on people, you know, when they just want to just raise one hand, &gt;&gt; bring that witness up. [laughter] You know what I'm saying? I don't understand that. when God is being so good to you. &gt;&gt; He said the book of Revelation shows how that the antichrist would come into the church and defile it, making it lukewarm, formal, [screaming] powerless. &gt;&gt; It it exposes Satan. Can I say this? We are not supposed to become powerless &gt;&gt; as we move toward this great translation. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we supposed to become more and more and more like him. &gt;&gt; And this power I'm talking about is authority. &gt;&gt; When you know that you know that you know that you know that you got Jesus on the inside, &gt;&gt; it drives [screaming] away all the fear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The bride, she's not trembling in [screaming] fear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She's standing strong in confidence. Is that right? &gt;&gt; This message gives you confidence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] When you realize, Amen. that the grace of God got you covered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I make mistakes, brother. &gt;&gt; But God [screaming] got me covered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When I fall [screaming] or come short, &gt;&gt; you know who picks me up? &gt;&gt; Not my next old neighbor, but God himself. How many times you have been troubled and all of a sudden a hymn breaks in your mind? &gt;&gt; You think that comes from the devil? &gt;&gt; That comes from God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And and and I'm loving it. I'm loving every bit of this walk. &gt;&gt; Every stumble, every fall, every failure, I look back and I see where he brought me from. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I can say this morning, he's brought me from a mighty long way. We've heard it. &gt;&gt; You know, I get excited. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I don't mind &gt;&gt; cuz he likes it. &gt;&gt; But let me go on by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the book of Revelation shows the Antichrist spirit while he comes in church devou making it more formal and powerless. It exposes Satan. What are you saying? &gt;&gt; You got all these message believers &gt;&gt; and you say, "Give me a roar. Roar. Y'all know it's true. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; And And we we we don't take note that something's wrong in the house. &gt;&gt; Am I right or wrong? &gt;&gt; All I know is that when John, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; saw his name, Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When he saw his name, there was no no quiet moment. &gt;&gt; He began to scream. He began to shout. He began to praise God. [screaming] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Something on the inside. See, that's what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; When it comes to your worship, &gt;&gt; your worship is built upon your revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you got a real revelation of who you are, where you [screaming] came from, and where you're going, hallelujah, God has set you up for praise. &gt;&gt; God set you up for worship. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Because that's the throne &gt;&gt; that Satan wanted. &gt;&gt; He wanted people to worship him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; And that's the throne. It's not a chair. &gt;&gt; It's a position. Y'all hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; And if God said if you overcome, &gt;&gt; I let you sat in my throne &gt;&gt; even as I've sat in my father's throne. &gt;&gt; What is he saying? I'm giving you the position. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The same position Adam had. Somebody help me here. There was not [screaming] an animal in the garden that Adam was afraid of. &gt;&gt; Why? Because in their own way they worshiped him. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah, Lord. &gt;&gt; I I saw something just the other day before I came. &gt;&gt; I first got a little small car. Where was the SUV? But it was too small for me and my wife to it was too, you know, close, too, &gt;&gt; you know, SUV, you want some room in it, right? &gt;&gt; And I drove back and then I knew I found out my daughter and and and my grandson want to go so come. So I I took the car back and I had a brother say to me, "That man won't God going to give that man eternal life." I said, "What?" He said, "Not only that man going to be good to you, he ain't going to charge you nothing extra." Something like that. And he going to give you a what? What? A minivan. &gt;&gt; I had no plan. I I made the reservation to fa same day [snorts] &gt;&gt; and the man did the same exactly. He did the exact thing &gt;&gt; the brother said he was going to do. &gt;&gt; A car like this &gt;&gt; versus a car like that. &gt;&gt; Same amount. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Can I I'm just going to tell you how much it was. &gt;&gt; $200. &gt;&gt; For three days. &gt;&gt; Long distance. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? [laughter] God did that. &gt;&gt; I told him, "Brother," I said, "See, he he believes in that kind of thing. You speak it, God will honor it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you led by the spirit, &gt;&gt; you're not talking negative stuff. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything out of your mouth is positive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Y'all remember I told you my testimony, I think, when I had that cancer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And everybody says, "Well, I had somebody say, "But what if?" What if? That ain't in my vocabulary. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It ain't what if. [screaming] &gt;&gt; God has already done it. &gt;&gt; That's how the bride speaks. &gt;&gt; We don't do whatifs. &gt;&gt; We are people of authority. &gt;&gt; We're sitting in the throne. Yes. &gt;&gt; You said, "Oh, when I get over yonder." Well, that ain't the way the prophet said it. &gt;&gt; If he said that the opening of the word has brought us back to the place where Adam before he fell, &gt;&gt; Adam was in [screaming] the throne. &gt;&gt; He was the king on earth. Oh, come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; And everything on earth had to obey him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; My wife and I were coming down and they were talking about snowstorms. She and I prayed. Hallelujah. It's like God opened up the way. &gt;&gt; We didn't have no snowstorm. We had nothing. &gt;&gt; Even coming through the Chicago where all the traffic is, God moved that out the way, too. &gt;&gt; Y'all better hear what I'm saying. What I'm saying is we are we [screaming] live by our testimonies. &gt;&gt; Everything God works with you, he working to bring a testimony. &gt;&gt; And like I tell people, you can't have a testimony if there's no test. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I'm I'm [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Let me move on. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to finish this quote. &gt;&gt; But we [snorts] understand by the grace of God. He fights that. He fights the word and you are the word. &gt;&gt; He fights you. You don't have Oh Lord, why? Why? Why? What you mean why? &gt;&gt; Yeah. You've chosen the harder way. &gt;&gt; You think you're going to go sweeping through the city? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You come to be tried. &gt;&gt; You come to be tested. &gt;&gt; As as we say, you come to prove that you're not from Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And in this proving, I I don't know. I'm so I can't even get it out like I really want to. &gt;&gt; But I have [screaming] a joy unspeakable. Now, do I get a little, you know, my flesh sometime? Absolutely. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But there's a place in me &gt;&gt; Satan can't touch. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? &gt;&gt; He may rattle the curtains a little bit, &gt;&gt; but he can't shake up the house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because on the inside of the inside, it's not just a God, it's the God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; The Almighty God, the God who made heaven and earth, the God who [screaming] made everything, the God who made you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You think he he's Yeah, he's in here. &gt;&gt; I I'm trusting he's in you, sir. &gt;&gt; But I know he's in here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you you know what? God will always make things happen in your life &gt;&gt; to bring you back to the revelation &gt;&gt; that I never left you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm always with you. &gt;&gt; I promise I never leave you, nor will I forsake you. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it has nothing to do with my feelings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Like I was telling somebody the other day, and I'm I'm I'm going to finish this quote. [laughter] &gt;&gt; But my point is this. [snorts] None of us are worthy. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; If I came down and say, "Here, have $100,000." The first one that comes up to the front, you know what'll happen? It'll be a stampede, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I might even be one in the line. [laughter] But my point is, it's given to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember when somebody gave me my first 12. It was a 12 gauge bicycle from Europe &gt;&gt; and I showed it off. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I didn't say, "Oh, this bicycle was given to me. Ain't it pretty?" Uh-uh. I got on it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I rode it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I was glad when people said, "Well, where did you get that bike from?" [laughter] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How did you get it? It was a gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, what I'm trying to say is God has given you eternal life &gt;&gt; and you're just setting it up on the shelf. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Oh, this is my eternal life. This is my little box. It's not that. It's not given to you for that reason. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God wants that light to shine. &gt;&gt; God don't care if you look like a fool. &gt;&gt; Everybody usually ones who follow God, they that's what they look like. They look crazy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God wants somebody who's not ashamed of him. &gt;&gt; The bride is [screaming] not ashamed. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Oh, we done got too pretty. &gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of folks pretty. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; You come to church and you don't even want to mess up your hair. One time we didn't care. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Here's a time we didn't care. &gt;&gt; Sisters, you say that's Pentecostal, aren't you? &gt;&gt; See what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; You've heard somebody say you're not Pentecostals. Yes, you are by birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By birth, you are. If you ain't Pentecostal by birth, you better get it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And all I can say is the Pentecostal, the real Pentecostals have a certain way they act. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Cuz brother B said, "No matter where I go, [screaming] &gt;&gt; if if they're filled with the Holy Ghost, they act the same way." [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I was at a meeting years ago and they were setting people down cuz they got excited. I said, "Oh my God, please don't let them touch me cuz they going to think I got a demon. Ain't nobody going to stop me from worshiping God." Now, &gt;&gt; this ain't about you and me. It's about me and him, &gt;&gt; right? So, my my point is I you can't allow yourself to get cooled off.

Some of y'all sir, &gt;&gt; still struggling. &gt;&gt; But I don't like that funny feeling. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't like it when people got me in prison &gt;&gt; and they enjoying their freedom. Y'all hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; So I kept crying out to the Lord, "Help me, Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he did. &gt;&gt; And right now, I would do anything for that brother. &gt;&gt; Big, [screaming] small, it doesn't matter. I won't even think about it because you know what? Love don't think. &gt;&gt; Love acts. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now, let me move on by the grace of God. I love the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and so you understand that this this this position that God is taking us through. Y'all believe it. &gt;&gt; It it's not going to be many. &gt;&gt; But I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; And And you got to realize, Amen. By the grace of God that it's already done. &gt;&gt; The victory is yours. &gt;&gt; It's already done. Yes. &gt;&gt; And all God is trying to tell you is to enjoy your salvation.

[laughter] Wow. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you know, it's amazing. And I don't mean no harm, but No, let me say it. Yeah, I'm going to say it. &gt;&gt; It It's so [screaming] amazing how we're in the message and the skirts are getting shorter. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I say, "Oh, what's this? &gt;&gt; What's this?" &gt;&gt; Why you wearing [screaming] them shorter? &gt;&gt; That's right. If you're not trying to show your legs, &gt;&gt; well, I'm not trying to show my legs. I said, then why are you shaving them? &gt;&gt; You're not only shaving them, but you greasing them up or lo, whatever you call it. But my point is, you know, you're being a hypocrite &gt;&gt; all these years and nothing has changed. This word will never change &gt;&gt; when it comes to holiness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I'm I'm impressed &gt;&gt; by what I see here. So, keep it up. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you know your brother you're your brother's keeper. &gt;&gt; So, that means that when you see somebody going wrong, you got to help him stay saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; At least get the appearance that they are. &gt;&gt; So, you understand by the gra is is that right? &gt;&gt; Well, if I say something to brother so and so, he going to say he going to get mad. Let him get mad &gt;&gt; down the road. [screaming] He'll appreciate it.

How many of y'all believe this message with all your heart? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that itself is a seal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't believe the word full word with all your heart without a seal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What you say, brother? I didn't speak in time. I didn't jump. I didn't. You don't have to do all of that. &gt;&gt; Even though that's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you, &gt;&gt; it's good when I can dance. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't happen all the time. &gt;&gt; And I don't base my salvation on how many times I dance. I got it. &gt;&gt; I have seen and I don't mean I'm not boasting, but let me I &gt;&gt; I'm going the way the spirit is leading me. &gt;&gt; I have I have I have seen probably more miracles in this message than most of you have. &gt;&gt; But I'm not I'm no fool. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the children of Israel saw a lot of miracles, sir. &gt;&gt; And they were lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Supernatural. [screaming] I've seen it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I've even had tell message people say, "Well, you ain't never seen the pillar of fire." I said, "Well, you weren't there." &gt;&gt; Don't tell me what I didn't see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I know this doctrine say you don't see it, but I saw something &gt;&gt; and it looked just like what I saw &gt;&gt; or have seen. Y'all understand what I [laughter] said? &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; it it's real. But people will try to take that from you. &gt;&gt; Yes, it will. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] Now, &gt;&gt; how can I say it? &gt;&gt; Let me Yo, yo, coming to church, it's good. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But that's not what save you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to know him. Amen. &gt;&gt; You you you you see Christians that you know you you you going back forth all the time here and there. That means you haven't crossed over. &gt;&gt; There's some unbelief in you somewhere. &gt;&gt; And God want to take that unbelief out of you. &gt;&gt; You'll never understand this message if you don't see the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear me? &gt;&gt; That's why it's not taste not, touch not, handle not. It's none of that. Praise God. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? In heaven, there will never be a bulletin board. &gt;&gt; Listing all the dos and the don'ts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not there. &gt;&gt; Because the character of Christ &gt;&gt; is what rules heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God, think about this. God [screaming] has invited you &gt;&gt; to be partaker &gt;&gt; of his divine nature. &gt;&gt; Can I say it like this? There is no other [screaming] divine nature outside of God's nature. &gt;&gt; So if you take in the nature of God, you take in God. [cheering] &gt;&gt; And that's why he call you [screaming] God's. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you say, "Oh my God, I I need some patience." &gt;&gt; And you even afraid to ask for it, &gt;&gt; cuz you know what? You know you're going to get some tribulation. &gt;&gt; What you give it to me, &gt;&gt; whatever I'm lacking, &gt;&gt; no matter what I go through. And this is what I tell my church. I say here in Revelation 3, he you invited Is that right? &gt;&gt; Gold [screaming] tried in the fire. &gt;&gt; You don't mind being gold. Thank God for the deity. &gt;&gt; But you don't want the fire. &gt;&gt; Oh, you going to get it. &gt;&gt; Whether you ask for it or not, you getting it. &gt;&gt; And if you are truly the sons and daughters of God, you must go through the fire. &gt;&gt; Cuz God got to get all that trash, all that. Come on, y'all. You know, you I I I say it like this. You thought you was already all right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Until you come to this message. &gt;&gt; And when you come to this message, it begins to work. &gt;&gt; Move all into dark places you didn't even know you had. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It finds you [screaming] out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But the strength of this message is humility. &gt;&gt; Humble [screaming] yourself. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because if you humble yourself, he will exalt you in due time. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. I I you know, we don't know how to be humble. Some of us, we just don't know how to be humble. [snorts] &gt;&gt; But God knows how to make you. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you. I'm sorry, pastor. I'm just every I'm feel like I'm everywhere. &gt;&gt; But but you know, my my point is this. You know, &gt;&gt; you have you are the most blessed people &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; on earth. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You ever thought why Cain killed Abel? &gt;&gt; Because he had a revelation of the lamb. &gt;&gt; And the devil has been mad ever since. &gt;&gt; And he's tried to stop the revelation of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Because he knew there were going to come a real lamb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That would literally, Amen. take away everything he did. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? Amen. &gt;&gt; He done worked and built the kingdom &gt;&gt; and here come the blood of the real lamb. &gt;&gt; That will destroy [screaming] everything. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He made &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And so we realize by the grace of God as we come through the church ages, &gt;&gt; they didn't know Jesus like we know him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they could only worship him in a partiality, a partial way. You understand me? It was according to their revelation. &gt;&gt; And when we came to the day of Pentecost, we thought it had we had it all. &gt;&gt; Anybody else was Pentecostals? Hey, &gt;&gt; we thought we had it all. &gt;&gt; It was a disappr. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And was better &gt;&gt; and greater than what you had. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you realize, Amen, that you didn't have to fast so much. &gt;&gt; You know, y'all know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Some of y'all don't know what fasting is. But back in the Pentecostal church, you was made to fast. &gt;&gt; Certain days of the week in my church, you had to fast no matter how hungry you was. &gt;&gt; But the message came &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. and showed us it wasn't by works. &gt;&gt; It was by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Y'all hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; And then we come to come to see, amen, that this whole thing has been by grace. &gt;&gt; Not because you did this or did that. &gt;&gt; It's because he elected elected you, &gt;&gt; chose you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even that was by grace. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you come to see these things and you say, "Well, praise the Y'all know what I'm saying." It sets you free. &gt;&gt; I don't know whether you know what I'm talking about, &gt;&gt; but it set you free &gt;&gt; to know that if I make a mistake, the blood of Jesus got me covered. &gt;&gt; A real believer don't want to make a mistake. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Real believers don't want to hurt our brothers or our sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now. It's the truth anyway. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what God has done for this age has revealed his character. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, you can't make a mistake. &gt;&gt; Am I like Jesus &gt;&gt; or am I not? &gt;&gt; Here's his character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here are you. Here is you. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. You got to measure it up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? is like here. &gt;&gt; That's how it works. &gt;&gt; You got to be just like him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And none of us can [screaming] accomplish it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not one of us can add a cubit to our statue. &gt;&gt; So, how [screaming] are we going to get there? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; By the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I believe the blood of Jesus Christ. I believe the word of God. He that begun the good working will will what? Complete it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] And don't worry about making a rapture cuz I am the rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When he filled me with his Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He gave me the down payment. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what [screaming] I'm saying? &gt;&gt; So, let me say it like this. Teach us how to pray. He said, "Let thy will be done &gt;&gt; in earth as it is in heaven." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It ain't quiet up there. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They're not quiet [screaming] up there. &gt;&gt; Oh, see, y'all done got quiet now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But up there, &gt;&gt; is that right? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it like this. The earth here in this third dimension is the quietest place between heaven and hell. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he said, if you can't stand loud noises, right? &gt;&gt; He said, if you get up there, you'll freeze to death. Yes. &gt;&gt; Because people, the joy of the Lord is your strength. &gt;&gt; That's why the devil attacks your joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he can seize you or sees your joy, he know he's got you pinned down. &gt;&gt; Ah, I I tell you, I tell you, it's amazing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen. And he said before he reveals his characteristics of the last age to us, he gives us one final look at his gracious and supreme deity. Who do you think he talking about? &gt;&gt; One last [screaming] look. &gt;&gt; It this is not going to repeat. &gt;&gt; This is it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, even your prophet of God got so excited he ran around a tree. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Scaring all the animals. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm just saying. &gt;&gt; Sometime it runs over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know me, sometimes the pot do you know it does. It runs over. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see, and I hope I don't fear nobody by saying this. I love grits. And grits, you got to keep an eye on it. &gt;&gt; When you cook grits, you can't just say, "Okay, I'mma turn the eye on and then I'll go over here." No, no, no. It'll be popping everywhere. I love grits cuz, you know, it reminds me of a real revival. You put the heat on it, don't care where it pop pop. [laughter] &gt;&gt; You almost have to jump out the way so it won't burn you. I'm sorry, brother. &gt;&gt; I just come to be a blessing this morning. &gt;&gt; That's all. &gt;&gt; Listen, the exposition of the seven church age, he says before he revealed the characteristics of the last age to us, he gives us one final look at his own gracious supreme deity. This is the capstone relation of himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thus said the amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus the amen of God. Jesus is the go. So so let it be of God. Amen stands for finality. I I don't know about you sir &gt;&gt; but I am the amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say brother Brooks if you're not there are you there yet? &gt;&gt; It all depends where you're looking from. Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; If you're looking from earth, I'm not there yet. &gt;&gt; If you're looking from heaven, I'm already there. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And one of these old days, we getting ready to to unite in such a way we will change d Oh, come on. We'll change dimensions. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. I was telling my church, I said, "If God told John to come uph come up higher, &gt;&gt; you got to come up higher." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can't get this revelation and understand it being carnal. &gt;&gt; You got to [screaming] come up higher. &gt;&gt; You got to change that mention or let the dimension change you &gt;&gt; because Amen. the revelation comes from there. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And drops into your heart. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The greatest revelation of my time &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; is to know that Christ is in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. All the other revelations of uh you know go through Genesis all of that and I can I got stuff in my notes. But let me say it like this. He said in that day &gt;&gt; you know that I'm in the father &gt;&gt; the father's in me &gt;&gt; and I am in you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you right now, which I wouldn't want it happen, but if I drop dead right now, &gt;&gt; I know where I'm going. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; I didn't say I hope. I said I know &gt;&gt; where I'm going. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of assurance we need. &gt;&gt; That's what gives us strength. &gt;&gt; Can I testify just a minute? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I normally walk around my neighborhood, you know, a little exercise and I was had brother Brandham on my headset and I'm just walking [snorts] and uh whether it be vision, whatever it was, I saw this dog and the dog, it was vision, okay? I saw this in a vision, a dog, big old German shepherd coming at me. And you know when you're in a vision, you don't know it. right? &gt;&gt; You're just seeing things and sometimes you think it's just your imagination. &gt;&gt; But here I was having this vision and um and and but the the voice said to me when this happened, "Stand still." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And just as I turned, didn't even know the neighbor had a German Shepherd. This dog was huge. Looked like it was mixed with wolf or something. It was so big. It was so big. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he was coming straight at me with his mouth all open like he's going to tear me up and his and and his owner whoever was keeping like so and so like talking to a dog like a human. What did he do to you? He didn't do nothing to you. Why you charging? You know, I'm like standing still. But I was listening and I was watching this dog. God is my witness. When the dog came close to me, he got confused. He circled me like this &gt;&gt; and then he ran back to his master. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now that was God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I was on a plane. Did I tell you about the plane trip? &gt;&gt; American Airline. That don't don't buy cop, but it was American airline. Right. And we were going I was flying we flying towards Chicago in the winter. had already ascended into uh 30,000 milei we you know but prior to that they were having trouble with the plane. &gt;&gt; Now I'm telling you this because these are the things that God expect us &gt;&gt; expect to happen to us things that we can testify &gt;&gt; this is God &gt;&gt; and and while I was out here again now I'm I'm listening to brother Brandon &gt;&gt; Amen. And the one of the flight attendants, she she break her thought or train of thought with some of these people and she comes and she said, "What is that?" And I I didn't know what she was looking at. She said, "That light." She she stuttered because she didn't want to say I still didn't pay her no attention. Then after a while, Amen. They called her back and says, "Okay, we're in trouble. The plane is in trouble." So she come back trying, you know how they do. They're trying to be calm. &gt;&gt; They're not calm. You can see it in their eyes. &gt;&gt; They're trying to be calm. Say, "We're having trouble. We're going to have to land somewhere." And there's the question. People said, "Well, where are we going to land?" Cuz if you look out the window, all you saw was snow. [snorts] And uh to make it short, I said, "Oh, God." I said, "You didn't tell me I was going to die today." cuz I really believe that when my time comes, he going to tell me. &gt;&gt; I don't believe I'm going away in secret. &gt;&gt; Unless it's the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if I die otherwise, he going to tell me. I believe that for some reason. I know he will. &gt;&gt; And anyway, uh I was seriously scared. &gt;&gt; Y'all weren't expecting that one, right? [laughter] A fear caught me. It's like something was choking me to death. Wow. &gt;&gt; I couldn't breathe. &gt;&gt; Right. Then I heard something say, "Perfect love cast out fear." &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; As soon as it said that fear left. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I look at that stewardist flight attendant. I say, "It's going to be all right." And she said, "Okay, okay." And she was at peace from that point onise. &gt;&gt; And when we got to the we you know what it did circle back to the to the airport. They had the fire trucks. They had the ambulance. They had all every all the equipment just in case there was a crash. &gt;&gt; And she warn us, don't don't get too excited. I'm thinking to myself, don't get excited. But the point is, you was excited, but you don't want us to get excited. But anyway, when we landed, I thought, "Wow, what an opportunity to talk to this lady." &gt;&gt; Well, got in the terminal. Lady didn't want to talk to me. &gt;&gt; See, that's how quick it comes and goes. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? She saw God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But she didn't really want him after she got back on the land. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm like, Lord, what is that? &gt;&gt; It's just like the 10 lepers. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Some the ones who was healed only what, one, two came back to say, "Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; See, that's how it is. &gt;&gt; You know, but we have a testimony &gt;&gt; that somebody who was and maybe down the road she'll be saved. I don't know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the point is, Amen. By the grace of God, God wants to use you. &gt;&gt; But you think that your these things of tragedy has come to you to destroy you. No. It comes to build you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You're the Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, it's true. It's true. It's true. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's so true. And and um [snorts and clears throat] I'm coming I'm almost done, but I'mma I'm coming back to the mind. I'mma close with this in your mind. Is this okay, pastor? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. I don't want to take too long cuz I know I do. But uh I want you to protect your mind. &gt;&gt; I came to say that because uh this message has to be ingested, as I said, and digested. And you've got to bring it here. And that's what we do when we eat. You know, like we know that uh you know uh Adam didn't eat an apple. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he ingested the information and he acted it out. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And and when you take this message, you got to take it personally. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, like you're not looking at God was talking to somebody in 1963. God is talking to me &gt;&gt; right now. Yes. &gt;&gt; And when you start taking it like that, it seemed how it changes you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Am I making sense? &gt;&gt; I could not have changed myself. &gt;&gt; And and when I came to the message, guess what? I was still broken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Anybody can witness. I was still broken. &gt;&gt; It was this message that mended me. God through this message mended me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Fix me if I could say it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Did it come through struggles? Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Heartbreaks. &gt;&gt; No. People are or you know God has ordained people to upset you. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; You say I don't have no enemy. Well, I'm going to tell you something. Before you get out of here, God going to give you enemies. You need enemies. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know, I I don't mean to be funny. I'm not trying to be, but it's true. &gt;&gt; You need somebody to dislike you. &gt;&gt; That's when you know you got the real thing. &gt;&gt; That you can even love the unlovable. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. People who look at you and then you know in their eyes they're cutting you down. &gt;&gt; Oh, y'all don't know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Yes. in this message. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, y'all don't know Sister Sanctified. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The more religious they are, &gt;&gt; the more mean and evil. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't mean to step on nobody toe, but I just did, I guess. &gt;&gt; But my point is, Amen. Your religion is not going to save you. &gt;&gt; You got to be born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother Brooks, that ain't deep enough." Okay. &gt;&gt; Ephesians the first chapter &gt;&gt; and I'm going bring it to an end. But I find out that your mind, y'all, how how many times you've gotten disgusted with yourself? Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you allowed yourself to put too much time into nonsense. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; The devil knows what he's doing now. He He's a smart fella. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he knows that God wants your mind. See, everything that God wants for you, the devil wants it for his own purpose, too. &gt;&gt; And he knows if he can get your mind, he's he's he's literally holding you up. He cannot stop you, &gt;&gt; but he can hold you up. &gt;&gt; And uh so the mind is so important. And you know, I'm praying. I'm always praying, Lord, help me. Help me. Help me. Keep my mind stayed on you. Keep my mind stayed on you. &gt;&gt; One way or the other. If it's not songs, let it be praises. If it's not praises, that you say, "What? What kind of life [screaming] is that?" &gt;&gt; The kind I'm going to live in heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you can't enjoy it here, you won't enjoy it there. &gt;&gt; All y'all talk about is Jesus. Hello. What are you going to talk about when you get up there? &gt;&gt; There ain't going to be no Fox and no CNN and all that nonsense. &gt;&gt; Everything will work. It be worship. &gt;&gt; It'll be praise. &gt;&gt; It'll be a life. &gt;&gt; You'll be working and you still have your mind on Jesus. Everything you do will be because of him. &gt;&gt; Yes. You'll be doing things that, you know, you're not going to be sitting up in no big lounge chair. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; No, you going to be doing some stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Think about it. I think about those ceream chair all they saying holy, holy, holy. You know, and you think, well, you know, that's typed. You know what I mean? But the point is, &gt;&gt; they don't seem to get tired. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And a true Christian don't get tired of worshiping God. &gt;&gt; Oh man, I got to go to church again. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; you going to go to church again. And I'm going to tell you something. I I tell my church, you know, I I I test them sometime cuz, you know, I could have church every day. &gt;&gt; Seriously. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Tired or not, I can have church every day. In the apostolic church, that's what it was almost anyway. They always had something going on and you always had to be there if you were spiritual. &gt;&gt; Yeah. When I say I can have church all every day, they get quiet. Well, how I'm going to do this? Well, I don't know. But I can have church every day. I'm the preacher. &gt;&gt; And I mean that. I don't have problem with church. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Having service I don't &gt;&gt; if it wasn't for CO we'd have &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; CO took one of my services. &gt;&gt; I still haven't gotten over it yet. &gt;&gt; Nobody fought for it, brother. They didn't fight. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; I was expecting somebody said, "No, Brother Brooks, don't cancel service." Not one person. &gt;&gt; So I was disappointed. I go with what the people want. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. First Ephesians 1:17. I don't want to grieve you, but that's &gt;&gt; that that amazes me. &gt;&gt; Can I y'all have prayer service here? &gt;&gt; How many people show up? &gt;&gt; Don't Don't Yeah. Oh, but I love the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what they say. &gt;&gt; I love the Lord. And you can't even talk to him. &gt;&gt; I don't mean to scone you, but my point is something's wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Y'all don't think I know what I'm talking about. Brothers and sisters, when y'all first fell in love, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's all you thought about. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's all you talk about. That's right. &gt;&gt; To your best friend. She knew when you called what you were going to talk about, &gt;&gt; that's what it was. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's It's amazing that you could be in love with God and don't talk about him that much. &gt;&gt; It &gt;&gt; I love talking about the Lord. &gt;&gt; You can ask anybody that's around me when I'm fellowshipping. I'm going to talk about Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm going to talk about the Lord cuz that's him. That's me. That's &gt;&gt; my love affair. &gt;&gt; Anyway, let's move on. I'm almost done, sir. I'm almost done. &gt;&gt; Ah, Ephesians 1. that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him, &gt;&gt; the eyes of your understanding, being enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints. And that is and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe according to the working of his what? Mighty power. &gt;&gt; He wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at the right at his own right hand in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Now I I look at this and I'm like, what is wrong with us? Lord, kill this flesh. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. kill this flesh. So these words spoken &gt;&gt; will live in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And and and then you go and you say, "What do you mean?" And you you find that Jesus prayed in John and talks about the glory that he had with the father before. &gt;&gt; And then he says, "Lord, give them this glory." &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Do you want it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My point is, Amen. It's it's your position that God elevates you to, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, we came in as a sinner saved by grace, but grace going to take me to the throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's going to take me to the position where I can say like Jesus in John 10:30. I and my father are one. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; I want It [screaming] doesn't matter whether people like me or not. Right. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to tell you that's your goal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus will take you there. &gt;&gt; But you got to want it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "You have not because you ask not." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm the kind of Christian I used to [snorts] play basketball, football, ran track, all that stuff. &gt;&gt; Don't mean to jump on nobody, &gt;&gt; but when I got saved, none of that mattered. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's just the way it was. And I look at now, I tell you what, nothing ain't going to keep you like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care what you put out there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't mean to get that way, sir. I'm sorry. But let me move on by the grace of God. You know, my I have a zeal. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; For the people &gt;&gt; because you got to overcome. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Right. &gt;&gt; Every one of us has to overcome the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the only way you can overcome is that Jesus overcome for you. &gt;&gt; And I don't mean in just your thought or your mind. It's a reality. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's a reality. And and and and and how are you going to know unless you are enlightened? &gt;&gt; Your mind has to be changed. The Bible said, "Let this mind be in you that was in Christ." He can change your mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Let me say it like this. There was a time there was certain foods that I just loved. &gt;&gt; Like cinnamon rolls. &gt;&gt; I was addicted. &gt;&gt; Chocolate. I can eat chocolate now and I can eat a cinnamon roll, but I'm not addicted. &gt;&gt; Right. There were times, amen, that I'll be at home and and and that cinnamon roll would call my name. Y'all know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; It's like something talks to you. You know, you need, you know, you and your buzz, your your your everybody, everything, your senses start smelling and tasting. &gt;&gt; And I don't mean it, but it's real. Y'all know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; And before you know it, you in your car and you're going to get that cinnamon roll. And what happens if that cinema roll is not there? But see, that's an attraction. There's something your body is attracting you to and it's calling for calling [screaming] calling you. &gt;&gt; So is the word of God. &gt;&gt; If Jesus in you, Amen. He going to call you to pray. He going to call you to read your Bible. &gt;&gt; He's going to call you to listen to the tapes. It's something that pulls you and you can't get with get away from it. &gt;&gt; It's not, oh, I'm being forced. go. It's something that calls you [screaming] and you say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God has never called me to fellowship and I was disappointed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What do you say, brothers? I'm saying the Bible said the kingdom of God is with within you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever they doing in the kingdom, I'm doing it. &gt;&gt; Praise God. That make sense? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Whatever. So, I say like this. Continue to eat the book. &gt;&gt; Continue to meditate on it. Continue to study it. You probably say, "Well, let me stop." But anyway, &gt;&gt; you need to just d you know, &gt;&gt; don't don't let it get away from you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Cuz I remember I remember when when a group of us came to the message in South Carolina, no matter where you went, you hear a tape. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometime you approach the house and you hear the voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you don't hear nothing. &gt;&gt; Is that true? &gt;&gt; There people don't they don't they don't play their tapes anymore. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; I'm not pushing tapes, but I'm saying it was that voice was what is what brought me here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the only age &gt;&gt; ever where we caught the voice of God. &gt;&gt; And that voice speaks. &gt;&gt; That voice delivers. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We're not talking about a man's voice. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the voice of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And and and I'm going tell you something. The devil, if he can get you away from it, &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. &gt;&gt; He knows eventually he's got a he he's going to trap you with a trap. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. People of God, don't let your thirst die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't don't don't do it. I don't care how busy you get. And I find out that a lot of time, you know, I people get a little bit of money. And I'm closing &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden they they got all these things they want to do &gt;&gt; and they forget who gave them the money. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's Bible said when Israel when Jessron Israel uh uh got fed, Jessron got fat, they begin to kick. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's what happens to a lot of us. This is Leodysia. This is a spirit that we we have to fight every day. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But if you stop fighting, it's going to capture you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; You know, we're not in a place where the word becomes boring. &gt;&gt; Amen. My wife is here, but she'll tell you there was a young lady in that apostolic church I thought I was interested in. Didn't know that my wife liked me at the time and she was a pretty girl. But one day in Wednesday night service, she left out. I don't know whether she thought I was going to follow or not, but I didn't. And I asked her after service, I said, "Why did you leave out?" She didn't even know in my heart. I thought this could make be a a nice wife. And she said it got boring. Guess what happened? I crossed her off the list quickly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of God, we didn't have much, but it wasn't boring. [laughter] &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. If the word is boring, [screaming] something's wrong. &gt;&gt; And to this day, she don't even know it. &gt;&gt; But I crossed her off quick. Quick. &gt;&gt; Amen. I could care less. &gt;&gt; You don't love the word, you can never love me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; I trust you were blessed. &gt;&gt; I I moved everywhere but on my sermon. [laughter] &gt;&gt; So I Hey, y'all did this. Don't blame me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us stand. &gt;&gt; There is power. Power. Wonder working power in the blood of the lamb. Oh, there is power, power, wonder working power in the pre. Say it again. There is power, power, wonder working power in the blood of the lamb. Oh, there is power.

[singing] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; That blood still reigns. It still prevail. Amen. &gt;&gt; We know it's not the literal blood, but it's the [music] life of the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That eternal life. Amen. That God, &gt;&gt; Amen. That that never fails. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We appreciate everything and we trust you were blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I um somebody needed uplifting, I guess. Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I didn't mean to sound like I was joking or anything, but uh &gt;&gt; but the truth of the matter is, you know, God [music] God loves joy. He loves he he's he he has humor. You know, he he you know, it's it's just sometime I think we get to, &gt;&gt; you know, sir, &gt;&gt; loosen up a little bit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I trust that's what happened to you this morning. &gt;&gt; You could at least say I left out of church laughing. Sorry, brother. I get carried away sometimes, especially when I see people happy. &gt;&gt; That's what it's all about. This message came to make you happy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I can't envision the children of Israel leaving out of Egypt &gt;&gt; with sorrowful faces. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I can't even believe that the children of Israel, [music] you know, when they saw the walls of Jericho fall, like, "Oh my God, what have we done?" &gt;&gt; No, they were rejoicing. &gt;&gt; The enemy is dead. &gt;&gt; That's what this message says. The enemy is dead. He's destroyed. It's over. Hallelujah. God gave us the victory and we ought to always praise him, &gt;&gt; worship him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He's worthy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's what you're going to do over there. You might as well get started. [music] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We appreciate you. I know you got a baptism, brother. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; The joy of the Lord is [music] my strength. The joy of the Lord is my strength. [music] The joy of the Lord [singing] is my strength. The joy of the Lord is my [music and singing] strength. He gives me living water and I thirst [music] no more. [singing] He gives me living water and I thirst no more. [music] He gives [singing] me living water and I thirst no more. The joy of the Lord is my strength. And he keeps [music and singing] me by his power and I have no fear. He keeps me by his power and I have no [music and singing] fear. He keeps me by his power and I have no fear. The joy of the [singing] Lord is my strength. [music] He heals the brokenhearted and they cry [music and singing] no more. He heals the brokenhearted and they cry no [singing] more. He heals the brokenhearted and they [music] cry no more. The joy of the Lord is my strength. And the word [music] of faith is mighty even in [singing] thy mouth. The word of faith is mighty even in thy [music] mouth. The word of faith is mighty even in thy [singing] mouth. The joy of the Lord is my strength. [music] Oh, the joy of the Lord. It is [singing] my strength. [music] The joy of the Lord is my strength. The joy of the Lord [music] is my strength. The joy of the Lord is my [singing] strength. Amen. [music] Praise God. Amen. I'm so glad brother Brooks just relaxed and delivered exactly what the Lord gave him to deliver. &gt;&gt; Even when he didn't think he was going to deliver. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was what we needed. &gt;&gt; How many of you testify that was exactly what you needed? &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Benham said this life isn't easy. He said it's not supposed to be easy. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and like the brother said, that's for our good. That's for our benefit. We have to be overcomers and the word must prevail. But there's a way in which the the trials of life begins to beat on us and there's a there's a a robbing of joy and there's a a crust that begins to build up. But oh, I felt like today the crust was broken off a little bit. Amen. Break off that crust. Amen. That there'll be troubles tomorrow. So what? I'm still saved. &gt;&gt; The word is still true. My name is still in the book. Amen. The victor has come forth and taken the book and purchased redemption and brought back redemption claims to earth. So what? My new trouble is not going to change that revelation. It's still true. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's be happy. Amen. That was good for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Real good for me. &gt;&gt; And I'm so thankful God knew exactly what we needed. [music] &gt;&gt; Nothing's by circumstance. God is deliberate in every move he makes and everything [music] he does. And I don't want to forget what I heard this morning just because I walk out the door and have other things in life. I want to come back to this. I want to meditate on this and say, "God, [music] let me realize how blessed I am, how happy I am, how much you've done for me, and let me shake off the crust of the world and the trappings of circumstance. And the devil's trying to just hold me back. But I'm not going to be held back &gt;&gt; because I'm free. I'm already free. There's nothing he can do to bind me because Christ has made me free. [music] &gt;&gt; Praise God. But there was some encouragement. I got some things I needed to hear. &gt;&gt; We got to stay consecrated. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We got to keep our mind consecrated. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not just laying around and and and being happy, but it's fighting to stay in the mind of God. The right mental attitude, the right thoughts, [music] Amen. from the word to keep us happy and enjoying what God has given to us. &gt;&gt; So I must stay consecrated &gt;&gt; and fight [music] to keep my mind stayed on him. &gt;&gt; And then I can rest. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And enjoy my salvation. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is good. Amen. We're going to have a baptism. So with brother Emanuel Bondo, if you would like to go around back and get prepared, we are excited to see you [music] take this step in the word, Lord. Amen. for the word of the Lord and we're exci exc excited to see what God will do for you and where he's brought you to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just before we say a word of prayer, I just want to give a happy birthday greeting to Levi Brooks. [music] I don't know where he went. He's gone. He left out, but I think he turned 16 today. So, it's a big one. Amen. So, may the Lord bless him. And Levi, wherever you're at, be careful driving on the road, buddy. Amen. Let's bow our heads together. Dear heavenly father, we're so thankful, Lord, [music] that we can say we're your children. That by a divine revelation that you've planted in our hearts, Lord, from our souls. We've been given a true identification, Lord. Spiritual amnesia is broken away. The confusion that came from sex birth is gone. But we know, Lord, where we came from because you've revealed it to us, Lord. We know who we are because you've revealed it to us. You know what we know what you're doing in this age because you revealed it to us. And we know where we're going because you have revealed it to us. God, let us set our mind on these things. Lord, forgive us for being distracted. Forgive us, Lord, for all the trappings that we've fallen into and the discouragement we've allowed to come and rest in our minds. But God, we want to take back, Lord, the the ground that we've given to the enemy. We want to consecrate our minds and our time and all of our thoughts and our hearts to you, Lord. And may we enjoy what you have given us and rejoice in it, Lord. May we be happy and rejoicing for I believe it's a pleasurable thing to you to hear your people happy and thankful and rejoicing for all you've done for us. May we, Lord, sing your praises clear. May we sing it from the the the depths of our soul from a true satisfaction and joy that can only come from the revelation of this hour. May we give back to you praises, Lord, as a sweet savor to your nostrils. We love you. We thank you for bringing our brother along and for using him as a a tool, Lord, to minister what we needed, Lord. And you know what I needed. You know what we needed, Lord. And you delivered it through our brother. May you bless him and his wife and his family as they travel back. Keep them safe on the road. Bless him, Lord, and his ministry. Bless their home church, Lord. And may you just pour out a special blessing upon him. And God, as we move forward from here, may we never forget how blessed that we are and how happy we should be, how free you have made us. And help us, Lord, not to give give one inch to the enemy.

Uh, brother Emanuel came to me last Sunday, expressed to me his desire to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. He had never taken that step yet and he saw it in the word and God had been tugging at his heart and he was responding to the word and he wanted to fully obey. So, it's a great privilege for us as a body of believers to see our brother fully obey the word because we know obedience to the word puts him in line for a promise. And that promise is he shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. So, we're excited. So, brother Emanuel, upon your confession of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ because you want to be identified with him in death, burial, and resurrection and take his name in baptism. It's with great joy that I now baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Oh heavenly father, we thank you so much for this soul, Lord, that you have gathered to yourself that you have went out as a great shepherd and you found this lamb and you've brought him close and he's heard your voice. He's heard your call and he saw your word and he's obed obedient to that word and God, he's made a public declaration of faith. He's taken your name according to the word. He's given himself holy to you. Now I pray that you'd give him the promise that you promised that you would fill him with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. May you spark this spark to life. May that spark light his candle. May it burn forever. And may it go from here a burning ember in the world, a bright light. And may you use him for your glory. May you shelter him, protect him, prosper him, and grow him from this point on into your very image. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you, my brother. &gt;&gt; [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; who began a good work [singing] in [music] you. Let's all stand.
