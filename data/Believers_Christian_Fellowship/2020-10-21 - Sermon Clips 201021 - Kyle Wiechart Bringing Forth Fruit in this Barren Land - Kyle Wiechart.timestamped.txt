[0:00] verily verily i say unto thee when i was
[0:02] young
[0:03] thou girdest thyself and walk us wither
[0:05] wither thou
[0:06] woodest but when thou shalt be old
[0:09] thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and
[0:11] the nether shall gird thee
[0:13] and carry thee wither you would not this
[0:16] spakey
[0:16] this is what i wanna this spakey
[0:20] signifying what death he should glorify
[0:23] god and it's just it struck me i don't
[0:27] think i ever spoke on it the last time i
[0:29] was here but
[0:30] what death would glorify god if me and
[0:33] you and our human reasoning and mind
[0:35] would say hey peter want to bring glory
[0:36] to god why don't you go down to the next
[0:38] city have a great big revival invite a
[0:40] lot of people
[0:42] get a lot of converts do a lot of
[0:44] miracles
[0:45] you know what that would be displeasing
[0:47] to god
[0:49] because at this point in the journey of
[0:51] peter he'll come to a certain point that
[0:53] the only way he will glorify god
[0:55] any longer is to die this is the only
[0:58] way to bring him glory
[1:00] is you die there comes a certain point
[1:03] where it says just die you want to
[1:06] glorify me
[1:08] just die don't look for another convert
[1:12] don't look for trying to do a great
[1:13] miracle don't look for trying to have a
[1:15] great ministry or preach a great sermon
[1:18] just die this will glorify me
[1:22] it gets to those points for each and
[1:24] every one of us i think i
[1:26] i honestly believe that this is the only
[1:27] way that god is wholly going to express
[1:28] himself and you and me
[1:30] is me and you we just we just die
[1:33] we don't look for anything great we
[1:34] don't look for anything grand we just
[1:35] say lord that's what you ask that's what
[1:37] i do
