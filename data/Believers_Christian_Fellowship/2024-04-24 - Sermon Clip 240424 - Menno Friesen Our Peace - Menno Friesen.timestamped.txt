[0:00] look at all the message the preachers in
[0:02] the world and there's one true voice in
[0:04] the world there's not two prophets
[0:06] there's not two voices in the world it's
[0:08] not my voice or your pastor's voice it's
[0:10] the it's God's voice that's speaking
[0:12] back that's right we're not wondering if
[0:15] this message is right even many times it
[0:17] looks like something oh it missed the
[0:18] mark missed the mark and you know the
[0:20] critics are saying everywhere now oh
[0:22] brother BR was wrong here brother was
[0:23] wrong there critic don't pay don't even
[0:26] pay one bit of attention to it amen you
[0:28] know what happened they just didn't
[0:29] listen long enough that's right y amen
[0:32] what seemed to be a question over here
[0:33] was answered over here you go back and
[0:35] try to find all the answers say oh in
[0:37] the first pull yeah oh yeah the seals
[0:40] are not open the Mysteries oh no it's
[0:41] not well you stay there and you'll die
[0:43] right there that's right that's just
[0:45] like trying to go fix up the Methodist
[0:47] and the Baptist or the Pentecostal or
[0:49] the menites or any of them try to fix
[0:50] them back up again how are you going to
[0:52] how you going to do it when the the life
[0:54] is already
[0:54] [Music]
[0:56] left the life is no longer in Luther's
[0:58] message it's the same sanctification
[1:01] Same Spirit that went all the way
[1:02] through but you try to take this
[1:05] message you know and I'm let me I'll be
[1:08] very kind gentle
[1:11] loving I I am I am but I say this you
[1:16] can never you can never change the
[1:19] direction that God's going amen just
[1:23] stay in the direction he's walking
[1:24] that's right from glory to glory to
[1:28] glory he's changing you yeah there's
[1:30] preachers around this message that are
[1:32] trying to change the course of the
[1:35] ministry we're not going back we're
[1:39] going
[1:40] forward I'm all for everything I'm I'm
[1:42] for excitement for joy and peace and joy
[1:45] but we're not going for any subject
[1:46] alone we're walking in all of the light
[1:48] of the world stay right there keep right
[1:50] on walking somebody tries to isolate a
[1:52] little part and put pull it apart watch
[1:56] it the message doesn't change amen every
[2:00] time brother BR when he went to a
[2:01] certain place and said now I've walked
[2:02] till this place he said but now I'm
[2:04] waiting here it is then he come said now
[2:06] I wondered of all those things he said
[2:08] now here it is Sir is this the time and
[2:10] he went by there and he said now watch
[2:12] come back to this tape he said later on
[2:13] said remember I told you this this and
[2:15] that that's right how many times have we
[2:17] done that as ministers there's a little
[2:19] question comes up or a little something
[2:20] then we go back and search it out and
[2:22] say but but he said this over here but
[2:23] it sounds like it's contradicting just
[2:25] keep it walking a little
[2:28] bit there wasn't all the light back
[2:31] then even there comes around in remember
[2:33] how he used to say th talk about the
[2:36] Seven Seals said it's the back part of
[2:37] the book he said it's not even written
[2:38] in the book that's what he used to say
[2:41] right but about the third seal he said I
[2:44] was wrong it's written there but our
[2:46] spiritual eyes was withheld from it as
[2:49] Daniel had been told and John was told
[2:53] that it wouldn't be it wouldn't be
[2:54] revealed to the time of the
[2:56] end so he said God withheld it from us
[2:59] and did let us know all the Mysteries
[3:01] until this age but now he pulled it back
[3:03] and let us know then he took that
[3:05] mystery and revealed the rest of the
[3:06] mystery kept on going kept right on
[3:08] climbing that's right tell what what did
[3:10] we see Behold the Lamb of God Christ The
[3:13] Mystery of God revealed
