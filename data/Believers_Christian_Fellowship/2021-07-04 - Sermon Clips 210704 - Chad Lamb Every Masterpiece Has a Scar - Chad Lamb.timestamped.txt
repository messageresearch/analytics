[0:00] see when you come into this life as a
[0:01] child you've got that
[0:03] golden bowl of oil in the human heart
[0:08] is that true yes golden bowl of oil
[0:12] in the human heart and somewhere along
[0:15] the way it's been broken
[0:18] i don't know any of us that can say it's
[0:20] not been broken
[0:22] it's been broken we know what it's like
[0:24] for the heart to be broken
[0:25] and the oil to leak out
[0:29] but what the prophet said is that can be
[0:31] healed
[0:33] that can be healed it can be healed and
[0:36] it can hold oil again
[0:38] that's the most encouraging thing to me
[0:40] is it doesn't have to stay
[0:42] that way that heart can be healed and it
[0:44] can hold oil again
[0:47] but you'll always have a scar
[0:52] will you ever completely forget whatever
[0:54] happened to you no
[0:56] we'll will you never think back
[1:00] with regrets and never think back uh at
[1:03] the difficulties will it
[1:04] will it never will the scar go away
[1:07] no the scar is not going to go away
[1:11] but to me the scar is the masterpiece
[1:15] because the scar shows that there was a
[1:17] god that could heal that heart so it
[1:19] could hold oil again
[1:21] the scar is what shows god the scar is
[1:23] what shows the power of god
[1:25] the scar is what shows the ability of
[1:27] god to take what the devil tried to
[1:29] bring ruined to
[1:30] but god can bring a healing so that
[1:32] heart can hold that golden oil again
[1:34] and you can love and receive love and
[1:36] you can function as a christian
[1:38] as a believer because there's a god on
[1:40] this earth there's a redemption that's
[1:41] taking place
[1:42] there's a power of healing that's here
[1:47] let the scar be a masterpiece amen
[1:50] quit letting the devil take your scar
[1:53] and continue to bring ruination it can
[1:55] bring
[1:55] bring heartache and bring destruction
[1:57] amen that's not why it's there
[1:59] it's there to display the power of god
[2:02] and all the attributes of god
[2:03] to overcome everything that the devil
[2:05] has ever laid at the feet of god's
[2:07] children
[2:08] there is a power that has been released
[2:10] in this hour and that is the full power
[2:12] of the full word
[2:13] so that we can fly a little higher than
[2:15] the chicken yard a little higher than
[2:17] the fence post so we can get up and say
[2:19] it's all been god god knew the end from
[2:21] the beginning there's nothing out of
[2:23] kilter with god
[2:24] i'm not damaged goods i'm a display of
[2:27] righteousness i'm a display of the power
[2:29] of god i'm a display of the handiwork of
[2:31] god
[2:34] it's the scar that makes the masterpiece
