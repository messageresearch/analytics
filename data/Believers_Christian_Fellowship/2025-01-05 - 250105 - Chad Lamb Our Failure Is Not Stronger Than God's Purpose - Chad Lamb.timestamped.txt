[15:44] we're standing if you want to take your
[15:46] Bibles we'll turn to the Book of Romans
[15:48] and while we're turning there I've got
[15:50] another picture of the newest baby to

[15:55] of the little uh Sanders baby and uh so
[15:58] we got the details we didn't have all
[16:00] the details then but she was born

[16:06] welcome little Lydia Alise Sanders man
[16:09] it was exciting I told you those who
[16:11] were here Tuesday night when we
[16:12] announced it at the watch night it was
[16:13] super exciting for me because social
[16:15] media has ruined all my surprises can't
[16:19] announce engagements I can't announce
[16:21] birth without everybody knowing it but
[16:23] this was a fun one amen that she was
[16:25] born then so we appreciate the picture
[16:27] and wanted all of you to get a chance to
[16:29] see her man I appreciated watch night I
[16:32] had a good time I appreciated everybody
[16:34] who contributed it was quite a blessing
[16:36] to be here together and I enjoyed it
[16:39] very much also wanted to let you know
[16:42] before we read the scripture that the uh
[16:44] uh Church age book Bible study will
[16:46] continue on this uh Thursday in Lord
[16:49] willing it'll be our final last session
[16:51] we'll be going through resume the ages
[16:52] the last chapter so I'm looking forward
[16:54] to that so that'll be this
[16:56] Thursday uh this Thursday in the
[16:58] fellowship
[17:00] uh also one more announcement um this
[17:03] was a bit of a surprise for me but we'll
[17:05] have a guest Minister this Wednesday
[17:07] brother Stan price from Florida will be
[17:09] ministering for us here on Wednesday
[17:11] brother Stan's a brother I just had a
[17:12] chance to meet just uh this last year
[17:15] had some fellowship with him and really
[17:17] really enjoyed it and so he's in the
[17:19] area visiting some of his family and I
[17:21] caught wind and uh so I asked him if he
[17:24] could come and Minister for us and he
[17:26] delayed his departure by a couple days
[17:28] so could come so he'll be here Wednesday
[17:30] night so we're looking forward to that
[17:32] and I'm I'm excited for you to get a
[17:34] chance to meet him and hear the word
[17:36] from him amen praise God while we're
[17:39] standing let's look at Romans chapter 8
[17:48] together Romans chapter
[17:51] 8 in verse 35
[17:59] says who shall separate us from the love
[18:00] of Christ shall
[18:02] tribulation or distress or persecution
[18:05] or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword
[18:09] as it is written for thy sake we are
[18:11] killed all the day long we are counted
[18:14] as sheep for the slaughter nay in all
[18:16] these things we are more than conquerors
[18:18] through him that loved us for I am
[18:21] persuaded that neither death nor life
[18:23] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[18:26] nor things present nor things to come
[18:28] nor height nor depth nor any other
[18:31] creature shall be able to separate us
[18:33] from the love of God which is in Christ
[18:35] Jesus our lord amen may God bless you as
[18:38] you take your seats may God bless us as
[18:40] we look into his word and may He bless
[18:42] us with the spirit of Revelation
[18:45] amen that's what we desire that God will
[18:47] open our understanding and open our eyes
[18:50] to see what he has for us this hour we
[18:53] read this scripture because it's it's
[18:54] such a good reminder that the love of
[18:57] God for us is fixed
[19:00] it was fixed before the foundation of
[19:02] the world and there's not anything
[19:04] that'll separate us from the love of God
[19:07] which is in Christ Jesus I mean he he he
[19:10] goes through quite an extensive list of
[19:12] many different things uh uh and it's
[19:15] interesting death nor life will separate
[19:18] us angels nor principalities so powers
[19:21] that are Beyond this world or powers
[19:23] that are in this world will neither one
[19:25] separate us death or life will neither
[19:27] one separate us there's nothing that can
[19:30] separate us uh from the love nor height
[19:33] nor depth nor cre so there's no distance
[19:36] there's no physical distance there's no
[19:38] spiritual power there's no earthly power
[19:40] there's nothing that can separate us
[19:42] from the love of God what a consolation
[19:46] friends and so
[19:50] uh then it starts off in verse 35 he
[19:53] said what shall separate us from the
[19:54] love of God shall tribulation or
[19:56] distress or persecution or famine or
[19:59] nakedness or Peril or sword nothing good
[20:04] things bad things things in between
[20:06] nothing will separate us from the love
[20:08] of God Amen this is good to remember
[20:11] when we get into some situations that
[20:13] aren't so pleasant that God's love is
[20:15] fixed amen amen now there's a specific
[20:19] subject I just want to uh labor on this
[20:21] morning and just want to share with you
[20:23] and and these are things that we've been
[20:25] talking about and discussing it feels
[20:26] like for quite some time so so you'll
[20:28] find that there's nothing new in what
[20:30] we'll be talking about today but for
[20:32] some reason my heart keeps getting
[20:34] pulled back to the same thing over and
[20:36] over again so I'm not trying to just
[20:38] repeat sermons and and talk about the
[20:40] same subject but I believe there's a
[20:41] purpose in it if God is directing us
[20:43] that way we still have need of an
[20:45] understanding there's something that
[20:47] needs to become reality to us to give us
[20:50] the courage to be all that he's called
[20:51] us to be in this hour and so for a
[20:54] subject if you just want to write a
[20:55] title to help us Focus it'll be our
[20:58] failure is not stronger than God's
[21:01] purpose our failure is not stronger than
[21:04] God's
[21:05] purpose and and failure is something we
[21:09] should just come to terms with we might
[21:12] as well just come to terms with it now
[21:14] that we're all going to fail right and
[21:17] we're all going to fail in the areas
[21:19] that we don't want to fail and we're all
[21:21] going to fail the people we don't want
[21:22] to fail and we will all fail God in one
[21:25] way or another and and we must come to
[21:27] terms with that if we read through the
[21:29] Bible I mean it's very apparent if we
[21:31] walk look through all what we call the
[21:33] Heroes of Faith and everybody that God
[21:35] has used in a great way in the Bible
[21:37] amen they were riddled with failure they
[21:40] all would have times of great success
[21:42] and the great achievement and great
[21:44] accomplishment but they would also have
[21:46] times of great failure and mistakes and
[21:49] and and and and backslidings and all of
[21:51] these things and you can just start
[21:53] picking characters out of the Bible and
[21:54] going down through and you find that
[21:56] this pattern is true amen and that's
[22:00] that's encouragement because we find the
[22:02] same thing in US amen amen so I I I just
[22:07] like to start off and just look at Moses
[22:09] for a minute if you could turn to Exodus
[22:10] chapter 2 I just want to read through
[22:12] Moses that lay it as a foundation and
[22:14] then move from
[22:16] there Exodus chapter
[22:19] 2 we know Moses was born a proper child
[22:22] he was born under a sign his mother and
[22:24] father hid him away and the
[22:26] circumstances of his Deliverance as as a
[22:28] baby were very Supernatural found
[22:31] himself raised in in the pharaoh's home
[22:34] and educated in the Egyptian system and
[22:36] and with every advancement but he had as
[22:38] a wet nurse his own mother and she began
[22:42] to tell him his purpose in life and and
[22:45] his that he was born under a sign and
[22:47] the the the promise to Abraham and
[22:49] deliverance and and he began to hear all
[22:51] of these things and know him and grow up
[22:52] in this and so he he he had in his mind
[22:56] a desire unto his Brethren and he had in
[22:58] his mind a desire to fulfill his purpose
[23:01] and his calling and the will of God to
[23:04] deliver them and it says in Exodus
[23:07] 2:1 says and it came to pass in those
[23:10] days when Moses was grown that he went
[23:13] out unto his Brethren and looked on
[23:14] their burdens and he spied an Egyptian
[23:17] smiting a Hebrew one of his Brethren and
[23:19] he looked this way and that way and when
[23:21] he saw that there was no man he slew the
[23:23] Egyptian and hid him in the sand and he
[23:26] went out the second day behold two of
[23:27] the men of of the Hebrews strove
[23:29] together and he said unto him that did
[23:32] the wrong wherefore Smit us thou thy
[23:34] fellow and he said who made thee a
[23:36] prince and a judge over us intend us
[23:38] thou to kill me as thou as thou killest
[23:41] the Egyptian and Moses feared and said
[23:43] surely this thing is known now when
[23:45] Pharaoh heard this thing he sought to
[23:47] slay Moses but Moses fled from the face
[23:49] of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of
[23:51] Midian and he sat down by a well so we
[23:54] know out in the land of Midian he runs
[23:57] away when it looks like uh it looks like
[24:01] Moses is going to begin to fulfill God's
[24:03] purpose of his life to be a deliverer
[24:06] and his first attempt to fulfill God's
[24:08] purpose he fails he kills an Egyptian he
[24:12] he has a a rejection from the Hebrews he
[24:15] runs away and he runs to uh he runs to
[24:18] the land of Midian amen there we know
[24:21] the story finds a wife he settles down
[24:23] he begins tending his father-in-law's
[24:24] sheep and he starts a life amen
[24:27] separated from what he was told all of
[24:30] his life was his calling and his purpose
[24:32] now he's in a completely different
[24:33] direction in a completely different land
[24:35] doing something different now he's just
[24:37] tending the flocks and the herds of
[24:39] Jethro his father-in-law amen and and
[24:41] and who knows what was in his mind or
[24:43] what he put out of his mind or what he
[24:45] thought about what his mom had told him
[24:47] amen we're human beings he was a human
[24:49] being so you can only imagine what his
[24:52] thought process was like what was that
[24:53] Mom was always telling me I I thought it
[24:55] was true but it obviously it's not true
[24:59] I tried and I failed and here I am and
[25:02] I've been here for so long for so many
[25:04] years and and this is just the way that
[25:06] it
[25:08] is oh praise God I'm so glad that God
[25:11] gave us a true account of the lies of
[25:13] his children yeah
[25:16] amen so let's turn to chapter three now
[25:20] we know in due season in due time at
[25:22] God's appointed time he comes back to
[25:24] Moses and and he begins to deal with him
[25:26] cuz Now's the Time of Deliverance
[25:28] and in Exodus 3: 10 he says come now
[25:32] therefore and I will send thee into
[25:34] Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my
[25:36] people the children of Israel out of
[25:38] Egypt and Moses said unto God who am I
[25:41] that I should go into pharaoh and that I
[25:42] should bring forth the children of
[25:44] Israel out of Egypt and he said
[25:46] certainly I will be with thee and this
[25:48] shall be a token unto thee that I have
[25:50] sent thee that when thou H has brought
[25:52] forth the people out of Egypt Thou shalt
[25:55] serve God Upon This Mountain so Moses
[25:59] god comes now to Moses and we know that
[26:01] he comes as a fire in a bush the pillar
[26:03] of fire in the burning bush and Moses
[26:05] Drew aside to see this phenomenon and as
[26:08] he got close the voice spoke out of the
[26:10] fire and told him to put off his shoes
[26:12] and he has this Supernatural encounter
[26:14] with God and the supernatural encounter
[26:16] with God puts him right back into the
[26:19] same understanding that he had from his
[26:21] mother when she was his
[26:24] nurse he thought it was gone he thought
[26:27] it was finished he thought he tried and
[26:28] failed and there was some
[26:29] misunderstanding somewhere and some
[26:31] mistake and the and the pillar of fire
[26:34] encounter brings him right back to his
[26:36] purpose and you know what he says I
[26:39] can't do
[26:40] it it's not me who am I who who God who
[26:45] am I to go to pharaoh who am I to do
[26:47] these things and we know that that God
[26:49] now is is is going to fulfill his
[26:52] purpose and Moses is in that purpose and
[26:54] God needs Moses to fulfill the purpose
[26:57] that he has for Moses but Moses has
[26:59] failed Moses has run away he's changed
[27:02] his mind yeah but just because Moses
[27:05] changed his mind doesn't mean God
[27:07] changed his
[27:08] mind amen I'm so oh I'm so thankful and
[27:13] then they begin this this banter back
[27:15] and forth amen and and uh let's go to
[27:18] chapter 4 verse
[27:23] one and Moses answered and said but
[27:26] behold thou will not uh they will not
[27:29] believe me nor heren unto my voice for
[27:31] they will say the Lord hath not appeared
[27:33] unto thee and so he says go well they
[27:37] they won't even listen to me who am I to
[27:38] go okay you want me but they weren't
[27:40] going to listen to me then he tells them
[27:42] that he gives them signs and all of
[27:43] these things and then we go to verse 10
[27:46] and Moses said unto the Lord oh my Lord
[27:48] I am not eloquent neither heret for nor
[27:51] since thou has spoken unto thy servant
[27:53] but I'm slow of speech and of a slow
[27:55] tongue and the Lord said unto him who
[27:58] hath made Man's
[28:00] Tongue or who maketh the dumb or deaf or
[28:03] the seeing or the blind have not ey the
[28:05] Lord now therefore go and I will be with
[28:07] thy mouth and teach thee what Thou shalt
[28:10] say here Moses has all kinds of
[28:13] reasonings in his mind why this won't
[28:16] work but none of the reasonings will
[28:18] determine God's purpose in his life he's
[28:21] got a lot of of to him sound reasoning I
[28:24] already tried that it didn't work who am
[28:25] I to go to Pharaoh the children of
[28:27] Israel won't listen listen to me I'm
[28:28] slow of speech I I can't talk right and
[28:31] God says I I mean basically who do you
[28:34] think you're talking to
[28:37] Moses right like I'm telling you to go
[28:40] and you're telling me you can't and
[28:42] you're giving me the list of reasons why
[28:43] you can't but I'm the god the creator of
[28:46] Heaven and Earth I created the tongue I
[28:48] created speech amen I gave you the
[28:50] ability to speak what are you doing
[28:52] telling me that what you have is not
[28:55] good enough and won't work
[28:59] God help us I hope we quit looking at
[29:02] Moses and start looking in the mirror
[29:04] and say we can come up with all kinds of
[29:06] reasons why God can't use me I can come
[29:08] up with a myriad of reasons where I have
[29:10] failed in the past and I've made
[29:12] mistakes and I've done all kinds of
[29:14] things wrong and I can come up with a
[29:15] pretty good list of why I shouldn't be
[29:17] the one to go and I can't be the one to
[29:19] talk and and I've messed this thing up
[29:21] before but that never changed God's
[29:24] purpose amen God had a purpose and God
[29:26] was going to see it through to the end
[29:28] regardless of what Moses thought about
[29:32] it or all of his
[29:35] excuses now there's a quote here in the
[29:37] message Jehovah Gyra from 1957 that I'd
[29:40] like to read to you he said a man is a
[29:44] failure he's totally lost at his birth
[29:47] there's no good in man if there's
[29:49] anything good about man it's the part of
[29:51] God that's in
[29:52] him for a man in himself is totally no
[29:56] good and there's any good us about him
[29:58] at all it's God that's did it for him so
[30:02] we cannot say that we did this to
[30:04] deserve this we prayed all night to get
[30:07] this it isn't whether you do this or
[30:09] that it's God it's not him that willth
[30:12] or him that runneth it's God that
[30:14] showeth Mercy it lays in the hands of
[30:19] God
[30:21] so what are we as human beings from the
[30:24] beginning
[30:26] failures so why does being a failure
[30:28] hinder you from serving God's
[30:31] purpose because you're a failure to
[30:33] begin with and what is more failure
[30:36] going to hinder us from serving God's
[30:39] purpose
[30:41] amen and
[30:44] so as we look at this I I want to read
[30:47] this next quote and then we'll we'll
[30:49] keep moving with this thought but he
[30:51] says and perfect strength by Perfect
[30:53] weakness now we are very grateful that
[30:55] we still have a kind heavenly father who
[30:57] looks over our mist stakes and doesn't
[30:58] reckon them to us as I was reading over
[31:01] the book of Romans the 4th chapter where
[31:02] Paul wrote The Divine commentary the
[31:04] life of Abraham now we know that Abraham
[31:06] many times got kind of flustered
[31:08] flustrated like we do his commentary was
[31:11] wrote there wasn't any of his fluster
[31:14] mentioned never mention them at all said
[31:16] Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[31:18] God through unbelief but was strong
[31:19] giving praise to God see and that's the
[31:22] way I hope mine will be wrote down in
[31:24] there it's not my mistakes and
[31:25] everything but just what I try to do the
[31:28] intention of my heart to do for God's
[31:30] people amen when when Paul start when
[31:33] Paul makes that statement and when we
[31:34] look over at Hebrews amen the record of
[31:36] Abraham it's Abraham was he was the
[31:40] father of Faith Abraham staggered not at
[31:42] the promise of God Abraham believed amen
[31:44] and it doesn't go through all the
[31:46] details of Abraham not believing and
[31:49] Abraham making mistakes and Abraham
[31:51] lening to his wife and Abraham going to
[31:52] Gar and Abraham going to Egypt and all
[31:54] the things that Abraham did amen the
[31:57] grace covered for that
[31:59] amen and I if I could uh maybe just
[32:03] separate something out now
[32:05] amen I I don't know exactly I don't know
[32:08] how to say things sometimes and make
[32:10] them actually accurate so I'm not going
[32:11] to try to make an accurate statement I'm
[32:13] just going to make a
[32:14] statement when Abraham went to Gar when
[32:16] he backslid when he doubted when he when
[32:18] he uh took Hagar to fulfill the promise
[32:20] when he did all of those things that he
[32:23] did let's just say that this Abraham did
[32:27] that
[32:28] amen but when Abraham staggered not at
[32:31] the promises of God let's just say it
[32:33] was this Abraham that did that
[32:36] right maybe that will help us separate
[32:38] some things because what was in the
[32:41] Divine record was what God had intended
[32:44] Abraham to be all along the internal
[32:45] thought of God concerning
[32:48] Abraham
[32:49] amen this outside is in a certain
[32:52] condition because of the Fall because of
[32:54] hybridization because of the Fallen
[32:56] condition of the world and it's going
[32:58] it's got a sticky cckar nature it's
[32:59] always going to cause problems it's
[33:01] going to fail it's going to fall but
[33:03] there's a seed of predestination on the
[33:05] inside and brother benam said that seed
[33:07] was meant to be you from the beginning
[33:09] and you didn't come the right way we
[33:11] came this way amen there's a purpose in
[33:13] coming this way absolutely but if we had
[33:16] come the intended way then it would have
[33:18] just sprung life we' had a body that
[33:20] could accurately Express amen that seed
[33:22] that was on the inside but now we came
[33:24] with a body that was born in
[33:25] hybridization and Corruption and we have
[33:27] trouble now expressing that
[33:30] seed
[33:32] amen so we find this all through the
[33:35] Bible there's a whole pile of mistakes
[33:38] that everybody has made I want to look
[33:41] at Luke chap
[33:42] 22
[33:51] together Luke chapter 22
[34:03] in verse 31 Luke 22 and
[34:10] 31 he
[34:12] says Luke 22:31 and the Lord said Simon
[34:16] Simon behold satanath desired to have
[34:18] you that he may sift you as wheat but I
[34:21] have prayed for thee that thy faith fail
[34:23] not and when thou art converted
[34:25] strengthen thy brethren
[34:28] and he said unto the Lord I am ready to
[34:30] go with thee both into prison and to
[34:32] death and he said I tell thee Peter the
[34:35] shall not Crow this day before that
[34:37] thou shalt Thrice deny that thou knowest
[34:40] me let's go down to verse
[34:45] 60 this is after Peter denies the Lord
[34:48] and it says in verse 60 and Peter said
[34:50] man I know not what thou sayest and
[34:53] immediately while he yet spake the
[34:55] crew and the Lord turned and looked upon
[34:57] on Peter and Peter remembered the word
[34:59] of the Lord how he had said unto him
[35:01] before the Crow Thou shalt deny me
[35:03] Thrice and Peter went out and wept
[35:07] bitterly this is a remarkable story for
[35:10] many reasons and many things are going
[35:13] on here but one thing that I find to be
[35:15] amazing is God knew that Peter was going
[35:19] to fail Before Peter
[35:22] failed he prophesied that Peter would
[35:25] fail
[35:28] he he knew that the devil had desired to
[35:31] sift him his wheat and he did not deny
[35:34] Satan the
[35:35] opportunity but he prayed that his faith
[35:38] fail not but he prophesied ahead of time
[35:41] that the shall not grow till thou
[35:43] has denied me and and it happened
[35:46] exactly and and then you know Peter
[35:48] denied it you know there's no way I
[35:51] there's no way because I'm I'm ready to
[35:53] give my life I'm ready to give go to
[35:54] prison and even death with you and
[35:56] that's what Peter really believed but
[35:58] that was Peter in his own strength that
[36:00] was Peter and Peter's human strength
[36:02] with Peter's human thinking thinking
[36:04] that he had what it t takes to endure
[36:06] that he was going to go all the way and
[36:09] really you know Peter needed to realize
[36:11] how weak he really
[36:13] was but God knew ahead of time that
[36:15] Peter was going to fail amen even though
[36:18] Peter didn't believe it it happened
[36:20] exactly the way it was and and the
[36:22] question is if God knew why didn't God
[36:25] change the circumstances if God knew why
[36:27] didn't God stop it if God knew Peter was
[36:29] going to fail ahead of time and he
[36:31] prayed that his faith failed not amen
[36:32] and even could prophesy and then Peter
[36:34] fail amen then then God must have a
[36:38] purpose in the failure because nothing
[36:39] that we do will stop God's
[36:42] purpose and God purposed that he would
[36:44] give Peter the keys to the kingdom is
[36:47] that right he said I give to you the
[36:48] Keys of the Kingdom amen and and and and
[36:51] and he promised Peter along with the
[36:53] disciples that I have ordained you that
[36:55] you should go forth into the world that
[36:56] you'll take this gospel amen as many as
[36:59] believe and are baptized shall be saved
[37:00] amen you're going to go and you're going
[37:02] to bring forth fruit and your fruit
[37:03] shall remain all of that was the purpose
[37:06] of God for Peter's life amen but Peter
[37:08] was going to come now and deny the Lord
[37:11] weep curse and swear as he does it amen
[37:14] deny the Lord go out and weep wh weep uh
[37:17] bitterly but is not going to change
[37:20] God's purpose he's still going to give
[37:21] the Keys of the Kingdom to Peter and
[37:23] he's still going to go forth and bring
[37:24] fruit and he's still ordained to carry
[37:26] the gospel
[37:30] and and so
[37:32] shockingly God knows Peter's going to
[37:35] fail but God won't allow anything
[37:38] that'll stop God's purpose so this
[37:40] failure must work together for God's
[37:45] purpose
[37:47] Amen brother bam said in the message
[37:49] standing in the Gap but we see even the
[37:52] great St Paul got between Straits one
[37:54] time and many times that God has did
[37:56] things or let his vs do it that was
[37:59] mistakes in in order to prove these
[38:01] things now we know that human beings can
[38:04] make mistakes but God can make no
[38:07] mistake so God's not making a mistake
[38:10] with our
[38:11] life there is no
[38:14] mistake like we make a mistake
[38:16] absolutely it's a mistake but that
[38:18] mistake can't can't be in such a way
[38:21] that it mistakes the purpose and plan of
[38:23] God in our life there's a trump card in
[38:26] our lives there's something that
[38:27] overrides everything else and that is
[38:29] the purpose of God that is God's
[38:32] predestinated Divine Purpose for our
[38:34] lives and it absolutely supersedes
[38:36] everything else and we're going to look
[38:38] at that and we're going to see that amen
[38:41] uh uh let's just look at it now brother
[38:45] Franco I hit that D dcam button is that
[38:48] going to bring it up bring up the white
[38:50] board or
[38:51] whatever I try to be Technical and I
[38:53] just don't get it friends I'm sorry I
[38:56] want to be smart heart and understand
[38:58] these things but I need lots of help so
[39:00] brother Fran if you can bring that up
[39:01] for me I probably just fried the whole
[39:03] system by pushing the button but anyways
[39:07] I want to look at some things in in
[39:09] brother brenham's life I keep going back
[39:11] to brother brenham's life because I
[39:12] believe there's a reason it was given to
[39:14] us in this generation on 1200 tapes and
[39:17] testimonies and records and and and all
[39:19] the things that we have recordings and
[39:22] and video and all of the things that God
[39:24] has given us I believe he's given it to
[39:25] us for a reason amen because if we don't
[39:28] understand how God deals with the Son of
[39:30] God who's got a gift and a purpose in
[39:31] his life we're going to be we can easily
[39:33] become confused about how God's working
[39:35] in our lives amen and and I just want to
[39:39] write a little list for you
[39:42] um I'm just going to make this first
[39:45] list
[40:01] if it wasn't for God's
[40:05] intervention this is the first
[40:08] list if it wasn't for God's
[40:13] intervention brother brandham would
[40:16] have
[40:19] killed the boys who beat him up
[40:29] he
[40:30] had been
[40:32] beaten but he had a life of
[40:34] rejection on top of the beating and
[40:38] after the beating he went and grabbed
[40:39] his 22 rifle and he ran out and cut the
[40:42] boys off on the path that they were in
[40:44] and he jumped out in front of them and
[40:46] said who wants to die
[40:49] first he had full intention of shooting
[40:53] those
[40:55] boys and he started trying to pull the
[40:57] trigger and try and and trying to load
[40:59] another another one in the chamber and
[41:01] none of those bullets would go
[41:07] off I'm I'm going to say this and we're
[41:10] going to go through a whole list because
[41:11] I want you to think I like I've been
[41:16] thinking I thought we had a law of free
[41:18] moral
[41:21] agency is that right is there a law free
[41:24] moral agency we can choose to do what we
[41:26] want to choose to do and God will not
[41:28] violate free moral
[41:30] agency brother brenham's Choice was to
[41:34] kill these
[41:38] boys did God supersede his free moral
[41:43] agency did he override the law of free
[41:46] moral
[41:50] agency sometimes it just amazes
[41:53] me that one thing that I'm
[41:57] realizing is there's no way to simplify
[42:01] God and say God did this for this reason
[42:05] this equals that because the the moment
[42:07] we try to simplify God we make it so
[42:10] complicated we'll never understand it
[42:12] because we try to wedge him into a hole
[42:14] and if he fits in this hole then he
[42:15] can't also fit in this hole at the same
[42:16] time or this hole but God can fit in
[42:18] every one of our holes simultaneously
[42:21] allow free moral agency but not stop his
[42:23] perfect plan in our lives override for
[42:26] free moral agency but never be unjust
[42:27] and allowing for I don't know how he
[42:29] does it all but he's
[42:32] God and we've so so the human brain so
[42:36] tries to understand things and
[42:38] compartmentalize things because we have
[42:40] trouble anything that we cannot explain
[42:43] starts to trouble
[42:44] us like we've went through this years
[42:46] ago when we start talking about you you
[42:49] you you you have a dark night and in a
[42:52] dark night you hear a strange sound and
[42:55] you can't see the unknown begins to
[42:57] paralyze us with fear because to cause
[42:59] all kinds of
[43:00] trouble right if it was Daylight and you
[43:04] saw amen the breeze come in the window
[43:07] knock the whatever off the counter and
[43:09] fall on the floor zero fear whatsoever
[43:11] but you do it under the cloak of night
[43:13] when you have no idea what that noise
[43:15] just was and all of a sudden we're we
[43:17] we're trying to compartmentalize and
[43:19] then our mind goes to try to rationalize
[43:20] we're trying to rationalize what we just
[43:22] heard because as soon as we can identify
[43:24] it we can relax right and we try to do
[43:27] the same thing with the things of God we
[43:29] try to and we come up with all kinds of
[43:31] explanations this circumstance in my
[43:33] life happened because of this and God
[43:34] was accomplishing that in the reality he
[43:36] was probably doing so many things that
[43:38] your brain will never be able to
[43:40] calculate all that God was doing with
[43:42] this circumstance in our
[43:45] life and so we can't come up with
[43:47] simplistic understanding simplistic
[43:50] answers that is just a one-off this
[43:52] happened because of that God did this
[43:53] because of this God does everything he
[43:56] does
[43:57] for his Divine
[43:59] Purpose and how everything fits into his
[44:02] Divine Purpose I cannot always explain I
[44:05] have no idea but it doesn't matter cuz
[44:08] he
[44:09] does so if it wasn't for God's
[44:13] intervention he would have killed those
[44:18] boys he would have
[44:21] drank he would have smoked
[44:27] why is this a big deal because when he
[44:30] was a little boy the angel of the Lord
[44:31] told him don't you ever drink or smoke
[44:33] or defile your body in any way for
[44:35] there's a work for you to do when you
[44:37] get older so the angel of the Lord had
[44:39] forbidden him to smoke or to drink or
[44:42] defile his body and he says that's run
[44:44] around with women and so now he gets in
[44:47] a situation you know the story as well
[44:49] as I do but he gets into a situation
[44:51] where he's got a man who's a friend of
[44:53] his fathers and he's trying to impress
[44:55] this man because he wants to be able to
[44:56] use his boat and they're out in a boat
[44:59] and they're they're they're uh he's with
[45:01] his dad he's with his dad's buddy and
[45:03] he's there and I think his brother's

[46:10] wind the the little Whirlwind in the
[46:12] tree and it come in his ears and he put
[46:14] the bottle down and he tried a second
[46:16] time and it got louder and louder and he
[46:19] handed the bottle back and he jumped out
[46:20] and he ran away crying amen he didn't
[46:23] know what was happening what was it it
[46:25] was God over writing his free moral
[46:28] agency because God had a purpose in his
[46:30] life that was the whole point don't
[46:33] drink or smoke or defile yourself in any
[46:35] way for there's a purpose I've got a
[46:36] work for you to do when you get older

[47:19] thought you were a man or something like
[47:21] that he says give me that
[47:25] cigarette I don't know about you but I
[47:27] am so thankful that God's purpose will
[47:30] not be
[47:34] defeated peer pressure desires oh you
[47:38] just name what it is God's purpose will
[47:40] not be
[47:44] defeated if it wasn't for the
[47:46] intervention of
[47:49] God he would have died on Hurricane
[47:52] Mountain
[47:58] along with
[48:00] Ma and
[48:05] Billy got up there and left him in a
[48:07] lean to went out storms coming got lost
[48:10] we know the story really
[48:11] well mean he learned a valuable
[48:15] lesson but if it wasn't for the
[48:17] intervention of God he would have
[48:20] died if it wasn't for the intervention
[48:24] of God
[48:27] he would have committed
[48:35] suicide
[48:38] twice you know the first time as this
[48:41] both were after his loss of his wife and
[48:43] the loss of his baby and he couldn't
[48:46] take the grief anymore the first he
[48:47] tried to electrocute himself by grabbing
[48:49] a be wire as a lineman so he doesn't
[48:52] know what happened all he remembers is
[48:53] reaching out for the while and he woke
[48:55] up and he was sitting on the ground
[48:56] crying
[48:57] he doesn't know what
[48:59] happened I know what happened God had a
[49:02] purpose in his
[49:08] life the second time he had a
[49:12] revolver and he got so down and so
[49:15] desperate and so
[49:17] brokenhearted he wanted to take his own
[49:19] life and he put that gun to his head and
[49:21] he as hard as he squeezed the trigger he
[49:23] couldn't get it to go off squeezed with
[49:26] all of his might
[49:28] I want to ask you where's free moral
[49:32] agency here's a man squeezing the
[49:35] trigger as hard as he
[49:37] can and finally in grief he throws the
[49:40] gun down and it shoots a hole in the
[49:42] wall you know what he says God why won't
[49:45] you let me
[49:46] die he knew who was preserving him from
[49:50] Death he knew who was holding him back
[49:52] from doing what he wanted to
[49:54] do but God had a purpose
[49:58] purpose if it wasn't for the
[50:01] intervention of
[50:04] God he would have let his lawyer believe
[50:08] a
[50:12] lie right he lied he had his wife tell
[50:16] the I'm stepped out of the room of the
[50:18] house and he tell and he was going to
[50:20] let it go but when he went down to pray
[50:22] for the baby God come on the scene and
[50:23] says how can you pray for that baby when
[50:26] you're alive
[50:27] and he had to go make it right he was
[50:29] going to just sweep it under the rug and
[50:30] move on who stopped him God
[50:34] didn't if it wasn't for
[50:40] God he would have left the
[50:44] field and
[50:49] went to British
[50:53] Colombia and in doing so he would have
[50:55] tricked his wife into going
[50:57] yeah and in doing so he would have had
[50:59] disruption in his family we know the
[51:01] whole story but that's what he was
[51:03] mulling over that's what he had been he
[51:04] said I just made up in my mind that
[51:07] that's what I was going to
[51:10] do and if it wasn't for if it wasn't for
[51:15] God interjecting himself in the
[51:17] situation that's what the prophet had
[51:19] made up his mind to do trick his wife
[51:21] into the going going up for a vacation
[51:22] and saying well it's so nice up here why
[51:23] don't we just stay and stay and help Bud
[51:26] out and and be a guide and then if God
[51:28] gives him a message he storm out like a
[51:29] prophet and say and what's the whole
[51:31] purpose behind that he was trying to get
[51:33] away from the pain of rejection because
[51:34] they didn't receive his
[51:37] ministry and he had determined and then
[51:39] God starts dealing with him in the on
[51:41] the road and dealing with him in the
[51:43] diner and or first dealing with him with
[51:45] dreams before about him being a bum with
[51:47] his brother-in-law dealing with him in
[51:48] the diner dealing with him on the road
[51:50] and finally he stops him on the side of
[51:52] the road and when he stops him on the
[51:53] side of the road he said look at that
[51:55] mountain and there's a mountain range
[51:56] there with Seven Peaks and he says your
[51:58] name is written in that that's your life
[52:00] and in there has his three pools and his
[52:02] whole life is spelled out in this
[52:03] mountain range and God injects himself
[52:06] at the right time in the right place why
[52:09] because of his
[52:12] purpose am brother baham comes back and
[52:15] repents and we know all of these things
[52:18] but if it wasn't for God's
[52:20] intervention all of these things would
[52:22] have happened
[52:27] okay I want to make another
[52:38] list
[52:41] mistakes that God
[52:48] allowed you know there's a lot of things
[52:50] he prevented the prophet from
[52:52] doing but there's a whole list of things
[52:54] he didn't stop him from
[53:00] he didn't stop him from listening to his
[53:14] mother-in-law he didn't go to the
[53:19] field I'm going to ask you what were the
[53:22] consequences of
[53:25] that were they
[53:28] harsh they were hurtful terrible hard
[53:33] consequences but God didn't stop him
[53:35] from making that choice he stopped him
[53:38] from committing suicide he stopped him
[53:40] from drinking he stopped him from
[53:41] smoking he stopped him from murdering
[53:44] but he didn't stop him when he listened
[53:47] to his mother-in-law and refused to go
[53:48] at the first
[53:50] call later you know what brother Bram
[53:52] says about this he says I didn't go when
[53:54] he first called me and he said I think
[53:56] of the of the multitudes that could have
[53:59] been healed and
[54:02] saved how and and that bothered brother
[54:05] he thought of if the Healing Ministry
[54:07] had started sooner how many more people
[54:09] would have been healed how many more
[54:11] people would have been delivered if he
[54:12] would have just went
[54:14] earlier so there was consequences for
[54:17] this action there was pain there was
[54:20] suffering that he lost his wife he lost
[54:23] his baby he he he he goes through all of
[54:25] this moral people missed out on healing
[54:29] missed out on the The Gospel message
[54:32] being
[54:33] preached because God allowed free moral
[54:38] agency now I'm going to ask you you tell
[54:42] me I need you to come up with a computer
[54:45] that can run an algorithm that can tell
[54:47] me when God will allow for moral agency
[54:49] and when he'll stop it
[54:53] amen amen
[55:01] he allowed
[55:06] him to make a
[55:10] mess of the
[55:13] first and second
[55:16] pool which created carnal impersonations
[55:28] is that right
[55:30] sir think about the cost of carnal
[55:34] impersonations and what did it cost the
[55:36] Christian world what confusion went
[55:39] out I want to read out of the seventh
[55:42] seal where brother bam talks about this
[55:45] he says and in the seventh seal he's
[55:47] going back to the vision that he had at
[55:48] the end of 1955 that begins explaining
[55:51] in 56 and we sometimes call it the tent
[55:54] Vision but the tent vision is starts off
[55:55] aici fing vision and he's explaining his
[55:58] three
[56:00] pools and he says I don't know I I've
[56:03] understood fishing now the first thing
[56:04] you do here's the way it's done you see
[56:06] all the fish around you got to jerk The
[56:08] Lure well that's exactly the tactic of
[56:10] fishing so I said jerk The Lure now you
[56:12] see when I jerk The Lure the first time
[56:14] now the fish takes out after it but they
[56:16] were little ones that's just like they
[56:18] were catching then you'll see and I
[56:20] jerked it out on the bank and I had a
[56:21] fish but it looked like skin Over The
[56:23] Lure it was so little and then I was
[56:25] standing standing there and something
[56:27] said I told you not to do that and I
[56:29] started
[56:31] crying that voice who was taking him
[56:34] through uh uh the first second and third
[56:36] pool that that was that bringing him
[56:38] through the vision that V voice says I
[56:40] told you not to do that brother bam was
[56:42] warned not to do it and he did it
[56:44] anyways and in doing it now he's
[56:46] standing in the vision he's got this
[56:48] line Tangled on he's in a mess and and
[56:50] he starts crying and and brother B says
[56:54] all the line was Tangled around me like
[56:56] this I was standing there crying with my
[56:58] head down like that I said God oh
[57:01] forgive me I'm a stupid person Lord
[57:03] forgive me and I had this line like line
[57:07] in that what I had in my hand was a
[57:08] little baby shoe about that long and the
[57:11] string was about as big around as my
[57:12] finger about half an inch like and and
[57:15] the eyelid in the shoe was just about
[57:16] the size of little than 1/16 probably of
[57:19] an inch of an eyet and I was trying to
[57:21] lace this little shoe up with this great
[57:23] big inch cord and a voice came you can't
[57:26] teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural
[57:28] things said let them alone and just then
[57:31] he picked me up and he took me up and
[57:33] set me way up high to where a meeting
[57:35] was going on looked like a tent or a
[57:37] Cathedral of some sort and I looked and
[57:38] there was a little box like little place
[57:40] over the side and I seen that light was
[57:42] talking to somebody above me that light
[57:44] that you see there on the picture it
[57:46] Whirled away from me like that and went
[57:48] over into the tent and he said I'll meet
[57:50] you there and said this will be the
[57:51] third pool and you won't tell it to
[57:53] nobody and in saino Canyon said this is
[57:56] the third pool Sabino Canyon was where
[57:58] he received the sword in the hand the
[58:01] reason I wanted to go through this
[58:02] because there was something striking to
[58:03] me in this brother brandom messed up in
[58:06] the first pool is that
[58:09] true we agreed he messed up in the
[58:12] second pool he tried to explain too much
[58:15] he was trying to explain Supernatural
[58:17] things to Pentecostal babies and he was
[58:19] like trying to get this big cord through
[58:20] this little island and and God said
[58:22] leave him alone stop trying but what he
[58:24] did is created carnal impersonations and
[58:26] things went all over and confusion about
[58:29] Divine Healing and about miracles and
[58:30] about signs of and the the confusion was
[58:33] rampant across christiandom because of
[58:36] his
[58:38] failure but what what I love about this
[58:42] this this quote this story in seven in
[58:44] the seventh seal about the vision is
[58:48] while brother brandham had his head
[58:49] hanging down saying he was a stupid
[58:52] person forgive me God the next thing
[58:55] that happen happened is God picked him
[58:57] up and showed him the third
[58:59] pool and said I'll meet you in there
[59:01] this will be your third pull what is he
[59:03] saying I'm going to use you anyways this
[59:07] hasn't stopped my purpose in your life
[59:09] you made a mistake you made a blunder
[59:11] you did wrong you should not have done
[59:12] that didn't I tell you not to do that
[59:15] and brother benam is feeling the pain oh
[59:17] God forgive me I'm a stupid person amen
[59:20] and feeling it all but it doesn't change
[59:22] God's purpose he's still going to bring
[59:24] the third pool through the same person
[59:26] who messed up the first and second pool
[59:29] because that was God's Divine Purpose in
[59:31] his life amen why did God let him do it
[59:34] I don't know all the reasons why God let
[59:36] him do it the fact is he could have
[59:37] stopped him if he wanted to stop him he
[59:40] proved it through this prophet's life if
[59:42] he wanted to stop him from doing
[59:43] something he had a way of stopping him
[59:45] but if he didn't stop
[59:48] him then maybe it also served his Divine
[59:53] Purpose because God's not going to allow
[59:55] anything thing that'll stop his Divine
[1:00:01] Purpose praise
[1:00:09] God he was
[1:00:11] allowed to have Miracle
[1:00:17] lines
[1:00:21] after he was told not to
[1:00:32] brother B tells us about
[1:00:36] this in the message experiences from
[1:00:43] 1947 and he goes on it's quite lengthy
[1:00:46] so I'm not going to read all of it but
[1:00:47] he goes to explain how he was warned by
[1:00:50] the angel of the Lord not to have the
[1:00:52] miracle lines and what they were doing
[1:00:54] is the campaign managers and brother
[1:00:56] benam they they were so enthused by this
[1:00:58] gift that was operating and the accuracy
[1:01:00] of it and this is back when it was a
[1:01:01] sign in the hand and he and he said that
[1:01:05] they would say bring your worst cases
[1:01:07] we're going to have a miracle line
[1:01:08] tonight bring the worst and they would
[1:01:10] push the worst and they wanted visible
[1:01:12] things they didn't want the hidden back
[1:01:14] they wanted they wanted the halt the
[1:01:16] lame the blind the they wanted those
[1:01:18] moved to the front and and God was
[1:01:20] honoring the gift in the prophet's life
[1:01:22] and the the prophet would be praying and
[1:01:24] they would seeing Miracles every every
[1:01:27] night but God told him not to do it so
[1:01:29] brother bham you know he tried not to do
[1:01:31] it but his campaign managers they were
[1:01:33] still wanting to do it and they were
[1:01:34] putting pressure on him they told him
[1:01:35] how effective it was and brother
[1:01:37] brandham said he allowed me to go on for
[1:01:39] six
[1:01:40] months he continued on after he was told
[1:01:43] not to he continued on doing the miracle
[1:01:46] lines the very thing God told him not to
[1:01:48] do and the reason that the angel told
[1:01:50] him not to do it is he says because they
[1:01:52] won't have faith unless they see a
[1:01:54] miracle you're actually destroying Faith
[1:01:57] that's what he told him that was the
[1:01:59] lesson and so brother B but it was so
[1:02:02] effective apparently effective that the
[1:02:04] campaign managers wanted it the host
[1:02:06] pastors wanted it and brother Benham
[1:02:08] kept giving in because he also was going
[1:02:10] down the path of reasoning saying it's
[1:02:12] working and for six months he continued
[1:02:16] on until he came to a service in Phoenix
[1:02:20] listen to what
[1:02:21] happened said you know what happened the
[1:02:24] very first person was brought a little
[1:02:26] girl I hope she's here today from
[1:02:28] California I believe it was and she was
[1:02:30] hard of hearing and I talked to the
[1:02:32] child beforehand and I put my hands upon
[1:02:34] her and the vibrations was hitting my
[1:02:36] hand from probably some kind of bursted
[1:02:38] eardrum that had caused an infection
[1:02:40] that little something to grow over it
[1:02:42] little growth caused it to have a life
[1:02:44] somewhere and the vibration stopped and
[1:02:46] I said and I said to you as always now
[1:02:49] the child is healed and I tried to talk
[1:02:52] to her and I couldn't even yell at her
[1:02:54] or beat my hands to together and she
[1:02:56] couldn't hear I turned her took a hold
[1:02:59] of her hand the vibrations back I cast
[1:03:01] it forth again and it came back so I
[1:03:03] left the child
[1:03:05] alone what happened is a child came who
[1:03:09] was hard of
[1:03:11] hearing and she left that line
[1:03:13] completely
[1:03:17] deaf says the next come was another man
[1:03:20] heart of hearing I said you believe sir
[1:03:22] he nodded his head I called out to him
[1:03:25] he nodded his head said and bowed his
[1:03:26] head and when I did I took hold of his
[1:03:27] hand no vibration that was purely
[1:03:29] spiritual by anointing of the spirit
[1:03:31] it's dead nerves probably and when I
[1:03:33] prayed for that man he couldn't even
[1:03:35] hear me beat my hand together behind him
[1:03:39] and I seen that I was
[1:03:41] condemned and there I stood in this
[1:03:43] Pulpit for the first time and I knew
[1:03:44] what it meant for a man to be left alone
[1:03:46] with God I was helpless I'm ashamed of
[1:03:50] myself before you friend today I'm
[1:03:52] ashamed of
[1:03:54] it he goes on a little further he says
[1:03:57] sometime I just now I was afraid it was
[1:04:00] gone afraid his gift was gone I couldn't
[1:04:04] feel God at all
[1:04:06] nowhere I hope and trust that'll that
[1:04:09] I'll never in all the days of my life
[1:04:11] have to go through another three days
[1:04:12] like that that was hell on Earth friends
[1:04:16] I was now God was gone the angel was
[1:04:19] gone the Holy Spirit I had nothing
[1:04:26] this
[1:04:27] is this is so interesting so um
[1:04:33] sobering that God would warn his Prophet
[1:04:35] not to do something but the prophet
[1:04:37] would continue doing it and for six
[1:04:39] months listen that's why if God if God
[1:04:44] ever warns you and tells you amen
[1:04:46] through the preaching through the
[1:04:47] prophet through the word of God whatever
[1:04:49] tells you amen and corrects you amen and
[1:04:52] you don't take the correction and
[1:04:53] continue on just because you continue on
[1:04:55] as before doesn't mean that it's
[1:04:58] okay this such a good lesson for us
[1:05:01] friends cuz many times something will
[1:05:03] come over the pull pit or we hear
[1:05:04] Brother B say something on the tape and
[1:05:05] it smites our heart and we know we're
[1:05:07] corrected and we'll just continue on and
[1:05:09] because lightning doesn't strike
[1:05:11] immediately or Nothing changed we
[1:05:13] continue on moving on and then we just
[1:05:15] think it's
[1:05:17] okay well it wasn't okay with God but
[1:05:20] God is forbearing God is longsuffering
[1:05:22] God is always giving us a chance to come
[1:05:24] to our own repentance am yesen and here
[1:05:28] brother R now not only does the gift not
[1:05:31] work the people who came to him to be
[1:05:33] delivered are worse than they were when
[1:05:35] they came they were both hard of hearing
[1:05:38] now they're deaf then he leaves and he
[1:05:40] gets on a plane and he flies away and
[1:05:42] it's gone he doesn't feel God he doesn't
[1:05:44] feel the spirit he doesn't feel anything
[1:05:46] he's left totally alone he said it was
[1:05:48] hell on Earth he had nothing and he was
[1:05:50] repenting and asking God for
[1:05:54] help and he rep
[1:05:56] repented and when he
[1:05:59] repented uh we go he goes to the next
[1:06:02] meeting goes up to Oregon I believe it
[1:06:04] was when he goes up to Oregon after
[1:06:05] repented he calls for the he calls for
[1:06:07] the prayer line he tells everybody
[1:06:09] what's happened he doesn't know if it's
[1:06:10] going to work anymore amen and calls for
[1:06:12] the first person to come through the
[1:06:14] prayer line and all of the sudden the
[1:06:16] gift works it operates they're delivered
[1:06:18] and he says they brought five I think it
[1:06:19] was five children over from the deaf
[1:06:22] school that were hard of hearing are no
[1:06:24] totally deaf and every one of them was
[1:06:27] healed amen praise God the question I
[1:06:32] have is if God will stop him from
[1:06:34] smoking and God will stop him from
[1:06:36] drinking why won't God stop him from
[1:06:38] doing this that'll actually leave two
[1:06:41] people Stone
[1:06:46] death I don't
[1:06:48] know but I know God's perfect in all of
[1:06:51] his ways and the reality is I don't know
[1:06:54] I don't know some may know in the
[1:06:56] message and have studied it out and know
[1:06:58] I don't know if those two people ever
[1:07:00] got their hearing back I don't know why
[1:07:04] would God prevent the prophet from
[1:07:06] making a mistake on one hand and allow
[1:07:08] him to walk right into it after warning
[1:07:10] him on another hand why would he do that
[1:07:13] the only thing that I know is God will
[1:07:15] not defeat his own purpose I know that
[1:07:18] God will not defeat his own purpose and
[1:07:20] if something will hinder stop uh God's
[1:07:23] purpose God will stop it but if
[1:07:25] something will work into God's purpose
[1:07:27] he will allow
[1:07:28] it and there were many things that the
[1:07:31] prophet of God needed to learn I don't
[1:07:33] know what all God was doing I'm not
[1:07:34] trying listen I'm I I pray that God will
[1:07:37] get me Beyond The Way Beyond and the
[1:07:40] fallacy of saying I know why he did
[1:07:42] these
[1:07:43] things I don't know all the reasons why
[1:07:46] he did these things there's probably
[1:07:48] more reasons than we could calculate for
[1:07:51] why he did everything he did because you
[1:07:54] know everything that happened in life
[1:07:55] with that Prophet you and I hear and
[1:07:57] when we hear it it does something
[1:07:58] different for all of us and it has an
[1:08:00] effect in us how can you calculate what
[1:08:02] God allowed or didn't allow and the
[1:08:04] effect that it has on another generation
[1:08:06] as they listen to the text you can't
[1:08:08] calculate or measure what God is doing
[1:08:10] with every
[1:08:11] circumstance in our lives in our church
[1:08:14] in the prophet's life in the world
[1:08:16] there's no it's it's it's not I don't
[1:08:18] believe it's measurable and I don't
[1:08:19] believe it's comprehendable by a human
[1:08:22] mind but how this is what I'm thinking
[1:08:25] how how could he say you know he's going
[1:08:27] to smoke a cigarette and there's only
[1:08:29] three other people
[1:08:31] present and he stops
[1:08:34] him but he's going to he's going his
[1:08:38] failure is going to cause two people
[1:08:40] heart of hearing to be completely death
[1:08:41] and God doesn't stop him he just warns
[1:08:44] him well he already warned him about the
[1:08:46] smoking too the angel of Lord said don't
[1:08:49] smoke don't drink or defile so he was
[1:08:51] already warned yeah so why has It
[1:08:54] Happened One Way way one time and
[1:08:56] something completely different the other
[1:08:57] time all I can say is God has a
[1:09:01] purpose and everything works towards his
[1:09:11] purpose what about the
[1:09:14] time he overworked
[1:09:21] himself and had to leave the field
[1:09:26] he was having a Ministry that was
[1:09:29] healing multitudes of
[1:09:32] people but he said I mishandled the
[1:09:35] gift he made another
[1:09:38] mistake and in that mistake his body got
[1:09:41] run down when his body got run down he
[1:09:43] had a nervous breakdown and he had to
[1:09:45] leave the field and he was months or a
[1:09:47] period of time I don't remember the
[1:09:48] period of time that he couldn't take
[1:09:50] campaigns and he couldn't go on and even
[1:09:53] his campaign managers and some of his
[1:09:54] friends thought he was washed up and the
[1:09:56] ministry was over and they tried to move
[1:09:57] on with his tent and move on with his
[1:09:59] magazine without
[1:10:01] him and and in that period of Time how
[1:10:05] many people weren't
[1:10:07] healed how many people didn't hear the
[1:10:09] gospel how many people didn't witness a
[1:10:11] living
[1:10:12] God the effect the effect of of of not
[1:10:18] going out was
[1:10:21] tremendous and you say what why would
[1:10:24] God stop him on one
[1:10:27] hand but allow him to overwork himself
[1:10:30] and get into a situation where he can't
[1:10:32] go on and he's left the field and
[1:10:34] doesn't know if he'll ever preach again
[1:10:37] and multitudes
[1:10:39] suffering why because it must serve his
[1:10:44] purpose it's the only thing that's the I
[1:10:48] mean I I I don't know how to explain
[1:10:51] there's no explanation for it the only
[1:10:52] thing I can the only thing I can
[1:10:54] understand from my little bit of finite
[1:10:57] understanding is that God's purpose will
[1:10:59] never be defeated if it would defeat his
[1:11:01] purpose he wouldn't allow it if he
[1:11:03] allows it it must go along with his
[1:11:07] purpose why didn't he stop the Fall In
[1:11:09] the Garden of Eden he could stop
[1:11:11] anything he stopped all kinds of people
[1:11:13] from making mistakes he has put the
[1:11:15] brakes on he's changed circumstances he
[1:11:17] stopped why didn't he stop the Fall In
[1:11:19] the Garden of Eden Hey listen I don't
[1:11:21] know about you but I'm suffering because
[1:11:22] of that decision the whole world is
[1:11:25] suffering every human that's ever been
[1:11:27] on this Earth is suffering because of
[1:11:28] what happened in the Garden of Eden
[1:11:30] we're under a curse we're burned under a
[1:11:31] curse we live all of our lives in a
[1:11:33] cursed body amen all because of
[1:11:36] something that happened why didn't he
[1:11:37] stop it the only reason I know according
[1:11:39] to what the prophet said is that fall
[1:11:42] worked together for his
[1:11:44] purpose so God allowed it amen why did
[1:11:48] Abraham fail his wife in such a way that
[1:11:50] he would go down to guar and lie and
[1:11:52] sell out his wife and listen brother
[1:11:56] Abraham is the chosen vessel of God Amen
[1:11:59] he is the going to be the father of
[1:12:01] Faith the father of Nations from his
[1:12:03] loin are is going to come the seed line
[1:12:05] amen all of this stuff is going on in
[1:12:08] Abraham after meeting God after a body
[1:12:11] change after all of these things he goes
[1:12:13] down to
[1:12:16] guar and he fails his
[1:12:19] wife he fails God CU he shouldn't have
[1:12:21] been down there anyways should have
[1:12:23] stayed in the land amen that what the
[1:12:25] prophet tells
[1:12:27] us and and all of these things transpire
[1:12:31] and then
[1:12:32] God listen God comes on the
[1:12:36] scene God comes on the scene to aimc and
[1:12:39] says don't you know you're about to take
[1:12:40] a a man's wife he said Lord you know the
[1:12:42] Integrity of my heart I
[1:12:44] didn't why didn't God stop Abraham from
[1:12:47] going to
[1:12:48] Gar if he could show up and talk to a
[1:12:51] heathen King couldn't he have talked to
[1:12:53] Abraham how many times did he talked to
[1:12:56] Abraham if he told Abraham don't go to
[1:12:58] Gar I don't believe Abraham would have
[1:13:02] went so why did it happen this way why
[1:13:07] didn't he stop him from making a mistake
[1:13:09] why didn't he stop him from hurting
[1:13:10] Sarah's feelings why didn't he stop from
[1:13:12] bringing trouble to the whole nation of
[1:13:13] gar the whole nation was under a curse
[1:13:15] because of this thing because God had
[1:13:17] already stopped the wounds of animal and
[1:13:19] servant and everybody the whole nation
[1:13:22] was troubled because of Abraham's
[1:13:23] decision Sarah was troubled because of
[1:13:25] Abraham decisions the whole promise of
[1:13:27] God looked like it was in Jeopardy
[1:13:29] because of the decision of Abraham aon's
[1:13:32] life was in Jeopardy because of the
[1:13:33] decision of Abraham why didn't God stop
[1:13:35] Abraham from making the
[1:13:39] decision but he come to a heathen King
[1:13:43] and he said listen this whole thing's
[1:13:44] bad don't do
[1:13:45] it
[1:13:47] right all I can say friends is it must
[1:13:49] have served God's
[1:13:51] purpose and you realize we stand here
[1:13:54] and I don't know all that God was
[1:13:55] accomplishing and all that was happening
[1:13:57] amen it may take us the entire eternity
[1:13:59] to understand it but one thing I know
[1:14:01] for sure is that's the only scripture
[1:14:03] brother Brenham has to show that they
[1:14:05] had a body
[1:14:08] change cuz brother Brenham comes to that
[1:14:10] scripture and says see that King could
[1:14:12] have any Fair young virgin he wants but
[1:14:14] he wants Grandma Sarah coming down
[1:14:16] because God had just changed their
[1:14:17] bodies in that meeting in Genesis 18 and
[1:14:20] now they come down to Guerrera that is
[1:14:22] reading between the lines that's what
[1:14:25] God place so that a prophet could pick
[1:14:26] it up 4,000 or some years later and say
[1:14:29] see there was a body change Abraham
[1:14:31] probably never knew why God allowed that
[1:14:34] mistake in his life but we're looking
[1:14:35] back saying I'm so glad he went to Gar
[1:14:38] I'm so thankful that he went down there
[1:14:40] and all that transpired so I can see
[1:14:43] what God has in store for
[1:14:48] me was it a mistake yes was it costly
[1:14:51] yes did people suffer yes
[1:14:57] did it work for God's
[1:15:02] purpose listen I don't
[1:15:05] know I look at these things and I say I
[1:15:07] just don't
[1:15:09] know so we look at Abraham and we look
[1:15:12] at Moses and we look at brother brandham
[1:15:14] but and and and yeah that's wonderful we
[1:15:17] see absolutely that was
[1:15:19] God but what about me and
[1:15:23] you you know there's time s in our life
[1:15:25] that God has interjected himself in our
[1:15:27] life and stopped us turned us he's
[1:15:31] closed doors he's opened doors has he
[1:15:35] done it for you has there been times
[1:15:38] that God absolutely worked a situation
[1:15:40] out for you that you would have got in
[1:15:41] trouble or something bad would happen if
[1:15:43] it wasn't for God injecting himself in
[1:15:45] the
[1:15:47] situation but how many of us have made
[1:15:49] terrible
[1:15:50] mistakes that have cost us terrible
[1:15:54] consequences
[1:15:55] and not just hurt us but the ones that
[1:15:57] hurt us the most are the ones that hurt
[1:15:58] other people where our actions have hurt
[1:16:02] others and caused pain and caused
[1:16:10] suffering and then the question is God
[1:16:12] why did you stop me then and you didn't
[1:16:14] stop me
[1:16:15] then why did you come down why I mean
[1:16:19] there's times friends that God so
[1:16:21] supernaturally does something it takes
[1:16:23] our breath away
[1:16:25] he speaks to us he'll have somebody say
[1:16:28] something to us that nobody else in the
[1:16:30] world knows he'll have something come
[1:16:32] over the pull pit that only you and God
[1:16:33] knows you'll have something that is so
[1:16:35] Supernatural there's no mistaking this
[1:16:37] is God stopping me turning me moving
[1:16:42] me then you'll have other times where
[1:16:45] you keep trucking down the wrong path
[1:16:47] and God doesn't say anything he just let
[1:16:49] you
[1:16:51] go and you keep going down and you keep
[1:16:54] moving and you get settled in the fact
[1:16:56] that this must be okay with God and and
[1:16:58] you know he's fine with it he's fine
[1:17:00] with it you're going down we've been
[1:17:01] warned before in the word we've been
[1:17:02] warn in the message but we're moving on
[1:17:04] then all of a sudden everything falls
[1:17:08] apart and we I don't believe I'm the
[1:17:11] only human being amongst us but then we
[1:17:14] always say God why didn't you stop
[1:17:18] me why didn't you stop me
[1:17:27] well maybe it's going to serve God's
[1:17:30] purpose prise God prise
[1:17:33] God
[1:17:35] maybe
[1:17:36] somehow it'll serve God's
[1:17:39] purpose that doesn't mean we don't
[1:17:42] suffer that doesn't mean that the
[1:17:43] suffering doesn't
[1:17:45] continue some of those mistakes brother
[1:17:47] brenon made for himself and that
[1:17:49] affected himself and others the
[1:17:52] consequences continued on
[1:17:56] sometimes the mistakes that we've made
[1:17:57] the consequences continue on and are
[1:17:59] continuing on
[1:18:01] today some of us are still feeling the
[1:18:03] pain of mistakes that we've made
[1:18:07] amen but that doesn't change God's
[1:18:09] purpose in our
[1:18:12] life brother B said in present stage of
[1:18:14] my
[1:18:17] Ministry says didn't Jesus say I I do
[1:18:20] nothing till the father shows me first
[1:18:22] haven't I told you years ago with my own
[1:18:24] mother was laying dying and would say
[1:18:26] Bill What's My outcome I couldn't say
[1:18:28] nothing till God said so first and
[1:18:31] that's just what happened man can't man
[1:18:33] is a failure to begin with he's only an
[1:18:36] agent to which God works through and God
[1:18:39] works his own will but when you see
[1:18:42] these super duper people that always
[1:18:43] having this and that and the other you'd
[1:18:46] better stay away from it Jesus himself
[1:18:49] didn't do that said I only work as the
[1:18:51] father Works he shows me what to do and
[1:18:53] then I go and do it it anything
[1:18:56] otherwise I can't do anything otherwise
[1:18:58] than that man's a
[1:19:00] failure sometimes we
[1:19:03] don't well you think about um Elijah
[1:19:08] Elijah on Mount
[1:19:10] Carmel I
[1:19:11] mean I would love to see a video of
[1:19:14] Elijah on Mount
[1:19:16] Caramel it was one of the highlights of
[1:19:19] the
[1:19:19] Bible standing there with bold
[1:19:22] confidence in the face of all kinds of
[1:19:24] resist existance 400 prophets of ba all
[1:19:26] the nation of Israel gathered together
[1:19:29] and he was standing there absolutely
[1:19:31] confident in God and knowing where God
[1:19:33] placed him and calling out for you
[1:19:36] here's what we're going to do we're
[1:19:37] going to have a showdown now we're going
[1:19:38] to find out who God really is if baal's
[1:19:40] God or if the Lord is God and you guys
[1:19:42] do your thing and we'll I'll do my thing
[1:19:44] and he rebuilds the he rebuilds the
[1:19:46] broken down altar he's restoring it back
[1:19:48] and they're doing their thing and their
[1:19:50] worship and and and it's obvious friends
[1:19:52] that they have a degree of Faith because
[1:19:54] it what they're going through to call on
[1:19:55] their
[1:19:57] God and he's mocking them and he I mean
[1:20:00] he's absolutely confident he is he is
[1:20:04] the epitome of what we all want to
[1:20:07] be the Bold Christian who knows what's
[1:20:09] going to happen as faith in God Is
[1:20:11] unwavered by anything that's happening
[1:20:13] this is what we want to be this is what
[1:20:16] image we want to have of oursel we want
[1:20:17] to live every day like this fold of your
[1:20:19] hands and say that's not going to get
[1:20:23] anywhere I know God you don't he's on my
[1:20:26] side not
[1:20:31] yours mocking them maybe you're God
[1:20:34] maybe he's on a
[1:20:36] journey so maybe you should yell louder
[1:20:38] he might be far
[1:20:40] away listen
[1:20:42] friends
[1:20:45] yeah I mean it's
[1:20:48] great goes through all the motions and
[1:20:51] they fail and it comes to the time of
[1:20:52] the evening sacrifice the appointed time
[1:20:54] time and he says you know I'm not just
[1:20:57] going to see if God will send fire down
[1:21:00] but let's pour water barrels of water
[1:21:02] over this sacrifice he lays out the wood
[1:21:04] and he lays out the sacrifice and dumps
[1:21:06] Barrel after barrel of water upon
[1:21:08] it it's soaking wet no fire came down on
[1:21:12] Earth but now he's calling for fire but
[1:21:16] he he's made it impossible with the
[1:21:18] soaking of the wood and soaking of the
[1:21:19] stones and the water gathered around the
[1:21:22] trench yeah then he says God I have done
[1:21:26] all of this at thy command
[1:21:31] yeah why was he so
[1:21:34] bold because he had super duper faith
[1:21:36] and he was a super duper Christian he
[1:21:39] was bold because God already showed him
[1:21:41] what was going to happen yeah Amen
[1:21:43] brother Bram said if God told me that he
[1:21:45] was going to raise up George Washington
[1:21:46] I'd invite everybody to come to the
[1:21:48] cemetery to watch cuz it can't
[1:21:51] fail here's Elijah no wonder he's
[1:21:54] mocking no wonder he's bold no wonder
[1:21:56] he's standing in front of all Al no
[1:21:57] wonder he's so confident God had already
[1:21:59] showed him exactly what was going to
[1:22:01] happen he was going through the motions
[1:22:03] and as he did fire came down from heaven
[1:22:05] licked up the sacrifice the wood and the
[1:22:08] stones
[1:22:10] yeah killed the 400 prophets of Baal
[1:22:13] restored Israel back to Faith in Jehovah
[1:22:15] it was a wonderful
[1:22:17] Victory what happened the next
[1:22:20] day the next day Jezebel
[1:22:24] the wife of Ahab finds out what he did
[1:22:27] and says I'm going to do to to to Elijah
[1:22:31] all that he did to the prophets of Baal
[1:22:33] so help
[1:22:34] me do you know what that bold super
[1:22:37] duper Christian
[1:22:38] did he ran away
[1:22:43] scared run away sitting under a juniper
[1:22:47] tree and he's saying God I'm no better
[1:22:50] than my fathers take my life
[1:22:57] said before I'll say again being a human
[1:22:58] being is the most pathetic thing in the
[1:23:00] face of this planet we are the most
[1:23:03] pathetic
[1:23:04] creatures CU if we would just operate by
[1:23:07] Instinct like an animal does we'd be
[1:23:08] fine we'd always do the same thing but
[1:23:10] we've got this intellectual reasoning
[1:23:12] thing in this emotional realm and we are
[1:23:14] absolutely
[1:23:16] pathetic here he runs under the juniper
[1:23:18] tree crying out God take my life I'm no
[1:23:20] better and God comes down with an
[1:23:22] Angelic visitation and feeds him and and
[1:23:24] and takes care of him and and he he goes
[1:23:26] on the strength all the way to the cave
[1:23:28] and he's in the cave and God comes by
[1:23:30] and says Elijah what doest thou here
[1:23:33] what are you doing
[1:23:35] here and Elijah goes through the WRA
[1:23:38] sheet you know because of this and this
[1:23:40] and for these reasons and I'm the only
[1:23:41] one left that's why I'm
[1:23:43] here so then God shows up in the fire
[1:23:46] and in the earthquake and in the
[1:23:48] wind shakes the whole
[1:23:51] mountain and then the still small voice
[1:23:54] and in the still Small Voice the prophet
[1:23:56] of God comes to the front of the cave
[1:23:58] with the mantle wrapped around his face
[1:24:00] and God says again Elijah what are you
[1:24:02] doing
[1:24:03] here and Elijah goes through the whole
[1:24:05] thing again because of this and the
[1:24:07] enemies and they seek my life
[1:24:10] and and God doesn't address his
[1:24:14] complaint or his fear God only addresses
[1:24:18] his purpose
[1:24:25] he doesn't say it's okay I'm with you
[1:24:28] they're not going to kill you I
[1:24:30] understand I feel sorry for no he's just
[1:24:32] saying
[1:24:33] Elijah I need you to go anoint this man
[1:24:36] to be king over Syria I need you to
[1:24:38] anoint this one to be king over and I
[1:24:39] need you to anoint Elijah to be prophet
[1:24:41] in your
[1:24:42] stad get back to your
[1:24:45] purpose hallu
[1:24:49] amen oh praise be to God Amen aot elah
[1:24:54] did what he did because God had showed
[1:24:56] him but when God hadn't showed him he
[1:24:58] was Elijah again he was a man he was
[1:25:00] prone to make mistakes he ran away from
[1:25:03] his calling he ran away from his
[1:25:04] commission he ran away to hide amen
[1:25:07] because of all the things that had
[1:25:08] transpired and all the fears and all the
[1:25:10] things that were against him but God
[1:25:12] just looked at him and says listen I
[1:25:14] need you to do this this and
[1:25:17] this why did God come to him in the cave
[1:25:20] and didn't leave him
[1:25:22] alone because God had him to do this
[1:25:25] this and
[1:25:27] this why are you still on this planet
[1:25:30] because God has a purpose in your life
[1:25:33] and mean if he could only come to us in
[1:25:34] the cave and say now listen straighten
[1:25:36] up quit sing I know you've been rejected
[1:25:38] I know you've been offended I know
[1:25:39] you've made mistakes and I know you're
[1:25:41] upset about all the things you've done
[1:25:42] but listen you got to go do this this
[1:25:44] and this still before you die
[1:25:47] right oh you know how much that would
[1:25:49] help
[1:25:50] us some of those things he doesn't
[1:25:52] necessarily tell us he may he can he can
[1:25:55] do anything he wants but if he doesn't
[1:25:57] tell us amen we just need to March
[1:25:59] forward following him day by day
[1:26:01] trusting that he's working a purpose in
[1:26:03] our life and everything in our life is
[1:26:05] working towards his purpose I'm not here
[1:26:07] without purpose I'm not here as some
[1:26:09] random thing that happened I'm a Child
[1:26:11] of God what makes me believe I'm a Child
[1:26:13] of God cuz he came to me and revealed
[1:26:16] himself to me and called me to
[1:26:18] himself I believe by faith I'm his child
[1:26:20] and if I'm his child I'm here amen for a
[1:26:23] purpose that he had before the
[1:26:24] foundation of the world and I'm not
[1:26:26] leaving here till I fulfill that
[1:26:28] purpose and there's nothing that he'll
[1:26:30] let me do that'll destroy his
[1:26:34] purpose but there may be some things he
[1:26:36] lets me do that destroys
[1:26:38] me for his
[1:26:52] purpose brother benam says and blind
[1:26:55] bmas he's praying he said our heavenly
[1:26:57] father we come approaching the Throne of
[1:26:59] Mercy we would not come approaching
[1:27:01] Justice because we could not stand it we
[1:27:04] will not approach your law because there
[1:27:06] has no Redemption but we approach Jesus
[1:27:08] who is thy mercy and we come asking for
[1:27:10] divine mercy upon us all forgive us of
[1:27:12] our shortcomings and our mistakes and
[1:27:14] the things that we have did or said or
[1:27:16] even thought that was wrong and we do
[1:27:19] not believe that we are holy
[1:27:21] Lord we believe it's not a Hool Holy
[1:27:24] Mountain but it's a holy God on the
[1:27:25] mountain not a holy church but the holy
[1:27:27] ghost in the church not a holy people
[1:27:30] but the Holy
[1:27:31] Spirit why because this part of me is a
[1:27:35] failure it's only the god part of me
[1:27:38] that can do anything right and only by
[1:27:41] the anointing of his
[1:27:48] Spirit let's let's read a couple
[1:27:50] scriptures let's go to Deuteronomy
[1:27:52] together if you can turn with me to
[1:27:53] Deuteronomy chapter
[1:27:55] Seven's some other a few just other
[1:27:57] statements that are heavy on my heart
[1:27:59] that I want to share but I want to look
[1:28:01] at a couple scriptures here
[1:28:15] first Deuteronomy chapter
[1:28:20] 7 and verse six
[1:28:26] he said for thou art a holy people unto
[1:28:29] the Lord thy God the Lord thy God ha
[1:28:31] chosen thee to be a special people unto
[1:28:33] himself above all the people that are
[1:28:36] upon the face of the Earth the Lord did
[1:28:38] not set his love upon you nor choose you
[1:28:40] because you were more in number than any
[1:28:42] people for you were the fewest of all
[1:28:44] people but because the Lord loved you
[1:28:46] and because he would keep the oath which
[1:28:48] he had sworn unto your fathers hath the
[1:28:51] Lord brought you out with a mighty hand
[1:28:53] and redeemed you out of the house of
[1:28:55] bondman from the hand of pharaoh king of
[1:28:59] Egypt when he when he brought Israel he
[1:29:01] didn't say I didn't bring you out
[1:29:04] because of
[1:29:06] you I brought you out because of me
[1:29:10] because I loved
[1:29:12] you so I when I say that because you I
[1:29:14] don't mean it wasn't because he wasn't
[1:29:16] the object of their love that that they
[1:29:18] were not the object of his love but it
[1:29:21] wasn't because of their goodness
[1:29:24] or their deeds or how right they were or
[1:29:28] their ability to believe more than other
[1:29:30] people could
[1:29:31] believe why did he call them out because
[1:29:34] he loved them and he made a promise to
[1:29:37] their fathers and he would keep his
[1:29:41] promise if that's the case then it
[1:29:44] wasn't their Good Deeds that brought
[1:29:45] them
[1:29:50] Redemption it wasn't their likability
[1:29:55] it wasn't because they were a better
[1:29:58] class of people or could fulfill the
[1:30:01] word better than another group of people
[1:30:03] could that had nothing to do with God's
[1:30:06] decision he said I chose
[1:30:08] you he chose them because he loved them
[1:30:12] and because he made a promise to their
[1:30:14] fathers and because he chose them he did
[1:30:18] what was his purpose in choosing with
[1:30:21] them not because they were great
[1:30:24] they were all failures they were a group
[1:30:28] of slaves and God has chosen us not
[1:30:33] because he knew that we would be the
[1:30:34] most likable people on the planet or the
[1:30:37] smartest or the the the most capable
[1:30:39] with the most gifts
[1:30:41] no he chose us before the foundation
[1:30:44] world because he loved
[1:30:47] us we are just as much failure to begin
[1:30:51] with as every other human being on this
[1:30:53] Earth amen amen we are in just as bad a
[1:30:58] shape as anybody else we have just as
[1:31:00] much complexes we have just as many
[1:31:03] vices we have just as many bad habits we
[1:31:05] have just as much everything as every
[1:31:07] other human being he didn't choose us
[1:31:09] because we were better he chose us
[1:31:10] because he loved
[1:31:11] us
[1:31:13] amen let's go to Ephesians chapter
[1:31:18] 1 we know this well but we just want to
[1:31:21] we we just want to keep it locked into
[1:31:23] our M Ephesians chapter
[1:31:28] 1 and we're going to look at verse
[1:31:33] three Ephesians 1 and3 blessed be the
[1:31:35] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:31:38] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:31:40] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:31:42] according as he has chosen Us in him
[1:31:45] before the foundation of the world that
[1:31:47] we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:31:49] before him in love having predestinated
[1:31:51] us unto the adoption of children by
[1:31:53] Jesus Jesus Christ to himself according
[1:31:55] to the good pleasure of his will to the
[1:31:58] praise of the glory of his grace wherein
[1:32:01] he hath made us accepted in the
[1:32:04] Beloved what made us accepted in the
[1:32:06] Beloved he made us
[1:32:09] am oh because I love God with all my
[1:32:11] heart and I no no no friends he made us
[1:32:16] accepted in the Beloved we our works did
[1:32:18] not make us accepted in the Beloved he
[1:32:20] made us accepted in the
[1:32:22] Beloved oh praise
[1:32:25] God and verse 7 in whom we have
[1:32:27] Redemption through his blood the
[1:32:28] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:32:30] riches of his grace where and Heath
[1:32:32] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[1:32:33] Prudence having made known unto us the
[1:32:35] mystery of his will according to his
[1:32:37] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[1:32:39] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:32:42] fullness of times he might gather
[1:32:43] together in one all things in Christ
[1:32:46] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:32:47] on earth even in him in whom also we
[1:32:50] have obtained an inheritance being
[1:32:52] predestinated according to the
[1:32:55] purpose of him who worketh all things
[1:32:57] after the counsel of his own
[1:33:00] will I was predestinated according to
[1:33:04] his
[1:33:05] purpose his purpose not my purpose his
[1:33:09] purpose and that means his
[1:33:11] predestination in me in his
[1:33:13] predestination has a purpose and I will
[1:33:17] fulfill that
[1:33:19] purpose brother Chad that's a bold
[1:33:21] statement No it's a real simple
[1:33:22] statement
[1:33:24] because God purposed it it's not my
[1:33:27] willpower that's going to get it done
[1:33:28] sometimes he'll do it against my
[1:33:31] willpower he'll do it when my willpower
[1:33:33] is weak he'll do it when my Will's going
[1:33:35] the wrong way but he will serve his
[1:33:37] purpose his purpose will be accomplished
[1:33:39] in my life if he has to break me he will
[1:33:43] break me if he has to inject himself
[1:33:46] supernaturally he'll inject himself
[1:33:48] supernaturally if he has to move
[1:33:50] mountains he'll move mountains because
[1:33:51] nothing will defeat his purpose
[1:33:55] it's not me it's him it's not what I do
[1:33:57] it's what he's determined to do it's not
[1:34:00] we're not here accomplishing something
[1:34:02] so that we can have a checklist of
[1:34:04] things that we accomplish we accomplish
[1:34:06] nothing he accomplished what he already
[1:34:07] determined to accomplish in our lives we
[1:34:11] are trying our best not to hinder his
[1:34:13] work and stay out of the way that's our
[1:34:16] struggle we are absolutely laboring
[1:34:18] every day to keep this flesh and this
[1:34:20] mind subject to his will and just lay
[1:34:22] ourselves dead and let him do what he
[1:34:24] wants to do because everything we try to
[1:34:26] do
[1:34:27] backfires everything we think is right
[1:34:29] ends up wrong every decision we make for
[1:34:31] what we think is going to be a good
[1:34:33] thing ends up blowing up in our face
[1:34:35] many times over because God wants us to
[1:34:37] come to the understanding this isn't
[1:34:39] about us our strength our desire it's
[1:34:41] about
[1:34:45] him and sometimes I think it's good when
[1:34:48] everything blows up in our
[1:34:50] face I think it's a good thing
[1:34:58] when God allows all of our best efforts
[1:35:01] to serve him to amount to
[1:35:04] nothing that's a
[1:35:09] blessing when God allows us to make a
[1:35:11] decision to do the right thing only to
[1:35:13] find out it was the wrong
[1:35:15] thing I believe that's a good
[1:35:20] thing when God allows us to be sifted as
[1:35:24] wheat and we make a wrong decision and
[1:35:26] we go the wrong way and we go something
[1:35:29] contrary to what his command was and he
[1:35:31] lets it go on for a period of time and
[1:35:33] we start to believe that it's
[1:35:35] okay and then our whole world comes
[1:35:37] crashing down I say that's a good
[1:35:41] thing cuz he wouldn't have permitted it
[1:35:43] if it wouldn't work to his
[1:35:49] purpose I'd say this many of us find
[1:35:53] ourselves with limitations in our lives
[1:35:55] because of our
[1:35:58] decisions we made wrong decisions that
[1:36:00] are
[1:36:01] irreversible right some of you find
[1:36:04] yourselves in because of marriage
[1:36:05] situations you have to remain single the
[1:36:07] rest of your life because of vows
[1:36:09] because of mistakes because of other
[1:36:11] people's mistakes and your
[1:36:13] mistake but I also say that's a good
[1:36:16] thing because if it didn't serve God's
[1:36:18] purpose it wouldn't be there
[1:36:25] some people have made choices that
[1:36:27] they're still suffering from but if it
[1:36:29] didn't God serve God's purpose God would
[1:36:31] have stopped it yes amen right so let it
[1:36:35] serve God's
[1:36:37] purpose it can bring condemnation to
[1:36:40] lock us up and I can't believe I made a
[1:36:42] mistake and I can't believe I did those
[1:36:43] things and I'll never be this and I'll
[1:36:45] never be that because of the decision I
[1:36:47] made you know what friends you're going
[1:36:50] to be exactly what he purposed for you
[1:36:52] to be yeah
[1:36:56] amen there's situations in life we know
[1:36:58] brother brandham says that that for a
[1:37:01] man to minister he must marry a virgin
[1:37:03] and there's things that happen in life
[1:37:05] and and a woman could defile herself and
[1:37:06] get in a situation and now find and this
[1:37:08] man finds or she finds that then now my
[1:37:11] husband can never be a minister I say
[1:37:14] that's a good
[1:37:15] thing you say why is that a good thing
[1:37:18] because if God wanted you to minister
[1:37:20] his word God would have watched over you
[1:37:22] and your wife
[1:37:24] right so that means God spared you from
[1:37:26] making a decision that would have hurt
[1:37:28] you and hurt
[1:37:30] others we get so hurt over the things
[1:37:33] we've done wrong and the decisions we've
[1:37:35] made and we put we've got limitations in
[1:37:37] our life and barriers now because of
[1:37:39] wrong decisions and we've got Financial
[1:37:41] barriers because we made wrong decisions
[1:37:43] we didn't do things when we should have
[1:37:44] when we're young and now we're stuck in
[1:37:46] a situation that we're stuck in for
[1:37:48] financial reasons or or we took on too
[1:37:50] much debt and we shouldn't have done it
[1:37:52] it was foolish and now I'm buried under
[1:37:54] a load of dead or now I've got this
[1:37:56] situation or that situation and I say at
[1:37:59] the end of the
[1:38:01] day is God's purpose in your life going
[1:38:04] to be
[1:38:06] disrupted maybe the mistake works
[1:38:09] together for his
[1:38:10] purpose maybe the limitation that's in
[1:38:13] our life stops us from going outside his
[1:38:15] purpose for our life but it keeps us in
[1:38:19] line with his
[1:38:20] purpose do it hurt yes it hurts will it
[1:38:24] always hurt
[1:38:26] probably but let it work together for
[1:38:28] good
[1:38:30] friends the one thing we can't do is say
[1:38:33] because of this I can't be a child of
[1:38:35] God show me that in the
[1:38:37] Bible and because of this God can't use
[1:38:39] me show me that in the Bible amen right
[1:38:43] because I failed this God can never use
[1:38:45] me I'm such a failure God's in the habit
[1:38:47] of using failures God I don't know if
[1:38:50] you've read the Bible recently but God
[1:38:53] is in the habit of using people who make
[1:38:55] big mistakes not little mistakes big
[1:38:58] mistakes you look at the life of David
[1:39:00] King David I mean there's mistake after
[1:39:02] mistake after mistake and when he would
[1:39:04] go to make a mistake God would
[1:39:06] absolutely stop him remember he went to
[1:39:08] the Philistine King amen because he got
[1:39:10] tired of Saul chasing him and throwing
[1:39:12] Spears at him and trying to kill him so
[1:39:14] he goes to the Philistine King and now
[1:39:16] he's so angry and so upset he's lost his
[1:39:18] whole purpose and now he's the
[1:39:20] Philistine King's going to go fight
[1:39:22] against Saul and the armies of is is and
[1:39:23] David says I'll just go with you they've
[1:39:26] rejected me I'll kill them
[1:39:32] too you know what that's his free moral
[1:39:34] agency right he's decided they've
[1:39:37] rejected me they don't want me they've
[1:39:39] cast me out you've welcomed me I'll go
[1:39:41] with you to fight the Israelites then
[1:39:43] all of a sudden God has all the all the
[1:39:46] princes of the Philistines turn against
[1:39:49] David and go to the king and says you
[1:39:51] can't do this what he'll do is he'll
[1:39:53] over there he'll start fighting with
[1:39:54] Israel and turn against us and we'll be
[1:39:56] wiped out and so they send him
[1:39:59] back the king turned him back and said
[1:40:02] you go back David was going he made his
[1:40:04] decision his decision was going to go
[1:40:06] fight Israel but God couldn't have him
[1:40:08] kill an Israelite amen because he was
[1:40:10] going to be the king of the Israelites
[1:40:12] he was called to Shepherd them and under
[1:40:13] that anointing God couldn't allow that
[1:40:16] because of God's
[1:40:18] purpose so God worked the circumstances
[1:40:20] to send him back
[1:40:24] thank God God had people on the scene
[1:40:27] God turned the situation God worked it
[1:40:29] all out and God delivered David from
[1:40:31] doing something that would have hurt
[1:40:33] David Hurt Israel and hurt God's
[1:40:37] purpose but years later there come a
[1:40:39] time that Kings went out to battle and
[1:40:42] David stayed
[1:40:43] home and he saw a woman bathing herself
[1:40:46] on her Housetop and lust began to burn
[1:40:48] within him and he took her and lay with
[1:40:51] her and then she became pregnant then
[1:40:53] had her husband killed and all of this
[1:40:55] stuff
[1:40:59] happened God could turn the hearts of
[1:41:01] the Philistines to save David from doing
[1:41:03] something outside God's will why didn't
[1:41:06] God do something to stop
[1:41:10] David I mean God had already done what
[1:41:12] he should do he gave him the Commandment
[1:41:14] Thou shalt not I mean thou sht not take
[1:41:17] thy the neighbor's wife like it was
[1:41:19] already there it was on the tablets of
[1:41:21] stone that he gave Moses it was embedded
[1:41:23] in the law God had already warned him
[1:41:25] and told him but why didn't God stop him
[1:41:27] why didn't God just go arrest him and
[1:41:29] make him not do something that was going
[1:41:31] to be so harmful to him to this lineage
[1:41:34] after him for the whole
[1:41:36] nation I don't know how to figure that
[1:41:38] one out if you figure it out come and
[1:41:40] tell
[1:41:41] me God could stop David from taking
[1:41:44] Saul's life with the Integrity of his
[1:41:45] heart he had so much Integrity that he
[1:41:47] wouldn't kill what the man who was
[1:41:50] trying to kill him he had so much
[1:41:52] respect and honor for God and God's
[1:41:54] anointing that he wouldn't kill him but
[1:41:56] how could he not have respect and honor
[1:41:57] for the laws of God when he took a
[1:41:59] neighbor's
[1:42:00] wife
[1:42:04] yeah did he suffer yes did other people
[1:42:08] suffer
[1:42:10] yes was it tragic yes was it hurtful yes
[1:42:15] did it create a whole pile of problems
[1:42:18] yes did it work together for God's
[1:42:21] purpose yes
[1:42:25] I can't explain it friends I don't even
[1:42:27] want to try to explain it if I try to
[1:42:29] explain it I'll ruin it all we can do is
[1:42:32] look at it and say God I don't
[1:42:35] understand but I believe with all my
[1:42:37] heart you're working your
[1:42:39] purpose in my
[1:42:41] life done things I regret brother venam
[1:42:44] comes to the end of his life I mean not
[1:42:46] the end of his life but in his life he
[1:42:47] done things that he
[1:42:50] regretted he regretted not going out out
[1:42:53] when God first called him to go out he
[1:42:56] lost so much friends that he suffered
[1:42:59] with go listen to his life story and see
[1:43:01] the man weeping hear him Weeping at the
[1:43:03] end of the
[1:43:05] tape because he didn't obey God and he
[1:43:07] listened to his
[1:43:09] mother-in-law all that he lost and all
[1:43:11] that have
[1:43:14] happened but you know what he didn't
[1:43:16] stop serving
[1:43:19] God he didn't quit fulfilling his
[1:43:22] purpose
[1:43:24] he messed up the first pool in the
[1:43:25] second pool he got burned out in the
[1:43:28] first pool because of uh the healing
[1:43:30] Ministries and and had a nervous
[1:43:33] condition had nervous breakdown had to
[1:43:34] leave the field for a while but when God
[1:43:36] healed him he went right back he failed
[1:43:39] in South Africa to obey God and he
[1:43:41] listened to the ministers and he wound
[1:43:42] up with an amoeba and all kinds of bad
[1:43:45] things but he didn't quit serving
[1:43:48] God he messed up over and over and over
[1:43:51] again and he had mistakes he had
[1:43:53] apologize for he comes in standing in
[1:43:54] the Gap and he got hurt feelings and he
[1:43:56] and he W was had lost the feeling for
[1:43:58] the people and he left the sick people
[1:44:00] lay and he was going to go fulfill his
[1:44:02] plans and he had to come back and
[1:44:03] apologize for it but he didn't stop
[1:44:05] serving
[1:44:07] God and I don't care what has transpired
[1:44:10] in our lives the purpose of God will
[1:44:13] still be
[1:44:16] fulfilled doesn't matter what there's
[1:44:19] nothing that we could do that will
[1:44:21] override God's purpose that's humanistic
[1:44:24] thinking that's reasoning to start
[1:44:26] thinking I've done this and now God will
[1:44:27] never use me I thought I was going to
[1:44:29] have a gift I thought I was going to
[1:44:30] have a position and now I'm not going to
[1:44:31] have that because I did this God will
[1:44:33] never you how could the plan of God Be
[1:44:35] thed by a measly human
[1:44:39] being nothing in the Bible has ever
[1:44:42] stopped at God's plan from coming forth
[1:44:45] I say nothing
[1:44:46] will let's turn to Romans chapter 9
[1:44:49] together
[1:45:07] Romans 9
[1:45:11] and6 not as though the word of God ha
[1:45:14] taken none effect for they are not all
[1:45:15] of Israel which are of Israel neither
[1:45:17] because they all Seed of Abraham are
[1:45:19] they all children but in Isaac shall thy
[1:45:21] seed be called that is they which are
[1:45:23] the children of the flesh these are not
[1:45:25] the children of God but the children of
[1:45:27] the promise are counted for seed for
[1:45:29] This Is The Word of Promise at this time
[1:45:31] will I come and Sarah shall have a son
[1:45:33] and not only this but when Rebecca also
[1:45:35] had conceived by one even by Our Father
[1:45:37] Isaac for the children being not yet
[1:45:39] born neither having done any good or
[1:45:41] evil that the purpose of God according
[1:45:43] to election might stand not of works but
[1:45:46] of him that calleth it was said unto her
[1:45:48] the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it
[1:45:50] is written Jacob have I loved but Esau
[1:45:53] all have I hated what shall we say then
[1:45:56] is there unrighteousness with God God
[1:45:58] forbid for he saith to Moses I will have
[1:46:01] mercy on whom I will have mercy and I
[1:46:03] will have compassion on whom I will have
[1:46:05] compassion so then it is not of him that
[1:46:07] willth nor of him that runneth but of
[1:46:10] God that showeth
[1:46:12] Mercy it's God's plan God's calling
[1:46:15] God's purpose God's
[1:46:17] desire and all I want to say is God let
[1:46:20] me fulfill your desire
[1:46:23] we've had a lot of rough roads behind us
[1:46:26] a lot of bad decisions and a lot of
[1:46:28] consequences for those but if the devil
[1:46:31] starts to beat us up and think you can
[1:46:32] never do this you can never be this or
[1:46:34] will never be this because of what
[1:46:36] you've done just remind them say God has
[1:46:38] supernaturally worked in my life and he
[1:46:40] could have stopped any of that so I'm
[1:46:42] going to let God work all of that to his
[1:46:45] purpose amen and if there's limitations
[1:46:47] in my life because of decisions I made
[1:46:49] then praise God God wanted a barrier in
[1:46:52] my life so I wouldn't go that way but I
[1:46:53] would go this way amen praise be to God
[1:46:57] God works all things according to the
[1:46:59] counsel of his own
[1:47:03] will here's what brother M said in the
[1:47:05] message
[1:47:06] Oneness we know we make mistakes but you
[1:47:10] mustn't look at that it's not your
[1:47:12] mistakes because you're always going to
[1:47:14] have them but you see it's following his
[1:47:17] rules following what he said to do
[1:47:19] stumble and falling doesn't have one
[1:47:21] thing to do with it a real true servant
[1:47:23] if he stumble he'll get up again if he
[1:47:26] wobbles God pulls him right back in the
[1:47:28] path as long as he's in the path of Duty
[1:47:30] but if he's off the path of Duty God's
[1:47:32] not obligated to him but as long as he's
[1:47:34] in the path of Duty God's obligated to
[1:47:36] him knowing that he's just a man or a
[1:47:38] woman he's obligated to that person as
[1:47:40] long as they're in the path of Duty
[1:47:42] what's the path of Duty God I'm here to
[1:47:44] serve you I'm here to fulfill your
[1:47:46] purpose sometimes I don't know if this
[1:47:48] step's the right step and this step
[1:47:49] maybe is the wrong step but I believe If
[1:47:52] I Stumble and fall I'll get right back
[1:47:53] because you're obligated to help me cuz
[1:47:55] what I want to do is your
[1:47:57] will I've done many things that weren't
[1:47:59] as will but I I I was trying I wanted to
[1:48:02] serve God I was doing my best many
[1:48:04] failures and mistakes but praise God God
[1:48:06] has been faithful to pull us out of the
[1:48:08] allall friends we're still here today
[1:48:11] we're still serving God we've had some
[1:48:13] horrific things that we've been through
[1:48:15] and some things that we've done to
[1:48:16] ourselves and others have done to us but
[1:48:18] praise God we're here serving his
[1:48:20] purpose how did that hen how can you
[1:48:22] compute all of that with everything that
[1:48:24] we've been through if we go through the
[1:48:26] room and run everybody's scenario and
[1:48:27] all the bad things and the circumstances
[1:48:29] and the decisions and the hurtful things
[1:48:31] and we're all here serving God's purpose
[1:48:33] how did that happen because he
[1:48:35] determined it before the foundation of
[1:48:36] the world and everything is working for
[1:48:38] his
[1:48:44] purpose brother I'm going to finish with
[1:48:46] this last two these last couple thoughts
[1:48:50] here brother bam we know the interview
[1:48:53] of sister Bruce really well we've been
[1:48:54] through it
[1:48:55] before but sister Bruce says I make so
[1:48:59] many mistakes and I fail so many
[1:49:03] times here's what brother Ram said
[1:49:05] here's a woman who's a Christian woman
[1:49:07] brother R said I believe you to be a
[1:49:08] real Christian I've watched your
[1:49:10] life and she's struggling with her
[1:49:15] mistakes and brother R says she said I
[1:49:17] make so many mistakes I fail so many
[1:49:19] times he said that's why Christ had to
[1:49:22] die
[1:49:23] so that you with your mistakes it
[1:49:24] wouldn't be lotted to you he took your
[1:49:27] mistakes your desire in your heart is to
[1:49:30] serve him sister Bruce says yes all
[1:49:33] right that's what he died for so you
[1:49:36] could serve him now your mistakes are
[1:49:38] not looked not lotted to you he's your
[1:49:41] propitiation he is your sin offering
[1:49:44] your sins are not known you're not a
[1:49:46] sinner before God Christ took your sins
[1:49:48] and become you because your desire is to
[1:49:51] serve him
[1:49:53] question is is your desire to serve
[1:49:57] him made mistakes can you say like
[1:50:00] sister Bruce I've made so many mistakes
[1:50:03] absolutely made so many
[1:50:05] mistakes but that's why Christ died for
[1:50:08] my mistakes so I could still serve him
[1:50:12] because in this life there had to be
[1:50:14] mistakes Peter had to make a mistake
[1:50:19] others had to make mistakes things had
[1:50:21] to happen brother B had to do certain
[1:50:23] things he had to do you're like why why
[1:50:25] did he have to do it I can explain to
[1:50:27] you why but if it defeated God's purpose
[1:50:29] he wouldn't have done
[1:50:32] it he says in Hebrews the Hebrew series
[1:50:35] says you'll make mistakes you'll fall
[1:50:37] you'll willfully do wrong you'll go out
[1:50:40] sometimes and do things that don't mean
[1:50:42] you're
[1:50:43] lost that means you're going to get
[1:50:47] corrected I love how simple that you say
[1:50:49] but I did wrong and I did it
[1:50:51] premeditated I knew it was wrong and I
[1:50:52] did it anyways well well praise God
[1:50:54] you're going to get
[1:50:56] corrected and that correction will also
[1:50:58] work together for God's
[1:51:01] purpose he goes and the testimony upon
[1:51:03] the sea he says that's the reason our
[1:51:05] sins today would be everyone condemned
[1:51:07] but God can't take us because if he does
[1:51:10] he hurts Christ we're part of him we're
[1:51:12] the bride don't you see so there it is
[1:51:14] so Grace holds us in our mistakes until
[1:51:17] we can see better I love that statement
[1:51:21] we're making mistakes we're doing wrong
[1:51:23] sometime we've repeated the same
[1:51:24] mistakes over but his grace is holding
[1:51:26] us up in our mistakes till we can see
[1:51:29] better we're going to learn something
[1:51:31] we're going to see something better and
[1:51:33] until we learn the lesson or see what
[1:51:35] we're supposed to see grace is holding
[1:51:37] us up even in our
[1:51:39] mistakes aren't you glad for God's
[1:51:42] grace I can be making mistake after
[1:51:45] mistake after mistake but he's holding
[1:51:47] me up because why I've got to see
[1:51:50] something and when I see something then
[1:51:51] that's going to all be worth
[1:51:55] it now this this blessed
[1:51:59] me 1962 questions and answers this is a
[1:52:02] question brother Benham got said I lived
[1:52:04] many years in sin until I found the Lord
[1:52:07] please brother Benham I have sinned
[1:52:09] again I'm not worthy to come before you
[1:52:12] in this holy place please tell me if I
[1:52:14] can be restored holy again please help
[1:52:16] me brother brandom I have a devil in me
[1:52:18] help me will you lay your hands upon me
[1:52:20] and restore me again
[1:52:23] so now there is a question I never
[1:52:24] noticed it when I read it a while ago
[1:52:26] there's a question now if that person is
[1:52:28] present let me just read it to you I
[1:52:31] have lived many years in sin until I
[1:52:34] found the
[1:52:35] Lord please brother benam I have sinned
[1:52:38] again and I'm not worthy to come before
[1:52:41] you in this holy Place te tell me if I
[1:52:42] can be restored whole again so somebody
[1:52:45] who lived a life of sin until they were
[1:52:47] saved and come to the Lord and it looks
[1:52:50] like it sounds like they've repeated the
[1:52:52] same thing again they've sinned
[1:52:55] again they don't think they're worthy to
[1:52:58] even come before brother brandham and
[1:52:59] the church and they want to know if they
[1:53:01] can be restored and if brother BR lay
[1:53:03] hands on
[1:53:04] them and here's his answer
[1:53:09] yes yes period I love that before the
[1:53:13] explanation is the
[1:53:14] answer before any explan this person who
[1:53:17] wrote this you can pick up the turmoil
[1:53:19] in the way they wrote it I'm not even
[1:53:21] worthy to come like they're completely
[1:53:22] distraught they're flat on I mean
[1:53:24] they're flat on their belly on the
[1:53:26] ground if we would say that emotionally
[1:53:27] they have absolutely done what they
[1:53:29] never thought they would do again or
[1:53:30] what the lifestyle they had completely
[1:53:32] left and they've done it again they're
[1:53:34] not worthy to even come before brother
[1:53:36] brandom in this holy place of the church
[1:53:38] they want to know if they can be
[1:53:38] restored and brother B will lay hands on
[1:53:40] them and then the second question is
[1:53:43] what he reads is please tell me if I can
[1:53:45] be restored whole
[1:53:47] again he says
[1:53:51] yes he says you have not sined my friend
[1:53:54] so far in God but what you could be
[1:53:57] restored listen if you had sinned so far
[1:54:01] that you could not be restored you would
[1:54:03] never want to be
[1:54:06] restored right see but as long as
[1:54:10] there's something dealing with your
[1:54:12] heart you're still in line of
[1:54:15] restoration guilty of the least is
[1:54:17] guilty of the whole I have sinned many
[1:54:19] times every day every one of us do
[1:54:21] things that we don't want to
[1:54:24] do can you be restored yes how do you
[1:54:28] know because you want to be
[1:54:31] restored how many of us have the same
[1:54:33] testimony of whoever wrote this out I'd
[1:54:35] lived in sin many years so I come to the
[1:54:37] Lord but I sinned again and sometimes I
[1:54:39] sinned again with the same the very same
[1:54:42] thing that was the trap for me before
[1:54:44] can I be restored I'm not worthy of he
[1:54:46] says there's no way you've gone so far
[1:54:48] in God that you can't be restored
[1:54:51] because if you went that far that you
[1:54:53] couldn't be restored you would no longer
[1:54:55] have a desire to be restored right the
[1:54:58] very desire to be restored is the
[1:55:01] evidence you can be restored amen right
[1:55:05] listen there's no matter what's happened
[1:55:07] in your life and what decision you made
[1:55:09] and what wrong thing you've done you may
[1:55:11] have repeated a sin you thought you
[1:55:12] would never repeat in your life but
[1:55:14] listen he loved you before you sin the
[1:55:16] first time and his love is never going
[1:55:18] to change no matter how time many times
[1:55:20] you repeat the same thing because his
[1:55:22] his love was fixed before and his
[1:55:24] purpose was fixed before will you suffer
[1:55:27] yes will there be consequences yes will
[1:55:30] correction come absolutely but but
[1:55:32] you'll never be Beyond Redemption as
[1:55:34] long as you still want
[1:55:38] Redemption that's the devil that's lying
[1:55:41] telling you you've gone so far that God
[1:55:43] won't hear your prayer you can't be
[1:55:44] restored or God can't use you
[1:55:46] anymore then why are you still here and
[1:55:49] why do you have a desire to serve him
[1:55:51] why do you still love you but why do you
[1:55:53] still want to be whole why do you still
[1:55:54] want to display Christ to the world if
[1:55:56] you're not going to be restored if God
[1:55:57] doesn't have a purpose in your
[1:55:59] life remember God's not doing anything
[1:56:02] in vain everything is for his
[1:56:08] purpose this I want you to think of this
[1:56:11] quote as I read this in the message and
[1:56:13] knoweth it not 65
[1:56:16] 1965 now this outside man is the flesh
[1:56:19] that's what we look at what we see and
[1:56:22] has five inlets to the body and any
[1:56:24] grammar school child as myself would
[1:56:25] know there's five senses controlling the
[1:56:27] body see taste feel smell and here
[1:56:29] without that you can't touch the body
[1:56:31] that's the only way you have to the
[1:56:34] body now that this is what I want you to
[1:56:37] understand now that is the evil
[1:56:41] one on the
[1:56:44] outside
[1:56:46] what where is the evil
[1:56:49] one he's lurking in
[1:56:53] uh drug houses and he's moving in houses
[1:56:56] of prostitution and no where's the evil
[1:57:01] one I'm living inside the evil
[1:57:05] one born wrong born in sin come into the
[1:57:09] world speaking lies the one that has a
[1:57:12] sticky ccer nature that's going to
[1:57:13] trouble me the rest of my life
[1:57:22] we are set up for
[1:57:29] failure why did God not stop the
[1:57:31] fall because it worked for his
[1:57:35] purpose brother B said you can never
[1:57:37] understand God and all the attributes of
[1:57:39] God against the backdrop of white but
[1:57:43] white doesn't stand out against white so
[1:57:44] if everything was perfect we wouldn't
[1:57:46] understand a perfect God we wouldn't
[1:57:49] understand a God who can heal and a God
[1:57:50] who can deliver and a God who can save
[1:57:53] but he said White shows up against the
[1:57:55] contrast of black so God will allow man
[1:57:57] to fall to create the
[1:57:59] contrast and in the contrast we will
[1:58:02] understand God and all his Holiness his
[1:58:03] righteousness his salvation his
[1:58:05] Deliverance his
[1:58:09] healing why did God let us make
[1:58:13] mistakes maybe we needed a
[1:58:16] contrast of
[1:58:18] black in our own lives
[1:58:22] so that we would know the difference
[1:58:24] between me and
[1:58:26] God so that we would know God and all
[1:58:28] his Holiness and his righteousness his
[1:58:30] Deliverance his forgiveness his love his
[1:58:33] faithfulness and in his
[1:58:35] purpose why did
[1:58:38] he and with this why did he stop brother
[1:58:41] Brenham so many
[1:58:43] times from doing something that would
[1:58:45] harm him or
[1:58:46] hurt and why did he allow him so many
[1:58:49] times to do something that would hurt or
[1:58:51] be wrong
[1:58:53] it's a million-dollar
[1:58:55] question we look at brother Ram's life
[1:58:57] and we say it was all
[1:58:59] perfect that what you say it was perfect
[1:59:01] it all worked out perfect in the end it
[1:59:04] was all perfect everything God did
[1:59:06] worked out perfect look at the ministry
[1:59:07] look at look at how he moved from the
[1:59:09] first to second third pole look at how
[1:59:11] the ministry got greater and how he
[1:59:13] learned so many things about God and he
[1:59:14] didn't fall into the same traps and you
[1:59:16] look this happened and this happened and
[1:59:18] that happened and now look at him at the
[1:59:19] end of the ministry and the opening of
[1:59:21] the word and it was is
[1:59:23] perfect but the only reason we say that
[1:59:25] is because we didn't live through
[1:59:27] it amen we didn't have those flashback
[1:59:31] moments in our mind when we remembered
[1:59:33] what we did we didn't have the times of
[1:59:35] weeping when we look through a photo
[1:59:40] album for us we look from the vantage
[1:59:43] point of watching a whole man's life and
[1:59:45] knowing who he was in the scriptures and
[1:59:47] how God dealt with him all the way and
[1:59:48] we look from this vantage point back and
[1:59:50] say it's perfect it worked to God
[1:59:52] purpose God had he had to learn those
[1:59:53] things he had to have training we do the
[1:59:55] same thing with the Apostle Paul we do
[1:59:57] the same thing with Peter we do the same
[1:59:58] thing with Moses and we look back and
[2:00:00] say they blew it but look it's perfect
[2:00:02] they had to learn something they had to
[2:00:03] be broken they had to have humility they
[2:00:06] had to have a greater understanding of
[2:00:07] what this was and we say it's
[2:00:10] perfect and then we come to our life and
[2:00:12] say it's nothing but a big mess and God
[2:00:14] can never use
[2:00:18] me maybe our lives are just like the
[2:00:21] rest of them maybe it's just the same
[2:00:23] for us maybe there's things that God has
[2:00:26] stopped us from and and not permitted
[2:00:28] and changed our ideas and and absolutely
[2:00:31] arrested the situation and changed it
[2:00:33] because it would have defeated his
[2:00:34] purpose but maybe there's times that we
[2:00:36] failed and we failed big because it also
[2:00:38] will work together for his purpose and
[2:00:40] do something that will benefit his
[2:00:43] purpose and benefit us long
[2:00:46] term so at the end of all of
[2:00:49] this I want to say
[2:00:52] our failures will never be stronger than
[2:00:54] his
[2:00:57] purpose when he chose Jacob over Esau it
[2:01:01] wasn't because of their Merit their
[2:01:04] conduct their
[2:01:06] personality he chose them before they
[2:01:09] manifest any of those
[2:01:10] things and when they began to manifest
[2:01:13] their characteristics you and I would
[2:01:15] have picked the one over the other to be
[2:01:17] the child of God the one to carry forth
[2:01:19] the promise we wouldn't have picked
[2:01:20] Jacob we would have picked Esau
[2:01:23] and it wasn't based on Merit and conduct
[2:01:25] and doing right or doing wrong because
[2:01:26] Joseph did wrong and did wrong and did
[2:01:28] wrong and did wrong and did wrong but it
[2:01:30] was God's
[2:01:31] choice and every wrong somehow worked
[2:01:33] together for right according to God's
[2:01:35] purpose sir what about my life and your
[2:01:39] life I say if we're children of God it's
[2:01:41] the same
[2:01:43] thing and so what I want more than
[2:01:46] anything for me and for
[2:01:49] you is I want the devil to lose the the
[2:01:52] Mind
[2:01:53] battle I want Satan to lose the Mind
[2:01:57] Battle of why didn't God stopped me or
[2:02:00] why didn't I just make another choice or
[2:02:03] why or every time I fail I'll never
[2:02:07] amount I can never be I I may not be I
[2:02:09] must not be I probably I want the devil
[2:02:12] to lose the Mind battle today friends
[2:02:15] and I want God's promised word to
[2:02:17] Prevail I want us to take the sword of
[2:02:20] the word and drive back every lie of the
[2:02:22] enemy amen everything that's tried to
[2:02:24] hinder us or hold us back or keep us
[2:02:25] from moving forward brother bam had a
[2:02:27] whole slew of mistakes amen he messed up
[2:02:29] the first and second pool but that never
[2:02:31] stopped God from using him for the third
[2:02:33] pool yeah amen amen you and I messed up
[2:02:38] this
[2:02:41] message but that never stopped us from
[2:02:43] from using us to Manifest this message
[2:02:46] we've mishandled things we've said
[2:02:48] things wrong we may have taught it the
[2:02:49] wrong way we may have displayed it the
[2:02:51] wrong way we may have messed it all up
[2:02:53] with our own humanity and our own mind
[2:02:55] and we say I've messed this up so bad
[2:02:56] God will never use me again tell me
[2:02:59] where that is in the
[2:03:01] scripture who else is going to manifest
[2:03:04] the
[2:03:05] word
[2:03:06] amen God has a purpose
[2:03:09] friends and I'm thankful that I believe
[2:03:11] he has a purpose for me and I believe he
[2:03:13] has a purpose for you and nothing in our
[2:03:17] lives will stop God's
[2:03:19] purpose so what do we do with the bad
[2:03:22] things we're just going to have to do
[2:03:24] what everybody else did with the bad
[2:03:25] things we're going to have to do what
[2:03:27] Abraham did we're going have to do what
[2:03:29] Moses did we're going to have to do what
[2:03:30] Peter did we're going to have to do what
[2:03:32] Paul did we're going to have to do what
[2:03:33] all of them did deal with our regrets be
[2:03:36] sorry for what we did and move forward
[2:03:38] in the program of God what am I going to
[2:03:41] do with all my I got to do the same
[2:03:42] thing brother bam did with all his
[2:03:44] regrets and all of his hurt and all the
[2:03:45] consequence I got to do the same thing
[2:03:47] they all did yeah I got to move forward
[2:03:50] in the program of God and let God use me
[2:03:52] for his great purpose I want to look at
[2:03:55] one scripture as the musicians come
[2:03:57] let's turn together to Psalms
[2:03:59] 37 and we can stand to read this let's
[2:04:02] stand and read Psalms

[2:04:28] of a good man are ordered by the Lord
[2:04:31] and he delighteth in his way though he
[2:04:34] fall wait a second
[2:04:38] stop
[2:04:40] stop didn't it just say the steps of a
[2:04:43] good man are ordered of the Lord if God
[2:04:45] ordered his steps and what's he doing
[2:04:49] falling why did he fall
[2:04:52] if God ordered his
[2:04:55] steps steps of a good man are ordered by
[2:04:57] the Lord and he delighteth in his way
[2:04:59] though he fall he shall not utterly be
[2:05:02] cast down for the Lord upholdeth him
[2:05:05] with his hand

[2:06:08] his hand I know he has there was times I
[2:06:12] felt like I was on the floor and under
[2:06:14] the floor and under the ground but I
[2:06:17] looked back and realized if it wasn't
[2:06:19] for him upholding me I would have been
[2:06:21] gone
[2:06:22] lost destroyed there must have been a
[2:06:24] hand holding me in my fall there must
[2:06:27] have been only so low that I can go
