[8:13] [music] when everything [singing] is
[8:16] right?
[8:19] One little word or simple
[8:21] [music and singing] misstep. It all
[8:23] crashes
[8:24] out of sight.
[8:29] You miss [music and singing] the second
[8:31] set of footprints.
[8:34] When everything [singing]
[8:36] is said,
[8:38] God, why [singing] can't you stay with
[8:41] me [music] each time it gets bad?
[8:45] [singing]
[8:47] [music] He says, "My child, I am with
[8:51] you, [singing and music] though your

[8:56] that I could never leave [singing] you.
[9:00] Why do you doubt [music] me?

[9:06] [music and singing]
[9:07] price. Can't you see
[9:13] when [singing] your life was rough,
[9:15] you've [music] had enough
[9:18] and you fell on [singing] your knees.
[9:24] I carry you.

[9:59] There's been tests I have [singing]
[10:01] faced.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; [music]
[10:03] &gt;&gt; I've had my share of victories.
[10:07] [singing] All by your grace. [music]
[10:11] I've been [singing] wounded. I've been
[10:13] beaten down.
[10:16] I keep [music] trying [singing]
[10:17] to press on.
[10:20] It's like I keep losing
[10:22] [singing and music] ground. There's no
[10:24] progress
[10:26] inside.
[10:29] He says, "My [singing]
[10:30] bride, I am with you. Though your eyes
[10:36] may not [singing] see,
[10:38] I could never leave you. [singing]
[10:42] Why do you doubt me?

[12:09] and I am yours.
[12:14] [music] But why me, [singing]
[12:17] Lord?
[12:18] [music]
[12:20] He says, [singing] "My wife, I am with

[24:11] say too, I enjoyed the specials. Thank

[24:28] Amen. And so, it's so exciting. So, we
[24:31] just want to go ahead and give the time
[24:32] to brother Isaiah. We're going to turn
[24:34] the service over to him so he can take
[24:36] his liberty. We want him [music] to
[24:37] relax. We want him to just share what
[24:39] the Lord has delivered to him and placed
[24:41] on his heart for us this morning.
[24:42] [music] And I don't know about you, but
[24:44] I've come to get my portion.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; I've come to receive from the Lord his

[26:45] this morning. We're so glad to be here
[26:48] by the grace of God. We appreciate the
[26:51] invitation uh given to us by our pastor
[26:55] and brother Chad Lamb. Amen. We've had
[26:58] such a wonderful uh experience uh since
[27:02] being here here, excuse me. Uh we had
[27:05] dinner or supper, whichever you want to
[27:07] call it, at his house.
[27:10] It was a great time. The food was
[27:12] delicious and the hospitality was great.
[27:16] And we just thank God for that
[27:18] &gt;&gt; because you know people don't have to do
[27:20] for you.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; They don't have to be kind to you.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; They don't have to be nice.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; But when people do that is their
[27:27] choosing.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; And so you should always appreciate
[27:32] &gt;&gt; the least of things
[27:34] &gt;&gt; when someone willfully do something for
[27:37] you.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; So I just want you to know that we
[27:40] appreciate your pastor and we appreciate
[27:42] being here by the grace of God.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's have a word of prayer and
[27:46] then I have you be seated. I'm going to
[27:48] sing just a song or so. Gracious
[27:50] heavenly father God, we thank you for
[27:52] your grace and your mercy. We thank you
[27:54] for being so good to us. Lord, you have
[27:56] been better to us than we've been to
[27:58] ourselves. Father, there is no words to
[28:01] express our gratitude. Words in the
[28:03] English language cannot express what we
[28:06] feel inside because what we are feeling
[28:09] Lord comes from a divine revelation. And
[28:12] there are no words in the earthly
[28:14] language that can express what I'm
[28:15] feeling. Father, we pray here that you
[28:19] bless the service. Lord, this is about
[28:21] you and not me. We come, oh God, to hear
[28:24] from you, Lord. And Lord, as we humble
[28:26] ourselves before you because even as
[28:29] your prophet said, Lord, we're just a
[28:31] stinking stable that you have chosen to
[28:34] be born in.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; And Lord, as humble as we know how, we
[28:38] bow before you. and we say please uh
[28:42] have thine own way
[28:43] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[28:50] Down from
[28:52] his glory,
[28:58] everliving
[29:00] story. [singing]

[34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us stand.
[34:44] One thing I just want to say that uh
[34:49] the Lord has been so good to me.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:52] And if anybody can praise him, I can.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; This message is the greatest thing that
[35:00] ever struck the earth.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; And God knows we should never handle it
[35:06] lightly.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; He's doing something.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; And I am so grateful. Amen. This morning
[35:15] to be a part
[35:17] of this great event.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We are the generation
[35:24] &gt;&gt; that God has chosen to defeat Satan,
[35:29] &gt;&gt; not by might,
[35:31] &gt;&gt; not by power,
[35:33] &gt;&gt; but by my spirit, sayeth the Lord.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; I'm so happy uh this morning
[35:40] uh because I see
[35:42] the message
[35:44] changing me. Amen.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; There for so many years I I tried to
[35:51] change me
[35:55] &gt;&gt; but once you understand the true
[35:58] revelation of grace
[36:02] &gt;&gt; it gives you a deeper love
[36:05] &gt;&gt; for your savior
[36:07] &gt;&gt; as we stand
[36:09] let us turn to Isaiah 14
[36:13] chapter 14 we're going to start reading
[36:15] at the 13th verse. [snorts]
[36:28] Thank you, musicians.
[36:40] For thou
[36:42] for thou hast said in thine heart,
[36:44] starting at the 13th verse, I will
[36:46] ascend into heaven. I will exalt my
[36:49] throne above the stars of God.
[36:53] I will sit also upon the mount of the
[36:55] congregation
[36:57] in the sides of the north.
[37:00] I will ascend above the heights of the
[37:02] clouds.
[37:03] I will be like the most high.
[37:07] Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell
[37:11] to the size of the pit. And they that
[37:14] see thee shall narrowly look upon thee,
[37:17] and consider thee, saying, Is this the
[37:21] man
[37:22] &gt;&gt; that made the earth to tremble, that did
[37:26] shake kingdoms?
[37:29] Revelations 3
[37:38] 2122.
[37:44] [snorts] To him that overcomemeth will I
[37:46] grant to sit with me in my throne,
[37:50] even as I also overcame
[37:53] and sat down with my father in his
[37:56] throne.
[37:58] He that have an ear, let him hear what
[38:02] the spirit saith unto the churches.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Our gracious heavenly
[38:09] father God, we come before you, Lord, as
[38:11] humbly as we know how. We thank you for
[38:13] being so good to us,
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Lord. We just come to share to give to
[38:20] the church what you have given us. And
[38:22] Lord, I pray this morning that somewhere
[38:25] somehow someone will know that you are
[38:30] in in this [snorts] place. Break the
[38:32] yoke, destroy the works of the enemy.
[38:35] And if there be anyone that needs
[38:37] salvation, I pray, Father God, that you
[38:39] would open their hearts, their minds,
[38:42] their souls to receive you. Because,
[38:45] Father, this is your work. We're just
[38:48] here, Lord, being used by you.
[38:51] We count it a privilege and an honor.
[38:54] And so therefore, Lord, we ask you that
[38:56] you give us grace to move completely out
[38:58] of way, out of your way, that you would
[39:00] have preeminence in this service. And
[39:02] we'll be careful to give you the praise.
[39:04] In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Well, we know by the grace of God the
[39:18] story. [snorts]
[39:21] My subject would be
[39:24] the strength of the throne.
[39:28] We understand by the grace of God how it
[39:30] all started.
[39:32] God creating everything
[39:36] because of what he had in his mind.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; We also know that the first Adam fell,
[39:45] &gt;&gt; he lost our inheritance.
[39:49] But God wasn't through with mankind.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Now, some of us may not like this.
[39:54] Excuse me.
[39:56] [clears throat] Some of us may not like
[39:58] this journey that we're going through
[40:00] &gt;&gt; right now. But I am so happy
[40:05] &gt;&gt; because I understand the journey.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; We understand by God's grace that
[40:12] without this,
[40:14] &gt;&gt; how would you ever love God? Right.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; Adam didn't really know how much he
[40:21] loved Eve
[40:23] &gt;&gt; until she fell.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; See, you don't understand. Love is
[40:27] always tried.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; And God tried Adam. We know how it all
[40:34] went down. The Lord blessed and Adam
[40:37] became the very sacrifice, if you want
[40:39] to say it like that,
[40:40] &gt;&gt; for Eve. because had he not
[40:43] &gt;&gt; joined with her, we wouldn't be here
[40:45] today.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; But in all of that, it looked like
[40:50] throughout all the ages, Satan was
[40:53] getting the best.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Especially in this last seventh age or
[40:58] in the age of, you know, the Pentecostal
[41:01] age or the Leoian age.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; It just looked like Satan was having
[41:07] havoc over the people.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; The deception was so great
[41:13] &gt;&gt; until God had to send us a prophet.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; And had not God sent us in Malachi 4, we
[41:21] would be the same.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; I I'm so thankful
[41:28] for the resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[41:30] Christ.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Because we know that when he died, he
[41:36] conquered death, hell, and the grave.
[41:39] Amen.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't complete.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; That same high priest had to come again.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; And we know that in 1963 he came.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; The book was open.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; The seals were loose.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; He came in his presence.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; And he's still here.
[42:06] Amen.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; When Adam before falling, he ruled
[42:15] &gt;&gt; the world or Eden.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; According to the prophet of God, we know
[42:20] that whatever Adam would say,
[42:24] &gt;&gt; that word would not come back void.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; If he would say to the mountain, we move
[42:29] or tree be plucked up and move. All
[42:32] nature, all animals obeyed him.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Why? Because in reality, he had the
[42:41] title deed.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Right.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; That is the power of the word being
[42:48] open.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; When God said, "Eat the book."
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Right?
[42:53] &gt;&gt; That's what he means.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Now, we understand none of us are eating
[42:57] a book.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:59] But he's basically telling us to ingest
[43:02] it.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Not only do we ingest the word, we
[43:07] digest the word.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Cuz once we digest the word, we become
[43:12] the word.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; So we understand Sat Satan doesn't
[43:17] understand that. He he think he knows.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; His wisdom is of this world.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; His wisdom is science.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; He doesn't even understand faith. Amen.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Right.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; We who are of this generation,
[43:34] &gt;&gt; we are what we call a faith generation.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; And the just shall live by his faith.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Not ours. His faith.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; And this is why it's so important
[43:48] &gt;&gt; to be able to understand the message
[43:51] &gt;&gt; in the sense that you just don't become
[43:54] a believer because you say, "I believe."
[43:56] Amen.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Satan believes and tremble.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; But we know by the grace of God that if
[44:03] you truly believe, you will act upon the
[44:06] word.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; That has been given to you.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; We know that justification bring forth
[44:14] sanctification.
[44:16] Sanctification bring forth the baptism
[44:18] of the Holy Ghost.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; And that Holy Ghost make room for the
[44:22] person of Jesus Christ.
[44:24] Can I say this? By the grace of God,
[44:28] &gt;&gt; when God opened uh the word,
[44:32] &gt;&gt; it truly exposed Satan.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; To a place that he was just totally
[44:38] naked.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; When we're not stumbling over his
[44:42] tactics,
[44:44] &gt;&gt; we understand him.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; We understand the battle.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; But we also understand the victory.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Coming from the breach between the seven
[44:59] church ages, paragraph 100, the word of
[45:03] God says he's lost all so his
[45:07] inheritance. speaking of Adam
[45:11] when he lost his fellowship
[45:13] and right to his life. Remember the day
[45:17] you eat thereof that day you'll die.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; And when he lost his life he also lost
[45:24] his inheritance in life because he had
[45:27] completely
[45:29] supreme
[45:31] control of the earth. I stress that
[45:36] &gt;&gt; he had completely
[45:38] or complete
[45:40] control of the earth.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; And brother Vanom said, "Amen." That
[45:46] when the seals were open, it placed us
[45:50] back.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Before the fall.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Now, understand what I'm saying because
[45:57] I'm not speaking religion today. Amen.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; We have a lot of religion around this
[46:02] message.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about religion. I'm
[46:05] talking about life.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; This message, as I said earlier, come to
[46:12] change you.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; From glory to glory.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Your level of worship
[46:20] &gt;&gt; will increase.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; With your revelation of the word.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Is that the truth?
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And as it increase,
[46:29] &gt;&gt; it changes you. It changes everything
[46:32] about you or or the part of you you
[46:35] thought you knew.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Right?
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Because you have a change that's going
[46:40] on in you.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; How could I say it? You've never walked
[46:44] this way before.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We constantly call oursel,
[46:50] "Oh, ye are gods." We don't even know
[46:52] what that is.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah. But as we
[46:57] progress,
[46:59] &gt;&gt; as we move forward,
[47:01] all nature, nature must respect us.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[47:09] &gt;&gt; It's not something that you got to say,
[47:11] hey, when you got to respect me.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; No.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; It honors you.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Whether you understand it or not, I
[47:19] don't even understand the intelligence
[47:21] of w intelligence of wind.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. But the wind must re
[47:26] obey you.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; You say, "Okay, what what do you say?"
[47:30] If the if the real Adam, the first Adam
[47:33] would say to the wind, "Stop."
[47:36] &gt;&gt; I don't know how the wind hears.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; But the wind has to obey.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; I'm [clears throat] not talking about
[47:45] something I haven't experienced. Many of
[47:48] have of of us have seen how we've prayed
[47:51] and God turned the storm around.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That wasn't um us figuring
[47:58] it out. I I don't know how it works.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; But I know that one thing God has given
[48:03] the bride of Jesus Christ. That is the
[48:05] spoken word.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Now, we realize the spoken word is not
[48:10] given to children.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; You must come to a maturity.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. In order for God to trust you with
[48:17] the spoken word, you can't just feel
[48:19] like I want to speak.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Everything is moving by the power of
[48:26] God.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Everything is moving.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; And so realize by the grace of God that
[48:32] even though you can't see him,
[48:34] &gt;&gt; you may not even be able to feel him,
[48:37] but he's there.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And once you receive the Holy
[48:40] Ghost,
[48:41] &gt;&gt; this is what I tell my people or tell
[48:43] the people in Iowa. Shame on you when
[48:46] you feel like you lonely.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Cuz God said,
[48:53] &gt;&gt; "I'll never leave you."
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Nor will I forsake you.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; So if you feeling lonely, it's because
[49:00] you have accepted some negative thoughts
[49:04] &gt;&gt; and those thoughts are not of God. Amen.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible said in the presence
[49:11] [screaming] of the Lord,
[49:13] &gt;&gt; there's fullness of joy.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; So when I see people that are not full
[49:18] of joy,
[49:21] &gt;&gt; they're lacking.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Somewhere in their lives, they're not
[49:25] consecrated like they should be. Oh,
[49:27] come on, somebody.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; It's real.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; It's real.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; And then you see some Christians, they
[49:33] just happy all the time. Guarantee you
[49:36] they got they have a prayer life,
[49:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[49:40] &gt;&gt; They read their word.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not that they're not
[49:44] battled,
[49:45] &gt;&gt; but they know how to cast down
[49:48] &gt;&gt; evil imaginations
[49:50] &gt;&gt; because they realize Amen. As Christ's
[49:53] word comes to give us life,
[49:55] &gt;&gt; the devil's word comes to give bring
[49:57] death.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Now, let me keep let me go on. I'm
[50:02] sorry. I'm getting a little stirred.
[50:06] When we see by God's grace that Adam had
[50:10] completely control of the earth,
[50:13] &gt;&gt; he was good. He was God of the earth.
[50:16] God is the God of the universe
[50:19] everywhere. But his son had this earth
[50:22] under his own control. He could speak.
[50:27] He could name. He could say, he could
[50:30] stop nature. He could do anything he
[50:33] wanted to. See, but when he did that, he
[50:37] lost his inheritance.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Now, I I want to say this, it's just
[50:41] amazing to me because the more spiritual
[50:44] you become, the more you begin to
[50:47] connect with the mind of God.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; This is why it's so important
[50:55] to think on
[50:57] &gt;&gt; God.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't have my Bible with me, but
[51:01] you know that that is the word of God.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[51:05] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word, the word
[51:06] was with God, and the word was God. God
[51:08] is God is God is his word.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; So, when we begin to think on the words
[51:14] of God,
[51:16] what word are we thinking on? Amen.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; If you were with him before the
[51:20] beginning,
[51:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[51:22] &gt;&gt; If you were with him when he said, "Let
[51:25] there be."
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; The very [screaming] words in the book,
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; are your words.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; God,
[51:35] &gt;&gt; the Bible is not separated from the the
[51:37] the the people of God.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? I'm I'm not talking
[51:43] about your flesh.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm talking about that soul that
[51:46] has the Holy Ghost.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is one with the word.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; But God wants our minds,
[51:54] &gt;&gt; hear what I'm saying. The greatest
[51:56] battle that is fought
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; is truly in your mind.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Why? Why in your mind today? Because we
[52:05] realize by the grace of God, your mind,
[52:07] whatever you receive in your mind leaves
[52:10] your mind and it goes down and it
[52:13] creates something.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Whatever it creates is what you become.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Now, God is looking for a wife.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whose mind will be stayed on him.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Right.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So she can't afford
[52:32] &gt;&gt; to allow her [screaming] mind to be
[52:34] distracted.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; With something other than her husband.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; See, that's what Eve did.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; She let her mind be extracted.
[52:44] Distracted
[52:45] &gt;&gt; from Adam.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; By way of reasoning.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; And the devil taught her some science.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Hello. Which is what we are battling
[52:55] right now.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We battle science versus God.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Now, I I'm telling you something here
[53:05] this morning.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; You know, I I I said, Lord, I I really
[53:08] appreciate, you know, uh, Brother Tra
[53:10] Chad inviting us, and I'm What is that
[53:13] these people don't know,
[53:16] [laughter]
[53:17] but I thank God because of the teachings
[53:19] and all that you have.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; But I want to reiterate,
[53:24] &gt;&gt; I want to remind you,
[53:27] of who you are.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Right? Because we know that once we come
[53:31] to understand who we are,
[53:33] &gt;&gt; we become an invincible army.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; See, I have a goal.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; And my goal is to be completely
[53:43] surrendered.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; To his will.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; So much so that I look so much like him,
[53:51] &gt;&gt; I would be able to pull him out of
[53:52] heaven.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:56] You hear what I'm saying?
[53:58] &gt;&gt; See, if we all adapt that type of
[54:01] attitude,
[54:02] &gt;&gt; you put us together.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is this church is not defeated.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; You ask me, I'm saying we just begun.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Satan is mad.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; He see you changing
[54:21] &gt;&gt; and he can't stop you.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's trying to hold you up.
[54:27] Can I say it?
[54:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; He's trying to hold you up with social
[54:31] media.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh my god." Tick tock, tick
[54:38] tock. The time is running out.
[54:40] [laughter]
[54:42] &gt;&gt; And while you're up there looking at
[54:44] stuff, listen, y'all know I'm telling
[54:46] you the truth.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; You You tap on one thing.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. And the next uh uh uh thing you
[54:53] know, a whole hour has passed.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; And you haven't received anything from
[54:59] God.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; And you get away from that kind of a
[55:04] thing. [screaming]
[55:05] All you have is depression,
[55:07] &gt;&gt; oppression,
[55:09] &gt;&gt; all [screaming] of the things that Satan
[55:11] can give you as a gift.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But if [screaming] you turn
[55:16] your mind toward Jesus,
[55:18] &gt;&gt; turn your mind toward the word and think
[55:22] on these things.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[55:26] &gt;&gt; y'all hear what I'm saying?
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Because we understand that when brother
[55:29] Brandham
[55:30] &gt;&gt; was here, he told us to watch and look
[55:33] at the rock. Look at that unwritten
[55:35] word.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; You got to meditate on it.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Because can I say it like this? Even the
[55:44] message in book form
[55:46] &gt;&gt; has to come to you as a revelation.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You can read it, but you can't
[55:52] understand it.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Until the Holy Spirit brings the
[55:56] revelation to you of what it is.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm so happy about that.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[56:02] &gt;&gt; because it's Jesus Christ who gives us a
[56:05] revelation.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; You don't get it on your own.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; You can't learn this.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. This come by revelation.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; And you and I ought to be so grateful
[56:18] &gt;&gt; that God chooses you
[56:24] &gt;&gt; to be a vessel.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; And you know what?
[56:28] The devil is mad with me
[56:32] &gt;&gt; cuz when I was his,
[56:34] &gt;&gt; I did everything he wanted me to do,
[56:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:37] &gt;&gt; And probably and some, as they say.
[56:40] But when God saved me,
[56:44] &gt;&gt; nobody.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; You hear? Nobody. Since I've been saved,
[56:51] I've never had a desire to turn back.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Even when I didn't understand,
[57:00] &gt;&gt; there was never anything in me
[57:02] &gt;&gt; that wanted to turn back.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; And I'm [screaming] not talking down to
[57:07] those who turn back.
[57:10] That's your position.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; God had to do that for you.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Because the joy [screaming] of returning
[57:18] &gt;&gt; is greater than the joy you thought you
[57:20] had when you left.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; So God [screaming] knows what he's
[57:25] doing.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm no better than you and
[57:29] you know better than I am.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, didn't he have too many amens on
[57:33] that one?
[57:34] &gt;&gt; But it is the truth.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can I say it like this? The
[57:39] only super race
[57:42] &gt;&gt; is God's race.
[57:45] [applause]
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Those of us who have his DNA,
[57:49] &gt;&gt; that's what makes us a special class of
[57:51] people.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Satan purpose from Eden was
[57:57] to make his own self and Eden
[58:00] &gt;&gt; and exalt himself above so the stars of
[58:04] God would worship him. That's right.
[58:05] Yeah.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Sons would worship him.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; And he was absolutely carried it out
[58:11] now. And he has absolutely carried it
[58:15] out now.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Y.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Y'all know that.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; And And I'm [clears throat] going to say
[58:21] this because I've learned that you have
[58:24] to be careful
[58:27] &gt;&gt; in everything you do
[58:29] &gt;&gt; cuz Satan can slip in.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; And if you're not watchful,
[58:34] &gt;&gt; you'll find yourself worshiping him
[58:37] &gt;&gt; than worshiping God.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, y'all quiet on that.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; But it's nothing but the truth.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; I love music.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; I love to worship.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; But I've been in places.
[58:50] I'm not talking about denominations.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about message churches and
[58:54] message people. And when it flips, they
[58:57] don't even know the difference.
[59:00] It starts out worshiping God
[59:03] &gt;&gt; and then it flips.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[59:07] &gt;&gt; and they don't know it.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; But God has [screaming] designed me
[59:15] differently.
[59:17] [laughter]
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my God. I know the difference
[59:22] &gt;&gt; because [screaming] of who I am
[59:25] &gt;&gt; and whose I am.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:29] Can I say it like this? I even told my
[59:31] church, if God don't let Elvis get away
[59:34] with it,
[59:36] &gt;&gt; he ain't going to let you get away with
[59:38] it.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; You can't be worshiping God, moving like
[59:44] Elvis.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Hello. I don't care if they saying
[59:50] Jesus.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; That's another Jesus.
[59:59] Amen.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Brooks,
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; hush your mouth.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; But I know what I'm talking about.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I've [screaming] left I've
[1:00:13] left Oh, man. I've left places, you
[1:00:15] know, go my go I go to my uh uh hotel
[1:00:19] room just absolutely cry
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; because I said, "Lord, they don't see
[1:00:23] it." That's right.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; And I know I look like I'm an oddball
[1:00:27] right now, but wherever I go, where
[1:00:29] whatever I do, y'all know I sing, but I
[1:00:31] go to worship.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Only one God, and that's the Lord Jesus
[1:00:35] Christ.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; And I have to become somebody's enemy,
[1:00:40] then so be it.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is this all right?
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; And he has absolutely carried it out
[1:00:48] now. And when he's done this and brought
[1:00:51] it into the church, what do you mean?
[1:00:54] Whenever and I don't mean to talk about
[1:00:56] music, but here I am. Whenever music is
[1:01:01] above the [screaming] words of the
[1:01:02] music,
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; it's no longer God. Yes, sir.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Music comes to compliment,
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; not to take over.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Amen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Let me get off this because I have a lot
[1:01:21] of people texting me after a while.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; But we know by the grace of God
[1:01:28] that our strength comes from truth.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible said that it is the
[1:01:38] truth
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; that will make you free.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Not not set you free, make you free.
[1:01:47] Amen.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You love the Lord.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Now, let me move on.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; He said we're living in and it's Satan's
[1:01:56] that done it through educational
[1:01:58] programs. Better fit, better this,
[1:02:01] better that,
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; and not knowing all the time. They're
[1:02:05] walking right straight into death.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Blinded
[1:02:10] leading the blind. Blinded leaders of
[1:02:14] the nation. Blinded leaders of science,
[1:02:18] blind leaders of the church, blind
[1:02:21] leaders of the blinded. Jesus said, "Let
[1:02:24] them alone. They will both fall in the
[1:02:27] ditch."
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Now, that's that's that's powerful.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; But you got to understand, we come to do
[1:02:33] something. It's not going to get better.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, somebody. Oh, we're living
[1:02:41] in the land of the free. No, we're not.
[1:02:43] No.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Those days are over with.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whether you understand it or
[1:02:50] not, Christians, you are the enemy.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; But God has to do it this way.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because we're too laxed.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; God has to put some pressure on us
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; to bring us to the place where we should
[1:03:10] be.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It is the truth.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Now, he wanders. I got to hurry because
[1:03:18] I know I'm taking too much time.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; He said, now coming from the seven
[1:03:22] church ages exposition. He said,
[1:03:24] remember this, and you've heard this
[1:03:25] quote over and over again. Christ in the
[1:03:28] true church is a continuation of the
[1:03:30] book of Acts.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; But the book of Revelation
[1:03:34] shows how that the antichrist spirit
[1:03:36] would come into the church and defile
[1:03:38] it.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Making it lukewarm, formal, powerless.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; You know, we we didn't I didn't
[1:03:49] understand why people just don't seem to
[1:03:53] want to worship God.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:57] And I'm just maybe on the little
[1:03:58] fanatical side,
[1:04:01] you know, cuz I get I get on people, you
[1:04:03] know, when they just want to just raise
[1:04:05] one hand,
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; bring that witness up.
[1:04:14] [laughter]
[1:04:16] You know what I'm saying? I don't
[1:04:17] understand that. when God is being so
[1:04:20] good to you.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; He said the book of Revelation shows how
[1:04:28] that the antichrist would come into the
[1:04:30] church and defile it, making it
[1:04:31] lukewarm, formal, [screaming] powerless.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; It it exposes Satan. Can I say this? We
[1:04:39] are not supposed to become powerless
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; as we move toward this great
[1:04:47] translation. Yeah,
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; we supposed to become more and more and
[1:04:52] more like him.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; And this power I'm talking about is
[1:04:56] authority.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; When you know that you know that you
[1:05:00] know that you know that you got Jesus on
[1:05:02] the inside,
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; it drives [screaming] away all the fear.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:09] The bride, she's not trembling in
[1:05:11] [screaming] fear.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She's standing strong in
[1:05:15] confidence.
[1:05:17] Is that right?
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; This message gives you confidence.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:05:24] When you realize, Amen. that the grace
[1:05:27] of God got you covered.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I make mistakes, brother.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; But God [screaming] got me covered.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; When I fall [screaming] or come short,
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; you know who picks me up?
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Not my next old neighbor, but God
[1:05:44] himself.
[1:05:46] How many times you have been troubled
[1:05:50] and all of a sudden a hymn breaks in
[1:05:52] your mind?
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; You think that comes from the devil?
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; That comes from God.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; And and and I'm loving it. I'm loving
[1:06:01] every bit of this walk.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Every stumble, every fall, every
[1:06:06] failure, I look back and I see where he
[1:06:08] brought me from.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I can say this morning,
[1:06:12] he's brought me from a mighty long way.
[1:06:14] We've heard it.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; You know, I get excited.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; And I don't mind
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; cuz he likes it.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; But let me go on by the grace of God.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; But the book of Revelation shows the
[1:06:28] Antichrist spirit while he comes in
[1:06:30] church devou making it more formal and
[1:06:32] powerless. It exposes Satan. What are
[1:06:36] you saying?
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; You got all these message believers
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; and you say, "Give me a roar.
[1:06:44] Roar.
[1:06:50] Y'all know it's true.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Amen."
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; And And we we we don't take note that
[1:06:59] something's wrong in the house.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Am I right or wrong?
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; All I know is that when John,
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; saw his name,
[1:07:14] Hallelujah.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; When he saw his name, there was no no
[1:07:19] quiet moment.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; He began to scream. He began to shout.
[1:07:24] He began to praise God. [screaming]
[1:07:26] Hallelujah.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Something on the inside. See, that's
[1:07:31] what I'm talking about.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; When it comes to your worship,
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; your worship is built upon your
[1:07:37] revelation.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you got a real revelation
[1:07:43] of who you are, where you [screaming]
[1:07:45] came from, and where you're going,
[1:07:48] hallelujah, God has set you up for
[1:07:52] praise.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; God set you up for worship.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Because that's the throne
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; that Satan wanted.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; He wanted people to worship him.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; And that's the throne. It's not a chair.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; It's a position. Y'all hear what I'm
[1:08:11] saying?
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; And if God said if you overcome,
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; I let you sat in my throne
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; even as I've sat in my father's throne.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; What is he saying? I'm giving you the
[1:08:22] position.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The same position Adam had.
[1:08:28] Somebody help me here. There was not
[1:08:30] [screaming] an animal in the garden that
[1:08:33] Adam was afraid of.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Why? Because in their own way they
[1:08:38] worshiped him. Yes.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah, Lord.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; I I saw something just the other day
[1:08:47] before I came.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; I first got a little small car. Where
[1:08:52] was the SUV? But it was too small for me
[1:08:53] and my wife to it was too, you know,
[1:08:55] close, too,
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; you know, SUV, you want some room in it,
[1:08:59] right?
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; And I drove back and then I knew I found
[1:09:03] out my daughter and and and my grandson
[1:09:06] want to go so come. So I I took the car
[1:09:08] back and I had a brother say to me,
[1:09:11] "That man won't God going to give that
[1:09:12] man eternal life." I said, "What?" He
[1:09:15] said, "Not only that man going to be
[1:09:16] good to you, he ain't going to charge
[1:09:17] you nothing extra." Something like that.
[1:09:19] And he going to give you a what? What? A
[1:09:22] minivan.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; I had no plan. I I made the reservation
[1:09:28] to fa same day
[1:09:30] [snorts]
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; and the man did the same exactly. He did
[1:09:34] the exact thing
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; the brother said he was going to do.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; A car like this
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; versus a car like that.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Same amount.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Can I I'm just going to tell you how
[1:09:50] much it was.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; $200.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; For three days.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Long distance.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? [laughter]
[1:10:02] God did that.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; I told him, "Brother," I said, "See, he
[1:10:06] he believes in that kind of thing. You
[1:10:08] speak it, God will honor it."
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; When you led by the spirit,
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; you're not talking negative stuff.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything out of your mouth
[1:10:21] is positive.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Y'all remember I told you my testimony,
[1:10:26] I think, when I had that cancer.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And everybody says, "Well, I had
[1:10:30] somebody say, "But what if?" What if?
[1:10:34] That ain't in my vocabulary.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It ain't what if.
[1:10:40] [screaming]
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; God has already done it.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; That's how the bride speaks.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; We don't do whatifs.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; We are people of authority.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; We're sitting in the throne. Yes.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; You said, "Oh, when I get over yonder."
[1:10:58] Well, that ain't the way the prophet
[1:11:00] said it.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; If he said that the opening of the word
[1:11:03] has brought us back to the place where
[1:11:05] Adam before he fell,
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Adam was in [screaming] the throne.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; He was the king on earth. Oh, come on,
[1:11:12] somebody.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; And everything on earth had to obey him.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; My wife and I were coming down and they
[1:11:20] were talking about snowstorms. She and I
[1:11:22] prayed. Hallelujah. It's like God opened
[1:11:25] up the way.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; We didn't have no snowstorm. We had
[1:11:29] nothing.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Even coming through the Chicago where
[1:11:32] all the traffic is, God moved that out
[1:11:34] the way, too.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Y'all better hear what I'm saying. What
[1:11:38] I'm saying is we are we [screaming] live
[1:11:41] by our testimonies.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Everything God works with you, he
[1:11:46] working to bring a testimony.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; And like I tell people, you can't have a
[1:11:51] testimony if there's no test.
[1:11:55] Amen.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Now I'm I'm [clears throat]
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Let me move on.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to finish this quote.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; But we [snorts] understand by the grace
[1:12:07] of God.
[1:12:09] He fights that. He fights the word and
[1:12:13] you are the word.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; He fights you. You don't have Oh Lord,
[1:12:18] why? Why? Why? What you mean why?
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You've chosen the harder way.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; You think you're going to go sweeping
[1:12:26] through the city?
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; You come to be tried.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; You come to be tested.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; As as we say, you come to prove that
[1:12:38] you're not from Satan's Eden.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And in this proving, I I
[1:12:44] don't know. I'm so I can't even get it
[1:12:46] out like I really want to.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; But I have [screaming] a joy
[1:12:49] unspeakable.
[1:12:51] Now, do I get a little, you know, my
[1:12:53] flesh sometime? Absolutely. Yes, sir.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; But there's a place in me
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Satan can't touch.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me?
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; He may rattle the curtains a little bit,
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; but he can't shake up the house.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because on the inside of the
[1:13:14] inside, it's not just a God, it's the
[1:13:18] God. Hallelujah.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; The Almighty God, the God who made
[1:13:23] heaven and earth, the God who
[1:13:24] [screaming] made everything, the God who
[1:13:26] made you.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; You think he he's Yeah, he's in here.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; I I'm trusting he's in you, sir.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; But I know he's in here.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; And you you know what? God will always
[1:13:41] make things happen in your life
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; to bring you back to the revelation
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; that I never left you. Amen.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; I'm always with you.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; I promise I never leave you, nor will I
[1:13:52] forsake you.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; And it has nothing to do with my
[1:13:56] feelings.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Like I was telling somebody the other
[1:14:01] day, and I'm I'm I'm going to finish
[1:14:03] this quote. [laughter]
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; But my point is this.
[1:14:08] [snorts]
[1:14:10] None of us are worthy.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; If I came down and say, "Here, have
[1:14:17] $100,000." The first one that comes up
[1:14:20] to the front, you know what'll happen?
[1:14:22] It'll be a stampede,
[1:14:25] sir.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; I might even be one in the line.
[1:14:29] [laughter]
[1:14:32] But my point is,
[1:14:34] it's given to you.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember when somebody gave me
[1:14:39] my first 12. It was a 12 gauge bicycle
[1:14:42] from Europe
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; and I showed it off.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; I didn't say, "Oh, this bicycle was
[1:14:50] given to me. Ain't it pretty?" Uh-uh. I
[1:14:53] got on it.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; I rode it.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; And I was glad when people said, "Well,
[1:14:59] where did you get that bike from?"
[1:15:01] [laughter]
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; How did you get it? It was a gift.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; So, what I'm trying to say is God has
[1:15:07] given you eternal life
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; and you're just setting it up on the
[1:15:11] shelf.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is my eternal life. This is my
[1:15:16] little box. It's not that. It's not
[1:15:19] given to you for that reason.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God wants that light to
[1:15:25] shine.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; God don't care if you look like a fool.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Everybody usually ones who follow God,
[1:15:33] they that's what they look like. They
[1:15:34] look crazy.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God wants somebody who's not
[1:15:40] ashamed of him.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; The bride is [screaming] not ashamed.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, somebody.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, we done got too pretty.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of folks pretty.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; You come to church and you don't even
[1:15:59] want to mess up your hair.
[1:16:03] One time we didn't care.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Here's a time we didn't care.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Sisters, you say that's Pentecostal,
[1:16:12] aren't you?
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; See what I'm saying?
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; You've heard somebody say you're not
[1:16:17] Pentecostals. Yes, you are by birth.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; By birth, you are. If you ain't
[1:16:22] Pentecostal by birth, you better get it.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And all I can say is the
[1:16:29] Pentecostal, the real Pentecostals have
[1:16:31] a certain way they act.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Cuz brother B said, "No matter where I
[1:16:36] go, [screaming]
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; if if they're filled with the Holy
[1:16:39] Ghost, they act the same way."
[1:16:42] [cheering]
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; I was at a meeting years ago and they
[1:16:51] were setting people down cuz they got
[1:16:53] excited. I said, "Oh my God, please
[1:16:55] don't let them touch me
[1:16:58] cuz they going to think I got a demon.
[1:17:04] Ain't nobody going to stop me from
[1:17:06] worshiping God." Now,
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; this ain't about you and me. It's about
[1:17:10] me and him,
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; right? So, my my point is I you can't
[1:17:15] allow yourself to get cooled off. Hal I
[1:17:19] know I know I know it's a lot of a lot
[1:17:21] of this stuff is emotional and all but I
[1:17:24] don't know about you I like emotions
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; that's what he gave them to me for
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; to worship him
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; y'all understand me
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; and and I'm not saying you got to get
[1:17:36] fanatical that's not what I'm saying
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; but when you when you when the Holy
[1:17:41] Ghost is present
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; you feel it
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; you know it
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:17:47] Whether they shouting or screaming,
[1:17:49] they're you know it.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; But everybody ain't supposed to act to
[1:17:53] say.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; It's no cookie cutters.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; I don't know why I'm saying this,
[1:18:01] pastor, but I got to [laughter] say it.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; You know, because every this is the way
[1:18:05] the message believe and this is the way
[1:18:07] we act.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[1:18:16] I mean, I've seen Methodist church act
[1:18:17] like that. And Baptist and
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; y'all looking at me like I'm crazy. When
[1:18:23] the last time you been to a Methodist or
[1:18:24] Baptist,
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; I don't mean to make fun, but my point
[1:18:29] is
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; you're different.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Is that right, sir?
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon say you're the calf that
[1:18:35] got the the real nourishment.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; You're not you weren't built up on on
[1:18:40] vitamins like that.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; You got the real deal. Hallelujah.
[1:18:44] [screaming]
[1:18:45] You're the fatted
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; calf. [laughter]
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Now, your prophet said that.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; It was the one who [screaming] wasn't
[1:18:54] fed right that looked over there said
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; fanaticism.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Ah,
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; the strength of the throne. I haven't
[1:19:08] even got to the message yet. Let me
[1:19:10] help. Help me, Jesus. Help me, Jesus.
[1:19:12] Help me, Lord. [laughter]
[1:19:15] Listen. He goes on to say, "Amen. It
[1:19:18] won't take just an ordinary study
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; and thinking to make this book real."
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Well, I read a message book today. So,
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; What did it do for you?
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, I heard a tape this morning. Oh, so
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; what did it do for you?
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me tell you something.
[1:19:43] There was a time, Amen. I had a
[1:19:44] situation in my neck. God healed me.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; By listening,
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; you know why? Because when I listen to a
[1:19:54] tape or read a book, I read and listen
[1:19:57] by expectation.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm looking for something.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; I'm searching for something. I want him
[1:20:03] to speak to me personally.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. Yes. Yeah.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; You don't listen to learn it here.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; You listen for it to reveal something.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; I don't even know how God does it, but
[1:20:18] let me hold. Let me move on.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; We understand that brother Brandham
[1:20:22] didn't get this message just because he
[1:20:23] was a preacher.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; But he had to be consecrated.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; To the cause.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; You must be consecrated
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; to the cause. This is your strength.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; It's not just being able to quote him,
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; But the power is in [screaming] the
[1:20:45] life.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; And let me let me move on. And because
[1:20:53] I'm I'm looking at people even in my own
[1:20:55] church, I said, "Hey,
[1:20:58] you got to love one another."
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; You got to love one another. Yes.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; You got to forgive one another.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; That's the big one, right?
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; I I just can't afford to lose everything
[1:21:14] because I didn't forgive my brother or
[1:21:16] my sister.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; I don't know who this is, but you taking
[1:21:21] me all off my message.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; But the point is, I'm here. Amen. Cuz
[1:21:28] you know, you got forgiving. No, it's
[1:21:30] not easy.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; But it's possible. Amen.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; I have been wounded
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; many a times.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; And there were times, Amen. I I said,
[1:21:45] "Oh, I forgave him."
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Three years later, I'm still struggling.
[1:21:49] Yes, sir.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, y'all don't know what I'm talking
[1:21:51] about. Some of y'all sir,
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; still struggling.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; But I don't like that funny feeling.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; I don't like it when people got me in
[1:22:00] prison
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; and they enjoying their freedom.
[1:22:04] Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; So I kept crying out to the Lord, "Help
[1:22:08] me, Lord."
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; And he did.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; And right now, I would do anything for
[1:22:14] that brother.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Big, [screaming] small, it doesn't
[1:22:17] matter. I won't even think about it
[1:22:19] because you know what? Love don't think.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Love acts.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts]
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Now, let me move on by the grace of God.
[1:22:32] I love the word.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; And and so you understand that this this
[1:22:37] this position that God is taking us
[1:22:39] through. Y'all believe it.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; It it's not going to be many.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; But I'm one of them.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; And And you got to realize, Amen. By the
[1:22:49] grace of God that it's already done.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; The victory is yours.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; It's already done. Yes.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; And all God is trying to tell you is to
[1:23:00] enjoy your salvation. [screaming]
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; I enjoy my salvation.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Now you you you we know that by God's
[1:23:10] grace when God when when the when the
[1:23:12] lamb came took the book. Amen. That was
[1:23:15] that great victory.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; And this is what I love cuz no man was
[1:23:20] worthy.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Now that's a powerful revelation. Amen.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; If you came out of apostolic like I did
[1:23:27] where everything was so strict, you
[1:23:28] know, you had to wear long sleeves and
[1:23:30] skirts and the Y'all know what I'm Y'all
[1:23:33] know tied up here like
[1:23:37] couldn't wear a short sleeve shirt
[1:23:38] unless you're backsliding.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Y'all don't know.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Y'all think the message is strict.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; When I came to the message, I'm like,
[1:23:49] man, these people backsliding.
[1:23:51] [laughter]
[1:23:54] Wow.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; And you know, it's amazing. And I don't
[1:23:59] mean no harm, but No, let me say it.
[1:24:01] Yeah, I'm going to say it.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; It It's so [screaming] amazing how we're
[1:24:06] in the message and the skirts are
[1:24:09] getting shorter.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; And I say, "Oh, what's this?
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; What's this?"
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Why you wearing [screaming] them
[1:24:18] shorter?
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; That's right. If you're not trying to
[1:24:21] show your legs,
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; well, I'm not trying to show my legs. I
[1:24:26] said, then why are you shaving them?
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; You're not only shaving them, but you
[1:24:32] greasing them up or lo, whatever you
[1:24:34] call it. But my point is,
[1:24:37] you know, you're being a hypocrite
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; all these years and nothing has changed.
[1:24:45] This word will never change
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; when it comes to holiness. Amen.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; And I I'm I'm impressed
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; by what I see here. So, keep it up.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Now, you know your brother you're your
[1:25:01] brother's keeper.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; So, that means that when you see
[1:25:04] somebody going wrong, you got to help
[1:25:05] him stay saved.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; At least get the appearance that they
[1:25:10] are.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; So, you understand by the gra is is that
[1:25:13] right?
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Well, if I say something to brother so
[1:25:16] and so, he going to say he going to get
[1:25:17] mad. Let him get mad
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; down the road. [screaming] He'll
[1:25:21] appreciate it. He will appreciate it if
[1:25:23] he's a seed of God.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; No, don't be afraid of No. Hey, the word
[1:25:31] of God say don't be afraid of their
[1:25:32] faces.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I know you're not Ezekiel, but he
[1:25:35] said don't be afraid.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid of the faces of these
[1:25:39] people.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your love will conquer all of
[1:25:43] that.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Yes sir.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let resting in his authority.
[1:25:50] [clears throat]
[1:25:51] This is what the message came to give
[1:25:53] us.

[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; There is not If you haven't found that
[1:26:01] rest, that means you haven't crossed
[1:26:02] over yet.

[1:26:09] Spirit? How many of y'all believe this
[1:26:10] message with all your heart?

[1:26:19] with all your heart without a seal.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; What you say, brother? I didn't speak in
[1:26:26] time. I didn't jump. I didn't. You don't
[1:26:28] have to do all of that.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Even though that's good.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you,
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; it's good when I can dance.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't happen all the time.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; And I don't base my salvation on how
[1:26:41] many times I dance. I got it.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; I have seen and I don't mean I'm not
[1:26:46] boasting, but let me I
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going the way the spirit is leading
[1:26:49] me.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; I have I have I have seen probably more
[1:26:52] miracles in this message than most of
[1:26:54] you have.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; But I'm not I'm no fool.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Because the children of Israel saw a lot
[1:27:03] of miracles,

[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; I've even had tell message people say,
[1:27:14] "Well, you ain't never seen the pillar
[1:27:16] of fire." I said, "Well, you weren't
[1:27:18] there."
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me what I didn't see.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; I know this doctrine say you don't see
[1:27:29] it, but I saw something
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; and it looked just like what I saw
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; or have seen. Y'all understand what I
[1:27:35] [laughter] said?
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Hey,

[1:27:41] But people will try to take that from
[1:27:43] you.

[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; You you you you see Christians that you
[1:28:07] know you you you going back forth all
[1:28:09] the time here and there. That means you
[1:28:12] haven't crossed over.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; There's some unbelief in you somewhere.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; And God want to take that unbelief out
[1:28:18] of you.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; You'll never understand this message if
[1:28:22] you don't see the grace of God.

[1:28:38] there will never be a bulletin board.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Listing all the dos and the don'ts.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; It's not there.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Because the character of Christ
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; is what rules heaven.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God, think about this.
[1:29:00] God [screaming]
[1:29:00] has invited you
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; to be partaker
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; of his divine nature.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Can I say it like this? There is no
[1:29:10] other [screaming] divine nature outside
[1:29:12] of God's nature.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; So if you take in the nature of God, you
[1:29:16] take in God. [cheering]
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; And that's why he call you [screaming]
[1:29:21] God's.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you say, "Oh my God, I I
[1:29:28] need some patience."
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; And you even afraid to ask for it,
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; cuz you know what? You know you're going
[1:29:36] to get some tribulation.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; What you give it to me,
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; whatever I'm lacking,
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; no matter what I go through. And this is
[1:29:48] what I tell my church. I say here in
[1:29:50] Revelation 3, he you invited
[1:29:55] Is that right?
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Gold [screaming]
[1:29:58] tried in the fire.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; You don't mind being gold. Thank God for
[1:30:02] the deity.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; But you don't want the fire.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, you going to get it.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Whether you ask for it or not, you
[1:30:11] getting it.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; And if you are truly the sons and
[1:30:15] daughters of God, you must go through
[1:30:18] the fire.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Cuz God got to get all that trash, all
[1:30:22] that. Come on, y'all. You know, you I I
[1:30:26] I say it like this. You thought you was
[1:30:28] already all right.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Until you come to this message.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; And when you come to this message, it
[1:30:36] begins to work.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Move all into dark places you didn't
[1:30:40] even know you had.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; It finds you [screaming] out.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; But the strength of this message is
[1:30:49] humility.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Humble [screaming] yourself.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. Because if you humble yourself, he
[1:30:54] will exalt you in due time.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. I I you know, we don't know how
[1:31:00] to be humble. Some of us, we just don't
[1:31:02] know how to be humble. [snorts]
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; But God knows how to make you.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you. I'm sorry, pastor. I'm
[1:31:11] just every I'm feel like I'm everywhere.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; But but you know, my my point is this.
[1:31:16] You know,
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; you have you are the most blessed people
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; on earth.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:23] You ever thought why Cain killed Abel?
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Because he had a revelation of the lamb.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; And the devil has been mad ever since.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; And he's tried to stop the revelation of
[1:31:39] the lamb.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Because he knew there were going to come
[1:31:43] a real lamb.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; That would literally, Amen. take away
[1:31:47] everything he did.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? Amen.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; He done worked and built the kingdom
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; and here come the blood of the real
[1:31:54] lamb.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; That will destroy [screaming]
[1:31:57] everything.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; He made
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; And so we realize by the grace of God as
[1:32:05] we come through the church ages,
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; they didn't know Jesus like we know him.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; And they could only worship him in a
[1:32:16] partiality, a partial way. You
[1:32:19] understand me? It was according to their
[1:32:21] revelation.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; And when we came to the day of
[1:32:25] Pentecost, we thought it had we had it
[1:32:27] all.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Anybody else was Pentecostals? Hey,
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; we thought we had it all.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; It was a disappr.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; And was better
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; and greater than what you had.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; And you realize, Amen, that you didn't
[1:32:51] have to fast so much.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; You know, y'all know what I'm saying?
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all don't know what fasting
[1:33:00] is. But back in the Pentecostal church,
[1:33:03] you was made to fast.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Certain days of the week in my church,
[1:33:08] you had to fast no matter how hungry you
[1:33:11] was.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; But the message came
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. and showed us it wasn't by
[1:33:17] works.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; It was by the grace of God.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; And then we come to come to see, amen,
[1:33:27] that this whole thing has been by grace.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Not because you did this or did that.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; It's because he elected elected you,
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; chose you.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even that was by grace.
[1:33:41] Yeah.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; And you come to see these things and you
[1:33:44] say, "Well, praise the Y'all know what
[1:33:46] I'm saying." It sets you free.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; I don't know whether you know what I'm
[1:33:50] talking about,
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; but it set you free
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; to know that if I make a mistake, the
[1:33:56] blood of Jesus got me covered.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; A real believer don't want to make a
[1:34:03] mistake.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Real believers don't want to hurt our
[1:34:07] brothers or our sisters.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now. It's the truth anyway.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; And what God has done for this age has
[1:34:18] revealed his character.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Right. Yes, sir.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; So, you can't make a mistake.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Am I like Jesus
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; or am I not?
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Here's his character.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; And here are you. Here is you.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me?
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; All right. You got to measure it up.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? is like here.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; That's how it works.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; You got to be just like him.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; And none of us can [screaming]
[1:34:51] accomplish it.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Not one of us can add a cubit to our
[1:34:56] statue.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; So, how [screaming] are we going to get
[1:34:58] there? Yes, sir.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; By the grace of God.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I believe the blood of
[1:35:04] Jesus Christ. I believe the word of God.
[1:35:07] He that begun the good working will will
[1:35:11] what? Complete it.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:35:14] And don't worry about making a rapture
[1:35:17] cuz I am the rapture.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When he filled me with his
[1:35:21] Holy Ghost.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He gave me the down payment.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what [screaming] I'm saying?
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; So, let me say it like this. Teach us
[1:35:30] how to pray. He said, "Let thy will be
[1:35:32] done
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; in earth as it is in heaven."
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It ain't quiet up there.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; They're not quiet [screaming] up there.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, see, y'all done got quiet now.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; But up there,
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; is that right?
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it like this. The
[1:35:50] earth here in this third dimension is
[1:35:52] the quietest place between heaven and
[1:35:54] hell.
[1:35:56] [laughter]
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he said, if you can't
[1:36:00] stand loud noises,
[1:36:02] right?
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; He said, if you get up there, you'll
[1:36:05] freeze to death.
[1:36:08] Yes.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Because people, the joy of the Lord is
[1:36:11] your strength.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; That's why the devil attacks your joy.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; If he can seize you or sees your joy, he
[1:36:21] know he's got you pinned down.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Ah, I I tell you, I tell you, it's
[1:36:27] amazing.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Listen. And he said before he reveals
[1:36:32] his characteristics of the last age to
[1:36:34] us, he gives us one final look at his
[1:36:38] gracious and supreme deity. Who do you
[1:36:42] think he talking about?
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; One last [screaming] look.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; It this is not going to repeat.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; This is it.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:57] You know, even your prophet of God got
[1:36:59] so excited he ran around a tree.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Scaring all the animals.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; I'm just saying.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Sometime it runs over.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; You know me, sometimes the pot do you
[1:37:13] know it does. It runs over.
[1:37:16] [snorts]
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You love the Lord.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; You see, and I hope I don't fear nobody
[1:37:21] by saying this. I love grits.
[1:37:26] And grits, you got to keep an eye on it.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; When you cook grits, you can't just say,
[1:37:31] "Okay, I'mma turn the eye on and then
[1:37:32] I'll go over here." No, no, no. It'll be
[1:37:35] popping everywhere.
[1:37:38] I love grits cuz, you know, it reminds
[1:37:40] me of a real revival.
[1:37:44] You put the heat on it, don't care where
[1:37:45] it pop pop. [laughter]
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; You almost have to jump out the way so
[1:37:49] it won't burn you.
[1:37:52] I'm sorry, brother.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; I just come to be a blessing this
[1:37:57] morning.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Listen, the exposition of the seven
[1:38:02] church age, he says before he revealed
[1:38:04] the characteristics of the last age to
[1:38:06] us, he gives us one final look at his
[1:38:09] own gracious supreme deity.
[1:38:12] This is the capstone relation of
[1:38:16] himself.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thus said the amen.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus the amen of God. Jesus is the go.
[1:38:26] So so let it be of God. Amen stands for
[1:38:30] finality. I I don't know about you sir
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; but I am the amen.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; You say brother Brooks if you're not
[1:38:42] there are you there yet?
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; It all depends where you're looking
[1:38:45] from. Yeah, that's right.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; If you're looking from earth, I'm not
[1:38:49] there yet.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; If you're looking from heaven, I'm
[1:38:52] already there.
[1:38:55] [laughter]
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; And one of these old days, we getting
[1:39:00] ready to to unite in such a way we will
[1:39:03] change d Oh, come on. We'll change
[1:39:06] dimensions.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. I was telling my
[1:39:10] church, I said, "If God told John to
[1:39:13] come uph come up higher,
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; you got to come up higher."
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can't get this
[1:39:19] revelation and understand it being
[1:39:21] carnal.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; You got to [screaming] come up higher.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; You got to change that mention or let
[1:39:26] the dimension change you
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; because Amen. the revelation comes from
[1:39:31] there.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And drops into your heart.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The greatest revelation of
[1:39:39] my time
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; is to know that Christ is in me.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Yes. All the other revelations of uh you
[1:39:49] know go through Genesis all of that and
[1:39:51] I can I got stuff in my notes. But let
[1:39:54] me say it like this. He said in that day
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; you know that I'm in the father
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; the father's in me
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; and I am in you. Yeah.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you right now, which I
[1:40:04] wouldn't want it happen, but if I drop
[1:40:07] dead right now,
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; I know where I'm going.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; I didn't say I hope. I said I know
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; where I'm going.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of assurance we need.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; That's what gives us strength.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Can I testify just a minute? Amen.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; I normally walk around my neighborhood,
[1:40:28] you know, a little exercise
[1:40:30] and I was had brother Brandham on my
[1:40:33] headset and I'm just walking [snorts]
[1:40:36] and uh whether it be vision, whatever it
[1:40:38] was, I saw this dog and the dog, it was
[1:40:40] vision, okay? I saw this in a vision, a
[1:40:43] dog, big old German shepherd coming at
[1:40:46] me. And you know when you're in a
[1:40:49] vision, you don't know it. right?
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; You're just seeing things and sometimes
[1:40:53] you think it's just your imagination.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; But here I was having this vision and um
[1:40:59] and and but the the voice said to me
[1:41:03] when this happened, "Stand still."
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; And just as I turned, didn't even know
[1:41:12] the neighbor had a German Shepherd. This
[1:41:14] dog was huge. Looked like it was mixed
[1:41:17] with wolf or something. It was so big.
[1:41:19] It was so big. Yeah.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; And he was coming straight at me with
[1:41:22] his mouth all open like he's going to
[1:41:24] tear me up and his and and his owner
[1:41:26] whoever was keeping like so and so like
[1:41:29] talking to a dog like a human. What did
[1:41:31] he do to you? He didn't do nothing to
[1:41:32] you. Why you charging? You know, I'm
[1:41:34] like
[1:41:37] standing still. But I was listening
[1:41:40] and I was watching this dog. God is my
[1:41:43] witness. When the dog came close to me,
[1:41:46] he got confused.
[1:41:48] He circled me like this
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; and then he ran back to his master.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Now that was God.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; I was on a plane. Did I tell you about
[1:42:03] the plane trip?
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; American Airline. That don't don't buy
[1:42:07] cop, but it was American airline. Right.
[1:42:10] And we were going I was flying we flying
[1:42:12] towards Chicago in the winter. had
[1:42:15] already ascended into uh 30,000 milei we
[1:42:18] you know but prior to that they were
[1:42:20] having trouble with the plane.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Now I'm telling you this because these
[1:42:24] are the things that God expect us
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; expect to happen to us things that we
[1:42:29] can testify
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; this is God
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; and and while I was out here again now
[1:42:36] I'm I'm listening to brother Brandon
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:40] And the one of the flight attendants,
[1:42:42] she she break her thought or train of
[1:42:45] thought with some of these people and
[1:42:46] she comes and she said, "What is that?"
[1:42:49] And I I didn't know what she was looking
[1:42:50] at. She said, "That light." She she
[1:42:53] stuttered because she didn't want to say
[1:42:55] I still didn't pay her no attention.
[1:42:58] Then after a while, Amen. They called
[1:43:01] her back and says, "Okay, we're in
[1:43:03] trouble. The plane is in trouble." So
[1:43:06] she come back trying, you know how they
[1:43:08] do. They're trying to be calm.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; They're not calm. You can see it in
[1:43:12] their eyes.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; They're trying to be calm.
[1:43:16] Say, "We're having trouble. We're going
[1:43:18] to have to land somewhere." And there's
[1:43:20] the question. People said, "Well, where
[1:43:21] are we going to land?" Cuz if you look
[1:43:23] out the window, all you saw was snow.
[1:43:26] [snorts]
[1:43:26] And uh to make it short, I said, "Oh,
[1:43:28] God." I said, "You didn't tell me I was
[1:43:30] going to die today."
[1:43:32] cuz I really believe that when my time
[1:43:34] comes, he going to tell me.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; I don't believe I'm going away in
[1:43:38] secret.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Unless it's the rapture.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; But if I die otherwise, he going to tell
[1:43:43] me. I believe that for some reason. I
[1:43:45] know he will.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; And anyway, uh I was seriously scared.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Y'all weren't expecting that one, right?
[1:43:55] [laughter]
[1:43:57] A fear caught me. It's like something
[1:43:59] was choking me to death. Wow.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; I couldn't breathe.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Right. Then I heard something say,
[1:44:07] "Perfect love cast out fear."
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; As soon as it said that fear left.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; And I look at that stewardist flight
[1:44:17] attendant. I say, "It's going to be all
[1:44:19] right." And she said, "Okay, okay." And
[1:44:22] she was at peace from that point onise.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; And when we got to the we you know what
[1:44:27] it did circle back to the to the
[1:44:29] airport. They had the fire trucks. They
[1:44:31] had the ambulance. They had all every
[1:44:33] all the equipment just in case there was
[1:44:35] a crash.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; And she warn us, don't don't get too
[1:44:38] excited. I'm thinking to myself, don't
[1:44:40] get excited. But the point is, you was
[1:44:42] excited, but you don't want us to get
[1:44:43] excited.
[1:44:47] But anyway, when we landed, I thought,
[1:44:49] "Wow, what an opportunity to talk to
[1:44:51] this lady."
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Well, got in the terminal. Lady didn't
[1:44:55] want to talk to me.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; See, that's how quick it comes and goes.
[1:44:59] Yeah.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? She saw God.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; But she didn't really want him after she
[1:45:04] got back on the land.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; I'm like, Lord, what is that?
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; It's just like the 10 lepers.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Some the ones who was healed only what,
[1:45:15] one, two came back to say, "Thank you,
[1:45:17] Lord."
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; See, that's how it is.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; You know, but we have a testimony
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; that somebody who was and maybe down the
[1:45:27] road she'll be saved. I don't know.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; But the point is, Amen. By the grace of
[1:45:31] God, God wants to use you.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; But you think that your these things of
[1:45:36] tragedy has come to you to destroy you.
[1:45:39] No. It comes to build you.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; You're the Amen.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Hey, it's true. It's true. It's true.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; It's so true. And and um
[1:45:57] [snorts and clears throat]
[1:45:58] I'm coming I'm almost done, but I'mma
[1:46:00] I'm coming back to the mind. I'mma close
[1:46:02] with this in your mind. Is this okay,
[1:46:04] pastor?
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Okay. I don't want to take too long cuz
[1:46:07] I know I do. But uh I want you to
[1:46:12] protect your mind.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; I came to say that because uh this
[1:46:17] message has to be ingested, as I said,
[1:46:20] and digested.
[1:46:22] And you've got to bring it here. And
[1:46:25] that's what we do when we eat. You know,
[1:46:27] like we know that uh you know uh Adam
[1:46:30] didn't eat an apple.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; But he ingested the information and he
[1:46:36] acted it out. That's
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; And and when you take this message, you
[1:46:41] got to take it personally.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; You know, like you're not looking at God
[1:46:45] was talking to somebody in 1963. God is
[1:46:48] talking to me
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; right now. Yes.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; And when you start taking it like that,
[1:46:53] it seemed how it changes you.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Am I making sense?
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; I could not have changed myself.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; And and when I came to the message,
[1:47:02] guess what? I was still broken.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Anybody can witness. I was still broken.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; It was this message that mended me. God
[1:47:13] through this message mended me.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:20] Fix me if I could say it.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Did it come through struggles?
[1:47:25] Absolutely.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Heartbreaks.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; No. People are or you know God has
[1:47:32] ordained people to upset you.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; You say I don't have no enemy. Well, I'm
[1:47:42] going to tell you something. Before you
[1:47:43] get out of here, God going to give you
[1:47:45] enemies.
[1:47:48] You need enemies.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; You know, I I don't mean to be funny.
[1:47:54] I'm not trying to be, but it's true.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; You need somebody to dislike you.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; That's when you know you got the real
[1:48:01] thing.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; That you can even love the unlovable.
[1:48:04] [screaming]
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. People who look at you and
[1:48:09] then you know in their eyes they're
[1:48:11] cutting you down.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, y'all don't know what I'm talking
[1:48:14] about.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Yes. in this message.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, y'all don't know Sister Sanctified.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; The more religious they are,
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; the more mean and evil.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't mean to step on nobody toe,
[1:48:41] but I just did, I guess.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; But my point is, Amen. Your religion is
[1:48:45] not going to save you.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; You got to be born again.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother Brooks, that ain't deep
[1:48:55] enough." Okay.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Ephesians the first chapter
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; and I'm going bring it to an end. But I
[1:49:05] find out that your mind, y'all, how how
[1:49:10] many times you've gotten disgusted with
[1:49:12] yourself? Amen.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Because you allowed yourself to put too
[1:49:16] much time into nonsense.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; The devil knows what he's doing now. He
[1:49:24] He's a smart fella.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; And he knows that God wants your mind.
[1:49:29] See, everything that God wants for you,
[1:49:32] the devil wants it for his own purpose,
[1:49:34] too.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; And he knows if he can get your mind,
[1:49:37] he's he's he's literally holding you up.
[1:49:40] He cannot stop you,
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; but he can hold you up.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; And uh so the mind is so important. And
[1:49:49] you know, I'm praying. I'm always
[1:49:50] praying, Lord, help me. Help me. Help
[1:49:52] me. Keep my mind stayed on you. Keep my
[1:49:54] mind stayed on you.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; One way or the other. If it's not songs,
[1:49:59] let it be praises. If it's not praises,
[1:50:01] that you say, "What?
[1:50:03] What kind of life [screaming] is that?"
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; The kind I'm going to live in heaven.
[1:50:09] Amen.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; And if you can't enjoy it here, you
[1:50:12] won't enjoy it there.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; All y'all talk about is Jesus. Hello.
[1:50:17] What are you going to talk about when
[1:50:19] you get up there?
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; There ain't going to be no Fox and no
[1:50:23] CNN and all that nonsense.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Everything will work. It be worship.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; It'll be praise.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; It'll be a life.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; You'll be working and you still have
[1:50:35] your mind on Jesus. Everything you do
[1:50:38] will be because of him.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Yes. You'll be doing things that, you
[1:50:43] know, you're not going to be sitting up
[1:50:45] in no big lounge chair.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; No, you going to be doing some stuff.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Think about it. I think about those
[1:50:54] ceream chair all they saying holy, holy,
[1:50:56] holy. You know, and you think, well, you
[1:50:58] know, that's typed. You know what I
[1:50:59] mean? But the point is,
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; they don't seem to get tired.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And a true Christian don't get
[1:51:05] tired of worshiping God.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Oh man, I got to go to church again.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; you going to go to church again. And I'm
[1:51:14] going to tell you something. I I tell my
[1:51:17] church, you know, I I I test them
[1:51:18] sometime cuz, you know, I could have
[1:51:20] church every day.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Seriously.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Tired or not, I can have church every
[1:51:28] day. In the apostolic church, that's
[1:51:30] what it was almost anyway.
[1:51:33] They always had something going on and
[1:51:35] you always had to be there if you were
[1:51:36] spiritual.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. When I say I can have church all
[1:51:45] every day, they get quiet.
[1:51:51] Well, how I'm going to do this? Well, I
[1:51:53] don't know. But I can have church every
[1:51:54] day. I'm the preacher.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; And I mean that. I don't have problem
[1:52:00] with church. Yeah.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Having service I don't
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; if it wasn't for CO we'd have
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; CO took one of my services.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; I still haven't gotten over it yet.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Nobody fought for it, brother. They
[1:52:19] didn't fight.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; I was expecting somebody said, "No,
[1:52:23] Brother Brooks, don't cancel service."
[1:52:25] Not one person.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; So I was disappointed.
[1:52:30] I go with what the people want.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. First Ephesians 1:17. I
[1:52:41] don't want to grieve you, but that's
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; that that amazes me.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; Can I y'all have prayer service here?
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; How many people show up?
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't Yeah.
[1:52:59] Oh, but I love the Lord.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; That's what they say.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; I love the Lord. And you can't even talk
[1:53:05] to him.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; I don't mean to scone you, but my point
[1:53:09] is something's wrong.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Y'all don't think I know what I'm
[1:53:16] talking about. Brothers and sisters,
[1:53:19] when y'all first fell in love,
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; That's all you thought about.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; That's all you talk about. That's right.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; To your best friend. She knew when you
[1:53:28] called what you were going to talk
[1:53:30] about,
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; that's what it was.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; It's It's amazing that you could be in
[1:53:37] love with God and don't talk about him
[1:53:39] that much.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; It
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; I love talking about the Lord.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; You can ask anybody that's around me
[1:53:48] when I'm fellowshipping. I'm going to
[1:53:49] talk about Jesus.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; I'm going to talk about the Lord cuz
[1:53:53] that's him. That's me. That's
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; my love affair.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Anyway, let's move on. I'm almost done,
[1:53:59] sir. I'm almost done.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Ah, Ephesians 1. that the God of our
[1:54:05] Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,
[1:54:08] may give unto you the spirit of wisdom
[1:54:11] and revelation in the knowledge of him,
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; the eyes of your understanding, being
[1:54:18] enlightened, that you may know what is
[1:54:21] the hope of his calling and what the
[1:54:24] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[1:54:27] in the saints.
[1:54:29] And that is and what is the exceeding
[1:54:32] greatness of his power to usward who
[1:54:35] believe according to the working of his
[1:54:37] what? Mighty power.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; He wrought in Christ when he raised him
[1:54:43] from the dead and set him at the right
[1:54:45] at his own right hand in heavenly
[1:54:48] places.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Now I I look at this and I'm like, what
[1:54:51] is wrong with us? Lord, kill this flesh.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. kill this flesh. So these words
[1:55:01] spoken
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; will live in me.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:08] [clears throat]
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; And and and then you go and you say,
[1:55:10] "What do you mean?" And you you find
[1:55:12] that Jesus prayed in John and talks
[1:55:14] about the glory that he had with the
[1:55:16] father before.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; And then he says, "Lord, give them this
[1:55:20] glory."
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; Do you want it?
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; My point is, Amen. It's it's your
[1:55:25] position that God elevates you to,
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, we came in as a sinner
[1:55:32] saved by grace, but grace going to take
[1:55:35] me to the throne.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; He's going to take me to the position
[1:55:39] where I can say like Jesus in John
[1:55:42] 10:30. I and my father are one.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; I want It [screaming] doesn't matter
[1:55:49] whether people like me or not. Right.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to tell you that's your goal.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; And Jesus will take you there.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; But you got to want it.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "You have not
[1:56:02] because you ask not."
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; I'm the kind of Christian I used to
[1:56:09] [snorts] play basketball, football, ran
[1:56:11] track, all that stuff.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Don't mean to jump on nobody,
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; but when I got saved, none of that
[1:56:19] mattered. Amen.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; That's just the way it was. And I look
[1:56:27] at now, I tell you what, nothing ain't
[1:56:29] going to keep you like Jesus.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you put out there.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't mean to get that
[1:56:36] way, sir. I'm sorry. But let me move on
[1:56:39] by the grace of God. You know, my I have
[1:56:41] a zeal.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; For the people
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; because you got to overcome.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Right.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Every one of us has to overcome the lust
[1:56:49] of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and
[1:56:51] the pride of life.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; And the only way you can overcome is
[1:56:55] that Jesus overcome for you.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; And I don't mean in just your thought or
[1:57:00] your mind. It's a reality.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; It's a reality. And and and and and how
[1:57:07] are you going to know unless you are
[1:57:09] enlightened?
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Your mind has to be changed. The Bible
[1:57:13] said, "Let this mind be in you that was
[1:57:15] in Christ." He can change your mind.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand what I'm saying?
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Let me say it like this. There was a
[1:57:24] time there was certain foods that I just
[1:57:27] loved.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Like cinnamon rolls.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; I was addicted.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Chocolate. I can eat chocolate now and I
[1:57:39] can eat a cinnamon roll, but I'm not
[1:57:40] addicted.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Right. There were times, amen, that I'll
[1:57:44] be at home and and and that cinnamon
[1:57:46] roll would call my name.
[1:57:49] Y'all know what I'm talking about.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; It's like something talks to you. You
[1:57:52] know, you need, you know, you and your
[1:57:54] buzz, your your your everybody,
[1:57:57] everything, your senses start smelling
[1:57:58] and tasting.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; And I don't mean it, but it's real.
[1:58:02] Y'all know what I'm talking about.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; And before you know it, you in your car
[1:58:05] and you're going to get that cinnamon
[1:58:07] roll. And what happens if that cinema
[1:58:09] roll is not there?
[1:58:14] But see, that's an attraction. There's
[1:58:16] something your body is attracting you to
[1:58:18] and it's calling for calling [screaming]
[1:58:21] calling you.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; So is the word of God.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; If Jesus in you, Amen. He going to call
[1:58:27] you to pray. He going to call you to
[1:58:29] read your Bible.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; He's going to call you to listen to the
[1:58:32] tapes. It's something that pulls you and
[1:58:35] you can't get with get away from it.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; It's not, oh, I'm being forced. go. It's
[1:58:41] something that calls you [screaming] and
[1:58:43] you say, "Amen."
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God has never called me to
[1:58:47] fellowship and I was disappointed.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Never.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Never.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What do you say, brothers?
[1:58:59] I'm saying the Bible said the kingdom of
[1:59:00] God is with within you.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Whatever they doing in the kingdom, I'm
[1:59:05] doing it.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God. That make sense?
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Whatever. So, I say like this. Continue
[1:59:14] to eat the book.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; Continue to meditate on it. Continue to
[1:59:18] study it. You probably say, "Well, let
[1:59:20] me stop." But anyway,
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; you need to just d you know,
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; don't don't let it get away from you.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Cuz I remember I remember when when a
[1:59:31] group of us came to the message in South
[1:59:33] Carolina, no matter where you went, you
[1:59:36] hear a tape. Hallelujah.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Sometime you approach the house and you
[1:59:40] hear the voice.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:59:45] you don't hear nothing.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Is that true?
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; There people don't they don't they don't
[1:59:51] play their tapes anymore.
[1:59:54] That's
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not pushing tapes, but I'm saying it
[1:59:59] was that voice was what is what brought
[2:00:01] me here.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; This is the only age
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; ever where we caught the voice of God.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; And that voice speaks.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; That voice delivers.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about a man's voice.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the voice of God.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; And and and I'm going tell you
[2:00:22] something. The devil, if he can get you
[2:00:24] away from it,
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; He knows eventually he's got a he he's
[2:00:29] going to trap you with a trap.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Right. People of God, don't let your
[2:00:35] thirst die.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; Don't don't don't do it. I don't care
[2:00:39] how busy you get. And I find out that a
[2:00:42] lot of time, you know, I people get a
[2:00:45] little bit of money. And I'm closing
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden they they got all
[2:00:51] these things they want to do
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; and they forget who gave them the money.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's Bible said when
[2:00:59] Israel when Jessron Israel uh uh got
[2:01:02] fed, Jessron got fat, they begin to
[2:01:04] kick.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; And that's what happens to a lot of us.
[2:01:07] This is Leodysia. This is a spirit that
[2:01:10] we we have to fight every day.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; But if you stop fighting, it's going to
[2:01:15] capture you.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; You know, we're not in a place where the
[2:01:22] word becomes boring.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:25] My wife is here, but she'll tell you
[2:01:27] there was a young lady in that apostolic
[2:01:29] church I thought I was interested in.
[2:01:31] Didn't know that my wife liked me at the
[2:01:33] time
[2:01:35] and she was a pretty girl. But one day
[2:01:37] in Wednesday night service, she left
[2:01:39] out. I don't know whether she thought I
[2:01:40] was going to follow or not, but I
[2:01:42] didn't.
[2:01:43] And I asked her after service, I said,
[2:01:45] "Why did you leave out?" She didn't even
[2:01:47] know in my heart. I thought this could
[2:01:50] make be a a nice wife.
[2:01:53] And she said it got boring. Guess what
[2:01:55] happened? I crossed her off the list
[2:01:57] quickly.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; The word of God, we didn't have much,
[2:02:03] but it wasn't boring.
[2:02:06] [laughter]
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying?
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. If the word is boring,
[2:02:10] [screaming] something's wrong.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; And to this day, she don't even know it.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; But I crossed her off quick. Quick.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I could care less.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; You don't love the word, you can never
[2:02:25] love me.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; I trust you were blessed.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; I I moved everywhere but on my sermon.
[2:02:38] [laughter]
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; So I Hey, y'all did this. Don't blame
[2:02:41] me.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us stand.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; There is power. Power. Wonder working
[2:02:52] power in the blood
[2:02:56] of the lamb.

[2:03:11] wonder working power in the blood

[2:03:24] blood of the lamb. Would you be free?
[2:03:27] Oh, would you be free from your burden
[2:03:31] of sin? There is power. Hallelujah.
[2:03:35] Power.
[2:03:37] Oh, would you over evil of victory?
[2:03:42] There is wonderful power.
[2:03:45] Hallelujah. There is power, [screaming]
[2:03:49] power, wonder working power in the blood
[2:03:53] of the lamb.
[2:03:56] Oh, there is power,
[2:03:58] power, wonder working power in the
[2:04:01] precious blood of the lamb.
[2:04:06] I will enter his gates with thanksgiving
[2:04:09] in my heart. I will enter his throne
[2:04:13] with praise.
[2:04:15] I will say [music]
[2:04:18] thank the Lord.
[2:04:20] Oh we rejoice.
[2:04:23] [music]
[2:04:24] Hallelujah he.
[2:04:27] Hallelujah he. [music]

[2:04:39] Oh.
[2:04:42] [music]
[2:04:43] There is power. There is power, power,
[2:04:47] wondering [music] power in the blood.
[2:04:50] Hallelujah.
[2:04:52] Thank you, Jesus. There [music] is
[2:04:54] power, [singing]
[2:04:56] power, wondering power in the precious
[2:05:00] blood of the lamb. [singing]
[2:05:04] Hallelujah.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; That blood still reigns. It still
[2:05:10] prevail. Amen.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; We know it's not the literal blood, but
[2:05:14] it's the [music] life of the blood.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; That eternal life. Amen. That God,
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that never fails.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; We appreciate
[2:05:29] everything and we trust you were
[2:05:32] blessed.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; I um somebody needed uplifting, I guess.
[2:05:38] Amen. [laughter]
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; I didn't mean to sound like I was joking
[2:05:42] or anything, but uh
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; but the truth of the matter is, you
[2:05:46] know, God [music] God loves joy. He
[2:05:48] loves he he's he he has humor. You know,
[2:05:51] he he you know, it's it's just sometime
[2:05:54] I think we get to,
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; you know, sir,
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; loosen up a little bit.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; And I trust that's what happened to you
[2:06:01] this morning.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; You could at least say I left out of
[2:06:04] church laughing.
[2:06:08] Sorry, brother.
[2:06:11] I get carried away sometimes, especially
[2:06:13] when I see people happy.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; That's what it's all about. This message
[2:06:18] came to make you happy.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; You know, I can't envision the children
[2:06:23] of Israel leaving out of Egypt
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; with sorrowful faces.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I can't even believe that
[2:06:31] the children of Israel, [music]
[2:06:32] you know, when they saw the walls of
[2:06:34] Jericho fall, like, "Oh my God, what
[2:06:37] have we done?"
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; No, they were rejoicing.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; The enemy is dead.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; That's what this message says. The enemy
[2:06:47] is dead. He's destroyed. It's over.
[2:06:52] Hallelujah. God gave us the victory and
[2:06:55] we ought to always praise him,
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; worship him.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He's worthy.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's what you're going to do
[2:07:02] over there. You might as well get
[2:07:04] started.
[2:07:06] [music]
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. We appreciate you. I know you got
[2:07:10] a baptism, brother.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; The joy of the Lord is [music] my
[2:07:18] strength. The joy of the Lord is my
[2:07:23] strength. [music]
[2:07:24] The joy of the Lord [singing]
[2:07:27] is my strength. The joy of the Lord is
[2:07:31] my [music and singing] strength.
[2:07:33] He gives me living water and I thirst
[2:07:37] [music] no more. [singing]
[2:07:39] He gives me living water and I thirst no
[2:07:42] more. [music]
[2:07:43] He gives [singing] me living water and I
[2:07:46] thirst no more. The joy of the Lord is
[2:07:51] my strength.
[2:07:53] And he keeps [music and singing] me by
[2:07:54] his power and I have no fear. He keeps
[2:07:58] me by his power and I have no
[2:08:01] [music and singing] fear. He keeps me by
[2:08:04] his power and I have no fear. The joy of
[2:08:09] the [singing] Lord is my strength.
[2:08:11] [music]
[2:08:12] He heals the brokenhearted and they cry
[2:08:15] [music and singing] no more. He heals
[2:08:18] the brokenhearted and they cry no
[2:08:20] [singing] more. He heals the
[2:08:23] brokenhearted and they [music] cry no
[2:08:25] more. The joy of the Lord is my
[2:08:29] strength.
[2:08:31] And the word [music] of faith is mighty
[2:08:33] even in [singing] thy mouth. The word of
[2:08:37] faith is mighty even in thy [music]
[2:08:40] mouth. The word of faith is mighty even
[2:08:43] in thy [singing] mouth. The joy of the
[2:08:47] Lord is my strength. [music]
[2:08:49] Oh, the joy of the Lord. It is [singing]
[2:08:53] my strength. [music]
[2:08:55] The joy of the Lord is my strength. The
[2:09:00] joy of the Lord [music]
[2:09:02] is my strength. The joy of the Lord is
[2:09:07] my [singing] strength.
[2:09:09] Amen. [music] Praise God. Amen. I'm so
[2:09:13] glad brother Brooks just relaxed and
[2:09:16] delivered exactly what the Lord gave him
[2:09:18] to deliver.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Even when he didn't think he was going
[2:09:21] to deliver. Amen.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; It was what we needed.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; How many of you testify that was exactly
[2:09:26] what you needed?
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Benham said this life
[2:09:30] isn't easy. He said it's not supposed to
[2:09:32] be easy. [music]
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and like the brother said,
[2:09:36] that's for our good. That's for our
[2:09:38] benefit. We have to be overcomers and
[2:09:40] the word must prevail.
[2:09:43] But there's a way in which the the
[2:09:46] trials of life begins to beat on us and
[2:09:49] there's a there's a a robbing of joy and
[2:09:52] there's a a crust that begins to build
[2:09:54] up. But oh, I felt like today the crust
[2:09:57] was broken off a little bit. Amen. Break
[2:10:00] off that crust. Amen. That there'll be
[2:10:02] troubles tomorrow. So what? I'm still
[2:10:04] saved.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; The word is still true. My name is still
[2:10:07] in the book. Amen. The victor has come
[2:10:09] forth and taken the book and purchased
[2:10:11] redemption and brought back redemption
[2:10:13] claims to earth. So what? My new trouble
[2:10:15] is not going to change that revelation.
[2:10:17] It's still true.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's be happy. Amen. That was
[2:10:23] good for me.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Real good for me.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; And I'm so thankful God knew exactly
[2:10:28] what we needed. [music]
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Nothing's by circumstance. God is
[2:10:33] deliberate in every move he makes and
[2:10:35] everything [music] he does. And I don't
[2:10:37] want to forget what I heard this morning
[2:10:38] just because I walk out the door and
[2:10:40] have other things in life. I want to
[2:10:42] come back to this. I want to meditate on
[2:10:43] this and say, "God, [music] let me
[2:10:46] realize how blessed I am, how happy I
[2:10:49] am, how much you've done for me, and let
[2:10:52] me shake off the crust of the world and
[2:10:54] the trappings of circumstance. And the
[2:10:56] devil's trying to just hold me back. But
[2:10:58] I'm not going to be held back
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; because I'm free. I'm already free.
[2:11:03] There's nothing he can do to bind me
[2:11:04] because Christ has made me free. [music]
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:11:10] But there was some encouragement. I got
[2:11:11] some things I needed to hear.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; We got to stay consecrated. [music]
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; We got to keep our mind consecrated.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not just laying around and
[2:11:22] and and being happy, but it's fighting
[2:11:24] to stay in the mind of God. The right
[2:11:26] mental attitude, the right thoughts,
[2:11:28] [music] Amen. from the word to keep us
[2:11:30] happy and enjoying what God has given to
[2:11:32] us.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; So I must stay consecrated
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; and fight [music] to keep my mind stayed
[2:11:38] on him.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; And then I can rest.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; And enjoy my salvation. [music]
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is good. Amen. We're going to
[2:11:48] have a baptism. So with brother Emanuel
[2:11:51] Bondo, if you would like to go around
[2:11:52] back and get prepared, we are excited to
[2:11:55] see you [music] take this step in the
[2:11:56] word, Lord. Amen. for the word of the
[2:11:58] Lord and we're exci exc excited to see
[2:12:00] what God will do for you and where he's
[2:12:02] brought you to.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just before we say a word of
[2:12:06] prayer, I just want to give a happy
[2:12:08] birthday greeting to Levi Brooks.
[2:12:10] [music] I don't know where he went. He's
[2:12:12] gone.
[2:12:13] He left out,
[2:12:15] but I think he turned 16 today. So, it's
[2:12:18] a big one. Amen. So, may the Lord bless
[2:12:21] him. And Levi, wherever you're at, be
[2:12:23] careful driving on the road, buddy.
[2:12:26] Amen. Let's bow our heads together.
[2:12:30] Dear heavenly father, we're so thankful,
[2:12:32] Lord, [music] that we can say we're your
[2:12:35] children. That by a divine revelation
[2:12:38] that you've planted in our hearts, Lord,
[2:12:40] from our souls. We've been given a true
[2:12:43] identification, Lord. Spiritual amnesia
[2:12:46] is broken away. The confusion that came
[2:12:48] from sex birth is gone. But we know,
[2:12:51] Lord, where we came from because you've
[2:12:53] revealed it to us, Lord. We know who we
[2:12:56] are because you've revealed it to us.
[2:12:58] You know what we know what you're doing
[2:12:59] in this age because you revealed it to
[2:13:01] us. And we know where we're going
[2:13:03] because you have revealed it to us. God,
[2:13:06] let us set our mind on these things.
[2:13:08] Lord, forgive us for being distracted.
[2:13:10] Forgive us, Lord, for all the trappings
[2:13:12] that we've fallen into and the
[2:13:14] discouragement we've allowed to come and
[2:13:16] rest in our minds. But God, we want to
[2:13:18] take back, Lord, the the ground that
[2:13:20] we've given to the enemy. We want to
[2:13:22] consecrate our minds and our time and
[2:13:24] all of our thoughts and our hearts to
[2:13:26] you, Lord. And may we enjoy what you
[2:13:28] have given us and rejoice in it, Lord.
[2:13:31] May we be happy and rejoicing for I
[2:13:33] believe it's a pleasurable thing to you
[2:13:36] to hear your people happy and thankful
[2:13:38] and rejoicing for all you've done for
[2:13:40] us. May we, Lord, sing your praises
[2:13:43] clear. May we sing it from the the the
[2:13:46] depths of our soul from a true
[2:13:48] satisfaction and joy that can only come
[2:13:51] from the revelation of this hour. May we
[2:13:54] give back to you praises, Lord, as a
[2:13:56] sweet savor to your nostrils. We love
[2:13:59] you. We thank you for bringing our
[2:14:01] brother along and for using him as a a
[2:14:03] tool, Lord, to minister what we needed,
[2:14:05] Lord. And you know what I needed. You
[2:14:07] know what we needed, Lord. And you
[2:14:09] delivered it through our brother. May
[2:14:10] you bless him and his wife and his
[2:14:13] family as they travel back. Keep them

[2:18:48] Uh, brother Emanuel came to me last
[2:18:50] Sunday,
[2:18:52] expressed to me his desire to be
[2:18:53] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:18:55] Christ. He had never taken that step yet
[2:18:57] and he saw it in the word and God had
[2:19:00] been tugging at his heart and he was
[2:19:01] responding to the word and he wanted to
[2:19:03] fully obey. So, it's a great privilege
[2:19:05] for us as a body of believers to see our
[2:19:07] brother fully obey the word because we
[2:19:10] know obedience to the word puts him in
[2:19:12] line for a promise. And that promise is
[2:19:15] he shall receive the gift of the Holy
[2:19:17] Ghost. So, we're excited. So, brother
[2:19:19] Emanuel, upon your confession of faith
[2:19:21] in the Lord Jesus Christ because you
[2:19:24] want to be identified with him in death,
[2:19:26] burial, and resurrection and take his
[2:19:28] name in baptism. It's with great joy
[2:19:30] that I now baptize you in the name of
[2:19:33] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:19:38] Oh heavenly father, we thank you so much
[2:19:41] for this soul, Lord, that you have
[2:19:42] gathered to yourself that you have went
[2:19:45] out as a great shepherd and you found
[2:19:46] this lamb and you've brought him close
[2:19:48] and he's heard your voice. He's heard
[2:19:50] your call and he saw your word and he's
[2:19:52] obed obedient to that word and God, he's
[2:19:55] made a public declaration of faith. He's
[2:19:57] taken your name according to the word.
[2:19:59] He's given himself holy to you. Now I
[2:20:02] pray that you'd give him the promise
[2:20:03] that you promised that you would fill
[2:20:05] him with the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:20:07] May you spark this spark to life. May
[2:20:09] that spark light his candle. May it burn
[2:20:11] forever. And may it go from here a
[2:20:13] burning ember in the world, a bright
[2:20:14] light. And may you use him for your
[2:20:16] glory. May you shelter him, protect him,
[2:20:19] prosper him, and grow him from this
[2:20:20] point on into your very image. We ask it
[2:20:23] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God
[2:20:27] bless you, my brother.
