[0:00] I do not want to be part of something
[0:03] man has
[0:07] built not position not program not
[0:12] church not even
[0:15] manifestations nothing carnal nothing
[0:19] spiritual if man has built it I don't
[0:23] want any part of
[0:25] it I don't even care what position I
[0:28] would have in it maybe I'm number one
[0:30] maybe I'm number two maybe I'm number
[0:33] three if man has built it I'm
[0:36] out I don't want anything to do with
[0:39] it but if God is doing
[0:43] it if God has built
[0:49] it I would count it a
[0:52] privilege to be number 400 out of
[0:57] 400 and you know what's really really
[1:02] powerful about position
[1:06] 400 is if God has put me in position
[1:10] 400 I will never be position
[1:15] 401 and I don't have to worry about what
[1:19] number 401 is doing better than me I
[1:23] don't have to worry if number 401 is
[1:26] more spiritual than me I don't have to
[1:29] worry if number 401 has a better
[1:31] Ministry than me he'll never be 400
[1:35] because God made
[1:39] 400 so now your anxiety can just go away
[1:44] your depression can just go away that's
[1:46] right and you can just rest in the fact
[1:48] knowing I am number 400 amen and God has
[1:53] made me number 400 yes and I just thank
[1:57] God I'm part of the number amen amen and
[2:01] if God has made you part of the number
[2:03] nobody can take you out of the
[2:06] number so now if I
[2:10] see number one or let's move on down to
[2:14] the list if I see number
[2:18] 15 making a mistake falling out of the
[2:21] way not being as spiritual as he should
[2:23] or really just being a bad guy I don't
[2:27] have a problem going to him and trying
[2:30] to encourage him to get back into
[2:31] position number
[2:33] 15 because as a result of that I'm never
[2:36] going to be more than
[2:38] 400 if he falls out of number 15 God
[2:41] will put somebody else in 15 but it's
[2:43] not me I'm 400 I know my
[2:46] position so why don't I try to keep
[2:49] number 15 in his position and if he by
[2:52] chance falls out let's let's prop him
[2:55] back up let's pray for him let's
[2:56] encourage
[2:58] himen let's bring bring back to his
[3:00] memory You're Number
[3:03] 15 I'm using numbers but you can put
[3:06] positions in there whatever whatever
[3:08] example you want to put in there you get
[3:10] the principle amen amen if God has built
[3:14] it it's going to be sure and if God has
[3:16] built it we don't need to circumvent
[3:18] anything God if God has built it let's
[3:21] rest in what God has built
