[0:00] put on the whole armor of God. They may
[0:03] be able to stand against the ws of the
[0:05] devil because we're not wrestling with
[0:06] flesh and blood. He's saying, "Listen,
[0:08] I'm leaving you with this. You're headed
[0:11] for a spiritual battle. You're going to
[0:13] fight every day of your life to inherit
[0:16] the fullness of this promise."
[0:18] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean you've stepped into the
[0:20] millennium yet. There's still fighting.
[0:21] There's still war going on. There's
[0:23] still things to conquer. There's still
[0:25] places to overcome in our own lives.
[0:27] Amen. There's still promises that we
[0:29] want to see manifest amongst us in our
[0:31] own lives. Amen. But in order to do
[0:33] that, you're going to have to take on
[0:34] the mentality of a warrior and not get
[0:36] lazy cuz that's what happened to Israel.
[0:39] Israel stopped fighting and started
[0:41] farming. Amen. They stopped fighting and
[0:43] moved to the pleasures of their
[0:45] inheritance and stopped pressing for the
[0:47] fullness of the inheritance.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; So what does it denote? He leaves him
[0:53] with these instructions. Get your armor
[0:55] on. Put your shoes on, strap your belt
[0:59] on, get your sword in your head, and be
[1:01] praying all the time. Amen. Because this
[1:04] is not a physical thing. That's not a
[1:06] physical inheritance. It's a spiritual
[1:07] inheritance. It's a promise that he's
[1:09] given us. And what is the bride? She's
[1:11] the New Testament. That's all. So,
[1:13] whatever is in this New Testament is for
[1:15] us. Every promise is given to us by the
[1:19] Holy Ghost, by the death and
[1:20] resurrection of Jesus Christ, his blood
[1:22] purchased for us. everything his his his
[1:25] life returned to us to give us the power
[1:28] to possess all. Amen. Let's keep moving
[1:30] forward. Be a soldier. Don't be lazy.
[1:33] Don't start settling down and
[1:35] establishing ourselves and making wine
[1:38] and having feast. Let's keep moving
[1:40] forward and let let's move until we get
[1:42] the fullness of the inheritance in our
[1:44] possession.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; And what's the fullness of the
[1:47] inheritance? A new body.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51] I'm not going to be happy till I get a
[1:53] new body. Why? Cuz it's my promise for
[1:56] this age. And I'm not going to stop
[1:58] pressing. I'm not going to start taking
[2:00] my inheritance and living in my
[2:02] inheritance. Amen. and staying separated
[2:05] from the world and staying consecrated
[2:07] to God and loving him above all and
[2:09] keeping my mind and my heart and my body
[2:11] focused on him and keep myself under
[2:14] preparation of battle all the time
[2:16] because this inheritance in order to
[2:18] fully possess it is going to require a
[2:21] fight.
[2:23] &gt;&gt; But praise God, he equipped us for the
[2:25] fight. Remember, Ephesians parallels
[2:28] Joshua. And Joshua says, "Go take the
[2:31] land. You fight. I'll be with you.
[2:35] &gt;&gt; I'll fight for you. I'll drive them out.
[2:37] You go fight."
[2:40] &gt;&gt; It wasn't sitting back on their heels
[2:43] twiddling their thumbs while God drove
[2:44] them out. No. God says, "I'll fight for
[2:46] you when you're fighting.
[2:48] &gt;&gt; I'll drive them out when you're driving
[2:50] them out." Amen. And God will do the
[2:52] same thing for you and I, friends. When
[2:54] we're pushing against the devil, he'll
[2:56] push the devil out of the way. Amen.
[2:58] When we're taking the sword of the
[2:59] spirit with a strong hand of faith and
[3:01] driving through the heart of the enemy,
[3:02] he'll get behind us by the power of the
[3:04] Holy Ghost and push that sword forward.
[3:08] But we got to put on the full armor and
[3:12] be a warrior in this battle because
[3:14] Ephesians parallels Joshua.
