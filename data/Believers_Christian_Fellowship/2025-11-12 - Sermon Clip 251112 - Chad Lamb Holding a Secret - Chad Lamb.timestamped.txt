[0:00] It doesn't matter what other people
[0:02] think about you.
[0:05] It doesn't matter what other people say
[0:07] about you.
[0:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your vindication are the tokens
[0:12] that you hold in your heart.
[0:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And where did you get them? Where
[0:18] did you get this message? Listen, we
[0:19] didn't get this message from William
[0:20] Brandham.
[0:21] &gt;&gt; We got this message from Jesus Christ.
[0:24] &gt;&gt; Where did you get your token? That token
[0:26] didn't come Amen. just through from a
[0:28] preacher somewhere or a church. That
[0:29] token came from Christ.
[0:32] &gt;&gt; He's the one who has impregnated us.
[0:34] He's the one who's come in union with
[0:36] us. He's the one who's given us these
[0:38] tokens. And we received them from his
[0:40] hand. Why? Cuz we didn't want money.
[0:42] We're not a harlot. We didn't want a
[0:44] lustful nothing. What we wanted was
[0:46] redemption, the word, the truth, a
[0:48] restoration. The same thing Tamar was
[0:50] hungering for. She may not have
[0:52] understood the hunger. I believe there
[0:54] was a spiritual hunger driving her. But
[0:56] friends, there's a spiritual hunger
[0:58] driving us to this word and to this
[1:00] token.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; AND ANYTIME SOMEBODY BECOMES DRIVEN BY
[1:05] THE SPIRIT OF GOD, THEY BECOME AN
[1:07] ANOMALY. They become an outcast. They
[1:09] become SOMETHING STRANGE TO THE WORLD.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; They're willing to do strange things.
[1:13] Tamar was willing to do something very
[1:15] strange. Amen. IN ORDER TO BE PART OF
[1:17] THE REDEMPTION PLAN, TO BE PART of the
[1:20] word coming forth.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22] &gt;&gt; She was willing TO DO SOMETHING SO
[1:24] UNUSUAL. AMEN. BECAUSE SHE WAS DRIVEN BY
[1:27] A FORCE. SHE HAD TO PLAY THE PART. SHE
[1:30] HAD TO RECEIVE THE SEED. SHE HAD TO
[1:32] BRING FORTH AND AND PRESERVE the lineage
[1:35] of Judah. It was MORE THAN THE THOUGHTS
[1:37] OF A WOMAN. AMEN. IT WAS THE VERY
[1:39] THOUGHTS OF GOD THAT WERE DRIVING HER.
[1:41] AND FRIENDS, YOU AND I are driven by
[1:43] more than just our own desires and our
[1:45] own thoughts. There's a SEED GENE OF GOD
[1:47] INSIDE OF YOU PROGRAMMED TO REACH OUT
[1:49] FOR THIS SIGNATE RING TO REACH OUT FOR
[1:51] THIS LORD JESUS CHRIST AND SAY I'VE GOT
[1:54] TO HAVE THE SEED AND PLANTED IN ME. I'VE
[1:56] GOT TO COME INTO UNION WITH HIM. I'M
[1:58] HERE. AMEN. TO BRING FORTH THE PROMISED
[2:01] SON
[2:04] &gt;&gt; OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH.
[2:07] &gt;&gt; I'M ON THIS EARTH. [screaming]
[2:08] AMEN. IT'S FOR ME TO DO.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; YEAH. It's for ME TO BRING FORTH THE SON
[2:15] OF man again.
