========================================

and god is the fountain of all grace and power and of all divine wisdom is in god so therefore knowing that he is the only creator there is there is no other creator but god satan cannot create it all he only perverts what's been created but god is the only creator so because satan because satan has his own agenda he has his own plan satan cannot create any material to work with so he can only take the material that god created and deform it or pervert it into another purpose amen and when he can get when he could get the children of god to leave the channel of the word all of a sudden they became deformed and all creation became deformed and that was his power because he can't create or make anything he can only take what god made and deform it he can't bring his own word he takes god's word and he deforms it he can't bring his own creation he takes god's creation and deforms it so he perverts or deforms so that is his job that is his power to deform so satan loses all of his power when we refuse to leave the word he the only power he has is the power to deform he cannot create amen he cannot he cannot overpower god's word god could satan could never come in the garden of eden and overpower god's word he could only get god's children to leave the word or deviate from the word and that's how he expressed his power to deform but satan could not do that they had to do that he influenced them he deceived them he tricked them but they're the ones who had to leave the word so so satan is not going to come in amen to us and all of a sudden twist us in the knots and deform us we will do that of our own choice if we're deceived into leaving the channel of the word then we become perverted or deformed so what is the solution where is our safety amen what will keep us the line of the word the channel of the word and that's why it's so important that the word was restored to us in this day
