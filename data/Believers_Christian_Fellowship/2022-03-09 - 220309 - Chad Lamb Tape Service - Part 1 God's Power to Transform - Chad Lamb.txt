listen to this tape i pray god to be more than just a listening to a tape oh god would you give divine revelation on your word for we all can listen with human ears to words coming by vibrations of sound but we need more than that lord we need you to quicken the word in our hearts lord to make it alive in us to bring us revelation upon the word i pray that you would do so lord i pray that you would have your way with each one of us speak to us individually lord as you speak to us through the word we ask your blessings over all we say and do in jesus christ's name we pray amen while we're standing let's take our bibles i'm going to go ahead while we're standing together and read the opening scripture tonight we're going to go through the tape we're going to begin to go through the tape god's power to transform and brother branham opens up with a scripture out of romans chapter 12. so if you could turn there with me we'll read that before we're seated also we have some visitors here today sister naomi lau has her mother and her sisters here with her visiting from arizona so god bless you it's good to see you here amen it's always good to have visitors amen and family come in amen let's read romans chapter 12 verse 1. as i beseech you brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of god amen you can be seated tonight we're going to go through god's power to transform i think we're going to break this up into three segments each one will be roughly 45 minutes of the tape and we'll do this like we've been doing i i look back to see when we began doing this we started it in 2017. so this is our fifth year now and we like to do at least one tape together a year and it's been something i've very much have enjoyed over the last five years going through taking a tape with the book in hand or tablet or phone or whatever and going through it together but i want to back up and uh and go through the the whole beginning of this again so if we can pull up the powerpoint uh i want to remind those who maybe are new or the youth who are getting older now that back in 2017 we installed a message book rack in the back here in the foyer as you go out the back doors there brother elmer schwartz built this rack for us looks really nice and it fits in there perfect and it holds these these titles um the top rack the top six titles is what i asked the church back then in 2017 for the whole church to read in sequential order amen so if you haven't done that if you were five years ago if you were a tiny top but now you're a young teenager and you're interested in these things it'd be a good time to read these in sequential order if you're new if you haven't done that or if you would just like to go through it again to refresh yourself and we'll go through those titles in just a minute now the bottom six here are titles that get changed out every so often so always you can walk by the rack if you see a book that you don't have you can grab it out brother john pitzenberger helps keep that filled and he keeps the books ordered from voice of god there so we have the books we have went through several of those now and i'll talk about that in just a second so here's the top rack that's constantly the same six in order and they're in this order the spoken word is the original seed present stage of my ministry is this the signed of the answer the breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals the seventh seal and christ is the mystery of god revealed and there was a reason back then we asked for the church to go through those in that order amen because i had went through them in that order and they really were such a blessing to see the transition in brother branham's ministry as he was really coming in to fulfillment of revelations 10 7 which ties right back to malachi 4 and to catch it as he was going through that transition and made it from one into the other and when you go through these titles in that order it just pops out and comes to life and so if if you haven't done it in a while it would be good to listen to those or go back through them in that order if you've never done it i'd encourage you to do so because it really is quite a blessing and then this year we ordered four more titles god's power to transform which we'll go through tonight the greatest battle ever fought things that are to be and leadership and then if you go into the library right over here when you go into the library just behind the door you see this book rack this book rack has all the titles that we've ordered over the five years that we keep in stock and uh as you know voice of god quit printing the books and whenever they have an inventory will be the last of these books that they printed before the ones that we're accustomed to and so when they run out they run out so we're trying we try to keep an inventory of everything that we have and i think we have 40 titles now so i just went and counted and looked at it we have 40 titles with the four editions we have now and when i when we started doing this uh we started going through a tape i caught the inspiration five years ago because i really wanted you know brother brahm told us to sit down and study these things sit down and study these things and and i wanted to go through it together and in the format like we do tonight i'll ask questions ahead of time and we can be watching for the for brother branham to answer those questions as we go through this section of the tape but i did it because i wanted to together sit down and study a message together and i wanted some of the young people and those that are new to the message to learn how to feed on the message and glean from it and and get into it to draw out what god is speaking to us not just to read it as a book and not just to listen to it as background noise you know sometimes you play something and it's just noise you're talking and doing other things and and i do that every morning when i get ready i listen to the message and you know stuff will strike your heart but there's times you need to sit down and say what is god telling me in this message what is the message god's trying to get to me and so i wanted us to do that together so that the young ones amongst us can learn how to really dig in and study a message and glean from that uh what god is trying to teach us not just read it and said i read that book but what was he saying what was the point what was the message the prophet was trying to get across in that book what was god speaking what was significant about that book and what was significant about that message in the sequence of messages he preached and the timeline of his ministry where was he in his ministry what was going on in that time what did he preach before what did he preach after what was it that god was trying to get across to his church it was more than just reading a book and said i've read a book but reading to really understand and see what god was trying to speak to us so tonight we're going to read god's power to transform if you look at your book some of you have a tablet or your phone or whatever if you don't have a book they're out in the foyer on the rack you can run out and grab one really quickly or if you forgot yours but in god's powers to transform i've got the spoken word book here that we have out there if you open it to the first page it's got the title page you turn it over to the back of that title page and i always go through this because it to me this is what i do every time i pick up a book first thing i do is say what is the title of this book god's power to transform so what brother branham is going to talk to us about in this message what god has for us is a message on god's power to transform and i want to keep that in my mind the entire time i listen to this message that this is something he's bringing something about god's power to transform so i don't want to lose sight of that and you know brother bam's titles are amazing sometimes and then i look at the back and i want to see when was it priest and this says 65 09 11. so september 11th in 1965 that's also on the front left-hand corner of the book as well if you have a tablet when you do a search for the message it comes up on the right hand side how long the message is where it was preached and underneath the title or yeah and underneath the title it has or before the title has the date so you can always get the date to me the date's important because brother branham preached things in order as things were revealed and as things were opened up so it matters to me when he preached it so when you go and look at this there's a paragraph underneath there that just explains that the message was delivered on saturday morning september 11 1965 for the full gospel businessman's fellowship international breakfast at the ramada inn in phoenix arizona usa i always like to know where brother brennan was preaching because because it'll help you so many times understand why he phrases things certain ways in certain times there are certain times he'll be preaching he'll say something a certain way amen but that he doesn't say it that way in jeffersonville in his home church and brother branham is very much trying to get the people he's speaking to to understand what he's saying and when he's out with denominational people amen many times she'll say things in a certain way i remember one time after the opening of the seals brother branham is preaching to a crown and he's saying how do you know that your name may not be the last name that's written in the lamb's book of life tonight well that's totally contrary to what he teaches everywhere else he teaches that all names that were ever written in the lamb's book of life were written before the foundation of the world and it was sealed and no new name has been added since then but brother branham isn't changing his doctrine you don't go to that quote and say oh he changed his doctrine he changed his mind he never changed his doctrine he was speaking to the people sitting in that room trying to get them to understand trying to get them to grab a hold of the word so to me it's always important what he said what he's going to preach about the title when he said it in the sequence of his ministry and who he was preaching to so whenever i pick up a book or look at a message i always go through these things and every year i go through the same thing to remind us all the same things because to me these things have really helped me understand in a deeper way the message that god has given us so we're going to start on page one paragraph one and i've got some questions here so if you've got a pen and paper and you want to write down these questions as we go through the the tape we can uh answer these questions brother ben was going to answer every one of these questions there are no trick questions i'm not trying to trick you brother benham we'll just answer these questions as we go through and the reason that i do these is because one we want to learn how to glean from the message and two it helps us stay focused on what we're reading looking for god to answer these questions for us so the the question is what is the bible now listen don't go ahead and write the answer because there's a lot of answers that you can write but we're specifically looking for what brother branham says in the message what is the what is the bible is question number one what is the bible question number two what does the word transform mean i think he actually says transformed either transform or transformed what does the word transform mean now don't go ahead and fill in the answer let's see what brother branham says so number two what does the word transform mean and then question number three what channel must every seed stay in what channel must every seed stay in we'll give you just a second to get caught up because this screen will go away because we'll have the scrolling text of the message up so you won't have these questions after they disappear question number four what power does the enemy have what power does the enemy have and this one number five goes with that and what does he do with it what power does the enemy have and what does he do with it or what does he do with that power all right see people still writing so we'll let you get your last little marks in all right we're going to begin on page one paragraph one and today we'll go to page 14 and to the bottom of paragraph 91 it'll be right at just under 45 minutes so brother franco if you could go ahead and bring up the the video the scrolling text and the tape we'll go ahead and also i want to remind you don't forget to respond to the word just because we're playing a tape doesn't mean we have to go silent if something strikes your heart say amen stomp your feet clap your hands raise your hand whatever you normally do when you respond to the word respond to the word because as we listen to this get together it creates an atmosphere and there's a great atmosphere when we come together and as we respond to the word amen it's just as encouragement to the brothers and sisters and we just glean a little deeper as we do this together so don't fail to respond to the word all right god bless you brother franco thank you very much it's really a privilege to have brother branham come so often to phoenix i think he comes to phoenix more than anywhere and we want him to keep coming just as long as i'm around here anyway god bless you thank you brother williams good morning friends i am this uh the shakarian family uh brother williams and sister williams many of them here know about it i saw that in a vision about two three years before she got sick it happened and last year when we were here i believe is in january at the convention is the time that that priest what's his name i forget his name now but sharon stanley bishop stanley from the catholic church remember when he brought me the bible you know and he said to me it was several prophesying my daughter you're healed and he knew at the vision it said that she would not get well she would die between two and three o'clock in the morning remember that so two or three o'clock and i couldn't tell demons and yet i told her stepmother right over in the room right across the place here i said she isn't going to get well mr carrie said well everybody's prophesying i said of course i could be wrong myself but i said it she isn't going to get well i told many of them about three years ago i saw her running for her life and she went into a bed and she raised her hands and screamed to me like that and i i couldn't even reach her and then i seen her die and i looked there's something there's a clock and it said it's something between two and three o'clock and um so the bishop said well i'll just watch and see how that comes to pass so it did come to pass we are certainly sorry i feel the church has lost a great person sister florence to carry him but she was a great singer she was a spirit-filled woman i was with her mother her mother was one of the first contacts i had on the west coast when her mother was healed when the doctor she's in a coma and all swollen up and so then the doctor that was there told me said now be real quiet when you pray don't make much noise woman's dying i said yes sir and said and just kept on telling me well i didn't even have a chance to open my mouth like so his brother demas told me go ahead and go up and see her so i went upstairs in florence was kneeling on the floor then a beautiful little girl and some more women and went over and prayed for her and it's told and she was unconscious and told her she'd get up again and she did a couple years later she died and now god answers our prayers and we know that we believe that we are all have come here by the will of god and we lead the same way one by one will each one cross that portal and that's why we're here this morning together together in this christian businessman's fellowship is to speak of these things and prepare for them because we know they are sure to come ah sister florence is a young woman 42 years old brother williams just told me and very young but before they she knew that she had this disease why i saw a vision of her and told me her outcome then it would be god knows all about it and her seeing jesus in the room before she left we just don't want to pray for her because we've done that so much we just want to thank god for our life that was among us that inspired us all a sister chicarian and we want to pray for brother demas sister rose and remember they've had an awful hard hit in their life in the last there's his father and his sister now in his in the last years and yeah less than less than 10 months and um sister your sister edna also so i know how to sympathize with brother demas i had a father brother wife and baby to go within a few days apart so i i know how it feels this morning you only know when you stand in them shoes that's when you know how to sympathize and i did that myself excuse me i hit a little gadget down here somewhere with my hand so i'm i'm sorry i got it too loud and not meaning to so let us stand now while we if you can if it's it's power heavenly father we have a symbol here this morning to worship thee and to give thee thanks and praise for sending jesus our redeemer that we have a hope after this life is over seeing that it's so uncertain that we live here all the time and father to see the wretched conditions these bodies can get into we're glad we don't have to stay here all the time thou has made a way of escape down through the valley of death father we are grateful to you this morning for the life of one who stood with us less than a year ago singing your praises sister florence shakaran as we knew her and thou has told us long before even years that this was going to happen that it wouldn't be too much of a shock for us and we know what you say is true then your word says a man that's born of woman is full of few days and full of troubles we know that's true too lord we know we all must come down through that valley so we thank you for her life that was here on earth believing by faith that now this morning she has passed from this miserable pest house into a glorious body which can never be sick and her talents of singing and the voice she had and their spirit so richly grace with christ that she could return this morning she would not do it by no means she would have to go through all this again which now it's over she's with her mother and her daddy they call their baby home so we we thank you we also want to pray for comfort for our brother chicarian our dear beloved brother knowing the the life that he's lived and the torments he's going through in these last days and how he's seen aging and his hair slipping away and shoulder stooping and yet trying to stay on the field for god god give him strength today we pray god that you'll grant it to all those who have breathed over her going we pray for each one and let us lord as we are thinking of this remember that we too must go someday while we're sitting together here the presence of the lord jesus we would ask that you would bring this fresh to our memory let us check up as it was or take inventory of our own lives that we be under the blood and in the faith granted lord now as i try under these circumstances to bring a little message to the people today i pray that you'll help me lord strengthen me for i i need it lord and i pray that you'll grant it and may something be said that would just honor you if there be any under the sound of our voice this morning who is not ready to meet the hour that lays before them may this be the time that when they'll surrender to him who said i am the way the life the truth even our lord jesus christ for we asked it in his name amen be scenes brother here wants to know if everyone can hear all right he's got two mics on is that all right can you hear raise up your hands if you can can you hear raise your hands i'm sorry that we do not have seating room for everyone this morning and uh we trust that i won't stay up here too long just enough to maybe bring us maybe a reading of the word that the lord god will honor his word that's being read and will give us of his grace that we might serve him by now i was told by billy paul this morning that it might be possible that we speaking next sunday at the grant waste assembly of god in tucson if there's anyone here from tucson i might i get c this week uh be at the grant way assembly of god next sunday so now we just come back from up in the east and i kind of run myself down a little by overeating with over kindness of the people down in the mountains and and um i got sick and so i haven't felt good this week so you're pretty good for me and um why say brother carl williams with his sense of humor and i think we need it right now he said too much possum i don't know about that brother carl but a whole lot of [Laughter] squirrels so you want to pray for someone this morning why i certainly appreciate if it would be some of your prayer for me because i need it now we want to go quickly into the word and i don't want to keep you here too long because i believe there is a telephone hookup across the nation on this this morning goes all the way from the west coast to the east coast from north and south many many assemblies they've got this accommodation that you all had here from the tabernacle it's also hooked up in phoenix that everywhere the services is it comes right in to the and they gather in churches and in homes and things like that through a very fine way they say it's even better than a broadcast it's uh the telephone hookup they put a receiver or a microphone or whatever it is in the room and they my wife said coming from indiana last week down to tucson it's just the same as standing right in the room so we pray that god will bless all those out on the line this morning wherever they are up in new york now it'll be oh in the afternoon and uh different times uh as it crosses the nation now over in the book of romans the 12th chapter and the first and second verses we wish to read this scripture i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and perfect good acceptable and perfect will of god now if the lord willing i want to take it my subject for this morning on god's power to transform that you might not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind now and prove that which is that good perfect and acceptable will of god it's an old familiar text that many of your pastors has used down through your time it's been used since it was written but yet one thing about the word of god it never grows old because it's god it never grows old through every generation now for prayer near about 2 800 years or better this word of god has been read by man priest so forth and never does it grow old i've been reading it myself for some 35 years and each time i read it i find something new that i looked over the first time because it is inspired it is god in the letter form see it's the attributes of god speaking fall forth and is placed on paper many times man said well now man wrote this bible no the bible says itself that god wrote the bible it is the word of god and it it never can fail jesus said heavens and earth will fail pass away but my word shall never fail and it cannot fail in being god because it's part of him and then you being his son and daughter you're a part of it that makes you a part of him so that's why we come to fellowship together around the word of god now this word transform i looked up in the dictionary yesterday when i almost lost track of the time that i was to be up here uh when i was looking at for a text and i found this word or this text rather scripture and in the dictionary it says that it's uh something that's changed is to be changed transformed made different than what it was it's been its character and everything has been changed in it to transform and i thinking this morning in genesis 1 this world was without form and it was void darkness is upon the earth nothing but a complete chaos and when this world was in that condition the spirit of god moved upon the face of the water and the entire picture was changed from a total chaos to a garden of eden that's transforming power of god that can take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of it god's transforming power and we understand that i by reading the scriptures that god was 6 6 000 years and making this preparation for this eden now he might not have been that long but just pursuing and taking it from the scripture where it said one day with god is a thousand years on earth that is that god should count time and uh say it was six thousand years he had in making the earth and he had planted upon the earth all good seed there was just everything was perfect i think many times when even critics begin to read the book of genesis they begin to criticize it because it seems like it constantly repeats itself or throws you out here and there but if we would just notice for a moment before we get into our text that moses saw the vision and god spoke to him god spoke to moses face to face lift to ear now he never spoke to any other man like that as he did moses now moses was a great one of the greatest of all the prophets he was a type of christ and how god can speak he has a voice it's been heard god can speak and god can write god wrote the ten commandments with his own finger he wrote on the walls of of babylon once with his finger he stooped down and wrote in sand one time with his finger god can speak god can read god can write god is the fountain of all uh grace and power and of all divine wisdom is in god so therefore knowing that he is the only creator there is there is no other creator but god satan cannot create it all he only perverts what's been created but god is the only creator therefore he created by his word he sent his word so all the seeds that he had placed upon the earth he farmed those seeds by his own word or there was no nothing else to make the seed out of he placed them and they were beneath the water he just said let there be this and let there be that now we find out that many times it looked like the bible repeating or saying something to what it doesn't say for instance in genesis 1 we find that god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and then he goes on and many things happen upon the earth then we come to find out there was no man to till the soil then god created man out of the dust of the earth that was a different man and he breathed the spirit of life into him and he became a living soul the first man was in the image of god which is spirit john 4 says god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth but god is a spirit and the first man that he created was spirit man and he was in the image and in the likeness of god and then he put this man in flesh and man fell so then god came down and become in the image of man that he might redeem that fallen man that's the real gospel story to my opinion now god in 6 000 years had planted all these wonderful seeds or he had spoke his word it shall be this way this tree shall be this shall be everything was perfect it was just good and he commanded each one of those seeds that they would be they would transform themselves into the plant of which kind of life that the word of god has spoken in them should be if it was an oak tree it was to bring forth an oath if it was a palm it was to bring forth a palm because a great creator had just sent forth his word and the word seed was there before the real seed was ever formed and the word formed the seed so he made the world out of things that does not appear see he made the world by his word god spoke everything into existence and being god the creator speaking all things into existence it must have been a perfect world it was a beautiful place it was a a real genuine paradise here on the earth now as ever place has to have a headquarters somewhere uh this convention has a headquarters and uh this chapter has a headquarters and a church has a headquarters and god has a headquarters and so this great place nation that we live in it's got a headquarters and so this great eden had a headquarters and this headquarters was headed up in the garden of eden or in eden east of in the garden and god placed over this to rule all his great creation here on earth his son and his son's bride adam and eve god was the father of adam adam was uh the son of god according to the scriptures he was the son of god and god made him a help mate out of his own body perhaps a rib from over his heart so she'd be close to him and made him a helpmate it really wasn't his wife as yet no more than it was man as yet he just spoke it and there's where the trouble come satan her before adam did so it was just his word he had spoken i say that i don't want to spend too much time on it but some of you might get a bit confused some of the people up in the out in the south seem to find this a little confusing on the message that i have from god today to the people that um about the serpent scene and i'm going to go home the lord willing one of these days in jeffersonville i want about a six-hour message and straighten it all out see so to put it just in form and you'll know what we're speaking of and it's thus saith law as it was when you seen just the our sister florence before she went away several years see it's the truth and now we uh maybe it's misunderstood if somebody would come to me something contrary i would kind of misunderstand it myself i wouldn't want to criticize what anyone says we're not to criticize each other i'm not guilty of doing that i thank the lord i've criticized sin and unbelief but no individual persons yeah we're we're brothers and sisters striving we're coming down to where sister florence came uh yesterday mornings and see we we all got to come that way and it's not my purpose to try to criticize a brother or sister they wouldn't agree with you no far be it for me to do that i don't think you'll ever find a tape that i ever call anybody's name on which i felt that many times the person was wrong but that's between them and god but what is wrong in the way of sin and and misunderstanding sometimes it's not even sin it's just misunderstandings of people and i i think each one of us has a right to express herself to our understanding now this great creator had placed his created son now adam was his first created son jesus was his only begotten son he was begotten by a woman but adam was right straight from the hand of god in the creation now the headquarters with his his son and his son's bride overall it looks so perfect there was a a man the head of all of it his own son and his bride and every seed was perfect the palms and the oaks and the grass and the birds and the animals and everything was in perfect order with the commandment of god don't change your nature bring forth of its kind every seed oh don't you never be perverted into a papal tree see palm don't you be perverted into something else but every seed after his time and he it watched it through the times that he'd spoke the word and his great creating power had formed these things that come up and even the man and the woman and they were the head because they were the they were super to all the other races and he put them also under a care of the same thing that he put trees animals and so forth his word they must not never by no means break that word they must stay there don't never take anything from it or add anything to it you must live by this word and as long as that creation would have existed like that sister shakaran wouldn't have had to have went this morning as long as it was stayed like that god's great economy it's what we believe that we're headed back to we're going back to that spot that place where that seventh morning god looked upon it all and he said it's good hallelujah i'm pleased with it i'm glad i did it and it's all now under control and i have trust in my son and his wife that if they'll make them ahead of all of it that they'll watch over it all and see that it's all right that everything will bring forth of its kind now he has the power to do that god then said well if it's all so good and it can't be anything else because it's my own desire it's the way i want it and yeah i spoke it that way and my words has brought it justin exactly the way i wanted it and there it is it's all good so the bible said god rested the seventh day from all his works and everything under control to bring forth of its kind now remember to bring when he put the seed in the earth the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was his transforming power now god put the seed in there with potentials that it would be what he said it would be and as long as it stayed in its right category it would be just exactly what god said it would be it had to be that way because he had made it that way and made a channel that anything that stays in his channel in his line of word it will have to bring forth exactly like his word said it would do it cannot move from there it's channeled just exactly right so with everything and to trust in his own son that it would be that way then god said it's all good so i just rest and each one of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the species that i desire to be that's what it must be because i have given every seed transforming power to make out of itself in its potentials now to make out of itself exactly what i wanted to be god has never changed just the same today as he was then god's determined to do something he'll do it nothing's going to stop him he'll do it now after his all so well and set in order god felt assured now that this would all be all right and then when he did then came in the enemy i'm going to god gave power to transform and i'm going to call this fella with power not to to create again but um he had power to deform not transform but to deform not anything deformed is taken from its original state there's something that's gone wrong with it some years ago on patrol going up through the cornfields uh i would think of a there was a limb that brought off of a tree and it fell over on a stalk of corn and the stock was trying its best to get up straight like it was supposed to be but it was deformed because that something had happened and uh the stick was laying over then we find a wild creeper in the field which many you man here maybe some of you women if you come from kentucky the women uses the whole there is same as the man get out in the field with the with the hole we call the old gooseneck hole and chop the the creepers out for if you didn't get those creepers out where the corn was in the roll like this then that creeper would reach over grab a hold of that corn and wrap itself around gradually so easy so slightly that you hardly tell it was wrapping and finally gets stronger and stronger and it pulls that corn till it's deformed pulls it against itself wraps it around its own vine deforming it from what it was to something else yet it's corn but it's deformed upon and we are all still in the image of god but some are so deformed as sons of god that walk contrary to his word into the way that that he had us provided for us to walk setting something the world twist us out of the way pull us close to it and away from that straight narrow strip that he planted us in to be sons and daughters of god sin has done this evil thing to the sons and daughters of god the deformer i know this seems to be rather strange to speak of it in this way the the deform but that's what he was he deformed our perverted pervert needs to be changed over made something different and uh deform is the same thing that it's been brought over and deformed and made in another way yet it's still the same seed but it's dipone now we find that this deformer has also had the same amount of time to deform as god had to transform now he planted his seed or never planted his seed he in the garden of eden since that time he's had six thousand years of deforming the seed of god the word of god to deform it make it something different when he the first time that eve listened to him and got herself just one little phrase remember first satan quoted that scripture just as clear as it could be god has said that ye shall not eat of every tree in the garden of eden see you shall not eat of every tree and uh remember now eve said yes we may eat of every tree but the tree that's in the midst of the garden we mustn't even touch it i watch him in his message twist that word just a little bit and saying he said for god said that if we do this that day we die he said oh surely you'll not die see he was a a man he said you you do this now and you're you're kind of an ignorant people you really you don't know all things but if you would only partake of this then you would have wisdom you'd have knowledge you know right from wrong and be like gods you if you'd only partake of this wisdom that i have i know but you don't but it's all right to have wisdom but if the wisdom is contrary if the wisdom isn't correct wisdom from god divine wisdom and becomes natural wisdom i don't care how much science we have and want more education it's of the devil i'll prove it to you lord willing in a few minutes it's of the devil civilization is of the devil i just got through preaching on that all culture in the earth all the powers of science and everything is of the devil it's his gospel he preached of knowledge in the garden of eden and he's tucked that knowledge perverted knowledge contrary to the word and will and plan of god and now he's had six thousand years to do just exactly what god did only in a perverted way and took the same amount of time to bring his own eden in now he's got an eden here on earth and it's filled with wisdom knowledge that was his gospel at the beginning knowledge wisdom science never did god ever catered as such now i want you to watch a minute he did this and because it he was a man of worldly wisdom now it's hard to see this it's it's very hard because speaking to people who feel the same way i do and the way i have been for many years but since the opening of those seven seals of the angels just behind the mountain this has become a new book it's the things that's been hid as being revealed as god promised in revelations 10 he would do it and we are the privileged people that god has chosen of the earth that we might see and understand these things which is not some mythical fleshly mind of a person trying to make it up it's the word of god made manifest proven that it's right proven not by science but by god that it's right god as i have said before in a message god doesn't need anyone to interpret his word he's his own interpreter he says it'll happen and it happens that's he he confirms it that interprets it a few years ago when we pentecostal people when the other churches told us that we were crazy we could not the holy ghost is a thing pass but we find out that god's promise was to whosoever will and now we know different see that's just little by little this thing has opened up and now he promised that the mysteries that was hidden in those all of those church ages would be revealed right at the end time and it lets us know now we are at the end time we're here now now satan is the author of civilization he is the author of science he is the author of education he says that true all right let us read in god's word now genesis 4 and let's go back and just see for a minute i know i may if i get too long brother carl will probably tell me but uh genesis the fourth chapter in the 16th verse goes head telling here in the beginning what god did in order to place the curse upon the man and the woman and all that they was to do not the curse on them but tell them what would happen to curse the ground for adam's sake and we find out here now that eve had a pair of twins and one of them was of satan and one of them was of god now you say oh no now brother just a minute you find me one scripture anywhere that says that cain was adam's son i'll show you in the scripture where it says cain was of that evil one not adam now notice when she conceived here we begin at the fourth chapter first and adam knew his wife and she conceived and bear cain and said i have gotten she said now i have gotten a son from the lord of course there had to be no matter if prostitute or anything had come from god see because that's his seed it's a law of a seed it has to bring forth whether it's corrupted seed perverted seed or whatever it is it's got to bring forth anyhow it's his command and she again bear his brother abel no more knewing adam knew his wife and she barely came and also bear abel twins satan was with her that morning adam met at you and you see the big fuss in the paper here i believe the tucson now that woman bringing forth a colored child and a white child at the same time she lived with her husband that morning and the man that afternoon and the man would take care of the white man said take care of his own child but the colored man would have to take care of his own see i know that in breeding of dogs and so forth it certainly will if it's in a few hours afterwards this proves now the show where civilization come from now let us read genesis over here uh uh in the fourth chapter of genesis again and see where the 16th verse and cain went out from the presence of god and dwelt in the land of nod on the east side of eden and cain knew his wife and she conceived and very you know and he built a city and called the name of the city after his son enoch civilization started amen dr schofield here in my scofield bible says the first civilization notice then he begot sons and they made organs and music the next one begot sons and he began to do other things wonders build cities and and make uh instruments of brass and all kinds of things see that's what he did become the first civilization which was canaanite he's done the same thing down to the ages now let's get there with the 25th verse and watch what the next was and adam knew his wife again now and she bear a son and call his name saith for god said she has appointed me another seed instead of abel who came through and saith and to say it to him also there was born a son and he called his name enos and then began man to call upon the name of the lord out of the south side not the canaanite side see that great intellectual that we all so hold to what's communism today what's their god it's the intellectual science what are we doing anyhow why are we living consider these words today now he has his kind of an eden satan does now and these six thousand years he has farmed not created but deformed god's whole earth is creatures the animals interbreeding high breeding trees plants human even to religion the bible church until he's got himself a complete garden of eden of science everything moving by science automobiles everything that we have was given to us by science what man has done and he's got his great eden here to prove the message is timely to prove that it's not some other age but revelations 10. look at the high breeding today to make a better or prettier not a better look a little children today now i tell you as we listen to the first part of that brother branham he's laying out his scriptures he's laying out as he's going into the subject but he preached so much doctrine right there in those few pages we read if you if you catch what brother i'm saying we have because we've been looking at this he explained the entire problem in just i mean the first few minutes there he was giving a testimony and we left that on there you know a lot of times we'll cut into a message after we get through some of those comments but he'll he he refers back to that so i left that in there but but here in about 30 minutes he lays out the entire problem he explained what when what was started how it was started right how it went wrong and where we're at today all in 30 minutes and he preached so much doctrine laying in there every line had so much meat into it but we're going to go through our questions now and just pull out some of these things as we move on the first question i asked was what is the bible and so if we'll go with me to paragraph 36 sorry 30 no 34. it said many times man said well now man wrote the bible no the bible says itself that god wrote the bible it's the word of god so the bible is the word of god and then i want to go up to paragraph 33 and get some more details it's an old familiar text that many of your pastors have used down through your time it's been used since it was written but yet one thing about the word of god it never grows old because it's god the word of god is god amen and and it's just so important because what brother brown was going to get into is the word of god established everything but it was the perversion or the leaving word of god that brought leaving the word of god brought death to everything because god is life his word is life and light because god let's read that again it never grows old because it's god it never grows old though every generation now for pretty near about 2 800 years or better this word of god has been read by men priests and so forth and never does it grow old i've been reading it myself for some 35 years and each time i read it i find something new that i looked over the first time because it's inspired it's god in letter form that's what our bible is god in letter form and it's the attributes of god speaking forth and it's placed on paper amen that's why brother branham brought everything back to the bible we already read verse 34 many times man said well now man wrote this bible no the bible says itself that god wrote the bible it's the word of god paragraph 35 and it never can fail see heavens and earth will fail pass away but my word shall never fail and it cannot fail being god because it's part of him paragraph 36 and then you being a son and daughter you are part of it and that makes you part of him so that's why we can come fellowship together around the word because we are part of the word amen this bible is god amen in written form in it's the word of god amen which is god now it's god in written form and now if you're part of god then you're in the bible and you're part of him you're part of this word and it all ties together amen i love the way brother bram says that matter of fact i mean there's no there's no wiggle room he just says it he says it so many times he said it and we get used to hearing it but when you really catch what he's saying and what it means for you personally he brought you right into this as part of that amen so it's very profound what he's saying and it's actually very astonishing what he's saying and i wonder how many people there that day actually agreed with what he was saying they were probably nodding their head and saying amen but do you really do we really understand what he's saying all right the next question what does the word transform mean let's look together at paragraph 37 now this word transformed i looked it up in the dictionary yesterday when i i almost lost track of the time that i was to be here when i was looking for a text i found this word or this text brother scripture and then the dictionary says that it's something that's changed it's to be changed transformed made different than what it is it's been its character and everything has been changed in it to transform let's look at paragraph 38 and i think this morning in genesis 1 this world was without form and was void and darkness was upon the earth nothing but a complete chaos and when this world was in that condition the spirit of god moved upon the face of the water and the entire picture was changed from total chaos to a garden of eden that is transforming power of god that can take something that's nothing and make something wonderful out of it god's transforming power so brother venom is pointing back to creation to show god's transforming power that when you look in genesis 1 2 amen it was total chaos water covered the face of the deep you couldn't see anything that was in the mind of god you couldn't and brother banham tells us that under the water there were seeds amen and those seeds were first formed by the word of god before they came into a natural form so the natural form contained the word of god all right so the word of god was lacked locked in the natural form of that seed and that seed was down below the water amen and so it was going to take something to take this chaos and transform this chaos into a beautiful eden it was going to take god's power of transformation and that's what brother ben was speaking about through this whole message that it's going to take god's power of transformation so what brought the transformation amen the spirit of god begin to move on the waters because the spirit now is going to come upon the word and bring the word into effect and bring the word to life and as it begins to bring the word of life it begins to quicken the seed that's there and there's a word in the seed and when the word and the seed comes to manifestation it's the power of transformation is already in the seed amen the reason brother ben's teaching this is so that you and i will understand what's in us so the spirit of god moved amen to bring the conditions right so that the light will strike the seed so it will quicken what's in the seed so that seed and the natural will produce what the word spoke of it was spoken to be in the beginning and now as it begins to produce and begins to produce as the spirit broods over and it brings the spoken word of god into manifestation this whole world was transformed from total chaos to a garden of eden by the spoken word that was trapped in the seed and the spirit of god brooding over that bringing it into a beautiful transformation our lives were chaos but the spirit of god brooded over us brought the word to us and the word came to the word that was in us and we didn't just all of a sudden become a man a magnificent creature or a son or daughter of god amen we were already spoken sons and daughters of god it was already god's word and that word was placed into us as a seed and it was laying there when you saw the seed you didn't see necessarily the palm tree you saw the seed amen but when the spirit of god moved over it it took what was already in the seed and brought it to the manifestation of god's thought and that's what god is doing with you and i in this day that's the heart of this message amen let's go to the fourth question i'm sorry third question thank you what is the channel that every seed must stay in let's go to paragraph 64 together on page 9. in everything under control to bring forth of its kind now remember to bring when he put the seed in the earth the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was his transforming power now god put the seed in there with potentials that it would be what he said it would be and as long as it stayed in its right category it would be just exactly what god said it would be it had to be that way because he had made it that way and made a channel that anything that stays in his channel in his line of word that's the channel in his line of word it will have to bring forth exactly like his word said it would do it cannot move from that it's channeled just exactly right so with everything in the trust he had in his own son that it would be that way then god said it's all good so all just rest and each one of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the species that i desire it to be that's what it must be because i've given every seed transforming power to make out of itself in its potentials now to make out of itself exactly what i want it to be god has never changed just the same today as he was then so i i want to catch this really catch it and drive it home that last sentence in paragraph 64 on page 9 and each one of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the specie that i desire to be because the seed that's in us has part of god on the inside as the life of god it's part of the word of god which is part of the thought of god of what god wanted that seed to be and what he wanted that seed in you to express amen and if the spirit of god will move over that seed and quicken it the life it'll begin to grow and as it begins to grow in you it begins to transform amen from a fallen creature into a redeemed son of god and it's moving into the likeness of christ to the thought that god had of you before the foundation of the world to express a certain part of the thought of god and the only thing that you have to do amen is trust amen in the word of god that's given to us and what god put inside of you because it's part of himself to be expressed in this day and there's a power there to express exactly what god wanted before the foundation of the world but we have to stay in the channel of the word and if we stay in the channel of the word god has already put it down inside of you to manifest all that he wants you to manifest it's not about running around and trying to produce something and i should be this and i should do that and i should manifest this gift and i should manifest that gift whatever you're going to manifest he already put inside of you before the foundation of the world there's a portion that's you a portion of the seed of the life if he spoke palm tree a palm tree would be a palm tree if he spoke oh it would be an oak it would manifest what that thought was and whatever god once manifest in your life he has already put inside of you amen so it's not about us trying to manifest something about something it's about staying in the channel of the word and having faith that whatever he put in me if i stay in the channel of the world it'll come to life amen because it's god it's the power of transformation where is that power in the seed it's already in you so we don't have to worry about becoming something stay in the channel of the word it'll happen stay in line with this word that's been restored amen it's stripped away the perversion to bring us back in line if we stay in line with the word it will produce this seed will produce what he predestinated for it to produce in this age and you don't have to worry about it manufacture it produce it stay in the channel of the word the life that's already in there will come out under the anointing of the holy ghost and channel with the true word and you will be all that he called you to be amen that way we're not chasing after things that are not even for us let's go back and i want to read two more places here let's go back to paragraph 61 on page 9. the channel is the line of the word and he said here in paragraph 61 on page 9 and he had spoke the word and his great creating power had formed these things that come up and even the man and the woman and they were the head because they were super to all other races and he put them also under a care of the same thing that he put trees animals and so forth his word they must never by no means break that word they must stay there don't ever take away from it or add anything to it you must live by the word paragraph 62 and as long as they create that creation would have existed like that sister chicarian wouldn't have had to have went this morning as long as it would have stayed like them god's great economy is what we believe that we are heading back to we are going back to that spot to that place we are going back to the channel of god's word coming back in perfect line to bring us all the way back to eden amen and listen the power of transformation is already in the seed the power to be translated in your atoms to be changed is already in the seed just stay in the channel of the word we don't have to work anything up pump anything up pull anything down just stay in the channel of the word it'll produce everything that it's supposed to produce amen all right question number four what power does the enemy have let's go to paragraph 66 on page 10. paragraph 66 on page 10. now after it's all so well and set in order god felt sure now that this would all be all right and then when he did then came the enemy i'm going to god gave power to transform and i'm going to call this fellow with power not to create again but he had power to deform not transform but to deform now anything deformed is taken from its original state there is something that's gone wrong with it so he had the power to deform that's that's what satan did the devil he had power to deform let's go down to paragraph 70 at the bottom here the deformer i know this seems to be rather strange to speak of it in this way to deform but that's what he was he deformed or perverted pervert means to be changed over made something different and deform is the same thing it's been brought over and deformed and made in another way yet it's still the same seed but it's deformed now let's go back and look at paragraph 43 43 and god is the fountain of all grace and power and of all divine wisdom is in god so therefore knowing that he is the only creator there is there is no other creator but god satan cannot create it all he only perverts what's been created but god is the only creator so because satan because satan has his own agenda he has his own plan satan cannot create any material to work with so he can only take the material that god created and deform it or pervert it into another purpose amen and when he can get when he could get the children of god to leave the channel of the word all of a sudden they became deformed and all creation became deformed and that was his power because he can't create or make anything he can only take what god made and deform it he can't bring his own word he takes god's word and he deforms it he can't bring his own creation he takes god's creation and deforms it so he perverts or deforms so that is his job that is his power to deform so satan loses all of his power when we refuse to leave the word he the only power he has is the power to deform he cannot create amen he cannot he cannot overpower god's word god could satan could never come in the garden of eden and overpower god's word he could only get god's children to leave the word or deviate from the word and that's how he expressed his power to deform but satan could not do that they had to do that he influenced them he deceived them he tricked them but they're the ones who had to leave the word so so satan is not going to come in amen to us and all of a sudden twist us into knots and deform us we will do that of our own choice if we're deceived into leaving the channel of the word then we become perverted or deformed so what is the solution where is our safety amen what will keep us the line of the word the channel of the word that's why it's so important that the word was restored to us in this day taking his power away to deform the bride to deform the church the next question question five and what does he do with it what does he do with the power to deform let's look at paragraph 71 at the top of page 11. paragraph 71 now we find that this deformer has always had the same amount of time to deform has also had the same amount of time to deform as god had to transform now he planted his seed or he never planted his seed in the garden of eden since that time he has had six thousand years of deforming the seed of god and the word of god to deform it make it something different from the first time that eve listened to him and got herself just one little phrase let's go to paragraph 76 now civilization is of the devil it's just got i just got through preaching on that all culture and the earth all powers of science and everything is of the devil it's his gospel he preached of knowledge in the garden of eden and he has took that knowledge perverted knowledge contrary to the word and will and plan of god and now he has had 6 000 years to do just exactly what god did only in a perverted way and took the same amount of time to bring his own eden in now he has got an eden here on earth and it's filled with wisdom knowledge that was his gospel at the beginning knowledge wisdom science never did god ever cater to such and i want you to watch a minute he did this and because that he was a man of worldly wisdom so what has he done he's taken god took 6 000 years to transform by the power of transformation a chaos into a garden of eden and satan has taken six thousand years to deform from the garden of eden and to his eden satan's eden which i would say is another chaos let's go to paragraph 91 now he has his kind of eden satan does now and in these six thousand years he has formed not created but deformed god's whole earth his creatures the animals interbreeding hybriding trees plants human even to religion the bible church until he has got himself a complete garden of eden of science everything moving by science our automobiles everything that we have we've given to us by science what man has done and he has got his great eden here to prove the message is timely to prove that it's not some other age but revelation 10. god is the one who puts the parameters on time god is the one who took six thousand years for the power of transformation to bring a garden of eden and god has allowed another six thousand years to transpire and in that six thousand years satan under the power of deforming the power to deform has made his own eden but brother banham said he's done that to prove he has got his great eaten here to prove the message is timely to prove that it's not some other age but revelation 10. god has given a space of time for for uh satan to come to the fullness of his plan to the fullness of creating his eden amen and at that fullness it's only going to declare how true the word of god is amen it's only going to declare that it's time for revelation 10. nothing's out of kilter nothing's beyond god's plan he's had 6 thousand years of deform but god knew all along he was going gonna have six thousand years he's had six thousand years to move people away from the word of god and twist it and deform it and deform society to form culture deform everything until he has his perfect eden and that's just what god was going to give him space of time to do so that in satan's eden god can come along and strike the final death blow to bring us back to the word to reverse everything that he's been working for 6 thousand years to create it's just proving god so there's nothing to worry about now i just want to make one more note that was our last question but one more note in paragraph 79 he says now and now he promised that the mysteries that was hid in those all those church ages would be revealed right at the end time and he lets us kno he lets us know now we are at the end time we're here now that was 1965. he says this signifies that we're at the end time that's when he would reveal and satan's eating he would reveal all the mysteries it marks the end time where at the end time we're here now and i would say we must be at the end of the end time that marked the end time my brothers and sisters we must be at the end of the end time amen god bless you let's all stand together musicians if you can make your way up all right i just wanted to remind everybody of the new books that came in on the book rack and all the books that are in the library one of the things that i really desired in getting these books and keeping them in inventory is that everybody who wants can have a library of their own every child in the church everybody if you're if you're a child and you're growing up and you have an interest in the books you're 10 11 12 8 9 10. it doesn't matter if you want the bookstore out there and like i love going into my children's room and i see all their books lined up and they all have their own library of of the message you know i know we have all kinds of electronic devices we have it on cell phones and we have it on tablets and we have it on that but you can grab your cell phone and you can get distracted from reading the message and do all kinds of other stuff you can be reading the message and your buzzer could go off and you go off to your message or to a text and read that but when you pick up a book and sit down this is the only thing you're doing with this book is reading the message so you don't have to get the message from books i'm not saying that but for me i really like taking a book taking my pocket full of highlighters and sitting down and going through that book and so i just want everybody who wants one to have a chance to have your own library every child every teenager everybody you can have your own book library and we're going to order more books we've been ordering once a year but i think i'm going to step that up because i know that the books will eventually be depleted so i'm going to start trying maybe twice a year to get new books in so we'll let you know when they come in but right now every child in this church can have an exposition of the seven church ages can have the seven seals and have 40 individual booklets if power goes out for 72 hours you still have the word you can't recharge your device but there's no excuse you still have the word amen and so you never know with the way the world goes and all the crises that are around you have no idea that the power is going to stay on indefinitely but you can always go over to your bookshelf and pull off a book and open it up and say i'm not going to text message right now i'm not going to answer an email i'm not going to call mom or dad or aunt this or uncle that i'm going to sit down with this book and i'm going to receive what god gave me in this age from this book so that's part of the reason that we've done what we've done over the years is so everybody can have their own library so take advantage of it it's there don't take it for granted i love seeing young people read the message i love it i love seeing them with the message book i love looking over the shoulder and seeing little marks in the book it does something it thrills in my soul because if you can learn to feed from what god gave us in this day amen coming to church will mean so much more sunday and wednesday is not enough word to survive on in satan's eden we need the word on a daily basis and god's given us such a rich treasure of the word amen if you if you get into those books and get into those tapes i promise you sunday and wednesday
