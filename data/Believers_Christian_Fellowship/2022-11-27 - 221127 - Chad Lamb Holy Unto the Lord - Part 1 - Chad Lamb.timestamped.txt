[10:03] your goodness of your grace Of Your Love
[10:07] all just the ability to express our love
[10:10] to you Lord is such a tremendous
[10:12] blessing and God now as we come Lord to
[10:16] the time where we take this word and
[10:18] begin to read it Lord we know we need
[10:21] more than the ability to read we need
[10:24] more than intellect we need more than
[10:25] the mind of a man but we need you to
[10:27] come on the scene Lord
[10:29] we're depending on you we've come to
[10:31] commune with you Lord to worship you to
[10:34] Bow before you to surrender to your word
[10:36] I pray God you would come and take this
[10:39] vessel of clay and take it into your own
[10:41] hand Lord and use it for your purpose to
[10:44] break the Word of Life to your waiting
[10:46] children God may we feed from you today

[10:56] edified where we love you Lord have
[10:58] preeminence among us we pray in Jesus
[11:01] Christ's name amen
[11:04] and while we're standing let's just read
[11:06] a scripture out of First Peter chapter
[11:09] one
[11:10] also uh it gives me a great pleasure to
[11:13] say that we'll be having a baptism today
[11:15] at the end of service our brother Alan
[11:18] and sister Tammy Reisner desire to be
[11:20] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[11:22] Christ so we have a double baptism a
[11:24] husband and wife together and I think
[11:26] that's a tremendous thing so I'm looking
[11:28] forward to that consider it a tremendous
[11:30] blessing just to be able to be part of
[11:32] that
[11:33] also I want to uh just thank everybody
[11:36] who helped with the meetings this last
[11:38] weekend it was wonderful I so
[11:40] appreciated the word I appreciated the
[11:42] fellowship I was really really blessed
[11:45] by it so I thank God for everybody who
[11:47] contributed and did their part brother
[11:49] Alistair is home safe he let me know he
[11:51] got back home so appreciate your prayers
[11:53] brother Daniel white and his family will
[11:55] be a true word Tabernacle this morning
[11:57] brother Daniel's taking the morning
[11:58] service then they'll be heading to
[12:00] Detroit tonight and they're flying out
[12:02] early in the morning so remember them in
[12:05] prayer as they travel home but they all
[12:07] had a wonderful time they all commented
[12:09] on how kind you all were and how loving
[12:11] and how they felt at home and that did
[12:14] my heart a lot of good as well so God
[12:16] bless you all and thank you for that man
[12:19] I was I was greatly edified and fed by
[12:22] the word this past weekend and it was a
[12:25] great encouragement to all of us I
[12:27] believe
[12:28] but now let's let's look into the word
[12:31] here first Peter chapter 1 verse 13.
[12:38] first Peter
[12:39] 1
[12:40] and 13. submit yourselves to every
[12:43] ordinary ordinance of man for the Lord's
[12:45] sake
[12:46] whether it be no I'm in the wrong spot
[12:49] I'm in second I'm sorry First Peter
[12:51] chapter 1 verse 13. wherefore gird up
[12:54] the loins of your mind be sober and hope
[12:57] to the end for the grace that is to be
[12:58] brought unto you at the revelation of
[13:00] Jesus Christ as obedient children not
[13:03] fashioning yourselves according to the
[13:04] former lust in your ignorance but as he
[13:07] which hath called you is Holy so be holy
[13:10] in all manner of conversation
[13:14] because it is written be you holy for I
[13:18] am Holy God bless you as you take your
[13:21] seeds amen
[13:23] so I was reading out of chapter 2 verse
[13:25] 13 I said chapter one over and over and
[13:28] it's never as as fun for me as
[13:30] interesting as for when brother Branham
[13:31] gets the wrong scripture because it's
[13:33] the word opening in a major way me it's
[13:35] just a man who can't find the right
[13:36] chapter
[13:38] but anyways God is good to us and I
[13:40] wanted to look at this scripture here as
[13:42] a as a springboard to launch into the
[13:44] subject of holy unto the Lord I want to
[13:47] take for a subject holy unto the Lord
[13:49] and I want to look at some scriptures
[13:51] and talk about this and one of the main
[13:54] reasons is God dropped us in my heart
[13:55] this just title holy unto the Lord and
[13:57] and meditating on it I realize that so
[14:00] often we have a wrong understanding of
[14:03] what it means to be holy we have a wrong
[14:06] understanding of Holiness I find so many
[14:07] times Within Myself and I don't know
[14:09] about you but I can speak for myself
[14:11] that sometimes I come up with a Nazarene
[14:13] idea of Holiness or I come with a you
[14:16] know a previous Church age idea of
[14:18] Holiness and I haven't really caught the
[14:20] concept that God's bringing of what it
[14:23] means to be holy it's not necessarily
[14:25] what I've always thought it to be I'd
[14:29] like to go back and look at this in the
[14:30] Old Testament if you can go with me to
[14:32] Leviticus
[14:34] and we're going to go to quite a number
[14:36] of scriptures today
[14:38] but if you could keep your Bibles handy
[14:40] we'll go to Leviticus and begin looking
[14:43] at this subject
[14:47] so Peter commends us to be holy
[14:51] to be holy in all manner of conversation
[14:53] conversation is the way you live it's
[14:55] not just talking to another person but
[14:57] in the Bible this word conversation
[14:59] means your lifestyle or the way you live
[15:01] and we're to be holy in all men of
[15:03] conversation because it is written be
[15:06] holy for I am Holy because God is Holy
[15:09] he's called us to be holy and so when we
[15:12] look at this in comparison we begin to
[15:14] think because God is Holy I must be holy
[15:17] then then somehow my my idea of being
[15:21] holy or Holiness is some level of
[15:24] perfection where there's never a fault
[15:26] in me anymore
[15:27] that I'd never make a mistake that I've
[15:30] come to sinless Perfection and when I
[15:32] get to this point where I'm never I have
[15:34] no more fault then I'll be holy but that
[15:36] is not the Bible definition of what it
[15:39] means to be holy and so I want to look
[15:41] into the scripture when God says be holy
[15:44] or call something holy what is God
[15:46] talking about because I don't want to
[15:48] get an old Methodist idea or a Nazarene
[15:51] idea or a Pentecostal idea of Holiness
[15:54] and when we talk about Holiness
[15:55] sometimes our mind goes Amen to long
[15:58] hair and long dresses and that old
[16:00] Holiness Pentecostal that came in from
[16:02] the nazarenes amen and that's not
[16:04] necessarily the definition of holiness
[16:08] amen you you could you could uh you
[16:12] could be dressed perfectly modest and in
[16:15] every way your attire can be pleasing to
[16:18] what God desires for a woman or a man to
[16:20] dress and you can still not be holy
[16:24] so it's not just when we say Holiness we
[16:26] got I want to break myself away from the
[16:29] pilgrim Holiness Church I Want to Break
[16:31] myself away from the nazarenes and from
[16:33] the Methodist and from the Pentecostal
[16:35] Holiness and I want to know when God
[16:37] calls something holy what does he mean
[16:39] by that when he tells us to be holy what
[16:41] does he mean by that because if not we
[16:44] find ourselves going back into a Works
[16:46] program where we must be holy by doing a
[16:50] lot of good things to be holy and we can
[16:52] do a lot of good things and not be
[16:54] anyways in any way holy at all
[16:58] we can act right talked right dressed
[17:00] right and not even be close to being
[17:02] holy
[17:03] so what does it mean to be holy let's
[17:05] look at Leviticus chapter 20 verse 5.
[17:13] it says then I will set my face against
[17:17] that man and against his family and I
[17:20] will cut him off all that goal of
[17:22] whoring after him to commit whoredom
[17:24] with Molech from among their people and
[17:27] the soul that turneth after such is have
[17:29] familiar spirits and after Wizards do go
[17:32] a whoring after them I will even set my
[17:34] face against that soul and will cut him
[17:37] off from among his people
[17:39] sanctify yourselves therefore and be
[17:41] holy for I am the Lord your God
[17:45] and ye shall keep my statutes and do
[17:48] them I am the Lord which sanctify you
[17:51] so there's a couple words here that I
[17:53] want to look at the word sanctify
[17:55] yourselves and I am the Lord that
[17:57] sanctify you and be holy and I want to
[18:00] look at what what this means and what
[18:02] the Lord's referring to so if we look at
[18:04] the word sanctify the word sanctifying
[18:07] the word holy in this in these uh last
[18:11] two verses verse 7 and verse 8 are very
[18:14] similar words they're very close to one
[18:16] another with similar meanings so the
[18:19] word uh the word sanctify means to
[18:22] consecrate
[18:24] to sanctify prepare to dedicate to be
[18:27] hallowed to be holy to be Sanctified or
[18:31] be separate
[18:33] the word holy means something that's
[18:35] sacred or holy or a saint or something
[18:39] that's set apart
[18:40] and so we'll find brother Frank if you
[18:42] could bring up the Whiteboard I think
[18:44] I'm going to use that a little bit this
[18:45] morning we find I I want to
[18:49] um I want us to have I I myself want to
[18:52] have an understanding of this so I don't
[18:54] if I slip back into that legalistic mode
[18:57] of being holy
[18:58] then I'm going to find myself really
[19:01] frustrated
[19:03] and when I have when I have to be holy
[19:06] by keeping a code then I'm going to find
[19:10] myself always short of Holiness and and
[19:13] it becomes an unattainable goal
[19:16] uh I've used the analogy before the it's
[19:18] the carrot on the stick but somebody in
[19:20] my family told me that half the people
[19:22] probably don't have a clue what I'm
[19:23] talking about especially young people
[19:25] and I'm realizing that I still consider
[19:28] myself really young
[19:30] but I did have a rotary dial phone when
[19:33] I was a kid
[19:34] and I lost half the crowd
[19:40] when we talk about the the carrot on the
[19:42] stick amen it's the old thing if you
[19:44] have a donkey and you're sitting on your
[19:45] donkey and you can't get the donkey to
[19:47] move forward and you whip him in the
[19:48] back he's not going amen some clever kid
[19:51] found out one day if I just take a stick
[19:53] and I tie a carrot on it and I hold it
[19:54] out in front of the donkey the donkey
[19:56] walks towards the carrot
[19:58] get him to move
[20:00] amen that's great to get a donkey to
[20:03] move amen but but eventually the
[20:05] donkey's going to realize I have never
[20:07] eaten that carrots
[20:09] this is an unattainable goal and
[20:12] sometimes we we the ideas that we have
[20:14] are unattainable goals the concepts that
[20:16] come down by tradition through church
[20:19] ages and and these were these were
[20:21] people's best idea best concept on on
[20:24] teaching the word but we've got the open
[20:25] book in this day that opened up the very
[20:27] nature of God to us Amen to understand
[20:30] God in a way that we're not constantly
[20:33] plodding along after an unattainable
[20:35] goal amen and we're not we're not moving
[20:38] and being motivated by trying to gain to
[20:41] this thing that we're never going to
[20:42] gain on our own with our own efforts
[20:44] it's an absolute impossibility all we do
[20:47] is is move move but we never get there
[20:49] amen and I don't want I don't want to
[20:52] become tired in my service to God I want
[20:55] to be joyful and vibrant and exuberant
[20:57] in my service to the Lord
[20:59] I don't want that old tired feeling of
[21:02] I'm never going to get there I'm never
[21:04] going to arrive I'm never going to make
[21:06] it I'm never going to be good enough I'm
[21:08] never never never and and it's it's this
[21:10] constant motivation to do better and we
[21:13] do good for a couple days and then we
[21:14] found we go right back to the starting
[21:16] point and got to start all over again
[21:18] that is not how God leads his people
[21:20] that is not God how God has instructed
[21:22] his people
[21:24] amen so I I want to I want to understand
[21:27] these things in a different light
[21:31] so
[21:33] I'm going to write on this board here
[21:35] and I want to look at a couple terms
[21:43] first term is Holy
[21:45] now in the Bible we look at English
[21:49] words in English words trying to become
[21:53] a definition for what was written
[21:55] originally in Hebrew or in Greek or
[21:58] Aramaic or however it was amen so
[22:00] sometimes words are used interchangeably
[22:03] sometimes we'll see the same English
[22:06] word like sanctify it can be used three
[22:08] or four times but underneath that word
[22:10] is two or three different Greek words
[22:12] that sanctify as trying to fulfill love
[22:14] is one for instance love can mean a a a
[22:17] familiar feeling love for a friend or
[22:20] agape love which is perfect love the
[22:22] love of God Amen and it's the same
[22:24] English word but there's actually two
[22:26] concepts laying underneath of that the
[22:28] same thing with the terms holy and
[22:30] sanctify and consecrate amen sometimes
[22:33] you can use the same English word but
[22:35] it's being used in place of two
[22:37] different Hebrew words two different
[22:39] Greek words amen just trying to
[22:41] understand but when you go and look back
[22:43] at what God's saying and what the
[22:45] prophet has taught us we begin to
[22:46] understand what it is God wants from his
[22:49] people what is it that God is looking
[22:51] for what is it he's instructing Us in so
[22:54] when we look at the word holy
[22:58] we can we can say that which is sacred
[23:04] or set apart
[23:09] now I'm trying just to keep things
[23:12] simple I mean we could go into a word
[23:14] study and go for hours and talk about
[23:16] the nuances and I would be the only one
[23:19] having fun this morning
[23:21] I'm trying not to make a simple subject
[23:24] complicated I just want to keep a simple
[23:26] subject simple
[23:28] because what I'm trying my best to do I
[23:30] find sometimes that I can make things
[23:32] that should be simple complicated and
[23:35] I'm not trying to do that
[23:37] so to sanctify
[23:41] to sanctify or be Sanctified or
[23:45] sanctifying all of these versions of
[23:48] sanctify if we could just look at it
[23:50] this way
[23:52] it means
[23:54] to separate
[24:00] separate
[24:04] to be
[24:08] separate
[24:12] or
[24:13] to consecrate
[24:21] when some of these terms are used
[24:25] we can talk about something that's holy
[24:27] when we talk about something that's holy
[24:29] in the Bible we're talking about
[24:30] something that is sacred it's sacred in
[24:33] itself it is a sacred thing it is
[24:36] something that is set apart it's
[24:38] designated differently it's it's it's
[24:40] sacred it's set apart when we talk about
[24:43] sanctify it can be the to separate the
[24:47] act of separating the thing that will be
[24:49] holy or or it can be to be separate it
[24:52] could be both it could mean either that
[24:55] which is being separated or that which
[24:57] is already separate
[24:59] and that's what can be confusing about
[25:01] this so is Holiness the act of being
[25:03] separate or is Holiness being separate
[25:05] amen and I would say it's both amen it's
[25:08] the act of being separate and it's it's
[25:10] also already separate
[25:13] we'll get into this you'll understand it
[25:15] better or it means to consecrate there's
[25:17] a we consecrate and dedicate this we
[25:19] have consecrated this Sanctuary to the
[25:22] worship of God
[25:23] we don't do other things in here this is
[25:25] consecrated to the worship of God this
[25:28] place is set apart set aside it is Holy
[25:33] the chairs aren't holy the carpet isn't
[25:36] holy the the desk isn't holy the air
[25:38] conditioning holy the drywall's not holy
[25:40] the paint's not holy in itself it is not
[25:43] sacred and that it has sacred properties
[25:46] in itself but when you say holy ghost
[25:48] the Holy Ghost is sacred in itself right
[25:51] so when I say the Holy Ghost when I say
[25:53] the holy God when I say the Holy One
[25:55] it's holy in itself it is Holy it is
[25:59] sacred if its own property it's sacred
[26:03] but when I say this is now a holy
[26:05] Sanctuary this is set apart and
[26:07] consecrated and dedicated for the
[26:09] worship of God it's Holy by designation
[26:12] because it's been set apart for a holy
[26:14] purpose
[26:16] all right we're starting to understand
[26:19] and the act of consecrating this place
[26:22] putting doors up putting seats in
[26:24] keeping everybody out setting guidelines
[26:26] we don't do this in here we don't do
[26:28] that amen that is the act of sanctifying
[26:31] or hollowing this place
[26:34] so when we don't run when we don't talk
[26:37] when the deacons watch the doors when we
[26:39] make sure that there's no there's
[26:40] nothing going on in here that's
[26:41] inappropriate we are sanctifying this
[26:44] place
[26:46] keeping it holy
[26:48] does that make sense
[26:50] all right because all of these terms we
[26:52] can throw out a lot of terms and then
[26:54] get confused Sanctified to be Sanctified
[26:56] holy Holiness but really that there's
[26:59] there's there's a holy thing that is set
[27:02] apart amen and considered sacred and
[27:05] holy there's also holy things that are
[27:07] Sacred by their own properties
[27:09] the holy God the Holy Ghost the holy
[27:12] word it's sacred in itself some things
[27:15] are sacred because we set it apart to be
[27:17] used for sacred purposes
[27:20] then the act of setting that apart the
[27:23] act of keeping it separated is
[27:25] sanctifying or sanctified
[27:28] we've got that
[27:29] all right so let's let's let's do a
[27:33] little reading all right
[27:35] so we read in Leviticus chapter 20. that
[27:40] he says sanctify yourselves
[27:43] so let's look at this again Leviticus
[27:45] chapter 20 verse 7.
[27:48] sanctify yourselves therefore and be you
[27:51] holy for I am the Lord your God
[27:54] sanctify yourselves that means separate
[27:57] yourselves
[27:59] sanctify yourselves as not necessarily
[28:01] clean yourself up and make yourself
[28:03] perfect but sanctify yourself as
[28:05] separate yourself and designate yourself
[28:08] to God
[28:10] that means that separation from the
[28:12] world Amen so so whenever we obey the
[28:15] word of God because God's word is Holy
[28:18] whenever we come in obedience to the
[28:20] word of God Amen we are separating
[28:22] ourselves from something amen if God
[28:25] gives an idea or a concept about
[28:27] something whether it's the way we should
[28:30] conduct ourselves the way we should
[28:31] dress or who we should marry or who we
[28:33] should not marry if we get into that and
[28:35] God designates in his word amen then
[28:39] when we make the choice to obey the word
[28:42] we are now sanctifying ourselves are
[28:45] setting ourselves apart from the wrong
[28:47] idea and aligning to the right idea
[28:49] which is God's holy word and we have
[28:51] Sanctified ourselves
[28:54] we haven't purified ourselves we can't
[28:57] purify ourselves but we consecrate
[29:00] ourselves and set ourselves aside to the
[29:02] word of God we've come we've separated
[29:05] to the word separated from the world
[29:08] you say well we're either in the world
[29:10] or we're separated from the world I
[29:12] would say it this way we are separating
[29:15] from the world Choice by choice thought
[29:18] by thought obedience by obedience
[29:20] command by command we are separating
[29:23] from the world and maintaining our
[29:26] Separation by the choices that we make
[29:29] just like we keep this place consecrated
[29:32] and Sanctified for the use we keep it
[29:35] hallowed and holy for the purpose of
[29:38] worshiping God we have to keep it
[29:40] sanctified
[29:43] and so he says sanctify yourselves
[29:46] therefore and be ye holy which means to
[29:49] be you sacred or set apart
[29:52] so separate yourselves and be separate
[29:58] for I am the Lord your God and you shall
[30:00] keep my statutes and do them I I am the
[30:04] Lord which sanctify you
[30:06] so now do we sanctify ourselves or does
[30:09] God sanctify us
[30:12] the answer is amen
[30:14] we are we are to separate from the
[30:17] world's idea and take God's word amen we
[30:21] sanctify ourselves to obey his word amen
[30:23] but but God is the one who sanctifies us
[30:26] because unless he separates us out we'll
[30:29] never be separated unless he calls us
[30:31] unless he designates us we will never be
[30:34] a separated people we can never be a
[30:36] holy people unless he sanctifies us
[30:40] but he says sanctify yourselves and be
[30:42] holy
[30:43] how can I be holy if my if I have to be
[30:47] sinlessly perfect with no flaw in order
[30:50] to be holy how can I be holy no I am
[30:53] separating myself and I am staying
[30:56] connected with God so I'm sanctifying
[30:58] myself and being holy because he
[31:01] Sanctified me
[31:04] praise God
[31:06] it is it is very much has to do with
[31:09] positioning
[31:11] if we can see that I think it would help
[31:14] let's go to Second Chronicles 35.
[31:22] second chronicles
[31:31] second chronicles 35 and verse 3.
[31:36] now when I go through this I'm going to
[31:38] be talking about uh legalism I'm talking
[31:41] about old-fashioned Holiness ideas and
[31:44] all that and I don't want one person in
[31:46] here to get the wrong idea because when
[31:48] it comes to my personal conduct and what
[31:51] I believe amen I am very tight
[31:55] because I believe what God Said God
[31:59] meant and I believe what the prophet
[32:00] taught is exactly what God wants for us
[32:03] so the standard that we preach will
[32:05] never change amen but the what I'm
[32:07] trying to point out is keeping a
[32:09] standard is not make you holy
[32:13] legalism can never make you holy so just
[32:16] because I have preached against one
[32:17] thing doesn't mean I've changed my mind
[32:19] my I in fact the closer I get to God the
[32:23] tighter that standard becomes for me
[32:24] amen because of what God's doing in my
[32:27] life as I separate and the more that I
[32:30] separate the more I see what was there
[32:34] so at some point there's the the world
[32:36] has influence over us and and you
[32:38] there's certain things we just don't see
[32:40] that's why we have to be patient with
[32:42] new Believers amen we have to be patient
[32:44] with our teenagers sometimes is because
[32:46] new Believers just don't see it takes
[32:49] separation sometimes to bring vision
[32:53] and as we obey the word then we see amen
[32:55] and then when we separate we see as
[32:57] Israel separated more and more they
[32:59] begin to see the fallacy of Egypt but
[33:01] early on when they first went into a
[33:03] trial they said let's go back to Egypt
[33:04] it was pretty good there
[33:07] so as we separate more it actually
[33:10] doesn't bring a locksness in our life or
[33:13] a lowering of the standard for me
[33:15] personally what it's done is given me a
[33:17] Clear Vision on why that's wrong what's
[33:19] the spirit behind it why did the prophet
[33:22] teach it and it makes me in my heart
[33:24] have a desire Amen to stay consecrated
[33:27] and stay separated from the world
[33:30] it in no way ever makes me want to say
[33:33] well yeah it doesn't really matter I
[33:35] mean that's not really going to make you
[33:36] holy so this doesn't matter everything
[33:39] matters
[33:41] everything matters
[33:43] if we could understand that everything
[33:46] matters
[33:48] to God
[33:49] what we say what we look at what we hear
[33:52] how we speak how we dress how we carry
[33:56] ourselves the attitudes of our heart
[33:57] everything matters
[34:00] we'll never get to the place where it
[34:01] doesn't matter it matters
[34:03] what I want to do is not chase the wrong
[34:06] thing and try to obtain an unattainable
[34:08] goal
[34:09] I want to find out what God meant by
[34:12] these things
[34:13] and and I want to follow after that
[34:16] so second chronicles 35 and 3.
[34:24] and said unto the Levites that taught
[34:26] all Israel which were holy unto the Lord
[34:29] put the holy Ark and uh unto the Lord
[34:33] put the holy Ark in the house which
[34:34] Sodom and my son David king of Israel
[34:37] did build so I just want the first part
[34:39] of that phrase to catch something and he
[34:41] said unto the Levites that taught all
[34:43] Israel which were holy which were holy
[34:46] unto the Lord
[34:48] the Levites were holy unto the Lord what
[34:51] makes the Levites holy unto the Lord was
[34:54] not that they were born holy
[34:57] as far as sinless and and it's even not
[35:00] that the Levites lived with no flaw
[35:04] do you believe that the Levites uh
[35:06] different than the other 11 tribes that
[35:09] the other 11 tribes constantly had
[35:11] struggles but the Levites didn't have
[35:13] any struggle
[35:14] and the 11 they constantly made mistakes
[35:16] but the Levites because they were holy
[35:18] unto the Lord and told to be holy they
[35:21] never failed they never sinned they
[35:23] never made a mistake they never did
[35:24] anything wrong that's foolish amen what
[35:27] made them holy is God separated them out
[35:30] from the twelve and said you will be
[35:32] priest amen this is your job because
[35:35] they were separated by God they were
[35:37] holy
[35:39] that's what made them holy is their
[35:42] separation not their not necessarily
[35:46] that they were born into a perfect
[35:47] family and had perfect conduct all of
[35:50] their lives amen the Levites failed like
[35:52] every other tribe failed the Levites had
[35:54] sin like every other tribe had sin even
[35:57] God would designate a high priest and
[35:59] that high priest would be be Holiness
[36:01] unto God he would be the most holy of
[36:04] the Levites would be the high priest
[36:06] what made him the most holy is because
[36:08] he was the only one chosen for that
[36:10] office it did not make him sinlessly
[36:13] perfect amen and he did not have to come
[36:16] to sinless Perfection to be the high
[36:18] priest
[36:19] he was high priest because God chose
[36:22] listen Israel was holy because God chose
[36:25] Israel
[36:29] they were set apart from all the other
[36:31] nations
[36:32] that made them a holy nation
[36:35] if you read the history it it was not
[36:38] because they were perfect
[36:39] it was not because they never made a
[36:41] mistake it was not because they got it
[36:43] all right and they've completely
[36:44] understood everything God wanted they
[36:46] failed and failed and failed and failed
[36:48] what made them a holy nation is because
[36:51] God chose them amen he chose Abraham he
[36:54] chose Abraham's seed he called them out
[36:57] amen and called and they were a holy
[36:59] nation because they were separated unto
[37:01] God
[37:02] then out of that Nation he chose one
[37:04] family Levi Amen to Bear the ark to take
[37:08] care of the vessels to be the priest and
[37:10] out of that one family that one tribe he
[37:13] chose one family one man Aaron and his
[37:15] descendants to be the high priest
[37:18] so it was Aaron the most well-behaved of
[37:20] the Levites and the Levites the most
[37:22] well-behaved of the Israelites and the
[37:24] Israelites the most well-behaved of the
[37:25] world
[37:27] the answer is no
[37:29] God chose them and separated them out
[37:32] they chose Levi and separated him out
[37:35] then he chose Aaron and separated him
[37:37] out amen and Aaron was the high priest
[37:39] and this becomes evident because on the
[37:41] day of atonement Aaron as the most holy
[37:44] priest unto God had to put on all the
[37:47] holy garments and go before God and
[37:50] offer an atonement for the nation he was
[37:52] the he was to give a sacrifice that
[37:54] would cover for the sins of all the
[37:56] people and he's the only one that can do
[37:58] it but before he offered that sacrifice
[38:00] he had to offer a sacrifice for himself
[38:03] for his sins and the sins of his family
[38:08] so was the high priest perfect
[38:10] absolutely not or else he would never
[38:12] have to precede the the uh uh sacrifice
[38:16] of atonement for the nation without
[38:18] making a sacrifice for himself it proves
[38:20] that he was not perfect he had to make a
[38:23] sacrifice for himself and for his
[38:25] household then when he was accepted by
[38:28] making this sacrifice then he could make
[38:31] a sacrifice for the whole nation
[38:34] so what made him holy is God chose him
[38:38] and set him apart
[38:41] that's what made him holy
[38:45] without that
[38:47] he had no hope
[38:50] if it wasn't for that he had no hope
[38:54] but God knew
[38:59] let's go to uh
[39:02] Jeremiah chapter 2.
[39:11] Jeremiah chapter 2 and verse 1.
[39:28] in Jeremiah chapter 2 verse 1.
[39:32] it says
[39:34] moreover the word of the Lord came to me
[39:36] saying go and cry in the ears of
[39:38] Jerusalem saying thus saith the Lord I
[39:40] remember Thee the kindness of thy youth
[39:42] the love of thine espousals when thou
[39:45] witnessed after me in the wilderness and
[39:46] the land that was not soon
[39:49] Israel was Holiness unto the Lord
[39:52] and the first fruits of his increase
[39:55] Israel was Holiness unto the Lord how
[39:58] did Israel become Holiness unto the Lord
[40:01] and the Wilderness he goes I remember
[40:03] back when I first brought you out of
[40:05] Egypt when you followed after me in the
[40:07] wilderness and that day Israel was
[40:09] Holiness unto the Lord what did it mean
[40:12] for Israel to be Holiness unto the Lord
[40:14] what it meant was Israel was separated
[40:19] to the Lord
[40:21] that word Holiness that's there is
[40:23] Kurdish and it means a Partners Holiness
[40:26] sacredness separateness so what made
[40:29] them Holiness unto the Lord is that they
[40:31] were separated from Egypt they were
[40:33] separated from All Nations they were
[40:35] drawn into the Wilderness and they were
[40:37] dedicated consecrated separated unto God
[40:40] they were holding us unto the Lord
[40:43] and it I mean you've read the Wilderness
[40:45] Journey right we've read the murmings
[40:47] and the complaints and the backslidings
[40:49] and the turning back and the
[40:50] Disobedience you've read all of that
[40:52] amen so when he says Israel was Holiness
[40:54] unto the Lord it wasn't Israel Pious
[40:57] dressed right looking nice saying amen
[40:59] just right doing everything perfect it
[41:01] was not that way because Israel was
[41:03] murmuring about no bread murmuring about
[41:05] no water blaming Moses and blaming God
[41:08] for no me and saying that we should go
[41:10] back to Egypt and when God gave them
[41:12] bread he said only take this much don't
[41:14] take more they took more and it turned
[41:16] into they disobeyed constantly
[41:19] they murmured they complained but Israel
[41:22] was Holiness unto the Lord
[41:24] because God selected the mountain called
[41:27] them to himself and they were separated
[41:29] people unto him
[41:30] praise God
[41:32] is good let's go back to Exodus chapter
[41:36] 30.
[41:38] we'll read in Exodus for a little bit
[41:46] Exodus chapter 13.
[41:48] first
[41:49] 34.
[41:53] this is the the instructions that
[41:57] God has given Moses
[41:59] in making the special incense that will
[42:02] be burned on the altar of incense
[42:04] so in Chapter 30
[42:07] verse 34 these are in the destructions
[42:09] he gives
[42:11] and the Lord said to Moses take unto
[42:14] these sweet spices
[42:16] stacked in Annika and I don't know what
[42:19] all they are galbonum these sweet spices
[42:21] with pure frankincense of eat shall
[42:23] there be a light way and ye shall and
[42:26] thou shalt make it a perfume a
[42:28] confection after the art of the
[42:29] Apothecary tempered together pure and
[42:32] holy and thou shalt beat some of it very
[42:35] small and put of it before the testimony
[42:37] in the Tabernacle of the congregation
[42:39] where I will meet with thee it shall be
[42:42] unto you most holy and as for the
[42:45] perfume which Thou shalt make ye shall
[42:48] not make to yourselves according to the
[42:50] composition thereof it shall be unto
[42:52] thee holy for the Lord
[42:55] so he calls this perfume holy
[42:59] holy it is it is Holy for the Lord amen
[43:03] and this is such an interesting uh
[43:05] statement he says make it he gives them
[43:07] he gives the recipe amen add so much of
[43:10] this and so much of this beat it small
[43:11] and burn it there you shall not make
[43:14] like this to burn in your homes this is
[43:17] Holy of the Lord which means you can't
[43:20] you can't use it for any other purpose
[43:23] you can't use it in any other way amen
[43:25] it didn't make the spices come down from
[43:28] heaven amen it did not make them sacred
[43:31] or holy in themselves they didn't have
[43:34] Holiness in themselves frankincense
[43:37] isn't holy in itself amen murder is not
[43:40] holy in itself these are spices anybody
[43:42] can pick up and use in something else I
[43:44] mean they can use it and whatever they
[43:46] use it they can spice up a chicken I
[43:48] don't know what they would use it for
[43:49] it's not holy and sacred in itself it's
[43:53] holy and sacred in its purpose
[43:57] so so when I say the Holy Ghost it's
[44:00] holy and sacred in itself
[44:03] when I say the holy incense the incense
[44:07] is not holy and sacred in itself it's
[44:10] holy and sacred in its purpose
[44:13] we understand so he's saying you make
[44:16] this and you use it there don't make
[44:18] anything like this for any other purpose
[44:19] this is Holy of the Lord
[44:23] when God called Israel out he wanted
[44:26] Israel for his purpose to serve his
[44:28] purpose and they were Holiness unto the
[44:31] Lord
[44:31] not holy in themselves but Holiness unto
[44:34] the Lord
[44:36] praise God let's go to Exodus 28.
[44:41] I hope this is making the picture
[44:43] clearer
[44:44] bit by bit
[44:46] like I said I do not want to make a
[44:48] simple subject complicated
[44:51] I want to keep it simple
[44:54] so
[44:56] Exodus 28
[45:00] verse 1.
[45:03] and take that one to the Aaron thy
[45:05] brother and his sons with him from among
[45:07] the children of Israel and he may
[45:08] Minister unto me in the priest's office
[45:10] even Aaron nadab and abahu Eliezer and
[45:13] ithamar Aaron's sons and thou shalt make
[45:16] holy garments for Aaron thy brother for
[45:18] Glory and for beauty
[45:21] so here he's making him holy garments is
[45:25] the linen holy is the hit linen sacred
[45:28] no it's made sacred because of its
[45:31] purpose
[45:33] it's now holy garments because these
[45:36] garments are only to be used on the
[45:38] right priesthood in the right service of
[45:41] the temple that makes them holy garments
[45:46] see they're so far we're talking about
[45:48] Holiness and we haven't even started
[45:51] talking about conduct yet
[45:54] we're talking about positioning and
[45:56] purpose and calling and selection and
[45:58] being set apart
[46:01] amen let's go to verse 35.
[46:10] and it shall be upon Aaron to minister
[46:12] and his sound shall be heard when you go
[46:14] within and unto the holy place before
[46:15] the Lord and when he cometh out that he
[46:18] die not and thou shall make a plate of
[46:20] pure gold and Grave upon it like the
[46:23] Engravings of a Signet Holiness to the
[46:27] Lord
[46:28] so when Aaron would go into the holy of
[46:30] holies he had a holy garment to put on
[46:33] he had he had holy anointing oil amen he
[46:37] he was when when Aaron was being dressed
[46:41] to go into the holy of holies he was
[46:44] being sanctified
[46:46] before he's out with the family he's at
[46:48] home he's doing whatever he's doing but
[46:50] in order to go into the holy of holies
[46:52] he had to be Sanctified so the act of
[46:55] sanctifying him was separating him from
[46:58] his brother separating from the people
[46:59] and preparing him for his purpose that
[47:02] was what they were doing to sanctify him
[47:04] so they put on him the linen amen they
[47:06] they put on him the uh the anointing oil
[47:09] he had to have the Holy garments he had
[47:12] to have the Holy miter and a golden
[47:14] plate on the miter that said Holiness
[47:16] unto the Lord he had to be separated
[47:19] from his brethren in dress and anointing
[47:22] and calling in purpose and he was holy
[47:25] unto God and he would go into the holy
[47:28] Place amen with a with a gold plate on
[47:31] his head that said Holiness unto the
[47:33] Lord amen he wasn't holy within himself
[47:36] he was made holy for his purpose
[47:40] he was Sanctified to do what God wanted
[47:44] him to do and he was Sanctified prepared
[47:46] set apart amen and moved into his
[47:49] purpose and it was Holiness unto the
[47:52] Lord for the whole nation was Holiness
[47:54] unto the Lord the whole act the whole
[47:56] Temple the whole worship everything was
[47:58] pointing to one thing we are separated
[48:01] we are dedicated we are consecrated to
[48:04] you
[48:06] and that was Holiness unto the Lord
[48:11] let's go to verse 40.
[48:17] and for Aaron's sons thou shall make
[48:19] coats and thou shalt make for them
[48:21] girdles and Bond as thou shall make for
[48:22] them glory and for beauty and thou shalt
[48:25] put upon upon them Aaron thy brother and
[48:27] his sons with him and shalt anoint them
[48:30] and consecrate them and sanctify them
[48:31] that they may Minister unto me in the
[48:34] priest's office
[48:37] amen these were not better people than
[48:40] other people
[48:42] they were Sanctified and consecrated and
[48:46] made holy for a purpose
[48:50] I hope you can see yourself
[48:53] I hope you can begin to see that if
[48:57] if Aaron would leave this priest office
[49:02] and Aaron would take off his garments
[49:04] and he would go home for the night and
[49:06] if Aaron's wife said something to him
[49:08] and he got sharp with her and said
[49:10] something that made her cry and hurt his
[49:11] feelings
[49:15] now was he no longer qualified
[49:17] to be a high priest because he's
[49:19] supposed to be holy
[49:22] it wasn't just his conduct that made him
[49:25] holy it was his separation it was his
[49:28] purpose it was his placing it was God
[49:30] calling him it was it that's what made
[49:33] him holy
[49:36] if he stayed in that purpose and he
[49:38] stayed in his conquered Consecration and
[49:40] he kept coming under the purification
[49:42] and the anointing and the right garments
[49:44] in the right place in his position and
[49:46] he kept doing what God called him to do
[49:48] amen and he kept offering sacrifices for
[49:51] his failures
[49:53] he would remain holy unto the Lord
[49:57] he was not he was not trying to obtain
[49:59] Holiness he was staying in Holiness
[50:02] because Holiness was his separation unto
[50:05] his office his position and he had to
[50:07] maintain that by sanctifying himself if
[50:11] he failed he had to give a transgress
[50:13] offering
[50:14] but he didn't amen he didn't he didn't
[50:17] he didn't no longer become Unholy amen
[50:21] he was holy because God chose him
[50:24] let's go to
[50:26] to Exodus 19.
[50:32] Exodus 19 and verse 9.
[50:43] and the Lord said unto Moses lo I come
[50:46] unto thee in a thick Cloud that the
[50:47] people may hear when I speak with thee
[50:50] and believe thee forever and Moses told
[50:53] the words of the people and to the Lord
[50:56] and the Lord said unto Moses go unto the
[50:58] people and sanctify them today and
[51:01] tomorrow and let them wash their clothes
[51:03] and be ready against the third day for
[51:06] the third day the Lord will
[51:08] the Lord will come down in the sight of
[51:10] all the people upon Mount Sinai so God
[51:14] tells Moses I'm going to come down and
[51:17] address his people you sanctify the
[51:19] people tell them to wash their clothes
[51:21] be separated be prepared for the third
[51:23] day they were sanctifying themselves in
[51:27] preparation to meet God and what were
[51:29] they doing they were just obeying what
[51:31] they were told to do amen
[51:33] so that's how they sanctify themselves
[51:35] to separate themselves and prepare
[51:36] themselves to meet with God now look at
[51:39] look at verse 23.
[51:42] and Moses said unto the Lord the people
[51:44] cannot come up to Mount Sinai for thou
[51:47] charges us saying set bounds about the
[51:49] mount and sanctify it
[51:52] so here we have the same word sanctify
[51:55] the people tell them to wash their
[51:57] clothes separate themselves and be set
[51:59] apart and be ready for the third day and
[52:01] now he tells them to sanctify the
[52:04] mountain
[52:05] did they wash the mountain
[52:09] did they put anointing oil on it
[52:12] how did they sanctify this mountain they
[52:14] put a barrier around it and wouldn't let
[52:16] anybody go up there and it was reserved
[52:17] and set apart and separated for God it
[52:20] was sanctified
[52:22] then the people when they were
[52:24] Sanctified they were given instructions
[52:26] in their sanctification to wash their
[52:28] clothes to set themselves apart and
[52:30] prepare themselves for the third day
[52:32] they were obeying the word setting
[52:34] themselves apart to meet God and the
[52:36] mountain was Sanctified set apart that
[52:38] this sanctification doesn't mean they
[52:41] washed it they scrubbed the bushes they
[52:45] they they sectioned it off so nobody
[52:48] could get on there and it was separated
[52:50] for gone the people were prepared by
[52:53] sanctifying themselves to meet God and
[52:55] you can see this is both sanctification
[52:58] both of this is sanctifying something so
[53:01] we realized that the real purpose to
[53:04] sanctify is to get something consecrated
[53:06] and separated for God's use amen and
[53:09] when it comes into that place where it's
[53:10] set apart for God it's now holy
[53:14] amen
[53:17] let's go to Exodus 20.
[53:20] and verse 8.
[53:25] remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy
[53:30] this is a day
[53:32] not a person not God this is a day
[53:37] but you're to keep it holy
[53:39] how do you keep a day how do you make a
[53:42] day holy
[53:43] you set it apart and you leave it for
[53:46] God's purpose
[53:48] amen remember the Sabbath day to keep it
[53:51] holy six days shout thou labor and do
[53:54] all thy work but in the seventh day is
[53:55] the Sabbath of the Lord thy God in it
[53:58] Thou shalt do thou shall not do any work
[54:01] thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy
[54:03] man servant nor thy maid servant nor thy
[54:05] cattle nor the stranger is within thy
[54:07] gates for in six days the Lord made
[54:10] Heaven and Earth and sea and all that's
[54:12] in them is and rested the seventh day
[54:14] wherefore the Lord blessed the seventh
[54:16] day and hallowed it
[54:19] so this word uh when it says remember
[54:21] this Habit to keep it holy and hallowed
[54:24] are the same word and these are the
[54:26] exact same Hebrew word that is
[54:29] translated sanctify for the people
[54:31] washing their clothes and sanctify to
[54:34] sanctify the mountain and holy for the
[54:37] day and hallowed for the day it's all
[54:39] the same thing what is it it is set
[54:42] apart and dedicated for a purpose
[54:45] set apart and dedicated for a purpose
[54:49] amen
[54:51] praise God
[54:52] so brother bam says now what shall we do
[54:55] in the message what shall we do with
[54:56] this Jesus called Christ he said a
[54:59] Nazarite is one one that separates
[55:01] themselves for the word of God not short
[55:04] wearing painted face Jezebels calling
[55:06] themselves Christians no sir man so
[55:08] wishy-washy that'll stand for a
[55:10] denomination and hold on to their
[55:11] coattails of some Caesar or Herod
[55:13] instead of standing for the word of God
[55:15] but God has got loyal people genuine
[55:18] flock of God who don't care what the
[55:20] world says they believe that Jesus
[55:22] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[55:24] forever amen let's turn to Numbers
[55:26] chapter six and I want to read about the
[55:29] Nazarite vow
[55:31] and see what the Lord said
[55:38] brother Birmingham said a Nazarite is
[55:40] one who separates themselves for the
[55:41] word of God and you'll find that brother
[55:43] Branham is going to pull this term
[55:44] Nazarite and pull it out of the Old
[55:46] Testament and even change the
[55:48] requirements for a Nazarite in the Old
[55:50] Testament and bring it into the believer
[55:52] today
[55:54] and so let's let's understand what this
[55:56] is in Numbers chapter 6 verse 1.
[56:01] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[56:03] Speak unto the children of Israel and
[56:05] say unto them when either man or woman
[56:07] shall separate themselves to a vow a vow
[56:10] of a Nazarite so what's this it's a
[56:13] separation
[56:15] to separate themselves unto the Lord so
[56:18] they have separated themselves unto the
[56:20] Lord let's keep reading he shall
[56:23] separate himself from wine and strong
[56:24] drink and shall drink no vinegar of wine
[56:27] or vinegar of strong drink neither shall
[56:29] he drink any liquor of grapes nor eat
[56:32] moist grapes or dried all the days of
[56:34] his separation shall he eat nothing that
[56:36] is made of the vine tree from the
[56:38] colonels even to the husk and all the
[56:41] days of the vow of his separation there
[56:43] shall no razor come upon his head until
[56:46] the days be fulfilled in the which he
[56:48] separateth himself unto the Lord he
[56:51] shall be holy and shall let the locks of
[56:54] the hair of his head grow all the days
[56:57] that he separated himself unto the Lord
[56:59] he shall come at no dead body he shall
[57:01] not make himself unclean for his father
[57:03] or for his mother for his brother or for
[57:06] a sister when they die because the
[57:08] because the consecration of his God is
[57:10] upon his head
[57:12] all the days of his separation he is
[57:15] Holy unto the Lord
[57:18] so this Nazarite he is going to be he's
[57:21] taking a vow of Separation he's
[57:23] separating from everything and he is
[57:25] dedicating and consecrating himself unto
[57:28] God for a period of time amen and when
[57:30] he does that he is called holy unto the
[57:34] Lord why is he holy unto the Lord well
[57:37] it's obvious brother Chad he didn't cut
[57:39] his hair and he didn't drink wine and it
[57:42] it's not his actions it's not the Deeds
[57:45] that make him holy it's the fact that he
[57:48] consecrated and separated himself to the
[57:50] Lord that made him holy unto the Lord
[57:53] amen it wasn't that he drank wine or
[57:56] didn't drink wine because when Jesus
[57:57] came he drank wine but he was he was
[58:00] holy unto the Lord
[58:02] right it wasn't that he cut his hair
[58:04] didn't cut his hair those were all part
[58:06] of the Nazarite vow when he wanted to
[58:09] separate himself amen he would go
[58:11] through a process of consecrating
[58:13] himself or sanctifying himself where he
[58:16] would do the things that God said do to
[58:19] enter into this period where he is
[58:21] dedicated holy to the Lord and God would
[58:23] say he is Holy to the Lord he is Holy to
[58:26] me because he is set apart for me for
[58:29] this period of time only not for work
[58:31] not for family not for anything else he
[58:34] is dedicated to me
[58:35] and that made him holy
[58:42] I hope we're understanding Holiness a
[58:44] little better
[58:46] Holiness is not long hair long skirt
[58:49] keeping conduct rules
[58:52] that's not holiness
[58:54] that can be part of it
[58:57] but Holiness is a separation to God
[59:01] a dedication to God
[59:04] brother Benham said in God's word calls
[59:06] for a total separation from unbelief it
[59:08] says no matter what the price the world
[59:10] has to say about it out there or how
[59:12] many scornful or laughters are critics
[59:14] that doesn't bother a person that's
[59:15] totally separated from the things of the
[59:17] world to the things of God they obey the
[59:20] word and separate themselves from the
[59:22] things of the world because the word
[59:25] separates them
[59:27] this is so important to know that we
[59:29] can't just say I'm going to take a
[59:31] Nazarite vow and I'm not going to work
[59:34] and I'm not going to uh go home to my
[59:37] family but I'm going to the woods and
[59:39] I'm going to pray amen that's not
[59:41] necessarily
[59:43] what we're talking about
[59:47] he says here's what brother bear says in
[59:49] the same message a little further down
[59:50] he says but when a man is born in the
[59:53] world for a Believer he becomes a
[59:56] Nazarite when he separates himself from
[59:59] anything that's contrary to the word
[1:00:02] what what is it to be a Nazarite in this
[1:00:05] day it is not to let your locks grow
[1:00:07] long it is not to not eat this and not
[1:00:10] drink that and not touch a dead body
[1:00:12] that's not what it means in this day in
[1:00:14] this state to be a Nazarite means that
[1:00:16] you you stay far away from anything
[1:00:18] that's contrary to the word you don't
[1:00:20] touch it you don't partake of it amen
[1:00:22] but you consecrate and dedicate yourself
[1:00:24] for the word
[1:00:26] that's what it means to be a Nazarite
[1:00:27] and if you're a Nazarite you're holy
[1:00:29] unto the Lord
[1:00:31] is what he says a Nazarite is Holy unto
[1:00:33] the Lord amen and what separates us not
[1:00:36] our thinking not our ideas not our own
[1:00:39] standard not our own Traditions that's
[1:00:41] not what separates us what separates us
[1:00:43] is the word
[1:00:45] so brother Graham says the word is what
[1:00:47] separates us because automatically when
[1:00:49] the word comes forth amen when the word
[1:00:51] comes forth then we make a choice on the
[1:00:54] word if we choose the word then there's
[1:00:56] something we didn't choose
[1:00:58] if we say yes to this there's something
[1:01:01] else we say no to
[1:01:03] it's like a woman when she's being
[1:01:04] courted amen she may have in a young
[1:01:07] sister she may have had a couple
[1:01:09] different brothers that were interested
[1:01:10] in her and Friends of her and talking to
[1:01:12] her amen and but if if one of them comes
[1:01:15] up and says will you marry me what he's
[1:01:17] saying is will you sanctify and
[1:01:19] consecrate yourself to be holy unto me
[1:01:23] that's what he's asking her
[1:01:25] because when they take the vow they says
[1:01:27] will you will you separate from all else
[1:01:28] holding only unto thee
[1:01:32] he's asking her would you sanctify and
[1:01:35] consecrate yourself and be holy unto me
[1:01:40] and if she says yes
[1:01:43] then she automatically separated herself
[1:01:47] and said no to the other suitors
[1:01:51] it wasn't is it this this separation and
[1:01:55] being holy to God is not our concept or
[1:01:59] our idea or or a set of things that we
[1:02:03] think that would be better no it is
[1:02:06] saying yes to the word when we say yes
[1:02:09] to the word we say no to the world and
[1:02:11] the things that are of the world and
[1:02:13] when the word show when God shows us
[1:02:15] through the word through the ministry of
[1:02:17] a prophet through the scriptures what
[1:02:19] his desire is and we say yes to that
[1:02:21] we've said no to that and then we begin
[1:02:23] to consecrate and sanctify ourselves to
[1:02:25] that word to do what to obey it amen
[1:02:28] because when you recognize that God said
[1:02:31] amen for a woman to wear clothes that's
[1:02:33] Abomination that pertain to a man it's
[1:02:35] an Abomination to God then you says I
[1:02:38] say yes to that when you said yes to
[1:02:40] that you said no to all kinds of other
[1:02:42] fashions
[1:02:44] and then when you Sanctified yourself to
[1:02:47] that word you had to actually go in your
[1:02:50] closet and take the garments down put
[1:02:52] them in a sack and throw them away or
[1:02:53] take them to Goodwill or whatever you
[1:02:55] did with them
[1:02:56] and what were you doing you were
[1:02:58] sanctifying yourself
[1:03:01] not because you thought well I think
[1:03:04] it's more pleasing to God to wear blue
[1:03:06] than khaki
[1:03:09] no
[1:03:10] you chose the word
[1:03:12] when you saw the word you said yes to
[1:03:15] the word when you said yes to the word
[1:03:17] you separated from something to unite
[1:03:20] with something and when you did you
[1:03:22] Sanctified yourself unto that purpose
[1:03:24] and when you Sanctified yourself into
[1:03:26] that purpose for the word you were
[1:03:28] becoming holy unto the Lord because you
[1:03:31] were separating from the world and
[1:03:32] coming to his word and he is the word
[1:03:37] it wasn't it wasn't the Garment that
[1:03:41] made you holy amen it was the
[1:03:43] Consecration and dedication to God that
[1:03:46] made you holy
[1:03:48] are we starting to see the dividing line
[1:03:51] because a lot of people brother Benham
[1:03:52] said you can have long hair and a skirt
[1:03:54] and all these other things and he said
[1:03:56] enough temper to fight a buzz soul
[1:03:58] there's still something wrong that's not
[1:04:00] holiness
[1:04:02] right we can we can have uh we can have
[1:04:05] conduct order and Doctrine let's just
[1:04:07] say
[1:04:08] and still not have Holiness because what
[1:04:11] we've done is not just take the word and
[1:04:13] separate to unite with the person of the
[1:04:15] word what we're doing is we're keeping a
[1:04:17] standard of a church to conform to a
[1:04:19] church or for whatever motivation we
[1:04:21] have for doing that
[1:04:23] but that doesn't equal holiness
[1:04:25] you say why do you dress that way
[1:04:27] because I'm part of a Holiness Church
[1:04:32] you understand how foolish that
[1:04:34] statement is
[1:04:36] the only way that you can be part of
[1:04:39] Holiness is to be wholly dedicated to
[1:04:41] God
[1:04:42] the only way you can be holy is to be
[1:04:44] holy surrendered to God that's the only
[1:04:46] way to be holy
[1:04:47] not to wear a certain type of garment uh
[1:04:50] not to the the to speak in a certain way
[1:04:52] and fellowship with certain kinds of
[1:04:54] people you can do all of those things
[1:04:56] and not be holy so they cannot be equal
[1:04:58] to holiness
[1:05:00] but what can be equal to Holiness a
[1:05:03] surrender to the word of God can be
[1:05:05] equal to holiness
[1:05:07] would it change the way you dress
[1:05:08] without a shadow of a doubt will you
[1:05:12] consecrate yourself to that word without
[1:05:13] a shadow of a doubt will you separate
[1:05:15] from the things of the world without a
[1:05:17] shadow of a doubt amen because you chose
[1:05:20] the word that make and you've separated
[1:05:22] from everything to the word You Are Holy
[1:05:25] unto the Lord amen that will change
[1:05:28] everything because because it changes
[1:05:30] everything
[1:05:32] when God when God called out Aaron to be
[1:05:36] the high priest amen God gave him
[1:05:39] special garments God gave him special
[1:05:41] anoint anointing God gave him a special
[1:05:44] miter he gave him all of these things
[1:05:46] and and God calling him made him holy
[1:05:49] and all these garments were holy and
[1:05:51] everything was holy
[1:05:54] but what if somebody from the tribe of
[1:05:56] God would come on and put on holy
[1:05:58] garments and put on holy perfume and
[1:06:01] take a holy miter and take the holy
[1:06:03] incense would it make them holy unto the
[1:06:06] Lord absolutely not amen they can't be
[1:06:09] holy unto the Lord by copying somebody
[1:06:11] else that's holy unto the Lord
[1:06:14] nobody else in Israel could take Aaron's
[1:06:17] place and be holy unto the Lord they
[1:06:20] would become an Abomination because they
[1:06:23] weren't called to that position
[1:06:27] so you cannot be holy by copying
[1:06:30] somebody else's holiness
[1:06:34] what is the only thing that can make us
[1:06:37] holy
[1:06:39] is to surrender completely to the word
[1:06:44] take the position he's called us into
[1:06:48] listen we cannot make ourselves holy
[1:06:52] into the Lord by any action by any
[1:06:55] conduct by any idea by empty
[1:06:58] acknowledgment out of our mouth
[1:07:00] because first in order to be holy unto
[1:07:02] the Lord you have to be chosen by the
[1:07:05] Lord
[1:07:06] and if you're not chosen by the Lord
[1:07:08] you'll never be holy unto the Lord
[1:07:12] Israel had to be chosen before they
[1:07:14] could be holy
[1:07:16] their choosing is what made them holy
[1:07:18] when they consecrated themselves and
[1:07:20] gave themselves over they were holy unto
[1:07:22] the Lord
[1:07:23] uh Levi had to be chosen Aaron had to be
[1:07:27] chosen first they have to be chosen and
[1:07:30] for you to be holy unto the Lord first
[1:07:32] you must be chosen you must be part of
[1:07:34] the elect predestinated bride of Jesus
[1:07:36] Christ you must be chosen and when
[1:07:39] you're chosen you must surrender to that
[1:07:41] position because Aaron had to surrender
[1:07:43] Moses had to surrender Israel had to
[1:07:46] surrender
[1:07:49] see when we look at this with this
[1:07:51] subject it's so perfect because it is
[1:07:53] not like you'd look at the subject of
[1:07:55] Holiness and say
[1:07:57] that's all that's all up to me
[1:08:00] it's up to me I've got to do this and
[1:08:02] I've got to do that you can't do nothing
[1:08:04] unless God called you
[1:08:05] all your efforts will be wasted
[1:08:08] but neither can you say well it's up to
[1:08:11] God I'll sit here if he wants to be holy
[1:08:12] he'll make me holy it's not that way
[1:08:14] either
[1:08:16] so what is holiness
[1:08:18] when God choosing me gives me a
[1:08:21] revelation of what God wants and I
[1:08:23] surrender to God that equals holiness
[1:08:27] there are things I have to give up
[1:08:29] things I have to choose things I have to
[1:08:31] lay down I must sanctify myself I must
[1:08:33] dedicate myself I must consecrate myself
[1:08:36] but I'll tell you what all the giving up
[1:08:38] and all the consecrating when we equal
[1:08:39] nothing unless he first has called me
[1:08:41] and consecrated me and dedicated me to
[1:08:44] himself
[1:08:45] there's two parts to this equation we
[1:08:47] can't have it all over here or all over
[1:08:49] here it's right here in the middle God
[1:08:51] calls God designates God has a position
[1:08:54] in placing for each one of us when we
[1:08:56] step into that and surrender to that and
[1:08:59] give our whole lives to the word of God
[1:09:01] we can now become Holiness unto the Lord
[1:09:04] praise God almighty
[1:09:07] brother bam says in the Christ is the
[1:09:09] mystery of God revealed he says he
[1:09:11] proves his resurrection life then as he
[1:09:14] vindicates himself
[1:09:16] she the bride is independent from all
[1:09:19] others she's an independent woman a
[1:09:22] Great Speckled Bird that's different
[1:09:23] from all others you remember the Bible
[1:09:24] and that the Great Speckled Bird but she
[1:09:27] had his name she had his life how did
[1:09:30] they speckle the bird they were both
[1:09:32] white then they pulled the head off of
[1:09:34] one bird and drained the blood out on
[1:09:35] the other bird and the other bird
[1:09:37] speckled with the red blood and it
[1:09:38] flopped its wings like this and the
[1:09:40] blood cried holy holy holy as it made
[1:09:43] the ground so Christ the dead mate put
[1:09:46] his blood his blood from his life
[1:09:49] into a Sprinkle carrying his blood
[1:09:51] crying holy holy holy unto the Lord it's
[1:09:55] an odd looking bird sure it is but she
[1:09:58] the bride is identified by him
[1:10:02] that's so important
[1:10:04] she's identified not by herself she's
[1:10:06] identified by him
[1:10:08] should identify by them and she is
[1:10:09] independent from all others keep thee
[1:10:13] only under her as long as you both live
[1:10:14] keep thee only unto him the word no
[1:10:16] adultery not one sign of denomination
[1:10:19] not one sign of creed no adultery at all
[1:10:21] the word and him alone on Christ the
[1:10:25] solid rock I stand all other grounds is
[1:10:27] sinking sand said Airy perronet that's
[1:10:31] it Christ the word he was the word he is
[1:10:33] the word and the church becomes the word
[1:10:35] by him making her a part of him and
[1:10:39] that's the word again
[1:10:40] personally identified by him his
[1:10:43] property alone his property alone
[1:10:48] I say if she is his property alone she
[1:10:51] is Holy unto the Lord
[1:10:54] if that's his property alone she is Holy
[1:10:57] unto the Lord
[1:10:58] she is Redeemed by him through him for
[1:11:02] him and for him alone
[1:11:06] that's right then what the devil is
[1:11:08] howling about that it's being revealed
[1:11:11] what is the what is the problem is that
[1:11:14] she's coming to this realization of what
[1:11:16] true Holiness is amen she's Redeemed by
[1:11:19] him for him to him and him alone what's
[1:11:22] that mean is she a Sanctified
[1:11:24] consecrated dedicated to him
[1:11:28] she is given holy to him she is now holy
[1:11:34] unto him
[1:11:36] making her a holy bride
[1:11:39] not holy because of her conduct not only
[1:11:42] because of her action holy because he
[1:11:45] chose her for himself and she
[1:11:47] surrendered to him now she is a holy
[1:11:50] bride
[1:11:52] and do you think that Holy bride who has
[1:11:55] been selected called by him by him
[1:12:00] for him to him and him alone
[1:12:05] she can't be anything else but a holy
[1:12:07] bride
[1:12:09] and then if she has heard the call and
[1:12:13] heard the word and separated from every
[1:12:16] other idea
[1:12:17] separated from every other concept
[1:12:19] separated from every other tradition
[1:12:21] separated from everything and United to
[1:12:24] her headship to Christ
[1:12:26] then she is a holy bride
[1:12:30] do you think if she goes out tomorrow
[1:12:32] and makes a mistake and fails
[1:12:35] that she is no longer a holy bride
[1:12:39] do you think she's no longer chosen by
[1:12:42] God
[1:12:43] you think she's no longer predestinated
[1:12:45] or elected no but she must sanctify
[1:12:48] herself and keep herself sanctified
[1:12:51] she must come back through repentance
[1:12:54] and stay connected to Christ
[1:12:59] she's not Holy by title only
[1:13:03] right Jesus I mean God he designated a
[1:13:06] People Israel they were as holy people
[1:13:08] they were holding us unto the Lord he
[1:13:10] wanted to to to use them to demonstrate
[1:13:13] himself but when they backslid and left
[1:13:15] him he allowed them to get taken into
[1:13:17] bondage and taken far away amen it
[1:13:20] looked terrible but God never forgot his
[1:13:22] people
[1:13:24] and he brought them back God will never
[1:13:26] forget his chosen elect bride
[1:13:30] do we make mistakes absolutely we make
[1:13:32] mistakes but how have we lost our
[1:13:34] position
[1:13:35] only if we're not elect
[1:13:40] we have to
[1:13:42] sanctify
[1:13:43] ourselves
[1:13:45] but in sanctify ourselves will never
[1:13:47] make us a holy bride
[1:13:49] if he didn't call us to be a holy bride
[1:13:54] let's turn to the New Testament I'm
[1:13:55] going to look at a few scriptures in New
[1:13:57] Testament let's go to Second
[1:13:57] Thessalonians
[1:14:02] foreign
[1:14:10] Thessalonians
[1:14:12] chapter 2.
[1:14:16] and we're going to read verse 13.
[1:14:23] second Thessalonians 2 and 13.
[1:14:27] for this cause also thank we god without
[1:14:30] ceasing because when ye received the
[1:14:32] word of God which you heard of us you
[1:14:34] received it not as the word of men but
[1:14:37] as it is in truth the word of God which
[1:14:39] effects he worketh also in you that
[1:14:41] believe for ye Brethren became followers
[1:14:44] of the churches of God which are in I'm
[1:14:46] sorry
[1:14:48] I did it again I'm in first
[1:14:50] Thessalonians
[1:14:51] I would love it if something
[1:14:53] Supernatural would happen now and I
[1:14:55] could look back and say that was because
[1:14:56] of this
[1:14:58] not just because I can't read
[1:15:01] second Thessalonians 2 13 but we are
[1:15:04] bound to give thanks always to God for
[1:15:05] you Brethren beloved to the Lord because
[1:15:07] God has from the beginning chosen you to
[1:15:09] Salvation through sanctification of the
[1:15:12] spirit and belief of the truth God has
[1:15:15] chosen you into salvation through
[1:15:17] sanctification of spirit and belief of
[1:15:19] the truth and this word sanctification
[1:15:21] means consecration or purification it's
[1:15:24] used in the Bible to mean sanctification
[1:15:26] and holiness
[1:15:28] brother Branham picked up this term this
[1:15:31] word here and here's how he described
[1:15:32] him he says in the future home he says
[1:15:35] now let me take this board just a minute
[1:15:37] and he's drawing something on the
[1:15:38] Blackboard here is a human heart I'm a
[1:15:41] long ways from being an artist here is a
[1:15:42] human heart and here's a human heart
[1:15:44] he's got two human hearts now this one
[1:15:46] over here has a snake in it that sin
[1:15:48] here he has his life this one over here
[1:15:51] is a dove in it which is the holy spirit
[1:15:53] here he has
[1:15:55] here he has life well this one here he
[1:15:58] has malice hatred Envy that's what's
[1:16:00] causing it is this fellow here well this
[1:16:03] one over here has love and joy and
[1:16:04] long-suffering that's what does it down
[1:16:06] here now when you're asked
[1:16:09] or you are forgiven of your sins you're
[1:16:11] only done this taking that away taken
[1:16:14] the sin the hatred malice and all that
[1:16:16] away but the thing that made you do it
[1:16:18] is still there that's the old root of
[1:16:20] evil it's still there notice when you
[1:16:22] repent and are baptized in the name of
[1:16:24] the Lord Jesus Christ that he forgave
[1:16:26] you of your sins notice then secondly
[1:16:29] comes sanctification which sets our mind
[1:16:31] in order for Holiness to think right
[1:16:35] sanctification is a compound Greek word
[1:16:37] which means cleaned and set aside for
[1:16:40] service brother goes through this and it
[1:16:42] goes through this in the New Birth that
[1:16:44] first we're Justified amen then we're
[1:16:46] Sanctified cleans and set aside for
[1:16:48] service then he goes on he says the next
[1:16:50] comes the baptism of the fire of the
[1:16:52] Holy Ghost and God might dwell in us and
[1:16:55] the fire of God cleanses our hearts from
[1:16:57] sin and puts the Holy Ghost Inside then
[1:16:59] we bring forth the same life that this
[1:17:01] did because that's in us so he begins to
[1:17:04] tell us that we have justification
[1:17:06] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:17:08] Ghost and sanctification is cleansed
[1:17:11] amen by the spirit of God and belief of
[1:17:13] the truth cleansed and set aside for
[1:17:15] service and then in the filling of the
[1:17:17] Holy Ghost we're put into service
[1:17:19] uh there's a reason I'm getting into
[1:17:21] this I want to read this next quote in
[1:17:22] birth pains
[1:17:24] and so it is in the spiritual realm it's
[1:17:26] water justification by faith believing
[1:17:28] on God receiving him as your personal
[1:17:30] Savior and being baptized second is
[1:17:33] sanctification of the spirit that God
[1:17:35] cleanses the spirit from all elements of
[1:17:37] the world and the desire of the world
[1:17:39] and then the Holy Spirit comes in and
[1:17:41] gives New Birth and fills up that
[1:17:43] Sanctified vessel
[1:17:45] for instance like this now that I told
[1:17:47] you what what you don't believe lay
[1:17:49] aside and take he's talking about eating
[1:17:51] that cherry pie spitting out the seed
[1:17:53] take the pie now a glass is laying on
[1:17:56] the chicken yard
[1:17:57] you don't just pick that up and put it
[1:17:59] on your table and fill it up with water
[1:18:00] or milk no by picking it up it's
[1:18:03] justification
[1:18:05] cleansing it is sanctification because
[1:18:07] the Greek word sanctify is a compound
[1:18:09] word Mission clean cleanse and set aside
[1:18:12] for service not in service for service
[1:18:14] then when you fill it it's put in
[1:18:17] service so he starts telling the analogy
[1:18:20] of a glass that's in a hog pin and a
[1:18:23] manure pile and you pick it up that's
[1:18:25] justification that's God choosing it
[1:18:27] amen that's gone God's beginning the
[1:18:30] process of setting it apart
[1:18:33] amen if God didn't choose you you're not
[1:18:36] chosen amen you can't choose yourself
[1:18:39] no man can come to me lest the father
[1:18:41] draws him amen it's got to be God doing
[1:18:44] the drawing for us to even come to him
[1:18:46] so when he picks you up what's he doing
[1:18:48] he's beginning the whole process of
[1:18:50] setting you apart he's separating you
[1:18:53] from the world he's pulling you to
[1:18:54] himself amen he's beginning the whole
[1:18:57] process then what he does by the washing
[1:18:59] of the water of the word he begins to
[1:19:01] wash and Purge and clean that glass so
[1:19:04] that he can use it for a purpose
[1:19:07] then when it's all cleaned amen and
[1:19:10] ready he'll fill that glass amen when
[1:19:13] you take a natural glass you'll feel it
[1:19:14] and you'll set it on the table and use
[1:19:16] it for a drinking glass you'll use it
[1:19:17] for a purpose that's what God is doing
[1:19:19] with each one of us amen he is drawing
[1:19:22] us to himself he's choosing us selecting
[1:19:25] us setting us apart from the world first
[1:19:28] he grabs a hold of us by drawing us to
[1:19:31] himself he claims us for his own your
[1:19:33] mind we're redeemed then he begins to
[1:19:36] clean us and sanctify us amen and what's
[1:19:39] he doing he's dedicating us preparing us
[1:19:41] by the word for a service and then he's
[1:19:44] putting us into service
[1:19:47] what is that whole process Holiness unto
[1:19:50] the Lord
[1:19:51] being set aside and used for his purpose
[1:19:53] the same thing he did with the high
[1:19:55] priest the same thing he did with Israel
[1:19:56] to say he he is he is redeeming
[1:20:00] cleansing sanctifying and putting in the
[1:20:04] service that is holiness
[1:20:06] unto the Lord
[1:20:11] now
[1:20:12] let's look at First Peter
[1:20:21] First Peter chapter 2.
[1:20:24] just want to go just just a little bit
[1:20:26] further just a few more scriptures
[1:20:31] First Peter chapter 2.
[1:20:34] verse 9.
[1:20:40] but you are our chosen generation
[1:20:43] a royal priesthood
[1:20:45] a holy nation
[1:20:48] A peculiar people that you should show
[1:20:50] forth the Praises of him who hath called
[1:20:53] you out of Darkness Into The Marvelous
[1:20:55] Light which in time past were not a
[1:20:58] people but are now the people of God
[1:21:00] which have not obtained Mercy but now
[1:21:02] have obtained Mercy
[1:21:05] the first part of this verse 9 he's
[1:21:07] using language that is almost identical
[1:21:10] to the way God spoke about Israel
[1:21:13] when God selected Israel out of all
[1:21:15] Nations and he chose them for his own
[1:21:17] purpose and he Sanctified them unto
[1:21:20] himself by pulling them out of Egypt and
[1:21:22] redeeming them amen and he intended to
[1:21:25] clean them up all the way and put them
[1:21:27] in the service to take back the land
[1:21:29] amen and so God had a purpose and a plan
[1:21:32] for that but now he says you who are not
[1:21:35] a people you're not is or you were not a
[1:21:37] people amen are now become as people
[1:21:40] but he said you're a chosen generation
[1:21:41] verse 9 a royal priesthood a holy nation
[1:21:46] he's talking to dispersed Gentiles amen
[1:21:50] Gentiles that were heathens Gentiles
[1:21:53] that were pagans Gentiles that that knew
[1:21:56] not God Amen and they've come to the to
[1:21:58] the knowledge of Jesus Christ they've
[1:22:00] come to the gospel message and he says
[1:22:03] you're a holy nation amen and it's
[1:22:06] amazing that he called them a holy
[1:22:07] nation because there was still so much
[1:22:09] growing they needed to do
[1:22:11] Peter began to talk to our Paul began to
[1:22:13] talk to them and admonish them in
[1:22:15] Corinthians and talk to them about their
[1:22:16] immaturity and the wrong use of gifts
[1:22:18] and and sin that they let in the church
[1:22:20] there was so much that was still wrong
[1:22:23] with this this people this fledgling
[1:22:25] Christian church but Peter looks at them
[1:22:27] and says you are a chosen generation you
[1:22:30] are a royal priesthood you are a holy
[1:22:32] nation amen and that's the same thing
[1:22:34] God did to Israel You Were My Chosen you
[1:22:37] were my redeemed I redeemed you you were
[1:22:39] my firstborn amen then he calls levite
[1:22:42] You Are Holy unto me he calls Aaron You
[1:22:44] Are Holy unto me amen there was a whole
[1:22:47] lot of work that needed to be done to
[1:22:48] them
[1:22:49] a whole lot of cleaning up that still
[1:22:51] needed to take place in their lives and
[1:22:53] meant a whole lot of sanctification
[1:22:55] separation and dedication there was a
[1:22:57] lot of things they needed to learn about
[1:22:59] God and line up to but it didn't change
[1:23:01] the fact that he called them to be a
[1:23:03] holy nation and in this early fledgling
[1:23:05] Church there was a whole lot Paul had to
[1:23:08] set straight in the gospels there was a
[1:23:10] lot of correction that needed to take
[1:23:11] place a lot of wrong understanding and a
[1:23:14] misuse of things but they were still a
[1:23:17] chosen generation
[1:23:19] they were still a royal priesthood as
[1:23:22] much as levite was a priesthood would
[1:23:24] always be a priesthood because of God's
[1:23:26] designation this too is a royal
[1:23:28] priesthood
[1:23:30] a holy nation
[1:23:33] that's why this Bride is a holy bride
[1:23:38] and you can look at that and you can
[1:23:39] look in the mirror and you could say I'm
[1:23:41] no holy bride
[1:23:43] I did this and I've done that
[1:23:46] you're looking at the wrong place
[1:23:49] you need to look in this mirror
[1:23:52] you need to look to what God has called
[1:23:55] to himself that God has designated to
[1:23:58] himself that God has chosen for himself
[1:24:00] Hey listen levite was not a tribe that
[1:24:04] had a tremendous blessing on them even
[1:24:06] Isaac at his death when he when he spoke
[1:24:09] the blessing over his children and Levi
[1:24:11] he reminded levite that he was cruel in
[1:24:14] the way that he dealt with a nation amen
[1:24:16] when he when they tricked him when he
[1:24:18] and his brother tricked them into
[1:24:20] circumcision then went in and killed
[1:24:21] them all lied to them deceived them and
[1:24:23] killed them all and Israel said you make
[1:24:25] me stink amongst other people
[1:24:28] levite wasn't chosen because he was the
[1:24:31] nicest boy
[1:24:32] and the nicest tribe he was chosen
[1:24:35] because he was God's choice
[1:24:37] and God didn't choose you to be in the
[1:24:39] bride because you were the nicest person
[1:24:43] how many how many of us wish we were
[1:24:45] nicer
[1:24:48] I mean you see another brother and he's
[1:24:50] so friendly he's got that gregorious
[1:24:52] personality and everybody loves me
[1:24:54] around him when he walks in the room
[1:24:55] people stand ah brother and they hug you
[1:24:56] and you walk in the room they're like hi
[1:25:00] some people have Magnetic Personality
[1:25:02] some people don't some people are so
[1:25:04] smooth and easy some people are a little
[1:25:05] rough
[1:25:07] and you look at this when you compare
[1:25:09] and we error comparing ourselves among
[1:25:12] ourselves and we think that brother's
[1:25:13] made it but I haven't and you know
[1:25:16] and we start to judge based off what we
[1:25:20] see and not judge based off what God has
[1:25:23] chose
[1:25:25] you are a holy people
[1:25:31] you say but you don't know what I did
[1:25:32] yet yesterday if God has chose you if
[1:25:35] you're elected bride if you're the seat
[1:25:37] Gene of God call for this day you're a
[1:25:39] holy people
[1:25:43] what is it we need to do we need to
[1:25:45] surrender
[1:25:46] we need to consecrate ourselves to that
[1:25:49] word
[1:25:50] God has done his part by calling us he's
[1:25:53] done his part by identifying Us in the
[1:25:56] word now we must do our part by choosing
[1:26:00] no to everything that's not the word and
[1:26:02] saying yes to everything that is the
[1:26:03] word and consecrating ourselves to this
[1:26:05] word to come into what he's already told
[1:26:08] us we are
[1:26:12] it's not this Holiness is not something
[1:26:15] we attain to
[1:26:16] through sinless perfection
[1:26:19] this Holiness is something he's called
[1:26:21] us to by positional placement
[1:26:27] let's go to Ephesians chapter 5.
[1:26:33] very familiar
[1:26:34] to all of us but so necessary
[1:26:38] in this teaching Ephesians chapter 5
[1:26:40] verse 25.
[1:26:44] Ephesians 5 and 25 husbands love your
[1:26:46] wives even as Christ also loved the
[1:26:48] church and gave himself for him that he
[1:26:50] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[1:26:54] washing of the Water by the word that he
[1:26:57] might present it to himself a glorious
[1:27:00] church not having spot or wrink or any
[1:27:03] such thing but that it should be holy
[1:27:05] and without blemish
[1:27:08] God wants a spotless wrinkle-free bride
[1:27:12] yes is that what he wants
[1:27:15] so God will present to himself
[1:27:18] a bride without Sparta wrinkle he's not
[1:27:22] asking the bride to present herself
[1:27:25] without spot her ankle
[1:27:27] read this correctly because if we read
[1:27:29] this wrong we go back to Nazarene
[1:27:31] understanding
[1:27:32] we go back to Pentecostal Holiness
[1:27:35] understanding he didn't ask the bride to
[1:27:37] present herself spotless and wrinkle
[1:27:40] free he said he will present himself a
[1:27:43] bride without spot or wrinkle or any
[1:27:45] such thing
[1:27:46] how's he going to do it he's going to
[1:27:48] wash her
[1:27:49] how's he going to wash her with the
[1:27:51] washing of the Water by the word
[1:27:55] God has sent the washing in this day God
[1:27:59] has sent the purifying in this day he
[1:28:02] has sent the Waters of Separation that
[1:28:04] separate us from the world and to
[1:28:07] himself Amen in the in the Old Testament
[1:28:09] they had a water of separation and it
[1:28:11] was made with the ashes of a red heifer
[1:28:13] they were told to take a red heifer
[1:28:15] without spot without blemish and
[1:28:17] Perfection go outside the camp burn the
[1:28:19] red heifer take the ashes mix it with
[1:28:21] water and every vessel in the Tabernacle
[1:28:24] was Sanctified was cleansed by the ashes
[1:28:26] of the red Heaven the water was
[1:28:28] sprinkled on it and it was determined
[1:28:29] clean the water without the water of
[1:28:32] sprinkling it was not yet ready for
[1:28:33] service although it was ordained for
[1:28:36] service
[1:28:39] it was ordained it was made according to
[1:28:41] what God said it was it was separated
[1:28:43] unto its service but it must be
[1:28:45] Sanctified how was it Washed by the
[1:28:47] ashes of a red heifer the Waters of
[1:28:49] Separation that separated it to God's
[1:28:52] purpose
[1:28:56] so how was God
[1:28:58] cleansing his Temple
[1:29:01] through the waters of separation
[1:29:04] through the word
[1:29:05] God sent a word in this day a pure word
[1:29:09] a clean word a perfect word and that
[1:29:13] word is the word that is washing his
[1:29:15] bride
[1:29:16] so that he can present to himself a
[1:29:20] bride without spot a wrinkle he's not
[1:29:22] asking us to jump through hoops he's not
[1:29:24] setting the bar higher and higher and
[1:29:26] higher what he's done is he's called us
[1:29:28] to himself he's told us we're a holy
[1:29:31] nation he told us we're A peculiar
[1:29:33] people that were his holy bride and then
[1:29:35] he is bringing a washing of water that
[1:29:38] will make us everything he said we are
[1:29:41] if we will surrender to the word
[1:29:46] remember there's the two parts again
[1:29:48] there's the part God does and there's a
[1:29:50] part we do
[1:29:54] brother Bram says in broken sisters to
[1:29:56] me he is the Waters of the word of
[1:29:58] Separation that separates you from
[1:30:00] everything that's contrary to his word
[1:30:03] that's the fountain I believe him to be
[1:30:05] yes sir that's the waters that separated
[1:30:07] me from the man-made sister who's the
[1:30:09] Fountain of Living Water
[1:30:11] and the seed shall possess the Gate of
[1:30:13] his enemy he says and the Holy Spirit is
[1:30:16] our circumcision it's God's sharp knife
[1:30:19] it separates and cuts off the surplus of
[1:30:21] the Flesh of the world from us the word
[1:30:23] of God sharper than a two-edged sword so
[1:30:25] you see come right back again the word
[1:30:28] of God is the thing that the Holy Spirit
[1:30:30] uses not Creeds not denominations but
[1:30:34] the word is what separates us from the
[1:30:36] things of the world it cuts away our
[1:30:38] ideas and things and holy consecrates us
[1:30:41] to God
[1:30:42] if the word Cuts away the world and we
[1:30:46] stay surrendered to the word it cuts
[1:30:48] away the world and keeps us holy
[1:30:50] consecrated to God what's the word doing
[1:30:53] the word is sanctifying us the word is
[1:30:56] cleansing us the word is purging us the
[1:30:59] word is purifying us the word is
[1:31:01] sanctifying us to bring us into that
[1:31:04] position of holiness
[1:31:08] he's gone
[1:31:10] and the message here ye him he says this
[1:31:13] is the washing of the water of
[1:31:15] Separation by the word the word what
[1:31:17] washes us and cleanses us sanctify he
[1:31:21] says sanctify them Father through the
[1:31:23] truth
[1:31:24] said Thy word is truth is that right and
[1:31:27] we're washed of the Waters of the
[1:31:29] separation from our sins by the word of
[1:31:31] God the word separates us and sets us in
[1:31:34] place
[1:31:35] now listen we have to we we want to
[1:31:38] recognize what he's talking about he's
[1:31:39] not talking about playing a tape and so
[1:31:41] I play the tape and now I'm washed
[1:31:44] that makes sense
[1:31:46] I read my Bible I read the church age
[1:31:48] book now I'm clean
[1:31:51] it's not the hearing it's the surrender
[1:31:54] to
[1:31:56] it's The Obedience it's the surrender he
[1:31:59] brings the word you can't bring the word
[1:32:00] you can't wash yourself he has to do the
[1:32:02] washing but you must surrender to the
[1:32:05] word that's your choice
[1:32:08] praise God
[1:32:12] I want to read uh Matthew chapter 15.
[1:32:16] together
[1:32:24] Matthew chapter 15.
[1:32:26] foreign
[1:32:32] oh my
[1:32:34] yeah Matthew 15-1
[1:32:38] says then he came to then came Jesus
[1:32:41] came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees
[1:32:43] which were of Jerusalem saying why do
[1:32:45] this disciples transgress the tradition
[1:32:48] of the elders for they washed not their
[1:32:50] hands when they eat bread
[1:32:52] so here come the Pharisees the good old
[1:32:54] Pharisees
[1:32:56] and they were trying to be strict and
[1:32:58] keep all the ordinances and the
[1:33:00] traditions of the fathers to be
[1:33:01] acceptable unto God but the thing is
[1:33:03] where they were completely unaccepted by
[1:33:05] God because they didn't accept God
[1:33:09] they accept traditions and rules and
[1:33:11] they had all kinds of washing pots and
[1:33:13] washing this and rituals and ceremony
[1:33:16] they had all kinds of things that looked
[1:33:18] great with tons of effort that made it
[1:33:20] look clean and made it look holy but
[1:33:21] they were not accepted by God because
[1:33:23] they didn't accept God
[1:33:25] right they were trying to do something
[1:33:27] right so then they start to criticize
[1:33:30] the disciples why do your disciples eat
[1:33:33] with unwashed hands why don't they keep
[1:33:34] the tradition of the fathers and Jesus
[1:33:37] gives them a wonderful answer in verse
[1:33:39] 17.
[1:33:41] he says do not ye yet understand that
[1:33:45] whatsoever entereth in at the mouth
[1:33:47] goeth into the belly and is cast out the
[1:33:50] drawn
[1:33:51] but those things which proceed out of
[1:33:53] the mouth come forth from the heart and
[1:33:55] they defile the man for out of the heart
[1:33:58] perceive evil thoughts murders
[1:34:00] adulteries fornications theft false
[1:34:03] witness blasphemies
[1:34:06] all of a sudden Jesus taught him a very
[1:34:08] valuable lesson
[1:34:10] you're worried about a man defiling
[1:34:12] himself by eating with unwashed hands
[1:34:14] it's not the eating with what not what
[1:34:17] goes into a man that defiles him it's
[1:34:19] what comes out of his heart that defiles
[1:34:21] him
[1:34:22] it's the condition of the heart being
[1:34:24] expressed is what's defiling the man not
[1:34:26] what he's putting in but what's coming
[1:34:28] out amen so God Christ is showing them
[1:34:30] that what you need is a change in your
[1:34:33] heart amen not all of these ordinances
[1:34:35] to try to keep everything outside from
[1:34:38] coming inside you need the thing that
[1:34:40] really defiles a man is the wickedness
[1:34:42] inside coming outside that's what
[1:34:45] defiles it
[1:34:47] amen this is the fallacy of the Holiness
[1:34:50] movement this is the fallacy of any
[1:34:53] legalistic movement the Pharisee
[1:34:55] movement the Holiness movement the the
[1:34:58] fallacy is that we can weaken through
[1:35:01] conduct and Order keep any evil from
[1:35:03] coming in
[1:35:05] and defiling ourselves we dress right
[1:35:07] talk right go to church do all these
[1:35:09] things and and we don't watch anything
[1:35:11] and we don't we don't listen to any bad
[1:35:13] thing we don't do any bad thing we won't
[1:35:15] let any bad thing come in the problem is
[1:35:17] the thing that's defiling you is
[1:35:19] unregenerate hearts
[1:35:21] the thing that's defiling you is not
[1:35:23] being born again the thing that is
[1:35:25] corrupting you is that which is coming
[1:35:26] out of you amen you need the word to
[1:35:29] come in and be a sanctifying process and
[1:35:31] the Holy Ghost to come in and burn out
[1:35:33] all of that and bring you into the
[1:35:36] position the word has for you
[1:35:40] amen
[1:35:42] that's why putting on will never work
[1:35:46] that's why doing will never work amen
[1:35:49] it's got to be his doing our surrender
[1:35:52] to his doing that will come in and bring
[1:35:54] a change on the inside because the
[1:35:57] corruption that is in man is in the
[1:35:58] heart of man
[1:36:01] so I rule keeping won't do it
[1:36:04] but I tell you one thing if the Holy
[1:36:06] Fire of God has burned out the old
[1:36:08] nature and burn out the old men and the
[1:36:10] seed of God has sprung to life amen and
[1:36:12] you become Holiness unto the Lord it'll
[1:36:14] change the way you dress it'll change
[1:36:16] the way you talk it'll change your
[1:36:18] attitudes and that which starts coming
[1:36:19] out of you will not be what defiles you
[1:36:22] but what comes out of you will be the
[1:36:23] very life of God will be coming out of
[1:36:25] your mouth amen when your kindness and
[1:36:27] your sweetness and your temperament
[1:36:29] change and all of these things that are
[1:36:30] taking place is because we've come
[1:36:33] surrendered to the word
[1:36:35] and it washed us and he purified us and
[1:36:38] he burned us and he changed us
[1:36:41] and then when we become Holiness unto
[1:36:44] the Lord
[1:36:46] we will dress holy talk holy walk holy
[1:36:49] think holy
[1:36:52] feel holy you understand
[1:36:55] that's the Holiness we need
[1:37:01] look at one more aspect as we depart as
[1:37:05] we finish in John chapter 17.
[1:37:18] this is the last thing I want to point
[1:37:21] out
[1:37:24] John 17.
[1:37:28] Jesus says John 17 verse 17.
[1:37:32] sanctify them through thy truth
[1:37:35] Thy word is truth
[1:37:37] so what brings sanctification in our
[1:37:39] lives the truth
[1:37:42] what is this message the truth
[1:37:45] what did God bring us the truth
[1:37:47] and what will that truth do to us it'll
[1:37:50] sanctify us
[1:37:51] but it won't sanctify us if we push play
[1:37:54] and don't obey
[1:37:57] it won't sanctify us we just come to
[1:37:58] church and go home and no surrender it
[1:38:01] won't sanctify the washing of the water
[1:38:03] of the word does it wash just because
[1:38:05] these ears heard the word it'll wash
[1:38:08] when these ears hear the word and you
[1:38:10] say that ain't nothing but the truth and
[1:38:12] I'm going to give my life to it
[1:38:15] it takes both parts
[1:38:18] so he says sanctify them through thy
[1:38:20] truth Thy word is truth
[1:38:23] as thou has sent me into the world even
[1:38:25] so have I sent them into the world for
[1:38:29] their sakes I sanctify myself
[1:38:32] this is such an interesting scripture
[1:38:35] for their sakes I sanctify myself that
[1:38:37] they also might be Sanctified through
[1:38:40] the truth
[1:38:41] Jesus is saying for their sakes I
[1:38:43] sanctify myself and the question is did
[1:38:47] Jesus need cleansed
[1:38:49] did he need purified did he need
[1:38:52] perfected what what is Jesus saying for
[1:38:54] their sakes I sanctify myself he's he is
[1:38:58] the holy child he is the Holy One of
[1:39:00] Israel he is the holy God he is the
[1:39:03] Messiah what does he need to sanctify
[1:39:06] himself for
[1:39:07] he's the Holy One does anybody believe
[1:39:09] he's the Holy One of Israel
[1:39:11] then you would think he's already
[1:39:12] sanctified
[1:39:14] but what he's showing he's saying I am
[1:39:17] consecrating myself for their sakes
[1:39:19] and here's what brother Branham said
[1:39:21] about it in adoption he said that's one
[1:39:23] of the sweetest words that I ever heard
[1:39:25] father I sanctify myself for their sakes
[1:39:27] do you know he had a right to have a
[1:39:30] home
[1:39:31] he was a human he would have a right to
[1:39:33] a wife he was a man he had a right to
[1:39:35] all of these things he but he said
[1:39:37] father I sanctify myself for their sakes
[1:39:40] I sanctify myself
[1:39:43] I was talking to a little preacher
[1:39:45] yesterday going to preach for him in a
[1:39:47] few nights up here on the highway and I
[1:39:49] asked him about a certain thing he said
[1:39:51] yes brother Branham but most of my
[1:39:53] people doesn't believe in that
[1:39:57] I said I said most of all of them are
[1:40:00] legalists he said yes
[1:40:03] brother doesn't the brother doesn't
[1:40:05] believe that but he said for their sake
[1:40:08] I oh I wanted to hug his neck for their
[1:40:11] sake I sanctify myself for their sake
[1:40:16] here he's talking about a brother a
[1:40:18] minister and and brother Branham I don't
[1:40:20] know what the conversation was or what
[1:40:22] the challenge was but brother bear says
[1:40:24] he must have questioned why he did
[1:40:27] something and brother bam said he says
[1:40:29] brother most of my people don't believe
[1:40:31] that
[1:40:32] and brother Brenham said they're mostly
[1:40:34] legalist and the man said yes
[1:40:36] so there's there's a man with a
[1:40:38] congregation that congregation is
[1:40:41] struggling to believe something a
[1:40:42] certain way the man doesn't believe it
[1:40:44] that way but he's consecrated himself
[1:40:47] for their sakes
[1:40:49] he Sanctified himself he's dedicated
[1:40:51] himself to something for their sakes not
[1:40:54] even something he needs to do not even
[1:40:55] something he has to do but he did it for
[1:40:58] their sake he's got the right he knows
[1:41:00] the word he can go and do whatever he
[1:41:01] wants he's got the Liberty he's got the
[1:41:03] freedom amen he can go do it but he
[1:41:06] knows that it would challenge the people
[1:41:07] in the crowd they wouldn't understand it
[1:41:09] because of what they believed so he
[1:41:12] sanctifies himself for their sakes and
[1:41:15] brother bear said oh I wanted to hug his
[1:41:17] neck
[1:41:20] said sanctifying myself for there say oh
[1:41:22] Jesus was training 12 men that through
[1:41:25] these 12 men was to take the gospel to
[1:41:27] the world and he said for their sake I
[1:41:29] sanctify myself make make yourself for
[1:41:32] your neighbor's sake for somebody else
[1:41:34] to say don't use your Liberty for a
[1:41:36] cloak said Paul but sanctify yourself
[1:41:38] behave yourself in the neighborhood like
[1:41:40] a real Christian ought to let your
[1:41:42] communication if you meet your enemy
[1:41:44] sanctify yourself for his sake not
[1:41:46] knowing what you might do
[1:41:49] he goes on in Fellowship he says I think
[1:41:51] the sweetest scripture there is in all
[1:41:53] the Bibles this scripture father I
[1:41:55] sanctify myself because of them
[1:41:57] he was a man he could have had a wife he
[1:42:00] was a man he could have had a home a
[1:42:02] place to lay his head he had a right to
[1:42:04] that he was a man he could have had good
[1:42:06] clothes he was a man but what did he say
[1:42:09] father I sanctify myself for their sake
[1:42:12] what was he doing he was training up 12
[1:42:14] disciples that were going to preach the
[1:42:16] gospel in all the world he put on an
[1:42:18] example and Brethren as ministers I tell
[1:42:21] you it pays us not to get too much of
[1:42:22] the world's goods and things hanging
[1:42:24] around us you preachers I'm talking to
[1:42:26] sanctify yourselves for them that you're
[1:42:28] going to lead that's what we need today
[1:42:31] is a complete consecrated Sanctified
[1:42:34] life of ministers that walk upright
[1:42:37] before God does not entangle with the
[1:42:39] things of the world keep away from it
[1:42:41] father I sanctify myself for their sake
[1:42:43] for not because he had to do it but he
[1:42:46] did it for their sake
[1:42:49] can we do that for each other
[1:42:51] we can do that for the neighbor can we
[1:42:53] do that for the enemy can we do that for
[1:42:55] whoever he it wasn't that he was trying
[1:42:58] to obtain something it's not always that
[1:43:00] we have to get something from God or our
[1:43:02] reward from God sometimes we just keep
[1:43:05] ourselves in a certain place for the
[1:43:07] benefit of somebody else
[1:43:09] keep ourselves consecrated to God in a
[1:43:11] certain thing for somebody else's
[1:43:13] benefit for somebody else's welfare
[1:43:15] that's what Jesus did
[1:43:18] he didn't need to be purified he was the
[1:43:20] Holy One but he needed to keep himself
[1:43:22] consecrated and dedicated in a certain
[1:43:24] way for the ones that we're around him
[1:43:27] did he have Liberty yes are we a free
[1:43:29] people we're a free people
[1:43:31] will God cast us away amen with every
[1:43:33] mistake no he won't cast us away we have
[1:43:35] Liberty we have Liberty but let's not
[1:43:37] use Liberty as a cloak for maliciousness
[1:43:39] or selfishness
[1:43:41] but let's keep ourselves dedicated to
[1:43:44] the word keep ourselves dedicated to the
[1:43:47] Lord and to one another
[1:43:49] for each other's sake
[1:43:53] I'm going to read one more scripture
[1:43:54] Hebrews chapter 2.
[1:44:01] musicians you can go ahead and start
[1:44:03] making your way up
[1:44:07] Hebrews chapter 2 verse 10.
[1:44:13] for it became him for whom are all
[1:44:16] things and by whom are all things and
[1:44:18] bring many sons unto glory to make the
[1:44:21] captain of their salvation perfect
[1:44:22] through suffering for both he that
[1:44:25] sanctifieth and they who are Sanctified
[1:44:28] are all of One
[1:44:30] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[1:44:32] call them brethren
[1:44:35] the one who's doing the sanctifying and
[1:44:38] the one who's being Sanctified are all
[1:44:40] of One
[1:44:42] whatever he is I am
[1:44:45] he's the bridegroom I'm the bride he's
[1:44:47] the word I'm the word the thing that's
[1:44:50] sanctifying and Mead who's being
[1:44:52] Sanctified are all one
[1:44:55] he has called us to our position in this
[1:44:58] day to be the bride and he's called us
[1:45:01] to be a holy bride
[1:45:04] a bride that set apart unto him
[1:45:07] what does it mean to be holy to be
[1:45:09] consecrated and set apart for the word
[1:45:13] to be dedicated and separated to the
[1:45:16] word
[1:45:17] that's what it means to be holy let's
[1:45:19] all stand
[1:45:25] Holiness is not necessarily to make
[1:45:27] ourselves perfect or pure through
[1:45:29] actions Deeds or restraints
[1:45:32] but to be holy unto the Lord means that
[1:45:34] we're chosen by God
[1:45:37] that he has called us
[1:45:40] and that we have surrendered to that and
[1:45:43] subjected ourselves to his word
[1:45:46] to be holy is to be wholly consecrated
[1:45:50] to the Lord
[1:45:53] amen can I do that and make a mistake
[1:45:55] you can do that and make a mistake can
[1:45:58] you be holy and still not have
[1:45:59] everything in your right set aside set
[1:46:01] up set right because you're still
[1:46:03] learning yes you can be holy and still
[1:46:06] learning
[1:46:07] like Israel was like the first church
[1:46:09] was you can be holy and still growing in
[1:46:11] your knowledge of the Lord and still be
[1:46:13] holy
[1:46:14] holy is not something you're going to
[1:46:15] come to someday holy is a position God's
[1:46:18] put you in and your surrender to that
[1:46:20] position
[1:46:21] and I said God help me to be consecrated
[1:46:24] to this word and to be holy unto the
[1:46:28] Lord
[1:46:29] amen
[1:46:30] God bless you

[1:46:54] preach Lord I pray you fill all gaps
[1:46:57] Lord and you correct any wrongs I pray
[1:47:00] you would plant in the heart of your
[1:47:01] children the correct understanding
[1:47:04] God that we wouldn't take old
[1:47:05] denominational ideas but we would look
[1:47:07] at your word
[1:47:09] what your Prophet has brought in this
[1:47:11] day what you've made us to be
[1:47:13] God may we understand what it is you
[1:47:15] want from our lives what it is you're
[1:47:18] looking for in US
[1:47:19] and may we give it to you Lord
[1:47:22] God I believe above all you're looking
[1:47:25] for a surrendered heart
[1:47:27] you're looking for someone that you have
[1:47:29] called
[1:47:31] who will surrender their life and lay
[1:47:33] down all thoughts and all ideas
[1:47:36] and come to that word
[1:47:38] to submit to it and to obey it God I
[1:47:42] want to be that kind of person
[1:47:44] I pray Lord that you would wash Us by
[1:47:46] the washing of the water of your word
[1:47:48] and separate us from all the wrong
[1:47:50] understanding and wrong desires that
[1:47:53] have plagued us all these years
[1:47:55] and go on through the revelation of your
[1:47:57] word that you would purchase from those
[1:47:59] things and that we would always have a
[1:48:02] desire Lord to surrender to everything
[1:48:04] that you show us
[1:48:06] and that we can be consecrated and
[1:48:08] dedicated unto you that you who have
[1:48:11] called us to Consecration and dedication
[1:48:13] will help us Lord
[1:48:16] we want to be holy unto you
[1:48:18] God I pray you bless your people that
[1:48:21] you would guide us that you would watch
[1:48:22] over us that you would protect us and
[1:48:24] use us for your glory in Jesus Christ's
[1:48:28] name we pray
[1:48:29] amen
[1:48:31] amen God bless you all

[1:50:29] [Music]
[1:50:30] God has always called his people to be
[1:50:33] holy
[1:50:35] God call the holy people to make a holy
[1:50:38] Temple and the holy God wouldn't dwell
[1:50:41] among them what made them holy was his
[1:50:43] choice and his presence
[1:50:46] when they chose not to go his way
[1:50:48] anymore he left his presence left and he
[1:50:50] let them go into bondage and let the
[1:50:52] temple be destroyed because it wasn't
[1:50:54] holy because of the fabric it wasn't
[1:50:56] holy because of the gold it was holy
[1:50:59] because of his selection his choosing
[1:51:01] his purpose and his presence foreign
[1:51:04] said it wasn't the Holy Mountain it was
[1:51:06] the holy God on the mountain that made
[1:51:08] it holy
[1:51:09] when Moses came to Jesus at a burning
[1:51:12] bush to take off your shoes for the
[1:51:14] ground you stand on his Holy Ground it
[1:51:17] wasn't the sand it wasn't the dirt it
[1:51:19] was the presence of God it was the place
[1:51:21] God chose
[1:51:24] and we by a revelation of the word in
[1:51:27] this day we can say we are a holy people
[1:51:30] we can say it without shame you can say
[1:51:33] it looking in the mirror you can say it
[1:51:35] knowing that there's some things in your
[1:51:36] life you wish were better there's some
[1:51:38] things you want to grow in but you can
[1:51:40] still to say we are a holy people not by
[1:51:43] my choice but by his choice
[1:51:45] we're a holy people because he called us
[1:51:47] to be a holy people and he's given us a
[1:51:49] word that'll sanctify and cleanse us and
[1:51:52] his presence is in his bride making it a
[1:51:55] holy people
[1:51:57] amen once you know that you're a holy
[1:52:01] vessel
[1:52:02] when you know it when you know that God
[1:52:05] has called you that God has washed you
[1:52:07] and that God is dwelling in you and you
[1:52:09] know that it's his intention for you and
[1:52:11] you surrender to that amen you may have
[1:52:14] a whole list of things that you wish
[1:52:16] were better and you may have a whole
[1:52:17] idea about how you'd like to change
[1:52:19] yourself but it doesn't change the fact
[1:52:21] you're a holy person
[1:52:23] [Music]
[1:52:24] and when you come to that realization I
[1:52:27] tell you friends it changes the way we
[1:52:29] live
[1:52:29] it changes the way we think it changes
[1:52:32] the decisions we make amen we need to
[1:52:34] realize what God has done for us in this
[1:52:36] day and where he's at who he is who we
[1:52:39] are and we can claim we can say by the
[1:52:43] grace of God I am a holy person
[1:52:47] God's called me to this position
[1:52:50] God's washed me in his word I with all
[1:52:54] that's in my heart surrendered to that
[1:52:56] and he has filled me with this spirit I
[1:52:59] am a holy person
[1:53:02] we are by God's grace a holy bride
[1:53:06] why does a holy person want to go act
[1:53:09] Unholy you don't once you realize you're
[1:53:11] a holy person
[1:53:13] and why does a holy person trying to be
[1:53:15] holy you're just a holy person
[1:53:18] not because we climb the ladder we
[1:53:21] outdid the Pharisees he chose us
[1:53:24] it was so simple he called I responded
[1:53:28] he did the rest
[1:53:30] and now because of that I want to
[1:53:34] consecrate myself for this purpose I
[1:53:37] want to dedicate myself to this purpose
[1:53:39] though I may have some Liberties and I
[1:53:41] may but I don't want to do anything that
[1:53:43] paints the wrong picture to anybody else
[1:53:45] I now consecrate myself to be a holy
[1:53:47] person
[1:53:48] for my neighbor for my co-worker for my
[1:53:51] brothers and sisters that's our desire
[1:53:54] oh what God has done for us is

[1:57:23] wonderful to be here to observe this but
[1:57:26] it's wonderful for sister Tammy and
[1:57:28] brother Alan
[1:57:29] I had a chance to sit and talk with them
[1:57:31] yesterday and hear their story and what
[1:57:33] God's doing for them and it's just
[1:57:35] remarkable I just thank God how God
[1:57:38] knows how to reach down
[1:57:40] and find his seed and grab them and pull
[1:57:42] them to himself
[1:57:44] and then he hasn't quit searching amen
[1:57:47] he hasn't quit finding he hasn't quit
[1:57:49] calling so this is just a remarkable
[1:57:51] time they've been fellowshipping here
[1:57:53] with us for three or four months and the
[1:57:55] Lord just let them they've came and
[1:57:58] they've had questions they've had uh
[1:58:01] they wanted to know where God want them
[1:58:03] but God supernaturally has used brother
[1:58:07] Benjamin siebel and others in the
[1:58:08] assembly to to confirm where he wants
[1:58:11] them to be that they're on the right
[1:58:13] track and they know that the next step
[1:58:15] in their journey is baptism in the name
[1:58:17] of the Lord Jesus Christ and so they're
[1:58:19] going to be obedient to the word of God
[1:58:21] and how many of you will pray for this
[1:58:23] couple that God will fill them with his
[1:58:25] Spirit according to his promise and lead
[1:58:26] them every step in his perfect will amen
[1:58:31] sister Tammy because you want to be
[1:58:33] identified with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:58:35] and his death burial and resurrection
[1:58:37] and you've accepted his call for your
[1:58:39] life it's with joy I baptize you in the
[1:58:42] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:58:44] okay
[1:58:46] dear Lord Jesus I thank you Father for
[1:58:49] my sister I thank you God that you've
[1:58:52] called her Lord by your own calling by
[1:58:54] your own choosing by your own way you've
[1:58:57] made it personal and you made it
[1:58:58] specific for her
[1:59:00] and God she has obeyed your word in
[1:59:02] being baptized in your name and I pray
[1:59:05] God that you would keep your word in her
[1:59:07] life for you've promised Lord if she
[1:59:09] would repent and be baptized in the name
[1:59:11] of the Lord Jesus Christ that she shall
[1:59:14] be filled with the Holy Ghost I pray to
[1:59:16] fill her Lord let her light life be a
[1:59:19] light to the world and that shines forth
[1:59:21] from this vessel For Your Glory in Jesus
[1:59:24] name we pray amen
[1:59:26] unless you hold on to the ramp
[1:59:29] and now we have brother Alan
[1:59:33] God bless you brother
[1:59:37] the testimony is so amazing

[1:59:57] and years they just went on like that
[1:59:59] but when God's appointed time came God
[2:00:03] knows exactly where we're at amen we've
[2:00:05] never been lost God never lost track of
[2:00:08] us he knew where we were and so we were
[2:00:10] talking yesterday it was just
[2:00:12] interesting that he's never known the
[2:00:14] message never even raised in church and
[2:00:16] when God got a hold of me just got a
[2:00:18] hold of him and led him in this path and
[2:00:20] I asked sister Tammy I said what have
[2:00:23] you ever thought as a growing up as you
[2:00:26] know ever thought back to those years of
[2:00:28] the message and the truth and not going
[2:00:30] to church or doing anything and she says
[2:00:33] inside I always knew I would come back
[2:00:37] amen how is it that the seed always
[2:00:40] knows amen no matter where life is going
[2:00:43] and it was going to be her husband that
[2:00:45] was going to lead her back amen God is
[2:00:47] so good and so faithful we can rejoice
[2:00:50] in what he's done right here
[2:00:52] amen God bless you brother Allen because
