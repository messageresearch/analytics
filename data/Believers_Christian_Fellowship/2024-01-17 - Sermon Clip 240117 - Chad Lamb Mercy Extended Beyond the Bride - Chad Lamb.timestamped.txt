[0:00] so when we come to the white Throne
[0:04] judgment let's just do it this way let's
[0:08] just say we have a
[0:10] throne Before the
[0:13] Throne there's two sections because he's
[0:16] going to separate
[0:18] them as sheep I want to read this and
[0:21] make sure I get right CU if I draw it
[0:22] wrong I'm going to be in trouble okay
[0:25] the sheep on his right hand and the
[0:26] goats on his left so he would be facing
[0:30] them this would be the
[0:32] righteous on his right
[0:35] hand so over here you've got all these
[0:40] people multitudes of people over here
[0:43] you got multitudes of
[0:45] people so when you look at this it looks
[0:49] like you have these that will be
[0:53] eternally
[0:58] lost
[1:00] and then you have the
[1:03] King on the throne and you say well
[1:06] we've got three categories of people but
[1:09] actually according to scripture we have
[1:10] four categories of people because the
[1:13] king is not alone on the throne beside
[1:16] the king is the
[1:20] queen GL amen when Jesus begins to speak
[1:25] here in the parable he says unto them
[1:28] verse 34 then shall the king say that's
[1:31] one
[1:32] person to them on his right hand to the
[1:35] to the righteous come you blessed of my
[1:37] father inherit the Kingdom prepared for
[1:39] you from the foundation of the world and
[1:40] we know he speaks to the ones on the
[1:42] left hand those that will be lost and he
[1:44] tells them they didn't take care of him
[1:45] they didn't look after him they didn't
[1:47] serve him so that's we got the ones on
[1:49] the right the ones on the left and the
[1:51] King on the throne but listen to what he
[1:53] says he says I was hungered and he
[1:56] starts to say I was hungered I was naked
[1:58] you clothed me I was was in prison you
[2:00] visited me and they
[2:04] asked uh then they then they asked uh in
[2:08] verse 38 I mean verse 37 then shall the
[2:11] righteous answer him saying Lord when
[2:13] saw we thee a hungered and fed thee and
[2:15] thirsty and gave the drink when they
[2:17] didn't even know when they did it
[2:19] they're standing here looking at the
[2:20] king and he's saying you fed me you
[2:23] clothed me you visited me you you served
[2:26] me and they said Lord when they they
[2:29] never saw that figure they never served
[2:32] that figure if you understand what I'm
[2:34] saying they they're confused about how
[2:37] they fed him and how they clothed him
[2:39] and how they visited him but then he
[2:41] makes a statement he and he says and the
[2:43] King shall answer verse 40 and the King
[2:45] shall answer and say unto them verily I
[2:47] say unto you as much as you have done it
[2:49] unto one of the least of these my
[2:52] brethren you have done unto me that's
[2:54] the fourth group that's the mystery
[2:56] group at the white Throne judgment
[2:58] everybody else is is uh uh defined and
[3:01] easily said the one on the right the one
[3:03] on the left and the King on the throne
[3:04] but he reveals a mystery group at the
[3:07] white Throne judgment he says when you
[3:09] have done it to these these my brethren
[3:12] that are sitting here on the throne with
[3:15] me then you did it unto
[3:18] me oh it's always been the mystery group
[3:21] the bride's been the mystery through the
[3:23] whole Bible she's been the mystery group
[3:25] and still in the white Throne judgment
[3:27] she's the mystery group but a prophet is
[3:29] coming and revealed the
[3:31] mystery who this mystery group is it's
[3:34] the bride and she is judging with the
[3:37] King
