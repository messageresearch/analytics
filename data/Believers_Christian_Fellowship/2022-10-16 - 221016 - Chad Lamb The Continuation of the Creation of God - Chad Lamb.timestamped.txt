[18:37] you in Jesus Christ's name amen
[18:40] and God bless you while we're standing
[18:42] let's turn to Second Corinthians
[18:44] chapter 5
[18:49] verse 17.
[18:53] second Corinthians chapter 5.
[18:57] and verse 17.
[19:03] all right I'll begin reading second
[19:05] Corinthians 5 and 17. therefore If any
[19:07] man be in Christ
[19:09] he is a new creature old things are
[19:12] passed away behold all things are become
[19:16] new man God bless you as you're seated
[19:18] and we want to thank God for his word as
[19:22] was mentioned earlier remember brother
[19:24] Manuel sister Mimi they're leaving this
[19:26] morning to head to Congo and so they'll
[19:29] be there 12 days also Brother Joseph
[19:31] Scott and I will be leaving this
[19:32] afternoon for India we fly out of
[19:34] Detroit this evening and we'll be gone
[19:36] for 12 days we'll be back on the 28th so
[19:39] we appreciate you praying for us
[19:42] I spoke with brother rashan brother
[19:45] Rashon sent me the Ministry schedule I
[19:46] was gone and I thought the brother loved
[19:49] me but after I saw how many servers he
[19:50] scheduled I I don't know anymore if he
[19:52] loves me or not but he scheduled eight
[19:54] services for us to preach while we're
[19:56] gone so I'll be in special prayer and
[19:58] especially for one of them he's having
[20:01] special meetings in his hometown
[20:04] um the Tuesday before I come home I
[20:06] don't remember the date not this Tuesday
[20:08] but next Tuesday
[20:09] and he's having two services and is down
[20:13] and he's invited everyone he's got
[20:16] posters all over he sent me pictures of
[20:18] posters all over the town and a big
[20:20] billboard announcing the meetings and
[20:21] they're inviting all the denominational
[20:23] Christians in the area and they want to
[20:25] have Outreach meetings so if you could
[20:27] be in particular prayer that God would
[20:29] just give me a special anointing and
[20:30] inspiration for that service that we can
[20:33] present the word and present light in a
[20:36] way that it'll catch the seed of God
[20:38] Amen so while I'm gone the Ministry
[20:41] schedule Brother Kyle Weichert will be
[20:43] taking this coming Wednesday the 19th
[20:45] brother Nathaniel science will be coming
[20:47] down and preaching for us on Sunday the
[20:49] 23rd and then I asked brother Noel
[20:52] Johnson if he would come up and preach
[20:53] for us on the 26th because brother Noel
[20:55] is so active in India I thought it'd be
[20:58] nice if he came here and ministered
[20:59] while I went to India it's like teamwork
[21:02] you know so and I asked brother no I
[21:05] said do you have any tips or any advice
[21:06] for me and he was sharing some things
[21:08] and he says you know you're going to
[21:10] Punjab it's a nice area it's the seat of
[21:13] the Sikh religion and most of the
[21:15] majority are Sikhs and he said they're
[21:17] very nice very friendly they'll treat
[21:19] you really good but if you speak against
[21:21] the religion you may not come home
[21:25] that is a good tip
[21:28] he said they they they protect the
[21:32] quality and religion they believe all
[21:33] Faith are valuable they're really nice
[21:35] friendly people but they're mandated to
[21:37] kill you if you speak against the
[21:39] religion and they and the The Devout
[21:41] seeks all carry a dagger with them
[21:44] to back up the I guess the threat I
[21:47] don't know so I'm going to start every
[21:48] sermon with I love Sikh people and and I
[21:52] love the seek religions and anything I
[21:54] say after this just referred to my
[21:56] opening statement so just pray for us
[21:58] that was a good tip from Brother Noel so
[22:00] we'll be we'll be cautious also I want
[22:03] to thank everybody who came out
[22:04] yesterday for the work day and for the
[22:06] trustee brothers who organized that they
[22:08] got a lot of work done in just half of a
[22:10] day so we appreciate all your brothers
[22:12] thankful for the trustees wives Who
[22:14] provided a lunch for everybody that was
[22:16] working and they got several things then
[22:18] they were able to line wash the brick
[22:19] and touch it up over here on the
[22:21] fellowship hall they fixed some parking
[22:24] lot lights they cut out and formed a new
[22:26] sidewalk to the Pavilion that is going
[22:28] to be very useful and very helpful
[22:29] they'll be pouring the concrete in that
[22:31] in a few weeks and they started this
[22:35] Nursery project to expand the nursing
[22:37] mother's Nursery into part of the
[22:41] library so they walled off part of the
[22:43] library because we have of we are
[22:45] blessed with babies and we need more
[22:47] space for the babies so they started
[22:50] that project that should be done in a
[22:51] couple weeks they had various other con
[22:53] projects like cleaning gutters picking
[22:55] up around power washing so they did a
[22:57] great job and I'm always amazed at how
[23:00] much skill and labor is within the
[23:02] assembly and and how much gets done in a
[23:05] short amount of time when everybody
[23:06] comes together so God bless you and
[23:08] thank you your labor was a blessing to
[23:10] us all
[23:11] amen well this morning I want to I want
[23:14] to look at this scripture
[23:16] and I want to take for a thought the
[23:19] continuation of the creation of God
[23:22] so for a title the continuation of the
[23:25] creation of God we just read in second
[23:28] Corinthians 5 17 that if any man be in
[23:32] Christ he is a new creature
[23:36] old things are passed away and and you
[23:39] may feel like in some ways you still
[23:41] deal with the old nature of some old
[23:43] Hamlet some old family trades but in the
[23:45] eyes of God you're a new creature and
[23:47] the old things have passed away and for
[23:50] God you've changed you've changed from
[23:52] the old into the new and you're
[23:54] literally a new creature a new creation
[23:56] old things are passed away and behold
[23:59] all things are become new
[24:02] brother Venom he says in the laodicean
[24:04] church age I've got several scriptures I
[24:07] want to go to so keep your Bibles handy
[24:08] and I got several quotes I want to read
[24:10] so stay with me we'll try to make it
[24:12] quick as possible but but there's so
[24:15] much that the prophet of God said on
[24:17] this subject to begin to stir my heart
[24:19] and out of the church age book he says
[24:22] this but now he is standing in the midst
[24:24] of the church as he stands there
[24:26] revealing who he is in the last age he
[24:29] calls himself the author of the creation
[24:31] of God the beginning of the creation of
[24:33] God he says there in Revelation chapter
[24:35] 3.
[24:36] and brother bam tells us that he's the
[24:39] author because God is the author of the
[24:42] creation
[24:43] and then he begins to speak about the
[24:46] church he says this is another creation
[24:48] this has to do with the church this is a
[24:51] special designation of himself he is the
[24:54] creator of that church the Heavenly
[24:56] bridegroom created his own Bride As the
[24:59] spirit of God he came down and created
[25:01] in the Virgin Mary the cells from which
[25:03] his body was born so we know that the
[25:06] creator of the Bride is not the bride
[25:11] but he created the Heavenly bridegroom
[25:13] has created his own bride amen and so he
[25:17] is the he is the author of the creation
[25:19] of God he's the beginning of the
[25:21] creation of God and he's the creator of
[25:23] the creation of God and that bride is
[25:26] his creation
[25:28] he goes on he says Mary was a human
[25:31] incubator and she carried that holy
[25:32] child and brought him to birth it was a
[25:35] God man he was the son of God he was of
[25:38] the new creation man and God met and
[25:42] joined he was the first of this new race
[25:45] he is the head of this new race so this
[25:48] new creation is not the old creation
[25:51] that had been perverted but this new
[25:53] creation which Jesus Christ becomes the
[25:55] first of he was born without human
[25:58] intervention so he was born free from
[26:00] the perversion of hybridization amen but
[26:03] but what made it the new creation was
[26:05] not that he just come forth virgin born
[26:07] but that God himself United with this
[26:11] creation making this his body his
[26:14] created body and this makes it a new
[26:16] race amen and he becomes the head of
[26:20] this new race
[26:21] really important to understand because
[26:24] he's the head of the new race that means
[26:26] there must be more of this new race and
[26:29] so the in order to be part of this new
[26:31] race you have to be able to escape
[26:32] Corruption of hybridization amen and you
[26:35] have to be a new creature so how do we
[26:37] become a new creation separated from the
[26:40] old where the old passes away we're part
[26:42] of the new and can become part of this
[26:44] new race our new creation it's done by
[26:47] the New Birth by being united with Jesus
[26:50] Christ amen
[26:51] in Colossians 1 18 He says and he is the
[26:54] head of the body the church who is the
[26:56] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[26:58] that in all things he might have the
[27:01] preeminence so there you can see that
[27:04] though man was of the old order or
[27:06] creation Now in Union with Christ he has
[27:09] become the new creation of God
[27:13] any any quotes Ephesians 4 24 here and
[27:17] that you may put on the new man
[27:20] which after God has created in
[27:21] righteousness and true Holiness let's
[27:23] turn to this together Ephesians 4. if
[27:25] you can turn with me
[27:30] Ephesians 4 and 24.
[27:39] let's start with verse 22.
[27:41] Ephesians 4 and 22 that you put off
[27:44] concerning the former conversation the
[27:46] old man which is corrupt according to
[27:49] the deceitful lust and be renewed in the
[27:52] spirit of your mind and that ye put on
[27:55] the new man which after God is created
[27:58] in righteousness and true Holiness this
[28:01] new man is made after God It's Made In
[28:03] God's fashion It's Made In God's
[28:05] likeness amen which is created in
[28:07] righteousness and true Holiness so
[28:11] that's that's the goal he goes on back
[28:13] back in the church age quote he says
[28:15] this new creation is not the old
[28:17] creation made over or it would not be
[28:20] called a new creation this is exactly
[28:23] what it says it is New Creation it is
[28:25] another creation distinct from the old
[28:27] one no longer is he dealing by ways of
[28:30] the flesh that was how he dealt with
[28:32] Israel he chose Abraham and of Abraham's
[28:35] issue Through The Godly Isaac line but
[28:38] now out of every Kindred tribe and
[28:40] Nation he has purposed a new creation he
[28:43] is the first of that creation he was God
[28:46] created in the form of man now by his
[28:50] Spirit he is creating many sons unto
[28:53] himself he was the head of the race now
[28:55] he's creating the rest of the race by
[28:58] uniting with Man by uniting with man
[29:00] through the new birth amen
[29:03] he says Now by his Spirit he's creating
[29:06] many sons unto himself God the Creator
[29:09] creating himself a part of his creation
[29:15] this is the true revelation of God
[29:19] this was his purpose this purpose took
[29:22] form through election
[29:25] what an outstanding quote he says he
[29:28] tells us that he was God created in the
[29:30] form of man that's what he did with
[29:32] Jesus Christ when he United with Jesus
[29:35] Christ he made his own body to dwell and
[29:38] then he came and he dwelled that body
[29:39] and United with him making him the head
[29:42] of the new creation and God he was God
[29:46] created in the form of man now by his
[29:48] Spirit he created many sons unto himself
[29:51] through the new birth through Union with
[29:52] Christ God the Creator creating himself
[29:55] a part of his creation amen now we've
[29:58] got to get Beyond just us and just what
[30:01] we are this is something that God is
[30:03] doing God is creating himself part of
[30:06] his creation
[30:07] this is the true revelation of God
[30:11] this was his purpose
[30:13] let's turn to First Timothy 3 16.
[30:23] this statement will develop as we go
[30:26] and it'll become clearer and clearer as
[30:28] we move on
[30:30] in first Timothy 3 16 it says and
[30:32] without controversy great is the mystery
[30:34] of God in this
[30:35] God was manifest In the Flesh justifying
[30:39] the spirit scene of angels preached unto
[30:41] the Gentiles believed on in the world
[30:43] received up into Glory now initially
[30:47] when we read this we think all of this
[30:49] was accomplished in Jesus Christ amen in
[30:52] his coming here 2 000 years ago but you
[30:55] see it says he was God was God was
[30:59] manifest In the Flesh this is all about
[31:00] God God was manifesting the flesh scene
[31:03] of angels preached unto the Gentiles
[31:06] when God was here in the flesh of Jesus
[31:08] Christ he wasn't preached unto the
[31:10] Gentiles he told his disciples don't go
[31:13] into the Gentiles but only go into the
[31:15] lost sheep of Israel amen and then after
[31:18] his resurrection he told his disciples
[31:20] that I will be with you always even to
[31:22] the end of the world and he was telling
[31:24] them that I was in the comforter I will
[31:26] come unto you I will Unite with you and
[31:28] be in you and then he tells them go into
[31:30] all nations and preach the gospel to All
[31:32] Peoples amen so this mystery of God this
[31:36] when God was manifesting the flesh
[31:38] justified in the spirit seeing of angels
[31:40] preached unto the Gentiles that
[31:42] preaching was through his bride
[31:46] believed on in the world that's
[31:48] continuing on and received up into the
[31:50] glory this is the mystery of godliness
[31:53] this is the work of God and God is
[31:55] continually unfolding himself through
[31:58] his new creation he's continually
[32:00] working Amen in this scripture
[32:03] encompasses amen him coming in flesh and
[32:05] Jesus Christ but it also encompasses him
[32:08] uniting with you and I as the new
[32:10] creation Amen in continuing the work
[32:15] amen
[32:17] and the restoration of the Bride tree
[32:19] says otherwise you're going to form
[32:21] what's known to me as a bride I'll go
[32:24] with you and you will be part of me
[32:26] you'll be my bride my life will be in
[32:28] your body just like a husband and wife
[32:31] is one person you and I are going to be
[32:33] one at that day you'll know that I am in
[32:36] the Father the father and me I in you
[32:39] and you and me oh I just love that Satan
[32:42] just gets so angry at that see the
[32:44] Oneness of God all that God was he
[32:47] poured into Christ all that Christ was
[32:49] he's poured into the church there you
[32:51] are makes them all one
[32:55] so we realized the true revelation of
[32:58] God Amen and encompasses all the
[33:01] attributes of God it encompasses the
[33:03] entire family of God so the true
[33:06] revelation of God must Encompass if you
[33:08] and I are expressed attributes of God
[33:11] Amen if we are parts of him sieging of
[33:13] him that has become to be expressed in
[33:15] this day then the true revelation of God
[33:17] must contain the attributes of God which
[33:20] must contain you and I
[33:23] so here we are as part of the unfolding
[33:26] of God of the mystery of God and part of
[33:29] the true revelation of God if we've been
[33:32] made a new creature in Christ Jesus
[33:35] and the message proving his word oh no
[33:38] I'm sorry I want to read Ephesians 1
[33:40] first before we go to that quote
[33:42] Ephesians 1
[33:46] and 22.
[33:51] Ephesians 1 and 22 and hath put all
[33:54] things under his feet and gave him to be
[33:57] the head over all things to the church
[34:00] which is his body
[34:03] what is his body the church
[34:06] he's the head the church is his body he
[34:08] made all things it made to be head over
[34:11] all things to the church which is his
[34:13] body the fullness of him that filleth
[34:15] all in all so what has the body become
[34:18] in this day the body amen has become the
[34:21] fullness of him that filleth all and all
[34:23] amen who is that this is the mystery of
[34:25] godliness
[34:27] it is going on now there is a revelation
[34:30] of God there is a revelation of the
[34:31] godhead amen there is a mystery that's
[34:34] still unfolding because Christ is now
[34:36] the head of the new race his body is
[34:39] that new race the head is united with
[34:41] the body now he's poured everything into
[34:44] the body the body has become the
[34:46] fullness of him that filleth all in all
[34:49] the body is to be the expression of
[34:51] Jesus Christ on Earth amen it's amazing
[34:55] that God created his own body and he
[34:58] created his own body in in Christ Jesus
[35:01] and he dwelt in that body amen and that
[35:03] was the beginning of the creation of God
[35:05] and when God was dwelling in that body
[35:07] he was manifesting the sun was
[35:09] manifesting or declaring the father to
[35:12] everyone it was he says he says it's not
[35:14] me that does the works it's the father
[35:15] that dwelleth in me he doeth the works
[35:18] he was he was declaring amen the father
[35:22] and all that God was he poured into
[35:24] Christ but all that was Christ was he
[35:26] poured into the church because Christ is
[35:29] God's body amen but the church is
[35:32] Christ's body
[35:34] so the the God the Father poured unto
[35:36] Christ everything he was he poured into
[35:38] Christ that's his body but Christ just
[35:41] like Adam had to have a further
[35:43] expression of his body because male and
[35:46] female made up Adam and Adam was
[35:48] expressed in a male body and a female
[35:51] body and he created the male and female
[35:53] and called their name Adam they were the
[35:56] body of Adam amen because it was Adam's
[35:59] spirit that was broken split and portion
[36:01] of that was put in female so that was
[36:04] the body that contained Adam
[36:06] the male was the body that contained
[36:09] Adam it was all one time in a singular
[36:11] vessel of flesh called Adam amen but
[36:14] within Adam was male and female and God
[36:17] was going to give a further expression
[36:19] of his great desire and he was going to
[36:21] take from Adam the elements to create
[36:23] another vessel and in that other vessel
[36:26] he would take part of Adam's spirit and
[36:28] put in that other vessel so that other
[36:30] vessel would also be the body of Adam
[36:34] and that's the same thing he's done with
[36:36] the bride in this day amen all of it was
[36:39] in the last Adam amen but he took out of
[36:41] him the elements to create his body his
[36:44] bride and she's now a tabernacle of the
[36:47] spirit that was in Christ making it the
[36:50] body of Christ and all that God was he
[36:52] poured into Christ and all that Christ
[36:54] is he's poured into his body the church
[36:57] the bride
[36:58] so that she might be the fullness of him
[37:01] that filleth all
[37:03] in awe
[37:05] praise be to God
[37:07] now we realize
[37:09] when we begin to speak like this
[37:12] the whole point of remember reminding
[37:16] ourselves of these truths the things
[37:17] that the prophet God the whole point of
[37:19] coming continually to be reminded of
[37:21] this is so that we won't go back to old
[37:25] dead things that we won't return back to
[37:27] Old life that we won't allow the old
[37:29] Cardinal nature that's still hanging
[37:30] around to drag us back amen because we
[37:34] know that there's a much higher calling
[37:36] for our existence than to live the old
[37:38] life or to live the American dream or to
[37:40] live the life of everybody around us
[37:42] lives but we have been called to a new
[37:44] purpose a new race a new creation amen
[37:47] and we are here to declare Christ we are
[37:49] here to manifest God
[37:52] and we have to constantly be reminded of
[37:55] that because we're still Amen in this
[37:57] old Fallen state with a sticky cucumber
[37:59] nature amen and it wants to pick up on
[38:02] these old things and we got to
[38:03] constantly come to with within earshot
[38:06] of one another and remind one another
[38:08] provoking one another to love and good
[38:10] works and say don't pick up those dead
[38:12] things that'll burn there's a different
[38:14] purpose for our life we've been called
[38:16] for a different reason we're manifesting
[38:18] something other than the American dream
[38:20] we're manifesting something other than
[38:22] our own pride and arrogant Ambitions
[38:24] amen we need to lose ambition and be
[38:27] ambitious about the word
[38:29] we need to lose self-desire more and
[38:32] more and ambition and a desire to be
[38:34] somebody and Achieve something those
[38:36] things need to fall to the Wayside
[38:38] because the greatest achievement that
[38:40] will ever have is when we surrender and
[38:42] allow the spirit of God to take absolute
[38:45] dominion and control in us and to
[38:47] manifest Christ in the flesh of his body
[38:49] the bride
[38:51] and it'll happen through normal life
[38:53] it'll happen through work and through
[38:55] family and through working and cleaning
[38:58] your yard and all the trivial things of
[39:00] life will still be a manifestation of
[39:02] Christ if we let the spirit of God dwell
[39:04] within us without inhibition
[39:09] and we have to constantly be reminded of
[39:11] these things
[39:12] we get so bogged down with life and the
[39:16] purpose is not to get bogged down with
[39:18] life and to get absorbed with life and
[39:20] then try to achieve something in this
[39:22] life the whole point of living this life
[39:24] is to manifest and declare him
[39:28] and we'll declare it through trials and
[39:30] we'll declare it through families we'll
[39:32] declare it through situations amen we'll
[39:34] live amen we're still to engage in the
[39:36] world and live in this world Amen we're
[39:38] still to be part amen of what's going on
[39:41] here because this is where he wants his
[39:43] life on display
[39:45] so the job we don't all become monks
[39:50] so that we can serve the purpose of God
[39:52] we don't I mean we're not going to go
[39:55] into communal living so we could serve
[39:57] the purpose of God we are serving the
[39:59] purpose of God when we work our jobs and
[40:01] raise our families and take care of the
[40:02] things that he's given us responsibility
[40:04] over amen but we have to remember these
[40:07] things aren't my life he's my life
[40:12] and it takes a constant dialing back
[40:15] into the word and being sensitive to the
[40:17] spirit
[40:20] in proving his word the prophet says now
[40:22] we find that God come into this little
[40:25] cell see and he began to develop cells
[40:27] Drew from his mother's vitamins and
[40:29] things as she then when he become old
[40:32] enough to eat himself he began to eat
[40:34] and what what is that it's the dust of
[40:36] the Earth would you come up and plant
[40:37] life and animal life and so forth and as
[40:40] you begin to eat the fish and the bread
[40:41] and so forth it began to develop selves
[40:43] I love the way he talks about Jesus
[40:45] Christ and his body
[40:47] amen his body was formed like your body
[40:50] is formed from the material out of the
[40:52] Earth
[40:53] he ate like you eat and his body was
[40:56] formed
[40:58] praise God
[40:59] and then when it's fully matured at 30
[41:02] years old he was baptized in obedience
[41:04] to John or to God in the water and went
[41:07] out and what happened the dove which was
[41:10] gone
[41:11] descending from heaven with a voice
[41:12] saying this is my beloved Son in whom I
[41:15] am pleased to dwell what did he come to
[41:17] do to redeem that part of the earth he
[41:20] was the beginning of the creation of God
[41:22] because God is not a creation only in
[41:25] Christ he is a creation because God is
[41:28] eternal and the spirit and the spirit is
[41:30] not created he was the beginning of the
[41:33] creation of God and God redeemed that
[41:36] body see when he come down this is my
[41:38] beloved Son I'm well pleased in him he
[41:41] came down and he claimed that part of
[41:44] the earth he said this is mine this is
[41:46] who I am this is the part that I've
[41:48] created for myself to be my expression
[41:51] and flesh to be me in flesh
[41:53] and he claimed this part and through
[41:56] this part of the earth he was going to
[41:58] redeem the rest of the Earth all the
[42:00] other parts that are his
[42:02] that includes you and I
[42:05] so he God came down after going through
[42:08] this and now every son that you eat and
[42:11] born of a natural sex birth the way you
[42:14] come then when it comes to a place to
[42:16] where you go through water baptism then
[42:18] Holy Ghost baptism then the Holy Ghost
[42:21] comes down at the fire baptism and
[42:23] claims this creation
[42:27] the same as it did him the Holy Ghost
[42:30] and God is the same Spirit see it comes
[42:33] down and claims this body for the
[42:35] resurrection and he was raised for our
[42:37] justification all the father has given
[42:39] me will come not one will be lost I'll
[42:41] raise it up in the last day not one hair
[42:43] of your head will ever even perish that
[42:46] is the beginning of the creation of God
[42:48] this is the continuation of the creation
[42:51] of God
[42:54] what's the continuation when Christ is
[42:57] formed in you
[42:59] when when God Amen when the spirit of
[43:03] God which he says the spirit of God is
[43:04] God
[43:06] when the spirit of God which is the Holy
[43:09] Ghost which is the holy spirit which is
[43:11] the spirit of Christ
[43:13] when it unites with you amen you become
[43:16] a new creature a new creation in Christ
[43:19] Jesus old things have passed away amen
[43:22] everything else all things have become
[43:24] new you have become part of that race
[43:26] that he's the head of and he has come to
[43:29] you to birth you and a new birth
[43:31] separated from your original old birth
[43:33] your natural birth now there's a
[43:35] spiritual birth and you're part of this
[43:37] new race and you're a new creature in
[43:39] Christ Jesus
[43:41] and this is the continuation of the
[43:43] creation of God
[43:46] and the message who do you say this is
[43:48] but they think it's the most wonderful
[43:50] thing in the world that all of us can
[43:51] join hands and be one he's speaking of
[43:53] The ecumenical move
[43:55] Jesus prayed that we might be one that
[43:57] is true but not that kind of one
[43:59] he said be one as I am the father are
[44:02] one yea be that kind of one then how
[44:05] will that be the word in us would be the
[44:08] anointed word
[44:11] that is the Oneness of God the Oneness
[44:14] of God is the word anointed in you
[44:18] and then you become a son a messiah of
[44:21] the age
[44:22] if you have a predestinated see Gene of
[44:26] God Amen you've gone if you're a thought
[44:28] expressed you've got a portion of that
[44:31] thought in you a portion of that word
[44:33] amen and when when that Holy Ghost
[44:35] anoints you in the New Birth you become
[44:38] part of the anointed word amen
[44:41] and and the Oneness of God the word in
[44:44] us would be the anointed word that is
[44:47] Oneness of God the Oneness of God is the
[44:50] word anointed in you
[44:54] praise be to God
[45:01] we know Colossians 1 really well I'm
[45:04] just going to uh recite it here for you
[45:06] Colossians 1 26 even the mystery which
[45:09] has been hit from ages and from
[45:11] Generations but now has made manifest to
[45:13] his Saints to whom God would make known
[45:16] what is the riches of the glory of this
[45:18] mystery among the Gentiles which is
[45:20] Christ in you the hope of glory
[45:23] this is the great mystery among the
[45:25] Gentiles that will be Christ in you
[45:28] Christ the anointed word in you
[45:32] and we know brother Branham read this
[45:35] quote or read this scripture at the
[45:37] opening of Christ is the mystery of God
[45:39] revealed Christ is the mystery of God
[45:42] revealed so the revealing of the mystery
[45:45] of God is found in Christ
[45:47] and Christ is expressed in his body
[45:49] which is female which is bride amen so
[45:52] the mystery of God is continuing to be
[45:54] expressed through Christ and Christ is
[45:57] the head United to the body the marriage
[45:59] has come there's a union and they too
[46:01] are one and he is now expressing his
[46:03] life through as many membered bride and
[46:06] it's a continuation of the revelation of
[46:08] God
[46:10] in the message Christ is the mystery God
[46:12] revealed he says this is God's great
[46:13] mystery of Love expressed that God and
[46:16] man became one
[46:18] the whole thing is God in man one God
[46:21] and man was one there and God and man is
[46:24] one here
[46:25] what is it being filled with his Spirit
[46:27] him having the preeminances that was
[46:30] God's achievement that's God's purpose
[46:33] to do that that he might be in Christ
[46:35] and Christ in us and all of us together
[46:38] one
[46:41] this is God's achievement
[46:44] this is God's purpose
[46:47] and now we we have to continually like I
[46:51] said make God's purpose our purpose
[46:54] because God's purpose is the correct
[46:56] purpose if you want to know what your
[46:58] purpose is in this life this is your
[47:00] purpose amen that that Christ would live
[47:02] in you that Christ would Express through
[47:04] you that Christ would manifest through
[47:06] you that by the new birth you'd be part
[47:08] of that new creation that new race amen
[47:11] a super race a super church not where
[47:13] you have something to do but where he
[47:16] has something to do in you amen his life
[47:19] in you your life gone surrendered laid
[47:22] down and now his life taking preeminence
[47:25] and taking control that's God's
[47:27] achievement that's God's Great purpose
[47:29] amen that's the continuation of the
[47:31] creation of God that should be our main
[47:34] purpose
[47:37] not religious rhetoric
[47:40] not a pep rally not words that make
[47:43] people feel good I can stand up here and
[47:45] start screaming about your Egos and and
[47:47] this and that and get everybody so
[47:49] excited but if you're excited about
[47:51] being an eagle and excited about being a
[47:52] bride but you go out Monday and live the
[47:55] old life the old nature there's no
[47:57] there's no new race amen there's no new
[47:59] creation amen what was the purpose of
[48:01] the pep rally the purpose of coming to
[48:03] church is not just to get excited and
[48:05] feel good and go home having got a dose
[48:08] of medication it'll make you feel good
[48:09] for another few days but the purpose
[48:11] brother bear says we come here to see
[48:13] our bad parts we come here to see where
[48:15] we need to grow where we need to change
[48:17] we come here so that we can realign with
[48:19] the purpose of God and stop getting
[48:21] distracted by other things
[48:24] so that Monday morning we wake up and we
[48:26] know when your feet hit the floor what
[48:28] am I alive for what am I here for why am
[48:31] I in this time why has this word been
[48:33] revealed to me what am I doing on this
[48:35] Earth and what is God's Great purpose
[48:39] amen
[48:41] we can have a good time but I don't want
[48:43] a good time with no fruit
[48:45] I want fruit in my life I want this to
[48:47] be a living reality I want it to be
[48:49] genuinely amen the continuation of the
[48:53] creation of God
[49:00] in first John 4 17 he says herein is our
[49:03] love made perfect
[49:05] first John 4 17 here and as our love
[49:07] made perfect that we may have boldness
[49:09] in the day of judgment because as he is
[49:11] so are we in this world
[49:15] because as he is so are we this is what
[49:17] gives us great boldness in the day of
[49:19] judgment because as he is whatever he is
[49:22] so are we in this world
[49:25] in few in the future home he says see
[49:28] you were made for an eternal purpose
[49:30] because you was the manifestation of an
[49:33] attribute that was in God that thought
[49:35] of you and expressed you and he made an
[49:38] earth to take you out of and to make you
[49:40] a human being and sin come along and
[49:43] perverted his way you come anyhow
[49:47] you know the the the fall and the Garden
[49:51] of Eden never changed God's plan
[49:54] you came anyway he always determined for
[49:56] you to come in flesh he made an earth to
[49:58] take you out of Amen that attribute was
[50:01] a part of himself was to be expressed in
[50:03] flesh made out of this Earth Amen in the
[50:05] fall corrupted the flesh but it didn't
[50:07] stop God's plan you came anyhow
[50:13] right
[50:14] you come anyhow but you was lost with
[50:17] the world so he came and redeemed you
[50:20] the expressed attribute and also redeems
[50:22] this Earth by the same way then his
[50:25] purpose rolls on
[50:27] what is the point of redemption why did
[50:29] he come down to redeem the Earth and to
[50:32] redeem his that were in the earth why
[50:34] did he come down to shed righteous blood
[50:36] to pay the price of atonement to pray
[50:38] the price of redemption to redeem back
[50:40] all that was lost so that his purpose
[50:42] can roll on because his purpose hasn't
[50:44] changed his purpose was to have his
[50:47] attributes which is a portion of himself
[50:49] expressed in flesh your flesh
[50:55] in the Samaritan Church age
[50:58] from the church age book The Prophet
[51:00] says in very plain language the true
[51:03] bride of Christ was in the mind of God
[51:05] eternally
[51:07] though not expressed until each came
[51:09] forth and into designated decreed season
[51:11] as each member came forth it became
[51:14] expressed and took its place in the body
[51:16] thus the bride is the literal spoken
[51:19] word c brine
[51:22] and though she is feminine in
[51:24] designation she is also called the body
[51:26] of Christ
[51:27] it is very apparent that she ought to be
[51:29] called that for she was predestinated in
[51:31] him came from the same Source was
[51:34] eternal with him and is now manifesting
[51:37] God in a many-membered body whereas once
[51:40] God was manifest in one member even our
[51:42] Lord Jesus Christ
[51:45] so in in the Lord Jesus Christ God was
[51:48] manifest in one body now God is being
[51:51] manifest in a many-membered body
[51:56] now then here we are coming to a
[51:58] conclusion
[51:59] as the Eternal logos God was manifest in
[52:02] the son and in Jesus dwelled all the
[52:05] fullness of the God had bodily and that
[52:07] Eternal one was the father manifest in
[52:09] flesh and thereby gained the title of
[52:12] son even so we Eternal in his thoughts
[52:15] and our turn became the many member
[52:18] spoken word seed manifest in flesh
[52:23] I just want to draw your attention to
[52:25] something
[52:27] he said
[52:29] the Eternal logos
[52:31] God
[52:32] was manifest in the Sun
[52:34] and then Jesus throughout the fullness
[52:36] of the godhead bodily
[52:38] and that Eternal one was the father
[52:40] manifest In the Flesh and thereby gained
[52:43] the title of son
[52:46] he was still God
[52:49] but he was operating in the title of son
[52:53] then he came as the comforter he came as
[52:55] the holy spirit amen it was still God
[52:59] but with the title Holy Spirit
[53:02] amen he gave his word and his word is
[53:05] God
[53:06] with the title of word
[53:09] we understand these are the
[53:11] manifestations or the expressions or the
[53:13] Declarations of all that God had in his
[53:15] mind how God wanted to express himself
[53:18] Through Time amen and he expressed
[53:20] himself as the Holy Spirit it was God
[53:22] with the title Holy Spirit
[53:24] it was word and man that was God with
[53:26] the title of word amen he gained the
[53:29] title of son it was God Amen manifest in
[53:32] the form of a son and he had the title
[53:34] of son and what will it be when he
[53:37] manifest In You and I
[53:40] amen
[53:41] so thereby gaining the title son even so
[53:44] we
[53:46] Eternal in his thoughts in our turn
[53:48] became the many membered spoken word
[53:51] seed
[53:52] manifest in the flesh
[53:54] and those Eternal thoughts now manifest
[53:57] in flesh are the sons of God
[54:00] even as we are so called we did not
[54:03] become seed by the rebirth
[54:07] praise be to God almighty
[54:12] we did not become seed by rebirth we
[54:14] were seed when we were thoughts in his
[54:16] mind we were part of him we could never
[54:18] be separated from him what he is his
[54:22] thoughts are amen his attributes are
[54:25] actually parts of himself amen and we
[54:28] did not become seed by the rebirth we
[54:30] were seed and therefore were reborn for
[54:33] only the elect can be reborn because we
[54:37] were seed is the reason we could be
[54:39] quick and and non-seed there is nothing
[54:42] to Quicken
[54:43] and listen we're going to get down to
[54:45] the reality of this we did nothing we've
[54:49] done nothing we had nothing to do with
[54:52] any of this this was decreed and
[54:54] determined in himself before the
[54:57] foundation of the world he is living out
[54:59] his own drama for his own purpose to
[55:02] declare himself in the best way he saw
[55:04] fit and he he he has decided to portion
[55:08] himself out over time amen and to
[55:11] express himself out through the
[55:12] generations and You by the grace of God
[55:15] happen to be part of that expression
[55:17] amen of no merit of your own of no
[55:20] design of your own it was all in him
[55:24] amazing
[55:25] [Music]
[55:28] in non-seed there's nothing to Quicken
[55:31] hold this carefully in mind
[55:34] now take the next step redeem means to
[55:36] buy back it restores to the original
[55:37] owner God by his death the shed Blood
[55:41] Bought back his own he bought back the
[55:44] spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my
[55:46] voice word and they follow me you always
[55:49] worship you never were a pig or a dog
[55:52] turned into a sheep that is impossible
[55:55] for every kind of Life produces the same
[55:57] kind and there is no change in species
[55:59] as we were in the thoughts of God and
[56:01] then expressed in flesh there had to
[56:03] come a day when we could hear his voice
[56:06] the word and hearing that voice became
[56:08] aware of our father calling us and
[56:11] recognize that we are the sons of God we
[56:13] heard his voice and we cried out as did
[56:16] The Prodigal Son Save Me O my father I
[56:19] am returning to thee a Son of God can go
[56:22] a long time before he recognizes that
[56:24] he's a son
[56:25] but it doesn't mean he wasn't a son
[56:30] a sheep can think he's a pig he can
[56:33] think he's a goat he can think he's this
[56:34] for a long time an eagle can think he's
[56:37] a chicken for a long time amen but
[56:39] eventually he'll hear something that
[56:42] represents his true nature the reality
[56:44] of who he is and it'll call him out of
[56:47] confusion out of Amnesia out of the
[56:50] misunderstanding and bring them to the
[56:52] correct understanding
[56:56] praise be to God
[57:00] I was I was in the sanctuary last night
[57:02] praying and and I I tend to do this on
[57:05] Saturday nights I pray at the altar for
[57:07] a while and I walk the aisles and I pray
[57:09] and and I was in the back here praying
[57:13] and I said God
[57:15] we have tried so much to draw people
[57:19] we've tried through uh uh uh excitement
[57:23] we've tried through enthusiasm we've
[57:25] tried through debate we tried to
[57:27] intellectualism we've we've tried uh
[57:30] coercion and force and
[57:32] I'm talking not just I see I'm just
[57:34] talking about Christianity for the last
[57:36] 2000 years
[57:38] tried through persuasive altar calls and
[57:40] threats and and you know you could die
[57:43] tonight if you don't come down here and
[57:44] give your heart to the Lord and
[57:46] all of those things and I'm sure God
[57:48] used them all at different times for
[57:50] different ways to catch his children so
[57:52] I'm not condemning any of it I'm just
[57:54] saying God I was praying by they're gone
[57:56] I don't want to use Force I don't want
[57:59] to use a good reasoning I don't want to
[58:02] draw I'm not trying to attract people
[58:04] amen by my entertainment by an
[58:07] enthusiasm by an excitement and by by an
[58:10] exciting sermon or exciting music I
[58:12] don't want to attract people even by
[58:14] friendship and camaraderie God I want
[58:16] your word to be the attraction amen I
[58:19] want the reality of the truth of this
[58:20] day to attract the Sheep amen whether
[58:22] it's said quiet or said loud amen
[58:24] without Fanfare without Showmanship with
[58:27] without a bunch of program but just the
[58:30] word alone pulling God's elect back to
[58:32] where they came from
[58:34] the the pull of the reality of the word
[58:37] should be the greatest pull to a seed of
[58:40] God
[58:42] amen sometimes we get the idea that if
[58:44] we just befriend somebody and
[58:46] befriending them amen and they stay in
[58:48] the atmosphere long enough amen and they
[58:50] like all the people that they'll can get
[58:52] converted they might just come along and
[58:54] be a friend and never be converted
[58:58] and we should befriend everybody it's
[58:59] not about being nicer we should be nice
[59:01] and treat everybody hospitable but
[59:03] Hospitality won't bring a conversion
[59:08] all right uh uh enthusiasm won't bring a
[59:12] conversion
[59:13] excitement program a camaraderie amen
[59:18] entertainment none of that will bring a
[59:22] a change none of that will bring a new
[59:23] birth none of that will uh what will be
[59:26] the eagle scream that connects amen a
[59:29] predestinated seat of God back to a
[59:31] living God to Quicken that seed to life
[59:34] what is it going to take it's going to
[59:36] take the reality of the word that's been
[59:37] unveiled in this day
[59:40] and and and I just committed myself
[59:43] again said gone help me Amen to use no
[59:47] other tactic
[59:49] but the word
[59:51] pure unadulterated word the way it was
[59:54] delivered unto us amen if we could just
[59:56] give that out it'll draw the seed of God
[59:59] to itself that's what the word was sent
[1:00:01] for
[1:00:04] me so all kinds of efforts have gone
[1:00:07] into all kinds of things
[1:00:10] but it's just a lot of effort in the
[1:00:12] wrong direction
[1:00:15] but our effort should be not just to
[1:00:18] preach this word but to live it
[1:00:21] to preach it yes and to preach it true
[1:00:23] to share it to speak it to testify of it
[1:00:26] but that but what comes out of our mouth
[1:00:29] and what has lived out of our Lives
[1:00:30] needs to be a match
[1:00:33] it needs to be the Life of Christ it
[1:00:35] needs to be the new creation on display
[1:00:38] amen that gives validity to the words
[1:00:41] that are spoken because we're not just
[1:00:43] speaking words but we're demonstrating
[1:00:45] it with the power of God to change the
[1:00:46] life and line it to the word
[1:00:51] I said God let the reality let there
[1:00:54] come an Awakening to every seed when
[1:00:57] they hear that you were never a chicken
[1:00:59] you were never a dog you were never a
[1:01:01] goat but you were in the mind of God
[1:01:03] from before the foundation of the world
[1:01:05] I don't need to intellectualize that if
[1:01:07] there's a sieging of God laying there
[1:01:09] something in them is going to start
[1:01:10] stirring when they start to hear those
[1:01:12] words because it's a truth amen and the
[1:01:14] one who is truth is the one who put that
[1:01:16] seed down on the inside of them and that
[1:01:18] seed will respond to the truth
[1:01:22] praise God
[1:01:27] let's go to John 15.
[1:01:47] John 15 and 16.
[1:01:52] he says
[1:01:54] ye have not chosen me
[1:01:56] but I have chosen you
[1:02:00] you have not chosen me but I've chosen
[1:02:02] you and ordained you that you should go
[1:02:04] and bring forth fruit and that your
[1:02:06] fruit should remain that whatsoever ye
[1:02:09] shall ask of the father in my name he
[1:02:12] may give it you
[1:02:15] Jesus is done his disciples you haven't
[1:02:17] chosen me but I've chosen you
[1:02:20] what a tremendous revelation
[1:02:23] because I didn't choose myself in the
[1:02:25] beginning I can't untruse myself
[1:02:29] right I I didn't I'm not the one who
[1:02:32] made the choice I'm not the one who
[1:02:33] determined the election amen God is the
[1:02:36] one who determined that so I cannot
[1:02:38] undetermine my election by another
[1:02:40] Choice amen the choice is already set it
[1:02:43] was his choice it was determined before
[1:02:45] the foundation of the world my name was
[1:02:47] put in the Lamb's Book of Life and with
[1:02:49] indelible ink never to be removed my
[1:02:52] name was there when the lamb was slain
[1:02:54] before the foundation of the world I
[1:02:56] cannot be lost amen God has already made
[1:02:58] his choice it's not determined upon my
[1:03:01] choice amen my choice amen is not what
[1:03:04] God was dependent on it was his choice
[1:03:06] that he was dependent of
[1:03:11] my
[1:03:13] the grace of God
[1:03:15] the sovereignty of God it is an
[1:03:18] overwhelming reality
[1:03:22] God says to Jeremiah the prophet he
[1:03:25] tells him in Jeremiah 1 4 then the word
[1:03:27] of the Lord came unto me saying before I
[1:03:30] form thee in the belly I knew thee
[1:03:33] and before thou camest forth out of the
[1:03:35] womb I Sanctified thee and are ordained
[1:03:38] thee a prophet unto the Nations
[1:03:41] well what is Jeremiah going to do about
[1:03:45] that
[1:03:46] Jeremiah going to say uh well I I don't
[1:03:50] think so
[1:03:51] because you know I'm not as smart as I
[1:03:54] should be and I don't have as much
[1:03:55] education as I should have I don't know
[1:03:57] how much how old Jeremiah was but he was
[1:04:00] an adult at this time that the word of
[1:04:01] the Lord comes to him and God discloses
[1:04:04] this bit of information to him as an
[1:04:05] adult and he may have felt inferior he
[1:04:08] may have felt inadequate he may have
[1:04:10] felt that he made too many mistakes in
[1:04:11] the past he may have felt that he come
[1:04:13] from the wrong family I don't know what
[1:04:15] he felt as a man but it didn't matter
[1:04:17] what he felt as a man and to this point
[1:04:19] it didn't matter what he had done as a
[1:04:20] man God said before I formed thee in the
[1:04:24] belly amen God had a plan for Jeremiah
[1:04:27] before Jeremiah's life was even
[1:04:30] conceived
[1:04:32] before I form thee in the belly I knew
[1:04:35] thee and I tell you what else is amazing
[1:04:37] is God said I formed you in the belly
[1:04:42] so that willful act of mother and father
[1:04:45] of their own self-will was God
[1:04:50] and the same thing for you if you're a
[1:04:52] child of God God knew when you would
[1:04:54] come forth he looked after your lineage
[1:04:56] to get a certain temperament a certain
[1:04:58] way amen about you so that he could use
[1:05:00] you for his purpose and he watched after
[1:05:02] you generationally and he knew when you
[1:05:04] would come forth in what form you would
[1:05:06] come forth with with what
[1:05:08] characteristics you would come forth
[1:05:11] before I form thee in the belly I knew
[1:05:14] thee
[1:05:18] that
[1:05:20] listen he didn't say I knew of Thee
[1:05:23] I knew about thee
[1:05:26] he said I knew thee
[1:05:29] there was a fellowship somewhere
[1:05:32] somehow
[1:05:33] before the foundation
[1:05:37] before I formed thee in the belly I knew
[1:05:39] thee and before thou countest forth out
[1:05:41] of the womb I Sanctified thee and I
[1:05:44] ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations
[1:05:48] you know what Jeremiah didn't have to
[1:05:51] try to be a prophet
[1:05:53] he was a prophet
[1:05:55] he didn't have to wonder he didn't have
[1:05:57] to try you know a counting school that
[1:05:59] didn't work you know uh Seminary that
[1:06:02] didn't work Jeremiah I don't know what
[1:06:04] he did before but you know everybody's
[1:06:06] trying to find themselves we don't need
[1:06:08] to find ourselves we need to find Christ
[1:06:09] and whatever he's ordained us to be is
[1:06:12] what we will be amen Jeremiah was going
[1:06:15] to be nothing other than a prophet David
[1:06:17] was going to be nothing other than a
[1:06:18] king
[1:06:20] is that right because that's what God
[1:06:22] had predetermined that he was going to
[1:06:24] be and we spend so much time trying to
[1:06:26] self-determine and self-analyze and or
[1:06:29] or not even this I want to be and I want
[1:06:32] to be and I want to be it matters not
[1:06:35] what you want to be what matters is what
[1:06:37] God wants you to be and what God wants
[1:06:39] you to be is what you will be and the
[1:06:41] sooner you get with that program the
[1:06:43] easier life is going to be
[1:06:46] even brother Graham said God is going to
[1:06:48] even be expressed in your in your
[1:06:50] natural aptitude in your work and the
[1:06:52] things that you do
[1:06:54] and God knew and so there's no you know
[1:06:57] I sometimes high school kids when we had
[1:07:00] guidance counselors and they used to
[1:07:02] tell us you know you got to go to
[1:07:03] college and you got to do all this and
[1:07:05] then they would give you little charts
[1:07:07] and you would have all these potential
[1:07:09] jobs
[1:07:10] and the job market how many uh uh what
[1:07:13] kind of deficit there are and how many
[1:07:15] jobs the the this you know computer
[1:07:17] science or engineering they need this
[1:07:19] many roles so hey that'd be good they'll
[1:07:21] hire and then then they have a list of
[1:07:24] what they're likely to make
[1:07:26] make this and you make that you make
[1:07:27] this
[1:07:30] it comes down to it for a child of God
[1:07:32] it doesn't matter
[1:07:35] the chart throw it away
[1:07:38] because God's already determined what
[1:07:39] you're going to do
[1:07:41] God knows what you will be he knows how
[1:07:42] he will use you he knows what you're
[1:07:44] born for
[1:07:46] just yield to him walk with him put your
[1:07:50] hand in his and walk he knows
[1:07:53] where he's leading you
[1:07:56] look at John chapter 4.
[1:08:03] I'm sorry John chapter six not four
[1:08:14] John chapter 6.
[1:08:17] verse 44.
[1:08:22] no man can come to me except the Father
[1:08:24] which has sent me draw him and I will
[1:08:27] raise him up at the last days
[1:08:29] go to 65. chapter 6 verse 65.
[1:08:34] and he said therefore said I unto you
[1:08:36] that no man can come unto me except that
[1:08:38] we're given unto him
[1:08:39] of my father
[1:08:43] ma'am says in the message why are we not
[1:08:46] a denomination he says how are you going
[1:08:49] to if he made me what I am without
[1:08:50] having any choice at all I never went
[1:08:53] back there and saying now Charlie
[1:08:55] Charlie Branham you marry Ella Harvey
[1:08:57] and bring forth me out of the earth no
[1:08:59] sir I never had no choice of that
[1:09:02] God did that
[1:09:05] that listen to what he's saying that was
[1:09:08] not a random choice of two people
[1:09:11] and those two people were not serving
[1:09:13] God
[1:09:15] but God knew his Prophet was coming
[1:09:17] forth and he knew what union it would
[1:09:19] take and God watched over it
[1:09:24] God did that and if he made me what I am
[1:09:27] without a choice
[1:09:29] how much more when the Holy Ghost goes
[1:09:31] to brooding over me and I say yea Lord
[1:09:33] You're My Creator and I love you and
[1:09:35] accept you as my savior how are you
[1:09:37] going to hold me in the dust
[1:09:39] if God could bring brother Branham Out
[1:09:42] of the Dust out of the earth without his
[1:09:45] choice by bringing his mother and father
[1:09:46] together having a conception the food
[1:09:48] his mother eating and the food if God
[1:09:50] could bring him out of the Dust without
[1:09:52] his choice now that he's surrendered to
[1:09:54] the choice of God how will you ever hold
[1:09:55] his body in the dust
[1:09:58] God can do that and and God knew amen
[1:10:01] when he was going to come forth he knew
[1:10:03] where he was going to come forth he knew
[1:10:05] what temperament he would have he knew
[1:10:07] his father and mother was going to be
[1:10:08] God had already determined it he watched
[1:10:11] over he made it happen and that without
[1:10:14] the prophet's Choice God did that amen
[1:10:17] without him choosing that and now when
[1:10:20] he has Joyce his choice is to surrender
[1:10:22] to the Holy Ghost how much more will the
[1:10:24] program of God work if we're surrendered
[1:10:26] to his spirit
[1:10:27] he was working his program before you
[1:10:30] were surrendered to his spirit
[1:10:33] praise God let's go to Ephesians chapter
[1:10:36] one
[1:10:48] Ephesians chapter 1.
[1:10:50] and I'm going to begin reading at verse
[1:10:52] 3.
[1:10:54] Ephesians 1 and 3.
[1:10:56] blessed be the father the God and father
[1:10:58] of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed
[1:11:00] us with all spiritual blessings in
[1:11:02] Heavenly places in Christ
[1:11:04] according as he hath chosen Us in him
[1:11:07] before the foundation of the world that
[1:11:10] we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:11:12] before him in love
[1:11:14] having predestinated us into the
[1:11:16] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:11:18] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:11:21] of his will whose choice was it
[1:11:24] whose will was it whose pleasure was it
[1:11:27] for
[1:11:28] six to the praise of the glory of his
[1:11:31] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[1:11:33] in the Beloved in whom we have
[1:11:35] Redemption through his blood the
[1:11:37] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:11:39] riches of his grace wherein he hath
[1:11:41] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[1:11:43] Prudence having made known unto us the
[1:11:45] mystery of his will according to his
[1:11:47] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[1:11:49] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:11:52] fullness of times he might gather
[1:11:53] together in one all things in Christ
[1:11:55] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:11:58] on earth even in him
[1:12:00] and whom also we have obtained an
[1:12:02] inheritance being predestinated
[1:12:04] according to the purpose of him who
[1:12:06] worketh all things after the counsel of
[1:12:08] his own will
[1:12:11] he decided
[1:12:13] basically what he's saying is
[1:12:15] he decided he decided before he knew
[1:12:17] what he's going to do and he did it for
[1:12:19] his pleasure and he did it according to
[1:12:20] his own will
[1:12:21] and that's why you're here and that's
[1:12:23] why you believe
[1:12:25] verse 12 that we should be to the praise
[1:12:28] of his glory who first trusted in Christ
[1:12:30] and whom also in in whom he also trusted
[1:12:34] after that you heard the word of Truth
[1:12:36] The Gospel of your salvation in whom
[1:12:38] also after that you believed you were
[1:12:40] sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise
[1:12:44] God knew exactly what he was doing when
[1:12:47] you came forth
[1:12:49] God knew where his attributes where he
[1:12:51] knew where seed was he didn't lose any
[1:12:52] he didn't have to go and try to find
[1:12:54] them again and he didn't he you know he
[1:12:57] didn't uh guess when they would come
[1:12:59] forth he knew exactly when they were
[1:13:01] going to come forth
[1:13:03] and you are fashioned a certain way with
[1:13:06] certain characteristics you've come
[1:13:08] forth through certain parentage in a
[1:13:10] certain location
[1:13:11] being a certain race male or female
[1:13:14] certain gender all by his good pleasure
[1:13:17] by the pleasure of his will or by the
[1:13:20] Council of his own will
[1:13:22] and and that's why why can the Potter
[1:13:25] why can the clay say to the Potter why
[1:13:27] have you made me thus he can fashion
[1:13:29] whatever he wants any way he wants it's
[1:13:32] not for us to question why did you do
[1:13:33] this as if he made a mistake but to just
[1:13:36] recognize that what he does is good and
[1:13:37] it's for a purpose
[1:13:40] amen
[1:13:41] so God he knows exactly what he's doing
[1:13:44] with us and and it's no mystery for him
[1:13:47] but it's been most of our lives a
[1:13:50] mystery for us amen but the word of God
[1:13:52] is here to unravel the mystery so that
[1:13:55] we know who we are
[1:13:57] and the message Israel in the church he
[1:13:59] says now I want you to notice that is
[1:14:01] the beginning of Christianity of the
[1:14:03] church and I want you to notice it
[1:14:05] wasn't because Abraham was a good man
[1:14:07] it was because God elected and chose
[1:14:09] Abraham
[1:14:10] it wasn't Abraham choosing God it was
[1:14:13] God choosing Abraham can you see it and
[1:14:15] now watch now as it was then so is it
[1:14:18] today it isn't you choosing God it's God
[1:14:21] choosing you
[1:14:22] Abraham's the father of the faith but
[1:14:25] what did Abraham do to choose himself
[1:14:27] God came to him amen when when he was an
[1:14:30] ER of the chaldees and spoke to him and
[1:14:32] separated him out and let him out and
[1:14:34] showed up to him Abraham could never go
[1:14:37] find God's Dwelling Place God had to
[1:14:39] come to Abraham
[1:14:41] so it was God's choice God's will God's
[1:14:44] purpose all along
[1:14:47] let's look at Galatians chapter one
[1:15:03] Galatians 1 and 13.
[1:15:07] the Apostle Paul speaking for you have
[1:15:09] heard of my Converse conversation and
[1:15:12] time past in the Jews religion how that
[1:15:14] beyond measure I persecuted the Church
[1:15:16] of God and wasted it and profited in the
[1:15:19] Jew's religion above many mine equals in
[1:15:21] my own Nation but more exceedingly
[1:15:23] zealous of the traditions of my fathers
[1:15:25] but when it pleased God who separated me
[1:15:28] from my mother's womb and called me by
[1:15:30] his grace
[1:15:32] who separated who
[1:15:36] when it pleased God who separated me
[1:15:38] from my mother's womb and called me by
[1:15:40] his grace
[1:15:42] to reveal his son to me
[1:15:47] in me
[1:15:49] what what was Paul called for
[1:15:52] so that their son would be revealed in
[1:15:54] him
[1:15:56] but when it pleased God who separated me
[1:15:58] from my mother's womb and called me by
[1:16:00] his grace to reveal his son and me that
[1:16:02] I might preach him among the Heathen
[1:16:04] immediately I confer not with flesh and
[1:16:07] blood
[1:16:08] the Apostle Paul was chosen
[1:16:11] he didn't choose he was chosen
[1:16:14] he was fashioned for a purpose and if
[1:16:16] you look in Acts 9
[1:16:19] he speaks about this Acts chapter 9.
[1:16:23] verse 15.
[1:16:26] in Acts 9 and 15
[1:16:28] it says God is speaking now
[1:16:33] to ananias ananias is afraid to to go to
[1:16:36] Paul to go to Saul as God had
[1:16:39] commissioned him and so he tells the
[1:16:42] Lord this and the Lord responds but the
[1:16:44] Lord said unto him go thy way for he is
[1:16:47] a chosen vessel unto me
[1:16:50] to Bear my name before the Gentiles and
[1:16:53] the Kings and the children of Israel for
[1:16:55] I will show him how great things he must
[1:16:58] suffer from my name's sake
[1:17:01] God had chose Paul before Paul knew
[1:17:04] anything about it
[1:17:06] in fact it was God who separated Paul
[1:17:08] from his mother's womb
[1:17:09] and watched over him because God had a
[1:17:11] plan for him
[1:17:12] and when it was time to reveal his son
[1:17:15] in Paul he called to Paul and separated
[1:17:18] Paul out and Paul went into the
[1:17:20] Wilderness to learn of Christ himself
[1:17:22] amen and God says he's a chosen vessel
[1:17:25] unto me to Bear my name before Gentiles
[1:17:29] and kings and you think about the
[1:17:31] prophet of God in our day God had chosen
[1:17:34] Mount and selected him he was born A
[1:17:36] peculiar birth the the pillar of fire
[1:17:38] like a dove showed up and a light showed
[1:17:41] up when he was born who orchestrated
[1:17:43] that that was God who determined that it
[1:17:45] was gone amen he could hear voices as
[1:17:48] the voice of the Lord as a boy he could
[1:17:50] see Visions he didn't do anything to
[1:17:52] make himself that he was that
[1:17:56] he didn't do anything to bring it on why
[1:17:58] can a three-year-old boy do to bring on
[1:18:00] a vision
[1:18:01] did he pray enough did he fast enough
[1:18:03] did he spend enough time except no he
[1:18:06] was he was a prophet of God God called
[1:18:08] him and separated him from his mother's
[1:18:10] womb God watched over him and he had a
[1:18:12] vision when he was two or three years
[1:18:14] old of men falling off of a bridge and
[1:18:16] it wasn't when he was fasting and
[1:18:18] praying and separating himself out it
[1:18:20] just happened because that's what he is
[1:18:24] right and then God when he finally calls
[1:18:27] him and calls him to the field and he
[1:18:29] tells him that you have a gift of
[1:18:31] healing that you'll take to the peoples
[1:18:33] of the world Amen and you'll pray for
[1:18:35] kings and potentates and all these other
[1:18:37] things and here is a man with a seventh
[1:18:39] grade education moved from Kentucky to
[1:18:42] Southern Indiana as a boy I was only
[1:18:44] really known in this local community
[1:18:46] amen wasn't formally trained didn't have
[1:18:49] any formal backing how in the world was
[1:18:51] this man gonna pray for Kings amen but
[1:18:54] it wasn't up to him to worry about how
[1:18:56] he was going to pray for Kings God had
[1:18:58] already determined he was going to pray
[1:18:59] for kings and guess what he prayed for
[1:19:02] Kings multiple Kings in his lifetime an
[1:19:04] impossibility for that man to go to that
[1:19:07] place and pray for that person
[1:19:09] but God before determined that that was
[1:19:12] the way it's going to be so that was the
[1:19:14] way it was going to be
[1:19:16] amen it wasn't his effort that made him
[1:19:19] pray for a king amen God had already
[1:19:21] told him before he put forth any effort
[1:19:23] before he made a surrender Amen to go to
[1:19:26] the field I mean God had already said
[1:19:28] you're going to pray for Kings
[1:19:32] he said you're going to take a gift of
[1:19:33] healing to the peoples of the world and
[1:19:35] he told him that amen before that gift
[1:19:37] was really manifesting amen so what did
[1:19:40] Brother Branham have to do to manifest a
[1:19:42] gift in his life all he had to do was
[1:19:44] step out and be what God called him to
[1:19:47] be and it worked amen because of who he
[1:19:50] was
[1:19:51] [Music]
[1:19:53] not because of what he did but because
[1:19:55] of who he was
[1:19:57] and God you know God has determined
[1:20:00] something for each one of us and we are
[1:20:02] who we are amen you know there's there
[1:20:05] are some people in our midst who have
[1:20:08] extreme compassion and are always
[1:20:09] thinking of others and always remember
[1:20:11] somebody's birthday always remember your
[1:20:13] anniversary always send a card and they
[1:20:15] always ask you when you've been sick
[1:20:18] that's right there's others Among Us who
[1:20:21] could never remember your birthday and I
[1:20:22] forgot that you had a surgery I'm sorry
[1:20:25] but I love you
[1:20:29] is that true
[1:20:31] there are some who love Hospitality who
[1:20:33] love having people over and love putting
[1:20:35] together there are some who are more of
[1:20:37] a loner nature and love amen the either
[1:20:39] one-on-one conversations or time alone
[1:20:41] with God
[1:20:43] which one's right
[1:20:45] and which one's wrong
[1:20:48] there are some who can sing and some who
[1:20:50] can't sing
[1:20:53] and I'll name no names
[1:20:56] but what are you going to do to change
[1:20:58] that
[1:21:00] what are you going to do to change what
[1:21:02] God Made You
[1:21:04] some are a finger some are a toe
[1:21:06] some are an eyebrows some are what ever
[1:21:09] part of the body God already determined
[1:21:14] it's not for us to worry about what
[1:21:16] we're going to be
[1:21:17] our plan for a position or strive for a
[1:21:20] position or or hope or try or set
[1:21:23] ourselves up the only thing for us to do
[1:21:25] is just live
[1:21:27] because it's already in you to be it's
[1:21:29] already ordained for you to be whatever
[1:21:31] he's going to call you to be amen and
[1:21:33] you may feel a strong pull one way and
[1:21:35] that may be actually your gift but it's
[1:21:37] going to be God's timing when he puts it
[1:21:39] into place there's nothing you have to
[1:21:40] do about it just rest and let God bring
[1:21:43] it forth right
[1:21:45] we don't have to make ourselves anything
[1:21:46] he has already made us
[1:21:50] what we need to do is yield and just do
[1:21:53] what comes natural to do
[1:21:55] and you won't you won't even know it but
[1:21:57] you'll be serving the body and not even
[1:21:59] realizing that you're serving the body
[1:22:01] because it just comes natural
[1:22:04] God knew what Paul was going to be
[1:22:08] God ordained him and told him he'd pray
[1:22:11] for Kings
[1:22:12] God knew brother Branham was going to be
[1:22:15] and he knew in order to pull off an
[1:22:18] extraordinary worldwide Ministry
[1:22:20] he needed to be deficient of Education
[1:22:24] and Theological training in church
[1:22:27] backing
[1:22:29] the opposite of what everybody else
[1:22:32] carnally we think God knew
[1:22:35] he knew that he needed the prophet who
[1:22:38] was not confident in his education
[1:22:42] so that his confidence would be in
[1:22:43] Revelation
[1:22:46] he needed a prophet who wasn't schooled
[1:22:49] and wasn't educated in the Finer Things
[1:22:51] he needed him to be dependent on himself
[1:22:56] so that's the life that God gave you
[1:22:59] the life that God gave each one of us
[1:23:01] was so that God can draw out of us the
[1:23:03] attributes he wants and keep us from
[1:23:05] things that we don't need
[1:23:08] nothing bad has happened to us
[1:23:13] you say brother Chad
[1:23:15] I'm telling you
[1:23:17] nothing bad
[1:23:19] in the great economy of God has ever
[1:23:21] happened to us
[1:23:24] we think things were bad and negative
[1:23:26] and horrible
[1:23:28] brother man I'm growing up in poverty
[1:23:30] being made fun of those were bad things
[1:23:32] but it shaped him
[1:23:34] I read here I think a week ago the quote
[1:23:37] where mother banham was saying he says
[1:23:40] why when I was a young minister to God
[1:23:42] take my jerk my wife right out from
[1:23:44] under me why did he take my baby right
[1:23:46] out from under my heart
[1:23:48] he said I didn't understand he goes I
[1:23:50] didn't know then but I know now
[1:23:53] God was shaping him molding him
[1:23:56] when he stood at the bedside of his
[1:23:58] little baby suffering so much an
[1:24:00] eight-month-old baby suffering to her
[1:24:01] eyes crossed and he was shooting the
[1:24:03] flies out of her eyes and he prayed and
[1:24:05] like a black sheep come down and God
[1:24:07] wouldn't answer his prayer and he knew
[1:24:09] she was going to die and he had he had
[1:24:11] he had to watch her die and bury her and
[1:24:13] all the agony that he went through and
[1:24:15] it was real Agony friends when he tried
[1:24:17] to commit suicide he really wanted to
[1:24:19] commit suicide
[1:24:21] but God stopped him from committing
[1:24:23] suicide
[1:24:25] he wanted to shoot those boys who beat
[1:24:28] him up but God would not allow the gun
[1:24:30] to fire
[1:24:33] he wanted to shoot himself with his
[1:24:35] revolver but he just pull as hard as he
[1:24:38] might amen the hammer would never come
[1:24:40] down amen but he would throw it on his
[1:24:42] bed and it would shoot a shoot a hole in
[1:24:44] the wall
[1:24:47] his Agony was real his heartache is real
[1:24:49] his rage was real his sorrow and his
[1:24:52] depression was all real but through it
[1:24:54] all God was molding and shaping the
[1:24:57] character of a prophet so that he could
[1:24:58] use him for the purpose that he had in
[1:25:00] his life amen and brother Branham never
[1:25:02] looked back on those things with
[1:25:04] bitterness he never looked back with
[1:25:05] regret he never felt like he had missed
[1:25:08] out or lost or all of these things amen
[1:25:10] when he got to the end of life he knew
[1:25:12] it was all God training him shaping him
[1:25:14] and molding him because God needed him a
[1:25:16] certain way
[1:25:19] amen God knows
[1:25:22] God knows and it's his love that has
[1:25:24] brought all this to pass
[1:25:28] and you say why because you're serving
[1:25:30] him today
[1:25:32] because you love him with all your heart
[1:25:34] because you you want to give your life
[1:25:37] to him what made it that way I don't
[1:25:39] know all these circumstances work
[1:25:41] together to make our life what they are
[1:25:44] how it works only he knows
[1:25:47] but we don't have to make ourselves I I
[1:25:50] have so often seen somebody that I just
[1:25:53] genuinely admire I I admire it used to
[1:25:58] be I admired people who kept their mouth
[1:26:00] shut so much
[1:26:02] you would see a brother or a sister they
[1:26:05] were quiet and they would only speak
[1:26:06] when they needed to and what they said
[1:26:07] carried with wisdom and it was an answer
[1:26:09] to the question and I was blah blah blah
[1:26:11] blah blah blah blah blah blah then I
[1:26:13] even wrote note cards down and I kept
[1:26:15] him in my service truck where I worked
[1:26:16] and one of the cards that I kept on my
[1:26:18] visor so I could see it every time I got
[1:26:20] in my truck was the scripture that says
[1:26:22] even a fool when he holdeth his peace is
[1:26:25] counted wise
[1:26:31] and I tried so hard to change myself
[1:26:35] but God had a plan for my life
[1:26:38] not everything was right and some things
[1:26:40] needed to be brought in balance
[1:26:43] but God had a plan for my life
[1:26:46] God knew what he needed and he knew he
[1:26:48] needed the vessel a certain way to
[1:26:50] accomplish a certain purpose and when I
[1:26:53] was fighting hard to stop needed to be
[1:26:55] curbed
[1:26:56] but it was something that God was going
[1:26:58] to use
[1:27:00] it's still true even a fool when he
[1:27:02] keepeth his peace has counted as wise
[1:27:08] you know
[1:27:11] brother Brown says not all are prophets
[1:27:14] not all our Apostles not all of this or
[1:27:15] that but it is given those things are
[1:27:18] born in Us by election
[1:27:20] gifts and callings are without
[1:27:21] repentance how many scripture readers
[1:27:23] know that let's see gifts and callings
[1:27:24] not what you want to be it's what God
[1:27:27] makes you see you are because God has
[1:27:30] chosen you to be not because you chose
[1:27:33] to be God chose you
[1:27:36] and if you're trying to make yourself
[1:27:37] something that God hasn't chose you to
[1:27:39] do you're only a mimic and it'll never
[1:27:42] be a success you've got to be what God
[1:27:45] chose you to be
[1:27:49] Paul
[1:27:51] we're still on Paul the Apostle
[1:27:54] in First Corinthians 15 8 he says and
[1:27:57] last of all he was seen of me also as
[1:28:00] one born out of due time for I am the
[1:28:02] least of the Apostles that I am not Meek
[1:28:05] to be called an apostle because I
[1:28:06] persecuted the Church of God but by the
[1:28:09] grace of God I am what I am
[1:28:13] he didn't even consider himself worthy
[1:28:15] to be called an apostle but it was the
[1:28:17] grace of God that made him what he was
[1:28:19] and his grace which was bestowed upon me
[1:28:21] was not in vain but I labored more
[1:28:22] abundantly than they all yet not I but
[1:28:25] the grace of God which was with me
[1:28:28] he says that even that Grace was not
[1:28:31] wasted on me because more than all of
[1:28:33] them I labored more abundantly than he
[1:28:35] checks himself and says not I but the
[1:28:38] grace that they said not I but the grace
[1:28:41] of God which was with me it was an even
[1:28:43] Paul's Zeal it wasn't even Paul's
[1:28:46] ambition or burden that pushed him to go
[1:28:49] on the missionary Journeys to go from
[1:28:50] City to City when he got stoned and
[1:28:52] rejected and one to pick up and go to
[1:28:54] the next one that wasn't even his own
[1:28:56] Zeal that was the grace of God that was
[1:28:58] in him
[1:29:00] that was manifesting out
[1:29:03] Samson was called
[1:29:05] before he was born he was called To Be A
[1:29:08] deliverer
[1:29:10] he was a deliverer he was born to be a
[1:29:12] deliverer through all the mistakes of
[1:29:15] his life through the through the
[1:29:16] trappings of his own personality it
[1:29:18] never changed God's call in his life
[1:29:21] he was told he was told that the angel
[1:29:24] told his mother amen what he was that he
[1:29:27] was to be a Nazarite from the wound and
[1:29:29] that he was going to begin to deliver
[1:29:31] his people from the Philistines amen and
[1:29:33] God had already determined what Samson
[1:29:35] was going to be he wasn't waiting for
[1:29:37] Samson to get a little bit older and say
[1:29:39] yeah there's some pretty good muscle on
[1:29:40] that boy I think I
[1:29:43] I think I could use it he seems to have
[1:29:45] a strong some grit and a strong
[1:29:46] character he wasn't waiting to see what
[1:29:48] Samson was he knew what he was going to
[1:29:50] make Samson amen and he didn't need
[1:29:52] somebody with grit and he didn't meet
[1:29:54] somebody with muscles he needed a little
[1:29:55] old shrimpy mama's boy
[1:29:59] praise God
[1:30:01] and he determined what he was going to
[1:30:03] do and he did it and it was such a
[1:30:06] mystery to the Philistines they could
[1:30:08] not determine where he gets his strength
[1:30:10] because it wasn't what he had in the
[1:30:12] natural that made him strong it's what
[1:30:14] God had made him and determined him to
[1:30:16] be
[1:30:17] and so many times you know you you and I
[1:30:21] we all have different gifts and
[1:30:23] different things about us and others
[1:30:25] can't understand how is it they can
[1:30:26] always do this and how can they always
[1:30:27] pull that off and how come they can just
[1:30:29] I mean how is it that you can just sit
[1:30:31] down and all of a sudden a song comes
[1:30:32] and all you do is write it out to me
[1:30:34] that's the most foreign concept on the
[1:30:36] planet
[1:30:38] I tried to write poetry in high school
[1:30:42] as a required class and it was
[1:30:44] absolutely ridiculous it was just like
[1:30:46] whatever words I could put together to
[1:30:48] get the rhyme at the end and I didn't
[1:30:49] care what it said drive at the end we're
[1:30:51] done we wrote a poem
[1:30:54] hat cat satin whatever in between we got
[1:30:57] a poem
[1:30:58] but somebody who can sit and under the
[1:31:00] inspiration instantly it drop and write
[1:31:02] out a song and it's beautiful
[1:31:06] somebody even go from instrument and
[1:31:08] instrument and play them and in a few
[1:31:09] minutes they're playing another
[1:31:10] instrument and you ask them say how long
[1:31:12] have you been playing that oh this is
[1:31:13] the first time I've tried it
[1:31:18] some poor kid has been taking violin for
[1:31:20] five years
[1:31:21] and you say hey can I see your violin
[1:31:24] and you're over there you know 15
[1:31:26] minutes later you're playing something
[1:31:27] that poor kid's like give me back my
[1:31:29] violin
[1:31:32] I don't like you anymore
[1:31:36] but God determined that
[1:31:38] God put that in us and that's for a
[1:31:41] reason we don't ever want to try to be
[1:31:42] something we're not and don't ever fret
[1:31:44] about what you are just be what you are
[1:31:47] and serve God put your hand in his trust
[1:31:49] your your life into his and let him live
[1:31:52] his life through you and just be what
[1:31:54] he's called you to be
[1:31:58] amen
[1:32:00] Samson he had problems
[1:32:03] Samson had a problem with women Samson
[1:32:05] had a I would say a lack of character a
[1:32:09] lack of morality
[1:32:10] but he still was God's chosen vessel
[1:32:13] and brother Bram said in the message
[1:32:14] just once one more time lord said as his
[1:32:17] fibers begin to tighten and he's leaning
[1:32:20] into those columns as his fibers begin
[1:32:22] to tighten he said let me die with them
[1:32:25] I was born to destroy them let me die
[1:32:29] with them and his fibers his muscles
[1:32:32] tighten up his great huge muscles
[1:32:34] receive strength the Holy Spirit began
[1:32:36] to move upon him and he twisted That
[1:32:38] Rock with his mighty power and down she
[1:32:40] went all we need is sincere prayer once
[1:32:43] more Lord
[1:32:44] there was one thing that that that
[1:32:47] Samson could determine after being in
[1:32:49] slavery after grinding in the mill his
[1:32:52] eyes being plucked out and being in
[1:32:54] bondage to his enemy there was one thing
[1:32:56] he could come back to at the end of it
[1:32:58] all I was born to destroy them this is
[1:33:00] what I am here for I have failed I have
[1:33:03] failed miserably but he was willing to
[1:33:05] repent and he was willing to give all of
[1:33:07] himself now for his Commission
[1:33:10] he was finally after failure upon
[1:33:13] failure upon failure after making a
[1:33:15] mockery out of the things of God Amen
[1:33:17] after being taken captive and after
[1:33:20] giving in to a woman and being seduced
[1:33:22] by a woman and falling prey to a woman
[1:33:24] be having his head shaved his eyes poked
[1:33:27] out and putting bondage in the enemy's
[1:33:28] Camp the very ones that he was supposed
[1:33:30] to destroy are the ones that now he is a
[1:33:33] slave to what a shame what a mockery but
[1:33:36] it didn't change who Samson was and it
[1:33:38] didn't change God's Eternal purpose for
[1:33:40] Samson
[1:33:42] and when he came back to what his
[1:33:45] purpose was in Repentance and humility
[1:33:47] now as his muscles began to tighten
[1:33:49] against the pillars he says I was born
[1:33:52] to destroy them God once more God one
[1:33:56] more time let me die with the
[1:33:58] Philistines
[1:34:00] I say when we can surrender to the
[1:34:02] purpose that God has in us and if you
[1:34:04] don't know what is my purpose whatever
[1:34:06] you're doing is your purpose keep doing
[1:34:08] it when God wants to change it he'll
[1:34:10] bring a change don't look and seek for
[1:34:12] something just live all that you can do
[1:34:15] all that you can live of your life all
[1:34:17] that you can surrender surrender to him
[1:34:19] manifest the word give your life to him
[1:34:21] and let him live through you
[1:34:24] and die out to that purpose I'm not here
[1:34:27] for luxury
[1:34:29] I'm not here for reward I'm not here for
[1:34:32] accolades I'm not here for promotions
[1:34:34] I'm not here to be somebody to be
[1:34:37] recognized I am here to serve God's
[1:34:39] Eternal purpose that's in my life that's
[1:34:41] the only thing I want and everything
[1:34:43] else God gives to me or takes away from
[1:34:45] me I'm fine with because it's his
[1:34:46] purpose
[1:34:49] we fret so much about how to gain one
[1:34:51] more step
[1:34:53] and we cry so hard about the one we lost
[1:34:57] is that true
[1:34:59] we we we strain and frighten how to get
[1:35:03] this next step or how to accomplish this
[1:35:05] next goal and then when it bypasses us
[1:35:08] and somebody else got the promotion or
[1:35:10] something else happened and you lost out
[1:35:11] on the deal and then how did that happen
[1:35:13] I missed all of that and and all this
[1:35:15] all this wasted energy instead of just
[1:35:18] saying God if you want me to have it
[1:35:19] I'll have it if you don't I don't I'm
[1:35:20] trusting in you
[1:35:22] because I'm not living this life for me
[1:35:24] I'm living this life for you I am here
[1:35:27] to manifest to demonstrate to live the
[1:35:30] life of Jesus Christ through every
[1:35:32] circumstance
[1:35:34] success or failure Victory or defeat
[1:35:38] blessing or or hurt I'm here to express
[1:35:42] him
[1:35:45] Ephesians 2 and 8. I'll just read it's
[1:35:47] very familiar scripture to us Ephesians
[1:35:49] 2 and 8 for by grace are you saved
[1:35:51] through faith and not not of yourselves
[1:35:52] it is the gift of God
[1:35:54] not of Works lest any man should boast
[1:35:56] for we are his workmanship created in
[1:35:59] Christ Jesus unto good works which God
[1:36:01] hath before ordained that we should walk
[1:36:03] in them
[1:36:06] um
[1:36:07] am I missing something
[1:36:09] are we supposed to pick our own works
[1:36:13] no
[1:36:14] we are
[1:36:16] his workmanship
[1:36:18] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:36:21] which God hath before ordained that we
[1:36:25] should walk in them
[1:36:26] God knows what he wants you to do
[1:36:28] he knows what he wants me to do
[1:36:31] and the message things that are to be
[1:36:33] says now the only way that you can be a
[1:36:35] son or daughter of God
[1:36:36] is because you have to have eternal life
[1:36:39] and there's only one form of eternal
[1:36:41] life and that's God's life only one form
[1:36:43] of eternal life that was God there to be
[1:36:46] a Son of God you had to be in him always
[1:36:49] the gene of your life spiritual life
[1:36:52] tonight was in God the Father before
[1:36:53] there was even a molecule and you are
[1:36:56] nothing but the manifestation of the
[1:36:58] gene of life that was in God as a son of
[1:37:00] God
[1:37:01] now you're expressed after his word has
[1:37:05] come in you to light up this age
[1:37:09] you are expressing God's life in you
[1:37:12] because you are a son or a daughter of
[1:37:14] God therefore you get what I mean so you
[1:37:17] are you are now made you're sitting in
[1:37:20] this church tonight because your duty is
[1:37:22] to express God to this nation this
[1:37:24] people and this neighborhood where you
[1:37:26] associate
[1:37:28] wherever you are God knew that you would
[1:37:30] be there because you have to be one of
[1:37:32] his genes or his attributes you had to
[1:37:34] be if you ever if you've got eternal
[1:37:37] life then it always was eternal life and
[1:37:39] God before there was a foundation of the
[1:37:41] world knew that you would be here and
[1:37:43] when the word or the water of the
[1:37:45] washing of the water of the word fell
[1:37:47] upon you it expressed in a being now you
[1:37:50] have fellowship with your father God
[1:37:52] just as you have with your Earthly
[1:37:53] father
[1:37:55] God knew that you would be here
[1:37:57] and our duty is to express God to this
[1:38:02] nation this people this neighborhood
[1:38:04] where we associate what's your duty
[1:38:07] that's our duty how will we do it he's
[1:38:10] already determined whether you'll pray
[1:38:11] for Kings or not
[1:38:15] you know
[1:38:17] Isaiah had a prophecy that a virgin
[1:38:19] shall conceive
[1:38:21] before he spoke the prophecy God knew
[1:38:23] the virgin
[1:38:26] what could she do to earn that title
[1:38:29] what could she do that to say oh I hope
[1:38:32] he'll let me be that virgin that Isaiah
[1:38:34] spoke about I I just want to be the
[1:38:36] Virgin that no God already knew who she
[1:38:38] would be and when the time was appointed
[1:38:40] she didn't have to go anywhere seek
[1:38:42] anything do anything the angel came to
[1:38:44] her
[1:38:45] and said hell thou highly favored of the
[1:38:48] Lord where the Lord is with thee and she
[1:38:51] she is just as shocked as anybody else
[1:38:53] that she is going to be the the virgin
[1:38:56] that's the Fulfillment of Isaiah 7 but
[1:38:59] God knew beforehand and God knew where
[1:39:01] she was what city she dwelled in what
[1:39:03] time she was coming to the well and he
[1:39:05] could send Gabriel at exactly the right
[1:39:07] time he knew the time the season he knew
[1:39:10] who she was where she was where she was
[1:39:12] born where she lived
[1:39:14] what did she have to do nothing but
[1:39:17] surrender to what she heard
[1:39:20] Zechariah and Elizabeth had lived all
[1:39:22] their life Barren had no children it was
[1:39:25] a hardship it was it was not an easy
[1:39:27] situation it was a reproach amen for a
[1:39:30] woman in that day amen but God had
[1:39:32] already determined he had a special
[1:39:34] thing for them to do she was Barren
[1:39:37] Zacharias and Elizabeth could have no
[1:39:39] child they were getting older in age he
[1:39:41] was serving in the temple how many times
[1:39:43] did he pray did they pray for a baby
[1:39:47] ask yourself it was you how many times
[1:39:49] would you pray
[1:39:51] how many times would you ask God why why
[1:39:53] couldn't I just have a baby why why why
[1:39:56] amen we could pray so many times we
[1:39:58] could ask so many times but God knew
[1:40:00] that they were going to bring forth John
[1:40:01] the Baptist and he knew when they were
[1:40:03] going to bring him forward then they
[1:40:04] knew how he was going to bring him forth
[1:40:05] and he was holding back preserving them
[1:40:07] for that special work
[1:40:09] [Music]
[1:40:11] disappointment I'm sure they had it
[1:40:13] misunderstanding they probably didn't
[1:40:15] understand the plan of God but God
[1:40:17] understood his plan and he knew who they
[1:40:19] were and where they were and in the
[1:40:20] right season he knew how to get the word
[1:40:22] to them
[1:40:24] all right
[1:40:27] God knows where you're at
[1:40:29] he knows what you're doing
[1:40:31] he knows what his plans are for you
[1:40:35] don't stress don't fret Just Surrender
[1:40:38] to him
[1:40:39] don't be ambitious
[1:40:41] one thing that we could lose in life we
[1:40:44] could lose a whole lot of ambition let's
[1:40:46] not be ambitious
[1:40:48] I only want what he wants me to have
[1:40:52] Abraham was rich but not because of
[1:40:54] ambition
[1:40:55] Abraham was rich because God made him
[1:40:57] rich
[1:41:00] I don't want to be ambitious I just want
[1:41:01] to be what God wants me to be
[1:41:03] I want to be free to be whatever he
[1:41:06] desires for me to be and I want to be I
[1:41:09] want to keep myself free from the world
[1:41:11] so that he can send me anywhere and do
[1:41:13] anything he wants with me so it'll be
[1:41:16] him and not me and then whatever happens
[1:41:18] amen there's no way that I can get the
[1:41:21] credit for it because I had no ambition
[1:41:22] it was him not me
[1:41:25] let me think brother Branham could get
[1:41:27] credit for going and praying for King
[1:41:29] George
[1:41:30] how did he make it happen God made it
[1:41:33] happen God gets the credit for that
[1:41:37] in the laodicean church age from the
[1:41:39] church age book Prophet says herein is
[1:41:41] now set forth the love of God
[1:41:44] he desired in love a family of his own
[1:41:52] if you're part of that family
[1:41:54] you're an expression of the love of God
[1:41:58] hearing is now set forth the love of God
[1:42:00] he desired in love
[1:42:03] a family of his own
[1:42:05] a family of Sons Sons like himself
[1:42:09] there before him lies all mankind as one
[1:42:12] lump of clay out of that same lump he
[1:42:14] will now make vessels into honor and
[1:42:15] unto dishonor the choosing will be his
[1:42:18] own Jews in then those chosen ones born
[1:42:21] of his spirit will be trained to conform
[1:42:24] to His Image in their walk
[1:42:27] he proves with he reproves with all
[1:42:29] long-suffering and gentleness and mercy
[1:42:31] he chastens with nail scarred hands
[1:42:33] sometimes this Potter must take the
[1:42:35] vessel he is working on and thoroughly
[1:42:37] break it down in order that he may
[1:42:39] rebuild it exactly as he desires it but
[1:42:42] it is love
[1:42:44] that is his love another way of his love
[1:42:47] there is not there cannot be
[1:42:51] his love
[1:42:53] the love of God was in love to have a
[1:42:56] family of his own to have sons like
[1:42:58] himself
[1:42:59] and in his love he will bring forth
[1:43:01] those sons in their decreed season and
[1:43:03] he will manifest in them what he has
[1:43:06] already determined to manifest of his
[1:43:07] attributes
[1:43:09] and in doing so he will train
[1:43:14] those he said then those chosen ones
[1:43:17] born of a spirit will be trained to
[1:43:19] conform to his image with their walk
[1:43:22] what's happening in our walk we're being
[1:43:25] trained
[1:43:26] what are we being trained for for his
[1:43:28] eternal purpose
[1:43:30] we're being trained through the things
[1:43:32] that we experience in life and through
[1:43:34] the corrections and through the
[1:43:35] blessings we're being trained
[1:43:38] to to walk in his very image to express
[1:43:40] his very life to fulfill his very
[1:43:44] purpose in our lives our life is a
[1:43:47] constant training and shaping and
[1:43:48] molding and moving and bringing us into
[1:43:51] the purpose for our lives
[1:43:54] it's his love
[1:43:56] it is the expression of his love it is
[1:43:58] the desire of his heart it is a family
[1:44:00] in love that is expressing his love and
[1:44:04] his desire and it's his love that will
[1:44:06] reprove and Chase and not because he
[1:44:08] punishes him because he doesn't lie
[1:44:10] because he has the picture set in love
[1:44:12] and he's bringing everything according
[1:44:13] to his picture of love
[1:44:16] and when we catch the same image the
[1:44:19] same thing the same vision there's
[1:44:20] nothing else we want
[1:44:23] is there anything else you want than the
[1:44:25] walking is purpose
[1:44:26] is there anything else you want them to
[1:44:28] be pleasing to him is there anything
[1:44:29] else you want than the walk and the
[1:44:32] Eternal purpose that he had before the
[1:44:34] foundation of the world to walk step and
[1:44:36] step with that purpose that he designed
[1:44:38] in great love amen there's nothing else
[1:44:40] we want we want that too it's his love
[1:44:43] and our love working together to bring
[1:44:45] us into conformity
[1:44:46] into his image of his word
[1:44:49] let's look at Romans chapter 8 together
[1:44:59] Romans chapter 8.
[1:45:03] in verse 29.
[1:45:10] for whom he did for no he also did
[1:45:12] predestinate
[1:45:13] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:45:16] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:45:18] many brethren moreover whom he did
[1:45:20] predestinate them he also called whom he
[1:45:23] called then he also Justified and whom
[1:45:26] he justified then he also glorified
[1:45:30] we have been
[1:45:32] predestinated
[1:45:34] to be conformed to the image of a son
[1:45:38] we have been predestinated to be
[1:45:40] conformed to display the very life and
[1:45:44] nature of Jesus Christ
[1:45:48] everything
[1:45:51] we experience
[1:45:53] in the message keeps going deeper
[1:45:57] just for me so much deeper
[1:46:00] it's not not just the fact that God sent
[1:46:03] a prophet but now it's deeper because
[1:46:04] God sent a prophet to me
[1:46:07] so on the surface God sent a prophet to
[1:46:10] restore the Jews praise God but the
[1:46:11] scripture says behold I send you a
[1:46:13] prophet so now it's deeper now God Did
[1:46:16] It For Me
[1:46:19] and and then you know God uh broke the
[1:46:23] the bonds of denominationalism to free
[1:46:26] his people to be all he called him to be
[1:46:27] amen and so now we've been freed from
[1:46:30] denominationalism from ideas of man and
[1:46:33] that's great but it goes deeper than
[1:46:34] that because now I need to be freed from
[1:46:38] the very core of denominationalism and
[1:46:40] that's man's thinking
[1:46:42] and now that's in me
[1:46:44] so now I need the word to break my
[1:46:47] thinking
[1:46:49] and so it just keeps this message just
[1:46:51] keeps going deeper and deeper and now
[1:46:54] you know first you start to learn about
[1:46:56] God Amen and you start to to see a man
[1:47:00] who experienced God and you learn about
[1:47:02] God and how God deals with the son but
[1:47:05] then all of a sudden you step into the
[1:47:07] picture and you become you become the
[1:47:09] son that he's dealing with and you start
[1:47:11] to experience God dealing with you
[1:47:13] not just watching it in the life of the
[1:47:15] Prophet but now it's happening in our
[1:47:17] lives now God is dealing with us as Sons
[1:47:21] and it goes deeper and deeper and now
[1:47:23] it's not that I just want to to live
[1:47:26] right amen I want to think right I want
[1:47:29] to be right that it's not that I just
[1:47:32] want to conform on the outside to a to a
[1:47:35] standard that I know is pleasing to God
[1:47:37] but I want in in the depth of my soul
[1:47:40] for the life the essence of who I am to
[1:47:43] be in the very image of God to be a
[1:47:47] place that God is dwelling on this Earth
[1:47:49] in me
[1:47:52] I I don't just want to know about him I
[1:47:55] want to know him I don't want I don't I
[1:47:58] don't want to just learn facts I want to
[1:48:00] know the reality I want to experience
[1:48:02] the relationship I want to think like he
[1:48:05] thinks and I want it to translate into
[1:48:07] walking like he walks and talking like
[1:48:09] he talks
[1:48:11] I just don't want to see what he's done
[1:48:13] I want it to be what he's doing but I
[1:48:15] want him to do it in me and I want to be
[1:48:17] changed thoroughly completely I want to
[1:48:19] be that new creature in that new race
[1:48:22] living a new creature kind of life
[1:48:25] it's got to go deeper it's got to go to
[1:48:28] the core it's got to root out all of
[1:48:30] self and it's got to leave only room for
[1:48:32] him to manifest himself
[1:48:35] what he's determined that's what I want
[1:48:37] him to have
[1:48:39] what he's withheld I don't want
[1:48:41] it's got to be his eternal purpose and
[1:48:44] our love for him and his love for us and
[1:48:46] this great love love relationship
[1:48:48] creating love slaves
[1:48:51] to Christ Jesus
[1:48:54] but we have been predestinated to be
[1:48:56] conformed into his image
[1:48:59] brother man said born Christians grow
[1:49:02] into the stature of Christ as they live
[1:49:06] Paul the Apostle says in Galatians 4 19
[1:49:09] my little children of whom I travail in
[1:49:11] birth again until Christ be formed
[1:49:14] in you
[1:49:16] he was laboring to bring forth Christ
[1:49:19] in them
[1:49:21] and now this message is here to bring
[1:49:23] forth Christ in a mini-membered body to
[1:49:26] bring forth Christ in you
[1:49:28] the message goes deeper than than you
[1:49:32] know bride and we have a a mini-membered
[1:49:35] body but now it comes down to I am a
[1:49:38] member of that body
[1:49:41] it's me in Christ it's Christ in me
[1:49:46] it brings a personal responsibility it
[1:49:49] brings a private life
[1:49:52] I think that's what this word in this
[1:49:54] day was meant to do
[1:49:55] not to bring another religion another
[1:49:57] form another ritual but it was come to
[1:49:59] unite Sons and Daughters of God with the
[1:50:02] head with Christ Jesus so that there is
[1:50:04] a personal intimate individual
[1:50:06] relationship between us and our maker so
[1:50:09] that we cry out to him and he hears us
[1:50:11] and we commune back and forth with him
[1:50:13] in his love plan
[1:50:16] it's got to go deeper
[1:50:20] because this is the continuation of the
[1:50:23] creation of God
[1:50:24] not a form of religion a living reality
[1:50:28] not a gathering place for people who
[1:50:31] share the same or similar Doctrine but
[1:50:33] an individual totally sold out to God
[1:50:36] who's now expressing the very Life of
[1:50:38] Christ in their flesh
[1:50:40] that's what this message came to do
[1:50:44] and the unveiling of God he says and it
[1:50:46] shall come to pass in the last days
[1:50:47] saith God here we are see here we are
[1:50:51] the light over the world as the light of
[1:50:53] the sun changes the seed from glory to
[1:50:55] glory we also become more like him as we
[1:50:58] live in his presence like him being
[1:51:00] conformed to his blessed image as we
[1:51:03] walk with him
[1:51:05] why is it we keep reading the message
[1:51:07] why is it we keep listening why is it we
[1:51:09] keep coming to service for this
[1:51:11] scripture right here for this quote
[1:51:13] because we become more like him as we
[1:51:15] live in his presence
[1:51:18] as the sun changes the seed from glory
[1:51:20] to glory and the presence of the Sun the
[1:51:22] the seed is constantly unfolding the
[1:51:25] nature that's in itself
[1:51:27] and the presence of that Sun as it draws
[1:51:29] the seed out of the ground it comes
[1:51:31] forth as a little blade and it comes
[1:51:33] forth as a stalk and then a tosso and a
[1:51:35] shock and and then finally it comes back
[1:51:37] to the very life that was in it from the
[1:51:39] beginning then it's in the presence of
[1:51:41] the sun day by day that it draws more
[1:51:44] life and more life and more life and
[1:51:46] more life until finally it returns to
[1:51:48] what it was always meant to be to the
[1:51:51] very purpose of its planting in the
[1:51:52] beginning
[1:51:54] and that is a Christian's life we are
[1:51:56] here to lay in the presence of the sun
[1:51:58] we are here to stay under this word and
[1:52:01] let this word draw more life out of the
[1:52:03] predestinated seed that's already in us
[1:52:05] the very attributed and part of God that
[1:52:08] he's placed within the children of God
[1:52:10] the word that we're laying under day by
[1:52:13] day and hearing amen May the light get
[1:52:15] brighter and brighter as it draws more
[1:52:18] life more of the original life out of us
[1:52:21] and it becomes more evident in our lives
[1:52:28] in the Rapture message
[1:52:31] he says the shock is pulled away
[1:52:34] and the wheat must lay in the presence
[1:52:36] of the sun to be ripened
[1:52:39] that's what this message is supposed to
[1:52:41] be doing to us
[1:52:43] we shouldn't be going backwards in
[1:52:44] maturity
[1:52:46] we shouldn't be going backwards in our
[1:52:48] walk we shouldn't we shouldn't be
[1:52:49] turning from Back to the weak and
[1:52:51] beggarly elements of the earth we
[1:52:53] shouldn't be getting caught up again and
[1:52:55] the things of the world we're a new
[1:52:56] creature everything else is dead to us
[1:52:58] amen but we should be growing and
[1:53:00] christ-like character we should be
[1:53:02] coming more like him all the time this
[1:53:05] message amen has the power amen it is
[1:53:08] the light that will bring the
[1:53:09] transforming power out of the sea
[1:53:13] he says in Christ is the mystery of God
[1:53:15] revealed he said that is his purpose
[1:53:17] that's why he died that's the second
[1:53:19] fold of his threefold manifestation
[1:53:20] first to express himself in Christ
[1:53:23] then Express his self through the church
[1:53:27] and the same thing Christ was the word
[1:53:28] in the church becomes the word when it
[1:53:31] lets the word go through them
[1:53:37] Ephesians 5 25 says husbands love your
[1:53:41] wives even as Christ also loved the
[1:53:43] church and gave himself for it that you
[1:53:46] might that he might sanctify and cleanse
[1:53:47] it with the washing of Water by the word
[1:53:50] that he might present to himself a
[1:53:52] glorious church not having spot or
[1:53:54] wrinkle or any such thing but it should
[1:53:57] be holy and without blemish
[1:54:00] what is the word doing it's making us
[1:54:03] perfect
[1:54:05] spotless the word is washing I say this
[1:54:09] way the word is washing away everything
[1:54:11] that's not compatible with the word
[1:54:15] everything that's dirty everything
[1:54:17] that's not clean everything that's not
[1:54:19] pure is being washed away by the washing
[1:54:22] of the water of the word and we must
[1:54:24] constantly stay under the flow where the
[1:54:25] water of the word is washing over us and
[1:54:29] washing out impurities and moving away
[1:54:31] everything that's not pure that's not
[1:54:33] word so that the washing of the water of
[1:54:36] the word will never remove the word
[1:54:38] it'll only remove non-word
[1:54:40] so what's not word in our lives let the
[1:54:43] word wash it away so that what his word
[1:54:45] will remain
[1:54:49] that's why we come to church Wednesday
[1:54:51] and Sunday
[1:54:52] not to hear how good we are but to see
[1:54:54] our bad parts
[1:54:55] to stay in the light for growth to be
[1:54:58] encouraged in our walk to provoke one
[1:55:00] another and to love and good works
[1:55:03] in The Invisible Union of the bride of
[1:55:05] Christ the prophet said the spirit the
[1:55:07] spiritual union of Christ in his church
[1:55:09] now
[1:55:10] when the flesh is becoming word
[1:55:15] and the word is becoming flesh
[1:55:18] manifested
[1:55:20] Vindicated
[1:55:22] what is the word doing it's becoming
[1:55:25] flesh
[1:55:26] where is the word which is God
[1:55:30] where is the word becoming flesh
[1:55:33] in our flesh
[1:55:36] the word is taking on flesh
[1:55:39] and the flesh
[1:55:40] is becoming the word
[1:55:43] to where the life that we live
[1:55:45] is supposed to be the life of the word
[1:55:49] let the washing of the water of the word
[1:55:51] wash away everything that's not God's
[1:55:54] purpose
[1:55:55] that's not God's plan that's not God's
[1:55:58] word and under this under this spout
[1:56:01] where the water is Flowing let it wash
[1:56:03] away every impurity every old nature
[1:56:06] every old desire every carnal thing of
[1:56:09] the word and so where our heart and
[1:56:11] affection is purified by the washing of
[1:56:13] the water of the word and we want what
[1:56:15] God wants in every situation of Our
[1:56:17] Lives that's the way we've lived for
[1:56:19] years but it's it's taken the washing of
[1:56:21] the water of the word to bring a further
[1:56:23] realization that this has to go
[1:56:25] and this has to go and this has to go
[1:56:28] and that's not what he wants from me
[1:56:30] it's the washing of the water the word
[1:56:31] continually a Christian grows in
[1:56:34] christ-like character as he walks in the
[1:56:35] presence of Christ
[1:56:37] let's keep walking in the presence of
[1:56:38] Christ and trusting that the son
[1:56:41] will do the work the washing of the
[1:56:42] water the word will do the work because
[1:56:44] this is the continuation of the creation
[1:56:47] of God
[1:56:48] it's got to be God on display
[1:56:51] the second fold of his threefold plan
[1:56:54] first to get preeminence in a man he did
[1:56:58] that in Christ Jesus second to get
[1:57:00] preeminence in a people he's doing that
[1:57:02] now in the body of Christ Jesus
[1:57:06] is he giving preeminence I say Lord have
[1:57:09] preeminence
[1:57:10] I want you to have preeminence and keep
[1:57:12] washing me I can't do it myself
[1:57:16] you and I can do no more to fulfill the
[1:57:19] purpose God has for us then brother
[1:57:21] Branham could to go pray for a king
[1:57:25] but God has predestinated us to be
[1:57:27] conformed to the image of his son it's a
[1:57:30] promise we just need to stay under the
[1:57:33] water we just need to stay in the light
[1:57:35] and this walk in this presence and he
[1:57:38] will accomplish everything he's promised
[1:57:40] to accomplish in our lives
[1:57:42] amen let's all Stand Together
[1:57:51] your life is not an accident
[1:57:54] if you're a child of God your life is
[1:57:56] not an accident
[1:57:58] you're not here by accident
[1:58:00] and if you're not here if you're not
[1:58:02] here by accident then you're not here
[1:58:03] without purpose the musicians want to
[1:58:05] make their way up
[1:58:08] don't let the devil tell you nothing's
[1:58:10] happening in your life something's
[1:58:12] happening
[1:58:13] you're not here without a purpose and
[1:58:15] you didn't come without a plan and God
[1:58:17] knew when you would arrive and where you
[1:58:18] would arrive and who your parents would
[1:58:21] be and he knew the struggles that would
[1:58:22] be in your life and he knew what you
[1:58:24] would have to overcome and he already
[1:58:25] made a provision for all of it
[1:58:28] now all we have to do is just trust
[1:58:31] that he knows what he's doing
[1:58:34] how could the prophet of God go stand
[1:58:36] night after night after night before
[1:58:38] thousands of people
[1:58:40] call a prayer line knowing that he can
[1:58:43] do nothing to discern he can do nothing
[1:58:45] to make a vision come he can do nothing
[1:58:47] to heal these people
[1:58:49] how could he do it because God told him
[1:58:52] that was his purpose
[1:58:54] how is it that we can walk in a world
[1:58:56] that's so filthy knowing that we won't
[1:58:58] be defiled not being afraid of falling
[1:59:01] away because we know his purpose for us
[1:59:04] is to bring us through his purpose to
[1:59:06] manifest himself that we're not going to
[1:59:08] fall away we're not going to be deceived
[1:59:10] we're not going to be trained right but
[1:59:12] God has a purpose in our life and he's
[1:59:14] called us for a purpose and we're not
[1:59:16] afraid to go out and live that purpose
[1:59:18] because God is backing it up
[1:59:21] God is good friends his plan is good and
[1:59:24] he's given us everything we need
[1:59:26] to continue to reveal God to this world
[1:59:30] let's bow our heads and pray
[1:59:33] Lord Jesus we thank you
[1:59:36] father I'm so grateful Lord for your
[1:59:38] word

[1:59:51] very mind and showed us that we were
[1:59:53] there
[1:59:54] and there you had a plan and that plan
[1:59:56] was perfect
[1:59:58] and God we rejoiced in that plan one day
[2:00:00] when the sons of God shouted for joy
[2:00:03] God now you're working that plan in our
[2:00:06] lives

[2:00:30] to be what you call us to be in this
[2:00:32] life vessels Lord that you shall use as

[2:01:21] turn away from carnal things help us to
