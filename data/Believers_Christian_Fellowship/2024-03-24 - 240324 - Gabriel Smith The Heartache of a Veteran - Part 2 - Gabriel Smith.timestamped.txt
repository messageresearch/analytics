[7:50] [Music]
[7:53] humble
[7:58] pray amen
[8:00] and it's
[8:03] uh it's my prayer this
[8:07] morning
[8:09] preeminence
[8:10] um may seem like a big word but it's
[8:14] really pretty
[8:17] simple and it just means first
[8:20] place and the Lord can just have first
[8:23] place in our
[8:24] lives and I I think if
[8:28] um that word
[8:30] word became
[8:33] um more of the centerpiece of our
[8:36] heart I believe uh we'd see more
[8:40] Supernatural in our
[8:43] lives we'd see less
[8:46] heartaches see less
[8:48] pain
[8:50] suffering and but I think that's why we
[8:52] come to the house of God this morning so
[8:54] that we can dial to ourselves a little
[8:58] bit more and
[9:00] today is the
[9:02] day today is the day and I I want to die
[9:05] early and maybe I can die a little bit
[9:07] more this
[9:09] afternoon and so
[9:12] um I um just appreciate the Lord and
[9:17] thankful to be a
[9:19] Christian appreciate uh every one of you
[9:22] coming out to the house of the Lord and
[9:25] trust that uh something can be said this
[9:28] morning to
[9:29] help you on your Christian
[9:31] Journey that's certainly um the only
[9:36] reason why I'm here this morning is for
[9:39] that
[9:41] purpose and um in order for that to
[9:45] happen I got to be able
[9:48] to surrender
[9:50] myself I
[9:52] um I know uh brother Chad ain't here but
[9:56] uh I was uh
[9:59] I was hearing his voice in my head this
[10:02] morning he was just saying relax just
[10:06] relax he always tells the preachers that
[10:09] relax he's about 14 hours away but I can
[10:13] hear him that just relax we just uh just
[10:18] going to relax this morning uh I do send
[10:21] greetings from Brother Chad yeah I was
[10:23] thinking about um our pastor you know
[10:29] man's 14 hours away and constantly
[10:32] reaching out and I'm praying for you
[10:35] praying for the service and I thought
[10:37] man that's that's that's a real
[10:39] Pastor you know I don't I don't know
[10:41] where he's at in his uh services and you
[10:45] know what time of the hour it is I know
[10:48] it's a 14-hour difference but I'm sure
[10:51] uh for him to try that be Focus for the
[10:54] the churches there but it just shows
[10:57] that his heart is in life
[11:00] and so I just I love appreciate brother
[11:03] Chad and also um brother
[11:07] Manuel um he is away um he's actually
[11:11] preaching in uh
[11:15] um California this
[11:18] morning um I forget the the town slips
[11:23] my mind um but he he said that he'd be
[11:27] streaming or maybe catching a service
[11:29] cuz they're 3 hours ahead so definitely
[11:32] want
[11:33] to uh remember brother
[11:36] Emanuel um just a prince of a man and so
[11:40] we trust that uh God would bless um uh
[11:44] his efforts and then bring him back uh
[11:47] safely uh home to us and then uh and
[11:51] then I think uh he's going to be uh
[11:54] behind the pulpit uh Wednesday again so
[11:57] looking forward to that and so trust
[11:59] that um God will bless him and refresh
[12:02] him um so if we could I I would like to
[12:07] uh read out of the Book of
[12:10] Joel and uh just got
[12:13] uh some slides I'd like to share with
[12:16] you trust by the help of the Lord he
[12:21] would uh be my helper uh this
[12:25] morning and
[12:28] um appreciate
[12:32] uh the Lord
[12:34] Jesus and um I'd like to read uh out of
[12:38] the Book of Joel uh first
[12:50] chapter
[12:52] um and
[12:54] Joel
[12:56] um let's see how do we do here well
[13:01] from the beginning here we
[13:04] go and um Joel chapter
[13:07] one
[13:09] um the word of the Lord that came to
[13:13] Joel the son of pul hear this
[13:18] oh ye old men and give
[13:21] ear uh all ye inhabitants of the land
[13:24] hath been this this beath been ha this
[13:29] been in your days or even in the days of
[13:33] your
[13:35] fathers tell ye your children of it and
[13:39] let your children tell their children
[13:42] and their children another
[13:44] generation that which the Palmer worm
[13:48] hath left hath the Locust eaten and that
[13:51] which the Locust hath left hath a
[13:54] cankerworm eaten and that which the
[13:57] cankerworm hath left hath the
[14:00] caterpillar eaten and then if we could
[14:03] go to the second chapter in the 25th
[14:08] verse it says and I will restore to you
[14:15] the years that the Locust hath eaten the
[14:18] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[14:21] Palmer worm my great Army which I sent
[14:26] among you and uh I'd like to speak to
[14:29] you this morning uh by the help of the
[14:32] Lord on uh the heartache of a veteran
[14:36] let's just bow our
[14:39] heads precious Lord just
[14:43] grateful
[14:45] for the honor and privilege it is to be
[14:50] in the house of God this
[14:52] morning and thankful Lord
[14:56] for my brothers and sisters of light
[14:59] precious Faith gathered Lord under the
[15:02] banner of your word Lord in a a dark
[15:07] hour but so grateful that we have light
[15:10] in our
[15:11] dwellings and so as we gather around
[15:15] your word I pray Lord that you would
[15:20] have the
[15:21] preeminence and that you would have
[15:23] first place in every heart you'd have
[15:26] first place behind this pull pit Lord
[15:29] and that what would be said this morning
[15:33] would be a help to each one Lord I I
[15:36] just want to yield to you is all I know
[15:39] how surrender to you and ask that you
[15:42] would help me to speak your word and
[15:46] your word alone God I I pray that the
[15:51] great Holy Spirit would bind my mouth if
[15:53] I wouldn't say something in an offence
[15:57] or out of your word
[15:59] Lord give me courage to speak whatever
[16:02] you had once spoken I I will
[16:06] certainly be a fool for you this morning
[16:10] we commit this service into your hand
[16:12] and each one Lord asking blessings upon
[16:17] brother Chad brother
[16:20] Emmanuel brother Emmanuel ministering
[16:23] soon and I I don't know brother Chad is
[16:26] done or on his way I know he's coming
[16:28] coming close to the end and so wherever
[16:31] he is at in this journey we're just
[16:34] asking a refreshing Lord of your spirit
[16:37] and your hand of mercy of traveling be
[16:40] upon him and we just pray that you watch
[16:42] over him and his children as well Lord
[16:47] we commit all we are into your hands we
[16:49] love you we praise you and we ask these
[16:52] things to be so in the name that's above
[16:56] every name our Lord and savior Jesus
[17:00] Christ amen God bless you can be seated
[17:04] if you
[17:05] like and uh a um thinking of
[17:12] um
[17:14] uh um a veteran um and no doubt as we
[17:21] read in Joel that um there was this
[17:24] great Army that was um um
[17:29] coming against and um we all know as
[17:33] Believers that we're all in a
[17:37] battle and um you know um uh before I
[17:43] get too far into it I I certainly want
[17:47] to um give a little Rose Bud to the
[17:54] veterans of old I I don't know how many
[17:59] uh old veterans do we got here in the
[18:00] house of God anybody yes praise the Lord
[18:04] and so I appreciate uh each uh sacrifice
[18:11] that has been given and so thinking of
[18:13] veterans we certainly want to uh
[18:17] acknowledge the sacrifices that they
[18:19] have given and uh certainly love and
[18:22] appreciate you and that's why we get to
[18:24] enjoy the freedoms that we share this
[18:27] morning how many appreciate that am and
[18:30] so um we uh are grateful this morning
[18:35] for um those ones that were on the
[18:38] battlefield but uh today and this
[18:41] morning we're going to look at um a
[18:44] different Battlefield and so uh we
[18:48] whether we want to or not we're all uh
[18:52] in a battle we're all in a fight and uh
[18:56] as the Bible tells us uh um we are not
[19:00] just to be soldiers but we supposed to
[19:03] be good
[19:04] soldiers and uh to do in hardness as a
[19:08] good soldier that's what God has called
[19:11] us for he's chosen us to be one of those
[19:14] good soldiers and uh no doubt uh it it
[19:18] can be a struggle at times to fight the
[19:21] good fight of Faith um you know it's not
[19:25] a um a easy Road and
[19:29] uh in this battle for
[19:31] restoration um God told us that he would
[19:35] ReStore in this last day and um we uh
[19:41] lot of times uh we we want to see a true
[19:45] restoration of God's word is that right
[19:49] and um but in this modern day that we
[19:52] live in a lot of times uh it's not
[19:55] restoration but it's uh uh um uh
[19:59] Improvement right that's that's that's
[20:02] uh kind of the ladyo see and age they
[20:05] they they take a classic and they want
[20:06] to modernize it they want to improve on
[20:09] it and and and we we see that same thing
[20:13] reflected uh spiritually uh in the house
[20:16] of
[20:18] God that that that's what we all fight
[20:20] against and uh no matter uh we may not
[20:23] say well brother Gabe I like the you
[20:25] know I like the 60s but but you know
[20:27] whenever it's time for
[20:29] restoration uh we like putting our
[20:31] little touches on
[20:36] it oh come on now right we we we got we
[20:41] got something in our in our our favorite
[20:44] vehicle and what we love and but you
[20:46] know we we we just want to do a little
[20:49] tweak here and and and just a little
[20:52] tweak there and and uh unfortunately uh
[20:57] we all have that when it comes to the
[20:58] the Christian
[21:02] experience thank you uh those of you
[21:05] that said
[21:07] amen the rest of you before you say am
[21:10] man you need to
[21:12] repent cuz I I'm not preaching to Angels
[21:16] this
[21:18] morning we we we all uh want to uh do a
[21:22] little tweak here and we know uh because
[21:26] we like it our way is that right but but
[21:30] God has called us to take what has been
[21:35] corrupted and to have a true
[21:39] restoration that it goes back to the
[21:42] original right we don't want to adding
[21:44] not one thing to it we we don't even
[21:46] want to put the fuzzy dice on the mirror
[21:49] right we want it original amen just like
[21:52] it came from the factory and and you
[21:55] know we we we we think of this and and
[21:58] in this message there there's so many uh
[22:01] offshoots and so many uh ideas and and
[22:05] and there's so many different fandangled
[22:07] things but I I love what the prophet
[22:10] said uh in a a man running from the
[22:12] presence of the Lord he he he took the
[22:15] Mysteries and he made it so real brother
[22:18] bam says he
[22:19] says in uh man running from the presence
[22:22] of the Lord he says now watch what he
[22:24] says may all the great Mysteries that we
[22:28] are supposed to know at this age Lord be
[22:30] unveiled to
[22:32] us amen and we'll see the plainness of
[22:37] God Amen so so the revelations ought to
[22:42] make what yeah Christ plain to us so so
[22:47] if we have a revelation of
[22:50] complication that's not the
[22:53] Mysteries but but the revelations ought
[22:56] to bring plainness of Christ
[22:59] amen but but watch what he says he says
[23:02] so that we'll
[23:04] know what's the mystery supposed to
[23:08] do so that we'll know how to behave
[23:15] ourselves
[23:17] sir an
[23:19] act correcting
[23:24] ourselves and bringing the members
[23:29] of our body into discipline to the
[23:32] word that we might know how to live in
[23:36] this present day at the approaching of
[23:39] the Lord Jesus so in this message in
[23:44] this seven seal book of redemption
[23:46] that's been Loos to us in this
[23:49] day
[23:51] yes it ought to bring
[23:56] plainness and it ought to bring us to a
[24:01] realization of the incorrect parts of
[24:04] our
[24:07] body and it ought to bring our members
[24:11] of our body into discipline to God's
[24:15] word
[24:16] amen and and if that message brings
[24:20] anything else we're looking at it
[24:25] wrong you know we we all want the
[24:29] Mysteries but but really in essence we
[24:32] ought to look and say what are the
[24:34] Mysteries doing for
[24:36] me where am I at in my Christian
[24:40] experience and and and and if it's and
[24:43] and and if we're falling short then then
[24:45] maybe we need to real maybe we need to
[24:47] take a second look and go wait a minute
[24:49] maybe I don't see the Mysteries like I
[24:53] should you know because in this in this
[24:56] hour there's there's so much
[25:00] um
[25:02] uh so many
[25:04] offshoots
[25:06] right and and and in this movement we're
[25:11] we're we're more broken up uh and
[25:14] there's so many uh ideas and and my you
[25:18] know if there was 900
[25:21] denominations uh in the prophets day
[25:23] well how many do we have amongst our own
[25:27] ranks right but but but we only have one
[25:32] message and we only have one
[25:35] Bible and and so it those those seals
[25:38] that have been revealed it ought to show
[25:41] us the plainness of God Amen so so if
[25:45] the Mysteries being anything else than
[25:49] the plainness of God yes it that means
[25:52] it ought to be Clarity yeah amen right
[25:57] and and and if it and if if it doesn't
[25:59] bring Clarity then something's wrong
[26:01] with us
[26:04] yes brother Bram tells us he says in the
[26:07] first seal he says here's the plan of it
[26:09] the first thing that happens there is an
[26:12] announcement in the heavens first what
[26:14] happens a seal is open what is that a
[26:17] mystery is unfolded see and when a
[26:20] mystery unfolds then a trumpet sounds it
[26:24] declares a war or a plague Falls and the
[26:28] church age open see what is the war part
[26:31] now watch cuz remember we're talking
[26:33] about what the heartache of a
[26:38] veteran he says what is the war part the
[26:42] angel of the church catches the mystery
[26:45] of God not fully yet revealed but when
[26:49] he does he catches this mystery of God
[26:53] and then he goes forth to the people
[26:56] after the mystery has been given given
[26:58] to
[27:02] him now why is it that some people say
[27:05] the mystery ain't been
[27:09] given
[27:12] right he says Goes Forth to the
[27:16] people what does he do do out there he
[27:20] begins to Proclaim that message and what
[27:23] does it
[27:24] start a war yes a
[27:29] spiritual
[27:31] war and all of us this morning are in
[27:35] the midst of that spiritual
[27:37] war young and old alike we we come and
[27:41] we have our Sunday Best and there's no
[27:44] camouflage there's no combat boots right
[27:49] that there's no there's no AR-15s in the
[27:51] house of God I I don't think uh right
[27:56] and and and but yet yet we are all
[27:59] sitting here in a spiritual
[28:01] battle because we know how many believes
[28:04] that the seals have been
[28:06] revealed right and so and so that
[28:09] declares to us a war and all of us
[28:13] whether we want to be or not we have to
[28:15] realize that we're veterans on the
[28:18] battlefield and some of us have been on
[28:21] the battlefield longer than
[28:24] others but those that are seasoned
[28:27] veterans
[28:28] those are the ones we ought to look to
[28:30] yeah the Saints of gods that that that
[28:32] have that have that have been you know
[28:35] you know the thing of it is is you you
[28:36] look at some people some people uh they
[28:40] love to
[28:42] fight you know and and you think about
[28:45] it in in in in in just our human ability
[28:49] we are naturally prone to lean one way
[28:52] or the another we're either in flight
[28:55] mode or we're in fight mode yeah right
[28:59] when there's any type of a confrontation
[29:02] or or any type of a of a struggle or
[29:05] something happens that adrenaline gets
[29:08] to pumping and what
[29:10] happens you got well they also say you
[29:15] get in Frozen
[29:16] [Laughter]
[29:18] mode right right you you now one of one
[29:23] of the other you are going to be prone
[29:26] to uh whether whether you whether you
[29:29] want to or not because we we
[29:33] all we all have one of the
[29:37] other right where when something happens
[29:42] something inside of you you have no
[29:44] control of it it's an unconscious thing
[29:47] that unfortunately my nature my makeup I
[29:51] ain't got no flight in
[29:53] me my flight is sitting over there in
[29:56] the fifth row the third seat
[30:05] over see we was we was on we were coming
[30:09] to church this morning and my little one
[30:11] say sh I want to sit on the end and and
[30:13] wifey goes no I want to I don't want to
[30:15] sit on the end see cuz she don't want
[30:17] nothing part of that outside Road she
[30:21] she she she wants to be hidden and
[30:24] protected and hid away right but but
[30:28] I I don't know some of us we we ain't
[30:30] got no flight in
[30:32] us and you know that sometimes there
[30:35] it's really not a good thing to
[30:39] have I I just I just be honest with you
[30:43] I struggle with
[30:48] it cuz you know I'm I'm pretty laid
[30:52] back what you laughing what you
[30:56] mean what you mean brother look at look
[31:00] you see what I see I said you look see
[31:02] automatically like hold fast what you
[31:04] mean
[31:07] brother I'm pretty laid back brother
[31:10] John Amen
[31:15] brother but but there's something on the
[31:18] inside of me that that the moment I see
[31:22] some type of Injustice or something
[31:25] that's wrong I I I am automatically
[31:30] fight right there just something in me
[31:33] where I'm just I'm a protector when it
[31:36] when it when it comes to uh I don't care
[31:38] who anybody that that I love or somebody
[31:40] that loves me brother I go to the ends
[31:43] of the world for you don't matter seek a
[31:46] swim let's
[31:47] go but but that's not always the right
[31:53] way but there can also be the opposite
[31:58] of
[31:59] that to where you are always
[32:05] flight that any time there's a situation
[32:08] that
[32:10] arises you're gone in the
[32:13] wind right and listen you have to be
[32:17] honest with yourself and go you know
[32:18] what that's not healthy either oh yeah
[32:21] because you can't run your whole
[32:24] life you say well that's just my nature
[32:28] but remember we want the nature of
[32:31] Christ to have
[32:32] preeminence in our lives and so it can't
[32:36] just be fight and it can't just be
[32:40] flight but but there there has to be a
[32:43] balance in it all that we can be honest
[32:46] with
[32:47] ourselves hello and look into the mirror
[32:50] of God's word and say God I need your
[32:54] leadership in every aspect of my life
[32:58] life that's why we have to be
[33:00] surrendered and yielded because I don't
[33:04] know about you but but suffer yourself
[33:07] to be
[33:10] defrauded oh excuse
[33:17] me right oh my that's that's a rough
[33:21] scripture for
[33:22] me right cuz you taking something that's
[33:25] mine what you
[33:26] mean
[33:28] but the Bible tells
[33:30] us the Lord Jesus tells us that when
[33:34] your
[33:36] enemy take something from you what you
[33:39] supposed to
[33:40] do you supposed to peel off the coat
[33:48] too right but but you know you know
[33:51] sometimes we we we can we can be in in
[33:54] such a passive mode to where we end up
[33:58] always trying to advert the
[34:02] battles and that's not right
[34:05] either because because if you're
[34:07] constantly pushing things off I don't
[34:09] want to you know you know here's the
[34:11] here's the thing here's the problem we
[34:14] we we in life we
[34:18] um watch what brother brah
[34:21] says brother BR says now let let them
[34:25] soak down into that church that copper
[34:27] WI that's a conductor now aluminum wire
[34:31] isn't a conductor see it is it isn't a
[34:34] rubber hose isn't a conductor it's a
[34:39] insulator wood an
[34:42] insulator we don't want any
[34:48] insulations we got too much of it
[34:53] now and it makes
[34:56] isolations
[35:01] so let's let's let's let's let's let's
[35:05] pretend this is
[35:10] BCF
[35:13] right oh
[35:16] my and you know sometimes listen you
[35:20] know you know the thing of it is is
[35:21] ain't you glad you you you you you start
[35:25] getting free of the cares of this world
[35:28] and man you start you you you got
[35:30] integrity and you got work ethic and man
[35:33] so you know what you just start climbing
[35:36] the corporate
[35:40] ladder yes sir I mean I mean nowadays
[35:43] you just show up and pass a drug test
[35:47] you you're you're in management position
[35:49] you
[35:52] know you understand what I'm saying
[35:54] right I mean hey but that's management
[35:56] material
[35:59] yeah you got to
[36:02] pause praise the Lord right and and so
[36:07] and so what what do we naturally become
[36:10] when we go to work every day Faithfully
[36:12] right no hangover on Monday and no no no
[36:16] uh always gone Friday and you know
[36:19] starting a party early
[36:21] and but he's faithful he works over he
[36:23] comes in early he no no back talk does
[36:26] what what he say what what what you tell
[36:28] him to do and right and and and and so
[36:32] and
[36:33] so we if if if you want to succeed in
[36:37] life being a Christian it's it's
[36:39] impossible for you to
[36:43] fail if you're failing in life you're
[36:45] doing something wrong because naturally
[36:48] unless you just God's got you there
[36:49] because you he's trying to get you to
[36:51] grow something but you understand what
[36:52] I'm saying but but the thing of it is is
[36:56] we can start we can can get a few years
[36:58] down the road from life and and and
[37:01] maybe that old life that we once had and
[37:04] we can we we can we can get a a a a home
[37:08] and and and we can you know get a wife
[37:10] and children and everything's going good
[37:14] we we pay our
[37:16] tithe amen and an
[37:18] offering and and we ain't looking to cut
[37:21] corners and you know play paying on the
[37:24] on the growth on the net but we paying
[37:27] on on the is that right paying on the I
[37:29] always get them two maxed up whatever
[37:31] one cost you the most you pay that
[37:33] one right you ain't looking for a way
[37:36] out and and and and you're faithful in
[37:38] tithes and faithful in offering and and
[37:41] and and and you know missionaries and
[37:44] always wanting to help in the house of
[37:45] God and giving up your time and all
[37:47] those different things and naturally
[37:50] you're going to be blessed
[37:52] yes right you you good to your children
[37:56] and you got family devotions and all
[37:58] these different things and always
[38:00] faithful in the house of God and but but
[38:02] the thing of it is
[38:05] is if we ain't
[38:08] careful we so we slowly start getting
[38:12] off the
[38:14] battlefield
[38:17] because we get
[38:23] insulated we live within our means we
[38:27] Don't Rock the
[38:31] Boat you know why cuz cuz we're
[38:37] comfortable but
[38:39] again because we don't want to be at
[38:45] War we want to
[38:50] be Rock
[38:53] AB live within your
[38:56] means
[39:03] and and and we we get our
[39:07] little we get our little F favorite
[39:13] group we got a handful of brothers and
[39:15] sisters we fellowship with we all get
[39:17] along we all like the same
[39:20] things right
[39:22] [Music]
[39:26] goodbye
[39:30] and then last year brother Gabe
[39:38] comes
[39:39] [Music]
[39:42] Rocka hey I'm coming up on we coming up
[39:44] on a year oh it's been so good I'm so
[39:48] thankful I love y'all I really do I so
[39:51] I'm so appreciate this
[39:52] church but you
[39:55] know here's
[39:58] we can get
[40:00] insulated and we got our little group
[40:03] our little
[40:04] niche right we got our little bill
[40:10] cycle week to week service to service
[40:16] and when we see that coworker we don't
[40:18] like we go the other
[40:21] way
[40:25] flight we we know that their routine so
[40:28] when they're here we're
[40:31] there we got it mapped
[40:34] out
[40:36] cuz we don't want no
[40:38] [Music]
[40:40] problems you you know what I realized in
[40:44] life I realize that the people that's in
[40:48] our lives that caus US
[40:50] problems are there for a
[40:53] purpose because if we just insulate
[40:56] ourselves with
[41:00] men how will we ever
[41:04] grow you remember what brother brandom
[41:06] said when he said when they had that tax
[41:08] case and he and they said well you just
[41:09] got a bunch of Puppets on your on your
[41:11] board trust him he said listen if I had
[41:13] a puppet I'd throw him off amen right he
[41:17] said if that man had a diff a different
[41:19] idea I got him there for that
[41:22] purpose cuz cuz even that Prophet didn't
[41:26] want yes men around him yeah but the
[41:29] thing of it is it's easy for us as human
[41:32] beings because we don't want
[41:38] confrontation and so what do we
[41:41] do we insulate
[41:45] ourselves and
[41:47] insulations
[41:48] creates
[41:54] isolations and that is not healthy
[41:58] what I found is the the people that rub
[42:01] me the wrongest those are the ones that
[42:03] I want around
[42:05] me and those that are coming to the
[42:07] house afterward please you are not the
[42:11] one brother Les looking at me like oh
[42:13] yeah
[42:22] brother hey yesterday brother Aaron he
[42:25] was working on my shoulder ain't you so
[42:27] glad there's so so many gifts in the
[42:28] body but Aaron is so next time he'll be
[42:37] like
[42:39] but but what I want what I'm trying to
[42:41] get you to understand is those people
[42:44] that rub you the wrong way are there for
[42:46] a purpose because if you do not have
[42:49] them there how are you going to see the
[42:51] flaws in your
[42:52] life how are you going to see the
[42:55] character flaws in your makeup
[42:57] those people are there for a purpose cuz
[42:59] they're there to expose
[43:06] them and so and so when when when I when
[43:09] you know when when I see those people
[43:12] and and whether it's on the job or uh I
[43:14] don't have any here
[43:16] please y'all are
[43:21] [Laughter]
[43:25] angels but what we need to do what we
[43:29] need to pull back the
[43:32] isolation the
[43:34] insulation because because
[43:38] remember
[43:41] you are the salt of the
[43:46] earth but that salt does no
[43:51] good in a salt
[43:56] shaker you can look at it see it looks
[43:58] nice nice white but but what ha that
[44:01] that that salt has to
[44:04] make
[44:07] contact and and if and if we are the
[44:12] salt of the earth then we must make
[44:16] contact that means we have to get out of
[44:20] our comfort
[44:22] zone and it's so easy for us to become
[44:27] so isolated and
[44:29] insulated that we lose our
[44:33] savior what that salt is is something
[44:37] that
[44:39] preserves if you take meat and you you
[44:42] back in the day way back before they had
[44:44] you know the frigidaires what did they
[44:46] do that salt they used that salt because
[44:50] it
[44:51] preserved and and if and and we want to
[44:55] put Jesus as the savior of the world but
[44:59] really you are
[45:03] that's
[45:05] am but the only way you can express that
[45:08] attribute of Savior is if you get out on
[45:11] the front line
[45:14] amen where we don't want to
[45:17] go we don't want to get
[45:23] hurt that's why we insulate
[45:25] ourselves that's why we isolate
[45:31] ourselves you know or or you or if if if
[45:36] you are a fighter by
[45:41] Nature then this message buddy you got
[45:43] all kind of
[45:46] ammunition you know you know i' I've
[45:49] seen I i' I've seen I've
[45:52] seen you know
[45:55] Brethren uh take this message and want
[45:58] to argue and fight and you know and and
[46:02] you you you how many y'all know what I'm
[46:04] talking about maybe some of you was that
[46:08] way right and but you know I got to
[46:11] thinking about
[46:14] it you know we can take this message and
[46:17] we can go around and we can go around
[46:19] killing
[46:23] people you know I I'm I'm going have to
[46:27] use I'm going have to use uh uh brother
[46:31] uh brother Benjamin's uh uh
[46:36] disclaimer this this is just me I I I
[46:39] haven't found a quote on it but you know
[46:40] I got to thinking if
[46:43] um let's say let's say there's somebody
[46:46] and they they just somebody that was
[46:47] good to the
[46:48] bride and they never are going to
[46:51] understand this message I wonder how
[46:55] many message Believers ran through the
[46:59] factory just wanting to fet everybody
[47:02] yeah amen right oh yeah I've seen it and
[47:07] you think you know I I'm not talking
[47:09] about looking for an excuse not to
[47:11] witness but but sometimes people just
[47:13] want to shove it down yeah amen right
[47:17] but but I wonder if we ought to be more
[47:19] prayerful about it right just like
[47:21] brother brandham said when brother Bram
[47:22] said he said he'd he'd go up to somebody
[47:24] and he'd talk to him for a little bit
[47:26] and what would what he do he'd fill him
[47:28] out he didn't just jump up and rip open
[47:31] Malachi 4 and goes that's
[47:33] me repent and
[47:38] perish no right amen but but what did he
[47:43] do he he he would he would he would sit
[47:45] with him talk with him and talk about
[47:47] fishing and you know and then all of a
[47:49] sudden slip in a little something about
[47:50] the Lord and then he'd
[47:52] wait that's right right then then if
[47:55] that and then what's he doing he'd be
[47:57] fishing and if that if that fish would
[47:59] nibble a little bit he he'd maybe wait a
[48:02] little bit and then he'd say a little
[48:03] something
[48:06] else I I wonder if we would take that
[48:09] approach how much more effective would
[48:11] our testimony be but but if we just go
[48:15] looking at somebody because they ain't
[48:18] like us but but what if what if what if
[48:22] they ain't like us because there's
[48:24] something deeper
[48:28] yes
[48:31] you a lot of times you know because we
[48:36] we we are uh we have the understanding
[48:40] that we have a lot of times we we we do
[48:44] a lot of
[48:52] damage you know we see
[48:55] somebody that's in
[48:58] I I I got that I hope you understand I I
[49:01] want you just to see the the iceberg of
[49:05] it because a lot of times we'll look at
[49:08] people and we'll just see the ice and
[49:09] we'll see what we see but we don't
[49:11] realize what's underneath the surface of
[49:13] that
[49:14] person
[49:16] right you know I was uh uh talking to
[49:19] brother Aaron uh uh yesterday and he he
[49:23] he was he he was working on my my my you
[49:25] know I've had been having some back
[49:27] problems and shoulder and neck and just
[49:30] been horrible and uh you know uh the
[49:34] older I get the more I realize the more
[49:36] sympathetic I am to the older
[49:44] ones yeah yeah let sister Virginia she
[49:49] laughing right you know because when
[49:51] we're young we just throw something off
[49:53] it ain't no big deal and we look at
[49:55] somebody hobbling along got to pain and
[49:57] they all how
[49:59] mean all Shake it
[50:03] off but you know
[50:07] sometimes there's things you can't shake
[50:10] off it's what you don't
[50:14] see and and if you ain't ever walked
[50:17] down that road of chronic
[50:19] pain you have no
[50:22] idea what that person goes
[50:25] through it may be everything that they
[50:27] can do just to keep a straight face when
[50:31] they walk and because they didn't smile
[50:35] at you somehow in your mind your
[50:37] imitation discernment wants to lay out
[50:40] the whole plan of cuz we got the message
[50:45] and right uh how many ever had the
[50:48] artificial
[50:51] discernment thank look old veteran back
[50:54] there brother B look old s first one
[50:56] hand up now the rest of y'all need to
[51:01] repent because why because we're under
[51:04] the influence of that eagle all of a
[51:07] sudden we always got eiz and we want
[51:11] we but let me ask you did you have a
[51:14] vision did that person come on your
[51:16] right side did did you grab a hand did
[51:19] you ain't got a scripture in there
[51:21] nothing but all of a sudden you want to
[51:24] explain the whole life and the situation
[51:26] when you you are only seeing the tip
[51:28] yeah amen of that Iceberg you you look
[51:32] at you look at God God has such a way
[51:35] you think about think about this when we
[51:38] look we like to judge one ver one person
[51:42] for what they are and what they done and
[51:44] what happened but we fail to realize
[51:47] that God don't just look at J Z he sees
[51:50] what that baby boomer did 50 years
[51:54] ago right and we we in our human Minds
[51:59] we all of a sudden on the battlefield we
[52:01] want to process and dissect and
[52:06] putting but if you if you really think
[52:08] about it we wonder why somebody gets
[52:11] away with what they get away with and
[52:12] you don't but you don't understand that
[52:14] person is laboring under something that
[52:16] they ain't even guilty of it was
[52:18] something great granddaddy
[52:22] did it's a family strain that's been
[52:24] haunting that lineage for Generations
[52:27] ations and we wonder why and you ain't
[52:30] got a
[52:32] clue I I talk brother brother Aaron he
[52:35] said he he he he told me he said yeah
[52:37] brother he said you got this problem
[52:38] here in your back and he said uh he he
[52:41] he he said it was uh I'm going to get
[52:43] all technical on you here watch this he
[52:46] said uh he said it was uh he said yeah
[52:49] brother he said it's your uh sympatic uh
[52:51] nervous sitting with the parasitic symic
[52:53] nervous system
[52:55] and you notice how I said that real fast
[52:58] like I knew
[53:02] how and so he was telling me that that
[53:06] you you you have a your Paras syic
[53:09] nervous system is your rest and digest
[53:14] response but your simp symp sympathetic
[53:18] nervous system is your flight or flight
[53:21] response and and and they were
[53:23] explaining that that's your Yin and your
[53:25] yang
[53:28] but but you can have something in your
[53:30] back that that is attacking that nervous
[53:33] you can have a
[53:35] trauma in your nervous system that
[53:39] always keeps you in flight or flight
[53:42] mode and your body doesn't get a chance
[53:46] to rest because of that trauma in your
[53:52] body and that person just wants
[53:59] rest but because of
[54:03] trauma that has
[54:05] happened deep down inside that that
[54:08] person has no control
[54:10] of it keeps him in that flight or fight
[54:15] mode and it's crying for
[54:18] rest and rest is
[54:25] evaded
[54:27] and that person don't want you to judge
[54:32] him what that person wants you to do is
[54:35] put a strong hand of
[54:39] faith and start working on that
[54:45] trauma oh it it's not
[54:48] easy but if we can work on that
[54:51] trauma then we can get that deep down
[54:54] inside something at
[54:58] rest so that it's not always in flight
[55:01] or flight
[55:03] mode amen right you you you you say
[55:06] brother Gabe what look you you you you
[55:08] think about this let let me let me just
[55:11] show
[55:12] you uh wh watch watch what I I found it
[55:16] says
[55:18] here it says the the parasynthetic
[55:21] nervous system is famous for controlling
[55:23] the rest and digest functions of the
[55:25] body
[55:26] the Paras sythetic nervous system is the
[55:29] yin to the sympathetic sympathetic
[55:32] nervous system Yang and work in tandem
[55:35] with each other when a stress occurs a
[55:37] sympathetic reaction allows our body to
[55:40] respond after the bodies have
[55:42] accomplished the task the parasitic uh
[55:46] uh must bring the body back down to
[55:48] normal or to a state of
[55:52] hematosis watch it says the disconnect
[55:55] occurs because the parasynthetic nervous
[55:58] system is essentially turned off which
[56:00] means they are in Flight fight or flight
[56:04] constantly this is what leads to a lot
[56:07] of elevated
[56:09] behaviors and they were talking about uh
[56:12] children how they can be in this they
[56:14] can have this trauma and and it puts
[56:16] them in this elevated and and and and in
[56:19] this get them you know ADHD and all
[56:22] these different things that that attack
[56:23] them but but if but if they can uh uh
[56:26] diagnosed this this nervous disorder it
[56:30] can put him
[56:31] at
[56:36] rest
[56:38] now um I I
[56:42] was I was thinking about this and uh be
[56:46] before brother Aaron came you know I was
[56:49] looking at this fight ORF flight uh
[56:52] response and and I asked the Lord uh
[56:55] Lord where is it
[56:58] scripturally and and and uh and and then
[57:01] I wanted to quote on it and I uh um
[57:04] scripturally it's actually in
[57:07] Philippians um Philippians
[57:10] 4:6 it says be careful and that means
[57:13] anxious careful means anxious so if I
[57:16] could say be anxious or careful for
[57:19] nothing but in in everything by prayer
[57:22] and supplication with Thanksgiving let
[57:25] your request be made known unto God and
[57:29] the peace of God which passes all
[57:34] understanding
[57:36] shall
[57:38] keep your hearts and Minds through
[57:41] Christ
[57:42] Jesus and it was so beautiful I I love
[57:45] God's word when when you look at just
[57:48] that one word it is explodes of keep it
[57:52] means to keep with the Garrison
[57:56] to guard Protect by military guard
[58:01] either to prevent
[58:03] hostile
[58:05] Invasion
[58:07] fight or to keep the inhabitants of the
[58:10] besieged city from
[58:17] flight oh my you know here's the thing
[58:20] listen I'll just be honest with you I
[58:21] ain't smart enough to search the Bible
[58:23] and finding stuff friends I but but but
[58:26] God is so faithful that if if you'll
[58:29] just pray and ask you know God will will
[58:33] direct your footsteps into his word and
[58:36] it just it just so blessed me that that
[58:39] that God would show it that that if the
[58:43] peace of God which passes all
[58:47] understanding that is what's going
[58:49] to keep
[58:52] you it's going to keep you at rest so
[58:56] that you're not in fight mode and that
[59:00] you're not in flight
[59:03] mode but you can be at
[59:06] rest because really isn't that how we're
[59:09] supposed to fight the
[59:13] battle isn't that how a real Soldier
[59:15] fights you know you know I I I I was I
[59:19] was
[59:20] uh I was uh after the Lord showed me
[59:24] that scripture it was Saturday more or
[59:27] Friday night and I asked the Lord I was
[59:29] like Lord I said I where's the quote at
[59:31] I I want to I want a quote Lord I I I I
[59:35] I want to understand and you know I I
[59:39] took a quote that that I had already
[59:41] seen and I put it in in in here and then
[59:46] uh I was looking at it and then brother
[59:48] Aaron came over and he started talking
[59:50] about those two nervous systems and when
[59:53] he started talking to him I I I said oh
[59:55] brother I said preach brother keep
[59:57] preaching
[59:59] what I said keep preaching brother he's
[1:00:01] over there cranking I
[1:00:05] oh but but watch what brother brandom
[1:00:07] says this is so beautiful he says now
[1:00:10] how many knows brother Ben on on the
[1:00:13] tapes you know the loud one front row
[1:00:15] always laughing cutting up right that's
[1:00:18] brother Ben I love brother
[1:00:20] Ben watch he says Ben he said I ought to
[1:00:24] work on you bless you
[1:00:27] thank you brother Ben I love you I love
[1:00:29] you brother Ben if you know what that
[1:00:31] boy suffered for us in the war he shot
[1:00:34] all the pieces and blowed up and
[1:00:36] everything else he had a life of
[1:00:38] everything I want you to notice I did I
[1:00:41] I had this quote already in my my my my
[1:00:45] notes and then and then brother Aaron
[1:00:47] comes a few hours
[1:00:51] afterwards it's just it it may not mean
[1:00:53] nothing to you but it blesses me he says
[1:00:55] he says he's all shot to pieces and
[1:00:57] blowed up and everything he's had a life
[1:00:59] of everything but God blessed him and
[1:01:01] stayed true his wife left him run away
[1:01:04] married again took his children oh my I
[1:01:06] just can't think about it but anyhow God
[1:01:10] bless you Ben he's laying right now full
[1:01:13] of
[1:01:19] shrapnel
[1:01:21] pressing against his
[1:01:24] nerves
[1:01:27] and everything
[1:01:28] else watch what he said brother bam says
[1:01:33] which you have to know the background of
[1:01:35] things you see God bless that
[1:01:43] boy see somebody could look at brother
[1:01:45] Ben just loud mouth you know he ain't
[1:01:48] respectful he ain't what's he doing
[1:01:49] always laughing cutting up that's the
[1:01:50] prophet of
[1:01:54] God
[1:01:57] but brother brandham says you're not
[1:01:59] looking at it
[1:02:00] right right he he he's he's he's been on
[1:02:05] the
[1:02:06] battlefield and he suffered some trauma
[1:02:08] in his
[1:02:11] life and them wounds in his life is
[1:02:15] pressing his
[1:02:18] nerves it's always keeping him in fight
[1:02:21] or
[1:02:23] flight and the brother brandham says you
[1:02:26] have to know the background yes and
[1:02:29] friends what I'm what I'm trying to
[1:02:30] encourage you when you're on the
[1:02:33] battlefield maybe you ought to take time
[1:02:36] to know the
[1:02:38] background let let let's put our
[1:02:40] artificial discernment in our back
[1:02:43] pocket and let's sit across the
[1:02:49] table and you open your heart yes and
[1:02:53] then as the prophet of God taught us let
[1:02:56] that person open their heart am and
[1:02:59] that's what True Fellowship
[1:03:01] is and then we'll begin to understand
[1:03:05] the
[1:03:06] background then we'll begin to
[1:03:09] understand why they are the way that
[1:03:12] they are yes because a lot of times we
[1:03:15] just remember we are not called to judge
[1:03:18] on outward appearance but we're called
[1:03:21] to judge with righteous judgment and
[1:03:24] that means we have to take away all of
[1:03:26] our preconceived you know you know you
[1:03:29] know we as human beings we look at
[1:03:31] somebody instantly and we have a
[1:03:32] judgment on
[1:03:34] them that's just that's just human
[1:03:36] nature we we can see somebody in their
[1:03:39] face and we'll automatically
[1:03:41] subconsciously have them figured
[1:03:44] out and you know that person you're
[1:03:47] looking at is may not and you and you
[1:03:50] may automatically not like them because
[1:03:53] the way that they look and they ain't
[1:03:54] done nothing to you and you know the
[1:03:56] reason why you don't like them it's
[1:03:58] because they look like somebody that
[1:03:59] hurt you in your
[1:04:03] past that's just human nature friends
[1:04:06] that that's you you can Google it it'll
[1:04:09] I mean it ain't no deep Revelation
[1:04:12] that's just human nature and that's what
[1:04:14] we all fight against because uh somebody
[1:04:18] uh got a nose like somebody that hurts
[1:04:20] you and the moment you see that nose all
[1:04:22] of a sudden you're really to make it
[1:04:24] bigger
[1:04:28] right and now person ain't done nothing
[1:04:31] to you but it's because you had trauma
[1:04:34] in your
[1:04:44] past you you look at the
[1:04:47] [Music]
[1:04:49] um you you look at the
[1:04:52] um Good
[1:04:54] Samaritan
[1:04:56] is this
[1:05:01] okay
[1:05:03] 12:00 when you read about the Good
[1:05:06] Samaritan you know whenever he was when
[1:05:08] those wounds that he
[1:05:13] had uh you know he was going from
[1:05:15] Jerusalem to
[1:05:17] Jericho and brother brandham said that
[1:05:19] that he that that types a backsliding
[1:05:23] Believer right and he fell Amongst
[1:05:26] Thieves and he was wounded but if you
[1:05:29] look at that I love that wo look at the
[1:05:31] word wounded the
[1:05:33] wounds the the Greek word is actually
[1:05:36] trauma but I
[1:05:40] love the Perfection of God's word that
[1:05:42] he would so put words in there because
[1:05:46] this story is more than just a man that
[1:05:48] helped a man that was beat up on a side
[1:05:50] of a
[1:05:51] road because brother brandham takes that
[1:05:54] and he says that uh uh the man was left
[1:05:56] for half dead that means he was uh a
[1:05:59] backsliding condition and and that the
[1:06:02] Good Samaritan came and and uh poured in
[1:06:06] the oil and the wine right we know what
[1:06:08] the oil and wine represents and put him
[1:06:11] on his
[1:06:12] Beast right that eagled
[1:06:15] anointing you can see the types and took
[1:06:18] him to the end which is the house of God
[1:06:20] and gave him two pence see uh spirit and
[1:06:23] truth I mean you know just on on and on
[1:06:26] all the types and shadows of it but what
[1:06:28] I want you to what I want you to see is
[1:06:31] look at the beauty of the word that that
[1:06:34] simple word
[1:06:36] trauma the it says from the the base of
[1:06:41] uh T Rosco it means but watch to wound
[1:06:45] but it means it's akin to the base of
[1:06:49] three other
[1:06:53] words so these wounds
[1:06:56] are
[1:07:00] multifaceted so that trauma we can look
[1:07:03] and just labeled as trauma but it's
[1:07:06] actually deeper than that because that
[1:07:09] that those three words actually paint a
[1:07:12] very
[1:07:15] deep description of what that person is
[1:07:18] going through because those three words
[1:07:21] means to break in pieces shatter Smite
[1:07:27] through the other part
[1:07:29] is A Worn Path and the third part of it
[1:07:34] it means to Nash to squeak make a Str
[1:07:38] cry to Nash or grind one's
[1:07:43] teeth ain't that
[1:07:45] beautiful that that when God would put
[1:07:48] maybe some own private Revelation I
[1:07:50] don't know but but and when you look at
[1:07:53] it those three parts of that word that
[1:07:56] make up one word shows us that it was
[1:08:02] broken and a warm path how many's ever
[1:08:06] nashed their teeth and had a shrill
[1:08:11] cry when God is saying this man had
[1:08:14] those kind of wounds what's he telling
[1:08:18] us it was pain that was more than just a
[1:08:21] superficial
[1:08:23] scratch and we as Humanity we go through
[1:08:28] life and Trauma
[1:08:33] happens sometimes it's emotional
[1:08:38] trauma sometimes it's physical
[1:08:42] trauma sometimes it's psychological
[1:08:48] trauma right and sometimes it's
[1:08:51] spiritual
[1:08:52] trauma all those different elements that
[1:08:55] come with us when we're on our life's
[1:09:01] journey and sometimes we get
[1:09:07] wounded and the priest walks
[1:09:10] by but he walks on the other side you
[1:09:14] don't want to get his hands
[1:09:16] dirty the levite you know what that is
[1:09:19] that's
[1:09:24] bride
[1:09:27] Y and walks on the other side I don't
[1:09:31] want nothing to do with
[1:09:32] it flight
[1:09:35] mode but then there's
[1:09:38] somebody that's a
[1:09:44] veteran and when that person that Good
[1:09:48] Samaritan looks on that wounded
[1:09:51] soldier there's no
[1:09:54] scorn
[1:09:55] yeah there's no disgust yeah
[1:10:00] amen but it's
[1:10:03] actually a Heart full of
[1:10:07] Sorrow
[1:10:09] amen cuz that veterans been there
[1:10:17] before see he done took off the
[1:10:20] insulation and the
[1:10:24] isolation
[1:10:26] and he wants to make
[1:10:28] contact look the thing of it is friends
[1:10:31] too many
[1:10:32] times we have the message
[1:10:35] persona but I
[1:10:37] wonder if we would really be who we
[1:10:40] really are
[1:10:42] yes if we would take off the
[1:10:46] insulation and the
[1:10:48] isolation and stop stop trying to be
[1:10:51] something that we're
[1:10:54] not
[1:10:55] listen I want to make heaven and if I
[1:10:58] got to make myself a fool in front of
[1:11:00] you that's what I got to
[1:11:02] do cuz cuz if that if I got that much
[1:11:05] pride in me then that's what I got to do
[1:11:09] look I I I do not want to just I don't
[1:11:12] want to just barely make
[1:11:15] heaven but I want to come to those doors
[1:11:17] knowing that I fought a good fight I
[1:11:20] finished my course I made mistakes but I
[1:11:23] made them
[1:11:24] right
[1:11:25] right
[1:11:27] amen when when when when we go you know
[1:11:30] that Good Samaritan he can look at that
[1:11:32] person he can say yeah I've been there
[1:11:37] but I'm going to take
[1:11:40] time and what does he do he binds up the
[1:11:45] womb but then he pours in the Holy
[1:11:48] Spirit you can make
[1:11:50] it and then he pours in the wine which
[1:11:53] is what stimulation of Revelation
[1:11:55] ation right and he puts him on his own
[1:11:59] Beast that means he puts he has a burden
[1:12:03] for that person you know you know um
[1:12:06] there there's a there's a um you know
[1:12:09] when we're talking about old
[1:12:11] veterans you know you could be on the
[1:12:14] battlefield one day and technically
[1:12:16] you're a
[1:12:18] vet but I don't know if I want to fight
[1:12:20] beside
[1:12:23] you I want some old sold wrapped around
[1:12:26] me when we're on the battlefield I want
[1:12:29] somebody got some
[1:12:30] experience right I want somebody that's
[1:12:32] been down a few roads that's why listen
[1:12:35] I I love them old them them gray-headed
[1:12:37] ones them the ones I love I I love it
[1:12:40] because hey I maybe I can get some I can
[1:12:42] get some experience off of you may maybe
[1:12:44] I can learn a little something and
[1:12:45] bypass a few hardships to
[1:12:48] life cuz they done been down a few roads
[1:12:52] I look at brother Bob a old
[1:12:54] sage right yeah look at it he like oh
[1:12:57] brother but see that's what I'm talking
[1:12:59] about
[1:12:59] see yeah it's somebody look I I brother
[1:13:03] Bob been on my heart the whole time I've
[1:13:04] been studying this I can't get him off
[1:13:06] my heart but he done been down a few
[1:13:09] roads you see that man got a few
[1:13:12] heartaches but you know what whenever
[1:13:14] you whenever you're whenever you're
[1:13:16] going through a bad time it'll be some
[1:13:18] it would be one of them old sages that
[1:13:19] puts his arm around you and he'll hug
[1:13:22] you just a little bit longer than he
[1:13:23] normally does
[1:13:26] but you know why because them old sages
[1:13:28] done been down a few roads and they
[1:13:31] watch even when you ain't watching and
[1:13:33] they'll say a look and they won't have
[1:13:36] no artificial discernment but they'll
[1:13:39] know you know you know you know when
[1:13:41] when in when a in in the life of an
[1:13:44] eagle I was listening to a a a preacher
[1:13:46] I don't think he's even a message
[1:13:48] preacher I think his name was a Bobby
[1:13:49] Thompson brother Bobby Thompson and he
[1:13:51] preached on Eagles he loved Eagles study
[1:13:53] Eagles his whole life and
[1:13:55] he said that he said that one time he
[1:13:57] had met this uh Indian and this Indian
[1:14:00] took him down to somewhere in North
[1:14:01] Carolina and uh and uh and showed him
[1:14:04] something that when Eagles go through a
[1:14:07] moping period of
[1:14:09] life it's when they go through a state
[1:14:11] of
[1:14:14] depression all Eagles go through it he
[1:14:16] said and he said he said when those
[1:14:19] Eagles get in that state they stop
[1:14:22] Flying and they go down into a valley
[1:14:27] and and their beaks get crusted over and
[1:14:30] their eyes and they stop eating they
[1:14:33] don't fly like they used to they just
[1:14:36] hop around and because they ain't used
[1:14:39] to walking their feet get all swok
[1:14:42] up and you know he said he said but
[1:14:44] there's something that special happens
[1:14:46] during that
[1:14:48] time he says there's other
[1:14:51] eagles that will fly to that Valley
[1:14:55] and will
[1:14:56] drop fresh meat down to the ones that
[1:15:02] are in the
[1:15:04] valy they'll take out all of the bones
[1:15:08] and they'll chew that meat up like it
[1:15:11] would for a baby because their beaks all
[1:15:14] crusted and they can't eat but that
[1:15:16] eagle will chew it up and then drop it
[1:15:20] it won't it won't go down there but
[1:15:22] it'll drop it hoping that that another
[1:15:25] Eagle that's in that
[1:15:27] Valley of
[1:15:28] depression will pick that meat up and
[1:15:31] eat
[1:15:32] it but here's the amazing thing that
[1:15:35] that Indian told
[1:15:37] him he said the only Eagles that fly
[1:15:40] overhead and drop the
[1:15:42] meat is the old
[1:15:48] veterans he said the Young Eagles won't
[1:15:50] do
[1:15:52] it cuz they've never been down there
[1:15:55] right
[1:15:58] right but it's the old
[1:16:04] vets see old
[1:16:07] vets has done Ben to few hard
[1:16:12] roads they done been through a few
[1:16:17] valleys but they had an old vet dropped
[1:16:20] some food down to them
[1:16:23] right and now now they see that it's
[1:16:26] their
[1:16:27] time to drop some meat to somebody
[1:16:35] else I'm preaching to you this morning
[1:16:37] the heartache of a veteran it's not the
[1:16:40] seed of the scornful yeah right but it's
[1:16:44] the heartache of a
[1:16:46] veteran and if we would look it you know
[1:16:49] if we would look at the lost souls on
[1:16:52] the job
[1:16:53] place
[1:16:55] but look at them as lost
[1:16:59] souls on the job place we want to hold
[1:17:03] them to a message standard when they
[1:17:05] don't have no clue what a message
[1:17:06] standard
[1:17:08] is you don't know what that person been
[1:17:11] through you don't know the
[1:17:15] trauma that's affecting their nervous
[1:17:17] system on why they're always in fight
[1:17:22] mode well maybe now you know
[1:17:26] maybe you're the
[1:17:28] one instead of running the other way
[1:17:31] when you see
[1:17:33] them maybe you need to run to
[1:17:40] them see if we would
[1:17:45] really if we would really have a feeling
[1:17:48] one for another like we
[1:17:49] should if we would get past all the
[1:17:53] isolations of life
[1:17:57] if we would get to the
[1:18:03] place brother Bram says we only have to
[1:18:06] go through those schools of
[1:18:08] sufferings to know how the other fell
[1:18:16] Fields those stages of
[1:18:19] life but if we would step back a little
[1:18:23] bit and not not just look at our
[1:18:26] eyes but look at their shoes and then
[1:18:29] Step In Those
[1:18:35] Shoes amen step in your coworker
[1:18:40] shoes you know that family member that
[1:18:42] just rubs you the wrong
[1:18:53] way

[1:19:01] wrong maybe you need to look a little
[1:19:08] deeper
[1:19:09] [Music]
[1:19:14] um brother bam says
[1:19:18] this God leads his
[1:19:21] people through great trials to purge
[1:19:24] them
[1:19:27] and sometime it takes years to do
[1:19:32] it
[1:19:37] what and ask for myself tonight I
[1:19:41] believe that right now God is training
[1:19:43] such
[1:19:44] men to meet the front
[1:19:47] line men who are going to go through the
[1:19:51] time shook from their feet
[1:19:55] sometimes look like the whole thing's
[1:19:57] falling but yet in the midst of it all
[1:20:01] they know that the Living God they know
[1:20:04] that Living God and keep their face
[1:20:08] forward keep
[1:20:11] moving
[1:20:14] on
[1:20:17] years to purge
[1:20:23] yes
[1:20:37] some of y'all looking at me like brother
[1:20:38] Gabe turn that off before I break that
[1:20:44] camera
[1:20:49] dope
[1:20:51] years to purge
[1:20:53] him
[1:20:55] and we see that right
[1:20:57] there y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:20:59] look you see it
[1:21:08] changing right that's why Facebook look
[1:21:12] you think about what it three 2 three
[1:21:14] four 5 minute it can't go more than 3
[1:21:16] minute videos because
[1:21:20] why got children watching I saw
[1:21:23] something watching about cartoons and
[1:21:25] they do like the they change the scene I
[1:21:27] can't remember how many seconds and just
[1:21:32] constantly and it's making
[1:21:37] everybody
[1:21:39] right microwave fast fast
[1:21:42] f we ain't got
[1:21:45] time and and the thing of it is what we
[1:21:48] do what we some like brother Gabe I'm
[1:21:51] telling you I'm going to go up there and
[1:21:52] grab that clicker
[1:21:53] you
[1:21:58] here there you
[1:22:05] go but what it is it
[1:22:10] patience they that wait upon the Lord
[1:22:15] yes but we live in this nervous neurotic
[1:22:21] age and we're so caught up in our you
[1:22:24] know we're so caught up in our own lives
[1:22:27] we're so
[1:22:28] insulated we don't want to be on the
[1:22:31] battlefield and we do everything that we
[1:22:34] can in life to stay off of the
[1:22:37] battlefield and then we wonder why
[1:22:40] things just unexpectedly
[1:22:45] happen and then we get so frustrated
[1:22:47] because we've tried so hard to stay off
[1:22:51] of the
[1:22:53] battlefield
[1:22:55] but friends we are not called to get
[1:22:58] saved filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:22:59] then
[1:23:02] retire that's what we want right we want
[1:23:05] the white picket fence we want the house
[1:23:07] we want the three and a half children we
[1:23:09] want the dog name Fritz and uh
[1:23:15] right and we want everything paid for we
[1:23:18] don't want no problems we want no stress
[1:23:20] everybody we don't want no problems but
[1:23:23] friends
[1:23:24] no no M look the the the problem of it
[1:23:27] is we spend so many times outwardly and
[1:23:29] the problem is
[1:23:32] here no matter how well we get the bank
[1:23:35] account the job and all those different
[1:23:37] things and we can look at everybody else
[1:23:39] say this person got a problem that
[1:23:40] person this I'm stay away from him they
[1:23:41] got problem no you are the one that has
[1:23:45] the problem amen you are the one I am
[1:23:48] the one we are the ones and if we would
[1:23:52] spend less time trying to stay off of
[1:23:55] the
[1:23:57] battlefield and spend more time on the
[1:24:02] battlefield fighting
[1:24:06] with our
[1:24:10] Brethren what can I do for you amen what
[1:24:13] can I do brother you all right ain't
[1:24:16] seen you for a
[1:24:18] while just you you're doing okay you
[1:24:21] know I love you
[1:24:23] brother
[1:24:24] phone call
[1:24:26] text
[1:24:28] something that's what we do to
[1:24:30] fight it's encouragement this world is
[1:24:34] discouraging young people all the
[1:24:37] pressure that you're under oh my right
[1:24:41] it ain't
[1:24:42] easy
[1:24:45] but I I I I hope I hope I hope you
[1:24:49] understand that there's a process that
[1:24:54] we go
[1:24:56] through to get from there to
[1:25:00] there and it takes
[1:25:03] time there and I'm I'm closing but I
[1:25:05] just want to hit a few things there
[1:25:07] there's a process that we have to go
[1:25:17] through there is a
[1:25:23] process
[1:25:26] you know that sword
[1:25:29] Naturally Fit that man's
[1:25:32] hand
[1:25:35] perfectly but it would have fit in
[1:25:39] 33 but not
[1:25:43] perfectly and forgive me for I'm that's
[1:25:46] not I don't know I just tried my best to
[1:25:48] do the king sword get the little
[1:25:49] children a little
[1:25:50] illustration he said it was pearl handle
[1:25:53] with the G over
[1:25:55] and right
[1:25:58] silver but but the thing of it is it
[1:26:02] took that man 30
[1:26:05] years it took that man 30 years to come
[1:26:10] to a spot it took three phases of his
[1:26:13] ministry for him to grow to that
[1:26:17] position look naturally that sword fit
[1:26:20] his hand when he was a full grown man at
[1:26:23] 1933 when he is on the why didn't the
[1:26:26] king sword come then that's right cuz
[1:26:29] there was he had to come to where it fit
[1:26:31] his hand
[1:26:33] perfectly brother brandham had to have
[1:26:36] character so that he could wield that
[1:26:39] sword amen the right
[1:26:43] way and we listen friends there's only
[1:26:47] one sword and that's his word but I
[1:26:51] wonder how do we wield it
[1:26:55] how do we handle
[1:26:57] it do we have that peace that passes all
[1:27:04] understanding because if we don't have
[1:27:06] that peace we should never get on the
[1:27:12] battlefield because if we fight without
[1:27:15] that peace we are going to cause nothing
[1:27:18] but
[1:27:20] problems but when we can have that peace
[1:27:24] on the inside of
[1:27:28] us then that gives us the ability to be
[1:27:32] on the
[1:27:38] battlefield oh my I
[1:27:44] um I'm going to end with this I I uh oh
[1:27:49] man
[1:27:51] wow oh there's just not enough time
[1:27:55] um and we're going to close with
[1:28:02] this this is a very familiar
[1:28:05] scripture I'm sure no doubt most of us
[1:28:09] could probably quote
[1:28:13] it a man that hath
[1:28:16] friends must show himself
[1:28:19] friendly and there is a friend that
[1:28:21] sticketh closer than a
[1:28:26] brother but I want you to think
[1:28:32] about what your definition of friendly
[1:28:38] is and
[1:28:40] then I want you to see God's definition
[1:28:43] of
[1:28:50] it it's to be
[1:28:52] bad be
[1:28:54] evil be
[1:28:57] displeasing to be sad to be injurious be
[1:29:01] evil be
[1:29:02] Wicked to suffer hurt injury to do an
[1:29:06] injury hurt to do evil wickly mischief
[1:29:09] to break shattered to break broken to be
[1:29:12] broken broken in pieces be
[1:29:15] broken
[1:29:23] aund
[1:29:29] so if we really want to be friendly with
[1:29:32] each
[1:29:34] other what are we supposed to
[1:29:37] be
[1:29:41] broken
[1:29:42] shattered you know what that is that's
[1:29:45] being
[1:29:47] honest that's true
[1:29:49] friendship if you're really friendly
[1:29:51] with me you'll confide in me and go
[1:29:53] brother I
[1:29:55] just got this and
[1:29:57] that and we'll sit across the table
[1:30:01] friendly is not like we we think happy
[1:30:04] joke no no no
[1:30:07] no
[1:30:10] no he that hath friends must show
[1:30:13] himself
[1:30:20] broken just
[1:30:22] pleased
[1:30:25] you think wait a minute that that's
[1:30:27] totally that was your concept of
[1:30:34] friendly that was your Javelin with 22s
[1:30:38] on
[1:30:41] it right modified
[1:30:45] and but God's idea is the
[1:30:50] original just like it come from the
[1:30:52] factory M and what does that tell us
[1:30:56] friends if we want to be if we really
[1:31:00] how many wants to have
[1:31:02] friends right he that then what are we
[1:31:04] supposed to
[1:31:06] do we are supposed to say brother I'm
[1:31:08] just as broken as you are I'm just as
[1:31:12] sinful as you are brother but it's the
[1:31:14] grace of God that we are where we are
[1:31:17] amen I was just as shattered I was just
[1:31:19] as filthy I was just as
[1:31:21] undone look these young
[1:31:26] right what what are we supposed to do
[1:31:29] we're supposed to be friendly to him and
[1:31:31] say hey I've been there done
[1:31:36] that yeah it took me a while to overcome
[1:31:38] it too but you know what God was
[1:31:42] faithful and God will be faithful to you
[1:31:45] too that's a friend that sticketh closer
[1:31:50] than a brother a brother you don't have
[1:31:52] no choice in
[1:31:58] but it's when we're friends we
[1:32:00] choose
[1:32:03] amen and we ought to choose our friends
[1:32:07] wisely and we ought to realize if our
[1:32:09] true friends are true
[1:32:11] friends then we'll be friendly one to
[1:32:14] another and that means we'll let down
[1:32:16] every
[1:32:18] guard every
[1:32:20] facade go
[1:32:22] brother I'm broken you pray for
[1:32:26] me I'm struggling in this got this
[1:32:30] problem
[1:32:32] and can and then what what do you say
[1:32:35] well brother hey Hey listen let's let's
[1:32:38] fast over it let's miss a few meals
[1:32:42] let's consecrate ourselves to the Lord
[1:32:43] and pray God said that he would break
[1:32:46] our them yolks if we would fast
[1:32:50] and that's what the Bible
[1:32:52] says
[1:32:54] but the thing of it is is if we're going
[1:32:56] to be on the battlefield it's going to
[1:32:58] require
[1:33:02] sacrifice can we
[1:33:19] stand you
[1:33:22] know
[1:33:24] maybe you play something
[1:33:27] softly sometimes in
[1:33:34] life you know we look at John and we
[1:33:37] know John's the type of the
[1:33:41] Bride but John had a lot of fight in
[1:33:44] him the sons of Thunders him and him and
[1:33:48] James bu hey they had that Spirit of
[1:33:51] Elijah on
[1:33:52] them they ready call fire out of
[1:33:55] heaven cuz somebody wouldn't feed
[1:33:58] him right but but you know it wasn't it
[1:34:03] wasn't much
[1:34:04] longer afterwards that God began to
[1:34:07] break that man
[1:34:09] down you know when he went to that aisle
[1:34:11] of patmas things changed for
[1:34:14] him brother brandom said it took him two
[1:34:18] years two
[1:34:20] years you read that book of Revelation
[1:34:23] it surely don't take you two
[1:34:27] years two
[1:34:30] years but God has some purging to do on
[1:34:32] that man you say brother Gabe he already
[1:34:35] had the Holy Ghost I'm just telling you
[1:34:37] what the prophet
[1:34:37] [Music]
[1:34:40] said so I'm not saying you ain't got the
[1:34:43] Holy Ghost but maybe God's got you on
[1:34:45] the aisle of patment too cuz there's
[1:34:47] some pers need to be done to you but
[1:34:50] there's some pers need to be done to me
[1:34:53] I ain't in the seat of the scornful but
[1:34:56] what I'm saying
[1:34:57] is when when John got that Revelation
[1:35:00] you know what it did it didn't puff him
[1:35:02] up but it brought him
[1:35:05] low brother brother bham says brother
[1:35:07] bham
[1:35:09] says after he returned from the aisle of
[1:35:12] patmas only thing he could say was
[1:35:14] little children love one
[1:35:19] another he didn't hint about the seventh
[1:35:22] seal and
[1:35:26] but he found there was something real
[1:35:29] and that was the disciple that wanted to
[1:35:31] call fire down on the city and burn him
[1:35:33] up cuz they wouldn't give him nothing to
[1:35:36] eat something changed in that
[1:35:41] man that when he was on that a of
[1:35:44] patmas that two years probably broke him
[1:35:47] a little
[1:35:49] bit you imagine seeing a vision and wait
[1:35:52] 6 Months 8 months
[1:35:55] I wonder how often it
[1:35:57] was them Visions happen couldn't have
[1:36:00] been too often 8 n months span maybe got
[1:36:03] all of them the last one took him two
[1:36:05] years who knows what it was but man day
[1:36:08] after day hour after
[1:36:11] hour but God was M than a character in
[1:36:13] that
[1:36:14] man cuz whenever he had the opportunity
[1:36:17] where he could say what he wanted to say
[1:36:19] he had the character from that two-year
[1:36:21] Journey where he kept his mouth
[1:36:25] and sometimes we go through trials maybe
[1:36:27] takes years to do it but there's people
[1:36:30] in the Bible that we can look
[1:36:33] to you think Joseph when him Brothers
[1:36:36] threw him in the in in the
[1:36:38] pit I think the Bible said he was like
[1:36:41] 17 years
[1:36:43] old you know it wasn't until he was 30
[1:36:46] till he was at the right hand of
[1:36:48] pharaoh that man went through 13 years
[1:36:51] of Agony and pain
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:36:54] but what did it do it broke him down and
[1:36:56] mowed him and purged him gave him a
[1:37:00] character that when his brother's lives
[1:37:03] was in his hands he said don't
[1:37:06] cry God done it it was to preserve
[1:37:11] life and I'm telling you friends if if
[1:37:14] those veterans y'all know what I'm
[1:37:15] talking about cuz it's when we've been
[1:37:18] on the road and we've had some rough
[1:37:20] there's roads we've been down we
[1:37:21] shouldn't have went down a second time
[1:37:23] and we did
[1:37:24] did caused a lot of heartache and pain
[1:37:28] but when we go down the second time it
[1:37:30] sometimes it does something to you it
[1:37:33] gives you
[1:37:34] [Music]
[1:37:37] grit it gives you that heartache in that
[1:37:40] in that
[1:37:42] feeling that when you see others go down
[1:37:45] you say oh please don't go down that
[1:37:49] oh but when you see them go down that
[1:37:52] road you're waiting right there
[1:37:54] here cuz you know some point they got to
[1:37:56] come right back here and you go I'm
[1:37:57] going to wait for
[1:38:00] them cuz somebody waited for
[1:38:03] me see if we would enter into that kind
[1:38:06] of travail one for another if we would
[1:38:09] have that kind of feeling one for the
[1:38:13] other and when we go through those
[1:38:15] schools of suffering it's for a
[1:38:18] purpose it's to mold us and make us but
[1:38:21] it's also so that we can have the same
[1:38:24] heartfelt feeling that we can drop down
[1:38:27] a little handful of
[1:38:29] meat to that young soldier in the
[1:38:33] [Music]
[1:38:39] valley the heartache that we have and
[1:38:41] that we feel is for a
[1:38:44] purpose don't look at your life and say
[1:38:46] it was all it's vain there's no purpose
[1:38:49] why' I have to go through that look
[1:38:51] you're looking at it
[1:38:52] wrong
[1:38:56] let's bow our
[1:38:58] [Music]
[1:39:03] heads precious

[1:39:27] many but Lord we we want to be found
