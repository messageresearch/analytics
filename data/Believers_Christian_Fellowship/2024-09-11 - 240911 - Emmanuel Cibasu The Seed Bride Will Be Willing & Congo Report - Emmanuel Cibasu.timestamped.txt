[10:23] you may be seated just for a little
[10:25] while uh thanks brothers and sisters
[10:33] we are so happy to be this evening again
[10:37] in the house of the
[10:39] Lord and uh it's always a a
[10:44] little task on me to present a
[10:49] report I don't know if I will ever get
[10:52] used to it but we'll be able to try it
[10:56] uh this evening
[11:00] so again as
[11:03] uh most of us here know that I was away
[11:06] for about three three weeks actually 20
[11:09] 22 days in uh in the Congo it's uh in
[11:14] central Africa with brother Bley
[11:17] Williams so we we did get they were
[11:20] planning to go together but we didn't uh
[11:23] travel the same day because uh some
[11:27] hiccups came and
[11:29] uh Lord was able to put us together um
[11:34] just one one day apart so brother Franco
[11:37] okay it's already there that's uh our
[11:42] traditional uh slide for the Congo
[11:46] report so brother burle and I were
[11:50] supposed to leave on a certain Tuesday
[11:53] can remember August
[11:55] 13th and uh before just want to give
[11:59] that before we even get started so we we
[12:03] the the enemy attacks us already uh by
[12:06] Sunday uh brother Bley is calling me in
[12:09] the in the afternoon almost evening that
[12:12] you know what he could not make it on
[12:14] Tuesday because he's a self-employed uh
[12:18] uh contractor construction business he
[12:21] had something to finish up on
[12:24] Tuesday so I had to stay online with the
[12:29] airline companies for almost a couple of
[12:31] hours just to try to
[12:34] accommodate instead of him living on
[12:36] Tuesday he would live on Wednesday and
[12:39] these are three flights different
[12:40] flights schedulings so I had to stay
[12:43] there on on the phone for about a couple
[12:45] of hours on Sunday
[12:47] evening and so we were able to make the
[12:50] change which uh just for one day it cost
[12:52] us an extra $800 more just to Move It
[12:56] from Tuesday to Wednesday
[12:59] so that was on a Sunday so we're able to
[13:02] tackle that so I knew that I was going
[13:04] to be traveling on Tuesday by myself and
[13:08] uh brother Burley would be uh following
[13:11] on Wednesday usually takes about a day
[13:14] and a half to get there I would leave on
[13:15] Tuesday and arrive on Wednesday late
[13:19] late night and he would leave on
[13:22] Wednesday and arrive uh Thursday late
[13:25] night so Monday morning I woke up early
[13:30] I start uh um finishing up my
[13:34] packings so you will be able to see some
[13:37] of my packings
[13:38] afterwards and then um by 11
[13:43] a.m. a little thought came in my mind
[13:45] Hey go grab the your passport then I can
[13:48] have it ready
[13:50] so I I left my packings in the garage I
[13:54] went to check for my
[13:56] passport I couldn't find it
[14:00] I couldn't find it so uh just uh shook
[14:06] myself out of that I said I don't want
[14:07] to be nervous let me give us maybe
[14:09] another hour I'll go back and try to to
[14:12] find where I put it usually I can
[14:14] remember by memory where I put some uh
[14:19] documents in my in my closet so I
[14:22] couldn't U I couldn't find
[14:24] it and I kept on U packing and then a
[14:29] couple of hours I went back to check I
[14:31] couldn't find it I start combing all the
[14:34] documents I could find all the passport
[14:37] for my entire family but I couldn't find
[14:40] mine so a trial started that Monday
[14:47] afternoon I
[14:49] was
[14:50] shreding
[14:52] said what are we going to be doing
[14:55] because brother Burley we are just uh
[14:59] got his day fixed to be traveling on
[15:02] Wednesday he doesn't know the area he
[15:04] never been there so at least I must I
[15:07] have to be there but now I cannot find
[15:09] my passport so the entire day I combed
[15:12] every place looked almost every place I
[15:15] couldn't find my passport this was from
[15:18] afternoon
[15:20] until night time I called the airline
[15:24] companies I said um cannot find my
[15:26] passport would you be able to at least
[15:30] uh keep reschedule my trip maybe a
[15:33] couple of months later because even if I
[15:35] have to order a new passport it would
[15:37] take weeks I don't know maybe 8 weeks or
[15:40] 12 weeks so I called brother Berle I
[15:43] said brother ble I know that we're going
[15:44] to be canceling this this trip that was
[15:47] around 700
[15:50] p.m. and uh so it was just uh a hard
[15:53] trial on us so call those uh airline
[15:57] companies please hold on our tickets
[16:00] we'll see what we could do so we prayed
[16:03] together and uh I just know that uh I
[16:07] was going to be back here on Wednesday
[16:09] for service just let everybody know
[16:12] that we couldn't we couldn't make it I I
[16:15] lost my passport and almost at
[16:19] 10: at
[16:21] night when I knew that every every Hope
[16:24] was gone so I I I stopped even packing I
[16:26] said there's no need to to do that so
[16:29] uh it's those things that happened so
[16:32] some something just told me go in one of
[16:35] the the suits in the in the closets I I
[16:38] checked it almost everything I combed
[16:40] everything for some reason I went back
[16:42] to the same suit the second time and I
[16:45] just put my my hand in the pocket I was
[16:48] able to find my
[16:49] passport so it was
[16:52] almost close to 11:00 p.m. so we we I
[16:56] did call brother burle I said I know
[16:59] that we're going to be traveling brother
[17:00] Bley said it's going to be a good good
[17:03] it's going to be good
[17:04] meetings so that's uh what I went
[17:08] through that Monday it was a hard trial
[17:12] so just uh knowing that the enemy was
[17:15] attacking so they we're here and that's
[17:19] uh brother Burley so this is on Thursday
[17:23] so I arrived a day early on Wednesday so
[17:26] he followed up uh on Thursday after we
[17:29] picked him up uh from the airport so we
[17:33] uh we lodged at this brother's home
[17:35] brother Paul every time I go to the
[17:37] Congo he has accommodation so I can stay
[17:40] in his house has a bigger house he
[17:43] probably puts maybe five or six
[17:46] ministers there each in every room so
[17:49] he's a wonderful brother there so that's
[17:52] uh on
[17:54] Thursday and uh so I put this the
[17:56] ministry meaning that I have three
[17:58] sections once uh the ministry preaching
[18:02] and the second um section is uh what the
[18:07] church here and the people have
[18:09] contributed to help other churches in
[18:11] the Congo and the third one is just the
[18:14] charity among orphans and elderly widows
[18:19] and people that are in need so the
[18:21] ministry this is a first meeting we had
[18:23] I don't have too many pictures about the
[18:26] the meetings with brother Bley together
[18:29] but uh this is one of uh the the first
[18:32] meeting we had on a Friday evening at
[18:35] brother Rogers sorry that's the picture
[18:39] there uh brother Roger is on the far
[18:42] left close to
[18:44] me he he's been here twice with his wife
[18:48] he's a minister he's a pastor so we did
[18:52] speak at his
[18:54] church and uh this is the following day
[18:58] I think on a Saturday at the church you
[19:02] can recognize this is the church that uh
[19:05] BCF provided a roof and uh just to
[19:10] finish up the the entire building there
[19:13] so we had a wonderful meetings there on
[19:15] Saturday on Sundays I don't have a PCT I
[19:18] don't have pictures but um after we we
[19:21] got uh brother ble and I was translating
[19:24] we got uh speaking there so is there
[19:28] walk walking up the hill so we dropped
[19:31] him there we had a a car the car could
[19:34] not drive that little Hill there so had
[19:37] to come out uh get out the car could uh
[19:40] the driver could drive by himself and
[19:42] then we had to catch up so he completely
[19:45] worn out
[19:46] there
[19:48] yeah okay and on on Monday so we had um
[19:53] we had uh a day of rest so we went in
[19:57] town and then
[19:59] visited one of my uh biological brother
[20:02] so went to get pictures with some of his
[20:05] uh uh the guards at his place there and
[20:09] then we continued uh the meetings
[20:12] brother berley and I um the following
[20:16] week uh this was on a Tuesday on
[20:19] Wednesday we did I don't have a picture
[20:22] with brother very was speaking since we
[20:23] were at the pulpit so but this is the
[20:26] pastor um he's been in the US before a
[20:29] couple of times I did um interpret for
[20:33] him one time at the the voice of God um
[20:35] in
[20:36] Jeffersonville so we also spoke at his
[20:40] church uh but he he wanted two Services
[20:44] that's the reason I had to stay uh after
[20:46] brother B left to speak at his church on
[20:49] Sunday as well so I didn't want to let
[20:51] us
[20:52] go so then on
[20:55] Thursday we traveled uh to a nor
[20:59] northern northern Province Northeastern
[21:03] province of the Congo it just
[21:08] little video there so getting out of the
[21:11] airplanes
[21:13] um then then we had uh the pastor in
[21:18] town Pastors in town that came
[21:21] to to visit us in the hotel so that's in
[21:24] in town there
[21:29] very I cannot drive there very no it's
[21:33] uh kind of chaotic but uh so that's uh
[21:37] the church we we went to speak first on
[21:40] uh on the following day on
[21:49] Friday so the first two weeks brother
[21:52] Bley kept me busy because I did the the
[21:54] translation so after he left then I was
[21:57] able to to speak with with another
[21:59] translator as
[22:10] [Music]
[22:13] well yeah people are excited by the word
[22:16] of God and then uh that's at brother
[22:19] berle's
[22:21] um room there close
[22:23] to to the lake and uh him and I with the
[22:28] the pastor of the the church the one who
[22:31] invited us who brought in other
[22:33] ministers and these are some of the
[22:35] tablets uh the BCF I don't have probably
[22:39] I should have probably 12 that were
[22:41] given away but I have only a couple of
[22:43] pictures uh tablets with all the full
[22:47] messages uh given to
[22:51] ministers there and then after brother
[22:55] Bley left I did speak to a couple places
[22:58] uh
[22:58] at the this
[23:01] church and also we had um a how would I
[23:06] say outside um reach out um out campaign
[23:12] or something so did speak people came uh
[23:15] was on Tuesday we had uh because we had
[23:19] asked one of the church to call their
[23:21] neighbors so a lot of people uh came we
[23:24] could not contain them in the building
[23:26] so the Church decided to get the the
[23:30] chairs out so people could gather
[23:32] outside so we did speak that uh evening
[23:37] until it was late and um I think over 25
[23:41] people came uh came and gave their heart
[23:43] to the Lord yeah willing to embrace the
[23:46] message they were from other
[23:48] denominations but they were um me the
[23:50] pastor they said they're seeing clearly
[23:52] that the word of God is uh is the truth
[23:55] of the hour yeah so we stayed there
[24:00] almost until 9:00 so started probably
[24:02] 5:30 until 9:30 that
[24:05] evening and that's still the same
[24:11] place and then uh we did visit brother
[24:15] dooka who has uh this the brother in in
[24:19] the middle there he's preached here at
[24:21] the BCF before maybe 20 years ago 21
[24:25] years ago I think and uh so we did visit
[24:29] him but uh we didn't put him in the in
[24:31] our schedule we couldn't preach that
[24:33] this church it was too late so next
[24:36] time okay so that's uh Outreach um
[24:41] services and now we go to church support
[24:45] there's a there are a couple of churches
[24:47] that we provided a little funds just to
[24:50] help them instead of being outside under
[24:53] the rain they can just get inside so
[24:55] this is the little place so they have uh
[24:58] 10 roof and uh also the
[25:02] walls um a few people are meeting there
[25:06] twice a week and also on Sunday three
[25:09] times a week I would say a little place
[25:13] there and then there's another church if
[25:16] you remember I spoke to this place in
[25:18] June it was outside
[25:21] so uh the we did provide them with funds
[25:26] to get uh some uh little structure so
[25:29] people could be uh worshiping inside so
[25:33] they're building
[25:34] it uh that's the little
[25:39] place and uh then we had another area um
[25:44] among the refugees there are probably
[25:47] thousands of them so the church uh you
[25:50] remember this one the last time we went
[25:52] so we provided also the church BCF and
[25:55] um all your donations
[25:59] we provided
[26:01] the roof they are working on it and
[26:06] that's how it looks
[26:07] now actually inside and outside much
[26:12] different also provided with the benches
[26:15] sitting benches so people could come and
[26:18] gather inside this is uh uh the pastor
[26:21] and uh one of his
[26:23] deacons
[26:26] there beside that then we go to charity
[26:29] we have a couple of videos on the
[26:31] charity side is uh these among
[26:35] the the orphans and uh the elderly that
[26:40] are
[26:42] sick so that's uh my my room there in
[26:47] the garage so getting up preparing to
[26:50] get uh
[26:51] clothing and to be ship to be taken with
[26:54] me uh in the suitcases I don't take them
[26:57] in the boxes I just take them out of the
[26:59] boxes put in the suitcases and and uh
[27:02] pay for them
[27:04] so some people would recognize this yeah
[27:08] I know Priscilla seol could see
[27:11] that and her
[27:13] brothers and then so we also provided
[27:17] with the funds from the church and the
[27:20] donations the the brothers and sisters
[27:23] are among the the refugees couple of
[27:26] hundreds families we did provide some uh
[27:30] Provisions they they don't have any any
[27:33] income nor resources we did provide
[27:36] things like rice and beans and cooking
[27:40] oil and salt anything that's could be
[27:43] provided to them and probably soap and
[27:46] this is the pastor himself he's doing
[27:48] that with this little Transportation
[27:51] there he could do that maybe 20 times
[27:54] has to drive maybe in the mountains for
[27:56] probably 15 miles one way so has to come
[27:59] with this guy and pick up whatever they
[28:01] can pick go deliver but very um serving
[28:06] when you we were asking him how many are
[28:09] very vulnerable in the church maybe they
[28:13] don't have any means at all that we can
[28:15] focus on those he will tell you my
[28:18] entire church I want everything we we're
[28:21] we're receiving we want to divide to
[28:24] every each individual each family
[28:26] together so very very wonderful for
[28:28] brother so and these are the people that
[28:31] uh brothers and sisters that were lining
[28:34] up just uh before receiving the
[28:36] provisions for their families and uh so
[28:41] and they are all of them very grateful
[28:44] that we were there that you sent us that
[28:46] you did provide for them even in the
[28:50] natural so you provided a food for them
[28:53] and uh and above all the word of God we
[28:55] shared with them they are very very
[28:57] grateful
[28:59] for and um sell
[29:03] them that's a little orphanage was
[29:06] almost couldn't even look at it so we
[29:08] had to renew the paint and just to help
[29:11] some
[29:12] 46 kids in the area there were no
[29:15] parents at all so somebody was able to
[29:18] put them in a shelter so we were uh just
[29:22] trying
[29:23] to give it maybe a little little paint
[29:27] there
[29:28] inside and we also did provide over um
[29:32] 40 beds and 40 mattresses and food and
[29:36] whatever they have need of even uh
[29:38] school supplies because the schooling
[29:40] school is started last week so we were
[29:44] just a little help to them so see the
[29:47] kids sitting in their new beds
[29:50] there and uh so they are there saying hi
[29:54] to you guys and thanking you for sending
[29:57] us
[30:01] there and then there's a this sister um
[30:06] she is a daughter of a of a deacon in a
[30:10] certain Church in the
[30:12] area so she lost her hearing and Her
[30:16] speech when she was 3 years old because
[30:19] she had some kind of infection and then
[30:21] she never spoke and nobody had had
[30:24] helped her to learn the sign language so
[30:28] couple of times I went there I would see
[30:30] her sitting in the congregation in front
[30:32] there but not really moving just
[30:35] staring and then afterward I asked her
[30:38] father the father told me that's her his
[30:40] daughter and asked all her condition so
[30:44] he told me about her condition so what
[30:46] we did a couple years ago I did hire uh
[30:50] a tutor who can teach her a sign
[30:52] language and even teach her how to be
[30:55] able to write and uh I bought her a cell
[30:59] phone months back she but she lost it so
[31:02] I bought a new one with this cell phone
[31:04] she's able to communicate with with her
[31:06] family members now she can put words and
[31:09] she can tell them what she wants what
[31:11] they can communicate now so she's uh
[31:14] much more independent that they didn't
[31:16] even know what she could mean other than
[31:19] broken uh sign
[31:21] language so she she's
[31:24] happy yeah and this
[31:28] these are some of the Widow sisters and
[31:33] I know that some Widow sisters and some
[31:36] brothers and sisters he have uh uh given
[31:39] their donations to them and they were

[33:33] people that visit there she said every
[33:35] time you come here every all all the the
[33:38] patients are are excited just so you can

[33:43] the tablet there with the Charger and
[33:46] that's that's you they have to listen to
[33:51] it all right from there we went also so
[33:54] couple of orphanages I didn't put all
[33:57] the videos here but this is one of them
[33:59] also where we we
[34:02] visited those are uh they are from Italy
[34:06] and they are Catholic none they they
[34:09] help the people there watch over the
[34:11] orphans and
[34:13] elderly
[34:16] yeah and then we had a chance because we
[34:18] provided some beddings there for the
[34:21] girls even for the boys so I was able to
[34:23] go into one of the the girls' bedroom I
[34:26] said show me your bed just to make sure
[34:28] that everything was well done so I was
[34:30] sitting in on her bed together so with
[34:35] uh with the N with other kids
[34:53] inside so we're in a one of the the
[34:56] bedroom there so she did her bed bed and
[34:58] uh so we did provide the bed the pillows
[35:02] and the sheets and she was happy that uh
[35:05] we're able to provide that for for other
[35:07] kids as well and then we also did one
[35:12] place brothers and sisters providing for
[35:14] clothing and this is the area that um
[35:18] people have been
[35:19] displaced uh by
[35:21] Wars uh
[35:23] it's you you could just put you can
[35:26] never put your your mind around it's
[35:29] it's just
[35:31] beautiful so we went there and visiting
[35:33] brothers and sisters and we brought them
[35:35] some clothing and some food so they were
[35:38] there were together just letting
[35:40] brothers and sisters that send clothes
[35:42] that they arrived so we're able
[35:45] to to dispatch them to give them
[35:52] [Music]
[36:04] I'm troubled
[36:06] [Music]
[36:12] there so they fit everybody so so
[36:16] everybody got his size or her size yeah
[36:20] okay and beside that we also uh did
[36:25] uh some those Huts were too tiny
[36:28] we did help some of the Believers to get
[36:31] a
[36:32] little maybe accommodated some Huts that
[36:37] would make more sense to them so they
[36:40] can uh they can live inside with their
[36:43] families that's something big but just
[36:45] to help them
[36:47] to to Shelter From The Heat and from the
[36:50] rain and yeah some things like that
[36:58] after you see this we'll read the
[37:00] scripture here you will see that you are
[37:03] rich we are rich not
[37:05] only in uh in in in the cornal way but
[37:10] even in the spiritual way that's why we
[37:12] go there just to share as uh we might
[37:14] read it together this is in the book of
[37:16] Timothy I I finished up with it uh first
[37:19] of
[37:20] Timothy the reason we go there and
[37:23] probably we do what we doing um first
[37:26] Timothy
[37:28] chapter
[37:30] 6 thanks brother
[37:40] Franco chapter 6 verse1 17 says charge
[37:44] them that are rich in this
[37:47] world not only financially or materially
[37:51] but uh the word we have here is very
[37:54] rich for us charge them that are rich in
[37:57] this world that they be not highminded
[38:00] nor trust in uncertain riches but in the
[38:05] Living God who gives us richly all
[38:08] things to
[38:10] enjoy that they do good so Paul is
[38:13] speaking to those uh um um those Rich
[38:17] that they do good that they be they be
[38:20] rich in good works so although we're
[38:23] rich even in words we want to use the
[38:26] words to do good
[38:28] to to to distribute
[38:30] it that they be rich in Good Works ready
[38:34] to
[38:35] distribute willing to
[38:37] communicate laying up in store for
[38:40] themselves a good foundation against the
[38:43] time to come that they may lay hold on
[38:46] eternal life so as we go there not only
[38:49] for uh what we're doing for in for the
[38:52] charity as we go in the churches there
[38:55] to share the word of God we have we very
[38:58] rich fed in this
[39:01] place and just seeing what we have if I
[39:04] hold it something will burst within
[39:07] me we can take just a little subject
[39:10] very simple you take up there there are
[39:13] people that in the message but never
[39:16] heard about that and then the confession
[39:19] start opening up and people just
[39:21] receiving birth spiritual birth so we
[39:24] are rich not only materially but
[39:28] spiritually that's the reason we go
[39:29] there to do good works to distribute to
[39:33] communicate meaning to to share the news
[39:37] the gospel the message that we have all
[39:40] right God bless you thanks for U your

[40:12] Genesis chapter
[40:20] 24 should be familiar with this this is
[40:23] uh Abraham
[40:25] Abraham sending Al is or to fetch a
[40:29] bride a wife for his son
[40:42] Isaac let's read through verses then uh
[40:45] Genesis 24 let's read from
[40:50] 50
[40:53] 2455 56
[40:58] and this is uh elazar
[41:02] speaking and he said unto them speaking
[41:06] to uh Rebecca's family Rebecca's father
[41:09] mother and brother and he said unto them
[41:12] hinder me not seeing the Lord has
[41:15] prospered my way send me a way that I
[41:18] may go to my
[41:20] master and they said we will call the
[41:23] damsel and inquire at her mouth
[41:27] and they called Rebecca and said unto
[41:30] her will thou go with this
[41:33] man and she said I will go let's uh bow
[41:38] our heads and pray together precious
[41:41] Lord we or here
[41:45] father standing father on your
[41:49] promises that one of them said that
[41:52] where two or three are gathered in my
[41:54] name in their midst I will be and Lord
[41:57] we we have come to this Junction of the
[41:59] service father we were able to share uh
[42:02] little in a broken way uh the the trip
[42:06] how you protected and watched over us
[42:09] how father you answered the prayers of
[42:11] your beloved children here father
[42:13] praying for us day and night supporting
[42:16] us holding us father in their hearts and
[42:19] Lord we thank you for all that you have
[42:21] done for for us father and we thank you
[42:24] Lord that you would bless each and every
[42:26] one of them father for all this love you
[42:29] have uh just put within us now Lord
[42:32] we're turning to the reading of the
[42:34] scripture Lord you Al alone are the one
[42:38] who can interpret it for us and give us
[42:40] a portion a morsal of bread this evening
[42:43] that as we will live here father we will
[42:45] know that you have spoken to us and
[42:48] something father could just be
[42:50] beneficial to our walk we love you we
[42:52] thank you in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[42:55] amen God bless you may be
[42:58] seated so we're going to be taking a
[43:00] little scripture here um a little
[43:03] title the title is uh the seed bride
[43:08] will be
[43:11] willing it's a lot of will there the
[43:15] seed bride will be willing in the
[43:19] subtitle because this is too
[43:21] big I will go with this
[43:24] man you will see that Abraham and as we
[43:27] we'll read in Genesis
[43:30] 24 Abraham here is sending
[43:33] Eleazar meaning that he God gave him a
[43:37] promise of of a son and the son was born
[43:41] let's read it first so we can get the
[43:43] the the context of it and 24 let's start
[43:47] from the the uh verse one and Abraham
[43:51] was old and well stricken in age and the
[43:56] Lord had blessed Abraham in all things
[43:59] now as we're reading this chapter
[44:03] 24:1 Abraham is old here and well
[44:05] stricken for the second
[44:10] time for the second time he's been old
[44:13] before he's been well stricken before
[44:17] now he got
[44:19] renewed both now he's old again meaning
[44:23] he knows both side of the of the river
[44:27] so Abraham here is
[44:31] after God has had blessed him had called
[44:35] him he was old before and gave him a
[44:37] promise of a son and then we know how
[44:40] through the the the years Isaac was born
[44:44] now the time came that Isaac had grown
[44:47] up and uh Abraham remembered that his
[44:51] seed was to
[44:53] carry the generation to carry for uh um
[44:58] his his family so he is
[45:01] looking finding to find a wife for his
[45:06] son now he's not calling his son to say
[45:08] hey Isaac you come here I know you are
[45:10] at the age now it's time for you to find
[45:13] a mate for you no Abraham knows the best
[45:18] way to find a wife for his son he's
[45:23] omitting it to a servant the Elder of
[45:27] his servants and the prophet of God says
[45:29] that elzar represent the holy spirit so
[45:32] even as parents when we have our
[45:34] children at the age we can never even
[45:37] say hey I want you to marry this I want
[45:39] you to do this we have an
[45:42] elazar which is the holy spirit it's we
[45:45] are calling on the Holy Spirit dealing
[45:48] with him praying him sending the Holy
[45:50] Spirit you are the one who is entitled
[45:54] to find a mate for my son a for my my my
[45:58] daughter so Abraham is doing that as we
[46:02] we read won't read the whole chapter but
[46:04] we're going to be reading a couple of
[46:05] places and you will find that as now he
[46:08] is making his servant swear to ensure
[46:11] that he does exactly what Abraham wants
[46:14] him to do because Abraham has been in in
[46:18] relationship with his Lord you will see
[46:21] that the servant here is finding more
[46:24] more every time that AB Abraham's Lord
[46:28] is the faithful
[46:31] one so he is sending his servant and
[46:34] bringing him to to take an oath and then
[46:37] the
[46:38] servant
[46:40] Eleazar knowing that he was to make
[46:44] preparation to get the camels to get the
[46:46] jewels to get the bracelets to get
[46:49] everything ready the gold he knew that
[46:53] it would be easier easier to find a
[46:56] woman
[46:58] but his question was he was looking for
[47:01] the woman who would be willing to follow
[47:04] him not follow Abraham not follow Isaac
[47:08] but who would follow him elazar
[47:11] himself we remember that the prophet of
[47:14] God would said get the people to believe
[47:17] you it's always been like that so the
[47:20] the equation here was that elazar is
[47:24] coming let's read it at verse 5
[47:28] let started four but Thou shalt go unto
[47:31] my country and to my Kindred and take a
[47:34] wife unto my son Isaac now Abraham was
[47:37] living in one city where God asked him
[47:41] to go live in where the Canaanites were
[47:45] he couldn't find a wife there for his
[47:46] son so he had he knew that within here
[47:50] there's nothing there's no one who would
[47:52] uh who would
[47:53] be who would
[47:55] be carrying in the seed that has been
[47:58] promised through through me he's sending
[48:01] him to his brother's
[48:03] house five and the servant said unto him
[48:07] per Adventure the woman will not be
[48:10] willing to follow me me that's that's
[48:13] the key the key word there to follow me
[48:16] right so finding a woman was easy
[48:19] because he has too many camels and and
[48:20] and the gifts everybody would all the
[48:23] women would be
[48:24] attracted of the the gifts and the the
[48:27] camels but he knew that the the the the
[48:32] secret the mystery was finding one that
[48:38] would be
[48:39] willing to follow me as I
[48:44] am is I am to listen to whatever would
[48:48] tell her to to to be listening and
[48:53] hearing from myself amen and then we're
[48:57] moving in um let's move to verse
[49:01] 8 and if the woman will not be willing
[49:05] to follow thee that's Abraham talking
[49:08] then thou shall be clear from this my my
[49:11] oath only bring not my th uh thither
[49:15] thither again and the servant put his
[49:18] hand under the thigh of Abraham his
[49:20] master and swear to him concerning that
[49:24] matter 10 and the Serv vant took 10
[49:28] camels we know he's getting them uh 10
[49:31] camels of camels of of the camels of his
[49:34] master and departed for all the goods of
[49:37] his master were in his hand and he arose
[49:40] and went to Mesopotamia into the city of
[49:43] nahor and he made his camels to kneel
[49:46] down with without the City by a well of
[49:49] water at the time of the evening even
[49:52] the time that women go out to draw water
[49:56] the prophet of God says in the evening
[49:58] time that the woman the bride for Isaac
[50:01] was to be
[50:02] found now we he comes to verse 14 excuse
[50:06] me and uh with I it's going to be broken
[50:10] but God knows how was going to take it
[50:13] it it it comes that in the verse 14 we
[50:16] we see that the the servant himself will
[50:18] start praying amen cuz he knew that the
[50:23] task was a Divine task
[50:27] Abraham was following the leading of the
[50:30] Lord now Abraham my master had made me
[50:34] swear so this I I I must be in the line
[50:39] with all his Lord is commanding so he's
[50:42] praying in the 13 He said behold I stand
[50:46] Here by the whe of water in the
[50:49] daughters of the men of the City come
[50:52] out to draw water and let it and let it
[50:56] come to pass that the damsel this is his
[50:59] prayer his request the damsel to whom I
[51:01] shall say let down the picture I pray
[51:05] thee that I may
[51:06] drink and she shall
[51:09] say
[51:11] drink and I will give thy camel drink
[51:14] also we can we we can say it again that
[51:17] and she shall say
[51:20] drink and she shall say I will give thy
[51:24] camels drink also because the mystery
[51:29] was that the
[51:32] willingness was to come from the woman
[51:36] herself it was the woman herself who was
[51:39] to to
[51:41] reveal what she was willing to do for
[51:45] the camel for this man he he could have
[51:49] asked any woman at the the at the world
[51:51] that evening the woman would not prevent
[51:53] from giving him water they would give
[51:56] him to drink but the key was there was
[51:59] only one who would be able after she
[52:02] gives you water to drink she will also
[52:05] say I will also give water to the camels
[52:11] amen remember that the
[52:13] camels that's the word of God she was
[52:17] serving so the camels all the camels
[52:20] were not drinking the same amount of
[52:24] water they were not drinking the same
[52:26] amount of
[52:27] water some camels could have been
[52:30] probably harsh to to to give water to so
[52:34] she had to pass a
[52:37] test of every
[52:40] word she had to pass a test of every
[52:44] word so meaning that her by her own
[52:48] desire her own
[52:51] willingness she was to give water to
[52:55] each camel they were not drinking the
[52:57] same amount of water but we we'll go to
[53:00] move that quickly to listen to what the
[53:02] prophet of God is uh telling
[53:08] us this is in the message of time of
[53:11] decision
[53:12] so all of this hopefully God will help
[53:15] me to be able to present it as uh as I
[53:19] was uh looking at it
[53:22] so Rebecca after she met this
[53:27] man she had some Revelation from the
[53:31] father that this man is having is
[53:34] carrying something
[53:37] precious the camels were
[53:40] precious Rebecca didn't go to any other
[53:43] gifts that were there bracelet bra
[53:46] bracelets and and other Jewels they were
[53:49] there she could see them maybe on the
[53:50] camels but her her her first thought was
[53:55] these camels a revelation that if I can
[53:58] serve these
[54:03] camel let's read the prophet
[54:07] first in the time of decisions uh
[54:10] preached
[54:12] 1959 the prophet of God says you know we
[54:15] have been forced to make
[54:18] decisions there are times when we have
[54:21] to come to the place where we got to say
[54:26] yes yes or
[54:29] no that's just in human
[54:32] life there's a time where we cannot
[54:36] stand
[54:38] neutral so you will see that as elazar
[54:41] was visiting meeting this Rebecca this
[54:45] beautiful
[54:47] daughter as he he was going there he was
[54:52] searching hunting for a character that's
[54:56] right and this character was going to be
[54:59] reflected in the Free Will of the woman
[55:06] herself the testing was to see whether
[55:10] she is willing not being forced
[55:14] sometimes in the church you have to
[55:15] force somebody to to show him that you
[55:17] have to repent brother don't you see
[55:20] that you did this that you have to
[55:21] repent or a sister but a true Bride s
[55:26] something inside that when something is
[55:28] wrong they detect it by themselves by
[55:31] the free will they know how to detect it
[55:33] and the prophet of God says there's a
[55:35] time where we cannot stand
[55:38] neutral and if God shall permit I don't
[55:41] believe that we will be able to leave
[55:43] this church tonight in the same
[55:45] condition we did when we come into
[55:51] it he
[55:53] said we cannot remain the same
[55:57] and the time had to come for Abraham the
[55:59] great patriarch patriarch and servant of
[56:03] God to make a decision and this decision
[56:06] was that he was to decide just on who
[56:09] his son Isaac that he' waited 25 years
[56:13] for and had received him as one from the
[56:16] dead knew that he was called and
[56:19] separated
[56:20] messenger there was a time come when he
[56:23] had to make the decision so the prophet
[56:25] of God is staring with Abraham showing
[56:27] how Abraham had to make his decision
[56:29] first and then his servant has to make a
[56:32] decision to stay with what Abram said
[56:35] and then the last decision is coming to
[56:39] the woman who has been chosen to be a
[56:44] wife to Isaac and he said you see God
[56:48] Don't
[56:50] Make God don't make all of our
[56:53] decisions there's many times that God
[56:56] doesn't tell his Prophet just what to do
[56:58] talking about Abraham because they have
[57:00] to make the decision if there is a there
[57:03] is no decision that we have to
[57:06] make just wait every move on God then
[57:10] there is no overcoming on our
[57:14] part meaning
[57:16] that in life we've got to make decisions
[57:20] because if we don't make any decision
[57:22] the
[57:24] decision is going to be sh whether we
[57:27] overcome a
[57:29] situation or
[57:32] not the same time
[57:34] decision in in the same message time of
[57:37] decision he said then they said let her
[57:40] make her own decision that's where you
[57:43] stand tonight all of us we know that
[57:46] after we will go back to to 50 uh 2458
[57:56] when they called Rebecca and they called
[57:59] Rebecca and said unto her will thou go
[58:02] with this
[58:04] man and she said I will go this is after
[58:09] she had already passed the test of
[58:11] giving water to the camels now they came
[58:15] there came a last
[58:17] decision that they have to ask
[58:20] her if she was willing to go because her
[58:25] family wanted her her to stay for 10
[58:26] more
[58:27] days but be something happened within
[58:30] her that she knew that she had passed
[58:33] all the test that there was nothing else
[58:36] to wait for once this bride has passed
[58:39] the test that she has fulfilled every
[58:42] scripture there's not even one second
[58:45] she will be delayed for the
[58:47] Rapture she will not
[58:50] wait he said that's where you stand
[58:52] tonight make your own decision then they
[58:55] call called Rebecca and said will you go
[58:57] with this man or do you want to stay
[59:00] around a little while to see whether you
[59:03] really want to do it she said I will go
[59:07] she was ready amen her decision was
[59:10] quickly made she knew there's something
[59:14] been leading her so she was led by
[59:19] something that the time she went to give
[59:23] water is the prophet of God said that
[59:25] when the angel the the servant elasa was
[59:28] praying the Angel Beat him 30 minutes
[59:31] ahead and to bring Rebecca on the
[59:34] way as she came there something
[59:38] Supernatural from God inspired her to do
[59:42] what she was doing and to respond
[59:44] exactly the way she responded according
[59:47] to the prayer of the servants she said I
[59:49] will go she was ready her decision was
[59:52] quickly made she knew there's something
[59:56] been leading her she knew something had
[59:59] happened to her and she knew that it was
[1:00:02] God and she was
[1:00:05] satisfied so her decision her
[1:00:09] willingness it was not something forced
[1:00:11] by anybody it was through the Revelation
[1:00:15] from God and within that decision she
[1:00:19] was
[1:00:21] satisfied she wanted to go quickly oh
[1:00:24] God if the church could only make that
[1:00:27] decision right quick I know some of us
[1:00:31] here maybe or all of us here we've got
[1:00:33] some decisions to make in life as we're
[1:00:36] sitting here in our family maybe some
[1:00:40] family fuse that we have to put things
[1:00:42] in order or some decisions whatever God
[1:00:45] is calling us to do God said that
[1:00:47] there's the prophet of God says that if
[1:00:50] the church could only make that decision
[1:00:53] quick and the only way we can make that
[1:00:56] decision is if we're willing to
[1:00:59] surrender all to God
[1:01:03] Amen what a clear-cut
[1:01:07] decision in the message that their eyes
[1:01:09] were
[1:01:11] opened some of them are not in order but
[1:01:14] who can go Rebecca didn't know what
[1:01:16] Isaac looked like but it was love anyhow
[1:01:20] see she didn't know what he looked like
[1:01:23] she just had to go the type she SE him
[1:01:26] and loved him she was willing to go
[1:01:29] anyhow no matter what he looked
[1:01:32] like in the same message he said Rebecca
[1:01:35] which was to be the wife of this
[1:01:38] noted noted promised uh wed son when she
[1:01:42] was called on the final test so when
[1:01:47] they were asking her or you're ready to
[1:01:49] go or you willing to go this was a final
[1:01:53] test to see if she would be that woman
[1:01:58] that wife that would be uh going
[1:02:00] following the messenger to her husband
[1:02:07] Isaac let me read it again and Rebecca
[1:02:10] which was to be the wife of a this noted
[1:02:12] promised waited son when she was called
[1:02:15] to the final test or of a strange man
[1:02:19] that she never seen before only she seen
[1:02:23] the working of the Holy Spirit and when
[1:02:26] her parents could not fully decide
[1:02:28] whether she should go with this stranger
[1:02:31] or not to be uh the wife of a man that
[1:02:34] she had never seen she was brought to
[1:02:37] the final
[1:02:39] test well will get the damsel and let
[1:02:43] her
[1:02:44] speak will hear from her mouth whether
[1:02:47] she will go she will she will go yes or
[1:02:50] no that's the way it's brought to all
[1:02:54] the seed of God amen so all the seed of
[1:02:57] God will come to this final test in our
[1:03:00] life whether we will follow this word
[1:03:04] the messenger that's right to take us to
[1:03:08] Christ whether we will follow every word
[1:03:10] that this messenger has brought to
[1:03:13] us it's got to be the prophet of God
[1:03:16] says it's got to be your mouth declaring
[1:03:21] it not in private it's got to be your
[1:03:25] mouth declar Dearing that I believe this
[1:03:27] message I believe this messenger he was
[1:03:31] sent for me and you will be doing it
[1:03:36] willingly it's got to be your mouth God
[1:03:40] wants to hear from
[1:03:43] you God wants to hear from you when you
[1:03:47] declaring it willingly Lord I am willing
[1:03:52] to follow the messenger this message
[1:03:54] amen
[1:03:56] so when she was put to the test she
[1:03:59] never hesitated a a minute she said I
[1:04:02] will go she was fully
[1:04:05] persued that's the people that God can
[1:04:10] use the people that God can use those
[1:04:13] are are fully persuaded that this
[1:04:15] message is the truth and I know it's
[1:04:17] taking me to my husband
[1:04:24] Christ and the prophet of God says why
[1:04:27] she the the Abraham had to only find
[1:04:32] somebody from his K his Kindred because
[1:04:37] they were blood relative that's right
[1:04:40] and the prophet of God is going to be
[1:04:42] interpreting that for us he said and
[1:04:44] look quickly as soon as she heard about
[1:04:46] Isaac before she had ever saw him she
[1:04:49] said I will
[1:04:50] go why she was a blood relative to him
[1:04:54] see thou was Abraham's brother child
[1:04:59] Isaac and Rebecca were first cousins
[1:05:01] blood relation showing that the church
[1:05:04] in the last days will be blood relation
[1:05:07] to
[1:05:08] Christ for the very God that
[1:05:11] predestinated Christ was the lamb slain
[1:05:14] before the foundation of the
[1:05:20] world the church itself its name was put
[1:05:23] on the book before the foundation of the
[1:05:25] world world and Rebecca as soon as she
[1:05:27] heard of Isaac there was something in
[1:05:30] her that pulled her straight to him
[1:05:32] though she hadn't SE him or nothing she
[1:05:36] wanted to go by her own
[1:05:42] choice probably will make it clear so
[1:05:46] there's always a choice a testing for
[1:05:49] every seed the prophet of God says it
[1:05:52] started there with Abraham Abraham
[1:05:54] himself he was
[1:05:57] tested he was willing to follow the word
[1:06:00] of God to the end that's the reason he
[1:06:04] could even call his his servants Eleazar
[1:06:07] that what you are about to do for my son
[1:06:10] to go find a wife for him you have to do
[1:06:13] it according to what I believe I believe
[1:06:17] in God Jacob was also tested and the
[1:06:21] prophet of God says in hearing receiving
[1:06:23] and acting
[1:06:25] now we find that the birthright meant
[1:06:28] everything to Jacob we're going to see
[1:06:30] how the seed
[1:06:33] line is always
[1:06:37] willing and when you are committing
[1:06:40] yourself to be willing to do
[1:06:45] something there is always a a reproach
[1:06:48] for you because you're taking up a
[1:06:51] responsibility once you said I am
[1:06:54] willing in whatever you want to be
[1:06:57] willing to do it's a responsibility you
[1:07:00] are taking upon yourself so the word is
[1:07:03] so simple I
[1:07:05] will but it's heavy in the Declaration
[1:07:08] it has something Concrete in it he said
[1:07:13] now he didn't care for nothing this is
[1:07:15] Jacob for nothing else but that
[1:07:18] Birthright he didn't care what it cost
[1:07:21] him if it was a mess of page he was glad
[1:07:24] to give it to
[1:07:26] Esau so it is so is it with any man or
[1:07:30] woman that has been ordained to eternal
[1:07:33] life that God has called to eternal life
[1:07:37] is willing to sell out anything of the
[1:07:40] world to obtain that birth right so
[1:07:43] Jacob Jacob showed that also he was
[1:07:47] willing to do anything to get that birth
[1:07:51] right Moses
[1:07:53] also brother brother says that Moses
[1:07:57] when he was in
[1:07:58] Egypt uh taught by his
[1:08:01] mother when he tried to kill one
[1:08:03] Egyptian he ran away he said be because
[1:08:07] Moses has not come fully to give himself
[1:08:11] willingly to God but when he met the
[1:08:14] pillar fire in the burning bush the
[1:08:16] prophet of God says that therefore Moses
[1:08:19] Drew up with a willing heart to
[1:08:22] understand and God spoke to Moses and
[1:08:25] said said take off your shoes for the
[1:08:27] ground that you stand on is is Holy
[1:08:30] Ground Moses removes his shoes and God
[1:08:34] talked to Moses Moses learned more 5
[1:08:38] minutes in the presence of that fire
[1:08:40] than he than he had learned in 40 years
[1:08:43] of education and the prophet of God says
[1:08:46] that then we find after that that Moses
[1:08:51] after meeting the pillar of Fire
[1:08:55] Moses then was
[1:08:59] willing Moses took a decision and when
[1:09:02] we come to a point that we are
[1:09:05] willing God can do something with us God
[1:09:09] can use
[1:09:11] us so God wanted to show us that the
[1:09:15] bride the true bride of his son Isaac
[1:09:18] the true bride of his son the Lord Jesus
[1:09:21] Christ is going to be committed in
[1:09:24] commission once she gets to a point that
[1:09:27] she is willing to give it all
[1:09:31] amen we know that uh the lamb the
[1:09:35] prophet of God says now the lamb is a
[1:09:37] very gent uh gentle little fellow is is
[1:09:40] speaking about David
[1:09:43] first he said why did he choose David in
[1:09:47] the message
[1:09:49] Shepherd David was always talking about
[1:09:52] uh Still Waters and Green Pastures he
[1:09:55] was the psalmist that wrote songs and
[1:09:57] played on his harp to the glory of God
[1:10:01] and he must have been something he must
[1:10:03] have been something about David tending
[1:10:05] sheep he must have been a real sheep
[1:10:08] Herer did you notice one time there was
[1:10:11] a bear run and got one of his sheep and
[1:10:14] he killed that bear and a lion run in
[1:10:17] and got one of and he caught that be uh
[1:10:21] lion by the beard and took a knife and
[1:10:24] killed that lion see it was
[1:10:28] sacrificing for his
[1:10:31] sheep
[1:10:33] willing is also a synonym of
[1:10:38] sacrifice we will see that later on if
[1:10:40] we have a few more minutes and if he was
[1:10:43] willing to lay down his life for the
[1:10:46] Sheep he was willing by him willing to
[1:10:49] lay down his sheep he was sacrificing
[1:10:52] for the Sheep he was atire of the Good
[1:10:56] Shepherd he was the son of David you
[1:10:58] know the real Shepherd the king shepherd
[1:11:01] and the prophet of God speaks about a
[1:11:04] little uh a little sheep that was lost
[1:11:07] somewhere and then he went to pick up
[1:11:10] that
[1:11:11] sheep I can read it somewhere here he
[1:11:16] said and I come by and sin way up about
[1:11:19] a half a mile was a whole herd of sheep
[1:11:23] now he he had laid right there and the
[1:11:27] the crows would have been picking his
[1:11:29] eyes pretty soon so there was a ship
[1:11:31] lost there separated from the from the
[1:11:34] the herd and the prophet of God
[1:11:36] approached the the the the little fellow
[1:11:38] he picked him up in the arm he never
[1:11:41] refused he laid real really quiet I
[1:11:45] picked him up in my arm first time
[1:11:48] perhaps a human being had ever had their
[1:11:51] hands on him but he was gentle he was
[1:11:55] willing to be led that's the nature of a
[1:11:58] sheep and the prophet of God say
[1:12:01] comparing our nature to be the nature of
[1:12:03] a sheep he was willing to be led he was
[1:12:08] willing to be helped a Christian should
[1:12:11] be led I hope you see he was willing not
[1:12:15] to try to resist or to kick back or to
[1:12:19] bite Lambs don't kick back they don't
[1:12:22] bite they just humble themselves
[1:12:26] we see the same thing when Solomon when
[1:12:28] David was about to to pass away David
[1:12:33] calling all his uh the people in his uh
[1:12:35] in in Palace calling his all his sons
[1:12:39] he's speaking to to
[1:12:41] Solomon but God is as Solomon is going
[1:12:43] to be praying now for God to give him
[1:12:45] wisdom so he can carry on the the plans
[1:12:49] of his father David it's going to be in
[1:12:52] the book of Chronicle we'll see that God
[1:12:54] is to Chronicles I can read it to 2
[1:12:57] Chronicles 7 uh 17 154 for now I have
[1:13:02] chosen a Sanctified this house that my
[1:13:06] name that's God speaking that my name be
[1:13:09] there forever and my eyes and my heart
[1:13:12] shall be there
[1:13:15] perpetually but God is going to
[1:13:17] give to Solomon the key for him to
[1:13:22] succeed for him to inherit All His
[1:13:24] blessings said and as for thee if thou
[1:13:29] will walk before me meaning that if you
[1:13:33] are willing
[1:13:35] yourself not somebody forcing me not me
[1:13:38] telling you if you are willing to walk
[1:13:41] before me as David thy father walked and
[1:13:45] do according to all that I have
[1:13:47] commanded thee and shall observe my
[1:13:50] statutes and my judgment then will I
[1:13:54] established the Throne of thy
[1:13:58] kingdom we see the same pattern with
[1:14:01] Ruth a couple more minutes or just
[1:14:04] building
[1:14:06] up we see
[1:14:08] Naomi headed back to the Homeland after
[1:14:12] losing her husband and her sons with a
[1:14:15] two daughters uh daughter in-laws orpa
[1:14:19] is staying behind she wanted to come but
[1:14:22] she stopped but Ruth was
[1:14:26] willing by her own self her own desire
[1:14:31] to go all the way amen and because God
[1:14:34] saw that she was willing reserved her a
[1:14:38] great blessing before her the prophet of
[1:14:40] God says that Ruth was willing to
[1:14:43] forsake her
[1:14:45] Idols
[1:14:47] willingness to forsake her past
[1:14:50] life willing to forsake her people
[1:14:54] willing to forsake everything and return
[1:14:57] with Naomi no matter what the
[1:15:00] circumstances was she was willing to go
[1:15:04] that's the way every man that comes to
[1:15:07] Christ must first be willing
[1:15:16] regardless in uh letting off the
[1:15:19] pressure the prophet of God says that if
[1:15:23] somebody is being haunted maybe he
[1:15:26] committed maybe a crime somewhere he
[1:15:28] didn't intend to he wants to be in in
[1:15:31] the House of
[1:15:32] Refuge first has to be
[1:15:36] willing to go in and even after he comes
[1:15:41] in they let him in he has to be willing
[1:15:45] to remain there because if he's not
[1:15:47] willing to remain there they're going to
[1:15:49] catch him one
[1:15:52] day the only time that
[1:15:57] we're not
[1:15:59] willing from our free will God sees this
[1:16:03] as a
[1:16:04] refusal right in the book of Isaiah it
[1:16:08] says God told Isaiah 1:18 420 he said
[1:16:12] come now and let us Rasen together
[1:16:14] sayith the Lord though your sins be as
[1:16:18] scth they shall be as white as snow
[1:16:21] though they be red like Crimson they
[1:16:24] shall be as War if ye be
[1:16:28] willing and
[1:16:31] obedient you shall eat the good of the
[1:16:34] land now the opposite of not be
[1:16:38] willing from God it's a refusal he said
[1:16:43] but if you refuse meaning if you are not
[1:16:46] willing anytime we are not willing to
[1:16:49] serve God we're not from our own will to
[1:16:55] serve in reality we are refusing
[1:17:00] right anytime we are not obedient in
[1:17:04] reality we are Rebels yeah right he said
[1:17:09] if you be willing in obedient you shall
[1:17:12] eat the good of the land but if you
[1:17:16] refuse meaning if you you are not
[1:17:20] willing
[1:17:22] amen and re and
[1:17:26] you shall be devoured with the sword for
[1:17:29] the mouth of the Lord has spoken only
[1:17:33] Pharaoh was the one who was not willing
[1:17:36] you will see that every time God will
[1:17:38] send Moses to get his people out Pharaoh
[1:17:42] was not
[1:17:43] willing and God hardened his heart for
[1:17:46] that because he knew that he would not
[1:17:48] letting them go so I'm just skipping
[1:17:51] here so the prophet of God says that few
[1:17:55] more minutes maybe 3
[1:17:56] minutes he's showing us himself how
[1:17:59] Jesus Christ who is God
[1:18:03] himself to save you and
[1:18:06] me he had to be willing to do that he
[1:18:10] said he was not obligated no one forced
[1:18:13] him he was not obligated to do that it
[1:18:16] was of his own free will that he would
[1:18:20] come and give his life for you and me
[1:18:24] and the prophet of God says that he
[1:18:25] humbled
[1:18:28] himself and that's what makes him great
[1:18:31] to
[1:18:32] me that's what makes him real to me is
[1:18:36] to think that he was willing to come
[1:18:40] down here and not be some great somebody
[1:18:45] take some great name or something like
[1:18:47] that he made himself humble and be be
[1:18:50] became a servant to all of them thus my
[1:18:54] Lord Jesus that's the one I love that's
[1:18:57] the one I want to give my life
[1:19:00] entirely to serve him the prophet is
[1:19:04] willing seeing that the Lord has given
[1:19:07] himself
[1:19:08] willingly so that should trigger
[1:19:10] something in every every seed of God
[1:19:14] that we should be willing to render him
[1:19:16] a
[1:19:20] service even when he was invited to
[1:19:23] Simon knew what he was what was going to
[1:19:26] happen there he was still willing to go
[1:19:30] there he was in where wherever he was
[1:19:33] invited he would show up willing to go
[1:19:37] there even one day there was a leper in
[1:19:40] the Book of Matthew Who Came To Worship
[1:19:43] Him and say
[1:19:44] Lord if thou will thou can make me clean
[1:19:49] he was willing because that was a
[1:19:52] scripture he said and Jesus put forth
[1:19:55] his hand and touch him and say I will
[1:19:59] I'm always willing to help in this
[1:20:02] evening he's here willing to do anything
[1:20:08] for you and me amen and the only thing
[1:20:10] we can do as we stand the time it's
[1:20:14] broken up it's
[1:20:21] u in in the the Hebrew chapter the
[1:20:25] prophet of God
[1:20:26] says he didn't have
[1:20:29] to talking about Jesus but he was
[1:20:33] willing to I'm so glad that so glad of
[1:20:37] that unto you that our God is willing
[1:20:41] look what if what if he wasn't
[1:20:45] longsuffering what if what is the fruit
[1:20:48] of the spirit love joy uh Faith peace
[1:20:51] longsuffering that's a part of God that
[1:20:55] is in
[1:20:56] you willingness is
[1:21:01] longsuffering and the prophet of God
[1:21:03] says that this is a part of God that is
[1:21:06] within you it's only in Believers the
[1:21:09] willingness prise
[1:21:11] God he said and can forbearance
[1:21:14] forbearing one another's burden
[1:21:16] forgiving one another is God for
[1:21:19] Christ's sake forgive you the spirit of
[1:21:23] God in you make makes you that way and
[1:21:27] then when God was here on Earth and
[1:21:29] became you became sin that him taking
[1:21:34] your sin bore it for you and paid your
[1:21:36] penalty for it God is
[1:21:40] longsuffering for bearing our
[1:21:44] burden something to share but for the
[1:21:46] time I know that the prophet of God says
[1:21:48] that speaks about uh uh his friend who
[1:21:52] was a Deadshot who had a little whistle
[1:21:56] to bring up uh a baby uh door he said
[1:22:01] that what when that mother deer who
[1:22:03] heard a sound of a a baby in trouble
[1:22:06] when she showed
[1:22:08] up she was facing the open of uh opening
[1:22:11] of that that gun she was not afraid the
[1:22:15] prophet of God says because her baby she
[1:22:19] thought that her baby was in danger and
[1:22:22] she was willing to put put her life on
[1:22:25] the
[1:22:26] line and that was the nature of God the
[1:22:30] nature of the children of God they are
[1:22:32] willing with their own free will to
[1:22:36] serve their
