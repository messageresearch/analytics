welcome and we appreciate you coming and joining us and we're very thankful to god that he brought brother abraham back to us you know coveted separated quite a bit of fellowship around the world but we're thankful those borders have opened and just just i think just a little over two weeks ago our brother received a visa so he could come so at the last minute he got the visa and got and paved the way and all the doors opened and he made it safely here so we're thankful for that remember abraham has been a good friend to the assembly and over the last few years he's become a very good friend of mine and of many here and i really appreciate her brother we know we have a pulling power here because he's got family here he's got sister mercy and brother moses and you know his grandchildren are here so we thank god for that god was good to us amen and gave us a little pulling power so we're we're thankful for him to be back and i just want to say i really appreciate the gift of god that he put in our brother and our brother's willingness to yield himself to that gift and and i don't know about you but i've come tonight expecting you know brother branham said we get what we come looking for amen and we get what we expect and so if you have an expectation then god is here to meet that expectation and i just want to remind you that the service will be tomorrow night at 5 pm then again sunday morning at the usual service time at 10 30. also there'll be the men's fellowship breakfast at 9 30 at brother donovan fisher's home he and sister stephanie are hosting that so if you're here if you're a visitor if you'd like to join us you're more than welcome just see one of the brothers after church and they'll direct you the right way so you can get to that also there'll be a youth gathering and fellowship at the bible believer's school gym tomorrow from 11am to 2pm the bcf youth will be providing the lunch and all you 13 and up are welcome so you're more than welcome to be there for that as well tomorrow at the bible believer school gym from 11am to 2pm amen if you're a visitor and you'd like to be there just grab somebody after church and ask where it's at and if you don't know how to get there and we'll make sure that you get there amen i think we're looking forward to a good time in the word good time of fellowship with one another and i just i thank god that he's always faithful to his word he said wherever two or three are gather in my name i'll be in their midst amen and god is always faithful to his word i mean he also chose the foolishness of preaching and we believe that that that's god's method so if we come according to the word and we expect according to the word then god will meet us according to his word amen what is the attraction what is the attraction in this world in this day what is the attraction of this age the beauty of christ and the revelation of the word revealed in his people amen that's what we gather around god bless you brother dennis good to see you i'm glad you came down the long journey from far north michigan god bless you brother it's good to have you here amen let's just focus now on the lord and pull on the gift and receive our portion amen brother john [Music] holy spirit thou art will come in this place [Music] thou art will come in this place [Music] father of mercy and grace [Music] [Applause] i hope i'm doing fine i greet you all saints in the name of lord jesus christ and maybe you may be seated for a moment yeah quite some time isn't it and um i'm thankful to the lord that he has kept you alive and not only alive physically but still loving him and serving him that is really special so i want to bring greetings from uganda from my family and church home church in particular and before i came here also i was in kenya some friends from nairobi and another place called naroq they emphasized and emphasized that i should bring their greetings to this fellowship so they love you so much and you don't know that there are so many people around the world who pray for you and of course um they appreciate the minister brother chad and you who are standing here i also appreciate you because friendship is only tasty when there is a friend so i mean you cannot talk about friendship when there is no friend and it makes a meaning that there is a brother there is a sister somewhere who loves you you love him and you value one another you try treasure one another that makes friendship you know something you can look to so as the brothers said it's been quite a while and um we kept praying for one another but you know things were more tougher here than i think the way in our place so but i thank god that you were all preserved in the world by the blood and we have come to meet one another well still waiting to go home one of these days so so far so good and um i've been once in a while you know listening to some of the summons preached here i have wonderful preachers here i can't see the other brother there i forget his name but i yeah straight across there and brother si bolt and brother kyle and pastor chad and all see you have been a blessing to many around the world so definitely we are not very far from going home because of what has happened this you know what we see around the world and we want to thank god that we see it from a different view than the whole world sees so the world is on their tenterhooks they are shaken they are trembling for us we are on sure ground we are actually happy and you should be happy that you are seeing these things because not everybody had a chance to see them yeah jesus one time told the disciples says when you shall see jerusalem surrounded by the enemies then it's time to flee to the mountains but how could they flee if they were surrounded within so at first they were surrounded within but that was a sign and then for no reason no known reason titus the roman general withdrew and went back so that it was it became a sign for these people to get out and then he came back again so this this coffee 19 and all these you know blockades here and there i think is a sign that something is coming and we have to be somewhere hidden away in christ jesus amen so i don't want to i don't have actually much to say but just to say that i love you and i i want to appreciate you that you permitted together with sister angie your pastor to visit us in uganda we had a wonderful time with him it was a blessing to us as a family a blessing to the church and the young robot of christ in uganda people are still talking about how they were blessed and and the impact of the meetings still resonating around so we appreciate you so much that was just recently i think in the month of december yeah i think the same or something so when he was in our place so we appreciate you so much and then i've also come to officially say i'm i'm inviting him that is just the kind way to invite him by standing here and then he comes over and i know you are good enough to permit him to come again amen so brother chad has been a special friend and i i want to say that i've been really blessed by his ministry and on wednesday when he was preaching here i said wow he has finished everything that was supposed to preach come on boy continue [Music] but it is very hard again to persuade him to con continue so i'm just praying that god helps me somehow to channel back into that and then say something so maybe let's stand up and have a word of prayer loving heavenly father once again after some time i'm here before your children we know we have been together in the spirit by your anointing and lord your hand has been upon us and kept us we cannot be thankful enough but especially to come here and find your children still serving you rejoicing at your world waiting for that grand hour lord when our bodies shall be changed i pray that god you know my weaknesses my limitations my tiredness over all this period of time laboring in the field you just pray that god you come and touch this body and law that you just help me to get out of the way and that you'll be the one to come and become a blessing to your children like you've always done and bless them lord god and bless us together lord as you lord unveil yourself through the breaking of the word anoint me and lord speak through these lips of clay that which you ordained to edify to strengthen and encourage your children we thank you because we know you have always been there for us in jesus name we pray amen um i just wanted us to turn to our bibles and i wanted us to start with the book of matthew chapter 21. matthew chapter 21 from verse 23 i think i'll read up to verse 27 and when he came into the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came out of him as he was teaching and he said by what authority do we style these things and who gave thee this authority and jesus answered and said unto them i also will ask you one thing which if you tell me i in likewise will tell you by what authority i do these things so in other words the question the answer to the question was in the question that it was going to give them the baptism of john whence was it from heaven or of man and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say unto us why did he did he not believe him but if we shall say of men we fear the people for all hold him as a prophet now i want you to mark that statement they hold him as a prophet and they answered jesus and said we cannot tell and he said unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things so there was a statement and if you'll see in this chapter in verse 12 he speaks again about john the baptist he says for john came unto you in the way of righteousness and you believed him not but the publicans and the hallows believed him and he when you had seen it repented the note afterwards that you might be that you might believe him why he brings it again and then at the end of this chapter there is something again strange in verse 45 and when the chief priests and pharisees had had he had this parable they perceived that he speak of them but when they sought to lay hands on him they feared a multitude why because they took him for a prophet so the maori took jesus for a prophet and they also held john for a prophet may god bless his word and bless you may be seated i wanted us as we see it to go back to matthew chapter 11 and see why jesus points this book back to john the baptist because in matthew 11 from verse 2 now when john had had in the prison the works of christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto them i mean say it unto him and thou he that should come or do we look for another now this is the man who introduced him but we are trying to follow a thought that i want us to follow like a trail through these meetings why did such things happen they were not a mistake they were right in goddess per person plan john who introduced jesus is sending the disciples to inquire whether he's the messiah or they should look for another and jesus doesn't go on a condemning spree castigating and belittling john the baptist no but he points to the resultant effect or product of what john introduced and jesus that's verse 4 answer and said unto them go and show john again the things which you do hear and see the blind receive their sight the lamb walk the lepers are cleansed the death here the dead are raised up the poor have the gospel preached to them and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me and as they departed jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning john what he went out into the wilderness to see a reed shaken with the wind but what went he out for to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold either way a softer clothing and the king's houses but wait what went he out for to see a prophet yeah and i say unto you and more than a prophet for this is of whom it is written behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee verily sent you among them that are born of women there has not risen a greater than john the baptist of all born of women in other words with only the exception of himself the speaker jesus christ and adam the rest john the baptist was greater than them but i want us to look at how could you compare the ministry of john the baptist with the minister of moses if it was in comparison terms of the supernatural the anointing the prophecies the miracles the signs and wonders the demonstration of power how could john stand a chance to be compared with moses how could he even be compared with the right i mean isaiah we've even done here all those prophets if you've got to look at the supernatural the miraculous the signs they were all above john but why is jesus saying of all that is born that are born of women no one is greater than john the baptist and john the baptist was so scared down in the spiritual and prophecies tell me 10 prophecies five of them which jolly baptist prophesied he was a prophet yes but what did he prophesy what did he tell us about the future and today we believe him to be a prophet and the bible says he's a prophet and jesus says he's more than a prophet and of all that we're born of women no one can come near to john the baptist so there is a mystery there that if god gives me the grace we could look at so when you begin to look at this what is jesus trying to draw the people to he says he's more than a prophet and of all other born of women there's not reason a greater than john the baptist not with his turning that is however the least he that is the least or least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than john he so the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than john because those who are born in the kingdom of heaven are not born of women they are born of the incorruptible seed and john never became a christian he pointed the people to christ but he never became a christian and that's why a christian the least in the kingdom of christianity the kingdom of christ becomes greater than john because he remained within the confines of the or the dispensation of servant prophets but we are now in the dispensation of sons and daughters of god [Music] so john when he had a chance to be baptized he never went on to be baptized he only told jesus i have need of you to baptize me how do you come to me and jesus says fine i understand you you understand me let me baptize you i mean you baptize me suffer it to be so but after him baptizing jesus he never went also to tell jesus to baptize him so because he was not baptized he remained in the old testament dispensation so he remained a sovereign prophet not a sign a prophet that's why they list the kingdom of heaven in the kingdom of christ in the new dispensation of the new covenant which is the new testament he becomes the least but in the old testament all the dispensation those born of women those upon whom the holy spirit came upon not into no one was greater than john now i'm talking about receiving the mysterious reality of them more than a prophet ministry more than a prophet what was that more than a prophet blessed be the name of the lord jesus is saying you went to see whom do we do you go did you go to look for what did you go to see what did you go to receive and of course john the baptist parallels today as john the baptist was sent to foreign the first coming of jesus so shall your message for around the second coming so the question is what did you got to see what did he go in the wilderness to receive the sword of the king so what did you go to receive from him and until you know what you came to the message for you have missed it and that's why there is where people are hitting a snag they are no longer able to see where they are going they are in a spiritual focus they can't understand they have lost identity because they came to believe something they came to believe the message they came to hear a prophet they came to believe malachi 4 but what they receive what did you go out for to receive what is that that you have said you are a believer you believe what what have you received what have you believed and that's why when they are questioning the authority of jesus the question about the source of the authority of jesus jesus puts them back to the one we introduced to him if you know what his message was if you knew if you had received that message if you knew why you went to the wilderness if you had received the reality of why you went to the wilderness what you were supposed to go and receive you will not be asking me with that question so the answer to your question is in the reason why you went into the wilderness but you well do a wilderness you when you put the effort you wanted there but you missed it so go back to your drawing boards and begin to find out why you went to the wilderness then you know why i have this authority so the authority that i have today begins from there when you receive the reality of your there is prophet what his real message is you get to know this but if you missed that you will not understand this blessed be the name of the lord and you see the reason many are hitting the snag and i wouldn't want you to reach that spot because very dangerous it's very important for you to know what you have received i mean it's good to come here to be a good believer to pay tithes and offerings to be a deacon to be a trustee to be a good preacher but you have seen that men have been good preachers and they have failed you can be a very good preacher you can be very anointed you can be very spiritual even even in the spirit and you have missed it because even judas missed it yet he was with the reality but he never got the revelation of what this man was who he was because brother abraham says what makes john the baptist stands out is because he was the messenger of the new covenant god was starting something and that was the alpha now we are in the omega the completion of that new covenant when all the loose ends are tied and the fullness of the word is brought and then you are introduced to him [Music] so the hymn christ is the step beyond the prophet so the message that you are supposed to receive is more than is beyond the prophet so you are not supposed just to hold him as a prophet the sanhedrin knew that the mountains held the journey as a prophet they even held jesus took jesus for a prophet they accepted him as a prophet until the the first season jesus christ feared to arrest jesus because they knew their mouth could stone them because the multitude believed that jesus was a prophet and they were even scared to say that the ministry of john the baptist was of them of men because they knew men could even he said easily stoning them men held john as a prophet but they ended with john as a prophet but john had a ministry a mysterious reality beyond the office of a prophet he was more than a prophet he brought a message and the message was greater than him and he was supposed to become a thing immediately he introduces the reality and that's why he could even begin to doubt what he spoke the other day and jesus didn't even think about it it didn't even matter to him he couldn't even talk about it and you look at this man he has vaccinated john had already finished his work he had already done his part and whether he was doubting or not it was not having his business as far as god was concerned his work was already done so you begin to look about his mistakes his failures his unbelief what he's saying at this time about the ministry that was no problem in other words there was an allowance for john to begin to express doubt over what he introduced an allowance and heaven never recognized that heaven recognized one thing john had already identified introduced their reality and showed them to the world here is the man and that's why you find those who hold the messenger of the day as a prophet they hold him as a prophet they put him in a prophetic office and they begin to examine him look he said this he said that he said this he said that why they hold him as a prophet they end on the prophetic office they are looking at the prophet but brother branham is more than a prophet [Applause] his ministry went beyond the prophetic office and every prophet there is another one for so many errors to blinding those who want to scientifically and critically look at the ministry [Music] lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their hearts and that they should repent and i see the heart heal them why why did god you know i talked with brother chad one time we have not sold that question up to now moses was married to zipporah the median artist when did he marry the ethiopian human wasn't miriam right to complain wasn't medium legally right morally right when did the mothers married this ethiopian human who told him to does the bible say anything about it but miriam when he saw the mistake when she saw the mistake together with her brother aaron and they spoke about it god was silent so we don't know god is deal between moses between him and moses about the issue of marrying the ethiopian woman we don't know we don't know whether zipper had died or not the bible doesn't mention but he married an ethiopian woman this was the medianity human and miriam is complaining and aaron is complaining so biblically scripturally according to the law they are right this is an error and this is a prophet and this is an office and if he makes an error we have a right to point it out no right to point out god came down and said can't you fear god why was god protecting the error of moses can't we go back and look at that carefully why would god defend abraham for telling a lie and he makes a bemidji to pay a fine for taking the away the prophet his wife why would god do that there was a confidence between the two he had a message and the abraham's message was to sarah the church and and make no mistake about that he has a lot of errors and he kept telling lies but god never looked at them and he's like he had immunity blessed is the man unto whom the lord does not impute so how does that scripture work unless that man is given the opportunity to do something wrong and who are you today question god why the other one is giving him you know that privilege which i'm not children i don't know i don't know god is deal my work was to receive the message not to examine the messenger remember my robins you remember the ravens you are not supposed to ask who whether they have sterilized they are big so not they are just commanded to bring you food just receive the food and eat no question where are you getting them sandwiches from did you sterilize your beaks i have commanded the reverence to feed you so they'll be bringing you food why didn't you send a dove god why did you decide to sin to send an cleaning bird don't ask me questions you needed a food are we going to tell god he was wrong to send this one he was supposed to send who what did he go to the wilderness look for mr perfect he no he was not mr perfect he was to introduce mr perfect but he was not mr perfect so don't begin to look at the introducer to be mr perfect he introduced mr perfect to you look the one he introduced to you so we are in a dangerous age where people are pointing you to the messenger they hold him are holding on him they are making him accountable to that office we shall begin to say maybe tomorrow who who is the culprit and who is the victim are you the believer who is the victim of the preacher or the preacher is also the victim you can say oh okay pastor chad you preached the word i mean i believed okay but i also didn't call myself to preach i was also saying what to preach the gospel so who is wrong who has a case i was warned to me if i don't preach the word the gospel and want you if you don't believe there gospel so if i preach it hard and it hurts you and say well that pastor has a problem okay i wouldn't have had a problem with you if i was not sent so are we going to turn and blame god no how can we how dare we so here we are do we blame the the vessel he said oh he blamed the sender and why did the center continue using the scent and he knows the scent has got a lot of problems [Music] well according to god's big plan he's not interested so much in the weaknesses of the scent but he's interested in the purpose of the scent the message that he gave gave the messenger so there is a more than a prophet reality in other words when john questions jesus doesn't condemn jesus doesn't even speak anything negative he only magnifies what that office has done says i am the reality if you are doubting go and tell john what you see and what you hear john introduced this many have ended all john that's why even herod and his wife killed john because they held john responsible for what he preached now i'm not going to hold brother brandon i'm responsible for what he preached although he said i am responsible as long as he was god his voice he's not responsible for the message he was a pipe he was a vessel he was a channel that god used neither am i going to question the message based on the weakness of the messenger that's not my business that's god's business my business is to receive the reality going beyond the office of a prophet why let's look at this critically those who held who took jesus for a prophet electron denied him and condemned him and said crucify him do you know that even herod who killed john the baptist the bible says he had him gradually and and didn't want even to harm him but just to please his wife had put him in prison until a convenient they came but herod was not intending to kill john he took him for a prophet he believed john was a prophet but the one who believed john to be a prophet kill the jew when circumstances came when a convenient day came amen a day of convenience when another voice rises up to be vindictive to pin him he must die that voice must be dealt with he killed him so whoever ended with holding john only as a prophet that didn't benefit him the multitudes took him for a prophet the mountains took jesus for a prophet but it's a melody to say crucify him so we have to know what we went for in this message what did you go to see to receive and if you have believed what did you believe what is the message so when jesus went into the temple there was authority felt and today jesus comes into the temple which is temple the temple of his body the body of the bride and the authority this must be displayed and then the question begins to come where did you get this authority because the reality of what john introduced is now manifested in flesh he's walking on two feet and that's the answer i remember one brother was asking me brother abraham i had so and so tell me you prayed for him and and god healed him the constant you just prayed for him on the phone i said what's wrong so okay i wanted to ask you brother abraham um what are you becoming in this time are you another prophet are you another special brother to arise in the message i said come on what why are you asking me that i have never one day claimed that i'm a prophet i've never come here that i'm coming from uganda to come here and to prophesy about people discern people no i'm a preacher when you are questioning about the authority this ministry was it of william branham or was it from heaven where do we derive our authority is it from a man okay the minister of that man was it a man of god was it that he was trained was it because he was a good trader or raita good speaker fine polished fine character the man were accepted around the world supported by the denominational structures no who gave him authority the commission of an angel who sent the angel who was the angel [Applause] if you shall get the people to believe you if you shall be sincere and get the people to believe you nothing shall stand before you not even cancer where did the message come from where did the commission come from what was the source of the authority [Music] and he that receives a prophet in the name of the prophet received as a prophet said what and you know this is my time that's why i stand here and i have the privilege to step into the shoes of the supreme command as i was with moses so will i be with you as i was with elijah so will i be with you you are in the time of elisha [Music] who gave you this authority blessed be the name of the lord then i mean there is that question that there is that let me call it a vacuum that someone is not supposed to step there you are not supposed to say i mean one brother was telling me i was preaching somewhere and then he was telling me for us we don't believe in supernatural i said well that means you don't even believe in god because god is financial because i mean i believe in the spiritual god so he's not just spanish or by title he's exponential by action that is what he is and i'm not about here to talk about dead religion i said brother you see these things you know we we we have the word you are you know it's not about this and that i said what about the word the word made flesh what does it do you mean jesus was not the word i think jesus was the word made flesh he was the anointed one and what did he do he was not a backup unless we shall watch a man moving around looking down in the face of demons he was anointed wherever he went demons was screaming he was not running away from demons and hiding and trying to avoid the contact with demons and or cult world he knew who he was he was god many flesh so now the whole thing is because they have ended on the office of the prophet and the devil wants you as long as you end on the office of the prophet you are a very comfortable person for the devil very comfortable and the devil says please remain there but this one was more than a perfect just like john the baptist was more than a prophet so the more part going beyond the office here to what was introduced is what the devil doesn't want but i'm not here to give the devil what he wants remember he was the embodiment of the mysterious but glorious reality of the more than a prophet ministry jesus was amen blessed be the name of the lord and now today the source of his authority that is in us should be the product of the fact that we received the god we received what god sent beyond the office because the office just delivered what was handed over to it to deliver and i want you to look at jesus when he is introduced in the world you look at something strange here i mean how the angel was introducing jesus to the mother the physical marry you look at this verse here in john i mean luke chapter 1 in luke chapter 1 in verse 35 he says and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee now listen there are for also that holy thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god now can you imagine god calling this person that is going to be born a holy thing not the right reverent doctor most holy precious an angel is describing jesus and he says that holy thing that shall be born of you now if jesus the one you are going to deliver is the holy thing not even a gentle man not the right reverend this phd this and that a whole thing because it's just going to do a particular work a particular service he stepped into time and put on this flesh this flesh is a thing the purpose for the flesh is the most important thing not the flesh the flesh is the thing and if you want to be treated with dignity with respect you feel that you know embracing the reality of the message is going to be to turn you into a fanatic people are going to look at you as some you know already degraded the ranged you know person and so i cannot go the other side i have to remain in the office lest i become a thing i was telling brother child when he was you know i pray i say sometimes god can't even put you there so you just become a necessary evil they ask you can be a necessary evil that people even only run into when they must but you're not even bother i mean you don't matter most of the time you are nothing so when you come to serving god if god could declare and call his own himself a thing and then you want to be some special big brother this sister this and everybody say coming greeting and say you are the man of the hour uh we really love you brother we i mean don't you bother whether all people call you a thing whether everybody sees you nothing after all that is the description of how god described himself when he came that body is a thing but the purpose this which the body is going to serve is the greatest thing it's the most important part but the body is a thing so this bird of yours is a thing but the reality the purpose why we are here is the most important the devil wants to always have feelings and because of those feelings and association if i believe this if i go beyond the prophet and yet i must go beyond step beyond the prophet's office and then all my friends my associates my my my other brothers that we preach the same line of vision will will see me as a thing jesus never gave himself god never gave himself a good name he never gave himself a title he told the mayor you are going to produce a thing a thing that is going to be stunned that is going to be spot on that's going to be killed that's going to be hanged naked that's going to be laughed at and beaten you know until it will be shapeless so the purpose is beyond the purpose is beyond the flesh so the flesh is a thing so we can begin to look at this now how that the church wants to remain within the comfort zone you regard so much your body but your body is a thing that one day will die if it is a tomorrow anyway but if he doesn't die then what is going to happen just excuse me what is going to happen what's going to happen it will need more than the body to transform you i was telling that brother you you believed to go and you go in the rupture and said yes i said want itself be supernatural how will you go into the rupture how will you be changed would that take supernatural power and yet you don't believe in the spinach something is wrong somewhere blessed be the name of the lord glory glory so let's let's go down here the prophet says now listen listen to this you say brother abraham i have no power neither do i i don't have any power well brother branham i am a weakling so am i but i'm not depending in my oh on my strength it ain't my strength i'm depending on my authority see my authority given me is not means who is strong it ain't strength he is strong i am his so because i am his his strength his authority his power his anointing his glory is mine so i am the body that jesus is dwelling in now and i must go beyond the office because the office introduced christ introduced jesus that's what brother brahma did he introduced jesus and he's continues to say and he says let me leave this because i have here something he says john kept saying i am nothing i am nothing i'm not even worthy to lose his issues but now listen but what about when jesus just said about him he said who do you go out to see yeah yeah did you go to see a really shaken with a wind oh why did you go out to see some man in final rayman and luxor and things say they are in the king's palace but if you go to see a prophet i say yes and more than a prophet he was more than a prophet because he was a messenger of the confidence that's what he was he was more than a prophet and he said there's never been a man born of a woman as great as him to this time see he says that's what it was see he was a messenger of the covenant he was the one that introduced and he said this is him all other prophets spoke of him but john said this is him [Music] and we thank god that we are living in that time again we are not talking about talking this message doesn't talk about jesus this message is jesus [Applause] we don't point he people to him he's here he's in you as the brother i was preaching the other day you are just going to realize what is new that's all but he never wants to keep you pointing i'm waiting for jesus jesus will come come from where and go where blessed peter mother so he was the end of the covenant what was the covenant and revelation chapter 10 he comes down as the end of the covenant with the cloud with a raining ball [Music] with an opening book and the mysteries are you know revealed the thunders roll out and then you are supposed to go and take the book and eat the book in other words the continuation of the message of the covenant by that seminar and you got the angel and said give me the book so because he was the messenger of the covenant that's why he was greater than all born of women and for us we have double portion double person because we are also receiving the message of the messenger of the covenant so the angel with a book the angel of the covenant you go to him and take the book and eat the book and digest the book and then you are supposed to prophesy again not only that you are not just greater than he i mean like you are not in the capacity of john john was only greater than all that were born of women but for us we are born of the word the incorruptible seed the word of god himself and the prophet says if the devil wanted to stop it it's already spoke the word is already spoken unfortunately for the devil the word has already gone forth jesus god has already spoken it and the devil cannot and he do it he cannot make the word to be unspoken because it's already spoken and because spoken it is a seed that must come to pass and we had a manifestation of that and we are in the time of the glorious reality of the more than prophet mystery blessed be the name of the lord and that that reality he comes there he says of course he was not a reed shaken by denominational winds did you go to see that no not john you didn't go to see a sophisticated polished man of much education and good a good orator no you don't go to see a foolish faultless man with no error that's what they are looking for in the office of a prophet those are messages followers wherever the office goes they follow but for you you are not just a message believer but you are the message [Music] and that's why god made sure in this end the destiny of the book was not just to be in the mind or held somewhere or in your drawers not even just message books and message tips i have all the tips of brother branham i have all the books but receiving the fullness of that in you that's why it says take the book and eat it so the destiny of the book this time with you god makes sure the devil can't touch it again it's finished it's a done deal the devil is defeated i was telling one brother i said brother i'm not going to do any give you one time i don't have anything to listen from you if i'm deceived i'm comfortably deceived but i thank god you know i'm not deceived because the most glorious part of my testimony is that god led me to the message so you are not going to come around and tell me that this message is wrong when me in the depths of that jungle in africa god leads me to the message and he has told me that this is the truth that i told you that i read you too who are you blessed be the name of the lord now let me i looked at john the baptist critically i said show me five prophecies of john the baptist that he prophesied is going to happen and it happened john the baptist what did he prophesy but he was the major prophet why connecting all prophecy to reality [Music] that's the greatest prophecy and when they say we are going to prophesy again let me tell you something the culmination of all a prophecy of all the bible and all that we have preached and all the summons we have had is when you become him when you become the word until it will be like she is him [Applause] she has become exactly him that's what makes it a greater prophecy oh he prophesied this it didn't happen oh this one is yet to happen oh i mean they are looking at prophecies but johnny was the greatest prophet with no prophecies no signs no wonders show me how many people join me pray before they were here how many discernments let's go to the scriptures prove me by the scripture what prophecy did johnny make what disad me and yet he became the greatest of all greater than even isaiah who prophesied about the vagina and everything but this one is greater brother and moses yes the lord your god shall give you a sign there will be a man like me a prophet regret and this man is his brother and moses he's greater than jeremiah his greater than daniel his brother and all his prophets what is the criteria because he connected all prophecy to reality to the fulfilment glory be oh god and then you come today you people you are hearing all these forces these spirits that are trying to challenge the minister of brother and you know what they are trying to talk about some folks somewhere and i want to tell you they are there and god purpose that some of those folks be there that's why god intentionally left the mother says tamara and god never delivered moses from grace the wickedness of anger he was a prophet but he could bang down the tables of stone and break them yes he could smite the rock when they have told him to speak reaction of anger yes so did that disqualify him from bigger prophet amen so god left those things for a reason isn't it so if you don't go beyond more than a prophet those who are remaining holding a prophet the officer they took him for a prophet so he's responsible for his office we are going to examine him in his office we are going to look at him we are looking he is just a victim like i am he told us very clear he said american tutor says my mother was having a lot of anger that he could do what there's a way he started he steps it he was a mixture of indian blood and this and that and irish why did the god look at that pick that why some of us if we look at the clans the origins that we came from i sometimes sit there and say lord why did you pick me there's could have been some better people but god makes sure he picks those ones from wretched background rotten ones you can imagine even jesus when he was born from an immaculate conception god on purpose made him to grow up in nazareth so that he's even called jesus of nazareth a caste city of the cast and failures of people who are not prosperous until when i was in israel in 2006 even our tour guide didn't want to enter nazareth because nasa is up to now is looked on you know from that as a city of the cast the seat of the failures the feet the city of the ancestors unsuccessful and then jesus is called jesus off and then the sanhedrin could emphasize that on the purpose and they even one time told nicodemus when he was saying there's even an arrow permits us to kill someone until we have had him say are you also a guardian search check examine the scriptures out of galilee arises know what prophet he they were scriptural right but in their being right scripturally they were off from god's will a million miles god had intention intentionally placed jesus another race and even called by the name of the wicked city to blind any of them so god's ways are not our ways that's why i'm asking you to think about it as we shall continue why was this man greater go and read the bible and come with some proof that john prophesied how many prophecies did he give and how many came to pass how many failed you never gave any prophecy johnny simply said the only prophecy said this the one whom who was preferred before me whom i'm not even worthy to unite his issues he's here and then he went on to identify him say behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world and god had told him that the one that you will be baptizing and you see the sign of the dove coming down upon him he is him so that was not even discernment god had showed him it to be a sign he didn't see jesus and discerning him no but that sign was to come okay now what does jesus say jesus said if you are to receive it this is that elijah who was for to come if you are to receive it if you are designed if you are man that does receive it if you are one of those for whom this package of mysteries is given you'll receive him as elijah but if you are not among this one you will of course not take him as a prophet and you will be very right scripturally scientifically and everything you prove him out if you take him verbatim by what he will say what did he say are you elijah no are you not a prophet no who are you i'm just the voice of him that is to come and crying in the wilderness so brother i give you to understand the prophet this man you are calling a prophet himself he denied he said i'm not and brother branham many times he says i am not maybe the one i am laying the foundation for him to come i'm laying the foundation that is on purpose [Applause] on purpose that's why he said it is broken but it's not broken public is the seal is broken it's not broken it's it's not so we just switch on purpose and then the others were he had said they are not revealed they are not they have quotes and even those who say john the baptist is not a prophet they have a quote it's there in the bible it's written he denied it but jesus says if you are president [Music] this is him the elijah the alliance who wants to come so to you who are ready to receive it receive it and there are those who are not going to receive it they have their scripture this is to whom to those who take me me what i reveal to them and those who take the letter that is for those of the letter but this is to those who receive revelation now this is me revealing this to you he is him he is that prophet but the letter which is written there says he said i am not so the letter blinds them but now this is revelation so it's up to you which of the two are you going to take if you remain in the office of the prophet the prophet will deny that he is a prophet but if you go beyond more than a prophet and you go to what the prophet introduced so the one the prophet introduced will tell you the mystery of what he did and what he is and then you know how to treasure what he introduced [Applause] blessed be the name of the lord now you see was john the baptist is very successful in the ministry i bet not let's begin look at it how many disciples did he have not so many he baptized so many but how many remain in the church now let's look at how they were converted in john chapter one verse um in john chapter 1 verse 37 i mean satisfied i think let me look at that i have some little time john chapter one john chapter 1 verse 35 what does the bible say it says and the next day after jon stood and two of his disciples and looking upon jesus as he walked he says behold the lamb of god and the two disciples had him speak and he followed jesus why not all the disciples so the message even to the message believers was not to all the mysterious part that identifies the reality of the message was just made for very few and the bible says too why didn't he gather them all and just tell them that's the manner i was sent to introduce please me i'm disgreezing he must increase stop following me follow that man did he ever say that they still followed him and yet the reality was also there why didn't he say all of you pacquiao thinks follow that man it was to be done by revelation [Applause] by revelation not by command not by coercion yet they had believed the message but when he points out the reality of his message these ones the others are not seeing they are not even hearing but they are believing the message and they continue the following journey yet the one whom john had introduced had already come was on the sea but they still followed they still held on the office of the prophet yet the reality that the prophet introduced was here so the two who had followed why didn't others here isn't the bible interesting let's continue they followed him then jesus stand and saw them following he said congratulations you did he said congratulations you are the man of the hour praise the lord you've done it you've got it jesus stand and saw them following and he says unto him and to them what seeking what are you looking for and they say that to him rabbi and i said unto him rabbi which is to say being interpreted master where do it is down you see so you see the purpose of there following him was to go to where he dwells not because we have come to be blessed we've come to be healed we have come to get this we want you to do this for us but where do you dwell in my father's house are many mansions i go to prepare a place for you so the purpose of their following is to get to that i must reach his home i am the bride did you know that jesus said he didn't have where to dwell so where why particularly this time it was on purpose then he says unto them come and save and they came and saw where he dwelt and aborted with him that day for it was about in tennis hour now they even begin to name the names of those people but then the others remain among whom were those who were sent by john from prison go and find him ask him are you the one and there were message believers asking the reality of the message whether it is the truth that's why we still have people who are still believing the book is not open the scenes are not revealed the standards are all revealed and then they are looking to jesus when are you going to reveal these things well the prophet didn't finish everything we are looking for something can you give us the solution then we see another group a bunch of stunning baptists in acts chapter 19. about 12 of them who also get converted the letter in the apostolic ministry can imagine even the churches had it started deforming the pentecost was over the holocaust had come jesus even has left they missed the chance of walking with jesus physically and yet the main message of john was to point them to the messiah they missed the messiah they had to catch up later because it was not very clear it was not very direct that johnny would tell them please leave me got that man blessed be the name of the lord but we thank god that today's message is very clear but it's clear for those whose eyes have been enlightened but the rest of the people is still vague they are still even questioning whether the vindication of william ramos was enough millions of discernments and miracles and signs and wonders still is not enough and john the baptist who had not even won miracle he's believed to be a prophet you see the hypocrites of man why because john the baptist is in the past so it becomes very easy to believe that which is not of your age that which is past but now that which is of our debt blessed be the name of the lord so friend what went you out to see what do you come here to hear i was telling brother chad when we started preaching the message it was the dream of preachers around the world those days there were no tips were not there you could hear one person with a tape and everybody i want a tape a book was a message book was so precious you would just pick it from one another time came we had enough books enough tips but they became weaker we didn't have guitars we didn't have pianos and organs and so forth and we could sing if we had instruments in the church the music would be so good and people would enter in the spirit and worship the lord and then when we got the fast guitar the piano some of us know maybe here it's cheaper to get to them easier but not in our place so we people thought when we have a public address system and the church is having you know is good speakers and he has instruments for music and we have good song leaders and we have a good we shall have made it we had all those things and we have become ones we have had very good summons very good preachers until we become big-headed and just intelligent because we were thinking somebody's going to do for you a religion somebody's going to bring christ and throw him at you on your laps and say this is jesus no let's go to perfection [Music] when those two heard they followed when you hear when you are you when the reality is identified go to it go to where the reality is now become it because we are going beyond now a church building a church service a church membership time has come to go beyond that beyond being just a message believer subscribing to certain doctrines it's not just even doctrine there are people who have got been very good very balanced in doctrines and now they are completely aware of come to organize organize the chaos finished and then you sit down and say what happened to that brother what happened the other one because they stuck they got stuck at the office holy prophet god set him prophet god sent a prophet one time i was you know i was in kampala and i was with another pastor i had gone to buy there's a brother who wanted to buy a vehicle and we got a mechanic who was a pentecostal to go and check the cars and so forth and we took time i i preached to the man and the man really got touched and then he says where is your church here in campara i would want to go and attend so i pointed it to the other pastor i said and then he went to the other pastor he says how do i reach your church where is it located how is it called and you know the greatest embarrassment that i got this is the man who a pastor who answers this one and says well have you heard of a bunch of people who are called branamites well we are branamites and then the parliament the custom pastor came to me and said so excuse me sir so you are branhamites you are not christians i said well maybe for him he is still at the door of bradham may i receive the christ because branny had pointed me to christ so i'm actually genuinely christian and you know that's the reason many ministries have not even been successful in evangelism because they all remind a person is do you know god sent a prophet i mean what does this person have to do with it god is sending a prophet he's a baby he doesn't even know the bible he doesn't know nothing in the bible and you are just giving throne throwing a burn to a baby and you expect this baby to chew the bone and he and then i asked him brother i said why did you say brother i'm not ashamed of the prophet i said a prophet now can you tell this man the prophet the prophecies of the prophet that can save him tell him the prophecies of the prophet that can save him now it's beyond the prophet it's the message he was a prophet messenger so you take the message that a prophet brought and live that life that presents that message but very many people are comfortable with that you have no problem i mean you can have as many you know photos of the prophet on your wall in your house can't even put it in your office but that does not bring christ in your life you can be so bold to be identified with a person of brother abraham but you are ashamed to be identified by the life of the man that the prophet identified the prophet introduced that's the reality and that's what is going to take us home glory be to god christ in you the hope of glory christ in the temple walking in the temple and then when the denomination is beginning to ask him what authority who gave you this authority because i received the reality that the prophet introduced so the reality now workers in the temple is here i am the answer to the question i have the answer to the question of the origin of authority the origin of authorities because i received the reality the message of the messenger i really am not stuck at the door of the office i'm not just holding him my prophet is my prophet okay why did he what did he prophesy and then if he's your prophet do you know that this is the time you are also supposed to professor he was your prophet and you are supposed to be somebody's prophet so what are you doing about it now don't get stuck i believe in my prophet god sent a prophet that's very wonderful but you have forgotten that you are supposed to be prophesying you are also a prophet sent by god to another person to nations and tongues and languages and multitudes glory to god god beyond more than a prophet he was more although he didn't make many prophets yeah i mean prophecies john was not really with thousands of prophecies that came to pass he prophesied this it happened he prophesied it happened this is what we are sometimes i i was telling one brother i don't have time to talk about prophecies there are thousands you listen to the tips read the books don't tell me about prophecies they are there we are now talking about the revealed one the reality that that prophet that prophet prophetic office pointed us to he says he is here he said look at your clock it's now two is it 2 30 pm end of second pool beginning of saturday pool [Applause] what is it the story pool what is the third pool the sword of the king that means the king is here he's holding the sword somebody go and receive this food hallelujah and for you you are pointing to who he was more than a prophet and friends this is our time let me finish by this he says 30 years after the birth of jesus there was that prince among the prophets and brother abraham is calling john the baptist the prince among the prophets so he was a prince prophet oh my john the baptist amen i mean all men knowed he was a prophet from god the foreigner of coming christ now they didn't all know that there is it is which is predicted again in the last days so we are going to have a prince of all prophets another one why he identifies the masterpiece the masterpiece groom for the masterpiece bride and there must be an invisible union so jesus said what would you go to see i really shake i mean what are we looking for we have looked for ministries and ministries have failed us we have looked for great preachers and great preachers have failed us we have looked for brothers to trust and brothers have let us down we have looked for good sisters and they can let you down but there is one that will never let you down and he came down himself that's why he came down he knew you would need him and that's why he took our america he fought so that we are not having our fixation on a man called william branham but the man who came the one who descended the one was identified the one was responsible for the continuation of this voice ministry of the bride the voice of christ himself in the body in the bright body so what are you looking for we are not looking for these ribs that are shaken by every today's this tomorrow is that you will see that in them if you are looking for great man john was not that amen and that's why john prophesied for only six months that's what the prophet says six months that was enough his message was very short what else should we do and he's the greatest of all of them the prince prophet rather even if you had it just two days is enough i i you need to experience that before we go home blessed but be the name of the lord he says he was not just to keep his clothes so and so and matching and this and tell him how he must dress and them kind that kisses the babies and staying kicking king's palaces and talks to public schools and so forth he was not a warrior he was not out from the line i mean he didn't even know how to handle a to edge this word so he says they are the kind that does that but what did you go out to see a prophet and now i say more than a prophet and then he says now listen to this great priest coming with a piece of sheep's skin wrapped around him living off the hubs of the woods hallelujah no theological seminary experience behind him but an experience that he had talked to god he had it from heaven and he was born for the purpose to do it the word spoke that he would come yes sir walked out on the banks of jordan with his feet in the mud don't you think you pharisees to say we have abraham to our father if i tell you god deserves these stones to raise up children to abraham you know that's what then he says that prince of the prophets the one that had the privilege of introducing the messiah and he saw the sign of the messiah and recognized it as that light fell from heaven isn't that what the prophet saw when he was baptizing the 17th pastor you know that and he says went upon him and he was witness to it so we see the repeat of that today so he comes and says nobody knows much about him he was just a man he was but he was a prophet he was hated my and what time did he rise right in the time of the popularity of israel when they had all went wildly and he got it out of there and it was a woman hater inverted you know he is inverted he was a woman hater yes sir she was and he loved the wilderness that was his nature and then people ought to know to have known when the pharaoh came out with that same spirit on him and came out this john not dressed all up like the celebrity as i said last night they kissed the babies and marian barr and so forth but this calm man came out of the wilderness a man what was he he loved the wilderness another thing he did he hated denomination now he was no compromiser he's describing john the type that was greater than all prophets loved the wilderness was a woman hater he could not compromise on the world he wasn't educated so what are we going to do with this man in this educated age with scientific examining research for minds that can suck things at the tip of the finger prove this wrong prove that right tick this cross these cans of this let me finish there are so many things but let me leave them he says now as a preacher i don't think that jesus was a great outstanding forceful preacher john the baptist was a preacher but he done no signs at all at all he never performed a miracle this is the prophet speaking but jesus came by not preaching so forceful as john but there were signs and wonders accompanying him now you look at it jesus is not as forceful but signs and wonders john is so forceful brief time no signs no in the wonders no miracles and no many prophecies but we believe him but heaven declared him as the greatest and the devil in this day is trying to you know blank out the ministry of william runner and trying to point out this and that and that and who are doing it those whose whose eyes were once enlightened tested of the good heavenly word preached it carried the evidence and showed others this land is good they have turned against it what is this for to prove to us that unless you go beyond the office of a prophet and take that reality that is beyond that office you are going to fail just one more thing here he says so i want to say this i've never said it before but according to scripture according to what he said 30 years 30 years ago 33 years ago on the river down there in 1933 rather what he said everything has happened just exactly the prophet didn't say it was going to happen he said it has already happened this is the message look away to jesus in other words look away from me look away from the prophet look away to jesus it's he says it has already happened why did he do this the angel tell him 1933 as john was sent to forerun the first coming of jesus so shall your message foreign this second introduce jesus to the bride so he says it has already happened so jesus was already there while john is also elijah is also still around so those who wanted still remained with elijah elijah or john but those who saw and had the mystery followed jesus others will follow later but the message is such that you can actually comfortably remain at the office of the prophet or you can catch by revelation and go beyond more than the prophetic office so that you stop hearing this halabu that is going on around the prophetic office close your ears to this you are beyond that you have already left the office the office has already done its work they appointed you to the man so he says it has already happened exact just exactly i may not do it but this message will introduce jesus christ to the world and he says as john the baptist was sent to foreign they first come now listen to this this statement is confusing like it appears because he says what he told me has already happened in other words i have already introduced him but then he says i may not do it same quote same place [Laughter] i may not do it but this message like in acts 19 can introduce the others letter to him but those who have picked the cue by revelation now they have already seen him just like john the baptist was sent to foreign the first coming so is this the message to foreign the second coming and john said behold the lamb of god that takes away the seed of the word in other words it was not the message after john it was john speaking introducing the reality when he was still alive and those who caught it by revelation followed by those who deemed waited until he was dead then they followed okay so he says it is paralleled in it's it's paralleled in it everywhere i know it will the message will go on now in other words how does it parallel i must decrease that's what john is saying i must decrease he must increase so john the messenger the office ends and then the message goes on what was the message the word incarnate jesus christ the messiah because who caught it followed him the message those who didn't remain here and calling themselves believers of the prophet's message but what is the message well we believe the message but what is the message now i believe the message brother what is the message system what is the message brother you will stay here or you will fall there the message will go on glory be to god so let me end there i think i i will not finish everything here but he comes here final and he says but as soon as jesus appeared he had a sign as soon as jesus appeared he had a sign a pill of fire a light above him like a dove coming down a voice saying this is my beloved son human we are pleased notice and john immediately said i must decrease he and he must increase he presented the church to christ amen and we are told that in the last days that will repeat again there is going to be a message come forth that will introduce the messiah to the people and it will be in such a way they will stand listen they will stand dumbfounded like they did it then but he promised it damn founded where is he i've believed i thought this message is the truth i believed it is the reality but you are stuck at the office go beyond the office more than the prophet there is something laying beyond there may god bless you let's stand up [Applause] well if you may be if you want to be remembered in prayer wherever you are i know this is to us all and we need christ standing in this day where there is a lot of forces that are fading trying to fail people but there is one promised guarantee that the elected will not be deceived and when you hack in his voice when you hear his voice saying come up here leave the church age touch edges come out of laodicea this is where you belong come to the reality take your position in the blood of christ don't get stuck in laodicea if you want to be remembered in prayer wherever you are just lift up your hand to the lord and we pray loving heavenly father what a time that we are living in the lord we have come as far as believing the message but you are telling us there is a mystery that goes beyond a prophetic office like john the baptist was he was more than a prophet and you could not look at so many prophecies that he made not signs not wonders but he connected all promises all prophecy to the reality and he became the greatest help us lord to recognize what you want us to be where you want us to be what you want us to become that lord we shall be those temples that the dynamics are walking in the temples that christ the zoe is tabernacled and lord that will be the end result the product of what was introduced by this prophetic office for you are coming to pick a part of yourself to take home you are not just coming to pick a message believer may you help us lord to know that god time is late and that god is time for the manifestation of the sons of god the daughters of god and that god that's the requirement of the hour may the holy spirit may the person of christ yourself come and dwell in us in our hearts by faith that it will be christ in us the hope
