[1:58] You ask me why I'm happy, so I'll just
[2:02] tell you why. Because
[2:05] my sins are gone.
[2:08] And when I meet the scoffers who ask me
[2:12] where they are, I say,
[2:15] "My sins are gone.
[2:18] They're underneath the blood of the
[2:21] cross of Calvary.
[2:23] as far removed as darkness is from God.
[2:28] In the sea of God's forgetfulness,
[2:31] that's good enough for me. Praise God,
[2:35] my sins are gone.
[2:38] Was at the old time altar where God came
[2:42] in my heart and now
[2:45] my sins are gone.
[2:48] The Lord took full possession. The devil
[2:51] did. I'm glad
[2:55] my sins are gone. Well, they are
[2:58] underneath the blood of the cross of
[3:01] Calvary.
[3:03] As far removed as darknesses from God
[3:07] in the sea of God's forgetfulness,
[3:10] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[3:14] My sins are gone.
[3:17] When Satan comes to tempt me and tries
[3:20] to make me down, I say
[3:24] my sins are gone.
[3:27] You got me into trouble, but Jesus got
[3:31] me out. I'm glad
[3:34] my sins are gone. Oh, they are
[3:37] underneath the blood of the cross of
[3:40] Calvary.
[3:42] as far removed as darkness is from God.
[3:46] In the sea of God's forgetfulness,
[3:49] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[3:53] My sins are gone.
[3:56] I'm living now for Jesus. I'm happy
[3:59] night and day because
[4:03] my sins are gone.
[4:06] My soul is filled with music. With all
[4:09] my heart I sing.
[4:12] Yes, I know my sins are gone. Oh,
[4:15] they're underneath the blood of the
[4:18] cross of Calvary.
[4:20] As far removed as darkness is from God
[4:25] in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[4:28] That's good enough for me. Praise God.
[4:32] My sins are gone. Praise God. Praise
[4:35] God.
[4:37] My sins are gone.
[4:39] Praise God.
[4:42] My sins are gone.
[4:45] Amen. Let's just give the Lord a hand

[13:38] Amen. God bless you all. We're going to
[13:41] let you have your seats for just a
[13:42] minute. We got some announcements to
[13:43] make. Thank you, musicians. You can you
[13:46] can be excused. Uh I just want to remind
[13:48] you that uh brother Gabe Smith is in
[13:50] Dton again this morning preaching, so we
[13:52] don't want to forget him. And also I
[13:56] wanted to say I enjoyed the reception
[13:57] yesterday for brother Wesley and sister
[13:59] Anne. It was good to have them here and
[14:02] uh appreciate uh uh sister Tanya and all
[14:04] the work and her and her staff of
[14:06] helpers put together. They had a
[14:08] beautiful reception and I'm excited for
[14:10] the Godfree family. And also it was nice
[14:12] to have Ann's parents come and join us
[14:14] and to have us in service. So God bless
[14:16] you. It's good to have you guys here
[14:17] with us this morning. So it's been nice
[14:19] as we got to see you there and we got to
[14:21] see you here. So that's been really
[14:22] good. Amen. And so we enjoy having them
[14:24] here and we're excited for their future.
[14:27] Amen.
[14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Also, we have some visitors here
[14:30] from the UK. There was two sisters that
[14:31] were traveling into the US from UK and
[14:35] they decided to stop and join us for the
[14:37] service. Sister Jane and Sister Becky,
[14:40] where are you all back here? God bless
[14:41] you. It's good to have you in the
[14:43] service and welcome. And I'm glad you
[14:45] included us in your itinerary while here
[14:47] in the United States. That's nice.
[14:49] There's also a family visiting with the
[14:50] small family here. Brother Ben and his
[14:52] family back over here. God bless you.
[14:54] It's good to have you all here again
[14:55] this morning. And any other visitors, we
[14:58] we appreciate you joining us. We want
[15:00] you to feel very welcome and at home.
[15:03] And also, I wanted to let you know that
[15:05] uh brother Franco and sister Amy and
[15:08] Pipa along with uh Vidy and and Maria
[15:11] have traveled to Italy. So, this is the
[15:13] trip that the church has part at least
[15:16] partially gifted for brother Franco for
[15:18] his 30 years of service. So, I just want
[15:20] us all to remember them in prayer. We
[15:22] just want to ask God's blessings to
[15:23] shower upon them and that everything
[15:25] would work out perfect because this is
[15:27] part of a thank you from us to him and
[15:29] for brother Franco and Sister Amy and
[15:31] for all they've done. And so, I I've
[15:33] been praying that God would just make it
[15:35] a wonderful time for them. They got
[15:37] quite a fam a bit of family they're
[15:39] going to visit. They haven't seen for a
[15:40] really long time. Pipa's never met some
[15:42] of her family. They're in Italy. Sister
[15:44] Maria is going to get to spend time with
[15:46] her brother. And so I just pray it's a
[15:48] marvelous, wonderful, perfect trip
[15:51] &gt;&gt; that everything goes well for our
[15:53] brother. He's never they they those two
[15:55] have never missed this many services and
[15:57] been gone this long. And they planned it
[15:59] over retreat so that they wouldn't miss
[16:01] services here cuz that's how faithful
[16:03] they are that they're going to miss the
[16:04] retreat that they would like to be at,
[16:06] but they they want to be at their post
[16:08] of duty and doing what they're supposed
[16:10] to do. So it was a bit of arm twisting
[16:12] to get them to go and miss this many
[16:13] services, but we're just thankful. So
[16:16] they have been absolutely faithful for
[16:18] 30 years. But also I want to thank the
[16:21] crew that they left behind to help them
[16:22] because I can't do this by myself. It's
[16:25] impossible. So sister Nita Hatfield,
[16:28] she's running the video things today and
[16:30] brother Anthony Golden, they've been
[16:32] helping them for quite a while now
[16:33] learning the ropes. But recently,
[16:35] Brother Sam Pittenberger has been
[16:36] joining upstairs to help with the video
[16:38] and so he's been helping as well. And
[16:41] then very recently, brother Peter Brooks
[16:43] joined the team and uh he did my
[16:46] PowerPoint this morning. He probably
[16:48] wishes I didn't tell you now in case
[16:51] something goes wrong, but if anything
[16:52] goes wrong, it's my fault, not his. He
[16:54] probably would rather I tell you
[16:56] afterwards, but anyways, cuz Frank
[16:58] always takes my notes and converts them
[17:00] to a PowerPoint in the morning and and I
[17:02] emailed those and and Peter took care of
[17:04] it for us. So, God bless you and thank
[17:06] you.
[17:07] So, I appreciate all those who are
[17:08] jumping in to help out and and make it
[17:10] work and and I'm I'm so grateful and so
[17:13] grateful they were able to take the
[17:14] pressure off brother Frank and sister
[17:15] Amy so that they could go and so just
[17:17] remember them in prayer.
[17:20] Also, uh the retreat will be this
[17:22] Thursday. We start we meet over there.
[17:24] The service will be at 7 and we will not
[17:26] have Wednesday night service here that
[17:28] Wednesday night's canceled. We'll be
[17:29] meeting over there on Thursday. And
[17:32] also, brother Daniel White and his
[17:33] family will be coming in. And so just
[17:34] pray for them that their travels all
[17:36] work out well coming and going. And uh I
[17:39] had been with Daniel, you know, about
[17:41] two years ago uh when my girls and I
[17:44] traveled over there. And he was just
[17:46] sharing with me some things he had been
[17:48] teaching his church on families and
[17:50] relationships and and the inner workings
[17:52] of relationships. And as he described it
[17:54] to me, I just really enjoyed his
[17:56] approach. I enjoyed his insight and and
[17:58] the way that he ministered. So I said,
[18:00] "Would you come and do our retreat?" and
[18:03] I told him kind of what it was and he
[18:05] agreed. I thank God he agreed he's
[18:07] coming and so I didn't tell him what to
[18:10] preach but I told him I liked when he
[18:11] preached that. So I kind of think that's
[18:14] what he's going to cover and we've had
[18:15] some conversation but he hasn't told me
[18:17] all the details but you know all of us
[18:19] are part of relationships part of
[18:21] families in one way or another and and
[18:23] we have relationship with each other and
[18:24] and his insight I found to be just
[18:26] really good really helpful and good
[18:28] teaching. So I told him I want him to
[18:30] come and relax, which for Daniel that's
[18:32] not a problem. He's good at being
[18:33] relaxed. The Australians are good at
[18:35] being relaxed. You know, they say it
[18:37] come right mate. And to slow that down
[18:40] for us here in America, it'll come out
[18:43] all right, friend.
[18:46] But they shorten everything because
[18:48] they're so relaxed. They don't even
[18:49] speak in full sentences. It'll come
[18:51] right me. So I told him just to relax,
[18:55] just take his time. It's a casual
[18:56] setting and just for us to enjoy. And so
[18:59] just come expecting, amen, for God to
[19:01] teach us, amen, to instruct us on some
[19:03] of the things in our lives. So I'm
[19:05] looking forward to that and for having
[19:07] him here with us. Plus, his accent is
[19:09] just really cool to listen to.
[19:12] So amen. So yeah, we'll be looking
[19:16] forward to that this weekend and just
[19:17] keep that in prayer as well that
[19:19] everybody travels there and everything
[19:20] works out well. And God has certainly
[19:22] blessed us the last two times we've
[19:24] been. We thoroughly enjoyed it and I'm
[19:26] very much looking forward to sharing
[19:27] that time together again. And then there
[19:31] was one more thing that I wanted to
[19:32] share with you. I think um most of you
[19:34] may have heard but not all that brother
[19:36] Ed Bisll had passed away this past
[19:39] Wednesday. So he passed away Wednesday
[19:40] evening and I just wanted to share just
[19:43] a few pictures. Brother, brother Bisco,
[19:46] and I'm sure there's churches all over
[19:47] the world that are going to be saying
[19:49] something today. But brother Ed Biscoll
[19:51] was a special brother. Very special
[19:53] brother. The Lord used him mightily. He
[19:56] had quite a ministry for a long time. He
[19:57] was quite a witness of the things that
[19:59] he had saw and heard in Brother Ram's
[20:02] ministry, but he was able to carry on.
[20:04] It wasn't just that he was a witness. He
[20:06] was able to take the the the revelation
[20:08] that Brother Bram delivered and he was
[20:10] able to carry it on. and he did so much
[20:13] work around the world and we just really
[20:15] respect our brother and admire him and
[20:18] uh he was an inspiration to me. There's
[20:20] many things that he preached that just
[20:21] absolutely were so fantastic and uh so
[20:24] helpful to me. But as far as the Lima
[20:27] area, Brother Biscll's been instrumental
[20:30] in this area from the very beginning. He
[20:32] was instrumental when when the message
[20:34] was coming to Lima and just beginning to
[20:36] form and instrumental in the forming of
[20:38] the first church here as the saints were
[20:40] gathering together. Some of you were
[20:42] there, some of you remember it. I know
[20:44] uh I know the Woods were there, Brother
[20:46] Dave and Sister Bessie, and they
[20:48] remember a lot of that. And so he just
[20:50] has quite a tie in with us here. And
[20:52] also, he did quite a bit of traveling
[20:54] with Brother Lonnie. Brother Lonnie and
[20:56] him together did a lot of work around
[20:58] the world. And brother Ed's been a part
[21:01] of our camps here in 1999. He was part
[21:04] of our family camp. He he came back
[21:07] again in 2005 and they were in the
[21:09] studio there doing Global Answers. And
[21:12] then this picture we have here is when
[21:14] he was here in 2015. Many of you
[21:17] remember we had our uh I think it was
[21:20] the 25th anniversary of the church and
[21:22] he came to preach those meetings and
[21:24] they were fantastic. Amen. And I I was
[21:26] so blessed and that's when I really had
[21:28] more personal contact with him on that
[21:30] trip there and and he was such a
[21:33] gentleman,
[21:34] so kind and uh he and his family
[21:38] interacted with my family and and I just
[21:41] I I thank God that God had such a
[21:44] gentleman, such a such a figure, such a
[21:47] ministry, such a gift that he gave to
[21:49] us. And I feel a loss. uh and and he
[21:51] hasn't been ministering for a while
[21:53] because uh he's not been able to. I
[21:55] think he was 90 years old when he passed
[21:57] away. So, we were feeling that loss as
[21:59] his ministry declined. But now that he's
[22:01] gone, it feels like we've lost
[22:03] something. But, you know, in the kingdom
[22:05] of God, there is no losing
[22:08] &gt;&gt; because we're going to meet our brother
[22:10] again. Amen. And he's gone to a reward.
[22:12] And I I pray that I believe that he's
[22:14] having a a wonderful time that he would
[22:16] never come back. But, uh we feel the
[22:19] loss. And I just pray that God will help
[22:21] us to carry on with the message. And I
[22:25] just want to pray for his family. I want
[22:26] to pray for sister Ruth and the family
[22:28] and like to also pray for their church.
[22:30] So if we could stand this morning and
[22:32] I'd like as a congregation for us to
[22:34] just pray for them and just remember
[22:35] them this morning. Let's bow our heads
[22:38] together.
[22:40] Dear heavenly father, we thank you Lord
[22:42] Jesus for gathering us here together
[22:45] again, for drawing us, Lord. for no man
[22:48] can come to you unless you draw them.
[22:50] We're so thankful, God, that you've been
[22:52] constant in our lives, that you have
[22:54] sustained us and you've healed us and
[22:56] you've kept us and you keep bringing us
[22:58] back again. And we know that it's your
[23:00] abundant grace in our lives. And Lord,
[23:03] as we reflect on the life of our brother
[23:05] Bisco, Lord, and the impact that he's
[23:07] had on each one of us in different ways,
[23:09] me personally, Lord, he was such a
[23:12] gentleman, so kind and encouraging, and
[23:14] I just appreciate that, Lord. I
[23:16] appreciate the work that you did through
[23:17] him. And we just pray, God, that we
[23:19] would be vessels that you could work
[23:21] through, that we would surrender our
[23:23] lives to you. And God, as we stand here
[23:26] together this morning, we just remember
[23:28] Sister Ruth. And we ask that you'd be
[23:29] with her, Lord. That you would comfort
[23:31] her, Lord, with a very special comfort.
[23:33] May it be tangible. May she feel your
[23:36] presence and and your embrace. May you
[23:38] comfort her and the rest of the family,
[23:40] his children and and his uh
[23:43] grandchildren and great and great great
[23:44] great grandchildren. May you bless all
[23:46] of them and the assembly, Lord, also at
[23:49] Cloverdale Bible Way. Would you just
[23:50] comfort them, Lord, as no doubt they
[23:52] feel such a loss and losing their pastor
[23:55] so long, Lord? And I just pray, Lord,
[23:58] that you would comfort them and you
[24:00] would bless them. And may they also
[24:02] continue on in the word, Lord. May the
[24:04] legacy of our brother, what's left
[24:06] behind in the memory is his passion and
[24:08] love for the truth that inspired us to
[24:11] have a passion and love for your truth.
[24:13] And may we honor his memory by
[24:15] continuing on in the thing that he loved
[24:17] moving forward progressing in this
[24:19] message. And God, may we each one do our
[24:22] part as well. We ask that you would
[24:24] bless this service this morning. that I
[24:26] pray you take this vessel of mine under
[24:28] your control and that you'd speak
[24:30] through these lips, Lord, your eternal
[24:31] words, Lord, words of life. That you
[24:33] would plant them in our hearts and that
[24:35] we would forever be changed. God, we
[24:38] come, Lord, not out of tradition. We
[24:40] don't come, Lord, for a ceremony, but we
[24:43] come to meet with you. We come to hear
[24:45] from you. We come to be changed by the
[24:47] word that you sew in our hearts, Lord.
[24:49] We come to grow. We come to be shaved
[24:52] down. We come to be shaped and molded
[24:54] into your very image for this hour. And
[24:56] I pray that you would do that work in us
[24:58] now as we gather. May you have
[25:00] preeminence among us. May you move as
[25:03] you wish as we surrender to you. In
[25:05] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[25:10] Amen. Let's uh take our Bibles and turn
[25:12] to the book of Revelation. While we're
[25:14] standing together, let's look at
[25:17] Revelation chapter 10.
[25:28] Revelation chapter 10
[25:32] uh and verse 7.
[25:39] But in the days of the voice of the
[25:40] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[25:42] sound, the mystery of God should be
[25:44] finished, as he has declared to his
[25:47] servants, the prophets. Amen. and God
[25:49] bless you as you have your seat.
[25:52] Amen. This is um scripture we're
[25:55] familiar with. We've been reading it a
[25:57] lot. We've been reading it a lot since
[25:58] we came to the message
[26:01] &gt;&gt; because this has to do with the day and
[26:03] age we live in. The purpose of the
[26:04] message and why God sent a prophet and
[26:06] it means so much to us. Amen. So, it
[26:09] seems like I I don't mean to become
[26:12] routine or to get into habits or become
[26:14] boring in any way, but it seems like
[26:16] every service we either have to start in
[26:17] Genesis or Revelation because they're
[26:20] just connected. It's alpha and omega and
[26:22] we see the seed in the seed and and it
[26:24] has everything to do with where we are.
[26:26] But if we could pull up the PowerPoint,
[26:28] please, we can see uh I've been we've
[26:31] been preaching during a certain theme,
[26:32] you know, with pick up your pen and
[26:34] write. And it's led us into a certain
[26:35] stream and and I want to continue on
[26:37] with that this uh this morning. And I
[26:40] want to preach on a super sign. And I
[26:42] just see some things that Brother Rem
[26:44] said about that and how it relates to
[26:46] us. And and when I looked at this, I
[26:48] just got so excited. I just I I can't
[26:50] help it. I just get so thrilled. I mean,
[26:53] when when you think of Bible days are
[26:55] here again. We're living in the
[26:57] fulfillment of prophecy. And it's not to
[26:59] me, it's not just that I'm living and
[27:01] I've seen prophecy over there and I've
[27:03] seen prophecy over there. But the
[27:05] realization keeps coming that I am the
[27:08] prophecy. That I'm in the prophecy. I'm
[27:11] not I'm not walking near it. I'm not
[27:13] seeing it a far off. I've not observed
[27:15] it. But that prophecy has everything to
[27:18] do with my purpose on this earth. And
[27:20] I'm not only connected to it and it's
[27:23] connected to me, but that prophecy is
[27:25] actually being fulfilled in me. Uh and
[27:27] and and what's different in this day
[27:29] than it was when God sent John the
[27:31] Baptist or God sent, you know, Malachi 4
[27:34] is that prophecy was all wrapped up in
[27:36] that one individual. But now this
[27:38] prophecy is fulfilled in a many membered
[27:41] body. And so may I only may have a
[27:43] portion of that. I only may have a
[27:44] dropper full, but it doesn't change
[27:46] anything. I'm part of it.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not all wrapped up in me. I'm
[27:51] not all of it. I can't express it all. I
[27:53] can't even I can't even manifest it all.
[27:55] Amen. But whatever portion I am, Amen.
[27:58] I'm part of that word. Amen. I'm part of
[28:01] that prophecy to be fulfilled. And
[28:03] that's the realization that keeps
[28:04] coming. And when we say things like
[28:06] that, I mean, there's something inside
[28:08] of us that just responds because we've
[28:10] been eternally connected to this word.
[28:14] But then there's something that can take
[28:16] place in the outer man in our mind and
[28:18] say, "How can I say I'm the word? How
[28:20] can I say I'm part of the prophecy?"
[28:21] Because it's not me, but it's that part
[28:23] of me that's in me that was meant to be
[28:26] me. That part that was in the mind of
[28:28] God, the child of God, that's buried in
[28:30] my soul that's come to life by the
[28:32] quickening power of the Holy Ghost.
[28:34] That's the me I'm talking about. I'm not
[28:36] talking about this me that was born of
[28:37] mom and dad. That thing's corrupt. That
[28:39] thing's vile. It has to come under
[28:41] control of the Holy Ghost and will
[28:43] eventually be changed in the atoms
[28:45] completely.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; But when I say me, I'm not talking about
[28:49] this me because this me is there's
[28:50] nothing good there. And this me fails
[28:52] all the time and this me is still uh
[28:54] living in a in a in a in a cockleber
[28:57] shell. Amen. That that's me. But there's
[28:59] another me that's growing on the inside
[29:02] that is part of this word because it
[29:03] comes from the mind of God.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that realization is coming.
[29:09] We've known it. We talk about it. We've
[29:11] talked about it for decades. Amen. But
[29:14] it's becoming more of a realization in
[29:16] our lives. And I wanted to listen, this
[29:19] is my desire. And I'm just going to
[29:20] shoot shoot from the hip and hit it
[29:22] right between the eyes starting off. I
[29:25] want this revelation to move to a
[29:27] manifestation
[29:30] &gt;&gt; because we've had the revelation and the
[29:32] revelation is still growing. God is
[29:34] still unfolding the revelation. But this
[29:36] revelation must become a manifestation.
[29:39] Amen.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; And that's my great desire is to allow
[29:43] that revelation in my life to be a
[29:45] manifestation.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we look here at the message
[29:50] shalom said we heard the word say that
[29:52] in the days of the seventh angel in the
[29:55] church age, he just said the seventh
[29:56] angel's message would be the last
[29:58] message. And then oh, we find out over
[30:00] here in Revelation 10, in the days of
[30:02] the message of the seventh angel, the
[30:04] mysteries of God should be finished. the
[30:06] seventh seal would be pulled back. Amen.
[30:10] It should be there. Then all at once
[30:12] when it's happening, a vision broke said
[30:14] go to Tucson and a great noise will take
[30:16] place at this time. So you'll be
[30:18] thoroughly understanding and know that
[30:21] it's sent. It'll just shake the earth
[30:23] nearly. All of you know about it. It's
[30:25] on tape months before it happened. Then
[30:27] it happened. Then appeared in the sky.
[30:30] Shalom. What appeared in the sky? A
[30:32] cloud.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; What was that cloud? Shalom. It was a
[30:36] greeting. Peace. All is well. Good
[30:38] morning. Amen. Shalom. What is it? It's
[30:42] a changing beats. The sympathy or or the
[30:45] symphony is what brother was talking
[30:46] about. He's talking about and in and
[30:47] shalom. He tells a story of this great
[30:49] symphony. And he's talking about the
[30:51] symphony of Peter and the wolf, the
[30:52] Russian symphony that's played out in
[30:54] music. And and he says they act out the
[30:56] parts through the different beating of
[30:58] the drums and the playing of the
[30:59] clarinet and the obo and all these other
[31:01] parts. Amen. And he and he's talking
[31:02] about the great symphony of God is
[31:04] spelling out something. It's playing.
[31:05] It's coming to a conclusion. And the
[31:07] great writer wrote it and the great
[31:09] conductor is conducting it. And it's all
[31:11] telling the story dramatizing through
[31:14] the lives of individuals. Amen. Through
[31:16] this end time, dramatizing God's great
[31:18] mystery plan.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; But he says, "What is it? What is this
[31:22] uh uh mystery of God should be finished?
[31:24] That the seventh seal would be pulled
[31:26] back in this day." And he said, "When it
[31:28] was ready to happen," Amen. I got a I
[31:30] got a vision. and I was told to go to
[31:32] Tucson. Why? Because it's time for the
[31:34] seven seal to be pulled back,
[31:36] &gt;&gt; for the mystery to be revealed. And he
[31:39] said, "What is it?" It's a changing
[31:42] beats. It changed from church ages now
[31:46] to to the bride age and the seventh
[31:48] seal. It changed from working through
[31:50] denominations and working through
[31:51] systems to God himself working in his
[31:54] people on an individual level.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to back up a little bit and
[32:00] look here at this prophecy in Isaiah 7.
[32:03] Said, "Therefore, the Lord himself shall
[32:05] give you a sign. Behold, a virgin shall
[32:07] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[32:10] his name Emmanuel." Brother man points
[32:12] to this as the super sign as it come to
[32:15] be fulfilled. But there's a sign that a
[32:17] virgin shall conceive.
[32:21] All right. in in the message of super
[32:23] sign from 1959 he says you see in God's
[32:26] laws of redemption as it was with Boaz
[32:28] and Naomi it had to be a near kinsman
[32:31] and the only way that that man could be
[32:34] redeemed God had to become a kinsman
[32:36] near I want you to see it he never
[32:38] became kinfolks altogether to the rich
[32:41] to the mighty but he was born in the
[32:43] stable wrapped in swaddling cloth not to
[32:45] the adult but to a ch the child he was
[32:48] God over the creation he chose to do it
[32:51] not come a ful mature man. He came that
[32:53] he might suffer the feelings of the
[32:55] little babies. He came that he might go
[32:57] through the teenage temptations might go
[32:59] that he could toil the toils and snares
[33:02] of the devil as a man and make a way for
[33:04] the people of all ages of all ages and
[33:06] of all classes. The poor, the rich, the
[33:08] all. He became poor that through his
[33:10] poverty we might become rich and heirs
[33:12] with him in the kingdom. A sign would be
[33:15] given crossing himself making himself
[33:18] something different than what he was.
[33:20] Now a super sign crying as a baby,
[33:22] playing as a boy, toiling as a man. But
[33:25] it was God living in all stages of life
[33:27] like we do.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; What was a super sign? It was God living
[33:32] in human flesh through the stages of
[33:35] life like we do.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; Born like we're born. Amen. Dependent on
[33:40] parents like we're dependent on parents.
[33:42] Eating food and growing and learning and
[33:44] and all of the things that we do. What
[33:46] was it? It was a super sign. God
[33:48] manifesting in flesh as a man.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Here in 1961 in Super Sign, he says, "No
[33:57] matter how much they didn't receive it,
[33:59] it was there just the same. No matter
[34:01] how much they don't receive it today and
[34:03] want manmade achievement, God's sign
[34:06] still remains the same. A super sign.
[34:08] Not a polished up thing of the world
[34:10] with a lot of education and man-made
[34:12] achievement. No, not that. Not things of
[34:14] the world or anything tacked to the
[34:16] world." He said, "I'm not of the world."
[34:18] Well, what will it be? It will be God
[34:21] made flesh among us. God made flesh
[34:24] among us. That will be the super sign.
[34:27] God and flesh ought to be striking to
[34:30] the world. Jehovah, God became one of
[34:32] us. Changed his cast from great immortal
[34:35] Jehovah. Jehovah to become a little
[34:37] infant baby. Amen. So what is super what
[34:39] is the super sign? God made flesh among
[34:42] us.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:47] See, in everything we preach and
[34:48] everything we talk about, everything
[34:50] brother Brennham brought us, he never
[34:52] brought us a word. Amen. Just to show us
[34:54] where God was and what God did, but he's
[34:57] trying to show us what he's doing and
[34:58] where he's taking us.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; So, in Matthew chapter 1, it rehearses
[35:05] the the the uh the the prophecy out of
[35:08] Isaiah 7. It said, "Behold, a virgin
[35:11] shall be with child and shall bring
[35:12] forth a son, and they shall call his
[35:14] name Emmanuel, which being interpreted
[35:17] is God with us." So the super sign
[35:21] brought God into flesh and God in flesh
[35:25] was God with us. Before it was God above
[35:27] us, now it's God with us.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now again in 61 super sign says
[35:33] but he gave a super sign so that about
[35:37] one10enth of them would believe it. See
[35:40] see he gave a super sign but hardly any
[35:42] of them believed it.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; See what man calls great God calls
[35:47] foolish. And what man calls foolish God
[35:48] calls great. Now we cannot dispute
[35:51] Isaiah's uh Isaiah's word here. Then God
[35:54] said through Isaiah I will give them an
[35:56] everlasting sign. Everlasting. and a
[35:58] virgin shall conceive and shall bear a
[36:00] son and call his name Emanuel. I will be
[36:03] in him, God with us, a super sign. Not a
[36:06] polished scholar, but a super sign.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Now, let's go to John chapter 14
[36:11] together.
[36:30] John chapter 14
[36:33] verse 18.
[36:38] In verse 18 he says, "I will not leave
[36:40] you comfortless. I will come to you. Yet
[36:44] a little while and the world seeth me no
[36:46] more, but ye see me because I live ye
[36:48] shall live also. At that day you shall
[36:51] know that I am in my father and ye in me
[36:54] and I in you.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Brother M comes to verse 20 when he
[36:58] quotes it later in the ministry. He said
[37:00] at that day he said that's this day.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; When the revelation is made known it
[37:06] will be I'm in the father and ye in me
[37:08] and I in you. He that hath my
[37:11] commandments and keep them. He it is
[37:14] that loveth me, and he that loveth me
[37:16] shall be loved in my father, and I will
[37:18] love him, and will manifest myself to
[37:20] him. Verse 22, Judas saith unto him, not
[37:23] a scariot, Lord, how is it that thou
[37:26] wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not
[37:28] unto the world? Amen. This is the this
[37:32] is the this is the great mystery. Jesus
[37:34] says, I'm going to come to you,
[37:37] and if you keep my commandments, my
[37:39] father will love you, and I'll love you,
[37:40] and I'll manifest myself to you. And
[37:42] here he is. Here he is gone standing in
[37:45] flesh. Jesus Christ. A man that they
[37:48] touched, that they laid next to, that
[37:49] they fished with, that that they they've
[37:51] done all these things with. And this is
[37:52] how they know him. And he says, "How are
[37:55] you going to manifest yourself or reveal
[37:57] yourself to us and not to the world? If
[37:59] we see you, they'll see you. How is this
[38:01] all going to work?" And so now he comes
[38:02] and he tells him verse 23, Jesus
[38:04] answered and said unto him, "If a man
[38:06] love me, he will keep my words and my
[38:09] father will love him. And we," Remember
[38:12] we talked about this a couple services
[38:14] ago, "And we, who?" The father and the
[38:17] son. Is it two different people? No.
[38:20] He's telling you the fullness is going
[38:22] to be in you. Amen. The office of
[38:24] father, the office of son through the
[38:26] office of comforter or holy ghost is
[38:28] going to come into you.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; But man, love me. He will keep my words
[38:32] and my father will love him and we will
[38:34] come unto him and make our abode with
[38:37] him.
[38:39] How are you going to manifest yourself
[38:40] to us and not to the world? I mean, we
[38:43] can see you right here. You're manifest.
[38:44] The world sees you, too. They may
[38:46] reject, but how are you going to
[38:47] manifest yourself? Here's how I'm going
[38:49] to do it. Amen. I am going to come
[38:51] inside of you. That's how I'm going to
[38:52] manifest myself to you and reveal myself
[38:54] to you and dwell in you. And it's going
[38:56] to be once again God and flesh. The
[38:59] manifest myself in God and flesh, one
[39:01] man. But I'm going to manifest myself
[39:03] God and flesh, many members.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; That's how I'm going to reveal myself to
[39:08] you and not to the world.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; The world may see it and not understand
[39:13] it and pass by it and walk by it and
[39:15] ridicule it or ignore it or have nothing
[39:17] to do with it. Amen. But but to the
[39:19] believer, it's going to be a
[39:21] manifestation of God revealing himself
[39:23] again.
[39:24] Amen.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[39:28] He goes on and he says in super sign,
[39:30] the super sign, this is from 63. Now, oh
[39:33] God, if the world could only see that
[39:35] that God and man are one, the super sign
[39:38] was that first man that God could come
[39:40] into. All that God was, he poured into
[39:42] Christ. And all Christ was, he poured
[39:45] into the church. Super sign. God and man
[39:49] together. That was to be the super sign
[39:51] of the last day. So, so we got this uh
[39:56] God and man together that was to be the
[39:59] super sign of the last day when the
[40:00] entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the
[40:03] last day. A super sign. Now, he's not
[40:05] talking about Jesus's day. He's talking
[40:07] about our day. He's talking about a
[40:09] super sign in our day. The super sign in
[40:12] that day was God and man as one in the
[40:15] flesh of Jesus Christ. But now there's
[40:16] coming to another super sign in our day.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Now in the last day, a
[40:23] super sign, a virgin shall conceive, and
[40:25] this conception when it's brought forth
[40:27] will be God manifest in flesh, a super
[40:30] sign." They still don't believe it, but
[40:32] it was anyhow. It's still a super sign.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; And go to the next part of the quote.
[40:39] Notice super sign. They've got Superman
[40:41] today. They got fictions of Superman.
[40:43] All these other kind of super things.
[40:45] But the church has got a super sign. God
[40:48] back in the church manifested in human
[40:51] flesh.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Listen, the church in the end time
[40:54] received a a super sign. God united with
[40:57] man, his sure super sign. Notice the
[41:00] eternal sign, an unfailing sign. It will
[41:03] never fail. The word and man become one.
[41:06] When God's word and man become one, as
[41:08] St. John the first chapter said, in the
[41:09] beginning was the word and the word was
[41:11] with God and the word was God and the
[41:13] word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[41:15] That's the super sign.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, if that was the super sign of that
[41:20] day when the when the same spirit that
[41:23] was in Jesus Christ comes into the
[41:25] church to manifest the written word for
[41:26] the day, that's still the super sign.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we've seen a super sign
[41:34] back in the church today. Amen. And and
[41:36] and when you look at the ministry of
[41:39] brother Bam as Malachi 4. Amen. And he
[41:42] come on the scene to do what? He come to
[41:44] bring the revelation of the seventh seal
[41:46] for he was the messenger of the seventh
[41:48] seal and it was being revealed in him
[41:50] because now God had a vessel that he
[41:52] could work through and he worked through
[41:54] the vessel of William Brandham and as he
[41:56] did he did things that man can't do. He
[41:59] did things that only God can do. He did
[42:02] things that only Messiah could do. He
[42:04] did things that God did on the plains of
[42:06] memory when he visited Abraham at the
[42:08] time for the promise. when he stipped
[42:10] into fle flesh temporarily and had his
[42:13] back to the tent and told Sarah what she
[42:15] was thinking. Amen. In her heart in the
[42:17] tent behind him and discerning the
[42:18] thoughts of the heart. That was the sign
[42:19] of the Messiah. He did it thousands of
[42:22] years ago to Abraham. He did it when he
[42:24] came in the flesh of Jesus Christ. And
[42:26] when did he show that sign of the
[42:27] Messiah? When God came in flesh. He came
[42:29] in flesh on the plains of memory. He
[42:31] came in flesh. Amen. In Jesus' day, but
[42:34] in the end time at the opening of the
[42:35] seven seals. At the at the revealing of
[42:37] the seventh seal, he came in flesh again
[42:40] in the ministry of William Brandham and
[42:42] turned his back to a crowd and showed
[42:44] the sign of the Messiah.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; A super sign. God and man connected
[42:50] together displaying the word for our
[42:52] hour.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; We don't leave the super sign thousands
[42:56] of years ago. But friends, I'm not even
[42:58] going to leave the super sign 50, 60
[43:00] years ago
[43:02] &gt;&gt; because that sign was for a purpose to
[43:04] show us something to build our faith to
[43:06] give us confidence to positionally place
[43:08] us to open our eyes.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; When the same spirit that was on Jesus
[43:14] Christ comes into his church to manifest
[43:15] the written word for today, that is
[43:17] still the super sign.
[43:20] Amen.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Again, he says, "But look, right at the
[43:22] end time before the burning and the
[43:24] destroying, the super sign appears
[43:26] mysteriously." What is this? This is
[43:28] brother Brandham's ministry.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; The super sign appears mysteriously
[43:33] right on the scene again before us.
[43:35] Amen. God himself.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; You got it.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Not a man.
[43:43] But God made manifest a super sign and
[43:46] an everlasting sign, an eternal sign, a
[43:50] super sign, God manifested in the flesh.
[43:53] Same sign that his son did. His super
[43:55] son promised the same at the end. As it
[43:58] was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be
[44:00] at the coming of the son of man. The
[44:02] days of Sodom, the the visitation of God
[44:05] to Abraham on the plains of Mamry. Amen.
[44:07] Jesus Christ pointed to it and he says,
[44:09] "As it was then, it will be at the
[44:11] return of the son of man, at the
[44:12] revealing of the son of man." Amen. When
[44:14] I come back to you, Amen. You're going
[44:16] to see the same thing that you saw in
[44:18] the days of Sodom. And friends, we've
[44:20] seen it.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; We witnessed in this generation a super
[44:24] sign. Not just 2,000 years ago, a super
[44:26] sign, but in this generation, a super
[44:29] sign.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; God manifest in the flesh. Amen. Brother
[44:32] Brandon was told by by God, God came to
[44:35] him, amen, through an angel and began to
[44:37] speak to him and tell him, amen, as he
[44:39] was sitting against a tree, pondering
[44:41] the scripture that we read last service
[44:44] about if you say unto this mountain, be
[44:46] plucked up and cast into the sea, and
[44:48] doubt not in your heart. And as he's
[44:49] pondering this, brother Bram said, I
[44:51] never understood it. I never preached
[44:53] it. And all of a sudden, God came to him
[44:55] and began to speak to him.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; And he began to tell him that you can do
[45:00] that. Yes.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; And he began to encourage him to speak
[45:04] and and he says, "Well, what will I
[45:05] say?" And he says, "Well, you're
[45:06] hunting. You have no squirrels and you
[45:08] need squirrels." And so he was moving
[45:10] him by leadership. Amen. And and he was
[45:12] beginning to display what? And you know
[45:14] when brother Brandham then began to
[45:16] speak, Amen. He said, "There'll come a
[45:18] squirrel from here to there and here to
[45:20] there and appear over here." And
[45:21] whatever he said is exactly what
[45:24] happened. Amen. And brother Brandham
[45:26] never took credit for creating squirrels
[45:30] &gt;&gt; because he in himself as a human being
[45:33] born of a man and woman could not create
[45:35] squirrels. But it was God working in
[45:38] that flesh. And when he spoke by the
[45:40] command and direction of God, brother
[45:42] Benham said it's the same as deity
[45:44] speaking.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; It came into existence because God and
[45:49] God was manifesting the super sign
[45:52] again. God and man connected as one. a
[45:54] vessel that he had control of that he
[45:56] could work through.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; And then brother Bam tells us,
[46:02] listen, not even Jesus did that sign.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; He said because Jesus took bread that
[46:09] was already baked and made more.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; But this was creating out of nothing
[46:15] just by the spoken word. And brother
[46:17] Brandham connected it right back to
[46:19] Genesis 1 that God created everything by
[46:22] the spoken word. And it was the same
[46:24] life, the same power, the same God that
[46:27] spoke the world into existence was the
[46:29] same God through a vessel of clay that
[46:31] spoke squirrels into existence.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; It was a super sign.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; It was a super sign.
[46:40] Listen, that super sign came for a
[46:42] reason.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; We talked about this last week. It
[46:48] didn't come for squirrels
[46:52] &gt;&gt; because those squirrels were created,
[46:54] lived a few seconds or few minutes, were
[46:56] shot and were put in a pot and were
[46:58] eaten.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; So that manifestation wasn't for the
[47:02] squirrels.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; That manifestation was for you and I.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; He said God manifest in the flesh. Same
[47:12] sign that his son did. His super son
[47:15] promised the same at the end as it was
[47:17] in the days of Sodom. So shall it be at
[47:19] the coming of the son of man. The super
[47:21] sign will return. We've had all these
[47:24] other things. The path of Abraham's
[47:26] royal seed has come up. The same path
[47:28] that Abraham came up. But just before
[47:31] the destroying of the world, the super
[47:33] sign must appear again. an eternal
[47:36] everlasting resurrection sign that
[47:38] proves that the royal seed could not be
[47:41] killed like Daniel and like the rest of
[47:43] the prophets was. The grave couldn't
[47:45] hold him because the others conquered
[47:47] the gates of the enemy such as fire and
[47:50] lion and sword and so forth. They
[47:52] conquered that. But this royal seed
[47:55] conquered death, hell, and the grave.
[47:57] Nothing could hold him. Why? He's an
[47:59] everlasting super sign.
[48:02] Continuing on, what is a super sign? The
[48:06] resurrection of Jesus Christ. So, not
[48:08] only is the super sign, Amen. God and
[48:11] man is one, but the super sign is also
[48:13] the resurrection. Amen. Because they
[48:16] couldn't hold him in the grave. He
[48:17] overcame death hell in the grave. What
[48:20] is the super sign? The resurrection of
[48:22] Jesus Christ. After being dead for 2,000
[48:24] years, I thought he was dead.
[48:28] I thought he only laid dead for two,
[48:30] three days.
[48:32] What's he talking about now? Which
[48:35] resurrection is he talking about now?
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; The resurrection of Jesus Christ after
[48:40] being dead for 2,000 years still stands
[48:42] in the midst of us the same as he did
[48:44] then. Manifesting himself in his church.
[48:47] In human flesh. How's he manifesting
[48:50] himself in the church? In human flesh.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; We all seen it. We hear the testimonies.
[48:56] We hear it on tapes. Amen. We've we've
[48:58] heard about it. That was gone. Christ
[49:00] manifesting himself in flesh. He's the
[49:02] same yesterday, today, and forever. A
[49:05] virgin shall conceive. And from that
[49:06] time, God and man will be one, united
[49:09] together. An everlasting eternal sign, a
[49:12] super sign. Then he then he starts
[49:13] singing this song. He lives. He lives.
[49:16] Christ Jesus lives today. You ask me how
[49:18] I know he lives. He lives within my
[49:21] heart. I listen. I see him among us. All
[49:25] of his elected seed will see it. Amen.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; How will you manifest yourself to us and
[49:32] not to the world? Amen. Because my
[49:34] father and I, if you keep the
[49:35] commandments, if you receive the word,
[49:37] if you believe all of the word and
[49:39] everything and the restoration of the
[49:41] word at the end time, if you believe
[49:43] this word and keep the commandments, I
[49:45] will love you. My father will love you
[49:46] and we will come into you and make our
[49:48] abode. How are you going to reveal
[49:50] yourself to us and not them? This is how
[49:52] I'm going to reveal myself to you. By
[49:54] coming into the church.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:59] And brother said, "I see him among us. I
[50:01] see it, too." Said, "All of his elected
[50:03] seed will see it."
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:08] Let's go to Exodus together.
[50:11] We read this recently,
[50:14] but I'm going to read this and then jump
[50:15] to another scripture.
[50:18] Exodus chapter 19, starting at verse
[50:22] three.
[50:28] God had sent a mighty sign down to to
[50:32] Egypt to free his his children and and
[50:34] for them to to confirm the time of the
[50:37] promise and confirm the the coming of
[50:39] the deliverer which the deliverer was
[50:41] Jesus Christ. It was God. It was it was
[50:44] God himself coming down to deliver. He
[50:46] said, "I have come down to deliver my
[50:48] people. Now, Moses, I send you." So
[50:50] Moses played the role of deliverer, but
[50:52] the deliverer was the life of God inside
[50:54] Moses.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; So you can say Moses was the deliverer.
[50:58] That's true because he was playing, he
[51:00] was the flesh man that was playing the
[51:01] role of deliverer, but the real
[51:03] deliverer was the life inside.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so so now he comes down and
[51:09] God shows a mighty sign and all that he
[51:12] does through Moses. He shows that God
[51:14] and man are working together in
[51:16] partnership and he's working through
[51:17] Moses. And Moses does things no man can
[51:19] do. Amen. He speaks flies and flies come
[51:22] and frogs and and all the plagues that
[51:24] fall. He starts doing miraculous things
[51:26] as a sign. And he he was a sign to them.
[51:30] But but that sign had a purpose.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; And we talked about this before, but
[51:35] we'll do it again. Exodus 19 and3 he
[51:38] says and Moses went up unto God and the
[51:40] Lord called unto him out of the mountain
[51:42] saying thus shalt thou say to the house
[51:44] of Jacob and tell the children of Israel
[51:46] you have seen what I did unto the
[51:47] Egyptians and how I bore you on eagle's
[51:50] wings and brought you unto myself. Now
[51:53] therefore, if you will obey my voice
[51:55] indeed, and keep my covenant, then you
[51:57] shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[52:00] above all the people for uh above all
[52:03] people, for all the earth is mine, and
[52:05] you shall be unto me a kingdom of
[52:08] priests and a holy nation. These are the
[52:11] words which thou shalt speak unto the
[52:13] children of Israel. So God sent a sign,
[52:16] a major sign, a prophetic sign to show
[52:20] that this is the time of deliverance,
[52:22] that the deliverer has come. And Moses
[52:24] was showing that the deliverer was on
[52:25] the scene. And through that vessel, God
[52:28] is delivering his people. But he did it
[52:30] for a purpose. And the purpose was the
[52:32] fulfillment of the prophecy that God was
[52:35] going to take the children, the seed of
[52:37] Abraham, and put them in the word,
[52:40] &gt;&gt; in their land.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. and that those people would be a
[52:45] kingdom full of priests and a holy
[52:47] nation and a peculiar people.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; The sign was not just so you could say
[52:52] Moses is great. Moses amazing and God
[52:54] did amazing things through Moses, but
[52:56] the sign came to bring a deliverance to
[52:58] bring you out to to take them in so that
[53:01] they would be positionally placed in
[53:03] their position in the word.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; We're together.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Now, let's turn to uh First Peter. pull
[53:11] the scripture up here. First Peter
[53:14] chapter 2.
[53:29] Amen. I love having the PowerPoint up
[53:31] here, but it sounds so good to hear the
[53:34] pages of the Bible turn.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; There's something about the word of God.
[53:39] Amen. and looking into it that I like.
[53:42] All right. First Peter chapter 2. I got
[53:46] to find it. Sorry, I'm talking and I
[53:48] can't even turn my Bible fast enough. 1
[53:51] Peter chapter 2 verse 5.
[53:55] Ye also as lively stones are built up a
[53:58] spiritual house, a holy priesthood to
[54:01] offer spiritual sacrifice acceptable to
[54:03] God by Jesus Christ. Wherefore also it
[54:07] is contained in the scripture, behold, I
[54:08] lay in Zion a chief cornerstone elected
[54:11] precious, and he that believeth on him
[54:13] shall not be confounded. Unto you
[54:15] therefore, which believe he is precious,
[54:17] but unto them which be disobedient, the
[54:19] stone which the builders disallowed, the
[54:21] same is made the head of the corner, and
[54:23] a stone of stumbling, and a rock of
[54:25] offense, even to them which stumble at
[54:28] the word, being disobedient, wherein to
[54:30] also they were appointed. But ye are a
[54:34] chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a
[54:37] holy nation, a peculiar people, that you
[54:39] should show forth the praises of him who
[54:42] hath called you out of darkness into his
[54:44] marvelous light, which in time past were
[54:46] not a people, but are now the people of
[54:48] God, which had not obtained mercy, but
[54:51] now have obtained mercy.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; So here he is taking this this word and
[54:57] he's preaching, amen, to Gentiles. He
[54:59] said, you who were not a people are now
[55:01] a people. Amen. people who didn't know
[55:03] the Old Testament, people who didn't
[55:05] know Moses ministry, and now he's coming
[55:07] and he's showing what Jesus Christ did.
[55:09] There was a super sign to bring
[55:11] deliverance in their day that he says,
[55:13] "But God has called you to be a peculiar
[55:16] people."
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "You are lively stones." Back
[55:20] in verse five, you are lively. That
[55:22] means living.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; You are living stones. You this this is
[55:27] not a dead building. This is not dead
[55:29] stone building, but you are living
[55:31] stones. And stone in the Bible is a
[55:33] revelation and a revelation. And to us,
[55:35] it's a confession of our revelation. But
[55:37] the stone is a is is a revelation. And
[55:40] you are a living revelation. Amen. Built
[55:43] together to be a spiritual house.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; A spiritual house. Listen, that means
[55:49] really the church of God has nothing to
[55:50] do with the mortar, the brick, the
[55:52] stone, the metal, the carpet, everything
[55:54] you see around you. It is a spiritual
[55:56] house. Amen. It's through the individual
[55:59] built as a living stone. and all of the
[56:01] living revelations of God. Amen. Brought
[56:03] together to be a house that he's
[56:05] dwelling in.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; A a holy priesthood.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. To offer spiritual sacrifices
[56:16] acceptable to God. And I was to go back
[56:19] to verse 9 again. But you are a chosen
[56:22] generation.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; You are predestinated to this position.
[56:28] You are a chosen generation.
[56:30] a royal priesthood,
[56:33] a holy nation, a peculiar people, that
[56:37] you should show forth the praises of him
[56:39] that hath called you out of darkness
[56:41] into the marvelous light.
[56:44] We are called and positionally placed to
[56:47] show forth his praises, his life, his
[56:50] glory.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. I thank God for his positional
[56:56] placing.
[56:59] Every time this sign came, this great
[57:02] prophetic sign. Amen. God was trying to
[57:04] bring his people into their position or
[57:06] bring them back to their position.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Over and over again. Let's turn now to
[57:12] Revelation chapter 1.
[57:20] Revelation chapter 1.
[57:22] We're going to go to verse four.
[57:34] John to the seven churches which are in
[57:35] Asia. Grace be unto you and peace from
[57:37] him which is and which was and which is
[57:40] to come. And from the seven spirits
[57:42] which are before his throne. and from
[57:44] Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness
[57:46] and the first begotten of the dead and
[57:49] the prince of the kings of the earth
[57:51] unto him that loved us and washed us
[57:53] from our sins in his own blood and hath
[57:56] made us hath
[57:59] &gt;&gt; past tense
[58:01] &gt;&gt; hath made us kings and priests unto God
[58:03] his father to him be glory and dominion
[58:06] forever and ever.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Has he made you that? Yes.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother BM goes through this in
[58:15] the church age book and he takes this
[58:17] same scripture. He hath made us kings
[58:19] and priests and to God and his father.
[58:21] To him be glory and dominion forever and
[58:23] ever. Amen. He hath made us whole. There
[58:25] are certain truths we need to emphasize.
[58:27] So let's go ahead and emphasize it.
[58:30] This is one of them. He He hath made us.
[58:35] Salvation is his doing. Salvation is of
[58:37] the Lord. All of his grace. He redeemed
[58:40] us for a purpose. He bought us for a
[58:43] purpose. We are kings, spiritual kings.
[58:46] Oh, we are going to be kings upon the
[58:48] earth with him when he sits on his
[58:49] throne. But now we are spiritual kings
[58:52] and we reign over a spiritual kingdom.
[58:55] It says in Romans 5:17, "For if by one
[58:58] man's offense death reigned by one, much
[59:00] more they which receive abundance of
[59:02] grace and the gift of of righteousness
[59:03] shall reign in life by one, Jesus
[59:06] Christ."
[59:07] Then he goes on to the next Colossians
[59:10] 1:13. Who hath delivered us from the
[59:12] power of darkness and hath translated us
[59:14] into the kingdom, the reign of his dear
[59:16] son.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Right now we reign with Christ, having
[59:20] dominion over sin, the world, the flesh,
[59:24] and the devil.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; So what do we have dominion over? The
[59:28] sin, the world, the flesh, and the
[59:31] devil. Amen. What is it that's
[59:33] challenging you in your life? What is it
[59:35] that's trying to overcome you in your
[59:36] life? Amen. What is it that's trying to
[59:38] disrupt you? Amen. Don't worry about
[59:40] what's going on with the neighbors. And
[59:42] don't worry about going on in politics.
[59:43] Don't worry about all that. Amen. There
[59:45] there's been there there's the the sin
[59:47] and the world. Amen. Which is unbelief
[59:50] in the world, the spirit of the world
[59:51] and the flesh, the flesh you live in,
[59:53] and the devil. They're all working
[59:55] together to try to derail you, to try to
[59:58] stop you. But praise God, we are
[1:00:01] spiritual kings reigning over those
[1:00:03] things.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; We reign over unbelief. Unbelief can't
[1:00:07] reign over us. We reign over unbelief.
[1:00:10] Amen. The world can't reign over us, but
[1:00:12] that worldly spirit has to come under
[1:00:14] our dominion. Amen. Amen. The flesh that
[1:00:17] I live in that's trying to derail me all
[1:00:19] the time. This flesh I have dominion
[1:00:22] over because I have spiritual authority
[1:00:25] as a king to tell the flesh no.
[1:00:29] Amen.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't have to let sin I don't
[1:00:34] have to let the lust of the flesh I
[1:00:36] don't have to let it rule me. It doesn't
[1:00:38] matter how strong the temptation. It
[1:00:40] doesn't matter how many times it comes.
[1:00:42] Amen. If I find myself a slave to
[1:00:44] temptation, then I don't understand who
[1:00:46] I am in Christ. I don't understand my
[1:00:48] God-given position, authority, and
[1:00:50] rights as a spiritual king, kings and
[1:00:52] priests because he has already made me
[1:00:54] that. Amen.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; I don't have to say yes to the flesh. I
[1:00:59] can tell the flesh no. And I can bring
[1:01:01] the flesh subject to my dominion as a
[1:01:04] spiritual king.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; The same thing to the devil. I don't
[1:01:09] have to give the devil access to me.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; He has no rights. Amen. He because I'm a
[1:01:17] spiritual king and I have authority over
[1:01:20] unbelief, over the worldly spirit, over
[1:01:22] my own flesh, and over the devil. He can
[1:01:24] only come and take advantage of me if I
[1:01:27] give him permission to. That's right.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; He can only come and begin to derail my
[1:01:32] life and bring deception into me is if I
[1:01:34] open the door because I'm the king.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right now we reign. Right now.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; We reign with Christ having dominion
[1:01:47] over sin, the world, the flesh, and the
[1:01:50] devil. Showing forth his praise and
[1:01:52] glory. showing forth himself
[1:01:56] for it is Christ in us.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; This is why we're spiritual kings.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Because the king is living in us
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; because we're children of the king.
[1:02:08] Because that seed gain's been quickened
[1:02:10] to life, which is part of himself. And
[1:02:11] now his life is here anointing it,
[1:02:13] growing it to take dominion.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Showing forth himself. For it is Christ
[1:02:19] in us, willing and doing of his good
[1:02:21] pleasure. Yes indeed, even now we are
[1:02:23] seated in heavenly places in Christ
[1:02:25] Jesus
[1:02:27] and made us priests.
[1:02:30] Yes, priests unto him, offering the
[1:02:32] spiritual praise of sanctified lips,
[1:02:34] spending our lives as a sweet offering
[1:02:37] unto him.
[1:02:39] Worshiping him in spirit and in truth,
[1:02:42] interceding and petitioning, priests and
[1:02:45] kings unto our God. No wonder the world
[1:02:48] does not appeal to us. And we are a
[1:02:49] peculiar people, zealous unto good
[1:02:51] works. We have been recreated in him to
[1:02:54] be children like unto our father.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so glad for the recreated.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Not what I was, but he's I've been born
[1:03:03] again by the grace of God.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to look at this back uh this
[1:03:08] last paragraph a little more slowly. We
[1:03:11] are priests unto him offering spiritual
[1:03:15] praise of sanctified lips. Amen. So the
[1:03:19] priest in the Old Testament did many
[1:03:21] things. One of the duties of the priest
[1:03:23] was to sing praises and glorify the name
[1:03:26] of God. And that's part of what we're
[1:03:28] here to do. We are priests unto him.
[1:03:30] Amen. We are uh uh priests unto him
[1:03:33] offering the spiritual praise of
[1:03:35] sanctified lips. We're here to sing of
[1:03:37] his glory.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't come to church to hear
[1:03:40] the song leader sing. We come to church
[1:03:42] to sing with our own sanctified lips.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Praises unto his name.
[1:03:48] spending our lives as a sweet offering
[1:03:51] unto him.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; So what is our offering? What is our
[1:03:56] sacrifice? What is our gift that we
[1:03:58] bring? It's ourselves.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; It's our lives.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Worshiping him in spirit and in truth.
[1:04:07] Interceding and petitioning.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Another part of what the the priest's
[1:04:13] job was to do was to intercede for the
[1:04:15] sins of others. and to petition God on
[1:04:19] behalf of the nation of Israel. And God,
[1:04:22] because he's called us into this
[1:04:24] position, we're here to be priests unto
[1:04:26] him, to offer praises unto him. We're
[1:04:30] here to worship him in spirit and truth.
[1:04:32] We're here to offer him a gift of our
[1:04:34] lives as a sweet offering unto him. But
[1:04:38] we're also here to intercede in petition
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; for one another, for those that are
[1:04:44] around us. Amen. We can't forget that
[1:04:46] we're not just here to sing his praises
[1:04:48] and declare his truth. We're here to
[1:04:49] intercede and petition.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; I'm not I don't have time to go into
[1:04:54] that. I got to go into another area. But
[1:04:56] I just want to labor on that for a
[1:04:57] minute and leave that here. Amen.
[1:04:59] Whatever you're seeing going wrong,
[1:05:01] there's a reason you're seeing it.
[1:05:02] Whenever you see a need in a brother,
[1:05:04] sister, a co-orker, a family member,
[1:05:06] Amen. Don't forget that you are now a
[1:05:09] king and priest by the grace of God, by
[1:05:12] the new birth, and you've been put into
[1:05:13] a position. And who can intercede for
[1:05:16] that need but you?
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; In the message perseverant, he says,
[1:05:26] "Now we believe the Bible to be God's
[1:05:28] infallible word. We believe that it is
[1:05:32] the entire revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:05:34] revealing himself in the Old Testament
[1:05:35] by the prophets. God making himself
[1:05:37] known through his son Christ Jesus. And
[1:05:39] in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead
[1:05:41] bodily. He was crucified for our sins.
[1:05:44] Died, buried, rose the third day,
[1:05:45] ascended into heaven, and is back here
[1:05:47] again in in the name of in the form of
[1:05:50] the Holy Spirit. God dwelling. One time
[1:05:53] God above us in Christ, God with us.
[1:05:56] Now, God in us. It's God working his way
[1:06:00] back into man to worship, to be
[1:06:04] worshiped through man. God's agency. God
[1:06:07] does nothing outside of man being his
[1:06:09] agent, his helper. I love this. The
[1:06:12] whole plan of God, God above us, God
[1:06:15] with us, God in us is God working his
[1:06:19] way back into man again.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; That's what he wants in this hour.
[1:06:23] Friends, the second fold of the
[1:06:25] three-fold purpose is that he'll have
[1:06:26] preeminence. That he'll be back in us
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; as king.
[1:06:34] And the message influence he says we've
[1:06:35] got to have him for he is life and he
[1:06:38] alone not to know his book not to know
[1:06:41] this or to know that or know the creed
[1:06:43] but to know him is life now know him as
[1:06:46] a person Christ in you the word made
[1:06:49] flesh in you that's knowing him
[1:06:52] when he you and he become becomes one
[1:06:55] like I said last night in the super sign
[1:06:58] he has got to come in you God and man
[1:07:01] must become one. Amen.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham makes this
[1:07:05] statement and and I want to break it
[1:07:07] down the way it hit me. He says, "Not to
[1:07:10] know his book is not to know him." Just
[1:07:14] to be able to read, just to be able to
[1:07:15] to agree with and and read the Bible and
[1:07:18] say, "Yeah, that's right." That's not
[1:07:19] necessarily knowing him and not to know
[1:07:22] this or to know that or to know the
[1:07:23] creed, but to know him as life. Amen.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Knowing him as the person,
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Christ in you, the word made flesh in
[1:07:33] you. That's knowing him.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; So you can't even say, "Well, I know
[1:07:38] him." Because brother Brandham said, "I
[1:07:39] know him." No, no. To know him is
[1:07:42] personal. To know him is to know the
[1:07:44] person Christ in you. Amen. Manifesting
[1:07:47] through your flesh. That's knowing him.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; That's the knowing him I want to know.
[1:07:53] Amen. not knowing facts about him or
[1:07:55] details about him. But I want that
[1:07:57] personal knowledge of him and I becoming
[1:07:59] one and him taking the rulership in my
[1:08:02] life and his spirit leading through me,
[1:08:04] manifesting his word through my flesh.
[1:08:06] Amen. Overcoming things I couldn't
[1:08:07] overcome before. Amen. Changing things
[1:08:09] in my life I couldn't change before.
[1:08:11] Bringing me to a greater manifestation
[1:08:13] of his word. That's knowing him. And
[1:08:15] that's the knowing him I want to know.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. In Colossians, he says, "Even
[1:08:22] the mystery which has been hid from ages
[1:08:23] and from generations, but now is made
[1:08:25] manifest to his saints, to whom God
[1:08:27] would make known what is the riches of
[1:08:29] the glory of this mystery among the
[1:08:30] Gentiles, which is Christ in you,
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; the hope of glory."
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:08:40] We believe it was Christ and brother
[1:08:43] Brandham, but now the mystery among the
[1:08:45] Gentiles is Christ in you.
[1:08:48] This becomes such a personal revelation.
[1:08:50] This is not a group revelation. It's a
[1:08:53] personal revelation.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; And Christ is the mystery of God
[1:08:58] revealed. He says, "Listen, listen close
[1:08:59] now. I want you not to fail to get this.
[1:09:02] No other church, no other sign, no other
[1:09:05] fellowship, no other government, no
[1:09:07] other testimony, no other creed, no
[1:09:10] denomination is accepted outside of
[1:09:13] this. God accepts nothing else but that.
[1:09:16] Christ in you, the hope of glory. The
[1:09:19] only thing that God recognizes.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; No fellowship, no church, no creed, no
[1:09:25] denomination, no nothing. Everything
[1:09:28] else is dead. It's fragments that has to
[1:09:31] be cut off, pruned off away from the
[1:09:33] thing that Christ might live with
[1:09:35] preeminence in you.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. I You know what? I thank
[1:09:40] God for a fellowship like we have a
[1:09:42] group of believers that can come
[1:09:44] together like-minded in fellowship and
[1:09:46] love the same things. But my my
[1:09:48] association with the group is not what
[1:09:51] he's looking for and not what he
[1:09:52] accepts. My identification verbally with
[1:09:55] the message saying I believe brothers a
[1:09:56] prophet I believe the message that's not
[1:09:58] what he accepts. There's only one thing
[1:10:00] that he accepts. And what he accepts is
[1:10:03] God accepts nothing else but that.
[1:10:05] Christ in you, the hope of glory. That
[1:10:07] Christ himself has entered in and taken
[1:10:10] dominion and brought a new birth. Amen.
[1:10:12] By his personal presence in our lives.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that God will
[1:10:17] recognize.
[1:10:19] Amen.
[1:10:20] Then that's his goal for this hour.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. to have his people in this kind of
[1:10:25] relationship.
[1:10:28] Again, in Christ is the mystery. He says
[1:10:30] his presence in the individual with a
[1:10:32] personal vindication of himself
[1:10:34] expressing himself, the living word
[1:10:37] that's promised for the day expressing
[1:10:39] itself through you. A vindication of the
[1:10:42] great revelation of God. Look, only in
[1:10:45] an individual,
[1:10:47] never in a group. You got that?
[1:10:50] I know you got it because we've read it
[1:10:52] before, but I can't labor on it enough,
[1:10:54] friends, because this has to be
[1:10:56] something that is real with me in
[1:10:59] Christ.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; An individual, not in a group. His
[1:11:04] identification is with an individual.
[1:11:06] You get that? Not with the Methodist,
[1:11:08] not with the Baptist, not the
[1:11:09] Presbyterian, not the Luther, not the
[1:11:11] Pentecostals, but as an individual. I'll
[1:11:14] take one and leave one. I'll separate
[1:11:15] them. That's right. There'll be two in
[1:11:17] the field. I'll take one, leave one.
[1:11:18] There'll be two in the bed. I'll take
[1:11:20] one, leave one. It's not a group. It is
[1:11:23] a personal vindication of a pregnantated
[1:11:25] child of God filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:11:28] so surrendered to God that he don't care
[1:11:30] about.
[1:11:32] Can I can I highlight this?
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; This is the key, friends.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; This is one of the great keys
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; we're talking about. so surrendered to
[1:11:48] God that he don't care about anything
[1:11:49] else.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Listen, we we've got families. We've got
[1:11:55] jobs. We've got responsibilities. God
[1:11:57] put us on earth to live a human life on
[1:11:59] earth.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Listen, don't be mistaken. He wants you
[1:12:01] to go work.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; He wants you to interact with people at
[1:12:04] work. He wants you to interact in the
[1:12:06] community. He wants you to interact with
[1:12:07] family. God wants you to live a human
[1:12:09] life. He wants you to do things that
[1:12:11] human do. He wants you to cook food. He
[1:12:12] wants you to go take walks. He wants you
[1:12:14] to enjoy flowers. He wants you to smell
[1:12:16] the roses.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; He created them for all of that.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; But there's got to come one thing that
[1:12:23] becomes our primary goal. And there's
[1:12:25] only one thing that we truly care about.
[1:12:27] And that is that's so surrendered to God
[1:12:30] that you don't care about anything else
[1:12:32] but God.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. and the Holy Spirit living its
[1:12:37] life, pulsating through him, showing the
[1:12:40] personal vindication of the word itself,
[1:12:42] expressing itself to the people and to
[1:12:44] the world. That's what God wants to do
[1:12:46] with this individual relationship. He
[1:12:47] wants to manifest himself in us.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to be so surrendered to
[1:12:54] that life of God that I don't care about
[1:12:56] anything else but God. And it's not that
[1:12:57] I won't care. Listen, brother Bam says
[1:12:59] to the individual. Never a group. Never
[1:13:02] a group. To the individual, not my
[1:13:03] church. My church has nothing to do
[1:13:05] with. Listen, when I say that, I I I
[1:13:07] mean, I I know that you I trust that you
[1:13:09] know, and we're all believers. We know
[1:13:11] that when I come to this relationship
[1:13:13] with Christ, it doesn't mean that I'm
[1:13:15] not going to go to church anymore.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Because it's the No, I think this kind
[1:13:19] of relationship makes you the most
[1:13:21] faithful to church. Amen. Because
[1:13:22] brother Bam said, "If God lives in your
[1:13:24] heart, you can't wait for them doors to
[1:13:25] open to get in there and fellowship with
[1:13:26] your brothers." So, this kind of
[1:13:28] relationship doesn't drive you off into
[1:13:30] isolation and cause you to leave parts
[1:13:32] of the word. Amen. No, it's not. It's
[1:13:34] not it at all. But just coming to church
[1:13:36] isn't enough. Just being part of the
[1:13:38] group isn't enough. Just being
[1:13:40] identified with isn't enough. It's got
[1:13:42] to be individual with you in Christ. But
[1:13:44] if it's individual with you in Christ,
[1:13:46] then it'll be really good with you and
[1:13:48] everybody else.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when I say don't care about
[1:13:54] anything else, it doesn't mean you give
[1:13:55] up on your family. You stop talking to
[1:13:57] your kids and and you go off and live as
[1:13:59] a monk somewhere in the world cuz I
[1:14:00] don't care. I don't want to. No, it
[1:14:02] means everything else is secondary. That
[1:14:04] is this. This is primary. This is the
[1:14:06] greatest care of my life. And then when
[1:14:08] I'm interacting with others and when I'm
[1:14:10] living a life, when I'm taking a walk
[1:14:11] and I feel the sunshine, all I'm
[1:14:13] thinking about is God who created the
[1:14:15] sun. When I smell the flowers, I'm
[1:14:16] thinking about God who created that
[1:14:17] flower. When I see my children, I'm
[1:14:19] thanking God for life. And I'm looking
[1:14:20] at a family. And I'm recognizing this is
[1:14:22] what God's wanting to do on the earth is
[1:14:24] be a family.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Everything else is secondary. And my
[1:14:28] whole focus is God.
[1:14:31] That's where we've got to be, friends.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the rapture message, I want to
[1:14:37] I want to talk about this now. I want to
[1:14:40] close out talking about this, but I'm
[1:14:41] not closing out.
[1:14:44] We're all together, right? I don't want
[1:14:46] to I don't want to falsely represent
[1:14:48] anything, but I want to turn and I want
[1:14:51] to finish out with this discussion on
[1:14:52] the rapture.
[1:14:54] said, 'There the message calls the bride
[1:14:56] together, see the shout and the trumpet.
[1:14:59] The same one he with a loud voice he
[1:15:01] screamed out with that shout uh with
[1:15:04] shout and a voice and woke Lazarus with
[1:15:07] a loud voice he cried, "Lazarus, come
[1:15:08] forth." And the voice wakes up wakes up
[1:15:10] the sleeping bride, the sleeping dead.
[1:15:13] And the trumpet with the sound of a
[1:15:14] trumpet and when it does, it calls
[1:15:16] always a trumpet calls Israel to the
[1:15:18] feast of trumpet sea which was a
[1:15:20] Pentecostal feast, the great feast in
[1:15:22] the sky. and the feast of the trumpets.
[1:15:24] Now, a trumpet uh does announce a
[1:15:27] calling together. Come to the feast. And
[1:15:29] now that is the lamb's supper in the
[1:15:32] sky. Now, watch the assembling together
[1:15:34] and the bride, the feast of the
[1:15:35] trumpets, the wedding supper. Brother
[1:15:37] Random, when he comes to preach this the
[1:15:39] the the rapture, he goes to First
[1:15:42] Thessalonians. Let's read this together.
[1:15:43] 1 Thessalonians 4:15.
[1:15:46] He says, "For this this we say unto you
[1:15:49] by the word of the Lord, that we which
[1:15:51] are alive and remain unto the coming of
[1:15:52] the Lord shall not prevent them which
[1:15:54] are asleep. For the Lord himself shall
[1:15:57] descend from heaven with a shout and
[1:15:59] with the voice of the archangel, and
[1:16:01] with the trump of God, and the dead in
[1:16:03] Christ shall rise first, and we which
[1:16:05] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:16:06] together with them in the clouds to meet
[1:16:08] the Lord in the air. And so shall we
[1:16:10] ever be with the Lord."
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother comes to this scripture
[1:16:14] and he shows that the rapture takes
[1:16:17] place in three phases or three parts.
[1:16:19] And first it's a shout then a voice and
[1:16:22] then the trump. And he says the shout is
[1:16:25] the message, amen, that goes out that
[1:16:27] gathers the bride together. And he said
[1:16:30] the voice will be the voice of the
[1:16:31] resurrection. He said it's the same
[1:16:32] voice that cried to Lazarus that brought
[1:16:34] him out of the ground. It's the same
[1:16:35] voice that'll bring forth the sleeping
[1:16:37] saints. Amen. Then there'll be a
[1:16:39] resurrection and then the trump will be
[1:16:41] the gathering to the marriage supper.
[1:16:44] So So the shout gathers the the bride
[1:16:47] together. The voice brings the
[1:16:49] resurrection of the sleeping saints and
[1:16:51] the trump changes our Adams and brings
[1:16:53] us all into the in the married supper.
[1:16:58] So we just want to talk about that. Says
[1:17:01] I wonder could it be already passed?
[1:17:04] Brother Benham in the rapture, he just
[1:17:05] got done talking about the experience he
[1:17:08] had of the preview of the bride when he
[1:17:10] saw the first church go by all in order
[1:17:13] marching and then he saw the modern
[1:17:15] church go by and he says it was a bunch
[1:17:17] of strip teases and it broke his heart
[1:17:18] and he said, "Oh God, of all the
[1:17:20] laboring we've done and this is the best
[1:17:21] we can do and his heart was just
[1:17:23] broken." But then as he's sitting there
[1:17:25] with a broken heart, he hears onward
[1:17:27] Christian soldiers and he looks again
[1:17:29] and he sees a church just like the first
[1:17:31] church coming through again for preview.
[1:17:34] And then in the end he at the end of the
[1:17:36] line he sees two getting out of step and
[1:17:38] he and he starts hollering out get back
[1:17:39] in step and he comes back to himself
[1:17:42] amen hollering get back in step and
[1:17:45] that's where he says wonder could it be
[1:17:47] already passed
[1:17:50] could the bride already be called? Is
[1:17:52] that what we're going through today? She
[1:17:55] has to be molded and made into the image
[1:17:57] of Christ and Christ is the word. Now,
[1:18:00] Brother Bram's asking the question, I'm
[1:18:02] going to black out.
[1:18:05] It's because you read ahead. If we have
[1:18:07] any visitors, I'm sorry, but we have a
[1:18:09] very unruly assembly
[1:18:11] and they read ahead, so I have to black
[1:18:13] out the screen.
[1:18:17] But, and if I was sitting in your seat,
[1:18:18] I'd read ahead, too. And I'd probably
[1:18:21] hate say amen before. Yeah. Ruin
[1:18:23] everything.
[1:18:25] But the whole point
[1:18:27] is is I'll I'll open it just for a
[1:18:31] minute. She has to be molded and made
[1:18:33] into the image of Christ and Christ is
[1:18:35] the word. Brother B ask the question did
[1:18:37] I in seeing that is the bride already
[1:18:40] called?
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Is it already finished? And I don't
[1:18:42] believe so because I didn't get the call
[1:18:44] till 1999. So
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; I personally don't believe it was
[1:18:48] already done. But what did he say? But
[1:18:50] but she has to be molded. Amen. To the
[1:18:53] word. She has to be molded into Christ.
[1:18:55] So even after the bride is called, it's
[1:18:57] not as just all all the bride's called
[1:18:59] and that's it. If the bride's called,
[1:19:01] she's still got to be molded. She's got
[1:19:02] to lay in the presence of the son. She's
[1:19:04] got to come to be exactly like Jesus
[1:19:06] Christ. She's got to grow into
[1:19:07] something. She's got to grow into the
[1:19:09] headship into the stature of a perfect
[1:19:11] man into the image of Christ.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; So he's teaching us a valuable lesson
[1:19:16] here. She has to be molded and made into
[1:19:18] the image of Christ. And Christ is the
[1:19:20] word. That's the only thing. See, it's
[1:19:23] in there. The It's in the word. There
[1:19:26] cannot be one thing added. It It can't
[1:19:28] be a woman with one hand like a man and
[1:19:30] other hand with a paw like a dog. It's
[1:19:32] got to be exactly the word of the Lord
[1:19:34] like he is the word. The bride is part
[1:19:36] of the bridegroom. The woman is part of
[1:19:38] her husband because she's taken out of
[1:19:40] the husband. Eve was a part of Adam from
[1:19:42] his side. And so is the bride. Not taken
[1:19:45] from a denomination, but taken from the
[1:19:47] bosom of the word of God for this day.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's showing that this this bride
[1:19:54] has got to come into the very image of
[1:19:56] Christ. And Christ is the word. Amen.
[1:19:59] And the word that has been revealed in
[1:20:01] our hour, which is the fullness of the
[1:20:02] word that's been restored to us. And she
[1:20:05] has to display all of that word because
[1:20:07] he is the word and she must become the
[1:20:09] word. So God is molding us into the
[1:20:12] image of Christ. Friend, we're not
[1:20:14] wasting our time here. Right?
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; We're not living this life just wasting
[1:20:19] time and thinking in ourselves, "Oh, I
[1:20:21] wish we'd finally get that last one so
[1:20:22] we could come in." Even if the last one
[1:20:24] was here, we still got to be molded into
[1:20:26] the image of Christ.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, listen, we're not sitting on
[1:20:31] our hands and twiddling our thumbs
[1:20:33] saying one day the rapture is going to
[1:20:34] come when we finally somebody in the
[1:20:36] mission field finally works hard enough
[1:20:38] and brings that last one in. Well,
[1:20:39] there's a truth to that. We're not going
[1:20:40] anywhere till the last one comes in. But
[1:20:42] even if the last one comes in, we're not
[1:20:44] going anywhere till we start reflecting
[1:20:46] the entire word of God. So for me to
[1:20:49] bring about the rapture means I must
[1:20:51] surrender more. I must listen more. I
[1:20:54] must feed more. I must die out to self
[1:20:56] more. If I'm going to move this rapture
[1:20:58] along, I'm not going to do it by sitting
[1:21:01] down and and and and grunting about
[1:21:03] missionaries and go find. I'm going to
[1:21:05] do it by molding myself to this word by
[1:21:08] allowing Christ to come and have his
[1:21:10] way.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. by allowing Jesus Christ and by by
[1:21:13] anything that's contrary to his words by
[1:21:15] denouncing it. Amen. And asking God to
[1:21:17] get it out of my life.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Because she's got to come into the very
[1:21:22] image of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:26] Amen. Friends, we we can't change
[1:21:28] ourselves, but we can sure surrender.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; We can we can sure feed on the word.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. There's so many times we want
[1:21:38] great changes in our life and we want
[1:21:40] everything in our life to change, but we
[1:21:42] just go on doing what we always did and
[1:21:44] we want everything in our life to
[1:21:45] change. Amen. If we want something in
[1:21:47] our life to change, amen, why don't we
[1:21:49] just dig a little deeper into the word?
[1:21:51] Why don't we just dive down a little
[1:21:52] more and why don't we commit ourselves a
[1:21:54] little more to the very thing that's
[1:21:56] changing us?
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:01] God, help us.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Help us. Amen. Listen, this word is
[1:22:07] changing us.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; We're coming into his likeness as he
[1:22:11] reveals himself. Amen. In the preaching
[1:22:13] of the word and all of that. But listen,
[1:22:15] Sunday and Wednesday is not enough,
[1:22:16] friends. We've got we've got to care
[1:22:18] about nothing else.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:23] Because she has to be him.
[1:22:26] In the Leodysian church age,
[1:22:29] brother BM says the church is no longer
[1:22:32] the mouthpiece of God. It's its own
[1:22:34] mouthpiece. So God is turning on her. He
[1:22:37] will confound her through the prophet
[1:22:39] and the bride. For the voice of God will
[1:22:41] be in her. Yes, it is. For it says in
[1:22:43] the last chapter, Revelation 17, the
[1:22:45] spirit and the bride say, come once
[1:22:47] more. The world will hear direct from
[1:22:48] God as at Pentecost. But of course, that
[1:22:51] word bride will be repudiated as in the
[1:22:54] first age.
[1:22:56] God
[1:22:57] has a voice on the earth.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe that he says this again
[1:23:02] later in the latest church age. God
[1:23:04] still has a voice for the people of the
[1:23:05] world even as he has given a voice to
[1:23:08] the bride. That voice is in the bride as
[1:23:10] we have said and we will talk about
[1:23:12] later. Why? Because he is dwelling in
[1:23:16] her.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; He is living in her.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; And the rapture has three phases to it.
[1:23:22] First is the shout. We've seen the shout
[1:23:24] go out and the shout is still going out.
[1:23:26] The message is going out and gathering
[1:23:27] people. Amen. gathering the bride
[1:23:29] together. But there's got to be a voice
[1:23:32] in the day, a voice of resurrection. And
[1:23:34] I'm I'm not here to tell you exactly
[1:23:36] what it will look like, exactly what
[1:23:37] will happen. But there's one thing for
[1:23:39] sure. God has a mouthpiece on the earth.
[1:23:41] And he has a voice on the earth. And
[1:23:43] that voice is in his bride.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; And that voice is maybe not always what
[1:23:49] we think a voice is.
[1:23:52] He says in Revelation 10, he says, "I
[1:23:54] looked and I took the little book out of
[1:23:57] the angel's hand and I ate it up and it
[1:23:59] was in my mouth sweet as honey. And as
[1:24:00] soon as I had eaten it, my belly was
[1:24:02] bitter. And he said unto me, thou must
[1:24:04] prophesy again before many peoples and
[1:24:06] nations and tongues and kings." So in
[1:24:10] the end time, the bride who's eating
[1:24:12] this book, she must be prophesying
[1:24:14] again.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; But I've read this quote to you many
[1:24:17] times, but I want to go to it again
[1:24:18] because it's just amazing to me. Brother
[1:24:21] says, "And here was voices." He's
[1:24:24] talking about voices that were in the
[1:24:25] throne room. He said, "And here was
[1:24:26] voices. Oh, how we need in
[1:24:28] Jeffersonville. Thousands of lived
[1:24:30] voices, the thunder of God thundering
[1:24:33] out in sweetness and holiness, purity,
[1:24:37] undefiled lives, walking around in the
[1:24:39] earth today without a blemish." Yes,
[1:24:41] sir. Real Christians, that's thunder
[1:24:44] against the enemy.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; The devil don't care how loud you can
[1:24:47] holler. The devil don't care how much
[1:24:49] you can jump or how much you can do this
[1:24:51] or shout. But what hurts the devil is to
[1:24:53] see that sanctified holy life
[1:24:56] consecrated to God.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; I love that. That's a little different
[1:25:01] than what we think sometimes.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Say anything to him, call him anything,
[1:25:08] just as sweet as he can be and move
[1:25:09] right on.
[1:25:11] That throws him away. That's the thunder
[1:25:14] that shakes the devil.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And not necessarily what we think
[1:25:18] is thunder that would shake the devil.
[1:25:20] We we would like to thunder against the
[1:25:22] devil sometimes, but the thundering
[1:25:24] against the devil is a surrendered life
[1:25:26] to Christ.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Living in humility and sweetness and
[1:25:30] just surrendering to God and letting God
[1:25:32] take control.
[1:25:34] Amen.
[1:25:35] And so, Brother B said in
[1:25:37] Jeffersonville, we need thousands of
[1:25:39] lived voices.
[1:25:41] A voice is something that declares a
[1:25:44] message. It speaks something to
[1:25:45] somebody. But brother Bam told us one
[1:25:47] time, he said, "I let your life preach
[1:25:50] your sermon."
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; I mean, not everyone's called to be a
[1:25:54] preacher. If you're called to be a
[1:25:55] preacher, preach it. But you've got to
[1:25:57] live it. Let your life live your sermon.
[1:25:59] And man, and and we as a people, we have
[1:26:01] to live the word. The word has to be on
[1:26:04] display. It can't just be in our mouths,
[1:26:05] but it has to be our life.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; And our life is the life of Christ in
[1:26:10] bride form in us. And it speaks volumes.
[1:26:13] It's a testimony. Listen, it's a life.
[1:26:16] And and when when brother Brandham
[1:26:18] surrendered to that life and that life
[1:26:20] came in him and began to manifest the
[1:26:22] word for our day, it was a super sign.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; And then we as a bride of Jesus Christ,
[1:26:28] if we could surrender ourselves to this
[1:26:30] word and give him access and room to
[1:26:32] work and he can come down and manifest
[1:26:34] that word in us and that word begins to
[1:26:36] manifest in all of us the fullness of
[1:26:38] the word in us. Guess what that's going
[1:26:40] to be again friends? That's going to be
[1:26:42] another super sign.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Because the super sign is God and man is
[1:26:46] one.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, if I could get the world
[1:26:54] to see that there you are. There's the
[1:26:57] body of Christ living, standing,
[1:27:00] redeemed, redeemed. Oh my. Justified in
[1:27:02] his sight." Why are we justified? We are
[1:27:05] his victory. The church is his victory.
[1:27:08] He came forth in the last days with this
[1:27:10] glorious gospel showing his victory. He
[1:27:13] died for this purpose and we are proof
[1:27:15] of his victory. Amen. When we see him
[1:27:18] coming down and living among the church,
[1:27:20] that's his victory.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Shows that he couldn't keep him in the
[1:27:24] grave, neither can they keep us. And we
[1:27:27] are already potentially arise because
[1:27:29] we've raised from the dead unbelief in
[1:27:31] his word from denominational creeds to
[1:27:33] an eternal word of the eternal God which
[1:27:36] is himself
[1:27:37] working through us manifesting himself
[1:27:40] that he is the same yesterday today and
[1:27:43] forever.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. When Jesus was on Calvary he had a
[1:27:48] work to do in that manifestation in that
[1:27:50] body of flesh that was God and man as
[1:27:52] one. That was the super sign. And in the
[1:27:54] super sign, he surrendered himself to
[1:27:56] God to do the work of redemption. And
[1:27:58] when he was on Calvary, hanging there.
[1:28:00] Amen. And the life was getting ready to
[1:28:02] leave his body. Amen. That was his
[1:28:04] victory in that day. His victory was
[1:28:06] being able to be crucified to bear the
[1:28:08] sins of the people and die in their
[1:28:11] place. And when he went to give up the
[1:28:13] ghost, he said, "Father, I commend
[1:28:14] myself in our spirit." He gave up the
[1:28:16] ghost. Amen. And he did his victory.
[1:28:18] Amen. This was his victory that he died.
[1:28:21] He shed his blood and he died as a
[1:28:23] substitute for you and I so that we can
[1:28:25] go free from what happened in the garden
[1:28:27] of Eden so the plan of God could move
[1:28:29] forward. This was redemption. It was his
[1:28:31] victory. And in his victory, he cried
[1:28:33] out. Amen. And he commended his soul to
[1:28:35] God and his spirit left his body. And
[1:28:37] all of a sudden, the temple veil rent
[1:28:39] from top to bottom to show that the
[1:28:41] mercy seat was there. That God, the
[1:28:43] atonement was paid, the price was paid.
[1:28:45] But it did something else. It woke up
[1:28:47] the sleeping saints. Amen. He had a
[1:28:49] victory in that day. And when Christ
[1:28:51] came forth, they came forth with him.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; When he ascended on high, they ascended
[1:28:57] on high. And they cried, "Lift up ye
[1:28:58] everlasting gates, and be ye lifted up.
[1:29:01] For the Lord of glory has come." They
[1:29:02] said, "Who is the Lord?" God grace
[1:29:04] Christ God mighty in battle. And he led
[1:29:07] captivity captive. What was his victory
[1:29:09] when he fully surrendered to the word
[1:29:11] for his day? When he gave his life
[1:29:13] completely to the purpose that God had
[1:29:15] for him and he and he died. Amen.
[1:29:19] That was a voice of resurrection.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; I woke up to sleeping saints.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, I'm not telling you how
[1:29:29] it will happen. I don't know how that
[1:29:30] voice. It's got to be the voice of Jesus
[1:29:32] Christ, the same one that woke up
[1:29:34] Lazarus. But I don't think it's a
[1:29:35] booming voice that all the earth hear
[1:29:37] yelling really loud. Okay, everybody,
[1:29:39] come out now. There's something God's
[1:29:41] going to do. There's a victory he's
[1:29:43] going to have in the end time, and it's
[1:29:44] going to bring the resurrection. Amen.
[1:29:46] There's got to be a perfect climax.
[1:29:48] There's got to be a perfection of his
[1:29:50] plan. There's got to be another super
[1:29:52] sign on this earth. And God's going to
[1:29:53] have another victory.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; And when we see him coming down and
[1:29:58] living among the church, that's his
[1:30:00] victory. What's it his victory in that
[1:30:02] day is that God could live in man and he
[1:30:04] could pay the price of redemption. He
[1:30:06] could become the atonement and set man
[1:30:07] free. And he had his victory.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; And that victory brought a resurrection.
[1:30:13] Amen. But in this day, he's looking for
[1:30:15] another victory. And what's his victory?
[1:30:17] And the purpose of the death and the
[1:30:18] reason for all of that is so that he
[1:30:20] could work his way back into mankind and
[1:30:22] back in the flesh and display that
[1:30:24] purpose in the end time.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Where's he going to do it? I hope he's
[1:30:29] going to do it right here inside of me.
[1:30:30] I believe by faith I'll be part of that.
[1:30:32] I want to be. And to do that, I've got
[1:30:35] to care about nothing else but this.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; That's the way Jesus lived. He cared
[1:30:40] nothing else about this purpose.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; And that's the way we need to live,
[1:30:44] friends. That's right.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:49] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:30:51] again. He says, "Never able to come to
[1:30:53] the knowledge of the truth." And these
[1:30:55] men resisted it as Janice and Jambre
[1:30:58] Jambre and Janice withtood Moses able to
[1:31:00] produce a church, produce a group of
[1:31:01] people. Yes, sir. But their folly will
[1:31:03] be made manifest when Jesus takes his
[1:31:06] bride, sets her up here, and said, "This
[1:31:08] is her." And away he goes with her.
[1:31:10] That's right. And their folly will be
[1:31:12] made known. Amen.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not going to interpret how
[1:31:15] that'll happen because this is yet
[1:31:16] prophecy. I think this is yet prophecy.
[1:31:18] Amen. God will do it. How is he going to
[1:31:20] put this bride on display and say, "This
[1:31:22] was her." Then away he goes with her. I
[1:31:24] don't know what he's going to do, but I
[1:31:26] know his life in her is his victory and
[1:31:29] the purpose of his death.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; That's the victory he wants to have in
[1:31:33] this day. The victory he wants to have
[1:31:35] in this day was not to send Malachi 4,
[1:31:38] but Malachi 4 came to bring about this
[1:31:41] purpose to bring a people out. Amen. And
[1:31:43] to bring them in, out of
[1:31:45] denominationalism, out of hybridization
[1:31:47] and back into the fullness of the word
[1:31:49] and union with Christ. And that's his
[1:31:51] victory when he gets preeminence in his
[1:31:53] people.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; That's his great victory in this day.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:00] That's why when we look at what his
[1:32:02] great victory and his great purpose and
[1:32:04] what he's trying to accomplish,
[1:32:07] when I look at all of that
[1:32:10] and I I I look at what he's done to
[1:32:13] bring us here,
[1:32:15] I look at the vindication of a prophetic
[1:32:17] ministry, the miraculous, the the
[1:32:20] pictures, the videos, the tapes, the
[1:32:22] recording, the everything that he did,
[1:32:25] the world events that moved at the time
[1:32:27] a prophet was on earth so that you could
[1:32:28] have prophet point out the Elijah and
[1:32:30] the Ahab and and the movement and the
[1:32:32] world wars and all the things that
[1:32:34] happened and the bombing of Hiroshima
[1:32:36] and Nagasaki and tie it together with
[1:32:38] Revelation 13. I mean friends or
[1:32:40] Revelation 11. I marvel at what God did
[1:32:43] and I look at all that he did and he and
[1:32:45] he and he moved political powers. He
[1:32:48] moved people. He he did wars. He did
[1:32:51] everything all for what? All for this
[1:32:54] purpose. What purpose? so that
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; he could live in me.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; The power of this revelation to the
[1:33:08] individual.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; That's going to be the power that moves
[1:33:14] this program to completion.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:17] It's not going to be listen I don't
[1:33:21] personally this is my personal I don't
[1:33:23] believe it's going to be any big
[1:33:25] sweeping ministry that goes through and
[1:33:27] brings you know super tremendous
[1:33:29] revelation I don't believe it's I
[1:33:31] believe it's going to be all those
[1:33:32] individuals who just keep surrendering
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; keep surrendering keep surrendering and
[1:33:39] and he gets more preeminence and more
[1:33:40] preeminence and begins to manifest
[1:33:42] himself amen in everything in life
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; our thought life, our private life, our
[1:33:48] work life, our family life, our church
[1:33:51] life. And in every part of life, he gets
[1:33:53] the preeminence in our life. When we're
[1:33:55] by ourselves, he has preeminence. When
[1:33:56] we're alone with our thoughts, he has
[1:33:58] preeminence. When we're with our family,
[1:34:00] he has preeminence. When we're at work,
[1:34:01] he has preeminence. When we're out with
[1:34:03] the guys, he has preeminence.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; That's the great goal for this hour. And
[1:34:08] has everything to do with me as an
[1:34:10] individual and you as an individual.
[1:34:12] Listen, I'm not going to take a rapture
[1:34:14] for you and you're not going to take a
[1:34:16] rapture for me. This is an individual
[1:34:18] affair.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; But oh God, help me not to hold up
[1:34:25] progress.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Brother R makes this statement in
[1:34:30] shalom, and this one has been working on
[1:34:31] me. You know, I told you he talked about
[1:34:34] the symphony of Peter and the wolf, and
[1:34:36] he begins to talk through it all through
[1:34:37] this message of shalom.
[1:34:39] He said, "Man could close his mortal
[1:34:41] eyes to earthly sight and live in the
[1:34:43] presence of Jesus Christ." When you see
[1:34:46] his word being beat out in the great
[1:34:48] sympathy that we're living in, and he
[1:34:50] keeps changing the word symphony with
[1:34:52] sympathy that we're living in, changing,
[1:34:54] you must begin in the symphony. The only
[1:34:57] thing you can do if you're in the
[1:34:58] symphony, then you start, you begin to
[1:35:00] get into the rhythm.
[1:35:03] That's the way you do it.
[1:35:06] That's the way you do God. You don't
[1:35:08] stand off and look at it.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; You get into the rhythm of it.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; How do you get in there? You're born
[1:35:15] into it, into the rhythm of the word.
[1:35:17] When you become part of that word,
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; you had to become part of the dance to
[1:35:21] get out of the dance. You had to become
[1:35:23] part of the ball game. Something you're
[1:35:24] interested in to get to get in the ball
[1:35:27] game. Oh, I just want to pause here for
[1:35:30] a minute. Brother Beam's giving us He's
[1:35:32] giving us a key, friends. He's giving us
[1:35:34] a secret. He's giving us a clue. Amen.
[1:35:37] If if you're in the symphony,
[1:35:42] listen, I don't want to be listening to
[1:35:43] a symphony. I'm supposed to be in the
[1:35:45] symphony.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; As God's playing it out, each one of us
[1:35:48] have an instrument to play. We've got a
[1:35:50] part to play. We have something to do.
[1:35:52] And if you're in the symphony, then you
[1:35:54] begin to get into the rhythm. That's the
[1:35:57] way you do God. You don't stand far off
[1:36:00] and look at it. You get into the rhythm
[1:36:01] of it.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, this is what we need to
[1:36:05] be doing. This is what we all need to be
[1:36:07] giving our life to is getting into the
[1:36:09] rhythm of the symphony of the word for
[1:36:11] the end time. We're not standing off and
[1:36:13] looking. Brother Bam said we don't come
[1:36:14] together to talk about the message. We
[1:36:16] come to get into the message, to get
[1:36:17] under it, to put it on. Amen. We're not
[1:36:20] here just to talk about what happened.
[1:36:22] We're not here just to talk about
[1:36:23] exciting things. And we're not here to
[1:36:24] just to re-evaluate all the things God
[1:36:26] did through Brother Brandham. That was a
[1:36:28] super sign. Amen. to bring us out of
[1:36:30] Egypt and bring us into the promised
[1:36:32] land so that we could take our position
[1:36:34] as kings and priests and become a sign
[1:36:37] in this end time.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; That's what God wanted out of his nation
[1:36:42] of Israel. He wanted them to be a sign
[1:36:43] of the world, a holy nation, a super
[1:36:46] race, a a super nation of people to
[1:36:48] show, amen, to the world what a God
[1:36:51] people would look like. But they failed.
[1:36:53] And they always failed. And every
[1:36:55] generation has always failed because
[1:36:56] they left his word. And when they left
[1:36:58] his word, they failed to become that
[1:37:00] super sign to the world. But God's
[1:37:02] predestinated a people in the end time
[1:37:05] that's not going to fail.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; But I want to get into the rhythm of the
[1:37:10] word.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. In this message, I think it's this
[1:37:15] message might be another one. He starts
[1:37:16] talking about Amen. One person, you
[1:37:19] know, their whole job is to bang that
[1:37:20] symbol. One part. They got one little
[1:37:22] part and the whole symphony. Amen. and
[1:37:25] their only part is to bang that simple.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; And brother B starts talking about our
[1:37:30] parts and the what we can do for God and
[1:37:33] what God can use us for. And he says, he
[1:37:35] says, "But the symphony wouldn't be
[1:37:37] complete without that one part."
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Comes to a crescendo. It comes to a
[1:37:42] major part that has to have impact. And
[1:37:45] it needs that big gong to bang at a
[1:37:47] certain time. But it can't bang out a
[1:37:49] rhythm. It can't bang out a sequence. It
[1:37:51] can't bang out a time. It'll ruin the
[1:37:53] whole message of the symphony. It's got
[1:37:55] to sit there and wait for its time. And
[1:37:57] while it's sitting there waiting for its
[1:37:58] time, you can't go to the lobby and get
[1:38:00] popcorn. You can't go out. Amen. To see
[1:38:02] what's happening outside. You got to
[1:38:04] stay in rhythm with the symphony as
[1:38:06] everybody plays their part, waiting for
[1:38:08] your turn to come to play your part.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen friends.
[1:38:18] Brother Bam takes the simplest of the
[1:38:20] simplest things to teach us some of the
[1:38:22] most important lessons that we can
[1:38:24] learn.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. How are we going to come into this
[1:38:28] symphony? Amen. If we're not devoting
[1:38:31] time and attention, if we're not getting
[1:38:33] into the rhythm of what the spirit's
[1:38:34] doing in this age, Amen. We we get
[1:38:37] distracted. And the question is, what is
[1:38:39] distracting us?
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; What is distracting our attention? What
[1:38:43] is it? I mean, I can just imagine the
[1:38:45] little guy with the gong and he's got
[1:38:46] his little paddle there and he knows I
[1:38:48] mean, he's got like three sheets of
[1:38:49] sheet music before he gets to him and he
[1:38:51] gets interested in something happened in
[1:38:52] the crowd and the little kid went to the
[1:38:54] bathroom. Now there's a fly
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; and you may even see him sweep at it
[1:38:59] with his with his mallet once in a
[1:39:01] while.
[1:39:02] Listen, that kind of that kind of
[1:39:05] sincerity, that kind of dedication is
[1:39:07] going to cause him to miss his part and
[1:39:09] ruin the whole symphony.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; But what he's got to do is follow along
[1:39:15] in the sheet music. Listen to the change
[1:39:17] in the junctions and and catch where
[1:39:19] we're at in the rhythm. Where are we at
[1:39:21] in the beat? How close are we? Amen. Am
[1:39:24] I ready? Is it for me? No. I keep
[1:39:26] moving. I keep waiting. I keep going.
[1:39:27] But you got to stay engaged. And
[1:39:30] friends, in order for us to move with
[1:39:31] this symphony of God, we have got to
[1:39:34] stay engaged with what God is doing in
[1:39:36] this hour.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; We've got to be listening. We've got to
[1:39:39] be reading. We've got to be praying.
[1:39:41] Amen. Amen. We've got to be in
[1:39:42] fellowship with one another. Amen. We've
[1:39:44] got to be in rhythm with this symphony.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; We live in a world that's riddled with
[1:39:53] distraction.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; And you carry around a little black
[1:39:56] Well, some of you have really nice
[1:39:58] pretty pink ones and stuff, but little
[1:40:00] phone.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; And it's an instrument of distraction.
[1:40:03] It's a distraction for me, too.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; But but the whole world is riddled with
[1:40:08] distractions, things that take our time
[1:40:10] and attention. But I can't think of
[1:40:12] anything more valuable that to put my
[1:40:15] time and attention into than to the
[1:40:16] symphony.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we think, well, I'm not being
[1:40:22] used and I don't have a position in
[1:40:24] church and nothing's really happening
[1:40:25] with me. Listen, that is no way.
[1:40:29] That is no way to be ready when your
[1:40:32] part comes.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. You've got to be moving from
[1:40:37] beginning to end.
[1:40:40] Amen.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Say, "God, help us to stay in the
[1:40:45] rhythm."
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Brother B makes this statement. I
[1:40:49] thought it was so good at the end. You
[1:40:51] have to become part of the dance to get
[1:40:52] out of the dance.
[1:40:55] You have to become part of the ball
[1:40:56] game. Something you're interested in to
[1:40:57] get in the ball game.
[1:40:59] Listen, there's things I'm interested
[1:41:01] in. There's things I'm totally not
[1:41:02] interested in.
[1:41:04] If you took me to a NASCAR event and I
[1:41:07] sat there for hours watching cars go
[1:41:12] I mean when everybody shouts I have no
[1:41:14] idea what they're shouting about.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; If something good happens out there I
[1:41:18] don't even know what the good thing is
[1:41:19] that happens and everybody gets excited
[1:41:21] about it because I'm not in the rhythm
[1:41:23] of the race.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; But you'll see people who will lose
[1:41:27] their minds cuz one car passed another.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. They go absolutely berserk or
[1:41:33] they're yelling at the pit crew because
[1:41:35] it was two seconds too long and they're
[1:41:37] swearing profanities at a pit crew that
[1:41:39] can never hear them.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; They're at a ball game threatening the
[1:41:44] life of the umpire and his children and
[1:41:46] his grandchildren.
[1:41:49] Why? Because they get into the rhythm of
[1:41:51] the game and everything that's happening
[1:41:52] on the field is affecting them
[1:41:54] emotionally. It's moving them. Amen.
[1:41:56] They become hysterical. They become
[1:41:58] enthused. They become excited. Amen. and
[1:42:00] they have euphoric feeling. They leave
[1:42:02] they leave a building where they've done
[1:42:03] absolutely nothing for 4 hours but watch
[1:42:06] other people do something for 4 hours
[1:42:08] and they leave feeling great and and
[1:42:10] then listen what listen how they talk
[1:42:11] when they leave. Wasn't that a good
[1:42:13] game? You see this? We won.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah, right.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; We we
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Which inning did you play in? Why I
[1:42:22] didn't see you at bat? I mean, what do
[1:42:24] you mean we won? Because they got into
[1:42:27] harmony with the game. They became part
[1:42:29] of it, one with it. There was somebody
[1:42:31] they were rooting for, a team they were
[1:42:33] involved in, and they they knew
[1:42:35] everything that happened on the field.
[1:42:36] They went through the es, the flows, the
[1:42:38] highs, the lows, the good, the bad, the
[1:42:40] tense moment, the exciting moment. And
[1:42:42] they walked away feeling so good and
[1:42:45] feeling like we won.
[1:42:47] I want that feeling when I see my
[1:42:49] brother and sister overcome. When we see
[1:42:51] God break through, when we see somebody
[1:42:54] come to the Lord, somebody's eyes open
[1:42:56] to the revelation of the mystery.
[1:42:57] Somebody take a step they couldn't stay.
[1:42:59] I want to say we won. We won. We won. I
[1:43:03] want to get into the harmony. I want to
[1:43:05] get into the symphony. I want to say the
[1:43:07] word is working. Look at what it's doing
[1:43:09] in their life. Look what it's doing in
[1:43:10] my life. Look at what it's doing for all
[1:43:12] of us. Amen.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; I don't want to sit on the sidelines and
[1:43:16] show up on Sunday and see how good the
[1:43:18] preacher preaches this Sunday and come
[1:43:20] to Wednesday and say, "Well, you know,
[1:43:22] my critique is this and he could have
[1:43:23] bad and he could get out of your mind
[1:43:26] and get back into the symphony of what
[1:43:28] God is doing.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; I want to be part of it.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; I want to play my position. And I want
[1:43:37] listen if my position is to cheer for
[1:43:39] the one who's running the first base. I
[1:43:41] want to cheer for the one who's running
[1:43:42] the first base. I want to be enthused.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; They say I don't know because I'm not an
[1:43:49] athlete. But they say that the roar of
[1:43:51] the crowd and the energy in the stadium
[1:43:53] can actually move the team. It can
[1:43:55] inspire them. Amen. It can get move them
[1:43:58] to greater feats. Amen. Listen, why
[1:44:00] don't we become a team? Why don't we
[1:44:02] root for our team? Why don't we become
[1:44:04] enthusiastic? Why don't we create a
[1:44:06] cheer and an enthusiasm and an
[1:44:08] excitement for whoever's running on the
[1:44:10] field and whoever's catching the ball?
[1:44:12] Why don't we pick up the intensity a
[1:44:14] little bit and get excited about the day
[1:44:16] that we live in? Listen, we're here to
[1:44:18] manifest another super sign. What is the
[1:44:21] super sign? Jesus in his day manifest
[1:44:23] the super sign of the resurrection.
[1:44:25] Death has no more hold on the children
[1:44:28] of God. He overcame death in himself. He
[1:44:31] said, "I have power to lay my life down.
[1:44:32] I have the power to take it up." And
[1:44:34] when he took it up, he didn't take it up
[1:44:36] for himself only, but all the saints
[1:44:37] that had slept in the Old Testament came
[1:44:39] with him. That was a super sign.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; And listen, we're living in the hour of
[1:44:44] another super sign. There's going to be
[1:44:46] a resurrection of sleeping saints. Amen.
[1:44:48] The super sign is among us. It's taking
[1:44:50] place. He's bringing it to pass right
[1:44:53] now. Almost any moment, any hour, any
[1:44:55] day. Amen. You're going to see saints
[1:44:57] arise.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; That we should be excited about. We
[1:45:02] should be in the rhythm of the
[1:45:03] resurrection. Amen. Listen, there's
[1:45:05] going to be an enthusiastic thing take
[1:45:07] place one of these days that's never
[1:45:09] happened before. Amen. There's going to
[1:45:11] be a people on this earth that don't
[1:45:13] resurrect
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; because they're not going to need a
[1:45:18] resurrection because they're going to be
[1:45:20] so one with God that God is going to be
[1:45:22] so alive in their flesh that their flesh
[1:45:25] cannot die. But it'll change
[1:45:29] in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.
[1:45:31] It'll become a brand new body. No death
[1:45:35] but life.
[1:45:37] Let's get into the rhythm of the word.
[1:45:40] Let's get into the rhythm of the word,
[1:45:43] into the symphony that God's playing
[1:45:45] because we're living in the generation.
[1:45:48] Friend,
[1:45:51] are you tired of sitting on the
[1:45:52] sidelines wondering why everybody around
[1:45:54] you is excited and you don't know what
[1:45:55] they're excited about? Are you tired of
[1:45:57] sitting there saying, "All he's saying
[1:45:59] is confusion to me." I'm telling you,
[1:46:01] get into the message.
[1:46:04] Read, listen, talk about the only thing
[1:46:08] that matters in life.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; What you're doing. Amen. If God's not in
[1:46:13] it, it'll come to nothing.
[1:46:15] But if God anoints our day, if God
[1:46:18] anoints our work, if God anoints our
[1:46:20] family, if God anoints our hobby, then
[1:46:22] God is manifesting himself in us.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; This is the day we live in, friends.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; There's another super sign getting ready
[1:46:30] to manifest itself.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; The super sign of eternal life coming
[1:46:35] into flesh.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; That's what this message has come to
[1:46:39] bring us to.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Get into the rhythm. Amen.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Get into harmony.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; No more going to church to see what
[1:46:49] happens.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to church to make
[1:46:54] something happen. I'm going to church
[1:46:55] cuz I'm in the rhythm. I'm going to
[1:46:57] church to bring an atmosphere. I'm going
[1:46:59] because we're growing by word by word.
[1:47:01] The bride is going up. Revelation upon
[1:47:04] revelation. Our eyes are becoming open.
[1:47:06] The Isab is bringing us crystal clear
[1:47:08] vision. Service by service, message by
[1:47:10] message, tape by tape, day by day,
[1:47:13] fellowship by fellowship. We are rising,
[1:47:16] friends.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; And it's going to come to a place where
[1:47:21] there's no other option but
[1:47:23] resurrection.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Let's go on with this quote.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; You have to become part of the dance to
[1:47:31] get out of the dance. You have to become
[1:47:32] part of the ball game. Something you're
[1:47:34] interested to get to get in the ball
[1:47:36] game.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to become part of the
[1:47:39] word to know God's symphony. That's
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; His symphony is when it's playing. You
[1:47:45] understand? You're marching with the
[1:47:46] beat of the time. You're watching for
[1:47:48] it. The works that I do shall you also.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Greater than this shall you do. These
[1:47:54] last days, oh my, the great changing of
[1:47:56] the time. We get into the beat of the
[1:47:59] word. Find his purpose. The hour that
[1:48:01] we're living, get into the rhythm of it.
[1:48:03] How does it? If you get into the word,
[1:48:06] you find out how he did at the
[1:48:08] beginning. Then you know what he's doing
[1:48:10] all the time.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Listen, he wants to manifest through me.
[1:48:15] He wants me to pray. He wants Listen, we
[1:48:18] should believe when we pray, God hears
[1:48:20] and God moves because God wants to
[1:48:21] manifest himself. We should believe when
[1:48:24] we when we read prayer requests from up
[1:48:25] here, we expect them to be answered
[1:48:27] because God is going to show where his
[1:48:29] life is. He's going to show what he's
[1:48:31] doing in this hour. We got to get into
[1:48:33] the rhythm of the symphony and expect
[1:48:35] him to do abundantly above all that we
[1:48:37] ask or think because why? He's going to
[1:48:40] show another super sign. He's going to
[1:48:42] show his resurrected life in fullness in
[1:48:44] a many membered body.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; And what will happen and what he will
[1:48:49] do? I don't know all the particulars or
[1:48:51] details, but I know what I saw when he
[1:48:53] showed the super sign of a prophet in
[1:48:54] this day and what I watched there means
[1:48:57] everything is possible. Nothing is
[1:48:59] impossible and nothing's off the table.
[1:49:02] spoken word of creation.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Possible.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Walking on water, possible.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Disappearing like Philip and showing up
[1:49:10] 100 miles. Possible.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Supernatural provision by spoken word
[1:49:15] possible. Healings instantly possible.
[1:49:17] Salvation to those we love. Possible.
[1:49:20] It's all possible because God showed us
[1:49:22] through the super sign what's possible.
[1:49:24] And he's bringing another super sign.
[1:49:26] God and man becoming one in bride form.
[1:49:30] And we should believe it's possible and
[1:49:32] then get into harmony and rhythm with
[1:49:34] those possibilities.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Not waiting to see what the preacher is
[1:49:39] going to do next and what great gifts
[1:49:40] going to come along and who's going. No,
[1:49:43] I'm part of the game. I'm I'm in this
[1:49:45] thing. I'm on the team. We are going to
[1:49:48] win.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, it be so good to leave church and
[1:49:53] say, "We won.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; We got a greater revelation of the word.
[1:49:58] We got a great enthusiasm. We got a
[1:50:00] greater we got a ra g g g g g g g g g g
[1:50:01] g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g
[1:50:01] g g g g g g g g g greater determination
[1:50:02] to serve God with all my life. Wasn't
[1:50:04] that a good game? We won today.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Not the preacher this and he could have
[1:50:08] done that and he should have used this
[1:50:10] example over here and that song lead. He
[1:50:12] kind of missed it on that song. Did you
[1:50:13] hear him hit the wrong chord? Stop that
[1:50:15] nonsense and get into the rhythm of what
[1:50:18] God's trying to accomplish in this day.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; All of that stuff is ruining, Amen. the
[1:50:24] purpose of God. criticism and critique
[1:50:28] and
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; just say we won.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm rooting for my brother to win.
[1:50:34] I'm rooting for his home to win. I'm
[1:50:36] rooting for that one who's sick to win.
[1:50:38] Amen. I'm going to show up and I'm going
[1:50:40] to raise my voice. Amen. We might do a
[1:50:42] wave. Amen. And we're going to win.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; We can't lose.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; But it's got to be all of us.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Individually. Every gong banger, every
[1:50:55] trumpet player, every flute player,
[1:50:57] everybody who's got a part to play has
[1:50:59] got to play their individual part when
[1:51:01] the time comes for them to play their
[1:51:03] part. And when they're not playing their
[1:51:05] part, they've got to be in the in the
[1:51:06] music moving with it, tapping their foot
[1:51:08] to it. And when the when the obo plays,
[1:51:11] yeah, they did that right. That was
[1:51:12] good. Amen. We're coming to my part.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Individual together, one
[1:51:19] individual as a body. Me. Amen. God
[1:51:22] having predestinated in me so that God
[1:51:24] can have predestinated in all of us so
[1:51:25] that God can show us super sign.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; So we have preeminence in us.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you two more quotes
[1:51:34] and then we'll stop.
[1:51:36] And what are we coming here for? What
[1:51:39] are we doing? Are we come here playing a
[1:51:42] game? Are we coming here meeting as a
[1:51:44] lodge? It's Christ can't come until that
[1:51:48] church is perfectly right.
[1:51:50] He's waiting on us.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; I believe we're at the end.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Oh God, don't be waiting on me. Let me
[1:51:58] get into the rhythm of what you're
[1:52:00] doing.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Says in 1959, he says, "And what was the
[1:52:05] Holy Ghost given for?" God's waiting on
[1:52:08] me and you. The church is waiting on me
[1:52:11] and you. Adoption time when God can pour
[1:52:14] into us his fullness, his power, his
[1:52:16] resurrection. that when the church and
[1:52:18] Christ become so close together till
[1:52:20] Christ becomes visible among us.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; And raises the dead and we go in the
[1:52:26] rapture.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; How's it going to happen? Amen. And
[1:52:31] until Christ, the church and Christ
[1:52:34] become so close together, till Christ
[1:52:36] becomes visible among us.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing it?
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; He's here, friends.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; The power of the word is manifesting.
[1:52:44] It'll continue to manifest. This will
[1:52:46] never stop. Amen. This will never quit.
[1:52:49] It's promised that it won't quit. It
[1:52:51] won't stop.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Get into the rhythm of the symphony of
[1:52:56] God.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; His end time plan, his end time purpose,
[1:53:00] and what God is doing in this end time,
[1:53:02] and what he's doing with me in this end
[1:53:05] time symphony.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand together. Musicians,
[1:53:09] please come.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:53:11] I just want to ask you,
[1:53:14] are you tired of sitting like me at a
[1:53:16] NASCAR game?
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; NASCAR game. It's not a game, it's a
[1:53:19] race. Shows you how good I am.
[1:53:24] Tired of feeling out of rhythm with
[1:53:26] everyone else around me.
[1:53:29] Listen, don't blame everybody else
[1:53:32] around you.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; It's that's easy. That's cheap. I don't
[1:53:37] I don't feel anything. I don't feel
[1:53:38] everything. I don't feel that's it's
[1:53:41] cheap to say everybody else is wrong.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Why not digging down deep and saying,
[1:53:47] "God, I want to connect with you on a
[1:53:48] deeper level."
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; I I want that personal individual thing
[1:53:53] that brings me right into harmony. I
[1:53:55] want to read from your sheet music. I
[1:53:57] want to catch what you're doing. I want
[1:53:59] to hear the rumbling and know, "Oh,
[1:54:00] that's just on time. That's exactly what
[1:54:02] he said."
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; I want to hear something said from a
[1:54:05] brother or sister said, "That's what
[1:54:06] brother Bam said in that mess." And
[1:54:08] that's that that's what he said would be
[1:54:09] in our day. And see a testimony, hear a
[1:54:11] testimony, and say that's exact. Now
[1:54:13] we're moving right in time with the
[1:54:15] sheet music.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; I want to be in rhythm with what God is
[1:54:20] doing.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I I want to devote my whole
[1:54:26] life to it. Give my whole time and
[1:54:27] attention to it.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And I know you do, too.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; That's why we're here. That's why we
[1:54:35] can't contain ourselves. That's why we
[1:54:36] get excited when we hear the word of God
[1:54:38] preached because we know it's absolutely
[1:54:40] the truth and this is the hour.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; We don't know how we're going to do it.
[1:54:45] We don't know how we'll accomplish
[1:54:46] anything. But we know one thing. It's
[1:54:48] prophesied to be done and it's in the
[1:54:50] sheet music. And if I stick with the
[1:54:52] sheet music, it's going to happen
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; in my life.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together and pray.
[1:55:03] Amen. Oh God,
[1:55:06] Lord, I want to say I love you, Lord.
[1:55:11] Your word is so powerful. It's so rich.
[1:55:13] It's so true.
[1:55:15] God, it's a power that's beyond
[1:55:17] intellect. It's a power that's beyond
[1:55:19] human. God, there's a supernatural power
[1:55:22] attached with this revelation.
[1:55:25] That supernatural power is working in
[1:55:27] our souls. It's bringing us to a place
[1:55:30] that you've predestinated for us to be.
[1:55:33] God, give us the courage, the ability,
[1:55:36] Lord, to sacrifice more of our life and
[1:55:38] dedicate ourselves more to this
[1:55:40] movement, Lord, to the movement of your
[1:55:43] word, to the cycles of it, to the beat
[1:55:45] and the measures of the symphony that
[1:55:47] you're playing. And God, let me play my
[1:55:51] part faithfully.
[1:55:53] And God, while I'm waiting to play my
[1:55:55] part, let me be engaged with every other
[1:55:57] part of the symphony, connected and
[1:56:00] attached and in harmony and unity in the
[1:56:03] rhythm of your beat so that I know what
[1:56:06] you're doing and I know where we're
[1:56:08] going and I know what parts being
[1:56:10] played.
[1:56:12] Lord, we love you, Lord. God, I pray you
[1:56:15] take this reality, Lord, that you've
[1:56:17] played out for us tonight or this
[1:56:19] morning. May it become a reality in
[1:56:21] every individual heart. God, we who have
[1:56:23] been distracted, forgive us, Lord. We
[1:56:25] who have put other things first, forgive
[1:56:27] us. We who got discouraged and
[1:56:29] disoriented and been wandering around
[1:56:32] aimless for a while, God, forgive us for
[1:56:34] that. Then bring us back into the rhythm
[1:56:36] of your word, Lord. God, help us to come
[1:56:39] back to our devotion, back to our
[1:56:42] sincerity, Lord, back to our focused
[1:56:44] attention,
[1:56:46] God, so that we may stay completely 100%
[1:56:49] in rhythm with the time of what you're
[1:56:51] doing. For God, we know you have to have

[1:56:56] You've promised it. And we want to be
[1:56:58] those people.
[1:57:00] God, I pray that you would take all
[1:57:02] that's been preached, all your prophet
[1:57:04] said, all we've preached for years, all
[1:57:07] we've heard, and bring it to a
[1:57:09] manifestation in our lives. God, it's a
[1:57:12] revelation. And the revelation is
[1:57:14] thrilling to us. but bring the
[1:57:16] revelation to a manifestation
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; that this would become a living reality,
[1:57:21] a living word, not a word that's just
[1:57:24] believed, but a word that is acted out
[1:57:27] and demonstrated
[1:57:29] that it's alive in your living stones.
[1:57:32] God, we commit ourselves to you. I
[1:57:34] commit these people to you. We commit,
[1:57:36] Lord, everything we do to you. God, help
[1:57:40] us. Forgive us, strengthen and encourage
[1:57:43] us, Lord. inspire. I believe you've
[1:57:45] challenged us this morning. I believe
[1:57:47] you've inspired us in that challenge.
[1:57:50] May we come back to a first love. May we
[1:57:52] come back to one focus. May we come back
[1:57:55] to where this is the only thing that
[1:57:56] matters.
[1:57:58] Bring us Lord into that place where our
[1:58:01] foot is tapping in time again and our
[1:58:04] whole body, our whole being, our mind,
[1:58:06] our focus, our emotions, and everything
[1:58:08] is back in harmony with what you're
[1:58:10] doing in the message in this hour.
[1:58:14] through your people. God, carry us as we
[1:58:16] go. Bless us along our way. Thank you so
[1:58:21] much for your word.
[1:58:23] We're so grateful, Lord. Bless us, we
[1:58:26] pray, as we move and try to surrender in
[1:58:29] a greater way. Take that preeminence
[1:58:31] we're yielding to you and come and be
[1:58:33] the great one among us.
[1:58:36] Come Lord and be the super sign in these
[1:58:39] bodies of clay as we yield them to you.
