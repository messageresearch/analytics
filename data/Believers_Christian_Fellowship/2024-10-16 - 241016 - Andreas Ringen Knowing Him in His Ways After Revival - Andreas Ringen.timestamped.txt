[13:33] think it's just a privilege to live in
[13:35] this hour and to meet ministers and uh
[13:39] preachers that this God called for for
[13:41] the purpose and to see where we are in
[13:45] that Vision together it's always amazing
[13:48] as I'm traveling quite a bit around the
[13:51] Lord has sent us to different places and
[13:54] it's just a move that is is there around
[13:57] the world Amen it's it's not just
[13:59] located to one place it's not here's a
[14:02] headquarter or there our headquarter as
[14:04] brother ROM would say is in heaven and
[14:07] Heaven is the word amen amen so that's
[14:10] our headquarter and we are so grateful
[14:12] for having fellowship and knowing one
[14:14] another before the we meet on the other
[14:16] side having really the great privilege
[14:19] amen God bless you amen let's take our
[14:21] Bibles we just want to because it's a
[14:23] Wednesday also and I I I have the um uh
[14:28] I'm I'm quite long winded many times so
[14:31] uh I have a reputation like that so I I
[14:34] trust that I don't stress your time
[14:36] straight from the beginning amen and so
[14:39] uh if somebody gets tired uh no problem
[14:42] if somebody falls asleep no problem with
[14:44] me uh I always say that in home I don't
[14:47] have any problem with that just don't
[14:49] snore too loud so that's that's that it
[14:52] might be a little difficult amen we
[14:54] greet you see some some people from God
[14:57] bless you from England is that right God
[14:59] bless you good to see you all here it's
[15:01] just
[15:02] surprising amen let's turn our Bibles
[15:05] and uh go to the to the Book of Psalms
[15:09] we want to read um one only one verse
[15:14] and uh and then we go to Genesis
[15:18] 18 amen we want to read a very familiar
[15:21] scripture and we trust that the Lord
[15:24] will really anoint his word inspire us
[15:27] that we are going where the Lord wants
[15:30] us to go because what we need something
[15:32] real for the hour that we are living in
[15:34] amen that's brother when I would say the
[15:36] time of church you know that that habit
[15:38] is just over doesn't work anymore uh
[15:41] amen so we need we need something to
[15:43] face the challenges of the hour amen and
[15:46] so we trust that the Lord will grant us
[15:49] uh a little bit more insight amen Psalm
[15:52] 103 I want to read only one verse verse
[15:57] 7 Psalm 1
[16:01] 103:7 amen and that will stay with us
[16:03] this evening for a short while Moses uh
[16:07] will stay a little bit with us and uh we
[16:10] want to see the connection between Moses
[16:12] and Elijah uh because we had an Elijah
[16:15] in our day amen and uh he brought us a
[16:19] message uh or through him a message came
[16:22] and and as as it was um the prophet
[16:25] would say uh in the church AG book what
[16:28] he brings will will literally turn the
[16:30] hearts of the children back amen and so
[16:32] we believe that amen and so it's just we
[16:36] want to see the connection verse 7 Psalm
[16:38] 03
[16:40] 103:7 he made known his ways unto
[16:44] Moses his acts unto the children of
[16:50] Israel amen it's a it's a uh if we had
[16:54] enough time we could because it's it's
[16:56] involved in a psalm and uh to show what
[17:00] God all is you know and and then verse 7
[17:04] said he made known his ways unto Moses
[17:07] his acts unto the children of Israel
[17:10] amen amen and then we want to turn to uh
[17:13] Genesis
[17:14] 18 Genesis 18 we want to uh read very
[17:20] familiar scripture Genesis 18 we want to
[17:22] read the verses
[17:24] one and two
[17:29] verse1 and 2 and three very familiar we
[17:31] all are very familiar with that what it
[17:34] means and that it happened in our day uh
[17:37] as a type here and the Lord appeared
[17:39] keep that also in mind as we go uh the
[17:42] Lord appeared unto him in the plains of
[17:46] memory and he sat in the tent Door In
[17:49] the Heat of the day also remarkable not
[17:53] in the cool of the evening but In the
[17:55] Heat of the
[17:57] day and he Liv up his eyes and looked
[18:00] and L three men stood by him and when he
[18:03] saw them he ran to meet them from the
[18:06] tent door and bowed himself towards the
[18:11] ground and he said my Lord if now I have
[18:15] found favor in thy sight pass not away I
[18:18] pray thee from thy
[18:20] servant amen isn't that
[18:23] amazing amen he sees three
[18:27] coming and he said my
[18:30] Lord amen let's pray together heavenly
[18:32] father it's such a wonderful privilege
[18:35] that we have again and what would we do
[18:37] Lord without you what would we do
[18:40] without your presence what would we do
[18:42] without the assurance that you lead and
[18:44] guide us father we would not have the
[18:47] courage to stand here father and but now
[18:51] as you have blessed us in such a great
[18:53] way we ask one more time open your word
[18:57] to us father and just unveil yourself a
[19:01] little bit more so that the Great I Am
[19:05] becomes more visible amongst us we pray
[19:09] father just anoint Thy word anoint thy
[19:12] servant anoint the hearers that are here
[19:15] and for we ask it all in the name of
[19:18] Jesus Christ to your honor and to your
[19:21] glory amen amen God bless you you may be
[19:25] seated amen so I just uh I just felt
[19:29] something on my heart to uh to speak on
[19:31] a on a little subject this evening of
[19:34] knowing him in his
[19:36] ways um knowing him in his ways and and
[19:40] also pointing it to the day that we are
[19:43] living in after the Revival has
[19:48] begun uh so we will we will try because
[19:50] we understand we are living already in a
[19:53] Time past the prophet left the scene
[19:56] many years ago um I think some of the
[19:59] people here maybe are from that area
[20:02] even know that so it's it's it's many
[20:04] years ago that the prophet was here and
[20:07] the Lord took the prophet away because
[20:10] his work was done amen he so now but but
[20:14] since then I think a lot of things have
[20:17] changed situations have become uh not
[20:21] not more easy actually more more many
[20:23] times more difficult more challenging
[20:26] but as it happens as the church is
[20:29] maturing so the maturing of the church
[20:32] is visible with the problems that uh we
[20:35] are facing today so God would only allow
[20:39] certain areas to come because the the
[20:42] church has reached a kind of
[20:45] maturity amen and and and as we Allow Me
[20:49] Maybe to to start something with with a
[20:52] statement of the Prophet from looking at
[20:54] the
[20:55] Unseen and uh we really want to want to
[20:59] go this evening and and rephrase a
[21:01] little bit we we all know that the
[21:03] prophet came and what the prophet has
[21:05] done but really what the the purpose of
[21:07] the Prophet really was and and and
[21:10] clearly to understand um uh what he was
[21:13] really here for what he really
[21:16] introduced to us and and uh and brother
[21:19] randam would say in the message looking
[21:21] at the Unseen he see after reading the
[21:24] scripture he he say he say he's telling
[21:27] the people may God bless
[21:29] his word and we are thinking of a day
[21:33] that has gone where God we thinking of a
[21:36] day that has passed that is gone as we
[21:39] are remembering a day that the prophet
[21:42] was here that is gone and brother Ram
[21:44] said do we remember thinking of a day
[21:46] that has gone has passed where God moved
[21:50] in in in a in a manner uh to reveal
[21:55] himself to men to make his ways known
[21:59] unto men through his servants His
[22:02] prophets
[22:04] amen so brother randam is is is using
[22:07] and he said what the prophet came for
[22:11] was actually to make known the ways of
[22:15] the
[22:16] Lord so that we and and and as we have
[22:19] read the scripture in Psalm which was
[22:21] which was it's easy read where it said
[22:24] that God was made known his ways unto
[22:27] Moses and and to the children of Israel
[22:30] his
[22:31] acts amen and and but I I I want to say
[22:34] straight from the beginning this evening
[22:37] it's not enough if you know him in his
[22:39] act it's not enough it will not meet the
[22:43] challenge of the hour if we just know
[22:46] him in his acts so God God needs to be
[22:50] identified he needs to be
[22:53] recognized so so as even Moses or
[22:56] Abraham as we was was uh seeing there in
[23:00] in in Genesis 18 as uh as Abraham was
[23:05] and it was a very interesting day it was
[23:08] actually long after after the the whole
[23:12] move had started uh it started actually
[23:15] um if I can call it the Revival or the
[23:19] move of God started uh in in Genesis 12
[23:22] when God called Abraham he just called
[23:26] him and there it all started actually
[23:28] they had begun when God just came to
[23:30] Abraham and he C him Genesis 12 we don't
[23:34] take the time to go to to the the the
[23:38] the Genesis to chapter 18 what all
[23:40] happened in that time Genesis 12 13 14
[23:44] 15 16 17 a lot of things had happened a
[23:48] lot of things had happened to Abraham
[23:51] with Abraham Abraham saw God in in many
[23:54] different ways God spoke to him in many
[23:57] different he saw he saw I believe
[23:59] Abraham saw many manifestations of God
[24:03] he saw many acts of God and I want to
[24:05] say by that also Sarah she had the
[24:08] privilege on her journey to see really
[24:12] manifestation acts of
[24:15] God but all the acts of God were not
[24:20] able to change
[24:22] them amen and and that's why there had
[24:26] to be a visit amen and Genesis
[24:29] 18 they had to come a visit it was not
[24:33] enough what had happened to Abram even
[24:36] because you know remember even the time
[24:38] when MDC came to him and and gave him
[24:41] bread and one it was a time for Abraham
[24:44] when Abraham and how the the journey so
[24:47] amazingly started that God would call
[24:50] him and this is the way God is doing it
[24:52] we have to understand God and the the in
[24:55] the ways that he is doing things that
[24:58] how we have to identify him this evening
[25:02] amen
[25:03] amen do we believe that he is here this
[25:07] evening amen many times we just believe
[25:10] that because the Bible said so and
[25:13] that's right you understand we
[25:15] understand the Bible said but two or
[25:17] three are gathered in my
[25:18] name but in this hour we need to know a
[25:23] more clearer
[25:25] presence amen because the challenges of
[25:27] the day
[25:28] uh we need to know him we just need to
[25:31] know him we need to know that he is
[25:33] present because we understand when he is
[25:35] present all things are okay as brother
[25:38] randam would say preached the sermon
[25:40] there's a man here that can turn on the
[25:44] light if he turns on the light or not
[25:46] it's not so important but it's important
[25:49] that a man is here that can turn on the
[25:53] light and even if it stays dark if the
[25:56] man is there so he we have contact with
[25:59] that man nothing bothers so you
[26:02] understand how important it is that we
[26:04] understand that that man is here and
[26:07] that man surely was not William
[26:10] brandham that man was not William
[26:12] brandham Brother rham spoke of a
[26:14] different man he said there's a man here
[26:17] that can turn on the light amen but if
[26:21] we just know that he is here he is
[26:23] present that's enough amen if you're
[26:26] just aware of his Pres it doesn't matter
[26:29] what happens around us it just doesn't
[26:32] matter amen it just doesn't matter as as
[26:36] we understand as he is present and and
[26:38] and very interesting also as Abraham had
[26:42] seen had so many so many manifestations
[26:45] of God and all the manifestations he
[26:48] would tell to Sarah he would tell her
[26:50] you know what happened many
[26:51] manifestations he saw himself Sarah was
[26:54] not present there was a few things where
[26:56] Sarah was present she was present in
[26:59] Egypt straight I think is Genesis 13 or
[27:02] 14 she was there when when when whole
[27:06] Egypt was actually like under a curse
[27:08] because of her
[27:10] presence she was there so so she had a
[27:12] little insight and she knew also a God
[27:17] that can
[27:18] act a God that can that that that you
[27:22] you you
[27:23] recognize in his acts you you see oh
[27:26] when things happening like that you
[27:28] understand God is present if you see
[27:30] healing here tonight we understand God
[27:33] is
[27:34] present is that right amen you
[27:38] understand but in this hour we need we
[27:41] need much more of assurance of his
[27:45] presence amen you you need to be assure
[27:48] of his presence even if you don't get
[27:52] healed amen so and and and and really
[27:56] amazing as we see in gen genis 18 after
[27:59] all uh the things um that that that
[28:04] Abraham had uh lived out and and uh
[28:07] where he come from but all that he has
[28:10] seen all the
[28:13] manifestation all the manifestation
[28:16] didn't uh didn't change his body yet
[28:19] right also Sarah all the manifestation
[28:23] all that she had seen didn't change her
[28:26] body yet amen that's why the visit in
[28:30] Genesis 18 was
[28:32] necessary that's why a prophet had to
[28:36] come in this hour with all what we had
[28:39] before with all the manifestation what
[28:42] we saw and what we understood and
[28:45] received and experienced a prophet had
[28:47] to come and not only a prophet had to
[28:49] come because as Abraham is he a type of
[28:53] the Prophet is Abraham a type of the
[28:56] Prophet watch it Abraham starts with a
[28:58] Bram starts with b and I always say if
[29:01] you say A you must say B you you
[29:04] actually and we understand the same
[29:05] story that happened to Abraham happened
[29:07] to William Branham is that right we
[29:09] understand how his name was changed and
[29:11] his name was changed is that correct
[29:14] just to show us actually that God is
[29:16] doing the same to the church through
[29:18] that vessel as he did through from
[29:20] Abraham to
[29:22] Sarah amen and it was finally it was not
[29:25] Sarah actually it was not Sarah up to
[29:28] date Sarah was in a condition um we we
[29:32] come maybe a little bit later to that
[29:34] she was she was so influenced because
[29:37] the uh the time that she was living in
[29:39] was a terrible time they never were in
[29:44] Sodom also not Sarah but they lived
[29:48] under Sodom conditions
[29:50] am amen and because they lived under
[29:53] Sodom condition it had an effect on
[29:57] Sarah if you really watch her life yet
[30:00] and and this is the same with us we are
[30:03] not in
[30:05] lodia is it correct we are called out of
[30:08] lisia as Adam was not in as Abraham was
[30:11] not in Sodom so we are not in lisia amen
[30:16] yes we living under lisan
[30:19] conditions and these conditions affect
[30:23] us amen this affect us this affect the
[30:25] Family Life totally today the condition
[30:28] yet you may be not in loud this year but
[30:31] yet as Abraham and Sarah you are
[30:33] affected by the
[30:35] conditions amen and and and and really
[30:39] shortly looking what conditions they
[30:41] really lived in uh at that time that
[30:44] makes a little bit more clear why Sarah
[30:47] reacted the way she
[30:49] reacted amen amen so she was affected
[30:53] she needed that
[30:55] visitation she needed that visit ation
[30:58] and also that visitation of Genesis
[31:02] 18 after after a few moments or a few
[31:06] minutes or I don't know maybe half an
[31:07] hour as in this
[31:10] visitation uh so so Elohim was not
[31:13] talking to
[31:15] Abraham if you really see him coming it
[31:18] was actually Abraham doing the
[31:20] talking inviting him he never opened his
[31:24] mouth just as they were sitting together
[31:28] having Fellowship suddenly he opened his
[31:31] mouth and made plain the
[31:34] purpose of this
[31:36] visitation you know what he asked
[31:38] Abraham where is
[31:40] [Music]
[31:42] Sarah so he kept quiet all the time he
[31:45] just kept quiet he enjoyed what Abraham
[31:48] did but his whole purpose of coming was
[31:52] not
[31:53] Abraham so this whole purpose of coming
[31:56] in this hour was not because of William
[31:59] brandham this whole purpose of God
[32:02] coming in this hour was because of the
[32:05] Bride of Jesus
[32:07] Christ so he made it so plain isn't it
[32:09] amazing as they were sitting he kept
[32:12] silent he didn't say nothing as as he
[32:14] enjoyed the food that Sarah was a part
[32:17] of suddenly he opened his mouth and he
[32:19] unveiled the purpose of his coming he
[32:22] said where is Sarah he never said
[32:24] Abraham how are you he he see that was
[32:26] fine but this time this visit was just
[32:30] for
[32:31] her church do you understand that this
[32:35] visitation that William Brandon was here
[32:38] to declare to us who it
[32:40] is it was brother brandham he declared
[32:43] to us it was God telling him to tell us
[32:47] it is the same as Abraham told Sarah so
[32:51] Sarah was not sitting in the tentor
[32:53] looking at it no because of the Sodom
[32:57] condition that they were
[32:59] in come on come on church that was the
[33:02] days you understand that it was the hour
[33:05] where Sodom was burned is it
[33:07] right amen is absolutely so so they had
[33:11] Sodom
[33:13] conditions yet they were not in Sodom
[33:15] yet the Sodom condition affected
[33:20] them we better believe that so because
[33:24] in in this day you can do what you want
[33:26] you are not a part of ludia anymore
[33:29] because God called you out is it right
[33:32] you know we are not in lisia anymore yet
[33:35] this the condition of lisia is affecting
[33:39] us we are not in lisia but we live in
[33:43] lisia so the condition affects us the
[33:46] same way as it affected
[33:49] Sarah amen that's why we needed that
[33:52] visitation that's why we have to
[33:54] understand that visitation was because
[33:57] we would come into conditions like we
[34:00] are in now because be
[34:03] honest 60 years ago as brother random
[34:06] would speak of Sodom condition what
[34:09] about
[34:11] now what about
[34:14] now I mean we could we could go into it
[34:17] we don't do but we just realize it
[34:19] remember as it was as bad as it was in
[34:22] the time remember when the Angels
[34:24] finally came to
[34:25] Sodom when they finally came came and
[34:29] they they visited or you know they they
[34:31] they came to the the door of the house
[34:33] where lot lived lot lived not in sod but
[34:36] at the gate he was you know he he as the
[34:39] Bible would say and as they came the
[34:41] whole the Bible said whole Sodom
[34:44] came young and
[34:47] old all came because there was man
[34:53] coming so so lot was trying to quieten
[34:56] down the group
[34:58] in sending or you know satisfying the
[35:00] people and sending his girls out and
[35:04] what did they say we don't want
[35:07] girls that was the condition come on
[35:10] church that was the condition that Sarah
[35:14] was affected by yet she was not in Sodom
[35:17] but she was affected that's why we
[35:19] understand her her her ways how she
[35:23] acted come on she she was she was
[35:25] affected as we are many times our young
[35:28] people are
[35:29] affected we are so many times affected
[35:32] the the spirits don't know any border
[35:35] you understand that so they don't care
[35:38] to what church you go to so they know
[35:41] exactly and we are living in Satan's
[35:44] Eden right he is the God of this Eden is
[35:48] that right this is his Eden this is not
[35:51] God's Eden am this is his Eden where he
[35:54] is doing what he wants and we are
[35:57] pilgrims we are strangers in this
[36:00] Eden amen so really really understand it
[36:03] makes a little bit more clear why Sarah
[36:06] reacted the way he reacted and brother
[36:08] ROM was so um it was so amazing how he
[36:11] would he could look behind the scene how
[36:14] he could tell us situations out of the
[36:17] life of Abraham and Sarah do you know
[36:19] what brother wam told in that morning
[36:21] when when Abraham actually was sitting
[36:24] and it's beautiful for me this this
[36:26] scene is beautiful described here in the
[36:29] Bible he was sitting there in the heat
[36:31] of the
[36:33] day are we not living here in the heat
[36:37] of
[36:38] lisia In the Heat of the day we are
[36:40] living here right and In the Heat of the
[36:43] day Church In the Heat of the
[36:49] day he didn't know God just in his
[36:55] act yes sir
[36:57] oh trust trust we we allow that to that
[37:02] it really drops
[37:05] down see he saw God in so many in so
[37:08] many different ways he saw so many acts
[37:10] of God but he saw more than acts of God
[37:15] Amen all the time when he saw things he
[37:19] learned he he understood God in his ways
[37:23] now here came three men and no one had
[37:27] had a pillar of fire above his
[37:31] head amen it was a tanic
[37:35] visitation in human bodies is that right
[37:38] they could eat and they could drink so
[37:41] it was it was normal so on the outside
[37:45] now that man didn't carry a message book
[37:47] with
[37:48] him so as we many times identify when
[37:51] you go somewhere you know how do you get
[37:53] one another you know yeah I got the book
[37:54] in my hand okay then so but he just came
[37:57] and he was an ordinary man yeah he
[38:00] didn't look different than the other two
[38:03] right there was nothing in him amen
[38:07] nothing nothing there that Abraham could
[38:09] see
[38:10] ah but as Abram was looking at those
[38:15] three
[38:16] Hallelujah you understand as we are
[38:19] looking this evening on human
[38:23] vessels amen where God is living is that
[38:26] right this is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[38:29] is that true so as we are looking to
[38:32] vessels amen we should clearly identify
[38:36] the presence of the
[38:38] Lord is that not
[38:40] amazing how Abraham and here and and and
[38:43] that that man that never waved Abra said
[38:45] look look it's me it's me go it's me
[38:46] it's me no he just acted like the others
[38:50] and as Abraham looked at him looked at
[38:54] him he saw an identification
[38:58] because all his life he never only
[39:02] looked at God at his acts he could see
[39:06] God and he learned to know God in his
[39:10] ways God is identified by his
[39:15] characteristics is that right can we
[39:18] identify God today by his
[39:24] characteristics amen hallelujah
[39:27] amen so I and but really looking at the
[39:30] day really very very close I felt it's
[39:33] it's it's very important that we see the
[39:34] outside world and to really to
[39:37] understand and also to understand us and
[39:40] to understand why why a message came to
[39:44] make known unto us amen a prophet came
[39:50] to make known unto us God in his
[39:55] ways Hallelujah I trust we really
[39:58] understand but really watch really watch
[40:00] it was all the acts all the situations
[40:03] everything Sarah has seen so far and I
[40:06] believe she has seen marvelous acts
[40:08] right of God I I I believe she was there
[40:11] many times with Abraham as things were
[40:13] happening you know and she was witness
[40:16] eyewitness and yet and yet we understand
[40:19] she came at the end in in because it was
[40:22] the hour where the where the where the
[40:24] Fulfillment of the body change yeah was
[40:27] not happened yet so it was actually a
[40:30] quite silent time right mhm and we
[40:35] understand we are living actually in a
[40:38] time when it's quite a silent time
[40:41] people people want to make a lot of
[40:43] noise to not accept that we are living
[40:45] in a silent
[40:47] time because they cannot handle silence
[40:51] am have you see I I had people at my
[40:53] work I mean early years when people
[40:55] would come at morning into into what
[40:57] place the first thing they have to turn
[40:59] is a radio on because they cannot handle
[41:04] silence amen I want to ask you a
[41:07] question can you handle
[41:09] silence can you handle a silent God
[41:14] Amen oh you have to know him in his ways
[41:17] then you can handle a silent
[41:19] God Amen a silent God
[41:23] means silence in heaven yeah as we would
[41:27] hear it is an
[41:31] approval prise
[41:33] Lord you understand when a son comes to
[41:37] adoption sir the silent
[41:40] father is an approval
[41:43] prise I have sons they are they are
[41:46] above
[41:47] 30 if they are crying I don't
[41:52] move because I know they can do it
[41:56] themselves that's right
[41:58] come on Church sir God knows more what
[42:02] you are able of right than you know
[42:05] about
[42:06] yourself God knows if he allows things
[42:10] to come to you he told us he he would
[42:13] never test us about what we are able is
[42:16] it right so all that comes to us amen is
[42:20] not to bring us down is just to show us
[42:23] of what we are capable
[42:25] of it just actually shows us how far we
[42:28] are that's right so a silent God Church
[42:31] let never the devil tell you that a
[42:33] silent God is something that is
[42:38] bad amen oh can you can you oh no we
[42:42] don't go there we we don't we don't we
[42:45] we don't want to mess up the time from
[42:46] the beginning amen but but as we as we
[42:50] understand in Abraham Abraham here he
[42:52] and and and and and Elohim was coming
[42:55] next to all the things that had happened
[42:57] to
[42:59] Sarah next to all the things that had
[43:03] happened even in the time that brother
[43:06] Bram was saying we can speak of all the
[43:08] the acts that God has done right and we
[43:12] have seen many isn't
[43:14] it yet we are still here and our bodies
[43:17] is not
[43:19] changed amen so so nothing what what has
[43:23] happened what we could have seen has yet
[43:26] changed our body that's
[43:28] right amen hallelujah right so so we
[43:33] understand it will need more than just
[43:35] to see an act a work of
[43:40] God brother random would say if you one
[43:44] day the dead in Christ would rise he
[43:46] said and when you see watch very
[43:49] carefully when you see them coming he
[43:53] said this will be the last hit to you
[43:57] yeah because then you know this is God
[44:01] in his
[44:02] ways as brother renham told us how the
[44:06] change will be now when you see them
[44:09] coming what do you see you don't see
[44:12] maybe maybe they make not a lot of
[44:16] noise because they will
[44:18] not because the world will not recognize
[44:22] them they just come to the elect is it
[44:25] is it right and when they come they
[44:28] don't show maybe a sign to
[44:31] you absolutely not but when you see them
[44:34] coming you see this is according to what
[44:38] the prophet told us how it will be you
[44:40] see God in his ways and that has enough
[44:43] power to change your
[44:44] bodies the prophet says this will be the
[44:48] final so that our bodies will be changed
[44:51] because we understand now we are in the
[44:54] way we are in the plan we are just in
[44:56] the and the rolling of how the Rapture
[44:59] will finalize amen hallelujah there's so
[45:03] much power and we we can see it a little
[45:05] later that this was also the cause for
[45:09] Sarah to be
[45:11] changed amen and and but but let's
[45:14] quickly look a little bit around what
[45:16] was really going on there and and
[45:18] brother Adam had a had a wonderful and
[45:21] he was not shy to tell us things I mean
[45:23] he he Abraham wouldn't tell us Sarah
[45:25] wouldn't tell us but the Prophet you
[45:27] know how many times the prophet could
[45:29] just go into things and he would just
[45:31] tell a
[45:32] story amen remember the the sermon he
[45:36] preached on he preached a sermon and he
[45:39] was just telling the story and he said
[45:41] you know there as in Eden I can see Adam
[45:44] and Eve Walking you know you know the
[45:46] the Clapping of the of the skin of the
[45:48] animal on their leg next day brother
[45:50] said yesterday as I was in the vision as
[45:52] I were in the vision that's
[45:54] right that's right amen it was the
[45:57] prophet telling us the
[46:01] secret the prophet telling us the secret
[46:05] why why
[46:06] Rebecca came out he told us the secret
[46:11] why Rebecca came out and did something
[46:14] that Eleazar didn't ask
[46:17] yeah amen yeah the prophet told us
[46:21] because Abraham had said Abraham you
[46:24] know elazar had said how how can I make
[46:25] sure and then Abra said the angel of the
[46:28] Lord will go before thee and he was
[46:30] brother Bram and he makes that beautiful
[46:32] statement he said the angel of the Lord
[46:35] was 30 minutes 30 minutes quicker than
[46:38] Eleazar so he went to Rebecca is that
[46:42] right so finally Rebecca came out and
[46:46] then Eleazar just asked that one
[46:49] sentence and he told the Lord that that
[46:52] damel that I'm asking for drink and she
[46:55] will feed the camels also but I don't
[46:58] tell
[47:00] her so don't just speak about we do what
[47:02] brother brandham
[47:04] said she did something brother brother
[47:08] brandom or brother elasa didn't say and
[47:11] that was a sign that she was bright not
[47:14] to do what the prophet tells us to do is
[47:16] the sign that you're bright it's just a
[47:18] sign that you can read
[47:20] right it's just a sign that you can read
[47:23] and accept but to do what he didn't told
[47:25] us to do
[47:27] this is the sign of the Bride finally
[47:29] and can you imagine how Ela was jumping
[47:32] for joy as he was just telling her he
[47:35] said okay can you give me to drink and
[47:37] she said out from herself and who was
[47:39] responsible the angel of the
[47:42] Lord hallelujah and that angel of the
[47:46] Lord church I just want to identify this
[47:49] evening in our midst amen I want to know
[47:52] him in his ways how he's doing things I
[47:55] want to be there like Abraham yeah yes
[47:57] sir so that saw three men coming and the
[48:00] way that they were acting the way they
[48:02] were going the characteristic showed
[48:05] exactly that's him
[48:08] hallelujah amen and such a difference if
[48:11] we know him in his Acts or if we know
[48:14] him in his
[48:15] ways Hallelujah that's why the Bible
[48:17] said my thoughts my ways my thoughts are
[48:21] higher than your
[48:22] thoughts amen that's right so when we
[48:25] know him in his ways that it's different
[48:27] you know like an old
[48:31] couple you have an old couple they know
[48:33] one
[48:34] another amen you know I can put another
[48:36] skin on I can paint my my face
[48:40] black my wife will look at me and just
[48:43] said don't fool
[48:44] me you know why she knows me that's
[48:48] right
[48:49] amen and she knows more about me than
[48:52] that that I like coffee with
[48:55] milk you know she knows more about me
[48:57] that's right and we show we should know
[49:00] by now yeah amen amen that's right so
[49:04] much more about
[49:06] God because we are married to
[49:10] Christ and Jesus Christ is the heart of
[49:13] God am so as we are married to Christ we
[49:17] should know much more about
[49:19] God Amen God should not be a stranger in
[49:23] our midst we should know him in his ways
[49:26] by now
[49:27] this is always the the the way I when I
[49:29] come to church as a minister I I I I
[49:33] have I just want I just don't want to
[49:35] have the scripture just the Bible word
[49:37] for it I just want to see
[49:40] him I want to see him in his way I want
[49:42] to be sure that he's present and I learn
[49:45] to know him in his
[49:48] characteristics Hallelujah sir that's
[49:50] why that's why those characteristics you
[49:52] cannot deceive yeah right brother Bram
[49:55] said Satan can imitate everything that's
[49:58] right but he can never imitate the
[50:01] characteristic that's right he cannot
[50:04] yeah amen and how how beautiful that
[50:06] Abraham was there looking at three men
[50:09] In the Heat of the day under under under
[50:12] Sodom condition a wife at home she had a
[50:15] very bad
[50:18] day
[50:20] yes you know how brother Ram is is
[50:22] beautiful how he's he's describing it he
[50:25] said that morning he said he said
[50:28] Abraham and Sarah as Abraham maybe said
[50:31] goodbye to Sarah and said look I go and
[50:33] sit in the T door and then Sarah just
[50:37] said to
[50:38] herself I'm
[50:40] wondering what kind of
[50:42] Fanatics my husband will entertain today
[50:46] oh oh
[50:48] my you understand that so the that the
[50:52] home Sarah was frustrated total
[50:55] frustrated that's right amen you
[50:57] understand she was totally frustrated
[50:59] yes sir the whole situation of Sodom was
[51:02] on her neck yeah maybe maybe she had a
[51:06] she had a cell phone like we have today
[51:08] and she was
[51:10] confronted with
[51:12] situations amen like we are
[51:15] confronted amen so you understand that
[51:18] Abraham under that condition I just want
[51:20] to make you very plain under that
[51:22] condition Abraham was sitting in the
[51:24] tenter In the Heat of the day this is in
[51:26] his neck you're not a beautiful home and
[51:29] they you know what I mean it's just just
[51:31] tension at home that's right that's
[51:33] right
[51:34] Hallelujah but I'm so glad and I'm so
[51:37] happy that all the time from Genesis 12
[51:40] yes he learned with everything that is
[51:43] heard from God he learned a little bit
[51:46] more about
[51:48] him remember when he met
[51:50] MDC or when MDC came to him you know MDC
[51:56] as Abraham was
[51:58] looking in the beginning God told him
[52:01] you know come out of and go into a
[52:04] country that I will show
[52:07] thee Paul tells us in Hebrew that he was
[52:10] looking for a city that's right so in
[52:13] the beginning it was just the country
[52:16] yeah because God couldn't show him and
[52:19] tell him everything from the beginning
[52:21] the same with us is it amen amen
[52:24] hallelujah amen in the beginning is just
[52:27] the bride is the
[52:30] land according to the Bible the bride is
[52:34] the land yeah that's right is that right
[52:36] right but then we learned as we moved on
[52:40] we learned that the Bride is a city
[52:42] that's right sir amen but remember as he
[52:46] met MDC in Genesis 145 or something like
[52:50] that and mzc came to him Abraham was
[52:54] actually on his on his journey to look
[52:57] for that City that's
[52:59] right and he
[53:01] recognized that the king of
[53:05] Salem would come to him and he
[53:08] understood when the king of a city is
[53:11] coming to me the city cannot be far
[53:16] away he understood
[53:19] that what he did not understand in that
[53:22] time that the king just came to his City
[53:26] God that's right so he didn't understand
[53:30] that
[53:31] he that the real
[53:34] him was where he was on the journey to
[53:37] find to am that's right amen prise prise
[53:40] the Lord but as he was walking and
[53:42] moving and God unveiling himself he saw
[53:45] so many acts and that's sad that too
[53:47] many people in the message are just
[53:49] focused on the
[53:53] acts when you tell him about ways they
[53:56] feel it's just Doctrine that's
[54:00] right or they feel it's too deep
[54:03] right so they rather have an act than
[54:07] the ways that's right that's
[54:12] true
[54:14] amen just just just just really be with
[54:17] me Sarah she saw many
[54:21] acts amen she saw many acts of God but
[54:25] nothing there yet to change your
[54:29] body
[54:31] amen hallelujah but it was it was really
[54:33] it was In the Heat of the day it was
[54:36] under Sodom condition and and as we are
[54:39] because as we look to Sodom condition we
[54:41] also have to
[54:43] realize as bad as the Sodom conditions
[54:47] are the Sodom conditions are
[54:50] connected to a work of
[54:54] God to a work of God amen the Bible said
[54:58] as it was in the days of
[55:01] Noah so shall it be when the son of man
[55:05] that's right
[55:06] comes right you go to Matthew you'll
[55:09] find that amen but then Luke 17 tells us
[55:14] 28-3 he said as it was in the days of
[55:18] Sodom lot lot the days of lot are the
[55:21] days of Sodom right and the days of lot
[55:23] and Sodom are the days of Abraham amen
[55:26] amen between the days of Noah and the
[55:29] days of lot is about several hundred
[55:33] years
[55:34] mhm amen oh it's wonderful you
[55:38] understand that and brother Randon would
[55:40] say Revelations 10 and he speaks about
[55:44] Luke
[55:45] 17 the day when the son of man is come
[55:49] he could say it is fulfilled am because
[55:52] the son of man had come in flesh again
[55:56] right amen but then as we see the days
[55:58] of Sodom and watch it very carefully
[56:01] watch it very carefully this goes
[56:03] together with the days of Abraham right
[56:06] and if we understand what God is doing
[56:09] now we understand him in his
[56:15] ways amen because the Bible said as it
[56:18] was in the days of Noah Sodom or lot so
[56:21] shall it be when the son of man is being
[56:24] revealed yes right is that right do you
[56:27] believe that the son of man today that
[56:30] we are living in the hour not so much of
[56:33] the coming of the son of man but of the
[56:35] revealing of the son of man and brother
[56:38] brandham made the statement he said the
[56:40] son of man is revealing himself now in
[56:44] me through me and then brother brandham
[56:47] said he said it will
[56:50] continue it will not just be me he will
[56:53] do the same work with you amen
[56:57] the prophet said I and you together we
[57:01] will do
[57:02] that so you understand what goes
[57:05] together with Sodom condition what goes
[57:08] together we understand and this is what
[57:11] Abraham could see this is what Abraham
[57:13] could understand he as MDC came to him
[57:16] and he didn't realize what it was later
[57:19] he
[57:19] understood see he had seen God in so
[57:22] many ways and so many in so many
[57:24] manifestations and he did not he he he
[57:27] just didn't just hang on just an act of
[57:30] God yeah but he did not fail to
[57:33] understand to learn to see him in his
[57:38] ways
[57:40] hallelujah what a different
[57:43] story nobody else could see it lot
[57:48] couldn't see
[57:51] it oh my lot couldn't see it he saw two
[57:56] yeah and he said my
[57:59] Lord Abraham saw
[58:02] three and he ran to one fell down before
[58:06] him that's right and he said my Lord
[58:10] what could he see he had understood God
[58:13] in his
[58:14] ways suddenly he saw the characteristic
[58:18] of all the manifestations he could see
[58:21] bundled up in one
[58:24] man my is it not true that all that God
[58:29] was he put into
[58:31] Christ and everybody is shouting
[58:35] amen but then he said all that Christ
[58:40] was is nowh Amen in the
[58:44] church amen that means all that God
[58:49] is is now in the
[58:51] church you understand that manifesting
[58:54] the characteristic amen oh I trust we
[58:57] can understand I trust we can see the
[59:00] difference between the church and the
[59:02] bride the church is going we will we
[59:04] will see a little later what the problem
[59:06] was with
[59:08] Israel that's why God would say to Moses
[59:11] I make known my ways to Israel my
[59:24] acts um it was would say it was a
[59:27] special time actually when he came to
[59:29] Abraham I even would call it a special
[59:32] difficult time Sodom conditions to the
[59:37] top just before Sodom was burned yeah
[59:40] that's right is that right so it was
[59:44] bad so so even without being in Sodom it
[59:47] was it was not
[59:50] nice so it was a time of
[59:53] waiting is that correct it was a time of
[59:57] waiting it was a time when the promise
[1:00:00] was given long ago and proven and proven
[1:00:02] and Vindicated and Vindicated that's
[1:00:04] right and God came in Genesis 15 and
[1:00:07] Vindicated it again to to Abraham that's
[1:00:09] right confirmed the promise that's right
[1:00:12] so he had also it was and then it was 16
[1:00:15] said it goes and goes and it was a time
[1:00:16] of waiting it was actually a time of
[1:00:21] Silence Hallelujah a time of Silence
[1:00:24] should only confuse the
[1:00:27] enemy the time of Silence should not
[1:00:29] confuse the church
[1:00:33] anymore Hallelujah because you know what
[1:00:35] happened in our day amen this is the
[1:00:38] hour we are just
[1:00:40] waiting on the Fulfillment of Romans the
[1:00:44] finalization of adoption amen is that
[1:00:47] right the final step of adoption which
[1:00:51] is the change of our bodies am that's
[1:00:53] right but this is the hour of adoption
[1:00:57] yeah that's right this is a time when
[1:00:58] the church is adopted and when the
[1:01:00] church is adopted don't be surprised
[1:01:03] about
[1:01:07] silence somebody can say Amen am if you
[1:01:10] know this is y of adoption don't be
[1:01:13] surprised about silence amen we should
[1:01:17] know God in his
[1:01:20] ways
[1:01:21] Hallelujah as a father as a father and a
[1:01:24] son when the time of adoption comes
[1:01:27] that's right and we understand the time
[1:01:28] of adoption is different than the time
[1:01:30] of birth amen that's right we understand
[1:01:33] Pentecost was the birth of the church is
[1:01:36] it correct but this is not the birth of
[1:01:38] the church that's right true amen this
[1:01:40] is the adoption of the church and when
[1:01:42] the church is in the adoption process it
[1:01:45] is not it is not a it is not is it
[1:01:48] should not be astonishing that God is
[1:01:50] silent that's
[1:01:53] right amen amen if you understand him
[1:01:57] and his ways what he's doing that's
[1:01:59] right that's right and as the hour comes
[1:02:02] that he said he see oh my oh my it was
[1:02:04] the hour of of when Esther came to her
[1:02:07] adoption that the King was
[1:02:12] silent Hallelujah the King was silent he
[1:02:16] was not calling for Esther he wasn't
[1:02:18] telling her now I married you because
[1:02:20] now come and do it no he was
[1:02:23] silent right right is that correct he
[1:02:25] was silent
[1:02:26] and in the beginning Esther was puzzled
[1:02:28] about The
[1:02:29] Silence she was just puzzled about as's
[1:02:32] being silent because you know there was
[1:02:34] a law in the land and the law in the
[1:02:37] land was that nobody could come to the
[1:02:38] king unless the king
[1:02:40] asked so Esther was a was waiting for
[1:02:43] the king to ask and he was silent amen
[1:02:47] amen and she was puzzled about The
[1:02:49] Silence amen one day Mori came by he
[1:02:52] said Esther he said you should not be
[1:02:55] puzzled about something
[1:02:56] silence prise God come on church it was
[1:02:59] a holy spirit coming to Esther telling
[1:03:02] her because you understand you came for
[1:03:05] a time like this to this
[1:03:09] position and when the King married you
[1:03:12] come on church when the King married you
[1:03:16] yes sir that means
[1:03:18] something yes sir that means
[1:03:21] something so Esther was puzzling she was
[1:03:24] and but the king would move you
[1:03:26] understand he wouldn't be okay okay no
[1:03:28] because he married her and with his
[1:03:30] marriage he showed everything to
[1:03:33] Esther amen come
[1:03:36] on oh my my my what is happening as
[1:03:39] brother random would preach the breach
[1:03:41] he made a very very amazing action as he
[1:03:44] preached the breach amen yo he's
[1:03:46] speaking about the lamb taking the book
[1:03:48] that's right is it right and then he's
[1:03:50] using phrases very very very very
[1:03:53] interesting that's right he said and
[1:03:56] it's the proph I just you know phrase it
[1:03:58] brother R said now the lamb come forth
[1:04:01] amen that's right and then brother BR
[1:04:03] said and let him take the book if he
[1:04:08] will yes sir and brother makes the next
[1:04:13] statement speak or forever hold your
[1:04:16] peace amen amen he does it in the breach
[1:04:19] that's right amen true you do that
[1:04:21] normally at a wedding
[1:04:26] right what is going on here remember
[1:04:29] brother Ram said the marriage takes
[1:04:31] place on
[1:04:32] Earth is it correct correct the marriage
[1:04:35] took place aerus took Esther as Queen
[1:04:40] and for him it was
[1:04:43] settled he had a lot of he had a lot of
[1:04:45] virgins to choose that but when he saw
[1:04:48] her come on jur when you saw her in the
[1:04:51] way that she was acting she said I have
[1:04:53] no choice
[1:04:56] because yes come on because she had a
[1:04:59] Chamberlain on her side that was
[1:05:02] responsible for the bedroom of the
[1:05:05] king so he knew exactly what the king
[1:05:08] liked in his bedroom and what not amen
[1:05:12] that's so as he gave it to Esther that's
[1:05:15] right and the King saw it yeah he un he
[1:05:19] understood plainly this is the one that
[1:05:22] you know why why vti was put away
[1:05:26] M she
[1:05:28] refused to show the beauty of the
[1:05:34] king
[1:05:36] amen that's why the church is refused
[1:05:40] yeah amen come on church because they
[1:05:44] refused to be pregnant with the further
[1:05:48] part of the word am that's right they
[1:05:51] call it fanatism yes sir they call it
[1:05:54] fanatism
[1:05:56] amen you know that's why vashi was put
[1:05:58] out yes sir because she refused to show
[1:06:02] the beauty of the king that's right of
[1:06:04] the Kingdom yeah that's right and and
[1:06:06] the King said I need another one yeah
[1:06:09] that is willing to unveil all who I am
[1:06:15] amen and when you saw Esther following
[1:06:18] higi amen he understood this is a woman
[1:06:24] that is able to unveil all of
[1:06:29] me that's why he was
[1:06:34] silent trust we can
[1:06:36] follow he was
[1:06:38] silent is it is it right and then Esther
[1:06:41] you know that came a day and she was
[1:06:42] really under pain and and she was she
[1:06:45] was she was she was struggling she she
[1:06:48] called a fasting out you know she
[1:06:51] something must be clear something is
[1:06:52] going wrong I that he he he he he never
[1:06:55] make a noise he never made he never
[1:06:57] wrote a letter he nothing amen that's
[1:07:01] right hallelujah praise God can can you
[1:07:04] see the picture see what God is doing
[1:07:06] yes sir can you see what God has done in
[1:07:08] this hour what he's doing with the
[1:07:10] church with the bride no there's nothing
[1:07:12] wrong Church there's nothing going wrong
[1:07:15] right amen that's right amen there's
[1:07:16] nothing going all is all is all is okay
[1:07:19] God is just manifesting more of himself
[1:07:22] that's and he's trying to ask you do you
[1:07:25] want to be my partner in my complete
[1:07:32] unveiling
[1:07:34] hallelujah
[1:07:36] amen and and as as the story went see
[1:07:40] it's another it's another story but as
[1:07:42] as it went with
[1:07:45] Esther
[1:07:46] finally you know she something broke
[1:07:51] open
[1:07:57] that's why brother bham said we should
[1:07:58] pray for
[1:08:02] Revelation more than for anything else
[1:08:05] so she had a three days of fast and
[1:08:09] prayer that's right for
[1:08:12] Revelation and then at the third day it
[1:08:14] broke open to her and then she said
[1:08:17] bring me the Garment amen that he
[1:08:21] married me in amen and as Esther
[1:08:26] was having that
[1:08:29] garment everybody was quite surprised
[1:08:32] and they felt now she's really no she
[1:08:35] now she's really you know she's moved
[1:08:37] and she's no
[1:08:41] no she said and everybody maybe was
[1:08:43] warning her Esther you cannot
[1:08:46] go but she no if you go without the king
[1:08:49] asking you it means you're
[1:08:53] death so as she she moved she never went
[1:08:56] backward to the king she never was
[1:08:58] crawling on her knees no right no she
[1:09:02] had
[1:09:05] recognized she had
[1:09:07] recognized what it was all
[1:09:10] about as the door was open and everybody
[1:09:14] kept his
[1:09:17] breath and the Bible said the king just
[1:09:20] put out his scepter right and he would
[1:09:23] tell Esther finally
[1:09:29] right
[1:09:33] finally and you understand that and she
[1:09:36] said King I was really
[1:09:40] confused because you know that is a
[1:09:43] law that tells you nobody can come to
[1:09:45] you
[1:09:46] unless you ask him yeah and the King
[1:09:49] said that's true Esther that is for the
[1:09:53] public
[1:09:57] that has nothing to do with
[1:10:00] you the Lord you
[1:10:03] understand when he came down when he
[1:10:06] took the
[1:10:08] book when he took the book that's right
[1:10:11] look how all changed yes sir no one was
[1:10:15] worthy not even to look at it that's
[1:10:17] right that's right but when he took the
[1:10:20] book when he said yes that's right
[1:10:23] that's right come on that's right the
[1:10:24] taking of the book is his yes that's
[1:10:28] right true I take you in
[1:10:31] marriage when he took the book is that
[1:10:34] right right before he took the book and
[1:10:37] only he could take the book is that
[1:10:40] correct it's always the husband that
[1:10:42] takes the wife and then the wife can say
[1:10:46] yes but it's his
[1:10:48] choosing is that correct amen so when he
[1:10:51] said yes and he took the book Hallelujah
[1:10:56] the same John a type of the Bride right
[1:10:59] that was not even worthy to look at the
[1:11:02] book now he is commanded to eat the
[1:11:07] book what a
[1:11:09] change right come on Church the same
[1:11:12] John that had that had no worthiness in
[1:11:15] himself the Bible said not even to look
[1:11:18] at it that's right amen that's true oh
[1:11:20] What is marriage changing amen that's
[1:11:23] right you understand that
[1:11:25] amen What is marriage
[1:11:28] changing
[1:11:29] Hallelujah so the Bible would say about
[1:11:33] Jehovah Jehovah would tell Israel Israel
[1:11:37] I am the Lord your maker that's right
[1:11:41] Isaiah you can read it the same God said
[1:11:44] you know and when he when he said when
[1:11:47] he said here the devil can jump
[1:11:53] in amen because who created the
[1:11:57] devil amen mhm that's right it's the
[1:12:01] same God Amen so as he said to
[1:12:05] Israel behold I am your
[1:12:08] maker Satan could say yeah well me also
[1:12:13] that's right you made
[1:12:16] me but then God said but that's not the
[1:12:19] whole story that's right he said Israel
[1:12:22] thy maker is also thy Redeemer
[1:12:26] and then the devil falls
[1:12:28] off but then it doesn't
[1:12:31] stop because if he redeems you he
[1:12:35] redeems you for a
[1:12:37] purpose that's right and then the same
[1:12:40] God said behold Israel thy maker who is
[1:12:44] thy savior is also thine
[1:12:48] husband and that shows the final
[1:12:51] relationship right that the Church of
[1:12:54] the Living God come to amen hallelujah
[1:12:57] and they come to that for a purpose yes
[1:13:00] it come for a purpose because God wants
[1:13:03] to unveil
[1:13:05] himself that's why it was the
[1:13:08] father it was
[1:13:10] Abraham looking for a wife that's right
[1:13:15] is it not this amazing that's right it

[1:13:19] right it was Abraham looking for a wife
[1:13:22] for Isaac is it correct yes sir is that
[1:13:25] not amazing so it was not Isaac hunting
[1:13:28] for a girl and said I need a no no it
[1:13:29] was Abraham said Isaac needs a
[1:13:35] wife and it was the father telling
[1:13:39] Eleazar don't go to that City don't go
[1:13:41] there it was not Isaac that's right it
[1:13:43] was Abraham telling why the father was
[1:13:47] concerned that's right it was not Adam
[1:13:50] making his own wife it was the father
[1:13:53] putting Adam to sleep yes amen at
[1:13:56] Calvary brother I'm said God put Christ
[1:13:59] to
[1:13:59] sleep so you are a work of God you know
[1:14:04] why you are a work of God because God
[1:14:06] wants to unveil
[1:14:08] himself that's why he is choosing a
[1:14:11] bride for
[1:14:12] [Applause]
[1:14:13] Christ oh isn't that wonderful because
[1:14:16] this is the unveiling of God we're
[1:14:19] living in the hour where God is
[1:14:21] unveiling
[1:14:22] himself am amen amen
[1:14:26] hallelujah hallelujah what a beautiful
[1:14:28] picture amen and and this is this but it
[1:14:32] it's it was for Sarah as we quickly go
[1:14:34] back it was for Sarah it was a waiting
[1:14:36] time allow me to to put that really in
[1:14:39] because we have to understand the hour
[1:14:40] that we're living
[1:14:42] in and uh under Sodom and under lisia
[1:14:48] conditions um it BEC so diff it became
[1:14:51] so difficult for Sarah that waiting that
[1:14:54] waiting became first
[1:14:56] frustrating because she was under the
[1:14:58] influence of of of
[1:15:00] Sodom you understand that she lived
[1:15:03] there she couldn't hand she couldn't do
[1:15:04] nothing on it she lived there and you
[1:15:06] cannot cannot help but you live in
[1:15:08] Satan's Eden right you are not in L like
[1:15:11] I said but you are affected by lisia
[1:15:14] conditions is that right everybody
[1:15:16] should be should have realized that this
[1:15:19] is the greatest battle what we have amen
[1:15:22] you you know you the spirits that are
[1:15:24] going around I mean you are affected by
[1:15:27] them even if you come to the best church
[1:15:29] here you're affected by them is that
[1:15:31] correct because we're living under and
[1:15:34] this brings a frustration so many times
[1:15:36] amongst us or amongst the family it's
[1:15:38] actually the spirit that is just this is
[1:15:40] this is those things that are let let
[1:15:42] loose on the earth is that
[1:15:44] [Music]
[1:15:46] right
[1:15:48] Hallelujah and yet and yet you
[1:15:51] understand how
[1:15:53] peaceful the one that came to Abraham
[1:15:58] was even when Sarah laughed he just said
[1:16:03] why does she
[1:16:07] love everybody could explain him
[1:16:10] why you know because it was it was fun
[1:16:12] is that right asking me an old
[1:16:16] lady but he said
[1:16:23] why so forg God
[1:16:26] is not a
[1:16:29] question when Sarah doubted God didn't
[1:16:32] doubt that's right you understand that's
[1:16:36] right because he did the choosing that's
[1:16:40] right and if God choose
[1:16:43] you you think God can make a
[1:16:47] mistake you think God is changing his
[1:16:49] mind on the way he said oh I think I
[1:16:51] think I choose the wrong
[1:16:53] one now cannot amen oh
[1:16:57] church we should understand if he choose
[1:17:00] you

[1:17:07] and even your bad
[1:17:09] days even your bad

[1:17:58] to you is that he chose
[1:18:01] you do you know that brother Ram had

[1:20:44] that we are actually that we are
[1:20:46] actually in we just waiting for the hour
[1:20:48] and and brother R would make it plain
[1:20:50] let me quickly rephrase it how he's
[1:20:53] telling us that what something had
[1:20:55] started remember in the third seal
[1:20:57] brother Ram is telling the people third
[1:20:59] seal brother Ram is is as I can maybe uh
[1:21:02] uh uh quickly quickly read it to you
[1:21:05] brother R said that's what he said the
[1:21:07] bride hasn't had to Revival yet just
[1:21:09] rephrasing things am there has been no
[1:21:11] Revival no manifestation of God to serve
[1:21:14] the bride yet we're looking for it now
[1:21:16] it will take those seven unknown
[1:21:18] Thunders back there to wake her up again
[1:21:20] amen is that right that's right and then
[1:21:23] we know a little bit later in the
[1:21:24] recognizing youday in this message
[1:21:25] brother I'm telling plainly that's
[1:21:30] right it happened that's right it
[1:21:33] started that's right amen amen that's
[1:21:36] right amen so we a long time after it
[1:21:39] started that's right is that correct
[1:21:43] surely we're not waiting for a bride

[1:22:21] Sarah Hallelujah that visit
[1:22:25] ation of not encouraging her a little
[1:22:31] bit this visitation was not just to
[1:22:34] mentally raise her up a little right
[1:22:37] that visitation was to show I cannot
[1:22:40] change my
[1:22:43] mind is it right this visitation that
[1:22:46] came to us that he appeared to us what a
[1:22:49] sign brother R wanted to show that to
[1:22:51] everyone God said no yeah that's not to
[1:22:54] the public that's just to my bride just
[1:22:58] for her right and turn the picture just

[1:23:02] me it's me coming it's the head come on
[1:23:05] church it's the head now coming to the
[1:23:08] body if the head comes to the body Jesus
[1:23:12] at that time 2,000 years ago he said
[1:23:14] foxes have holes birds have nests but
[1:23:17] the son of
[1:23:18] man has no body has no place to lay his
[1:23:22] head Jesus was not looking for a nice
[1:23:25] bed he wasn't looking for a wellness
[1:23:28] place he was looking for a
[1:23:31] [Applause]
[1:23:34] body Hallelujah and that body church we
[1:23:37] must accept that his coming allow me to
[1:23:41] say his
[1:23:44] appearance his appearance is a proof
[1:23:49] that the body is
[1:23:52] ready can we say Amen to that amen is is
[1:23:57] that the body is ready to receive
[1:23:59] it hallelujah what an hour are we living
[1:24:03] in church this is a proclamation this is
[1:24:06] God telling there we should not doubt it
[1:24:09] anymore because he he he told us I would
[1:24:13] not come
[1:24:16] down unless the body is
[1:24:21] ready oh my
[1:24:25] sometimes I I I I pray said Lord help me
[1:24:29] that we can make that clear to the
[1:24:31] people there's no reason for
[1:24:36] frustration you can
[1:24:38] frustrate
[1:24:44] frustration I believe that and not to
[1:24:46] put slogans
[1:24:48] up but as a as the enemy is trying you
[1:24:51] know you can give the enemy me a heart
[1:24:55] attack you can make him a n give him a
[1:24:58] nervous
[1:25:00] breakdown amen God is it right yes
[1:25:05] because we have the reality with us so
[1:25:08] regardless how your feeling conditions
[1:25:10] are right that's right feelings right
[1:25:15] I'm not interested to God Amen God is
[1:25:18] interested in do you believe
[1:25:25] oh my as but as as it is a time just
[1:25:29] just what watch carefully what we are
[1:25:31] really in now what really has
[1:25:34] started so we understand this is as
[1:25:37] brother Ram would say this is allow me
[1:25:39] quickly to rephrase he said this is
[1:25:42] church age book The Long awaited
[1:25:45] restoration amen they thought it was
[1:25:49] 2,000 years ago right they thought it
[1:25:52] was even when lisia
[1:25:54] started they thought isza Street was a
[1:25:57] long awaited restoration it was not amen
[1:26:00] but we are living in the hour amen amen
[1:26:04] where it said I will
[1:26:06] restore is that correct we are living in
[1:26:09] the hour of restoration right full
[1:26:13] restoration what means full restoration
[1:26:15] going
[1:26:16] back to where we came
[1:26:19] [Music]
[1:26:21] from oh my amen so this is allow me to
[1:26:25] say that this is the book of Acts
[1:26:34] 2.0 amen
[1:26:37] um let me quickly read to you the church
[1:26:39] age book and and see what brother bham
[1:26:41] is saying and and you will be you will
[1:26:44] be uh it you will enjoy it because we
[1:26:47] had we had a prophet amen telling us
[1:26:50] that that's right and now it's high time
[1:26:52] that we go back to what he said that's
[1:26:54] right yes sir not just to requote that
[1:26:58] but finally oh trust God opens our eyes
[1:27:01] finally we see what he
[1:27:08] saw yes
[1:27:10] finally we come to a time because you
[1:27:13] know when brother bam speaks something
[1:27:15] yes sir you cannot speak something
[1:27:17] unless you see something that's right
[1:27:20] true and as I always enjoy Also to say
[1:27:24] when
[1:27:25] people so in the message this became a
[1:27:27] slogan say what the prophet
[1:27:31] say and I say how can you say what the
[1:27:34] prophet said how can you say what I say
[1:27:39] not repeat me but say what I say right
[1:27:43] without you seeing what I
[1:27:46] saw and we have to see what Abraham
[1:27:50] saw and being able to identify him and
[1:27:53] his ways then we can say what brother
[1:27:56] Bram said otherwise we are just parrots
[1:28:01] right it just learned to
[1:28:05] repeat true Polly do this Polly do that
[1:28:08] Polly do this Polly do that that's right
[1:28:11] amen but we're not called to be parrots
[1:28:12] is that parot a good word we are called
[1:28:15] to be
[1:28:21] Eagles brother said Church H book page
[1:28:23] 15
[1:28:24] he said a wonderful statement he said
[1:28:27] let me show you he said listen
[1:28:32] Satan he knows that Jesus Christ is the
[1:28:35] same yesterday today and
[1:28:38] forever Satan knows
[1:28:40] that yes you know how he knows that
[1:28:43] because he can
[1:28:48] read believe
[1:28:51] me when he spoke with Jesus it was a
[1:28:54] proof that he could read he said it is
[1:28:57] written amen plainly showing that he
[1:28:59] could
[1:29:02] read but to read it was not enough prise
[1:29:06] God to deceive
[1:29:14] Jesus Hallelujah so the devil
[1:29:18] knows that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:29:20] yesterday today and forever and that he
[1:29:23] changed is not amen amen he knows that
[1:29:28] the whole lot more than do 90% of the
[1:29:31] theologians because they don't
[1:29:35] read he knows that since God is
[1:29:39] inable his nature then is just
[1:29:45] immutable in his ways so not he doesn't
[1:29:50] change listen very carefully
[1:29:54] th Satan knows surely that the original
[1:29:57] church at Pentecost with the power of
[1:29:59] God is the true church that Jesus claims
[1:30:02] to his
[1:30:04] own everything else is false it has to
[1:30:07] be now remember this is not now what
[1:30:10] Satan knows but now brother R said now
[1:30:13] remember all the other things Satan
[1:30:15] knows because plainly he can
[1:30:22] read how many people know about things
[1:30:26] because they can read the
[1:30:29] prophet is it
[1:30:31] right honestly reading enough is not
[1:30:34] reading is not
[1:30:38] enough that's so
[1:30:40] beautiful
[1:30:43] church he said
[1:30:46] um now remember brother Ram
[1:30:49] said Christ in the true church is a cont
[1:30:53] continuation of the book of
[1:30:59] Acts
[1:31:03] okay um a continuation of the book of
[1:31:09] Acts Christ in the true
[1:31:12] church is not
[1:31:15] reading what they did right that's right
[1:31:18] and then doing the same that's right
[1:31:20] amen
[1:31:24] a continuation is a
[1:31:29] continuation Hallelujah you know how the
[1:31:32] book of Acts was they never copied no
[1:31:36] [Music]
[1:31:39] one they never looked in a
[1:31:42] book as said two disciples that walked
[1:31:45] that morning to the gate called
[1:31:47] Beautiful they never headed out of a
[1:31:51] book amen amen
[1:31:54] Hallelujah that was the book of Acts
[1:31:56] right amen so the book of Acts in
[1:31:58] continuation is not to read what they
[1:32:00] have done and then looking forward to do
[1:32:03] the same right
[1:32:05] amen right not even going back 50 years
[1:32:09] yeah and trying to do what brother bham
[1:32:11] has
[1:32:11] done you don't need to do what brother
[1:32:14] bham has
[1:32:15] done because God manifested himself and
[1:32:19] now God is waiting to manifest more of
[1:32:21] him because it's the same son of man
[1:32:24] Ministry working now in a many membered
[1:32:30] body
[1:32:32] hallelujah
[1:32:34] hallelujah let's turn quickly to Matthew
[1:32:37] so we we have the time we have the time
[1:32:40] before
[1:32:41] us uh let's turn turn quickly to
[1:32:45] Matthew very amazing scripture
[1:32:50] and Malachi Malachi sorry Malachi 3
[1:32:57] so this is the book of Acts
[1:33:01] 2.0 this is Hebrews 13:
[1:33:06] 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:33:12] and
[1:33:14] forever um before we read that you know
[1:33:18] how brother
[1:33:19] Brenham could figure out find out that
[1:33:23] Martin Luther
[1:33:24] was a church age messenger for his
[1:33:27] church
[1:33:38] age if you study Martin Luther he was a
[1:33:41] German by the
[1:33:42] way
[1:33:47] so did he choose John
[1:33:49] Wesley was John Wesley a messenger amen
[1:33:56] I would not have chosen John Wesley
[1:33:58] right no
[1:34:01] true right you know that John Wesley had
[1:34:03] a broken up marriage
[1:34:06] right mhm right would you choose a
[1:34:12] messenger come on Church would you
[1:34:15] choose a
[1:34:17] messenger to be the messenger of the
[1:34:20] church is with sanctification
[1:34:25] and he couldn't handle his
[1:34:33] wife if you if you go and study Martin
[1:34:36] Luther he was a
[1:34:41] trinitarian he hated the Jewish
[1:34:44] people would you choose a messenger
[1:34:53] he had excuse me when I say that okay
[1:34:56] but it's a reality he had a
[1:34:59] slogan he said in Heaven Is No
[1:35:03] Beer that's why we drink it
[1:35:12] here would you choose it would you
[1:35:16] choose him to be the church a messenger
[1:35:24] I just
[1:35:25] want hey if I I studied a little bit the
[1:35:28] church Edge
[1:35:32] Messengers we know Paul was a model is
[1:35:35] it
[1:35:38] right come on
[1:35:41] church as far as I know Paul was not
[1:35:46] married Martin Luther
[1:35:50] was what I want to show is and brother
[1:35:53] listen he was finding the church a
[1:35:57] mission there go to the book The Church
[1:35:58] a book I I quickly read it we should we
[1:36:01] should have the time brother said I was
[1:36:03] enabled by the Holy Spirit to see
[1:36:07] unfolded the pattern run through
[1:36:11] centuries right into this present day
[1:36:14] amen the key given to me listen to find
[1:36:19] out the
[1:36:22] messengers was not to study the life of
[1:36:25] Paul and to see who is fitting his life
[1:36:31] yeah no
[1:36:34] no come on Church yeah he said I was
[1:36:37] able to determine the messenger for each
[1:36:40] Ace and the key is the most scriptural
[1:36:45] key in fact it might be called hey and I
[1:36:49] jumped I jumped the Keystone of the
[1:36:52] Bible
[1:36:54] that's right it is a
[1:36:57] revelation that God never
[1:37:02] changes oh it's so
[1:37:04] beautiful that his ways are
[1:37:08] unchangeable as he is as it said in
[1:37:11] Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same
[1:37:14] yesterday today and forever so that key
[1:37:17] that God doesn't
[1:37:19] change come on church
[1:37:22] amen he used used to find The
[1:37:29] Messengers if that is the most
[1:37:30] scriptural key oh church we should use
[1:37:33] it
[1:37:35] today to detect the true
[1:37:42] church yes
[1:37:45] yes so don't copy William
[1:37:49] brandham
[1:37:52] am is that okay okay yes sir amen
[1:37:55] hallelujah Martin Luther never tried to
[1:37:58] copy
[1:38:03] Paul it becomes
[1:38:06] better let's go to Matthew guess go to
[1:38:09] Matthew and this is this was to me so
[1:38:13] striking because as we have read God
[1:38:15] cannot change is that right are you not
[1:38:18] happy that there's an unchanging God he
[1:38:20] cannot change he cannot change his mind
[1:38:23] about his word he cannot change his mind
[1:38:26] about you but he can reveal his mind
[1:38:29] about you so God can never change his
[1:38:32] mind about his word but he can reveal
[1:38:35] his mind and looks many times that God
[1:38:39] changes his mind that's right because
[1:38:42] the unveiling is Progressive that's
[1:38:44] right amen you're with me V can never
[1:38:47] change his mind but now he came to
[1:38:49] unveil his mind amen praise God amen
[1:38:55] yes Matthew
[1:38:58] 3:6 uh ma Malachi I'm sorry Mali 3:6
[1:39:02] quickly we we go there and then we we
[1:39:04] try to bundle it up and close
[1:39:08] it the scripture that we really enjoy
[1:39:11] read it with me enjoy it with me for I
[1:39:14] am the Lord and I change
[1:39:17] not therefore the sons of Jacob I'm not
[1:39:21] consumed
[1:39:25] the sons of Jacob are not consumed
[1:39:27] because God is
[1:39:30] unchangeable That's why nothing can
[1:39:32] consume us is that right sons of Jacob
[1:39:36] mean sons of his
[1:39:38] grace That's why nothing can consume the
[1:39:41] sons of his grace because they know God
[1:39:44] is
[1:39:49] unchangeable keep your breath
[1:39:58] in the
[1:39:59] Hebrew the
[1:40:01] word
[1:40:06] change the Bible said I am God and I
[1:40:09] change not is that
[1:40:12] right in the Hebrew Bible the
[1:40:15] word
[1:40:17] change means Shana you can look it up
[1:40:25] which
[1:40:26] means to
[1:40:33] repeat you can look it
[1:40:35] up or to do
[1:40:41] again so the other words God is
[1:40:44] saying I am
[1:40:46] God and I do not repeat
[1:40:51] myself I don't don't do things
[1:40:59] again oh I trust I trust the Lord is
[1:41:03] really is really opening to us what this
[1:41:06] message is amen what this message came
[1:41:10] for that's right this message never came
[1:41:12] to make us copies of
[1:41:14] something but this message came to allow
[1:41:18] us to be who we are right because only
[1:41:21] if we are what we
[1:41:24] are we can unveil what we are sent
[1:41:28] [Applause]
[1:41:30] for that's why no church should try to
[1:41:33] copy another
[1:41:34] church stay the way God Made You Stay
[1:41:37] the way you
[1:41:38] are Hallelujah no family should try to
[1:41:42] copy the other one that's right Paul
[1:41:45] never said copy me he said follow me as
[1:41:48] I follow
[1:41:50] Christ Hallelujah isn't that amazing
[1:41:53] if you watch the church a Messengers you
[1:41:56] wonder what in how in the world would
[1:41:59] the prophet be directed to Martin Luther
[1:42:02] you know by the way next to Martin
[1:42:03] Luther there were so many other Godly
[1:42:08] men yes
[1:42:12] yes Hallelujah but it fell on Martin
[1:42:15] Luther you know why he was a tool yeah
[1:42:19] to
[1:42:20] express justification amen
[1:42:24] that's right in his life yeah yes amen
[1:42:28] that's why when the devil came to him
[1:42:30] and he told him he said hey Luther
[1:42:33] you're drinking too
[1:42:35] much you know Luther said he said if you
[1:42:39] come to blame me that I drink too
[1:42:42] much I take another
[1:42:48] one you understand that I mean we we we
[1:42:51] we we don't what that was his life
[1:42:53] that's right and
[1:42:54] God the prophet was directed to him
[1:42:57] because through his life God could show
[1:43:04] justification he couldn't show it to
[1:43:06] William branham's life but to Martin
[1:43:08] Luther's life yeah yeah he could show
[1:43:12] justification isn't that amazing amen
[1:43:15] see what God how God CHS a certain
[1:43:17] Messengers representing for the age just
[1:43:20] to show more of him yeah
[1:43:23] that's why justification sanctification
[1:43:26] is was never never a copy it was just
[1:43:28] showing more of God baptism of the Holy
[1:43:31] Ghost but there it doesn't stop there it
[1:43:34] doesn't stop no no no no no there it
[1:43:37] doesn't stop it come after just after
[1:43:39] the baptism of the Holy Ghost now he
[1:43:41] comes and the fullness the entire Holy
[1:43:43] Ghost visits the church making God in
[1:43:47] human flesh again sir Hallelujah the
[1:43:51] final man manifestation not in
[1:43:54] lisia sir right but then he called it
[1:43:58] the bright age
[1:44:00] amen
[1:44:02] hallelujah amen oh if we if you really
[1:44:05] have understood him in his ways if you
[1:44:08] really have understood in in his ways as
[1:44:10] as Abraham would recognize him and no we
[1:44:14] we cannot go to Moses that would take
[1:44:15] too long but if you study the life of
[1:44:19] Moses finally at the end of 40 years
[1:44:23] God was tired with
[1:44:25] Israel and God said 40
[1:44:30] years they just know me in my
[1:44:37] acts
[1:44:39] yes how do we know him
[1:44:42] today after so many years the prophet
[1:44:44] left the
[1:44:45] scene how can we identify his
[1:44:49] presence when somebody get healed to
[1:44:51] identify his presence you can can go to
[1:44:53] the
[1:44:54] denominations that's right that's true
[1:44:57] right amen a message had not come for
[1:45:00] this for that that's right amen but as a
[1:45:03] bride of Jesus Christ we should identify
[1:45:05] him now when no one of denomination I
[1:45:08] can identify him because we know him we
[1:45:11] should know
[1:45:13] him in his ways
[1:45:16] now as Abram would have known in his
[1:45:18] ways as William brandham looked there
[1:45:22] and then he said I always thought it is
[1:45:24] him yeah that's right and then he said
[1:45:27] that's him now he's here now amen is
[1:45:31] said that's why he said I can decrease I
[1:45:33] have to decrease and he has to increase
[1:45:35] amen because he is here now how did he
[1:45:37] saw him he saw he you know understand
[1:45:39] that he saw the
[1:45:41] wing God help
[1:45:43] us remember the prophet is telling the
[1:45:45] story of the great day when the when the
[1:45:49] when the when the court is coming
[1:45:51] together and judgment shall be passed
[1:45:53] on
[1:45:54] you okay because of all that you have
[1:45:57] done because of all your sins all your
[1:45:59] blah blah blah judgment will passed and
[1:46:02] then at that day your Advocate Jesus
[1:46:04] Christ has promised you I will never
[1:46:06] leave you or forsake you that's right
[1:46:09] amen and that day the seed where he
[1:46:12] normally sits next to you is
[1:46:15] empty he's not coming he's not there
[1:46:25] the court opens all the people come in
[1:46:28] the white hairs come all
[1:46:30] in the main judge comes in he has a wide
[1:46:34] wig
[1:46:37] onise and so you get very nervous
[1:46:41] because the one that is taking your case
[1:46:44] to plead is not there right
[1:46:49] amen
[1:46:51] church God open our eyes that we
[1:46:54] understand and see him in his
[1:46:57] ways and so the one that don't know the
[1:46:59] scene gets very nervous very nervous so
[1:47:04] the judge is sitting there he's just
[1:47:06] having the you know the wig yeah and
[1:47:10] he's looking in the direction of
[1:47:12] you and he's looking at
[1:47:16] you suddenly you
[1:47:20] realize the mimic
[1:47:24] even as he walked
[1:47:26] in is it he walks like
[1:47:30] my like my Advocate
[1:47:35] amen
[1:47:38] wonder you understand what's going on
[1:47:40] Amen yes sir suddenly as as he looks at
[1:47:45] you he looks at
[1:47:48] you and you realize he said
[1:47:51] what you see his eyes
[1:47:57] blinking suddenly you see
[1:48:00] hey that's him amen right yes sir you
[1:48:04] know what the case is
[1:48:09] finished
[1:48:11] right and you know why the judge had to
[1:48:13] come down you know why the judge had to
[1:48:16] come down in our day and the prophet
[1:48:19] could see the wide wig is that right and
[1:48:21] yet he clearly identify do you see his
[1:48:24] eyes do you see his nose that's him is
[1:48:27] that right that's him but you know why
[1:48:30] you had to come as a judge because the
[1:48:33] advocate can never pass the
[1:48:37] sentence right right is that
[1:48:40] correct only the judge can say you have
[1:48:44] never done it from the
[1:48:48] first is that
[1:48:50] right The Advocate cannot do that amen
[1:48:53] he cannot do that he's pleading for the
[1:48:55] case but only him in judge form can put
[1:48:59] the sentence
[1:49:01] down Hallelujah and as brother randim
[1:49:04] could see him and he said hey the
[1:49:10] characteristic did you
[1:49:12] see the hair is is weak you know angels
[1:49:16] and the prophet said I as I looked at
[1:49:18] the picture he said I always thought hey
[1:49:21] that's
[1:49:23] that's familiar to
[1:49:25] me
[1:49:27] uhuh till God show him told him okay now
[1:49:31] finally we just open it up turn the
[1:49:34] picture and then he said that's
[1:49:37] him that's him with other word Sarah
[1:49:43] listen praise God he's
[1:49:48] here he is here amen hallelujah prise
[1:49:52] God

[1:50:26] difference amen that's why brother

[1:54:39] the fathers to the children and the
[1:54:40] Heart of the children to their fathers
[1:54:42] lest they come to Smite the Earth with a
[1:54:45] curse but you know what goes before that
[1:54:50] Malachi tells you in verse 4
[1:54:54] he said
[1:54:55] remember ye the law of
[1:54:58] Moses my servant which I commanded Tim
[1:55:02] on horb for all Israel with the statutes
[1:55:05] and judgments so Malachi is telling

[1:56:30] desire God's desire not just to unveil
[1:56:34] him in his acts but to unveil him in his
[1:56:37] ways but Israel didn't
[1:56:40] want Israel was just asking for acts

[1:56:49] correct and God said because of that I
[1:56:52] could never show you my ways yeah right
[1:56:57] amen what a lesson we can learn today
[1:57:01] am there's great strengths in seeing God

[1:58:28] Moses could do you could see what
[1:58:29] Abraham could do Abraham knew him in his
[1:58:33] ways that's why Abraham could step in
[1:58:37] and talk to him that's amen and said if
[1:58:40] you find 50 righteous that's 40
[1:58:43] righteous 30 righteous 20 righteous 10
[1:58:46] righteous it became so much that God has
[1:58:49] to turn away from
[1:58:50] Abraham because AB abah would have asked
[1:58:53] further and God could not say no that's
[1:58:56] right God Amen next morning as Abraham
[1:59:01] as as Sodom was to burn and God had went
[1:59:05] away from Abraham because God couldn't
[1:59:07] withstand him is that right that's why
[1:59:09] he moved away from him
[1:59:12] absolutely Hallelujah God knows you am
[1:59:15] that's right amen he knows that he
[1:59:17] cannot withstand you he knows that God
[1:59:21] now don't believe that I know that but
[1:59:24] that's the way it is next morning
[1:59:26] Abraham rose up early in the morning you
[1:59:28] know what Abraham did he went to the
[1:59:30] same place where he stood the day before
[1:59:34] that's right standing in the Gap amen he
[1:59:38] just stood there
[1:59:42] silent when God saw him standing
[1:59:45] there he said
[1:59:47] Angels go get him yeah
[1:59:52] and the Bible said that
[1:59:56] God saved lot because of Abraham
[2:00:02] exactly such an
[2:00:04] impact and you understand how God must
[2:00:07] have enjoyed
[2:00:08] it that's right how God must have
[2:00:11] enjoyed it that's why he enjoyed it to
[2:00:15] listen to Moses when Moses told him
[2:00:18] repent of your evil
[2:00:20] doing the Bible said and God repented of
[2:00:24] his evil
[2:00:25] doing praise God hallelujah what about

[2:03:12] and everyone here this evening to
[2:03:16] believe encourage them this is not the
