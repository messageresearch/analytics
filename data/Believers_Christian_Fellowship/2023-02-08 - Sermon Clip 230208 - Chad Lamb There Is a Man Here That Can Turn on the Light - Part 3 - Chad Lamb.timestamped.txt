[0:00] and this is a a interesting dialogue
[0:03] that brother Benham is having with the
[0:04] Catholic priest because the Catholic
[0:06] said oh God is in his church and we know
[0:09] that's also true
[0:11] is that true God is in his church amen
[0:13] and they're taking a promise to the
[0:15] bride upon themselves falsely so
[0:19] but that's a promise to the bride of
[0:20] Christ a true church that God is in his
[0:23] church amen but what they did with that
[0:25] Revelation is they made themselves the
[0:29] authority of the word and they gave
[0:30] themselves the right to adjust it or
[0:32] change it
[0:34] so they took a true Revelation and by a
[0:37] true Revelation misappropriated amen
[0:40] they lost the guide to the word and they
[0:43] became their own guide and could no
[0:44] longer find the word
[0:46] and why this is so important is because
[0:49] the truth and error are so close they
[0:51] travel on such close lines amen now if
[0:54] we do the same thing the Catholic Church
[0:56] says and say we are the bride we are the
[0:58] word and we start interpreting our own
[1:01] word
[1:02] we'll do the same exact thing the
[1:04] Catholic Church did but this word amen
[1:07] that's been revealed to us through a
[1:08] prophetic ministry will guide us to the
[1:10] light every time we can never become our
[1:13] own guide
[1:16] and to me that's that's where I believe
[1:19] the bride must stay on that Razor's Edge
[1:21] where she is the word for the day amen
[1:24] she she is the Tabernacle of deity
[1:26] absolutely she's the manifestation of
[1:29] the word for this day amen but she can
[1:32] never become her own interpreter of the
[1:34] word amen there's already been the
[1:37] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:39] Vindication through a prophetic Ministry
[1:41] to bring us back to the truth of the
[1:43] Bible amen and that's why it's so
[1:45] important we don't start coming up with
[1:47] our own Revelations
[1:50] amen it's a Catholic spirit
[1:53] and it's dangerous to keep saying we're
[1:55] the bride we're the bride we're the
[1:57] bride amen God gave us one thing to
[2:00] check everything with and that's his
[2:02] Bible
[2:03] amen and we don't take our own
[2:06] interpretation we take the
[2:07] interpretation that's been given to us
[2:09] in this day
[2:10] this ministry
[2:12] praise God but then if we get so
[2:14] self-confident that as if as if
[2:16] everybody in the bride agrees on
[2:19] something will be right that doesn't
[2:20] make it right because you don't know
[2:22] that everybody around you's bride
[2:25] praise God we have to stick with the
[2:28] word
[2:29] so I think this is so super important
[2:32] the day that we live in Deception comes
[2:34] in many ways but it always comes close
[2:36] to the truth
[2:38] we have to stick with the word that's
[2:40] been revealed
[2:42] in our day
