[13:22] our focus is on the real the eternal
[13:25] things
[13:27] that are not seen but are more real than
[13:30] what's seen
[13:33] i'm sorry i'm just a little emotional
[13:34] this morning the lord's just
[13:36] moving over me and i just am released

[14:09] idaho some of you'd say well where's

[14:15] further west than missouri
[14:21] and i just i'm real happy to be out
[14:24] there god sent us there
[14:26] to help a little assembly that was
[14:27] struggling and not that i was anything
[14:29] but
[14:30] i just added my lick of fire with theirs
[14:33] that was to burn
[14:34] and god has been opening his word i
[14:37] believe in the opened word
[14:41] we have a third full ministry that's
[14:43] drawing us into a body change
[14:45] it's a pull and it's a great pull and

[15:22] just thankful to
[15:23] to be here and and to just share
[15:27] share the love that i have and you have
[15:29] for our precious lord
[15:33] and you know the bible said we submit
[15:34] ourselves one to another
[15:38] that's because i have a measure and you
[15:39] have a measure of him
[15:41] and the body is one unit one person
[15:46] and so we are thankful to be assembled
[15:49] with that one person here in our midst
[15:53] and so thankful to for the word of god
[15:55] let's while you're standing
[15:57] turn with me in your bibles to hebrews
[16:01] 10.
[16:01] before i read that i have several
[16:05] scriptures several things the prophet
[16:06] said i don't
[16:08] plan to get to all of it but i may just
[16:10] quote it out instead of reading it
[16:13] i'm not usually one that uses overhead
[16:15] so i'm i'm not used to that once in a
[16:18] blue moon i might use that but
[16:20] but i just uh i'm more used to just the
[16:23] kind of the old way you know i'm getting
[16:25] older
[16:27] and sometimes you don't don't hear quite
[16:31] what you want to hear
[16:32] i mean with these ears and see but i'm
[16:35] just
[16:36] pressing on the upward way amen
[16:41] and so we're thankful and while you're
[16:44] you've turned to that hebrews 10
[16:46] i want to title this this morning and
[16:48] it's a short title but i could make it a
[16:50] long one
[16:51] but it's a short one and it's this come
[16:54] away my love
[16:56] come away my love the time is now
[17:01] to come away our messages
[17:04] come away my love come up higher
[17:09] walk into a dimension you've never
[17:10] walked before
[17:13] amen the prophet said i think that's on
[17:15] the message rising
[17:17] of the sun he said we are or i don't
[17:20] know maybe that wasn't it but he said we
[17:22] are speaking or rapturing up
[17:26] to others we are the bride
[17:29] speaking a rapturing up to others to
[17:31] come into a higher realm than they've
[17:32] ever lived before
[17:34] and so this morning along with this come
[17:37] away my love
[17:39] i want you to know this of course we
[17:42] haven't come here to play church
[17:44] we've come here to meet him you didn't
[17:46] come here to meet me you've come here to
[17:47] meet him
[17:49] and i'm expecting and i'm expecting you
[17:52] to meet him
[17:54] even in greater measure than you've ever
[17:56] met him before
[17:58] and god is calling and i'm talking about
[18:01] right here this morning
[18:02] because we know that under our messenger
[18:04] this bride has become the final voice
[18:07] it's not another voice it's his voice
[18:11] god is calling for your complete
[18:14] perfect submission
[18:19] god is calling for your that's
[18:21] individual
[18:22] talking to you as individuals individual
[18:25] members of himself
[18:28] because your purpose here was to be the
[18:29] revelation of himself
[18:32] it's not another person you're not
[18:34] another person you are himself
[18:36] made manifest and so
[18:39] and that doesn't come through just that
[18:41] doesn't that's not an intellectual thing
[18:43] that comes by the revealing of the word
[18:44] through the word
[18:45] by the hearing of the word and
[18:48] god is calling for your complete
[18:52] perfect submission say is there a is
[18:55] there a possibility of having perfect
[18:57] submission yes sir just as much as the
[18:59] possibility
[19:00] of you walking in perfect faith there is
[19:03] a perfect faith there is a perfect
[19:04] submission
[19:06] amen and
[19:11] and we're calling and knowing
[19:14] in this hour we will get into this and
[19:16] my my meaning for this is not only to
[19:18] call for submission but to show you why
[19:20] you
[19:21] need to submit and show you the hour and
[19:23] the time you're living in
[19:24] to cause you and to say why not why
[19:26] aren't you
[19:27] submitting god is wanting
[19:30] submission complete yielding
[19:33] obedience submission to him and you
[19:37] can't do that in your own intellectual
[19:39] thinking
[19:40] you can't do that in your own
[19:42] intellectual your own carnal self
[19:47] that's why you've got to feed on the
[19:48] open book
[19:51] it's an open book brother sister and
[19:54] it's
[19:54] it's claiming you claiming me
[19:57] in the mystery of that and the mystery
[19:59] of that is the mystery of himself
[20:01] the full mystery of himself revelation
[20:05] 10 7 said the mystery of
[20:06] god would be finished in the days of the
[20:09] voice of the seventh angel the mystery
[20:11] of god would be finished the mystery of
[20:12] god
[20:13] standing here this morning revealed
[20:18] he's calling you to a higher walk he's
[20:20] calling you to come away
[20:22] and submit yourself and rely completely
[20:25] upon him you know that man was made at
[20:27] the beginning to rely completely upon
[20:29] god
[20:30] completely well
[20:34] we're heading right back as it was in
[20:36] the beginning
[20:38] we have to we're being fully restored
[20:40] back to the way of what adam lost
[20:42] we now through the word are obtaining
[20:45] and receiving amen all right
[20:49] so i want to read something out of the
[20:53] church age book and i have several
[20:55] things here the church age book is page
[20:57] 16.
[21:01] he said that the actual revelation this
[21:06] book
[21:06] this revelation is the actual revelation
[21:09] of jesus himself
[21:10] in the church and his work in future
[21:12] ages
[21:13] then i mentioned that it takes the holy
[21:15] spirit to give us revelation or we'll
[21:17] fail to get it
[21:21] bringing these two thoughts together you
[21:23] will see that it won't take just
[21:24] ordinary study and thinking to make this
[21:27] book real
[21:28] it is going to take the operation of the
[21:30] holy ghost that means
[21:31] this book can't be revealed to anyone
[21:34] but a special class of people
[21:37] i believe that special class is here
[21:39] this morning
[21:41] that special class that one that's
[21:43] particular to himself
[21:46] that's his wife that's his bride
[21:50] and it can't be revealed to anyone but a
[21:52] special class of people it will require
[21:54] the ability to hear from god
[21:59] it will require supernatural instruction
[22:05] not just a student comparing verse with
[22:07] verse so that is good or quote with
[22:09] quote
[22:11] but a mystery requires the teaching of
[22:13] the spirit or it never becomes clear
[22:16] how we need to hear from god and lay
[22:18] ourselves
[22:20] open lay ourselves open
[22:28] and become yielded
[22:31] lay ourselves open become yielded to the
[22:33] spirit
[22:34] to hear and know
[22:38] then on on and page 143
[22:42] of this of the this is i'm speaking out
[22:45] of the
[22:45] i say the regular church age book there
[22:48] is another one
[22:49] that i don't know if you're aware
[22:51] brother george had made up okay
[22:53] and it's got different page numbers same
[22:55] wording but just different page
[22:57] different font
[22:58] okay but on page 143 he told us the
[23:02] evidence of what would happen
[23:03] after being baptized with the holy ghost
[23:05] what would what
[23:07] was that we would have the teacher come
[23:10] and
[23:10] teach us all truth but that teacher was
[23:14] an
[23:14] inside teacher not an outside teacher
[23:19] if the holy s if the spirit wasn't
[23:22] inside of you
[23:23] you wouldn't hear the truth and receive
[23:25] it by revelation if you heard it every
[23:27] moment
[23:27] of the day
[23:32] that was the sign of the indwelling
[23:35] spirit in the days
[23:36] of paul those who were filled with the
[23:38] holy ghost heard the word
[23:39] received it and lived by it those who
[23:42] did not have the spirit
[23:43] heard it only as a carnal man put a
[23:46] wrong interpretation on it and went into
[23:48] sin
[23:49] i say in every age the evidence was the
[23:52] same those who had the spirit the
[23:53] teacher
[23:54] heard the word and the spirit in them
[23:56] took the word and taught it
[23:59] revealed it to them that
[24:03] and they were the group that heard the
[24:05] messenger
[24:06] they were the special class of people
[24:08] that heard the messenger
[24:10] and his message and took it and lived it
[24:15] turn with me as i said in hebrews
[24:20] verse our chapter 10 verse 5 wherefore
[24:24] when he cometh into the world he sayeth
[24:26] sacrifice and offering
[24:29] thou woodest not but a body has thou
[24:32] prepared me in song of solomon
[24:40] a body has thou prepared me
[24:46] i'm in that body triumphant
[24:49] amen verse 8 chapter 2 verse 8
[24:53] song of solomon
[25:01] the voice of my beloved
[25:05] behold he cometh
[25:08] i wonder if that's real to you today
[25:11] behold
[25:12] he cometh leaping upon the mountains
[25:16] skipping upon the hills
[25:18] but i want to put emphasis on that verse
[25:20] the voice
[25:22] of my beloved behold he cometh
[25:26] verse 10 my beloved spake
[25:29] and said unto me
[25:32] individual to me not another it was to
[25:35] her
[25:39] rise up my love my fair one
[25:42] and come away rise up my fair one
[25:49] i rise up my love notice how he's
[25:51] identifying
[25:53] her in the same love
[25:56] my love who is she she's
[25:59] his love amen he is love
[26:04] who is she she is love
[26:09] amen rise up my love
[26:12] she's his love manifested
[26:17] rise up my love my fair one and come
[26:19] away
[26:20] then we'll then for lo the winter is
[26:23] past notice i want you to notice the
[26:25] time
[26:26] the time
[26:30] elohim spoke to abraham and sarah and
[26:32] said i'm going to visit i'm going to
[26:33] keep my promise and visit you
[26:35] this is genesis 18. in the time of life
[26:39] i will return in the time of life

[27:16] figs and the vines with the tender grape

[27:48] opening of the rock

[27:56] opening of the revelation
[27:59] rock is revelation the opening of the

[28:51] verse 22
[28:56] wives submit yourselves
[28:59] unto your own husbands as
[29:02] unto the lord
[29:07] notice as unto the lord paul is showing
[29:11] here
[29:13] a natural type and we'll get to it here
[29:15] he's
[29:16] pointing to christ and his bride
[29:21] he said wives submit yourselves unto
[29:24] your own husbands as unto the lord
[29:28] let me before i go any further let me
[29:31] just give you the
[29:32] the definition here of submission and
[29:34] submit
[29:35] submission is the action or fact of
[29:38] accepting or yielding
[29:41] to a superior force or to the will or
[29:44] authority
[29:45] of another person
[29:48] to submit is to yield resign or
[29:51] surrender to the power
[29:53] will or authority of another
[29:59] as we just read wives submit yourselves
[30:02] to your own husbands
[30:04] to be subject to acquise in the
[30:07] authority of another
[30:09] to thy husband's will to be submissive
[30:13] to yield without murmuring
[30:16] amen to yield without murmuring
[30:22] what's the scripture say for it is god
[30:23] which worketh in you both to will
[30:25] and to do of his good pleasure
[30:29] and this says
[30:33] without murmuring and let me just i just
[30:35] had that come let me just back off i
[30:37] just don't have to turn to it here let
[30:38] me just turn over here
[30:39] just a moment to philippians
[30:46] and read that as it would be would be
[30:49] read here
[30:50] for it is god which worketh in you this
[30:52] is 2 13
[30:53] which worketh in you both to will and to
[30:56] do of his good pleasure
[30:57] do all things without murmurings and
[31:02] disputings
[31:04] you may be blameless and harmless the
[31:06] sons of god without rebuke in the midst
[31:08] of a crooked and perverse nation among
[31:10] whom you
[31:10] shine as lights in the world
[31:14] holding forth the word of life
[31:17] that i may rejoice in the day of christ
[31:20] that i have not run in vain neither
[31:23] labored
[31:23] in vain amen
[31:27] verse 23 for the husband is the head of
[31:30] the wife
[31:31] even as christ is the head of the church
[31:34] and he is the savior of the body
[31:37] therefore as the church is subject
[31:39] unto christ so let the wives be to their
[31:41] own husbands
[31:42] in everything i want you to catch the
[31:44] spiritual context in this
[31:46] husbands love your wives even as christ
[31:48] loved the church and gave himself for it
[31:51] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[31:53] with the washing of the water by
[31:56] the word that he might present
[32:00] it to himself a glorious church
[32:03] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[32:06] thing but that it should be holy
[32:08] and without blemish so ought men to love
[32:12] their wives
[32:14] as their own bodies
[32:17] who is christ's body
[32:21] you are christ's body so
[32:25] ought men to love their wives as
[32:28] their own bodies
[32:33] that for no man ever yet hated his own
[32:37] flesh
[32:38] now this will come in more view as we go
[32:40] a little further here
[32:42] for we for no man ever yet hated his own
[32:44] flesh
[32:45] even as the lord the even as
[32:48] the lord the church even as the lord the
[32:51] church
[32:52] the lord doesn't hate his own flesh
[32:56] the lord doesn't hate his own body
[32:59] even as the lord the church all right
[33:06] for we are members of his body
[33:10] of his flesh and of his bones
[33:13] we are members of what his body
[33:17] right of his flesh and of his bones
[33:21] for this cause shall a man leave father
[33:23] mother and shall be joined
[33:26] unto his wife and they too shall be
[33:29] one flesh this is a great mystery
[33:33] but i speak concerning christ and the
[33:36] church
[33:39] amen
[33:48] in john 11. let me just read one more
[33:52] here and before we
[33:54] move on john 11 first john i'm sorry i
[33:57] know it's saint john 11.
[34:13] jesus is at the grave of lazarus
[34:17] and martha meets him and said if thou
[34:20] had been here my brother would not have
[34:22] died
[34:24] but i know that even now whatsoever you
[34:27] shall ask god god will giveth thee
[34:29] that's the 22nd verse 23rd jesus said
[34:31] unto her thy brother shall rise again
[34:34] martha said unto him i know that he
[34:35] shall rise in the resurrection last day
[34:37] jesus said unto her i
[34:38] am the resurrection i am the
[34:41] resurrection
[34:44] i am the life he
[34:48] that believeth in me
[34:51] he that believeth in me when were you
[34:53] believing in him
[34:57] you didn't all of a sudden become a
[34:58] believer in him you always were in him
[35:02] i'm coming in the more of these things
[35:03] and i said i'll read a lot of quotes now
[35:05] you forgive me if that
[35:06] is too much for you but i i just got to
[35:09] follow what the lord wants me to bring
[35:11] here
[35:12] and you just look beyond the man and let
[35:14] god speak to you
[35:15] through it amen
[35:19] and so we know that he's the he just
[35:20] said i am the resurrection and the life
[35:22] how many believe that
[35:25] he said i am the resurrection of the
[35:27] life well who's the bride
[35:30] she's the same life and she is the
[35:33] resurrection
[35:34] because it was the resurrection that was
[35:36] and what a resurrection this is
[35:40] is that right all right so he says
[35:45] he that believeth in me though he were
[35:47] dead yet shall he live
[35:50] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[35:51] shall never die believe it sounds this
[35:53] you remember what the prophet said
[35:54] because i live you live also
[35:58] then we say again that what a
[35:59] resurrection that was but what a
[36:01] resurrection this
[36:02] is to see that christ unveiled in you
[36:06] raised you have raised you did raise
[36:08] with him
[36:09] and now a manifested son and daughter of
[36:12] god
[36:14] risen in this day by the word
[36:18] a resurrection because he come to you
[36:22] personally amen you say yes he did he
[36:27] came to me he came to me through a
[36:28] prophet he came to me yes and he comes
[36:30] to you through his bride he comes to you
[36:31] through his body
[36:33] life comes through the body
[36:37] what life eternal life what's the
[36:40] greater works to impart life
[36:42] is that right what is the greater works
[36:44] we are here to bring the great
[36:45] with the revelation of what we are and
[36:48] that we can do the greater works
[36:50] now watch this same thing played out
[36:52] right here he said and whosoever liveth
[36:54] and believeth in me
[36:55] in me shall never die
[37:00] now that ought to be enough right there
[37:01] enough we've read right there to cause
[37:03] you to surrender completely to him
[37:08] is that right what i'm bringing here is
[37:11] a lot of things you say what's i got to
[37:12] do is submission everything
[37:13] because when you see your day and your
[37:15] hour and your position and yourself
[37:17] manifested in that day and hour that
[37:20] being the mystery revealed that's enough
[37:22] to submit yourself to him
[37:25] and we should bring a complete
[37:27] submission
[37:29] you say oh i've got this outside well
[37:30] this isn't you this isn't what you
[37:32] contact god with right here
[37:34] what you contact god with is through his
[37:36] faith he's imparted his faith in you
[37:39] what is the victory that overcometh the
[37:41] world even our faith
[37:43] is that right our faith who is what
[37:46] god's own faith
[37:49] whatsoever is born of god overcometh the
[37:51] world
[37:52] and this is the victory that overcometh
[37:55] the world
[37:55] even our revelation of himself
[37:59] in us being who we are
[38:04] amen see the veil's been opened if the
[38:06] book hadn't been opened you are the full
[38:08] complete revelation of jesus christ
[38:11] yourself he's not complete without you
[38:14] the book has been opened to reveal
[38:16] himself completely
[38:19] amen the full revelation of jesus christ
[38:23] is the bride hallelujah
[38:28] amen amen all right that's a powerful
[38:31] statement brother david it is but it's
[38:33] the word for the season
[38:36] all right so we and whatsoever whosoever
[38:39] believeth and believeth in me shall
[38:41] never die believeth thou this
[38:43] he said she saith them yay lord i
[38:45] believe that thou art the christ the son
[38:47] of god
[38:48] which should come into the world and
[38:50] when she had
[38:51] so said she went her way
[38:56] and called mary
[39:00] her sister openly
[39:05] secretly didn't call her openly
[39:08] not everybody knew it she went to her
[39:11] personally
[39:12] and spoke to her what was speaking same
[39:16] voice that said come
[39:17] rise come away
[39:20] all right here is the voice here
[39:23] speaking coin
[39:24] going to mary her sister secretly saying
[39:26] the master is come
[39:29] hello the master is come
[39:35] and calleth for thee
[39:39] i pray that you can see that personally
[39:41] this morning
[39:42] the master has come and is calling for
[39:46] thee
[39:49] amen not calling for everybody he's
[39:51] calling for you
[39:54] he's not calling for the public he's
[39:55] calling you out of the public
[39:57] he's not calling to a denominational
[39:59] spirit church he's calling you out of it
[40:01] he's not calling he's calling you into
[40:03] his own self
[40:05] into his presence into the reality of
[40:07] your position
[40:08] and to see yourself positionally placed
[40:11] in him
[40:16] all right so he called her she went away
[40:18] and she called her
[40:20] to master his calling for thee and as
[40:23] soon as
[40:24] she heard that
[40:27] she rose quickly and came unto him she
[40:30] submitted to that word
[40:33] is that right she she surrendered
[40:37] this who's calling me my i
[40:40] i will come immediately she rose up and
[40:44] went to him
[40:46] hallelujah hallelujah all right
[40:51] the bible said in psalm 68 33 he does
[40:54] send out his voice in that a mighty
[40:55] voice
[40:57] amen all right so so this
[41:03] and this submission then
[41:06] your submission submissive to him
[41:11] is by love it's not a make-believe
[41:15] submission
[41:16] well i'll just i'll pro i'll just i
[41:19] don't really mean
[41:20] to but i'll just be i'll do it anyway no
[41:22] no
[41:23] no it's not that kind of submission
[41:25] we're not talking about that submission
[41:27] we're talking about a submission by love
[41:29] this is this isn't by love you loved him
[41:33] he loved you
[41:34] he loved you he first loved you
[41:38] amen that's why you love him and
[41:42] love will call will bring trust
[41:45] trust is submission what is this word
[41:48] it's a pure word his word is pure word
[41:52] it's a perfect word the bible said in
[41:54] psalms 18 his way is perfect
[41:57] is that right and write down two verses
[42:00] and he said and he has made your way
[42:02] perfect
[42:04] why is your way perfect because you're
[42:06] in him
[42:08] if his way is perfect your way can't be
[42:10] anything but perfect
[42:11] what are you going to do submit to that
[42:13] word
[42:15] well i can't figure it out i feel this
[42:16] and i feel that i reason this and i see
[42:18] this
[42:18] that doesn't have a thing to do with it
[42:20] what's the word say
[42:22] you take the word take him at his word
[42:24] the word will have to do what he said he
[42:25] would do
[42:28] it's submission amen he's calling for
[42:32] submission a greater submission
[42:36] all right so
[42:41] now when you obtain this message now the
[42:43] marriage is come how many say amen
[42:45] revelation 19 7 let us be glad and
[42:46] rejoice
[42:47] for the marriage is come let me just
[42:50] read something to you the prophet said
[42:52] over here
[42:53] in the message proving his word this has
[42:54] been read many many times by many many
[42:56] preachers
[42:57] and it's nothing new but it's new but to
[42:59] me every time you read something
[43:01] god's always right there in it and it's
[43:03] brand new
[43:05] all right because it's an eternal word i
[43:07] believe that the
[43:09] the ministry the message of this hour is
[43:11] an eternal word message
[43:16] amen because it's the word of god
[43:19] it's the correct interpretation of the
[43:22] word of god for this season
[43:24] we don't have a right to add to that and
[43:25] take away from it if you add to what he
[43:27] said and take away from it you aren't
[43:29] submitted
[43:32] you are surrendered to your reasoning
[43:35] you're surrendered to your feelings
[43:37] you're not you're submissive to that
[43:39] you're bowing to that
[43:41] frankly that's idolatry
[43:45] a spirit of it i'm not calling you
[43:48] idolaters but the spirit of it anything
[43:50] that comes between you
[43:51] and god which is the word that you would
[43:55] bow to
[43:55] over the word as an idolatrous spirit
[43:59] amen a lot could be said on that but
[44:03] anyway all right
[44:08] we see the voice of our beloved
[44:13] is the voice of our head
[44:16] amen where does that voice manifest
[44:19] itself through the body
[44:22] all right so let us go a little further
[44:25] here
[44:26] in the message there on proving is
[44:29] proving
[44:30] his word paragraph 235 236
[44:34] is it okay if i just take my liberty and
[44:36] read a little bit i know
[44:37] i know that uh you know it's just the
[44:40] lord has his way
[44:41] he knows exactly what you need
[44:43] individually
[44:46] like i said i i have these things here
[44:48] and probably they're about
[44:49] 10 sermons in one but that's the way it
[44:53] is
[44:56] all right now
[44:59] we say he's raised from the dead i
[45:01] didn't say it the word said it
[45:05] amen they said he raised from the dead
[45:07] he said
[45:08] he says he's the same yesterday today
[45:10] and forever
[45:13] you believe that he promised these
[45:15] things to happen in the last days
[45:17] that the same son of man will be made
[45:20] manifest
[45:23] same son of man all right
[45:26] now remember that was not jesus talking
[45:29] to abraham there
[45:31] in genesis 18. that was not jesus
[45:33] talking to abraham there
[45:35] that could discern the thoughts of
[45:37] sarah's mind behind him that was not
[45:39] jesus the man
[45:40] are you with me okay the man jesus
[45:44] that was not jesus he had not yet been
[45:47] born
[45:47] but it was a man in human flesh
[45:53] amen all right it was a man in human
[45:56] flesh
[45:56] that abraham called elohim the great
[45:59] almighty showing jesus said
[46:01] as it was in the days of sodom now watch
[46:03] close
[46:04] in the days of sodom so will it be in
[46:06] the coming of the son of man
[46:08] when the son of man is being revealed
[46:10] revealed as
[46:12] unveiled all right
[46:16] not no more as a church see he turned
[46:19] the corner
[46:19] it's not no more as a church not no more
[46:22] as a church see not no more
[46:24] the bride is called
[46:29] the bride is called see in that day the
[46:31] son
[46:32] in that day the son of man will be
[46:35] revealed
[46:36] what he said what to join the church to
[46:39] the head
[46:42] amen now the prophet said we must lay in
[46:44] the presence of this son
[46:46] those that he said the thing what's the
[46:49] matter with the message today is those
[46:50] who obtain it in their hearts now this
[46:52] is spoken way back in 65
[46:54] i believe we're up on the line here way
[46:56] up here i believe
[46:57] i believe that with all my heart there's
[46:59] been many laying in the presence of the
[47:01] sun
[47:02] are you with me it's not talking about
[47:04] infancy so much anymore we're coming
[47:06] into maturity
[47:07] [Music]
[47:08] and what is that maturity himself
[47:13] all right so see said now
[47:20] he said those that obtain that message
[47:22] in their hearts must lay in the presence
[47:24] of the sun to get ripened
[47:27] so who's the message what's the message
[47:28] and what's ripening
[47:31] amen are you with me remember the
[47:34] ministry of the
[47:35] bride is the same ministry of the groom
[47:40] not another ministry it's the same
[47:41] ministry
[47:44] all right so he said he said
[47:49] we've got to lay in the presence that
[47:50] you can pick up the message
[47:52] and then let the sun bake all the
[47:54] greenness out of you see making matured
[47:56] christians
[47:58] this is the end amen
[48:01] this is the end the wheat has come back
[48:03] to the wheat again
[48:05] the word has come back to the full word
[48:07] again the revelation has come back the
[48:09] son of man to the son of man again
[48:12] only in bride form
[48:16] what stumbles the people is the form he
[48:18] comes in
[48:19] it's not another person it's the same
[48:21] person
[48:24] hallelujah if the bride would be another
[48:26] person she wouldn't be his wife
[48:30] she wouldn't be bride because this bride
[48:33] i'm coming into it and back in the
[48:34] church aces again
[48:36] showing where you were before the
[48:38] foundation of the world
[48:40] that ought to be enough to surrender
[48:42] that ought to be enough to submit
[48:43] yourself
[48:47] after we get through here i trust that
[48:50] god will show you
[48:51] what it means to submit yourself to the
[48:53] promised word for the season
[48:55] that you see your hour in your time
[48:59] and the and the time that he promised it
[49:01] would be here
[49:02] it's not publicly known everywhere it's
[49:04] known to his people his bride
[49:06] they're the only ones that could receive
[49:08] it
[49:10] i don't say who's this bride this is
[49:12] bright it isn't bride i'm just glad the
[49:14] revelation of us in my soul
[49:18] but i am united with the people that
[49:20] know he's the same today
[49:22] as he was yesterday not another person
[49:26] she's not another person
[49:29] she is him in another form
[49:33] because it was always in him
[49:37] to be bride
[49:41] hallelujah all right so so you see we're
[49:46] we just this is the end the wheat's back
[49:48] to wheat the seeds back to the seed
[49:51] whatever started in the beginning has
[49:52] come back to itself again
[49:55] the shucks dried up
[49:58] life's moved out of the shock
[50:01] it's back to himself again back to this
[50:05] ministry of himself back to the full
[50:07] revelation of himself
[50:09] [Applause]
[50:11] in another form what for
[50:14] for a rapture for a body change
[50:21] hallelujah and you've got to have that
[50:23] change
[50:24] or you'll never be changed
[50:27] you've got to turn the corner you've got
[50:29] to be changed yourself it's an
[50:31] inside of the inside bringing the
[50:33] outside under obedience
[50:34] in fact it'll get so full on the outside
[50:36] you'll change
[50:40] hallelujah that's what's happening
[50:45] that's what's taking place that's why
[50:48] the bride just can't get enough of this

[54:10] i in you where's his temple where's his
[54:12] dwelling place where's his body
[54:16] it's you

[54:22] he sanctified a church that he himself
[54:24] could come and dwell in is that right
[54:30] amen he himself he comes to do what
[54:33] quicken that
[54:34] seed pour himself into you
[54:39] baptize you with the holy spirit
[54:41] baptizes that word baptizes that seed
[54:44] a true spiritual birth of the word
[54:48] amen amen and if
[54:51] and if he's the birth of the word
[54:53] there's no other place of worship but
[54:54] where he put his name
[54:56] and upon this rock i'll build my church
[54:58] upon this revelation
[55:00] of who i am then the new birth is a
[55:02] revelation of jesus christ in you
[55:05] then who are you you are that birth
[55:14] that's right you are that birth word
[55:19] amen amen amen why not submit
[55:25] amen and i'd say that to the bride
[55:27] knowing she will
[55:29] she has to but it's her will to do it
[55:35] she makes the choice because he made the
[55:37] choice
[55:38] you make the right choice because he
[55:39] made the right choice
[55:43] amen see i have a choice you do
[55:47] right amen but you'll never come to deny
[55:50] that word
[55:51] because you always was that word
[55:57] when he expressed himself he expressed
[55:59] you when you come face to face with him
[56:01] you come face to face with yourself
[56:04] all right so in that day you'll know
[56:07] that i'm in my father my you and me and
[56:09] i in you
[56:10] it's the same thing over in saint john
[56:12] 15 7.
[56:13] he said if you abide in me and my words
[56:16] abide in you
[56:17] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[56:19] be done brother branham in perfect faith
[56:21] said
[56:21] quote of this scripture he said if you
[56:23] abide in me and my words in you
[56:25] then you know who you are
[56:29] all right he said here the bridegroom
[56:32] will come right down
[56:34] the bride the the son of man will be
[56:36] revealed what for
[56:37] to join the church to the head unite the
[56:40] marriage
[56:41] of the bride the bridegroom call will
[56:44] come right through this
[56:47] when the son of man will come down
[56:50] amen uniting it's a union
[56:54] coming down union uniting with the body
[56:59] who is this our lord up there quickening
[57:01] power then let you see his coming what
[57:03] for
[57:04] he's in union with a bride
[57:10] amen satan hates this kind of preaching
[57:14] he fights this because he can't stand
[57:16] against the word
[57:18] when you know who you are there's no way
[57:21] he can take you out of that
[57:23] when your habitation is christ he can't
[57:25] reach his hand in
[57:26] and take you out you're sealed in
[57:31] he can't touch you
[57:35] he can't touch you the spirit of god
[57:37] that's in you
[57:40] did you get that who's the real you
[57:43] the spirit of god that's in you
[57:48] your enemy is dead you reckon him dead
[57:52] every day
[57:54] he's defeated you're fighting a defeated
[57:56] enemy
[57:57] but you're fighting to prove the word
[58:01] amen this eve won't fall like that eve
[58:04] did
[58:04] this this woman here won't fall this
[58:06] wife won't fall like she did
[58:08] is that right
[58:12] why she's predestinated not to she's for
[58:14] ordained not to
[58:16] she can't she never will but he's
[58:22] proving to satan
[58:24] that this word that he said and spoken
[58:27] is being manifested
[58:29] and therefore you have the answer to his
[58:32] devil's question it's not me that liveth
[58:35] that's
[58:36] christ in me
[58:39] not david him
[58:42] i in him he and me
[58:46] all right i kind of got ahead of myself
[58:49] a little bit there
[58:51] all right so what's he doing to join the
[58:54] church to the head
[58:54] unite the marriage of the bride the
[58:56] bridegroom call
[58:58] will come right through this
[59:02] the bridegroom call will come right
[59:04] through what
[59:06] this message this unveiling
[59:09] of himself that bridegroom call will
[59:12] come right through this
[59:15] when the son of man will come down and
[59:17] come in human flesh
[59:19] to unite the two together the church has
[59:22] to be the word
[59:23] he is the word and the two unites
[59:25] together and to do that
[59:27] it'll take the manifestation of the
[59:29] revealing of the son of man
[59:33] not a clergyman do you see what i mean
[59:35] it's the son of man jesus christ
[59:38] will come right we'll come down in human
[59:40] flesh among us
[59:41] and we'll make his word so real that
[59:44] will unite the church and him as one
[59:47] so the head and the body are becoming
[59:49] one
[59:50] unit the head and the body are united
[59:52] together they're no longer twain
[59:54] they're one amen
[59:59] i got quotes on this you want me to read
[1:00:01] it
[1:00:03] but you know what he said that christ
[1:00:04] the mystery of god revealed
[1:00:07] they are becoming one amen
[1:00:14] we know that she's not another person
[1:00:17] she's the she's him
[1:00:21] the headship and the body he said what
[1:00:24] is it not them people
[1:00:26] the headship and the body has become one
[1:00:28] unit
[1:00:30] it's god manifested in his people
[1:00:33] that's the reason the husband and wife
[1:00:35] is no longer twain
[1:00:37] they're one why marriage has come
[1:00:46] they're one god in his church is one he
[1:00:49] didn't point punches with that he wasn't
[1:00:52] just saying things to be saying it
[1:00:55] god and his church is one christ in you
[1:00:57] god's great revelation
[1:01:02] christ in you god's great revelation
[1:01:08] glory to god even bearing his name
[1:01:12] pregnation
[1:01:16] hallelujah are you with me all right
[1:01:19] there's a union
[1:01:20] that's taken place is taking place
[1:01:24] amen and you have the token to prove it
[1:01:29] get into that a little bit here all
[1:01:31] right now
[1:01:34] you see jesus christ the son of man will
[1:01:37] come right down in human flesh among us
[1:01:39] and will make his word so real
[1:01:41] it will unite the church and him as one
[1:01:43] the bride
[1:01:44] he said he corrected it unite the church
[1:01:46] and he said the bride
[1:01:48] and they'll go home to the wedding
[1:01:50] supper
[1:01:52] because the marriage of the lamb is cuz
[1:01:55] cause the marriage of the lamb
[1:01:57] has come
[1:02:03] amen where are we heading to the
[1:02:06] marriage
[1:02:06] the wedding the marriage supper amen we
[1:02:09] on yet we are feasting
[1:02:13] we are in a feast what is it the
[1:02:16] unveiling
[1:02:18] of himself it's a seven course meal
[1:02:22] it's a revealing of himself amen
[1:02:26] amen that was only reserved for his
[1:02:29] people his bride
[1:02:31] amen amen she'll go home to the wedding
[1:02:35] supper she's already
[1:02:36] so you see then she's already she's been
[1:02:38] already united see we go to the wedding
[1:02:40] supper not to the marriage
[1:02:42] because the marriage of the lamb has
[1:02:43] come but the rapture is going to the
[1:02:45] wedding supper
[1:02:47] when the rat when the word here unites
[1:02:49] with the person
[1:02:50] and they too become one then what does
[1:02:53] it do then it manifests
[1:02:54] the son of man again
[1:02:59] not the church theologians the son of
[1:03:01] man the word
[1:03:02] and the church becomes one whatever the
[1:03:04] son of man done
[1:03:05] he was the word the church does the same
[1:03:08] thing
[1:03:09] amen amen what is she she's himself
[1:03:13] she's his character
[1:03:14] she's his life she's himself
[1:03:18] manifested here in this hour
[1:03:22] holding forth the word of god
[1:03:27] his word this is my husband's word
[1:03:31] i have to wonder about the word it'll
[1:03:33] it'll do exactly what he said he would
[1:03:35] do
[1:03:36] amen you have an absolute
[1:03:41] a perfect absolute you just take him at
[1:03:44] his word
[1:03:45] settle in your in your mind it's
[1:03:47] finished
[1:03:48] settle in your heart it's done and go on
[1:03:55] amen all right
[1:03:59] now
[1:04:02] i want to go over here to
[1:04:06] to isaiah 22 22 and lay these things in
[1:04:09] then come over
[1:04:10] to another spot here now the bible said
[1:04:14] that this this unveiling
[1:04:18] well let's go to luke 17 just a moment
[1:04:20] before we
[1:04:23] go to that spot luke 17.
[1:04:33] these are very familiar scriptures but
[1:04:35] no matter and i'm thankful they are
[1:04:38] familiar
[1:04:42] verse 20 and when he was demanded
[1:04:45] interesting
[1:04:46] of the pharisees when the kingdom of god
[1:04:48] would should come he answered in them
[1:04:50] and said
[1:04:51] the kingdom of god cometh not with
[1:04:54] observation
[1:04:56] and you look that observation of course
[1:04:58] that's an outward show
[1:05:01] this revelation is not known to the
[1:05:03] public if
[1:05:04] because he doesn't marry the public he
[1:05:07] marries a bride
[1:05:08] out of the public come away
[1:05:12] all right see he's right he come
[1:05:15] when he come riding into the city of
[1:05:17] jerusalem
[1:05:19] riding into the city
[1:05:22] you know that's what the city is
[1:05:25] he come riding at the city there were
[1:05:27] those that were
[1:05:29] hated him most of them brother brahm
[1:05:31] said hated him
[1:05:32] challenged him and there was those that
[1:05:34] didn't know what to do the middle and
[1:05:35] then there was those that loved him
[1:05:38] looked for him knew him they saw him
[1:05:41] they know exactly who was coming in
[1:05:45] they saw him ride in that right
[1:05:49] i wonder if we've seen him right in
[1:05:53] amen all right so he saw him right in
[1:05:57] and they and they said well but she knew
[1:05:59] the bride knew who it was
[1:06:01] we'll we'll get back to that i'll just
[1:06:03] stop right there with that
[1:06:04] luke 17 again the kingdom of god cometh
[1:06:06] not with observation
[1:06:08] of course you say observation everybody
[1:06:10] knew it but not everybody didn't know it
[1:06:12] everybody knew there was a man come
[1:06:14] riding in but they didn't know who it
[1:06:15] was everybody saw the
[1:06:17] everybody almost everybody saw the
[1:06:18] picture of the cloud ring but they
[1:06:20] didn't know who it was
[1:06:24] amen is that right they didn't know what
[1:06:26] it meant or what it stood for
[1:06:32] you see it's not a public
[1:06:36] show all right
[1:06:40] now he said
[1:06:44] the kingdom of god cometh not with
[1:06:46] observation neither shall they say low
[1:06:47] here or lo there
[1:06:51] like say we spend a lot of time on these
[1:06:52] words for behold the kingdom of god
[1:06:56] the word made spirit the word made power
[1:06:59] the word unveiled in you is within you
[1:07:04] you are the kingdom of god you are his
[1:07:08] eternal possession
[1:07:10] okay we'll come back to that i want you
[1:07:12] to go with me isaiah
[1:07:13] 22 22.
[1:07:17] this is a a verse that brother branham
[1:07:19] took
[1:07:20] i think it was submergent church age
[1:07:23] reading that there went back to in
[1:07:26] isaiah
[1:07:34] and brings it up and i want to bring
[1:07:35] that out this morning
[1:07:37] under this message
[1:07:46] and it says and the key of the house
[1:07:49] of david now
[1:07:52] when i gave this title as i said the
[1:07:56] time
[1:07:57] come away my love it's and it's at an
[1:07:58] appointed time this marriage this
[1:08:00] appointed time this union
[1:08:04] as it referred back to genesis 18.
[1:08:07] and i want to also put this subject in
[1:08:11] as we
[1:08:12] turn into this
[1:08:15] the key to his house
[1:08:20] the key to his house
[1:08:24] the key also to your house
[1:08:30] now i saw that sounds strange but we'll
[1:08:33] understand that in just a minute
[1:08:36] this submission that god's calling for
[1:08:38] is a complete submission it's also
[1:08:40] subjection and separation
[1:08:44] a submission to his word is separating
[1:08:46] to him alone
[1:08:48] it's a separation to his word alone no
[1:08:50] matter what other things come whether
[1:08:52] it's feelings whether it's people's
[1:08:53] ideas people's thoughts
[1:08:55] you're separated to him alone
[1:08:59] he's the word that's your husband all
[1:09:02] right now
[1:09:03] and i and the key watch and the key of
[1:09:07] the house of david
[1:09:08] of course david was a king he was a king
[1:09:10] over the house
[1:09:12] he was and i will i lay the key of the
[1:09:15] house of david
[1:09:16] will i lay upon his
[1:09:20] shoulder so he
[1:09:24] shall open and none
[1:09:27] shall shut i just love that
[1:09:31] he shall open and none shall shut
[1:09:35] and he shall shut and none
[1:09:38] shall open
[1:09:43] i want to go back to what the prophet
[1:09:44] spoke of this
[1:09:46] in the church ages
[1:09:49] what he said of this
[1:09:54] and you'll find it if you're wanting the
[1:09:56] page number you'll find this on 295 296.
[1:10:04] now it says in isaiah 22 22 and the key
[1:10:07] of the house of david will i lay upon
[1:10:10] his shoulder
[1:10:12] so he shall open and none shall shut
[1:10:15] and he shall shut and none
[1:10:18] shall open the spirit
[1:10:22] uses this old testament reference
[1:10:25] concerning the lord jesus christ and his
[1:10:28] ministry in the church
[1:10:35] what the key of david signified at that
[1:10:38] time is mere
[1:10:38] shadow which is now fulfilled
[1:10:42] in jesus standing in the midst of the
[1:10:45] lamp stands
[1:10:47] it has to do with our lord after
[1:10:51] his resurrection and not his earthly
[1:10:54] pilgrimage
[1:10:56] but what does this key signify
[1:11:00] the answer lays in the position
[1:11:05] of the key it is not in his hand
[1:11:08] it is not worn around his neck it is not
[1:11:11] placed in the hands of
[1:11:13] other men
[1:11:20] or the verse could not be saying that he
[1:11:22] alone has the use of that key
[1:11:25] for he alone opens and shuts
[1:11:30] and no man has that right but jesus
[1:11:33] himself
[1:11:39] isn't that right he says but
[1:11:42] where is the key it is on his shoulder
[1:11:46] but what does shoulder have to do with
[1:11:48] it isaiah 9
[1:11:49] 6 and the government shall be upon his
[1:11:52] shoulder but what does in the government
[1:11:55] the government
[1:11:56] shall be upon his shoulder
[1:12:01] what does this mean the answer is this
[1:12:04] listen carefully the answer is this
[1:12:09] this the phrase government upon his
[1:12:11] shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony
[1:12:16] of the east you see our wedding ceremony
[1:12:19] is a little backwards
[1:12:21] i won't go into all that detail i think
[1:12:23] you've probably
[1:12:24] heard that spoken here and what it is in
[1:12:27] the east
[1:12:30] but it comes from the wedding ceremony
[1:12:32] of the east
[1:12:35] i just love the way the prophet brings
[1:12:37] things back and brings a restoration
[1:12:40] forth okay it comes from the east
[1:12:43] when the bride has been committed to the
[1:12:46] groom
[1:12:48] amen when the bride has been committed
[1:12:52] to the groom
[1:12:56] she takes off her veil
[1:13:00] remember my subject here she takes off
[1:13:03] her veil
[1:13:05] and places it over the groom's shoulders
[1:13:11] what's that signifying it's signifying
[1:13:13] that not only
[1:13:14] is she under his dominion
[1:13:20] amen all right under his dominion
[1:13:24] she has transferred

[1:29:10] your thinking or your
[1:29:11] or your i mean it's okay if it agrees

[1:29:45] going to have testing of trial
[1:29:47] but it's just to prove the word
[1:29:50] it's a love affair
[1:29:54] and of course that is misunderstood love
[1:29:59] amen but it's true love you go through
[1:30:02] tiles and testings and struggles that
[1:30:04] mean you have struggles they didn't know
[1:30:05] what it was when jesus said let us go to
[1:30:07] the other side
[1:30:09] i didn't know he'd meet the wind in the
[1:30:10] middle of it
[1:30:13] but he was there he's right here
[1:30:16] he's right there he's right in you he's
[1:30:18] in the ship
[1:30:20] amen oh you just get fearful over the
[1:30:24] waves and everything and all this and
[1:30:26] no no reason to be fearful he said we're
[1:30:27] going to the other side
[1:30:30] is that right and he got the evidence of
[1:30:33] it in the ship
[1:30:37] it's not some idea it's a substance

[1:31:41] another another
[1:31:43] nature here that's warring against that
[1:31:46] submission
[1:31:48] but which is greater greater is he
[1:31:51] outwardly no greater is he that is
[1:31:54] in you than he that is in the world
[1:31:58] is that right then what are we judging

[1:33:37] have come through the blood
[1:33:40] that the veil has been broken
[1:33:44] and you see him face to face
[1:33:47] amen if i when i see the blood
[1:33:53] i will pass over you amen
[1:33:57] all right that token
[1:34:01] is the requirement of the hour
[1:34:05] god requires it the only thing he'll
[1:34:08] recognize
[1:34:09] is that you've come in union with him
[1:34:14] when you know you've come in union with
[1:34:16] him you you had to go
[1:34:18] into him to come in union you had to lay
[1:34:21] in his presence
[1:34:22] he was pouring himself out of himself
[1:34:24] into you
[1:34:26] they are becoming one amen
[1:34:30] all right now let's
[1:34:33] just see here
[1:34:36] talking about under that submission i'd
[1:34:38] like you to go to first corinthians 7
[1:34:41] 4. and before i
[1:34:44] go that much further there i want to
[1:34:47] read something
[1:34:50] and let's let's go to first corinthians
[1:34:52] six it's and then
[1:34:54] go right into seven first corinthians
[1:34:58] six
[1:35:03] and just before that
[1:35:07] let me read something brother branham on
[1:35:08] questions and answers 1964.
[1:35:12] the question is
[1:35:21] i can't give over completely to jesus
[1:35:25] have i an evil spirit he said let me
[1:35:28] spend the rest of the time on that you
[1:35:30] can't surrender to jesus
[1:35:32] i don't know if it's man or woman i
[1:35:33] couldn't tell what it is god knows that
[1:35:35] you can't surrender to jesus
[1:35:36] why what's the matter if you're a woman
[1:35:40] don't you have to surrender to your
[1:35:41] husband to be a wife
[1:35:43] surrender all you are a little lady when
[1:35:45] you're married virtuous fought all your
[1:35:47] life to stay virtuous but one day
[1:35:49] you found a man that you loved you were
[1:35:51] his completely
[1:35:53] the things that you fought against all
[1:35:55] your life and tried to live clean and
[1:35:57] clear and virtuous now you surrender
[1:35:59] every bit of it to one man
[1:36:01] is that right but you you put yourself
[1:36:04] completely in his hands
[1:36:06] you are his all that you have stood for
[1:36:09] in decency
[1:36:10] and moral and everything like that now
[1:36:12] you turn over to
[1:36:13] a man because you surrender yourself to
[1:36:16] the man
[1:36:17] can't you do the same thing to jesus
[1:36:19] christ
[1:36:21] just surrender yourself that way all
[1:36:23] that i am
[1:36:24] all my mind all my thoughts certainly
[1:36:27] i don't think you're possessed of an
[1:36:29] evil spirit i think that evil spirit
[1:36:31] anoints you with them kind of thoughts
[1:36:33] trying to make you think you cannot
[1:36:34] surrender yourself to god
[1:36:36] but let me show you something why would
[1:36:38] you want to surrender to him
[1:36:40] because there's something out there
[1:36:41] calling you to surrender
[1:36:43] so she had the desires or he or she had
[1:36:46] the desire
[1:36:48] it's not just the enemy trying to anoint
[1:36:50] you thinking you can't
[1:36:51] you wouldn't have the desire to do it
[1:36:54] that's
[1:36:54] it i hope that helps somebody
[1:36:58] all right trying to make you so you
[1:37:00] can't survive because there's something
[1:37:01] in your calling to surrender it's a very
[1:37:02] good sign that you ought to surrender
[1:37:04] yourself
[1:37:05] amen now in a message and i don't
[1:37:08] remember the name of the message but
[1:37:09] listen to this statement
[1:37:11] what a beautiful thing this is the
[1:37:13] prophet speaking what a beautiful thing
[1:37:14] it is to just
[1:37:15] lay your life in his hands and say here
[1:37:18] am i
[1:37:18] lord here am i
[1:37:22] lord just use me now lead me and guide
[1:37:25] me and direct me in the way that would
[1:37:27] be pleasing
[1:37:28] unto thee and then don't murmur
[1:37:34] no matter what the path is stay with it
[1:37:37] anyhow
[1:37:38] i like that you've committed you believe
[1:37:41] what you've done
[1:37:43] you let go you know god answers
[1:37:46] god moves in radical ways to our
[1:37:49] thinking
[1:37:50] man's thinking he moves in unusual ways
[1:37:53] ways that don't seem reasonable to our
[1:37:55] thinking
[1:37:56] but his way is perfect amen
[1:37:59] and when and when you surrender yourself
[1:38:02] like that and give himself wholly over
[1:38:04] to him
[1:38:05] then he answers many times in an
[1:38:07] unexpected place in an unexpected way in
[1:38:09] an unexpected time
[1:38:11] but he answers he'll always do it he has
[1:38:13] to keep his word
[1:38:16] see your word is your absolute
[1:38:19] amen all right
[1:38:22] so don't murmur no matter what the path
[1:38:25] is you stay with it anyhow and god will
[1:38:27] work it out
[1:38:28] all right the footsteps of the righteous
[1:38:31] is
[1:38:31] ordered of the lord all right
[1:38:35] now let me go back over here to first
[1:38:39] corinthians 6
[1:38:40] 13 meets for the belly and the belly for
[1:38:42] meats but god shall destroy both it
[1:38:44] and them now the body is not for
[1:38:47] fornication but the
[1:38:49] but the lord are you with me
[1:38:53] i'm making little points here because
[1:38:54] i'm going to come to a point in chapter
[1:38:56] 7.
[1:38:58] now the body is not for fornication but
[1:39:01] who's it for
[1:39:02] the lord and the lord for the body
[1:39:10] i had something over here too that i
[1:39:13] wanted to bring in here let me see
[1:39:22] yeah her body this is brother brown
[1:39:25] speaking in the message invisible union
[1:39:26] her body
[1:39:28] her body which is for the lord
[1:39:31] are you with me her body you know
[1:39:34] brother brahm speaking that message went
[1:39:36] natural but he's bringing in spiritual
[1:39:38] all the time
[1:39:39] all right so her body is given to her as
[1:39:42] or other words we could say his body
[1:39:46] are you still with me okay okay
[1:39:49] so i'm taking of your body too all right
[1:39:53] we find that her body is the betting
[1:39:55] grounds
[1:39:58] remember he said it's not a public show
[1:40:00] it's an inside the the the kingdom of
[1:40:02] god is within you
[1:40:05] brother branham said that he beds
[1:40:07] himself in you
[1:40:10] amen he's bedded him he bedded he bedded
[1:40:13] himself in you
[1:40:16] okay
[1:40:19] i could get that for you but i'll just i
[1:40:21] know where that is
[1:40:23] he said
[1:40:27] let me just find that because somebody
[1:40:29] might be saying that what
[1:40:31] where do you find that he said let me
[1:40:33] just see if i can't find that real quick
[1:40:39] he bedded himself
[1:40:49] okay
[1:41:08] i'm sorry just a moment
[1:41:16] um
[1:41:24] well did me just read where i was now
[1:41:27] her body
[1:41:28] is given to her a sacred trust from god
[1:41:29] the reason it's so sacred is to bring
[1:41:31] forth life
[1:41:32] into the earth her body is the betting
[1:41:35] ground of life
[1:41:36] therefore that's the reason she is given
[1:41:38] this sacred trust
[1:41:40] are you with me bride notice now we find
[1:41:43] that her body
[1:41:45] his body is the betting grounds and
[1:41:46] therefore it is a sacred trust not to
[1:41:49] defile that
[1:41:51] now i'm speaking now bringing that to an
[1:41:54] illustration to show you where the
[1:41:55] church
[1:41:56] stands amen
[1:41:59] what he said it went from luther through
[1:42:01] wesley into pentecost
[1:42:04] now into the capstone that's what
[1:42:06] followed
[1:42:07] the capstone and the church and the word
[1:42:09] become the same
[1:42:11] same thing exactly perfectly
[1:42:14] amen brother braham said when perfect
[1:42:17] word unites with perfect word
[1:42:20] said perfect word with perfect word i've
[1:42:23] got all these things and it's just
[1:42:25] i just i just don't have time to get him
[1:42:27] on but it's all
[1:42:28] perfect word now notice it's a betting
[1:42:30] ground your body
[1:42:32] is given to him
[1:42:35] amen for a betting ground of his life
[1:42:39] he beds in that amen
[1:42:43] he beds in that body
[1:42:50] well i just can't find that i'd i'll
[1:42:53] probably run across it all right now
[1:43:01] now in in going on in our reading know
[1:43:03] you not that your bodies are the members
[1:43:05] of christ
[1:43:06] shall i then take the members of christ
[1:43:08] and make them the members of a harlot
[1:43:10] god forbid
[1:43:11] know you not that that which is joined
[1:43:13] unto a harlot is one body
[1:43:15] the two saith he shall be one flesh but
[1:43:17] he
[1:43:18] that is joined unto the lord is one
[1:43:21] spirit
[1:43:23] amen now let's go on down here
[1:43:27] to verse 19. what know you not that your
[1:43:30] body
[1:43:30] is the temple of the holy ghost
[1:43:34] which is in you what is your body it's
[1:43:37] his
[1:43:39] it's his dwelling place know you not
[1:43:41] that your body is the temple and where
[1:43:42] does god dwell he dwells in his word
[1:43:46] is not your body the temple of the holy
[1:43:48] ghost which is in you and you have
[1:43:50] of god and you are not your own for you
[1:43:53] are bought with a price therefore
[1:43:54] glorify god in your body
[1:43:56] and in your spirit in your body and in
[1:43:59] your spirit which are
[1:44:01] gods amen
[1:44:04] all right
[1:44:09] we see the headship in the body has
[1:44:11] become one unit as god manifested in his
[1:44:13] people that's the reason husband and
[1:44:15] wife is no longer twain
[1:44:16] all right now
[1:44:19] amen
[1:44:24] now verse chapter 7 verse 3
[1:44:28] let the husband render unto the wife
[1:44:32] do benevolence that word benevolence let
[1:44:35] me get that
[1:44:36] here that word benevolence means
[1:44:42] do respect
[1:44:45] do kindness giving what is due
[1:44:49] well intentioned giving what is due
[1:44:53] well-intentioned kindly respect
[1:44:58] and it says render
[1:45:02] let the husband render render means to
[1:45:05] submit
[1:45:06] let the husband submit
[1:45:09] let the husband let the husband render
[1:45:12] submit
[1:45:13] give in give in return
[1:45:17] amen so let the husband or let the
[1:45:20] menace both husband and wife here let
[1:45:22] the husband render unto the wife do
[1:45:24] benevolence
[1:45:25] and likewise also the wife render
[1:45:28] unto the husband do benevolence now you
[1:45:32] say well this is speaking of a husband
[1:45:33] and wife yes it is but let's go beyond
[1:45:35] that a minute
[1:45:37] let's go beyond it into the spiritual
[1:45:40] side of this
[1:45:42] amen you know every every
[1:45:46] scripture brother brahm said has a
[1:45:48] compound meaning
[1:45:50] nearly he said every scripture has a
[1:45:52] compound meaning and a compound
[1:45:54] revelation
[1:45:56] and so he said so the wife
[1:45:59] now verse seven the wife
[1:46:03] hath not power that word power is
[1:46:05] authority
[1:46:06] or authority over the wife hath not
[1:46:10] power of her own body
[1:46:12] but the husband
[1:46:15] amen the power the wife has not
[1:46:17] authority over her own body
[1:46:19] but the husband and
[1:46:23] likewise also the husband hath not
[1:46:27] power over his own body
[1:46:31] unless the wife gives it to him
[1:46:36] i said that for a reason
[1:46:39] he said unless the wife he has not power
[1:46:42] of his own body but the wife
[1:46:46] unless the wife submits
[1:46:50] to him how can he have authority
[1:46:55] over his body
[1:46:58] amen are you with me how can he have
[1:47:00] authority over his body
[1:47:03] she he has no power over his
[1:47:06] now his body who is his body
[1:47:09] amen and who is her body
[1:47:13] who is her body where she dwells
[1:47:17] where she's where she's dwelling where
[1:47:19] this is naturally say well that's
[1:47:20] natural but i'm going to the spiritual
[1:47:22] now
[1:47:23] brother brown said if you see you if
[1:47:26] i've watched another room and i'm in
[1:47:27] this room and you say me and my husband
[1:47:29] me and my wife
[1:47:30] my husband and i or my wife and i are
[1:47:32] one but brother branham said but christ
[1:47:34] and his church are one but he said it's
[1:47:36] not that kind of one
[1:47:38] are you with me you don't you see me but
[1:47:41] you don't see my wife but the jesus said
[1:47:43] when you see me you see my wife
[1:47:45] or when you see when you see my wife you
[1:47:47] see me
[1:47:48] because she's him she's both dynamics
[1:47:51] and mechanics
[1:47:52] she's him she's the word living she's
[1:47:55] him
[1:47:56] and he's her if you say she is him then
[1:47:59] he must be her
[1:48:02] amen are you with me so we look at this
[1:48:05] scripture here
[1:48:06] and i may just close on this rest of
[1:48:08] this i have so much i just gotta
[1:48:10] but look at here
[1:48:13] the wife has not authority of her own
[1:48:15] body
[1:48:16] her own body is his body is that right
[1:48:20] and the husband has no authority over
[1:48:21] his body
[1:48:24] amen except the wife gives it to her
[1:48:27] so the wife has to give her him
[1:48:29] authority so what is it
[1:48:31] she gives him the key to his house
[1:48:36] are you with me and he in turn by that
[1:48:39] submission
[1:48:40] gives her the key to her house
[1:48:46] and if you have the key to your house
[1:48:48] and you know who your house is
[1:48:49] then you have the benefit of everything
[1:48:51] he is
[1:48:53] are you with me all right
[1:48:58] did
[1:49:00] so so so defraud don't don't cheat one
[1:49:04] another see
[1:49:05] unless it's consent for a time there is
[1:49:08] a time
[1:49:09] you give your time what has been through
[1:49:11] these seven ages time of laying in the
[1:49:13] presence coming up through luther coming
[1:49:15] up through wesley
[1:49:16] coming up through pentecost but there
[1:49:18] come a time
[1:49:20] there come a time when there would be a
[1:49:22] union made there come a time
[1:49:24] when the marriage had to come this is
[1:49:26] seed time
[1:49:28] this is bride time this is marriage time
[1:49:32] they become one you lay your veil upon
[1:49:35] his shoulders
[1:49:37] there's never been a day like this day
[1:49:39] brother bam said there's never been a
[1:49:40] day like this
[1:49:41] he said christ in you makes you the
[1:49:43] complete revelation of the whole thing
[1:49:44] do you see where we're at look at here
[1:49:47] now let me go back here
[1:49:49] and pick up something he said there also
[1:49:51] he said
[1:49:52] you see where we're at he said
[1:49:55] and another message i got to got two
[1:49:56] messages here i have to go
[1:49:58] going back and forth on but watch
[1:50:04] watch here now he said he said there's a
[1:50:06] seed time there's something coming here
[1:50:08] he said in matthew 25 and brother
[1:50:10] branham brother branham speaking of the
[1:50:12] foolish virgin
[1:50:16] uh he said here he said
[1:50:21] he said what are these what are these
[1:50:22] chur what are these what is this shock
[1:50:24] what is this
[1:50:25] denominational thing trying to do out
[1:50:27] here well they say we need speakers with
[1:50:30] tongues we need divine healers we
[1:50:31] and brother brown said they're calling
[1:50:33] for a uh they're calling for a revival
[1:50:35] they're calling for revival
[1:50:36] they're calling for a prophet and they
[1:50:38] have not recognized he said the
[1:50:40] awakening of the bride
[1:50:44] they're they're calling for a great
[1:50:45] awakening they're calling for a great
[1:50:47] thing to come
[1:50:48] and they've not missed what's that
[1:50:50] they've missed what's come
[1:50:52] could it be they're missing what's come
[1:50:58] because he doesn't come publicly
[1:51:02] amen are you with me that's the that's
[1:51:05] the unwritten word but it's no longer
[1:51:07] unwritten to us
[1:51:08] because we found words written
[1:51:12] it's no longer unwritten to us that
[1:51:14] unwritten word of revelation 10 and that
[1:51:16] mystery of that book that john was
[1:51:17] forbidden to write
[1:51:18] why he said but the day's the voice of
[1:51:20] the seventh angel that mystery would be
[1:51:21] revealed
[1:51:24] and it couldn't come until the seventh
[1:51:26] the one that had the seventh seal step
[1:51:28] forth
[1:51:29] are you with me till that mighty angel
[1:51:32] which manifests unveiled himself in a
[1:51:33] prophet
[1:51:36] amen and spoke to his bride very
[1:51:38] directly very profoundly
[1:51:40] and said come away this is your
[1:51:43] resurrection this is your time
[1:51:46] this is your season marriage has come

[1:51:53] and we're proceeding in that right now
[1:51:56] we're not marching downward we're
[1:51:58] marching upward
[1:52:00] right and step with the word for the
[1:52:02] season if you have a word out of season
[1:52:05] then it's out of season then the blood
[1:52:07] isn't applied correctly
[1:52:10] amen but when you have a word in season
[1:52:12] then the word comes in its season
[1:52:14] and europe because you're promised to be
[1:52:16] in this season and you're a spoken word

[1:52:32] with you and it would be one person
[1:52:37] amen amen your headship is within you
[1:52:44] the the rock has been revealed
[1:52:48] amen it's a rock beneath the rock
[1:52:52] unveiled in you personally you hold that
[1:52:56] revelation

[1:53:00] christ
[1:53:01] the mystery revealed

[1:53:09] paragraph 151 now but in this day
[1:53:13] we've had organization denomination we
[1:53:16] see where they are
[1:53:16] the nations are we see the day the
[1:53:18] promise is fulfilled let me get back
[1:53:20] this quote
[1:53:21] said what are these people trying to do

[1:54:59] to come
[1:55:00] but now i keep wanting to go back there
[1:55:03] that's the end time seed sign he said

[1:55:18] she foolish virgin without oil

[1:55:24] takes the dynamics upon the mechanics
[1:55:27] oh she had the word i'm talking about
[1:55:30] the word now watch what i'm saying she
[1:55:32] had but she lacked revelation
[1:55:35] she lacked the holy spirit she lacked
[1:55:37] oil i say she had the word
[1:55:39] intellectually
[1:55:42] amen are you with me all right she she
[1:55:45] come up under that she come up why sure
[1:55:46] i believe a prophet sure i believe his
[1:55:48] message
[1:55:49] but never had a revelation of it all
[1:55:52] right
[1:55:52] she was trying to get the revelation
[1:55:55] trying to search trying to get it trying
[1:55:56] to buy oil
[1:55:58] all right now but watch he said
[1:56:02] there come a so he said now she was
[1:56:04] locked out
[1:56:05] oh he said brother brown said oh what a
[1:56:07] wonderful day we're living in
[1:56:10] what a wonderful day we're living in he
[1:56:12] said you say you call that a wonderful
[1:56:15] day
[1:56:15] yeah it's a wonderful day we're living
[1:56:17] in
[1:56:19] he says now the church will come through
[1:56:21] justification through luther through
[1:56:23] sanctification through wesley
[1:56:24] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:56:26] the pentecostals and go
[1:56:28] right on in into the perfection
[1:56:31] of the son of man capstone okay
[1:56:36] perfection the son of man when the
[1:56:37] husband and wife will be the same self
[1:56:39] person
[1:56:41] god will be so manifested into his bride
[1:56:44] his church till they will both
[1:56:45] be the same they are one he says now
[1:56:48] you see where we're at
[1:56:52] now you see where we're at all right now
[1:56:56] let me go back here the day this
[1:56:57] scripture is fulfilled that's a powerful
[1:56:59] little message i love that message
[1:57:01] he says now but in this day
[1:57:04] now he said in this day there is to come
[1:57:08] a super
[1:57:09] royal seed of abraham that's exactly
[1:57:12] what it would be
[1:57:13] would be a royal bride to the royal
[1:57:16] promised son
[1:57:19] as i spoke last night it won't be a
[1:57:21] natural seed it'll be a spiritual seed
[1:57:24] there is to be a spiritual bride raise
[1:57:26] up which will be the royal seed of the
[1:57:28] royal faith of abraham's royal son
[1:57:31] she's to come on the scene in the last
[1:57:33] days and the time and the place
[1:57:35] is a promise given
[1:57:39] to her amen amen amen
[1:57:43] and we can go through those promises and
[1:57:45] scriptures which we do
[1:57:47] amen but who do you say this is
[1:57:52] it's our lord up there but it's our lord
[1:57:54] in here
[1:57:58] amen who's he united what's he come to
[1:58:01] do
[1:58:02] unite invisible union
[1:58:05] all right so
[1:58:09] getting back to that you see that that
[1:58:13] seventh chapter there of
[1:58:16] or verse four and so there come an
[1:58:19] appointed time there come a time
[1:58:23] there come a time there was for a time
[1:58:26] with prayer and and fasting but there
[1:58:29] come a time
[1:58:30] when the bridegroom come in the midst
[1:58:33] how can the how can the children fast
[1:58:35] when the bridegroom's here
[1:58:37] are you with me you see what i'm trying
[1:58:39] to get across here now
[1:58:40] see see so he said and that's okay
[1:58:43] that's
[1:58:44] physical that's you should be in the
[1:58:45] word there's a time i'm not
[1:58:47] i'm not i'm not denouncing any of that
[1:58:49] at all what brother paul was saying here
[1:58:51] but just like romans 7
[1:58:52] brother branham said when he preached
[1:58:54] invisible union now this speaks you'd
[1:58:56] think of
[1:58:56] of of a marriage in divorce but he said
[1:58:59] it's deeper than that
[1:59:00] right this is deeper than this there's
[1:59:03] some
[1:59:04] because paul even said i speak
[1:59:05] concerning christ in the church
[1:59:07] in ephesians 5. there was a deeper
[1:59:10] subject there was a deeper reality was
[1:59:12] showing us here see in that scripture
[1:59:15] amen i show you a great mystery
[1:59:18] we are bone of his bone flesh of his
[1:59:19] flesh and the word today is becoming
[1:59:22] flesh and the flesh is becoming the word
[1:59:24] that's why when christ is in you it
[1:59:26] makes you the complete
[1:59:29] revelation of the whole thing now we see
[1:59:32] the promise being fulfilled
[1:59:35] now we see the promise being fulfilled
[1:59:38] christ
[1:59:39] the true headship going in
[1:59:42] coming in coming in
[1:59:46] going in coming in hello
[1:59:50] do you see the promise being fulfilled
[1:59:53] this day this day
[1:59:56] i'm fulfilling scripture this day
[2:00:00] this scripture is being fulfilled now we
[2:00:02] see the promise brother branham was
[2:00:04] making it very clear
[2:00:05] this promise is being fulfilled there
[2:00:07] has to be a promised word there must be
[2:00:09] a bride there must be one
[2:00:11] there must be those two must come
[2:00:13] together see
[2:00:14] they've got to be one you see her you
[2:00:17] see him
[2:00:18] you see him you see her what is it
[2:00:21] what is what is that from submission
[2:00:25] when you submit to him he gives you the
[2:00:27] key to to
[2:00:28] to his house to your house your house
[2:00:33] your house everything he has
[2:00:36] in your house in everything you have in
[2:00:39] your house
[2:00:40] because he's your house you see no cut
[2:00:43] no plague can come now you're dwelling
[2:00:49] because he's the dwelling
[2:00:54] you're in him
[2:00:57] you're in him go back to psalm 91 see if
[2:01:00] if it's not
[2:01:00] he's not our habitation he is our
[2:01:03] habitation
[2:01:05] is that right we we dwell in him
[2:01:08] he and us now you know who you are
[2:01:12] now you see the day in your hour you're
[2:01:14] living here
[2:01:15] now you see the resurrection message now
[2:01:18] you hear the
[2:01:19] voice of the resurrection arise my love
[2:01:23] come away let's stand i'm going to stop
[2:01:27] right there
[2:01:28] i can a lot more weak go on and i
[2:01:31] probably miss things and i'll probably
[2:01:32] get home and look at oh i wish i said
[2:01:34] that
[2:01:34] i wish i'd have said that can i just
[2:01:37] take one little matter
[2:01:39] while you're standing just to change
[2:01:41] there's one place i have to come to
[2:01:44] and that's page 149 onward for about
[2:01:47] three pages
[2:01:51] i thought you were done brother david i
[2:01:53] was until god reminded me
[2:01:55] all right that's the truth
[2:02:00] remember i was going to go back to pick
[2:02:02] up your pen and write
[2:02:04] but just keep this in mind he now works
[2:02:06] in
[2:02:07] and through his bride
[2:02:12] he now works in and through his pride
[2:02:14] and she knows that
[2:02:16] amen and when she knows that she submits
[2:02:19] to him
[2:02:21] amen all right he now works in and
[2:02:24] through his bride
[2:02:27] for it was not yet time for him to do
[2:02:28] certain things that he must now do
[2:02:31] but he will now fulfill through the
[2:02:33] bride the work that he's left for this
[2:02:35] specific time
[2:02:38] amen the bride can only do his will she
[2:02:41] does nothing else you can't make them do
[2:02:43] otherwise
[2:02:44] they have saith the lord or keep still
[2:02:47] they know that it has to be god in them
[2:02:49] doing the works
[2:02:51] now a lot could be said the secret is
[2:02:53] the words in the bride amen
[2:02:55] amen oh my
[2:02:59] amen and the harmony that's to exist
[2:03:01] amen that's another sermon
[2:03:04] still the same one but another one
[2:03:08] i'd say we could make a lot of parts out
[2:03:09] of this all right
[2:03:12] but there is one place i want to get to
[2:03:14] and that's that's
[2:03:15] uh page 149
[2:03:19] and on a little bit there let me listen
[2:03:22] carefully and i don't know why god kept
[2:03:24] this to the last because i had it at the
[2:03:26] first
[2:03:28] but as we quoted before st john is it
[2:03:30] okay if i just go a little bit
[2:03:33] might just be seated again we'll keep
[2:03:35] you standing
[2:03:36] you see that's unusual for a preacher to
[2:03:38] do that no it really isn't
[2:03:43] most of them would just keep you
[2:03:44] standing
[2:03:46] but listen i want you to catch this let
[2:03:49] me just end with these things
[2:03:51] and this ought to solidify it right here
[2:03:58] what's submission how to submit what to
[2:04:00] do
[2:04:01] you have not chosen me but i've chosen
[2:04:03] you
[2:04:06] now brother i'm going to steal your
[2:04:09] thunder
[2:04:10] a little bit because
[2:04:14] we were talking about this and i i just
[2:04:17] had to bring this in so we're just gonna
[2:04:19] have to
[2:04:20] okay now it's a quote brother brother
[2:04:23] chad probably knows where i'm going with
[2:04:24] this
[2:04:25] the purpose of god according to election
[2:04:28] romans 9 11 said it it says the purpose
[2:04:31] of god according to election
[2:04:33] might stand you can't read it any other
[2:04:36] way the heart
[2:04:36] purpose i just love this
[2:04:40] the heart purpose the eternal
[2:04:43] purpose you were brought here on the
[2:04:46] earth
[2:04:47] under an eternal purpose did you know
[2:04:48] that
[2:04:50] you were chosen in him before the
[2:04:53] foundation of the world
[2:04:54] you think the devil's going to come and
[2:04:56] take you out of him now
[2:04:58] you were chosen in him
[2:05:02] amen and it and he's purposed your walk
[2:05:06] and your
[2:05:06] calling and your positioning in the body
[2:05:08] he purposed it
[2:05:11] but the heart purpose i don't want to
[2:05:12] get to preach on this let me just read
[2:05:14] okay
[2:05:15] you're still pulling the heart purpose
[2:05:17] the eternal purpose of god
[2:05:22] i just could take his focus on that
[2:05:24] statement
[2:05:25] was to take a bride here's the read
[2:05:27] here's what it was
[2:05:28] was to take a bride of his own choosing
[2:05:31] and that purpose was in himself
[2:05:35] and that purpose was in himself being
[2:05:38] eternal
[2:05:40] being eternal himself being eternal was
[2:05:43] decreed before the foundation of the
[2:05:45] world
[2:05:46] now watch carefully now and see this
[2:05:48] before there was ever a speck of
[2:05:50] stardust
[2:05:51] before god was god god is an object of
[2:05:53] war adoration and no one was there to
[2:05:56] worship him
[2:05:57] so he so he was at that time only
[2:06:01] potentially god you'll have to excuse me
[2:06:03] my
[2:06:04] when i preach my nose runs
[2:06:16] i hope that's not turn the mic down
[2:06:19] brother
[2:06:19] okay he did good all right now turn it
[2:06:23] up
[2:06:24] okay now
[2:06:29] watch carefully see he was at that time
[2:06:34] before god was god god is an object of
[2:06:36] adoration worship
[2:06:38] and be and and and before that he and he
[2:06:41] was at that time
[2:06:42] only potentially god he was known only
[2:06:46] as
[2:06:46] eternal spirit
[2:06:49] the bride was already in his mind
[2:06:55] the bride was already in his mind yes
[2:06:58] she was
[2:06:59] she was existing she was existing
[2:07:05] in his thoughts and what about
[2:07:09] those thoughts of god notice what
[2:07:12] it's the thoughts of
[2:07:16] this bride existing in his thoughts was
[2:07:19] in the mind of god and those
[2:07:20] thoughts of god
[2:07:23] thoughts of god now god has thoughts
[2:07:27] he's all kind he knows all things but he
[2:07:30] has thoughts of himself
[2:07:33] eternal thoughts all right
[2:07:37] okay and so and what god
[2:07:41] and what about those thoughts of god
[2:07:43] they are eternal are they not
[2:07:47] the eternal thoughts of god
[2:07:50] now he identifies what he's talking
[2:07:52] about here the eternal thoughts of god
[2:07:55] let me ask you are the thoughts of god
[2:07:57] eternal
[2:07:58] he said if you can see this you will see
[2:08:01] many things
[2:08:03] god is unchangeable in both essence
[2:08:06] and behavior oh my
[2:08:09] and he's going to have a bride of his
[2:08:11] own character
[2:08:13] she's going to be him we have studied
[2:08:15] that and when you wonder why you go
[2:08:17] through testings and trials
[2:08:19] he's bringing out his character we have
[2:08:22] studied that and proven that already god
[2:08:24] is
[2:08:24] infinite in his ability so therefore god
[2:08:28] he is as god must be omniscient
[2:08:31] he's omniscient he is now learning he is
[2:08:34] not now learning nor has taken counsel
[2:08:36] even with himself
[2:08:37] nor is he at any time adding to his
[2:08:40] knowledge
[2:08:41] he can add to it he if he can add to his
[2:08:44] knowledge then he is not omniscient
[2:08:47] the best we could say is that sometime
[2:08:50] he will be
[2:08:50] but not that is not scriptural he is
[2:08:53] omniscient he has never had a new
[2:08:56] thought
[2:08:57] amen he never had a new thought about
[2:09:00] you
[2:09:02] all right but about he's never had a new
[2:09:05] thought about anything because all his
[2:09:07] thoughts he has always had and always
[2:09:09] will have
[2:09:11] and all of his thoughts he has always
[2:09:14] had and always will have
[2:09:20] and now and knows the end from the
[2:09:22] beginning because he's god
[2:09:25] thus the thoughts of god are eternal
[2:09:32] they are real they are not simply a man
[2:09:35] with blueprint
[2:09:37] that he is he is not simply a man with a
[2:09:39] blueprint he has drawn up which one day
[2:09:41] will be translated into substance and
[2:09:43] form
[2:09:44] but they are already real and eternal
[2:09:46] and part of god now i'm going to skip
[2:09:48] down
[2:09:49] here
[2:09:56] now it says he hath though he had chosen
[2:09:59] us in him
[2:10:00] remember the heart purpose the very
[2:10:02] heart purpose of god
[2:10:04] was to have a bride that was already
[2:10:07] existing in his thoughts of himself
[2:10:10] so those thoughts of the bride are
[2:10:13] eternal
[2:10:15] all right now it says he had chosen us
[2:10:18] in him
[2:10:19] before the foundation of the world that
[2:10:21] means that we were right with him
[2:10:23] in the mind and thoughts of god before
[2:10:25] the foundation of the world
[2:10:27] that gives that that gives an eternal
[2:10:29] quality
[2:10:30] to the elect you can't get away from
[2:10:32] that
[2:10:33] but let us go on these elect were not
[2:10:36] only the eternal thoughts of god
[2:10:39] now notice what he said the elect were
[2:10:41] the eternal thoughts of god not only
[2:10:43] were they the eternal thoughts of god
[2:10:45] which were you'd realize you're the
[2:10:47] eternal thoughts
[2:10:48] of god
[2:10:52] so god can't be complete without those
[2:10:54] thoughts being manifested
[2:10:57] made made substance made tangible
[2:11:02] all right these elect were not only the
[2:11:04] eternal thoughts of god which would be
[2:11:06] expressed in flesh
[2:11:08] which were to be expressed in flesh
[2:11:11] in their due season here we are
[2:11:16] but these same elect are called by
[2:11:18] another name what is it he said
[2:11:19] therefore it is of faith that it be by
[2:11:22] grace
[2:11:23] that the end of the promise might be
[2:11:24] made sure to all the seed
[2:11:26] not only to that which is of the law but
[2:11:28] that which is of faith of abraham
[2:11:31] all right amen
[2:11:35] now and if you be in christ
[2:11:39] you are abraham's seed and heirs
[2:11:42] according to the promise
[2:11:47] amen now i mean just skipping forward
[2:11:50] here save time
[2:11:57] these who are of the royal seed are the
[2:12:00] elect of god
[2:12:02] the predestinated fore known of god and
[2:12:04] we're in the mind of god
[2:12:06] and in his thoughts in very plain
[2:12:08] language the true bride of christ
[2:12:10] was in the mind of god eternally
[2:12:13] though not expressed until each came
[2:12:15] forth in the
[2:12:16] designated decreed season as each member
[2:12:20] came forth it became expressed amen
[2:12:23] it became expressed a spoken thought
[2:12:27] what was the message to do it was
[2:12:30] expression
[2:12:32] speaking you into existence all right
[2:12:36] okay thus the true bride was in the mind
[2:12:39] of god eternally though not expressed
[2:12:41] until each came forth in the
[2:12:42] designated decreed season as each member
[2:12:45] came forth it became expressed and took
[2:12:47] its place
[2:12:47] in the body thus this bride
[2:12:51] is the literal spoken word original seed
[2:12:55] remember
[2:12:56] thus this bride is the literal spoken
[2:12:59] word seed bride
[2:13:02] and though she is feminine designation
[2:13:04] she's called the body
[2:13:06] of christ she was predestinated in him

[2:13:12] with him

[2:21:27] hid
[2:21:28] we're not looking through a veil we're
[2:21:29] not looking through a glass darkly
[2:21:32] we see as he sees us
[2:21:36] we all with open face beholding is in a
[2:21:38] glass that's like a mirror the mirror
[2:21:40] the glory we're beholding the glory of

[2:22:52] [Applause]
[2:22:53] [Music]
[2:23:01] [Applause]
[2:23:02] visions
[2:23:05] [Music]
[2:23:16] from
[2:23:20] [Music]
[2:23:26] whispers of love
[2:23:29] [Music]

[2:23:37] [Music]
[2:23:40] praising my savior
[2:23:43] [Music]
[2:23:50] this is my story
[2:23:55] this is my song
[2:24:00] praising my savior
[2:24:05] all the day long
[2:24:10] hallelujah how many want to submit
[2:24:14] everything you have i want more than
[2:24:16] ever just to submit to him
[2:24:18] i was so edified by the word this
[2:24:20] morning
[2:24:22] and when he said sit back down i said
[2:24:24] amen
[2:24:25] i don't ever get to sit and feed you
[2:24:27] know i didn't ever want it to end
[2:24:29] i was on the on a happy side for me
[2:24:31] today and i just appreciated the word
[2:24:33] and what it did inside of me
[2:24:35] and how it's awakening us layer by layer
[2:24:38] word by word it's waking us
[2:24:42] and i was thinking there's so many
[2:24:44] thoughts that i had while i was
[2:24:45] preaching and so many things were tying
[2:24:46] together
[2:24:47] i love it when the preacher he's not
[2:24:49] just filling time so he can close the
[2:24:51] service but he can't find the stopping
[2:24:53] point there's so much
[2:24:54] because everything ties together
[2:24:57] when you see that there is one mystery
[2:24:59] of god all the mysteries are telling the
[2:25:01] one mystery
[2:25:02] and the mystery of god revealed and when
[2:25:04] you see the whole mystery of god
[2:25:05] revealed you see the unveiling of god
[2:25:07] where do you start and where do you stop
[2:25:09] it's all the same story
[2:25:12] he said there's many parts of this it's
[2:25:13] just the same sermon
[2:25:15] you change the title you go to different
[2:25:17] places in the scripture different parts
[2:25:18] of the message but it's all the same
[2:25:20] sermon friends
[2:25:22] it's the it's the hour that we live in
[2:25:25] but he said god's purpose was to have a
[2:25:28] bride of his own choosing
[2:25:30] and that bride he was going to choose
[2:25:31] was going to have his very character
[2:25:33] that's why he placed his life inside of
[2:25:35] her
[2:25:36] and when when god came in the form of
[2:25:38] his son jesus christ he displayed the
[2:25:40] character of the father was displayed in
[2:25:42] the sun
[2:25:44] and the son displayed the character in
[2:25:47] perfect submission
[2:25:48] he only did what the father showed him
[2:25:50] he only operated according to the word
[2:25:54] and so when his bride manifests what
[2:25:56] kind of character will she have
[2:25:58] she will only do what her husband shows
[2:26:00] her and what her husband shows her is
[2:26:02] the revealing of the word so it's just
[2:26:06] the same
[2:26:07] story the same life in another form
[2:26:10] a continuation of the same unfolding of
[2:26:13] the mystery of god
[2:26:15] and he and now he and she
[2:26:20] in this message submission
[2:26:23] when he was talking about submission
[2:26:24] it's amazing it began to strike me in my
[2:26:26] seat
[2:26:28] that that satan had victory we've talked
[2:26:31] about as many times
[2:26:32] but satan came in by deception by
[2:26:34] getting the woman to leave her headship
[2:26:36] he got victory in god's eden so god is
[2:26:39] now going to come and through the woman
[2:26:41] have victory in satan's eden
[2:26:44] and the devil got victory by a woman who
[2:26:48] who failed in submission and took her
[2:26:50] own thinking contrary to the headship of
[2:26:52] the word
[2:26:54] but now he's going to reverse it and
[2:26:55] reverse everything that was done wrong
[2:26:57] there
[2:26:58] by having a woman who would come in
[2:26:59] perfect submission to headship
[2:27:01] and never take her thinking over the
[2:27:03] word it's the same story
[2:27:05] flipped on its head now in satan's eden
[2:27:09] and that's how he's going to have
[2:27:10] victory through the woman
[2:27:12] it's him through her and now she's going
[2:27:14] to display the same character
[2:27:16] and it's going to be perfect submission
[2:27:18] to the full revelation of the full word
[2:27:20] and she will no longer take any man's
[2:27:23] idea
[2:27:23] or her own idea or emotions or thoughts
[2:27:27] or traditions or histories
[2:27:29] or a church or anybody else she's just
[2:27:31] going to take the word and the word only
[2:27:34] and it's going to reverse the whole
[2:27:36] thing that was upset in the beginning
[2:27:37] we're going to come back to a millennium
[2:27:39] come back to an eden
[2:27:42] i thought it's amazing how satan got the
[2:27:45] victory in godzilla and god's going to
[2:27:46] get the victory in satan's eden
[2:27:48] but which age is he's going to do this
[2:27:50] in he's going to do it in the laodicean
[2:27:52] church age
[2:27:53] and the laodicean church ages people's
[2:27:56] rights
[2:27:58] and in the time of people's rights he's
[2:28:01] going to have a people who will give up
[2:28:02] all the rights to the headship of the
[2:28:04] word
[2:28:05] oh god is so perfect he loves the
[2:28:08] contrast
[2:28:10] and he loves to show himself in the
[2:28:11] contrast and under the time of people's
[2:28:14] rights
[2:28:15] it's actually a display also of
[2:28:18] god's choice to put himself in
[2:28:20] partnership with man
[2:28:22] by free moral agency and what is free
[2:28:25] moral agency
[2:28:27] your right to choose is that right
[2:28:31] and god has subjected himself to this
[2:28:34] law of free moral agency
[2:28:38] and so when you begin to look at
[2:28:39] people's rights
[2:28:41] and god giving people a right
[2:28:47] then you realize it's my
[2:28:50] right to surrender my rights to him
[2:28:54] and nobody can take my right away from
[2:28:57] me
[2:28:57] it is my god-given right under free
[2:28:59] moral agency
[2:29:00] it is my right in the face of a
[2:29:02] laodicean church age that says people
[2:29:04] write it is my right my privilege
[2:29:07] my joy my pleasure to give all of my
[2:29:11] headship
[2:29:11] to him
[2:29:14] and nobody can take that right away from
[2:29:17] me
[2:29:19] people have tried to pressure people to
[2:29:21] submission they've tried to force
[2:29:22] submission
[2:29:23] and this is not an issue of for
[2:29:25] submission this is a
[2:29:26] free will offering i want him
[2:29:30] to have me and i want to give all of
[2:29:32] myself
[2:29:33] to him the now in the face of people's
[2:29:37] rights
[2:29:37] it's my right it's my
[2:29:40] choice to exercise my free or moral
[2:29:43] agency that god gave me
[2:29:44] and it's my right to lay down my rights
[2:29:50] and to lay my veil on his shoulders
[2:29:54] and choose him as my head
[2:29:58] and nobody's going to take that from me
[2:30:01] i do it willingly
[2:30:03] i do it with joy i do it with rejoicing
[2:30:08] there was something that brother david
[2:30:10] said that struck me so hard when he's
[2:30:12] saying it
[2:30:13] he said yielding to the outer man
[2:30:17] yielding to the outer man because this
[2:30:19] is the old husband that's supposed to be
[2:30:20] dead
[2:30:22] yielding to the outer man is flirting
[2:30:24] with the devil
[2:30:28] wrecking you there therefore yourselves
[2:30:30] dead
[2:30:34] let the dead stay dead
[2:30:37] that you can have life
[2:30:41] the outer man is everything you see
[2:30:44] taste
[2:30:44] feel smell and hear your memory
[2:30:48] reasoning conscience and affections
[2:30:51] let us all die and let's not
[2:30:55] flirt with that outer man
[2:30:59] but let's stay unified with the headship
[2:31:01] of the word which is
[2:31:02] in the inner man and continually submit
[2:31:07] to him i love the way brother david
[2:31:10] preached he didn't preach a for
[2:31:12] submission he didn't preach submission
[2:31:14] in the way that if you don't submit
[2:31:16] you're going to hell
[2:31:16] if you don't submit you're not bride
[2:31:18] what he preached is why not
[2:31:21] what do you have to lose you have
[2:31:23] everything to gain
[2:31:24] nothing to lose why not submit
[2:31:29] and in the face of the picture that the
[2:31:31] brother painted this morning
[2:31:32] there's nothing in me that's resisting
[2:31:35] there's nothing in me that wants to
[2:31:36] resist
[2:31:37] there's nothing in my soul that wants to
[2:31:39] hold back i want him to have all of me i
[2:31:41] want him to have more of me than he's
[2:31:42] ever had
[2:31:43] i want the outer man deader than it's
[2:31:44] ever been and i want the inside man to
[2:31:46] be united with christ
[2:31:47] more than it's ever been it's our
[2:31:50] heart's desire it's what's already in us
[2:31:52] he already placed inside craving he
[2:31:54] already praised the faith on the inside
[2:31:56] and the word is coming and peeling away
[2:31:58] all the false so that the true can come
[2:32:00] bubbling up and say that's what i've
[2:32:02] always wanted is that kind of
[2:32:05] relationship with him
[2:32:08] oh i appreciate the word how many of you
[2:32:10] will be praying for brother david
[2:32:13] he'll be here i think for another week
[2:32:14] or so and then be traveling home and
[2:32:17] just pray for him i enjoyed
[2:32:20] what the lord laid on his heart let's
[2:32:23] just bow our heads and pray and thank
[2:32:24] the lord
[2:32:26] oh lord jesus i thank you
[2:32:30] i thank you god for the word that you've
[2:32:32] brought in the picture that you've
[2:32:33] painted
[2:32:34] the invitation that you've given to us
[2:32:36] lord
[2:32:38] because you've never wanted force lord
[2:32:40] you've never won in forced relationship
[2:32:43] you're not a barbarian or a beast lord
[2:32:45] that would take a woman and
[2:32:47] just grab her by force and force her
[2:32:49] lord to be a wife
[2:32:51] but you were looking for a wife that
[2:32:53] would reflect your character
[2:32:55] and your character with submission
[2:32:57] yielding to the will of the father
[2:33:00] and you're looking for a bride that will
[2:33:02] have that same character
[2:33:03] where you can just present yourself and
[2:33:06] give her the option
[2:33:07] you're looking for that one that'll say
[2:33:09] i want you
[2:33:11] i want you to have all of me i don't
[2:33:13] want anything else or anything in the
[2:33:15] past or
[2:33:15] anything that i thought i i lay it all
[2:33:18] aside and i just want you
[2:33:21] that's the bride you're looking for that

[2:37:09] you know he said arise come away
[2:37:14] why did he say arise because she was
[2:37:16] sleeping
[2:37:18] and in the laboratory and church ages
[2:37:19] they were all sleeping
[2:37:21] so he had to start with a resurrection
[2:37:24] arise
[2:37:26] and then a coming away and for us
[2:37:29] he had to raise us out of dead
[2:37:31] denominationalism
[2:37:32] and bring us into a rapture and so now
[2:37:35] we've resurrected
[2:37:37] and now we're being raptured as we walk
[2:37:38] with him in the rapture
[2:37:41] arise and come away
