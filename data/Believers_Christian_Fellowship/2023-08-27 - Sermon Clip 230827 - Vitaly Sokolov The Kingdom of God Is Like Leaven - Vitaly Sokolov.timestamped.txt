[0:00] the meal is actually made of grain but
[0:03] the the parable doesn't say she had to
[0:06] mix the leaven with the grain
[0:09] right so the grain the wheat had to
[0:13] undergo a certain process before
[0:16] 11 was actually added
[0:18] right
[0:20] and and the process is not nice
[0:24] because before that you would have
[0:29] different sizes of the grains right oh
[0:33] you have a lot of stuff here to use as
[0:36] as visual aids you know so so so you
[0:39] would have a grain this size
[0:42] and then you would have a grain this
[0:45] size
[0:45] and it would have a grain this size
[0:50] and we have a tall grain like this you
[0:52] know
[0:53] and before
[0:55] before they go into the process of
[0:59] grinding
[1:01] they're all different sizes
[1:04] right sorry this may be for the kids you
[1:08] know you never know so it depends on
[1:10] what the audience is pulling you know so
[1:14] but but I mean just different we we come
[1:18] up you know as as bright material as
[1:21] bright raw material
[1:23] we come in different sizes
[1:26] right we come come in you know and and
[1:29] you know sometimes uh you know these
[1:32] guys are kind of the same but when this
[1:35] guy shows up
[1:36] it's like
[1:39] oh I'm a real grain you know
[1:44] oh
[1:46] so so they're all you know coming into
[1:49] the grinding machine but but they
[1:52] they're talking in between themselves
[1:53] and they're saying you know you know
[1:56] this this guy says you know I'm kind of
[1:58] one of the tallest and biggest and
[1:59] decisions of this one that says and I've
[2:01] always lived a clean life you know you
[2:04] know and this and this and this guy says
[2:06] well I'm kind of the the highest and the
[2:09] tallest here and I'm kind of you know
[2:10] really stylish and nice here but how
[2:13] about this guy
[2:15] and this guy doesn't even open his mouth
[2:17] you know he's like
[2:19] is is looking up to all of them is like
[2:23] am I will I ever make it
[2:28] but this guy here you know he lifts his
[2:30] voice and he says
[2:31] you all guys
[2:33] you don't know what you're talking about
[2:35] you know
[2:36] because you know I'm so big and tall
[2:40] nobody can beat me
[2:42] well nobody except the grinding machine
[2:50] oh my goodness so then then the Lord
[2:54] takes all of them Embraces because he
[2:56] actually loves all of them
[2:58] so he loves all of them and he's like oh
[3:02] you you look nice now but after you come
[3:05] out from there you look even nicer
[3:09] so so he opens up you know the the
[3:12] machine oh you got the machine here
[3:13] right yeah so he opens you know the the
[3:17] uh the the grinding machine and he
[3:19] throws all of this into here
[3:23] and there's
[3:25] a lot of work
[3:28] there's a lot of Trials you know brother
[3:30] Brown says but today I know it was all
[3:33] working for my good I know the life had
[3:35] to be ground
[3:36] Twisted squeezed and to get what it was
[3:41] out
[3:42] there was too much Brenham in there had
[3:44] to be squeezed out before God could take
[3:46] himself known so that means before you
[3:50] receive a revelation before crisis is
[3:52] ready to to be added as leaven you
[3:55] should be meal by then
[3:57] you should be grounded by then
[4:00] oh
[4:01] because without humility you you're not
[4:03] receiving revelation
[4:06] Hallelujah
[4:08] so all of these guys go into the
[4:10] grinding machine and when they get out
[4:14] there's no big ones
[4:16] there's no tall ones there's no
[4:17] transparent ones there's no small ones
[4:20] they are all the same size
[4:25] and by then they are already mixed
[4:27] together
[4:31] laughs
[4:33] so when there's all the same size
[4:36] and it's almost like you know
[4:38] did you did you also have to go through
[4:41] that oh yeah
[4:43] did your kids do that oh yeah
[4:47] did you pray for so many nights and days
[4:50] oh yeah
[4:52] do they have a problem with your job oh
[4:53] yeah
[4:55] do they have a health issue oh yeah all
[4:58] of these
[5:00] we all have to go through that
