========================================
in the morning when i rise in the morning when i rise in the morning when i rise oh give me jesus give me jesus oh [Music] is give me if jesus when [Music] i want to die to this world don't you give me jesus give me jesus oh yes give me jesus give me between the i'll meet you there between the wings of the chairs between [Music] praise the lord certainly good to be with you this evening amen while we're standing let's take our bibles and turn into the book of psalms amen we're gonna continue on with the seventh seal family and uh this may be the last part for now we'll see we'll see how it goes we're making no promises that's my disclaimer no promises let's let the lord lead as the lord does so often always leads in our lives but i feel like this could be the last one i want to take a look at teens and young adults today as we're progressing through but i'll start to start with reading out of the book of psalm chapter 127 psalms 127. and we'll pick that up at verse 1. we've been reading from verse 3 but tonight i'd like to pick it up from verse 1. psalms 127 and verse 1. except the lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the lord keep the city the watchman waketh in vain this is going to be important as we talk about raising teens and young adults this is the reason why we're going to read this scripture first let's read it again except the lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the lord keep the city the watchman wakeeth but in vain it is vain for you to rise up early to sit up late to eat the bread of sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep lo children are in heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward as arrows are in the hand of the mighty man soar the children of the youth happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gates and let's ask the lord his blessing over the word dear lord jesus we thank you god that we can be here tonight lord it's a privilege lord just to be able to gather together to sing your praises to worship your name to hear your word preached lord we just pray you would take preeminence now that you would speak through these lips of clay that you would hear lord through our ears and that you would let this word drop into our heart and manifest into a life lord let it translate lord from the preaching to the living lord and let it be done in us we ask for these things in jesus christ's name amen you're going to be seated you can have your seats and bring up the powerpoint i want to before i launch into everything i want to go through teens and adults i want to wrap up something from last wednesday we were talking about young children raising children and some things that i didn't get to and i just want to drop some points in there because there's questions that i get from time to time and so i'd like to answer that really quickly before we move too far to read this quote again that we've been focusing on any man in his family a correct good noble obedient family is one with another any family and if there's something in the family that moves them apart then it's not right boy i tell you this is this is this isn't rocket science but this is profound you know it's simple but it's powerful and we should be sometimes watching for that thing that's driving us apart you know every once in a while tension hits a family brother venom says any family i i can't remember the message he says in a couple different messages but i was just listening to a tape the other day and brother ben was saying any family they'll just go along and every once in a while they just kind of hit a spot where several things go wrong he said you're entering into a night cycle and he says that happens to all of us that happens to everyone and everything begins cruising right along and everything's going smooth and you hit a spot where there's tension over for whatever reason maybe multiple things come together at the same time there's tension in a family but what brother bam says is if there's something in the family that moves them apart then it's not right the family is broken somewhere and so this is a key for us to start to have spiritual discernment when we see something hitting and something trying to break the family that's the time to stop quit moving forward stop for a minute say god show me what is causing this tension what's behind this what's the enemy trying to do where is it coming from is it because we're too busy is it because dad's working too many hours and away from home is it because we've got too much on our plate we've taken on too many activities what's going on why is there something coming and creating this tension and driving us apart amen because if there's something that moves them apart then it's not right even if the activity itself is not wicked or evil but the fact that it's driving the family apart makes it not right because it's it's always easy to get busier has anybody noticed that oh it's easy to get busy getting busy is not hard getting busy is easy especially if you have a family it seems like it's non-stop you can get busy and if you want to be busier you can get busier but but sometimes that's detrimental to the health of the family because everybody's going in opposite directions and we don't have that time that we need so if anything moves them apart then it's not right the family's broken somewhere so we have to be diligent and watchful especially as fathers and as mothers we need to work together and be watchful and be prayerful when we see something begin to move in and move the family apart we need to that's the time to go to prayer and say go on i need an answer i need you to show me what it is and you got to be careful when you can't pray that kind of prayer because when you pray that kind of prayer and all you see is your faith looking back then you know where the problem is i've prayed prayers like that and i've seen myself but if we're going to pray that prayer honestly then we've got to be honest all the way through with whatever god shows us we got to deal with it sometimes it's us sometimes it's something we allow sometimes to somebody else sometimes there's other extended family putting pressure on the family it could be any myriad of reasons but we've got to be watchful we've got to be discerning because our family life matters i say it matters you know brother brenham told us the order of things god first family second others third and ourselves last so family life matters it goes on to say they should all be one father with mother mother with father children with parent parent with children all in agreement and when you see that you'll see one lovely picture praise god because that's the masterpiece picture and this applies to teenagers brother branham wasn't excluding them when he made this statement all one mother with father father mother parent with child child with parent all the way through this it's a false notion it's a layout to see an idea that you have to accept teenage rebellion amen that that is not in the scriptures it's a layer to see an idea to think it's inevitable that they're just going to rebel at some point and you have to deal with it yeah they're going to go through things every child is going to go through things and different phases of life will bring different things but we don't have to just roll over and accept the fact that yeah it's going to be horrible when they get to be teenagers you know it's you know they told us it was going to be horrible when they turned two they turned two and it wasn't horrible then if it didn't happen at two it'll happen at three they turned three and it wasn't terrible then this and this and this and you know you're always told well wait till they're teenagers because you know nobody likes it when things work out for somebody else it's amazing you know they see the family together and they see your children in order and they see the family happy and order and obedient and then the very next thing they'll say to you they'll say oh your family's so nice but you just wait till they're teenagers it's like why'd you have to say that why couldn't you stop with everything so nice why did you have to add that in amen and and so we can get that mindset and we can accept that as a truth and if we accept that of the truth we may very well get the very thing we believe will have but we have to determine that i'm not accepting this as an inevitable outcome not every teenager is going to rebel and it's not going to be terrible in their teenage years don't accept that as the truth that's not a bible truth amen things may be difficult they may not be difficult just wait and see what happens don't expect the worst so we want the family to be one now when i go back to young children and child training up through the toddlers up into the young children age we talked about that a lot how we establish it on uh the foundation of love and build from there and and then we we ended with talking about chastisement spanking and all kinds of punishment uh talked about the the method that god uses through seals trumpets vials we see it in the scriptures how god always deals with his children he always sends a prophet to break to them a seal he opens up what he wants them to know and then when they violate that he sounds a trump and he gives them a warning and when they don't hear the warning then the vial is poured out and the vial is poured out and the plague falls so we we talked about that but the the main thing and i just wanted to hit this for a minute before we moved on that we need to teach these these little toddlers as they move through is we need to teach them respect respect and there's a lot of things that they need to learn to respect but number one they need to respect mom and dad because that'll pay huge dividends down the road and they need to respect your word all right if they need to learn to respect your word let your yay be yay in your neighbor all right so they need to learn to respect the parents and this happens when they're we little because we go through the right process because we've got a vision of what we want and and we work according to the vision like i said last time when that little tiny todd baby is handed to you we need to have a vision for its life we need to have a desire for this life a plan that god has laid out and the desire we have as parents we're not just going to keep walking and hoping things work out when we get there but we've got a desire we've got a goal we've got a picture that we want in our mind we want a family in harmony we want our children to feel loved and content and feel safe and we want we want to be connected to them and we want to enjoy our children we want to enjoy our home we want other people to enjoy our children we want them to grow up to be respectable we want them to grow up to have respect and so we start off with a plan so when they have respect for their parents they should have respect for the parents verbal command because if you can teach them to respect your word you're setting them up to respect the word when your word doesn't mean anything you're setting them up for failure as parents we've got to teach them that our word to teach them verbal commands and not verbal commands spoken in anger this is where we get in trouble all the time this is where i failed many times but not they they learn to finally listen when our voice hits that certain tone we've told them multiple times in fact i've made this statement before i've heard my dad make the statement i repeated the same statement and i realized as i make this statement i'm speaking of failure in the statement and i've said i've told you multiple times that was one of my dad's favorites and when i repeated it i just announced my failure because i shouldn't have ever got to the place where i had to tell you multiple times that means i didn't go through the process right the first time that means i did not make my word important to you and i didn't stand by my word and i didn't go through the process and that's better when they're this big because it gets harder when they're this big the lessons are easier when they're tiny amen they're easier to reinforce you have control you run their whole life it's much easier when they're little so they learn to respond to your verbal command spoken in a normal tone of voice this is a challenge this is where we all fail i raised my hands first i failed i failed many times but i don't want to fail but i know that that's that's right we want them to respect other adults not just us in our home but respect all adults because what are we teaching them we're teaching them to respect authority anybody that's over them is worthy of respect because that's going to pay pay big dividends down the road because the real problem is rebellion and we're fighting against rebellion and when you teach the proper respect when they're young you're already inoculating them against rebellion but when you allow them to rebel to grandma we allow them to rebel to so-and-so and uncle this and and older siblings you're allowing them to get in an atmosphere of rebellion where a rebellion under certain circumstances is okay and like i said it's easier when they're this big to take care of this now need to teach them respect for church officers like the deacons aren't the enemies of little kids all right the teach teach them respect for the ministry for the church officers for their sunday school teachers for for everyone they need to learn respect for that they need to learn respect for the sanctuary because we've set the sanctuary apart and they need to realize this sanctuary is a place that we as a people have dedicated to the worship of the lord this isn't a playground i i remember when when our kids were younger i i expected i expected my children to sit in church and pay attention and and they could play they could play at the house they could play all over but they weren't coming to church to play because i wanted my children to realize that there is something that mom and dad dem way more important than your entertainment and that's worshiping god it's it's good for kids to realize i mean you're talking about just a short period of time coming into the sanctuary how many times how much time do you spend in the sanctuary throughout the week it's good for those children to get the idea that this is way more important than me this is mom and dad deemed this more important than me and i wanted my kids to know there is something way more important than you because that's a problem with our society kids growing up thinking there's nothing more important than them and that and that lesson is being reinforced over and over and over again but they need to get the message real clear early on there are things in this world that is more important than you and worshiping god is one of them and keeping the sanctity of the sanctuary is one of those things so so i've had questions people ask me what do you do and what age and all of this training your children to sit in church and all i want to say to you is god made you the parents the holy ghost will anoint you with the right leadership for your children but i also say it this way have a vision of what you want you bring them to church have an idea of what you want what are you looking for what is your expectation at certain ages in certain stages what do you expect i mean do you expect do you expect to come in and out 20 times well when you've got a 12 month old to an 18 month old that might not be an unrealistic expectation until they get trained but it shouldn't be that way with a five-year-old we have to understand one of that's my goal i want my children to learn and sit to sit and listen to the word will they catch everything no no but they need to learn the respect they need to learn the reverence they need to learn that this is what we do as a family and i'm coming here as a dad i'm coming here as mom to hear the word preach to worship my god and you're not going to distract me from worshiping god because this is more important that's not a bad lesson that's a good thing friends you taught your children a good thing so when we were when we were raising our children we we tried all kinds of different tactics we tried all kinds of different things but we begin to realize that toys don't work we thought you know bring them a little toy and they keep themselves a little entertained the problem is they're learning to be entertained in church and when they get tired of that one toy what do they look for they're bored of that they want another toy so you bring another toy and then what happens is mom brings in a bag full of toys to try to get through the service but it doesn't work it's in because because what we're doing is we're feeding into the lust of a little child the lust to be entertained and when one toy doesn't work they get another tour and get another toy and then you've got the toys all over the seat in the floor then you got kids laying in the floor smashing cars together and then you got the parents with their kids sitting next to your kids watching them smash cars on the floor and they're not allowed to move and now we're creating all kinds of trouble see what i mean we've got to have a vision what do i want i'm not here to entertain them i'm not here to make this fun amen now this is about listening to the word of god this is about worshiping god as a family this isn't about how much fun you can have because i promise you it won't work everything you do is temporary so then mom and dad will start hiding toys because 30 minutes into this earth they get dirty this toy so i got a new we're always working a gimmick we're always working a plan we're always hiding something back or we only have these toys at church you see what i'm saying that child's learning to be entertained at church and what will happen is if we keep feeding that keep feeding that keep feeding that you're going to have a pre-teen who cannot sit and listen to preaching he's bored out of his mind because he's been entertained all through his toddler years amen so what we did is we just decided that we'd let our children write or draw or even color because what am i training them to i'm training them to take notes in church i'm training them to this is my goal this is my vision amen i'll let them write amen they could start off with colored pencils or whatever doing a little bit of this and then that went away then they had just a paper and just a pencil and then they start following along in their bible and then they start and now all of them take notes all of them have their own notebook their own bible and they sit they write down the preacher they write down the day they write down what he's preaching and they write down every scripture amen i don't think that's an unrealistic expectation and you could say will that save them brother chad no that won't save them but it'll get them a lot further down the road to hearing their word than sitting on their knees turning their seats smashing cars together do we understand it's about the vision it's about the goal you're not going to save your children just because they sit nice in church that doesn't mean they're saved amen but sitting and listening in church is a whole lot better way to hear the word of god for salvation than playing and sleeping and and going in and out and running around out in the foyer or playing in the nursery you see what i'm saying there now you can't expect you know a two-year-old to take notes you have to be led of the spirit of god but you've got to have a vision what's my vision what's my goal what am i trying to accomplish and god what do we do now to meet that because if you don't have a vision if you don't have a goal then you just pack a bunch of toys because you're just trying to get through the service but if we do the hard work amen of having difficult services when your kid or little then once you get that child trained sitting next to you in the service doing something that's non-distracting and guess what you get to enjoy the service it pays big dividends back amen and if you train your oldest children that sets an example for the next one coming back and if you keep the standard right the next ones just fall right in line so the first one is the best one to work with because it makes it a lot easier all the way down because what's our goal our goal is to teach these children respect i can't i can't give them the holy ghost because they sit and look respectfully at the preacher and listen but if i can teach them to respect the word of god respect the house of god respect the ministry respect that then they're in position that they can receive and i want my children to receive the word as early as they're able to i don't want to delay it because of my training i want to do everything i can to set them up amen so that means you know i'm just sharing some of my our experiences my wife and i experiences because not it's not not any two are the same you don't have to do it this is not cookie cutter we're not making any requirements i'm just sharing your testimony just give you some inspiration but you need to be inspired by the lord on how to take this child god gave me and train it the way god wants it trained so don't copy everybody else you can learn good things you can try them but this is we're not in the business of copying anymore so i'm sharing some experiences not for you to copy them just to share them for inspiration it might inspire you in something but but i started myself as dad training my children when they were about 18 months old to sit in church before that you know they have needs that only mom can meet the needs and for us by the time 18 months was along we either had another baby or one coming really soon expecting one so it was kind of needful i got this one taken care of before the next infant comes along so hey that was necessity but around 18 months give or take on the on the child a few months i start training them and what i do is when they needed to go out i took them out right because they were already used to going out with mom and when mom would take him out it was time to eat to get a drink to get a change to do something amen and now that dad took him out it's different we have a transition i started taking them out and when dad took them out it was absolutely no fun whatsoever because we would sit on the bench out there and watch the monitor and they weren't allowed to move from my side sit on my lap or i would stand and hold them and watch the monitor because we're still about worship it's always about worship amen and when we're out there there's no pencil there's no pen there's no colored pencil there's no there's no bible book bible picture book there's nothing to look at nothing to do out there's boring but at least in my seat next to that i can flip through my bible storybook i can flip through my story bible i can write something down on a piece of paper at least there's some privilege here but there's no privilege out there see it's not rocket science it's simple and and it didn't take very long now i'd have to work with them and some got it like that and some took longer and we're not naming any names but they're not all the same you just have to deal with them according to understanding you know the way god anoints you but the fact is every one of them learned to sit in church every one of them learned to listen to the preacher every one of them learned to take notes everyone learned learned respect for the house of god respect for the ministry respect for the word so it can be done so when i take them out their feet never hit the floor because if they're if they're if they're rowdy rambunctious noisy in here and we take them out of church and we set them down and let them go running around here and playing in the flower pots and run from here and run from there and then they're rewarded for being noisy there's a reward so if if i'm loud in church i get to go out and play in the foyer or i get to go in the library and roll around with friends and eat snacks and play and have a big time where do you think they're going to want to go it's about child training this is about training what do i want i want to sit in church and hear the preaching of the word and i want my child to sit there quietly with me that's what i want if that's what we want then you have to work towards that it's not something magically that just happens one day you wake up and poof there it is i mean it might happen at 14 or 15 but i want it earlier so you have to have a vision we have to have a desire what is it we want to do and what are we looking for the nursery is a great place when you have a little toddler and sometimes they're just fried they just can't take no more i mean when they're wee little sometimes they're just fried you know they're fried hey you're fried too sometimes that happens but you also realize that sometimes you can go to the nursery and i don't know how it is now i just i'll just speak years back from experience with my wife in there the nursery can end up being a social gathering for moms and play time for the tots that is not what the church nursery's for it's not and it's hard because you know two moms sit there and their kids start touching each other and playing the moms start talking you gotta guard against that it's a natural progress of events that takes place it's not anybody being evil not anybody doing wrong but it can easily go that way to where you're sitting next to each other and it's hard for two sisters to sit next to each other and just look out the glass and just pay attention to free it's not in their nature most of the time especially when they have something in common like they're raising children they have a family and all of a sudden they feel that pool coming from the chair next to them so it's not an evil thing but it's something to be careful of because what are the children learning the children are learning the nurseries not church i don't have to pay attention there it's fun in there it's not fun in here so got to be careful there's times you need the nursery you need to use them their seasons of life you need them but be careful that the nursery is an extension of the sanctuary not a playroom and not mom's social hour is that clear i don't say that to be mean but i say that that's the truth we need to be aware of that because all of us slip a little bit we slip amen and bad habits come in we got to shake ourselves back up and guess what will happen we might get it right here and i might have to say something again in several years because this is human nature we have to be aware of things and come back in line because what's my goal is i want to train my child to respect the house of god and respect the word of god something else that we don't want is food and drinks in the sanctuary because that's not what this is for we've got nurseries if your child needs something you can go to a nursery but the the sanctuary is not for food and drinks even for toddlers so we want to be careful of that as well this is where we come to worship god he gets preeminence above everything else he gets preeminence we have nurseries when we have to take care of stuff but nursery is an extension of the sanctuary if you're training your children train your children think everything i'm doing is training if if they scream and yell and get to go look at a book and play in the foyer we just train them to be loud to get to go play it doesn't work that way we've got to think what we're doing and it matters so everything we do matters and this this this age when they're little they're absorbing things so fast they're changing so quickly you think i'm never going to get through this phase but i'll tell you we've been through it five times you get through it faster than you ever imagined and what you do every day that consistency pays off in the long run and you may be thinking oh the child's three it's they're never going to sit in church they're never going to get it i promise you they will they will they'll get it just stick with it some will get it fast some it will take a lot longer amen some will make you look like a hero some will make you look like a zero but it's not about impressing the other parents it's about this child learning respect for the sanctuary so that we as a family can worship god together it's not about impressing anybody else it's not about taking somebody else's tactic we've got to have the right vision and the right motive in doing what we're doing so we're not all copying we're not all trying to be the same but we all have the same vision that we want our children to learn respect we want our children to learn to sit and hear the word of god and you're the parent you're the one who determines at what age and what station that's why god gave those children to you not to me and not to the person sitting next to you and not even the grandma god gave him to you you're the one god's going to anoint to lead that child you know their temperament you know the maturity level you know what they can handle amen just let the lord lead you but don't make excuses when it's time to move to another stage you got to be led of the lord to move so don't fear anybody else don't worry about what anybody else is doing focus on the charge that god gave you and focus on the goal that you have for this child what do i want i want to worship together as a family i want my children to sit on my lap or sit next to me hear the word of god they can look at a little book that's no problem they can draw on a piece of paper that's no problem as long as they learn to sit respectfully and quiet and listen you'll watch you'll be able to eventually take the little book away they won't want it no more they'll quit drawing pictures and they'll start writing scriptures right it starts to get fun you start to help them look up bible verses when they bring their own bible guess what they want to do with their own bible they want to read what everybody else is reading what do you do you're training them in the service how to receive the word they want to look in their little bible amen and they have their own little bible and i remember if you remember my testimony it was out of breanna's precious moments bible that god spoke to me and called me into the ministry out of her precious moments bible man that says a lot doesn't it maybe that's the way i am maybe that's the way god has to speak to me but what i was doing she was sitting on my lap and she couldn't even read but i had taught her we'd turn the description her bible because she liked her bible and i would take her little finger and i would follow along as the minister read the scripture and she loved that and every time there would be a new scripture read and she saw people turning their bible she'd hold out her little finger what was i doing i was training her in a way that she was enjoying it doesn't have to be torture we can make it enjoyable so that the children enjoy sitting with you sitting on your lap you're holding them tight you're going through the bible with them you're letting sit next to you they're leaning on you it's they're close to you the kids love to lean on mom just don't let them do it when they're 12. that's odd for the people sitting behind you but but make it enjoyable but trained we got to train our children and we've got to all do this together amen so that i wanted to wrap up that's something that i wanted to get to last time and i didn't have a chance to now i want to move forward as we talk about going to the next stage as we we go through infants to toddlers to young children now we're moving up into the teenage years and this is in no way have we exhausted everything that we could teach or talk about on these subjects but it's just we go as the lord leads and we hit some things that the lord wants to highlight at this time we can always circle back around and do more on these things later but as we move into the teenage years this is like i said certainly not going to be exhaustive in any way but just the direction i feel to go in on this subject now i've been talking pretty much just to parents but tonight's going to be different because i'm going to talk to the teenagers and the young adults too because now you've been trained to sit in church and listen aren't you happy now you can listen to what i have to tell you so i'm going to talk to you and i'm going to talk to the parents because this once we get into this stage of life this is more of a team effort between the children and the parents we're going to do this stage together and so brother branham says the scripture says in ephesians 6 children obey your parents in the lord for this is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth this is a commandment apostle paul is picking up one of the commandments that moses had received from the lord one of the ten commandments to honor thy father and thy mother and he reinforces it here in the new testament this is not a scripture to the parents this is a scripture to you right your parents already know it and then they already had their opportunity either to succeed or fail in fulfilling this word but this is the part of the word that's instructed to you for you to fulfill to obey your parents in the lord this is right and honor thy father and thy mother the apostle paul also says in colossians 3 20 children obey your parents in all things that's my favorite part of the scripture as a parent in all things not the things that you think i'm right about in all things trying to be your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto your parents that's not the motivation for doing it amen children obey your parents and all things for this is well pleasing unto the lord my question to you young folks out here you teenagers is do you want to be well pleasing to the lord and i'm going to answer for you yes i know you do but this is how you can be well pleasing to the lord by honoring mother and father by obeying your parents in all things and i want to look at some of the negative side of that in in first samuel 15 23 it says for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry so this is the way god views rebellion and this is the way god views stubbornness so now you guys have come to the age of accountability you're beyond you know mom and dad controlling your every move you're getting into a situation where mom and dad physically can't control everything you do amen because you're you're you you have a mind you have a body uh that you can you can you have control over you can go places and do things someone some of you have driver's license you can drive places you can go to friends house every move you make cannot be physically controlled by mom and dad now you're moving to an age of accountability now it's about more than just mom and dad now it's about me being right with the lord now it's about me and god and to keep me and god right and me and god in harmony i have to honor my father and my mother and i have to obey my mom and dad because this is well pleasing to the lord this is what god wanted because if i show rebellion to mom and dad god views my rebellion as witchcraft it's evil and it's wicked so rebellion is the son of witchcraft and stubbornness is iniquity in idolatry so this is no longer about mom and dad this is about you beyond the age of accountability having to give an answer for your contact conduct to god so now it gets a little bit more serious now it's not the parents who are squirming in their seats only we're all in this together because you're beyond the age of accountability you'll be accountable to god i read this out of deuteronomy i don't read this to scare you because we're not applying this part of the law anymore but just to show you if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son which will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and that when they have chastened him will not hearken unto them then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him and bring him out into the elders of his city and unto the gate of his place and they shall say unto the elders of the city this our son is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey a voice he is a glutton and a drunkard and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones that he die so shalt thou put evil away from among you and all israel shall hear and fear so this is part of the law this is a commandment that came from god through moses and he's telling them that if there is one that is stubborn and rebellious and when you chasten them and they will not listen amen that you take them before the elders and they stone them to death to put evil away from you because god views this as evil so rebellion and stubbornness is not a phase is that clear it's not a phase it's not normal i mean some of you a lot of you have been sheltered from the world some of you have gone to public schools some of you have had cousins that are unbelievers and and friends maybe and you've seen this rebellious attitude towards parents you may have witnessed it you may have heard the attitudes you may have heard the conversations but you have to understand how god views that laodicean may view it as normal laodicea may view it as a phase or a stage in growth but that's not how god sees it he doesn't see it as a phase he doesn't see it as a normal part of growing up he sees it as stubbornness rebellion as witchcraft and iniquity and evil that he wanted put away from the camp so there's two responsibilities here as we move into our teenage years a responsibility for the child and responsibility for the parent luke chapter 2 verse 48 we're going to follow jesus's life it's when jesus was left behind at one of the feasts and he was astonishing the scholars in the temple and verse 48 says and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing and he said unto them how is it that you sought me wished you not that i must be about my father's business and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them and he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and favor with god and man i find this fascinating because jesus at 12 years old in the temple already knew who he was and he already knew what his purpose was and he knew what his father's business was and he knew the word in a way that was going to astonish the scribes and the pharisees he knew more than mary and joseph he had a better understanding than mary and joseph amen he was perfect he was sinless he was without flaw they were full of flaws his understanding was more mature than their understanding his vision was clearer than their vision do you get my point so but even in all of that jesus knew the position his father put him in and his father put him in this position under the care of mary and joseph and jesus subjected himself this is a willful act he wasn't beat he wasn't chained he subjected himself unto them why because he had an understanding of his positional placing from his father [Music] if that's where his father put him that's where he was going to stay and if these were the earthly parents that were given to watch over him until he come to a certain age and he would move out into his ministry until that time he would subject himself to them not because they were smarter not because they had greater revelation not because they knew the word better not because they were more righteous you get the point it had nothing to do with their merit it had nothing to do with their abilities it had nothing to do with their wisdom it had everything to do with his positional placing god put him here he was going to subject himself to them he was wiser he was more righteous he was more pure he had better revelation he had clearer vision so it's easy to get the understanding as a teenager even as a young adult still live in your parents house that you know better than them and they're wrong hey guess what you might i realize day by day my children are getting smarter than me you know we we were playing a game the other day i can't remember so are you smarter than a fifth grader i found out real quick my kids are smarter than me and my wife's smarter than me too and i won't tell you where i ranked but it wasn't highest it's probably somewhere in the middle of the pack but that has nothing to do with the position god's placed me in and the position god's placed in they're getting wiser they're getting i should say more knowledge they're they're growing up they're understanding things better sometimes we get into a discussion and i'll make notes this way i know it's that way and later i find out they were right i was wrong and that happens kind of often and they remembered i forgot they can do math faster than i can do math i mean you see all the way around it's getting bad for me except for the fact that god still positionally placed me as father them as child that hasn't changed that can't change that won't change at some point amen one by one they'll find a place under different headship amen but i i will always be there and i will always be dad but while they're in my home and while they're under my care there's a certain positional placing that god had ordained and we have to show respect unto god's placing and if god puts you under a father it doesn't matter if you know more than him if you're more righteous than him if you have a greater revelation than him are we getting the point it's positional placing it's showing respect to god and i respect god even if i'm having a hard time respecting this man or this woman i respect god amen when mary came to jesus mary denied the virgin birth right in the face of all of those religious leaders amen and she had to be rebuked by jesus mary was in error mary was wrong mary was denying what gabriel had told her you think jesus would have to listen to her then yes he subjected himself to her why because that's where the father wanted him to be and that's how he obeyed the father and showed honor to his father is by subjecting himself to the earthly parents he was placed under see brother madam says in a super sign but it's the father was in him the emmanuel the god the baby god jehovah god that little baby cried that was jehovah can you see it god living in a baby god living in a teenage what type of a teenager was he he set the example oh we just got it he set the example when he was lost by his father and his mother they looked about to find him and they found him in the temple what did he say as a teenager no you not wish thou not that i must be about my father's business example for the teenagers see brother i'm showing he was already had a revelation of who he was spiritually he was an example to the teenagers he already had his own revelation he already knew he must be about his father's business he wasn't waiting till later to get a revelation he had a revelation he understood who he was he knew where he was on earth he knew where he came from he knew what his father's business was and you can know it too as a teenager you don't have to wait till you're married and have children you can right now catch the revelation of what your father's business is for you and why you're here and who you are spiritually and that positioning will never put you out of your natural position under your natural parents because as soon he knew all of that he understood it but he still subjected himself to his mother and joseph followed them back brother branham said worked in a carpentry shop with joseph totally subjected himself knowing what he was called for subjected himself that's god's way that's the way we should do that see god chose saul to be king and saul rebelled against the word of god is that right we read that scripture where rebellion is the sin of witchcraft that's samuel speaking that to saul after saul rejected the word of god so saul rebelled against the word of god he was in rebellion he was rejected from being king and god chose david to be king but until god put david in its king david would not rebel against saul because saul was the lord's anointed so david was called out by a prophet had the anointing poured over him as a type of the baptism of holy ghost he knew what he was predestined for he knew what he was called for he knew what he was born for but yet god had placed this king saul and this king was in rebellion but even though this king was in rebellion this future king wouldn't be in rebellion just because this king's in rebellion see it's about more than the merit of the leadership it's about the expectation of god it's about the design and the placing of god god had put saul here and he had called david to replace all but until god moved saul and moved david up david was under saul because saul was king of israel and david would not touch the lord's anointing why because that's the way god set it up it didn't matter how unrighteous saul was acting he wouldn't go against what god set up and sometimes parents make mistakes they can act in ways that are unrighteous they can make decisions that aren't the most spiritual decisions and sometimes the teenagers or the young adults know it they know that's not a good decision they know you just compromise they know that what you just said wasn't said in righteousness they know that temper wasn't godly they know it they can see it they know it but even if mom and dad get them in a position where they rebel against the word of god by making a mistake or saying something wrong that never could get david to rebel against saul just because saul rebelled against god so just because mom and dad rebel against god does not give the child the right to rebel against mom and dad that makes sense so we've got to do it god's way we've got to stay in harmony with god and and and you have to make we have to make sure when you come to that age of accountability i'm going to do only that which pleases my father not my earthly father but my heavenly father and if this is the position god put me in amen i'll subject myself unto this because god put me here and his word tells me here and i'm now fleshing out the word of god so we always want to live the word when it's super duper stuff i want to manifest the word i'm going to speak something into existence but what about manifesting the word children obey your parents in all things guess what that is a manifestation of the word so we think about the word on display or the word being made manifest as these super things amen if you don't get the abcs right how are you going to do the algebra so it's the little foxes that spoil the vine take us out of the blessings of god because we don't get the little things right we don't obey in the least how will he give us much if we don't obey in the least so now if you're if you're seeking leadership as a teenager from the lord and you want to know your purpose in life and where god wants you to go and and you want these spiritual experiences with god don't forsake the little things don't forsake doing the things you know you ought to do and because you can't forsake this and pray for super duper things we've got to come back to the simple everyday living and obedience to our father and if we walk in obedience god will do the super-duper things praise be to god so we have to walk according to god's word and according to positional placing romans 1 28 and guess what guys i'm talking to you teenagers and i'm really putting the heat on but don't worry we're going to switch gears and hit mom and dad here soon so just hang with me can you say amen see i'm now i'm preaching like an evangelist because an evangelist likes to hear amen can you say amen amen romans 1 28 and even as they did not like to retain god and their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness this is bad stuff fornication is bad wickedness is bad unrighteous is bad covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder is that bad debate deceit malignity whispers backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents guess what disobedient to parents made the hit list of the worst it's not a small thing this isn't a trivial matter this isn't a light thing we should not listen to laodicea we need to shut off the culture we need to move away from what the culture is telling us and come back to the word of god disobedience to parents is not a light matter it's not a trivial thing it's not just you know brother bannon made the statement he said old man old woman he said you should never say something like that because that was a common terminology in that day oh man and that was doing that was just blowing off mom and dad just writing them off they don't know what they're talking about they're old they're already washed up they don't know remember they should never do that that made the list with murderers inventors of evil things wickedness i mean this is not a good list and you say i've never murdered i never invented evil things but you know i mean who can be obedient to their parents somehow in our mind we trivialize certain things and make some worse than others yes sir inventors of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding covenant breakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful i don't want to be on this list placable unmerciful who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death did you remember the law of moses disobedience to parents and the law of moses was that worthy of death according to deuteronomy it was and here paul reinforces it worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them not only do the same but have pleasure and them to do them because it's a big joke when somebody smarts off to their mom and dad it's funny we don't take pleasure in those that do these things it's evil this is a condition of the end time and we live in the end time and this condition is prevalent in the end time brother brandon said in questions and answers from 64. why here in london england just recently they had a rock and roll team to impersonate christ and judas and all that and they called christ daddio and talked to all those words them crazy kids talk see the teenage kids took over the world now you know that the bible predicts that this scripture that we just read in romans is a prediction of the end time disobedience to parents and teenagers start running the show now you know that the bible predicts that unthankful unholy without natural affections truce breakers false accusers disobedient to parents teenage taking over the world and it's done it i say this is a condition in our culture all around this is a condition of the end time this is a condition of laodicea all around us it is this is the world has been given over to the teenagers the parents now are just here to supply all the wants of the youth to fulfill all the youthful lust and that's the that's the role that the parents serve amen and if the parents ever try to take leadership over their child or try to rebuke them or chastise them or refuse all of a sudden they're they're evil in some way the world went completely backwards and upside down so we realize that rebellion is wicked disobedience to parents and teenagers disobeying parents is wicked in evil god hates it let's just let's just line that out right now god hates it but i want to go you guys are off the hook now praise the lord i hope you've all thoroughly repented and now it's time for the rest of us to see what else brother branham has to say let's go back to ephesians 6 1-3 we read this scripture children obey your parents in the lord for this is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment's promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth next scripture and you fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord there's a commandment for the children but there's a commandment for the fathers and they go hand in hand like i said when we get to this stage in life we're working in a partnership because you can't control everything anymore and that's the way it should be because what was the goal from the beginning when god handed you this child that if time would permit the goal is to raise this child to be independent of you to serve god on its own to raise its own family to be part of the church to find its position in the body of believers to work independent of you that was your goal from the beginning so as you go through there should be more independence all the time you should be losing control all the time but if you've if you made the right lessons at the right stages losing control is not a problem because the child now has self-control because you taught that and trained that into them when they were tiny and so now you begin to lose control as the children get older especially as they move into young adults you can't control their every move you can't lock them in the room and only let them out to eat and do school work it doesn't work that way and so you got to be able to lose a little bit of control and you can't have control over everything but that's why you started with respect with respect because they learn to respect and although that child may get bigger than you in physical size and physically you can't do anything physically to control their behavior if we got respect right at three and four years old and we kept it all the way through it's not your physical force that holds them in the line it's the respect that they have for you that holds them in line that's why we have to work from the time they're taught all the way through so that we don't lose or miss our opportunity and your father's provoking all your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurturing admonition of the lord let's go back to colossians 3 we read this too children obey your parents in all things my favorite part right for this is well pleasing unto the lord next part fathers provoke your children provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged this is interesting there's a commandment for the children and a commandment for the fathers this means that as your children get older you can provoke them to anger father's provoking all your children to anger lest they be discouraged i want to look at this scripture again and i want to look at the word discouraged that word discouraged means to be disheartened dispirited or broken in spirit as the children get older we can we can provoke them to anger and they can be discouraged why because if we don't catch the transitions right and you treat a 16 year old like a 10 year old it's not going to work you got to catch the transitions right to where you can nurture and train that child because every year that child should be more independent of you and of your control year after year but sometimes parents parent and a way to satisfy their own insecurity so that the child now becomes an emotional prop for them and they will never let the child grow in independence and it becomes frustrating for the child and the parents try to control every move and hold on to everything and and won't let anything go and now the child becomes frustrated because in them is built to become a man or woman they're built they're growing it's god's purpose it's god's plan in their life there's they they feel the need for independence they they feel the need to make decisions they feel the need to branch out and they have that need because that's god put that in there because they're growing to an independent position independent of you in the body in this world and something god wants to do in them and they can't stay attached to mom's apron strings until they're 24 and cut loose and sent into the world it happens by degrees and we've got to catch the transition and help nurture our children through that but if we don't let them when we oh we're overbearing and over controlling as they come into those teenage years and all of a sudden we're going to create a frustration inside of them and it's go they're going to blow up they're going to blow up and then we'll blame them for the blow up but that's not what the apostle paul did the apostle paul didn't blame the children he blamed the parent the fathers rather provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged or broken spirited we got to be careful that we let that child grow let them make decisions let them gain an independence we should be teaching them how to work from the time they're little get them out and work they should know how to work they should know how to fill out paperwork amen they should be able to balance a checkbook i'm amazed that 16 17 18 year old kids they can't balance a checkbook they don't understand the basics of managing money they why because mom and dad do everything for them and have taught them nothing because they act like they're going to stay with them for the rest of their lives but we realize we're not training them to stay with us the rest of their lives we're training them to go fulfill god's purpose for them so they they need to know they need to be trained they need to be taught and they need to be given the chance to do it they need to be given some liberty guess what they don't always get it right they'll make some mistakes along the way but they how else are they going to learn i want to look at a quote here this is a story brother branham tells about his family and i think it takes this scripture and it puts it into perspective and i just want to talk about this out of questions and answers from 1964. brother bram says i just went through the experience with my rebecca she just committed to to god she was 17 getting ready to turn 18. so i just committed to god when she got to be a little teen tiani and she was going with some girl when we first went out there going run over to some girl's house taking music lessons and this girl i come by one day and here this girl was sitting there at the piano playing rock and roll well that was just enough for me so i told her to stay away from over there and then she said well it's the only place i got to take music you know how tea annie's get and i said every kid has to go through that practically everyone goes through that age you did i did and we got to think their thoughts think of what brother ben i'm saying he's not saying she should have never said that she shouldn't have he is telling the parent to try to understand the child you have to think their thoughts so then a few days after that her mother got after her for something and she sassed her now that's not rebecca at all took off and slammed the door almost and knocked the things off the wall went to school now i ought to have seemingly oh i love that word seemingly i ought to have seemingly just taken my belt off and followed her out there in the yard and brought her back with warps around her see but i thought wait a minute i got to think 18 year old thoughts see now i said mother i know that she started to cry me to i said i know you've done all you can do i've done all i can do now if it's out of our hands we have to take the next step further says i said well look honey now you've got to listen to me it's hard for you to do this i'm your husband but people drive across the nations and around for just a few words of advice now i talked to her the other day and she just walked away from me now becky never did do that to me you ever had that were you trying to talk to your children they just walk away from you does that do to your blood pressure what does it do to your adrenal glands your fight-or-flight syndrome right but that's the moment you can provoke them to anger right there or you can have understanding and you can try you can try to train them through this to become independent adults usually that's what this battle is over there's a struggle for independence because god put it there and there there is a resistance to their independence sometimes it's righteous they can't go and be as free as they want to free be free you've got to hold them back but sometimes you're holding them back too long and they should be more free usually this struggle is all about how much independence and it's going to take some real leadership from the holy ghost for you mom and dad and especially dad taking some real leadership to know where that child's at amen and not be overbearing or controlling and not provoke them unto wrath but find out god where am i where is the place that i should be letting them go and giving them freedom and holding them back because most of the time these these situations are based off of that he said now becky never did do that to me and when her mother said something about it she slammed the door and said you expect me to sit here and be a wallflower all my life and blam me she slammed the door and went out that was the devil boy that was easy to diagnose that was the devil but his daughter wasn't the devil it was the devil influencing her he didn't wage war against his daughter he's going to wage war against that devil see we're coming to a different level this isn't where you jerk them up swat them on the tail and tell them never to do it again we should have already been through that you should already be past that i mean you go to you go to when you've got a toddler you go to multiple multiple spankings per day sometimes multiple per hour in certain seasons then as they move up you're going into a handful per week then a handful per month and then a handful per year and then you're done chastising is not going to work anymore you see the time to to take them and deal with that right there that time has passed we're in a different stage and we need to awaken ourselves to it take the prophet as our example so now that that was the devil you know what he didn't do he didn't go tell his daughter you're possessed of an evil spirit that could provoke them to anger he didn't lay hands on her and cast a demon out he was the one with the understanding he wasn't asking her to have the understanding he was the one who's having the understanding further down he says and then when she started that and i took me to i took me to about an hour i said mita take your hands off me that's my kid i said isn't it mine too all right i said if she was dying this morning you'd have to commit her to god for eternal destination why can't we commit her to god now for her earthly journey and she said well that's my kid i said it's mine too i said now can you take your me not say anything to her i said i never said that will quit scolding her just advise her oh brother branham caught something later on he's going to tell his wife this is of the lord brother branham caught this he wasn't compromising he wasn't letting her get away with stuff brother branham later told his wife that the vice he gave her was of the lord now that doesn't mean every time your child back talks you you take your hands off but you have to be led of the lord we have to be sensitive to the spirit we have to be the adult we have to be the one who's born again of the holy ghost we have to be the one leading not provoking the anger he said i never said that we'll quit scolding her just advise her she needs a buddy and you're the only one to be her buddy you and i we're her parents these kids today needs a buddy they don't need a drill sergeant they don't need a correction officer they don't need a parole officer right do you get the point they need an advocate they need one who can stand alongside and help them through they need one that can advise them they need one that can keep their calm when the when the teenager can't keep their calm they need a father who'll keep his calm when they're not born again yet they need somebody who's born again already and to overshadow and to take care of them and to be there to work out a plan of redemption for them amen they don't need a parole officer they don't need a corrections officer they understand do they get so they're wrong yes they need to be told they're wrong but they need advice they need correction and they need correction as a young adult not correction as a five-year-old they don't need an 11-year-old correction they need a 16 17 18 19 20 year old 21 year old kind of correction you have to understand as things change just because they turn 13 don't mean you turn them over but between 13 and 19 is a huge progress they come in one way and they go out another way amen and your relationship should be changing with them and your approach to them should be changing along the way it's not going to be the same at 13 and 19. and it won't be the same for every child because there's different maturity levels there's different abilities and then they progress in maturity in different ways so you've got to be led of the spirit of god all the time and be prayed up because it's a crucial time to get them through this time amen so that they and they and you can stay in contact with one another so that you can advise them if not if we don't handle the situation right we get ourselves in a situation where the relationship is so broken you can't even give a word of advice and that's a bad place to be we don't want to provoke them to anger so that they be discouraged when you say something to your child and they turn around and smirnoff back to you and say something very mean and very hurtful and walk away from you what do you think it does to them we always think about what it does to me how can they talk to me that way how could they say those things don't they know how how rebellious and how hurtful that is and all we're thinking about is me me me but you know every time that child stood in the face of his dad or his mom and said hateful rude mean things and then walked away you know it killed them you know it did damage to the inside of that teenager and sometimes we can't get past the way it made us feel to recognize that they need an advocate right now they need a buddy they don't need a drill sergeant see right now i'm preaching to myself just as much as anybody else because i've we've got to make these transitions we've got to see what the prophet told us and we've got to say what i'm doing isn't working god you got to show me what works amen we're not exempt and some of us you know we have different temperaments and the child with a different temperament and and it's a different mixture every time and and some go one way and some go the other some like i said will be easy some will be difficult but it's going to take the leading of god leading through a holy ghost-filled parent amen not not not just condemning not just chastening not just scolding all the time but they need a buddy they need an advocate they need somebody that will advise so we've got to maintain the relationship and we've got to understand says she needs a buddy and you're the one to be her buddy you and i we're her parents these kids today needs a buddy i'm so glad we had a prophet i mean he'll talk about that old mammy taking a a barrel slat and wearing that girl out he'll talk about this and he'll talk about that but it'll also open up and tell you exactly what went down in his home so we're not too much this way and too much that way so that we can come right down the middle of the room these kids today needs a buddy if they had a mother and a father would stay home and take care of them instead of out here and bar room running around all night and things like that wouldn't have a juvenile delinquency see on down paragraph 130 he says so we there got down on our knees and committed it to god they didn't let it go they didn't ignore it they got down on their knees together mom and dad and committed it to the lord committed it to god i said i know she's 18 years old we'll be in a few days and she and the girl that age will think about boyfriends and we've kept her in said i never wanted to see her get married i want to put her in the office there to do work i want to see her filled with the spirit and live like them and well we all want that she said well we can't do that said she just won't listen to it i said wait a minute we've raised her all we can now put her in the hands of god commit her and i said then when she does anything say becky darling mother don't want you to do that but i'm your pal i'll stick by you see let her know that you love her she's going to get somebody to love her and it might be the wrong woman see i said you be the woman that does the loving i said honey that sounds kind of crude but people come everywhere and sit on personal interviews and things i said i'm so common we're common to one another because we're husband and wife but we never let that happen you must remember this is in the name of the lord praise god this is in the name of the lord you mean in the name of the lord i can be my child's buddy that's what god led the prophet to do for his daughter what will he lead us to do i don't know we should pray about it and find out what god wants she said all right we got down and committed it to god said we'd take our hands off of it that afternoon she came in she said well i guess you're still saying i ain't going over there me he said no i never said nothing about him he said you know mother don't want you to do that and you know what like to kill your daddy when he heard you up there playing that boogie woogie music over what it was with that girl so now he didn't want you to do that and we don't want you to do that becky but we just committed it to the lord i want you to know we love you whatever you do we still love you she hollered said i'm going anyhow let her spout off a little bit she hollered and said i'm going anyhow said all right dear so went ahead said all right i'll have supper ready when you get back she never did go no she never went since see not long after that she met george george is a christian that settled it then she's trying to listen she's trying to tell mrs wood about it the other day she said oh i got awful wild so she just said daddy and mother committed me to the lord said awful wild but that was wild to us we don't want to get any wilder than that that was wild to us but you see brother branham was led of the lord to take an action different than the initial reaction to have an understanding and to stay in his position see you have a father or a mother that's in a position of leadership over a home and you have a teenager they're moving up in maturity but they're still under this head chin but what happens is because of teenage passions and because of teenage hormones and because of this frustration between wanting freedom and not having freedom and it's a natural thing that's happening inside and because of that frustration they may spout off and be disrespectful and say things and immediately we move out of our position and put ourselves down on a teenage position and start arguing with a teenager i know i'm not the only one guilty of that what happened we left our position when we left our position we left our power but what brother branham did is he didn't take the devil's bait because when she slammed the door that was the devil and brother branham didn't get anointed by the devil to go in there and slam it again right sometimes we catch each other's anointing i'm not the only one guilty of that either and we've got to remember i'm the high priest of this home they can act the way they want that devil can rise to rise up but i have the authority and power to shut it down but i can't shut it down down here i have to stay here i can't let my emotions i can't let the hurtful words i can't let all this drag me down to the same level as my teenager i have to stay in my position and if i stay in my position it means i may have to let them run their mouth for a little bit and move off the scene and then i'll go take spiritual authority over what's happening in my home because there's a power that comes in our position and brother branham just exercised that with his wife they got down on the knees and they committed to god they didn't have to go toe-to-toe with a teenager that was being influenced by an evil spirit they could go above that and they could go to the throne of the father and say this is my child and i'm committing this child to you see we have to understand this is spiritual warfare we got to stay in our position as mothers and fathers amen and not get sucked down to verbal combat and the reason we get into verbal combat is always selfishness because of the way that child made us feel we got frustrated we got anger we were hurt they hurt our feelings i'm also not the only one guilty of that i'm not going to raise hands because it's unanimous what we need is to take the cue from the prophet and say god i want to take dominion over the situation and i want to nurture and lead that tenure all the way through all the way through as long as as i've got this influence over them and they're in my home i want to lead them all the way through god give me wisdom in this situation sometimes we just got to let the let the child talk it doesn't matter how wrong it is you can always correct things later some things don't have to be dealt with right then don't forget you're in control of their whole life you know sometimes we get pulled from this position down to this position and get into verbal combat that's never going to work what we need to do is stay in our position and let the let them spout off mouth off act rebellious say hurtful things whatever we go and pray about it but then the next time they need a ride over to a friend's house all you have to say is no calm not angry hey dad so-and-so wants me to come over i want to go over to sister so-and-so's house they're having some fellowship i'm sorry sweetheart i don't really feel like taking you over there because of the way you spoke to me you're not fighting you're not arguing you're in control you're in your place you don't have to fight back we don't have to get sucked down to the level of a 16 year old we can stay on our spot so there's all kinds of different ways to deal with the situation some things have to be corrected some things you can't let it go like brother branham did some things have to be corrected but you're in total control of the correction they live in your house they're probably on your cell phone plan it's probably your money that they sustained them with early on when they first start driving they're probably driving your car if they're not driving they're probably asking you to drive them who says you have to you have to take disrespect and hatefulness and still drive them to their friend's house who's running the show then you can stay calm we can stay in control we if there has to be correction we can have calm correction that hits them where it hurts the most without yelling without screaming without getting into verbal combat without any kind of altercation at all oh they might get upset and go slam the door again it doesn't matter they're still not going they'll eventually learn that if i want to do what i want to do i've got to do what mom and dad wants me to do or else i'm going to be my own prisoner so not everything has to be we'll just let it go no some things you can't let go some things have to be dealt with even when they're teenagers but stay in position stay here to deal with it don't come down here to deal with it stay mom and dad stay the high priest of the home stay the king of your castle pass down righteous judgment that makes good sense and you don't have to explain yourself and you don't have to debate and there's no court session they're not they're not defending themselves on the court of law you're the king you made the decision don't get sucked in debate because all it's going to do is is gender an argument which is going to cause you to provoke your child to wrath stay in control stay calm make sound decisions don't get sucked in when the devil's trying to influence a weaker vessel don't get sucked in to something that's going to bring you out of your lofty position down to a lower position and then you're getting caught in the same influence of the same spirit we gotta we gotta think differently but the man told his wife what she needs now is a buddy and you're the one to be your buddy he said it's in the name of the lord he had caught an inspiration he knew what to do he committed to god and they told her you can go but we don't want you to do and it all nearly killed your dad we don't want you to that's not right but i still love you anyhow and i'll have supper ready when you get back she never went and never went again praise be to god i'd rather work by inspiration of the holy ghost than any psychology book in the world god knows how to anoint the parent that he placed that child under you're the one he'll deal with to deal with that child you just have to have a relationship with god and stay tuned in that's why applying the token is so much more than after the fact hopes that it'll fix a situation that's already gone awry but apply the token before the child's born and keep the token applied the entire time that child's in your house because he says because it'll take an effect on them what the token life in the home will have an effect and influence over that child their whole life don't wait till they've already gone awry then try to apply the token apply the token before you ever bring them home from the hospital and keep it applied the entire time and it will take an effect and we have to live that's why mom and dad have to live a consecrated holy life or else we get sucked in to these little evil things and we gotta stop getting sucked into these things this quote did me a world of good understanding i'd like to wrap up with this the message thy house 1961. usually who would you get a teenager to sit around and listen to someone preach and talk why they'd be out and gone somewhere little girls like that brother branham was complimenting the teenagers that were sitting and listening to his preaching so where do you get teenagers to sit and listen like that i want to ask you the same question where do you get teenagers to sit and listen to two and two and a half hour sermons where in the world is it no no no fun activity no game just preaching they'd be outgoing somewhere little girls like that i said to brother fred his kids they can just hear me say one thing that's wrong then they're they're ready to stop it right now you see brother said this is wrong they're ready to stop it right then and set with the highest respect instead of being out of hot rotting rambling around they when they hear you speak about the gospel they're ready to sit right there and listen see now i know we all think our kids as renegades and things like that but we must stop that i believe that we must remember that these kids are the best kids in the world because they're our children and we claim them for god see what he's teaching his congregation stop thinking they're bad kids they're not bad kids we don't have any bad kids here you know just because a child hits that stage where they're struggling for that independence and there's a little power struggle in the house of independence that's not uncommon that's not far from being normal that doesn't make them evil that doesn't make them bad kids they just need special leadership and guidance through that transition in life amen they need a parent that can understand what's happening and be led of the lord to lead them through that time but that's a normal thing and it's a healthy thing in many ways but they're not bad we got to remember these are the best kids in the whole world because we've committed them to god we've committed them many of us we've brought them as infants we brought them to the altar and we put them in the hands of a minister so that minister could take and dedicate that child to the lord we have to have faith in what we did right then we don't do that out of tradition we don't we don't do that just because everybody wants to see the cute baby in the cute outfit that has nothing to do with why we're bringing them up we're bringing them up because we want to dedicate this child to the lord that the lord will look after this life because we realize as parents will fail we realize we'll get things wrong we're going to make mistakes along the way but we commit this life to you and we commit ourselves to you to use us to shape this life but where we fail we're trusting in you to keep this life and we've got to have confidence in that prayer of dedication we got to believe it it's don't don't ever come and dedicate a baby just out of tradition do it with full faith in your heart then i'm asking god if i dedicate this child that god will keep this child all the days of its life and believe it when things go wrong go back to your dedication when things get rough go back to the dedication and say god we dedicated this son we dedicated this girl to you in the name of the lord and we're trusting you to help us in this time we trusted you to keep them from the time they're in heaven and we need you now god but we're trusting that when we committed that child to you that you are going to take control we've got to live by faith not by reasoning back by faith and we got to believe that we got the best kids in the world if you don't believe that go to walmart someday and just stand there and watch for a few minutes go up to somebody randomly at work and ask them to take out kids you have any teenagers tell me about your teenagers and five minutes into the conversation you're going to be thanking god for the children you have so brother ben's teaching his congregation to change your attitude amen and start realizing that we've got the best kids on the planet they've been dedicated to the lord they'll sit and listen to preaching for two and three hours amen they'll come service after service they'll go to youth meetings not to play games but to hear preaching they got preaching on wednesday preaching on sunday and then they'll go on a friday two times a month to hear more preaching we've got the best kids in the whole world if they hit a struggle in their life for independence and they don't know they're a little frustrated and they don't know if they should be free to do this or not free to do that and they come into hey they're still the best kids in the whole world that didn't change anything and our attitude towards them is gonna it's going to change their attitude towards us fathers provoke not your children to wrath if you talk about them like they're the best and you treat them like they're the best what do you think is going to happen he goes on this quote and he says now your salvation will not save that child but now paul said believe in the lord jesus christ and thy and thy house shall be saved now what did he mean by that he didn't mean that because they they were saved that their house would be saved with it he meant this that because they had if he had enough faith to be saved himself his same amount of faith that he had for himself would work for his children by faith not hope faith see what i mean now i've got my children there's my little son joseph and billy sarah rebecca no no i want to see each one of them a worker in the gospel doing something i want to see them saved and filled with the holy ghost now i've committed them to god and say i'm holding on to god for them and i believe they're going to be saved every one of them see i believe they're going to be saved and i'll have them on the other side and i don't believe my salvation will save them no but my faith in god will do it you see my faith believing god will do it and will cause them to come to christ and i believe that's where you people praying for your children and that's the reason your children has the manners and the real lady and gentlemen in this wild age that we're living in yet they have the part about them that's the best i know of any kids see well i think the reason of that is because it's your prayers for them and you've committed them to god and holding on oh praise be to god why are they the best kids in the whole world because we've dedicated them to the lord we raise them in the nurture and admonition of the lord and we're holding on to god for the kids amen and we're believing that god's working with them and you can see god's working with them amen will they will they have a little frustration periods in their life maybe well they hit things that are an impasse that you just can't agree on and it creates difficulty probably but that doesn't change the fact that they're the best kids in the world deal with them you guys are the best kids in the world not just my five all of you why because you love the lord it's obvious because you want to serve him nobody's forced you to come up and sit on the front row you did that of your own choice nobody's forcing you to go to use me you do have your own choice nobody's forcing you to raise your hands and sing nobody's forcing you to open your mouth and sing praises to the lord nobody's forcing you to say amen to the word you're doing that of your own free choice why because you've been dedicated to the lord because you've got parents that are holding on for you amen and you're the best kids in the world how many believe they're the best kids in the world amen now let's treat them that way amen in the frustrations let's treat them like the best kids in the world when they have to be corrected you just corrected one of the best kids in the whole world when there has to be a punishment hey you've just punished one of the best kids in the whole world you see how it changes your whole mode of thinking they're not rebels they're not wild amen i would take the troubles that we have over anybody else's with their teenagers in the whole planet we may think we have a rough time you know brother bram said his becky was telling mrs wood you know i got real wild usually that's about as wild as it gets around here and if that's as wild as it gets i say thank god thank you lord jesus there's a different atmosphere there's something the word is doing there's something that commitment is doing when they're committed to god and parents are holding on for their kids it is making a difference don't lose faith in that in the midst of a conflict don't lose faith in everything we just talked about in the midst of a power struggle don't lose faith and confidence the same faith you have right now in them have it in the middle of a conflict and it'll change our attitude it'll change our approach it'll change everything like i said this isn't exhaustive we could say a lot more things about teenagers but this is the thing that god laid on my heart if you've got a teenage son or daughter that's here in the assembly with you worshiping god oh you should you should thank god every day if you've got a child amen and maybe they they've left and man they've gone to do their thing but you committed them to god and you're holding the god for them you thank god for them every day amen because it's your faith and commitment if they're ever going to come back it's your faith and holding on and commitment that's going to bring them back we've got to hold on with faith not through a lost cause there is no lost cause there is no hopeless situation there is no lost cause we've dedicated these children to the lord we've dedicated ourselves to the lord and we're holding on for them because they're the best kids because they're the kids that have been dedicated by the bride of jesus christ to the living god tell me where a better kid is in the whole world amen raise up an assembly of believers raised up in a home of believers i don't care what they're doing now they're the best kids in the whole world got to have faith got to believe god's going to do something when the devil takes all of our faith and robs us of even hope amen then nothing's happening but if god can come and fan the fames of flames of faith again amen and you can renew that faith you had the day you dedicated them to the lord amen faith is what moves the mountain faith is what changes circumstances we got to believe we love our children i just want to say as a pastor i love you kids i love the teenagers and the young adults and the little toddlers and the babies we dedicate i love you all you're the best kids in the whole world don't let anybody tell you different you're amazing you're amazing to watch you're amazing to see to watch you worship to watch you love the lord to watch you sing in sunday school it's amazing we understand there's struggles in life and there's things that happen and i know even if you rebel against mom and dad you regret it just as bad as they regret it you go back in your room and cry just as hard as mom went to her room and cried nobody wins but if you'll commit yourself to stay under headship and to obey mom and dad and mom and dad can commit themselves to stay in headship and lead and guide you and be your buddy everything's going to be just fine everything's going to be all right you're going to wind up moving into independence you're going to wind up and living the life god called you to you're going to wind up with your own home and your own family and your own position in the church you're going to wind up there just trust the lord trust the position he's put you in watch god work everything's working everything's moving right on time nothing's out of kilter everything's going to be fine god bless you let's all stand musicians if you could come please and brother jim this is bow our hearts their heavenly father we thank you lord jesus lord your word is so amazing to us lord god the directions you lead us in sometimes lord are so astounding so different sometimes in our
