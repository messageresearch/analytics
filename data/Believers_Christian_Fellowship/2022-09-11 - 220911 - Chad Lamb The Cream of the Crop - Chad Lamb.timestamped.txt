[10:54] turn in our Bibles to the Book of

[10:58] our scripture I have a very important
[11:00] announcement to make
[11:02] remember Frank if you could pull up the
[11:04] picture
[11:05] brother Blake and sister Emily we're
[11:07] blessed with the little baby boy Richard
[11:09] Henry lamb born Friday evening so we're
[11:13] just a little bit excited
[11:15] and so we thank God for that and uh the
[11:18] baby and the mommy are doing really well
[11:20] so appreciate everybody's prayers and
[11:23] they intend to keep the family tradition
[11:25] of calling him by his middle name so
[11:27] he'll be little Henry he's the fourth in
[11:31] that line my dad was Richard J I'm
[11:33] Richard Chad Blake is Richard Blake and
[11:35] now we have Richard Henry so may God
[11:38] bless him
[11:39] also I want to say sister k
[11:42] Mr K Preston uh Preston me and Angie
[11:45] want to congratulate you and wish you a
[11:47] happy Grandparents Day
[11:50] praise God
[11:52] in case you didn't know today is
[11:54] officially Grandparents Day
[11:56] I didn't know that one of my children
[11:57] told me and I looked it up and if Google
[11:59] is correct
[12:01] today is Grandparents Day I said praise
[12:04] the lord we should have a party
[12:07] that's one of those holidays I wasn't I
[12:09] didn't pay much attention to but my
[12:11] feelings are changing somehow anyways
[12:14] God bless you while we're standing let's
[12:16] go to the word of God and look into
[12:17] revelation
[12:19] chapter 2
[12:22] verse 18.
[12:29] Revelation Chapter 2 Verse 18 and unto
[12:32] the angel of the church and thyatara
[12:34] write these things saith the Son of God
[12:36] who hath his eyes likened to a flame of
[12:38] fire and his feet are like fine brass
[12:41] I Know Thy works
[12:43] and charity and service and faith in thy
[12:47] patience and thy works and the last to
[12:49] be more than the first may God bless you
[12:52] as you take your seeds
[12:54] may God bless us as we look into his
[12:56] word
[12:59] I mean there's a
[13:01] there's a quote that Drew my attention
[13:03] to the scripture out of the church ages
[13:05] and I started looking at this in detail
[13:08] a couple days ago and I'm so thankful
[13:10] that God gave me an inspiration before
[13:12] everything unfolded so I could start
[13:14] looking because they kept sending me
[13:15] baby pictures yesterday and I said you
[13:18] guys are destroying me you're killing me
[13:21] I'm having a hard time I said if God
[13:23] doesn't help us we're just going to have
[13:25] nothing to preach we're just going to do
[13:26] a slideshow of Henry pictures
[13:29] and be one of those annoying
[13:30] grandparents that everybody cannot stand
[13:33] but thank God God before gave us an
[13:36] inspiration and a direction and it come
[13:39] out of thyatira which is an interesting
[13:41] period of time thyatira was the time of
[13:43] the dark ages for the church and it
[13:46] wasn't
[13:47] um it wasn't it was a time it was the
[13:49] lowest ebb for the true church but it
[13:52] wasn't the lowest ebb for the false
[13:54] church it was actually the highest amen
[13:56] so this is when the Catholic Church came
[13:58] to its greatest power was in in thyatira
[14:01] they ruled the world the Holy Roman
[14:03] Empire was in full swing they were
[14:05] entrenched in many other countries and
[14:07] and they were raising up Kings and
[14:09] taking down Kings they were at their
[14:11] highest or their peak in thyatira but
[14:13] the true church amen if you look at the
[14:15] restoration of the Bride tree those the
[14:17] stages of that insect those four stages
[14:19] has eaten it down to a stump it was
[14:22] almost completely gone the true faith
[14:25] and the True Believers were almost
[14:26] completely eradicated by the false Vine
[14:29] and so it was the dark ages for the
[14:31] truth dark ages for the true church amen
[14:34] but then they come out of there begin a
[14:37] a Protestant reformation and then the
[14:39] the Protestant move took off and there
[14:41] was a restoration of the Bride tree to
[14:43] come to the end time when she would come
[14:45] back to being all that she was intended
[14:47] to do and and the entirely became an
[14:50] interesting study for me I'm not going
[14:52] to get into it we've talked about it
[14:54] before but when you come to the end of
[14:58] laodicea now that Protestant movement
[15:00] has done everything the Catholic Church
[15:02] did in the beginning and so what looked
[15:05] like it was going to be a Protestant
[15:06] Reformation it began the same cycle of
[15:10] corruption and at the end of laodicean
[15:12] church age it will Unite with the
[15:13] Catholic church and go right back to
[15:15] being what it was in thyatira a dominant
[15:18] ruling force that will try to eradicate
[15:20] the truth
[15:21] so there's like a double cycle a cycle
[15:23] for the Catholics and the cycle for the
[15:25] Protestants but at the end of the
[15:26] Protestant cycle comes right back to
[15:28] thyatira amen because we go into
[15:30] darkness because brother manham showed
[15:32] us that that in laodicea they've gone
[15:34] into absolute apostasy amen there's no
[15:36] light there anymore all the light has
[15:38] moved out and gathered into the bride in
[15:41] this last time so it's another Dark Age
[15:43] for the church but it's not a dark age
[15:45] for the bride this time
[15:48] so so that it's it's that's an
[15:50] interesting picture showing what
[15:52] thyatara was and here God comes and and
[15:57] is speaking in Revelation Chapter 2 and
[16:01] going to give an admonition and going to
[16:03] give an Accolade to the uh thyatarian
[16:06] Church age he says in verse 19 I Know
[16:09] Thy Works in thy charity in service and
[16:11] faith in thy patience and thy works and
[16:14] thy last to be more than the first and I
[16:17] was reading in the church age book in
[16:19] the in the thyatarian church age and
[16:20] brother Branham says this he said surely
[16:23] these thyart iron saints were the cream
[16:25] of the crop
[16:26] full of the Holy Ghost in faith created
[16:29] into good works showing forth his praise
[16:31] holding not their lives dear unto
[16:33] themselves but gladly giving their all
[16:36] as a Sweet Sacrifice unto the Lord
[16:39] when I came across this I said uh if the
[16:43] prophet of God can say surely these thot
[16:46] iron saints were the cream of the crop
[16:48] I want to know what makes them the cream
[16:50] of the crop because I believe in the end
[16:52] time what we're going to have is a bride
[16:55] that's the cream of the crop amen it's
[16:57] coming back so when the prophet of God
[16:59] says the tire Tyrant saints were the
[17:01] cream of the crop what made them the
[17:03] cream of the crop why would the prophet
[17:05] say this about these certain Believers
[17:07] so I went back and began to read and
[17:09] begin to study and and ask myself why
[17:12] would he say the thyatine saints were
[17:15] the cream of the crop and and I'm going
[17:17] to read some excerpts out of the church
[17:19] age book as we move forward so now you
[17:22] know my my my thought now you know the
[17:24] premise of my thought so the title today
[17:26] is the cream of the crop and how many
[17:28] would like to be the cream of the crop
[17:30] amen we will never put ourselves there
[17:32] it will be by the grace of God but if if
[17:35] that's what they could achieve in
[17:36] thyatira and that's what God wants to
[17:38] achieve in a bride in the end time I say
[17:40] God I want to be part of that amen so
[17:42] how did you achieve it in the Saints
[17:44] entire attire that's how you'll achieve
[17:46] it in the Saints at the end time amen
[17:48] he says now this is out of the church
[17:51] age book fire time Church age now works
[17:53] will never take the place of faith in
[17:55] God for salvation
[17:57] I want to lay that down as a principle
[18:00] it's important that brother Brown says
[18:01] this in thyatira because the tire and
[18:04] church age was salvation by works by
[18:06] adapting to the works of the church if
[18:09] you do what the church says you'll be
[18:10] saved amen and it came to its peak their
[18:13] entire attire belonging to the church
[18:15] and obeying the church became the means
[18:18] of Salvation in that day so Brethren
[18:20] said Works will never take the place of
[18:22] faith in God for our salvation
[18:27] what what's our Salvation based on faith
[18:30] in God
[18:31] not works faith and gone
[18:33] but works will show forth our faith
[18:36] already placed in him
[18:38] good works won't save you but they will
[18:41] come forth out of a saved life as fruit
[18:43] unto the Lord so the the the the
[18:46] statement that Christ makes in
[18:49] Revelation Chapter 2 says I Know Thy
[18:51] works this was an age that was steeped
[18:54] in Works traditional Works based off the
[18:56] church's order for salvation but he's
[18:59] speaking to the True Vine and he says I
[19:01] know your works you have true works amen
[19:04] because true works are not works that
[19:06] are done for salvation true works are
[19:08] done are works that are based off faith
[19:11] in God Amen they're an outcropping of
[19:13] our faith so so in the age of Works he's
[19:17] pointing to a people who have genuine
[19:19] true works
[19:22] God's Works won't save you
[19:25] you got that
[19:27] God's Works won't save you but they will
[19:29] come forth out of a saved life as fruit
[19:31] unto the Lord I believe in good works
[19:33] even if a man is not saved he ought to
[19:36] do good works and do the best he can
[19:37] what is horrible in the sight of God is
[19:40] for men to do evil works and then say
[19:42] that they are doing the will of the Lord
[19:44] that is what the Bishops and popes and
[19:46] the hierarchy of Rome were doing they
[19:48] were killing maiming and doing all
[19:50] manner of evil In The Name Of The Lord
[19:53] they lived out lives exactly opposite to
[19:56] what the word teaches
[19:57] in that evil day those True Believers
[20:00] Shone like a light in a dark place as
[20:02] they continually did good for they
[20:04] returned cursing with blessing and did
[20:06] the truth to honor God even though many
[20:08] died for him
[20:10] in this verse he is commending his
[20:13] children because they were living
[20:14] changed lives their Works testified to a
[20:18] new spirit within men saw their good
[20:20] works and glorified God yes sir if you
[20:22] are a Christian you are going to do what
[20:25] is right your Works will show that your
[20:27] heart is right and it won't be something
[20:29] that you put on for you will do his will
[20:32] when no one but God sees you
[20:35] oh this is such an important statement
[20:37] and it gets down to the heart of the
[20:39] matter you will do the will you you you
[20:42] will do his will when no one but God
[20:45] sees you and you will do his will even
[20:47] if it cost you your life
[20:50] this is what God was pointing to in the
[20:53] thyatarian church age amen they were
[20:55] they were serving God in this age not
[20:58] for benefits because in this age there
[21:00] wasn't a lot that you could point to in
[21:02] the way of benefits this was the ox age
[21:05] this is when they had to bear under the
[21:07] slaughter and the persecution of the
[21:09] church they were scattered many times
[21:11] not allowed to assemble their property
[21:13] with taken they were in prison they were
[21:15] tortured they were killed all kinds of
[21:17] terrible things were happening to them
[21:18] but they maintained good works through
[21:21] it all they kept serving and loving God
[21:23] through every obstacle and God was
[21:25] pointing out I'm recognizing your works
[21:28] because they're not to get you somewhere
[21:30] because the more you serve God in that
[21:32] day the greater the persecution became
[21:36] and listen and we we live in a day where
[21:39] that which is evil is called good and
[21:41] that which is good is called evil and
[21:43] it's getting worse amen we're in the
[21:45] phase now in the world where there is an
[21:49] ultra tolerance being preached where we
[21:51] tolerate everything
[21:53] but following Ultra tolerance is an
[21:56] ultra persecution for anybody that
[21:58] doesn't follow in the path of ultra
[22:00] tolerance
[22:01] so when we cannot accept amen
[22:04] self-identified genders when we can't
[22:06] accept at wrong marriages we can't
[22:09] accept homosexuality and transgenderism
[22:11] and all of these things that's being
[22:13] pushed when it can't be accepted and
[22:15] even forms of false worship and false
[22:17] religion can't be accepted amen that
[22:20] that that that that Ultra anything goes
[22:23] attitude will then turn on the very ones
[22:26] that don't go with the flow and make
[22:28] everything okay amen so the more you
[22:31] worship God Amen the more you do his
[22:34] works the more you obey him could bring
[22:36] greater persecution greater trials
[22:39] greater pressure
[22:41] amen so it'll be tested I don't know how
[22:45] I don't know I'm making no predictions I
[22:47] have no idea what will happen in the
[22:48] future but you can see the stages being
[22:50] set you can see the the atmosphere all
[22:53] around as as everything goes I mean
[22:56] people will won't make a stand on no
[22:58] subject whatsoever amen they're afraid
[23:01] to offend they they won't even their
[23:03] children are now not even declaring
[23:05] themselves male or female but they're
[23:06] declaring themselves as animals they're
[23:08] identifying as animals and a school
[23:10] school board won't do anything about it
[23:12] a principal won't do anything about it
[23:13] and the parents won't do anything about
[23:15] it they'll tolerate it because they've
[23:17] lost their ability to say what is right
[23:19] and what is wrong
[23:21] so this world has lost its ability to
[23:24] declare right and to declare wrong amen
[23:27] but we're standing upon the word of God
[23:29] and the word of God is always right and
[23:31] anything contrary to it is always wrong
[23:33] amen now it's not a matter of opinion or
[23:36] feeling or personal desire or even our
[23:39] raising or it's come back to the word
[23:41] versus the whole world Amen
[23:46] amen and so if it was a dark age
[23:50] entire it's a Dark Age now
[23:54] later sin has gone into total apostasy
[23:57] declared by an eclipse of the moon where
[24:00] the seventh there wasn't even a seventh
[24:02] picture in the paper there was only six
[24:04] showing the phases of the church ages
[24:07] but when it came to that seventh brother
[24:09] man said why was there no seventh
[24:10] picture because it was a total blackout
[24:12] there was nothing to take a picture of
[24:14] Amen when brother Branham preached the
[24:16] the church ages in 1960. he preaches the
[24:20] church ages and he draws on the board up
[24:23] front the pictures that you see the
[24:25] circles with the Shaded part and light
[24:27] part showing the light diminishing over
[24:29] time and then through thyatira almost
[24:32] being wiped out then he shows the light
[24:34] growing back amen but at the end of the
[24:36] lay of sin he Slants it because it ends
[24:39] in darkness so he showed that God came
[24:41] down and confirmed it on the back wall
[24:43] of the Tabernacle and showed the same
[24:46] cycle of seven uh moons just like was on
[24:49] the platform so it was on the platform
[24:50] was confirmed in the back
[24:53] but after the preaching of the seals
[24:56] amen we come down to I believe it was
[24:58] 1964 when the pope is going to leave
[25:01] Rome and he's going he's going to leave
[25:03] Rome and he's going to go to Jerusalem
[25:05] and he's going to come to the United
[25:06] States at that time there's a blackout
[25:08] of the Moon that brother Bennett says
[25:10] was sent across the papers everywhere
[25:12] and there there's only six pictures
[25:13] there's not a seventh he said God showed
[25:16] it in the sky only now after the
[25:18] preaching of the seals he doesn't show
[25:20] any sliver of light left in laodicea he
[25:24] is outside he's been put out from the
[25:26] church now to come to light you have to
[25:28] go out and Unite with him so there's
[25:30] another Dark Age upon us friends
[25:33] a Dark Age and listen and thigh attire
[25:36] in the Dark Age we don't want to get in
[25:38] our minds that the Dark Age was a
[25:40] non-religious age
[25:43] it wasn't dark because of barbarism it
[25:45] wasn't dark because of heathenism Amen
[25:47] it was dark because of false light false
[25:50] religion was tramping out all the True
[25:53] Light it was dark because the truth was
[25:55] subdued and the false was was in full
[25:58] Glory Full manifestation it was a dark
[26:01] age because the false light was ruling
[26:04] so it wasn't that there was no religion
[26:06] the church was growing the church was
[26:08] powerful amen the the number of members
[26:11] were increasing it wasn't dark because
[26:14] there was no religion
[26:16] it was dark because there was a minimal
[26:19] amount of True Light
[26:22] and we're here
[26:24] where the churches of laodicea have went
[26:27] into absolute Darkness
[26:30] but no scaling back of religion
[26:34] no scaling back of meetings and churches
[26:36] and all of that but an absolute Darkness
[26:39] because they refused the light
[26:43] so in this time of Darkness
[26:46] in this time of Darkness the fire time
[26:48] Believers were the cream of the crop
[26:52] because
[26:54] their service to God was not rewarded by
[26:58] more blessings and material Goods
[27:01] they didn't get an easier life they
[27:04] didn't get better finances a better
[27:05] house better families many times it
[27:08] broke up their families
[27:10] it didn't bring peace to them many times
[27:12] it brought persecution and death and
[27:14] separation scattered churches scattered
[27:17] Fellowship broke open broke apart
[27:19] families imprisonment of that
[27:21] imprisonment of mom separation of the
[27:23] children they weren't serving God in
[27:25] this age for themselves they were
[27:27] serving God for God
[27:30] and to me when we look at what brother
[27:32] I'm saying that's what made them the
[27:34] cream of the crop because no matter what
[27:37] more service more evil more service
[27:40] meant more evil in return amen this was
[27:42] the age amen when the when the corn of
[27:45] wheat had to go into the ground and rot
[27:47] and die when this when the Bright Tree
[27:50] had to come down to a stump with no
[27:51] semblance of life when the ox had to
[27:54] bear under the persecution it wasn't the
[27:56] age of tremendous blessings and
[27:58] tremendous growth it was the age of
[27:59] Burden it was the age of sacrifice it
[28:02] was the age of death that would produce
[28:04] amen New Life
[28:07] and under that cycle they kept serving
[28:10] God anyways they kept serving God
[28:12] anyways they kept doing his works
[28:14] anyways
[28:17] praise God
[28:19] I'm going to read this last sentence in
[28:20] this quote and then continue on
[28:22] he said
[28:25] your Works will show that your heart is
[28:28] right and it won't be something that you
[28:30] put on for you will do his will when no
[28:32] one but God sees you
[28:34] and you will do his will even if it cost
[28:36] you your life
[28:39] says I know your love service faith and
[28:43] patience
[28:44] you will know that their love is placed
[28:46] between works and service and that is
[28:49] the right place for it because without
[28:51] love our works are not accepted before
[28:53] God
[28:55] and neither is our service
[28:58] see that's the fallacy of religion
[29:01] the whole religious concept is built on
[29:04] the fact that if I do religion I will in
[29:08] turn receive favor from God and receive
[29:10] salvation amen but but but what brother
[29:14] Branham is telling us is without love
[29:16] our works are not accepted before God
[29:18] and neither is our service all of those
[29:21] things we do for God and all of those
[29:23] services that we render and the works
[29:25] that we do if they're not done by love
[29:27] they are not accepted by God
[29:31] Paul speaking to the Corinthians said
[29:33] without love I am nothing and whatever I
[29:35] do is without profit unless it is done
[29:37] in love
[29:38] now you can see right here that these
[29:40] Believers weren't in that nicolaitan
[29:43] class that did works as a means of
[29:45] Salvation are to be admired by men
[29:50] I want that to soak in they were not of
[29:53] the nicolaitan class that did works as a
[29:56] means of salvation
[29:58] or to be admired by men
[30:01] we think that's such a terrible thing
[30:03] but I'm telling you that is prevalent
[30:08] in mankind
[30:10] this is the problem with humans
[30:13] this is the plague that plagues Humanity
[30:17] that's why the whole world is religious
[30:20] when you when brother Graham says when
[30:23] they came and they found the Native
[30:24] American Indians with no outside
[30:26] influence he was worshiping a great
[30:28] Creator God Amen when they find when
[30:30] they go to Africa when they go to the
[30:32] Aborigines in Australia they find that
[30:35] they're worshiping amen because man has
[30:38] as a desire to worship he has a need to
[30:40] worship it's put inside of man to
[30:42] worship something amen and many times
[30:45] the worship is is as motivated by self
[30:49] so we become the center of our worship
[30:52] so we worship we do works we do services
[30:55] in order to be saved and to go to heaven
[30:58] or to be admired in the class of people
[31:01] we associate with because everybody we
[31:03] associate with is religious so we become
[31:05] religious to fit in with everybody we
[31:07] associate with
[31:09] and it's so easy to happen growing up in
[31:11] a church amen you grow up in a church
[31:13] and your whole society your friends and
[31:16] everybody all believes the same way and
[31:18] it's so easy to keep doing the things of
[31:20] God thinking that it'll get me salvation
[31:23] and admiration from all my peers Hey
[31:26] listen I don't care who you are in this
[31:29] life everybody wants to fit in and
[31:31] everybody wants to be accepted
[31:34] is that true
[31:35] everybody wants to fit in and everybody
[31:38] wants to be accepted Amen in growing up
[31:41] religious amen can be very very
[31:43] dangerous because the motivation becomes
[31:46] self-centered and we become the central
[31:48] focus of all of our worship just like
[31:51] Cain Cain's worship was Center focused
[31:53] he focused on himself Abel's worship was
[31:56] God focused he wanted to serve God he
[31:59] wanted to do something for God something
[32:00] that would please God Cain's whole
[32:03] purpose and worship amen was to be
[32:05] accepted that's why he was so angry when
[32:07] he was rejected and Abel was accepted he
[32:10] wanted to be accepted but he wanted to
[32:11] be accepted according to what he thought
[32:13] was the best way to worship God what was
[32:16] most beautiful what was most accepted
[32:18] and when he was rejected instead of
[32:20] humbling himself and pleasing God Amen
[32:23] when he spoke with Abel he destroyed
[32:25] Abel because Abel's life was in
[32:28] contradiction to his life Abel's
[32:30] sincerity was a contradiction to his
[32:32] insincerity Abel's love was showing his
[32:35] lack of love
[32:38] so instead of repenting and dealing with
[32:40] himself he tried to destroy the one that
[32:42] was exposing him as wrong
[32:47] and so we have to be very careful and
[32:50] and to all of you growing up all you
[32:53] teenagers and you young adults and your
[32:55] children growing up it's a blessing to
[32:58] grow up in a family that loves God
[33:00] it's a blessing to grow up in an
[33:03] atmosphere that is focused on God and
[33:05] focused on his word it is a tremendous
[33:07] blessing to grow up sheltered from the
[33:09] things of the word world and taught the
[33:11] things of God but if you're not careful
[33:14] you will serve God for the acceptance of
[33:17] the people that you're around to please
[33:18] your parents to please your friends to
[33:20] fit in with the group and to obtain some
[33:23] sort of favor with God and to get
[33:25] something out of God and all of that at
[33:28] the end of the day amen is not going to
[33:30] get you where you want to be it is not
[33:32] accepted by God there's only one way to
[33:35] please God that's when you come to him
[33:36] out of a pure heart because you love him
[33:39] and him alone and regardless of what
[33:41] happens to you in return if everybody
[33:43] around you rejects you your parents kick
[33:45] you out amen all your friends reject you
[33:47] but you serve God because you love him
[33:49] that's the works that he's looking for
[33:52] that's the service that he'll accept
[33:54] amen he's not going to accept you going
[33:57] getting carried Downstream where
[33:58] everybody's going and staying in the
[34:00] boundaries Amen to be accepted that's
[34:02] not acceptable by God what's accepted by
[34:05] God is when you get real with God and
[34:06] say God I love you I want to love you
[34:09] more something in me has to change
[34:11] change Me O God to where I'm not doing
[34:14] service for people I'm not doing service
[34:16] for the ones I associate with I'm not
[34:18] doing it for a return of Merit I'm doing
[34:20] it based solely because I love you
[34:23] [Music]
[34:24] [Applause]
[34:25] amen and if we if we can't get to that
[34:28] point we need to dig a little deeper and
[34:30] dig a Little Deeper until we can get to
[34:31] the point where it says if Mom and Dad
[34:34] reject me if everybody rejects me if I
[34:37] get shipped off to another country by
[34:39] myself if I go with the same heart that
[34:41] I have now I will love him just the same
[34:44] there and serve him just the same there
[34:46] as I do today
[34:48] I'm not doing it because of the
[34:50] collective atmosphere I'm not doing it
[34:51] because of the collective thought I'm
[34:53] not doing this for acceptance I'm doing
[34:55] it because I love you God
[34:57] that was the blessing that the fire
[35:00] tyrants were under their motives were
[35:02] proved by the atmosphere
[35:05] that's why brother Bram could say they
[35:07] were the cream of the crop that's why
[35:09] they could get such an admonition amen
[35:11] from the Lord and and Revelation Chapter
[35:13] 2 because their motives were proved by
[35:17] the circumstances
[35:20] that's why
[35:21] in the day we live in with the peace
[35:23] that we have and the religious freedom
[35:26] that we have and the atmosphere we're in
[35:28] it's so much harder to judge our own
[35:31] motives
[35:34] if you could lose your job
[35:37] for for what you believed
[35:40] if you could lose your home you could
[35:42] have your property seized and you as a
[35:44] daddy could be arrested and separated
[35:46] from your family that atmosphere would
[35:49] prove your motive
[35:53] and so I think it behooves us to take
[35:55] some time to meditate and say God what
[35:57] in this atmosphere it's so hard to judge
[36:00] our motives
[36:01] that we need to take some time to
[36:03] meditate and say why am I doing what I'm
[36:06] doing
[36:07] why am I living the way I'm living why
[36:10] am I making the choices what is the
[36:13] motivation behind these choices what is
[36:15] the motivation behind all my actions
[36:19] because that's the only way that is the
[36:21] only way to have our works and our
[36:23] service accepted by God
[36:28] so
[36:29] I'll read this again
[36:32] you can see right here that these
[36:34] Believers weren't in that nicolaitan
[36:36] class that did works as a means of
[36:38] Salvation or to be admired by men
[36:41] they did their works out of the love of
[36:43] God that was shed abroad in their hearts
[36:45] by the Holy Ghost
[36:46] that love in their hearts was God's love
[36:48] for his own Jesus said by this shall all
[36:51] men know that you are my disciples that
[36:54] you have loved one for another
[36:56] the pagans who saw the lives of the
[36:58] early Christians said behold how they
[37:00] love each other John said in first John
[37:03] 4 7 everyone that loveth is born of God
[37:08] let's turn to First John chapter five
[37:09] let's just slip back a little bit here
[37:11] from Revelation to first John
[37:14] chapter 5.
[37:25] first John chapter 5.
[37:27] verse 1.
[37:32] whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
[37:35] Christ is born of God and everyone that
[37:37] loveth him that begotten loveth also him
[37:40] also that is begotten of him
[37:42] by this we know that we love the
[37:44] children of God when we love God and
[37:46] keep his Commandments for this is the
[37:48] love of God that we keep his
[37:49] Commandments and his Commandments are
[37:52] not Grievous to us
[37:54] for whatsoever is born of God overcome
[37:56] with the world and this is the victory
[37:57] that overcometh the world even our faith
[38:01] so this is the correct order to work
[38:04] because we love God his works are not
[38:07] Grievous to us
[38:09] because we love God the Commandments
[38:11] that he gives us the things he wants to
[38:12] do the the actions the life that he
[38:15] wants us to live and the actions he
[38:16] wants us to take they're not Grievous to
[38:18] us because we love him so it's not a
[38:21] burden to us it's not a restriction to
[38:23] us because it's it's a it's an act of
[38:26] love and an act of love doesn't become a
[38:28] burden or a restriction or a a heavy
[38:31] load it becomes a joy and it becomes a
[38:34] pleasure
[38:35] you know the the
[38:38] if you know with a husband and wife if
[38:42] the wife is only serving her husband
[38:45] and only doing things for her husband to
[38:48] get favor from her husband
[38:51] or to to uh
[38:55] to have something to brag about with all
[38:57] the other women
[38:59] are to look better or to do a better
[39:01] work or you know and you can always spot
[39:04] it from a mile away you know a woman
[39:06] says
[39:07] well the Bible says she Rises early in
[39:09] baked bread I bake two loaves of bread
[39:11] this morning
[39:15] praise God
[39:17] for who
[39:18] who did you bake them for
[39:21] so that you could tell somebody else
[39:22] when you got to church so you can brag
[39:24] about following the scripture you can
[39:25] show that you're a good believer who did
[39:28] you really bake the bread for
[39:31] is it that might be an extreme an
[39:34] example but you run into those examples
[39:37] all the time
[39:39] all the time that you can see the motive
[39:42] isn't right but but when when a woman is
[39:45] secure in the love of her husband she
[39:47] knows she doesn't have to earn his love
[39:48] she doesn't have an Earnest affection
[39:50] amen if if she's having a good day amen
[39:53] he loves her the same but she's having a
[39:55] bad day if she's sick and she's not able
[39:57] to even get out of bed she has the same
[39:58] level of love and the same level of
[40:00] affection that is not based on anything
[40:02] she does but she's secure in his love
[40:05] for her amen then for her to do for her
[40:07] husband is not a trudgery it's not a
[40:09] chore amen it's not a burden it's an act
[40:12] of love it's something she does and if
[40:13] it's anything else than that amen that
[40:15] marriage is under a strain and having
[40:17] problems because it should not be that
[40:19] way
[40:20] it should not be that it's so hard amen
[40:23] it should not be that it's such a
[40:25] drudgery amen for a wife to serve her
[40:27] husband it should be something that
[40:29] pleases her that she's so she's so
[40:31] secure in his love and she has such a
[40:33] desire to him that it's a natural
[40:35] outcropping of her love that she just
[40:37] wants to do something for him amen we
[40:40] see sometimes I get amazed at the things
[40:42] that my wife wants to do for me and I'm
[40:44] like no I can do that myself like I can
[40:45] do that you don't have to do that you're
[40:47] busy I'll do this and she says no no no
[40:49] I want to do it
[40:51] and when she would say something like
[40:52] that to me I'm like my goodness
[40:56] because she wanted to I was willing to
[40:59] do it she was busy I was going to do it
[41:01] in her place but she said no no I want
[41:03] to do it and I began to realize that's
[41:06] exactly what I want to do for God I want
[41:08] to do for him I just want to do
[41:09] something for him I just want to show
[41:11] him my love him I want an opportunity to
[41:13] say I love you amen whatever it is that
[41:16] I can do amen I'm not looking to get
[41:18] something back from him I'm not looking
[41:20] to please anybody else but oh if I just
[41:23] had an opportunity if I knew something
[41:25] would please him it's like David's
[41:27] Mighty Men amen they they loved David so
[41:29] much and they had so much confidence and
[41:31] love and affection for David when they
[41:33] heard David cry out one time oh that I
[41:36] could drink from The Well of the Waters
[41:38] of Bethlehem when they heard it the off
[41:40] they went cutting their way through the
[41:42] Philistines why they had love for David
[41:45] that wasn't a commandment from David
[41:46] that wasn't a chore that they had to
[41:49] fulfill to receive something from David
[41:51] they loved him so much that when David
[41:53] uttered that in a prayer to God they
[41:56] took off to go get him the water from
[41:58] Bethlehem
[42:00] that's how I want to serve God that's
[42:03] the way I want it to be between me and
[42:05] God I want to love him so much and
[42:07] respect him so much that when I see
[42:10] maybe he didn't say Chad you have to go
[42:12] do this but I see he likes that
[42:16] when I see in the prophet's life that he
[42:19] likes that and I see and I see it in the
[42:22] Bible that's what he likes amen I want
[42:24] to be attentive and say that's what he
[42:26] likes that's what I'll do
[42:28] not because he made me amen not because
[42:31] there's a commandment you shall on this
[42:34] day do this but if I can see that that's
[42:36] pleasing to the Lord that's an attitude
[42:38] he likes that's an approach that's
[42:40] pleasing to him I want to do it amen
[42:42] because I love him
[42:47] sometimes I've had so many discussions
[42:49] with people and that leave me scratching
[42:51] my head
[42:52] because sometimes there's an issue and
[42:54] you'll you'll bring the you'll bring the
[42:56] word on the issue
[42:58] and somebody will say was that a heaven
[43:01] or hell issue
[43:06] is that a commandment or is that a
[43:09] suggestion
[43:11] and sometimes I I've been rocked back on
[43:13] my heels because no it's not a
[43:16] commandment like there's no like fire
[43:19] and brims is not going to come out if
[43:21] you don't do this this isn't a
[43:22] commandment you're not going to be under
[43:23] church discipline but I'm showing you
[43:25] something the prophet said was pleasing
[43:27] to the Lord and I'm showing you
[43:28] something out of the scriptures and you
[43:30] say well is that a heaven or hell issue
[43:34] I'm like why are we serving God anyways
[43:37] when it comes down to it what's the
[43:40] whole point do we only want to know the
[43:42] heaven or hell issues
[43:45] I only want to know the things that I
[43:48] need to get to heaven but everything
[43:50] else that that is not a heaven or hell
[43:53] issue
[44:00] there's a problem with the motive
[44:02] behind that kind of service
[44:07] everything
[44:10] so if you love God
[44:13] his Commandments are not Grievous
[44:16] and I would say even Beyond his
[44:18] Commandments
[44:19] if something pleases him then it would
[44:22] please us to do what pleases him
[44:24] because we love him this isn't a have to
[44:27] this is why religion will fail
[44:29] because religion will always come back
[44:31] to the heaven or hell thing
[44:33] and then we're going to have to you know
[44:35] line up our rules and get the
[44:36] Commandments right and find out what is
[44:38] exactly a heaven or hell issue and what
[44:41] what then we're going to have to rate
[44:43] sins we have these sins that are Heaven
[44:45] and Hell and these sins and then becomes
[44:47] a whole form of religion and now we
[44:49] begin to follow a religious order for
[44:52] acceptance because you know I want to go
[44:55] to heaven okay if I do all this I'll go
[44:57] to heaven now if I do this it's not a
[44:59] heaven or hell issue but I could lose a
[45:01] little bit of my reward in heaven and
[45:03] I'm willing to part with a little bit of
[45:04] reward for a little bit of fun in this
[45:06] life so these are a reward issue these
[45:08] are a heaven and hell is you I'll do all
[45:10] of these and I'll see about these
[45:16] now when you present that to everybody
[45:18] nobody's like no no that's horrible but
[45:21] but you know what we're human beings
[45:25] and where every one of us is susceptible
[45:28] to this kind amen when hybridization was
[45:31] the most horrible thing that ever
[45:33] happened to you and I
[45:36] it injected a whole other a whole other
[45:40] set of feelings emotions ideas a
[45:44] corruption that set in and began to
[45:46] pervert Humanity amen and we're all in
[45:49] human bodies and we have to fight all of
[45:52] these selfish self-centered tendencies
[45:54] that come from Pride
[45:57] and we have to be aware of it and fight
[45:59] that and say and it's good to ask
[46:02] ourselves questions why am I doing this
[46:05] why am I doing this why am I doing that
[46:08] why what's the motive behind it and just
[46:10] get down and say God show me Lord show
[46:13] me what if there's any wicked way in me
[46:16] show me what my motive is what my
[46:18] objective is me you know I've prayed so
[46:21] many times God make my heart pure amen
[46:25] thank you
[46:27] praise God
[46:29] I don't think maturity is getting to the
[46:32] place where you can take the World by
[46:33] storm and you know everything I think
[46:34] maturity is when you realize that you
[46:36] can't do anything
[46:38] and that you're a failure to begin with
[46:39] and everything you've tried to do has
[46:41] failed and all of your efforts have
[46:43] fallen short I think real maturity is
[46:45] when we get to the place where you say I
[46:47] am a hopeless creature without the
[46:49] spirit of God
[46:51] I am an absolute failure and an
[46:54] impossibility for me to get right
[46:55] without the spirit of God
[46:58] brother Benham says in God's only
[47:00] provided place of worship he said that
[47:02] every little jot everything you must be
[47:04] faithful in
[47:06] always the little the little foxes that
[47:08] spoils the vine sometimes it's not the
[47:10] big things you do it's the little things
[47:12] that you leave undone remember a chain
[47:15] is only strongest at its weakest link
[47:16] blessed are they that do all the
[47:18] Commandments of God that they might have
[47:20] a right to enter in do all God said and
[47:23] it said for women to have long hair you
[47:25] say a man told me not long ago I Don't
[47:27] Preach a clothesline religion I said
[47:29] then you're not preaching the gospel
[47:31] God laid it out there he said what to do
[47:34] and you either do it that's your natural
[47:36] reasonable thing that little thing that
[47:39] little insignificant Jesus said blessed
[47:41] are they that would take all the little
[47:42] things do the little things and a woman
[47:45] let her hair grow grow that's just why
[47:48] it's just something she can do and she
[47:50] won't even do that she won't even do
[47:52] that oh teach us the great things he's
[47:54] quoting them teach us the great things
[47:56] he said how can you teach the great
[47:59] things when you won't do the simple
[48:00] common things because you see your
[48:03] motive and your objective is wrong
[48:08] brother man could take the statements
[48:10] they were making and and he rephrases
[48:13] his different ways they would say uh uh
[48:15] uh brother Brandon with a gift like
[48:17] yours why are you on these harping on
[48:19] the women about their dress and harping
[48:21] about their hair with a gift like yours
[48:22] you should be teaching them how to
[48:24] receive gifts
[48:25] and how to prophesy and he says if they
[48:28] won't learn their ABCs how are they
[48:30] going to learn algebra so he rephrases
[48:31] this many other ways but right here when
[48:33] he gets down to the statement when they
[48:35] would say teach us great things he says
[48:38] your motive and your objective is wrong
[48:41] you want to learn great things but
[48:44] you're stepping on top of all the little
[48:46] things the reach for the great things
[48:47] showing that your motive something is
[48:50] self something is self-centered in the
[48:52] motive you want to you want to reach a
[48:54] certain level of revelation you want a
[48:56] certain level of understanding you want
[48:57] to get to the big things you want to get
[48:59] to the gifts of the Spirit and the
[49:00] operation of the gifts but you're
[49:02] trampling all over the things that God
[49:04] has asked us to do the simple reasonable
[49:07] things that we can do and you'll step
[49:09] right on that to try to reach for a
[49:12] great Revelation and it shows that the
[49:14] whole motive for wanting more is wrong
[49:18] the whole motive is wrong
[49:22] because we're willing to trample the
[49:25] word of God and the desire of God to get
[49:27] something more from God shows our motive
[49:30] is completely wrong there's something
[49:31] about self mixed in there somewhere
[49:36] brother man when he's he's asked about
[49:38] gifts
[49:39] and he says the greatest gift I know of
[49:41] is love
[49:43] if I could have everything I wanted all
[49:45] the gifts of any gift because I would
[49:47] choose love amen because for every gift
[49:49] to operate correctly it must operate by
[49:51] love
[49:54] so he says
[49:55] he goes on to say uh your motive your
[49:58] objective is wrong it's your love to God
[50:00] lord I don't care what you want me to do
[50:03] I'm willing to do it then you're getting
[50:05] somewhere but if you don't do it that
[50:07] way the way he said do it
[50:11] he goes on in the message perseverance
[50:12] says and the first thing your
[50:13] achievement is only by your motive and
[50:15] your objective so your achievement is
[50:17] only by your motive and your objective
[50:19] your motive has got to be right and your
[50:21] objective has got to be right if your
[50:23] objective is right and your motive is
[50:25] wrong then it won't happen
[50:27] you've got to have the right objective
[50:29] you've got to have the right motive and
[50:31] then take it upon the leading of the
[50:33] holy spirit in your heart and stay with
[50:35] it God will bring it to pass
[50:38] so when you look at motive and objective
[50:42] if you can say Let's Take It on the
[50:44] religious side
[50:47] our objective
[50:49] our objective is to keep the
[50:52] Commandments of God
[50:54] there's nothing wrong with that
[50:55] objective
[50:56] is that a good objective
[50:59] my motive is so that I'll get to heaven
[51:03] now you can see God's not going to bless
[51:05] that
[51:06] although the objective is correct and so
[51:09] so many times we get the correct
[51:11] objective when we don't judge the motive
[51:12] and we think that we're right and God is
[51:15] on our side because we got the right
[51:16] objective but we have the wrong motive
[51:20] right sometimes we have the right
[51:22] objective I'm going to go tell that
[51:24] brother that he's wrong by the word so
[51:26] that he can repent
[51:29] that's the right objective
[51:31] but if the motive is so I can show him
[51:34] so I can get back at him so I can prove
[51:37] I know more than him so that I can be
[51:39] the expert on the subject
[51:41] then it's the wrong motive
[51:46] so no matter how true the objective is
[51:49] if the motive is wrong it's still wrong
[51:53] does that make sense
[51:55] I you know your objective can be I'm
[51:57] going to teach my children amen what God
[52:00] requires and how to dress and how to act
[52:02] and and how to act in public how to
[52:04] carry themselves as Christians good
[52:06] objective
[52:07] but if the motive is so that they don't
[52:09] embarrass me and so we as a family look
[52:11] good in front of the other believers
[52:12] you've got the wrong motive and that
[52:15] thing won't be blessed by God
[52:18] we have to have the right objective and
[52:20] the right motive
[52:22] we got to do it for love
[52:25] I teach my children the ways of God
[52:27] because I love them and I love God
[52:30] any other motive will not come out right
[52:35] amen let's go to Matthew 19 together
[52:46] foreign
[52:53] Matthew chapter 19.
[53:00] and verse 16 19 and 16.
[53:05] and behold one came and said unto him
[53:07] good Master what good things shall I do
[53:09] then I may have eternal life and he said
[53:12] unto him why call us thou me good there
[53:14] is none good but one that is God but if
[53:16] thou will enter into life keep the
[53:18] Commandments and he say them to him
[53:20] which Jesus said Thou shalt do Thou
[53:24] shalt not Thou shalt do no murder Thou
[53:26] shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not
[53:28] steal Thou shalt not bear false witness
[53:30] honor thy father and thy mother and thou
[53:33] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[53:35] the young man said unto him all these
[53:37] things have I kept from my youth what
[53:40] lack I yet I just want you to remember
[53:43] he asked the question
[53:47] verse 21 Jesus said unto him if thou
[53:49] will be perfect go and sell that thou
[53:52] Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt
[53:55] Treasures in Heaven and come and follow
[53:57] me
[53:58] but when the young man heard that saying
[54:00] he went away sorrowful for he had great
[54:03] possessions
[54:05] his objective was fine
[54:08] his motive was wrong
[54:12] he wanted to inherit eternal life
[54:15] but Jesus said if you want to be perfect
[54:18] this is what you'll do
[54:20] and he was he come to the source he came
[54:23] to the one with all the information and
[54:24] he wanted to know he says I've done all
[54:27] this what like I yet and Jesus was
[54:30] showing him where he had a lack in his
[54:31] life amen but that that you know in
[54:34] order to come to Perfection and overcome
[54:36] that lack he was going to have to sell
[54:39] all of his great possessions and give to
[54:41] the poor and come follow Jesus and if
[54:44] his motive had been right for the
[54:46] question he would have sold all given to
[54:49] the poor and followed Jesus
[54:51] no matter how how righteous the
[54:54] objective is or how correct it is in the
[54:56] word amen the motive the motive was
[54:59] proved when he went away sorrowful for
[55:01] he had great possessions it showed his
[55:03] whole motive for asking the question was
[55:05] wrong to begin with he didn't have any
[55:08] desire to serve God to please God to do
[55:10] what God wanted he wanted God to reward
[55:13] him with an eternal inheritance
[55:16] he won an eternal life and I wonder how
[55:19] many people serve God so they can go to
[55:20] heaven
[55:23] instead of serving God because God's
[55:25] worthy to be served
[55:27] how many will obey God for reward
[55:30] instead of obeying God because we love
[55:32] him and he's worthy to be obeyed
[55:35] how many people will sacrifice for God
[55:38] Amen even in paying tithes and offering
[55:41] because there's a promise that he'll
[55:42] pour out a blessing and and that's the
[55:45] true word that's the absolute word but
[55:47] if our only motive and tithe and
[55:49] offering is because there's a reward
[55:51] that comes for that tithe and offering
[55:53] then our objective is right but our
[55:55] motive is wrong
[55:57] because I if God asked me to give him a
[56:01] tithe and an offering I want to give him
[56:02] a tithe and offering if I get nothing in
[56:05] return if that's what he wants I want my
[56:07] heart to give him that
[56:10] that's that's the right objective and
[56:12] the right motive coupled together and
[56:15] how can God not bless that amen
[56:18] praise God
[56:19] so this Rich Young Ruler
[56:24] he had the right idea but he had the
[56:27] wrong motive
[56:29] sometimes I wonder
[56:32] why we come to a message Church
[56:35] why do we believe the message
[56:38] is it because all my family believes the
[56:41] message in order to have a good
[56:42] fellowship with all my family I need to
[56:44] be a message believer
[56:47] wrong motive
[56:51] is it true that if you leave the message
[56:53] it'll affect your relationship
[56:54] absolutely
[56:56] there's no way it can't because you're
[56:58] not in harmony
[57:00] but it's the wrong motive
[57:03] for staying
[57:05] for believing anything
[57:08] for Harmony in a family for Harmony in
[57:10] the home it's the wrong motive
[57:13] I said God help us to get our objective
[57:16] right and get our motive right
[57:22] if we do it because
[57:24] well I know this is right and I want to
[57:26] be right
[57:27] well I mean every human being wants to
[57:29] be right and we know the message is
[57:31] right it's been Vindicated by God
[57:33] but it's just not about finding the
[57:35] right way so that I can be right so that
[57:37] I can tell everybody else that I'm right
[57:39] and so that I can have the satisfaction
[57:41] of being right
[57:42] and so then in every debate or every
[57:44] argument I'll come out right and and I'm
[57:47] right and I'm right and this is right
[57:48] and we're right and everybody's right
[57:50] and the bride is right and we're all
[57:51] right
[57:53] and we could still be all wrong
[57:58] if our motive is wrong
[58:00] I said
[58:01] I believe this message because God put
[58:04] it in my heart to believe it
[58:06] and I serve him this way because I love
[58:10] him and I want that to be my only motive
[58:14] ever and I can't say that it always has
[58:17] been there's been wrong motives there's
[58:19] been right objectives wrong motives all
[58:21] through my Christian wrong but I don't
[58:23] want it to be what I want I want it to
[58:24] come back to the Purity as I love him
[58:26] because he put something in me that can
[58:28] love him back I receive this word
[58:30] because he put something in me that can
[58:31] receive the word I love him and I love
[58:33] his word not because I'm a great person
[58:35] but because he sowed a seeded me before
[58:37] the foundation of the world that could
[58:39] love him and because it's there it makes
[58:41] me love him more amen it makes me more
[58:44] desires to do for him because of what
[58:46] he's done for me
[58:48] and I truly want that to be my only
[58:50] motive
[58:52] I say God still has some work to do on
[58:54] me
[58:56] and I I'm not going to point anybody but
[58:58] I think I'm not the only one
[59:01] God still needs to work on us and we
[59:04] still need to die to ourselves until we
[59:06] can take this wonderful objective that
[59:08] we have and match it with a true motive
[59:11] and come together and see God really
[59:13] move in our lives
[59:17] brother remember says in thy entire
[59:19] church age he said in those dark and
[59:21] Dreadful years the True Vine held its
[59:23] love for God and the love of the
[59:25] Brethren God commended them for it
[59:28] remember it wasn't they had this great
[59:31] works this great love this great service
[59:33] this Faith this patience they didn't
[59:36] have it in the atmosphere you and I have
[59:38] now they had in a totally different kind
[59:41] of atmosphere and that atmosphere would
[59:43] test that love all the time
[59:47] and I don't know what atmosphere will
[59:49] always be in
[59:50] but but God will find a way to test our
[59:55] motives
[59:57] even if he just needs to expose him to
[59:59] us
[1:00:02] even if God needs for us to see that
[1:00:06] we've got the wrong motive God will find
[1:00:08] circumstances he'll find a way to expose
[1:00:11] the motive because he needs for us to
[1:00:14] see because we need to repent because
[1:00:16] God is a gentleman he doesn't come in
[1:00:18] and rip things out of you you don't ask
[1:00:19] him to take away
[1:00:24] and so maybe
[1:00:26] God allows circumstances in our lives
[1:00:30] and and you know
[1:00:32] I think it's funny sometimes the
[1:00:34] circumstances in our lives and some of
[1:00:36] the reactions that I've had in the past
[1:00:38] you know I I get mad at the Devil and
[1:00:41] yell at him and
[1:00:43] call him by names
[1:00:45] try to hurt his feelings
[1:00:50] try to scare him with my volume
[1:00:55] trying to make him afraid of me because
[1:00:56] I'm yelling at him
[1:00:58] call him names so he knows I'm not
[1:01:00] afraid of him
[1:01:02] but if I wasn't afraid of him why was I
[1:01:04] yelling so much and calling him names
[1:01:08] and sometimes the circumstances are just
[1:01:11] the circumstances I've created
[1:01:14] and I'm yelling at the Devil but God's
[1:01:16] just a loud circumstances to unfold so
[1:01:19] that I could see that my motive was
[1:01:21] wrong or that my objective is wrong
[1:01:23] something in me was wrong and it was
[1:01:26] God's Great Mercy that allowed all that
[1:01:28] to happen and I'm so fixated on hating
[1:01:31] the devil that I don't realize I'm the
[1:01:33] problem
[1:01:34] that if I would if I would lay down my
[1:01:38] own life and make a full surrender if I
[1:01:40] would die more to my own self and my
[1:01:43] self-preservation and my self-love and
[1:01:45] my self-pride if I would die more than
[1:01:47] that then I wouldn't be in this problem
[1:01:50] to begin with this problem yes God
[1:01:52] allows the devil God gave him free reign
[1:01:54] yes there's something evil that happened
[1:01:56] but but God allowed it because I set up
[1:01:59] the conditions I set the stage by my own
[1:02:02] self-love my my own desire for
[1:02:04] self-preservation
[1:02:07] so God help me to die If thy attire was
[1:02:11] the cream of the crop how did they get
[1:02:12] to be the cream of the crop
[1:02:15] you don't just wake up and say cream of
[1:02:17] the crop
[1:02:21] no there was a lot of sacrifice
[1:02:25] there was a lot of surrender
[1:02:27] there was a whole lot an entire Tyrant
[1:02:30] they did not have the Revelation that's
[1:02:32] been given to us they'd even fully know
[1:02:34] who they were they didn't even have a
[1:02:36] realization of God's Great Plan of
[1:02:38] Redemption and they didn't even see
[1:02:39] where they fit into the Plan of
[1:02:41] Redemption but what about this day when
[1:02:43] God has opened up his mind to us and
[1:02:45] shared with us his Plan of Redemption
[1:02:47] who we are where we were before the
[1:02:49] foundational world and where we fit into
[1:02:51] the Plan of Redemption my goodness if it
[1:02:53] that doesn't encourage us just to
[1:02:55] surrender just to die already and give
[1:02:57] up because he's showed us what the plan
[1:02:59] is he showed us what's happening he
[1:03:01] showed us where we fit into the plan the
[1:03:04] thyatiran Believers were the cream of
[1:03:05] the crop and they didn't have any of
[1:03:07] that they had no idea where they were in
[1:03:09] the cycle of redemption to the church
[1:03:10] ages they had no idea the role they were
[1:03:13] playing they didn't know what part of
[1:03:15] the prophecy they were fulfilling but in
[1:03:17] this day we do amen and I say God
[1:03:20] motivate that to make that motivate me
[1:03:23] to a greater love amen a greater
[1:03:25] humility a greater desire to surrender
[1:03:29] amen
[1:03:32] you just go back to Revelation chapter
[1:03:35] two keep reading there
[1:03:44] Revelation chapter 2.
[1:03:48] I'm going to read this verse again verse
[1:03:50] 19 out of the thyroid Church age
[1:03:52] Revelation 2 and 19.
[1:03:55] it says I Know Thy works and charity
[1:03:59] that word's love thy Works charity is
[1:04:01] love and service and faith and patience
[1:04:05] in thy works and thy last to be more
[1:04:07] than the first
[1:04:09] mother Brown is going to refer to that
[1:04:11] again and he's breaking it down in
[1:04:12] sections and he says now he says and I
[1:04:14] know your faith he said now he does not
[1:04:17] say here excuse me as he did to the
[1:04:20] church in pergamon pergamos you hold my
[1:04:23] faith he is not talking about his faith
[1:04:26] now but he is commending them for their
[1:04:29] faithfulness
[1:04:30] now when he says I know your faith
[1:04:32] before in pergamon he says you've held
[1:04:35] my faith I mean that was the Faith of
[1:04:36] Christ but now he's not saying my faith
[1:04:38] now he's committing them on their faith
[1:04:40] and what brother Bram says is he's
[1:04:42] commending them for their faithfulness
[1:04:44] and as he does he also mentions their
[1:04:47] patience now faithfulness and patience
[1:04:50] go together in fact patience is the
[1:04:52] outcome of faithfulness verse says in
[1:04:55] James 1 3 the trying of your faith
[1:04:57] worketh patience there is absolutely no
[1:05:00] other way in which to gain patience it
[1:05:01] has to come by the trial of your faith
[1:05:04] Romans 5 3 tribulation worketh patience
[1:05:08] how highly God regards this outwork of
[1:05:11] our patients is seen in James 1 4 but
[1:05:14] let patience have her perfect work that
[1:05:17] you may be perfect an entire lacking
[1:05:19] nothing God God's will for us is
[1:05:23] perfection and that Perfection is
[1:05:25] patience
[1:05:26] waiting on God and waiting for God
[1:05:31] how do we get to where we're waiting on
[1:05:32] God and for God many times it comes in
[1:05:35] the form of Trials
[1:05:36] tribulations persecutions distress amen
[1:05:40] stresses that's when we're waiting on
[1:05:42] God and waiting for God Amen and what he
[1:05:46] told the thyatarians is I know your
[1:05:48] faith I know your faithfulness and your
[1:05:51] patience I know how under persecution
[1:05:53] you're waiting for me amen you're
[1:05:55] waiting on me and you're waiting for me
[1:05:57] I mean they weren't running around
[1:05:58] trying to make political alliances to
[1:06:00] make their problems go away they weren't
[1:06:02] trying to fix anything there was nothing
[1:06:03] they could do to fix it they were
[1:06:05] patiently staying faithful waiting on
[1:06:08] God because he was their only hope amen
[1:06:11] and he says God's will for us is
[1:06:14] perfection reading this again and that
[1:06:17] Perfection is patience waiting on God
[1:06:21] and waiting for God and you say why am I
[1:06:24] going through so much trouble because
[1:06:26] his will for us is perfection and that
[1:06:28] Perfection is patience
[1:06:30] why is it one trouble after another
[1:06:33] trouble one child one trial is not done
[1:06:35] and the other one's Sweeping in it's
[1:06:38] because his will for us is perfection
[1:06:40] and that Perfection comes in patience
[1:06:42] and patience is waiting on God and for
[1:06:46] God
[1:06:48] this is the process of character
[1:06:50] development he says how highly God has
[1:06:53] commended these Saints of the Dark Ages
[1:06:55] patient as Lambs led to the slaughter
[1:06:57] lovingly Faithfully they serve God that
[1:07:01] is all they wanted out of life just
[1:07:03] serving service to their lord how great
[1:07:06] how great was to be their reward
[1:07:10] let's go to Revelation 19. I want to
[1:07:13] look at another set of believers
[1:07:15] I want to look at the end time believers
[1:07:19] revelation 19.
[1:07:24] verse 11.
[1:07:27] Revelation 19 and 11 and I saw heaven
[1:07:29] open
[1:07:30] and behold a white horse and he that sat
[1:07:33] upon him was called faithful and true
[1:07:34] and in righteousness he does judge and
[1:07:37] make war his eyes were as a flame of
[1:07:39] fire and on his head were many crowns
[1:07:41] and he had a name written that no man
[1:07:43] knew but he himself and he was clothed
[1:07:45] with the vesture dipped in Blood and his
[1:07:47] name is called the word of God brother
[1:07:49] Branham said when Jesus comes this time
[1:07:51] he'll be called the word of God
[1:07:53] and the white horses he's riding is the
[1:07:56] word
[1:07:57] amen so we're talking about Christ in
[1:07:59] the end time
[1:08:00] verse 14 in the armies which were in
[1:08:03] heaven followed him upon white horses
[1:08:05] clothed in fine linen white and clean
[1:08:08] and out of his mouth go with a sharp
[1:08:10] sword that with it he should Smite the
[1:08:12] Nations that sword is his word
[1:08:16] and with it he should Smite the Nations
[1:08:18] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[1:08:20] iron and he treadth The Wine Press of
[1:08:22] the fierceness and the wrath of almighty
[1:08:24] God and he hath on his Vester and on his
[1:08:27] thigh a name written king of kings and
[1:08:29] Lord of lords and when this king of
[1:08:31] kings and Lord of Lord comes you'll be
[1:08:33] riding on a white horse the word
[1:08:35] his name will be called the word of God
[1:08:37] out of his mouth will come a sword which
[1:08:40] is the word of God it's the coming of
[1:08:42] the word the coming of the Lord amen and
[1:08:44] with him are the armies of Heaven let's
[1:08:47] turn back to revelation 17.
[1:08:54] Revelation 17-13 these have one mind and
[1:08:57] shall give their power and strength unto
[1:08:59] the Beast talking about the Ten Kings
[1:09:01] these shall make war with the lamb and
[1:09:04] the lamb shall overcome them for he is
[1:09:06] Lord of lords and king of kings and they
[1:09:09] that are with him are called and chosen
[1:09:12] and faithful
[1:09:15] God commended the thytime Believers
[1:09:17] because he knew their faith and he knew
[1:09:19] their patience and now brother Branham
[1:09:21] is referring to the scripture that we
[1:09:23] read and and he's in the seals he's in
[1:09:26] the fourth seal and he says he's got
[1:09:28] wrote Life riding on a white horse he's
[1:09:30] taking that from Revelation 19. brother
[1:09:32] Branham is going to connect Revelation
[1:09:34] 19 in the scripture in Revelation 17.
[1:09:36] he's going to put them together and he's
[1:09:38] got life riding on a white horse and
[1:09:40] there's a man with three different
[1:09:41] powers mixed up Called Death Gathering
[1:09:44] his Earthbound delegates and Christ is
[1:09:46] gathering as heaven-born subjects Saints
[1:09:49] are you a heaven-born subject
[1:09:51] then he's Gathering you
[1:09:54] he's got death thrown on him Christ's
[1:09:55] got Life Run on him those with him are
[1:09:58] on white horses also and they are called
[1:10:00] The Chosen before the foundation of the
[1:10:02] world and they are faithful to the word
[1:10:05] and woo I like that one called
[1:10:08] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:10:10] world and then faithful to the word by
[1:10:13] their choosing
[1:10:16] all stimulated with new wine and oil
[1:10:18] just riding Right Along coming down to
[1:10:20] meet him they know the Thunders will
[1:10:22] issue the thing course pretty soon
[1:10:24] here we find the end time Believers the
[1:10:26] followers of the word the the followers
[1:10:29] of Christ the word the one who's on the
[1:10:31] White Horse the one who is the his name
[1:10:34] is called the word of God Kings of kings
[1:10:36] and Lord of lords with the sharp sword
[1:10:38] that goeth out of his mouth following
[1:10:40] after him are his heaven-born subjects
[1:10:42] the followers of the word and they are
[1:10:45] chosen amen they are called they are
[1:10:47] chosen before the foundation world
[1:10:48] called amen by the message at the end
[1:10:51] time but then he says but faithful of
[1:10:54] their own choosing
[1:10:56] this is what he looked at the Believers
[1:10:58] in thyatira he's saying now you held my
[1:11:00] faith but I know your faith amen your
[1:11:02] faithfulness and your patience Amen to
[1:11:05] stay faithful to me in the midst of
[1:11:07] every obstacle in all darkness and all
[1:11:09] persecution I know your faith I know thy
[1:11:12] faith and thy patience and here we see
[1:11:14] the end time believers they are called
[1:11:16] they are chosen but they are faithful by
[1:11:20] their own choosing
[1:11:23] God has a law and that law of God is
[1:11:25] free choice
[1:11:27] he put us in that law free moral agency
[1:11:30] free choice he says we're given freedom
[1:11:32] to make our choice and I want to be one
[1:11:34] of those that are found faithful by my
[1:11:36] own choosing amen I don't want to take
[1:11:38] the law that he's given the opportunity
[1:11:41] he's given us to make our own choice to
[1:11:43] use it to choose to serve myself but I
[1:11:45] want to make that choice to serve him
[1:11:48] and God doesn't want a bride that has no
[1:11:51] option he wants a bride that has an
[1:11:54] option and in the option she chooses him
[1:11:56] amen
[1:11:58] he wants a bride amen coming up under
[1:12:01] free moral agency not where she has no
[1:12:03] choice but she's forced into a certain
[1:12:05] action she's forced into a certain
[1:12:07] service amen you don't want a wife like
[1:12:09] that I don't want a wife like that
[1:12:11] nobody wants a wife like that he wants a
[1:12:13] wife amen that has a choice she can make
[1:12:16] her choice she can serve herself or she
[1:12:18] can serve him but she chooses to serve
[1:12:21] him and that pleases him
[1:12:24] it's like what can I do to please him
[1:12:26] he's God of all Heaven and Earth and you
[1:12:28] know God gets angry God gets upset God
[1:12:31] gets offended and God is pleased
[1:12:34] read the Bible
[1:12:36] God is pleased
[1:12:39] God becomes Angry God gets offended
[1:12:42] amen so our actions can please God can
[1:12:46] offend God can make God angry can bring
[1:12:48] him pleasure and I say I want to use the
[1:12:52] law free moral agency and the love that
[1:12:54] he's placed in my heart and I want to
[1:12:56] choose his word over everything else in
[1:12:59] my life amen though it slay me I want to
[1:13:01] please him I want to buy my own choice
[1:13:04] amen there's so many times I've prayed
[1:13:06] in the past God if you would just make
[1:13:09] me
[1:13:11] how many get frustrated with yourself
[1:13:15] say God if you would just make me just
[1:13:17] make change me make me amen just make me
[1:13:21] only say positive things make me
[1:13:23] make me only make good choices make me
[1:13:26] only think pure thoughts amen but God is
[1:13:28] not taking away the law of free moral
[1:13:30] agency amen he's not taking away
[1:13:32] completely the effect of the curse and
[1:13:34] hybridization but we're here in it we're
[1:13:37] here in Satan's Eden and what can please
[1:13:39] God is in the midst of all the choices
[1:13:41] with free more latency when I choose to
[1:13:44] deny myself and take him and please him
[1:13:46] and not please me that pleases God
[1:13:50] he accepted able sacrifice because Abel
[1:13:53] waited to find out what God wanted he
[1:13:55] rejected Cain because Cain never waited
[1:13:58] he just brought what he wanted
[1:14:00] I said God let me lay in this word and
[1:14:03] see what you want and help me to make my
[1:14:06] choice for the right objective for the
[1:14:08] right motive and just do something to
[1:14:10] please you if I get nothing in return
[1:14:16] that was the attitude of the prophet of
[1:14:17] God
[1:14:19] the prophet of God told us that if after
[1:14:22] all this life I serve him and he sends
[1:14:25] me to hell if I go with the same spirit
[1:14:27] I have now I'll love him just the same
[1:14:33] let's go to Galatians chapter 5.
[1:14:48] Galatians chapter 5.
[1:14:58] Galatians 5 and 6.
[1:15:04] for Jesus Christ neither circumcision
[1:15:06] availeth anything nor uncircumcision but
[1:15:10] Faith which worketh by love
[1:15:13] so what works faith is love
[1:15:17] brother Ben's going to explain that here
[1:15:19] in a minute
[1:15:21] but but first there's a quote here out
[1:15:23] of the Prophet Elijah from 54 he says
[1:15:25] when you find unbelief it's accompanied
[1:15:27] by hatred
[1:15:28] if you find Faith it's accompanied by
[1:15:30] Love For Love creates faith
[1:15:33] love creates Faith love brings
[1:15:35] faithfulness
[1:15:37] he says here in perfect faith and Faith
[1:15:40] In Love is a is relation because you
[1:15:43] can't have faith unless you got love
[1:15:45] because your faith is in a God who is in
[1:15:47] the very essence of love
[1:15:49] faith and love works together
[1:15:52] here just like a young couple you take a
[1:15:54] young man and a young woman and they
[1:15:56] love they fall in love with one another
[1:15:57] and as they go along and begin to know
[1:15:59] one another more their hearts just begin
[1:16:01] to beat as one they're yet they're not
[1:16:04] husband and wife but their love binds
[1:16:06] them together and they have confidence
[1:16:08] in one another now if they really love
[1:16:10] one another really love and you know
[1:16:12] that this girl loves you and she knows
[1:16:15] that you love her You've Got Confidence
[1:16:16] faith in one another and if you've got
[1:16:19] faith in one another if you didn't you'd
[1:16:21] better not marry her see notice you got
[1:16:23] to have faith and you separate them and
[1:16:26] put them one extreme South and one
[1:16:27] extreme North there's still that love
[1:16:29] that beats for one another no matter
[1:16:31] where they're at they're just as true to
[1:16:33] one another as they can be because they
[1:16:36] love one another and if you love the
[1:16:38] Lord just not trying to dodge hell but
[1:16:40] you love the Lord then you have faith in
[1:16:42] God see if you love him
[1:16:44] how do I have faith how can I be found
[1:16:46] faithful I have to love him first how
[1:16:49] can I love him because he first loved me
[1:16:51] amen amen it makes me love him back my
[1:16:54] love is a reciprocal love and I love him
[1:16:56] with all my heart and it creates a
[1:16:58] faithfulness in me and I judge him
[1:17:00] faithful and I want to be faithful back
[1:17:02] to him because I love him
[1:17:05] it goes so far beyond will I go to
[1:17:07] heaven or go to hell now it's got to go
[1:17:11] beyond that because in a marriage it's
[1:17:13] got to go beyond will he put me away in
[1:17:16] divorcement or will he keep me
[1:17:19] what kind of love what kind of marriage
[1:17:21] is that if a man says honey could you
[1:17:23] iron my shirt she says well will you
[1:17:25] divorce me if I don't
[1:17:28] well if you're not divorced man I won't
[1:17:30] do it
[1:17:31] well you say well ah you know the
[1:17:34] grocery budget I give you if you start
[1:17:36] ironing my shirts I'll increase it by 40
[1:17:37] bucks a week okay I'll iron your shirt
[1:17:42] what kind of relationship is that that's
[1:17:44] not what any of us want do you think God
[1:17:46] wants that if we don't want it do you
[1:17:48] think God wants that
[1:17:50] you think God wants the relationship
[1:17:52] where aim listen You'll Never there's
[1:17:54] things that go on in your mind that will
[1:17:56] never come out loud
[1:17:58] there's Wars that rage inside of you
[1:18:01] when you're faced with difficult
[1:18:02] decisions where you really get the
[1:18:04] rubber meets the road and you're really
[1:18:06] going to have to lay down your pride and
[1:18:08] sacrifice you're gonna have to be honest
[1:18:09] amen you're gonna have to expose
[1:18:11] yourself or or take the word of God in a
[1:18:13] way that that makes you contrary to
[1:18:15] everybody around you and when you do
[1:18:16] that thing there's Wars that go on
[1:18:18] inside of you it's like well I mean if
[1:18:20] you didn't God would love you anyways
[1:18:24] he would never cast you to hell because
[1:18:25] God can no more be lost you can no more
[1:18:27] be lost and God can be lost you heard
[1:18:29] names on the Lamb's Book of Life I mean
[1:18:31] and then these little Wars these little
[1:18:33] demon voices start going off in your
[1:18:35] head amen then God will love you anyways
[1:18:36] you don't have to do this nobody in the
[1:18:38] church will know who cares if nobody in
[1:18:41] the church will know
[1:18:44] I mean if that thought comes in your
[1:18:46] mind amen you can recognize there's a
[1:18:48] devil right there amen whispering in my
[1:18:50] ear I don't care if anybody in the
[1:18:52] church knows or doesn't know or will
[1:18:54] ever know amen I want my motive to be
[1:18:56] that I cannot stand to displease a God
[1:18:59] who has loved me this much I cannot
[1:19:01] stand to offend him to hurt him to cause
[1:19:04] him any displeasure when all that he has
[1:19:06] done for me I don't care if nobody ever
[1:19:08] knows that I did this I don't care if
[1:19:10] anybody ever knows that I make it right
[1:19:11] or don't make it right or whatever the
[1:19:13] circumstance is God will know if nobody
[1:19:16] else knows and that's enough for me
[1:19:18] [Music]
[1:19:20] yes
[1:19:22] yes how many things are done
[1:19:25] because we don't want the other people
[1:19:27] to think
[1:19:29] what will the church say what what will
[1:19:32] this family think
[1:19:34] and God sits there unconsidered
[1:19:37] and the wrestling of our minds
[1:19:41] well I might lose my job and I might
[1:19:44] this and that and God goes unconsidered
[1:19:48] in all the Warfare in my mind
[1:19:51] instead of my first consideration it
[1:19:53] would be him I'll lose my job that's
[1:19:56] fine but I don't want to displease God
[1:19:59] I may lose a relationship I may lose a
[1:20:01] friend but I don't want to lose my
[1:20:03] friend and God
[1:20:05] it's the one that matters the most to me
[1:20:07] above everything else friends whether no
[1:20:12] matter what we think amen this is the
[1:20:14] place this bride has to come to this is
[1:20:16] not optional in the end time she's got
[1:20:18] to come to this place where he is
[1:20:20] considered above everything else
[1:20:23] where he comes first where we choose of
[1:20:26] our own free choice to serve him first
[1:20:28] above everything else
[1:20:38] back in the thytime church age he
[1:20:40] finishes the scripture he says I Know
[1:20:42] Thy works and the last to be more than
[1:20:44] the first this is the second time he
[1:20:46] mentions The Works he started off with
[1:20:48] works then he went to love and service
[1:20:51] and faith and patience then he comes
[1:20:53] back to Works in thy works and the last
[1:20:55] of me more than the first
[1:20:57] prophet of God says this is certainly
[1:20:58] remarkable as the darkness of the age
[1:21:00] increased as the honor roll of the
[1:21:03] martyrs grew lengthier day by day they
[1:21:05] worked all the harder
[1:21:07] they served all the more and their faith
[1:21:09] increased how tragic it was that in the
[1:21:12] Ephesian age love waned
[1:21:14] and truly nothing is said of the
[1:21:16] increased labor of love in other ages
[1:21:18] think of this the Ephesians age they
[1:21:20] lost their first love
[1:21:22] they they stopped being so concerned
[1:21:25] about what God thought and they started
[1:21:27] becoming concerned about what the group
[1:21:28] thought and their love began to wane in
[1:21:32] the Ephesian Church age and then he says
[1:21:34] no and truly nothing is said of the
[1:21:38] increased labor of love in any other age
[1:21:42] so no other age was talked about and I
[1:21:44] Know Thy works and the last to be more
[1:21:46] than the first meaning you're doing more
[1:21:48] than you started off doing
[1:21:50] is there any other age where he said
[1:21:52] that no every age was diminishing
[1:21:55] as the Revival fires found begin to fade
[1:21:58] away but this one he says and I Know Thy
[1:22:00] works and thy last to be more than the
[1:22:01] first there was an increase of Labor of
[1:22:04] Love in the thyatiron age but he says
[1:22:07] but in this age in the darkest of all
[1:22:11] ages they served him even more
[1:22:14] what a lesson that is there is no
[1:22:16] ceasing of this gracious service of Love
[1:22:18] unto the Lord but rather an increasing
[1:22:21] of him that is the secret let the enemy
[1:22:23] attempt to thwart our service to the
[1:22:25] Lord our reply is increased service when
[1:22:28] the faint are crying in fear that is the
[1:22:30] time to shout the victory
[1:22:32] when it's getting worse that's a greater
[1:22:35] opportunity to serve him
[1:22:37] when the persecution comes on more it's
[1:22:40] a greater opportunity to show God you
[1:22:42] love him
[1:22:43] to serve him the more
[1:22:47] brother Graham says in the message
[1:22:48] Christ is revealed in his own word he
[1:22:52] says I've been this week down in the
[1:22:53] country staying with some very dear
[1:22:55] friends
[1:22:56] I asked some of them at the table
[1:22:57] yesterday when we was eating we always
[1:23:00] sit around and like a little study on
[1:23:02] the Bible we was talking about love and
[1:23:05] there was a certain person said to me he
[1:23:06] said I believe you're an antichrist so
[1:23:09] brother M's referring to somebody had
[1:23:11] told called him an antichrist and here's
[1:23:14] his response I said if that would be
[1:23:16] pleasing to my Lord that's what I want
[1:23:19] to be
[1:23:22] I have some growing to do
[1:23:25] in the Lord
[1:23:27] because I want to live this way
[1:23:30] this is what I want out of my life I
[1:23:33] want what God desires to be my greatest
[1:23:36] desire that's what I want God showed it
[1:23:40] to us in the life of a prophet he
[1:23:42] displayed it before us showing that all
[1:23:44] the potential that brought this to
[1:23:46] maturity is here the full word is here
[1:23:49] to bring all of us to this kind of
[1:23:51] maturity but this is where I want to be
[1:23:53] friends
[1:23:57] I said if that would be pleasing to my
[1:23:59] Lord that's what I want to be
[1:24:01] I want to be whatever he wants me to be
[1:24:03] I love him and if he should cast me into
[1:24:06] hell I still will love him if I go with
[1:24:09] the same spirit I have now
[1:24:11] he looked at me kind of strange I
[1:24:13] imagine he would if he called you an
[1:24:14] antichrist and that was the response
[1:24:18] but see when you get to this place
[1:24:20] people can't hurt you
[1:24:23] when you get to this place
[1:24:25] and somebody looks at you and says
[1:24:28] you're this and you're that and you're
[1:24:30] this and that and you can say I never
[1:24:33] was much to begin with
[1:24:34] I'm only what he makes me
[1:24:37] and whatever he wants me to be is what I
[1:24:39] want to be
[1:24:43] praise God
[1:24:45] then he says I've seen four or five of
[1:24:47] them there young men young wives fine
[1:24:49] women I note how them boys loved their
[1:24:51] wives so I said to them I said here is
[1:24:53] the way to test it he's talking about
[1:24:55] the right kind of love for God here's
[1:24:58] the way to test it if your wife excuse
[1:25:00] me before you were married now you go
[1:25:02] back and say this married life you
[1:25:04] you've been dreaming you were married
[1:25:06] you really wasn't married but you
[1:25:08] dreamed you were and you woke up and you
[1:25:11] went and talked it over with your
[1:25:12] girlfriend and said you know I dreamed
[1:25:14] that we were married and we had children
[1:25:15] and we living happy
[1:25:17] and we living happy and waiting for the
[1:25:20] coming of the Lord and everything and
[1:25:22] then this girl would say to you you know
[1:25:23] I love another man better than I love
[1:25:25] you I could be happier with the other
[1:25:28] man
[1:25:29] could you from your heart love her well
[1:25:31] enough to say God's blessings rest upon
[1:25:34] you my dear go with this other man
[1:25:37] now now check that each of you men you
[1:25:40] you women what if your love is correct
[1:25:43] you would do that for you are interested
[1:25:45] in her welfare
[1:25:47] you know what the incorrect kind of love
[1:25:49] would do
[1:25:50] hate the guy she likes
[1:25:53] get angry with her for not loving you
[1:25:56] for wanting to prefer this other man and
[1:25:59] trying some scheming way to get him out
[1:26:01] of the picture so you can have her
[1:26:04] that's the wrong kind of love
[1:26:06] but that's the love that motivates most
[1:26:08] humans
[1:26:10] and they call that love
[1:26:13] and it is a form of love but it's the
[1:26:15] wrong kind of love because God's love
[1:26:18] always always is self-sacrificing look
[1:26:21] at God God is self-sacrificing his love
[1:26:23] he gives of himself for the ones that he
[1:26:26] loves amen and that would be the wrong
[1:26:27] kind of love the right kind of love
[1:26:29] would be to say if you would be happier
[1:26:31] with that other man and that's what you
[1:26:33] want I love you so much then I would
[1:26:35] want you to go be with that other man
[1:26:37] though it would kill me amen you see
[1:26:39] that kind of statement's not saying I'll
[1:26:41] be fine that's okay with me it doesn't
[1:26:44] have to be okay with you it can kill you
[1:26:46] it could rip your heart out you can cry
[1:26:48] a whole month over it amen but the right
[1:26:51] kind of love is willing to suffer that
[1:26:53] kind of pain to let somebody else amen
[1:26:56] go with what would make them happier
[1:26:59] that's the right kind of love
[1:27:03] so even this is how brother man begins
[1:27:05] to explain that
[1:27:09] so he says well if your love is correct
[1:27:11] you would do that for you are interested
[1:27:13] in her welfare but you know you know you
[1:27:16] could have her you can live with her
[1:27:18] she's your wife she would be she'd marry
[1:27:20] you but she won't be happy she'd be
[1:27:22] happier and then if you love her then
[1:27:24] you want her to be happy therefore
[1:27:26] whatever the will of God is let's God's
[1:27:29] will be done whether I'm happy with it
[1:27:31] or not
[1:27:33] I want to live so he will be pleased
[1:27:35] pleased with me with what I do therefore
[1:27:38] check your objective and your motive by
[1:27:40] that you know whether you love God or
[1:27:42] not what if he'd say you serve me if I'm
[1:27:44] going to cast you cast you away I love
[1:27:47] you anyhow
[1:27:50] if you're going to cast you away I love
[1:27:51] you anyhow amen and brother Benham said
[1:27:54] that's the right kind of love that's the
[1:27:57] kind of love that we should emulate amen
[1:27:59] there was a a whole religious order in
[1:28:02] the day in Jerusalem the day Jesus
[1:28:04] showed up to begin his ministry and that
[1:28:06] whole religious order claimed that they
[1:28:08] were lovers of God and lovers of his
[1:28:10] word and here was God standing in flesh
[1:28:13] the Fulfillment of the word and Jesus
[1:28:15] says if you love God you would love me
[1:28:17] for I came out from God
[1:28:20] but what they loved was Prestige what
[1:28:22] they loved was position what they loved
[1:28:24] was the long flowing robes and the long
[1:28:26] prayers on the corner and people
[1:28:28] treating them with respect and honor
[1:28:30] they loved their position with the with
[1:28:32] the the situation that they had with
[1:28:34] Rome amen when Jesus began to work out
[1:28:37] Miracles amen they had a private Council
[1:28:39] and how they would destroy him because
[1:28:41] he says if this continues Rome will come
[1:28:43] and will lose our place and our nation
[1:28:48] they weren't even interested that people
[1:28:50] were being healed and blind eyes were
[1:28:52] being opened and the sign of the Messiah
[1:28:54] was being performed what they were doing
[1:28:55] was guarding their position
[1:28:58] and their Nation
[1:29:00] showing that the one that they really
[1:29:02] loved was themselves not God
[1:29:05] and Jesus called this out in the Book of
[1:29:07] John if you loved God you would love me
[1:29:09] also
[1:29:11] how can you say you love God and you
[1:29:13] seek to kill me a man that has told you
[1:29:16] the truth
[1:29:18] you see if they really had the right
[1:29:21] kind of love for God
[1:29:22] they would have lost their Nation to
[1:29:25] have God
[1:29:26] lost their position to have God lost
[1:29:29] everything just to have him
[1:29:33] that's the way I want to live
[1:29:36] when it comes to to showing
[1:29:39] our works our works are based off of
[1:29:42] faith and our faith is based off of love
[1:29:46] let's go to First Corinthians chapter
[1:29:48] 13.
[1:30:00] it's a very familiar scripture
[1:30:02] but I love the characteristics and
[1:30:04] attitude and the approach of the right
[1:30:06] kind of love
[1:30:09] First Corinthians 13 and 1.
[1:30:15] though I speak with the tongues of men
[1:30:17] and of angels and have not charity I
[1:30:20] become a sounding brass or tinkling
[1:30:22] symbol
[1:30:23] and though I have the gift of Prophecy
[1:30:25] and understand all Mysteries and all
[1:30:26] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[1:30:28] that I could remove mountains and have
[1:30:30] not charity I am nothing
[1:30:35] let that soak in
[1:30:37] let it really soak in
[1:30:41] if I could move mountains if I could
[1:30:43] give prophecy if I could sell them if I
[1:30:45] had great sounds and speak in tongues if
[1:30:47] I could do every Mighty gift that could
[1:30:49] be done but I don't have love I am
[1:30:53] nothing
[1:30:55] the end of the day it doesn't matter
[1:31:01] verse 3 and though I bestow all my goods
[1:31:03] to feed the poor and though I give my
[1:31:05] body to be burned and have not charity
[1:31:07] it profiteth me nothing all my works all
[1:31:12] my services all my Deeds all my gifts
[1:31:15] without love profit with me nothing
[1:31:18] leaves me as nothing
[1:31:22] verse 4 charity love suffereth long and
[1:31:25] is kind
[1:31:27] love envieth not love vaunteth not
[1:31:30] itself is not puffed up does not behave
[1:31:34] itself unseemly seeketh not her own
[1:31:38] is not easily provoked thinketh no evil
[1:31:42] rejoiceth not an iniquity but rejoices
[1:31:45] in the truth beareth all things
[1:31:48] believeth all things hope with all
[1:31:50] things endureth all things
[1:31:54] charity never faileth but whether there
[1:31:57] be prophecies they shall fail whether
[1:31:59] there be tongues they shall seeks
[1:32:00] whether there be knowledge it shall
[1:32:02] vanish away let's go down to verse 13.
[1:32:06] and now abideth faith hope charity these
[1:32:10] three but the greatest of these is
[1:32:13] charity
[1:32:15] look at the description of love
[1:32:18] love
[1:32:20] suffers
[1:32:23] is kind
[1:32:25] love is not jealous
[1:32:28] love doesn't faunteth itself doesn't put
[1:32:31] itself up
[1:32:32] is not puffed up it's not vain it's not
[1:32:35] proud
[1:32:36] doesn't behave itself unseemly seeketh
[1:32:39] not her own but always seeking the
[1:32:41] welfare of others is not easily provoked
[1:32:44] doesn't get angry every time you bring
[1:32:46] some criticism doesn't get upset every
[1:32:48] time you bring a correction he say it's
[1:32:50] not easily provoked and thinketh no evil
[1:32:54] Rejoice is not an iniquity but rejoices
[1:32:57] in the truth beareth all things
[1:32:59] believeth all things hope all things
[1:33:02] endureth all things charity never
[1:33:06] faileth
[1:33:08] you know what I need more than anything
[1:33:10] else in my life the love of God
[1:33:13] I need the Capstone love of the very
[1:33:16] love of God is the only thing that's
[1:33:18] going to make it through to the end
[1:33:19] every gift must operate by love every
[1:33:22] work must be must have the motive of
[1:33:25] love every service to God must be done
[1:33:27] by love if it's not done by love it's
[1:33:29] vain if it's not done by love it leaves
[1:33:31] you as nothing if it's not done by love
[1:33:33] it profit of you nothing amen all of our
[1:33:36] service all of our works all of our
[1:33:38] gifts all of our giving without love is
[1:33:41] nothing so what do we need greater than
[1:33:43] anything else in our lives we need the
[1:33:45] love of God Amen
[1:33:46] [Music]
[1:33:47] we need love
[1:33:49] said in the latest in church age
[1:33:52] just don't forget don't forget that the
[1:33:55] greatest gift of all gifts is love
[1:33:58] if you want to pray for anything say God
[1:34:01] give me more love
[1:34:03] and not this filial love that becomes
[1:34:05] passionate angry and upset and claiming
[1:34:08] and wants to own and hold no give me the
[1:34:11] true love charity God's love give me
[1:34:14] your love for everything must be
[1:34:16] motivated by love everything must work
[1:34:18] by love Faith worketh by love and
[1:34:20] everything in the kingdom of God is
[1:34:22] apprehended by faith but Faith workers
[1:34:23] by love I have got to have love God give
[1:34:26] me more love fill my heart with love and
[1:34:28] root out all of bitterness all Pride all
[1:34:31] selfishness get it out of me and pour
[1:34:33] your love into me gone
[1:34:36] God is love
[1:34:40] so if you receive love you receive God
[1:34:42] and if you receive God you receive love
[1:34:46] that's why how can we receive the
[1:34:48] message which is Christ which is the
[1:34:50] word of God how can the message make us
[1:34:52] angry and bitter and and contentious and
[1:34:56] bring strife and
[1:34:58] is that the attribute of God but this is
[1:35:01] the word of God this is Christ Christ is
[1:35:03] God's love amen how can I receive the
[1:35:06] message and how can I return around
[1:35:08] receiving the message and act in
[1:35:10] bitterness and act in strife and act in
[1:35:12] Pride in vain glory and all the how can
[1:35:15] I take the message and try to put
[1:35:17] everybody else down and put me up higher
[1:35:19] amen it's not the nature of love love
[1:35:21] does not Bond itself it's not puffed up
[1:35:23] amen seeketh the benefit of others
[1:35:27] so if I've received the message I should
[1:35:29] receive the life of the message which is
[1:35:31] the Life of Christ which is the life of
[1:35:33] God which is the spirit of God and God
[1:35:35] is love amen and God is the word and the
[1:35:38] word is love and the word coming into me
[1:35:40] should bring a greater love in my life
[1:35:42] and that love in my life should give me
[1:35:44] the ability to make myself a sacrifice
[1:35:47] to please my Lord
[1:35:53] the greatest of all gifts is love though
[1:35:55] I speak with tongue of men and angels
[1:35:56] and and have my body to be burned as a
[1:35:59] sacrifice understandeth all knowledge
[1:36:00] and so forth I am nothing
[1:36:04] but when that which is perfect which is
[1:36:06] love
[1:36:07] if all the spiritual gifts isn't
[1:36:09] mortared together with love it won't
[1:36:10] hold
[1:36:11] any other mortar will break away but
[1:36:13] love continueth forever see that is the
[1:36:16] first
[1:36:17] Corinthians 13.
[1:36:21] brother Branham
[1:36:24] says here referring to the incident
[1:36:27] where he stepped into a diner to have a
[1:36:30] sandwich and he saw the sin taking place
[1:36:32] and he saw the older sister there with
[1:36:34] the policemen and the drinking and the
[1:36:36] smoking and he began to condemn it in
[1:36:38] his heart this is what he said he said
[1:36:40] God showed me that in my heart wasn't
[1:36:42] right
[1:36:44] because I was trying to condemn her and
[1:36:47] not looking at what I come from too
[1:36:49] so we can always remember look back to
[1:36:52] the pit where you was hewed from things
[1:36:54] will look a lot different see we don't
[1:36:57] want to condemn no one love everybody
[1:37:00] whenever you lose that real genuine love
[1:37:03] that's in your heart you've lost
[1:37:06] everything
[1:37:08] don't think that we can let the love
[1:37:10] leak out but I still have gifts
[1:37:13] I've lost the love but I still have the
[1:37:15] word no he says when you lost the love
[1:37:17] you've lost everything
[1:37:20] people say I I have the word I've got
[1:37:23] the word the word is right I'm right on
[1:37:24] this subject I've got the word but if
[1:37:26] you don't have love you don't really
[1:37:27] have the nature of the word you have a
[1:37:30] certain understanding of a certain
[1:37:33] Doctrine or a teaching you've got a uh
[1:37:35] you've read certain words and heard the
[1:37:37] prophet or a minister say certain things
[1:37:39] and you've got maybe the correct
[1:37:41] understanding of terms or you got the
[1:37:43] correct understanding of a certain
[1:37:45] teaching a Doctrine amen but without the
[1:37:48] nature of that word you don't have the
[1:37:49] word
[1:37:51] do you understand me without the nature
[1:37:54] of that word you don't have the word
[1:37:56] amen what you have is an intellectual
[1:37:58] understanding of a Doctrine and that
[1:38:01] understanding may be correct but if it
[1:38:03] doesn't bring with it the life of that
[1:38:05] word you don't have the word
[1:38:07] but to have the word is to have the life
[1:38:10] of the word and the word must be lived
[1:38:12] administered taught with the right life
[1:38:15] and that life is love
[1:38:18] I said God help us
[1:38:20] help us
[1:38:22] the word must be taught with love
[1:38:26] the word must be received with love
[1:38:29] the word must be shared with love
[1:38:31] I look back on my life and wonder how
[1:38:33] many of my failed attempts at witnessing
[1:38:37] and some of them were big failures
[1:38:41] how many times I failed at witnessing
[1:38:43] because I didn't witness out of love I
[1:38:45] witnessed out of being correct
[1:38:49] you hear a discussion going on at the
[1:38:51] table next to you somebody asks you a
[1:38:53] question and you know the answer and all
[1:38:55] of a sudden my witnessing becomes my
[1:38:58] desire to prove to them that I'm correct
[1:39:00] and my need for them to acknowledge that
[1:39:03] I'm correct and that becomes the whole
[1:39:05] basis for witnessing
[1:39:07] but it wasn't my love for a soul
[1:39:10] it wasn't my desire to see somebody get
[1:39:12] closer to God
[1:39:13] now if you were to ask me I would have
[1:39:15] said that was
[1:39:18] we've learned how to say the right
[1:39:19] things
[1:39:20] when our hearts going a different
[1:39:21] direction
[1:39:23] but the reality was is I was right I
[1:39:26] knew I was right and I needed this guy
[1:39:27] to agree I was right and somehow if he
[1:39:30] agreed it was right he might go to
[1:39:31] heaven
[1:39:34] I wonder how many times I failed in
[1:39:36] witnessing because I didn't witness in
[1:39:38] love
[1:39:40] I witnessed in my own Pride
[1:39:44] no wonder God didn't melt the heart of
[1:39:46] the person I was talking to they were
[1:39:48] receiving not the word they were
[1:39:49] receiving intellectualism with my pride
[1:39:55] so what were they resisting the word no
[1:39:57] they were resisting my pride
[1:40:00] that's why when you witness that way and
[1:40:02] somebody doesn't agree with you you can
[1:40:03] get upset
[1:40:06] how many started witnessing and wound up
[1:40:08] in an argument
[1:40:14] praise God I should just have an altar
[1:40:17] call right now
[1:40:21] but God motivate me by love
[1:40:24] God I don't anymore want this
[1:40:27] hybridization to rule my life I want
[1:40:30] your spirit to control everything in me
[1:40:33] I want your love I want every action to
[1:40:35] be motivated because I love you because
[1:40:37] I want to please you I don't I'm not
[1:40:40] after the reward I'll be thankful for it
[1:40:42] I'm not after the reward I'm not after
[1:40:44] salvation I believe by faith I have
[1:40:47] those things already but that's not
[1:40:49] what's motivating me anymore I don't
[1:40:50] want to be motivated by those things I
[1:40:52] want to be motivated by my love for God
[1:40:54] that I serve God because I love him I
[1:40:57] obey him because I love him amen I tell
[1:40:59] others I Proclaim of his goodness
[1:41:01] because I love him I share the word
[1:41:02] because I love him and if I share with
[1:41:04] another individual I have to share it
[1:41:06] because I love them too
[1:41:10] foreign
[1:41:12] remember God so loved the world
[1:41:15] he sent his only begotten son
[1:41:21] if you've lost that real genuine love
[1:41:23] that's in your heart you've lost
[1:41:25] everything
[1:41:28] don't ever forget that that when you
[1:41:31] lose love it's all gone
[1:41:34] say God
[1:41:36] keep us in love with you keep pouring
[1:41:39] more love into us God help us to
[1:41:42] surrender and lay down all that
[1:41:44] foolishness that's been bred into us
[1:41:47] all the the pride and the self-love and
[1:41:52] all of those things but I want to lay it
[1:41:54] down help me God
[1:41:56] fill me with more of your spirit as I
[1:41:58] feed on your word day by day
[1:42:00] if we receive the right word that word
[1:42:03] brings with it a life because it's the
[1:42:05] life of the word and the life of the
[1:42:07] word should be able to live that life
[1:42:09] through each of us
[1:42:12] amen let's turn to First John chapter 4
[1:42:14] together
[1:42:16] we'll wind down with this
[1:42:18] I want to read two scriptures as we
[1:42:20] close
[1:42:27] first John 4
[1:42:34] first John 4 17.
[1:42:42] here and as our love made perfect
[1:42:45] that we may have boldness in the day of
[1:42:47] judgment because as he is in the so as
[1:42:50] he is so are we in the world
[1:42:52] there is no fear and love but perfect
[1:42:55] love cast out fear because fear at
[1:42:58] torment he that feareth is not made
[1:43:01] perfect in love we love him because he
[1:43:06] first loved us
[1:43:08] If any man say I love God and hateth his
[1:43:10] brother he is a liar for he that loveth
[1:43:13] not his brother whom he hath seen how
[1:43:14] can he love God whom he hath not seen
[1:43:16] and this commandment have we from him
[1:43:19] that he who loveth God loveth his
[1:43:22] brother also
[1:43:25] you know there is no fear in love
[1:43:29] so I cannot come to God and serve him
[1:43:32] out of love if I'm serving him because
[1:43:35] I'm afraid that he'll condemn me to hell
[1:43:39] he's already answered that question he's
[1:43:41] already paid the price and he's freely
[1:43:43] given us salvation and he's given us a
[1:43:45] heart to be able to believe by faith in
[1:43:48] the price that was paid on Calvary
[1:43:51] and so now there's no motivation fear is
[1:43:54] a terrible motivation if I make
[1:43:56] decisions because I'm afraid God will
[1:43:58] judge me I'm afraid God will condemn me
[1:44:00] I'm afraid God will cast me away that's
[1:44:02] a very poor motivation amen but if I
[1:44:05] didn't make decisions because I want to
[1:44:07] please God and I want to I want to show
[1:44:10] him I love him and I want to do
[1:44:11] something for him that's a that's a pure
[1:44:13] motivation
[1:44:15] and it'll bring totally different
[1:44:16] results and responses in US
[1:44:20] one we do for us one we do for him
[1:44:25] and one set of circumstances everything
[1:44:27] we do we do is for us
[1:44:30] we we serve God so we can go to heaven
[1:44:33] that's for us we serve God so we can get
[1:44:35] rewards that's for us we serve God so
[1:44:37] that we won't be a Castaway that's for
[1:44:39] us we serve God so that we won't be
[1:44:41] judged that's for us we serve God so
[1:44:43] that we'll get the benefits of serving
[1:44:44] God that's also for us
[1:44:48] and I would say that's how the majority
[1:44:50] of human beings serve God
[1:44:54] would you agree
[1:44:56] and I would even admit at times that's
[1:44:58] how I serve God
[1:45:01] but the other side
[1:45:04] is if I get nothing I'll serve him
[1:45:08] I'll love him because he's God and I
[1:45:12] believe this word because it's the truth
[1:45:14] and I want to live it because I know
[1:45:16] it's right and if at the end of the
[1:45:18] journey I get no reward for it I still
[1:45:20] want to do it because it's right amen I
[1:45:23] love him because he's beautiful amen the
[1:45:25] picture that he's painted as he's opened
[1:45:27] his mind and shared his mind makes me
[1:45:28] love him more every Doctrine makes me
[1:45:31] love him more because I see how perfect
[1:45:32] God is how loving he is how much he has
[1:45:35] provided amen and every Doctrine causes
[1:45:38] me to love him more amen the opening of
[1:45:40] The Seven Seals on opening of the entire
[1:45:43] Bible made me love him more and gave me
[1:45:45] a greater desire to please him if I hear
[1:45:48] him cry out amen if I could have but a
[1:45:50] cool drink of water from The Well of
[1:45:52] Bethlehem I want to be one that will run
[1:45:54] and fight and risk my life to get him a
[1:45:56] cool drink of water because it wasn't
[1:45:58] for a reward it wasn't for because the
[1:46:01] the forego punishment they only did it
[1:46:03] because David wanted it
[1:46:07] and I want to serve God because he's
[1:46:09] worthy to be served because he's perfect
[1:46:10] because he's beautiful because his word
[1:46:12] is right I want to buy every word
[1:46:13] because it's right
[1:46:15] not so I can get something out of
[1:46:17] because it's perfect I want to obey
[1:46:19] every word because it's true and because
[1:46:20] I love him and I love his word and I
[1:46:22] love everything about him
[1:46:24] and if I get nothing in this life that's
[1:46:26] still okay with me
[1:46:28] that's the way I want to serve God
[1:46:31] I want to get so far away from this
[1:46:34] self-focused service to God and I want
[1:46:36] to get all the way over here I don't
[1:46:38] know where I am in between but I'm
[1:46:39] asking God to move me God help me help
[1:46:42] me to serve you out of a pure heart
[1:46:46] let's go to First Timothy chapter one
[1:47:08] First Timothy chapter 1 verse 5.
[1:47:14] in the end of the Commandment is Charity
[1:47:17] love
[1:47:18] out of a pure heart
[1:47:20] and of a good conscience and of faith
[1:47:23] unfeigned
[1:47:26] we come to the end of it all this is the
[1:47:28] goal
[1:47:29] the end of the Commandment the end of
[1:47:31] everything what is the end of it all the
[1:47:33] end of the Commandment is love
[1:47:36] what is God looking for love out of a
[1:47:39] pure heart and a good conscience and
[1:47:42] faith unfeigned unfame means without
[1:47:44] hypocrisy with no pretending
[1:47:47] what is God looking for love out of a
[1:47:50] pure heart no selfish motives mixed in
[1:47:53] and a good conscience for the right
[1:47:55] reasons and a faith without hypocrisy
[1:47:59] that's the end of the Commandment
[1:48:02] and there's going to come an end in the
[1:48:05] end time in the end time bride
[1:48:08] and I believe by the grace of God by the
[1:48:10] prophecy that he's given that he's going
[1:48:13] to have a bride that will love him
[1:48:15] correctly
[1:48:16] that will serve him for the right
[1:48:18] reasons and I want so bad to be one of
[1:48:21] those
[1:48:22] that bring pleasure to my Lord
[1:48:24] and let's all stand
[1:48:26] musicians if you'd please come
[1:48:45] the the relationship that we have with
[1:48:47] the Lord the real one the genuine one is
[1:48:50] not the one we have at church
[1:48:53] the walk that we have with our God is
[1:48:55] not the one we have in church
[1:48:57] the real relationship we have with the
[1:48:59] Lord is not the one we have with other
[1:49:00] believers
[1:49:02] but the real relationship we have with
[1:49:04] the Lord is the one we have when it's
[1:49:07] just him and I and nobody's listening
[1:49:09] and nobody's around and nobody knows
[1:49:12] that's the genuine
[1:49:15] remember when brother Branham went to
[1:49:16] the couple of the the he saw those two
[1:49:19] couples that he married one in the
[1:49:20] boxcar by the river and one
[1:49:23] up in the Ivory Tower one up in the
[1:49:25] palace on the hill he snuck up and he
[1:49:28] was listening and he was catching their
[1:49:30] private moments amen when nobody was
[1:49:33] listening they thought nobody was around
[1:49:35] and nobody knew and what did he
[1:49:38] experience there he experienced a young
[1:49:40] man and a young woman that truly loved
[1:49:41] one another was willing to sacrifice for
[1:49:43] one another a man that wanted to give
[1:49:46] all that he had to buy his wife a new
[1:49:47] dress and a woman that says oh that's
[1:49:49] all right I don't really need it anyhow
[1:49:51] she was preferring him he was preferring
[1:49:54] her she was sitting on his lap he had
[1:49:56] his arm around her they were loving one
[1:49:58] another and preferring one another
[1:50:00] that's who they really were that was the
[1:50:03] real marriage
[1:50:05] then he slips up to the Palace to the to
[1:50:08] the the Mansion on the hill and he hears
[1:50:11] them a fussing and quarreling and
[1:50:13] they're fighting about some girl he
[1:50:15] danced with or some boy she danced with
[1:50:17] amen and brother Branham knocked on the
[1:50:19] door or whatever it was that he did and
[1:50:21] all of a sudden he sees him jump up and
[1:50:22] they run across the floor into each
[1:50:24] other's arms they go well hello brother
[1:50:26] Branham how are you he says I'm doing
[1:50:28] well how are you we're fine aren't we
[1:50:31] honey yeah yeah we're doing wonderful
[1:50:34] they made a public appearance but it was
[1:50:36] a lie
[1:50:37] what they were in their marriage when
[1:50:40] nobody was around is who they really
[1:50:42] were that was the real marriage
[1:50:45] it didn't matter what show they put on
[1:50:47] for people how they walked hand in hand
[1:50:49] in public what they were in private when
[1:50:52] nobody was listening the way they spoke
[1:50:53] to each other the way they loved each
[1:50:55] other the way they preferred each other
[1:50:57] the way they treated one another when
[1:50:59] nobody else knew that's the real
[1:51:01] marriage
[1:51:04] the same thing for us and our Lord
[1:51:07] when nobody knows what you're saying to
[1:51:10] God
[1:51:11] what are you saying to God
[1:51:14] are you saying anything
[1:51:17] is there any relationship outside of the
[1:51:20] group relationship
[1:51:21] is there any time spent with the Lord is
[1:51:23] there any communication with him is
[1:51:25] there any prayer time is there any
[1:51:26] meditation time is there any time in his
[1:51:28] word or is the only time that we serve
[1:51:32] God and the only relationship we have
[1:51:34] with God is that church earned the
[1:51:36] fellowship of other believers
[1:51:38] I wouldn't want a marriage like that
[1:51:40] would you
[1:51:42] only have a public marriage no private
[1:51:44] marriage
[1:51:45] but what we are when nobody's listening
[1:51:48] when nobody's around when nobody's
[1:51:51] included that's our relationship with
[1:51:54] the Lord
[1:51:56] and I said God that's what I want to be
[1:51:58] as real as real can be I want that
[1:52:00] relationship go real all the way to the
[1:52:02] Core
[1:52:03] and I wanted to be motivated by love
[1:52:06] not by fear
[1:52:08] nobody's going to come up to you and say
[1:52:09] how much how much time did you spend in
[1:52:11] prayer today
[1:52:15] this is all based on love
[1:52:18] nobody's going to ask you how many hours
[1:52:21] you spent praying nobody's going to ask
[1:52:22] you what you read today nobody's going
[1:52:24] to ask you those questions those are
[1:52:26] private things between you and God
[1:52:28] but that's what I want to be real all
[1:52:31] the way through from top to bottom
[1:52:33] that's the one that matters most to me
[1:52:37] and that's that's the real relationship
[1:52:40] and I said God may you give it to each
[1:52:42] one of us
[1:52:43] May he's willing friends
[1:52:47] now the question is are we willing
[1:52:49] he's always faithful but who will be
[1:52:52] faithful of their own choosing I said
[1:52:54] God make me help me pour your spirit
[1:52:57] into me help me overcome myself
[1:53:00] to come to this place that I want to be
[1:53:03] let's bow our heads and pray
[1:53:05] dear Lord Jesus we thank you
[1:53:08] oh Father how we can
[1:53:11] we can never thank you enough Lord

[1:53:37] placed in us the ability to love you

[1:58:27] we're beyond the age of church
[1:58:31] it's not church anymore
[1:58:33] it's now Pride
[1:58:36] the whole church thing is not what God's
[1:58:38] after we still have church because he
[1:58:40] told us to we still gather as an
[1:58:42] assembly we have a fellowship of
[1:58:43] Believers because that's what we were
[1:58:44] taught to do in the word
[1:58:47] but church is not what God is after in
[1:58:49] this hour
[1:58:51] it's a relationship with his bride
[1:58:54] it's got to go beyond the church it's
[1:58:57] got to go beyond the group it's going to
[1:58:59] come down to the individual connected
[1:59:01] with the Living God
[1:59:03] with a vibrant relationship
[1:59:05] where there's love that's motivating all
[1:59:08] that we say and do
[1:59:10] this is the hour for it
[1:59:12] it's not this is not preaching an
[1:59:14] unattainable goal this is not preaching
[1:59:16] something that's not within our reach
[1:59:18] this is what the word is producing in
[1:59:21] our lives it's producing it day by day
[1:59:24] as we feed on that word amen as we
[1:59:27] Fellowship around it as it's in our ears
[1:59:29] and in our hearts amen as it's preached
[1:59:31] and as we listen to the tapes and read
[1:59:32] the books and read our Bibles amen
[1:59:34] what's happening is Christ is becoming
[1:59:36] more relevant more real more pertinent
[1:59:39] to every moment of Our Lives the
[1:59:41] relationship is growing and he's
[1:59:42] becoming the central theme of all of our
[1:59:45] walking all of our talking all of our
[1:59:47] thinking and all of our affections

[1:59:57] more than she loves anything else and I
[2:00:01] want to be part of that bride I consider

[2:00:04] day for I know the potentials are here
[2:00:08] because I know the word is here in full
