[9:21] let's bow our heads
[9:24] together de Heavenly Father we're so
[9:26] thankful to be here to be able to sing
[9:28] the songs and mean them from their heart
[9:31] Lord not just a tradition not just going
[9:33] through motions but the reality that
[9:35] strikes us deep inside Lord I thank you
[9:38] for that reality and I thank you Lord
[9:41] you've given us a time and a place and a
[9:43] way to express that back to you with our
[9:45] brothers and sisters Lord we thank you
[9:48] for Gathering us together for bringing
[9:49] us here for Watching Over Us Lord as we
[9:52] come to look at your word we pray you
[9:54] would come and help us Lord that you
[9:56] would open our eyes that you would be
[9:58] the one that rubs the I have in our eyes
[10:00] give us eyes to see and ears to hear and
[10:03] a heart to perceive all that you want to
[10:05] speak to us tonight for Lord we set
[10:07] aside this time to commune with you to
[10:10] worship you in spirit and in truth I
[10:12] pray God Lord that you would do what
[10:14] you've promised to do that you would
[10:15] come and feed your sheep but we're
[10:18] surrendering to you now take the
[10:19] preeminence among us we pray in Jesus
[10:22] Christ's name we pray
[10:25] amen amen God bless you this evening
[10:28] it's good to be here here together once
[10:30] again and they say the weather looks
[10:32] like it's going to get
[10:34] bad but it is January you know we've had
[10:37] it pretty good so far so we praise God
[10:40] for that and we thank God that we could
[10:41] be here tonight let's take our Bibles
[10:43] and turn to the Book of Jeremiah
[10:46] together I just want to say is returning
[10:48] there that that this is going to be part
[10:50] one of a two-part and so I say that I
[10:54] preface that because I want it's going
[10:56] to take two parts to get the thought
[10:58] together amen so don't leave you're
[11:00] you're going to leave here today with
[11:02] half a
[11:03] thought amen so there's no way I could
[11:05] have put it all together in one package
[11:07] I I've got two things that I want to
[11:09] share and so I want to lay down this
[11:11] principle first that we're going to go
[11:12] into tonight but if the Lord still leads
[11:15] me the way I feel led today and things
[11:17] go the same way and the direction I feel
[11:19] that it's go on Sunday we'll come back
[11:22] and Lord willing will do part two and
[11:24] these two parts must go together amen
[11:27] and so just remember that that's my
[11:29] preface that's my disclaimer amen let's
[11:31] look together in Jeremiah chapter 7
[11:33] let's turn to Jeremiah chapter
[11:40] 7 Jeremiah chapter
[11:44] 7 and let's look at
[11:49] verse
[11:52] 22 for I spake not unto your fathers nor
[11:55] commanded them in the day that I brought
[11:57] them out of the land of Egypt concerning
[11:58] concerning burnt offerings or
[12:01] sacrifices but this thing commanded I
[12:03] them saying obey my voice and I will be
[12:05] your God and you shall be my people and
[12:08] walk ye in all the ways that I commanded
[12:11] you that it may be well unto you man God
[12:14] bless you as you have your seats keep
[12:16] your Bible open in this spot we're going
[12:18] to continue on from
[12:21] here amen when we look at this if if you
[12:24] back up to verse 21 he says thus sayith
[12:26] the Lord of hosts the god of Israel put
[12:29] your burnt offerings into your
[12:30] sacrifices and eat flesh and that's a
[12:33] strange statement but if you understand
[12:35] that when they offered burnt offerings
[12:37] that was a whole burnt offering unto the
[12:39] Lord it was something that burned on the
[12:40] altar completely to God but when Israel
[12:43] would offer sacrifices amen that
[12:46] sacrifice they would give a portion
[12:48] would go to God a portion would go to
[12:49] the priest and a portion they would keep
[12:51] and it was a sign of them feasting with
[12:53] the Lord all right so part of the
[12:55] sacrifice many times the worshipper
[12:57] would keep and eat in the the priest
[12:59] would eat and then they believe it's
[13:01] symbolic of God also eating so we're on
[13:04] the same page but now he's saying take
[13:07] your burnt offering put it in your
[13:08] sacrifice and you eat the flesh
[13:10] basically God saying I don't want it
[13:12] anymore that if I could boil it down to
[13:15] layman's terms he's saying keep it for
[13:17] yourself I don't want it anymore so now
[13:19] we understand verse
[13:21] 21 then it brings us to verse 22 for I
[13:24] spake not unto your fathers nor
[13:25] commanded them in the day that I brought
[13:27] them out of the land of Egypt concerning
[13:29] burnt offerings or sacrifices he's
[13:31] basically saying the original purpose I
[13:34] had in bringing you out of Egypt was not
[13:36] for burnt offerings and sacrifices that
[13:38] wasn't the whole point amen and when I
[13:40] first brought them out I never spoke to
[13:42] them about burnt offerings or sacrifices
[13:45] that wasn't what I
[13:47] wanted but this is what he says but this
[13:49] thing commanded I them saying obey my
[13:53] voice and I will be your God and you
[13:55] shall be my people and walk ye in all
[13:58] the ways that I have commanded you and
[14:00] it may be well unto you amen and God was
[14:04] saying to them do this amen and keep my
[14:07] Commandments and obey my voice this I
[14:09] didn't talk about sacrifice I didn't
[14:11] talk about all this ritualistic worship
[14:13] all I said was obey my voice that's all
[14:16] I said that's all he wanted all God has
[14:18] ever wanted from the very beginning is
[14:20] somebody that will just obey his voice
[14:23] that was God's desire of people that
[14:25] would just obey him and listen to him
[14:27] and that's where man has failed All
[14:29] Through Time man has failed to simply
[14:32] just obey the voice of God and then he
[14:35] says I I I I desired I spoke to them
[14:39] saying obey my voice and I will be your
[14:41] God and you shall be my people and walk
[14:44] you in all my ways that I have commanded
[14:46] you that it may be well unto you now now
[14:49] God is not saying amen uh walk in all
[14:52] that I command you so that you can make
[14:54] me feel good or that you can amen
[14:56] somehow bless me no he's saying my
[14:59] commandment was for your benefit that it
[15:01] may go well with
[15:03] thee amen it wasn't about amen making
[15:06] God feel good or it wasn't about no God
[15:10] gave commandment for their sake not for
[15:13] his but what did he want he wanted the
[15:15] people that obey his
[15:17] voice
[15:20] so let's turn keep your place right here
[15:23] in Jeremiah 7 if you can put one hand or
[15:25] put a bookmark and go to Exodus 19
[15:32] we're going to read from Exodus 19 and
[15:34] come right back to Jeremiah
[15:36] 7 Exodus
[15:39] 19 we're going to begin reading at verse
[15:42] three this is when they been brought out
[15:45] of Egypt with a mighty hand they've been
[15:47] brought into the Wilderness of sin
[15:49] they've been brought to mount siani and
[15:51] in verse three of chapter 19 it says and
[15:54] Moses went up unto God went up unto God
[15:57] and the Lord called unto him out of the
[15:59] mountain saying thus shalt thou say to
[16:01] the house of Jacob and tell the children
[16:03] of Israel ye have seen what I did unto
[16:06] the Egyptians and how I bear You On
[16:07] Eagle's Wings and brought you unto
[16:09] myself now therefore if you will obey my
[16:12] voice indeed and keep my Covenant then
[16:15] you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[16:17] above all the people for all the Earth
[16:19] is mine and you shall be unto me a
[16:22] kingdom of priest and a holy nation
[16:25] these are the words which Thou shalt
[16:27] speak unto the children of Israel
[16:29] what was the first thing God told them
[16:32] when they come to Mount Si amen he told
[16:34] Moses to tell them if you will obey my
[16:38] voice he says if you will obey my voice
[16:42] and keep my Covenant then you shall be a
[16:44] peculiar treasure unto me above all the
[16:47] people for all the Earth is mine and you
[16:49] shall be unto me a kingdom of of priest
[16:52] and a holy nation amen what did God want
[16:56] God wanted a fellowship God wanted a
[16:58] people to be a peculiar treasure unto
[17:00] him Amen in order for them to do that
[17:03] they had to obey his voice amen they
[17:05] couldn't just walk in their own way they
[17:07] couldn't just go according to their own
[17:09] imagination but he had to bring them
[17:11] into his understanding amen and how did
[17:13] they get to this place in Egypt they
[17:15] didn't get here by their effort they
[17:17] didn't get here by their willpower they
[17:18] didn't get here by their wisdom they
[17:20] didn't get here by their Good Conduct
[17:21] they didn't get here by their obedience
[17:23] how did they get to this place because
[17:25] he kept a covenant he made with Abraham
[17:27] and he came down and rescued them
[17:29] himself it was an unconditional Covenant
[17:32] and he performed his oath and he did
[17:34] what he said he would do and he brought
[17:36] them unto himself he went and got them
[17:39] and brought them unto himself and now
[17:41] he's telling them amen this is where he
[17:43] picks it up in Jeremiah I didn't speak
[17:45] to them about sacrifices I didn't speak
[17:47] to them about burnt offerings all I said
[17:49] was obey my
[17:52] voice why he tells him and if you obey
[17:54] my voice you will be a peculiar treasure
[17:57] yeah amen
[17:59] now I don't think I don't want to I
[18:01] don't I don't want to think carnally on
[18:03] this I don't think he was saying if
[18:05] you'll do this then I'll do this as a
[18:08] reward for you doing this I hope you
[18:12] understand that if you obey my voice
[18:13] I'll reward you no he's just giving the
[18:16] reality if you obey my voice you will be
[18:18] a peculiar treasure in all the Earth cuz
[18:20] nobody else is obeying
[18:23] God this is what you will actually be he
[18:26] was they were already his Delight they
[18:28] were already his inheritance they were
[18:30] already part of the
[18:31] Covenant but if you obey my voice you'll
[18:34] be a peculiar
[18:35] treasure unto me above all
[18:38] people and you shall be unto me a
[18:41] kingdom of priests and a holy
[18:43] nation that's what it's like if you obey
[18:46] the word let's go back to Jeremiah
[18:48] chapter 7
[18:51] now Jeremiah 7:
[18:55] 24 says but they hearken not not nor
[18:59] inclined the ear but walked in the
[19:01] counsels in the imagination of their
[19:03] evil heart and went backward and not
[19:07] forward this has always been the
[19:10] problem God gave them opportunity he he
[19:13] gave him his voice he gave him his word
[19:15] and instead of just simply obeying his
[19:18] word they still walked in their own
[19:20] imaginations according to their own
[19:22] heart and they went
[19:24] backwards it wasn't very far it wasn't
[19:27] very long from the time he spoke to them
[19:29] in Exodus where we just read from Exodus
[19:31] 19:3 it wasn't very long from that
[19:34] moment until Moses was absent 40 days
[19:37] and what did they do they went right
[19:39] back to worship the gods that they had
[19:40] seen in Egypt and they made a golden
[19:42] calf and went right back they went
[19:44] backwards and not forwards amen and all
[19:46] they had to do was obey the voice of the
[19:49] Lord amen it wasn't about burn offerings
[19:52] it wasn't about sacrifices it wasn't
[19:54] about ceremonial worship it wasn't about
[19:56] any of that God wanted a people that
[19:59] would obey his voice
[20:01] amen amen let's let's turn from here
[20:04] back to Genesis chapter 2 this is where
[20:07] it all begins of
[20:11] course and for a
[20:14] title I'd like to write this title down
[20:16] uh like for you to write this title down
[20:19] it it's it's an interesting
[20:22] title the
[20:25] Deliverance is first found in the
[20:27] command
[20:29] commment the Deliverance is first
[20:33] found in the
[20:36] commandment and we're going to look at
[20:39] that and it's becomes self-evident once
[20:42] you look at it the Deliverance is first
[20:44] found in the Commandment why because if
[20:46] we keep the Commandment we never need
[20:49] Deliverance if we keep the Commandment
[20:51] we never need rescued we keep the
[20:53] Commandment we never need God to bail us
[20:55] out because our deliverance that we call
[20:58] for when we get in trouble is actually
[21:00] first found in the Commandment if we
[21:02] keep the Commandment we don't need the
[21:04] Deliverance so the Deliverance that
[21:06] we're constantly seeking and constantly
[21:08] going back the Deliverance is first
[21:10] found in the Commandment if we would
[21:12] just obey his voice we wouldn't need so
[21:14] much Deliverance all the time
[21:17] right let's look at this in Genesis CH
[21:19] 2:1
[21:25] 15 says and the Lord God
[21:29] took the man and put him into the Garden
[21:30] of Eden to dress it and to keep it and
[21:33] the Lord God commanded the man saying of
[21:35] every tree of the garden thou mayest
[21:37] freely eat but of the tree of the
[21:39] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[21:41] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[21:43] eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die so
[21:47] there is the
[21:48] command that is the that is the only
[21:51] commandment he gave to man in the Garden
[21:53] of Eden that's the only instruction he
[21:55] gave to him and everywhere else he said
[21:57] you can freely do this you can freely do
[21:59] that you can eat of every tree you can
[22:01] enjoy you can become a god upon this
[22:03] Earth I've given Eden over into your
[22:06] hands amen and he had absolute Liberty
[22:08] but there was one Commandment that he
[22:10] gave to man and that commandment was
[22:12] don't eat of that
[22:14] tree Amen brother B said in the message
[22:18] leadership he said at the Garden of Eden
[22:20] what caused death and all this sorrow
[22:23] every heartache every little dying baby
[22:25] every rattle in the throat every
[22:27] ambulance scream
[22:28] every hospital every
[22:30] graveyard was because Eve doubted one
[22:33] word not all of it just a it just
[22:36] perverted it now God said man he was to
[22:39] keep every word of God now that's the
[22:41] first of the Bible amen they they were
[22:44] completely delivered free protected safe
[22:47] from all harm from everything amen if
[22:49] they would have stayed with the first
[22:52] commandment if we they would have stayed
[22:54] with commandment Numero Uno they would
[22:57] have never had had another commandment
[22:59] that's right do we understand there
[23:02] would have been no reason for the law
[23:03] there would have been no reason for
[23:04] anything else because they wouldn't have
[23:05] fallen into a sin nature they wouldn't
[23:07] have have digressed and degenerated as
[23:09] human beings amen they wouldn't have had
[23:11] a corrupted mind amen none of the things
[23:13] that we see death would have never set
[23:14] in sickness would have never come
[23:16] corruption would have never come on
[23:17] Earth they would have never been in a
[23:18] hybrid condition all of the things that
[23:21] come later amen that require so much
[23:23] more instruction they would have never
[23:25] needed if they would have kept the first
[23:26] commandment
[23:28] the Deliverance was already embedded in
[23:31] the
[23:32] Commandments amen that's why it's better
[23:34] to obey than to sacrifice amen because
[23:37] obedience that's what God says all I
[23:40] wanted in the beginning was somebody
[23:41] that would obey my voice amen and he had
[23:43] his children on the earth and the only
[23:45] thing he asked them to do was obey his
[23:47] voice concerning this one matter and
[23:49] they failed in that and when they failed
[23:50] in that now it set up a scenario where
[23:53] they had to be
[23:55] delivered amen but the Deliverance was
[23:57] first found in the
[23:59] Commandment so look at Genesis chter
[24:05] 3 verse
[24:09] one now the serpent was more subtle than
[24:11] any beast of the field which the Lord
[24:13] God had made and he said unto the woman
[24:15] yay hath God said ye shall not eat of
[24:18] every tree of the garden and the woman
[24:20] said unto the serpent we may eat of the
[24:22] fruit of the Trees of the garden but of
[24:24] the fruit of the tree which is in the
[24:25] midst of the garden God has said You
[24:27] shall not eat of it neither shall you
[24:29] touch it lest you die and the serpent
[24:31] said unto the woman you shall not surely
[24:33] die for God does know that in the day
[24:35] you eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[24:37] open and you shall be as Gods knowing
[24:39] good and evil and when the woman saw the
[24:43] tree saw that the tree was good for food
[24:46] that it was pleasant to the eyes and a
[24:48] tree to be desired to make one wise she
[24:51] took of the fruit thereof and did eat
[24:53] and gave also into her husband with her
[24:55] and he did eat I love
[24:58] I I I say this it's a redundant
[25:00] statement and it goes without saying but
[25:01] I love the Bible I love how perfect
[25:04] everything is laid out I love that the
[25:06] longer you read it and the more
[25:07] revelation God gives the more perfect it
[25:09] becomes in every jot and every turt and
[25:12] now the the serpent comes to begy and we
[25:15] know he's anointed of the devil we know
[25:17] he's actually possessed of the devil
[25:19] amen and he's here trying to tempt the
[25:21] woman and he comes to her and asks the
[25:23] question about the one commandment the
[25:24] only thing that's withheld Amen in in
[25:27] she says we may eat of the Trees of the
[25:29] garden but of the tree in the midst of
[25:30] the garden we're not to eat of it nor
[25:32] touch it lest we die and he begins to
[25:34] contradict that statement and when he
[25:36] begins to contradict that statement he
[25:38] begins to make he he begins to appeal to
[25:41] a desire in
[25:44] Eve he said for God verse five for God
[25:47] do know that in day you eat thereof then
[25:49] your eyes shall be open and you shall be
[25:51] as Gods knowing good and evil now all of
[25:54] a sudden he he goes beyond the
[25:56] commandment and and he starts to impose
[25:59] his own uh his own interpretation of why
[26:02] God doesn't want you to eat the
[26:05] tree is that right he starts to add to
[26:09] the word by his own interpretation and
[26:12] now he's giving her his idea on why God
[26:16] because God never said why do you
[26:19] understand when God gave the Commandment
[26:20] he never said why he said don't eat of
[26:23] that tree but he never said why not to
[26:24] eat of that tree amen because there's no
[26:27] reason to know why you don't need to
[26:29] know why the protection is in the
[26:31] Commandment even if we don't understand
[26:34] it and that holds true today friends the
[26:37] protection is still in the Commandment
[26:39] even if we don't understand
[26:41] it amen so Eve didn't understand why
[26:46] because God never had said why so she
[26:49] just had the Commandment with no why
[26:51] there was no reasoning behind it there
[26:53] was no
[26:54] explanation without reasoning without
[26:57] explanation without understanding she
[26:59] was still perfectly safe behind that
[27:01] commandment and nothing could ever harm
[27:06] her we think we only should do what we
[27:09] understand and we should only keep
[27:10] Commandments that we understand listen
[27:12] it doesn't matter friends if it comes
[27:14] from the Lord just obey because the
[27:16] protection is behind the
[27:19] word amen so many times amen there's
[27:22] little deceitful serpents that come
[27:24] along and say well you know he said that
[27:26] because and this is there because forget
[27:28] the because amen just take the word at
[27:31] face
[27:32] value and believe it
[27:34] amen brother B said in Satan's Eden Eve
[27:37] did not want to do that but he showed
[27:39] her how it was more wisdom in it she
[27:41] didn't know she wanted to know she
[27:43] didn't understand but she wanted to
[27:45] understand and God told her not to try
[27:47] to understand praise God it wasn't that
[27:50] God said don't try to understand he just
[27:52] gave her no
[27:54] explanation meaning you don't need to
[27:56] understand this
[27:58] amen all you need to do is obey
[28:01] it oh I love it so what did she
[28:06] do she took what the serpent said and
[28:09] when the serpent now began to give his
[28:11] own interpretation of the
[28:13] why she took another look at the
[28:16] tree why now she's trying to discern
[28:20] something figure out whether the
[28:23] Serpent's right or you know what was
[28:26] told she doesn't understand so now she
[28:29] takes another look she readdresses
[28:32] something she should have never
[28:34] readdressed she begins considering
[28:36] things she never should have
[28:39] considered she begins to look at this
[28:41] tree and she begins to say well now look
[28:45] it's good for
[28:47] food and there's nowhere in the
[28:49] scripture that says that's
[28:53] untrue right she looked and it saw that
[28:56] it was good for food
[28:58] she saw that it was pleasant to the
[29:00] eyes and a tree to be desired to make
[29:03] one
[29:04] wise you know I believe all of those
[29:06] things were true I believe that was the
[29:08] characteristics of that tree she was
[29:11] properly Discerning the characteristics
[29:13] of the tree but the problem was when she
[29:15] saw well that's good and that's good and
[29:19] that's good she in herself couldn't see
[29:22] where the bad
[29:24] was she was blind to the problem she
[29:27] could see positive characteristics she
[29:29] could see benefits of the tree because
[29:32] the serpent opened that up to her to
[29:34] where now she's want she wants to know
[29:36] something she doesn't know she wants to
[29:38] understand and God never gave her any
[29:40] inkling of an understanding cuz she
[29:42] didn't need to understand all she needed
[29:44] to do was obey and she was perfectly
[29:47] safe so now the serpent begins to open
[29:50] up this this this scientific
[29:54] side to start to analyze
[29:58] the
[29:59] word and to start to use her own
[30:02] discernment on the word and then after
[30:04] all the discernment when she couldn't
[30:06] find anything bad about the word amen
[30:08] she believed the serpent she was
[30:10] beguiled she was deceived amen and she
[30:12] took of the tree and ate and gave to her
[30:13] husband and he ate with her and then we
[30:15] found out then the whole the whole
[30:18] system came crashing down immediately
[30:21] everything began to fail because
[30:23] immediately they begin to realize that
[30:25] they were naked their eyes were open
[30:27] they realized they were naked now all of
[30:28] a sudden they felt shame they felt fear
[30:31] they felt all kinds of things amen
[30:32] everything God was protecting them from
[30:34] without explaining
[30:37] why they started to realize now what was
[30:40] the implications of leaving the
[30:42] word in the message lean not unto thine
[30:45] own understanding he said but look
[30:47] friends listen nowhere in the Bible were
[30:49] we asked to understand we're not asked
[30:51] to understand it we're asked to believe
[30:53] it believe it by what by faith if you
[30:56] understand it then that makes makes
[30:57] Faith an old you can't understand it but
[30:59] you believe it anyhow if I could
[31:02] understand God I wouldn't have to
[31:03] believe God I do not understand God no
[31:06] man understands God I can't understand
[31:08] the word of God but I accept it I
[31:11] believe it and I'm not asked to
[31:13] understand it praise God Amen you know
[31:18] we we we sometimes have to just be
[31:25] children so let's go to Genesis
[31:39] 22 in Genesis
[31:42] 22 let's read verse one Genesis 22 and 1
[31:47] and it came to pass after these things
[31:49] that God did tempt Abraham and said unto
[31:52] him Abraham and he said behold here I
[31:55] am and he said take now thy son thine
[31:57] only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get
[31:59] thee into the land of Mariah and offer
[32:02] him there for a burnt offering upon one
[32:03] of the mountains which I will tell thee
[32:07] of this is a a Commandment that God now
[32:10] gives to
[32:11] Abraham and God gives him no explanation
[32:15] of
[32:16] why no understanding whatsoever of why
[32:20] he needs to offer Isaac he just tells
[32:23] him to take his son his only begotten
[32:25] son and offer him on Mount Mariah you
[32:27] talk about a
[32:28] trial that's a trial man and it says God
[32:32] tempted him it said I'm sorry it said
[32:35] and it came to pass after these things
[32:36] that God did tempt Abraham this word
[32:38] tempt means test or try God was testing
[32:42] or trying Abraham and he sent him down
[32:45] there now Abraham begins to he takes the
[32:47] boy he takes two servants he takes some
[32:48] mules he begins to go down and and he's
[32:51] going to perform what God's told him to
[32:53] perform but he has no understanding of
[32:55] why there's nothing else there's no
[32:57] explanation God gives nothing else that
[32:58] he can go on he doesn't know what this
[33:00] means he doesn't know what this is all
[33:02] about amen the only thing he knows is
[33:04] that God gave me this sign and the
[33:06] promise of the inheriting all things and
[33:08] the promise of being a nation is in this
[33:10] sign it's in the name Isaac because
[33:12] that's what God told him that's all he
[33:14] has amen he even has his own
[33:16] suppositions he has his own ideas amen
[33:19] because we we find out in the New
[33:20] Testament that go that he offered Isaac
[33:23] amen believing that God was able to
[33:25] raise him from the dead as he re
[33:27] received him from the
[33:28] dead so he had his own idea about how
[33:31] God could do this amen but he didn't
[33:33] have any understanding as to why do you
[33:36] think Abraham knew that this was
[33:37] foreshadowing a father who would offer
[33:39] the promised son for the Salvation of
[33:41] the world he didn't have a clue what he
[33:43] was doing he was just simply obeying
[33:47] God and he comes to verse 11 he says and
[33:51] the angel of the Lord called unto him
[33:52] out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham
[33:55] and he said here am I this is when he
[33:57] had taken his son tied him laid him on
[34:00] the the wood amen he had taken the knife
[34:02] in hand to slay his son and the and the
[34:05] angel of the Lord St stops him verse 12
[34:09] and he said lay not thy hand upon the
[34:11] lad neither do thou anything unto him
[34:13] for now I know that thou fearest God
[34:15] seeing that thou has withheld thy son
[34:18] thine that not withheld thy son thine
[34:20] only son from
[34:23] me I think God was
[34:25] pleased amen
[34:27] God was pleased but God made him go
[34:30] through all the
[34:32] Motions he didn't make it easy I this
[34:36] wasn't an easy commandment to
[34:38] fulfill this wasn't something light or
[34:40] trivial and I can just do that and
[34:42] please the Lord no this was the probably
[34:44] the most costly thing ever to Abraham
[34:46] the most painful difficult thing he'd
[34:48] have to do but God asked him to do it
[34:50] and as he doing it amen God stops him at
[34:53] the last moment because Abraham had the
[34:56] to fully obey and Abraham had to be
[34:58] committed why because Abraham is the
[35:01] father of the faith and we are Seed of
[35:04] Abraham by faith this is the
[35:06] example this is our father and this is
[35:09] the way we should act now let's go down
[35:11] to verse
[35:13] 15 and the angel of the Lord called into
[35:17] Abraham Out of Heaven the second time
[35:19] and said by myself have I sworn sayeth
[35:23] the Lord for because thou Hast done this
[35:25] thing and H has not withheld thy son
[35:27] thine only son that in blessing I Will
[35:30] Bless thee and in multiplying I will
[35:32] multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven
[35:34] and as the sand which is upon the
[35:36] seashore and thy seed shall possess the
[35:39] Gate of his enemy and in thy seed shall
[35:41] all the nations of the earth be blessed
[35:43] because thou Hast obeyed my
[35:48] voice what has God always wanted he's
[35:50] wanted his children to obey his voice I
[35:54] don't think he's changed his mind today
[35:57] brother man was preaching this in 1964
[35:59] in a message called the patriarch
[36:01] Abraham this is what he said what a
[36:03] promise because of obedience obedience
[36:06] is what God wants it was once said
[36:09] obedience is better than sacrifice to
[36:10] obey the Lord is better than any
[36:12] sacrifice that you could do you realize
[36:15] that the the that the churches are
[36:17] caught up in all kinds of
[36:20] sacrifices the church world the nominal
[36:22] Church World they do all kinds of good
[36:25] works and and and there's nothing
[36:27] absolutely nothing wrong with the good
[36:28] works there's nothing wrong with feeding
[36:30] the poor there's nothing wrong with
[36:31] taking up clothes drives there's nothing
[36:32] wrong with missionar work there's
[36:34] nothing wrong with sending Bibles
[36:35] overseas there there's no way you can
[36:37] fault that in any way and call it evil
[36:39] the problem is they're doing sacrifice
[36:42] with no obedience because they
[36:44] completely reject the word of
[36:46] God Amen and so when you we remember
[36:49] with the statement to to obey is better
[36:51] than sacrifice amen it comes from it
[36:54] comes from 1 Samuel when Saul was told
[36:57] to to to destroy the amalekites he was
[37:00] told to utterly destroy the amalekites
[37:02] and he was told to destroy their
[37:04] villages to destroy their cattle to
[37:06] destroy the young to destroy the babies
[37:08] to destroy the women to destroy the men
[37:10] to utterly and completely wipe them out
[37:12] amen but Saul does not completely wipe
[37:15] them out he preserves their King he
[37:17] preserves some of the choices of the
[37:18] animals and he preserves all of that and
[37:20] saves it amen and then when Samuel comes
[37:23] along Samuel comes to him and he says
[37:26] what is this bleeding of sheep that I
[37:28] hear and the Lo of cattle amen and he's
[37:30] saying oh we've we he goes first he says
[37:32] I did what you told me to do I did what
[37:34] the Lord said he says no you didn't do
[37:36] what the Lord said because to do what
[37:38] the Lord says is to do exactly what the
[37:40] Lord says not 90% but exactly what he
[37:43] says that's obedience amen because when
[37:46] we mix obedience with our own desire and
[37:49] alter the word of God to fit our own
[37:51] desire that's actually Rebellion not
[37:53] obedience and we may be able to get
[37:55] brothers and sisters to look at that and
[37:57] think of that as obedience but obedience
[37:59] is 100% not
[38:02] 90 I hope we're on the same
[38:05] page that's
[38:08] obedience and I'll just read it to you
[38:10] out of 1st Samuel 15:22 you don't have
[38:12] to turn there but 1st Samuel 15:22 he
[38:14] says and Samuel said hath the Lord as
[38:17] great Delight in burnt offerings and
[38:19] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[38:21] the Lord this is basically what he told
[38:24] Jeremiah when I brought you out of Egypt
[38:25] I didn't discuss burnt offerings and
[38:27] sacrificing but this that you obey my
[38:31] voice now Samuel saying what do you
[38:34] think pleases God most feeding the poor
[38:37] doing missionary work uh uh visiting the
[38:40] homeless what do you think what do you
[38:41] think he desires the most fasting and
[38:44] prayer and coming to church every
[38:46] service paying tithes and giving large
[38:48] sums in the offering what is more
[38:50] pleasing to him that are obeying his
[38:55] voice
[38:57] he said behold to obey is better than
[39:01] sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of
[39:03] Rams for Rebellion he called what he did
[39:06] rebellion and what did he did mostly
[39:09] obeyed yeah and it was called Rebellion
[39:12] for Rebellion is as the sin of
[39:14] Witchcraft and stubbornness as iniquity
[39:17] and idolatry because thou has rejected
[39:19] the word of the Lord Heath also rejected
[39:22] thee from being
[39:25] King
[39:27] Saul claimed that he kept the word of
[39:30] God and he did
[39:33] partially but through the voice of
[39:35] Samuel we find out how God views
[39:37] that he views that as
[39:41] Rebellion amen let's turn to Leviticus
[39:44] 26
[39:54] together Leviticus
[40:09] 26 verse three Leviticus 26 and verse
[40:13] three if you walk in my statutes and
[40:15] keep my Commandments and do them then I
[40:18] will give you the rain and due season
[40:20] and the land shall yield her increase
[40:21] and the Trees of the field shall yield
[40:23] their fruit and your threshing shall
[40:25] reach into to the Vintage and the
[40:27] Vintage shall reach into the sewing time
[40:29] and you shall eat your bread to the full
[40:31] and dwell in your land safely and I will
[40:33] give you peace in the land and you shall
[40:35] lie down and none shall make you afraid
[40:37] and I will rid evil Beast out of the
[40:39] land neither shall the sword go through
[40:41] your land and you shall Chase your
[40:43] enemies and they shall fall Before You
[40:45] by The Sword and five of you shall chase
[40:48] a 100 and aund of you shall put 10,000
[40:51] to fly and your enemy shall fall Before
[40:54] You by The Sword for I will have have
[40:56] respect unto you and make you fruitful
[40:58] and multiply you and establish my
[41:00] Covenant with you and you shall eat old
[41:02] store and bring forth the old because of
[41:04] the
[41:05] new all of a sudden God is trying to
[41:08] teach them here in Leviticus as they
[41:10] move as they're moving into the land
[41:12] he's trying to teach them all you have
[41:14] to do is obey me and I will take care of
[41:17] everything
[41:18] else this is the lesson that he wants
[41:20] them to learn if you will just obey me
[41:23] amen he he tried to keep it simple it
[41:25] was simple the garden they failed he
[41:27] tried to keep it simple in The Exodus
[41:29] Journey it was really simple and what
[41:31] God was going to do was give them Ten
[41:33] Commandments and that was it he was
[41:34] going to add nothing to that but when
[41:36] they rejected him and ran away from him
[41:38] now came a law of ordinances and the
[41:40] Book of ordinances came what is God
[41:42] trying to do he just really wants to get
[41:45] the people to understand there's only
[41:47] one way and the only way is to hear my
[41:49] voice and Obey and if you'll do that
[41:52] everything will be
[41:54] fine they told them now if you will obey
[41:57] my voice and hearken unto my
[41:59] Commandments to do them I I will send
[42:03] the rain you'll have the Harvest one
[42:05] Harvest will lead to the next Harvest to
[42:07] the next you'll have plentiful you're
[42:08] going to have to get rid of the old
[42:10] because you got to make room for the new
[42:11] you're going to have an abundance of
[42:13] everything no Army will come in here and
[42:15] threaten you but you'll be protected
[42:17] amen no sword will go through your land
[42:19] amen he promises them no pestilence he
[42:21] promises no Beast will come in to do
[42:23] damage he promises in other places all
[42:25] your all your yous will lamb amen all
[42:29] all your heers or all your cows will
[42:31] will will have have have uh uh what are
[42:34] baby cows
[42:35] calves
[42:37] woo praise
[42:40] God now you see what good linguist I
[42:44] am they were absolutely under the
[42:47] blessing of God when they were under the
[42:48] word of
[42:50] God but we see this cycle in Israel how
[42:54] many of you read the Old Testament
[42:57] this is the cycle what is the cycle God
[43:00] gives them the Commandments he tells
[43:01] them he'll bless them if they stay in
[43:02] his word amen they stay for a season and
[43:05] begin to drift and it always starts slow
[43:07] at first and then it gets worse and
[43:08] worse and under the drift all of a
[43:10] sudden Calamity start to come amen bad
[43:13] weather strikes them they have they lose
[43:15] crops enemies start to come in beasts
[43:18] start to multiply amen the their their
[43:20] their their herds start to fail
[43:22] everything around them starts to fall
[43:24] into ruin amen and what's God doing he's
[43:26] trying to drive them back to the word
[43:30] because only the word will work amen
[43:33] remember this whole battle did not start
[43:35] on Earth this started in heaven and
[43:37] there was a rebellion against the word
[43:39] in heaven and now that Rebellion is
[43:41] spelled out to the Earth and God is
[43:43] trying to get his children to do one
[43:45] thing and only one thing stay behind the
[43:48] wall of the word and everything will be
[43:51] fine amen that's the lesson that's the
[43:54] cycle the cycle keeps repeating amen and
[43:57] then they would fall and then they would
[43:59] cry out to the god they would repent he
[44:00] would come in and rescue them and
[44:02] promise protection they would go for a
[44:03] while and they would go back into the
[44:05] same
[44:07] cycle but God's word never
[44:10] fails never fails just like in Eden if
[44:14] they would have stayed behind the One
[44:16] Singular commandment they had there
[44:18] would have never been an
[44:20] ambulance there would have never been
[44:22] anybody died there would have never been
[44:23] old age no starvation no war
[44:27] it's all because they let down the bar
[44:30] on the
[44:31] word let's go to Malachi chapter
[44:46] 3 Malachi chapter
[44:54] 3
[44:57] verse 7 Malachi 3
[45:01] and7 even from the days of your fathers
[45:03] you are gone away from mine ordinances
[45:06] and have not kept them return unto me
[45:09] and I will return unto you sayeth the
[45:11] Lord of host but you said wherein shall
[45:13] we return will a man rob God yet ye have
[45:17] robbed me but you say wherein have we
[45:20] robbed God where have we robbed thee in
[45:23] tithes and offerings ye are cursed with
[45:26] a curse for you have robbed me even this
[45:29] whole nation bring you all the tithes
[45:31] into the storehouse that there may be
[45:33] meat in mine house and prove me now
[45:36] herewith sayeth the Lord of host if I
[45:38] will not open you the windows of heaven
[45:40] and pour you out a blessing that there
[45:42] shall not be room enough to receive it
[45:44] and I will rebuke the devour for your
[45:46] sakes and he shall not destroy the
[45:49] fruits of your ground neither shall your
[45:50] Vine cast her fruit before the time in
[45:52] the fields saith the Lord of hosts same
[45:56] thing same principle same thing we're
[45:58] talking about he says your fathers left
[46:01] my ordinances amen you're under a curse
[46:04] you're he says you're under a curse
[46:06] right now and they're like where how
[46:09] what did we leave and he and and he
[46:11] begins to tell bring him back to the
[46:13] simplistic understanding of tithes and
[46:15] offerings you're under a curse because
[46:17] you've robbed me you've kept back that
[46:19] portion that I've told you to bring your
[46:21] tithe and your offering but he says test
[46:24] me prove me come back to the word repent
[46:27] and return back to the word and see if
[46:29] my word doesn't work see if I won't
[46:33] destroy the devour for your sake see if
[46:35] I won't keep your fruit on the vine
[46:37] until it comes fully right see if I
[46:39] won't preserve your Harvest see just
[46:41] test me and see if the word doesn't work
[46:44] and I say that today why we we we have
[46:47] tested him we've come to the word and we
[46:49] can stand here and say he holds the
[46:51] fruit on the vine amen he he keeps the
[46:54] devour away he prosp ERS He blesses he
[46:57] does that because we have no capacity to
[46:59] do things in ourselves we can't protect
[47:01] ourselves one iota we're weaklings amen
[47:03] we're inept we're unable but by the
[47:06] grace of God we have come to this open
[47:08] book to this word and God has preserved
[47:11] our families he's preserved our children
[47:13] he's preserved Us in every single way
[47:15] that we can be
[47:17] preserved amen we've already we've
[47:20] already tested this and proved that it
[47:24] works
[47:27] amen you know as parents we begin to
[47:31] understand this
[47:33] principle because when you have a when
[47:37] you have a little
[47:38] toddler that's just starting out in life
[47:41] they have no understanding
[47:44] whatsoever is that right no
[47:47] understanding so I'm going to give them
[47:50] Commandments for their
[47:53] sake right to keep them safe to protect
[47:56] them for their prosperity and health and
[47:59] good good
[48:01] fortune but they don't understand
[48:04] neither can I make them
[48:07] understand but if they stay within the
[48:10] confines of my word they will stay safe
[48:13] they won't be harmed they will grow
[48:15] healthy everything will work out for
[48:17] them amen I think it's so wonderful that
[48:19] God Amen allows us to flesh this out so
[48:22] we can begin to understand these things
[48:24] amen that now I mean I cannot make them
[48:29] understand I wonder if God could have
[48:32] made Eve understand all the consequences
[48:36] of leaving the word right she had she
[48:39] had no contrast with which the base the
[48:42] understanding
[48:43] on I don't think she could have
[48:45] understand she was so new she was so
[48:47] fresh let's just say she was so young an
[48:51] inexperienced if I could say it that way
[48:53] yeah it's like you take a child and you
[48:56] have a young child and you're walking
[48:57] into a crowded place maybe you've gone
[48:59] to a fair or to an open market or you're
[49:01] at the zoo or you're someplace amen and
[49:03] you tell that child you stay next to me
[49:05] and never get away from me hold my hand
[49:08] when we walk through here and you don't
[49:09] get without of arms reaching
[49:11] me because you know what kind of evil
[49:15] lurs in the world and you know what
[49:19] people what harm there is to young
[49:20] children and what people will do to
[49:22] young children that's right but you
[49:25] can't make that young child understand
[49:27] that neither would it be responsible for
[49:29] you to scare them by telling them all
[49:31] the possible
[49:34] dangers does that make
[49:36] sense it wouldn't be right it would be
[49:38] wrong for you to terrify them by saying
[49:40] you know what kidnapping is and you know
[49:42] this and there's abuses and yeah you
[49:45] understand what I'm saying that would
[49:47] terrorize them they're too young they
[49:49] can't comprehend they don't understand
[49:51] amen but they don't need to understand
[49:53] all the consequences and all the Evil
[49:56] all they need to understand is one thing
[49:58] a mom and dad are have my best interest
[50:00] in mind and if I listen to them it works
[50:02] out
[50:04] fine that's why we discipline our
[50:06] children they need to understand you
[50:07] have to obey my voice because if you
[50:09] don't obey my voice you could be in
[50:10] serious danger one day that's why when
[50:13] we're at home amen we speak with a calm
[50:15] voice we give calm commands to our
[50:17] children and if they don't obey then
[50:19] they get the repercussion we don't want
[50:21] to get them trained to the level that
[50:22] they only respond when we get louder and
[50:25] louder and get really mad and then
[50:26] they'll finally stop because sometimes
[50:29] they need to respond the first time when
[50:30] you're on a busy street when traffic's
[50:32] going by and you need to say Johnny
[50:34] stand still not Johnny stand
[50:37] still because he's only used to
[50:39] listening
[50:40] then right right why because we're doing
[50:43] it for their benefit
[50:48] am God has been training us to keep his
[50:50] word yeah amen amen because it's the
[50:54] only thing that works
[50:56] it's it not halfway not one foot in one
[50:59] foot out not
[51:00] partial but we've got to come to full
[51:04] obedience to the full word of God that's
[51:07] the day that we live
[51:09] in so we understand this as parents
[51:12] we've seen this work but really the the
[51:16] reality is true for all of us when we're
[51:18] new Believers we don't
[51:21] understand there's so many things we
[51:23] don't understand yes yeah
[51:26] and and there's so many things maybe the
[51:28] prophet says when we're we're a new
[51:30] believer that we don't fully comprehend
[51:32] why he says it and what all is attached
[51:33] to that amen but it's inconsequential
[51:36] whether we understand it or not because
[51:38] the same protection is still available
[51:40] just in
[51:41] obedience amen I don't have to
[51:44] understand it all I have to do is know
[51:45] this is the voice that God sent in this
[51:47] day to direct me amen and I've got faith
[51:50] that this is coming from the word and
[51:51] the word of God always
[51:53] works amen and as new Believers we don't
[51:56] understand just like that little
[51:57] 5-year-old doesn't understand the
[51:59] dangers that are in a crowd doesn't
[52:01] understand the people that are there and
[52:02] what they're capable of but Mom and Dad
[52:05] understand all he's got to do is trust
[52:07] mom and dad and he'll be fine but as
[52:09] that little T ages and he becomes at the
[52:11] age of 15 16 17 amen he begins to
[52:14] understand what he didn't understand
[52:16] before amen not because he's been
[52:18] trained in his natural progression of
[52:20] life and we as new Believers don't
[52:22] always understand every commandment
[52:24] everything the prophet said everything
[52:26] that we've been re all the instruction
[52:28] we've received in this day but it's
[52:30] inconsequential because our protection
[52:32] is in
[52:33] obedience but as we mature all of a
[52:36] sudden the light bulbs start going off
[52:38] that's why that's why that's why that's
[52:41] why amen
[52:44] amen you think of parents you take
[52:47] parents with a teenage
[52:49] daughter amen they're protecting that
[52:51] girl keeping her in modesty amen because
[52:54] they know the danger that lurks out
[52:56] there right and I would say not even the
[52:59] danger that lurks out there amen because
[53:02] there's danger all around us because
[53:04] everybody's in hybrid
[53:05] flesh don't think that the danger is
[53:08] only outside the message the danger
[53:09] could be in the boy sitting next to her
[53:12] because he's also in hybrid flesh and if
[53:14] he's not born again there's danger
[53:19] there do we understand this is real
[53:22] reality friends amen
[53:26] and so we're we're we're taught to dress
[53:30] modestly with shamefacedness and
[53:32] sobriety not with the platting of the
[53:34] hair the outward ad dorant and all these
[53:35] other things and the prophet of God come
[53:37] and reinforce this so well amen but when
[53:39] that girl moves into those teenage years
[53:41] or just prior amen there's a desire in
[53:44] every girl to be pretty brother said
[53:47] it's natural nothing wrong with that
[53:49] it's natural but if if we don't
[53:53] understand we as Parents Ought to
[53:55] understand understand that what the
[53:57] prophet taught us is for our
[53:58] good because if we let that daughter
[54:01] start to dabble around in flat fashion
[54:03] and start to play around I mean with a
[54:05] little bit of this and a little bit of
[54:06] that and she starts to take a little bit
[54:08] of mascara and she just touches a little
[54:10] bit of this and a little bit of that and
[54:12] tries this fashion and tries that hair
[54:14] do amen there may not be anything evil
[54:16] or Wicked in it but I just want to run a
[54:18] scenario past you let's say she tries a
[54:20] little something amen then she goes and
[54:23] and and and it's on the edge and amen
[54:26] yeah and she goes to a youth meeting and
[54:29] that happens to be the day that a boy
[54:31] pays attention to
[54:33] her now what did she just
[54:36] learn that if I get a little fashion and
[54:39] do a little do my hair up a little bit
[54:41] and maybe drop a little uh put a little
[54:44] manicure on my
[54:45] face I'll just say what the prophet said
[54:49] right then it equals attention from a
[54:51] boy right and there the Trap is set yes
[54:56] amen that's it now she's stuck thinking
[54:58] in order to get attention I've got to
[55:01] push these barriers
[55:03] yeah and she doesn't know that that boy
[55:07] may had may had nothing to do with the
[55:10] way she wore her hair that day or the
[55:11] clothes she put on that he may have been
[55:13] attracted to her for her
[55:15] character right yeah and this is the
[55:18] first time he's had a chance to show her
[55:21] but she's attaching it not to character
[55:24] but to looks
[55:26] yeah and then all of a sudden she's in
[55:28] the
[55:29] Trap it's our job as parents to keep
[55:32] them out of these
[55:33] traps because you want your daughter I
[55:36] want my daughter to know that that boy
[55:38] loves her for her that he's attracted to
[55:40] her character amen that she's pretty too
[55:43] she wants to be pretty and she wants him
[55:45] to attracted to her because he's pretty
[55:46] there's nothing wrong with that but
[55:47] natural beauty not the Max Factor
[55:51] yeah amen not cover girl but uncovered
[55:54] girl girl amen the real girl is what we
[55:57] want because it sets up these little
[55:59] traps amen all because we allowed a
[56:01] little experimentation we don't want to
[56:03] be too strict and all of a sudden we're
[56:04] going to have
[56:05] problems when we just listen to what the
[56:08] prophet of God told us it spares us from
[56:10] so much
[56:11] trouble amen and you know that teenage
[56:14] girl doesn't have to understand you can
[56:16] explain you can share but at the end of
[56:17] the day she's protected because there's
[56:19] a mom who's been down this road before
[56:21] there's a mom who understands a girl's
[56:23] heart and how easily it can be ulated by
[56:25] a boy's
[56:29] affection and so it's so much better
[56:33] when she didn't have to do anything
[56:35] special or anything extra and that boy
[56:37] was interested in her anyways and now
[56:40] she spared from the
[56:42] trap
[56:43] amen so these things are examples but we
[56:48] see them as parents we understand them
[56:50] the same thing is true in the gospel the
[56:53] prophet has taught us things that maybe
[56:55] at this stage of life we don't
[56:57] understand maybe in our early days as a
[56:59] Christian maybe we don't quite
[57:01] understand why and maybe the Bible says
[57:03] something I don't quite understand why
[57:04] it's written that way and then the
[57:06] prophet comes and interprets that
[57:07] scripture to us and say this is what it
[57:09] means listen let's just get in the habit
[57:11] of saying God whatever your voice says
[57:13] to me I want to heed that because I've
[57:15] learned from Adam and Eve I've learned
[57:18] amen from The Exodus Journey I've
[57:19] learned from Samuel I've learned from
[57:21] all of these that there's only one thing
[57:24] that you want and you want me to obey
[57:26] your voice and if I obey your voice I'm
[57:27] perfectly
[57:29] safe and me why was it that he loved
[57:31] David so much over Saul because he said
[57:33] he got himself a man David a man after
[57:36] his own heart that will do all my will
[57:39] amen that's what he was looking for
[57:41] that's the king that he set up one that
[57:43] would do all his will that's what God
[57:47] wanted amen let's go to Matthew chapter
[57:53] 6
[57:59] Matthew chapter 6:
[58:06] 25 he says in Matthew verse 6 our
[58:10] chapter 6: 25 therefore I say unto you
[58:13] take no thought for your life what you
[58:15] shall eat or what you shall drink nor
[58:17] yet for your body what you shall put on
[58:19] is not life more than meat in the body
[58:22] more than rment behold the fowls of the
[58:24] air for they sow not neither do they
[58:26] reap nor gather into the barns yet your
[58:28] heavenly father Feth them are you not
[58:31] much better than they which of You by
[58:34] taking thought can add one Cuban into a
[58:36] stature and why take you thought for
[58:39] reignment consider the llies of the
[58:41] field how they grow they toil not
[58:43] neither do they spend and yet I say unto
[58:45] you that even Solomon in all of his
[58:47] glory was not AR raid like one of
[58:50] these wherefore if God so clothed the
[58:53] grass of the field which the day is
[58:55] which today is and tomorrow is cast into
[58:57] the oven shall he not much more clothe
[59:00] you oh ye of little faith therefore take
[59:03] no thought saying what shall we eat or
[59:05] what shall we drink or wherewith shall
[59:06] we be clothed for after all these things
[59:09] do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly
[59:11] father knoweth that you have need of
[59:13] these things but seek ye first the
[59:15] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[59:19] all these things shall be added unto you
[59:23] it sounds like the same promise that he
[59:24] gave to the
[59:26] Israelites that if you obey my voice and
[59:28] follow through my commandment I will
[59:30] give you I will take care of all of
[59:31] these things it sounds very similar to
[59:33] that to me here in the New Testament
[59:35] seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and
[59:37] all of these things your reignment your
[59:39] clothes and everything else it'll be
[59:40] taken care of amen amen seek the word of
[59:44] God first seek the kingdom of God first
[59:46] and God will take care of everything
[59:49] else amen there was a uh some examples
[59:54] that I I wrote wrote down some other
[59:55] examples I just I like the practicality
[59:58] of the word there's so many times that
[1:00:01] we get into problems in our families we
[1:00:03] get into uh trials let's say we get into
[1:00:05] a marital situation where there's
[1:00:07] marital strife and and then all of a
[1:00:09] sudden we need deliverance we cry out to
[1:00:10] God save our marriage save our Deliver
[1:00:13] Us help us and we go to the pastor we go
[1:00:15] to counsel we do whatever we can we get
[1:00:17] everybody
[1:00:18] praying that's
[1:00:21] wonderful but the Deliverance was
[1:00:23] already in the Commandments yeah amen if
[1:00:25] you go back to Ephesians and just take
[1:00:27] what Paul the Apostle
[1:00:29] said husbands love your wives as Christ
[1:00:32] love the
[1:00:37] church wives see that you reverence your
[1:00:41] husbands no matter what kind of trouble
[1:00:43] you find yourself in and no matter what
[1:00:45] kind of problem comes your way if we'll
[1:00:47] just work it back to the word I
[1:00:49] guarantee there's a breakdown in that
[1:00:51] Simplicity of that Commandment that the
[1:00:53] Apostle Paul we br broke it down
[1:00:55] somewhere either that man did not love
[1:00:57] his wife the way Christ loves the church
[1:00:59] or that wife was not reverencing her
[1:01:01] husband and it brought a breakdown in
[1:01:03] the family and we we could call it all
[1:01:05] kinds of we stress because of work and
[1:01:06] the finances are this and the kids are
[1:01:08] that no the reality is somewhere we
[1:01:10] stopped obeying the word and when we
[1:01:12] left the word amen we left the
[1:01:15] protection of the word and now we got
[1:01:17] all kinds of tension and strive when
[1:01:19] what we need to do is repent and come
[1:01:20] back to the word and God will bless his
[1:01:23] word amen yes amen we we we come to the
[1:01:28] stage where we have teenagers and and
[1:01:30] the whole world expects that teenagers
[1:01:32] are problems they're all problems listen
[1:01:34] I have raised five teenagers and they've
[1:01:36] been no problem
[1:01:39] whatsoever and it's not because I'm
[1:01:43] smart has nothing to do with that but I
[1:01:46] absolutely believe the word of God that
[1:01:48] there's a promise in that word amen and
[1:01:50] if I do what the scriptures tell me to
[1:01:52] do in discipline and requiring obedience
[1:01:54] keeping them in the word keeping the
[1:01:56] atmosphere in my home I believe with all
[1:01:57] my heart that God will keep the devour
[1:02:00] away from my door I believe with all my
[1:02:02] heart amen you know I'm speaking in
[1:02:05] generalities I know that bad things can
[1:02:07] happen in difficult situations I don't
[1:02:08] want anybody feel condemned but the
[1:02:10] reality is God has made us promises and
[1:02:13] if we stay behind the word it has to
[1:02:15] work
[1:02:16] friends it's got to work and we can say
[1:02:18] what do I do about my rebellious child
[1:02:20] they won't listen to me they won't do
[1:02:22] anything I say they won't the problem
[1:02:24] was not 16 177 the problem started at 12
[1:02:28] months 18 months when you didn't do what
[1:02:31] the Bible said to train a child in the
[1:02:33] way should go and when he's older he'll
[1:02:35] not
[1:02:36] depart brother R said it's not child
[1:02:39] delicacy it's parent
[1:02:41] delinquency is the problem so you can
[1:02:44] see it's the simple obedience to the
[1:02:47] word of God and letting the word shape
[1:02:49] our lives that is protecting us from so
[1:02:51] much trouble amen I mean we can just
[1:02:54] look around we are a spared
[1:02:58] people I don't know I mean and most of
[1:03:01] you have jobs have families have
[1:03:05] associations outside the framework of
[1:03:07] the
[1:03:08] church and you see the catastrophe that
[1:03:11] are striking lives
[1:03:13] everywhere not just rebellious children
[1:03:15] now children addicted to
[1:03:17] drugs at young age promiscuity amen all
[1:03:21] kinds of horrible things that people are
[1:03:23] dealing with and we don't have to deal
[1:03:25] with it why don't we have to deal with
[1:03:27] it am man wasn't it cuz we're a better
[1:03:29] people cuz we're smarter cuz we're wiser
[1:03:30] because we got our ducks in a row it has
[1:03:33] nothing to do with that this is simply a
[1:03:35] product of obedience to the word of God
[1:03:37] we have come to the word we have
[1:03:39] practiced the word and the word has
[1:03:41] produced the results that he promised it
[1:03:43] would be produce it's not a mystery it's
[1:03:46] a
[1:03:47] reality amen
[1:03:50] yes amen it's
[1:03:53] simple it's the simple things that are
[1:03:56] overlooked and neglected that become big
[1:03:59] problems and then we want rescued down
[1:04:02] the road we need a deliverance we need a
[1:04:04] miraculous solution to our problem but
[1:04:07] the solution the Deliverance was
[1:04:09] embedded in the Commandment right the
[1:04:13] Commandment held the
[1:04:16] Deliverance but because we're a fallen
[1:04:18] people so many times we failed with the
[1:04:22] commandment and now we're reaping what
[1:04:24] we
[1:04:26] sow I think we should all be encouraged
[1:04:29] just to keep the word of God say God put
[1:04:31] a hard in me to keep it God open your
[1:04:34] word to me give me give me understanding
[1:04:36] give me wisdom give me all the tools I
[1:04:38] need just to Simply obey your word
[1:04:40] because I failed I failed I failed but I
[1:04:42] don't want to fail anymore because
[1:04:44] there's consequences for being outside
[1:04:46] of the word there's blessings for being
[1:04:47] in the
[1:04:50] word amen so many times that we CR cry
[1:04:54] out to God for deliverance from medical
[1:04:56] conditions and and and God you've got to
[1:04:58] save us from this sickness you got to
[1:05:00] save us from this disease I mean you
[1:05:01] take for example diabetes God you got to
[1:05:03] save me from diabetes but they proven
[1:05:06] diabetes in in many many cases is linked
[1:05:09] to
[1:05:10] diet it's no mystery anymore it's the
[1:05:13] American
[1:05:15] diet so we've been instructed how to
[1:05:18] take care of these
[1:05:19] temples smoking
[1:05:22] drinking things that are harmful
[1:05:25] using of tobacco and if we would just do
[1:05:28] what has been told it would spare us so
[1:05:31] many
[1:05:32] things we'd be spared by what simple
[1:05:36] obedience to the word of
[1:05:38] God
[1:05:40] Amen we need to say that word is for my
[1:05:46] good amen every word of God is for my
[1:05:50] good and I'll just stay with the word so
[1:05:53] many problems we don't face and we won't
[1:05:55] face because of obedience to the
[1:05:58] word God is good let's go over to the
[1:06:01] Book of
[1:06:05] John John chapter
[1:06:11] 8 verse
[1:06:14] 51 now we've come into the New Testament
[1:06:17] and we're going to listen to the words
[1:06:19] of Jesus John
[1:06:21] 8:51 verily verily I say unto you
[1:06:24] if a man keep my saying he shall never
[1:06:26] see
[1:06:28] death let's go to verse
[1:06:31] 14 or chapter 14 sorry let's go over to
[1:06:34] John Chapter
[1:06:38] 14 verse
[1:06:43] 15 if you love me keep my
[1:06:47] Commandments verse
[1:06:50] 23 Jesus answered and said unto them if
[1:06:52] a man love me he will keep my words and
[1:06:55] my father will love him and we will come
[1:06:56] in we will come unto him and make our
[1:06:59] Abode with him he that loveth me not
[1:07:03] keepeth not my sayings and the word
[1:07:05] which you hear is not mine but the
[1:07:07] Father which sent me let's go to chapter
[1:07:11] 15 verse
[1:07:13] 9 chapter
[1:07:16] 15:9 as the father had loved me so have
[1:07:19] I loved you continue in my love if you
[1:07:23] keep my Commandments you shall abide in
[1:07:25] my love even as I have kept my father's
[1:07:27] Commandments and abide in his love these
[1:07:31] things have I spoken unto you that my
[1:07:33] joy might remain in you and that your
[1:07:35] joy might be
[1:07:37] full how is your joy going his Joy going
[1:07:39] to remain in you and how's our joy going
[1:07:40] to be full when we keep his
[1:07:43] Commandments it's that simple there's a
[1:07:45] promise that comes with it it's not just
[1:07:47] for the Old Testament this is for the
[1:07:49] New Testament too let's go to 1
[1:07:51] Corinthians chapter
[1:07:52] 14
[1:07:55] 1 Corinthians Chapter
[1:08:03] 14 verse
[1:08:08] 36 First Corinthians
[1:08:11] 14-36 what came the word of God out from
[1:08:14] you or came it unto you only if any man
[1:08:16] think himself to be a prophet or
[1:08:18] spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[1:08:20] things that I write unto you are the
[1:08:22] Commandments of the Lord
[1:08:24] amen now Jesus said if you love me keep
[1:08:28] my Commandments now the Apostle Paul
[1:08:30] says if you're a prophet or spiritual
[1:08:32] acknowledge that the things that I write
[1:08:33] unto you they are the Commandments of
[1:08:35] the Lord so now it's not just keeping
[1:08:37] just what Jesus said but now what Paul
[1:08:39] said because what Paul said are also the
[1:08:41] Commandments of the Lord amen and see
[1:08:44] this is what this is the foundation that
[1:08:46] the early church was built on uh Paul
[1:08:48] the Apostle says I am the chief master
[1:08:50] builder I have laid the foundation and
[1:08:52] the and we know the foundation the Chief
[1:08:54] Cornerstone with Jesus Christ and it was
[1:08:56] the foundation of the Apostles and the
[1:08:58] prophets and he says I have laid the
[1:09:00] foundation of the chief master builder
[1:09:02] be careful how you build on because he
[1:09:04] brought the word amen that was to lead
[1:09:06] this first church out but what happened
[1:09:08] in the first church age a white horse
[1:09:10] rider came in and began a deviation off
[1:09:12] the teachings of Paul amen and what
[1:09:16] happened we know church history we know
[1:09:18] what happened it didn't go up it went
[1:09:20] down it started to decline it started to
[1:09:22] deteriorate until it moved Into the Dark
[1:09:24] Ages why because it had left the
[1:09:26] teaching of the Apostles and Prophets
[1:09:28] with Jesus Christ being the Chief
[1:09:30] Cornerstone there was a blessing
[1:09:32] attached to the word there's a curse
[1:09:34] from leaving the
[1:09:36] word but God wasn't going to leave it in
[1:09:39] ruin he was going to bring it out how
[1:09:40] was he going to bring it out he was
[1:09:42] going to bring it out by restoring the
[1:09:43] word and as he restores the word when
[1:09:46] they come to the word blessings start
[1:09:48] pouring back in and there's a
[1:09:50] restoration of the brid
[1:09:52] tree praise be to
[1:09:56] God so here's what brother Brenham
[1:10:01] says in uh Balman Gilead so I want to
[1:10:05] tie everything together with these last
[1:10:07] few statements if you'll just stay with
[1:10:10] me said notice how that's just because
[1:10:14] the preachers just let down let it come
[1:10:17] right in the church finally just
[1:10:19] gradually creeping in a little bit like
[1:10:21] this and I sat and talked to an old
[1:10:22] Methodist preacher not long long ago
[1:10:24] used to sing a song we let the bars we
[1:10:26] let down the bars we let down the bars
[1:10:29] we compromise with sin we let down the
[1:10:31] bars the Sheep got out but how did the
[1:10:33] goats get in and then brother RM says
[1:10:36] this well I think his song really
[1:10:39] expressed it you let down the bars
[1:10:41] that's all you just let down the bars
[1:10:43] one came in and he began to talk he
[1:10:46] began to talk it this way and they begin
[1:10:48] to look and he prospered a little bit
[1:10:50] and he said well if Jones can do it Dr
[1:10:52] Jones I can too and the first thing you
[1:10:54] know there it goes and it's just like
[1:10:57] the old tobogan slide you slip around on
[1:10:59] it how many remembers old tobogan slide
[1:11:01] you sit down keep slipping around real
[1:11:03] easy seeing how close you can get to the
[1:11:05] edge and all before you know it down you
[1:11:09] went that's what happened to the
[1:11:11] Pentecostal church that's right don't
[1:11:13] see how close you can get to it see how
[1:11:15] far you can stay away from it yeah amen
[1:11:18] he said one time there was a driver had
[1:11:20] to ascend the mountain and a man had to
[1:11:22] hurry and get across the mountain
[1:11:24] and so they said one driver walked up he
[1:11:26] said I'm such a perfect driver I can
[1:11:29] drive these six head of horses in my
[1:11:30] Carriage within six in of that Rim
[1:11:33] across that great thousand foot ledge I
[1:11:35] can drive it in 6 Ines of full gallop
[1:11:38] and never fall that's pretty
[1:11:42] good and there was and another driver
[1:11:45] stepped up said sir let me take it I can
[1:11:48] drive within 4 in of it at full gallop
[1:11:50] and never fall there was an old fellow
[1:11:53] just standing standing over there
[1:11:54] looking the man wanted to go across the
[1:11:56] mountain he said what about you sir he
[1:11:58] said well look Mister according to what
[1:12:00] they're talking they're better drivers
[1:12:02] than what I am I hug the wall I don't
[1:12:05] take any
[1:12:07] chances he said you take me
[1:12:11] across see don't see how close you can
[1:12:14] get to sin without sinning see how far
[1:12:17] you can stay away from it that's the way
[1:12:19] it is keep off the territory alog
[1:12:22] together yes that's the way I want a
[1:12:24] church that's the church I want to
[1:12:26] belong to one that shuns the very
[1:12:28] appearance of sin and get away from it
[1:12:32] this is good
[1:12:33] advice it's good advice it's good advice
[1:12:36] that will get labeled legalism many ways
[1:12:38] but how is it legalism to want to fully
[1:12:40] obey the word of God explain that to me
[1:12:44] to want to know that if God spoke it if
[1:12:46] God restored this word and God told us
[1:12:48] do this don't do this there's a reason
[1:12:50] behind it even if I don't understand the
[1:12:52] reason it's not for me to start doing
[1:12:54] like Eve did and analyzing why he said
[1:12:57] what he said and maybe he meant this I I
[1:12:59] don't want to fall back into that trap
[1:13:01] and find myself somewhere down the road
[1:13:03] derailed amen because I didn't simply
[1:13:06] just obey the voice that God sent in our
[1:13:08] day I know that sounds simplistic
[1:13:10] friends but it's absolutely the reality
[1:13:12] that we face I have I I have not been
[1:13:15] around a long time and I am not ped a
[1:13:17] long time and I also have not been a
[1:13:19] Believer for a very long time but in the
[1:13:21] time that I have I have already seen
[1:13:23] that very same set of sequence of events
[1:13:26] play out and in the end it it ends in
[1:13:28] disaster you have people who no longer
[1:13:30] believe the message they have their
[1:13:31] children who go Wayward and all kinds of
[1:13:33] things happen why they wanted to play
[1:13:35] around with the boundary amen and they
[1:13:37] wanted to gallop at full speed close to
[1:13:39] the edge amen and they wanted to analyze
[1:13:42] again why this was taught and why this
[1:13:44] and why that stop playing scientist amen
[1:13:48] and come back to the Simplicity of
[1:13:50] saying God your word is for my benefit
[1:13:52] it's for my my good you sent a prophet
[1:13:55] to me to help me to stay in the lane
[1:13:58] that you've called me to to bring us
[1:13:59] back to the faith of the
[1:14:02] fathers amen it's not for
[1:14:05] me remember remember the vision that
[1:14:08] somebody came and told uh brother
[1:14:10] brandham about brother brandham all of a
[1:14:11] sudden he was he was up on a mountain
[1:14:14] and he was up on another mountain and
[1:14:15] I'm just going off memory so I may have
[1:14:17] a few details wrong and he was this man
[1:14:19] had followed him and he was riding up on
[1:14:21] a white horse and finally he found him
[1:14:22] over on another mountain and he said
[1:14:24] brother B how do I get there he said you
[1:14:26] have to be called of God to be up
[1:14:29] here and he said in the vision he looked
[1:14:31] down at the base of the mountain and
[1:14:34] there were scientists nixing
[1:14:38] things while the prophet was on the
[1:14:40] scene
[1:14:42] scientist and he screamed with a loud
[1:14:44] voice I think it was when he said I must
[1:14:46] ride this Trail again but something he
[1:14:49] screamed and it said it shook everything
[1:14:51] and the scientist looked up they heard
[1:14:54] it but they went down and started mixing
[1:14:57] again I'm saying leave our own minds and
[1:15:00] science out of this
[1:15:02] thing come back to Childhood
[1:15:05] Faith come back to be a child of the
[1:15:08] Kingdom a child of God in sincerity we
[1:15:13] want to we want to keep the blessings
[1:15:15] that God's given us and I know I'm
[1:15:17] preaching through the choir again just
[1:15:19] like on Sunday I know that cuz we're
[1:15:21] blessed we're protected we're saved but
[1:15:24] the devil has never stopped
[1:15:27] trying he hasn't taken a holiday he
[1:15:29] hasn't taken a day off and he's not
[1:15:31] going to stop trying how did he start in
[1:15:33] the first change with a white horse that
[1:15:36] looked like Christ it looked innocent it
[1:15:38] looked
[1:15:39] good but it was a deviation from the
[1:15:42] word so what tactic is he going to use
[1:15:45] now amen I believe he'll probably use
[1:15:46] the same tactic and I don't want to get
[1:15:48] swept into that and if it means I have
[1:15:50] to be a little bit naive and childlike
[1:15:52] and just just do what's said and maybe
[1:15:54] not even understand and somebody say
[1:15:56] well why I don't know why why did the
[1:15:59] bible say that why did brother say I
[1:16:01] don't know why he said that he just said
[1:16:05] it maybe I don't want to take a look
[1:16:08] like eve took a
[1:16:10] look maybe I just want to stay with the
[1:16:12] word of God maybe I just want to stay
[1:16:15] with the message that he's given us God
[1:16:18] knew what vessel he
[1:16:20] chose he chose the right one amen he
[1:16:23] knew what would be
[1:16:26] taught and if God saw fit to bring it
[1:16:29] that way then why would I analyze it and
[1:16:33] just say God help me help me Lord help
[1:16:36] me to surrender help me to know help me
[1:16:39] to grow help me whatever whatever I need
[1:16:41] help with Lord help me I don't even know
[1:16:44] what I need help with but I know that I
[1:16:46] need help
[1:16:47] amen let's go to first
[1:16:52] John
[1:16:54] 1 John Chapter
[1:17:01] 2 1 John Chapter
[1:17:07] 2 1 John 2 and
[1:17:11] three and hereby we do know that we know
[1:17:14] him if we keep his Commandments he that
[1:17:17] saith I know him and keepeth not his
[1:17:19] Commandments is a liar and the truth is
[1:17:21] not in him but who so keep keepeth his
[1:17:23] word in him verily is the love of God
[1:17:25] perfected whereby know we that we are in
[1:17:28] him he that saith he abideth in him
[1:17:31] ought himself also to walk even as he
[1:17:35] walked amen let's go over to chapter
[1:17:38] five John chapter 5 verse
[1:17:47] 1 John 5:1 whosoever believeth that
[1:17:51] Jesus is the Christ as born of God God
[1:17:53] and everyone that loveth him that begot
[1:17:56] everyone that loveth him that begat
[1:17:59] loveth him also that is begotten of him
[1:18:02] by this we know that we love the
[1:18:03] children of God when we love God and
[1:18:05] keep his Commandments for this is the
[1:18:07] love of God that we keep his
[1:18:09] Commandments and his Commandments are
[1:18:12] not Grievious amen for whatsoever is
[1:18:15] born of God overcometh the world and
[1:18:17] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:18:19] world even our faith am oh his his
[1:18:25] Commandments are not
[1:18:26] Grievious but they're delightful because
[1:18:29] I know what they are their protection
[1:18:32] their life their
[1:18:34] freedom they're not
[1:18:36] restriction so many times the devil will
[1:18:39] try to make God's word look like
[1:18:42] restriction restriction on who can marry
[1:18:45] and who can't restriction on who can
[1:18:47] preach and who's not eligible to preach
[1:18:50] it looks like restriction that's not
[1:18:52] restriction that's Freedom amen that's
[1:18:55] blessing that that's safety that's
[1:18:57] security that's where God wants to keep
[1:19:00] his
[1:19:01] children in the message Shalom brother B
[1:19:03] says it's a symphony se you find it
[1:19:06] comes to a junction everybody is all
[1:19:08] wondering I call it a junction and in in
[1:19:11] Shalom if you know the message Shalom
[1:19:12] brother bram's talking about going amen
[1:19:14] I think it was to the high school
[1:19:15] orchestra and he saw them do a
[1:19:17] production of Peter and the Wolf and in
[1:19:19] Peter and the Wolf they act out the
[1:19:20] parts with the different instruments and
[1:19:23] he he got inspiration there at the high
[1:19:25] school orchestra and he brought it up
[1:19:27] here in Shalom and he starts to talk
[1:19:29] about there's certain Junctions and as
[1:19:31] the beat starts getting closer together
[1:19:32] there's a transition coming and those
[1:19:34] who are in the symphony and those who
[1:19:36] read the sheet music they can see it's
[1:19:38] time for a transition and when it starts
[1:19:40] to beat they know what's coming next
[1:19:42] amen and that's what he's talking about
[1:19:44] here he says he goes I don't know music
[1:19:46] a musician in here why he he'd forgive
[1:19:49] me of my rude way but it's there a
[1:19:51] beating out got to have have something
[1:19:53] to act it'll get real low way down you
[1:19:56] wonder what it is but see if you get
[1:19:58] into the rhythm of it you understand it
[1:20:01] that's the only way you'll ever
[1:20:02] understand God is to get into the rhythm
[1:20:04] of
[1:20:05] it what is it how will I brother bam I'm
[1:20:09] just as true a Methodist Baptist or
[1:20:11] Pentecostal that's not the

[1:20:40] said it the word is God God's rhythm is
[1:20:43] obeying his word that's why we never
[1:20:47] understand the message standing outside

[1:20:51] message the only way we will understand
[1:20:53] this message is get into the Rhythm the

[1:21:18] of time and we got to make a surrender
[1:21:20] to that word and lay ourselves be amen
[1:21:23] and then we'll get into the rhythm of
[1:21:25] God's word we'll be in the
[1:21:29] symphony Amen in Colossians 1:18 he says
[1:21:32] and he is the head of the body the
[1:21:35] church who is the beginning the
[1:21:36] firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:21:38] things he might have the
[1:21:43] preeminence amen the preeminence that he
[1:21:46] might have in all things the preeminence
[1:21:48] and that preeminence is to be first to
[1:21:50] hold the first place am man he's become
[1:21:53] the head why so he can have the
[1:21:56] preeminence what is the preeminence
[1:21:58] first place first place in what maybe
[1:22:01] first place in my heart maybe first
[1:22:03] place in my life first place in the
[1:22:06] church and he is the word what should
[1:22:10] have preeminence the word what is the
[1:22:13] headship the word and the message Christ
[1:22:17] is the mystery of God revealed now see
[1:22:19] the whole threefold three-fold purpose
[1:22:21] to express himself he wants to become
[1:22:24] now the world is lost now he has to
[1:22:27] express himself in a man to become a
[1:22:29] savior to the reconciliation of the
[1:22:31] blood from his cross now he had to
[1:22:33] become that to die in order to save and
[1:22:35] to bring himself back into the church to
[1:22:38] have the preeminence in his church now
[1:22:40] remember it cannot and will not and
[1:22:42] never will never has been a denomination
[1:22:45] he has to have the preeminence and he is
[1:22:48] the word that's the day we live in and
[1:22:52] Christ is the mystery again he says his
[1:22:54] purpose that's why he died that's the
[1:22:57] second fold of his three-fold
[1:22:58] manifestation first to express himself
[1:23:01] in Christ then Express himself through
[1:23:03] the church and the same thing Christ was
[1:23:05] the word and the word be and the church
[1:23:08] becomes the word when it lets the word
[1:23:10] go through them what are we here for to
[1:23:14] become the word how do I become the word
[1:23:16] when I let the word go through me I must
[1:23:19] surrender to the headship of the word he
[1:23:22] must have preeminence and brother bam
[1:23:23] told us in that great mystery of God
[1:23:25] that was in the back part of God's mind
[1:23:27] it came forth in a three-fold manner the
[1:23:29] first was to get preeminence in a man he
[1:23:31] did that in Christ Jesus what did
[1:23:33] preeminence look like he said I only do
[1:23:35] that which the father shows me amen now
[1:23:38] he's to get preeminence in his bride in
[1:23:40] the church amen what's that going to
[1:23:41] look like I only do that which the word
[1:23:43] shows
[1:23:44] me that's where we're living today that
[1:23:47] he's got to get preeminence in us all of
[1:23:50] us every member of the Bride but also so
[1:23:52] he's got to have full preeminence in me
[1:23:54] every area of My Life The Doors within
[1:23:56] the doors within the doors he's got to
[1:23:58] have preeminence in my thought life in
[1:24:01] my secret life in my public life in my
[1:24:03] church life and my home life and my work
[1:24:05] life in every life he's got to have
[1:24:07] preeminence that's the day we're living
[1:24:11] in I'd like to turn together to
[1:24:13] ecclesiastic I want to read two more
[1:24:14] scriptures and if we could turn to
[1:24:17] Ecclesiastes
[1:24:21] together and
[1:24:23] Ecclesiastes is written by
[1:24:27] Solomon who was the wisest man on Earth
[1:24:29] at the time and Ecclesiastes he's
[1:24:32] struggling with the vanity of life and
[1:24:35] he's expressing how life goes and the
[1:24:38] vanity of life and and and there's
[1:24:40] nothing new other the Sun but everything
[1:24:42] keeps repeating and and he's got a whole
[1:24:44] dialogue in Ecclesiastes on this
[1:24:46] subject but he comes to the end chapter
[1:24:49] 12 he comes down to the very end verse
[1:24:51] 13 and he says Ecclesiastes
[1:24:56] 12:13 let us hear the conclusion of the
[1:25:00] whole matter this is at the end after
[1:25:02] he's went through all of these vanities
[1:25:05] and all of these things and let us hear
[1:25:09] the conclusion of the whole
[1:25:10] matter fear God and keep his
[1:25:13] Commandments for this is the whole duty
[1:25:17] of man when Solomon the wisest man on
[1:25:20] Earth he comes to the end of all all of
[1:25:22] this trying to understand the world and
[1:25:24] trying to make sense out of everything
[1:25:26] when he comes down to the end he said
[1:25:27] this is the conclusion of the matter
[1:25:29] fear God and keep his Commandments for
[1:25:32] this is the whole duty of
[1:25:35] man every generation has
[1:25:38] failed but there's got to be a
[1:25:40] generation so there's been Brides brides
[1:25:43] and churches churches but there's got to
[1:25:44] be one there's got to be one that'll
[1:25:46] give the headship preeminence there's
[1:25:48] got to be one that he can come down and
[1:25:50] live his own life in there's got to be
[1:25:52] one one that will surrender where the
[1:25:53] word will
[1:25:54] work one that that he gets preeminence
[1:25:59] in this is what he says in the seventh
[1:26:01] seal it's an old
[1:26:03] battle that started way back Beyond
[1:26:07] Time Satan and his angels was kicked out
[1:26:10] then they come to earth and the battle
[1:26:11] set in and again be because Eve broke
[1:26:13] down the barrier from where she was
[1:26:14] isolated behind the word of godone and
[1:26:17] from that very hour Satan won the battle
[1:26:20] over God's word because one of subjects
[1:26:23] the weaker let down the
[1:26:25] bar Satan won the battle over the word
[1:26:28] because one subject let down the bar he
[1:26:31] says and that's exactly how he's won the
[1:26:33] battle every time has been because one
[1:26:35] of his subjects let down the bar from
[1:26:38] the
[1:26:39] word say God help me please help me not
[1:26:43] to let down the bar I've done it in the
[1:26:46] past friends I've done it in numerous
[1:26:49] ways but I'm praying God take control of
[1:26:51] this vessel because you can't have we
[1:26:55] can't keep letting down the bar on the
[1:26:57] word it keeps giving Satan victory over
[1:26:59] the word but this word is going to win
[1:27:01] today this word that's been delivered
[1:27:04] this word that's been restored it will
[1:27:05] defeat the Devil in every way but it
[1:27:07] needs a vessel to work through and I
[1:27:09] just want to stand here and yield my
[1:27:11] vessel for him to work through and say
[1:27:13] God I want a greater surrender than I've
[1:27:15] ever had before but I need your help
[1:27:18] amen again back in Christ is a mystery
[1:27:20] he says and in there there would be a
[1:27:22] Time come forth when he would Express
[1:27:24] himself in fullness of his godhead deity
[1:27:28] through his
[1:27:29] church have the preeminence in his
[1:27:32] church oh my what the anointed man now
[1:27:36] the anointed people oh my to bring back
[1:27:38] the anointed bride and the bridegroom
[1:27:40] anointed by why accepting what Eve
[1:27:43] turned down what did Eve turned down the
[1:27:48] word obedience to the word she exchanged
[1:27:51] that for
[1:27:53] wisdom we're here to exchange wisdom
[1:27:56] back for the word we're here to reverse
[1:27:59] what was done to lay down our own
[1:28:01] thinking and give up wisdom and come
[1:28:03] back to the word
[1:28:05] amen amen bring back the anointed bride
[1:28:08] and bridegroom anointed by why accepting
[1:28:10] what Eve turned down in Adam coming back
[1:28:12] with the anointing of the word because
[1:28:14] he said my word is spirit see Anointed
[1:28:17] with the word what Eve turned down he
[1:28:20] comes back and we ac accept amen oh I
[1:28:23] thank God that he's come back and he's
[1:28:26] put something in our heart to accept it
[1:28:29] amen this is the final verse I'd like to
[1:28:31] read together if we go to First Timothy
[1:28:34] together first
[1:28:47] Timothy 1
[1:28:49] Timothy chapter 1
[1:28:59] 1 Timothy chapter 1 verse 5 now the end
[1:29:03] of the Commandment is do you want to
[1:29:06] know what the end of it all
[1:29:08] is Charity which is love out of a pure
[1:29:13] heart and of a good conscience and a
[1:29:16] faith
[1:29:17] unfeigned what's the end of the whole
[1:29:20] matter just love
[1:29:23] God out of a pure heart not with selfish
[1:29:27] motives not with our own scientific
[1:29:29] ideas not with manipul Just
[1:29:33] Surrender out of a pure heart
[1:29:36] amen and a and a good
[1:29:40] conscience and Faith unfeigned what has
[1:29:44] God been trying to get he's been trying
[1:29:45] to get this all
[1:29:47] along what does he want he just wants
[1:29:50] somebody that'll listen Len to his
[1:29:53] voice I'm so glad I believe with all my
[1:29:56] heart he's called me to be that somebody
[1:29:58] I'm not worthy of it I'm also not very
[1:30:00] good at it but by the grace of God I
[1:30:02] believe he has called me to be one of
[1:30:05] those that will hear his voice in the
[1:30:06] end time and he's called me to be one of
[1:30:09] those that he gets preeminence in I
[1:30:11] believe that if I didn't believe that I
[1:30:12] would give up and I'd run home and I'd
[1:30:14] crawl under the sheets and ask God to
[1:30:16] take me now but I believe that he's
[1:30:17] going to get preeminence in me and I
[1:30:20] know he needs more room
[1:30:22] yeah I can confess that today I need to
[1:30:24] give him more space more room I need to
[1:30:27] die a little more there's still too much
[1:30:30] pride there's still too much
[1:30:31] self-preservation in me there's still
[1:30:33] too much of my own thinking but I
[1:30:35] believe with all my heart that I'm
[1:30:37] living in the day when when he's going
[1:30:39] to get the preeminence in a body of
[1:30:41] Believers and I believe he's doing it
[1:30:43] now by degrees because I can look back
[1:30:45] and say I'm not what I I may not be what
[1:30:48] I ought to be but I'm not what I used to
[1:30:50] be amen and I know that God's word has
[1:30:53] had greater prence than me and he's
[1:30:54] brought me into a greater place than
[1:30:57] I've ever been before he's brought me
[1:30:59] into a greater freedom than I've ever
[1:31:01] known he's brought me into greater
[1:31:02] blessings than I've ever had and I'm not
[1:31:04] talking just the financial just the
[1:31:06] natural things I have that too by the
[1:31:08] grace of God with my family with health
[1:31:10] with all the things that God's blessed
[1:31:11] us but that's not the freedom I'm
[1:31:13] talking about there's a freedom in my
[1:31:15] soul that I have come to a level that
[1:31:17] I've never been at before amen but I
[1:31:20] don't believe he's done yeah
[1:31:22] I want him to have more I want him to
[1:31:25] have more of me I want him to have more
[1:31:27] preeminence in me I want the word to be
[1:31:29] my headship in every area of my life I
[1:31:32] want to throw open the doors within the
[1:31:34] doors within the
[1:31:35] doors and say you're welcome here you're
[1:31:39] welcome in every part of my life in
[1:31:40] every chamber of my heart you're welcome
[1:31:42] in my thoughts and come and let that
[1:31:44] word wash everything else out and let me
[1:31:47] God give me the strength give me the
[1:31:49] courage give me whatever I need the
[1:31:50] faith whatever I need just give me the
[1:31:53] the elements I need just to obey like a
[1:31:58] child why Jesus gathered he gathered the
[1:32:01] little children unto him and when they
[1:32:03] were disputing on who's the greatest
[1:32:04] who's that he brought a little child in
[1:32:06] the midst of them and he stood that
[1:32:07] child he said in the midst of them said
[1:32:10] unless you repent and become like one of
[1:32:14] them should not even see the Kingdom of
[1:32:20] Heaven I don't I want to be a
[1:32:22] scientist I want to be a child amen I
[1:32:26] don't want to be the smartest one I
[1:32:28] don't want to be the one that's got all
[1:32:29] figured out what I want to be is one
[1:32:32] that can humbly submit to the voice of
[1:32:34] God to surrender to the word in every
[1:32:37] are of my life because if I can do that
[1:32:40] I will become what God has been looking
[1:32:42] for all
[1:32:43] along what was lost in Eden is being
[1:32:46] restored right now am and I believe I'm
[1:32:50] looking at the people that he's using to
[1:32:51] restore it am I believe that we may we
[1:32:55] may have messed up today and yesterday
[1:32:58] and maybe mess up tomorrow but I still
[1:33:01] believe that's true I can't help but
[1:33:03] believe it amen I see where we've come
[1:33:06] from I see what God's done Among Us and
[1:33:07] I've seen what the word is doing all
[1:33:09] around us and I can't help but believe
[1:33:12] that I'm standing amongst the people
