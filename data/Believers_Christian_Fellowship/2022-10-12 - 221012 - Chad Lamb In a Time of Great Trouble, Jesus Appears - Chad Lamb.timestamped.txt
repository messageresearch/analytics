[15:44] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen
[15:48] God bless you while we're standing let's
[15:49] turn to the Book of Psalms together
[15:53] I'll begin reading there
[15:55] man I want to as you're turning I want
[15:57] to remind everybody that this Sunday
[15:58] brother Joseph Scott and I will be
[16:00] heading to India to visit brother Roshan
[16:02] so we appreciate you praying for us also
[16:05] that'll be Sunday evening we're leaving
[16:07] we'll be here in the morning I I tend to
[16:09] preach the Sunday morning service this
[16:10] Sunday and then Sunday night we'll be
[16:12] flying out but Sunday morning brother
[16:14] Emmanuel and sister Mimi it's a boss who
[16:17] are traveling over to the Democratic
[16:18] Republic of Congo to do some work for
[16:21] some Churches there so we want to be
[16:22] praying for them as well and they'll be
[16:24] gone almost the exact same time we will
[16:26] so we'll be praying for each other won't
[16:28] we brother Emmanuel amen
[16:30] amen let's turn to Psalms 37 and begin
[16:33] reading there
[16:43] Psalms 37 I'm going to read two verses
[16:46] verse 39 and verse 40.
[16:49] but the salvation of the righteous is of
[16:52] the Lord he is their strength in the
[16:54] time of trouble and the Lord shall help
[16:57] them and deliver them he shall deliver
[16:58] them from the wicked and save them
[17:01] because they trust in him amen God bless
[17:05] you as you're seated
[17:07] I I love this he is their strength in
[17:11] the time of trouble
[17:13] and the Lord shall help them and deliver
[17:15] them he shall deliver them from the
[17:16] wicked and save them because they trust
[17:19] in him
[17:20] and and if if we want the Lord to
[17:23] deliver us then we need to stop
[17:26] delivering ourselves and just trust in
[17:28] him amen we need to start trying we need
[17:31] to stop uh uh um over protecting
[17:34] analyzing trying to figure out amen all
[17:38] of these things we just need to trust in
[17:39] him and if we trust in him he will
[17:42] protect us amen he is our strength in
[17:44] the time of trouble and he will save us
[17:46] because we trust in him so we need to do
[17:48] is trust in him
[17:51] amen there's a a quote out of the church
[17:54] age book from the Philadelphian Church
[17:55] days that says it is in the midst of a
[17:58] time of great trouble that Jesus comes
[18:00] and with his coming there is a
[18:02] resurrection many are to come forth Out
[18:04] of the Dust and rise with those who are
[18:06] alive but waiting for his return so we
[18:08] know the context of the statement I read
[18:10] a little more to get the context of the
[18:12] statement but I just wouldn't take for a
[18:14] title uh this evening in a time of great
[18:17] trouble Jesus comes
[18:19] and many of us have experienced this in
[18:21] our lives God showing up on the scene in
[18:23] a time of great trouble amen he's
[18:25] promised to do this for us and he is our
[18:28] strength in a time of trouble and it is
[18:30] in the midst of a time of great trouble
[18:31] that Jesus comes
[18:33] and let's turn the book of Hebrews and
[18:36] we're going to grab a couple more
[18:37] scriptures here Hebrews and we'll go
[18:39] back to Psalms
[18:40] Hebrews chapter 13.
[18:47] Hebrews 13.
[18:53] 5.
[18:55] Hebrews 13 and 5. let your conversation
[18:57] be without covetousness and be content
[19:00] with such things as you have for he hath
[19:02] said I will never leave thee nor forsake
[19:05] thee so that we may boldly say the Lord
[19:07] is my helper I will not fear what man
[19:10] shall do unto me
[19:12] amen he has promised to never leave us
[19:15] or forsake us so we can trust in him
[19:17] because his word will never fail and if
[19:19] he made it as a promise that promise
[19:21] will stand forever he will never leave
[19:24] us and he will never forsake us so that
[19:26] we can boldly say the Lord is my helper
[19:29] I don't need any other helper I'm not
[19:31] looking the government I'm not looking
[19:33] to savings I'm not looking I mean I'm
[19:35] not looking to anything else the Lord is
[19:37] my helper because he promised he'll
[19:39] never leave me nor forsake me and that
[19:41] promise gives me the boldness to say the
[19:44] Lord is my helper and I will not fear
[19:47] what man shall do to me
[19:49] Amanda we need not fear what any other
[19:53] human being can do because God has
[19:55] promised that he would take care of us
[19:57] let's go back to the book of Psalm and
[19:59] read Psalm chapter 3 together
[20:07] and we're going to read the entirety of
[20:09] Psalm chapter 3.
[20:15] Psalm 3 and 1 says Lord how are they
[20:18] increased that troubled me many are they
[20:21] that rise up against me many there be
[20:23] which say of my soul there is no help
[20:25] for him and God see love but thou O Lord
[20:28] are a shield for me my glory and the
[20:31] lifter up of mine head
[20:33] I Cried unto the Lord with my voice and
[20:36] he heard me out of his holy hills
[20:38] I laid me down and slept I awakened for
[20:42] the Lord sustained me I will not be
[20:44] afraid of ten thousands of people that
[20:46] have set themselves against me round
[20:48] about arise oh Lord Save Me O my God for
[20:52] thou has smitten all my enemies upon the
[20:54] cheekbone thou has broken the teeth of
[20:56] the ungodly salvation belongeth unto the
[20:59] Lord thy blessing is upon thy people
[21:03] amen you know this is a Psalm of David
[21:06] that he wrote when Absalom rebelled
[21:08] against amen and for David this was a
[21:10] physical need for physical salvation and
[21:13] but many times what was physical for the
[21:15] Jews is spiritual for us and we're
[21:17] compassed about by demon forces by
[21:20] demonic forces by evil spirits that are
[21:22] constantly trying to derail us or
[21:24] overcome us Amen in many ways but God
[21:27] has promised to be our shield and our
[21:29] buckler he's the one who takes care of
[21:31] us we can lay down and sleep and raise
[21:34] up for he has sustained us amen we don't
[21:37] have to keep ourselves and and you know
[21:40] this is there's so many spiritual
[21:42] battles going on around us around us
[21:44] that we cannot fight in a physical way
[21:46] amen so we become when it comes to the
[21:49] physical elements we become so helpless
[21:51] to fight these battles we need a God who
[21:54] can fight for us and a God who can
[21:56] sustain us amen
[21:58] and so he has promised that he will be
[22:02] around us surrounding us watching over
[22:04] us and we can trust in him so I will not
[22:07] be afraid of ten thousands of people
[22:11] there's so many scriptures that tell us
[22:13] to not be afraid amen Don't Be Afraid
[22:16] let your heart and be not troubled don't
[22:19] be afraid and and we need to take these
[22:22] to heart because if God is our helper he
[22:24] is our helper amen if he's ever been our
[22:27] helper he'll always be our helper if
[22:28] we're his child and we're in his in his
[22:31] kingdom and part of his plan he's
[22:32] promised to watch over us we're in his
[22:35] Strong Tower amen he is our shield and
[22:37] our buckler he is the lifter of our head
[22:39] he is our Salvation he is our strength
[22:42] he is our Defender he is our all in all
[22:44] amen and we can rest in him and trust
[22:47] that we don't have to fear medical
[22:49] diagnosis we don't have to fear
[22:51] economies we don't have to fear Wars we
[22:54] don't have to fear any of the situations
[22:56] that we're facing we don't have to fear
[22:58] because God has made a promise to his
[23:01] people
[23:01] [Music]
[23:03] and in the time of great trouble Jesus
[23:06] comes
[23:07] let's go look in the Book of Daniel
[23:09] together
[23:12] we're going to look at two stories that
[23:13] are so very familiar
[23:15] to us but I want to look at them in this
[23:17] context
[23:19] Daniel chapter 3.
[23:22] and verse 23.
[23:24] Daniel Daniel chapter 3
[23:27] and verse 23.
[23:33] and these three men Shadrach Meshach and
[23:35] Abednego fell down bound into the midst
[23:38] of the burning fiery furnace
[23:40] so we all from that context know the
[23:43] story so well they refused to bow to the
[23:45] image that the king had erected and then
[23:47] refusing they knew they would face death
[23:49] and and they were told they were given
[23:52] an opportunity to Bow and they could go
[23:55] free but they refused before the king
[23:57] and the King warned them that you'll be
[23:59] cast into the furnace and they said our
[24:01] God is able to deliver us but even if he
[24:04] doesn't
[24:04] Will Not Bow Down and now they're cast
[24:07] into the fiery furnace verse 24 then
[24:10] Kevin Nebuchadnezzar the King was
[24:12] astonied and Rose up in haste and spake
[24:15] and said unto his counselors did not we
[24:17] cast three men bound into the midst of
[24:19] the fire they answered and said unto him
[24:21] unto the king true O King he answered
[24:24] and said lo I see four men loose walking
[24:27] in the midst of the fire and they have
[24:29] no hurt and the form of the fourth is
[24:31] like the son of God
[24:33] in a time of great trouble Jesus comes
[24:37] and a time of great trouble he makes his
[24:39] appearance amen he shows that he's
[24:42] present amen I I I don't believe that
[24:45] that was the first time and amen that
[24:47] that the Son of God was in their midst
[24:49] that's when he made himself known that's
[24:51] when he appeared amen he was with them
[24:53] up the ramp he was with them all the way
[24:55] he was with him when they denied the
[24:56] king amen but but he made his appearance
[24:59] and the King saw it amen let's go to
[25:01] verse 28.
[25:05] then Nebuchadnezzar spake and said
[25:07] blessed be the god of Shadrach Meshach
[25:09] and Abednego who has sent his Angel and
[25:12] delivered his servants that trusted in
[25:14] him and have changed the king's words
[25:16] and yielded their bodies that they may
[25:17] not serve nor worship any God except
[25:19] their own God
[25:21] they didn't need to save themselves
[25:23] because God would send his Angel amen so
[25:25] the angel of the Lord amen is the Lord
[25:28] amen and the angel Lord came on the
[25:30] scene and he saw the fourth man amen as
[25:33] the Son of God and a time of great
[25:35] trouble Jesus came
[25:38] let's go on to uh chapter 6 now
[25:41] and look at Daniel
[25:46] in similar fashion Daniel was tested
[25:48] because he had prayed to the Lord three
[25:50] times a day and and you know through
[25:52] through accountingly devised plan the
[25:55] other wise men and the princes convinced
[25:58] the king to make a law against praying
[25:59] to any other God but he himself and he
[26:02] fell for the trick and he made the law
[26:04] and Daniel got caught in the Trap and he
[26:07] was going to be thrown into the lion's
[26:08] den and he was thrown alive into the
[26:11] lion's den and the King came back and
[26:13] the next morning and he and he hollers
[26:15] oh Daniel was your God able to save you
[26:18] and let's look at verse 21 here Daniel 6
[26:21] and 21 then said Daniel unto the king O
[26:24] King live forever
[26:27] my God hath sent his Angel and has shut
[26:31] the Lion's mouths and they have not hurt
[26:32] me for as much as before him innocency
[26:35] was found in me and also before thee O
[26:38] King have I done no hurt God has sent
[26:40] his angel in a time of great trouble
[26:42] Jesus came
[26:45] amen and so we don't have to fear
[26:48] anything
[26:51] I think we all know that we live in a
[26:54] bit of an unpredictable time
[26:56] it's things are changing and in in the
[26:59] world and it's a very unpredictable time
[27:01] and there's a lot of uncertainty and who
[27:04] knows what will happen things can go on
[27:06] as they are for a long large period of
[27:08] time they could change rapidly who knows
[27:10] what will happen but no matter what
[27:11] happens there's no reason to be afraid
[27:14] let's turn to Psalms 91.
[27:27] Psalms 91
[27:31] this Psalm blessed me immensely when we
[27:34] think of this topic in this subject
[27:35] Psalm 91 verse 1.
[27:38] he that dwelleth in the secret place of
[27:40] the most high shall abide under the
[27:42] shadow of the Almighty I will say of the
[27:46] Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my
[27:48] God and him will I trust surely he shall
[27:51] deliver thee From The Snare of the
[27:53] Fowler and from the noise and pestilence
[27:55] he shall cover thee with his feathers
[27:57] and under his wings shalt thou trust his
[27:59] truth shall be thy shield and buckler
[28:02] Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
[28:04] by night nor for the arrow that flyeth
[28:06] by day nor for the pestilence that
[28:08] walketh in darkness nor for the
[28:10] destruction that wasteth at Noonday A
[28:13] thousand shall fall at thy side and ten
[28:15] thousand at thy right hand but it shall
[28:17] not come nigh thee Only With Thine eye
[28:20] shalt thou behold and see the reward of
[28:22] the wicked because thou has made the
[28:25] Lord which is my refuge even the most
[28:27] high thy habitation there shall no evil
[28:30] befall thee neither shall any plague
[28:32] come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give
[28:35] his angels charge over thee to keep thee
[28:37] in all the way thy ways they shall bear
[28:40] thee up in their hands lest thou Dash
[28:42] thy foot against the stone Thou shalt
[28:44] tread upon the lion and the adder the
[28:46] Young Lion and the dragon shalt thou
[28:48] trample under feet because he hath set
[28:50] his love upon me therefore will I
[28:53] deliver him I will set him on high
[28:55] because he hath known my name he shall
[28:58] call upon me and I will answer him I
[29:00] will be with him in trouble I will
[29:02] deliver him and honor him with long life
[29:05] will I satisfy him and show him my
[29:08] salvation
[29:10] I love that verse 15 I will be with him
[29:12] in time of trouble
[29:14] with him in trouble in time of great
[29:17] trouble we don't have to worry
[29:19] he is here
[29:23] when we look at this
[29:25] Psalm 91 there's a promise in here and
[29:29] and it looks as if nothing bad will ever
[29:33] happen
[29:34] no sickness no harm no hurt but yet all
[29:38] through the lives of Christians there's
[29:40] been sickness there's been there's been
[29:42] physical injury there's been all this
[29:44] other things but I'd like to point out
[29:47] that nothing will hurt you
[29:50] no matter what happens it won't hurt you
[29:52] sickness won't hurt you injury won't
[29:54] hurt you amen troubles won't hurt you
[29:57] amen family troubles won't hurt you
[29:59] political troubles won't hurt you amen
[30:01] nothing will hurt you when you realize
[30:04] what you is
[30:06] I don't know if that's good grammar or
[30:08] not but when you realize what you is
[30:10] you'll know that nothing will hurt you
[30:12] amen sickness can't hurt you nothing can
[30:15] hurt you when you realize what you
[30:17] really are who you really are and what
[30:19] is the real part of you amen
[30:22] let's go and look at Luke chapter 10.
[30:31] we find as we mature in Christ we have
[30:33] to stop thinking carnally
[30:35] and begin to think spiritually
[30:38] Luke chapter 10 verse 19.
[30:45] Jesus now speaking to the disciples
[30:47] after they've come back from the
[30:49] campaign he sent him on two by two into
[30:50] the cities and they cast out Devils
[30:53] healed the sick and they come and
[30:54] brought him a report and in verse 19 he
[30:56] says behold I give you power to tread on
[30:59] serpents and scorpions and over all the
[31:00] power of the enemy and nothing shall by
[31:03] any means hurt you
[31:05] amen nothing shall by any means hurt you
[31:09] amen some of the people he was speaking
[31:12] to would be stoned to death
[31:14] some of them would have their heads cut
[31:15] off
[31:16] John would be boiled in oil trying to
[31:19] kill him
[31:20] so there was many things that would
[31:22] happen Amen to the to the fleshly bodies
[31:26] of the individuals he was speaking to
[31:28] but the statement remains true amen
[31:31] nothing shall by any means hurt you
[31:36] brother Brown says in the message Shalom
[31:38] like in the physical body as we are now
[31:41] we are separated from one another but it
[31:43] is really this body is the only thing
[31:45] that identifies us to each other because
[31:48] we are bound in five senses see tastes
[31:50] feel smell here and as long as we can
[31:52] see or feel one another why we have
[31:55] evidence that we're here
[31:57] if you're blind and can't see then you
[31:59] can feel one another or hear one another
[32:01] and the Earthly senses declare one
[32:03] another but really frankly we have never
[32:06] seen each other
[32:09] did you know that so let me take this to
[32:11] heart we have never actually seen each
[32:14] other we have seen a physical
[32:16] representation of one another but we
[32:18] have never actually seen one another
[32:22] did you know that we have never seen one
[32:24] another you hear something speaking out
[32:26] of a body here that impersonates
[32:29] whatever's on the inside
[32:33] so then when we talk to each other we're
[32:36] really not talking to the body it's the
[32:38] spirit inside but the body is the thing
[32:41] that identifies the spirit that's on the
[32:43] inside and therefore when we speak to
[32:45] each other we quickly can understand
[32:47] right away whether we're Christians or
[32:49] not because there's a fellowship in the
[32:51] spirit that we talk from you see that it
[32:53] vibrates to one another that whether we
[32:55] are Christians or not therefore we have
[32:58] never seen each other
[33:01] that's how Jesus can look at the
[33:03] disciples and say nothing by any means
[33:05] shall hurt you
[33:07] because the you is not this you amen
[33:11] something can hurt this part this part
[33:13] is not me this is a tabernacle I dwell
[33:16] in and this flesh reflects me but the
[33:18] real me is the spirit me on the inside
[33:21] the Son of God the child of God Amen and
[33:25] so we we have a flesh that declares one
[33:27] another but it's not me so no matter
[33:29] what happens to the flesh nothing can
[33:32] hurt me
[33:34] we have to understand this because it
[33:37] becomes so imperative to understand the
[33:40] the protection of God and the promises
[33:42] of God Amen God will deliver this flesh
[33:45] over and over and over again because
[33:47] it's serving his purpose amen because we
[33:50] have to have a life that reflects his
[33:52] life upon this Earth and in order to
[33:54] manifest that light that life we have to
[33:56] have a body to work in and he made
[33:58] promises for us even for healing and
[34:01] physical Deliverance so that we have a
[34:02] body to work out of but this body is not
[34:05] me I am inside of this body amen
[34:09] so what happens to the body
[34:11] I mean can't hurt me
[34:14] and I've I've realized recently that my
[34:17] body doesn't work as well as it used to
[34:19] and brother Benham talked about amen
[34:21] when he when he when he crossed 50 he
[34:23] got up in the morning and he was stiff
[34:25] and had aches and pains and he talked
[34:27] about all of that but but I I used to
[34:30] hear what brother Branham said but I
[34:31] didn't know what he was talking about
[34:34] and then you begin to realize that your
[34:37] body begins to stiffen up involuntarily
[34:40] I don't want it to be stiff
[34:42] it just happens
[34:44] and the body ages and brother bear said
[34:46] we've got to go through some of these
[34:48] things but really on the inside I have
[34:52] never changed amen I'm the same that
[34:55] I've always been I feel the same I think
[34:57] the same I have the same thoughts and
[34:59] desires and amen it's the outside that's
[35:02] changing but the inside is growing more
[35:04] like Christ the outside is deteriorating
[35:07] but the inside is not amen
[35:11] so we need to focus on the part that
[35:14] matters most
[35:16] let's turn to the book of Acts
[35:19] chapter 7.
[35:21] Acts chapter 7 records the first martyr
[35:24] the first Christian martyr which is
[35:25] Steve and a deacon in the in the first
[35:27] church and he preaches a marvelous
[35:30] sermon through Acts chapter 7 when he's
[35:32] called before the Sanhedrin and the
[35:34] elders are questioning him and he takes
[35:36] him all the way through down the history
[35:38] of their nation and Through the Bible
[35:40] and he finally ends with a condemnation
[35:42] to them amen for what they have done in
[35:45] their day
[35:46] and then I want to pick it up in verse
[35:48] 54 chapter 7 verse 54.
[35:54] it says when they heard these things
[35:56] they were cut to the heart and they
[35:58] gnashed on him with their teeth
[36:00] but he being full of the Holy Ghost
[36:02] looked up steadfastly into heaven and
[36:04] saw the glory of God and Jesus standing
[36:07] on the right hand of God
[36:09] and said behold I see the heavens open
[36:11] and the son of man standing on the right
[36:13] hand of God then they cried out with a
[36:16] loud voice and stopped their ears and
[36:18] ran upon him with one Accord and cast
[36:21] him out of the city and stoned him and
[36:23] the witnesses laid down their clothes at
[36:25] a young man's feet whose name was Saul
[36:27] and they stoned Stephen calling upon God
[36:30] and saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit
[36:32] and he kneeled down and he cried with a
[36:35] loud voice Lord lay not this sin to
[36:38] their charge and when he had said this
[36:40] he fell asleep
[36:42] there's several interesting things that
[36:44] I want to point out here first is that
[36:46] he fell asleep Stephen didn't die
[36:48] because Stephen couldn't die
[36:50] it was impossible for him to die amen
[36:53] because he was a child of God he had
[36:54] within him eternal life he could not die
[36:57] but what he could do was fall asleep
[36:59] amen this is why Jesus At The Lazarus
[37:01] death he told his disciples Lazarus
[37:03] sleepeth and they thought if he sleepeth
[37:05] he'd do it well and brother bam said he
[37:07] had to speak in terms they would
[37:08] understand he had to change their
[37:10] language he said Lazarus is dead amen
[37:13] but Lazarus wasn't dead the body Lazarus
[37:15] lived in was dead they understood him to
[37:18] be dead Jesus understood him to be
[37:20] asleep
[37:22] and now Stephen amen being stoned to
[37:24] death amen being stoned to death he
[37:28] could not die he fell asleep but he
[37:31] could not die
[37:33] so when he was in a time of great
[37:35] trouble
[37:37] he saw Jesus
[37:40] because in a time of great trouble Jesus
[37:42] comes and he looked up and and as they
[37:45] were running upon him to to kill him
[37:47] that they were gnashing upon him with
[37:49] their teeth and they were angry and he
[37:51] looked up steadfastly he saw the heavens
[37:53] open and he saw Jesus standing on the
[37:55] right hand of God and and in his time of
[37:58] trouble he saw the Lord amen the Lord
[38:01] appeared unto him but not to everybody
[38:04] else
[38:05] he was the only one amen who caught the
[38:08] vision he was the only one who saw amen
[38:10] what was going on but when they drug him
[38:13] out of the city and began to Stone him
[38:16] amen Stephen it says here
[38:19] in verse 59 and they stoned Stephen
[38:22] calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus
[38:24] received my spirit and he dealed down
[38:26] and cried with a loud voice Lord lay not
[38:29] this sin to their charge and when he had
[38:32] said this he fell asleep
[38:36] when it come to a time of trouble for
[38:38] Stephen the Lord appeared
[38:41] but Stephen was the only one who could
[38:45] see
[38:46] the rest couldn't see
[38:49] but when Stephen said Lord
[38:53] lay not this sin to their charge
[38:57] he was manifesting the Lord Jesus that
[39:00] appeared to him
[39:02] he was demonstrating to them or
[39:04] manifesting to them the very same life
[39:07] that was hanging on Calvary just a short
[39:09] time before that said father forgive
[39:12] them for they don't know what they're
[39:13] doing when he was laughed at when he was
[39:15] mocked when his beard was ripped out of
[39:17] his face when he was beaten and hung on
[39:19] a cross and they were walking by mocking
[39:21] him he said Lord forgive them for they
[39:24] don't know what they're doing now his
[39:27] life is in Stephen Stephen in a time of
[39:29] trouble the Lord appears to him but then
[39:31] what he does is he manifests the very
[39:34] presence of Jesus Christ in his flesh by
[39:37] saying father lay not this sin to their
[39:39] charge and they all missed it amen they
[39:42] missed what was going on in their midst
[39:44] he was there manifesting the life of the
[39:46] Lord Jesus Christ and they didn't see it
[39:51] in a time of trouble
[39:53] he was there
[39:55] in a time of trouble he was made
[39:57] manifest
[39:59] in a time of trouble he was on display
[40:03] but they couldn't see who it was that
[40:06] was in Stephen all they could see was
[40:09] the flesh body but he was manifesting
[40:12] the life of Jesus Christ
[40:14] that was Christ in Stephen
[40:17] that was forgiving those people
[40:22] and the message who is this from 1959
[40:24] the prophet said but there are some who
[40:26] believe on him they were expecting him
[40:28] to come and knowing that something
[40:30] special would be there something was
[40:32] going to take place for Jesus cannot
[40:34] come at any time unless something
[40:35] special does take place
[40:37] there's always something new when he
[40:39] appears and they were charged with
[40:40] expectations but the bad thing about all
[40:43] this there was many who did not see him
[40:46] never to get to see him when he come
[40:49] and that's one of the sad things about
[40:51] today there'll be many who won't see him
[40:54] when he comes
[40:56] but there'll be a Remnant there'll be
[40:58] those who know God and who are waiting
[41:00] and who are charged they'll see him for
[41:02] he will come as a thief in the night
[41:04] we'll be caught up to meet the Lord in
[41:05] the air a secret going away of the
[41:07] church
[41:08] when Jesus come they were there was an
[41:11] expectation that there would be a
[41:13] messiah there was a prophecy laying
[41:16] there they were expecting but when he
[41:18] come many didn't see him
[41:21] some that looked right at him didn't see
[41:24] him
[41:25] some that spoke with him didn't seem
[41:28] talked to him didn't see him saw the
[41:30] Miracles but didn't see him
[41:32] they were looking for a messiah but when
[41:35] he come they missed him but he came
[41:38] he was in their midst he was declaring
[41:40] himself he was doing the works that the
[41:42] father gave him to do he was doing the
[41:44] works that testified of who he was amen
[41:47] they saw amen a form but they didn't see
[41:50] who it was amen they saw Jesus but they
[41:53] didn't know that this was the Messiah
[41:55] they missed him when he came even when
[41:57] they saw him just like they missed him
[41:59] and Stephen when Stephen forgave them
[42:02] man
[42:03] and he says when he comes today many
[42:06] won't see him and that's the case many
[42:08] don't see him although he's present and
[42:11] he declares himself
[42:14] let's go to Matthew chapter 13.
[42:24] Matthew chapter 13.
[42:29] in verse 13.
[42:34] he says therefore I speak unto them in
[42:36] Parables because they sing see not and
[42:39] hearing they hear not neither do they
[42:41] understand and in them is fulfilled the
[42:44] prophecy of isaiahs which saith by
[42:46] hearing ye shall hear and shall not
[42:48] understand and seeing ye shall see and
[42:50] shall not perceive
[42:52] for this people's heart is wax gross and
[42:55] their ears are dull of hearing and their
[42:57] eyes they have closed us at any time
[42:59] they should see with their eyes and hear
[43:00] with their ears and should understand
[43:02] with their heart and should be converted
[43:04] and I should heal them
[43:06] but blessed are your eyes for they see
[43:08] in your ears for they hear
[43:11] [Music]
[43:13] he was present
[43:15] he had come
[43:17] he was in their midst
[43:19] they had been looking for him but they
[43:21] didn't see him
[43:23] they didn't seem when he come although
[43:25] he came according to the word according
[43:28] to the promise I'll go on time he came
[43:30] but they didn't see him but he said
[43:31] blessed are your eyes because you see in
[43:33] your ears because you're here just
[43:35] because some didn't see didn't mean he
[43:37] didn't come amen and just because some
[43:39] couldn't see that mean others couldn't
[43:40] see some saw some didn't see but it was
[43:43] the same event amen
[43:47] it goes to show that he can come and it
[43:49] be missed
[43:52] in Hebrews chapter 5 and 6 from the
[43:56] Hebrew series Prophet said friends let's
[43:58] go on into perfection
[44:00] we're without excuse today we have no
[44:02] excuse at all the god of Heaven has
[44:04] appeared in these last days and is doing
[44:06] the very same thing that he did when he
[44:08] was here before when he was on Earth he
[44:11] has proved as we're coming through this
[44:13] Bible
[44:14] again he says and when their eyes were
[44:15] opened they knew him he said still you
[44:18] know today after that Jesus has raised
[44:20] from the dead and has appeared to the
[44:22] people in the last days I say again
[44:25] Jesus has appeared amen
[44:27] amen he has appeared in the last days
[44:29] through a prophetic Ministry amen they
[44:32] saw the prophetic Ministry but they
[44:34] didn't see the Lord Jesus Christ
[44:36] they didn't see who it was behind the
[44:38] flash they didn't see who it was during
[44:40] the discernment they didn't see who it
[44:42] was working the Miracles amen they saw
[44:45] they saw the body of flesh but they
[44:47] missed the appearing of Jesus Christ
[44:51] and so it goes to show he can appear and
[44:53] it can be missed he can come and it can
[44:55] be missed
[44:58] go to Revelation chapter one I want to
[45:01] drop this little thought in here of the
[45:02] Prophet I want to bring this in
[45:04] hopefully for clarity I hope it brings
[45:06] clarity
[45:08] Revelation chapter 1
[45:17] Revelation chapter 1.
[45:20] verse 7.
[45:22] it says behold he cometh with clouds and
[45:25] every eye shall see him and they also
[45:28] which Pierce him and all kinds of the
[45:29] Earth shall wail because of him even so
[45:32] amen
[45:34] so this is the coming of the Lord
[45:36] do we all agree
[45:37] [Music]
[45:39] amen he cometh with clouds and every eye
[45:41] shall see him
[45:42] they also which pierced him
[45:45] and then in the church age book and the
[45:48] section the revelation of Jesus Christ
[45:49] he reads this scripture and after he
[45:52] refers to that scripture he says he is
[45:54] coming Jesus is coming God is coming the
[45:57] prophet is coming the priest and King is
[45:58] Coming the all in all is coming even so
[46:01] Lord Jesus come quickly amen he is
[46:04] coming he is coming in clouds Clouds Of
[46:06] Glory is when he was seen upon the mount
[46:08] Transfiguration and his garments were
[46:11] shining as the power of God unfolding
[46:12] him and every and in the church age book
[46:15] that every is capitalized e-v-e-r-y all
[46:18] capitalize and every eye shall see him
[46:20] that means this is not the rapture
[46:25] so in the coming for the Rapture not
[46:28] everybody will see him he will come but
[46:31] many will miss him but blessed are your
[46:33] eyes for they see and your ears for they
[46:35] hear he will come for the Rapture of the
[46:38] church but not every eye will see him
[46:40] this is a different coming of the Lord
[46:42] amen so every time you hear the coming
[46:44] of the lord it's not the same coming
[46:46] amen
[46:47] and every eye shall see him that means
[46:49] this is not the Rapture this is when he
[46:52] comes to take over his rightful places
[46:54] World ruler this is when those who have
[46:56] pierced him with their Creeds and
[46:58] denominational Doctrine shall mourn and
[47:00] all the people shall wail and Terror
[47:02] because of him who is the word
[47:05] so
[47:06] he
[47:09] when he comes that time
[47:11] every eye shall see him
[47:13] but that's not the rapture
[47:15] when he comes for the rapture
[47:18] only a few
[47:20] he will come
[47:22] but only a few will see him
[47:27] in the message God has provided away
[47:29] from 1962 he said now remember these two
[47:31] words before I leave you the appearing
[47:33] of Christ in the coming of Christ it's
[47:35] two different things Christ is now
[47:36] appearing in the fullness of his power
[47:39] his coming will be afterwards his
[47:40] appearing before his coming God be
[47:42] merciful and brother M said his ministry
[47:45] was the he said Jesus Christ is
[47:48] appearing in the fullness of his power
[47:51] you believe he was appearing
[47:53] how many people saw Jesus
[47:55] I did
[47:57] amen I did some people saw a man from
[48:01] Kentucky with a seventh grade education
[48:03] about five foot six and wearing a
[48:05] certain colored suit and standing a
[48:07] certain way amen but there are some who
[48:09] saw beyond that and saw Jesus Christ it
[48:11] was the appearing of the Lord it was the
[48:13] appearing of Jesus Christ
[48:15] and brother rep said there was appearing
[48:17] before the coming
[48:18] this is so interesting to me when he
[48:21] comes to proving his word now we've read
[48:24] this so many times but it it's worth
[48:26] repeating so as it was in the days of
[48:28] Sodom now watch close in the days of
[48:31] Sodom so will it be at the coming of the
[48:33] son of man
[48:34] when the son of man is being revealed
[48:36] not no more as a church he know no more
[48:38] the bride is called see in that day the
[48:41] son of man will be revealed what to join
[48:43] the church through the head unite the
[48:45] marriage of the Bride the bridegroom
[48:47] call will come right through this when
[48:49] the son of man will come down and come
[48:52] in human flesh to unite the two together
[48:54] the church has to be the word he is the
[48:57] word and the two unite together and to
[48:59] do that it'll take the manifestation of
[49:01] the revealing of the son of man not a
[49:04] clergyman do you see what I mean it's
[49:07] son of man Jesus Christ will come down
[49:09] in human flesh Among Us and will make
[49:11] his word so real that it'll unite the
[49:14] church in him as one the bride and then
[49:17] shall go home to the wedding supper see
[49:19] amen she's already United see we go to
[49:21] the wedding supper not to the marriage
[49:24] he goes on to say when the word here
[49:26] unites with the person and they too
[49:28] become one and then what does it do then
[49:30] it manifests the son of man again not
[49:34] the church theologians the son of man
[49:36] the word and the church becomes one
[49:38] whatever the son of man done he was the
[49:41] word the church does the same thing
[49:45] so interesting that brother man types so
[49:48] much his ministry was the appearing of
[49:49] Jesus Christ but we know that the coming
[49:52] of the Lord was the coming of the word
[49:54] was the coming of the Capstone The
[49:55] Headstone coming to unite with the bride
[49:57] and then the ministry of the appearing
[49:59] amen was the revealing of the son of man
[50:01] and it was the coming of the son of man
[50:03] coming to what to unite with the bride
[50:06] amen and he's coming to come he's coming
[50:09] to Oneness with his bride amen so that
[50:11] the coming will be manifest in the bride
[50:15] nine
[50:16] amen amen praise be to God
[50:18] and who will see it
[50:21] multitudes will see the manifestation of
[50:25] it but who will recognize who's here
[50:30] and the message who is this Melchizedek
[50:32] the prophet says in being that I've told
[50:34] you all these things all these nights
[50:36] and tonight that he is not dead he is
[50:38] here and promised to do the same thing
[50:40] and promise that there would come a time
[50:42] and the last days according to Malachi 4
[50:44] and according to Saint Luke that he
[50:47] would appear again in human form among
[50:49] his people and do the same things and
[50:51] reveal the same things the same
[50:53] Messianic sign
[50:56] hey the world was in a time of trouble
[51:00] when the prophet of God here it was in
[51:02] religious trouble amen it was the
[51:05] darkest that it's ever been amen and in
[51:07] the time of trouble Jesus Christ
[51:09] appeared amen he appeared in profit form
[51:12] amen he appeared and Son of Man form
[51:15] amen and that was a forerunner to his
[51:18] coming amen
[51:22] amen and just because multitudes didn't
[51:24] see it doesn't mean it didn't happen
[51:28] and he was forerunning the coming
[51:33] I want to go back and I want to read uh
[51:35] Matthew 28. let's go back and read a
[51:38] couple scriptures here Matthew and then
[51:39] we'll look in John Matthew 28.
[51:52] Matthew 28 and verse 18.
[52:00] after his death Barrel in his
[52:02] resurrection
[52:03] and begins to speak to the disciples
[52:05] here in this final words in the Book of
[52:07] Matthew he said and Jesus came and spake
[52:10] unto them saying all power is given unto
[52:12] me in heaven and earth go you therefore
[52:14] and teach All Nations baptizing in them
[52:16] in the name of the father and of the son
[52:17] and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to
[52:20] observe all things whatsoever I have
[52:22] commanded you and lo I am with you all
[52:25] we even unto the end of the world
[52:28] he promised to be with the disciples
[52:31] to the end of the world to the
[52:34] consummation of the ages let's go to
[52:36] Luke 14.
[52:40] I'm sorry let's go to John 14. not Luke
[52:43] John chapter 14.
[52:48] and I want to start reading it verse 15.
[52:52] John 14 and verse 15. if you love me
[52:55] keep my Commandments and I will pray the
[52:57] father and he shall give you another
[52:59] comforter then he may abide with you
[53:01] forever even the spirit of Truth whom
[53:04] the world cannot receive because it
[53:06] seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye
[53:09] know him for he dwelleth with you and
[53:11] shall be in you
[53:12] so Jesus is telling them you'll the
[53:14] world won't know him but you'll know him
[53:16] right now he's dwelling with you
[53:19] but then he'll be in you
[53:23] I will not leave you comfortless I will
[53:25] come to you so Jesus just said there's
[53:27] going to be another comforter come to
[53:29] you amen he he is the one that's with
[53:32] you and will be in you and I will not
[53:34] leave you comfortless he and he's saying
[53:36] I'm going to send you a comforter I'll
[53:37] pray to the father he'll send you a
[53:38] comforter he says I won't leave you
[53:40] comfortless I will come to you he's
[53:42] saying that I'm the comforter amen I
[53:45] will come in you amen I will be in you
[53:47] amen you're going to receive another
[53:49] comforter the spirit of truth that
[53:50] dwells with you will be in you I will
[53:53] leave you comfortless I will come unto
[53:55] you
[53:56] amen and and you begin to realize that
[54:00] that we have to see beyond carnal Beyond
[54:03] flesh amen because it's not that flesh
[54:06] body that was nailed to a cross it's not
[54:08] the one whose vocal cords was saying the
[54:10] words but it was the spirit on the
[54:12] inside that was speaking the word who
[54:14] was the comforter it was the spirit and
[54:16] Life of Christ that was going to come
[54:18] into them
[54:22] he goes on to say
[54:24] yet a little while and the world seeth
[54:27] me no more but ye see me because I live
[54:30] you shall live also
[54:32] the world won't see me but you'll see me
[54:36] but they're not going to see him with
[54:38] these physical eyes and they're not
[54:40] going to see the form that's speaking to
[54:42] them now but they will just assuredly
[54:44] see him
[54:48] praise God
[54:51] amen
[54:54] let's read that again verse 19. yet a
[54:56] little while in the world sees me no
[54:57] more but ye see me because I live ye
[54:59] live also at that day you shall know
[55:02] that I am my father and ye and me and I
[55:04] in you
[55:05] making them all one that's what the
[55:09] prophet goes on to say
[55:10] he that hath my Commandments and keepeth
[55:13] them he it is that loveth me and he that
[55:15] loveth me shall be loved to my father
[55:17] and I will love him and will manifest
[55:20] myself to him
[55:21] that means I'll show myself to him so
[55:24] he'll see me
[55:25] Judah saith unto him not not a scary
[55:28] Lord how is it that thou will manifest
[55:30] thyself unto us and not unto the world
[55:32] Jesus answered and said unto him if a
[55:35] man loved me he will keep my words and
[55:37] my father will love him and we will come
[55:39] into him and make our Abode with him
[55:42] how many people are going to live in
[55:45] this person that keeps God's
[55:46] Commandments amen
[55:48] three
[55:49] or one is there going to be the
[55:51] comforter or is it going to be Jesus or
[55:53] is it going to be the father amen and
[55:55] the answer is yes
[56:00] amen
[56:04] make our boat with him he that loveth me
[56:06] not keepeth not my sayings and the word
[56:09] which you hear is not mine but the
[56:10] father would sent me these things have I
[56:13] spoken unto you being yet present with
[56:15] you but the comforter which is the Holy
[56:18] Ghost whom the father will send in my
[56:20] name he shall teach you all things and
[56:22] bring all things into your remembrance
[56:23] whatsoever I have said unto you
[56:26] peace I leave with you my peace I give
[56:29] unto you not as the world giveth giveth
[56:32] I unto you let not your heart be
[56:34] troubled neither Let It Be Afraid
[56:38] why don't we have to be afraid because
[56:40] he's promised
[56:41] to be with us
[56:44] and we know that this promise
[56:47] came into fulfillment on the day of
[56:49] Pentecost amen when the pillar of fire
[56:51] returned back and split itself in the
[56:54] licks of fire showing that the spirit of
[56:56] Christ was entering into the church but
[56:58] we know as they went into the first
[57:00] church age amen that now there was a
[57:03] deviation from the word or a leaving
[57:05] from the word amen and the prophet of
[57:07] God tells us that that that the Holy
[57:10] Ghost the Holy Spirit has been bound by
[57:12] these denominational Rivers for nearly 2
[57:15] 000 years amen so he was bound he wasn't
[57:18] at Liberty to live and fullness in the
[57:20] church amen because of the deviation and
[57:22] separation from the word amen you
[57:24] separate from the word you separate from
[57:26] Christ
[57:27] right
[57:29] but it's to be loose the Holy Ghost
[57:31] loosed in the evening time
[57:34] amen by the evening time message the
[57:36] Holy Ghost back in the people again
[57:38] which is what Jesus Christ returning
[57:41] back to his body which is his bride amen
[57:45] not in partial measure now through the
[57:47] churches but in fullness he's come amen
[57:49] and it's him the comforter it's him
[57:51] Jesus Christ it's him the father and the
[57:54] son making their Abode in you amen all
[57:57] that God was he poured into Christ all
[57:58] that Christ was he poured into the
[58:00] church
[58:01] and what was limited and bound has been
[58:04] loosed by the evening time message to
[58:06] come back into the church again amen the
[58:09] the the the the son of man was revealed
[58:12] amen Jesus Christ appeared through a
[58:14] prophetic Ministry to bring the word
[58:16] back to the Forefront to bring Christ
[58:18] back on the scene to make the word so
[58:21] real that it'll literally unite The Head
[58:23] and the body together amen so that now
[58:26] he is here present in his body in full
[58:29] measure he has come but where is he he's
[58:33] in her
[58:34] praise God
[58:36] amen
[58:37] just like when he was here
[58:41] in Jesus Christ form
[58:44] they saw him
[58:45] and they didn't see him
[58:48] they looked for him they expected his
[58:51] coming
[58:52] that anticipations their thoughts and
[58:55] ideas he came
[58:57] he went they missed it
[59:01] he was present they didn't see it
[59:04] but there were some who saw
[59:08] and in this day he's come and multitudes
[59:12] have missed it and are missing it but
[59:15] there's some who have eyes to see and
[59:18] ears to hear
[59:20] amen there are some that have had their
[59:22] eyes open and they can see him and they
[59:25] can see him where he is and they can see
[59:27] him in the form that he's in it's always
[59:29] the form that throws him off it's always
[59:31] the form that brings confusion amen but
[59:34] it's him just the same amen when they
[59:36] were walking with Jesus Christ on the
[59:38] road to Emmaus he the scripture says he
[59:41] appeared to two others in another form
[59:43] he was in another form their eyes were
[59:45] withhold and they couldn't tell who it
[59:47] was but it was the very same one amen it
[59:50] was the same person it was Jesus Christ
[59:52] began to speak to them and discern and
[59:55] share the scriptures with them amen
[59:57] until he broke the bread a certain way
[59:58] and their eyes were open they knew who
[1:00:00] it was and he was in another form and
[1:00:03] they couldn't tell who it was but it was
[1:00:05] the same one he was there
[1:00:09] amen praise be to God and when the Jesus
[1:00:13] broke the bread it didn't open their
[1:00:15] physical eyes it opened their spiritual
[1:00:17] eyes and they could discern who it was
[1:00:20] when he returned amen when he
[1:00:22] resurrected amen and Mary was in the in
[1:00:24] the garden looking for him Mary's
[1:00:26] looking for him amen where have you laid
[1:00:28] him she's looking for a dead corpse
[1:00:30] she's looking for the one that was
[1:00:31] nailed to the cross amen and here he is
[1:00:34] standing alive amen resurrected alive
[1:00:36] but she assumes he's the gardener
[1:00:40] Mary knew what he looked like amen Mary
[1:00:42] had been with him she had served him she
[1:00:44] had talked to him amen she knew what he
[1:00:46] looked like so he's standing here in
[1:00:48] another form in the form of the gardener
[1:00:50] because he is the gardener amen and he
[1:00:53] is the seed and he is the fruit
[1:00:56] and he's standing as the gardener amen
[1:00:58] and and she doesn't know who she's
[1:01:00] talking to she's asking the gardener
[1:01:03] where Jesus is and the gardener is Jesus
[1:01:06] [Music]
[1:01:08] where is Jesus he is Jesus but he looks
[1:01:11] like a gardener and she assumes he's the
[1:01:13] gardener she thinks she's talking to a
[1:01:15] gardener and she's talking to Jesus
[1:01:16] Christ
[1:01:18] some people that think they're talking
[1:01:20] to church members they're talking to
[1:01:22] people who believe a message but they
[1:01:23] don't know what's behind those people
[1:01:25] they don't know what this word is this
[1:01:27] word that we're giving is Jesus Christ
[1:01:30] it is him he is the word
[1:01:36] she said please sir tell me where you've
[1:01:38] laid him and I'll go get him
[1:01:40] and he said Mary
[1:01:42] when he called her by name she knew who
[1:01:45] it was she said rabboni Master amen and
[1:01:49] fell at his feet amen when he called
[1:01:51] your name all of a sudden you knew who
[1:01:53] this was that was speaking to you who's
[1:01:55] present who's here who was in that
[1:01:57] prophet and who's in The Bride
[1:02:00] amen amen just because multiples the
[1:02:04] multitudes don't seem doesn't mean he's
[1:02:06] not here when everyone sees him that's
[1:02:08] not the fearing that we're looking for
[1:02:09] that's not the coming and that is
[1:02:11] exciting to us amen although that'll be
[1:02:14] exciting amen because we return with him
[1:02:15] but the one that's exciting to us is the
[1:02:18] one that's going on now when he's coming
[1:02:20] and taking us in a Rapture and catching
[1:02:22] us away word by word by word until
[1:02:24] finally we make the final translation
[1:02:28] praise be to God that's the one we see
[1:02:32] do you see it
[1:02:33] do you have eyes to see who it is
[1:02:38] praise be to God
[1:02:43] brother Benham said in the spoken word
[1:02:44] is the Original Seed
[1:02:46] he said as the end time prophecies will
[1:02:48] repeat I believe as the first Forerunner
[1:02:50] came from the Wilderness and cried
[1:02:51] Behold the Lamb of God the second
[1:02:54] Forerunner will probably do the same by
[1:02:56] pointing the people to a word born bride
[1:03:00] what's that Forerunner pointing the
[1:03:03] people to he's pointing the people to a
[1:03:05] word born bride
[1:03:08] and the bride of Christ will be pointed
[1:03:10] to the skies at the appearing of Jesus
[1:03:15] screaming Behold the Lamb of God will
[1:03:18] come forth from his lips
[1:03:22] so while the prophet is here he must
[1:03:24] introduce the bride to Christ
[1:03:27] he must point out the appearing of Jesus
[1:03:30] Christ
[1:03:31] and declare who it is
[1:03:34] that God help us to be ready for this
[1:03:36] near event I better leave it from right
[1:03:38] right here do you believe why has this
[1:03:41] been have have you a better
[1:03:44] understanding now it's it's the word
[1:03:46] friends this has been about six hours
[1:03:47] right close to five and a half or six
[1:03:50] hours there is much more could be said
[1:03:53] but surely the Holy Spirit Will by this
[1:03:55] time has sunk it so deep in you that you
[1:03:57] know what I'm talking about we're at the
[1:03:59] end time the seeds are sown now the
[1:04:01] latter rain is fixing to come forth has
[1:04:03] the latter rain come absolutely friends
[1:04:05] amen it's come
[1:04:08] remember there will be such a
[1:04:09] denominational Gathering pretty soon
[1:04:11] it'll be terrific and they will bring
[1:04:14] themselves together into this Federation
[1:04:15] of churches and when this kind of church
[1:04:17] will be put out of operation as far as
[1:04:20] they know it's at that time that Jesus
[1:04:22] will appear and he will show witch's
[1:04:24] bride and which is not
[1:04:30] sometimes I wonder how it will appear
[1:04:33] in what form
[1:04:36] he's come what form has he come in
[1:04:39] now when he appears where will he appear
[1:04:43] maybe in Bride for him
[1:04:47] and the message turned on the light from
[1:04:48] 1964 and from the ripening of the grain
[1:04:52] from all the way back from Luther all
[1:04:53] the way down through the age it ought to
[1:04:55] be the fullness of the Gospel now the
[1:04:57] power of God to ripen the light that's
[1:04:59] been shown through justification
[1:05:00] sanctification the Pentecostal age
[1:05:03] ought to ripen the bride tree for the
[1:05:05] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:05:07] Christ could be manifest in his church
[1:05:10] as one person him and his wife him and
[1:05:13] his bride this is the hour We're living
[1:05:15] this is the light of the day
[1:05:18] so what will ripen the bride tree for
[1:05:20] the coming of the Lord what's the coming
[1:05:22] of the Lord that Christ could be
[1:05:23] manifested in his church as one person
[1:05:25] him and his bride together as one person
[1:05:29] where is he he's in his bride
[1:05:33] what did he come to he came to his bride
[1:05:35] what did he Unite with the body his
[1:05:38] bride where did he come to the bride
[1:05:41] in The Invisible Union
[1:05:43] of the bride of Christ he says but you
[1:05:45] remember when it went down and the grain
[1:05:47] began to ripen that you find before that
[1:05:49] grain can ripen everything in that stalk
[1:05:51] has to be dead Hallelujah can't you see
[1:05:54] where we're standing life is in the
[1:05:55] grain again what is it just exactly the
[1:05:58] same grain that went in the ground the
[1:06:00] same Jesus in Bride form same power same
[1:06:04] church same thing same word where is he
[1:06:07] amen they don't see the form but he's
[1:06:10] there amen just as much as he was
[1:06:12] walking on the road to Emmaus with with
[1:06:14] cleopius and his friend he is here just
[1:06:18] the same only in a form and their eyes
[1:06:20] are withholden to the form but I prayed
[1:06:23] God that he will break the bread to you
[1:06:25] amen that he will break the bread with
[1:06:27] his own hands and do something in a
[1:06:29] certain way that you'll say that's him
[1:06:31] amen that's not people that's not a
[1:06:34] church that's not a group of people
[1:06:35] believing something that is Jesus Christ
[1:06:38] in Bride form
[1:06:41] amen that's where he's at
[1:06:46] praise God
[1:06:50] and the laodicean church age from the
[1:06:52] church age book I'm going to read a
[1:06:53] couple quotes out of that
[1:06:55] little little flock do not fear
[1:06:58] why won't you fear
[1:07:00] why shouldn't we fear because he is our
[1:07:03] help in a time of trouble
[1:07:05] in times of great trouble he comes
[1:07:09] he makes his appearance Amen in times of
[1:07:13] great need in times of great trouble how
[1:07:15] many times in our lives amen did we
[1:07:18] wonder where God was where are you Lord
[1:07:20] where are you Lord where are you Lord
[1:07:21] and you come down to the wire and when
[1:07:24] you come to the wire he shows up just on
[1:07:26] time in times of great trouble he makes
[1:07:28] his appearance amen he declares his
[1:07:30] presence he shows I've been with you all
[1:07:33] along
[1:07:33] [Music]
[1:07:36] praise be to God it's no different for
[1:07:38] in our lives there's no different and
[1:07:41] and the great economy of God in times of
[1:07:44] great trouble he comes he makes his
[1:07:45] appearance he declares his presence
[1:07:51] he says oh little flock do not fear
[1:07:55] this age is fast closing as it does
[1:07:57] those tears will be bound together and
[1:07:59] as the threefold court is not easily
[1:08:01] broken they will have tremendous
[1:08:02] threefold strength of political physical
[1:08:05] spiritual satanical power and they will
[1:08:08] seek to destroy the bride of Christ she
[1:08:10] will suffer but she will endure
[1:08:13] fear not those things that are coming
[1:08:15] upon the Earth for he who loved his own
[1:08:17] loved them unto the end John 13 1.
[1:08:21] no matter what it looks like don't be
[1:08:24] afraid
[1:08:25] no matter what troubles come amen
[1:08:28] there's so many things that the prophet
[1:08:30] has told us so many things that he's
[1:08:31] declared but even in the Declaration of
[1:08:34] the prophecy we don't know what it's
[1:08:36] going to look like we don't know how
[1:08:37] things will exactly happen how rough how
[1:08:40] difficult not difficult I I don't know
[1:08:42] what it was going to look like but no
[1:08:44] matter what looks like don't be afraid
[1:08:46] he is here and in times of great trouble
[1:08:48] he comes and He makes himself known amen
[1:08:52] he will appear how will he appear amen
[1:08:55] he will appear in his form Amen in Bride
[1:08:58] form that's my personal belief
[1:09:02] in the in the church age again he says
[1:09:06] this layout of cnh ends in a blackout of
[1:09:08] the word thereby causing a departure of
[1:09:11] the Lord from the midst he stands
[1:09:13] outside calling to his own who follow
[1:09:15] him by obedience to the word after a
[1:09:17] short and Powerful demonstration of the
[1:09:19] spirit this little hunted and persecuted
[1:09:21] group will go to be with Jesus
[1:09:25] she will have a deliverer on the inside
[1:09:31] she will have a help and a time of
[1:09:34] trouble inside
[1:09:37] she will have the Strong Tower that
[1:09:39] she's run into will be in her
[1:09:42] the shield and buckler will be in her
[1:09:44] the lifter of her head will be in her
[1:09:46] amen the all-sufficient one will be in
[1:09:49] her no matter what she faces don't be
[1:09:51] afraid don't worry amen there's an
[1:09:54] ability inside the bride to do a short
[1:09:56] powerful demonstration amen whatever's
[1:09:59] needed at the time he'll do amen
[1:10:02] remember brother Ben I'm talking about
[1:10:04] the manifestation of the third pool we
[1:10:06] know the third pull is the word amen and
[1:10:09] but there's a manifestation to the third
[1:10:10] boy he talks about speaking squirrels
[1:10:12] into existence speaking to his wife's
[1:10:14] tomb or amen speaking to Hattie's rights
[1:10:16] boys and and speaking to the storm in
[1:10:18] Colorado when you think about those
[1:10:21] things all of those were in a time of
[1:10:23] need amen and in the time of need the
[1:10:26] brother Branham never once said God I
[1:10:29] want to create squirrels
[1:10:31] God I want to speak to the Salvation how
[1:10:33] do you write this book he never said
[1:10:34] that it was God that told him to speak
[1:10:37] he was the mouthpiece for the God that
[1:10:39] was on the inside and if you go back and
[1:10:41] read every one of those accounts brother
[1:10:43] Branham never said I created squirrels
[1:10:45] never never never said I created
[1:10:47] squirrels he never said I moved the
[1:10:49] storm back he never said I removed my
[1:10:51] wife's tumor he always says God did that
[1:10:54] amen that was God that was not a man or
[1:10:56] the effort of the man it was God that
[1:10:59] was inside the man the Strong Tower was
[1:11:02] in the flesh body and he had to wait for
[1:11:05] the one on the inside to tell him what
[1:11:06] to do and when he did it the one on the
[1:11:09] inside performed it amen it wasn't the
[1:11:12] flesh body of William Branham it was the
[1:11:14] life of Jesus Christ in that body
[1:11:17] mother Benham you'll never hear him say
[1:11:19] I created his cross he didn't create
[1:11:20] squirrels Jesus Christ created squirrels
[1:11:24] but he used him to do it and he had
[1:11:27] somebody in obedience and subjection to
[1:11:29] him that he could trust to say the right
[1:11:32] thing at the right time
[1:11:35] what's he training you and I for to get
[1:11:37] some people that he can trust amen that
[1:11:40] will obey him and wait for him and then
[1:11:42] when given permission we'll say the
[1:11:44] right thing at the right time
[1:11:48] but then when you go back and look at
[1:11:50] those five accounts absolute Dynamic
[1:11:52] accounts of the spoken word power in uh
[1:11:56] in a hybrid body
[1:11:58] and a redeemed human being absolute
[1:12:01] Supernatural power that was manifest
[1:12:04] through a body of Flesh that was sin
[1:12:06] born
[1:12:10] and what newspaper carried the coverage
[1:12:14] what news agency did a report on it
[1:12:18] some of the most powerful demonstrations
[1:12:20] in a human being that was not virgin
[1:12:23] born
[1:12:26] and who knows it about it outside the
[1:12:27] message
[1:12:30] you see God can do powerful Dynamic
[1:12:33] wonderful things to his bride and it
[1:12:35] doesn't mean the whole world would know
[1:12:36] about it he does it for you he does it
[1:12:38] in a time of need he does it when you
[1:12:40] when you there's a need the strong
[1:12:42] Towers on the inside the help in a time
[1:12:44] of trouble he will appear Amen in his
[1:12:47] body and do whatever he needs to do he
[1:12:51] just needs somebody he will yield to the
[1:12:53] one on the inside amen
[1:12:55] somebody who will yield to the to the
[1:12:57] one in the control tower
[1:13:00] amen not using our own minds not playing
[1:13:02] games amen with the manifestation of the
[1:13:05] third pool not using our own thinking
[1:13:07] not thinking it'll be this and it'll be
[1:13:08] that and I'll say this and I'll do that
[1:13:10] you'll do nothing amen because it won't
[1:13:13] be you it'll be him in you if anything
[1:13:15] ever happens
[1:13:17] whatever it is little or a non in Psalm
[1:13:21] and not all and every I don't know
[1:13:22] what's going to happen but whatever
[1:13:24] happens it will not be you and I it'll
[1:13:27] be him and you and I it'll be Jesus
[1:13:29] Christ in the form of his bride foreign
[1:13:32] it'll be his ministry his power not hers
[1:13:40] what's he need friends he needs a
[1:13:42] yielded vessel
[1:13:43] he needs a surrendered heart he needs
[1:13:46] somebody that won't compromise on the
[1:13:48] word like Eve did
[1:13:50] he needs somebody that won't get ahead
[1:13:52] of the program like he did he needs
[1:13:53] somebody that'll wait
[1:13:56] he had it in the prophet of God Amen and
[1:13:59] through how many afflictions and trials
[1:14:01] and ups and downs and tests that he did
[1:14:03] he shape and mold that prophet
[1:14:06] to get him to that place where he could
[1:14:07] trust him to say whatever you say is
[1:14:10] what it'll be
[1:14:13] amen praise be to God
[1:14:19] let's go to Psalms 46.
[1:14:30] Psalms 46.
[1:14:40] 46 and 7 verse 7.
[1:14:44] the Lord of hosts is with us

[1:14:51] than you've ever believed it amen this

[1:15:27] god of Jacob is our refuge
[1:15:30] amen amen don't be afraid there's
[1:15:33] nothing to be afraid of
[1:15:35] you get backed into a corner there's a
[1:15:37] power that's already been demonstrated
[1:15:38] that can free the children of God from
[1:15:40] any obstacle whether it be nature
[1:15:43] whether it be need whether it be
[1:15:45] salvation amen whether it be a great
[1:15:47] tumor amen it's already been
[1:15:49] demonstrated in the hour of great need
[1:15:51] that Jesus Christ can appear amen
[1:15:56] praise the Lord
[1:16:00] in the Legacy in church age he says the
[1:16:02] wheat and the tares which from the first
[1:16:04] age until now have grown side by side
[1:16:06] are harvested
[1:16:07] when I see us set out to accomplish has
[1:16:10] finally come to pass with all the might
[1:16:12] of the organization the false Church
[1:16:14] turns from any Vestige of Truth and with
[1:16:16] political might reinforces herself with
[1:16:18] State backing and sets out to eradicate
[1:16:20] Forever The True Believer
[1:16:22] but just when she is about to accomplish
[1:16:25] her cowardly plot
[1:16:26] the wheat is gathered into the garden
[1:16:30] what do we have to be afraid of
[1:16:34] it doesn't matter what law we see past
[1:16:39] there's no point in getting up in
[1:16:41] political arms about anything these
[1:16:43] things have to happen
[1:16:45] let them happen
[1:16:47] don't get your political hat on and go
[1:16:49] out and put a banner in your yard don't
[1:16:51] do that just keep pressing on in the
[1:16:54] word amen keep living the life of Christ
[1:16:56] don't get distracted by the arguments of
[1:16:58] the world it's got to go a certain way
[1:17:00] it'll go that way and no matter what
[1:17:02] happens Let It Go brother bear said the
[1:17:04] world is falling apart let it fall apart
[1:17:06] amen
[1:17:07] America is finished don't try to restore
[1:17:10] it it's done
[1:17:13] amen amen
[1:17:16] he says just when she's about to
[1:17:19] accomplish her cowardly plot the wheat
[1:17:21] is gathered into the Garner no longer of
[1:17:23] the wheat and tears grow side by side no
[1:17:25] longer will The tares receive of the
[1:17:26] blessings of God because of the presence
[1:17:28] of the wheat for the wheat will be gone
[1:17:30] and the wrath of God will be poured out
[1:17:32] in the Sixth Seal which will end in the
[1:17:34] utter destruction of the wicked
[1:17:37] you won't be here for that if you're a
[1:17:39] child of God
[1:17:41] you're part of his bride there's nothing
[1:17:43] to be afraid of there's nothing to worry
[1:17:45] about amen no matter how close it gets
[1:17:48] we've got a promise it won't get so
[1:17:50] close that he won't rescue you and I
[1:17:53] we don't know what will happen I I don't
[1:17:56] want to get ahead of God's program I
[1:17:57] don't want to presume that I even know I
[1:17:59] have no idea all I know is what the
[1:18:01] prophet said and I believe what he said
[1:18:03] to be true
[1:18:04] how it plays out I don't know but one
[1:18:06] thing I know for sure is the same God
[1:18:08] that was with that Prophet is with his
[1:18:10] bride amen the same son of man that was
[1:18:13] in a son of man amen is continuing in
[1:18:16] the bride form amen and he can do
[1:18:18] whatever he needs to do in the time that
[1:18:21] he needs to do it amen and all we have
[1:18:24] to do is keep quiet keep serving God
[1:18:26] stick with the word and when there's a
[1:18:28] great time of need and great times of
[1:18:31] need Jesus comes amen he'll appear he'll
[1:18:33] make his presence known
[1:18:37] he'll show which is bright and which is
[1:18:40] not
[1:18:42] how
[1:18:43] I don't know
[1:18:45] I've got my own ideas but my ideas are
[1:18:47] worthless but it'll happen
[1:18:50] and when it happens we'll see
[1:18:52] and we'll see everything the prophet
[1:18:54] said was true
[1:18:56] and all we have to do is have faith and
[1:18:58] believe and trust and Hold Steady and
[1:19:01] not panic and not be afraid and not run
[1:19:04] around like crazy and not try to save
[1:19:06] ourselves and not get into a bunch of
[1:19:08] finagling and just hold steady stand
[1:19:11] still and recognize that he that is in
[1:19:13] you is greater than he that's in the
[1:19:15] world and believe it with all your heart
[1:19:17] that the god of the ages is present amen
[1:19:20] that Jesus Christ who overcame death and
[1:19:23] hell is standing with you now is in you
[1:19:25] living his life through the bride
[1:19:31] let's finish with Psalms 27.
[1:19:36] which is the scripture brother Branham
[1:19:38] opened the Rapture with
[1:19:42] Psalms 27.
[1:19:45] verse 1.
[1:19:49] Psalm 27 and 1.
[1:19:52] the Lord is my light
[1:19:54] and my salvation
[1:19:56] Whom Shall I Fear
[1:20:00] listen I don't care what the news says
[1:20:03] I don't care what your neighbors say
[1:20:06] I don't care what you see going on
[1:20:07] around you this is still the truth
[1:20:10] [Music]
[1:20:12] amen the Lord is my light and my
[1:20:13] salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is
[1:20:16] the strength of my life of whom shall I
[1:20:18] be afraid I'll tell you why this is true
[1:20:21] because this flesh is not me and nothing
[1:20:26] no weapon formed against me shall
[1:20:29] prosper because all men made weapons
[1:20:31] they only can touch the flesh but they
[1:20:34] can't touch me
[1:20:36] man don't fear him that can kill the
[1:20:38] body but fear him that can destroy the
[1:20:40] soul amen but there's it doesn't matter
[1:20:43] what you do to my body you cannot hurt
[1:20:45] me amen because nothing by any means
[1:20:47] shall hurt you no weapon formed against
[1:20:49] me shall prosper you can shoot me but
[1:20:52] you have not destroyed me amen you can
[1:20:54] shoot me but you have not hurt me
[1:20:58] amen because me will live on Amen
[1:21:00] remember Peter when Peter comes to the
[1:21:03] end of his ministry he said the time of
[1:21:05] my departure is at hand
[1:21:08] he didn't say the time of my death
[1:21:11] because Peter wasn't going to die
[1:21:13] he was going to lay down the robe of
[1:21:15] Flesh and he was going to move on with
[1:21:17] the same life that was in him was going
[1:21:18] to continue on somewhere else
[1:21:21] so he said the time of my departure is
[1:21:23] at hand amen he said as the Lord has
[1:21:26] shown me he knew and he wasn't grieving
[1:21:28] over it he wasn't scared about it he
[1:21:30] wasn't upset and his departure wasn't an
[1:21:33] easy departure he was hung upside down
[1:21:35] on the cross but it didn't hurt Peter
[1:21:37] any amen if you asked Peter today if it
[1:21:40] hurt him he'll say no it didn't hurt me
[1:21:42] because he's got the same life he had
[1:21:45] when he was in this body he's living
[1:21:46] somewhere else
[1:21:50] Paul the Apostle in second Timothy says
[1:21:54] the time of my departure is at hand I'm
[1:21:56] sorry Peter says shortly Peter Peter won
[1:22:00] a First Peter 1 14. shortly I must put
[1:22:03] off this Tabernacle
[1:22:06] oh what language
[1:22:09] what Revelation what understanding
[1:22:12] shortly I must put off this Tabernacle
[1:22:15] hey I tell you what you may think it's a
[1:22:18] morbid thought but I crossed 45 and when
[1:22:20] I crossed 45 I said hey at least I'm
[1:22:23] probably halfway done
[1:22:25] done
[1:22:28] do you may sound morbid but this isn't
[1:22:31] the life I'm living for I'm here serving
[1:22:33] my purpose serving my king fulfilling
[1:22:35] the purpose he has for me but my life
[1:22:37] when this robe is dropped my life will
[1:22:40] continue on Amen I I I'm not going to
[1:22:43] die I cannot perish I cannot be hurt by
[1:22:46] anything man has made no scheme of man
[1:22:49] no plot of man no weapon of man nothing
[1:22:52] can hurt me it couldn't hurt Peter amen
[1:22:56] Paul was beheaded all it was was his
[1:22:59] departure yeah
[1:23:00] Peter was hung upside down on a cross
[1:23:03] all it was was dropping the robe of
[1:23:05] flashing he changed Tabernacles
[1:23:10] so many people want to upgrade houses
[1:23:13] when the housing market started taking
[1:23:15] off everybody went sell and upgrade sell
[1:23:17] and upgrade I'm telling you we got the
[1:23:19] best upgrade policy in the world all we
[1:23:21] got to do is drop this robe and go to
[1:23:24] another one we've got the best the best
[1:23:26] upgrade amen and and I'm not looking to
[1:23:29] stay in this pest house when my time to
[1:23:31] upgrade comes so I'm not afraid of the
[1:23:34] upgrade
[1:23:36] whatever method it comes by amen the
[1:23:40] devil he controls Us by fear amen so
[1:23:43] much fear in the world and so much fear
[1:23:45] of what will happen in fear of
[1:23:47] situations and fear of pain amen if we
[1:23:51] could just lose the fear the devil would
[1:23:53] lose so much control over us
[1:23:56] if we weren't afraid of what people
[1:23:58] thought if we weren't afraid of the
[1:24:00] consequences for following the word if
[1:24:01] we weren't afraid of persecution if we
[1:24:04] weren't afraid of Shame if we weren't
[1:24:05] afraid of if we weren't afraid the devil
[1:24:08] would lose so much control over you and
[1:24:11] I
[1:24:13] God help us to stand with your word and
[1:24:16] believe it give us a greater Faith to
[1:24:19] believe it the way David believed it
[1:24:21] David believed in the natural I believe
[1:24:22] it in the spiritual
[1:24:28] let's keep reading Psalms 27.
[1:24:34] the Lord is the strength of my life
[1:24:37] of whom shall I be afraid
[1:24:39] when the wicked even mine enemies and my
[1:24:41] foes come upon me to eat up my flesh
[1:24:43] they stumbled and fell
[1:24:45] though a host should have Camp against
[1:24:47] me my heart shall not fear
[1:24:52] they closed the doors to the church
[1:24:54] rejoice
[1:24:57] they only think they stopped the church
[1:24:59] the building's not the church they can't
[1:25:01] stop the church by closing the doors
[1:25:04] though a host of the camping gives me my
[1:25:06] heart shall not fear the war shall rise
[1:25:08] up against me and this will I be
[1:25:10] confident one thing have I desired of
[1:25:12] the Lord that will I seek after that I
[1:25:14] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[1:25:16] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[1:25:19] of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple
[1:25:21] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[1:25:24] me in his Pavilion and the secret of his
[1:25:28] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[1:25:30] me up upon a rock
[1:25:32] and now shall my head be lifted up above
[1:25:35] mine enemies round about me therefore
[1:25:38] will I offer in his Tabernacle
[1:25:39] sacrifices of Joy I will sing yeah I
[1:25:43] will sing praises unto the Lord
[1:25:47] if the time of trouble equals going into
[1:25:50] the secret of his Pavilion
[1:25:53] then we should welcome the time of
[1:25:54] trouble
[1:25:56] if it's in a great time of trouble he
[1:25:58] comes we should welcome a great time of
[1:25:59] trouble when he appears in times of
[1:26:02] great need when he shows his right hand
[1:26:04] of power in times that there's great
[1:26:06] need then we shouldn't be so afraid of
[1:26:08] the times of great need we should just
[1:26:10] accept what comes and trusts that this
[1:26:12] is going to be a fantastic manifestation
[1:26:15] of the power of God
[1:26:17] this is going to be God doing something
[1:26:19] again I don't know how he'll do it I
[1:26:21] don't know what he'll do I can't dictate
[1:26:23] what he'll do but I'm standing with the
[1:26:25] word and believing I'm getting ready to
[1:26:27] see God move on the scene
[1:26:29] let's turn if we could turn fear into
[1:26:32] expectation
[1:26:35] if we could just get a hold of the
[1:26:37] emotional side and push the fear away
[1:26:40] and change the fear to to joyful
[1:26:43] expectation
[1:26:45] and saying I don't know how he'll figure
[1:26:48] this one out
[1:26:50] but I can't wait to see what he does now
[1:26:56] there's so many
[1:26:58] potentials possibilities difficult
[1:27:01] circumstances and situations
[1:27:04] there's so much potential out there for
[1:27:08] fearful situations
[1:27:10] so much that can go wrong so much in the
[1:27:14] attitudes of the people that can change
[1:27:16] overnight
[1:27:18] so much in the world structure that that
[1:27:21] can become tumultuous and unstable
[1:27:24] there's so much to be afraid of
[1:27:28] but there's more
[1:27:30] to give us faith
[1:27:33] there's more promises in the word
[1:27:35] there's more manifestations there's more
[1:27:37] evidence as we've seen more Amen in the
[1:27:40] manifestation of a son of man uh the son
[1:27:43] of man through a son of man than
[1:27:45] anything the world can throw at us to
[1:27:46] know that it's all going to be okay no
[1:27:48] matter what happens there is a power
[1:27:50] that is with us there is a presence a
[1:27:53] person that is in the bride that can
[1:27:55] solve all problems
[1:27:57] that can provide all needs and all he
[1:28:00] needs is a willing vessel and he may
[1:28:03] need your vocal cords but if he uses
[1:28:05] your vocal cords amen then praise God
[1:28:07] when he ordains and when he instructs
[1:28:10] and he uses your vocal course then he
[1:28:12] will do what he's promised to do
[1:28:15] just trust him believe him and be
[1:28:19] excited
[1:28:20] we've seen him appear he's come
[1:28:24] now times of trouble he'll appear again
[1:28:27] in his bride
[1:28:29] to show that who was bride and who was
[1:28:33] not
[1:28:34] I say it's in it it's going to be an
[1:28:37] exciting time
[1:28:39] may God build us in faith
[1:28:42] may God help us to shed all the natural
[1:28:47] and give us more revelation of his word
[1:28:49] to build more of that perfect faith so
[1:28:52] that we can hold steady in the time of
[1:28:54] trouble and watch God deliver

[1:29:38] he appears amen he comes there's
[1:29:41] something getting ready to happen and
