[14:17] difference isn't it
[14:19] hallelujah we're happy for you it's
[14:21] privileged to have you here
[14:22] let's look at verse seven daniel chapter
[14:25] 12 verse 7.
[14:29] and i heard the man clothed in linen
[14:31] which was upon the waters of the river
[14:33] when he held up his right hand and his
[14:35] left hand unto heaven
[14:36] and swear by him that liveth forever
[14:38] that it shall be for a time
[14:40] times and a half time and a half which
[14:43] is three and a half years
[14:44] and when he shall have accomplished to
[14:46] scatter the power of the holy people
[14:48] all these things shall be finished and i
[14:50] heard but i understood not
[14:52] then said i o my lord what shall be the
[14:54] end of these things
[14:56] and he said go thy way daniel for the
[14:58] words are closed up
[15:00] and sealed till the time of the end many
[15:02] shall be purified and made white and
[15:04] tried
[15:05] but the wicked shall do wickedly and
[15:07] none of the wicked shall understand
[15:09] but the wise shall understand amen let's
[15:13] bow our heads
[15:15] dear heavenly father we thank you lord
[15:17] that we can come
[15:18] to read this passage of scripture lord
[15:20] and it has so much more meaning to us
[15:22] than ever before
[15:24] and lord we just believe that we're your
[15:25] chosen where you're elected and you're
[15:27] revealing yourself to us because you
[15:29] want us to know
[15:30] god i pray that you would purify us and
[15:32] make us white by the washing of the
[15:34] water of your word
[15:36] and lord as we look into these things
[15:37] lord there's no man that could open
[15:39] these seals
[15:40] lord only you the lamb could open them
[15:42] but lord as we look into them we pray
[15:44] that you just open our eyes to see
[15:46] lord to understand that we might gain
[15:48] strength for this journey and strength
[15:50] for the flight out of here
[15:52] we love you we ask your blessing to be
[15:54] upon us your preeminence would be in
[15:55] this place
[15:56] that you would take this vessel and
[15:57] minister your word to your children
[16:00] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[16:03] you can all be seated lord bless you
[16:08] i want to say we had a really wonderful
[16:10] youth meeting this past friday night at
[16:12] the collider park and
[16:13] we thank sister joyce for putting that
[16:15] together and those who helped her
[16:17] we had a really nice time and and we
[16:19] went over the third pool with the youth
[16:21] and just
[16:22] it was just amazing you know you have i
[16:24] i always marvel that we've got
[16:27] young adults and teenagers that sit
[16:29] there and they get excited hearing about
[16:31] three pools
[16:32] a vision of an end time prophet and the
[16:35] third pool and the opening of the word
[16:37] and
[16:38] you've got young adults and teenagers
[16:39] that are getting excited
[16:41] and responding and saying amen and
[16:43] nodding their head in a park
[16:44] and picnic tables sitting around and you
[16:47] know i love this lesson it was my
[16:49] favorite because i got to use a fishing
[16:50] pole
[16:51] and so i got to show them the vision and
[16:53] the three pools and
[16:54] but it was amazing that the young people
[16:56] want to know these things
[16:58] they weren't interested in what game
[17:00] they could play or what the activity was
[17:02] for the afternoon they came for the word
[17:04] they enjoyed the word and they enjoyed
[17:06] the fellowship and i just say god bless
[17:08] them amen it's amazing
[17:09] so we had a wonderful time and i enjoyed
[17:12] myself very much
[17:13] but you know many shall be purified
[17:18] and made white and
[17:21] tried this word
[17:24] is going to purify many and make them
[17:27] white
[17:28] and try them right because brother
[17:31] branham said this evil age is to prove
[17:33] to satan
[17:34] that she's not like eve was that she's
[17:37] going to be tried by the word but she's
[17:39] not going to fail by the word she's
[17:41] predestinated not to
[17:42] and that's why god has opened excuse me
[17:45] the word to this bride
[17:46] let's turn to the book of revelation
[17:50] if we could bring up the powerpoint
[18:00] excuse me we're staying in the fourth
[18:02] seal and you'll have to excuse me for
[18:04] lying vanities but i don't give them any
[18:06] credit and i don't care
[18:07] beans about what's going to happen and
[18:10] whatever i just preach
[18:12] it doesn't bother me don't let it bother
[18:14] you let's just keep going amen
[18:16] so if the if something happens we'll
[18:18] just keep going we don't care
[18:20] and now that i mentioned it everybody
[18:21] starts coughing that's a bunch of lies
[18:24] amen let's just focus on the word and
[18:27] let that fade off
[18:28] the scene praise god yep there it is
[18:32] so we know that that we've we've had for
[18:37] for almost 2 000 years the seals
[18:40] amen that were opened they were opened
[18:42] in symbol form
[18:44] but the thunders were closed with the
[18:46] thunders as the revelation of what the
[18:48] symbols meant
[18:49] and so it's been a closed book for
[18:50] thousands of years but at the end time
[18:53] we read here that it's going to be open
[18:56] let's look at revelations 10
[18:58] verse 1 and i saw another mighty angel
[19:00] come down from heaven clothed with a
[19:02] cloud
[19:03] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[19:05] face was as it were the sun
[19:07] and his feet as pillars of fire and he
[19:10] had in his hand a little book open and
[19:11] he set his right foot upon the sea and
[19:13] his left foot upon the earth
[19:15] and cried with a loud voice is when a
[19:17] lion roareth and when he had cried
[19:19] seven thunders uttered their voices and
[19:22] when the seven thunders had uttered
[19:23] their voices
[19:24] i was about to write and i heard a voice
[19:26] from heaven saying unto me
[19:28] seal up those things which the seven
[19:30] thunders uttered and write them
[19:32] not so here john was commissioned to
[19:34] write
[19:35] he was supposed to write everything he
[19:36] saw but he gets to this point
[19:38] and the mighty angel comes down roars is
[19:40] when a lion roareth
[19:42] amen this is the mighty angel this is
[19:44] this is christ
[19:45] coming down with an open book in his
[19:47] hand so it's the return of christ amen
[19:50] in angelic form in the
[19:51] form of the holy ghost coming with an
[19:53] open book in his hand
[19:54] and he roars as when a lion roareth
[19:56] because this is the coming of the king
[19:58] and he's coming looking for his queen to
[20:00] come stand by his side
[20:03] but then there was seven thunders that
[20:04] uttered their voices and john
[20:06] being a scribe he was told to write
[20:08] everything that he saw
[20:10] and everything that he heard and he goes
[20:11] to do what he's supposed to do but he
[20:13] was told to seal it up
[20:14] which brings us right back to daniel
[20:17] because daniel had seen these things and
[20:19] heard these
[20:20] things but he wanted another
[20:22] understanding or greater understanding
[20:24] and he was told to seal the things up he
[20:26] said they're sealed up until the time of
[20:27] the end
[20:28] and here we have john standing there
[20:30] seeing the vision
[20:31] almost 2 000 years ago and he catches
[20:34] the revelation of the seven thunders
[20:36] and he goes to write them down and he's
[20:38] told to seal them up amen
[20:40] because it's got to be sealed up till
[20:41] the time of the end so the time that
[20:43] these things are unsealed
[20:44] is the time of the end and that's why
[20:46] brother branham calls revelations 10
[20:49] he calls it the seventh seal
[20:52] and he calls it the end time seal
[20:55] because when the seventh seal opens
[20:57] he said the preaching of those seven
[20:58] thunders amen that that's what it was
[21:01] and so preaching of the seven seals was
[21:03] the seven thunders
[21:04] and that's the end time seal because
[21:07] it's sealed till the time of the end
[21:10] so the time that it's unsealed marks the
[21:13] end time
[21:15] all right that's why the seventh seal is
[21:18] the end time
[21:19] seal verse 5 and the angel which i saw
[21:23] stand upon the sea and upon the earth
[21:24] lifted up his hand to heaven
[21:26] and swore by him that liveth forever and
[21:28] ever skip down to verse 7
[21:30] but in the days of the voice of the
[21:31] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[21:33] sound the mystery of god should be
[21:35] finished
[21:36] as he hath declared to his servants the
[21:38] prophets
[21:40] so we see here that that in the days of
[21:43] the voice of the seventh angel
[21:45] when he shall begin to sound brother
[21:46] branham said not when he went out in
[21:47] healing campaigns and on evangelistic
[21:49] but when he began to reveal the word
[21:52] amen that's
[21:53] that's when he began to sound and so the
[21:56] seventh angel began to sound amen
[22:00] and the mystery of god should be
[22:02] finished so we know that there's
[22:03] something important
[22:05] that that's the voice god is in this
[22:07] last day drawing us
[22:08] to the voice let's go back to chapter
[22:11] six of revelation
[22:13] revelation chapter six verse seven we're
[22:16] going to read the two scriptures that
[22:17] pertain to the fourth seal
[22:21] chapter six verse seven and when he had
[22:23] opened the fourth seal
[22:24] i heard the voice of the fourth beast
[22:27] i remember we talked sunday this is the
[22:29] first time this terminology is used
[22:32] in the first four seals before i heard
[22:35] the beast say
[22:36] and i've heard the voice of the sec or
[22:38] i've heard the second beast say
[22:39] i heard the third beast say for the
[22:41] previous third three
[22:43] three times that the beast spoke it said
[22:45] i heard the beast
[22:46] say but now when we get to the fourth
[22:48] beast is that i heard the voice
[22:50] of the fourth beast so god is honing
[22:54] us down so that we can catch that
[22:55] there's a voice here
[22:57] speaking amen it was it was the it was
[22:59] the great eagle the mighty eagle
[23:01] speaking through a prophet eagle and it
[23:03] was the voice of the fourth beast
[23:07] it was the voice of the seventh angel
[23:10] now let's go back to revelations chapter
[23:12] three and verse 20.
[23:17] this is the seventh church age so we've
[23:19] got the seventh church age
[23:20] the fourth seal and revelations 10 7 the
[23:23] seventh angel
[23:24] and they're all saying the same thing
[23:27] revelation
[23:28] 3 20 behold i stand at the door and
[23:31] knock
[23:31] if any man hear my voice
[23:36] and open the door i will come in and sup
[23:38] with him
[23:39] and he with me so here in the seventh
[23:41] church age
[23:43] we're at laodicea he says behold i stand
[23:46] at the door and knock
[23:47] if any man hear my voice
[23:51] not if anybody hears my knock
[23:54] he's standing at the door because he's
[23:56] been put outside the church in laodicea
[23:58] and he's knocking to get in but how's he
[24:00] knocking he's knocking with his voice
[24:03] if any man hear my voice and open the
[24:05] door i'll come into him
[24:06] and when we get to the fourth seal the
[24:08] fourth seal takes place
[24:10] at the laodicean church age these all
[24:12] come together
[24:13] and in the four seal he heard the voice
[24:16] of the fourth beast
[24:17] amen and that voice of the fourth beast
[24:19] was the voice of the seventh angel
[24:21] amen so here we have revelation 10 7
[24:25] revelation 6 7 and revelations 3
[24:28] 20 all pointing to the same thing
[24:32] hallelujah i love the word of god
[24:35] it just keeps getting clearer and
[24:37] clearer and clearer
[24:39] so we another thing i want to explain
[24:41] and this will get clearer later don't
[24:43] don't don't get ahead just listen to
[24:45] what i'm saying because i want to lay a
[24:46] foundation
[24:48] uh i'm hoping to to do some teaching
[24:50] today but we'll see because sometimes i
[24:52] go to teach and we preach and sometimes
[24:53] i go to preach and we teach
[24:55] we just trust god to do whatever he
[24:57] wants to do you just get what you need
[24:59] from the lord today
[25:00] and everything will be just fine but
[25:03] we find that the fourth seal
[25:07] and the fifth seal and the sixth seal
[25:10] and the seventh seal all overlap and
[25:13] intertwine
[25:15] so when we're coming through the first
[25:16] four seals it's following the church
[25:19] ages it's moving up and brother branham
[25:21] said like going up steps one laps over
[25:23] the other just like the church ages
[25:24] when you get to the fourth seal you've
[25:26] come to the end of the church ages
[25:28] and the fourth seal goes on into
[25:30] tribulation which is the sixth seal
[25:32] because when the bride goes up the devil
[25:34] comes down and
[25:35] incarnates amen the beast who's riding
[25:38] the fourth horse
[25:39] and goes into tribulation so you can see
[25:41] the fourth c on the sixth seal run on
[25:43] parallel tracks
[25:45] and the fifth seal has something to do
[25:48] with the fourth
[25:48] with the with the fourth seal and the
[25:50] sixth seal also and
[25:52] the seventh seal because it's the end
[25:54] time seal
[25:56] so so don't get in your head that we
[25:58] have to finish one before we move to the
[25:59] next one and finish this before we move
[26:01] to the next one
[26:02] those last several seals are all
[26:04] intertwined and happening at the same
[26:05] time
[26:07] so we'll go into that more as we go on
[26:10] in the seals
[26:11] but but but don't don't let that clog up
[26:14] your mind just take it for face value
[26:16] and we'll explain more later
[26:20] brother branham says in the souls that
[26:22] were in prison now the mystery was in
[26:24] the seven seals
[26:25] when these seven seals were opened they
[26:27] opened up the entire bible
[26:29] the seven seals it was sealed with seven
[26:31] mysteries and then these seven seals
[26:33] held the entire mystery of it so this is
[26:37] we've been over this before but this is
[26:39] really important to know
[26:40] that we're not just talking about the
[26:41] church ages we're not just talking about
[26:44] what happened in the last 2000 years but
[26:46] there's a there's a revelation
[26:48] contained in the seven seals that's
[26:49] explaining redemption and explaining the
[26:51] redemption
[26:52] of the seed of god and it explains the
[26:54] whole bible because the whole bible is
[26:55] talking about man
[26:57] falling and man being restored
[27:00] so the book of redemption covers that so
[27:03] for us
[27:04] it's now an open book it's been unsealed
[27:06] and it's been opened
[27:09] and the fourth seal says so happy to be
[27:11] back in the house of the lord tonight in
[27:12] the service again
[27:14] i'm so happy just thought this one
[27:16] wouldn't come he's talking about the
[27:18] fourth seal
[27:19] thought this one wouldn't come but it
[27:20] finally did and so i'm so
[27:22] thankful that being the last of those
[27:24] four horse riders
[27:25] which i think is one of the main
[27:28] messages to the church
[27:29] at this time and i'd say that's true
[27:33] one of the main messages to the church
[27:35] of this time because this is where we
[27:37] are
[27:37] friends in the fourth seal
[27:41] excuse me he says but
[27:44] if you'd set down with one of them seals
[27:47] why
[27:48] you could take a month's sermon every
[27:50] night right on the seal and still
[27:52] not touch it on one of them
[27:55] and that's how much there is to it but i
[27:57] just hit the high spots of it
[27:58] then you can see what it's all about up
[28:01] until several months ago
[28:02] i had no clue what this meant
[28:06] because i was looking at the seals as
[28:07] purely historical
[28:09] covering the church ages and just
[28:11] explaining how the church
[28:12] fell amen at nicaea and with that
[28:15] understanding you read through the seals
[28:17] and yep i got it it's historical and it
[28:19] shows how the church fell
[28:20] amen and we got it but but that's not
[28:22] what brother benham said about the seals
[28:24] he said they're much more to it than
[28:26] that
[28:27] it's not just for what happened it's
[28:28] also for what will happen
[28:30] when he comes to the fifth seal he said
[28:32] lord let us see these things so we know
[28:33] what we should do in the days that are
[28:35] ahead amen
[28:37] so it's important to know that that this
[28:39] is the entire mystery of the whole bible
[28:41] lays in these seals i think we're on our
[28:45] third sermon on the fourth seal and
[28:48] we'll see what god will do
[28:49] how open it but we know this is the pale
[28:53] horse
[28:54] all the previous three are wound up into
[28:56] this one
[28:57] and the previous three are a religious
[28:59] power
[29:00] a political power and demon power all
[29:03] united into one
[29:05] and this is the pale horse that rides in
[29:07] the fourth seal
[29:08] it's spiritual death it's also physical
[29:10] death
[29:12] it's the incarnate devil amen but
[29:15] god sent out to combat that the
[29:17] anointing of the eagle
[29:18] which is god himself which is prophets
[29:23] and children of god amen
[29:26] are you an eagle then hey you're in the
[29:30] fourth seal
[29:31] remember the eagle is totally different
[29:33] than the first three beasts
[29:34] i mean the first three beasts are
[29:36] earth-bound beasts
[29:37] the the fourth is not earthbound
[29:40] he can fly the first four start on milk
[29:44] or the first three start on milk the
[29:45] fourth doesn't start on milk he starts
[29:47] on meat
[29:48] amen it's totally different anointing
[29:50] than what we had before
[29:52] amen it is god himself amen and first it
[29:55] was god himself
[29:56] the great eagle showing himself and a
[29:59] prophet eagle brother branham
[30:01] so now we have a son of man revealing
[30:03] the son of man
[30:05] we know that and that's the first
[30:06] display amen that's coming forth
[30:09] to bring forth the word because there's
[30:10] a restoration back to the original word
[30:13] we believe that but the word can never
[30:16] come without prophets it never has
[30:18] it never will it takes profit so an
[30:20] eagle had to come
[30:21] and the great eagle had to speak through
[30:23] this eagle that he could restore the
[30:25] word
[30:25] and when he restored the word he was
[30:27] restoring the church
[30:29] back to its right position and when he
[30:31] did he's calling for all the little
[30:33] eaglets to come up and manifest himself
[30:35] and he's calling not for just a prophet
[30:38] eagle in this day
[30:39] he's calling for all the eagles to come
[30:41] to manifestation
[30:44] hallelujah and when they all come to
[30:46] manifestation
[30:47] and they all come into maturity then
[30:49] they all fly away home
[30:52] hallelujah so but now when it comes
[30:56] forth the eagle age that's the one that
[30:58] god always likens his prophets the
[30:59] eagles
[31:00] he calls himself an eagle the eagle so
[31:02] goes so high
[31:04] there ain't nothing else can touch him
[31:05] not only is he up there but he's built
[31:07] for that position
[31:08] when he gets up there he sees where he's
[31:10] at some people get up there and can't
[31:12] see where they're at
[31:13] so don't do no good to get up there see
[31:16] this eagle flies with prophetic vision
[31:20] amen and and that's unlocked to the
[31:22] children of god by revelation
[31:24] not by intellectual understanding but by
[31:26] revelation
[31:29] now wednesday wednesday we were talking
[31:31] about satan cast
[31:33] down and i'm not gonna have time to go
[31:34] into that so if you weren't here
[31:36] wednesday i encourage you to go watch
[31:37] it watch that service there's some
[31:39] things i said there that i want to pull
[31:40] out and labor on today but
[31:42] but satan's cast down and satan's cast
[31:45] down when the bride goes up
[31:47] so these eagles coming to their position
[31:49] to full maturity
[31:50] being able to fly into the heavenlies
[31:52] when they go satan is cast
[31:54] down and when he's cast down he fully
[31:56] incarnates one man on earth and that's
[31:58] the pope
[31:59] he's called the beast amen
[32:02] all right but before that we see that
[32:05] the
[32:06] the antichrist spirit is coming to
[32:08] fullness already and the devil is
[32:10] incarnating a church
[32:12] a group of people to bring about the
[32:14] world council of churches and unite them
[32:16] back
[32:17] to build the system that'll shut down
[32:18] the bride and while that's going on
[32:20] god himself is incarnating his church
[32:25] so you have the devil entering a church
[32:27] and you have god entering a church
[32:29] and you have the same thing you've
[32:30] always had you've always had this
[32:32] warfare that started in heaven
[32:34] when lucifer rebelled against michael
[32:36] and it's always been satan in christ
[32:38] every time
[32:38] it's always been christ an antichrist
[32:40] it's always been life and
[32:42] death and that's why when we get to the
[32:44] fourth anointing to the fourth beast
[32:46] now there's a prophet on the scene and
[32:48] when there's a prophet there
[32:49] now this horse rider who's been riding
[32:52] the white horse
[32:53] and the red horse and the black horse
[32:55] now there's an eagle here
[32:56] that can say that's death that's who
[33:00] that is
[33:00] now you know who's been riding all along
[33:04] couldn't happen until the eagle was
[33:06] flying couldn't happen until the prophet
[33:07] was on the scene
[33:09] so now in this the seal today we want to
[33:13] talk about
[33:14] uh the the word coming back the return
[33:17] of the word because we find out that the
[33:19] word returns to the church
[33:21] in the fourth seal hallelujah
[33:26] now i'm going to stop and slow down
[33:30] because i like to stop and slow down
[33:32] sometimes
[33:33] i get ahead of myself and i forget some
[33:34] things we have to remember
[33:37] that jesus christ is the word
[33:42] don't ever forget that amen when the
[33:45] logos came out of god
[33:47] that was the sun when the logos came out
[33:51] of god when the thought of god began to
[33:53] materialize
[33:54] and the word of god came forth as the
[33:55] logos that's the son of god
[33:58] and god and jesus christ is the word
[34:02] and the word was made flesh and received
[34:04] the name of jesus
[34:05] christ the anointed one and that is the
[34:07] word jesus christ
[34:09] is the word don't ever forget that
[34:12] so when we talk about return of the word
[34:15] we're talking about the return of
[34:17] jesus christ it's the return of the
[34:19] person of the word
[34:21] amen it doesn't do any good to get all
[34:23] the greek understanding of all these
[34:25] words
[34:25] amen we're not looking for an
[34:27] understanding of words
[34:28] we're looking for the return of a person
[34:30] amen
[34:32] hallelujah this is going to be
[34:36] good just just be patient don't don't
[34:39] i've got several quotes i want to read
[34:41] don't get distracted don't lose me stay
[34:43] right with me
[34:44] because this is going to be really
[34:45] really good genesis
[34:48] 3 14 and the lord god said unto the
[34:50] serpent because thou hast done this thou
[34:52] art cursed above all cattle
[34:53] and above every beast of the field upon
[34:55] my belly shalt thou go and dust shalt
[34:57] thou eat
[34:58] all the days of thy life and i will put
[35:00] enmity between thee
[35:02] and the woman in between thy seed and
[35:04] her seed it shall bruise thy head
[35:06] and thou shalt bruise his heel and we
[35:08] know starting here is a prophecy
[35:11] of jesus christ coming on the scene this
[35:13] is the prophecy of the woman of the seed
[35:16] the the seed of the woman i'm sorry the
[35:18] seed of the woman that will bruise the
[35:20] head of the serpent
[35:21] so laying right here at the fall god
[35:24] gives a prophecy
[35:26] and what brother barum tells us is god
[35:27] is saying i'm going to restore
[35:30] you and the only way i can restore you
[35:32] is when i bring the
[35:33] the word and full manifestation through
[35:35] you and when i bring the word and full
[35:37] manifestation
[35:38] through you that will restore you
[35:42] oh bring it home write today right today
[35:46] when he takes the woman that has fallen
[35:48] in the eve
[35:49] she she was beguiled by the serpent she
[35:51] come and by deception she fell
[35:53] by the word of god but god is going to
[35:55] bring away to redeem her back
[35:57] and the only way to redeem her back is
[36:00] he has to bring the word
[36:01] through her into full manifestation
[36:04] and when he brings the word through her
[36:06] to full manifestation
[36:08] that's her redemption
[36:12] do you know what day you live in you
[36:13] live in the day where the word is coming
[36:16] through the bride
[36:17] and the word coming through the bride is
[36:19] her redemption
[36:21] it's the same prophecy that was laid
[36:22] down here that brought jesus christ in
[36:25] physical form
[36:26] is the same exact prophecy that brings
[36:28] him back in full word form
[36:30] and that is your redemption
[36:33] oh hallelujah you're working on an
[36:36] ancient prophecy
[36:38] one of the first prophecies of
[36:39] redemption the first prophecy of
[36:40] redemption that was laid down in the
[36:42] scripture
[36:43] is the one that we are still relying on
[36:45] today
[36:47] hallelujah don't forget the word is
[36:49] eternal
[36:50] and it never fades away and it always
[36:53] works
[36:54] this prophecy wasn't just to eve
[36:58] amen it was to the seed of god
[37:05] prophet of god says now notice the
[37:07] natural woman fell and god made a way
[37:09] for her to be redeemed
[37:11] although she had fallen he made a way
[37:13] now that was the first bride on earth
[37:15] fell before her husband and her were
[37:17] married
[37:18] she fell by reason of reasoning instead
[37:20] of staying with the word she fell
[37:22] and she fell to death eternal separation
[37:24] with her
[37:25] she took her husband and everything else
[37:28] there was on earth she fell
[37:30] but now but god full of mercy made a way
[37:33] to redeem the woman and now he promised
[37:36] her telling her that sometime in the
[37:38] future
[37:39] the true word would come to her again
[37:42] the true word would be made known to her
[37:44] now remember that
[37:46] because he promised christ through the
[37:47] woman and christ
[37:49] is the word saint john 1 in the
[37:51] beginning was the word and the word was
[37:53] with god and the word was god
[37:55] and the word became flesh and dwelt with
[37:57] us god dwelt with us in flesh
[38:00] he was the word
[38:03] hallelujah so this prophecy of thy seed
[38:07] amen a woman doesn't have a seed so this
[38:09] is the seed of christ the word coming
[38:12] through the woman
[38:13] and that that will bruise the serpent's
[38:15] head
[38:17] he goes on to say now now we notice that
[38:19] god told eve that after so long a time
[38:22] the word is coming back to you how did
[38:24] she fall
[38:25] i want the class to say it what did she
[38:28] fall from
[38:28] what did eve fall from the word
[38:32] don't don't think in your mind that she
[38:34] fell because of adultery
[38:38] adultery was the attribute amen or the
[38:40] physical manifestation of her fall
[38:43] amen but she fell her fall was by by
[38:46] disobeying the word
[38:47] actually by disbelieving the word
[38:51] and by disbelieving the manifestation of
[38:53] her lack of faith was adultery
[38:55] but she didn't fall by adultery she fell
[38:57] by disbelief
[38:59] hallelujah that's why you can't fall by
[39:02] drinking and smoking and running around
[39:04] that's not what you fall by
[39:05] you fall by unbelief amen and that's why
[39:08] this bride is being restored
[39:09] back to the original faith or belief
[39:13] of the fathers because she overcomes by
[39:16] faith because the problem was unbelief
[39:21] and god's going to take care of unbelief
[39:25] what did he fall from the word is that
[39:27] right the word and god said he'd make a
[39:29] way to redeem her back
[39:30] to the word again all right after so
[39:32] long a time the word would be known to
[39:34] her all right the word
[39:35] would come for one purpose now hold
[39:38] tight now what i'm saying
[39:40] the word would come to her for one
[39:42] purpose
[39:43] that was for redemption
[39:47] the woman needed to be redeemed amen the
[39:50] whole human race
[39:51] needed to be redeemed because of what
[39:53] happened in the beginning
[39:54] and now the word was going to come the
[39:56] seed of the woman was going to come
[39:58] it was going to come for one purpose and
[40:00] one purpose only
[40:01] and that was for redemption
[40:08] hallelujah
[40:11] jesus spoke the same thing when he was
[40:13] on earth he would send it again
[40:16] listen jesus is here jesus was on earth
[40:20] the fullness of the word made manifest
[40:23] in a body
[40:24] and he's come in the purpose of the word
[40:26] coming through the woman
[40:27] he's now the seed of the woman he's now
[40:29] the fulfillment of genesis 3
[40:32] he's the fulfillment of the prophecy
[40:33] that yet he
[40:35] standing on earth is the fulfillment of
[40:36] the prophecy knows
[40:38] that this woman is going to do the same
[40:40] thing again
[40:42] so he lays down another prophecy
[40:46] in matthew 17 10 and his disciples asked
[40:48] him saying
[40:49] why then say the scribes that elias must
[40:52] first come
[40:52] and jesus answered and said to them
[40:55] elias truly
[40:56] shall first come and restore
[40:59] all things now here you have the
[41:02] fullness of the word standing here
[41:04] the the promise of genesis 3 is standing
[41:07] on earth
[41:08] he's right here the fullness of the word
[41:10] that's coming for redemption
[41:11] but yet he knows that something else has
[41:14] to happen in the plan of redemption
[41:16] and though he's the promise of genesis 3
[41:18] genesis 3 is not going to be finished
[41:20] genesis 3 is going to finish later
[41:27] what prophecy brought your redemption
[41:29] genesis 3
[41:31] when was it made manifest to you 2000
[41:33] years ago no now
[41:35] it's being made manifest right now we're
[41:37] in genesis 3.
[41:39] hallelujah hallelujah
[41:42] nothing ever changes or fades away in
[41:44] the word it just keeps working on down
[41:46] so now jesus is here and he's saying
[41:49] amen
[41:50] he is come he is god in flesh
[41:53] he is the word made flesh and he's going
[41:56] to give his life to pay the price of
[41:58] redemption
[41:59] to buy back all that's been lost oh that
[42:01] had been
[42:02] and all that will be lost he's there but
[42:04] yet while he's there
[42:06] he's saying there's an elias that shall
[42:08] first come
[42:09] and restore all things he's laying down
[42:11] a prophecy that something's going to
[42:13] happen
[42:14] and there's going to be a need for a
[42:15] further restoration
[42:19] because remember john the baptist came
[42:21] to prepare a way not to restore
[42:24] he came to prepare the way of the lord
[42:25] but he never came to restore anything
[42:27] back
[42:28] because the only thing he could restore
[42:29] was back to the law of moses and they
[42:31] don't want to go back to the law
[42:32] they're moving to grace so he prepared a
[42:34] way for grace to come
[42:36] but after grace come they're going to
[42:38] fall away amen and there has to come an
[42:40] elias
[42:40] and elijah that will restore back
[42:46] so jesus on earth the fullness of this
[42:48] promise
[42:49] is now saying it's not finished we're
[42:51] going to be restored back
[42:54] hallelujah now god
[42:58] promised spiritual eve at pentecost pay
[43:00] close attention now
[43:02] god told spiritual evil pentecost told
[43:04] her even before it happened now he's not
[43:06] talking about the pentecostal revival
[43:08] from 1906 he's talking about when
[43:10] pentecost fell
[43:11] on the early disciples back in the book
[43:13] of acts god promised spiritual eve
[43:16] at pentecost told her even before it
[43:18] happened
[43:19] 400 years before the church ever fell
[43:21] that they would fall away
[43:22] and they would do what they've done but
[43:24] he promised in the last
[43:26] excuse me in the last days he would send
[43:28] the word again
[43:30] now remember when he promised the woman
[43:32] in genesis 3 that he would send the word
[43:34] the word came for one reason and one
[43:36] reason only
[43:37] that was for redemption and now
[43:40] he's speaking to the the pentecostal
[43:42] church and jesus
[43:44] is saying elijah shall first come and
[43:46] restore all things
[43:47] because he knows there's going to be a
[43:48] need for a restoration
[43:51] all things had come
[43:54] all things had come amen the word had
[43:58] come in full measure the word had given
[44:00] its life
[44:00] now the the person of the word and the
[44:02] holy ghost had come upon the church
[44:04] all things had come
[44:08] but yet jesus knew that there would have
[44:10] to come something to restore
[44:13] because people would lose hold of
[44:15] redemption
[44:18] hallelujah so where does he give this
[44:22] promise in pentecost
[44:26] acts chapter 3 verse 19 says peter
[44:30] says repent ye therefore and be
[44:32] converted that your sins may be blotted
[44:33] out
[44:34] when the times of refreshing shall come
[44:36] from the presence of the lord
[44:38] and he shall send jesus christ which
[44:40] before
[44:41] was priests unto you whom the heavens
[44:43] must receive
[44:44] until the times of restitution of all
[44:48] things
[44:49] that word restitution means restoration
[44:52] so now he's saying jesus christ had
[44:55] already come
[44:56] amen the spirit of god had already
[44:58] returned amen the church had already
[45:00] come to life
[45:01] but yet he's already laying a prophecy
[45:03] down right here in acts chapter 3
[45:06] saying that the the heavens must receive
[45:08] jesus christ
[45:10] amen until the times of restitution of
[45:13] all things
[45:14] which god has spoken by the mouth of his
[45:16] holy prophet since
[45:17] the world began
[45:21] this prophecy has been going since the
[45:23] world began
[45:25] and this is a prophecy in genesis
[45:26] chapter 3 that the seed of the woman
[45:29] shall bruise the head of the serpent
[45:32] so here in acts he's already saying
[45:36] there must come a restitution
[45:39] jesus christ must be received in the
[45:40] heavens until
[45:42] the restitution of all things that's why
[45:46] it's so important that you catch the
[45:48] sign of his coming
[45:51] because he must be received into the
[45:53] heavens until the restitution of all
[45:55] things
[45:56] until the time that the prophecy in
[45:58] genesis 3 is going to finally be
[46:01] fulfilled
[46:02] amen there must be a all things have
[46:04] come
[46:05] but we're going to fall away from all
[46:07] things and there must be a restitution
[46:09] back to it and that's why when we see
[46:12] the sign of his coming in the cloud
[46:14] there
[46:14] we see brother brahman said what is that
[46:17] he said that's our lord up there
[46:21] what is this it's the time for the
[46:24] restitution of all things
[46:28] this is genesis 3 all over again
[46:31] friends
[46:35] it says now here we are at the end time
[46:37] and spiritual eve just as hebrew eve was
[46:39] promised
[46:40] the hebrew bride was promised the word
[46:42] would return and a spiritual bride from
[46:44] pentecost
[46:45] when she fell at nicaea she promised in
[46:48] the last days that the word would come
[46:49] again
[46:50] if you want another scripture take take
[46:52] over here revelations 10
[46:54] and the hour and the time of the last
[46:56] angel the seventh angel
[46:58] seventh messenger begins to sound the
[47:00] mystery of god is finished
[47:01] the restoration back to the word
[47:07] the bible said that his messenger of the
[47:09] last days would be
[47:11] restore them back to the original faith
[47:14] again
[47:14] back to the faith of the fathers
[47:21] what are we going back to we're going
[47:24] back to the promise of genesis 3 the
[47:27] seed of the woman
[47:29] we've got to be brought back to the
[47:31] fullness of the word again
[47:33] the fullness of the word coming in flesh
[47:35] we've got to be restored back again
[47:38] how many believes that that's the
[47:41] restoration or the restitution of all
[47:43] things
[47:43] that's when elias shall come and restore
[47:46] all things
[47:47] what we've come to now is friends we've
[47:50] come to not
[47:51] just a prophet showing up and doing
[47:53] miracles and signs it's not that
[47:55] it's bringing us back to the prophecy at
[47:57] the fall when the
[47:58] at the fall when he said the seed of the
[48:00] woman shall come and bruise the head of
[48:02] the serpent
[48:02] and now the seed of the woman came and
[48:04] the fullness of a body called jesus
[48:06] christ
[48:07] and when he comes now he's saying but
[48:09] eli shall come and restore all things
[48:11] because he's got to lay down his life
[48:13] and he knows that that
[48:14] that that natural eve
[48:18] the woman in the garden she fell from
[48:20] the word
[48:22] then he started hebrew eve right
[48:26] and hebrew eve did the same thing that
[48:28] natural eve did
[48:29] the hebrew church fell from the word
[48:32] and now the pattern is set the pattern
[48:34] is set the pattern is set
[48:36] so now spiritual eve at pentecost is
[48:39] going to do the same thing
[48:41] she's going to fall by the word and the
[48:44] only way to restore
[48:45] the woman in the beginning the only way
[48:47] that she could be restored
[48:49] was to receive the seed of the woman
[48:51] amen and the only way that we can be
[48:53] restored
[48:54] is to receive the same thing the
[48:56] fullness of the word
[48:59] so the word comes for one reason and
[49:01] that's for redemption
[49:04] it didn't come to make us excited it
[49:06] didn't come for a show
[49:08] it came for redemption
[49:12] hallelujah
[49:15] brother branham said when he come the
[49:18] word that he had promised come for the
[49:20] wedding
[49:23] he found her wrapped in her substitute
[49:25] so bad
[49:26] that she wouldn't take the real promise
[49:28] that had been made
[49:29] the word christ so when he come to the
[49:32] hebrew church
[49:33] they had been given substitutes until
[49:35] the time that this promised seed would
[49:37] come
[49:38] and when the promised seed would come
[49:39] the substitutes were to be done away
[49:41] with because now the lamb is here
[49:42] we don't need a substitutionary lamb now
[49:45] the lamb of god is here
[49:46] but they so enjoyed the substitutionary
[49:49] system
[49:49] and it becomes such a tradition and so
[49:51] entrenched that now when the lamb
[49:53] himself come
[49:54] they wanted to stay with the substitutes
[49:57] and they rejected the true lamb of god
[50:02] maybe you don't get it let me go over it
[50:04] again i want you to get this she was
[50:05] promised the bride eve to be a redeemer
[50:08] her redeemer would be the word and when
[50:10] the word came made flesh she rejected it
[50:13] she was given substitutes given
[50:16] substitutes to go on until the redeemer
[50:17] came
[50:18] and when the redeemer came she wanted to
[50:20] continue with her substitute
[50:21] and rejected the true word and that was
[50:24] the hebrew bride
[50:26] god promised the spiritual eve as same
[50:29] as he did natural eve that again
[50:31] the word would be restored to her in the
[50:34] last days
[50:35] he would restore it the church to the
[50:37] original word again
[50:40] so now we find out when when god kept
[50:43] his word from genesis 3
[50:44] and he brought the seed that came
[50:46] through the woman he brought it in
[50:48] a human form called jesus christ and
[50:50] that was the word
[50:51] made flesh that was the full measure of
[50:54] the word of god
[50:55] standing on earth and flesh and it had
[50:58] to come as a human being
[50:59] so that it could be slain and shed the
[51:01] blood which is the price of redemption
[51:03] to buy back
[51:04] all of that seed but when it came
[51:07] they were so used to what they had been
[51:09] given to hold on to until that time
[51:12] amen that they wanted to keep what they
[51:14] had and not take the promise of genesis
[51:16] 3.
[51:18] and for them they missed out on
[51:19] redemption
[51:21] the same thing has happened today the
[51:24] same things happened today
[51:26] now now the full word comes he displays
[51:29] the life
[51:29] he sheds his blood and that life of that
[51:32] blood excuse me the life that was in
[51:34] jesus christ
[51:34] comes back into the church now the
[51:37] church has all things amen
[51:38] they've got the full word of god they've
[51:40] got the life of god on the inside
[51:42] they've come to redemption amen but they
[51:44] would fall away from that place
[51:46] and they would begin to do what the
[51:48] first eve did and when the first eve
[51:50] fell away
[51:50] amen she fell away from the word now
[51:53] this eve is going to fall away from the
[51:55] word by compromising on the word
[51:56] by changing the word by taking creeds
[51:59] and dogmas instead of the word
[52:00] and now she's going to fall away and god
[52:03] would allow
[52:04] that system to go and he had a covering
[52:07] for that system
[52:09] and he was called the kinsman redeemer
[52:11] back behind the throne
[52:12] laying seven stripes of blood to cover
[52:15] the ignorance of the people
[52:16] but god god's desire was not for people
[52:19] to remain in ignorance
[52:21] god's desire was for the promise of
[52:23] genesis 3 to come to fulfillment
[52:25] amen god didn't want a bride that was
[52:28] stuck in
[52:29] ignorance he didn't want a bride that
[52:30] had to be covered for he wanted a bride
[52:32] to come to the full life of jesus christ
[52:35] to the full measure of the word that was
[52:37] his purpose so he had laid down a
[52:38] prophecy before she would ever fall from
[52:41] the word
[52:44] that jesus christ must be received in
[52:45] the heavens until the restitution of all
[52:48] things
[52:49] as spoken of by all the holy prophets
[52:52] since the beginning of the world
[52:55] friends here we are all prophecy from
[52:59] the beginning of the world has been
[53:00] speaking about
[53:01] this coming word
[53:06] what did it come for for redemption
[53:11] brother brahm says in the message the
[53:13] token now remember
[53:15] i'm still just laying a foundation so
[53:17] pay close attention
[53:19] you guys are good students just don't
[53:22] sleep on me or you have to come sing a
[53:23] special
[53:25] if i catch you singing you got to come
[53:26] sing a special and i'll play the piano
[53:29] for you
[53:32] that should keep everybody awake
[53:35] and remember israel came through many
[53:38] things but it was in the evening time
[53:40] when the token was required
[53:42] not in the morning not in the
[53:44] preparation
[53:45] not the 14 days of keeping up the lamb
[53:47] israel knowed something was coming
[53:50] so did luther know so did wesley know it
[53:53] so did finney knox calvin noah this is
[53:56] it
[53:56] they knew there would come a time that
[53:58] the pillar of fire would return back to
[54:00] the church
[54:00] they know there would come a time that
[54:02] these things would happen but they
[54:04] didn't live to see it
[54:05] but they looked forward to it so brother
[54:07] remembers referring now to the token
[54:09] he's talking about
[54:10] the passover amen and the passover feast
[54:13] in egypt they were they were
[54:14] taken to take a lamb they were hold up
[54:16] the lamb and and
[54:18] when they found the lamb had no blemish
[54:20] there was no sickness they found that it
[54:21] was a perfect lamb
[54:22] then they would slay the lamb and
[54:24] collect the blood then after they
[54:26] collected the blood
[54:27] in the evening time they were to take
[54:29] that blood and they would apply it to
[54:31] the little and the doorpost
[54:32] to show that this house is under the
[54:35] blood of a lamb
[54:37] that that blood that's on display is the
[54:40] token
[54:41] now listen the blood is not the token
[54:46] you got to catch this you could have
[54:48] killed the lamb and put it in a bucket
[54:50] and had it sitting beside
[54:52] the door and when the death angel came
[54:53] the death angel would enter in and smite
[54:55] the firstborn of that house
[54:57] because that wasn't the token amen the
[54:59] token was the life on display
[55:03] the blood represents the life and when
[55:05] that was painted so
[55:06] all the world could see that this house
[55:09] is under the token
[55:10] this house is under the life of the lamb
[55:12] and the life of the lamb is on display
[55:15] that's the token and that token was not
[55:18] to be on display
[55:19] until the evening time and until the
[55:23] evening time they were just to keep up
[55:25] the lamb
[55:26] all right watch the lamb see that it's a
[55:28] perfect lamb
[55:29] there's nothing wrong with the lamb the
[55:31] lamb doesn't limp it doesn't have an
[55:32] injury there's not a blemish
[55:34] on it and when they find that the lamb
[55:35] is perfect then they slay the lamb
[55:38] and after they slay the lamb then they
[55:40] take the blood
[55:41] and they put the blood on display and
[55:44] and
[55:45] you know all of israel was forbidden in
[55:46] leviticus to ever eat the blood of an
[55:48] animal
[55:49] because the scripture says the life is
[55:51] in the blood
[55:52] so this blood represents the life that
[55:54] was in the animal amen
[55:56] and in the evening time there's got to
[55:58] be this perfect lamb that's been held up
[56:01] how long has it been held up it's been
[56:03] held up amen
[56:04] it's been held up for two sabbaths
[56:08] because it's the word friends it's the
[56:09] word it's the word
[56:11] it's the word when jesus christ came
[56:14] you say he was a man he was the word
[56:16] made flesh it was the word
[56:19] it was the word that bled it was the
[56:21] word that died it was the blood of the
[56:23] word
[56:25] so brother branham said the old
[56:27] testament in the new testament are two
[56:29] sabbaths
[56:31] so the lamb has been held up through two
[56:33] sabbaths amen
[56:34] the word has been shown now from the old
[56:37] testament through the new testament
[56:39] now we've found that the lamb is perfect
[56:41] amen it's without blemish there's no
[56:43] fault
[56:44] in it it doesn't limp it doesn't halt
[56:46] there's not a spot on it we found out
[56:47] this word is perfect amen
[56:49] and then in the evening time by the
[56:51] evening time messenger
[56:53] he would take and put that lamb on full
[56:55] display and what would the priest of the
[56:57] day do they would take the lamb and they
[56:59] would crucify it a second time
[57:01] spilling the blood of the word
[57:04] the pattern set it has to continue
[57:07] that's why brother branham would come
[57:08] along and preach indictment he said i
[57:10] indict this generation for the second
[57:12] crucifixion of jesus christ
[57:14] and then people are like you're crazy
[57:16] how did we crucify him
[57:18] because he is the word
[57:21] and when the word came back in full
[57:23] measure and the seals were open
[57:25] and it was rejected by the clergy
[57:27] worldwide that was the second
[57:28] crucifixion of jesus christ
[57:30] and now that blood was collected and now
[57:33] there's a life that comes with that
[57:34] and that life has to be on display
[57:38] in the evening time what is it
[57:41] it's the life amen that was in the
[57:43] sacrifice
[57:44] now has to be on display over your house
[57:48] showing that your house was has been
[57:50] paid for has been redeemed
[57:52] by the life that was in that sacrifice
[57:54] and now when you live the life
[57:56] of the word which is the life of jesus
[57:58] christ when you see the word and you
[58:00] line to that word
[58:01] without making excuses amen without
[58:04] compromising on it but when something
[58:06] in you this is a spirit of god wants to
[58:08] live every word
[58:10] every jot every tittle every line every
[58:13] everything that was taught and
[58:14] everything that was said that brings the
[58:16] life on display
[58:18] showing that the word has bled for me
[58:21] the word has died
[58:22] for me and now i have the token evidence
[58:25] that a perfect lamb has died for me
[58:29] without the token life there's no
[58:31] evidence that the
[58:32] you may have seen a perfect lamb you may
[58:35] have seen the slaying of the perfect
[58:37] lamb
[58:37] but until you take that blood and you
[58:40] paint it over your house their token is
[58:43] not applied
[58:44] the death angel will march right in and
[58:47] he could go right past that bucket of
[58:49] blood
[58:51] he could walk right past the bucket of
[58:53] blood once he gets in
[58:55] he can see the charred remains amen of
[58:57] the lamb
[58:58] but if there's nothing on display over
[59:01] the house
[59:02] there's nothing to keep the death angel
[59:03] out
[59:05] we've come to the time friends amen
[59:08] brother bam said the message isn't just
[59:10] to be talked about
[59:12] it's to be on display it's to be lived
[59:17] what life it's the life of jesus christ
[59:20] what life is that
[59:21] jesus christ is the word
[59:25] so the life of the word has to be on
[59:28] display
[59:31] hallelujah when
[59:35] in the evening time through seven church
[59:38] ages
[59:39] been holding up the lamb proving it's a
[59:42] perfect lamb
[59:44] proving the word never fails showing
[59:47] through the restoration coming through
[59:49] luther coming through wesley
[59:50] coming through pentecost showing that
[59:52] it's a good lamb there's nothing wrong
[59:54] with the lamb
[59:55] but in the evening time the token must
[59:58] be on display
[1:00:02] israel knew something was coming but it
[1:00:04] was in the evening time
[1:00:06] this is out of the token message
[1:00:10] it was in the evening time when the
[1:00:11] lamb's blood the token was placed on the
[1:00:14] on the door yet the lamb was already put
[1:00:16] up
[1:00:18] now listen close it's been the lamb
[1:00:21] all the way through remember the lamb
[1:00:24] remember this is the word of god
[1:00:27] it's been the lamb all the way through
[1:00:30] it was the lamb and luther's time
[1:00:32] it was the lamb in wesley's time but now
[1:00:35] is token time something's changed
[1:00:39] marking that we've come to the evening
[1:00:41] time
[1:00:43] because it was the lamb and luther's
[1:00:45] time it was the lamb in wesley's time
[1:00:47] see there wasn't the evening time yet
[1:00:49] they couldn't display the life
[1:00:51] that's why luther could smoke and curse
[1:00:53] and persecute the jews and he was
[1:00:54] absolutely fine because the lamb was
[1:00:56] back there
[1:00:57] laying down seven stripes to cover the
[1:00:59] ignorance the full word hadn't been
[1:01:01] opened
[1:01:01] and luther couldn't know those things so
[1:01:03] now he couldn't have the token on
[1:01:05] display
[1:01:07] brother branham said all those seven
[1:01:08] ages had a dip in the holy ghost a dip
[1:01:10] in the holy ghost a dip in the holy
[1:01:12] but now we've come to the full measure
[1:01:13] of the holy ghost which
[1:01:15] is the life that was in that lamb
[1:01:19] hallelujah friends it's available
[1:01:23] it's here it's token time
[1:01:28] it's time for the life of the word to be
[1:01:30] on display
[1:01:32] amen over his house and his house is his
[1:01:35] body
[1:01:36] his church
[1:01:40] it was the lamb all the way through it
[1:01:42] was the lamb and luther's time it was
[1:01:43] the lamb in wesley's time
[1:01:45] but now this marks a transition
[1:01:49] but now you can't go the denominational
[1:01:52] way it's not going to work anymore
[1:01:55] you can't go with a partial life lived
[1:01:58] it won't work anymore because the
[1:02:00] partial life lived
[1:02:01] it can only work when there was
[1:02:03] something back there behind the throne
[1:02:05] laying
[1:02:06] down seven stripes of blood to cover for
[1:02:08] ignorance
[1:02:09] but now that the full word has come
[1:02:11] there's no covering for ignorance
[1:02:13] because the word is here
[1:02:16] so now it's become we've transitioned
[1:02:18] from the
[1:02:19] from the time that that that ignorance
[1:02:21] would be winked at and luther's age and
[1:02:23] ignorance would be
[1:02:24] winked out in wesley's days but now
[1:02:26] ignorance is no longer going to be
[1:02:27] winked at because there's no excuse
[1:02:29] because the full word has come and it's
[1:02:31] been so thoroughly vindicated you can't
[1:02:34] deny that this is the word god himself
[1:02:37] proved this is the word
[1:02:38] he proved it night after night after
[1:02:40] night on the platform through signs
[1:02:42] on miraculous things that we could we
[1:02:44] could go on for days talking about the
[1:02:46] vindication of the word
[1:02:48] amen but but the vindication of the word
[1:02:50] was only to prove that this lamb is now
[1:02:52] here
[1:02:53] the seed of the woman has come amen it's
[1:02:55] been rejected a second time
[1:02:57] and now it's token time it's time to
[1:02:59] take that life and put it on display for
[1:03:01] the world to sing
[1:03:03] so you can't it doesn't work anymore to
[1:03:06] say you know
[1:03:07] i i just have a bunch of struggles you
[1:03:10] know i just
[1:03:10] there's no time for that anymore it's
[1:03:12] token time we're not
[1:03:14] under luther's day amen the lamb has
[1:03:16] been slain
[1:03:17] we're not under coverings for ignorance
[1:03:19] anymore once we realize that this
[1:03:21] is wrong now we've got to get on our
[1:03:23] face and say god
[1:03:24] i realize by your word that when i'm
[1:03:27] living my life
[1:03:28] isn't matching your word and god the
[1:03:30] token must be on display
[1:03:32] i need something more than i have right
[1:03:34] now i need you to come
[1:03:36] by the baptism holy ghost and burn that
[1:03:38] out of my life and you live your life
[1:03:40] through me
[1:03:41] amen it's not something you can do
[1:03:43] yourself but when you recognize it
[1:03:45] in desperation desperation always calls
[1:03:47] god on the scene
[1:03:48] don't ever sit there and think well it's
[1:03:50] okay to compromise a little bit
[1:03:52] god knows my heart yeah god knows
[1:03:54] exactly what's in your heart man's heart
[1:03:58] is deceitfully wicked who can know it
[1:04:00] you could sit there and deceive we could
[1:04:02] deceive ourselves thinking
[1:04:04] well you know it's just a little of this
[1:04:05] and it's just a little of that friends
[1:04:07] it's not holding up the lamb time
[1:04:09] anymore this is token time
[1:04:11] the death angels on the march amen we're
[1:04:13] coming to a time
[1:04:14] to the showdown time and only that life
[1:04:17] on display is going
[1:04:18] in it's time to come to desperation and
[1:04:22] say god
[1:04:22] i'm not toting the line and i seem to
[1:04:24] have no power to
[1:04:26] overcome amen i need the life that was
[1:04:28] in the blood that was shed at calvary
[1:04:30] i need that life to come in me to make a
[1:04:33] token display
[1:04:34] to make sure i'm safe there's no other
[1:04:38] way
[1:04:42] it was okay for luther to drink and
[1:04:45] smoke and swear and
[1:04:46] persecute jews it was okay
[1:04:50] for wesley to skip out on the baptism of
[1:04:53] the holy ghost
[1:04:54] it was okay in those days for certain
[1:04:57] things
[1:04:58] because it hadn't been revealed yet but
[1:05:01] it's not okay today
[1:05:06] that should put us all into desperation
[1:05:10] i should put every one of us on our face
[1:05:12] every day saying lord
[1:05:13] you've called for nothing less than the
[1:05:16] life of jesus christ to be on display
[1:05:22] what did it friends the word is returned
[1:05:28] the word is returned the seed of the
[1:05:31] woman
[1:05:32] is here the promise
[1:05:36] of the fathers is here
[1:05:40] he said in joel joel chapter 2 verse 23
[1:05:45] be glad then you children of zion and
[1:05:47] rejoice in the lord for your god
[1:05:50] for he hath given you the former rain
[1:05:52] moderately and he will cause to come
[1:05:54] down for you the rain
[1:05:55] the former rain and the latter rain in
[1:05:58] the first month
[1:05:59] a time when the former and latter reign
[1:06:01] would fall together
[1:06:04] and the floor shall be full of wheat and
[1:06:05] the fat shall overflow with
[1:06:08] wine and oil amen we've come to the time
[1:06:12] when the floors are full of wheat and
[1:06:15] the vats
[1:06:16] do overflow with wine and oil
[1:06:19] and i will restore to you the years that
[1:06:21] the locust hath eaten the canker worm
[1:06:23] and the caterpillar
[1:06:24] and the palmer were my great army which
[1:06:26] i sent unto you
[1:06:28] and you shall eat plenty and be
[1:06:29] satisfied and praise the name of the
[1:06:31] lord your god
[1:06:32] that hath dealt wondrously with you and
[1:06:34] my people shall never
[1:06:35] be ashamed and you shall know that i am
[1:06:39] in the midst of israel and that i am the
[1:06:40] lord your god
[1:06:41] and none else and my people shall never
[1:06:44] be
[1:06:45] ashamed when when he restores
[1:06:48] back all that the caterpillar the canker
[1:06:50] worm the palmer worm and the locust has
[1:06:52] eaten
[1:06:53] when he restored back the bride tree and
[1:06:55] will never be ashamed again
[1:06:58] hallelujah
[1:07:03] in the fourth seal early in the fourth
[1:07:06] seal
[1:07:06] brother brahm tells another story and i
[1:07:09] think we've learned by now that these
[1:07:10] stories should get our attention
[1:07:13] when he begins to break down a story all
[1:07:15] of a sudden
[1:07:16] antennas go up and we're like wha what's
[1:07:18] this all about
[1:07:20] and brother adam the seventh seal he
[1:07:22] draws our attention to something
[1:07:24] he said i'm sure that you've noticed
[1:07:27] that the things that's been happening
[1:07:28] this week
[1:07:29] i'm sure you noticed that the little
[1:07:31] collins boy laying there dying the other
[1:07:33] night
[1:07:33] that little leukemia girl the kingdom of
[1:07:36] god is coming
[1:07:37] now brother van points to a couple
[1:07:39] healings that had taken place that week
[1:07:41] and he said i'm sure you've noticed the
[1:07:43] little collins boy lying there dying the
[1:07:45] other night
[1:07:45] and that little leukemia girl he points
[1:07:47] to two things
[1:07:48] and then he says the kingdom of god is
[1:07:51] coming and it's becoming more from
[1:07:53] negative to positive
[1:07:54] as it has been now that ought to choke
[1:07:56] people from justification to
[1:07:58] sanctification to the battle of the holy
[1:08:00] ghost
[1:08:00] and then here here see we're just
[1:08:03] drawing closer to god
[1:08:05] all the time
[1:08:14] in the fourth seal paragraph seven he's
[1:08:16] starting very early in the seal he
[1:08:17] starts talking about a story
[1:08:19] she noticed when he showed himself to
[1:08:21] daniel in the vision there'd be a
[1:08:22] representation of one king
[1:08:24] like a goat in this place or maybe a
[1:08:26] tree in next place it would be a statue
[1:08:28] things he's just making the same thing
[1:08:29] all the time just be sure that we don't
[1:08:31] miss it
[1:08:31] he's showing types and shadows and i was
[1:08:34] certainly thrilled just a few moments
[1:08:36] ago talking to a little lady sitting
[1:08:37] here
[1:08:38] about 85 years old and she before i let
[1:08:41] before i went to go west why there was a
[1:08:43] little girl up in ohio
[1:08:44] that was i think so that was dying with
[1:08:46] last stage of leukemia
[1:08:49] now leukemia is cancer in the blood
[1:08:52] now remember brother branham in the
[1:08:53] seventh seal drew our attention to two
[1:08:55] cases the collins boy
[1:08:57] and the leukemia girl now look leukemia
[1:09:00] is cancer in the bloodstream
[1:09:05] friends we've had cancer in the
[1:09:06] bloodstream
[1:09:09] since the fall in the garden of eden
[1:09:10] there's been a problem with the
[1:09:12] bloodstream amen
[1:09:14] but yet there's something that has to
[1:09:16] come back there has to come a blood that
[1:09:18] will fix the problem in the blood
[1:09:21] why was it jesus had to be virgin born
[1:09:23] why was it there had to be shedding of
[1:09:24] blood for the remission of sins
[1:09:26] because the cancer was in the blood so
[1:09:29] now brother ben i'm right in the fourth
[1:09:31] right in the fourth seal because the
[1:09:33] four seal friends is the wrap
[1:09:34] up of the gentile dispensations the
[1:09:37] fourth seal is the finishing of the
[1:09:39] church ages
[1:09:40] the fourth seal will take the church all
[1:09:42] the way into the rapture
[1:09:43] and then lucifer will come down himself
[1:09:45] the devil will inject himself into the
[1:09:47] beast
[1:09:48] and ride out the tribulation so right in
[1:09:50] the for seal
[1:09:51] everything wraps up in the fourth seal
[1:09:53] for the bride
[1:09:55] we got that so the four seal he's
[1:09:57] talking about
[1:09:58] there's leukemia it's cancer in the
[1:10:00] bloodstream oh the little thing was you
[1:10:02] know such an
[1:10:03] awful condition that there was no more
[1:10:05] hope for her at all
[1:10:06] they were feeding her by the veins the
[1:10:08] operation and so there was real poor
[1:10:10] family
[1:10:11] brother kid they told them about the
[1:10:13] lord answering prayer so much and they
[1:10:14] got together i think and hired someone
[1:10:16] and brought the little girl down
[1:10:17] and she was a very pretty little girl
[1:10:19] about six or seven or nine years old and
[1:10:21] she was
[1:10:22] back there in the room and when we went
[1:10:23] before the lord the holy spirit gave
[1:10:25] a word to her and they had to take her
[1:10:28] and have to
[1:10:29] they had to take her and they have to
[1:10:30] take her and feed her you know
[1:10:32] that way through the veins and when she
[1:10:35] left she was crying for a hamburger
[1:10:38] and so taking her food by mouth and they
[1:10:40] gave her the hamburger
[1:10:41] and just went ahead feeding her natural
[1:10:45] in short time a few days they'd taken
[1:10:47] her back to the doctor
[1:10:48] and they the doctor just simply couldn't
[1:10:50] understand he said like it
[1:10:52] even wasn't even the same girl said why
[1:10:54] there's not even one
[1:10:55] trace of leukemia about it nowhere
[1:10:58] nowhere
[1:10:58] at all and she was dying they done give
[1:11:01] her up just feeding her through the
[1:11:03] veins she had done turned yellow you
[1:11:04] know how they get
[1:11:05] so she was already pale she was already
[1:11:08] in the pale horse
[1:11:11] so now she's at school playing with the
[1:11:13] other children just as happy as she can
[1:11:14] be
[1:11:17] that's the leukemia girl now let's read
[1:11:18] about the collins boy
[1:11:20] he picks the story up in detail in the
[1:11:22] fifth seal he says now i've got a
[1:11:24] testimony that i'd like to give
[1:11:26] i heard it i could i could be that that
[1:11:28] i'm wrong i think the people are here
[1:11:29] that testimony applies to
[1:11:31] then a few days ago
[1:11:35] you know a few days ago when i was at my
[1:11:37] home now in arizona i got a call that
[1:11:39] said there was a little boy that had
[1:11:40] rheumatic fever and that goes to the
[1:11:42] heart
[1:11:43] so he's got a problem with the heart we
[1:11:44] find out later it was rheumatic fever in
[1:11:46] his bloodstream
[1:11:48] see the two cases brother branham points
[1:11:50] to
[1:11:51] and the seventh seal one leukemia cancer
[1:11:55] in the blood
[1:11:55] one rheumatic fever disease in the blood
[1:11:58] and it's affecting his heart
[1:12:02] but under the fourth seal there's going
[1:12:03] to be something that's going to fix the
[1:12:04] blood
[1:12:07] listen i'll just love what the prophet
[1:12:09] says just listen
[1:12:13] his father and mother are such darling
[1:12:15] precious friends of mine as one of our
[1:12:16] deacons here
[1:12:17] church brother collins his little boy
[1:12:19] little mikey
[1:12:20] was suffering with romantic fever of the
[1:12:22] heart and the doctors had sent him home
[1:12:24] put him in the bed and told the parents
[1:12:26] not even to let him up nor raise him up
[1:12:27] and take a drink of water but take it
[1:12:29] out of a straw he was so bad
[1:12:31] and the parents faithful come to the
[1:12:32] tabernacle here and believes
[1:12:34] a few nights ago we'd announced healing
[1:12:37] service on sunday but seeing that we're
[1:12:39] going to have to answer questions
[1:12:41] so then we had to admit the healing
[1:12:43] service then i had a little something
[1:12:44] that i've been keeping in my
[1:12:46] in the inside of my heart and the mother
[1:12:48] and father wanted to know if they could
[1:12:49] bring the child to the room
[1:12:50] and they brought the little fellow out
[1:12:52] there and the holy spirit pronounced him
[1:12:55] healed and so the parents being
[1:12:57] respected that taken the little fellow
[1:12:58] home and sent him to school
[1:13:00] just sent him on to school the doctors
[1:13:02] got a hold of it so the doctors wasn't
[1:13:04] very well pleased with such a thing so
[1:13:06] he told the mother that the baby should
[1:13:07] be in bed of course and she'd give him
[1:13:09] the story
[1:13:10] and i think the man i understand is a
[1:13:11] christian believer by the nomination a
[1:13:13] seventh day adventist
[1:13:14] the doctor is so it's time he said it's
[1:13:17] time for the child to be examined
[1:13:18] so you ought at least to have it
[1:13:20] examined she said very well
[1:13:21] took the child down and the doctor
[1:13:23] examined it the blood where the
[1:13:25] rheumatic fever lays
[1:13:27] and so i understand that the doctor was
[1:13:28] so amazed he didn't know what to do
[1:13:30] the little boy is perfectly normal sound
[1:13:33] and well
[1:13:34] now is the comments here might have told
[1:13:36] that wrong is that right sister collins
[1:13:38] yep that's little mikey collins just
[1:13:39] about six seven years old
[1:13:41] and what happened right in that room
[1:13:42] about three nights ago oh there had to
[1:13:44] be somebody in that room besides human
[1:13:46] beings
[1:13:47] it was the great mighty jehovah that's
[1:13:49] right that comes to honor his word and
[1:13:51] i'm so grateful
[1:13:52] to hear that so here we've got the
[1:13:56] collins boy and and in the seventh seal
[1:13:59] brother ben's now said did you
[1:14:00] notice what's been happening this week
[1:14:02] you see that colin's boy and that
[1:14:03] leukemia girl
[1:14:04] the kingdom of god has come the kingdom
[1:14:07] of god is coming
[1:14:09] and he gives a little bit of detail here
[1:14:11] that i want to i want to hone in on on
[1:14:13] the fifth seal
[1:14:14] it says two or three days after that in
[1:14:16] school we went to doctor and the doctor
[1:14:18] was so amazed
[1:14:19] he said there's not even one trace of
[1:14:20] leukemia found in the child brother
[1:14:22] is referring back to the same stories we
[1:14:24] just talked about
[1:14:26] found in the child now that's
[1:14:28] instantaneously
[1:14:29] on the mark the power of almighty god to
[1:14:32] take a bloodstream and cleanse it out
[1:14:34] right like that and put the pulsation of
[1:14:36] new life back in there
[1:14:38] because your bloodstream is your life
[1:14:41] mortal and create new cells and clean
[1:14:44] out the old and what is it
[1:14:45] it's absolutely i say this it's a
[1:14:47] creative act of the almighty god to take
[1:14:49] a bloodstream that's contaminated with
[1:14:51] cancer
[1:14:52] and to the little fellow yellow and
[1:14:53] puffed out and within just a few moments
[1:14:55] time
[1:14:56] a brand new bloodstream
[1:15:02] hallelujah
[1:15:05] natural types of spiritual here comes
[1:15:08] brother branham and the seals and he
[1:15:09] gets through the force
[1:15:10] he starts talking about this leukemia
[1:15:12] girl and he's trying to draw your
[1:15:13] attention to something
[1:15:14] that there's disease in the blood amen
[1:15:17] this boy with rheumatic fever
[1:15:18] it's affecting his heart he's got the
[1:15:20] rheumatic fever in the blood but here in
[1:15:22] just a moment's time
[1:15:24] there's a god on the scene that can
[1:15:25] totally change a contaminated
[1:15:27] bloodstream
[1:15:28] and make a new bloodstream and friends i
[1:15:30] tell you there's a god on the scene

[1:15:35] that can change your contaminated
[1:15:37] bloodstream that old life that you used
[1:15:39] to live
[1:15:40] that hybridization he can change it and
[1:15:42] give you a brand new blood transfusion
[1:15:45] with the blood of the life of jesus
[1:15:47] christ
[1:15:48] what did it the opening of the word it
[1:15:51] brought it brought the promised seed
[1:15:53] the son of god jesus christ back again
[1:15:58] to do what to change your contaminated
[1:16:01] blood life
[1:16:04] come to the world with you've got cancer
[1:16:06] in your blood
[1:16:08] or you may have nothing wrong with your
[1:16:09] physical blood but that life that's in
[1:16:12] you is contaminated amen that natural
[1:16:14] life that you've lived in this natural
[1:16:16] body
[1:16:16] it's cancer ridden it's got rheumatic
[1:16:18] fever and it's affecting
[1:16:20] your heart but there's a god amen
[1:16:24] there's a god because the kingdom's
[1:16:25] coming down
[1:16:26] but there's a god who wants to give you
[1:16:27] a blood transfusion he wants in a
[1:16:30] moment's time
[1:16:31] to clean out the bloodstream and give
[1:16:33] you new blood cells
[1:16:35] the life of jesus christ we're not
[1:16:38] living in luther's day it's not wesley's
[1:16:41] day
[1:16:41] it's not even the falling of the gifts
[1:16:43] in pentecost this is the person of the
[1:16:45] holy ghost himself
[1:16:46] come down to eject his life into your
[1:16:49] life to purify that old life
[1:16:51] and give you the life of jesus christ
[1:16:53] and that life
[1:16:54] is the token in this day and without
[1:16:57] that life
[1:16:58] you're susceptible to the death age
[1:17:03] hallelujah
[1:17:08] but there's a purpose for this coming
[1:17:13] it's not just to shout and dance and
[1:17:15] have a good time
[1:17:16] we're so excited about the old life
[1:17:18] being cleansed
[1:17:20] how many is excited about the old life
[1:17:21] being cleansed about there being a power
[1:17:24] here that will purge out
[1:17:25] and burn out all the sin nature all
[1:17:28] that's wrong
[1:17:28] and give a new life amen but there's a
[1:17:32] purpose for that
[1:17:34] because the bride could never attain to
[1:17:36] the position that she was called to be
[1:17:38] with guilt and condemnation and the
[1:17:40] former life plaguing our thoughts
[1:17:42] friends we're called something to
[1:17:44] something higher than that we can't be
[1:17:46] sitting here and now this is when we get
[1:17:48] right down to home
[1:17:49] because we can't be sitting here
[1:17:51] expecting to manifest the full life of
[1:17:53] jesus christ
[1:17:54] still feeling condemned in our flesh
[1:17:57] you go to pray for somebody and oh you
[1:17:59] know brother branham went to
[1:18:00] went to pray for a little child that was
[1:18:03] sick and brother branham had sinned
[1:18:06] right he had had his wife lied to the
[1:18:08] lawyer for him to cover for him he
[1:18:10] stepped out of the house
[1:18:11] and now he goes down to pray and he's
[1:18:13] prayed for thousands of people
[1:18:15] thousands of times and time after time
[1:18:17] after time god answers his prayer and
[1:18:19] they're healed
[1:18:20] but he goes this time and as he goes to
[1:18:22] move his hands to the child
[1:18:23] amen the lord speaks to him said how can
[1:18:26] you pray for that child after what
[1:18:28] you've done
[1:18:28] you lied see what condemnation will do
[1:18:33] condemnation will stop the manifestation
[1:18:35] of a son of god
[1:18:41] but if your heart continues we have one
[1:18:43] greater
[1:18:45] we have one greater we have an advocate
[1:18:47] who can clean the bloodstream
[1:18:52] we are called to token life
[1:18:56] we've been called to manifest the very
[1:18:59] life of jesus christ
[1:19:01] but of old things in the past and old
[1:19:03] ways and old habits and
[1:19:05] our old self every time we go to pray if
[1:19:08] it's plaguing us
[1:19:09] then we don't have prayer of faith every
[1:19:12] time we go to act and we step out
[1:19:14] all of a sudden we're condemned because
[1:19:16] of our past condemned because of what we
[1:19:18] used to be
[1:19:19] condemned because of what we've done
[1:19:21] friends there's got to be something
[1:19:22] coming this day
[1:19:23] that'll break that completely away from
[1:19:25] you and what is it
[1:19:27] it's a perfect blood from a perfect lamb
[1:19:29] amen the lamb's been held up for so long
[1:19:32] showing that he's perfect but but the
[1:19:34] blood has come the life of the blood
[1:19:36] has come in full measure this day to
[1:19:38] prove that you're
[1:19:39] perfect
[1:19:44] oh you still don't believe it
[1:19:47] amen you are the sinless
[1:19:50] spotless virtuous bride of jesus christ
[1:19:55] you never did it in the first place amen
[1:19:57] in your first condition
[1:19:59] you never sinned in your first condition
[1:20:01] you were perfect
[1:20:02] and your first condition you came from
[1:20:04] god there's absolutely nothing wrong
[1:20:06] with you
[1:20:07] but the virgin birth amen believing in
[1:20:09] this virgin word that's come back
[1:20:11] by faith in that being washed by the
[1:20:13] blood of the lamb puts you
[1:20:14] back in your original condition which is
[1:20:17] perfect attribute of god
[1:20:19] son or daughter of god fully redeemed
[1:20:25] he said wednesday you've got to stop
[1:20:28] looking at yourself
[1:20:29] because god's not looking at you
[1:20:33] when you come down to prayer and you
[1:20:35] kneel down before god
[1:20:36] and you start making requests and
[1:20:38] supplication god's not even looking at
[1:20:40] you
[1:20:42] he's looking at the lamb and if the lamb
[1:20:45] is perfect
[1:20:46] you're perfect because you've identified
[1:20:49] yourself with this lamb
[1:20:51] amen when the worshiper would come in
[1:20:53] the old times under substitution
[1:20:55] he'd bring a lamb amen and he could have
[1:20:57] he could have had dirty garments he
[1:20:59] could have been
[1:21:00] tattered he could have been bruised and
[1:21:01] beaten himself but the pie priest never
[1:21:04] looked at the man
[1:21:05] it didn't matter what kind of condition
[1:21:06] this man was in he put his eyes on the
[1:21:08] lamb
[1:21:09] because if the man brought a perfect
[1:21:11] lamb this man was going to be made
[1:21:13] perfect
[1:21:16] so the man couldn't just come and drop
[1:21:18] off his lamb and go off and say the lamb
[1:21:20] took care of it
[1:21:21] but this man at the time of the slaying
[1:21:23] of the lamb he would have to take his
[1:21:25] hands and put his hands on the lamb
[1:21:27] and be completely identified with the
[1:21:29] lamb and when he was completely
[1:21:31] identified with the lamb then they would
[1:21:33] slay the lamb
[1:21:34] and the innocent life of the lamb would
[1:21:36] cover his sins
[1:21:39] that's why we have to come and be
[1:21:41] completely identified
[1:21:43] with our lamb completely
[1:21:46] 100 percent identified with the word of
[1:21:48] god
[1:21:51] and then we're perfect
[1:21:56] we can't walk around with condemnation
[1:22:00] you know if we're guilty and it's not
[1:22:04] under the blood
[1:22:05] then let guilt drive you to desperation
[1:22:09] amen and receive the life amen of god
[1:22:12] but let it purge you so thoroughly clean
[1:22:14] that your blood issues change
[1:22:16] and you receive a blood transfusion and
[1:22:18] now you have the life of jesus christ on
[1:22:20] the scene
[1:22:21] and you're now perfect in the eyes of
[1:22:23] god
[1:22:24] here's what brother branham says i i
[1:22:27] want you to
[1:22:28] just listen to me we're in the same
[1:22:29] place the same quote when he talks about
[1:22:31] god doing a blood transfusion he says
[1:22:34] within just a few moments time
[1:22:36] a brand new bloodstream
[1:22:39] now listen to what the prophet says next
[1:22:42] i believe i'm not going to speak in his
[1:22:44] name i'm going to speak
[1:22:45] in my revelation of my faith this is
[1:22:48] what brother branham's saying
[1:22:50] my revelation of my faith
[1:22:53] what happened in sabino canyon the other
[1:22:55] day i believe that the hour is
[1:22:57] approaching
[1:22:58] when missing limbs will be restored and
[1:23:01] the glorious power of the creator i
[1:23:03] believe
[1:23:04] he can make a squirrel appear if a man
[1:23:07] or woman just got a part missing and
[1:23:08] that's complete animal itself
[1:23:10] oh god i love him
[1:23:14] do you believe amen
[1:23:17] brother rem said in the feast of
[1:23:18] trumpets he's talking about those two
[1:23:20] witnesses
[1:23:21] and they're bringing israel back to the
[1:23:22] feast of atonement where they're going
[1:23:24] to recognize that they rejected the lamb
[1:23:26] and they're going to come in contact
[1:23:27] with jesus christ
[1:23:28] the true lamb for the atonement he says
[1:23:31] the seventh angel's message under the
[1:23:32] same trumpet same everything
[1:23:34] the same seal is to what call the people
[1:23:37] the bride
[1:23:38] out of the pentecostal and world
[1:23:40] tradition
[1:23:41] to the genuine atonement
[1:23:44] the word what is the genuine atonement
[1:23:49] the word this is exactly why
[1:23:53] that you can see jesus christ nailed to
[1:23:55] a cross
[1:23:56] amen 2 000 years ago but reject
[1:23:59] jesus christ come in the fullness of his
[1:24:01] word today and you have not come to the
[1:24:03] fullness of atonement
[1:24:05] you have recognized where atonement was
[1:24:07] you have recognized the purchase of
[1:24:08] atonement but atonement is the word
[1:24:11] and the seventh angel's message is to
[1:24:13] bring us to the full measure of
[1:24:15] atonement
[1:24:16] which is the full word if you got the
[1:24:19] full word and received the full word
[1:24:22] you've received the true atonement
[1:24:25] and what is atonement it's a covering of
[1:24:28] your sin
[1:24:29] now you have no sin
[1:24:34] it says in christ the mystery of god
[1:24:36] revealed the church
[1:24:38] is the blood of christ oh friends
[1:24:44] church is the blood of christ by the
[1:24:46] spirit
[1:24:47] because the life is in the blood
[1:24:52] when you receive the life that was in
[1:24:54] the blood
[1:24:55] you've received amen that is the token
[1:24:58] of the blood
[1:24:59] that's the evidence of the blood that is
[1:25:01] the blood it's the spirit of god amen
[1:25:04] it's the spirit that was in that blood
[1:25:06] he goes on to say
[1:25:08] the prophet goes on to say when we
[1:25:10] really place our hands upon our
[1:25:12] sacrifice jesus and feel in our hearts
[1:25:14] that we're guilty and know that
[1:25:15] what we're doing the blood of that
[1:25:17] sacrifice the life that was in the blood
[1:25:19] was god
[1:25:20] himself so he comes back upon you
[1:25:24] the holy spirit on
[1:25:27] on another message he says now but when
[1:25:29] jesus the son of god
[1:25:30] virgin born shed his blood the life that
[1:25:33] was in that blood was god
[1:25:35] itself the bible said we are saved
[1:25:39] by the life the blood of god not the
[1:25:41] blood of new a jew not the blood of a
[1:25:43] gentile
[1:25:44] but the life of god
[1:25:47] now the token is not the blood
[1:25:50] it is the life that was in the blood the
[1:25:53] holy spirit
[1:25:55] see the world wants to claim that
[1:25:58] they're under the blood of jesus christ
[1:26:02] my question is where is it
[1:26:07] we're under the blood of jesus christ
[1:26:09] we're under the true atonement
[1:26:10] where is it brother ben said that blood
[1:26:12] was spilt
[1:26:14] and the in the in the ground of judea
[1:26:16] went back into the dust
[1:26:17] but what is it it's the life that was in
[1:26:20] that blood
[1:26:20] that's the fullness of atonement that's
[1:26:22] what's come back
[1:26:24] when the word came back the life came
[1:26:26] back
[1:26:28] now there's just a couple more things i
[1:26:30] want to say and then we'll go i want us
[1:26:32] to catch something brother branham links
[1:26:33] two things together in the fourth seal
[1:26:36] that's going to be really important for
[1:26:37] you and i this is tremendous faith
[1:26:39] building for me
[1:26:44] now he says at the feast of the trumpets
[1:26:47] he said the holy spirit has been bound
[1:26:49] by these denominational rivers for
[1:26:51] almost 2 000 years
[1:26:53] but is to be loosed in the evening time
[1:26:55] by the evening time message
[1:26:57] the holy spirit back in the church again
[1:27:00] christ himself revealed in human flesh
[1:27:03] in the evening time
[1:27:04] he said he promised it
[1:27:09] jesus said in john 6 53
[1:27:13] jesus said unto them verily verily i say
[1:27:15] unto you except ye eat the flesh of the
[1:27:17] son of man
[1:27:18] and drink his blood you have no life in
[1:27:20] you
[1:27:23] i don't know how you get around that how
[1:27:25] are we going to get around that
[1:27:27] jesus said unless you eat
[1:27:31] amen unless you accept ye eat the flesh
[1:27:34] of the son of man
[1:27:35] and drink his blood you have no life in
[1:27:38] you
[1:27:39] how are you going to eat his flesh and
[1:27:41] drink his blood
[1:27:45] what is his flesh he's the word made
[1:27:48] flesh
[1:27:49] unless you eat his flesh and drink his
[1:27:52] blood
[1:27:52] what's his blood the life is in the
[1:27:54] blood it's the holy ghost
[1:27:56] unless you eat his word receive his word
[1:28:00] and drink of his spirit you have no life
[1:28:02] in you
[1:28:07] john 6 there's no there's no wiggle room
[1:28:09] around here we can't get around the
[1:28:11] scripture
[1:28:12] unless you and this is why this is why
[1:28:14] the catholic church came up with
[1:28:15] transubstantiation because they knew
[1:28:17] they don't have the word and they don't
[1:28:19] have the life so they had to come up
[1:28:20] with a substitute
[1:28:21] and the substitute amen is a round wafer
[1:28:24] and wine and they're saying when we
[1:28:26] pray a certain prayer and ring a little
[1:28:27] bell all of a sudden this turns into the
[1:28:30] literal body
[1:28:31] of jesus christ and the literal blood of
[1:28:33] jesus christ
[1:28:34] and now when you eat that wafer and
[1:28:36] drink that blood you've received him and
[1:28:38] now you have life
[1:28:39] amen what a bunch of nonsense
[1:28:43] it's become our money-making racket
[1:28:45] worldwide amen
[1:28:47] they come to communion so that you can
[1:28:48] be part of christ oh my goodness he
[1:28:50] wasn't talking about a natural bread and
[1:28:52] a natural blood
[1:28:53] he said unless you does you eat my flesh
[1:28:56] and drink my blood you have no life in
[1:28:58] you
[1:28:58] but friends the blood was limited amen
[1:29:01] and the
[1:29:02] and the bread has been limited for 2 000
[1:29:04] years
[1:29:05] the holy ghost has been bound for 2 000
[1:29:07] years so now you have a weak anemic
[1:29:09] church
[1:29:10] that's only getting portions of bread
[1:29:11] not the full portion little pieces of
[1:29:13] bread and only little sips amen a dip in
[1:29:16] the holy ghost here a dip in the holy
[1:29:18] ghost there
[1:29:18] but they're not able to come to the full
[1:29:20] life because they only have a little bit
[1:29:22] of bread
[1:29:23] and a little bit of wine
[1:29:27] now you see why the seals had to be open
[1:29:29] and the word had to be restored
[1:29:31] because the full life has to come back
[1:29:33] now we've got to come back to genesis 3
[1:29:35] the seed of the woman has to come back
[1:29:37] to the church
[1:29:40] not just a piece here and a piece there
[1:29:43] and a little sip here
[1:29:45] but now the whole bread
[1:29:49] jesus says i am the bread of life it
[1:29:52] comes down from the father
[1:29:54] amen now the word has been restored
[1:29:58] under the fourth seal we see 1963 takes
[1:30:01] place the opening of the seals
[1:30:03] and now all the bread has come back
[1:30:07] amen all of the word has been restored
[1:30:10] and when all the words restored all of
[1:30:13] the holy spirit has been restored
[1:30:16] now how much of the life of jesus christ
[1:30:18] can you live
[1:30:22] how much of the life of jesus christ can
[1:30:25] you live
[1:30:27] if you have full word and full spirit
[1:30:31] which is full life then you can live the
[1:30:33] full
[1:30:34] life of jesus christ all that he did
[1:30:37] you can do amen all that happened in him
[1:30:40] all that happened in the bridegroom can
[1:30:42] happen in the bride
[1:30:43] because now we've received the full
[1:30:45] measure again not a portion
[1:30:47] not a bit not a dip but the full baptism
[1:30:50] of the holy ghost bringing the full life
[1:30:52] of jesus christ
[1:30:52] with the full measure of the word and
[1:30:54] bringing the word to pass
[1:30:58] now listen to what brother man says
[1:31:00] under the fourth seal how he ties these
[1:31:01] things together
[1:31:05] i believe that sin will be broke up and
[1:31:08] when it's confessed upon the bases of
[1:31:09] the blood of jesus christ
[1:31:11] it's like dropping a drop of black ink
[1:31:13] and a bunch of clorox bleach
[1:31:15] it just breaks it into the chemicals and
[1:31:16] sends it plumb back to where it came
[1:31:18] from
[1:31:20] where did it come from lucifer
[1:31:24] i said this before but i think some
[1:31:26] people missed it i want to lay this down
[1:31:28] here real good
[1:31:33] we've come back to now
[1:31:36] we're not under a portion of the spirit
[1:31:40] and a portion of the word living a
[1:31:41] portion of the life we understand that
[1:31:45] the revelation of jesus christ should do
[1:31:47] something to us it should change the way
[1:31:48] we live
[1:31:50] the message didn't come so that we could
[1:31:52] write textbooks and debate with
[1:31:53] theologians
[1:31:54] that's pointless that's an absolute
[1:31:56] waste of time but the revelation
[1:31:58] came that by revelation of the word it
[1:32:00] brings the life of the word
[1:32:02] which should be on display it should
[1:32:03] actually change the way we live
[1:32:05] amen and as god reveals more to us we
[1:32:08] should be living a more
[1:32:09] a more christ-like life not less so as
[1:32:12] we walk along and god reveals more
[1:32:14] we shouldn't be living a less of a life
[1:32:16] we should be living more of the life
[1:32:19] right and so now we've come now to
[1:32:23] where we're not taking a dip and we're
[1:32:24] not here for the covering of sins of
[1:32:26] ignorance
[1:32:27] but we've come to the full atonement the
[1:32:29] word
[1:32:30] and that full atonement will absolutely
[1:32:33] remove
[1:32:34] every bit of your sin and drive it back
[1:32:36] to where it came from
[1:32:37] and it came from lucifer himself
[1:32:41] and this is the point that i want to
[1:32:42] make when a sinner goes down with their
[1:32:45] sins attached to them they haven't come
[1:32:47] to atonement
[1:32:48] haven't come to the word when a sinner
[1:32:50] goes down with sins
[1:32:51] he comes up in the white throne judgment
[1:32:53] with his sins and he stands judgment for
[1:32:55] his own sins
[1:32:57] now we know that sin originated in
[1:32:59] heaven when lucifer rebelled against
[1:33:02] a god but but lucifer now has come down
[1:33:06] and caused deception in eden caused the
[1:33:08] woman to fall
[1:33:09] and now there had to be redemption and
[1:33:11] all these things happen
[1:33:12] but whenever we go down with our sin
[1:33:15] we come up with our sin lucifer stands
[1:33:18] over here and he's guiltless
[1:33:22] but when a son or daughter of god passes
[1:33:24] through the bleach of the blood of jesus
[1:33:26] christ
[1:33:27] that sin is broke off of them broke up
[1:33:29] and sent
[1:33:30] back to the originator the original
[1:33:32] perverter of the word
[1:33:33] and it goes back to lucifer so now when
[1:33:36] we stand there on the day of judgment
[1:33:38] we have come up totally completely
[1:33:40] sinless
[1:33:41] we're not to be judged for anything
[1:33:43] because there's no sin attached to us
[1:33:45] but everything that you ever did wrong
[1:33:47] and everything that you ever tricked
[1:33:48] into doing
[1:33:49] and everything that happened because of
[1:33:50] hybridization now you're sitting on the
[1:33:53] throne
[1:33:53] sitted beside christ jesus and don't you
[1:33:56] know that the saints shall judge the
[1:33:57] world
[1:33:58] he give judgment unto his saints and
[1:34:00] we're sitting here judging the world and
[1:34:02] here comes
[1:34:02] lucifer and attached to lucifer is
[1:34:05] everything that you ever did wrong
[1:34:08] not to you to him amen when a sinner
[1:34:10] goes down though he's duped by the same
[1:34:12] thing you're duped by
[1:34:13] though he's fallen at the same condition
[1:34:15] you're falling by he comes up
[1:34:17] bearing his own sins and the own
[1:34:19] consequences for his sins
[1:34:20] and he has to stand judgment that way
[1:34:22] and lucifer is scot-free
[1:34:26] why do you think he hates you so much
[1:34:29] why do you think he hates this word so
[1:34:30] much
[1:34:32] because the children of god are the only
[1:34:34] ones that can condemn him
[1:34:37] the children of god coming through the
[1:34:39] bleach of the blood of jesus christ
[1:34:41] through the price of redemption
[1:34:42] they are the only ones that can condemn
[1:34:45] him
[1:34:47] and when you pass through this the
[1:34:48] bleach it breaks it off of you
[1:34:50] and sends it back to the original
[1:34:52] perverter
[1:34:53] satan himself
[1:34:58] and he comes before you
[1:35:02] oh how the tide has turned
[1:35:05] oh how things have changed i'm now
[1:35:09] spotless and literally white
[1:35:10] i'm now the bride of jesus christ
[1:35:12] sitting on the throne and now he comes
[1:35:14] everything that he tried to pin to me
[1:35:17] everything that he tried to do to me
[1:35:19] he is now standing in front of me facing
[1:35:21] for his own crimes
[1:35:24] and i'm completely guiltless he said
[1:35:27] wednesday
[1:35:28] haman is going to hang on his own
[1:35:29] gallows and satan is going to fall by
[1:35:32] his own deception
[1:35:34] so in the fourth seal brother brahm said
[1:35:36] it goes through the clorox it bleeds
[1:35:38] the chemicals and sends it plumb back to
[1:35:40] where it came from
[1:35:42] and that's the way the blood of jesus
[1:35:43] christ does and sets a man across the
[1:35:45] chasm again as a son of god
[1:35:47] see and then he becomes the creative
[1:35:50] power of god is
[1:35:51] in him and at least whenever god can
[1:35:53] command it to be done
[1:35:54] it'll be done we and we get back
[1:35:57] amen see that when moses under the blood
[1:36:01] of bulls
[1:36:02] and when he met that light that pillar
[1:36:04] of fire in that burning bush and stood
[1:36:05] down there in a
[1:36:06] commission god had given him and he was
[1:36:09] a prophet
[1:36:10] and when the word of the lord came to
[1:36:11] him he spoke in even things
[1:36:13] created by the word and now if it'll do
[1:36:16] that
[1:36:16] under the blood of bulls what about the
[1:36:18] blood of jesus
[1:36:20] not covered but remitted altogether and
[1:36:22] you stand in the presence
[1:36:24] of god as a redeemed son now see the
[1:36:26] church is
[1:36:27] far beyond its standard of living
[1:36:30] brother branham takes this cloroc bleach
[1:36:32] and you coming free
[1:36:34] he takes that and puts you in condition
[1:36:39] to manifest the word of god
[1:36:43] it brings you across the chasm as a son
[1:36:45] of god
[1:36:47] and the creative power of god is in you
[1:36:51] and whenever god commands it to be done
[1:36:53] you can speak
[1:36:56] why what does that the clorox bleach of
[1:36:59] the blood of jesus christ
[1:37:00] brings you back across the chasm there
[1:37:03] was a chasm because of sin
[1:37:06] amen and jesus didn't just build a
[1:37:08] bridge across the chasm
[1:37:10] brother dwayne lawson was talking about
[1:37:12] this at camp he didn't just build a
[1:37:14] bridge across the chasm
[1:37:15] what he did is he removed the chasm and
[1:37:18] brought you back by the belief of the
[1:37:20] blood of jesus christ
[1:37:21] back to your original sinless condition
[1:37:23] and now you're standing with god on his
[1:37:25] side
[1:37:28] and now a fully redeemed son of god
[1:37:35] further in the force theo said that's
[1:37:36] what the blood of jesus christ does to
[1:37:38] the true child of god
[1:37:39] when he confesses that sin and stands
[1:37:41] there justified
[1:37:42] mercy goodness even is so great till god
[1:37:45] said i can't even remember it anymore
[1:37:48] and he's absolutely my son verily i say
[1:37:51] unto you if you say to this mountain
[1:37:52] he connects these two things listen to
[1:37:55] this
[1:37:56] he's connecting full redemption full
[1:37:58] atonement
[1:37:59] being purged of your sin he connects it
[1:38:01] with if you say unto this mountain be
[1:38:04] moved and don't doubt in your heart but
[1:38:05] believe in what you said
[1:38:06] it shall come to pass you can have what
[1:38:08] you have said
[1:38:10] you are a redeemed son amen i know
[1:38:12] that's true
[1:38:13] i've seen squirrels to appear yonder on
[1:38:15] six different times
[1:38:16] that not one that i would be and not the
[1:38:19] one that would be sitting here
[1:38:20] just as he can create squirrels the same
[1:38:23] as he can create flies or frogs or
[1:38:25] anything else
[1:38:25] he's god the creator that's right and
[1:38:27] with no mortal being
[1:38:29] but when the sin of that mortal is
[1:38:31] confessed and dropped into the clorox of
[1:38:33] the bleach of jesus christ
[1:38:34] that bleach is all sin he's purely
[1:38:37] unadulterated without sin without fall
[1:38:40] he that's born of god does not commit
[1:38:42] sin for he cannot sin the bleach stands
[1:38:44] between him and god
[1:38:46] how could it ever get there when it
[1:38:47] breaks it up and sends it right back to
[1:38:49] the one
[1:38:50] who perverted it it breaks it up and
[1:38:53] sends it right back to the one
[1:38:55] who perverted it and the fourth seal
[1:38:57] brother branham starts talking about
[1:38:59] this blood condition that's completely
[1:39:01] clear
[1:39:02] then he starts talking about the the
[1:39:04] restoration of the word bringing us
[1:39:06] back into this the seed of the woman
[1:39:09] back to full redemption
[1:39:10] back to a full life and he ties it
[1:39:13] together
[1:39:14] with speaking creation
[1:39:17] why because with revelation you
[1:39:20] understand
[1:39:22] that we're totally sinless there's no
[1:39:25] condemnation therefore to them that are
[1:39:27] in christ jesus
[1:39:29] we're free friends when god quickens it
[1:39:32] in your heart
[1:39:33] you can speak it when god drops it by
[1:39:36] faith into your heart you can ask for it
[1:39:38] if it's in the word you can have it
[1:39:40] if he quickens it to your heart you can
[1:39:42] have it why because you've come to the
[1:39:44] realization there is no
[1:39:45] sin in me but the problem is we see the
[1:39:49] word
[1:39:49] we understand the word we believe the
[1:39:51] word but our heart conditions
[1:39:54] god begins to stir in our heart build
[1:39:56] faith but all of a sudden but i
[1:39:58] dis and i that and i this we need a good
[1:40:01] dose of the bleach of the blood of jesus
[1:40:03] christ
[1:40:03] and a revelation that we are now the
[1:40:05] sinless spotless virtuous bride of jesus
[1:40:08] christ and what we see in the word we
[1:40:10] come before god in a sinless condition
[1:40:12] to ask for what we need
[1:40:15] and when god begins to quicken into your
[1:40:17] heart just speak it friends
[1:40:18] amen speak it but these polluted lips
[1:40:20] they're not polluted lips they're
[1:40:22] purified lips
[1:40:25] this old me and this all that there's
[1:40:27] not a thing wrong with you friends
[1:40:30] in the eyes of god you're perfect
[1:40:34] amen ask what you will
[1:40:37] and it shall be done for you
[1:40:44] i want to finish with this quote
[1:40:45] musicians if you can come
[1:40:47] brother tommy
[1:40:52] in the church age book the revelation of
[1:40:54] jesus christ
[1:40:57] so how we need a revelation by the
[1:40:59] spirit
[1:41:01] we don't need a new bible we don't need
[1:41:03] a new translation
[1:41:04] though some are very good and i'm not
[1:41:06] against them but we need the revelation
[1:41:09] of the spirit i thank god we can have
[1:41:12] what we need for god wants to reveal his
[1:41:15] word to us
[1:41:16] by his spirit may god begin by his
[1:41:19] spirit
[1:41:19] to give us continuous life-giving
[1:41:23] and prevailing revelation
[1:41:27] think about this revelation
[1:41:31] is not making you smarter so you can go
[1:41:33] show somebody how much you know
[1:41:37] revelation is life-giving
[1:41:41] well i you know i don't understand and
[1:41:43] these things are so hard
[1:41:45] and i don't think you have to know that
[1:41:47] i think god just looks at what's in your
[1:41:49] heart
[1:41:51] sorry friends revelation is life-giving
[1:41:55] revelation is not intellectual
[1:41:56] conception revelation is not textbook
[1:41:59] understanding
[1:42:00] revelation is when god quickens into
[1:42:01] your heart and you say that's nothing
[1:42:03] but the truth
[1:42:04] explain it i can't but it's nothing but
[1:42:06] the truth i know it's the truth
[1:42:08] what did you just hear i can't tell it
[1:42:10] to you but something inside of me said
[1:42:12] that's the truth
[1:42:13] that's revelation friends you listen to
[1:42:16] the tape and something inside of you
[1:42:17] stirs
[1:42:18] and a minute later somebody asked you to
[1:42:20] explain the seven seals
[1:42:21] i can't explain it to you but i believe
[1:42:23] it that's by revelation
[1:42:25] friends and revelation is
[1:42:28] life-giving he said may god begin by his
[1:42:32] spirit to give us continuous
[1:42:35] life-giving and prevailing revelation
[1:42:39] oh if the church could only get a fresh
[1:42:41] revelation
[1:42:42] and become by it
[1:42:47] by what by a fresh revelation
[1:42:51] all right he said the church is going to
[1:42:53] become something
[1:42:54] they're going to become by by a fresh
[1:42:57] revelation they're going to become
[1:42:58] something
[1:42:59] does anybody know what we're going to
[1:43:00] become it's going to take a fresh
[1:43:03] revelation
[1:43:06] if the church could only get a fresh
[1:43:08] revelation and become by
[1:43:10] it the living word manifested
[1:43:15] we would do the greater works and
[1:43:17] glorify god our father
[1:43:19] in heaven what is this word to do
[1:43:22] give you continuous life-giving
[1:43:25] prevailing revelation and by it
[1:43:28] the prevailing revelation by a fresh
[1:43:31] revelation
[1:43:32] amen you become the word manifested
[1:43:36] see it's never been based off willpower
[1:43:40] it's never been based off your ability
[1:43:41] to do right or wrong
[1:43:43] the revelation amen of where we are and
[1:43:46] what we're doing
[1:43:47] brings the life of god and the life of
[1:43:49] god amen
[1:43:51] is on display and is the word made
[1:43:53] manifest
[1:43:55] it's not good enough to say well the
[1:43:56] prophet did all that that's wonderful
[1:43:58] the prophet did all that
[1:44:00] the bride's supposed to live that life
[1:44:04] the whole bride not each of us have to
[1:44:06] become a prophet we don't all have to
[1:44:07] raise the dead we don't all
[1:44:08] have to do those wonderful things amen
[1:44:11] but but but
[1:44:12] that life should be in the bride that
[1:44:15] life should be in the bride and how we
[1:44:17] gonna do it because we're perfect
[1:44:20] we are sinless as god is why true
[1:44:23] atonement has come
[1:44:25] and we've stepped into the true
[1:44:27] atonement and now
[1:44:29] the old hybridization the blood
[1:44:30] condition the cancer in your blood
[1:44:33] you've got a new bloodstream in a
[1:44:36] moment's time
[1:44:37] he gave you a new bloodstream and now
[1:44:40] that's the life
[1:44:41] that we live i said i was going to tell
[1:44:44] you the last quote but that was the last
[1:44:45] quote while you're sitting let's stand
[1:44:50] and we'll try to make this the last
[1:44:51] quote while you're standing
[1:44:57] second corinthians 5 21 says for he hath
[1:44:59] made him to be sin for us who knew no
[1:45:01] sin
[1:45:02] that we might be made the righteousness
[1:45:04] of god
[1:45:05] in him in the church age book in the
[1:45:09] revelation jesus christ he says he
[1:45:10] refers to the same scripture
[1:45:13] for second corinthians 5 21 that we have
[1:45:15] become the righteousness of god by our
[1:45:16] union with jesus christ
[1:45:18] did you get it it says that we are the
[1:45:20] very righteousness of god himself
[1:45:23] by being in christ it says that he jesus
[1:45:26] became sin for us
[1:45:28] it does not say he became sinful but
[1:45:29] became sin for us
[1:45:31] that by our union with him we might
[1:45:33] become
[1:45:34] the righteousness of god if we accept
[1:45:37] the fact and we must that he literally
[1:45:40] became
[1:45:40] sin for us by his substitution for us
[1:45:43] then we must
[1:45:44] also accept the fact that we by our
[1:45:46] union with him have become the very
[1:45:49] righteousness of god
[1:45:52] don't call yourself anything less
[1:45:55] don't confess anything less that by your
[1:45:58] union with jesus christ
[1:46:00] he became sin for you that in him
[1:46:03] you might become when you're in him
[1:46:05] baptized in him by the baptism of the
[1:46:07] holy ghost
[1:46:08] you might become the righteousness of
[1:46:11] god
[1:46:15] so then why can't you ask for what's in
[1:46:16] the word yes
[1:46:18] why can't you pray for the sick and
[1:46:20] expect him to be well why can't you
[1:46:21] amen why can't a family gather together
[1:46:24] under the high priest of daddy when
[1:46:25] somebody's sick in the family
[1:46:26] why can't they pray and expect that god
[1:46:29] will answer the prayer
[1:46:30] why because they've become the
[1:46:31] righteousness of god by being birthed in
[1:46:33] jesus christ
[1:46:37] he says we must accept the fact that by
[1:46:39] our union with him
[1:46:41] have become the very righteousness of
[1:46:43] god to reject one
[1:46:45] is to reject the other
[1:46:48] so if you reject the fact that you've
[1:46:50] become the righteousness of god
[1:46:52] you reject the fact that he became sin
[1:46:54] for you
[1:46:56] and you're not even saved
[1:47:01] that one's a good one tell the devil
[1:47:04] just stick that right in his eye next
[1:47:05] time he comes down
[1:47:07] then on the pike and wants to accuse you
[1:47:08] amen everything
[1:47:10] under the blood fully redeemed amen to
[1:47:12] reject the fact that you're the
[1:47:14] righteousness of god
[1:47:15] would also be to reject the fact that he
[1:47:17] became sin for you
[1:47:19] and then you're not saved
[1:47:22] but if you're saved and your life is
[1:47:24] tucked away in jesus christ
[1:47:26] and you've come to the full atonement in
[1:47:27] our day the word then you are as
[1:47:29] righteous as god is righteous
[1:47:32] because on you have become the very
[1:47:34] righteousness of god
[1:47:36] because to say that i've come to the
[1:47:38] true word i've come to the atonement for
[1:47:39] this day
[1:47:40] i've come to the baptism of the holy
[1:47:41] ghost but i'm still a rotten sinner
[1:47:43] then you make god's blood worthless
[1:47:46] [Applause]
[1:47:49] you by your own confession has denied
[1:47:52] the righteousness of god
[1:47:53] because that was god's blood that was
[1:47:55] shed for you that's god's word that has
[1:47:57] come down in the fullness of atonement
[1:47:59] and if his word can't wash you with the
[1:48:01] water of the word and make you spotless
[1:48:03] white and wrinkle free
[1:48:04] then god's not god and your connective
[1:48:07] confession of your condition is making
[1:48:09] god less than what he is
[1:48:13] i don't want to be standing in line on
[1:48:15] that in the day of judgment taking the
[1:48:18] very holiness of god and making it dirty
[1:48:21] the very righteous word of god and
[1:48:23] saying it's not good enough
[1:48:25] because if you've come to the word for
[1:48:27] your day if you've come to the full
[1:48:29] measure
[1:48:29] of the opening of the word and you've
[1:48:31] received it with all your heart and
[1:48:32] received the baptism of holy ghost
[1:48:34] then you are pure snow white sinless
[1:48:37] virtuous bride of jesus christ and when
[1:48:40] you go around saying i'm no good i'll
[1:48:42] never amount to nothing i'll never get
[1:48:43] over this
[1:48:44] you have taken the righteousness of god
[1:48:46] and polluted it with your own words
[1:48:50] never let a negative confession come out
[1:48:52] of your mouth concerning the word
[1:48:55] you are the very righteousness of jesus
[1:48:58] christ by being born again
[1:48:59] and being in christ
[1:49:05] his word is holy he is holy
[1:49:09] i may not feel like i'm worth two cents
[1:49:12] it don't matter the word says i'm
[1:49:14] perfect
[1:49:17] i may be having a crummy lousy day i may
[1:49:20] have had somebody at work make fun of me
[1:49:22] i may have somebody call out my errors
[1:49:24] and call out my mistakes
[1:49:26] and show how horrible i am and
[1:49:27] everything i try to do amen that doesn't
[1:49:30] make any difference
[1:49:31] because i don't read that in the word
[1:49:32] what i read in the word that he became
[1:49:35] sin for me then in him i might become
[1:49:37] the very righteousness of god
[1:49:39] and with a revelation of being in that
[1:49:41] condition what's going to stop you from
[1:49:43] overcoming in this life
[1:49:45] see the devil is lying to you he's
[1:49:47] always been lying to you
[1:49:49] he always will lie to you but if he says
[1:49:51] anything other than what this scripture
[1:49:53] says if you're born again in jesus
[1:49:55] christ if he tells you anything than
[1:49:57] this
[1:49:58] he's lying to you
[1:50:00] [Applause]
[1:50:02] hallelujah it's time to shut him up
[1:50:06] and the only way to shut him up is with
[1:50:08] the word
[1:50:11] to reject one is to reject the other to
[1:50:14] accept the one
[1:50:15] is to accept the other if he became sin
[1:50:18] for you
[1:50:19] then your men made the righteousness of
[1:50:21] of god now we know the bible says that
[1:50:26] it can't be denied but the revelation of
[1:50:29] it is missing
[1:50:30] it's not real to the majority of god's
[1:50:32] children it's just a good verse in the
[1:50:34] bible
[1:50:35] but we need to have it made alive to us
[1:50:38] that we take that will take
[1:50:41] revelation friends i don't know about
[1:50:45] you but i'm tired of saying something
[1:50:46] different than what the word says
[1:50:49] i'm tired of the devil telling me
[1:50:50] something different than what the word
[1:50:52] says
[1:50:53] but i'm going to say what the word says
[1:50:56] because it builds faith and we've got to
[1:50:58] operate a life of faith not unbelief but
[1:51:01] faith
[1:51:02] amen if you believe how many believe he
[1:51:05] became sin for you
[1:51:06] you personally that that he was made sin
[1:51:09] for you
[1:51:10] not sinful he didn't do a thing wrong
[1:51:12] but all your sin was put on him he was
[1:51:14] made sin for you
[1:51:15] if you believe that then you are by
[1:51:18] being in him you are the very
[1:51:20] righteousness of god
[1:51:22] you are the evidence of his
[1:51:23] righteousness you're the evidence of his
[1:51:25] holiness
[1:51:26] you're the evidence of his perfection
[1:51:28] amen
[1:51:29] well you know brother branham talks all
[1:51:31] through the seals about revelation 19
[1:51:33] jesus christ returning on a white horse
[1:51:35] amen and he says behind him
[1:51:37] follow the resurrected saints on white
[1:51:39] horses
[1:51:40] and white robes what are the white robes
[1:51:42] the righteousness
[1:51:43] of the saints what are the righteousness
[1:51:46] of the saints it's the righteousness
[1:51:48] of god he kept his word
[1:51:51] he provided a sacrifice he restored the
[1:51:53] word and he put it on you
[1:51:55] making him righteous your white robe is
[1:51:58] evidence to his righteousness
[1:52:03] your perfect condition your total
[1:52:05] atonement
[1:52:06] your 100 unification with god amen it is
[1:52:10] evidence of his righteousness his power
[1:52:13] of his word
[1:52:14] and his holiness not yours
[1:52:19] it's something he did you didn't do it
[1:52:22] he did it he decided before the
[1:52:25] foundational world he provided the lamb
[1:52:27] he brought the prophet on the scene he
[1:52:29] he restored the word
[1:52:30] he brought it down your path he gave you
[1:52:32] by grace the faith to receive it
[1:52:35] it's not what you did he did it has
[1:52:37] nothing to do with you so when it comes
[1:52:39] time to operate in the word of god
[1:52:40] quit talking about what you're doing
[1:52:42] because it has nothing to do with you
[1:52:47] it comes time now to take and apply the
[1:52:50] word and live the word
[1:52:51] and perform the word and all of a sudden
[1:52:53] we quit talking about what god's done we
[1:52:54] start talking about what we are
[1:52:56] amen it was never based on what you are
[1:52:59] and what you've done
[1:53:00] and what you look like and how you feel
[1:53:02] it's never been based on that
[1:53:05] so quit bringing that into the equation
[1:53:07] look at the lamb
[1:53:08] he's looking at the lamb look at the
[1:53:10] restored word look at the true atonement
[1:53:12] look at the power of god and believe
[1:53:16] and then just start walking in the life
[1:53:19] of jesus christ
[1:53:21] hallelujah don't make the holy word of
[1:53:25] god polluted and corrupt by your
[1:53:27] negative confession
[1:53:29] if he's if he made you perfect
[1:53:33] by his washing of the water of his word
[1:53:35] if he brought the true atonement in our
[1:53:37] day
[1:53:38] to make you perfect if he brought you
[1:53:40] through the bleach of the blood of jesus
[1:53:42] christ and removed all your sin
[1:53:44] and sent it back to the original don't
[1:53:46] you ever say
[1:53:47] anything different what if i make a
[1:53:50] mistake if you make a mistake
[1:53:52] you come back to the fountain
[1:53:56] you repent and you stay in your sinless
[1:53:59] condition
[1:54:01] if i make a mistake don't i have to do
[1:54:03] pencils and all of a sudden not pray for
[1:54:05] healing for
[1:54:06] a couple years and what you know don't i
[1:54:09] have to
[1:54:09] don't i have to sit on the sidelines for
[1:54:11] a while and not get back in the game
[1:54:15] who told you that has anybody ever heard
[1:54:19] that before
[1:54:20] has that ever whispered in your mind oh
[1:54:22] i can't even go to church i've been so
[1:54:24] condemned i've had such a horrible day
[1:54:26] i've done so much wrong
[1:54:27] i can't pray for this i can't pray for
[1:54:28] that hey listen brother branham went
[1:54:30] down to pray for that little baby
[1:54:32] and and also he said how can you pray
[1:54:34] you lied so he went and he
[1:54:36] talked to the lawyer and made it right
[1:54:37] then he went and prayed and he came
[1:54:39] right back he didn't sit on the
[1:54:40] sidelines he didn't take a timeout
[1:54:43] he didn't put himself in the penalty box
[1:54:45] once he took care of repentance he came
[1:54:47] right back
[1:54:47] he laid his hands on that baby and that
[1:54:49] baby was healed
[1:54:50] [Applause]
[1:54:52] you don't have to go to some devil's
[1:54:54] penalty box amen
[1:54:55] he's the one who's at fault not you and
[1:54:58] when you come under the atonement the
[1:55:00] blood of jesus christ
[1:55:01] you take it off of you and put it right
[1:55:03] back on him he can go sit in his own
[1:55:05] penalty box
[1:55:06] but i'm not taking time out from living
[1:55:08] the life of jesus christ
[1:55:09] just because i'm in a human condition
[1:55:11] and fall down once in a while
[1:55:13] i'm not stopping
[1:55:16] i'll get right back up dust my pants off
[1:55:18] repent if i got to make things right
[1:55:20] i'll make it right
[1:55:21] and i would that moment pray for the
[1:55:22] sickest person that would come here and
[1:55:24] ask for it
[1:55:27] why because of his righteousness not
[1:55:29] mine
[1:55:30] because of his word not my word because
[1:55:33] of his actions
[1:55:34] not my actions
[1:55:40] fourth seal the word came back to the
[1:55:44] church what came back with the church
[1:55:48] everything when the word came back
[1:55:52] it was the restitution of all things
[1:55:57] elias came first to restore
[1:56:01] all things jesus christ was received in
[1:56:04] the heavens until the restoration
[1:56:06] of all things but when it's time for the
[1:56:09] restoration of all things we see
[1:56:10] revelations 10 the mighty angel descend
[1:56:13] with an open book in his hand coming
[1:56:15] down
[1:56:16] for the restitution of all things
[1:56:21] and now you yourself
[1:56:24] are fully restored back to god
[1:56:28] he brought you across the chasm now
[1:56:30] you're standing on god's side
[1:56:32] a fully redeemed son or daughter of god
[1:56:36] don't let anybody ever tell you anything
[1:56:38] different
[1:56:40] anything different from that revelation
[1:56:42] is a lie
[1:56:45] how are you going to be lost you can't
[1:56:46] be lost
[1:56:49] how are you going to fall away you can't
[1:56:51] fall away you've already been brought
[1:56:53] across the castle
[1:56:56] oh god is good friends
[1:57:00] i love him i love him
[1:57:04] because he first loved me i believe him
[1:57:09] because by his grace he's given me faith
[1:57:11] to believe him
[1:57:12] he's done it all all i'm doing is
[1:57:14] responding to what he's done
[1:57:17] he's the husband sending love letters
[1:57:21] i'm just the humble little servant girl
[1:57:26] who now has this king paying attention
[1:57:29] to her
[1:57:31] don't know how to act exactly never had
[1:57:34] anything like this before
[1:57:36] lived a horrible life lived a dirty life
[1:57:39] just a little peasant little servant
[1:57:40] girl
[1:57:41] and all sudden the king himself writes
[1:57:43] me a little note and sends it over and
[1:57:44] says
[1:57:45] i've been thinking about you
[1:57:48] that's what these messages are they're
[1:57:50] love letters from the king to
[1:57:52] you he writes another one and says
[1:57:56] your condition's not your fault
[1:58:01] that's right another little letter says
[1:58:03] i've known all about you before you were
[1:58:04] born
[1:58:06] and where you're at now is not your
[1:58:08] fault it's a fault of an enemy
[1:58:11] if you'll be mine i'll take care of all
[1:58:13] of that for you
[1:58:16] and we're just a little servant girl the
[1:58:17] peasant girl's been beat up and knocked
[1:58:19] around all her life and
[1:58:20] lived a wicked life and done horrible
[1:58:22] things she thinks
[1:58:23] how can these things be how can i
[1:58:25] believe these things
[1:58:27] but something on the inside starts to
[1:58:29] turn and say i believe what he's writing
[1:58:31] i believe what he's saying it doesn't
[1:58:33] make any sense
[1:58:34] why me how could it be me i i'm the
[1:58:37] lowest of the lowest the worst of the
[1:58:39] worst
[1:58:39] how can it be me but there's something
[1:58:41] in me that believes it's for me
[1:58:44] the king writes another little letter he
[1:58:46] writes a little letter
[1:58:47] i've got a place prepared for you
[1:58:51] something inside though in a ragged
[1:58:53] condition
[1:58:54] something inside says that ain't nothing
[1:58:57] but the truth
[1:59:00] see that little girl is going to be
[1:59:02] redeemed
[1:59:03] and it's not going to be because of
[1:59:05] anything she's done
[1:59:07] but it's going to be what she yielded
[1:59:08] herself to
[1:59:10] all she has to do is respond to the love
[1:59:13] letter

[2:09:32] glory be to god so
[2:09:36] lift your wings
[2:09:48] you weren't born for
[2:09:51] this valley you were born
[2:09:56] for the sky
[2:10:00] [Music]
[2:10:12] foreign
[2:10:15] [Music]
[2:10:38] you were born for the sky
[2:10:42] don't let your trout
[2:10:46] ever get you down drive your spirits so
[2:10:50] close to the ground
[2:10:53] mount up with
[2:10:56] [Music]
[2:11:07] in this last day
[2:11:10] are setting their wings to fly
[2:11:16] above the storm
[2:11:19] and the rain and the deadness
[2:11:22] of this dark world
[2:11:27] impersonators will try to come down
[2:11:37] this flight is
[2:11:40] ordained by god and
[2:11:43] only the eagles can't stand
[2:11:46] so spread your wings
[2:11:50] little
[2:11:57] [Music]
[2:12:03] you were
[2:12:11] [Music]
[2:12:26] [Music]
[2:12:29] now the clouds are
[2:12:33] faster lightly
[2:12:37] flashing so bright
[2:12:40] while the darkness till they hide
[2:12:45] the sun
[2:12:47] [Music]
[2:13:00] before up above the storm you
[2:13:05] heard me say god is given
[2:13:08] the ego awakes so spread your knees
[2:13:22] [Music]
[2:13:27] you were gone
[2:13:31] [Music]
[2:13:39] [Music]
[2:13:43] with wings
