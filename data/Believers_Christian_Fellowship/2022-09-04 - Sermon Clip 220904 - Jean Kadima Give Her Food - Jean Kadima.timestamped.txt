[0:00] give her who
[0:03] the demsel
[0:04] who is the demsa the bride
[0:08] why is this show
[0:10] she is she is she's so young because
[0:12] it's a virgin see
[0:15] of the church
[0:17] and if you don't give it to her she's
[0:20] going to go back return to where she
[0:23] came from
[0:24] but don't give her your own ideas
[0:29] amen
[0:31] don't give her the philosophy of this
[0:34] world
[0:35] the psychology of this world is nothing
[0:39] wrong with it but not on the pulpit
[0:42] it's nothing to go in the cabinet
[0:45] somewhere with the doctor but
[0:48] she the bride should not be given
[0:51] psychology he won't help her
[0:54] don't give her another time food give
[0:58] her the food of today
[1:02] any other food will not help her
[1:06] anything else will not help our young
[1:09] people
[1:10] it will not
[1:11] help our old people
[1:14] entertainment is good but he won't help
[1:17] them
[1:18] what they need is to
[1:21] to go to come up higher
[1:25] there god has put all the ingredients
[1:28] that the church need
[1:31] what you need you individual
[1:33] all the ingredients
[1:35] all the things that you need
[1:37] is in that
[1:39] food
[1:40] therefore you cannot provide them with
[1:43] any other food but that food
[1:46] but let me tell you she has to eat too
[1:50] it's not just provide for her
[1:52] jesus said give her food
[1:56] but it implies that she is she has to
[1:58] eat
[2:00] maybe she has to chew on it
[2:03] amen she has to meditate on it
[2:06] otherwise he's gonna die
[2:08] but the
[2:09] lord said give her food but it means she
[2:13] has to consume that food
[2:17] chew on it
[2:18] meditate on it
[2:20] amen apply it
