[16:03] of John I just want to welcome all our
[16:06] visitors I know we've got several
[16:07] visitors and we're glad to have you I
[16:10] know the simonsons were coming so it was
[16:12] good to have Jordan and Rebecca again

[16:15] from different areas we want to say God

[16:19] here with us also want to say it's
[16:21] really good to have sister Joyce God

[16:35] also want to remind you that today will

[16:46] happy birthday brother Mike God bless
[16:48] you amen May the Lord's blessings be on
[16:50] you amen happy
[16:52] birthday praise the Lord God is
[16:55] good let's read here in uh third John
[16:59] chapter
[17:01] 1 thirr John chapter
[17:04] 1 and I'd like to read verse three and
[17:08] four for I rejoiced greatly when the
[17:10] Brethren came and testified of the truth
[17:12] that is in thee even as thou walkest in
[17:15] the truth I have no Greater Joy than to
[17:17] hear that my children Walk In Truth amen
[17:20] God bless you as you take your
[17:24] seats uh also wanted to make an
[17:26] announcement on behalf of the trustees
[17:29] the the trustees have decided that
[17:31] because of the eclipse coming tomorrow
[17:33] that they're going to rope off the the
[17:35] front of the property down through the
[17:37] front of the property and across the
[17:38] driveway because uh if you notice we got
[17:41] this giant parking lot in the back of
[17:43] the church that is open to I75 and we
[17:46] just don't want anybody driving by
[17:47] thinking that looks like a good place
[17:48] and and then uh and and so we don't know
[17:51] you just have no idea and rather than
[17:53] dealing with the liability that comes
[17:55] with that they've decided just the Rope
[17:56] it off so all that being the case we're
[17:59] all asking that nobody else come up here
[18:01] to to view the eclipse tomorrow because
[18:03] one car attracts two cars attracts three
[18:05] and then it becomes an attraction so
[18:08] we're going to try to keep the parking
[18:09] lot empty and keep that roped off so
[18:11] they'll they'll finish roping that off
[18:13] after the second service and uh and that
[18:17] way we don't have any issues not that we
[18:19] know that we would but it's a good way
[18:21] to eliminate the possibility we have no
[18:24] idea how many people are coming to the
[18:26] area there's been all kinds of numbers
[18:27] thrown out upwards of 100,000 and and I
[18:30] was thinking don't they know that it
[18:32] gets cloudy in April
[18:34] and I mean we hardly ever have the
[18:37] sunshine in the spring but amen God is
[18:41] good hopefully that we have a an
[18:43] opportunity to view it they say it's a
[18:45] once-in-a-lifetime event and it's quite
[18:47] remarkable to see so we thank God that
[18:50] hey we don't have to go anywhere it's
[18:51] easy for us so it comes right our way so
[18:55] that's good and I I was going to speak
[18:57] on the eclipse for just a minute because
[18:58] I get asked a lot of questions anytime
[19:00] there's a an event like this there's
[19:02] always questions and always speculation
[19:04] and and and I had different ones
[19:06] mentioned things to me and I hadn't
[19:08] really paid close attention to it so I
[19:10] got on the internet and looked and I was
[19:12] blown away there's video clips and
[19:15] pictures and the Earth is exploding and
[19:17] mushroom clouds and all this other stuff
[19:19] and I thought oh my goodness there's
[19:21] clickbait all over the place trying to
[19:23] get people just to click click click
[19:24] click click amen but I thank God God's
[19:27] given us a word amen and we can stay
[19:29] focused on the word of God and stay
[19:31] focused on the message and uh and I want
[19:34] to uh just speak about astronomical
[19:37] events for just a minute because we know
[19:39] that brother brandham said he declares
[19:40] in the heaven first before he does it on
[19:42] Earth and me so we know that that's
[19:44] absolutely true the problem is there's
[19:46] no Prophet here to tell us this equals
[19:49] that that's where that's where we get
[19:51] into trouble and that's where
[19:52] speculation becomes I think really
[19:54] really dangerous but but just in
[19:57] reference to this so we see the truth of
[19:58] it I went back to 1962 to the beginning
[20:01] of
[20:02] 1962 and brother brandham he lays out a
[20:05] pattern and it's so marvelous he comes
[20:08] in January uh of 1962 and we know 1962
[20:12] is a pivotal year for the prophet
[20:13] because he's going to preach in the
[20:14] spring spoken word is the Original Seed
[20:17] then he's going to come into a present
[20:18] stage of my Ministry at the end of 62
[20:21] he's going to have the series of six
[20:22] visions that are given to him plus he's
[20:24] going to have the tearing out of his
[20:26] gate knowing to go west and all of
[20:28] that's going to bring bring him into 63
[20:30] where there's the visitation of the
[20:31] Angels first The Sword in the hand and
[20:33] so it's a pivotal time and and there's
[20:36] also something happening in the heavens
[20:38] and he says this here he says as it was
[20:40] in the days of Sodom so shall it be in
[20:41] the coming of the son of man it's
[20:43] evening time where is God if God is with
[20:46] us where is the Miracles Hebrews 138
[20:49] said Jesus Christ is same yesterday
[20:50] today and forever then he goes into the
[20:53] prayer he said let us bow our heads
[20:54] Heavenly Father such a wonderful group
[20:56] of people to speak to and may I never
[20:58] get this privilege again I may never be
[21:00] here again oh God we may never see
[21:02] morning come science is trying to tell
[21:05] us that these five stars going to fall
[21:08] together that's why they say all the
[21:09] world and Nations they're froze up on
[21:11] this side of the Earth the continent
[21:13] here's Phoenix with pouring rains and
[21:14] weathers that they're never seen they
[21:17] claim that five stars are moving
[21:18] together out yonder some says the world
[21:21] will burst like a watermelon we don't
[21:23] believe that Lord there's there's to be
[21:24] a millennium yet but some says there'll
[21:27] be earthquakes that'll Shake That houses
[21:28] all over some of them says the great
[21:30] tidal waves will go 300 ft in the air in
[21:32] the next few days the worlds are
[21:34] trembling there's there'll be fearful
[21:37] signs you said in the last days sights
[21:39] signs in the heaven and in the earth
[21:41] fire Vapor pillars of smoke earthquakes
[21:43] in diverse places perplexity of time
[21:46] distress between nations man's heart
[21:47] failing for fear but that time Lord you
[21:50] said lift up your head your Redemption
[21:52] draw us
[21:53] nine so brother B's looking at this uh
[21:57] there's a a lot of news let's say in his
[21:59] day about these alignment he says five
[22:01] stars here but later he says it's
[22:03] alignment of five planets and he refers
[22:06] to a couple scriptures and let's look at
[22:08] those together Luke 21 if we could turn
[22:10] to
[22:20] that Luke
[22:25] 21 and I'm going to read verse 10 and 11
[22:29] Luke 21:10 then said he unto them Nation
[22:32] shall rise against nation and Kingdom
[22:34] against Kingdom and great earthquakes
[22:36] shall be in diverse places and famines
[22:38] and pestilences and fearful sights and
[22:41] Great Signs shall there be from Heaven
[22:43] let's go down to verse
[22:45] 25 and there shall be signs in the Sun
[22:48] and the Moon and in the stars and upon
[22:50] the Earth distress of nations with
[22:52] perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring
[22:54] men's heart failing them for fear and
[22:56] for the looking after those things which
[22:58] are coming on the earth for the powers
[23:00] of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall
[23:03] they see the son of man coming in a
[23:04] cloud with great power and great glory
[23:06] and when these things begin to come to
[23:08] pass then look up and lift up your heads
[23:10] for your Redemption draweth nigh amen
[23:13] for us there's not perplexity and fear
[23:15] amen there's a great anticipation
[23:17] because we know amen we know the day
[23:19] that we're living in we know because the
[23:22] word has been
[23:23] fulfilled now brother that was January
[23:26] we just read January 24th of 62 now we
[23:29] come to February 4th in the message
[23:31] communion he says we see that the
[23:33] astronomers are predicting something in
[23:35] this early part of the first part of the
[23:37] month beginning on the 2nd or the 5ifth
[23:39] or somewhere along this month the Indian
[23:41] astronomers predict the world to blow to
[23:43] pieces and the American newspapers make
[23:45] fun of it I do not believe the world's
[23:47] going to blow to Pieces but I do say
[23:49] it's wrong to make fun of it because
[23:52] something's fixing to happen one of
[23:53] these days something similar to that
[23:56] when these five
[23:57] planets when these five plants Mars
[24:00] Jupiter Venus and so forth come into
[24:01] their they never had did it oh they
[24:04] claimed maybe 25,000 years ago but who
[24:06] was back there now to know it I pr
[24:09] predict that this has a spiritual
[24:11] application I believe it's the coming in
[24:13] of the issue of God that the great
[24:15] Revelations of the world will be open
[24:16] during the word will be open during this
[24:19] time remember they claim it was three
[24:21] stars that came into their orbits when
[24:22] Jesus was born and this is five and five
[24:25] is Grace the number of Grace Three is
[24:27] the number Perfection five is the number
[24:29] of Grace so brother RS looking at this
[24:32] coming in January and February of this
[24:35] year of the year and and we know that
[24:37] the Stars according to Genesis 1 account
[24:39] the stars were given for signs and for
[24:42] seasons and days and for years and
[24:45] brother M told us the first Bible was
[24:46] written in the heavens and so then he
[24:50] comes down he preaches uh uh spoken word
[24:53] is the Original Seed and then the next
[24:55] message he preaches is the end time sign
[24:57] seed and in that message he says three
[25:00] is the number of perfection we all know
[25:01] that three is God's number in his
[25:03] numerology God is known by his numbers
[25:05] three is perfection seven is worship 24
[25:08] is worship 40 is Temptation 50 is
[25:11] Pentecost Jubilee and so forth all of
[25:13] his numbers and numerals of God is
[25:14] perfected is imperfection now three is
[25:17] his number Perfection and he says now
[25:20] listen now uh listen now close when the
[25:22] little baby Christ was born three stars
[25:24] went together and made the one star that
[25:27] reflecting the coming of an infant
[25:29] Christ a perfect one now what's happened
[25:31] we see a roar in the paper across the
[25:33] television out across the Nations where
[25:35] five stars just fell in line with the
[25:37] world what's five a number of Grace
[25:40] every time those stars come then
[25:41] something happens on the earth what
[25:43] taking place five stars fell in what is
[25:46] it an introduction of what say siten
[25:49] just look what's taking place Germany
[25:50] almost washed off the map some of the
[25:52] Magi said that the world would burst
[25:54] like a watermelon every distressful
[25:56] thing prophesied by them for the last
[25:58] day days look what's taking place
[26:00] England the other day had a storm that
[26:01] blowed away 70,000 houses one day
[26:04] disasters California Los Angels like to
[26:06] wash into the ocean what is it beginning
[26:08] of Sorrows earthquakes has picked up
[26:11] everywhere what is it five stars come in
[26:13] line God's grace what happened an infant
[26:17] Church a bride infancy that the power of
[26:20] God has begin to fall on her she's taken
[26:22] form him a bride for his bridegroom that
[26:25] three stars meant his Perfection of the
[26:27] heavenly father a trinity coming in one
[26:29] on the earth Among Us God's office is
[26:31] becoming one office what happened now
[26:34] it's the Church of the Living God coming
[26:36] together under the word of God and the
[26:39] astronomic heaven is announcing her
[26:41] approach amen praise God you know if
[26:44] there wasn't a prophet standing on Earth
[26:46] there's no way we could have come to
[26:47] that
[26:48] conclusion we could have speculated and
[26:51] guessed but but by the grace of God he
[26:53] had a prophet here who could say this is
[26:55] that and I'm so thankful because we can
[26:58] to look at it and say this is that amen
[27:00] but but the issue now is without that
[27:03] Prophet on the scene who has the
[27:05] authority to say this means that
[27:08] everybody's trying and and every
[27:10] denominational Prophet has a prophecy
[27:12] concerning uh uh what's happening amen
[27:16] and and brother B said I don't believe
[27:18] they should make fun of it because it
[27:19] means something so I say the same thing
[27:22] it means something but what does it mean
[27:25] I don't know I don't know what it means
[27:27] neither do I want to
[27:29] speculate let's go to Jeremiah chapter
[27:42] 10 Jeremiah chapter
[27:47] 10 verse
[27:53] 1 Jeremiah 10:1 hear ye the word which
[27:57] the Lord spake speaketh unto you oh
[28:00] House of Israel thus sayith the Lord
[28:02] learn not the way of the Heathen and be
[28:03] not dismayed at the signs of Heaven for
[28:06] the Heathen are dismayed at them so
[28:09] these aren't to dismay us trouble us or
[28:11] worry us nothing's changed in God yeah
[28:15] his time piece ticks on it doesn't take
[28:17] him by surprise he knows exactly what it
[28:19] means cuz he wrote The Heavens to begin
[28:21] with and they declare his glory amen and
[28:23] he knows what he's doing amen but you
[28:25] know what we don't need to know
[28:28] amen we don't need to know cuz
[28:31] everything we need to know has been
[28:32] given to us in the message everything
[28:36] now I'll ask you a question you can say
[28:37] well brother Brandon pointed to five
[28:38] stars a line and he showed when Jesus
[28:40] came three stars a line now five stars a
[28:42] line and that meant the brides coming
[28:44] forth I and I thank God for that
[28:46] Revelation I'm glad a prophet could
[28:48] point to that it's so exciting and so
[28:50] encouraging but here's the thing if the
[28:52] prophet never pointed that out and you
[28:53] never knew that would that have changed
[28:57] anything
[28:59] it would have changed nothing the bride
[29:01] would have still come forth the message
[29:03] would have still open he would have
[29:04] still called his bride together you
[29:05] would still believe the message nothing
[29:07] would have changed whether you knew that
[29:09] or didn't know that if you if you never
[29:12] knew what those five planets meant it
[29:14] would change nothing in the program of
[29:15] God and the reality is we don't need to
[29:18] know God has come and opened his word
[29:19] and given us the Revelation out of the
[29:21] word that we need and we everything we
[29:24] need's been given to us in the message
[29:26] and so we need to go guard against some
[29:29] of this uh making speculations and
[29:31] things like that and and I can say that
[29:33] because I've been guilty of doing it so
[29:35] many times like I've I I hope that I've
[29:38] learned my lesson by now because I've
[29:40] fallen prey to this trap several times
[29:43] things are happening you search it out
[29:44] and then you run the numbers and then
[29:46] you run the dates and then you piece
[29:48] this together and brother Brenham said
[29:50] that and at the end of it all what does
[29:52] it mean
[29:53] anyways amen at the end of it all what
[29:56] was the conclusion
[29:58] I remember I I just was reflecting and
[30:01] and thinking I remember about 20 years
[30:03] ago uh there was an alignment of seven
[30:06] planets I don't know if everybody
[30:07] remembers that and it was preached on
[30:10] and many people preached on the
[30:11] alignment of seven planets and the seven
[30:14] planets lined up and it's been about 20
[30:15] years ago and nobody knew what it meant
[30:18] but there was all kinds of inferences it
[30:20] it could be and maybe this and it shows
[30:22] the end of the seven Church ages and but
[30:25] when it was all said and done it's been
[30:27] 20 years since and what did it actually
[30:30] mean am I I still don't
[30:34] know remember I remember when uh the the
[30:39] Gulf War was going on and and and and uh
[30:43] the war out of Baghdad and Saddam
[30:45] Hussein and he believed he was a
[30:47] descendant of uh of Nebuchadnezzar and
[30:50] he was going to restore the old
[30:52] Babylonian Kingdom and all of a sudden
[30:54] all kinds of things went out that this
[30:57] is the end they're going to march across
[30:59] the Euphrates this is the resurrection
[31:00] of Babylon
[31:02] and and it was being
[31:05] preached and I don't fault anybody cuz I
[31:07] would have done the same thing like I it
[31:10] looks so much like this is that and
[31:13] scriptures were being attached to it and
[31:16] here we are 30 years or so later or 20
[31:19] some years later what did it actually
[31:23] mean what did it actually mean I don't
[31:26] know did it have sign significance yes
[31:29] is it affecting things yet today yes is
[31:31] it all working in the end time sequence
[31:33] yes does it have to do at the end times
[31:35] absolutely yes but what specifically
[31:38] doesn't
[31:40] mean and one of the reasons that I
[31:42] wanted to share this because I I'm just
[31:43] hoping that that that we can mature I'm
[31:46] hoping that I can mature I don't know if
[31:48] you remember several years ago we had a
[31:49] series of four blood moons and the four
[31:52] blood moons fell on Jewish holidays and
[31:55] I come and preached a sermon on it and
[31:57] showed the dates and all that and tied
[31:59] it all together and I and I was so sure
[32:02] it meant something big was coming and I
[32:04] do believe something big was coming I
[32:06] believe it meant something but what did
[32:08] it actually mean here we are four or
[32:10] five years later what was
[32:12] it and I have to say I don't
[32:15] know but I still believe it was
[32:17] something important I still believe it
[32:19] had something to do with the Earth it
[32:20] probably had something to do with the
[32:22] Jews it had to do with Redemption it had
[32:23] to do with the end times it had to do
[32:25] with the sequence of events the wrapping
[32:27] up I believe all of that but I cannot
[32:29] say it was this particular event or it
[32:32] meant this or this was because of that
[32:34] the prophet of God could do it if he was
[32:36] here amen and God would give him the
[32:38] Revelation he would be able to come and
[32:39] say this means that and it would be
[32:41] absolutely spot-on
[32:43] correct but I can't do that and so I I
[32:48] to this day I regret coming and
[32:50] preaching that not that I preached
[32:51] anything false but what I did was I
[32:53] built an anticipation and we were
[32:55] looking and projecting and and something
[32:57] big but in the end it just it it Fizzles
[33:00] it's like lighting a firecracker and you
[33:02] see the sizzle go down and go down and
[33:04] go down and you're waiting for the
[33:07] boom and where's the boom and so some of
[33:11] these lessons we have to learn and some
[33:13] of these lessons I have to learn and and
[33:15] I just I just I feel sorry for you all
[33:18] I'm sorry that you have to endure my
[33:21] training I don't know how else to come
[33:24] to maturity and have experience without
[33:26] having experiences and making mist mes I
[33:28] don't know how to do it so I'm really
[33:30] sorry but you guys are wonderful people
[33:31] you've been good to me even through it
[33:34] all God bless you we love you but we
[33:37] have to grow up together and we have to
[33:39] we have to stop chasing after different
[33:42] things and and speculating and here's
[33:44] the real issue that I that I have I take
[33:47] with speculation and and I wrote it down
[33:49] so I wouldn't forget what I was looking
[33:53] at when when we declare this is that
[33:57] this event equals this thing in
[33:59] scripture or this this thing
[34:02] happening the problem is is when we do
[34:05] that and we begin to believe that I now
[34:07] believe that this event equals this
[34:11] scripture so that's fine as long as
[34:14] that's
[34:15] correct but if that proves to be
[34:17] incorrect but God has a different
[34:19] fulfillment of that scripture or that
[34:21] something brother brandham said then
[34:23] what I've done is my speculation will
[34:25] attach me or somebody else to this event
[34:28] as the Fulfillment when actually this
[34:31] event is the Fulfillment and when this
[34:33] event comes I won't believe it therefore
[34:36] my speculation led to unbelief amen
[34:39] because when God does bring it to pass
[34:41] and it is God now I don't believe it
[34:43] because I've already accepted something
[34:44] else as being the Fulfillment let's take
[34:47] for example the coming of Elijah the
[34:49] prophet in Malachi 4 how many of you
[34:51] believe that You' you've witnessed the
[34:53] coming of Malachi of Elijah the prophet
[34:55] of Malachi he'll come before the great
[34:57] and Dre day of the Lord and turn the
[34:58] hearts of the children to the fathers
[34:59] and fathers to the children and we
[35:01] believe that was fulfilled in the
[35:02] ministry of brother brandham and because
[35:04] of that I cannot believe in any other
[35:06] fulfillment of that
[35:07] scripture No matter how many people come
[35:09] along and no matter what they do I can't
[35:12] believe in that because I already
[35:13] believe it's fulfilled amen how many
[35:16] believes you've heard the voice of the
[35:17] seventh
[35:18] angel so we already believe that so now
[35:21] I can't believe it in any other way
[35:23] because I already believe it and because
[35:25] it's the truth and been Vindicated by
[35:27] God we're protected against believing
[35:29] false because we received the truth but
[35:32] the problem is if I start making
[35:34] speculations and guessing on different
[35:36] things then I'll take my guess and
[35:38] attach it to a scripture or something
[35:40] brother Brenham said and if I move
[35:42] belief and Faith over to this and it's
[35:44] not actually the Fulfillment my
[35:46] speculation will actually lead to
[35:48] unbelief when the Fulfillment
[35:53] comes so it's actually a lot more
[35:55] dangerous than I I used to realize I
[35:58] thought it was kind of harmless we could
[35:59] just throw stuff out and speculate and
[36:01] and we still love talking about things
[36:03] and talking about the word and and we
[36:05] look at modern events and current events
[36:07] and We Know It All ties into the plan of
[36:09] God but speculation is not as innocent
[36:12] as I used to think it was it has a very
[36:15] uh dangerous side to
[36:18] it and so is there war in Europe yes is
[36:22] Russia fighting Ukraine yes what does it
[36:25] mean I don't know
[36:28] yeah does it mean we're in the end times
[36:30] well of course but we already knew that
[36:34] that's right like what does it tell me
[36:36] that I didn't already
[36:38] know maybe the maybe the maybe the the
[36:44] darkening of the sun is a sign of
[36:47] judgment maybe that the the the eclipse
[36:50] is a sign of judg it's a second one in a
[36:52] cycle of two that crossed the nation and
[36:54] made an X right over the middle of the
[36:56] nation and maybe that's where the bomb's
[36:58] going to
[36:59] fall and maybe it's the destruction of
[37:02] the of the US but the reality is I
[37:04] didn't need to know that cuz a prophet
[37:05] already told me the US will be destroyed
[37:07] by a nuclear bomb and he already said
[37:10] it'll be ashes and crater and debris
[37:12] from coast to coast so it I don't need
[37:14] to interpret this sign because a prophet
[37:16] already told me America's going to be
[37:18] destroyed so whether this means that or
[37:21] not it's inconsequential because we've
[37:24] already been told everything we need to
[37:26] know in the message am so we just need
[37:28] to stick with the
[37:30] message stick with the message and I'm
[37:33] probably the guiltiest Among Us of
[37:36] trying to tie things together and figure
[37:38] out current events and what this means
[37:40] and what is you know when Russia went to
[37:43] Ukraine was that Russia going after the
[37:46] oil
[37:48] maybe maybe
[37:50] not I don't know this war now in Israel
[37:54] Israel's in war and does that mean this
[37:57] and is it tied to this scripture
[38:00] maybe maybe
[38:02] not when they went into Gaza the first
[38:05] time uh back in 2015 not the first time
[38:07] but 2014 or 15 I thought that was it
[38:10] this is it it's all started and here we
[38:12] are how many years later right when they
[38:16] went and took Jerusalem Amen in the in
[38:18] the yam kapore war or 1967 war whatever
[38:21] that was when they went and took
[38:22] Jerusalem now Israel's back in Jerusalem
[38:25] it's all over that was 19
[38:29] 1967 you see all of these things they
[38:33] all mean something and they all have to
[38:35] do with the end times and all has to do
[38:37] with God moving his plan along amen but
[38:39] how in the world are we going to
[38:41] interpret that without a prophet on the
[38:43] scene how are we going to say this is
[38:45] that and if we do say this is that and
[38:49] we may not have the boldness to say this
[38:50] is that but we'll say it kind of looks
[38:52] like this is that and I'm thinking it
[38:54] could be this way but if we get
[38:56] somebody's mind WRA around that look at
[38:58] how dangerous that is we may be able to
[39:01] jump out of that later and say no that
[39:03] wasn't it but what if we persuaded
[39:04] somebody else to believe that that's why
[39:08] I'm sorrier than ever that I've ever
[39:10] went down that path I said God forgive
[39:12] me and God help me how many you remember
[39:15] about two years ago Venus and Jupiter
[39:17] had a convergence the closest they've
[39:19] come in tens of thousands of years and
[39:21] where did they converge they converged
[39:23] in the sign of Virgo the
[39:25] Virgin right where her w would be the
[39:28] sign of ver Virgo the Virgin you have
[39:31] Venus the Queen the Queen of Heaven and
[39:34] Jupiter the king Planet came together in
[39:37] Virgo the Virgin my
[39:40] goodness I mean it's startling it's
[39:42] amazing you could preach just
[39:46] that but what did it actually mean on
[39:48] the earth what was the event that it
[39:50] triggered what transpire well it shows
[39:52] that the queen and the King are coming
[39:54] together and they're coming together in
[39:55] the Virgin we already knew that that's
[39:58] why that thing makes us so excited
[40:00] because the prophet already told us
[40:01] that's what's happening in this end
[40:04] time so I didn't need to know that to
[40:07] know
[40:08] that I already knew that we already know
[40:12] it's the end times because Daniel was
[40:14] asking to understand the vision that he
[40:16] didn't understand and God said go your
[40:18] way Daniel for it's that is sealed until
[40:20] the time of the
[40:22] end well now that vision's been unsealed
[40:26] through the ministry of of Malachi 4 in
[40:28] Revelation 10:7 it's been unsealed and
[40:31] the unsealing of the mystery marks the
[40:33] end of time I knew this was the end of
[40:36] time before any CL cataclysmic event
[40:39] took
[40:43] place but brother Chad it shows there's
[40:45] judgments coming I knew there was
[40:46] judgments coming when brother bham threw
[40:48] a rock in the air and that started a
[40:50] whirlwind and went over in the west
[40:51] coast almost fell into the ocean and he
[40:53] says judgments beginning on the earth
[40:56] amen said Mercy has been spurned I knew
[40:59] then that we were entering into a cycle
[41:00] of judgments the Sorrows had begun
[41:02] moving towards the tribulation period I
[41:05] didn't need stars to align to tell me
[41:06] that I didn't need planets I didn't need
[41:08] eclipses none of that I needed to know
[41:11] amen because God already showed us
[41:14] through a prophetic Ministry tying it to
[41:15] the word showing the day we lived in so
[41:18] we know it's the end time we know it's
[41:20] time for earthquakes and floods and
[41:22] fires and pestilence and War among
[41:24] nations we already know that because
[41:26] we're in the end
[41:29] times
[41:31] right so none of these things actually
[41:34] change what we
[41:38] know so we just look at it and say
[41:41] praise God God wrote his first Bible in
[41:44] heaven second Bible in the
[41:47] pyramid third Bible he wrote out and
[41:51] this Bible that was wrote out he took
[41:53] the seals off of it so that we could
[41:56] understand so I shouldn't try to
[41:59] understand the stars and I shouldn't try
[42:00] to understand the pyramid I should try
[42:02] to understand the third word he wrote
[42:05] that he took the seals off of this one
[42:08] can be
[42:09] understood the other ones are still a
[42:11] bit in
[42:13] obscurity so you know what I wish I wish
[42:17] the prophet of God could come here and
[42:18] tell us what was going to happen
[42:20] tomorrow and what it meant and if he did
[42:23] I'd say Amen he'd show it to us in the
[42:26] word it'd be vind ated by coming to pass
[42:28] and we say praise God there's a prophet
[42:30] among us but for me I say God help me I
[42:35] don't want to go down that path I've
[42:36] done it I've done it time and time again
[42:39] and I just don't want to do it again
[42:43] amen praise
[42:45] God
[42:46] Amen God is
[42:49] good I hope I hope we're coming to
[42:52] maturity I hope we
[42:54] are brother Venom says
[42:58] and the me in questions and answers on
[43:00] the
[43:01] seals and this is after he's preached
[43:04] six of the seals he comes in the morning
[43:07] and and uh he preaches questions and
[43:10] answers in the morning service and this
[43:12] is what he says now take my advice as
[43:14] your brother don't put your own
[43:16] interpretation to anything you just go
[43:19] on and live a good Christian Life CU
[43:21] you'll only wind yourself away from the
[43:23] real thing when you do it see you'll
[43:25] only wind your way again away from the
[43:27] thing and all of you are conscience and
[43:29] know that there's something mysterious
[43:31] happening and it's happening and I know
[43:33] what it is now I'm not saying that it's
[43:36] the grace of God that lets me know that
[43:38] what it is it's something that's
[43:40] tremendous and it's gone right now and
[43:42] there's not a way in the world for you
[43:43] to see it but so help me with this Bible
[43:46] in my hand I know what it is it's been
[43:48] told to you before so just don't try to
[43:51] put an interpretation but just believe
[43:53] me as your brother we're living in a
[43:55] great hour We're living in a time well
[43:58] will ju well you just be real humble be
[44:02] a Christian and try to live for God and
[44:04] live honest with your fellow man and
[44:06] love those who don't love you to make
[44:09] any see you see you do you only make it
[44:11] a mysterious something and mess the real
[44:14] program of God up brother I'm I'm coming
[44:16] to the seals to the opening of the
[44:18] seventh seal and he says don't try to
[44:19] interpret anything don't try to figure
[44:21] anything out but here's his
[44:23] instructions you just be real humble be
[44:26] a Christian try to live for God and live
[44:29] honest with your fellow man and love
[44:31] those who don't love you so I've been
[44:34] given a task to do and that's my task
[44:36] and once I complete that I'll start
[44:38] figuring out everything else because I
[44:40] haven't completed this task yet I
[44:43] haven't come to the end of being
[44:46] humble living for God and living honest
[44:48] with your fellow man and loving those
[44:50] who don't love me I haven't I haven't
[44:52] perfected that phase yet so I I can't
[44:55] move to the next one where I can make
[44:56] prediction and interpretations and come
[44:58] up with my own understanding I'm still
[45:00] trying to do what he told me to
[45:02] do and along the way God has marvelously
[45:06] opened his word to us and continues to
[45:07] open it and brings Revelation upon
[45:09] Revelation upon Revelation but the
[45:11] Revelation is what brother R already
[45:13] told us it's always something he already
[45:14] said it's always something that's
[45:16] already in the message we were just
[45:17] blind to it amen and God keeps peeling
[45:20] it away and peeling it away and we're
[45:22] going deeper and deeper in the
[45:23] Revelation but we're not interpreting
[45:25] anything he's interpreting it he's
[45:27] bringing it to past he's making it
[45:28] happen I don't have to interpret one
[45:30] astronomical event because whether I
[45:33] interpret or not or understand it or not
[45:35] or even see it happen or not it makes no
[45:37] difference it'll still come to pass on
[45:39] this
[45:43] Earth but brother said we need to know
[45:45] what's happening we know what's
[45:46] happening but there's a conspirac yes
[45:48] there's a conspiracy who's behind it all
[45:50] the Catholic Church what did it has to
[45:52] do with money and power and we know the
[45:54] whole system is going to God already
[45:55] told us all of this who holds the gold
[45:58] who has the Paper Bond amen there I
[46:00] don't need a conspiracy theory I've been
[46:02] brought into the greatest conspiracy
[46:03] that's going on I know what's
[46:05] happening but how will it happen I don't
[46:08] know what will it look like I don't know
[46:10] what news event will let you know that
[46:11] this is the I don't know I just know
[46:13] it's happening and that has nothing to
[46:14] do with me anyways before because before
[46:16] that goes into full-blown action I'm out
[46:18] of here amen so I already know but
[46:21] shouldn't we be pre prepared how am I
[46:23] going to prepare am I going to what am I
[46:25] going to do buy Fuel and get an extra
[46:27] generator and put enough that's all
[46:30] self-preservation that's all me trying
[46:32] to protect myself when I have a heavenly
[46:34] father and I'm married to a bridegroom
[46:36] that can take care of me and provide
[46:38] everything I need to Everything I Need
[46:40] is provided for
[46:42] me he has given me everything I need
[46:45] amen and even godone amen he begins to
[46:47] show us he's so merciful to us that he
[46:50] even begins to show us a supernatural
[46:52] provision through the spoken word as
[46:53] directed by God I don't need to take
[46:56] care of myself whatever I have need of
[46:58] my heavenly father will provide my
[47:00] bridegroom will provide it for me I
[47:02] don't need to figure out should I keep
[47:04] gold bars downstairs and paper money
[47:06] won't be worth anything and I don't want
[47:08] anybody track me on the internet and I
[47:09] need some fuel and I need a generator
[47:11] and I need at least a year supply of few
[47:17] food honestly when it all falls apart
[47:20] who wants to be here
[47:22] anyways why do you want to preserve your
[47:24] life and come out of your bunker to what
[47:31] why save ourselves why prepare what are
[47:33] we preparing for I don't
[47:37] know there was a lot of rice after
[47:43] Y2K people had rice and beans in
[47:51] abundance help us
[47:55] Lord
[47:58] what I don't want to do is I don't want
[47:59] to complicate what God has given us I
[48:03] want to add to there's so many ways to
[48:05] add to or take
[48:06] away and it doesn't necess necessarily
[48:09] mean you add words and you change the
[48:12] scripture and you change the quote you
[48:13] can read the quote correctly but you can
[48:16] add to or take away in the way that you
[48:19] use
[48:22] it we know that we don't want to
[48:24] hybridize the word none of of us want to
[48:27] hybridize the word I don't you don't
[48:30] nobody who believes God wants to
[48:31] hybridize the word but you know I I
[48:34] believe this is me personally I'm just
[48:36] speaking from my own heart I believe
[48:38] that you can there's more than one way
[48:39] to hybridize the
[48:41] word because if I manipulate that word
[48:45] to match my own desire and try to
[48:47] accomplish my own goal with it I may not
[48:49] misquote
[48:51] it but I have misused
[48:54] it I've used it for self and I've used
[48:56] used it for selfish purposes and I've
[48:58] used it for pride and I've used it for
[49:00] envy and I've used it for lust and I may
[49:02] not quote it wrong but I have used it
[49:04] wrong and I brought the wrong spirit and
[49:06] maybe we can maybe we can hybridize the
[49:08] word by H by attaching the wrong Spirit
[49:11] to the word not changing the
[49:14] words and I want to get to a place where
[49:16] God has absolute control in my life and
[49:19] that it's not me anymore it's him I
[49:20] don't want to mix myself into this and
[49:23] that is the hardest thing we can say it
[49:25] all the time it's the hardest thing in
[49:27] the world to keep from
[49:29] doing and so we just need God's help we
[49:32] need God's
[49:33] spirit let's go to Genesis chapter
[49:36] chapter 3
[49:45] together and when you go home you have
[49:47] to explain to your kids what Y2K
[49:55] was
[49:58] Genesis chapter
[50:01] 3 verse
[50:04] 4 and the serpent said unto the woman ye
[50:07] shall not surely die for God does know
[50:10] that in the day you eat thereof then
[50:12] your eyes shall be opened and you should
[50:14] be as Gods knowing good and evil and
[50:18] when the woman saw that the tree was
[50:19] good for food that it was pleasant to
[50:21] the eyes and the tree to be desired to
[50:24] make one wise she took of the fruit
[50:26] thereof did eat and gave also to her
[50:28] husband with her and he did
[50:30] eat my brother R said Satan this
[50:35] deceiver spoke in Matthew 24:24 with so
[50:39] much deceit now we find that by his
[50:42] gospel program of knowledge better
[50:44] education higher ethics civilization and
[50:46] so forth has Bewitched the people that
[50:48] wants to serve God into believing his
[50:50] lie Eve did not want to do that but he
[50:52] showed her it was a it was more wisdom
[50:54] in it she didn't know she wanted to know
[50:58] she didn't understand but she wanted to
[51:01] understand and God told her not to try
[51:03] to understand how can I understand any
[51:06] of these things I cannot understand them
[51:07] I believe them I don't have to
[51:10] understand them God is faithful and and
[51:12] not God is faith God is faith not
[51:16] understanding we just believe what he
[51:19] said this is all this has been the
[51:21] Temptation from the garden from the very
[51:22] beginning the Temptation is to figure it
[51:24] out the Temptation is to understand that
[51:27] Eve didn't know but she wanted to know
[51:29] she didn't understand but she wanted to
[51:31] understand and what the devil had to
[51:33] do you I go back and I meditate on this
[51:37] because sometimes the simplest things
[51:38] are the most profound and God showed us
[51:41] what what happened in Genesis was the
[51:43] seed and everything will come from that
[51:45] seed until it comes to to full fruition
[51:47] in the Book of Revelation so everything
[51:49] began here in Genesis and in Genesis God
[51:52] had his son and his son's wife in Eden
[51:55] in pleasure in the Garden of Eden walled
[51:57] in amen and garden means an enclosure so
[52:00] God had them walled in with his word
[52:02] they were protected in this place of
[52:03] safety amen and they were given the word
[52:05] to stand behind and and she was told not
[52:08] to eat of this tree but the serpent
[52:10] comes along anointed by the devil and
[52:12] and begins to it begins to speak to her
[52:15] and and when we realize Eve literally
[52:18] and she wasn't Eve at that time she was
[52:20] the woman because her name is the name
[52:21] that was given to her after the fall but
[52:24] at this point she's Adam yeah right
[52:26] she's the woman is her title her name is
[52:29] Adam and here she is she actually has
[52:33] need for
[52:34] nothing she needs
[52:37] nothing she she's living in Perfection
[52:40] she has a perfect body that won't die uh
[52:43] she's made perfect in Beauty brother B
[52:45] said she was beautiful she was the most
[52:46] beautiful woman she was perfect she she
[52:49] had perfect love Perfect Harmony perfect
[52:52] perfect relationship with her husband
[52:54] everything was in Perfection she
[52:56] actually didn't need anything when she
[52:58] was hungry she ate when she was tired
[53:01] she slept if the wind was blowing too
[53:02] much she told Adam and Adam moved a tree
[53:05] to block the shade of the give her shade
[53:07] and told the wind to stand still like
[53:09] there was no need she had no
[53:11] need so the Devil Couldn't control her
[53:14] the only way the devil can control her
[53:16] is first he has to create in her a
[53:18] need so when he creates in her a need
[53:20] then he can begin to control her by her
[53:25] need yeah
[53:27] listen if you don't need anything nobody
[53:29] can manipulate
[53:32] you if you don't need acceptance if you
[53:35] don't need popularity if you don't need
[53:37] finances if you don't need government
[53:39] support if you don't need everybody
[53:40] around you to tell you you're right and
[53:42] your friend and give you security if you
[53:43] don't need anything nobody can control
[53:46] you you know why they couldn't control
[53:48] Jesus cuz Jesus needed nothing he had a
[53:51] heavenly
[53:52] father he didn't need their system he
[53:54] didn't need the government he didn't
[53:55] need friends he didn't even need his
[53:57] disciples because they all abandoned him
[53:58] and he was fine without them amen that's
[54:02] right Jesus needed nothing because he
[54:05] had a Heavenly
[54:08] Father the woman in the garden needed
[54:11] nothing and when she needed nothing you
[54:14] can't be manipulated this bride is going
[54:16] to come to where her full Reliance is on
[54:18] Jesus Christ I believe that with all my
[54:21] heart I don't know what it will take to
[54:22] get us there and I don't know how and I
[54:24] feel myself far from that Des ation but
[54:26] I know that's the destination amen where
[54:29] we can't be intimidated we can't be
[54:31] frightened we can't be manipulated to
[54:33] ever deviate from this word because he's
[54:35] promised that he'll have a bride that'll
[54:37] stand the test because he predestinated
[54:39] to be so not because she's super strong
[54:42] it's not because you and I are super
[54:43] bright or super strong are we no it's
[54:46] because God determined that he would
[54:47] have a bride in this generation that
[54:49] wouldn't fall she wouldn't fall the way
[54:51] the the woman fell Eve fell she wouldn't
[54:53] fall the way the first church fell he's
[54:55] already pred destinated in his plan that
[54:58] he will have a bride that will stand
[55:00] face to face with the same temptation as
[55:02] in the garden only this one won't fall
[55:04] because he's provided his word and he's
[55:06] come himself to dwell in
[55:10] her so we've got to get to the place
[55:12] where I don't need anything but
[55:16] Christ it's got to be that way I don't
[55:20] need my church say brother Chad how can
[55:22] you say that because brother B said
[55:23] they're going to lock the doors of this
[55:25] church someday so we better get to the
[55:27] place well I I I should practice that
[55:29] now and not go to church that's that's
[55:31] off the
[55:32] word so don't don't get ahead of
[55:35] schedule don't worry you don't have to
[55:37] make anything come to pass it will come
[55:40] to
[55:42] pass you don't have to make it happen
[55:45] and you don't have to preempt what God's
[55:47] going to do just hold steady it's going
[55:49] to
[55:52] happen and if you believe you're one of
[55:55] them and God has called you for this day
[55:56] and he's called you as one of his elect
[55:58] it's going to happen to you and it's
[56:00] going to happen in
[56:04] you why because he determined it
[56:07] so so the the the devil has to
[56:12] First create a need in the
[56:16] woman now he he's creating a longing she
[56:20] doesn't need anything he says you'll be
[56:23] like God on the earth she was already a
[56:24] god yep she just didn't have knowledge
[56:27] of Good and Evil she only had knowledge
[56:28] of
[56:31] good so he offers her or begins to tell
[56:35] her that there's
[56:37] more than what you have God does know in
[56:41] the day you eat there of your eyes will
[56:42] be open and you'll be as God's knowing
[56:45] Good and Evil all of a sudden he offered
[56:47] her more than what she
[56:52] had you know how amazing it is when
[56:55] somebody will offer offer you more
[56:57] Revelation on the
[57:00] message and what's really happening
[57:02] they're creating a need inside of
[57:05] you because you need this Revelation to
[57:08] go in the Rapture you need this
[57:11] Revelation you know what the truth is we
[57:13] need
[57:14] Revelation and every time God opens the
[57:17] word and gives more re we need that
[57:18] Revelation and we need to move into
[57:21] it the the the the the problem is when
[57:24] somebody comes along and now they have
[57:26] the Revelation you
[57:28] need and what's happening the devil once
[57:31] again is creating in the woman a need
[57:34] she she's lack you're lack that see
[57:36] nobody says this but what they're
[57:38] implying is you're lacking something you
[57:40] need I have or our church or our camp or
[57:44] our ministry has what you
[57:46] need
[57:47] right and all of a sudden it becomes a
[57:50] manipulation
[57:51] tactic because now you need what I've
[57:55] got now need to come under my
[58:01] heading you know what the real
[58:03] revelation of being bride all you need
[58:06] is him and he supplies all your
[58:10] needs if he if you need a revelation to
[58:13] go higher he'll give you that Revelation
[58:16] how will he give it through Fellowship
[58:17] through a church through preaching of
[58:19] the word through a pastor absolutely
[58:21] those are all God's mechanisms and
[58:22] there's nothing wrong with any of it but
[58:24] it's him giving it to you it's your
[58:26] husband supplying it it's God delivering
[58:29] it to you all you need is him and he
[58:31] supplies everything you need am amen so
[58:35] in order to manipulate the woman now he
[58:37] creates a need and now she needs to know
[58:40] she didn't know but now she wanted to
[58:42] know and now she she didn't understand
[58:44] but she wanted to understand and now
[58:46] when she when when this need when this
[58:49] there's a need there's something more
[58:50] she has everything what does she need
[58:55] more
[58:56] now the need begins to cause her to
[59:00] reason now when she looked at the
[59:03] tree she saw that it was good for
[59:06] food was pleasant to the eyes and the
[59:09] tree to be desired to make all of the
[59:11] sudden she starts looking at this tree
[59:12] like she's never looked at it before and
[59:14] she's analyzing the
[59:18] tree it it it looks good it's Pleasant
[59:22] it'll make make one wise and when she
[59:25] analyzed the tree with her own intellect
[59:27] she couldn't see the problem with the
[59:30] tree but it didn't matter whether she
[59:32] could see the problem with the tree or
[59:34] not God said don't
[59:37] partake God knew what was there and he
[59:39] knew the end result she didn't so she
[59:42] thought that she needed to understand
[59:44] she didn't need to understand what she
[59:46] needed to do was obey because God had
[59:49] provided everything she needed even the
[59:51] Commandment to not touch was God's
[59:53] provided
[59:55] way so for us God has given us this
[59:58] message God has given us his word he's
[1:00:01] given us Revelation he's given us a
[1:00:03] heart to perceive he's given us the
[1:00:04] faith it's a gift the faith to believe
[1:00:07] he's given us every element we need it
[1:00:09] was God sent the prophet we didn't
[1:00:11] figure anything out God Vindicated the
[1:00:13] prophet with signs and wonders God moved
[1:00:15] the heavenlies and get had a prophet to
[1:00:18] say this means that and tied it all
[1:00:19] together and vindicate improved his
[1:00:21] presence God did all of that we didn't
[1:00:23] have to provide anything for ourselves
[1:00:25] when I needed Malachi 4 God provided it
[1:00:28] when I needed Revelation 10:7 and the
[1:00:29] opening of the seals God provided it
[1:00:31] when I needed a greater revelation God
[1:00:33] gave
[1:00:36] it God so we don't have to go find it
[1:00:40] does that mean I don't study study the
[1:00:41] message oh my goodness study because
[1:00:44] it's your bridegroom because it's your
[1:00:46] love because it's your passion read it
[1:00:48] study it uh absorb it feed on it
[1:00:50] constantly but you're not going to
[1:00:52] figure anything out by
[1:00:54] that don't dare think that the more you
[1:00:56] read the more you'll understand amen the
[1:00:58] more you read amen God May Quicken more
[1:01:01] to you but if he doesn't quick it it's
[1:01:02] not going to
[1:01:04] help it takes God is it wrong to read
[1:01:07] and study no read and study constantly
[1:01:10] constantly be in the word constantly be
[1:01:12] in that atmosphere in that environment
[1:01:13] feed on it because it's right feed on it
[1:01:15] because it's true feed on it because
[1:01:17] it's the word of God feed on it because
[1:01:19] it's your life don't feed on it so you
[1:01:21] can understand something better than
[1:01:22] somebody
[1:01:23] else amen amen just feed on it cuz it's
[1:01:27] life it is our life it is everything to
[1:01:33] us let's go to 1 Timothy
[1:01:51] 1 1 Timothy
[1:01:54] 1
[1:02:01] verse
[1:02:04] one says
[1:02:06] Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[1:02:08] Commandment of God Our Savior and Lord
[1:02:10] Jesus Christ which is Our Hope unto
[1:02:13] Timothy my own son in the faith grace
[1:02:15] mercy and peace from God our Father and
[1:02:17] Jesus Christ Our Lord as I besought
[1:02:21] Thee as I besought Thee to abide still
[1:02:24] in Ephesus when I went into m cedonia
[1:02:26] that thou mightest charge some that
[1:02:28] teach no other do that they teach no
[1:02:30] other Doctrine neither give heed to
[1:02:33] fables and endless genealogies which
[1:02:35] minister questions rather than Godly
[1:02:36] edifying which is in faith so do now the
[1:02:40] end of the Commandment is Charity which
[1:02:43] that's love that's agape love the end of
[1:02:46] the Commandment is love out of a pure
[1:02:49] heart and of a good conscience and of
[1:02:52] Faith un Fain from which some having
[1:02:54] swerved have turned a side into vain
[1:02:56] jangling Desiring to be teachers of the
[1:02:59] law understanding neither what they say
[1:03:01] nor whereof they
[1:03:03] affirm Paul sent Timothy and he was
[1:03:05] asking Timothy in this scripture to go
[1:03:08] and remind them to teach no other
[1:03:12] Doctrine and neither give heed to fables
[1:03:15] and endless gen
[1:03:16] genealogies this is what he said which
[1:03:18] minister questions rather than Godly
[1:03:22] edifying which is in faith so what
[1:03:25] should the min be doing Godly edifying
[1:03:27] which is in faith because he said this
[1:03:30] is the whole purpose because the end of
[1:03:32] the Commandment what is the goal what
[1:03:34] are we trying to achieve is love out of
[1:03:36] a pure heart and a good conscience and a
[1:03:39] faith and Fain what's the target what
[1:03:42] are we aiming at what is the end of the
[1:03:44] commandment and end of the word and end
[1:03:46] of the preaching and the goal of
[1:03:47] everything this is the goal am till till
[1:03:51] till we come to love what is the
[1:03:55] Capstone
[1:03:56] on the stature of a perfect man charity
[1:03:59] love agape love what is what are we
[1:04:02] building unto love the Capstone of love
[1:04:05] what is God the Bible says God is love
[1:04:08] amen and brother B said Jesus Christ was
[1:04:11] God's love give to man he was expression
[1:04:13] of of love to mankind so Christ is the
[1:04:16] express is love expressed amen what are
[1:04:18] we growing to we're growing to the
[1:04:20] stature of Jesus Christ we're growing to
[1:04:22] his same image what's the destination
[1:04:24] the destination is perfectly love and
[1:04:27] brother brenon when he went beyond the
[1:04:28] curtain of time he was told am me when
[1:04:30] when he got there the voice said amen
[1:04:32] only perfect love will enter in
[1:04:35] there so what is the goal of it all to
[1:04:38] figure something out to understand
[1:04:39] something no the goal of it all is to
[1:04:42] come to the stature of the fullness of
[1:04:43] Christ to move into the image of love
[1:04:46] the person of love the capping of Love
[1:04:48] The Headstone of love until we all come
[1:04:50] to to to to love from a pure heart and a
[1:04:54] good conscience and faith unfeigned
[1:04:56] unfeigned means without pretense or
[1:04:57] hypocrisy you're not faking anything
[1:04:59] it's genuine to the core of who you are
[1:05:01] this is what you are and this is what
[1:05:03] you believe that is why the preaching is
[1:05:05] to the edifying of Faith amen it's not
[1:05:08] just to know facts and figures amen
[1:05:10] those facts and figures are supposed to
[1:05:12] point us to what to Christ the word the
[1:05:14] message the the end time Revelation that
[1:05:16] builds us Faith to come to this
[1:05:19] place to what to love out of a pure
[1:05:22] heart and a good conscience and faith un
[1:05:27] fed the other things will end up just
[1:05:29] being a waste of time or
[1:05:33] worse or Worse
[1:05:37] yes see if if I take the
[1:05:41] message and I have my own
[1:05:44] ambition and I start to attach quotes to
[1:05:47] my
[1:05:49] ambition and I start preaching from an
[1:05:52] an ambition to achieve something to
[1:05:55] prove something and I put Pride behind
[1:05:58] the
[1:05:59] quotes I don't care how many scriptures
[1:06:01] you stack on top of Pride amen it still
[1:06:04] can't offset Pride Underneath It All is
[1:06:08] pride if if I use the scriptures because
[1:06:12] of my Envy towards another and no and
[1:06:14] I'm justifying my envy and I'm
[1:06:15] justifying my actions I'm justifying my
[1:06:17] frustration towards them and anger
[1:06:19] towards them and I stack together quotes
[1:06:20] and I put together scriptures to show
[1:06:22] that I'm right it doesn't matter how
[1:06:24] right you are underneath it is Envy yes
[1:06:28] you may be able to prove this is exactly
[1:06:30] what the Pharisees were trying to do
[1:06:31] they were envious of Jesus he was
[1:06:33] getting the popularity the whole world
[1:06:34] was going after him they were losing all
[1:06:36] of their status and because of Envy
[1:06:38] pilate said the Bible said pilate knew
[1:06:41] because of Envy they delivered him to
[1:06:42] him not because of anything they' done
[1:06:44] because of simple envy and they had to
[1:06:46] shut him down and they started using
[1:06:48] scriptures no Prophet comes out of uh uh
[1:06:51] out of Nazareth and and and they start
[1:06:53] they start tying the scriptures together
[1:06:55] and they start pointing to the
[1:06:56] priesthood and they start pointing out
[1:06:58] all kinds of things to show that they
[1:07:00] were right and Jesus was wrong it didn't
[1:07:01] matter how many scriptures they used and
[1:07:03] it didn't even matter if they quoted
[1:07:05] them
[1:07:07] correctly they may have said them
[1:07:09] verbatim exactly as Moses wrote them but
[1:07:12] it didn't matter it mattered for not
[1:07:15] because what was underneath was Envy
[1:07:18] amen envy and pride and and and ambition
[1:07:23] and self- motivation and I say God help
[1:07:26] us I want to get that all washed out of
[1:07:28] me I I want to come if God has ever
[1:07:30] called me to preach the gospel I want to
[1:07:32] preach it in its Purity and not hybrid
[1:07:34] it with my own ambition and my own pride
[1:07:37] and my own mixed mix and match I don't
[1:07:39] want to do that to this precious
[1:07:41] glorious word that's so precious and
[1:07:43] perfect I don't want to taint it I don't
[1:07:45] want to uh ruin it I don't want to
[1:07:46] present it in the wrong way because I'm
[1:07:48] mixing myself and with it I want to die
[1:07:51] to myself and you say well praise God
[1:07:53] you want to die to yourself I want to
[1:07:54] die to myself but I'm failing in it
[1:07:56] miserably every day I've got to have God
[1:07:59] come on the scene and rescue me from
[1:08:02] me I got to I I got to actually take
[1:08:05] time Amen to judge my motives I got to
[1:08:08] actually stop in prayer once in a while
[1:08:10] and say God show me show me where I'm
[1:08:18] at let's go to Ephesians chapter
[1:08:24] 4
[1:08:27] talk about making a preacher
[1:08:29] tremble this makes me tremble and it
[1:08:34] should it absolutely
[1:08:38] should because if I've taken the word of
[1:08:42] God that's so perfect and
[1:08:44] precious and I lay it over to my pride
[1:08:47] but I Minister it for self-purpose and
[1:08:50] in self-will for self-
[1:08:52] glorification and exaltation then what
[1:08:56] have I presented to the people have I
[1:08:57] presented them the holy ghost or have I
[1:08:59] presented my
[1:09:03] pride say God please help us all we can
[1:09:07] do is get on our knees and say God
[1:09:09] please help us and I believe he will
[1:09:11] because he's he's going to have a church
[1:09:14] without spot a wrinkle he's going to
[1:09:16] have a true fful Ministry he's going to
[1:09:18] have ministers and people and officers
[1:09:21] and a church he's got he's got to it's
[1:09:23] his word he's got to produce his own
[1:09:25] word so what do I do the only thing I
[1:09:28] can do is lay flat on my face and say
[1:09:30] God help me save me keep me rescue me
[1:09:33] stop me whatever you have to do Lord I
[1:09:35] want to surrender myself to
[1:09:38] you in Ephesians chapter
[1:09:40] 4 I want to go to verse 10 says he that
[1:09:44] descended is the same also that ascended
[1:09:46] up far above heaven that he might fill
[1:09:49] all things and he gave some Apostles and
[1:09:51] some prophets and some evangelists and
[1:09:53] some pastors and teachers for the the
[1:09:55] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[1:09:57] the ministry for the edifying of the
[1:09:59] body of Christ till we all come in the
[1:10:01] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[1:10:02] of the Son of God unto a perfect man
[1:10:05] unto the measure of the stature the
[1:10:06] fullness of
[1:10:07] Christ
[1:10:10] henceforth that we henceforth be no more
[1:10:12] children tossed to and fro and carried
[1:10:14] about with every wind of Doctrine by the
[1:10:16] slide of men and cunning craftiness
[1:10:18] whereby they lie and wait to deceive but
[1:10:20] speaking the truth in love may grow up
[1:10:22] into him in all things which is the head
[1:10:24] even Christ Christ from whom the whole
[1:10:26] body fitly joined together and compacted
[1:10:29] by that which every joint supplieth
[1:10:30] according to the effectual working in
[1:10:33] the measure of every part making
[1:10:34] increase of the body unto the edifying
[1:10:37] of itself in love what's he doing he's
[1:10:40] building a body into the very image of
[1:10:43] Jesus
[1:10:44] Christ what's he using he's using every
[1:10:47] joint and he's using a fful
[1:10:50] Ministry but it says in verse 15 but
[1:10:53] speaking the truth in
[1:10:58] love to me this is the
[1:11:01] key what is this fivefold ministry going
[1:11:03] to do speak the truth and love what's
[1:11:05] the motivation behind it
[1:11:07] love what kind of love agape love which
[1:11:10] is what God what's it going to take it's
[1:11:13] going to take God in the word it's going
[1:11:15] to take God behind administering his own
[1:11:18] word it's going to be by the Holy Spirit
[1:11:20] not by the spirit of a
[1:11:22] man that doesn't mean God doesn't use
[1:11:24] man brother B said God's in you with
[1:11:26] your temperament God uses those things
[1:11:28] but it can't come from the man it's got
[1:11:30] to come from God or else it'll be
[1:11:32] tainted it'll be corrupted it'll be
[1:11:34] polluted and it's got to stay pure
[1:11:36] because there got to be a washing of the
[1:11:37] Water by the word so that there's a
[1:11:39] bride without wrinkle or any such
[1:11:42] thing so it's going to have to be by the
[1:11:44] spirit of God and we have to speak the
[1:11:47] truth in love not speak the truth in
[1:11:51] Envy not speak the truth in Pride not
[1:11:54] speak the truth truth and
[1:11:59] hatred the discip the Pharisees use some
[1:12:03] scriptures and the scriptures is the
[1:12:05] truth but they spoke those scriptures
[1:12:07] because they hated
[1:12:10] Christ so they spoke the
[1:12:14] truth for
[1:12:18] hatred it doesn't
[1:12:20] correlate it doesn't
[1:12:24] match you know when we think of this
[1:12:26] speaking the truth in love it's it's
[1:12:28] such a simple statement like it's so
[1:12:30] easy speaking the truth in
[1:12:32] love you realize that that word love is
[1:12:36] agape and that Agape it it doesn't mean
[1:12:40] something that's emotional emotion can
[1:12:42] come with it but it's not motivated by
[1:12:44] emotion it's motivated by Revelation and
[1:12:48] understanding because God is love Christ
[1:12:51] is love the Holy Ghost has shed the love
[1:12:54] of God and brought our
[1:12:56] hearts it's speaking the truth in love
[1:12:59] it's speaking the truth with the very
[1:13:01] motive of God in giving the
[1:13:03] word because God so loved the world that
[1:13:07] he gave his only begotten son that
[1:13:09] whosoever should believeth in him shall
[1:13:12] not be condemned but have everlasting
[1:13:13] life amen is that what he said amen the
[1:13:16] next verse he sent not his son into the
[1:13:19] world to condemn the
[1:13:21] world but the world through him might be
[1:13:23] saved amen am amen so what was his
[1:13:27] motive in sending Jesus Christ his
[1:13:30] motive was love and his motive was
[1:13:36] salvation when somebody rejected that
[1:13:39] they're already condemned they're
[1:13:40] condemned already because they received
[1:13:42] not the Son of God they're already
[1:13:45] condemned he didn't send the son to
[1:13:47] condemn the world they were already
[1:13:49] condemned by the Fall In the Garden of
[1:13:51] Eden he sent the son into the world for
[1:13:54] salvation
[1:13:57] love sent Jesus Christ he was an
[1:13:59] expression of God's love Jesus died
[1:14:02] motivated by
[1:14:05] love so now how should I administer this
[1:14:08] message with the same motive that God
[1:14:10] gave it how should I minister to the
[1:14:12] scriptures with the same motive God gave
[1:14:14] it amen how should I witness I should
[1:14:16] witness to others with the same
[1:14:18] motivation behind me that motivated God
[1:14:21] to send Jesus Christ into the world Amen
[1:14:24] that they might be saved
[1:14:27] but I have failed so many times in
[1:14:29] witnessing because many times in
[1:14:32] witnessing I was using the word to
[1:14:35] condemn somebody else and to vindicate
[1:14:37] myself as knowing what the Bible said
[1:14:39] and being right and somehow being holy
[1:14:41] and you're not holy and you're wrong and
[1:14:43] you're condemned and I used the wrong
[1:14:45] motive with the
[1:14:47] word the word was pure but my heart was
[1:14:53] evil I want wanted to prove I was right
[1:14:56] and they were
[1:14:59] wrong is that why Jesus that is that why
[1:15:01] Jesus came into the world is that why
[1:15:04] God sent his son is that why God gave us
[1:15:07] a message is that why he gave a love
[1:15:09] letter to the
[1:15:10] bride will there be judgment absolutely
[1:15:13] anytime you spurn Mercy there's judgment
[1:15:16] Mercy's been Stern but that wasn't the
[1:15:18] purpose the world was already in
[1:15:19] judgment he didn't have to send it for
[1:15:21] judgment he sent it for mercy and when
[1:15:23] they spurn Mercy there's not nothing
[1:15:25] left but
[1:15:27] judgment so in witnessing my motive now
[1:15:30] needs to be love it needs I say God put
[1:15:33] a love in my heart and honestly I'm to
[1:15:35] the point where if God doesn't give me a
[1:15:37] supernatural Love and Desire for that
[1:15:39] person I better shut my mouth and not
[1:15:40] say anything to them because I need the
[1:15:43] right motivation with the word to get
[1:15:45] the right results and if they if they
[1:15:47] spurn Mercy then that's between them and
[1:15:49] God but my motive has to be love and
[1:15:51] salvation and and because there's a soul
[1:15:54] at stay and that's got to be my whole
[1:15:56] Vision not whether I'm right or wrong I
[1:15:58] can prove it by the Bible and show you
[1:16:00] that I know something and I'm righteous
[1:16:02] and you're not that's all got to die and
[1:16:04] we got to go back to a basic love of
[1:16:06] souls amen a basic desire to say there's
[1:16:09] a way out of this trap friend there's a
[1:16:11] way of Salvation there's an assurance
[1:16:13] amen you can have what God has given in
[1:16:15] this day because of love and a desire
[1:16:17] for Souls not for condemnation self-
[1:16:19] glorification envy and
[1:16:23] strife you're ha hatred for the Catholic
[1:16:26] church does not justify your costic
[1:16:29] attitude amen when taking the
[1:16:34] word amen I shouldn't say yours I should
[1:16:37] say
[1:16:39] mine I said things so wrong so many
[1:16:42] times and I I realize now where I am in
[1:16:45] my journey I look back and I say that
[1:16:47] was shameful and I'm
[1:16:49] ashamed I'm ashamed because it was
[1:16:52] motivated by self love of self defending
[1:16:57] self when we see the word as Jesus
[1:16:59] Christ it's the most precious thing in
[1:17:01] the world to us when somebody rejects it
[1:17:04] it Grieves us it it Grieves us and it
[1:17:06] should be grieved because they've
[1:17:07] rejected my Lord but also they've
[1:17:09] rejected their own
[1:17:11] salvation that should grieve me but it
[1:17:14] shouldn't make me
[1:17:16] angry when it makes me angry it's
[1:17:19] because I got myself mixed
[1:17:21] in
[1:17:23] right you know how many times s we
[1:17:25] thought we were defending the word and
[1:17:26] we were only defending our
[1:17:30] reputation and I would sing swing the
[1:17:32] sword harder than
[1:17:36] anybody and what it was was a spirit of
[1:17:39] Vengeance because I had been
[1:17:45] offended say God you have to help
[1:17:48] us when it comes down to it this is
[1:17:51] going to be
[1:17:52] real it's not going to be Church right
[1:17:56] not going to be religion it's going to
[1:17:58] be
[1:17:59] reality it's going to be what the
[1:18:01] apostles had when they came stumbling
[1:18:04] out of the upper room and they went
[1:18:05] moving through the Earth spreading the
[1:18:06] gospel it's going to be the same thing
[1:18:09] only this one's going to go on and
[1:18:10] finish the purpose and move to the full
[1:18:12] revelation of the
[1:18:14] word it's not going to be
[1:18:17] all mixed up with ourselves and our own
[1:18:21] ideas and our own offenses and our own
[1:18:23] wounds and our own complexes and
[1:18:25] God heal us of all of that so that we
[1:18:28] can Minister the speak the word in love
[1:18:32] amen and if I can't speak the word in
[1:18:34] love God help me to put my hand over my
[1:18:36] mouth and walk away and pray till my
[1:18:39] heart
[1:18:42] changes I think one of the most
[1:18:44] marvelous messages brother brandom ever
[1:18:46] preached was standing in the
[1:18:48] Gap it's helped me so many times if he
[1:18:53] hadn't preached standing in the Gap out
[1:18:54] of already left the
[1:18:56] ministry I'd already hung it up because
[1:18:59] all we can do is
[1:19:01] fail all we can do is make
[1:19:04] mistakes but thank God God showed that
[1:19:08] Prophet there was a mountain
[1:19:10] range that had success and failure
[1:19:13] already baked into
[1:19:15] it had highs and lows had valleys and
[1:19:19] had frustrations and and had everything
[1:19:23] already yeah was it cast in
[1:19:28] stone so thankful amen the prophet comes
[1:19:32] back and he says now I'm going to go
[1:19:36] back I I was trying to get away he said
[1:19:38] I'm going to go back but I can't go like
[1:19:40] I am
[1:19:41] now even though he had to go back he
[1:19:44] couldn't go like he was now he said cuz
[1:19:46] I still feel like they should have heard
[1:19:47] the message so there was still an
[1:19:50] offense there was still a hurt and he
[1:19:52] said I can't go am I can't go back the
[1:19:56] way I am now feeling this way
[1:19:58] something's got to happen to me to
[1:20:00] change
[1:20:01] me said God something's got to happen to
[1:20:04] me to change
[1:20:05] me change me
[1:20:07] God and then I I I'm Marvel at the
[1:20:11] mercies of God brother B preaching and
[1:20:14] opening his heart and he's pouring out
[1:20:16] where he's been and what he's done and
[1:20:18] where his failure was and why he wanted
[1:20:20] to take the action it was all for self
[1:20:23] he was justifying it by scripture
[1:20:25] by Bible types it was all for self comes
[1:20:29] to the end of it he he's repenting
[1:20:31] before his church he's repenting before
[1:20:32] God he's declaring it all and he's
[1:20:34] saying there's still something has to
[1:20:35] change in me I can't go that way and lo
[1:20:39] and behold at the end of service a man
[1:20:41] right in the front drops
[1:20:43] dead brother way Falls
[1:20:45] dead and brother brandham in the midst
[1:20:48] of explaining his failure where he's
[1:20:50] failed in the ministry where God
[1:20:51] corrected him where he's going to have
[1:20:53] to still have a change in his life life
[1:20:54] he's still not right he steps down and
[1:20:56] he goes and he lays hands on the brother
[1:20:58] and calls for his life back and God
[1:20:59] raises a brother from the dead oh my
[1:21:02] goodness he's in the midst of explaining
[1:21:04] I'm still not right I still need God to
[1:21:06] do something and God's still using the
[1:21:08] man because God knows and he understands
[1:21:10] and he's bringing us to a higher level
[1:21:12] God's still been using us and he's still
[1:21:14] by his own Grace by his own Mercy he's
[1:21:16] still doing something in our lives but
[1:21:18] he wants us to come to another place
[1:21:20] we're moving to the Capstone friends to
[1:21:22] perfect love
[1:21:25] to be the reflection of Jesus Christ on
[1:21:28] the
[1:21:29] earth I just when I see what God did
[1:21:32] right there at the end of service and
[1:21:34] brother B said I can't go back I can't
[1:21:35] go back I and then at the end of service
[1:21:37] he says I'm going back
[1:21:40] now I don't know how God did it I don't
[1:21:43] know how God changed his feeling in his
[1:21:44] heart but God
[1:21:48] did
[1:21:51] amen praise God let's go to Second Peter
[1:21:55] chapter
[1:22:05] 1 second Peter chapter
[1:22:15] 1 second Peter chapter 1 verse
[1:22:20] 2 said Grace and peace be multiplied in
[1:22:23] you through the knowledge of God and of
[1:22:24] Jes Jesus Christ Our
[1:22:27] Lord
[1:22:28] according as his divine power has given
[1:22:31] unto us all things that pertain into
[1:22:32] life and godliness through the knowledge
[1:22:34] of him that ha called us to glory and to
[1:22:36] Virtue whereby are given unto us
[1:22:38] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:22:40] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:22:42] the divine
[1:22:43] nature having escaped the corruption
[1:22:46] that is in the world through lust now
[1:22:49] you go on he starts talking about the
[1:22:52] the stature of a perfect man and the
[1:22:53] divine nature I'm not going to go into
[1:22:55] that but I want to take this last
[1:22:57] statement into our Focus escaping the
[1:22:59] corruption that is in the world through
[1:23:02] lust how did the corruption come into
[1:23:04] the world through
[1:23:07] lust Eve lusted she lusted for knowledge
[1:23:11] she lusted for something he he the the
[1:23:14] servant beged her and she began to Crave
[1:23:17] or desire or want something more than
[1:23:19] what God had given her and that's
[1:23:22] lust so I've explained it before but
[1:23:25] I'll explain it again many times we use
[1:23:27] commonly we use the term lust only to
[1:23:29] mean sexual lust sexual desire wrong
[1:23:32] sexual desire but but that's not what
[1:23:35] lust means in the Bible that's certainly
[1:23:37] part of it but lust means a want yes
[1:23:40] just anything you want you're lusting
[1:23:42] for right so at the at the end of church
[1:23:45] you'll be lusting for your
[1:23:48] lunch right it's normal it's it's it's a
[1:23:51] normal thing so don't when you say lust
[1:23:53] don't put it off on the something
[1:23:54] something else just realize what it is
[1:23:56] corruption entered the world through
[1:23:57] what through
[1:23:58] lust she wanted something she that self
[1:24:03] she wanted something he he began to show
[1:24:06] her that she needed another knowledge
[1:24:08] another position she needed to know she
[1:24:10] didn't know and it created a lust and
[1:24:12] when a lust came she could be
[1:24:14] manipulated she could be deceived and
[1:24:15] she could fall amen but all of that
[1:24:18] comes from self it's a
[1:24:21] want that's why I said God help us help
[1:24:24] us to get to the place where all I want
[1:24:26] is
[1:24:27] Christ I I where I you know there's
[1:24:30] nothing wrong with wanting we we we want
[1:24:32] a nice yard and and we want to take a
[1:24:34] vacation and that's all fine but make
[1:24:36] sure that all of our wants amen are way
[1:24:38] below the first one and the first one is
[1:24:41] him all I want is him I want to please
[1:24:43] him and let everything else
[1:24:46] die let everything else fall away and if
[1:24:48] anything hinders this let it fall away
[1:24:51] my job relationships let everything else
[1:24:54] I want him I don't want a lust for
[1:24:56] anything else because that's how
[1:24:58] corruption enters even
[1:25:00] us is when we begin to want we want
[1:25:03] Prestige we we want money we we want
[1:25:06] honor we want something and when we want
[1:25:09] that's where corruption gets in and
[1:25:10] that's where the devil has easy access
[1:25:12] to us and begins to manipulate us
[1:25:14] because he creates a want amen you could
[1:25:16] have this and you could have honor and
[1:25:18] you could have money and you could have
[1:25:19] this job and you can have whatever you
[1:25:21] can have and all of a sudden he offers
[1:25:23] this amen and creates in you a desire
[1:25:26] for this and then all of a sudden you
[1:25:28] have to start lacing together scriptures
[1:25:30] and quotes to justify your
[1:25:33] action and really all it has to do is
[1:25:36] his lust
[1:25:38] yes God help us die to
[1:25:42] self let's look over at second Timothy
[1:25:45] while we're here at the end of the New
[1:25:46] Testament let's jump over to Second
[1:25:53] Timothy
[1:25:55] 2 Timothy
[1:25:58] 4
[1:26:02] 1 in 2 Timothy 4:1 he says I charge thee
[1:26:05] therefore before God and and the Lord
[1:26:07] Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick
[1:26:09] and the dead it is a appearing in his
[1:26:11] kingdom preach the word be instant in
[1:26:14] season out of season reprove rebuke
[1:26:16] exhort with all longsuffering and
[1:26:17] Doctrine for the time will come when
[1:26:19] they will not endure sound Doctrine for
[1:26:22] after their own lust shall they Heap to
[1:26:24] themselves teachers having itchy ears
[1:26:27] they shall turn away their ears from the
[1:26:29] truth and shall be turned to
[1:26:32] fables you say oh those those poor
[1:26:34] people were
[1:26:36] deceived no they got exactly what they
[1:26:42] wanted
[1:26:44] amen they got exactly what they
[1:26:48] wanted let's go to acts before I comment
[1:26:50] on that let's go to acts turn to Acts
[1:26:52] chapter 20 I want to lay this scripture
[1:26:54] in
[1:26:56] too in Acts chapter 20 Paul has gathered
[1:26:59] the Elders of the churches together and
[1:27:00] he's speaking to the Brethren and he's
[1:27:02] warning them because he's soon to depart
[1:27:06] and he says in in Acts
[1:27:09] 20 and verse
[1:27:12] 28 he says take heed therefore unto
[1:27:15] yourselves and to all the flock over the
[1:27:17] which the Holy Ghost hath made you
[1:27:19] overseers to feed the Church of God
[1:27:21] which he hath purchased with his own
[1:27:22] blood for I know this that after my
[1:27:24] departing shall Grievious wolves enter
[1:27:26] in among you not sparing the flock also
[1:27:29] of your own selves who he's speaking to
[1:27:31] his Ministerial Association the ones
[1:27:34] that were partners with him in Ministry
[1:27:37] he said also of your own selves shall
[1:27:38] men arise speaking perverse things to
[1:27:41] draw away disciples after them so why
[1:27:44] did these men come bringing their own
[1:27:46] doctrines and their own teachings
[1:27:48] because they wanted to bring disciples
[1:27:49] to themselves why for their own lust but
[1:27:53] in second Timothy we find that the
[1:27:55] people were having itching ears heaping
[1:27:58] to themselves teachers so that they
[1:27:59] could have their own lust amen so so
[1:28:02] there's there's wrong on both sides but
[1:28:04] these two have a magnetism they come
[1:28:06] together we say poor deceived people
[1:28:08] maybe it was the people who were heaping
[1:28:10] to themselves teachers having itchy ears
[1:28:12] they wanted to hear something that
[1:28:13] allowed them to stay in their own lusts
[1:28:16] and then you have a Ministry amen who
[1:28:18] will speak perverse things amen because
[1:28:20] they're bringing disciples to themselves
[1:28:22] and the whole thing is corruption
[1:28:23] through love
[1:28:25] L and me it doesn't matter it doesn't
[1:28:27] matter how much you say I believe the
[1:28:29] prophet I believe the Bible I'm using
[1:28:31] the scriptures if that's the motivation
[1:28:33] behind it how do you think it's going to
[1:28:35] come out what do you think the result's
[1:28:36] going to
[1:28:39] be say God give us pure hearts on both
[1:28:43] sides remember nanism is impossible
[1:28:46] unless there's a people who want to be
[1:28:47] ruled over by the
[1:28:49] leoty we say those dirty rotten those
[1:28:52] those priests back in that day they took
[1:28:54] authority over those poor people and
[1:28:56] some of that's true some were just
[1:28:57] caught up in the mix but there had to be
[1:28:59] a majority there had to be a people that
[1:29:01] allowed it and wanted it and permitted
[1:29:03] it or it would never happen the error is
[1:29:05] on lust on both sides because people
[1:29:08] didn't want to take responsibility for
[1:29:10] their own spiritual well-being they
[1:29:11] didn't want to have to pray they didn't
[1:29:13] want to have to seek God they didn't
[1:29:15] want to have to repent what they want to
[1:29:16] do is come and be part of the system be
[1:29:18] told they're okay have some holy water
[1:29:20] sprinkled on and a guarantee they're
[1:29:21] going to
[1:29:23] heaven you know what the same thing can
[1:29:25] happen today amen I want to go to a good
[1:29:27] church with a good Ministry and there
[1:29:29] may be nothing wrong there but you're
[1:29:30] still responsible for your own
[1:29:33] soul we can never turn over our
[1:29:35] responsibility to somebody else that's
[1:29:38] the other half of
[1:29:40] nianis then you have to have a a a
[1:29:43] rulership you have to have an authority
[1:29:45] that wants to dominate wants to control
[1:29:47] for their own glory and for their own
[1:29:50] lust and those two entities come
[1:29:52] together to create nianis
[1:29:54] am and the whole thing's based on lust
[1:29:57] on
[1:30:01] self when brother Bram set up when when
[1:30:03] he said the only way up is down ah my
[1:30:07] goodness I thought that was a simple
[1:30:09] statement it's becoming the greatest
[1:30:21] truth in Philippians 1 I'm just going to
[1:30:23] read this Philippians 1:15 Paul says
[1:30:26] some indeed preach Christ even of envy
[1:30:29] and strife
[1:30:31] yes so you can preach Christ of envy and
[1:30:34] strife they did in Paul's day some
[1:30:37] indeed preach Christ even of envy and
[1:30:39] strife and some also of Goodwill the one
[1:30:41] preach Christ of contention not
[1:30:44] sincerely supposing to add Affliction to
[1:30:46] my bonds but the other of love knowing
[1:30:48] that I am set for the defense of the
[1:30:50] Gospel so one preaches for love the
[1:30:52] other preaches for Envy
[1:30:55] Strife but you know what Paul said at
[1:30:57] the end at least Christ has
[1:30:59] preached he wouldn't he wouldn't even
[1:31:02] con he wouldn't even condemn it and tell
[1:31:04] them to stop but at least Christ has
[1:31:05] preached but some are doing it for envy
[1:31:07] and
[1:31:08] strife to add afflictions to the bonds
[1:31:10] of Paul because they're jealous of him
[1:31:11] and have a hatred towards him and
[1:31:13] they're preaching a gospel a word
[1:31:16] because they don't like
[1:31:19] Paul what a poor motivation for
[1:31:21] preaching yeah God help every one of us
[1:31:26] amen but let's turn to John 15
[1:31:36] together John
[1:31:44] 15 John 15 verse
[1:31:48] 26 but when the comforter is come whom I
[1:31:51] will send unto from the father even the
[1:31:53] spirit of truth which proceedeth from
[1:31:55] the father he shall testify of
[1:31:58] me what is the spirit it's the spirit of
[1:32:02] Truth and what will the spirit of Truth
[1:32:05] do he will testify of Christ
[1:32:11] amen not the spirit of Truth is not
[1:32:15] coming into a man to draw disciples into
[1:32:17] himself to feed his pride to promote
[1:32:21] even his Lust For filthy lucer that's
[1:32:24] not what the Holy Ghost comes
[1:32:26] for but when he comes he he shall lead
[1:32:29] you into all truth and he will testify
[1:32:32] of me
[1:32:35] amen
[1:32:36] my what are we supposed to be doing I
[1:32:40] think we're supposed to be presenting
[1:32:41] the word with
[1:32:42] love for souls for
[1:32:45] salvation preaching for the edification
[1:32:47] unto Faith till we all come into the
[1:32:50] stature of a perfect man to the unity of
[1:32:52] Faith to the headship of of Christ to
[1:32:55] the very likeness of Christ to the end
[1:32:56] of the Commandment is love out of a pure
[1:32:58] heart and a good conscience and Faith
[1:33:01] unfeigned till we keep our goal our
[1:33:03] Target in mind what's our
[1:33:05] Target the
[1:33:08] Capstone
[1:33:10] love even in teaching our children there
[1:33:13] so many times that we inject our own
[1:33:15] pride in our teaching to our children
[1:33:18] and we instruct them in the ways of the
[1:33:20] the word because we want to keep them
[1:33:22] looking good for our image amongst the
[1:33:26] Brethren and the it's not wrong what we
[1:33:29] taught them because what we taught them
[1:33:30] is the word what was wrong was the
[1:33:32] spirit behind it was my
[1:33:34] pride I didn't want to lose face in
[1:33:37] front of my brothers and sisters so I
[1:33:39] attached my pride to this beautiful
[1:33:42] word and when I put that on my children
[1:33:45] you know many times our children haven't
[1:33:46] resisted the word they've resisted the
[1:33:48] underlying
[1:33:51] Pride because they're sensing something
[1:33:54] this not right because it's not about my
[1:33:56] soul this is not about love this is not
[1:33:58] about you loving me and caring about my
[1:34:00] soul and wanting me to grow in
[1:34:01] righteousness this is about you wanting
[1:34:03] me not to embarrass
[1:34:07] you and what's happened is we're not
[1:34:09] speaking the truth in
[1:34:10] love we're speaking it in Pride
[1:34:15] yes we want we want to stay our image
[1:34:18] intact that's
[1:34:20] Pride we want to hold ourselves in a
[1:34:22] certain way in front of other people and
[1:34:24] that's not speaking the word in love and
[1:34:27] there's nothing wrong with keeping a
[1:34:28] standard in your home and tell the
[1:34:29] people this is my home and this is what
[1:34:30] I believe and this is the way it's going
[1:34:32] to be here because I'm honoring God and
[1:34:33] I believe the
[1:34:34] word but just as soon as Pride's
[1:34:37] attached to that that th those senses of
[1:34:40] those kids are going to start catching
[1:34:41] there's something else motivating this
[1:34:43] and many times they have not run away
[1:34:45] from the word or the message they've run
[1:34:46] away from pride and envy and strife and
[1:34:50] they've gotten away from those things
[1:34:51] that are wicked and evil not from the
[1:34:53] right of the
[1:34:55] word so God help us to be pure in our
[1:34:59] hearts and pure with this word and I
[1:35:02] want to be right in my
[1:35:06] heart that's why brother B said I would
[1:35:08] rather be wrong in my Doctrine and right
[1:35:09] in my
[1:35:11] heart instead of wrong in my heart and
[1:35:13] right in my Doctrine because if I'm
[1:35:15] wrong in my heart and right in my
[1:35:16] Doctrine I'll take a right Doctrine with
[1:35:17] a wrong heart and I'll use it for
[1:35:19] manipulation and control for my own
[1:35:21] pride and my own envy and for my own
[1:35:23] purpose says and I will actually take
[1:35:25] the Glorious word of God and Destroy
[1:35:26] lives because of what's wrong inside of
[1:35:31] me and that's not why God sent the
[1:35:36] word let's turn to Psalms 33 if we could
[1:35:51] together Psalms 33: vers
[1:36:00] 4 the scripture means so much to me now
[1:36:04] for the word of the Lord is right and
[1:36:06] all his works are done in
[1:36:11] truth the word of the Lord is right and
[1:36:13] all his works are done in truth God
[1:36:15] never did anything for vain glory for
[1:36:19] Pride for Envy for Strife for
[1:36:22] hatred his word is right and all of his
[1:36:25] works are truth what do you think our
[1:36:27] work should look like our work should be
[1:36:29] done in
[1:36:31] truth Jesus he looked at the Pharisees
[1:36:34] and he said you're whiteed seers you're
[1:36:37] all polished and clean on the outside
[1:36:38] but inside you're full of dead men's
[1:36:41] bones you you broaden your floras you
[1:36:43] give great swelling words of praise you
[1:36:45] blow a trumpet and you put money in
[1:36:47] you're doing all of that for
[1:36:49] pride and Jesus could look Beyond it and
[1:36:52] said with the condition really
[1:36:55] was but all his works are done in
[1:36:59] truth when that little widow woman
[1:37:02] didn't blow a trumpet she didn't make a
[1:37:03] sign she just slipped over and dropped
[1:37:05] all she had into the treasury her Works
[1:37:08] were
[1:37:10] truth the Pharisees works when he blew
[1:37:12] the trumpet so everybody would watch him
[1:37:14] drop in his bag of money his Works were
[1:37:20] evil they did the same thing brother
[1:37:22] Chad they put money in the Treasure
[1:37:24] y same work one was done in truth one
[1:37:28] was a pretense it was hypocrisy so the
[1:37:30] work was a
[1:37:32] lie because the work was saying I do
[1:37:34] this because I love God and actually I'm
[1:37:36] doing this because I want the people to
[1:37:38] love
[1:37:39] me
[1:37:46] amen I stand on the street corner and
[1:37:49] give great swelling words and pray loud
[1:37:52] prayers brother B said to be seen of
[1:37:56] men that work is not a work in truth
[1:38:00] that is deception on display that's a
[1:38:03] lie because you're showing the world
[1:38:05] that you love God and you're singing
[1:38:07] praises to God and really what's
[1:38:09] happening is you love yourself and you
[1:38:10] want people to admire you right amen but
[1:38:14] God's word is right and his works are in
[1:38:18] truth God help me I want my Works to be
[1:38:20] in
[1:38:22] truth
[1:38:24] it's all I can say is God help me that's
[1:38:26] what I keep saying the further I go the
[1:38:27] more I say God help
[1:38:29] me you remember the story of we talked
[1:38:32] about this a few weeks ago but remember
[1:38:34] the story of the the woman caught in
[1:38:36] adultery and they brought her to Jesus
[1:38:39] and they're saying Moses says in the law
[1:38:40] this woman she's caught in the very Act
[1:38:41] of adultery she should be stoned what do
[1:38:43] you say and he said they did this
[1:38:45] tempting
[1:38:46] him you know how deplorable this is yeah
[1:38:51] they have no desire to keep the word
[1:38:56] right their whole motivation is not
[1:38:59] works and
[1:39:00] Truth the whole motivation is tempting
[1:39:03] him so they have reason to find fault
[1:39:07] yes the whole thing's a setup because if
[1:39:10] they wanted to keep the camp clean they
[1:39:12] would have brought the man she committed
[1:39:13] adultery with because they said she was
[1:39:16] caught in the very act how are you
[1:39:17] caught in the very Act of adultery if
[1:39:18] there's no
[1:39:20] man the Bible say she's caught in the
[1:39:22] very Act and so there was a man present
[1:39:25] and and their their whole action proves
[1:39:27] their motive their motive is not pure
[1:39:29] this is not a work in truth because if
[1:39:30] they were doing this according to Moses
[1:39:32] to keep sin out of the camp to keep the
[1:39:34] camp clean they would have brought the
[1:39:35] man to this had nothing to do with the
[1:39:37] truth of the word it had everything to
[1:39:39] do with their envy and jealousy and
[1:39:40] hatred towards Jesus and now they're
[1:39:42] manipulating the word to try to set a
[1:39:44] trap for the
[1:39:46] word how Wicked to use God's glorious
[1:39:50] word in such an evil
[1:39:51] way to just justify self to justify your
[1:39:55] reason for condemning a man for hating
[1:39:57] him all because you can tie together
[1:39:59] something and you can lay a trap and you
[1:40:01] can make him say the wrong thing so that
[1:40:02] you can test to everybody he's a false
[1:40:04] minister or a false brother cuz he
[1:40:05] didn't believe
[1:40:06] this maybe he just sens that the whole
[1:40:09] thing was a big setup anyways and you
[1:40:10] weren't even honest in your
[1:40:16] question Jesus I'm so thankful he didn't
[1:40:19] take the
[1:40:22] bait found a way to keep the word and to
[1:40:26] let the woman go and it's not that he
[1:40:28] didn't know she was guilty she was
[1:40:29] guilty was she worthy of death according
[1:40:32] to law she was worthy of death according
[1:40:33] to the law but that woman was part of a
[1:40:35] manipulation
[1:40:37] scheme and Jesus knew it y she was
[1:40:41] guilty yes she was guilty but she was
[1:40:43] being used for another purpose and the
[1:40:46] Lord discerned it and in his in his
[1:40:48] great wisdom he let the woman go free
[1:40:51] because this isn't about righteousness
[1:40:53] this isn't about keeping the law this
[1:40:55] isn't about purity this is pure simple
[1:41:03] jealousy let's not take the message and
[1:41:06] attach it to
[1:41:08] jealousy Envy
[1:41:12] hatred let's be motivated by
[1:41:16] love same reason he sent it he sent the
[1:41:20] message to call his bride to himself
[1:41:22] because he loved her
[1:41:24] he sent the message for grace and mercy
[1:41:26] and love that's why he sent it if it's
[1:41:29] rejected will it bring judgment sure it
[1:41:31] will but that's not why he sent
[1:41:34] it let's come with the same motive
[1:41:37] behind it
[1:41:39] all remember when Judas this story takes
[1:41:43] place in John chapter 12 when Judas sees
[1:41:47] Mary break the alabaster box of ointment
[1:41:49] anoint Jesus's head and his feet and
[1:41:52] Judas says
[1:41:54] what a
[1:41:55] waste says and listen what he says this
[1:41:59] money should have been sold this should
[1:42:01] have been sold in the money given to the
[1:42:05] poor Judas you know what you're a good
[1:42:09] guy thinking of the poor and loving the
[1:42:11] poor and worried about the poor and the
[1:42:14] Bible said he said that not that he
[1:42:16] cared for the poor but because he was a
[1:42:20] thief and he carried the money back
[1:42:25] he covered he covered his greed with
[1:42:32] piety but what was behind it was
[1:42:36] greed but what was on the outside was
[1:42:39] piety and godliness and care for others
[1:42:43] Aiden didn't care one drop about the
[1:42:45] poor all he cared about was getting the
[1:42:47] money in the bag CU he carried what was
[1:42:48] there and he lifted it out of there for
[1:42:50] himself CU he was a thief
[1:42:55] doesn't matter what we
[1:42:57] say what matters is what we are in our
[1:43:00] hearts we can make a pile of mistakes
[1:43:04] that's not even what's important what's
[1:43:05] important is what's our
[1:43:07] motivation what are we trying to do what
[1:43:09] what are we moving in love are we trying
[1:43:12] are we trying to represent Christ on
[1:43:14] this Earth and you can make a pile of
[1:43:15] mistakes and it still be right that's
[1:43:17] right but you can have the wrong
[1:43:18] motivation and make no mistake lace the
[1:43:20] message together so perfectly quote it
[1:43:22] just exactly have the scriptures just
[1:43:24] right and never be off in the word at
[1:43:25] all dress just right act just right go
[1:43:28] to church every time pay the tithes and
[1:43:29] do the offering but it can never cover
[1:43:32] for a corrupted
[1:43:36] heart the heart has to be right and all
[1:43:39] of those works are right and all of
[1:43:41] those works are the word but let's do
[1:43:42] the works in truth like God does his
[1:43:45] works all of his works are truth let all
[1:43:47] of my Works be
[1:43:49] truth no more
[1:43:52] pretense when we're
[1:43:54] faking brother bam said and Satan
[1:43:58] zeden makes a statement he said I heard
[1:44:00] brother Neville say this morning someone
[1:44:02] might have been asking him why didn't I
[1:44:04] preach on the Holy Ghost why didn't I do
[1:44:06] this said here it is the Holy Ghost is
[1:44:09] the action in you amen it's a life not
[1:44:13] an emotion not some sort of a fleshly
[1:44:15] evidence but it's a person Jesus Christ
[1:44:18] the word of God established in your
[1:44:20] heart to Quicken every word of the age
[1:44:23] watch the Holy Ghost In Action not so
[1:44:26] much in demonstration but in action what
[1:44:29] it does according to the
[1:44:31] word the Holy Ghost is the life to do
[1:44:35] what to keep the
[1:44:37] word watch it in action he
[1:44:45] said remember brother bam told
[1:44:48] us that this bride will be the final
[1:44:51] voice and the final age she's
[1:44:54] predestinated to be the final voice in
[1:44:56] the final age but he says she under her
[1:45:00] Messenger will be the final voice to the
[1:45:03] final age under her messenger staying
[1:45:06] subject to the message we be subject to
[1:45:08] the
[1:45:09] word not having her
[1:45:12] own that's right remember after she eats
[1:45:14] the book in Revelation 10 she us to
[1:45:16] prophesy again that prophesy again means
[1:45:18] a repeating not her own
[1:45:21] prophecies not her own interpretation
[1:45:24] not her own Revelation but she's to
[1:45:26] prophesy again that's what's already
[1:45:28] been
[1:45:29] prophesied we're here to preach the
[1:45:31] message not our own
[1:45:33] ideas we're not here to build our own
[1:45:35] platform we're not here to glorify
[1:45:37] ourselves we're here to glorify
[1:45:39] Christ we're not here to present
[1:45:40] ourselves to the people we're here to
[1:45:41] present Christ to the
[1:45:43] people it's going to take a pure
[1:45:45] heart brother B says she'll be the final
[1:45:49] voice to the final
[1:45:51] age but in Revelation CH 4 he makes this
[1:45:55] statement he says now everybody can't be
[1:45:58] a preacher but you got a voice and if
[1:46:01] you can't preach the people a sermon if
[1:46:03] you're a preacher you called to the
[1:46:04] pulpit to preach if you're not you're
[1:46:06] still a preacher but live the people a
[1:46:08] sermon let your sermon be lived and it's
[1:46:11] the voice of God that will bring
[1:46:12] reproach to them who reject him no one
[1:46:14] can put a finger on his or her life
[1:46:16] they're sweet loving if there ever was a
[1:46:18] man of God is that man or that woman see
[1:46:20] live your sermon and brother B says
[1:46:23] that's the Thunder that shakes the devil
[1:46:25] he don't care how loud you shout and how
[1:46:27] much you jumping down but when he sees
[1:46:29] that
[1:46:30] life that our life is testifying of
[1:46:33] Christ Our Life that we live our
[1:46:35] subjection to him our works that are
[1:46:37] done in truth amen and then when the
[1:46:39] words match our life and our life match
[1:46:41] the words and there's a unity and a
[1:46:43] Harmony between what's in our heart and
[1:46:44] what our motive is between what we say
[1:46:47] Amen that brings life am that will bring
[1:46:50] life it has life in it and it's come
[1:46:52] through the right channel the right way
[1:46:54] anointed by the Holy Ghost let's go to
[1:46:57] Galatians 5 I want to read just I think
[1:46:59] just one or just two more
[1:47:01] scriptures Galatians chapter
[1:47:09] 5 Galatians chapter
[1:47:12] 5 and verse
[1:47:18] 22 522 he says but the fruit of the
[1:47:21] spirit is love joy peace longsuffering
[1:47:26] gentleness goodness Faith meekness
[1:47:31] Temperance against such there is no
[1:47:35] law you can't even write a law against
[1:47:38] it because this is all the purpose of
[1:47:42] the law was to bring man to this kind of
[1:47:46] Life they asked Jesus what's the
[1:47:48] greatest
[1:47:48] commandment he said love the Lord thy
[1:47:50] God with all thy heart with all thy
[1:47:52] strength with all thy mind with all thy
[1:47:53] Soul that's the greatest commandment
[1:47:55] amen he said and the second is like unto
[1:47:57] the first love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:48:01] he said on these two Commandments hang
[1:48:03] all the law and the
[1:48:05] prophets the whole Bible was wrapped up
[1:48:08] in what you trying to give your whole
[1:48:10] life to God and give him preeminence and
[1:48:13] you live your life to others the way he
[1:48:16] would that was the purpose of the whole
[1:48:18] Bible the whole law on the prophets was
[1:48:20] trying to get a people who would
[1:48:22] surrender completely to God and operate
[1:48:24] towards other people the same way God
[1:48:26] would operate towards other people that
[1:48:27] was the whole purpose of the law so what
[1:48:30] is the end of the Commandment love out
[1:48:32] of a pure heart and a good conscience
[1:48:34] and Faith unfeigned what is the goal in
[1:48:37] this day the stature of a perfect man
[1:48:39] what is it it's climbing up through
[1:48:41] faith meekness Temperance kindness
[1:48:42] brotherly love all the way to God
[1:48:45] himself God love the Capstone capping
[1:48:48] off our lives Vulcanizing it all
[1:48:50] together and displaying the life of
[1:48:52] Jesus Christ
[1:48:53] that's the end
[1:48:55] game God purify my heart purify my
[1:49:01] heart
[1:49:04] amen praise
[1:49:06] God I'm going to read this last
[1:49:08] scripture 2 Corinthians while we turn
[1:49:11] here maybe the musicians would like to
[1:49:13] come brother Blake would like to come
[1:49:16] second Corinthians chapter
[1:49:21] 3
[1:49:26] 2 Corinthians chapter 3 verse
[1:49:31] 3 says for as much as ye are manifestly
[1:49:34] decare declared to be the Epistle of
[1:49:37] Christ ministered by US Written not with
[1:49:41] ink but with the spirit of the Living
[1:49:44] God not in tables of stone but in the
[1:49:47] fleshly tables of the heart
[1:49:51] amen the final voice to the final age
[1:49:56] that's what this
[1:49:57] is the final voice to the final age the
[1:50:01] Epistle of Christ when you read through
[1:50:04] the Epistles you have the Epistle of
[1:50:06] Paul to the Corinthians the Epistle of
[1:50:08] Paul to the Thessalonians the Epistle of
[1:50:10] Peter the Epistle of John the Epistle of
[1:50:13] James you have all kinds of Epistles
[1:50:15] which just means letters it's a letter
[1:50:17] that is a letter that Paul wrote to the
[1:50:19] Corinthians it was a letter that Peter
[1:50:21] wrote to the church but he says you're
[1:50:25] Christ's letter to the
[1:50:28] world you're his letter not written with
[1:50:32] ink and not chiseled in stone you're a
[1:50:35] living letter and it's engraved in your
[1:50:38] heart oh praise God let's become
[1:50:42] this for as much as you are manifestly
[1:50:45] declared to be the Epistle of Christ
[1:50:48] ministered by US Written not with ink
[1:50:51] but with the spirit of the Living God
[1:50:54] not by might not by power not by Church
[1:50:57] orders not by a super anointed preacher
[1:51:00] not by human effort not by rules and
[1:51:02] regulations but by my spirit sayeth the
[1:51:05] Lord the only way to get this right is
[1:51:08] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:51:10] indwelling of God his very life the very
[1:51:13] one that anointed the writing of the
[1:51:15] word the very one that was alive in
[1:51:17] Jesus Christ the very life that's in the
[1:51:19] church now to manifest the word and keep
[1:51:22] it
[1:51:23] pure the fruits of the spirit are these
[1:51:26] meekness Joy Temperance Faith against
[1:51:28] such there is no law the never the law
[1:51:30] was never written against the spirit the
[1:51:31] law was always written against our
[1:51:33] nature amen but the spirit is supposed
[1:51:36] to work us against our nature back into
[1:51:39] the word of
[1:51:42] God not written with ink but with the
[1:51:44] spirit of the Living God not in tables
[1:51:47] of stone but in the fleshly tables of
[1:51:51] the heart amen say
[1:51:55] God write your word in my heart amen
[1:51:59] make me that epistle that Living Word I
[1:52:04] can't make
[1:52:05] myself what I can do is recognize that I
[1:52:08] need God and I can
[1:52:09] Surrender by the grace of God he's given
[1:52:12] me something that can recognize under
[1:52:14] the preaching of the word that I need
[1:52:15] more of him that I'm not where I ought
[1:52:17] to be and that I need him to come and
[1:52:20] wash me out and burn me out and I need
[1:52:22] him him to take over but that's Grace
[1:52:24] that allows us to come to that
[1:52:26] recognition and all I can do is say I
[1:52:29] surrender all all I can do is say it's
[1:52:32] me Lord but I'm here and I believe that
[1:52:37] you called me for this purpose and I
[1:52:38] want to be surrendered to this purpose

[1:53:02] another move of God although it was a
[1:53:05] move of God it was more than that it was
[1:53:09] Christ coming to manifest himself in
[1:53:13] flesh so much more than another Revival
[1:53:17] so much more than another move so much
[1:53:19] more than another exciting set of
[1:53:21] circumstances that come to the church
[1:53:23] it's more than that friends It's the
[1:53:25] Return of the fullness of Christ into
[1:53:27] his people amen so that he can finish
[1:53:31] the work that he left to do in and
[1:53:32] through the bride in this
[1:53:34] day oh we just have to surrender to him
[1:53:37] friends we have to recognize that we
[1:53:40] need him how do you surrender when you
[1:53:41] don't know you need to

[1:53:45] and I've got this wrapped up and I've
[1:53:46] got it all under how do you know that
[1:53:48] there's still more need for
[1:53:51] surrender oh God I hope he opens our
