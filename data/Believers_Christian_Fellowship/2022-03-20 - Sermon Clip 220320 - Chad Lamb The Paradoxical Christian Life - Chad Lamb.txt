TRANSCRIPT
========================================
brother ben said as long as you're you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you you're born again so i can be born again on the inside by the new birth by the baptism holy ghost and on the outside i can still be troubled by an old carnal nature about that old sticky cockleburn nature on the outside that's what the prophet of god taught us and that's his explanation of romans chapter 7. so that we would not be deceived by the devil amen so that we would understand god has so made it clear to us that we won't trip over our own feet but when we begin to stumble around in the outer man we say wait a minute that's not who i am that's not me amen that's what this is the package that i came in in this line amen but me is the me down on the inside and me on the inside doesn't like that doesn't want that amen the me on the inside wants only the word of god believes god amen doesn't doubt god doesn't question his word has peace has love has joy has long suffering has all of these things so that you can become a paradox where on the outside you can have sorrow perplexity confusion distress even down but on the inside you can have a solid rock of faith and peace and joy that never passes away so that you become a paradox that this christian life is a paradox where you can have two opposing emotions going on inside of you at the exact same time where you can be weeping but you know everything's all right you can be afraid but you know you're safe if that's not true then who are we amen what are we you can you can i mean when when you get a call or you see an accident and you see one of your children fall off of something or in a terrible kind of accident amen you cannot stop the outside reaction there can be fear there can be perplexity anxiety stress and all of these things but there's something else down on the inside that knows it's going to be okay there's a faith that doesn't go away it's there
