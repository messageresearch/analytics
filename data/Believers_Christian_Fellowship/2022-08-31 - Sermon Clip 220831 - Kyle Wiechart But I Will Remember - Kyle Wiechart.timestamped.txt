[0:00] david in his mind goes back to the the
[0:02] stories of old and he goes back to moses
[0:05] and here's god with a mighty
[0:06] outstretched hand delivering the
[0:08] children of israel from the egyptians
[0:10] he's taking them he's bringing down
[0:11] flies he's bringing in frogs he's
[0:13] bringing in darkness he's he's sending
[0:15] the death angel land god is mightily on
[0:18] the move to set his children free and in
[0:20] the process of them coming free he
[0:22] brings them right up to a red sea
[0:25] this is a shocking thing and all of
[0:28] david wandering he gets encouraged and
[0:30] he remembers oh god you haven't forsaken
[0:33] me oh god you never forsake your people
[0:35] many times you just lead us to the red
[0:37] sea and we can't see your footsteps
[0:39] anymore where did you go i don't know
[0:41] where you went lord but you promised
[0:42] you'd be with me and this encouraged
[0:44] david and his inspiration struck him and
[0:47] said you didn't leave me lord you just
[0:48] brought me to a red sea and i just don't
[0:50] know where you're at
[0:52] but he knew the footsteps were going
[0:54] right through that red sea
[0:56] he didn't couldn't see him anymore but
[0:58] david had a confidence and he remembered
[1:00] the lord
[1:01] and when he remembered the lord he was
[1:03] encouraged and the recognition that god
[1:05] never forsakes his people he just takes
[1:08] you to a point in time he likes to test
[1:09] you a little bit see what kind of stand
[1:11] you're going to take take you to a point
[1:13] you don't know where you're going you
[1:14] don't know if he's forgotten about you
[1:15] you don't know if he's just totally done
[1:17] with you
[1:18] and then just to see what you will do
[1:20] god likes to do these things he likes to
[1:23] bring us into situations where it looks
[1:25] like god do you want to destroy me
[1:28] i mean you have to think what were the
[1:29] hebrew children saying thank you lord
[1:31] you brought me from here by here
[1:32] wonderful look at all that and then uh
[1:33] oh red sea
[1:35] lord
[1:36] did you did you forsake me lord have you
[1:39] forgotten about me
[1:41] no
[1:42] if they could have only recognized that
[1:44] red sea was going to be their
[1:46] deliverance and the destruction of their
[1:48] enemy
[1:49] see what the devil intends for evil god
[1:51] always uses it for good and what they
[1:54] did not recognize that the difficulties
[1:56] and they couldn't understand and the
[1:58] trials that was right before them was
[2:00] only the thing that was setting up to
[2:01] bring the deliverance that they had to
[2:03] have and was going to be in the
[2:04] destruction permanently they would never
[2:06] see their enemy again
[2:08] and this has consistently and always
[2:10] been the pathway of the believer
[2:12] you're he's there with you one day and
[2:14] you know he's walking with you and you
[2:15] can see him you can feel him you know
[2:17] he's walking it's like lord it's like oh
[2:19] wow you're with me everywhere i go in
[2:21] every decision and then before long
[2:22] you're just wonderful it's fantastic and
[2:24] then lord where did you go
[2:26] did you lead me into a trap
[2:28] did you lead me into something you want
[2:29] me to be destroyed
[2:31] no
[2:33] see this was the question david had
[2:35] david was really curious but the spirit
[2:38] of the lord came upon him inspiration
[2:40] struck me said no i remember
[2:42] i've seen this before
[2:44] i know how you deal with your children i
[2:47] know exactly now what you are doing
[2:50] you've not led me to destruction
[2:52] you're bringing my deliverance
