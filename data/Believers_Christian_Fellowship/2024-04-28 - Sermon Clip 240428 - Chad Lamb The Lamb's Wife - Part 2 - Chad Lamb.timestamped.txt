[0:00] brother manam says here some time ago a
[0:03] man met me out here aside I had a
[0:06] Pianist here had a little uh had a
[0:08] little short little skirt and wasn't
[0:10] just exactly I guess just right and the
[0:13] lady had short hair and she was just a
[0:15] babe in this way and she was playing the
[0:17] piano and a man met me out there just
[0:20] tearing me to Pieces said and you're a
[0:22] Pentecostal preacher and let that woman
[0:24] sit up there with short hair and just
[0:25] going on like that everything well I
[0:27] said I think the woman has a good spirit
[0:29] in her I certainly do not agree with
[0:31] that you know I don't agree and he says
[0:35] and I think that any woman now he comes
[0:38] down a little bit later in the quote I
[0:40] think that any woman that's motherly and
[0:41] godly and a sisterly ought to go to such
[0:44] a person and with sweetness of the
[0:46] spirit just sit down and talk to that
[0:48] lady and if she's of God the holy spirit
[0:50] will understand those things and she'll
[0:52] correct herself but when you really
[0:54] quickly condemn her and drive her away
[0:56] you might harm that Young born baby see
[0:59] I wouldn't condemn the
[1:02] person so there brother brandham was
[1:05] even allowing a Woman Who Wasn't dressed
[1:07] right with short hair playing the piano
[1:09] somebody condemned him but he says but
[1:11] she's got a good spirit she's just a
[1:12] babye in the way and I wouldn't condemn
[1:14] her or harm her and then he talks to the
[1:16] man whose wife was playing the piano
[1:18] with makeup and jewelry yeah and he says
[1:20] she's a ha
[1:23] yeah you see the circumstances are
[1:25] totally
[1:27] different and the response is dictated
[1:30] by the circumstances and by the
[1:31] leadership of the Holy Ghost brother
[1:33] bandam didn't want to discourage that
[1:34] newborn babe he wanted her to learn he
[1:36] wanted her to be right but he didn't
[1:37] want to discourage her when the other
[1:40] one was the a minister's wife who had
[1:42] been who knows how long in the church
[1:44] should have known
[1:46] better to everything there is a season
[1:48] and a time a time to speak and a time to
[1:51] refrain from
[1:53] speaking so you just go and figure out
[1:56] when to speak and when to
[1:58] refrain and you let me know how it
[2:01] goes you tell me when to answer a fool
[2:04] according to his folly and then tell me
[2:06] when not to answer a fool according to
[2:08] his
[2:10] father you know what's shameful some of
[2:13] you are in the room right now trying to
[2:14] figure the answer to that question
[2:16] thinking well in this circumstance or
[2:19] give it up just quit just
[2:23] stop and recognize this isn't an
[2:25] intellectual exercise this isn't your
[2:28] experience this is the leadership of the
[2:31] Holy Ghost memorizing scriptures won't
[2:33] solve this problem it's going to take
[2:35] the spirit of God directing our mouths
[2:37] directing our mind moving Us by his
[2:40] Spirit that's the only thing that's
[2:42] going to
[2:45] work brother Bram said in the paman
[2:47] church age said those in the bride do
[2:50] only his
[2:52] will no one can make them do otherwise
[2:55] they have thus sayith the Lord or they
[2:57] keep still they know that it has to be
[2:59] God in them him doing the works
[3:00] fulfilling his own word he did not
[3:02] complete all his work while in his
[3:04] Earthly Ministry so now he works in and
[3:06] through the bride she knows that for it
[3:09] was not yet time for him to do certain
[3:11] things that he must now do but he will
[3:13] now fulfill through the bride that work
[3:16] which he left for this specific time
[3:18] amen so is God going to work in and
[3:21] through the bride absolutely how's that
[3:23] going to happen she will do only his
[3:25] will
