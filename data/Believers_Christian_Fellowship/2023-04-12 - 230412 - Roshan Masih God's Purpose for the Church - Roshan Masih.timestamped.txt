[17:21] are going on
[17:23] and we are looking for that last seed
[17:26] and then we are going
[17:29] so we all are waiting for that great
[17:32] event amen which is already
[17:36] started in our lives
[17:38] amen because we are the rapture
[17:43] Matthew 16 17 and 18 and Jesus answered
[17:48] and said unto him
[17:50] blessed art thou Simon barjona
[17:55] for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it
[17:58] unto thee but by Father which is in
[18:02] heaven and I see also unto thee that
[18:07] the word Peter and Upon This Rock I will
[18:12] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[18:15] shall not Prevail against it
[18:19] another scripture
[18:23] is found in Ephesians chapter 1 3 to 10.
[18:28] Ephesians chapter 1 3 to 10 blessed be
[18:32] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[18:34] Christ who hath blessed us with all
[18:38] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[18:41] in Christ
[18:43] accordingly according as he had chosen
[18:47] Us in him before the foundation of the
[18:49] world that we should be holy and Without
[18:52] Blame before him in love having
[18:55] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[18:59] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[19:01] according to the good pleasure of his
[19:04] will
[19:05] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[19:09] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[19:12] Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[19:16] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[19:18] sins according to the riches of his
[19:21] grace wherein he had abundant toward us
[19:26] in all wisdom and Prudence having made
[19:30] known unto us the mystery of his will
[19:33] according to his good pleasure which he
[19:36] had purposed in himself that in the
[19:40] dispensation of the fullness of times
[19:43] he might gather together in one all
[19:46] things in Christ both which are in
[19:49] heaven and which are on earth even in
[19:53] him
[19:54] amen may the Lord add His blessings upon
[19:57] the reading of his word you may be
[20:00] seated please
[20:07] a man
[20:09] so I would like to speak
[20:12] about the church last Sunday we spoke
[20:16] about the church how the church came out
[20:19] and the church has
[20:22] uh born came out
[20:25] from Christ Jesus
[20:27] which is not of Christ cannot be his
[20:31] church amen so tonight I would like to
[20:34] speak on God's purpose for the church
[20:38] amen
[20:41] and when we read
[20:43] Ephesians
[20:44] and Colossians these two books
[20:48] are wheels
[20:52] Eternal plan of God
[20:54] aboard the church amen
[20:58] the book to the Ephesians is the
[21:01] revelation of the body
[21:03] and the book of Colossians is the
[21:06] revelation of the head when we
[21:10] put these two books together
[21:14] amen then we see Christ The Head and the
[21:20] church the body amen so in Ephesians 1
[21:25] 10 and 3 9. so the Bible says this
[21:30] pension
[21:32] and fellowship the word it are used here
[21:35] when the differentiation of times the
[21:38] fullness of time comes amen then he will
[21:42] gather
[21:43] all things in Christ Jesus
[21:47] amen
[21:49] and
[21:51] I was searching the word
[21:56] dispensation
[21:58] and it
[22:01] dispensation is
[22:04] amen
[22:06] I have written here it means
[22:11] Minister things to different people
[22:17] dispensation it dispense
[22:21] distribute
[22:22] to give
[22:24] a man
[22:25] according to Webster the me dispensation
[22:29] meaning is dispense give two different
[22:33] kind of people
[22:35] this Punctuation is rightly dividing the
[22:40] word
[22:41] amen
[22:43] rightly dividing the word for the right
[22:45] group of people for their season
[22:50] how we can rightly divide
[22:53] amen when we give the word to the people
[22:56] according to the season because there is
[22:59] a word
[23:00] amen for the season and we have received
[23:04] our word which is the food for the due
[23:07] season amen so this Punctuation is
[23:11] dispense
[23:14] dispensing
[23:15] give out
[23:17] distribute
[23:19] amen
[23:20] so dispensation we have we know that
[23:24] there are seven
[23:25] dispensations of time amen
[23:29] so we see that Ephesians 1 10 and 3 9
[23:35] is talking about the dispensation
[23:39] amen
[23:40] dispensation
[23:42] also mean
[23:46] arrangement
[23:48] arrangement
[23:51] and
[23:52] appointment
[23:55] and
[23:57] divinely appointed order
[24:02] amen
[24:04] divinely appointed order
[24:08] arrangement
[24:10] amen if
[24:12] God want to dispute distribute dispense
[24:16] something
[24:17] so there should be an order
[24:20] to dispense
[24:22] there should be an arrangement
[24:25] Amen to to distribute
[24:29] or rightly divide the word so we praise
[24:33] God that we have received the word
[24:37] according to our season
[24:39] so that's is rightly dividing
[24:43] our portion in our time amen that's why
[24:47] we know what God is doing right now
[24:51] what God is going to do in the future we
[24:55] know
[24:56] our scripture our professes amen so
[25:00] Ephesians 3 9 says and to make all men
[25:05] see what is the Fellowship of the
[25:09] mystery which from the beginning of the
[25:12] word hath been hid in God
[25:16] who created All Things by Jesus Christ
[25:20] amen
[25:22] so the word Fellowship
[25:26] is like economy of God
[25:30] like this also is like arrangement of
[25:33] God plan of God the both words amen it
[25:37] means dispensation it means Arrangement
[25:41] amen so God has
[25:45] something to dispense
[25:49] amen and
[25:52] he needs an arrangement and the
[25:55] administration in order to carry out
[25:59] this dispensing
[26:03] the very substance that God is going to
[26:06] dispense is himself
[26:10] yes God wants to dispense himself to the
[26:14] people
[26:16] Adam dispense himself
[26:19] that's how his bride came
[26:22] so God wanted to dispense
[26:25] himself to the people so God is going to
[26:29] dispense himself into man
[26:33] so he arranged and and administrated the
[26:37] church
[26:39] we have a great responsibility
[26:42] we are an administration of God to
[26:47] dispense the word
[26:49] to the right kind of people
[26:52] the word amen rightly dividing according
[26:57] to right kind of people right kind of
[26:59] word
[27:01] according to their season so the church
[27:04] is the central matter in God's economy
[27:11] and judge you
[27:13] in human term is God's business
[27:18] it's God's work
[27:20] Jesus said I am a man in my father's
[27:24] business
[27:25] so churches God's business the church is
[27:29] not just a group of Fallen people come
[27:32] together and now they are saved
[27:36] yeah we are Fallen we are saved but
[27:40] the church the meaning of the church is
[27:43] much deeper than this
[27:47] because the church is called out people
[27:49] for God's purpose
[27:52] and why God wants to dispense and carry
[27:55] out his plan
[27:57] through the church
[27:58] the Heavenly and eternal view of the
[28:02] church is much higher than
[28:05] just a group of people or or for fallen
[28:10] people who are saved by grace church is
[28:13] the very Central matter of God's economy
[28:17] in God's Administration Amen in God's
[28:21] dispensation in God's arrangement in
[28:25] God's governmental stewardship he has
[28:29] eternally planned the church
[28:32] in Ephesians 3 11 says according to the
[28:37] Eternal purpose
[28:39] 311 Ephesians
[28:41] which shows that the church is not an
[28:44] accident
[28:47] church was in God's thought
[28:51] in The Eternity past
[28:54] as I
[28:56] was talking last Sunday that church did
[28:59] not come accidentally
[29:02] but that it was planned by God in
[29:05] eternity
[29:06] the church is Central
[29:09] the church is eternal because it was in
[29:13] the Eternal thoughts of God Amen
[29:16] amen and God
[29:19] wanted to bring a church
[29:22] amen
[29:24] through that church he can continue his
[29:28] work continued dispense his word to the
[29:32] people so Ephesians 3 19 tells us that
[29:36] the church will be
[29:38] filled with the fullness of God
[29:41] it says that
[29:44] amen you might be filled with
[29:48] all the fullness of God
[29:51] so in God's thoughts God's plan
[29:55] the church he is going to erect or build
[30:00] will be filled by God
[30:04] then Collision Colossians says nine
[30:11] two nine four in him dwelt all the
[30:15] fullness of the godhead bodily
[30:20] so God
[30:22] wanted to fill the church with himself
[30:26] according to Ephesians amen 319
[30:30] the church will be filled with the
[30:32] fullness of God
[30:34] and that fullness
[30:37] of God dwelled in Christ's body in
[30:41] Christ
[30:43] amen so then
[30:46] all that God had bodily developed in
[30:50] Christ Jesus and this will be in the
[30:53] church
[30:55] all that was in God yes
[30:59] and God everything all he put
[31:04] in the church
[31:06] amen
[31:08] I mean he put that in Christ
[31:11] [Music]
[31:12] and what was in Christ
[31:16] everything
[31:18] he poured out in the church
[31:21] amen so the church will be filled with
[31:25] the fullness of God
[31:27] because it is the body of Christ in whom
[31:30] the very fullness of the godhead
[31:33] dwells
[31:36] the godhead dwells in US
[31:39] yes the deity is not in heaven
[31:42] but in the bride
[31:44] that's in US so God poor said poured
[31:48] himself into Christ
[31:50] and Christ's word himself into the
[31:54] church
[31:55] so God had bodily the fullness
[31:58] of God is in the church amen
[32:03] so no church and Christ
[32:07] United together
[32:09] Oneness and unity and harmony
[32:12] going back in the millennium
[32:17] to rule amen
[32:20] so there are three things which I would
[32:23] like to talk
[32:25] with you
[32:28] why God has established
[32:32] Church on the Earth
[32:34] three things we will see amen the first
[32:37] is
[32:39] that the church might have the sonship
[32:43] and that God might be expressed through
[32:46] this sonship
[32:48] because we all are called
[32:51] uh to the first born
[32:54] a man
[32:56] so when we receive Christ
[33:00] we become his children
[33:04] amen
[33:06] Ephesians 1 5 says that God
[33:11] predestinated us unto sonship we just
[33:15] read that
[33:16] what does the word sonship mean and what
[33:20] does it include
[33:22] sonship is birth
[33:27] and growth
[33:30] and adoption
[33:32] amen
[33:33] the birth
[33:35] plus the growth
[33:37] plus the adoption means Birthright
[33:41] amen so first of all we must born of God
[33:47] that's how we come in the church not
[33:50] Branham said uh be shaking hand or other
[33:53] things we have to be born
[33:56] because we
[33:58] are born in a family
[34:01] church is a family of God
[34:03] so by this Divine birth we we become
[34:07] the sun we become the Son of God because
[34:11] we have the life of God
[34:14] and after the birth amen God that's how
[34:20] God mingling With Us
[34:23] God's life comes in US
[34:27] and then after the birth we grow in
[34:31] Christ
[34:33] amen be mature
[34:36] amen and when we
[34:40] grow
[34:42] and grow
[34:44] then we
[34:46] at the end in July Birthright
[34:52] different thing and the birthright is
[34:55] different these are two different things
[34:58] we can have the birth but we may not
[35:02] have the birthright
[35:05] and Jacob
[35:07] they both had the birth
[35:10] but Jacob had the birthright
[35:13] amen
[35:15] so after the birth we have to grow
[35:19] increase in Jesus Christ his life should
[35:23] aborn increase
[35:26] grow in US amen so Esau had the life of
[35:31] the Sun
[35:32] but he did not have the sonship for the
[35:36] sonship
[35:38] includes both the birth and the
[35:41] birthright
[35:42] amen
[35:44] so that's why we have to be growing in
[35:46] the Lord amen Romans 8 14
[35:51] to 17 you can write down can read all
[35:55] this later
[35:57] say there is a real difference made
[35:59] between the children and The Heirs
[36:03] the children are the ones who have only
[36:05] the birth but the ears have not only the
[36:08] birth but also the birthright
[36:11] first of all we must become the children
[36:15] of God then through growth we will
[36:18] become the ears amen so we may be a
[36:22] child without the birthright and
[36:24] therefore not have the full sonship
[36:29] like in physical but
[36:33] natural and spiritual
[36:37] type of one another when we were born of
[36:41] our fathers we received life from our
[36:45] father Yes amen but by the birthright
[36:49] anything our fathers have
[36:52] is ours
[36:54] so first we receive the life of the
[36:57] father
[36:59] later we receive everything Our Father
[37:02] owned
[37:04] that's an inheritance right amen so we
[37:08] have not only the life but all that our
[37:12] fathers are and have
[37:14] by spiritual birth
[37:17] we have received the life of God
[37:20] amen
[37:22] but by the birthright we will inherit
[37:24] all that God is and all that he has
[37:28] planned and accomplished
[37:31] everything
[37:34] what God was he poured
[37:38] himself in the church everything and of
[37:43] all this put together is the inheritance
[37:45] life plus the birthright
[37:49] and inheritance amen so the ideal
[37:53] inheritance is to inherit God himself
[37:57] and everything
[38:00] godhead
[38:02] everything
[38:06] what God created
[38:08] is our inheritance the Earth the heaven
[38:12] everything because we saw last Sunday he
[38:16] said
[38:16] rule have dominion over everything
[38:21] fish
[38:24] Over the Sea over the fall of the air
[38:28] Earth even creeping things everything is
[38:32] our domain so when a man
[38:36] when God is born into us
[38:39] he begins
[38:42] this mingling process
[38:45] mingling we and God becomes one
[38:49] when we eat a book when we receive the
[38:51] message of the hour amen
[38:55] when we become the message
[38:57] we become the boy voice for that age
[39:02] we become the written epistle
[39:04] amen living manifestation of the word of
[39:08] God
[39:11] put that this way he said the light that
[39:15] comes into him
[39:16] the man the person who received God is
[39:19] abort like this little white button on
[39:22] my shirt
[39:23] that's when God comes into the inner
[39:26] part of a man amen
[39:29] however this is only the start
[39:32] and then that life started to grow in us
[39:35] so there must be the growth
[39:39] if we have the birth
[39:42] but not growth then we will not reach to
[39:46] the birthright
[39:49] by this process our whole being will be
[39:53] when we grow will be saturated
[39:56] permeated
[39:58] with the a sense of God himself
[40:02] Glory so this is the real Holiness and
[40:06] the real sanctification
[40:10] sanctification is not just that we are
[40:14] separated from the word and we are
[40:17] separated from other things
[40:23] says God had chosen us that we should be
[40:27] holy
[40:29] Amen to be holy means more than to be
[40:32] separated unto God it means to be
[40:34] overlaid with God
[40:37] so you remember in the temple in the
[40:40] Tabernacle
[40:43] Ark and everything was covered overlaid
[40:47] with the with the gold God's nature
[40:51] and the woodage human nature Humanity
[40:54] so we must be overlaid
[40:57] with Christ with his nature amen God
[41:02] predestinated us
[41:04] unto this sonship through Jesus Christ
[41:07] and to himself
[41:09] amen so by this Township
[41:13] by begetting us as Sons sharing his life
[41:18] God makes us his expression and express
[41:23] himself through us
[41:25] why God comes in us why that life he
[41:29] started in us that we may be living
[41:33] expression of God
[41:35] so that's what I am talking the church
[41:39] is his sonship we are his children so we
[41:43] share the same life and that life is
[41:46] that we may Express God
[41:50] the token the life is to display brother
[41:54] Branham
[41:55] God wants us the church to be living
[41:59] expression
[42:01] of God that we may Express
[42:06] the life of God
[42:09] that is the purpose of the church amen
[42:14] so the first thing
[42:16] God wanted to have church is that he may
[42:22] Express himself through the people
[42:26] chosen people who are holy
[42:30] separated
[42:32] amen
[42:34] and they share the same life
[42:37] [Music]
[42:40] expressing that life
[42:43] amen
[42:44] said oh if God can get him prisoners
[42:48] like that now that's when he can express
[42:53] the preeminence
[42:55] you see he has got the man or the person
[42:59] so that he knows nothing but Christ amen
[43:04] amen so a prophet is saying that God
[43:07] looking for that kind of person
[43:11] the church
[43:13] that he may Express himself through them
[43:17] through the church
[43:19] but Branham said the threefold purpose
[43:22] is first to express himself completely
[43:27] God in Christ
[43:29] why God put himself into Christ that son
[43:33] in his son he may have the preeminence
[43:36] then Christ came and and we become Sons
[43:40] so now
[43:43] the same kind of preeminence God wants
[43:46] to see in the church
[43:49] amen
[43:51] second to have the preeminence by this
[43:55] in his church which is his body the
[43:58] bride till he could have the preeminence
[44:00] to express himself through them
[44:04] so this is Christ is the mystery of God
[44:07] revealed but Branham said God is looking
[44:10] for people the church that's his eternal
[44:13] plan
[44:15] yes that he may poured himself his life
[44:19] into them and they may be his
[44:23] expressions
[44:25] that he may completely
[44:28] amen
[44:30] could have the preeminence to express
[44:32] himself through them
[44:35] 156 paragraph and thirdly to restore the
[44:40] kingdom to its rightly position amen
[44:43] said rightly positioned we are going to
[44:46] talk later
[44:48] that fell by sin by the first Adam back
[44:52] to where he walked in the cool of the
[44:55] evening with his people talked with them
[44:58] fellowshipped with them amen
[45:03] so the purpose
[45:05] the church
[45:07] is on the earth that we may be his
[45:10] expression amen
[45:13] amen the same life
[45:16] and but I want to read another paragraph
[45:19] course that's a found in Christ is a
[45:21] mystery again he is expressing himself
[45:24] that is his purpose threefold purple
[45:29] that is his purpose
[45:31] that is why he died
[45:33] that is the second fold of his threefold
[45:37] manifestation first to express his self
[45:41] in Christ then Express himself through
[45:45] the church
[45:47] amen
[45:51] and in there there would be a Time come
[45:54] forth when he could express himself in
[45:58] fullness of his godhead deity
[46:03] said the time is coming
[46:06] and which is now
[46:08] amen because we are at the end time
[46:11] waiting for his coming all the signs all
[46:15] the prophecy all the word
[46:17] which is given for this age before the
[46:20] Rapture everything is full of him
[46:24] so now we are here waiting for his
[46:27] coming
[46:29] said church is coming to that level her
[46:32] level
[46:33] where
[46:35] he
[46:37] I mean the church will fully completely
[46:40] Express that deity God had
[46:46] because God had bodily dwelled in Christ
[46:50] and the Bible says and that that God had
[46:54] bodily made well in Us in fullness
[46:58] in the church so God's purpose
[47:03] to build a church he said I will build
[47:05] my church
[47:07] amen we are just working yes yes we are
[47:10] helper help mate
[47:13] amen but he is the one who is doing his
[47:18] own work the son of man in US
[47:22] looking for The Lost One
[47:25] so we are
[47:29] his hand
[47:31] the church
[47:34] amen amen
[47:36] am said why he sent the Holy Ghost
[47:39] in the church
[47:40] because church is a continuation of the
[47:46] book of Acts
[47:49] we are the furtherance of the Gospel the
[47:51] same life
[47:55] God had
[47:58] established a church
[48:01] that we may have his life
[48:04] like we saw last Sunday
[48:09] amen
[48:13] when I come here
[48:16] so I already prepared a sermon to preach
[48:20] but when I preached last Sunday then
[48:24] Lord change my thoughts
[48:28] and put in my heart let's talk
[48:30] continually about the church
[48:33] so if I go with that subject which I
[48:37] already prepared whom studied
[48:40] nicely so I do not have to like labor
[48:46] work but Lord put these thoughts in my
[48:49] mind to let's go in the same direction
[48:52] so I I believe yes
[48:55] it will be a blessing to all of us
[48:57] amen so we are talking about God's
[49:00] purpose for the church
[49:03] so what is God's purpose why God has
[49:07] called you in the church
[49:09] because church is his administration
[49:13] to dispense his word
[49:17] what God wants to dispense
[49:20] himself his life
[49:23] that we may be living
[49:26] amen expression of that life and we
[49:30] impart that life to the to other people
[49:36] amen that is his purpose to build his
[49:40] church and he said I will build my
[49:42] church
[49:43] nobody knew a human so that's why it's
[49:46] not on human emotion
[49:49] that's not our program but he said I
[49:52] will build my church on the Revelation
[49:54] what Revelation godhead
[49:58] Jesus Christ is God all the fullness of
[50:01] God had bodily dwell in him so in that
[50:05] Revelation I will build my church and
[50:08] that God had boldly will be in the
[50:10] church
[50:11] and the church WIll Express manifest in
[50:15] part that life to other people
[50:20] amen
[50:21] so the next is the so he made us his son
[50:26] when we a man born again in his kingdom
[50:30] we became his sons and daughters
[50:32] children amen who children are
[50:37] children are the extension of the same
[50:39] life amen we are his attributes we are
[50:44] his thoughts his jinns
[50:46] amen
[50:49] we are Branham said a creature of
[50:54] Eternity we are just passing through yes
[50:57] test and trials and Temptation prove we
[51:01] will prove yes
[51:03] that we are the sons and daughters of
[51:06] God
[51:08] amen
[51:09] how
[51:11] knowledge is increased
[51:14] by life this is the time time has come
[51:18] yes
[51:19] to
[51:22] to prove
[51:24] with the life
[51:26] amen
[51:30] so God
[51:34] built his church
[51:37] that he that church be a living
[51:41] manifestation
[51:43] expression
[51:45] of his life
[51:46] and then
[51:48] when church becomes living
[51:51] manifestation
[51:54] when Church expressed his life
[51:57] God's life
[51:59] then that's the house second number God
[52:02] is going to defeat enemy
[52:05] the devil yes because that is second
[52:09] purple
[52:11] amen because when he said I will build
[52:14] my church
[52:15] then in the same breath in the same
[52:18] sentence he said
[52:21] the hell will be against the church
[52:24] I will build my church and the Gates of
[52:28] Hell in the same breath
[52:31] the Gates of Hell will never
[52:35] Prevail against the church
[52:37] so it means whether it is a judge that
[52:40] life that standard that expression of
[52:43] his life then the battle starts
[52:47] with the Satan
[52:49] God is going to prove through us
[52:54] amen
[52:56] amen we are his victory brother
[53:01] amen
[53:02] so we are here to
[53:06] we are here in the battle
[53:08] amen we are in the battle
[53:12] so God's purpose
[53:15] for the church is to deal with his enemy
[53:19] which is devil Satan
[53:23] chapter 1 of Ephesians
[53:26] we see God's purpose for the sonship
[53:30] and then
[53:32] chapter 3 Ephesians
[53:35] we see that enemy may be subdued and
[53:39] come to know God's manifold wisdom
[53:44] amen
[53:48] so God is not sorry
[53:52] that there is a devil
[53:55] there is a Satan disturbing us
[53:58] that is in his plan yes
[54:02] amen
[54:04] amen and God is going to show to the
[54:08] enemy his manifold wisdom through the
[54:12] church it says the Bible said
[54:14] through us through his church amen
[54:18] the enemy may be subdued and come to
[54:21] know God's manifold wisdom God is Not
[54:24] Sorry that there is such an evil one as
[54:28] Satan because without such a man God's
[54:33] manifold wisdom could not be manifested
[54:39] as barbaranam said there is a day and
[54:41] night
[54:42] sunshine and
[54:45] amen and in
[54:47] there is a contrast always
[54:50] amen so it is through all the troubles
[54:54] or originating from Satan that God has a
[54:59] chance to show forth his wisdom but
[55:01] Branham said
[55:03] he did not force Adam and Eve but God
[55:07] knows that they will fall
[55:10] and because they fell
[55:14] that's why God could express his
[55:17] manifold
[55:18] attributes
[55:20] amen his wisdom
[55:24] he's
[55:25] amen
[55:27] godhead father son Healy healer savior
[55:31] all attributes amen sport you have a car
[55:36] nice card and you are uh
[55:41] drive that car
[55:43] and that car never gives you trouble
[55:48] and you you are a good mechanic you can
[55:51] fix
[55:52] but
[55:54] you have no chance
[55:56] to show your wisdom
[56:01] that you can fix this
[56:03] so something like that but when
[56:07] something happened
[56:09] and you fix that and the passenger sees
[56:13] your wisdom so they appreciate and you
[56:17] are all said good mechanic
[56:20] so something like that God let the
[56:24] troubles come
[56:25] let the Satan
[56:27] do whatever he's doing uh on the Earth
[56:31] amen but if you amen
[56:35] when the problem comes in the car
[56:39] amen the people knew what a wonderful
[56:42] driver you are
[56:45] amen so the whole universe has been
[56:48] damaged by Satan
[56:52] but God needs such a one in order that
[56:56] his wisdom might be shown
[56:59] amen yes
[57:02] so what God wanted to show you wisdom
[57:05] his wise God
[57:10] so that's the purpose of the church
[57:14] that he may show his manifold wisdom
[57:18] to his enemy
[57:22] officials 3 9 11 to 11.
[57:26] and to make all menacing what is the
[57:30] Fellowship of the mystery
[57:33] which from the beginnings of the world
[57:36] had been hid in God who created All
[57:40] Things by Jesus Christ then 10 to the
[57:44] intent that now unto the principalities
[57:47] and powers in Heavenly places might be
[57:51] known by the church
[57:54] the manifold wisdom of God
[57:57] according to the Eternal purpose which
[58:00] he had which he purpose in Christ Jesus
[58:03] of the Lord
[58:04] God had a purpose God had a plan yes
[58:08] amen but that
[58:10] purpose and plan was never told to
[58:14] anyone he hid that in himself
[58:19] and then
[58:20] the Bible says he brought a church
[58:25] amen
[58:27] that through that church he might be
[58:30] known by the church the manifold wisdom
[58:33] of God
[58:35] amen
[58:38] so God
[58:40] what he purple here hit in himself
[58:44] wanted to bring that in light
[58:48] that the people may see
[58:50] what was hidden
[58:53] in him what he hide
[58:56] Amen in himself so God wants to bring to
[59:00] life to all his creation
[59:03] the arrangement
[59:06] the dispensation
[59:09] order or economy of its mystery which
[59:13] before the creation of the world was
[59:16] known only by himself because he hid
[59:19] himself hid in himself
[59:22] this economy was hidden in God as
[59:25] mystery
[59:28] so but now God wants to bring to light
[59:31] this
[59:32] plan what he purpose in his heart in
[59:36] order that his manipul wisdom might be
[59:38] known to the rulers and the authorities
[59:41] through the church
[59:44] through US yes
[59:46] this is according to the Eternal purpose
[59:49] the Eternal plan which God purpose and
[59:52] planned in Christ
[59:55] God created man in his own image
[1:00:00] Genesis
[1:00:02] and give him authority to have dominion
[1:00:06] over all the Earth
[1:00:08] amen
[1:00:09] so the Bible says God created man in His
[1:00:13] image
[1:00:16] foreign
[1:00:18] that because God is invisible God
[1:00:23] amen so God created a man that man may
[1:00:27] represent him Express him
[1:00:30] image why God is bringing us into the
[1:00:34] image of Christ the church
[1:00:36] we are coming into the statue of perfect
[1:00:39] man
[1:00:41] coming into his image because we when we
[1:00:45] come into His image
[1:00:47] then we becomes the expression of His
[1:00:51] Image yes
[1:00:53] yes amen
[1:00:56] so if we are not in His image
[1:01:00] we cannot express his life
[1:01:03] so when God created a man he created in
[1:01:07] His image that he may be his expression
[1:01:12] so Man was created to
[1:01:15] Express God's image
[1:01:19] amen amen
[1:01:21] and then
[1:01:24] second thing God said have dominion
[1:01:30] praise God Amen the second thing is have
[1:01:33] dominion over all that
[1:01:36] everywhere so
[1:01:40] amen
[1:01:43] God wants us to
[1:01:46] come in to his image
[1:01:49] become his image and then have dominion
[1:01:54] accept you then he said subdue that
[1:01:58] because Satan was there
[1:02:01] so the next thing is Battle yes
[1:02:04] conquers the Earth
[1:02:07] and keep it
[1:02:11] keep it in order yes
[1:02:15] amen so a man was there for two purples
[1:02:21] to express the image of God
[1:02:25] to express God's life and then
[1:02:27] to
[1:02:29] bring Satan
[1:02:32] under his feet
[1:02:35] to control Satan
[1:02:37] to subdue Satan
[1:02:40] amen so the sonship is the Fulfillment
[1:02:44] of God's image
[1:02:46] when we become his son Adam was his son
[1:02:50] amen so son chip is the Fulfillment of
[1:02:54] God's image
[1:02:55] for it is by the sonship that we will
[1:02:58] eventually be in the full image of God
[1:03:01] to express him
[1:03:03] amen
[1:03:05] so but God not only created a man to
[1:03:08] express himself he also committed his
[1:03:11] full authority to man that he may subdue
[1:03:15] his enemy
[1:03:18] the church is built up by the sonship
[1:03:21] and through the building up of the
[1:03:23] church the enemy is just subdued and
[1:03:27] God's wisdom is displayed
[1:03:30] there is a real order
[1:03:33] amen the more life we have
[1:03:37] the more Life of Christ every time he
[1:03:40] comes in the church
[1:03:42] we
[1:03:44] receive his word
[1:03:46] we are receiving more life his word is
[1:03:49] life
[1:03:50] amen
[1:03:52] so we are growing
[1:03:54] we are receiving more life more life
[1:03:57] more life the more life we have the more
[1:04:01] we built up the more we grow amen and
[1:04:07] when we more grow in the image and the
[1:04:11] likeness
[1:04:13] of Christ in the fullness
[1:04:16] so we become the display
[1:04:20] to the devil
[1:04:23] says your life is a sign board
[1:04:27] advertising something
[1:04:30] so we become the display to the enemy so
[1:04:34] this is a real challenge to the enemy a
[1:04:38] shame to him but a glory to God
[1:04:41] because of our consecrated lives of a
[1:04:45] dedicated life of our holy lives amen is
[1:04:50] a glory to God but Branham said you are
[1:04:55] consecrated your holy life is a thunder
[1:04:58] to the devil
[1:05:01] devil Satan really scared
[1:05:07] when you live a real genuine life
[1:05:13] amen and God always wants a genuine
[1:05:17] article
[1:05:18] and Satan always defeated by genuine
[1:05:22] article
[1:05:25] amen
[1:05:27] this is the goal of God but it is also
[1:05:30] the target of the enemy
[1:05:33] because God's goal is that we may
[1:05:35] Express his life
[1:05:37] so that's why we are the target of the
[1:05:40] devil so we see that there are a lot of
[1:05:43] confusion in the confusion in the
[1:05:46] message churches
[1:05:48] but Branham said that devil is after you
[1:05:50] because he has not caught you yes
[1:05:54] yes so that's why
[1:05:57] because Satan attacked where the life is
[1:06:03] so we are Satan's Target
[1:06:08] and also we are God's goal and purpose
[1:06:13] Genesis 3
[1:06:15] to Revelation chapter 20.
[1:06:19] there is a long record with many stories
[1:06:26] the serpent entered the scene in Genesis
[1:06:30] 3.
[1:06:31] Satan and it is not until Revelation 20
[1:06:36] that the old serpent will be cast
[1:06:39] Bond and Cast Away
[1:06:41] in Revelation 20. so there is a sonship
[1:06:45] and there is a battle with the Enemy
[1:06:49] and that battle
[1:06:53] is always going on
[1:06:56] greatest battle
[1:06:58] that ever fought
[1:07:01] we are here for test and trials
[1:07:05] we are here for the battle
[1:07:09] because Roman says
[1:07:11] God is going to bring Satan under your
[1:07:14] feet
[1:07:16] Jesus Christ defeated him
[1:07:19] at Calvary amen yes
[1:07:22] so now
[1:07:24] he is going to do the same thing through
[1:07:27] us through the church
[1:07:29] amen
[1:07:32] so there is no need for us to be
[1:07:35] sorrowful
[1:07:36] and sad we must always be happy and
[1:07:41] praise the Lord for even a defeat
[1:07:43] our defeat because the battle is going
[1:07:46] on
[1:07:47] amen
[1:07:50] so when the war is going on there are
[1:07:53] many better
[1:07:56] but the victory is at the end
[1:07:59] though we
[1:08:03] though we lose many battles
[1:08:08] but it does not mean that Satan is a
[1:08:11] winner
[1:08:13] our defeat
[1:08:15] sometime we lose is just a preparation
[1:08:18] for a further victory
[1:08:23] even if the enemy defeat us he will
[1:08:26] eventually be defeated
[1:08:29] amen superbraham said
[1:08:34] demonology message Physical Realm in the
[1:08:37] eyes of Lord Satan has already been
[1:08:39] defeated
[1:08:42] and short and show him that he don't do
[1:08:46] not have no legal rights at all
[1:08:49] that Christ defeated him in our stead
[1:08:52] there at Calvary when he died
[1:08:55] amen
[1:08:58] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[1:09:00] reign with him you have to suffer to
[1:09:03] Reign the reason
[1:09:06] the reason for this is that character
[1:09:08] simply is never made without suffering
[1:09:11] character is a victory not a gift
[1:09:15] amen then again
[1:09:17] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:09:19] Brahman said justified in his side we
[1:09:23] are justified in his sight yes why are
[1:09:26] we justifying
[1:09:27] we are his victory
[1:09:31] the church is his victory
[1:09:33] we come forth in this largest with this
[1:09:38] glorious gospel showing his victory he
[1:09:42] died for the purpose and we are proof of
[1:09:45] his victory
[1:09:47] he died for this purpose and we are true
[1:09:50] positive proof of his victory amen when
[1:09:53] we see him coming down and living among
[1:09:56] the church that is his victory so what
[1:10:00] is God's victory
[1:10:02] but Branham said when we see he's coming
[1:10:05] down
[1:10:06] and lives in a church
[1:10:09] and it just becomes his impression
[1:10:13] expression
[1:10:15] so Prophet said that is his victory
[1:10:19] because
[1:10:21] God wants to gain some people
[1:10:25] who are totally completely surrendered
[1:10:28] to him
[1:10:30] amen so then God can express himself
[1:10:34] through them
[1:10:36] through those brothers and sisters
[1:10:41] amen so in God's purpose
[1:10:47] which he purpose in himself but now it's
[1:10:51] revealed
[1:10:52] by the opening of the word
[1:10:56] amen that he want to come down in US you
[1:11:01] Remember The God Who
[1:11:03] LED Israel
[1:11:07] as a pillar of Fire
[1:11:10] he was not
[1:11:12] happy God that is stay above
[1:11:17] one day then he told Moses that he must
[1:11:22] build a tabernacle
[1:11:25] The God Who was above them he came down
[1:11:29] among them
[1:11:31] in that Tabernacle so that's God's
[1:11:34] desire
[1:11:35] Fellowship
[1:11:37] he want to be one with us
[1:11:42] Jesus Christ Our Lord's last prayer is
[1:11:45] that we may
[1:11:47] be one
[1:11:49] as I and father is one amen so his last
[1:11:54] prayer is
[1:11:56] that's God's desire
[1:11:58] that is why he
[1:12:01] amen
[1:12:03] birthday Church on the Earth
[1:12:06] that comes from him his side
[1:12:10] his life in the church
[1:12:13] and then judge lived that life
[1:12:17] show the token
[1:12:19] amen so that is his victory
[1:12:24] we are his victory
[1:12:28] that's why babranam said if you do
[1:12:30] everything
[1:12:31] but you missed that life you missed
[1:12:34] everything
[1:12:34] [Music]
[1:12:36] You Preach you go to church you pay
[1:12:38] tithe you sing you play music whatever
[1:12:41] if you do everything but missed that
[1:12:45] life
[1:12:46] but brother upset my highlight method
[1:12:50] is the token and he preached that
[1:12:52] message many times
[1:12:55] amen
[1:12:57] token life
[1:13:00] Jesus Christ life
[1:13:03] amen he want to live in US
[1:13:06] he wants us to be his living expression
[1:13:10] when we live that life then we become
[1:13:14] his victory Hallelujah
[1:13:16] the church is Victory so I wanted to
[1:13:19] show
[1:13:21] and defeat Satan
[1:13:23] his manifold wisdom through us through
[1:13:26] the church
[1:13:28] that is the second purpose of God
[1:13:31] amen
[1:13:36] that
[1:13:37] Satan may be defeated
[1:13:42] through us the church and that could be
[1:13:45] happen only with the life
[1:13:48] amen
[1:13:50] when that life is there but Branham said
[1:13:53] it cannot be impersonated
[1:13:58] Satan can impersonate
[1:14:01] many things can imitate
[1:14:03] but he cannot produce that life
[1:14:06] God's life in US amen
[1:14:10] praise the Lord
[1:14:11] we are happy that
[1:14:14] that's not by our efforts
[1:14:18] we are not trying to live a life
[1:14:21] they just automatically
[1:14:25] when that life is in you amen that life
[1:14:29] will come into manifestation
[1:14:33] amen so that's easy
[1:14:36] amen
[1:14:40] so God
[1:14:41] created man in His image that he may be
[1:14:45] his expression and then God said have
[1:14:48] dominion over everything it means
[1:14:53] conquer
[1:14:55] fight bring everything in order
[1:14:59] amen
[1:15:00] so now
[1:15:02] the last thing which I want to uh
[1:15:07] share with you is when we started to
[1:15:10] express that life
[1:15:13] Christ mingled with us
[1:15:16] and we are in him
[1:15:19] and he in US
[1:15:21] we become one
[1:15:23] that is God's purpose that he may gather
[1:15:27] everything in Christ Jesus
[1:15:31] amen everything the church
[1:15:34] he's the head
[1:15:36] amen so that God God May
[1:15:40] gather all thing which is in heaven
[1:15:45] amen
[1:15:47] and on Earth all in Christ Jesus
[1:15:51] amen
[1:15:53] so God's plan is the heading up
[1:15:56] of all things in Christ
[1:15:59] amen so we have seen that the sunship is
[1:16:03] for the church
[1:16:05] to express it
[1:16:07] sensifies to express him because we are
[1:16:11] son when we have the life from the
[1:16:13] father
[1:16:15] there is only one way to become son or
[1:16:19] the children when we are born when we
[1:16:22] born then we have the same life amen
[1:16:25] the second is that the church might make
[1:16:28] known to the rulers and the authorities
[1:16:31] the
[1:16:33] manifold wisdom of God in defeating the
[1:16:37] enemy
[1:16:38] amen now the third I would like to take
[1:16:43] is the heading up of all things in
[1:16:47] Christ universally
[1:16:50] because there is only one Church
[1:16:53] that is
[1:16:54] Universal the bride of Christ universal
[1:16:58] church we all there is only one body
[1:17:00] amen
[1:17:03] so the church
[1:17:05] has to have the sonship
[1:17:08] in order to express his life
[1:17:11] then the Satan has to be subdued and
[1:17:15] cast out
[1:17:16] and of all creation has to be brought
[1:17:20] into the proper order and Oneness
[1:17:25] that is our ministry
[1:17:29] that is our purpose on the earth in
[1:17:32] Ephesians 1 10.
[1:17:35] says that he
[1:17:37] might gather together which means head
[1:17:41] up everything in Christ
[1:17:44] so it is God's Eternal purpose
[1:17:47] that in the fullness of the times he
[1:17:51] might head up all things in Christ
[1:17:56] in the fullness of time when the
[1:17:58] completion when you complete everything
[1:18:01] amen
[1:18:03] so when we read
[1:18:07] Ephesians 1 20 22 and 23
[1:18:12] it says
[1:18:15] and his subjected all things under his
[1:18:19] feet and gave him to be had over all
[1:18:23] things
[1:18:25] to the church
[1:18:27] which is his body
[1:18:30] the fullness of the one who fills all in
[1:18:35] all
[1:18:36] amen so 22 verse is
[1:18:41] ah
[1:18:42] signifies the identification and Oneness
[1:18:45] of the church with Christ
[1:18:47] is the head over all things to the
[1:18:50] church which is his body
[1:18:53] amen so when we read Ephesians
[1:18:57] D chip versus
[1:19:00] and
[1:19:01] these verses are closely
[1:19:05] connected with Roman chapter 8
[1:19:12] 17-21
[1:19:14] where it says
[1:19:19] the creation
[1:19:22] the nature
[1:19:24] is waiting for the sons of God for the
[1:19:27] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:19:31] amen so there are many sons of God today
[1:19:35] but the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:19:39] has not yet come
[1:19:42] the nature the creation is waiting for
[1:19:45] the sons of God
[1:19:46] that they may come
[1:19:48] and overtake
[1:19:51] and bring everything in order
[1:19:53] because everything is in disorder
[1:19:59] that is our ministry
[1:20:01] so in verse 20 and 21 Romans
[1:20:05] we read that the whole creation was made
[1:20:08] subject to vanity
[1:20:11] and waits to be delivered from the
[1:20:14] slavery of corruption
[1:20:17] so whole creation is in corruption in
[1:20:21] disorder in confusion at the Manifest
[1:20:25] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:20:27] creation will be delivered from the
[1:20:31] slavery of corruption in vanity into the
[1:20:35] freedom of Glory
[1:20:37] when our bodies are translated we will
[1:20:41] be glorified and this glorification is
[1:20:45] the manifestation amen the manifestation
[1:20:49] of the Son of God is the very glory of
[1:20:52] the sons of God and we are going to be
[1:20:55] glorified
[1:20:57] to whom he justified
[1:20:59] amen he's sanctified
[1:21:02] amen and to whom is sanctified
[1:21:06] he already glorified
[1:21:10] in God everything is finished completed
[1:21:13] amen so Romania tells us that the whole
[1:21:17] creation is the waiting for the glory of
[1:21:21] the son of God
[1:21:23] and then Hebrew 2 Hebrews 2
[1:21:27] said that God now is going to bring many
[1:21:30] sons into Glory
[1:21:32] not one many sons coming into Glory
[1:21:36] when we are brought into Glory that will
[1:21:40] be the fullness of time
[1:21:44] amen the Bible says when the fullness of
[1:21:47] times come
[1:21:48] that he might gather together everything
[1:21:51] in Jesus Christ that he may be the head
[1:21:55] over
[1:21:56] everything
[1:21:58] Jesus Christ all in all that is a full
[1:22:02] will happen
[1:22:03] in the fullness of time amen then all
[1:22:07] creation and all things which are in
[1:22:09] heaven and on Earth
[1:22:11] will be
[1:22:13] headed up in Christ with his body
[1:22:18] amen
[1:22:19] his body is his church we are his body
[1:22:24] amen
[1:22:26] so we must realize that church is the
[1:22:30] only means
[1:22:34] used by God to fulfill his purpose and
[1:22:38] to settle all his problems
[1:22:42] there is many problems
[1:22:46] many problems
[1:22:48] sickness
[1:22:51] confusion
[1:22:54] and death
[1:22:59] when we see around us
[1:23:03] when we listen to the news
[1:23:06] or read the newspapers
[1:23:09] so we
[1:23:12] we are realized that everything is in
[1:23:15] confusion right
[1:23:17] nothing is in order
[1:23:19] all our political systems
[1:23:22] religious systems everything is
[1:23:26] gone
[1:23:28] the church is the very vessel Juiced by
[1:23:31] God to fulfill his purpose which is to
[1:23:35] manifest himself through Man by mingling
[1:23:38] himself with the man this is why God
[1:23:41] created Humanity
[1:23:43] amen but Branham said in the message
[1:23:48] identification
[1:23:49] and now when Christ left
[1:23:53] he Sanctified the church
[1:23:56] that the church might take his place
[1:24:00] and express the word of God
[1:24:04] amen
[1:24:05] so when Christ left
[1:24:10] he raised a church
[1:24:13] a group of people
[1:24:17] amen
[1:24:19] and we are the continuation
[1:24:22] of the same Ministry yes
[1:24:25] same life
[1:24:28] said that
[1:24:30] his the church might take his place and
[1:24:34] express the word of God
[1:24:37] amen
[1:24:39] so God's intention was
[1:24:42] to gain a group of people
[1:24:46] and when God created man in the
[1:24:50] beginning God created man
[1:24:52] to be his vessel
[1:24:55] God we are his vessel
[1:24:59] and God is our content
[1:25:01] we must be filled with God
[1:25:04] must be filled by the Holy Ghost
[1:25:07] because we are the temple of God we are
[1:25:10] the place of the Holy Ghost so we are
[1:25:13] the vessel
[1:25:15] amen the church is the vessel of God
[1:25:19] and God want to be in history
[1:25:25] want to fill that vessel by himself that
[1:25:30] he made well in them and that he may
[1:25:33] manifest himself through them by
[1:25:36] mingling himself with them
[1:25:39] God created man and as the vessels to
[1:25:43] contain himself
[1:25:45] that is what he showed in the beginning
[1:25:48] in the Book of Genesis amen but before
[1:25:51] God could come come into man
[1:25:57] Satan the enemy of God injected himself
[1:26:01] into men
[1:26:05] and then when Satan injected himself
[1:26:09] into man he brought confusion to the
[1:26:12] whole creation
[1:26:18] I would like to read prabhanam's quote
[1:26:20] Maris and divorce
[1:26:22] now listen
[1:26:24] one Interruption supposed the entire
[1:26:27] program
[1:26:29] now when human beings was running in
[1:26:32] continuity with god with the month with
[1:26:36] one man and one woman this woman sinned
[1:26:40] and it threw out the whole Earthly
[1:26:42] program out of continuity with God
[1:26:48] therefore one word added to this book or
[1:26:51] one were taken from it throws a
[1:26:54] Christian offered
[1:26:56] art of continuity with God
[1:26:59] throws a church out of continuity of
[1:27:02] with God throws a family out of
[1:27:05] continuity with God
[1:27:08] now we see being there the continuity is
[1:27:13] broken
[1:27:14] when man sin right
[1:27:19] right but Branham said
[1:27:21] God's program interrupted
[1:27:24] but God's program cannot be defeated
[1:27:28] interrupted
[1:27:29] now we see being that the continuity
[1:27:33] is broken then the lifeline was broken
[1:27:37] also the timeline was broken the
[1:27:40] Covenant was broken everything shattered
[1:27:48] so Satan
[1:27:50] injected himself
[1:27:53] into human
[1:27:57] and then the confusion
[1:27:59] the death
[1:28:02] came in the creation of God
[1:28:05] and creation
[1:28:08] came under the bondage of corruption in
[1:28:12] vanity
[1:28:14] because Satan injected himself
[1:28:18] God made us that
[1:28:21] he made Valley in US
[1:28:23] Satan is a perverted he cannot create so
[1:28:27] he perverted
[1:28:29] he perverted life
[1:28:32] he pervert people
[1:28:36] so he provided this corruption came from
[1:28:39] Darkness
[1:28:41] the darkness came from death
[1:28:44] and the death came from Satan
[1:28:50] so God has many problems
[1:28:54] when this Interruption came when the
[1:28:56] continuity was broken
[1:28:59] when men disobeyed the word and he has
[1:29:03] death sickness confusion corruption
[1:29:07] bondage and vanity in his creation
[1:29:11] even now the whole creation is croony
[1:29:15] Prime weeping
[1:29:17] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:29:20] sons of God
[1:29:22] that may come
[1:29:25] and deliver
[1:29:27] the creation from the bondage of Satan
[1:29:32] which is in the vanity
[1:29:35] amen God must liberate his creation from
[1:29:39] boundary and bring it into the order of
[1:29:42] Liberty by heading up all things under
[1:29:46] the hardship of Christ because only
[1:29:49] Christ can
[1:29:51] bring everything in order
[1:29:54] and we see that everything in the world
[1:29:57] is failed
[1:29:59] all government all political everything
[1:30:04] only Christ can restore everything
[1:30:07] so how will God
[1:30:10] recover his creation and fulfill his
[1:30:13] original purpose in creating man so how
[1:30:16] is God going to do that first of all
[1:30:20] we must see that Satan brought confusion
[1:30:26] because he
[1:30:28] he preached something said he always
[1:30:31] take the same subject that's how he
[1:30:33] create confusion
[1:30:37] so he created confusion
[1:30:40] Satan always con confused the people
[1:30:43] how he create Confusion by injecting
[1:30:46] himself into man as death
[1:30:50] Satan is death and God is life
[1:30:54] amen
[1:30:56] God is life
[1:30:59] and Satan is death
[1:31:02] amen
[1:31:07] so now
[1:31:10] how God will restore his creation
[1:31:16] Satan created all confusion
[1:31:22] brought to death
[1:31:25] damage God's creation there is damage
[1:31:28] everywhere
[1:31:32] because he perverted everything Satan
[1:31:37] amen
[1:31:38] so gods
[1:31:41] plan
[1:31:43] to restore
[1:31:45] his creation
[1:31:47] amen
[1:31:48] is to impart himself into us as life
[1:31:53] because Satan injects himself
[1:31:56] into amen and that's all that came
[1:32:01] so Jesus came
[1:32:03] he is our life he said I am the life
[1:32:08] amen so the life came
[1:32:12] why the light has come
[1:32:14] that he may impart
[1:32:17] his life
[1:32:20] amen so God's answer to devil
[1:32:25] the Satan is Alive
[1:32:28] amen the token yes amen
[1:32:33] amen the token
[1:32:37] what is token
[1:32:40] the pride has been paid
[1:32:44] token means
[1:32:50] somebody
[1:32:53] has paid the price
[1:32:56] somebody died instead of us
[1:33:01] amen
[1:33:02] and then
[1:33:05] that token it
[1:33:10] lamb is killed
[1:33:13] bloody sprinkled yes
[1:33:15] outside the door on the lintel
[1:33:20] and under that blood
[1:33:23] because death is outside
[1:33:26] Satan death outside its death
[1:33:31] a thought is coming so let me say so I
[1:33:34] was trying to hold it
[1:33:36] sometime I notice in the church
[1:33:40] in my place
[1:33:42] sometime people comes
[1:33:45] this is
[1:33:46] sometimes they said pastor
[1:33:49] this this month I do not want to partake
[1:33:54] in the communion
[1:33:56] I will take next time
[1:34:01] this is not the way we should approach
[1:34:04] to the table
[1:34:07] but Branham said when you come under the
[1:34:09] blood
[1:34:10] stay there
[1:34:13] it cannot be like sometimes you go
[1:34:16] outside
[1:34:17] and then you come back
[1:34:21] when you come under the blood stay there
[1:34:26] communion is only under the blood
[1:34:30] so when they sprinkle the blood
[1:34:34] under that blood they were eating the
[1:34:36] communion they were eating the lamb amen
[1:34:41] so that's the communion
[1:34:43] and that's the life amen
[1:34:48] that is the price
[1:34:50] so what is God's answer
[1:34:53] it's a life
[1:34:55] he gave himself
[1:34:58] and died for us
[1:35:00] but Branham said the blood cell was
[1:35:02] broken why
[1:35:04] to release the life
[1:35:07] Amen in the form of the Holy Ghost and
[1:35:11] that life that token has come back in
[1:35:14] the church to keep judge alive
[1:35:18] amen that is God's purpose amen so judge
[1:35:25] Ministry our ministry
[1:35:29] now on Earth is not to preach doctrines
[1:35:33] yeah we have the sound doctrines praise
[1:35:36] the Lord
[1:35:37] doctrines and Christ are two different
[1:35:39] things when we
[1:35:42] make circle around any Doctrine
[1:35:45] Doctrine means religion
[1:35:51] but Christ
[1:35:53] we cannot
[1:35:54] uh
[1:35:57] put Christ in any Circle
[1:36:00] amen he is more more than adopted that's
[1:36:03] why this message is not a bunch of
[1:36:06] Doctrine
[1:36:07] this mess
[1:36:10] Mighty Angel the life has come down
[1:36:14] amen
[1:36:16] it's a book
[1:36:21] amen so if you see that our ministry is
[1:36:26] not make circle that we believe this we
[1:36:28] believe this but Branham said never put
[1:36:32] full stop
[1:36:34] because Revelation is always coming
[1:36:37] coming Revelation never stop
[1:36:42] is keep on coming it's bubbling bubbling
[1:36:45] it's a fountain it's a life
[1:36:48] amen so that's why
[1:36:51] until now we believe what program
[1:36:54] preached
[1:36:56] and when we read more when we listen
[1:36:58] again again those men those stems sermon
[1:37:02] the more things more understanding is
[1:37:05] coming we are growing
[1:37:08] and amen and we are preaching
[1:37:12] I told to the church that I am not
[1:37:15] omniscient
[1:37:17] I'm learning so if I say something to
[1:37:21] you and
[1:37:24] that is according to my present
[1:37:26] understanding from the message because
[1:37:28] the messages keep on unfolding coming
[1:37:31] coming coming
[1:37:33] amen
[1:37:36] so we cannot stop anywhere
[1:37:38] so our ministry is to impart Christ
[1:37:45] I was reading
[1:37:47] about the missionaries
[1:37:49] I really want to know how they sacrifice
[1:37:53] their lives many missionaries they uh
[1:37:57] buried their children
[1:38:00] ah
[1:38:02] when they were traveling on the way
[1:38:06] great sacrifice I wanted to read about
[1:38:08] them how they uh
[1:38:12] they spread the gospel and I was reading
[1:38:16] somewhere when Wesley
[1:38:20] the messenger to the sixth churches amen
[1:38:25] he went to preaching
[1:38:27] and
[1:38:29] many places when he came back his
[1:38:31] brother Charles met him at the door
[1:38:34] and he asked him
[1:38:36] what you
[1:38:39] had given to the people
[1:38:43] he said I give Christ
[1:38:45] amen
[1:38:46] because Christ is life so Church
[1:38:51] amen
[1:38:52] comes out of Christ
[1:38:56] the same life
[1:38:58] that we may impart that life that we may
[1:39:02] give Christ
[1:39:05] Jesus Christ
[1:39:07] the anointed word
[1:39:09] to the people
[1:39:11] amen am said that day on Calvary now
[1:39:16] notice that Greater Works was to have
[1:39:20] the power in the church not only to heal
[1:39:23] the Sick by prayer cast or Devils by
[1:39:26] prayer but to impart eternal life to
[1:39:29] Believers the Holy Ghost was coming and
[1:39:33] given into the heads of the church to
[1:39:36] impart life
[1:39:39] that's what Calvary mean
[1:39:41] s that
[1:39:44] the Holy Ghost is given Holy Ghost God's
[1:39:49] life is given
[1:39:51] into the hands of the church to impart
[1:39:54] life
[1:39:56] so the gods answer to devil because
[1:40:00] devil brought death that is our last
[1:40:03] enemy yes
[1:40:04] yes amen
[1:40:06] so our ministry is to impart life
[1:40:10] and that life is Jesus Christ
[1:40:14] and that life is Lord few courts
[1:40:18] give the whole message to the people
[1:40:21] whole message is important and God will
[1:40:24] reveal what God wants to be revealed to
[1:40:27] them
[1:40:27] poor blind wretched people
[1:40:33] that they own Calvary
[1:40:34] how do you miss that
[1:40:37] don't you see what the greater thing is
[1:40:41] that is the greatest thing could ever
[1:40:43] happen was to impart eternal life to
[1:40:47] people what is eternal life the life
[1:40:51] that he lived
[1:40:53] what is eternal life the life that he
[1:40:56] lived and when that life is in US
[1:41:00] Prophet said that is his victory amen
[1:41:04] amen amen
[1:41:06] the life that he lived the life that was
[1:41:10] in him in part
[1:41:14] to the church our ministry of Branham
[1:41:16] said the life that he lived that life he
[1:41:20] poured in that church our message to
[1:41:23] impart that life to the people
[1:41:26] amen
[1:41:28] impart that life to the people
[1:41:31] to others
[1:41:33] amen
[1:41:35] amen
[1:41:38] so when that life comes in US
[1:41:41] the Bible says that life is a light
[1:41:46] John 1 4 in him was life and the life
[1:41:50] was the light of men
[1:41:52] John 8 12 Jesus said I am the light of
[1:41:56] the world
[1:41:57] he who follows me shall be no means walk
[1:42:01] in darkness but shall have the light of
[1:42:05] life
[1:42:08] when God comes as
[1:42:12] comes in us as life there is a light
[1:42:16] that shines within us as a light of life
[1:42:20] we shines
[1:42:22] that life shines because when The Candle
[1:42:25] is lit Jesus Christ said cannot be high
[1:42:29] when we express that life become like a
[1:42:34] city on the hill cannot be hidden
[1:42:38] but we show the light to The Traveler
[1:42:42] give the direction
[1:42:43] impart that life to the people amen
[1:42:48] amen
[1:42:51] God's way of
[1:42:53] restoration is Christ versus Satan
[1:42:58] life versus death light versus darkness
[1:43:01] and Order versus confusion that's why
[1:43:05] prabhana
[1:43:06] give us a message Cod
[1:43:09] Ed and auction of the church
[1:43:12] amen
[1:43:14] conduct order and doctrine of the church
[1:43:16] amen
[1:43:19] we saw the Earth and we noticed that
[1:43:22] everything was in order
[1:43:24] amen when God is there nothing
[1:43:28] could be in this order amen so when we
[1:43:31] are filled with Christ we will be full
[1:43:35] of life and completely
[1:43:37] walking in the light
[1:43:40] in the present tense message the light
[1:43:43] amen if we are not filled with Christ as
[1:43:46] life then we are in darkness
[1:43:49] because that life is life
[1:43:52] and that is why
[1:43:54] the message come as evening light
[1:43:58] it shall be light in the evening time
[1:44:00] yes
[1:44:01] amen
[1:44:03] so before Satan come into God's creation
[1:44:06] there was Unity
[1:44:09] and harmony
[1:44:10] and Order
[1:44:12] everything was good nice continuity was
[1:44:17] there
[1:44:18] but Satan came and he injected death in
[1:44:23] God's creation and darkness confusion
[1:44:26] disorder all things came so God's way of
[1:44:30] restoration and Recovery in Redemption
[1:44:33] is God
[1:44:35] recovers restore everything by life
[1:44:41] and that's God's own life not our life
[1:44:44] amen
[1:44:46] amen
[1:44:48] it looks like
[1:44:51] God is
[1:44:54] not working
[1:44:55] because we cannot see him
[1:44:58] but God is working silently
[1:45:01] in the lives of the people
[1:45:05] a man
[1:45:08] God is working silently and in a living
[1:45:12] way changing the lives of the people
[1:45:15] God's work are not like big shoe or
[1:45:19] something big God always works in simple
[1:45:23] City amen
[1:45:25] so when we receive God
[1:45:28] in us as our life
[1:45:30] he comes into us as the very light and
[1:45:34] under this light we are
[1:45:37] when we walk in light then we have
[1:45:39] Fellowship we are in unity we are in
[1:45:42] perishing we are in harmony amen so
[1:45:46] there is something living within us
[1:45:48] shining all the time and we are walking
[1:45:52] under this light amen
[1:45:56] so when that life comes that life is
[1:46:00] light
[1:46:01] and that light
[1:46:03] remove all the darkness because he has
[1:46:07] chosen us and brought us into his life
[1:46:10] amen
[1:46:13] to
[1:46:15] to
[1:46:17] to manifest his virtue
[1:46:20] his life
[1:46:22] amen
[1:46:25] that's in the Bible I mean there is a
[1:46:28] written there so by God has life
[1:46:33] when it life that life comes
[1:46:36] we becomes
[1:46:37] light
[1:46:39] candlestick lampstand
[1:46:42] amen
[1:46:43] a candle
[1:46:45] which is lit
[1:46:47] gives light to others
[1:46:50] shows the life amen
[1:46:53] amen
[1:46:54] so when light comes remove all the
[1:46:58] darkness
[1:47:00] amen so in God's purpose
[1:47:03] that through the church Christ should
[1:47:06] head up all things together but he can
[1:47:09] only be accomplished through the church
[1:47:13] because he has
[1:47:16] established a church for that purpose
[1:47:20] amen so this is
[1:47:22] that's why Jesus said
[1:47:25] my father are one
[1:47:28] that day you will know that I am in the
[1:47:31] father
[1:47:32] and the father in me
[1:47:34] I am Jew and you in me the Oneness and
[1:47:39] the Harmony and the unity amen so by the
[1:47:43] grace of God by the opening of the
[1:47:46] message amen
[1:47:48] we see that God's plan is to what
[1:47:51] himself into us as life
[1:47:56] yes amen so he is working himself in US
[1:48:02] as life
[1:48:03] God's purpose with the church is to work
[1:48:07] himself into us as life that we may be
[1:48:11] full of life
[1:48:13] because the word is in darkness yes rise
[1:48:17] and shine your light has come amen
[1:48:21] so that is God's purpose
[1:48:24] that's what God wants
[1:48:26] us to do because he said the bride the
[1:48:30] church knows what she wants to done with
[1:48:32] the word amen
[1:48:34] amen amen so this will be the fullness
[1:48:37] of time when we
[1:48:39] Express that life
[1:48:42] amen and we impart that life
[1:48:45] Christ and bride one no two
[1:48:49] amen husband and wife
[1:48:52] is one amen
[1:48:55] so the old serpent will be cast out into
[1:49:00] the Lake of Fire And even death
[1:49:04] I mean The Last Enemy
[1:49:07] yes amen will be Cast Away
[1:49:10] that's revelation
[1:49:12] in the Book of Revelation
[1:49:15] in the end it will happen amen so when
[1:49:18] that happened the creation will be
[1:49:20] liberated from the bondage of corruption
[1:49:22] in vanity and brought into the liberty
[1:49:24] of the glory of the sons of God but all
[1:49:28] this depends
[1:49:31] upon
[1:49:32] on on
[1:49:34] us the church all it depends on the work
[1:49:37] of God
[1:49:38] within us
[1:49:41] God is working out
[1:49:44] in a church
[1:49:45] as a corporate vessels
[1:49:48] amen
[1:49:51] in a group of people that it might be
[1:49:54] the life and the light to express and
[1:49:56] shine
[1:49:57] amen that we may shine his glory we may
[1:50:01] shine his life that we may Express his
[1:50:04] life with all the church God could never
[1:50:07] add up all things in Christ
[1:50:11] amen because first he shows that
[1:50:14] preeminence in the son that son sure
[1:50:18] shows that preem Eminence in the church
[1:50:21] amen he takes the same kind of Prim
[1:50:24] Eminence then that same preeminent
[1:50:27] is in the word what he shows in the
[1:50:30] church in US amen so then we together in
[1:50:35] unity and Harmony imparting that life
[1:50:38] amen because we have received that life
[1:50:41] then we are imparting that life to the
[1:50:44] people this will release all creation
[1:50:46] from confusion
[1:50:48] and bring into Liberty
[1:50:51] because we are working together God
[1:50:53] working in US
[1:50:55] what we are doing what is our ministry
[1:50:58] we are
[1:50:59] people are confused
[1:51:02] in the churches
[1:51:05] wherever they are God sent us a message
[1:51:09] with that message we bring the people
[1:51:13] in unity Harmony and move all the
[1:51:17] confusion
[1:51:20] we bring the people in order
[1:51:22] their lives in order the churches in
[1:51:25] order because the life the world has
[1:51:28] come
[1:51:29] that's how that's what God wants us to
[1:51:32] do amen so
[1:51:35] amen
[1:51:36] so when the sonship of God is fully
[1:51:41] fulfilled
[1:51:42] amen
[1:51:44] in US and we become the full expression
[1:51:48] of that life
[1:51:49] then
[1:51:51] God deals through us
[1:51:53] with his enemy
[1:51:55] amen
[1:51:57] ensures his victory and manifold wisdom
[1:52:01] to the devil
[1:52:03] amen yes yes
[1:52:05] because God
[1:52:08] wants to deal with his
[1:52:12] uh creature
[1:52:14] created creature through the other
[1:52:18] preach creature he created us
[1:52:21] amen
[1:52:23] it's in the Bible it's maybe psalm 8.
[1:52:27] that he put everything under man
[1:52:31] and he made man little lower than the
[1:52:35] angel I mean but we do not see that man
[1:52:37] but that's coming
[1:52:39] amen
[1:52:41] Jesus did that fulfilled in him amen
[1:52:45] so everything is coming
[1:52:49] into our
[1:52:50] control
[1:52:52] under our feet that kind of man
[1:52:56] God has created to rule amen so the
[1:53:00] second thing is we God want us to deal
[1:53:03] with enemy amen so then when we deal
[1:53:08] with the Enemy
[1:53:09] defeated him God defeated enemy through
[1:53:12] us he did that already
[1:53:15] amen but that life in US
[1:53:18] amen uh uh
[1:53:22] defeat Devil that's Satan
[1:53:25] so when we are in that kind of unity
[1:53:29] with God
[1:53:31] same life
[1:53:33] same word
[1:53:36] then we
[1:53:37] are going in the millennium
[1:53:40] then everything will be completed that
[1:53:44] is the fullness of time amen everything
[1:53:46] God will headed up in Christ amen
[1:53:51] Hallelujah
[1:53:52] so even today when we preach to the
[1:53:55] people
[1:53:57] and they believe the message
[1:53:59] receive the Gospel
[1:54:01] they enjoy
[1:54:04] that life
[1:54:06] they enjoy that poor taste
[1:54:09] of the coming Kingdom
[1:54:12] amen
[1:54:14] so we are his sons and daughters
