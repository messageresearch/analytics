join in and we just want to say we love you all anden while we're standing let's look at Luke chap chapter 2 and we're going to go Luke chapter 2:8 and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were soore afraid and angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people For unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the Lord amen God bless you as you have your seats amen God is good before I break into this keep your place in the scripture we're going to read through this but I just want to let you know that uh this coming week my family and I are going to get away for a couple days we had a little window of opportunity where David was off school the girls had a few days off so we're jumping on and we're going to spend a few days together so I won't be here Wednesday night but brother Ben SEO will be taking the service so remember him in prayer and we'll be back for the uh Sunday service for New Year's Eve amen when we look at this scripture I I I look at this and I I remember whenever we get to this season of time I always reflect on all the Christmas messages that brother Brandon preached some of the greatest messages that were ever preached were at Christmas time and I love the way brother Brandon preached his Christmas messages because you know while while so much of of the world I mean even in his day we're preaching about an event that had transpired 2,000 years ago brother Brandon would take the event that transpired 2,000 years ago he' bring it right to our day and he would show us that the same thing continues on Amen and he preached uh in 1960 he preached God's wrapped gifts amen showing us that God's gifts still come wrapped amen and how are they wrapped they're wrapped behind a veil of Flesh God still has gifts in this day but they're wrapped gifts amen and Jesus was a wrapped gift wrapped in swaddling cloth which was what amen it was the it was it was the the the fabric off the inside of a yok it was nothing absolutely nothing that you would desire no special garment no nothing of praiseworthy it smelled like the ox it was it was rough amen but what was it it was it was the Garment that Christ would be wrapped in amen and when the shepherd saw him where how would they shame they would see a wrapped gift amen and it wasn't what the wrapping was it was what inside the the wrapping that mattered and inside this wrapping it may be rough and it may be smelly and it may but praise God there's a gift inside amen I I love how brother brandham could take Christmas amen and preach the message then in 1963 he preached why little Bethlehem he preached we have seen a star and have come to worship Him amen we know in this day we have seen a star yeah amen the Morning Star showing the rising of the Sun and we' have seen a star and come to worship him and he says and he preached God's gifts always find their place places that was good in 1964 he preached why it had to be Shepherds had to be Shepherds amen and he goes and preaches that amen and and we're going to uh read this scripture this morning but I love those messages and and I I didn't do it this year but usually every every year around December I start going through all of them and listening to all of them I didn't get a chance to do that this year but they've always meant a lot to me and I don't just listen to them at Christmas time I like why little Bethlehem I listen to that all the time that's an outstanding message but this time when the world is is reflecting the whole world is is is believing that Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem they believe the story of the baby in the manger amen but as we just sang amen there's still a Manger amen there's still amen a birth taking place only now he's been being born in you and I amen so the story is just as relevant today as it's ever been we brother Brandon preached the message uh and that message was calling him out of History amen calling him out of history and I say today let's call him out of History amen let's not just reflect on the historical acts of Jesus but what's going on now what does Christmas mean to us now when brother brand come and preach that is the rising of the sun amen he and he preached the Easter seal and the rising of the sun these were Easter messages and brother brandham said what does Easter mean what does it mean to you and I amen what does it mean to us today not that Jesus just Rose 2,000 years ago but what does Easter have to do with us today and then brother brandom started showing hey it's Resurrection now amen we've been resurrected out of denominationalism we've been brought amen into newness of life into the word of the hour he said what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is he says now it's Easter with me and Jesus and you and I and Jesus it's Easter with all of us it's Easter amen so brother benam never left the historical events in history he always brought it to our day and say what was there is here amen what was there that day is here this day praise God I love a present tense Revelation because it gives us life today so when we look at at this this scripture that we just read the Shepherds were keeping watch over their flocks by night and the angel of the Lord bed them in the glory of the Lord and gave them a message for unto you was born this day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the Lord amen this birth was a birth with a purpose that's what I'm going to talk about to today born for for a purpose and then for a subtitle I'd like to take preventing the manifestation born for a purpose he was born to save men from their sins he was born to be the savior of the world Amen and we know to do that he would give his life so he was born to die in our place to be the sacrificial lamb he was born with a purpose let's pick up the story over here in verse 15 and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them un Heaven the Shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us amen it's amazing that the Shepherds brother bam when he preached why had to be Shepherds he was talking about he was talking about uh men who were illiterate they were uneducated they were they were you know not in the in group of society but they were out a bit separated and he talked about they were simple amen they weren't the priest they weren't the high priest they weren't the well educated amen and these these simple men these simple Shepherds that were out here doing the work of a Shepherd amen how who else would recognize the birth of a lamb who else was there to attend the birth of lambs this was the Lamb of God coming to the Earth it's very fitting that the angel would notify the Shepherds the Shepherds would need to know that there's a newborn lamb amen but them being the simple men that they are amen they didn't say let us go to Bethlehem and do some investigation and find out is true they believed it as soon as the angel told them they believed that let's say let let they said let's go see this thing that's been done oh why did it have to be Shepherds because they were simple enough to believe the Angel's message amen and what are we to be not religious amen not theologians not highly educated we need be as simple and humbled as the Shepherds to recognize amen the Angel's message is true let's go see this that's been done amen the word has returned let's not analyze it let's not take scientific analysis of it and see no let's go see it it's done it's here let's go witness this thing why I had to be Shepherds because Shepherds could receive this message verse 16 and they came in haste and found Mary and Joseph and the baby lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning the child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the Shepherds so the first Earthly Herald of the newborn king was Shepherds simple humble Shepherds who did God send with the message of the birth of Christ amen to their fellow man he sent the angel to the Shepherds he sent the Shepherds to everybody else in Bethlehem and they wondered at what these Shepherds were talking about not they're not the normal oracles amen for the word of God they weren't the they weren't the customary amen Oracle that they were used to hearing great messages from God from amen but they were exactly right on par with what God wanted amen amen we not we may not be much amen we may not be the upper crusted Society but praise be to God if we can be like Shepherds we can run through the city proclaiming that Christ is here amen he is here and the message Shalom brother B says that son is the word of God the beginning God said let there be light and when the manifested word of God when the word of God was manifested there was light first God spoke it what if it didn't manifest then it wasn't light yet but when he spoke it and then it was manifested Vindicated his word was a Vindicated light came into existence and that's the only way it can be done now is when the word is Vindicated God's written word Vindicated then it shows light it's a it's a portion is lit or put out for each age we find in the church ages we find in the Old Testament Church ages each time that there came a time a certain manifestation of the journey there was a prophet came to Earth and the word came to the prophet and he made that word live and when that word was identified it reflected God and there was the age there was the light and that's the way light comes today am how when God when it's a when it's a time for another age another dispensation God would send the prophet the Prophet would declare the word amen and and that word would be Vindicated and it became the light for that age there was a prophecy amen a prophecy laying in the word that a virgin shall conceive a child shall be born unto us amen and and and the government shall be upon his shoulder we know that these prophecies are laying there there was a prophecy all the way back in Genesis chter 3 that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent so there's been a prophecy of this seed coming down all through and now now it was a word it was a word it was a word but now it's manifested word amen and so now we see that Jesus says let's turn together to John chapter 8 together and let's look at this John chapter 8:12 in John 8:12 he says then spake Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life amen what made him the light of the world because he was the manifested word for his day he was that prophecy he was that word The Prophecy from Genesis 3 The Prophecy from Isaiah chapter 7 The Prophecy from Isaiah 53 all these prophecies were round up in him and now he wasn't he wasn't just the word because the word was already there he was the manifested word and he says I am the light of the world Amen and he was the manifested word amen and that's where the rub always comes friends it always starts a battle it always starts a war war is when the word comes into manifestation amen because once the word Goes Forth the spoken word of God the devil can do nothing to retract that word that word's already been spoken and a spoken word of God will go out there and circle around the earth amen that's what brother abam said amen Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive that word went forth and that word was circling around the globe waiting till that word could drop and it's appointed time and it's appointed Place amen and he can't stop that word from moving around but what he's trying to do is prevent the manifestation amen because the manifestation of that word brings light and light brings life amen amen when when uh when Jes when God Amen told uh his his uh new formed son he says go forth multiply and replenish amen that was the word of God the spoken word was given to the son and his son's wife to multiply and replenish amen and he can't stop that word he can't stop that word that God spoke as a prophecy amen but what does the devil do he comes to Mar the manifestation and he comes and he gets into the womb of the woman Amen to try to disrupt the manifestation of that word because the manifestation of the word brings life yeah amen right this is what the devil has always tried to do he began to to to try to either prevent or pervert or or or sometime hold back the manifestation of that word because when the word comes in the manifestation amen it begins to end something for him let's go to John chapter 3 look at another scripture here he said I am the light of the world he that followeth me walketh shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of Life John 3: 19 says and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved this is the reason that the devil would always use these who hate the light to try to put out the light right because the light was a reprove to them let's turn to Matthew Chapter 2 Matthew chapter 2 verse 1 Matthew 2 verse 1 says now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the east of Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him when Herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him why was he troubled amen here was the prophecy coming to fulfillment here were these wise men coming saying the time of the prophecy is now at hand but Herod Who Loved darkness and not lie he was troubled because the word was coming into manifestation and and now uh verse four and then he had gathered all the chief priests and the scribes of the people together he demanded of them where Christ should be born and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah art not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel then Herod when he had privately called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when you have found him bring me word again that I might come and worship him also so here is Herod he's sitting he's a tetrarch he's sitting as a king amen over uh Judea and and when he finds out that the wise men come with a with a message amen that we've seen the sign in the heavens amen we've seen the star declaring the birth of Christ amen all the all of a sudden he's troubled amen this this is perplexing to him because now Christ has come amen for the rest of the world for those who are trapped in darkness and want light this is the greatest thing that we could ever hear for the Shepherds it was a wonderful message for Herod it was perplexing and troubling so he he FS that he wants to worship him so he says go and and then diligently seek out the child before he sends him he ask when did this star appear what when did you first see the sign in the heaven he's trying to determine when Jesus was born and he's acting super interested in the word and the Fulfillment of Prophecy and he is very interested in the Fulfillment of Prophecy not because he loves light but because he loves darkness and he's afraid of the light now we go down to verse 16 after the wise men left by another way being warned of God verse 16 it says then Herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men was exceeding wroth and sent forth and SLE slew excuse me slew all the children that were in Bethlehem and all the coast thereof from 2 years old and under according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men amen Not only was he troubled about the birth of the word he was trying to kill it this is the condemnation to the world that light is come to the world and Men loved Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil he didn't love the Fulfillment of the word he didn't love the prophecy coming to manifestation no matter what he pretended to like and no matter what kind of religious ceremony or whatever kind of religious pretense he put on when it came down to it when the prophecy moved from the spoken word prophecy to manifestation now he had to kill the manifestation and this has been the tactic of the devil all the way through he's trying to stop that manifestation amen and we know that he can't stop it amen he's only been attempting to stop it but we see all of his efforts from the very beginning In the Garden of Eden all the way through to today he's trying to stop the manifestation of the word but what God has spoken amen will come to pass amen nothing will stop the manifestation of the word but he's sure on a rampage to try to stop it to squelch it amen to to do all he can to discredit it disprove it amen put a black mark upon it he's trying to keep everybody away from the manif a amen let's go to John 18 you know I first titled this uh born with a purpose and I want to look at what Jesus says here in John chapter 18 he's standing before Pilate he's been arrested put on trial he's undergoing questioning from pilate and in John 18:37 he says pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a King Jesus had just said my kingdom is not from the earth my Kingdom's from above if my kingdom was from Earth my subjects would fight for me but my kingdom is not from here my kingdom is from above and he says Thou Art King he says you say that I'm a king but then Look what Jesus says to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth why was Jesus born born to Bear witness of the truth this is what he says to this end was I born this is the reason that I've been born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice amen what was the purpose of Jesus we know he's born to be the Savior he's born to be the Lamb of God he's born to take away the sins of the world that's all the purpose but when Jesus stands before Pilate he said this is the reason I came into the world for this purpose I I was born to Bear witness of the truth amen and everybody that loves the truth will hear my voice amen if that was Jesus's purpose I want that to be my purpose amen why have I been born again amen my first birth I come into the Earth but God knew when I would be planted God knew what time I would come and he planted a seed in this earth and down in my soul was a SE Gene of God and he knew when it would come forth he knew what vessel it would be trapped in and he knew what journey I would be on and where in the journey that he would meet that seed and bring it to life but I've been born again amen this is the reason I've been born this is the reason to Bear witness of the truth that's the reason I've been born again that's the reason I've encountered this message that's the reason the light of this hour has struck the seed and BR it to life is so that I can bear witness of the truth that's why he came that's why we've come amen we've been born for a purpose and born again for the purpose of God but just as the devil never was welcoming to the manifestation of the word he's still not today yeah right amen Jesus I I want to I want to look at John chapter 8 I'm flipping back and forth in John here but I like the Book of John that when you look at the four gospels John is the bride's gospel through and through amen it's it's got the eagle anointing on it amen so John 8:31 then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him so there was a whole slew of Jews that believed on him they would eventually Fade Away amen but they were Believing on him at this point and here's what he says if you continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make shall make you free oh my goodness and you know you know what this was perplexing to the Jews because the next statement they say we're Abraham's children and never were in bondage to any man how can you say you'll make us free amen they were looking at a natural condition and he was looking at a spiritual condition and he says I will speak the truth amen let's see it again uh if you continue in my word this is why brother brandham said you know Judas was walking in the word but Judas couldn't continue in the word he couldn't go all the way to Pentecost amen that's why brother said the greatest evidence I know of of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen is being able to go all the way with the word not getting hung up somewhere amen Judas got hung up somewhere many got hung up somewhere Deus got hung up somewhere and could no longer continue with Paul amen but not that you just can believe because he's saying these were the Jews who believed on him but if you continue all the way through that's the greatest evidence that brother bham knew of of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he said if you you continue in the my word then you are my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free what brings freedom is the truth Jesus he says to this end I was born and for this cause I came into the world to Bear witness of the truth because it's the truth that makes us free amen religion doesn't make us free a a a United States Constitution doesn't make us free but the truth makes us free amen we're thankful for the Privileges that we have living in the United States we can worship the way we want we can live where we want we've got a lot of freedoms amen but there's so many people that are free in the United States and they're Bound in their soul Bound in their Spirit realm Bound by traditions of men Bound by all kinds of deception Bound by lies and all kinds of traditional teachings of man with no understanding of god with her mind alienated darkened to the things of God Bound by all kinds of addictions Bound by all kinds of habits Bound by all kinds of past issues amen but he said the truth shall make you free I thank God that he's given us the truth so that we can experience real Freedom Jesus came came into this world to Bear witness of the truth I believe that's why we're here to Bear witness of the truth in the message Paradox brother bam says John Came Upon the Earth he was the manifested word of God for that hour we know that he was God's manifested word because why Isaiah said there would be a voice of one crying in the wilderness Malachi the last prophet said behold I send my messenger before my face to prepare the way before the people so what was what what was John uh Jesus says John was a light and you were happy to walk in that light for a season he wasn't the light he was bearing witness of the light he was a lesser light showing the great light he was a light why was he a light amen because he was the word made manifest for his day that's what made him the light and God provide a place of worship he said that what say how do you know he was a prophet the word come to the prophet and he was the manifested word of God for his age so when the word come to the prophet and the prophet declared that word amen he was the manifested word of God for that hour and and Jesus said he was a light amen when God would call the Apostle Paul on the road to Damascus he would call him a chosen vessel and he say he's a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of Israel he was to bear or carry the name of Christ and take it into the darkness of the Gentiles and he was to be a light amen he was actually called to be a light he was going to be the Fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah 49 in in Acts 13 let's turn there together and look at this in Acts 13 He and Barnabas are going along and they're preaching to the Jews as they move around in a missionary journey and the Jews now are going to reject them acts 13: 46 then Paul and Barnabas wax both gold and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing that you put it from you and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn to the Gentiles for so hath the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou should us be for salvation unto the ends of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed and the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region amen when Paul amen when he come Paul and Barnabas come preaching what the truth amen they were there bearing witness of the truth amen and God told go told Paul he was to be a chosen vessel to bear his name before the Gentiles and Kings amen and now he he he comes and he and he says we are a light unto the Gentiles for salvation to the end of the Earth God had told him what is that that's quoting Isaiah 49 Isaiah 49 was now now coming into manifestation in the Apostle Paul it was the word made flesh amen amen and who is the light of the world it's Christ but Christ was working in paulen amen so now he's claiming Isaiah he's claiming God spoke Isaiah 49 over him he's now standing here saying that he's the Fulfillment of Isaiah 49 and Isaiah 49 was to be a light amen coming to the Gentiles amen because the word made manifest for your day is the light of the age and now he's there bearing witness of the truth bringing the light of the age and what happens immediately the Gentiles that were ordained to life amen they came to life why because light brings life amen when there was when was deadness upon this earth when it was under judgment in Genesis 1:2 and darkness covered the face of the deep God first was going to speak a word and that spoken word was that there'll be light because life comes by light and Jesus was the word and in in him was life and that life was the light of men and so now the Apostle Paul is claiming to be a light unto the Gentiles why because he's bearing record of the Life of Christ that's right and it brings them to life let's look at Galatians chapter 1 Galatians 1: 13 Paul says here for you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews religion how that beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God and wasted it and profited in the Jews religion above my mine equals and my own Nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers but when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me we've been through this before but I have to highlight it friends because it's so perfect he didn't say when God finally decided to reveal his son to me of course he revealed the son to him but that wasn't the purpose of his calling he called him so that he could reveal his son in me amen where was the sun revealed in Paul amen where was the light it was shining through Paul Paul was now a carrier of this truth amen he came he was born for a purpose amen he knew that God had separated him from his mother's womb and let him go but when the due season was along that God was going to inject himself into Paul's life amen because he's a chosen vessel unto God chosen before the foundation of the world to do what Amen to Bear record of the truth to shine forth the light amen so that the sun would be revealed in Paul not to Paul and I'm telling you friends the sun has been revealed to us in this day through a prophetic Ministry at the end time but that sun was not just to be revealed to us but in this day the sun is to be revealed in us where is the Sun supposed to be shining where is the light of the world supposed to be it's supposed to be contained in Earth and vessels cuz we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency might be of God and not of man we've been born for a purpose to testify of the truth God told Paul that he as he was getting to the end of his ministry he got arrested and had rejection and and God says don't worry you're going to Bear witness of me in Jerusalem as well what was he doing testifying of the truth you know and and Paul if we just look at the life of Paul he had it pretty good you know he before his conversion I should say BC before conversion Paul BC had it pretty good zealous for the traditions of the fathers come from good stock come from a good family uh his religion was all tucked in nice and in order and he was getting uh accolades and compliments and positions and prestige all because of his religious Duty and service amen but when God who separated him from his mother's wound saw fit to reveal his son in him he he he totally messed up his whole life because he was born for this purpose he wasn't born to propagate the traditions of the fathers he was born to Bear witness of the light and you know when Paul had this massive conversion where he met Jesus Christ in the pillar of fire he spoke to Jesus Christ amen lip to ear he had this uh magnificent uh uh encounter and when he came out of this encounter amen he knew he knew where he went wrong and he knew what was wrong with what he was doing and he instantly knew who Christ was and all of a sudden so much of the scripture started unlocking to Paul that immediately he goes into Damascus and starts in the synagogue amen confounding them teaching from the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ amen why cuz an encounter with the light turns on the light there was a man there that could turn on the light and when the light got switched on for Paul all the sudden those Scrolls that he had read and read and then the school of G sitting at the feet of G he had memorized certain passages and he knew certain things and he had it all misplaced and he had it all in the wrong context and now the things that he was hoping for he was fighting against he was trying to kill amen and keep in darkness the very light that was the Fulfillment of the scriptures that he loved yeah but but then he come in contact with a man that could flip on the light Hallelujah brother Brenham preached the message there's a man here that can turn on the light amen and when you look at that message brother Brenham starts to break it down and type it he says there was a there there's a in the Carl's Bad Caverns you go way down under the ground and down under the Earth there's a little cave in there amen and it's so dark in there there's no light in there amen and and then there was a guide and the guide was going along and and some point in the tour he'd flip off the light and it was so dark you couldn't see your hand in front of your face remember the story amen there's a little a boy and a girl down there a brother and a sister amen and and when they flipped the light off the sister went into hysteric she was frighten she began to scream amen but the little boy knew the guide could turn on the light the little boy knew who was in control of the light and the little boy said Don't Fear little sister there's a man here that can turn on the light and this is the whole basis for brother Ben preaching this message there's a man here that can turn on the light and brother B said I know of another little sister amen our church that's in hysterics cuz it's so dark amen and so you got to look at this whole story playing out here's the little sister in the cabin but the little sister wasn't alone because in the darkness there was an older brother amen there was a brother brandom there was a prophet the older brother to the sister who knew the guy was here who could turn on the light and who was calling to the sister in this Dark Age it was the older brother the prophet of the age saying don't be afraid little church shalom it's good morning there's a man here that can turn on the lightall amen where were they they were in a little room under the Earth down under our Earth there's a little cave called The Soul amen and light hadn't shined on it yet it was dark but there's a guide that's present today and there's an older brother saying don't fear there's a man here that can turn on the light that's what the Apostle Paul met on the road to Damascus he met the man that could turn on the light who was it it was the guide who's the guide the Holy Ghost who is the Holy Ghost it's the life of God it's the life of Jesus Christ and there's a man here that could turn on the light amen and when the man turned on the light all of a sudden Paul could see yeah amen and he runs into Damascus the very place that he was going to go to arrest Christians to Snuff out the light now he goes into the synagogues and preaches to the Jews and confounds them teaching from the scriptures that Jesus was Christ why Paul was born to bear bear witness of the light he was born to bear that name he was born to carry that light he was born to Bear witness of the truth when everything changed for Paul so drastically changed he had met the pillar of fire he had met the same Pillar of Fire that Moses met in a burning bush he had met the same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel out of Egypt and you you would think that all of his old religious buddies would have been happy for him you would have thought the high priest and the elders and and those the students in the school of Gia they would be so thrilled amen that Paul come in contact with the same Pillar of Fire that they believ the same Pillar of Fire that they love the same one that spoke to Moses but no amen now when when the light was flipped on for Paul now Paul's carrying the light now it proves that they hate the light because they're Children of the Darkness amen and what do they immediately try to do they start trying to stop the manifestation of Isaiah 49 amen they don't just let him go on and preach what he wants to preach and do what he wants to do and say it's fine no what immediately what they tried to do is they try to stop this manifested word from Shining Light this has always been the Devil's tactic amen when it was time for a deliverer to be born down in Goan in Egypt amen there was a prophecy laying there and the prophecy was showing that after 400 years God would bring them out with the mighty hand and they knew that God was going to send a deliverer to bring them out and when the time got to approaching near to where this baby needs to be born all of a sudden there was an anointing that struck Pharaoh amen where did that anointing come from on Pharaoh where he decided amen these people are multiplying too much we need to kill them and instead instead of killing all of them they said let's just kill the males let's just destroy the sons of the Hebrews what was that anointing that was the anointing of the devil trying to stop the manifestation of the promised word that's what he's always tried to do that's what he tried to do with with Eve that's what he tried to do in The Exodus Journey that's what he tried to do down in Bethlehem when Herod sent his soldiers down there to destroy all the children to and under what's he trying to do he's trying to stop the manifestation of the world he couldn't stop the word it was already spoken when Herod gathered the the scribes and the priests gather them together and say where will this child be born they knew they had the word they knew in Bethlehem they knew the prophecy he couldn't stop that so what was he trying to stop because he couldn't stop the word he tried to stop the manifestation of the word because it's the manifestation of the word that brings life oh yes that's what the devil hates as long as we can keep it in Pro prophetic word and keep it away from manifested word the devil can deal with that he's been dealing with it for years he brings confusion and different interpretation different ideas and he as long as he can he can't stop it from going forth It's Already Gone forth so he he he tries to just hold it here just don't let that prophesied word move into manifested word because that's dangerous for the devil on Amen Herod felt secure until the prophecy come into manifestation then his insecurity begin to show and the message Shalom the prophet said our heavenly father we now bring to you every hand that's up everywhere and let the Holy Ghost of God bring to them the rhythm of the word and its truth that they are to be molded now to Sons and Daughters of God and they are to be the reflecting of the light of God upon the Earth they are to be the manifested word oh I'm going to say something in just a minute there to be the reflecting of the light of God upon the Earth what are we supposed to be whatever Paul was we're supposed to be they are to be the reflecting of the light of God upon the Earth they are to be the manifested word that men and women are to live the way Jesus lived and to believe every word of God and live by it like he did this this what what I'm I'm dealing with and what I what I'm laboring in and what's in my heart we we cannot just be message believers and do any damage to the kingdom of Satan we cannot just be Believers of a truth and Believers of a word and Believers of a prophecy I mean we must be Believers don't get me wrong but if we stop at just believing or identifying that this is truth I know this this this and Truth amen the the believing has to move into manifestation and instead of I I I don't want to say anything wrong I'm so afraid that I'm always going to be Mook but you all know me by now so don't mistake me right we we've got to move from being message Believers to being the message because the prophet came to forun something and he come come to forrun a manifestation he came to forerun a declaration a happening upon the Earth amen and that what he came to for run was the coming of of the Lord and he came as an eleazer to unite The Head and the body the bridegroom and the bride amen and he did his work he United together and now that was the premise of the message amen was the bride coming of Christ but that can't just be something we talk about that can't be something we just believe in but that has to translate into a life it has to come to life and it has to become light because brother brandham said when when God said let there be light amen that was the word it was the spoken word of God and in that spoken word of God was the power to produce itself he said but you could question the word you could talk about it you could discuss it amen but and it didn't bring any seeds to life when he said let there be light amen potentially it was all there it was all in the power of God's word amen but it had to forego a transformation from spoken word to manifested word and when it manifested word it was light and that light brought life to those seeds amen we can talk yes but talk is cheap we can claim we believe things but when the Press really comes on what do we really believe it has to move from it has to move from word to manifested word let's look back again in John John 15 let's just spend a little bit time in this we had the the spoken word of God and the prophecies in the Old Testament about the seed that would come the son that would be born we had all those prophecies but really what started trouble was when the prophecy moved into manifestation that really started a whole load of trouble if you think about it listen if we just stop and think how many babies died in Bethlehem how many mothers cried h i mean think think of all the trouble that came because the word came into the manifestation and the devil wanted to stop that manifestation I I I'll go out on a limb I'm going to go out on a big limb but here we are in 2023 getting ready to move into 2024 and the devil is still trying to stop the manifestation of the sons of God and you think that abortion being legalized in America was just no he's trying to stop you and I from coming forward every tactic every not just abortion but but all the things that have flooded the Earth all the things that have flooded your mind all the things that have happened in your past all the troubles that have come what do you think the devil's afraid of he's afraid of the manifestation of this promised word amen amen let's look at John 15: 26 but when the comforter has come whom I will send un you from the father even the spirit of Truth what did Jesus come why was he born for this reason I came to the Earth to Bear record of the truth to Bear witness of the truth amen now what is the spirit going to come to do amen the spirit the comforter the spirit the Holy Ghost amen is the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and ye also shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning amen what is the what is the Holy Ghost he is the spirit of Truth what's he coming to do bear witness of the truth what were the disciples to do bear witness of the truth what are we here to do Under the new birth under the baptism of Holy Ghost with the spirit of Truth we are here to Bear witness of the truth We are following in Christ's line that's why Jesus said in Acts when he was speaking to the disciples after his resurrection before his Ascension he said you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the uttermost part of the earth you know he didn't say you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come on you and you'll have gifts and Sensations and that'll be really exciting and a real blessing for you right you understand no because the spirit of Truth has come because you're now going to be the witness you're going to be the light on the earth you're going to Bear record of the truth you have come to come into manifestation amen and now the Holy Ghost come to empower you to be Witnesses amen and in the message God's provided place of worship he says now we find that in each age when God said a certain thing thing would happen here come that man along and manifest that and and I'm going to read this again cuz I want you to stay with me because the wording here is amazing he said when we find that in each age now let's talk about our age when God set a certain thing would happen here come that man along and manifested that so are we all up to date God said a certain thing would happen amen and he prophesied it in Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 and Revelation 10 7even and here come that man which was brother brandham and he manifest that so we're all on the same page the next thing he says here come their people their people what people the people that went along with these men who begin to manifest the word but the seven Church age Messengers they had their people right Moses had his people amen David had his people every time God prophesies something would come when it would come there come the man that would manifest that and then their people came amen are we on the same page all right so and here come their people along and live that amen so what are you and I here to do we're to live that message that Prophet preached amen not just he says what is the token not just coming together and talking about the message but getting under it what is the token the very life of the message coming into me to what to live out the life of the word what I I am one of those people amen I'm not ashamed to say I'm one of those people I'm not a wesleyian amen I'm not a Lutheran amen but I'm a message believer of the end time message God sent a prophet according to the prophecies in the word of God according to Malachi 4 in Luke 17:30 God sent a man to fulfill that amen and there's people that follow that message and I'm one of those people and when he said their people I am their people their is included because T he e i there I am are do you find yourself in that statement now there people came and lived it I'm not just here to play a tape right right and then to keep walking in the earth as I am and to play another tape and say oh that's good word and read another message and come to another service say boy that's a good word that's exciting did you see how I connected that scripture and that scripture I never seen that before and you know friends that's amazing and that's wonderful and we should all get excited we all do get excited every True Believer gets excited about that but it's got to move from the enthusiasm of seeing a fulfillment of the word and now we've got to take that word and be the Fulfillment of that word when he instructs us on how to live we live it amen when he tells us how to honor God we do that to honor God when he tells us what's right and what's wrong amen their people take that word and live it amen and so I'm going to read it again now that we understand what's being said he says we find in each age when God said a certain thing would happen here come that man along and manifested that here come their people along and live that that's what I want to be I want to be one of their people that live that I want to be Associated and attached to this word that came and not just say I have a mental agreement with it I think it's all right but I want to manifest my faith in that word by living it I want to live the message he said then look at the next statement after he says this that was God himself living in the people because it was an answering of his word praise be to God when their people take that word amen that was manifest and preached through those men when their people take it and live it that's God himself being manifest in the people why because it's the word and God is the word and when the word's made manifest amen it's manifesting God praise God 2 Corinthians chapter 3 let's turn here together you know Christmas is wonderful Easter is wonderful all of these things that we celebrate are wonderful but if there's not a birth in me what's the point of my worship and celebration Easter's wonderful but if there's not a resurrection in me I'm just just celebrating a religious ceremony I'm going to church and putting on a nice suit and I'm going to eat a Christmas turkey or a ham or whatever we we do and I'm just going to go through the religious Motions like so many others no it's Easter's got to be brought up today let's call him out of History amen that was Easter what a resurrection that was now let's go to the next statement what a resurrection this is what a birth of the word that was what a birth of the word this is that was the birth birth of the word the fullness of the word comeing to birth amen but the word has come back and being born in Sons and Daughters of God by the new birth Amen Let the birth be in me now let there be a Christmas in my heart second Corinthians chap 3:2 Paul says ye are our Epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men brother BR refers to this so many times about being written Epistles he says for as much as you are manifested ly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart you're the Epistle of Christ when we read you know when we say turn to 1 Corinthians 2 Corinthians or first thess those are the Epistles right so when we when we turn to Ephesians that's theist to Paul what's epistle it's a letter it's a letter he wrote to the Ephesians when you the Epistle of 1 and 2 Corinthians the Epistle of 1 and second thessal those are Epistles and those Epistles were written amen by Paul and by Peter and by various ones but there's an epistle that's written of Christ amen that's what he says let's let's look at it again for as much as you are man manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of your heart where Christ himself has come and written this epistle in it was ministered by Paul but it was Christ writing the word in your heart and now you're to be a written epistle read of all men now men are going to read what are they going to read they can't open up your heart and see what the spirit described they're reading your life and in reading your life they're reading the epistle that Christ wrote on the inside how will Men read this epistle that Christ wrote in me they will read it by my conduct my actions amen the way that I conduct and live my life is a epistle written the question is is it the writing of Christ that was written in the fleshly tables of my heart or is it some other writing that I'm declaring to the world Amen in Matthew 5 let's turn there together Matthew 5 and verse 14 Matthew 5:14 says ye are the light of the world Jesus said I'm the light of the world but now he's looking at his disciples you're the light of the world what makes them the light of the world when they are the word made manifest F they are the light of the world what's that mean when they're living the word for their day they're the light of the world am he said ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven what is he talking about what kind of light it's a life lived before that's it the light lived before men that is your light brother bam said in the message turn on the light no life can come outside of light light produces light produces life there can be no life outside of light natural or spiritual there must be and only light can come by the word of God God's word is a light when it's manifested so life only comes by light brother man said life comes by light and God's word is light when it's manifested so what purpose were we born for why were we born again why are we here to manifest the light because light brings life this world is steeped in darkness but we're here to manifest the word amen we've been given the word to manifest the word we've not been given the word to keep it in a pocket we've not been given the word just to keep it in our mind we've been given the word to live and when that word by the spirit of God is Manifest fleshed out in our life it is the light of the age and light brings life Paul became the light to the Gentiles his old friends didn't like it and anymore his old buddies in seminary the high priest and the elders they didn't like it anymore so what did they tried to do they tried to stop him from manifesting light we're going to get down to the to the challenge of the day the challenge of the day is for us to manifest the light but the devil hates the manifested word that's what he's fighting he's fighting us amen he's fighting us to what to not manifest the word brother B made a couple statements here that and then I want to get into another thought in the trial he said Lord we believe this to be the last commission to the church we believe that the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we believe that any man is no better than his word therefore we believed that the word is you and we believe that it is you which the same yesterday today and forever come today oh father God in the form of the word to us and let the people see that thou art the Risen Christ and raised in this last day in the form that you said you would be in the manifested word is he raised in the last day yes in what form in the form of the manifested word then he says he said in the message things that are to be he said what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour what is she she is the manifested word for today which if she's the manifested word then she is to be the light of the world and this generation and light brings life amen but you know those in darkness hate the light Satan hates the light there was a quote that brother Ron read last Sunday and I was meditating on it as he was reading it there I've been thinking about it all week and I'm going to go I'm going to read it again in Revelation CH 4 verse three says nowadays there we we we don't believe in saying Hell in the Pulpit or Mercy or so blah we need men of God who won't hold back now everybody can't be a preacher but you got a voice and if you can't preach the people a sermon if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of God that will bring reproach to them who reject it why because it'll be the word made manifest in our lives our Holiness our conduct our our reverence to God all of these things that are manifest in our life amen it's it's a sermon that's lived amen and it's an epistle that's read of all men he said now he says uh he said oh my goodness I've lost my space anyways he said if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of God that will bring reproach to them who reject it they say no one could put a finger on his or her life they're sweet living if there ever was a man of God it's that man or woman or that woman see live your sermons don't try to preach them if you're not called to be a preacher you'll get all mixed up up anyhow and messed up and you'll get people tangled up and you know he said you'll ruin them and yourself too just live your sermon the preacher is called to preaches and to live it too so nobody gets out of living it even if you're a preacher you're called to live it too not just stand and Proclaim it amen if you Proclaim it and have no life stop proclaiming it until you have the life that you're proclaiming from amen and live it too if you can't live it then you stop preaching it but you but you're supposed to live your sermons all right right here was voices Oh how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's the Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil why because that's the word made manifest that's what he's been fighting from Genesis all the way down through he can't fight the spoken word he's fighting the manifested word he's trying to prevent it pervert it God hold it down discredit it darken it give it an ugly name he's trying anything he can to get the people people away from the manifested word cuz the manifested word is the light that'll bring life he said he said now he goes on he says well you say if I could preach like Billy gramar or Roberts or somebody a great influential speaker oh no sometimes the devil just laughs at that he don't pay no more attention to that to nothing you get all the theology you want to and all the Seminary training and devil just sit back and laugh at it but but when he sees that life what causes him to tremble that life what causes him to back up that life what what what what's he trying to shut down that life amen and if that's the Thunder that shakes the devil if that's the thing that hurts the devil if that's the voice of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness amen then where is the Battleground today amen you can say the Battleground is is over amen I don't even know what we would say what the world would say where the Battleground is over truth but I'll tell you where the Battleground is the Battleground is right in your life the devil trying to stop you from manifesting the word that's where the fight is taking place because that's what he wants to stop amen he's tried to discredit the message amen he's tried to prove by by by proofs and evidences that brother Brenham was wrong and he he may continue to try that attack amen the problem that he's having is no matter what discrepancies he shows there's a life being manifested that message was the truth the Apostle Paul says you are our Epistles amen you are the letter you are the evidence read of all men amen you were ministered by us but written by Christ in your heart amen and the same exact thing is true today amen the evidence of the message is not amen the testimonies that we can piece together and it's not our understand no the evidence of the message amen is the message was calling forth for Christ to come in the formation of the Bride that there would be a people on the earth that would manifest the very life of Jesus Christ that's the evidence that the message is true that's the Battleground that's the fight that's where the devil's fighting amen we tried to defend the message and say no there was 16 men on the bridge no there's a testimony that men fell on the bridge how many they didn't count them just a bunch of men and the Andy listen forget that argument you're never going to prove anything by trying to prove details and testimonies forget all that if you want to prove the message then you take that message in your heart surrender your life to Christ and say God transform that word into my life and that's the epistle that's read of all men that's the testimony that this message is the truth it's the word made manifest in our lives that's the fight friends yeah that's where the battle is right there trying to get you amen quiet trying to get you discredited trying to get you cold and indifferent trying to keep you from being RedHot on fire sold out absolutely consecrated and dedicated to this message that's the battle that's why Leo deia is trying to creep in constantly that's why entertainments are always moving in that's why disappointment and discouragement is piling on top of you he's trying to stop the manifestation of the word in your life that's the battle and when we don't recognize the battle amen we start falling into all kinds of trap s you know brother B said in spoken words The Original Seed he said Jesus was born to destroy the works of the devil that's what he was born for to destroy the works of the devil he said his body is to do the same so what were you born for to destroy the works of the devil how are you going to destroy the works of the devil well let's back up to the th that shakes the devil let's go to the thing that actually hurts the devil it's that consecrated sweet humble life sold out and dedicated to God Amen I say many times I've said before I said it I think Wednesday our struggle may not be poverty our struggle may not be religious persecution our struggle is soft living right right right amen and we all struggle with it right but I want to be aware of the devil in all of his tactics brother says in the message there's a man here that can turn on the light said life is only by the word of God made manifest I I just love that he says this over and over and over again life is only by the word of God made manif EST the word has to live the word has to become light life comes only by the word of God made manifest as long as it's in just in the book like this it's still can to be questioned but when it's made manifest then you see the product of what he spoke of being manifested then that is light on the word that's what brings the word said so and then when it comes to pass that is life in life light bringing Life Light brings life what light when the word takes on flesh and my flesh and begins to manifest the message of the hour begins to live the word amen that brings a light and that light can bring life that's what the devil doesn't want he doesn't want your light to bring life to another seed yeah amen right remember when when remember when Gabriel came to Mary and Mary was told amen that she was going to now bear Christ she was going to be the Fulfillment of Isaiah chapter 7 amen and that was a hard thing for a little virgin girl from nowhere a nobody from nowhere to absorb and to believe that that you remember the prophecy you heard in Isaiah 7 a virgin shall conceive yeah I've heard it all my life it was a Sunday School uh uh memory verse that I I got a star on my chart from remembering and Gabriel says that's you you're that scripture Isaiah was talking about you God had you in mind before the found I mean that may not be the dialogue that took place but that was the point of the conversation and now this little girl she had to come to terms with the fact that she was the word yeah Amen in her flesh is going to be the manifestation of that word that word was speaking about her she is the manifestation that word is going to come to light and bear light in her flesh and you know what because she's a seed of God she believed it amen she had some questions she had some concerns but after talking to the uh Angel amen the angel told her you're it and she believed it she received it you know what she became she became the light of her hour is that right she was the word made manifest she was light and that light can bring life and now she finds out she's got a cousin and that cousin also has a word inside of her amen a predestinated word in her because there's there's a prophecy in Malachi 3 there's a prophecy in Isaiah of one that will prepare the way of the Lord that make straight his path there's a word now that word is laying in Elizabeth we're on the same page now her cousin Elizabeth has the word in her now Mary has the word in her that's been quickened to life the problem is Elizabeth has not felt the quickening power yet this word is laying there dead in her womb that's right the word is in her but the word has no life it's dead brother man said she never felt the baby kick yet it was dead it was 6 months she was starting to get concerned I love the word of God no doubt she had prayed God I don't feel anything you promised in your word amen your your angel said to Zachariah amen we we know that this is the the the one that's coming and I don't feel anything there's no change in my life I it feels dead like it's not alive amen and and she could pray she could ask Zechariah to pray they may even fast and pray amen but what is it going to take it's going to take that little virgin girl with the word awake inside of her the manifested word for her day when she comes in contact with Elizabeth and she begins to declare the message that she received that this I'm blessed of the Lord I'm going to have a baby his name is Jesus and when she heard that word that had come to life and and and and Mary the word in Mary that was alive brought the word laying dormant in Elizabeth and it sprung to life life came to life word came to word manifested word came to promis word and it sprung to life in her womb and started leaping and jumping around you think your testimony doesn't do anything it's your testimony that brings lies amen you're not just here to take up space you're not just here to breathe oxygen in and out you're not just here to to retire and have a retirement you're here to testify of the truth that's why we are born we have been born and we've come into this life to testify of the truth so that the truth in us being manifest can bring a seed that's laying dormant somewhere else to life let it be Christmas all over again this is why the distractions of the world are so wicked yeah right the prophet of God would come and warn us away from entertainment he would warn us away from religion he would warn us away from all the trappings of the world he wasn't trying to bring us into legalism he wasn't trying to make us amen into some monks or some nuns what he was trying to do is break away all the little suckers that suck the life away all the little distractions that distract us away from what our purpose and intent really is amen and anytime somebody comes down and starts preaching about watching movies and going to these places and running around in entertainment we start to say legalism it isn't legalism those things are driving you away from the very purpose that you're here amen spending hours searching the web all this time bringing nonsense into our minds amen we've got to find out why am I here what is the devil trying to do he's trying to stop the manifestation in my life because the light in me can bring life bring life to a coworker bring life to a family remember it can bring life I believe I'm here I believe with all my heart that I'm here to Bear witness of the truth I'm here to be a written epistle read of all men am that's why I'm here but you know what the devil doesn't want he doesn't want a manifestation in my life he'll bring if he can't do it with pleasure he'll he'll do it with disappointment how many of you been disappointed rejected had situations you shouldn't have had with family members had difficult situation with other members in the church how many You' had things that discourage you tie you up lock you up shut you down and me what's the devil trying to do he's trying to stop you from manifesting the word using trivial little petty things and dis appointments and and and and this person said this and this person did this oh my we got to rise above these things we've got a work to do we've got a calling we've got to shed the light and the devil's trying to choke it down amen remember the seed that was sewn it fell into different types of soil but one of them it fell into where Thorns sprung up and Briars and what did it do it choked out the life amen the devil's trying to use the circumstances in this life to choke out the life because he doesn't want that life to manifest we we get tied up in all kinds of things amen and and some of those things are absolutely unavoidable they happen but I've been praying myself God help me not to lose my joy help me not to lose my vision when things go sideways God help me not to forget my purpose in this planet right brother amen I want to be like Mary I want to say the words come to life inside of me this is the message I've heard this is who I am the word is now alive in me and when I give that word I want the word that's laying dormant in another child of God Amen to Spring to life I want to Bear witness of the truth oh praise be to God let's all stand together I just want to share one more quote two more musicians if you'll please come brother man said there is something about it that whenever you make up your mind that you're going to see him there isn't nothing going to stop you but remember when you make up your mind then the devil is going to do everything he can to stop you he's determined that you're not going to understand it you're not going to see it he'll throw every black sheet across he can to keep you from seeing it what is he trying to stop he's trying to stop the manifestation of the word in your life and things that are to be he says the gene of your life spiritual life was in God the Father before there was even a molecule and you're nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a Son of God now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age you are expressing God's light life in you because you are a son or daughter of God therefore you get what I mean see you are now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate God has coming to you to light up this age this age is steeped in darkness but there's still a light the church world's gone into absolute apostasy but there's still a light and Lord help me not to let that light get darkened because of the circumstances I find myself in because of getting distracted by troubles or getting distracted by Pleasures or getting derailed by circumstances or getting overwhelmed God help me not to lose sight of my purpose amen Jesus always knew what his purpose was when he was 12 years old amen he told Mary and Joseph I must be about my father's business he had a Clear Vision of why he was on the earth amen and by the message of the hour we have a Clear Vision why we're on this Earth and help me God not to stay away from all the devices of the devil that's trying to obscure my vision and stop me from manifesting this life because this is the testimony your life my life is the testimony that this message is the truth yes revelation 22 217 very end of the Bible when we get to the very last last few verses says in the spirit and the bride say come that's the day we live in friends that's our calling we are here to Bear witness of the light and just as Herod sent out his his army to try to kill that manifestation before it could take off the devil has sent his army after you and I to try to kill the manifestation tried to kill it in church problems tried to kill it in personal problems tried to kill it in family problems and tried to distract with prosperity tried to Blind with shiny things he tries distraction techniques and trouble techniques and and and persecu he tries all kinds of techniques yes but I've got notice for the devil he can't stop this manifestation because this is the promised word of God and it will come into manifest a I just say God help me to yield like I've never yielded before help me to surrender like I've never surrendered before help me to stand before Pilate and all the pilots of the world and say for this reason I came into this world for this cause I was born that I should bear witness of the truth and this message is the truth and I'm not just talking about it but I want to live it with all that's in me May the manifested word in me bring life to another word seed laying in the womb of a brother or sister you see how important it is that we live this message not just talk about it live it Proclaim it speak of it speak of it not just with words but speak of it with a demonstration in our life let's not be afraid to pray for the sick let's not be afraid to talk to our neighbors let's not be afraid to take the position and Authority God gave us let's not be afraid to step out on the limb and talk to somebody about Divine Healing and tell them that if you can believe brother Brenham said if the angel said if you can get them to believe in you nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer hey it might be wrong for me to apply that to myself but I believe it the same way because I'm standing here as a representative of Jesus Christ as part of the Bride of Jesus Christ and if you can get them to believe you amen maybe that your prayers amen will be effective in their life as well don't be afraid to demonstrate the life don't be afraid to live holy live clean and talk about living holy and clean amen don't be afraid to pray for the sick don't be afraid to intercede for the needs and tell them why you're doing it and what you hope they'll get out of it and tell them I hope that when God heals you you'll recognize that there's a living Jesus Christ that's here to heal you amen and he wants more than to heal you he wants to fill you with his life don't be afraid we're here to Shine the Light amen we're not here to be shut up we're not here to be quiet we're not here to play Knife we're just here to manifest that life Paul never wasted an opportunity in every synagogue he went in he'd preach Jesus some accepted some rejected when they stoned him to death he got up and knocked the dust off his britches and went to the next city and continued with the same message help us Lord when we rejected when we're made fun of Amen when we're ridiculed Let's Help Us Lord Jesus just to knock it off knock the dust off and go right back and manifest the same life and talk about the same things and love the same way ye are the light of the world Amen a candle is not put under a bushel basket but it's set on City set on the hill the candle set on a Candlestick to give light to all so let your good works so shine before men that they see your good works and glorify your father that's in heaven amen I want the word to be born in me let's just sing that song we sang it right before we preached it was a tiny simple stable all be and warn hardly the place for a king to be bor it didn't take something special to reveal his mesty so I know if I give him control he'll be born in me let your word be bor in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it start live inside this house of clay and mold me day by day let your word be bor in the manger of my heart outwardly I'm nothing not much to behold hardly the place for his word to unfold but if I just yield my vessel and let let him have his way from Glory onto Glory he'll change me day by day let your word be bore in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it start live inside this house of clay and mold me day by day let your word be bor in the manger of my heart oh you see now why the devil fights you so hard troubles on every hand it's what the Apostle Paul said persecutions on every hand troubles Perils of sea Perils of Brethren Perils of this perils of that we're cast down but we're not defeated amen everything was coming against Apostle Paul to stop him just to stop him he was such a threat to the kingdom of God just to shut him up just to shut him down just to imprison him they put him in prisons and his letters become our Bible he trying to stop that manifestation the devil tries to bring sickness to get you discouraged tries to bring troubles to get you discouraged try and I I I I say God help me to wake up to the tactics of the enemy and say no no devil you're trying to get me quiet you're trying to get me discouraged instead of walking around joyful and enthusiastic about the word you're trying to get me to walk down dragging my feet with my head hung low because that helps nobody amen right amen listen it's the light and life in each of us that's bringing life if you think about it we're all here cuz somebody witnessed to us we're here so somebody bore the light somebody had a difference in them somebody had a different life they spoke different they talked different they saw things different and that did something to you and I that's why we're here amen let's do the same thing for somebody else and not let the devil shut us down and quiet us and discourage us I want this message to be proclaimed from my life not even just from my lips but when I walk I want to walk different the things I look at the things I enjoy the look in my eye the countenance on my face amen the way I conduct myself with my family and public I wanted to draw attention to this word that there's a light on this Earth I don't want to live like the world I want to live like Christ in the world I want to bring a difference to somebody else's life the devil is not going to quit today tomorrow he's not going to roll over and give up he'll try another tactic and another Avenue but what's the attempt he's attempting to stop the manifestation of the word in your life but oh I thank God he's a defeated enemy and I want if there's thousands of voices brother said what we need now is thousands of voices thundering out I want to be one of those thousands of voices if it's the life that hurts the devil amen I may have a little life I may have just a little portion but I want to add my portion to his problems I want to be part of the Thunder that shakes the devil and God bless you all I love you man May Christ be born in you with a purpose yeah with a purpose to manifest the truth with the purpose purpose of being a witness of this life being a purpose of bearing this life so somebody else can come to life oh what a privilege it is to live in a

there waiting to Spring to life a prophesied word prophesied predestinated to live in this day may you use us to bring that seed to life but God we desire to be used of you we know that according to the prophecy in your Bible in the Book of Romans that you will bruise Satan under our feet shortly it'll be you doing the work but you need bodies to use you need vessels on this Earth because you will bruise Satan under our feet God I want to yield my body to be part of that bruising Lord that you can take this vessel and you fill it with your life and help me to be emptied out of everything else that you might in this last day destroy the works of the devil through this vessel I cannot do it in myself I have no power but God you promised to send the power Lord if we would just empty out if we just die your Prophet said the problem is we're not dead enough God help me to be more dead than I've ever been before so I am more of your life living and thundering in this day God shine that
