[19:00] this want to say I forgot to let you all
[19:02] know that brother Benjamin was going to
[19:04] be preaching for brother Jean kadeema I
[19:06] had it my mind for the end of June not
[19:08] the end of May so I I made a mistake
[19:10] there I always like for us to know so
[19:12] that we could be agreeing with him and
[19:14] praying so that was that was my fault
[19:16] I'm going to try to do better amen just
[19:18] pray for me also uh want to let you know
[19:22] that uh the um uh Church age book Bible
[19:24] study for tomorrow night's canceled
[19:26] there was an email that went out for
[19:27] that uh Lord willing will pick it up
[19:29] next Thursday June 6th and continue on
[19:32] every other week rotation from there uh
[19:36] like I said Lord willing just let you
[19:38] know that the funeral for my mom's
[19:40] husband Butch height will be uh this
[19:43] Friday so this Friday we'll be traveling
[19:46] down we'll be going all day we'll be
[19:47] down from early till late and uh I got a
[19:51] call this afternoon from my aunt my
[19:54] father's sister that my my uh Grandma my
[19:59] dad's side and my grandma lamb is um her
[20:04] health is failing and they're not
[20:05] expecting her to live and so they've
[20:07] called in hospice and so we're in a bit
[20:10] of a trying time as a family so we would
[20:12] just appreciate your prayers uh this is
[20:14] uh my my dad's mother and she's been a
[20:18] grandma that I've been very very close
[20:19] to she's a very dear and precious
[20:21] grandmother to me and if you remember
[20:23] maybe a year ago maybe not quite a year
[20:26] ago I asked you to remember in prayer
[20:27] because she had a problem with that was
[20:28] like a stroke and had a lot of
[20:30] complications the Lord completely
[20:32] delivered her from that and she was able
[20:35] to come back in her right mind she had
[20:37] good health she was spunky and pepy once
[20:40] again and we all had a chance to visit
[20:42] with her over the last several months
[20:44] and it's been the grace of God and we've
[20:45] been thankful for that uh about two or
[20:47] three months ago they found that she had
[20:49] cancer and they were going to do an
[20:52] operation uh to remove her kidney
[20:54] because the cancer was in her kidney but
[20:56] they did another scan and before they
[20:58] did the operation and found that it had
[21:00] spread into the abdomen and then uh to
[21:03] the lungs and they did a biopsy and they
[21:04] found that it was a a um a cancer that
[21:08] had M metastasized and had grown and uh
[21:12] she opted herself not to have any
[21:14] treatment and she's ready to go she's
[21:17] lived a good full life and so she's
[21:20] surrendered to the will of God and and
[21:23] so we're just praying that if this is
[21:25] her time that God will just let her go
[21:26] peacefully with no
[21:29] struggle she's been a good grandma to me
[21:32] the best I said before the best a boy
[21:34] could ever have and so I'm just praying
[21:37] that the Lord will undertake for her and
[21:39] let her pass peacefully from this life
[21:41] to the next and that he'll reward her
[21:43] abundantly for what she's done for our
[21:45] family amen God is good amen so we
[21:49] appreciate your prayers for that amen
[21:52] let's all stand
[21:54] together let's turn to the book of
[21:57] Ephesians
[21:58] chapter
[22:00] 1 man I want to let you know also that
[22:03] brother Emanuel saasu will be leaving

[22:24] visitors we know we got a few it seems
[22:27] like uh Arizona has showed up in Lio
[22:30] Ohio this week so there's a couple
[22:32] sisters visiting with sister Mari
[22:35] they're here today and uh they're also

[22:39] praise God it's good to have Arizona
[22:41] here amen just bring us Sunshine not
[22:44] rain right amen God bless you all let's
[22:48] look here at Ephesians chap 1 verse 9
[22:51] while we're
[22:52] standing
[22:54] says having made known unto us the
[22:56] mystery of his will according to to his
[22:58] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[23:01] himself amen God bless you as you take
[23:03] your seats may the Lord bless the word
[23:07] amen I see Cheryl s Martin sister and
[23:10] brother-in-law here God bless you it's
[23:12] good to have you guys here as well amen
[23:14] we have so many visitors sneaking and we
[23:15] have to try to keep up amen uh this is
[23:19] the scripture that we used last
[23:20] Wednesday when I ministered we took the
[23:22] title The Mystery of his will and for
[23:25] tonight I'd like to take the mystery of
[23:27] his will part two I didn't intend to
[23:29] have a part two when I preached part one
[23:31] I thought that was just it it was a
[23:32] standalone message there was some things
[23:34] in my notes that I didn't get to but
[23:36] that's okay that often happens but uh I
[23:39] thought I was done I was off to studying
[23:41] something else and enjoying it but as I
[23:43] was meditating and as I was reading and
[23:45] studying God kept opening it up and
[23:47] bringing me back to the unfinished
[23:49] portion so by the grace of God I pray
[23:51] that he helps us get to that part
[23:53] whatever he wants for tonight so that we
[23:55] can understand the mystery of his will
[23:57] in our lives
[23:59] I'd like to do like we did last time and
[24:00] pick up the context of this back in uh
[24:03] chapter 1 starting in verse three let's
[24:05] go back to verse three and read read
[24:07] through this
[24:08] here blessed be the God and father of
[24:11] our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed
[24:14] us with all spiritual blessings and
[24:15] Heavenly places in Christ according as
[24:18] he had chosen Us in him before the
[24:20] foundation of the world that we should
[24:22] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[24:24] love having predestinated us unto the
[24:27] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[24:30] himself according to the good pleasure
[24:32] of his will this is where it gets really
[24:35] exciting I highlight it every time and I
[24:36] probably will as long as I'm alive and
[24:38] God allows me that he has predestinated
[24:41] us to what to the adoption of children
[24:44] by Jesus Christ to himself according to
[24:47] the good pleasure of his will that does
[24:50] something for me does something down to
[24:52] the root and core of me that it wasn't
[24:54] what I desired it's what he desired it's
[24:56] not my will it's his will and that's why
[24:58] if he can reveal to us the mystery of
[25:00] his will it'll take all our problems
[25:02] away because the mystery of his will was
[25:05] determined before the foundation of the
[25:07] world and in this day he sent a prophet
[25:09] to open up the mystery or the secret of
[25:12] his will his will was not just for me to
[25:14] come and have an ordinance and be a good
[25:16] boy and try to be a Christian and do
[25:18] nice things on the earth it's much
[25:19] deeper than that amen it's gone far
[25:23] beyond you know Christian denominational
[25:25] teaching his will wasn't to have nice
[25:27] people amen who would reflect his word
[25:29] and be nice on no he he wanted his
[25:32] family amen to be expressed himself to
[25:34] be expressed as a family and come to an
[25:37] adoption amen where he could place them
[25:39] as his sons and daughters and position
[25:42] them with power and authority on this
[25:45] Earth that's the mystery of his will
[25:47] that you're not just here Amen to be a
[25:49] nice person you're here Amen to come
[25:52] into adoption Amen to have his signate
[25:54] ring placed on your finger and the
[25:56] checkbook in your hand
[25:59] to be a son and daughter of God on this
[26:02] Earth that's the mystery of his
[26:04] will praise
[26:06] God and he determined that according to
[26:10] the good pleasure of his will amen verse
[26:14] six to the praise of the glory of his
[26:16] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[26:19] in the
[26:20] Beloved I am not trying to get his
[26:23] acceptance he made me accepted in the
[26:26] beloving
[26:28] so
[26:29] thankful in whom we have Redemption
[26:32] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[26:33] sins according to the riches of his
[26:35] grace wherein he hath abounded toward us
[26:38] in all wisdom and Prudence having made
[26:40] known unto us the mystery of his will
[26:43] according to his good pleasure which he
[26:45] hath purposed in himself that in the
[26:48] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[26:50] might gather together in one all things
[26:52] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[26:55] which are on earth even in him in whom
[26:58] also we have obtained an inheritance
[27:00] being predestinated according to the
[27:03] purpose of him who worketh all things
[27:05] after the counil of his own will who's
[27:08] working it out he
[27:11] is that we should be to the praise of
[27:13] his glory who first trusted in Christ
[27:17] amen so so as we look at this we're just
[27:19] doing this just a quick review I'm going
[27:21] over this scripture and a couple uh uh
[27:24] quotes and then we'll launch into this
[27:26] other thought that I have for today
[27:29] as we look into the adoption I I read
[27:31] this quote last time adoption part three
[27:33] from
[27:34] 1960 he he quotes this scripture that we
[27:36] just read in verse 9 he said having made
[27:39] known to us the mystery of his will but
[27:40] he injects another thought he said make
[27:43] known to us the mystery of his will to
[27:45] adopt us according to the good pleasure
[27:48] which he has purposed in himself amen
[27:50] you say I'm trying to make it to the
[27:52] adoption amen he's already determined
[27:55] that you're coming to the adoption
[27:57] that's the Hiser of his will to adopt us
[28:01] amen according to the good pleasure
[28:02] which he has purposed in himself he
[28:05] purposed this himself before the
[28:07] foundation of the world how many
[28:09] understands it I said oh God I want to
[28:12] understand it help me to fully
[28:14] understand it so that it can change my
[28:16] life and have an effect every day of my
[28:19] life in the in the message the seed
[28:22] shall POS the and thy seed shall possess
[28:25] the Gate of his enemy he says just like
[28:27] we find in in the Old Testament testing
[28:29] trying and then placing a son adoption
[28:32] placing the son after he's already a son
[28:34] been born into the family he's a son
[28:37] then he would be tested and tried and
[28:39] raised up by tutors and see how he comes
[28:42] out and then he's placed positionally
[28:44] equal almost to his father now listen
[28:48] this is what we've been this is what
[28:49] we've been predestinated
[28:51] unto this process is what we've been
[28:54] predestinated unto we come into the
[28:56] world spiritually BL mind having
[28:58] spiritual Amnesia with our minds
[29:00] darkened alienated from the things of
[29:02] God because we were born wrong so we
[29:04] were born in sin amen so we come with
[29:07] the sin nature and our minds are
[29:08] darkened to these things amen that's why
[29:11] he must begin to reveal to us the
[29:13] mystery of his will because our mind are
[29:15] darkened to the very purpose why we come
[29:17] on this planet so we come and we try to
[29:20] live a life and we're doing whatever we
[29:22] can do amen we're learning by our senses
[29:24] contacting this world gaining knowledge
[29:27] and understanding by the things we touch
[29:28] and feel but none of that amen is is
[29:32] putting us in contact with what God
[29:35] brought us here for that's just our
[29:36] contact on this Earth to live a fleshly
[29:38] life amen but he sent a message in this
[29:41] day amen he sent his word to us to bring
[29:44] us back in contact with the mystery of
[29:46] his will so that we would know what our
[29:49] purpose is on this
[29:51] planet CU if we don't know what our
[29:53] purpose is we don't know what to do in
[29:54] our lives we don't know what decisions
[29:56] to make because our decision decisions
[29:58] are based on our
[30:01] purpose at least they should
[30:04] be and then that purpose now is when
[30:08] you're awakened and you're born amen
[30:10] when you're born again as a son you're a
[30:13] son you're awakened to the fact that
[30:15] you're a son but now you go into child
[30:17] training now you go into the the the
[30:20] your walk with the tutor which is the
[30:22] Holy Ghost and he tutors you along in
[30:24] the word and he's bringing you through
[30:26] the lessons in life through the tri and
[30:28] tribulations in life and the reason that
[30:30] the mystery of his will is so important
[30:32] to us is because it gives purpose to
[30:34] trials and tribulations cuz if not they
[30:37] just become discouragements to us they
[30:39] become things that that that Whittle
[30:41] away at our at our nerves and they
[30:43] deteriorate our resolve and and before
[30:46] you know it we're all broke down and
[30:47] beat down and crumpled up because we
[30:49] didn't see the purpose in the trials and
[30:52] in the testings we saw a life of of
[30:55] conflict we saw a life of affliction and
[30:58] we begin to feel sorry for ourselves
[31:00] because I've went through this trouble
[31:02] and I've went through that trouble and
[31:04] self-pity comes in and the devil want
[31:06] you to feel sorry for yourself because
[31:09] he doesn't want you to understand the
[31:10] purpose of the trial and if you feel
[31:12] sorry for yourself you've missed the
[31:14] purpose the very fact that we could feel
[31:17] sorry for ourselves because we went
[31:19] through hard times means that we're
[31:21] still stuck in an Earthly realm we're
[31:24] still stuck in a human spirit that we
[31:26] need the spiritual amnes you to break
[31:28] away amen we need the darkness that's
[31:30] we're under to break away so that we can
[31:32] see this trial's never here to hurt me
[31:35] this trial's here to promote me because
[31:37] he's moving me to
[31:39] adoption so the Holy Ghost is there and
[31:42] listen not every not every lesson was a
[31:46] pass it wasn't like the tutor come
[31:49] through and it was 100% 100% 100% 100%
[31:53] 100% go to
[31:56] adoption not even the
[31:58] point the point of the tri and listen I
[32:02] I'm not I'm not worried about showing up
[32:04] in heaven with a perfect scorecard you
[32:06] know my this here's here's my report you
[32:09] know a a a a no listen there's a whole
[32:13] bunch of FS you know f f f f f and then
[32:17] he says well go back and try it again
[32:19] amen you're not disqualified from being
[32:21] a son amen but you got to go back
[32:23] because you got to learn this to be able
[32:26] to handle the power that's going to be
[32:28] placed in your
[32:29] hand so there's no it's not like the
[32:32] modern school system there's no moving
[32:33] them along amen the Holy Ghost doesn't
[32:35] just move you along amen you've got to
[32:37] learn the
[32:39] lesson amen so then if we don't
[32:42] understand the purpose of our life the
[32:44] purpose of the trials they become
[32:46] meaningless and our life becomes aimless
[32:48] and then all of a sudden everything
[32:50] becomes a
[32:52] discouragement amen and that's life for
[32:55] all of us we get discouraged things pile
[32:57] up they come in hot and heavy sometimes
[33:00] and you get beat down you get tired you
[33:02] get discouraged but none of it is for
[33:05] Destruction not one of it is to destroy
[33:08] us but it is to try us it is to test us
[33:13] with the intention listen I'm going to
[33:15] say it and just hang on fasten your seat
[33:17] belts with the intention that you will
[33:20] fail some of them
[33:25] yes the test in Eden was meant to be
[33:32] failed did it serve God's
[33:34] purpose God couldn't make them fail he
[33:37] put them on free m they failed on their
[33:38] own but the intention was to put them in
[33:41] a situation where they were likely to
[33:43] fail knowing that they would
[33:45] fall do you think you've ever been put
[33:47] in a situation do you think God would do
[33:50] a thing like that why would God do
[33:52] something like that only if he wants to
[33:54] reveal himself to you as a deliverer and
[33:56] a savior and a God who forgives and a
[33:58] God who heals wounds and amen maybe God
[34:01] will put you in the circumstances
[34:03] knowing you're likely to fall and we say
[34:05] God why would you do that it hurt me so
[34:07] bad it caused me so much grief and so
[34:09] much trouble amen because he's the one
[34:12] amen who's got the bomm of Gilead he's
[34:14] the deliverer he's going to bring
[34:16] something out of the word to life that
[34:18] you would only understand if you had
[34:21] failed in that
[34:23] test anden that's the reason like like
[34:26] nobody wants to hang out with somebody
[34:28] who got everything
[34:29] right I don't even want you to be my
[34:33] friend you had a perfect score through
[34:35] life you never messed anything up you
[34:37] had no failure you didn't do anything
[34:39] wrong listen I don't want to hear it I
[34:41] just don't want to hear
[34:48] it amen I mean you can keep talking but
[34:52] my mind's probably somewhere
[34:55] else because the reality is that wasn't
[34:58] the point right the point of the test in
[35:00] the trial was not the perfect Mark the
[35:03] point of the test in the trial is
[35:05] because he wants to put you in position
[35:09] almost equal to the
[35:12] father and he cannot put people born the
[35:15] way we were born in that position to
[35:18] handle the spoken word unless there's a
[35:21] character there that can handle that
[35:22] when the time
[35:24] comes it's irresponsible for him to do
[35:28] so as irresponsible it is for a man to
[35:31] turn over the family farm and the family
[35:33] business to a son who's spoiled and
[35:35] selfish and has no vision and no
[35:37] self-discipline that would be
[35:39] irresponsible to handle all the assets
[35:41] and all the wealth of the family over to
[35:43] a son like that that would be
[35:45] foolishness amen the same way it would
[35:47] be irresponsible for God to hand over
[35:49] the authority and power and the power of
[35:52] the word that he's putting into the
[35:54] bride and putting into her hands in the
[35:55] end time unless a me she had the
[35:58] character to be able to handle that
[36:00] without destroying herself or
[36:03] others so the point now is to come to
[36:06] the adoption and so the the position is
[36:09] so important it requires the trials and
[36:12] the
[36:13] testings that's why I think I'm so
[36:15] thankful for a
[36:18] prophet I I can't ever thank God enough
[36:21] that he came and opened his word in this
[36:24] day there's no way for us to know these
[36:27] things friends I mean we could take some
[36:29] shots in the dark and there's some Godly
[36:31] men who've been able to study the word
[36:33] and under the anointing of the Holy
[36:34] Ghost with gifts and their life they've
[36:36] picked pieces of this out and they've
[36:38] had some of this amen with even through
[36:40] the church ages they've had some of this
[36:42] understanding amen the problem was it
[36:44] was fragmented across the church ages
[36:45] and fragmented across groups amen but it
[36:48] would it took a prophet in this day to
[36:50] pull all the fragments all those truths
[36:52] together to make one picture so we could
[36:55] see the picture of the will of God
[36:57] clearly
[36:59] and I'm so thankful for
[37:01] that
[37:05] Amen in adoption part four brother B
[37:08] says the mystery of his will and
[37:10] remember how we hung on that how many
[37:12] was here this morning he's referring to
[37:14] what we just read out of part three
[37:16] let's see how we stuck on that the
[37:18] mystery of his will now it's not just a
[37:19] little thing then it's a mystery God's
[37:22] will is a
[37:23] mystery so God's will is a mystery
[37:26] mystery means something that's hidden
[37:27] hidden or secret so God's will is a
[37:30] mystery and each man has to seek out the
[37:33] will of God for his or herself God's
[37:36] mystery that's what we labored on last
[37:39] time is knowing that who I am in Christ
[37:42] because that's his mystery that's his
[37:44] secret of his will concerning me and
[37:47] that'll change my life amen that'll
[37:49] change the way I live my life once I
[37:51] catch that Revelation now let's go to
[37:53] Romans
[37:55] 8 and we read this scripture last time
[37:57] and we're going to read it again and
[37:59] place it in here at the
[38:01] beginning Romans
[38:06] 8 Romans
[38:09] 828 and we know that all things work
[38:12] together for good to them that love God
[38:13] to them who are the called according to
[38:15] his purpose for whom he did for know he
[38:18] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[38:21] the image of his son that he might be
[38:23] the firstborn among many Brethren so
[38:28] now he was that was the first born among
[38:31] many Brethren and the first one to come
[38:32] to adoption but but those whom he fornew
[38:36] that's his elect seed Those whom he
[38:38] forew he did predestinate to be
[38:41] conformed to the image of his son so we
[38:44] are predestinated unto the adoption of
[38:46] children by Jesus Christ according to
[38:49] the the the the uh good to the pleasure
[38:52] of his will the good pleasure of his
[38:54] will but that predestination is also to
[38:57] be conformed into the image of his son
[38:59] because when we come to adoption we'll
[39:01] be looking just like Jesus
[39:03] Christ
[39:05] amen amen and so this is where brother
[39:07] Ben preaches the message stature of a
[39:09] perfect man to be conformed to the image
[39:11] of his son to be to to to move in all
[39:14] things unto the head which is Christ and
[39:16] to the stature of a perfect man unto
[39:18] Christ so we're coming to the very image
[39:21] of Jesus Christ reflected back through a
[39:23] many-membered bride through each one of
[39:25] us so let's go to second Peter chapter
[39:29] 1 and now let's look at this uh
[39:32] scripture that brother brandom used when
[39:34] he went to stature of a perfect
[39:37] man and started talking about the divine
[39:40] nature second Peter chap
[39:46] 1:3 second Peter 1 and3 according as his
[39:50] divine power has given unto us all
[39:52] things that pertain unto life and
[39:53] godliness through the knowledge of him
[39:55] that hath called us to Glory and virtue
[39:58] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[40:00] great and precious promises that by
[40:03] these you might be partakers of the
[40:04] divine nature having escaped the
[40:06] corruption that is in the world through
[40:08] lust so now I can be a partaker of the
[40:11] divine
[40:13] nature not my nature doctored up but the
[40:17] divine nature amen so that I can be a
[40:21] partaker of the divine nature having
[40:24] escaped the corruption that is in the
[40:25] world through lust so I've got to escape
[40:28] corruption that came through lust
[40:30] remember how Eve was
[40:32] deceived through lust so you desired she
[40:35] had to he created desire she had to
[40:37] desire something and she had to desire
[40:39] something and move amen outside of God's
[40:41] boundary he had for her and so that
[40:43] corruption entered the world through
[40:46] lust so we having escaped that we can be
[40:48] partakers of his divine nature and
[40:51] beside this giving all diligence add to
[40:53] your faith virtue and to Virtue
[40:56] knowledge and to knowledge Temperance
[40:58] and to Temperance patience and to
[41:00] patience godliness and the godliness
[41:02] brotherly kindness and brotherly
[41:04] kindness charity for if these things be
[41:07] in you and abound they make you that you
[41:10] should neither be Barren nor unfruitful
[41:12] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[41:13] Christ so now as we look at the divine
[41:16] nature brother Brandon breaks it down
[41:19] into these to these uh seven qualities
[41:22] or seven characteristics with the
[41:24] Capstone of divine love being charity
[41:27] the eight and and he says add to your
[41:30] faith virtue so faith and virtue and
[41:34] knowledge and Temperance so knowledge is
[41:37] Godly knowledge virtue is strength that
[41:39] that the strength that comes from God
[41:42] faith is the faith of God knowledge is
[41:44] God's knowledge Temperance is
[41:46] self-control patience is is
[41:48] longsuffering is being able to wait and
[41:50] endure and to patience godliness and to
[41:54] Godliness brotherly kindness which is
[41:56] brotherly love and to brotherly kindness
[41:58] charity which is perfect
[42:01] love this is the divine
[42:03] nature this is what we're being grown
[42:06] into this is what we're being groomed
[42:09] into this is the goal this is the
[42:13] destination the destination is not so
[42:17] that you can become a a prideful
[42:21] powerful arrogant
[42:24] know-it-all superum being amen you're to
[42:28] be a superum being but superhuman being
[42:30] doesn't necessarily mean a superhero
[42:32] like the world consider superhuman
[42:34] superh human means above
[42:36] human and I want to be superhuman I want
[42:39] to be above human CU human is
[42:44] terrible it's Afflicted with selfishness
[42:47] and pride and arrogancy and bitterness
[42:50] and contempt and strife and and so I
[42:52] want to become superhuman amen not as a
[42:55] self- elevated where where I'm we become
[42:59] this this this overarching all powerful
[43:02] uh menacing superhuman uh uh Marvel
[43:06] comic
[43:07] hero as
[43:09] Christians I don't think that's what
[43:11] he's looking for I don't know I don't
[43:13] think that's what the super race is to
[43:16] be that's not what Jesus was when he was
[43:20] here he was
[43:22] lowly he was Meek he was
[43:25] humble did did he have power yes he had
[43:28] power but that was power under
[43:31] control and he held it down could he
[43:35] have let it out yes but he held it down
[43:38] and he subjected himself to the will of
[43:40] the father and he only did that which
[43:42] the father showed
[43:44] him so what could he have
[43:47] been
[43:50] right the question is what could brother
[43:52] Brenham have been we've talked about
[43:55] this before we all know if he would have
[43:57] just taken that gift and used it any way
[43:59] he wanted and the reality is he he he
[44:02] had a gift amen and that gift could have
[44:04] taken him places and it could have
[44:06] opened doors for him amen but he himself
[44:09] had to learn to hold it
[44:11] down and not use it for himself but use
[44:14] it for the glory of God and Jesus had to
[44:17] learn to hold his gift and his power in
[44:21] and only use it by the will of God for
[44:23] the glory of God according to the word
[44:25] of God and not for his own self-purpose
[44:30] right and so when we come to this quote
[44:34] here there is only one way provided by
[44:36] God for anything this is from July of
[44:39] 1963 he said his word is always the
[44:42] truth always the
[44:44] truth his believing children believe for
[44:47] it and cry for it until his word is
[44:49] Vindicated in his word is always his
[44:52] will I want you to catch this and just
[44:55] think of this his word is always his
[44:57] will so now we're talking about the
[44:59] mystery of his will and we know
[45:02] according to the word the mystery of his
[45:03] will is that he's predestinated us unto
[45:06] adoption of sons that we would that we
[45:08] would be conformed into the image of his
[45:09] son that we would come to the stature of
[45:11] a perfect man and move to adoption we
[45:13] know that that's the mystery of his will
[45:15] for our lives and we need that to become
[45:17] a reality to us amen by Jesus Christ
[45:20] revealing himself personally to
[45:22] us but also the mystery of his will amen
[45:27] is revealed in the revealing of his word
[45:29] because his word is always his will so I
[45:33] want to know the will of God concerning
[45:34] my life first find out if you're part of
[45:37] this bride or not amen and then you know
[45:39] the will then you know you in his mind
[45:41] before the foundation of the world you
[45:42] know you're part amen of the things
[45:44] we've already been talking about but
[45:46] then I want to find his will for my
[45:47] everyday life his will is his word his
[45:50] word is his will so now if I want to
[45:53] find his will I must find the word amen
[45:56] in live and reflect the word and if I
[45:58] live the word I'm living the will of
[46:01] God
[46:03] Amen he says his word is always his will
[46:06] if you want to know what the will of God
[46:08] is find it in the Bible it's God's word
[46:11] now listen anything contrary to it is
[46:16] perverted so God is
[46:19] not God is Not uh predestinated us into
[46:23] the adoption of sons to live a perverted
[46:25] life that's not what we were for
[46:27] ordained to do we weren't foreordained
[46:30] for the perversion we were foreordained
[46:32] to manifest the
[46:33] word so his word is always his will
[46:37] anything contrary to it is
[46:40] perverted he says in second Corinthians
[46:43] 13 you don't have to turn there I'll
[46:44] just quote it real quickly 2 Corinthians
[46:47] 13:7 I'm sorry 138 for we can do nothing
[46:51] against the truth but for the truth the
[46:54] Apostle Paul now is talking and in in
[46:56] brother B just told us that God's word
[46:59] is his will I want to know his will it's
[47:02] his
[47:03] word amen so I know if I'm contrary to
[47:07] the word I'm automatically out of the
[47:08] will of
[47:09] God because if the word's been perverted
[47:12] at all that's not the life he's called
[47:14] me
[47:15] to but but uh Paul says we can do
[47:19] nothing against the truth but for the
[47:22] truth amen this becomes the reality of
[47:25] Our Lives as we move to a adoption that
[47:27] we are not called to do anything against
[47:30] the truth but we are called only for the
[47:33] truth in John 17:17 Jesus said sanctify
[47:37] them through thy truth Thy word is truth
[47:40] so we can do nothing against the truth
[47:42] means we can do nothing against the word
[47:45] but only for the truth or for the word
[47:48] because his word is truth and that word
[47:51] truth in John 17:17 is the word logos
[47:54] we've talked about it many times we all
[47:56] know it but just in review it's the word
[47:58] translated into word uh most often than
[48:01] not in the Bible it's this logos was the
[48:04] word that the Greek word behind the
[48:06] scripture in John 1:1 in the beginning
[48:08] was the word logos and the Word was with
[48:10] God logos and that's the word it's used
[48:13] uh uh 330 times in the New Testament but
[48:16] in the definition of it it says a word
[48:19] uttered by a living voice embodies a
[48:21] concept or idea so now brother brandham
[48:24] brought this definition to us he brought
[48:26] it and he says it's the word that
[48:29] contains the original
[48:31] thought this is a very specific word
[48:34] amen when we talk about word we're not
[48:36] just talking about amen the the what's
[48:39] written on paper because what's written
[48:41] on paper can be read and taken anywhere
[48:44] your intellect will take it so your own
[48:47] understanding of what you read and you
[48:49] read a sentence out of the Bible amen
[48:51] you can have four different people from
[48:52] four different walks of life or four
[48:54] different places on the planet they read
[48:56] the the same verse out of the Bible and
[48:59] they come with four different
[49:00] understandings of that and so it means
[49:02] that that they read the words but they
[49:05] didn't necessarily get the word because
[49:08] if they got the word it contains the
[49:10] thought of God with the word that's
[49:13] logos amen and in the beginning was
[49:15] logos not just words on paper amen but
[49:19] the very thought of God that was moving
[49:21] into a manifestation amen that's why
[49:24] word is the thought as it becomes man
[49:26] manifested amen as it begins to take
[49:29] form that is
[49:31] word that's why when brother Alistair
[49:33] was here and he preached on the word he
[49:35] says what did God say what language did
[49:38] God speak in when he said let there be
[49:40] light who was there to hear the word who
[49:42] can tell you was it English was it
[49:44] Hebrew was it this or that or do was
[49:46] there anything audible that we would
[49:48] even consider audible with the ears that
[49:51] we have now when we say spoke or audible
[49:55] amen we we're we're we're thinking from
[49:57] our own perspective down here on Earth
[50:00] as if what the only the only spoken word
[50:03] amen is only something that I can hear
[50:06] with the vibrations that are hitting the
[50:08] drums in my ears amen but there was no
[50:10] drums in any ears when he said let there
[50:14] be and we know that speech sometimes is
[50:18] different than what we consider speech
[50:20] amen what we call speech is speech amen
[50:22] but the the Bible in the Psalms as it
[50:24] describes the heavenlies amen it says
[50:27] they speak a language amen and it goes
[50:29] out all over the their speech is heard
[50:30] by all the world Amen what what speech
[50:33] do the stars give that hits your
[50:38] eardrum amen but they're speaking of the
[50:42] glory of God they're speaking of the
[50:44] handiwork of God Amen their voice utth
[50:47] out the things of God their speech goes
[50:49] to the ends of the
[50:54] world praise God so this word is so much
[50:58] deeper it can be represented on paper it
[51:01] can be represented audibly as what we
[51:04] call audibly it can be represented amen
[51:06] through signs through wonders through
[51:08] through Miracle it can be represented in
[51:10] many ways amen but what it is is the
[51:13] thought of God coming into manifestation
[51:16] that is this
[51:17] word amen and it embodies the concept or
[51:22] idea so this is the this is the thing
[51:24] that becomes so important because if I
[51:27] get the audible part that hits my ear
[51:30] and then I go to act that out in life
[51:32] and the way I act it out is not
[51:34] according to God's thought then I did
[51:36] not get the
[51:37] logos although I got words I got what we
[51:41] would call words I did not get the logos
[51:43] because now my actions are different
[51:46] than God's thinking when he spoke that
[51:48] word or when he had a prophet speak it
[51:50] or when he had men of old put it down
[51:52] and pin it out on a scroll amen whatever
[51:54] was in God's mind am is the word the
[51:58] thought becoming the word the word must
[52:01] contain that thought in order to be
[52:06] logos this is
[52:09] why this is why you can read and you can
[52:12] read and you can read and you can read
[52:14] but without the spirit of Revelation
[52:16] amen we're not going to get any further
[52:17] than the denominations are getting and
[52:20] there's nothing wrong with reading and
[52:21] there's nothing wrong with respecting
[52:22] the word and I believe God will even
[52:24] honor those who do it sincerely amen but
[52:27] we need more than the ability to read we
[52:29] need more than just the great
[52:31] translation of the Bible brother Brenham
[52:32] says so much what we need is the spirit
[52:34] of Revelation to tap us back into the
[52:37] mind of God and God in his Mercy amen he
[52:40] sent down a voice in our day the voice
[52:42] of God Amen that could tap into the back
[52:45] part of God's mind and bring the perfect
[52:47] interpretation of the word with Divine
[52:49] Vindication so that we don't have to
[52:51] question what God meant by this
[52:53] verse you just go back and find what the
[52:56] prophet said because the prophet was the
[52:58] mouthpiece of God he wasn't his own
[53:00] mouthpiece he was the mouthpiece of God
[53:03] and so now this is why in my life I'm
[53:06] not trying as a a as as a Christian
[53:09] who's been predestinated into the
[53:11] adoption of children to be conformed
[53:13] into the image of Christ who is the
[53:15] anointed word amen so I've been
[53:17] predestinated to come into the image of
[53:19] the anointed
[53:21] word amen so that's why I'm not here in
[53:25] this life to contradict the prophet or
[53:27] to correct the prophet or to change what
[53:29] he said or to make it more malleable to
[53:31] my station in life amen because I'm here
[53:34] to get the thought behind the word and
[53:37] how am I going to do it with my own
[53:41] intellect we need a we needed a
[53:45] voice at the end of time we needed the
[53:48] perfect interpretation of the word with
[53:51] Divine vindication
[53:58] amen praise
[54:02] God oh praise the
[54:05] Lord you know I'm just going to inject
[54:09] this this isn't anything I was had on
[54:11] paper or notes or thoughts but you know
[54:14] how brother Alistair come here last
[54:16] weekend and he preached on
[54:19] Dimensions seven dimensions God's in the
[54:21] seven sixth Dimension and and shows the
[54:23] three that we live in the fourth
[54:25] dimension amen being a a dimension of
[54:27] communication of Science and The Fifth
[54:30] Dimension right how many believes that
[54:33] that was the
[54:35] truth now you go prove to me what The
[54:38] Fifth Dimension is by the Bible
[54:44] verse find a Bible verse that explains
[54:47] what The Fifth Dimension
[54:55] is amen I mean don't get me wrong the
[54:59] Bible is everything to us it's the word
[55:01] of God but you realize unless brother
[55:04] Alistair believed that brother benam was
[55:06] right on his teaching and dimensions he
[55:08] could have never came and preached that
[55:10] he could not have preached that message
[55:11] without a prophet unless brother
[55:14] brandham had tapped into the mind of God
[55:16] and understood the mentions and could
[55:18] bring it into our realm and preach the
[55:20] mentions he couldn't you cannot prove
[55:22] what The Fifth Dimension is by the Bible
[55:24] but once you know what the Fifth
[55:25] Dimension is you can see it all through
[55:27] your Bible amen the Bible vindicates the
[55:30] teaching the Bible backs it up and
[55:32] supports it because you find it all over
[55:34] the place amen but you can't come to
[55:36] that conclusion with your intellect and
[55:39] Bible verses alone it takes a prophet
[55:41] Amen to come and bring it to us and he
[55:44] unlocks something out of the word and
[55:46] for us to receive it we have to believe
[55:48] that that is the mouthpiece of God and
[55:51] if we're always questioning that
[55:53] mouthpiece and I have to prove
[55:54] everything he says amen by the Bible or
[55:56] I can't accept it then brother Alistair
[55:58] could not have preached
[56:02] Dimensions amen because what was he
[56:06] doing that was the word of God what made
[56:09] it the word of God because I could find
[56:12] ink blotches that M no what made it the
[56:15] word of God is it was the thought of God
[56:17] being
[56:18] expressed it was the word of God and it
[56:20] matched perfectly with the word that he
[56:22] gave us so that it could be confirmed so
[56:26] you could go to your Bible so that you
[56:28] could see it so you could understand it
[56:29] so that it becomes
[56:31] clear amen don't get me wrong I don't
[56:34] believe in something that's not in the
[56:36] Bible I don't believe something that's
[56:37] just jointed with God's word it's got to
[56:39] be perfectly in Harmony and unity with
[56:41] the word but we have to understand what
[56:43] word really is what the word of the Lord
[56:46] actually is it's the thought of God
[56:48] being
[56:50] expressed praise God yes and that is
[56:54] what we live by yes sir that is what
[56:57] we're supposed to manifest we're
[57:00] supposed to become the Living Word
[57:03] manifested the manifested word and if
[57:05] I'm going to be the manifested word
[57:08] there has to be a continuity a l a
[57:10] linear thought from thought to
[57:13] expression to manifestation that has to
[57:16] be right in harmony with one another so
[57:18] now that the expression in my life is in
[57:21] harmony with the word that was expressed
[57:23] a spoken word and written word amen
[57:25] which is in harmony with the thought of
[57:27] God I can't get any of this disjointed
[57:30] for me to become the word made flesh
[57:32] there has to be a continuity between
[57:35] those
[57:36] three
[57:37] amen and his word is his
[57:42] will amen
[57:45] Amen brother bam says in wisdom versus
[57:48] Fai I'm going to quote many places out
[57:51] of wisdom versus Faith it's a message
[57:52] I've been going through very slowly over
[57:54] the last week or more and I've been
[57:57] enjoying it so much and so I've got
[57:59] quite a few quotes out of there it says
[58:01] in the beginning was the word and the
[58:03] Word was with God and the Word was God
[58:06] the word was in God it was God it was
[58:09] his thoughts that was in him always
[58:12] there so what was the word it was his
[58:15] thoughts that was always there God's
[58:18] thoughts is as Eternal as God is that
[58:21] ain't skim milk brother see here it
[58:23] comes God's thoughts was his word in the
[58:26] beginning that's in eternity now when
[58:28] beginning first started time in the
[58:30] beginning was the word God's thoughts
[58:32] and the Word was with God and the Word
[58:34] was God see listen to this his thoughts
[58:39] is what he
[58:41] was so what was God his
[58:44] thoughts and then as God started to to
[58:48] come into manifestation it says in the
[58:50] beginning was the word the beginning of
[58:53] what the beginning of the thoughts
[58:55] coming into
[58:57] expression was the word and that word
[59:00] took form as a logos and brother benam
[59:02] explained it as a pillar of light or a
[59:04] pillar of fire and in that was all the
[59:07] thought of God contained in there now
[59:09] when when that was the beginning in the
[59:11] beginning was the word now it moves from
[59:13] thought to expression as it's expressed
[59:16] that's word I don't know if there was
[59:18] anything audible that took place then
[59:20] amen but what happened was he
[59:23] spoke what do you mean he spoke he
[59:27] expressed his thought became
[59:30] expressed and God spoke
[59:33] right and it manifest as a pillar of
[59:36] fire amen so his thought is what he was
[59:41] so
[59:42] now as that logos now came down the word
[59:46] the full embodiment of the word or the
[59:47] full thought of God as word now came
[59:50] down and was manifested in one vessel
[59:53] that's Jesus Christ amen that man became
[59:57] the manifested word we on the same page
[1:00:01] so you have uh the the thought God Alone
[1:00:05] the logos the word or the thought being
[1:00:07] expressed Jesus Christ the word made
[1:00:09] flesh is the manifested word we're on
[1:00:12] the same
[1:00:13] page if Jesus now begins to act any way
[1:00:18] different than the thought of God he had
[1:00:19] when he's alone now the manifestation is
[1:00:22] untrue it's wrong it's false word
[1:00:26] amen so the will of God for his life was
[1:00:28] for him to be the perfect reflection of
[1:00:31] the thought of
[1:00:32] God
[1:00:34] Amen and that's what he was but that was
[1:00:37] not to stop with him now that's moving
[1:00:40] down into his
[1:00:42] bride amen let's go to First Peter
[1:00:45] chapter 4 we should be close here at
[1:00:48] second Peter let's go to First Peter
[1:00:56] 1 Peter chapter 4 or sorry 1 Peter
[1:00:59] chapter 1 no I'm I'm wrong 1 Peter
[1:01:02] chapter 4 1 Peter
[1:01:06] 4:1 for as much then as Christ has
[1:01:09] suffered for us in the flesh arm
[1:01:11] yourselves likewise with the same mind
[1:01:13] for that for he that hath suffered In
[1:01:16] the Flesh ha ceased from sin that he no
[1:01:19] longer should live the rest of his time
[1:01:21] in the flesh to the lust of men but to
[1:01:23] the will of God so this is is God's
[1:01:26] purpose amen that you no longer live the
[1:01:29] rest of your life uh uh Time In the
[1:01:32] Flesh to the lust of men that's how we
[1:01:35] lived before but to the will of God so
[1:01:38] how do I live to the will of God his
[1:01:40] word is his will amen what word the word
[1:01:42] that's been restored to us in this end
[1:01:44] time by the grace of God we now have his
[1:01:47] will anden if you want to know the will
[1:01:49] of God you've got 1200 tapes I I I
[1:01:52] suggest you start combing over them to
[1:01:53] find the will of God amen amen amen now
[1:01:58] let's go to First
[1:02:02] John first John chapter
[1:02:07] 2 1 John chapter
[1:02:11] 2:15 John says love not the world
[1:02:14] neither the things that are in the world
[1:02:16] if any man love the world the love of
[1:02:18] the father is not in him for all that is
[1:02:20] in the world the lust of the flesh the
[1:02:22] lust of the eyes the pride of the pride
[1:02:25] of life is not of the father but it is
[1:02:28] of the world and the world passes away
[1:02:31] with the lust thereof but he that doeth
[1:02:34] the will of God abideth
[1:02:37] forever amen I'm so glad that God has
[1:02:40] made the mystery of his will known in
[1:02:42] our days so that we have we have the
[1:02:44] will of God to look at so that we can
[1:02:46] subject ourselves to it and surrender
[1:02:48] and say oh God come and make that Word
[1:02:50] Alive in me I surrender to it I choose
[1:02:53] it I I give up my own desire and I take
[1:02:56] that revelation of the word to manifest
[1:02:59] in my life amen because he that doeth
[1:03:02] the will of God abideth forever you know
[1:03:05] how frustrating this scripture is if you
[1:03:07] don't know the will of
[1:03:11] God and if you've got 40,000
[1:03:13] denominations all telling you a
[1:03:15] different version of the will of
[1:03:16] God oh thank God for his Mercy in our
[1:03:20] day thank God for his grace to bring his
[1:03:22] word what his desire is for a bride how
[1:03:25] he wants to dress walk talk amen how to
[1:03:28] conduct their Church how to conduct
[1:03:29] ourselves in church how to deal with
[1:03:31] their families how to raise their
[1:03:32] children how to how to work in the
[1:03:34] workplace amen I'm so glad that God has
[1:03:37] brought his mind to us and made this
[1:03:39] book live so that we can live the
[1:03:42] book I'm so thankful amen and there's
[1:03:45] nothing in me wants to change it alter
[1:03:47] it amen or do away with it I just want
[1:03:49] to surrender to and say oh God let that
[1:03:51] word that you've restored in our day Let
[1:03:53] It Be Alive in me and help me to give up
[1:03:56] the lust of the flesh amen the pride of
[1:03:58] life the lust of the eyes and just do
[1:04:01] your
[1:04:03] will amen back in wisdom versus Faith he
[1:04:06] says Jesus noted by faith in the
[1:04:09] revelation of God's word in his own
[1:04:12] predestinated life amen God knowed it by
[1:04:15] faith and he's saying that Satan knowed
[1:04:17] it intellectually so he's comparing and
[1:04:19] contrasting the two in the but listen he
[1:04:22] noted by faith in the revelation of
[1:04:25] God's word in his own predestinated life
[1:04:28] so now how did he know it by faith he
[1:04:30] knew it by faith in his own
[1:04:32] predestinated
[1:04:33] life listen what he says Glory I hope
[1:04:36] that soaks Plum into your heart Jesus
[1:04:39] knew who he was Satan was
[1:04:47] wondering Jesus knew who he was but
[1:04:50] Satan was
[1:04:51] wondering if thou be
[1:04:57] praise God he knowed that he was a
[1:04:59] predestinated creature of God that God
[1:05:01] himself was manifested in him it wasn't
[1:05:04] him doing the works it was the father
[1:05:06] that dwelt in him amen now listen to to
[1:05:10] Jesus when he talks to and when he when
[1:05:12] he talks to the Pharisees he talks to
[1:05:14] the those in religion in that day he
[1:05:16] said it's not me that doeth the work but
[1:05:18] it's the father that dwelleth in me see
[1:05:20] he's subject to the will of God he's
[1:05:23] subject to the thought of God
[1:05:26] and he realizes that he's not doing
[1:05:28] anything on his own of his own accord
[1:05:30] amen he's only doing as the father leads
[1:05:32] and as the father equips and as the
[1:05:34] father
[1:05:36] supplies he's giving us a perfect
[1:05:38] example amen he says now he goes on he
[1:05:41] says let the devil fly with all of his
[1:05:43] theology Jesus Satan knew it he knew the
[1:05:47] word now he could quote the scripture
[1:05:50] boy just like a walking
[1:05:53] Bible he's talking about Satan he's not
[1:05:55] talking about Jesus here he's talking
[1:05:56] about Satan he he knew the
[1:06:00] word but he didn't know the
[1:06:03] [Applause]
[1:06:04] logos you understand
[1:06:06] now Satan knew it he knew the word now
[1:06:09] he could quote that scripture boy just
[1:06:11] like a walking
[1:06:14] Bible he could just quote it like that
[1:06:16] and brother B snaps but Jesus Stood
[1:06:19] Still for he knew where he was standing
[1:06:23] he know that he was predestinated was
[1:06:25] the lamb slain before the foundation of
[1:06:27] the world he knowed he was that person
[1:06:29] oh brother he that has an ear let him
[1:06:33] hear he know that he was predestinated
[1:06:35] for that and that's the way he knew the
[1:06:38] word see and it
[1:06:40] worked how did he know the word he knew
[1:06:43] the word from his predestinated
[1:06:46] position that's how he knew the word he
[1:06:49] knew the word by knowing who he was and
[1:06:51] by knowing who he was gave him the
[1:06:53] revelation of the word he couldn't do it
[1:06:55] vice
[1:06:57] versa Satan knew the word but he didn't
[1:07:01] know Jesus's
[1:07:02] position he was
[1:07:05] wondering
[1:07:06] amen let's go to Matthew chapter
[1:07:16] 4 I tell you what Satan may be wondering
[1:07:19] about you and I but we better not be
[1:07:22] wondering amen may God give us a
[1:07:24] revelation of of who we
[1:07:27] are amen Matthew
[1:07:32] 4 uh Matthew
[1:07:37] 4:1 then was Jesus led up of the spirit
[1:07:39] Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the
[1:07:42] devil and when he had fasted 40 days and
[1:07:44] 40 nights he was afterward a hungered
[1:07:46] and when the tempter came to him he said
[1:07:48] if thou be the Son of God command that
[1:07:50] these Stones be made bread but he
[1:07:52] answered and said it is written man
[1:07:54] shall not live by bread of alone but by
[1:07:56] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:07:57] mouth of God Amen then the devil taketh
[1:08:01] him up into a holy city and sth him on a
[1:08:03] pinnacle of the temple and saith un him
[1:08:06] if thou be the Son of God cast thyself
[1:08:08] down for it is written he shall give his
[1:08:10] angels charge concerning thee and their
[1:08:13] hands they shall bear thee up lest at
[1:08:15] any time thou Dash thy foot against the
[1:08:17] stone I want you to stop right there
[1:08:19] verse six Satan quoted the Bible nearly
[1:08:23] verbatim you want to know that something
[1:08:25] that's odd is when Jesus quotes the
[1:08:27] Bible he hardly ever quotes it
[1:08:30] verbatim he always changes something and
[1:08:34] it changes it to match the application
[1:08:36] for the day but Satan didn't change
[1:08:38] anything he quoted it just like it was
[1:08:40] written in the Old Testament you know
[1:08:42] who else handled the scripture the way
[1:08:44] Jesus did the Apostle Paul handled the
[1:08:46] scripture he would quote but rarely
[1:08:48] would he quote and he didn't quote Whole
[1:08:50] sentences or whole scriptures sometimes
[1:08:52] he pulled out just fragments and
[1:08:54] sometimes he didn't quote it verbatim
[1:08:56] but you know who quoted it verbatim
[1:08:58] without a mistake was Satan when he was
[1:09:00] quoting it to
[1:09:02] Jesus we need more than intellect more
[1:09:05] than quoting scriptures more than
[1:09:07] reading we need a revelation of the
[1:09:09] thought of God behind the word to know
[1:09:12] how to apply the word that's why Jesus
[1:09:14] could pull a fragment amen that David
[1:09:16] was saying not say all that was David
[1:09:18] was saying but just a fragment of what
[1:09:20] David said apply it to himself and apply
[1:09:22] it to that day and the devil would be
[1:09:24] like wait wait a minute no no no no you
[1:09:27] didn't quote the whole verse and you
[1:09:28] didn't use that in context and that
[1:09:30] applies to David it didn't matter
[1:09:32] because he had the original thought
[1:09:34] behind the word and he knew that it
[1:09:36] applied to
[1:09:38] him amen that's why all of this
[1:09:41] religious intellectual using of the
[1:09:43] Bible it's not going to work we've not
[1:09:46] been called to be Bible students we've
[1:09:48] not been called to become theologians we
[1:09:50] not become to called to make the message
[1:09:52] intellectual we're just here to believe
[1:09:54] the word to accept what a prophet
[1:09:57] brought and believe it for the truth and
[1:09:59] say that's nothing but the truth brother
[1:10:02] Brandon amen you know who else doesn't
[1:10:05] quote verbatim you know who else use
[1:10:07] fragments is you know who else seems to
[1:10:09] pull it out of context the prophet of
[1:10:11] God for this day he uses the scripture
[1:10:13] the same way Paul used the scripture and
[1:10:15] the same way Jesus used the scripture
[1:10:17] but the Pharisees quoted exact and Satan
[1:10:20] quoted it
[1:10:22] [Applause]
[1:10:23] exact God
[1:10:26] God made it so only revelation will cut
[1:10:29] through not intellect not theology not
[1:10:32] study it's only going to be Revelation
[1:10:35] that Taps you back into the thought of
[1:10:39] God so now verse six is a
[1:10:43] beautiful quote from the Bible right and
[1:10:46] it happens to be
[1:10:49] true it's not even used wrong as far as
[1:10:53] the application to Jesus
[1:10:56] right yeah cuz it's referring to
[1:11:01] him oh don't you love it to be so close
[1:11:05] it to De see the very elected he was
[1:11:07] using the word quoting it right and even
[1:11:10] applying it to the right
[1:11:14] person verse 7 Jesus said unto him it is
[1:11:17] written again Thou shalt not tempt the
[1:11:19] Lord thy God Amen Jesus quoted the
[1:11:22] scripture Satan quoted the scripture
[1:11:25] whose scripture wins the one that has
[1:11:28] the
[1:11:30] thought
[1:11:32] amen verse eight again the devil taketh
[1:11:35] him up unto an exceeding high mountain
[1:11:36] and showeth him all the kingdoms of the
[1:11:38] world and the glory of them and sayith
[1:11:40] unto him all these things will I give
[1:11:41] thee if thou Willl Fall Down and Worship
[1:11:43] me then saith Jesus unto him get thee
[1:11:46] hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt
[1:11:48] Worship the Lord thy God and him only
[1:11:50] shalt thou serve then the devil leaveth
[1:11:53] him and behold Angels Came and
[1:11:55] ministered unto
[1:11:57] him there there's several things in here
[1:11:59] that I want to highlight Jesus first
[1:12:02] knew who he
[1:12:04] was that is so important when he gets
[1:12:07] into a a a scriptural debate with Satan
[1:12:10] it's really important that he already
[1:12:11] knows what he is because D Satan's not
[1:12:14] sure who he is amen but but Jesus is
[1:12:17] sure of who he
[1:12:19] is and because he's sure of who he is he
[1:12:22] doesn't have to take any of the bait
[1:12:24] that Satan is offering him and Satan
[1:12:27] starts off by saying if thou be the Son
[1:12:29] of God Amen this is the first Temptation
[1:12:32] because now what he's trying to do is
[1:12:35] he's trying to get Jesus to use the word
[1:12:39] to vindicate
[1:12:42] himself he said well doesn't the word
[1:12:44] vindicate him yes the word Vindicated to
[1:12:46] be the Son of God he said if you don't
[1:12:48] believe on me believe on the works that
[1:12:49] I do do not they tell you who I
[1:12:52] am but that was done by the will of the
[1:12:55] father not his own will he did that he
[1:12:57] did nothing L the father showed him so
[1:13:00] he was never to take the word to
[1:13:02] vindicate himself although the word
[1:13:05] would vindicate him he wasn't supposed
[1:13:07] to take the word to vindicate himself
[1:13:09] cuz he was supposed to stay submissive
[1:13:11] to the leadership of the father and only
[1:13:14] only do what the father showed him so
[1:13:17] here Satan listen Satan's trying to get
[1:13:20] him to take the word to vindicate
[1:13:22] himself because he is the word the word
[1:13:23] will vindicate him he has all power and
[1:13:25] authority he can do it all but he would
[1:13:27] have done it outside the will of God
[1:13:30] therefore it wouldn't have been the
[1:13:31] thought of God and therefore it would
[1:13:32] have been perverted
[1:13:37] word he had to know who he
[1:13:40] was so that he wouldn't take the devil's
[1:13:44] bait the devil may try to get you to
[1:13:46] prove prove your bride of Christ where's
[1:13:49] your
[1:13:50] testimonies what have you done
[1:13:53] lately listen I don't need need any of
[1:13:55] that to prove who I am I Know Who I Am
[1:13:57] by
[1:13:58] revelation God vindicates his bride with
[1:14:01] his word the word vindicates amen it's
[1:14:03] been Vindicated in our lives over and
[1:14:05] over and over again but but there's all
[1:14:07] kinds of denominations with all kinds of
[1:14:09] vindications and they're off the word
[1:14:11] amen I don't need a Vindication amen
[1:14:13] what I need is a
[1:14:15] revelation because who am I trying to
[1:14:18] prove my brideship too I don't need to
[1:14:20] prove it to you if I can convince you
[1:14:22] I'm bride that doesn't matter I'm the
[1:14:24] one who needs to be convinced that I'm
[1:14:26] bride I'm the one who needs to know
[1:14:28] because if I convince you and still have
[1:14:30] a question in my heart that I'm going to
[1:14:31] be working all the time to try to
[1:14:33] convince you and you and you and you I'm
[1:14:35] bride and if you all agree then somehow
[1:14:36] I can quiet the question mark that's in
[1:14:38] my own
[1:14:40] heart but it will never stop amen you'll
[1:14:43] constantly be on the devil's treadmill
[1:14:44] trying to take the word and force it and
[1:14:47] prove it amen to vindicate that you're
[1:14:49] the Son of God right that's why the
[1:14:53] first revelation is the greatest
[1:14:55] Revelation that God can reveal to you
[1:14:57] that you're part of his mind you're part
[1:14:59] of his thoughts you're C gen of him that
[1:15:02] you're part of his plan from the
[1:15:03] beginning and then you don't need to
[1:15:05] prove anything to anybody and so what if
[1:15:08] nobody believes your bride that doesn't
[1:15:10] matter the only one that matters is me
[1:15:12] because I don't have to convince God he
[1:15:14] already knows the only one who needs to
[1:15:16] know on this Earth is
[1:15:18] me I don't need to convince my wife I
[1:15:21] don't need to convince my children I
[1:15:22] don't need to convince anybody else I'm
[1:15:25] the one who needs convinced of who I
[1:15:28] am amen and amen and those of you who'
[1:15:33] had Supernatural Vindication
[1:15:34] Supernatural manifestation in your life
[1:15:37] you know the truth amen you can have the
[1:15:39] most Supernatural thing take place in
[1:15:41] your life and 10 15 years down the Lo
[1:15:43] Road amen everything in your life can be
[1:15:45] coming falling apart amen and things can
[1:15:47] be going wrong and everybody can be
[1:15:49] turning against you and you yourself can
[1:15:50] make a mistake and the devil will still
[1:15:52] whisper in your ear you think you're a
[1:15:54] bride
[1:15:55] yes so at that stage that Vindication
[1:15:58] still doesn't hold he's still
[1:16:00] questioning who you are there's got to
[1:16:03] be something deeper than that it's got
[1:16:05] to be way down in the soul amen
[1:16:07] something he can't root out or Reason
[1:16:09] [Applause]
[1:16:11] away because he can also point out do
[1:16:14] you remember the brother he hadn't
[1:16:15] experienced real similar and look he
[1:16:17] fell away he doesn't believe the message
[1:16:18] anymore his family's in ruin and he's
[1:16:20] becoming this or that yes yes he's the
[1:16:24] master
[1:16:26] that's why we can't use anything that
[1:16:29] the devil tries to tempt us with we
[1:16:31] can't mishandle the word for selfish
[1:16:36] reasons so first he tried to get him to
[1:16:38] vindicate self with the word would the
[1:16:42] word vindicate him yes did God want the
[1:16:44] manifestation word to vindicate him yes
[1:16:47] but it was going to be done according to
[1:16:48] God's will as God showed him what to do
[1:16:51] not of his own accord that's right
[1:16:55] amen then he says you're hungry just get
[1:16:59] yourself in bread prove that you're the
[1:17:01] son of man and take care of yourself at
[1:17:03] the same time there's the second trap
[1:17:06] trying to take care of ourselves of our
[1:17:09] flesh
[1:17:11] man hey I'm not here to provide for
[1:17:13] myself I'm a sheep and I have a
[1:17:17] Shepherd I'm a wife and I have a
[1:17:20] husband so that's another Temptation
[1:17:23] with the word
[1:17:25] then he comes and he he quotes him the
[1:17:27] Bible beautifully and said this verse
[1:17:30] applies to you he gives his angels
[1:17:32] charge concerning thee that lest you
[1:17:35] should Dash thy foot against the stone
[1:17:37] that's a scripture concerning you and
[1:17:40] that's the
[1:17:41] truth he said so now throw yourself down
[1:17:45] off of this Temple to prove that you are
[1:17:48] the Fulfillment of this
[1:17:49] scripture my goodness when you back up
[1:17:51] and think about it it's ludicrous
[1:17:54] but this is what he's doing tempting
[1:17:56] because Jesus had to be tempted to prove
[1:17:59] that he would stay with the word
[1:18:00] according to God's will so he was giving
[1:18:03] him the word he was giv him a true word
[1:18:05] and a word that applied to him and he
[1:18:07] was trying to for he was trying to get
[1:18:11] Jesus to force God to manifest and
[1:18:14] vindicate him by throwing him off of a
[1:18:17] pinnacle and making
[1:18:19] God then who becomes subject to whom
[1:18:25] who's the Lord amen and who's the
[1:18:27] servant now if he climbs up on a
[1:18:29] pinnacle because of the scripture and
[1:18:30] thrust himself throws himself down
[1:18:32] forcing God Amen to make this scripture
[1:18:36] work in his life listen that's not the
[1:18:38] way it works
[1:18:39] friends we're not the ones to dictate
[1:18:42] how this will come to pass we're not the
[1:18:44] ones that dictate amen what is the
[1:18:46] application of he gives his angels
[1:18:48] charge concerning thee unless thou Dash
[1:18:50] thy foot upon a stone I'm not the one to
[1:18:52] bring it to pass by my own reasoning or
[1:18:54] intellect or Temptation Of The Devil I'm
[1:18:56] here to wait for God to bring that to
[1:18:58] pass any way he wants it's a true
[1:19:00] scripture it applies to me I believe God
[1:19:02] will bring it to pass but I have no idea
[1:19:04] how he wants to prove
[1:19:07] that listen and if I take my own mind to
[1:19:10] to vindicate myself and to force God to
[1:19:13] do something for me amen now I've become
[1:19:16] the dictator of the word and I've become
[1:19:17] the one who dictates how it's going to
[1:19:19] be made manifest yes and I'm not
[1:19:22] interested in that because I've messed
[1:19:23] up everything else in my life life and I
[1:19:25] sure don't want to mess this
[1:19:28] up so he tries to get God to force God
[1:19:34] to vindica him I think that's so
[1:19:41] Sinister and to the last one was he
[1:19:44] offered him the kingdoms of the world
[1:19:47] and he tried to get him to promote
[1:19:49] himself outside of God's time and
[1:19:51] outside of God's will this is the
[1:19:54] temptation in the wilderness what kind
[1:19:56] of Temptation do you think we
[1:20:00] face you say you know I was never in the
[1:20:03] wilderness 40 days and I was never
[1:20:05] hungry and I never had Satan made Stones
[1:20:07] no he's done this to you over and over
[1:20:10] and over again the same exact
[1:20:13] Temptations to promote self outside of
[1:20:16] God's time and will to protect self
[1:20:18] outside and provide for self outside of
[1:20:20] God's time and will and to prove self
[1:20:23] yes yes
[1:20:25] we have to get away with the things of
[1:20:27] the world and the lust thereof and do
[1:20:30] the will of
[1:20:32] God again in wisdom versus Faith he says
[1:20:36] Jesus know it by experience he know it
[1:20:38] by Revelation he know that he was the
[1:20:40] son of God and that was to come into the
[1:20:41] world he knowed his standing he knowed
[1:20:44] he was born in this world for that
[1:20:45] purpose and that's the reason the word
[1:20:47] of God could work through him because he
[1:20:50] knowed what he was is it Jesus says it
[1:20:55] is written said Jesus yes sir Satan
[1:20:57] couldn't tempt him no sir he is past
[1:21:00] that but Jesus was the word his faith in
[1:21:03] the knowledge of his that he was the
[1:21:07] word what did Jesus have faith in he had
[1:21:11] faith in the knowledge of hisself that
[1:21:13] he was the
[1:21:16] word what is the bride supposed to be
[1:21:19] the word what are we supposed to have
[1:21:22] faith in that we're the word that we are
[1:21:24] God's thoughts made manifest in this
[1:21:26] life and there's nothing I have to prove
[1:21:29] there's nothing I have to do all I have
[1:21:31] to do is follow his word and follow his
[1:21:33] will and he will do everything that he's
[1:21:36] promised to
[1:21:37] doen but I can't get ahead of his
[1:21:40] program Jesus was the word his faith in
[1:21:43] the knowledge of his that he was the
[1:21:44] word listen just like Moses why Moses
[1:21:48] knew who he was Moses knew he was God's
[1:21:51] servant knowed he was called of God he
[1:21:53] know what he was going to do that's the
[1:21:55] reason he wasn't scared what Satan said
[1:21:57] Satan tried to tempt him scare him out
[1:21:59] of it but no Moses knew where he was
[1:22:02] standing Moses couldn't do anything but
[1:22:05] what God said he couldn't do anything
[1:22:07] outside of what God told him to do he
[1:22:09] had no ability to do anything else when
[1:22:11] God told him to throw a rod down it
[1:22:12] turned into a serpent and he said go do
[1:22:14] it before Pharaoh all he could do was
[1:22:16] throw a rod down and watch it turn into
[1:22:18] a serpent when The Magicians did the
[1:22:19] same thing he had nothing else to say
[1:22:22] because God told him nothing else to say
[1:22:24] he could couldn't inject his own
[1:22:25] thoughts and start making excuses and
[1:22:27] reasons why it didn't work all he had to
[1:22:29] do was sit still and wait because he did
[1:22:32] what God Said do listen that's the
[1:22:35] greatest lesson for all of us God has
[1:22:37] sent his word in this day he has
[1:22:38] unveiled the word he's told us who we
[1:22:40] are and he's told us what he wants us to
[1:22:42] do he's given us his word all we need to
[1:22:45] do is Faithfully apply that word and
[1:22:47] Obey it and just wait and let God do
[1:22:49] what he's going to do when it doesn't
[1:22:51] happen the way we think it's going to
[1:22:53] happen our else happens that we didn't
[1:22:55] expect that's not time to start making
[1:22:57] excuses and start coming up with
[1:22:59] reasoning that's the time to just keep
[1:23:01] our mouth shut be quiet and wait because
[1:23:04] I did this because the prophet said do
[1:23:06] it I did it because you revealed it in
[1:23:08] your word I did it because you said the
[1:23:09] bride this is what the bride is supposed
[1:23:11] to do that's why I did this now I'm
[1:23:14] waiting for
[1:23:16] you either tell me what to do next or
[1:23:19] work it out I don't know what else to do
[1:23:25] so Moses knew we need to know further
[1:23:29] down he says if Jesus defeated Satan
[1:23:31] upon fa the
[1:23:33] faith catch clearly what he says if
[1:23:36] Jesus defeat and S upon the faith
[1:23:39] knowing who he
[1:23:41] was he was a predestinated creature are
[1:23:44] you
[1:23:46] ready what about the predestinated Bride
[1:23:48] of Jesus Christ now you believe the
[1:23:50] bride is
[1:23:52] predestinated this is what he said
[1:23:55] Jesus defeated Satan upon the faith
[1:23:58] knowing who he
[1:24:01] was what is the faith of our
[1:24:05] day really what is the faith it's I have
[1:24:09] faith in God's word and I have faith in
[1:24:11] God and I have faith in Jesus Christ and
[1:24:13] I have faith in all these things but
[1:24:15] listen many people in the world will say
[1:24:17] the same things that you say but really
[1:24:19] what gave what gave Jesus the power to
[1:24:22] overcome the Temptation is he had faith
[1:24:25] in the word of God which was
[1:24:28] himself faith in his allotment faith in
[1:24:31] his portion faith in who he was by God's
[1:24:34] predestinated plan and how is the bride
[1:24:38] going to overcome the devil in this day
[1:24:41] the same
[1:24:43] thing right you can have faith in all
[1:24:45] the other people you want faith in my
[1:24:47] mom and dad faith in my pastor faith in
[1:24:49] brother brandham faith in this faith in
[1:24:51] that faith in the Bible faith in all of
[1:24:53] this but if you have no faith in who you
[1:24:56] are yes how are you going to stand The
[1:24:59] Temptations in this
[1:25:01] hour Faith listen this is not this is
[1:25:04] not uh self-inflated this is the
[1:25:07] reality I have to believe in what God
[1:25:10] said about me I have to believe it I
[1:25:13] have to accept it as true if I continue
[1:25:15] doubting and excusing it away I'm never
[1:25:17] going to get anywhere it's always going
[1:25:18] to be two steps forward two steps back
[1:25:20] it's always going to be success and
[1:25:21] failure I've got to I've got to come to
[1:25:24] terms with the reality of what this
[1:25:26] message
[1:25:27] says and who it's for and what it's
[1:25:29] supposed to
[1:25:34] produce in the paman church age in the
[1:25:38] church age book brother brandham has a
[1:25:39] section in there where he talks about
[1:25:41] the time the angel of the Lord told him
[1:25:42] to pick up his pen and write and you
[1:25:44] know it really well but I'm going to
[1:25:45] read just a small section and he says
[1:25:48] notice the harmony of the father and the
[1:25:50] son Jesus never did anything until it
[1:25:53] was first showed him by the father
[1:25:54] Father John
[1:25:56] 5:19 this harmony is now to exist
[1:25:58] between the groom and his bride he shows
[1:26:01] her his Word of Life she receives it she
[1:26:04] never doubts it
[1:26:06] amen praise God therefore nothing can
[1:26:11] harm her not even
[1:26:13] death for if the seed be planted the
[1:26:16] water will raise it up again here is the
[1:26:18] secret of this the word is in the bride
[1:26:21] as it was in Mary the bride has the mind
[1:26:23] of Christ for she knows what he wants
[1:26:25] done with the word the question is how
[1:26:27] did we get the mind of Christ to know
[1:26:29] what he wants done with the word that
[1:26:30] came through a prophetic gift that's how
[1:26:33] we know that that we we've got it
[1:26:35] through the message of the hour that's
[1:26:37] how we know the mind of Christ and what
[1:26:39] he wants done with the word because he's
[1:26:40] restored the
[1:26:43] word the bride has the mind of Christ
[1:26:45] for she knows what he wants done with
[1:26:46] the word she performs the command of the
[1:26:49] word in his name for she has thus sayeth
[1:26:52] the Lord then the word is quickened by
[1:26:54] the spirit and it comes to pass like a
[1:26:56] seed that is planted and watered it
[1:26:57] comes to full Harvest serving its
[1:27:00] purpose those in the bride do only his
[1:27:04] will no one can make them do otherwise
[1:27:07] not even Satan quoting scriptures to you
[1:27:09] and saying if you're bride make this
[1:27:11] scripture work if you're bride do this
[1:27:14] let me see you do this and I'll believe
[1:27:16] you're
[1:27:17] bride are you kidding me as soon as I do
[1:27:20] that you won't believe you'll give me
[1:27:21] something else to do I'm not I'm too
[1:27:23] tired to follow that path I'm exhausted
[1:27:26] I'm just going to believe the
[1:27:29] word as soon as you start jumping
[1:27:31] through the devil's Hoops you know he'll
[1:27:32] be like okay all right I if you do if
[1:27:36] you perform this word if this word comes
[1:27:37] to pass then you're bride you jump
[1:27:39] through oh I'm bright well no no really
[1:27:41] there's another scripture and he moves
[1:27:42] it
[1:27:43] higher and then he moves it high and
[1:27:45] then he sets it on
[1:27:48] fire now jump through that
[1:27:50] one right it's a NeverEnding Trail to
[1:27:53] nowhere
[1:27:55] if God's given you a revelation amen of
[1:27:58] who you are and it's settled in your
[1:27:59] heart then let it stay settled in your
[1:28:01] heart don't question don't worry don't
[1:28:04] fret just obey the word take the mind of
[1:28:07] Christ that was given to us through the
[1:28:08] message of the hour amen through the
[1:28:10] opening of the word and take the mind of
[1:28:12] Christ and let it be your mind upon the
[1:28:15] word and live it just surrender to it
[1:28:17] just obey and the parts that you can't
[1:28:19] seem to get Just Surrender and say God
[1:28:21] you've got to make this work in me cuz
[1:28:23] I'm
[1:28:25] struggling and then let him come and
[1:28:28] perform the word and just stick with
[1:28:31] that he said I'm going to read this
[1:28:34] again those in the bride do only his
[1:28:36] will no one can make them do otherwise
[1:28:38] they have thus sayeth the Lord or they
[1:28:40] keep still why is it no one can make
[1:28:42] them do otherwise it's because they
[1:28:44] don't need to do
[1:28:48] otherwise listen I I hope that I can get
[1:28:51] this home I hope I can get this one
[1:28:53] point driven home right now they don't
[1:28:56] need to do otherwise because Jesus
[1:28:59] didn't need to do otherwise he only
[1:29:00] needed to do what the father told him he
[1:29:02] didn't have anything to prove he didn't
[1:29:04] have to protect himself defend himself
[1:29:06] promote himself there was no part of
[1:29:08] self that he had to engage amen for
[1:29:10] himself he was totally surrendered to
[1:29:12] the hand of God and whatever God wanted
[1:29:15] for him is what he surrendered himself
[1:29:17] to why is it they can't make her do
[1:29:20] otherwise is because she doesn't need to
[1:29:23] do otherwise because she doesn't have to
[1:29:25] prove protect promote defend
[1:29:30] herself she just stays behind the wall
[1:29:32] of the word and she lets her husband
[1:29:33] take care of
[1:29:37] it that's where the deception
[1:29:40] is is trying to create in you a
[1:29:43] need trying to create in you and I an
[1:29:47] insecurity and a need to we need to
[1:29:50] prove
[1:29:51] vindicate promote
[1:29:54] but God came with an open book and he
[1:29:57] came
[1:29:58] himself to take away all our
[1:30:01] insecurities he brought a prophetic gift
[1:30:03] in our day a gift that there's never
[1:30:06] been anything recorded like it in the
[1:30:08] history of
[1:30:09] mankind Vindication upon Vindication
[1:30:12] upon Vindication and then word upon word
[1:30:15] upon word why did God do such a thing in
[1:30:18] this day he did it to take away your and
[1:30:20] I
[1:30:22] insecurity because why he brought this
[1:30:25] message to his
[1:30:27] bride well how do I know I'm bride do
[1:30:30] you believe the
[1:30:35] message he brought this message to his
[1:30:38] bride am I bride question is do you
[1:30:42] believe the
[1:30:44] message have you received it do you
[1:30:46] believe it with all your heart and why
[1:30:49] question if you're bride Just Surrender
[1:30:50] to it you can't receive it you can't
[1:30:54] believe it in your soul unless you're
[1:30:56] predestinated to believe
[1:30:59] it don't let Satan put Hoops out here
[1:31:02] for you to jump through to prove who you
[1:31:03] are I'm there's no proving God's
[1:31:06] revealed to me the message I just
[1:31:08] believe it and I didn't believe it
[1:31:10] because I even wanted to I believed it
[1:31:12] because I couldn't help but believe
[1:31:14] it there was something inside of me
[1:31:17] believing when there was something
[1:31:19] outside of me questioning and doubting
[1:31:20] there was something inside of me
[1:31:22] believing at the same time
[1:31:24] at the same time I was saying this can't
[1:31:26] be true there was something inside of me
[1:31:27] saying that's nothing but the
[1:31:30] TR
[1:31:33] amen
[1:31:35] so no one can make them do
[1:31:39] otherwise I mean even if somebody puts a
[1:31:41] gun to your head and say deny water
[1:31:44] baptism in jesus' name it's like I mean
[1:31:46] pull the trigger as fast as you can I'm
[1:31:49] going to the sixth Dimension he's taken
[1:31:51] away all my insecurity he's given me the
[1:31:53] revelation of even where I go to when I
[1:31:55] leave this body like what what are you
[1:31:57] going to do to somebody who's been given
[1:31:59] the full
[1:32:04] picture I mean I what a
[1:32:07] privilege I would deny it so fast amen
[1:32:10] praise God it's going to be this easy
[1:32:13] Lord I didn't
[1:32:15] realize but you realize nothing no one
[1:32:18] can make her do
[1:32:20] otherwise and I I don't mean to make
[1:32:22] light of that but there's more Tri than
[1:32:24] that coming there's more pressures and
[1:32:25] more deceptive just like Satan coming to
[1:32:28] Jesus but what we need is a revelation
[1:32:31] of who we are that that we are part of
[1:32:33] the good pleasure of his will to bring
[1:32:35] us to adoption and now what does he want
[1:32:38] me to do in this life he's already
[1:32:40] revealed it in the message all I need to
[1:32:42] do is take the mind of Christ concerning
[1:32:44] the word and let my life reflect that
[1:32:49] word that
[1:32:51] simple let's not make it complicated
[1:32:53] let's keep it
[1:32:56] simple they have thus sayith the Lord or
[1:32:58] they keep Still They Know listen here's
[1:33:00] another key phrase they know that it has
[1:33:02] to be God in them doing the works
[1:33:05] fulfilling his own word he did not
[1:33:08] complete all his work while in his
[1:33:10] Earthly Ministry so now he works in and
[1:33:13] through the bride she knows that for it
[1:33:16] was not yet time for him to do certain
[1:33:18] things that he must now do but he will
[1:33:20] now fulfill through the bride the work
[1:33:23] which he left for this specific
[1:33:27] time so what works do you have to do
[1:33:31] surrender because it's a work he left
[1:33:33] for himself to do he just needs my body
[1:33:37] am in Christ is the mystery of God
[1:33:38] revealed the prophet says now you can
[1:33:40] see now the end time message why it's
[1:33:43] rejected now no denomination but the
[1:33:45] revelation of his mystery see no
[1:33:47] denomination the revelation God is not
[1:33:49] known by the nomination he is known by
[1:33:51] Revelation look God in his body Christ
[1:33:54] and Christ in his body the bride oh oh
[1:33:57] oh my God made manifest in Christ Christ
[1:34:01] made manifest in the bride and as God
[1:34:04] took from the body of Adam the woman and
[1:34:05] she fell then God has took from the body
[1:34:07] of Christ his flesh his body which is
[1:34:09] his word and is bringing a bride out
[1:34:11] that won't fall by denomination or Creed
[1:34:14] no sirve but she is coming back with the
[1:34:16] pure unadulterated word of God being
[1:34:21] manifested I hope every man that hears
[1:34:23] this tape and every woman will
[1:34:24] understand that she is the second Eve
[1:34:26] but if she is not breaking and spoiling
[1:34:28] her skirts of Purity and Holiness to her
[1:34:30] husband she'll stay with his word
[1:34:33] regardless of what anybody says you can
[1:34:35] have all the ecumenical moves you want
[1:34:37] to and all the
[1:34:39] affiliations why because she's realized
[1:34:41] she is the
[1:34:42] word that word and me are the same and
[1:34:46] there's nothing else I need now
[1:34:48] everything I need I already have he's
[1:34:51] already revealed it to me
[1:34:53] amen whatever he chooses to manifest is
[1:34:56] what he
[1:35:00] needs I hope you understand what I'm
[1:35:02] saying whatever he needs to manifest
[1:35:05] through my life is what he needs because
[1:35:06] he left a work for this specific time to
[1:35:08] do it and through the bride but he's
[1:35:10] already given me everything I need
[1:35:13] right am the revelation of who I
[1:35:18] am amen
[1:35:24] says but Christ's mystery God revealed
[1:35:26] but this mystery is only revealed to his
[1:35:30] beloved
[1:35:32] bride that's the only one could see it
[1:35:36] now ask you the question are you
[1:35:41] bride amen I just want to go on record
[1:35:44] saying the devil's a
[1:35:46] liar God's word is
[1:35:49] true
[1:35:51] amen Colossians 1:25 says says whereof I
[1:35:54] am made a minister according to the
[1:35:56] dispensation of God which is given to me
[1:35:58] for you to fulfill the word of God even
[1:36:01] the mystery which has been hid from ages
[1:36:02] and from Generations but now is made
[1:36:04] manifest to his Saints to whom God would
[1:36:07] make known what is the riches of the
[1:36:09] glory of this mystery among the Gentiles
[1:36:11] which is Christ in you the hope of
[1:36:15] glory it's not me it's Christ in me it's
[1:36:20] not my works it's his works it's not my
[1:36:22] will it's his will it's not my word it's
[1:36:23] his word I'm just part of it and I
[1:36:27] believe it by faith and I'm resting in
[1:36:30] it that's why the bride can do nothing
[1:36:32] against the truth but for the truth
[1:36:36] because she's part of the truth which is
[1:36:39] the word Thy word is truth she's part of
[1:36:42] the truth that's why she'll surrender
[1:36:44] her life and just Manifest this word and
[1:36:47] take what the prophet said take the word
[1:36:49] that's been restored and just live it
[1:36:52] amen
[1:36:54] Christ is the mystery God revealed one
[1:36:55] last quote but all this mystery is
[1:36:57] revealed only as he promised to his
[1:37:01] bride hell is against this truth of the
[1:37:05] revelation of this mystery but the bride
[1:37:09] is standing on it that's her
[1:37:11] stand what am I standing on that he
[1:37:15] chose me in him before the foundation of
[1:37:18] the world according to the good pleasure
[1:37:20] of his will he has predestinated me to
[1:37:23] the adoption of sons amen and I'm
[1:37:25] standing on the mystery of his will
[1:37:27] revealed to me there's nothing else I
[1:37:30] need to stand on that's our stand man
[1:37:34] God bless you as you stand to your feet
[1:37:36] musicians if you'll come brother Ben if
[1:37:38] you'll please
[1:37:39] come amen let's just bow our
[1:37:43] heads dear heavenly father we thank you
[1:37:46] Lord for this word that you have given
[1:37:47] to us God it's more precious than we
[1:37:50] could ever realize our intellect ual
[1:37:54] capacity has failed we have failed as
[1:37:57] human beings to actually comprehend what
[1:37:59] it is that you've given to us we cannot
[1:38:02] grasp it we cannot imagine it in all
[1:38:04] humanistic ideas and thoughts and
[1:38:06] reasonings there is no way we can come
[1:38:08] to the full gravity of what has been
[1:38:10] placed inside of us but God there's a
[1:38:13] faculty that's beyond intellect there's
[1:38:16] Faith that's down in the soul that says
[1:38:18] I don't understand it I cannot explain
[1:38:21] it but I know it's nothing but the truth
[1:38:24] that you have before the foundation of
[1:38:26] the world you knew that we'd be standing
[1:38:27] here in this day you knew Lord the that
[1:38:30] you knew the fight we would fight you
[1:38:32] knew the resistance we would have you
[1:38:34] knew the tactics of the enemy you knew
[1:38:36] the deception of the age you knew it all
[1:38:38] and so what you did is you portioned a
[1:38:40] portion of yourself for this age and you
[1:38:42] put a portion of yourself inside of our
[1:38:45] souls the ability to believe and God
[1:38:49] you've come to us now and you've
[1:38:50] quickened it Lord by your own Spirit
[1:38:52] you've brought us to life and You'
[1:38:54] brought us the revelation of the word
[1:38:55] and there's something inside of us that
[1:38:57] says it's the
[1:38:59] truth God that's our stand this message
[1:39:03] this revealed word this identification
[1:39:05] of who we really
[1:39:07] are we are a part of this word which
[1:39:11] means we are a part of your thoughts
[1:39:14] which means we are a part of
[1:39:17] you because you were your
[1:39:21] thoughts and when you moved in the love
[1:39:23] formed the word we were there when you
[1:39:26] moved into flesh In the Flesh of your
[1:39:29] son we were
[1:39:30] there God now that portion that you
[1:39:33] identified for expression is here now in
[1:39:37] our Tabernacles of Flesh God and you
[1:39:40] have given us the revelation of this by
[1:39:42] your mercy and by your
[1:39:44] grace God let that be our stand Let It

[1:39:50] it be the solid rock of revelation of
[1:39:52] who you are and who we are in you let it
[1:39:56] be an unmovable foundation and though
[1:39:58] the waves beat and the storms come Lord
[1:40:01] may it not be moving off this Foundation
[1:40:04] because this is a solid rock that goes
[1:40:06] all the way back to your
[1:40:08] thinking God the devil's trying all
[1:40:11] kinds of
[1:40:12] tactics but Lord we reject them all in
[1:40:15] the name of Jesus Christ help us to stay
[1:40:18] with the

[1:40:41] book to become one with it in nature in
[1:40:46] thought May the divine nature take
[1:40:48] control of us as we move into adoption
[1:40:51] and may we take your word
[1:40:53] and just receive it by faith and may we

[1:44:10] you know the last scripture brother
