[16:51] do it in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[16:56] amen amen God bless you we're going to
[16:58] let you have have your seats for just a
[16:59] moment thank you musicians God bless you
[17:02] all I just want to welcome you to the
[17:04] Arctic blast amen praise the lord it's
[17:08] amazing that the temperature can change
[17:10] 45 to 47 degrees in less than two days
[17:14] amen but I just wanted to take a minute
[17:16] and just I wanted to thank the trustees
[17:19] I was coming in this morning and the
[17:20] parking lot was clear the side walks
[17:22] were saled and I know Brother Dean and
[17:24] Xavier got here early and I think
[17:27] brother Greg was here early and the
[17:29] Jonathan was here and they're they're
[17:31] here to make sure that we can have
[17:32] church they're here to make sure that
[17:34] it's safe getting in and out that we
[17:35] have no problems and I just wanted to
[17:38] thank them for that and I also wanted to
[17:39] say it starts long before snowstorm or
[17:43] an artic blast because you know I I was
[17:47] walking in the sanctuary and it was warm
[17:50] and everything was in order and I was
[17:52] thinking you know it's not just when you
[17:54] have cold weather just when you have
[17:56] snow but these brothers have to foresee
[17:59] this all year they have to make sure we
[18:00] have a plow truck something to salt with
[18:03] all the equipment we need and that we
[18:05] keep the heating system well-maintained
[18:07] because it's always in extreme
[18:10] conditions when things break down so
[18:12] extreme conditions when everything's
[18:13] tested and it's not the extreme
[18:15] conditions that that prove whether
[18:17] you've been doing a good job or not I
[18:19] mean they prove it but it's not that
[18:20] moment it's all that time that they put
[18:22] into making sure things aren't left
[18:24] undone this and disrepair but I want to
[18:27] thank God for our trust these and I just
[18:29] want to give them a round of
[18:31] applause
[18:36] amen amen they go unnoticed because if
[18:40] they're noticed it's usually bad amen so
[18:42] we want them to go unnoticed because
[18:44] they're working behind the scenes but we
[18:46] just want to thank them for that I just
[18:48] have a a couple announcements I want to
[18:50] make a few things I want to bring you up
[18:51] to speed
[18:52] on um I will be going Thursday this
[18:56] Thursday out to Holmes County to start a
[18:58] Bible study they've been asking me to
[19:00] come out there so I I'm just asking you
[19:02] to pray about that I'll be going through
[19:04] the church ages book from cover to cover
[19:07] I'm starting from the beginning and go
[19:08] all the way through and I really like to
[19:10] help them get really established in the
[19:12] word of God in the message of the hour
[19:14] so I'll be going out there starting this
[19:16] Thursday and I'll be going every other
[19:18] Thursday till we get through the church
[19:20] ages book um but Levi sent me pictures
[19:23] their their church is now almost
[19:25] complete they've got heating inside and
[19:28] going to be doing the uh Bible study in
[19:31] the new church that they just built this
[19:35] Thursday
[19:37] amen and uh they're having their first
[19:40] service this afternoon amen at 3 p.m. so
[19:43] we thank God for all who contributed
[19:45] we've got quite a few visitors there's a
[19:47] big group that came from Junction City
[19:48] God bless you all we're are glad to have
[19:51] you and they also were up helping uh
[19:53] Levi and the gang up there work on that
[19:55] place so they've contributed a lot of
[19:56] manh hours into that project as well um
[20:00] but also I decided that I'd like to do
[20:03] the same Bible study here so I'm going
[20:05] to start not this Thursday but next
[20:08] Thursday which will be the 25th of
[20:10] January in the fellowship hall at 6:30
[20:13] p.m. on Thursday night I'm going to go
[20:15] through the church age book uh all the
[20:18] way through and a series of Bible
[20:19] studies until we get it
[20:21] done and the reason I'm doing that and
[20:23] the same thing I'm going to do it every
[20:24] other Thursday so I'll be one Thursday
[20:27] in holes County I'll be one Thursday
[20:29] here amen so pray for me uh but I'm
[20:33] excited to go through it again and the
[20:35] one of the main reasons I want to do
[20:36] that is we have so many that God has
[20:39] gathered in and so many new Believers
[20:40] that have just heard the message for the
[20:43] first time within the last year or two
[20:45] and so I really wanted to take these uh
[20:48] new believers who are hearing these
[20:50] things for the first time and also help
[20:51] them get established and I don't know of
[20:53] any better way to do it than the church
[20:55] ages book and so I'm going to go through
[20:58] it from cover to cover uh in the
[21:00] fellowship hall and uh and we've already
[21:03] talked to several of those to make sure
[21:04] that night would work for those that are
[21:06] new amen but we want to open it up to
[21:08] everybody else so if there's anybody
[21:09] else who would like to come especially
[21:11] if you're young or if you've never been
[21:13] to the church age book we'd love for you
[21:15] to come you're welcome to be there and I
[21:17] know Brother Kyle went through it with
[21:19] the youth he went through the entire
[21:20] church age book in a series of Bible
[21:22] studies but I think it's been what four
[21:24] years ago it's hard to believe that wow
[21:28] after four years you got a whole new
[21:30] crop of Youth coming up who didn't go
[21:31] through it so any of those who haven't
[21:33] been through it amen we'd love for for
[21:36] you to join in for that so we'll be
[21:37] doing that starting January 25th anden I
[21:41] also wanted to um introduce you to
[21:44] brother Denny and sister Carrie Ferguson
[21:46] they're sitting right here God bless you
[21:48] all
[21:52] amen they've they've joined us in
[21:55] Fellowship over the last few months I
[21:57] had a chance to sit down down and talk
[21:58] with them amen I asked how they got here
[22:01] and their story is quite amazing but in
[22:03] the end they told me we believe the Lord
[22:06] brought us hereen amen and they were
[22:08] attending a church in Finley that they
[22:10] had been at for more than 30 years I
[22:12] think almost 40 years they had a pastor
[22:14] that they dearly loved who was a lover
[22:17] of the word and taught them the word and
[22:19] uh they they did quite well there and
[22:21] that Pastor passed away a couple years
[22:23] ago and they were looking around trying
[22:26] to find a place to call home and so I
[22:29] asked them how they found us I mean they
[22:32] live in aah and I asked them how they
[22:33] found us and sister Cary went to an old
[22:37] Yellow Pages she had in her
[22:41] house open the old yellow pages and
[22:44] under non-denominational church there's
[22:46] only two listing and because Believers
[22:48] Christian Fellowship starts with a B
[22:50] guess who was
[22:52] first we haven't been in the Yellow
[22:55] Pages for 8 n 10 years or may I don't
[22:58] know how long and so you talk about a
[23:01] needle in the Hast stack God knows how
[23:03] to find his children so they came amen
[23:06] they streamed one service they came they
[23:08] found a familiar place a place that felt
[23:12] comfortable felt like home and they've
[23:14] been hearing the message now amen
[23:16] through fresh ears and enjoying enjoying
[23:19] what they're hearing and believing what
[23:21] they're hearing we say God bless you
[23:22] it's good to have you with us their
[23:24] daughters with them today from to we
[23:26] want to say God bless you all amen I can
[23:29] say God's doing a marvelous work and
[23:32] he's doing a marvelous work nobody can
[23:34] take credit God's going and finding his
[23:36] own sheep and bringing them into the
[23:38] fold and so we just thank God for that
[23:41] so we'll be starting that Bible study as
[23:44] well also want to let you know we're
[23:46] going to have a visitor from Poland come
[23:48] in tomorrow will be with us for one week
[23:50] so they'll be in service Wednesday and
[23:52] Sunday it's brother Cornelius from
[23:54] Poland he grew up in England so you're
[23:56] going to wonder why this PO poish young
[23:58] man has an English accent but he lived
[24:00] all his life in England few years ago he
[24:02] moved back to Poland brother IL and I
[24:04] met him there and I've met him in uh
[24:07] subsequent trips as well he's a nice
[24:09] young brother he wants to do a little
[24:10] traveling he wants to come and see us
[24:12] he's not a minister he's not ministering
[24:13] he just coming to join us for some
[24:15] fellowship so you'll see brother
[24:17] Cornelius Lord willing on Wednesday amen
[24:21] also wanted to let you know that next
[24:23] Sunday January 21st brother Gabe Smith
[24:26] will be up in Lorraine ministering for
[24:28] brother Nathaniel sias so we want to
[24:29] keep him in prayer as well amen there's
[24:34] always a lot amen I like it when there's
[24:36] a lot because a body should be moving
[24:39] and breathing and working and doing and
[24:41] I thank God for that me let's all stand
[24:43] together and let's look into God's word
[24:50] together uh Genesis chapter
[24:56] 2
[24:58] Genesis 2:1 16 if you remember Wednesday
[25:02] I said this was going to be a
[25:03] continuation of the thought there was no
[25:05] not enough time in one service to put
[25:08] this together amen so I preached
[25:10] Wednesday as a to me an incomplete
[25:13] thought so I'm I'm coming back today and
[25:16] I pray that the Lord will help me amen
[25:18] share what's in my heart Genesis
[25:21] 2:16 and the Lord God commanded the man
[25:24] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[25:26] mayest freely eat but of the tree of the
[25:28] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[25:30] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[25:32] eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die
[25:36] amen God bless you as you take your
[25:37] seats and may the Lord bless us as we
[25:40] look into his
[25:43] word the last service we titled
[25:46] Deliverance is first found in the
[25:49] Commandment Deliverance is first found
[25:51] in the Commandment brother B said in the
[25:54] identified Masterpiece of God he said to
[25:56] think that the man that was made in the
[25:58] image of his creator and was given a
[26:01] wall to stand behind and that word could
[26:03] never fail that's the Christian hope
[26:06] it's his shield it's his armor it's his
[26:08] Rock today is to stay behind the word
[26:10] every believer and so we know that that
[26:14] the Deliverance or the protection I say
[26:16] Deliverance because I know if you never
[26:18] fall from the word you never need
[26:19] Deliverance but I don't know any better
[26:21] way to phrase this to give the thought
[26:23] so it may not be a great way to do it
[26:26] but praise God we just do what we can
[26:29] but Deliverance is first found in the
[26:31] Commandment so so many times we
[26:32] transgressed the laws of God and we did
[26:35] we did hear in the Garden of Eden amen
[26:37] Adam and Eve they fell from the word of
[26:40] God they were given a commandment to
[26:41] keep one thing that they had to keep and
[26:44] that word was the safety net that word
[26:46] was the wall that word was the
[26:47] protection that word was security that
[26:49] word was everything and as long as they
[26:52] stayed in that one commandment there'd
[26:54] be no death there'd be no sickness
[26:56] there'd be no heartache there'd be no
[26:57] Thorns no thistles there would be
[26:59] nothing there would be no cold there
[27:01] would be nothing to harm them there
[27:02] would be no death there'd be absolutely
[27:05] no harm if they would have stayed with
[27:06] that one commandment so after the
[27:09] Commandment was transgressed they needed
[27:10] a Deliverance but but when we recognize
[27:13] that Deliverance is first found in the
[27:15] Commandment if we just keep the word of
[27:17] God it'll protect us from so many things
[27:20] and that still holds true today if we
[27:22] would just stay obedient to the voice of
[27:24] God and stay behind the wall of his word
[27:27] and amen there's so many things that it
[27:29] does has and will keep us
[27:32] from amen so let's look turn to Jeremiah
[27:36] this is another scripture for Wednesday
[27:38] we're doing this as a
[27:40] review uh the book of
[27:44] Jeremiah chapter
[27:56] 7
[28:01] Jeremiah 7:
[28:06] 22 says for I spake not unto your
[28:09] fathers nor commanded them in the day
[28:12] that I brought them out of the land of
[28:13] Egypt concerning burnt offerings or
[28:15] sacrifices but this thing commanded I
[28:18] them saying obey my voice and I will be
[28:20] your God and you shall be my people and
[28:23] walk in all the ways that I have
[28:24] commanded you that it may be well unto
[28:28] you so we discussed this last time and
[28:30] talked about how when when God brought
[28:33] them up amen he didn't start off with a
[28:35] law he didn't start off with a a order
[28:38] of sacrifices an order of Temple worship
[28:40] that is not how God began what God
[28:42] wanted was a people who would just obey
[28:44] his voice and he said if you'll obey my
[28:46] voice you'll be a peculiar treasure unto
[28:48] me and all the Earth amen and he and
[28:51] what he wanted was a people just to obey
[28:53] amen but we know they failed right at
[28:55] the beginning we see it in Exodus 9 19
[28:57] they fail right in Exodus when they come
[28:59] to God in si they ran away and they sent
[29:02] Moses instead but what God was wanting
[29:05] was a people that obey and he
[29:08] said uh verse 23 but this thing
[29:11] commanded I them saying obey my voice
[29:13] and I will be your God and you shall be
[29:15] my people and walk ye in all the ways
[29:17] that I have commanded you that it may be
[29:19] well unto you amen God's commandment was
[29:22] good for them it would have protected
[29:25] them it would have kept them safe and
[29:27] the same thing's true today the word of
[29:29] God is for us to keep us safe to keep us
[29:32] from harm to keep us from scars to keep
[29:35] us from mental oppression to keep us
[29:37] from broken homes to keep us from all
[29:39] kinds of disasters the word of God has
[29:41] been given to us to spare us so much
[29:44] trouble and on top of that God has sent
[29:46] a prophet in this day so we wouldn't
[29:48] keep wondering what was what but he
[29:49] would bring us up to the correct
[29:51] interpretation of the word and restore
[29:53] us back Amen to the the the doctrine of
[29:55] the Apostles amen and bring us back to
[29:58] the right understanding and also give us
[30:01] instruction for living in the in
[30:04] leoa it's the tremendous grace of God
[30:07] it's the voice of God in this day and to
[30:09] obey that voice will save us so much
[30:11] heartache so much pain so much
[30:14] suffering let's turn together to
[30:21] Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes chapter 12
[30:25] this is the last chapter right at the
[30:26] end of
[30:31] Ecclesiastes and in chapter TW uh we're
[30:34] going to chapter 12 verse
[30:41] 13 let us hear the conclusion of the
[30:44] whole matter fear God and keep his
[30:47] Commandments for this is the whole duty
[30:50] of
[30:51] man when it comes down to the end of
[30:53] everything what what does Ecclesiastes
[30:56] say fear God and keep his Commandments
[30:59] for this is the whole duty of man that's
[31:01] what man was supposed to do in the
[31:03] Garden of Eden he had one to keep and he
[31:06] failed uh let's let's go to John
[31:10] 14 and we're going to go to the New
[31:12] Testament to show that this is not just
[31:14] an Old Testament uh commandment this is
[31:17] not just a law type thing this is a
[31:20] principle of God and this is a desire of
[31:23] God this is God's desire this is what
[31:25] God wants and this is what he want for
[31:27] his children so his attitude his desire
[31:30] has not changed not just Old Testament
[31:33] but now we're coming in to to the New
[31:35] Testament in John 14 John 14:1
[31:41] 15 Jesus says in John
[31:43] 14:15 if you love me keep my
[31:47] Commandments now verse
[31:49] 23 Jesus answered and said unto him if a
[31:52] man love me he will keep my words and my
[31:55] father will love him and we will come
[31:57] unto him and make our Abode with him he
[31:59] that loveth me not keepeth not my
[32:02] sayings and the word which you hear is
[32:04] not mine but the Father which sent me so
[32:08] it's very clear even in the New
[32:09] Testament that Jesus wants us to keep
[32:12] his
[32:13] Commandments Jesus wants us to obey his
[32:16] voice and we come we we we Wednesday
[32:18] picked it up in the Apostle Paul he says
[32:20] if any of you be spiritual or be a
[32:22] prophet let him acknowledge that the
[32:23] things that I speak unto you they are
[32:25] the words of the Lord they are the
[32:27] Commandments of the Lord so the
[32:29] Commandments of the Lord didn't just
[32:31] stop with the red print in your Bible
[32:33] but it continued on when he came down
[32:35] into his gifts and through his Apostles
[32:37] and he began to give his word and and
[32:39] God Amen Jesus wants us to obey his
[32:44] Commandments why cuz it'll be well with
[32:47] us that's
[32:49] why amen last time we gave some very
[32:52] practical examples we talked about how
[32:55] the Commandment Paul taught a man how he
[32:57] ought to love his wife and a woman how
[32:59] she ought to reverence her husband and
[33:01] we talked about so many times we come
[33:02] into family tension family trouble
[33:05] strife and we start crying out for
[33:07] deliverance we need God to save our
[33:08] marriage we need God to save our home
[33:10] amen but the Deliverance was already in
[33:12] the
[33:13] Commandments if a man will love his wife
[33:16] even as Christ loved the church and gave
[33:18] himself for
[33:21] it and it see that the wife reverence
[33:24] her
[33:25] husband amen if we would just go to what
[33:28] the apostles taught am mean we wouldn't
[33:30] get into the situation down the road
[33:32] where we're crying out for help where
[33:33] we're calling somebody to come and save
[33:35] us to sitting down and working out we we
[33:37] could have worked it out ahead of time
[33:39] and saved ourselves all kinds of
[33:41] Heartache all kinds of trouble all kinds
[33:43] of
[33:45] grief
[33:47] amen we find today that there is such a
[33:51] there is such a a problem with
[33:53] addictions and and we find all kinds of
[33:56] chemical dependency and drug addiction
[33:58] and alcohol and tobac but if we would
[34:00] just obey the word of God and keep our
[34:02] bodies as the Temple of the Holy Ghost
[34:04] and not defile the temple and not defile
[34:06] our bodies it would save us so much
[34:08] trouble that comes from those things we
[34:10] see the world completely uh destroyed
[34:13] young people completely destroyed amen
[34:16] because of these things but the
[34:17] Deliverance is already embedded in the
[34:19] Commandment
[34:21] amen we see young men and unfortunately
[34:24] we see young girls now addicted Amen to
[34:26] look at images they shouldn't the lust
[34:29] are incited and they're addicted to the
[34:31] pictures and videos amen but the
[34:33] scripture already had a Deliverance for
[34:35] this it said I will set no evil thing
[34:38] before mine eyes amen amen and Jesus
[34:41] Jesus says amen job said I made a
[34:44] covenant with my eyes why should I then
[34:46] look upon a maid yeah and Jesus says a
[34:49] man that lookth after a woman to lust
[34:51] after has committed adultery with
[34:52] they're already in his heart the word
[34:54] says don't look don't ever look but then
[34:56] then you start looking in transgression
[34:58] to the commandment and then all of a
[35:00] sudden lust is inside it a an addiction
[35:03] kicks in because of the chemicals that
[35:05] fire in the brain now you're crying out
[35:07] for deliverance because you're addicted
[35:08] to looking at things you shouldn't look
[35:10] at amen but the Commandment was your
[35:12] deliverance don't look the first
[35:16] time it's the truth amen amen if we
[35:20] would just obey his voice we would be
[35:23] spared so much
[35:25] trouble we would just do what the word
[35:28] says do it would help us so
[35:32] much let's look at John 15
[35:43] together John 15 and verse
[35:47] 9 as the father hath loved me so have I
[35:51] loved you continue in my love if you
[35:54] keep my Commandments you shall shall
[35:57] abide in my love even as I have kept my
[35:59] father's Commandments and abide in his
[36:01] love these things have I spoken unto you
[36:04] that my joy might remain in you and that
[36:06] your joy might be full Jesus spoke these
[36:10] things to us that his Joy might remain
[36:13] in us and our joy might be full why
[36:15] because if we keep his Commandments
[36:17] we'll abide we'll stay in his love not
[36:20] that he's going to stop loving us he
[36:22] loved us before the foundation of the
[36:23] world Amen but you can abide in or you
[36:25] can abide outside his love amen because
[36:28] his love is his word you can live in the
[36:30] realm of his word and you can have his
[36:32] joy in
[36:33] you or you can step away amen and you
[36:37] can have trouble and grief and anguish
[36:39] and yeah amen all of these
[36:42] things amen I still haven't given you my
[36:45] title for this morning because I don't
[36:47] want to yet I don't want you to jump to
[36:48] the conclusion I want you to hang with
[36:51] me amen so we know that the Deliverance
[36:54] is first found in the Commandments
[36:57] now let's turn to Proverbs together
[37:01] Proverbs Proverbs chapter
[37:16] 3 I hope that we're thoroughly convinced
[37:19] now that God wants us to obey his
[37:21] voice without question and just because
[37:25] the law was abolished
[37:27] does not mean God wanted us to stop
[37:29] following his
[37:30] Commandments amen the abolishing or the
[37:34] fulfilling of the law the law was
[37:36] fulfilled it was not done away with the
[37:39] Bible says the law is perfect yeah the
[37:42] problem was never the law the problem
[37:43] was always the
[37:45] man all right and so God fulfilled the
[37:48] law but he never changed his desire for
[37:50] man to keep his Commandments but now you
[37:53] can't keep you can't keep his
[37:54] Commandments to redeem yourself you
[37:56] can't keep his Commandments to save
[37:58] yourself he you keep his Commandments
[38:00] because he wants you to keep his
[38:01] Commandments and it benefits you amen
[38:05] amen but God never changed his mind
[38:07] about obeying his voice that he never
[38:10] changed that it's obligatory his word is
[38:13] obligatory and he wants us to obey his
[38:15] voice he gives it for a reason not so
[38:17] that we can decide whether we will or
[38:19] won't keep
[38:20] it right so now we find that when we do
[38:24] leave the word that God has a way of
[38:26] chasing us to bring us back to his word
[38:29] in Proverbs
[38:31] 3:11 it says my son despise not the
[38:34] chastening of the Lord neither be weary
[38:36] of his correction for whom the Lord
[38:38] loveth he corrected even as a Father the
[38:40] Son and whom he delighteth amen what
[38:43] does God do when we leave his
[38:45] commandment and leave his word he
[38:47] correct us who does he correct he
[38:49] corrects the one that he Delights
[38:51] in it's his love and his Delight let's
[38:53] go over to Hebrews 12 now and catch the
[38:55] same thought
[39:03] Hebrews
[39:06] 12 and we're going to read from Hebrews
[39:09] 12 starting at verse
[39:13] 5 Hebrews 12
[39:17] and5 and ye have forgotten the
[39:19] exhortation with speaketh un you as unto
[39:21] children my son despise not thou the
[39:24] chastening of the Lord nor faint when
[39:26] thou art rebuked of him this isn't just
[39:28] the Old Testament it's New Testament now
[39:30] for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth
[39:32] and scourgeth every son whom he
[39:34] receiveth if you endure chastening God
[39:37] dealth with you as with sons for what
[39:39] son is he whom the father chasteneth not
[39:42] but if you be without chastisement where
[39:44] of all our partakers then are you
[39:45] bastards and not Sons furthermore we
[39:48] have had fathers of our flesh which
[39:50] corrected us and he and we gave them
[39:53] reverence shall we not much rather be in
[39:55] subjection unto the the father of
[39:56] spirits and live for they verily for a
[39:59] few days chasen us after their own
[40:01] pleasure but he for our Prophet that we
[40:05] might be partakers of his Holiness now
[40:07] no chastisement for the present seeth to
[40:09] be joyous but Grievous nevertheless
[40:11] afterward it yielded the Peaceable fruit
[40:13] of righteousness unto them which are
[40:16] exercised
[40:17] thereby the chastening of the Lord is
[40:20] the love of
[40:21] God it's his Delight it means you're his
[40:25] special treasure yeah because he knows
[40:28] the only safe place is in his word he
[40:30] knows the only place to be protected
[40:32] from the Ws of the devil from the
[40:34] entrapments of the enemy the only way
[40:36] amen is in his word and when we step out
[40:39] to the right or to the left he's a good
[40:40] shepherd He has a rod and he has a staff
[40:42] he's a father that will bring correction
[40:44] and chastisement and he said don't be
[40:46] weary this is for our good amen this is
[40:48] for our profit he's going to bring us
[40:50] back to the word because then the word
[40:53] is love and the word is peace and the
[40:55] word is protection and the word is
[40:57] everything that we have need of so when
[40:59] we ourselves fail he brings us back to
[41:02] the word brother Bram says in Christ is
[41:05] the mystery of God revealed he he he
[41:07] he's going to share something personal
[41:09] that I thought I found to be amazing
[41:12] says now we come back here to visit the
[41:14] climate in this place I certainly don't
[41:16] like cuz it just breaks me down as soon
[41:19] as I get here I can cross the top of the
[41:21] knobs up there and come down in this
[41:23] Valley and I'm here about 10 minutes and
[41:25] I got hives get sick weather
[41:27] swimmy-headed everything looks spooky
[41:29] dark and I just have to get out of it
[41:31] see and the other day I was talking to
[41:33] the wife but what brings me in first
[41:36] what brings me here as you people see
[41:38] this church I tell you of all the places
[41:40] I ever in my life it all the places I
[41:43] ever went in my life this is my favorite
[41:45] place to come preach the gospel it looks
[41:47] like that we can make a tape from here
[41:49] that's 10 times better than anywhere
[41:50] else see that's the reason I say where
[41:52] God is doing something then stay right
[41:54] with it now catch this part
[41:57] but I think where the great thing is
[41:59] that was me failing to go out at the
[42:01] first time when he called me and
[42:04] therefore he makes it kind of rough on
[42:05] me when I come in obedience is better
[42:08] than
[42:09] sacrifice here's the prophet of God
[42:11] decades after he made a
[42:13] mistake decades later amen God had sent
[42:17] him out into the Pentecostal people when
[42:19] he was in Mich walk come in contact Amen
[42:21] in that conference and he got a a whole
[42:23] pile of invitations around the country
[42:25] and he came back and he let his
[42:27] mother-in-law talk him out of it amen
[42:29] and she criticized him and he backed
[42:30] down and we know the price that Prophet
[42:32] had to pay amen because that Prophet was
[42:35] out of the will of God and out of the
[42:37] word of God because he had a job to do
[42:39] and God brought a chastisement upon his
[42:41] prophet and that Prophet lost his father
[42:44] he lost his brother he lost his daughter
[42:45] and he lost his wife all in a short
[42:48] period of
[42:49] time and now here he is decades later
[42:53] and he's saying every time I come in
[42:54] here this place it's back for my health
[42:57] and I get swimmy-headed I get all this
[42:59] stuff going on Amen and he goes I think
[43:01] the reason is is because he makes it
[43:04] tough on me cuz I didn't go out the
[43:05] first time I said my goodness God had
[43:09] left a reminder amen like a thorn in the
[43:12] flesh of Paul a reminder of why it's
[43:14] always good to obey the voice of God and
[43:18] I don't know about you but that Prophet
[43:19] was left with a reminder I've got some
[43:21] reminders in my life some Pricks in my
[43:23] life that remind me that it's always
[43:26] best to stay with the word of God and
[43:28] God leaving that little prick amen is
[43:30] the grace of God in my life amen so that
[43:33] I remember the next time I come to a y
[43:35] on the road I'm going to take the word
[43:37] regardless of what I feel regardless of
[43:39] what anybody else says because I know
[43:41] the consequences for leaving the
[43:44] word the word is the only
[43:46] way amen so the prophet of God was
[43:51] left was left with
[43:54] this uh uh Thorn I would say irritation
[43:58] this problem because he didn't go out
[44:00] the first
[44:02] time he goes on and he says in the
[44:04] message who is this he said what if
[44:06] somebody sinned maybe they did do
[44:08] something they ought not to have done
[44:10] maybe they ought to have done something
[44:12] they did not do or something on that Ma
[44:14] Manner and here they are God permitting
[44:17] Satan to hold that curse on them to
[44:20] bring them to something to obedience
[44:22] sickness is sometimes is a whip God uses
[44:25] to bring obedience what a thing for the
[44:28] prophet of God to say Amen in in the the
[44:32] age of Grace Amen in the time yeah in
[44:35] the New Testament era that God would
[44:38] still allow Satan to bring a whip to
[44:42] bring us back to
[44:44] obedience that's God's love his tender
[44:48] Mercy his
[44:50] affection his his peculiar watch over
[44:53] his children that's it on display amen
[44:56] amen God is
[44:57] good let's turn to First Corinthians I
[45:00] want to reinforce this with a couple
[45:01] more scriptures before I really get to
[45:03] the heart of what I really want to say 1
[45:06] Corinthians
[45:17] 11 1
[45:19] Corinthians
[45:24] 11:31
[45:27] 1 Corinthians 11:31 for if we would
[45:29] judge ourselves we should not be judged
[45:32] but when we are judged we are chasen to
[45:34] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[45:37] with the world God's not going to let us
[45:40] go he's a good father and he's not going
[45:43] to let us keep transgressing his word
[45:46] without bringing us back into
[45:49] obedience because that's what he wants
[45:51] he wants us to love him and to obey his
[45:55] Commandments
[45:57] let's go to uh Revelation chapter
[46:02] 3 Revelation 3:
[46:12] 19 in
[46:14] Revelation 3:
[46:18] 19 as many as I love I rebuke and chasen
[46:23] be zealous therefore and repent
[46:26] who does he rebuke and chasen as many as
[46:29] he
[46:30] loves this is the love of God he wants
[46:32] us to repent and come back to his
[46:35] word makes this statement in the message
[46:37] influence he says and this young man
[46:39] said well I tell you what I think about
[46:41] God I think that God loves me so much
[46:44] till he'll let me get by with
[46:47] anything this is Grace unto disgrace
[46:51] this is disgraceful
[46:53] Grace he said I believe God loves me so
[46:55] much he let me get by with anything and
[46:58] me sometimes we can take that attitude
[46:59] to the Bride of Jesus Christ oh God
[47:01] loves his bride I'm bride I'm bride but
[47:03] don't think that God won't correct his
[47:05] bride because she has to stay in his
[47:08] command if anybody will love him and
[47:09] keep his Commandments it'll be his bride
[47:11] and if we step to the right or to the
[47:13] left it's his love it's his great love
[47:15] it's his grace amen that'll bring us
[47:17] back in line with his word so we don't
[47:20] want to get that attitude that that I
[47:22] don't need any correction I'm his bride
[47:25] and we think you know sometimes we think
[47:27] well I've come to a level of maturity
[47:28] when the Bride Comes to maturity she
[47:30] doesn't need correction and all this
[47:32] amen that should be true the problem is
[47:34] we all along keep thinking we're uh uh
[47:36] mature right for 40 years we felt like
[47:39] we were mature and now we think we're
[47:41] mature we have no idea where we are on
[47:44] the stratus of
[47:45] maturity we feel like well I've come to
[47:47] maturity and no longer have to be
[47:49] corrected no longer oh come on we're
[47:51] still in Cocker sticky flash we still
[47:54] have a dual nature we still need to come
[47:56] under the word of God and we still need
[47:59] God to correct us and bring us back in
[48:02] lineen sometimes we get fanciful ideas
[48:05] amen but the reality is we're still
[48:07] prone to
[48:10] mistakes so he says I he loves me so
[48:14] much till he'll let me get by with
[48:17] anything I said he never did do that
[48:20] this is Brother brenham's response he
[48:21] never God never loved anybody let him
[48:23] get by with anything he never did do
[48:26] that he never would do it even Israel
[48:28] his Nation even David a man after his
[48:30] own heart reaped every grain that he
[48:32] sowed and you'll do it too each one of
[48:35] us will do that we know
[48:37] that
[48:39] amen praise God I want to turn to 2
[48:43] Samuel and now we're going to start
[48:46] moving into part
[48:49] two and there's a reason we did this and
[48:52] you'll see as we go a little further 2
[49:01] Samuel 2
[49:06] Samuel chapter
[49:21] 7 2 Samuel chap 7 vers vers
[49:26] 12 and when thy days be fulfilled this
[49:29] is speaking to David King David when thy
[49:31] days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep
[49:34] with thy fathers I will set up thy seed
[49:36] after thee which shall proceed out of
[49:38] thy bowels and I will establish his
[49:39] kingdom and he shall build a house for
[49:42] my name and I will establish the Throne
[49:43] of his kingdom forever and I will be his
[49:46] father and he shall be my son if he
[49:48] commit iniquity I will chasten him with
[49:51] the rod of men and with the stripes of
[49:52] the children of men but my Mercy shall
[49:55] not depart away from him as I took it
[49:57] from Saul when I put away before thee
[50:01] and thine house and thy kingdom shall be
[50:03] established forever before thee thy
[50:05] Throne shall be established forever a
[50:08] and thy Throne shall be established
[50:09] forever am mean we know that every
[50:11] scripture has a dual prophecy and when
[50:12] it's speaking of the Throne of David
[50:14] forever it's speaking of the coming of
[50:16] the king of kings the son of David which
[50:17] will be Jesus Christ but it's also
[50:19] speaking of Solomon his son coming to
[50:21] the throne and he says if he commit
[50:23] iniquity I will chasen him with the rod
[50:25] of men I will chase him it says I want
[50:29] to read that again in verse 14 if he
[50:32] commit iniquity I will chasen him with
[50:33] the rod of men and with the stripes of
[50:35] the children of men but my Mercy shall
[50:38] not depart away from him he's making a
[50:40] declaration amen he's saying amen if he
[50:44] he steps out of line if he gets into
[50:46] iniquity I will chasen him I will spank
[50:48] him I will bring him back in line but
[50:50] I'm promising you this David my Mercy
[50:53] will not depart from him oh praise be to
[50:56] God and we know speaking of Solomon did
[50:59] Solomon get out of line yes he got out
[51:01] of line did Solomon blow it yes he blew
[51:03] it Solomon had so many wives and
[51:05] Disobedience to the Commandment of God
[51:07] he he brought to him an abundance of
[51:09] wives and those wives LED his heart
[51:11] astray and he went to worshiped other
[51:13] gods amen the end of his life was
[51:14] disgraceful but you see God kept his
[51:16] word he never removed his Mercy from
[51:19] Solomon and brother brandham said and a
[51:22] man is a failure to begin with
[51:26] I don't care who he is Solomon was the
[51:28] wisest man that ever walked the face of
[51:30] the Earth to that time amen and and he
[51:32] knew all kinds of things but Solomon was
[51:35] a failure to begin
[51:38] with I don't care who he is he is born
[51:41] in sin shaped in iniquity come to the
[51:43] world speaking lies so he's a total
[51:47] failure oh praise God I'm glad he said
[51:50] that let's go to psalms now Psalms 6 86
[51:55] I'm sorry sorry Psalms
[52:08] 86 Psalms 86 verse1
[52:13] 15 but thou oh Lord art a God full of
[52:18] compassion and gracious longsuffering
[52:20] and plenteous in Mercy and
[52:24] Truth now I'm going to give you my
[52:26] second title is that
[52:29] okay first title is Deliverance is first
[52:32] found in the commandment and I hope we
[52:35] can all say that that's the truth if
[52:38] Adam and Eve would have never
[52:39] transgressed God law there would have
[52:40] never been any need for anything else
[52:43] they had
[52:44] everything amen the the word of God is
[52:48] obligatory we're supposed to keep it
[52:51] it's not
[52:52] optional I hope we can get it's not
[52:54] option it's not based on how I feel I
[52:56] don't feel like keeping today I feel no
[52:58] it's
[52:59] obligatory God said if you Jesus said if
[53:01] you love me keep my Commandments if you
[53:03] love me not you won't keep my
[53:04] Commandments it's a clear
[53:07] delineation all right so we understand
[53:10] that the word of God is obligatory to
[53:12] the children of God and God's always
[53:13] been looking for somebody that obey his
[53:15] voice so the the the God's word is our
[53:18] protection God's word is our wall God's
[53:20] word is our Safety and Security we
[53:22] understand that and we know that's true
[53:23] so Deliverance is first found in the
[53:25] commandment but today I'd like to talk
[53:27] about Deliverance is finally found where
[53:29] do you finally find Deliverance
[53:31] Deliverance is finally found in grace
[53:33] and
[53:34] mercy why is Deliverance finally found
[53:37] in grace and mercy because man is a
[53:38] failure to begin with he's born in sin
[53:40] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[53:42] speaking lies and every one of us has
[53:45] fallen away every one of us has failed
[53:47] to keep the Commandments every one of us
[53:49] have transgressed the laws of God and
[53:51] the only way that we're going to find
[53:52] Deliverance now is by his grace and
[53:54] mercy
[53:56] Mercy that's where we finally find
[53:59] Deliverance because we fall we fail amen
[54:02] if we would have never left the word we
[54:03] would have never needed anything else
[54:05] the problem is every one of us have left
[54:07] the word and continue to do so so the
[54:11] final place of Deliverance is grace and
[54:14] mercy now this truth doesn't take away
[54:17] from the first truth it always remains
[54:19] true God wants us to obey and obedience
[54:22] is Safety and Security and obedience is
[54:24] where God wants us to be but there's the
[54:27] the second does not diminish the first
[54:29] and the first does not diminish the
[54:31] second both of these things are
[54:33] simultaneously
[54:35] true that's why I told you Wednesday was
[54:37] an incomplete
[54:39] thought because we get out on a limb so
[54:42] far and realize brother Chad you're
[54:44] right amen that's the truth that's the
[54:46] truth that's the truth but what do I do
[54:48] now what do I do my marriage is now in
[54:50] trouble now I'm addicted now I've got
[54:52] problems now I have needs now I've
[54:54] wrecked my body body now I've wrecked my
[54:56] health now I've wrecked my mind what do
[54:57] I do now amen I've missed the first
[55:00] opportunity for deliverance is there any
[55:02] Deliverance for me and the answer is
[55:04] absolutely there's Deliverance for you
[55:06] because the final place of his
[55:07] Deliverance is in his grace and mercy
[55:10] he's abundant in Mercy he's abundant in
[55:12] Grace he's longsuffering and patient and
[55:16] kind is he a father who chasen you yes
[55:19] but that's his kindness and love will he
[55:21] keep will he make you keep his word will
[55:23] he correct you when you come outside of
[55:24] his word absolutely that's his love and
[55:27] grace but finally where will I find
[55:29] Deliverance I will find it in his grace
[55:31] and
[55:32] mercy let's go to Exodus
[55:45] 34 Exodus
[55:48] 34 Verse
[55:54] five this
[55:56] is in The Exodus Journey he's still
[55:59] speaking to Israel Exodus 34:5 through
[56:02] Moses and he says and the Lord descended
[56:04] in the cloud and stood with him there
[56:07] and proclaimed the name of the Lord and
[56:09] the Lord passed by before him this is
[56:11] before Moses and proclaimed the Lord the
[56:14] Lord God merciful and
[56:17] gracious this is he's passing before
[56:20] Moses and he's giving Moses an
[56:23] understanding of who he is this is his
[56:26] introduction amen the Lord the Lord God
[56:29] merciful and gracious longsuffering and
[56:32] abundant in goodness and
[56:35] truth that's who our God is amen that's
[56:38] who this Lord is that come down on SI
[56:40] this is who he was to the children of
[56:42] Israel and he was this Lord who is
[56:44] merciful and goodness and longsuffering
[56:47] and full of Truth he said if you'll obey
[56:49] my voice you'll be a peculiar treasure
[56:51] above all
[56:53] people amen that was his grace and his
[56:58] Mercy let's go quickly to
[57:01] Joel through the Book of
[57:04] Joel I'm sorry we're flipping a lot but
[57:06] I just want to lay this Foundation
[57:11] down I like flipping through the Bible
[57:15] does me
[57:16] good all right
[57:18] Joel chapter 2 Joel chapter
[57:22] 2 and we're going to read from verse 12
[57:28] Joel
[57:30] 2:2 therefore also no no sayith the Lord
[57:34] turn ye even to me with all your heart
[57:37] and with fasting and with weeping and
[57:39] with mourning and Rend your heart and
[57:42] not your garments this I love this I I
[57:45] just just stay with me in this Rend your
[57:48] heart and not your garments amen you
[57:51] know why because when an apostasy would
[57:53] come when tragedy would strike amen when
[57:56] when the armies would gather around so
[57:57] often in their anguish and grief and the
[57:59] show their distress they would rip their
[58:01] garment it was very symbolic and tearing
[58:03] of the Garment amen but but but God is
[58:06] telling his people don't just go through
[58:08] the motions don't just outwardly display
[58:12] ringe your heart not your
[58:14] garment when you get into distress when
[58:17] you get into trouble when you when you
[58:19] call on the name of the Lord when you
[58:20] need Deliverance don't just Rend your
[58:23] garment Rend your heart
[58:25] Rend your heart and not your garment and
[58:27] turn unto the Lord your God for he is
[58:29] gracious and merciful slow to anger and
[58:32] of great kindness and repenteth him of
[58:35] the evil oh what do I do amen I I must
[58:40] come back to God in Repentance and come
[58:42] back to his word amen when the
[58:43] chastening of the Lord comes down what's
[58:46] he trying to do he's trying to drive me
[58:48] back to the word back to the Commandment
[58:51] back to where I can abide in his love
[58:55] and be a peculiar treasure to him above
[58:58] all the peoples of the Earth but what do
[59:00] I have to do I have to come back and
[59:03] Rend my
[59:05] heart Daniel does this let's go to
[59:08] Daniel The Book of
[59:10] Daniel just a little bit couple books to
[59:12] the
[59:13] left Daniel chapter
[59:20] n this is a long prayer but I'm just
[59:22] going to read a couple segments out of
[59:23] it and Daniel now is praying and seeking
[59:26] the Lord in chapter 9 Daniel chapter
[59:30] 9 and verse
[59:32] 4 and I prayed unto the Lord my God and
[59:35] made my confession and said oh Lord the
[59:38] great and Dreadful God keeping the
[59:40] Covenant and mercy to them that love him
[59:43] to them that keep his
[59:44] Commandments we have sinned and have
[59:47] committed
[59:48] iniquity what a good first
[59:51] step it God is so gracious and God Is So
[59:56] merciful that he calls us back to
[59:58] himself but when we come back to him I
[1:00:01] mean we're not to come back and act like
[1:00:03] nothing
[1:00:04] happened like we didn't transgress as
[1:00:06] law like we didn't do anything wrong we
[1:00:08] just step back in like well I I got out
[1:00:10] here and CR I'm back here and yeah
[1:00:12] everything's fine no look at look at the
[1:00:16] attitude this is what is so important
[1:00:18] amen he says we have sinned and have
[1:00:21] committed iniquity and have done
[1:00:24] wickedly and have rebelled even by
[1:00:26] departing from thy precepts and from thy
[1:00:28] judgments neither have we hearkened unto
[1:00:31] the servants and the the the prophets
[1:00:33] which spake in the name in thy name to
[1:00:35] our Kings our princes our fathers and to
[1:00:37] all the people of the land oh Lord
[1:00:40] righteousness belongeth unto thee but
[1:00:42] unto us confusion of faces what Daniel
[1:00:46] saying righteousness belongs to you but
[1:00:49] we're getting what we
[1:00:52] deserve as at that day
[1:00:55] as at this day to the men of Judah and
[1:00:57] to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to
[1:00:59] all Israel that are near and that are
[1:01:01] far off though all the country
[1:01:03] throughout through all the countries
[1:01:04] whether thou has driven them because
[1:01:06] they they their trespassed that they
[1:01:09] have trespassed against thee Oh Lord to
[1:01:12] us belongeth confusion of Faith to our
[1:01:14] Kings to our princes to our fathers
[1:01:16] because we have sinned against thee to
[1:01:19] the Lord Our God belongeth mercy and
[1:01:21] forgiveness though we have rebelled
[1:01:23] against him
[1:01:25] you know what he's saying God this isn't
[1:01:27] your
[1:01:30] fault you gave us your prophets you gave
[1:01:32] us your word you gave us your
[1:01:34] Commandments and we didn't listen and we
[1:01:36] strayed away and we forsook you amen you
[1:01:39] deserve right unto you is righteousness
[1:01:41] unto us is confusion of faith we deserve
[1:01:43] what we get but love and mercy is with
[1:01:45] you you were never wrong you were never
[1:01:48] out of line you never treated us bad you
[1:01:51] never failed me you never failed them
[1:01:53] Daniel is saying mercy and forgiveness
[1:01:55] has always been with you righteousness
[1:01:57] has always been with you the problem is
[1:01:59] not with you the problem is with
[1:02:01] us we left your word we disobeyed we
[1:02:04] transgressed we didn't hear your
[1:02:06] prophets we did our Kings didn't hear
[1:02:08] our leaders didn't hear and now we're
[1:02:10] getting what we
[1:02:12] deserve this is what Daniel's crying to
[1:02:15] the
[1:02:16] Lord he says I'm going to read verse 10
[1:02:19] again neither have we obeyed the voice
[1:02:20] of the Lord Our God to walk in his
[1:02:22] laws which he said set before us by his
[1:02:26] servants the prophets y all Israel have
[1:02:28] transgressed thy law even by departing
[1:02:30] that they might not obey the V thy voice
[1:02:33] therefore the curse is poured out upon
[1:02:35] us and the oath that is written in the
[1:02:37] law of Moses the servant of God because
[1:02:39] we have sinned against
[1:02:41] him praise be to God let's scroll down
[1:02:46] this is verse 16 let's let's pick it up
[1:02:48] again in
[1:02:49] 16 oh Lord according to all thy
[1:02:52] righteousness I beseech thee thee let
[1:02:55] thine anger and thy Fury be turned away
[1:02:57] from thy City Jerusalem thy Holy
[1:02:59] Mountain because for our sins and for
[1:03:01] for the iniquities of our fathers
[1:03:03] Jerusalem and thy people are become a
[1:03:05] reproach to all that are about us now
[1:03:08] therefore Oh Our God hear the prayer of
[1:03:11] thy servant and his supplications and
[1:03:13] cause thy face to shine upon thy
[1:03:15] Sanctuary that is desolate for the
[1:03:17] Lord's sake oh my God incline thine ear
[1:03:21] and hear open thine eyes and behold our
[1:03:23] desol ations in the city which is called
[1:03:26] by thy name for we do not present our
[1:03:28] supplications before thee for our
[1:03:30] righteousness but for thy great
[1:03:33] mercies oh Lord hear oh Lord forgive oh
[1:03:36] Lord hearken and do defer not for thine
[1:03:38] own sake oh my God for the city and thy
[1:03:41] people are called by thy
[1:03:44] name I love Daniel's prayer Daniel's
[1:03:47] prayer is so honest it's so true God we
[1:03:52] failed you you you know God never failed
[1:03:55] through the church ages that wasn't
[1:03:57] God's failure that was our failure we
[1:03:59] can stand like Daniel Daniel Daniel
[1:04:02] wasn't there 300 years before Daniel
[1:04:04] wasn't there a thousand years before but
[1:04:06] Daniel was placing himself in the same
[1:04:08] lump amen he's saying God we failed you
[1:04:11] we didn't listen to your problem he
[1:04:12] wasn't even there that day that they
[1:04:13] didn't listen but he's putting himself
[1:04:15] in the same spot and I think we can do
[1:04:17] the same thing God your people this
[1:04:19] bride amen your church has failed you
[1:04:21] amen we failed to keep the apostles word
[1:04:24] we failed to keep the New Testament
[1:04:26] order we failed we failed we failed we
[1:04:30] failed but oh God restore us according
[1:04:33] to your mercy restore us according to
[1:04:35] your righteousness for we're the people
[1:04:36] called by your name not for our sakes
[1:04:39] cuz we're a failure but for your sake
[1:04:41] for your name For Your Glory would you
[1:04:43] heal us will you strengthen us will you
[1:04:45] bring us back in line with your word God
[1:04:47] has done that in that this day this is
[1:04:49] the day we live in amen we should be GL
[1:04:51] we should glorify God because his Mercy
[1:04:54] Mercy brought his word back to us his
[1:04:56] grace has reestablished the truth when
[1:04:58] it was lost because of our failure his
[1:05:01] Mercy his grace his great righteousness
[1:05:03] has brought the word
[1:05:05] back amen they went back to Israel when
[1:05:09] they turned their hearts back to God and
[1:05:11] they confessed their sins and repented
[1:05:13] and had a desire to come back to the
[1:05:15] word God in his graciousness according
[1:05:17] to his promise brought them back to
[1:05:19] Israel to reestablish Jerusalem and to
[1:05:21] build back the temple amen not because
[1:05:23] they were good because he was
[1:05:27] good and he was going to keep his word
[1:05:30] when they were ready to come back to his
[1:05:31] word he brought him back to the
[1:05:33] word oh if we're ready to come back to
[1:05:36] his word he'll bring us back to his word
[1:05:40] amen praise God let's go to
[1:05:43] Lamentations we're going everywhere
[1:05:48] friends Lamentations is after
[1:05:52] Jeremiah written written by
[1:05:56] Jeremiah because Lamentations is about
[1:05:59] the destruction and casting away of
[1:06:01] Israel Jeremiah receives the prophecy
[1:06:04] that they're going to be sent away
[1:06:06] they're going to become captives of
[1:06:07] Babylon for 70 years there's a
[1:06:10] destruction and desolation coming to
[1:06:12] Jerusalem because they forso the law of
[1:06:13] the Lord because they didn't love the
[1:06:16] lord they're being Cast
[1:06:20] Away and in Lamentations is Jeremiah
[1:06:23] weeping over the Desolation that's
[1:06:25] coming and God actually tells Jeremiah
[1:06:29] Don't Pray for
[1:06:30] Jerusalem amen their iniquity had come
[1:06:33] to a fullness judgment had to come
[1:06:34] according to his word and he's actually
[1:06:36] telling Jeremiah Don't intercede anymore
[1:06:38] for it amen because I'll have to listen
[1:06:40] to you right because you're part of me
[1:06:44] right so he says don't pray for
[1:06:46] Jerusalem so now he's lamenting amen
[1:06:48] over what what's going to happen and in
[1:06:51] Lamentations 3 verse 21 1 this is what
[1:06:55] he says limitations
[1:07:00] 321 this I recall to my mind therefore
[1:07:03] have I
[1:07:04] hope it is of the Lord's mercies that we
[1:07:07] are not consumed because his compassions
[1:07:09] fail not he said in my Lamentations I
[1:07:12] recall a mind I recall this to my mind I
[1:07:15] remembered
[1:07:17] something God doesn't just chasen God
[1:07:20] also
[1:07:21] heals God doesn't just chasen but he
[1:07:24] restores I this I recall to my mind
[1:07:27] therefore have I hope it is of the
[1:07:29] Lord's mercies that we are not consumed
[1:07:31] because his compassions fail not they
[1:07:33] are new every morning great is thy
[1:07:37] faithfulness this is how he's
[1:07:39] encouraging himself in the time amen of
[1:07:41] their chastisement for their Rebellion
[1:07:44] he says I remembered something I
[1:07:46] remembered amen greater his
[1:07:48] mercies oh I remember the Lord's mercies
[1:07:51] it's his mercies that were not consumed
[1:07:53] because because his compassion doesn't
[1:07:55] fail they are new every morning great is
[1:07:59] thy faithfulness what's he looking at
[1:08:02] he's not looking at himself now he's not
[1:08:04] even looking at the chastisement which
[1:08:05] is due and which is just and which must
[1:08:08] come to pass he's looking beyond that
[1:08:10] that God is a merciful god he's a
[1:08:12] forgiving God he's a longsuffering God
[1:08:15] and he's not going to utterly cast us
[1:08:19] away amen let's go to verse
[1:08:22] 31
[1:08:24] for the Lord will not cast off
[1:08:28] forever but though he cause grief that's
[1:08:32] the
[1:08:32] spanking though he cause grief yet will
[1:08:36] he have compassion according to the
[1:08:38] multitude of his
[1:08:40] mercies though he will chasten though he
[1:08:42] will cause grief he I love this word but
[1:08:46] though he cause grief yet will he have
[1:08:48] compassion even in the chastisement he
[1:08:51] will have compassion
[1:08:54] according to the multitude of his
[1:08:59] mercies I'm so
[1:09:03] thankful you know what I don't
[1:09:07] deserve
[1:09:11] anything you know what I deserve death
[1:09:14] and destruction and
[1:09:16] torment amen why because I transgressed
[1:09:19] his laws you say oh brother Chad you
[1:09:21] were ignant no I did it when I knew
[1:09:23] better
[1:09:24] not in ignorance and willful
[1:09:26] Disobedience friends I hate that I'm
[1:09:28] ashamed to say that to you but it's
[1:09:30] absolutely the truth I have not always
[1:09:32] got it right I still don't always get it
[1:09:34] right there's times that I fail God Amen
[1:09:36] there's times I take an attitude
[1:09:38] something pops out of my mouth I say
[1:09:39] something I shouldn't say and I know
[1:09:41] it's
[1:09:42] wrong amen none of us can claim to have
[1:09:44] arrived and we're no longer of any
[1:09:46] failure whatsoever and we come to
[1:09:48] Perfection but oh God great is thy
[1:09:51] mercies Great Is Thy Faithfulness th
[1:09:53] Mercy is Everlasting amen and it shall
[1:09:56] not
[1:09:57] fail that's what I'm imploring I'm not
[1:09:59] imploring my goodness I'm not imploring
[1:10:01] my greatness I can't oh God you know I
[1:10:03] believe your word I only believe his
[1:10:05] word because he put something in me to
[1:10:07] believe with not because of my brain or
[1:10:10] my willpower I've no it's all God's
[1:10:13] grace in my life and now I'm not
[1:10:15] standing imploring him by favor for
[1:10:17] anything that I have done of any
[1:10:19] righteousness but all I can say is God
[1:10:21] you're faithful your mercies are new
[1:10:23] every morning your compassion faileth
[1:10:25] not oh God would you have compassion and
[1:10:28] mercy on me cuz I deserve uh confusion
[1:10:31] of face I deserve to be Cast Away like
[1:10:34] your nation of Israel but oh God just
[1:10:36] like you reather them will you reather
[1:10:45] me praise
[1:10:51] God I was thinking
[1:10:54] while I was meditating on this I was
[1:10:58] thinking about little Henry our grandson
[1:11:02] and he's learning so many things for the
[1:11:03] first time he's learning what to touch
[1:11:06] what not to touch what the boundaries
[1:11:08] are that right and his parents are
[1:11:12] giving him
[1:11:13] Commandments and their Commandments are
[1:11:15] not
[1:11:16] Grievious but their
[1:11:19] life to keep him safe to keep him from
[1:11:23] harm yeah to keep him out of
[1:11:25] danger right and I'm sure that his mama
[1:11:28] would love to say sometimes if you love
[1:11:30] me just keep my
[1:11:32] Commandments cuz toddlers are tough if
[1:11:36] you love me just keep my
[1:11:38] Commandments I remember one time when
[1:11:40] David was itty bitty we were riding a
[1:11:44] ski lift we were up in obber Gatlinburg
[1:11:46] we took the tram up Angie's pretty
[1:11:48] afraid of heights we took the tram up
[1:11:50] she survived the tram but then we were
[1:11:52] going to ride the Alpine Slide the
[1:11:54] little scooter thing going down the
[1:11:55] mountain and and the first time up the
[1:11:57] little it's just a little bitty ski lift
[1:11:59] to get up and ride it down first time up
[1:12:01] David was sitting with Angie well
[1:12:03] Angie's afraid of heights David has zero
[1:12:05] fear of
[1:12:06] heights so you can imagine what that
[1:12:08] ride was
[1:12:09] like it she felt like she was riding on
[1:12:12] the ski lift with a
[1:12:14] squirrel he was leaning over the edge he
[1:12:17] was turned around waving at us he said
[1:12:19] mom look at this and and the whole
[1:12:20] thing's rocking and
[1:12:22] swaying so she took his little t-shirt
[1:12:25] he's probably five or six years old she
[1:12:26] took his T-shirt and she wound it around
[1:12:28] his hand like the her hand and she said
[1:12:31] David if you love me at all you will sit
[1:12:36] still if you love me even a little bit
[1:12:40] you won't
[1:12:42] move if you love me keep my
[1:12:45] Commandments we got down to the bottom
[1:12:47] of the hill and David comes over to me
[1:12:49] dad can I ride with you mom won't let me
[1:12:51] won't let me move
[1:12:58] but I'm sure with little Henry they
[1:13:00] would love to say if you love me just
[1:13:02] keep my it's for your good I haven't
[1:13:03] told you anything to hurt you I haven't
[1:13:05] done anything to harm you I haven't
[1:13:07] given any commandment to to prevent you
[1:13:09] from life to keep you from
[1:13:12] fun God allows us to be parents so we
[1:13:15] can learn a few
[1:13:18] things you know and I'm I'm watching
[1:13:22] this whole play on I'm just remembering
[1:13:23] raising children and we've got a wood
[1:13:26] burning fireplace and Henry knows that
[1:13:28] it's hot he knows what hot means he
[1:13:29] comes over say hot he knows not to touch
[1:13:31] it but it'll get close and he'll try and
[1:13:34] and you just think about a little
[1:13:35] toddler amen that that they they've got
[1:13:39] that they've got that I just can't help
[1:13:42] but say it sinful nature yeah right they
[1:13:45] just got to push the barrier they just
[1:13:47] got to go beyond the command yeah
[1:13:52] right
[1:13:53] and so they'll say don't touch he'll
[1:13:56] move closer stick out his hand don't
[1:13:57] touch then there comes a correction amen
[1:13:59] a rod of Correction and all of a sudden
[1:14:01] his little life is ruined and mom hates
[1:14:03] me and dad doesn't want me to have any
[1:14:04] fun this is the worst thing I've ever
[1:14:06] lived through in all my life and they
[1:14:07] have no idea this is love this is Mercy
[1:14:12] this is
[1:14:14] Grace but you know what we all know as
[1:14:16] parents I know it as a grandparent
[1:14:18] watching I know beyond a shadow of a
[1:14:20] doubt one day he's going to touch it
[1:14:24] is there any child who
[1:14:28] hasn't I know he's going to touch it
[1:14:31] right I know there's going to come a day
[1:14:33] when we're not watchful enough when when
[1:14:35] he's got a little bit of a head
[1:14:38] start he's going to touch it it's going
[1:14:41] to hurt it's going to be painful but I
[1:14:44] also know he's not going to die it's not
[1:14:46] going to be life-threatening it's not
[1:14:49] going to be
[1:14:50] permanent but I also know that when when
[1:14:53] he touches it he'll understand the grace
[1:14:56] and mercy that's found in the
[1:14:58] Commandments amen yeah this is life
[1:15:01] friends yeah this is the way we go you
[1:15:04] know it's going to happen you know he's
[1:15:06] going to touch it and you know the
[1:15:08] moment he touches it he's going to
[1:15:10] realize mom loves
[1:15:13] me and her commandment was for my good
[1:15:17] amen not for my
[1:15:22] harm brother BM says in the message
[1:15:24] Fellowship he said in closing I might
[1:15:26] say this in the Garden of Eden when God
[1:15:29] saw that his children had sinned and
[1:15:30] gone from him God himself who is the
[1:15:33] Supreme judge made a Reconciliation so
[1:15:36] he could restore that Fellowship to his
[1:15:38] creatures by the shed blood of an
[1:15:41] animal he goes on in the message
[1:15:43] Perfection he says now when God seen
[1:15:45] that his children had transgressed his
[1:15:47] law and that they must die the
[1:15:50] death then Sovereign Love stepped in to
[1:15:54] make a
[1:15:55] way what did they do they transgress the
[1:15:58] law did they know better yes did he tell
[1:16:00] them ahead of time yes should they have
[1:16:02] done it
[1:16:05] no but when they
[1:16:07] did when they did look at his
[1:16:12] reaction he comes on the scene and
[1:16:14] provides a
[1:16:15] substitute so he could keep them in
[1:16:17] Fellowship did they suffer yes we are
[1:16:20] still suffering from the consequences of
[1:16:22] disobeying the word but although he
[1:16:24] didn't remove the suffering amen he came
[1:16:27] down amen and he made an atonement so
[1:16:29] that he can keep the
[1:16:32] fellowship then Sovereign Love stepped
[1:16:34] in to make a way for God seen that these
[1:16:36] children was to be absolutely totally
[1:16:39] annihilated from his presence there was
[1:16:42] nothing else to be done for they had
[1:16:43] transgressed his law and the penalty of
[1:16:45] his law was
[1:16:47] death and then love of God went out for
[1:16:50] his subjects what was it it was his love
[1:16:53] it was his love that gave him the
[1:16:54] Commandment but when they failed it was
[1:16:56] his love that restored the fellowship it
[1:16:58] was all his love
[1:17:00] yeah they needed deliverance from what
[1:17:03] they needed deliverance from Eternal
[1:17:05] separation they needed a deliverance
[1:17:07] from separation from The Fellowship Of
[1:17:08] God Amen what did they need they needed
[1:17:10] the Deliverance the Deliverance was
[1:17:12] first found in the Commandment if they
[1:17:14] would have kept that commandment they
[1:17:15] would never be in need and Genesis 3
[1:17:17] amen but now they find themselves in
[1:17:19] need and now their Deliverance is found
[1:17:21] in the mercy and Gra of God and he comes
[1:17:25] on the scene and does for them what they
[1:17:27] cannot do for themselves and then love
[1:17:30] of God went out for his subjects and
[1:17:31] when Divine love is projected Sovereign
[1:17:34] Grace produces the object of the love
[1:17:38] and God by forn knowledge when he loved
[1:17:40] this his race so well yet with the
[1:17:42] penalty he caused a substitutionary
[1:17:45] death to take place in the Garden of
[1:17:47] Eden that was he substituted an innocent
[1:17:50] creature a little lamb that know no sin
[1:17:54] and it went for a substitute to work and
[1:17:56] to die in the stead of his guilty Sinner
[1:17:58] and it was a lamb slain to hold the life
[1:18:01] of his
[1:18:02] subjects I'd like for you to turn with
[1:18:04] me to Revelation chapter
[1:18:13] 13 Revelation chap
[1:18:21] 13 verse 8
[1:18:27] Revelation 13 and8 and all that dwell
[1:18:30] upon the Earth shall worship Him whose
[1:18:31] names are not written in the Book of
[1:18:33] Life of the lamb slain from the
[1:18:36] foundation of the
[1:18:41] world God that means god in his mind had
[1:18:44] a land slain from before the foundation
[1:18:46] of the world he also had a
[1:18:49] book and is The Book of Life and part
[1:18:52] part of that is the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:18:54] the record of the elect and God had
[1:18:56] assembled that before the foundation of
[1:18:59] the world and before the foundation of
[1:19:01] the world he already had a Plan of
[1:19:03] Redemption and he already had himself
[1:19:06] coming as a son to be the sacrifice to
[1:19:09] atone for the sins of his
[1:19:11] children already you know what he knew
[1:19:15] he knew they were going to touch the
[1:19:19] stove he knew they were going to do it
[1:19:22] he knew it was going to happen he told
[1:19:24] him not to because that's his grace and
[1:19:26] his
[1:19:28] Mercy but he knew that they would
[1:19:32] eventually someday they're going to
[1:19:34] touch the
[1:19:35] stove so he already made a provision for
[1:19:39] the day that would
[1:19:43] happen his love gave the Commandment but
[1:19:45] before the Commandment his love already
[1:19:48] made a way of redemption and
[1:19:50] Reconciliation this is his Mercy this is
[1:19:52] is his grace that's why Deliverance is
[1:19:55] finally found in Mercy and
[1:19:58] [Music]
[1:20:01] Grace you know what happens
[1:20:04] now when little Henry touches the
[1:20:08] stove this is I Marvel how predictable
[1:20:13] human nature is
[1:20:16] sometimes Henry will receive the
[1:20:18] Commandment from a loving mother and a
[1:20:20] loving father who wants him to be safe
[1:20:22] and protected
[1:20:24] did and if you keep my commandment you
[1:20:27] abide in my love and nothing will hurt
[1:20:30] you but Human Nature has to push the
[1:20:33] boundaries and now the thing that he's
[1:20:35] told not to touch is the only thing in
[1:20:38] the world he wants to
[1:20:39] touch he can have toys littered the
[1:20:42] floor he can have $1,000 worth of toys
[1:20:44] on the floor and he doesn't want to
[1:20:46] touch any of them the only thing he
[1:20:48] wants to touch is the thing he's not
[1:20:49] supposed to
[1:20:51] touch we are the same
[1:20:55] way we think we're not but we are this
[1:20:58] is human nature
[1:21:01] right he told David I gave you wives I
[1:21:04] gave you land if you wanted more wives I
[1:21:06] would have given you more wives but you
[1:21:08] had to go and touch somebody else's wife
[1:21:10] the one I said don't touch if you wanted
[1:21:12] another wife I'd to give you another
[1:21:14] wife
[1:21:16] yeah but you had to go and touch the one
[1:21:19] that I said don't
[1:21:21] touch
[1:21:25] yeah floor littered yeah and all he
[1:21:27] wants to do is touch
[1:21:29] it and when he goes to touch it Mama
[1:21:32] corrects him and he and arches his back
[1:21:35] and throws himself on the floor and is
[1:21:37] unfairly treated and misunderstood and
[1:21:39] nobody loves
[1:21:43] him why is this happening to me you know
[1:21:46] if you're a Christian you don't get away
[1:21:47] with
[1:21:49] anything the rod of God is Mercy and
[1:21:51] Grace
[1:21:53] why is this happening to me why I'm in
[1:21:54] so much trouble why won't the car start
[1:21:56] and then why I won't this and then why
[1:21:57] this and why that amen just ask God God
[1:22:00] is there anything that you want me to do
[1:22:02] differently than what I'm doing that
[1:22:04] doesn't mean every trial is chastisement
[1:22:06] but it's a good time to ask a question
[1:22:08] at
[1:22:10] least so you know what he'll do he'll go
[1:22:14] move towards the little fireplace and
[1:22:16] and he'll put his hand out and he'll
[1:22:18] look over his shoulder see if anybody's
[1:22:21] looking and Mom and Dad will say
[1:22:25] no then all of a sudden if he's got
[1:22:27] enough room enough head star or nobody's
[1:22:29] looking he'll move and if Mama comes off
[1:22:32] the couch to go get him or daddy comes
[1:22:33] off you know what he'll do he'll run
[1:22:35] away from the very
[1:22:37] lifegiver yeah that has given him
[1:22:41] life so that he could fulfill a lustful
[1:22:43] desire yeah he'll run and he'll touch
[1:22:48] the stove the thing is heart craved the
[1:22:51] one thing he wanted to experience to
[1:22:52] know what it was like for himself yeah
[1:22:55] and the moment he has the experience he
[1:22:58] regrets it right how many times that has
[1:23:01] happened to you and I run from the very
[1:23:04] thing we're not to have amen David was
[1:23:07] not supposed to touch Bas Sheba but I
[1:23:08] believe the moment he was done
[1:23:10] fulfilling his lustful desire he
[1:23:12] regretted calling her into his his
[1:23:15] Palace
[1:23:17] right but guess what you know what's
[1:23:20] going to happen to little Henry CU he's
[1:23:23] not already callous and he's not already
[1:23:25] tainted by the world and he doesn't have
[1:23:27] hypocrisy and he doesn't try to look
[1:23:29] good you know what's going to happen to
[1:23:30] him the minute he touches that and feels
[1:23:33] the pain he's going to run back to Mama
[1:23:34] run back to Daddy throw himself in their
[1:23:37] arms crying in pain and you know what
[1:23:39] Mama and Daddy's going to do they're
[1:23:41] going to have mercy and love and grace
[1:23:44] for little Henry he's not going to get a
[1:23:46] whiping he's not going to get
[1:23:47] chastisement he's not going to be told I
[1:23:49] told you you know what he's going to do
[1:23:50] he's going to get ointment he's going to
[1:23:51] get uh he's going going to get whatever
[1:23:53] can soothe whatever can Comfort whatever
[1:23:55] can take away the pain he's going to get
[1:23:57] kisses and he's going to get hugs
[1:24:05] and see if we would just stop being
[1:24:08] proud and arrogant and try to save face
[1:24:11] but when we would just go and touch the
[1:24:13] stove or do whatever if we would just
[1:24:15] run back to God and throw ourselves in
[1:24:17] our arms and say God I've hurt myself
[1:24:19] again I've damaged myself I've hurt my
[1:24:21] family God would you you save me would
[1:24:23] you forgive me would you cleanse me oh
[1:24:25] God have mercy on me God would you
[1:24:28] embrace me again would you would you
[1:24:30] tell me it's going to be okay once again
[1:24:33] and guess what Henry may hurt for a
[1:24:35] little while it may sting for a few days
[1:24:37] he may get a little blister he may have
[1:24:39] something go on like that but by the
[1:24:41] grace of God he'll know that Mama's
[1:24:44] commandment is love Daddy meant love and
[1:24:46] where do I find love after I failed
[1:24:49] right back at the first place I Found
[1:24:51] Love and got the command in the first
[1:24:54] place because it's all God's love and
[1:24:58] grace and mercy his commandment and also
[1:25:01] his restoration his Mercy his grace and
[1:25:03] his forgiveness it's all his love amen
[1:25:06] for his
[1:25:08] children oh I wish we could be more like
[1:25:12] children not have to act like we didn't
[1:25:15] touch the
[1:25:16] stove we'll go over here and Sizzle our
[1:25:20] fingers and everybody sees the smoke
[1:25:22] coming off your
[1:25:24] hand that's the truth friends we can all
[1:25:27] tell when everything's disjointed and
[1:25:29] somebody's out of s you can see it we'll
[1:25:31] put our hand in our pocket and go away
[1:25:34] and we're hurting like
[1:25:38] crazy but we don't want anybody to know
[1:25:40] what we just
[1:25:41] did try to hide it from others try to
[1:25:44] hide it from
[1:25:45] God right when what we need to do is say
[1:25:49] I just transgress the word of God and I
[1:25:51] hurt myself
[1:25:56] I need comfort I need love I need
[1:25:58] healing I need restoration yeah where
[1:26:01] are you going to find it if you don't
[1:26:02] get it from the body of Christ
[1:26:05] amen why can't we just come to
[1:26:09] Christ in his body and say I hurt myself
[1:26:15] again why can't we find love and mercy
[1:26:18] and compassion and
[1:26:21] Grace in God's provided way yeah am the
[1:26:26] very one who gives the Commandment is
[1:26:27] the very one who
[1:26:29] restores because it's God's
[1:26:32] love brother B said when his love
[1:26:34] projected his feeling Christ stepped out
[1:26:37] to take his place it required something
[1:26:40] to take the place his love alone went
[1:26:42] for you and Grace provided a sacrifice
[1:26:46] for you you know what Grace provided you
[1:26:49] know what love provided first a
[1:26:50] commandment yes
[1:26:54] but you know what grace and mercy also
[1:26:55] provided a sacrifice for when you
[1:26:59] transgress the
[1:27:00] commandment and when did God have the
[1:27:02] sacrifice he had the sacrifice before he
[1:27:05] gave the
[1:27:06] Commandment
[1:27:08] amen this is God's love yeah let's turn
[1:27:11] to Isaiah
[1:27:21] 53
[1:27:29] you know brother bam says that this life
[1:27:31] is our training training for
[1:27:34] reigning
[1:27:36] right and God knows how to train us and
[1:27:39] you know when we go through the things
[1:27:40] in life we go through we keep realizing
[1:27:43] over and over that only the Commandment
[1:27:45] Works only the word works that's the
[1:27:48] only place to be every time I step away
[1:27:50] I hurt myself I hurt others others I do
[1:27:52] damage every time I step out of the
[1:27:55] Commandment I I'm hurting myself or
[1:27:57] others amen and then God by his grace
[1:27:59] and mercy he will bring me back in amen
[1:28:02] but but I'm learning a lesson over and
[1:28:04] over and over and over I'm learning amen
[1:28:07] that to stay in the word is the best
[1:28:10] thing
[1:28:11] yes God loves us so much that he allows
[1:28:14] us to learn this lesson amen God didn't
[1:28:16] put a fence around the tree in the
[1:28:18] garden amen God didn't chop it down and
[1:28:20] burn it God didn't run down and grab by
[1:28:22] the hand and pull them away God knew
[1:28:24] that the lesson is going to be a
[1:28:26] valuable lesson because mankind is going
[1:28:28] to learn the only thing I want is to
[1:28:30] abide in his love to stay in his
[1:28:33] commandment to stay behind the wall of
[1:28:35] his word because that's the safest place
[1:28:39] for me to be I won't wind up with
[1:28:43] scars with bruises with wounds if I stay
[1:28:47] here but the scars and the bruises and
[1:28:50] the wounds are also God God's
[1:28:52] grace just like brother Brenham coming
[1:28:55] back into town and having problems with
[1:28:57] the weather it was God's grace to remind
[1:29:00] him always keep the word always obey my
[1:29:07] voice on Isaiah
[1:29:11] 53 I want to read from verse
[1:29:16] 4 surely he hath borne our griefs and
[1:29:19] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[1:29:22] him stricken smitten of God and
[1:29:26] Afflicted but he was wounded for our
[1:29:29] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:29:31] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[1:29:34] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[1:29:38] healed all we like sheep have gone
[1:29:41] astray we have turned everyone to his
[1:29:43] own way and the Lord hath laid on him
[1:29:46] the iniquity of us all he was oppressed
[1:29:49] and he was afflicted yet he opened not
[1:29:51] his mouth he's brought as a lamb to the
[1:29:54] slaughter and as a sheep before the
[1:29:55] shears is dumb so he openeth not his
[1:29:58] mouth he was taken from prison and from
[1:30:00] judgment and who shall declare his
[1:30:02] generation for he was cut off for he was
[1:30:06] for he was cut off out of the land of
[1:30:08] the living for the transgression of my
[1:30:10] people was he
[1:30:15] stricken not for
[1:30:17] himself but for the people of God for
[1:30:19] the children of God God
[1:30:23] provided his love provided for our
[1:30:27] transgressions for our iniquities for
[1:30:29] our Disobedience for our
[1:30:31] failure his love provided a way
[1:30:36] back and that love was found in Jesus
[1:30:40] Christ when God formed that body and
[1:30:43] stepped into it lived his life and then
[1:30:46] went and shed the blood of God on
[1:30:49] Calvary to what to atone for my my
[1:30:52] transgressions why I I I should be there
[1:30:58] you should be there I should have been
[1:31:00] whipped I should have had the beard put
[1:31:02] on I should have been spit on I should
[1:31:04] have been mocked I should have been
[1:31:05] ridiculed I should have had all of these
[1:31:07] things but it's a Father's Love who will
[1:31:09] bring re reconciliation by a sacrifice
[1:31:12] and he provided his own sacrifice if I
[1:31:15] would have just stayed with the word I
[1:31:17] would never if if you would have just
[1:31:19] stayed with the word if Adam would have
[1:31:21] justay with the word none of this would
[1:31:23] have been necessary none of this would
[1:31:25] have happened but he made this provision
[1:31:27] before Adam fell before the woman was
[1:31:31] deceived he made this provision why I
[1:31:33] think he wants us to know his love and
[1:31:35] his grace and his Mercy that he had I
[1:31:37] think he wants us to know him in the
[1:31:40] multitude of his long-suffering grace
[1:31:42] and
[1:31:43] mercy so we can say it wasn't ever me it
[1:31:48] was never me I messed up and then I
[1:31:51] messed up again again and then he
[1:31:52] rescued me and I messed up again and
[1:31:53] then he rescued me and I messed up again
[1:31:55] oh but it was his longsuffering grace
[1:31:58] and mercy that rescued me I couldn't
[1:32:00] rescue myself but he rescued
[1:32:05] me brother R says in the Rapture message
[1:32:07] he said I've always preached that he was
[1:32:12] deity not just a man he was God manifest
[1:32:15] In the Flesh God the attribute of god of
[1:32:17] love the great attributes that come down
[1:32:19] displayed here on Earth of God Jes Jesus
[1:32:22] was God's love which built a body that
[1:32:25] Jehovah himself lived in he was the
[1:32:26] fullness of the godhead bodly what God
[1:32:29] was he manifested through that body that
[1:32:31] body had to die so he could wash the
[1:32:34] bride with his blood what did he need he
[1:32:37] needed me clean but he couldn't depend
[1:32:39] on me to keep myself clean so he
[1:32:42] provided a blood he provided a life that
[1:32:44] would cleanse
[1:32:45] me he brought back his word that would
[1:32:48] cleanse us from the filth of these
[1:32:49] prostitutes why because he couldn't
[1:32:51] depend on me to keep myself clean
[1:32:53] because a man is a failure to begin
[1:32:56] with so God made a
[1:32:59] provision so that when I hurt myself I
[1:33:02] can go running back to him and say oh
[1:33:04] I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[1:33:06] I'm sorry and he can say I have a Sav I
[1:33:10] have a cream I have an atonement I have
[1:33:12] a word I have a blood that'll wash that
[1:33:15] sin
[1:33:16] away I have already made a provision I
[1:33:19] knew someday you would touch it but my
[1:33:22] love made a provision for me all you've
[1:33:24] got to do is come running back to the
[1:33:26] one who loves you and the one who loves
[1:33:28] you has the sav he's got he's got the
[1:33:31] ointment he's got the cream he's got the
[1:33:33] thing that'll heal and restore and bind
[1:33:35] up and deliver yes
[1:33:40] amen first John says it this way 1 John
[1:33:43] 1 18 if we say that we have no sin we
[1:33:47] deceive
[1:33:48] ourselves this is brother brandham said
[1:33:52] Sinners don't have sins they have sin
[1:33:54] which is unbelief yeah and everything
[1:33:56] they do is an attribute of unbelief he
[1:33:58] goes but Saints have
[1:34:00] sins where we fall short we have
[1:34:02] mistakes backslidings
[1:34:05] transgressions right is that right not
[1:34:07] unbelief we're not disbelieving the word
[1:34:09] we're just failing it yeah we've been
[1:34:13] delivered from being sinners from
[1:34:14] unbelievers we're not under that
[1:34:16] category anymore now we're Saints amen
[1:34:19] but but we're still failing in some Aras
[1:34:22] we're still making mistakes we're still
[1:34:23] falling short what do I do now amen he
[1:34:26] he says if we say we have no sin we
[1:34:29] deceive
[1:34:30] ourselves and the truth is not in us if
[1:34:33] we confess our sins he is faithful and
[1:34:36] just to forgive us our sins and to
[1:34:38] cleanse us from all
[1:34:39] unrighteousness why cuz he's got a water
[1:34:42] of the bleeding water of the word that
[1:34:45] he can wash away all sin and all
[1:34:47] transgression what is he looking for
[1:34:49] he's waiting for us Amen to stop stop
[1:34:51] moving away from him and stop trying to
[1:34:54] get over to this thing we're not
[1:34:55] supposed to touch but at some point he
[1:34:58] can't do anymore some point he's already
[1:35:00] said what he's going to say he's
[1:35:01] preached what he's going to preach he
[1:35:03] sent a prophet he sent a preacher he
[1:35:04] sent his Bible and we got tapes we got
[1:35:06] books at some point he's just going to
[1:35:09] have to watch you touch the stove yeah
[1:35:12] right but oh if we would just quickly
[1:35:15] say oh God oh God oh God I touched the
[1:35:19] stove yeah I did what you you told me
[1:35:21] not to do and I'm hurt please forgive me
[1:35:24] oh God would you wash me cleanse me yeah
[1:35:28] amen that's what he's looking for
[1:35:31] friends he knew you would touch it
[1:35:33] that's why he's the lamb slain before
[1:35:34] the foundation on don't pretend you
[1:35:37] didn't what good does it do if you
[1:35:40] pretend that you've never touched the
[1:35:41] stove then you don't need the
[1:35:43] blood you don't need the washing of the
[1:35:45] water of the word you've already come to
[1:35:47] Perfection you're walking around with
[1:35:48] scarred up hands in your pocket acting
[1:35:50] like nothing ever happened yeah
[1:35:54] right let's just run back to father and
[1:35:57] say oh
[1:35:58] God I touched it Lord he knows you did
[1:36:02] anyways
[1:36:04] yeah touched it I did what I shouldn't
[1:36:07] have done I said what I shouldn't have
[1:36:08] said I looked at what I wasn't supposed
[1:36:10] to look
[1:36:11] at God would you forgive me and heal me
[1:36:14] I've wounded
[1:36:17] myself I've scarred myself I've damaged
[1:36:20] myself
[1:36:22] my mind is polluted my body is corrupted
[1:36:25] I it's not your fault you were always
[1:36:28] merciful you were always you know
[1:36:30] sometimes we pray such foolish prayers
[1:36:33] God why didn't you stop
[1:36:37] me that's an absolute selfish prayer you
[1:36:41] wanted God to share responsibility for
[1:36:43] your transgression of the
[1:36:45] word
[1:36:46] right God why didn't you stop me you
[1:36:48] could have stopped me why didn't you
[1:36:49] just take this away why didn't you just
[1:36:51] stand in my way why didn't you just shut
[1:36:52] the door why didn't you just send
[1:36:53] somebody it is not God's fault God gave
[1:36:56] us his word he gave it in every format
[1:36:59] in every form and Perfection we have his
[1:37:01] word it's not his fault it's our fault
[1:37:04] like Daniel
[1:37:05] said but if we would just recognize that
[1:37:08] and not try to make the church
[1:37:10] accountable my parents accountable other
[1:37:12] members of the body accountable my
[1:37:14] spouse accountable my boss accountable
[1:37:16] amen my boss made me mad that's why I
[1:37:18] said
[1:37:20] that
[1:37:22] they cheated me out of overtime that's
[1:37:24] why I stole the
[1:37:27] calculator but that's the nonsense that
[1:37:30] goes on in our
[1:37:32] minds instead of just saying I failed I
[1:37:35] made a mistake I deserve this pain but
[1:37:38] I'm hurting I've damaged myself oh God I
[1:37:41] mean you know Henry has no idea how
[1:37:43] mama's going to save him he has no idea
[1:37:46] how mama's going to deliver him all he
[1:37:48] knows is Mama and Daddy can help me now
[1:37:51] they can do something for me I don't
[1:37:52] know what to do and I'm telling you you
[1:37:54] may not know how God can deliver you in
[1:37:56] your situation how he can make this
[1:37:58] tragedy in your life go away or these
[1:38:00] damage that you've done to yourself but
[1:38:02] don't worry about that just run with
[1:38:04] your hand out and say oh Father father
[1:38:06] God Daddy Daddy I hurt myself would you
[1:38:10] heal me would you restore me would you
[1:38:11] help me
[1:38:16] God if we think we have no sin we
[1:38:18] deceive ourselves but all if we would
[1:38:21] confess our sins we'd be faithful and
[1:38:25] just forgive us our sins and cleanse us
[1:38:27] from all
[1:38:29] unrighteousness in the message in time
[1:38:31] evangelism he says you can't exhaust
[1:38:34] God could you imagine a little rat that
[1:38:37] long a little mouse under the great
[1:38:38] Garners of Egypt saying I better eat one
[1:38:41] grain of wheat a day I might run out
[1:38:42] before the next
[1:38:44] Harvest could you imagine a little fish
[1:38:46] about that long swimming out in the
[1:38:48] middle of the ocean saying I better
[1:38:49] drink of this water spare in ly because
[1:38:51] you know it might go dry
[1:38:53] sometime oh my that's trying to exhaust
[1:38:56] God's goodness and mercy to his
[1:39:00] people don't ever think you can't go to
[1:39:02] him again and you can't repent once more
[1:39:06] amen he said I'm so ashamed I did the
[1:39:09] same thing I did before this is the
[1:39:11] third fourth fifth it doesn't matter I
[1:39:13] mean when when the disciples were asking
[1:39:15] how many times do I forgive somebody a
[1:39:17] transgression Against Me Jesus said uh
[1:39:19] 490 times and one
[1:39:21] day he was and that's a human being he's
[1:39:24] trying to teach how to forgive their
[1:39:26] brother what about God forgiving you
[1:39:28] don't think that well i' I've already
[1:39:30] made a mistake I can't go back to God
[1:39:31] again who says you can't go back to God
[1:39:34] again who says he gets tired he ever
[1:39:36] gets tired of consoling you healing you
[1:39:38] comforting you who says that he's ever
[1:39:40] run out of grace and
[1:39:42] mercy who says that he's tired of
[1:39:45] longsuffering for his children he's not
[1:39:47] growing tired of the longsuffering for
[1:39:49] his children he's not running out of
[1:39:51] compassion his compassion won't fail
[1:39:53] he's not running out of
[1:39:57] Mercy well this one's a big
[1:40:01] one but you don't know brother Ted this
[1:40:03] one's really
[1:40:05] bad listen the little one and the big
[1:40:08] one are still equally as
[1:40:11] bad they may leave different scars in
[1:40:14] your life yeah but in the eyes of God
[1:40:17] they're not different they're both a
[1:40:19] transgression against the word
[1:40:24] the effect it has on us may
[1:40:28] vary that's just the reality of Life the
[1:40:32] scar you bear the pain you suffer and
[1:40:33] the duration with which you have to
[1:40:35] suffer it may vary depending on what we
[1:40:38] do but it doesn't change anything with
[1:40:40] the eyes of God if you'll confess your
[1:40:43] sins he's faithful to forgive your sins
[1:40:46] and cleanse you from all
[1:40:47] unrighteousness even it's the 490th
[1:40:52] time you can exhaust God's goodness and
[1:40:56] mercy to his
[1:40:58] people let's turn to Romans chapter 3
[1:41:09] together you see why Wednesday was an
[1:41:11] incomplete thought it put us all on the
[1:41:15] limb we knew it was the truth you can't
[1:41:17] deny it's the truth it's absolutely the
[1:41:19] truth but at least leaves every one of
[1:41:21] us bankrupt and
[1:41:23] destitute it leaves every one of us a
[1:41:25] failure and deserving of everything we
[1:41:28] get that's why these two things have to
[1:41:30] come together so that we know how to
[1:41:33] live Romans chapter 3 verse
[1:41:41] 22 even the righteousness of God which
[1:41:44] is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and
[1:41:47] upon all them that believe for there is
[1:41:49] no difference for all have sinned and
[1:41:53] come short of the glory of
[1:41:56] God yeah I I I think all is all I think
[1:42:00] I'm included in that for being justified
[1:42:04] freely by his grace through the
[1:42:06] Redemption that is in Christ Jesus who
[1:42:09] God has set forth to be a propitiation
[1:42:11] through faith in his blood to declare
[1:42:13] his righteousness for the remission of
[1:42:16] sins that are passed through the
[1:42:17] forbearance of God to declare I say at
[1:42:20] this time his righteousness that he
[1:42:22] might be just and the justifier of them
[1:42:25] which believe in Jesus where is boasting
[1:42:28] then it is excluded amen by what law of
[1:42:33] Works nay but by the law of
[1:42:37] faith if we could have done everything
[1:42:40] God commanded us and always done it
[1:42:42] right we would have never needed
[1:42:44] Christ is that right we wouldn't have
[1:42:46] needed the blood but he knew that we
[1:42:49] wouldn't I mean we could never get it
[1:42:51] all right does that exclude us from the
[1:42:53] obligation of keeping his Commandments
[1:42:55] does that mean if we love him we won't
[1:42:56] keep no that doesn't change the first
[1:42:58] service at one drop it doesn't change
[1:43:01] anything we spoke it's obligatory it's
[1:43:04] mandatory this is what God wants this is
[1:43:06] what he expects and if we violate that
[1:43:08] we're going to hurt ourselves that is
[1:43:10] every bit the truth but the reality is
[1:43:14] if we could keep all of The Commandments
[1:43:16] and do everything he said then we no
[1:43:17] longer need the blood we no longer need
[1:43:19] the washing of the water word the
[1:43:21] reality is this is God's word this is
[1:43:23] the wall this is imp penetral this is
[1:43:25] safe amen you don't need anything else
[1:43:28] the problem is we are born in sin shap
[1:43:30] in iniquity and a failure to begin with
[1:43:32] and are continually failing I need
[1:43:35] Deliverance not just the deliverance
[1:43:37] from the word that delivers us from so
[1:43:39] much think about it friends in the lives
[1:43:42] that we live with the families we have
[1:43:43] with the fellowship we are delivered
[1:43:45] from so much pain and so much suffering
[1:43:48] that the world is experiencing right now
[1:43:50] his commandment is already delivering Us
[1:43:52] in obedience to the Commandment but I
[1:43:54] can't do it all all the time amen so I
[1:43:57] need another Deliverance that's found in
[1:44:00] his grace and his
[1:44:02] Mercy I need a place to go and say God
[1:44:05] forgive
[1:44:06] me I'm
[1:44:09] hurting let's go to Romans chapter
[1:44:18] 11 Romans chapter 11:
[1:44:27] 25 for I would not Brethren that you
[1:44:29] should be ignorant of this mystery L you
[1:44:32] should be wise in your own conceits that
[1:44:34] blindness in part has happened to Israel
[1:44:37] until the fullness of the Gentiles be
[1:44:38] come in and so all Israel shall be saved
[1:44:41] as it is written there come out of Zion
[1:44:43] the deliverer and shall turn away
[1:44:45] ungodliness from Jacob for this is my
[1:44:48] Covenant unto them when when I shall
[1:44:50] take take away their
[1:44:52] sins as a as concerning the gospel they
[1:44:55] are enemies for your sakes but as
[1:44:57] touching the election they are beloved
[1:44:59] for the father's sake for the gifts and
[1:45:02] callings of God are without repentance
[1:45:04] for as ye in times past have not
[1:45:07] believed God yet have now obtained Mercy
[1:45:10] through their
[1:45:11] unbelief I want to read that again for
[1:45:14] as ye in times past have not believed
[1:45:17] God yet have now obtained Mercy through
[1:45:19] their unbelief
[1:45:22] why we weren't Believers the the
[1:45:24] Gentiles weren't Believers in
[1:45:27] God but through their
[1:45:29] unbelief God could turn from them to the
[1:45:33] Gentiles it was God's grace to the
[1:45:36] Gentiles amen so through their unbel
[1:45:39] unbelief Mercy now has turned to
[1:45:45] us even so have these also now not
[1:45:48] believed now they didn't believe Christ
[1:45:51] even so now these also now not believed
[1:45:54] that through your mercy they also May
[1:45:57] obtain Mercy for God ha concluded them
[1:46:00] all in unbelief that he might have mercy
[1:46:03] upon all oh the depth of the riches both
[1:46:07] of the wisdom and the knowledge of God
[1:46:10] how unsearchable are his judgments and
[1:46:12] his ways past finding out what God has
[1:46:15] done is he ended up throwing us all into
[1:46:19] unbelief so that he could show his mercy
[1:46:22] upon
[1:46:23] all I think God wants us to know he's a
[1:46:26] merciful god he's a long-suffering God
[1:46:30] and His compassions they fail
[1:46:34] not even turning away from the Jews so
[1:46:39] that we could obtain Mercy that through
[1:46:41] our Mercy one day they could also obtain
[1:46:44] Mercy when he turns back to them why so
[1:46:48] they all could be under God God's
[1:46:52] mercy I don't know about you but I love
[1:46:55] Mercy I love the mercy and the grace of
[1:46:58] God without it we would everyone be done
[1:47:02] finished
[1:47:03] gone if we got what we deserved we
[1:47:06] wouldn't be here
[1:47:07] now but he gave us what we don't deserve
[1:47:11] which is his grace and mercy and his
[1:47:13] great love shed abroad in our hearts by
[1:47:15] the Holy Ghost we didn't deserve that
[1:47:17] that's his love to
[1:47:19] us let's turn to Ephesians chapter
[1:47:29] 2 Ephesians chapter
[1:47:36] 2 verse
[1:47:40] four but God who is rich in
[1:47:44] Mercy oh I just love these
[1:47:47] scriptures but God who is he's not just
[1:47:50] merciful he's rich in
[1:47:52] Mercy The God Who is rich in Mercy for
[1:47:55] his great love wherewith he loved us
[1:47:57] even when we were dead in sins hath
[1:47:59] quickened us together with Christ by
[1:48:01] Grace you are saved and hath raised us
[1:48:04] up together and made us sit together in
[1:48:06] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in
[1:48:09] the ages to come he might show the
[1:48:10] exceeding Riches of his grace and his
[1:48:13] kindness towards us through Christ Jesus
[1:48:16] for by grace are you saved through faith
[1:48:18] and that not of yourselves it is the
[1:48:20] gift of God not of Works lest any man
[1:48:23] should
[1:48:25] boast did we get it right
[1:48:29] no I'd ask you this are we all perfectly
[1:48:33] getting it right right
[1:48:35] now I doubt
[1:48:39] it but all the abundance of his mercy
[1:48:43] God rich in Mercy when we were yet dead
[1:48:47] in sins and trespasses has he already
[1:48:49] quick us in
[1:48:53] Christ what a consolation for this life
[1:48:56] friends don't ever get so big don't get
[1:48:58] so high up in Revelation don't get so up
[1:49:01] in the in the realities of who we are
[1:49:04] that we don't forget that we're still in
[1:49:07] flesh
[1:49:09] yeah we're going to touch the
[1:49:12] stove I'm I hate to say that but you
[1:49:15] young people you older ones you're going
[1:49:17] to touch the
[1:49:19] stove but when you touch the stove don't
[1:49:21] hide your sin but forsake your sin run
[1:49:25] back to your father and say oh God I did
[1:49:28] it I did what you told me not to do I
[1:49:30] did what you warned me against but oh
[1:49:32] God would you forgive me would you wash
[1:49:35] me would you cleanse me will you heal me
[1:49:37] listen many of us are still bearing
[1:49:39] consequences of things that we did long
[1:49:41] ago we're still bearing about scars and
[1:49:43] consequences of past sins and past
[1:49:45] failures and and you have to say is
[1:49:48] there no Bal in Gilead is there no
[1:49:50] healing I believe there's still Mercy
[1:49:52] even for things done long ago even
[1:49:54] before we were Christians even after we
[1:49:55] were Christians failures from 20 years
[1:49:58] ago if you're still reaping a bad
[1:50:00] Harvest I would implore his Mercy I
[1:50:02] would say oh God turn Lord this evil for
[1:50:04] good God I did it I deserve it I don't
[1:50:07] deserve to have you come on the scene
[1:50:09] you don't owe me anything but I believe
[1:50:11] in your great Mercy I believe in your
[1:50:13] great grace God would you forgive me for

[1:56:48] now God in a congregation this size
[1:56:50] there's no there's no doubt there's a
[1:56:53] number of individuals who have been
[1:56:55] wounded by their own
[1:56:57] failure who have deep scars and
[1:57:01] wounds not just their own wounds they've

[1:57:25] humiliation we don't deserve anything
[1:57:28] but God we're not looking at that we're
[1:57:30] looking at your promise we're looking at
[1:57:33] your great love that provided a lamb
[1:57:35] before there was a
[1:57:36] failure God I believe you provided that
[1:57:39] lamb for
[1:57:40] me God I believe you knew that be the
[1:57:44] lamb slain from before the foundation of
[1:57:46] the world to cover for all my sins
[1:57:50] God I come to you now and I ask that you
[1:57:52] would bring a supernatural healing by
[1:57:54] your grace and mercy that you'd bring a
[1:57:57] Deliverance Lord there's people in here
[1:57:59] that no doubt are bound some way to sin
[1:58:02] Bound in an addiction Bound in a habit
[1:58:05] bound some way because they transgressed
[1:58:08] your word there may be families that are
[1:58:10] afflicted Lord and have uh are bound
[1:58:13] some way because they transgressed your
[1:58:15] word relationships may be under tension
[1:58:18] because of transgressing your
[1:58:21] word but God we have nothing to say for
[1:58:24] ourselves but we're guilty we're ashamed
[1:58:26] and we're
[1:58:27] sorry but God for every one of those
[1:58:30] situations would your grace and mercy
[1:58:32] Lord extend your blood would you wash by
[1:58:35] the washing of the water of the word the
[1:58:37] bleeding word that you've given us in
[1:58:39] this day and would you heal and would
[1:58:41] you restore and would you bless
[1:58:44] Lord God I thank you for your
[1:58:47] goodness bring your grace in abundantly
[1:58:50] in our lives Lord and help us to live
[1:58:52] differently than we've ever lived before
[1:58:54] let your spirit come upon us Lord and
[1:58:56] bring us Lord not into the repetition of
[1:58:58] failure but by your spirit may we heed
[1:59:01] to your spirit and yield to your spirit
[1:59:03] surrender to your word may you bring us
[1:59:04] into a higher life walking a different
[1:59:08] path God we're completely dependent upon
[1:59:11] you we're asking you to supply our needs
[1:59:14] Lord Heal us and Deliver Us by your
[1:59:17] great grace
[1:59:20] God if there's any here who've never
[1:59:23] received that pardon for the first
[1:59:26] time or maybe there's a barrier in their
[1:59:29] life they're afraid to commit they're
[1:59:30] afraid to
[1:59:32] surrender maybe they know that they're
[1:59:34] wrong and they're outside of your
[1:59:35] economy and they're separated from your
[1:59:38] life whether young or whether
[1:59:40] old I pray you'd go to them now and give
[1:59:43] them the
[1:59:44] courage to run to run to a father that
[1:59:48] loves them
[1:59:50] to run to a savior that's already made a
[1:59:52] provision before the life of failure
[1:59:54] before the sin may they recognize that
[1:59:57] you already have a plan for their life
[2:00:00] to heal to redeem to
[2:00:03] restore God if there's none who's
[2:00:05] accepted your pardon and received your
[2:00:07] salvation by grace I pray God that they
[2:00:09] would do so now that they would open
[2:00:11] their heart and they'd move past the
[2:00:13] barrier of past they move beyond the
[2:00:16] barrier of failure beyond the barrier of
[2:00:18] not being good enough enough beyond the
[2:00:20] fear of not being able to live the life
[2:00:23] may they move beyond all of that and
[2:00:26] just come running to you with their hand
[2:00:27] in the air and saying oh God I need your
[2:00:30] salvation I need your mercy I need your
[2:00:34] grace God I pray that you bless every
[2:00:36] young person every older
[2:00:39] one God you've made every provision we
[2:00:41] need in this life and in this end time
[2:00:43] you've given us
[2:00:46] abundantly we don't have to live below
[2:00:48] our privileges we don't have to stay
[2:00:50] bound and shattered and broken because
[2:00:53] you have sent a balb in Gilead to heal
[2:00:56] to restore to mend the broken places I
[2:00:59] pray God that you would allow us to open
[2:01:01] our hearts to receive it Lord to be
[2:01:03] honest with you to be open and allow you
[2:01:06] Lord to change our lives to heal us and
