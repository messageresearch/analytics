[0:00] in the great judgments of god
[0:04] god is going to bring
[0:07] every circumstance
[0:09] to his word
[0:11] so that there is no excuse on the day of
[0:14] judgment
[0:16] somebody will say you know
[0:18] but god i was handicapped and i i
[0:20] couldn't serve you he'll have somebody
[0:23] in his bride who was handicapped and
[0:24] served
[0:26] but god i didn't live near a church i
[0:28] couldn't drive two hours he'll have
[0:30] somebody who'll drive two hours to hear
[0:32] the word
[0:34] to show that
[0:35] that's no excuse
[0:38] you know somebody said you know if you
[0:40] knew what religious abuse i came from
[0:42] he'll have somebody in the bride who's
[0:43] come through religious abuse
[0:46] and surrender to the word there'll be no
[0:48] excuse on that day he said well i was
[0:50] neglected of my father if somebody was
[0:52] neglected of the father i was abused by
[0:54] my mother he'll have somebody who was
[0:56] abused by their mother
[0:58] just like you have somebody that will
[1:00] traverse the sands and deserts and
[1:02] robbers to come see solomon to stand as
[1:05] a testimony against a generation
[1:08] he'll have somebody who's went through
[1:10] persecution rejection abuse
[1:14] fallen pastors and and all kinds of uh
[1:18] troubles and and all kinds of vileness
[1:21] and
[1:21] and rejection and neglect
[1:24] he'll let all of that come to show that
[1:27] my word was enough
[1:29] that it would work
[1:31] and there's no excuse on that day nobody
[1:33] will have an excuse
[1:35] and we didn't drive two hours for that
[1:37] reason and we didn't we didn't overcome
[1:40] by god's grace rejection in complexes
[1:43] and neglect and abuse
[1:46] we did it because we loved him and we
[1:47] found his grace sufficient for us
[1:51] we did it because we were so happy that
[1:53] there was a word that can deliver us we
[1:54] came to him because he was our only
[1:56] option and our only source we gave him
[1:58] our life because for us it was a great
[2:00] exchange my life for eternal life my
[2:03] life for his it was an easy exchange for
[2:05] us
[2:07] but that very act
[2:09] amen will be condemnation for somebody
[2:11] who tries to use that same excuse for
[2:13] why they couldn't serve god
[2:15] and we never meant it for that we just
[2:18] lived the life he called us to
[2:20] we just lived grateful we lived for him
[2:22] we surrendered him because we had to
[2:24] because he put something in us that
[2:26] would live that way
[2:29] and i said let the word work in our
[2:31] lives
[2:32] and let it shine the light
[2:35] and everybody else
[2:37] just love them
[2:39] love them
[2:41] if i'm going to be guilty for anything
[2:44] i want to be guilty for being too kind
[2:47] too loving too generous and too merciful
[2:51] i don't want to be guilty of being too
[2:53] judgmental too critical
[2:57] if i'm going to make a mistake i want to
[2:58] make a mistake in being too kind
[3:01] and too loving
[3:03] and too generous
[3:06] god will sort everything out and make
[3:08] everything right on that day i don't
[3:09] have to sort it out today
[3:11] i don't have to figure it out
[3:13] i don't have to figure out the
[3:15] destination of all men and by the
[3:17] actions they commit where they fit in
[3:19] god will figure all that out
[3:22] i just want to love everybody
[3:24] because that person who's vile today
[3:26] could be my brother tomorrow
[3:28] that person who is living ungodly amen
[3:32] tomorrow could be sitting in the pew
[3:33] next to me the one that i hugged their
[3:35] neck every service i don't want to treat
[3:37] him bad i don't want to speak evil god
[3:40] will sort all that out
