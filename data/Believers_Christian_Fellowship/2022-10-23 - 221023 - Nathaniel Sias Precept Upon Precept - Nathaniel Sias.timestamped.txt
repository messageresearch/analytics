[3:26] if that's really your prayer today
[3:29] let's bow our heads and invite him
[3:32] to be here with us
[3:34] we just have a little short time
[3:36] together
[3:38] but it is your desire it's what's in
[3:40] your heart that makes him feel welcome
[3:43] you want the Holy Spirit to be close to
[3:45] you
[3:46] and make your heart open
[3:48] there's anything that's in the way
[3:51] you have something way upon your heart
[3:52] just set it to the side now
[3:55] set it to the side and say Lord I've
[3:57] come with an expectation
[4:00] and I I expect that you will speak to my
[4:02] need
[4:03] [Music]
[4:04] you will get what you expect
[4:07] if you expect nothing you will get
[4:09] nothing
[4:10] but if you expect that the god of
[4:13] creation
[4:14] can speak to you he will do so
[4:18] let us pray together
[4:20] heavenly father as we have come today
[4:25] the seasons are blurring together
[4:27] they're going by so quickly
[4:30] the phases the seasons of Life are going
[4:33] by so quickly
[4:36] the Lord there is one thing that grows
[4:38] brighter every day that is your word
[4:40] that is the work that you are doing in
[4:43] US
[4:44] so Lord as we have gathered together
[4:47] today and we are looking for what you
[4:50] would have for us we bow our heads Lord
[4:52] and just make it known specifically Lord
[4:54] we want to invite you to be here with us
[4:58] Lord what point is it that we talk about
[5:00] you but don't invite you to be here
[5:02] for God we can talk about things we can
[5:05] look at things but when you make it live
[5:07] it's it's real it's pertinent it's
[5:09] relevant
[5:11] and it connects with us
[5:13] wherever we happen to be today whatever
[5:15] situation we're in
[5:16] [Music]
[5:17] you are an ever-present God
[5:21] you are helped in our time of need
[5:24] and Lord there are many needs that are
[5:26] represented here today
[5:28] but Lord we believe that you're still a
[5:30] provider
[5:31] you're still a Healer
[5:33] you're still our champion
[5:36] it's an evil age but God the the
[5:39] evilness is growing dimmer
[5:42] and your light is growing brighter
[5:45] so Lord we commit our few moments we
[5:47] have to today into your hands ask that
[5:49] you'd have your way have your will Lord
[5:51] in Jesus Christ's name we commit it amen
[5:55] praise the Lord
[5:59] praise the lord it's wonderful to be
[6:00] together with you again today I greet
[6:02] you all
[6:04] you all
[6:06] I greet you all in the name of the Lord
[6:09] Jesus
[6:10] I pray that your testimonies have just
[6:13] multiplied since we've last been able to
[6:16] see each other
[6:17] God is good isn't he
[6:20] we live in a season that the world is
[6:23] just so obsessed with the darkness and
[6:25] the perversion
[6:26] but isn't it incredible that in the
[6:29] midst of that God just grows brighter
[6:32] sweeter more wonderful more personal
[6:36] every day
[6:38] I you know as much as we can talk or
[6:42] preach about it I just
[6:44] you know Saints the more we see the more
[6:47] overwhelming it is truly
[6:50] the more overwhelming that this message
[6:52] the grandness of this message is
[6:55] there are times when God just pulls back
[6:57] the veil a little bit more and you just
[6:59] want to go on a corner and weep
[7:01] and at the same time just scream and
[7:04] shout because your your heart is so full
[7:07] you just don't know what to do with
[7:09] yourself if you ever experienced that
[7:11] it's amazing thank you musicians I
[7:13] appreciate the worship this morning
[7:15] we're going to dive right into the word
[7:17] here
[7:18] I have a PowerPoint I don't know how
[7:20] much good it's going to do us
[7:22] because I don't know that we'll follow
[7:23] the presentation or the PowerPoint or
[7:25] not
[7:26] I do like to have at least when we're
[7:29] quoting things I know it's just much
[7:30] easier to kind of catch what's being
[7:33] said when it's written up on the screen
[7:34] that's helpful to me so I appreciate
[7:37] when ministers will do that so we try to
[7:39] do that today but I cannot I cannot
[7:41] commit to you that we will follow
[7:42] exactly this order as I was praying
[7:44] there's so many pieces to what God is
[7:47] doing right now that the challenges is
[7:49] not to find something to preach on
[7:52] there is just over an abundance and more
[7:54] and more and we could take days and
[7:56] weeks and months to focus on a detail
[7:59] the hardest part is to say Lord what is
[8:02] appropriate for today and what are we
[8:04] going to save for another day because
[8:06] it's so good we want to look at all of
[8:08] it but we want to make sure that we
[8:09] focus on
[8:11] What God Says is a priority for us today
[8:14] so this is what has been on my heart
[8:16] we're going to take a look at by the
[8:18] grace of God this little thought this
[8:19] morning
[8:21] and it is a it is a window into many
[8:24] other things but we want to take this
[8:26] one thought and there's a few pieces in
[8:28] here which I believe might be helpful to
[8:30] you by the grace of God we're going to
[8:32] pray that the Lord has his way
[8:35] precept upon precept let's go to the
[8:38] scriptures which are very familiar to us
[8:40] Isaiah 28
[8:44] and as I like to say you know I I grew
[8:46] up in a message and I've been around
[8:49] preachers and message Believers my
[8:52] entire life and we've all heard quotes
[8:54] and read scriptures but when we read the
[8:56] scripture many times we want to read it
[8:58] like it's the first time we ever read it
[9:00] because there are times when the Lord
[9:02] will just bring out a detail that we
[9:04] might have read it for 50 years
[9:06] and the Lord will take one word one day
[9:09] and just highlight it and suddenly the
[9:12] meaning of that scripture begins to open
[9:14] up in ways that it never has I know
[9:16] older ones today that are in their 70s
[9:18] their 80s and they're just saying
[9:20] this is so the things that we are seeing
[9:23] are so fantastic I've been walking with
[9:25] the Lord all these years and it's I've
[9:28] just never seen these things before
[9:31] God can do those things today praise the
[9:34] Lord here in Isaiah 28
[9:38] let's read verses 9 to 12 again familiar
[9:41] verses but we want to read it by God's
[9:43] grace like we have never read it before
[9:46] Isaiah 28 verses 9 through 12.
[9:51] Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom
[9:54] Shall he make to understand Doctrine
[9:57] them that are weaned from the milk and
[9:59] drawn from the breast
[10:01] for precept must be upon precept
[10:04] precept upon precept
[10:08] line upon line line upon line hear a
[10:11] little and there a little for with
[10:13] stammering lips and another tongue will
[10:15] he speak to this people to whom he said
[10:18] this is the rest wherewith you may cause
[10:21] the weary to rest this is the refreshing
[10:25] yet they would not hear
[10:27] may the Lord bless the word and you may
[10:29] have your seeds
[10:36] again there are many directions to go
[10:38] within these thoughts but I want to
[10:40] focus on a few things we want to build a
[10:42] little bit of a foundation like we
[10:43] always like to do we want to make sure
[10:45] that we have a good bearing in the
[10:47] scriptures and that is in fact much of
[10:49] what we want to talk about
[10:50] today is making sure that we have a good
[10:53] bearing that we have confidence in the
[10:56] scriptures
[10:57] we want to have confidence in the
[10:59] message that God has given us in this
[11:01] hour and we don't want to go beyond that
[11:03] there are times when we get so inspired
[11:05] by something and you know this is an
[11:07] example that I use often
[11:10] this is an example that I use often
[11:13] but it is it is so simple in that if you
[11:16] try to hit a Target
[11:18] and you overshoot the target
[11:19] overshooting the target is still a miss
[11:22] but many times when God tells us
[11:25] something he says now do this thing we
[11:27] get so inspired in us that we're going
[11:28] to do something above and beyond for God
[11:32] is it is that not true there are times
[11:34] when we feel like we want to do
[11:36] something so exceptional that we want to
[11:38] give God an exceptional gift but God
[11:41] says I want exactly the thing that I've
[11:43] asked you for nothing more nothing less
[11:47] there are times when we get caught up in
[11:49] depression and discouragement because we
[11:51] feel like we can never attain the things
[11:53] that God has said
[11:55] we can never do what God actually said
[11:57] because we feel like this thing is is
[11:59] bigger and it's farther away and it's
[12:01] bigger and farther away and the closer
[12:02] we get the bigger and farther away it
[12:04] becomes there's a part of that that's
[12:05] true
[12:06] God is is truly that amazing but there's
[12:09] an element of it that we put upon
[12:11] ourselves that we are are trying to do
[12:13] something for God we're trying to follow
[12:15] God's instruction but as soon as we get
[12:17] close to it in our minds we don't think
[12:20] we're worthy of it and we make it bigger
[12:22] than it is
[12:24] God did not give you something that's
[12:27] impossible for his children
[12:30] it's impossible for everyone else but
[12:32] it's not impossible for his children
[12:36] he said be thou perfect even as I am
[12:38] perfect
[12:39] and for anyone that does not have God in
[12:41] them
[12:42] we would say good luck
[12:44] we know that luck doesn't exist
[12:47] good luck
[12:48] because you can't
[12:50] because God is God and he has done the
[12:53] things that he has chosen to do and he
[12:55] has hidden them from the wise and The
[12:57] Prudent it's hidden it's a secret thing
[13:01] and when people aspire to be like God
[13:03] it's aspire to know the message though
[13:06] you might sit in a message Church though
[13:08] you might have grown up in the message
[13:09] you might have parents that are are
[13:11] believed that brother Branham is a
[13:13] prophet and that's a wonderful thing
[13:14] it's a wonderful start praise the Lord
[13:18] now what
[13:19] maybe you sit here today and you've been
[13:21] born and raised in a message Church been
[13:23] around message people your entire life
[13:25] what now
[13:29] friends are I believe that many are
[13:32] aware there's are Generations that are
[13:33] are moving on they're they're being laid
[13:35] to rest in the ground they're going off
[13:37] the scene those that knew brother
[13:39] Branham directly
[13:41] there are testimonies that are no longer
[13:43] being heard personally in the world
[13:45] there might be recordings of them but
[13:47] those individuals are going off the
[13:49] scene where is a generation that has a
[13:52] real personal experience with God that
[13:55] is so real
[13:57] that they can stand in front of the
[13:58] world with absolute absolute confidence
[14:01] and know that God is God and the message
[14:05] that God has given to them personally
[14:08] is real
[14:12] what a challenge to a generation
[14:16] we know that each generation has more
[14:18] Temptation than the last those that are
[14:20] sitting here today that might be in your
[14:21] maybe your late teens in your 20s the
[14:24] challenge that is set before you is
[14:26] impossible without God
[14:29] thank the Lord he said all things are
[14:32] possible
[14:33] through Jesus Christ Jesus Christ that
[14:35] strengthens me he is doing the work you
[14:38] are if you by by God's grace if you have
[14:40] given your heart to the Lord if God has
[14:42] called you you are God's people this is
[14:44] God's work you plant you water or who
[14:47] gives the increase
[14:49] God gives the increase
[14:51] so the generation that's sitting here
[14:55] this is always upon my heart that those
[14:57] that have been raised in a message
[14:58] Church there are there are unique
[15:00] situations unique pressures
[15:03] we take it for granted we think that
[15:05] they don't have trials
[15:08] well remember when we came out of a
[15:10] denominational Church my kids didn't
[15:12] have to go through that
[15:14] but they have trials just like you do
[15:17] they have different Temptations they
[15:19] have different trials maybe than what
[15:21] you experience
[15:23] and as you young people young girl ones
[15:26] are sitting here today God has something
[15:28] that he wants to do in you personally
[15:30] that the generations that are coming
[15:33] before you were held to a standard that
[15:36] were given a responsibility to hold
[15:40] and for you
[15:42] it's going to be a little bit different
[15:46] the world is changing
[15:48] there are those that are are coming of
[15:50] age they're being laid to Grant to rest
[15:52] in the ground they'll be raised when
[15:53] when the the gut calls them from the
[15:56] ground but the the generations that are
[15:59] going off the scene something has to
[16:02] happen something has to take place there
[16:05] has to be a generation that has a real
[16:07] Revelation that goes all the way back to
[16:10] what God began and intended in the
[16:12] beginning and it cannot be by natural
[16:14] inheritance
[16:17] man
[16:18] but how do we have that type of
[16:20] confidence
[16:23] we want to have confidence in God's word
[16:26] praise the Lord then we read our Bibles
[16:28] but the world reads their Bibles
[16:31] the whole Christian World reads their
[16:32] Bibles nowadays they might have
[16:34] different variety of Bibles
[16:35] interpretations of the Bible
[16:37] but they're reading a Bible
[16:40] how is it that we don't agree
[16:43] how is it that from message assembly to
[16:45] message assembly notice I didn't say
[16:47] church but from one assembly to another
[16:49] that believed that brother Brandon was a
[16:51] prophet believe that there's a message
[16:52] in this hour how is it that assemblies
[16:54] don't agree
[16:57] this is not multiple churches there is
[17:01] only one Church of God there's only one
[17:03] true group of elect and they are not
[17:06] separate we are joined together whether
[17:08] we like it or not we're connected
[17:10] because our father in Heaven called us
[17:13] named us
[17:15] put something in us and by that we are
[17:18] connected
[17:22] there is so much that we can
[17:26] find fault with one another
[17:28] I don't believe in there are times where
[17:31] people say well you just have to have
[17:33] fellowship with just because someone
[17:35] claims that they believe a certain way
[17:37] then you have to have fellowship with
[17:39] them now hold on now
[17:41] this is what we want to not this
[17:42] specifically but this idea of making an
[17:46] assumption we want to look at today and
[17:48] we want to build precept upon precept
[17:53] let me give you an example
[17:55] a physical example of this
[17:57] we're walking with the Lord
[18:00] and God has told us to go in this
[18:02] direction
[18:04] but remember that brother Branham told
[18:05] us that we are building a building not a
[18:07] wall
[18:08] is that right
[18:10] it's not just a straight wall there's a
[18:12] building that's being built
[18:15] and when God told us to go in a
[18:17] direction we go in that direction and we
[18:20] we go with the confidence that God told
[18:22] me to do this thing
[18:24] and we walk and we walk and God says
[18:27] take one step and we take one step
[18:30] and then we take another step
[18:33] but God didn't say that
[18:34] but God told me to go in this direction
[18:38] do you go only so far in that direction
[18:42] but if I take one more step
[18:44] I'm going to fall down the steps
[18:47] God told you to go so far and then he
[18:50] says turn left
[18:53] God's elect catch it and they move
[18:57] and don't think for a moment that you
[18:59] cannot make a mistake
[19:01] don't you think for a moment friend that
[19:03] you can't make mistake and find yourself
[19:05] out of the will of God
[19:07] because you can
[19:09] now God by his Grace Grace
[19:13] is not going to leave you there
[19:17] the identification of his children is
[19:20] that when he chastises his children
[19:22] which means they're wrong
[19:24] they're getting corrected
[19:26] they might have stepped a little too far
[19:28] but they say oh Lord Jesus forgive me
[19:30] if they've wronged somebody they go to
[19:32] the person and say brother sister
[19:34] forgive me for what I've done I need to
[19:36] get back on the wall
[19:37] God told me to go so far but I took one
[19:40] more step and I fell off into my own
[19:42] will
[19:43] I overshot the target
[19:47] there are times when we read the
[19:50] scripture
[19:51] and we believe that God May legitimately
[19:54] have told us to go in a direction and we
[19:57] went in that direction
[19:59] but God told us to stop or to turn
[20:02] and we missed it
[20:05] brother It seems impossible because it
[20:07] is
[20:09] it's impossible without god without the
[20:12] tutor that God gave you without the holy
[20:14] spirit it's absolutely impossible
[20:17] to please God
[20:20] it's impossible to follow his
[20:23] instruction
[20:24] let's continue on here
[20:31] this is from
[20:35] I wish I could take a picture right now
[20:38] you remember the Flies right
[20:41] one just landed on my Bible right here
[20:47] you don't remember that story my wife
[20:49] and I talking and a serious conversation
[20:52] with my wife and a fly comes through the
[20:54] room and hits me in the forehead
[20:59] well now they make these guns they shoot
[21:00] salt I don't know if you've seen those
[21:03] I'll just kind of leave it there
[21:07] 1963 the absolute
[21:11] so I needed an absolute so I took one
[21:13] God's word so I read in the word that he
[21:17] is the word Saint John 1 and upon this
[21:19] absolute I'll build my church
[21:22] that's right so I took him at his word
[21:25] revelation 22 19 and said whosoever
[21:28] shall take one word out of this or one
[21:30] word or add one word to it that's the
[21:32] absolute that's the end of all strife
[21:37] well that's pretty simple isn't it we
[21:39] open our Bible we read our Bible and
[21:40] then that's that all Strife is done
[21:45] should be right
[21:47] is that what happens
[21:49] that's not what happens
[21:54] this is the absolute just continuing on
[21:56] here from that same message this is the
[21:58] absolute whoever takes anything from it
[22:00] or adds anything to it God said I'll
[22:03] just take his part out of The Book of
[22:04] Life
[22:06] so that had to be the absolute and Jesus
[22:09] said man shall not live by bread alone
[22:11] but by every word then I know that this
[22:14] every word had to be said
[22:16] precept upon precept and line upon line
[22:19] that's the way it has to come just as
[22:21] it's written praise the lord we all
[22:24] agree I believe with those statements
[22:27] line upon line precept upon precept we
[22:29] believe the word
[22:35] now this is from Revelation chapter 5
[22:37] number one
[22:39] so this is one thing
[22:42] that they might squabble about this in
[22:44] here
[22:45] about what it is but he's the one that
[22:48] divinely interprets it
[22:50] but on the back side here there's no one
[22:53] can do it it belongs to him
[22:56] it belongs to him and him alone he's the
[22:59] one that can reveal those seven
[23:01] Mysteries out and watch how every bit of
[23:03] it is on Redemption how the church was
[23:06] redeemed and what will be the redeeming
[23:12] so you mean to tell me that I can read
[23:14] this
[23:17] I can read what is written in black and
[23:19] white
[23:20] I can read the ink that is pressed upon
[23:23] these pages
[23:25] but not read the book
[23:29] I can read the front side of the book
[23:31] but there's something more that has been
[23:33] written
[23:35] I can memorize it
[23:37] I can get to know it I can read it front
[23:39] to back
[23:42] I can listen to the message I can
[23:43] memorize quote after quote after quote I
[23:46] can understand and I can talk about the
[23:49] message and I can make connections and
[23:51] all of these things
[23:53] but unless it's open
[23:55] Ed
[23:57] by him
[23:59] unless it's opened by the father or
[24:01] Peter where does this come from only
[24:03] from the Father which is in heaven
[24:06] how does this come only by the father
[24:10] line upon line precept upon precept
[24:16] but friends there are people that are
[24:18] reading line upon line
[24:22] but they still cannot see precept upon
[24:25] precept
[24:28] they're reading the front of the book
[24:30] They're reading the page of the book
[24:31] they really really want to understand
[24:35] but it can only come by the father
[24:39] and we cannot break our way into it
[24:43] you cannot study your way into it
[24:46] you cannot force your way in through a
[24:48] window
[24:49] God gave away and you must come God's
[24:52] way and you must make a request of him
[24:56] Lord I desire to understand
[24:59] [Music]
[25:00] as brother Benham taught us we didn't
[25:02] seek Him He sought us
[25:04] we're here because God has called us
[25:06] well brother I don't know if God loves
[25:08] me I don't know if God really cares
[25:10] about me that much are you here today
[25:13] well yes I'm here why are you here today
[25:15] because there's just I just really
[25:17] wanted to go to church there's a desire
[25:18] in me I want to do right I just can't
[25:21] seem to do right but if you want to do
[25:23] right
[25:24] there's a deep that's calling
[25:27] and if there's a deep that's calling
[25:30] there's a deep to respond
[25:33] it's that deep that's we're looking to
[25:35] respond we're looking for that deep
[25:38] [Applause]
[25:42] explain
[25:44] it's not reading the front of the book
[25:46] there's more to it
[25:54] let's go to Hebrews 9 if you would
[26:04] let's see if we can
[26:06] continue to lay a foundation here that
[26:09] we might understand
[26:28] Hebrews 9
[26:30] . appreciate your prayers my voice will
[26:34] there's times when it when you when you
[26:36] preach it's really hard to hold back
[26:38] sometimes it's wisdom to hold back a
[26:40] little bit
[26:41] but it's hard and the voice doesn't like
[26:43] it
[26:45] so my voice is a little worn out I pray
[26:47] you just again just pray for me if you
[26:49] would
[26:51] Hebrews 9.
[26:54] verses 9 to 12.
[27:03] give me just a moment here
[27:07] I'm sorry I wrote down nine to twelve
[27:09] let's go to verse number 19 to 24.
[27:17] Hebrews 9 19 to 24.
[27:24] for when Moses had spoken every precept
[27:28] to all the people according to the law
[27:31] he took the blood of calves and of goats
[27:34] with water and Scarlet wool and hyssop
[27:36] and sprinkled both the book and all the
[27:39] people
[27:40] saying this is the blood of the
[27:41] testament which God hath enjoined unto
[27:43] you moreover he sprinkled with blood
[27:45] both the Tabernacle and all the vessels
[27:47] of the ministry and almost all things
[27:50] are by law purged with the blood and
[27:52] without shedding of blood is no
[27:53] remission of sin
[27:56] let's read verse number 23 very
[27:59] carefully
[28:00] it was therefore necessary that the
[28:02] patterns of things in the heavens should
[28:05] be purified with ease
[28:08] but the Heavenly things themselves with
[28:11] better sacrifices than these
[28:15] for Christ is not entered into holy
[28:18] places made with hands which are the
[28:20] figures of the true but into heaven
[28:22] itself now to appear in the presence of
[28:25] God for us
[28:28] verse number 23 again
[28:30] it was therefore necessary that the
[28:32] patterns of things in the heavens should
[28:35] be purified with these
[28:37] but the Heavenly things themselves with
[28:39] better sacrifices than these
[28:42] the picture that we are understanding
[28:44] that is being explained
[28:46] Moses presents the law he presents the
[28:49] law in the Old Testament they learned
[28:51] the law they're trying to obey the law
[28:56] these things are presented through Moses
[28:59] they're being presented as an example a
[29:01] type of a Heavenly pattern but what is
[29:04] being explained here is that this this
[29:08] heavenly pattern which is now Moses has
[29:10] set the law in order has set things in
[29:12] order there is something that is greater
[29:14] than these things though these things
[29:16] are representing a Heavenly pattern
[29:20] these things are for a season are doing
[29:23] a purpose but there is within that
[29:26] a greater thing
[29:30] it is not the natural that God is after
[29:32] and yet the natural is representing a
[29:35] spiritual pattern
[29:38] so let us say it this way
[29:41] within the line there is a precept
[29:44] so though you read the line you may miss
[29:47] the precept
[29:49] we read the precept excuse me we read
[29:51] the line but if we miss the precept we
[29:54] miss the message in the line
[29:58] brother I sit in a message church I've
[30:01] always believed the message again going
[30:03] back to our thoughts for the younger
[30:04] ones that are here today or for my heart
[30:06] is uh it's always burden for those that
[30:08] have grown up in a message church that
[30:10] they might have such confidence and it's
[30:12] the same situation where brother I sit
[30:14] in a message church but what is within
[30:17] that
[30:21] the young people
[30:22] know how to act
[30:25] they know how to do the part
[30:28] they know how to say the right words
[30:32] they are a physically representing the
[30:36] physically written words
[30:40] they know it I I witnessed it
[30:43] I witnessed those that would present on
[30:45] such some some were some young people
[30:48] that I grew up with were so good at
[30:51] representing themselves to the adults
[30:53] that they were
[30:54] they were really super spiritual
[30:57] but I knew what was going on in their
[31:00] private lives
[31:03] you see the things that God is calling
[31:04] us to
[31:06] it's more than we know this but I feel
[31:09] that the need in my heart to say it
[31:10] anyway it is more than presenting a good
[31:13] face
[31:15] we know it but friends we still at times
[31:19] we get caught in it and the moment when
[31:21] we do we start to Step Beyond what God
[31:24] is calling us to
[31:26] God has laid out these these patterns
[31:29] he's laid out the scriptures so that we
[31:31] might understand not what is written in
[31:33] black and white
[31:36] there is something here that has been
[31:38] captured written down but there's within
[31:40] it there's something that's so great
[31:43] that you cannot break your way into it
[31:49] is that simple
[31:50] there's a Heavenly pattern that this is
[31:52] what is being described here in Hebrews
[31:56] there's a Heavenly pattern but now God
[31:59] is that representation he is doing that
[32:01] thing literally he is in heaven
[32:04] representing he's given his life now in
[32:06] the book of Hebrews he's given his life
[32:08] now and he is represent he is he is
[32:11] doing the thing that the old testament's
[32:13] represented yeah it was written in the
[32:16] Old Testament Moses gave the law but the
[32:18] law was to represent something and
[32:21] within the law was something so precious
[32:23] that it was hidden from the world
[32:27] it was it was wrapped around it was
[32:29] hidden and it was not explained
[32:32] until the last days
[32:34] there's a message that's so great that
[32:36] you can read about it in the book and
[32:39] you can't get it
[32:42] but I really want to know what God has
[32:44] for my life
[32:46] but I really want to to know so we read
[32:49] our Bibles and that's a good thing
[32:52] we read our Bibles and we we do what we
[32:55] understand to do
[32:57] but what we're by the grace of God what
[32:59] we're highlighting today
[33:05] if I could say it this way
[33:10] God's word
[33:13] is so simple
[33:17] God's word is so real
[33:20] for every person sitting here today
[33:24] God's word has answers for every single
[33:27] thing
[33:29] that you have questions on
[33:33] but we make it something that is not
[33:39] we look at God's word
[33:43] and we change it not intentionally
[33:47] it doesn't matter how long you've walked
[33:48] with the Lord
[33:49] again
[33:51] you could be walking with the Lord for
[33:53] 50 years
[33:55] and when God opens a key to somebody
[33:57] opens up something in a certain way it
[34:00] can change your life even now today
[34:02] right now
[34:04] well brother I'm always already walking
[34:06] with the Lord I've been born again I
[34:09] know that God has done a work in me I
[34:10] believe this message which all with all
[34:12] my heart praise the Lord but now where
[34:14] are you at this is applicable for every
[34:16] single person that's sitting here today
[34:18] the place where you are at right now
[34:21] you can go further
[34:24] we are growing up until that moment
[34:26] where Jesus said at the moment when the
[34:29] wheat is mature it's cut down
[34:32] at the moment when maturity at full
[34:34] maturity is taking place at that moment
[34:36] God calls for us to leave this place
[34:41] how do we get there
[34:43] how do we know what the next step is the
[34:46] challenge the big question is always
[34:48] what do I do now
[34:50] how do I know how do I follow the
[34:52] leadership of God right now today
[34:56] Hebrews here in 24 we see this example
[34:59] of the heavenly
[35:01] the Heavenly pattern represented on
[35:04] Earth
[35:05] now here in 1962 presuming
[35:09] therefore basing back in the Old
[35:11] Testament I draw these conclusions
[35:14] for a little message now presuming
[35:18] Webster I've got it wrote out here
[35:20] Webster said
[35:29] to presume is to venture without actual
[35:31] Authority that's presuming
[35:34] or in parentheses he's got Webster
[35:37] taking it for granted just taking it for
[35:40] granted or to venture without authority
[35:42] to take something just for granted
[35:49] now that's something that the church
[35:52] must not do
[35:54] you're not sure of yourself if you're
[35:56] just presuming
[35:58] for you're just taking it for granted
[36:03] well brother Branham did it this way
[36:05] I'm just going to do exactly what
[36:07] brother Branham did
[36:09] I'm going to follow the word I'm going
[36:10] to do exactly what the word says then
[36:13] why aren't we boat builders
[36:15] because the word told God told Noah to
[36:18] build an ark
[36:19] then why aren't we all building an ark
[36:23] why aren't we doing that now we know the
[36:25] answer to that but let's use it as an
[36:27] example why are we not doing those
[36:30] things because specific instruction was
[36:32] given there was a requirement that was
[36:34] given and it was the word of God
[36:38] and here is Noah building an ark and of
[36:41] course we know that everyone disagrees
[36:42] with him but brother Madam gives give
[36:44] this this example this in the days of
[36:47] Jesus Jesus is walking on the Earth but
[36:49] Jesus if Jesus preached the message of
[36:51] Noah it would have been wrong how is
[36:53] that possible when the message that Noah
[36:56] received is the word of God
[37:03] there was a message that was given to
[37:04] Noah there was instruction that was
[37:07] given to Noah
[37:09] they followed the instruction
[37:12] but within the instruction was a
[37:15] representation of a precept
[37:19] there was something that was being
[37:21] represented by what Noah was doing that
[37:23] was bigger even than what Noah was doing
[37:26] God committed a precept that when
[37:29] judgment is about to come that he will
[37:31] give away of escape and here it is being
[37:34] played out in this dramatic scene Noah
[37:36] is building an ark
[37:39] in the instruction
[37:42] was a precept
[37:45] and there are times where we look at
[37:47] instruction that has been given and we
[37:50] confuse the instruction with the precept
[37:55] we hear the instruction
[37:57] we we want to be obedient but in the
[38:00] instruction we miss the precinct
[38:04] so we are following this instruction
[38:06] and this instruction and this
[38:09] instruction and this instruction
[38:12] and Our Lives begin to produce
[38:16] strife
[38:17] but God never produces strife
[38:21] not with his children not not amongst
[38:23] his children and not within his children
[38:25] God is the author of Peace God is
[38:27] presenting peace he's giving us a
[38:29] message of peace and when he gives us a
[38:31] message a message of Peace it produces
[38:33] peace
[38:36] but I'm following the instruction
[38:39] I'm trying to do what God told me to do
[38:42] but friends there are times when we are
[38:44] looking at the instruction
[38:46] and we miss the precept
[38:49] this is why Jesus said I come not to
[38:52] destroy the law
[38:54] but to fulfill the law
[38:57] the precepts are written in the law of
[39:00] Moses but if you try to only follow the
[39:02] law it produces death
[39:05] friends it's so close it seems that I
[39:09] have a genuine desire I desire to do
[39:11] what is right and I'm following the
[39:13] instructions of God but we miss the
[39:15] precepts we miss God's intention
[39:22] and in doing so
[39:24] we miss apply
[39:26] we misunderstand
[39:28] the precepts
[39:31] it is not just line upon line
[39:34] it is precept
[39:36] upon Precinct
[39:38] we're getting line upon line I am I'm
[39:40] learning what the message is I'm I'm
[39:42] learning all of these things about the
[39:44] message but within that the within that
[39:47] teaching within those line upon line
[39:49] upon line
[39:50] God is looking to do something
[39:53] God is looking to build
[39:56] something
[39:59] God doesn't give you a precept and leave
[40:01] it there
[40:03] God gives you a precept
[40:06] we pray on it it becomes part of us
[40:10] and he adds to that precept
[40:13] you understand this precept
[40:16] let's take for example Thou shalt not
[40:17] lie
[40:19] Thou shalt not lie itself
[40:22] is the law of Moses
[40:24] but it represents a precept
[40:27] God cannot lie
[40:30] God cannot lie if God speaks it it
[40:34] becomes
[40:35] he's the Creator he will never
[40:37] contradict himself he's the same he
[40:39] never changes
[40:40] when he presents something he is he as
[40:43] he says I'm God I change not he presents
[40:46] something to the world and he changes
[40:48] not and he says it's represented here in
[40:50] a line Thou shalt not lie
[40:53] but if you take the line and don't have
[40:55] the precept
[40:56] the letter killeth
[40:59] well brother I've got this part I've got
[41:01] this part but do we understand the
[41:03] picture of what God is looking to
[41:05] accomplish in Us in you
[41:09] and then how do we measure it
[41:12] how do I know if I'm actually seeing a
[41:14] precept or I'm just seeing the
[41:16] instruction of God in a legalistic way
[41:20] how do I know that I'm not overstepping
[41:23] the target
[41:25] not just hitting the target
[41:28] are we
[41:29] it's so simple it's like this
[41:34] God
[41:36] there's something that's set here
[41:38] God tells you to do this
[41:40] I want you to move this over here
[41:46] God's word perfectly fulfilled
[41:51] and to us we look at it like there are
[41:52] Shades of Gray did I do it right I'm
[41:54] insecure about it and God said just do
[41:56] this
[41:57] and move it there
[42:00] we may not understand all of it
[42:03] we may not know understand how it fits
[42:05] in a bigger picture
[42:07] but God just said do this from here and
[42:10] move it there
[42:12] and we do it
[42:14] that's representing something bigger
[42:19] there's a precept that God is expressing
[42:23] he will do it in your life he will do it
[42:25] in the situations that are taking place
[42:27] in the assembly
[42:28] he is presenting his precept
[42:33] and it's
[42:35] friends I tell you what
[42:37] the simplest things are the hardest
[42:39] things to preach
[42:42] what I see right now I see a picture
[42:44] that's so simple it's difficult to
[42:46] express it in words but it's so simple
[42:49] let us continue looking at what brother
[42:51] Branham is saying here
[42:54] don't presume believe don't venture out
[42:58] without Authority without scriptural
[43:00] Authority Samson presumed oh well my oh
[43:05] I know I I've I can't I can't get my
[43:07] locks anymore but I presume it's all
[43:10] right
[43:11] I'm still the same old guy
[43:15] I'm you know I I'm really I'm really a
[43:18] good person
[43:20] I made you know I
[43:23] I it was just a little mistake and here
[43:25] Samson we know what samsa does and he
[43:27] goes and he does what all the things
[43:30] that transpired and what is in his heart
[43:32] is
[43:34] I'm following the law
[43:37] I'm fulfilling it
[43:39] he thinks this but when he misses the
[43:42] precept he's now a million miles off but
[43:45] he thinks he's right there
[43:47] he's presuming he's stepping without
[43:49] Authority and there are times friends
[43:51] when we we take God's word and we want
[43:53] to step out in in life and we want to
[43:55] make decisions in life but we're
[43:56] stepping out without the authority of
[43:59] God's instruction but God gave this
[44:01] instruction to someone else and we know
[44:04] that when God does it one way he does it
[44:05] the same all the time yes again then why
[44:08] are we not all boat builders
[44:12] right
[44:13] but he does it the same all the time yes
[44:16] but what he does the same all the time
[44:18] is the precept the character within the
[44:20] instruction
[44:22] and we look at the instruction and we
[44:24] take the instruction and we miss by a
[44:26] million miles God's a desire God's
[44:30] precept that he's looking to express
[44:31] because we're following the instruction
[44:33] but the instruction isn't Meant For Us
[44:39] a million miles off
[44:42] how can we possibly understand
[44:45] how can we possibly have confidence in
[44:48] God's word is it the instruction maybe
[44:50] the instruction was given to a certain
[44:52] person I'll give you another example of
[44:53] this
[44:55] let's say you have two people that are
[44:57] they grow up in different ways and
[45:00] for one of them there's a temptation
[45:03] and they they really if they're just
[45:04] around us at all they're pulled into it
[45:06] it's a temptation to them for the next
[45:07] person it's not a temptation
[45:09] God will press on that one person you
[45:12] stay away from that stuff completely
[45:13] don't go anywhere near it
[45:16] and for the next person God says you go
[45:19] this way and they don't even think about
[45:21] it but they're in the presence of those
[45:22] things that are evil
[45:24] and it's a it's a it's a real temptation
[45:26] to this other person so here is this
[45:28] person's just walking along and the
[45:30] other person that God said you stay away
[45:31] from that stuff they look at the other
[45:33] person and say wow you hypocrite
[45:36] I heard the instruction of God God told
[45:39] me to stay away from that
[45:42] and look at you you look at you walking
[45:43] so close to that look at you doing all
[45:46] those things and that person is innocent
[45:47] in their heart they're not tempted by it
[45:50] they walk right by it and they're not
[45:51] tempted by it
[45:53] but the instruction given to one that
[45:55] person makes an assumption
[45:59] that God gave the same instruction to
[46:01] the other person
[46:03] they missed the precept
[46:06] in what God is giving them
[46:09] God was protecting them in the
[46:11] instruction they were given there's a
[46:13] precept the precept changes not
[46:16] God does not change he never changes his
[46:18] precept because the precept is his
[46:22] character
[46:25] he never changes the precept
[46:29] he takes the truth we look at the the
[46:31] message of Luther
[46:34] was a tremendous man he was a mighty man
[46:38] of mighty man of God in his age
[46:40] he stood up against the Catholic church
[46:42] we know that he split the world wide
[46:44] wide open the the anointing that was
[46:46] upon him the the ministry of Luther
[46:48] brought the world out of the Dark Ages
[46:52] you realize that split the world wide
[46:55] open there was no church there was no
[46:57] there was no uh Christian religion
[47:00] outside of the Catholic Church
[47:03] and he takes a step and and he he
[47:07] splits the world or splits the religious
[47:09] World open
[47:10] but you can't go back and say well I'm
[47:12] going to take the life of Luther and
[47:14] apply it to the day that I'm living in
[47:17] he hated Jews he wanted to kill all the
[47:19] Jews
[47:20] he hated if he believed that if someone
[47:23] rose up against the the king that they
[47:25] should be killed
[47:27] he was
[47:29] he was bearing the light of the day the
[47:32] moment that he's living in
[47:36] now the light that was there
[47:38] the light that was there the life that
[47:41] was there
[47:42] was of God
[47:44] I am God and I change not
[47:47] the life that is there with Luther moves
[47:49] on to the next day
[47:52] but what does the world do
[47:55] God told me to go this way I'm following
[47:58] Luther
[47:59] praise the Lord I'm following Luther I'm
[48:01] free of the Catholic church and they're
[48:03] walking walking and God says turn right
[48:07] I've got another messenger his name is
[48:09] Wesley and they come up to the edge
[48:11] [Music]
[48:12] yeah but I really like going this way
[48:15] off the edge they go
[48:18] right
[48:20] they heard the instruction
[48:23] but they missed the precept
[48:26] they came right up to the edge and God
[48:28] said now it's a change of instruction
[48:30] they may not understand the whole
[48:32] precept but the instruction changes and
[48:35] they deny the instruction of God and in
[48:38] it they deny the precept of God
[48:43] this is important friends because we may
[48:45] never understand as we sit here today we
[48:48] are never going to understand
[48:49] individually
[48:51] every one of God's instructions
[48:55] I can say that because the Bible says to
[48:57] each is given a Measure of Faith
[49:02] but you might be given part you're given
[49:05] part you're given part you're given part
[49:06] the body is representing the precepts of
[49:10] God
[49:12] the fullness of God's thoughts the
[49:14] fullness of God's precepts are presented
[49:17] in a body walking on the shores of
[49:20] Galilee
[49:22] here's a little man that comes walking
[49:23] and he just looks kind of rough and he's
[49:25] he's not much to look at it and yet all
[49:28] of God's precepts are represented in
[49:30] that one body
[49:32] that one natural body
[49:36] here in the last days
[49:39] God is looking to present all of his
[49:42] precepts in one body
[49:46] he said you are my body
[49:49] you're my hands you are my feet
[49:55] we get the instruction of God God gives
[49:57] you instruction to do such and such
[50:00] more than anything more than any
[50:02] contention
[50:03] more than any any other anything that
[50:06] causes contention more than anything
[50:08] that causes disagreement
[50:10] I have seen Time After Time where God
[50:13] has given instruction
[50:15] and it is taken as a precept
[50:18] and applied to everything that someone
[50:19] has seen
[50:22] and suddenly
[50:24] if you don't believe like me you're out
[50:30] but here's the thing friend
[50:32] the instruction to them might have been
[50:33] of God
[50:36] this is where things get so fine down
[50:41] so to speak we're splitting hairs
[50:45] because God gives an instruction to an
[50:47] individual and they're walking in the
[50:49] instruction that God gave them but that
[50:51] instruction was not for everyone
[50:54] but in the instruction was a precept
[50:58] in the line was a precept
[51:02] let's take another example of that
[51:04] I stand here today as a minister of the
[51:06] Gospel is everyone here today called to
[51:09] be a preacher
[51:12] to preach from behind a Pulpit
[51:14] no of course not
[51:18] each call to a part I have a line that I
[51:23] have to fulfill
[51:24] God called me to fulfill a role a time a
[51:28] place you stand here you do this
[51:31] but then God is calling you each of you
[51:34] that God is calling that God is pulling
[51:36] on he's calling you to fulfill a
[51:38] specific line
[51:41] well brother Nathaniel you're talking
[51:43] about the body working together again
[51:45] this is something that's always on my
[51:46] heart why is it because as you get in
[51:49] place as an individual as you're walking
[51:51] with the Lord the very next thing that
[51:53] begins to happen is God begins to put
[51:55] you in context in place
[51:59] it's no longer just about you
[52:01] it's line upon line
[52:04] precept upon precept
[52:07] as you're being being uh God is calling
[52:10] you he's pulling you to be in place you
[52:12] begin to work with others you begin to
[52:13] see others how can that happen when you
[52:17] think if you are perceiving that the
[52:19] instruction that God gave you is exactly
[52:21] the same instruction as the next person
[52:25] this is so confusing
[52:28] has been confusing over the years and
[52:31] has caused so much strife
[52:34] well God gave me instruction
[52:36] God give me different instruction
[52:39] well that can't be of God
[52:41] can't give you one instruction give me a
[52:43] different instruction
[52:44] that means that God changes no
[52:48] no it doesn't
[52:50] because within the instruction is a
[52:53] precept
[52:54] within the instruction is the mind of
[52:57] God and what you are expressing together
[53:01] is the mind of God
[53:04] one part is doing one part another part
[53:06] is doing another part
[53:17] now that's something that the church
[53:19] must not do
[53:20] you're not sure of yourself if you're
[53:22] just presuming for you're taking it for
[53:24] granted
[53:26] don't presume
[53:28] believe
[53:29] don't venture out without Authority
[53:31] without scriptural Authority Samson
[53:33] presumed oh well am I I ain't got my
[53:38] locks anymore but I presume it's all
[53:39] right I'm still the same old guy
[53:43] no no brother you've crossed the
[53:46] separating line
[53:48] he presumed he had just as much strength
[53:51] and said I'll just stretch myself I'll
[53:53] just stretch myself I'll just stretch
[53:55] out a little bit oh now I just I'm just
[53:58] as good a man as I ever was but he found
[54:00] that his strength was gone
[54:06] friends there's so much instability and
[54:07] the young people that are let's let's go
[54:09] back to this again the younger ones that
[54:12] are sitting here today when I was your
[54:14] age when I was 19 20 21 years old I
[54:17] hated that stage of life so much
[54:20] because all I wanted was to be confident
[54:22] I wanted to know where I fit and I
[54:24] didn't know where I fit
[54:25] and it ate me up inside it tore me up
[54:29] but these the things that the things
[54:31] that the Lord began to teach me as I I
[54:33] stand here today it's now been these
[54:35] years and I look back and I watch how
[54:38] the Lord was teaching me to walk not by
[54:40] sight but by faith
[54:42] to walk by faith in his word and to be
[54:44] confident to stand here today and and
[54:46] stumble through trying to explain
[54:47] something that's so difficult to explain
[54:49] but it's so valuable it's so treasured
[54:52] that if by the grace of God we can catch
[54:54] a glimpse of it it helps us to stand
[54:56] with confidence
[54:58] and when when we're trying to find our
[55:01] place in life and this is true of not
[55:02] just the younger ones but older ones
[55:04] trying to find a place in life you have
[55:06] to find the instruction of God for you
[55:10] that's hard
[55:12] that's hard
[55:14] because you have to understand that the
[55:17] instruction for you is maybe different
[55:19] than the next person
[55:21] God called each one to a different place
[55:24] and that means it's different the
[55:26] details might look different but within
[55:28] it is a precept
[55:31] and the precept never changes
[55:37] the instruction might be specific for
[55:39] the date and time but within it is God
[55:41] expressing something
[55:43] no no brother if you go beyond that no
[55:46] no you've crossed the separating line he
[55:48] presumed that he had just as much
[55:49] strength
[55:51] now let's go to II Peter the first
[55:54] chapter
[56:09] we want to take this
[56:13] these thoughts and and apply it and look
[56:15] at it as an example
[56:33] you find your place there just say Amen
[56:35] if you would
[56:38] I was talking to brother Jeremy last
[56:40] night and he mentioned that Brother Kyle
[56:42] had preached on
[56:44] perfect love God to love on Wednesday
[56:48] and I told brother Jeremy at the time I
[56:50] said well you you can be a witness to me
[56:52] that these things some of these things
[56:53] were in my notes and they're not because
[56:55] of what Kyle preached Brother Kyle
[56:57] preached on Wednesday
[56:59] so if we're looking at any things that
[57:01] that tie and continue that thought from
[57:03] Wednesday that was not intentional
[57:05] that's just the Lord doing that
[57:09] second Peter
[57:12] the first chapter let's read verses 2 to
[57:14] 11.
[57:16] foreign
[57:18] Grace and peace be multiplied
[57:21] unto you through the knowledge of God of
[57:24] our Lord Jesus of Jesus our lord
[57:27] according as his divine power hath given
[57:29] unto us all the things that pertain unto
[57:31] life and godliness
[57:33] through the knowledge of him that hath
[57:35] called us to glory and virtue
[57:38] whereby are we given unto us whereby are
[57:42] given unto us exceeding great and
[57:43] precious promises that by these
[57:46] you might be partakers of the divine
[57:49] nature having escaped the corruption
[57:51] that is in the world through lust and
[57:54] besides this giving all diligence
[57:56] added to your faith virtue
[57:59] and to your virtue knowledge
[58:03] we're going to stop there just for a
[58:05] moment
[58:09] if we look at this subject and let's
[58:12] take this
[58:15] this thought of
[58:16] the Capstone is
[58:18] love divine love
[58:26] verse number seven into godliness
[58:28] Brotherhood of kindness into brotherly
[58:29] kindness charity or love
[58:33] the top of this is love
[58:37] this is how simple that God gives us his
[58:40] precepts
[58:41] now we can look at this and say is this
[58:43] instruction
[58:44] is this a precept of God and this is
[58:47] both this is a precept of God and
[58:50] this is the instruction of God
[58:53] he says add to your faith virtue
[58:57] there's this one element of this that I
[58:59] want to focus on
[59:01] add
[59:03] to
[59:04] your faith
[59:08] add to your faith
[59:13] everyone that is sitting here today
[59:16] you can read through these scriptures
[59:18] and by the grace of God you can find
[59:20] where you are
[59:22] in these instructions
[59:25] all of us here today are somewhere
[59:28] on our journey growing in the Lord
[59:31] Within These instructions
[59:35] add to your faith virtue
[59:39] well brother
[59:42] I've heard this before
[59:44] I don't mean to criticize anyone but
[59:46] this is this is really what has been
[59:48] said
[59:50] go through the instructions of God and
[59:54] and someone might present this as an
[59:56] idea that well we live in this age so
[59:58] I'm going to go straight to Divine love
[1:00:01] is you know the message is here God is
[1:00:04] doing such a mighty work
[1:00:05] so I'm just going to go right to the
[1:00:07] Capstone I'm going to go right to
[1:00:09] I I believe I believe that this is the
[1:00:11] truth and and God is love and therefore
[1:00:15] I'm going to be full of love and I'm
[1:00:16] just going to be
[1:00:18] I'm going to epitomize everything that
[1:00:20] God is intending
[1:00:23] but God gave instruction here
[1:00:26] he said add to your faith virtue
[1:00:29] virtuous strength
[1:00:32] add to your faith what happens if you
[1:00:34] don't have faith
[1:00:38] how much love can you have if you don't
[1:00:41] have faith
[1:00:43] none
[1:00:45] how much virtue can you have how much
[1:00:47] strength can you have if you have no
[1:00:48] faith
[1:00:50] none
[1:00:53] how much knowledge can you have if you
[1:00:54] don't have virtue
[1:00:56] none
[1:00:59] because God said
[1:01:01] add to
[1:01:04] see as God is building throughout the
[1:01:06] church ages his church age upon Church
[1:01:08] ages things that have been building
[1:01:10] in you God is looking to do the exact
[1:01:12] same thing
[1:01:14] a principle a precept of God is that he
[1:01:17] is building line upon line and
[1:01:19] everywhere that God is building he's
[1:01:21] doing the same thing
[1:01:23] in the ages God is doing it in the age
[1:01:26] that we're living in the hour that we're
[1:01:27] living in God is doing it God is doing
[1:01:29] it in you as an individual if God is
[1:01:32] working in you he is building something
[1:01:36] I don't believe it's a coincidence that
[1:01:37] the first message that we have recorded
[1:01:39] is Faith is a substance
[1:01:43] go back and listen to that message and
[1:01:45] really carefully go through what brother
[1:01:47] random is talking about
[1:01:48] and see if your faith measures up
[1:01:51] measures up to what brother Branham is
[1:01:52] referring to
[1:01:56] I would challenge that sometimes our
[1:01:58] understanding of how how Faith even
[1:02:00] works
[1:02:02] doesn't align with what brother Brandon
[1:02:03] described
[1:02:06] he said God God has a faith Satan does
[1:02:09] it does things God does things and he
[1:02:11] said well who's doing that who's making
[1:02:13] those things move and he says neither
[1:02:15] one that's me
[1:02:17] that's me
[1:02:19] as an individual
[1:02:21] his faith was accomplishing something
[1:02:27] and if you've been born in a message
[1:02:29] Church born raised
[1:02:32] you might be a wonderful person
[1:02:35] much better person than you could look
[1:02:37] around and and maybe you measure up to
[1:02:39] be better than the people around you the
[1:02:40] Bible says compare not yourselves among
[1:02:42] yourselves
[1:02:43] but if you look around well you know I'm
[1:02:45] a pretty good person I'm a pretty good
[1:02:47] person
[1:02:50] but if you don't have faith there's
[1:02:52] nothing to build on
[1:02:54] there's nowhere to go
[1:02:56] there's nothing to add to
[1:02:59] if you don't have virtue knowledge
[1:03:02] brother Branham explained this knowledge
[1:03:04] is when something you have applied your
[1:03:07] faith something has taken place it's no
[1:03:09] longer Faith it's knowledge
[1:03:12] I now know it I don't have to say well
[1:03:15] you know I believe that God Is A Healer
[1:03:17] God Is A Healer it's knowledge to me
[1:03:19] I've seen it
[1:03:21] it's now knowledge I've built upon by
[1:03:24] the grace of God faith
[1:03:26] than virtue
[1:03:28] I'm seeing it take place and as God is
[1:03:31] looking that you would grow up in the
[1:03:33] Lord he's building line upon line
[1:03:36] precept upon precept within you
[1:03:38] and to just read the words it's not what
[1:03:41] God is after God is is after having a
[1:03:44] private conversation with you so that
[1:03:47] you can understand where you are and
[1:03:49] this is the beautiful part friends
[1:03:51] that when God identifies you and he
[1:03:54] identifies you in the scripture
[1:03:57] you just take
[1:04:01] it's like this
[1:04:02] when God identifies you in the scripture
[1:04:04] like we use the example we're walking
[1:04:06] along
[1:04:06] and we come to the edge of the
[1:04:08] instruction that God has given us
[1:04:10] and God is God is dealing with you in
[1:04:12] your life and you say well Lord I want
[1:04:14] to know what the next step is if you
[1:04:17] read the scriptures and it's just
[1:04:19] instruction and there's this one and
[1:04:21] there's this one and there are many
[1:04:22] things in the Old Testament that I don't
[1:04:24] understand
[1:04:25] there are many types and shadows that
[1:04:26] are taking place I don't understand them
[1:04:29] but there are precepts that are being
[1:04:31] represented and if I understand the
[1:04:32] precept I can follow the precept and
[1:04:35] when when I come to a place and God is
[1:04:37] pointing out
[1:04:38] he says now son
[1:04:41] this is where you're at in your walk
[1:04:44] okay Lord I believe it
[1:04:48] I may not be representing everything
[1:04:49] that God wants me to represent quite yet
[1:04:52] but I'm headed in that direction
[1:04:54] and when I find I've been looking at the
[1:04:56] Lord sits me down and I just kind of
[1:04:58] narrate it this way he says now son you
[1:05:01] got these weaknesses in your life
[1:05:03] and I look at those weaknesses and I say
[1:05:05] well Lord I want to know what to do next
[1:05:08] what do I do
[1:05:10] the Lord begins to deal with this and
[1:05:11] he'll set you where you are in Scripture
[1:05:14] and this is the beautiful thing
[1:05:16] when God sets you in the scripture do
[1:05:18] you know what to do you know what to to
[1:05:20] how to find out what to do next
[1:05:22] well Lord I stopped I don't want to go
[1:05:24] any farther your instruction told me to
[1:05:25] come this far I don't want to go any
[1:05:27] further what do I do
[1:05:29] and God shows you where in the art you
[1:05:31] are in the scripture and he says now now
[1:05:32] read the next verse
[1:05:35] and if you've caught the mind of God
[1:05:38] if God has pointed you to where you are
[1:05:40] in the scripture you read the next
[1:05:42] verses
[1:05:43] and it simply tells you what to do
[1:05:48] you find yourself in the pattern of God
[1:05:50] you simply follow
[1:05:53] pattern
[1:05:55] and God is looking at his precepts are
[1:05:58] so personal so real to us
[1:06:01] that he puts you in a situation
[1:06:05] he'll put you in a trial
[1:06:08] he'll put you in a place where you're
[1:06:10] under tremendous pressure
[1:06:13] and in that situation you say well Lord
[1:06:15] what do I do what do I do and he says
[1:06:19] what do you think
[1:06:21] but Lord I don't know
[1:06:23] he says but I've been teaching you
[1:06:26] you've come through trials you come
[1:06:28] through situations
[1:06:31] what did he say to Moses Moses
[1:06:34] I had you on the back side of the desert
[1:06:37] you already went through your education
[1:06:39] you're standing before this great
[1:06:41] challenge before you Moses
[1:06:44] why are you crying
[1:06:47] Moses why cry
[1:06:49] speak
[1:06:52] he had been going through his lessons
[1:06:54] he's learning he's growing through his
[1:06:56] lessons just like you were going through
[1:06:57] your lessons God is teaching us we're
[1:06:59] teaching us oh brother I'm in this trial
[1:07:02] and I just I come out of the trial and I
[1:07:05] go right back into another trial it's
[1:07:07] it's almost the same thing over and over
[1:07:09] and over again
[1:07:11] right because you haven't learned a
[1:07:13] lesson yet
[1:07:15] you want to stop going through the same
[1:07:17] trial
[1:07:18] learn the lesson
[1:07:20] you learn the lesson what do you do in
[1:07:22] school
[1:07:23] you pass the grade what do you do you go
[1:07:24] to the next lesson
[1:07:26] and once in a while the devil or the the
[1:07:28] devil will come along and the Lord will
[1:07:30] allow it the Lord allows the lesson to
[1:07:32] come along again and as that lesson
[1:07:34] comes along it you know years ago or
[1:07:36] maybe last week you go through the same
[1:07:39] situation and suddenly you're like
[1:07:41] yeah I mean I see it happening but it's
[1:07:44] fine it's okay
[1:07:47] and someone else has worked up they said
[1:07:48] well what why aren't you why aren't you
[1:07:51] disturbed by this why aren't you
[1:07:52] bothered
[1:07:53] because I've already been through that
[1:07:56] I already learned that precept
[1:07:59] where I'm standing that no longer
[1:08:01] matters
[1:08:02] it doesn't matter anymore
[1:08:05] what trial I'm going through what
[1:08:06] situation I'm going through it no longer
[1:08:08] matters because where I'm standing is
[1:08:11] clearly identified in God's precepts
[1:08:15] I'm standing so clearly
[1:08:17] not just following the instruction
[1:08:20] and and I hope that that makes sense
[1:08:22] today
[1:08:23] the instruction of God to one again we
[1:08:26] use the example of Noah we're not all
[1:08:28] boat builders
[1:08:31] we're not all boat Builders we're not
[1:08:33] all doing exactly the things that
[1:08:35] someone else in another age has done but
[1:08:36] there was a precept that was represented
[1:08:40] and God never changes he's building
[1:08:43] precept upon precept upon precept
[1:08:48] if we're standing in those things
[1:08:52] there is no contention
[1:08:55] there is nothing to argue about
[1:08:58] there is no strength
[1:09:02] why because we're standing
[1:09:05] not in the
[1:09:07] the details uh what comes to mind is I
[1:09:10] don't know if you've ever seen a
[1:09:13] H this is a
[1:09:15] anyone work with mathematics at all
[1:09:19] I know not very popular is it
[1:09:23] it's got a bad rap
[1:09:27] anyone seen those little they have a
[1:09:29] chart and they have all these dots on it
[1:09:31] you ever see that
[1:09:32] how they all these these dots on a chart
[1:09:35] and all it is is a bunch of dots
[1:09:38] but what's interesting is that all of
[1:09:40] those random seemingly random points
[1:09:44] if you analyze them you look at them I
[1:09:48] just say it this way if you analyze them
[1:09:49] you can draw a line that represents
[1:09:52] where all of those dots are pointing to
[1:09:55] it would call it a trend line
[1:09:57] and there's this line through all what
[1:09:59] seems like chaos there's a line that
[1:10:02] balances it all out there's a line that
[1:10:05] interprets what seems like chaos
[1:10:07] and the world that we live in seems like
[1:10:10] chaos and times when you're trying
[1:10:12] you're praying about God I want to apply
[1:10:14] your word to to my life it seems like
[1:10:16] chaos
[1:10:18] but when God begins to open it in what
[1:10:20] seems like this piece here in this
[1:10:22] sermon and that sort of I don't I didn't
[1:10:24] understand that sermon at all
[1:10:25] I didn't understand what was said here I
[1:10:28] didn't understand what was said there
[1:10:29] but Lord I feel like I don't understand
[1:10:32] what you're telling me and and God has
[1:10:35] just given you a puzzle piece it gives
[1:10:37] you a puzzle piece it gives you a puzzle
[1:10:39] piece and the date comes when he says
[1:10:40] all right
[1:10:41] now let me bring it all together for you
[1:10:44] and God just lays it out
[1:10:47] and the picture comes together
[1:10:50] oh
[1:10:51] it seems random but it's not
[1:10:55] I'm reading this line and I'm reading
[1:10:57] that line and I'm reading all these
[1:10:58] details but through all of it God is
[1:11:01] bringing together a picture and right
[1:11:03] through all of it God brings together a
[1:11:05] picture in your life and you begin to
[1:11:07] see it oh
[1:11:09] I thought I understood all of these
[1:11:11] lines I understood all these details
[1:11:13] but in the midst of it
[1:11:17] God was presenting a precept
[1:11:22] we can read the front of the book
[1:11:25] and study
[1:11:27] and analyze
[1:11:29] and try to understand what God is saying
[1:11:32] but we cannot break our way into the
[1:11:35] back of the book
[1:11:37] we have to look at the instruction that
[1:11:39] God is giving to us individually each
[1:11:41] one that's sitting here today
[1:11:43] you look at the instruction that God has
[1:11:45] given you
[1:11:48] and build line upon line
[1:11:52] precept upon precept
[1:11:54] by God's grace is God is God is doing
[1:11:57] the work when God begins to bring the
[1:11:59] pictures together
[1:12:01] the precept is what he's after
[1:12:04] he's looking to present
[1:12:08] my I wish I had a grander way to say it
[1:12:14] we take those things and we take them so
[1:12:17] so limited
[1:12:19] the grandness of God's word
[1:12:22] is so astounding
[1:12:26] I'm just going to say it like this for
[1:12:28] you today saying
[1:12:33] if you have a question before God or you
[1:12:35] have something that you're praying about
[1:12:38] God has been writing all of these lines
[1:12:43] brother random gave us a wonderful story
[1:12:45] a little example of this is
[1:12:47] a letter that was written to him you
[1:12:49] know if a lever letter was written for
[1:12:51] his wife from his wife
[1:12:52] he said anyone else could read that
[1:12:54] letter
[1:12:56] but I'm the only one that reads between
[1:12:58] the lines
[1:13:00] I'm the only one that's used the
[1:13:02] teardrop
[1:13:05] and God is writing your line your life
[1:13:08] lying upon line
[1:13:12] but as he begins to bring out what he
[1:13:14] intends to express the meaning in the
[1:13:17] words
[1:13:18] is bigger than the words
[1:13:21] how is it that brother Branham might say
[1:13:24] something he might you know misstate a
[1:13:27] fact or something to that effect and
[1:13:29] people will jump on that how is it that
[1:13:31] he can make
[1:13:33] such a what seems like an error but then
[1:13:35] also be speaking the truth
[1:13:39] because the message the precept that's
[1:13:41] being presented
[1:13:42] is greater than that
[1:13:45] we can fumble around and we stumble
[1:13:47] around and we try to do things for God
[1:13:48] and we make mistakes
[1:13:50] but in it God is presenting something
[1:13:52] that's greater than the sum of all of
[1:13:54] our mistakes
[1:13:56] it's greater than the sum of anything
[1:13:58] that we're striving to do as an
[1:13:59] individual and again for the younger
[1:14:01] ones here God is is doing something can
[1:14:04] be doing something in you if that's your
[1:14:06] desire
[1:14:07] can be doing something in you that's so
[1:14:09] great
[1:14:10] that God will establish you and it's
[1:14:13] personal to you God's not going to make
[1:14:14] this big show
[1:14:16] it's not going to be something that
[1:14:18] everyone's like you're a super Christian
[1:14:22] God's not looking to do that
[1:14:26] but God is looking to in you you said
[1:14:28] you want miracles to happen you want
[1:14:30] something miraculous to take place in
[1:14:31] your life if God does it it'll be done
[1:14:33] in private
[1:14:36] and then you want to go tell someone
[1:14:37] else and you can't
[1:14:39] you can tell them about it and they look
[1:14:41] at you I was talking to a brother on the
[1:14:43] way to service this morning we're
[1:14:44] talking about the world that we're
[1:14:45] living in people could look at the
[1:14:47] Miracles of God God could do something
[1:14:49] it you know the blind could see that the
[1:14:51] lame could walk and the world would look
[1:14:53] at it and say
[1:14:54] huh
[1:14:57] I
[1:14:59] I don't believe that
[1:15:01] or how did that happen
[1:15:04] couldn't have been God
[1:15:06] Show Me A Sign show me a sign and a sign
[1:15:08] is shown and you see I don't believe it
[1:15:11] God's not doing that for the world
[1:15:15] what God is looking to build in US is
[1:15:18] confidence
[1:15:20] only going as far as the word has
[1:15:23] described for us to go and no further
[1:15:27] because it's already perfect
[1:15:32] line upon line precept upon precept
[1:15:37] I'm going to invite the musicians to
[1:15:39] come
[1:15:56] and invite you all to stand if you would
[1:15:58] with me
[1:16:01] foreign
[1:16:17] you love the Lord today
[1:16:20] if we can sing that little song let your
[1:16:23] word be born
[1:16:25] in the manger of my heart
[1:16:30] friends there are so many there's so
[1:16:32] much spiritual work that needs to be
[1:16:34] done
[1:16:36] when I look at myself and I say Lord I
[1:16:39] want to be living your precepts every
[1:16:41] day
[1:16:42] I want to when I when I speak when I
[1:16:44] live when I walk when I go to work I
[1:16:46] want to live your precepts
[1:16:49] the very Mind Of God I want to do those
[1:16:51] things so badly but how do I get there
[1:16:55] how do I take one step with confidence
[1:16:59] how do I just move forward and never be
[1:17:02] swayed how do I move forward and and you
[1:17:05] know there are times where people will
[1:17:06] if you stand for God people will
[1:17:08] disagree with you
[1:17:09] but it doesn't mean that we're
[1:17:10] disagreeable
[1:17:13] we want to be
[1:17:14] truly with the love of God as God is
[1:17:16] building in us as we saw there in second
[1:17:19] Peter
[1:17:21] we want to get to truly Divine love
[1:17:25] different than what people think about
[1:17:26] it I'm not going to I'll save that for
[1:17:31] by the grace of God the brothers will
[1:17:32] continue to minister them that I'm sure
[1:17:36] but those these things are different
[1:17:37] than what people imagine
[1:17:39] and the reason why they can't they can't
[1:17:42] go there they don't have a vision of it
[1:17:44] is because they're trying to apply their
[1:17:47] understanding they're trying to apply
[1:17:48] the lines they're trying to apply their
[1:17:51] natural understanding of the scriptures
[1:17:52] and the natural understanding of the
[1:17:54] scriptures cannot produce God's precepts
[1:18:00] I will say today friends I wish I had a
[1:18:03] a grand way to express this it's just
[1:18:06] what's in my heart it's so simple it's
[1:18:08] it's hard because it's simple
[1:18:11] foreign
[1:18:13] but it really comes down to Absolute
[1:18:16] obedience
[1:18:18] to whatever God says
[1:18:21] never going any further
[1:18:24] never going short never going left never
[1:18:28] going right
[1:18:29] when God lays it out to hit exactly what
[1:18:32] he says
[1:18:33] and in that friends we can walk in such
[1:18:36] confidence that when Satan comes and
[1:18:39] tempts us
[1:18:41] we have an anchor that's so strong
[1:18:44] that were not even affected by it
[1:18:48] we're not even affected
[1:18:51] by the things that are going on in the
[1:18:53] world around us
[1:18:55] let's sing this little song
[1:18:58] [Music]
[1:19:18] that is
[1:19:21] [Music]
[1:19:31] [Music]
[1:19:38] [Music]

[1:20:21] can we sing this little song the battle
[1:20:24] is the Lord's
[1:20:29] I appreciate
[1:20:31] appreciate hope that's all right
[1:20:34] [Music]
[1:20:42] if there is a
[1:20:45] source

[1:21:32] burden
[1:21:42] the battle is the Lord
[1:21:51] 's my name
[1:21:59] all the ways
[1:22:26] your strength is gone
[1:22:32] foreign
[1:22:44] [Music]
[1:23:04] so
[1:23:06] remember
[1:23:19] when the waters rise
[1:23:44] amazing
[1:23:55] time
[1:24:00] is gone
[1:24:16] foreign
[1:24:17] [Music]
[1:24:25] [Music]
[1:24:46] take her
[1:24:48] [Music]
[1:24:54] as they play that just very reverently
[1:24:56] before the Lord
[1:24:56] [Music]
[1:25:01] when the roads you walk
[1:25:06] when all the things seem just piled up
[1:25:10] and all the way that life has to offer
[1:25:13] [Music]
[1:25:16] those times
[1:25:17] our God is still an ever-present help in
[1:25:20] the time of need
[1:25:23] let us go before the Lord once again in
[1:25:25] prayer
[1:25:27] and ask that God will
[1:25:29] do what no man can do
[1:25:33] lead us and guide us
[1:25:36] and do only his perfect will
[1:25:39] you know the years ago
[1:25:43] I remember it was said
[1:25:48] if you pray you know Lord do whatever it
[1:25:50] takes people would say well be careful
[1:25:52] when you pray that
[1:25:53] because you know it could be really hard
[1:25:57] but you know a friend
[1:25:59] I encourage you today
[1:26:02] just tell the Lord Lord whatever it
[1:26:04] takes
[1:26:06] my one desire is that when the trumpet
[1:26:09] sounds
[1:26:10] I'm standing there with you
[1:26:13] on the other side
[1:26:15] when we're called to gather in the air
[1:26:17] that we're caught up to meet him
[1:26:20] we if we set any priority
[1:26:25] of what we desire God said if you're
[1:26:27] ashamed of me then I'll be ashamed of
[1:26:28] you
[1:26:30] let us pray Lord Jesus
[1:26:33] [Music]
[1:26:36] there are so many Transitions and
[1:26:40] Seasons that are coming to an end
[1:26:45] God as we are here today
[1:26:49] Lord I realize more and more every day
[1:26:52] that we cannot do anything without you
[1:26:57] there's a reason why the Capstone is
[1:26:59] saying grace
[1:27:04] Lord Jesus I'll pray that you will have
[1:27:06] mercy
[1:27:08] that your grace will overflow in
[1:27:11] disassembly
[1:27:12] [Music]
[1:27:14] Lord we're not worthy in ourselves but
[1:27:16] Lord Jesus we've set aside our own
[1:27:18] thoughts
[1:27:19] and we've taken up your calls
[1:27:23] Lord we stand clean confident before you
[1:27:27] that you are doing the mighty work that
[1:27:30] you claimed
[1:27:31] that you set out to do
[1:27:34] Lord we know that you're doing it
[1:27:39] Lord I pray that you will bless these
[1:27:40] people mightily
[1:27:43] bless the Saints Lord as they're
[1:27:45] struggling sometimes in life
[1:27:48] Lord I pray that the things that we have
[1:27:50] looked at today are
[1:27:52] Lord I've stumbled over my words forgive
[1:27:54] me
[1:27:55] [Music]
[1:27:58] Lord I pray that your people will catch
[1:28:00] it anyway
[1:28:03] Lord I pray that you will make the word
[1:28:05] simple and plain
[1:28:07] that the children can understand
[1:28:11] God I pray that you will heal those that
[1:28:14] are sick
[1:28:17] pray Lord that you will lead those that
[1:28:19] are
[1:28:19] struggling to find direction
[1:28:23] God I pray that you will
[1:28:26] help us Lord in the months ahead
[1:28:30] Satan would love to destroy the work
[1:28:33] that you have set out to do
[1:28:35] but God we are trusting in you
[1:28:39] what I'm trusting in you today
[1:28:43] I pray Lord Jesus
[1:28:46] that the testimonies will abound
[1:28:50] God I pray that you will
[1:28:52] continue to have your way
[1:28:54] truly Lord may your word be born in US
[1:28:59] when the road is
[1:29:01] hard and it's weary
[1:29:04] we will remember to walk by your
[1:29:06] precepts
[1:29:08] that we would forget not the words that
[1:29:10] echo in our hearts of how faithful and
[1:29:11] true and just that you are
[1:29:15] God I pray that you will have your way
[1:29:17] this afternoon be with the Saints as
[1:29:20] they go
[1:29:22] Lord and tomorrow as we Face the week we
[1:29:24] Face the work that we have in front of

[1:29:28] them then also and bring them through
