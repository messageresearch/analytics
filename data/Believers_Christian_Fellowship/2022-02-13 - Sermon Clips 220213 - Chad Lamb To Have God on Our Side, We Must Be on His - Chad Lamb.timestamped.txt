[0:00] i love the humanity i love how brother
[0:02] brandon was a real person
[0:04] elijah was a man of like passions that
[0:05] we he felt what you feel amen
[0:08] you can you imagine fear you can imagine
[0:10] feeling what he would feel in that
[0:11] situation because he's describing
[0:13] feelings that you and i have amen what
[0:15] was he wanting to do get away from the
[0:17] pressure he was wanting to get away from
[0:18] the rejection how many people want to
[0:20] just get away from rejection and get
[0:22] away from pressure and disappear
[0:25] amen when one of your favorite
[0:27] scriptures become oh if i could take
[0:29] wings as a dove and fly him to the cleft
[0:31] of the rock amen
[0:33] we all feel that way sometimes amen but
[0:35] he didn't have that privilege he had a
[0:37] commission there was a purpose in his
[0:38] life and there's a purpose in our life
[0:40] god has not called us to go live in a
[0:42] commune somewhere and find you know a
[0:44] couple thousand acres and build our own
[0:46] commune but he's called us to be here to
[0:48] shine light in the darkest age and the
[0:50] darkness of time in the face of
[0:52] rejection and misunderstandings and
[0:53] hardships and everything else god is
[0:56] correcting us and we you know what we we
[0:58] are or we are called to hold a high
[1:00] standard because god gave us that
[1:02] standard in his word
[1:04] we are called to live for him and for
[1:06] him only and he gives us no wiggle room
[1:08] you step out of line and the rod of
[1:10] chastisement come down quickly and you
[1:12] wonder how come other people can and
[1:14] they seem to be fine but god won't let
[1:16] me get away with anything i'll tell you
[1:19] why because your life is too important
[1:20] your purpose is too critical you're here
[1:23] at the end time to be the end time bride
[1:25] the very manifestation of christ in the
[1:27] flesh of his body his bride and god will
[1:30] if you're part of that he won't let you
[1:32] get away with anything and that is the
[1:34] most wonderful thing that a christian
[1:35] can ever hear
[1:37] [Music]
[1:38] i just wanted this and i just want a
[1:40] little rest and i just wanna and he
[1:41] won't let you get away with anything
[1:45] because your commission is too important
[1:49] your purpose is too important
