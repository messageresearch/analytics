[0:00] i say unto thee thee not them to thee
[0:03] thou art peter upon this rock i'll build
[0:05] my church
[0:07] and the word peter means a stone stone
[0:09] means the confessed one or the separated
[0:11] one
[0:12] upon a certain stone upon a certain
[0:14] thing sia called out
[0:15] the church called out upon this stone
[0:17] upon this revelation
[0:19] flesh and blood never revealed it to you
[0:21] but upon this revelation
[0:22] called out group i'll build my church in
[0:25] them and all the gates of hell
[0:27] will never be able to withstand it
[0:32] why will the gates of hell not withstand
[0:33] it because you're super special
[0:36] and you're really bright you've got a
[0:39] strong willpower
[0:41] no the gates of hell will never be able
[0:43] to withstand the revelation
[0:45] because you've got a capacity a
[0:47] god-given predestinated capacity to
[0:50] catch the revelation of the word
[0:52] and the devil can't interrupt that he
[0:54] can't stop it amen he can't block the
[0:56] transmission amen
[0:57] it comes in a frequency he can't stop
[1:00] and the word goes forth and revelation
[1:02] clicks and revelation clicks and you
[1:04] hear the message you read your bible and
[1:05] click click click click click and the
[1:06] revelation is leading you and guiding
[1:08] you into all truth
[1:11] and the gates of hell cannot withstand
[1:13] that because the gates and hell tried to
[1:15] infiltrate
[1:16] amen tried to move in systemize shut
[1:19] down
[1:19] and stop the progress of revelation
[1:23] but now the gates of heaven cannot
[1:24] prevail not because of your strength
[1:26] your brightness
[1:27] your education your ability or whatever
[1:30] that's no match i mean you are no match
[1:33] for the devil and any of the
[1:35] the gifts or abilities that you have
[1:38] yourself
[1:40] but the ability to receive revelation
[1:43] is the secret key
[1:46] that the devil cannot stop
[1:50] and be with revelation in our lives
[1:54] the gates of hell will never prevail
[1:56] against us
[1:58] but we will prevail over them
[2:01] because it will be god one step at a
[2:03] time
[2:04] revelation upon revelation not we
[2:08] but me
[2:12] you as an individual me as an individual
[2:16] god leading us by his word
[2:19] and what's going to be amazing is you as
[2:21] an individual
[2:22] me as an individual and others as
[2:23] individuals are going to wind up in the
[2:26] same plot
[2:26] spot someday not because we did it
[2:29] together not because we relied on one
[2:31] another
[2:32] not because we got comfortable in the
[2:34] group or we all went together but
[2:35] because
[2:36] individually he led us all and we all
[2:39] went to the same place
