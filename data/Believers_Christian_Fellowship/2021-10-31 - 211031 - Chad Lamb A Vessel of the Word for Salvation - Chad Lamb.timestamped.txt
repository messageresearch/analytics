[8:10] speak lord
[8:11] we're asking you to come and minister

[8:37] as we yield ourselves to you
[8:39] in jesus christ's name we pray
[8:41] amen
[8:43] god bless you this morning while you're
[8:44] standing let's turn to malachi chapter
[8:47] four
[8:48] we're going to start with a familiar
[8:50] scripture and i'd like to just continue
[8:52] to thought from sunday we're ministering
[8:55] sunday on
[8:57] i think i titled it the same ministry
[8:59] and i like to call this this morning
[9:02] a vessel of the word for salvation
[9:05] a vessel of the word for salvation i
[9:07] just want to it's the same theme that we
[9:09] were looking at i just want to keep
[9:10] looking at it through the bible and ask
[9:13] god to give us a greater understanding
[9:15] all the time
[9:16] amen many of these things that we've
[9:18] talked about before but we go back
[9:20] around and we see him more clearly over
[9:22] and over again we go back to something
[9:24] we've known and all of a sudden it's new
[9:26] again and we know it in a greater way
[9:29] and so we want to look at these things
[9:30] that way
[9:31] malachi chapter 4
[9:34] verse 5. behold i will send you elijah
[9:37] the prophet before the coming of the
[9:39] great and dreadful day of the lord and
[9:41] he shall turn the heart of the fathers
[9:43] to the children and the heart of the
[9:44] children to their fathers lest i come
[9:47] and smite the earth with a curse
[9:50] amen let's turn keep your hand here in
[9:52] malachi we're going to come back let's
[9:53] turn to luke 18 and read this while
[9:55] we're standing before we're seated
[9:58] luke 18
[10:02] and verse 8
[10:06] luke 18 and verse 8
[10:10] i tell you that he will avenge them
[10:12] speedily nevertheless when the son of
[10:14] man cometh shall he find faith
[10:17] on the earth
[10:18] may may the lord add the blessing to the
[10:20] reading of his word you can be seated
[10:22] and let's go back to malachi
[10:24] the question was when the son of man
[10:26] cometh we know that we live in the day
[10:28] of the coming of the son of man and the
[10:29] revealing of the son of man
[10:31] and the question is when he cometh shall
[10:33] he find faith on the earth
[10:35] and the answer i believe in my heart is
[10:37] yes amen
[10:39] he's found faith because he's planted a
[10:40] seed of faith in me to to receive him by
[10:43] faith it's all by his grace it's all by
[10:46] his master plan and when he returns
[10:48] shall he find faith and the answer is
[10:50] yes
[10:51] because of grace
[10:53] we look at malachi chapter 4 verse 6
[10:57] let's go back to 5 and read it again it
[10:59] says behold i will send you elijah the
[11:01] prophet before the coming of the great
[11:02] and dreadful day of the lord we know
[11:04] this is a prophecy of the seventh church
[11:07] age messenger the seventh angel when he
[11:09] shall come and we know this was
[11:11] fulfilled in the life of brother branham
[11:14] and when we know this prophecy is laying
[11:16] here and he's saying i will send elijah
[11:18] before the coming of the dreadful day of
[11:20] the lord and he shall turn the heart of
[11:22] the fathers to the children and the
[11:24] heart of the children to their fathers
[11:27] lest i come and smite the earth with a
[11:29] curse so we find that if god had not
[11:32] sent elijah and if that ministry had not
[11:35] turned the hearts of the children back
[11:37] amen to the fathers then he would have
[11:39] smote the earth with a curse so the very
[11:43] fact that god would send elijah the
[11:45] prophet on our day is to prevent the
[11:47] earth from being cursed from being
[11:49] smitten with the curse amen but there
[11:51] was two parts to that amen there was god
[11:53] who would have to send the ministry of
[11:55] elijah the spirit of elijah again but
[11:58] there had to be a people who could have
[11:59] their hearts turned back amen
[12:02] and it would take both to prevent the
[12:04] smiting of the earth with a curse and so
[12:06] we find out that god in order to make
[12:09] sure that his plan would continue he
[12:11] would have to in due season send the
[12:14] spirit of elijah upon one that he
[12:16] ordained to have that spirit but he
[12:18] would also have to ordain vessels that
[12:20] could receive that ministry and have
[12:22] their hearts turned back amen
[12:24] so it would take vessels of the word
[12:27] vessels that could have the word vessels
[12:29] that could receive the word amen it took
[12:32] vessels upon the earth to receive the
[12:34] ministry to receive the word to manifest
[12:36] that word amen that would be here for
[12:39] the prevention of the smiting of the
[12:40] earth with the curse
[12:43] so you are here to prevent
[12:46] the smiting of the earth with the curse
[12:52] a minute it sounds so strange but what
[12:55] are you doing amen and people they'll
[12:57] ask you all the time what do you do they
[12:58] want to know you know where do you work
[13:00] and what do you do oh i'm here to
[13:03] to believe the word to prevent the earth
[13:04] from being smitten with a curse
[13:07] try that next time you meet somebody new
[13:09] what do you do
[13:10] well i mean i'm here to prevent the
[13:12] earth from being smitten with the curse
[13:15] yeah
[13:17] let me know how that goes when you tried
[13:18] that a couple of times it should
[13:20] actually open the door for some
[13:21] interesting conversations
[13:23] we have to understand amen when we look
[13:25] at the word the word is very specific
[13:28] and the word is stating that it has a
[13:29] purpose and god has a plan amen and that
[13:32] plan is so much bigger than our carnal
[13:34] plans and our carnal ideas amen we get
[13:37] plans and we get ideas and we plan on
[13:39] where we're going to go to dinner on
[13:40] friday and who we're going to fellowship
[13:42] with on sunday and there's nothing wrong
[13:43] with those plans but god has a plan so
[13:46] much greater than that plan
[13:48] and we're here on this earth to do more
[13:50] than just those things that we're
[13:52] planning we're here to fulfill his plan
[13:54] his purpose and his purpose in having
[13:57] you here amen is to receive that spirit
[14:00] of elijah ministry so that your heart
[14:02] can be turned back to the faith of the
[14:04] pentecostal fathers so that you can
[14:06] prevent the smiting of the earth with a
[14:08] curse
[14:11] and you say well well isn't the earth
[14:13] going to be smitten with the curse no
[14:15] sir amen because there was people on the
[14:17] earth to receive that ministry there's
[14:19] not going to be smiting of the earth
[14:20] with a curse there's going to be a
[14:22] purging of the earth with fire amen
[14:24] that's not a curse that's a cleaning
[14:26] amen
[14:27] and the earth is looking forward to that
[14:30] cleaning amen it's groaning waiting for
[14:32] the manifestation of the sons of god
[14:34] it's it's wanting to come to that
[14:36] cleaning to burn sin off amen to
[14:39] reestablish righteousness the earth amen
[14:42] is an attribute of god then there's a
[14:43] memory in the earth amen and i hope
[14:46] you'll forgive me for saying that but
[14:47] this earth amen remembers what it was
[14:50] amen under adam's rule in perfection
[14:53] when he had his when he had his kingdom
[14:55] set up in eden in the garden of eden and
[14:57] everything was as it should be and when
[15:00] adam fell it threw the world into chaos
[15:02] amen and it's the same world
[15:05] the same elements amen that were in
[15:07] perfection have been thrown into chaos
[15:09] but the earth is groaning all creation
[15:12] is groaning for the manifestation of the
[15:14] sons of god
[15:16] what are they groaning for there must be
[15:18] something that the earth knows
[15:23] amen this is the language of the bible
[15:26] we know that
[15:28] god made the earth with his spoken word
[15:30] amen and he refashioned it in genesis by
[15:33] his word and
[15:35] the earth is also an attribute of him
[15:37] we know that the earth is also saved
[15:42] it sounds odd but the earth is also
[15:44] saved it's redeemed
[15:46] he shed his blood to redeem amen not
[15:48] just you and i but he also redeemed the
[15:50] earth
[15:54] so if there had not been a vessel
[15:57] of the word that god could come and
[15:59] anoint with the
[16:01] with the spirit of elijah
[16:03] and if there had not been vessels of the
[16:05] word that could receive that that
[16:08] ministry and have their hearts turned
[16:09] back
[16:10] then this earth would be cursed but but
[16:12] god will not allow his attribute god
[16:15] will not allow amen
[16:17] the product of his mind of his thinking
[16:19] to be cursed amen so he made sure there
[16:22] was a vessel that could receive that
[16:24] ministry and there were vessels that
[16:26] hearts could be turned back amen so that
[16:28] there could be redemption so your very
[16:30] existence amen has something to do with
[16:32] the redemption of the earth
[16:37] so it's always what i find when i read
[16:39] the bible the message has come to
[16:42] illuminate this word to open our
[16:43] understanding so we can see it's so much
[16:46] bigger than what we thought it was
[16:48] because it wasn't for this message we'd
[16:50] be comfortable living such a narrow
[16:51] vision small life
[16:54] with such a narrow focus amen our focus
[16:56] would be just it would be we would be
[16:58] self-centered we'd be self-focused and
[17:00] we'd be trying to do the best we can to
[17:02] behave the best way we can to act right
[17:05] amen and make sure everything in our
[17:06] circle is right and we would be
[17:08] constantly uh inwardly focused
[17:10] self-focused trying to get everything
[17:12] right amen but the message has come to
[17:15] open it up to show us amen this is about
[17:17] more than just you having good conduct
[17:20] amen god is using you for redemption for
[17:23] a plan of redemption for something so
[17:25] much greater than you could ever realize
[17:29] and when we preach these things we're
[17:31] not we're not preaching these things so
[17:33] that we can be elevated and inflated as
[17:36] human beings and be proud and have our
[17:38] chest stuck down no really what we're
[17:41] preaching these things for is to awaken
[17:42] us to stop small thinking to stop carnal
[17:45] thinking to wake up so we can give our
[17:47] lives completely to this word because
[17:49] it's about so much more than we thought
[17:51] it was
[17:53] i mean it's probably so much more than
[17:55] we think it is now
[17:58] if we could really see the plan and we
[18:00] could really even see beyond the
[18:02] carnality and have a perfect heavenly
[18:05] vision it's so much bigger than we would
[18:07] realize amen it would it would not just
[18:09] require our devotion as if we have to
[18:12] give it out of a law or out of an
[18:14] obligation but it would be such a vision
[18:16] that it would demand our our complete
[18:19] consecration by the magnitude of the
[18:22] vision would give us such a heart to say
[18:24] this is the only thing i want to live
[18:26] for
[18:27] it's so perfect it's so beautiful it's
[18:29] so beyond anything i could imagine
[18:31] there's nothing else i want to live for
[18:33] this is the only thing i want to live
[18:35] for
[18:36] that's what the message has come and
[18:37] done in this age is it as it opens the
[18:40] bible it opens us away from moves us
[18:43] away from denominational thinking small
[18:45] thinking carnal thinking and brings us
[18:47] into a greater vision of a plan god had
[18:50] before the foundation of the world and
[18:52] god correcting something that first went
[18:54] wrong in heaven
[18:57] and our understanding goes so far beyond
[19:00] amen waking up in the morning and
[19:01] hitting the alarm clock amen and driving
[19:03] down the road amen that's all part of
[19:05] this greater vision but if we don't have
[19:08] the greater vision we start to lose
[19:10] purpose and hitting the alarm clock
[19:12] getting dressed and driving down the
[19:13] road
[19:16] and so the magnitude of the plan of god
[19:19] requires our absolute devotion
[19:24] not because we have to
[19:27] because we're absolutely in awe at what
[19:30] god is doing
[19:34] and it and it draws from us
[19:37] a devotion a consecration
[19:40] a laying down of our own will in our own
[19:42] lives and our own ideas
[19:44] because when you see his plan it's so
[19:46] much better than our plan
[19:49] and his thinking so much higher than our
[19:51] thinking
[19:52] that when we begin to tap into god's
[19:55] thinking and brings us out of our
[19:56] thinking amen then all of a sudden we
[19:59] don't want our thinking anymore because
[20:00] my thinking would have been wrong a
[20:02] thousand times over
[20:05] but god's thinking is perfect and so now
[20:07] we look that we look at this and we
[20:09] realize
[20:10] that that i am here
[20:13] as a chosen vessel of god
[20:16] i am a place a house for the word of god
[20:21] and the word of god is moved by the
[20:23] spirit of god and it's living through
[20:25] this vessel amen and it's far beyond my
[20:28] even my own human consciousness my own
[20:31] ability of self-awareness it's even way
[20:33] beyond that
[20:36] and and now
[20:37] i i have a
[20:39] i have a a
[20:41] a responsibility
[20:43] because not just my responsibilities his
[20:44] responsibility but my responsibility to
[20:47] yield into his hand amen and submit
[20:49] myself to him so that he can take the
[20:51] preeminence because i see there's a plan
[20:53] that's so powerful there's such a
[20:55] magnitude in this plan that if i do this
[20:57] myself i will ruin it amen i will mess
[21:00] up this perfect plan that god has so the
[21:03] only option i have is to forget my own
[21:06] thinking in my own ways and my own ideas
[21:08] and i've got to surrender it to him so
[21:10] that he'll take preeminence because
[21:12] that's the only way i'm going to keep
[21:13] from ruining what he's trying to do i
[21:16] cannot do it with my thinking my
[21:17] intelligence my willpower my my this and
[21:20] my that it will never make it friends
[21:23] it's never good enough but the plan is
[21:25] so much bigger it's not just i want to
[21:27] go to church i want to believe jesus i
[21:29] want to raise my family right and i want
[21:30] to do those things that's the same
[21:32] understanding that a denominational
[21:34] believer has and there's nothing wrong
[21:35] with that that's not wrong but it's not
[21:37] big enough
[21:41] because under that small thinking we
[21:43] make decisions and choices based off
[21:46] this small bubble that we're trying to
[21:48] preserve you know be a good christian go
[21:50] to church support the church raise my
[21:52] family to love god and because of that
[21:54] if i can still make choices and do
[21:56] things that don't interrupt that i still
[21:58] feel good about myself
[22:01] i still feel like i'm doing right i'm
[22:02] doing good because my vision is so
[22:04] narrow that i'm just trying to
[22:06] accomplish this in my life and i don't
[22:08] realize god is trying to accomplish 10
[22:10] times a thousand times more than i ever
[22:13] realized and he needs more than this
[22:15] much of devotion amen he needs a life
[22:17] that's completely surrendered and said
[22:19] god i don't know where to go i don't
[22:21] know what to say i don't know where to
[22:22] walk i don't know what to do it's so
[22:24] perfect it's so beautiful amen i don't
[22:27] want to make the wrong step
[22:31] i don't want to rake the wrong move god
[22:32] i'm in your hands
[22:35] use me lord
[22:38] because when god forced all you
[22:41] he forced all you before the foundation
[22:43] of the world he he knew the real you
[22:46] that's down on the inside that portion
[22:48] of the word that he's allotted to come
[22:49] forth in this day
[22:51] and he knew that portion of the word
[22:53] amen wouldn't be the portion that would
[22:55] hammer on an ark
[22:57] wouldn't be the portion that would march
[22:59] out of egypt
[23:01] wouldn't be the portion that would be a
[23:02] mighty man united
[23:04] to david before he comes into his
[23:06] kingdom
[23:07] you wouldn't even be the portion that
[23:09] that would sit and listen to the
[23:10] teaching of jesus by the sea of galilee
[23:13] but that portion of the word that
[23:14] portion of the life of god that's inside
[23:16] of you would be the portion that would
[23:18] come into a vessel that would have its
[23:20] heart turned back amen to the faith of
[23:23] the fathers to prevent god from smiting
[23:25] the earth with a curse
[23:29] just as important as noah building the
[23:31] ark just as important as moses leading
[23:33] them out just as important as those who
[23:36] were the disciples of jesus and followed
[23:38] him through through galilee and nazareth
[23:40] and into judea
[23:42] the role is just as important
[23:44] scripturally
[23:48] and when we look through the bible how
[23:50] many of you are thankful that noah was
[23:52] faithful
[23:55] how many are faithful that moses are
[23:57] thankful that moses was faithful amen
[23:59] that the disciples were faithful that
[24:01] paul was faithful amen we we are so
[24:03] thankful that god interrupted paul and
[24:06] paul surrendered everything and became a
[24:08] prisoner to jesus christ because i read
[24:11] amen 14 books of the bible that i
[24:13] wouldn't have if paul hadn't surrendered
[24:14] himself completely to the hand of jesus
[24:16] christ i'm so thankful that he was a
[24:19] prisoner i'm so thankful he wasn't a
[24:21] part-time believer
[24:24] i wasn't i'm so thankful he wasn't
[24:26] trying to keep his business going and
[24:28] start another tent shop and then put
[24:30] somebody over that and
[24:32] build a tent building empire
[24:36] i'm so thankful he surrendered
[24:38] everything
[24:39] because i'm here today with the
[24:41] revelation we have today with the word
[24:43] because paul was who paul was and paul
[24:45] gave it all
[24:47] we're here because moses gave all amen
[24:49] we're here because noah gave all we're
[24:51] here because david gave all
[24:54] and god has not called us the partial
[24:56] god has called us to give it all
[25:00] we're prophesied
[25:02] to
[25:04] let's go back and look at genesis
[25:06] chapter 6.
[25:18] you know before we read i just want to
[25:21] think about this
[25:23] the earth
[25:25] groaning
[25:28] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[25:31] the earth
[25:33] wanting to come back into its right
[25:35] position the earth
[25:37] still
[25:38] coming back under redemption
[25:42] brother branham tells us something
[25:44] interesting
[25:46] when he goes to calvary and when we see
[25:48] calvary at calvary when jesus was dying
[25:51] on the cross was there was a disruption
[25:52] of nature
[25:54] the the sun was blackened out amen it
[25:57] was dark and amen the then when jesus
[26:00] died there was a a great earthquake and
[26:03] and so much so that the the temple veil
[26:05] went from top to bottom brother venom
[26:07] said it was a total disruption of nature
[26:10] but but when we look at that we look at
[26:12] you know the the blackening of the sky
[26:14] the darkening of the sky in the middle
[26:16] of the day we look at the earthquake and
[26:18] all of these fearful terrible things but
[26:21] in one place when brother venom
[26:22] describes this he says amen when the son
[26:26] amen saw him on calvary it hid its face
[26:29] behind its hands and wept for joy
[26:33] and that's how brother brahma describes
[26:34] the blacking out of the sun amen he hid
[26:37] his face behind his hands and wept for
[26:39] joy and the earthquake he describes as
[26:42] the rams skipping from hill to hill the
[26:45] mountains were leaping like ram skipping
[26:48] what were they they were so happy amen
[26:50] that there was a price being paid for
[26:53] its redemption the blood was spilling on
[26:55] the ground to redeem the earth to bring
[26:57] it back into its position and look how
[26:59] the earth was responding to redemption
[27:03] it was happy amen the bible talks about
[27:06] that great day when the hills will skip
[27:09] for joy and skip like rams what are they
[27:12] talking about the hill skipping like
[27:13] rams earthquakes
[27:16] what are earthquakes earthquakes are the
[27:19] rejoicing of the earth coming into
[27:21] redemption
[27:24] are earthquakes on the increase
[27:28] is the earth rejoicing that there are
[27:30] those whose hearts have been turned back
[27:32] amen to prevent a curse from coming and
[27:35] smiting it now it's waiting for the
[27:37] purging amen and the millennial reign
[27:39] and jesus christ to set his throne upon
[27:40] the earth you think the earth is not
[27:42] going to enjoy that the earth is going
[27:44] to enjoy it friends
[27:47] just like we're going to enjoy it
[27:50] so god
[27:51] has a plan of redemption
[27:53] and he's using vessels upon the earth
[27:56] if we look here at genesis chapter 6.
[28:03] i'm going to start at verse 1.
[28:06] and it came to pass when men began to
[28:08] multiply on the face of the earth and
[28:10] daughters were born unto them that the
[28:12] sons of god saw the daughters of men
[28:14] that they were fair and they took them
[28:15] wives of all which they chose
[28:18] and the lord said my spirit shall not
[28:20] always strive with man for he also is
[28:22] flesh yet his day shall be a hundred and
[28:24] twenty years
[28:25] there were giants in the earth in those
[28:27] days and also after that when the sons
[28:29] of god came in unto the daughters of men
[28:31] and they bear children to them and the
[28:33] same became mighty men which were which
[28:36] were of old
[28:37] men of renown
[28:39] and god saw the wickedness of man was
[28:41] great on the earth and that every
[28:43] imagination of the thoughts of his heart
[28:45] was only evil continually
[28:47] and he repented the lord that he had
[28:49] made man on the earth and it grieved him
[28:51] at his heart and the lord said i will
[28:54] destroy man whom i have created from the
[28:56] face of the earth both man and beast and
[28:57] the creeping thing and the fowls of the
[28:59] air for it repenteth me that i have made
[29:02] them
[29:02] so god looking down at a man who had
[29:05] become vile and corrupt and a fallen
[29:08] nature that had fallen under this
[29:10] headship of a man that had fallen and he
[29:12] looks in it and he repent they repenteth
[29:15] himself that he had made it earth and
[29:17] man and all that was on it he was going
[29:18] to completely destroy it and wipe it off
[29:22] so there was a going to be a curse come
[29:24] upon the earth
[29:26] he was going to destroy everything
[29:29] but verse 8 says
[29:31] but noah
[29:33] but noah he was going to destroy
[29:36] everything that creepeth everything that
[29:38] moveth and all man
[29:40] but noah found grace in the eyes of the
[29:44] lord
[29:46] i love this butt
[29:48] everything was going to be destroyed man
[29:50] and all the creation upon the face of
[29:52] the earth was going to be destroyed but
[29:55] but there was a vessel of the word that
[29:58] he could use for redemption and
[29:59] salvation in that day but noah was a
[30:02] vessel under grace and noah found grace
[30:06] in the eyes of the lord
[30:10] so we know the story well god now tells
[30:13] noah a plan of salvation for his day
[30:16] amen and a plan to save even the
[30:18] creation upon the earth and he was to
[30:20] take amen two of every clean beast the
[30:22] male and the female and seven are a two
[30:24] of unclean seven of clean and he was
[30:26] supposed to hide them away in the ark
[30:27] and build the ark and do all that he did
[30:29] and and noah was building when he was
[30:32] building on that ark amen he was working
[30:34] in obedience to the word of god and this
[30:37] vessel of the word received the word
[30:40] amen was creating a way of escape he was
[30:42] creating a redemption he was creating
[30:45] amen a salvation
[30:48] and he worked and he worked and he
[30:49] worked amen and and god brought amen two
[30:53] of of the beasts and seven of the clean
[30:55] and brought them into the ark and noah
[30:58] and his sons they come into the ark as
[31:00] well and so noah
[31:02] if you think of it this way noah had a
[31:04] message of destruction
[31:07] noah had a message of imminent doom and
[31:10] destruction amen but noah also had a
[31:13] message of salvation and escaped from
[31:16] destruction it wasn't a one-sided
[31:19] message amen noah was telling them that
[31:22] it would rain the prophet of god goes in
[31:23] great detail amen and they had
[31:25] scientific instruments they could
[31:27] measure there's no moisture there
[31:28] there's no rain we've never had rain
[31:29] before they didn't believe him and noah
[31:32] was was speaking of an imminent doom
[31:34] amen but god because he had a vessel
[31:37] amen under grace in that day he had a
[31:40] vessel that could create a way of escape
[31:43] he had a vessel who in the face of
[31:45] destruction could be preaching a way of
[31:47] salvation
[31:50] and we know it wasn't just noah that was
[31:52] saved but the creation the creatures
[31:55] that god had made were now saved upon
[31:57] the ark and after the ark i'd landed
[32:00] back on mount air right in the and the
[32:01] the land had dried off amen the animals
[32:04] dispersed again and filled the earth
[32:06] again with the creation that god had
[32:08] created
[32:10] with the animals that god had made he
[32:12] had preserved them and they would not
[32:14] have been preserved if noah had not
[32:16] found grace in the eyes of the lord
[32:19] what god had spoken to existence the
[32:21] spoken word of god the animals and the
[32:23] creation it would have been absolutely
[32:25] wiped off and destroyed if there not had
[32:27] been a vessel of god on the earth that
[32:29] could open a door of salvation
[32:32] and what was the door of salvation amen
[32:35] the message of destruction
[32:38] also carried with it a door of salvation
[32:43] this is so good
[32:45] let's go to genesis chapter 7.
[32:50] verse 23
[32:52] and every living substance was destroyed
[32:54] which was upon the face of the ground
[32:56] both man and cattle and the creeping
[32:58] things and the fowl of the heaven and
[33:00] they were destroyed from the earth
[33:02] they were destroyed from the earth and
[33:04] noah only remained alive and they that
[33:07] were with him
[33:09] in the ark
[33:11] everything was destroyed except this
[33:14] vessel
[33:15] and all that were with him
[33:17] in the ark
[33:22] so noah
[33:24] if we could look at it this way
[33:27] noah
[33:29] was a vessel
[33:32] of god a vessel of the word
[33:34] for salvation
[33:38] noah's message he was preaching
[33:41] the message he preached was judgment and
[33:44] destruction
[33:47] but with him
[33:49] was salvation
[33:52] those that were with him in the ark were
[33:54] all saved
[33:57] and we know later we would find
[33:59] that even even one that was with him
[34:01] would end up having a cursed line and
[34:04] ham would would end up under a curse but
[34:07] he was with him in the ark and he was
[34:09] saved
[34:11] so
[34:12] noah
[34:14] with a message of destruction
[34:18] with him when he
[34:20] he was manifesting the word when he
[34:22] would saw down a board and nail it on
[34:25] what was he doing he was living the word
[34:26] he was manifesting the word for his day
[34:29] and under the manifestation of the word
[34:31] for his day there was an opportunity at
[34:33] salvation
[34:35] and everything was destroyed except
[34:36] those that were with noah
[34:39] in the ark
[34:41] let's go to john
[34:42] chapter 3.
[34:52] john chapter 3
[34:54] verse 12.
[35:02] if i have told you earthly things and
[35:04] you believe not
[35:05] how shall you believe if i tell you of
[35:07] heavenly things
[35:08] and no man hath ascended up to heaven
[35:10] but he that come down from heaven even
[35:12] the son of man which is in heaven
[35:15] and as moses lifted up the serpent in
[35:16] the wilderness even so must the son of
[35:18] man be lifted up that whosoever
[35:20] believeth in him shall not perish but of
[35:22] eternal life for god so loved the world
[35:24] that he gave his only begotten son that
[35:26] whosoever believeth in him should not
[35:29] perish but have everlasting life for god
[35:32] sent not his son into the world to
[35:34] condemn the world but that the world
[35:36] through him might be saved
[35:38] he that believeth on him is con not
[35:40] condemned but he that believeth not is
[35:42] condemned already because he hath not
[35:44] believed in the name of the only
[35:46] begotten son of god and this is the
[35:48] condemnation that light has come into
[35:50] the world and men loved darkness rather
[35:52] than light because their deeds were evil
[35:55] so now we find out this is a very
[35:57] familiar passage of scripture people
[35:59] quote this all the time but you realize
[36:02] verse 17 for god sent not a son into the
[36:04] world to condemn the world but that the
[36:06] world through him might be saved
[36:09] jesus was not sent for condemnation he
[36:12] was sent for salvation
[36:15] noah was not sent
[36:18] for condemnation
[36:21] because god had already condemned the
[36:23] earth before he called noah
[36:28] noah was not sent for condemnation
[36:31] and judgment god had already passed
[36:33] judgment before he called no into his
[36:34] ministry
[36:36] noah's ministry was to open a way of
[36:38] escape
[36:40] and when that was rejected darkness was
[36:42] turned away or light was refused there
[36:45] was only the path of darkness death had
[36:47] to come but they were already under a
[36:49] curse of death
[36:51] noah didn't condemn them to death when
[36:53] they refused to walk in the light they
[36:55] remained in death they remained in
[36:56] judgment
[36:58] so jesus christ did not come to condemn
[37:01] the earth the earth was already
[37:03] condemned
[37:05] so his message was not a message of
[37:07] condemnation he was here for salvation
[37:10] and in that salvation was warning that
[37:12] the earth is condemned amen everything
[37:14] is condemned everything is rotten but
[37:16] that was the condition it was already in
[37:20] already bound for judgment already
[37:22] doomed already under a curse already
[37:25] bound to fail amen so when they refused
[37:27] the prince of life they refused light
[37:29] they refused life amen there was nothing
[37:31] left but to remain in darkness and to
[37:33] remain in death
[37:35] so they refused jesus christ amen and 70
[37:38] or a few years later in 70 a.d titus
[37:40] marches in and destroys all of jerusalem
[37:43] hey listen jerusalem was bound for
[37:44] destruction anyways
[37:47] it was already condemned amen they were
[37:50] under a curse before christ showed up
[37:52] they just kept themself under a curse
[37:54] and heaped more destruction upon
[37:56] themselves
[37:58] by rejecting the prince of life
[38:01] noah come on the scene after god had
[38:04] already judged the earth and condemned
[38:06] the earth now noah is only telling the
[38:09] people warning them of what god has
[38:11] already declared he is only telling them
[38:13] what what the condition already is
[38:16] they're already under judgment they're
[38:17] already bound for destruction amen god
[38:19] is already finished with this world amen
[38:22] but god has made a way if you can come
[38:25] this way there is a way of salvation a
[38:28] way of escape amen
[38:30] and knowing his sons and his son's wife
[38:32] and his son's wife they found a way to
[38:33] escape but so did a bird and a lizard
[38:36] amen and a deer and an elephant and a
[38:38] whatever also found a way of escape
[38:42] it wasn't just the elect predestinated
[38:44] seed but it was anybody anything else
[38:47] that could get in that ark
[38:51] because noah was there a bird was saved
[38:55] i know that sounds silly but i just want
[38:57] you to catch a bigger picture
[39:00] if noah had not been there
[39:03] and found grace in the eyes of god that
[39:05] bird would have never survived those
[39:07] sheep would have never survived that
[39:08] that whatever creature that was in that
[39:10] ark would have never survived amen and
[39:12] there would have been a mass extinction
[39:14] and they would have not what god had
[39:15] created for pleasure would have been
[39:17] wiped off the earth
[39:19] but because there was one that could
[39:21] come on the scene because he found grace
[39:23] in the eyes of god a chosen vessel for
[39:26] that day he had a message of life
[39:32] but it may have sounded to many like a
[39:34] message of death
[39:37] the perception of those that were living
[39:40] the life they wanted to live upon the
[39:42] earth were happy with the way things
[39:44] were and their wickedness and the
[39:45] imagination of their heart
[39:47] continually they looked at noah and noah
[39:51] had a message amen and his message was
[39:54] rough and his message was condemning and
[39:57] his message was exclusive
[40:01] think of all the terms that you can use
[40:03] noah was believing his way was the only
[40:05] way
[40:07] it was
[40:08] narrow-minded it was exclusive
[40:12] it was it was i mean it was
[40:15] self-elevating
[40:19] noah said you know
[40:20] god told me and the only way to be saved
[40:23] is to get on this boat that he told me
[40:24] to build
[40:28] really noah
[40:29] [Music]
[40:31] it was
[40:32] seemingly self-elevating
[40:34] seemingly
[40:36] condemning and saying you know god is
[40:39] going to judge you there's going to be a
[40:40] flood god's not happy with this world
[40:42] and there were people there who were
[40:44] happy
[40:46] there were people that are satisfied
[40:47] with their life there were people there
[40:49] who were enjoying amen having the
[40:51] imaginations of their heart fulfilled
[40:53] all the time even though it was evil
[40:55] they were satisfied so noah's message
[40:57] sounded condemning sounded harsh sounded
[41:00] exclusive sounded narrow-minded sounded
[41:03] self-uh
[41:04] self-inflated
[41:07] but it was the truth and the only way of
[41:09] salvation
[41:11] it it was and it was god through a
[41:13] vessel of grace preaching grace
[41:15] preaching mercy amen but because it was
[41:18] so different amen than what they viewed
[41:20] they viewed it as evil when it was good
[41:25] that's the same way they viewed jesus
[41:26] christ his ministry was viewed by the
[41:28] religious leaders as evil as wicked as
[41:32] condemning as harmful
[41:35] [Music]
[41:36] he was condemning the religion of the
[41:38] day amen and they felt like when he came
[41:40] against the religion of the day that he
[41:42] was coming against the law of moses and
[41:44] he in no way was coming against the law
[41:46] of moses he was showing them that
[41:47] they're cursed under the law of moses
[41:50] that the very law that they believed was
[41:52] the very law that had cursed them and
[41:54] condemned them and now there was a way
[41:55] of escape upon the earth amen there was
[41:57] a vessel of the word there to open a
[42:00] door amen and they didn't want to go
[42:01] through that door they were happy in the
[42:03] life they had
[42:05] so the message of jesus christ sounded
[42:07] to many like it was narrow exclusive
[42:12] he said i am the bread that come down
[42:13] from god out of heaven
[42:18] amen
[42:19] unless you come to me
[42:22] i mean just think of how this sounded in
[42:25] the day that he was preaching the
[42:27] message
[42:29] it sounded harsh critical condemning
[42:34] when he would say such harsh things
[42:37] about ministries
[42:40] harsh things about high priest and chief
[42:43] elders and teachers of the words
[42:52] it didn't sound like
[42:54] mercy
[42:57] but jesus was not sent into the world to
[42:59] condemn the world
[43:03] that was not the purpose god sent him
[43:06] that was not the purpose god called noah
[43:09] god called noah to make a way of escape
[43:12] because it was already condemned
[43:14] god brought jesus christ to make a way
[43:16] of escape because the world was already
[43:18] condemned
[43:21] friends you and i are here with the same
[43:22] kind of message
[43:25] the same kind of message because there's
[43:27] an arc of safety in this day and it's
[43:29] the message of the hour
[43:32] but to many it sounds exclusive
[43:34] narrow-minded self-elevating
[43:40] it's no different than the rest of the
[43:41] bible amen and in this i'm preaching
[43:44] this for me not for you but but because
[43:46] every once in a while i need god to
[43:48] redial the dials and get my thinking
[43:50] back and my attitude right in the right
[43:52] spot because the bride is not here to
[43:54] condemn the world
[43:57] because we have the same ministry we he
[43:59] had amen it's a continuation of the same
[44:01] thing amen and he was not sent to
[44:03] condemn the world but that through him
[44:05] the world might be saved noah was not
[44:07] sent to condemn the world but that
[44:09] through him the world might be saved
[44:10] amen the bride is not here to condemn
[44:13] the whole world the bride is here to say
[44:15] there is an ark and there is a door
[44:17] there's an open door if you can go
[44:18] through it you can escape the
[44:20] condemnation that's upon the earth
[44:24] but sometimes because of rejection amen
[44:27] and because of harsh words and because
[44:29] of circumstances amen we start to take
[44:31] the attitude that the bride is here for
[44:33] judgment the bride is not here for
[44:35] judgment but those who refuse the
[44:37] message will be judged
[44:39] there is a judgment but really friends
[44:42] they're already judged
[44:46] the the denominations are already judged
[44:50] we're not here to judge them they've
[44:52] been judged
[44:54] we're not here to condemn them they've
[44:55] been condemned
[44:58] now that doesn't mean moses doesn't say
[45:00] because of your wickedness destruction
[45:01] has come he's just saying what's already
[45:04] going on
[45:08] he's not saying if you don't listen to
[45:10] me
[45:12] then god will curse this earth and
[45:14] you'll die no you're already cursed to
[45:17] die
[45:20] but there's a way of escape
[45:24] that's why
[45:26] the bride's message is a message of life
[45:30] the blessed message of safety
[45:32] it's a message of mercy
[45:35] it is a vessel of grace
[45:37] that is here to extend mercy to those
[45:40] who can receive it
[45:42] will there be those who are condemned
[45:44] because they refuse it absolutely
[45:47] but that's not the point
[45:50] that's only the effect for those who
[45:52] won't receive it but that's not the
[45:53] point
[45:55] the point is so that she can be here a
[45:58] voice a continuation of the ministry
[46:00] that we've had in this end time to say
[46:02] come out from among her
[46:04] come come and drink of the water of life
[46:07] freely amen come the spirit and the
[46:09] bride are saying come
[46:12] there's an opportunity to drink of this
[46:14] water of life she's saying come to the
[46:16] fountain come to the life come to the
[46:18] word come to the light come
[46:21] come and be saved come and be free come
[46:24] and drink of the word come and receive
[46:27] the light come and walk in the light
[46:29] come
[46:31] that's the message of the bride
[46:34] and i think sometimes when we when we
[46:36] get beat down a little bit knocked
[46:38] around once in a while amen we tend to
[46:40] take the side of
[46:42] of condemnation and destruction and and
[46:44] this and this and this and this and
[46:46] forget listen as far as we know there's
[46:49] still an open door here
[46:52] god hasn't told us otherwise as far as
[46:54] we know there's a as an open door
[46:55] there's an opportunity and noah stood in
[46:59] the door and preached amen he was
[47:01] standing in the gap he was standing in
[47:03] the breach amen this door was the
[47:05] separation between life and death and he
[47:08] stood in the breach he stood in the gap
[47:11] and he called people to come into the
[47:13] ark come come to the word come to
[47:16] salvation come to your safety
[47:20] he didn't stand in the door and say
[47:22] you're going to die amen because you
[47:24] didn't listen to me
[47:30] and that would have been true
[47:33] that was true
[47:35] but they were already dead
[47:40] he came to offer life
[47:45] the truth is
[47:46] if the message is refused in this day
[47:48] there's nothing left but death and
[47:50] destruction
[47:52] if the message is turned down amen it's
[47:55] the way of escape in this hour it's the
[47:57] word of god this message is christ it is
[48:00] the ark
[48:03] that's the truth
[48:04] and to refuse that is to refuse life and
[48:06] to stay in darkness that's absolutely
[48:08] the truth
[48:10] but if we don't remember
[48:12] that we're here for life
[48:14] where it's a message of life if we don't
[48:17] remember that we can take the wrong
[48:18] attitude
[48:20] and i don't want to take the wrong
[48:22] attitude
[48:24] let's go to genesis chapter 50.
[48:40] genesis chapter 50 verse 19.
[48:44] we're at the end of the story of joseph
[48:46] and we know the story quite well joseph
[48:48] and his brethrens were the they were the
[48:51] 12 sons
[48:52] of their father jacob who was israel
[48:55] and joseph was a beloved son
[48:58] he was a favorite of his dad and he was
[49:00] also very gifted he could see visions
[49:02] and dreams and god spoke to him and he
[49:04] prophesied and in his prophecy he
[49:06] prophesied about god raising him up over
[49:08] his brethren and that their sheaves
[49:10] would all bow to him and even the sun
[49:12] and the moon his mother and father would
[49:14] bow to him and the family didn't like
[49:16] this dream because it looked like he was
[49:18] elevating himself
[49:22] it looked like he was elevating himself
[49:24] it looked like that
[49:26] you were all going to have to come and
[49:28] bow to me
[49:30] is that right
[49:32] but
[49:33] but we know that in order for that
[49:36] vision to come to pass that dream that
[49:38] he had to come to pass that he was going
[49:40] to have to go through certain obstacles
[49:42] and certain difficulties he was going to
[49:44] have to be hated by his brethren sold
[49:46] into bondage into slavery sent down into
[49:48] egypt as a slave sold them to potiphar's
[49:50] house then aft in potiphar's house he
[49:52] would see a reprieve amen from his
[49:54] situation but then that would go away
[49:56] under the the advances of potiphar's
[49:59] wife and now there was a lie told on him
[50:01] and he was sent down in the prison and
[50:02] he would labor in prison for many years
[50:04] and and finally through a set of
[50:06] circumstances god would bring him up
[50:08] into the presence of pharaoh so that he
[50:09] could interpret a dream for pharaoh and
[50:11] from there he would he sat in pharaoh's
[50:13] right hand and he would begin to rule
[50:14] over all of egypt and he was sent down
[50:17] to egypt amen and he suffered he
[50:20] suffered rejection he suffered abuse he
[50:23] suffered all kinds of things that he
[50:24] suffered amen lies
[50:27] false accusations he suffered all all
[50:30] this stuff because he was going to be a
[50:33] vessel amen a vessel of god for life for
[50:37] salvation
[50:41] and in verse
[50:42] chapter 50 verse 19 it says and joseph
[50:44] said unto them fear not for
[50:47] am i in the place of god but as for you
[50:50] you thought evil against me but god
[50:52] meant it unto good to bring to pass is
[50:54] at this day to save much people alive
[51:00] joseph said you know this is the
[51:02] fulfillment of the vision amen that
[51:04] they've come down and now they bow
[51:06] because he's been exalted he's been
[51:07] placed in a position but that position
[51:10] he's been placed in was not to have his
[51:12] brother's bow to him and not to have the
[51:14] sun and moon his parents bowed to him
[51:16] because he's exalted he was exalted into
[51:18] that position so that he could save
[51:20] their lives
[51:22] and not just their lives but he saved
[51:25] much people
[51:26] i mean there was much salvation amen not
[51:29] just for the chosen tribe
[51:31] men of israel not just for the 12 sons
[51:33] and their children they were saved but
[51:35] there was also egyptians saved and other
[51:37] nations say there was much people saved
[51:40] because joseph was brought into position
[51:43] and so joseph's message amen to them it
[51:46] sounded exclusive amen it sounded uh uh
[51:50] self-inflated it sounded however it
[51:52] sounded amen and even the working out of
[51:55] the details probably didn't go according
[51:57] to the way that joseph thought it would
[51:59] happen he didn't realize the rejection
[52:01] and the and then be brought out of
[52:02] prison and all of the things that would
[52:04] happen to him he probably didn't fully
[52:06] realize what was going to happen but he
[52:08] found himself exactly where god said he
[52:11] would be and he was not there for
[52:12] condemnation he was there for life
[52:19] and those who refused to go to jose
[52:21] joseph they would die
[52:23] because he had all the grain if they
[52:25] didn't listen to joseph
[52:27] when joseph gave the interpretation of
[52:28] the dream he said there's going to be
[52:29] seven good years seven years of famine
[52:32] now we need to store up and pharaoh
[52:34] could recognize amen that this was a
[52:36] vessel he needed to listen to and when
[52:38] he listened and subjected himself and
[52:40] all of egypt under joseph joseph had the
[52:43] word of life for that day and when they
[52:45] listened to joseph amen not just the the
[52:48] nation of israel was saved but much
[52:51] people were saved because they listened
[52:53] to joseph
[52:54] they respected joseph they honored
[52:56] joseph they obeyed joseph and under
[52:58] joseph's ministry
[53:00] much people were saved
[53:03] [Music]
[53:04] you meant it for evil god meant it for
[53:06] good
[53:08] been rejected
[53:10] been lied about
[53:11] been falsely accused been all of these
[53:14] things but at the end of the day joseph
[53:16] had a bigger vision than his narrow
[53:18] tunnel vision
[53:20] he had a broader vision that could say
[53:22] i'm in the place of god
[53:25] have any of you been rejected
[53:28] falsely accused for what you believe and
[53:30] what you stand for have you been accused
[53:33] of being self-elevated
[53:36] of being narrow-minded
[53:39] of all of these things if you've been
[53:41] accused of those things amen then then
[53:44] just just realize no matter what happens
[53:46] amen you're in the place of god and that
[53:49] place that god has placed you though it
[53:51] causes rejection and though it causes
[53:53] all kinds of misunderstandings that
[53:55] place is for salvation for many
[53:59] and we have to recognize that so we
[54:01] don't become bitter so that we don't
[54:03] become angry when you look at joseph
[54:05] there's no bitterness in joseph there's
[54:07] no anger in joseph all there is is love
[54:10] for anybody that will come to him to
[54:11] receive the provision
[54:14] there's mercy that's being extended amen
[54:17] he doesn't he doesn't even get after the
[54:20] reuben who was so mean towards him he
[54:22] doesn't say anything about him he's so
[54:24] happy that the one who hated me now will
[54:27] come to me and i can give him life
[54:29] because he's come to me
[54:31] [Music]
[54:37] amen i wonder
[54:38] oh my
[54:39] [Music]
[54:42] i wonder if sometimes
[54:44] we would have somebody who so evilly
[54:46] spoke against us and so abused us and so
[54:48] misused us amen and said such horrible
[54:51] things about what we believe i wonder if
[54:53] god would finally get a hold of their
[54:54] heart amen and they would start
[54:55] believing the message if we'd be happy
[54:57] or sad about that
[54:58] [Applause]
[55:02] [Laughter]
[55:04] when we begin to wash their feet and hug
[55:06] them and take communion side by side and
[55:08] they said such horrible things about you
[55:10] and caused you to weep in your bed at
[55:11] night and say things that grieved you to
[55:13] your heart amen and now they want to
[55:15] they want to believe and come to the
[55:16] church well that's exactly what the
[55:18] first church had to deal with when the
[55:19] apostle paul was converted amen because
[55:22] some of them had relatives slew by him
[55:24] some of them had relatives imprisoned by
[55:26] him some of them may have had paul come
[55:28] into their house and take their dad out
[55:30] of the house and drag him off to prison
[55:32] and beat him there's the church had to
[55:34] live with that reality amen but paul
[55:37] amen was a chosen vessel of god and in
[55:39] due season god got a hold of paul and
[55:41] paul came to the truth he came to the
[55:43] light amen and there had to be people
[55:45] who had to accept that and love paul
[55:50] because this isn't a message of
[55:52] condemnation it's the message of life
[55:54] come and drink of the fountain
[55:57] the spirit and the bright say come
[56:02] anybody that's thirsty says come
[56:04] but you can't say come and when somebody
[56:06] comes say no i don't think this is for
[56:08] you
[56:10] you said too many horrible things
[56:12] you blaspheme
[56:13] the apostle paul said i blasphemed
[56:16] in the scripture
[56:18] he said but i did it ignorantly
[56:21] well to me blaspheme will be blaspheming
[56:25] and he should be cut out forever
[56:27] but you can't cut out a predestinated
[56:29] seat of god
[56:32] i don't know what pass he got but he got
[56:35] a pass
[56:37] and i'm thankful he got a pass and the
[56:40] challenge for that first church was to
[56:42] accept paul
[56:44] that was a challenge to the first church
[56:46] amen because when even when god told
[56:49] ananias to go and lay hands on pray for
[56:50] him he said god i know this man
[56:52] and he's done all kinds of horrible
[56:54] things you don't want me to go there and
[56:55] pray for him you're kidding me
[57:00] and god sent him anyways amen and when
[57:02] he walked in he said brother saul
[57:06] oh praise god he had to get over himself
[57:09] and realize that i'm in the place of god
[57:11] amen i'm in the place of god and i'm in
[57:13] the place of god just for much salvation
[57:16] for much life i'm not here for judgment
[57:19] if i wasn't here the earth would already
[57:21] be under a curse so i'm here to prevent
[57:23] that
[57:26] amen listen if if if malachi 4 had not
[57:30] come
[57:34] where would we be
[57:37] so we look at we look at the ministry of
[57:39] malachi 4
[57:41] and the rejection of that
[57:43] is a horrible thing
[57:47] but if malachi hadn't come
[57:50] the word was already rejected it was
[57:52] already a horrible thing
[57:55] it's just more of the same
[57:57] more judgment more condemnation more set
[58:00] up for destruction
[58:02] so malachi 4 did not come to bring
[58:05] destruction he came to prevent the curse
[58:07] from smiting the earth
[58:10] and then those who hearts would be
[58:12] turned back to the fathers came to
[58:14] prevent the earth from being smitten
[58:16] with a curse so my my ministry what i'm
[58:20] here for what you're here for is for the
[58:22] prevention of destruction
[58:27] now maybe only a few can come to that
[58:30] prevention but if i'm here on this earth
[58:32] and i live 70 80 90 years and i can
[58:35] prevent one life from being destroyed
[58:37] then i'm in the place of god for life
[58:40] i'm not here for death the world is
[58:42] already under death i'm not here for
[58:44] judgment the world is already judged my
[58:47] life my existence is for life
[58:51] and i have to keep reminding myself of
[58:53] that because there's so many times amen
[58:55] we we tend to get to the negative side
[58:58] everything's evil everything's wicked
[59:00] well that's the truth
[59:03] but if you focus on that you start to
[59:05] get discouraged
[59:07] then when your brothers say things about
[59:09] you they shouldn't say you get
[59:10] discouraged
[59:13] but you're in the place of god
[59:17] for much
[59:18] life
[59:20] to save life
[59:22] much life
[59:25] i say god
[59:26] help us to stay focused
[59:29] on why we're
[59:30] here because if we weren't here with our
[59:33] hearts turned back
[59:34] he would smite the earth with a curse
[59:37] but because his seed is here and their
[59:40] hearts have been turned back and they
[59:42] believe him now the earth won't be
[59:44] smitten with a curse the earth will be
[59:45] purged and cleaned
[59:48] and restored
[59:50] oh
[59:51] i'm so thankful
[59:53] that i'm in the place of god
[59:57] that doesn't mean it's easy
[1:00:00] but it's still the truth
[1:00:02] let's go to acts chapter 13.
[1:00:22] i hope that by the end of this message i
[1:00:24] can get myself to a place
[1:00:27] to where
[1:00:29] i can look forward to talking to that
[1:00:30] person who's rejected me a thousand
[1:00:32] times
[1:00:34] thinking this might be the time
[1:00:37] because
[1:00:38] without this understanding
[1:00:40] i don't want to talk to him again
[1:00:43] i do not i don't want to come in contact
[1:00:45] i don't want to rub shoulders i don't
[1:00:47] want to go back to the family reunion i
[1:00:48] don't want to
[1:00:51] i don't want to do any of that
[1:00:53] but when you realize you're in the place
[1:00:54] of god and they may have rejected and
[1:00:56] they may have sold you out and they may
[1:00:58] have falsely accused you they may have
[1:00:59] done all of this stuff in the past amen
[1:01:01] they may have treated you like paul
[1:01:02] treated the first church they may
[1:01:04] treated you like joseph's brothers
[1:01:05] treated him but it doesn't matter amen
[1:01:08] i'm willing to go back and face it all
[1:01:10] again because i have a message of life
[1:01:12] i'm here for life
[1:01:14] and maybe just maybe
[1:01:17] god will bring a change
[1:01:20] acts chapter 13 verse 45
[1:01:23] but when the jews saw the multitude they
[1:01:25] were filled with envy and spake against
[1:01:27] those things which were spoken by paul
[1:01:29] contradicting and blaspheming
[1:01:31] then paul and barnabas waxed bold and
[1:01:33] said it was necessary that the word of
[1:01:35] god should first have been spoken to you
[1:01:37] but seeing you put it from you and judge
[1:01:38] yourselves unworthy of everlasting life
[1:01:40] lo we turn to the gentiles
[1:01:43] for so hat the lord commanded us saying
[1:01:45] i have set thee to be a light of the
[1:01:47] gentiles that thou should just be for
[1:01:49] salvation unto the ends of the earth
[1:01:52] and when the gentiles heard this they
[1:01:54] were glad and glorified the word of the
[1:01:56] lord and as many as were ordained to
[1:01:58] eternal life believed
[1:02:01] paul has a prophecy over him and that
[1:02:03] prophecy's fulfilling is out of isaiah
[1:02:06] but the prophecy is the lord commanded
[1:02:08] them saying verse 47 i have set thee to
[1:02:10] be a light of the gentiles that thou
[1:02:12] should be for salvation so what was the
[1:02:15] purpose of paul why did god call him
[1:02:18] what was his ministry
[1:02:20] he was saved for the purpose of
[1:02:22] salvation he was called for the purpose
[1:02:24] of salvation unto the ends of the earth
[1:02:27] now were there many people that were
[1:02:29] condemned because of the way they
[1:02:30] treated paul absolutely i would say it
[1:02:32] this way they were further condemned
[1:02:38] but
[1:02:39] he
[1:02:40] he was a vessel chosen of god to move
[1:02:43] into a prophecy and in that prophecy he
[1:02:45] was sent to be enlightened to the
[1:02:46] gentiles to be for salvation and to the
[1:02:49] ends of the earth so his ministry was a
[1:02:51] ministry of salvation to the ends of the
[1:02:53] earth
[1:02:55] praise god
[1:02:58] and paul ran into all kinds of trouble
[1:03:01] and all kinds of rejection and all kinds
[1:03:04] of hatred he even he even had people who
[1:03:06] reject him and lie about him and follow
[1:03:08] him around amen and
[1:03:10] propose to be apostles over him and
[1:03:12] change his doctrine he had all kinds of
[1:03:15] things happen he even had to commit
[1:03:17] people into lord and said the lord will
[1:03:18] deal with them
[1:03:21] they were they were doing all kinds of
[1:03:22] horrible things but it didn't change the
[1:03:24] fact that paul was for salvation
[1:03:28] his ministry was for salvation those who
[1:03:31] came against it were hating light they
[1:03:33] were hating life
[1:03:35] they were condemning themselves in a
[1:03:36] greater way they were heaping
[1:03:38] destruction upon themselves but that was
[1:03:40] not the purpose of paul's ministry the
[1:03:42] purpose of paul's ministry was to be for
[1:03:44] salvation to the ends of the earth
[1:03:47] and that was the purpose that he lived
[1:03:48] in and the purpose he moved in amen and
[1:03:51] in doing that many people further
[1:03:53] condemned themselves and hate
[1:03:55] destruction upon their own heads and
[1:03:57] caused all kinds of trouble for
[1:03:58] themselves but that wasn't why paul was
[1:04:00] walking the earth he was walking the
[1:04:02] earth for salvation
[1:04:06] even here when the
[1:04:07] jews refuse him and they reject him and
[1:04:10] he says now i turn from you and go to
[1:04:12] the gentiles because you know you count
[1:04:14] yourselves unworthy of everlasting life
[1:04:16] when you find over in romans paul is
[1:04:18] pleading saying my heart's desire is for
[1:04:20] my brethren to be saved
[1:04:23] he just recognized that they had
[1:04:24] rejected life and he was to move into
[1:04:26] his ministry to the gentiles but he
[1:04:28] never gave up his heart that israel
[1:04:30] would be saved he said he would even
[1:04:32] consider himself a castaway so that they
[1:04:34] might receive the truth
[1:04:36] so paul
[1:04:38] never took that attitude
[1:04:42] let's turn to jonah
[1:05:00] jonah chapter 1
[1:05:03] and we'll look at verse 1.
[1:05:09] now the word of the lord
[1:05:12] came unto jonah the son of amitay saying
[1:05:15] arise go to nineveh that great city
[1:05:18] and cry against it for their wickedness
[1:05:20] has come up before me
[1:05:22] but jonah rose up to flee into tarshish
[1:05:25] from the presence of the lord and went
[1:05:27] down to joppa and he found a ship going
[1:05:28] to tarshish so he paid the fare thereof
[1:05:30] and went down into it to go with them
[1:05:33] and to tarshish from the presence of the
[1:05:35] lord
[1:05:37] this is an interesting opening scripture
[1:05:39] because
[1:05:41] god is telling
[1:05:43] jonah to go to nineveh
[1:05:45] in a great city and cry against it
[1:05:48] for their wickedness has come up before
[1:05:50] me so he's sent down to cry against the
[1:05:53] city and he doesn't go there he runs
[1:05:55] away from the presence of the lord and
[1:05:56] he takes a ship to tarshish and we know
[1:05:59] all that happens the storm comes he's
[1:06:00] thrown into the sea swallowed by the
[1:06:02] great fish and and then he spit out
[1:06:04] again but i want to go over to chapter
[1:06:06] three and pick it up chapter three verse
[1:06:08] one
[1:06:10] this was after he spit out upon dry land
[1:06:14] and says and the word of the lord came
[1:06:15] into jonah the second time saying arise
[1:06:17] go into nineveh that great city and
[1:06:20] preach unto it the preaching that i bid
[1:06:22] thee
[1:06:23] so jonah arose and went into nineveh
[1:06:25] according to the word of the lord now
[1:06:27] nineveh was an exceeding great city of
[1:06:29] three days journey
[1:06:31] now remember
[1:06:32] god told jonah here
[1:06:35] he says preach unto it the preaching
[1:06:37] that i bid thee
[1:06:39] so there was a specific message that god
[1:06:41] gave jonah and jonah was only to speak
[1:06:44] that message
[1:06:46] all right preach unto
[1:06:48] it the preaching that i bid thee i wish
[1:06:50] i had a manuscript of that
[1:06:52] word for word
[1:06:54] so jonah arose and went unto nineveh
[1:06:56] according to the word of the lord now
[1:06:58] nineveh was an exceeding great city of
[1:07:00] three days journey and jonah began to
[1:07:03] enter into the city a day's journey and
[1:07:04] he cried and said yet forty days and
[1:07:07] nineveh shall be overthrown
[1:07:09] so the people of nineveh believed god
[1:07:11] and proclaimed a fast and put on
[1:07:13] sackcloth from the greatest of them even
[1:07:15] to the least of them
[1:07:17] for word came unto the king of nineveh
[1:07:19] and he arose from his throne and he laid
[1:07:21] his robe from him and covered him with
[1:07:22] sackcloth and satin ashes
[1:07:25] and he caused it to be proclaimed and
[1:07:27] published through nineveh by the decree
[1:07:29] of the king and his noble saying let
[1:07:31] neither man nor beast heard nor flock
[1:07:33] taste anything let them not feed nor
[1:07:36] drink water
[1:07:37] but let man and beast be covered with
[1:07:39] sackcloth and cry mightily unto god yay
[1:07:41] let them turn everyone from his evil way
[1:07:43] from the violence that is in their hands
[1:07:46] who can tell if god will turn and repent
[1:07:49] and turn away from the fierce anger that
[1:07:51] we perish not
[1:07:52] and god saw their works that they turn
[1:07:54] from their evil way and god repented of
[1:07:57] the evil that he had said that he would
[1:07:58] do unto them and he did it not
[1:08:02] chapter 4 verse 1
[1:08:04] but it displeased jonah
[1:08:08] exceedingly
[1:08:13] this whole nation
[1:08:15] repented
[1:08:17] and sacked off the masters and god
[1:08:19] spared
[1:08:20] a city so large it took three days to
[1:08:22] journey across it how many hundreds of
[1:08:25] thousands or i don't know millions or
[1:08:26] how many people were in that city i
[1:08:28] don't know but that journey across that
[1:08:30] being three days across then so so large
[1:08:34] and they were everyone saved and it
[1:08:36] displeased jonah exceedingly
[1:08:41] and he was very angry
[1:08:44] oh i love the bible
[1:08:47] and he prayed unto the lord and said i
[1:08:49] pray thee o lord was not this my saying
[1:08:51] when i was yet in my country therefore i
[1:08:53] fled before into tarshish for i knew
[1:08:56] that thou art a gracious god and
[1:08:58] merciful
[1:08:59] slow to anger of great kindness and
[1:09:02] repentancy of the evil
[1:09:06] and jonah is unhappy about this
[1:09:10] i read through this scripture and i say
[1:09:12] praise god praise god you're merciful
[1:09:14] you're slow to wrath hey amen but
[1:09:16] jonah's looking at this and say that's
[1:09:18] what i said in the beginning that's why
[1:09:20] i went to tarshish i was afraid this
[1:09:22] would happen
[1:09:27] i read that again therefore i fled
[1:09:29] before the tarsus for i knew that thou
[1:09:32] art a gracious god
[1:09:34] and merciful slow to anger and of great
[1:09:36] kindness
[1:09:37] and repentancy of the evil therefore now
[1:09:39] o lord take i beseech thee my life for
[1:09:41] me for it is better for me to die
[1:09:44] than to live
[1:09:48] jonah had something against these people
[1:09:53] he didn't want them to be saved
[1:09:56] and you know what
[1:09:57] these were not god's elected jews
[1:10:00] they weren't the nation he was working
[1:10:02] with
[1:10:03] they weren't his chosen people
[1:10:06] it was a gentile nation
[1:10:08] amen and jonah is sent to them and he is
[1:10:12] he has a message of destruction but he's
[1:10:14] only to preach what god tells him to
[1:10:16] preach so he goes and tells them in 40
[1:10:18] days there's going to be a destruction i
[1:10:20] don't know what else he says but
[1:10:21] whatever he says causes them to repent
[1:10:24] and humble themselves in sackcloth and
[1:10:26] ashes and because god is gracious
[1:10:30] and merciful
[1:10:32] and kind
[1:10:36] oh
[1:10:38] i thought he was just a wrathful god
[1:10:39] full of judgment he's that too
[1:10:43] but he's gracious
[1:10:45] and merciful
[1:10:47] and kind
[1:10:48] slow to anger
[1:10:50] of great kindness
[1:10:52] and he repents of evil
[1:10:57] and jonah didn't want these people to be
[1:11:00] saved
[1:11:04] jonah wanted them to be cursed and
[1:11:06] condemned and die
[1:11:10] they were probably an enemy to israel
[1:11:14] and we know later they did become an
[1:11:15] enemy to israel we know in nahim they
[1:11:17] were finally destroyed
[1:11:19] god's righteous in all things
[1:11:22] but here jonah is sent with a message
[1:11:24] that message looks like a message of
[1:11:26] destruction but because of the
[1:11:28] repentance it becomes a message of life
[1:11:32] and god needed a vessel
[1:11:35] and jonah thought that he would be a
[1:11:38] messenger of destruction and a messenger
[1:11:40] of death and little did he know he was a
[1:11:42] messenger of life
[1:11:46] he thought in condemning their
[1:11:48] conditions and pointing out their sins
[1:11:50] and calling the judgment of god before
[1:11:52] them he thought that that would seal the
[1:11:54] deal amen but he he was inwardly afraid
[1:11:57] because he was afraid that once they
[1:11:59] knew what god thought of them they might
[1:12:01] repent and if they repent god is you
[1:12:04] know
[1:12:04] he he has great kindness
[1:12:08] this is a problem for jonah
[1:12:11] he's very gracious and full of mercy and
[1:12:14] has great kindness and he's slow to
[1:12:15] anger and he repented himself of evil
[1:12:17] this is a problem for jonah
[1:12:20] so he runs from the task i said god
[1:12:23] never let that be a problem for me amen
[1:12:26] god if you want to save amen save amen
[1:12:29] however you want to save and listen
[1:12:32] friends we know
[1:12:34] that there's going to be salvation
[1:12:35] dished out at the white throne judgment
[1:12:37] and there's going to be multitudes saved
[1:12:39] at the white throne judgment that are
[1:12:40] not the predestinated elect seed of god
[1:12:44] because the elect seed of god come up in
[1:12:46] the first resurrection everything else
[1:12:48] comes up in the second resurrection is
[1:12:50] judged and there'll be many in that
[1:12:52] judgment that are given entrance into
[1:12:53] the white or given entrance into eternal
[1:12:55] life
[1:12:58] and i don't want to be of the attitude
[1:13:00] of jonah
[1:13:02] i want there to be multitudes saved on
[1:13:04] that day i want to see everybody i know
[1:13:08] i want to see given life at the white
[1:13:10] throne judgment
[1:13:12] i can't make non-seed seed i can't
[1:13:15] change amen what is written in the in
[1:13:17] the section of eternal life in the
[1:13:19] lamb's book of life that's unchangeable
[1:13:21] amen but i would love to see everybody
[1:13:23] else saved amen and i have a message of
[1:13:26] life for them too
[1:13:31] a
[1:13:32] man
[1:13:36] jonah had the wrong attitude
[1:13:40] i don't want to have a jonah attitude
[1:13:44] sometimes you know when brother branham
[1:13:46] is condemning denominations and he is
[1:13:48] good at it
[1:13:50] how many believers are good at
[1:13:51] condemning denominations
[1:13:53] he always says now i'm not talking to
[1:13:55] you people that some of the loveliest
[1:13:56] people i know
[1:13:58] are in the catholic church
[1:14:01] is that what he said
[1:14:03] some of the greatest man i know
[1:14:05] is in the methodist church
[1:14:08] he said i'm not talking about the people
[1:14:10] i'm talking about the system
[1:14:13] and i hope that we can keep that
[1:14:15] separated
[1:14:18] i hope we can speak about the system and
[1:14:20] not speak about the people
[1:14:24] now we know there's people who make it a
[1:14:25] system we know that
[1:14:27] just like there was pharisees and
[1:14:28] sadducees and high priests and all and
[1:14:30] they they were guilty and they were
[1:14:31] wrong and they're condemned there's
[1:14:32] people who keep the system going and
[1:14:34] they're going to be they're condemned
[1:14:35] under that system but there's there some
[1:14:38] brother bam said some of the greatest
[1:14:40] man i know
[1:14:42] is this or is that or is this
[1:14:46] and i want to have the right attitude
[1:14:49] in the right approach
[1:14:51] brother branham
[1:14:53] tells us the message that day on calvary
[1:14:55] said he was just one man
[1:14:58] the perfect man
[1:14:59] he gave his life and he made an example
[1:15:01] for you now what must we do now the
[1:15:03] first thing i want to say is jesus never
[1:15:05] lived for himself his life was spent for
[1:15:08] others
[1:15:09] that's perfectly eternal life when you
[1:15:11] say you go to church and you do good
[1:15:13] things that's fine but when you live
[1:15:14] your life to yourself you have an
[1:15:16] eternal life eternal life is living for
[1:15:18] others it proved it when it came to the
[1:15:21] lamb of god he lived and had eternal
[1:15:23] life because he did not live for himself
[1:15:25] he lived for others and you receive
[1:15:27] eternal life by receiving that day and
[1:15:29] you don't live for yourself no more you
[1:15:32] live for others
[1:15:38] we have the same ministry
[1:15:41] this is a continuation of the ministry
[1:15:43] of jesus christ
[1:15:45] and he came and he gave a ministry a
[1:15:48] message
[1:15:50] for life
[1:15:51] not for condemnation
[1:15:54] for life
[1:15:55] brother branham's message was the same
[1:15:56] because it's the message of christ it's
[1:15:58] a message for life it's a message of
[1:16:00] life
[1:16:04] our message should be the same
[1:16:07] and we should live for others because
[1:16:09] that's what he did our life should be
[1:16:12] for others and say how is your life for
[1:16:13] others you know go to the soup kitchen
[1:16:15] and and do all that well we should we
[1:16:17] should do whatever we can brother bam
[1:16:18] said if i can do anything to make
[1:16:20] somebody's life a little bit better i
[1:16:21] want to do it
[1:16:23] so if we have opportunity to do good do
[1:16:25] it that's what the bible said if you
[1:16:26] have the opportunity to do good do it
[1:16:28] and do not be weary in well-doing
[1:16:30] so if you have opportunity do good do
[1:16:32] good
[1:16:33] but how can i live for others amen
[1:16:36] because i can recognize amen that my
[1:16:39] very existence on this earth is going to
[1:16:41] prevent a curse from coming upon this
[1:16:43] earth and as long as i'm here as far as
[1:16:46] i know there's an opportunity for
[1:16:48] somebody amen to come to life amen and i
[1:16:51] want i want to live my life for that
[1:16:53] reason i want to live my life for that
[1:16:55] purpose
[1:16:56] for others so that i have a broader
[1:16:59] vision of my life not a narrow vision of
[1:17:01] my life so that i don't get grumpy and
[1:17:03] cantankerous and down-hardened and
[1:17:05] become a hermit in my house and hate
[1:17:07] life and hate the government and
[1:17:12] stockpile guns and get a bunch of food
[1:17:14] and hide out in the basement and hate
[1:17:16] everybody because it's all corrupt and
[1:17:17] fallen apart amen what have i done i've
[1:17:20] removed myself
[1:17:23] from any opportunity that my existence
[1:17:25] will have on somebody else's eternal
[1:17:28] destination jesus says i don't pray to
[1:17:31] take you out of this world but i pray to
[1:17:33] keep you in the world
[1:17:36] to keep you while you're in the world
[1:17:37] amen because you have to be in the world
[1:17:40] amen but not of the world
[1:17:44] because your your very existence on this
[1:17:47] planet is opening a door
[1:17:51] creating an opportunity because it's a
[1:17:53] ministry of life
[1:17:56] i think if we see
[1:17:57] if we can just see that and keep it on
[1:17:59] the forefront of our minds amen it'll
[1:18:02] change the way we interact with
[1:18:03] everybody it'll change the way we think
[1:18:05] about individuals around us it'll change
[1:18:07] the way we react to situations
[1:18:12] because
[1:18:13] can we say in every situation we find
[1:18:15] ourselves in i'm in the place of god
[1:18:19] like joseph you meant it for evil you
[1:18:22] meant this and you meant to curse me and
[1:18:24] you meant the you know ridicule me and
[1:18:26] you meant to make me look bad in front
[1:18:28] of others
[1:18:29] but god meant it for good
[1:18:31] i'm in the place of god
[1:18:35] brother baby says in christ as the
[1:18:36] mystery god revealed this has become a
[1:18:38] very familiar quote to us but i want to
[1:18:40] i want to look at it for just a couple
[1:18:41] of minutes it says now you see the seals
[1:18:44] when he was in his mediator work back
[1:18:46] there redeeming but someday come forth
[1:18:48] to get the book that he's redeemed and
[1:18:50] all that's in this book would be him for
[1:18:52] that's the believer the words in the
[1:18:54] book and the word is him
[1:18:58] and all that's in that he came forth for
[1:19:00] this book of redemption whose names are
[1:19:01] written on the book before the
[1:19:02] foundation of the world when he was
[1:19:04] slain as a lamb so i just want to talk
[1:19:07] about this for a minute
[1:19:09] all that's in the book would be him
[1:19:13] so everything that's in the lamb's book
[1:19:15] of life is him
[1:19:17] it's actually a record of himself coming
[1:19:19] forth
[1:19:23] and that's the believer
[1:19:25] the words in the book
[1:19:27] so everything in the book the lamb's
[1:19:29] book of life is the record of eternal
[1:19:31] life it's the record of god's life
[1:19:34] it's the record of christ coming forth
[1:19:36] in each age
[1:19:38] and so the words in the book this is the
[1:19:40] record of christ the words in the book
[1:19:42] are the individual believers
[1:19:45] and it's all making up christ coming
[1:19:47] down through
[1:19:49] and so when we recognize what that is
[1:19:51] brother bannon says that was christ and
[1:19:54] moses that was christ in noah that was
[1:19:56] christ and abraham that was christ and
[1:19:58] david why they were the believers they
[1:20:00] were the words in the book
[1:20:03] and it was christ in them
[1:20:08] now
[1:20:09] when you find yourself in this place
[1:20:12] this is the lamb's book of life
[1:20:17] so it is the record of eternal life
[1:20:19] those attributes that already possess
[1:20:21] life that are already part of zoe life
[1:20:26] so that means if you're if you're an
[1:20:28] attribute of god and a word in that book
[1:20:31] then you are a possessor of eternal life
[1:20:35] zoe lies
[1:20:36] the life of christ is walking around in
[1:20:39] you and if that life is walking around
[1:20:41] in you amen somebody can come in contact
[1:20:44] with zoe life
[1:20:52] we have to
[1:20:54] maybe
[1:20:55] think more broad than we thought in the
[1:20:56] past think a little larger in scope than
[1:20:59] the way we've thought in the past
[1:21:03] i want to read a section out of the
[1:21:05] sardian church age when brother bannon
[1:21:07] talks about the names in the book of
[1:21:08] life
[1:21:09] and i want to start to look at that
[1:21:11] he says it is the second resurrection
[1:21:14] where the five foolish virgins come up
[1:21:16] notice they were virgins they did not
[1:21:18] have the holy spirit so they missed
[1:21:20] being in the bride
[1:21:21] while the five wives who had oil became
[1:21:23] the part of the bride
[1:21:26] but these people being a separated
[1:21:27] god-loving people
[1:21:29] and trying to abide in the word
[1:21:31] according to what they knew of it and
[1:21:33] being a help in the work of the lord
[1:21:37] i want you to pay attention to what he's
[1:21:39] saying
[1:21:41] trying to abide by the word according to
[1:21:43] what they knew of it and being a help in
[1:21:45] the work of the lord will come up at the
[1:21:47] end of time
[1:21:49] all these people had their names on the
[1:21:51] book of life and their names remain
[1:21:53] but
[1:21:54] but whose names did not remain
[1:21:57] those of the world system church who
[1:21:58] fought the bride will be those whose
[1:22:00] names are removed
[1:22:03] that is who will lose out they will be
[1:22:05] cast into the lake of fire now brother
[1:22:08] baby's going to talk about several
[1:22:09] categories of people that are going to
[1:22:11] be given entrance into eternal life at
[1:22:13] the white throne judgment and the first
[1:22:14] ones he's talking about is the foolish
[1:22:16] virgin and he describes him in many
[1:22:18] other places but he describes them here
[1:22:20] this way amen they tried to abide in the
[1:22:22] word as much as they know of it so as
[1:22:24] much of the word they know they tried to
[1:22:25] abide in it
[1:22:28] and they're being a help in the work of
[1:22:29] the lord
[1:22:32] what are they doing they're working with
[1:22:34] god not against god
[1:22:38] they're being a help in the work of the
[1:22:40] lord they're working with the plan of
[1:22:42] god they're working with the program of
[1:22:45] god they're working in conjunction with
[1:22:47] the way god's working they're not
[1:22:48] working against it whose names are
[1:22:50] removed those who fight the bride
[1:22:54] why why is it those who fight the bride
[1:22:56] amen it's not listen it's not because my
[1:23:00] neighbor and i have a fight over whose
[1:23:01] walnuts these are
[1:23:04] that's not fighting the bride
[1:23:07] that's fighting your neighbor over
[1:23:08] walnuts
[1:23:10] not everybody who fights you for a
[1:23:12] parking spot has their name scratched
[1:23:13] off the book of life
[1:23:18] but the what is the bride the bride is
[1:23:20] the manifestation of the word the life
[1:23:22] of christ on display in this day the
[1:23:24] message of the hour amen when the those
[1:23:26] of the world church systems fight that
[1:23:28] their name is scratched off the book
[1:23:31] amen because why their name was removed
[1:23:35] because they hated the life they didn't
[1:23:37] want the light they rejected life they
[1:23:40] rejected the open door amen they
[1:23:42] condemned life
[1:23:47] but those whose names remain they did
[1:23:50] not fight the life condemned the life
[1:23:52] they actually were a help in the work of
[1:23:54] the lord
[1:23:56] how did they help i don't know you can
[1:23:58] think of all kinds of ways they can help
[1:24:00] i don't know how to define it all
[1:24:01] clearly amen but i know one thing
[1:24:04] they're helping in the work of the lord
[1:24:06] and the work of the lord is the message
[1:24:07] of the hour amen how much they help
[1:24:09] directly or indirectly i don't know they
[1:24:12] may be a help in the work of the lord
[1:24:13] because they still keep bibles going out
[1:24:18] they may be helping the work of the lord
[1:24:20] because they keep i don't know
[1:24:22] helping i don't know how
[1:24:24] you could use your imagination i don't
[1:24:26] know
[1:24:27] but they're they're helping in the work
[1:24:29] of the lord they're not against the work
[1:24:31] of the lord
[1:24:33] but when they're against the work of the
[1:24:34] lord
[1:24:36] they no longer have a right to life
[1:24:39] how come they no longer write the life
[1:24:41] because they're fighting life itself
[1:24:46] they're fighting life itself
[1:24:49] so how could they have right to life
[1:24:51] when they're fighting life
[1:24:54] what kind of life is in the bride
[1:24:56] eternal life they are fighting eternal
[1:24:58] life why would they be given entrance
[1:25:00] into eternal life when they're fighting
[1:25:02] eternal life
[1:25:05] but this other group who do not already
[1:25:08] have eternal life
[1:25:10] they're doing the best they can with
[1:25:12] what they've got and they're a help in
[1:25:14] the work of the lord they're supporting
[1:25:15] they're helping in some way directly or
[1:25:18] indirectly i don't know but they're
[1:25:19] helping in the work of the lord
[1:25:22] and because they're helping life
[1:25:26] they can have entrance into life
[1:25:30] god is a very very just god but he's
[1:25:33] full of kindness full of mercy and
[1:25:35] gracious
[1:25:40] god makes a way
[1:25:42] to come to life
[1:25:45] he makes a way to come to life
[1:25:48] even for multitudes who don't already
[1:25:50] have eternal life
[1:25:52] he makes a way to come to life
[1:25:56] what is that way
[1:25:58] he has vessels of his word that are here
[1:26:00] for salvation
[1:26:06] again in the sardisian church age
[1:26:09] thus if god has so designed that there
[1:26:11] be those whose names are placed in a
[1:26:13] section of the lamb's book of life and
[1:26:15] cannot be erased for they are the names
[1:26:17] of his bride then we must accept them if
[1:26:20] it also states that there are those
[1:26:21] whose names were placed in the record of
[1:26:23] the book of life but in the
[1:26:24] foreknowledge of god they were to fall
[1:26:26] and have their names removed we must
[1:26:28] accept that
[1:26:29] and if there are those names we're never
[1:26:32] placed upon the record of life we must
[1:26:33] accept that also
[1:26:35] and if there are those who will enter
[1:26:37] into life eternal after the white throne
[1:26:39] judgment solely
[1:26:42] on the grounds of being good and kind
[1:26:44] and just to the elect of god who are his
[1:26:47] brethren then we cannot but accept that
[1:26:51] i'm going to read that sentence again
[1:26:55] if there are those who will enter into
[1:26:58] life
[1:26:59] eternal after the white throne judgment
[1:27:01] solely
[1:27:03] this is for one purpose only
[1:27:06] for one reason only they got in
[1:27:08] solely on the grounds of being good and
[1:27:11] kind and just to the elect of god who
[1:27:14] are his brethren then we cannot but
[1:27:17] accept
[1:27:19] that
[1:27:21] why because he's full of grace and he's
[1:27:23] great in kindness
[1:27:28] you're telling me that there's a group
[1:27:30] of people that can come into eternal
[1:27:32] life after the white throne judgment
[1:27:34] solely
[1:27:36] do we know what solely means
[1:27:39] solely on the grounds they were good and
[1:27:41] kind and just to the elect of god
[1:27:45] he said then we must cannot accept that
[1:27:49] okay here's the question
[1:27:53] if none of the elect of god ever
[1:27:55] interact with another human being who
[1:27:57] has a chance at entering in on this
[1:28:00] [Applause]
[1:28:03] so why are you on the earth maybe your
[1:28:05] existence on the earth is to make a way
[1:28:07] of salvation for somebody who has no
[1:28:10] other way
[1:28:12] [Music]
[1:28:13] maybe you're here maybe it's not a
[1:28:15] message of death maybe it's a message of
[1:28:17] life maybe you're not here for
[1:28:19] condemnation maybe you're here for life
[1:28:21] [Music]
[1:28:23] maybe you're here so there can be a
[1:28:25] support amen in the work of the lord
[1:28:27] amen they'll get in that way maybe
[1:28:29] you're here because there's those that
[1:28:31] will solely enter in on grounds that
[1:28:33] they were kind they were good and kind
[1:28:36] and just to the elect of god amen if
[1:28:38] you're the elect of god amen you should
[1:28:40] be shouting right now and saying my very
[1:28:43] existence is creating an opportunity for
[1:28:45] somebody to get entrance into eternal
[1:28:47] life at the white throne judgment
[1:28:49] i am not here for death i am not here
[1:28:52] for condemnation i am here for life
[1:28:55] [Music]
[1:28:56] but what about those who fight the bride
[1:28:58] they're condemned already
[1:29:03] and then they just give themselves
[1:29:05] greater condemnation
[1:29:07] greater trouble greater problems amen it
[1:29:10] has made it worse
[1:29:12] but i can't help that
[1:29:14] i can't stop that from happening
[1:29:18] but that's not what i'm here for
[1:29:20] i'm here for life
[1:29:23] i have a message of life
[1:29:26] i have eternal life by the grace of god
[1:29:29] and eternal life is coming in contact
[1:29:33] with people all the time
[1:29:36] i say god give me eagle vision fly me up
[1:29:38] a little higher than i've ever been
[1:29:40] before so that i can really see what's
[1:29:41] going on all around me
[1:29:46] brother ben says in the message elisha
[1:29:48] the prophet from 1956
[1:29:50] says so this woman had seen god in the
[1:29:52] lie jim she said i think it's nice now
[1:29:54] if we do something for the servant she
[1:29:56] built a little room for him on the side
[1:29:58] of the house
[1:29:59] i i i think it's nice now if we do
[1:30:02] something for this servant of god god
[1:30:04] will respect it
[1:30:06] why she was just a few hundred years
[1:30:08] ahead of time jesus said if you give one
[1:30:10] of my disciples a cup of cold water at
[1:30:12] the judgment it won't be forgotten
[1:30:15] we fail to see the power that god has
[1:30:17] placed in his people god is in his
[1:30:19] people
[1:30:21] you believe that
[1:30:22] god was with his people one time when he
[1:30:24] walked on the earth but now god is in
[1:30:26] his people a little while the world sees
[1:30:27] me no more yet you'll see me for i
[1:30:30] personal pronoun now will be with you
[1:30:32] and in you to the end of the world
[1:30:35] this little woman respected elijah and
[1:30:38] saw she was he was a man of god and
[1:30:39] wanted to do a service for him and put a
[1:30:41] little room there for him to rest and
[1:30:43] god respected what she did for him
[1:30:46] and out of that she received a son and
[1:30:49] she was received life
[1:30:53] now back to the sardisian church age
[1:30:56] he goes on to say now then the record of
[1:30:58] this wheat plant whose end is to produce
[1:31:01] the original seed in multiplied form is
[1:31:03] the book of life
[1:31:05] so i'm not going to go fast i'm going to
[1:31:06] read quite a bit here as we wind down
[1:31:08] and finish up and i want to teach on
[1:31:10] this so so so don't wait for me to get
[1:31:12] all excited amen
[1:31:13] get excited by what the prophet is
[1:31:15] telling us
[1:31:17] because it matters to each one of us
[1:31:18] every day
[1:31:20] this what we're reading and learning now
[1:31:22] impacts every one of us every single day
[1:31:26] this is our life
[1:31:28] the record of this wheat plant whose end
[1:31:30] is to reproduce the original seed in
[1:31:32] multiplied form is the book of life
[1:31:35] so what is it it's the record of the
[1:31:37] seed which is christ the seed of abraham
[1:31:40] amen this the promised seed is christ
[1:31:42] amen as it goes to the process of being
[1:31:45] one into a multiplied seed at the end
[1:31:48] time amen that whole record is the
[1:31:50] record of the wheat plant is the book of
[1:31:51] life
[1:31:53] i repeat the history or record of this
[1:31:55] wheat plant is the book of life of which
[1:31:57] a part of the book of life is the record
[1:32:00] of eternal life
[1:32:02] a section of the book of life
[1:32:04] this is convincingly seen by examining
[1:32:06] the wheat plant
[1:32:07] a bear seed is sown soon a blade is seen
[1:32:10] but that is not the wheat yet
[1:32:12] then it grows into a stalk this is not
[1:32:14] yet wheat life is there but not the
[1:32:16] wheat then at the end of the stalk is a
[1:32:18] little spike that sends out a tassel
[1:32:21] still a wheat plant but no wheat yet
[1:32:23] then the plant is pollenized and we see
[1:32:25] the chaff grow this looks mighty like
[1:32:28] the wheat but is not yet seed then forms
[1:32:31] the wheat in the husk it is now back to
[1:32:33] what it was originally now the ripe and
[1:32:35] wheat is harvested
[1:32:37] jesus christ died he gave his life that
[1:32:40] life was to come back upon the church
[1:32:42] and bring many sons like unto himself
[1:32:44] unto glory in the resurrection
[1:32:47] but as the wheat seed had to have a
[1:32:48] carrier to bring forth multiplied wheat
[1:32:51] seed even so there had to be a church
[1:32:53] which would be the carrier of the life
[1:32:55] of christ
[1:32:56] as the blade stalked tussle and husks
[1:32:59] were the carriers for the seed but not
[1:33:01] the seed itself so the church corporate
[1:33:04] through the ages has been the carrier of
[1:33:05] the true seed though not the seed itself
[1:33:08] that is why we can say the book of life
[1:33:10] is the whole wheat plant
[1:33:13] now brother branham tells us and teaches
[1:33:15] us that there was true seed life in
[1:33:18] every age
[1:33:20] so in luther's age there was true seed
[1:33:22] life amen and that was uh in the land's
[1:33:25] book of life or the eternal life amen
[1:33:27] but it was being carried by the
[1:33:29] corporate church
[1:33:30] the corporate church was carrying within
[1:33:33] it the true seed life
[1:33:35] and then when it come up to wesley's age
[1:33:37] there was a corporate church and the
[1:33:39] corporate church was supporting and
[1:33:40] helping grow amen and supporting the
[1:33:42] true seed life but the true seed life
[1:33:44] was coming through that because the
[1:33:46] truth seed life wasn't going to be made
[1:33:48] manifest till it was back to original
[1:33:50] wheat again
[1:33:51] but there was true seed life through
[1:33:53] every age but around that was the
[1:33:55] corporate church bringing it through
[1:33:58] the corporate church is the book of life
[1:34:01] and the true record of the true seed
[1:34:03] life is the lamb's book of life
[1:34:05] a section of the book of life does that
[1:34:07] make sense
[1:34:11] let's go over that again
[1:34:13] here's that original seed that was
[1:34:14] planted it produced a blade that wasn't
[1:34:16] it it produces stalk not it either here
[1:34:18] comes husk which the wheat is to form
[1:34:20] that isn't it the tassel appears then
[1:34:22] pollen falls on those pistols part part
[1:34:25] of that plant is quick and something of
[1:34:26] that original seed that came up through
[1:34:28] the rest of that plant turns into seed
[1:34:31] why didn't the whole plant go into seed
[1:34:33] because it was created to that end just
[1:34:36] part of that plant can go back to being
[1:34:38] sea because just part of that wheat
[1:34:40] plant is eternal life wheat
[1:34:43] you have a perfect type of that in
[1:34:45] israel leaving egypt they came out and
[1:34:47] about 2 million strong all escaped
[1:34:49] through the sacrificial blood all were
[1:34:51] baptized in the red sea all came up out
[1:34:53] of the water and enjoyed the holy spirit
[1:34:55] manifestation and blessings
[1:34:57] all ate angel food all drank of the rock
[1:35:00] that followed them
[1:35:02] yet except for a very few they were not
[1:35:04] but carriers for the children who should
[1:35:06] follow them and go into canaanland
[1:35:08] all israel is not israel all but a tiny
[1:35:10] minority had their name blotted out of
[1:35:12] the book of life we have the same right
[1:35:15] today in the church names are going to
[1:35:16] be blotted out of the book of life
[1:35:18] no names will be blotted out of the book
[1:35:20] of eternal life for that is another
[1:35:22] record though contained in the book of
[1:35:24] life
[1:35:25] this is the record god hath given us
[1:35:27] eternal life and this life is in the son
[1:35:29] he that hath the son hath life eternal
[1:35:32] and he that hath not the son hath not
[1:35:33] life eternal
[1:35:35] and those who have that life were in him
[1:35:38] before the foundation of the world they
[1:35:40] were chosen in him before the foundation
[1:35:41] of the world that great royal seed jesus
[1:35:44] christ was planted he died and that life
[1:35:47] that was in him come up through the
[1:35:48] wheat plant and is reproducing itself in
[1:35:51] multitudes of wheat seeds having the
[1:35:53] same life in them and being like the
[1:35:55] original because by spirit they are
[1:35:58] original
[1:35:59] now we can see why the redeemed bought
[1:36:02] back by the original power bride why the
[1:36:04] redeemed bride
[1:36:06] she was in him as eve was in adam cannot
[1:36:08] ever have her member names taken off the
[1:36:11] record
[1:36:12] the bride can never have her name taken
[1:36:14] off the record of life
[1:36:17] because why she's part of him she's the
[1:36:19] same life he is
[1:36:20] you already have eternal life that
[1:36:22] predestinated sea gene on the inside is
[1:36:24] a part of zoe life has eternal life can
[1:36:27] never be scratched out because it can
[1:36:28] never lose life
[1:36:31] but there's those who are part of the
[1:36:33] book of life that don't yet have eternal
[1:36:35] life but at the white throne judgment
[1:36:37] they'll be given entrance into eternal
[1:36:39] life
[1:36:40] so they can receive life after time they
[1:36:43] can receive an entrance and come into
[1:36:45] eternal life after the white throne
[1:36:47] judgment they don't already have eternal
[1:36:49] life but there's a part that is part of
[1:36:51] christ that's coming down through each
[1:36:53] age amen written in the book the words
[1:36:55] in the book manifesting in their day and
[1:36:57] season they already have that eternal
[1:37:00] life that can never be removed
[1:37:03] but the other ones can have their name
[1:37:06] removed in the corporate church
[1:37:10] let's keep reading
[1:37:16] amen
[1:37:18] now we see why i'm sorry she is part of
[1:37:21] him she is in the throne she can never
[1:37:24] be judged everyone in the bride is a
[1:37:25] member of him and he loses none but that
[1:37:28] is not so concerning the all in the book
[1:37:30] of life for amongst them are even those
[1:37:32] like judas who have a part in the record
[1:37:34] but their names are removed
[1:37:36] we can see those who came in the last
[1:37:38] days and after having done wonderful
[1:37:39] works jesus will say that he never knew
[1:37:41] them
[1:37:42] is it not that he is not aware of them
[1:37:44] his omniscience precludes that but they
[1:37:47] were not for known as in the bride and
[1:37:49] neither were they foreknown as amongst
[1:37:51] the righteous of the second resurrection
[1:37:53] they bore no fruit because they were
[1:37:55] outside the word and did not abide in it
[1:37:58] and they therefore were sentenced to
[1:37:59] death
[1:38:00] then as we have previously shown there
[1:38:03] are those who stood for the bride and
[1:38:05] were an aide in a comfort to her
[1:38:07] those had their names remaining on the
[1:38:09] book of life and go into life
[1:38:11] everlasting
[1:38:12] finally there are those such as pharaoh
[1:38:14] who never had their names on the book of
[1:38:15] life
[1:38:16] and these are cast into the lake of fire
[1:38:18] also
[1:38:20] so we find in this record of life in
[1:38:22] this book of life the record of the
[1:38:24] wheat plant
[1:38:25] there are names of many there that were
[1:38:28] there as carriers are supporters of the
[1:38:30] true life
[1:38:33] i want that to become clear
[1:38:35] they were carrying supporting helping in
[1:38:38] the work of the lord standing up for
[1:38:42] being kind to and good and just to
[1:38:45] the true eternal life
[1:38:47] and because they supported that life and
[1:38:50] they were good to that life and they
[1:38:51] never fought against that life amen
[1:38:54] their names are in the book of life and
[1:38:55] they will receive life at the white
[1:38:57] throne judgment because they never
[1:38:59] fought life their role was to support
[1:39:01] life
[1:39:02] as it came through each
[1:39:04] age god would make sure that there were
[1:39:06] individuals there that would support the
[1:39:08] life that would carry the life that
[1:39:10] would be good to the life that would
[1:39:11] stand up for the life
[1:39:14] and god would make sure that they were
[1:39:16] there and if they stayed faithful to
[1:39:17] that calling and never rejected the life
[1:39:19] their names would remain on the book of
[1:39:21] life and at the white throne judgment
[1:39:23] because they supported life because they
[1:39:25] stood up for life because they they
[1:39:27] protected life they're going to be given
[1:39:29] entrance into life
[1:39:31] god is clear and just in everything that
[1:39:34] he does and he does everything for a
[1:39:35] reason
[1:39:37] that's why it's called the book of life
[1:39:39] that's why it's the record of life
[1:39:40] that's why it's eternal life that's why
[1:39:41] it's entrance into eternal life it all
[1:39:43] has to do with this life of christ as it
[1:39:45] moves down through
[1:39:49] now brother brahms asked a question in
[1:39:51] questions and answers in 1964
[1:39:54] he said brother branham who will
[1:39:55] populate the earth outside the heavenly
[1:39:57] city
[1:39:59] he says i hate to pass this by
[1:40:01] they're good questions i want my
[1:40:03] children to know these things see now
[1:40:06] who will populate the earth outside the
[1:40:07] city outside it will be the redeem that
[1:40:10] will populate the earth outside the city
[1:40:12] but they will not be the elected and
[1:40:14] called bride
[1:40:15] the bride will live inside the kingdom
[1:40:17] with the king on the outside will be the
[1:40:19] kings of the earth that labor and bring
[1:40:20] their toils bring their bring their
[1:40:22] fruits into the city and the doors will
[1:40:24] not be closed by night
[1:40:26] now this light on top of the mountain
[1:40:28] will not lighten the whole world it'll
[1:40:30] only lighten the city but it can be seen
[1:40:32] in the distance of thousands of miles
[1:40:34] maybe but it won't lighten the earth
[1:40:36] because the bible said in the new world
[1:40:38] that from one sabbath to another and
[1:40:40] from one new moon to another will the
[1:40:42] people come up before the lord and the
[1:40:43] zion up to the city to worship
[1:40:46] and now they will be
[1:40:48] outside the city not the bride but the
[1:40:50] people that come up in the second
[1:40:51] resurrection that will be tillers of the
[1:40:54] soil just like adam was and so forth and
[1:40:56] carriers of the carers of the garden but
[1:40:59] the king and queen will remain in the
[1:41:01] city
[1:41:02] i want to go to revelations 21 and i
[1:41:04] want to look at a couple scriptures
[1:41:05] there and then talk about this quote
[1:41:10] revelation 21.
[1:41:19] revelation 21 and verse 9
[1:41:25] and there came unto me one of the seven
[1:41:27] angels which had the seven vials full of
[1:41:29] the seven last flags and talked with me
[1:41:31] saying come hither i will show thee the
[1:41:33] bride the lamb's wife
[1:41:36] so now one of the angels one of the
[1:41:38] seven angels having one of the seven
[1:41:40] vials
[1:41:42] is going to show you the lamb's wife
[1:41:45] you're going to see the lamb's wife
[1:41:49] and he carried me away into the spirit
[1:41:50] to a great and high mountain and i
[1:41:52] allowed me and showed me that great city
[1:41:55] the holy jerusalem descending out of
[1:41:56] heaven from god having the glory of god
[1:41:59] and her light was like into a stone most
[1:42:00] precious even like jasper stone clear as
[1:42:03] crystal and then we read a description
[1:42:05] of a city
[1:42:06] but we were told we were going to see
[1:42:08] the lamb's wife
[1:42:10] and who was going to show us this one of
[1:42:11] the seven angels
[1:42:14] which seventh angel showed us the city
[1:42:16] and gave us the dimensions
[1:42:18] when you read further it gives us the
[1:42:19] dimensions in the shape of the city
[1:42:21] which of the seven angels gave us the
[1:42:23] dimension and shape of the city that
[1:42:25] seventh angels already preached future
[1:42:26] home
[1:42:28] and he was preaching right out of
[1:42:29] revelation 21. i mean it already showed
[1:42:32] us that city and what is that city that
[1:42:34] city is the redeemed that city is the
[1:42:37] people
[1:42:38] remember the book of revelation is a
[1:42:40] book of symbols it doesn't mean there
[1:42:42] won't be a city there in the new heavens
[1:42:44] and new earth but the city is the people
[1:42:46] not the building
[1:42:48] so she is the city the lamb's wife is
[1:42:51] the city is the new jerusalem she is
[1:42:54] that city
[1:42:58] now verse 23
[1:43:01] and the city had no need of sun neither
[1:43:03] a moon to shine in it for the glory of
[1:43:05] god did lighten it and the lamb is the
[1:43:08] light thereof now remember the word in
[1:43:11] the beginning it says in john 1 1 in the
[1:43:13] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:43:14] with god and the word was god and the
[1:43:16] word was light and life and that life
[1:43:19] was the light of men
[1:43:21] so light and life go together and it's
[1:43:24] the word
[1:43:26] and in the light and the lamb is the
[1:43:27] light thereof and the nations of them
[1:43:29] which are saved
[1:43:31] the nations of them which are saved
[1:43:33] shall walk in the light of it and the
[1:43:34] kings of the earth to bring their glory
[1:43:36] and honor into it and the gates of it
[1:43:38] shall not be shut at all by day for
[1:43:40] there shall be no night there
[1:43:43] praise be to god and they shall bring
[1:43:45] their glory and honor of the nations
[1:43:47] into it
[1:43:51] what are they doing
[1:43:53] i want to go and read a little bit
[1:43:54] further now in
[1:43:56] chapter 22 verse 1 and he showed me a
[1:43:59] pure river of water of life clearest
[1:44:00] crystal proceeding out of the throne of
[1:44:02] god and of the lamb and in the midst of
[1:44:04] the street of it on either side of the
[1:44:05] river was there the tree of life which
[1:44:07] bear 12 manner of fruits and yielded her
[1:44:10] fruit every month and the leaves of the
[1:44:12] tree were for the healing
[1:44:14] of the nations
[1:44:17] oh my goodness there's so much here but
[1:44:18] i'm just going to go to this quote
[1:44:20] brother branham says
[1:44:22] the leaves in future home he said the
[1:44:23] leaves will be for the healing of the
[1:44:25] nations that is the kings that live in
[1:44:27] there bring their honor in when they
[1:44:29] bring their honor in and lay it before
[1:44:30] the throne of god just like the outside
[1:44:32] the eleven tribes brought in every one
[1:44:34] of them a tenth to levi
[1:44:36] what's he typing it with what are they
[1:44:38] bringing they're bringing their tithe
[1:44:40] into the city
[1:44:42] they're working brother bam said they're
[1:44:43] working like tillers like adam in all
[1:44:45] the land amen they're bringing their
[1:44:47] fruits they're bringing offerings
[1:44:48] they're bringing their glory and honor
[1:44:50] and they're bringing it up into the city
[1:44:53] all right
[1:44:54] this is really important
[1:44:57] amen
[1:44:59] they do they're doing like the 11 tribes
[1:45:01] every one bring a tenth to levi when
[1:45:03] they bring their honor and two from the
[1:45:05] blessed land and that they'll reach from
[1:45:07] the tree of life and break off a tree of
[1:45:09] life leaf and they'll walk out together
[1:45:11] there's no more war everything is at
[1:45:13] peace the leaves are memorial for the
[1:45:15] healing of the nations
[1:45:17] so this means that these kings and these
[1:45:19] nations are laboring and toiling amen
[1:45:22] like like in the garden of eden like
[1:45:23] adam amen tiller of the soil they're
[1:45:26] working in there and they're bringing
[1:45:27] their glory and honor they're bringing
[1:45:28] their tithe into the city and when they
[1:45:30] bring their tithe into the city amen in
[1:45:33] exchange for bringing all the fruits and
[1:45:35] the tithe they get to take of the tree
[1:45:38] of life
[1:45:40] for the healing of the nations so
[1:45:42] there's an exchange taking place
[1:45:44] these people are supporting life in the
[1:45:46] city
[1:45:48] for supporting life in the city what
[1:45:50] life is in the city it's eternal life
[1:45:52] the life of jesus christ it's christ and
[1:45:55] his bride united together in the city
[1:45:57] it's the elect predestinated seed it is
[1:46:00] the seed of christ it is the the
[1:46:02] children of god the attributes of god
[1:46:03] they're the city dwellers
[1:46:06] and now in the future home when they
[1:46:08] bring their tithe and offering to
[1:46:10] support life in the city because they
[1:46:12] support life in the city they get to
[1:46:14] partake of the tree of life to have
[1:46:16] perpetual life there's an exchange
[1:46:18] taking place and this exchange matches
[1:46:20] the very reason why they're there
[1:46:23] they're there because in life they
[1:46:25] supported the life whenever they saw it
[1:46:27] whether they were just good and kind and
[1:46:29] just to the bride stood up for the bride
[1:46:31] or was a helper in the work of the
[1:46:32] ministry and tried to work with the word
[1:46:34] as much as they knew it whatever reason
[1:46:36] they were a supporter of life so in the
[1:46:38] future home they're a supporter of city
[1:46:40] life
[1:46:42] and because in their earthly journey
[1:46:44] they supported the eternal life they
[1:46:46] were they were allowed to entrance into
[1:46:48] eternal life because they supported life
[1:46:50] they got life
[1:46:52] and now in the city in the future home
[1:46:55] because they support city life they get
[1:46:57] life from the tree of life
[1:47:00] you realize they're not the tree of life
[1:47:02] they don't have leaves themselves
[1:47:05] they're getting their life from the tree
[1:47:07] of life and the tree of life is
[1:47:09] bridegroom and bride tree united back
[1:47:10] together again
[1:47:14] the bible
[1:47:15] is perfect
[1:47:16] [Music]
[1:47:18] perfect
[1:47:29] there's a question comes in questions
[1:47:30] and answers from 64.
[1:47:33] said after the bride is raptured will
[1:47:34] any of the foolish virgins be saved or
[1:47:36] will they be all will they all be lost
[1:47:39] no see
[1:47:41] everything will be finished for the
[1:47:42] gentile church when the bride is taken
[1:47:44] from the earth
[1:47:45] the spirit of god leaves the earth
[1:47:47] he that's filthy is filthy still he
[1:47:49] that's righteous is righteous still he
[1:47:50] that's holy is holy still
[1:47:56] what's he saying
[1:47:58] when the
[1:47:59] when when the bride goes up and
[1:48:01] completely is completely raptured
[1:48:04] will the foolish virgin will any of them
[1:48:06] be saved or will they all be lost
[1:48:09] and brother branham says no they stay
[1:48:11] what they are
[1:48:13] he that's righteous is righteous still
[1:48:15] he is to fill these films he that's holy
[1:48:16] is holy still so when the bride goes up
[1:48:19] the spirit leaves when the life the
[1:48:21] eternal life leaves the earth for the
[1:48:23] gentiles they can no longer change their
[1:48:26] status because their status in the book
[1:48:27] of life depends on how they conduct
[1:48:30] themselves with eternal life
[1:48:32] so now when god removes the spirit and
[1:48:34] removes the life of eternal life from
[1:48:36] the earth for the gentiles amen now
[1:48:38] whatever they are is locked they cannot
[1:48:41] change because now they can't fight the
[1:48:43] eternal life or now they can't support
[1:48:45] the eternal life anymore
[1:48:48] so god is showing us the white throne
[1:48:50] judgment has everything to do with what
[1:48:52] you do with eternal life when you come
[1:48:54] in contact with it
[1:48:56] you keep the best you can the word that
[1:48:58] you've come in contact with and are
[1:48:59] working to help in a ministry or you are
[1:49:02] good and kind and just to the bride or
[1:49:04] you stand up for them and defend them
[1:49:06] for whatever reason what you did with
[1:49:08] eternal life in life determines what
[1:49:11] kind of life you have after the white
[1:49:13] throne judgment
[1:49:16] and then you just continue doing what
[1:49:18] you did to get there
[1:49:23] amen the bible is perfect this message
[1:49:26] is perfect amen it explains everything
[1:49:31] so what does that mean
[1:49:34] what does that mean
[1:49:37] well i'm still here
[1:49:40] are you still here
[1:49:44] that means
[1:49:46] somebody
[1:49:48] can still affect the eternal destination
[1:49:52] because the spirit of god is still here
[1:49:54] eternal life is still here
[1:49:57] we're not just here
[1:49:59] to do whatever we want to do
[1:50:01] we're here for life friends
[1:50:04] there's an opportunity at life
[1:50:06] right here well if somebody rejects that
[1:50:08] and somebody fights that their name will
[1:50:10] be taken off that's fine but that's not
[1:50:11] my focus that's not my that's not what
[1:50:13] i'm here for
[1:50:15] i'm here for life
[1:50:19] i don't have to get in order for
[1:50:20] somebody to receive life at the white
[1:50:22] throne judgment they do not have to come
[1:50:24] to church with me
[1:50:28] they do not have to believe everything i
[1:50:29] believe
[1:50:31] they do not have to confess that they
[1:50:33] believe malachi 4's brother bram is the
[1:50:35] fulfillment of that they don't have to
[1:50:36] to receive life the
[1:50:38] at the white throne judgment
[1:50:40] but what they have to do is respect and
[1:50:43] honor that life that's in me amen that
[1:50:45] word life that's living through me they
[1:50:47] must respect it they must honor it amen
[1:50:49] god has people around you that love you
[1:50:51] not because you're lovable but there's
[1:50:53] something in you that they can't resist
[1:50:56] there's something about you that they
[1:50:58] they want to do something for you they
[1:50:59] want to talk to you they want to be kind
[1:51:01] to you i say don't brush that aside i
[1:51:03] said let them do it amen let them do a
[1:51:06] service to you let them be kind to you
[1:51:07] let them say something nice about say
[1:51:09] something nice to them so they'll say
[1:51:10] more nice things about you
[1:51:14] because and
[1:51:16] until she's taken out of the way and the
[1:51:18] spirit of god leaves and there's an
[1:51:20] opportunity for gentiles amen still to
[1:51:23] affect their judgment at the white
[1:51:24] throne judgment
[1:51:26] and i say oh god
[1:51:29] i want to see neighbors and co-workers
[1:51:31] family members
[1:51:35] and when we get to that city
[1:51:37] the gate is never closed by day
[1:51:40] and it's never night there
[1:51:43] so what does it mean the gate's never
[1:51:45] closed
[1:51:46] so that means there's unlimited access
[1:51:51] unlimited access back and forth
[1:51:55] oh friends you know we may think because
[1:51:58] we're the bride of jesus christ we know
[1:51:59] our position in the city we may feel
[1:52:01] like anything less than that would be
[1:52:03] disappointing but i guarantee nobody who
[1:52:06] gets over to the new heavens and new
[1:52:07] earth will be disappointed with where
[1:52:09] they're at
[1:52:12] if they're out working in a restored
[1:52:13] paradise
[1:52:16] they won't be able to wait to come and
[1:52:18] bring fruits and offerings and tithe
[1:52:20] into the city and they'll be so excited
[1:52:22] and listen we we think we think carnally
[1:52:25] so much we think that they have to walk
[1:52:26] in and they got to drop a few apples and
[1:52:28] go over and break off a limb and carry
[1:52:30] it out no it's an exchange they support
[1:52:33] life they get life support life get life
[1:52:35] it's a perpetual non-ending life because
[1:52:38] they're rewarded for what they did in
[1:52:40] natural life now in the new heavens and
[1:52:42] new earth it's just a continuation
[1:52:46] and nobody's going to be disappointed
[1:52:49] and nobody's going to feel cheated
[1:52:52] nobody's going to be robbed
[1:52:55] everybody is going to be so satisfied
[1:52:58] because they're going to see the justice
[1:52:59] of god the kindness of god the mercy and
[1:53:02] graciousness of our heavenly father
[1:53:06] you know so many people struggle with
[1:53:09] the fact that the lamb has taken the
[1:53:10] book
[1:53:12] such a struggle if the lamb has taken
[1:53:15] the book we know the lamb has to take
[1:53:16] the book or you can't open the seals
[1:53:19] and he has to open the seals at the time
[1:53:21] the seventh angel is on the earth
[1:53:24] there's no way to get around this but
[1:53:25] brother bam says some other very
[1:53:27] difficult things now the throne room
[1:53:29] becomes a judgment seat no more mercy
[1:53:31] and it becomes it becomes a scary thing
[1:53:37] but they fail to see
[1:53:40] that christ is hearing bride form
[1:53:46] he may have he may have taken the book
[1:53:48] and he may have opened the seals
[1:53:52] but he came in bright form
[1:53:54] and as long as she's still here
[1:53:56] she's standing in the door she's
[1:53:58] standing in the gap and she's saying
[1:54:01] come
[1:54:02] yes amen come out of her my people and
[1:54:04] be separate and he'll receive you come
[1:54:06] unto the water of life and drink come
[1:54:08] into the fountain of life and drink come
[1:54:11] the door's still open we're still here
[1:54:13] amen we have a message of life we're
[1:54:15] here for life there's still eternal life
[1:54:20] here well i don't want him to leave it i
[1:54:23] don't want him to leave the intercessory
[1:54:25] seat i don't want him to leave hey i
[1:54:27] want him to leave amen it's time for a
[1:54:29] transition it's time for him to open the
[1:54:32] seals no more carriers amen no more
[1:54:34] confusion now the life has come back
[1:54:36] into the sea amen and you think somebody
[1:54:39] doesn't have a chance at eternal life
[1:54:41] when the fullness has come back
[1:54:44] the full life of jesus christ and his
[1:54:46] bride you think that doesn't create
[1:54:48] opportunity for eternal life
[1:54:52] when the fullness of his life is here
[1:54:55] his life is here he is here
[1:54:58] [Music]
[1:55:01] i say it's a good thing he took the book
[1:55:06] because his life is here
[1:55:09] and if you're being judged on what you
[1:55:10] do with his life i want all the life
[1:55:12] here that we can get in as many vessels
[1:55:13] as we can get it in
[1:55:17] so that as many people as possible have
[1:55:19] a message of life preached to them
[1:55:22] and a demonstration of life demonstrated
[1:55:24] before them
[1:55:25] and they have an opportunity
[1:55:27] at life
[1:55:30] say god
[1:55:31] adjust my attitude
[1:55:34] god take away my jonah thinking
[1:55:39] take away my jonah attitude
[1:55:42] take away amen all the wrong thinking
[1:55:44] and the wrong attitudes
[1:55:46] help me to be like joseph i'm in the
[1:55:48] place of god
[1:55:50] i've been rejected
[1:55:52] called names
[1:55:53] lied about misunderstood i've made
[1:55:56] mistakes
[1:55:57] we've got all this all this going on but
[1:55:59] i'm in the place of god
[1:56:01] and god has me here for life
[1:56:04] god brought me here for life god has me
[1:56:06] here for life i'm in this day for life
[1:56:10] and i have a message of life
[1:56:12] to reject that is a remaining death
[1:56:16] but that's not what i'm here for
[1:56:18] i'm here for life
[1:56:20] are you here for life
[1:56:22] oh what a blessed privilege it is to
[1:56:25] know these things
[1:56:26] friend there's no more wrestling with
[1:56:29] somebody and twisting their arm to make
[1:56:31] them say things they don't believe
[1:56:33] because somehow they can't they can't
[1:56:35] come into eternal life if they don't say
[1:56:37] william branham was a prophet of god i
[1:56:38] believe malachi 4 revelation 10 7 and
[1:56:41] now you're twisting people and trying to
[1:56:43] contort them and force them to confess
[1:56:45] things they don't even believe
[1:56:49] now the pressure's off
[1:56:51] that position and that confession is
[1:56:53] only for the predestinated elect
[1:56:57] but there's multitudes that can receive
[1:57:00] life
[1:57:01] by how they treat that life when it
[1:57:03] comes through the vessels of the word
[1:57:06] that are living in this day
[1:57:09] say god let me live the life so clear
[1:57:12] help me not to make it cloudy let my
[1:57:14] lamp be trimmed let my the globe be
[1:57:17] clean lord let me live this life and let
[1:57:19] me be like one of those clear crystal
[1:57:22] jasper stones in that city shining the
[1:57:24] light from the inside may it shine out
[1:57:26] with no obstruction and no cloudiness
[1:57:29] and no darkness
[1:57:31] let me and myself not hinder
[1:57:34] the shining forth of life
[1:57:37] so i said at the beginning when we catch
[1:57:39] the vision of this
[1:57:40] why we're here it's bigger than what we
[1:57:43] ever thought
[1:57:45] it means more and on that day of
[1:57:47] judgment it'll mean more to us then than
[1:57:49] it's ever meant
[1:57:52] and i say let's let's have our vision
[1:57:55] broadened
[1:57:57] let's fly on eagles wings prophetic
[1:57:59] wings and fly up above and look at the
[1:58:01] word until we can take it in perspective
[1:58:03] and say
[1:58:04] i want to live completely
[1:58:06] consecrated to this word
[1:58:09] i don't want to smudge it dirty it hide
[1:58:12] it
[1:58:13] i don't want to do anything
[1:58:15] because this is life
[1:58:17] and i want to have a clear
[1:58:19] clear reflection of the life of jesus
[1:58:21] christ
[1:58:23] it has an effect on people friends
[1:58:26] let's all stand let's pray as the
[1:58:28] musicians come
[1:58:34] oh there's so much
[1:58:36] god is so good
[1:58:40] you know friends these things have been
[1:58:41] mysteries for generations and
[1:58:43] generations but they're so clearly given
[1:58:46] to
[1:58:46] us we should be so thankful
[1:58:50] it should bring such peace and such rest
[1:58:52] to us
[1:58:54] knowing that god
[1:58:56] is a gracious god
[1:58:59] with great kindness and full of mercy
[1:59:02] and slow to anger
[1:59:04] and he repented themselves of evil
[1:59:07] that should make us smile when we go
[1:59:09] into work
[1:59:11] because there's people who are deserving
[1:59:13] of judgment they're in darkness and they
[1:59:15] got they they deserve it
[1:59:19] but yet you've got a message
[1:59:22] and you've got a message of life
[1:59:25] and you've got a god that is gracious
[1:59:27] and full of mercy and with great
[1:59:29] kindness and slow to anger
[1:59:32] and you have a message of life
[1:59:35] and there's an opportunity for life
[1:59:37] i say god
[1:59:39] help me to be true to this word
[1:59:42] not always in word but in life
[1:59:47] so that others can see the life
[1:59:49] and they can
[1:59:50] serve it respect it honor it be kind to
[1:59:53] it defend it
[1:59:56] how many people have stood up for you
[1:59:57] when other people were making fun of you
[1:59:59] for what you believe
[2:00:01] how many people said leave him alone
[2:00:03] leave her alone
[2:00:05] i wonder what that'll mean on that day
[2:00:07] of judgment
[2:00:10] oh we should be thankful for every
[2:00:12] opportunity and every time we hear
[2:00:13] something like that we should thank god
[2:00:16] and say god bless them and remember that
[2:00:18] at the day of judgment
[2:00:21] amen god bless you let's bow our heads
[2:00:22] and pray
[2:00:24] lord jesus we thank you
[2:00:27] for the privilege lord of being here
[2:00:30] and god
[2:00:31] it seems almost wrong
[2:00:34] as mortals to be able to hear these
[2:00:36] words
[2:00:38] to know these things that have been
[2:00:39] mysteries for generations and ages
[2:00:42] but now lord you just so clearly share
[2:00:45] it with us you so so clearly show us the
[2:00:49] word
[2:00:50] in god and it thrills our hearts and it
[2:00:52] excites us and
[2:00:54] ignites in us a greater desire to be
[2:00:56] more alive than we've ever been
[2:00:59] a greater desire to be here and be
[2:01:01] engaged and be life-giving
[2:01:04] we have greater desire than we've ever
[2:01:05] had
[2:01:06] lord god keep us in the right channel
[2:01:09] with the right attitude
[2:01:11] let us be like joseph lord and not like
[2:01:13] jonah
[2:01:15] let us remember that we're here we're in
[2:01:17] the place you put us and we're here for
[2:01:18] a reason and we're here to save life
[2:01:23] god we love you we ask that you would
[2:01:24] just forgive us lord of our narrow
[2:01:26] vision
[2:01:27] forgive us of our spiritual laziness
[2:01:30] forgive us lord of your compromise for
[2:01:32] god we know that's not what you called
[2:01:34] us to in this day but take all of those
[2:01:37] things out of us lord let more of your
[2:01:39] life take come in
[2:01:40] and manifest more of yourself through us
[2:01:42] lord
[2:01:44] and god because of each one of us
[2:01:47] may there be lives lord that are granted
[2:01:49] entrance to eternal life because when
[2:01:51] you lived in us they respected you
[2:01:54] they honored you in us
[2:01:56] and you give them entrance into life
[2:01:59] oh god let us see that lord let us
[2:02:02] witness it
[2:02:03] let us rejoice with them on the other
[2:02:05] side when they come into this the open
[2:02:08] the open gates of the city and have
[2:02:10] fellowship with us may we rejoice lord
[2:02:12] in what you've done in your goodness and
[2:02:14] your kindness and your mercy and your
[2:02:16] grace
[2:02:17] for god those are the attributes that i
[2:02:19] love and i'm thankful for
[2:02:21] god may you use us for your glory may
[2:02:23] you shine your light through us in a
[2:02:25] greater way than ever before and help us
[2:02:27] to be more diligent than we've ever been
[2:02:29] to stay on task
[2:02:31] for god it matters it matters more than
[2:02:33] we could imagine
[2:02:35] help us god we pray
[2:02:37] take preeminence among us live your life
