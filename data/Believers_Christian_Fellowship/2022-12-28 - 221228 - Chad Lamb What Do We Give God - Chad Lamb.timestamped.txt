[14:47] Christ's name
[14:49] amen
[14:51] may God bless you while you're standing
[14:52] let's take our Bibles and turn to Mark
[14:54] chapter 12.
[14:56] we'll read a portion of scripture from
[14:58] there and I say I was really
[15:00] disappointed to cancel service on Sunday
[15:02] especially Christmas morning it's such a
[15:05] unique opportunity to have service on
[15:07] Christmas morning and I was really
[15:09] disappointed but I I see the hand of God
[15:12] in it all and God is good and we thank
[15:14] God for that I'm so thankful nobody was
[15:16] got in trouble in the storm and what a
[15:19] unique storm I said I've never seen two
[15:20] or three inches of snow shut down shut
[15:23] down businesses and everything for two
[15:24] or three days
[15:26] so but we tried to go down to see my
[15:28] grandma Saturday morning got down the
[15:30] highway we got down so far we decided to
[15:31] turn around come back because it wasn't
[15:34] working out too well they had the
[15:35] highway shut down and the detour around
[15:37] the highway had a wreck on it and
[15:39] everything was bad so I come back and I
[15:41] just decided it's not going to work so
[15:43] it was a real disappointment but I'm so
[15:45] thankful to brother Franco that he was
[15:47] able to play that tape and I thoroughly
[15:49] enjoyed listening to that message and it
[15:52] just set the day off right for our
[15:54] family and uh and I have a testimony
[15:56] I'll share about that in just a minute
[15:57] but it was quite a blessing so it's good
[16:00] to be here tonight
[16:01] I pray you had a wonderful Christmas I
[16:03] want to pray it was a blessing to you
[16:05] and as we look to New Year I pray it's a
[16:07] blessing for you also amen Let's uh
[16:10] let's read here Mark chapter 12 verse
[16:12] 41.
[16:16] it says and Jesus sat over against the
[16:18] treasury and beheld how the people cast
[16:20] money into the treasury and many that
[16:22] were Rich cast in much and there were
[16:24] there came a certain poor Widow and she
[16:27] threw in two bites which make a farthing
[16:29] and he called into his disciples and
[16:32] saith unto them verily I say unto you
[16:35] that this poor Widow hath cast more in
[16:37] than all they which has cast into the
[16:39] treasury for all they did cast in of
[16:41] their abundance but she of her one did
[16:44] cast in all that she had even all her
[16:47] living amen God bless you as you take
[16:49] your seats we pray that God will bless
[16:51] us as we look at his word
[16:53] amen I just want to take a minute and
[16:55] say thank you to everybody who sent us
[16:56] cards and picture cards and gifts and
[16:59] cookies and treats and everything else
[17:02] we were really blessed by by your show
[17:04] of affection by your love and we love
[17:06] you all very much and we appreciate
[17:08] everything everything that you do every
[17:10] little thing every word everything you
[17:12] do it means a lot to us and so we really
[17:15] appreciate that also this Sunday will be
[17:17] the regular Sunday morning service it'll
[17:19] be New Year's Day and we're just going
[17:21] to have the morning service only and
[17:23] also want to remind you that we're not
[17:24] going to be opening the sanctuary
[17:26] Saturday night for prayer time we won't
[17:27] do that this Saturday we'll get back on
[17:29] the regular schedule next Saturday
[17:32] and I said before we played to take
[17:34] God's gifts always find their places and
[17:37] I was just led to that I was thinking
[17:39] Saturday of something to play for
[17:41] everybody I knew that many of us would
[17:43] be stuck in our homes and traveling
[17:45] wouldn't be that easy we weren't going
[17:46] to be gathering for church and I knew
[17:48] brother random preached so many
[17:49] wonderful Christmas messages and that he
[17:51] would title his Christmas message and
[17:53] and I was just drawn to this one for no
[17:55] particular reason but I felt a pull to
[17:57] it and I knew generally what it was
[17:59] about I've listened to it many times as
[18:01] many of you have so I just it was in my
[18:03] heart so I asked brother Franco if he
[18:05] could play and he did and that was
[18:06] wonderful but I had a message already to
[18:09] preach God had given a thought to me
[18:11] several weeks ago and I've been
[18:13] meditating on it and working on it and
[18:15] and so I was disappointed you know I
[18:17] couldn't come and preach what was on my
[18:19] heart for Christmas but as I sat and
[18:21] listened to the tape brother random goes
[18:23] right into an abortionate tape right
[18:25] into the very thing God was dealing with
[18:27] me some quotes I was looking for but
[18:30] couldn't find
[18:32] and I'm taking my paper out and writing
[18:35] down these these paragraph references so
[18:37] I can go back and look at it later and
[18:38] it was almost like God delayed this I
[18:41] mean uh uh for me anyways because there
[18:44] was a heart to this message a portion
[18:46] that really Consolidated for me as I was
[18:49] listening to the message so for me I was
[18:50] having a double Jubilee and I was
[18:53] thanking God for his goodness and for
[18:55] all the subtle things that he does those
[18:57] little directions that little guidance
[18:58] amen we can miss it so many times but
[19:01] God's hand is in our lives and I'm so
[19:03] thankful for that so even in our
[19:05] disappointment there's a blessing amen
[19:07] so God's been really really good to us
[19:09] and so I just wanted to say that for my
[19:12] title I wanted to take what do we give
[19:14] God
[19:16] what do we give God because you know at
[19:19] Christmas season everybody's thinking
[19:20] about the gift that God gave to us you
[19:23] know he he came as his only begotten son
[19:25] to give to us the Lamb of God for for
[19:27] the Redemption of our souls and we also
[19:30] think about the gifts you know as we
[19:32] were listening to the message the gifts
[19:33] that the the major I brought and the
[19:36] appropriate gifts that they brought and
[19:37] the gifts that we get maybe for our
[19:39] children or somebody gives to us and and
[19:41] there's so much but then I was thinking
[19:43] about what do we give God I mean what do
[19:45] you give somebody who created all things
[19:47] what do you give I mean there's always
[19:49] the question is what do you give to the
[19:50] person who's got everything and what do
[19:52] you give to the person who created
[19:54] everything
[19:55] and and so I had this thought in my
[19:57] heart and I'm just going to share with
[19:59] it as it has been given to me as I've
[20:01] been meditating on it for the last
[20:02] couple of weeks but we see here this
[20:04] this one oh and by the way before I
[20:07] forget today is another very special day
[20:08] because we have a special birthday in
[20:10] our family
[20:11] today is David's birthday happy birthday
[20:13] David
[20:14] amen
[20:17] his birthday being three days after
[20:19] Christmas it's always overshadowed by
[20:21] another event you know it's a happy
[20:23] birthday
[20:24] but uh as we look at this this uh
[20:28] portion out of the scripture where this
[20:29] woman throws in two mites
[20:32] it wasn't the amount of money that she
[20:34] threw into the treasury that impressed
[20:36] Christ
[20:37] it doesn't matter if there's two mites
[20:39] 10 mites 20 mice 200 mites one my it
[20:42] wasn't the amount of money that was
[20:43] impressive or caught his attention what
[20:45] he made note of is that she gave all
[20:48] and and what she brought was was much
[20:52] greater than what anybody else had
[20:54] brought in that day and that time that
[20:56] Jesus was standing there watching them
[20:58] bring to the treasury and deposit some
[21:00] large sums of money and no doubt there
[21:03] was many different kinds of offering or
[21:05] different types of people giving
[21:06] different amounts but the one that he
[21:08] noted was the one who gave all
[21:10] and and when we look at this it's it's
[21:14] in the scripture for a reason Jesus
[21:15] makes note of it to the disciples for a
[21:17] reason is because when God has given us
[21:20] everything I think the one thing that we
[21:23] can give God is everything
[21:26] and and what I've looked at here is God
[21:29] has has set up his laws his ways of
[21:34] operating and he doesn't change them and
[21:36] he's given us free choice and set us up
[21:38] on free moral agency and God is not
[21:40] going to violate that law that he
[21:43] established he's given us the right to
[21:45] choose things in life we can choose how
[21:48] we spend our time how we spend our money
[21:50] choose there's there's so many choices
[21:52] that he gives us the choice amen and and
[21:55] God is not going to violate that law of
[21:59] free choice Amen to make us move in a
[22:02] certain way amen but God is actually
[22:04] leaving that free choice intact to show
[22:08] what's in our heart amen because God
[22:10] wants to know what's in our heart and
[22:12] there's a certain kind of worship God
[22:14] wants and there's a certain kind of
[22:15] worship that's pleasing to God and
[22:17] there's another kind of worship that's
[22:18] not pleasing to God
[22:20] and so this whole law of free choice is
[22:22] set in place and God's not forcing us
[22:25] into things amen but he's he's allowing
[22:28] the circumstances to be as they are to
[22:31] see what's in our heart and what's in
[22:33] our heart can be pleasing to God
[22:36] brother REM says in the in the message
[22:37] the unwelcomed Christ
[22:39] he says he's worth he's worthy of the
[22:41] best
[22:42] what do you do for him give him the
[22:44] leftover oh yes you run around all day
[22:47] and give him three minutes at night
[22:48] before you go to bed he deserves your
[22:50] best friend he deserves everything
[22:52] you've got but what do you do about it
[22:55] you give him just anything he takes it
[22:57] he takes it anywhere anyhow he takes it
[23:00] but she said I want the best and he's
[23:02] referring to the woman who bought the
[23:04] alabaster box of ointment amen and she
[23:06] went into the and she went into the
[23:08] place that sells the perfume and the
[23:10] ointments and she wanted the very best
[23:11] that she could get and she said I want
[23:14] the best and it cost her everything she
[23:16] had to get the best
[23:18] that's what you you ought to do give
[23:21] your best to give your best give him the
[23:23] best of your life give him the best of
[23:26] your songs give him all your talent give
[23:28] him everything you've got give him your
[23:30] feet give him your hands give him your
[23:32] eyes give him your mouth give him your
[23:34] ears give him your soul give him your
[23:36] heart give him give him your praise give
[23:40] him everything you've got Hallelujah
[23:42] he's deserving of the best
[23:45] amen
[23:46] there's a you know when whenever you
[23:49] preach a message like this I want to be
[23:51] very very careful that I'm not preaching
[23:54] in a way that brings condemnation
[23:55] because that's not the point the point
[23:56] is not to make everybody feel bad
[23:58] because if we keep reading quotes and
[24:00] keep reading scriptures we can get very
[24:02] quickly to the point where every one of
[24:04] us including me feels bad
[24:06] because have we all given all all the
[24:08] time no is there more that we could give
[24:10] yes can we do better absolutely I don't
[24:13] know if there's anybody here that says
[24:14] brother Ted not me I've done everything
[24:16] that I possibly can do there's no more
[24:18] to give
[24:19] so we can preach in a way that that
[24:21] brings condemnation but that's not the
[24:23] point the point is what's in our heart
[24:25] amen what do we want to give God what is
[24:28] he looking for and how how can we be
[24:30] pleasing to him amen
[24:32] you know it's it's so wonderful when you
[24:35] when you catch that little vision of
[24:38] something that your spouse wants or one
[24:40] of your children would like or or a
[24:42] friend and and you you get a little
[24:44] insight into their heart and there's
[24:45] something you can do to bless them and
[24:47] you know how exciting it is to get it or
[24:50] do it or make a plan or there's
[24:51] something you know exactly what they
[24:54] want or something they would like to do
[24:55] or a place they'd like to go or and you
[24:58] and you can and you can do it for them
[25:00] what you're doing is expressing what's
[25:02] in your heart and what you're expressing
[25:04] is your attitude about that person
[25:06] what you think about them amen by the
[25:09] gift you give or the service that you
[25:10] render or what you do and it's not a
[25:13] treachery it's not it's not a
[25:15] condemnation it's not I mean it's not
[25:18] trying to do something Amen to get out
[25:20] of trouble it's not trying to do
[25:22] something just to gain something it's
[25:24] just a pure motive just to please
[25:26] somebody
[25:27] and that's the way that I desire to
[25:29] serve God
[25:31] I can't say that I'm always there but
[25:33] that's my desire My Desire is to serve
[25:35] God to please God I want to find out
[25:37] what pleases him I want to find out what
[25:39] he's satisfied with and I want to give
[25:42] it willingly from a heart amen by free
[25:45] choice not because I have to to make it
[25:47] to Heaven one thing the message has done
[25:49] is take away the fear of being lost amen
[25:52] take away the fear of not making the
[25:54] Rapture not the true revelation of this
[25:56] word and who you really are takes away
[25:58] the fear so that we're not serving God
[26:01] out of a fear of missing something or
[26:03] being left behind but now we can serve
[26:05] God from a pure heart
[26:07] yeah so the very Revelation amen brings
[26:10] us the ability to serve God out of a
[26:12] pure heart
[26:14] and that's what I want
[26:16] let's turn to Exodus chapter 35 together
[26:20] there's a theme that's running through
[26:21] this 35th chapter of Exodus and I want
[26:23] to follow it through and catch this
[26:25] theme
[26:28] God is now going to give Moses
[26:31] instructions he's already given him
[26:33] instructions on the building of the
[26:34] Tabernacle and he's going to be
[26:36] instructing Moses on collecting the
[26:39] material for the Tabernacle and they're
[26:42] going to build it
[26:43] but this is how he he he sets it up and
[26:46] this is the instructions he gives Exodus
[26:48] chapter 35 verse 4.
[26:53] and Moses spake unto all the
[26:54] congregation of the children of Israel
[26:56] saying this is the thing which the Lord
[26:58] commanded saying so he's repeating what
[27:01] the Lord has said
[27:02] take you from among you an offering unto
[27:05] the Lord whosoever is of a willing heart
[27:09] let him bring it an offering of the Lord
[27:11] gold and silver and brass
[27:15] so when God was going to give
[27:17] instructions on how to build a
[27:19] tabernacle because the Tabernacle and
[27:21] all the vessels they were going to be uh
[27:24] they were going to create a tent a
[27:26] tabernacle a place where God would dwell
[27:28] in the midst of Israel in the midst of
[27:30] the camp he was going to make his
[27:32] presence with them amen and so now he's
[27:35] telling them that they need to gather
[27:37] the materials to make this but he
[27:39] doesn't want forced worship
[27:42] he doesn't want you to be obligated in
[27:45] this offering Amen in this offering is
[27:48] to build a tabernacle where God will
[27:50] come and dwell right in the middle of
[27:52] their camp and he will make his presence
[27:54] with them but he says bring it of
[27:56] everyone that bringeth it with a willing
[27:58] heart
[28:00] amen let's keep going now let's go down
[28:02] to verse 20.
[28:05] and all the congregation of the children
[28:06] of Israel departed from the presence of
[28:08] Moses and they came everyone whose heart
[28:11] stirred him up and everyone whom his
[28:14] Spirit made willing and they brought the
[28:16] Lord's offering
[28:17] to the work of the Tabernacle of the
[28:19] congregation and for all his service and
[28:22] for the holy garments and they came both
[28:24] men and women as many as were
[28:26] willing-hearted and brought bracelets
[28:28] and earrings and rings and tablets and
[28:30] all jewels of gold and every man that
[28:33] offered offered an offering of gold unto
[28:35] the Lord
[28:36] I think it's amazing it says everyone
[28:38] that whose heart stirred him up
[28:42] and everyone whom Spirit made him
[28:44] willing it didn't say everybody
[28:47] but everybody whose heart was willing
[28:50] and whose Spirit stirred him up or made
[28:53] him made his heart willing amen both man
[28:55] and woman everyone whose heart was
[28:58] willing came and brought an offering and
[29:00] it's amazing the offering they brought
[29:02] because what they brought very closely
[29:04] matches the spoil they took out of Egypt
[29:07] so when they left Egypt God told them to
[29:10] spoil their neighbors borrow from your
[29:12] neighbors amen garments and gold and
[29:14] jewels and vessels and all of these
[29:15] things and they put them upon their
[29:17] children they put them upon themselves
[29:19] and they left with the spoil of Egypt
[29:21] gold and earrings and bracelets and
[29:23] jewels and garments and all of these
[29:25] things they took out of Egypt it's
[29:27] amazing that God did not say he did not
[29:30] say carry these out for me and for the
[29:33] Tabernacle that I'll build later he said
[29:35] you spoil and they all carried out and
[29:38] it was theirs
[29:39] it was in their hand it was theirs and
[29:42] when God asked for an offering a
[29:44] free-willed offering for every heart
[29:46] that's willing he's not saying remember
[29:49] in Egypt when I gave you the Rings and
[29:51] the bracelets and all of these things I
[29:52] want them back no they're yours you can
[29:55] do whatever you want with them but what
[29:57] you do with them chose what you think
[29:59] about me
[30:02] you know how hard did they work for all
[30:05] those gifts how hard did they work for
[30:08] all the the gold and the silver that
[30:10] They carried out of there and God gave
[30:11] it to him it was all the grace and the
[30:13] mercy of God but God's not demanding for
[30:16] it to come back but God's giving them an
[30:18] opportunity amen for them to express
[30:20] what they think of God and about his
[30:23] plan to live with them
[30:27] and so everyone who's heart stirred them
[30:29] up
[30:30] and everyone was a willing heart they
[30:32] brought gold and they brought silver and
[30:34] they brought all of these things that
[30:36] God had given to them and it's just
[30:38] amazing God has given what what is it
[30:41] that we have that God hasn't given us
[30:43] the breath that we breathe in and out of
[30:45] our lungs is a gift from God our
[30:47] existence on this Earth our jobs our
[30:50] money and our houses are everything we
[30:53] have has come from God and God's not
[30:55] saying you have to do this and you have
[30:57] to do that no you you can do with all of
[31:00] that as you choose but what we do with
[31:02] all of our time and all of our resources
[31:04] amen indicates what we think about God
[31:07] and his plan to be tabernacled in this
[31:09] earth in this day
[31:12] and say God help me
[31:15] this is an area I need help in amen
[31:19] let's look at verse 29 now same chapter
[31:22] 35 verse 29.
[31:27] the children of Israel brought a willing
[31:29] offering unto the Lord every man and
[31:32] woman whose heart made them willing to
[31:34] bring for all manner of work which the
[31:36] Lord had commanded to be made by the
[31:39] hand of Moses
[31:42] I tell you this is the way to serve God
[31:45] this is the way as a people to serve God
[31:48] of a willing heart if they came with a
[31:50] willing heart when their heart was
[31:52] stirred up they didn't come grudgingly
[31:54] they didn't come angry they didn't give
[31:56] but wish they didn't have to give they
[31:58] didn't they didn't give and talk about
[32:00] what a great sacrifice their giving was
[32:02] what what kind of sacrifice was it when
[32:04] God gave it to them amen
[32:06] and so many times our attitude about
[32:08] things about tithe and offering they
[32:11] just they indicate what we think about
[32:13] God
[32:15] they indicate what our attitude is
[32:18] towards God we think that we give our
[32:21] tithe amen and then we give an offering
[32:22] on top of that and we've done some great
[32:24] thing and we've given something to God
[32:26] to God Amen it's two minds it means it's
[32:29] not the amount of money he doesn't need
[32:31] money
[32:33] here's the cattle in a thousand hills
[32:35] it's not the amount of money that's
[32:37] given that does something for God but
[32:39] it's the Willing heart with joy amen
[32:42] doing something to please God because I
[32:45] know this pleases God because it's his
[32:46] word amen it's according to the word
[32:49] amen that he says test me try me bring
[32:52] an offering bring the tithe and see if I
[32:54] don't pour out a blessing amen God we
[32:57] know God is pleased with these things
[32:58] amen and so I don't have a thing I don't
[33:01] have a scent that I got myself
[33:05] all right so why why do I act like I've
[33:10] done God a favor
[33:11] by giving a tithe and an offering and
[33:14] talk about what great sacrifice that was
[33:16] what do you mean what sacrifice that was
[33:18] that was just I mean that was just an
[33:21] expression of God for giving me
[33:23] everything I've just given him a little
[33:25] bit amen I wish I could do more
[33:29] that's the attitude I want to have
[33:32] let's hold your place in Exodus slip
[33:34] your hand in there or bookmark but let's
[33:36] go over to the Gospel of John
[33:38] John chapter 14.
[33:51] John Chapter 14 verse 15.
[33:55] in John 14 and 15 Jesus says if you love
[33:58] me
[33:59] keep my Commandments
[34:01] it's such a simple little verse if you
[34:04] love me keep my Commandments
[34:07] what what Jesus is not talking about is
[34:11] you better keep my Commandments
[34:14] if you know what's good for you keep my
[34:16] Commandments if you want me to deal
[34:18] fairly with you no what he's saying is
[34:20] you can express your love to me
[34:24] by just obeying me
[34:26] like not
[34:29] it's so simple but it's not a it's not
[34:32] he's not talking about you have to you
[34:34] must you do it or else it's not any of
[34:37] that he's just making a statement if you
[34:39] love me keep my Commandments don't don't
[34:42] don't go try to do some wonderful thing
[34:44] that I never asked you to do don't put
[34:47] some major effort in the wrong place but
[34:49] if you love me just do what I told you
[34:51] to do that that's an expression of love
[34:54] amen not because you have to you do it
[34:57] or else you do it or you're contempting
[34:59] to hell I I was preaching one time and I
[35:01] think I mentioned some time ago that
[35:03] I've had conversations with people in
[35:05] the workplace and and conversations with
[35:07] different ones and you start to mention
[35:10] things out of the scriptures what God
[35:12] desires for a man and a woman how to
[35:14] conduct themselves how to dress and and
[35:16] things like that and how marriage should
[35:19] be and all of these things and sometimes
[35:21] they'll ask you the question well if if
[35:23] I don't do that will I go to hell
[35:26] and you think to yourself is what what
[35:29] are you talking about we just read the
[35:31] scripture we just talked about what God
[35:34] Said what his desire is or what a
[35:36] prophet has declared to be God's desire
[35:38] for our relationships for our families
[35:40] for us in church and you said well I
[35:43] mean is it a heaven or hell issue
[35:46] I don't want to live for a heaven or
[35:48] hell issue amen I want to live to please
[35:51] the Lord amen if it's pleasing to him I
[35:53] it doesn't it may brother Branham he
[35:56] said I can go fishing every day I can go
[35:58] down to the bank of the river and fish
[36:00] every day of my life and be just as
[36:01] saved as I am now the message is taken
[36:04] away the scare
[36:05] now there's no scare but now there's a
[36:08] desire to say Lord what's pleasing to
[36:10] you
[36:13] amen let's go over to First John now
[36:16] I want to read one more scripture then
[36:18] go back to Exodus
[36:20] first John
[36:23] chapter 5.
[36:27] verse 1.
[36:34] whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
[36:36] Christ is born of God and everyone that
[36:39] loveth him that begotteth loveth him
[36:41] also that has begotten of him
[36:43] by this we know that we love the
[36:45] children of God when we love God and
[36:47] keep his Commandments for this is the
[36:49] love of God
[36:51] that we keep his Commandments and his
[36:53] Commandments are not Grievous
[36:56] this word Grievous means heavy or or
[36:59] weighted or burdensome or severe
[37:04] for us the the things that God asked is
[37:08] not a heavy burden
[37:10] if it's a heavy burden it's displaying
[37:13] what's in our heart
[37:15] towards God it's not a burdensome it's
[37:19] not Grievous to us God doesn't give the
[37:22] Commandment to be burdensome or to be
[37:24] Grievous that's not the Commandment amen
[37:26] the Commandments are really for our good
[37:29] but but for us the Commandment is not
[37:32] Grievous or burdensome or severe to us
[37:36] it's a pleasure to know what's in his
[37:38] mind
[37:39] it's a pleasure to know what he desires
[37:42] I told you we'd go right back to Exodus
[37:44] but I want to read one more before that
[37:46] in first Samuel so we're working our way
[37:48] back that direction
[37:49] so let's go to First Samuel chapter 15.
[37:59] first Samuel chapter 15.
[38:01] and verse 22.
[38:10] first Samuel 15 and 22.
[38:16] and Samus said hath the Lord as great
[38:19] delight and burn offerings and
[38:21] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[38:24] the Lord behold to obey is better than
[38:26] sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of
[38:29] rams
[38:30] we know the story well it's Saul Saul is
[38:33] serving gone he's not obeying the full
[38:35] word of God he's doing his own thing
[38:37] making excuses that he's making a
[38:38] sacrifice to God and this is Samuel's
[38:40] response what does God rather want does
[38:43] he want to sacrifice an offering or does
[38:45] he want obedience
[38:47] what because it all comes down to
[38:50] showing what you think of God
[38:52] what it really gets down to is what what
[38:55] is my attitude towards God and what do I
[38:58] think about God it's not about
[39:00] commandment keeping
[39:02] for the sake of commandment keeping
[39:04] it's not about rule keeping for the sake
[39:07] of rule keeping or rule keeping for the
[39:09] benefit of rule keeping does that make
[39:11] sense
[39:12] because we say if I do all these things
[39:14] then then God's required to bless me I'm
[39:16] doing all these things for a blessing
[39:17] well you know God will bless you if you
[39:20] obey God will bless you but do his thing
[39:21] but that's not really what I want to
[39:23] display I don't want to serve God just
[39:25] for selfish reasons I want to serve God
[39:27] in my gratitude for God Amen I want to
[39:30] please him because I love him and
[39:32] because of what he's done for me I have
[39:34] a heart of gratitude and I want to find
[39:36] some way to express that heart of
[39:37] gratitude and so gone we can say you
[39:41] know I've done all these wonderful
[39:42] things but I think when it really comes
[39:44] down to it we realize we've done nothing
[39:47] what can I give what can I give to God
[39:50] what can I as a human being give God
[39:53] what gift can I give him what can I do
[39:57] for him amen he's God Amen he's the he's
[40:00] the god of the universe he's the creator
[40:02] of all things what can I give to God man
[40:04] this woman had a desire to serve Jesus
[40:07] Christ she was an ill-famed woman so she
[40:09] went and took all her living to buy this
[40:12] box of ointment this Alabaster Box amen
[40:14] and and God she was going to break it
[40:17] and pour it out on the feet of the one
[40:19] who who designed and created the tree
[40:22] that the box was made out of Amen who
[40:24] who designed and created the very the
[40:27] very plants that the perfume came from
[40:29] amen it wasn't that she was giving to
[40:31] something he didn't have or giving them
[40:33] something he needed it wasn't the
[40:35] perfume it wasn't the Box amen he
[40:37] created all the material it was made out
[40:39] of I mean he could get more at any time
[40:41] amen but what was pleasing to him was a
[40:44] heart that would give everything amen
[40:46] would catch the vision would catch the
[40:48] appropriate time to catch the season and
[40:51] catch who's in our midst and be willing
[40:53] to sacrifice everything for that
[40:56] [Music]
[40:57] I mean she this was Jesus Christ this
[41:00] was God and flesh this was the word for
[41:02] their day this was the message of the
[41:04] hour and he was sitting in Simon's house
[41:06] amen rejected unwelcome unworshiped
[41:10] unserved amen and here was a woman who
[41:12] would take what she had amen and do give
[41:15] everything to serve the word
[41:19] amen you see it was the rejection of
[41:22] Christ and the acceptance of Christ and
[41:24] she caught the anointing for the hour
[41:27] [Music]
[41:29] and she gave everything for that
[41:31] anointing
[41:33] amen he had to be anointed for his
[41:35] burial
[41:36] he had to be welcomed he had to be
[41:39] worshiped he had to be kissed his feet
[41:42] had to be washed all these things had to
[41:44] take place there had to be somebody that
[41:46] would fulfill that not by restraint amen
[41:49] not by force amen not by law but there
[41:52] had to be somebody that would catch the
[41:54] hour that they were in and by
[41:56] inspiration would be willing to give up
[41:58] everything to serve the word
[42:01] there's nothing different about her day
[42:03] than our day
[42:06] we're living in the same kind of
[42:07] circumstances amen and Jesus deserves to
[42:11] be worshiped his feet deserve to be
[42:13] anointed
[42:14] question is who's going to do it
[42:16] I think we'd be climbing over top of
[42:18] each other for the opportunity
[42:21] let me do it let me give all let I mean
[42:23] if we could have I mean Jesus Christ in
[42:26] his physical form sitting here in the
[42:27] front unwelcomed unkissed ungreeted
[42:30] unwashed amen and you knew about it and
[42:32] they said who wants to be the first one
[42:34] it would be a Mad Dash to the front amen
[42:37] but I'm telling you he's here amen and
[42:40] the person of the word amen and there's
[42:42] an opportunity to give all to worship
[42:44] him to give all to greet him and love
[42:47] him and serve him
[42:49] amen
[42:51] let's see
[42:53] it's a shame that we have to live in
[42:55] these bodies I hate living in this body
[43:00] we get so distracted and we get so
[43:02] caught up in the cares of life and we
[43:04] get so busy about other things and and
[43:07] and I mean the same thing happens in our
[43:09] relationships it happens in friendships
[43:11] it happens with spouses it happens with
[43:13] uh your children children to parents
[43:15] parents to children we can get Coast so
[43:17] caught up we let the more important
[43:19] things go get neglected and we let our
[43:21] relationship with our spouse sometimes
[43:23] gets a little neglected because we're
[43:25] busy with something or with our kids or
[43:26] with one another amen that's just life
[43:29] amen that's life but we have to be
[43:31] diligent about saying you know what
[43:32] there's some things more important they
[43:35] mend than whether or not I accomplish
[43:36] this task there's some things more
[43:38] important than whether or not I get a
[43:40] promotion or whether or not I get ahead
[43:42] in life amen I don't want to get ahead
[43:44] in this life I want to serve God
[43:48] and so we constantly need this checkup
[43:50] amen where we say listen it's important
[43:53] that I recognize that I'm easily
[43:55] distracted
[43:57] I mean maybe you're not but I'm easily
[43:59] distracted
[44:02] and and I want to constantly be
[44:04] readdressing where I'm at
[44:07] and not let life Carry Me Away
[44:10] but I want to recognize who's in our
[44:12] midst
[44:13] and what am I doing to declare what I
[44:16] think about Jesus Christ in our midst
[44:20] because that's the real that's really
[44:22] what we're getting down to
[44:25] what I do
[44:27] about this Christ in our midst
[44:30] declares what I think about Christ in
[44:32] our midst
[44:36] look at Exodus 36 now we're following in
[44:39] this vein we've been in
[44:41] Exodus 36
[44:43] and we'll start at verse 2.
[44:46] and Moses called bezelil
[44:50] and the holy ebb and every wise-hearted
[44:52] man in whose heart the Lord had put
[44:54] wisdom even everyone whose heart stirred
[44:57] him up to come into the work to do it
[45:00] and they received them Moses all the
[45:01] offering which the children of Israel
[45:03] had brought for the work of the service
[45:05] of the sanctuary to make it with all
[45:08] and they brought yet unto him free
[45:09] offerings every morning and all the wise
[45:12] men that brought all the works of the
[45:14] sanctuary came every man from his work
[45:16] which they made
[45:17] and they spake unto Moses saying the
[45:19] people bring much more than enough for
[45:22] the service of the word which the Lord
[45:24] commanded to make and Moses gave
[45:26] commandment
[45:28] and Moses gave commandment and they
[45:30] caused it to be proclaimed throughout
[45:31] the camp saying let neither man nor
[45:34] woman make any more work for the
[45:35] offering of the sanctuary so the people
[45:37] were restrained from bringing
[45:41] praise be to God this is the this is the
[45:45] result of a willing heart
[45:48] this is this is a people who God said I
[45:51] only want free will offerings I'm not
[45:54] requiring every household do such and
[45:56] such I'm not requiring you give me
[45:58] everything that came from Egypt I'm only
[46:00] asking you to give what you want to give
[46:03] amen and when their heart was stirred up
[46:05] to give they gave an abundance much more
[46:07] than was needed until the worker said
[46:10] you have to make them stop we already
[46:12] have more than what we need and the
[46:14] people were restrained from giving I say
[46:17] praise be to God let that be the
[46:19] attitude of the Bride of Jesus Christ so
[46:22] there's never a lacking in the service
[46:24] of God but there's always an abundance
[46:26] where there's always now this is enough
[46:28] this is enough Whoa stop we have enough
[46:31] amen
[46:33] praise be to God and that was the result
[46:37] of coming from a willing heart let's
[46:40] read verse 7
[46:42] for the stuff they had was sufficient
[46:45] for all the work to make it and too much
[46:51] you know what
[46:53] if God had required of Moses to come out
[46:55] and said everybody has to do x y z
[46:59] there would have been everybody in the
[47:02] camp who was forced finding some little
[47:04] way to cheat
[47:06] or bring the minimum or interpret Moses
[47:09] said this I think he meant this
[47:13] but when the camp was stirred in their
[47:16] heart to give and gave willingly from a
[47:18] heart that wanted to give now they had
[47:20] sufficient and too much
[47:24] I think to me that's what God wants
[47:28] he's got everything
[47:30] but he drew attention to the Widow that
[47:32] gave all
[47:33] he drew attention to the to the Harlot
[47:35] who gave her whole living
[47:37] to anoint his feet
[47:40] what was he what was he showing us he
[47:43] wasn't showing us a repeat process now
[47:46] you just come Sunday morning empty all
[47:48] your bank accounts and dump everything
[47:50] in the offering box and no that's not
[47:52] what he's talking about he's not about
[47:54] just repeat what she did you take the
[47:56] attitude she had amen the spirit that
[47:59] she came in the willingness to give amen
[48:01] that's what God is looking for
[48:04] that's my desire to live that way amen
[48:07] and however God leads me whether we sell
[48:10] off or alabaster box of anointment are
[48:12] put all in the treasury or or do
[48:14] something else amen he he moved the
[48:17] Apostle Paul to give up everything and
[48:19] count everything he had as though it
[48:21] were done so that he might win Christ
[48:22] and give his whole life to preaching the
[48:24] gospel it wasn't it wasn't a mountain of
[48:27] Treasury it wasn't a melon Alabaster Box
[48:29] it was his life of service that he
[48:31] wanted from Paul
[48:33] and I want to give willingly
[48:36] let's turn to Luke chapter 17.
[48:50] like I said right from the beginning
[48:53] I feel
[48:55] so when I bring a message like this is
[48:58] stirring on my heart so cautious not to
[49:00] bring condemnation because that's not
[49:02] the point
[49:03] the point is we're talking about what we
[49:06] all want
[49:08] not not hammering down we didn't do good
[49:12] enough here we should do that and we're
[49:14] all you know we're we're all letting Leo
[49:16] to see a creep and we all know we're
[49:17] letting later see a creep in
[49:20] it's all around us it's knocking on our
[49:21] door it's penetrating every crack amen
[49:23] you leave the door open this month later
[49:25] to see us creeping in amen we know that
[49:27] amen we don't need somebody to pound us
[49:29] over the head and say you know you're
[49:31] not doing this and you're not doing it
[49:33] we we know full well amen what's around
[49:35] us and what we're subject to remember
[49:37] what we need to see is for somebody to
[49:40] say this is what's in the heart of the
[49:42] believer and for us to say that's what's
[49:43] in my heart
[49:45] that's what I want even when I fail
[49:47] that's what I want amen even when I look
[49:50] at the end of the day and said I've
[49:51] wasted time it wasn't what I wanted what
[49:53] I want is to give God everything I want
[49:55] to give him my best amen and I want to
[49:57] go from here not saying oh I should have
[50:00] done this and I messed up and I'm no
[50:01] good and I'm not a good believer but
[50:03] walk out the doors and say that's
[50:05] exactly what's in my heart God help me
[50:07] tomorrow to give my best help me
[50:09] tomorrow to give my all forgive me for
[50:11] what I've done but you've set my feet
[50:13] back on the course that's in my heart
[50:15] man amen you'll never get somebody you
[50:19] can get people to perform under threats
[50:20] you can get people to perform under
[50:22] rewards you can get there's all kinds of
[50:24] ways to get people to shape up and toe
[50:26] the line and all of that but God doesn't
[50:28] even want that what God wants is a
[50:30] willing heart amen somebody that serves
[50:32] him from a willing heart that's why he
[50:34] gave free choice and won't violate it
[50:37] because that's what he's looking for
[50:41] and so in the preaching we don't want to
[50:43] violate that
[50:45] we just we all know what condition we're
[50:47] in we all know that the age that we're
[50:50] stuck in
[50:51] we all know what's all around us
[50:54] you know brother Benham he was preaching
[50:57] the God of this evil age
[50:59] I don't have this quote so I'm just
[51:00] quoting by memory but he in the God of
[51:03] this evil age he's talking about he says
[51:05] Jesus is the God of this this age
[51:09] he said there's a God of this evil age
[51:10] and it's Satan he's the God of this evil
[51:13] age
[51:13] and he asked the question he says now
[51:16] has God lost control
[51:19] or is he allowed this for another
[51:21] purpose
[51:22] [Music]
[51:24] I mean you hear the news you look around
[51:27] you go to the store you drive down the
[51:30] street the question is has God lost
[51:32] control
[51:34] or has he allowed this for another
[51:36] purpose
[51:37] and then brother Brown tells us the
[51:39] purpose and God is evil age he said what
[51:42] is this evil age for this evil age is to
[51:46] prove to Satan she's not like Eve
[51:49] [Music]
[51:50] so you say why has God allowed it God
[51:53] has allowed everything that happened the
[51:55] evil wickedness of this age he's allowed
[51:58] it to prove you to Satan that you're not
[52:00] going to fall the way even no matter
[52:02] what device is in your pocket no matter
[52:05] how available entertainment is no matter
[52:07] how easy it is to take money and lavish
[52:09] it on yourself no matter what conditions
[52:11] are in the world today you're not going
[52:13] to leave the word
[52:15] amen not because somebody amen not
[52:18] because somebody's checking your
[52:20] accounts amen not because somebody's
[52:22] looking over your shoulder when you're
[52:23] on the phone amen you can go unchecked
[52:26] amen
[52:29] we're not creating we're not creating a
[52:31] a message search engine that's filtered
[52:34] amen it's all available everything is
[52:36] available it's at your fingertips it's
[52:38] in your pocket it's it's by every way
[52:41] that you can get it and keep it as
[52:43] private as you possibly could what's it
[52:45] for watch this evil age for it's to
[52:48] prove to Satan she's not like Eve she
[52:51] will stay with the word
[52:54] praise God
[52:56] Isaiah I wish he'd make it easier I wish
[52:59] he would stop he's not going to stop it
[53:01] he didn't want to make it easier what he
[53:03] wants to do is show what's in the heart
[53:05] of the believer
[53:08] and what we want so many times is for
[53:11] God to put restraints on us and lock us
[53:14] down and trap us in a in a dungeon and
[53:17] not let not let us fail
[53:20] I've prayed that many times
[53:22] God if you could just stop me
[53:25] if you could just I prayed so many times
[53:28] in the past a lot of you could just stop
[53:30] me where where I wouldn't but you know
[53:32] what it took a new birth
[53:35] and it took yielding to the Lord and
[53:38] growing in the Lord and my desires
[53:40] changing and staying yielded to that and
[53:43] in that atmosphere and environment and
[53:45] washing out all the desire for sin amen
[53:48] and it now you get to the point where
[53:50] God doesn't have to lock you in a
[53:52] dungeon God doesn't have to lock you
[53:53] away from the world he can sit you right
[53:55] in the middle of Satan's Eden and you're
[53:57] not going to fall like efell you're not
[54:00] going to leave this word yeah
[54:02] doesn't mean you're perfect and you
[54:03] won't make a mistake that's not what I'm
[54:05] saying the saying is you're not turning
[54:06] away from this word for any of the
[54:09] pleasures of the world
[54:10] [Music]
[54:11] so as God lost control or is he allowed
[54:13] it for another purpose
[54:15] how many times I wish my children didn't
[54:17] have to grow up with all the vileness
[54:19] all around them
[54:21] but they were born for this day too
[54:24] they were placed here intentionally
[54:27] I have to trust God that God knows what
[54:29] he's doing I wish my children didn't
[54:31] have to go to Walmart and see what they
[54:34] see in Walmart I wish they weren't
[54:35] exposed to the the things that they see
[54:37] and the things that they hear I wish
[54:39] they weren't but God knew they would be
[54:41] and God didn't lose control God allows
[54:44] another Force to take over to bring
[54:46] Satan's Ease Into The Pinnacle so that
[54:49] he can prove in my children that they're
[54:51] not going to go like evil
[54:53] and I have to have confidence in what
[54:55] God has done amen amen if not I'll live
[54:57] fearful all my life amen and we're not
[55:00] here Overcomers are not here to cower in
[55:02] the corner and live fearful
[55:06] but God has allowed it
[55:09] to show what's in our heart
[55:14] let's look here Luke 17.
[55:18] verse 7.
[55:22] but which of you having a servant
[55:24] plowing or feeding cattle will say unto
[55:26] him by and by when he has come from the
[55:28] field go and sit down to meet and will
[55:31] not rather say unto him make ready we're
[55:33] with I'm a sup and gird thyself and
[55:35] serve me till I have eaten and drunken
[55:37] and afterward Thou shalt eat and drink
[55:40] does he thank that servant because he
[55:42] did the things that were commanded him I
[55:44] trial not so likewise ye when you shall
[55:47] have done all those things which are
[55:49] commanded you say we are unprofitable
[55:51] servants we have done that which was our
[55:54] duty to do
[55:57] my goodness
[56:00] we we do the minimum I went to church I
[56:04] read my Bible I paid my tithes and you
[56:07] could say I've done nothing
[56:10] because I'm yet an unprofitable servant
[56:12] because I only did that which was
[56:14] required
[56:16] God you know I don't think what we give
[56:19] God if I say I want to give to God I
[56:23] don't think minimal service is what I
[56:27] can give to God I think I can give more
[56:29] than just the minimum
[56:31] just what is required to be a believer I
[56:35] believe that I could please God by doing
[56:37] more than that
[56:41] brother Branham said in God's gifts
[56:42] always find their place this is where
[56:44] things started really connecting for me
[56:46] Sunday morning
[56:48] he said he said here there's only one
[56:51] gift that you can give and that is
[56:53] yourself
[56:55] give yourself to God because God's
[56:57] already give to you his gift now there's
[57:00] only there's only one thing you owe back
[57:03] to God that's yourself to him
[57:07] because of free choice because of free
[57:10] moral agency
[57:11] God has given you life
[57:14] and he's given you the the allowance to
[57:16] make choices in this life
[57:19] but what can I give to God when God has
[57:23] everything I can give him myself
[57:26] by choosing to give him myself
[57:31] let's look at Romans chapter 12.
[57:42] Romans chapter 12 and verse 1.
[57:49] it says I beseech you therefore Brethren
[57:52] by the mercies of God that you present
[57:54] your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy
[57:56] acceptable unto God which is your
[57:58] reasonable service and be not conformed
[58:01] to this world but be transformed by the
[58:03] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[58:04] what is that good and acceptable and
[58:06] perfect will of God
[58:09] so
[58:10] you know presenting our bodies a Living
[58:13] Sacrifice
[58:14] is our reasonable service
[58:17] it's not even extravagant service it's
[58:20] just reasonable service
[58:22] and God allows us to choose what will
[58:24] what will use our body for what we'll
[58:27] give our mind to and our time and energy
[58:29] he lets us make those choices amen but
[58:33] giving him our bodies is a Living
[58:34] Sacrifice is our reasonable service
[58:37] the prophet of God goes on to say in the
[58:39] same message God's gifts always find
[58:40] their places now God so anointed Jesus
[58:43] with the fullness of himself he was
[58:45] God's gift to the world that the wise
[58:48] men are clearly identified that they're
[58:50] offering their gift to him showed that
[58:53] in their heart they knew who he was
[58:56] and what he was going to do for them so
[58:58] no wonder the first thing they did they
[59:00] fell down perfectly in order and
[59:01] worshiped him before they could even
[59:03] understand it they fell down and
[59:04] worshiped him and then presented their
[59:06] gifts that's the way to have real
[59:08] Christmas worship him then present your
[59:10] gift presenting your body as a Living
[59:13] Sacrifice holy and acceptable to God
[59:16] what do we do we worship Him First We
[59:19] yield and surrendered to him to his word
[59:21] and then give our bodies to him as a
[59:23] Living Sacrifice that's the appropriate
[59:26] order
[59:27] and and brother Ben was saying in this
[59:29] message we listened to Sunday he was
[59:31] saying that the wise man's gift
[59:33] indicated that they knew who he was that
[59:36] they brought an appropriate gift for the
[59:38] one they were coming to worship they
[59:40] brought the gold the frankincense into
[59:42] myrrh speaking of his deity of his life
[59:44] of service and of his death and so their
[59:47] gifts were appropriate to the one that
[59:49] they were worshiping were and their gift
[59:51] declared who they believed him to be
[59:57] oh praise God I don't want to get ahead
[1:00:00] of myself but what we give God proves
[1:00:03] what we who we believe he is
[1:00:06] and what we think about him
[1:00:10] that's why I've said so many times and
[1:00:12] I'll say it over and over again I I care
[1:00:15] little for what comes out of somebody's
[1:00:17] mouth
[1:00:18] when their life is totally contrary to
[1:00:21] what they speak
[1:00:23] so many people talk about how much they
[1:00:25] love God but they will not do the basics
[1:00:28] to surrender their life to serve him
[1:00:31] they won't even do the basis I mean like
[1:00:34] the basis of just coming to services
[1:00:37] consistently paying tithes uh testifying
[1:00:42] of of God not even the basis but there's
[1:00:45] all kinds of I love God and I just love
[1:00:47] God so much and I'm I'm just loving God
[1:00:49] he said if you love me keep my
[1:00:52] Commandments it was so simple amen
[1:00:54] so the the love that kind of love is is
[1:00:58] a different kind of love amen it's still
[1:01:01] that self-centered love I love God but I
[1:01:04] don't love him enough to die to myself I
[1:01:06] don't love him enough to sacrifice for
[1:01:08] him it's really I love The God Who will
[1:01:11] do something for me amen but I want to
[1:01:13] have the kind of love where I love the
[1:01:15] god the God where I want to do something
[1:01:17] for him
[1:01:20] so
[1:01:22] brother bam says Grace is what God does
[1:01:25] for you works is what you do for God
[1:01:28] it's Grace that brings you to God it's
[1:01:30] Works to you do for God
[1:01:32] he says in the message the baptism of
[1:01:34] the Holy Spirit that's why we different
[1:01:36] with the Baptist the methodists and
[1:01:38] so-called calvinistic people but
[1:01:40] Calvinism is right then we're going to
[1:01:43] come over on the Armenian side what did
[1:01:44] they get works that's the Holiness group
[1:01:47] bless God I'll let my hair grow out the
[1:01:49] women say oh praise God I won't even
[1:01:50] wear a short sleeve shirt the men will
[1:01:52] say so forth like that that has nothing
[1:01:54] to do with the kingdom no sir you can
[1:01:57] let your hair grow long you can wear
[1:01:58] dresses whatever you want to or you can
[1:02:00] do this or do that or the other and it
[1:02:02] won't have nothing at all to do with it
[1:02:04] you're not saved because of your clothes
[1:02:06] it's God would just have made some
[1:02:09] patterns of such Jesus wouldn't have to
[1:02:11] had to die so he's saying if you could
[1:02:13] just get saved by doing the the the the
[1:02:15] works then Jesus wouldn't even have to
[1:02:17] die you could just do the works
[1:02:20] you're saved because that God saved you
[1:02:22] by grace and you do those things just in
[1:02:26] appreciation
[1:02:29] so important
[1:02:31] that's so important to note that that
[1:02:35] if we're not serving God just out of
[1:02:37] appreciation then we're serving for
[1:02:39] merit or for reward or for whatever
[1:02:44] but we've already been given everything
[1:02:46] from before the foundation of the world
[1:02:48] he's already purchased Amen in God's
[1:02:50] mind it was a finished work and you were
[1:02:52] sealed in the book before the foundation
[1:02:54] of the world you were on the marriage
[1:02:55] certificate before you ever realized it
[1:02:59] so it's not that I'm trying to do
[1:03:01] something to get my name on The Book of
[1:03:03] Life amen now I realize what he's done
[1:03:05] for me in my works as an appreciation
[1:03:08] for what he's done
[1:03:11] so then if that be the case
[1:03:14] I guess the way we live our life shows
[1:03:16] how much we appreciate God
[1:03:23] and you do these things just in
[1:03:24] appreciation common decency will tell
[1:03:27] you that you do those things in
[1:03:28] appreciation
[1:03:29] works is what I do for God if I never
[1:03:32] preach another sermon and live here 150
[1:03:34] years I'll still be saved sure I'm not
[1:03:37] saved because I'm a preacher I'm saved
[1:03:39] because it's God it's the grace of God
[1:03:41] that saved me there wasn't one thing I
[1:03:43] could do to Merit it
[1:03:47] so now it's not serving God for merit
[1:03:51] or for reward
[1:03:54] but I want to get down to the pure
[1:03:56] motive
[1:03:58] of appreciating him
[1:04:00] and I want him to know how much I
[1:04:03] appreciate him
[1:04:06] I'm not even talking about
[1:04:08] things that other people see
[1:04:11] because that's not what we're interested
[1:04:12] in anyways I'm not here to let you know
[1:04:15] how much I appreciate him
[1:04:17] because if I do that then I still want
[1:04:19] you to recognize me that's still selfish
[1:04:22] I mean that's how the Pharisees serve
[1:04:24] God they stood on the corners they
[1:04:26] brought in their phylacteries they gave
[1:04:27] loud prayers so that everyone and Jesus
[1:04:30] said they have the reward they got what
[1:04:31] they wanted
[1:04:32] I don't want to serve God to be
[1:04:34] appreciated by you
[1:04:36] I don't want to serve God to be
[1:04:37] recognized so that you'll say oh brother
[1:04:39] Chad he's a real Saint he's a real child
[1:04:41] of God Amen if that's the motive if I'm
[1:04:44] doing it for somebody else to see and
[1:04:46] acknowledge then I'm still doing it for
[1:04:48] me
[1:04:50] but what about the things nobody sees
[1:04:54] what about your private conversations
[1:04:56] the sacrifices you make that you don't
[1:04:58] blow a trumpet and talk about the times
[1:05:00] you keep quiet when you could have
[1:05:01] spoken the times when you turned when
[1:05:03] nobody knew you turned your head nobody
[1:05:05] knew you kept quiet amen only God knows
[1:05:08] what you did for him only God knows the
[1:05:11] extra time you spent in prayer only God
[1:05:13] knows how you've interceded for somebody
[1:05:15] who wanted to do you wrong only God sees
[1:05:18] that amen and it's a service to God and
[1:05:20] appreciation for him
[1:05:23] it's praising him and the quietness in
[1:05:26] my prayer closet and telling him how
[1:05:27] much I love him not for anybody else's
[1:05:30] ears to hear
[1:05:33] it's not not for show
[1:05:36] not to impress anybody but just to love
[1:05:39] God back
[1:05:42] brother Benham said in the message
[1:05:43] dedication he says you can see the
[1:05:45] Psalms how David is constant thinking of
[1:05:48] God
[1:05:49] too many of us today think of our own
[1:05:51] achievement something that we could do
[1:05:53] to better ourselves but David was
[1:05:55] constantly thinking what he could do for
[1:05:57] God
[1:05:59] I think that's amazing statement
[1:06:01] he was constantly he he got his house
[1:06:04] built and he was in peace all around and
[1:06:06] he said I live in a house of Cedar but
[1:06:07] the Ark dwelleth in the Tabernacle of
[1:06:10] curtains and he wanted to build a house
[1:06:12] for the Lord he was constantly thinking
[1:06:14] of what he could do for God when he
[1:06:16] failed he's he's crying out in Psalms 51
[1:06:19] he says oh Lord open now my lips and my
[1:06:22] mouth shall show forth praise for thou
[1:06:24] desire is not sacrifice else would I
[1:06:27] give it
[1:06:28] he's saying what can I give what can I
[1:06:31] give to repay what Can I Give
[1:06:34] he says doubt doesn't desire sacrifice
[1:06:36] else would I give it
[1:06:39] thou delightest non-burn offering the
[1:06:41] sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit
[1:06:43] are broken and a contrite heart oh God
[1:06:46] thou will not despise what was it God
[1:06:48] wanted God wanted a true repentant heart
[1:06:52] that was sorry for failing God
[1:06:55] not sorry I got caught sorry I'm in
[1:06:58] trouble but sorry that I failed God
[1:07:01] what did God want God wanted something
[1:07:04] that was real
[1:07:06] he wanted genuine worship real worship
[1:07:09] God wanted something real
[1:07:12] praise God
[1:07:14] let's look at Isaiah 29 together
[1:07:27] Isaiah 29.
[1:07:33] in verse 13.
[1:07:38] Isaiah 29 and 13.
[1:07:41] wherefore the Lord said for as much as
[1:07:43] his people draw near me with their mouth
[1:07:46] and with her lips to honor me but have
[1:07:49] removed their heart far from me and
[1:07:51] their fear toward me is taught by the
[1:07:53] precept of men
[1:07:55] God was not pleased with this
[1:07:58] what did he want and he wanted them to
[1:08:00] worship from their heart
[1:08:02] not
[1:08:04] by rules not by fear of man not by the
[1:08:08] the rule of the day not by the peer
[1:08:11] pressure or the group he wanted he
[1:08:13] wanted God wanted a man to love him back
[1:08:17] into worshiping
[1:08:20] again in the message God's gifts always
[1:08:23] find their places he said and I say that
[1:08:25] to us today the things that we bring to
[1:08:28] him identifies what our thoughts is
[1:08:30] about him
[1:08:31] I want you to pay close attention to
[1:08:33] this quote
[1:08:34] the the things that we bring to him
[1:08:38] the Christ identifies what our thoughts
[1:08:40] is about him
[1:08:42] you understand what I mean see if you
[1:08:45] believe it with all your heart every
[1:08:46] word of that you'll identify it by
[1:08:49] giving all that you have to it
[1:08:52] was he talking about he's talking about
[1:08:53] the word he's talking about the message
[1:08:55] now let's bring this home let's talk
[1:08:57] about Christ in our day the message of
[1:08:59] the hour
[1:09:01] he says what you what what you bring to
[1:09:05] him identifies your thoughts about him
[1:09:09] if you believe it with all your heart
[1:09:11] every word of that you identify it by
[1:09:14] giving all that you have to it
[1:09:17] if we believe that this message is the
[1:09:20] truth
[1:09:21] we'll give our whole life to it
[1:09:25] not part of our life not the religious
[1:09:28] section of our life for the church part
[1:09:29] of our life but we'll give all of our
[1:09:31] life to it our private life our thought
[1:09:34] life our family life our work life all
[1:09:37] of our life will give to this message
[1:09:40] if we believe it to be true
[1:09:42] and what we give amen indicates what we
[1:09:45] think about him
[1:09:47] because brother bear said this message
[1:09:49] is Christ amen it's not tapes it's not
[1:09:52] books it's not sermons by a man this
[1:09:55] message is Christ it's the identified
[1:09:58] Christ of this age
[1:10:00] and if we believe that then we'll
[1:10:03] automatically give our whole life to it
[1:10:06] amen it's an automatic response by
[1:10:08] believing it but if you find that
[1:10:10] there's a there's a there's a little
[1:10:12] hold back somewhere in life there's a
[1:10:14] little doubt about this being Christ
[1:10:18] it's just the truth
[1:10:20] he said he goes on to say but if you
[1:10:22] believe it's a good place to associate
[1:10:23] with better people
[1:10:25] I I I just marvel at this statement
[1:10:29] if you believe it's a good place to
[1:10:31] associate with better people around
[1:10:33] church and things like that that's just
[1:10:35] about what you give just a few social
[1:10:37] hours with some of the congregation or
[1:10:40] something
[1:10:41] but if you really believe it with all
[1:10:43] your heart then you'll give everything
[1:10:45] that's in you to it and it I it
[1:10:48] identifies you that you are truly
[1:10:50] believe the message that you believe it
[1:10:52] to be the truth
[1:10:54] if we're if we are message Believers in
[1:11:00] church Association
[1:11:02] then it shows what we believe about the
[1:11:05] message
[1:11:06] but if we believe that this is Christ
[1:11:09] Jesus
[1:11:10] then we'll give our whole life to it
[1:11:13] then it doesn't matter if there's
[1:11:15] anybody from the church around or not
[1:11:18] because I don't need anybody around from
[1:11:20] the church for me to serve God because I
[1:11:22] know what this message is
[1:11:24] I don't need other people Amen to
[1:11:26] support me I don't need somebody else to
[1:11:28] tell me if I'm right or wrong or I don't
[1:11:29] need to change my conduct whether
[1:11:31] somebody's watching or not
[1:11:34] because if that's if I'm changing my
[1:11:37] conduct whether somebody's watching or
[1:11:38] not then what's happening is I'm
[1:11:41] indicating what I believe about this
[1:11:44] message
[1:11:45] that it's a church thing
[1:11:48] that it's a group thing
[1:11:52] amen
[1:11:53] now trust me I'm not talking about being
[1:11:55] careful not to stumble a brother
[1:11:56] somebody has a conviction and you be
[1:11:58] careful and that's not your conviction
[1:11:59] I'm not talking about any of that I'm
[1:12:01] talking about actually conducting
[1:12:03] yourself differently in front of
[1:12:05] different people
[1:12:07] then you realize I have the wrong
[1:12:09] revelation of this message
[1:12:13] it's time to be I think it's just time
[1:12:15] to be real
[1:12:17] it's time to be honest with where we at
[1:12:19] and who we are and what we believe amen
[1:12:22] and if we find ourselves lacking say God
[1:12:24] Amen I believe help down my unbelief God
[1:12:28] I need a greater Revelation amen because
[1:12:30] I find in myself I want to give more I
[1:12:32] need to give more I need to see who you
[1:12:35] really are
[1:12:38] amen
[1:12:40] the Apostle Paul
[1:12:42] he was willing to give up everything
[1:12:43] because he believed the message of his
[1:12:45] day
[1:12:46] he gave up he he tells us in the book of
[1:12:49] Philippians amen I I if anybody has a
[1:12:52] right to boast I have a right to Gloria
[1:12:54] I'm of The Tribe of Benjamin a Pharisee
[1:12:56] of the Pharisees taught in the school
[1:12:58] and all of these things but he ends up
[1:13:00] saying I counted it all is done then I
[1:13:02] might win Christ
[1:13:03] I've given it all up because he's become
[1:13:06] my greatest treasure and he believed the
[1:13:08] pillar of fire he believed what Christ
[1:13:10] taught him and he proved it by giving
[1:13:13] his whole life to it Paul did not preach
[1:13:15] to become popular
[1:13:17] do you believe false reached for
[1:13:18] popularity do you believe he preached
[1:13:20] for money for power Paul preached
[1:13:22] because he loved God he preached this
[1:13:24] message because he loved loved God and
[1:13:27] brother Branham preached this message
[1:13:28] because he loved God he didn't do it for
[1:13:30] popularity he didn't do it for anything
[1:13:32] other than he loved God and in loving
[1:13:34] God he loved God's people and he served
[1:13:37] God by preaching this message
[1:13:39] he didn't do it for power he didn't do
[1:13:41] it for popularity he didn't do it for
[1:13:43] profit because he didn't get any of that
[1:13:47] but what did he do he gave his whole
[1:13:49] life and do you believe the prophet gave
[1:13:50] his whole life to this message he gave
[1:13:52] his whole life to this message he gave
[1:13:54] up his health his time his energy he
[1:13:57] gave it all to the word
[1:13:59] Paul did the same thing Moses did the
[1:14:01] same thing their conduct proved their
[1:14:03] faith
[1:14:05] and I want my conduct to prove my faith
[1:14:08] I want to be a genuine believer all the
[1:14:12] time and I want to give all my heart and
[1:14:14] all my life to this word
[1:14:16] and when I find myself distracted I want
[1:14:19] to repent say God forgive me for being
[1:14:20] distracted
[1:14:22] forgive me God for getting caught up in
[1:14:24] this little thing and caught up in that
[1:14:26] little thing and God I recognize that's
[1:14:28] not what I'm on this Earth for forgive
[1:14:30] me God and help me keep pressing
[1:14:33] amen that's what that's what I want to
[1:14:36] do that's what I want to give God I want
[1:14:38] to give myself to him
[1:14:40] it's the only gift that we can give is
[1:14:42] ourself and he's given us the free
[1:14:44] choice to make our choices amen and I
[1:14:47] want to choose him
[1:14:51] whether Ram goes on and God's gifts
[1:14:53] always find their places he says now
[1:14:55] notice
[1:14:57] now the same is now they rejected
[1:14:59] identified deity do you get it they will
[1:15:02] certainly put their name on a church
[1:15:03] book and say I'll try to live by this
[1:15:06] Creed they'll take an oath by this but
[1:15:08] when it comes to accepting deity and
[1:15:10] expressing back the same kind of gift
[1:15:12] that you are identified by your gift
[1:15:17] I I can't express this enough I don't
[1:15:19] know how to express it
[1:15:21] that you're identified by your gift
[1:15:24] you're saying well well I'm what are you
[1:15:26] what am I giving you're identified by
[1:15:28] your gift so if we're not giving all
[1:15:31] we're identified by our gift amen so
[1:15:34] what we're giving if we're giving to the
[1:15:36] one who is all we should give all and in
[1:15:39] giving all identifies what we think
[1:15:42] about the one we're giving to and it
[1:15:44] identifies us
[1:15:47] so you are identified by your gift the
[1:15:50] Magi were identified by their gift the
[1:15:52] the gift identified that they had a
[1:15:54] revelation of who this was in the manger
[1:15:57] their gift identified they knew the
[1:16:01] message they had the Revelation and what
[1:16:04] they gave identified what they believed
[1:16:08] and now what we give identifies what we
[1:16:12] believe if we give Sunday and Wednesday
[1:16:14] and some tithe and offering it I didn't
[1:16:17] that's it it identifies what we believe
[1:16:22] it identifies what we believe about who
[1:16:24] this is in our midst
[1:16:27] but if we give every day and we give our
[1:16:30] thoughts and we give our private time
[1:16:32] and we give the best of everything it
[1:16:34] identifies who what we think about who's
[1:16:37] in our midst and it identifies who we
[1:16:39] are that we are a genuine believer
[1:16:43] amen
[1:16:45] you are identified by your gift that you
[1:16:47] give that you that you give your entire
[1:16:50] being to it to identify deity
[1:16:54] what are we giving our our entire self
[1:16:57] to he said you give your entire being to
[1:17:00] identify deity
[1:17:03] what am I giving my entire being to
[1:17:06] a set of Doctrine
[1:17:08] some tapes
[1:17:09] no to identify deity this is identified
[1:17:13] the Mighty God
[1:17:15] this is this message is identified deity
[1:17:18] I'm not giving myself to a church
[1:17:21] program I'm not giving myself to a
[1:17:23] movement I'm not giving myself to a set
[1:17:25] of doctrines I am giving my whole being
[1:17:27] to identify deity and identify deity as
[1:17:31] worth of everything I've got
[1:17:33] and my gift identifies me
[1:17:38] then now this way says next then you
[1:17:41] identify yourself with the deity
[1:17:44] by giving all you are what you are to
[1:17:48] deity himself
[1:17:49] now Christ in this day that we now live
[1:17:51] in
[1:17:52] is is identifying himself deity among
[1:17:56] the people
[1:17:57] he's still deity because he is the word
[1:17:59] and when we see the word living itself
[1:18:01] then we know that man can't do that it's
[1:18:04] deity the word being made manifest by
[1:18:06] man and Jesus said himself the son can
[1:18:09] do nothing in himself I can't do nothing
[1:18:11] I'm a man Jesus said but my father that
[1:18:14] dwelleth in me he showeth me all things
[1:18:16] that himself doeth amen there you are
[1:18:18] what is it deity being identified in man
[1:18:22] now the same thing is today that deity
[1:18:25] the promised word for this day can
[1:18:28] identify itself in you
[1:18:32] then can you hold to it
[1:18:34] show that you believe in it give it
[1:18:37] deity believe it service and be ready to
[1:18:39] die out to yourself and your thoughts
[1:18:41] but today it's rejected as it was then
[1:18:44] this is identified deity in our midst
[1:18:47] but is it accepted
[1:18:49] as deity
[1:18:52] brother said in the message it is the
[1:18:54] rising of the Sun
[1:18:55] so is it today we don't try to be some
[1:18:58] big person
[1:19:00] we don't care what the people say about
[1:19:01] us our name ain't nothing but it's his
[1:19:04] name
[1:19:04] our life is nothing it's his life it's
[1:19:07] his power not our power and there's only
[1:19:10] one thing that we love to do is to see
[1:19:13] him glorified
[1:19:15] I believe with all my heart that's the
[1:19:16] way Paul lived
[1:19:18] I believe that's the way Moses lived and
[1:19:20] that's the way brother Branham lived
[1:19:22] is not to bring any attention to himself
[1:19:24] but to give his whole life to be to see
[1:19:26] Christ glorified
[1:19:28] and I think that's what we want
[1:19:31] is to give our whole life to see Christ
[1:19:33] glorified
[1:19:35] not our Glory his glory
[1:19:38] and how can it be when he's glorified in
[1:19:41] Us by his resurrection that's in US
[1:19:45] we see him represented again as he was
[1:19:47] today did you get that see our desire is
[1:19:50] not to be glorified our desire is not
[1:19:51] some big name our desire is not to boost
[1:19:53] some church or make more in Sunday
[1:19:55] school or try to bring in hogtie push in
[1:19:58] offer a picnic party or bring Stars
[1:20:00] buttons or something else like that
[1:20:02] that's not our desire our desire is to
[1:20:05] see him glorified glorified not with
[1:20:07] self-pride but in us our lives to prove
[1:20:10] he is alive in living in US
[1:20:13] so how is he going to be glorified when
[1:20:15] he's glorified in us how is he going to
[1:20:17] be glorified in us when we give him
[1:20:19] everything
[1:20:21] he can't be glorified if we're not
[1:20:23] giving him everything but if we give and
[1:20:24] yield everything to him and surrender
[1:20:27] everything to the word then the word can
[1:20:29] live in us and then deity can be
[1:20:30] glorified in us and we live not so that
[1:20:33] we are glorified so that he's glorified
[1:20:35] in US
[1:20:37] [Music]
[1:20:38] so we have to get rid of us so that he
[1:20:41] can come in us so that he can be
[1:20:42] glorified in US
[1:20:44] not us him
[1:20:46] in US how's it going to happen when I
[1:20:49] give him everything
[1:20:52] listen what he says next if I can get
[1:20:54] myself out of the way
[1:20:55] so when William Branham not even thought
[1:20:57] of and you're not even thought of until
[1:20:59] we can see Jesus glorified among us see
[1:21:02] him that's our desire
[1:21:10] and now this is the last quote that I
[1:21:11] want to read God's gifts find their
[1:21:13] place
[1:21:15] he says tonight
[1:21:17] let me take him as my savior to my heart
[1:21:22] let me walk in the face of my death or
[1:21:24] whatever it is like that I promised my
[1:21:28] life to him
[1:21:29] I want to take it to him
[1:21:32] programs makes a statement when he's
[1:21:34] talking about the little on the
[1:21:35] street remember from Sunday little
[1:21:37] on the street he wanted to buy his
[1:21:39] little daughter a doll she cried for a
[1:21:41] doll and she died and he wanted to take
[1:21:43] that doll to her and he walked the
[1:21:45] streets with his little doll in his
[1:21:46] heart and he wanted to get it to her and
[1:21:47] the only way he could get it to her was
[1:21:49] to die
[1:21:51] and God wanted to get a gift to us and
[1:21:53] the only way he could get it was for him
[1:21:54] to die
[1:21:56] but now we want to give a gift back to
[1:21:59] him and the only way to give it to him
[1:22:01] is to die
[1:22:03] it's the same thing all over again he
[1:22:06] died to bring a gift to us now I want to
[1:22:08] give a gift back to him but the only way
[1:22:10] that I can give this gift to him is I
[1:22:13] must die to self and if I die I can get
[1:22:15] the gift through
[1:22:20] he said I promised my life to him I want
[1:22:22] to take it to him no matter what I have
[1:22:25] to go if I have to go through death if I
[1:22:28] have to be shot no matter what it takes
[1:22:30] takes place if I have to be laughed at
[1:22:32] called crazy everything s communicated
[1:22:34] from the rest of the Christian churches
[1:22:36] and so forth it's a gift of God that I
[1:22:38] hold in my heart he gave it I want to
[1:22:41] take it to him
[1:22:42] what is it it's the seed of Faith it's
[1:22:44] the life that he's planted inside of me
[1:22:46] and he's quick and amen by his holy
[1:22:49] spirit coming inside and there's a gift
[1:22:51] that he placed in me that I want to give
[1:22:53] back to him but I can only take it to
[1:22:55] him if I die
[1:22:58] I said God help me to die and to give
[1:23:02] everything to you
[1:23:04] it's not this isn't this isn't a message
[1:23:07] that we're preaching to to try to get
[1:23:08] somebody to shape up or make you pay
[1:23:10] tithes or make you come to church more
[1:23:13] often amen that's inconsequential amen I
[1:23:16] mean it matters it does matter but you
[1:23:18] can come to church every service and pay
[1:23:19] all your tithes and be as lost as lost
[1:23:21] can be amen this is a message for all of
[1:23:23] us to say I want to Fan those flames of
[1:23:26] that desire that's inside of me and I
[1:23:28] want to rekindle that desire to give him
[1:23:30] everything because that's the only way
[1:23:32] that he can be glorified in this day is
[1:23:34] when he's glorified in his bride
[1:23:37] and if that bride is giving partial and
[1:23:39] holding back some and still with selfish
[1:23:42] desires and wants to be glorified and
[1:23:44] known as being spiritual or known as
[1:23:46] being righteous and she has all of these
[1:23:48] things going on Amen he's not going to
[1:23:50] be glorified he'll be the deity amongst
[1:23:53] us that's rejected
[1:23:55] why because of self
[1:23:57] this isn't about a church anymore this
[1:24:00] is about me as an individual is he
[1:24:03] welcome here amen is he come to my house
[1:24:06] and my invitation and is he going to sit
[1:24:08] here with unwashed feet or am I going to
[1:24:10] be like the little Harlot when he comes
[1:24:12] into this house will I sell out all to
[1:24:15] give him the best offering that I have
[1:24:18] I want to be the one who gives all
[1:24:21] I want to be the one
[1:24:24] promised in my life and I want to take
[1:24:26] it to him
[1:24:27] but I've got to pass through the doors
[1:24:29] of death to self
[1:24:32] and unfortunately that's not a one-time
[1:24:35] event
[1:24:37] I wish that I could die to myself once
[1:24:40] and then I got it over with
[1:24:42] go to the chopping block of self-will
[1:24:44] and have my head caught off but it's
[1:24:47] dying daily
[1:24:49] Paul said I Die daily
[1:24:52] and I want to Die daily to keep giving
[1:24:55] this gift to him
[1:24:58] willingly out of a desire out of my
[1:25:00] heart
[1:25:01] willingly because that's what I want
[1:25:03] more than anything is to see him
[1:25:06] glorified
[1:25:07] Cain and Abel were going to bring an
[1:25:09] offering
[1:25:11] Cain was going to bring a gift to God an
[1:25:13] offering to God Abel was going to bring
[1:25:15] an offering to God
[1:25:17] so Cain through self-will worship he
[1:25:20] gave God what he thought God wanted
[1:25:23] and what he gave looked nice and what he
[1:25:25] gave made Cain look nice because Cain
[1:25:28] brought a beautiful offering you know
[1:25:30] the beautiful offering made the one
[1:25:31] offering it look beautiful
[1:25:34] there's so many things when we get down
[1:25:36] to the heart of it there's so many
[1:25:37] things that we as human beings do to
[1:25:40] make us look good
[1:25:43] Cain his offering made Cain look good
[1:25:48] Abel was going to give a different kind
[1:25:51] of offering
[1:25:53] he was going to give an offering that
[1:25:55] pleased God
[1:25:58] and the only way to give an offering
[1:26:00] that would please God is he would have
[1:26:02] to die to everything he thought about
[1:26:05] what God wanted
[1:26:06] and wait for God to tell him what he
[1:26:09] wanted reveal it by Revelation and then
[1:26:12] just give God what God wanted
[1:26:16] with nothing extra
[1:26:18] when nothing lasts with nothing more but
[1:26:20] just to give God what he wanted but
[1:26:23] listen we're back in the same place
[1:26:25] today oh my goodness there's religious
[1:26:27] Spirits floating around all over the
[1:26:29] place amen and they're all around you
[1:26:31] and I amen so don't think they're
[1:26:32] somewhere else amen we can keep giving
[1:26:34] what makes us look good and look like
[1:26:36] Believers and say the right thing and
[1:26:38] look good or we can say I want to bring
[1:26:41] an offering by a genuine Revelation
[1:26:43] because I know who this is in this hour
[1:26:47] because he's revealed to me what he
[1:26:49] wants and what he wants is my life not
[1:26:51] my not just my money not just some time
[1:26:54] on Sunday and Wednesday he wants me
[1:26:57] because that's the plan and this day is
[1:27:00] to live in people
[1:27:03] so what does he want not a few hours a
[1:27:06] couple times a week a few dollars that
[1:27:09] come out of a paycheck that's not what
[1:27:11] he wants what does he want it's a
[1:27:13] revelation of what's going on in this
[1:27:15] day is going to require amen what we
[1:27:18] give indicates what we believe out of
[1:27:20] this message
[1:27:21] if I believe that this message is what
[1:27:24] God did through William Branham then I'm
[1:27:26] going to keep talking about what God did
[1:27:27] and how wonderful it was and all the
[1:27:29] wonderful things and I believe in the
[1:27:31] prophet and I'll keep living for self
[1:27:33] thinking everything's fine but what God
[1:27:35] wants in this day he got what he wanted
[1:27:37] in that day but what he wants in this
[1:27:39] day is a bride that he can pour himself
[1:27:41] completely into and she will be so much
[1:27:44] like him she will be him
[1:27:46] that's the that's the revelation of this
[1:27:49] hour Christ in you the hope of glory and
[1:27:52] you don't get there with a partial with
[1:27:54] a halfway with holding back for self
[1:27:58] so when it comes down to it amen
[1:28:01] when it comes down to it
[1:28:03] we've got to look at our lives and say
[1:28:05] what do I believe about this message
[1:28:10] and does my gift
[1:28:13] match my revelation
[1:28:18] it's a good question to ask ourselves
[1:28:21] and say Lord
[1:28:23] help me
[1:28:25] help me God
[1:28:27] give me eyes to see give me a heart to
[1:28:30] perceive all that you're doing in this
[1:28:33] hour and Lord let me die to my own
[1:28:36] self-will and self-designed and help me
[1:28:38] get my gift through to you
[1:28:40] by carrying it in my heart and dying
[1:28:43] to self
[1:28:44] to bring this gift
[1:28:46] is that your desire
[1:28:48] but would you stand with me
[1:28:51] I know it's your desire
[1:28:54] I know what you desire that's why
[1:28:55] there's no there's no desire in me to go
[1:28:59] through a million examples and and show
[1:29:01] how all the ways that we found we know
[1:29:03] how we fail not the brow beater cause
[1:29:05] you to look bad or or make everybody
[1:29:08] raise your hand if you failed this week
[1:29:10] it's a hundred percent participation in
[1:29:12] the hand raised
[1:29:14] I don't want any of that
[1:29:16] but what I want to do is keep preaching
[1:29:18] this gospel so that it inspires us to
[1:29:21] keep pressing on to keep dying out to
[1:29:23] keep giving more because it's the only
[1:29:25] thing that'll work in this day is a 100
[1:29:27] sell out to the pure revelation of the
[1:29:30] world
[1:29:31] no partial is going to work anymore
[1:29:34] it's going to take everything but it's
[1:29:36] not going to take everything by coercion
[1:29:38] it's not going to take everything by a
[1:29:39] strong personality or dominance it's
[1:29:42] going to come by a free will offering
[1:29:46] what does God want for this Tabernacle
[1:29:49] for him to dwell in he wants us to give
[1:29:51] everything he's given to us which is our
[1:29:54] life
[1:29:55] to give back to him in a free will
[1:29:57] offering
[1:29:59] what did you do to give yourself life
[1:30:01] both natural and eternal
[1:30:03] nothing
[1:30:05] he's spoiled Egypt
[1:30:08] to give you life
[1:30:11] now he's asking for you to give that
[1:30:14] life back to him
[1:30:15] but only those whose Hearts stir them
[1:30:19] to give an offering willingly
[1:30:22] not by Church order not by Church rule
[1:30:25] not by preaching the message so hard
[1:30:28] that you're scared to death to do
[1:30:30] something wrong
[1:30:32] I don't want you to be scared at all
[1:30:35] I don't want you to be one ounce fearful
[1:30:39] I want I want there to be an atmosphere
[1:30:41] where everybody has the freedom to
[1:30:43] express what's the deepest desire of
[1:30:45] their heart
[1:30:46] and that's what I want to come out
[1:30:49] if that's what comes out
[1:30:52] there'll be more than enough
[1:30:56] there'll be more than enough there'll be
[1:31:00] everything God needs
[1:31:01] to finish the work in this day
[1:31:04] I want to give him all because I want to
[1:31:08] give him all
[1:31:11] I want to show my appreciation for him
[1:31:13] by dying to myself I want to either die
[1:31:17] to myself today I want to die to myself
[1:31:19] tomorrow
[1:31:20] and I want to keep dying to myself and
[1:31:23] keep surrendering more and more
[1:31:26] what can you give somebody who made it
[1:31:28] all
[1:31:29] who created the heavens and the Earth
[1:31:31] and has everything
[1:31:34] just give it's not so much what you give
[1:31:37] but how you give
[1:31:40] how did the two mites please the Lord
[1:31:43] how did the alabaster box appointment
[1:31:46] please the Lord how did Abel's offering
[1:31:48] please the Lord how will your offering
[1:31:51] please the Lord
[1:31:52] is when you give willingly from a
[1:31:55] willing Heart by Revelation and you
[1:31:59] surrender to his desire for this hour
[1:32:03] say God help us all
[1:32:05] men are musicians if you'd come please
[1:32:09] let's bow our heads together
[1:32:12] oh Lord Jesus
[1:32:14] God I've poured out what you put in my
[1:32:16] Heart Lord
[1:32:18] God no doubt
[1:32:21] that the human element keeps it
[1:32:23] insufficient
[1:32:25] I'm not able to express all that's in my
[1:32:27] heart but Lord there's a supernatural
[1:32:29] element at work
[1:32:31] and by that Supernatural element of your
[1:32:34] spirit through the foolishness of
[1:32:35] preaching
[1:32:36] do heart surgery in US Lord now
[1:32:39] go down into the crevices and the nooks
[1:32:42] and crannies of our hearts Lord and
[1:32:44] expose those places where we have to die
[1:32:47] help us Lord to have our desire to give
[1:32:50] willingly of our whole selves
[1:32:52] God do the work that only your word Can
[1:32:55] Do Lord no human can do it no human
[1:32:57] effort can do it but God you have a
[1:33:00] power that's here it's the power of your
[1:33:02] word you've opened the word to us in
[1:33:04] this hour to change everything
[1:33:07] God help us to give more of ourselves
[1:33:10] than we've ever given before
[1:33:12] and father I ask that you forgive me
[1:33:14] Lord
[1:33:15] forgive me for the distractions forgive
[1:33:18] me Lord for the for the foolishness that
[1:33:21] I allow sometimes
[1:33:23] forgive me for the waste of time and the
[1:33:25] waste of energy I'm sorry Lord
[1:33:29] but I pray God as I surrender to you I
[1:33:31] pray God you would help me
[1:33:34] give me more I save that I can see more
[1:33:37] clearly
[1:33:38] that I might yield in a greater way and
[1:33:40] that you can do things through a yielded
[1:33:42] vessel that I never could imagine and I
[1:33:45] have no strength for on my own but Lord
[1:33:47] may you declare your deity and flesh
[1:33:49] through a surrendered vessel
[1:33:51] and may it be for your glory and for
[1:33:54] yours alone
[1:33:55] while we give ourselves to you afresh
[1:33:58] we ask that you'd have your way bless
[1:34:00] your people Lord
[1:34:02] May the word that you've given us today
[1:34:05] may have hit home Lord
[1:34:07] May It Strike the court it was intended
[1:34:09] to strike man go to the place you
[1:34:11] intended for it to go
[1:34:13] and May It Go like a seed in good ground
[1:34:15] and may it bring forth a Bountiful
[1:34:17] Harvest
[1:34:18] for God you alone know why you do things
[1:34:21] the way you do you know why you have
[1:34:23] things said the way they're said
[1:34:25] and I'm completely trusting in you Lord
[1:34:27] to do the work
[1:34:29] God and our little Minds we can't
[1:34:31] comprehend but Lord we trust you
[1:34:34] God do a work in each one of us
[1:34:37] Lord let us bring an offering that's
[1:34:39] pleasing to you
[1:34:40] acceptable in your sight a free will
[1:34:43] offering of our desire to please you
[1:34:47] we love you Lord we ask your blessing
[1:34:49] over us as we go guide our Steps step by
[1:34:53] step Lord as we lift our feet may you
[1:34:55] put them down in the very center of your
[1:34:57] will
[1:34:58] May every step we take in every path we
[1:35:00] walk May It Be Your choosing May It Be
[1:35:03] by your leading and may you get glory in
