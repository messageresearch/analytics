[11:11] again on a Wednesday night that you've

[11:17] pray that you would just bless us now as
[11:19] we hear your word may we hear them with
[11:22] more than natural ears but may there be
[11:24] ears of hearing that are deep in our
[11:26] soul and may you open those ears and
[11:28] open our
[11:29] understanding that we might gain a
[11:31] revelation upon this word that we might
[11:34] see you Lord more than with more clarity
[11:37] than we ever have before we might see
[11:38] our day and our age and our position in
[11:41] you Lord help us I pray bless us in all
[11:44] we say and do and all that we hear this

[11:52] that we need of for this life we love

[12:18] an electronic version we'll also have
[12:20] the words on the overhead so you can
[12:21] follow along on those as
[12:24] well um just wanted to uh remind you
[12:28] that brother Ron Garvin and brother John
[12:30] Brooks are still traveling they're
[12:33] almost hitting the midsection of their
[12:35] trip so they've got quite a long trip
[12:36] and they've still got quite a lot of
[12:38] ground to cover I checked in with both
[12:40] of them today and they're both doing
[12:41] good they're feeling healthy and they've
[12:43] done well so just remember them in
[12:45] prayer and remember their family as well

[12:50] Brother Kyle wer he'll be traveling he

[12:53] Oregon to minister for Brother Rich Cobb
[12:56] this weekend so I know that he would
[12:58] appreciate your prayers
[12:59] as well and then brother um I spoke with
[13:04] um brother Gabe Smith and he made it
[13:06] back he made it back safely from this
[13:08] past week in ministering for Brother
[13:09] John and he was going to come to church
[13:11] this evening but started feeling unwell
[13:13] just before he came so we want to
[13:14] remember brother Gabe as well in our
[13:17] prayers amen but he had a good trip he
[13:19] said it was he had a good time and had
[13:21] good
[13:22] Services man uh as we go into um the
[13:26] service can you pull up the PowerPoint
[13:27] brother Franco as as we go into the book
[13:30] we listen to the first section last
[13:32] Wednesday we'll listen to part two
[13:34] another section of it this Wednesday and
[13:35] then we'll have next Wednesday to finish
[13:37] it Lord
[13:39] willing I want to uh I want to do a a
[13:43] little review uh but first let's stand
[13:47] together and read the opening scripture
[13:48] I want us to be reminded of the
[13:50] scripture that brother random opened
[13:52] with sometimes when we break it into
[13:53] sections we forget the scripture that he
[13:56] opened with and I want to keep that top
[13:57] of mind and remember we're going into is
[14:00] your life worthy of the Gospel that's
[14:02] the that's the title we want to hold
[14:03] that in our minds that's what brother
[14:05] B's talking about and that's what he's
[14:06] trying to show us is your life worthy of
[14:09] the gospel and he's trying to show us
[14:10] what what a life worthy of the Gospel is
[14:13] and what a life not worthy of the Gospel
[14:15] is and if you remember last time when we
[14:17] looked at it we found out it wasn't a
[14:19] life that had everything right and all
[14:21] their ducks in a row and always did
[14:22] everything perfect but a life that was
[14:24] worthy of the Gospel is someone who
[14:27] received the gospel for their age when
[14:28] it was presented to them and somebody
[14:30] who was not worthy of the Gospel was
[14:32] somebody who rejected the word when it
[14:35] came to them in their day and age and so
[14:37] it was much simpler than we thought amen
[14:40] very very simple so let's look at uh
[14:42] Luke chapter
[14:44] 14 this is the opening scripture brother
[14:46] renham opened with and read to the
[14:49] congregation Luke chap
[14:53] 14 and we'll begin with uh verse 16
[14:59] then said he unto him a certain man made
[15:01] a great supper and bade many and sent
[15:04] his servant at supper time to say to
[15:06] them that were bid come for all things
[15:08] are now ready and they all with one
[15:11] consent began to make excuse the first
[15:14] said unto him I have bought a piece of
[15:16] ground and I must needs go and see it I
[15:18] pray thee have me
[15:19] excused and another said I have bought
[15:22] five Yol of oxen and I go to prove them
[15:24] I pray that you have me excused and
[15:26] another said I have married a wife and
[15:28] therefore I cannot come so that servant
[15:31] came and showed his Lord these things
[15:33] then the master of the house being angry
[15:35] said to his servant go out quickly into
[15:37] the streets and the lanes of the city
[15:39] and bring in hither the poor and the
[15:41] maimed and the Halt and the Blind and
[15:44] the servant said Lord it is done as thou
[15:46] Hast commanded and yet there is room and
[15:48] the Lord said unto the servant go into
[15:50] the highways and hedges and compel them
[15:52] to come in that my house may be filled
[15:55] for I say unto you that none of those
[15:57] men which were and shall taste of my
[16:00] supper let's turn from there back to
[16:02] Matthew
[16:04] 22 Matthew 22 isn't a scripture brother
[16:07] bham read but he referred to it and told
[16:08] the people to read it
[16:10] later but he refers to it a couple times
[16:13] so let's look at Matthew
[16:15] 22 and we'll begin at verse
[16:18] one Matthew 22 and
[16:20] 1 and Jesus answered and spake unto them
[16:23] again by Parables and said the Kingdom
[16:25] of Heaven is like unto a certain King
[16:28] which made a marriage for his son and
[16:30] sent forth his servants to call them
[16:32] that were bidden to the wedding and they
[16:35] would not come again he sent forth other
[16:37] servants saying tell them which are
[16:39] bidden behold I have prepared my dinner
[16:41] my oxen and my fatlings are killed and
[16:44] all things are ready come into the
[16:46] marriage but they made light of it and
[16:48] went their way and one to his farm
[16:51] another to his merchandise and the
[16:53] remnant took his servants and entreated
[16:55] them spitefully and slew them but when
[16:58] the king heard thereof he was wroth and
[17:00] he sent forth his armies and destroyed
[17:02] those murderers and burned up their City
[17:04] then said he to his servants the wedding
[17:06] is ready but they which were bidden were
[17:09] not worthy this is where brother Brenham
[17:11] gets his title those who were bidden
[17:13] were not worthy go ye therefore into the
[17:16] highways and as many as you shall find
[17:18] bid to the marriage so those servants
[17:21] went out into the highways and gathered
[17:23] together all as many as they found both
[17:25] bad and good and the wedding was
[17:27] furnished with guest that's where we
[17:30] read this at the end of the last service
[17:32] and we realized that the the wedding was
[17:36] furnished with both bad and good as many
[17:40] as would heed the call so praise God I'm
[17:43] one of those bad ones that got invited
[17:45] to the wedding and I heeded the call
[17:47] praise be to God so we can see this is
[17:50] not something worthy of the Gospel it's
[17:51] not something based on perfect conduct
[17:55] it's based on an ability to receive the
[17:57] invitation and respond to the invitation
[18:00] amen you can have your
[18:04] seats if you'll take your book uh your
[18:07] book or if you have the electronic
[18:08] version if you'll open that up I want to
[18:10] just highlight a few things as we move
[18:13] on um if we go to
[18:16] page in the book we go to page 36 at the
[18:19] bottom of page nine I'm sorry paragraph
[18:21] 36 at the bottom of page
[18:24] nine and read a couple things that
[18:27] brother bam said said now we see when
[18:30] God gives a man an invitation and to do
[18:32] something or to receive the invitation
[18:34] that he gives him and he and he returns
[18:36] it down then there's nothing left after
[18:38] Mercy is spurned but judgment if you
[18:41] step over the boundaries of Mercy
[18:43] there's only one thing left and that is
[18:45] judgment and we find that man has done
[18:48] that in all ages it's happened most
[18:50] every age in the Bible we turn to the
[18:53] next page and go to the bottom of page
[18:57] 11 brother B said America 15 years ago
[19:00] when the Great healing Revival continued
[19:02] on from Pentecost broke out in the
[19:04] nation and there was revivals in the
[19:06] capital Washington DC the presidents
[19:09] vice presidents great people Governors
[19:11] great things taking place Governors and
[19:14] men were healed like Congressman Upshaw
[19:16] and been a crippled for 66 years and
[19:19] they could not turn their face and say
[19:20] it wasn't so it was right before them
[19:23] but they turned it down and tonight
[19:25] that's the reason this nation stays she
[19:27] is doomed there is no hope for it at all
[19:30] she has crossed the line between
[19:31] judgment and mercy and she's elected in
[19:34] what she has here to control the nation
[19:36] so that he's speaking of John F Kennedy
[19:38] so he shows that the nation is doomed
[19:40] why is the nation doomed not because of
[19:43] the immorality not because of the
[19:45] decision those all came secondarily they
[19:48] were doomed when they turned down the
[19:49] invitation then all these things
[19:51] followed so you can say this nation is
[19:53] doomed it's finished because of uh uh of
[19:56] transgenderism because of immoral ity
[19:59] because of all of that no they're doomed
[20:01] this nation is doomed because it refused
[20:03] the invitation and when it refused the
[20:05] invitation it separated itself from the
[20:08] presence of God and then immorality and
[20:10] divorce and remarriage and all these
[20:12] things came in afterwards so it's really
[20:15] important let's go down to um uh let's
[20:19] go to page
[20:24] 14 paragraph 59 at the
[20:27] top some some kind something some kind
[20:30] of excuse it's too hot I'm too tired I
[20:32] will tomorrow just some kind of an
[20:34] excuse that's all they do by rejecting
[20:37] the day of visitation it separates you
[20:39] from God that's why the churches fail
[20:43] the Nations fail people fail it's
[20:45] because they rejected the invitation and
[20:47] separated themselves from God and then
[20:49] all these other things come
[20:52] behind let's turn together to page 21
[21:01] this is where we stopped last
[21:04] time and we're going to go into the
[21:06] questions here in a minute but we're
[21:07] going to read from the beginning of um
[21:10] paragraph 108 here on page 21 all the
[21:14] way to the top of page uh 41 today and
[21:17] that'll be the section we go through now
[21:19] so if you want to get out your pen and
[21:20] your paper and jot down these questions
[21:22] we'll go ahead and go through the
[21:23] questions and uh these questions will be
[21:26] answered throughout the service
[21:30] today first question a Christian cannot
[21:34] be a Christian until
[21:35] what and you as I said before sometimes
[21:38] these questions are worded a little
[21:39] funny but they're worded funny because
[21:41] of the way brother bam says something so
[21:43] it's worded in light of the way he
[21:44] addresses an issue and in in every
[21:49] question if we just take it the grand
[21:50] scheme of things could have many many
[21:52] different answers but that's not what
[21:53] we're looking for we're looking for how
[21:55] he addresses it in this in this sermon
[21:58] here
[21:59] a Christian cannot be a Christian until
[22:04] what what will produce relationship with
[22:12] God what will produce relationship with
[22:19] God what is one thing to know that
[22:22] you're a
[22:26] Christian what is one thing to know that
[22:30] you're a
[22:34] Christian and the last question this
[22:36] evening will be what creates an
[22:38] atmosphere around us so before we start
[22:42] the tape we'll give you just a second to
[22:44] jot those
[22:55] down this is where speed writing comes
[22:57] in handy
[23:09] shorthand all right if you're done with
[23:11] the questions you can turn to page
[23:13] 21 we'll begin at paragraph 108 here in
[23:17] the middle of page 21 brother Franco if
[23:21] you want to go ahead and queue up the
[23:23] audio and start playing it now thank you
[23:31] I had a little something that happened
[23:32] in Mexico not long ago General valinia
[23:36] elected of God the light shined across
[23:39] his path once in one of the meetings
[23:41] that great Catholic Warrior one of the
[23:43] highest Generals in Mexico come humbly
[23:46] to The Altar and receive the baptism of
[23:47] the Holy Ghost he went back down in
[23:50] Mexico he kept crying to me come down
[23:52] there finally out to decided to go down
[23:54] the Lord led me had a vision told my
[23:56] wife went down there and what he did him
[23:58] being one of their Chief generals
[23:59] fourstar General he went to the
[24:01] headquarters of the government and they
[24:03] they're hard against Protestants down
[24:04] there you know so they know this going
[24:06] to be a terrific meeting so he went down
[24:08] there and got a militia guard and when
[24:10] they did they got the big arena and they
[24:13] was going to bring me in like that the
[24:15] government was bringing in so when they
[24:17] did the the bishop one of the great
[24:21] Bishops of the Catholic Church went up
[24:23] to him to the governor and said sir I
[24:26] understand that you're bringing in a non
[24:28] Catholic he said yes what about it why
[24:32] he said you can't have a man like that
[24:34] in here this government has never know
[24:36] to doing a thing like that but said
[24:37] we've done it now he said well I said
[24:40] the man's a reputable man I understand
[24:42] it thousands of people comes out to hear

[28:56] nose of the people here what's that
[28:58] thing for a thing to play the Protestant

[29:02] something man the real works of the Lord
[29:04] was perfectly Vindicated proed there
[29:06] Daron to touch of paper with it there
[29:09] you are they received an invitation and
[29:12] turned it down yes sir they can't
[29:15] understand how a simple message a simple
[29:17] people to reject a thing like that would
[29:20] cause them to go into chaos a woman said
[29:24] to me Grand Pastor Oregon sometime ago
[29:26] Catholic girl come out there to condemn
[29:28] and right up the newspaper report a pack
[29:30] of cigarettes in her hand and she said I
[29:33] want to talk to you I said what does she
[29:35] want to say she said I want to ask you
[29:37] some questions about this religion of
[29:38] yours and I said what is it you want to
[29:41] ask and she said by what Authority you
[29:43] do this I said in the name of Jesus
[29:45] Christ by a Divine call and she went
[29:47] ahead smart off I said just a minute she
[29:50] said if I had to associate with that
[29:51] bunch of ignoramuses up there she said I
[29:53] wouldn't even want to be a Christian she
[29:55] said and if them they say that them
[29:57] people are rule the Earth someday she
[29:59] said I hope I'm not here I said don't
[30:01] worry you won't be I said you have to
[30:03] worry about that well she said all that
[30:06] there carrying on and screaming I said
[30:08] and you claim to be a Catholic she said
[30:10] I am I said did you know the Blessed
[30:13] Virgin Mary had to receive the Holy
[30:14] Ghost and speak in tongues and dance in
[30:16] the spirit the same way they did before
[30:17] God a receive her you call her the
[30:19] mother of God she said that's nonsense
[30:21] that I just a minute uh how am I
[30:23] supposed to look at the Bible I said
[30:24] then how you going to know what's truth
[30:26] or not she said I take my church word I
[30:28] said this is God's word here it is right
[30:30] here I'll challenge you to look at it
[30:33] and Mary was with them up there in the
[30:34] upper room and receiv received a baptism
[30:35] of the Holy Ghost after and you call her
[30:38] the mother of God the Lord I said then
[30:40] call that bunch of trash backwash I said
[30:42] don't worry you won't be there you don't
[30:44] have much to worry about if that's all
[30:46] you got to worry about you better worry
[30:48] about your own sinful Soul girl and I
[30:51] let her go now think of all this a
[30:55] simple God makes it so simple how could
[30:58] Ahab how could
[31:01] Jezebel how could those people who
[31:03] thought that Elijah was a
[31:06] witch thought he was a spiritualist even
[31:09] Ahab said here's the one that's caused
[31:11] all this trouble to Israel he said
[31:14] you're the ones troubled
[31:16] Israel how could that Nation think that
[31:19] to reject the message of a fuzzy face
[31:22] man like that no Priestly garments on
[31:24] and so forth would be the condemnation
[31:27] of
[31:29] how could Egypt that rule the world
[31:32] pharaohs and his class and dignity the
[31:35] world has never come to that place again
[31:37] and Science and so forth how could they
[31:40] think to reject an old prophet of 80
[31:44] years old with Whiskers hanging down
[31:47] gray hair stomping out of there a
[31:50] fugitive and come out there with a
[31:52] message you'll either let them go or God
[31:55] will destroy the nation amen how could
[31:58] Pharaoh you obey me Pharaoh Pharaoh said
[32:02] obey oh him
[32:04] pharaoh and an old man some old Crank
[32:08] that all turn her God down like that
[32:10] destroy is but it did
[32:12] it oh my let's stop pause a few minutes
[32:16] and have a prayer and think what day are
[32:19] we living in where are we at in another
[32:23] modern scientific age we better think
[32:26] maybe you stop people stop pray a little
[32:28] while and think a little bit you feel
[32:30] better you have to get through doing it
[32:32] that's right a Christian is not a tool
[32:35] or some kind of a mechanical wrench to a
[32:37] great big religious regime that's right
[32:41] a Christian is not some kind of tool
[32:43] that keeps a religious organization
[32:45] moving a Christian that is not a
[32:48] Christian a Christian is to be
[32:51] Christlike and a Christian cannot be a
[32:54] Christian until Christ comes into the
[32:56] man the life of Christ in him then it
[32:59] produces the life that Christ lived and
[33:01] you do the things that Christ
[33:05] did what am I talking about personal
[33:08] relationship to Christ what is it is
[33:12] your life worthy of the Gospel now I'm
[33:16] trying to lay that background there to
[33:18] show you that man and women who will
[33:20] renown women man the Bible said did you
[33:23] notice last Sunday night something I
[33:25] forgot to put in Genesis sixth chapter
[33:28] and the fourth verse those men who taken
[33:31] to them women for wives were a man of
[33:33] old
[33:35] Renown renowned man predicted to come
[33:39] again like it was in the days of Noah so
[33:41] will it be in the coming of the son of
[33:43] man renowned man taking women not wives
[33:48] women going after strange flesh look in
[33:51] England a couple weeks ago look in the
[33:53] united look everywhere it's full of
[33:56] prostitution great man
[33:58] great High offices bringing disgrace
[34:01] upon the Nations running after
[34:04] women that great man there in England
[34:07] some kind of a warlord like why' you
[34:09] notice he had a pretty wife her picture
[34:12] was there long look at that Russian
[34:16] prostitute but she's all sexy dressed
[34:19] and throw herself out there to display
[34:21] her female flesh and the man fell
[34:24] apart what we need today is sons of God
[34:27] God we need man in government that's
[34:30] sons of God that's right therefore a
[34:34] good Godly king would stop all this
[34:36] nonsense there wouldn't be no strings to
[34:38] pull like David did he put a stop to it
[34:42] certainly did because he was a king and
[34:45] there was only the real way is God being
[34:49] the king and God sends a prophet didn't
[34:52] Samuel tell them before they ever got a
[34:54] king he said God's your king have I ever
[34:57] told you anything in the name of the
[34:59] Lord but what come to pass they said no
[35:00] that's right have I ever bummed you for
[35:03] your living no you never did bum us for
[35:05] a living I've never told you enough but
[35:07] what was right before the Lord said God
[35:09] is your
[35:11] king oh we realize that we know you're a
[35:14] good man Samuel we believe the word of
[35:15] the Lord comes to you but we want a king
[35:17] anyhow that's what they get Pentecost
[35:20] want an organization anyhow you got it
[35:23] that's right want to be like the rest of
[35:25] the churches you are go ahead that
[35:28] that's just why it takes but God is our
[35:30] King God is our king that's what is it
[35:35] is because that the people like they did
[35:37] in the days of Christ like they have in
[35:40] every age they find an
[35:44] excuse they have their own Creeds you
[35:46] might not want to say I I bought a cow
[35:48] and I got to go see where she she work
[35:51] or not or give milk or what stock she is
[35:54] you might not have that excuse but
[35:56] here's the kind of excuse that people
[35:57] make say I'm a presbyterian we don't
[36:00] believe in that I'm Baptist we don't
[36:03] believe in no such stuff as that well
[36:05] I'm a
[36:06] Lutheran well that don't have anything
[36:08] to do with it that don't mean you're
[36:10] Christian that means that you belong to
[36:13] a bunch of people that's organizing you
[36:14] belong to the Lutheran Lodge the Baptist
[36:17] Lodge the Pentecostal Lodge there is no
[36:20] such a thing as Pentecostal Church there
[36:22] is no such a thing as Baptist Church
[36:24] it's Baptist Lodge Pentecostal LGE
[36:28] Presbyterian Lodge but there's only one
[36:30] church and there's only one way you can
[36:32] get into it that's by
[36:34] birth you're born into the Church of
[36:37] Jesus Christ and a member of his body of
[36:40] the spiritual delegation of heaven then
[36:43] the signs that Christ is with you lives
[36:46] through you Christians all you must have
[36:49] a personal relationship to
[36:54] God in order to be a son of God you must
[36:58] become relation to God he must be your
[37:03] father in order for you to be a son and
[37:06] only his sons and daughters are saved
[37:09] not the members of a church but Sons and
[37:12] Daughters there's only thing one thing
[37:13] that will produce that that's the new
[37:16] birth the new birth is the only thing
[37:19] that will produce relationship to
[37:22] God is that right Sons and Daughters
[37:26] then when this takes place
[37:28] then the man here's the question I want
[37:29] to get to you the man says what do we do
[37:32] then after we've been born again so many
[37:35] asked me that question what should I do
[37:37] then brother brand if you are born again
[37:40] your entire nature is changed you are
[37:44] dead to the things you once
[37:45] thought well you say brother brandom
[37:48] when I joined church I got that well
[37:50] then when God said Jesus Christ is the
[37:52] same yeserday and forever he still heals
[37:54] the sick he still shows Vision but
[37:56] brother Brandon my church you're not
[37:58] born
[38:00] again you can't be for if the very God
[38:05] if his life is in you like that you're
[38:07] in the life of your father and if the
[38:09] very life of God is in you and the Very
[38:12] spirit that was in Christ in you how can
[38:14] the spirit live in Jesus Christ and
[38:16] write this and then come back down in
[38:18] you and deny
[38:21] that can't do it it'll punctuate every
[38:24] word to be sto then if you say well I'm
[38:27] a good member of the church that don't
[38:29] have one thing to do with it I know the
[38:32] Heathen Down in Africa amongst my dark
[38:34] Brethren down there I find the morals of
[38:37] them people higher than than 90% of the
[38:39] American
[38:41] people while in some of the tribes there
[38:44] if a young girl is not married till
[38:45] she's a certain age or when she's a
[38:48] certain size and no one has taken her
[38:50] yet they know these something wrong they
[38:53] excommunicate her she take off tribal
[38:54] paint and she goes to the city then she
[38:56] just becomes a
[38:58] Renegade and when she's married she's
[39:00] tested for her vcy if the little virgent
[39:02] bail is broke then she has to tell who
[39:04] done it and they kill them both
[39:06] together would it be a lot of Killing In
[39:08] America if that taken place then you
[39:11] call them
[39:12] heathens oh my they can come teach
[39:16] people to call themselves church members
[39:18] how to live clean that's right never
[39:21] found one case of aeral in the whole
[39:23] trip through South Africa you don't have
[39:25] such a thing there he are see it's just
[39:28] our own dirty filthy ways it's white
[39:32] people that's right got away from
[39:34] God when this takes place the thing you
[39:37] do then you'll find out that the spirit
[39:39] that comes in you from the New Birth you
[39:42] will believe and do everything that God
[39:45] says in his words for you to do amen and
[39:49] everything that the Bible quotes for you
[39:51] to do you'll punctuate with
[39:53] amen and you'll not stop day and night
[39:56] until you receive it amen that's right
[39:58] that's right and in all this time you'll
[40:01] certainly above everything bear the
[40:04] fruit of the spirit you say will I speak
[40:07] with tongues you might do that and you
[40:09] might not will I shout you might do that
[40:11] you might not but there's one sure thing
[40:14] you will do you will bear the Fruit of
[40:17] the Spirit and the fruit of the spirit
[40:20] is love joy peace Faith longsuffering
[40:25] meekness gentleness patience your temper
[40:28] not
[40:29] be just remember when you got that that
[40:32] poisons the holy spirit away from
[40:35] you when you get to a place that you
[40:37] want to fuss with everybody you come
[40:40] along to there's something
[40:43] wrong when you get a place where the a
[40:45] minister read from the Bible That's
[40:48] wrong to do a certain thing you just
[40:51] remember there's no Christianity there
[40:53] at
[40:53] all that's now that by the fruits you
[40:56] shall know that
[40:57] that's what Jesus says see if it's the
[41:00] word and God said so yet spirit in you
[41:02] will cope with that word every time
[41:04] because genuine Holy Spirit Will cope
[41:08] with the word because the word is life
[41:11] in spirit Jesus said my words are life
[41:14] and if you've got eternal life and he is
[41:17] the word how can the word deny the word
[41:20] that's right what kind of a person would
[41:22] you make
[41:23] God that's one thing to know that you're
[41:25] a Christian when you can ful agree upon
[41:28] every word of God and you find yourself
[41:30] in love with your
[41:32] enemies somebody said well he's nothing
[41:34] but a holy rer and you start get oh be
[41:38] careful be careful but when you really
[41:41] find yourself that you love regardless
[41:43] of what they do you still love
[41:45] them then you're begin to find and your
[41:48] patience gets from about that long till
[41:50] just don't have no end anybody just
[41:53] keeps saying things about you I don't
[41:54] care what you say don't get stirred up
[41:57] if he get stirred up you better go pray
[41:58] first before he talk to him
[42:01] again don't get in fusses don't like to
[42:04] get in fuss if you like to see somebody

[44:04] and the things that you think on the
[44:07] things that you do the actions the
[44:09] things you talk about creates an
[44:11] atmosphere I went into a man's office
[44:14] here in this city and a man is a trustee
[44:17] or a deacon it is in a fine church now I
[44:20] went in there to see that man about some
[44:22] business and there's a radio over there
[44:25] at that rock and roll or twist
[44:26] everywhere was just as hard as it could
[44:28] go and I guess there was 40 Pinups in
[44:30] his office of nude
[44:33] women now you can't tell me how much
[44:36] Deacon or how much more you let me see
[44:39] what you look at what you read and the
[44:41] kind of music you listen to the crowd
[44:43] you associate with and I'll tell you
[44:45] what kind of a spirit's in
[44:48] you you hear God say me do so and
[44:52] so that bunch of just remember I don't
[44:55] care what he says his words speaks
[44:57] louder his action speaks louder than
[44:59] what anything to think he could testify
[45:01] say as a Christian sure and maybe do
[45:04] anything but you just watch the kind of
[45:05] a life he lives that tells what he
[45:08] is now could you imagine that a man with
[45:11] a life that would say the believe in
[45:13] Divine Healing that's something for the
[45:15] birds that was back in years ago there's
[45:17] no such a thing today is that a life
[45:20] worthy of the Gospel that Christ was
[45:22] wounded for our transgressions and with
[45:24] the stripes we were healed
[45:27] you say but I'm a deacon I don't care
[45:29] you might be a
[45:30] bishop when I heard Bishop Sheen say
[45:33] about two years ago coming down every
[45:35] turnning on again when he said a man
[45:37] that would believe and try to live by
[45:39] that Bible was like somebody trying to
[45:41] walk through muddy
[45:43] waters Bishop Sheen then turned around
[45:46] and said when I get to heaven you know
[45:48] what when I meet Jesus I'm going to tell
[45:50] him I'm Bishop Sheen and he said oh yes
[45:54] I heard my mother speak of you
[45:58] paganism man that would blaspheme that
[46:01] word God be merciful I ain't the
[46:04] judge that word's the truth that's right
[46:07] the spirit of God will recognize his own
[46:11] writing he's identified by his
[46:14] writing it it it speaks of him and
[46:17] you're identified by believing it that
[46:20] it gives you your credentials of
[46:23] identification don't fuss with others
[46:26] and don't uh and don't have these family
[46:28] fusses as I said love breeds love and
[46:31] temper breeds temper now now let's watch
[46:35] look at Jesus just for a minute he was
[46:37] your
[46:38] example I hope you're not getting too
[46:40] tired look let's look at Jesus just a
[46:43] minute he was our example he said so for
[46:47] I have given you an example that you
[46:50] should do to others as I've done to you
[46:53] now watch when he came into the world
[46:56] when there was more as much unbelief in
[46:57] the world right then as there ever was
[47:00] it didn't even slow him up he went right
[47:03] on preaching just the same and healing
[47:05] just the thing never bothered him there
[47:08] was critics the man was criticized from
[47:11] the time he was a baby until he died on
[47:13] the cross did it stop him no sir what
[47:17] was his goal always do that which the
[47:20] father has
[47:22] written always do what's
[47:25] pleasing look at Jesus talk about us
[47:27] humbling ourselves when God himself
[47:30] became a baby instead of coming in a a
[47:33] little crib somewhere in a decent home
[47:36] was barned out there over a manure Pile
[47:38] in a stable amongst balling cab they
[47:42] wrapped him his swy closes off the neck
[47:44] of a Yol of an ox the poorest of the
[47:47] poorest and yet the creator of heavens
[47:49] and
[47:50] earth one cold rainy night they said
[47:53] Master we'll go home with you he said
[47:55] the foxes has whole
[47:57] and the birds has Nest but I don't even
[47:59] have a place to lay my
[48:01] head
[48:03] God
[48:05] jovah humble himself and become a man
[48:10] represented in sinful flesh to redeem
[48:13] you and me who are we then he was our
[48:18] example who am I
[48:21] nothing I was telling someone this
[48:24] afternoon in a little meeting I that
[48:26] every son that's born of God has to be
[48:28] tried first
[48:30] chasen I remember when I had mine my
[48:34] greatest hour when a when a man's born
[48:37] to get there's a little spotlike size of
[48:39] his fingernail that God injects into him
[48:42] system and it falls into his heart and
[48:45] there are anchors then Satan makes him
[48:47] prove
[48:48] it and if that ain't there you're gone I
[48:51] remember there in the hospital I about
[48:53] 22 years old 23 Maybe
[48:57] long as young
[48:58] man and my father dying in my arms and
[49:02] me talking to God Is A Healer and my own

[49:12] him turn those eyes and look at me and
[49:14] fall off to go to meet
[49:17] God I took him over and bearded him by
[49:20] the side of my brother and the flowers
[49:23] are still fresh on his grave

[52:47] about you're just a boy look around over
[52:50] the city every girl and every boy you

[52:53] your mind you have now you couldn't tell
[52:56] me there's no God cuz I'd already seen
[52:58] it but he told me he didn't care for me
[53:01] said all night long all day long I said
[53:03] that to god what have I done show me
[53:06] Lord don't let the innocent have to
[53:07] suffer for me if I've done wrong I
[53:09] didn't know he was trying me but every
[53:12] son that comes to God's got to be tried
[53:15] I said tell me what I've done I'll make
[53:16] it right what have I done but preach all
[53:19] day long and all night long and just
[53:22] giving my life constantly what have I
[53:24] done Satan said that's right you see now
[53:26] comes to you and you've told all of them
[53:28] that you believe it he's a great healer
[53:30] and there lays your baby laying there
[53:33] dying he refused even year and your wife
[53:35] died with two berkers pneumonia you said
[53:37] he could heal Cancers and there he is
[53:40] now you talk about him being good and
[53:43] how good he is to people what about you
[53:46] then I begin to listen to him that's
[53:48] reasoning I thought that's right said he
[53:51] could just you don't have to speak the
[53:52] word just look to your baby to live I
[53:54] said that's right and his as much as
[53:56] you've done for him and yet that's what
[53:58] he does for you I said that's right I
[54:01] begin to think well what see everything
[54:04] begin to break away when it come to
[54:06] reasonings but when it come to that that
[54:09] hung it stayed there I was just about
[54:13] ready to say that I'll quit but when it
[54:15] got down to all the reasoning powers
[54:17] that broke away then it come to that
[54:19] eternal life that new birth what if it
[54:22] hadn't have been
[54:23] there what if it hadn't
[54:26] we wouldn't have know one another way we
[54:28] do now this church would have not been
[54:30] here like this the thousands and
[54:33] millions around the
[54:36] world but thank God it was there then
[54:40] when I thought what who am I anyhow who
[54:43] am I to question his
[54:46] majesty who am I to question the Creator
[54:48] to give me my very life here on Earth
[54:51] where did I get that baby who' give it
[54:53] to
[54:54] me not mine anyhow just loaned her to me
[54:57] for a while I said Satan get away from
[55:00] me I want over laid my hand on the baby
[55:03] I said God bless you sweet heart in a
[55:05] minute daddy will take you down put your
[55:06] own mommy's arms the angels will pack
[55:08] your little soul away and I'll meet you
[55:10] in that morning I said Lord you give her
[55:12] to me you're taking her away though you
[55:14] slay me like job said yet I love you and
[55:17] I believe you if you send me to hell I
[55:19] love you anyhow I can't get away from
[55:22] that
[55:23] are you been intellectual it all broke
[55:26] away but you got to have personal
[55:30] relationship youve got to be born
[55:33] again that's the reason ministers give
[55:35] away great charges and things they say
[55:37] there's no such a thing as Divine
[55:39] Healing no such a thing as these things
[55:41] they've never been on that sacred
[55:43] ground I speaking this morning they know
[55:45] nothing of it how can they say that
[55:47] they're children of God and deny the
[55:49] word of God how can you do it denying
[55:53] the very holy spirit that bought you oh
[55:56] just remember Jesus humbled himself to
[56:00] death for you he was not fussy when they
[56:03] spit in his face he didn't spit back
[56:06] when they pulled his beard out he didn't
[56:07] pull it theirs well they slapped him
[56:10] from one side of the face the other he
[56:12] never slapped them he prayed for them
[56:14] walked on humbly he was an example of
[56:19] humility he was full of Faith why he
[56:22] know his words couldn't fail he so lived
[56:26] by by the word to he became the word oh
[56:30] God let me hold my both hands to God
[56:33] before this audience let me live like
[56:36] that let this word so become that me and
[56:40] this word's the same
[56:42] thing Let My Words Be this word let the
[56:45] meditation of my heart Let It Be in my
[56:48] Heart On My Mind tie his Commandments
[56:51] upon the post of my intelligence pie
[56:54] them upon the post of my heart heart let
[56:57] me just see him when Temptation Rises
[56:59] let me see
[57:01] Christ when things goes wrong let me
[57:03] just see him when I get ready and the
[57:05] enemy try to make me get angry let me
[57:07] see Jesus what would he do he was so
[57:10] much in the word that him and the word
[57:12] became the selfs same thing watch he
[57:15] didn't have to fuss he knew he and the
[57:19] Word was the same he know that he was
[57:22] God's word made
[57:24] manifest and it God
[57:26] command would finally conquer the world
[57:31] he know that his
[57:33] word he had Faith he know where he was
[57:36] at he didn't have to discuss and say
[57:39] here you could come over here devil said
[57:40] now look you can perform Miracles you
[57:42] know you got great faith you can perform
[57:44] Miracles I'll build you a bilding Twi
[57:46] size of or Roberts because people all if
[57:49] you thing you have do show them jump off
[57:51] this building here just go right down
[57:52] because it's written that the Angels
[57:54] bury the Earth at thir time Des for
[57:56] against the stone see he know he had
[57:59] power he know that he could do it he
[58:03] knew it was in him but he didn't want to
[58:05] use it till God told him to see he
[58:08] wanted to be God and him be the word all
[58:11] and he know that when he spoke anything
[58:14] that it was God's
[58:16] word and though heavens and earth pass
[58:19] away that word would someday conquer
[58:23] amen he wasn't fussy and steid he spoke
[58:27] just the words of God every word that
[58:29] come from his lips was God's anointed
[58:32] word wouldn't it be wonderful if we
[58:34] could say
[58:36] that my word and God's word is the same
[58:39] what I say he honors it because I do
[58:42] nothing till he tells me
[58:44] first there's your example there's a
[58:47] life worthy of the
[58:49] Gospel not those priests that were so
[58:52] educated and Polished and having all
[58:55] those great dignities and stand and make
[58:57] long prayers and devour Widow houses and
[59:00] devour the high seats and the and the
[59:02] congregation all these things that they
[59:04] was that wasn't a life worthy of the
[59:06] Gospel but he was worthy of the
[59:09] Gospel so much that God said this is my
[59:12] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased
[59:15] hear ye
[59:16] him my word is he he is my word he and I
[59:20] are the same no watch this now he know
[59:24] that his word would finally conquer the
[59:25] word
[59:27] he knew where his word came from he knew
[59:30] it could never fail that's Reas he said
[59:32] both heavens and earth will pass away
[59:34] but my word will never
[59:36] fail he could say that that was a man
[59:40] who him and God's word become the same
[59:42] he said to them you are do this that he
[59:44] said who can condemn me of sin who can
[59:47] accuse me sin is
[59:50] unbelief if I by the Finger of God cast
[59:53] out Devils who does your sons cast them
[59:55] out by
[59:57] see it wasn't that so it had to be
[59:58] something
[59:59] else if I they said well we've cast out
[1:00:02] Devils he said if I do it with the
[1:00:03] Finger of God a Vindicated word of God
[1:00:07] then who does your sons cast him out
[1:00:09] by let you be the
[1:00:11] judge the people of his days and the
[1:00:14] people of of C made fun of him talked
[1:00:18] about him but he the humiliated him
[1:00:20] every way they could told him of all
[1:00:22] kinds of evil against him but he went on
[1:00:24] now I want to close a minute but saying
[1:00:26] this the people of this days are a bunch
[1:00:28] of
[1:00:30] neurotics the people of this day are a
[1:00:32] bunch of neurotics they are afraid to
[1:00:36] take the promises of
[1:00:38] God Church man Church
[1:00:43] organizations Church organizations are
[1:00:45] afraid to take the challenge of God's
[1:00:48] scripture for the this day they realize
[1:00:52] they realize that their modern
[1:00:54] conditions and their Social Gospel as
[1:00:57] they preach will not meet the challenge
[1:00:59] of this
[1:01:01] hour no more than Samson could meet it
[1:01:03] in his condition it took God and here's
[1:01:07] a program that promised him I'll get to
[1:01:10] that just in a minute I want to hold
[1:01:11] that word a
[1:01:13] minute though they call themselves
[1:01:16] Christian they adopt Creeds man-made
[1:01:19] Creeds to take the place of God's word
[1:01:22] so they can take the Creed because the
[1:01:24] man made it but they are afraid to lay
[1:01:27] their faith out there in the god that
[1:01:29] they claim that they love that's right
[1:01:33] and then you say that life worthy of the
[1:01:35] Gospel can't be though they be church
[1:01:38] members but that's not worthy of the
[1:01:41] Gospel no indeed the gospel Jesus said
[1:01:43] go into all the world and preach the
[1:01:45] gospel to Every Creature these signs
[1:01:46] shall follow the Believers and when you
[1:01:49] deny that the follow the Believers how
[1:01:50] can you have a life no matter you might
[1:01:53] not never say a bad word you might keep
[1:01:56] all the Ten Commandments that won't have
[1:01:58] one thing to do with it it's still not
[1:01:59] worthy of the Gospel see it couldn't be
[1:02:03] those priests kept that and still was
[1:02:05] not worthy he said you're your father
[1:02:07] the
[1:02:08] devil who could lay a finger on one of
[1:02:10] that man one guilty Mark and they were
[1:02:12] stoned without
[1:02:14] Mercy holy man and Jesus said you're of
[1:02:17] your father the
[1:02:19] devil when the gospel came into though
[1:02:22] they call themselves Christians they
[1:02:24] love to hold to the creeds
[1:02:26] the
[1:02:28] Creeds the Creeds institutes and
[1:02:32] fulfills the thinking of the modern
[1:02:35] people of this day and a man that's
[1:02:37] going to be a success in this day has to
[1:02:40] go with the Modern Trend of
[1:02:42] thinking let me say that good and clear
[1:02:46] see a man if you're going to be a
[1:02:50] success you have to go with the modern
[1:02:53] thinking of this day
[1:02:56] they're going and say oh isn't he a
[1:02:57] darling isn't he wonderful he you just
[1:03:00] stay there so straight and he never
[1:03:02] keeps his over 15 minutes and our pastor
[1:03:04] don't always ball us out about these
[1:03:06] things shame on that Pastor any man that
[1:03:10] can stand up open and look up on the sin
[1:03:13] of this day and not cry out there's
[1:03:15] something wrong with that
[1:03:16] man he's not worthy of the Gospel that
[1:03:19] he claims to be preaching that's right
[1:03:22] so by doing so they make themselves
[1:03:24] excuses but saying now look my
[1:03:27] congregation a a man come here not long
[1:03:29] ago to a certain great church and he was
[1:03:31] writing a thesia and he said I'm writing
[1:03:33] on Divine Healing said brother brandham
[1:03:35] we love you in our denomination one of
[1:03:37] the greatest denominations one of the
[1:03:39] greatest of the nation or the world and
[1:03:41] he said uh we love you in this
[1:03:43] denomination he right here at the
[1:03:44] Jefferson Villa but said I come to find
[1:03:46] out about this Divine Healing he said
[1:03:49] there's only one fault that my church
[1:03:50] really finds so he said you associate
[1:03:52] around too many
[1:03:54] Pentecostals I said well you know that
[1:03:56] is
[1:03:57] right I said that's trueth you know I've
[1:04:00] always wanted an opportunity to get away
[1:04:02] from him I said I tell you what I'll
[1:04:04] come to your town you get your church to
[1:04:06] sponsor me oh he said they would that's
[1:04:08] what I
[1:04:10] thought thought I thought said you see
[1:04:13] my denomination won't stand for that
[1:04:15] that's as much excuse as I've married a
[1:04:17] wife or bought a yoka o I don't care how
[1:04:21] many doctor's degrees you've got and how
[1:04:23] much you're looked up to by your
[1:04:24] denomination that that sort of a
[1:04:27] Ministry is not worthy of the Gospel
[1:04:29] it's wrote in this
[1:04:30] book
[1:04:32] right any church member that'll s in
[1:04:36] with such stuff as that and call
[1:04:37] themselves a Christian and go out here
[1:04:39] and live and the women bobing their hair
[1:04:41] and wearing clothes that the Bible says
[1:04:44] for not to man carrying on the way
[1:04:46] they're doing now a farm of godlin
[1:04:48] taking drinks and smoking cigars and
[1:04:50] marrying several times and becoming
[1:04:52] deacons of the church and even pastors
[1:04:55] and so forth and the people have put up
[1:04:57] with such as that that sort of life is
[1:04:59] not worthy of the
[1:05:00] Gospel a woman that'll walk and get on
[1:05:03] the telephone and tattle and start
[1:05:05] fusses in the church and things like
[1:05:07] that that is a life worthy of the Gospel
[1:05:09] that we're R to represent any person
[1:05:12] that'll break up a church and start a
[1:05:14] feud between the people and things like
[1:05:16] that is not worthy of the Gospel that we
[1:05:20] preach exactly it's a form of godliness
[1:05:23] denying the power thereof the power of
[1:05:26] God that keeps you from such
[1:05:28] notice
[1:05:29] now they don't do it they just won't do
[1:05:32] it they have the excuse that their
[1:05:33] Church don't believe in it they went up
[1:05:36] with Jesus and say say to a man tonight
[1:05:38] speak to his heart and say I want you to
[1:05:41] go preach the full go my church doesn't
[1:05:43] stand for it Lord you excuse me if you
[1:05:44] will I've got a fine charge I I you know
[1:05:47] I'm a pastor one of the greatest
[1:05:48] churches in this city Lord oh we praise
[1:05:50] your name down there yes sir we sure do
[1:05:52] I can't do it the same excuse
[1:05:56] same thing so they don't come to the
[1:06:00] spiritual Feast of his promised
[1:06:02] Vindicated word did not Jesus say where
[1:06:06] the carcasses the Eagles will gather
[1:06:09] Eagles not buzzards now
[1:06:12] Eagles where the slop is and a and a a
[1:06:16] carrying then the buzzers GA but where
[1:06:19] the fresh clean meat is the Eagles are
[1:06:22] gathered certainly for the word Eagle
[1:06:26] Food they'll gather so they don't come
[1:06:29] to the spiritual Feast that they're
[1:06:31] invited to do you believe that God has
[1:06:32] given America an invitation the last 15
[1:06:35] years to a great Revival to a spiritual
[1:06:37] Feast did they come no sir no sir then
[1:06:41] to reject to come is that life worthy of
[1:06:44] the Gospel though they call themselves
[1:06:47] that when a man come to me not long ago

[1:07:23] Lord she'll be healed great spot in her
[1:07:26] back sunk in like that looked like a
[1:07:28] great big uh like the uh part of a
[1:07:31] woman's breast pulled inwardly in her

[1:07:45] faith how can I keep from bleeding you

[1:07:49] and told just exactly what would happen
[1:07:51] he said now I've got something for you
[1:07:53] brother Brandon he said I belong to the
[1:07:55] greatest Pentecostal League there is I
[1:07:57] said yes sure I know that he said I
[1:08:00] talked with the brother not long ago and
[1:08:02] they told me to get in contact with you
[1:08:04] and tell you that it was a shame that
[1:08:07] you took that god-given Ministry to a
[1:08:10] bunch of people off the river around
[1:08:11] like
[1:08:12] that I said that right said yes said God
[1:08:17] sent that Ministry to hit the nerve
[1:08:18] spots the big spot the highlights I seen
[1:08:21] the devil talking right then I thought
[1:08:24] yeah
[1:08:26] jumped out off this mountain and show
[1:08:27] you know off this building see I thought
[1:08:30] this lead him out a little far my old
[1:08:31] mother used to say give the cow enough
[1:08:33] rope she'll hang her own celf I said is
[1:08:35] that right yes said it's a shame but
[1:08:37] what you do said what are you today you
[1:08:40] can hardly buy yourself a
[1:08:42] meal and said look at Oral Roberts them
[1:08:45] stepped in and got out there with the
[1:08:48] 100th of the ministry you got look what
[1:08:50] they go I said yeah that's right see and
[1:08:54] he said my group will take you we'll
[1:08:56] take you right in as as one of our
[1:08:58] Brethren they'll all give you the right
[1:08:59] hand of fellowship and we'll Charter a
[1:09:01] plane and give you a wages of 500 a week

[1:09:06] you to every major city in the country

[1:09:11] we'll pay your said then let the world
[1:09:13] the outside
[1:09:15] world let the dignitaries the big guys
[1:09:18] the up and up so you're always talking
[1:09:20] about the down and out they got the up
[1:09:22] and outs so let them see the hand of the
[1:09:24] Lord and that take my wife long and
[1:09:26] others can prove that those things that
[1:09:28] you say comes to pass I said yes sir
[1:09:31] that' be great I see the man in the
[1:09:33] position of a dld d a writer of Books
[1:09:38] see doctor of literature fine writer
[1:09:41] fine man see he didn't know the
[1:09:45] scripture did you know that angel that
[1:09:47] performed them kind of works never did
[1:09:49] go to Sodom he stayed with the called
[1:09:52] out group
[1:09:53] Abraham you just didn't know
[1:09:56] I just let him alone just sat there a
[1:09:58] little bit I just wanted to see what the
[1:10:00] catch was now I said well uh what would
[1:10:03] I have to do said well brother brand
[1:10:06] just the only thing they said we
[1:10:07] discussed it a few things little petty
[1:10:09] things that you teach it you just lay
[1:10:11] them aside I said for instance what
[1:10:16] brother all he said you're baptism you
[1:10:18] know you know you kind of baptized like
[1:10:20] the oness something like that said
[1:10:21] little things like that I said oh I went
[1:10:24] ahead and he said the initial evidence
[1:10:27] women preachers and just a few little
[1:10:29] things like that I said
[1:10:30] uhhuh I said you know I'm surpris that
[1:10:33] one servant of God would ask another
[1:10:35] servant of God after paying the tribute
[1:10:37] to me you did and calling me a
[1:10:40] prophet and knowing that the word of the
[1:10:43] lord of the revelation of the word comes
[1:10:45] to the prophet and you turn around Dr
[1:10:48] Pope and don't speak of your good
[1:10:50] intelligence and would say and ask one
[1:10:53] servant of God you asked another servant
[1:10:55] of God to compromise on the thing that
[1:10:57] live means more to him in life
[1:11:01] itself I said no sir brother fol by no
[1:11:05] means what I do it no sir what is it
[1:11:09] there's a grain of eternal life live or
[1:11:12] die whether you're a great guy or not a
[1:11:14] great
[1:11:17] guy praise
[1:11:19] God where he finished right there with
[1:11:23] the Temptation from that brother to
[1:11:25] compromise a little bit to have the big
[1:11:27] meetings and all that I sit there and
[1:11:29] think I'm so glad that that grain of
[1:11:31] eternal life held amen we're the
[1:11:35] benefactors of that if we could go
[1:11:39] uh uh back to the questions there they
[1:11:43] are a Christian cannot be a Christian
[1:11:46] until what oh actually before we get
[1:11:49] there I want to I want to go to one uh
[1:11:52] little spot here on page 23 if we can
[1:11:54] turn to page 23
[1:11:55] I just want to highlight this cuzz it
[1:11:57] stood out to me brother man was talking
[1:11:59] about his meetings in Mexico and when
[1:12:02] the little woman with the dead baby was
[1:12:03] trying to get in and they had to prevent
[1:12:05] her from coming and all of a sudden he
[1:12:07] saw the vision and he saw a vision of a
[1:12:09] laughing uh baby and he told Billy Paul
[1:12:12] to let her in and so she come and he was
[1:12:14] going to pray for her but I love the way
[1:12:16] that he
[1:12:17] prays uh uh paragraph 117 on page 23 so
[1:12:22] we opened up the crowd like that and
[1:12:23] brought her through here she come
[1:12:25] falling on her knees with the prayer
[1:12:27] beads in her hand I said and I said get
[1:12:29] up I said heavenly father now I don't
[1:12:31] know what you're going to do I don't
[1:12:33] know whether you just want me to satisfy
[1:12:36] the Wind by praying for the baby or what
[1:12:38] I said I lay my hands upon the little
[1:12:39] baby in the name of the Lord Jesus just
[1:12:42] the same thing as I did to brother wayy
[1:12:43] laying there on the floor dead the other
[1:12:45] day and the blanket kicked and that
[1:12:47] little baby started screaming and it was
[1:12:49] to his life but I love his attitude and
[1:12:52] his approach he saw a vision of a
[1:12:53] laughing baby
[1:12:55] and brought the woman up and then he
[1:12:57] said Lord I don't know what you're going
[1:12:59] to
[1:13:00] do I just love that humility I love that
[1:13:03] honesty I love that raw reality where he
[1:13:05] didn't have to prove anything or show
[1:13:07] anything all he knows is he saw a baby
[1:13:09] he doesn't know is this the baby is this
[1:13:11] or God what do you want me to do you
[1:13:13] just want me to appease her he doesn't
[1:13:15] already have it figured out all he does
[1:13:17] is walk by faith and that's the way I
[1:13:19] want to walk I don't want to have to
[1:13:21] have it all figured out I just want to
[1:13:22] take each step as he leads me along the
[1:13:24] way
[1:13:25] amen when we go to the the question now
[1:13:29] a Christian cannot be a Christian until
[1:13:31] what let's go to paragraph 129 over on
[1:13:35] page 25 at the bottom of page 25
[1:13:38] paragraph
[1:13:40] 129 brother bam set down he's going to
[1:13:43] set down a principle that's going to be
[1:13:45] really important to the rest of this
[1:13:46] that we listen to said a Christian is
[1:13:49] not a tool or some kind of a mechanical
[1:13:51] wrench to a great big religious regime
[1:13:54] that's right a Christian is not some
[1:13:55] kind of tool that keeps a religious
[1:13:57] organization moving a Christian that is
[1:14:00] not a Christian a Christian is to be
[1:14:02] Christlike so start right there a
[1:14:04] Christian is to be
[1:14:06] Christlike so a Christian doesn't mean
[1:14:08] to be part of a Christian group or a
[1:14:11] Christian organization or a Christian
[1:14:13] work so to be part of a group cannot
[1:14:15] make you a
[1:14:17] Christian so to be a Christian you have
[1:14:19] to be Christlike amen and a Christian
[1:14:23] cannot be a Christian until Christ comes
[1:14:25] into the man and the life of Christ in
[1:14:28] him then it produces the life that
[1:14:30] Christ lived and you do the things that
[1:14:32] Christ did what am I talking about
[1:14:35] personal relationship to Christ what is
[1:14:37] it is your life worthy of the Gospel so
[1:14:40] he says now you cannot be a Christian
[1:14:43] just to be part of the organization or
[1:14:45] part of the group though it's a
[1:14:47] Christian
[1:14:48] group so you cannot be Christian by
[1:14:50] label and you cannot be Christian by
[1:14:52] joining what's Christian you can only be
[1:14:55] be Christian by being Christlike but you
[1:14:57] cannot be Christlike by being taught how
[1:14:59] to be Christlike you cannot be
[1:15:01] Christlike by following rules following
[1:15:03] orders uh being instructed and when
[1:15:05] somebody does this then you answer this
[1:15:07] way that doesn't make you Christlike you
[1:15:09] can only be Christlike if the Life of
[1:15:11] Christ is born inside of you and that's
[1:15:13] the only way you can be a
[1:15:15] Christian is for the Life of Christ is
[1:15:18] to have the new birth The Life of Christ
[1:15:20] Living inside of you and that's what
[1:15:22] brother bham calls personal relationship
[1:15:25] to Christ in the token message he said
[1:15:27] it's you and Christ as persons together
[1:15:30] amen let's turn the
[1:15:32] page uh no we'll leave it at that we'll
[1:15:36] go to the next question there's some
[1:15:37] more of this that we'll pick up as we go
[1:15:39] on the next question is what will
[1:15:42] produce relationship with God let's go
[1:15:45] to paragraph
[1:15:48] 137 and I'm going to take the second
[1:15:50] half of 137 it's actually at the top of
[1:15:53] page 27 so we're going to begin right at
[1:15:55] the top of page uh
[1:15:57] 27 but there is the kind of excuse that
[1:15:59] people may say I'm a presbyterian we
[1:16:02] don't believe in that I'm a Baptist we
[1:16:03] don't believe in such stuff well I'm a
[1:16:06] Lutheran well that don't have anything
[1:16:08] to do with it that don't mean you're a
[1:16:10] Christian that means that you belong to
[1:16:12] a bunch of people that's organized and
[1:16:14] you belong to the Lutheran Lodge and the
[1:16:15] Baptist Lodge and the Pentecostal Lodge
[1:16:18] there's no such thing excuse me it's a
[1:16:20] Pentecostal Church there is no such
[1:16:22] thing as a Baptist Church it's a Baptist
[1:16:23] Lodge a Pentecostal Lodge a presbyterian
[1:16:26] Lodge I just want to share a testimony
[1:16:29] with you on that really quickly I was
[1:16:31] listening to this or something just like
[1:16:32] this I don't know if it's this exact
[1:16:34] section but it was where brother Brenham
[1:16:35] was calling the church's lodges and IID
[1:16:37] first come to the message I was I was a
[1:16:40] new convert new believer in the message
[1:16:42] and and I'll tell you how long it was
[1:16:44] ago it was I was away for factory
[1:16:46] training and I was up in Eerie
[1:16:49] Pennsylvania and they were they put us
[1:16:51] in a hotel and every day they'd pick us
[1:16:53] up in a 15 passenger van and they would
[1:16:55] take us to the factory for factory
[1:16:57] training well on the ride back and forth
[1:17:00] I had a Walkman radio with earbuds does
[1:17:02] anybody remember what a Walkman radio
[1:17:04] you put doublea batteries in it you can
[1:17:06] put a cassette tape in it and and you
[1:17:08] were the coolest thing in school if you
[1:17:10] had one of those some of you guys will
[1:17:13] see one in the museum one day or
[1:17:14] something but but I had one of those
[1:17:16] Walkman radios and I had my headphones
[1:17:19] on and I was sitting all the way back up
[1:17:22] against the window with my head lean the
[1:17:24] window and I was was listening to
[1:17:25] brother bam say something exactly like
[1:17:27] this I don't know if this section of
[1:17:28] tape or not and I had a thought in my
[1:17:30] heart I don't know about that because I
[1:17:33] grew up in church Realms and was in
[1:17:34] church all of my life and it was a
[1:17:36] little bit of a strong statement for me
[1:17:38] coming out of the Pentecostal church and
[1:17:41] as soon as I thought that we drove by
[1:17:43] and there was a Sign by the road that
[1:17:45] said the Manchester Presbyterian
[1:17:50] Lodge yeah can you imagine what reaction
[1:17:53] I had I said forgive me
[1:17:55] Lord I believe it now and when we first
[1:17:59] come to the message God did so many
[1:18:00] things like that for us and when I read
[1:18:02] through this it just reminded me of that
[1:18:04] and I wanted to share that with you god
[1:18:05] is so mindful of his children
[1:18:08] amen amen then it goes on he says but
[1:18:11] there's only one church and there's only
[1:18:13] one way you can get into it and that's
[1:18:15] by birth so you can't join it friends
[1:18:19] it's by birth you're born into the
[1:18:21] Church of Jesus Christ and a member of
[1:18:23] his body of the spiritual delegation of
[1:18:25] heaven then the signs that Christ is
[1:18:27] with you lives through you Christians oh
[1:18:30] you must have a personal relationship to
[1:18:33] God in order to be a Son of God you must
[1:18:35] become relation to
[1:18:36] God he must be your father in order for
[1:18:40] you to be a son and that only his sons
[1:18:42] and daughters are saved not the members
[1:18:44] of a church but Sons and Daughters
[1:18:46] there's only one thing that will produce
[1:18:48] that that's the new birth the new birth
[1:18:50] is the only thing that will produce
[1:18:51] relationship to God that's right sons
[1:18:54] and daughters
[1:18:55] then when this takes place then men
[1:18:57] here's the question I want to get to you
[1:18:59] the man says what what do we do then
[1:19:02] after we're born again so many asked me
[1:19:04] that question what should I do then
[1:19:05] brother brandom if you're born again
[1:19:07] your entire nature is changed you are
[1:19:09] dead to the things that you once thought
[1:19:11] well you say brother benam when I joined
[1:19:13] a church I got that well then when God
[1:19:15] said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:19:17] today and forever he still heals the
[1:19:19] sick he shows Visions but brother brenon
[1:19:22] my church now you're not born again
[1:19:25] what's he saying if you reject the word
[1:19:27] of God because of whatever Church
[1:19:29] tradition or whatever idea the minute
[1:19:31] you reject the word of God it proves
[1:19:33] you're not born again
[1:19:35] amen CU this all just blows up the whole
[1:19:38] idea of being born again from
[1:19:39] denominational world the denomination
[1:19:41] world thinks that if you make a
[1:19:43] confession out of your mouth or you come
[1:19:44] to an altar you shake a hand or you join
[1:19:46] the church that you're born again no
[1:19:48] you're only born again when that seed of
[1:19:50] God on the inside comes in contact with
[1:19:52] the Living Word Jesus Christ and he
[1:19:55] quickens that seed to life and he said
[1:19:57] you can only have relationship with God
[1:19:59] if you're a son or daughter of God not a
[1:20:01] member of a church so what makes you a
[1:20:04] son or daughter of God that you are
[1:20:05] offspring of God separated of God
[1:20:08] waiting to come back in contact with
[1:20:10] your father and what is the new birth
[1:20:12] it's Jesus Christ revealed personally to
[1:20:14] you where you're awakened to who you
[1:20:17] actually
[1:20:18] are and that seed comes to life and then
[1:20:20] you know that you're a Son of God
[1:20:23] because that's the only thing that can
[1:20:24] bring relationship to God is when you
[1:20:27] know you're a child of God not a member
[1:20:29] of a
[1:20:30] church so these things brother bram's
[1:20:32] teaching us is so vital and so important
[1:20:36] that you must in order to have a
[1:20:37] relationship you must be sons and
[1:20:39] daughters and only sons and daughters
[1:20:41] are born
[1:20:42] again they're the only ones who can be
[1:20:44] born again because it's a spiritual
[1:20:47] birth from the seed that's in the
[1:20:50] soul praise be to almighty God
[1:20:55] amen so you can only have relationship
[1:20:58] and you can only be a Christian if the
[1:20:59] Life of Christ lives inside of you and
[1:21:02] you can only have relationship with God
[1:21:03] is you have to be relation to him you
[1:21:07] hear how brother Rim said that you must
[1:21:08] be relation to him that means we must be
[1:21:11] related to have
[1:21:14] relationship so you can't teach that
[1:21:17] friends that's not teaching people how
[1:21:20] to meditate that's not teaching people
[1:21:22] how to say nice things are come to
[1:21:24] prayer meetings and that's that's not
[1:21:26] what builds relationship in order to
[1:21:28] build a relationship you have to
[1:21:29] actually be relation and he has to be
[1:21:31] your father and you have to be a son and
[1:21:33] that's how you have a relationship right
[1:21:36] not by teaching people how to say
[1:21:38] prayers or have devotion
[1:21:42] time we're not we don't we believe we
[1:21:45] should have devotion time we should
[1:21:46] believe we should spend time with them
[1:21:47] we believe should we further our
[1:21:48] relationship but you can only have a
[1:21:49] relationship if he's your father and
[1:21:51] you're his son and you're actually
[1:21:53] related
[1:21:56] yeah that's what the prophet is teaching
[1:21:59] us this message is so different than
[1:22:02] denominational teaching amen this is the
[1:22:06] reality the next
[1:22:09] question what is one thing to know that
[1:22:12] you're a Christian let's go to page 143
[1:22:16] or I'm sorry paragraph 143 on page
[1:22:21] 28 what is one thing to know that you're
[1:22:23] a Christian you remember remember you
[1:22:24] can't be a Christian until the Life of
[1:22:27] Christ comes in you and lives through
[1:22:29] you all
[1:22:31] right when so what is one thing to know
[1:22:34] that you're a Christian when this takes
[1:22:37] place the thing you'll do then you'll
[1:22:39] find out that the spirit that comes in
[1:22:41] you from the New Birth you will believe
[1:22:43] and do everything that God says in his
[1:22:45] word for you to do and everything that
[1:22:48] the Bible quotes for you to do you'll
[1:22:50] punctuate it with an amen and you'll not
[1:22:52] stop day and night until you receive it
[1:22:54] that's right that's right and in all
[1:22:57] this time you'll certainly above
[1:22:58] everything bear the fruit of the spirit
[1:23:00] you say will I speak with tongues you
[1:23:02] might do that and you might not well I
[1:23:05] shout you might do that and you might
[1:23:06] not but there's one sure thing you'll do
[1:23:09] you'll bear the Fruit of the Spirit and
[1:23:11] the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[1:23:13] peace Faith longsuffering meekness
[1:23:15] gentleness patience your temper will not
[1:23:17] be oh just remember when you got that
[1:23:20] that poisons the holy spirit away from
[1:23:22] you when you get to a place that you
[1:23:23] want to fuss with everybody you come
[1:23:25] along to there's something wrong when
[1:23:27] you get to a place where your minister
[1:23:29] will read from the Bible that it's wrong
[1:23:31] to do a certain thing and you just
[1:23:33] remember when you react remember there's
[1:23:35] no Christianity there at all that's Now
[1:23:38] by their fruits you shall know them
[1:23:40] that's what Jesus said see if it's the
[1:23:43] word and God said so that spirit in you
[1:23:46] will cope with the word every time
[1:23:48] because genuine Holy Spirit Will cope
[1:23:50] with the word because the word is life
[1:23:52] and spirit Jes Jesus said my words are
[1:23:55] life and if you've got eternal life and
[1:23:57] he's the word how can the word deny the
[1:24:00] word what kind of a person would you
[1:24:02] make God that's one thing to know that
[1:24:04] you're a Christian when you can fully
[1:24:06] agree upon every word of
[1:24:08] God Amen keep reading top of page 29 and
[1:24:13] you find yourself in love with your
[1:24:15] enemies somebody say well he's nothing
[1:24:18] but a Holy Roller and you start to get
[1:24:20] be careful be careful but when you
[1:24:23] really find yourself that you love him
[1:24:25] regardless of what they do you still
[1:24:27] love them then you begin to find and
[1:24:30] your patience gets from about that long
[1:24:31] till you just don't have no end anybody
[1:24:34] just keeps saying things about you well
[1:24:36] I don't care what you say don't get
[1:24:38] stirred up if you get stirred up you
[1:24:40] better go pray first before you talk to
[1:24:42] them
[1:24:44] again uh let's jump over to uh paragraph
[1:24:47] 154 on page
[1:24:52] 30 says now could you imagine imagine
[1:24:54] that a man with a life that would say to
[1:24:56] believe in Divine Healing that something
[1:24:58] for the birds that was back in years ago
[1:25:00] there's no such a thing today is that a
[1:25:03] life worthy of the Gospel that Christ
[1:25:05] was wounded for our transgressions and
[1:25:07] when his stripes we are healed you say
[1:25:09] but I'm a deacon I don't care you might
[1:25:10] be a bishop let's skip one paragraph and
[1:25:13] go down one more says that word is the
[1:25:16] truth right and the spirit of God will
[1:25:18] recognize his own writing he identified
[1:25:21] by his writing it speaks of him and
[1:25:24] you're identified by believing it and it
[1:25:27] gives you your credentials of
[1:25:29] identification so how do you get your
[1:25:31] credentials of identification not by
[1:25:34] what system you're joined to or what
[1:25:36] church you attend but by believing his
[1:25:40] word by believing all of his word and
[1:25:43] the word for our day when it's presented
[1:25:45] to us that gives us our credentials of
[1:25:49] identification amen praise
[1:25:52] God now when we go back and brother bam
[1:25:56] says there's one thing that you'll do
[1:25:58] for sure you will bear the fruit of the
[1:26:00] spirit then he says you'll love your
[1:26:02] enemy and then he says you'll have
[1:26:04] patience and you won't fuss and he goes
[1:26:06] into all this we'll read some of that a
[1:26:07] little bit later what brother brandom is
[1:26:10] not telling us he's not saying that you
[1:26:13] know you'll have massive control over
[1:26:16] your human nature and you'll bite your
[1:26:17] tongue and you won't say and you'll be
[1:26:20] you'll conform to a code of ethics where
[1:26:22] you won't be impatient and you'll you no
[1:26:25] he said that's a natural outcropping of
[1:26:28] having Jesus Christ's life inside of you
[1:26:31] it's not an effort it's not a put on
[1:26:34] it's not peacock feathers and a crow
[1:26:36] it's the actual you'll bear the fruit of
[1:26:38] the spirit not because you were taught
[1:26:40] to Bear the fruit of the spirit you'll
[1:26:42] bear the fruit of the spirit because
[1:26:43] that's the life of
[1:26:46] Christ he he'll explain that here in a
[1:26:48] little bit we'll get into that let's go
[1:26:50] to our next question now what creates an
[1:26:52] atmosphere around us
[1:26:55] page
[1:26:56] 29 paragraph
[1:26:58] 150 he says now don't fuss see temper
[1:27:01] breeds temper first thing you know
[1:27:03] you're grieving the holy spirit away
[1:27:05] from you you'll be fussing back then the
[1:27:07] Holy Spirit takes its flight temper
[1:27:09] breeds temper and love breeds love be
[1:27:12] full of love Jesus said this will all
[1:27:13] men know you're my disciples when you
[1:27:15] have love one for another that's the
[1:27:17] fruit of the Holy Spirit love and did
[1:27:20] you know you're a little Creator
[1:27:22] yourself you you know that certainly
[1:27:25] you've seen people that you just love to
[1:27:27] be around you don't know why just that
[1:27:29] loving type of person have you seen that
[1:27:32] just as kind they you like to be around
[1:27:35] them they create that Atmosphere by the
[1:27:37] life they live by the way they talk
[1:27:39] their
[1:27:40] conversation then you've seen those that
[1:27:42] every time you shun them all time they
[1:27:44] want to talk about something evil and
[1:27:46] talk about somebody say oh my there they
[1:27:48] come they're going to criticize somebody
[1:27:50] there he's in here now he's going to
[1:27:52] talk about this man all they're going to
[1:27:54] do is tell dirty jokes or something
[1:27:56] about women or something like that you
[1:27:58] just hate to get around that see they
[1:28:00] create seemingly pretty nice people but
[1:28:02] they create that atmosphere and the
[1:28:04] thing that you think on and the things
[1:28:07] that you do the actions and the thing
[1:28:09] you talk about creates an
[1:28:11] atmosphere so what creates that
[1:28:13] atmosphere around us the things that
[1:28:14] we're feeding on the things that the
[1:28:17] things that you think on the things that
[1:28:19] you do the actions the things you talk
[1:28:22] about creates an atmosphere well if I
[1:28:24] want the atmosphere of Christ about me
[1:28:26] what should I be thinking on and what
[1:28:28] should I be looking at and what I should
[1:28:29] I be talking about praise God a
[1:28:35] amen all right I just want to look at uh
[1:28:38] two more things that weren't in the
[1:28:40] questions if you go back to uh paragraph
[1:28:43] 120 just flip back with
[1:28:47] me paragraph 120 at the top of page 24
[1:28:54] paragraph 24 or page 24 paragraph 120
[1:28:57] they can't understand how a simple
[1:28:59] message a simple people to reject a
[1:29:02] thing like that would cause them to go
[1:29:04] into
[1:29:06] chaos paragraph 26 on page 25 now think
[1:29:11] of this as simple people God made it so
[1:29:13] simple how could Ahab how could Jezebel
[1:29:16] how could those people who thought that
[1:29:17] Elijah was a witch thought he was a
[1:29:19] spiritualist even Ahab said here is he
[1:29:21] the one that's caused all this trouble
[1:29:23] to Israel he said you're the one that's
[1:29:25] troubled Israel how could the nation
[1:29:27] think that to reject the message of a
[1:29:29] fuzzy faed man like that no Priestly
[1:29:31] garments on and so forth would be the
[1:29:33] condemnation of it how could Egypt the
[1:29:36] rule the world world pharaohs and its
[1:29:38] class and dignity the world has never
[1:29:40] come to that place again in science and
[1:29:42] so forth how could they think to reject
[1:29:44] an old prophet of 80 years old with
[1:29:46] Whiskers hanging down gray hair stomping
[1:29:48] out of their a fugitive and come out
[1:29:51] there with a message you'll either let
[1:29:53] them go or God will destroy the nation
[1:29:55] how could Pharaoh you obey me Pharaoh
[1:29:57] Pharaoh said obey
[1:30:00] oh obey oh him pharaoh and an old man
[1:30:03] some old crank they thought turn a guy
[1:30:05] down like that destroy a nation but it
[1:30:07] did oh
[1:30:10] my so what did Destruction come for why
[1:30:13] did why why did judgment and Destruction
[1:30:16] come because they turned down the simple
[1:30:18] message being carried by simple
[1:30:21] people because they rejected their day
[1:30:24] of visitation and they rejected the
[1:30:26] invitation to the spiritual Feast
[1:30:28] because it came in a simple way by
[1:30:30] simple
[1:30:32] people let's go to paragraph
[1:30:44] 157 on page 31 now let's watch look at
[1:30:49] Jesus just for a minute he was your
[1:30:51] example so if we ever want an example on
[1:30:54] life God gave us one when he came and
[1:30:56] lived in
[1:30:57] flesh I hope you're not getting too
[1:31:00] tired look let's look at Jesus just a
[1:31:02] minute he was our example said for I've
[1:31:04] given you an example that you should do
[1:31:06] to others as I have done to you now
[1:31:08] watch when he come into the world when
[1:31:10] there was more as much unbelief in the
[1:31:13] world right then as there ever was it
[1:31:15] didn't even slow him up he went right on
[1:31:18] preaching just the same and healing just
[1:31:20] the same never bothered him there was
[1:31:22] critics the man was criticized from the
[1:31:24] time he was a baby until he died on the
[1:31:26] cross did it stop him no sir what was
[1:31:29] his goal always do that always do that
[1:31:32] which the father has written always do
[1:31:34] which pleased him look at Jesus talk
[1:31:37] about us humbling ourselves when God
[1:31:40] himself became a baby instead of coming
[1:31:41] in a little crib somewhere in a decent
[1:31:43] home was born out there over a manure
[1:31:45] Pile in a stable amongst balling calves
[1:31:48] they wrapped him in swaddling clothes
[1:31:49] was off the neck of a yoke of an ox the
[1:31:52] poorest of the poorest and yet the CB of
[1:31:54] heavens and earth one cold rainy night
[1:31:56] they said Master we'll go home with you
[1:31:59] he said the foxes has holes and the
[1:32:00] birds has Nest but I don't even have a
[1:32:03] place to lay my head god Jehovah humbled
[1:32:06] himself and became a man represented in
[1:32:08] sinful flesh to redeem you and me who
[1:32:11] are we then he was our example who am I
[1:32:15] nothing I think this is so important
[1:32:17] because brother benam says he was our
[1:32:19] example but to be a Christian what life
[1:32:22] is supposed to live in US
[1:32:24] that same life so that example life we
[1:32:28] can only live by the same life that was
[1:32:31] in him if it's in us that's the only way
[1:32:34] that we can live that example life we
[1:32:36] can't do it of our own effort and our
[1:32:38] own willpower and our own trying it
[1:32:40] actually takes the Life of Christ that
[1:32:42] lived it the first time to come and live
[1:32:44] it in us this time that's the only way
[1:32:46] we can be a Christian is to have that
[1:32:48] Life of Christ in
[1:32:51] us and then we have this this thought
[1:32:54] who am I if Christ can humble himself
[1:32:57] that way if he can be criticized if he
[1:32:59] can be rejected if he can have no place
[1:33:00] and he keeps doing the he keeps obeying
[1:33:02] the word and he keeps doing the will of
[1:33:03] the father then what's my excuse who am
[1:33:06] I paragraph 162 I was telling someone
[1:33:09] this afternoon in a little meeting I
[1:33:10] said every son that's born of God has to
[1:33:12] be tried first chastened I remember when
[1:33:16] I had mine or my greatest
[1:33:19] hour when a man is born I'm sorry when I
[1:33:22] had remember when I had mine or my
[1:33:24] greatest ER yes when a man is born again
[1:33:26] there's a little spot like the size of
[1:33:28] his fingernail that God injects into him
[1:33:30] system and it falls into his heart and
[1:33:32] their anchors then Satan makes him prove
[1:33:35] it and if that ain't there you're
[1:33:39] gone lock in on that now brother B says
[1:33:43] something comes into you the Life of
[1:33:45] Christ comes into you at the new birth
[1:33:47] and he then he says and Satan makes you
[1:33:50] prove that so let's not get discouraged
[1:33:53] when Satan starts making us prove
[1:33:55] it but listen what he says if that ain't
[1:33:58] there you're gone we will never stand
[1:34:02] the proving time or the testing time
[1:34:04] unless the actual life of Christ is in
[1:34:06] US amen no human life can make it amen
[1:34:11] no human life can make it then he starts
[1:34:14] to talk about his testing time and he
[1:34:15] starts to go back to the death of his
[1:34:17] brother the death of his father and the
[1:34:20] trial that that brought on him because
[1:34:22] he's preaching Divine Healing he's he's
[1:34:23] preaching God is great God's A Healer
[1:34:25] and he's being rejected all over but
[1:34:27] he's preaching the gospel and now his
[1:34:29] brother dies his father dies in his arms
[1:34:31] his wife dies and then he gets a call to
[1:34:33] the hospital that his baby's dying and
[1:34:35] brother M starts to share with us that
[1:34:37] he's crying out to God and let's go to
[1:34:40] page 33 and pick it up
[1:34:46] there he said he paragraph 171 he just
[1:34:50] pulled down the curtain as if to say
[1:34:51] shut up I don't want to hear you at all
[1:34:54] he wouldn't even talk to me then if he
[1:34:57] wouldn't talk to me it was Satan's time
[1:34:59] he said I thought you said he was a good
[1:35:01] God that's all this you're hollering
[1:35:03] about you're just a boy look around over
[1:35:05] the city every girl every boy you ever
[1:35:07] associated with think you've lost your
[1:35:09] mind you have now he couldn't tell me
[1:35:12] there's no God cuz I had already seen it
[1:35:14] but he told me he didn't care for me
[1:35:16] said all night long all day long I said
[1:35:19] that to god what have I done show me
[1:35:20] Lord don't let the innocent have to
[1:35:22] suffer for me if I done wrong
[1:35:24] I didn't know he was trying me but every
[1:35:27] son that comes to God has got to be
[1:35:32] tried
[1:35:35] amen I just want to bring this to your
[1:35:39] attention the question is what is being
[1:35:42] tried what's really being
[1:35:45] tried what's being tried is your sonship
[1:35:48] yeah what is your sunship it's his life
[1:35:52] in you amen so what is really being
[1:35:55] tested and tried in our lives friends in
[1:35:57] our darkest hour it's actually Christ
[1:35:59] being tried because it's our sunship
[1:36:02] being tried amen and only the Life of
[1:36:05] Christ will will make it through the
[1:36:07] trial amen it's not your flesh being
[1:36:10] tried because your flesh will fail it's
[1:36:12] not your Humanity it's not you as a
[1:36:14] human being that's not being tested
[1:36:16] because that will fail hands down but
[1:36:18] what's being tested is that every son
[1:36:21] that comes to God must be chasen and
[1:36:24] tested so what's he testing our sunship
[1:36:27] in
[1:36:28] only that relationship to God only
[1:36:31] Christ's life only his life in us will
[1:36:34] make it through the test amen that's
[1:36:37] what the prophet's teaching us this is
[1:36:40] not a grit your teeth and do better
[1:36:43] message this is a surrender and let his
[1:36:45] life flow through US message cuz we
[1:36:48] can't do it ourselves friends should we
[1:36:51] try yeah we should try but all our
[1:36:53] trying going to Mountain failures we
[1:36:55] should do our part but without his life
[1:36:57] we'll never make it let's go to the top
[1:36:59] of P page
[1:37:02] 34 said then I began to listen to him
[1:37:05] that's reasoning I thought that's
[1:37:07] right he he said he can tell he don't
[1:37:11] have to speak the word just look to your
[1:37:13] baby and it would live and I said that's
[1:37:15] right brother B said now this Satan's is
[1:37:17] working on his reasoning and his human
[1:37:20] reasoning is agreeing with the devil
[1:37:23] right that's right and as much as you've
[1:37:25] done for him and yet that's what he does
[1:37:28] for you I said that's right I begin to
[1:37:30] think well what see everything begin to
[1:37:32] break away when it come to reasonings so
[1:37:35] he was as a human being in his reasoning
[1:37:38] mind he was falling apart he was losing
[1:37:41] faith he was he was about ready to walk
[1:37:44] away but then he says but then but when
[1:37:47] it come to that see how that's
[1:37:50] capitalized in your book that's the
[1:37:52] Eternal part heart when it come to that
[1:37:55] that hung it stayed there I was just
[1:37:58] about ready to say then I'll quit but
[1:38:00] when it got down to all the reasoning
[1:38:02] Powers had broke away then it come to
[1:38:05] down to that eternal life that new birth
[1:38:08] what if it hadn't been
[1:38:10] there you tell me what would have
[1:38:12] happened if hadn't been there he would
[1:38:13] have collapsed under that
[1:38:15] trial the only thing that got him
[1:38:17] through the trial was the life of Jesus
[1:38:19] Christ on the inside of
[1:38:21] him what if it hadn't what if it hadn't
[1:38:25] have we wouldn't have known one another
[1:38:27] the way we do now this church would not
[1:38:29] be here like this the thousands and
[1:38:31] millions around the world but thank God
[1:38:33] it was there then when I thought what
[1:38:37] who am I anyhow who am I to question his
[1:38:40] majesty who am I to question the Creator
[1:38:43] that give me my very life here on Earth
[1:38:45] where did I get that baby who give it to
[1:38:47] me not mine anyhow he just lered to me
[1:38:50] for a while I said Satan you get away
[1:38:52] from me I want went over I laid my hands
[1:38:54] on the baby I said God bless you
[1:38:56] sweetheart in a minute daddy will take
[1:38:58] you down and put you on mommy's arms the
[1:39:00] angels will pack your little soul away
[1:39:02] and I'll meet you in the morning I said
[1:39:04] Lord you give her to me you're taking
[1:39:07] her away though you slay me like job
[1:39:09] said yet I love you and I believe you if
[1:39:12] you send me to hell I'll love you anyhow
[1:39:14] I can't get away from that there you are
[1:39:17] just if just been intellectual it had
[1:39:20] all broke away but you got to have
[1:39:22] personal relation relationship you've
[1:39:24] got to be born
[1:39:27] again listen if it had just been
[1:39:30] teaching and instruction from a church
[1:39:32] on how to handle trials and who God is
[1:39:35] and you're nobody any if it had just
[1:39:38] been
[1:39:39] instruction it would have fallen away
[1:39:42] the only thing that held was that new
[1:39:45] born New Birth Born Again life on the
[1:39:48] inside that's the only thing that
[1:39:51] held praise God and it's the only only
[1:39:53] thing that'll hold you and I
[1:39:55] friends and I thank God for it I would
[1:39:58] have been discouraged and walked away a
[1:40:00] long time ago if there wasn't something
[1:40:02] more than intellectual if there wasn't
[1:40:04] something more than my flesh and my
[1:40:06] willpower and my strength and good
[1:40:08] teaching there had to been something
[1:40:09] more than all of that friends because
[1:40:11] there Comes A Time all the good teaching
[1:40:13] that you got there's a there's a there's
[1:40:15] a master Reasoner that can out reason
[1:40:17] all of your instruction amen but there's
[1:40:20] something deeper than reasoning and
[1:40:22] deeper than the mind and it's God's life
[1:40:26] amen last thing I would like to read to
[1:40:28] you at the bottom of page
[1:40:30] 36 if you can turn to paragraph 190 at
[1:40:33] the bottom of page
[1:40:35] 36 said I want to hold that word a
[1:40:37] minute though they call themselves
[1:40:39] Christian they adopt Creeds man-made
[1:40:41] Creeds to take the place of God's word
[1:40:43] so they can take the Creed because the
[1:40:45] man M because man made it but they're
[1:40:47] afraid to lay their faith out there in
[1:40:49] in the god that they claim that they
[1:40:51] love that's right and when you say that
[1:40:53] the life then you say that that life is
[1:40:56] worthy of the Gospel can't be though
[1:40:58] they be church members but that's not
[1:41:00] worthy of the Gospel no indeedy the
[1:41:03] gospel Jesus said go into all the world
[1:41:05] and preach the gospel to Every Creature
[1:41:06] these signs shall follow the Believers
[1:41:08] and when you deny that to follow the
[1:41:10] Believers how can you have a life no
[1:41:13] matter listen you might not never say a
[1:41:16] bad word you might keep all the Ten
[1:41:18] Commandments that won't have that won't
[1:41:20] have one thing to do with it it's still
[1:41:22] not worthy of the Gospel see it couldn't
[1:41:25] be those priests kept that and still was
[1:41:28] not worthy he said you are of your
[1:41:30] father the devil who could lay a finger
[1:41:32] on one of them men one guilty Mark and
[1:41:34] they were stoned without Mercy holy men
[1:41:37] and Jesus said you're of your father the
[1:41:38] devil when the gospel came into it so
[1:41:42] you find out friends it's not just
[1:41:44] keeping the Commandments right because
[1:41:47] the priest kept the
[1:41:50] Commandments it's got to be a life on
[1:41:52] the inside
[1:41:54] if you would turn with me in your Bibles
[1:41:55] I want to read one scripture as the
[1:41:57] musicians come and as brother Blake
[1:41:59] comes let's turn to Matthew n Matthew
[1:42:12] 19 Matthew
[1:42:15] 19:20 this is the story of the Rich
[1:42:17] Young Ruler who come to Jesus and wanted
[1:42:20] to know what good works he must do to
[1:42:22] inherit a eternal
[1:42:24] life and in verse 20 Jesus says it says
[1:42:27] the young man saith unto him all these
[1:42:29] things have I kept from my youth up what
[1:42:31] lack I yet so he asked Jesus what must I
[1:42:34] do to inherit eternal life he said you
[1:42:36] know the Commandments honor thy father
[1:42:37] and mother do this do this keep the
[1:42:41] Commandments and this young man says all
[1:42:43] of these have I kept from my youth up
[1:42:46] yet what do I lack Jesus said unto him
[1:42:49] if thou wil be perfect go and sell that
[1:42:51] thou Hast and give to the poor and thou
[1:42:53] shal have treasure in heaven and come
[1:42:55] and follow me but when the young man
[1:42:57] heard that saying he went away sorrowful
[1:42:59] for he had great
[1:43:01] possessions and we find though this man
[1:43:04] had kept all the
[1:43:07] Commandments he had an excuse that he
[1:43:10] couldn't he couldn't heed the
[1:43:13] invitation what did we just read in the
[1:43:15] Bible Jesus gave him an invitation sell
[1:43:18] all that you have and come and follow me
[1:43:19] that was his visitation that was his
[1:43:22] invitation that was his
[1:43:24] opportunity and when he had an excuse
[1:43:27] and he walked away we find that man in
[1:43:31] Hell lifting up his
[1:43:33] eyes he had kept all the Commandments
[1:43:36] but keeping the Commandments is not
[1:43:38] enough it's got to be Christ's life in
[1:43:42] us it's got to be a born again
[1:43:44] experience and that life in us well how
[1:43:47] do you know you're a Christian every
[1:43:49] word that he wrote and everything that
[1:43:51] he said something in you says Amen to it
[1:43:54] not from the mind but something deeper
[1:43:56] says Amen to it and then begins to
[1:43:58] produce that life amen let's all Stand
[1:44:05] Together say thank you
[1:44:07] Lord having a life worthy of the Gospel
[1:44:09] is not something that you and I can do
[1:44:11] on our own that's right having a life
[1:44:14] worthy of the Gospel is being able to
[1:44:16] accept the invitation and that comes by
[1:44:18] pre the predestinated will of God and
[1:44:21] I'm so thankful when the IM ation come
[1:44:23] my way there was something deeper than
[1:44:25] my intellect cuz my intellect was
[1:44:27] screaming no but something inside of me
[1:44:30] said that sounds true God be praised
[1:44:34] amen
[1:44:38] than oh teach me thy
