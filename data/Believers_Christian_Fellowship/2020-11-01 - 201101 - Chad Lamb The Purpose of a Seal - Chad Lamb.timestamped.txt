[6:37] time away
[6:38] but it's good to be home it's good to be

[7:02] with us
[7:03] man we're going to start this morning
[7:04] off doing something we love to do
[7:06] we're going to dedicate a little baby so
[7:09] brother ben and sister amanda want to
[7:11] bring up little banaya ray
[7:13] little banaya ray sibolt benign means
[7:17] built by god amen that's a good way to
[7:19] be built
[7:20] and ray means advisor or protector
[7:24] and this little boy he's going to have
[7:26] to live up to his namesake
[7:28] he didn't kill dear banaya then he went
[7:30] down in a pit on a snowy day and killed
[7:32] a lion brother
[7:34] so this boy might do you up
[7:39] amen
[7:43] praise the lord
[7:46] amen it's such a blessing to hold this
[7:48] little baby
[7:50] in the know what god has done for this
[7:52] couple
[7:53] who was told that they couldn't have a
[7:55] child that to be a miracle she became
[7:58] pregnant and in three years three babies
[8:02] i told sister amanda when god fixes
[8:05] something he does a good job
[8:08] and this is bower heads and pray lord
[8:11] jesus
[8:12] we thank you so much lord for your
[8:14] goodness to us
[8:16] for this little life that i hold in my
[8:17] hands lord if you were here you would
[8:20] take the children into yourself and
[8:21] bless them
[8:22] by standing here in your stead as your
[8:24] prophet told us to
[8:25] to take this little child lord and bless
[8:28] it
[8:29] well we pray as mother and father have
[8:31] come down lord not for a tradition and
[8:33] not for a show
[8:34] but they've come down in sincerity lord
[8:36] to give this life back to you that
[8:38] you've placed in their hands
[8:40] they're merely stewards over this life i
[8:42] pray you'd give them wisdom
[8:43] that they'd be faithful in their office
[8:45] as a mother and a father over this
[8:46] little life
[8:48] that benigha would know what it's like
[8:49] to feel the presence of the holy spirit
[8:51] in his home
[8:52] where he would dwell in a place lord
[8:54] where your word is upheld
[8:56] and guarded that word would find place
[8:58] in his heart while he's young lord
[9:00] that he wouldn't have to go the way of
[9:01] the world and suffer
[9:03] the god that he would know you from his
[9:04] youth on god we pray you bless mother
[9:07] and father
[9:08] with wisdom ability strength and
[9:10] blessings
[9:12] and bless us as we stand by them to
[9:13] support them as they raise this child
[9:15] for your glory
[9:16] in jesus name we pray amen
[9:25] amen god bless you amen
[9:29] praise the lord i hope i'm not losing my
[9:33] touch with babies
[9:36] he was a little fussy let's all stand
[9:39] and we'll go to the word
[9:41] amen i pray that you guys bear with me
[9:44] brother branham said preaching something
[9:46] you got to stay with and you get you get
[9:47] out of it
[9:48] when he said that he had been i think
[9:49] two or three months without preaching
[9:51] i've been two weeks but
[9:54] i was nervous in the back and i said my
[9:56] goodness
[9:58] i'm always a little nervous but now i
[10:00] feel like i forgot how to preach
[10:02] so you're going to have to pull and i
[10:04] have extra sympathy for the brothers i
[10:06] remember the day when you would preach
[10:07] and maybe go weeks or months
[10:09] and preach again and always are you
[10:11] ready you're not ready and then you're
[10:12] called upon and you thought you had
[10:14] plenty of time to get ready and you had
[10:16] a month or two and then all of a sudden
[10:17] there's never enough time
[10:19] and then i feel the same way and then
[10:21] when we went away we were able to just
[10:23] completely disconnect and
[10:25] we listened to some services and i read
[10:28] some in the breach which we'll talk
[10:29] about a bit today
[10:30] but i was just preaching for pleasure
[10:32] not for study and so yesterday i had to
[10:34] switch gears and i was like whoa
[10:36] that's a different gear all together so
[10:39] just pray for us
[10:41] let's turn to second timothy chapter two
[10:44] and we'll begin reading there together i
[10:46] also want to remind you that today is a
[10:48] communion service sunday so we'll be
[10:50] coming back this afternoon for communion
[10:52] and so it'll be a pleasure to take that
[10:54] together this afternoon
[10:57] second timothy chapter 2 verse
[11:02] 19. ii timothy 2 and 19
[11:07] nevertheless the foundation of god stand
[11:09] ashore
[11:10] having this seal the lord knoweth them
[11:13] that are his
[11:15] oh what a scripture friends let's read
[11:17] that again nevertheless the foundation
[11:19] of god stand asher
[11:21] having this seal the lord knoweth them
[11:25] that are his let everyone that name with
[11:27] the name of christ depart from iniquity
[11:30] let's bow our heads and pray lord jesus
[11:32] we thank you for your word
[11:34] lord it means so much to us and god
[11:37] we're so thankful and grateful that we
[11:39] can gather back together like this
[11:41] having my family and i've been separated
[11:43] for a couple weeks
[11:45] notice we come back together lord defeat
[11:47] upon your word
[11:48] with a full heart and happiness lord
[11:50] with joy that we get to gather together
[11:52] with the saints that we hold so dear
[11:54] that we love so much we pray god that
[11:57] you would now
[11:58] lord in your love for us feed us from
[12:00] your own hand your own word lord
[12:02] that we might be strengthened lord by it
[12:05] that we might journey in this life in a
[12:06] way that's pleasing to you
[12:08] give us i salve to see in hearts to
[12:10] perceive and understand
[12:12] all that you have for us in this hour
[12:13] that we live we ask your blessing and
[12:16] your preeminence
[12:17] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[12:20] you can all be seated and
[12:24] today i'd like to talk on the topic the
[12:27] subject the purpose of a seal
[12:29] and maybe take it from two different
[12:32] angles we'll see as we go on
[12:34] but when we look at the scripture in ii
[12:35] timothy
[12:37] he's saying nevertheless the foundation
[12:39] of god saying that sure having this seal
[12:41] amen and the word seal here is very
[12:45] similar through all the usages in the
[12:46] new testament this is where seal is
[12:48] simply just a seal
[12:50] a seal placed on a book or on a scroll
[12:52] or
[12:53] or any document uh a signet ring because
[12:55] the signet ring oftentimes is what makes
[12:57] the impression on the seal
[12:59] that seals it so it's the article that
[13:01] makes the seal or the impression on the
[13:03] seal
[13:03] or the seal itself and also
[13:07] the inscription impression made by a
[13:09] seal and then the last definition
[13:12] that they put here in the concordance
[13:14] that by which anything is confirmed
[13:17] proved authenticated as by a seal a
[13:20] token
[13:20] or a proof so it's something that has
[13:23] been sealed
[13:24] sealed by some body sealed by a signet
[13:27] ring
[13:28] or something like that it's something
[13:29] that's sealed or preserved
[13:31] or kept or or
[13:34] locked in held in confidence but it's
[13:37] anything that is confirmed authenticated
[13:40] as by a seal
[13:42] so nevertheless the foundation of god
[13:44] stands as sure having this seal
[13:46] having this confirmation having this
[13:48] authentication
[13:49] that the lord knoweth them that are his
[13:52] amen
[13:53] and he'll not lose on one of them this
[13:55] is the seal this
[13:56] is the the seal that we're under is that
[13:59] god knows us
[14:01] and god's always known us before the
[14:03] foundation of the world when we come to
[14:04] this life with spiritual amnesia
[14:06] the foundation of god was sure having
[14:08] this seal this
[14:10] affirmation this authentication that he
[14:12] knew you
[14:14] it wasn't about what you knew amen
[14:16] because all along he knew you
[14:18] and at some day in a given point in time
[14:20] when god declared he would allow you to
[14:22] know him also amen
[14:24] but he knew you and that's the
[14:25] authentication what is my authentication
[14:28] he knew me from before the foundation of
[14:31] the world
[14:32] i mean let's look at a couple other
[14:34] seals let's go to revelation chapter
[14:35] five
[14:36] and we'll look at the sealed book this
[14:39] is one of my favorites and
[14:42] the subject that we can never get away
[14:44] from because this is the day we live in
[14:47] this is not a subject that we get away
[14:48] from the book of redemption
[14:51] the lamb taking the book and breaking
[14:53] the seals it's not a subject we move
[14:54] beyond
[14:56] it's not a subject that we're done with
[14:57] this is the subject for the day that we
[14:59] live in
[15:01] revelation chapter 5 verse 1 and i saw
[15:04] on the right hand of him that sat on the
[15:06] throne a book
[15:07] written within and on the backside
[15:09] sealed with seven seals
[15:11] and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a
[15:13] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[15:15] book and to loose the seals thereof
[15:18] and no man in heaven nor on earth
[15:19] neither under the earth was able to open
[15:21] the book neither to look thereon
[15:24] and i wept much because no man was found
[15:26] worthy to open
[15:27] and to read the book neither to look
[15:29] thereon and one of the elders saith unto
[15:32] me weep not behold the lion of the tribe
[15:34] of judah the root of david
[15:36] hath prevailed to open the book and to
[15:38] loose the seven seals
[15:40] thereof and i beheld and lo in the midst
[15:42] of the throne and of the four beasts and
[15:44] in the midst of the elder stood a lamb
[15:46] as it had been slain having seven horns
[15:48] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[15:50] of god sent forth unto all the earth
[15:53] and he came and took the book out of the
[15:54] right hand of him that sat upon the
[15:56] throne
[15:58] and when he had taken the book and the
[15:59] four beasts and four and twenty elders
[16:02] fell down before the lamb having every
[16:04] one of them
[16:05] every one of them harps and golden vials
[16:07] full of odors which are the prayers of
[16:08] the saints
[16:09] and they sung a new song saying thou art
[16:11] worthy to take the book
[16:12] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[16:15] was slain
[16:16] and has redeemed us to god by thy blood
[16:18] out of every kindred
[16:19] and tongue and people a nation and has
[16:22] made us unto
[16:23] our god kings and priests and we shall
[16:26] reign
[16:27] on the earth so we see we have a
[16:30] sealed book and these are things that
[16:32] are so very familiar to us we're not
[16:34] looking to launch into the unfamiliar
[16:36] but we're looking to
[16:38] to to enjoy the familiar
[16:41] but the the there's a sealed book amen
[16:44] that
[16:45] is signified in heaven and we realize
[16:47] and we look at the book of genesis and
[16:49] also the book of revelation these are
[16:51] books of symbols
[16:52] and so we don't want to if we get too
[16:56] fixated on symbols and hold to the
[16:58] symbol
[16:59] when brother branham begins to change
[17:01] terminology about that symbol we don't
[17:03] catch the change
[17:05] because it has to be you know if we look
[17:08] at the book of redemption
[17:09] this is just for an example if we look
[17:11] at the book of redemption and we take
[17:12] what brother brahm says and what we see
[17:14] here
[17:14] we see seven scrolls rolled together our
[17:17] brother bam says
[17:18] six books scrolled together either way
[17:20] you see these scrolls rolled together
[17:21] and
[17:22] you see a seal fixed to one amen another
[17:24] one rolling and another seal and you
[17:26] break one seal and roll one and you
[17:27] break a ceiling you roll another
[17:29] and then you get in your mind that what
[17:32] is actually in heaven
[17:33] is paper rolled up with seals put on it
[17:37] and then when brother branham says what
[17:38] is those seals he says what is those
[17:40] seals those seals are christ
[17:42] then he says what is that book that book
[17:44] is the bible no it's
[17:46] six rolled up pieces of paper we said no
[17:49] amen
[17:49] this is symbology brother branham's
[17:51] trying to show us that there's a mystery
[17:53] hidden there's something that's been
[17:55] sealed
[17:55] from the foundation of the world and
[17:57] that mystery whatever is on
[17:59] that book whatever is on that document
[18:01] whatever mystery whatever truth
[18:03] is laid behind that seal is waiting for
[18:06] certain conditions to be met
[18:07] amen that's shown by the seals and
[18:09] looking for a certain one
[18:11] in this passage that's been found worthy
[18:14] because the question is what man is
[18:16] there a man found worthy man
[18:18] who is worthy to open the book the cry
[18:20] went out who is worthy to open the book
[18:23] and no man in heaven no man on earth no
[18:25] man under the earth
[18:26] showing that the only one that could be
[18:28] worthy had to be a man
[18:30] because this was a book that was given
[18:31] to man
[18:33] and brother said this book went back to
[18:35] god to the original
[18:37] owner amen but the book was intended to
[18:40] be in the hands of man
[18:43] and you know adam long brother said adam
[18:45] lost this title deed he lost this book
[18:49] but adam was not walking around the
[18:51] garden with a book under his arm
[18:55] he realized that he wasn't walking
[18:56] around the garden and watching after his
[18:58] book and holding his book
[19:00] and tasting of this tree and and then
[19:02] and naming the animals with a book under
[19:04] his hand
[19:07] so when he lost the book and it went
[19:09] back to the original owner it's been in
[19:10] the hand of the original owner
[19:12] amen it's not talking about transfers of
[19:14] paperwork
[19:17] but it's this truth that's been hidden
[19:19] it's this reality
[19:20] of god this mystery of god that god had
[19:22] had in his heart amen adam had it
[19:25] and adam lost it and when adam lost it
[19:27] it went to god
[19:28] waiting for a man who could redeem back
[19:30] what adam lost
[19:31] because what adam was given was total
[19:33] dominion over creation
[19:35] as of god on the earth and that was
[19:38] lost and it was an exchange of paperwork
[19:41] amen
[19:41] it was the it was the it was the mystery
[19:44] of god
[19:45] that was in adam and adam's wife had
[19:47] been lost by the fall
[19:49] that mystery went back to god and it
[19:50] went into obscurity
[19:52] as man tried to make his own way and
[19:54] find god through his own devices and
[19:56] and some could wait for revelation
[19:58] others started forming religion
[20:02] and it got obscured and it got muddled
[20:04] and it got mixed until
[20:05] it was obscure amen but there was a book
[20:08] sealed
[20:09] and then from the very beginning that
[20:11] had seven seals on it
[20:13] that held the mystery of what was in
[20:15] god's mind from before the foundation of
[20:17] the world
[20:17] amen so that the truth would never get
[20:19] lost no matter how many ideas man came
[20:22] up with
[20:23] no matter how many religions he formed
[20:25] no matter how many towers he built
[20:26] no matter how many worldwide religions
[20:28] he came up with amen there was a truth
[20:30] that was holding
[20:31] in the hand of god god was not going to
[20:34] lose this mystery truth
[20:37] he was not allowed he was not going to
[20:39] allow his great plan his great heart
[20:41] desire
[20:42] his great mystery to be lost he held it
[20:45] in his hand
[20:46] until there was a man who could come and
[20:48] take it out of his hand
[20:50] because god was going to make sure this
[20:52] wasn't lost
[20:55] and so there was a man amen christ jesus
[20:57] when god came himself in the form of a
[20:59] man
[21:00] and then he became his own son and he
[21:02] came and he lived this life
[21:03] and then he died amen to pay the price
[21:06] of redemption and it's why
[21:07] when he calls for a lion of the tribe of
[21:09] judah to prevail
[21:10] he sees a bleeding lamb because that's
[21:12] how he overcome
[21:14] that's how he prevailed by paying the
[21:16] price of redemption to buy
[21:18] back amen the right to this book
[21:22] now realize we're not talking about
[21:24] paper
[21:26] this is symbolism
[21:30] symbolism
[21:33] let's turn to revelations 10.
[21:43] revelations 10 verse 1
[21:48] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[21:51] from heaven
[21:52] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[21:55] upon his head
[21:56] and his face was as it were the sun and
[21:58] his feet as a pillar of fire
[22:00] and he had in his hand a little book
[22:02] open
[22:03] there was a book closed and brother ben
[22:05] said this is the same book
[22:08] it's closed in chapter five it's open in
[22:10] chapter 10.
[22:11] so now there's an open book
[22:14] and he says and he set his right foot
[22:17] upon the sea and his left foot upon the
[22:19] earth
[22:19] and cried with the loud voices when a
[22:21] lion roareth and when he had cried seven
[22:23] thunders under the voices
[22:24] and when the seven thunders had uttered
[22:26] their voices i was about to write
[22:28] and i heard a voice from heaven saying
[22:30] unto me seal up those things which the
[22:32] seven
[22:32] thunders uttered and write them not so
[22:35] here we see another seal
[22:38] only this seal is not written on paper
[22:41] because he wrote them not so there's
[22:45] there's seven thunders and those seven
[22:46] thunders uttered something
[22:48] and we know what the seven thunders
[22:49] uttered was the revelation of what the
[22:51] mysteries were
[22:53] but john heard it and john understood it
[22:55] and john was going to write it
[22:57] but he was told don't write it but seal
[23:00] it up
[23:00] so how do you seal it up if it's not
[23:02] written we're not talking about paper
[23:06] because he would have no paper because
[23:07] he was told not to write it
[23:10] but yet to seal it up amen
[23:14] now he told him to seal it up not throw
[23:17] it away
[23:19] this is so important to seal it not to
[23:22] discard it
[23:24] to seal it because when something is
[23:27] sealed
[23:28] amen the fact that it's sealed denotes
[23:31] that there is a time for it to be
[23:33] unsealed or there's no reason to seal it
[23:36] because if you don't ever want the
[23:38] contents to ever be revealed
[23:40] you would just bury it burn it destroy
[23:43] it
[23:44] get rid of it but the fact that you seal
[23:46] it is proof
[23:47] evidence that there's a reason that
[23:50] you're holding
[23:51] this information special and sealed
[23:54] authenticated
[23:55] and then sealed treasured kept
[23:58] whatever you wanted whatever term you
[24:00] would like to use
[24:01] there's a reason that whatever was
[24:03] written down here or whatever was
[24:05] spoken and understood but not written
[24:09] because you seal things that sometimes
[24:11] are not even written
[24:13] the seven thunders if you seal it
[24:17] then you've guaranteed that there's a
[24:19] reason
[24:20] amen for it to be preserved
[24:25] or else there's no reason to seal it
[24:28] that's why when you say
[24:29] well it's sealed up it's not for us to
[24:31] know if it's sealed up it's for somebody
[24:34] to know that's reason there's a seal
[24:36] upon it
[24:38] amen well it's sealed up you know don't
[24:41] try to go there it's sealed up
[24:42] uh that's not for you to know oh then
[24:44] who's it for to know because the seal
[24:46] means it's for somebody to know
[24:53] it's like of a man he writes down some
[24:55] last wishes and
[24:56] and some things he would like to to have
[24:59] done with his estate when he dies he
[25:01] may write a will he may write some
[25:03] letters to some family and he seals in
[25:04] an envelope and he seals it on the
[25:06] outside he denotes
[25:07] amen that this is a sealed envelope do
[25:09] not open till my death
[25:13] well if he didn't want anybody to know
[25:15] what was in there he would have just
[25:16] burnt the document
[25:17] not sealed it he sealed it because it's
[25:19] meant for somebody
[25:21] to know what is inside that envelope
[25:24] and god amen sealed the mystery because
[25:26] there was going to come a time
[25:28] that somebody needs to know what's in
[25:30] this book
[25:32] it's not going to forever remain sealed
[25:34] amen there
[25:36] there's a time for the sealed book to
[25:37] open and friends
[25:39] i personally i know because of what the
[25:42] prophet said
[25:42] but god never intended for that to be
[25:44] sealed and held and never revealed
[25:47] until after we get a body change and we
[25:49] come into perfection and we're known
[25:50] he's never known and we go into heaven
[25:52] amen and then god's going to tell us
[25:54] what he wouldn't tell us on earth
[25:55] well what's the point we've already
[25:57] arrived
[26:00] amen it wasn't sealed up for then amen
[26:03] it's sealed up amen
[26:04] it sealed up for it was given to adam
[26:07] not when adam was an attribute in god it
[26:10] was given to adam
[26:11] not when you know not when he was just a
[26:13] thought in god it was given to adam when
[26:15] he come to the earth to rule and reign
[26:16] upon the earth
[26:19] so this book has something to do with
[26:20] creation
[26:22] and this book has something to do with
[26:25] with god
[26:26] amen in creation god's sons
[26:29] in creation so it's not just for the
[26:32] heavenly realm
[26:35] it's for earth as well that's why i
[26:37] don't think it's just for when we
[26:39] get over there then he's going to open
[26:41] that book and show us the contents
[26:44] i'm already there
[26:48] there's a reason that it's sealed
[26:52] let's go back to daniel
[27:00] if we could go to daniel chapter 12.
[27:12] daniel 12 and we'll start at verse 8.
[27:20] which means i have to turn the page
[27:22] daniel 12
[27:23] 8 and i heard but i understood not then
[27:26] said i
[27:27] owe my lord what shall be the end of
[27:29] these things
[27:30] and he said go thy way daniel for the
[27:32] words are closed up and sealed
[27:34] till the time of the end
[27:37] hallelujah so daniel also
[27:40] saw something daniel also heard
[27:42] something but he didn't have the
[27:44] revelation
[27:45] or the understanding and he asked for it
[27:47] he said daniel go your way
[27:48] it's not for you this will be sealed up
[27:50] until the time
[27:52] of the end so at the end time amen
[27:55] whatever was sealed amen is going to be
[27:58] unsealed there's a seal
[28:01] affixed and the seal is affixed for a
[28:03] time but there's a time appointed for
[28:05] the seal to come off
[28:06] amen and when the seal comes off amen it
[28:09] it's for a purpose it's for a reason
[28:12] he said verse 10 many shall be purified
[28:14] when at the end time and the time of the
[28:16] opening of the seal
[28:17] many shall be purified and made white
[28:19] and tried
[28:20] but the wicked shall do wickedly and
[28:22] none of the wicked shall understand
[28:24] but the wise shall understand
[28:27] so even when the time when it comes time
[28:30] for the time of the end for the time
[28:32] that what daniel was not permitted to
[28:33] know what was sealed up into the time of
[28:35] the end
[28:36] when it comes time that end time
[28:39] for that seal to be whatever was sealed
[28:42] to now be unveiled or open or known
[28:44] amen it's going to be the same time that
[28:47] many are purified
[28:48] and made white and tried
[28:52] tested refined
[28:56] but the wicked shall do wickedly and
[28:58] none of the wicked shall understand
[29:00] this is interesting but the wise shall
[29:04] understand
[29:05] why because he's going to open the seal
[29:09] at the time of the end what was sealed
[29:10] up to daniel is going to be open
[29:12] and when it's open amen when it's opened
[29:16] it's still hid
[29:19] because none of the wicked will
[29:20] understand although it's open
[29:23] [Music]
[29:24] so amen it's sealed
[29:28] it's unsealed and at the same time it's
[29:31] unsealed it's still sealed
[29:35] this is why god operates by revelation
[29:38] because by revelation he can
[29:39] clearly say something amen and only the
[29:42] ones who are intended to hear it with a
[29:43] spirit in them to receive revelation
[29:45] will know what he says the rest will
[29:47] remain in darkness
[29:49] same thing happened when jesus christ
[29:50] was here in flesh amen he was here and
[29:53] he would speak
[29:54] something and he would say it clearly
[29:55] amen only they would not hear it they
[29:57] would not understand they would hear it
[29:59] but they would not understand it amen it
[30:01] was still sealed to them
[30:03] even many things he said to his
[30:05] disciples remained sealed to his
[30:07] disciples until after the resurrection
[30:09] and then with the gift of the holy ghost
[30:10] they remembered what he had said
[30:13] and remembered the scriptures
[30:16] because it takes revelation amen it
[30:19] takes revelation
[30:20] to understand what's laying behind the
[30:23] broke seal
[30:28] the wicked won't understand but the wise
[30:32] they shall understand brother branham
[30:36] and the mess in the breach message he
[30:38] says there's three things that
[30:40] that a seal denotes there's three things
[30:42] that a seal denotes
[30:44] and i'm not going to do them in the
[30:45] order he does them in the breach but i'm
[30:47] going to
[30:47] rearrange it my own order the first i
[30:49] want to talk about is ownership
[30:52] in the breach message he says another
[30:54] thing a seal signifies his ownership
[30:56] see the seal has a mark on it shows
[30:59] ownership
[30:59] when you're brought bought by the blood
[31:01] of jesus christ and sealed by the holy
[31:03] ghost you are no longer belong to the
[31:05] world or anything pertaining to the
[31:07] world
[31:07] you are owned by god
[31:10] but brother branham now when he starts
[31:12] talking here in the breach
[31:13] he's going to talk about these three
[31:14] things that a seal denotes and he's
[31:16] going to be speaking
[31:18] uh on two levels he's going to be
[31:20] talking about your personal seal when
[31:22] you're sealed by the holy ghost in the
[31:23] new birth
[31:24] but he's also going to be referring back
[31:25] to this book that's sealed because if
[31:27] you understand in the breach he's
[31:29] talking about revelation chapter
[31:31] uh four moving into chapter five talking
[31:33] about the breach between the seven
[31:34] church ages
[31:35] which is revelation chapter two and
[31:37] three and the seven seals
[31:38] which begin in revelation chapter six
[31:40] and he's talking about the breach which
[31:42] this
[31:42] is these verses in between primarily
[31:44] chapter five
[31:46] so when brother is talking about
[31:48] revelation or the breach he is talking
[31:50] about this sealed book
[31:52] he's talking about this scene in heaven
[31:54] where a lamb comes and takes the book
[31:56] the book that's sealed that no man's
[31:57] worthy to touch it or to look there on
[32:00] amen but he's been found worthy that's
[32:01] what brother brahm's talking about
[32:03] so now when he gets into seal when he
[32:04] starts talking about these three things
[32:06] that a seal denotes he's talking about
[32:08] you individually under your seal of the
[32:09] holy ghost but he's also talking about
[32:11] this book
[32:12] so i'd like to talk about both as well
[32:14] let's go to acts chapter 20. i want to
[32:16] read several scriptures so keep your
[32:18] bibles
[32:18] handy and get your fast flipper on
[32:22] and we'll go through several scriptures
[32:23] here acts chapter 20
[32:27] verse 28
[32:38] take heed therefore unto yourselves
[32:40] until all the flock over which the holy
[32:41] ghost
[32:42] has made you overseers to feed the
[32:44] church of god which he
[32:45] purchased with his own blood
[32:48] so so a seal denotes ownership
[32:51] amen god amen god created the blood the
[32:55] blood of jesus christ was the created
[32:56] blood of god
[32:57] that's what scripture tells us and god
[32:59] purchased us with his own blood
[33:01] amen and now he put a seal upon us in
[33:03] the new birth
[33:04] and that seal denotes ownership who we
[33:07] belong to
[33:08] let's go to first corinthians chapter 6.
[33:14] first corinthians chapter 6
[33:17] and verse 19.
[33:28] first corinthians 6 19 what know you not
[33:30] that your body is the temple of the holy
[33:32] ghost
[33:32] which is in you which you have of god
[33:35] and you are not your own
[33:36] for ye are bought with a price therefore
[33:39] glorify god in your body
[33:40] and in your spirit which are gods so
[33:44] a seal the seal of the holy ghost
[33:46] denotes ownership
[33:47] let's go to revelation 13.
[33:54] revelation 13 and verse 8.
[34:06] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[34:08] worship him whose names are not written
[34:10] in the book of life of the lamb
[34:12] slain from the foundation of the world
[34:15] so this book
[34:16] has a title but it's an interesting
[34:19] title
[34:20] the book of life of the lamb
[34:26] or the lamb's book of life but i like
[34:29] this
[34:30] the way it's worded let's just take it
[34:31] exactly the way it's worded and not
[34:33] change it in our minds
[34:36] let's look at this again in the book
[34:39] of life of the lamb
[34:43] slain from the foundation of the world
[34:45] so is this
[34:46] book about the lamb's life
[34:49] it's the book of the life
[34:52] of the lamb brother brown tells us
[34:56] that this bible is the the entire
[34:59] revelation of jesus christ
[35:02] he tells us that title deed book amen is
[35:05] the revelation of jesus christ
[35:07] the book that's in the hand of him that
[35:08] sits on the throne making that book and
[35:10] this bible the same thing
[35:12] and it's all about what jesus christ so
[35:15] it's the book
[35:16] of the life of the lamb as that life has
[35:19] been coming down through 6 000 years
[35:24] let's go to revelation 21.
[35:32] revelation 21 and 27
[35:38] and there shall no wise enter into into
[35:42] it anything that defileth neither
[35:43] whatsoever a work of abomination or make
[35:45] of the lie
[35:46] but they which are written in the lamb's
[35:49] book of life
[35:50] so this book is a book that's sealed
[35:54] but there's an ownership described to
[35:56] this life or or this
[35:57] this book this book of life is is about
[36:00] the life of the lamb slain from the
[36:02] foundation of the world
[36:03] and it's called the lamb's book of life
[36:05] showing that
[36:06] the book is about somebody
[36:09] and belongs to somebody
[36:14] it's amazing because it's the book of
[36:16] life of the lamb from
[36:17] same old from the foundation of the
[36:19] world the lamb's book of life
[36:21] and the lamb's book of life is the is
[36:23] the revelation of jesus christ
[36:25] and this book is a book of life and it's
[36:28] the revelation of jesus christ
[36:31] both books are telling the same thing
[36:36] let's look here in the breach
[36:39] so we're jumping between the book
[36:42] and you you're sealed and your seal
[36:45] denotes ownership
[36:46] god owns you by your new birth by the
[36:49] seal of the holy ghost to seal on your
[36:51] life
[36:52] shows who the owner is amen and so
[36:55] the book also shows ownership when it
[36:58] when adam lost it it went into the hands
[37:00] of the original owner
[37:02] but the original owner is not the
[37:04] intended owner
[37:08] the intended owner is the one who the
[37:10] book's about
[37:14] he's the intended owner amen and when
[37:16] he's finished the work of redemption
[37:18] he'll go and take his book
[37:22] he's just holding it god is just holding
[37:25] it for him
[37:25] waiting for the time for some who's
[37:27] worthy to come and take it he's just
[37:29] holding it
[37:30] he's not i should say it this way and
[37:32] remember this is all
[37:33] symbology amen we're just talking about
[37:36] symbology the mystery is just being
[37:37] holding the mystery that's held within
[37:39] god from the foundation of the world
[37:41] what god had in the back part of his
[37:42] mind while god is holding and he's
[37:44] waiting
[37:45] he's waiting he's waiting until there's
[37:48] a lamb who's accomplished redemption who
[37:50] can come
[37:51] now and take that book and loose that
[37:53] seals and what does he do when he loses
[37:55] the seals
[37:55] he throws it down to his seventh church
[37:57] age messenger that's on the earth amen
[37:59] in that church age messenger turns and
[38:00] gives it to the people
[38:04] this book is for the lamb this book is
[38:07] about the lamb
[38:08] this book is for the lamb amen and then
[38:10] why is it
[38:11] why is the lamb sharing the book with
[38:14] the people on earth
[38:15] amen the people that he's sharing the
[38:17] book with must have something to do with
[38:19] the book
[38:23] hallelujah because remember
[38:27] none of the wicked will understand seals
[38:28] are open wicked don't understand
[38:32] but the wise will understand
[38:36] okay in the breach he says and and
[38:38] revealed as the seals break and are
[38:40] released to us
[38:41] released to us then we can see what this
[38:45] great plan of redemption
[38:47] is and when and how it began to be done
[38:50] it's all hidden in this book of mystery
[38:52] here it's sealed up with seven seals
[38:55] and so the lamb is the only one who can
[38:57] break them
[38:58] now we realize now if you'd like to look
[39:01] in the scripture
[39:02] you can get it over in jeremiah and find
[39:04] out there
[39:05] where he was when he was going into
[39:07] captivity of the land you know he
[39:09] they brought his uncle his uncle's son
[39:12] some property
[39:13] and he went through that ceiling and
[39:14] brother bran mentions this several times
[39:16] throughout the seal series is look at
[39:17] jeremiah
[39:18] look into jeremiah if you want to see
[39:20] this look in jeremiah and you go back
[39:22] and read in jeremiah
[39:23] you find out that jeremiah was right
[39:26] just before they were going to be led
[39:27] into babylonian captivity
[39:29] which is a type of the false church
[39:32] amen and he takes and he buys a portion
[39:36] of land
[39:37] he he he purchases he makes the purchase
[39:39] price
[39:40] for a piece of land amen and he takes
[39:43] and he takes and
[39:44] he writes down that purchase the
[39:46] evidence of the purchase the price of
[39:47] the purchase whatever it is
[39:49] and then he seals it up and he places a
[39:51] seal on and he puts it in an earthen jar
[39:53] and he leaves it amen with the scribe
[39:55] amen because there's an appointed time
[39:58] for that to be opened amen
[39:59] and the appointed time for that to be
[40:02] open is when it's time for redemption
[40:04] claims to be made on what was purchased
[40:07] when they come back and jeremiah was not
[40:09] going to be the individual to come back
[40:11] he knew they were going for 70 years
[40:13] but he knew his heir
[40:17] the one who come from him his heir would
[40:20] come back into the land
[40:22] and when they come back into the land
[40:24] amen they had a rightful they had a
[40:26] right to redeem
[40:27] this property because it was already
[40:30] paid for
[40:31] and the seal underneath the seal was all
[40:34] the details they needed
[40:36] to make sure that the right inheritance
[40:38] went to the right person
[40:41] so he didn't seal it to hide it amen he
[40:44] sealed it to preserve it
[40:46] he didn't seal it amen he didn't seal it
[40:48] so nobody would know
[40:49] he sealed it so only the right person
[40:51] would know
[40:55] the one who had rights to what was under
[40:57] the seal
[40:59] and so he keeps talking about jeremiah
[41:02] jeremiah go back and look at jeremiah
[41:04] and what is the seal to know the seal
[41:06] denotes
[41:07] ownership jeremiah had sealed what he
[41:10] owned
[41:11] and remember this lamb's book of life
[41:13] was written from before the foundation
[41:15] of the world
[41:16] when the lamb was slain and the mind of
[41:18] god before the foundation of the world
[41:20] because the price was paid before the
[41:22] fall
[41:25] the price was paid friends listen the
[41:28] price was paid by god before there was a
[41:30] need for a price to be paid
[41:33] that's how secure your salvation is that
[41:36] before you needed
[41:37] a price to be paid there was a price
[41:39] paid and it was recorded in a book
[41:41] and it was sealed amen so that when it
[41:44] come time
[41:45] that the children of god needed to
[41:47] realize what their inheritance and what
[41:49] the redemption claims were
[41:50] amen it was time now to take the book
[41:53] and open the seals amen not to hide it
[41:55] from them but to show it to them
[41:59] so that they would have the courage to
[42:01] take redemption claims
[42:03] so they would be bold enough amen to go
[42:05] and claim what's theirs they'd be gold
[42:07] enough
[42:08] to take the position that's theirs amen
[42:10] and realize that they're not treading on
[42:12] somebody else's land
[42:13] jeremiah's descendants that would come
[42:15] back they weren't walking on somebody
[42:17] else's pieces of property
[42:18] they weren't trying to take what didn't
[42:19] belong to them remember when they were
[42:21] calling for eternal life
[42:23] amen they were calling for their own
[42:25] inheritance
[42:28] when they were claiming this is mine and
[42:30] this is mine and this is mine
[42:32] they were only claiming what was
[42:33] rightfully theirs by a purchase price
[42:35] that was made
[42:36] [Music]
[42:40] before there was a need for there was a
[42:43] deed for the lamb to be slain the lamb
[42:46] was slain
[42:48] and it was recorded and it was sealed
[42:52] and it shows ownership
[42:56] jeremiah owned that land
[43:00] because he paid the price of redemption
[43:02] silver
[43:04] redemption jeremiah owned that land
[43:08] and because jeremiah owned the land he
[43:10] could share it with whoever he wanted to
[43:13] and he chose to share it with those who
[43:16] came from him
[43:19] his family that's who had rights to it
[43:24] that that
[43:28] i just i just say this way that's who
[43:30] was listed in that document
[43:33] that was sealed away and tucked away was
[43:36] was jeremiah's descendants and i i'll
[43:39] venture out on this and say
[43:41] jeremiah may not have known their name
[43:45] they may not have been born yet the one
[43:47] who can come and claim this
[43:50] but he put their name
[43:53] he put their name in there but it may
[43:55] not been the the letters that made up
[43:57] their earthly name
[43:58] amen their name that was in there was
[44:00] their position my children my
[44:02] grandchild the one that comes from my
[44:04] loins the one that have my blood in them
[44:06] the one that's come from me amen if
[44:08] there anyone that comes from that way
[44:10] in that position and that way they have
[44:12] rights to claim what's theirs
[44:15] and what was that their name was in that
[44:17] document
[44:18] and it may not been the name that they
[44:20] were called on earth amen but they
[44:22] were called by a name
[44:25] it was their position it was their
[44:27] position and inheritance
[44:29] it was their position in relation to
[44:31] jeremiah
[44:32] now he may have had names in there i'm
[44:34] not i don't know but i don't know if he
[44:36] would have had to
[44:41] i mean reading on in the breach
[44:44] he says and now we're going to see what
[44:46] the book
[44:47] says about how it became open
[44:51] it is not made known until the lamb
[44:53] takes the book and breaks the seals and
[44:55] opens the book see
[44:57] the lamb's got to take the book it's
[45:00] his so who does the book belong to
[45:04] it belongs to the lamb the lamb paid the
[45:06] price he paid the price before the
[45:08] foundation of the world and the mind of
[45:09] god
[45:10] he came down and he paid the price on
[45:12] earth in this dimension
[45:13] amen in a physical body paid the price
[45:15] of blood for redemption and he purchased
[45:18] back that book
[45:19] but he doesn't go to claim the book
[45:22] until
[45:23] he's finished a redemption cycle
[45:26] so he stays in an office of mediation
[45:30] and so but the lamb's got to take the
[45:32] book it's his
[45:34] so if it's his it went back to the
[45:36] original owner
[45:37] but it did not go back to the intended
[45:39] owner it's the lamb's book
[45:41] it was intended to be the lamb's book
[45:43] when the lamb was slain before the
[45:45] foundation of the world
[45:46] and the original owner who created the
[45:49] title deed
[45:51] is holding the book in his hand
[45:55] not to keep it from man
[45:59] but to keep it for man
[46:04] it goes back the mystery is held in
[46:06] god's heart
[46:07] god doesn't let it go god never turns it
[46:10] loose
[46:10] god never forgets it he's holding it not
[46:13] to
[46:14] keep it from man but he's holding it to
[46:16] give it to
[46:17] man but he's got to wait till the
[46:19] conditions that are on the seals are met
[46:22] and when the conditions are met then the
[46:24] one who this was intended to go to which
[46:27] was his son
[46:28] can now come forth and take the book
[46:30] because it's his
[46:34] praise be to god friends praise be to
[46:37] god
[46:39] our position is so secure in christ
[46:44] if we can just really let this soak in
[46:48] and not make this a story not make it a
[46:50] parable
[46:51] not apply it to other people amen but
[46:54] bring it home and say
[46:55] that's me that man up there on that
[46:57] podium is talking about me
[46:58] amen i'm in that book i've come from god
[47:02] i go to god i've got a part in that
[47:04] inheritance i'm listed
[47:05] underneath those seals then you'll
[47:10] realize
[47:11] you were secure from before the
[47:12] foundation of the world you were secure
[47:13] from before the fall
[47:18] the lamb's got to take the book it's his
[47:20] now remember no man in heaven no man on
[47:22] earth
[47:22] pope bishop cardinal state presbyter or
[47:24] whoever he is can break them seals
[47:27] or reveal the book but the lamb
[47:30] and we have probed and presumed and
[47:32] stumbled and wandered
[47:34] and that's the reason we're all in such
[47:36] a confusion but when the divine promise
[47:38] that's in the book of redemption will be
[47:40] perfectly opened by the lamb
[47:42] and the seals thereof will be loosed by
[47:45] the lamb in the last day
[47:46] in which we're living now
[47:50] the purpose is not to be opened in
[47:53] heaven so you can understand the whole
[47:54] plan
[47:55] the purpose is to be opened here
[47:59] in the last day daniel was told it's
[48:02] sealed into the last
[48:04] until the time of the end now
[48:07] brother bam saying the lamb is going to
[48:09] loose the seals
[48:11] in the last day in which we're living
[48:14] now it is not made known until the lamb
[48:17] takes the book and breaks the seals
[48:20] because remember the book was being
[48:21] holden in the hands of him that set up
[48:23] on the throne
[48:24] and the lamb comes to him that sets upon
[48:26] the throne and
[48:27] takes the book out of his right hand
[48:29] takes the book
[48:32] he takes the book because it's his he
[48:35] doesn't take the book because he's doing
[48:36] anything wrong he takes the book because
[48:38] it's his
[48:39] but realize brother brahm said this has
[48:41] to happen
[48:42] at the end time and brother brahma said
[48:44] the time we're in now
[48:46] it's not for a future opening it's for
[48:48] the time that brother bannon said is
[48:50] now and he said it will be open and
[48:53] during the last
[48:54] messengers the last angel messengers
[48:56] ministry
[48:58] well then it has to be open it's a book
[49:01] that has
[49:02] to do with redemption of creation it's a
[49:03] book that has to do with sons of god
[49:05] it's a book that has to do with the life
[49:07] of the lamb
[49:09] and it has to be open at the end time
[49:13] not after the end time at the end time
[49:16] and the lamb is the only one that can
[49:18] open the book because it's his
[49:21] so if the book is opened the lamb's
[49:22] opened it
[49:24] there's no other option
[49:29] but remember the wicked won't understand
[49:32] you open it you read the contents and
[49:35] the wicked won't understand
[49:38] but the wise don't understand
[49:42] brother says the second thing
[49:46] that uh that a seal denotes
[49:50] is security the first thing is ownership
[49:53] the second thing is security back in the
[49:56] seals he says another thing is a seal is
[49:58] security
[49:59] seal means you are secured now you that
[50:02] don't believe in eternal security
[50:04] i don't know but now but a seal signify
[50:07] security to its destination
[50:10] woe into that guy that would try to
[50:12] break that seal
[50:14] and the holy spirit seal cannot be
[50:16] broken
[50:17] so brother man's doing the same thing
[50:18] he's taking these
[50:20] seals what they denote he's been
[50:22] bringing it to you personally but also
[50:24] to the book
[50:25] and we'll see that here in a minute but
[50:27] a seal means you are secured
[50:30] eternal he says then the the statement i
[50:33] just my marvel brother ben says
[50:35] you that don't believe in eternal
[50:36] security i don't know like he doesn't
[50:38] even know what to say
[50:41] because the seal means security you're
[50:42] sealed until the day of redemption
[50:46] that's ephesians 4 30 brother mary first
[50:48] he says and grieve not the holy spirit
[50:49] of god
[50:50] whereby you were sealed unto the day of
[50:51] redemption a seal denotes
[50:54] ownership and security god owns you
[50:57] and has secured you to your destination
[51:01] that's why the new birth listen the new
[51:04] birth is not something you take and put
[51:06] on yourself
[51:08] because it's a seal of god god has to be
[51:11] the one ceiling
[51:12] first he has to know who you are and he
[51:14] has to know that you're in that book
[51:16] amen and then he has to fix his seal and
[51:18] you're showing that you belong to me
[51:19] this is my ownership
[51:21] and you're secure unto your destination
[51:23] you
[51:24] realize then that makes the new birth
[51:25] not something you can press into not
[51:27] something you work up not something you
[51:28] can pull down
[51:29] not something you can manufacture not
[51:31] something you can fake not something you
[51:32] can copy
[51:33] it's not anything you can do because
[51:34] it's the seal of god
[51:38] and it has to be given sovereignly by
[51:40] god
[51:42] and god has promised to give it to those
[51:44] who obey his word
[51:49] he says brother brahman says concerning
[51:51] the new birth there's just a quote here
[51:52] i found that i just want to read
[51:54] in the message paradox he says for
[51:56] instance i believe that every born-again
[51:58] member of the body of christ is a
[52:00] paradox in themselves
[52:02] i believe each one of you methodist and
[52:03] presbyterian and lutheran that never had
[52:06] experienced the baptism of the holy
[52:07] spirit was in some formal church that
[52:08] did not believe in the genuine new birth
[52:11] and has now received the baptism of the
[52:12] holy ghost is a perfect example of a
[52:15] paradox
[52:16] because something happened to you that
[52:19] changed your whole being
[52:21] and anyone could look at that and know
[52:23] what a paradox is a miracle
[52:26] unless that happens you cannot be a
[52:28] christian
[52:29] listen it makes it clear unless
[52:32] something happens to you that changes
[52:33] your whole being
[52:35] that changes who you are an experience
[52:37] with god that changes you changes your
[52:39] course changes your thinking
[52:40] it changes changes you
[52:43] he said unless that happens you cannot
[52:45] be a christian there must be a paradox
[52:47] for you to become a christian
[52:49] because no one can change a spirit in a
[52:51] man and give him a new birth outside of
[52:53] god
[52:54] god alone is the only one can do it and
[52:56] it's a miracle how that god can take a
[52:58] man's thinking
[52:59] in his ways and his life and everything
[53:01] and change it from what it was
[53:03] to what it can be and what he can make
[53:05] it
[53:07] that's the paradox that's the new birth
[53:09] that's
[53:10] that that's the seal of security that's
[53:13] the seal of
[53:14] ownership that's the theo seal of
[53:16] authenticity
[53:17] you're an authentic child of god
[53:20] because god affixed the seal god brought
[53:23] the new birth
[53:24] god quickened the seed god brought the
[53:26] change not something you did
[53:28] something he did
[53:31] romans 8 31 says and why shall we then
[53:34] say to these things if god before us who
[53:36] can be against us
[53:37] he despaired not his own son but
[53:39] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[53:41] not with him also freely give us all
[53:42] things
[53:43] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[53:45] god's elect it is god that justifieth
[53:47] who is he that condemneth it is god that
[53:49] died ye rather it's christ that die
[53:51] ye rather that has risen again who is
[53:52] even at the right hand of god
[53:54] who also maketh intercession for us who
[53:56] shall sep who shall separate us
[53:58] from the love of christ shall
[54:00] tribulation or distress
[54:02] or persecution or famine or neckiness or
[54:05] peril or sword
[54:06] as it is written for thy sake we are
[54:08] killed all the day long we are counted
[54:10] as sheep for the slaughter
[54:11] and they in all these things we are more
[54:13] than conquerors through him that loved
[54:15] us
[54:15] for i am persuaded that neither death
[54:17] nor life nor angels
[54:19] nor principalities nor powers nor things
[54:21] present nor things to come
[54:23] nor height nor depth nor any other
[54:25] creature shall be able to separate us
[54:27] from the love of god which is in christ
[54:29] jesus our lord
[54:31] a seal denotes security
[54:35] what shall separate us he went through a
[54:37] big list
[54:38] and i don't think that was an exhaustive
[54:40] list i think you can keep adding to that
[54:42] list
[54:44] nothing shall be able to separate us
[54:46] from the love of god that's god's grace
[54:48] his love for us which is in christ jesus
[54:51] our lord
[54:53] let's turn and look at two scriptures
[54:55] very familiar let's go to the gospel of
[54:56] john
[54:58] john chapter 10 i want to read these two
[55:00] scriptures and then move on
[55:04] john chapter 10
[55:07] and verse 27.
[55:13] now don't forget i'm talking about you
[55:15] but i haven't stopped talking about the
[55:17] book
[55:19] that's going to become clear in a minute
[55:21] i'm talking about you but i haven't
[55:22] stopped talking about the book
[55:25] i hope you catch that say it one more
[55:28] time
[55:30] i'm talking about you but i haven't
[55:32] stopped talking about the book
[55:36] because i'm not talking about two
[55:37] different things
[55:41] john 10 27
[55:45] my sheep hear my voice and i know them
[55:48] and they follow me and i give unto them
[55:51] eternal life and they shall never perish
[55:53] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[55:55] my hand for my father
[55:57] which gave them me is greater than all
[56:00] and no man is able to pluck them
[56:03] pluck them out of my father's hand i
[56:06] and my father are one
[56:10] the seal denotes security the seal comes
[56:14] upon our lives because our names are
[56:16] written in the lamb's book of life
[56:19] so it will secure before the foundation
[56:21] of the world
[56:22] it'll be secure when this world burns
[56:24] over
[56:25] it'll always be secure let's go back to
[56:28] john chapter 6.
[56:32] in verse 37.
[56:39] boy i just got a scare this clock says
[56:42] 12 49.
[56:47] don't worry all is well we have lots of
[56:50] time
[56:52] john chapter 6 verse 37.
[56:59] all that the father giveth me shall come
[57:01] to me
[57:02] and listen this isn't this isn't a
[57:06] statement
[57:07] that has any hope attached to it
[57:09] whatsoever this is an emphatic statement
[57:11] this is an absolute statement
[57:14] all that the father hath previously hath
[57:16] beforehand hath
[57:17] past tense given to me shall future
[57:20] tense
[57:22] so this spans time friends all that god
[57:25] hath given me
[57:26] in the past shall come to me
[57:30] jesus was not even talking about
[57:31] something that was presently happening
[57:33] he was talking about something that has
[57:34] already happened and will happen
[57:37] this is how secure we are under this
[57:40] seal
[57:40] and i say this is how secure we are in
[57:42] the sealed book amen
[57:44] because the seal on your life of the new
[57:46] birth is only declaring what's already
[57:48] in the sealed book
[57:52] john chapter 6 i want to finish reading
[57:53] here
[57:56] all right all that the father giveth me
[58:00] shall come to me and him that cometh to
[58:02] me i will in no wise cast out
[58:05] for i come down from heaven not to do my
[58:07] own will but the will of him
[58:10] that sent me and this is the father's
[58:12] will
[58:13] which hath sent me that of all which he
[58:16] hath
[58:16] hath given me i should lose nothing but
[58:20] should raise it up again at the last day
[58:23] why why would we lose nothing because
[58:26] it's already sealed
[58:28] in that book amen that adam lost but was
[58:31] holding in the hand of him that sat on
[58:33] the throne hey listen it's not
[58:36] it's like i said it's symbology so don't
[58:39] get caught up in the symbology
[58:40] amen god is holding the mystery within
[58:43] him
[58:43] but the mystery wasn't for him alone he
[58:46] wanted to share this mystery with his
[58:48] attributes
[58:49] he wanted to share this mystery with his
[58:51] children so that he would
[58:52] hold it he would hold it in mystery form
[58:55] until it was time for the lamb to come
[58:57] and take the book
[58:58] and break the seals and reveal the
[58:59] mystery that god had been holding in his
[59:01] heart
[59:02] all along not about paper it's not about
[59:06] somebody sitting in a chair
[59:07] somebody holding a book and somebody
[59:08] else walking up to somebody with a book
[59:10] amen it's a mystery that god had held
[59:12] dear to himself and he had sealed it
[59:14] within himself
[59:15] amen he wanted to show the mystery and
[59:17] adam and adam
[59:18] and he had come forth with adam a son of
[59:21] god and out of adam he took a wife
[59:23] amen what is this this is the seventh
[59:24] seal coming right up from genesis
[59:27] and he brought the woman that came out
[59:29] of the man back to the man
[59:31] and he called their name adam amen he
[59:33] took the two and made them one
[59:36] they were one and they were one in
[59:37] origin they were one in union
[59:42] and then and then that image fell that
[59:44] great masterpiece that was reflecting
[59:46] what was in god's mind fell
[59:48] amen and so god amen took
[59:51] the title deed from adam oh
[59:54] if i could just explain this the way
[59:56] it's in my heart adam didn't give up a
[59:58] piece of paper back to god
[1:00:00] amen adam lost the whole purpose and
[1:00:03] intention and revelation and
[1:00:04] understanding of what he was on earth
[1:00:06] for
[1:00:07] he he couldn't go back to the tree of
[1:00:10] life now
[1:00:10] he was driven out and cherubim's
[1:00:12] replaced with a flaming sword
[1:00:14] to drive him away to keep him from
[1:00:16] taking of the tree of life what is the
[1:00:17] tree of life christ what is christ the
[1:00:19] word
[1:00:19] what did the what did the woman leave
[1:00:21] she left the word the tree of life to
[1:00:23] take the tree of the knowledge of good
[1:00:24] and evil
[1:00:26] so when adam lost the title deed what he
[1:00:29] lost is he lost the revelation of the
[1:00:32] word
[1:00:34] i hope you understand what i'm saying
[1:00:35] not a piece of paper
[1:00:38] he was driven away from the tree of life
[1:00:40] which is christ which is the word
[1:00:44] and now there was there was a flaming
[1:00:47] sword
[1:00:48] a man keeping the way
[1:00:51] of the tree of life not to keep man from
[1:00:54] it forever
[1:00:55] to but to keep the way to make sure that
[1:00:57] there was a way back
[1:01:00] to preserve to keep the guard the way
[1:01:02] back
[1:01:03] but certain conditions had to be met
[1:01:05] first
[1:01:06] brother emanuel was here a couple weeks
[1:01:08] ago and he said remember him he read
[1:01:09] that quote where he said
[1:01:11] now that flaming sword will not be
[1:01:13] sheathed air was bloodied by the blood
[1:01:15] of the lamb
[1:01:16] and then the sheath was the the sword
[1:01:19] was sheathed
[1:01:20] and now those cherubims were ushering
[1:01:23] men back
[1:01:24] to the tree of life because the price
[1:01:26] had been paid
[1:01:27] adam didn't lose a piece of paper
[1:01:31] and adam didn't just lose it wasn't just
[1:01:34] it wasn't that he just lost the right to
[1:01:36] say tree pluck up here and move over
[1:01:37] there
[1:01:39] because in the grand scheme of things
[1:01:41] that's quite trivial
[1:01:43] i mean i don't mean i'm not mocking in
[1:01:45] any way
[1:01:47] but in the grand scheme of things what
[1:01:49] would you rather have
[1:01:50] in all of your life would you rather
[1:01:52] have the power to pluck up a tree and
[1:01:54] move it over here or would you rather be
[1:01:55] declared absolutely
[1:01:57] innocent and virtue in the eyes of god
[1:01:59] sinless and guiltless and free from all
[1:02:01] fault
[1:02:02] which means more to you which means more
[1:02:04] to you
[1:02:05] the power or ability amen to move to
[1:02:08] hold a son in place
[1:02:09] or the revelation that you're a son of
[1:02:11] god and come from the mind of god and
[1:02:12] going back to the mind of god going back
[1:02:14] to god
[1:02:15] which is a greater thing amen the
[1:02:17] revelation of the contents of the title
[1:02:19] deed or
[1:02:20] the power to reconstruct nature
[1:02:24] so he lost more than just the ability
[1:02:27] to say sun stand still or tree pluck up
[1:02:29] and move or wind stop blowing
[1:02:31] he lost more than that friend amen he
[1:02:34] lost his innocency
[1:02:37] he lost his access to the tree of life
[1:02:40] christ
[1:02:41] the word he lost his position
[1:02:46] in christ
[1:02:50] i'd rather have my position in christ
[1:02:52] secure than all the powers that are on
[1:02:53] this planet
[1:03:01] the third thing the third thing
[1:03:05] that a seal denotes is a finished
[1:03:08] work now he's talking about you
[1:03:12] but i never stopped talking about the
[1:03:14] book
[1:03:17] a seal denotes a finished work
[1:03:20] in the breach mess he said like i used
[1:03:21] to work for the railroad company
[1:03:23] we'd load box cars with cans and
[1:03:25] different things from the canning
[1:03:27] factory
[1:03:27] but then before that car could be sealed
[1:03:29] the inspector came around to see
[1:03:31] if that car was properly loaded if not
[1:03:34] the first time it rammed together
[1:03:36] something it'd scatter the stuff and
[1:03:37] break it and the railroad company was
[1:03:39] responsible and the inspector would
[1:03:41] test everything to see if it was
[1:03:42] properly in place
[1:03:44] if it wasn't he condemned the car then
[1:03:46] we'd had to do it all over again until
[1:03:48] the inspector was satisfied
[1:03:50] and when the inspector's satisfied he
[1:03:51] shuts the door the inspector shuts the
[1:03:53] door
[1:03:53] and the inspector places a seal upon it
[1:03:55] and then no one can break that this seal
[1:03:58] until it reaches its destination
[1:04:00] so remember brother said it's secured to
[1:04:02] its destination it declares ownership
[1:04:04] and many times he's talking about this
[1:04:06] seal in the boxcar he said he used to
[1:04:08] work packing the box cars and you had to
[1:04:10] get them just right because they
[1:04:11] couldn't jostle them out and break so
[1:04:13] it had to be inside had to be secure
[1:04:15] before there was a seal put on the
[1:04:17] outside
[1:04:19] and he's typing in with you inside there
[1:04:21] has to be a security
[1:04:22] amen that comes from belief in
[1:04:24] revelation in a new birth
[1:04:26] amen by my by the holy ghost quickening
[1:04:28] a seed the inside has to be secure
[1:04:30] and then he puts them outside a seal you
[1:04:33] begin to live the life of jesus christ
[1:04:36] for all to see and so he started talking
[1:04:40] about this and he's typing you but
[1:04:42] he's going to take the same analogy two
[1:04:44] paragraphs later or three paragraphs
[1:04:45] later
[1:04:46] and he's going to start talking about
[1:04:47] the book and i want you to think about
[1:04:49] this
[1:04:49] the rail car was packed amen it was
[1:04:52] packed correctly all the contents were
[1:04:54] put in place
[1:04:55] in the rail car when everything was put
[1:04:57] in place and everything was correct and
[1:04:59] everything was there
[1:05:00] amen there was a seal put on it and when
[1:05:02] the seal put was put on it that seal
[1:05:04] showed
[1:05:05] who owned it that the contents inside
[1:05:08] were secure
[1:05:11] and that nobody had the authority to
[1:05:14] open this
[1:05:15] until it got to its destination
[1:05:20] this is my favorite part i said
[1:05:23] everything i said before to get to this
[1:05:29] brother further in the breach paragraph
[1:05:30] 70 says seal signifies now this is words
[1:05:33] i got from the dictionary
[1:05:35] seal signifies a finished work and when
[1:05:38] the seventh seal is broken the mystery
[1:05:40] of god that's sealed in these mystery
[1:05:42] mysterious seals is finished
[1:05:44] until the day that the seal is broken
[1:05:46] then it's revealed what's on the inside
[1:05:48] of it
[1:05:49] if the man's wondering what's in the box
[1:05:51] car you say
[1:05:52] it's supposed to be such and such
[1:05:55] they're supposed to be
[1:05:56] he's presuming but when the seal is
[1:05:59] broken and the door is open
[1:06:00] we see into it then then
[1:06:04] and see exactly what's in there you see
[1:06:07] it
[1:06:08] and that'll only be done at the end time
[1:06:11] but the man's not talking about a boxcar
[1:06:12] now he's talking about the seal that's
[1:06:15] on the book amen
[1:06:16] when it gets to its destination listen
[1:06:19] you gotta you gotta hang with me for a
[1:06:21] few minutes
[1:06:21] when that boxcar finally gets to where
[1:06:23] it's supposed to go it's been traveling
[1:06:25] down the line
[1:06:26] for six thousand years but when it
[1:06:28] finally gets to where it's supposed to
[1:06:30] go when it reaches his destination
[1:06:32] there has to be one with the authority
[1:06:34] to break the seal
[1:06:35] amen when he breaks the seal he can't
[1:06:37] break it till it's at the destination
[1:06:39] when it's made the destination then he
[1:06:41] can break the seal we know that the
[1:06:43] contents are secure
[1:06:44] it was secured before the seal was put
[1:06:46] on
[1:06:49] amen praise god amen your security goes
[1:06:54] all the way back before your natural
[1:06:56] birth goes all the way back before adam
[1:06:58] and eve on this earth
[1:06:59] your security goes all the way back when
[1:07:01] that book was written the lamb's book of
[1:07:03] life
[1:07:04] was written before the foundation of the
[1:07:05] world that's in your security that's
[1:07:07] when the boxcar was packed friends
[1:07:12] what boxcar the boxcar of the life of
[1:07:14] the lamb that was slain before the
[1:07:16] foundation of the world
[1:07:17] when that boxcar went everything every
[1:07:19] attribute every part
[1:07:21] everything was packed in that box car it
[1:07:23] was secured
[1:07:24] it was sealed and it was headed down the
[1:07:27] line for a destination
[1:07:28] and god knew where it was going to wind
[1:07:30] up he knew when it was going to wind up
[1:07:32] and he knew everything that was going to
[1:07:33] be in the boxcar when it got there
[1:07:37] that's what the seals show us friends
[1:07:40] that before the foundation of the world
[1:07:42] god had already chosen who would be in
[1:07:45] and who would be out
[1:07:47] god had already packed the boxcar god
[1:07:49] had already written the names in the
[1:07:50] lamb's book of life amen he had already
[1:07:52] sealed it amen
[1:07:53] he had already sent it down the line and
[1:07:55] he already had a destination in mind
[1:07:57] and he already knew what the conditions
[1:07:59] would be to have to be met
[1:08:01] to open that seal and when he opened the
[1:08:03] seal it wasn't just for the eyes of him
[1:08:06] who opened the seal
[1:08:08] but when he opened the seal and threw
[1:08:10] open that door it was forever he
[1:08:12] for whosoever he invited to look therein
[1:08:16] and you could see what was on the inside
[1:08:18] of that box corn
[1:08:21] and brother said that'll only be done at
[1:08:23] the end time
[1:08:25] which brother branham emphatically
[1:08:27] declared that in his day
[1:08:29] 50 some years ago that it was the end
[1:08:31] time
[1:08:32] brother branham was not looking for a
[1:08:34] future end time he showed us that the
[1:08:36] end time had
[1:08:37] arrived it's been the end time
[1:08:41] since brother branham declared it to be
[1:08:43] the end time
[1:08:45] and it is during that end time that the
[1:08:47] seal is broken that the lamb takes the
[1:08:49] book and the lamb breaks the seal
[1:08:51] the lamb opens the book the lamb reveals
[1:08:53] the contents and the lamb invites
[1:08:55] those who are part of inheritance to see
[1:08:57] what's in the
[1:08:58] in the boxcar or in the book
[1:09:03] hebrews 4 3 says for we which have
[1:09:06] believed do enter into rest as he said
[1:09:08] as i have sworn in my wrath
[1:09:10] if they shall enter into my rest
[1:09:12] although the works were finished from
[1:09:13] the foundation
[1:09:15] of the world if they'll enter into my
[1:09:18] rest but he already knew he'd enter into
[1:09:20] the rest the works were finished
[1:09:22] from the foundation of the world
[1:09:27] see as the boxcar
[1:09:30] or the lamb's book of life is moving
[1:09:34] down through history
[1:09:37] everything is written present tense
[1:09:41] everything is spoken present tense and
[1:09:43] everything is spoken
[1:09:44] present tense for free moral agency
[1:09:48] so it's always would if you would come
[1:09:50] to him
[1:09:53] if you believe if you see come now
[1:09:57] come now but you realize it was sealed
[1:10:01] before the foundation of the world
[1:10:04] it was already there in the land's book
[1:10:05] of life no names are being added to the
[1:10:08] lamb's book of life
[1:10:08] all the names that were ever written
[1:10:10] were written there before
[1:10:12] but as the lamb's book of life is moving
[1:10:15] down displaying itself
[1:10:16] i hope you understand what i'm saying
[1:10:19] portraying itself displaying itself in
[1:10:21] types and in moses and
[1:10:22] abraham and noah as it's moving down
[1:10:25] through in types
[1:10:28] it's always present tense
[1:10:33] whosoever will if you believe come into
[1:10:36] the ark
[1:10:37] the door is open rain is coming
[1:10:40] destruction's falling
[1:10:41] come into the ark amen anybody it's
[1:10:44] always spoken present tense
[1:10:46] and it's always spoken free moral agency
[1:10:50] 120 years he preached about the coming
[1:10:53] destruction and the safety in the ark
[1:10:55] but the only people who wound up sealed
[1:10:57] in the ark were the ones who were
[1:10:59] already predestinated to be sealed in
[1:11:01] the ark
[1:11:03] but it's always because god is a
[1:11:05] righteous judge he always gives the
[1:11:07] opportunity like he did to cain
[1:11:09] knowing cain had nothing to receive the
[1:11:11] revelation from so as the book of life
[1:11:13] is moving down through
[1:11:15] it's always present tense it's always
[1:11:17] the opportunity you have
[1:11:19] to come to the light to come to the
[1:11:20] truth and what is that light that light
[1:11:22] is christ
[1:11:24] whatever light is presented in that day
[1:11:26] the light that noah preached the light
[1:11:28] that abraham preached the light that
[1:11:29] moses preached the light that david
[1:11:31] brought
[1:11:31] amen the light that solomon brought it's
[1:11:33] always the light the light and what is
[1:11:35] it that's christ it's christ
[1:11:36] this book is moving down through and
[1:11:38] it's always you can get
[1:11:40] on board the boat amen you can always
[1:11:42] get in the ship
[1:11:44] but you don't realize part of you is
[1:11:46] already in the boat amen
[1:11:47] already in the boxcar already in the
[1:11:50] book
[1:11:53] you're just playing out god's great
[1:11:55] drama on this earth and now you're
[1:11:56] in time taking your position that was
[1:11:59] already predestinated before the
[1:12:01] foundation of the world
[1:12:02] and something now is striking you in an
[1:12:05] element of time
[1:12:06] something is awakening something inside
[1:12:07] of you in an element of time
[1:12:09] and we think that we're making choices
[1:12:11] and
[1:12:14] and there's a degree of choice making a
[1:12:16] god god grants us that amen but
[1:12:18] it's not us choosing christ it's christ
[1:12:20] choosing us
[1:12:24] all our choice is doing is reflecting
[1:12:26] what's already been in his mind
[1:12:28] it's reflecting back to him from from a
[1:12:30] part of him that's already within us
[1:12:34] and so now this book moves down through
[1:12:36] amen
[1:12:37] we we we see the displays and and the
[1:12:40] displays of the light and the displays
[1:12:41] of the life amen
[1:12:43] and those who are able with something
[1:12:45] inside of them to contact that to say
[1:12:47] there's something real about that i
[1:12:49] believe what noah was saying
[1:12:50] i believe what abraham's saying i
[1:12:52] believe what moses is saying
[1:12:54] something in me registers with that
[1:12:56] something and he clicks with that
[1:12:57] amen amen what is it i think i'll choose
[1:13:02] to believe moses
[1:13:06] good choice you did a good job
[1:13:10] all you did was yield to the life on the
[1:13:12] inside the plan of god what god had
[1:13:14] already determined when the light struck
[1:13:15] the sea
[1:13:16] it begins to come to life quickly
[1:13:20] but as it's moving through it's always
[1:13:22] spoken this was the mystery through the
[1:13:23] church ages
[1:13:24] it was always i mean there was such a
[1:13:26] mentality to go out and bang on doors
[1:13:29] and convince people and shake them
[1:13:30] and make them come in and get them to
[1:13:32] sit in the church and baptize them and
[1:13:33] make them sit there
[1:13:34] and if they won't sit there start some
[1:13:36] programs
[1:13:38] get some entertainment go and get some
[1:13:39] programs because if we keep them in the
[1:13:41] church we keep them in christ
[1:13:44] because the confusion about making your
[1:13:46] choice and coming to work they're not
[1:13:48] realizing
[1:13:49] that you already have to be part of the
[1:13:51] lamb's life to be in the lamb's book of
[1:13:53] life
[1:13:54] and whenever the lamb's life is
[1:13:56] presented that part of the lamb's life
[1:13:57] that you
[1:13:58] are connects to the part of the lamb's
[1:14:00] life that's being presented
[1:14:01] and the two are magnetized to one
[1:14:03] another
[1:14:07] praise god god is good friends
[1:14:12] a seal denotes a finished work
[1:14:17] that lands book of life from the
[1:14:20] foundation of the world
[1:14:22] was in the hand of the original owner
[1:14:26] and it had on its seven seals
[1:14:30] which means from the time
[1:14:33] adam lost the title deed book and it
[1:14:36] went back into the hands of the original
[1:14:37] owner
[1:14:38] nothing's changing inside the book
[1:14:42] nothing nothing's being added being
[1:14:46] removed being rearranged nothing's being
[1:14:48] changed
[1:14:49] whatever's there has been there since
[1:14:52] before the seals were put on
[1:14:56] and the removing of the seals will
[1:14:57] change nothing of the contents of the
[1:14:59] document
[1:15:00] the removing of the seals will only
[1:15:01] reveal the contents of the dock
[1:15:05] nothing's changing only
[1:15:08] only things happening is it's being
[1:15:10] revealed
[1:15:11] but it's not changing
[1:15:14] brother memphis said in the message
[1:15:16] things that are to be therefore the
[1:15:18] bride and the rapture will come forth
[1:15:20] and there is all pre-planned by god all
[1:15:24] backed up from the beginning
[1:15:25] he knowed every man every place who
[1:15:27] would set all about it
[1:15:28] it's all pre-planned god knew it would
[1:15:31] be there
[1:15:32] be here and when he made it that way so
[1:15:34] that when we get there
[1:15:35] he's gone to prepare a place for us and
[1:15:37] when we get there it'll all be prepared
[1:15:39] just like
[1:15:40] even this night is prepared like this
[1:15:42] hour's prepared yes his great
[1:15:44] foreknowledge tells him all these things
[1:15:46] by foreknowledge
[1:15:48] so god is not learning and adding to his
[1:15:50] understanding and to his knowledge he's
[1:15:51] not adjusting his plan
[1:15:53] based off you know what somebody will
[1:15:56] decide
[1:15:57] he's already he's already knows the
[1:15:59] works from before
[1:16:02] everything was decided before
[1:16:06] acts 15 18 says known unto god are all
[1:16:08] his works from the beginning of the
[1:16:10] world
[1:16:11] god knew what he was going to do we get
[1:16:14] down in the questions and answers on the
[1:16:16] seals
[1:16:18] brother brown says in paragraph 188 now
[1:16:20] remember the bible said the lamb's book
[1:16:22] of life was written before the
[1:16:24] foundation of the world
[1:16:25] and your name was put in was in that
[1:16:27] book when the lamb was slain before the
[1:16:28] foundation of the world
[1:16:30] to redeem every name that was written in
[1:16:32] the book see
[1:16:33] you got it now see there ain't nothing
[1:16:36] out of order
[1:16:38] it's working just exactly like god's big
[1:16:40] timepiece like a clock moving right
[1:16:42] right around your name was put in there
[1:16:44] before the foundation of the world
[1:16:45] when the lamb was slain to redeem what
[1:16:47] was what was in the book
[1:16:49] and now he comes forward and takes that
[1:16:52] book to claim
[1:16:53] his redemption
[1:16:58] now he's transitioning
[1:17:03] he's going to take the book and open the
[1:17:05] seals there's no question about the
[1:17:07] opening of the seals the seals have been
[1:17:08] opened
[1:17:10] the only one who can open them the lamb
[1:17:12] the lamb has to take the book and open
[1:17:14] the seals
[1:17:15] and when he takes the book and open the
[1:17:17] seals
[1:17:18] he's he's changing in his ministry
[1:17:22] because now he's coming to claim what
[1:17:25] he's redeemed
[1:17:27] or to possess his redemption
[1:17:34] let's keep reading and then we'll
[1:17:35] hopefully the lord will help us to see
[1:17:37] this clearly
[1:17:40] the breach between the seven church ages
[1:17:42] and the seven seals he says now notice
[1:17:44] now this book is sealed
[1:17:46] and you are sealed with the book
[1:17:52] i thought i was sealed at my new birth
[1:17:55] well you already were sealed therefore
[1:17:58] you could be sealed
[1:18:00] you were sealed because you were sealed
[1:18:02] when the book was sealed you were sealed
[1:18:04] with the book
[1:18:05] and because you were sealed with the
[1:18:06] book you could be sealed
[1:18:09] praise god you see how the two go
[1:18:11] together
[1:18:14] in christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:18:16] he says
[1:18:18] and the body must follow the head as the
[1:18:21] wife follows the husband
[1:18:22] being that adam was not deceived he
[1:18:24] walked out with eve he was deceived she
[1:18:26] was in the transgression or the entire
[1:18:28] resurrection
[1:18:29] of the whole body would have come forth
[1:18:30] at the day of the lord jesus
[1:18:32] when he come forth from the grave but he
[1:18:35] he had to redeem her which is his body
[1:18:38] she has to be redeemed in order to come
[1:18:39] to him
[1:18:40] do you see it oh my see it couldn't have
[1:18:44] happened then
[1:18:45] the redemption is going on now you see
[1:18:47] the seals
[1:18:49] now you see the seals when he was in
[1:18:51] this mediator work back there redeeming
[1:18:53] but someday he comes forth to get this
[1:18:55] book that he's redeemed
[1:18:58] and all that's in this book would be him
[1:19:02] i'll just hold up the visual because the
[1:19:04] visuals help but we've got to get away
[1:19:05] from paper in somebody's hand
[1:19:11] he said someday he comes forth to get
[1:19:13] this book that he's redeemed
[1:19:16] and all that's in the book would be him
[1:19:20] so the book is the entire revelation of
[1:19:22] jesus christ the book is all about him
[1:19:25] it's the book of the life of the lamb
[1:19:28] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:19:30] right the lamb's book of life so
[1:19:34] it's all about him it's the entire
[1:19:35] revelation of him is in the book
[1:19:37] right do we agree the book is all about
[1:19:42] him
[1:19:43] christ the lamb the book of life of the
[1:19:46] lamb
[1:19:47] the lamb's book of life it's all about
[1:19:49] him
[1:19:50] the entire revelation of jesus christ
[1:19:52] someday he comes forward to get this
[1:19:54] book that he's redeemed
[1:19:55] and all that's in the book would be him
[1:19:58] for that's
[1:19:58] the believer the words in the book and
[1:20:01] the word
[1:20:01] is him amen all of a sudden he did
[1:20:04] something super interesting there
[1:20:06] he made the whole book about the lamb
[1:20:09] but then he made the words in the book
[1:20:10] the believers
[1:20:12] [Applause]
[1:20:14] so the whole book is the book of life of
[1:20:17] the lamb the lamb's book of life
[1:20:19] it's all about eternal life it's all
[1:20:21] about the tree of life it's all about
[1:20:23] the word
[1:20:24] it's all about him he comes to get the
[1:20:27] book and the book is all about him
[1:20:29] all the contents in the book is him but
[1:20:32] when you look at the words in the book
[1:20:33] when you start to separate pieces of the
[1:20:35] body
[1:20:36] amen what are those those are the
[1:20:38] believers so what are the believers the
[1:20:40] believers are the word
[1:20:41] what is the word the word is him amen
[1:20:43] you are
[1:20:44] the book you're part of the book amen
[1:20:47] the book isn't paper
[1:20:48] the book is the life of the lamb amen
[1:20:51] it's christ as he comes down through
[1:20:53] it's christ in noah christ and moses
[1:20:56] christ and abraham
[1:20:57] christ and brother branham christ in you
[1:20:59] the hope of glory
[1:21:01] and if it's christ in you then you're
[1:21:03] the words in the book
[1:21:06] your name is in the book maybe not the
[1:21:08] name that you have now brother branham
[1:21:10] said but who you are
[1:21:11] your position your identity is found in
[1:21:14] this book
[1:21:18] and how does he call your name by
[1:21:21] revealing the mysteries
[1:21:23] and the revealing the mysteries is
[1:21:24] calling the name
[1:21:28] he didn't say chad they say bob
[1:21:31] then say mary what did he say
[1:21:34] he said what happened in the garden
[1:21:39] the reason for a blood sacrifice the
[1:21:41] reason jesus needed to be born virgin
[1:21:44] was because of adultery in the garden
[1:21:47] and you said
[1:21:47] that's true what's he doing
[1:21:50] calling your name what's your name your
[1:21:53] identification
[1:21:54] he's calling your identity because it's
[1:21:58] christ
[1:21:58] calling to christ it's the word
[1:22:02] calling to the word and the only thing
[1:22:04] that can call the word
[1:22:05] is the word the revealed word called the
[1:22:08] predestinated word for that
[1:22:10] day and the two are magnetized to come
[1:22:12] together
[1:22:15] some hear the doctrine of serpentine
[1:22:16] saying that's weird
[1:22:19] you heard the doctrine in a serpent seed
[1:22:20] and even if you said that's weird
[1:22:22] something inside started turning
[1:22:25] and you may have said that's weird i
[1:22:26] don't know i never heard that before
[1:22:28] but all of a sudden you get an
[1:22:29] uncomfortable feeling inside
[1:22:31] that this is might be true
[1:22:35] oh god help me
[1:22:38] i remember that feeling friend something
[1:22:40] in me my brain was saying no my heart
[1:22:42] was saying yes
[1:22:44] my intellect my reasoning my logic my
[1:22:46] training my teaching
[1:22:47] my past history my years in a formal
[1:22:50] church we're all saying
[1:22:52] no way no way no way but something
[1:22:54] inside began to pulsate and the
[1:22:55] heartbeat got stronger and stronger and
[1:22:57] the more i heard it the more i knew it
[1:22:59] was true
[1:22:59] until one day god just dropped the
[1:23:01] revelation in my heart and i said that's
[1:23:02] nothing but the truth
[1:23:04] what was he doing he was calling my name
[1:23:06] how is he calling my name he was
[1:23:08] revealing the mysteries of this book
[1:23:10] amen what was the mysteries of the book
[1:23:12] it's a book of redemption and then he's
[1:23:13] starting to show you
[1:23:14] how you got into the condition you're in
[1:23:17] and how you get out of the condition
[1:23:19] you're in
[1:23:20] because that's redemption you're in the
[1:23:22] condition you're in because you need
[1:23:24] redemption because of a fall
[1:23:26] but but redemption brings me back to the
[1:23:29] place i was intended to be
[1:23:32] and that's what this seven seal mystery
[1:23:34] is all about
[1:23:38] and brother bam said now he had to
[1:23:41] redeem a bride
[1:23:44] i asked you why did he have to redeem a
[1:23:46] bride
[1:23:48] because adam had to redeem a bride
[1:23:54] he declares the end from the beginning
[1:23:57] so in the beginning
[1:24:00] god made a son of man a son of god
[1:24:05] a man a son of god he pulled out of him
[1:24:07] his bride and united the two together
[1:24:10] that was his masterpiece image that
[1:24:13] masterpiece image fell
[1:24:16] god we preached about this several weeks
[1:24:19] ago but just
[1:24:19] just stay with me don't let me lose you
[1:24:22] and you don't lose me let's stay
[1:24:23] together
[1:24:27] god when he made that image he was
[1:24:30] working
[1:24:30] six thousand years labor work speak the
[1:24:33] word let the word work
[1:24:34] work work work created man
[1:24:39] on the sixth day created the beast
[1:24:41] created
[1:24:43] and man said well it's not good that man
[1:24:44] do it alone bring up all the animals out
[1:24:47] of the garden for him the name he names
[1:24:48] them all
[1:24:49] no suitable help me so the only suitable
[1:24:52] help me will be one like him
[1:24:54] one that comes from within him one
[1:24:56] that's part of him same nature
[1:24:58] same life bone of his bone flesh of his
[1:25:00] flesh life of his life
[1:25:02] that's the only one that'll be a
[1:25:03] suitable mate what is god doing
[1:25:05] he's showing the great desire of his
[1:25:07] heart
[1:25:09] in his masterpiece painting what's he
[1:25:11] doing in his masterpiece his great
[1:25:13] masterpiece
[1:25:14] he's showing his inspiration because you
[1:25:17] can't
[1:25:18] make a masterpiece without inspiration
[1:25:21] and he takes out the woman
[1:25:25] and he brings the two back together and
[1:25:27] what brother bam calls the crowning
[1:25:28] act of all of creation
[1:25:32] and then adam says
[1:25:35] this is woman for she's taken on a man
[1:25:37] she shall be
[1:25:38] flesh of my flesh she's flesh in my
[1:25:41] flesh
[1:25:41] bone of my bone she
[1:25:45] is me that's what he was saying
[1:25:49] when he says she's flesh in my flesh
[1:25:50] bone in my bone the two shall be one
[1:25:52] he's saying
[1:25:52] she is me
[1:25:57] and then when that was done god rested
[1:26:01] i assure you god would have never rested
[1:26:03] unless his masterpiece was done
[1:26:06] but his rest was interrupted
[1:26:10] his rest was interrupted because that
[1:26:13] man and woman did not fulfill a thousand
[1:26:15] years
[1:26:16] because in the day you eat there of the
[1:26:18] day you die and they never finished
[1:26:20] their thousand-year day
[1:26:22] but in that day when god was resting
[1:26:24] that the masterpiece was marred by the
[1:26:27] lie
[1:26:28] of the devil by reasoning by lust of the
[1:26:30] flesh lust of the eyes and pride of life
[1:26:32] and that image was marred and god
[1:26:36] if you just allow me to say it this way
[1:26:38] god arose from his rest
[1:26:41] because his rest was interrupted when
[1:26:43] his masterpiece was marred
[1:26:45] and god arose from his rest and started
[1:26:47] over again
[1:26:50] rebuilding the masterpiece
[1:26:53] and god will not rest until this
[1:26:56] masterpiece is done
[1:27:02] god built through the patriarchs
[1:27:06] through the prophets through the psalms
[1:27:08] the prophet was he doing
[1:27:09] he's building back adam
[1:27:12] the bible calls jesus the last adam
[1:27:16] the last item this interesting term the
[1:27:18] last adam
[1:27:20] i want to look at a quote here
[1:27:26] actually if you let me i want to finish
[1:27:28] the quote i never finished
[1:27:29] and then we'll move on but someday he
[1:27:32] comes forth to get this book that he's
[1:27:34] redeemed and all that's in the book
[1:27:35] would be him
[1:27:36] for that's the believer the words in the
[1:27:38] book and the word is him
[1:27:40] and all that's all that's in that he
[1:27:42] come forth for this book of redemption
[1:27:44] whose names are written on the book
[1:27:45] before the foundation of the world
[1:27:46] when he was slain as a lamb and here he
[1:27:49] is today
[1:27:51] in his word manifesting the same thing
[1:27:53] he did there
[1:27:54] she can't recognize another headship no
[1:27:58] sir
[1:27:58] there's no bishop no nothing she
[1:28:00] recognizes one headship
[1:28:02] that's christ and christ is the word oh
[1:28:05] my
[1:28:05] oh i love that yes sir
[1:28:09] he's showing that the headship is here
[1:28:13] now listen it's not a partial headship
[1:28:16] because it's not for a partial union
[1:28:20] but the headship is the full revelation
[1:28:22] of the word
[1:28:24] it can only come at the opening of the
[1:28:26] seven seals so if the headship is here
[1:28:28] the seals are open the seals are open
[1:28:30] the lamb took the book
[1:28:32] loose the seals the headship has come
[1:28:35] the full revelation of jesus christ has
[1:28:37] come
[1:28:37] and now that headship came to do one
[1:28:40] thing that headship
[1:28:41] came to unite in an invisible union with
[1:28:43] a bride
[1:28:46] that's what brother brahm taught us now
[1:28:48] she accepts no other headship but what
[1:28:50] the word
[1:28:51] no creed no denomination no reason no
[1:28:53] lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride
[1:28:54] of life
[1:28:55] no self-reasoning no self-interpretation
[1:28:57] of the word
[1:28:58] she's got the correct interpretation of
[1:29:00] the word with divine vindication
[1:29:02] it's the headship returned back to the
[1:29:04] body and the body and the headship have
[1:29:06] united
[1:29:09] and she'll accept no other headship but
[1:29:11] christ the word
[1:29:13] then he says in the rising of the sun
[1:29:17] he is the one who opened those seals he
[1:29:20] is those seals
[1:29:25] i just want to stop for a minute
[1:29:29] he is the book he is the seals
[1:29:37] and you're the words in the book
[1:29:43] so it's not about if i could just come
[1:29:46] back to this
[1:29:47] it's not about paper it's not about clay
[1:29:50] impressions because he is the seals
[1:29:54] that's not clay impressions friends
[1:29:58] you're the words in the book that's not
[1:30:00] ink on paper
[1:30:02] that is the life of jesus christ an
[1:30:04] attribute from father god that's on
[1:30:06] earth now
[1:30:07] quickened to life by his spirit what is
[1:30:09] that that's the words that's in the book
[1:30:12] of the life of the lamb that was slain
[1:30:16] he said he's the one who opened those
[1:30:17] seals he is those seals
[1:30:19] for the whole word of god is christ and
[1:30:22] christ is the seals that was open
[1:30:24] what is the opening of the seals then
[1:30:26] revealing christ
[1:30:28] so the whole word of god is christ the
[1:30:30] whole bible is the entire revelation of
[1:30:32] christ
[1:30:33] the seals is christ when he opened the
[1:30:35] seals
[1:30:36] he revealed christ
[1:30:39] you realize it's all the same thing
[1:30:42] you're the same thing he's the same
[1:30:44] thing
[1:30:44] the book is the same thing the bible's
[1:30:46] the same thing the seals are the same
[1:30:48] thing
[1:30:50] it's the same thing it's the word it's
[1:30:52] the word of god coming down through
[1:30:54] attribute by attribute word by word
[1:30:56] person by person
[1:30:57] amen coming to manifest that life he's
[1:31:00] predestinated it for
[1:31:01] amen that what is that that's the book
[1:31:04] coming manifest on the earth but it was
[1:31:06] sealed it was hidden
[1:31:07] there was two vines intertwined and then
[1:31:09] it was hidden in moses it was hidden in
[1:31:11] david
[1:31:11] it was hidden amen down to the church
[1:31:13] ages by these two false vines they
[1:31:15] thought it was one
[1:31:16] church they didn't realize it was two
[1:31:17] different groups
[1:31:19] it was all there the book was being made
[1:31:21] manifest the book was being read
[1:31:23] before the people but they couldn't read
[1:31:25] the book
[1:31:26] it was all confused and it was all
[1:31:28] modeled but at the end of time the lamb
[1:31:30] would come the light would come amen and
[1:31:32] he would bring illumination by the
[1:31:34] opening of the seals
[1:31:35] and shine the light on the word so you
[1:31:37] could look back down the trail of the
[1:31:38] word
[1:31:39] and you could see the trail of the lamb
[1:31:41] and the trail of the serpent two trails
[1:31:44] all the way down through the bible
[1:31:48] do you see it it's not about paper it's
[1:31:52] not about clay it's not about who's
[1:31:54] sitting where
[1:31:56] it's about the living reality of god
[1:31:59] wanting to become tangible upon this
[1:32:00] earth
[1:32:01] god wanting to be known in his
[1:32:02] attributes
[1:32:04] god be coming
[1:32:07] and the mystery of that was sealed in
[1:32:09] these seals
[1:32:13] and the message shalom said god took
[1:32:16] thousands of years to fulfill his
[1:32:18] promise of a coming savior
[1:32:20] but remember he knowed it all the time
[1:32:25] when it was coming there were many
[1:32:27] people rose up and tried to be messiahs
[1:32:29] many churches tried to produce messiahs
[1:32:31] but god
[1:32:31] had the time set for his messiah he was
[1:32:34] in no hurry see
[1:32:36] and during the time of this he showed
[1:32:38] many types of messiah
[1:32:39] he showed it all the way from adam to
[1:32:41] messiah first and last adam
[1:32:43] and one of them of the world and the
[1:32:45] other one of heaven one earthly and the
[1:32:46] other one heavenly
[1:32:48] one come down from heaven the other one
[1:32:49] come off of the earth but promise the
[1:32:51] messiah he took
[1:32:52] thousands of years to fulfill him showed
[1:32:54] it in joseph
[1:32:55] exactly what he was joseph betrayed him
[1:32:57] david betrayed him
[1:32:59] when david was rejected king went on top
[1:33:01] of the hill and looked back and wept
[1:33:02] over jerusalem
[1:33:03] as a rejected king that was jesus in
[1:33:05] david
[1:33:06] 800 years later stood upon jerusalem as
[1:33:08] a rejected king and said jerusalem
[1:33:10] jerusalem how oft would i have hovered
[1:33:11] you
[1:33:12] as a hen does her brood but you would
[1:33:13] not
[1:33:15] you see it's all it was jesus in david
[1:33:20] it was the life of the lamb that was
[1:33:22] sealed in the book
[1:33:23] the mystery was hid they didn't
[1:33:25] understand what it was when he says
[1:33:26] uh when he when he stood up on the mount
[1:33:29] of olives and he wept over jerusalem
[1:33:30] they didn't realize he was it was only
[1:33:32] christ the word in david foreshadowing
[1:33:35] what was going
[1:33:36] to take place
[1:33:39] and many brother bam says he tried moses
[1:33:43] and he failed and he tried this one and
[1:33:44] he failed
[1:33:45] realize as the book's coming down it's
[1:33:47] always speaking in present tense and
[1:33:49] free moral agency
[1:33:50] he tried moses and he failed for what
[1:33:52] the restoration of adam
[1:33:54] tried joseph he was perfect but one
[1:33:56] little scratch
[1:33:58] david had an immorality all of the
[1:34:02] prophets failed
[1:34:03] everybody failed moses got drunk or noah
[1:34:06] got drunk
[1:34:06] moses was lifted up in self-will and
[1:34:09] struck the rock twice david had
[1:34:11] immorality
[1:34:12] joseph had one little scratch trying to
[1:34:13] get his father to lie
[1:34:16] he couldn't he couldn't complete the
[1:34:19] first part of his masterpiece although
[1:34:20] they were all typing it foreshadowing it
[1:34:22] building
[1:34:23] building building to a great crescendo
[1:34:27] and jesus would come and he would wrap
[1:34:29] all the pieces that they were building
[1:34:31] into himself
[1:34:33] and he would stand there the full word
[1:34:35] on display
[1:34:37] what god had done on the sixth day when
[1:34:38] he made man
[1:34:40] and it was smart he had come back to
[1:34:42] that place
[1:34:46] but in him was you
[1:34:52] and when jesus died you died in him
[1:34:55] that's what the scripture says
[1:34:59] and and when he rose again you rose with
[1:35:03] him
[1:35:05] because your flesh of his flesh bonus
[1:35:07] bone life of his life
[1:35:10] but he had to finish the masterpiece on
[1:35:12] this earth on display
[1:35:14] so when jesus come forth he couldn't
[1:35:16] take all the attributes although your
[1:35:17] bodies were already laying here in the
[1:35:19] elements
[1:35:20] but each one had to come forth in god's
[1:35:23] great drama
[1:35:24] and portray their part in time and
[1:35:27] display of free moral agency
[1:35:28] as the book of life was being read do
[1:35:32] you understand what i'm saying i'm using
[1:35:33] terms
[1:35:34] i'm taking liberty to use terms to bring
[1:35:36] understanding don't pin me down to those
[1:35:37] terms the book of life being read it was
[1:35:39] sealed
[1:35:39] no it was being read but it was sealed
[1:35:44] nobody knew what was happening nobody
[1:35:46] knew what was happening when the
[1:35:48] when the ephesians church began to grow
[1:35:50] cold and formal and fall they didn't
[1:35:52] know what was happening
[1:35:54] but the mystery was telling what was
[1:35:55] happening because that tree had to go
[1:35:57] into the ground and die and bring forth
[1:36:00] god's law has to continue to unfold
[1:36:03] god's way
[1:36:04] has to be made manifest so god all the
[1:36:06] way through
[1:36:07] try to moses fail trying and joseph
[1:36:09] failed tried in this one and this one
[1:36:11] and this one and this one
[1:36:12] and finally he restored the masterpiece
[1:36:15] man
[1:36:16] he got jesus christ the word on display
[1:36:19] the full word made in flesh
[1:36:21] and he got that part of the masterpiece
[1:36:22] but when he died and rose again
[1:36:24] amen he could not bring forth the whole
[1:36:26] resurrection he had to wait till
[1:36:28] each of those attributes that came out
[1:36:29] of him that came from his life would be
[1:36:32] brought up out of the earth and
[1:36:33] displayed and the seed quickened the
[1:36:35] life
[1:36:35] and take their position in the great
[1:36:37] drama in the great book and the great
[1:36:38] story
[1:36:40] do you understand and so he had to wait
[1:36:45] wait wait and wait
[1:36:49] he couldn't take the book he had to wait
[1:36:52] and wait and wait
[1:36:56] and he had to wait until a cycle of
[1:36:59] redemption completed
[1:37:02] until he came back to a bride that was
[1:37:05] restored to the faith of the fathers
[1:37:09] see brother branham was here calling out
[1:37:12] he was eliezer calling out of rebecca
[1:37:14] for isaac
[1:37:15] he was calling her out of denominations
[1:37:18] out of creeds
[1:37:19] out of dogmas out of false understanding
[1:37:21] what was he doing
[1:37:22] he was gathering for isaac the bride
[1:37:25] pulling her out and showing that she's
[1:37:28] been coming up through luther she's been
[1:37:29] coming up through wesley she's been
[1:37:30] coming up through pentecost
[1:37:33] but when there finally came the second
[1:37:35] part of that masterpiece
[1:37:37] a bride that was restored back to the
[1:37:40] original teaching
[1:37:41] the original faith of the fathers when
[1:37:44] he
[1:37:45] finally got a bride on earth that
[1:37:47] believe serpent seed water baptism in
[1:37:49] jesus name
[1:37:51] that would accept the ministry of
[1:37:52] malachi 4 that would accept the son of
[1:37:54] man ministry
[1:37:55] that would that would accept healings
[1:37:57] and miracles and
[1:37:58] when to accept all when he finally got
[1:38:00] this trick and pulled him out of here
[1:38:01] and shook off
[1:38:02] the false teaching and brought him back
[1:38:04] now the headship could come to the body
[1:38:08] now the invisible union could take place
[1:38:11] couldn't do it in denominations couldn't
[1:38:12] do it with the pentecostal church
[1:38:14] couldn't do it with the wesley church
[1:38:15] couldn't do it with the lutheran church
[1:38:16] he had to wait till the end time
[1:38:18] and at the end time he would send a
[1:38:19] ministry of eliezer and eleazar would
[1:38:21] call out of all of that
[1:38:22] and bring them back to what bring them
[1:38:24] back to the word and when they could
[1:38:26] receive the word
[1:38:27] it was now time to receive the headship
[1:38:32] and he was going to take the bridegroom
[1:38:35] and unite him with the bride
[1:38:39] and until until he was done with
[1:38:42] redeeming through the church
[1:38:44] ages covering through the sins of
[1:38:46] ignorance covering
[1:38:47] for all the false understanding of false
[1:38:49] teaching he had to stay there
[1:38:50] but when this prophet come on the scene
[1:38:52] with the son of man ministry they could
[1:38:53] restore the word
[1:38:54] amen when he could restore the word amen
[1:38:56] now amen
[1:38:58] the bride began to move to the word and
[1:39:00] now jesus can move
[1:39:02] he can now do what he can now claim
[1:39:05] his possession he can now he's sitting
[1:39:08] in intercession there's a dip in the
[1:39:09] holy spirit a portion of the holy spirit
[1:39:11] why because
[1:39:12] the word is not in fullness when the
[1:39:13] word is not in fullness the holy ghost
[1:39:15] is not in fullness
[1:39:17] because the holy ghost is the life of
[1:39:19] the word
[1:39:21] so without the full word there's not the
[1:39:22] full life amen but now he brought a
[1:39:24] prophet down amen and christ is
[1:39:26] sitting here working media mediatorial
[1:39:28] working intercession
[1:39:29] covering for the sins of ignorance why
[1:39:31] he's redeeming a bride redeeming a bride
[1:39:33] redeeming a bride but when the bride
[1:39:35] comes from the feet to the legs
[1:39:36] up through luther up through wesley up
[1:39:38] through pentecost all the way up to
[1:39:40] now i mean she's receiving the mind of
[1:39:42] christ and the revelation of the word
[1:39:44] what did he do he built back a bride for
[1:39:47] christ through the church age
[1:39:48] then brought her out of all the churches
[1:39:50] and brought her to the word
[1:39:51] and now it's the great time that the
[1:39:53] lamb can stand up and take the book
[1:39:55] and what is he doing by taking the book
[1:39:57] and losing the seals he is
[1:39:58] claiming his possession what has he
[1:40:01] always wanted
[1:40:02] the last adam has always wanted the
[1:40:04] bride from his side
[1:40:06] but he couldn't take her and irenaeus he
[1:40:08] couldn't i mean he couldn't take her and
[1:40:10] sardis he couldn't take her through
[1:40:11] luther's age
[1:40:12] he couldn't take her couldn't take her
[1:40:13] couldn't take her
[1:40:15] until finally she's prepared
[1:40:18] under a prophetic ministry she's
[1:40:20] prepared
[1:40:22] and now he can come and claim the book
[1:40:29] he didn't take a piece of paper
[1:40:33] and tear off clay
[1:40:36] what he did is he took the people on the
[1:40:38] earth that would
[1:40:39] believe his word and he claimed them
[1:40:44] and he possessed them
[1:40:47] because the full measure of the holy
[1:40:49] ghost came back to the church
[1:40:52] what was it the headship uniting with
[1:40:54] the body
[1:40:56] the word the word head coming to the
[1:40:59] word body
[1:41:00] in an invisible union
[1:41:04] and they could not take the book until
[1:41:06] there was a bride
[1:41:08] who'd received the malachi 4 ministry to
[1:41:11] turn
[1:41:11] back to the faith of the fathers
[1:41:15] when he saw that now he could come claim
[1:41:17] his possession
[1:41:19] and in claiming his possession he could
[1:41:21] whisper the love secrets to her
[1:41:24] that was kept for six thousand years and
[1:41:26] now at the end time
[1:41:28] he's revealing the seals what's he doing
[1:41:30] he's saying darling i always wanted you
[1:41:32] i've watched over you for 6 000 years
[1:41:37] it's more than just you as an individual
[1:41:39] this is god's whole plan
[1:41:41] you're standing here as an individual
[1:41:43] representing the whole bride
[1:41:46] representing the whole thing all the way
[1:41:48] down through but you had the opportunity
[1:41:50] they didn't have you have the
[1:41:51] opportunity to come to the word
[1:41:52] untainted by man to come to christ
[1:41:55] himself and unite with him
[1:41:58] brother brown says in
[1:42:02] in the message there is only one
[1:42:03] provided there's only one way provided
[1:42:05] by god for anything
[1:42:07] he was god's word made manifest he was
[1:42:09] god's promise vindicated
[1:42:11] he was he was god in a flesh form the
[1:42:14] bible said that god was in christ
[1:42:16] that great jehovah that created heaven
[1:42:18] and earth was made manifest in a body
[1:42:20] the lord jesus and in that one man he
[1:42:22] could achieve
[1:42:23] he tried it through moses he did it in
[1:42:25] jacob and
[1:42:27] and he did it in joseph but he yeah he
[1:42:30] tried it and moses
[1:42:31] he did it and jacob means he tried it in
[1:42:33] jacob he did it and joseph means he
[1:42:35] tried it in joseph
[1:42:36] but he came in his fullness in the man
[1:42:38] christ he was the fullness of the
[1:42:40] godhead bodily
[1:42:42] where god could express himself and he
[1:42:43] said who can who can accuse me of sin
[1:42:46] sin is unbelief if i haven't done
[1:42:48] exactly what the scripture said i would
[1:42:49] do
[1:42:50] then who can condemn me and say where i
[1:42:52] failed in any way
[1:42:53] see it's god's provided way
[1:42:57] he says in the masterpiece from 1964
[1:43:01] now for nearly 2000 years god has been
[1:43:03] again making him a masterpiece
[1:43:06] because he struck adam to get a piece
[1:43:08] off of him part of him
[1:43:09] a rib to make a wife for him and now
[1:43:11] that perfect masterpiece that he struck
[1:43:13] at calvary
[1:43:14] he got a piece off of him it's just a
[1:43:16] new testament that's all
[1:43:18] he fulfilled the old testament now it's
[1:43:20] the new testament another piece to be
[1:43:22] fulfilled
[1:43:23] that's why she's turned back to the
[1:43:25] original faith of the fathers
[1:43:27] back to paul's teaching back to the new
[1:43:29] testament
[1:43:31] it had taken the new the taking the old
[1:43:33] to foreshadow the new
[1:43:35] christ come the masterpiece to fulfill
[1:43:37] that now his bride will fulfill
[1:43:39] everything that's in the new testament
[1:43:41] another masterpiece
[1:43:43] is in making as it taken him four
[1:43:46] thousand years to make his masterpiece
[1:43:48] now
[1:43:48] he's been for nearly two thousand years
[1:43:50] making another masterpiece a bride for
[1:43:52] christ
[1:43:52] another masterpiece in so doing it he
[1:43:55] does it by his never-changing method the
[1:43:57] same way he made the masterpiece
[1:43:59] his word that's the way he makes his
[1:44:02] masterpiece because he can only be a
[1:44:04] perfect masterpiece
[1:44:06] when it's the perfect word
[1:44:13] brother brandon says i don't want to go
[1:44:16] too far here but i want to read this
[1:44:22] what would god call a people out of his
[1:44:24] evil age for
[1:44:26] i'll read that again there's a
[1:44:28] parenthesis in there but i'm going to do
[1:44:29] the whole sentence
[1:44:30] what would god call a people out of this
[1:44:32] evil age for his name
[1:44:34] he's saying why out of this evil age and
[1:44:38] he preaches the god of this evil age
[1:44:40] satan's eaten
[1:44:40] showing that at the end time we've come
[1:44:42] to the pinnacle of satan's eden
[1:44:45] he said why would god call a people for
[1:44:48] his namesake out of this
[1:44:50] that's what the prophet's saying but
[1:44:53] it's for a purpose
[1:44:54] friends now listen i i i've told you how
[1:44:57] he went through the old testament he
[1:44:59] built up and he built up and he built up
[1:45:00] and he got adam and then
[1:45:01] he struck a blow to the last adam
[1:45:03] because he's got to create a bride for
[1:45:05] adam because he foreshadowed it in the
[1:45:06] beginning
[1:45:07] he's got to finish the work now he's
[1:45:10] been building a bride for nearly 2 000
[1:45:11] years
[1:45:12] and when the bride comes on the earth
[1:45:13] pulled out of denominations united to
[1:45:15] the word
[1:45:16] the headship comes and unites the seals
[1:45:18] open the revelation of the mystery
[1:45:19] but now he's got a bride amen just like
[1:45:22] adam had a bride
[1:45:25] but there's got to be a reason that he
[1:45:27] called a bride
[1:45:28] for his name in this age
[1:45:32] he said the reason it is is to try her
[1:45:37] his bride
[1:45:40] see god intends to win
[1:45:45] god intends to overcome all evil god
[1:45:48] intends to reverse what was done in the
[1:45:50] fall
[1:45:51] god intends to have an absolute victory
[1:45:53] in satan god intends to win the battle
[1:45:56] and god is going to do it he he won
[1:45:59] through jesus christ but he's got to win
[1:46:01] through christ's female form
[1:46:05] he's wanting him he's got to win in her
[1:46:09] because she is him flesh of his flesh
[1:46:13] bone of his bone life of his life spirit
[1:46:16] of his spirit
[1:46:18] she is him and why would god call people
[1:46:21] of this evil age for his name
[1:46:23] the reason it is is to try her his bride
[1:46:26] when she has made manifest
[1:46:28] been tried been proven proved to satan
[1:46:31] like it was at the beginning
[1:46:32] so shall it be at the end as the seed
[1:46:35] starts in the ground it comes up through
[1:46:36] carriers the life of them
[1:46:38] but it ends up the same seed that it was
[1:46:40] when it went in the ground
[1:46:42] and the same way the seed of deceit fell
[1:46:44] in the ground in eden is the same way it
[1:46:45] ends up in the last days
[1:46:47] just as the gospel was when it fell in
[1:46:49] the denomination that nicea roman ends
[1:46:52] up
[1:46:52] in a super organization just as the seat
[1:46:55] of the church fell back there with the
[1:46:56] signs wonders and the living christ
[1:46:58] among them
[1:46:58] it ends up in the last day under the
[1:47:00] ministry of malachi 4 and restores back
[1:47:02] again the original faith that was once
[1:47:04] given
[1:47:05] we find now this evil age is to prove to
[1:47:08] satan
[1:47:09] she is not like eve that she is not that
[1:47:13] type of
[1:47:14] woman and she will be tried by his word
[1:47:17] the bride
[1:47:18] as adam's bride was tried by the word
[1:47:21] and adam's bride
[1:47:22] believed every bit of the word all but
[1:47:24] confused on one promise
[1:47:26] oh friends what the prophet says next is
[1:47:29] amazing to me
[1:47:29] because he doesn't say you'll not surely
[1:47:32] die
[1:47:33] he doesn't even go back to that
[1:47:34] scripture he goes to a totally
[1:47:36] different scripture this is going to be
[1:47:39] amazing now listen
[1:47:40] we realize he come up and he restored
[1:47:42] the last adam he struck a blow took out
[1:47:44] of the last adam the ingredients to make
[1:47:46] the last woman and he's been building
[1:47:48] her for 2000 years till he finally gets
[1:47:49] her and he can bring a union a spiritual
[1:47:51] union
[1:47:52] if he brings the invisible union there
[1:47:53] must be a pride that's restored back to
[1:47:55] him
[1:47:56] there must be a headship to unite with
[1:47:57] they've come together
[1:47:59] and now what what's been going on for
[1:48:01] the last 50 some years
[1:48:02] what's the point amen because he let her
[1:48:04] come up
[1:48:05] amen he let her come up in this evil age
[1:48:08] in satan's eden
[1:48:09] to do what to prove to satan she's not
[1:48:12] that type of woman
[1:48:13] just as when adam amen was given a bride
[1:48:16] given eve
[1:48:16] then eve had to go through her testing
[1:48:18] time and in her testing time she failed
[1:48:21] christ has now been given a bride amen
[1:48:23] and she has to go through her testing
[1:48:25] time
[1:48:25] in satan's eden and she's got to prove
[1:48:27] that she'll not
[1:48:28] fall what is your life about what
[1:48:32] are you doing every day what does god
[1:48:34] want from you amen he's showing
[1:48:35] satan that no matter what conditions no
[1:48:38] matter what the world is saying no
[1:48:39] matter what's going on around you
[1:48:41] you'll not back down on the word you're
[1:48:44] not the kind of woman eve was
[1:48:47] for 2 000 years failed on the word
[1:48:49] failed on the word for 6 000 years
[1:48:51] failed on the word failed on the word
[1:48:53] fed on the word but he's brought back a
[1:48:55] bride united to christ and she's going
[1:48:57] through her testing time now
[1:48:59] and she's going to prove she's not god
[1:49:02] is going to prove she's not like eve
[1:49:05] she's a different kind of woman she's
[1:49:08] the one
[1:49:09] that was ordained for this time she's
[1:49:12] the one
[1:49:12] that i have claimed
[1:49:16] she's the one that i have redeemed and i
[1:49:17] have claimed and now i'm coming down to
[1:49:20] possess
[1:49:20] in preeminence it's his claiming
[1:49:24] ministry now
[1:49:26] it's a possessing time
[1:49:33] i want to read this again she will be
[1:49:34] tried by his word the bride as adam's
[1:49:37] bride
[1:49:37] was tried by the word and adam's bride
[1:49:40] believed every bit of the word
[1:49:42] all but confused on one promise you'll
[1:49:44] not surely die
[1:49:45] no all but confused on one promise
[1:49:49] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:49:52] forever
[1:49:55] why would brother branham go to that
[1:49:57] scripture
[1:49:59] when what eve was deceived on the word
[1:50:01] was you'll not surely die but god knows
[1:50:03] you'll be his god
[1:50:05] you'll be as gods on the earth knowing
[1:50:06] good and evil she wasn't deceived
[1:50:09] on that scripture jesus christ the same
[1:50:11] yesterday forever today and forever
[1:50:13] she was deceived on a different one when
[1:50:14] brother branham said she was she
[1:50:16] she believed all
[1:50:19] adam's bride believed every bit of the
[1:50:21] word all but confused on one promise
[1:50:25] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:50:28] forever
[1:50:30] we can't get confused on this promise
[1:50:32] what he was before the foundational
[1:50:34] world he
[1:50:34] is today he's the same yesterday today
[1:50:38] and forever
[1:50:39] he is the word made manifest he was a
[1:50:42] word made manifest yesterday he's the
[1:50:44] word made manifest today
[1:50:46] he'll be the word made manifest
[1:50:47] yesterday she was confused on
[1:50:49] that who christ was she was confused on
[1:50:51] the word when you're confused on the
[1:50:53] word you're confused on christ
[1:50:56] you're confused on who he is
[1:50:59] today see but failed on one promise
[1:51:02] under the temptation of the enemy face
[1:51:04] to face and now the people that's called
[1:51:06] for his name of course
[1:51:07] is his bride she used to come in contact
[1:51:10] again by the same thing
[1:51:12] not by just denominational truth or
[1:51:14] something but every
[1:51:16] word the redemption cycle is brought
[1:51:20] back in adam the redemption cycle has
[1:51:22] brought back
[1:51:23] an eve and now she's in her testing time
[1:51:28] by the word why because god's going to
[1:51:31] prove to satan
[1:51:32] she's not like eve
[1:51:40] in god's power to transform from 1965 he
[1:51:43] says where that seventh morning when god
[1:51:44] looked upon it
[1:51:46] in the creation and he said it's good i
[1:51:48] am pleased with it
[1:51:50] i'm glad i did it it's all now under
[1:51:52] control and i put
[1:51:54] trust in my son and his wife they will
[1:51:57] make make them head of all of it that
[1:52:00] they will watch over it all and see that
[1:52:02] it's all right
[1:52:02] that everything will bring forth of its
[1:52:04] kind now he has the power to do that god
[1:52:06] then said
[1:52:07] well if it's all so good and it can't be
[1:52:09] anything else because it's my own desire
[1:52:11] it's the way i want it and i spoke it
[1:52:13] that way and my words
[1:52:15] has brought it just exactly the way i
[1:52:17] want it and there it is
[1:52:18] it's all good so the bible said god
[1:52:20] rested the seventh day
[1:52:22] from all his works god rested and he
[1:52:25] entrusted it to his son
[1:52:27] and his son's wife and while he
[1:52:29] entrusted it to them
[1:52:30] she got deceived by the word she got
[1:52:33] deceived about christ being the same
[1:52:36] and and was confused on the word and
[1:52:39] fell
[1:52:39] and then god come out of his rest and he
[1:52:41] began making the second masterpiece
[1:52:43] which he's working on for six thousand
[1:52:44] years
[1:52:46] but when this last eve when this bride
[1:52:49] when every member has come in
[1:52:51] and stood the test and proved that she's
[1:52:53] not like eve then we go to the
[1:52:55] next step what is the next step friends
[1:52:59] the millennium when once again god's son
[1:53:03] and his son's wife fulfill what they did
[1:53:06] not fulfill
[1:53:07] in the original they did not live one
[1:53:10] day with the lord they did not
[1:53:12] fulfill the thousand year reign and now
[1:53:14] when this bride stands her test and does
[1:53:17] not fail like he fell
[1:53:18] then we get to go to the next step and
[1:53:20] that next step
[1:53:21] is the god's son and his wife will
[1:53:24] fulfill the day
[1:53:27] he says so in rebel in the revelation of
[1:53:29] jesus christ from the church age book
[1:53:32] he says we then see that when these
[1:53:35] lasts of israel have been joined
[1:53:37] to love to the lord and the enemy has
[1:53:39] been destroyed god will prepare his holy
[1:53:41] mountain his new garden of eden for the
[1:53:43] bride
[1:53:44] and his and her attendance for the
[1:53:45] thousand-year honeymoon upon the earth
[1:53:48] as adam and eve were in the garden and
[1:53:49] did not finish out the thousand years
[1:53:51] now jesus our last adam and his eve true
[1:53:54] church
[1:53:55] will fulfill all the plan
[1:53:58] of god god wanted to take his rest for a
[1:54:02] thousand years and leave
[1:54:04] and trust his creation to his son and
[1:54:06] his son's wife but it was
[1:54:07] marred but god what is the book of
[1:54:10] redemption
[1:54:11] redeeming back to that what is the
[1:54:13] seal's been hiding
[1:54:14] the whole plan of redemption the whole
[1:54:16] plan of christ from that time on
[1:54:18] and before what's he been hiding the
[1:54:20] fact that he went right to work for 6
[1:54:22] 000 years building it back he built back
[1:54:24] adam he struck adam he took out of him a
[1:54:26] bride
[1:54:26] he's been building the bride he's got
[1:54:27] the bride now united with the groom and
[1:54:29] now she's got to take her testing time
[1:54:31] when her testing time is done
[1:54:32] then we'll go back for the thousand year
[1:54:35] rest where god once again
[1:54:37] entrusts his creation to his son and his
[1:54:40] son's wife
[1:54:41] to rule and reign for a thousand years
[1:54:45] how many wants to get there
[1:54:48] if we want to get there we have to first
[1:54:50] pass our testing time
[1:54:53] when you'll be tested on the word tried
[1:54:55] on the word deception will come your own
[1:54:58] self will your own self lust your own
[1:54:59] self desire
[1:55:00] will come in from within yourself your
[1:55:02] own wrong thinking
[1:55:04] the influence of friends the influence
[1:55:05] of the culture your own
[1:55:07] nature is going to try to take the word
[1:55:09] and taint the word
[1:55:10] amen but we've been given a vindicated
[1:55:12] word so that we can stay
[1:55:14] with the word not fall like he
[1:55:17] fell by reasonings and lust and desire
[1:55:20] amen but now we're going to slay
[1:55:22] ourselves and take that word over
[1:55:24] everything else
[1:55:25] over my own desire my own thinking i
[1:55:27] know prophet said this but i think this
[1:55:29] i'm going to get rid of my i think this
[1:55:31] and take what the prophet said
[1:55:33] the word says this i'm going with the
[1:55:35] word and getting rid of my thinking
[1:55:37] eve couldn't do that she went along with
[1:55:39] the reasoning
[1:55:41] but this bride is not like eve i want to
[1:55:43] get to the thousand year reign i want to
[1:55:45] rule and reign with him i want to
[1:55:46] fulfill god's purpose for that original
[1:55:49] creation which was marred we're here now
[1:55:50] to fulfill that but i've got to go
[1:55:52] through the testing time
[1:55:53] first and i've got to leave my lust of
[1:55:57] the eyes
[1:55:58] my pride of life my lust of the flesh
[1:56:01] out of this
[1:56:05] if we want to get there we've got to
[1:56:07] pass through
[1:56:08] the testing time first every
[1:56:11] idea even about this message will creep
[1:56:15] up
[1:56:16] every thought every deception but don't
[1:56:19] worry
[1:56:20] the train car is sealed to its
[1:56:21] destination
[1:56:24] the bride will not be deceived
[1:56:29] may be distracted but not deceived
[1:56:33] may be detoured but not lost
[1:56:36] amen may be corrected but not cast away
[1:56:42] are we doing friends we're in our
[1:56:43] testing time
[1:56:45] we're looking for that last one to come
[1:56:46] in unite with christ
[1:56:48] we're looking to stand the test of the
[1:56:49] word and not fall like he fell
[1:56:52] but to stick with the word let the word
[1:56:54] be right
[1:56:55] and everything else be wrong if we can
[1:56:59] finish that purpose that god had what
[1:57:02] eve could not accomplish
[1:57:03] we are here today to accomplish what eve
[1:57:06] could not accomplish
[1:57:09] and we're not going to do it of our own
[1:57:10] strength and of our own thinking
[1:57:12] of our own will but he who was holding
[1:57:16] the book had the mystery
[1:57:18] and he was holding this book but he was
[1:57:21] holding this book for you
[1:57:24] so it wouldn't be lost to you so it
[1:57:27] wouldn't be kept from you
[1:57:29] so it wouldn't be marred from you he was
[1:57:31] holding this book till there was one
[1:57:32] worthy to take the book
[1:57:33] but the one who was worthy to take the
[1:57:35] book was your husband
[1:57:38] and when your husband took the book and
[1:57:40] loose the seals
[1:57:41] guess what it's your husband's book
[1:57:45] if it's your husband's book it's your
[1:57:47] book
[1:57:50] if it's your husband's life it's your
[1:57:52] life because you've been declared by a
[1:57:54] prophet of god
[1:57:55] bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life
[1:57:58] of his life and
[1:57:59] spirit of his spirit

[1:58:05] you wouldn't get lost
[1:58:07] god was holding he was bride in his hand
[1:58:09] so that she wouldn't be tarred so that
[1:58:11] she wouldn't be made so that she
[1:58:12] wouldn't be separated from his great
[1:58:14] mystery from the mystery that was inside
[1:58:16] of him
[1:58:16] he was holding her he was holding christ
[1:58:19] he was holding the word
[1:58:20] he was holding the whole revelation in
[1:58:21] his hand
[1:58:26] to make sure that at the end time when
[1:58:28] it was union time when it's time to
[1:58:30] stand the great test
[1:58:32] he could take that book and give it to
[1:58:34] his son
[1:58:36] and his son could take it and give it to
[1:58:37] the seven church age messenger
[1:58:39] and that messenger could give it to his
[1:58:40] bride
[1:58:43] and now where's that book that he was
[1:58:45] holding in his hand
[1:58:47] that book is in the bride where is

[1:59:12] revelation

[2:00:03] ever left eternity
[2:00:05] and that train's been traveling down
[2:00:07] through time and as it traveled through
[2:00:09] time it's been displaying
[2:00:10] it's been displaying the life that's on
[2:00:12] the inside
[2:00:14] but at the end time when the lamb took
[2:00:16] the book he opened the seals and he
[2:00:18] showed what was in the train
[2:00:20] and you realized i'm already inside
[2:00:23] i've been inside from the beginning

[2:00:30] amen they fall into a lost condition
[2:00:32] needing redemption
[2:00:33] but he already had it worked out in his
[2:00:35] mind before the foundation of the world
[2:00:38] he already had the plan he already knew
[2:00:40] what he would do and as it came down
[2:00:41] through time in each season he was
[2:00:43] working redemption redemption redemption
[2:00:45] redemption
