[0:00] do you remember he put adam
[0:03] on a covenant do this and not this
[0:08] this and not that touch not handle not
[0:11] taste not but we find out when he
[0:14] started again
[0:15] he started with abraham and
[0:18] in abraham he started him on an
[0:21] unconditional
[0:22] covenant the first man
[0:26] adam was given a law to live by
[0:30] do not touch that touch not
[0:33] but the second man god is rebuilding
[0:41] he's storing him on an unconditional
[0:43] covenant
[0:44] not if you will i have already done it
[0:48] i've blessed you and you you and your
[0:51] seed and so forth
[0:53] after you it was an unconditional
[0:56] covenant
[0:57] that he started with abraham and the
[1:00] reason he
[1:01] starting with abraham giving him an
[1:03] unconditional covenant
[1:05] is because god found that man cannot
[1:08] keep a covenant
[1:10] you and i we cannot keep a covenant
[1:15] he takes god himself to keep his own
[1:17] covenant
[1:18] and when he called abraham just think
[1:20] about abraham like you and me maybe
[1:23] maybe a farmer a hunter when he called
[1:27] him
[1:27] what he expected and wanted from abram
[1:30] was for abraham only to believe
[1:35] and he gave him that opportunity that
[1:38] that that ability to believe him
[1:41] because he was not going to force him
[1:43] and by simply
[1:44] believing what he called him he called
[1:48] him for
[1:49] the rest was upon god
[1:53] he was determined as we believe his word
[1:57] the remaining of what he will do with
[1:59] this bride
[2:00] that's god's determination he will
[2:03] accomplish it without your input and my
[2:06] input
