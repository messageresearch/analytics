[0:03] america as same as here at phoenix and
[0:06] across the world everywhere is a
[0:08] conference of an old-fashioned prayer
[0:10] meeting
[0:10] of a place of where we can get back to
[0:12] the place where brotherly love existed
[0:15] where the spirit of god can come into
[0:17] our hearts and make us so miserable for
[0:19] the things out here that's going on in
[0:21] the world do you know the ceiling angel
[0:23] said put a mark upon those who sigh and
[0:26] cry for the abominations as dead in the
[0:28] city
[0:30] while the investigation judgment's going
[0:32] on to see who is worthy to escape the
[0:35] wrath
[0:36] the angel was to seal only those who
[0:38] cried inside for the abominations done
[0:40] in the city

[1:27] [Music]
[1:28] through the midst of jerusalem
[1:32] and set a mark upon the foreheads of men
[1:34] that sigh and cry

[1:39] has been done
[1:40] in the mist era
[1:55] [Music]
[2:08] a world in total darkness
[2:13] corrupting itself
[2:17] upon its own
[2:20] pleasure they put god on the shelf
[2:25] feeding
[2:27] and feeding
[2:29] on the lust of their minds
[2:33] drifting further and further
[2:39] falling behind
[2:41] not hearing the cry
[2:46] or seeing the
[2:48] signs they just turn their heads
[2:54] across all the lines
[2:57] no fear the judgment

[12:47] voices and sing your praises
[12:49] god now we wait patiently at your feet
[12:52] lord waiting for you to speak back to us
[12:54] lord that portion we have need of today
[12:57] i pray you would take this vessel under
[12:59] your control lord and that you would
[13:00] speak words of eternal life through
[13:03] these lips of clay
[13:04] and you might do all that you intended
[13:06] to do today and you might have
[13:07] preeminence among all of us
[13:09] but we just pray that you would take
[13:11] your place at the head of the table
[13:13] that you would break the bread of life
[13:15] and feed each one of us lord with the
[13:17] portion we need
[13:18] we love you father and we ask that you
[13:20] would have your way
[13:22] in jesus christ's name
[13:24] amen
[13:26] and god bless you all what we're
[13:27] standing let's take our bibles and turn
[13:29] to second corinthians chapter six
[13:32] uh i wanna welcome any visitors that we
[13:35] have and we have a special visitor we
[13:37] have a brother anatoly who's a pastor
[13:39] from uh uzbekistan who's in the state's
[13:42] visiting family so god bless you brother
[13:44] it's good to have you with us so we're
[13:46] looking forward to a time of fellowship
[13:47] with the brother after service and then
[13:49] pray for brother ilia he is translating
[13:52] into russian for the first time he has
[13:54] to do the interpreting so he's in the
[13:56] booth now so we'll pray for our brother
[13:58] amen
[14:00] everybody jumps in and does their part
[14:02] amen
[14:03] uh just want to say how much i enjoyed
[14:05] the wedding on friday amen it was such a
[14:08] privilege amen to see the picture that
[14:11] god painted of holiness and purity and
[14:13] the whole bible on display in one
[14:16] ceremony is absolutely beautiful
[14:19] and you know it's amazing to see the
[14:21] blessings of god in both of these
[14:23] families that have committed themselves
[14:24] to the lord and committed their way to
[14:26] the lord and look what god has done
[14:28] we've got to watch these two young
[14:29] people grow up in front of us we've got
[14:31] to watch them
[14:33] manage their way through life as they
[14:34] grow and
[14:36] and make their own commitment make their
[14:38] own choices make their own stand for the
[14:40] word and then god unite the two of them
[14:42] it's been a pleasure amen it's just a
[14:44] real treat and a real privilege and
[14:46] we're thankful for the golden and the
[14:48] schwartz family and for what you've done
[14:50] to raise these two young people and now
[14:53] they're becoming the strength of the
[14:54] church because the families become part
[14:56] of the strength of the church so we
[14:58] appreciate that
[15:00] amen god bless you all let's read this
[15:02] scripture now in second corinthians
[15:04] chapter six
[15:07] verse four we'll begin in verse four
[15:14] but in all things of proving ourselves
[15:16] as the ministers of god
[15:18] in much patience and afflictions and
[15:21] necessities in distresses and stripes
[15:24] and imprisonments in tumults in labors
[15:28] and watchings and fastings by pureness
[15:31] by knowledge by long-suffering by
[15:33] kindness by the holy ghost by love
[15:36] unfeign
[15:37] by the word of truth by the power of god
[15:40] by the armor of righteousness on the
[15:41] right hand and on the left by honor and
[15:44] dishonor by evil report and good report
[15:48] as deceivers and yet true
[15:50] as unknown and yet well known as dying
[15:53] and behold we live a chastened and not
[15:56] killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing
[15:59] as poor yet making many rich as having
[16:01] nothing and yet possessing all things
[16:05] may may god bless you as you're seated
[16:07] and may god bless the reading of his
[16:09] word
[16:10] we look into this scripture
[16:12] amen i wanted to take and really
[16:14] highlight a few verses out of this
[16:16] passage that we just read and i was
[16:18] meditating on the service and as it came
[16:21] as god began to unfold it to me i was
[16:24] i was thinking of a statement that i
[16:25] heard brother steve golden make a couple
[16:27] times over the last few days and it
[16:29] struck me and god began to work on that
[16:32] in me and brother steve would say i'm
[16:34] sad and happy
[16:37] i'm sad and happy
[16:40] and you think you know that's a paradox
[16:43] how can you have two opposing motions at
[16:45] the same time
[16:46] but i would imagine if you've ever given
[16:48] away a daughter in marriage you've had
[16:49] two opposing motion emotions at the same
[16:52] time
[16:53] sad because there's a transition coming
[16:55] because what you had known as normal
[16:57] what had been comfortable what you have
[16:59] loved and cherished was changing so
[17:02] there's a there's a grief and the change
[17:04] but a happiness and all that you've
[17:05] prayed for and all that you've longed
[17:06] for the prayers that you've prayed for
[17:08] your daughter amen that god would give
[17:10] her a godly husband and that the two
[17:12] would serve god together are coming to
[17:14] pass so at the same time you can be sad
[17:17] and happy
[17:19] amen
[17:20] and so i began to meditate on that and i
[17:22] began to think about our christian life
[17:24] and i i titled this the paradoxical
[17:27] christian life
[17:29] the paradoxical christian life and and
[17:31] and i believe it will become clear as we
[17:33] go through this that you can have two
[17:35] opposing motion emotions two things
[17:38] opposite within you at the same time
[17:40] amen
[17:42] but uh here if we look again at
[17:45] verse 8
[17:47] he said by honor and dishonor
[17:49] by evil reports and good report as
[17:52] deceivers and yet true
[17:55] as unknown and yet well known as dying
[17:57] and behold we live as chastened and not
[17:59] killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing
[18:03] as poor yet making many rich as having
[18:05] nothing and yet possessing all things
[18:08] this is the apostle paul he says we have
[18:10] nothing yet we possess all things we're
[18:12] sorrowful yet we rejoice
[18:14] amen paul knew what it was to abound
[18:17] into a base he knew what it was
[18:19] to have sorrow at the same time he has
[18:22] rejoicing he knew what it was to be
[18:24] called a deceiver yet be truthful to
[18:26] be poor but make many rich he had these
[18:29] opposing factors in his ministry and in
[18:31] his life amen and that was the paradox
[18:34] of our christian life brother ben says
[18:36] in the message paradox
[18:38] the lord
[18:40] add his blessing to the reading of his
[18:41] word i want to take a text out of there
[18:44] for about 30 minutes if i could hold to
[18:45] that a paradox just use that one word a
[18:49] paradox and now according to webster a
[18:51] paradox is something that seems
[18:53] incredible but is true therefore a
[18:55] paradox then would be the same as a
[18:57] miracle a paradox is when something that
[19:00] seems like it just couldn't be the
[19:02] knowledge of the human mind it's all
[19:04] together incredible but yet it's proven
[19:06] true
[19:07] now a miracle would be the same thing
[19:09] for a miracle cannot be explained a
[19:11] miracle is something that happens and
[19:13] you cannot explain it and make it a
[19:15] paradox it's incredible but yet it's the
[19:17] truth now people today a lot of
[19:20] modernists believe that the days of
[19:22] miracles are past they don't believe
[19:23] there's such a thing as miracle but yet
[19:25] i believe that the word is full of
[19:27] miracles
[19:28] i believe the paradox is constantly
[19:31] for instance i believe that every
[19:33] born-again member of the body of christ
[19:34] is a paradox in
[19:36] themselves amen
[19:39] there's got to be more than one amen to
[19:41] that
[19:44] every born-again member of the body of
[19:46] christ is a paradox in themselves
[19:48] i believe each one of you methodists and
[19:50] presbyterian and lutheran that never had
[19:52] experienced the baptism of the holy
[19:54] ghost was in some formal church that did
[19:56] not believe in the genuine new birth and
[19:58] has now received the baptism of the holy
[20:00] ghost is a perfect example of a paradox
[20:04] because something happened to you that
[20:05] changed your whole being and anyone
[20:07] could look at that and know what a
[20:10] paradox is a miracle
[20:12] so every born-again christian is a
[20:14] paradox in themselves let's turn
[20:16] together in the bible to john
[20:18] 16
[20:24] and in john 16
[20:27] i'd like to read just one verse verse 33
[20:30] john 16 and 33
[20:32] jesus now speaking to his disciples he
[20:35] says these things have i spoken unto you
[20:37] that in me you might have peace
[20:40] in the world you shall have tribulation
[20:42] but be of good cheer i have overcome the
[20:45] world
[20:46] here's another paradox in the world you
[20:48] shall have tribulation then he says but
[20:50] be of good cheer how can i be of good
[20:52] cheer when i'm in tribulation that's the
[20:54] paradox of a christian life
[20:56] how can i be happy when i have sorrow
[20:59] how can i have tension and pressure and
[21:01] anxiety and fears and all of these
[21:04] things on the outside but yet i have a
[21:06] solid foundation and unmovable faith on
[21:08] the inside that's the paradox of a
[21:10] christian life
[21:13] this is what we see through the bible
[21:15] let's look at second corinthians again
[21:18] go back to second corinthians
[21:22] chapter four this time
[21:28] in second corinthians 4
[21:30] i'd like to begin reading in verse
[21:33] 6.
[21:36] for god who commanded the light to shine
[21:38] out of darkness has shined in our hearts
[21:40] to give the light of the knowledge of
[21:42] the glory of god in the face of jesus
[21:44] christ but we have this treasure in
[21:46] earth and vessels that the excellency of
[21:48] the power may be of god and not of us so
[21:51] we have this treasure in earthen vessels
[21:54] so that you don't even pay attention to
[21:56] the earth and vessel the earth and
[21:58] vessel can't get any glory for this we
[22:00] have this treasure in earth and vessels
[22:02] that the excellency of the power may be
[22:04] of god and not of us because we realize
[22:07] it's not the vessel it's what's in the
[22:08] vessel amen
[22:11] and we are troubled on every side yet
[22:13] not distressed
[22:14] we are perplexed but not in despair
[22:17] persecuted
[22:19] but not forsaken cast down but not
[22:21] destroyed always bearing about in the
[22:24] body the dying of the lord jesus that
[22:26] the life also jesus might be made
[22:28] manifest in our body
[22:30] for we which live are always delivered
[22:32] unto death for jesus sake that the life
[22:33] also of jesus might be made manifest in
[22:36] our mortal flesh
[22:38] i love that distressed
[22:41] perplexed
[22:42] but not in despair
[22:44] you know sometimes we get so
[22:47] um
[22:48] we get so
[22:50] i i don't know exactly i say we get so
[22:52] discouraged within ourselves and we get
[22:54] so discouraged at ourselves when we
[22:56] become distressed and we become
[22:57] perplexed
[22:59] but but the christian life was not the
[23:02] one in which you never are distressed
[23:03] and you never are perplexed and you
[23:05] never are cast down and you never are
[23:07] persecuted and it's that's not the
[23:09] christian life the christian life is in
[23:11] the midst of all of that going on
[23:13] there's there's a paradox going on that
[23:16] while you're distressed and while you're
[23:18] uh perplexed you're not in despair
[23:20] there's something holding you on the
[23:22] inside that you can go through
[23:23] everything else that the world goes
[23:25] through but you don't identify with that
[23:27] that's not you the you is now the
[23:29] treasure that's in the earth and vessel
[23:32] so we can be troubled on every side
[23:35] but not distressed we can be perplexed
[23:37] but not in despair you know sometimes we
[23:40] get so discouraged at ourselves because
[23:41] we were troubled and because we were
[23:43] perplexed hey look to the other side you
[23:46] were perplexed but not in despair
[23:48] faith held a man persecuted but not
[23:51] forsaken cast down but not destroyed
[23:54] amen let's turn from there to hebrews
[23:57] chapter 11.
[24:02] this is a very very popular portion of
[24:03] scripture i read it many times but it's
[24:06] such an example amen to us we're going
[24:09] to read about the chosen elect
[24:11] predestinated seed of god that god chose
[24:13] in each age and gave a revelation of
[24:16] himself too
[24:18] and we can see
[24:19] that that the chosen of god
[24:21] the way that they had to live in verse
[24:24] 32 it says and what shall i more say for
[24:26] the time shall fail me to tell of gideon
[24:29] and of barack and of samson and of
[24:31] jephthah david also and samuel and the
[24:34] prophets who through faith subdued
[24:36] kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained
[24:38] promises stopped the mouths of lions
[24:41] quenched the violence of fire escaped
[24:42] the edge of the sword out of weakness
[24:44] were made strong waxed valiant and fight
[24:47] turned to flight the armies of the
[24:49] aliens
[24:50] women received their dead raised to life
[24:52] again and others were tortured not
[24:54] accepting deliverance that they might
[24:56] obtain a better resurrection
[24:58] others had trial of cruel mockings and
[25:00] scourging jay moreover of bonds and
[25:02] imprisonment they were stoned they were
[25:04] sown asunder were tempted were slain
[25:06] with the sword they wandered about in
[25:08] sheepskins and ghost skins being
[25:10] destitute afflicted tormented
[25:13] of whom the world was not worthy
[25:17] they wandered in deserts and in
[25:19] mountains and indents the caves of the
[25:21] earth and these all having obtained a
[25:23] good report through faith receive not
[25:25] the promise god having provided some
[25:28] better thing for us that they without us
[25:30] should not be made perfect
[25:34] see these were the elect of god
[25:37] these were the predestinated seed chosen
[25:39] in third generation
[25:41] and they were sawn us under and chased
[25:43] from cave to cave these were the chosen
[25:46] the elect the apple of god's eye amen
[25:49] but the world couldn't recognize it
[25:50] because of the troubles in their life
[25:52] and the distresses and the things that
[25:54] were going on but yet they had a faith
[25:56] inside of them that could believe god in
[25:58] the face of all the obstacles they had
[26:00] something that could take god at his
[26:02] word no matter what was going on amen
[26:04] they were they were perplexed but not in
[26:06] despair so we see that that god's chosen
[26:10] god's election amen is not necessarily a
[26:13] sparing from troubles it's not god being
[26:16] the apple of god's eye being one in whom
[26:18] the world is not worthy
[26:20] the world is not worthy of them the the
[26:23] world that they lived in was not worthy
[26:25] of the ones living there
[26:27] they were they were from heaven amen
[26:29] they were they were attributes of god
[26:32] that were on display part of the family
[26:34] of god and the world was not even worthy
[26:37] of their presence that's how special
[26:39] they were then but but in that
[26:41] specialness they were a paradox because
[26:43] god was watching them god had chosen
[26:45] them god loved them with an undeniable
[26:48] unfailing love yet they were sawn
[26:50] asunder
[26:51] they were thrown in the pits
[26:53] they were persecuted they were tormented
[26:55] some were tortured not giving in
[26:57] what is all of this it's the paradox of
[27:00] god's love it's the paradox of a
[27:02] christian life it's the paradox of the
[27:04] chosen
[27:06] what's amazing is is
[27:08] when these things begin to happen in our
[27:10] lives troubles come and difficulties
[27:12] come the devil comes right in and begins
[27:15] to try to tell the lie that is so far
[27:18] from being biblical he tries to tell you
[27:20] that this is happening because you're
[27:22] not a child of god this is happening
[27:24] because you're out of the will of god
[27:25] this is happening to you for this and
[27:27] this and this reason but all you have to
[27:29] do is just take a brief reading of the
[27:31] bible and in a brief reading of the
[27:32] bible you'll find that if you are if you
[27:35] are uh if you are troubled then you're
[27:38] part of the scripture amen if you're
[27:39] persecuted if you have distresses if you
[27:42] have things going on in your life then
[27:44] you're following the biblical pattern
[27:46] for the ones that god loves of whom this
[27:48] world is not worthy
[27:50] it's not as though god has rolled out
[27:52] the red carpet for all of his children
[27:54] and everything no he's got something
[27:56] he's going to accomplish something in
[27:58] his mind a purpose an objective amen a
[28:00] picture that he's painting a work that
[28:02] he's displaying a minute everybody is to
[28:05] come in their part but we cannot we
[28:08] we we cannot judge our value based off
[28:11] our circumstances
[28:13] we cannot judge our our faith based off
[28:16] our circumstances but on what we believe
[28:19] in the midst of the circumstances not
[28:21] the actions around us but the reactions
[28:23] within us amen
[28:26] let's go back to second corinthians and
[28:28] read another passage of scripture in
[28:30] second corinthians chapter 11.
[28:37] second corinthians chapter 11 and verse
[28:39] 22.
[28:48] are they are they hebrew
[28:51] so am i
[28:53] are they israelites so am i
[28:55] are they the seed of abraham so am i are
[28:57] they ministers of christ i speak as a
[28:59] fool i am more and laborers more
[29:02] abundant and stripes more above measure
[29:05] and prisons more frequent and deaths oft
[29:08] of the jews five times received by forty
[29:10] stripes save one thrice was i beaten
[29:12] with rods once i was stoned thrice i
[29:15] suffered shipwreck a night and a day i
[29:17] have been in the deep and journeyings
[29:19] often in perils of water and perils of
[29:21] robbers and perils by my own countrymen
[29:24] and perils by the heathen in perils in
[29:26] the city and perils in the wilderness
[29:28] and perils in the sea do you think he
[29:30] had perils
[29:34] and perils among false brethren in
[29:36] weariness
[29:38] and painfulness
[29:39] and watchings often in hunger and thirst
[29:43] and fastings often in cold and nakedness
[29:47] beside those things that are without
[29:48] that which cometh upon me daily the care
[29:50] of all the churches
[29:52] who is weak and i am not weak who is
[29:55] offended and i burn not
[29:58] boy what a picture the apostle paul
[30:00] paints
[30:01] was he chosen of god elected of god
[30:04] was the world not worthy of his presence
[30:06] i say he fits right into that category
[30:09] amen he had come from heaven he was part
[30:11] of the scriptures being unfold
[30:13] prophecies laid in the bible of his
[30:15] ministry in the book of isaiah he was
[30:17] there by a direct call from jesus christ
[30:20] himself greatly beloved of the lord
[30:22] chosen of god amen one of the part of
[30:25] the apple of god's eye but yet he had
[30:28] perils in the sea and perils among
[30:30] countrymen and perils in this and perils
[30:31] in that and perils in that but none of
[30:34] the perils would cause paul to doubt his
[30:36] position in christ none of the perils
[30:38] would move him from his confidence in
[30:41] god and who he was and in his
[30:43] relationship with the lord amen that's
[30:45] part of the test that's part of the
[30:46] overcoming that the day and age that we
[30:49] live in friends it's going to get more
[30:51] difficult there's no way around it i
[30:53] mean we look at our brothers and sisters
[30:55] over in ukraine and the and can you
[30:56] imagine the perils that some of them are
[30:58] going through perils to find food
[31:00] shelter protection for their children
[31:02] safety for their women and children amen
[31:05] perils perils perils perils perils but
[31:07] with all the perils it changes nothing
[31:10] amen and who they are it changes not
[31:12] their position in christ none of that
[31:14] has changed
[31:17] and in times may get more difficult
[31:20] amen but we we've been established upon
[31:22] the word of god god has so thoroughly uh
[31:26] revealed to us who we are where we came
[31:28] from what his plan is what he's
[31:30] accomplishing in our lives and where
[31:32] we're going amen and that is the focus
[31:34] of our lives amen whether we suffer or
[31:37] don't suffer whether we have it easier
[31:39] whether we have it difficult none of
[31:41] that matters what matters is the purpose
[31:43] that god had of me before the foundation
[31:45] of the world and who i am in him
[31:49] amen
[31:50] brother branham says in the message
[31:52] uniting time and sign
[31:55] some people tries to introduce
[31:56] christianity that you're free from
[31:58] worry here no he says no you're not
[32:02] you're free from tension oh no you add
[32:05] tension when you become a christian
[32:06] because you was kind of a slop go happy
[32:08] go lucky whatever it was out there not
[32:11] caring what you did but when you have
[32:13] become a real christian every moment
[32:15] you're wondering am i pleasing my lord
[32:17] if i could hear from him it puts you on
[32:19] tension puts you on guard that's what
[32:22] makes you what you are
[32:25] so brother random here is just busting a
[32:27] myth of christianity and it's a myth of
[32:30] the prosperity type of christianity that
[32:33] somehow when you come to the lord now
[32:36] everything's going to be smooth sailing
[32:38] and brother branham just bust that wide
[32:39] open and that is not the case amen it
[32:42] was much more smooth sailing for the
[32:44] apostle paul before he was converted
[32:46] than after he was converted
[32:49] it was much easier for the disciples
[32:51] amen their life was much easier before
[32:54] they met christ then after they met
[32:56] christ just looking carnally at the
[32:58] natural
[32:59] it brought persecution it brought
[33:01] stonings it it brought public execution
[33:07] so we can see that that idea that
[33:10] concept of the laodicean modernistic uh
[33:13] especially american form of christianity
[33:16] is not the gospel it's not true to the
[33:19] scriptures it doesn't match what we've
[33:20] seen in the bible
[33:22] but what we've seen match in the bible
[33:24] is that god can take one of his children
[33:27] quicken them to life and he can place
[33:29] them in any situation in the world and
[33:31] they'll believe amen he can place them
[33:33] under any distress any peril any
[33:36] persecution any trouble amen and they
[33:38] may feel tension they may feel uh
[33:41] anxiety they may feel pressure amen but
[33:44] there's something inside of them that
[33:45] will hold them through it all that they
[33:47] will hold steady through the word of god
[33:49] and god can through them by the faith
[33:52] that he's planted in them overcome every
[33:54] obstacle in this vessel of clay
[33:58] that's the gospel
[33:59] the gospel is not uh you know i've given
[34:03] my heart to the lord i put it in neutral
[34:05] i'm coasting along tell you know i make
[34:08] it to heaven everything's grand now
[34:10] no you just signed up
[34:14] to be used of god in any way that he
[34:16] purposes to display his attributes
[34:20] when we read through the hebrews chapter
[34:22] 11 the heroes of faith we we get to the
[34:25] part where they overcame the mouths of
[34:27] lions they they conquered armies they
[34:29] did all this and did all that but if we
[34:32] just rewind the tape a little bit
[34:34] and find out what it was like i'm sorry
[34:37] most of you don't know what rewind the
[34:39] tape means
[34:45] skip back the video i don't know how do
[34:48] you say that nowadays
[34:52] if we just go back a little bit
[34:54] you find distress
[34:56] anxiety people who didn't know what to
[34:58] do didn't know the solution didn't know
[35:00] the outcome who were crying out to the
[35:03] lord for deliverance and asking god to
[35:04] protect them and watch over them you
[35:06] find people under pressure
[35:09] you find people confused
[35:13] abraham had the promise believed the
[35:14] promise but got a little bit confused on
[35:16] how it would come to pass when his wife
[35:18] you know brought to him a certain
[35:20] idea and he thought well yeah that will
[35:22] probably work and take hagar you could
[35:24] see he believed he had faith but there
[35:26] was a time of confusion amen there were
[35:28] things he didn't quite know he didn't
[35:30] know how it was going to work out he
[35:32] didn't know how it was going to happen
[35:33] amen but he knew god would keep his word
[35:36] he had faith he believed but he didn't
[35:39] understand
[35:40] but we see him as a hero of faith he
[35:42] staggered not at the promise of god but
[35:44] grew strong
[35:47] what was that that was the inner man
[35:50] maybe not necessarily the outer man who
[35:52] wasn't sure
[35:54] when will you have the baby i don't know
[35:56] how will it happen i don't know
[35:58] but it'll happen
[36:01] let's go to romans chapter seven
[36:04] there's something just specific that i
[36:06] want to deal with
[36:07] for a little bit of time now
[36:13] these are the things
[36:15] that we deal with in our lives
[36:18] that
[36:20] if we
[36:22] if we
[36:23] don't
[36:24] remind ourselves of these things from
[36:26] time to time
[36:27] we begin to get weary with life
[36:31] and a little bit disoriented with what's
[36:34] going on in life
[36:35] we can have the word so conceptual that
[36:38] it no longer becomes practical
[36:41] but this gospel
[36:43] works
[36:45] it is conceptual and practical
[36:48] it works in the big picture but it works
[36:49] in everyday life and so we must be
[36:52] reminded of these things constantly
[36:53] because this is a this is you know this
[36:56] message isn't a theory this message is a
[36:58] life
[36:59] it's to be lived by each member of the
[37:01] body day by day it's to be expressed
[37:04] it's to be lived and how it will be
[37:05] lived in the face of adversity and
[37:07] difficulty and perplexing situations and
[37:10] all of these things what is that going
[37:11] to do it's going to draw out the life
[37:13] that's on the inside
[37:15] so we have to know where we stand and
[37:17] have to know what's going on so that the
[37:19] devil we take away the voice of
[37:20] confusion and the voice of doubt and the
[37:23] voice of questioning we take it away by
[37:25] staying grounded in the word and
[37:27] grounded in the message because this
[37:29] message is not charismatic preaching
[37:31] this message is not prosperity preaching
[37:34] i'm so thankful that that god amen when
[37:37] he brought us a message he sent it in
[37:39] the form of a vessel that could be waved
[37:42] over the people to show amen what
[37:44] maturity looks like so that we could see
[37:47] an example of a bride they make coming
[37:49] to maturity and we could see that
[37:51] example in the highs and in the lows in
[37:54] the questions in the need and in the
[37:56] deliverance
[37:58] not just deliverance deliverance
[37:59] deliverance deliverance amen you come to
[38:01] hebrews the chapter the chapter 11 in
[38:04] the book of hebrews and you see
[38:06] overcoming and deliverance and
[38:07] overcoming and deliverance but thank god
[38:10] he wrote the old testament and put all
[38:12] the details in
[38:13] so you can go back and say hey before
[38:16] deliverance come perplexity
[38:20] before the solution there was the
[38:21] problem before they understood they were
[38:24] confused
[38:26] and then you can realize this is the
[38:28] reality and so the prophet of god would
[38:30] come and he would preach a god who
[38:32] delivers a god who heals he would show
[38:34] the supernatural delivering power of
[38:36] almighty god that he is the same
[38:37] yesterday today and forever amen but he
[38:40] would also tell you what was going on in
[38:42] his life when he didn't have the answers
[38:44] when he was even questioning his own
[38:46] ministry and he didn't know the next
[38:48] step and he would get offended at people
[38:50] and get upset
[38:51] when he would get discouraged and get
[38:53] down i am so thankful that we have this
[38:56] kind of message because if it was just
[38:59] in a charismatic way amen there would be
[39:01] no reality there would be no foundation
[39:03] there wouldn't be nothing solid the
[39:05] message would become another fairy tale
[39:07] like like laodicean pentecostalism that
[39:10] everything is wonderful everything is
[39:12] fine and god's a santa claus waiting to
[39:14] pass out gifts
[39:18] but that's not the scripture amen
[39:21] those supernatural deliverance comes
[39:23] through distressing situations
[39:26] those powerful testimonies come through
[39:28] troublesome times
[39:30] that clarity of revelation comes after
[39:33] confusion
[39:34] about the promise
[39:36] so when we are in confusion about the
[39:38] promise or a perplexing situation or are
[39:41] troubling times amen that is the
[39:44] groundwork that is the basis for
[39:47] deliverance amen that is the
[39:49] prerequisite amen for supernatural
[39:51] deliverance and testimonies the
[39:53] testimony that you're going to share is
[39:55] going to come from this perplexing
[39:56] situation
[39:59] so it's not the time to question your
[40:01] sonship
[40:02] it's not the time to doubt god's promise
[40:05] in your life it's not it's the time to
[40:06] get right down to the the nitty-gritty
[40:09] of life and say he knoweth the way that
[40:11] i take and when i am tried i shall come
[40:13] for lord like gold because i was in his
[40:16] mind before the foundation of the world
[40:18] it's not the vessel but we have this uh
[40:21] excellency in the power is in the vessel
[40:25] that the excellency may be of god and
[40:27] not of man
[40:31] and don't forget he that's in you
[40:34] is greater than he that's in the world
[40:37] not you
[40:38] but he that's in you
[40:44] let's look at romans chapter 7
[40:49] and i will begin at verse 14.
[40:59] for we know that the law is spiritual
[41:02] but i am carnal sold under sin
[41:05] for that which i do i allow not for that
[41:08] i would that do i not
[41:10] but what i hate that do i
[41:13] if i if then i do that which i would not
[41:16] i can send unto the law that it is good
[41:18] now then it is no more i that do it but
[41:20] sin that dwelleth in me
[41:23] for i know that in me that is in my
[41:24] flesh dwelleth no good thing
[41:27] for to will is present with me but how
[41:28] to perform that which is good i find not
[41:31] for the good that i would i do not but
[41:33] the evil which i would not that i do
[41:36] now if i do that i would not it is no
[41:38] more i that do it but sin that dwelleth
[41:40] in me i find then a law that when i
[41:43] would do good evil is present with me
[41:45] for i delight in the law of god after
[41:47] the inward man
[41:48] but i see another law in my members
[41:50] warring against the law of my mind and
[41:52] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[41:54] sin which is in my members
[41:57] brother branham refers to this and and
[41:59] somebody asked him a question about this
[42:01] scripture and and the question is in
[42:03] questions and answers from 1964 they
[42:06] referred to romans 7 chapter 7 verse 14
[42:09] to 18
[42:10] and and they they read part of the
[42:12] scripture and then they ask the question
[42:15] after they read that scripture they said
[42:17] this i cannot understand
[42:19] that was the question of brother benham
[42:20] they read romans 14
[42:23] chapter 7 verse 14 to 18 it says unto
[42:26] the law consent to the law that is good
[42:27] but now it is no more i that doeth but
[42:29] sin that dwelleth in me and then this
[42:31] person says this i cannot understand.
[42:34] and brother braden says well they wrote
[42:36] out the scripture that's paul speaking
[42:37] to the romans now he said let me just
[42:40] kind of polish it up so you can see
[42:42] in me is two persons
[42:46] catch what he's saying
[42:48] in me is two persons right
[42:51] one wants to do wrong the other wants to
[42:53] do wants me to do and every time i start
[42:56] to do right then wrong hinders me
[42:58] how many of you people on the interview
[43:00] this afternoon has run that same thing
[43:02] in this morning brother brown had an
[43:04] interview and apparently he was going
[43:05] over the same
[43:06] example the same understanding to the
[43:08] people in the interview they come to the
[43:10] interview because they had perplexing
[43:11] situations
[43:13] things they needed help with they didn't
[43:15] understand or they had trouble couldn't
[43:17] overcome and apparently he was
[43:19] discussing something like this in the
[43:21] interview
[43:23] and he says
[43:25] how many of you people in the interview
[43:26] this afternoon has run that same thing
[43:28] in this morning same thing i spoke on it
[43:29] this morning temporarily
[43:31] you are an outward man which is
[43:33] controlled by six senses you are an
[43:35] inward man controlled by one sense which
[43:36] is faith
[43:38] and this faith disagrees with all six
[43:39] senses that the sixth sense doesn't
[43:41] agree with faith but one is contrary to
[43:43] the other now as long as the six senses
[43:46] agree with faith wonderful but when the
[43:48] sixth sense is disagree with faith then
[43:50] leave the senses alone
[43:52] now for instance here jesus made a
[43:54] statement a promise the inside man says
[43:56] that's true the outside man reasons that
[43:59] it can't be true to you
[44:01] then ignore the outside men and accept
[44:03] the inside man
[44:04] now that's the same thing that paul
[44:06] speaking of he was sold under the law to
[44:08] carnal sin every one of us is the same
[44:11] that's the reason we have the troubles
[44:12] we do
[44:14] of married four or five times this that
[44:16] and all kinds of sin and adulteries and
[44:18] everything else along in our lives is
[44:19] because of those things we are carnal
[44:21] and that part must perish but then
[44:23] inside we are a spirit man soul inside
[44:26] and that's faith in god's word then we
[44:29] bring our outside body under subjection
[44:31] to the word by faith by accepting what
[44:34] god
[44:34] said now this is what i want you to pay
[44:37] close attention to
[44:38] how can i take a cocklebur and make a
[44:41] grain of wheat out of it it's impossible
[44:43] for me to do it the only way it can be
[44:46] is because inside that cocklebur has
[44:48] been transmitted from a cockapoo wheat a
[44:50] cocker bird to a germ called wheat life
[44:54] so he said how can i change the
[44:55] cockroach i can't change it but i can
[44:57] take and the life that's in the inside
[44:59] of that cockleboro plant i can put a
[45:01] wheat germ a wheat life inside of it now
[45:04] listen to what he says
[45:05] then you bury that cockle burn to
[45:07] produce a grain of wheat that's right
[45:08] see because there has been a life of
[45:10] wheat put in the cockleboro
[45:12] and the life of the cocklebur has been
[45:14] taken out but the nature of the
[45:16] cocklebury is still sticky
[45:18] he's talking about the outside of the
[45:20] plant inside's wheat life now but the
[45:22] outside is still sticky
[45:25] i'll read that again and the life of the
[45:27] cocklebury has been taken out but the
[45:28] nature of the cocklebur is still sticky
[45:31] and it will be until this new life has
[45:33] been fully developed out of the ground
[45:35] and raised up again when it comes forth
[45:38] then it's no more cocklebur
[45:40] but wheat
[45:41] but while it's here on earth
[45:44] out of the earth a over it's still
[45:46] sticky but it's got the nature on the
[45:48] inside of it of wheat
[45:50] and as long as you're in this life
[45:52] you're going to be sticky and have a
[45:54] carnal nature that's going to bother you
[45:57] as long as you live
[46:01] oh
[46:04] that explains it
[46:07] but the inside of you you're born again
[46:13] and when you're raised up you're in the
[46:15] likeness of christ and all sin is gone
[46:17] from you that's the thing
[46:20] brother branham just explained our
[46:22] mysterious lives
[46:24] when you're born again that that nature
[46:27] of the caulker bird dies and is taken
[46:29] out and the the nature of the life of
[46:31] the wheat is on the inside and now that
[46:33] wheat life is to dominate the outside
[46:35] but the outside is still cockleburn
[46:38] and when we're born again amen the very
[46:41] life of jesus christ amen that that
[46:43] attribute of god is quickened the life
[46:45] it's wheat life on the inside and when
[46:47] it goes down in death when it comes out
[46:49] of the ground it'll come forth amen
[46:51] perfect wheat life amen this will be
[46:53] formed in the perfect wheat life but
[46:56] until then as long as brother bam said
[46:59] as long as you're you're in this life
[47:01] you're going to be sticky and have a
[47:02] carnal nature that's going to bother you
[47:04] as long as you live but the inside of
[47:06] you you're born again
[47:08] so i can be born again on the inside by
[47:11] the new birth by the baptism holy ghost
[47:13] and on the outside i can still be
[47:15] troubled by an old carnal nature about
[47:17] that old sticky cockleburn nature on the
[47:19] outside that's what the prophet of god
[47:21] taught us and that's his explanation of
[47:23] romans chapter 7.
[47:26] so that we would not be deceived by the
[47:29] devil amen so that we would understand
[47:32] god has so made it clear to us that we
[47:35] won't trip over our own feet but when we
[47:37] begin to stumble around in the outer man
[47:39] we say wait a minute that's not who i am
[47:43] that's not me amen that's what this is
[47:46] the package that i came in in this life
[47:48] amen but me is the me down on the inside
[47:51] and me on the inside doesn't like that
[47:53] doesn't want that
[47:55] amen the me on the inside wants only the
[47:58] word of god believes god amen doesn't
[48:00] doubt god doesn't question his word has
[48:03] peace has love has joy has long
[48:05] suffering has all of these things so
[48:07] that you can become a paradox where on
[48:10] the outside you can have sorrow
[48:12] perplexity confusion distress even down
[48:15] but on the inside you can have a solid
[48:17] rock of faith and peace and joy that
[48:19] never passes away
[48:22] so that you become a paradox that this
[48:24] christian life is a paradox where you
[48:26] can have two opposing emotions going on
[48:28] inside of you at the exact same time
[48:30] where you can be weeping but you know
[48:32] everything's all right
[48:35] you can be afraid but you know you're
[48:37] safe
[48:41] if that's not true then who are we amen
[48:44] what are we
[48:46] you can you can i mean
[48:49] when when you get a call or you see an
[48:52] accident and you see one of your
[48:54] children fall off of something or in a
[48:56] terrible kind of accident amen you
[48:58] cannot stop the outside reaction
[49:02] there can be fear there can be
[49:03] perplexity anxiety stress and all of
[49:06] these things but there's something else
[49:08] down on the inside that knows it's going
[49:10] to be okay
[49:12] there's a faith that doesn't go away
[49:14] it's there
[49:16] and if we understand those things then
[49:18] we don't let those things slow us down
[49:20] hinder us stop us from our progress
[49:23] and serving god accomplishing what he
[49:25] called us to accomplish in this day
[49:28] brother banham goes down a little bit
[49:30] further in questions and answers and
[49:32] starts talking about the indian that was
[49:34] converted that he called chief
[49:36] and they asked him how he's doing and
[49:38] somebody told me
[49:39] uh one time he was converted received
[49:41] the holy ghost and he said to him how
[49:43] are you getting along
[49:44] he said pretty good pretty bad
[49:49] he had limited language so he just got
[49:51] down to the nitty-gritty
[49:53] pretty good and pretty bad
[49:55] he said well how do you mean pretty bad
[49:57] and pretty good
[49:59] he said well since me received the holy
[50:01] ghost he said there's been two dogs in
[50:02] me
[50:03] one of them black and one of them white
[50:06] and said they argue all all the time
[50:08] said they growl and fight at one another
[50:11] he said the white dog wants me to do
[50:12] good the black dog wants me to bad
[50:16] he said well chief which one of them
[50:18] wins the fight
[50:19] said that depends on which one chief
[50:21] feeds the most
[50:23] so i think that's a good answer there
[50:24] see there just depends on the warring of
[50:27] the body that's in you it depends on
[50:29] which one you cater to
[50:32] which nature you cater to the carnal
[50:34] nature after the things of the world or
[50:35] the spiritual nature after the things of
[50:37] god that does it oh i love how the
[50:41] prophet of god can take something and
[50:43] boil it down so simple amen in such a
[50:45] simple way that if we just apply this in
[50:48] the simplicity it's given we will have
[50:50] victory upon victory upon victory upon
[50:52] victory in our lives
[50:55] amen because why not because trouble
[50:57] goes away but because we understand
[51:00] what's happening
[51:01] amen not because all of the reactions in
[51:04] our flesh all of a sudden stop amen i i
[51:07] mean i haven't become a super duper
[51:08] christian because i never ever have any
[51:11] anxiety anymore
[51:14] no
[51:15] i become a more mature christian when
[51:16] the anxiety does not identify me and it
[51:18] doesn't scare me anymore
[51:22] brother branham even talked about this
[51:24] nervous condition he said he goes he
[51:25] goes i've been nervous since i was a
[51:27] child
[51:29] and he said
[51:30] he said it used to scare me
[51:33] that right
[51:34] that nervous condition that would come
[51:36] upon him and then then he would get this
[51:38] real weary feeling and and and it would
[51:40] make him sour at his stomach and he had
[51:42] all of this he had to leave the field
[51:44] even before he said it used to scare me
[51:47] but he said it don't scare me no more he
[51:50] said i can just feel that it's there
[51:55] but it don't scare me anymore
[51:58] see
[52:00] we can realize that there's a cockleburn
[52:02] nature that's still there
[52:04] but don't let it scare you anymore
[52:07] you can tell that sometimes stress rises
[52:10] and anxiety will come up in situations
[52:13] but don't let that scare you anymore
[52:16] don't give in to that amen don't pay
[52:18] attention to it because when you pay
[52:20] attention to it anything you focus on
[52:22] expands
[52:23] and if you expand on the stress and
[52:25] expand on the anxiety and expand on the
[52:27] confusion then that thing will expand in
[52:29] your life and begin to overwhelm you but
[52:31] it matters what nature you cater to and
[52:34] you say that's just the outer me god
[52:36] will take care of that when my atoms
[52:38] change i'm not even paying attention to
[52:40] it because there's a promise in the word
[52:42] and i'm focusing my attention on that
[52:44] and listen when we begin to do that
[52:46] those things lose their power to control
[52:49] us anymore
[52:52] he goes on to say in the same questions
[52:54] and answers this is a dying spirit and a
[52:56] dying body
[52:58] but now you can't be in two bodies at
[53:00] one time but there can be two natures in
[53:02] you at one time
[53:04] now
[53:05] listen closely to this next thing that
[53:08] brother brown says all the way back in
[53:09] demonology physical realm from 1953
[53:13] he says many times you can see a person
[53:15] maybe of insanity
[53:18] now they may be yet a converted person
[53:20] filled with the holy spirit and yet be
[53:22] totally insane
[53:25] catch this
[53:27] that's right that has nothing to do with
[53:30] the soul
[53:33] it's a torment or see something that
[53:34] torments them
[53:36] it's torment in the outer man because
[53:38] the outer man is your mind and your body
[53:42] right
[53:43] and the tormentor can be tormenting your
[53:45] outer man and it has nothing to do with
[53:48] your soul
[53:50] the prophet of god says you know they
[53:52] can be totally insane
[53:54] and yet a converted person filled with
[53:57] the holy spirit now if we're believing
[53:59] in charismatic laodicean
[54:02] american type of christianity then we
[54:05] would never accept that you could have
[54:07] the holy ghost and be tormented of an
[54:08] evil spirit amen in your mind and in the
[54:11] outer man
[54:13] but the prophet of god told us
[54:14] differently
[54:16] amen
[54:17] and so now when we realize that these
[54:20] emotions sometimes that swirl through me
[54:23] that is not my soul
[54:27] my psyche is not my soul
[54:32] listen do you realize how delivering
[54:34] that is friends
[54:36] what delivering power there is in that
[54:38] truth that my psyche is not my soul amen
[54:41] there can be perplexity distress and
[54:44] torment going on in my mind amen and if
[54:46] you if you've never had torment going on
[54:49] in your mind just live a few more years
[54:51] amen it's going to happen you're going
[54:53] to come under a stress and perplexity
[54:55] and torment in your mind amen but don't
[54:57] ever let that become your identity don't
[54:59] ever that's just the caulker burn nature
[55:01] you were born into that comes from the
[55:03] the names associated with your birth
[55:05] certificate but it has nothing to do
[55:07] with your new birth nothing whatsoever
[55:09] to do with your new birth
[55:17] you know the prophet of god just does
[55:18] things
[55:19] with the word that absolutely destroys
[55:24] wrong understanding
[55:28] even brother brahm told us a story he
[55:30] was told a story about a minister one
[55:32] time that had enough and he tore up his
[55:35] preaching papers threw him in the trash
[55:37] and went out and bought a case of beer
[55:38] and the next sunday sat down and drank
[55:40] that beer
[55:42] and then he died
[55:45] and
[55:45] all of us would have been like poor
[55:47] backslidden creature going to hell
[55:51] my my armenian style pentecostalism i
[55:54] grew up in
[55:56] that would have been what would have
[55:57] happened that would have been our idea
[55:59] our concept but brother branham said see
[56:03] god just had to take his child home
[56:06] he couldn't take it anymore
[56:12] it doesn't it doesn't make sense to the
[56:14] carnal mind
[56:16] but brother branham understood things in
[56:18] a whole different level than we
[56:20] understand them
[56:22] now i'm not suggesting you go
[56:24] have at it
[56:28] that was i think a unique situation
[56:31] but
[56:33] brother ben would never make
[56:36] the outside man the identity
[56:38] of the inside man
[56:41] but we believe with all of our heart
[56:43] that the quickening power on the inside
[56:45] will bring this outside man subject to
[56:47] the inside we believe that with all of
[56:48] our heart that the outside man will
[56:50] reflect the life of jesus christ that's
[56:52] the gospel that's the message that's the
[56:54] bible too
[56:55] so this is no past for living any way
[56:57] you want that's not christianity either
[57:01] but we have to understand that when when
[57:02] the outside man sends us the wrong
[57:04] signals that's not who i am
[57:07] and i don't have to accept it as me and
[57:09] i don't have to cater to it i don't have
[57:11] to live that because my psyche is not my
[57:13] soul it is not who i am and when we can
[57:16] get come to terms with that then all of
[57:18] a sudden we can be absolutely free from
[57:20] the torment that comes by thinking this
[57:23] thought is me
[57:25] that this thought is me this is my
[57:27] identification and i'm this and i'm that
[57:29] no you're a born-again child of god if
[57:32] you've received the baptism of the holy
[57:34] ghost and god has quickened that seed of
[57:35] life to life you are a child of god
[57:38] never to be lost never to be removed
[57:41] from his hand
[57:44] and whatever happens in the psyche god
[57:46] can fix that
[57:49] amen
[57:51] but the soul
[57:53] has nothing to do
[57:55] with the outer man
[57:58] the soul is to take dominion over the
[58:01] outer man
[58:02] that's why it matters which nature we
[58:04] cater to
[58:06] we cater to the nature of the soul the
[58:09] inner man after the new birth and it'll
[58:11] begin to bring this outer man's subject
[58:15] it'll be green to change the thought
[58:17] process subject to the word of god it'll
[58:19] take a stressful situation and then all
[58:22] of a sudden the the the life on the
[58:24] inside will begin to bring it subject
[58:26] amen the anxiety bring it subject by
[58:29] what by faith in the word of god by
[58:31] standing on the promise by believing
[58:33] amen i i've been in some stressful
[58:35] situations where i've been perplexed and
[58:38] tormented and just troubled in the
[58:40] emotional realm and i'll play a tape and
[58:42] all of a sudden by the end of the tape
[58:43] that stuff's gone
[58:46] but what if i didn't amen what if i
[58:48] didn't cater to the inside man and i
[58:50] kept sitting and fixating on my trouble
[58:52] and oh why am i thinking this and why am
[58:54] i doing that maybe i'm this and maybe
[58:56] i'm that and all that when all i did is
[58:58] went to the word and in the atmosphere
[59:00] of the word under the voice of the
[59:02] seventh angel all of a sudden the psyche
[59:04] begins to fade away
[59:06] and all of a sudden the reality it's
[59:08] like the it's like the uh um
[59:11] the prodigal son he came to himself all
[59:14] of a sudden under the preaching of the
[59:15] word i realized hey that's nonsense
[59:18] that's not the truth amen this is the
[59:20] truth and all of a sudden that fades
[59:22] away
[59:25] so we cannot let the culkeber nature
[59:28] define us and we cannot cater to it in
[59:30] any way
[59:32] listen to what the prophet of god says
[59:36] he begins to talk to his church he says
[59:37] we're just a bunch of home folks this
[59:39] morning
[59:40] said i'm homesick i want to go home and
[59:42] i don't know where to go
[59:45] you say what about going in arizona your
[59:47] family's there i'm all right for two or
[59:49] three days and i got to go somewhere
[59:51] else
[59:52] and i go there and then i'm all right
[59:53] there two or three days and i got to go
[59:55] somewhere else so there just ain't no
[59:57] home to go to and i'm
[59:58] homesick well there is a home i'll go to

[1:00:45] want to get to them all together one of
[1:00:47] these days father will and then we'll
[1:00:50] have a home where we won't have to roam
[1:00:52] around no more i get tired rambling and
[1:00:55] no place to stay
[1:00:58] and i'd advise anybody never be a
[1:01:00] rolling stone unless it's some kind of a
[1:01:03] ministry that calls you to that because
[1:01:05] i just give anything this morning if i
[1:01:07] had a place here on earth that i could
[1:01:08] go and say this is home
[1:01:10] if i had it i'd give a million dollars
[1:01:12] if i had a place that i could say boy i
[1:01:14] just love this so well i don't want to
[1:01:16] leave it no more i'd give anything but i
[1:01:19] can't find it
[1:01:21] i'm something like abraham was i'm
[1:01:22] looking for a city i can't find it but i
[1:01:25] know it's there but i certainly can't
[1:01:26] get adjusted to any certain place on
[1:01:28] this earth it just looked like fine
[1:01:30] people find places and you go there it's
[1:01:32] too wet go out there it's too dry go up
[1:01:34] here it's too cold go down there it's
[1:01:36] too hot
[1:01:37] and there's no place that just ain't
[1:01:38] home don't make up my
[1:01:41] i don't make up my time crying on your
[1:01:43] shoulder
[1:01:45] but well
[1:01:46] we're thankful to the lord amen be
[1:01:49] thankful for all things i'm thus because
[1:01:51] i am thus
[1:01:52] god made me what i am
[1:01:55] and i can't be nothing but what he made
[1:01:57] me
[1:01:58] melancholy
[1:02:01] and those kind of things
[1:02:03] they tell me i just have to be that way
[1:02:05] in order
[1:02:06] to be the help that he sent me here to
[1:02:08] be
[1:02:09] and i want to be that kind of person if
[1:02:11] that's the way i was supposed to be
[1:02:13] that's what i want to be whatever the
[1:02:15] kingdom of god's will or god's will
[1:02:17] that's what i want to be brother brennan
[1:02:20] when just a home folks he begins to
[1:02:21] break down some of his own temperament
[1:02:23] and the old things he struggles with
[1:02:26] he can't settle down he can't find a
[1:02:28] place of rest he's got that rambling
[1:02:30] spirit and he's nervous and he tells in
[1:02:33] another place i get nervous and just
[1:02:35] have to go and he gets gets he gets
[1:02:37] weary he gets wore down he can't settle
[1:02:39] down he's got this melancholy and he
[1:02:41] says god made him that way for for us
[1:02:45] he made him that way so he'd go from
[1:02:47] place to place begins begins to break
[1:02:49] down that that there's things that he
[1:02:51] struggles with god uses that that nature
[1:02:55] to serve his purpose but it also created
[1:02:57] a struggle for the prophet of god
[1:03:00] the thing that god was using for our
[1:03:01] benefit and for the benefit of the
[1:03:03] people in that day amen is also
[1:03:05] something that becomes problematic for
[1:03:07] the prophet and something he has to deal
[1:03:09] with
[1:03:11] it's the
[1:03:12] it's the uh perplexity it's the
[1:03:15] paradox of our christian life that god
[1:03:19] looked after us and then he looked after
[1:03:20] our grandparents and our parents amen to
[1:03:22] get this one amen matched up with this
[1:03:25] one to get a certain character to get a
[1:03:26] certain set of traits amen so that each
[1:03:29] each bell would have a certain ting to
[1:03:31] it
[1:03:32] remember the prophet talking about that
[1:03:34] when they mixed the bell so many alloys
[1:03:36] so much ten and so much copper amen to
[1:03:38] make it give us just a certain pitch and
[1:03:40] he did our lives that way amen where did
[1:03:42] he do that in the carnal things
[1:03:45] and the carnal things and what's what's
[1:03:48] what's in the sticky culkeber nature
[1:03:50] amen god built it in such a way that he
[1:03:53] could get an expression out of you and i
[1:03:55] he could get a certain work a certain
[1:03:57] thing out of you and i but it's the very
[1:03:59] thing that god's using for his purpose
[1:04:01] is the very thing that's causing us
[1:04:02] trouble
[1:04:06] amen
[1:04:08] it's it's perplexing sometimes
[1:04:12] sometimes
[1:04:13] you hate the way that you're made
[1:04:15] has anybody ever hated the way you're
[1:04:16] made
[1:04:18] but you can't hate it too much because
[1:04:20] god intended you to be that way for his
[1:04:22] purpose
[1:04:24] how can these two things be uh going on
[1:04:27] simultaneous in our lives that i hate
[1:04:30] the way that i am i've never met anybody
[1:04:31] says i really just admire
[1:04:35] the way that i am like my personality
[1:04:38] and that's not somebody i'd stay away
[1:04:41] from
[1:04:44] but brother bram said my greatest enemy
[1:04:46] is william branham
[1:04:48] i look him in the face in the morning
[1:04:50] and that's the one i'm fighting with
[1:04:51] he's the one that's always getting in
[1:04:53] god's way he's the one getting in god's
[1:04:55] way but god built him with a certain
[1:04:57] fashion so god could use him to go his
[1:04:59] way
[1:05:01] he made him melancholy but melancholy is
[1:05:03] what brother branham got spanked for
[1:05:06] he was corrected from god for being
[1:05:08] melancholy and building up a complex but
[1:05:11] god made him that way so god could use
[1:05:13] him to preach the gospel a certain way
[1:05:17] so there's a paradox in our lives
[1:05:19] there's a paradox in our outer man and
[1:05:22] the paradox is that god saw to it to
[1:05:24] have you shaped and fashioned a certain
[1:05:26] way amen so that he could work his plan
[1:05:28] through your life but the paradox is
[1:05:30] it's the very same realm in which god
[1:05:33] ordained to be a certain way for his
[1:05:35] service is the very thing that keeps
[1:05:36] tripping you up and causing you all your
[1:05:38] problems
[1:05:40] so you hate the way you are but you
[1:05:42] better be careful on how much you hate
[1:05:44] it
[1:05:45] because god chose it that way
[1:05:48] right
[1:05:49] sometimes we you know somebody brother
[1:05:51] bam said sometimes you know people are
[1:05:54] you know john had a certain nature the
[1:05:56] apostle john he was always you know
[1:05:59] gentle and he was sensitive and he was
[1:06:01] he was close to jesus he was the one
[1:06:03] laying on his breast he said but peter
[1:06:04] he was more boisterous and bold and
[1:06:06] brash
[1:06:09] which one was better
[1:06:12] which one served god's purpose better
[1:06:16] which one would you say you know now
[1:06:19] paul or you know peter you should act
[1:06:21] like
[1:06:22] john now john
[1:06:24] if it was us we'd be like okay i'll mix
[1:06:27] a little bit of john and with a little
[1:06:29] bit of paul and with a little bit of
[1:06:31] peter
[1:06:32] and if we get him just right then that
[1:06:34] that's what i would want to be but god
[1:06:37] needed peter to be peter and he needed
[1:06:38] john to be john
[1:06:40] and he needs you to be you
[1:06:44] so there's a paradox in you
[1:06:46] you're a walking paradox
[1:06:49] between the inner and outer round but
[1:06:50] there's a paradox in the outer realm
[1:06:54] i say god
[1:06:55] help us
[1:06:57] help us just to surrender and say god
[1:06:59] have your way i can't figure it out i
[1:07:01] don't understand it i would have made me
[1:07:03] this way
[1:07:05] but you did
[1:07:08] some people never talk some people never
[1:07:10] stop
[1:07:12] talking some people are real outgoing
[1:07:15] unfriendly some people are real quiet
[1:07:16] and thoughtful
[1:07:18] and it takes all of them
[1:07:20] to fulfill god's purpose
[1:07:23] the person who's really quiet and
[1:07:25] bashful deep in thought they wish that
[1:07:27] they could be more outgoing and open and
[1:07:29] have all the friends and the person who
[1:07:30] talks all the time is the one who goes
[1:07:32] home and says why do i always run my
[1:07:34] mouth why can't i shut up
[1:07:37] the person who's always quiet says why
[1:07:39] couldn't i just said what was on my mind
[1:07:41] it would have helped them
[1:07:46] we're a paradox friends
[1:07:49] but when we understand these things we
[1:07:50] begin to realize
[1:07:52] this is god's doing
[1:07:54] i'm just going to cater to the inner man
[1:07:57] i'm going to stay by this word and let
[1:07:58] god sword i can't figure it all out
[1:08:01] i can't i can no more change me than i
[1:08:03] can make the moon rise earlier i can i
[1:08:05] can't do anything i am what i am by the
[1:08:08] grace of god and by what god wanted i
[1:08:10] wish i could change it i can't change it
[1:08:12] i wish i could be more like this and
[1:08:13] more like that i see people preach and
[1:08:15] i'm like why can't i preach like that
[1:08:18] why can't i when i i mean that was so
[1:08:21] nice
[1:08:24] but you can't you can only be what you
[1:08:25] are and you say you know what it's in
[1:08:27] god's hands i'm not going to worry about
[1:08:29] it anymore but i know who i am by the
[1:08:31] grace of god and i know he's called me i
[1:08:33] know he's working in me and i know
[1:08:35] anything wrong he'll work out of me i'm
[1:08:37] not paying attention to the outer man
[1:08:39] i'm focusing on this word and the inner
[1:08:41] man and i'll let god sort it all out
[1:08:44] if not we're always depressed we're
[1:08:46] always anxious we always hate ourselves
[1:08:48] we always hey forget about it just serve
[1:08:50] god and let god take care of those
[1:08:52] things all of it's going to work for his
[1:08:54] glory
[1:08:58] let me find
[1:08:59] let's read psalms 142. i just want to
[1:09:02] read
[1:09:04] a couple more places here but let's go
[1:09:06] to the book of psalms
[1:09:11] chapter 142.
[1:09:18] if you look at david david
[1:09:21] was a paradox
[1:09:24] he was anointed to be king of israel
[1:09:27] he was anointed by a mighty prophet he
[1:09:29] was the anointed king of israel
[1:09:33] and under the power of that anointing
[1:09:35] and the faith that he had he could kill
[1:09:37] a bear he could kill a lion he could
[1:09:39] kill goliath when the rest of the army
[1:09:41] was terrified i mean look at what
[1:09:43] anointing was in his life
[1:09:46] the anointed king of israel
[1:09:49] and the anointed king of israel is
[1:09:51] running scared for his life from cave to
[1:09:53] cave decay crying unto the lord
[1:09:56] weeping writing psalms asking for
[1:09:59] deliverance and asking for help and he's
[1:10:01] the anointed king of israel with enough
[1:10:03] anointing to slay his ten thousands
[1:10:06] and now he's in trouble amen and he's
[1:10:08] running from cave to cave for his life
[1:10:10] and he doesn't understand what's going
[1:10:12] on he doesn't know what god's doing in
[1:10:14] his life he doesn't know what the answer
[1:10:16] is what the solution is he he is
[1:10:18] perplexed
[1:10:22] let's look at this in
[1:10:24] in psalms 142
[1:10:26] verse 1
[1:10:27] i cried unto the lord with my voice with
[1:10:30] my voice and to the lord did i make my
[1:10:32] supplication i poured out my complaint
[1:10:34] before him i showed before him my
[1:10:36] trouble
[1:10:37] when my spirit was overwhelmed within me
[1:10:40] then thou knewest my path oh i loved
[1:10:43] that scripture
[1:10:44] when my spirit was overwhelmed within me
[1:10:47] then thou knewest my path
[1:10:52] in the way where and i walked
[1:10:54] have they privately laid a snare for me
[1:10:58] i looked on my right hand and behold but
[1:11:00] there was no man that would know me
[1:11:02] that would know me refuge failed me no
[1:11:04] man cared for my soul i cried unto the
[1:11:07] lord o lord i said thou art my refuge in
[1:11:09] my portion in the land of the living
[1:11:11] attendant to my cry for i am brought
[1:11:14] very low
[1:11:15] deliver me from my pers persecutors for
[1:11:18] they are stronger than i
[1:11:20] bring my soul out of prison that i may
[1:11:22] praise thy name thy righteous shall
[1:11:25] compass thy
[1:11:27] the righteous shall compass me about for
[1:11:29] thou shalt deal bountifully with me
[1:11:33] i love the way
[1:11:34] uh
[1:11:35] david writes so many psalms
[1:11:37] so many times david starts off in
[1:11:40] distress
[1:11:42] he starts off crying he starts off in
[1:11:44] distress and if you read through the
[1:11:46] psalms you'll find this pattern many
[1:11:48] times in the psalms that he'll he'll
[1:11:50] start off distressed he'll start off in
[1:11:52] trouble he'll start off weeping
[1:11:54] and then he'll make a declaration
[1:11:57] but god hears me
[1:12:00] and then he'll continue on with the
[1:12:02] weeping and the crying and the asking of
[1:12:04] her help but he'll conclude
[1:12:06] with god will save me
[1:12:10] oh friends how many times do we go
[1:12:12] through that same process in our life we
[1:12:15] start off with the weeping and the
[1:12:16] despair but we remember the promise but
[1:12:18] god you know who i am you called me you
[1:12:21] saved me you filled me with your spirit
[1:12:23] and now i'm in trouble and and i don't
[1:12:25] know what to do and i don't know the
[1:12:26] decisions to make and i don't know which
[1:12:28] way to go but i know
[1:12:32] that you'll carry me through
[1:12:34] i mean what are you doing you're praying
[1:12:35] just like david prayed
[1:12:37] amen we're coming back getting away from
[1:12:40] all the outside and coming back to the
[1:12:42] core truth that's laying there it's
[1:12:43] always been laying there that will never
[1:12:45] change the truth for david is david was
[1:12:47] chosen to be the anointed king of israel
[1:12:49] no matter what the circumstances was
[1:12:51] that truth remained
[1:12:53] no matter how much it looked like it
[1:12:55] wasn't happening and and then his life
[1:12:57] was in jeopardy his life was never in
[1:12:59] jeopardy
[1:13:01] because he was anointed to be king of
[1:13:02] israel when he was distressed and
[1:13:05] confused and maybe disappointed even
[1:13:08] possibly discouraged by the way he
[1:13:10] writes the psalms it looks like times
[1:13:11] he's discouraged and disappointed and
[1:13:14] confused amen but it never changed the
[1:13:16] underlying truth that he was the chosen
[1:13:20] amen anointed king of israel and god was
[1:13:23] going to bring him to that position
[1:13:29] we've been called
[1:13:31] anointed
[1:13:32] to be the bride in this end time
[1:13:36] no matter how many caves you dodge into
[1:13:38] to run for cover it won't change that
[1:13:42] no matter how many tears you shed over
[1:13:44] the circumstances in your life it will
[1:13:46] not change that
[1:13:48] no matter how many times you're confused
[1:13:50] about what god is doing in your life or
[1:13:53] how many times you're in distress
[1:13:54] because of your own nature or your own
[1:13:57] or whatever is going on around you no
[1:13:59] matter how much you run from cave to
[1:14:02] cave and crying to the lord it will not
[1:14:04] change that you have been anointed to be
[1:14:06] the bride of jesus christ in this day
[1:14:08] it will not change your position it will
[1:14:10] not change who you are and it will not
[1:14:11] change your destiny or the fact that god
[1:14:14] will do exactly what he purposed to do
[1:14:16] in your life
[1:14:18] can we keep from crying
[1:14:20] no
[1:14:22] can you keep the pressure off
[1:14:25] no
[1:14:27] can you change all your circumstances
[1:14:29] no
[1:14:31] if you could you would have a long time
[1:14:33] a long time ago
[1:14:35] you would have
[1:14:36] if you could remove all perplexity you
[1:14:37] would have already done it
[1:14:39] if you would have freed yourself from
[1:14:41] all stress you would have already done
[1:14:42] it
[1:14:43] if you could have solved all your
[1:14:44] problems if you could have solved all
[1:14:46] your problems and you didn't then you
[1:14:47] got a problem
[1:14:52] there's things that are kind of come
[1:14:54] that are coming that we can't do
[1:14:56] anything about
[1:14:59] there are there are things that will be
[1:15:01] confusing
[1:15:03] distressful
[1:15:05] all of the above
[1:15:07] but what can we do
[1:15:09] i'd say i do like david did cry unto the
[1:15:11] lord said lord you see me you see where
[1:15:12] i'm hurting you see what i'm struggling
[1:15:14] with but i know you haven't forgotten me
[1:15:17] but i know when that prophet looked out
[1:15:20] and said i'm going to call you bride so
[1:15:21] that you understand he was speaking to
[1:15:23] me that's my title that's who i am i've
[1:15:26] been anointed under the holy ghost that
[1:15:28] has come back unto the church today the
[1:15:30] word has washed me established me placed
[1:15:32] my foot on my feet on firm ground and
[1:15:35] gone i know that i'll come through this
[1:15:36] too i know that you'll change this and i
[1:15:38] know whatever happens that's not
[1:15:40] changing in your mind
[1:15:43] i think sometimes we just need to hear
[1:15:45] ourselves say it
[1:15:48] i think sometimes amen we
[1:15:51] we we get in situations and we just mull
[1:15:53] them over in our minds
[1:15:56] and and then the devil begins to have a
[1:15:58] playground
[1:16:00] in our thinking
[1:16:02] and we begin to mull them over and mull
[1:16:04] them over and roll them around and roll
[1:16:06] them around i'm guilty of doing this
[1:16:08] i'll do this for months on end
[1:16:11] but i think sometimes we just need to
[1:16:13] take it out of our mind and put it in
[1:16:14] our mouth
[1:16:16] and say god this is the situation but i
[1:16:18] know who i am i know who chose me and i
[1:16:22] know that you're going to fix this
[1:16:23] situation
[1:16:25] and i'm declaring my confidence in that
[1:16:27] today
[1:16:29] i think that'll bring more peace than
[1:16:31] mulling it over one more time
[1:16:33] then letting it go around the
[1:16:34] merry-go-round of the mind one more loop
[1:16:36] what is that going to accomplish nothing
[1:16:38] but we've got to come back to the word
[1:16:39] and say the word says this and i believe
[1:16:42] the word
[1:16:44] the word says i'm healed the word says
[1:16:46] i'm delivered the word says i'm his the
[1:16:47] word says i'm in his hand
[1:16:50] and he'll never lose me
[1:16:53] brother man goes on to say
[1:16:55] in a message from 1957
[1:16:58] titled god in his word and then i wonder
[1:17:00] sometimes i get so discouraged
[1:17:03] who's saying this the prophet of god
[1:17:06] the one who spoke squirrels into
[1:17:08] existence
[1:17:10] the one who started a healing revival
[1:17:12] that swept the world
[1:17:15] the one who prayed
[1:17:16] for multitudes of sick people and saw
[1:17:19] people with blind eyes open saw people
[1:17:22] with no eyeballs in their sockets eyes
[1:17:24] come back into their sockets and deaf
[1:17:26] ears he saw opened by by by faith in the
[1:17:29] word of god in his prayer amen stood
[1:17:32] before uh multitudes of people and cast
[1:17:34] out demons night after night after night
[1:17:37] saw ministries rise up all around him
[1:17:40] that that proclaimed that it was his
[1:17:42] gift and his moving forward that
[1:17:44] encouraged them to step forward you know
[1:17:45] in oral roberts and tommy hicks and
[1:17:47] tommy osborne and all these healing
[1:17:49] campaigns this is the one you would
[1:17:52] think how could you be discouraged
[1:17:56] but it's the paradox of the christian
[1:17:57] life
[1:17:59] the one that was the most used we
[1:18:01] i mean tell me where in history where
[1:18:04] anywhere have you ever seen a ministry a
[1:18:06] man used at the level that god used this
[1:18:08] vessel
[1:18:10] show it to me where have you seen it
[1:18:12] whether it was used amen to this level
[1:18:15] with this much manifestation
[1:18:19] and yet he was discouraged
[1:18:23] i don't feel so guilty for feeling
[1:18:24] discouraged
[1:18:27] then i wonder sometimes i get so
[1:18:29] discouraged
[1:18:31] it's a wonder my wife can put up with me
[1:18:34] i go around after the meeting i feel so
[1:18:37] moody
[1:18:38] i cry a while i walk around a while and
[1:18:41] i say oh i'm a total failure
[1:18:44] i don't see why the lord ever had
[1:18:46] anything to do with me
[1:18:48] it's coming out from under that
[1:18:50] anointing you see
[1:18:52] that's when you're up there you feel
[1:18:53] like you could pack the world away
[1:18:56] and when you're down here it's all right
[1:18:57] but it's coming between the two that's
[1:18:59] where it gets you
[1:19:01] like elijah was up on the mountain why
[1:19:03] he called fire out of heaven then he
[1:19:05] called rain out of the heavens after it
[1:19:07] hadn't rained for three years what
[1:19:08] anointing called up 400 balaam priests
[1:19:12] and chopped their heads off what a
[1:19:13] powerful anointing then went down into
[1:19:15] the desert and the threat of a woman run
[1:19:17] him out into the desert and when the
[1:19:19] anointing left him he was 40 days
[1:19:20] wandering out there in the wilderness
[1:19:22] and god found him pulled back in a cave
[1:19:24] that's right no need to try to explain
[1:19:26] it you can't
[1:19:28] you see in the bible elijah on the
[1:19:30] mountaintop he was invincible friends
[1:19:34] unstoppable amen had a tremendous
[1:19:37] victory and then one woman threatened
[1:19:39] his life and he runs scared into the
[1:19:40] wilderness
[1:19:42] let's just look at what he says in first
[1:19:44] kings i'd like to just read
[1:19:46] what he says here
[1:19:54] first kings 19 and 2.
[1:20:04] and it's not so much
[1:20:06] what he says that i want to look at
[1:20:09] but i want to look at god's response
[1:20:13] 19 and 2 then jezebel sent a messenger
[1:20:16] into elijah saying
[1:20:18] so let the gods do to me and more also
[1:20:20] if i make not thy life as the life of
[1:20:22] one of them by tomorrow about this time
[1:20:26] and when he saw that he arose and went
[1:20:28] for his life and came to beersheba which
[1:20:30] belonged to judah and left his servant
[1:20:32] there but he himself went a day's
[1:20:34] journey into the wilderness and came and
[1:20:36] sat down under a juniper tree
[1:20:38] and he requested for himself that he
[1:20:40] might die
[1:20:44] i say he was discouraged
[1:20:47] depressed possibly
[1:20:50] he requested that he might die
[1:20:52] he had just had a tremendous victory
[1:20:54] that would turn the hearts of god's
[1:20:55] children back to god
[1:20:58] he had just had supernatural events take
[1:21:01] place
[1:21:02] by obeying the word of god fire from
[1:21:05] heaven come down
[1:21:07] and he runs into the wilderness and he
[1:21:08] asks god to let him die
[1:21:12] he requested for himself that he might
[1:21:14] die and said it is enough now o lord
[1:21:16] take away my life for i am not better
[1:21:18] than my father's
[1:21:20] and as he lay and slept under a juniper
[1:21:22] tree behold then an angel touched him
[1:21:24] and said unto him
[1:21:26] arise and eat and he looked and behold
[1:21:29] there was a cake bacon on the coals and
[1:21:31] a cruise of water at his head and he did
[1:21:33] eat and drink and laid him down again
[1:21:38] here
[1:21:39] comes the
[1:21:41] paradox of elijah
[1:21:44] standing
[1:21:45] on mount carmel
[1:21:47] the mighty prophet of god
[1:21:50] invincible
[1:21:51] with the word of god that cannot be
[1:21:53] defeated
[1:21:54] calling a challenge to the false
[1:21:57] religion and the false priests they take
[1:21:59] him up on the challenge he knows where
[1:22:01] he stands he knows who he is god is
[1:22:04] working in him and showed him what to do
[1:22:06] nothing can stop him amen and they gives
[1:22:09] them their chance to to prove that their
[1:22:11] god is real and he begins to he's so
[1:22:13] confident in himself he begins to mock
[1:22:15] them
[1:22:17] maybe your god is on a uh per adventure
[1:22:21] he's he's traveling and he's far away
[1:22:23] and he starts to mock them he's so
[1:22:26] confident
[1:22:29] and then when the time comes he
[1:22:31] he's so sure that god answered by fire
[1:22:33] he comes and he bathes the sacrifice and
[1:22:36] the altar in the wood and water and and
[1:22:38] it comes and flows over till it fills
[1:22:40] the trenches and and then he he calls
[1:22:42] out to god and said god i have done this
[1:22:44] at thy command
[1:22:46] and fire from heaven comes down and
[1:22:49] consumes the sacrifice and the wood and
[1:22:51] the stones and the water and all before
[1:22:53] the eyes of israel amen he was
[1:22:55] vindicated he was proved
[1:22:56] everything was as god would say a mighty
[1:22:59] miracle that nobody can deny amen then
[1:23:01] they take the false prophets 400 false
[1:23:04] prophets of baal and they slay them to
[1:23:06] free israel from the rain what a victory
[1:23:11] and the next day he runs for his life
[1:23:14] he's discouraged and depressed he crimes
[1:23:17] under
[1:23:18] he wants to be by himself that's always
[1:23:20] a sure sign
[1:23:22] he doesn't want anybody around he leaves
[1:23:24] a certain he goes off by himself climbs
[1:23:26] under a juniper tree and says lord i
[1:23:29] want to die
[1:23:32] have you ever been under so much stress
[1:23:33] and i'm distressed that you just wanted
[1:23:35] to leave this world
[1:23:38] i have
[1:23:39] especially after brother brown tells us
[1:23:40] about the sixth dimension i mean it
[1:23:42] doesn't take very much to get me to want
[1:23:44] to go
[1:23:46] if i have to wait in line at the store
[1:23:48] i'm like just take me to the sixth
[1:23:49] dimension
[1:23:51] it doesn't take very many trials anymore
[1:23:56] but here elijah
[1:23:58] take my life
[1:24:00] what good is it me for me i let me die
[1:24:03] i'm no better than my father's
[1:24:06] what does god do
[1:24:07] god is not disrupted by a psyche
[1:24:11] because god knows who he is
[1:24:13] he knows what's in him and god doesn't
[1:24:15] cast him away
[1:24:16] because he's having a meltdown
[1:24:19] god doesn't discard him because he's
[1:24:21] lost his vision god doesn't cast him
[1:24:23] away because now he's depressed and he
[1:24:25] wants to die and he's lost his vision
[1:24:28] his purpose to serve god he just wants
[1:24:30] to leave this planet he just wants to be
[1:24:32] free from all the pressure amen and god
[1:24:34] doesn't discard him but brother brahma
[1:24:36] said he sent the angel with the softest
[1:24:39] hands
[1:24:42] he didn't kick him
[1:24:46] god's not afraid of your psyche
[1:24:50] it doesn't change anything
[1:24:52] god's put something in you to overcome
[1:24:54] that psyche
[1:24:56] and god sent a word in this day to
[1:24:57] explain everything to us so that we
[1:24:59] don't have to cater to that we don't
[1:25:01] have to give in to it we don't have to
[1:25:02] be afraid of it amen we don't have to
[1:25:04] pay attention but we can come back to
[1:25:06] the inner man and stand upon the word
[1:25:08] and believe god till all of this sorts
[1:25:10] itself out and god brings it back in
[1:25:12] line to the word we don't have to fear
[1:25:14] it we don't have to fight it we don't
[1:25:16] have we can just ignore it and say god
[1:25:18] will take care of that i'm focusing on
[1:25:20] my purpose in this life i'm focusing on
[1:25:22] what god called me to do
[1:25:25] but god wasn't afraid
[1:25:28] of elijah's psyche
[1:25:30] he wasn't afraid of his discouragement
[1:25:33] he wasn't afraid
[1:25:35] so he sends the angel with the softest
[1:25:37] hands
[1:25:40] and he
[1:25:41] baked a meal for him because he was a
[1:25:44] tired servant
[1:25:46] he had overworked and he got too tired
[1:25:49] and god knew
[1:25:51] and he sent the angel with the softest
[1:25:52] hands just to stroke his cheek to wake
[1:25:55] him up
[1:25:56] not to startle him because he's stressed
[1:26:00] not to shake him awake because he's he's
[1:26:03] in a fragile state of mind
[1:26:06] you think god doesn't understand who we
[1:26:08] are
[1:26:09] you think god doesn't understand what we
[1:26:11] go through
[1:26:13] send the angels with the softest hands
[1:26:14] to stroke his cheek awake
[1:26:16] and when he opened his eyes he saw
[1:26:19] coals and on the fire
[1:26:21] bake the bread
[1:26:23] and he ate and he went back to sleep
[1:26:26] god knew what he needed was just a
[1:26:28] little bit of rest
[1:26:29] not kicked around not told how worthless
[1:26:32] he was
[1:26:33] not corrected for how can you say let me
[1:26:36] die why would you say a thing like that
[1:26:38] god's the one who determines your life
[1:26:40] and determines your death
[1:26:46] god realized he was an overworked tired
[1:26:48] servant
[1:26:50] who was a little bit neurotic because he
[1:26:51] needed to be that way for his purpose in
[1:26:54] life
[1:26:56] brother ben said i've been a neurotic
[1:26:58] all my life but i needed to be that way
[1:27:00] you think god didn't understand the
[1:27:02] prophet of god you think god doesn't
[1:27:04] understand you
[1:27:07] sent the angel with the softest hands
[1:27:10] put him back to sleep
[1:27:12] stroked him one more time
[1:27:14] and gave him
[1:27:16] enough energy enough strength
[1:27:18] enough rest that he could go 40 days on
[1:27:21] that bread and he went he went to mount
[1:27:23] sinai and he went to uh to the mountain
[1:27:26] and went to a cave in the mountain and
[1:27:28] god would come and god wouldn't yell at
[1:27:30] him but god would show his power and his
[1:27:32] might and then he would whisper a still
[1:27:34] small voice and what did he do to elijah
[1:27:36] he put elijah back in his commission
[1:27:39] what doest thou hear elijah he said well
[1:27:42] i've done this and that and they've
[1:27:44] chased my life and they've all forsaken
[1:27:45] me
[1:27:46] he listens to him wine
[1:27:50] but he says again what doest i'll hear
[1:27:52] elijah
[1:27:54] and he goes through it all again and god
[1:27:56] doesn't even deal with it he says
[1:27:58] go anoint jehu king
[1:28:01] of israel go anoint hezekiah king of
[1:28:03] syria go anoint elisha prophet and thy
[1:28:05] stead
[1:28:07] what is it you've got a work to do it's
[1:28:09] time to keep working i give you rest i
[1:28:11] give you food i listen to your whining
[1:28:16] but i've got something for you to do
[1:28:22] brother bam says in the uniting time and
[1:28:24] sign
[1:28:25] said one of my main things that i always
[1:28:27] hurt me through my life has been a
[1:28:29] nervous condition
[1:28:31] that when i get so worn then i get real
[1:28:34] weary
[1:28:35] how is it that we can understand elijah
[1:28:37] under the juniper tree so well because
[1:28:39] we've seen elijah in our day
[1:28:41] had to have that same nature that that
[1:28:44] same way so that he could be dealt with
[1:28:47] by god
[1:28:48] then when i get so warned then i get
[1:28:50] real weary
[1:28:51] kind of feel like nobody cares for you
[1:28:53] you know
[1:28:55] you have it too
[1:28:58] has anybody ever felt like nobody cares
[1:29:00] for you
[1:29:02] yes sir
[1:29:05] and just
[1:29:06] i happen to have a real overdose of it
[1:29:08] you know and it gets real bad sometime
[1:29:11] and i can hardly it's tension that's
[1:29:14] what does it
[1:29:16] and i get to a spot then that many times
[1:29:17] especially with so many of those visions
[1:29:19] you see it just gets me i look at a
[1:29:21] person i think this is a vision no no no
[1:29:23] it isn't yes it's no it's not
[1:29:25] you see and you just don't realize what
[1:29:27] a price goes with that so then you
[1:29:29] wonder then you get to thinking well
[1:29:31] then you get off your side and you say
[1:29:33] well now what have i what have i done
[1:29:36] here am i i'm 50 years old and i've done
[1:29:39] nothing for the lord and i'm getting old
[1:29:40] and what's oh my then you just get what
[1:29:43] we used to call the blues
[1:29:45] some of you brethren about my age
[1:29:47] remember what they used to call have the
[1:29:49] blues pop used to talk about it and i
[1:29:51] wondered what he meant and i sure now
[1:29:53] know what he meant
[1:29:55] so then you get to feeling that way
[1:29:59] which is none of it true
[1:30:02] it's just you
[1:30:05] you know it see you know it it's just
[1:30:08] you doing that
[1:30:11] it was his own cockabur nature doing
[1:30:14] that
[1:30:15] it was just you
[1:30:17] and i don't know about you but aren't
[1:30:19] you thankful he said that on tape
[1:30:23] aren't you thankful that he told you
[1:30:26] what real christianity was like not the
[1:30:28] fairy tale the reality
[1:30:35] none of it's true
[1:30:37] it's not true
[1:30:38] you just could feel that way and the
[1:30:40] feeling feels true but the feeling's
[1:30:42] never true
[1:30:44] so that's why we ignore the feeling you
[1:30:46] can't just change the feeling you say
[1:30:48] well i feel i feel really perplexed i
[1:30:50] feel really anxious i'm not going to
[1:30:51] feel anxious anymore good luck
[1:30:55] it's a real feeling it's in the cockpit
[1:30:56] nature you're not going to be able to
[1:30:58] change that but turn our attention from
[1:31:00] it and turn our attention back to what
[1:31:01] we know is true because we know that's
[1:31:04] not true
[1:31:05] that's temporal that'll change it was
[1:31:08] something different before that feeling
[1:31:09] came it'll be something different after
[1:31:11] that feeling leaves don't be afraid of
[1:31:13] it don't fixate on it don't identify
[1:31:15] with it come back to the things that we
[1:31:17] know are true and focus our attention on
[1:31:20] the things that we know to be true
[1:31:26] i want to just i want to read a couple
[1:31:27] spots and just show you that god
[1:31:29] understood his prophet
[1:31:32] he understood the nature that he would
[1:31:33] have
[1:31:35] he understood the benefits and he also
[1:31:37] understood the negatives
[1:31:40] he said
[1:31:43] in 1960 brother branham is talking
[1:31:46] about going beyond the curtain of time
[1:31:48] and he says i and i looked and i heard
[1:31:51] something kept saying you're just
[1:31:52] starting press the battle just keep
[1:31:54] pressing
[1:31:55] i shook my head a minute and then i
[1:31:57] thought well i probably just think
[1:31:59] just thinking like this you know and a
[1:32:01] person can get some imaginations and i
[1:32:03] said i just probably imagined that
[1:32:05] it said press the battle keep going keep
[1:32:08] going
[1:32:09] and i said maybe i said that i put my
[1:32:11] lips within my teeth and i put my hand
[1:32:13] over my mouth and there it come again
[1:32:14] said just keep pressing if you only knew
[1:32:16] what was at the end of the road and it
[1:32:19] seemed like i could hear graham snelling
[1:32:20] or somebody that sing that song like
[1:32:22] this that sings it here anna may and all
[1:32:24] of you all i am homesick and blue i want
[1:32:27] to see jesus
[1:32:28] i'd like to hear those sweet harbor
[1:32:30] bells chime it would be brighten my path
[1:32:32] and would vanish all fears lord let me
[1:32:34] look past the curtain of time
[1:32:36] you've heard it saying here at the
[1:32:38] church
[1:32:39] and i heard something say would you like
[1:32:41] to see just beyond the curtain
[1:32:44] i said it would help me so much
[1:32:48] brother man was laying there wondering
[1:32:50] about his ministry feeling like he
[1:32:52] hadn't accomplished anything for the
[1:32:53] lord he hadn't been a real success and
[1:32:56] god begins to come to him and he said
[1:32:58] would you like to see past the current
[1:33:00] time and the prophet said it would help
[1:33:01] me so much
[1:33:04] and i looked and just in a moment one
[1:33:06] breath i'd come into a little place that
[1:33:08] slanted i looked back and there was
[1:33:10] laying on the bed and i said this is a
[1:33:12] strange thing and god took him beyond
[1:33:14] the curtain of time and probably said it
[1:33:16] would help me so much
[1:33:19] but
[1:33:20] no matter how much help that was
[1:33:23] his tension came back again
[1:33:26] he began to have the same questions
[1:33:28] again and the same concerns again
[1:33:32] and then we find him in standing in the
[1:33:34] gap and we know the circumstances around
[1:33:36] standing in the gap he had come he had
[1:33:38] preached the seals it wasn't accepted
[1:33:40] and he began to build up a complex
[1:33:42] because people hadn't received his
[1:33:43] message and he wanted to run away and
[1:33:45] hide from the people and and he had a
[1:33:47] plan worked out and god was going to
[1:33:49] correct him
[1:33:51] but god wasn't just going to correct him
[1:33:53] because god also understood him god was
[1:33:55] going to do something wonderful for this
[1:33:56] prophet
[1:33:58] and he begins to explain it he you know
[1:34:01] he's driving along and he has that dream
[1:34:03] of him being a bum and then he sees
[1:34:05] those bums in the cafe and
[1:34:07] and then he's driving along again and
[1:34:08] god says if you go on with your plans
[1:34:10] that'll be you
[1:34:12] your wife won't stay up there and then
[1:34:14] and god corrects him and he recognizes
[1:34:16] he's wrong and is thinking he's wrong
[1:34:18] and he's just weary he's just tense he's
[1:34:20] just feeling rejected and he's he's
[1:34:23] upset
[1:34:24] he's built himself he said i built
[1:34:26] myself a complex who built the complex
[1:34:28] he did
[1:34:33] but then all of a sudden god tells him
[1:34:34] to pull over the car
[1:34:37] he pulls over the car
[1:34:40] and he says look there and he looks and
[1:34:42] he sees a mountain range
[1:34:44] the last mountain range before you go
[1:34:46] into another mountain range and there
[1:34:47] were seven peaks
[1:34:49] it says and there was three outstanding
[1:34:51] peaks
[1:34:52] those three peaks are the first second
[1:34:54] and third pool the first one was your
[1:34:56] first part of your ministry this is god
[1:34:58] speaking to him small hill then your
[1:35:00] first poll pretty high you know the sign
[1:35:02] in the hand and there was a little
[1:35:03] interval in there and that time that i
[1:35:05] was taken off he's explaining this
[1:35:07] mountain range as it goes up and down
[1:35:11] he said
[1:35:13] there was that little interval in there
[1:35:15] the time that i was taken off from being
[1:35:17] too tired
[1:35:19] that's when he was nervous had a nervous
[1:35:21] breakdown had to leave the field
[1:35:24] did god understand
[1:35:26] he wrote it in the mountain when he
[1:35:28] formed the earth
[1:35:30] did god know about his nervous tension
[1:35:32] and the trouble of the costume god
[1:35:34] already put the interval between the
[1:35:36] first and second pool
[1:35:37] god had laid a valley
[1:35:40] whenever he formed that mountain range
[1:35:42] and he formed it building up the
[1:35:44] ministry coming to the first pour he he
[1:35:47] when god the great artist of all
[1:35:49] creation when he dropped in a little
[1:35:50] valley here he knew it'd be a low point
[1:35:52] in his prophet's life
[1:35:58] he said then taken from that when i was
[1:36:00] taken off the field from being too tired
[1:36:01] many of you remember it and then come to
[1:36:03] discernment the second pool now i've had
[1:36:05] another about a few years here of just
[1:36:07] kind of little peaksy back like my
[1:36:09] ministry wasn't yet and then come the
[1:36:11] third one three is a number of
[1:36:13] completion see the third one the next
[1:36:15] peak was five number of grace and the
[1:36:17] next peak was seven the number
[1:36:18] perfection the end six days shall you
[1:36:21] labor the seventh the sabbath the end of
[1:36:23] the week the end of time see and i
[1:36:25] stopped and i showed it to billy
[1:36:30] and i looked at them he said
[1:36:32] that let that stand billy tells him let
[1:36:34] that stand if there's ever a doubt in
[1:36:36] your mind remember this place and come
[1:36:39] back here
[1:36:41] was ever a doubt in your mind remember
[1:36:43] this place and come back here
[1:36:46] god
[1:36:47] knew what nature that prophet would have
[1:36:49] and it had to be a certain nature like
[1:36:51] elijah amen it had to match and he had
[1:36:54] to use it to do the work that god called
[1:36:56] him to do but don't think god didn't
[1:36:58] understand and even when the prophet was
[1:37:01] having his trouble amen feeling rejected
[1:37:03] and building up a complex and wanting to
[1:37:05] leave the grind of the ministry and get
[1:37:07] away from the people amen god already
[1:37:10] knew god had already whenever he formed
[1:37:12] that mountain range he already wrote his
[1:37:14] whole life he said there's seven peaks
[1:37:16] and god said what's your name
[1:37:19] seven letters williams seven marion
[1:37:22] seven branham seven seven peaks your
[1:37:24] name is written in that mountain your
[1:37:26] life is in that mountain your ministry
[1:37:28] is in that mountain the high parts and
[1:37:30] the low parts were already foreseen by
[1:37:33] god and put in the mountain
[1:37:36] if god can do that for that man can he
[1:37:38] do it for you friends does he know your
[1:37:40] high spots and your low spots can it all
[1:37:43] work together for the program of god can
[1:37:45] we just let god be god amen and let him
[1:37:48] be in control and quit trying to figure
[1:37:50] everything out and say the high parts
[1:37:52] were god the low parts he knew about
[1:37:56] he wrote it he knew the interval he knew
[1:37:59] the spacing he knew the distance between
[1:38:01] the second and third pull and he knew
[1:38:02] the third pull would fade out into
[1:38:05] eternity
[1:38:08] what was that
[1:38:10] that was the tender hand of jehovah
[1:38:13] to take his prophet and say
[1:38:15] i know all about it son
[1:38:18] i know what you're thinking
[1:38:19] brother brahm hadn't said any of his
[1:38:21] plans
[1:38:23] about hurting and feeling rejected
[1:38:25] brother branham didn't just come up with
[1:38:27] a plan and say you know i'm going to
[1:38:29] stomp off i'm leaving the field i'm
[1:38:30] stomping up the to
[1:38:32] alaska i'll stomp out when i get a mess
[1:38:35] where did that come from that came from
[1:38:36] hurt he was wounded
[1:38:38] he was rejected and had a complex and
[1:38:40] wanted to get away from the pain amen
[1:38:43] and god knew it god timed it god had the
[1:38:47] mountain range in a certain spot and had
[1:38:49] the prophet driving at a certain time
[1:38:51] and knew what he would be thinking about
[1:38:54] on that road as he came near that
[1:38:56] mountain range
[1:38:58] and he knew when to stop the car
[1:39:01] he knew
[1:39:03] where it was
[1:39:04] he ordained it before the foundation of
[1:39:06] the world
[1:39:07] to encourage his prophet and to let him
[1:39:09] know
[1:39:10] i know all about it
[1:39:12] don't think that way you go that way
[1:39:14] you're thinking you're going to have
[1:39:16] trouble
[1:39:17] god loved him enough to stop him
[1:39:20] but not just to correct him god loved
[1:39:22] him enough
[1:39:23] that there was a savior with gentle
[1:39:25] hands
[1:39:26] that would say stop the car i want to
[1:39:27] show you something
[1:39:29] i've corrected you let me now encourage
[1:39:31] you
[1:39:33] it's all been for ordained
[1:39:35] i've known it all
[1:39:38] i know
[1:39:39] the nature you have and i know how you
[1:39:41] suffered with it
[1:39:42] but i know what i intended to do with it
[1:39:45] i know how much trouble amen the
[1:39:48] position you're in and how much stress
[1:39:50] it causes i know much trouble you're in
[1:39:52] i know i know how uh
[1:39:54] anxious you've become and i know how
[1:39:56] hurt you are amen but you can't go on
[1:39:59] with your plans that's wrong
[1:40:02] but look son
[1:40:04] i know
[1:40:06] i tell you friends
[1:40:08] god knows
[1:40:12] god knows
[1:40:13] what part of his your nature
[1:40:16] is serving his purpose and he knows what
[1:40:17] part of your nature is hurting you
[1:40:20] he knows about the circumstances our
[1:40:23] life he knows about the mind battles he
[1:40:25] knows about the the the fiery darts of
[1:40:28] the enemy that enter our mind he knows
[1:40:30] about the questions and he knows about
[1:40:32] the discouragement and he knows about
[1:40:34] all of these things
[1:40:38] he didn't just know for the prophet he
[1:40:40] knows for all of his children
[1:40:43] he knows where your high spots were and
[1:40:45] he knows where your low spots were he
[1:40:46] knows where your high spots will be and
[1:40:48] where your low spots will be god knows
[1:40:50] where it's at and god is not here to
[1:40:53] kick and he's not here he'll correct
[1:40:56] but he'll correct and show you no you
[1:40:58] can't go that way
[1:41:00] here's my plan for you
[1:41:02] and look
[1:41:03] i already know
[1:41:06] was it right for elijah to say take my
[1:41:08] life
[1:41:09] no
[1:41:10] but god knew where he was at
[1:41:13] god sent him back into action was it
[1:41:15] right for brother branham of his own
[1:41:16] choice to want to leave the ministry and
[1:41:18] deceive his wife no god corrected him
[1:41:20] but god knew where he was at
[1:41:23] and i say
[1:41:24] above all
[1:41:26] the comfort to my heart is god knows
[1:41:30] that this life we live as the bride of
[1:41:32] jesus christ is a paradox friend
[1:41:35] an absolute paradox that you have been
[1:41:38] called amen before the foundation of the
[1:41:40] world to manifest the very life of jesus
[1:41:43] christ in flesh
[1:41:46] but be but that flash that he's coming
[1:41:48] through is a flesh that has a sticky
[1:41:50] cultivar nature that's still remaining
[1:41:52] and gives you problems sometimes
[1:41:55] you've called amen to to move into the
[1:41:58] capstone of this great new testament to
[1:42:00] be all that the new testament is called
[1:42:02] to be you're called to be that and in
[1:42:04] the midst of that you can feel
[1:42:06] discouraged
[1:42:08] and in the midst of that you can feel
[1:42:10] stressed and strained and you can feel
[1:42:12] all of these things that the prophet
[1:42:14] felt that paul felt that they came under
[1:42:16] amen
[1:42:17] it is the paradox of being the bride of
[1:42:20] jesus christ in the end time
[1:42:22] not the fairy tale the reality
[1:42:26] but i tell you friends
[1:42:28] he's already written it in his mountain
[1:42:31] it's already in stone amen it's it's
[1:42:33] already in the book god already knows it
[1:42:36] was in his mind before the foundation of
[1:42:38] the world none of these things move him
[1:42:40] he's got a plan and he's working his
[1:42:42] plan and you've got a certain thing that
[1:42:44] you just have to ting in this life and
[1:42:46] so just let god get the ting out of your
[1:42:49] life
[1:42:51] and don't worry about the rest he knows
[1:42:53] about it
[1:42:54] focus on the inner man focus on the word
[1:42:59] and you'll see
[1:43:00] victory after victory after victory
[1:43:05] let's turn to psalms 40. i want to read
[1:43:07] two portions of scripture as we close
[1:43:21] psalms chapter 40.
[1:43:34] psalms 40 verse 1
[1:43:37] i waited patiently for the lord and he
[1:43:39] inclined unto me and heard my cry
[1:43:42] he brought me up also out of a horrible
[1:43:44] pit and out of a mirey clay and set my
[1:43:46] feet upon a rock and established my
[1:43:48] goings
[1:43:49] and he hath put a new song in my mouth
[1:43:51] even praise unto our god many shall see
[1:43:54] it in fear and shall trust in the lord
[1:43:56] blessed is that man that maketh the lord
[1:43:58] his trust and respect is not the proud
[1:44:01] nor such as turn aside to lies
[1:44:05] many o lord my god
[1:44:07] are thy wonderful works which thou has
[1:44:09] done and thy thoughts which are to us
[1:44:11] word they cannot be reckoned up in order
[1:44:14] unto thee
[1:44:15] if i would declare and speak of them
[1:44:17] they are more than can be numbered
[1:44:21] does god love you
[1:44:23] oh yes he does
[1:44:25] does god know
[1:44:26] oh yes he does
[1:44:29] and your psyche is not your soul
[1:44:33] we don't have to succumb
[1:44:35] to the psyche
[1:44:36] we live by faith in the soul
[1:44:41] it's it's a paradox
[1:44:43] that you can be absolutely miserable in
[1:44:46] your mind
[1:44:48] and still have the joy of the lord in
[1:44:50] your heart
[1:44:52] you can be absolutely in your mind so
[1:44:55] uncertain of what's going to happen but
[1:44:56] so confident that god's got it worked
[1:44:58] out
[1:45:00] we are called to be a paradox in this
[1:45:02] world
[1:45:03] every born-again child of god is a
[1:45:06] paradox in this world
[1:45:08] you suffer through the same things the
[1:45:09] world suffers through but not the same
[1:45:11] way they suffer through it
[1:45:13] for you and i there's an anchor that
[1:45:15] holds there's a foundation within
[1:45:17] there's a truth that never fades away
[1:45:19] and our psyche is not our soul but the
[1:45:22] faith and the soul will overcome every
[1:45:24] day over and over day by day month by
[1:45:27] month year by year things will come
[1:45:29] they'll be overcome by faith things will
[1:45:31] come they'll be overcome by faith not
[1:45:33] something else will come it'll overcome
[1:45:35] by faith
[1:45:37] let's focus to the inner man
[1:45:40] and watch what god will do
[1:45:42] i want to read one more scripture as we
[1:45:44] close second corinthians chapter 4.
[1:45:52] ii corinthians chapter 4
[1:45:55] and verse 16.
[1:46:08] for which cause we faint not but though
[1:46:11] our outward man perish
[1:46:13] yet the inward man is renewed day by day
[1:46:16] for our light affliction which is but
[1:46:18] for a moment worketh for us a far more
[1:46:20] exceeding and eternal weight of glory
[1:46:22] while we look not at the things which
[1:46:24] are seen but of the things which are not
[1:46:26] seen for the things which are seen are
[1:46:29] temporal but the things which are not
[1:46:31] seen
[1:46:32] are eternal
[1:46:34] thank god for a revelation of eternal
[1:46:37] things
[1:46:39] and the eternal things in our life will
[1:46:41] always conquer and overcome the temporal
[1:46:44] things
[1:46:46] and the outer man
[1:46:48] let's all stand
[1:46:49] let's go to the lord
[1:46:51] the musicians and whether john will come
[1:46:54] this time
[1:46:56] let's just bow our heads and pray
[1:47:00] dear lord jesus
[1:47:03] oh god how we thank you that you're a
[1:47:05] heavenly father
[1:47:07] a loving father lord you know us like
[1:47:10] like you know us better than we know
[1:47:12] ourselves
[1:47:14] god when we see lord
[1:47:16] all your great men in the bible
[1:47:20] and how lord you watched over them and
[1:47:22] took care of them
[1:47:24] through their ups and through their
[1:47:25] downs the good times the bad times
[1:47:29] through the successes and through the
[1:47:30] failures lord you watched after them and
[1:47:32] you took care of them and you delivered
[1:47:34] them time after time after time
[1:47:37] and god we don't believe it was written
[1:47:39] there for their sakes alone but all of
[1:47:41] it was written for our sake lord
[1:47:43] that we'd have confidence in the day
[1:47:44] that we live in
[1:47:46] god i'm so thankful i'm so thankful to
[1:47:49] know that this old cockleburn nature is
[1:47:52] not me
[1:47:53] i'm so thankful for the revelation that
[1:47:55] the faith on the inside is who i really
[1:47:58] am
[1:47:59] and i don't have to give in to the
[1:48:01] thoughts and
[1:48:02] desires and lusts and confusions and
[1:48:04] stresses of the outer man the lord i can
[1:48:07] just keep going day by day in the
[1:48:09] renewal of my spirit in the inner man
[1:48:12] god let your word lord be our portion
[1:48:14] let your word be our life lord fill us
[1:48:17] with your spirit and help us lord by
[1:48:19] your grace to overcome all the obstacles
[1:48:21] that are around us
[1:48:23] god forgive us lord for our distresses
[1:48:26] forgive us for our complainings lord but
[1:48:28] i know you understand us
[1:48:30] you hear our cry your ear is bent
[1:48:32] towards our cry and you're ready to
[1:48:34] deliver
[1:48:36] and god when you knew the struggles of
[1:48:38] the prophet
[1:48:40] when you knew before he come on this
[1:48:43] life when you were forming the earth
[1:48:45] and out west lord you made a mountain
[1:48:47] range that would match his life so
[1:48:49] perfectly you knew he would have a
[1:48:52] valley
[1:48:53] you knew he would be low you knew he
[1:48:55] would come to distress and
[1:48:56] discouragement you knew he would have a
[1:48:58] complex and he would need to be freed
[1:49:01] from
[1:49:02] and god you're so tender and so loving
[1:49:05] that you laid a monument
[1:49:08] of a scale that no man could do to prove
[1:49:11] how much you love us and how much you
[1:49:13] know our life
[1:49:15] for our life is ordained and it's in
[1:49:17] your hands
[1:49:19] god i pray that this confidence would go
[1:49:21] deep into our hearts
[1:49:23] that we would no longer be afraid
[1:49:26] of the mental battles and struggles
[1:49:28] of the temptations of the of the
[1:49:31] questions of the uh the stresses and the
[1:49:33] anxieties lord help us not to fixate on
[1:49:36] those things help us not to be afraid of
[1:49:38] them lord
[1:49:40] let us know that that's just part of
[1:49:42] that old cocker burn nature
[1:49:45] but there's a wheat germ there's a real
[1:49:47] life a seed on the inside that's been
[1:49:49] quick in the life
[1:49:51] that's my overcoming portion that's my
[1:49:53] real life
[1:49:55] that is the pot that is the part that
[1:49:57] will change the rest
[1:49:59] you know and i pray that you'd bring us
[1:50:01] under your control
[1:50:03] under the control of your spirit you'd
[1:50:05] have preeminence that day by day you
[1:50:07] would have victory
[1:50:09] then you would take this vessel lord
[1:50:10] each one of us
[1:50:12] that you watched over to get us
[1:50:14] fashioned in a certain way
[1:50:16] to have a certain ring to our life that
[1:50:18] you can use
[1:50:20] god help us to surrender to your hand
[1:50:22] and let you have that ring let you have
[1:50:24] that pleasure of ringing that bell the
[1:50:27] way you want lord
[1:50:29] maybe not complain
[1:50:31] maybe not lord
[1:50:33] grumble
[1:50:34] but maybe just have faith in what you're
[1:50:36] doing
[1:50:37] and trust you to do it your way
[1:50:40] and at the end of this journey lord when
[1:50:41] it's all over
[1:50:43] you're gonna change this outer man
[1:50:45] anyhow so what does it matter
[1:50:47] you'll change our our psyche you'll
[1:50:50] change our flesh we'll never deal with
[1:50:53] those thoughts again we'll never deal
[1:50:55] with those stresses again we'll never
[1:50:57] deal with that discouragement again oh
[1:51:00] god help us to forget it now and just
[1:51:02] move on and trust you lord because you
[1:51:04] surely have a plan to change it all
[1:51:06] anyways
[1:51:07] it is not who we are
[1:51:09] but who we are is who you've made us
[1:51:11] lord who you've called us to be and who
[1:51:13] you've quickened us to be
[1:51:15] that's who we identify with lord
