TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so we know that what trans what does the transforming work it's the spirit of god where is the transforming power what is the transforming power of the word of god because the words i speak unto you they are spirit and life so when brother branham begins to talk about this transforming power amen he sometimes says the transforming power is the spirit sometimes he says the transforming power is the word he never separates the spirit from the word so it's not like somebody had transforming power transform their life with no word involved so the spirit of god that comes to give us a new birth and transform us it is not coming independently of the word it's receiving the word when you receive the word the spirit of the word comes into you and transforms you what happened to paul it says he heard a message and it transformed him from a church member and a church go to a prophet of god see if we want to be transformed in this hour if we want the the new birth if we want to transforming from the spirit of god we must receive the word that god has given us for this hour because this word will transform us so that's why we cannot preach a transforming experience separate from the word of god for this hour if we want to bring people to a transforming experience we must bring them the word and then you must take that word into your heart receive christ receive the word become one with it and the transforming power of the spirit will transform you that's the message so brother branham does not separate the two when he's describing the transformation what does the transformation what does the transforming what is the transforming power it's the spirit what was he transformed by what what quickened jesus the word of god but we know it was the spirit of god but why was it the spirit of god because it was the word of god i'll not leave thy soul in hell and i'll not suffer my holy one to see corruption so the word of god and the spirit of god worked together they're the same thing
