========================================

That eagle all his life would bump against the chicken wire fence and that was as far as he could go. All of his life, however long it was, his entire life, he would walk and he would hit the north side, the east side, the west side, and no matter what he tried, there's no getting through it. But one day in a moment of time, a heavenly scream changed everything. Amen. It doesn't matter how long you've bumped against the chicken wire. You can have a damaged relationship with a family member and you hit the chicken wire. Listen, all it takes is a scream from heaven. One moment can change everything. Amen. You can have difficulty in your marriage and you think it's been this way 25 years, 30 years, it'll always be that. It won't always be that way. There's no such thing as a dead-end road. Amen. a difficulty with a relationship with your child, with a spouse, with somebody else, don't ever don't ever don't ever give up hope. Amen. Don't ever stop believing. Because listen, if you're in a marriage that's hit a dead end and going nowhere, if you don't believe, who will? Amen. If you've got a relationship with a child that's broken and they and it needs to be restored and they need to come to the Lord, if you quit believing, who's going to believe? God needs somebody to believe his word. God needs somebody to have faith that it's not impossible. That it's not over. That the story's not finished yet. There's no period at the end of this. All this is is chicken wire. That's right. Amen. It only has me bound because there's things I don't yet understand. It's only a barrier because I haven't yet heard the scream that gets me over it. But it's not a limit to God. It's only a temporary limit to me. It won't last. It won't stand. Remember, whatever situation you find yourself in, if you stop believing, how will deliverance come? If you give up, you're the one in the situation. You're the one who has to believe. Don't let a little chicken wire cause you to lose heart. It's just a hop, skip, and a jump at the right time. And that chicken wire is no barrier at all. We got to stop making things big. They're not big. We got to stop making problems insurmountable. We have to stop making things, you know, colossal. You're only thinking that way because we're thinking from an earthly perspective. But from a heavenly perspective, it's not colossal. It's tiny. The problem that's big to you is tiny to your partner. And the part that you need supernatural deliverance for, for God, it's not supernatural. It's just normal. Amen. Cuz God's not supernatural. What we call supernatural is God's everyday life. Amen. To supernatural to him is normal. Yeah. So if you need supernatural, well, praise God to our partner. That's normal. Yeah. Amen. So don't give up. Don't stop believing. Don't quit because God will remove every barrier. Whether it's a red sea, a piece of chicken wire, or whatever it is, God has the solution. Keep believing, keep moving, keep pressing, keep doing all that you can do and then believe your partner to do the part you can do.
