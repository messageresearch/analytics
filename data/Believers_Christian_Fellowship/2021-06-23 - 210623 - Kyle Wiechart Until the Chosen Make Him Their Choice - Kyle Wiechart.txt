be a lot of him available for you amen well god bless you it's an honor to be here with you again i am makes me feel good that i can help a little bit even to give brother chad a little break some rest and always an honor to be able to just come and talk about the lord a little bit here so no matter how little it is if it's him we're satisfied and it always serves this purpose like bread upon the water he said it won't return into a void it always serves its purpose so i sure appreciate you all coming out tonight and we'll just have some fun fellowshipping around him um [Music] i have a little testimony before we start is that okay a lot of change my daughter today she had uh had a friend over and that friend lost her keys and she was uh kind of running around the house for about an hour and they couldn't find it and so callie came in and she's kind of running around i says have you prayed and she said yeah i prayed twice and i said but did you believe and she said yes i believe i said well then just trust the lord keep on walking and keep looking you'll find it she said okay she walked out the door she said don't worry everybody we're going to find it and they found it instantly i said well praise the lord you know i'm glad when they when she came back she's like dad you're not gonna believe it i'm like i do believe it i do believe it right callie i believe it so sometimes you just have to believe after you pray that god's going to do what you've asked him to do because we you ask sometimes a myth because you don't believe when you ask that's the problem he's i believe he's just waiting to show himself strong on our behalf i really believe that i think he looks for those opportunities where they're back doing the corner and just say oh just call me on the scene i'm ready to go and i appreciate that that he did that for cali and uh so i thought you might be blessed in that um we'll just go right to the word that's okay a little bit more in my comfort zone um just turn to hebrews chapter 3 verse 16. hebrews chapter 3 verse 16. don't exactly know um the the entire direction of this it's one of those things that's you kind of been i've been just meditating on the lord and different things have been jumping out to me and you just kind of grab them all and you you just carry them out here and just kind of curious what the lord will do with it so it's interesting you you walk by faith and not by sight and i just believe that god has a purpose and little inspirations and little feelings and god always makes it work out right hebrews 11 hebrews 3 16 for some when they had heard did provoke howbeit not all that came out of egypt by moses but with whom was he grieved forty years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believed not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from from the foundation of the world next scripture please joshua chapters 24. joshua 24 13 says and i have given you a land for which you did not labor cities that you did not build are built not and ye dwell in them of the vineyards and of the olive yards which he planted not planted not do ye eat now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve ye the lord for if it seems evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land he dwell but as for me in my house we will serve the lord will you add will you bow your heads heavenly father lord we just come before you thankful lord with grateful hearts do we come lord knowing that you called us lord you elected us and you brought us together as a people father i believe that you've ordained this night i believe you've ordained everybody that's sitting and the one that's speaking father i just trust and believe lord that you're going to speak through me and the other counterpart the attribute that you've placed in the bride will hear and believe in those that are sitting before me father i just pray that lord you would come down may your holy spirit have free course lord search our lives search our hearts search our minds lord if there be anything wicked if there be anything that we are carrying with us that cannot continue i pray lord that you would search it out root it out lord take it away from us we don't want to be in your presence with something that is not right lord we want your will we want your ways we want we want to die a greater death to ourselves so that you can have a greater expression in us father so lord i commit this evening all the words into your hands shut my mind to anything that would be contrary lord let me just say what you once said lord we love you and thank you in jesus name amen amen you may be seated i will say i am a is a little bit of a privilege for me this first time i've spoken you don't have masks so i'm very happy it's a strange thing it's the little things in life at this point that make you a little bit happy i get to look out and see all smiles no frowns all smiles we are we are happy people um so it it it's good good to see you guys well your face um i did want to say too i was thinking about brother nathaniel being here i really appreciated the service i think we all were blessed by that and i was just kind of contemplating some of those things that he was saying and i was i was thinking about you know brother banham tells a little story about a violin and that violin was an instrument that was put maybe in a corner couldn't be used for very good of anything but see it was uh he said but in the hands of the master oh my he could play quite a tune and and i got to think you know we're all instruments and in our lives we we may not be able to do very much with it our lives uh can't bring can't play much of a tune let's say with the life that maybe we may we do or what we do with our life but if we'll surrender to the hand of the master he can do things with it we never thought possible because he speaks of the old bible and what are the believers the words on the book and so just because submitting what we got in the little way that we got it into the hands of the master i'm convinced he can play quite a tune and i was so blessed by it and i just was really encouraged by brother nathaniel i have a title tonight and i'm kind of going all around to get there i have a title i'd just like to speak on for a little bit until the chosen make him their choice until the chosen make them him their choice and a little this inspiration for me is coming from some thoughts that i've had here lately in regards to none of us would doubt that we are the chosen of god you believe you're the chosen of god you believe god worked diligently and to seek you out to call you to elect you to bring you out of egypt to bring you out of bondage to bring you out of denominational ideas and traditions of man you would all none of you doubt that and we would rejoice in that we would rejoice in the fact that god had paid a great price and he he he went and had a great victory in redeeming us and bringing us into himself and sometimes i can i can i can i don't know how to say this exactly but sometimes i think we can get too comfortable in just the fact that we're rejoicing in the fact that we've been chosen but do you realize you've been chosen to make a choice like it sounds like strange things but it's actually the truth you've been chosen you know israel was an elect people of god they were god's chosen people god had sent them a prophet god ordained that man and used that man and vindicated his ministry so perfectly that no one could deny that this was the man that god was using to deliver us out of the out of the bondage of egypt but that purpose was to bring them out not to just bring them out and say praise god we are the chosen people but along a wilderness journey he was going to test them try them and see what choice they would excuse me make along the journey to see if they would be worthy to enter into the rest the promised lands of god right and so we find sometimes that just because we're rejoicing the fact that we are chosen that's good i do too but i believe it was more than that i believe that we see we can see this in israel we can see it with elijah we can see it in the life of esther we can see that they there is a chosen group of people that along the wilderness journey and in their time of testing they've got to make a choice i've got to make mine you've got to make yours we all have to make a certain choice because i find it interesting in the bible here he said in genesis 3 let us make man in our own image in the image of god in image of god created man male and female right male and female what is male and female male is seed giver female seed receiver so god when he created man he made us both male and female and he separated that feminist portion and put it in another body so there's another body on this earth that's to be the receiver of the seed and i'm saying that in the sense that now you have to realize what brother branham said about god he said god believed his own word and created the world sometimes we get to think well god just spoke god didn't just speak he believed what he spoke and it was the receiving of the seed that could bring into manifestation everything that you see you see how vitally important the bride is do you see the veil changing from male to female it's just the veil it's just god and more fade it's god bringing himself into reality but it's just as much the pure word of god needed in this day and age as there was someone on the scene that could actually receive it believe it and act on it it's both sides of the story we would none of us deny that we have a perfect interpretation of the word of god with divine vindication but where is the people that actually believe that perfect word of god with divine vindication that can bring it into a manifested state upon this earth as living epistles so many times we can sit here and say praise god i know i'm a chosen okay praise god that you know you're a part of the chosen but can you say praise god i'm choosing him while he chose me the only way you can choose him is you humble yourself you take his yoke upon you my burden is light but that means you take his word each and every day and apply it and this is my thought and i have a weird way i have strange i know i'm strange i get it i'm ok sorry but it's like brother branham came and he's going to clothe us in the wedding garments of the word so we have a perfect word that we can present ourselves to to god almighty for this wedding right and that i don't know how to do this but let's say there's a figure of a woman and it's a dress let's say it's like this okay i do nothing more than this let's say this is the dress but i'm like this now i could say that's the right dress that is the perfect word of god i can rejoice in the fact that that is absolutely the truth but you realize that i've got to get this and that you realize that see i don't i just move on you get word pictures you understand what i'm saying it's a funny way of saying i believe that we have a perfect word but i believe that that word is supposed to be cutting me down to size to get into it i'm not here to just say praise god i'm chosen praise god i'm chosen praise god i'm chosen i'm rejoicing i'm rejoicing in the fact there's there's something on the inside of me there's some portion of god that's saying cut me slice me put me on a diet do whatever you got to do get me in that dress get me in that dress i want to just fit that dress i'm not going to come to god any other form than what the prophet of god laid out as the form which which he has to be in to approach him but that takes you like god can do one portion of it he gave his word but now he's looking for the other side the woman that can receive it and that's what cuts you down to size that is what cuts you down the size i want to take some time and just continue look at that with elijah you could turn to first kings 18. first kings 18 says elijah came unto all the people and said how long hawkey between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word here was israel in this hybridized mixture of worship to god both with their idea idolatry and some form of mixed in religion there for worshiping jehovah it was a mixture and here comes elijah and elijah god's mercy to the people was to send elijah and what did they do they all gather around and he calls them to it he rebuilds the altar brother banham says he or the bible says he rebuilt the altar and in the evening time all men gather around to see this great showdown again between god and the prophets of balaam right and so every man is gathered around and in first kings 18 says and the fire of the lord fell and consumed i'm sorry if the lord be god follow him if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word i find that tremendous the people won't respond at this point there in verse 21 now in verse 38 then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and said the lord he is the he is the god the lord he is the god so in the service they had a great showdown and in the service with god's prophet on the scene every man fell it says all the people worshiped and said this is god everybody did when in the service when the prophet of god is there and the fire of god is coming down to vindicate the word that's been spoken all men no man could doubt it every man said this is the lord but if you look further on in first kings after elijah has this great showdown and he kills the 400 prophets of balaam then at the threat of a woman you know his eagle eye got filmed over but god wanted to get him to himself there's another side of it but when he was out there he says in first kings 19 18 yet i have left me seven thousand in israel all the knees which have not bowed unto balaam and every mouth which had not kissed him i thought all the men bowed i thought everybody had declared that this is god you know in the service they did but when the service was over when the fire wasn't falling anymore when there wasn't the vindication right there in front of them that this is the prophet of god and this is the word of god and this is god moving when it went back to normal life a little kiss here a little worship over here a little compromise to keep my fellowship and in god's eyes what was that idolatry see all of them in the service had no problem saying we will worship god but when it came to everyday life decisions they didn't stay with him they didn't you know what they did they committed idolatry and god refused him he forsook them these were god's chosen people israel was god's chosen people but out of all of those chosen there was only seven thousand in there that would choose him they were chosen but there was only a small group that actually chose him they wouldn't make a slight compromise they wouldn't bow and kiss a little idol for maybe a job or a career family fellowship or friendship or anything like that you see you bring it to present tense we have a role to play too and what i find out is the more i'm looking at the word of god you know this i won't say sisters i'll say brothers too you clean a house if you clean it at night it looks pretty clean but the brighter the light shows a lot of dust i believe the more presence and time you spent in the present in the word it starts to do something in your own life where you now feel yourself you see the little slight blemish compromises along the way how many times brother branham says will you as a preacher shirk someone's you don't want to hurt somebody's feelings so you won't preach the truth you know now here's my question your messiahs how many times for the sake of maintaining a relationship with a friend or a family member will you not confront something that you know you should and say it's right or say it's wrong or take your stand because you don't want to lose a friend you don't want to hurt a relationship you know what you're doing you're making decisions based upon human emotions and not upon your revelation of it's better to honor god than to keep a few friends on this earth jesus said if you if they hated me they will hate you he said woe is you to when all men speak well of you the truth of the matter is if all men speak well of you i doubt that you're taking very much of a stand with him because everybody rejects him but if everybody in the world loves you something's wrong i wonder if you're you know kissing bale a little bit i wonder if you're you know compromising a little bit here and there you know for a job for a relationship for family for lost loved ones for lost children i don't believe in that i don't believe in any of that i believe god has a people that would choose him the disciples said what about us lord we forsook all we left mothers and fathers and all of these things and i have this thought in my mind you know what jesus when they came to jesus and he says hey your mother and brothers are here he said who is my mother and brothers those that do the will of god they are my mother and they are my brothers who is my family my family is the one i'm looking at my family are the ones that do the will of god that's my mother that's my brothers but you see there's these slight little compromises along the way that are actually proving you're not making him your choice hebrews 11 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him without faith means there's no human intellectual understanding and saying well i'll do a little bit of this with a little bit of this and hopefully i'll get a good result not going to work guys either apply the word with faith or it does not produce anything just like my daughter she could pray but she had to believe that god was going to honor the word and james it says wherefore lay apart all filthiness and super superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls but be ye doers of the word and not hears only deceiving yourselves what a deception that is the worst of deceptions is you're hearing the word constantly but you're failing to put it into action and you're the most deceived of all completely deceived what good is to hear the word if we don't obey it what good is it if we don't apply it if we don't take god at his word what good is it it can't actually produce anything you understand that the seed can sit right there on this table and will never bring forth a life but if it falls into good ground a faith to receive it and believe it it will produce but that's a conscious choice you must make every single day i want you to turn to esther brother chad brought this out when we were looking at it and you know god's been very gracious to us i believe you know i do you believe that god moves the ministry to say the things that need said at the right time in the right way to mold ascension see i actually believe that the holy spirit is anointing the things that are being said i don't think we're gathering around just saying that was a good one no i think that's oh god god just checked us you know brother nathaniel he opened up his eyes and said hey you didn't play the right tune at the right way at the right time you know with the composer so when the ministry is addressing something to us as a people i believe that's god speaking correcting us getting us into the right form so we can put on the wedding garment and approach him the right way i believe that i don't believe anything is by accident i believe that god is intimately involved in every detail of my life i believe he's involved in every detail of this church and the ministry that preaches and the things they preach i believe are ordained of god at the time that they speak them they're serving some purpose and when brother branham or when brother chad was bringing out there with vashti and esther and we see that there was a dominating woman spirit there that was there present in the presence of the king that wanted to usurp her authority and usurp her will and usurp her ways and not come to subjection to the king's will i believe that was a warning i believe like when brother nathaniel said hey you better follow the sheet music and you better play your tune you can't be saying hey i want to have a solo part i can't be saying oh i wish i was a different instrument i believe that god is looking for us to play the right tune in the right way to say the right thing in the right way to play our part because this is his it's about him this whole thing is about him you know i don't want to just be glorying in the fact that i'm the bride i want to be glorian in the fact that hi god found a person that's willing to obey him that's willing to believe him and accept him not just say i'm so happy that i'm a bride i am so happy i'm a bride but i pray that i am one of those chosen ones that will constantly be making him my choice every single day and esther it says here and i i want to read this whole portion of this okay esther chapter 2 verse 9 if you're turning there and the maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him and he speedily gave her her things for purification with such things as belonged to her the seven maidens which were meet to be given her out of the king's house and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place in the house of the women esther had not showed her people nor her kindred for mordecai had charged her that she should not show it and mordecai walked every day in the court of the women's of the house to know how esther did and what should become of her now when every man made turn was come to go into king azariah after that she had been 12 months according to the manner of the women for so were the days of her prayer of purification accomplished to which six months with oil and myrrh in six months with sweet odors and the other things for the purifying of the women then thus came every maiden unto the king whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women to the custody of the king's chamberlain which kept the concubine she came in unto the king no more except the king delighted in her and that she were called by name now when the turn of esther the daughter of iblimalai the uncle of mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what haggai the king's chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed and esther obtained favor in the sight of all of them that looked upon her so esther was taken unto the king azarias unto his house royal in the 10th month which is the the the month of tabeth in the seventh year of his reign and but obviously brother chad pointed that out revelations 10 7. and the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than the more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of vashti so i'm bringing that out in the sense that if you remember there's more than just two women on the scene here there's more than just a vashti and there's not just an esther there's a lot of fair young virgins that were chosen there were quite a few and not a one of the people could say hey choose me choose me no they were chosen they didn't go submit a form and say look i'm prettier than most of the people in this town no these were chosen virgins and they all went through a time of purification but if you'll notice along that way they all had one opportunity and that opportunity was they were going to have one chance to present themselves before the king and how they presented themselves to the king dictated his choice of them but actually if you look at it with esther she was the only one that made the king her choice because she only required those things that were haggai and haggai had been in the presence of the king haggy i knew what the king wanted and what he desired and and also esther had seven maidens where were they from the king's house so seven made in seven church ages in the presence of the king these seven maidens were there for her getting ready to approach into the king so out of all of these virgins that were chosen only one made him her choice only one she required nothing more she didn't say i'm going to add a little bit more she didn't say i'm going to take a little bit away from it no she said she called a little revelation she must have known they knew what they were talking about something down on the inside she said i'm not gonna take one thing more than what he desires she knew that haggai and these seven maidens had been in his presence from the king's house they knew what he was looking for they knew it and i am convinced maybe it's just me now this is kyle but i'm convinced when the king saw her he must have noticed she didn't require anything else there wasn't anything more she was trying to bring to the table she wasn't kind of painting up her face she wasn't trying to make herself more glamorous she wasn't trying to make herself more beautiful she must have had something that he noticed inside of her it must have been a character to just do what he desires nothing more nothing less remember there's no beauty that we should desire him and the brother bam said there's no beauty that we should desire here she is attracted to the i'll get to it but brother branham says what attracts his attention humble obedience to the word that attracts the attention of our king that's all that attracts he's not looking for how great you can do anything he just wants to see how obedient you'll be with the little things that's what attracts the king and that's the kind of bride he was looking for he's trying to find a wife that is complementary to his nature and that is one of complete obedience to the word you understand what i'm saying i'm sorry i like to keep going if that's okay though to lay these things in in choosing of a bride he says now notice it's interesting how you notice that the churches tries to attract the attention of people with their fine robes and their dressed choirs and their bobbed hair women and their painted faces and they think that they can sing like an angel and then lie like a devil and run around all day and night and dance and think nothing about it and that's what they think it's all right see it's beautiful but you see that's false made that is not the word of god while the true bride will attract his attention the attention of god by keeping his word notice let us notice christ but he didn't come in a kind of beauty he always comes in the beauty of character there christ wasn't big beautiful strong and stout god doesn't choose that kind of a man he ain't looking for great big shiny things he's looking for simple quiet obedience no beauty it really is no beauty it could be simply conducting yourself at work in a godly manner and that'll be the attraction of the king it could be a wife that stays in subject into her husband and that's all he was looking for it could be you just played the instrument that was giving you at the right time the way he wanted to to complete his great symphony like brother nathaniel spoke about it could just be that are you content in that are you looking for something great grand and shiny because if you are you won't find him you won't find him i think so many times we want tickled a little bit we want to be flashy we want to see something flash we want to do something flash we want to do something that looks great in the eyes of man but it doesn't look great in the eyes of god that's not what he was looking for and the masterpiece he says she is smitten from the church from the church body she is smitten with her master for what the same purpose she is the word just the same as joseph was smitten from his brethren because he was the word jesus was smitten from his brethren because he was the word and the churches me and the brightest and from the church because she is the word there is your stages again one two three exactly the word living and in action the bible bride not some man-made bride some bible the bible bride is a smitten and afflicted of god with no beauty that we should desire her but we did esteem her smitten and afflicted of god that's right she stands alone she stands alone but she doesn't stand alone completely there'll be one standing with her it'll be him and it's so interesting because that is the bride we want to be i mean can any of you say i want to be stricken smitten of god and cast down when you're willing to say that you'll find him you see what i'm saying it's like in everyday life are you realizing that to take the word it's not always comfortable it's not easy it's not always shouting it's not always the fire coming down and we can all rejoice and say god is our god no it's in the everyday life living a life that's worthy of the gospel everyday life not putting a relationship or a job or a situation above the willing word of god it's an everyday life that enoch walked out of this world i don't think it was one great service i think it was consistently daily taking one step higher one step higher one step higher every day he's my choice every day i believe the word every day i don't care about my emotions or my feelings or my affections every day i want to be found receiving the word and believing uniting time as the bridegroom being the word and the bride being the hearer of the word they come together in a union they unite like a wedding see they're getting ready for the wedding the word becomes you and you become the word i was really provoked this last week i had a conversation with the man i shared it with brother chad this man i had met him nine years ago in the parking lot of meyer i used to go to church with him and he had said uh we he came over the house we got to talk about the lord and he stayed for kerry would know i don't know it's like i don't know five six hours just talking about the lord and i never ran into him again and he showed up at my office this last week and he wanted to talk about the lord we went to panera and we spent five hours talking about the lord and i honestly was provoked and encouraged because you know what he said he said my brother his wife left him so we started to study marriage and divorce and you know what i come to find out he said almost everybody in my church is living in adultery and they don't know it everybody he said the bible says in ezekiel their blood will be on my hands if i don't say something to them and so you know what he's done it provoked me to righteousness into good works he said i have went to every one of them one on one to their house and showed them these scriptures and say we have a problem he went to every one of them he went to his mom he went to his best friend he went to all the members in his church and he told me you know what my best friend told me he said it won't be long you won't have a friend left on this earth he said i'll always have one and i said god bless you man i appreciate that i appreciate a man he's not a believer of the message yet we'll see i don't know he's listening to the indictment so but i said man you don't find that very often this man the portion of the word that he has he's willing to do everything he can he said i have to declare righteousness i have to tell them the truth he says the bible says no fornicators adulterers the feminists shall enter into the kingdom of heaven these people don't even know they're sitting under ministries that are telling them lies they think they're okay and they are not i said god bless you man god bless you one by one losing every friend he had well not everyone was in adultery but the majority of everyone that he fellowshipped with and then they ran him out of the church because he was causing major problems with the assembly so now he's just kind of wandering he wandered over to my shop there last week so pray for him but i think that's something that should be inside of us i don't think we should constantly be looking of i want to stay comfortable i don't want to cause problems i want everybody to like me i want to get along with everybody i'm sorry i don't believe that's what a christian does in this day and age how can we live in satan's eden with this nonsense and only come and shout and praise god at the service and then go out and kiss baal out and be friends with the world i don't think we can do that anymore i think that is done i think we're going to have one opportunity one opportunity to present ourselves in the right wedding garment before the king and i don't want to be one of those fair young virgins that were chosen just to present what kind of life and style and presentation i wanted to give him i want to be presenting to him what he desired and only what fits in that is all i want to bring to him and if it doesn't fit god help me get me in that dress cut me shape me put me on a strict lettuce diet i don't know whatever you got to do get me in that dress you know what i'm saying i'm not just saying i'm not sometimes we come and we when we shout we praise god and we should praise god but you realize that this word was given to you to mold you to shape you to get you into the form of his bride it's not just something we rally around and just say praise god we rally around with humble bowed faces and tears saying god i'm not fitting in that dress get me in that you do what you got to do you cut me to pieces you shred me you fall you fall let me fall upon the rock and be broke into pieces i gotta get in there you know when i came out here i looked in the mirror when i you know that's funny i'm sorry when i look in the mirror so i look in the mirror i don't say that's a handsome man i don't do that no i say man doing the best i can with what i got you know what i'm saying i mean how vain would you be to look in the mirror and say i am one good-looking man you know what i'm saying yeah a sister is it's just you know when you're young you do that maybe when i was young i'd sit there and say not too bad not too bad now i like to say too many oreos that's what that is that's too many horrors right brother shea it's too many oreos me and him love foreign but you know what i'm saying so that's a natural maybe funny way i don't mean to be joking and distract me but when we look into this word and we can see there's the bride there's the bride there's the bride there's the bride there's the bride we don't say that's awesome yeah i am something special wow i'm all over the place he must you see what i'm saying i'm not trying to say it in the wrong way and there's a balance of that because she is special she's beautiful she's wonderful but to see that that is she is that important to him and she must be a certain way she must have a certain life a certain attitude a certain walk if he's showing me it that many times i better be taking a very close look in that mirror and making sure everything is in order because it must be extremely important understand what i'm saying because i think sometimes you can get a little slanted view on that get to thinking i'm super special i am pretty awesome i know you must be wanting to make sure you better see what i'm looking for and i don't say those things to discourage you because even in myself there's a lot that i don't like and there's a lot that isn't getting in that dress yet but by god's grace i know that he put something down on the inside that receives that word and is believing that word and that word will take a hold and produce its own life my job my responsibility is just to believe it and accept it and obey it to be a doer of the word to be the recipient to be the other side of the portion of god the feminine side to just receive that word believe that word knowing that that life is in the seed and it will bring forth christ that's our job that's our responsibility and that's the bride he's looking for a bride that chooses him daily in choosing of the bride he says now stop a minute men look at your creeds that you're serving look at your churches is it just exactly the word of god have you met every qualification say i'm a good man well so was no nicodemus and so was the rest of them they were all very fine that don't have a thing to do with it women i want you to look in the mirror look into what god requires a woman to do see in god's mirror not in your church mirror god's mir and see if you could qualify in your life to be the spiritual bride of jesus christ ministers think the same do you cut corners here to save somebody's feelings would you do this if it wasn't they'll put you out of the church if you have a feeling in that way my dear brother i warn you in the name of jesus christ you flee from that right now i'm not the prophet of god but i would say if you're doing things for people's feelings i warn you in the name of jesus christ you're not measuring up to the qualifications of the bride of jesus christ we must all be looking into this mirror i think we've been thoroughly rebuked on religion versus relationship and that the fact is too many of us were comparing ourselves one with another and saying we're not too bad but i want to tell you in light of this mirror right here this mirror right here you're not fitting in you might not be able to get in that dress you may be chosen now it's your turn many fair young virgins many fair young virgins only one made him her choice it's okay to keep going this is going to take a strange turn titus 2 3. titus 2 3. it says the aged woman likewise that they be in behavior as becometh holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands and to love their children to be discreet chaste ver keepers at home good obedient to their husbands that the word of god be not blasphemed now i'm not now i'm saying what i'm going to say in light of this this is a type of the true church of the living god the things that she must maintain and the things that must be her priority just as in the natural realm this does not say older women instruct your younger women how to keep a career how to have a great social life how to do anything beyond take care of your homes take care of your children take care of your children or your husbands you realize that be discreet be chaste be quiet be obedient you understand now i won't go any farther than that you you deal with that how you feel but the church of the living god must be following the same type in a spiritual manner as that woman is her only objective is her home her fam her husband and her children that's it beyond that i'm adding to what he wants out of me following down brother branham says this in the invisible union of the bride of jesus christ now we find that she was given a sacred trust that she must not break of womanhood have her character to raise her children and to be honorable unto her husband nowadays they pay a bit more attention to that than nothing in the world you ought to set in my office sometime and see the type of women men bring in there where they try to get right with god and confess all the men that they've been with and everything else since they've been married i'm speaking of how it can get that way when you get to mixing up with the world and the church and the fashions of these things that we have you're no more like the original pentecostal was in that day from night you've drifted away somewhere into dark chaos somewhere and you're lost what a sacred trust what a responsibility to a woman now we see why she's a type of the church which has the same responsibility as a woman has a sacred responsibility to motherhood to her virtues to her husband the church has a sacred responsibility to prayer and to the word and to christ just the same as this woman has you see you have one thing you must be concerned with prayer the word and obedience to christ that is you the church of the living god the bride of his choosing that is your role anything outside of that not pleasing to him just as a natural you have your three things if any of those things go lacking i don't care what it is you're doing you're disobedient god and you could be bringing blasphemy to the very things you stand for that's what the word says bible or brother brahm says here in lifting him up out of history we have a home life crisis it seems to me like the home is running on shallow water it used to be that in the home the father the head of the house would sit down in the morning he would speak to his family and they would all gather around the old family bible they would read a little bit and they would all gather around the table and have prayer you don't see that no more and when the and when the day was done ma would wash the dishes and then they would all gather around and read some more of the bible and then they would pray and go to bed no beauty in that is there that looks pretty simple looks kind of old-fashioned can we say that we fit into that dress as our homes look like that as our as your sacred motherhood and your sacred family and obedience to the word of god and you're putting the right things in the right place they're in their right priority i have to i'm speaking to me just as well just so you know i'm prioritizing i have to reprioritize there's certain things i love fellowship but what good is fellowship outside the home if my own home isn't set in order the way it ought to be we don't want to measure up to the church we want to measure up to the word that's my mirror that's my glass that i'm supposed to be looking into intently each and every day brother branham says about moses moses had to make a choice moses being the messenger of deliverance to the people of israel god had to give him a choice and now remember moses would have to type that of brother branham moses was given an opportunity brother branham said he could have been pharaoh he could have been king on earth he could have had all the money the popularity everything he wanted this natural flesh could ever desire moses it was offered to him he was chosen he was elected of god but he still had to make a choice he still had to make a choice and the bible says he chose christ suffering choosing rather to suffer the reproach of christ esteeming christ greater riches than that of egypt right now here's what he says he rejected the popularity he could have had young girls by the hundreds and he could have had sep curse in egypt and had ruled the world the world laid right at his feet he was heir to all of it but by looking in the scripture and seeing the day that he was living in he knowed he knowed that something was in him a predestinated seed went to of god went to work i don't care how popular you could be i don't care how you could be a presbyter you could be a pastor you could be this you could be that but if that word of eternal life god's eternal life by god's word has been foreordained in you you will see that thing at hand and it goes to work moving out like that and he refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter because he esteemed the reproach of christ greater riches than the riches of egypt or of this world he esteemed that watch what he done he followed it up quickly he was ousted by his people and the people that once loved him you know it might cost you everything it might cost you your home it might cost you your friendship it might cost you your stitch and soap party it might cost you your place there in the kiwanis it might i don't know what it will cost you but it will cost you everything that this world or pertains to this world you will have to separate yourself in everything that's worldly moses laid aside everything and went into a desert with a stick in his hand days went by and he wondered did i make a mistake no many times people start off and they say oh i'll do i'll do it glory to god and then someone laughs at you and makes fun of you and then you begin to wonder did i do wrong he said they they cannot stand chasm if they cannot stand chastisement they are bastard children and not children of mine see they worked up all in emotion but if that see that seed that i talked about a while ago the soul wasn't there to start with it was anointed with the spirit and he'd done all kinds of things you see he was just anointed on his spirit but when the real holy ghost comes in it produces a life and that's the reality of it you've got to go through a testing moses had to go through his testing but what is it if you're a predestinated seed of god if you are the elect bride of jesus christ you'll look at anything of this world and say it's worth giving that up to follow this word he is worth everything to me so just as moses had to make a choice brother branham had to make a choice brother branham wasn't only just the seven church age messenger he's also a type of the bride brother branham marriage and divorce because thou hast chosen the narrow path the harder way thou hast walked in your own choosing thou has picked the correct and the precise decision and it was my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven will await thee what a glorious decision thou hast made now you know the next this in itself is that which will give and make to come to pass the tremendous victory in love divine he made a choice he had to make a choice he was called of god he was a prophet of god but along the way he had to make his own choice and because he was a predestinated seed of god he would choose the right way this shall make and come to bring to pass a tremendous victory in love divine when you can make him your choice not that he chose you which he did but now a tremendous victory in divine love will be when you can choose him just as your prophet chose him so does this bride choose him if you think about it this is revelations 10. uh oh okay let me fill this in first sorry i just skipped the true easter seal i could go that way i sure could brother bam says see you choose it yourself moses had to make his choice he didn't have to do it neither did i have to take this path i could have had big buildings out yonder and some of them things i could have been all across the television but who would sponsor me uh on tearing tearing the very foundation but one thing i don't have to bow down to nobody but to the lord jesus christ that's right yes i get to preach what the bible says and i don't have to compromise with any of their organizations i don't have to belong to none of them i made my choice just like he said up there as i was with moses so will i be with you he made christ his choice he had an opportunity god gave him one god blessed him in this ministry god blessed him in his service and god gave him a choice god will bless you he will do mighty wonderful wonderful works for you but then he'll want to see what kind of choice you're going to make it's a momentous decision as it is in revelations chapter 7 so is it in revelations chapter 8 and i heard a voice that spake from heaven say to me again and said go take the little book that's in that's open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went to the angel and i said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it will make thy belly bitter but in thy mouth it will be sweet as honey a word spoken but then it had to be taken it had to be a choice a something inside of you that says give it to me it's mine just as brother branham what is the third pole his hands are up and then a sword strikes his hand he says that's the king's sword but what did he say it took a strong hand of faith to hold it so it must take a strong predestined hand it's predestinated hand to be able to take a hold of this word just as it was in the prophet so must it be a strong dead or strong predestinated hand of faith of this bride of his choosing that will choose him and take the word and the word only i'd like to read one more i'm going fast i like to lay the scripture in ii timothy 3 1 and this know also that in the last days perilous times come shall come from men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient unthankful and unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded and lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god didn't say that they didn't love god just loved pleasure more than god you know sing and shout and praise god when the fire is falling there and consuming the sacrifice on a sunday and wednesday but on the other days having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof from such turn away for of this sword is those that lead that creep into houses and lead cr lead captive silly women laden with sins led away with diverse loves lusts ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of truth now as janus and jammer swiss did moses so that these would resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith but they shall proceed no further for the father far further for their folly shall be made manifested unto men as theirs was also but thou has fully known my doctrine my manner of life my purpose faith long-suffering charity and patience persecutions and afflictions which came to me at antioch and at ikeanum at lystra what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me yea and all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution amen one thing's for sure paul gave us a good example of what that bride looks like she will suffer greatly for him she has to he's worth it matthew 11 come unto me all ye that laban are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon me upon you and learn of me i meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light i'd like to play something if it's okay just for a little bit i had brother franco cue it up i could read it but no one can say it better than brother branham sometimes brother franco could you uh play that small portion from the rapture i remember that night before i seen that i've seen the preview of the bride i stood there and seen a beautiful little lady's just correctly dressed and they marching this way there's somebody standing by me in the division and i've seen that said the preview of the bride i've seen her go by they come on this side went around not already coming up the churches coming up from this other side there come the asian church oh you talk about phil here come the european church oh my and then i heard a rock and roll coming and it was miss america the church and she didn't even have on any clothes she had papers like newspapers great hold in front of her dancing by rock and roll miss america the church i stood there in his presence i thought oh god as a minister if that's the best we could do oh oh you know how you feel i thought god hiding if i could just get away from here if all that we've done and that's what we have to produce if that's why and then when women pass by all doing all kinds of rocks and things and short hair and painted faces and as it passed by like that's supposed to be virgins the crimes and when she passed by like that i turned my head you know what the this whole land from me is is this graceful the back of them and there was going like and i turned my head they're weeping like i said i couldn't stand it there him stand there and me know that me a minister of the church and that's why i produced for him that's an old god i can't look at it let me die let me let me fade away and like that and as soon as it went out every time one of them would come they go out to a certain place and drop off and i just hear the sound of it as it went away and then i heard something like onward christian soldiers now look here come that sainted bunch of little girls just exactly the way it was all correctly dressed their hairs hanging way down in their back smooth clean marching like this to the step of the gospel she was a word that looked like one out of every nation i was looking at as it passed by and seen them pass by instead of going down they started going up now i noticed one of them trying two three i'm trying to get outline i screamed stay in line and the vision left me and i was standing in this room screaming stay in line lying that wonder could it be already passed could the bride already be called is that what we're going through today she has to be molded and made into the image of christ and christ is the word that's the only thing sits in there in the words ju see there cannot be one thing added it can't be a woman with a one hand like a man and the other hand with a paw like a dog it's got to be exactly the word of the lord like he is the word the bride is a part of the bridegroom the woman is a part of her husband because she's taken out of the husband eve was a part of adam from his side and so is a pride not taken from a denomination but taken from the bosom of the word of god for this day amen that's what we want to be you find the similarities of this preview of the bride esther all these fairy young virgins supposed to be virgins to christ supposed to have been made him their choice but their folly was made known they added to and took away from the word of god and it was not the bride he was looking for he had one that he was looking for and this is what she was exactly what she was will you stand i love you guys i really and i pray that you make him your choice i pray that every day you esteem him greater than anything that this world could offer family friends you know you have different things that you'll have to give up for him we don't have a pharaoh type position that we're giving up but we nonetheless have to give something up we'll have to give up friendships jobs relationships things that are dear to us in this natural world but if it's at the cost of christ it's worth giving up it's just worth giving up i pray that this is a blessing and i pray that you look at the word and seeing the bride in the word and from a condition of saying am i matching am i doing what he said am i actually making am i wanting god to actually shape me and mold me into that image or not let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer heavenly father we come before you lord we do thank you for what you've done and lord we do kind of in a somber way ask that you would forgive us for our many sins forgive us for our many compromises lord we want to be found as that one virgin that makes you your her choice in everyday life in everyday situations not compromising with the world not compromising for the sake of somebody's feelings not compromising not comparing ourselves with our church or one with the other but lord earnestly sincerely looking at your word this revealed truth looking at it looking at you and trying to see do we match or don't we and being honest when we don't and i just pray lord god no doubt you've been searching my heart i pray that you would search the hearts of those that i love so dearly in front of me and those that would listen lord we want to be found as that spiritual bride that you are looking for not just in form but in a living word made manifest father i pray that you would do that i pray that you would quicken us father may and i know that they will that predestinated bride they will make you their choice they will because there's something on the inside calling out for you lord we love you we commit this time into your hands and just thank you for all that you've done i pray you would be with each and every person through every trial and temptation i pray lord that by faith they would take you at your word realizing that the power was in the light it was in the seed if we just receive it you'll go into action on our behalf just commit ourselves to you and the words that were spoken i pray lord that it was all pleasing to thee and i pray lord it was a blessing to your people we love you and thank you in jesus name amen amen brother you got a song please let me be pleasing to you let everything i do be pleasing to you pray let everything i pursued be pleased [Music] let me be pleasing to you let everything i do be pleasing to you pray [Music] please [Music] amen praise the lord you know i think it's good every once in a while to reflect to look hard and fast in the word of god and look at ourselves because there's a way these creepers have a way of creeping in brother ben talked about the little creeper got in and would wind its way slowly around the corner and next thing you know it's pulled it down and it's deformed it it didn't happen overnight it didn't happen instantly it happened so unnoticeably then all of a sudden it deformed the corn and i say lord if there's any creeper getting around me lord cut it away cut it away take this word show me myself and your word and cut away anything that would bring a deformity anything that would not be pleasing to you i was thinking about what he was saying what brother kyle was saying about esther when it came down to it esther was the only one that could give up all her own ideas they all had ideas and no doubt esther had some ideas too she's human like the rest of them they all had ideas on what would be beautiful ideas about what would be presentable ideas about what would be pleasing but when it came down to it esther was the only one that could give up all her own ideas and just submit to what haggai had appointed and there's a bride on the earth today and she's the only one she may have ideas we have ideas we all get ideas but there's one woman that can give up all her own ideas and just take the word i say god i believe i'm that one but i need your help oh god open my eyes show me any area in my life lord that that is not righted show me wherever i'm taking my own idea so that i could surrender that so that when you see me you'll see me the way king ahazera saw esther and he loved her above all the other virtues i want to have that character in me amen are we perfect no but the perfect one has already saw us as perfect what is he looking for character he's looking for the character that'll take the word i say god find it in me by your choice i want to choose you too amen listen i surrender all [Music] surrender all [Music] [Applause] in [Applause] [Music] i surrendered [Music] all to jesus [Applause] [Applause] is take me jesus take me down i surrender i surrendered [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] let me feel the whole [Applause] [Music] i surrendered is [Music] all to jesus [Applause] [Applause] oh glory to his name [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen as we go we can just think on these things but you know it was it was esther's privilege to surrender all it was her privilege to give up her ideas and all her own thoughts and just take what haggy i said though she may not have you know she may not have uh come to that conclusion quickly we don't know how long it took but somewhere along the line she got the idea that everything i think could be wrong but i know this will be right and it became her privilege to surrender her idea it became her privilege to throw it away and after it was all said and done when you get to the end of the story i don't think she had any regrets for laying down her own thinking for surrendering everything that she thought and just take his word you know i don't think is it really a sacrifice to give up what i think for what the word says when we get to the end of the story i think we're going to be in the same spot it was worth it all there's no regrets i didn't lose anything i didn't give up anything it was all game for christ man god bless you as you go we love you it's been good to be back in service with you may god bless make it ever true change my heart oh may i feel like you change my heart change my heart change my heart may i be like i am me this is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh you are [Music] [Applause] hold me and make me this is [Applause] [Music] [Music] it's jesus i really want to see [Applause] [Music] it's jesus i really want of this world the less it means to me for it's jesus that i really want to see [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it's jesus i really want to see [Music] it's jesus that i really want to see and the more i see of this old world the last that i really want to see [Music] there [Music] [Music] there is a mountain that freeze the soul from [Applause] there is a vast supply [Music] there's a river who shall run dry and then a river [Music] that flows from deep within there is a fountain [Music] [Applause] it freezes [Applause] [Music] come to this water there is a vast and there is a river [Music] that never shall run [Music] cause me to come to thy river cause me to come to thy river to come to thy [Music] river to dream and cause me to live [Music] cause me to [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] cause me to come to cause me to drink [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you
