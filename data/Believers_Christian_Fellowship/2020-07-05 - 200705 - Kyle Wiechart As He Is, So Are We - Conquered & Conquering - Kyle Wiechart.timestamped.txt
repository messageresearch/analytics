[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] [Music]
[0:14] more
[0:16] had it all but what i
[0:21] need is just
[0:33] [Music]
[0:52] [Music]
[0:56] more
[1:00] is that your prayer this
[1:11] it morning but what i
[1:15] eat is
[1:29] and yeah
[1:48] can we just sing i love him this time
[1:51] though with no
[1:52] instruments other than your voices
[1:54] musicians if that's okay
[2:11] [Music]
[2:20] uh
[2:22] [Music]
[2:34] now
[2:36] [Music]
[2:49] amen love him amen i love him thank you
[2:53] musicians
[2:54] i really appreciate it uh hello
[2:58] sorry so the surprise it was just as
[3:01] much surprise for you it's a bigger
[3:02] surprise for me i promise you
[3:05] to be here but i'm thankful to the lord
[3:08] that he'd give me the opportunity one
[3:10] more time
[3:11] to surrender this vessel to hopefully
[3:13] bring honor and glory to him
[3:15] and to be able to say something that
[3:16] will help you this morning and that's
[3:18] what i'm trusting and that's the faith
[3:20] that i
[3:20] that gives me the faith to come to the
[3:22] pulpit with a few days notice is
[3:24] this one thing i know i love him and i
[3:27] love this word
[3:28] and i love you and if i didn't love you
[3:30] i would never come to this pulpit i just
[3:32] couldn't do it because i couldn't help
[3:33] you there's nothing i could do to help
[3:34] you
[3:35] but when i know that i got that in line
[3:37] this makes me
[3:38] love you in line too right so i'd just
[3:42] like to
[3:43] take a little thought this morning that
[3:45] was kind of something that helped me a
[3:46] little inspiration for me and
[3:48] i like those little thoughts sometimes
[3:50] you know god hides himself in simplicity
[3:52] sometimes
[3:53] he does things in just such a way you
[3:54] would think how could something so
[3:56] little have such a big effect but he
[3:58] does it all the time
[3:59] he just does things like that and it it
[4:02] creates a humility amongst the believers
[4:04] and it creates such a confidence
[4:06] i know he's mindful of me he's thinking
[4:08] of me
[4:09] and he was he was with me this weekend
[4:11] and i just i knew he was um
[4:13] and this i was just at home you know and
[4:16] friday preparing for the youth meeting
[4:17] because i prepare for youth meetings
[4:18] just like i would prepare for coming
[4:20] here
[4:20] i sure love those youth and i want to be
[4:23] found faithful
[4:24] sanctifying this vessel for their sake
[4:27] so that they
[4:28] they can have something that would be a
[4:29] help to them on a on a friday and
[4:32] you know and but i noticed the thought
[4:34] that i was on just just did something
[4:36] it did something in my home and and the
[4:39] thought kept carrying on to saturday and
[4:41] i
[4:42] could tell and i didn't want to say
[4:43] anything to carrie
[4:45] but i passed by and she was in the
[4:46] bathroom there for a minute and i
[4:48] thought i wonder if she notices that
[4:50] and it's just a thought in my mind i
[4:51] could feel his presence just real strong
[4:54] and so i never said anything to her i
[4:56] just went and sat down because i thought
[4:57] you know if i say something to it she'll
[4:59] read into it a little bit
[5:00] about eight o'clock at night she comes
[5:02] and sits down and i was reading her
[5:04] praying
[5:04] in the chair and she said you you
[5:07] noticed that in the house i said yeah
[5:09] yeah i do she's like i was wondering
[5:12] it just she said do you feel that
[5:13] atmosphere i said yeah i feel it
[5:15] she said it's she said it's have an
[5:17] effect on the kids
[5:19] and if anybody knows my little eliana
[5:22] you know her
[5:26] she is she's a ball of energy and
[5:29] joy and uh but even
[5:32] she was acting funny we caught carrie
[5:35] said she caught her a couple times over
[5:36] and praying
[5:38] that's just strange you know
[5:41] and it just was a strange atmosphere and
[5:44] and i and i and i realized it was
[5:46] something
[5:48] in what i was looking at and even the
[5:50] friday night youth meeting i was so tore
[5:51] up i could barely
[5:52] speak the kids i was crying the whole
[5:55] time and i'm like how could such a
[5:57] little thing
[5:58] have such a big effect but i realized
[6:00] something and
[6:01] that's the thing i just want to share
[6:02] with you tonight i
[6:04] i believe that um he's teaching us
[6:07] something
[6:08] he's showing us there's a way to conquer
[6:10] every fear
[6:11] every doubt every temptation that this
[6:13] world could ever
[6:14] anything the devil could ever throw at
[6:16] you there's something that can overcome
[6:18] but it's just so simple it's just so
[6:21] humble
[6:22] and uh and it'll do things in your home
[6:25] it'll do things
[6:26] amongst your marriage it'll do things
[6:28] for your kids that you never thought
[6:30] possible
[6:31] and all your efforts and struggles and
[6:33] trials
[6:34] you just kind of relax because when he
[6:36] comes on the scene
[6:38] everything else just kind of falls in
[6:39] line everything just
[6:41] works its way out and i know i'm not
[6:44] saying it right but i know what happened
[6:46] in this weekend and i'll tell you
[6:48] something else i
[6:49] i was you know then when brother chad
[6:51] called me i said well it might have been
[6:53] good for the youth but you know to bring
[6:54] that to
[6:55] mature sons and daughters of god you
[6:58] know the royal
[7:00] priesthood i mean how could i how could
[7:02] i bring it to them and
[7:04] i went to prayer again and i said lord
[7:06] you know i maybe i
[7:07] you know i should go a different
[7:08] direction i'll bring something to him
[7:10] that really be taking new ground you
[7:11] know for the people you know and
[7:13] so i went to prayer and i got back up
[7:15] and i just walked out of the bedroom i
[7:16] said now is that his will or your will
[7:19] i said well i don't know i like to take
[7:23] new ground for the
[7:24] for the people maybe it'd help him more
[7:26] and i went and sat down and i
[7:27] i said you know but the inspiration is
[7:29] only leading me one way
[7:31] and so i typed in you know we do all
[7:33] this
[7:34] we google search sometimes our questions
[7:35] are not google search we message search
[7:37] but we don't google search now
[7:40] that's what the world does yeah we don't
[7:42] do that but
[7:44] i put in there i put in when inspiration
[7:46] strikes
[7:48] and i and what popped up was um
[7:51] trying to do god a service without it
[7:52] being his will
[7:55] and it was david you look it up 1965
[7:58] when inspiration strikes it was david
[8:00] brother brown said inspiration struck
[8:02] him to go get the ark
[8:04] but it wasn't right and you keep reading
[8:07] down through there and it was
[8:08] it was micah i'm sorry it was ahab and
[8:11] they wanted to take
[8:12] the land remember he said inspiration
[8:14] struck
[8:15] it was absolutely inspiration that
[8:17] struck them but it wasn't in line with
[8:18] the word
[8:20] and he said there was an evil spirit
[8:21] that came up from underneath a deceiving
[8:24] spirit he said they're so organized
[8:26] i can come in you go look at the quote i
[8:28] can come in and work up their emotions
[8:31] and they'll be deceived by it 1965
[8:34] trying to do god of service
[8:36] so i don't want to be led by my emotions
[8:38] i don't think any of us want to be led
[8:40] by emotions
[8:41] they have an effect but i don't want to
[8:42] be led by them i want to be led by
[8:45] divine revelation
[8:46] and that holy spirit that can lead a
[8:48] lamb wherever he wants me to go that's
[8:50] just where i want to go
[8:52] so let's go
[8:55] so just relax it's it's just uh it's
[8:58] just me sharing my heart tonight this
[8:59] morning
[9:01] so why don't you turn in your bibles to
[9:03] first peter chapter four
[9:10] first peters chapter 4 verse 1.
[9:21] it says for as much then as christ hath
[9:24] suffered for us in the flesh
[9:26] arm yourselves prepare yourselves arm
[9:29] yourselves likewise yourself likewise
[9:32] with the same mind for he that
[9:35] hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased
[9:37] from
[9:38] sin that he no longer should live
[9:41] the rest of his time in the flesh to the
[9:44] lusts of men
[9:45] but to the will of god for in the time
[9:48] past of our life may suffice us to have
[9:50] wrought the will of the gentiles
[9:52] when we walked in lasciviousness and
[9:54] lusts
[9:55] and excessive wine revelings banquetings
[9:59] and abominable idolatries wherein
[10:02] they think it's strange that ye run not
[10:06] with them
[10:06] in the same excess of riot speaking evil
[10:10] of you
[10:11] who shall give an account to him that is
[10:13] ready to judge the quick and the dead
[10:16] for this cause was the gospel preached
[10:20] also to them that are dead
[10:24] that they might be judged according to
[10:27] men in the flesh but live
[10:30] according to the god in the spirit but
[10:33] the end of all things
[10:35] is at hand be therefore sober
[10:38] and watch unto prayer and above all
[10:41] things
[10:42] have fervent charity among yourselves
[10:45] for charity shall cover a multitude
[10:48] of sins and also turn in your bibles to
[10:52] first john
[10:53] chapter 4 16.
[11:01] first john chapter 4 16.
[11:06] these two portions of the scripture i
[11:08] find they parallel each other
[11:11] it says we have known and believed the
[11:14] love that god hath
[11:15] to us god is love and he that dwelleth
[11:19] in love dwelleth in god and god in him
[11:23] herein is our love made perfect
[11:26] that we may have boldness in the day of
[11:29] judgment
[11:30] because as he is so are we in this world
[11:34] there is no fear in love but perfect
[11:36] love casteth thou
[11:38] fear because fear hath torment
[11:41] he that feareth is not made perfect in
[11:44] love
[11:44] we love him because he first loved us if
[11:47] any man say i love god
[11:49] and hateth his brother he is a liar and
[11:52] he that loveth not his brother
[11:54] whom he hath seen how can he love god
[11:57] whom he hath not seen just bow our heads
[12:02] heavenly father lord we just come before
[12:04] you lord with grateful hearts lord that
[12:07] in your mercy and your grace from before
[12:09] the foundation in the world you ordained
[12:11] us to stand here this day
[12:12] and lord i'm so thankful lord that you
[12:15] came by my way one day
[12:17] lord you came by the others that before
[12:19] me one day lord we
[12:21] we weren't looking for you but you came
[12:23] looking for us lord
[12:25] to think of how you were so great and so
[12:27] mighty
[12:28] and you were mindful of a sinner like me
[12:31] a sinner like us lord nothing worthy
[12:33] to to be seen by the king but lord you
[12:36] saw
[12:37] us and lord we've gathered here because
[12:40] we have a confidence lord that you're
[12:41] here in our midst
[12:43] lord we have a confidence that you'll
[12:45] speak through
[12:46] flesh that makes mistakes father you'll
[12:49] hear through flesh that makes mistakes
[12:51] but lord we're
[12:52] being conformed into your image day by
[12:54] day through many sufferings and many
[12:56] trials
[12:57] lord i just pray lord this morning that
[12:59] we could see you face to face
[13:01] because lord the time has come and the
[13:03] hour is here we're no longer looking
[13:05] through a glass
[13:06] dimly father but we're seeing you face
[13:08] to face
[13:09] and all that you are the potential now
[13:12] lies in us to be
[13:13] i pray lord god that you would move have
[13:16] the preeminence take my
[13:18] inabilities lord and my broken up words
[13:20] lord
[13:21] do the supernatural thing amongst your
[13:23] peaceful lord we love you we commit this
[13:25] time into your hands
[13:26] in jesus name amen amen you may be
[13:29] seated
[13:32] so i like to just give this thought a
[13:35] title
[13:36] as he is so are we
[13:40] conquered and conquering
[13:43] as he is so are we conquered
[13:46] and conquering and you see here that um
[13:51] that it says here that in this day of
[13:53] judgment brother chad mentioned you know
[13:55] this
[13:55] the the tremendous chaos and and the uh
[13:59] the fear that's amongst the people and
[14:01] in the land and the anger and the
[14:03] fierceness
[14:04] and this shouldn't take us by surprise
[14:06] it's the day of judgment
[14:08] it's the day of judgment and everything
[14:11] is falling apart around you this doesn't
[14:13] shake us nor are we even concerned with
[14:16] it because for them it's judgment but
[14:18] for us
[14:19] it's the redeeming power of god coming
[14:21] to set us free
[14:22] and at that same time when in that day
[14:25] of judgment
[14:26] we can see very clear here that perfect
[14:28] love begins to manifest
[14:30] because brother branham said when he
[14:32] went beyond the curtain of time only
[14:34] perfect love can enter into this place
[14:37] and danny henry wrote a prophecy and he
[14:39] said and this shall make and come to
[14:40] bring to pass
[14:41] a tremendous victory in the love divine
[14:45] and you know i took that little thought
[14:46] you know me i'm very simple in my mind
[14:48] and
[14:49] i took that thought you know on that
[14:50] picture and sometimes we go back and we
[14:52] look at the picture on the box so we can
[14:53] put the pieces in the right position
[14:55] we have to do that sometimes brother
[14:57] branham said if you see your cow up in
[14:58] the tree
[14:59] eating grass you know you got something
[15:00] wrong with your picture and uh
[15:03] you know for me sometimes i said those
[15:04] straight edges you know remember i need
[15:06] i need something simple for me right
[15:09] i said you know there's those absolute
[15:10] those are straight edges i know this is
[15:12] a great victory
[15:13] of love divine amongst his people i know
[15:16] this entire message
[15:17] is a great victory but you can't have a
[15:19] victory without a great battle
[15:21] you have to have a great battle and you
[15:23] have to have a tremendous enemy before
[15:25] you
[15:26] for it to really be a tremendous victory
[15:28] but the tremendous victory is
[15:30] divine love conquers and divine love can
[15:34] only conquer
[15:35] if divine love has conquered you
[15:39] you know divine love conquered the lord
[15:41] jesus christ so much so that he said
[15:43] it's not my will
[15:44] be done it's thine will be done and that
[15:47] divine love
[15:48] g god brother banham said that divine
[15:50] love that god had
[15:52] produced christ and he gave himself for
[15:55] you and me
[15:57] that that divine love has always been
[15:59] sacrificial that divine love
[16:01] seeketh not itself right it vaunteth not
[16:04] of itself it isn't puffed up it isn't
[16:06] prideful
[16:07] it's so simple it's so humble it abases
[16:09] itself
[16:10] he the greatest of all that's what made
[16:12] him king that's what made him god that
[16:14] he could come down in such a form a
[16:16] human flesh
[16:17] like you and me take on a form that is
[16:21] filthy in the eyes of god like we would
[16:23] like we would say who would want to be a
[16:24] cockroach right
[16:26] i wouldn't want to be a cockroach that's
[16:28] a nasty little thing but
[16:29] god is so much higher you can imagine
[16:31] billion times the difference between
[16:33] that
[16:34] and what we are in the eyes of god he
[16:36] said i love them so much
[16:38] i want to come and live amongst them
[16:40] because if i don't
[16:42] they're lost and i've got to come so
[16:44] that i can redeem them back unto me
[16:47] and i started thinking of this you know
[16:48] and there's not a one of us that doesn't
[16:50] understand the effects of divine love
[16:52] and a couple months ago you know i i got
[16:54] a little bit down we all get down we go
[16:56] through things right
[16:57] and i'm a little bit melancholy in my
[16:59] nature so i have my highs and i have my
[17:00] lows
[17:01] but i was just really down and i'll tell
[17:02] you what got me there was i thought you
[17:04] know how many times i've now
[17:06] flown oh across the other side of the
[17:09] world now maybe four times
[17:10] and i've i got to thinking you know all
[17:12] the people i've witnessed to
[17:14] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[17:16] people and i started looking i said
[17:18] where's the effects of it
[17:20] so many people they just disregard the
[17:23] truth
[17:24] like i tell them and i tell them with
[17:25] everything that's in me the sincerity
[17:27] and
[17:28] love that i have and it you can tell
[17:30] it's just cold
[17:32] it doesn't have the effect it just and
[17:34] it just
[17:35] did something to me it made me just kind
[17:37] of want to pull back
[17:38] it made me start losing my feeling for
[17:40] people and i don't want to lose my
[17:42] feeling for people
[17:43] because i know the love that i have
[17:45] toward god is starting to wax cold
[17:47] when i start to lose my love for people
[17:50] and i want to pull away from people
[17:52] because he said if you say you love god
[17:54] whom you can't see
[17:56] and you can see the ones you're walking
[17:58] with and you don't love them you're
[17:59] deceived
[18:00] you don't actually love god you're doing
[18:03] it for some other
[18:04] reason you're doing it for some other
[18:06] motive i don't come here to preach
[18:08] because i want a name
[18:08] i could care less i don't even want to
[18:11] be called a preacher i almost would
[18:12] rather just
[18:13] mess up my words just put it in such a
[18:15] way that you'll never
[18:16] recognize and exalt kyle i'm not worthy
[18:19] to be exalted there's none good amongst
[18:21] us only god
[18:22] and so when i get to thinking of those
[18:24] things and i just start to think you
[18:26] know i start getting down i was like
[18:27] lord with everything in me i'm trying
[18:29] i'm doing everything i can
[18:31] my family those that i love you love
[18:33] them so much it just tears you to pieces
[18:35] you don't even know you've done
[18:36] you've what more can you do you've
[18:39] shared it you've broken it down in so
[18:41] many ways
[18:42] it just gets you to a point you just get
[18:43] so discouraged
[18:45] and they get more cold towards you they
[18:48] get
[18:48] less and you can see i i know men that
[18:51] i've sat and prayed with
[18:52] that had major problems and god come
[18:54] down and supernaturally
[18:56] change the scene for them so much so
[18:57] they'll come and they're not even
[18:58] believers come back and say
[19:00] right there when you pray and i said and
[19:03] yet you won't
[19:04] listen god vindicates his truth and
[19:07] confirms his word with signs wandering
[19:10] and you get colder with time and it gets
[19:13] you just
[19:14] feeling funny you know people getting
[19:16] just
[19:17] colder and more indifferent towards the
[19:19] things of god
[19:21] you know and it's one thing for the
[19:22] world but i don't ever want to see that
[19:24] amongst us
[19:25] i don't want to see us get cold i don't
[19:27] want because the iniquity does abound in
[19:29] the land
[19:30] the love of many begins to wax cold
[19:33] i don't want to ever see that i don't
[19:35] want this to become tradition
[19:37] i don't want us to say well i'm looking
[19:39] for something else to really get me
[19:40] juiced up and so i can really
[19:42] no i want the people
[19:45] i want the people moved by revelation
[19:47] and the love of god that they recognize
[19:49] so clearly you know as the words opening
[19:51] up
[19:52] we're beginning to recognize it's it's
[19:54] not just to
[19:56] enlighten you it's not just to enlighten
[19:59] you
[19:59] though it does the word being broken
[20:02] it starts to show you who you are and
[20:04] you start to be able to identify
[20:06] with all those bible characters brother
[20:07] branham says
[20:09] you can say hey i was back there with
[20:10] abraham you know i had to separate from
[20:13] my family
[20:14] i had to separate from those that i love
[20:16] so that i could walk with him
[20:17] you start taking all the way down
[20:19] through that journey you start to
[20:20] realize
[20:20] well what portion of the bible am i not
[20:22] fulfilling
[20:25] it's the whole mystery of god that's why
[20:27] you can take christ in you
[20:28] is the hope of glory and bring it back
[20:30] into christ as the mystery of god
[20:32] revealed and say i'm going to use the
[20:33] whole bible
[20:34] and then you can go back and say what
[20:37] what character
[20:38] am i not identified with i'm identified
[20:41] in all of it
[20:43] every bit of it i'm identified with it
[20:46] and it does something to you and it
[20:47] changes
[20:48] you and revelation changes you it
[20:50] changes the way you think it
[20:52] changes the way you act it changes your
[20:54] response in the situation that you find
[20:56] yourself in
[20:57] what temptation what trial can come your
[21:00] way after you know who you are
[21:02] and you know what god has done for you
[21:04] and you know the sovereign grace of god
[21:07] saw you came your way rescued you
[21:10] how does that not cause you to act
[21:12] different in the midst of a trial
[21:14] it changes you it just does something
[21:17] it's no longer him that will it for him
[21:18] that run it
[21:19] it's no longer how long how well can i
[21:22] line it up
[21:23] it's not something else takes over from
[21:25] there brother brown said the holy ghost
[21:27] in you
[21:27] isn't something you do but it's a life
[21:29] that he lives through you
[21:31] doesn't come it's not a sensation it's
[21:32] not something i'm producing
[21:34] something takes place something moves
[21:37] and i remember you know i've walked with
[21:39] you here for a while and i'm sorry i'm
[21:40] gonna go memory lane for a moment
[21:43] but it helps to build my context and i
[21:46] i got to think you know it was ten years
[21:48] ago right i wandered back here
[21:51] and brother bob you remember you're the
[21:53] first person i talked to right and
[21:55] before we got baptized and and i i said
[21:57] now
[21:58] i sat back in there i said wow there's
[22:00] something interesting about here
[22:02] i just knew god had led me here you know
[22:04] and
[22:05] and god did some major things i'd come
[22:08] in contact with
[22:09] brother branham and that oh hi brother
[22:11] harry i just saw you back there
[22:12] god bless you brother sorry that makes
[22:14] me hello
[22:17] i don't think you can see that's okay
[22:19] but you know i got to thinking about
[22:20] that i says
[22:22] lord you brought me here you set me here
[22:24] amongst these people sovereignly i
[22:26] wasn't even looking for you
[22:28] but i saw something real and some tapes
[22:30] one day
[22:31] though nobody i could never come in
[22:33] contact with anybody that told me this
[22:34] was the truth
[22:35] but there was some deep down on that
[22:37] inside that could say that ain't nothing
[22:39] but the truth
[22:42] who put that there why is that there
[22:47] something did that i love my mom but she
[22:50] never knew that
[22:51] she didn't tell me this is the truth
[22:53] walk you in it
[22:54] i would have loved it i think she would
[22:56] have too if we would have known these
[22:57] things at a younger age it would have
[22:58] spared us a lot of heartache and trouble
[23:00] but that wasn't the plan of god for my
[23:02] life right
[23:04] but he did something there and he
[23:06] brought me amongst the people
[23:08] and then as i was sitting there you know
[23:11] uh
[23:11] it's always embarrassing to say but i i
[23:13] was i drank myself to sleep every night
[23:16] always kind of nervous you know nervous
[23:18] nature they can't
[23:20] calm down and for me it's embarrassing
[23:23] but it's just truth i was thirsting for
[23:25] something
[23:26] alcohol can never satisfy and when i
[23:28] finally got my thirst satisfied
[23:30] had no need for alcohol see we try to
[23:33] fill it with so many things
[23:35] job work some other sensation some other
[23:38] earthly sensation to satisfy
[23:41] telling you you're running an empty road
[23:42] it's a dead end road you'll never get
[23:44] there
[23:44] you're still running it's a treadmill it
[23:46] never comes unplugged from the wall
[23:48] you're you're gonna run and run and run
[23:50] but when i hit something real
[23:54] that thirst versus anything other than
[23:56] him it just faded away
[23:57] had a whole box of cigars said don't
[23:59] need these no more threw them away
[24:01] had a whole separate refrigerator for
[24:02] beer i told you i ain't here to exalt
[24:05] myself
[24:05] i'd rather abase myself for your sake
[24:09] right i had no more need for any of it
[24:11] it just disappeared
[24:13] all gone went out in my driveway just
[24:15] started i was pouring for a while guys
[24:16] i'd be honest with you
[24:17] i just sitting there pouring it all out
[24:18] i had no need for it i found what i was
[24:20] looking for
[24:21] all these years i found what i was
[24:23] looking for i finally
[24:25] found it i'd been looking for it i
[24:26] remember going outside as a kid you know
[24:28] 10 12 years old
[24:29] i'd go out there and look at those stars
[24:30] and i knew something was calling out to
[24:32] me
[24:33] i can't make that up and before god he
[24:35] knows i'm telling the truth
[24:36] i would never tell i wouldn't i wouldn't
[24:37] just say that i'd go out there in those
[24:39] stars and i'd say
[24:40] i know you're out there i just don't
[24:42] know where
[24:43] i know he's out there i just don't know
[24:45] where that deep calling
[24:47] deep calling to the d i remember going
[24:49] into a bar
[24:50] and i couldn't have fun ever been there
[24:55] out in the world you're trying to run
[24:56] from the presence of god and you can't
[24:58] even enjoy it no more you're just
[25:00] running running running
[25:02] and he talked to me in the bar he did
[25:05] yeah before god he did he came in i said
[25:08] what are you doing here
[25:09] i was like oh lord i just wanna leave me
[25:13] alone i remember saying
[25:14] that leave me alone he wouldn't leave me
[25:16] alone i'm so glad he didn't
[25:18] he drove me out of there and he drove me
[25:20] out of there and i pulled into my
[25:21] driveway and there i saw an old cd of
[25:23] brother branham that i had
[25:25] couldn't understand it put it all away
[25:26] for five years i put it all away
[25:28] wouldn't even listen to a sermon stop
[25:30] going to church wouldn't talk about god
[25:32] because i couldn't understand it
[25:33] couldn't figure it out couldn't find my
[25:35] place couldn't understand any of it
[25:37] then i saw that and i think i remember
[25:39] telling you i took that cd and i threw
[25:40] it as hard as i could because it made me
[25:42] angry
[25:43] and then never i knew i grieved i mean
[25:46] something hit me
[25:47] it sobered me up instantly i'll tell you
[25:49] that and i knew something was different
[25:52] but i found something real and i had
[25:55] found something real though i was trying
[25:56] to run from and i found something real
[25:58] and i remember saying right there in my
[26:00] pickup truck i said lord
[26:01] um i've been trying to find you and i
[26:04] can't find you
[26:06] what is going on what do i do i said
[26:08] that little prayer and then things
[26:10] started changing
[26:12] life started changing for me friendship
[26:13] started changing for me
[26:15] i started finding myself associating
[26:17] with different people and they wanted to
[26:18] have bible studies
[26:20] and those same people they wanted to
[26:21] have bible say i said well i got nothing
[26:23] to say i've been reading my bible
[26:25] but you know i'll go listen to one of
[26:26] them cds again brother branham
[26:28] now i'll take it maybe share it with
[26:30] them maybe it'll help them maybe they'll
[26:31] understand because i don't understand it
[26:33] you know and boom something happens
[26:36] you know i don't think those things are
[26:38] accident
[26:39] i don't think those things just happen i
[26:42] don't think that
[26:44] as we start going in there and if
[26:45] something stirs up inside of me that i i
[26:47] start to go and i
[26:48] i go over to uh um a
[26:52] computer you know and i google search
[26:53] because i said i got to get baptized
[26:55] and i water water baptist name lord
[26:57] jesus christ and the global answer pops
[26:58] up at brother lonnie
[27:00] and i listened to it and i said whoa
[27:01] looky here there's people in lima ohio i
[27:03] think believe this truth
[27:06] i don't think that's an accident i think
[27:08] that was the love of god calling out
[27:11] and it just led me here i called my
[27:13] grandpa i said i'm
[27:14] i'm a little bit nervous what kind of
[27:16] people these are
[27:18] you go with me and i sit back there in
[27:19] the back and i i sit you know when i
[27:22] see the reverence of the sanctuary it's
[27:24] the first thing that struck me
[27:26] first thing that struck me was the
[27:27] quietness in the sanctuary
[27:30] people that recognized they were they
[27:32] weren't just plain church they're coming
[27:34] before the
[27:35] almighty god and i know we could point
[27:37] and say there's lots of things
[27:38] but i'll tell you god still led me here
[27:42] yeah he sure did and then the second
[27:44] thing i saw
[27:45] was a little girl walking down the aisle
[27:47] long hair and a little dress
[27:50] it was just melting me i'm a man i had a
[27:53] refrigerator full of beer living a
[27:55] sinful light and i'm falling to pieces
[27:57] in the presence of something real
[28:00] i'm i'm busting up and then i had
[28:03] brother doyle in the back there gives me
[28:05] a hug
[28:06] says god bless you and i've been around
[28:09] church my whole life i've been around
[28:11] pentecostal churches and big churches
[28:12] and i always say god bless you you know
[28:14] i'm blessed of god highly favored they
[28:15] go on for about two minutes you know
[28:17] tell you everything they are
[28:18] you know they would you've been there
[28:20] you've seen individuals just a religious
[28:22] spirit
[28:23] it ain't genuine there's nothing real
[28:25] about that
[28:26] and i knew there was nothing real about
[28:28] that's why i didn't like it
[28:30] i just say hi you know
[28:33] i don't like that i never liked that but
[28:36] then brother duo
[28:37] god bless you gives me a hug and i'm not
[28:39] a hugger
[28:40] i wasn't a hugger you know
[28:44] but i knew that was real and that
[28:47] something real
[28:48] just got me and it wasn't i wasn't
[28:51] i it wasn't that i was putting it all
[28:53] together now listen i told you i
[28:55] listened brother
[28:56] i didn't have a clue where he stole mom
[28:58] daniel 70 weeks
[28:59] future home of heaven i got no clue but
[29:01] something's real in there
[29:03] then i come and i see something real in
[29:05] the people
[29:06] and that something real starts doing
[29:07] something to me
[29:09] and then my wife you know we never raced
[29:11] with we didn't know what dress was we
[29:13] my wife didn't uh own a dress maybe she
[29:15] owned a dress for for some occasion but
[29:17] we never wore dresses
[29:18] we the god of this evil eyege had
[29:20] blinded us totally blinded us
[29:22] to what modesty was we didn't know what
[29:25] it was
[29:26] we had no clue what it was go to church
[29:29] here and then
[29:30] carrie calls me a few days after we're
[29:32] baptized and she says you know
[29:33] honey um you really believe that's true
[29:38] i said yeah i do she says you really
[29:40] believe like a girl should dress in mona
[29:42] sparrow
[29:43] i said yeah i do i see that
[29:46] i know that's the truth and my wife you
[29:49] know what she says to me
[29:50] she says i just don't know if i see that
[29:54] and you know i tell you this the first
[29:55] time i remember when it hit me because i
[29:57] was in the truck
[29:58] i knew something came over me you know i
[30:01] could have taken one path i could say
[30:03] hey
[30:03] you're my wife i'm gonna tell you right
[30:05] now you're gonna be married to me
[30:07] you're going to line up and do what i
[30:09] say because you're not going to
[30:10] disrespect me and make me
[30:11] look bad didn't say that it's the first
[30:14] time i could promise you before god
[30:16] something came in that car
[30:19] took me over i said i love you no matter
[30:21] what
[30:22] i love you no matter what it says you go
[30:25] as you feel led of the lord
[30:27] i love you i can't compromise i still
[30:30] believe that's
[30:30] truth and you know what happened
[30:34] i think i've told you the story she
[30:36] began to pray about it
[30:37] she put all of her clothes pants and
[30:39] garbage bags and then
[30:41] i was a good husband i took the trash
[30:43] out one day
[30:44] not knowing that that was her clothes
[30:47] but god just spoke to her and it was
[30:49] from that moment she says see god won't
[30:51] let me turn back
[30:52] he loves me too much he won't let me
[30:53] turn back and i think it was a week
[30:55] later she caught that revelation for
[30:57] herself
[30:58] right but what would have happened if i
[31:00] would have taken a different nature
[31:03] do you think that that portion of the
[31:05] word could have been unlocked
[31:07] for my wife because only the lamb can
[31:10] take the book
[31:12] only the lamb can loose the seals only
[31:14] the lamb can make the book live
[31:17] it's the only way and i and i started to
[31:19] see i said so what what is this
[31:21] i'd never seen anything like it what was
[31:23] it that could make a man that drank
[31:24] himself to sleep every night
[31:27] have no more thirst for it the next day
[31:30] what was it that a
[31:31] a a a a a a good girl my wife's a
[31:34] was always a good girl but she was never
[31:36] raised with that truth in a day
[31:38] turn back and never look from it again
[31:40] never no desire for makeup no more
[31:42] desire to cut hair no more desire for
[31:44] those things
[31:45] what does that divine love
[31:49] the divine love of god to me
[31:52] conquered me and that as it conquered me
[31:56] i started taking dominion of everything
[31:59] around me but not by force
[32:02] not with the wolf nature and by love
[32:05] a lamb started taking the book and
[32:07] loosing the seals
[32:09] making the book live you know it's one
[32:11] thing to say
[32:12] the bride over there she's going to do a
[32:14] great mighty work
[32:15] that's wonderful and i believe that but
[32:17] it's totally different when it says
[32:21] this bride right here this bride right
[32:24] here is going to take
[32:24] the book and lose the seals it's one
[32:27] thing to say john
[32:28] takes the book it's another thing to say
[32:29] brother brian take the book
[32:32] sister virginia take the book right
[32:35] it's so much different everything
[32:37] changes when it becomes personal
[32:39] everything does and this is what all
[32:41] hell is against
[32:43] let them feel comfortable and feel a
[32:44] part of the group then we're not
[32:46] threatened the devil thinks that
[32:48] but you know when he becomes threatened
[32:50] when you actually go and take the book
[32:53] when you as an individual say you know
[32:55] what this entire thing was for me
[32:59] i don't know if it was for everybody
[33:01] else but i do know this
[33:03] that message is for me i know
[33:06] that that life was for me
[33:09] that's my redemptive rights i have
[33:13] rights and those are my rights and i'm
[33:15] here to take back my rights
[33:18] i do not believe that this body has to
[33:19] rule me
[33:22] it might have in years gone past it
[33:25] might have
[33:26] but not no more no the person of the
[33:29] word is here to enforce redemption's
[33:30] rights and i want him to first enforce
[33:32] it
[33:32] on this earth right here this is the
[33:35] ground that i want enforced
[33:36] right here i don't believe this is
[33:39] something we talk about with a hope so
[33:41] i think this was used to be a prophecy i
[33:43] don't think it's prophecy anymore
[33:45] i think it's history for the bride of
[33:46] jesus christ i don't believe that we
[33:49] have to be dictated and ran by our human
[33:51] emotions and feelings and
[33:53] none of it any longer i don't believe
[33:54] that i've seen too much of the word
[33:55] being revealed
[33:56] i just can't i can't look at anything
[33:59] that way anymore
[34:00] i saw an open door and i'm leaving i saw
[34:03] an open door in heaven i was walking
[34:05] where in lay the sea i was bound to this
[34:07] thing
[34:07] but i saw a spirit i saw i was a
[34:09] spiritual king
[34:10] a spiritual king has dominion i saw i'm
[34:13] a spiritual priest i have the ability to
[34:15] intercede
[34:16] i'm a king and priest already with god
[34:18] and the judge is my attorney
[34:21] he's the lion and the lamb and the judge
[34:22] has become my attorney
[34:24] to enforce my redemptions rights
[34:28] something's totally different
[34:32] maybe we should look at notes
[34:36] so
[34:39] so there was there was a little so we'll
[34:42] just take this angle for a minute
[34:44] there's a little uh a mighty warrior on
[34:47] my front porch
[34:48] right now kids will know what i'm
[34:49] talking about
[34:51] and the front porch of my house has been
[34:53] taken over it's been
[34:55] been taken under the domain of a fierce
[34:57] animal
[34:58] about that size a little birdie
[35:02] about three inch little bird and
[35:06] every time we go out there it will run
[35:07] you off the porch
[35:09] i have three cats and they're scared of
[35:11] that thing
[35:13] and it's that big like i could just
[35:16] pop it it's a little bird
[35:20] and it has completely taken over our
[35:23] front porch nobody goes out there
[35:25] my wife i like sitting on our front
[35:26] porch and i won't go out there right now
[35:28] i'm afraid of that thing but you know
[35:31] why that bird's so crazy
[35:33] there's a little nest of little babies
[35:37] there on my porch a little nest inside
[35:39] that little nest i saw little beaks and
[35:40] little heads back there
[35:42] that little thing it's like a
[35:44] pterodactyl on our front porch
[35:47] it's become fierce
[35:51] bold as a lion
[35:54] i mean it will not let anything
[35:58] get on that front porch because of love
[36:03] love loves doing something
[36:06] that i'm not even messing with the bird
[36:08] my cats aren't messing with the bird
[36:11] and it's love for those little baby
[36:13] birds
[36:15] now we're now that's a that's an animal
[36:18] that's a
[36:19] that's a mammal and it's causing that
[36:21] bird to do things i never thought a
[36:23] little tiny birdie would do
[36:25] i could see it maybe from a crow or
[36:27] something like that this had like a
[36:28] little finch
[36:30] run you off the front porch but it's
[36:33] that love that it has that's causing it
[36:35] to do things that it never even probably
[36:36] thought it could do
[36:38] it's conquering because it was conquered
[36:42] it was conquered by the love of those
[36:43] little babies in that nest
[36:45] because it was conquered by that love
[36:47] now it's conquering anything
[36:48] that should threaten it or that's babies
[36:53] and brother branham says this and
[36:57] god projecting his love he said love is
[37:00] a powerful force
[37:02] it'll run a woman a mother right into
[37:04] the flames of fire after her baby
[37:06] if she knows she is even plunging
[37:07] herself to death there's nothing more
[37:10] strong than love
[37:11] love will make you trust you might go
[37:14] and know that you're
[37:15] you belong to the greatest church in all
[37:17] the provinces of canada
[37:18] canada you might know that you're a
[37:21] charter member of even the greatest
[37:23] church in the nation
[37:24] and then you would go out and do things
[37:26] that you would not do if you belong to a
[37:28] little mission somewhere on a corner
[37:30] and had the love of god in your heart
[37:33] love has no fear
[37:35] love casts out fear and i noticed in my
[37:38] meeting
[37:38] so much that when i come into the people
[37:41] one of the great things i find among
[37:43] them is fear
[37:45] and what makes fear is a lack of
[37:47] confidence
[37:49] if you lack confidence it will make you
[37:51] fear
[37:52] but if if you love it'll cast away fear
[37:56] and that's the way that god wants his
[37:57] church not so many in sense of a charter
[38:00] member
[38:01] but he wants members that are loyal and
[38:03] loves him and believes him and has
[38:05] confidence in him
[38:08] and that's exactly what creates that
[38:09] confidence in that little birdie
[38:11] was love it wasn't looking at the
[38:14] strength of its beak
[38:16] it's barely got one it was looking at
[38:19] something that actually makes that thing
[38:21] almost invincible to cats and
[38:23] humans now if that's the love of a
[38:26] little birdie what about the love of god
[38:29] that's been manifested in the people
[38:32] makes you bold as lions when the kids
[38:35] had wrote a question
[38:36] i'd ask them write some questions i'd
[38:38] like to get a feel for where where the
[38:39] youth are
[38:40] one of the questions and i thought it
[38:41] was a tremendous question i think any of
[38:43] us could probably
[38:44] or have asked this question what can i
[38:46] do to overcome temptation
[38:48] that's a good question yeah right
[38:51] what can i do to overcome it you know
[38:54] what you do
[38:55] you love the lord
[38:58] you love the lord with all your heart
[39:00] your soul and your mind and you really
[39:01] do
[39:02] you watch it'll conquer every trial
[39:05] every temptation every difficulty that
[39:07] comes your way
[39:08] i've seen it happen i know it's happened
[39:11] you let a little issue come in your home
[39:13] between husband and wife
[39:15] you get real humble real quiet and you
[39:18] take dominion and by divine love start
[39:20] to project that
[39:21] watch what happens the sovereign grace
[39:23] comes in and solves the problem
[39:25] that you and your great intellect just
[39:26] couldn't figure out
[39:29] just couldn't figure out you know our
[39:31] strength comes in our weakness and our
[39:33] utter dependence upon him to fight every
[39:35] battle that we have
[39:37] for your kids it's the same way can't
[39:39] seem to get my kids you know what you do
[39:41] love them
[39:44] really love them watch what happens i've
[39:47] seen it happen from my home
[39:49] you know it's the truth you know so many
[39:51] times you wear yourself out
[39:53] you wear yourself out and you give up
[39:56] sometimes
[39:57] all because you won't do what he told
[39:59] you to do
[40:01] you really create the atmosphere you
[40:02] love him remember what was the cross
[40:05] take up your cross daily it was when two
[40:07] maze ways met
[40:08] your ways and his ways our ways wear us
[40:11] out
[40:12] complicate the situation and make it
[40:14] worse you take his way one time
[40:17] you really do from your heart you
[40:18] remember what he did for you
[40:20] you remember the great price he paid for
[40:22] you you remember
[40:24] you unworthy individual remember the
[40:26] little
[40:27] girl with the flag she began to wave her
[40:29] flag and she was in the corner crying
[40:31] because she saw the king but the king
[40:33] never saw her
[40:35] you can't say that i can't say that
[40:39] i can't say the king never saw me i can
[40:42] say this
[40:43] i didn't even see the king but the king
[40:45] saw me
[40:46] the king saw me and he sought me out and
[40:49] he made
[40:50] me his talk about the love of god
[40:54] why would the king of kings the lord of
[40:57] lords
[40:58] that mighty conqueror want to come
[41:00] conquer me
[41:02] it was his love love me too much to let
[41:05] me slip
[41:06] through just love me too much
[41:09] and we've seen this and these are things
[41:11] i'm just bringing back to remembrance
[41:12] but
[41:14] brother branham talks about conquering
[41:16] those bulls
[41:17] i don't think those are just little
[41:18] stories i don't think those are things
[41:20] just for the prophet
[41:22] i don't think that was just for him
[41:23] that's the reality of things we're
[41:25] realizing
[41:26] this thing is moving from the prophet to
[41:28] the prophecy
[41:29] and i'm looking at the prophecy
[41:33] that the god of peace shall brew satan
[41:34] under your feet
[41:37] and he conquered the bulls by that love
[41:39] said i'm sorry little fellows i i
[41:40] shouldn't have been in your area
[41:42] and it just stopped a raging bull
[41:46] the hornets you all know these stories
[41:48] an upset wife and
[41:50] upset children fussing and arguing in
[41:52] the house brother braham said to come in
[41:54] and take dominion over it
[41:56] and he did it by divine love you know
[41:59] what he did he picked up a washrag i
[42:00] think it was
[42:01] sorry brothers you gotta do the dishes
[42:04] picked up a wash right just started to
[42:06] help his wife with the problems
[42:08] and it broke the atmosphere it drove
[42:10] that whatever evil spirit it was that
[42:12] was tearing up his wife
[42:14] tearing up his kids causing a problem in
[42:16] the home
[42:17] he just picked up a washrag said lord
[42:19] help me he could sympathize with her he
[42:22] could realize her pain
[42:23] struggle difficult day and it changed
[42:26] the scene
[42:28] remember old lizard eyes bert
[42:32] now you think of this here is the
[42:34] prophet to the age
[42:36] hunting with bert all the time
[42:38] witnessing to him
[42:41] sharing with him the word and that
[42:44] didn't move him
[42:45] that's amazing to me i'll be honest with
[42:47] you but it did sow a seed
[42:51] and it sewed a seed to where the right
[42:52] time when burnt
[42:54] little lizard eyes could see a mama deer
[42:57] come out of
[42:58] the woods because it hurt a little baby
[43:00] deer that was in trouble
[43:01] show her true colors and show something
[43:03] real something
[43:04] a real love expressed in a mother dear
[43:07] he says now you lead me back to that
[43:08] jesus
[43:10] and i just wonder this is just me maybe
[43:13] those seeds have been planted
[43:15] this is me you know brother bran no
[43:17] doubt was praying for bert he loved
[43:19] burke he really did
[43:21] and he sowed those seeds and sowed the
[43:23] seeds maybe he had been
[43:24] praying for for bert lord get a hold of
[43:27] him get a hold of him
[43:28] and god had a plan he was going to show
[43:31] the love of a mother
[43:33] he was going to show bert something real
[43:35] one day
[43:36] and then all those things that brother
[43:38] branham had talked to him about
[43:39] became a living reality when he saw
[43:42] divine love or a love expressed
[43:44] in a deer so that gave me an
[43:47] encouragement when i get to thinking of
[43:49] these things and i think
[43:50] how many words have i spoken that it
[43:52] feels like i've got i see nothing as a
[43:54] result but
[43:54] i have a promise those words won't
[43:56] return to him void it accomplishes his
[43:58] purpose
[44:00] but now maybe maybe the words went forth
[44:02] and so many messages have been preached
[44:04] and there's so many living epistles
[44:05] that's been expressed
[44:07] and god's just waiting for that perfect
[44:09] divine love to really start to manifest
[44:11] and project through you
[44:13] express it through you and maybe that'll
[44:16] be the thing
[44:16] that'll quicken that seed to life i
[44:19] don't know
[44:21] but i've seen it have it its effects
[44:22] before i saw it have an effect on bert
[44:25] old lizard eyes and i'm believing it'll
[44:26] do the same for some people that i've
[44:28] witnessed to
[44:29] and i've sowed a seed with i'm trusting
[44:31] that will
[44:33] brother branham says it conquers every
[44:35] sickness and every disease
[44:37] love he said show love one time
[44:40] have someone all nervous just express a
[44:42] little love to them
[44:44] can drive away an evil spirit maybe
[44:46] haunting them
[44:47] tearing them up i've had that for me god
[44:50] laid me on a heart of a brother
[44:52] i was in a just in just down just sad it
[44:55] came to me
[44:56] starts telling me that scripture you
[44:57] know god heals through love just show a
[44:59] little concern for somebody sometime
[45:01] god will heal them through it and it did
[45:03] struck me so straight
[45:05] because i realized you know god was
[45:06] mindful of me sent someone my path just
[45:08] to say i love you
[45:10] this will tell you i love you and it
[45:11] just broke me out of it
[45:13] just snapped me right back too he didn't
[45:16] come down and
[45:18] just hit me with the word upside the
[45:19] head don't you see who you are no
[45:21] just loved me for a little bit you ever
[45:23] have that
[45:24] you'd be all frustrated a wife could be
[45:26] upset you know
[45:28] my wife be upset she just won't sit and
[45:30] talk to me i talked to her for a little
[45:31] bit it's all gone
[45:33] because i cared for her and i loved her
[45:35] and brother branham said every sickness
[45:36] and disease
[45:37] conquered by divine love just conquered
[45:40] it
[45:42] but the greatest thing of all those
[45:43] things that was conquered was brother
[45:44] branham himself
[45:46] he said i'm my worst enemy he said
[45:49] divine love conquered me
[45:52] and when that divine love could conquer
[45:53] brother branham it was a tremendous
[45:55] victory in the love divine
[45:57] because it showed what brought this one
[45:59] to full harvest maturity is going to
[46:01] bring the rest of them
[46:02] to full harvest maturity the same life
[46:06] see for me everything admit you call me
[46:08] fanatic if you want
[46:10] but i want everything that that was
[46:12] there i'm elijah
[46:15] i'm elijah that's grabbing that mantle
[46:17] and saying hey the god of elijah
[46:20] i sure enjoyed listening to it i sure
[46:22] enjoyed seeing it manifested in my
[46:24] prophet
[46:25] but i'm wanting to see it manifested
[46:26] right here
[46:28] i'm waiting to see the god of elijah and
[46:30] i'm not passively sitting by as a
[46:31] bystander
[46:33] you could call me crazy if you want to
[46:34] but i've seen him do too many things
[46:36] already in my life
[46:37] i've seen him come by my way i've seen
[46:38] him do supernatural things time and time
[46:40] again
[46:41] and i guess it's just created a love and
[46:44] a faith
[46:44] that every promise was for me
[46:47] may not be for others that's individual
[46:50] that's up to you
[46:51] i believe it is but that's up to you but
[46:53] i'll tell you one thing
[46:54] it's for me that whole thing's for me
[46:57] that whole message was for me
[46:59] that divine love expressed it's coming
[47:01] from me
[47:03] this is totally different when you put
[47:04] yourself in the picture i'll read you
[47:07] something i'm gonna drop down here into
[47:08] my notes
[47:10] how many remember the story of brother
[47:12] branham i hope this okay i'm just really
[47:14] relaxed and just
[47:15] doing something different here i had
[47:18] short notice
[47:28] you remember the story of the old
[47:31] fisherman
[47:33] uh old captain of the sea i'm gonna have
[47:37] to
[47:37] paraphrase it here i can't find it in my
[47:39] nose
[47:42] oh here it is he said there was an old
[47:44] captain on the sea one time he's pretty
[47:46] much near lived out his whole life in
[47:48] sin
[47:48] but once he heard of and once once he
[47:52] had heard of a bible and of god and he
[47:54] was laying dying he said
[47:55] is there one person that could talk to
[47:57] me about the bible
[47:59] he said is there a bible anywhere on
[48:00] this ship he'd waited a long time to
[48:03] think about that but god was full of
[48:04] mercy and grace
[48:05] they found a boy there and and they that
[48:08] he had picked up on the ship and he had
[48:10] a bible
[48:11] and he told him he said come in son and
[48:13] he set him down on his bed
[48:14] he said you read me that bible and the
[48:16] young man turned to isaiah 53
[48:18] 5 and it reads like this he was wounded
[48:21] for our transgressions
[48:23] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[48:25] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[48:28] and with his stripes we were healed the
[48:31] little boy turned
[48:32] and said to the captain captain sir he
[48:35] said yes lad
[48:36] he said let me read it to you the way my
[48:37] mama used to read it to me
[48:40] said read on he said but here's the way
[48:43] mama used to read it to me
[48:44] he said go ahead son he said mama used
[48:47] to set me up on her lap
[48:49] and read it he was wounded for willie
[48:52] pruitt
[48:53] he was bruised for willy pruitt's
[48:55] iniquity
[48:56] the chastisement of willy pruitt's peace
[48:58] was upon him
[48:59] and with his stripes willie pruitt was
[49:02] healed
[49:03] the old captain said oh i wish i had a
[49:05] mama that could read it to me like that
[49:07] said maybe my name could be read into it
[49:10] like that
[49:11] the little boy said well just a minute
[49:13] captain let's read your name in it
[49:16] he was wounded for john quartz's
[49:18] salvation
[49:19] he was bruised for john quartz's
[49:21] iniquity and the chastisement of john's
[49:24] corpses
[49:24] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[49:27] john quartz was healed
[49:29] the light flashed over the captain's
[49:31] face and he said close the book son
[49:33] i see it and when you can read your name
[49:36] in there
[49:36] he was wounded for william branham's
[49:38] transgressions
[49:39] he was bruised for william branham's
[49:41] iniquities then the peace comes
[49:44] and the that see it's not just a
[49:46] wholesale affair
[49:48] then it's for me it's an individual and
[49:51] i'm included in it
[49:52] you see with his stripes william branham
[49:54] is healed then it's
[49:56] all different it's all
[49:59] different when it's individual
[50:02] when it becomes personal brother bam
[50:05] says in christ in mystery it's not
[50:07] individual
[50:08] it's one person and all hell's against
[50:09] that teaching all hell's against this
[50:11] truth but it's truth
[50:13] it's to him personally i say unto thee
[50:17] he says not to them but to thee see not
[50:20] one hair
[50:21] of your head will perish you are mine i
[50:24] will raise you up in the last day and
[50:26] give you eternal life
[50:28] and raise him up in the last days there
[50:30] it is you see
[50:31] it's a revelation to the individual not
[50:33] to the group
[50:34] all hell's against it totally different
[50:37] when you read this open book with your
[50:39] name in it
[50:41] we're seeing the bride in so many
[50:43] portions of the scripture but now it's
[50:44] got to become
[50:46] individual we speak of the bride as a
[50:49] group i'm speaking as a bride as an
[50:50] individual
[50:52] as individuals that city before me that
[50:53] i believe are a part of the bride of
[50:55] jesus christ
[50:56] the day as individuals have to take the
[50:58] book they have to be able to read their
[51:00] name in it
[51:00] to make the book live make it a living
[51:03] reality
[51:04] make it a truth manifested it has to be
[51:08] believed
[51:09] has to be taken by faith
[51:12] i want to look at some things here if
[51:14] it's okay
[51:16] everybody's comfortable right
[51:22] so brother branham says this jesus was
[51:26] completely totally man
[51:28] he could cry like a man he could eat
[51:30] like a man he could be tired just like a
[51:32] man
[51:33] he was completely and totally man in his
[51:35] physical being
[51:37] in his spirit he was completely and
[51:39] totally god
[51:41] and he made his flesh in submission to
[51:43] his spirit
[51:44] that was in him you see he was tempted
[51:47] in all manners like we
[51:49] he was a man not an angel he was a man
[51:52] he had desires and temptations just like
[51:55] we do
[51:56] the bible said that he did he was a man
[51:59] not above
[51:59] angels or above temptations hebrews 1 4
[52:03] said that he was made lower than the
[52:04] angels he was a man completely
[52:07] man that god took a complete
[52:10] man to bring total deliverance and he
[52:13] filled him with his spirit
[52:14] the holy ghost was in him without
[52:16] measure and he was tempted
[52:18] like we were and he was completely god
[52:21] he proved it when he could raise from
[52:23] the dead and stop nature
[52:24] and the roaring seas and the mighty
[52:26] winds when he spoke to the trees and so
[52:29] forth and they had to obey him
[52:30] he was god on the inside and he could
[52:33] have been a man
[52:34] for he was a man but he totally and
[52:37] completely delivered himself
[52:39] as a man into the hands of god for
[52:42] service
[52:43] and he is our example we are the men and
[52:46] women
[52:46] we are christians and he is our example
[52:50] let us completely deliver ourselves into
[52:52] the hands of the holy ghost
[52:54] that we might be the subjects of the
[52:56] kingdom of god see
[52:58] totally man but totally god but he
[53:01] surrendered his natural parts
[53:03] his physical parts even his own thinking
[53:06] his own
[53:06] doings his own cares and did only those
[53:09] things which please the father
[53:11] you see there it is total deliverance
[53:14] from human beings
[53:17] when i read that i put my name in there
[53:22] i know that this is a flesh that makes
[53:25] mistakes
[53:26] i know it and yet i know there's
[53:29] something that's got in there too
[53:31] i know it i know that brother chad is
[53:35] is a man he can make mistakes and i know
[53:38] that there's a god behind that man
[53:41] i'm not afraid of the voice i know
[53:44] there's a god in each and every one of
[53:45] you and there if i but you know what if
[53:46] you spend enough time with me
[53:48] you'd find out he's not perfect
[53:51] i might do something rub you wrong
[53:54] but i think divine love inside of you
[53:56] can look past my mistakes
[53:58] and say but i know god's there too you
[54:01] see
[54:01] we're not what we want to be but we are
[54:04] not what we used to be
[54:06] and that divine love is causing me to
[54:08] look beyond the mistakes of my brothers
[54:11] beyond the mistakes of i hope it's
[54:13] causing you to look beyond the mistakes
[54:14] of me
[54:15] and be able to recognize but yet behind
[54:17] that badger skin
[54:19] that old stinky badger skin there's a
[54:22] god manifesting
[54:25] and i trust that you're just like me
[54:27] you're bringing your human part
[54:28] subjected to his will
[54:30] you're bringing your mind in subjection
[54:32] you're bringing your life into
[54:34] subjection
[54:35] your desires are coming becoming his
[54:37] desires
[54:38] because that's what's happening with me
[54:40] because i realize i have a right to take
[54:42] that
[54:43] that book belongs to me redemptions
[54:46] rights and the life that's in that book
[54:47] is my rights
[54:49] i have a right to it
[54:52] i'll look at a couple things here if
[54:54] it's okay
[54:56] he said i was reading a story one time i
[54:58] don't look at this great king
[54:59] i think if you think about what he's
[55:01] done for you to change you
[55:03] i was reading a story some time ago of a
[55:04] great noble king i forgot his name
[55:07] i was thinking about the story and
[55:08] perhaps it's fiction but it leads us
[55:10] here to a point in a background
[55:12] of what i want to say and this is the
[55:14] mighty god unveiled
[55:15] this king he was such a noble king and a
[55:18] great lover of his subjects till one day
[55:20] before his guard and his royalty he said
[55:22] today you will see me for the last time
[55:24] for many years
[55:25] and his guards and his nobles all said
[55:27] to him oh good king why
[55:28] why do you say that are you going to a
[55:30] foreign country are you becoming an
[55:32] alien
[55:33] he said no i'm staying right here well i
[55:35] said i'm going out amongst my subjects
[55:38] i'm going to become a peasant i'm going
[55:40] to go cut wood with the wood chopper
[55:42] i'm going to go till the ground with the
[55:44] toiler i'm going to go prune the vines
[55:46] with those that prune the vines
[55:48] i'm going to go be one of them in order
[55:50] that i can be better acquainted with
[55:52] them and what they're doing
[55:53] i love them and i want to be acquainted
[55:56] with them personally
[55:57] they know they won't know me yet i'll be
[56:00] acquainted with them in that way
[56:03] the next morning when his delegates and
[56:04] all the people seen him
[56:06] or the ones that were in the palace he
[56:08] took off his crown
[56:09] and he laid it on a seat a throne he
[56:12] took off his robe
[56:13] and he put on peasants clothes and he
[56:15] walked out amongst common people
[56:18] now in this little story we find out
[56:20] then
[56:21] a little about god they said king we
[56:24] love you
[56:25] we we want you to remain here as king
[56:28] but he wanted to become one of them
[56:30] to know them better and that they may
[56:33] know him better
[56:34] really what he was it would display to
[56:37] them
[56:37] what he really was and that's what god
[56:40] did
[56:40] he changed himself he being jehovah god
[56:43] become
[56:44] one of us that he might suffer and taste
[56:46] death
[56:47] that he might know the sting of death
[56:50] and take the penalty of death upon
[56:52] himself
[56:52] he laid aside his crown and his robe and
[56:55] he became one of us
[56:57] he washed feet with the lowly he dwelt
[57:00] in the tents of the poor he slept in the
[57:03] woods and in the streets
[57:05] and those who were underprivileged he
[57:07] became one of them
[57:09] that he might understand them better and
[57:11] that we may understand him better
[57:13] he became one of us he became
[57:17] why would he become one of us why would
[57:19] he want to come and be identified with
[57:21] this old nasty peasant
[57:23] that's an amazing thing you know it's
[57:26] one thing to think
[57:27] he became in the likeness of flesh 2000
[57:30] years ago but why does he come
[57:32] and work amongst us today he was the
[57:34] firstborn of many brethren
[57:36] and he's veiled where and a mechanic
[57:40] and a steel worker a guy owns a business
[57:45] housewife at home he's walking in those
[57:48] footsteps
[57:49] wants to know you better want you to
[57:52] know him better you see
[57:55] you've got to put yourself in the story
[57:58] that's been the problem we were reading
[57:59] it wrong for too long
[58:01] we were reading it all in regards to the
[58:03] masculine version now we're reading it
[58:05] with its feminist tone
[58:07] recognizing the further portion of the
[58:09] word to be expressed
[58:12] and it's changing us
[58:16] brother bam says and we were sinners you
[58:19] see
[58:19] alienated from god and from the world
[58:21] and we were in a muck of the mud
[58:23] and as i talked to you this morning god
[58:25] came to you or came to us
[58:27] he sought out you you never sought out
[58:30] god
[58:31] no man comes to me except my father
[58:33] draws him he came down into the muck of
[58:35] that
[58:36] that what you were and he sought you out
[58:39] and he brought you out
[58:40] that ought to create a perfect love look
[58:44] what you was
[58:45] and now look what you are what did that
[58:48] somebody that loved you can't you have
[58:51] faith in what he's promised you then
[58:54] real genuine love will create a perfect
[58:57] confidence in his word
[59:06] hope's okay i just want to keep going i
[59:09] like these
[59:11] brother branham says this and this is
[59:13] this is amazing
[59:15] think of this in light of temptation
[59:17] okay
[59:18] now here in louisville not long ago
[59:20] there was a minister talking that was a
[59:22] there was a a young lady she waited a
[59:24] little long in life to be married
[59:26] somewhere up into her
[59:27] 25 30 years old she was a fine staunch
[59:29] christian girl
[59:30] and there was a certain man in
[59:31] louisville he he wasn't
[59:34] he had lived uh he hadn't lived a very
[59:36] good life he had run to dances and out
[59:38] to road houses and so forth
[59:40] but one day he found pardon for his sins
[59:42] and he became a real christian
[59:44] real staunch christian about a year
[59:46] later he fell in love with this young
[59:48] lady and the young lady
[59:50] lady madly fell in love with him and
[59:51] they were married and after they lived
[59:53] together for two years
[59:55] they said they said that this young lady
[59:58] said to her husband one day said dear i
[1:00:00] suppose that it's kind of hard for you
[1:00:02] just a new christian said i've been a
[1:00:04] christian since i was a little girl
[1:00:06] but said for you a young christian you
[1:00:09] have to stand
[1:00:10] all the whiles and temptations that goes
[1:00:12] after you
[1:00:14] after you've sinned so long and he said
[1:00:16] well it does become a great battle
[1:00:19] she said i want you to remember one
[1:00:20] thing that if the enemy does come in and
[1:00:24] upset you
[1:00:24] somewhere and you fall and you go back
[1:00:27] into sin
[1:00:28] don't you stay away from home i want you
[1:00:30] to come home
[1:00:32] said you're going to find at your home
[1:00:34] the same wife that you've married
[1:00:36] i said i will help you to pray back and
[1:00:39] pray through
[1:00:39] and get back to god again said i don't
[1:00:42] want you to stray
[1:00:43] i wouldn't want you to stay away i said
[1:00:45] look i married you
[1:00:47] upon the basis of what you of not
[1:00:50] what you were but i married you upon
[1:00:53] i married you because i love you
[1:00:56] she said no matter what you do i love
[1:00:59] you
[1:01:00] i married you because i love you
[1:01:04] he says now and the man went to work
[1:01:07] that day
[1:01:07] and it was heard repeating that the
[1:01:09] place where he was working he said now
[1:01:10] how could a man do anything wrong
[1:01:12] against something like that
[1:01:14] when a woman that would love him so much
[1:01:16] so that no matter what he did
[1:01:18] was willing to come back and take him
[1:01:20] again and try it again
[1:01:22] see it shows now you multiply that by
[1:01:25] 10 billion and then you'll have some
[1:01:28] idea
[1:01:29] of what the love of god is see
[1:01:32] that when a man falls in love with jesus
[1:01:34] christ the things of the world
[1:01:36] when you think of what he has done for
[1:01:38] you in all the light of the scripture
[1:01:40] not in the light of an emotion but in
[1:01:42] the light of facts
[1:01:43] what it really is then there's something
[1:01:46] that happens to you
[1:01:47] then the new birth comes and sin is as
[1:01:50] dead as midnight
[1:01:51] when as long as the light that is in you
[1:01:54] how can that light or how can darkness
[1:01:57] even shine
[1:01:57] it just cannot do it
[1:02:01] man that just makes me love him i love
[1:02:04] that he had for me
[1:02:05] i mean it's almost unfathomable right
[1:02:08] but
[1:02:08] a woman that could say that no matter
[1:02:10] what you do you come back you're going
[1:02:11] to find the same life no matter what you
[1:02:13] do
[1:02:14] and i find you multiply that by 10
[1:02:16] billion
[1:02:17] almighty god's love towards me though i
[1:02:20] would fall though i would i would
[1:02:22] he would take me back it creates a love
[1:02:24] and a confidence and you don't want to
[1:02:27] you just don't want to do those things
[1:02:29] no more you see how do you overcome
[1:02:30] temptation
[1:02:32] and love the lord you recognize the
[1:02:34] great love he had for you
[1:02:36] and then it just does something to you
[1:02:38] it takes all that temptation trials and
[1:02:40] difficulties and just casts them into
[1:02:42] the sea
[1:02:42] you don't want nothing of it
[1:02:47] turn in your bibles to first corinthians
[1:03:00] 13.
[1:03:09] it's familiar but i like to bring back
[1:03:12] to your remembrance
[1:03:14] things though i speak with tongues of
[1:03:16] men and angels and have not charity
[1:03:18] i become a sounding brass and tinkling
[1:03:20] symbol though i have the gift of
[1:03:22] prophecy and i understand all mysteries
[1:03:24] and all knowledge and though i have all
[1:03:26] faith so that i can move
[1:03:28] mountains i have not charity i'm nothing
[1:03:31] and though i bestow all my goods to feed
[1:03:32] the poor and though i give my body to be
[1:03:34] burned and have not charity
[1:03:35] it profiteth me nothing charity suffers
[1:03:39] long and is kind charity envious
[1:03:42] not charity vaunteth not itself
[1:03:46] is not puffed up doth not behave itself
[1:03:49] unseemly or seeketh her own
[1:03:51] it is not easily provoked and it
[1:03:53] thinketh no evil
[1:03:55] it rejoiceth not in iniquity but
[1:03:57] rejoices than the truth
[1:03:59] it beareth all things it believeth all
[1:04:00] things and it hopeth all things
[1:04:02] and endureth all things charity
[1:04:05] never faileth but whether there be
[1:04:07] prophecies they shall fail
[1:04:09] where there is tongues they shall cease
[1:04:12] whether there be knowledge
[1:04:14] it shall vanish away for we know in part
[1:04:17] and we prophesy in part but when that
[1:04:20] which is perfect
[1:04:21] is come then that which is in part shall
[1:04:23] be done
[1:04:24] away with and that which is perfect has
[1:04:27] come
[1:04:28] we have today by divine grace a perfect
[1:04:31] interpretation of the word of god with
[1:04:33] divine
[1:04:34] vindication that's not just the
[1:04:37] information
[1:04:38] that's the access and ability to live
[1:04:40] the life that he lived
[1:04:42] that's a very big statement but it has
[1:04:45] to be the truth because his word is
[1:04:46] spirit
[1:04:47] and it's life and if that which is
[1:04:50] perfect is come
[1:04:51] then all the potentials of what he was i
[1:04:54] am
[1:04:56] that's a big statement but what he was
[1:04:59] i am and what i am
[1:05:02] he was we couldn't say this 50 years ago
[1:05:06] we can say it today but you can have
[1:05:09] that word
[1:05:10] but if it's not mixed with faith guess
[1:05:11] what it doesn't do
[1:05:13] anything it doesn't do anything it's got
[1:05:16] to be believed god had to believe his
[1:05:18] own word
[1:05:18] for this whole world to be created so
[1:05:20] does the sons of gods have to believe
[1:05:22] the word
[1:05:22] for you to take control and take
[1:05:24] dominion over the world that you're
[1:05:25] supposed to that's your earth right now
[1:05:28] has to be the same way because you're
[1:05:30] his sons
[1:05:31] and his daughters created in his own
[1:05:33] image and god's the same yesterday today
[1:05:35] and forever
[1:05:36] he's not going to come up with a new way
[1:05:38] it's going to be the same way
[1:05:41] brother bam says let me tell you a
[1:05:42] little secret here the very most
[1:05:44] powerful force in all the world isn't
[1:05:46] speaking with tongues
[1:05:47] it is an interpreting of tongues it
[1:05:49] isn't even to be honored as a minister
[1:05:51] or to be an evangelist or a prophet
[1:05:53] the most powerful weapon that i've ever
[1:05:55] found in my life is love
[1:05:57] ophelia love which the greek word comes
[1:05:59] is like friendship
[1:06:00] like you have for your wife there's a
[1:06:02] difference it'll make a mother for a
[1:06:05] baby run through a blazing fire even if
[1:06:07] her life
[1:06:07] it makes her life nothing that's filial
[1:06:10] what will agapo do
[1:06:12] we must love divinely love one another
[1:06:16] then you don't see your brother's
[1:06:17] mistakes
[1:06:19] if he does make a mistake you'll look
[1:06:22] right over the top of it
[1:06:23] and love him anyhow
[1:06:26] that strikes home a divine love
[1:06:29] projecting you you want to know if
[1:06:30] there's a divine love projecting in you
[1:06:32] let your brother do something that's
[1:06:34] absolutely wrong and give you a right to
[1:06:36] throw him off to the side and forget
[1:06:38] about him and just say hey i want
[1:06:39] nothing to do with him divine love
[1:06:40] inside of you will say i can see past
[1:06:42] that
[1:06:43] divine love in you if there is a divine
[1:06:46] love in you you can be able to look past
[1:06:47] that mistake of your
[1:06:48] husband of your wife of your children
[1:06:53] you can look past those things and just
[1:06:55] keep expressing divine love and you know
[1:06:57] what happens when you express divine
[1:06:58] love in the face of things that aren't
[1:07:00] right
[1:07:00] sovereign grace steps in and produces
[1:07:02] for you the very thing that love desires
[1:07:05] that's exactly what he said it'll take
[1:07:08] over from there
[1:07:09] i love the fact that he wants to fight
[1:07:11] my battles for me but man i wear myself
[1:07:13] out trying to fight him
[1:07:15] it's such a it's such a waste of time
[1:07:19] but we're learning aren't we
[1:07:26] another man says i believe that actually
[1:07:29] if i would make a mistake and i would go
[1:07:31] out with another woman
[1:07:32] and i would come back and confess it and
[1:07:35] tell her hey meaty
[1:07:36] i didn't mean to do that i just got
[1:07:38] caught in a trap this woman
[1:07:40] ran up to me and she grabbed me by the
[1:07:41] arm and started so and so
[1:07:43] i believe she would be understanding i
[1:07:46] do believe that she would forgive me
[1:07:48] but i wouldn't do it for nothing because
[1:07:50] i love her
[1:07:51] though she would forgive me i wouldn't
[1:07:53] do it i wouldn't hurt her
[1:07:55] for nothing though i know she would
[1:07:57] forgive me
[1:07:58] i don't want to hurt her see we always
[1:08:01] want to take this and put it in the
[1:08:02] context of god but remember
[1:08:04] how can you say you love god if you
[1:08:05] can't love those that are with you every
[1:08:06] day
[1:08:08] you know it's easy to put something far
[1:08:10] off but god's giving you the opportunity
[1:08:12] to express divine love
[1:08:13] with everyone seated next to you right
[1:08:16] to look past his mistakes look past
[1:08:19] their mistakes
[1:08:20] and say i love them anyhow i know that
[1:08:23] god's behind that
[1:08:24] badger skin veiled and watch what god
[1:08:27] will do
[1:08:29] because thou has chosen this narrow way
[1:08:31] the harder way that has walked in your
[1:08:32] own choosing
[1:08:34] that has picked the correct and precise
[1:08:35] decision and it's my decision because of
[1:08:38] this momentous decision a huge portion
[1:08:40] of heaven will await thee
[1:08:41] what a glorious decision i was made this
[1:08:45] in and of itself is that which will give
[1:08:48] and make to come to pass
[1:08:49] a tremendous victory in love divine
[1:08:53] message is a tremendous victory in love
[1:08:54] divine
[1:08:57] i think maybe it's a far past the time
[1:09:00] where we can have a confidence in the
[1:09:01] information that we've been told and we
[1:09:03] can put together
[1:09:04] this is how all men will know you're my
[1:09:06] disciples you'll have a love one for
[1:09:08] another
[1:09:10] you'll have a loved one for another and
[1:09:12] if you don't have that loved one for
[1:09:13] another
[1:09:15] time to find an altar because you don't
[1:09:17] love god properly
[1:09:19] something's wrong the iniquity may be
[1:09:21] abounding and it's causing the love of
[1:09:23] god to wax cold in you
[1:09:30] love is elective his love is for his
[1:09:34] elect
[1:09:35] his love is to them apart from human
[1:09:37] merit
[1:09:39] oh i like that he loved me when i was
[1:09:42] stooped in sin
[1:09:43] and not right he still loved me
[1:09:47] it's apart from human merit for it says
[1:09:50] that the purpose of god stands in
[1:09:51] election which is
[1:09:52] exactly opposite to what works or
[1:09:55] anything man can do
[1:09:56] in himself because before the children
[1:09:59] were born he had already said jacob have
[1:10:02] i loved
[1:10:03] esau have i hated herein is set forth
[1:10:06] the love of god
[1:10:07] he desired in love a family of his own
[1:10:10] a family of sons like himself there
[1:10:14] before him lies all mankind in one lump
[1:10:17] of clay
[1:10:18] and out of that same lump he's made some
[1:10:20] vessels of honor
[1:10:21] and others to dishonor the choosing is
[1:10:24] his choosing
[1:10:25] then those chosen born of a spirit will
[1:10:27] be trained
[1:10:28] to conform to his image in their walk
[1:10:32] as he reproves them with all long
[1:10:34] suffering
[1:10:35] and gentleness and mercy chastening them
[1:10:38] with nail scarred hands i like that
[1:10:43] the chastening of those nail scarred
[1:10:45] hands those are the hands that i love so
[1:10:46] much i don't even know if we'll be able
[1:10:48] to look up to him i'll be looking at
[1:10:49] those feet
[1:10:50] and those hands because i know what he's
[1:10:52] done for me
[1:10:53] i know the divine love that projected
[1:10:55] came and produced a sovereign salvation
[1:10:58] that he gave to me has nothing to do
[1:11:00] with me
[1:11:08] he's still jehovah god jesus christ
[1:11:11] remains the same yesterday today and
[1:11:12] forever and don't be afraid
[1:11:14] just sit still trust god believe him
[1:11:16] with all your heart
[1:11:17] be sure of your step then move on with
[1:11:20] god
[1:11:20] you pray and you love him love is the
[1:11:23] most powerful force there is in the
[1:11:24] entire world there's nothing
[1:11:26] as great as love power only
[1:11:30] lies in love
[1:11:34] it changes everything you know it's just
[1:11:38] it's doing something
[1:11:39] it makes you relax makes you calm way
[1:11:42] down
[1:11:43] realizing that this hasn't got a thing
[1:11:46] to do with my abilities at this point
[1:11:48] i've recognized what he did for me and
[1:11:50] because he's conquered me
[1:11:52] now i'm out conquering every obstacle
[1:11:54] that comes my way
[1:11:55] with the same way he conquered me not
[1:11:58] intellect
[1:11:59] not ability not strength of mind
[1:12:04] you see except we can become like little
[1:12:06] children at his feet just
[1:12:08] say lord i i don't i don't i can't do
[1:12:10] nothing i love you father
[1:12:12] you help me and then he goes to battle
[1:12:14] for me
[1:12:15] it's an amazing thing
[1:12:19] turn in your bibles to philippians
[1:12:22] chapters 2.
[1:12:44] philippians chapter 2 if there be any
[1:12:46] cons consolation in christ if there be
[1:12:48] any
[1:12:49] comfort of love if any fellowship of the
[1:12:51] spirit of any bowels of mercies fulfill
[1:12:53] you my love
[1:12:54] that ye be like-minded having the same
[1:12:57] love being of one accord and of one mind
[1:12:59] let nothing be done through strife or
[1:13:01] vainglory but in lowliness of mind
[1:13:04] let each esteem the other better than
[1:13:06] themselves
[1:13:07] look not every man on his own things but
[1:13:09] every man also on the things of others
[1:13:12] let this mind be in you that was also in
[1:13:14] christ jesus
[1:13:15] who being the form of god thought it not
[1:13:17] robbery to be equal with god
[1:13:18] and made himself of no reputation and
[1:13:21] took upon him the form of a servant
[1:13:23] and was made in the likeness of men and
[1:13:26] being found in the fashion of man
[1:13:28] he humbled himself and became obedient
[1:13:30] unto death
[1:13:31] even the death of the cross
[1:13:34] and that's my choice that i get to make
[1:13:37] each and every day
[1:13:38] is to take up my cross take up my ideas
[1:13:42] take up my desires and my wills the ways
[1:13:45] that i would want to do things
[1:13:47] and get things done and say now lord i'm
[1:13:50] going to lay those down
[1:13:51] i'm going to put that cross where it
[1:13:53] needs to be so that your cross can come
[1:13:55] in place
[1:13:56] and take control when those two ways
[1:13:58] meet
[1:13:59] and i'm gonna take your way for this
[1:14:00] whole thing you started this work and
[1:14:02] you're gonna finish this work
[1:14:05] and it's not gonna be the strength of
[1:14:06] our our hands or our might or the might
[1:14:09] of our minds
[1:14:10] it's gonna be when i yield myself to
[1:14:11] whatever the way is that god wants to
[1:14:13] accomplish these things around me
[1:14:15] and it's going to bring a tremendous
[1:14:17] victory in love divine
[1:14:20] musicians will you come
[1:14:30] you know it's interesting for me because
[1:14:32] when i know what god wants me to say
[1:14:34] and that's it i don't i can't go any
[1:14:35] farther than that it's like i have one
[1:14:37] portion of the word
[1:14:38] and once you've delivered it it's like
[1:14:41] be quiet sit down
[1:14:43] that's how i feel and maybe that's maybe
[1:14:46] that's untraditional i don't know
[1:14:48] maybe that's a little bit odd probably
[1:14:50] is
[1:14:52] but that's just how i feel that's what
[1:14:53] was tearing me up that's what was the
[1:14:55] burden that something came in the home
[1:14:57] and i wanted to go a different way
[1:14:59] because i thought lord they know this
[1:15:01] but you can know it and not do it yeah
[1:15:05] you can get so confident in your own
[1:15:08] human ability in the 50 60
[1:15:10] 30 years you've lived on life and
[1:15:11] handled issues and still not be doing
[1:15:14] his will in any of it
[1:15:15] because you weren't doing it his way but
[1:15:18] you say i'm getting results
[1:15:20] yeah yeah we know what spirit that is
[1:15:23] that's not his spirit no we just want to
[1:15:26] be found doing things the way he's
[1:15:28] wanting us to do them
[1:15:30] and if it's by divine love remember it's
[1:15:32] got to be divine love
[1:15:34] that's it's just got to be this whole
[1:15:36] thing has to be that
[1:15:38] this whole thing has to be a victory
[1:15:40] over you
[1:15:41] a victory over every situation but it
[1:15:45] always starts with you
[1:15:46] and it just isn't going to change the
[1:15:48] situation because jesus laid down his
[1:15:50] will
[1:15:50] to do the will of the father and when he
[1:15:53] did that
[1:15:54] then what he what could he do for you
[1:15:55] and me but he had to play the example
[1:15:57] he's our example and that example hasn't
[1:16:00] changed
[1:16:01] in 2000 years that love is still a
[1:16:04] sacrificial love to lay yourself down
[1:16:06] and let him take it from there
[1:16:10] why don't you just stand
[1:16:14] brother chad i'm giving you time to
[1:16:16] continue preaching brother if you want
[1:16:18] to
[1:16:22] i want to read this last one
[1:16:26] watch now perfect love is pure just as
[1:16:28] pure as love is
[1:16:31] now when you love somebody you see you
[1:16:34] take your husband
[1:16:35] or you take your wife now there's no
[1:16:37] need
[1:16:38] of telling anybody that you don't love
[1:16:40] them because you do love them
[1:16:42] and you know that you love them now if i
[1:16:44] ask you how can you prove it to me
[1:16:46] oh i prove it to them by the way that i
[1:16:49] live
[1:16:49] to him if i'm true to a true and an
[1:16:52] honest wife i'm loyal and honest to my
[1:16:54] husband
[1:16:55] and that proves to me that i love my
[1:16:58] wife
[1:16:59] or that i love my husband see your life
[1:17:02] will prove what you
[1:17:03] are same thing that christianity is see
[1:17:06] your faith
[1:17:07] you have confidence in one another it's
[1:17:09] pure
[1:17:10] and it's something that is real that you
[1:17:12] can't show it to somebody else
[1:17:14] yet you got it and your actions prove it
[1:17:17] and when you got pure unadulterated
[1:17:19] faith
[1:17:20] like your love is to your companion then
[1:17:22] you prove it by the way that you
[1:17:24] act you ain't complaining no more
[1:17:27] you know that it's done you're just
[1:17:30] walking along
[1:17:31] no matter what a thing may look like
[1:17:33] what anybody else will say
[1:17:35] you know what has happened you know that
[1:17:37] it's all finished
[1:17:39] just as you know that you love your
[1:17:40] husband as well as you know
[1:17:42] you know you love see the love and faith
[1:17:45] has got to go together
[1:17:47] they are kin folks they love and that
[1:17:49] love will produce the faith
[1:17:51] when satan tempts us we are to resist
[1:17:54] him
[1:17:54] with a perfect faith in a perfect word
[1:17:57] like jesus did
[1:17:58] the word of god is perfect we're to have
[1:18:01] a perfect
[1:18:02] faith and a perfect word to resist satan
[1:18:05] and it all works by a perfect love and
[1:18:07] understanding of what he did for you
[1:18:10] let's just bow our heads for word of
[1:18:12] prayer here
[1:18:15] grace is heavenly father lord we just
[1:18:17] come before you lord very broken up
[1:18:19] service
[1:18:20] lord i am but i i believe with all my
[1:18:24] heart i said what you wanted me to say
[1:18:25] and that's
[1:18:26] that's what i've come to do lord i just
[1:18:28] pray lord that you would
[1:18:30] help us lord help me lord i i
[1:18:33] i feel so ashamed that maybe 10 years of
[1:18:37] my life walking with you and struggling
[1:18:39] and
[1:18:39] ups and downs and difficulties and not
[1:18:42] having
[1:18:43] maybe my home or difficulties around me
[1:18:46] or situations
[1:18:47] happen or come to a place that i want
[1:18:50] them to happen
[1:18:51] i realized maybe so much of it i was
[1:18:53] just doing with human strength
[1:18:55] human understanding human ability i i
[1:18:57] just
[1:18:58] maybe i had forgotten along the journey
[1:19:00] that it was divine love that started
[1:19:02] this whole thing
[1:19:02] in me it was the grace of god that began
[1:19:05] to express in my life and started to
[1:19:07] call and change things that i could just
[1:19:09] not change
[1:19:10] overcome temptations that i just could
[1:19:12] not overcome in myself
[1:19:14] lord it did something to me when i saw
[1:19:17] what you did for me
[1:19:18] lord it changed everything about me and
[1:19:21] lord we're
[1:19:22] being changed from glory unto glory
[1:19:24] father i just pray lord that
[1:19:27] you'd help us lord every situation i
[1:19:30] don't know maybe we left the 99 today to
[1:19:32] go find the one
[1:19:33] i don't know lord maybe there's a trial
[1:19:36] temptation in a situation that they just
[1:19:38] can't seem to get it reconciled
[1:19:40] it becomes so frustrating lord may we
[1:19:43] just be able to
[1:19:44] move out of the side and let let your
[1:19:47] spirit maybe bring this
[1:19:48] natural body these natural minds over
[1:19:51] into that other realm lord
[1:19:52] where we're spiritual kings and priests
[1:19:54] and we live by different rules father
[1:19:57] i pray lord that you'd help the people i
[1:19:59] pray what i said was
[1:20:00] pleasing to you and ultimately it was
[1:20:02] just a help to your people father
[1:20:05] lord we love you and with everything in
[1:20:07] me no matter what comes my way i don't
[1:20:09] know what future holds for me
[1:20:11] but lord with everything in me i want to
[1:20:13] be able to express that same love that
[1:20:15] you had to me
[1:20:16] towards everybody around me father no
[1:20:18] matter what anybody would do
[1:20:20] right or wrong i want to be able to have
[1:20:22] that steadfast love because i remembered
[1:20:24] what you did for me
[1:20:26] help us now lord to be that expressed
[1:20:28] image of your desire
[1:20:30] father we love you we commit ourselves
[1:20:32] to you now in jesus name
[1:20:34] amen amen brother you got a song
[1:20:40] that's fine the love of god
[1:20:46] is greater
[1:20:50] [Applause]
[1:20:51] than
[1:20:56] can ever
[1:21:04] [Applause]
[1:21:08] [Music]
[1:21:12] is
[1:21:17] [Music]
[1:21:27] [Music]
[1:21:40] is
[1:21:41] [Music]
[1:21:54] is
[1:22:08] how
[1:22:22] is
[1:22:26] [Applause]
[1:22:33] [Music]
[1:22:36] i
[1:24:28] yes
[1:24:31] [Music]
[1:24:32] hallelujah how many love him with all of
[1:24:36] your heart
[1:24:37] how many want to love him more
[1:24:41] you know as the cow was preaching
[1:24:46] you just can't help but want to love god
[1:24:48] more
[1:24:50] and the greatest way that we can love
[1:24:52] god more
[1:24:54] is to love ourselves less
[1:24:57] the biggest hindrance we think about a
[1:24:59] relationship in any other kind of
[1:25:00] relationship
[1:25:02] we have problems in our family problems
[1:25:03] with our spouse
[1:25:05] it's usually because we got in the way
[1:25:08] because we're loving ourselves
[1:25:09] more we want to win an argument we want
[1:25:11] to be right we want to prove our point
[1:25:13] we want to be heard we want to be
[1:25:14] acknowledged
[1:25:15] we want whatever we want to not to have
[1:25:18] to suffer
[1:25:19] [Music]
[1:25:20] the same thing's true with god what's
[1:25:22] hindering us is self-love
[1:25:25] that's why we have to take up our cross
[1:25:27] daily we've got to slay this outer man
[1:25:30] and say i don't want to love myself i
[1:25:32] don't want to protect myself i don't
[1:25:34] want to
[1:25:34] have to be acknowledged i don't want to
[1:25:36] have to be pampered i don't want to have
[1:25:38] to be
[1:25:39] protected to where there's no more
[1:25:40] suffering but i want to lay my life down
[1:25:43] daily and take up my cross and follow
[1:25:45] him
[1:25:47] love is pure i want something pure
[1:25:52] not just a love that i give just to get
[1:25:54] something back
[1:25:56] but a love that i give and if you can
[1:25:58] just give
[1:26:00] there's always something from god coming
[1:26:02] back
[1:26:03] and god loved us so that we could be
[1:26:06] free to love him
[1:26:08] what he said so much ties in with so
[1:26:10] many things i want to share tonight
[1:26:13] so we just pray that god will bring us
[1:26:15] all back here tonight at 3 30
[1:26:17] for communion some things i want to
[1:26:20] share
[1:26:21] vast brother gene petri to share just a
[1:26:23] short testimony of
[1:26:25] how the lord delivered him and brought
[1:26:26] him out when he was so sick
[1:26:28] in the hospital there and so he'll share
[1:26:30] that with us and then i've got some
[1:26:32] things that i want to share
[1:26:34] talk about communion but very much in
[1:26:36] the lines of what we've been talking
[1:26:38] about this morning i could see god has a
[1:26:39] continuity in his mind
[1:26:41] for us we come to communion what a
[1:26:44] greater expression of love can you find
[1:26:47] that a man lay down his life for his
[1:26:49] friends then god would come and take on
[1:26:51] the form of human flesh so that he could
[1:26:53] die
[1:26:54] to pay the penalty himself not asking
[1:26:57] somebody else to do it but he come down
[1:26:58] and did it himself
[1:26:59] so that he could express his love to us
[1:27:01] so that he could redeem us back to
[1:27:02] himself
[1:27:03] and when we come to communion how could
[1:27:05] you not but love him
[1:27:07] and if you can love him that way how can
[1:27:08] we not but love one another
[1:27:11] if he shed that precious blood for me
[1:27:12] and it causes me to reciprocate with
[1:27:14] such a love for him
[1:27:15] he also shed that precious blood from my
[1:27:18] brother and sister how can i not love
[1:27:19] them too
[1:27:22] if he deemed my soul valuable enough to
[1:27:24] shed his blood
[1:27:25] he also deemed their soul valuable
[1:27:27] enough to shed his blood
[1:27:29] how can i love him and not love them
[1:27:33] how do we not love one another amen god
[1:27:35] bless you
[1:27:37] let's just bow our heads and pray
[1:27:40] lord jesus we ask god that you would
[1:27:42] just take us from here with these
[1:27:44] thoughts that you shared with us on our
[1:27:46] heart lord
[1:27:48] god we desperately want to love you more
[1:27:51] god we find that we're so handicapped in
[1:27:53] human flesh
[1:27:55] that we're so limited lord that we just
[1:27:57] need to break free god we just need to
[1:28:00] die a greater death to self
[1:28:03] lord i pray that you'd help us help us
[1:28:07] lord to surrender all help us lord to
[1:28:09] give it all up
[1:28:11] help us lord to just lay our our own
[1:28:13] thoughts our own ideas our own emotions
[1:28:15] our own needs lord
[1:28:17] help us to lay them on the altar and
[1:28:19] just give all
[1:28:21] lord that you might be expressed through
[1:28:23] us that we might express our love to you
[1:28:26] god help us lord help us to die a
[1:28:29] greater death
[1:28:31] god i pray to help us to love one
[1:28:33] another the way you want us to
[1:28:35] i pray you help us lord just to be a
[1:28:37] light into the world the way you would
[1:28:39] be a light to the world if you were in
[1:28:40] this body of flesh
[1:28:42] while we love you truly we love you
[1:28:44] words can never express our love to you
[1:28:48] but god you calling by by your love to
[1:28:50] us you've unlocked potentials with on us
[1:28:53] that we didn't even know we're there if
[1:28:56] we can just die and get out of the way
[1:28:58] and surrender lord we pray that by your
[1:28:59] spirit you'd bring them to life
[1:29:02] that you would live your life through
[1:29:03] these vessels of clay
[1:29:06] may what's spoken today be personal to
[1:29:08] us as individuals not a group
[1:29:10] lord but to me that i want to love you
[1:29:13] more that i want to express my love to
[1:29:15] in a greater way that i want to
[1:29:17] surrender more
[1:29:18] i want to die lord so that you can live
[1:29:22] or may it be individual maybe personal
[1:29:25] may it bring results lord oh how we love
[1:29:28] you and we ask god that you would just
[1:29:30] minister
[1:29:31] to each one as an individual and as we
[1:29:33] go lord let our hearts be prepared for
[1:29:36] the communion
[1:29:37] as we come back let's come back in the
[1:29:39] right spirit in the right frame of mind
[1:29:40] with the right expectation
[1:29:43] may you speak to us again tonight as we
[1:29:45] move to communion to remember your death
[1:29:47] and what you've done for us
[1:29:49] we love you god we ask you would bless
[1:29:51] us now
[1:29:52] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[1:29:57] tell you the expression of love
[1:30:01] that brother kyle mentioned to us out of
[1:30:03] brother branham's message
[1:30:05] when when bert saw an expression of love
[1:30:08] and it changed him
[1:30:09] when brother branham had an expression
[1:30:10] of love that changed the raging bull or
[1:30:12] the angry hornets or
[1:30:14] even the atmosphere in his home love
[1:30:17] is all perfect love is expressed
[1:30:20] in the face of trial hardship and danger
[1:30:25] and that's why god never takes trials
[1:30:27] away from us and he never takes us
[1:30:30] he never brings us to a place where we
[1:30:31] avoid dangerous situations or difficult
[1:30:34] places
[1:30:35] are things that require great sacrifices
[1:30:38] on our part
[1:30:38] because that's how his love is expressed
[1:30:42] his love is expressed in our families
[1:30:44] when we have to make great sacrifices
[1:30:46] for the ones we love
[1:30:47] when we have to endure hardship for them
[1:30:50] when we have to make sacrifices for them
[1:30:52] that's a projection of love that's how
[1:30:54] love is expressed that's how god
[1:30:56] expressed his love for us
[1:30:58] that's how we express our love for one
[1:31:00] another and our
[1:31:01] express our love to the family so don't
[1:31:04] be afraid of trials
[1:31:06] don't shy away from hardship or
[1:31:08] suffering or difficulties
[1:31:10] it's the very opportunity for the
[1:31:12] expression of divine love
[1:31:14] and god will accomplish something in all
[1:31:17] of that
[1:31:18] god is doing something now god wants to
[1:31:22] do something and continue to do
[1:31:23] something
[1:31:24] but he'll do it in the face of danger
[1:31:26] difficulty
[1:31:28] and trial what he doesn't need is he
[1:31:30] doesn't need us to buck up or complain
[1:31:32] or
[1:31:33] fuss what he needs is a surrendered
[1:31:35] vessel
[1:31:36] a little lamb that will just follow the
[1:31:38] shepherd wherever the shepherd leaves
[1:31:40] and trust that shepherd and not look to
[1:31:42] the danger and not look to the wolf
[1:31:44] but look up to the shepherd and know
[1:31:46] everything's okay because i'm here with
[1:31:47] him
[1:31:48] and i trust him wherever he leads me if
[1:31:50] it's through the valley of death
[1:31:51] i trust him to lead me there and that
[1:31:54] expression of love for that little lamb
[1:31:56] for the shepherd
[1:31:56] would be a tremendous expression of love
[1:31:58] divine
[1:32:00] that the world will see and they'll take
[1:32:02] note of that kind of love
[1:32:05] may god bless you as we sing another
[1:32:07] song brother ben if you'll sing
