========================================

have we really come to that time in this omega ministry where god continues to work and to fulfill his great desire and to fulfill those things that he left undone for his body to be fulfilled has he put us back in the position of the garden where we're calling ourselves to a conference and saying what cross did i pick up today how can i give him this preeminence how can he take his rest so that i can take mine you know when enoch took the rapture it wasn't like enoch did this all alone he was with somebody he was walking with the lord and he took a rapture you know when brother branham's body changed and he became a young man it wasn't because he was alone he was in the presence of the right person the presence of the right person asked him a question and said you want to walk with me he said lord be the greatest desire of my life right before then he had to make a decision and lord had to reveal to him you walk with too many if you're going to walk with me you walk alone from this point on and so much of us we just don't we know god calls us to those types i could totally i just talked to you like we're sitting at the table right is that okay and we know sometimes god calls us like that he whispers something to us he says hey if you're gonna walk with me you gotta give that up you're gonna walk with me you can't keep doing that if you're gonna walk with me you have to separate why do you think moses god had to take or moses had to take the tabernacle outside of the camp to meet with god there comes a point in time where it's you and you only and it's him and him only and that is your place of rest that is his greatest desire and i think that's the rapture i believe that that's the rapture a place of rest a hiding place in him you know what i mean we are in rapture cycle i get it i know to wit the change in the body is the fullness of redemption but i'm looking at this rest and i'm realizing the earnest of my redemption was the holy spirit and the holy spirit guidance is leading me back behind the veil where the curtain can be shut and i'm with him alone then let the world do whatever it's going to do let it blow up let russia drop bombs and let the economies of the world collapse what do i care i've been shut in i'm shut in i'm closed in and it's just joy bells ringing for me because i know the one i put my confidence in he's promised i'll never leave you and i'll never forsake you i'll lead you i'll guide you don't you ever worry what do i have to worry about i'm in the palm of his hand
