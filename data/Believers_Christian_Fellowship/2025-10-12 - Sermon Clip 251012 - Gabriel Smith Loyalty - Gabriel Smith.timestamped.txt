[0:00] Listen what brother Bham says. I imagine
[0:02] some of his enemies walk around say
[0:04] father of nation how many children do
[0:07] you have
[0:09] don't make any difference how I have now
[0:12] I'm a father of nation that's all how do
[0:14] you know God said so that sell it so
[0:16] along went Abraham you see
[0:21] being so loyal
[0:24] more loyal
[0:29] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:32] &gt;&gt; Who?
[0:33] Wait a minute.
[0:36] I think I think every one of us need to
[0:39] take that quote and put it on our
[0:41] refrigerator.
[0:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:48] Now, I want you to think of somebody
[0:50] that's loyal to you
[0:54] because remember our brains are the ones
[0:58] that need rewired.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; And so Abraham, only a prophet could say
[1:04] this. So Abraham
[1:08] more loyal. Now, if somebody's loyal to
[1:11] you, what are you going to do to them?
[1:14] You're going to patty cake them around
[1:20] &gt;&gt; because why? You don't want to ruin that
[1:23] loyalty. That's
[1:24] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:26] &gt;&gt; You don't want to test
[1:29] &gt;&gt; that loyalty,
[1:32] &gt;&gt; because that would be cruel because
[1:35] they're so loyal to me,
[1:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42] But that's not how God works.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; And that's not how God works with seed
[1:48] of Abraham.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; Right sir. Amen.
[1:50] &gt;&gt; Whom you are.
[1:54] &gt;&gt; And so the more loyal you are.
[1:59] &gt;&gt; Guess what you get.
[2:06] What
[2:09] the?
[2:14] Brother Gabe, can you read the next
[2:15] paragraph? Maybe
[2:22] by chance are you splicing takes,
[2:24] brother?
[2:27] No. No.
[2:31] But remember, you are designed to be
[2:35] seed of Abraham.
[2:38] &gt;&gt; That's how God built you.
[2:43] &gt;&gt; And the more loyal you are is not the
[2:47] more cupcake road you're going to have.
[2:51] &gt;&gt; But more loyal, being so loyal, more
[2:56] loyal, more testing.
[2:59] So he brought him right back. Now
[3:01] remember when God has counted you worthy
[3:05] when you have a test now he says now
[3:08] don't fail this to get this when you
[3:12] have a trial or a test it shows the
[3:15] grace of God
[3:17] has found you.
[3:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:20] You found favor.
[3:23] What?
[3:28] &gt;&gt; Isn't that Isn't that contrary to our
[3:30] thinking?
