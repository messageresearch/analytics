[4:15] pause here for a moment to approach you
[4:17] by way of prayer
[4:20] lord to
[4:21] thank you once again for this

[4:47] that we have that desire to come and to
[4:49] worship you because we know that only
[4:52] you can place that there lord
[4:54] father but even with that being placed
[4:58] there
[4:59] what type of miserable people we would
[5:02] be
[5:03] if we didn't know how to worship you
[5:05] lord or what she was desiring in worship
[5:08] father but you have came and you have
[5:10] revealed yourself to us
[5:13] father and you have opened yourself your
[5:15] word to us lord that you could reveal
[5:17] the secrets to us to let us know
[5:20] how you want to be worshiped
[5:22] and how to appropriately come before
[5:25] your throne
[5:27] lord and we would just pray that we
[5:29] would never take that for granted to
[5:32] have a desire to worship the true god
[5:35] and to know how that he wishes to be to
[5:38] worship
[5:39] father and we just want to come this
[5:41] evening we want to commit the speaker to
[5:43] you we want to commit to hear to you
[5:45] father we just we just ask as we always
[5:48] do father
[5:49] that you would come now and that you
[5:51] would pick up your word and you would
[5:53] loose the seals from the father that you
[5:56] would pick up the bread and that you
[5:57] would break it lord for no man can do
[5:59] this task lord we're we're not saying
[6:02] that to be humble lord it's just the
[6:03] facts we realize that we can't do it
[6:07] that there has to be a supernatural
[6:09] element come at this point in time
[6:11] father to pick up a gift that you would
[6:13] place in a hybrid vessel
[6:15] and that you would minister a pure word
[6:19] we just yield ourselves to you lord
[6:21] thanking you for this opportunity in
[6:23] jesus christ's name we pray
[6:26] amen
[6:28] god bless you if you'll take your bibles
[6:31] we'll turn to
[6:32] revelation chapter 22.
[6:35] it's good to be with you this evening
[6:37] appreciate the atmosphere
[6:40] i want to say god bless you brother
[6:42] tommy and sister barb it's good to have
[6:43] you back we sure missed you
[6:48] i just want to continue
[6:50] [Music]
[6:51] this evening on
[6:53] this topic that i administered on last
[6:55] time on the words of the book
[6:58] and
[6:59] it was kind of a little bit of a strange
[7:01] service for me there at the end i really
[7:03] thought that i was going to get to the
[7:04] end of it and wrap it up but for
[7:06] whatever reason he just said stop so i
[7:08] stopped
[7:10] but brother chad had came the next
[7:12] several services and really just
[7:14] preached everything that i had left so i
[7:17] don't really know the the dynamics of
[7:20] how all of that works sometimes all we
[7:21] know to do is stop
[7:23] and we just have to you know rely on
[7:26] that so
[7:27] you'll have to forgive me if there's a
[7:28] lot of
[7:29] repeat in some of this but i didn't feel
[7:32] the need to go back and change my notes
[7:34] just because he already preached it
[7:36] i just say if that's what god once said
[7:38] then i'm happy to be an echo you know i
[7:41] have zero problems being an echo
[7:43] but we certainly appreciate the word
[7:45] that is being ministered and maybe this
[7:48] will just be uh kind of the same thing
[7:50] in a little bit of a different angle and
[7:52] we'll maybe
[7:53] uh ring a little bit different bell with
[7:55] somebody to bring their attention to
[7:56] somebody to something in particular
[8:00] but that's the direction that i want to
[8:02] try to finish up with this evening so
[8:05] we'll read here in
[8:07] revelation 22 verse 18
[8:11] and it says for i testify
[8:13] unto every man that heareth the words of
[8:16] the prophecy of this book
[8:18] if any man shall add unto these things
[8:21] god shall add unto him the plagues that
[8:24] are written in this book and if any man
[8:26] shall take away from the words of the
[8:28] book
[8:29] of this prophecy god shall take away his
[8:32] part out of the book of life and out of
[8:34] the holy city and from the things that
[8:37] are written in this book and then if
[8:39] you'll turn with me over to ephesians 4
[8:43] we want to read a
[8:45] portion of scripture there
[8:54] ephesians 4 beginning with verse 15.
[9:00] and it says but speaking the truth in
[9:02] love
[9:04] may grow up unto him in all things
[9:07] which is the head even christ
[9:10] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[9:12] together and compacted by that which
[9:15] every joint supply
[9:17] according to the effectual working and
[9:19] the measure of every part
[9:21] maketh increase of the body
[9:24] and to the edifying of itself in love
[9:27] and then for our last scripture we'll
[9:29] turn back to revelation
[9:31] chapter eight
[9:35] very familiar
[9:37] verse here
[9:39] revelation chapter eight
[9:42] just the one verse and when he had
[9:44] opened the seventh seal
[9:47] there was silence in heaven about the
[9:49] space of half an hour god bless you as
[9:52] you would have your seats
[9:55] so if we'll just if you'll bear with me
[9:57] just to do a quick review here
[10:00] um again we were
[10:02] laying emphasis on the words of the book
[10:05] being the believer
[10:06] and that we understand that the book of
[10:09] genesis in the book of revelation is a
[10:11] book of symbols and
[10:13] the
[10:14] ultimate reality of those symbols are
[10:18] you and i
[10:19] um we know even in god's first creation
[10:22] that he created and he would start out
[10:23] with with certain things but at the end
[10:26] of that
[10:27] his final reality was a man
[10:30] and then he took a wife from that man
[10:32] so
[10:33] we understand that god brother brandon
[10:35] says god's heart desire what was moving
[10:38] god what he wanted all the time was he
[10:40] wanted to express himself in flesh
[10:43] so that is the reality we can look at
[10:45] symbols and we can we can look at
[10:47] whatever we want to look at but at the
[10:49] end of the day we have to have a reality
[10:52] and we have to understand what that real
[10:54] reality is and what god is trying to get
[10:56] to and at the end of the day what god is
[10:58] trying to get to is me and you
[11:00] so that's that's the purpose and that's
[11:03] what we want to
[11:05] what we want to drive at
[11:07] in the invisible union
[11:09] brother random said dear god we have
[11:11] just read what we believe to be the
[11:12] sacred word of god and that's what we
[11:15] are believing that not one jot nor
[11:17] tittle shall in no wise pass away from
[11:19] this until it is all fulfilled and we
[11:22] believe that our lord told us in
[11:24] revelation the 22nd chapter that
[11:26] whosoever shall take wor one word from
[11:29] it or add one word to it the same his
[11:31] part will be taken from the book of life
[11:34] and we see that by misrepresentation of
[11:36] this world as
[11:38] word as satan misrepresented it to eve
[11:42] caused her to doubt one word through the
[11:45] whole human race into fallen chaos
[11:49] remember that we're going to touch on
[11:50] that at the end of the service
[11:52] but when satan did that
[11:54] remember in genesis 1 1 brother brandon
[11:56] said he brought the word out of chaos
[11:58] but now when he comes and he trips up
[12:01] eve
[12:02] we're back into chaos
[12:07] just one word
[12:09] then we see in the middle of the book
[12:11] came our lord and savior and he gave us
[12:14] this quotation concerning that man shall
[12:16] not live by bread alone but by every
[12:17] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[12:19] god
[12:20] then the solemn morning in the last book
[12:23] of the revelation of jesus christ who
[12:25] whosoever shall add a word or take a
[12:27] word away his part will be taken from
[12:30] the book of life
[12:31] oh god
[12:32] knowing seeing how fragile we are
[12:35] knowing that we're walking on the
[12:37] brittle threads of this mortal life
[12:40] not knowing what time we're going to be
[12:42] summons to answer on high
[12:44] let us oh lord
[12:45] lay aside everything in our heart
[12:47] everything in our mind and look straight
[12:50] to your word tonight and for you to come
[12:54] and interpret it with living oracles
[12:58] so again we're back to the reality
[13:01] we have the word we have the written
[13:03] word we have the interpretation of the
[13:04] symbols we have the expressed word but
[13:07] now brother branham is saying i'm i'm
[13:09] asking and i'm praying for god to come
[13:11] and interpret this
[13:13] himself
[13:15] by
[13:16] interpreting it through living oracles
[13:19] the final reality
[13:21] so if that is what brother branham is
[13:24] praying for i would just assume that you
[13:28] being a common person like me
[13:30] that would be our prayer if that's what
[13:32] he's praying for
[13:34] i think that's what we should be praying
[13:36] for so we appreciate the interpretation
[13:40] if we want to say it this way the
[13:41] teaching of the doctrines and the
[13:42] interpretation of the symbols but that
[13:45] wasn't just brother branham's prayer his
[13:46] prayer that is that god himself would
[13:50] come on the scene and interpret it in
[13:52] our lives
[13:54] things that are to be i'm going to kind
[13:55] of go fast here because we we really
[13:57] spent a lot of time on this this last
[13:59] time and i believe that
[14:01] the foundation was slayed but i just
[14:03] want to skip through this real fast
[14:05] things that are to be he says we must
[14:07] live by the word because the bride is
[14:08] part of the bridegroom like any
[14:11] man's wife is a part of her husband
[14:14] therefore we must be that word bride and
[14:16] what is the word bride the manifestation
[14:19] of this hour the bride not a creed or a
[14:22] denomination but a living oracle of god
[14:26] so if we're looking for the
[14:26] manifestation of god in this hour what
[14:28] should we be looking for
[14:31] very simple a living attribute of god
[14:34] displaying to the world the attributes
[14:36] of god in the formation of the bride
[14:38] that's to be expressed in this hour that
[14:41] we're now living so if you're looking
[14:43] for the words of the book to be a
[14:45] reality what should you be looking for
[14:48] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[14:50] again another very familiar quote
[14:53] now do you see the seals
[14:55] when he's in his mediatorial work back
[14:58] there redeeming but someday he comes
[15:00] forth to get this book that he's
[15:02] redeemed
[15:03] and all that's in this book would be him
[15:07] for that's the believer the words in the
[15:10] book so that should put
[15:14] any doubt or confusion in our mind
[15:17] away from what god is looking for god is
[15:20] not looking for ink plots on paper
[15:23] we would never degrade this we would
[15:25] never do away with this thank god that
[15:27] he gave us this because in our wretched
[15:29] broken down condition we needed every
[15:31] tool that we could get our hands on
[15:34] but at the end of the day god is not
[15:36] going around looking for pieces of paper
[15:39] he's looking for the words in the book
[15:42] that's the believer
[15:45] and the word is him and all that's in
[15:47] and all that's in that he came forth for
[15:51] this book of redemption
[15:57] whose names are written on the book
[15:59] before the foundation of the world when
[16:01] he was slain as a lamb
[16:04] souls that are in prison now 1963
[16:06] brother branham says what if it is he's
[16:08] asking what if it is this time
[16:11] look at the scriptures piled here
[16:13] could it be
[16:14] is the third pull to preach to the
[16:16] eternal eternally doomed that's rejected
[16:19] the message of salvation will you say
[16:22] the church is going
[16:24] yeah they will they'll go right on just
[16:27] the same but remember all this time
[16:30] noah was in the ark the bride is sealed
[16:33] in with christ the last member has been
[16:36] redeemed the sixth seal has produced
[16:39] itself the seventh seal brings him back
[16:42] to earth
[16:45] this is very profound
[16:49] we've we've had decades of teaching and
[16:51] studying and wondered number one is this
[16:53] is the seals even open
[16:55] and then it'll come to the seventh seal
[16:56] is the seventh seal even open but now
[16:58] brother branham would come and he would
[17:00] say the seventh seal brings him back to
[17:02] earth
[17:04] so now we have to go through the whole
[17:05] rigging road again oh okay brought him
[17:07] back to earth okay he was in brother
[17:08] branham
[17:10] but that's not where he's that's not
[17:11] where he stopped at because brother
[17:12] branham's off the scene
[17:14] so if the seventh seal brought him back
[17:16] to earth in the fullness of his word in
[17:17] the form of the prophet and that prophet
[17:19] goes off the scene we only have one of
[17:20] two options either god is not here or he
[17:23] went somewhere else
[17:28] the seventh seal brings him back to
[17:30] earth
[17:31] the lamb came and took the book out of
[17:34] the right hand of him and sat down and
[17:35] claimed what he owed
[17:37] what he owned what he had redeemed that
[17:40] right it's always been that third pull
[17:42] three is perfection the ministry come to
[17:45] its perfection when it reproduced christ
[17:48] again
[17:49] in natural
[17:51] amongst human beings
[17:54] as was predicted
[17:56] [Music]
[17:57] as it was in the days of lot so he's
[18:00] referring back to as it was in the days
[18:02] of lot we know what happened on the
[18:03] plains of memory when god himself came
[18:05] down in the form of a human being
[18:07] spoke to abraham but i want to throw
[18:10] something else in here again
[18:12] the ministry come to its perfection when
[18:14] it reproduced christ again in natural
[18:17] amongst human beings as was predicted
[18:23] as it was in the days of lot
[18:26] so he's saying as it was in the days of
[18:28] lot it's going to happen now and that is
[18:30] the perfection
[18:31] that's this third pull
[18:35] so what happened in the days of lot it
[18:37] was god himself
[18:39] took on the form of man and came down
[18:42] and spoke with abraham had fellowship
[18:45] with another human being
[18:48] that was what brother branham says the
[18:50] ministry come to its perfection
[18:55] so now let's look at revelation 8.
[19:13] revelation 8 1.
[19:25] the ministry come to its perfection
[19:28] when it reproduced christ again in
[19:31] natural
[19:33] amongst human beings
[19:35] as was
[19:36] predicted as it was in the days of lot
[19:40] revelation 8 1 and when he had opened
[19:43] the seventh seal there was silence in
[19:45] heaven
[19:46] about the space of a half an hour
[19:51] you say well those how do those
[19:52] correspond together
[19:55] because brother brandon says the seventh
[19:56] seal brought him back to earth
[19:59] and he just says the perfection of the
[20:02] ministry
[20:03] was when he reproduced christ again in
[20:05] natural amongst human beings as was
[20:08] predicted
[20:09] as it was in the days of lot
[20:13] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[20:15] there was silence in heaven
[20:18] it did not say there was silence on
[20:20] earth
[20:24] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[20:26] there was silence in heaven
[20:29] now we can understand why brother
[20:30] branham says the seventh still brings
[20:31] him back to earth there was silence in
[20:35] heaven
[20:36] why was there silence in heaven because
[20:38] he's not in heaven anymore
[20:41] there was silence in heaven
[20:43] not on earth
[20:45] brother branham says those thundered
[20:47] thunders did not sound from heaven he
[20:49] says they sounded from earth
[20:52] and the seventh seal brought him to
[20:54] earth
[20:57] don't leave all of that past tense
[21:01] don't leave all of that past tense in
[21:03] the 50s and the 60s when the symbols
[21:05] were being exposed brother branham says
[21:07] it came to its perfection
[21:10] when it reproduced christ again amongst
[21:12] natural human beings as it was in the
[21:15] days of lot
[21:16] so brother branham could have came and
[21:18] he could have preached the seals and he
[21:19] could have revealed all of the symbols
[21:21] and it still would not have been in its
[21:23] perfection
[21:26] because it came to its perfection the
[21:29] seventh seal came to its perfection
[21:32] when it brought him back to earth when
[21:34] it reproduced christ again in natural
[21:36] human beings
[21:39] so don't leave it in the days of lot
[21:43] don't leave it in the 50s or the 60s
[21:46] allow it
[21:47] to produce its perfection again
[21:50] amongst natural human beings
[21:53] and as i said i said this last time but
[21:55] i want to say it again because this is
[21:58] i feel this is very pertinent
[22:01] the mind of god
[22:04] has been expressed we would all agree
[22:05] with that i believe
[22:07] in the fullness of its word the mind of
[22:08] god has been expressed
[22:11] but the mind of god is not just here
[22:15] because the symbols have been
[22:17] interpreted
[22:18] the mind of god is here
[22:22] because the people that that mind
[22:25] consisted of
[22:27] are here
[22:30] does that make sense
[22:32] so we can have the interpretation of the
[22:34] symbols but if there is no perfection of
[22:36] that if there is no reality of that then
[22:38] that mind has not
[22:40] has still not been completely revealed
[22:42] it takes a natural human being
[22:45] in flesh
[22:46] to bring that and express that
[22:50] so we can have the mind of god revealed
[22:53] inter as the as the written word
[22:55] interpreted
[22:57] but unless the people are here to
[23:00] believe that and to live that into an ex
[23:03] and to express that it still has not
[23:05] come to its perfection
[23:08] and quite frankly the book has still not
[23:10] been loosed
[23:12] because the words in the book are the
[23:13] believer
[23:14] and until that word is expressed through
[23:16] a believer
[23:18] it has not been it has not come to its
[23:20] perfection
[23:22] in the masterpiece it says
[23:24] now for nearly 2000 years god has again
[23:26] been making him a masterpiece because he
[23:29] struck adam to get a piece off of him
[23:31] part of a rib to make a wife for him and
[23:33] now the perfect masterpiece that he
[23:35] struck at calvary he got a piece off of
[23:37] him it's just the new testament that's
[23:40] all
[23:41] so now you don't have to wonder if this
[23:42] is just a good thought that i've made up
[23:44] and i
[23:45] am sharing it here is brother branham
[23:48] explicitly saying
[23:50] that the bride that is taken from christ
[23:53] is the new testament
[23:55] she is the words in the book she is the
[23:58] final interpretation of the symbols her
[24:00] daily life the thunder that shakes the
[24:03] devil
[24:04] the third pull coming to its perfection
[24:06] the seventh seal that's bringing him to
[24:08] earth
[24:09] the bride the new testament
[24:12] that's all she is
[24:14] just the new testament that's all that's
[24:16] all you are
[24:18] not much just the new testament that's
[24:20] all
[24:22] praise the lord
[24:24] he fulfilled the old testament now it's
[24:26] the new testament another piece to be
[24:28] fulfilled see the new and oldest husband
[24:30] and wife see and it takes the old to
[24:32] foreshadow the new christ come the
[24:34] masterpiece to fulfill that now his
[24:36] bride will fulfill everything that's in
[24:38] the new testament another masterpiece is
[24:41] in the making as is taking him 4 000
[24:44] years to make this masterpiece
[24:47] now he's been for nearly 2 000 years
[24:49] making another masterpiece a bride for
[24:52] christ
[24:53] another masterpiece
[24:56] just the new testament that's all so
[24:59] if you think a little bit of yourself
[25:01] you're just remember you're just the new
[25:03] testament that's all that you are
[25:07] 1962 an absolute and this is the quote
[25:10] that i shared with you last time that
[25:11] really all of this inspiration uh
[25:14] spurred from he says listen i want to
[25:16] tell you something he had a purpose in
[25:19] saving me
[25:21] he had a purpose in saving you
[25:23] and i am determined by his will to do it
[25:26] not to add to it or take away from it
[25:29] revelation 22 19.
[25:33] so as we expressed last time brother
[25:34] branham took the purpose of his life and
[25:37] he stuck it in the scriptures and he's
[25:39] and he said
[25:41] if you would take away from the purpose
[25:43] of my life that's the same as what is
[25:45] speaking in revelation 22 19 you if you
[25:48] take away from the purpose of my life
[25:50] you are taking away from the words of
[25:51] the book
[25:53] your name will be taken out of the book
[25:55] of life if you were to if you were to
[25:56] try to hinder
[25:58] his ministry his purpose
[26:01] that was equivalent to taking words out
[26:04] of the book
[26:06] but you remember he says he had a
[26:08] purpose in saving me he had a purpose in
[26:11] saving you
[26:13] and then he says i am determined to do
[26:16] it by his will not to add take it or
[26:18] take away from it according to
[26:19] revelation 22 19. so he put you in there
[26:23] as well before he referenced revelation
[26:25] 22 19. so now anybody that would hinder
[26:28] or to take away from your purpose
[26:32] would be equivalent to taking words out
[26:34] of the book or adding words to the book
[26:37] and as i shared last time we could get
[26:39] all worked up about that like yeah
[26:40] somebody's trying to stomp me down
[26:42] they're trying to run my ministry
[26:43] they're trying to take out this part
[26:44] that i serve they're trying to do this
[26:45] they're trying to do that
[26:47] and we can get all worked up about that
[26:49] but my real question is what are you
[26:50] doing about it what am i doing about it
[26:54] because if somebody would take away from
[26:56] my part of the book of life
[27:00] god will deal with them
[27:04] that's what uh forgive me i think it was
[27:07] michael you know when when they were
[27:08] disputing about the body of moses he's
[27:10] he just he just told him he says the
[27:12] lord deal with you the lord the lord he
[27:15] knew where he stood
[27:17] he knew where he stood he just said the
[27:18] lord will deal with you so i'm not
[27:20] concerned if somebody's going to try to
[27:22] wait take away from my part of the book
[27:24] of life because quite frankly if they
[27:25] could take away from my part of the book
[27:27] of life it's not in the book of life
[27:29] because heaven and earth will pass away
[27:30] but my words will not fail
[27:32] so maybe it's something that i've added
[27:34] to the word that they're taking away
[27:36] from and it probably needs taken away
[27:37] from them
[27:38] but if somebody is really genuinely
[27:40] attacking my
[27:43] and when i say this i know a lot of
[27:45] a lot of times we would automatically
[27:46] think okay you're a minister you stand
[27:47] behind the pulpit you preach that's true
[27:49] but but that's
[27:50] i would say that's the minor that i'm
[27:52] speaking about i'm talking about the
[27:54] real purpose for my life that god has
[27:57] for me so don't just say oh yeah that
[27:59] applies to a minister it don't just
[28:01] apply to a minister it applies to each
[28:02] and every one of us
[28:04] that's just a small portion
[28:06] but if somebody would try to take away
[28:09] from the purpose god had in saving me
[28:12] what dangerous treacherous grounds
[28:14] they're on but like i said i'm not even
[28:17] concerned if they do that because that's
[28:19] not the real enemy the real enemy is me
[28:23] the real enemy is what am i getting
[28:25] distracted by
[28:28] what am i doing that would hinder him
[28:30] fulfilling his purpose for saving me
[28:33] that's the real issue because god will
[28:35] deal with somebody else
[28:37] i don't even need to give them the time
[28:39] god will deal with them
[28:42] but i need god to deal with me and i
[28:44] need to be honest with myself and i need
[28:46] to scrutinize myself
[28:49] what if anything am i doing
[28:52] that would add to or take away his
[28:54] purpose for saving me
[28:57] and that's that's really my
[29:00] what i'm trying to express from my heart
[29:01] here
[29:02] is i
[29:04] have
[29:05] to be honest and i've got to be real
[29:08] and i've got to examine that
[29:11] and if there's something there i've got
[29:12] to deal with it
[29:14] and each and every one of you has to do
[29:15] the same
[29:17] the external influence is not what we're
[29:20] fighting
[29:23] the external influence is not what we're
[29:25] fighting
[29:26] it's going to be an internal issue
[29:29] that's going to be detrimental
[29:32] that's what we need to focus on that's
[29:33] what we need to deal with and that's
[29:35] what we need to examine each and every
[29:37] day am i doing anything that is adding
[29:40] to or taking away
[29:42] from the real purpose of my life that
[29:44] god had been saving me
[29:49] doors and doors
[29:51] 1965
[29:54] some time ago i read a story of the days
[29:56] of lincoln he was deprived of an
[29:57] education but yet with something in his
[29:59] heart some purpose i like a man of
[30:01] vision i like people that's got
[30:03] something they're fighting for just not
[30:05] just laying around well whatever comes
[30:07] along will be all right be up and add it
[30:12] now
[30:13] this is not a motivational speech
[30:19] this
[30:20] this is a reality this is not a this is
[30:23] not a pep rally to get you all riled up
[30:26] of oh yeah i'm gonna go do something for
[30:28] god
[30:29] that's that's not it
[30:31] this
[30:32] that this is a pep rally for you to seek
[30:36] god and find out what he wants you to do
[30:40] and what the purpose is for your life
[30:43] and then go do it but this is not a this
[30:45] is not just a motivator or speech
[30:47] motivational speech of yeah i want to do
[30:49] something for god be up and at it go and
[30:51] do it
[30:53] that could end up really good that could
[30:55] end up really really bad that's not what
[30:56] we're after
[30:58] what we're after is to find the purpose
[31:00] of our life to find the words in the
[31:03] book because the words in the book is
[31:05] what won't fail
[31:06] me and you will fail
[31:08] in our hybrid condition but the word
[31:10] that's in us will not fail the purpose
[31:11] that he had for saving us will not fail
[31:14] and that's what we have to have and then
[31:16] once we find that i would say
[31:18] be motivated
[31:20] be have a pep rally go and do it be
[31:22] about it have a vision
[31:25] but it's not it's just not frivolous
[31:28] we have to seek the purpose first
[31:31] be up and at it and lincoln never had
[31:34] let his education stand in the way he
[31:36] had something to do i think every
[31:38] christian ought to be that way find your
[31:41] purpose
[31:43] and go do it
[31:45] in that order
[31:47] find your purpose
[31:50] and then go do it for every member of
[31:52] this chapter just not well we have a
[31:54] breakfast once once a month that isn't
[31:56] it or once every saturday have a purpose
[32:00] in life
[32:01] something you're going to do god has
[32:04] placed you here do something about it
[32:08] so he is motivating you to do something
[32:11] about it but look at the order that he
[32:13] puts it in
[32:15] find your purpose
[32:18] not of yourself allow god to reveal that
[32:20] to you
[32:21] find your purpose and then go do
[32:22] something about it so thank you for
[32:24] allowing me the time to do the review
[32:26] let's move forward
[32:28] the identified masterpiece of god then
[32:31] the sad story comes of the enemy now
[32:33] notice
[32:35] this one thing i want you to bear in
[32:36] mind that god gave this man a protection
[32:39] he's speaking of adam
[32:40] he gave him he fortified him inside of
[32:43] his word because he told them what they
[32:46] could do what they could not do he
[32:48] placed him behind his word
[32:54] how did he do that he told him what he
[32:56] could do and what he couldn't do he
[32:58] revealed to him the purpose of his life
[33:03] and that was equivalent to god placing
[33:06] him behind his word
[33:09] now you must never get from behind that
[33:12] when you do you're opening the door to
[33:14] the enemy when you get outside of the
[33:17] purpose for your life
[33:20] you are opening the door for the enemy
[33:23] when they say oh well you can do a
[33:25] little bit of this and a little bit of
[33:27] that
[33:27] god wants you to separate yourself from
[33:30] everything that's called sin
[33:32] completely set aside for him and for him
[33:36] only
[33:37] he has a purpose in your life
[33:40] each individual that no one else on the
[33:42] face of the earth can take your place
[33:45] god has got something for you you're
[33:47] made like that you as did that way for a
[33:50] purpose god is sovereign in his work he
[33:52] makes men different he gives us each one
[33:55] a different place
[33:57] nobody can take your place
[34:00] and you shouldn't try to take anybody
[34:03] else's place
[34:07] goes both ways
[34:09] nobody can take your place
[34:12] and you shouldn't try to take somebody
[34:14] else's place
[34:16] because you are an individual to god and
[34:18] god has a purpose for you
[34:20] he made you thus you say why did he do
[34:23] it he is sovereign he's got a reason for
[34:25] it being that way but we find out that
[34:28] we're all guarded by the word
[34:32] how are we guarded by the word because
[34:34] each and every one of us have a specific
[34:36] purpose and when we stay in that purpose
[34:38] we're guarded by the word that is
[34:41] equivalent to being guarded by the word
[34:43] look at the emphasis look at the
[34:46] seriousness of this
[34:50] look how important we should view this
[34:54] we're literally talking about the words
[34:57] in the book saints and he has said
[34:59] heaven and earth would pass away but my
[35:01] words would not pass away
[35:05] how earnestly we should seek god
[35:10] how much preeminence we should seek we
[35:13] should give him
[35:17] i don't believe that we should we should
[35:19] go a day
[35:21] without acknowledging him as the
[35:24] scripture says acknowledge me and i will
[35:26] direct your paths
[35:27] so what happens if you don't acknowledge
[35:29] him
[35:30] he's not going to direct your paths
[35:35] but look at the seriousness of that god
[35:38] himself has said
[35:39] heaven and earth will pass away
[35:42] but the purpose of my bride's
[35:45] individual's life
[35:46] that will not pass away
[35:48] that will stand
[35:51] but that's only true if we're seeking
[35:53] him for that purpose
[35:55] and we have the true purpose not just
[35:57] something we think is the purpose not
[35:58] just something we want to do not just
[36:00] something we think is right but the real
[36:02] genuine thing
[36:06] it's serious it's not a game
[36:08] i believe if we could really ever catch
[36:11] a glimpse
[36:13] into our true position and what it means
[36:17] we would approach our daily lives much
[36:18] different and i say that for me not just
[36:20] for you
[36:22] i really believe if we could comprehend
[36:27] the seriousness of that
[36:30] just think of the statement brother bran
[36:32] made he says when that bride go when
[36:34] that bride goes there's no more mercy
[36:38] just look at that one single statement
[36:41] and the impact that that has look at the
[36:43] seriousness look how detrimental it is
[36:47] that we get this right and we're not
[36:49] going to get it right on our own saints
[36:51] it's impossible we're going to mess it
[36:53] up every time we have got to earnestly
[36:56] seek him for this revelation
[37:03] why did he do it because he is sovereign
[37:05] but we find out that we're all guarded
[37:06] by the word in heaven we look at the
[37:09] celestial bodies he's referring to the
[37:11] stars brother chad quoted this it was
[37:13] amazing to me so i'm not going to go
[37:15] into it but i've been looking at this
[37:17] this quote that brother branham said
[37:19] about the stars he says you see a
[37:20] shooting star or a star falling he says
[37:22] no you didn't he says you saw some type
[37:24] of weather light you know
[37:25] you know a clinker or something like
[37:27] that he says if one of those real true
[37:30] celestial bodies one of those real true
[37:31] stars would ever move position
[37:34] everything would go into chaos
[37:37] and we know that's true
[37:39] we know that's true
[37:41] because remember god expressed himself
[37:44] in three ways he first expressed himself
[37:45] in the heavenly bodies he expressed
[37:47] himself in the pyramid and then he
[37:48] expressed himself in the written word
[37:50] and the fourth the reality he expressed
[37:52] himself in your non-life
[37:55] so if one of those celestial bodies
[37:57] would move one of those real stars that
[37:59] represents us
[38:01] one of those stars that represents us
[38:03] would move from its position brother
[38:04] branham says it would cause chaos in the
[38:07] whole heavenly realm
[38:10] if you would go over to the pyramid
[38:12] and you would take a little
[38:14] chisel
[38:15] and you would out one of those
[38:16] stones that you thought was
[38:17] insignificant
[38:19] what do you think is going to happen to
[38:20] the pyramid
[38:22] it's going to crumble
[38:24] now it might not crumble in a day
[38:28] it might not crumble in a week it might
[38:29] not crumble in a month it may not even
[38:31] crumble in 400 years
[38:34] but if you take that stone out of there
[38:36] eventually
[38:38] eventually
[38:39] that pyramid is going to come down
[38:42] because if we're the words in the
[38:44] book were the stones in the pyramid and
[38:47] were the stars in the heavens
[38:52] where does that put our daily life
[38:56] what significance
[38:58] you say oh it's just one little stone
[39:00] you can take that out
[39:03] it's going to crumble
[39:05] the body of christ without each and
[39:07] every individual in their position
[39:09] fulfilling the purpose is going to
[39:11] crumble
[39:13] we just read that in ephesians 4
[39:15] he says every joint has to supply
[39:18] you can't take one of those joints out
[39:20] and expect it to work it's not going to
[39:25] so even if it's a small little stone in
[39:27] the very corner of that pyramid i want
[39:30] it to stay there
[39:32] the same as i don't want one word taken
[39:34] out of this
[39:36] take one word out of this and it's going
[39:37] to crumble
[39:41] your daily life is on the same level
[39:44] it has to be there it has to be in the
[39:47] right spot doing the right thing and it
[39:49] cannot be moved
[39:54] the bible says that even one star
[39:56] differs from the other and there is
[39:58] angels such as there is serpents and
[40:00] cherubims and angels and great angels in
[40:02] degrees and even in the new world to
[40:04] come the kings of the earth bring their
[40:06] honor into the city we're always going
[40:08] to be that way because god is not a
[40:10] sears and robot harmony house he is a
[40:12] god of variety
[40:14] he makes one one way and one another but
[40:17] we must serve him
[40:19] in the way that god has made us
[40:22] and be glad and stay behind the word
[40:27] serve him in the way that he made you
[40:29] be glad about it
[40:31] and stay behind his word stay in your
[40:34] purpose
[40:35] 1963 why christ speak brother branham
[40:38] says moses
[40:40] being born with this great gift of faith
[40:44] then he was anointed and commissioned at
[40:46] the burning bush to deliver god's people
[40:50] now see what qualifies man to be great
[40:55] now see what great qualities this man
[40:57] had
[40:59] he was born for a certain thing god had
[41:01] a purpose in it
[41:03] god has a purpose of you being here if
[41:06] you can only be
[41:09] get to that place
[41:11] how much trouble you save god and
[41:14] yourself to
[41:17] that's self-explanatory i don't think i
[41:19] need to expound on that 1963 influence
[41:22] now we find out uzziah got lifted up and
[41:25] he's going to do it anyhow remember this
[41:28] is when uzziah goes in
[41:30] to the temple where he's not supposed to
[41:31] be
[41:33] and he says he's going to do it anyhow
[41:35] he grabbed up the censer and took off it
[41:38] didn't make any difference what the
[41:39] priest said
[41:41] didn't make any difference what they
[41:42] preached different didn't make any
[41:44] difference what the ministry said
[41:46] they're going to do it anyhow
[41:50] it didn't make any difference what the
[41:51] priest said he was going to do it anyhow
[41:55] and it was against the scripture
[41:57] it was unscriptural for him to do that
[42:00] can we all say amen
[42:03] listen what he says next
[42:05] it's unscriptural for you
[42:08] or i
[42:09] to impersonate anyone else
[42:14] what happened to uzziah when he went in
[42:16] there and took a position that he didn't
[42:17] belong in
[42:20] the ministry is trying to warn them
[42:23] maybe they even tugged on the shirt tell
[42:25] said don't do it maybe they tried to
[42:26] physically restrain them but brother
[42:27] brandon said he's going to do it anyhow
[42:29] and he did it
[42:31] and how did he end up
[42:33] smitten with leprosy
[42:36] brother brandon says leprosy re is is a
[42:39] sign of sin
[42:44] so if you try
[42:45] to fulfill somebody else's position or
[42:48] i'll just say it like he said if you try
[42:51] to impersonate anyone else
[42:54] it is unscriptural he doesn't just say
[42:58] it's a bad idea
[43:00] like you shouldn't do that like it's
[43:02] annoying
[43:03] like people will notice
[43:05] it's unscriptural
[43:08] where is he getting that
[43:11] where is he getting that it's
[43:12] unscriptural
[43:14] for you to impersonate somebody else
[43:17] revelation 22 18.
[43:19] [Music]
[43:21] because the purpose of your life is the
[43:23] words in the book
[43:24] and if somebody else would try to
[43:26] impersonate that it's unscriptural
[43:29] so it's
[43:30] the same for you if you would try to
[43:31] impersonate somebody else's position
[43:34] it's unscriptural and you like i said
[43:36] you'll have to forgive me if some of
[43:37] this is repeat but i i just did not feel
[43:40] to to change my notes to change my
[43:42] direction
[43:44] but i feel that it's relevant i feel
[43:45] that it's important i feel that it's
[43:47] true
[43:48] we have to have a good proper
[43:50] understanding of our position of our
[43:52] calling of our uniqueness of our purpose
[43:56] as individuals in life
[43:59] right so be what you are
[44:02] and be a good one
[44:03] and fulfill your purpose so others can
[44:05] see you if you're a housewife be a real
[44:07] one see if you're a husband be a genuine
[44:11] if you're a deacon be a genuine or a
[44:13] preacher whatever you are but don't try
[44:15] to take somebody else's place
[44:19] this is one of my favorite quotes here
[44:21] it just blew my mind when he when he
[44:22] said this 1964 identification
[44:25] says that wasn't moses's thought
[44:28] he was only doing what god had ordained
[44:30] him to do all of them didn't have to be
[44:32] moses
[44:34] the people only had to follow what he
[44:37] said
[44:38] everyone didn't have to create and do
[44:41] miracles and things
[44:43] that's what's the trouble with people
[44:45] today
[44:48] a lady asked me coming down the road the
[44:50] other day from up here she said brother
[44:51] branham
[44:52] i fast and fast and fast and i still
[44:57] can't cast out devils
[45:00] i said
[45:03] he wasn't born to do such
[45:07] your duty is too fast
[45:11] how profound
[45:13] she's doing something naturally
[45:17] and she's excellent at it
[45:20] and she fast and she fast and she fast
[45:24] but she's all bothered because she can't
[45:27] cast out devils
[45:29] but now a vindicated prophet would come
[45:30] on the scene and it was probably the
[45:32] easiest question that he had that day
[45:35] that's simple sis
[45:37] you weren't born for that
[45:39] your duty is to fast now listen
[45:43] the holy spirit is working on somebody
[45:46] else out there
[45:48] for that
[45:49] to cast out the devils
[45:55] i would hate to be the minister
[45:58] or the one that's to cast out the devil
[46:00] who's done it now for three years
[46:02] straight
[46:03] because of this little lady fasting
[46:06] and she gets a complex i would say that
[46:09] we could agree here she had a complex
[46:11] brother branham said who it was i
[46:12] believe it was sister shakarian
[46:15] she's got a complex she can't cast out a
[46:17] devil
[46:18] i would hate to be the guy that because
[46:20] she got that complex she didn't fast
[46:21] that day
[46:23] and here i am amongst thousands of
[46:24] people brother branham is ministering to
[46:26] thousands of people casting out demons
[46:28] left and right
[46:29] maybe not even brother branham maybe
[46:31] other ministers we won't want to limit
[46:33] the holy spirit to one ministry at that
[46:35] point in time there were healing and and
[46:37] faith ministries all over the place so
[46:39] who knows she may have been operating
[46:41] all of them
[46:42] but what about the guy
[46:45] who's there
[46:47] doing this
[46:48] but she got a complex
[46:50] and says i'm taking the day off
[46:54] he falls flat on his face
[46:56] and now everybody blames him because he
[46:58] can't cast out a devil
[47:02] but he can't do anything unless this
[47:04] little lady fasts
[47:07] because that's her purpose
[47:09] and this is his purpose
[47:12] so how can this guy get all big and
[47:14] proud of himself for casting out devils
[47:17] when in all reality his only power comes
[47:19] from this little lady who has a complex
[47:21] she can't cast out a single devil and
[47:23] all she can do is fast
[47:29] you say well that's real that's real
[47:31] elementary
[47:32] that's how it works saints
[47:35] that is the reality of it
[47:38] that is how it works literally brother
[47:42] branham looked into her life said you
[47:43] weren't born for that you were born for
[47:45] this and somebody else is born for that
[47:49] and unless they both work in tandem
[47:51] unless they both can come to an
[47:54] agreement and a confidence towards god
[47:57] that this is my position i'm going to do
[48:00] it i'm going to be glad
[48:02] and i'm going to be happy
[48:04] and i'm going to let him work out
[48:05] whatever he needs to work out
[48:08] they'll save themselves a lot of trouble
[48:10] and got a lot of trouble
[48:12] because what if she just has it in her
[48:13] mind that unless i can cast out a devil
[48:16] i'm not doing anything else
[48:20] i don't know how many ministries would
[48:21] have went off the scene
[48:25] but it was pertinent that she did that
[48:27] that was her part that's what brother
[48:30] bran says she was born for
[48:34] the holy spirit is working on somebody
[48:36] else out there for that you don't know
[48:38] your place
[48:40] if we had time we'd like to teach those
[48:42] things in long meetings
[48:44] how that one person is burdened like
[48:46] this for something over here you don't
[48:48] know you don't and not it's not for you
[48:51] to know
[48:54] it's him doing it
[48:56] you're just submissive to your call and
[48:59] always line it up with the scripture see
[49:01] if it's right or not
[49:06] your name
[49:09] is not scratched off the book of life
[49:13] when god setting up on his ivory throne
[49:16] with his scroll
[49:17] and his feather pen
[49:20] goes down the list and says bad boy
[49:23] scratches it off
[49:27] your name is scratched off the book of
[49:30] life
[49:31] when you fail to fulfill the purpose
[49:34] wherein he has called you
[49:36] or
[49:37] you try to fulfill somebody else's
[49:39] purpose
[49:41] because that's when you add to or take
[49:44] away from the book and the penalty for
[49:46] that is your name is taken off the book
[49:48] of life
[49:53] because we're properly taught
[49:55] we can always have the argument to that
[49:57] i'm bride my name can't be taken off the
[49:58] book
[50:00] and i'll agree 100
[50:02] but you're sure going to cause yourself
[50:03] a lot of trouble and god a lot of
[50:05] trouble
[50:07] if you don't find your purpose
[50:09] and stay there
[50:12] i'm not i'm not worried about your name
[50:14] been taken off or my name been taken off
[50:16] we've been properly taught we have an
[50:18] understanding of that
[50:21] but if you think that i'm convinced that
[50:23] we can't cause god a lot of trouble or
[50:26] our brothers and sisters a lot of
[50:27] trouble
[50:28] or ourselves a lot of trouble
[50:31] you're in a different dimension than
[50:32] what i am and please help me to get
[50:33] there
[50:37] how much rest that i no doubt how much
[50:40] rest that brought to that little lady
[50:42] she's all tore up and bothered that she
[50:44] can't cast out a devil a vindicator
[50:47] prophet says don't worry about it you're
[50:48] not called for that you're called the
[50:49] fast
[50:50] you mean you mean
[50:52] the thing
[50:54] that i just do naturally i'm called to
[50:56] do
[51:00] that's why brother branham says
[51:02] god's gift always find their places
[51:04] because it's god's gift not your gift
[51:07] and god's gift will always find its
[51:08] places
[51:09] because the words of the book cannot
[51:11] pass away even if heavens and earth do
[51:15] so why in the world would god create
[51:18] a
[51:19] individual
[51:22] and purpose them to do something that is
[51:25] totally against how he has wired their
[51:28] nature
[51:29] and how he has made them i'm not talking
[51:31] about your hybrid nature i'm talking
[51:32] about your born-again godly holy spirit
[51:35] nature and gifts
[51:38] why
[51:38] would god
[51:41] why would god want me to sing specials
[51:47] i wasn't born for such
[51:50] why would he want me to play the piano
[51:52] i'm not wired for that i couldn't tell
[51:55] you if it was on key or off key
[51:58] or if you needed a key to start it i
[52:00] don't know
[52:02] i know when it works right and i like it
[52:04] but outside of that i don't know
[52:09] but he's wired me for a certain thing
[52:10] he's made me for a certain thing
[52:15] it would be laughable
[52:17] you all have already confirmed that
[52:19] it would be laughable for me to do that
[52:21] now i'm not saying god can't pick me up
[52:23] once or twice and maybe annoy me to sing
[52:24] this special maybe i'll do it next week
[52:25] just to prove that it can i don't know
[52:27] but i'm saying my regular calling my
[52:29] regular duty my regularly my regular
[52:31] purpose it's not to lay before god for
[52:34] songs and for anoint to singing it's to
[52:36] lay before god for inspiration out of
[52:38] the word to teach and to preach
[52:40] that's what comes naturally to me i'm an
[52:42] analytical person
[52:44] why would it be unnatural for me to
[52:46] teach out of the scripture
[52:48] brother branham was wired that way he
[52:50] would have a complex and a meltdown
[52:52] because his gun wouldn't shoot right he
[52:54] would be out in the woods hunting
[52:56] squirrels and bawling like a baby
[52:57] because his gun won't drive tax and god
[53:00] says i made you that way so you wouldn't
[53:02] compromise on the word
[53:04] it's really that simple saints i would
[53:08] encourage you that if you found yourself
[53:09] in a complex or worked up about
[53:11] something or trying to push yourself or
[53:13] make something happen chances are it's
[53:15] not your position
[53:18] because god's gifts always find their
[53:19] places
[53:20] and it works
[53:22] you don't have to make it work remember
[53:23] it's god's gifts
[53:26] and don't don't get hung up on that when
[53:29] and when i say gifts it's not minutes
[53:31] just ministry gifts
[53:34] it's positions in the body
[53:36] it's your spiritual position in christ
[53:38] it's not just a five-fold ministry so
[53:40] you don't have an easy out there you
[53:41] can't say oh i'm not a minister that
[53:43] don't apply to me no it applies to you
[53:45] maybe the only reason that i can get up
[53:46] here and go for an hour an hour and a
[53:48] half two hours three hours whatever we
[53:49] end up at tonight is because somebody
[53:51] prayed about it
[53:52] maybe somebody fasted about it
[53:54] i don't know
[53:57] i don't i don't know
[53:59] whatever it is whatever god has in place
[54:01] to make it work i sure don't want it to
[54:04] stop though because i don't want to be
[54:05] the preaching is foolishness enough let
[54:08] alone when you're up here and you ain't
[54:08] got nothing to say
[54:11] or you can't pick up any inspiration out
[54:13] of the word i don't know maybe somebody
[54:15] was praying six weeks ago when this
[54:17] inspiration started maybe somebody was
[54:19] praying and fasting
[54:21] six weeks ago when brother chad was
[54:23] preaching that and i picked this out of
[54:25] that quote and it just struck with me
[54:26] and inspiration went
[54:28] we don't know maybe it was a year ago
[54:30] we don't know how all the intricate
[54:33] details work and brother branham says
[54:35] it's not our place to know don't worry
[54:36] about it
[54:38] find your purpose be glad in it and stay
[54:41] in it
[54:42] don't deviate away from it because if
[54:44] you deviate away from it you're on a
[54:45] white horse
[54:50] you wonder why you see so many
[54:52] ministries fall off the ledge into just
[54:54] sin and immorality
[54:59] not just pulpit ministries ministries
[55:02] one day they're standing for christ
[55:04] proclaiming it boldly next thing you
[55:06] know they're a homosexual or whatever
[55:08] else
[55:09] is because they got on a white horse and
[55:11] got in a position or a purpose that
[55:13] wasn't theirs
[55:15] and they wouldn't repent so they ended
[55:17] up defending that position on the red
[55:18] horse
[55:19] you all know the pattern i don't need to
[55:20] continue
[55:21] that pattern will not fail it won't fail
[55:24] for you and it won't fail for me
[55:26] it doesn't ever fail
[55:30] out of position you're on a white horse
[55:33] you better repent because if not
[55:36] you're not going to stay on that horse
[55:37] for very long
[55:38] that pattern will not fail
[55:41] so just relax be comfortable in what god
[55:43] has called you to do be comfortable in
[55:45] what god has given you naturally
[55:48] brother branham says most of the time
[55:51] people who have gifts don't even know
[55:53] they have the gift but it's p it's easy
[55:55] for other people to recognize it it's
[55:57] because they just see it and it's well
[55:59] that person just does that naturally
[56:01] but it's a gift
[56:03] they're not necessarily trying because
[56:05] it's god anointing that gift they don't
[56:06] have to try
[56:08] i would be worried about something you
[56:10] have to try to do for god
[56:14] if you're trying to do it i would be
[56:17] worried i would be i would be concerned
[56:19] because if there's not an anointing that
[56:21] just makes it work something's out of
[56:24] place
[56:26] something's not right
[56:28] the holy spirit flows brother bran says
[56:29] the holy spirit is timid
[56:32] the holy spirit is not going to come
[56:33] down and just shove something in
[56:35] the holy spirit is going to flow it's
[56:38] going to work it's going to fit it's
[56:40] going to be natural
[56:42] even if somebody else is attacking that
[56:44] and trying to make it deviate or trying
[56:46] to take your place
[56:49] or trying to take away from your purpose
[56:51] god will deal with that
[56:53] if it's god's gift he's given it for a
[56:55] purpose
[56:57] he's not just going to throw it out
[56:58] there for randomly
[57:00] if he's given a gift it's for a purpose
[57:04] he's going to make sure that it finds
[57:05] its place
[57:07] you don't have to do that
[57:10] relax in that 1962 remember remembering
[57:14] the lord there has to be a creator if
[57:16] there is a creation and if there is a
[57:17] creation it was made by a creator and
[57:19] any man's work reflects himself if he's
[57:22] a good carpenter he does good work he
[57:24] builds and if he's a good mechanic he
[57:26] does good work your work only reflects
[57:28] you
[57:30] remember what i just said why is god
[57:33] going to do work to give a gift and it
[57:34] not work
[57:36] now he's not a good worker
[57:38] it's not going to be the case with god
[57:41] maybe you or me but not with god
[57:44] his work is you and me he's going to
[57:46] make sure it works right
[57:48] and god's creation reflects god and god
[57:51] made everything for a purpose and
[57:53] everything that serves the purpose
[57:56] of god's purpose
[57:58] when it does
[58:00] it has a resurrection
[58:03] if you serve god's purpose
[58:06] then you have a resurrection
[58:08] if you don't serve god's purpose
[58:11] guess what you don't have
[58:14] why is that because if you don't serve
[58:16] his purpose your name is scratched off
[58:18] the
[58:20] book if you do something that
[58:23] is not his purpose for your life
[58:27] you're adding to your name is scratched
[58:29] off the book
[58:30] you weren't in his thoughts no true
[58:33] believer that was in his thoughts
[58:35] an eternal being can be scratched off
[58:38] that book they're not going to find
[58:40] themselves in a place that they can't
[58:41] repent and get out of that look i don't
[58:44] belong here this is not working this is
[58:45] not right this ain't flowing
[58:49] don't think pulpit ministry when i'm
[58:51] saying that saints individual lives
[58:54] if you're seeking a job
[58:57] and it just ain't happening like you're
[58:59] wanting this job and it's not working
[59:01] and you can't get it no matter how hard
[59:03] you try i would say quit trying
[59:06] if you're trying to buy this here and
[59:08] you just can't get enough money for it
[59:10] it's not working i would say quit trying
[59:12] to buy it
[59:15] do you understand the principle do you
[59:16] understand what i'm after don't
[59:18] it can be carnal too
[59:20] we want to apply the spiritual to the
[59:22] spiritual position but it can be very
[59:23] carnal as well
[59:27] how many people are seeking after a
[59:29] career that's not their career how many
[59:32] people are seeking after material goods
[59:34] that's not their material goods how many
[59:36] people are seeking after an
[59:37] entertainment or something some type of
[59:39] hobby or something that's not flowing
[59:41] it's not working they're having to make
[59:43] it happen
[59:48] you all know me well enough to know that
[59:50] i
[59:51] have nothing against hard work
[59:53] i'm not saying you just said around oh
[59:55] whatever god have yep if it works it'll
[59:57] work you know i'll just sit here and if
[1:00:00] the bills need paid they'll get paid you
[1:00:02] understand you can go off on either side
[1:00:03] with fanaticism
[1:00:06] i'm saying be spiritual and pray about
[1:00:07] it and really discern
[1:00:10] really discern
[1:00:12] and be honest with yourself because at
[1:00:15] the end of the day you may fool me
[1:00:17] you may fool your brother and sister you
[1:00:19] may fool your family but at the end of
[1:00:21] the day
[1:00:22] can you look yourself in the eye in the
[1:00:24] mirror and say my heart is pure
[1:00:28] i'm not trying to make this happen
[1:00:31] i'm not trying to force it this is what
[1:00:33] god is doing
[1:00:34] or
[1:00:35] this is what god is not doing
[1:00:40] that's what matters at the end of the
[1:00:41] day
[1:00:43] is if you can answer that question it
[1:00:44] doesn't matter what i think or what
[1:00:45] anybody else is thinking
[1:00:47] if you can answer that question
[1:00:51] you're in the words of the book
[1:00:53] heavens and earth will pass away but
[1:00:56] that will not pass away
[1:01:00] let's go to ephesians 4.
[1:01:05] if you'll bear with me to go through
[1:01:06] this we'll
[1:01:08] put a bow on this and be done with it
[1:01:13] notice i did not put a time limit on
[1:01:15] that
[1:01:17] just kidding i remember it's wednesday
[1:01:19] night and there's people here that's
[1:01:20] worked
[1:01:23] ephesians 4
[1:01:30] i therefore the prisoner of the lord
[1:01:33] beseech you that you walk worthy
[1:01:36] of the vocation wherewith you're called
[1:01:39] i would say another word for vocation is
[1:01:41] purpose
[1:01:43] walk worthy of the purpose
[1:01:46] wherewith you're called
[1:01:50] notice how he then tells you to walk
[1:01:53] with all lowliness
[1:01:55] and meekness
[1:01:57] with long suffering
[1:01:59] forbearing one another in love
[1:02:04] how can he say that
[1:02:06] is because paul knows the principle
[1:02:08] that if you have a relevant if you have
[1:02:11] a revelation of the purpose or the
[1:02:14] vocation that you were called and you
[1:02:16] cannot proceed with lowliness and
[1:02:19] meekness chances are it's not your
[1:02:21] position and that's not your purpose
[1:02:25] because if i have a revelation
[1:02:27] that god has called me let's just use
[1:02:30] this because this is simple if i have a
[1:02:32] revelation that god has called me to
[1:02:34] stand here and to preach and i do
[1:02:37] what does it matter what anybody else's
[1:02:39] say
[1:02:40] says or does about that
[1:02:44] if he has called me what can you do to
[1:02:46] remove me from this position
[1:02:49] he said heavens and earth will pass away
[1:02:50] but that won't pass away
[1:02:55] that's good for you too
[1:02:57] whatever position capacity gift calling
[1:03:00] that you're in
[1:03:03] if it wasn't for that i would never
[1:03:06] stand here
[1:03:07] you would be
[1:03:09] foolish
[1:03:10] to stand here
[1:03:12] because i am going to be held
[1:03:14] accountable for every word that i say
[1:03:16] here
[1:03:16] and people's eternal destination is
[1:03:18] going to be based on that and i'm going
[1:03:20] to be judged on that
[1:03:24] why
[1:03:24] would anybody in their right mind say
[1:03:27] i'll go and do that the only
[1:03:31] real reason that somebody will do that
[1:03:33] there's two reasons somebody will do
[1:03:35] that
[1:03:36] number one they don't have a revelation
[1:03:38] of what we just discussed and they'll do
[1:03:40] it for pride and popularity
[1:03:42] or they have a revelation that that is
[1:03:46] their calling and their purpose and if
[1:03:47] they don't do that
[1:03:50] they're taking away from the words of
[1:03:51] the book
[1:03:53] so it's a catch-22
[1:03:55] your foolishness you're foolish if you
[1:03:58] do it that's scriptural the foolishness
[1:04:00] of preaching it's scriptural i'm here to
[1:04:02] make a form out of myself
[1:04:05] i probably do a pretty good job of that
[1:04:08] but i would rather come here and be
[1:04:09] foolish and make a fool out of myself
[1:04:12] than have my name stretched off the book
[1:04:15] because when the revelation of your
[1:04:17] purpose comes
[1:04:19] a true revelation i'm not talking about
[1:04:21] a whim
[1:04:23] or something frivolous i'm talking about
[1:04:24] a true revelation
[1:04:27] and you don't do that
[1:04:30] you're not going to sleep at night
[1:04:32] you're going to need xanax
[1:04:34] you're going to need a house with the
[1:04:36] padded walls
[1:04:38] if you're a real true genuine seed of
[1:04:40] god
[1:04:42] the same way you say well how can you
[1:04:44] say that you don't know that yeah i can
[1:04:47] because the same way somebody would come
[1:04:49] and they would preach something
[1:04:50] different than what you know to be true
[1:04:52] and hear
[1:04:53] nervous do you get
[1:04:56] how unsettled do you start feeling
[1:05:00] how easy it is it to swallow it down
[1:05:03] you can't once you know the truth like
[1:05:06] if somebody was to come and tell you
[1:05:07] that the white horse rider was god
[1:05:09] himself going out and combating
[1:05:11] everything
[1:05:12] are you going to stand for that
[1:05:14] are you going to rest easy on that
[1:05:17] are you going to be able to swallow that
[1:05:18] down no because you know the truth it's
[1:05:20] undeniable it's already been revealed to
[1:05:22] you that's the antichrist spirit going
[1:05:23] forward
[1:05:27] it's that same
[1:05:28] confidence it's that same revelation
[1:05:31] that we have to have
[1:05:33] in our daily life and our calling and
[1:05:35] our purpose
[1:05:37] because if not we're going to find
[1:05:39] ourselves causing god trouble and our
[1:05:41] self trouble
[1:05:43] but once you do find that
[1:05:45] rest in that
[1:05:47] be comfortable in that
[1:05:49] that's why this is just me talking i
[1:05:51] don't know why i'm talking but that's
[1:05:52] why i'm su when i see a minister come to
[1:05:54] the pulpit and he's super nervous
[1:05:56] i get super nervous
[1:06:00] why is that
[1:06:01] because if he's super nervous now i'm
[1:06:02] not talking about butterflies you would
[1:06:04] be silly if you didn't have butterflies
[1:06:05] but i'm talking like nervous like they
[1:06:07] can't do nothing they're so nervous
[1:06:09] when i see that
[1:06:11] it makes me question the revelation of
[1:06:13] being there because you've got to have a
[1:06:15] revelation to come there brother branham
[1:06:16] said that i didn't say that he said you
[1:06:17] better meet god face to face the pillar
[1:06:19] of fire on the backside of the desert
[1:06:21] before you stand there you have to have
[1:06:22] that or you've got no business standing
[1:06:24] there
[1:06:25] so if they haven't got that revelation
[1:06:27] to the fact that they're so nervous they
[1:06:29] can't come here and they know
[1:06:31] this is my position and i can't make it
[1:06:34] happen
[1:06:36] i can't force this i cannot come here
[1:06:39] and break the word
[1:06:41] he has got to come and do it remember
[1:06:43] brother branham says the gift was to
[1:06:45] relax
[1:06:46] and let him do it
[1:06:51] that's why i can come to the pulpit and
[1:06:53] i'm not nervous not now don't get me
[1:06:54] wrong like i said we're not talking
[1:06:56] butterfly nervous we're talking
[1:06:58] nervous to the point i don't know what's
[1:07:00] going to happen i don't know if he's
[1:07:01] going to be there i don't know if this
[1:07:03] will work
[1:07:07] that would mean that i don't have a
[1:07:08] proper revelation as the prophet told me
[1:07:10] i needed to even stand here
[1:07:13] now let's quit talking about me because
[1:07:15] i don't like talking about me and let's
[1:07:16] talk about you
[1:07:19] it's not just a ministry a pulpit
[1:07:21] ministry that we're dealing with saints
[1:07:23] it's you
[1:07:25] can you go to work
[1:07:27] each and every day
[1:07:29] confident this is where he's placed me
[1:07:33] because if you can't do not expect any
[1:07:35] fruit from that
[1:07:38] if you cannot go there as thus saith the
[1:07:40] lord he has placed me here
[1:07:42] for a purpose for a reason for something
[1:07:46] how can there be fruit from that the
[1:07:48] scripture says that which is not done in
[1:07:49] faith is is sin
[1:07:53] you say well that's real simple that's
[1:07:54] real elementary i'm just trying to pay
[1:07:56] my bills that's fine i get that but god
[1:07:58] will take this little thing over here of
[1:08:00] a problem that you need to pay your
[1:08:02] bills
[1:08:03] and then create a position over here to
[1:08:05] allow you to pay your bills and still
[1:08:07] allow his spiritual kingdom to move
[1:08:08] forward and it will work
[1:08:11] and it will work
[1:08:13] and if you find yourself having to force
[1:08:15] the issue or if you find yourself
[1:08:17] grasping for a position that's just out
[1:08:20] of reach
[1:08:22] i would say check that i would say pray
[1:08:24] about that
[1:08:26] because if it's you trying to make it
[1:08:29] work or you trying to do it you're
[1:08:32] already off the mark and there cannot be
[1:08:34] fruit from that but if you have the
[1:08:36] revelation that he has called me and he
[1:08:38] has placed me here
[1:08:39] i don't care if you're making two
[1:08:41] dollars an hour
[1:08:43] or 500 an hour he's going to pay your
[1:08:46] bills and you're going to see fruit
[1:08:48] [Music]
[1:08:51] so
[1:08:52] we understand the the importance of
[1:08:55] ministry and the breaking of the word
[1:08:56] and the the position to stand here
[1:09:01] but remember
[1:09:02] that's
[1:09:04] the same importance is on your daily
[1:09:06] life
[1:09:08] this is just an example that we can talk
[1:09:10] about because it's easy to talk about
[1:09:11] and it's easy to show and we would all
[1:09:12] agree on that we wouldn't want somebody
[1:09:14] just to come here previously
[1:09:18] but why would we conduct our daily lives
[1:09:21] the words in the book
[1:09:24] with any less
[1:09:26] preeminence and importance
[1:09:33] paul says
[1:09:34] walk
[1:09:36] worthy of the vocation wherewith you
[1:09:38] were called with lowliness and meekness
[1:09:41] with long-suffering forbearing one
[1:09:43] another in love i went off on a tangent
[1:09:45] i forgot what i was originally going to
[1:09:47] say the reason paul can say this
[1:09:50] that you can walk with loneliness and
[1:09:52] meekness is because if that's revealed
[1:09:54] to you
[1:09:55] you don't have to make it work
[1:09:57] and you don't have to worry about
[1:09:58] protecting it
[1:10:01] if god has placed you in that job
[1:10:05] why do you need to be worried about you
[1:10:07] getting fired
[1:10:14] if god has allowed you this capacity to
[1:10:18] pay your bills
[1:10:20] and these are not bills that you just
[1:10:21] went out and got because of ridiculous
[1:10:23] behavior
[1:10:25] and doing silly stuff you understand
[1:10:27] what i'm talking
[1:10:28] about if
[1:10:30] god god is he says i've not seen my
[1:10:33] righteous forsaken god is going to pay
[1:10:35] your bills and if he's created this
[1:10:37] position to allow you to do it why are
[1:10:38] you worried that he's going to take that
[1:10:40] position away from you
[1:10:41] there is no man in the world that can
[1:10:43] take that position away from you
[1:10:45] it's impossible
[1:10:48] now if you've put yourself there
[1:10:51] i would probably start putting your
[1:10:52] applications in somewhere else
[1:10:55] because it'll crumble
[1:10:59] i know that's really simple
[1:11:02] but if we will take that same principle
[1:11:04] and apply it carnally and spiritually
[1:11:07] the kingdom of god will grow and there
[1:11:10] will be fruit from it
[1:11:12] and we can move forward with faith not
[1:11:15] fear
[1:11:16] not worrying if it's going to work
[1:11:19] does that make sense
[1:11:20] [Music]
[1:11:23] so we don't have to worry about moving
[1:11:25] forward pridefully or forcefully we can
[1:11:28] move forward with lowliness
[1:11:30] and meekness because if i'm in this
[1:11:32] position and i'm not and i'm called to
[1:11:35] be in this position there's nobody can
[1:11:36] move me from it
[1:11:38] but if i'm in this position and somebody
[1:11:40] can remove me from it or some external
[1:11:42] force can remove me from it i say thank
[1:11:44] god i clearly wasn't supposed to be in
[1:11:46] that position whatever that position is
[1:11:48] i'm not talking about ministry and
[1:11:49] preaching now whatever that position is
[1:11:52] if you can be moved
[1:11:54] that means you probably weren't supposed
[1:11:55] to be there to begin with
[1:11:59] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[1:12:00] words will not pass away
[1:12:03] my words will not be moved now it
[1:12:05] doesn't ever mean that you can't switch
[1:12:07] jobs
[1:12:09] it doesn't ever mean that you might have
[1:12:11] to work some overtime to pay some bills
[1:12:13] you understand
[1:12:15] you can get fanatical with it but that's
[1:12:17] not what we're after we're after staying
[1:12:18] in the middle of the road we're after
[1:12:21] seeking god for revelation
[1:12:24] that's what we're after
[1:12:25] [Music]
[1:12:26] so that was ephesians 4 1 and 2.
[1:12:30] but i want to
[1:12:32] go you don't have to turn there you can
[1:12:33] just listen it's very familiar you'll
[1:12:35] know where we're going but i want to
[1:12:38] inject john 13 into this right here
[1:12:40] because it's applicable
[1:12:42] paul says walk worth worthy of the
[1:12:44] vocation where you wherein you are
[1:12:46] called with all loneliness and meekness
[1:12:50] now let's look at jesus
[1:12:53] now before the feast of the passover
[1:12:54] when jesus knew that his hours was come
[1:12:56] that he should depart out of this world
[1:12:58] unto the father
[1:13:00] having loved his own which were in the
[1:13:01] world he loved them until the end and
[1:13:03] supper being ended the devil having put
[1:13:06] into the heart of judah security
[1:13:08] simon's son to betray him
[1:13:11] jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:13:13] all things into his hands and that he
[1:13:15] was come from god and went to god
[1:13:18] he rises from supper and lay aside his
[1:13:21] garments and took a towel and girded
[1:13:23] himself and after that he poureth water
[1:13:25] into a base and began to wash the
[1:13:27] disciples feet and to wipe them with the
[1:13:29] towel with he was
[1:13:30] girded but unto every one of us i'm
[1:13:34] sorry
[1:13:35] that's verse seven
[1:13:37] in ephesians
[1:13:39] so we can see
[1:13:42] jesus
[1:13:44] i would say coming to the perfection of
[1:13:46] his ministry
[1:13:48] the seventh seal being revealed
[1:13:51] god on earth
[1:13:55] god in the form of flesh
[1:13:58] the same pattern that we're now walking
[1:14:00] in
[1:14:00] he came to a point a perfection in his
[1:14:03] ministry that he knew he came from god
[1:14:05] and he knew he was going to god
[1:14:08] and he did not have to force the issue
[1:14:11] because now he could come and he could
[1:14:13] wash his disciples feet
[1:14:15] and he didn't have to worry that
[1:14:16] somebody would say well that is god in
[1:14:18] flesh
[1:14:19] i thought he was the one supposed to be
[1:14:20] being worshipped i thought he was the
[1:14:22] one supposed to be getting his feet
[1:14:24] washed
[1:14:25] you know this
[1:14:26] i don't know if he's in that position i
[1:14:28] don't know if that's really him or not
[1:14:32] there was one man that thought that
[1:14:36] that's what brother branham said
[1:14:38] he says that's why judas betrayed him
[1:14:41] he says he just couldn't see him being
[1:14:43] the son of god because of his humility
[1:14:46] he would see him hungry he would see him
[1:14:48] thirsty he would see him bowing down to
[1:14:50] others to wash their feet he just
[1:14:52] couldn't think that that was the son of
[1:14:54] god
[1:14:58] the principle applies
[1:15:01] if we have i don't know of a greater
[1:15:03] revelation that you can have that you
[1:15:05] came from god and you're going to god
[1:15:07] i would venture to say that that would
[1:15:10] be perfect faith
[1:15:15] but if that revelation produces
[1:15:18] something other than lowliness and
[1:15:20] meekness
[1:15:22] and the ability to submit yourselves to
[1:15:25] your brothers and sisters
[1:15:27] i would venture to say you really don't
[1:15:28] have that revelation
[1:15:30] [Music]
[1:15:33] and i would venture to say that any
[1:15:34] complex that you would have that you
[1:15:36] would have to build up
[1:15:38] your calling or build up your ministry
[1:15:41] or build yourself up in any capacity
[1:15:44] to defend this position or this calling
[1:15:48] i would say that doesn't match the words
[1:15:50] in the book
[1:15:53] because jesus knowing
[1:15:56] that he came from god
[1:15:59] and knowing that he was going to god
[1:16:01] amen
[1:16:04] i'm going to take a towel and wash my
[1:16:05] disciples feet
[1:16:08] i'm not concerned about what people's
[1:16:09] going to say about my position
[1:16:12] he knew he came from god and he knew he
[1:16:15] was going to god
[1:16:18] why do why would he care
[1:16:21] what anybody else said
[1:16:23] or believed or thought or degraded
[1:16:29] why should we
[1:16:32] if we have that revelation
[1:16:34] now if you don't
[1:16:35] and you're trying to defend something i
[1:16:37] would be concerned
[1:16:39] but if you have that proper revelation
[1:16:42] and understand it's not that we conduct
[1:16:44] ourself in any way
[1:16:46] that we just want to and we don't care
[1:16:48] we're the bride
[1:16:49] paul says don't do anything that'll
[1:16:50] stumble your brother
[1:16:52] but i'm saying to rest in that
[1:16:55] why do we feel the need to defend or to
[1:16:59] fight or protect or to build up
[1:17:02] if this is my purpose in life and it is
[1:17:05] equivalent to the words in the book and
[1:17:07] heaven and earth that's going to pass
[1:17:08] away but this position is not going to
[1:17:10] this purpose is not going to this
[1:17:12] calling is not going to
[1:17:15] what is hybrid me going to do to defend
[1:17:18] it
[1:17:19] like if god can't defend it
[1:17:24] what am i going to do to defend it
[1:17:27] and furthermore why should i be defended
[1:17:34] picking back up in verse 11 of ephesians
[1:17:36] 4.
[1:17:39] or i'm sorry verse 7
[1:17:41] but unto every one of us has given grace
[1:17:43] according to the measure of the gift of
[1:17:46] christ
[1:17:47] now to verse 11. and he gave some
[1:17:49] apostles and some prophets and some of
[1:17:51] angels and some pastors and some
[1:17:53] teachers you say you're talking about
[1:17:54] the ministry again that's five fold
[1:17:56] ministries pulpit ministries ministries
[1:17:57] and in the church behind the pulpit yes
[1:17:59] that's true but think about this for a
[1:18:01] second
[1:18:02] do you think for a second
[1:18:06] that evangelist is going to be
[1:18:10] um what's the word that i'm looking for
[1:18:12] that an evangelist is going to be is
[1:18:16] going to have good results
[1:18:18] if he doesn't even know who his pastor
[1:18:19] is
[1:18:23] like i'm storming the world saving souls
[1:18:26] for christ who's your pastor uh
[1:18:28] [Music]
[1:18:30] don't know
[1:18:31] get back to you on that
[1:18:36] that's like
[1:18:38] the infantryman
[1:18:39] going out to battle
[1:18:41] to save the world
[1:18:43] and he has no general orders or know who
[1:18:45] his captain is
[1:18:47] what's he going to do he's going to
[1:18:49] cause his captain and himself a lot of
[1:18:50] trouble
[1:18:54] okay i think you caught that
[1:18:56] it's just going to cause trouble
[1:19:01] he gave some of prophets evangelists
[1:19:03] pastors and teachers brother brennan
[1:19:05] says even a teacher he says you take a
[1:19:06] real good teacher he says he still has
[1:19:08] to have a pastor because he's on thin
[1:19:10] ice to begin with
[1:19:12] and he has to have a pastor to keep him
[1:19:14] on the straight and narrow because a
[1:19:15] teacher can get so wound up into the
[1:19:17] spirit and so wound up into the
[1:19:18] scriptures that he can start seeing
[1:19:20] things
[1:19:22] a lot of things
[1:19:25] some of them which don't exist
[1:19:29] but his principle will be true
[1:19:31] but brother branham says you can go to
[1:19:32] seed on some of those types and shadows
[1:19:34] and be wrong
[1:19:36] he says a true genuine teacher still has
[1:19:39] to set under a pastor
[1:19:41] to keep him in line
[1:19:43] same thing for an apostle or a prophet
[1:19:45] we know a word prophet is above all that
[1:19:47] but the five-fold ministry of
[1:19:48] you know a what we would term as a minor
[1:19:50] prophet under that
[1:19:52] brother bran says the pastor is the
[1:19:55] i'm going to get this wrong but he is
[1:19:57] the most powerful position at the local
[1:19:59] assembly the highest position
[1:20:01] we know god has ordained that he's
[1:20:03] purposed that any of these positions
[1:20:05] that would go around that i would
[1:20:07] question
[1:20:08] he says
[1:20:10] but what i want to get to here as well
[1:20:12] is that's just ministering
[1:20:15] but let's think for a second
[1:20:18] we would acknowledge the position of a
[1:20:19] pastor
[1:20:20] but a pastor will come here to the
[1:20:22] pulpit and what if he didn't have
[1:20:23] musicians to set an atmosphere
[1:20:27] how much fun would that be
[1:20:30] then i would have to come and sing a
[1:20:31] solo
[1:20:32] and a special
[1:20:34] and now nobody's going to hear a word
[1:20:36] that i said if you're even still here
[1:20:40] or the pastor or whoever else he can
[1:20:41] sing a solo if he wants to
[1:20:45] do you understand what i'm saying you
[1:20:46] say well god placed those there
[1:20:48] look
[1:20:49] at the positions under those that have
[1:20:51] to be there
[1:20:52] maybe it is his position to stand here
[1:20:54] and to preach and to govern their local
[1:20:56] body but what is supporting that
[1:21:01] what if those people just say well
[1:21:03] because i can't come and preach or
[1:21:04] because i'm not a pastor i'm just going
[1:21:06] to hang it up
[1:21:07] we would have a dirty church
[1:21:11] if we had a
[1:21:12] church we would have a poor atmosphere
[1:21:17] and the word would not go forth and be
[1:21:19] effective
[1:21:20] that's the word i was looking for a
[1:21:21] little while ago about the evangelist he
[1:21:22] wouldn't be effective
[1:21:25] it wouldn't work saints so when we read
[1:21:29] this scripture don't leave it behind the
[1:21:31] pulpit he gave gifts unto men but unto
[1:21:35] every one of us
[1:21:37] unto every one of us is given grace
[1:21:40] according to the measure of the gift of
[1:21:41] christ
[1:21:43] and he gave some
[1:21:45] not all he gave some
[1:21:47] apostles prophets some evangelists some
[1:21:49] pastors some teachers
[1:21:52] we're coming to a close i promise just
[1:21:54] stay with me musicians come now you know
[1:21:56] that i'm serious
[1:21:59] i've went slow for a purpose it would be
[1:22:01] really easy for me to get wound up and
[1:22:03] and preach this but i went slow for a
[1:22:05] purpose
[1:22:06] because i want you to catch what i'm
[1:22:08] saying even if i've said it 300 times
[1:22:10] like when you walk out of here you're
[1:22:11] not going to have an excuse you know
[1:22:12] what i've said
[1:22:15] and trust me it's not been easy like
[1:22:16] there's some of these things that i
[1:22:17] really want to preach on i might do a
[1:22:18] part three because i really want to
[1:22:19] preach them because it would be fun
[1:22:22] but i want you to hear what i'm saying
[1:22:27] when israel went out to battle
[1:22:31] not everybody went to battle
[1:22:35] you understand
[1:22:36] he gave some
[1:22:39] to go to battle
[1:22:42] when israel went to battle there was
[1:22:44] only a select group that went to battle
[1:22:48] but when they came back with the spoils
[1:22:51] guess who all got the spoils
[1:22:56] yes it really is that simple
[1:23:02] i would probably no i wouldn't i know my
[1:23:04] nature but i was going to say i would
[1:23:06] rather be working in the kitchen and let
[1:23:07] somebody else go through the fighting
[1:23:08] but i couldn't do that because that's
[1:23:09] not my nature
[1:23:11] but it would be a lot safer and it'd
[1:23:12] make a hot it would make a lot more
[1:23:13] sense
[1:23:15] but i guarantee you the potato pillar
[1:23:18] was not sad
[1:23:20] when they came back with all the spoils
[1:23:22] and he got to partake of them
[1:23:24] he was not sad that he didn't get to go
[1:23:26] out that day and take a knife into the
[1:23:27] side
[1:23:28] like he wasn't upset about that he was
[1:23:30] happy he was pilling potatoes
[1:23:33] because that's what his calling was
[1:23:34] that's what his purpose was but there
[1:23:36] were some
[1:23:38] that had to go to the battle
[1:23:41] you don't want a potato pillow pillar at
[1:23:44] the battle
[1:23:47] unless you don't want your nation to
[1:23:48] stand anymore
[1:23:50] and i know these are some laughable
[1:23:52] analogies
[1:23:54] but it's just as laughable when one
[1:23:56] member of the body of christ tries to
[1:23:57] take another member position
[1:24:00] or if they get out of position it's just
[1:24:02] as laughable like you may not be able to
[1:24:04] see it but everybody else can and it's
[1:24:06] laughable the same as it would be the mr
[1:24:08] potato pillar out there
[1:24:10] trying to fend off the philistines
[1:24:13] it's not going to last
[1:24:14] not very long it's not going to work and
[1:24:17] furthermore
[1:24:19] if i'm the other potato pillar
[1:24:21] and i'm not getting any spoils
[1:24:23] to pay my bills because this guy got out
[1:24:26] of position and went to the battle and
[1:24:27] lost
[1:24:29] i'm not going to be happy
[1:24:31] so now it's detrimental to everybody
[1:24:33] else too
[1:24:38] he gave some apostles some prophets some
[1:24:41] evangelists some pastors some teachers
[1:24:45] and he gave others
[1:24:48] positions under those
[1:24:50] to make sure they work
[1:24:53] those positions are not going to work
[1:24:55] without me and you
[1:24:57] underneath of them
[1:24:58] how much fun would it be to stand here
[1:25:00] and preach and nobody say amen
[1:25:03] nobody to pull on the word
[1:25:06] i wouldn't be able to preach if nobody
[1:25:07] pulled on the word been there done that
[1:25:09] never do it again
[1:25:10] i'll read through my notes and i'll
[1:25:11] close the service
[1:25:13] i can't preach unless somebody pulls
[1:25:15] like i can't make this work
[1:25:17] i've stood here for
[1:25:18] an hour and 20 minutes now praise the
[1:25:20] lord
[1:25:22] i would have been here literally for 15
[1:25:24] minutes if somebody was not pulling on
[1:25:26] the word you can't make it work
[1:25:29] like you can't fake it you just can't it
[1:25:31] either works or it don't work
[1:25:33] and it's real obvious when it works and
[1:25:35] when it don't work
[1:25:37] because it's if a man gets behind it and
[1:25:40] it's forcing it it's just uncomfortable
[1:25:44] that's good on the small picture that's
[1:25:45] good on the big picture
[1:25:51] verse 12 for the perfecting of the
[1:25:52] saints for the work of the ministry for
[1:25:54] the edifying of the body of christ
[1:25:57] if your position
[1:25:59] your calling what god has revealed to
[1:26:01] you
[1:26:02] is not
[1:26:03] working towards the perfecting of the
[1:26:05] saints for the work of the ministry and
[1:26:07] for the edifying of the body of christ i
[1:26:10] would be real concerned about what
[1:26:12] you're doing
[1:26:13] or what you're not doing
[1:26:17] till we all come into the unity of the
[1:26:18] faith and the knowledge of the son of
[1:26:20] god and to a perfect man into the
[1:26:21] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:26:23] of christ
[1:26:24] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:26:28] toss to and fro
[1:26:30] see children just do whatever they want
[1:26:32] if you don't believe that come to my
[1:26:33] house
[1:26:34] they don't they don't have a purpose
[1:26:35] they don't have a clear line of thought
[1:26:37] it's just whatever comes toys whatever
[1:26:39] play fish it's just whatever comes along
[1:26:42] that's what i want you understand what
[1:26:43] i'm saying
[1:26:44] but when you come to a level of maturity
[1:26:47] you get up and your day is maybe
[1:26:49] scheduled
[1:26:51] like there are certain things you have
[1:26:52] to do there's certain roles you have to
[1:26:54] fulfill if you want to keep moving
[1:26:56] forward in society
[1:26:58] and not in an evil way i'm not saying
[1:26:59] like climb the ladder or moving forward
[1:27:01] i'm just saying if you want to have a
[1:27:03] roof over your head and food to eat
[1:27:05] there's certain things if you want to
[1:27:07] feed your children who don't care what
[1:27:09] they're doing and just want to play and
[1:27:10] fish
[1:27:12] there are certain things that have to be
[1:27:13] done
[1:27:15] paul says don't be like little children
[1:27:17] be focused
[1:27:19] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:27:21] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[1:27:23] every wind of doctrine by the slight of
[1:27:25] men and cunning craftiness whereby they
[1:27:27] lay in wait to deceive but speaking the
[1:27:29] truth in love may great grow up unto him
[1:27:32] and through all things which is the head
[1:27:34] even christ from whom the whole body
[1:27:36] fitly joint together and compacted by
[1:27:39] that which every joy supplyeth according
[1:27:41] to the effectual working and the measure
[1:27:43] of every part maketh increase of the
[1:27:45] body and to the edifying of itself in
[1:27:47] love
[1:27:48] this i say therefore and testify in the
[1:27:51] lord
[1:27:52] that ye henceforth this is the part that
[1:27:54] i want to lay emphasis on that ye
[1:27:56] henceforth walk not as other gentiles
[1:28:00] walk in the vanity of their mind
[1:28:04] paul is saying do not have a spiritual
[1:28:08] religious life that is equivalent to
[1:28:10] that which other gentiles have
[1:28:13] that ye walk not as other gentiles walk
[1:28:19] so if we don't want to walk as other
[1:28:21] gentiles walk we probably should
[1:28:24] ascertain how they walk and make sure
[1:28:26] we're not doing that so how do other
[1:28:28] gentiles walk
[1:28:29] if they have an inkling of a spiritual
[1:28:33] desire or a religious desire they go and
[1:28:36] they find a church
[1:28:38] that they agree with the doctrine
[1:28:43] and they join it
[1:28:46] and they go there wednesday and sunday
[1:28:47] maybe
[1:28:49] and they say i'm a member of this and
[1:28:50] this is what i believe
[1:28:54] don't leave that out there
[1:28:58] paul says don't walk as other gentiles
[1:29:00] walk
[1:29:02] find a doctrine that i believe in
[1:29:04] a church i can fellowship in
[1:29:07] one that my lifestyle will fit
[1:29:11] you understand what i'm saying paul says
[1:29:13] don't walk as other gentiles walk
[1:29:15] as other religious gentiles walk i would
[1:29:17] say
[1:29:19] as church goers walk gentiles
[1:29:23] don't do that
[1:29:26] don't just go find whatever doctrine you
[1:29:28] can agree with
[1:29:29] it's good you should agree with your
[1:29:30] doctrine
[1:29:31] don't just go ever find whatever church
[1:29:34] that you can
[1:29:35] have
[1:29:36] a good fellowship with that's good you
[1:29:38] should have that i would say there's a
[1:29:40] problem if you don't
[1:29:42] but paul is saying just don't have a
[1:29:44] church life
[1:29:45] that's what other gentiles do
[1:29:50] they find something they can agree with
[1:29:52] they find something that they're
[1:29:53] comfortable with they find the youth
[1:29:54] group that their children fit in they
[1:29:56] find whatever you understand
[1:29:59] paul says do not let your spiritual walk
[1:30:03] be that way
[1:30:06] this i say therefore and testify in the
[1:30:09] lord that ye hints forth walk not as
[1:30:11] other gentiles walk in the vanity of
[1:30:13] their mind
[1:30:16] in the vanity of their
[1:30:18] mind their mind not the mind of christ
[1:30:22] that's the problem
[1:30:25] don't think for a second that you can't
[1:30:28] sit in a message church with the true
[1:30:30] doctrine that you believe in a group of
[1:30:32] a group of brothers and sisters that you
[1:30:34] love and can fellowship with
[1:30:38] don't think you can't set in that type
[1:30:40] of environment and still be walking as
[1:30:41] another gentile
[1:30:44] because if you're doing it of your mind
[1:30:47] you're walking just the same as another
[1:30:49] gentile
[1:30:53] the vanity of their mind
[1:30:57] verse 18 though having the understanding
[1:30:59] darkened
[1:31:01] being
[1:31:02] alienated from the life of god
[1:31:08] through the ignorance that is in them
[1:31:12] because of the blindness of their heart
[1:31:16] this is why the seals had to be loosed
[1:31:20] because if the seals weren't loosed we
[1:31:23] would just be walking as other gentiles
[1:31:25] walked
[1:31:26] but now the seals have been loosed and
[1:31:30] the mind of god has been revealed and
[1:31:33] the life of god has been revealed so now
[1:31:36] we can walk differently from other
[1:31:39] gentiles
[1:31:44] that was the purpose of the seal being
[1:31:47] loosed because of this scripture here
[1:31:49] paul says don't walk that way anymore
[1:31:54] having their understanding darkened our
[1:31:56] understanding is not in darkness we are
[1:31:59] walking in the light
[1:32:01] being alienated from the life of god we
[1:32:04] are not alienated from the life of god
[1:32:07] the words that i speak to you they are
[1:32:09] spirit and they are life
[1:32:12] the ignorance that is in them we do not
[1:32:15] walk in ignorance anymore
[1:32:19] the full word has come christ himself
[1:32:21] has descended
[1:32:23] there is no more excuse for ignorance
[1:32:27] because of the blindness of their heart
[1:32:30] who being past feeling have given
[1:32:31] themselves over into lasciviousness that
[1:32:34] just means lust their own desires their
[1:32:35] own mind
[1:32:38] to work all uncleanness with greediness
[1:32:41] that is the direct result
[1:32:44] of walking as other gentiles
[1:32:46] you will end up in a condition
[1:32:49] of uncleanness
[1:32:51] and greediness and greediness is not
[1:32:54] just meaning you want money
[1:32:57] it may just mean
[1:32:59] that you want a position that's not
[1:33:01] yours
[1:33:01] or you don't want a position that is
[1:33:03] yours
[1:33:05] or you don't want to be a position under
[1:33:07] a position because you want to be the
[1:33:09] main position
[1:33:11] or you don't want to be the potato
[1:33:12] pillar because you want to go and fight
[1:33:15] or maybe you got stabbed three days in a
[1:33:17] row so you're tired of fighting you want
[1:33:18] to go be the potato pillar
[1:33:22] greediness greediness is simple
[1:33:25] simply
[1:33:26] self-desire
[1:33:29] i want
[1:33:30] it can be i want money i want popularity
[1:33:32] i want women i want security i want
[1:33:34] safety i don't want my feelings hurt
[1:33:37] i want a stable job
[1:33:40] it can be any of that
[1:33:41] it can be whatever you want and paul
[1:33:44] says do not walk that way anymore
[1:33:47] walk
[1:33:49] unalienated
[1:33:51] from the life of god
[1:33:54] walk with his word
[1:33:58] walk with the purpose of your life if
[1:34:00] you just play something softly please
[1:34:04] because if you'll do that you won't find
[1:34:06] yourself in a position of uncleanness
[1:34:09] and you will not find yourself in a
[1:34:11] position of greediness
[1:34:13] wanting more of something that's not
[1:34:15] even yours to begin with
[1:34:18] or
[1:34:20] not walking in something that is yours
[1:34:23] because you're fearful of the
[1:34:25] repercussions of that
[1:34:27] but if we will walk
[1:34:30] unlike other gentiles
[1:34:33] that's how we're to walk and we should
[1:34:35] walk that way
[1:34:37] because
[1:34:38] we have not alienated ourselves from the
[1:34:40] life of god which is his word
[1:34:43] that is the form that the life of god
[1:34:46] has came in
[1:34:48] in our day and age
[1:34:50] [Music]
[1:34:52] remember when jonah left the scripture
[1:34:55] says
[1:34:57] jonah got up and left
[1:35:00] the presence of the lord
[1:35:03] and then it says that again he went and
[1:35:05] he got a ship and he went from the
[1:35:07] presence of the lord
[1:35:09] if you'll read the scriptures before
[1:35:11] that
[1:35:12] it says the word of the lord came to
[1:35:14] jonah
[1:35:18] so if the word of the lord came to jonah
[1:35:21] but jonah left the presence of the lord
[1:35:23] what does that make the word of the lord
[1:35:27] [Music]
[1:35:31] brother brahm says we don't look for
[1:35:32] nail scars
[1:35:34] we look for the word made manifest
[1:35:39] don't annihilate yourself
[1:35:43] don't
[1:35:44] that's not the word that i was trying to
[1:35:45] use don't and an alienate yourself
[1:35:50] from the word made manifest
[1:35:54] because it's the only thing that can
[1:35:56] give you life it's the only thing that
[1:35:58] can give you the proper understanding if
[1:36:00] you'll stand with me this evening
[1:36:01] it's the only thing that can make sure
[1:36:05] that you are fulfilling your purpose and
[1:36:07] not somebody else's purpose
[1:36:09] it is the only thing that can keep you
[1:36:11] in the straight and narrow
[1:36:14] it's the only thing
[1:36:17] that can make a difference between you
[1:36:20] and any other church member out there
[1:36:24] is the revealed word of god
[1:36:27] both
[1:36:28] in written form and in your daily life
[1:36:33] you have to have both
[1:36:35] you can have the proper understanding of
[1:36:37] the doctrines but if it is not
[1:36:39] manifested in your life you're still
[1:36:41] just walking as another gentile and paul
[1:36:44] says don't do that
[1:36:45] don't cut yourself off from the life
[1:36:48] don't cut yourself off
[1:36:50] don't be ignorant
[1:36:54] seek him
[1:36:55] seek the will of the lord for your life
[1:36:58] and i said this last service but i just
[1:37:00] want to say it again because it really
[1:37:02] sums up everything that i've taken
[1:37:04] really too long to say
[1:37:08] if the purpose
[1:37:11] of god
[1:37:12] saving each individual
[1:37:15] really is
[1:37:18] equivalent revelation 22 18 the words in
[1:37:21] the book
[1:37:25] and that is the living word we would
[1:37:27] agree with that
[1:37:29] that is the living word
[1:37:33] we have to seek god with the same
[1:37:36] desperation
[1:37:38] for the purpose of our life
[1:37:41] that we do
[1:37:44] for the true interpretation of the
[1:37:45] written word
[1:37:47] [Music]
[1:37:49] with as much
[1:37:50] fervency
[1:37:52] as we sought him for truth of the
[1:37:54] written word
[1:37:56] we have to seek him with that same level
[1:37:58] of fervency
[1:38:00] for the real true revelation
[1:38:02] interpretation of our daily lives
[1:38:04] the living word
[1:38:05] [Music]
[1:38:07] because that is his final reality
[1:38:10] and when i say that
[1:38:11] i'm not saying that this hybrid
[1:38:13] condition is his final reality his final
[1:38:16] reality is himself in flesh
[1:38:20] we know this carcass is going to drop
[1:38:22] away the atoms will change but we're
[1:38:23] still brother brandon says it's the same
[1:38:25] element you're made up of that's going
[1:38:27] to be your glorified body
[1:38:29] [Music]
[1:38:30] there's going to be a dna change hybrid
[1:38:32] and hybridization is going to fall away
[1:38:35] but the same 16 elements are the same 16
[1:38:37] elements that your glorified body is
[1:38:38] going to have
[1:38:40] [Music]
[1:38:42] we have to seek him with that same
[1:38:45] fervency
[1:38:47] for the purpose
[1:38:49] of our individual lives
[1:38:51] as we do for the interpretation of the
[1:38:53] written word
[1:38:55] i would venture to say that there is
[1:38:56] nobody in here that would be comfortable
[1:38:59] going back on any of the doctrines that
[1:39:02] brother branham has preached
[1:39:03] how many wants to go back to eve eaten
[1:39:05] an apple
[1:39:08] we know what happened in the garden
[1:39:10] how many wants to go back to eve eating
[1:39:12] an apple
[1:39:14] and it's suddenly making her realize
[1:39:15] she's naked and the snakes in the tree
[1:39:17] talking to her
[1:39:22] how many wants to go back to not even
[1:39:24] know
[1:39:25] no comprehension of why it has to be a
[1:39:27] blood sacrifice
[1:39:29] these are elementary things
[1:39:31] but there there were people maybe maybe
[1:39:35] not this younger generation because we
[1:39:37] had things handed to us that the other
[1:39:39] generation before us had
[1:39:41] but there was a generation in here that
[1:39:43] that was new to them
[1:39:45] that was new to them
[1:39:47] and they had to seek god desperately is
[1:39:51] this you
[1:39:52] is this truth because it's unlike
[1:39:54] anything that i've ever heard
[1:39:56] and if it's truth i've got to walk in it
[1:39:58] there was a desperation there
[1:40:02] now we know that those doctrines and
[1:40:03] teachings and revelations have continued
[1:40:05] to come and there has been a group of
[1:40:07] people
[1:40:08] that had sought and seeked
[1:40:11] sought god fervently whether this be
[1:40:14] true or not
[1:40:17] we can't now come to the climax of that
[1:40:19] and the purpose of that and say oh yeah
[1:40:22] well my daddy told me it was this so
[1:40:24] it's that
[1:40:26] you know that yeah you know my grandma
[1:40:28] believed that that's what it is
[1:40:30] no fervency brother rhema says that was
[1:40:33] the mistake that first church aide made
[1:40:35] was they failed to keep reaching out in
[1:40:37] the spirit
[1:40:40] we have proper doctrine we have proper
[1:40:41] teaching
[1:40:43] but the perfection is when it comes into
[1:40:46] human beings
[1:40:47] the purpose of our daily lives
[1:40:52] [Music]
[1:40:55] brother branham says when he watched
[1:40:57] that bride going out
[1:40:59] i told you i would get back to this
[1:41:02] when he saw the preview of the bride and
[1:41:04] they were going out
[1:41:06] it says they came the first time just
[1:41:08] perfect
[1:41:08] the worldly church came up running
[1:41:11] running around
[1:41:12] rock and roll music
[1:41:14] he says but then the bride came again
[1:41:16] and just as they was going out of sight
[1:41:19] a couple of them started getting off in
[1:41:20] line
[1:41:22] and he says they were watching that
[1:41:24] worldly church
[1:41:26] that was going off into chaos
[1:41:30] [Music]
[1:41:34] what happened in genesis 1 1
[1:41:37] there was a world being restored
[1:41:40] after chaos
[1:41:42] what happened in the garden of eden
[1:41:44] chaos from leaving the word
[1:41:48] what happens at the end time
[1:41:52] what's the distraction to the true
[1:41:54] church
[1:41:55] is the false church
[1:41:56] leaving the word
[1:41:58] and going into chaos
[1:42:01] they left the purpose of their life
[1:42:05] they left the purpose the words in the
[1:42:08] book
[1:42:09] they left that purpose
[1:42:12] and it led into chaos the pattern will
[1:42:14] never change it will not it never
[1:42:16] changed for eve and never changed for
[1:42:18] the world before that and never changed
[1:42:20] for anybody it's not going to change for
[1:42:22] me and you
[1:42:23] if we don't seek him desperately for the
[1:42:26] truth of our individual lives we're
[1:42:29] going to end up in chaos
[1:42:31] and when one goes into chaos it's going
[1:42:34] to affect the other
[1:42:35] just like brother random says the stars
[1:42:37] does
[1:42:39] let's pray together
[1:42:41] lord jesus we just want to
[1:42:44] thank you for this time of fellowship
[1:42:46] that you've given us lord
[1:42:48] lord i've been lengthy it seems like it
[1:42:50] happens every time lord of just
[1:42:53] way longer than i intended to be
[1:42:57] but father
[1:43:00] i
[1:43:01] know what you were trying to say here
[1:43:02] this evening
[1:43:03] and i've repeated it every way that i
[1:43:06] know how
[1:43:07] without
[1:43:08] just being a complete fool
[1:43:12] lord i know
[1:43:14] what you are trying to get to us
[1:43:19] father and i pray
[1:43:21] for myself
[1:43:22] and for every individual here
[1:43:26] that we can come
[1:43:29] seeking you lord you have sought us
[1:43:33] but now that you have sought us you have
[1:43:36] brought us out of the maori clay
[1:43:39] you were looking for a reciprocal
[1:43:42] seeking
[1:43:43] even so much that you would say in your
[1:43:45] scriptures that when you would seek me
[1:43:46] with all of your heart then you would
[1:43:48] find me
[1:43:50] lord and we're coming down to the very
[1:43:53] closing moments of time
[1:43:56] where every jaw and every tittle
[1:43:59] has to be lined up just so perfectly
[1:44:03] and we have no capability to do that
[1:44:05] within ourselves father
[1:44:08] father you have truly come and restored
[1:44:12] completely your written word
[1:44:15] but i pray that we would seek you
[1:44:18] now with fervency that you would come
[1:44:22] and restore
[1:44:24] every jaw and every tittle of your
[1:44:26] living word
[1:44:28] that we would not be distracted by
[1:44:31] anything going off into chaos but we
[1:44:33] would walk truly and solely in the
[1:44:37] perfect
[1:44:39] revelation of the calling and the
[1:44:42] purpose of our each and every one
[1:44:44] individual lives
[1:44:46] that we would find ourselves with the
[1:44:49] life of god flowing through us
[1:44:53] and that we would not deviate away from
[1:44:55] your word
[1:44:57] and that your word
[1:44:59] your living word
[1:45:01] would fulfill that what you said in
[1:45:03] matthew
[1:45:05] the heavens and earth will pass away
[1:45:08] but my word will not pass away my bride
[1:45:11] will not pass away the purpose
[1:45:13] that i had in saving these individuals
[1:45:17] it will not pass away it will not fail
[1:45:20] it will not go into chaos
[1:45:23] i've predestinated it not to
[1:45:27] father may we yield to that may we
[1:45:30] submit ourselves to that may we
[1:45:32] fervently seek that and not be
[1:45:35] distracted by this world
[1:45:39] i pray that you would bless the people
[1:45:41] here this evening lord
[1:45:43] again i've been way leftier than i
[1:45:45] intended to be and there's there's
[1:45:46] people here that's worked father
[1:45:49] lord i pray that you would just be their
[1:45:52] portion
[1:45:53] that you would restore that to the lord
[1:45:56] that you would give them a good night's
[1:45:57] rest and that you would anoint them for
[1:45:59] their work tomorrow lord give them
[1:46:00] strength give them virtue lord
[1:46:03] we ask this in the name of the lord
[1:46:04] jesus christ
[1:46:06] amen
[1:46:08] god bless you sir

[1:46:39] i know the winds of him
[1:46:44] helped me fly away
[1:46:48] so high
[1:46:57] [Music]
[1:47:03] spread your wings and clouds
[1:47:07] [Music]

[1:47:51] higher every day
[1:47:55] god's only god one way
[1:47:59] you go
[1:48:00] through
[1:48:03] [Music]
[1:48:11] [Music]
[1:48:14] know the winds of faith
[1:48:22] [Music]
[1:48:31] amen
[1:48:33] how many want to find your position
[1:48:36] and man god will lead you just stay true
[1:48:39] to him
[1:48:41] i'd say
[1:48:42] i'd say many times i've talked to people
[1:48:44] who wanted to know what's my position i
[1:48:45] don't know what i'm supposed to do in
[1:48:46] the body
[1:48:47] and it's obvious to me they're already
[1:48:49] doing it
[1:48:51] because it comes natural and it comes so
[1:48:52] natural they don't realize that they're
[1:48:54] already in encourager they're already
[1:48:55] hosting people putting people together
[1:48:58] they're already doing the thing that
[1:48:59] they do best and they're already serving
[1:49:01] the body they don't even realize it
[1:49:04] i mean what it takes more than anything
[1:49:05] is a consecrated desire to be in the
[1:49:07] will of god
[1:49:09] and to give him preeminence
[1:49:11] amen brother brennan made it made a
[1:49:14] statement i was reading in the seals
[1:49:16] that made it so interesting
[1:49:19] you know brother is coming to the
[1:49:20] beginning of the second seal in the
[1:49:21] beginning of the third seal and right
[1:49:23] from the beginning he says
[1:49:25] lord
[1:49:26] he's praying lord reveal this to us it's
[1:49:30] coming to the seals lord reveal this to
[1:49:31] us
[1:49:32] that we'll know how you want us to act
[1:49:34] in this day and that we might be better
[1:49:35] christians
[1:49:37] so what was the revelation and the seal
[1:49:39] supposed to do make us better christians
[1:49:41] amen
[1:49:43] open our eyes so we understand god's
[1:49:45] plan and understand what the antichrist
[1:49:47] spirit is doing and just surrender
[1:49:49] ourselves to god and god can make us
[1:49:51] better at what he called us to do by
[1:49:53] revealing the word to us and one thing i
[1:49:57] wrote down what brother ben was
[1:49:58] preaching
[1:50:01] is we know the second fold purpose of
[1:50:03] god's threefold plan was to have
[1:50:04] preeminence in a body
[1:50:06] but i wrote this little statement
[1:50:08] three minutes must be given before it is
[1:50:11] taken
[1:50:13] god is a gentleman he doesn't come in by
[1:50:15] force and just take
[1:50:16] but you must give him the preeminence
[1:50:18] before he takes the preeminence
[1:50:21] and in this day i think that's the
[1:50:22] greatest call i think that's the heart
[1:50:24] of what brother ben was telling us is
[1:50:26] surrender to god make make your calling
[1:50:29] an election primary in life
[1:50:32] the main focus the main point make it
[1:50:34] important make be sincere about it and
[1:50:37] yield ourselves to god and let god use
[1:50:38] us for whatever he wants to use us for
[1:50:41] we may not always clearly understand
[1:50:43] what we're doing but as long as we're in
[1:50:45] his hand and he's using us and doing it
[1:50:47] through us it's going to work
[1:50:49] and it's going to work
[1:50:50] well i think the main focus my main goal
[1:50:54] for me
[1:50:55] the thing that god's been dealing with
[1:50:56] me on lately is to stay consecrated
[1:51:00] not be distracted but stay consecrated
[1:51:04] so that he can use me man god bless you
[1:51:07] and we sure enjoyed being with you
[1:51:08] tonight
[1:51:09] may god take the word
[1:51:11] may it be manifest what we've heard may
[1:51:14] it come into a manifestation in our
[1:51:16] lives that's my desire this is bow our
[1:51:19] heads and pray lord we thank you
[1:51:21] we want to thank you lord for the word
[1:51:22] that you've given us for the focus and
[1:51:24] attention
[1:51:25] you've drawn our attention lord
[1:51:28] and god i don't believe there's one of
[1:51:29] us who desires to be in the wrong place
[1:51:32] but with all our hearts we desire lord
[1:51:34] to find that place and to operate in
[1:51:36] that place you purposed for us
[1:51:39] for we believe you saved us for a
[1:51:40] purpose
[1:51:42] and god if we can just be true to you
[1:51:44] and surrendered and humble
[1:51:46] we know that you'll do things that we
[1:51:47] never thought of lord
[1:51:49] things we haven't yet imagined things
[1:51:51] that we couldn't comprehend
[1:51:53] so god has a body may we just take this
[1:51:56] time to surrender to you afresh
[1:51:59] may we lord just see ourselves placed in
[1:52:01] your hands and may we not inject our own
[1:52:03] thinking into the program or our own
[1:52:05] ideas our own wishes our own wants
[1:52:09] but god i pray that you would help me
[1:52:10] just to lay myself in your hand and say
[1:52:12] god whatever you want from me is what i
[1:52:14] want you to have what you want me to do
[1:52:17] where you want me to go what you want me
[1:52:18] to say or not say lord i want you to
[1:52:21] have preeminence in me
[1:52:24] god forgive me for my distractions
[1:52:26] forgive me for my own ideas forgive me
[1:52:28] for taking my own mind so many times
[1:52:31] but god after hearing this word more
[1:52:33] than anything lord i just want to do
[1:52:35] your will
[1:52:37] i want to be in your hand i want you to
[1:52:39] be in control
[1:52:40] i want to be surrendered to you
[1:52:43] god as we come to the final moments of
[1:52:46] time
[1:52:47] may you have absolute preeminence in us
[1:52:50] lord
[1:52:51] god we don't want to have our own part
[1:52:54] to play
[1:52:55] nor we just want to surrender everything
[1:52:57] to you
[1:52:58] may you give us a peace and a confidence
[1:53:00] and a rest that we're in your hand
[1:53:03] and we've surrendered to you we've given
[1:53:05] it all to you
[1:53:06] and that you're going to do what you've
[1:53:08] purposed to do from before the
[1:53:09] foundation of the world god you've
[1:53:12] opened the seals to us to show us
[1:53:15] how to be better christians
[1:53:17] now help us to go and manifest that
[1:53:19] better christian life

[1:53:23] families of our workplaces just take

[1:53:32] he gave out
[1:53:33] and god may you use him for your purpose
