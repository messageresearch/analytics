TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and so now he's talking about the great plan that god had one thing he wanted to achieve one goal that he had and everything in the bible has been pointing to this one achievement and so now the lamb's book of life is opened by the lamb he's the only one that's worthy the opening he's the only one that can open it and john when he sees the cry come at the end of time after the church ages he hears a cry says who will come and open the book and nobody's found worthy and john begins to weep because john realizes if nobody's worthy everything in that book is lost and john knew he was in that book and john realizes everything all of creation and everything in that book is lost if nobody can come and take full take take the book amen that's why you and i and we stand here at the end of time amen the seventh angel's already been here he's already come and gone and this book has to be open and the seals have to be revealed at the time of that seventh angel and if that book was not open and christ did not come down with the open book during the life of william branham amen then everything is lost it is our only hope amen but this is why we shouldn't be weeping like john amen because we saw him come forth and take the book and open the seals and we understood it one night after another after another after another when he would come and bring the revelation to those seals what was it the lamb opening the book what was opening the book revealing the seals what was revealing the seals revealing christ amen and because of that we should be like john amen all heaven and all on earth and all under there heard me rejoicing amen saying i worthy and honor and praise be unto him that sitteth on the throne he come and he took the book amen so when he took the book brother bam uses all kinds of terminology he tore off the seals he threw him down to the seventh church take the mister he gave him to the to the to the bride to the church uh he come down with open book in his hand there's all ways to describe this but it's all one in the self same thing amen if you get the open book you get christ if there's no more seals on the book then christ is here in full measure what was keeping christ from the people what was keeping christ from the people was the denominational change that had the holy ghost bound for nearly two thousand years but in the evening time is loose by the evening time message the holy ghost back in the people again what's the holy ghost the life of that word the life that was in christ amen now coming back into the church when's it coming back into the church at the opening of the seals because at the opening of the seals is the fullness of christ unveiled hear presence
