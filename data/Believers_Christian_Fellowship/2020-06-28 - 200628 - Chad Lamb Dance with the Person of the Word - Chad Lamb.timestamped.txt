[4:23] and we didn't have a chance to have a
[4:26] memorial service or anything
[4:28] for sister betty stoner the family did
[4:30] something very private by the graveside
[4:32] and
[4:32] so i just wanted to take a moment as a
[4:34] church just before we move on and
[4:36] just reflect on her life and thank god
[4:38] for the portion that we got to share
[4:40] with her
[4:41] i know there's there's several of you
[4:43] who didn't get the chance to know sister
[4:45] betty
[4:45] but i know there's many who did there's
[4:47] many who went to church with her for
[4:49] years
[4:50] knew her from way back uh sister betty's
[4:53] brother harry's been believers for a
[4:54] long long time and they've journeyed
[4:57] they meant through this life together
[5:00] and through the message together and
[5:01] with many of us
[5:02] and i myself didn't know sister betty
[5:05] really really well
[5:06] until like the last six or seven years
[5:08] and i got to know her better and better
[5:10] and really enjoyed sister betty sister
[5:12] betty was
[5:13] full of life and she told you what she
[5:16] thought
[5:18] and she meant it and i liked it
[5:21] and so i would go visit her from time to
[5:24] time and angie and i would go visit her
[5:26] and she always remembered the last time
[5:28] i visited how long it had been since my
[5:30] previous visit
[5:32] and sometimes it got a little too long
[5:34] and she was always nice but she always
[5:35] reminded me
[5:36] how long it had been we always had a
[5:38] good time with sister betty and
[5:40] brother harry and love them very much
[5:43] and we know it's hard for brother harry
[5:44] to be alone
[5:46] you know sister betty one time she was
[5:48] in the hospital she had
[5:50] gotten sick and she was in the hospital
[5:52] and i went to visit her
[5:54] and i remember i think it was sister
[5:56] marsha hollander told me that back in
[5:58] the tabernacle
[6:00] that she used to play the organ and she
[6:01] could really play the organ
[6:03] and so i told sister betty i said sister
[6:05] betty i heard you used to be a good
[6:07] organ player
[6:08] and sister betty she was laying in the
[6:09] bed she just looked up like this rolled
[6:11] her head up and she goes
[6:13] yeah i was pretty good
[6:20] said praise the lord just be honest you
[6:22] know
[6:23] but i just love that i love that about
[6:26] sister betty
[6:27] i remember when she had to go to the
[6:30] nursing home for a little while
[6:32] and uh while she was in the nursing home
[6:34] angie and i were asking is there any
[6:35] books you'd like do you like to read
[6:37] anything can we bring you anything
[6:38] she was oh i love to read and we said
[6:41] what would you like to read
[6:42] she was spoken word books the only book
[6:44] she wanted was spoken word books
[6:47] and i said praise the lord that's a
[6:48] believer amen
[6:50] that's a believer she wasn't looking to
[6:52] be entertained
[6:53] brother ben said the holy ghost is
[6:55] entertained by the word
[6:56] and so she wanted spoken word books so
[6:58] we appreciate her life
[7:00] the testimony she had her years of
[7:03] faithfulness
[7:04] you know for the last a little over four
[7:07] years she's been bed fast because of a
[7:10] broken hip that didn't heal exactly
[7:12] right and she wasn't able to bear any
[7:13] weight on it
[7:14] and so she would just get up for short
[7:16] stints in a chair
[7:18] and i'd go visit her and year
[7:21] after year for for four years she was
[7:24] always scheming trying to plan a way to
[7:26] get the church
[7:28] she always wanted to get to church she
[7:29] was i just lay here and think
[7:31] and she had lots of time to lay there
[7:32] and think and she thought maybe if they
[7:34] could slide me down on the board maybe
[7:36] if i could get in the chair and maybe
[7:38] she was always trying to figure out some
[7:40] way to get to church
[7:41] before she didn't give up she didn't
[7:43] throw in the towel she kept saying
[7:45] i'm going to get back to church i'm
[7:47] going to get back to church and she was
[7:48] always
[7:49] wanting to find a way to get back to
[7:51] church and i say
[7:52] god bless her sister betty god took her
[7:55] home but
[7:56] she she went home fighting she went home
[7:58] fighting for the word
[7:59] fighting to be in fellowship biting to
[8:01] me she didn't just give up
[8:02] it had been so easy to give up and say
[8:04] well there's just no way but she would
[8:05] lay there for hours trying to think of a
[8:07] way to get back to church
[8:09] i say praise god god let me be that kind
[8:12] of a believer
[8:13] all the way through where i never give
[8:15] up i never roll over
[8:17] i never just give in to my circumstances
[8:19] but i'm always striving
[8:21] to be in fellowship to be in the word to
[8:24] serve god
[8:26] man we want to just say we love brother
[8:29] harry and appreciate
[8:31] the sacrifice the last several years
[8:33] especially for his wife
[8:35] when she was bedfast couldn't do
[8:37] anything for herself
[8:38] harry did it all he was her primary
[8:40] caretaker
[8:41] and we just want to say we love you
[8:43] brother harry and appreciate your life
[8:45] and the sacrifice for your wife it's a
[8:47] real testimony for the rest of us
[8:50] it's a real testimony of love and
[8:52] endurance
[8:53] it's a real testimony of the love of
[8:55] christ and the love of his bride from
[8:56] one another
[8:57] we just want to say it's been a good
[8:59] thing we appreciate sister betty's life
[9:02] we're thankful that she's gone on to the
[9:05] sixth dimension we're thankful she
[9:06] doesn't lay in a bed anymore
[9:08] she's not in the body that's
[9:09] deteriorating year by year
[9:11] she is free from the bondage
[9:14] of skin and bone she's free from the
[9:17] bondage
[9:18] of hybrid flesh and she's now our
[9:21] sister's now running barefoot
[9:23] in that place brother branham went when
[9:25] he went beyond the curtain of time
[9:27] and someday sister betty will greet us
[9:30] all
[9:31] but the sad thing is i only knew her
[9:33] when she was elderly so she may have to
[9:35] introduce herself to me
[9:37] and say don't you know who i am i'm
[9:39] sister betty
[9:40] you knew me as sister betty stoner and i
[9:42] said oh god bless you sister betty
[9:45] amen let's just all stand i just want to
[9:48] pray and thank the lord
[9:50] for sister betty's life thank the lord
[9:52] for the ability to
[9:54] share in that life i also want to
[9:57] mention to you that i got word yesterday

[10:48] brother's going through and you know how
[10:49] to pray
[10:50] and us as an assembly we know how to
[10:51] pray for that assembly because we know
[10:53] what it's like
[10:54] we know the devil can try to bring fear
[10:56] and all the negative news and try to
[10:58] disrupt our faith but how we have to
[11:00] hold on to the word
[11:01] and watch the word pull us through and
[11:03] god did it for us and he can do it for
[11:05] our brothers and sisters there
[11:07] so i want to remember to pray for them
[11:08] as well
[11:10] let's just bow our heads
[11:13] dear lord jesus we thank you god for the
[11:16] privilege lord of knowing our sister
[11:18] betty
[11:19] for we believe that you deposited a
[11:21] portion of yourself and her
[11:23] before the foundation of the world and
[11:26] our love for her was
[11:27] more than just the flesh lord it was
[11:29] that life on the inside
[11:31] and while we know that that life
[11:32] continues on our sister betty is not
[11:34] dead she's alive
[11:36] she's only passed from one dimension to
[11:38] another she's only moved from this
[11:40] journey
[11:41] further in the journey lord that you've
[11:43] ordained for her and now
[11:44] she's at rest and we're thankful for
[11:47] them
[11:48] and god we were left behind lord let the
[11:50] positive effect of her life continue on
[11:53] the ways in which she cheered us up and
[11:55] influenced us and encouraged us
[11:57] let those things continue and god we
[12:00] just want to band together in his
[12:01] assembly and hold up our brother harry
[12:03] before you
[12:04] lord no doubt he's lonely lord he lost a
[12:06] life companion
[12:08] and lord he cared for her so well and i
[12:11] just pray that you would care for him
[12:12] now
[12:13] god that you would provide his every
[12:15] need that you would be a friend that
[12:16] sticks closer than a brother
[12:18] and god that you would anoint us as his
[12:20] family lord to minister and to his needs
[12:22] now
[12:23] god we pray that you would bless us as
[12:25] we all strive to live a life as faithful
[12:28] sister betty's
[12:29] to strive lord to be in fellowship to be
[12:32] in the word
[12:32] lord to have our focal point on you no
[12:35] matter what our condition is
[12:37] let that be our testimony as well and
[12:40] god we want to pray for our brother ron
[12:42] peterson
[12:44] and the whole assembly at evening light
[12:45] fellowship god
[12:47] you brought us through you lifted us up
[12:50] lord when there were so many here that
[12:52] were sick and
[12:53] some that were so seriously ill in the
[12:55] hospital
[12:56] and god we know by experience that by
[12:59] your stripes coven 19 is healed
[13:01] that by your stripes double pneumonia is
[13:03] healed we know it lord
[13:05] we've experienced it we've seen your
[13:06] word work and we know that it will work
[13:08] for our brothers and sisters
[13:10] we pray that your testimony of healing
[13:13] power would continue on in their lives
[13:16] god we pray that you would heal our
[13:17] brother ron and raise him up lord for
[13:19] your glory
[13:20] that you would deliver lord those that
[13:21] are afflicted in the church and
[13:23] and god encouraged their faith lift them
[13:26] up
[13:26] shield them from all the fiery darts of
[13:29] the enemy that would bring
[13:30] doubt or fear and god let your your
[13:33] faith be poured into their heart
[13:34] may they stand fast on the promise and
[13:37] watch the word work
[13:39] while we pray as we move into the
[13:41] reading of your word lord that you would
[13:42] just bless us now
[13:44] that you would just anoint us to receive
[13:46] your word for it
[13:47] by your word we live lord it's your word
[13:49] in us living off the word you're giving
[13:51] to us
[13:52] we pray god that you would just speak
[13:54] clearly to us lord
[13:55] deliver your word into our hearts lord
[13:57] and may we grow from that word and live
[14:00] the life you've called us to live that
[14:02] we can be the manifestation you've
[14:03] called us to be in this hour
[14:05] god bless us now as we look into your
[14:08] word in jesus christ's name we pray
[14:10] amen unless if we could turn to the book
[14:13] of revelation
[14:14] chapter 10 together i'd like to continue
[14:17] on in part four
[14:19] with this thought we had of do not fear
[14:21] his voice
[14:22] i'd also want to say we had a wonderful
[14:24] time
[14:25] brother sam pitzenberger's graduation
[14:28] yesterday
[14:29] as the graduation open house and it was
[14:30] good to see chris sister christie's
[14:32] family who came in
[14:34] and it was really a blessing to see the
[14:36] weather so nice
[14:38] because the forecast for days had been
[14:40] horrible
[14:41] the forecast that morning was horrible
[14:43] and the morning started off
[14:45] horrible and but i know there was many
[14:47] praying they were praying i was praying
[14:49] others were praying
[14:50] and god just moved everything away and
[14:52] they had beautiful weather
[14:53] and that was more than a coincidence
[14:55] friends that was god's love for his
[14:58] children amen
[14:59] so god bless you let's look here at
[15:01] revelations chapter 10.
[15:03] let's start reading at verse 8.
[15:09] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[15:10] spake to me again and said
[15:12] go and take the little book which o
[15:14] which is open in the hand
[15:16] of the angel which standeth upon the sea
[15:18] and upon the earth
[15:19] and i went into the angel unto the angel
[15:21] and said unto him give me the little
[15:23] book
[15:24] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[15:26] up and they shall make thy belly bitter
[15:29] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[15:31] honey
[15:32] i just want to pause for a minute and
[15:35] look at this
[15:36] we read these things so many times that
[15:38] we we just start reciting in our head
[15:40] and moving on but
[15:41] there's so much that can be said in just
[15:43] a phrase
[15:45] and he went to the angel and he says
[15:47] give me the book and
[15:48] he says take it and eat it up so
[15:51] although the angel is the one that has
[15:54] the open book and we must go to the
[15:55] angel to get the open book
[15:57] the way the angel command the
[15:59] commandment is very
[16:00] interesting he doesn't say open your
[16:03] mouth and i'll shove it inside of you
[16:08] so you go and take it and he says take
[16:10] it that's you take action you take it
[16:13] and eat it up those are things that john
[16:16] had to do the angel couldn't do that for
[16:18] john the angel could open the book
[16:20] he could bring it down he could make it
[16:22] available amen he could even send a
[16:25] voice from heaven
[16:26] encouraging john to go and go go and
[16:28] take the book
[16:29] amen but there's something that john has
[16:32] to do
[16:32] and he has to recognize how important
[16:35] the commandment is and he has to say
[16:37] give me the book
[16:38] and then the angel says fine take it
[16:42] come and get it get it jump higher
[16:47] you see what i'm saying i don't think
[16:48] god was playing with him but the point
[16:50] is
[16:50] he had to take it and eat it up not just
[16:54] take it and say i got the book but he
[16:55] had to get the book on the inside of him
[16:58] so there was some action he had to take
[17:00] there was something he had to be
[17:01] deliberate about
[17:03] praise be to god and it shall make thy
[17:06] belly bitter but it shall be in thy
[17:07] mouth sweet as honey
[17:10] and i took the little book out of the
[17:11] angel's hand and ate it up
[17:13] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[17:15] and as soon as i had eaten it
[17:17] my belly was bitter and he said to me
[17:20] thou
[17:20] must prophesy again before many peoples
[17:23] nations
[17:24] tongues and kings god bless the reading
[17:27] of his word as you have your seats
[17:32] this is a super familiar passage of
[17:35] scripture and it ties in
[17:36] to what we've been talking about the
[17:37] last several weeks and we're going to
[17:38] continue
[17:39] speaking on these things lord willing
[17:42] and
[17:44] and brother bam says in things that are
[17:46] to be
[17:47] we've read this quote a few times now so
[17:49] it's becoming very familiar
[17:51] that if we are those attributes of god
[17:53] we cannot live by creeds
[17:55] we cannot live by denominationalism we
[17:57] must live by the word because the bride
[17:59] is part of the bridegroom like any wife
[18:01] is part of her husband
[18:03] therefore we must be that word bride now
[18:06] every statement brother venom makes
[18:08] it's just the word coming forth and it's
[18:10] so rich and it's so
[18:11] full and it means so much that sometimes
[18:14] you can hardly get through a sentence
[18:16] without it just blossoming and opening
[18:18] but he says
[18:19] we cannot live by creeds we cannot live
[18:22] by denominationalism
[18:25] and and we have to understand that it's
[18:27] got to be the word
[18:29] amen not the denominationalism and
[18:31] denominationalism is a spirit
[18:33] not the title over a door so sometimes
[18:37] we
[18:37] think we can we can be mistaken in the
[18:40] fact that we go to a message church that
[18:42] i'll never be caught in
[18:43] denominationalism
[18:44] but you can have the spirit of
[18:46] denominationalism wherever you are
[18:49] right and then you can accept creed amen
[18:52] wherever you sit
[18:54] you can accept creed and you can you can
[18:56] live by denominationalism
[18:58] amen sitting in any church amen you
[19:00] could do it sitting in brother branham's
[19:02] church while brother branham's preaching
[19:05] and it wouldn't be his fault
[19:08] because the denominational spirit
[19:10] wouldn't be caused by him
[19:12] it wouldn't be his fault and so we we
[19:14] realized the bride cannot live by creed
[19:17] she cannot live by denominationalism but
[19:19] she must live by the word
[19:21] amen and the word is a person
[19:26] right it's more than just ink on paper
[19:29] the word
[19:29] is a person i was telling somebody last
[19:33] night
[19:34] and and i don't really want to get into
[19:36] this now but
[19:37] god says says it so i'm going to say it
[19:40] i thought i'd get into it next week but
[19:41] lord have mercy
[19:43] if you watch if you watch the jews
[19:45] there's a certain
[19:47] ritual that the jews have amen every
[19:49] year where they take the tour out and
[19:51] they dance with the torah
[19:53] and and it's very symbolic and it has a
[19:55] lot of rich and deep meaning
[19:57] but you can see how they have so much
[20:00] love and respect for the word of god
[20:02] amen that they're they take the the
[20:04] scrolls that are rolled together
[20:06] and they encase it in a in a certain
[20:08] encasing and and they they they wrap
[20:10] their arms around it and they dance and
[20:11] they all sing and
[20:12] dance amen to the dance of the torah and
[20:15] the symbology is rich and the symbology
[20:17] is good it has wonderful symbology but
[20:20] the thing that struck my heart when you
[20:21] watch them dancing
[20:23] is they love the torah they love they
[20:26] love the scrolls
[20:27] they love the word of god but they don't
[20:29] love
[20:30] jesus christ
[20:35] and so you know they were loving the
[20:37] torah they
[20:38] they they have such respect for the
[20:41] scrolls and for the word of god
[20:43] that when the jewish scribes would even
[20:45] scribe out a line
[20:46] amen they would wash themselves change
[20:48] them clothes go and they would write
[20:50] i mean it wasn't a trivial thing it was
[20:52] a very serious thing and it needed that
[20:54] level of seriousness and that level of
[20:55] consecration
[20:57] and the word was kept in a special place
[20:59] and the scrolls were laid up
[21:00] and they were protected and they were
[21:02] transported from place to place by being
[21:04] carried
[21:04] and all of this carries rich symbolism
[21:07] amen
[21:08] but the the point is when jesus christ
[21:10] showed up that was
[21:11] everything in those scrolls in a man
[21:14] they wanted to throw a rock at that man
[21:17] while dancing with the scroll
[21:23] i hope you understand what i'm saying
[21:27] we love our bibles we love the message
[21:31] but don't dance with the message app
[21:35] amen dance with the person of the word
[21:42] see what i'm saying and i love the
[21:44] message app and i love my message books
[21:46] but don't dance with the book
[21:52] dance with the person of the word the
[21:56] message
[21:56] is not 1200 sermons
[21:59] the message is jesus christ
[22:04] so we can have the wrong focus we can
[22:07] slip into denominationalism
[22:09] and we can say i just love the message
[22:12] i just love playing that tape i just
[22:15] love hearing that voice
[22:17] it's so soothing to me and all of those
[22:19] things are true
[22:20] and all of that is right but if you
[22:22] reject
[22:23] what he's saying if you reject the
[22:27] revelation of the truth that he's
[22:28] bringing
[22:29] what good is it to love your message app
[22:32] and reject the person of the word that
[22:35] is here
[22:35] manifesting himself everything that that
[22:38] prophet preached is here now
[22:40] manifesting through the bride and if you
[22:42] reject that
[22:43] we've become we've come to the same
[22:45] place they were in jesus day
[22:47] dancing with the scroll covering the
[22:49] scroll protecting the word
[22:51] honoring the word loving the word loving
[22:54] the temple
[22:55] and rejecting the person amen who wrote
[22:58] the book
[23:01] moses moses comes along and and he's
[23:05] given instructions
[23:06] to build a tabernacle that matches the
[23:08] tabernacle reflection of the one that's
[23:10] in heaven
[23:11] and he gets those instructions and those
[23:13] instructions come from god
[23:14] and god wants to build a reflection on
[23:16] the earth and it's gonna
[23:18] it's gonna be a way for the children of
[23:19] israel to know god better because he's
[23:21] going to display himself
[23:23] through these three stages moving to the
[23:26] inner court
[23:27] he wants a place where he can dwell with
[23:28] his people so they're setting all of
[23:30] this
[23:30] up and they build the tabernacle they
[23:33] get everything just right
[23:35] they donate the gold amen they they beat
[23:38] it out
[23:38] they make all the they make all the
[23:40] altars they make everything that they're
[23:42] supposed to make
[23:43] embroidered cloth they build it all and
[23:45] when they get it all right according to
[23:47] the word for their day
[23:48] the presence of god comes down and
[23:51] dwells
[23:52] in that tabernacle because that
[23:54] tabernacle
[23:55] is the manifestation of the word for
[23:57] their day
[23:58] amen and god lives in the manifestation
[24:01] of the word for that day
[24:04] that makes sense but when they begin to
[24:08] reject the word he would send more
[24:10] prophecy bring correction they begin
[24:12] to move away and they took what moses
[24:14] wrote and made it a tradition
[24:16] and when they made it a tradition they
[24:18] begin to add men's understanding to the
[24:20] word
[24:21] and really when it really comes down to
[24:24] it
[24:25] they were really they were really taking
[24:29] that word
[24:30] and trying to make that word fit their
[24:32] desire
[24:34] that's really exactly what happened
[24:37] because one person wanted to be bigger
[24:38] than the other person
[24:40] so he would make the word match him so
[24:41] that he can have his own sect and become
[24:43] a king and he's the one with the right
[24:45] interpretation and
[24:46] these other ones they want to they want
[24:48] to live a a compromised life so they
[24:50] take some of the word and
[24:51] interpret it a certain way so they can
[24:53] start living a little bit of a
[24:54] compromised life
[24:55] and so they take the word that god gave
[24:58] amen to moses
[24:59] moses took that word and wrote it in a
[25:01] book amen and now they began to take
[25:04] the words that were in that book and
[25:06] through their own interpretation they
[25:07] began to divide themselves
[25:09] they meant so that they really could
[25:11] fulfill the lust of their own flesh
[25:15] through pride or through selfishness or
[25:17] through self-indulgence
[25:19] or however they began to take the word
[25:22] and they were missing the person of the
[25:24] word
[25:24] and started taking the writing on the
[25:27] paper on the parchment
[25:28] and making and taking that writing on
[25:30] the parchment and they may have the
[25:32] phrase
[25:33] exactly correct and not change the
[25:36] phrase
[25:36] but when they take the phrase and apply
[25:38] it with a selfish heart
[25:40] or with pride they change the intent and
[25:43] meaning of the word
[25:46] amen is that right
[25:50] and they would still dance with the book
[25:54] and the pharisees would dance with the
[25:56] book
[25:58] not liking the sadducees and the
[25:59] sadducees would dance with the book
[26:04] the herodians would dance with the book
[26:06] the essenes would dance with the book
[26:08] they were all dancing with the book but
[26:11] who was
[26:12] dancing with the person of the book
[26:19] oh praise god
[26:24] nothing's changed if if we can gather
[26:28] any lesson nothing's changed
[26:30] every spirit was alive then is alive now
[26:33] nothing's changed and i love the message
[26:37] i love the books
[26:39] i love the tapes i love my message app i
[26:41] love it all
[26:43] but i want to dance with him i want to
[26:46] embrace the person of the word
[26:48] the life that's coming through all of
[26:50] that the life that gave that revelation
[26:53] the life
[26:53] the life that was in that prophet
[26:56] i don't want to just embrace the prophet
[27:00] but i want to embrace the life that was
[27:02] in that prophet
[27:04] i want to dance with the word but not
[27:07] holding a paper book
[27:08] because the paper book will go nowhere
[27:11] when the destruction falls upon this
[27:13] earth
[27:13] the paper books will be burnt
[27:17] amen the message app someday will come
[27:20] to nothing
[27:23] the printing presses will melt
[27:26] everything will come to not
[27:28] but the word will continue on and if i'm
[27:31] embracing the wrong thing amen
[27:34] i could find myself lacking in that day
[27:37] missing something because
[27:38] i was embracing amen i was embracing the
[27:41] mechanism by which the word came without
[27:44] embracing the word
[27:47] praise god we can do this with our local
[27:50] church we can do this with a minister we
[27:52] can do this with brother branham
[27:53] we can do it with the books and the
[27:55] tapes we can start embracing the
[27:57] mechanism by which the word is
[27:59] portrayed or displayed and not embraced
[28:02] the word himself
[28:04] and we get caught dancing
[28:07] dancing with a minister
[28:13] dancing with the church i go to so and
[28:16] so church it's such a wonderful church
[28:19] i think you should like your church i
[28:21] mean i don't think you should think
[28:23] you're in the worst church
[28:26] you know i think you should i think i
[28:28] think when god places you there it
[28:29] should be a fit and you should say i
[28:31] love my church you should say that
[28:33] but don't don't be dancing with the
[28:35] church dance with christ
[28:38] amen don't everybody should love their
[28:42] pastor
[28:44] and they should think he's the best
[28:46] pastor in the whole world
[28:48] [Laughter]
[28:51] but don't dance with the man look beyond
[28:55] the veil
[28:55] dance with the word don't be
[28:59] don't be taking the book and holding it
[29:01] up in front of your friends and say
[29:02] oh i love the pastor oh i love the
[29:05] preacher
[29:06] oh i love it so wonderful it's so
[29:08] wonderful amen
[29:09] that's just the paper the word was
[29:12] written on that's just the mechanism
[29:13] that he's using to bring the word
[29:15] go past the paper and go to the person
[29:18] that gives the word and dance with him
[29:24] praise be to god amen
[29:28] they come to the temple they you know
[29:30] they had the tabernacle in the windows
[29:31] they had the temple
[29:32] amen that solomon built and everything
[29:35] was set in order
[29:36] and the presence of god came down amen
[29:39] so that they couldn't even
[29:40] minister anymore the presence of god was
[29:42] so thick and everybody that would look
[29:43] to this temple would be delivered
[29:45] because solomon's temple
[29:46] amen became the manifestation of the
[29:49] word in that day
[29:51] but there come a time when they turned
[29:54] temple worship
[29:55] into denominationalism and creed
[29:58] the very thing that god gave them the
[30:01] very thing that
[30:02] the very place where he dwelt the very
[30:05] place of his presence became a creed in
[30:08] the denomination
[30:09] and when it became a creed in the
[30:11] denomination the shekinah glory of god
[30:13] lifted and moved away from that
[30:15] tabernacle amen
[30:17] and god god so wanted them to recognize
[30:20] that his presence was not always
[30:22] attached
[30:23] to a previous dispensation
[30:28] right because knowing where god was
[30:30] doesn't do us a lot of good
[30:32] we need to know where god is so knowing
[30:35] where god was
[30:36] amen god when they begin to turn from
[30:39] the life when they begin to turn
[30:41] from the person amen and they they began
[30:44] to turn from the person where did they
[30:46] turn to they turned to the temple
[30:50] and it looked so good because it
[30:54] looked like we're being real believers
[30:57] because we're coming to the temple
[30:59] doing what he told us to do offering a
[31:01] lamb offering a turtle dove offering of
[31:03] this
[31:04] but but but god says you do it without
[31:07] sincerity
[31:09] your heart's far from me you serve me
[31:11] amen in form and in fashion
[31:13] amen but your heart is far from me amen
[31:16] now you're walking past
[31:18] the golden pillars amen and you're
[31:20] looking at the beautiful
[31:21] artifacts around the temple and you're
[31:23] rubbing amen the beautiful masonry on
[31:25] the wall
[31:25] and you're loving the temple but you're
[31:28] not loving the life that's dwelling in
[31:30] the temple because if you love the life
[31:33] that dwells in the temple when that life
[31:34] moves somewhere else you move with it
[31:36] amen because you love the life you don't
[31:38] love the temple
[31:40] it's not the stone work we're in love
[31:42] with amen it's not the embroidery on the
[31:44] curtains it's not the altar of incense
[31:46] amen all of that was meant to point us
[31:49] to who was behind the veil
[31:50] amen we were supposed to love the one
[31:52] that was behind the veil
[31:54] but they started loving the veil so much
[31:57] so that when god rent the veil inherits
[31:59] temple from top to bottom
[32:01] they were so in love with the temple and
[32:02] so in love with the veil
[32:04] rather than recognizing that the mercy
[32:06] seat was empty they stitched the veil
[32:08] back together
[32:11] and kept loving the veil
[32:16] dancing with the book loving the veil
[32:18] having all the ceremonies of worship
[32:20] and it looked so good but it moved from
[32:23] a live worship to a dead worship when
[32:25] the sukkah glory of god moved on
[32:29] and now it was dead
[32:32] because there was no life in that temple
[32:35] the whole purpose of that temple
[32:37] was to give a revelation of god and god
[32:39] was dwelling there with his people
[32:42] when they changed the purpose of the
[32:44] temple remember god didn't change the
[32:45] purpose of them but they changed the
[32:47] purpose of that temple
[32:49] and they made it a way where they could
[32:51] live selfishly
[32:52] and live to pride and still come to the
[32:54] temple
[32:55] and pretend everything was all right
[33:02] i tell you as
[33:06] as god lifts us up in revelation as we
[33:09] get nearer to the final end of all of
[33:10] this
[33:12] i promise you there will be no place to
[33:15] hide
[33:17] no hiding behind religion no hiding
[33:19] behind mom and dad
[33:21] no going to church and raising your
[33:22] hands and singing and feel like
[33:23] everything's all right
[33:24] the only way that everything's going to
[33:26] be all right is that the same pillar of
[33:28] fire that lived in that temple
[33:29] lives in this temple and nothing else
[33:31] will do
[33:33] not another no form no ritual no
[33:35] listening to three tapes a day and
[33:37] reading all 1200 messages and reciting
[33:39] it verbatim
[33:40] that won't do any good amen wherever
[33:42] that life
[33:43] is there is life when the life leaves it
[33:45] becomes death and the only thing that's
[33:47] going to be
[33:48] all right is when the life that was
[33:50] behind that veil is behind this
[33:52] veil and then you're not
[33:55] dancing with the paper you're dancing
[33:58] with the word
[34:01] you're not dancing you know with your
[34:03] phone i just love the message
[34:09] you're dancing with the word because the
[34:11] word's in you
[34:14] god so made his message clear
[34:19] that he allowed not one stone to be upon
[34:22] another stone
[34:24] in that temple amen
[34:27] the tabernacle was lost solomon's temple
[34:31] destroyed herod's temple destroyed
[34:34] why god is trying to show i'm not there
[34:39] i'm not there i'm not there
[34:47] god bless us and help us
[34:55] reciting bible verses it's wonderful
[34:59] memorizing the word it's important
[35:03] but we can do that and not miss and miss
[35:06] the person of the world
[35:10] the message came the forerunner came
[35:14] to show us where the shekinah glory of
[35:16] god was
[35:18] and it was manifesting through a little
[35:20] man
[35:21] with a seventh grade education son of
[35:24] man ministry
[35:25] a son of man revealing the son of man
[35:28] what was that
[35:29] the son of man jesus christ
[35:32] himself god amen manifesting
[35:37] in present tense amen and showing us
[35:39] where the shekinah glory of god was and
[35:44] that came
[35:45] so that the body would unite with the
[35:48] head
[35:49] so that there would be an invisible
[35:51] marriage union amen so that
[35:53] now that life that was in that prophet
[35:55] now comes into you
[36:01] and see because
[36:05] they begin to love the temple
[36:09] more than they loved the person
[36:13] the temple became an idol
[36:19] and god had to destroy their idol
[36:22] because they were loving the building
[36:25] and not the person
[36:29] we understand whatever
[36:33] whatever causes whatever takes our
[36:36] affection
[36:37] away from the present tense word
[36:41] is our idol
[36:47] because the present tense word is where
[36:50] the glory of god is is where the
[36:52] presence of god is
[36:53] is the proper place of worship is where
[36:55] god is working
[36:56] and where god should be worshipped
[37:00] and anything that takes us from that has
[37:04] become an idol
[37:09] and so we don't want to be idolaters
[37:12] we want to be believers
[37:16] so let's make sure that we dance with
[37:20] christ
[37:22] praise god let's get back to this quote
[37:25] and things that are to be
[37:28] it's like any wife is part of her
[37:30] husband therefore we must be
[37:33] that word bride
[37:36] see you can't say
[37:40] that you love this
[37:45] and don't love the word bride
[37:51] and you can't say you love this
[37:55] and not love the present-day
[37:56] manifestation
[37:58] of christ in a veil
[38:01] which is the word bride you can't tell
[38:04] me that you love malachi 4
[38:09] and reject revelations 10 8-11
[38:14] something doesn't compute you can't tell
[38:17] me you love the
[38:18] word and and reject the bride age and
[38:20] the christ and the formation of the
[38:22] bride
[38:23] and christ in bride form you can't
[38:25] reject that and love this
[38:30] because what you're doing now is you're
[38:32] dancing with a book
[38:38] but this book won't rapture you
[38:45] the paper you tear it out and eat it
[38:48] will
[38:48] it won't change your body amen
[38:53] but the life that wrote this word and
[38:56] the life that comes and reveals it
[38:58] will change you from glory to glory
[39:03] and so we say we love the messenger
[39:07] but declaring that we hate his message
[39:11] because his message his message was the
[39:14] coming of the lord
[39:15] his message was the bright coming of
[39:17] christ that was his message
[39:21] so how can we say we love the messenger
[39:23] and hate his message
[39:28] see we
[39:31] without even realizing it
[39:34] we love whatever it is about that
[39:38] previous dispensation
[39:40] that makes me feel fine the way i am
[39:43] without changing
[39:44] is really what we love
[39:48] to say i love my bible
[39:52] but i don't love the present tense
[39:54] manifestation of jesus christ
[39:56] because the present tense requires a
[39:58] change in me
[39:59] because if i'm going to be the very life
[40:01] of jesus christ
[40:03] then some things in my life have got to
[40:05] change
[40:07] some things have got to fall off because
[40:08] if jesus christ was living in his flesh
[40:10] he wouldn't be doing this
[40:13] and it requires a greater consecration a
[40:15] greater sacrifice a greater death to
[40:17] self a greater surrender to a spirit
[40:19] the real manifestation of this word
[40:21] requires a total
[40:22] selfless abandonment and an absolute
[40:25] preeminence from him
[40:29] and we say we reject that
[40:32] but love this and dance with the word
[40:35] and love the message but really this is
[40:38] just me brother chad i could be a
[40:40] million miles from right this is just
[40:41] where i feel
[40:43] really what we want is we want to be
[40:46] able to identify
[40:48] malachi 4
[40:51] and and show all the miracles in malachi
[40:55] 4
[40:57] and the manifestation of jesus christ
[40:59] and the perfection of the word
[41:02] and begin to love that ministry
[41:06] which was the ministry of christ it was
[41:07] true nothing wrong with that
[41:11] but love that ministry but reject the
[41:14] present tense ministry
[41:16] then you have to ask yourself why would
[41:18] you reject the present tense if you love
[41:20] that so much because this is a
[41:21] continuation of that
[41:25] like this is the same thing that was
[41:27] right
[41:29] he just pulled it out of that tabernacle
[41:31] and put it in this tabernacle
[41:32] but what's the difference there is no
[41:34] difference it's the same person it's the
[41:37] same lord jesus christ
[41:38] it's the same person of the word he's
[41:40] moved from that tabernacle
[41:42] of the seventh angel and he's moved into
[41:45] the formation of his bride
[41:47] amen and now to reject that when you say
[41:50] oh i don't reject the people when you
[41:52] reject that whole truth
[41:55] when you reject it that's true when you
[41:57] reject that christ is in bright form
[41:59] when you reject that you move to the
[42:00] bride and would you reject all of that
[42:02] my question is why what is it i mean
[42:05] what kind of
[42:06] why what is it that we're attaching to
[42:08] the past so much that will reject the
[42:10] present day
[42:11] amen unless amen holding on to the past
[42:14] is somehow a covering for my failure in
[42:17] present day
[42:20] because that's what it always was for
[42:21] the jews that's what it always was
[42:24] they turned the past dispensation into
[42:26] an idol
[42:27] amen when moses took that serpent and
[42:29] put it on a rod
[42:31] the brazen serpent it was the present
[42:33] day truth
[42:34] it was the word made manifest on that
[42:37] pole
[42:37] and he told moses amen everybody who's
[42:40] bit by the fire servant when they look
[42:42] on that they shall live
[42:43] and they looked and they lived but
[42:45] generations later there comes another
[42:47] prophet
[42:48] who's got to take that same thing that
[42:50] was god in their day
[42:52] that would bring total deliverance now
[42:54] it was bringing them to bondage because
[42:55] now they were worshiping the serpent on
[42:57] the pole
[42:59] and they were not worshiping the god
[43:01] that was behind the veil they were
[43:02] worshiping the serpent on the pole
[43:04] they had turned it into an idol and now
[43:06] a prophet had to come and smash that
[43:08] thing and grind it to powder
[43:12] why why is there uh why is there
[43:16] uh such a pull in mankind and the devil
[43:19] working on the nature of man
[43:20] to always go back to the last place god
[43:23] was
[43:24] amen and begin to to rub the monuments
[43:27] and kiss the feet and go back to holy
[43:30] places
[43:35] why if if
[43:38] everything that was in that vessel
[43:41] is here today
[43:45] and i loved that
[43:49] why wouldn't i spend all my time and
[43:51] energy in this
[43:56] see what i'm saying like no rejection of
[43:59] the past manifestation
[44:00] like for now if we would find noah's ark
[44:03] and really uncover it and find it
[44:06] and you could go tour it give me a
[44:08] ticket
[44:10] give me a ticket because that's what god
[44:13] did this is the very ark this is what he
[44:15] built
[44:15] according to the word of the lord i want
[44:16] to see how he pinned it i want to see
[44:18] how he pitched it i want to see what the
[44:19] rooms were like
[44:20] i want to see sign me up give me a
[44:22] ticket i'll go visit it
[44:23] and when i visit it i'll have tingling
[44:25] sensations being in it
[44:28] right but that ark won't save me today
[44:34] so there's no disrespect for the ark
[44:37] there's no lack of love and affection
[44:39] for it
[44:39] amen sign me up i would be there i'd be
[44:42] in line
[44:43] i want to look at it i want to crawl all
[44:45] over it i want to i want
[44:46] i want to know right
[44:50] that's why there's tours going back to
[44:51] the holy land all the time amen i would
[44:53] like to go sometime myself
[44:55] see and feel the atmosphere the
[44:58] environment and look at the places and
[44:59] see the
[45:00] actual distances and what it looks like
[45:02] from this mountaintop i would love to go
[45:04] do that
[45:04] and i would go out of respect for what
[45:07] happened there that day
[45:08] amen but what happened in that day was
[45:10] the word for that day
[45:12] and going back and laying in the tomb
[45:15] where jesus was supposedly laid will not
[45:17] change me one drop and going down and
[45:20] touching the place where his blood
[45:21] spilled on the ground
[45:23] won't change me one speck amen the only
[45:26] thing that will change me
[45:27] is finding whatever life went out there
[45:29] at calvary when i can find that life and
[45:31] unite
[45:32] with that life that'll change me
[45:34] [Applause]
[45:37] so idols are so much different than what
[45:39] it's not a little statue you put in your
[45:41] house in light a little incense
[45:42] and you say i'm not an idol worshiper
[45:45] i don't even have a statue
[45:52] do you understand what i'm saying but we
[45:55] take the things of god
[45:57] and turn them into idols and hold on to
[45:59] past
[46:02] because it frees us from the
[46:05] responsibility of the presence
[46:15] because the challenge of the hour has
[46:18] always been the word of the hour
[46:23] the challenge of the hour listen i'll
[46:26] tell you friends people keep
[46:27] sending me clips and i get this and that
[46:30] i get clips
[46:31] all the time of charismatic and
[46:33] pentecostal people talking about how
[46:34] wonderful brother branham was and he was
[46:36] a prophet
[46:40] they're looking back and saying god was
[46:42] working in that man he was a true
[46:43] prophet of god
[46:46] i get clips women preachers charismatic
[46:51] movement people they can identify that
[46:54] there was a prophet there and that god
[46:56] was working in that man
[47:00] but they have no idea where god is now
[47:06] so being able to recognize what happened
[47:10] that's wonderful we appreciate that but
[47:12] my salvation comes in recognizing what's
[47:14] happening
[47:16] where god is today
[47:22] and that's what i want to give my whole
[47:25] life to
[47:26] and i don't want any religion
[47:31] i don't want any religion to become my
[47:33] covering
[47:36] because my covering is the revealed word
[47:38] for this hour
[47:40] my clothing my covering is the revealed
[47:43] word for this hour
[47:46] and i want to be covered in him
[47:50] clothed in his righteousness which is
[47:52] his word today
[47:54] and living his life with the life of the
[47:57] word living on the inside
[48:01] and i don't want to make anything an
[48:03] idol my church
[48:04] my favorite preacher i don't want to
[48:06] make brother branham i don't want to
[48:08] make
[48:08] anything an idol i want to worship the
[48:11] true and living god
[48:13] and the true and living god is alive and
[48:15] well and on earth today
[48:17] but he's hidden behind a veil of skin
[48:23] and i want to get in behind the skin
[48:25] with him
[48:26] and i want him behind my skin
[48:30] so so we find now that that
[48:34] we have got we have got to stay tuned in
[48:41] to where christ is
[48:44] in the wilderness journey they had to
[48:46] move when christ moved
[48:49] they had to follow that pillar of fire
[48:51] because life and leadership was coming
[48:53] from the pillar of fire
[48:54] it wasn't coming from the the last
[48:56] dispensation or the last move or the
[48:58] last camp
[49:00] right i mean they
[49:04] if you think about they set the
[49:06] tabernacle up on dirt
[49:08] it was set up on dirt and they set the
[49:12] holy of holies and the holy of holies
[49:14] was over top dirt
[49:16] desert sand dirt whatever was there they
[49:18] may have cleared it and leveled it i
[49:19] don't know what all they did but then
[49:21] on that they would have set the the ark
[49:24] of the covenant
[49:25] and on that ark of the covenant the
[49:26] presence of god would come
[49:28] so the presence of god was on this spot
[49:32] on the planet earth
[49:35] you got that right
[49:39] and when that pillar of fire left the
[49:41] shekinah glory of god the presence
[49:42] president's lord and moved on
[49:44] they had to pack everything up and turn
[49:46] their back on that spot and move on
[49:49] and not build a temple in that spot and
[49:51] remember where he was
[49:55] you see what i'm saying they could
[49:59] go and touch it and pick up some sand
[50:01] and put in little cruise and carry with
[50:02] them everywhere they went
[50:03] but if they didn't keep following that
[50:05] light that sand wasn't doing them any
[50:06] good
[50:10] so the word is more than writing the
[50:12] word is more than preaching
[50:14] amen the word is a person and the person
[50:17] is alive today
[50:18] and he's preaching his word today
[50:23] that's what i said don't fear his voice
[50:28] don't fear his voice where is his voice
[50:31] the prophet told us where his voice is
[50:33] his voice is in his bride
[50:37] there was a time that isaiah's prophecy
[50:41] was prophecy
[50:43] and it was laying in a book a virgin
[50:46] shall conceive
[50:48] laying in a book and you could love that
[50:51] word and read that word and say oh
[50:55] a virgin is going to conceive
[50:58] god is going to come i just love that
[51:01] prophecy
[51:03] i love thinking about it i love looking
[51:05] forward to it i love dwelling on it and
[51:07] meditating on it
[51:08] and looking at it and teaching i love it
[51:10] but there come a time that that word
[51:12] came to life
[51:13] inside a little virgin girl in nazareth
[51:18] right and she had a visitation of an
[51:21] angel who come and told her you're the
[51:23] one of
[51:24] that word and that prophecy now was
[51:27] inside of her
[51:31] and they were mocking her and laughing
[51:33] at her and disbelieving her story
[51:36] and the same time going home and opening
[51:38] up isaiah and reading and saying i just
[51:39] love this prophecy
[51:41] someday the virgin's going to conceive
[51:44] oh
[51:44] praise be to god and they had different
[51:46] interpretations someday the virgin
[51:48] nation is going to conceive no one
[51:50] individual virgin's going to conceive
[51:52] the virgin daughter of the high priest
[51:54] and blah blah blah
[51:55] oh i can't wait for that day and then
[51:57] daddy daddy did you hear
[51:59] that mary next door who's supposed to be
[52:01] getting married joseph did you hear
[52:02] she's pregnant and she's got some funny
[52:04] story that an angel told her and that
[52:06] this is going to be the messiah
[52:11] that's not true
[52:19] what are you doing for devotionals
[52:20] tonight dad i'm reading out of isaiah
[52:23] a virgin shall conceive
[52:27] do you see my point friends
[52:30] it's so easy to miss where the life is
[52:34] because it's behind the veil and it's so
[52:37] easy to see where it was
[52:41] it's so easy that other people even
[52:44] non-elect can see where it was
[52:49] but it's so difficult for the world to
[52:52] see where it
[52:52] is because that's given by revelation
[52:59] there was a time that god himself gave
[53:01] abraham a promise
[53:03] you shall bring forth a son and that was
[53:05] a beautiful promise
[53:06] and sarah and and abraham
[53:09] they wanted that word they wanted that
[53:11] promise so sarah injected herself into
[53:14] the mix in her mind to find a way to
[53:15] bring about the promise
[53:17] and this this whole thing with hagar
[53:19] happen in ishmael
[53:20] and all that but there come a time when
[53:23] god's promise
[53:25] came to life and manifestation inside
[53:28] sarah
[53:33] and that couldn't be rejected because
[53:35] that was gone
[53:37] to reject that was to reject god
[53:41] to reject a pregnant virgin girl from
[53:44] nazareth was to reject god
[53:50] and dancing with the scroll
[53:56] you see how dangerous denominationalism
[53:58] is
[54:00] how deadly it is that's why my brother
[54:03] said above everything pray for
[54:05] revelation
[54:07] pray for revelation
[54:13] denominationalism
[54:16] and creed come from cain
[54:20] amen because
[54:24] abel was willing to wait
[54:28] until he knew how god wanted to be
[54:30] worshipped
[54:33] but cain just wanted to worship god
[54:36] the way he wanted to worship god
[54:40] according to his desire and it wasn't
[54:43] that he wasn't going to make a sacrifice
[54:45] it wasn't that he wasn't going to put an
[54:46] effort
[54:47] he was going to put in a great deal of
[54:48] effort make a huge sacrifice
[54:50] work hard amen and really really offer
[54:53] worship
[54:54] and cain offered worship cain
[54:57] worked diligently to bring forth his
[54:59] sacrifice and bring forth
[55:01] his offering to god but
[55:04] that's not what god wanted it's what
[55:07] cain wanted and i wonder how much of our
[55:11] worship
[55:12] is worship that we like preaching we
[55:20] like
[55:21] music we like a schedule we like
[55:27] like i wonder how much of our i wonder
[55:29] how much of our worship
[55:33] is worship that we like
[55:38] abel didn't give the worship able light
[55:44] abel gave the worship god wanted
[55:50] so denominationalism
[55:54] is not going to the baptist church
[55:58] or the pentecostal denominational
[56:03] is finding a way to worship that
[56:05] satisfies me
[56:11] do you understand what i'm saying amen
[56:13] finding a way to worship that satisfies
[56:16] me that i like
[56:19] this is it like like i can't stand when
[56:21] that preacher starts harping off this
[56:22] and this and this
[56:26] well can you raise your hands and say i
[56:28] surrender all i'll worship you the way
[56:30] you lie
[56:30] or go find a preacher that won't harp on
[56:33] the things that you don't want him to
[56:34] harp on
[56:38] and i'm not even i'm not even talking
[56:40] about the other things that have
[56:41] preached it could be true as true could
[56:42] be and there could be nothing wrong with
[56:43] any other ministry
[56:45] what's wrong is our desire looking for
[56:48] something that matches our desire
[56:50] and when it matches our desire we'll
[56:52] start dancing with that
[56:57] another church another preacher another
[56:59] ministry
[57:01] or no ministry at all and back to the
[57:04] prophet
[57:10] why what's the motive behind all that i
[57:13] just want it pure
[57:14] i just want it pure and undefiled and i
[57:18] your ears aren't pure and undefiled
[57:21] that may be pure word coming off of that
[57:24] tape but it's not
[57:24] pure ears that are receiving it you need
[57:27] more than that you need a revelation
[57:29] from god
[57:31] [Music]
[57:33] i reject ministers they all mess it up
[57:35] well that's the truth
[57:40] i don't think there's a ministry alive
[57:41] and won't don't say that's true
[57:44] i messed it up but that's the path that
[57:47] he chose that's the method that he chose
[57:49] because he's not going to do it by a
[57:51] perfect preacher perfect church
[57:52] perfect tape he's going to do it by a
[57:55] perfect
[57:56] revelation of a perfect word that's
[57:58] coming through all those mechanisms
[58:00] so that we never dance with the
[58:02] mechanical device
[58:04] we never dance with the veil we never
[58:07] dance with the tabernacle
[58:11] we dance with the word
[58:16] oh i hope you understand what i'm saying
[58:19] i'm saying it as polite and kind as i
[58:22] can
[58:24] because it's something it's not this
[58:26] isn't something you can say
[58:27] oh man i can think of examples there and
[58:29] i can think of examples there
[58:31] if you can't find an example here then
[58:33] you've missed the point of what i'm
[58:34] preaching
[58:40] our tendencies are to denominationalism
[58:47] our tendencies are to fall back on
[58:50] something previous
[58:51] or somewhere else or something solid we
[58:53] can touch
[58:54] look at turn on
[58:59] those are our tendencies to look for
[59:01] something solid
[59:02] a person a ministry a tape a book
[59:06] something that i can dance with
[59:12] but if you're going to dance with christ
[59:13] you're going to join him in an invisible
[59:16] union
[59:18] it's the invisible union it's the
[59:19] private connection between you and him
[59:21] only and nobody nobody else is invited
[59:27] and nobody else is welcome it's you
[59:30] and him alone where something comes in
[59:33] and
[59:33] changes you and and you
[59:37] know that something happened and you've
[59:39] changed and you've met the person of the
[59:41] word you may not be able to describe it
[59:43] you may not put it in language that
[59:44] makes sense to another human being
[59:46] none of that matters but you've had the
[59:47] experience of meeting a supernatural god
[59:50] that has wrought a change in my life
[59:55] in an invisible union and then you dance
[59:58] with that
[59:58] and what is that that is the word made
[1:00:01] manifest
[1:00:02] for our day
[1:00:06] what is the veil the veil is the bride
[1:00:11] amen there's a promise
[1:00:15] in the new testament we talked about
[1:00:17] last time a promise
[1:00:18] of the apostle paul and the apostle paul
[1:00:21] is saying i travail i travail
[1:00:25] with you in birth again
[1:00:28] until christ be formed in you what's he
[1:00:32] saying
[1:00:32] he's saying what is what is paul's
[1:00:35] ministry about what is he working for
[1:00:37] what is he writing to the corinthians
[1:00:38] what is he preaching he's travailing
[1:00:40] until christ be formed in you so there's
[1:00:44] a prophecy there
[1:00:46] that that christ will be formed in you
[1:00:48] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:00:49] that's why brother ben will come right
[1:00:51] back to that scripture
[1:00:53] amen when he preaches christ is the
[1:00:54] mystery of god revealed and he goes
[1:00:56] right back to colossians said christ in
[1:00:58] you
[1:00:58] the hope of glory and so that laid there
[1:01:01] as a prophecy
[1:01:02] amen and it was never fully realized it
[1:01:05] was only partially realized down to the
[1:01:07] church ages
[1:01:08] because they had a holy ghost and
[1:01:09] portion or a dip in the spirit or a
[1:01:11] portion of the spirit
[1:01:13] why did they only have a portion of the
[1:01:14] spirit because they had a portion of the
[1:01:16] word
[1:01:17] and if you have a portion of the word
[1:01:18] you get a portion of the spirit because
[1:01:20] the word and life are the same thing
[1:01:23] that makes sense so now
[1:01:27] there's a time looking ahead to a
[1:01:29] prophecy when it's not going to be
[1:01:30] partial
[1:01:31] but it's going to come in fullness one
[1:01:33] of these days there's going to be a
[1:01:35] manifestation of this promise that he
[1:01:37] will have a bride without spot or
[1:01:39] wrinkle
[1:01:39] that she it'll be christ in you the hope
[1:01:42] of glory
[1:01:42] amen you've been you've been espoused
[1:01:45] into christ but there's coming a time
[1:01:46] that you'll be married to christ
[1:01:49] there's come there's a time when all the
[1:01:51] laboring of paul and all the labor of
[1:01:53] luther and all the labor of wesley and
[1:01:54] all the labor
[1:01:55] it's all the labor is going to be done
[1:01:57] and christ will be formed in the bride
[1:02:00] and those are wonderful scriptures and
[1:02:01] wonderful things to talk about and
[1:02:03] wonderful things in the message amen
[1:02:05] but that word has to come
[1:02:08] into a womb that promise
[1:02:12] just like isaiah's promise had to come
[1:02:14] to life in mary
[1:02:15] amen the promise that abraham had to
[1:02:18] come to life in sarah amen and the
[1:02:20] promise in the new testament
[1:02:22] has to come to life in this day in a
[1:02:25] bride
[1:02:28] and to reject that
[1:02:32] is to reject this
[1:02:37] but every morning i dance with my book
[1:02:44] i dance with my book
[1:02:48] but i'm waiting for the future for
[1:02:49] something to happen
[1:03:00] reading the prophecies of a redeemer
[1:03:03] coming to redeem israel
[1:03:07] looking at christ going to calvary
[1:03:10] nailed on gagatha
[1:03:14] preparing the passover feast
[1:03:18] looking back to a deliverance out of
[1:03:20] egypt
[1:03:22] and knowing that someday they'll come a
[1:03:24] deliverance out of their condition
[1:03:28] and not realizing that that passover
[1:03:30] lamb was hanging on that cross right
[1:03:32] there
[1:03:34] walking by wagging their heads carrying
[1:03:37] the scroll
[1:03:39] with the word written in little boxes on
[1:03:42] their forehead
[1:03:46] walking by with the word rolled up in
[1:03:47] little scrolls and little boxes strapped
[1:03:49] to their forehead
[1:03:50] walking by and wagging their head
[1:03:53] others he saved himself he can't save if
[1:03:56] thou be the son of god
[1:03:57] come down off of that cross with the
[1:03:59] word they so
[1:04:00] loved the word it was scrolled up and in
[1:04:02] a box strapped to their head
[1:04:05] and there was the word being crucified
[1:04:07] the word bleeding the word dying
[1:04:09] for the deliverance that the passover
[1:04:11] lamb was foreshadowing
[1:04:13] the whole feast that they were preparing
[1:04:15] amen he was
[1:04:16] god's lamb for the passover feast for
[1:04:19] the family and they're over here slaying
[1:04:21] lambs at the same time god's lamb is
[1:04:24] dying
[1:04:26] but they loved the ritual so much
[1:04:31] that they rejected the manifestation
[1:04:35] and what went back to the ritual
[1:04:40] right why did
[1:04:44] why did the pharisees loved the ritual
[1:04:47] so much
[1:04:49] because it empowered them
[1:04:53] it gave them purpose it gave them power
[1:04:57] but god forbid you would take all the
[1:04:59] power out of the pulpit and put it back
[1:05:00] in the pew
[1:05:05] god forbid you would do it without the
[1:05:07] priesthood
[1:05:10] god forbid that the lamb of god would
[1:05:13] come
[1:05:14] god forbid he would come and not inform
[1:05:17] the high priest that year
[1:05:20] and not go to the sanhedrin and announce
[1:05:22] his arrival and ask for their permission
[1:05:24] to preach
[1:05:25] and ask them to be partners with him in
[1:05:27] his campaigns
[1:05:30] god forbid it would come humble and
[1:05:32] lonely and go to individuals who were
[1:05:34] cast out
[1:05:36] and set aside
[1:05:41] you see this message came
[1:05:45] not to promote the priesthood
[1:05:49] but it did come to promote a priesthood
[1:05:54] the priesthood of melchizedek
[1:05:55] [Applause]
[1:05:57] and those who are born again by the word
[1:06:00] born again in this day the tabernacle of
[1:06:02] melchizedek
[1:06:04] because it was the high priest that came
[1:06:05] down the tabernacle in flesh
[1:06:08] and now there's a ministry now of
[1:06:10] melchizedek and the ministry of
[1:06:12] melchizedek
[1:06:13] is going on in kings and priests
[1:06:16] you are a king and a priest today
[1:06:19] now over a spiritual kingdom and a
[1:06:22] priest after what order because in the
[1:06:24] original order was priest after the
[1:06:25] order of aaron
[1:06:26] the aaronic priesthood then it became
[1:06:28] the levitical priesthood
[1:06:30] but now it's the melchizedek priesthood
[1:06:32] amen and the only way to be a priest
[1:06:35] in the melchizedek priesthood is to have
[1:06:36] melchizedek living inside of you
[1:06:39] and you become a king and a priest
[1:06:44] see when god called out israel he wanted
[1:06:47] a
[1:06:47] nation of kings and priests is that what
[1:06:50] he wanted
[1:06:51] he wanted a whole nation of kings and
[1:06:53] priests
[1:06:56] but they rejected that and asked for a
[1:06:58] prophet
[1:06:59] and when he asked for a prophet they
[1:07:00] asked for an order because brother ben
[1:07:01] said they wanted something they can do
[1:07:03] anything not to face god as an
[1:07:05] individual
[1:07:08] and so they wanted the order because
[1:07:09] they they could keep the order
[1:07:11] but facing god as an individual was too
[1:07:13] much to ask for
[1:07:17] and so now they get the order they get
[1:07:19] the rituals they get everything they get
[1:07:21] a priesthood
[1:07:21] they get it all but that's not what god
[1:07:24] wanted
[1:07:25] god wanted them all to be a nation of
[1:07:28] priests
[1:07:29] he wanted them all to be princes he
[1:07:31] wanted them all to have their own land
[1:07:34] remember when god comes in when god
[1:07:36] comes in and divides up the land through
[1:07:38] through moses instruction through joshua
[1:07:40] he doesn't come in and he's not setting
[1:07:43] up
[1:07:43] lords and this lord gets all of this
[1:07:45] land and everybody on the land are his
[1:07:47] subjects to feed him and serve him
[1:07:51] that's what man does when he gets land
[1:07:54] but when god gets land god says
[1:07:57] everybody gets their portion
[1:07:59] because he wanted everybody to be a king
[1:08:01] in the land the prince in the land
[1:08:04] right he wanted he wanted everybody they
[1:08:07] get their portion
[1:08:08] according to the size of their family
[1:08:11] not according to their
[1:08:12] rank their seeming rank in society
[1:08:16] it had nothing to do with the rank in
[1:08:18] society they all got an equal portion
[1:08:21] because they all got a
[1:08:22] portion related to their family size
[1:08:27] and that land represents the word
[1:08:31] and god didn't give the word
[1:08:35] to a couple preachers
[1:08:40] and those couple preachers have so much
[1:08:43] territory
[1:08:46] this is my territory and under here i
[1:08:49] got my people
[1:08:51] and my people can live on this land
[1:08:54] and the whole mechanism is to serve the
[1:08:57] king at the top or the lord of the land
[1:09:02] that's what the priesthood became in the
[1:09:05] old testament
[1:09:09] that's what denomination became in the
[1:09:11] new testament
[1:09:13] this is my territory we lutherans have
[1:09:16] this much territory and everybody on
[1:09:18] this territory
[1:09:19] is serving the palace of lutheran
[1:09:24] keeping the system going keeping the
[1:09:26] machinery going
[1:09:27] keeping the army fighting keeping you
[1:09:29] know building the palace
[1:09:32] so that we can say we're the greatest
[1:09:34] kingdom
[1:09:37] oh god smashed that thing
[1:09:41] so you come and send a prophet with a
[1:09:42] seventh grade education
[1:09:45] who refused donations he refused to be
[1:09:48] tight in denominations
[1:09:50] who took the path of rejection
[1:09:56] and he took all of the limelight off of
[1:09:58] himself without denying his position
[1:10:02] and without belittling his place in the
[1:10:04] word
[1:10:05] and he took all of it and he put it on
[1:10:08] the bride
[1:10:11] see when joshua went into the land
[1:10:14] joshua
[1:10:15] because he was the one dividing up the
[1:10:17] land amen
[1:10:18] joshua didn't make sure that he got
[1:10:20] prime real estate
[1:10:24] because that wasn't god's method god
[1:10:26] wanted
[1:10:27] everybody to be a king and a priest that
[1:10:30] was his original plan
[1:10:31] i want everybody to be a king and a
[1:10:33] priest
[1:10:34] and what does god want today he wants a
[1:10:37] nation of kings and priests
[1:10:39] he wants sons and daughters who are
[1:10:41] connected to him
[1:10:42] individually he wants
[1:10:45] he wants you to be a king a priest to
[1:10:48] intercede he wants you to be a
[1:10:51] king he wants you to have a portion of
[1:10:53] this land
[1:10:54] a portion of this word and you know it's
[1:10:56] yours you know it belongs
[1:10:57] you know i i have arrived to my place
[1:11:02] i'm not serving somebody i'm not serving
[1:11:03] a church i'm not serving a ministry i'm
[1:11:05] not serving a movement
[1:11:09] i don't exist
[1:11:12] you see you don't exist to keep the
[1:11:16] doors of this church open
[1:11:19] if god wants to close and look close
[1:11:21] tomorrow
[1:11:23] you don't exist to keep this ministry
[1:11:25] going
[1:11:26] that's not your purpose this building is
[1:11:30] to serve you
[1:11:31] and this ministry is to serve you
[1:11:34] not vice versa
[1:11:40] if we get it out of kilter we're going
[1:11:42] right back to denominationalism where
[1:11:43] we're all working to keep the program
[1:11:45] going
[1:11:46] keep the doors open keep the ministry
[1:11:48] going keep moving moving moving moving
[1:11:50] build another block and a higher wall
[1:11:52] forget all of that stuff the ministry
[1:11:55] amen the
[1:11:56] the all the efforts of a building and a
[1:11:58] place of worship and a place of
[1:11:59] fellowship and a ministry and
[1:12:01] and several ministers of misery it shall
[1:12:02] all be doing one thing encouraging you
[1:12:04] to take your portion of the land and
[1:12:06] live as a king and a priest in the word
[1:12:09] to say i can pray for my sick baby amen
[1:12:11] i can intercede for my loved one
[1:12:13] i can reach god i can come in contact
[1:12:15] face to face with god
[1:12:19] you know if we if we preach any other
[1:12:21] way then we've
[1:12:22] missed amen we've missed the day that we
[1:12:24] live in this isn't about
[1:12:26] amen a ministry anymore the ministry is
[1:12:28] in the bride
[1:12:30] and within the bride there's apostles
[1:12:32] prophets pastors teachers they
[1:12:33] absolutely
[1:12:34] amen they teach and they they they do
[1:12:35] the word absolutely that's what we do
[1:12:37] as a unified body of christ amen but
[1:12:40] we're not here to keep the pastor of the
[1:12:42] apostle a propped up and going
[1:12:44] he's just here as part of the body as
[1:12:46] one of the tools amen
[1:12:48] as one of the team members but what's
[1:12:51] the objective
[1:12:52] what's the goal what day do we live in
[1:12:54] we live in a day
[1:12:56] amen where there's messiahs upon the
[1:12:58] earth there is a restoration of the word
[1:13:00] to bring back
[1:13:01] gods upon this earth gods in flesh
[1:13:06] not not a god with with little minions
[1:13:09] around him
[1:13:09] but that they come out become a kingdom
[1:13:12] of kings and priests
[1:13:13] [Applause]
[1:13:15] that you yourself realize i'm a prince
[1:13:17] with god
[1:13:19] i have dominion i have authority i have
[1:13:23] the word
[1:13:23] the message came for me
[1:13:27] the message speaking of me the word is
[1:13:30] talking of me
[1:13:32] i'm not plugged in to move the program
[1:13:36] the program is here to get me in my
[1:13:38] position
[1:13:41] that's the whole point friends amen for
[1:13:43] each one of us to find our position in
[1:13:45] christ
[1:13:46] and stand in that position amen not to
[1:13:48] keep something going along
[1:13:50] fill a position have a role
[1:13:53] that's all you know there's necessary
[1:13:56] things
[1:13:57] there are necessary things in having a
[1:13:59] church there's necessary things in
[1:14:00] organization there's necessary
[1:14:02] roles to fulfill but that is all here to
[1:14:04] serve a purpose and that purpose
[1:14:06] is to get the bride to rise up and take
[1:14:08] her place
[1:14:09] it's about amen it's about the
[1:14:11] manifestation of jesus christ in
[1:14:13] bright form not the manifestation of
[1:14:15] jesus christ in pulpit form
[1:14:17] [Applause]
[1:14:21] you understand i
[1:14:24] i hope that you see jesus christ behind
[1:14:27] this pulpit
[1:14:29] because i see jesus christ in the pew
[1:14:32] and when i sit in the pew and somebody
[1:14:35] else is behind the pulpit
[1:14:36] i see jesus christ in pulpit and i see
[1:14:38] myself as jesus christ in the pew
[1:14:40] so it doesn't matter if you're in the
[1:14:42] pulpit or the pew there's no difference
[1:14:49] we've got we've got to move away from
[1:14:51] denominationalism and realize
[1:14:54] that if there is a manifestation of
[1:14:56] jesus christ on the earth i'm
[1:14:58] it i cannot
[1:15:01] er there's no possibility of passing
[1:15:04] that off somewhere else and living
[1:15:06] comfortable
[1:15:08] there's no saying there's a
[1:15:09] manifestation in jeffersonville there's
[1:15:11] a manifestation
[1:15:12] over in this big city there's a man
[1:15:15] there's no comfort in that friends
[1:15:17] there's no peace in that there's no rest
[1:15:19] in saying
[1:15:20] i see god over there and i see god over
[1:15:22] there that's not the day
[1:15:23] today is the day to have god in here
[1:15:27] and to become the messiah to become the
[1:15:29] god upon the earth little g
[1:15:34] because he said the he says you call
[1:15:36] them god whom the word of the lord came
[1:15:38] to
[1:15:42] who did the word of the lord come to
[1:15:45] came to a prophet right
[1:15:48] that mighty angel took that book christ
[1:15:52] took the book
[1:15:52] tore the seals off threw him down to the
[1:15:54] seventh church age messenger
[1:15:56] and he gave him to the church
[1:15:59] is that what the prophet said well just
[1:16:02] look at the sequence of events
[1:16:05] so why do i want to hang on
[1:16:09] to the seventh church age messenger and
[1:16:11] make an idol out of that
[1:16:14] because what was given to him was given
[1:16:16] to the church
[1:16:21] so i'll go there and say i think you
[1:16:25] have something for me
[1:16:30] do you understand yeah
[1:16:34] i
[1:16:38] we're all stuck in this condition
[1:16:41] human beings prone to keep falling back
[1:16:44] on these old habits
[1:16:47] but i tell you if worship
[1:16:50] if your worship to god and devotion
[1:16:53] happens on sunday morning
[1:16:55] or on wednesday night you've missed the
[1:16:58] whole plan of god
[1:17:01] you've missed the whole thing if you
[1:17:04] go to church that's not an evil term
[1:17:08] i still say we're going to church but if
[1:17:11] you realize if we don't get our mind
[1:17:12] wrapped in the right spot
[1:17:14] if we're always going to church
[1:17:18] then all of a sudden the church becomes
[1:17:19] the place of worship
[1:17:21] the building itself and the people we
[1:17:23] gather with and that's the place of
[1:17:25] worship
[1:17:26] and we do worship god as he comes forth
[1:17:27] in his revealed word
[1:17:30] but if we're just always going to church
[1:17:33] we've missed the fact that we
[1:17:35] are the church and god's provided place
[1:17:39] of worship and this hour is
[1:17:40] in christ jesus how do you get into him
[1:17:43] by one spirit we're all baptized
[1:17:45] all right okay so now the proper place
[1:17:47] of worship is in christ jesus
[1:17:48] so where is christ jesus in the church
[1:17:52] i in him and him and me
[1:17:56] what day will you know that this day
[1:18:01] so the proper place of worship
[1:18:04] is not in your pew although it's not
[1:18:07] wrong to worship there
[1:18:09] the proper praise of worship is in your
[1:18:10] soul
[1:18:14] when the seed in you the life in you and
[1:18:16] the life of christ
[1:18:17] which is the same thing makes a
[1:18:19] connection in your soul that's the
[1:18:20] proper place of worship
[1:18:22] that's the only provided place of
[1:18:24] worship in this day that is the
[1:18:26] tabernacle that is the temple
[1:18:31] see
[1:18:38] god is a jealous god
[1:18:43] and this day is not like any other day
[1:18:50] when god foreshadowed what he's doing
[1:18:54] he foreshadowed it all the way back in
[1:18:56] eden when he put a son of god on earth
[1:18:59] but part of that son was his wife
[1:19:04] mystery of the seventh seal and he pulls
[1:19:08] out of the man the woman forms her and
[1:19:11] presents this woman back to the man
[1:19:15] right and
[1:19:18] what were they in eden
[1:19:22] co equal
[1:19:30] this message is to take us back to that
[1:19:40] that's a big statement and it's a big
[1:19:43] statement because we can say it here in
[1:19:44] church when we go home and we're like
[1:19:46] uh it's me you know like
[1:19:50] the same guy who messed up yesterday and
[1:19:52] i'm gonna mess up tomorrow and
[1:19:56] that's why we can only have this by
[1:19:58] faith not by what we see
[1:20:01] by faith we believe in god
[1:20:06] is calling us back to what he
[1:20:09] foreshadowed
[1:20:10] and we know we we cannot come into a
[1:20:12] perfect display
[1:20:14] in hybrid flesh but this word has come
[1:20:18] so strong in this day and so much of the
[1:20:20] holy ghost is available
[1:20:22] full measure comes down that that
[1:20:24] measure of the holy ghost quickens our
[1:20:26] mortal body
[1:20:27] and actually brings begins to resurrect
[1:20:30] our body
[1:20:31] now into a resurrected condition
[1:20:34] before the complete body change because
[1:20:36] we are changing
[1:20:37] from glory unto glory
[1:20:41] so it's no longer acceptable to say well
[1:20:43] you know i'm in hybrid flesh you know i
[1:20:45] got these problems
[1:20:46] and you know my mom and dad and blah
[1:20:47] blah blah the level of the word today
[1:20:50] should be taking care of all of those
[1:20:52] problems one after another
[1:20:53] and bringing that body lined up and
[1:20:56] subject to the word
[1:21:00] so we know that there's a time for a
[1:21:02] perfect manifestation
[1:21:04] but we should be growing into a perfect
[1:21:07] manifestation
[1:21:08] not sitting and waiting for a perfect
[1:21:10] manifestation to come someday
[1:21:15] every revelation every bit of the word
[1:21:17] unfolding
[1:21:18] all of the unlocking of the word should
[1:21:21] be lining this flesh
[1:21:23] up to jesus christ's word and
[1:21:24] manifesting who's on the inside
[1:21:27] and when the word comes listen i if we
[1:21:30] could just change our thinking
[1:21:31] if you'll notice i haven't read a
[1:21:33] scripture and i haven't looked at a note
[1:21:34] since i got up here because this is all
[1:21:37] straight from heaven
[1:21:39] because i never planned on saying any of
[1:21:41] this but when that word comes friends
[1:21:43] the word the revelation comes it doesn't
[1:21:46] come inside of you and build another
[1:21:47] building block
[1:21:50] that revelation comes to unlock the word
[1:21:52] that's already
[1:21:54] on the inside amen
[1:21:57] faith is there a perfect body is there
[1:22:00] everything that we have need of is
[1:22:02] already in us
[1:22:03] before life's journey began it's locked
[1:22:06] in the dna of god that's down in the
[1:22:08] soul
[1:22:09] and so the revelation of the word is
[1:22:11] coming sounding a certain
[1:22:13] sound amen so it can get a harmonic
[1:22:15] frequency out of the dna
[1:22:20] i understand that's why we have to keep
[1:22:23] moving when the light moves
[1:22:24] that's why we can't go back and dance
[1:22:26] amen with 1200 tapes and say
[1:22:28] i've got the message i've got the
[1:22:30] message if you don't have the one who
[1:22:32] gave the message you don't have the
[1:22:34] message
[1:22:34] if you don't have connection with the
[1:22:36] mighty angel you don't
[1:22:38] have the message you can have every book
[1:22:40] you can
[1:22:41] put them under your mattress you can
[1:22:42] sleep on them at night you can eat the
[1:22:44] very literal pages out of your bible but
[1:22:46] if you don't have the mighty angel who
[1:22:48] brought the open book
[1:22:50] you do not have the message
[1:22:54] if the message isn't in you you don't
[1:22:56] have the message
[1:23:00] and so what's the word do do i have to
[1:23:02] understand all these things
[1:23:04] and if it's so complicated it's not
[1:23:05] about understanding all these things
[1:23:07] it's about the revelation of the word
[1:23:08] taking your bible and showing the day
[1:23:11] that we live in
[1:23:12] here and here and here and here what's
[1:23:15] it doing
[1:23:16] why why do we have to go through all the
[1:23:17] old testament stories why do we have to
[1:23:19] show the seventh seal
[1:23:20] and genesis and then have a cook and
[1:23:22] then song of solomon and
[1:23:26] why so it can unlock that seventh seal
[1:23:29] that's down inside of you
[1:23:30] so it's more faith and more faith and
[1:23:32] more faith what's the preaching of the
[1:23:34] word doing
[1:23:34] unlike unlocking the potential that's
[1:23:37] already laying on the inside
[1:23:42] so that it doesn't become i need the
[1:23:45] preacher to give me something
[1:23:48] to add to i'm going and asking god
[1:23:53] to open up so so that i can live to my
[1:23:57] full potential
[1:24:00] you realize luther could not live a
[1:24:02] sanctified life
[1:24:03] because the word of sanctification
[1:24:05] wasn't being preached
[1:24:08] but luther had the seed of god on the
[1:24:10] inside
[1:24:13] do you understand that brother said
[1:24:15] luther had the same holy ghost you've
[1:24:17] got
[1:24:17] yes that's a tough one to swallow
[1:24:23] but luther although because brother ben
[1:24:26] said if
[1:24:27] luther and wesley and them if they
[1:24:28] reformers would have went on further
[1:24:30] they would have got to this
[1:24:32] why because they had all of this down in
[1:24:35] the sea gene of god
[1:24:38] but only the portion for that day could
[1:24:41] be
[1:24:42] unlocked by the word for that day so the
[1:24:45] word for that day
[1:24:46] unlocked the manifestation for that day
[1:24:49] because the word
[1:24:50] unlocks the potential
[1:24:54] so when a message of justification comes
[1:24:56] a revelation of justification now they
[1:24:58] can begin to live a manifestation of
[1:25:00] justification
[1:25:01] but he can't live the manifestation of
[1:25:03] sanctification
[1:25:05] although it's in him
[1:25:09] do you believe that was in him it was in
[1:25:11] luther if luther was the seed of god
[1:25:13] all all that was in god was in luther
[1:25:16] amen
[1:25:17] in portion that's why if luther would
[1:25:21] have went on he'd have been sitting in
[1:25:22] the sea here preaching in the pulpit
[1:25:24] here
[1:25:28] and so that's what's so dangerous about
[1:25:30] denominationalism
[1:25:31] when the lutheran stopped they stopped
[1:25:34] the potential in the manifestation for
[1:25:35] that day
[1:25:36] because god was bringing another level
[1:25:38] of revelation amen to unlock
[1:25:40] more of what was laying in that seed
[1:25:42] amen so the church
[1:25:43] the bride could have a greater
[1:25:45] manifestation to move from stock to move
[1:25:47] to tassel
[1:25:49] what brought it from stock to tassel the
[1:25:51] revelation of the word for their day
[1:25:54] then moved to the pentecostal age and
[1:25:56] now to here
[1:25:59] so the lutherans are still dancing with
[1:26:01] their book
[1:26:04] and the wesleyans are dancing with their
[1:26:06] book
[1:26:09] the pentecostals are dancing
[1:26:13] with their revelation of the book
[1:26:18] and people in message churches are
[1:26:20] dancing with 1200 tapes
[1:26:26] do you understand what i'm saying not
[1:26:29] belittling anybody i'm pointing the
[1:26:30] finger at us
[1:26:34] let's dance with the word the person of
[1:26:37] the word that wants to live inside of
[1:26:39] his bride
[1:26:41] why why
[1:26:49] why does it have to be so hard why such
[1:26:53] rejection and ridicule and scorn and
[1:26:55] why why can't we just preach a simple
[1:26:58] message like
[1:26:59] every other church preaches and just be
[1:27:00] normal and be accepted
[1:27:07] why why can't we just stick in 1963 and
[1:27:11] stay there
[1:27:14] why do we have to be pushing the edge of
[1:27:16] the light
[1:27:21] why why can't we just be happy
[1:27:25] with 1200 tapes and books and god sent a
[1:27:27] prophet
[1:27:29] why why can't that just be satisfying to
[1:27:32] us
[1:27:35] the same reason the wesleyans had to
[1:27:37] preach more than the lutherans
[1:27:43] that message was given to us and that
[1:27:46] message brought the full revelation of
[1:27:48] jesus christ
[1:27:50] it's in the message if it's
[1:27:53] in the message it's for me
[1:27:57] if brother branham preached it it's for
[1:27:59] the bride
[1:28:02] there's a reason he said it there's a
[1:28:05] reason he preached it
[1:28:07] there's a reason it's on tape there's a
[1:28:09] reason it's in a book
[1:28:10] there's a reason we have it not so that
[1:28:12] we can play it safe
[1:28:14] stand back don't get too close to the
[1:28:16] edge so that we don't fall off
[1:28:18] so we just stay within a certain uh a
[1:28:20] certain segment of the message that's
[1:28:22] declared
[1:28:22] safe and honorable
[1:28:29] but there's more potential
[1:28:32] the message came to unlock the full
[1:28:35] potential of a full bride
[1:28:37] who will be who will be him
[1:28:42] she will be so much like him she will be
[1:28:45] him
[1:28:48] my brother said i believe that i believe
[1:28:50] i'm just going to stay here i'm just
[1:28:52] going to stay with my tapes
[1:28:53] i'm going to dance with the books and
[1:28:54] someday when god wants that
[1:28:56] then god will turn me into that
[1:29:00] how did god move lutherans to wesleyans
[1:29:08] he opened another portion of the word
[1:29:13] how did he move lutherans to
[1:29:15] pentecostals he took another portion of
[1:29:17] the word
[1:29:19] and how does he move his bride in the
[1:29:21] program he keeps
[1:29:22] taking that message and opening it up
[1:29:25] and opening it up
[1:29:26] not a new message not a new messenger
[1:29:28] the prophet and the bride and the spirit
[1:29:30] have to be saying the same thing
[1:29:32] amen we cannot add to or
[1:29:35] take away we cannot add to
[1:29:39] or refuse to look at
[1:29:43] amen we cannot add to or stay away from
[1:29:47] because it's dangerous and somebody else
[1:29:48] went down that road and they fell off a
[1:29:49] cliff and died
[1:29:54] sometimes i think adding to is deadly
[1:29:57] but sometimes what about staying away
[1:29:59] from is that could that be deadly too
[1:30:05] god was displeased with israel because
[1:30:07] israel didn't fully possess their land
[1:30:12] and you know because it got hard
[1:30:14] possessing the land
[1:30:15] that was great we got land milk and
[1:30:17] honey
[1:30:18] milk and honey
[1:30:22] we're on our way to a land with milk and
[1:30:26] honey i'm gonna get my own part i'm
[1:30:28] gonna be a king
[1:30:31] but you're gonna have to fight for every
[1:30:32] inch you're going to drive out the
[1:30:34] inhabitants fight it off from raiders
[1:30:41] god has opened up the land for us
[1:30:44] he's taken the seals off the book and
[1:30:46] opened up the entire bible
[1:30:50] the message came amen not to start a new
[1:30:53] denomination with a new tabernacle a new
[1:30:56] temple and new dimensions on new land
[1:30:59] so that we can build new walls out of
[1:31:01] new doctrinal beliefs
[1:31:03] so that we can do the same thing the
[1:31:04] lutherans the wesleys and the
[1:31:05] pentecostals did
[1:31:09] but it came to open up the land it came
[1:31:11] to open up the bible
[1:31:13] so that we could have the whole thing
[1:31:20] someday god's going to crank that great
[1:31:22] lever in the sky
[1:31:24] and my body's going to change
[1:31:27] brother madam said the rapture is a
[1:31:29] revelation
[1:31:31] and a revelation comes by the word
[1:31:37] it's not going to be the magic moment
[1:31:39] when all of a sudden god does it all
[1:31:41] he's doing it now he's resurrecting us
[1:31:44] now he's rapturing us up now he's
[1:31:46] changing us now
[1:31:48] we're moving from glory to glory as he
[1:31:50] opens the book
[1:31:51] and shows it to us now
[1:31:55] why is it so hard because canaanites
[1:31:59] never wanted to give up their territory
[1:32:00] to begin with
[1:32:03] brother said those were demon powers
[1:32:06] canaanites and philistines and hittites
[1:32:08] they they're in the land trying to keep
[1:32:10] you from possessing the land because
[1:32:11] when the bride fully possesses the land
[1:32:13] and catches the full revelation of the
[1:32:14] full word
[1:32:16] and who she really is
[1:32:20] then the rapture will go is that right
[1:32:24] the raptures come but we're taking the
[1:32:27] land
[1:32:28] so the rapture can go amen
[1:32:33] see denominationalism
[1:32:38] starts off playing it safe
[1:32:45] then builds a wall
[1:32:49] then defends its castle
[1:32:56] and then declares war
[1:33:02] i'm not interested
[1:33:05] i want the word i want every morsel and
[1:33:09] portion that's for me
[1:33:11] i want every crumb i want every piece of
[1:33:13] land
[1:33:14] i want every leaf i want every blade of
[1:33:16] grass i want every stream
[1:33:18] i want everything that god has opened
[1:33:20] for us today i want it today first
[1:33:22] it is the revelation of that word that
[1:33:25] will
[1:33:26] quicken my mortal body how do you know
[1:33:29] it's
[1:33:29] quickening it now
[1:33:40] sometimes it's not a good thing to be
[1:33:43] raised in the message
[1:33:46] and there's certain things that are
[1:33:47] wonderful about it a lot of heartache
[1:33:49] that you're spared a lot of
[1:33:52] but it's so much easier then for it to
[1:33:55] become
[1:33:55] a ritual a religious motion of
[1:33:59] action just
[1:34:02] this has become normal
[1:34:08] but we got to push past all of that and
[1:34:10] say i don't want what's normal
[1:34:14] i don't i don't want to believe what
[1:34:16] i've been taught to believe
[1:34:17] all my life i want to believe him i
[1:34:19] don't want to embrace
[1:34:20] a set of guidelines and doctrines
[1:34:24] i want to dance with him
[1:34:27] i want to know him on a personal level
[1:34:31] i want him to quicken me to life
[1:34:34] and i want to dance with him
[1:34:38] not my church not my family's religion
[1:34:43] i wonder how many people are message
[1:34:46] believers because their whole family is
[1:34:47] message believers
[1:34:54] i wonder how many people go to a church
[1:34:55] because they all their life went to that
[1:34:58] church
[1:35:01] hey that's religion
[1:35:06] but what we want is not religion we want
[1:35:09] him
[1:35:11] say lord i don't want to dance with my
[1:35:12] church and i don't want to dance in my
[1:35:14] family's tradition
[1:35:15] i don't want to dance with generational
[1:35:17] belief i want to dance with you
[1:35:21] i want to dance with the person of the
[1:35:22] word i want to rejoice in the word for
[1:35:25] my day
[1:35:25] i want to see it i want to know it i
[1:35:27] want to be
[1:35:28] it
[1:35:33] see friends this morning
[1:35:36] nothing that i've said has been on my
[1:35:37] notes but it's in my heart
[1:35:41] it's all in my heart the hour that we
[1:35:44] live is not for any more
[1:35:46] playing games there's no more playing
[1:35:47] games there's no more playing church
[1:35:48] there's no more pretending or something
[1:35:50] we're not
[1:35:52] right we're coming into full
[1:35:53] manifestation whether you like it or not
[1:35:55] we are coming to full manifestation
[1:36:00] now it's time to say god let me move
[1:36:02] past
[1:36:04] the veil past the tapes
[1:36:07] past the app passed the books
[1:36:10] past my written bible

[1:36:16] move
[1:36:17] past the words i can comprehend in
[1:36:19] english
[1:36:21] and move past all of that and break in
[1:36:23] behind the veil
[1:36:24] and let me see you for who you are right
[1:36:27] now unveil yourself to me almighty god
[1:36:30] not in a form but in a person
[1:36:33] and let me grab a hold of that person
[1:36:36] and dance with the word
[1:36:38] and recognize whatever it is
[1:36:41] i am to

[1:37:37] that i am she yeah well brother brennan
[1:37:40] was preaching about he was preaching
[1:37:41] about me

[1:37:44] the bride christ and the bride
[1:37:46] he's talking about me all that scripture
[1:37:49] that all that that foreshadowed all the
[1:37:52] way back in genesis chapter three
[1:37:54] saying that there's going to be a seed
[1:37:55] of the woman come forth amen isaiah
[1:37:57] declared it and that all the prophets
[1:37:59] declared

[1:38:23] mary

[1:38:26] most blessed among all women

[1:38:29] lowly condition and he is
[1:38:31] he he has lifted me on high can you say
[1:38:34] the same thing
[1:38:35] all those prophecies of the new
[1:38:36] testament all that paul was laboring for

[1:38:40] day it's right here

[1:39:20] desire of my heart
[1:39:21] the reality of a love relationship with
[1:39:24] the person not a devotion
[1:39:27] not a duty not a place of worship not a
[1:39:30] form of religion
[1:39:31] but let it be the person that i danced
[1:39:35] through life with
[1:39:36] the person of the word
[1:39:41] what did we think the full reality of
[1:39:43] the world was going to be like
[1:39:49] big giant meeting
[1:39:52] big displays of great power
[1:39:57] those things may come they may or may
[1:39:59] not i don't know
[1:40:03] but it's going to come down to the
[1:40:04] individual
[1:40:06] connected with god knowing who he or she
[1:40:09] is with absolute confidence in god
[1:40:13] and in their position
[1:40:17] and whatever he wants to do from there
[1:40:19] he'll do
[1:40:21] signs and wonders ridicule and scorn
[1:40:23] whatever he wants to do from there
[1:40:25] he'll do but what he's trying to get is
[1:40:27] preeminence
[1:40:30] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:40:33] in this hour it's the only thing that
[1:40:36] matters

[1:41:02] lord jesus we thank you for the reality
[1:41:06] of your word

[1:41:12] it leaves us all unveiled lorne

[1:41:22] religion
[1:41:23] no covering we only want to be covered
[1:41:27] by your word for this hour
[1:41:30] god if there's any here lord who has
[1:41:33] been embracing the building
[1:41:35] embracing the tapes embracing the books
[1:41:37] embracing a physical bible
[1:41:40] but have not yet embraced you the person
[1:41:42] of the word
[1:41:43] i pray god that you would quicken
[1:41:45] something inside of them now
[1:41:47] draw them lord and pull them to yourself
[1:41:51] so that they'll move past the outer
[1:41:53] court past the holy place
[1:41:56] past the golden altar of incense and

[1:46:12] of god in
[1:46:16] his righteousness

[1:46:27] you
[1:46:29] oh hallelujah
[1:46:35] one more time
[1:46:40] the kingdom of god
[1:46:44] and his righteousness and
[1:46:52] all these
[1:46:54] [Applause]
[1:47:01] [Applause]
[1:47:06] god bless your friends i love you all
[1:47:10] and god just had some things to say this
[1:47:13] morning
[1:47:13] [Music]
[1:47:14] and i pray you understand my heart
[1:47:18] i'm a message believer through and
[1:47:19] through but because
[1:47:21] i'm a son of god i'm a message believer
[1:47:26] there will be many self-proclaimed
[1:47:28] message believers
[1:47:30] that were self-proclaimed with an
[1:47:32] intellectual
[1:47:33] faith in the message but the real
[1:47:36] message believers
[1:47:38] were ordained to be message believers
[1:47:39] before the foundation of the world
[1:47:42] because god's objective was not for you
[1:47:44] to believe the message
[1:47:48] god's objective was for you to be the
[1:47:50] mess
[1:47:54] god's whole plan was not to get you to
[1:47:56] believe in the opening of the seventh
[1:47:57] seal
[1:48:00] the whole plan comes down to this
[1:48:03] you being the revelation of the seventh
[1:48:07] well i believe this and i believe that
[1:48:09] and i believe that that's wonderful
[1:48:11] if it's intellectual if you pieced it
[1:48:13] together through what was preached or
[1:48:14] what you were read
[1:48:15] that will do you no good
[1:48:20] but the reality of who you are
[1:48:22] [Music]
[1:48:24] will draw you to this light and this
[1:48:27] light will quicken the full potential of
[1:48:29] who you already
[1:48:31] are the message didn't come to make you
[1:48:34] bride
[1:48:35] to make you a son of god the message
[1:48:38] come to identify
[1:48:40] who you already were
[1:48:44] and it came to unlock the potential
[1:48:47] that's in that word the most important
[1:48:50] thing is to be a son or daughter of god
[1:48:52] to come from the mind of god
[1:48:56] that's what he's after sons and
[1:48:58] daughters of god
[1:49:00] himself in flesh in this day
[1:49:04] manifested in bright form that was his
[1:49:07] objective
[1:49:09] and he's accomplishing it in his people
[1:49:14] don't just be a message believer
[1:49:18] don't just be in love with the bible
[1:49:22] be in love with him and let him
[1:49:25] be alive in you that's the whole purpose
[1:49:30] of the whole thing friends
[1:49:33] god bless you let's sing again
[1:49:37] me and me and shall not live by
[1:49:42] bread alone
[1:49:46] but by every word
[1:49:53] that proceeds from
[1:49:56] the mouth of god
[1:50:00] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:50:06] [Music]
[1:50:08] asked
[1:50:10] be given unto you
[1:50:14] seek and ye shall
[1:50:18] find
[1:50:21] knock and it shall be
[1:50:24] opened
[1:50:32] [Music]
[1:50:36] hallelujah
[1:50:38] kingdom of god
[1:50:41] and his righteousness
[1:50:48] and all these things shall be
[1:50:52] added
[1:50:55] oh hallelujah
