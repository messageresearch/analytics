[0:00] and all around the bride amen god is
[0:03] manifesting his word but
[0:05] life is just going on
[0:09] but it won't always just go on like that
[0:12] it'll come to an abrupt stop judgment is
[0:15] here judgment is upon the earth
[0:16] and god has provided a place and that
[0:19] place is in christ jesus it's the only
[0:21] ark of safety
[0:23] and there's a bride here who is working
[0:25] and laboring in that word in that ark of
[0:28] safety
[0:29] christ the revealed word of the hour and
[0:31] she's laboring in it she's giving it out
[0:32] she's manifesting she's living it
[0:34] amen so that others can see this is the
[0:37] ark come into it it's the message of the
[0:39] hour
[0:39] it's christ our lord it's your
[0:41] bridegroom it's your husband the
[0:43] revealed word
[0:45] and we're laboring in it how are we
[0:46] preaching are we all preachers of
[0:48] righteousness how are we preaching we're
[0:50] preaching by building the ark
[0:52] noah was preaching by taking the lumber
[0:54] making boards
[0:55] nailing them pitching them like the lord
[0:57] told him what was he doing
[0:59] he was preaching the gospel by living
[1:01] the manifestation of the word
[1:05] and when god through a prophetic gift
[1:07] has come and told us
[1:08] what what the bible says about our
[1:10] conduct our dress our attitude our
[1:12] action our faith our doctrine amen when
[1:15] we take
[1:15] all of that and we materialize it
[1:18] through a daily life
[1:19] it's the same thing as noah nailing
[1:21] another board on the wall
[1:24] when we refuse to go along with
[1:26] everybody at work that is cheating the
[1:27] company out of money but we say that's
[1:29] not honest amen that wouldn't be
[1:30] pleasing to my lord what are you doing
[1:32] you're nailing another board on the ark
[1:35] when a woman refuses to take the
[1:37] fashions of the day
[1:38] amen even if it causes her to be looked
[1:41] at or scoring but she stays with the
[1:43] revealed word of the hour on how she
[1:44] dresses and how she acts
[1:46] when she refuses to cut her hair when
[1:48] she refuses to put on makeup amen what
[1:50] is she doing she's nailing another board
[1:52] on the ark
[1:54] when a man will live selfless for his
[1:56] family and he'll bring up his children
[1:58] in the fear and admonition of the lord
[2:00] what's he doing he's nailing another
[2:01] border on the ark
[2:02] when a woman will faithfully reverence
[2:04] her husband and serve him as unto the
[2:06] lord
[2:06] what's she doing she's nailing another
[2:08] board on the ark
[2:11] so that this world will be without
[2:13] excuse just as the world in that day was
[2:15] without excuse
[2:16] because there was a man there who told
[2:17] him the truth and he manifest his faith
[2:20] in that truth before them
[2:22] and there's a people on the earth today
[2:24] that not just believes the word but they
[2:26] take the word and they manifest that
[2:28] word to everybody around them
[2:31] and their conduct their attitude their
[2:33] temperament their speech
[2:34] their dress amen in every way in every
[2:38] facet of life
[2:38] they bring that body they bring it
[2:40] subject to the word
[2:42] and when they bring it subject to the
[2:43] word what are they doing they're being a
[2:45] preacher of righteousness because this
[2:47] message of this hour
[2:48] is the ark of safety
