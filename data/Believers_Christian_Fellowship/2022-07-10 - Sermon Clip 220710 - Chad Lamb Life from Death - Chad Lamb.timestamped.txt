[0:00] then you realized
[0:02] i'm nothing
[0:04] i have no power i have no strength i
[0:06] have no ability you know you start off
[0:08] i'm the bride of jesus christ amen you
[0:11] are the bride of jesus christ but if
[0:12] you're acting as the bride serving your
[0:14] own purpose in this life he'll let that
[0:16] vision die in you until you wonder
[0:19] whether you're bright or not
[0:21] he'll let you get sidelined he'll let
[0:23] you get weighed laid he'll let you fall
[0:25] on your face god will let you die to
[0:27] your dream of being bride until you
[0:30] realize that you're nothing without him
[0:32] you're not bribed by your merit you're
[0:34] not bribed by your good looks you're not
[0:36] bribed by your wisdom or intellect
[0:38] you're not bright because of your good
[0:39] understanding you're bribed by his
[0:41] election and his election only and it
[0:43] was a purpose he purposed in you before
[0:45] the foundation of the world and the
[0:46] minute you stop serving his purpose and
[0:48] start serving your own purpose he'll let
[0:51] your dream of bride die
[0:53] until you find yourself in sin you find
[0:55] yourself in compromise you find yourself
[0:57] in confusion and you wonder who am i am
[1:00] i even until god will come to you and
[1:02] say you're my bride and you say who am i
[1:04] that i should be your bride who am i
[1:11] and this this this death is for a
[1:14] purpose amen we've got to die sometimes
[1:17] to our wrong thinking to our wrong ideas
[1:19] sometimes our children are raised down
[1:21] and we tell them you're a bride and
[1:22] you're this and you're that amen don't
[1:24] be too scared when god lets them fall
[1:27] flat amen don't be too nervous because
[1:29] god needs to break some of that wrong
[1:32] understanding till they can die to their
[1:34] concept of what it means
[1:36] to be bride die sometimes to their own
[1:39] ideas being raised in perfection being
[1:41] raised in the word amen some of them may
[1:43] have the wrong idea
[1:46] not all of them some of them have the
[1:48] right idea but if some of them have the
[1:50] wrong idea god is going to get his
[1:53] resurrection power on display
[1:58] and he'll let our vision sometimes of
[2:00] who we are die he'll let our
[2:02] understanding sometimes of who we are
[2:05] die
[2:07] just like he let paul
[2:09] die
[2:10] to his old life just like he let moses
[2:13] die
[2:15] so that he can bring a resurrection
[2:18] then all of a sudden in the resurrection
[2:22] when god begins to say you're my bride
[2:25] i want you to be a witness in the world
[2:27] you say who am i to be a witness you
[2:29] know i can't do anything right you know
[2:31] i'm a failure to start with you know i
[2:33] can't speak right you know i can't keep
[2:35] the doctrine dry you know i still don't
[2:36] feel like i completely understand
[2:38] everything
[2:42] praise be to god
[2:44] when you get to that place you're just
[2:46] about right
