========================================

[Music] [Music] more had it all but what i need is just [Music] [Music] more is that your prayer this it morning but what i eat is and yeah can we just sing i love him this time though with no instruments other than your voices musicians if that's okay [Music] uh [Music] now [Music] amen love him amen i love him thank you musicians i really appreciate it uh hello sorry so the surprise it was just as much surprise for you it's a bigger surprise for me i promise you to be here but i'm thankful to the lord that he'd give me the opportunity one more time to surrender this vessel to hopefully bring honor and glory to him and to be able to say something that will help you this morning and that's what i'm trusting and that's the faith that i that gives me the faith to come to the pulpit with a few days notice is this one thing i know i love him and i love this word and i love you and if i didn't love you i would never come to this pulpit i just couldn't do it because i couldn't help you there's nothing i could do to help you but when i know that i got that in line this makes me love you in line too right so i'd just like to take a little thought this morning that was kind of something that helped me a little inspiration for me and i like those little thoughts sometimes you know god hides himself in simplicity sometimes he does things in just such a way you would think how could something so little have such a big effect but he does it all the time he just does things like that and it it creates a humility amongst the believers and it creates such a confidence i know he's mindful of me he's thinking of me and he was he was with me this weekend and i just i knew he was um and this i was just at home you know and friday preparing for the youth meeting because i prepare for youth meetings just like i would prepare for coming here i sure love those youth and i want to be found faithful sanctifying this vessel for their sake so that they they can have something that would be a help to them on a on a friday and you know and but i noticed the thought that i was on just just did something it did something in my home and and the thought kept carrying on to saturday and i could tell and i didn't want to say anything to carrie but i passed by and she was in the bathroom there for a minute and i thought i wonder if she notices that and it's just a thought in my mind i could feel his presence just real strong and so i never said anything to her i just went and sat down because i thought you know if i say something to it she'll read into it a little bit about eight o'clock at night she comes and sits down and i was reading her praying in the chair and she said you you noticed that in the house i said yeah yeah i do she's like i was wondering it just she said do you feel that atmosphere i said yeah i feel it she said it's she said it's have an effect on the kids and if anybody knows my little eliana you know her she is she's a ball of energy and joy and uh but even she was acting funny we caught carrie said she caught her a couple times over and praying that's just strange you know and it just was a strange atmosphere and and i and i and i realized it was something in what i was looking at and even the friday night youth meeting i was so tore up i could barely speak the kids i was crying the whole time and i'm like how could such a little thing have such a big effect but i realized something and that's the thing i just want to share with you tonight i i believe that um he's teaching us something he's showing us there's a way to conquer every fear every doubt every temptation that this world could ever anything the devil could ever throw at you there's something that can overcome but it's just so simple it's just so humble and uh and it'll do things in your home it'll do things amongst your marriage it'll do things for your kids that you never thought possible and all your efforts and struggles and trials you just kind of relax because when he comes on the scene everything else just kind of falls in line everything just works its way out and i know i'm not saying it right but i know what happened in this weekend and i'll tell you something else i i was you know then when brother chad called me i said well it might have been good for the youth but you know to bring that to mature sons and daughters of god you know the royal priesthood i mean how could i how could i bring it to them and i went to prayer again and i said lord you know i maybe i you know i should go a different direction i'll bring something to him that really be taking new ground you know for the people you know and so i went to prayer and i got back up and i just walked out of the bedroom i said now is that his will or your will i said well i don't know i like to take new ground for the for the people maybe it'd help him more and i went and sat down and i i said you know but the inspiration is only leading me one way and so i typed in you know we do all this we google search sometimes our questions are not google search we message search but we don't google search now that's what the world does yeah we don't do that but i put in there i put in when inspiration strikes and i and what popped up was um trying to do god a service without it being his will and it was david you look it up 1965 when inspiration strikes it was david brother brown said inspiration struck him to go get the ark but it wasn't right and you keep reading down through there and it was it was micah i'm sorry it was ahab and they wanted to take the land remember he said inspiration struck it was absolutely inspiration that struck them but it wasn't in line with the word and he said there was an evil spirit that came up from underneath a deceiving spirit he said they're so organized i can come in you go look at the quote i can come in and work up their emotions and they'll be deceived by it 1965 trying to do god of service so i don't want to be led by my emotions i don't think any of us want to be led by emotions they have an effect but i don't want to be led by them i want to be led by divine revelation and that holy spirit that can lead a lamb wherever he wants me to go that's just where i want to go so let's go so just relax it's it's just uh it's just me sharing my heart tonight this morning so why don't you turn in your bibles to first peter chapter four first peters chapter 4 verse 1. it says for as much then as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves prepare yourselves arm yourselves likewise yourself likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god for in the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness and lusts and excessive wine revelings banquetings and abominable idolatries wherein they think it's strange that ye run not with them in the same excess of riot speaking evil of you who shall give an account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to the god in the spirit but the end of all things is at hand be therefore sober and watch unto prayer and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover a multitude of sins and also turn in your bibles to first john chapter 4 16. first john chapter 4 16. these two portions of the scripture i find they parallel each other it says we have known and believed the love that god hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth thou fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us if any man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar and he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen just bow our heads heavenly father lord we just come before you lord with grateful hearts lord that in your mercy and your grace from before the foundation in the world you ordained us to stand here this day and lord i'm so thankful lord that you came by my way one day lord you came by the others that before me one day lord we we weren't looking for you but you came looking for us lord to think of how you were so great and so mighty and you were mindful of a sinner like me a sinner like us lord nothing worthy to to be seen by the king but lord you saw us and lord we've gathered here because we have a confidence lord that you're here in our midst lord we have a confidence that you'll speak through flesh that makes mistakes father you'll hear through flesh that makes mistakes but lord we're being conformed into your image day by day through many sufferings and many trials lord i just pray lord this morning that we could see you face to face because lord the time has come and the hour is here we're no longer looking through a glass dimly father but we're seeing you face to face and all that you are the potential now lies in us to be i pray lord god that you would move have the preeminence take my inabilities lord and my broken up words lord do the supernatural thing amongst your peaceful lord we love you we commit this time into your hands in jesus name amen amen you may be seated so i like to just give this thought a title as he is so are we conquered and conquering as he is so are we conquered and conquering and you see here that um that it says here that in this day of judgment brother chad mentioned you know this the the tremendous chaos and and the uh the fear that's amongst the people and in the land and the anger and the fierceness and this shouldn't take us by surprise it's the day of judgment it's the day of judgment and everything is falling apart around you this doesn't shake us nor are we even concerned with it because for them it's judgment but for us it's the redeeming power of god coming to set us free and at that same time when in that day of judgment we can see very clear here that perfect love begins to manifest because brother branham said when he went beyond the curtain of time only perfect love can enter into this place and danny henry wrote a prophecy and he said and this shall make and come to bring to pass a tremendous victory in the love divine and you know i took that little thought you know me i'm very simple in my mind and i took that thought you know on that picture and sometimes we go back and we look at the picture on the box so we can put the pieces in the right position we have to do that sometimes brother branham said if you see your cow up in the tree eating grass you know you got something wrong with your picture and uh you know for me sometimes i said those straight edges you know remember i need i need something simple for me right i said you know there's those absolute those are straight edges i know this is a great victory of love divine amongst his people i know this entire message is a great victory but you can't have a victory without a great battle you have to have a great battle and you have to have a tremendous enemy before you for it to really be a tremendous victory but the tremendous victory is divine love conquers and divine love can only conquer if divine love has conquered you you know divine love conquered the lord jesus christ so much so that he said it's not my will be done it's thine will be done and that divine love g god brother banham said that divine love that god had produced christ and he gave himself for you and me that that divine love has always been sacrificial that divine love seeketh not itself right it vaunteth not of itself it isn't puffed up it isn't prideful it's so simple it's so humble it abases itself he the greatest of all that's what made him king that's what made him god that he could come down in such a form a human flesh like you and me take on a form that is filthy in the eyes of god like we would like we would say who would want to be a cockroach right i wouldn't want to be a cockroach that's a nasty little thing but god is so much higher you can imagine billion times the difference between that and what we are in the eyes of god he said i love them so much i want to come and live amongst them because if i don't they're lost and i've got to come so that i can redeem them back unto me and i started thinking of this you know and there's not a one of us that doesn't understand the effects of divine love and a couple months ago you know i i got a little bit down we all get down we go through things right and i'm a little bit melancholy in my nature so i have my highs and i have my lows but i was just really down and i'll tell you what got me there was i thought you know how many times i've now flown oh across the other side of the world now maybe four times and i've i got to thinking you know all the people i've witnessed to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people and i started looking i said where's the effects of it so many people they just disregard the truth like i tell them and i tell them with everything that's in me the sincerity and love that i have and it you can tell it's just cold it doesn't have the effect it just and it just did something to me it made me just kind of want to pull back it made me start losing my feeling for people and i don't want to lose my feeling for people because i know the love that i have toward god is starting to wax cold when i start to lose my love for people and i want to pull away from people because he said if you say you love god whom you can't see and you can see the ones you're walking with and you don't love them you're deceived you don't actually love god you're doing it for some other reason you're doing it for some other motive i don't come here to preach because i want a name i could care less i don't even want to be called a preacher i almost would rather just mess up my words just put it in such a way that you'll never recognize and exalt kyle i'm not worthy to be exalted there's none good amongst us only god and so when i get to thinking of those things and i just start to think you know i start getting down i was like lord with everything in me i'm trying i'm doing everything i can my family those that i love you love them so much it just tears you to pieces you don't even know you've done you've what more can you do you've shared it you've broken it down in so many ways it just gets you to a point you just get so discouraged and they get more cold towards you they get less and you can see i i know men that i've sat and prayed with that had major problems and god come down and supernaturally change the scene for them so much so they'll come and they're not even believers come back and say right there when you pray and i said and yet you won't listen god vindicates his truth and confirms his word with signs wandering and you get colder with time and it gets you just feeling funny you know people getting just colder and more indifferent towards the things of god you know and it's one thing for the world but i don't ever want to see that amongst us i don't want to see us get cold i don't want because the iniquity does abound in the land the love of many begins to wax cold i don't want to ever see that i don't want this to become tradition i don't want us to say well i'm looking for something else to really get me juiced up and so i can really no i want the people i want the people moved by revelation and the love of god that they recognize so clearly you know as the words opening up we're beginning to recognize it's it's not just to enlighten you it's not just to enlighten you though it does the word being broken it starts to show you who you are and you start to be able to identify with all those bible characters brother branham says you can say hey i was back there with abraham you know i had to separate from my family i had to separate from those that i love so that i could walk with him you start taking all the way down through that journey you start to realize well what portion of the bible am i not fulfilling it's the whole mystery of god that's why you can take christ in you is the hope of glory and bring it back into christ as the mystery of god revealed and say i'm going to use the whole bible and then you can go back and say what what character am i not identified with i'm identified in all of it every bit of it i'm identified with it and it does something to you and it changes you and revelation changes you it changes the way you think it changes the way you act it changes your response in the situation that you find yourself in what temptation what trial can come your way after you know who you are and you know what god has done for you and you know the sovereign grace of god saw you came your way rescued you how does that not cause you to act different in the midst of a trial it changes you it just does something it's no longer him that will it for him that run it it's no longer how long how well can i line it up it's not something else takes over from there brother brown said the holy ghost in you isn't something you do but it's a life that he lives through you doesn't come it's not a sensation it's not something i'm producing something takes place something moves and i remember you know i've walked with you here for a while and i'm sorry i'm gonna go memory lane for a moment but it helps to build my context and i i got to think you know it was ten years ago right i wandered back here and brother bob you remember you're the first person i talked to right and before we got baptized and and i i said now i sat back in there i said wow there's something interesting about here i just knew god had led me here you know and and god did some major things i'd come in contact with brother branham and that oh hi brother harry i just saw you back there god bless you brother sorry that makes me hello i don't think you can see that's okay but you know i got to thinking about that i says lord you brought me here you set me here amongst these people sovereignly i wasn't even looking for you but i saw something real and some tapes one day though nobody i could never come in contact with anybody that told me this was the truth but there was some deep down on that inside that could say that ain't nothing but the truth who put that there why is that there something did that i love my mom but she never knew that she didn't tell me this is the truth walk you in it i would have loved it i think she would have too if we would have known these things at a younger age it would have spared us a lot of heartache and trouble but that wasn't the plan of god for my life right but he did something there and he brought me amongst the people and then as i was sitting there you know uh it's always embarrassing to say but i i was i drank myself to sleep every night always kind of nervous you know nervous nature they can't calm down and for me it's embarrassing but it's just truth i was thirsting for something alcohol can never satisfy and when i finally got my thirst satisfied had no need for alcohol see we try to fill it with so many things job work some other sensation some other earthly sensation to satisfy telling you you're running an empty road it's a dead end road you'll never get there you're still running it's a treadmill it never comes unplugged from the wall you're you're gonna run and run and run but when i hit something real that thirst versus anything other than him it just faded away had a whole box of cigars said don't need these no more threw them away had a whole separate refrigerator for beer i told you i ain't here to exalt myself i'd rather abase myself for your sake right i had no more need for any of it it just disappeared all gone went out in my driveway just started i was pouring for a while guys i'd be honest with you i just sitting there pouring it all out i had no need for it i found what i was looking for all these years i found what i was looking for i finally found it i'd been looking for it i remember going outside as a kid you know 10 12 years old i'd go out there and look at those stars and i knew something was calling out to me i can't make that up and before god he knows i'm telling the truth i would never tell i wouldn't i wouldn't just say that i'd go out there in those stars and i'd say i know you're out there i just don't know where i know he's out there i just don't know where that deep calling deep calling to the d i remember going into a bar and i couldn't have fun ever been there out in the world you're trying to run from the presence of god and you can't even enjoy it no more you're just running running running and he talked to me in the bar he did yeah before god he did he came in i said what are you doing here i was like oh lord i just wanna leave me alone i remember saying that leave me alone he wouldn't leave me alone i'm so glad he didn't he drove me out of there and he drove me out of there and i pulled into my driveway and there i saw an old cd of brother branham that i had couldn't understand it put it all away for five years i put it all away wouldn't even listen to a sermon stop going to church wouldn't talk about god because i couldn't understand it couldn't figure it out couldn't find my place couldn't understand any of it then i saw that and i think i remember telling you i took that cd and i threw it as hard as i could because it made me angry and then never i knew i grieved i mean something hit me it sobered me up instantly i'll tell you that and i knew something was different but i found something real and i had found something real though i was trying to run from and i found something real and i remember saying right there in my pickup truck i said lord um i've been trying to find you and i can't find you what is going on what do i do i said that little prayer and then things started changing life started changing for me friendship started changing for me i started finding myself associating with different people and they wanted to have bible studies and those same people they wanted to have bible say i said well i got nothing to say i've been reading my bible but you know i'll go listen to one of them cds again brother branham now i'll take it maybe share it with them maybe it'll help them maybe they'll understand because i don't understand it you know and boom something happens you know i don't think those things are accident i don't think those things just happen i don't think that as we start going in there and if something stirs up inside of me that i i start to go and i i go over to uh um a computer you know and i google search because i said i got to get baptized and i water water baptist name lord jesus christ and the global answer pops up at brother lonnie and i listened to it and i said whoa looky here there's people in lima ohio i think believe this truth i don't think that's an accident i think that was the love of god calling out and it just led me here i called my grandpa i said i'm i'm a little bit nervous what kind of people these are you go with me and i sit back there in the back and i i sit you know when i see the reverence of the sanctuary it's the first thing that struck me first thing that struck me was the quietness in the sanctuary people that recognized they were they weren't just plain church they're coming before the almighty god and i know we could point and say there's lots of things but i'll tell you god still led me here yeah he sure did and then the second thing i saw was a little girl walking down the aisle long hair and a little dress it was just melting me i'm a man i had a refrigerator full of beer living a sinful light and i'm falling to pieces in the presence of something real i'm i'm busting up and then i had brother doyle in the back there gives me a hug says god bless you and i've been around church my whole life i've been around pentecostal churches and big churches and i always say god bless you you know i'm blessed of god highly favored they go on for about two minutes you know tell you everything they are you know they would you've been there you've seen individuals just a religious spirit it ain't genuine there's nothing real about that and i knew there was nothing real about that's why i didn't like it i just say hi you know i don't like that i never liked that but then brother duo god bless you gives me a hug and i'm not a hugger i wasn't a hugger you know but i knew that was real and that something real just got me and it wasn't i wasn't i it wasn't that i was putting it all together now listen i told you i listened brother i didn't have a clue where he stole mom daniel 70 weeks future home of heaven i got no clue but something's real in there then i come and i see something real in the people and that something real starts doing something to me and then my wife you know we never raced with we didn't know what dress was we my wife didn't uh own a dress maybe she owned a dress for for some occasion but we never wore dresses we the god of this evil eyege had blinded us totally blinded us to what modesty was we didn't know what it was we had no clue what it was go to church here and then carrie calls me a few days after we're baptized and she says you know honey um you really believe that's true i said yeah i do she says you really believe like a girl should dress in mona sparrow i said yeah i do i see that i know that's the truth and my wife you know what she says to me she says i just don't know if i see that and you know i tell you this the first time i remember when it hit me because i was in the truck i knew something came over me you know i could have taken one path i could say hey you're my wife i'm gonna tell you right now you're gonna be married to me you're going to line up and do what i say because you're not going to disrespect me and make me look bad didn't say that it's the first time i could promise you before god something came in that car took me over i said i love you no matter what i love you no matter what it says you go as you feel led of the lord i love you i can't compromise i still believe that's truth and you know what happened i think i've told you the story she began to pray about it she put all of her clothes pants and garbage bags and then i was a good husband i took the trash out one day not knowing that that was her clothes but god just spoke to her and it was from that moment she says see god won't let me turn back he loves me too much he won't let me turn back and i think it was a week later she caught that revelation for herself right but what would have happened if i would have taken a different nature do you think that that portion of the word could have been unlocked for my wife because only the lamb can take the book only the lamb can loose the seals only the lamb can make the book live it's the only way and i and i started to see i said so what what is this i'd never seen anything like it what was it that could make a man that drank himself to sleep every night have no more thirst for it the next day what was it that a a a a a a a good girl my wife's a was always a good girl but she was never raised with that truth in a day turn back and never look from it again never no desire for makeup no more desire to cut hair no more desire for those things what does that divine love the divine love of god to me conquered me and that as it conquered me i started taking dominion of everything around me but not by force not with the wolf nature and by love a lamb started taking the book and loosing the seals making the book live you know it's one thing to say the bride over there she's going to do a great mighty work that's wonderful and i believe that but it's totally different when it says this bride right here this bride right here is going to take the book and lose the seals it's one thing to say john takes the book it's another thing to say brother brian take the book sister virginia take the book right it's so much different everything changes when it becomes personal everything does and this is what all hell is against let them feel comfortable and feel a part of the group then we're not threatened the devil thinks that but you know when he becomes threatened when you actually go and take the book when you as an individual say you know what this entire thing was for me i don't know if it was for everybody else but i do know this that message is for me i know that that life was for me that's my redemptive rights i have rights and those are my rights and i'm here to take back my rights i do not believe that this body has to rule me it might have in years gone past it might have but not no more no the person of the word is here to enforce redemption's rights and i want him to first enforce it on this earth right here this is the ground that i want enforced right here i don't believe this is something we talk about with a hope so i think this was used to be a prophecy i don't think it's prophecy anymore i think it's history for the bride of jesus christ i don't believe that we have to be dictated and ran by our human emotions and feelings and none of it any longer i don't believe that i've seen too much of the word being revealed i just can't i can't look at anything that way anymore i saw an open door and i'm leaving i saw an open door in heaven i was walking where in lay the sea i was bound to this thing but i saw a spirit i saw i was a spiritual king a spiritual king has dominion i saw i'm a spiritual priest i have the ability to intercede i'm a king and priest already with god and the judge is my attorney he's the lion and the lamb and the judge has become my attorney to enforce my redemptions rights something's totally different maybe we should look at notes so so there was there was a little so we'll just take this angle for a minute there's a little uh a mighty warrior on my front porch right now kids will know what i'm talking about and the front porch of my house has been taken over it's been been taken under the domain of a fierce animal about that size a little birdie about three inch little bird and every time we go out there it will run you off the porch i have three cats and they're scared of that thing and it's that big like i could just pop it it's a little bird and it has completely taken over our front porch nobody goes out there my wife i like sitting on our front porch and i won't go out there right now i'm afraid of that thing but you know why that bird's so crazy there's a little nest of little babies there on my porch a little nest inside that little nest i saw little beaks and little heads back there that little thing it's like a pterodactyl on our front porch it's become fierce bold as a lion i mean it will not let anything get on that front porch because of love love loves doing something that i'm not even messing with the bird my cats aren't messing with the bird and it's love for those little baby birds now we're now that's a that's an animal that's a that's a mammal and it's causing that bird to do things i never thought a little tiny birdie would do i could see it maybe from a crow or something like that this had like a little finch run you off the front porch but it's that love that it has that's causing it to do things that it never even probably thought it could do it's conquering because it was conquered it was conquered by the love of those little babies in that nest because it was conquered by that love now it's conquering anything that should threaten it or that's babies and brother branham says this and god projecting his love he said love is a powerful force it'll run a woman a mother right into the flames of fire after her baby if she knows she is even plunging herself to death there's nothing more strong than love love will make you trust you might go and know that you're you belong to the greatest church in all the provinces of canada canada you might know that you're a charter member of even the greatest church in the nation and then you would go out and do things that you would not do if you belong to a little mission somewhere on a corner and had the love of god in your heart love has no fear love casts out fear and i noticed in my meeting so much that when i come into the people one of the great things i find among them is fear and what makes fear is a lack of confidence if you lack confidence it will make you fear but if if you love it'll cast away fear and that's the way that god wants his church not so many in sense of a charter member but he wants members that are loyal and loves him and believes him and has confidence in him and that's exactly what creates that confidence in that little birdie was love it wasn't looking at the strength of its beak it's barely got one it was looking at something that actually makes that thing almost invincible to cats and humans now if that's the love of a little birdie what about the love of god that's been manifested in the people makes you bold as lions when the kids had wrote a question i'd ask them write some questions i'd like to get a feel for where where the youth are one of the questions and i thought it was a tremendous question i think any of us could probably or have asked this question what can i do to overcome temptation that's a good question yeah right what can i do to overcome it you know what you do you love the lord you love the lord with all your heart your soul and your mind and you really do you watch it'll conquer every trial every temptation every difficulty that comes your way i've seen it happen i know it's happened you let a little issue come in your home between husband and wife you get real humble real quiet and you take dominion and by divine love start to project that watch what happens the sovereign grace comes in and solves the problem that you and your great intellect just couldn't figure out just couldn't figure out you know our strength comes in our weakness and our utter dependence upon him to fight every battle that we have for your kids it's the same way can't seem to get my kids you know what you do love them really love them watch what happens i've seen it happen from my home you know it's the truth you know so many times you wear yourself out you wear yourself out and you give up sometimes all because you won't do what he told you to do you really create the atmosphere you love him remember what was the cross take up your cross daily it was when two maze ways met your ways and his ways our ways wear us out complicate the situation and make it worse you take his way one time you really do from your heart you remember what he did for you you remember the great price he paid for you you remember you unworthy individual remember the little girl with the flag she began to wave her flag and she was in the corner crying because she saw the king but the king never saw her you can't say that i can't say that i can't say the king never saw me i can say this i didn't even see the king but the king saw me the king saw me and he sought me out and he made me his talk about the love of god why would the king of kings the lord of lords that mighty conqueror want to come conquer me it was his love love me too much to let me slip through just love me too much and we've seen this and these are things i'm just bringing back to remembrance but brother branham talks about conquering those bulls i don't think those are just little stories i don't think those are things just for the prophet i don't think that was just for him that's the reality of things we're realizing this thing is moving from the prophet to the prophecy and i'm looking at the prophecy that the god of peace shall brew satan under your feet and he conquered the bulls by that love said i'm sorry little fellows i i shouldn't have been in your area and it just stopped a raging bull the hornets you all know these stories an upset wife and upset children fussing and arguing in the house brother braham said to come in and take dominion over it and he did it by divine love you know what he did he picked up a washrag i think it was sorry brothers you gotta do the dishes picked up a wash right just started to help his wife with the problems and it broke the atmosphere it drove that whatever evil spirit it was that was tearing up his wife tearing up his kids causing a problem in the home he just picked up a washrag said lord help me he could sympathize with her he could realize her pain struggle difficult day and it changed the scene remember old lizard eyes bert now you think of this here is the prophet to the age hunting with bert all the time witnessing to him sharing with him the word and that didn't move him that's amazing to me i'll be honest with you but it did sow a seed and it sewed a seed to where the right time when burnt little lizard eyes could see a mama deer come out of the woods because it hurt a little baby deer that was in trouble show her true colors and show something real something a real love expressed in a mother dear he says now you lead me back to that jesus and i just wonder this is just me maybe those seeds have been planted this is me you know brother bran no doubt was praying for bert he loved burke he really did and he sowed those seeds and sowed the seeds maybe he had been praying for for bert lord get a hold of him get a hold of him and god had a plan he was going to show the love of a mother he was going to show bert something real one day and then all those things that brother branham had talked to him about became a living reality when he saw divine love or a love expressed in a deer so that gave me an encouragement when i get to thinking of these things and i think how many words have i spoken that it feels like i've got i see nothing as a result but i have a promise those words won't return to him void it accomplishes his purpose but now maybe maybe the words went forth and so many messages have been preached and there's so many living epistles that's been expressed and god's just waiting for that perfect divine love to really start to manifest and project through you express it through you and maybe that'll be the thing that'll quicken that seed to life i don't know but i've seen it have it its effects before i saw it have an effect on bert old lizard eyes and i'm believing it'll do the same for some people that i've witnessed to and i've sowed a seed with i'm trusting that will brother branham says it conquers every sickness and every disease love he said show love one time have someone all nervous just express a little love to them can drive away an evil spirit maybe haunting them tearing them up i've had that for me god laid me on a heart of a brother i was in a just in just down just sad it came to me starts telling me that scripture you know god heals through love just show a little concern for somebody sometime god will heal them through it and it did struck me so straight because i realized you know god was mindful of me sent someone my path just to say i love you this will tell you i love you and it just broke me out of it just snapped me right back too he didn't come down and just hit me with the word upside the head don't you see who you are no just loved me for a little bit you ever have that you'd be all frustrated a wife could be upset you know my wife be upset she just won't sit and talk to me i talked to her for a little bit it's all gone because i cared for her and i loved her and brother branham said every sickness and disease conquered by divine love just conquered it but the greatest thing of all those things that was conquered was brother branham himself he said i'm my worst enemy he said divine love conquered me and when that divine love could conquer brother branham it was a tremendous victory in the love divine because it showed what brought this one to full harvest maturity is going to bring the rest of them to full harvest maturity the same life see for me everything admit you call me fanatic if you want but i want everything that that was there i'm elijah i'm elijah that's grabbing that mantle and saying hey the god of elijah i sure enjoyed listening to it i sure enjoyed seeing it manifested in my prophet but i'm wanting to see it manifested right here i'm waiting to see the god of elijah and i'm not passively sitting by as a bystander you could call me crazy if you want to but i've seen him do too many things already in my life i've seen him come by my way i've seen him do supernatural things time and time again and i guess it's just created a love and a faith that every promise was for me may not be for others that's individual that's up to you i believe it is but that's up to you but i'll tell you one thing it's for me that whole thing's for me that whole message was for me that divine love expressed it's coming from me this is totally different when you put yourself in the picture i'll read you something i'm gonna drop down here into my notes how many remember the story of brother branham i hope this okay i'm just really relaxed and just doing something different here i had short notice you remember the story of the old fisherman uh old captain of the sea i'm gonna have to paraphrase it here i can't find it in my nose oh here it is he said there was an old captain on the sea one time he's pretty much near lived out his whole life in sin but once he heard of and once once he had heard of a bible and of god and he was laying dying he said is there one person that could talk to me about the bible he said is there a bible anywhere on this ship he'd waited a long time to think about that but god was full of mercy and grace they found a boy there and and they that he had picked up on the ship and he had a bible and he told him he said come in son and he set him down on his bed he said you read me that bible and the young man turned to isaiah 53 5 and it reads like this he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed the little boy turned and said to the captain captain sir he said yes lad he said let me read it to you the way my mama used to read it to me said read on he said but here's the way mama used to read it to me he said go ahead son he said mama used to set me up on her lap and read it he was wounded for willie pruitt he was bruised for willy pruitt's iniquity the chastisement of willy pruitt's peace was upon him and with his stripes willie pruitt was healed the old captain said oh i wish i had a mama that could read it to me like that said maybe my name could be read into it like that the little boy said well just a minute captain let's read your name in it he was wounded for john quartz's salvation he was bruised for john quartz's iniquity and the chastisement of john's corpses peace was upon him and with his stripes john quartz was healed the light flashed over the captain's face and he said close the book son i see it and when you can read your name in there he was wounded for william branham's transgressions he was bruised for william branham's iniquities then the peace comes and the that see it's not just a wholesale affair then it's for me it's an individual and i'm included in it you see with his stripes william branham is healed then it's all different it's all different when it's individual when it becomes personal brother bam says in christ in mystery it's not individual it's one person and all hell's against that teaching all hell's against this truth but it's truth it's to him personally i say unto thee he says not to them but to thee see not one hair of your head will perish you are mine i will raise you up in the last day and give you eternal life and raise him up in the last days there it is you see it's a revelation to the individual not to the group all hell's against it totally different when you read this open book with your name in it we're seeing the bride in so many portions of the scripture but now it's got to become individual we speak of the bride as a group i'm speaking as a bride as an individual as individuals that city before me that i believe are a part of the bride of jesus christ the day as individuals have to take the book they have to be able to read their name in it to make the book live make it a living reality make it a truth manifested it has to be believed has to be taken by faith i want to look at some things here if it's okay everybody's comfortable right so brother branham says this jesus was completely totally man he could cry like a man he could eat like a man he could be tired just like a man he was completely and totally man in his physical being in his spirit he was completely and totally god and he made his flesh in submission to his spirit that was in him you see he was tempted in all manners like we he was a man not an angel he was a man he had desires and temptations just like we do the bible said that he did he was a man not above angels or above temptations hebrews 1 4 said that he was made lower than the angels he was a man completely man that god took a complete man to bring total deliverance and he filled him with his spirit the holy ghost was in him without measure and he was tempted like we were and he was completely god he proved it when he could raise from the dead and stop nature and the roaring seas and the mighty winds when he spoke to the trees and so forth and they had to obey him he was god on the inside and he could have been a man for he was a man but he totally and completely delivered himself as a man into the hands of god for service and he is our example we are the men and women we are christians and he is our example let us completely deliver ourselves into the hands of the holy ghost that we might be the subjects of the kingdom of god see totally man but totally god but he surrendered his natural parts his physical parts even his own thinking his own doings his own cares and did only those things which please the father you see there it is total deliverance from human beings when i read that i put my name in there i know that this is a flesh that makes mistakes i know it and yet i know there's something that's got in there too i know it i know that brother chad is is a man he can make mistakes and i know that there's a god behind that man i'm not afraid of the voice i know there's a god in each and every one of you and there if i but you know what if you spend enough time with me you'd find out he's not perfect i might do something rub you wrong but i think divine love inside of you can look past my mistakes and say but i know god's there too you see we're not what we want to be but we are not what we used to be and that divine love is causing me to look beyond the mistakes of my brothers beyond the mistakes of i hope it's causing you to look beyond the mistakes of me and be able to recognize but yet behind that badger skin that old stinky badger skin there's a god manifesting and i trust that you're just like me you're bringing your human part subjected to his will you're bringing your mind in subjection you're bringing your life into subjection your desires are coming becoming his desires because that's what's happening with me because i realize i have a right to take that that book belongs to me redemptions rights and the life that's in that book is my rights i have a right to it i'll look at a couple things here if it's okay he said i was reading a story one time i don't look at this great king i think if you think about what he's done for you to change you i was reading a story some time ago of a great noble king i forgot his name i was thinking about the story and perhaps it's fiction but it leads us here to a point in a background of what i want to say and this is the mighty god unveiled this king he was such a noble king and a great lover of his subjects till one day before his guard and his royalty he said today you will see me for the last time for many years and his guards and his nobles all said to him oh good king why why do you say that are you going to a foreign country are you becoming an alien he said no i'm staying right here well i said i'm going out amongst my subjects i'm going to become a peasant i'm going to go cut wood with the wood chopper i'm going to go till the ground with the toiler i'm going to go prune the vines with those that prune the vines i'm going to go be one of them in order that i can be better acquainted with them and what they're doing i love them and i want to be acquainted with them personally they know they won't know me yet i'll be acquainted with them in that way the next morning when his delegates and all the people seen him or the ones that were in the palace he took off his crown and he laid it on a seat a throne he took off his robe and he put on peasants clothes and he walked out amongst common people now in this little story we find out then a little about god they said king we love you we we want you to remain here as king but he wanted to become one of them to know them better and that they may know him better really what he was it would display to them what he really was and that's what god did he changed himself he being jehovah god become one of us that he might suffer and taste death that he might know the sting of death and take the penalty of death upon himself he laid aside his crown and his robe and he became one of us he washed feet with the lowly he dwelt in the tents of the poor he slept in the woods and in the streets and those who were underprivileged he became one of them that he might understand them better and that we may understand him better he became one of us he became why would he become one of us why would he want to come and be identified with this old nasty peasant that's an amazing thing you know it's one thing to think he became in the likeness of flesh 2000 years ago but why does he come and work amongst us today he was the firstborn of many brethren and he's veiled where and a mechanic and a steel worker a guy owns a business housewife at home he's walking in those footsteps wants to know you better want you to know him better you see you've got to put yourself in the story that's been the problem we were reading it wrong for too long we were reading it all in regards to the masculine version now we're reading it with its feminist tone recognizing the further portion of the word to be expressed and it's changing us brother bam says and we were sinners you see alienated from god and from the world and we were in a muck of the mud and as i talked to you this morning god came to you or came to us he sought out you you never sought out god no man comes to me except my father draws him he came down into the muck of that that what you were and he sought you out and he brought you out that ought to create a perfect love look what you was and now look what you are what did that somebody that loved you can't you have faith in what he's promised you then real genuine love will create a perfect confidence in his word hope's okay i just want to keep going i like these brother branham says this and this is this is amazing think of this in light of temptation okay now here in louisville not long ago there was a minister talking that was a there was a a young lady she waited a little long in life to be married somewhere up into her 25 30 years old she was a fine staunch christian girl and there was a certain man in louisville he he wasn't he had lived uh he hadn't lived a very good life he had run to dances and out to road houses and so forth but one day he found pardon for his sins and he became a real christian real staunch christian about a year later he fell in love with this young lady and the young lady lady madly fell in love with him and they were married and after they lived together for two years they said they said that this young lady said to her husband one day said dear i suppose that it's kind of hard for you just a new christian said i've been a christian since i was a little girl but said for you a young christian you have to stand all the whiles and temptations that goes after you after you've sinned so long and he said well it does become a great battle she said i want you to remember one thing that if the enemy does come in and upset you somewhere and you fall and you go back into sin don't you stay away from home i want you to come home said you're going to find at your home the same wife that you've married i said i will help you to pray back and pray through and get back to god again said i don't want you to stray i wouldn't want you to stay away i said look i married you upon the basis of what you of not what you were but i married you upon i married you because i love you she said no matter what you do i love you i married you because i love you he says now and the man went to work that day and it was heard repeating that the place where he was working he said now how could a man do anything wrong against something like that when a woman that would love him so much so that no matter what he did was willing to come back and take him again and try it again see it shows now you multiply that by 10 billion and then you'll have some idea of what the love of god is see that when a man falls in love with jesus christ the things of the world when you think of what he has done for you in all the light of the scripture not in the light of an emotion but in the light of facts what it really is then there's something that happens to you then the new birth comes and sin is as dead as midnight when as long as the light that is in you how can that light or how can darkness even shine it just cannot do it man that just makes me love him i love that he had for me i mean it's almost unfathomable right but a woman that could say that no matter what you do you come back you're going to find the same life no matter what you do and i find you multiply that by 10 billion almighty god's love towards me though i would fall though i would i would he would take me back it creates a love and a confidence and you don't want to you just don't want to do those things no more you see how do you overcome temptation and love the lord you recognize the great love he had for you and then it just does something to you it takes all that temptation trials and difficulties and just casts them into the sea you don't want nothing of it turn in your bibles to first corinthians 13. it's familiar but i like to bring back to your remembrance things though i speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity i become a sounding brass and tinkling symbol though i have the gift of prophecy and i understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i can move mountains i have not charity i'm nothing and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffers long and is kind charity envious not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up doth not behave itself unseemly or seeketh her own it is not easily provoked and it thinketh no evil it rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoices than the truth it beareth all things it believeth all things and it hopeth all things and endureth all things charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail where there is tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away with and that which is perfect has come we have today by divine grace a perfect interpretation of the word of god with divine vindication that's not just the information that's the access and ability to live the life that he lived that's a very big statement but it has to be the truth because his word is spirit and it's life and if that which is perfect is come then all the potentials of what he was i am that's a big statement but what he was i am and what i am he was we couldn't say this 50 years ago we can say it today but you can have that word but if it's not mixed with faith guess what it doesn't do anything it doesn't do anything it's got to be believed god had to believe his own word for this whole world to be created so does the sons of gods have to believe the word for you to take control and take dominion over the world that you're supposed to that's your earth right now has to be the same way because you're his sons and his daughters created in his own image and god's the same yesterday today and forever he's not going to come up with a new way it's going to be the same way brother bam says let me tell you a little secret here the very most powerful force in all the world isn't speaking with tongues it is an interpreting of tongues it isn't even to be honored as a minister or to be an evangelist or a prophet the most powerful weapon that i've ever found in my life is love ophelia love which the greek word comes is like friendship like you have for your wife there's a difference it'll make a mother for a baby run through a blazing fire even if her life it makes her life nothing that's filial what will agapo do we must love divinely love one another then you don't see your brother's mistakes if he does make a mistake you'll look right over the top of it and love him anyhow that strikes home a divine love projecting you you want to know if there's a divine love projecting in you let your brother do something that's absolutely wrong and give you a right to throw him off to the side and forget about him and just say hey i want nothing to do with him divine love inside of you will say i can see past that divine love in you if there is a divine love in you you can be able to look past that mistake of your husband of your wife of your children you can look past those things and just keep expressing divine love and you know what happens when you express divine love in the face of things that aren't right sovereign grace steps in and produces for you the very thing that love desires that's exactly what he said it'll take over from there i love the fact that he wants to fight my battles for me but man i wear myself out trying to fight him it's such a it's such a waste of time but we're learning aren't we another man says i believe that actually if i would make a mistake and i would go out with another woman and i would come back and confess it and tell her hey meaty i didn't mean to do that i just got caught in a trap this woman ran up to me and she grabbed me by the arm and started so and so i believe she would be understanding i do believe that she would forgive me but i wouldn't do it for nothing because i love her though she would forgive me i wouldn't do it i wouldn't hurt her for nothing though i know she would forgive me i don't want to hurt her see we always want to take this and put it in the context of god but remember how can you say you love god if you can't love those that are with you every day you know it's easy to put something far off but god's giving you the opportunity to express divine love with everyone seated next to you right to look past his mistakes look past their mistakes and say i love them anyhow i know that god's behind that badger skin veiled and watch what god will do because thou has chosen this narrow way the harder way that has walked in your own choosing that has picked the correct and precise decision and it's my decision because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven will await thee what a glorious decision i was made this in and of itself is that which will give and make to come to pass a tremendous victory in love divine message is a tremendous victory in love divine i think maybe it's a far past the time where we can have a confidence in the information that we've been told and we can put together this is how all men will know you're my disciples you'll have a love one for another you'll have a loved one for another and if you don't have that loved one for another time to find an altar because you don't love god properly something's wrong the iniquity may be abounding and it's causing the love of god to wax cold in you love is elective his love is for his elect his love is to them apart from human merit oh i like that he loved me when i was stooped in sin and not right he still loved me it's apart from human merit for it says that the purpose of god stands in election which is exactly opposite to what works or anything man can do in himself because before the children were born he had already said jacob have i loved esau have i hated herein is set forth the love of god he desired in love a family of his own a family of sons like himself there before him lies all mankind in one lump of clay and out of that same lump he's made some vessels of honor and others to dishonor the choosing is his choosing then those chosen born of a spirit will be trained to conform to his image in their walk as he reproves them with all long suffering and gentleness and mercy chastening them with nail scarred hands i like that the chastening of those nail scarred hands those are the hands that i love so much i don't even know if we'll be able to look up to him i'll be looking at those feet and those hands because i know what he's done for me i know the divine love that projected came and produced a sovereign salvation that he gave to me has nothing to do with me he's still jehovah god jesus christ remains the same yesterday today and forever and don't be afraid just sit still trust god believe him with all your heart be sure of your step then move on with god you pray and you love him love is the most powerful force there is in the entire world there's nothing as great as love power only lies in love it changes everything you know it's just it's doing something it makes you relax makes you calm way down realizing that this hasn't got a thing to do with my abilities at this point i've recognized what he did for me and because he's conquered me now i'm out conquering every obstacle that comes my way with the same way he conquered me not intellect not ability not strength of mind you see except we can become like little children at his feet just say lord i i don't i don't i can't do nothing i love you father you help me and then he goes to battle for me it's an amazing thing turn in your bibles to philippians chapters 2. philippians chapter 2 if there be any cons consolation in christ if there be any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit of any bowels of mercies fulfill you my love that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one accord and of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem the other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus who being the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god and made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion of man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross and that's my choice that i get to make each and every day is to take up my cross take up my ideas take up my desires and my wills the ways that i would want to do things and get things done and say now lord i'm going to lay those down i'm going to put that cross where it needs to be so that your cross can come in place and take control when those two ways meet and i'm gonna take your way for this whole thing you started this work and you're gonna finish this work and it's not gonna be the strength of our our hands or our might or the might of our minds it's gonna be when i yield myself to whatever the way is that god wants to accomplish these things around me and it's going to bring a tremendous victory in love divine musicians will you come you know it's interesting for me because when i know what god wants me to say and that's it i don't i can't go any farther than that it's like i have one portion of the word and once you've delivered it it's like be quiet sit down that's how i feel and maybe that's maybe that's untraditional i don't know maybe that's a little bit odd probably is but that's just how i feel that's what was tearing me up that's what was the burden that something came in the home and i wanted to go a different way because i thought lord they know this but you can know it and not do it yeah you can get so confident in your own human ability in the 50 60 30 years you've lived on life and handled issues and still not be doing his will in any of it because you weren't doing it his way but you say i'm getting results yeah yeah we know what spirit that is that's not his spirit no we just want to be found doing things the way he's wanting us to do them and if it's by divine love remember it's got to be divine love that's it's just got to be this whole thing has to be that this whole thing has to be a victory over you a victory over every situation but it always starts with you and it just isn't going to change the situation because jesus laid down his will to do the will of the father and when he did that then what he what could he do for you and me but he had to play the example he's our example and that example hasn't changed in 2000 years that love is still a sacrificial love to lay yourself down and let him take it from there why don't you just stand brother chad i'm giving you time to continue preaching brother if you want to i want to read this last one watch now perfect love is pure just as pure as love is now when you love somebody you see you take your husband or you take your wife now there's no need of telling anybody that you don't love them because you do love them and you know that you love them now if i ask you how can you prove it to me oh i prove it to them by the way that i live to him if i'm true to a true and an honest wife i'm loyal and honest to my husband and that proves to me that i love my wife or that i love my husband see your life will prove what you are same thing that christianity is see your faith you have confidence in one another it's pure and it's something that is real that you can't show it to somebody else yet you got it and your actions prove it and when you got pure unadulterated faith like your love is to your companion then you prove it by the way that you act you ain't complaining no more you know that it's done you're just walking along no matter what a thing may look like what anybody else will say you know what has happened you know that it's all finished just as you know that you love your husband as well as you know you know you love see the love and faith has got to go together they are kin folks they love and that love will produce the faith when satan tempts us we are to resist him with a perfect faith in a perfect word like jesus did the word of god is perfect we're to have a perfect faith and a perfect word to resist satan and it all works by a perfect love and understanding of what he did for you let's just bow our heads for word of prayer here grace is heavenly father lord we just come before you lord very broken up service lord i am but i i believe with all my heart i said what you wanted me to say and that's that's what i've come to do lord i just pray lord that you would help us lord help me lord i i i feel so ashamed that maybe 10 years of my life walking with you and struggling and ups and downs and difficulties and not having maybe my home or difficulties around me or situations happen or come to a place that i want them to happen i realized maybe so much of it i was just doing with human strength human understanding human ability i i just maybe i had forgotten along the journey that it was divine love that started this whole thing in me it was the grace of god that began to express in my life and started to call and change things that i could just not change overcome temptations that i just could not overcome in myself lord it did something to me when i saw what you did for me lord it changed everything about me and lord we're being changed from glory unto glory father i just pray lord that you'd help us lord every situation i don't know maybe we left the 99 today to go find the one i don't know lord maybe there's a trial temptation in a situation that they just can't seem to get it reconciled it becomes so frustrating lord may we just be able to move out of the side and let let your spirit maybe bring this natural body these natural minds over into that other realm lord where we're spiritual kings and priests and we live by different rules father i pray lord that you'd help the people i pray what i said was pleasing to you and ultimately it was just a help to your people father lord we love you and with everything in me no matter what comes my way i don't know what future holds for me but lord with everything in me i want to be able to express that same love that you had to me towards everybody around me father no matter what anybody would do right or wrong i want to be able to have that steadfast love because i remembered what you did for me help us now lord to be that expressed image of your desire father we love you we commit ourselves to you now in jesus name amen amen brother you got a song that's fine the love of god is greater [Applause] than can ever [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] is how is [Applause] [Music] i yes [Music] hallelujah how many love him with all of your heart how many want to love him more you know as the cow was preaching you just can't help but want to love god more and the greatest way that we can love god more is to love ourselves less the biggest hindrance we think about a relationship in any other kind of relationship we have problems in our family problems with our spouse it's usually because we got in the way because we're loving ourselves more we want to win an argument we want to be right we want to prove our point we want to be heard we want to be acknowledged we want whatever we want to not to have to suffer [Music] the same thing's true with god what's hindering us is self-love that's why we have to take up our cross daily we've got to slay this outer man and say i don't want to love myself i don't want to protect myself i don't want to have to be acknowledged i don't want to have to be pampered i don't want to have to be protected to where there's no more suffering but i want to lay my life down daily and take up my cross and follow him love is pure i want something pure not just a love that i give just to get something back but a love that i give and if you can just give there's always something from god coming back and god loved us so that we could be free to love him what he said so much ties in with so many things i want to share tonight so we just pray that god will bring us all back here tonight at 3 30 for communion some things i want to share vast brother gene petri to share just a short testimony of how the lord delivered him and brought him out when he was so sick in the hospital there and so he'll share that with us and then i've got some things that i want to share talk about communion but very much in the lines of what we've been talking about this morning i could see god has a continuity in his mind for us we come to communion what a greater expression of love can you find that a man lay down his life for his friends then god would come and take on the form of human flesh so that he could die to pay the penalty himself not asking somebody else to do it but he come down and did it himself so that he could express his love to us so that he could redeem us back to himself and when we come to communion how could you not but love him and if you can love him that way how can we not but love one another if he shed that precious blood for me and it causes me to reciprocate with such a love for him he also shed that precious blood from my brother and sister how can i not love them too if he deemed my soul valuable enough to shed his blood he also deemed their soul valuable enough to shed his blood how can i love him and not love them how do we not love one another amen god bless you let's just bow our heads and pray lord jesus we ask god that you would just take us from here with these thoughts that you shared with us on our heart lord god we desperately want to love you more god we find that we're so handicapped in human flesh that we're so limited lord that we just need to break free god we just need to die a greater death to self lord i pray that you'd help us help us lord to surrender all help us lord to give it all up help us lord to just lay our our own thoughts our own ideas our own emotions our own needs lord help us to lay them on the altar and just give all lord that you might be expressed through us that we might express our love to you god help us lord help us to die a greater death god i pray to help us to love one another the way you want us to i pray you help us lord just to be a light into the world the way you would be a light to the world if you were in this body of flesh while we love you truly we love you words can never express our love to you but god you calling by by your love to us you've unlocked potentials with on us that we didn't even know we're there if we can just die and get out of the way and surrender lord we pray that by your spirit you'd bring them to life that you would live your life through these vessels of clay may what's spoken today be personal to us as individuals not a group lord but to me that i want to love you more that i want to express my love to in a greater way that i want to surrender more i want to die lord so that you can live or may it be individual maybe personal may it bring results lord oh how we love you and we ask god that you would just minister to each one as an individual and as we go lord let our hearts be prepared for the communion as we come back let's come back in the right spirit in the right frame of mind with the right expectation may you speak to us again tonight as we move to communion to remember your death and what you've done for us we love you god we ask you would bless us now in jesus christ's name we pray amen tell you the expression of love that brother kyle mentioned to us out of brother branham's message when when bert saw an expression of love and it changed him when brother branham had an expression of love that changed the raging bull or the angry hornets or even the atmosphere in his home love is all perfect love is expressed in the face of trial hardship and danger and that's why god never takes trials away from us and he never takes us he never brings us to a place where we avoid dangerous situations or difficult places are things that require great sacrifices on our part because that's how his love is expressed his love is expressed in our families when we have to make great sacrifices for the ones we love when we have to endure hardship for them when we have to make sacrifices for them that's a projection of love that's how love is expressed that's how god expressed his love for us that's how we express our love for one another and our express our love to the family so don't be afraid of trials don't shy away from hardship or suffering or difficulties it's the very opportunity for the expression of divine love and god will accomplish something in all of that god is doing something now god wants to do something and continue to do something but he'll do it in the face of danger difficulty and trial what he doesn't need is he doesn't need us to buck up or complain or fuss what he needs is a surrendered vessel a little lamb that will just follow the shepherd wherever the shepherd leaves and trust that shepherd and not look to the danger and not look to the wolf but look up to the shepherd and know everything's okay because i'm here with him and i trust him wherever he leads me if it's through the valley of death i trust him to lead me there and that expression of love for that little lamb for the shepherd would be a tremendous expression of love divine that the world will see and they'll take note of that kind of love may god bless you as we sing another song brother ben if you'll sing something you can be dismissed and we'll see you back here at 3 30. uh deacon brothers if you could be here at quarter till three and we could talk about
