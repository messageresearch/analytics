before more than [Music] ever more than ever before Lord I [Music] love more than ever before Lord I need you more than ever before I want to tell you my Lord I love you now more than ever before amen let's just bow our heads in a word of [Music] prayer heavenly father as we bow our hearts before you so grateful for the grace that's been extended to us in this dark hour to have breath in our bodies this morning in that breath committed to giving you the praise and the glory that you are do and when we approach your word this morning we just want to be extra alert and attentive Lord wanting your great Holy Spirit to have preeminence in this service not wanting to be seen or heard of our own selves but just wanting that voice to echo through the corridors of our heart drawing us closer to you and farther away from this world Lord we ask that you would deal with hearts and that you would being the great physician perform heart surgery on each one of us as our song leader has said in the prayer this morning Lord I I know what you placed in my heart and I'm thankful to see your Vindication in so many ways this morning and it gives us uh Assurance gives us peace that passes all understanding knowing Lord that you will do the work this morning we just want to yield to you and ask that you would have your way in this service as each soul is here precious in your eyes help us to be attentive in the beginning middle and end of the service Lord that if we linger might it be your holy holy spirit that would do the lingering and that you would help us to surrender our lives and to yield Lord that's my prayer uh I will certainly be a fool for you this morning Lord I I commit myself into your hands and ask that you would just deal with hearts and Minister your word I commit myself into your hands and we ask these things to be so in Jesus lovely name amen praise the lord it's uh good to be here this morning and uh a privilege to stand before you and trust that uh something will be said to help you on your Christian journey and um I would like to read uh from The Book of Luke the 6th chapter um we could just read um that's uh if we could let's read the 27th verse Luke [Music] 6:27 but I say unto you which hear love your enemies do good to them that hate you which hate you bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you and unto him that smiteth thee on One Cheek offer also the other and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also give to every man that asketh of thee and of him that taketh away thy Goods ask him not again and as ye would that men should do to you do you also to them likewise for if you love them which love you what thank have ye for Sinners also love those that love them and if you do good to them which do good to you what thank have ye for Sinners also do even the same and if you lend to them of whom ye hope to receive what thank have you for Sinners also into Sinners to receive as much again but love ye your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil be ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful judge not and ye shall not be judged condemn not and ye shall not be condemned forgive and ye shall be forgiven how do we know we're forgiven cuz we forgive give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that you meet with all it shall be measured to you again and just uh want to speak to you uh this morning uh by the help of the Lord on the release of forgiveness we just want to ask the Lord to add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated the release of forgiveness and when we looked in Luke um the Bible tells us that uh we're not to judge and if we don't want to be condemned then we shouldn't condemn and that if we want to be forgiven we would have to forgive and so that that tells us that we as Believers need to have a heart of mercy and um I just want to go through a couple statements just to um maybe uh lay a just a principle down brother Brenham says as soon as you are sorry you're already forgiven as I was speaking to a brother yesterday kind of got a little mixed up and said look brother if you said something to hurt your wife's feelings immediately you'd feel sorry for her you're sorry you said it you're already repented in your heart Ah that's beautiful isn't it that's right but you got to go tell her about it you got to go and say honey I'm sorry I said that then you're thoroughly repented and you know I I've been uh thinking about Calvary lately has been a heavy on my mind and uh I um I'm seeing Calvary in a different light and I I believe sometimes we as message Believers we can get so uh revelated that we can lose sight of Calvary and its Simplicity um and we don't want to be so predestinated that we don't need Calvary is that right and um and and and so I I want to look at Calvary in a different way cuz I I'm grateful that God no matter how much you look at something in the scripture God will unfold it and he'll show you in a different angle and it'll put a whole different perspective on it and so I hope uh that you'll uh uh maybe see it a little bit differently it's it's I I had to be honest it's it's it's transformed me in a in a way that um I am so grateful for and I'm you know uh you know you sering the Lord for a few years and and then he just unfolds himself in a in a special way and it just renews everything to you and it and it seems so fresh and new and so that's kind of where I'm at this morning and so you know um so when we think about Calvary you know and we think about you know um dying out to ourselves as Paul said that we was to Die daily and he says that uh if after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus uh what advantage if me if the dead rise not let us eat drink and uh for tomorrow we die and so Paul I uh there was Beast that he had fought with in his age and I believe that there's beasts that we fight with in our age and uh you know we we we can think about uh this day that we live in and uh we can we can um sometimes we get so caught up uh in in uh focusing on our own selves but uh I I want to ask you something when when Jesus tells us and and he tells us that if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me and you know we as Believers know that the scripture plainly tells us that um that uh when Christ died he had forgiven us of every one of our trespasses and so this morning we're not hoping that tomorrow we'll be forgiven no matter how bad you may fall tomorrow there's not a hope so that he's going to forgive you there's got to be a no so that he's going to forgive you because when Christ saved you he for he for he saved you and he forgived you for your past sins your present sins and your future sins because he holds the beginning from the end and he knows all about it is that right we as Believers ought to believe that and so if he tells us that we are to he says that if any man would deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me you know I I I I think that he's trying to uh tell us something in a in a different way that sometimes we we we I say it like this when when you take up your cross what cross are you taking up because if if he died for your past sins your present sins and your future sins what what cross are you supposed to carry and if we're supposed to deny ourselves and take up our cross daily now if if if he carried the cross why would you carry the cross of your sins because if he already carried them why would you try to carry him again yeah right but I but I want you to think he but he is also telling us there's a cross that we have to carry daily so what is that cross that we're called to carry because it's not the cross of our sins so we would have to go back and look at him as a pattern and what I realized when he died on that cross he died an innocent man the man never done anything aess he was the perfect one the sinless one the Spotless one amen Perfection of perfection and so him being the perfect one never doing anything wrong but when he died he died with the sins of the world upon him and so if we're supposed to follow in those same bloody footsteps then what cross do we carry cuz he's he's carried our cross already so what what helped me is I realized the cross that we carry is when we suffer persecution and we've done nothing a miss amen see it's when it's when we've done nothing wrong amen and we're innocent that's the cross he's talking about because we we can say well brother Gabe we die daily and that's true we do have to die to out to ourselves but to me friends is it all just about me is it just about me packing my sins and no stop stop to me what I've seen I have spent so many years carrying my own baggage that I didn't recognize the truth true cross that I'm supposed to carry and it's and it's really when somebody does you wrong that's when the cross is laid before you and and that's really the True Cross that we carry because because we live in lady OA and because things happen to us it's when somebody tries to rob you cuz the Bible tells us suffer yourselves to be robbed that's what defrauded means but in lady OA we've worked too hard you ain't taking nothing from me and the moment we do that we've missed it because remember we're rich and we're increased with goods and we have need of nothing but we miss the opportunity when somebody wants wants to rob you you said brother Gabe I worked hard for this yeah but you're missing the lesson I am missing the lesson he tells you we've read that when they take your cloak don't forget them to take you don't for bid them to take your coat also what it's it's when it he tells us to love our enemies do good to them which hate you and I I want us I want you to ask yourself when's the last time we have done good to somebody that hated us yeah look it's easy for us to do good to those of the household of faith I have no problem doing anything for you because I love you it's not a labor but that's not Christianity even Sinners do that yeah even the hardest of hard has a soft spot for somebody that will do anything for that person so so we can't Merit our our Christianity based upon that but really it's those that curse you and despitefully you know what the word despite it means to insult to treat abusively to revile you but when was the last time when somebody despitefully used you that you prayed for him see CU this is true Christianity and and we can we can have this message friends and we can have it so laid out in our minds and have all of our quote books and we can have everything systematically perfect but many times we spend most of our life trying to make our lives bulletproof so that we don't have to deal with that scripture right there and when we do that we're missing an opportunity to carry the True Cross because the almighty you know when he lived that life that he lived he suffered like no man had suffered but he did it for you and I when he was when when he walked the you know the streets of Nazareth and Galilee the man brother brandham said that of all the emotions that he expressed in life was one and it was that he had wept often and we would think a man that was Perfection of perfection but he wept often no wonder when he was on Earth he was so misunderstood a lot of times like we are misunderstood because we think power and might but what is really power and might the man with the greatest anointing ever you know what when he had the greatest you know what he sat down and taught and precious words proceeded from his mouth there was no shouting there was no running the AIS there was no speaking in tongues but it was precious words proceeded from his mouth and afterwards they wanted to kill him yeah it's right and so so many times we get a a u uh we get a Pentecostal understanding of what power is but really what is power amen you know brother Brenham tells us this he says can you go the Second Mile well I only got time for one cuz it don't fit my schedule brother Gabe can we reschedule that second mile because that's how we live in lady oia right we we got our phone we got the calendar and somebody you know nowadays we we we can't we can't just pop in on somebody and knock on the doorstep cuz they may not have time for us you remember back in the day some of your oldtimers I'm kind of you know remember we just go to the house but now it it's such a way where everybody has got everything so mapped out and laid out that we don't have time to go the Second Mile but brother bham says can you go the Second Mile can you turn the cheek the other side that's the way to test Christianity see how far you can go in love fellowship and Brotherhood that's how you test Christianity it's when we're compelled to go the Second Mile will we pick up that cross it's when we suffer persecution and we go through hard times brother brandom says tell a Dead Man He's a hypocrite and see what happens kick him kick him on the side and say y old hippocrite he'll not say a word and that's right he'll just lay there but that's when we have to fight self-preservation that's right amen that's be because what happens if it gets out on internet land brother Gabe if you stand for the gospel you're always going to be misunderstood but what will the people think about me brother Gabe listen it don't matter right it really doesn't matter what the people think about you what really matters is your heart towards God that's all that matters really but so many times we are worried about our self-image before one another but I have I'm telling you I have found that there's such a liberty in just being who you are because listen I I don't want to get I don't I don't want to miss the Rapture and realize I was sowing I was trying so hard to be something that I wasn't amen I just want to be me right and you you have to come to the place where it's not trying to be like somebody else there's God called you to be you God didn't call you to be your neighbor and you say I admire that's fine look I there's I'm I there's so many here that I admire but I'm I'm not trying to mimic you I want to be a mimic of Jesus Christ and and your nature is different and my nature is different and we're all natured differently but that's the whole point God wants a bouquet bride he doesn't want he he don't it's not a cookie cutter punch everybody out the same he wants us all unique and individuals but you have to embrace your uniqueness and stop trying to be like your neighbor that's right yes sir but just be you amen God called you to be you brother Bram says he'll just lay there if you're wondering what that has anybody figured out what that picture is good thank you if you're in the grave that's what you'd see if you was looking up a man that's dead in Christ you can call him a hypocrite call him anything you want he'll never rise up about it if anything he'll slip off somewhere and pray for you that's right see because a man that has the ability to do that is really a true intercessor that's right he's really found his position on this Earth is to be a mediator when when you look at when you look at Christ when you look at the almighty brother baram says Heaven could not receive him the sin of the world laid upon him the world and the world rejected him as their King there was no place left for him to die he could he couldn't come to heaven for he had the sin of the world on him he was hated and despised and spit on and rejected and and refused of the Earth but he stood Between Heaven and Earth and bridged the way you so so beautifully that that that he was rejected of heaven so much so that when he was standing there he would say my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me but yet in the mid I remember this man you know what kills me you know I love images and I love looking I love looking uh for for Christian pictures and I search so hard I have searched for for decades trying to find a true image of Calvary and I've yet to find it and and it always Grieves me when I look because they'll have a a crown of thorns with a few drops of blood and you know they'll have just a little slit on his side with just a few drops of blood and you know and and when you look at that imagery that is absolutely false amen the Bible says that his bones stared at him the Bible says that his viage was marred more than any man and when that cat of nine Tales struck him that the catanine Tails had chunks of Glass and Metal and just raw grit that when it whenever that that that that that Taskmaster would lash out at him it would wrap around his body and then rip trunks out of him now you get whipped like that and see if you just got a little slit on your side and right but he suffered like that so that we might be healed this morning he was doing it saying father when the Earth was rejecting him he would say he would say my God my God but then he would look and he would say father forgive them and remember he was he was suffocating on that cross to where he would he would he was the way that he was in he would actually with his feet nailed he would have to push up on those Nails in order to grasp a breath and not only just to breathe but he would actually find the words to say father give them and then he have to push up again and his precious feet no you the pain that would run to his body four they oh not what they do and we sit here this morning in the comfort of Lady o air conditioned padded seats nice clothes and that's all fine but don't get led to sleep and forget the cross that we are called to carry because that's the cross we're to carry but too many times we get caught up and dying out I got to die today but remember if we die it's not a dread because after Calvary is a resurrection so don't forget to resurrect don't forget because the Bible says his mercies are new Every Morning amen and so there ought to be a resurrection after that death but we can get C so called up in dying where it's negative negative negative negative and there's no resurrection and we get beat down and beat down and beat down and we miss the Easter amen right because he was interceding to bridge the gap and if he is interceding then what ought we to do he was being a mediator he was being an in between uh somebody that mediates when there's two parties that are in disagreement when when two people cannot get along somebody steps in and they have uh uh that they like brother Chad a pastor stays neutral and and he EDS between the two right we as Believers when we have family or co-workers or whatever and we see a problem somewhere in our life with our family members or uh uh uh friends or whoever it is if we have the spirit of Christ in us that same mediator exists so that we can be the in between that we can stand between them and bring them cuz it's not about division it's about bringing people back into harmony is that right that's that's what ought to be the heart of every believer is to be able to bring brother brandham tells us this he says he says if a man's heart isn't out to save his brother there's something wrong with his heart no matter what condition if a brother hates him what that's right well in this message the moment we don't agree and they well they believe this and I hey stop listen No Matter listen this is that's the time that we are to be an intercessor but you know you know what the the thing of it is is when somebody believes something a little bit different than you you have to have enough confidence in what God has shown you that Hey listen brother if you got more light on it I want it amen and I'm willing to tear down what I had and take truth because I am a seeker of Truth we have to be willing and we have to have enough humility I don't care what it is but to many times we think we got it all figured out because we did this and I did this and I know and buddy I've studied this so many hours and you can't that's right and the moment you do that amen it's to me like like when they when they challenge brother brandom brother BR they said brother Bram said well said when you got brother time brother Bram i' like to straighten you out on you know what did he say he didn't say don't you know I'm look let me show you I'm Malachi 4 yeah he he didn't take him to Revelation 10 I'm the mighty right he didn't take him Luke 17:30 but what did he say he a brother well I got time right now I want to be straightened out see to me that Prophet had s and that was an artificial put on that was true humility when I hear that Prophet I hear character right because he wasn't the mighty Angel he was just the mouthpie that's right he was the vessel that that Mighty angel could Minister through and brother Braham says no matter what condition if his brother hates him if his brother's against him if his brothers tried everything he can to tear him down yet that man heart pulls for his brother and I love this brother R said he can't help it there's something in there that just calls out oh my brother you're wrong but I want you to be saved am amen see Eternal what is the essence of eternal life it's living for others and that means means a sacrificial life you know when we talk about Paul fighting with beast at Ephesus and he he was the lion you know we we we we we automatically think well where the Eagles the Flying Eagle brother tear the beak right but really there's another beast in the midst of those four beasts and it was a lamb that had been slain that's right with seven eyes and seven horns and so at I think there's a time to to have that eagle anointing but I think sometimes we fell to miss that slain lamb that gentle sacrificial intercessory lamb see because we spend so much of our Lives having it all figured out you know us brothers are fixers it's broke I'm going fix it and if I can't me and YouTube can don't worry I'll get YouTube certified and I'm on the job give me three or four videos and I'm ready to go right and I'm going to fix it but too many times we rely on our own ability to fix things you know because we have so much understanding and uh really in essence and I I don't um I hope you understand really we are in a sense um I would say this bride is the elite of the elites she's a 1center as we would say right one in a million and and if we ain't careful we can we can take that in a wrong way and get puffed up about it and think that we are going to straighten everybody out when in reality we're the ones that need straightened out right you know be because we as brethren we are so caught up with fixing and I've I've I've found in my own self that sometimes there's things broke in our lives that we just can't fixed and God has designed it so you know because we have the profit well sometimes we can get so independent well we think church is a byproduct and and because uh there's so many resources to pull upon we can come up with our own uh recipe or formula to fix whatever is in our lives and you know uh if you'll if you'll bear with me um what has brought me to this uh you you'll remember uh pastor preached a couple weeks on ago on the the the freedom through forgiveness do you remember that one remember they draw the little stick figures remember that and uh well if you remember he and if you haven't heard it if you wasn't here please go back and listen to it but when he when he started drawing those figures and when he and he started talking to us he said that he is shared it with several people and counseling and he wanted to share it with us this morning well I I confess to you this morning that wife and I was one of those that he had counseled with and wrote those little sck figures out for us and I learned so much because sometimes there's things that's broken in our home and no matter how much we try to fix them you and your own self cannot fix what's broken and we as husbands have to find the place of humility to be able to say it's broke and I can't fix it and it's so hard hard for us as men to be able to come to that spot and the reason one of the reasons why is because we as message believer have a complex of following a man um and if we would be honest with ourselves we would all all say Amen that it's no doubt predominant amongst our ranks because we follow a prophet the moment we talk about it we say no I'm not following them man and you know what that is that's your insecurity that's my insecurity and because we don't want to fall under that following amand instead we'll try in our own CES to fix everything and I found when you get past that of not worrying about what people think about you I follow a man I follow him as he followed Christ I follow that man right there on the third row into any battle the Lord is leading amen and the rest of you that didn't say Amen you need to repent because look I don't need to repent about following a man because that's the way God designed it yeah amen and you have to have enough confidence that you're not worried about what others think about you I know in whom I have believed amen yeah look I I in my life I have been crushed by ministers so often that when I come to this assembly I was so broken I thought I would never be able to call another man pastor and you may look at me and say why do you call Brother Chad Pastor I call him Pastor because I never thought God would heal the Brokenness in my own heart and I call him pastor to remind myself of the healing virtue of Jesus Christ you may call me unbalanced but I know in whom I believed and so when I had this Brokenness in my home I had to come to my wife and I said babe look there's a problem and I said let's let's go talk to pastor and she said I said listen listen listen I won't say nothing because she knows I would be trying to fix it before brother Chad got a word out and I told her I said listen babe I promise you I won't say nothing let's just go and she said yes and so I I called brother Chad and I talked to him just a little bit I wasn't going to try to you know straighten him out on the phone before he straightened us out on the phone but I wanted to stay neutral cuz if something was broken in me I wanted it to be fixed but you have to realize your Frailty amen and brother it's a hard thing to face but you have to break yourself of that Pride look I don't care what it cost I I I I don't look it could cost me my Ministry I don't care as long as I have happiness and the love of God in my home that's all that matters to me it I care what you think about me but in reality I don't it's a paradox because if if I preach one time and and it would ruin my Ministry but it would help one person it was worth it all Amen to me yes sir you understand what I'm saying so so I told look we we was driving driving to the church and I I told I told wifey I said babe listen I said I may have said it at home too but I said God ascended up on high and he gave gifts unto man amen and he gave some prophets and apostles and pastors and teachers praise God for the perfecting of us amen so when we go and set before brother Chad brother Chad is we are not going to brother Chad we are going to the pastor that's inside of him amen right now let me par let me let me just brother Ben let me give a disclaimer listen this is not ammonition for you to run to the pastor every time you have a problem that's not what I'm saying you know some some people you ever meet some people and it's just like they just suck virtue out of you right that's not listen if you're all that's not what I'm talking about yeah I hope you understand but it's when you have a problem and you can't figure it out you have to have enough humility I'm not preaching to you if you're always running to somebody else for your problems don't use this portion of the service for ammunition to vindicate your shortcomings some you got to rustle it out on the back side of the desert amen right but who I'm bringing this to is you stubborn brothers that's who I want to hit smack dab in the forehead this morning I want to bust you wide open and I want to leave a mark Cuz you need it I needed it that's who I'm talking to this morning I'm talking to you that think you got got it all figured out and you're the man of the home and listen if you have that I'm the man of the house complex shame on you cuz Jesus Christ is the man of the house amen right you are under him yeah and and it's when we can humble ourselves and be able to say God I don't know how to fix what's broken in my home and you know when when when we got there you know brother ch had set set across from us and I just you know I tell you I get I uh I ain't got enough good thing to say about you bro I wish you wasn't here so I could talk about you more uh and uh but you know when he set across from us he didn't go to the bookcase and pull out 12 steps to a better marriage he didn't pull out no Dr doson but you know what he did he sat across from us and he just started talking and that word started Discerning my life and hers and he would do it with such a simple illustration as a stick figure and but it was just that imagery that started to unlock something in both of us and um what what it came to when it was all said and done there was nothing wrong with her or eyes relationship but really what was broken was a 8 10 12 year old little boy what was broken in her was a 10 12 year old girl and sometimes in life we look and we see a superficial problem and we don't realize that it's deeper and sometimes it takes Ministry really it took humility to be able to say I can't fix it the same way some of you Brothers and maybe sisters have to have that same humility and say I can't fix it see because you can worry about and say well yeah but if I confess that and I have to talk to brother Chad what is he I what is he going to think what listen stop stop that right there is pride you have to be willing to lay everything out and say I don't care what it costs me amen I don't care I want deliverance and I want freedom and I'm preaching these things friends because so many times we have this pretense that we try to have this vade and it's not reality look every one of us we come to this world broken you say no no no no brother Gabe my mom and dad's uh we're still together brother Gabe that's you you came from a broken home look my mom and dad was in a we was in the message I listen I don't care how you come to this world you come to this world broken there was only one that came to this world that wasn't broken and his name was Jesus Christ and he was broken for us to heal our broken but the problem of it is is we have to be honest enough with ourselves and look ourselves in the mirror and see our Brokenness and when you see it I promise you chances are you will not like what you see and most the majority and because remember this is a rugged Road of Christianity and you have to be able to be honest enough with yourself in order to look the man in the mirror and say something's broken in me and I don't know how to fix it and then you have to be able to humble yourself to the resources that are there and not worry about what anybody's going to say because because it's the hardest thing to be able to differentiate this Perfection of the message and see in this perfect spotless sinless bride and then we look in the mirror and we see how broken that's right but what makes us a sinless spotless Perfect Bride it's not your Perfection it's the blood of the Lord Jesus he is the one that makes us spotless and perfect in his eyes but there has to be enough humility for us to be able to Humble ourselves cuz when things happen in life now this is uh brother Chad [Laughter] 2.0 cuz things happen problems occur and we have this fragile little heart that we are given and in life trauma occurs I found it even in my own home even with my own children no matter how hard you try to shelter them Satan will find a way in and you have to have enough um honesty in your own self to say I messed up and Satan slipped in and instead of sweeping it underneath the rug like it's so easy for most to do you you have to get your hands dirty amen and but if we don't and we don't deal with that trauma we become linked to that indefinitely now remember you know brother Chad brought this he had already shared this with us a couple weeks prior so I am not trying to fill in the gaps to make his message more revelated uh please please Mis don't misunderstand these things but to me it it it it gave me such a look when when brother Chad shared that with me I I I I ended up preaching it in Dayton and Lorraine and now here because it has given me such a liberty that I I want the world to see those little stick figures amen amen and if that little guy is starting to annoy you I did it on purpose good I hope so and and if he wasn't he is now but I'm doing it to make a point because how long have you packed that unforgiveness in your own heart 10 20 40 50 years whatever that problem is whatever that unforgiveness is whatever that ought is you fill in the blanks but the point of it is you've packed it way too long and today I hope is the day that you let it go because we can be changed cuz remember we are a Triune being of Body Spirit and soul and brother brandham taught that in that Spirit realm there's conscience memory reason imagination and affection he labeled it different things but the whole point of it is it's that Avenue of our memories right our reasoning the way we weigh things and remember you know it's like when somebody does something wrong to you and and and and and you you have a little confrontation something with somebody and they blow up and you're like what whoa whoa and you go I only did this well it wasn't what you did their reasoning is Twisted because of that trauma that happened um years ago see that's in your spirit realm and your imagination takes control and has preeminence and you think what is everybody going to think but you have to say I'm not worried look you know to me if if if you share what's on your heart to me I I really I hope you somebody could look at this and think well B brother Gabe you shouldn't even be preaching well praise the Lord maybe I shouldn't and then and that's fine too let God get a hold of me but I'm not trying to be something I don't I want to I want to be TR look today is the day of the open book right everything's revealed so why would we as ministers try to hide something if we're an open book you say my life's an open book well let it be an open book right be honest to who you are and what you're going through and the struggles because listen your neighbor right beside you may be struggling with something and the moment you open up with honesty they go yeah amen look when when I came here and brother Chad started preaching his mistakes when he was preaching on love remember that love serious yeah brother that gave me such a relief because I I've never heard a preacher that could talk about his make mistakes and problem as openly and say he failed yeah the moment that was I was like I can follow a man like that because I'm not looking for a perfect Pastor cuz I found one and I'm not looking for a perfect Prophet cuz I found one amen it's the almighty that's right he's the perfect Pastor he's the perfect Prophet people look to criticize and it's because they got their own critical spirit on the inside of them and they need Deliverance amen so in this thing of of conscience memory reasoning and Imagination the Bible tells us oh Jerusalem wash thine heart from wickedness that thou mayest be saved how long shall vain thoughts Lodge within thee and I ask you in that spirit in that second ring of your being how long would you let that imagination torment you see because Susan and I after that after that counseling section SE SE session look we had a couple of them probably going to have a few more maybe but but the thing of it is after it was all said and done we realized there wasn't no sin there's no problem between her and I but the problem is that little itty bitty boy and that itty bitty girl because remember Jesus said take up your cross deny yourself and follow me but if you have unforgiveness you can't be forgiven cuz remember it's the cross of innocency right and where does Satan C try to cause the most trauma in our lives it's when we're the most vulnerable that's right yeah right if Satan can break that Little Flower at 5 6 7 8 9 I was talking to my children the other day and and uh we was talking about you know I said listen you know we was just having a little family talking I told him I said listen I I said look if the only thing when you get older you got to cry about is my my childhood was so hard I never got to have a sleepover I told him I said you know what if that's all you got to go to brother Chad over praise the Lord Brother amen cuz my job is to protect them amen and I've heard too many horror stories about sleepovers amen right right and so my job because I know if Satan could break that flower at 78 n 10 years old because I know what was broken in me as a little boy I know the trauma that happened to me pretty cute little boy isn't he yeah but you know when you look at that little boy you may see I don't know why mom took a picture I'm trying to take care of my toes and can't even get a little pedicure and privacy so you may look at that little boy and see a smiling little boy but what you fail to see is the pain behind that smile what you fail to see is the Brokenness and the confusion but I want you to go back and your memory banks when you was a little boy or little girl and when Mom and Dad should have sheltered you instead of a parent protecting you they introduce things into your life that should not have been and the traumas that still haunt you today and you say brother Gabe I don't want to go back there but I I I can promise you this one thing if you don't go back it's never going to get any better if you don't go back to those traumas in your life look you have to you have to go back to that little boy and those traumas that are in your life you say wickedness look Wicked that wickedness it says when it talks about washing thine heart that means to perform the work of a fooler that means like a wash person and that wickedness is not like we're talking about something so much as sinful but that SI that wickedness actually could be mean sadness unhappiness unkind giving pain unhappiness misery things that were disagreeable so you have to wash your heart of all of the bad things that's been lodged within your spirit you say brother Gabe I don't want to if um if if you don't how can you have full Deliverance if you never go back and deal with the trauma that's in your life you say brother Gabe do I got to go rehash I'm not listen when we're talking about forgiveness I'm not talking about you having to go to anybody I'm talking about you setting across the table of yourself because in this little stick figure when that stick figure has that unforgiveness we we can either that's what we do in life we say you hurt me once and you'll never hurt me again but really is that living because you can bottle up but that chain is still there but there's a process that you go through of forgiveness and when cuz remember justice has to be served an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and when Justice when somebody does you wrong somebody has to pay but what we as believers do we forgive when brother chadw that line and said forgiveness breaks that chain and sets you free but what do we remember forgive and you so so what we do is we take that Brokenness and we say I forgive you and I'm going to pay the price put it on my tab m amen see Jesus Remember take up your cross daily and follow me and the cross that he's talking cuz he was the innocent one he did nothing a Miss he did not deserve what happened to him it was my sins and your sins that put him there and listen whatever happened to you you have to come to that place and go I did nothing a Miss many times we'll spend years blaming ourselves it was my fault they'll twist things and you don't get up in your mind and you think it no I had to sit across the table of that little itty bitty boy and I had to say Gabriel Smith it wasn't your fault right you are innocent and when I did that it gave me such Freedom it gave me such Liberty to say it was not my fault and when you do that then you know what then I could I could really understand what Calvary was cuz I could really say yes Lord I don't need them I don't need them to apologize to me that's right cuz I'm forgiving them I I because I am a Christian I am Christlike that's right and I am forgi I'm not cutting him off never to talk to him again but I'm Rel releasing them and what that does it's really empowering because what you say is I am going to pay the price is that not what Stephen said when he was being stoned all he was doing was standing for the gospel and he was being an intercessor and he said Lord lay it not to their charge and and and and Paul Paul was standing there holding the coats but what he was doing was being an intercessor he was mediating he was portraying Christ and when we catch a revelation and we understand when we can go back to when we was a 6 8 10 12 year old little boy or girl and the most horriblest things happened to us and we was broken as broken could be but the whole you say brother Gabe I can't do it we can't that's right in our own selves that's right we cannot listen friend I I I know what pain is and I know what Brokenness is but I also know what freedom and liberty is and there is such a peace that happens when you're able to lay at that cross and say father forgive them they know not what they do you say brother Gabe how's that even possible the way that it's possible is because Christ gives us the ability that you can enter into one another's sufferings and when you enter in remember brother Braham says you got to take that person or that problem shoulder toosh shoulder and then you take them up to the presence of God the problem of it is is is we never leave our prayer closet we have to we have to get to a spot where we can from the sincerity of our heart lay those things out and then cry out to God and then the great Holy Spirit comes in and begins to minister and I'm telling you God will show you the reason why that person did you the way that that's more than just a quote friends it's reality in my life I've seen the the God show me the reason why my family is the way that they are that is more than a quote it's not just something brother brandom can do and he did it's something that could be done today in 2025 but you have to get down to business and be with with deadly sincerity meaning business I want to be real amen I don't want to be a victim anymore amen too many times we want to be a victim and we enjoy being a victim instead of being overcomer amen I I I've seen people you know you ever see some people in your home your family not my home family when you're sick they got to be sick they anything's wrong they got to have a they want to be a victim I don't want to be a victim I want to be a conqueror and we have the purpose in our heart I am not going to let lady OA defeat me I will not be chewed up and spit out I am victorious and so you have to get in that closet will it happen there the first time maybe not may take a time or two it depends upon how deep that wound really is right but if you'll be faithful God will be much more faithful so you take that broken heart and you forgive the problem of it is is we won't forgive till that person changes right but forgiveness is not based upon what that person does Amen you say brother Gabe but they was a preach I don't stop stop don't put conditions on your forgiveness yeah right it don't matter what they did it's not between the Lord you and them you you cut them off it's over with and now you are left holding the back broken heart in all that's right but now with that you're starting to understand what Calvary was all about amen you say brother Gabe that's that's that's not easy no that's why most people never go there right but I believe you're called Amen to a higher calling amen you're called to rise above all the darkness of Lady Osa amen amen you are called to be a mighty conqueror that's right you're not called to be a victim you're called to be the Spotless chosen amen bride of Jesus Christ but in order to come to that true position we have to deal with all of the Brokenness in our house and in our own individual lives and it's not easy is it going to be a one anddone situation probably not is it going to be something that just you know snap of a finger no a lot of times you know a lot of time you remember the you remember the the Good Samaritan and the man that that was uh uh beaten and left half dead remember who who was the first person to come by it's the priest the ministry and what did the ministry do I want no part of that and then what was the next person that come by it's the levite just like we do want no part of that leave that to somebody else and so what could have been handled now it's multifaceted because instead of addressing that problem at the root when it first happened now there's time and distance and all these variables become to get intertwined upon it and now it becomes so complex but there was a Samaritan that said I'll get my hands dirty I'll help them and the only thing he could do with that wound is pulling the oil and the wine that's right and that's really all that's I hope that's what I'm doing this morning is just pouring in the oil and the wine right and then all I can do is take you where you're here right now the end brother B said that's the church right all I can do is put you on the Beast which is that lamb that had been slain with seven eyes and seven horns that's the power that I can take you to and say look it worked for me I know it can work for you and then he says give him two pant brother brother said I think he said spirit and truth right that's all we can really do but what we have to come to a spot is sometimes it's not anybody that's done you wrong cuz really in reality the hardest person to forgive is yourself you know some some of us would make very good Catholics right all kind of beas and Cat N Tails and right all well we wouldn't we wouldn't say we're Catholics but uh how many times do we in in our own on the inside constantly beating ourselves up and friends you got to let it go cuz the thing of it is if you don't not only is it going to hinder you but it's it's going to hinder your home yeah amen and if you never deal with that then guess what your pro your family's going to have to deal with that problem cuz no matter how hard you try it you're going to pass it on to them we we have to be we have to be mindful of of the the baggage that we carry and a lot of times you know in this thing called life we can we can be so um burdened down with whatever is hindering us that we can't see before our face and when everybody's happy we're miserable right there's never no joy the GL glass is always half empty and we can have such a pessimistic attitude that we miss our opportunity for Joy when when brother brandham talks about Johnny Crow you remember Johnny Crow right brother benam brother benam talked about there was a a a cruel man that captured a crow one day and tied a rope around his leg and tied into a post poor old Johnny he can only go so far God sent a prophet I can only go this right here this is what we believe right God sent a prophet denomination look if we're still tied we're still tied but there was a kind man that saw that Crow and he set that Crow free but Johnny Crow had been tied so long that once he was free he could only go as far as that string would allow him but really where was he captive he was captive Amen in the prison of his own mind Johnny had been chained so long that that's all he could see well this is the far as I've ever got this is for everybody that's not for me that's for everybody else and this is right you say brother Gabe you you you you you know I understand what you've been through but my situation is different oh really can you really be honest with yourself and say your situation is different you say brother Gabe my wound is deeper than your wound and that may be so and I would never ever try to discredit the pain that you're [Music] under but are you telling me that your pain is greater than the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ are you telling me that your wound your problem whatever it is your trauma are you telling me that it that right there in itself is greater than the almighty you know sometimes sometimes in life you know we we I love I love the discernments brother brandham he is he I love the Lord Jesus so much because a lot of times we look at people and we go well why in the world are they struggling you may look and say well brother Gabe just you know yeah you ever look at somebody and go just get over it anybody well let let me let me share this with you and and I'm going to try to wrap it up is this okay so uh just just a portion of it brother brandom in 1950 he he's uh he's in discernment and as brother brandom is Discerning this boy uh this young I'm sorry this man he he starts telling him that he said that he had a few troubles and you can read the whole thing but this is just a portion he said inward troubles and uh he talks about some things that he was trying to overcome and overcome and then he had a nervous condition and uh but I but I want you to look at what he what he starts tapping into because when the angel of the Lord starts Discerning this man's heart he tells him he says when you was a child a little boy with knee pants on you got problems or something he says I believe it's a dog that chased you or something isn't that right a big dog and you run to a porch is that right I see it as a little boy is that the truth all right who who would know that but God alone isn't that but right now so you got to think the Almighty can you imagine you stand before the almighty and out of all your problems of life he tells you there was a dog chasing you now we would look at that and go it's just a dog get over it toughen up come on yeah oh yeah yes right but let me ask you did the angel of the Lord tell him to toughen up no see a lot of times we like to judge people according to our grit right right we say he's supposed to be a man but see we're all built different right right and and what may be easy for you to overcome may not be easy for me to overcome and sometimes we have to step back and stop with that judgmental attitude and realize every one of us is made up different and some of us have strengths and weaknesses I know some of you just got all strengths right right you pray for us weak ones that's right right but when I hear that Prophet say these things it gives me Insight that when I see my brother or my sister my wife I I know I know the reason why I say one of the reasons the Lord didn't give me no boys he give me three little angels am but the re I believe the reason why is because he knew how he knew my makeup cuz if I had a boy you know I might be a little too hard on him so God gave me three little angels to Tender me up see and and so what God gives you he places these things in your life so that so that you will tender up and then God points things out like these so that we'll have a different perspective because when I read that I got to go wait a minute everyone needs Grace because what you may think is easy to overcome that's because you're looking through it through your eyes when you stand before the if you stood before the angel Lord he may discern Lear something different but what was the core root of that grown man his nervousness come from him being a little boy right and chased by a dog yeah and you would think what but but what may be little to you was great big to him right and so to me what I love about this message is it gives us Insight so that we ought to have a heart of compassion because what you can overcome that may be easy to me it may be a struggle amen right and so and so if if when when you when you come across people that that that have problems or there's some kinde of you know situation or some kind of problem look I I hope this thing to me it makes me approach it differently sir because not everybody's built like you and so we ought to look at people differently and go let's have some Grace for that person because what they're struggling with is absolutely real to them it may not be real to you but the thing of it is what you don't understand is all of the intricacy of their life that's cuz you can't see you you look at this man and he's nervous and he acts up and you go why is he acting like that but see if you had eyes like that angel did right you would be able to see he's just a scared little boy you know that that that coworker that's always blasting you and always trying to get you worked up cuz you're a Christian you know I hope something like this maybe makes you look at him differently tomorrow morning because he may be tatted up neck tattoos sleeved out with tats and big muscle builder and but you know what what he really is he's a scared little boy that's right that's right he's a scared little boy that had some trauma when he was little and so what he's trying to do he's trying to scare you with his tattoos right you know what those muscles are they hurt me but they'll never hurt me again right that's right you know what that shave is head is with the see you look at him and go you can sit in the seat of the scornful you know the problem of it is you're looking at your perfect home with a perfect mom and dad that was always in the message and never you you were sheltered and mom and dad always Tu you to church and you can you can look at that person all tatted out and sleeved out and big muscles and all dressed in black and you can sit in the seat of a scornful but if you have a heart amen amen you can see them all drugged out do you realize those drugs are the only happiness that they have amen that abuse that they are and they're raging out and you know do you realize it's because they didn't have the Sheltering love and protection that you had that's right right see we no matter how thin you slice it there's two sides to it and we if we would stop cuz remember with what judgment you judge it's going to be judged back to you and you have a greater accountability because what much is given much is required amen and so if anything we ought to have Grace for him because we don't know the pain that that man has been through and if we I when when we when I see people lashing out like that I look at them differently when when when people when people you know the the the problem the problems in in the job those are the ones that I try to crack because I realize all they are is a scared little boy and if I could really set across across him and talk to him and get them to open up I would find a scared little boy that's right and to me this message has given me I believe it's the holy spirit gives us a heart but the thing of it is is we have to enter in to one another's sufferings we have to have a heart of compassion that even though that that that dog chase doesn't seem like a big deal we have to be able to realize that it was a big deal to them you know maybe we could stand together you know you know a lot of times uh when we uh think about um the uh the acceptable day of the Lord and year release and the year Jubilee and and we always think you know when we hear that you know every seven years the when the trumpet sound the the uh the slave could throw down his hoe and go free right and we always look at that person as musicians if they' come and and and as as uh as we look at this we look at that person and see them throw down their hoe and we always look at that person and go oh man yeah that's me but you know if you think about it what about the one that that servant was serving because that man had servants he had people that did the jobs for him amen how many times did that trumpet sound and the person that had to let him go free goes oh can we pray we song that song the Sun is up you know that this song just touched my heart last service they had sung it and it and it just went right with it because we think the Sun is up and I can go free but I want you to look at it differently at the one that has to let them go free that's good because we always look at the slave but the one that had him let go was was an Israelite too right and so it was going to cost him yeah that's right amen that's right yeah and so when it came to costing him as you read in Deuteronomy over and over in the scriptures God would tell him so beautiful I I I don't I I don't want to take time to read it all but but when you would when you would look in Deuteronomy over and over God would tell them beware that there be not a thought in thy Wicked heart saying the seventh year the year of release is at hand and then I be evil against thy poor brother and thou givest him not cuz remember when when you let them go you wasn't just supposed to send them on their own but you were supposed to supply them liberally of all your flocks see we want to go free but there's also a double-edged sword forgive that's right and you shall be forgiven amen amen right so there's a part of this that that that God would tell them over and over because this thing that the Lord thy God shall bless thee they had to have faith and release yeah amen them knowing that God would honor that and then bless them in return and all throughout the scriptures God would tell them open your hand wide amen amen right he would also tell them over and over in Deuteronomy when they would come to that year of release he would remind them in verse 14 of of 8 chapter then thy heart be lifted up and thou forget the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage God would tell that Passover was a remembrance that you come from Egypt and don't you forget where you come from several scriptures in Deuteronomy God would constantly remind them remember that you was a bondman one time you come from the T Masters you had the sin of of of the devil upon your life but God was merciful enough to set you free now you have to have that same forgiveness amen and Liberty cuz remember the release is in your hands yeah right you have to be able to release that's to me I I I I just let's sing it together yeah let's sing it son is up now I can go free these chains that were holding me I can no longer see heard A Long trumpet sound declaring my juile all that I once had again is restored to me the price has been paid my sins washed away now and for the sun is let's you play that Softly [Music] and as we bring the service to a close maybe every head bowed every eye [Music] closed trauma is just a part of life [Music] but if there's something holding you back this morning I pray today would be your day of [Music] release you've been packing it long enough I know what I'm talking about cuz I I pack those same kind of [Music] burdens don't let that baggage hold you any longer look as easy as it is to take a pen and a paper and draw a line breaking that chain that same faith that it takes to be able to draw that line is the same Faith you can use in your heart to go free this [Music] morning you know I I don't I don't think the Lord would put this on my heart to bring it a couple weeks after our pastor did along the same lines just to repeat something but if it's something you've been struggling with since a few weeks ago and you just can't get over it would [Music] you try one more time [Music] look I I know it's not easy but don't give up don't don't say well brother Gabe it's always been this way and it's not going to get it is going to get better don't believe that lie of the Devil look sometimes things it's a process I I've had I've had things in my life that I've struggled with for decades but I didn't give up and I'm encouraging you this morning not to give up but go to the Lord and say God I I still have this heaviness in my [Music] heart look I I'm nobody special and he delivered me so I know he can deliver you preacher no preach has got nothing to do with it but all he's wanting is you to be honest go [Music] [Music] back if there's unforgiveness in your life [Music] look Let It Go come to the place where yes you had some hard knocks you went through these schools of suffering but no matter how thin you slice it sometimes we can look at it in the wrong [Music] angle but I pray this morning that God would change your angle and your Vantage Point that you'd see the opportunities that's laid out before you that you'd see the prize that's before you you say brother gay but don't no your your situation is not different you're making it different let him be Lord of your situation let him be Lord of that problem let him be Lord in your home you got problems with children or can't make that bridge ask for him to mediate ask for him to be the mediator ask for him to intercede stop trying to fix it and realize what may be broken is what needs to be fixed first in you I'd encourage you this morning to humble yourself stop pointing at everybody else and start looking at the man or the sister in the mirror we're all but feeble human beings there's only one great one and he wants to deal with whatever is broken in your life but he has a provided way [Music] precious [Music] Lord uh pray for my brothers and sisters this [Music] morning you certainly are the one that restores [Music] and I'm so thankful for the restoration that I see in my life in the lives of my brothers and [Music] sisters I pray that your great Holy Spirit would not miss an a this [Music] morning Lord that you would help us to open every door in our heart even the ones that we've had padlock for [Music] years that one that's way at the end of the hall help us Lord to walk with you down that lonely Corridor God I pray that you'd help us to grab the key cuz you won't force your way in you're a gentleman but I pray that he' give us Grace Grace and Faith that we'd be able to unlock those locks on that door and we' open it up and as the tears flow down our [Music] cheeks I pray that you would be there to wipe our [Music] eyes and Minister as only you [Music] can Lord uh I don't know how many's broken this morning but I know there's too many here for there not just to be at least one and I pray that wherever that one is they wouldn't be able to feel the oil and wine pouring into that Brokenness and that healing would begin I pray Lord young and old alike [Music] that it would be a [Music] difference and that the change would be great in their [Music] life I pray that a testimony [Music] may never be spoken in the church may just be a personal testimony but I pray that there would be a quietness and a rest and a peace that comes after the trial after the counsel after the unlocking Lord I I know it's possible all things are possible possible to them that believe and we are believers this morning in this Broken Age that we live You promis full restoration and we by your grace are recipients help us Lord to believe that and to continue Lord walking with you day by day hour by hour minute by minute longing for that morning between 6 and [Music] 9 when [Music] we'll see this world in its condition for it last [Music] time when those Skies open wide one day I pray that each one of us Lord would have this kind of forgiveness that you're requiring if we'd have this kind of freedom and liberty and that we could be the right kind of an intercessor we' take these pains of our lives and see that we can use that pain and see the purpose that it was given so that we might be able to encourage others that suffer those same kind of pains and we'd be able to open up Lord and not be ashamed but see that you're still a delivering God and that you can take those hurts in our [Music] lives you can bring healing you can bring forgiveness God we love you pray for each one this morning we ask these Saints to be so the mighty unfailing name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen can we sing it again the Sun is up now I can go free the chains that were holding I can no long mer heard A Long trumpet sound declaring my all that I want again is to me the price has been paid all my washed away be happy to pray with you now and for [Music] the Sun is up once more now the Sun is up I can go free the chains that were holding me I can no longer see heard A Long trumpet sound declaring my jubile all that I once had again is restor to me price has been paid all my sins washed away now and for the Sun is up amen God bless you all and I appreciate brother Gabe and the gift that God's put in him and his willingness to open up and share I learned I found that God he's a Healer he's a deliverer and he wants us to go free I believe the same way brother Gabe that there's no God's not a waster of our time and he's not one who is just is going to repeat a subject for the sake of repeating it but he brings it differently puts it wraps it into a different package and he fleshes it out in a different way so that we can see what he's trying to tell us and I believe that's what God is doing for us and I personally believe it's because he wants us to go free God brings these things to us because there's a time there's an appointed time for God and in that time for those of us who are here maybe it's not everybody but some at least that God has said it's been long enough that I want to give you a path to freedom but like brother Gabe said it's not he's a gentleman he doesn't Force he's given us a path to Freedom the question is are we willing to go there are we willing to take advantage of the opportunity that's presented to us because I believe God wants an expression out of our lives he wants these vessels of clay to manifest his own life [Music] and sometimes there's something that's hindering that expression because of a wound in the spirit realm that's got us in a certain frame of mind and we're reacting in a certain way and if there's anything in our lives that's hindering the expression of Christ I want it out of my life if it's somehow marring that expression or limiting how much of Christ can be expressed I don't want that to remain there because I want to an empty vessel that he can fill and he can manifest himself through so if God's got to bring some healing to my heart and deliverance for the spirit realm amen I want him to have his way with me and free me so that I can more fully Express his life in me amen thought it was so good today I'm not going to add any more to that I'm just going to just just implore you if God's dealing with your heart give him some time just give him some time give him some time now as you sit in your seat and pray or come to the altar pray standing give him some time when you get home or tomorrow God's dealing in your heart give him some time and let him work a heart surgery it may not as brother Gabe said it may not be instant it may not be a five minute but if you've recognized there's something that God wants to heal give him some time to do the work and I just want to encourage you with that as we part man I just want to pray a prayer of Thanksgiving if we could just bow our heads together and say Lord thank you for your word god you deliver a word intending for it to be received you give it out because there's somebody that will be the receiver the recipient and God we just want to Bow our heads and thank you for giving us a portion of yourself today understanding and Enlightenment and encouragement and healing and God I want to be a recipient of that word I want to be a receiver Lord for you didn't send it in vain and your word will not return to your Void but you send it out and it will accomplish what you sent it for and I'm asking Lord that you would accomplish it in me I bow my head and raise my hands as a recipient I want to grab this word and I want to I want it to be applied in my life Lord I want that freedom and I want to be willing to play the part of Christ I want to do what you did on Calvary I want to let others Go free I want to be willing to pay the price for there's many who robbed from me innocency they took it away from me corrupting and polluting my mind abusing my spirit realm they took away my innocency as a child but God they took away your innocency for you had done nothing wrong they abused you and tortured you so that I could go free they robbed me of a precious innocent mind innocent eyes and innocent heart and innocent body many people here were robbed of their innocency Lord but you were willing to give your innocency for my salvation and God I want to give my innocency for their forgiveness would you forgive them Lord and help me to be willing Lord by your spirit would you come and Empower Us by your own Spirit to model what you did you modeled it for us may we now replicate it and God for we know there's a secret that lays inside of us that you've opened at the end time God you've restored Our innocency God it may have been taken as a child but you've given it back by your blood and you've washed us with this word Lord and you've called us your sinless virt you a spotless bride and you told us we never did it in the first place God no matter what man has taken from us you've restored it already you've given us back iny and you're going to show it because you're going to restore to us a perfect body a perfect theophany Spirit a perfect soul with no damage you've already given it to us Lord help us not to try to hold on to what's temporal but help us to let go of what's temporal so that we can grab a hold of what's permanent and real and eternal God help us to come to the realization of what you've done for us God with that realization Empower us to do for others what you've done for us to forgive to let go to bear the consequences and God then may you heal us Lord take the effects away Lord that there's no longer a hindrance in us but that we might be free to express all that you've ordained for us to express in this life we love you Lord Jesus we thank you God I'm so thankful Lord that you don't just leave us alone and you don't just leave things buried in our lives but you'll come and make us face them Lord because that's your grace to us that's your love for us you won't just sweep over it again but you'll get down and you'll dig down into our heart and you'll say there's an issue here and Lord if you did that for us today I pray that you give us the courage to face it Lord so that we can go free bless your people pray that you bless our brother Gabe Lord that you restore under him what he's given out and bless him Lord man with manifold blessings for him in his home for his honesty and his openness it's transparency God help us help us to model the same Lord help us to be free bless your people Lord bless us all As We Go From Here May these words Lord find a receiver inside of us and not just a receiver but a manifestation May what's preached today come into manifestation in our individual lives I ask it in Jesus Christ's name we love you Lord Jesus we give you Thanksgiving amen men the Sun is up now I can go free the chains that were holding me I
