the conference we need tonight in america as same as here at phoenix and across the world everywhere is a conference of an old-fashioned prayer meeting of a place of where we can get back to the place where brotherly love existed where the spirit of god can come into our hearts and make us so miserable for the things out here that's going on in the world do you know the ceiling angel said put a mark upon those who sigh and cry for the abominations as dead in the city while the investigation judgment's going on to see who is worthy to escape the wrath the angel was to seal only those who

together lord jesus we thank you for the privilege of being here once again for god you've been so very good to us lord and we've come this morning with anticipation lord with an enthusiasm to worship you lord with excitement lord to see what you will speak to us this morning for lord we love to commune with you it's been a pleasure lord to lift our voices and sing your praises god now we wait patiently at your feet lord waiting for you to speak back to us lord that portion we have need of today i pray you would take this vessel under your control lord and that you would speak words of eternal life through these lips of clay and you might do all that you intended to do today and you might have preeminence among all of us but we just pray that you would take your place at the head of the table that you would break the bread of life and feed each one of us lord with the portion we need we love you father and we ask that you would have your way in jesus christ's name amen and god bless you all what we're standing let's take our bibles and turn to second corinthians chapter six uh i wanna welcome any visitors that we have and we have a special visitor we have a brother anatoly who's a pastor from uh uzbekistan who's in the state's visiting family so god bless you brother it's good to have you with us so we're looking forward to a time of fellowship with the brother after service and then pray for brother ilia he is translating into russian for the first time he has to do the interpreting so he's in the booth now so we'll pray for our brother amen everybody jumps in and does their part amen uh just want to say how much i enjoyed the wedding on friday amen it was such a privilege amen to see the picture that god painted of holiness and purity and the whole bible on display in one ceremony is absolutely beautiful and you know it's amazing to see the blessings of god in both of these families that have committed themselves to the lord and committed their way to the lord and look what god has done we've got to watch these two young people grow up in front of us we've got to watch them manage their way through life as they grow and and make their own commitment make their own choices make their own stand for the word and then god unite the two of them it's been a pleasure amen it's just a real treat and a real privilege and we're thankful for the golden and the schwartz family and for what you've done to raise these two young people and now they're becoming the strength of the church because the families become part of the strength of the church so we appreciate that amen god bless you all let's read this scripture now in second corinthians chapter six verse four we'll begin in verse four but in all things of proving ourselves as the ministers of god in much patience and afflictions and necessities in distresses and stripes and imprisonments in tumults in labors and watchings and fastings by pureness by knowledge by long-suffering by kindness by the holy ghost by love unfeign by the word of truth by the power of god by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by honor and dishonor by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live a chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things may may god bless you as you're seated and may god bless the reading of his word we look into this scripture amen i wanted to take and really highlight a few verses out of this passage that we just read and i was meditating on the service and as it came as god began to unfold it to me i was i was thinking of a statement that i heard brother steve golden make a couple times over the last few days and it struck me and god began to work on that in me and brother steve would say i'm sad and happy i'm sad and happy and you think you know that's a paradox how can you have two opposing motions at the same time but i would imagine if you've ever given away a daughter in marriage you've had two opposing motion emotions at the same time sad because there's a transition coming because what you had known as normal what had been comfortable what you have loved and cherished was changing so there's a there's a grief and the change but a happiness and all that you've prayed for and all that you've longed for the prayers that you've prayed for your daughter amen that god would give her a godly husband and that the two would serve god together are coming to pass so at the same time you can be sad and happy amen and so i began to meditate on that and i began to think about our christian life and i i titled this the paradoxical christian life the paradoxical christian life and and and i believe it will become clear as we go through this that you can have two opposing motion emotions two things opposite within you at the same time amen but uh here if we look again at verse 8 he said by honor and dishonor by evil reports and good report as deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things this is the apostle paul he says we have nothing yet we possess all things we're sorrowful yet we rejoice amen paul knew what it was to abound into a base he knew what it was to have sorrow at the same time he has rejoicing he knew what it was to be called a deceiver yet be truthful to be poor but make many rich he had these opposing factors in his ministry and in his life amen and that was the paradox of our christian life brother ben says in the message paradox the lord add his blessing to the reading of his word i want to take a text out of there for about 30 minutes if i could hold to that a paradox just use that one word a paradox and now according to webster a paradox is something that seems incredible but is true therefore a paradox then would be the same as a miracle a paradox is when something that seems like it just couldn't be the knowledge of the human mind it's all together incredible but yet it's proven true now a miracle would be the same thing for a miracle cannot be explained a miracle is something that happens and you cannot explain it and make it a paradox it's incredible but yet it's the truth now people today a lot of modernists believe that the days of miracles are past they don't believe there's such a thing as miracle but yet i believe that the word is full of miracles i believe the paradox is constantly for instance i believe that every born-again member of the body of christ is a paradox in themselves amen there's got to be more than one amen to that every born-again member of the body of christ is a paradox in themselves i believe each one of you methodists and presbyterian and lutheran that never had experienced the baptism of the holy ghost was in some formal church that did not believe in the genuine new birth and has now received the baptism of the holy ghost is a perfect example of a paradox because something happened to you that changed your whole being and anyone could look at that and know what a paradox is a miracle so every born-again christian is a paradox in themselves let's turn together in the bible to john 16 and in john 16 i'd like to read just one verse verse 33 john 16 and 33 jesus now speaking to his disciples he says these things have i spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world here's another paradox in the world you shall have tribulation then he says but be of good cheer how can i be of good cheer when i'm in tribulation that's the paradox of a christian life how can i be happy when i have sorrow how can i have tension and pressure and anxiety and fears and all of these things on the outside but yet i have a solid foundation and unmovable faith on the inside that's the paradox of a christian life this is what we see through the bible let's look at second corinthians again go back to second corinthians chapter four this time in second corinthians 4 i'd like to begin reading in verse 6. for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us so we have this treasure in earthen vessels so that you don't even pay attention to the earth and vessel the earth and vessel can't get any glory for this we have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us because we realize it's not the vessel it's what's in the vessel amen and we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh i love that distressed perplexed but not in despair you know sometimes we get so um we get so i i don't know exactly i say we get so discouraged within ourselves and we get so discouraged at ourselves when we become distressed and we become perplexed but but the christian life was not the one in which you never are distressed and you never are perplexed and you never are cast down and you never are persecuted and it's that's not the christian life the christian life is in the midst of all of that going on there's there's a paradox going on that while you're distressed and while you're uh perplexed you're not in despair there's something holding you on the inside that you can go through everything else that the world goes through but you don't identify with that that's not you the you is now the treasure that's in the earth and vessel so we can be troubled on every side but not distressed we can be perplexed but not in despair you know sometimes we get so discouraged at ourselves because we were troubled and because we were perplexed hey look to the other side you were perplexed but not in despair faith held a man persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed amen let's turn from there to hebrews chapter 11. this is a very very popular portion of scripture i read it many times but it's such an example amen to us we're going to read about the chosen elect predestinated seed of god that god chose in each age and gave a revelation of himself too and we can see that that the chosen of god the way that they had to live in verse 32 it says and what shall i more say for the time shall fail me to tell of gideon and of barack and of samson and of jephthah david also and samuel and the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant and fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection others had trial of cruel mockings and scourging jay moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sown asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and ghost skins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and indents the caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect see these were the elect of god these were the predestinated seed chosen in third generation and they were sawn us under and chased from cave to cave these were the chosen the elect the apple of god's eye amen but the world couldn't recognize it because of the troubles in their life and the distresses and the things that were going on but yet they had a faith inside of them that could believe god in the face of all the obstacles they had something that could take god at his word no matter what was going on amen they were they were perplexed but not in despair so we see that that god's chosen god's election amen is not necessarily a sparing from troubles it's not god being the apple of god's eye being one in whom the world is not worthy the world is not worthy of them the the world that they lived in was not worthy of the ones living there they were they were from heaven amen they were they were attributes of god that were on display part of the family of god and the world was not even worthy of their presence that's how special they were then but but in that specialness they were a paradox because god was watching them god had chosen them god loved them with an undeniable unfailing love yet they were sawn asunder they were thrown in the pits they were persecuted they were tormented some were tortured not giving in what is all of this it's the paradox of god's love it's the paradox of a christian life it's the paradox of the chosen what's amazing is is when these things begin to happen in our lives troubles come and difficulties come the devil comes right in and begins to try to tell the lie that is so far from being biblical he tries to tell you that this is happening because you're not a child of god this is happening because you're out of the will of god this is happening to you for this and this and this reason but all you have to do is just take a brief reading of the bible and in a brief reading of the bible you'll find that if you are if you are uh if you are troubled then you're part of the scripture amen if you're persecuted if you have distresses if you have things going on in your life then you're following the biblical pattern for the ones that god loves of whom this world is not worthy it's not as though god has rolled out the red carpet for all of his children and everything no he's got something he's going to accomplish something in his mind a purpose an objective amen a picture that he's painting a work that he's displaying a minute everybody is to come in their part but we cannot we we we cannot judge our value based off our circumstances we cannot judge our our faith based off our circumstances but on what we believe in the midst of the circumstances not the actions around us but the reactions within us amen let's go back to second corinthians and read another passage of scripture in second corinthians chapter 11. second corinthians chapter 11 and verse 22. are they are they hebrew so am i are they israelites so am i are they the seed of abraham so am i are they ministers of christ i speak as a fool i am more and laborers more abundant and stripes more above measure and prisons more frequent and deaths oft of the jews five times received by forty stripes save one thrice was i beaten with rods once i was stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a night and a day i have been in the deep and journeyings often in perils of water and perils of robbers and perils by my own countrymen and perils by the heathen in perils in the city and perils in the wilderness and perils in the sea do you think he had perils and perils among false brethren in weariness and painfulness and watchings often in hunger and thirst and fastings often in cold and nakedness beside those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches who is weak and i am not weak who is offended and i burn not boy what a picture the apostle paul paints was he chosen of god elected of god was the world not worthy of his presence i say he fits right into that category amen he had come from heaven he was part of the scriptures being unfold prophecies laid in the bible of his ministry in the book of isaiah he was there by a direct call from jesus christ himself greatly beloved of the lord chosen of god amen one of the part of the apple of god's eye but yet he had perils in the sea and perils among countrymen and perils in this and perils in that and perils in that but none of the perils would cause paul to doubt his position in christ none of the perils would move him from his confidence in god and who he was and in his relationship with the lord amen that's part of the test that's part of the overcoming that the day and age that we live in friends it's going to get more difficult there's no way around it i mean we look at our brothers and sisters over in ukraine and the and can you imagine the perils that some of them are going through perils to find food shelter protection for their children safety for their women and children amen perils perils perils perils perils but with all the perils it changes nothing amen and who they are it changes not their position in christ none of that has changed and in times may get more difficult amen but we we've been established upon the word of god god has so thoroughly uh revealed to us who we are where we came from what his plan is what he's accomplishing in our lives and where we're going amen and that is the focus of our lives amen whether we suffer or don't suffer whether we have it easier whether we have it difficult none of that matters what matters is the purpose that god had of me before the foundation of the world and who i am in him amen brother branham says in the message uniting time and sign some people tries to introduce christianity that you're free from worry here no he says no you're not you're free from tension oh no you add tension when you become a christian because you was kind of a slop go happy go lucky whatever it was out there not caring what you did but when you have become a real christian every moment you're wondering am i pleasing my lord if i could hear from him it puts you on tension puts you on guard that's what makes you what you are so brother random here is just busting a myth of christianity and it's a myth of the prosperity type of christianity that somehow when you come to the lord now everything's going to be smooth sailing and brother branham just bust that wide open and that is not the case amen it was much more smooth sailing for the apostle paul before he was converted than after he was converted it was much easier for the disciples amen their life was much easier before they met christ then after they met christ just looking carnally at the natural it brought persecution it brought stonings it it brought public execution so we can see that that idea that concept of the laodicean modernistic uh especially american form of christianity is not the gospel it's not true to the scriptures it doesn't match what we've seen in the bible but what we've seen match in the bible is that god can take one of his children quicken them to life and he can place them in any situation in the world and they'll believe amen he can place them under any distress any peril any persecution any trouble amen and they may feel tension they may feel uh anxiety they may feel pressure amen but there's something inside of them that will hold them through it all that they will hold steady through the word of god and god can through them by the faith that he's planted in them overcome every obstacle in this vessel of clay that's the gospel the gospel is not uh you know i've given my heart to the lord i put it in neutral i'm coasting along tell you know i make it to heaven everything's grand now no you just signed up to be used of god in any way that he purposes to display his attributes when we read through the hebrews chapter 11 the heroes of faith we we get to the part where they overcame the mouths of lions they they conquered armies they did all this and did all that but if we just rewind the tape a little bit and find out what it was like i'm sorry most of you don't know what rewind the tape means skip back the video i don't know how do you say that nowadays if we just go back a little bit you find distress anxiety people who didn't know what to do didn't know the solution didn't know the outcome who were crying out to the lord for deliverance and asking god to protect them and watch over them you find people under pressure you find people confused abraham had the promise believed the promise but got a little bit confused on how it would come to pass when his wife you know brought to him a certain idea and he thought well yeah that will probably work and take hagar you could see he believed he had faith but there was a time of confusion amen there were things he didn't quite know he didn't know how it was going to work out he didn't know how it was going to happen amen but he knew god would keep his word he had faith he believed but he didn't understand but we see him as a hero of faith he staggered not at the promise of god but grew strong what was that that was the inner man maybe not necessarily the outer man who wasn't sure when will you have the baby i don't know how will it happen i don't know but it'll happen let's go to romans chapter seven there's something just specific that i want to deal with for a little bit of time now these are the things that we deal with in our lives that if we if we don't remind ourselves of these things from time to time we begin to get weary with life and a little bit disoriented with what's going on in life we can have the word so conceptual that it no longer becomes practical but this gospel works it is conceptual and practical it works in the big picture but it works in everyday life and so we must be reminded of these things constantly because this is a this is you know this message isn't a theory this message is a life it's to be lived by each member of the body day by day it's to be expressed it's to be lived and how it will be lived in the face of adversity and difficulty and perplexing situations and all of these things what is that going to do it's going to draw out the life that's on the inside so we have to know where we stand and have to know what's going on so that the devil we take away the voice of confusion and the voice of doubt and the voice of questioning we take it away by staying grounded in the word and grounded in the message because this message is not charismatic preaching this message is not prosperity preaching i'm so thankful that that god amen when he brought us a message he sent it in the form of a vessel that could be waved over the people to show amen what maturity looks like so that we could see an example of a bride they make coming to maturity and we could see that example in the highs and in the lows in the questions in the need and in the deliverance not just deliverance deliverance deliverance deliverance amen you come to hebrews the chapter the chapter 11 in the book of hebrews and you see overcoming and deliverance and overcoming and deliverance but thank god he wrote the old testament and put all the details in so you can go back and say hey before deliverance come perplexity before the solution there was the problem before they understood they were confused and then you can realize this is the reality and so the prophet of god would come and he would preach a god who delivers a god who heals he would show the supernatural delivering power of almighty god that he is the same yesterday today and forever amen but he would also tell you what was going on in his life when he didn't have the answers when he was even questioning his own ministry and he didn't know the next step and he would get offended at people and get upset when he would get discouraged and get down i am so thankful that we have this kind of message because if it was just in a charismatic way amen there would be no reality there would be no foundation there wouldn't be nothing solid the message would become another fairy tale like like laodicean pentecostalism that everything is wonderful everything is fine and god's a santa claus waiting to pass out gifts but that's not the scripture amen those supernatural deliverance comes through distressing situations those powerful testimonies come through troublesome times that clarity of revelation comes after confusion about the promise so when we are in confusion about the promise or a perplexing situation or are troubling times amen that is the groundwork that is the basis for deliverance amen that is the prerequisite amen for supernatural deliverance and testimonies the testimony that you're going to share is going to come from this perplexing situation so it's not the time to question your sonship it's not the time to doubt god's promise in your life it's not it's the time to get right down to the the nitty-gritty of life and say he knoweth the way that i take and when i am tried i shall come for lord like gold because i was in his mind before the foundation of the world it's not the vessel but we have this uh excellency in the power is in the vessel that the excellency may be of god and not of man and don't forget he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world not you but he that's in you let's look at romans chapter 7 and i will begin at verse 14. for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin for that which i do i allow not for that i would that do i not but what i hate that do i if i if then i do that which i would not i can send unto the law that it is good now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members brother branham refers to this and and somebody asked him a question about this scripture and and the question is in questions and answers from 1964 they referred to romans 7 chapter 7 verse 14 to 18 and and they they read part of the scripture and then they ask the question after they read that scripture they said this i cannot understand that was the question of brother benham they read romans 14 chapter 7 verse 14 to 18 it says unto the law consent to the law that is good but now it is no more i that doeth but sin that dwelleth in me and then this person says this i cannot understand. and brother braden says well they wrote out the scripture that's paul speaking to the romans now he said let me just kind of polish it up so you can see in me is two persons catch what he's saying in me is two persons right one wants to do wrong the other wants to do wants me to do and every time i start to do right then wrong hinders me how many of you people on the interview this afternoon has run that same thing in this morning brother brown had an interview and apparently he was going over the same example the same understanding to the people in the interview they come to the interview because they had perplexing situations things they needed help with they didn't understand or they had trouble couldn't overcome and apparently he was discussing something like this in the interview and he says how many of you people in the interview this afternoon has run that same thing in this morning same thing i spoke on it this morning temporarily you are an outward man which is controlled by six senses you are an inward man controlled by one sense which is faith and this faith disagrees with all six senses that the sixth sense doesn't agree with faith but one is contrary to the other now as long as the six senses agree with faith wonderful but when the sixth sense is disagree with faith then leave the senses alone now for instance here jesus made a statement a promise the inside man says that's true the outside man reasons that it can't be true to you then ignore the outside men and accept the inside man now that's the same thing that paul speaking of he was sold under the law to carnal sin every one of us is the same that's the reason we have the troubles we do of married four or five times this that and all kinds of sin and adulteries and everything else along in our lives is because of those things we are carnal and that part must perish but then inside we are a spirit man soul inside and that's faith in god's word then we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by faith by accepting what god said now this is what i want you to pay close attention to how can i take a cocklebur and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it the only way it can be is because inside that cocklebur has been transmitted from a cockapoo wheat a cocker bird to a germ called wheat life so he said how can i change the cockroach i can't change it but i can take and the life that's in the inside of that cockleboro plant i can put a wheat germ a wheat life inside of it now listen to what he says then you bury that cockle burn to produce a grain of wheat that's right see because there has been a life of wheat put in the cockleboro and the life of the cocklebur has been taken out but the nature of the cocklebury is still sticky he's talking about the outside of the plant inside's wheat life now but the outside is still sticky i'll read that again and the life of the cocklebury has been taken out but the nature of the cocklebur is still sticky and it will be until this new life has been fully developed out of the ground and raised up again when it comes forth then it's no more cocklebur but wheat but while it's here on earth out of the earth a over it's still sticky but it's got the nature on the inside of it of wheat and as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live oh that explains it but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of christ and all sin is gone from you that's the thing brother branham just explained our mysterious lives when you're born again that that nature of the caulker bird dies and is taken out and the the nature of the life of the wheat is on the inside and now that wheat life is to dominate the outside but the outside is still cockleburn and when we're born again amen the very life of jesus christ amen that that attribute of god is quickened the life it's wheat life on the inside and when it goes down in death when it comes out of the ground it'll come forth amen perfect wheat life amen this will be formed in the perfect wheat life but until then as long as brother bam said as long as you're you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you you're born again so i can be born again on the inside by the new birth by the baptism holy ghost and on the outside i can still be troubled by an old carnal nature about that old sticky cockleburn nature on the outside that's what the prophet of god taught us and that's his explanation of romans chapter 7. so that we would not be deceived by the devil amen so that we would understand god has so made it clear to us that we won't trip over our own feet but when we begin to stumble around in the outer man we say wait a minute that's not who i am that's not me amen that's what this is the package that i came in in this life amen but me is the me down on the inside and me on the inside doesn't like that doesn't want that amen the me on the inside wants only the word of god believes god amen doesn't doubt god doesn't question his word has peace has love has joy has long suffering has all of these things so that you can become a paradox where on the outside you can have sorrow perplexity confusion distress even down but on the inside you can have a solid rock of faith and peace and joy that never passes away so that you become a paradox that this christian life is a paradox where you can have two opposing emotions going on inside of you at the exact same time where you can be weeping but you know everything's all right you can be afraid but you know you're safe if that's not true then who are we amen what are we you can you can i mean when when you get a call or you see an accident and you see one of your children fall off of something or in a terrible kind of accident amen you cannot stop the outside reaction there can be fear there can be perplexity anxiety stress and all of these things but there's something else down on the inside that knows it's going to be okay there's a faith that doesn't go away it's there and if we understand those things then we don't let those things slow us down hinder us stop us from our progress and serving god accomplishing what he called us to accomplish in this day brother banham goes down a little bit further in questions and answers and starts talking about the indian that was converted that he called chief and they asked him how he's doing and somebody told me uh one time he was converted received the holy ghost and he said to him how are you getting along he said pretty good pretty bad he had limited language so he just got down to the nitty-gritty pretty good and pretty bad he said well how do you mean pretty bad and pretty good he said well since me received the holy ghost he said there's been two dogs in me one of them black and one of them white and said they argue all all the time said they growl and fight at one another he said the white dog wants me to do good the black dog wants me to bad he said well chief which one of them wins the fight said that depends on which one chief feeds the most so i think that's a good answer there see there just depends on the warring of the body that's in you it depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature after the things of god that does it oh i love how the prophet of god can take something and boil it down so simple amen in such a simple way that if we just apply this in the simplicity it's given we will have victory upon victory upon victory upon victory in our lives amen because why not because trouble goes away but because we understand what's happening amen not because all of the reactions in our flesh all of a sudden stop amen i i mean i haven't become a super duper christian because i never ever have any anxiety anymore no i become a more mature christian when the anxiety does not identify me and it doesn't scare me anymore brother branham even talked about this nervous condition he said he goes he goes i've been nervous since i was a child and he said he said it used to scare me that right that nervous condition that would come upon him and then then he would get this real weary feeling and and and it would make him sour at his stomach and he had all of this he had to leave the field even before he said it used to scare me but he said it don't scare me no more he said i can just feel that it's there but it don't scare me anymore see we can realize that there's a cockleburn nature that's still there but don't let it scare you anymore you can tell that sometimes stress rises and anxiety will come up in situations but don't let that scare you anymore don't give in to that amen don't pay attention to it because when you pay attention to it anything you focus on expands and if you expand on the stress and expand on the anxiety and expand on the confusion then that thing will expand in your life and begin to overwhelm you but it matters what nature you cater to and you say that's just the outer me god will take care of that when my atoms change i'm not even paying attention to it because there's a promise in the word and i'm focusing my attention on that and listen when we begin to do that those things lose their power to control us anymore he goes on to say in the same questions and answers this is a dying spirit and a dying body but now you can't be in two bodies at one time but there can be two natures in you at one time now listen closely to this next thing that brother brown says all the way back in demonology physical realm from 1953 he says many times you can see a person maybe of insanity now they may be yet a converted person filled with the holy spirit and yet be totally insane catch this that's right that has nothing to do with the soul it's a torment or see something that torments them it's torment in the outer man because the outer man is your mind and your body right and the tormentor can be tormenting your outer man and it has nothing to do with your soul the prophet of god says you know they can be totally insane and yet a converted person filled with the holy spirit now if we're believing in charismatic laodicean american type of christianity then we would never accept that you could have the holy ghost and be tormented of an evil spirit amen in your mind and in the outer man but the prophet of god told us differently amen and so now when we realize that these emotions sometimes that swirl through me that is not my soul my psyche is not my soul listen do you realize how delivering that is friends what delivering power there is in that truth that my psyche is not my soul amen there can be perplexity distress and torment going on in my mind amen and if you if you've never had torment going on in your mind just live a few more years amen it's going to happen you're going to come under a stress and perplexity and torment in your mind amen but don't ever let that become your identity don't ever that's just the caulker burn nature you were born into that comes from the the names associated with your birth certificate but it has nothing to do with your new birth nothing whatsoever to do with your new birth you know the prophet of god just does things with the word that absolutely destroys wrong understanding even brother brahm told us a story he was told a story about a minister one time that had enough and he tore up his preaching papers threw him in the trash and went out and bought a case of beer and the next sunday sat down and drank that beer and then he died and all of us would have been like poor backslidden creature going to hell my my armenian style pentecostalism i grew up in that would have been what would have happened that would have been our idea our concept but brother branham said see god just had to take his child home he couldn't take it anymore it doesn't it doesn't make sense to the carnal mind but brother branham understood things in a whole different level than we understand them now i'm not suggesting you go have at it that was i think a unique situation but brother ben would never make the outside man the identity of the inside man but we believe with all of our heart that the quickening power on the inside will bring this outside man subject to the inside we believe that with all of our heart that the outside man will reflect the life of jesus christ that's the gospel that's the message that's the bible too so this is no past for living any way you want that's not christianity either but we have to understand that when when the outside man sends us the wrong signals that's not who i am and i don't have to accept it as me and i don't have to cater to it i don't have to live that because my psyche is not my soul it is not who i am and when we can get come to terms with that then all of a sudden we can be absolutely free from the torment that comes by thinking this thought is me that this thought is me this is my identification and i'm this and i'm that no you're a born-again child of god if you've received the baptism of the holy ghost and god has quickened that seed of life to life you are a child of god never to be lost never to be removed from his hand and whatever happens in the psyche god can fix that amen but the soul has nothing to do with the outer man the soul is to take dominion over the outer man that's why it matters which nature we cater to we cater to the nature of the soul the inner man after the new birth and it'll begin to bring this outer man's subject it'll be green to change the thought process subject to the word of god it'll take a stressful situation and then all of a sudden the the the life on the inside will begin to bring it subject amen the anxiety bring it subject by what by faith in the word of god by standing on the promise by believing amen i i've been in some stressful situations where i've been perplexed and tormented and just troubled in the emotional realm and i'll play a tape and all of a sudden by the end of the tape that stuff's gone but what if i didn't amen what if i didn't cater to the inside man and i kept sitting and fixating on my trouble and oh why am i thinking this and why am i doing that maybe i'm this and maybe i'm that and all that when all i did is went to the word and in the atmosphere of the word under the voice of the seventh angel all of a sudden the psyche begins to fade away and all of a sudden the reality it's like the it's like the uh um the prodigal son he came to himself all of a sudden under the preaching of the word i realized hey that's nonsense that's not the truth amen this is the truth and all of a sudden that fades away so we cannot let the culkeber nature define us and we cannot cater to it in any way listen to what the prophet of god says he begins to talk to his church he says we're just a bunch of home folks this morning said i'm homesick i want to go home and i don't know where to go you say what about going in arizona your family's there i'm all right for two or three days and i got to go somewhere else and i go there and then i'm all right there two or three days and i got to go somewhere else so there just ain't no home to go to and i'm homesick well there is a home i'll go to that one sometime but i've got to help you first that's what i'm here for is to help you until that time comes till i can't help you no more i want to go home i want to go really home then but there is a place somewhere i'm going to like so well i won't want to come back i'll leave jeffersonville i'll be gone a few weeks i want to come back again i go to arizona i think that's wonderful i want to come back again i go somewhere else and i want to come back again i go here go there and then i think i want to come here i get here i'm just a few just here a few days and i see you all and i want to go somewhere else see i got my children scattered out over the world and them that i've begotten to christ and then i don't have no home i want to get to them all together one of these days father will and then we'll have a home where we won't have to roam around no more i get tired rambling and no place to stay and i'd advise anybody never be a rolling stone unless it's some kind of a ministry that calls you to that because i just give anything this morning if i had a place here on earth that i could go and say this is home if i had it i'd give a million dollars if i had a place that i could say boy i just love this so well i don't want to leave it no more i'd give anything but i can't find it i'm something like abraham was i'm looking for a city i can't find it but i know it's there but i certainly can't get adjusted to any certain place on this earth it just looked like fine people find places and you go there it's too wet go out there it's too dry go up here it's too cold go down there it's too hot and there's no place that just ain't home don't make up my i don't make up my time crying on your shoulder but well we're thankful to the lord amen be thankful for all things i'm thus because i am thus god made me what i am and i can't be nothing but what he made me melancholy and those kind of things they tell me i just have to be that way in order to be the help that he sent me here to be and i want to be that kind of person if that's the way i was supposed to be that's what i want to be whatever the kingdom of god's will or god's will that's what i want to be brother brennan when just a home folks he begins to break down some of his own temperament and the old things he struggles with he can't settle down he can't find a place of rest he's got that rambling spirit and he's nervous and he tells in another place i get nervous and just have to go and he gets gets he gets weary he gets wore down he can't settle down he's got this melancholy and he says god made him that way for for us he made him that way so he'd go from place to place begins begins to break down that that there's things that he struggles with god uses that that nature to serve his purpose but it also created a struggle for the prophet of god the thing that god was using for our benefit and for the benefit of the people in that day amen is also something that becomes problematic for the prophet and something he has to deal with it's the it's the uh perplexity it's the paradox of our christian life that god looked after us and then he looked after our grandparents and our parents amen to get this one amen matched up with this one to get a certain character to get a certain set of traits amen so that each each bell would have a certain ting to it remember the prophet talking about that when they mixed the bell so many alloys so much ten and so much copper amen to make it give us just a certain pitch and he did our lives that way amen where did he do that in the carnal things and the carnal things and what's what's what's in the sticky culkeber nature amen god built it in such a way that he could get an expression out of you and i he could get a certain work a certain thing out of you and i but it's the very thing that god's using for his purpose is the very thing that's causing us trouble amen it's it's perplexing sometimes sometimes you hate the way that you're made has anybody ever hated the way you're made but you can't hate it too much because god intended you to be that way for his purpose how can these two things be uh going on simultaneous in our lives that i hate the way that i am i've never met anybody says i really just admire the way that i am like my personality and that's not somebody i'd stay away from but brother bram said my greatest enemy is william branham i look him in the face in the morning and that's the one i'm fighting with he's the one that's always getting in god's way he's the one getting in god's way but god built him with a certain fashion so god could use him to go his way he made him melancholy but melancholy is what brother branham got spanked for he was corrected from god for being melancholy and building up a complex but god made him that way so god could use him to preach the gospel a certain way so there's a paradox in our lives there's a paradox in our outer man and the paradox is that god saw to it to have you shaped and fashioned a certain way amen so that he could work his plan through your life but the paradox is it's the very same realm in which god ordained to be a certain way for his service is the very thing that keeps tripping you up and causing you all your problems so you hate the way you are but you better be careful on how much you hate it because god chose it that way right sometimes we you know somebody brother bam said sometimes you know people are you know john had a certain nature the apostle john he was always you know gentle and he was sensitive and he was he was close to jesus he was the one laying on his breast he said but peter he was more boisterous and bold and brash which one was better which one served god's purpose better which one would you say you know now paul or you know peter you should act like john now john if it was us we'd be like okay i'll mix a little bit of john and with a little bit of paul and with a little bit of peter and if we get him just right then that that's what i would want to be but god needed peter to be peter and he needed john to be john and he needs you to be you so there's a paradox in you you're a walking paradox between the inner and outer round but there's a paradox in the outer realm i say god help us help us just to surrender and say god have your way i can't figure it out i don't understand it i would have made me this way but you did some people never talk some people never stop talking some people are real outgoing unfriendly some people are real quiet and thoughtful and it takes all of them to fulfill god's purpose the person who's really quiet and bashful deep in thought they wish that they could be more outgoing and open and have all the friends and the person who talks all the time is the one who goes home and says why do i always run my mouth why can't i shut up the person who's always quiet says why couldn't i just said what was on my mind it would have helped them we're a paradox friends but when we understand these things we begin to realize this is god's doing i'm just going to cater to the inner man i'm going to stay by this word and let god sword i can't figure it all out i can't i can no more change me than i can make the moon rise earlier i can i can't do anything i am what i am by the grace of god and by what god wanted i wish i could change it i can't change it i wish i could be more like this and more like that i see people preach and i'm like why can't i preach like that why can't i when i i mean that was so nice but you can't you can only be what you are and you say you know what it's in god's hands i'm not going to worry about it anymore but i know who i am by the grace of god and i know he's called me i know he's working in me and i know anything wrong he'll work out of me i'm not paying attention to the outer man i'm focusing on this word and the inner man and i'll let god sort it all out if not we're always depressed we're always anxious we always hate ourselves we always hey forget about it just serve god and let god take care of those things all of it's going to work for his glory let me find let's read psalms 142. i just want to read a couple more places here but let's go to the book of psalms chapter 142. if you look at david david was a paradox he was anointed to be king of israel he was anointed by a mighty prophet he was the anointed king of israel and under the power of that anointing and the faith that he had he could kill a bear he could kill a lion he could kill goliath when the rest of the army was terrified i mean look at what anointing was in his life the anointed king of israel and the anointed king of israel is running scared for his life from cave to cave decay crying unto the lord weeping writing psalms asking for deliverance and asking for help and he's the anointed king of israel with enough anointing to slay his ten thousands and now he's in trouble amen and he's running from cave to cave for his life and he doesn't understand what's going on he doesn't know what god's doing in his life he doesn't know what the answer is what the solution is he he is perplexed let's look at this in in psalms 142 verse 1 i cried unto the lord with my voice with my voice and to the lord did i make my supplication i poured out my complaint before him i showed before him my trouble when my spirit was overwhelmed within me then thou knewest my path oh i loved that scripture when my spirit was overwhelmed within me then thou knewest my path in the way where and i walked have they privately laid a snare for me i looked on my right hand and behold but there was no man that would know me that would know me refuge failed me no man cared for my soul i cried unto the lord o lord i said thou art my refuge in my portion in the land of the living attendant to my cry for i am brought very low deliver me from my pers persecutors for they are stronger than i bring my soul out of prison that i may praise thy name thy righteous shall compass thy the righteous shall compass me about for thou shalt deal bountifully with me i love the way uh david writes so many psalms so many times david starts off in distress he starts off crying he starts off in distress and if you read through the psalms you'll find this pattern many times in the psalms that he'll he'll start off distressed he'll start off in trouble he'll start off weeping and then he'll make a declaration but god hears me and then he'll continue on with the weeping and the crying and the asking of her help but he'll conclude with god will save me oh friends how many times do we go through that same process in our life we start off with the weeping and the despair but we remember the promise but god you know who i am you called me you saved me you filled me with your spirit and now i'm in trouble and and i don't know what to do and i don't know the decisions to make and i don't know which way to go but i know that you'll carry me through i mean what are you doing you're praying just like david prayed amen we're coming back getting away from all the outside and coming back to the core truth that's laying there it's always been laying there that will never change the truth for david is david was chosen to be the anointed king of israel no matter what the circumstances was that truth remained no matter how much it looked like it wasn't happening and and then his life was in jeopardy his life was never in jeopardy because he was anointed to be king of israel when he was distressed and confused and maybe disappointed even possibly discouraged by the way he writes the psalms it looks like times he's discouraged and disappointed and confused amen but it never changed the underlying truth that he was the chosen amen anointed king of israel and god was going to bring him to that position we've been called anointed to be the bride in this end time no matter how many caves you dodge into to run for cover it won't change that no matter how many tears you shed over the circumstances in your life it will not change that no matter how many times you're confused about what god is doing in your life or how many times you're in distress because of your own nature or your own or whatever is going on around you no matter how much you run from cave to cave and crying to the lord it will not change that you have been anointed to be the bride of jesus christ in this day it will not change your position it will not change who you are and it will not change your destiny or the fact that god will do exactly what he purposed to do in your life can we keep from crying no can you keep the pressure off no can you change all your circumstances no if you could you would have a long time a long time ago you would have if you could remove all perplexity you would have already done it if you would have freed yourself from all stress you would have already done it if you could have solved all your problems if you could have solved all your problems and you didn't then you got a problem there's things that are kind of come that are coming that we can't do anything about there are there are things that will be confusing distressful all of the above but what can we do i'd say i do like david did cry unto the lord said lord you see me you see where i'm hurting you see what i'm struggling with but i know you haven't forgotten me but i know when that prophet looked out and said i'm going to call you bride so that you understand he was speaking to me that's my title that's who i am i've been anointed under the holy ghost that has come back unto the church today the word has washed me established me placed my foot on my feet on firm ground and gone i know that i'll come through this too i know that you'll change this and i know whatever happens that's not changing in your mind i think sometimes we just need to hear ourselves say it i think sometimes amen we we we get in situations and we just mull them over in our minds and and then the devil begins to have a playground in our thinking and we begin to mull them over and mull them over and roll them around and roll them around i'm guilty of doing this i'll do this for months on end but i think sometimes we just need to take it out of our mind and put it in our mouth and say god this is the situation but i know who i am i know who chose me and i know that you're going to fix this situation and i'm declaring my confidence in that today i think that'll bring more peace than mulling it over one more time then letting it go around the merry-go-round of the mind one more loop what is that going to accomplish nothing but we've got to come back to the word and say the word says this and i believe the word the word says i'm healed the word says i'm delivered the word says i'm his the word says i'm in his hand and he'll never lose me brother man goes on to say in a message from 1957 titled god in his word and then i wonder sometimes i get so discouraged who's saying this the prophet of god the one who spoke squirrels into existence the one who started a healing revival that swept the world the one who prayed for multitudes of sick people and saw people with blind eyes open saw people with no eyeballs in their sockets eyes come back into their sockets and deaf ears he saw opened by by by faith in the word of god in his prayer amen stood before uh multitudes of people and cast out demons night after night after night saw ministries rise up all around him that that proclaimed that it was his gift and his moving forward that encouraged them to step forward you know in oral roberts and tommy hicks and tommy osborne and all these healing campaigns this is the one you would think how could you be discouraged but it's the paradox of the christian life the one that was the most used we i mean tell me where in history where anywhere have you ever seen a ministry a man used at the level that god used this vessel show it to me where have you seen it whether it was used amen to this level with this much manifestation and yet he was discouraged i don't feel so guilty for feeling discouraged then i wonder sometimes i get so discouraged it's a wonder my wife can put up with me i go around after the meeting i feel so moody i cry a while i walk around a while and i say oh i'm a total failure i don't see why the lord ever had anything to do with me it's coming out from under that anointing you see that's when you're up there you feel like you could pack the world away and when you're down here it's all right but it's coming between the two that's where it gets you like elijah was up on the mountain why he called fire out of heaven then he called rain out of the heavens after it hadn't rained for three years what anointing called up 400 balaam priests and chopped their heads off what a powerful anointing then went down into the desert and the threat of a woman run him out into the desert and when the anointing left him he was 40 days wandering out there in the wilderness and god found him pulled back in a cave that's right no need to try to explain it you can't you see in the bible elijah on the mountaintop he was invincible friends unstoppable amen had a tremendous victory and then one woman threatened his life and he runs scared into the wilderness let's just look at what he says in first kings i'd like to just read what he says here first kings 19 and 2. and it's not so much what he says that i want to look at but i want to look at god's response 19 and 2 then jezebel sent a messenger into elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to beersheba which belonged to judah and left his servant there but he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die i say he was discouraged depressed possibly he requested that he might die he had just had a tremendous victory that would turn the hearts of god's children back to god he had just had supernatural events take place by obeying the word of god fire from heaven come down and he runs into the wilderness and he asks god to let him die he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now o lord take away my life for i am not better than my father's and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat and he looked and behold there was a cake bacon on the coals and a cruise of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again here comes the paradox of elijah standing on mount carmel the mighty prophet of god invincible with the word of god that cannot be defeated calling a challenge to the false religion and the false priests they take him up on the challenge he knows where he stands he knows who he is god is working in him and showed him what to do nothing can stop him amen and they gives them their chance to to prove that their god is real and he begins to he's so confident in himself he begins to mock them maybe your god is on a uh per adventure he's he's traveling and he's far away and he starts to mock them he's so confident and then when the time comes he he's so sure that god answered by fire he comes and he bathes the sacrifice and the altar in the wood and water and and it comes and flows over till it fills the trenches and and then he he calls out to god and said god i have done this at thy command and fire from heaven comes down and consumes the sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the water and all before the eyes of israel amen he was vindicated he was proved everything was as god would say a mighty miracle that nobody can deny amen then they take the false prophets 400 false prophets of baal and they slay them to free israel from the rain what a victory and the next day he runs for his life he's discouraged and depressed he crimes under he wants to be by himself that's always a sure sign he doesn't want anybody around he leaves a certain he goes off by himself climbs under a juniper tree and says lord i want to die have you ever been under so much stress and i'm distressed that you just wanted to leave this world i have especially after brother brown tells us about the sixth dimension i mean it doesn't take very much to get me to want to go if i have to wait in line at the store i'm like just take me to the sixth dimension it doesn't take very many trials anymore but here elijah take my life what good is it me for me i let me die i'm no better than my father's what does god do god is not disrupted by a psyche because god knows who he is he knows what's in him and god doesn't cast him away because he's having a meltdown god doesn't discard him because he's lost his vision god doesn't cast him away because now he's depressed and he wants to die and he's lost his vision his purpose to serve god he just wants to leave this planet he just wants to be free from all the pressure amen and god doesn't discard him but brother brahma said he sent the angel with the softest hands he didn't kick him god's not afraid of your psyche it doesn't change anything god's put something in you to overcome that psyche and god sent a word in this day to explain everything to us so that we don't have to cater to that we don't have to give in to it we don't have to be afraid of it amen we don't have to pay attention but we can come back to the inner man and stand upon the word and believe god till all of this sorts itself out and god brings it back in line to the word we don't have to fear it we don't have to fight it we don't have we can just ignore it and say god will take care of that i'm focusing on my purpose in this life i'm focusing on what god called me to do but god wasn't afraid of elijah's psyche he wasn't afraid of his discouragement he wasn't afraid so he sends the angel with the softest hands and he baked a meal for him because he was a tired servant he had overworked and he got too tired and god knew and he sent the angel with the softest hands just to stroke his cheek to wake him up not to startle him because he's stressed not to shake him awake because he's he's in a fragile state of mind you think god doesn't understand who we are you think god doesn't understand what we go through send the angels with the softest hands to stroke his cheek awake and when he opened his eyes he saw coals and on the fire bake the bread and he ate and he went back to sleep god knew what he needed was just a little bit of rest not kicked around not told how worthless he was not corrected for how can you say let me die why would you say a thing like that god's the one who determines your life and determines your death god realized he was an overworked tired servant who was a little bit neurotic because he needed to be that way for his purpose in life brother ben said i've been a neurotic all my life but i needed to be that way you think god didn't understand the prophet of god you think god doesn't understand you sent the angel with the softest hands put him back to sleep stroked him one more time and gave him enough energy enough strength enough rest that he could go 40 days on that bread and he went he went to mount sinai and he went to uh to the mountain and went to a cave in the mountain and god would come and god wouldn't yell at him but god would show his power and his might and then he would whisper a still small voice and what did he do to elijah he put elijah back in his commission what doest thou hear elijah he said well i've done this and that and they've chased my life and they've all forsaken me he listens to him wine but he says again what doest i'll hear elijah and he goes through it all again and god doesn't even deal with it he says go anoint jehu king of israel go anoint hezekiah king of syria go anoint elisha prophet and thy stead what is it you've got a work to do it's time to keep working i give you rest i give you food i listen to your whining but i've got something for you to do brother bam says in the uniting time and sign said one of my main things that i always hurt me through my life has been a nervous condition that when i get so worn then i get real weary how is it that we can understand elijah under the juniper tree so well because we've seen elijah in our day had to have that same nature that that same way so that he could be dealt with by god then when i get so warned then i get real weary kind of feel like nobody cares for you you know you have it too has anybody ever felt like nobody cares for you yes sir and just i happen to have a real overdose of it you know and it gets real bad sometime and i can hardly it's tension that's what does it and i get to a spot then that many times especially with so many of those visions you see it just gets me i look at a person i think this is a vision no no no it isn't yes it's no it's not you see and you just don't realize what a price goes with that so then you wonder then you get to thinking well then you get off your side and you say well now what have i what have i done here am i i'm 50 years old and i've done nothing for the lord and i'm getting old and what's oh my then you just get what we used to call the blues some of you brethren about my age remember what they used to call have the blues pop used to talk about it and i wondered what he meant and i sure now know what he meant so then you get to feeling that way which is none of it true it's just you you know it see you know it it's just you doing that it was his own cockabur nature doing that it was just you and i don't know about you but aren't you thankful he said that on tape aren't you thankful that he told you what real christianity was like not the fairy tale the reality none of it's true it's not true you just could feel that way and the feeling feels true but the feeling's never true so that's why we ignore the feeling you can't just change the feeling you say well i feel i feel really perplexed i feel really anxious i'm not going to feel anxious anymore good luck it's a real feeling it's in the cockpit nature you're not going to be able to change that but turn our attention from it and turn our attention back to what we know is true because we know that's not true that's temporal that'll change it was something different before that feeling came it'll be something different after that feeling leaves don't be afraid of it don't fixate on it don't identify with it come back to the things that we know are true and focus our attention on the things that we know to be true i want to just i want to read a couple spots and just show you that god understood his prophet he understood the nature that he would have he understood the benefits and he also understood the negatives he said in 1960 brother branham is talking about going beyond the curtain of time and he says i and i looked and i heard something kept saying you're just starting press the battle just keep pressing i shook my head a minute and then i thought well i probably just think just thinking like this you know and a person can get some imaginations and i said i just probably imagined that it said press the battle keep going keep going and i said maybe i said that i put my lips within my teeth and i put my hand over my mouth and there it come again said just keep pressing if you only knew what was at the end of the road and it seemed like i could hear graham snelling or somebody that sing that song like this that sings it here anna may and all of you all i am homesick and blue i want to see jesus i'd like to hear those sweet harbor bells chime it would be brighten my path and would vanish all fears lord let me look past the curtain of time you've heard it saying here at the church and i heard something say would you like to see just beyond the curtain i said it would help me so much brother man was laying there wondering about his ministry feeling like he hadn't accomplished anything for the lord he hadn't been a real success and god begins to come to him and he said would you like to see past the current time and the prophet said it would help me so much and i looked and just in a moment one breath i'd come into a little place that slanted i looked back and there was laying on the bed and i said this is a strange thing and god took him beyond the curtain of time and probably said it would help me so much but no matter how much help that was his tension came back again he began to have the same questions again and the same concerns again and then we find him in standing in the gap and we know the circumstances around standing in the gap he had come he had preached the seals it wasn't accepted and he began to build up a complex because people hadn't received his message and he wanted to run away and hide from the people and and he had a plan worked out and god was going to correct him but god wasn't just going to correct him because god also understood him god was going to do something wonderful for this prophet and he begins to explain it he you know he's driving along and he has that dream of him being a bum and then he sees those bums in the cafe and and then he's driving along again and god says if you go on with your plans that'll be you your wife won't stay up there and then and god corrects him and he recognizes he's wrong and is thinking he's wrong and he's just weary he's just tense he's just feeling rejected and he's he's upset he's built himself he said i built myself a complex who built the complex he did but then all of a sudden god tells him to pull over the car he pulls over the car and he says look there and he looks and he sees a mountain range the last mountain range before you go into another mountain range and there were seven peaks it says and there was three outstanding peaks those three peaks are the first second and third pool the first one was your first part of your ministry this is god speaking to him small hill then your first poll pretty high you know the sign in the hand and there was a little interval in there and that time that i was taken off he's explaining this mountain range as it goes up and down he said there was that little interval in there the time that i was taken off from being too tired that's when he was nervous had a nervous breakdown had to leave the field did god understand he wrote it in the mountain when he formed the earth did god know about his nervous tension and the trouble of the costume god already put the interval between the first and second pool god had laid a valley whenever he formed that mountain range and he formed it building up the ministry coming to the first pour he he when god the great artist of all creation when he dropped in a little valley here he knew it'd be a low point in his prophet's life he said then taken from that when i was taken off the field from being too tired many of you remember it and then come to discernment the second pool now i've had another about a few years here of just kind of little peaksy back like my ministry wasn't yet and then come the third one three is a number of completion see the third one the next peak was five number of grace and the next peak was seven the number perfection the end six days shall you labor the seventh the sabbath the end of the week the end of time see and i stopped and i showed it to billy and i looked at them he said that let that stand billy tells him let that stand if there's ever a doubt in your mind remember this place and come back here was ever a doubt in your mind remember this place and come back here god knew what nature that prophet would have and it had to be a certain nature like elijah amen it had to match and he had to use it to do the work that god called him to do but don't think god didn't understand and even when the prophet was having his trouble amen feeling rejected and building up a complex and wanting to leave the grind of the ministry and get away from the people amen god already knew god had already whenever he formed that mountain range he already wrote his whole life he said there's seven peaks and god said what's your name seven letters williams seven marion seven branham seven seven peaks your name is written in that mountain your life is in that mountain your ministry is in that mountain the high parts and the low parts were already foreseen by god and put in the mountain if god can do that for that man can he do it for you friends does he know your high spots and your low spots can it all work together for the program of god can we just let god be god amen and let him be in control and quit trying to figure everything out and say the high parts were god the low parts he knew about he wrote it he knew the interval he knew the spacing he knew the distance between the second and third pull and he knew the third pull would fade out into eternity what was that that was the tender hand of jehovah to take his prophet and say i know all about it son i know what you're thinking brother brahm hadn't said any of his plans about hurting and feeling rejected brother branham didn't just come up with a plan and say you know i'm going to stomp off i'm leaving the field i'm stomping up the to alaska i'll stomp out when i get a mess where did that come from that came from hurt he was wounded he was rejected and had a complex and wanted to get away from the pain amen and god knew it god timed it god had the mountain range in a certain spot and had the prophet driving at a certain time and knew what he would be thinking about on that road as he came near that mountain range and he knew when to stop the car he knew where it was he ordained it before the foundation of the world to encourage his prophet and to let him know i know all about it don't think that way you go that way you're thinking you're going to have trouble god loved him enough to stop him but not just to correct him god loved him enough that there was a savior with gentle hands that would say stop the car i want to show you something i've corrected you let me now encourage you it's all been for ordained i've known it all i know the nature you have and i know how you suffered with it but i know what i intended to do with it i know how much trouble amen the position you're in and how much stress it causes i know much trouble you're in i know i know how uh anxious you've become and i know how hurt you are amen but you can't go on with your plans that's wrong but look son i know i tell you friends god knows god knows what part of his your nature is serving his purpose and he knows what part of your nature is hurting you he knows about the circumstances our life he knows about the mind battles he knows about the the the fiery darts of the enemy that enter our mind he knows about the questions and he knows about the discouragement and he knows about all of these things he didn't just know for the prophet he knows for all of his children he knows where your high spots were and he knows where your low spots were he knows where your high spots will be and where your low spots will be god knows where it's at and god is not here to kick and he's not here he'll correct but he'll correct and show you no you can't go that way here's my plan for you and look i already know was it right for elijah to say take my life no but god knew where he was at god sent him back into action was it right for brother branham of his own choice to want to leave the ministry and deceive his wife no god corrected him but god knew where he was at and i say above all the comfort to my heart is god knows that this life we live as the bride of jesus christ is a paradox friend an absolute paradox that you have been called amen before the foundation of the world to manifest the very life of jesus christ in flesh but be but that flash that he's coming through is a flesh that has a sticky cultivar nature that's still remaining and gives you problems sometimes you've called amen to to move into the capstone of this great new testament to be all that the new testament is called to be you're called to be that and in the midst of that you can feel discouraged and in the midst of that you can feel stressed and strained and you can feel all of these things that the prophet felt that paul felt that they came under amen it is the paradox of being the bride of jesus christ in the end time not the fairy tale the reality but i tell you friends he's already written it in his mountain it's already in stone amen it's it's already in the book god already knows it was in his mind before the foundation of the world none of these things move him he's got a plan and he's working his plan and you've got a certain thing that you just have to ting in this life and so just let god get the ting out of your life and don't worry about the rest he knows about it focus on the inner man focus on the word and you'll see victory after victory after victory let's turn to psalms 40. i want to read two portions of scripture as we close psalms chapter 40. psalms 40 verse 1 i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cry he brought me up also out of a horrible pit and out of a mirey clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings and he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our god many shall see it in fear and shall trust in the lord blessed is that man that maketh the lord his trust and respect is not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies many o lord my god are thy wonderful works which thou has done and thy thoughts which are to us word they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee if i would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered does god love you oh yes he does does god know oh yes he does and your psyche is not your soul we don't have to succumb to the psyche we live by faith in the soul it's it's a paradox that you can be absolutely miserable in your mind and still have the joy of the lord in your heart you can be absolutely in your mind so uncertain of what's going to happen but so confident that god's got it worked out we are called to be a paradox in this world every born-again child of god is a paradox in this world you suffer through the same things the world suffers through but not the same way they suffer through it for you and i there's an anchor that holds there's a foundation within there's a truth that never fades away and our psyche is not our soul but the faith and the soul will overcome every day over and over day by day month by month year by year things will come they'll be overcome by faith things will come they'll be overcome by faith not something else will come it'll overcome by faith let's focus to the inner man and watch what god will do i want to read one more scripture as we close second corinthians chapter 4. ii corinthians chapter 4 and verse 16. for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but of the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal thank god for a revelation of eternal things and the eternal things in our life will always conquer and overcome the temporal things and the outer man let's all stand let's go to the lord the musicians and whether john will come this time let's just bow our heads and pray dear lord jesus oh god how we thank you that you're a heavenly father a loving father lord you know us like like you know us better than we know ourselves god when we see lord all your great men in the bible and how lord you watched over them and took care of them through their ups and through their downs the good times the bad times through the successes and through the failures lord you watched after them and you took care of them and you delivered them time after time after time and god we don't believe it was written there for their sakes alone but all of it was written for our sake lord that we'd have confidence in the day that we live in god i'm so thankful i'm so thankful to know that this old cockleburn nature is not me i'm so thankful for the revelation that the faith on the inside is who i really am and i don't have to give in to the thoughts and desires and lusts and confusions and stresses of the outer man the lord i can just keep going day by day in the renewal of my spirit in the inner man god let your word lord be our portion let your word be our life lord fill us with your spirit and help us lord by your grace to overcome all the obstacles that are around us god forgive us lord for our distresses forgive us for our complainings lord but i know you understand us you hear our cry your ear is bent towards our cry and you're ready to deliver and god when you knew the struggles of the prophet when you knew before he come on this life when you were forming the earth and out west lord you made a mountain range that would match his life so perfectly you knew he would have a valley you knew he would be low you knew he would come to distress and discouragement you knew he would have a complex and he would need to be freed from and god you're so tender and so loving that you laid a monument of a scale that no man could do to prove how much you love us and how much you know our life for our life is ordained and it's in your hands god i pray that this confidence would go deep into our hearts that we would no longer be afraid of the mental battles and struggles of the temptations of the of the questions of the uh the stresses and the anxieties lord help us not to fixate on those things help us not to be afraid of them lord let us know that that's just part of that old cocker burn nature but there's a wheat germ there's a real life a seed on the inside that's been quick in the life that's my overcoming portion that's my real life that is the pot that is the part that will change the rest you know and i pray that you'd bring us under your control under the control of your spirit you'd have preeminence that day by day you would have victory then you would take this vessel lord each one of us that you watched over to get us fashioned in a certain way to have a certain ring to our life that you can use god help us to surrender to your hand and let you have that ring let you have that pleasure of ringing that bell the way you want lord maybe not complain maybe not lord grumble but maybe just have faith in what you're doing and trust you to do it your way and at the end of this journey lord when it's all over you're gonna change this outer man anyhow so what does it matter you'll change our our psyche you'll change our flesh we'll never deal with those thoughts again we'll never deal with those stresses again we'll never deal with that discouragement again oh god help us to forget it now and just move on and trust you lord because you surely have a plan to change it all anyways it is not who we are but who we are is who you've made us lord who you've called us to be and who you've quickened us to be that's who we identify with lord give us courage give us wisdom give us your life to live in ours we yield ourselves to you and ask that you would have preeminence in us lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you brother
