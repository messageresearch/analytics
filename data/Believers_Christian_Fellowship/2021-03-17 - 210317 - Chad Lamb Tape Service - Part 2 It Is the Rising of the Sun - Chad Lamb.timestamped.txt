[8:13] service next wednesday to finish it and
[8:15] we're going to listen to just
[8:17] under an hour tonight we've got some
[8:20] quick questions as well but
[8:22] i want to go through our opening
[8:23] scriptures first so
[8:25] we're going to go back to the three
[8:26] opening scriptures that brother venom
[8:28] opened with
[8:28] and we'll begin in revelations chapter
[8:30] one so if you want to take your bibles
[8:32] and we want to make sure we keep these
[8:34] um the context what he's
[8:36] the the scriptures that he used to gain
[8:38] this context
[8:40] in our minds as we move forward so
[8:42] revelation chapter 1
[8:45] was the first scripture that he read and
[8:47] he read verse 17 and 18 and we'll read
[8:48] that now
[8:50] and when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[8:52] dead
[8:53] and he laid his right hand upon me
[8:54] saying unto me
[8:56] fear not i am the first and the last i
[8:58] am he that liveth and was dead
[9:00] and behold i am alive forevermore amen
[9:03] and have the keys
[9:05] of hell and of death my lord and my
[9:08] savior holds the keys of hell and of
[9:10] death
[9:11] what am i afraid of not hell and death
[9:14] that's for sure let's go back to romans
[9:17] chapter 8.
[9:19] this was the second scripture that
[9:21] brother branham read let's
[9:22] begin this service romans chapter 8
[9:27] and verse 11. romans 8 and 11 but if the
[9:31] spirit of him that raised up jesus from
[9:33] the dead
[9:34] dwell in you he that raised up christ
[9:36] from the dead shall also quicken your
[9:38] mortal bodies
[9:39] by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen
[9:42] let's go to mark 16.
[9:50] mark 16
[9:54] and brother brennan read verses 1 and 2.
[9:58] mark 16 verse 1 and when the sabbath was
[10:00] passed
[10:01] mary magdalene and mary the mother of
[10:03] james and psalmy
[10:05] had brought sweet spices that they might
[10:06] come and anoint him
[10:08] and very early in the morning the first
[10:10] day of the week they came into the
[10:11] sepulcher
[10:12] at the rising of the sun from this
[10:15] brother branham
[10:16] cross's text now he's going to go into
[10:18] another scripture
[10:20] in leviticus here in this next part so
[10:21] we'll turn and read that together
[10:23] leviticus chapter 23.
[10:31] in leviticus chapter 23
[10:36] and verse 9 leviticus 23 and 9.
[10:41] and the lord spake unto moses saying
[10:45] speaking to the children of israel and
[10:46] say unto them when you come into the
[10:48] land which i give unto you and shall
[10:50] reap the harvest thereof
[10:51] then you shall bring a sheaf of the
[10:53] first fruits of your harvest unto the
[10:55] priest
[10:56] and he shall wave the sheep before the
[10:57] lord to be accepted for you
[10:59] on the morrow after the sabbath the
[11:01] priest shall wave it
[11:03] amen so brother man we'll go into this
[11:05] and explain this for us
[11:06] if we'll take out our books and then
[11:08] we're going to we're going to go back
[11:10] and just review it just a couple
[11:11] uh read a couple quotes and review and
[11:13] then we'll go into our questions
[11:14] if you take your book you notice the
[11:16] title is it is the rising of the sun
[11:19] so we we noted last time that this is a
[11:21] very present tense title
[11:23] it is the rising of the sun this isn't
[11:25] time to reflect back although they come
[11:27] to
[11:28] an easter service this is going to be
[11:30] the last easter message that brother
[11:31] venom is going to preach
[11:33] in his earthly journey until he returns
[11:35] in a glorified body in the millennium
[11:37] but this
[11:38] this is the last message he's going to
[11:40] preach amen and
[11:42] and so the last easter message i'm sorry
[11:44] that he's gonna preach
[11:45] and this message is from april 18 1965
[11:48] so we always want to note where we are
[11:50] in the ministry and where we are in time
[11:52] and he's preaching in jeffersonville
[11:54] and he's telling us that it is the
[11:55] rising of the sun brother venom is not
[11:57] just looking back
[11:58] but he's taking us back in that day to
[12:00] show us the reality of what happened
[12:02] and what it means to us and he's asking
[12:05] was it just a tradition is it just a one
[12:07] day in the year was it just then
[12:09] or is it is the resurrection for me now
[12:12] and he's trying to let us know it's for
[12:13] us now that it is the rising of the sun
[12:17] so if we could turn together
[12:21] to paragraph
[12:25] 30. i'm going to pull out a little
[12:28] highlight a few little highlights for
[12:30] review
[12:34] paragraph 30 on page 5. sorry page 5
[12:36] paragraph 30
[12:38] it says satan doesn't satan doesn't care
[12:40] how religious you are
[12:41] or how right you are in your doctrine if
[12:43] you miss that life you won't come up
[12:46] anyhow
[12:47] no matter how religious how good how
[12:49] many churches you belong to or will
[12:50] belong to
[12:51] it doesn't matter one thing unless you
[12:53] have been born
[12:54] again this is the point brother is
[12:56] trying to drive home
[12:58] amen there's a resurrection for us let's
[13:01] turn to page seven
[13:06] and read paragraph 41 at the top
[13:10] page seven at the top but this time when
[13:12] the sun rose there was a dual sun rising
[13:15] another sun son rising it was not only
[13:18] the sun rising it was the s-o-n
[13:20] had risen to bring eternal life to all
[13:22] god's promised seed
[13:24] that by foreknowledge he had seen laying
[13:26] upon the earth
[13:28] no no more could the botany life live
[13:30] back there at the beginning without the
[13:32] s-u-n to bring it to life
[13:33] no more than today when sons of god is
[13:36] upon the earth it takes to eson light to
[13:38] bring them to eternal life
[13:39] his chosen ones that he knew before the
[13:41] foundation of the world
[13:43] he had chosen them in himself before the
[13:45] foundation of the world
[13:46] and on easter morning then in this dirt
[13:48] somewhere laid our bodies at that time
[13:50] for we are the dust of the earth
[13:52] and in heaven there was a book of memory
[13:54] and his attributes was in him
[13:55] knowing that because this son of god
[13:58] raised it would also
[13:59] raise to life every sun that was
[14:01] foreordained to this great time
[14:03] he knew it would be and what a more
[14:05] glorious sunrise that was than it was at
[14:07] the beginning at the time when it first
[14:09] dawned
[14:09] now on this great breaking of the easter
[14:12] seal
[14:13] praise god
[14:18] amen let's turn to page 9 and paragraph
[14:28] 54.
[14:30] 54 on top of page 9. and then not only
[14:33] that he sent word to his disciples his
[14:35] believing
[14:36] fear not for i am he that was dead and
[14:38] is alive again forevermore
[14:39] and i have the keys to death and hell
[14:41] i've already conquered him
[14:43] don't fear any more for every
[14:45] foreordained predestinated seed of god
[14:47] shall come to life when that light
[14:49] spreads across the earth
[14:50] of the glorious gospel in every age
[14:52] it'll bring forth the crop
[14:54] that god ordained it to do he had raised
[14:57] from the dead
[14:58] oh what a wonderful thing that is i'm
[15:00] alive or quickened the word
[15:01] the word the word means the word quicken
[15:04] the greek word means something that's
[15:06] made alive after death
[15:07] like the seed that goes into the earth
[15:09] it has to die every bit of that seed it
[15:11] has to rot
[15:12] every bit of the seed and every bit of
[15:13] the life that was in the seed has to
[15:15] come forth again
[15:16] he was quick and not only that and will
[15:18] send that same life that quickened me
[15:21] the power that brought me from the grave
[15:23] i will send it upon you to quicken you
[15:25] that where i am there you will be also
[15:29] this is the great meaning of easter
[15:35] all right now let's go to paragraph 12
[15:39] and we're going to begin on paragraph
[15:41] 12.
[15:42] i'm going to read the questions here in
[15:43] just a minute but we're going to start
[15:45] right at the beginning of page 12 on
[15:47] paragraph 76
[15:49] page 12 at the top on paragraph 76
[15:52] and we're going to go to page 30 it'll
[15:55] be just
[15:55] under an hour and we're going to go to
[15:58] the bottom of paragraph 231
[16:00] so that's what we're looking to do today
[16:03] now let's go to the questions if we
[16:04] could pull up the powerpoint
[16:06] brother franco all right
[16:10] we've only got four today
[16:14] the first one is what is the wave sheath
[16:17] so you want to write these down
[16:18] these come in chronological order like i
[16:20] said there's no trick questions
[16:22] this is just something to keep us all
[16:24] tuned in together
[16:27] what is the wave sheath
[16:31] and number two what are the mechanics
[16:34] and the dynamics
[16:37] what are the mechanics and the dynamics
[16:42] and i just want to make a disclaimer if
[16:43] there's anything on here that's spelled
[16:45] incorrectly
[16:47] it is microsoft's fault and not mine
[16:50] because they have spell check so
[16:55] what are the mechanics and the dynamics
[16:59] number three how is this mortal flesh
[17:02] going to become
[17:03] his flesh this is probably the most
[17:05] important question
[17:07] of them all how is this mortal flesh
[17:11] going to become his flesh
[17:16] praise the lord number three how is this
[17:20] mortal flesh going to become
[17:24] his flesh
[17:33] and number four
[17:38] how were sins remitted by the apostles
[17:43] so he's going to get into this our sins
[17:45] remitted
[17:47] by the apostles
[17:51] those are our four questions as you
[17:54] listen
[17:55] to the message you'll these you'll come
[17:57] across these brother venom answers all
[17:59] of these
[18:00] and then when we're done we'll get up
[18:02] and we'll go through these and discuss
[18:03] them and pull out highlights
[18:06] so i think that's everything check my
[18:09] notes here
[18:12] yes that's everything all right we'll
[18:14] begin at the top of page 12 on paragraph
[18:16] 76. brother franco if you can go ahead
[18:19] and turn on the message
[18:21] uh them who were once groping in
[18:25] darkness and wandering around if they
[18:27] should wash
[18:28] feet on this day or if they should keep
[18:30] a certain day or do a certain set of
[18:32] rules all
[18:32] those things passed away well that was a
[18:35] glorious resurrection
[18:37] that defied every man-made thing that
[18:40] man had ever done
[18:42] every man-made reason there had never
[18:45] been to that time a man that could lay
[18:46] his life down and pick it up again
[18:49] he defied that scientific proof they had
[18:52] by raising again when they say
[18:55] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[18:57] forever that his power
[18:59] isn't the same that is gospel this is
[19:01] the same when the bible says it's the
[19:03] same
[19:04] god define every denomination never
[19:06] creed
[19:07] and he moved forth with his holy spirit
[19:09] as he promised
[19:10] hence proved it to us as he
[19:13] is alive we are the benefactors
[19:17] of his resurrection quicken
[19:21] after being said in the world and sin
[19:23] and trespasses
[19:24] he has quickened us together with him
[19:27] raised with him now sitting in heavenly
[19:30] places in christ jesus
[19:33] his brain is spirit brings his same life
[19:36] again on the earth if the spirit of god
[19:40] that raised up christ the body the
[19:43] anointed
[19:44] blocking if the spirit of god anointed
[19:46] that body
[19:47] in such a way that when that seed fell
[19:50] into the earth
[19:52] you just wouldn't let him rest there no
[19:55] he quickly raised him up
[19:58] that same spirit by the same works by
[20:02] the same power
[20:03] by the same signs being you
[20:06] he'll also raise you up
[20:11] i'd like to read a little scripture here
[20:12] for you i'd like for you to turn to
[20:14] another scripture
[20:16] i got wrote down here it might help you
[20:17] a little is found
[20:20] in the book of leviticus the 23rd
[20:22] chapter
[20:23] the ninth to the eleventh verse
[20:26] listen close in the law of levitical law
[20:29] god speaking to moses
[20:33] listen all these things
[20:36] are tight now and we'll stop here for a
[20:39] few moments
[20:40] to get into this type and the lord spake
[20:44] unto moses saying
[20:46] speak unto the children of israel
[20:50] and say unto them when you come into the
[20:53] land which i
[20:54] give unto you unto
[20:57] the place of position
[21:01] that i have given unto you now you speak
[21:04] to the children of israel
[21:07] that when you get to this certain place
[21:10] that i
[21:10] promise you
[21:14] i take you when you get there in this
[21:17] land
[21:17] now speaking natural here type in the
[21:19] spiritual
[21:21] and shall reap the harvest thereof you
[21:24] may receive what i told you
[21:26] thereof then you shall bring a sheath
[21:30] of the first fruit of your harvest
[21:34] unto the priest and he shall wave the
[21:37] sheep
[21:38] before the lord to be
[21:41] accepted for you all tomorrow
[21:45] after the sabbath
[21:48] the priest shall weave it
[21:52] if there would be any holy ritual
[21:55] it should come forth on the sabbath day
[21:59] which was the seventh day of the week
[22:02] which is saturday
[22:05] but did you notice in this memorial
[22:09] the wave it on the first day of the week
[22:16] the sheep which was the first
[22:19] of your seed that you planted
[22:22] when it comes up and ripened you cut
[22:26] down this sheath
[22:28] and take it to the priest and let him
[22:32] take it
[22:32] and wave it before the lord
[22:36] for your exception that you are accepted
[22:40] you have come with your sheath and he's
[22:42] the wave it before the lord
[22:44] on not on the sabbath the seventh day
[22:48] but on the first date which we call
[22:52] sunday s-u-n-d-a-y
[22:56] of course that's a roman uh word
[23:00] which they called it the sunday for the
[23:02] sun god
[23:03] but how it is changed it's not s-u-n
[23:07] anymore it's the s-o-n-d-a why
[23:10] the sunday that that carnal week
[23:15] god's first one up from today
[23:19] is to be waived over the congregation
[23:24] that we are his seed
[23:28] and that's the first of the seeds of
[23:30] those that slip
[23:32] waved upon the first day of the week on
[23:35] sunday
[23:36] he raised up waves
[23:40] goodbye and ascended up on han
[23:43] in the presence of the people notice
[23:46] it was the first corner of god's wheat
[23:49] that
[23:50] had been raised from today
[23:53] god's first corner week by god's
[23:55] quickening
[23:56] power god had quickened his life
[24:00] raised him up from the dead and he was
[24:02] the first fruits of those that slept
[24:05] the first fruit he was that sheep that's
[24:08] why they had to weigh that sheep
[24:10] or it was the first one that come to
[24:12] maturity
[24:15] and it was weighed as a memorial of
[24:18] thanksgiving to god
[24:19] believing that the rest of them would
[24:21] come there was a sign
[24:24] and today because he was the first
[24:27] son of god to come to full maturity to
[24:30] be in god
[24:32] he was plucked up from the earth as
[24:34] waved over the people
[24:37] oh what a glorious lesson by the
[24:40] quickening power
[24:41] the first one although it you've been
[24:43] typed in many times and we'll see later
[24:46] that he was types but this is really the
[24:48] first fruits
[24:49] of them that slept he was waved
[24:52] over the promised seed
[24:56] that had promised of life he was waved
[24:59] at the day of pentecost
[25:01] when there came a sound from heaven like
[25:03] a waving
[25:04] mighty rushing wind and was waved
[25:08] over the people the pentecostal people
[25:11] that was up at pentecost waiting for uh
[25:14] the blessing to come
[25:16] and to be waived again
[25:19] we realized in the last days according
[25:22] to luke 17
[25:23] 30 in the sunday again in the days that
[25:25] the
[25:26] ethon of man will be revealed
[25:29] or waved again over the people who is
[25:32] the son of man
[25:34] in the beginning was the word and the
[25:37] word was with god
[25:38] and the word was god and the word would
[25:42] make flesh
[25:43] and dwelt among us and of all the
[25:46] teaching that we have in confirmation
[25:49] of the word of god by word of god by
[25:52] signed by wonders we see
[25:55] the day that in the book of of luke here
[25:59] as we just quoted from the the luke the
[26:01] 17th chapter the 31st
[26:03] and malachi 4 in the different
[26:05] scriptures that we are acquainted with
[26:07] that that word again is waved
[26:11] over the people that the dead traditions
[26:14] of
[26:15] man is dead and the shot of god is alive
[26:19] again with the baptism of the holy
[26:20] spirit right among us
[26:22] has given us life
[26:26] as christ was the first one to
[26:29] raise from all the prophets and so forth
[26:33] all those types in many places he was
[26:35] the first fruits of those that slept
[26:37] and the pride coming up christ coming
[26:40] out of the church
[26:41] there will have to be a sheep ways to
[26:44] get in the laces
[26:46] oh my gosh
[26:50] waiting of the sheep what was the sheath
[26:52] the first one that come to mature
[26:55] the first one that proved it was a wheat
[26:58] that proved it was a sheep
[27:00] hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm
[27:03] talking about
[27:04] [Applause]
[27:05] he was waved over the people and the
[27:08] first time there will come forth
[27:10] for the fraud age for a resurrection out
[27:13] of
[27:14] dark denominationalism it will be a
[27:17] message
[27:18] that's the form full maturity all the
[27:20] word has turned back again
[27:22] in his full power and being waved over
[27:24] the people
[27:25] by the same kinds of wonders that he did
[27:28] that
[27:29] all right it's called alien ye live also
[27:33] speaking to his wife
[27:35] because i live you live also
[27:39] what a resurrection that that was
[27:42] and what a resurrection this is
[27:46] to be quickened from the deity to be
[27:48] made alive
[27:50] in christ jesus by god's quickness power
[27:54] he was waved to them the word which he
[27:58] was
[27:58] was way back to him on the day of
[28:00] pentecost the word
[28:02] made manifest now and he's our stage to
[28:05] be waved again in the last days
[28:08] now for instance you say when i waited
[28:11] brother branham
[28:12] i know a church said well i do too
[28:15] but now for instance what if if we were
[28:18] going to go
[28:19] back to tucson this afternoon
[28:23] now and each one of us had a was going
[28:26] to go in a
[28:28] a big cadillac brand new
[28:31] and all of the seats were made out of
[28:35] a blue skin softness of the leather
[28:39] soft and easy to sit in and the
[28:42] floorboards
[28:43] were plush the steering wheel
[28:46] were nickel plated and had diamond studs
[28:49] all over
[28:51] and the engine was mechanically
[28:54] tested to be exactly the right engine
[28:58] and the wheels were all had bearings and
[29:01] greased up
[29:03] and the tires were all puncture proof
[29:06] and blow out freeze
[29:08] all been tested scientifically they've
[29:12] been pushed off the assembly line
[29:14] both of them and both of them filled up
[29:16] with gasoline
[29:18] that's the running power the gasoline
[29:22] because it is the option but now
[29:26] when you're going to start them
[29:30] all those that look just alike
[29:34] but there's one of them don't have any
[29:36] spark
[29:39] any firing power
[29:42] well you say the power is in the
[29:44] gasoline brother brand
[29:46] but i don't care how much power is in
[29:48] the gasoline unless there's a spark
[29:51] there
[29:52] to manifest this power
[29:55] that there's a power there to confirm
[29:59] that this gasoline
[30:00] it just might as well be water
[30:03] until no matter how much theologians
[30:07] claim how well you got your church set
[30:10] how much education you got how much like
[30:13] the bible
[30:13] until that wave sheath until the
[30:17] holy spirit comes upon that
[30:21] person to quicken that word
[30:24] the gasoline represents the word it's
[30:26] the truth but without the spirit it
[30:29] won't move
[30:33] we put too much stress on the mechanics
[30:37] and nothing on the dynamics
[30:40] it needs the dynamic power of god
[30:43] the resurrection power of jesus christ
[30:46] upon the church to
[30:48] manifest him and to bring to pass it
[30:51] this
[30:52] is gasoline
[30:54] [Music]
[30:56] it might be in a gasoline can it should
[30:58] still be water
[31:02] see but the only proof of it
[31:05] is put this life on it
[31:08] and it'll prove where it's getting
[31:09] special
[31:11] and when you try to put the holy spirit
[31:15] in the denomination you're as much as
[31:17] trying you get a splatter
[31:21] you'll ruin your engine by getting it
[31:24] full of carbon
[31:27] but all i'm so fast that there is a 10
[31:30] thousand
[31:31] power the word of god and a holy
[31:35] ghost
[31:35] hide it up and to resurrect the power of
[31:39] god
[31:40] into a man's life or a woman's life or
[31:42] into a church
[31:44] that shoved that cadillac down the road
[31:49] under the dynamic power of the holy
[31:52] ghost
[31:53] which came back to us ways over the
[31:54] people at the day of pentecost
[31:56] making him the same yesterday today and
[31:58] forever
[32:00] that was the first sheep come up from
[32:02] all the prophets which was the son of
[32:03] god
[32:04] the king of all prophets there's been
[32:06] churches churches bribes brides churches
[32:08] bride brides
[32:09] but there's got to come one
[32:12] [Music]
[32:22] [Music]
[32:30] in the power of his resurrection
[32:33] until we come to that place until we
[32:36] find that place what good does it do to
[32:39] polish the hubs
[32:41] what good does it do to give her a
[32:43] facelift you're assigning a job
[32:46] when there's no dynamics in it no matter
[32:49] how much the mechanics prove to be right
[32:52] there's got to be a dynamic to make it
[32:54] work
[32:55] that's what he proves
[33:00] that's what easter proved he wasn't only
[33:04] the word
[33:05] but he was god himself the dynamics in
[33:08] the word
[33:12] the body of jesus christ cold stepping
[33:16] dead in the grave
[33:17] shake it alive and rise again and roll
[33:19] away
[33:22] i am he that was dead so
[33:25] dead till the sun said he was dead the
[33:27] moon said he was dead
[33:28] the star said he was dead all nature
[33:31] said he was dead
[33:32] now the whole world has to recognize
[33:34] that he's alive again
[33:36] he was not only a mechanic god's word he
[33:40] was a dynamic to prove it
[33:42] and is he being the group today
[33:46] the bride has to come forth called this
[33:48] part of him
[33:50] and it can only be the manifestation of
[33:53] the fulfilling
[33:54] of all the revelations and the others
[33:56] that spoke of the bride
[33:57] it can only manifest if it does
[34:00] something different from the groom
[34:01] it isn't the bra because she's flesh
[34:05] of his flesh bone of his bone life of
[34:09] his life
[34:10] power of his power she is him
[34:15] as man and woman are one and woman taken
[34:18] from his side
[34:19] she had taken a spirit defeated his
[34:21] spirit coming the flesh from his side
[34:23] made both mechanics and dynamics the
[34:26] wife
[34:28] the spirit of him and the flesh of him
[34:32] and put it together and make mechanics
[34:34] and dynamics
[34:36] and tell the church or the people all
[34:38] these easter bunnies these ceremonies
[34:40] as big churches and pirates will fail
[34:43] and pass away
[34:45] until that church both diabetic
[34:48] and mechanics and the spirit of god
[34:52] that moved him to do the things that he
[34:54] did if
[34:55] he hit on 16 cylinders so
[35:00] hey why is that in john 14
[35:03] 12 see that's what he belong with me
[35:06] the works that i do shall he love
[35:10] [Applause]
[35:12] amen i'll give him a charge of my
[35:14] dynamics
[35:27] [Music]
[35:29] and the mechanics together the mechanics
[35:32] without the dynamics
[35:34] no good neither is the dynamics without
[35:37] the mechanics
[35:38] you can scream and shout and jump up
[35:39] down all you want to and deny this word
[35:42] amen you won't do any good if you're
[35:45] just cranking around
[35:46] the pistons have got sparked out of fire
[35:48] but no gas need to far back
[35:51] it'll only work as they come together
[35:54] amen so one will set still and the other
[35:57] will go up
[35:59] that's the only thing there is to it yes
[36:01] they both might look like both claim to
[36:02] be churches proclaim to be bribed
[36:04] but one has mechanics and dynamics
[36:09] it brings it to pass so what he said is
[36:11] the truth
[36:12] it just won't move no matter how good
[36:16] the mechanics is
[36:17] until the dynamics comes when a diamond
[36:19] it comes
[36:20] that bar is made to connect with that
[36:23] octane in the gasoline
[36:24] and when that explosion that causes a
[36:27] combustion
[36:29] and that combustion moves
[36:33] every emotion ever moved or he is the
[36:37] pain
[36:38] yesterday today and foreign
[36:41] that's the resurrection that's the real
[36:43] power of god
[36:44] mechanics with the dynamics notice
[36:48] it's the spirit that quickens it's the
[36:52] it's the spark that fires
[36:55] it's not the gas that fires it's the
[36:57] spark that fires the gas
[36:59] see you can do nothing without me but
[37:02] with me you can do all things
[37:05] as he is the words the father living
[37:07] father sent me so send i you
[37:09] as the father has fired me and pushed me
[37:11] into everything i do only that which is
[37:13] pleasing to god
[37:14] now as he sent me swords and i use the
[37:17] same mechanics
[37:18] it takes the same dynamics to operate it
[37:21] and these signs shall follow
[37:23] them that claim to have the mechanics
[37:25] the dynamics will take its place
[37:27] paul said the gospel came to us not in
[37:29] word only through gasoline only but
[37:31] through spark also
[37:33] to make it move came to us in that
[37:36] manner
[37:37] it's the same spirit that raised him up
[37:40] that quickened the true believer to
[37:42] eternal life
[37:44] i remember potentially now watch as we
[37:47] are getting out of our time
[37:49] notice the same spirit now romans 8 1
[37:52] let's just read that again in romans 8 1
[37:56] and we'll see what that says
[37:59] all right and not romans i mean 8 11 i'm
[38:02] sorry
[38:03] and romans 8 11. but
[38:06] if there's a problem there's this catch
[38:10] but if the spirit of him god
[38:13] the holy spirit that raised up jesus
[38:17] from the dead
[38:18] 12 in you
[38:22] oh there you are
[38:25] if the bridegroom spirit dwells in the
[38:29] bride
[38:31] when god made his first bride grew
[38:34] he made the bridegroom first and he was
[38:38] both man
[38:39] and woman in spirit forming in the dust
[38:42] of the earth and making material
[38:44] and notice when he made e from adam
[38:47] he took not another piece of clay
[38:51] he took from the same piece of clay the
[38:54] same word
[38:55] or adam was the spoken word see he took
[38:59] from him and then taken the
[39:00] he had masculine and feminist spirit
[39:03] and he took the feminist spirit away
[39:05] from adam
[39:07] and placed it in eaves who are still
[39:09] part of adam's
[39:10] fears it's adam's flesh
[39:14] then it was adam's spirit the dynamics
[39:17] that quickened the mechanics of his body
[39:20] so the bride must
[39:21] also be flesh of his flesh
[39:24] and bone of his bones then how is this
[39:27] mortal flesh go become his flesh
[39:29] we'll get to it how is it done
[39:33] how what is this great transformation
[39:35] notice
[39:36] now if the spirit
[39:39] of him god that raised up jesus from the
[39:43] dead
[39:44] dwell in you he that raised up christ
[39:48] from the dead shall also
[39:50] quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit
[39:53] that dwelleth in you
[39:56] oh the projected ones
[40:01] of course like the seed laid up on the
[40:02] earth the one that had
[40:04] life and many of them are dead they were
[40:07] just rotten seeds
[40:08] but waters and things burn them out but
[40:11] you know there was a seed laying there
[40:14] ready for life god know it was laying
[40:16] there now
[40:18] the predestinated ones are the first to
[40:21] be quickened by the holy spirit
[40:23] for the holy spirit comes to claim
[40:26] its own how this is deep now
[40:31] be sure to catch this good
[40:34] now as the sun was set across the earth
[40:37] not to bring rocks which was dirt also
[40:40] to lie it was not to bring all the dirt
[40:44] fell right but was to bring the part of
[40:47] the dirt
[40:48] which was enclosed around the line
[40:53] not all men will receive crimes oh no
[40:58] but those which god for ordained
[41:02] life is housed around some of the dirt
[41:06] of the earth
[41:07] that's when it comes to quicken they're
[41:09] the ones that now that dirt would lay
[41:11] there in the sun and say oh this old
[41:12] sun's so hot
[41:13] that rock said there's no sun so hot but
[41:16] that little seed said that's what i'm
[41:17] looking for
[41:18] and they begin to spring forth the line
[41:21] it quickened
[41:22] that part of the dirt because
[41:25] the sun was sent
[41:28] not to quicken the rock not to
[41:31] quicken the earth but to quicken the
[41:34] life
[41:35] of the seed now the holy spirit comes
[41:40] down
[41:41] of course it wasn't fat why won't all
[41:43] the people receive it
[41:44] it wasn't said to him god told me i
[41:47] don't believe
[41:48] i don't care what you said you could
[41:49] raise up the dead or anything heal the
[41:50] sick and prove it anyway i still don't
[41:52] believe that it's going on
[41:54] you're unbelievers it don't mean a thing
[41:56] to you it wasn't sent to you
[41:59] it's said to those who will believe the
[42:01] message is to the believer
[42:04] to them to perish is foolishness but to
[42:07] them that are in christ and part of that
[42:09] seed is life
[42:11] my crude little story about the farmer
[42:14] putting the egg on
[42:15] the eagle egg under the heat see that
[42:18] little eagle was absolutely he was a
[42:20] he was an odd-looking little creature
[42:22] when this uh farmer had
[42:24] did that thing that he did to put this
[42:26] uh eagle egg under this old hand
[42:28] and she had shot a funny looking chicken
[42:32] it was a it was odd a little salty
[42:33] didn't look like him his feathers wasn't
[42:35] like the rest of him and
[42:36] he he just he was not a little tired and
[42:39] uh all the rested chickens recognized
[42:41] him in odds and
[42:44] the hen went around he didn't even like
[42:45] the dike she was feeding me
[42:47] he just didn't like that scratching in
[42:49] the barnyard he he didn't have nothing
[42:50] to do with it
[42:51] so he wondered why he had to be the odd
[42:53] one around there
[42:56] and he never tasted anything that he
[42:58] just eat enough to keep him alive
[43:00] because he didn't like the taste of it
[43:02] i think because he wants a chicken too
[43:06] and uh the hand would cluck and you know
[43:09] there's a miracle just back there is no
[43:11] such a thing to join the church
[43:14] it just didn't hit right with the little
[43:16] guy so
[43:17] he fought around the hands until one day
[43:22] his mammy the old eagle old laid
[43:25] so many eggs
[43:28] and there was one missing
[43:32] she knew that that eagle was somewhere
[43:36] so she starts out on the hunt party
[43:39] and she's circled over the mountain top
[43:41] and down in the valleys
[43:42] over and everywhere before he might of
[43:45] be
[43:46] by this time it's time for him to be
[43:48] born
[43:49] the time frame be hatched out so maybe a
[43:53] crow coming to pick up my egg
[43:55] maybe a vulture i don't know if
[43:58] something picked up my egg
[44:00] but i know that egg is in my mind
[44:04] [Music]
[44:05] hallelujah got a son somewhere
[44:10] i got the honey
[44:14] so he's gone he's that great eagle
[44:17] in his thoughts he wanted to have a
[44:19] church in order to have a people
[44:22] no matter what cuddled him no matter
[44:24] what he's hatched out under
[44:26] he's hunting he's hunting for his own
[44:31] and one day the story goes this old
[44:34] eagle
[44:34] flew over the barnyard just looking at
[44:37] what you found
[44:39] oh for that resurrection to recognize
[44:43] that he really wasn't chicken natural
[44:46] he was an eagle
[44:49] and he's always taught to look down look
[44:52] for a bug or something in the barnyard
[44:55] but he heard a scream and said look up
[44:57] this way
[44:59] and he looked above him and there was a
[45:02] creature
[45:03] but 14 feet wings
[45:06] powerful and all the chickens he was in
[45:08] a barney heart
[45:10] and claimed him to be her son
[45:14] he said mama how can it get to you they
[45:16] just jump start flopping your
[45:18] hands or you're an eagle see
[45:21] she knew she had a son somewhere
[45:26] no matter what he's been raised up in
[45:29] she's got a son somewhere god knows
[45:33] hallelujah he's got a predestinated
[45:36] foreign church
[45:39] you know he's got sons and daughters and
[45:40] a bride waiting somewhere
[45:43] when the holy spirit begins to fly over
[45:46] that wave she
[45:49] he's the same yesterday for everybody
[45:52] not some
[45:52] mythical story but a reality
[45:57] no matter how i might try to tell him
[45:58] the eagle he didn't know what a eagle
[45:59] was
[46:00] yet he was an eagle he would understood
[46:03] it
[46:04] until he seen something that reflected
[46:08] him
[46:09] that he reflected rather and when we see
[46:12] not a denomination not a phd
[46:16] not a lld not a good neighbor
[46:21] but a son of god molded in the image of
[46:25] god with the dynamic power of god
[46:28] to answer the request of this day that
[46:30] he's the same yesterday today and
[46:31] forever
[46:32] there ain't no hen going to hold you
[46:36] he hunts for his mama
[46:39] he's an eagle to begin with he
[46:42] recognizes
[46:43] this real eagle recognizes the call of
[46:46] god's word
[46:47] why he's an eagle a eagle to an eagle
[46:53] the word before the foundation the word
[46:56] to the word amen the word predestinated
[47:00] to the word written
[47:02] for the hour you realize your position
[47:05] he hunts for it this then this
[47:11] earthly body is quickened
[47:14] and brought by the quickening spirit of
[47:16] god to obedience to the word of god
[47:20] quickly what do you want to know how i
[47:22] can get there with her
[47:24] he'd been taught he couldn't do that you
[47:26] can't get a higher
[47:27] jump he's a chicken
[47:31] but this eagle said that's not soul well
[47:34] look at the chickens no matter what the
[47:36] chickens are your eagles
[47:39] just start spreading those wings get a
[47:41] little exercise in him
[47:43] start moving up the word to the word
[47:47] the works that i do shall you also he
[47:50] that believeth in me
[47:51] the works that i do shall he also
[47:54] because i live
[47:55] he lives also into the spirit that
[47:57] raised him from the dead
[47:58] dwells in you he quickens your mortal
[48:00] body see
[48:02] what does it do now listen to what you
[48:04] know that this easter i want to mean
[48:05] more to you than any easter egg
[48:08] i want you to see we know what it's done
[48:10] for him but i want you to see
[48:12] it's not well it has done the same for
[48:14] you amen
[48:16] what does it do it quickens the mortal
[48:19] body
[48:20] this mortal body that we live in it
[48:22] quickens it in other words
[48:23] brings it to life now you who once
[48:25] walked along with a great big cigar in
[48:27] your mouth and
[48:28] everything a bunch of cigarettes and you
[48:29] women who once had short hair and
[48:31] painted and
[48:32] carried on more sharks and things like
[48:33] that oh it wants something scream
[48:35] and you look down here and it was the
[48:36] word saying
[48:38] it quickened your you said no more
[48:40] shorts
[48:42] no more liquor for me no more no more
[48:45] stealing no more
[48:46] see the spirit that raised him from the
[48:49] dead
[48:50] dwelling in you will also bring your
[48:54] mortal bodies
[48:56] look at the rest of the earth into
[48:58] subjection you see
[48:59] what is it subjection of love christ who
[49:01] is christ the word
[49:04] not the theology but the word
[49:08] then you say that these things oh i
[49:10] think it's hard for women to wear
[49:12] uh slack when the words said no
[49:15] think it quits you do that you're drawn
[49:18] to it
[49:19] see it's you then it becomes you become
[49:22] part of the word
[49:22] it brought your body not well you say
[49:25] well now let me tell you something my
[49:26] pastor
[49:27] what your pastor said what the word said
[49:30] if you want to be a chicken go on with
[49:32] them
[49:32] but if the pastor speaks different from
[49:34] this word then he's not a feeder of the
[49:36] eagles
[49:37] he's the feeder of the hymns see not of
[49:40] the eagles
[49:41] the eagle eats on eagles from there
[49:44] they acquainted the bible said strongly
[49:46] that the man and so forth and what all
[49:48] you do
[49:48] it's wrong say days and miracles just
[49:49] pass this bible said he's the same
[49:51] yesterday forever
[49:52] let's say that's mental telepathy
[49:54] there's some kind of mind reading this
[49:55] discernment all these
[49:56] divisions and things is nonsense they
[49:58] are chickens that's right
[50:00] they don't know what eagle food is but
[50:03] brother when you hear that scream
[50:04] there's something in you your ego should
[50:06] begin with
[50:06] why you are the seed
[50:09] that the resurrection of the s o n
[50:12] has gone in the wave sheep upon the
[50:15] earth to make you recognize that you are
[50:17] an
[50:17] eagle and not a denominational chicken
[50:21] you see it if the spirit that raised him
[50:25] from the dead the word
[50:27] the dynamic of the word dwells in you
[50:32] it also quickens your mortal body now
[50:34] how we flesh to be flesh and born in his
[50:36] bones
[50:36] because quickly while we're at mortal
[50:38] sinners
[50:40] mortal ready to die these bodies it
[50:42] quickens that body
[50:44] what's quick it brings the line the
[50:47] spirit that wants like to drink run
[50:49] around commit adultery and all these
[50:50] it's quickened well the thing died
[50:55] and you're resurrected it quickens your
[50:58] mortal body
[50:59] therefore your body is the temple
[51:03] of the dynamics because why
[51:06] from the beginning you are part of the
[51:08] mechanics
[51:12] there's your resurrection there's the
[51:15] church in the resurrection
[51:17] these bodies right now are quickened
[51:20] okay you've heard you believe it changed
[51:23] you
[51:24] from a denomination to the word see
[51:28] the dynamic if it comes upon
[51:31] water it will splutter taste america
[51:34] want to breathe
[51:47] strike a chicken it won't do no good but
[51:49] when he strikes the eagle
[51:50] he moves out the dynamic
[51:54] with the mechanics you know what i mean
[51:57] that is
[51:58] if he is a true eagle now
[52:02] he will understand let me straighten a
[52:04] little scripture here for you
[52:06] i think we're off of the poem but we are
[52:08] still
[52:09] here amen uh saint john 5
[52:13] 24 jesus said he that
[52:16] teareth my word and believe it's on him
[52:18] and say he has
[52:20] everlasting life now look i go down the
[52:22] street and take that literally what it
[52:24] is without the spiritual understanding i
[52:26] may just say nothing else
[52:27] but it's saying what it says see the
[52:30] right
[52:30] word there in the greek in the original
[52:33] it says he that understandeth my word
[52:37] now to prove that's right i go down
[52:39] yours there's a drunk coming along
[52:40] they're speaking
[52:41] with some other man's wife on his arms
[52:43] and
[52:44] cussing and taking god's name in vain
[52:46] and everything else like that
[52:47] say did you hear what that preacher said
[52:50] did you
[52:50] yeah i heard it that don't mean he's got
[52:53] eternal life
[52:56] he that understandeth my word
[52:59] he that is an eagle
[53:02] now brother brown want more scripture
[53:04] than that all right
[53:07] my sheep hear my voice
[53:11] a stranger they won't follow
[53:14] as in the marriage and divorce case the
[53:16] other day when the holy spirit had told
[53:18] me that
[53:18] i come said it just the way he told me
[53:21] some
[53:22] minister lady gave me a right sharpen
[53:23] the ball now she said
[53:25] i guess you take the place of god it's a
[53:28] no man
[53:28] that were you told her sin is forgiven
[53:30] the words that only god has power
[53:32] another pharisee
[53:39] that you might know that
[53:42] jesus told peter and the apostles
[53:46] actually had the revelation of who he
[53:48] was
[53:50] before he denied christ the son of god
[53:52] he said blessed are them
[53:53] the son of jonah flesh and blood never
[53:57] revealed this to you
[53:58] my father which is in heaven has
[54:00] revealed it upon this rock i'll build my
[54:02] church
[54:02] the gates of hell can't prevail against
[54:04] it and i give unto thee the keys
[54:09] whatever you find on earth i'll find it
[54:11] in here
[54:13] what you loose on earth that's that
[54:15] divine revelation
[54:16] of the word made flesh if it was
[54:19] flashing that day but the sun
[54:21] the groom is the flesh today by the
[54:23] bride
[54:26] whosoever sends your remit to them they
[54:29] are remitted
[54:31] whosoever sends you retain to them they
[54:33] are retained
[54:34] now the catholic church picks that up
[54:36] and takes it to the priest but that's
[54:38] carnal watch it was the spiritual
[54:42] revealed word that did it
[54:47] that's really going to go baptized in
[54:48] the name of father son holy course
[54:50] he knows they know who he was talking to
[54:53] a little preacher of the day he said to
[54:54] me he said now brother branham
[54:56] i've come out and joined one over to a
[54:58] certain
[54:59] uh certain church a pentecostal church
[55:02] where
[55:02] the pentecostal now has started taking
[55:04] the round wafer you know you've heard of
[55:06] that i guess
[55:07] the kosher the moon god you know and
[55:09] they all accepted it and statement
[55:10] this man said this congregation went
[55:13] through you said what i have blessed is
[55:14] blessed now you know what the priest
[55:15] says he has power to turn it back to the
[55:17] body of christ
[55:18] six to one half dozen others that's the
[55:20] same and um
[55:22] he said i want to ask you something he's
[55:24] trying to dodge that issue
[55:26] of the baptism jesus name because this
[55:28] was the man that said it was
[55:29] it was the antichrist that did that he
[55:31] said do you think it's all
[55:32] necessary that a man should be baptized
[55:35] in the name of jesus christ that's the
[55:36] gesture
[55:38] he said after he's been baptized in the
[55:39] name of father son holy ghost i said
[55:41] yesterday he has been baptized at all
[55:43] amen yes at all amen
[55:47] that's the title i said it doesn't
[55:49] recognize i said why
[55:51] did uh why did uh peter he said well let
[55:54] me tell you something
[55:55] he said now in acts 10 49 he said why
[55:58] peter had to speak these words the holy
[56:00] ghost telephone man but i said he
[56:01] turned right around and said can a man
[56:03] forbid water these should not be
[56:05] baptized
[56:07] he said when you're speaking over there
[56:08] a while ago about acts 19 where paul
[56:10] passed it up close to that's behind them
[56:12] disciples
[56:12] and said well said they wasn't baptized
[56:14] in the name of the father son holy ghost
[56:16] i said no they were baptized unto
[56:17] repentance not for remission of sin
[56:20] unto repentance because jesus had been
[56:22] made on you
[56:24] the sacrifice hadn't been killed he said
[56:25] well why would they have to be baptized
[56:27] or
[56:27] i said the man that had the key said
[56:29] this for be it knowing unto you that
[56:32] there's not another name under heaven
[56:34] given among man
[56:35] whereby you must be saved salvation
[56:38] alone goes in the name of jesus christ
[56:41] whatever you do in war or deeds do it
[56:43] all in the name of jesus christ
[56:45] there's not another name no church no
[56:47] heart you know
[56:48] titles or nothing else yet he is the
[56:50] rose of sharon lilly's valley morning
[56:52] star alpha omega beginning in
[56:53] jehovah character manasseh all these
[56:56] he's all these things but yet
[56:58] he there's not no salvation in any of
[57:00] those titles
[57:02] jehovah no salvation rose of sharon yet
[57:06] he is no salvation father son or holy
[57:08] ghost no salvation
[57:09] only the name of jesus christ and then
[57:12] the bible says
[57:13] that repentance and remission of
[57:17] sin must be taught in his name
[57:21] beginning at jerusalem and to the
[57:24] uttermost parts of the earth yeah
[57:26] he said do you think it makes any
[57:27] difference
[57:29] i said sir i want to ask you something
[57:32] he and i
[57:32] my wife were staying at the table he
[57:34] just moved over stimulus
[57:36] i said we are both arizonans we live
[57:39] here
[57:41] and i and we know our council and our
[57:43] award and
[57:44] all our mayor the governor and
[57:46] everything he said yes
[57:48] i said now if i told you brother to go
[57:51] over here and sign up for our dinner in
[57:54] the name
[57:54] of the governor of the state of arizona
[57:57] would you go sign it like that
[57:59] do you think they'd receive it as to
[58:00] death
[58:03] i guess not he said why did jesus say
[58:07] that after this is it
[58:09] see wow if i told you to go
[58:12] sign for this dinner in the name of the
[58:15] governor
[58:16] of the state of arizona and us being
[58:19] citizens of arizona
[58:21] and knowing who the governor is what you
[58:24] know to sign it in the name of sam
[58:26] goddard see i said because he is the
[58:28] governor of the state i don't have to
[58:29] question you
[58:30] you know who the governor is and he said
[58:33] father son and holy ghost he knows how
[58:34] to go to baptize they
[58:36] know who he was
[58:39] my sheep hear my voice
[58:43] he said oh i think but now the next
[58:47] thing
[58:47] what do you believe that heareth my word
[58:51] and believeth on him that sent me has
[58:54] everlasting time
[58:56] and when this new eternal life dwells in
[58:58] you
[58:59] it is the potential when you have
[59:02] received this holy spirit now that they
[59:03] did at pentecost
[59:05] they were the mechanics now the dynamics
[59:08] had to come
[59:08] they had believed you know our good
[59:11] baptist friends tells us when we believe
[59:13] we've got it
[59:14] but they didn't have it yet did believe
[59:16] acts 19 did believe but they didn't
[59:18] have you received the holy ghost
[59:19] sensually see they had the mechanics all
[59:22] right
[59:22] because the apostles were i mean uh
[59:24] apollos was teaching to them
[59:26] and proven by the bible the mechanics
[59:28] that jesus was the christ
[59:30] but they didn't have the dynamics yet
[59:33] that's it
[59:34] all right what spanish
[59:37] you potentially have the earnest
[59:41] the waiting now when you get the
[59:44] dynamics you
[59:45] have been quickened from mortal to
[59:47] immortality
[59:48] it makes the whole body come subject to
[59:50] the word
[59:52] it makes you act different look
[59:54] different live differently
[59:56] it'll just make you different hello
[1:00:00] quickened you who are once dead and sin
[1:00:03] and trespasses and darkness
[1:00:04] has he quickened what by his spirit
[1:00:07] that raised up jesus on easter morning
[1:00:09] from the dead and if it dwells
[1:00:11] in your mortal body now what is our soul
[1:00:14] quickens brings to life
[1:00:18] makes it subject to the word now how can
[1:00:21] you claim to have that spirit
[1:00:23] and throw yourself away from the word
[1:00:26] you're quickened by something else
[1:00:28] or it will freaking your mortal bodies
[1:00:30] to the word
[1:00:32] so it will you can't run without it you
[1:00:34] just splutter you don't believe all of
[1:00:35] it if you have pork gasoline part water
[1:00:38] you can't ain't going to go nowhere
[1:00:40] you've got to take it one hundred
[1:00:42] percent
[1:00:43] gasoline if you don't you're back for
[1:00:46] you ain't got no power
[1:00:48] well i'll buy bleed this or don't
[1:00:50] believe that don't
[1:00:52] you ain't going nowhere but oh when you
[1:00:55] take this
[1:00:58] let it light up on that every word is
[1:01:00] true
[1:01:02] then notice how as we close notice this
[1:01:05] notice
[1:01:06] it's just like a little a little seed
[1:01:09] laying in the ground
[1:01:10] now potentially you are resurrected
[1:01:14] you're resurrected when you receive the
[1:01:16] holy spirit in you
[1:01:18] you're resurrected right then your
[1:01:20] body's potentially
[1:01:21] resurrected look at a little steep plant
[1:01:24] in the ground
[1:01:25] it has to drink from its fountains the
[1:01:28] waters it pours down
[1:01:29] and as it drinks it pushes up towards
[1:01:31] him
[1:01:33] coming more like the likeness of the
[1:01:34] seed that went into the ground
[1:01:36] see the church come that way through
[1:01:38] justifications sanctification baptist
[1:01:40] and holy ghost now in the blossom
[1:01:42] see the spirit of god comes through that
[1:01:44] and the spirit of the world has come to
[1:01:46] the antichrist the same way and now
[1:01:47] blocks them out in a great union of
[1:01:49] churches
[1:01:50] see the whole thing and the individual
[1:01:52] comes that way
[1:01:53] everything works on the same on the same
[1:01:55] scale of god
[1:01:57] because he is saying yesterday forever
[1:02:01] notice on your way growing to the
[1:02:04] fullness of the resurrection
[1:02:06] led by the spirit as the sun f-u-n
[1:02:10] tool that little plant that's drinking
[1:02:12] from god's fountains
[1:02:13] just keep see he can only drink from one
[1:02:15] thing you pour
[1:02:16] oil down that little seed one time kill
[1:02:18] it
[1:02:20] that's right you pour stagnated water
[1:02:22] old water ain't no good's contaminated
[1:02:24] it'll stump the growth it won't bear
[1:02:27] fruit
[1:02:29] is that right but you pour real good
[1:02:32] soft rainforest
[1:02:34] hey no man-made chemicals in it
[1:02:38] just let it come from the heavens above
[1:02:39] and watch that little frame there's no
[1:02:41] water i'll grow that like that rainbow
[1:02:44] you put chlorine stuff in like you try
[1:02:45] to
[1:02:46] dose us up with and the first thing you
[1:02:48] know it kills the plane
[1:02:49] that's what's the matter today to try to
[1:02:50] give them water
[1:02:52] from the denominational fountain and it
[1:02:55] stunts the growth
[1:02:57] but lame has it were that dew drops of
[1:03:00] mercy all right
[1:03:03] day and by night jesus the light of the
[1:03:05] world and you've got it
[1:03:07] we'll walk in the light that beautiful
[1:03:09] light
[1:03:10] comes where the few drops of mercy are
[1:03:13] bright
[1:03:14] just shine all around me take these
[1:03:16] man-made fountains away from me
[1:03:17] all the thoughts i know nothing but the
[1:03:20] blood of jesus
[1:03:21] that's all the fountains i want to know
[1:03:23] that's the word dwelling me lord
[1:03:25] water it with our spirit now
[1:03:28] if that spirit that raised up jesus from
[1:03:31] the grave dwells in you
[1:03:32] you potentially have life led by the
[1:03:34] spirit
[1:03:35] to quicken the word to you to believe it
[1:03:37] the
[1:03:38] little thing keeps pushing up as it
[1:03:40] grows notice
[1:03:41] at pentecost their bodies were quickened
[1:03:44] to a new line look at a bunch of little
[1:03:47] cowards i'm holding fuel
[1:03:50] looking i'm just warmed up
[1:03:53] feeling good right oh my
[1:03:56] notice they were cowards
[1:03:59] notice but they had the mechanics
[1:04:03] but they were all standing back in their
[1:04:05] arms greater i'm afraid to go out and
[1:04:07] make a claim that goes oh
[1:04:08] all them great big bishops in the entire
[1:04:10] arab parade and preach the names i'm
[1:04:12] afraid to make that claim
[1:04:13] pray to us out and go oh i just can't do
[1:04:16] that you see
[1:04:16] but all of a sudden the dynamics come
[1:04:21] yes and what did it do didn't always
[1:04:25] fill their spirit inside but it
[1:04:27] quickened their mechanics
[1:04:31] their bodies were quicker they were no
[1:04:34] more cowards
[1:04:36] they went right out in the face of the
[1:04:37] people
[1:04:39] yes sir you man of judea than you to
[1:04:42] dwell in jerusalem
[1:04:43] or before the dynamics come they were
[1:04:45] just mechanics
[1:04:48] amen that dwell in jerusalem let this
[1:04:49] meat on you and harken my words these
[1:04:51] are not drunken
[1:04:52] supposed
[1:04:56] this is that i'll show you what it is
[1:04:58] it's the scripture
[1:04:59] this is that and i always say just think
[1:05:02] that let me keep this for that coming
[1:05:03] no this is that they were spoken over
[1:05:05] the prophet john will come to pass when
[1:05:07] i say it says god i'll pour out my
[1:05:08] spirit upon all places
[1:05:10] see the dynamics come into the mechanics
[1:05:13] it was afraid no more some of you people
[1:05:16] that are afraid that some woman will
[1:05:17] laugh at you
[1:05:18] for having their quit learning
[1:05:22] some of you man that's afraid your
[1:05:24] organization will throw you out when
[1:05:25] you're baptized your congregation is
[1:05:26] scriptural baptism
[1:05:29] you need to close yourself in the upper
[1:05:30] room till the dynamics come
[1:05:33] that's right it changed them it
[1:05:35] quickened them
[1:05:36] it made them different they were changed
[1:05:40] people
[1:05:40] from their own they quickened them from
[1:05:43] an old life of being a coward
[1:05:46] to a lack of the light of the tribe of
[1:05:48] jesus
[1:05:50] they absolutely face martyr nails or
[1:05:52] crosses crucified upside down
[1:05:54] first part of their lives now no more
[1:05:57] cars
[1:05:58] death had no victory over them at all
[1:06:01] the dynamics is in the mechanics
[1:06:03] yes sir it quickens their mortal body
[1:06:06] now listen
[1:06:07] here's another thing for fruit it's so
[1:06:09] quick in them
[1:06:11] in such a way do you know what they was
[1:06:12] lifted up in heavenly places
[1:06:14] and their mortal bodies were so quick
[1:06:16] until their language
[1:06:17] changed hallelujah they don't want to
[1:06:20] get quick in their language
[1:06:24] that's what the bible says their mortal
[1:06:27] bodies be
[1:06:28] quickened their language was quickened
[1:06:30] their thoughts were quicker
[1:06:32] their spirits were quickened they lied
[1:06:34] quicker
[1:06:35] they were quick and all together they
[1:06:38] tried to talk and couldn't talk in any
[1:06:40] more human languages
[1:06:41] they were so quick enough in the
[1:06:42] presence of god until they spoke in new
[1:06:44] tongues
[1:06:46] by every language
[1:06:49] if the spirit that raised up jesus from
[1:06:52] the dead dwells
[1:06:53] in you
[1:06:58] it will quicken your immortal bodies
[1:07:00] it'll make you do things you didn't do
[1:07:02] before
[1:07:03] but there's poor quickening power then

[1:07:42] above the power of genuine
[1:07:44] quicken eagles

[1:07:52] the grave
[1:07:52] dwelling in you as quick into your
[1:07:54] mortal body unto his presence you

[1:07:57] you are no longer a scavenger
[1:08:01] you're an eagle you don't want the
[1:08:03] things of the world
[1:08:04] you're the son daughter of god you're
[1:08:06] facing at a fountain that the world was
[1:08:08] nothing about
[1:08:09] you're drinking that somebody knows the
[1:08:11] world knows nothing about you you're
[1:08:12] eating hidden manna
[1:08:14] that the world never even knows nothing
[1:08:15] of it or you're an eagle you're quick
[1:08:17] enough where you can get to it you can't
[1:08:18] get through it down here you got to get
[1:08:20] up here
[1:08:20] you got to be quick and lifting up there
[1:08:22] so quickly
[1:08:23] hey what did they do they spoke in
[1:08:26] another language the bible said they
[1:08:28] didn't
[1:08:28] they spoke in every tongue under heaven
[1:08:30] could you imagine that
[1:08:32] an old mortal body that came out that
[1:08:34] well i don't
[1:08:35] know now whether i can believe this or
[1:08:37] not all at once they were so quick and
[1:08:40] so the bravery of the lion of the tribe
[1:08:42] of judah fellowship
[1:08:43] over that waving sheep oh
[1:08:46] that eagle come to call its own amen
[1:08:49] and they love not their lives unto them
[1:08:51] amen amen
[1:08:53] and there's going to be more who will
[1:08:55] give their life
[1:08:56] blood for this holy ghost gospel in its
[1:08:59] cleansing
[1:09:00] amen as the son of god be revealed again
[1:09:04] to the bride in the last days now
[1:09:06] quickly power's got to come
[1:09:08] a quick amount of these dead
[1:09:09] denominations increase to a visiting
[1:09:12] world of their living god
[1:09:14] oh no it's a new life
[1:09:18] it does the same thing for us now notice
[1:09:22] then they were so quick into that quick
[1:09:25] thing power
[1:09:26] uh listen close now i'm trying to show
[1:09:28] you the quickness power wasn't
[1:09:30] only in their soul but it was all over
[1:09:33] them
[1:09:36] and not only the dynamics come into
[1:09:38] quicken but it quickened the mechanics
[1:09:41] you see what i mean they were so quick
[1:09:43] until their tongues began to speak in
[1:09:45] another england
[1:09:47] they were so quickened by the power of
[1:09:49] the resurrection of christ
[1:09:51] until they laid their hands
[1:09:54] they were so quick and with quickening
[1:09:56] power and when they laid their hands up
[1:09:57] on the stick they got well
[1:10:00] quickened your mortal body man
[1:10:04] they were healed by laying on their
[1:10:05] hands and the spirit
[1:10:08] clicking their fellowships together with
[1:10:09] god so they
[1:10:11] also were so quick and into the presence
[1:10:13] of god until when a person died in their
[1:10:16] soul and girl they called him back to
[1:10:18] life
[1:10:18] again sorry
[1:10:22] i'm feeling religious that's right
[1:10:27] not only was his resurrection for
[1:10:29] himself
[1:10:30] but whosoever will
[1:10:34] through this predestinated seed that
[1:10:36] began their quickest
[1:10:38] christians are more about they lay hands
[1:10:40] on the sticks they recovered
[1:10:42] they prayed in the spirit of salvation
[1:10:44] call the dead back to life
[1:10:47] that's right right quicken their
[1:10:49] immortal body
[1:10:50] and if it comes into you if it be so
[1:10:54] now you can say it so but if it be so
[1:10:56] these signs follow them
[1:10:58] it quickens your mortal body it'll
[1:11:01] quicken you
[1:11:02] now notice put them into the presence of
[1:11:05] god
[1:11:05] why it was the spirit of god that raised
[1:11:08] up jesus from the grave
[1:11:09] and the spirit of god are given that
[1:11:11] eternal life comes from the greek word
[1:11:13] if you look up zoe
[1:11:14] which moves it through you
[1:11:17] and then quickens their even their mind
[1:11:23] hello how can you say that that spirit
[1:11:26] dwells
[1:11:27] in you though you've done
[1:11:30] everything that you thought was right
[1:11:32] here's your evidence when you got it now
[1:11:35] if the spirit that was in
[1:11:38] christ is in you it also
[1:11:42] quickens you to the word for he is the
[1:11:45] word
[1:11:46] and if it contrary quickens you away
[1:11:48] from the word
[1:11:49] then it isn't the spirit of christ
[1:11:52] sure what you've done until that moves
[1:11:55] you in the word
[1:11:56] my sheep hear my voice and they shall
[1:11:59] live by
[1:12:00] every word every word
[1:12:03] let's talk about the other day i
[1:12:06] love the word amen what is the wave
[1:12:09] sheath let's look at paragraph 87 on
[1:12:11] page 13.
[1:12:16] paragraph 87 will start there and read a
[1:12:19] little while
[1:12:21] it is not s-u-n anymore it is the
[1:12:23] s-o-n-d-a-y
[1:12:24] the sunday that that corn of wheat god's
[1:12:28] first one
[1:12:28] up from the dead is to be waved over the
[1:12:30] congregation
[1:12:31] that we are his seed and that's the
[1:12:34] first of the seed of those that slept
[1:12:36] waved upon the first day of the week on
[1:12:39] sunday he raised that wave goodbye and
[1:12:41] ascended up on high
[1:12:42] in the presence of the people notice it
[1:12:45] was the first corn of god's wheat that
[1:12:46] had been raised from the dead god's
[1:12:48] first corn of wheat
[1:12:50] by god's quickening power god had
[1:12:51] quickened his life
[1:12:53] raised him up from the dead and he was
[1:12:54] the first fruits of those that slept
[1:12:56] the firstfruits he was that sheaf that's
[1:12:59] why they have to wave that sheep for it
[1:13:01] was the first one that came to maturity
[1:13:03] and it was waived as a memorial of
[1:13:05] thanksgiving to god believing that the
[1:13:07] rest of them would come
[1:13:08] would come it was a sign and today
[1:13:11] because he was the first son of god to
[1:13:13] come to full maturity to be
[1:13:15] in god he was plucked up from the earth
[1:13:17] and has waved over the people
[1:13:19] and oh what a glorious lesson by the
[1:13:21] quickening power the first one
[1:13:23] although he had been typed in many times
[1:13:26] as we'll see later
[1:13:27] he was tight but this was really the
[1:13:29] first fruits of them that slept
[1:13:30] he was waved over the promised seed that
[1:13:33] had promise of life
[1:13:35] he was waved at the day of pentecost
[1:13:37] when they come a sound from heaven like
[1:13:39] a waving mighty rushing wind and
[1:13:41] was waved over the people the
[1:13:43] pentecostal people that was up at
[1:13:45] pentecost
[1:13:46] waiting for the blessing to come and to
[1:13:48] be waived again we realize in the last
[1:13:50] day according to luke 17
[1:13:52] 30 the the sunday again
[1:13:55] and the day that the s-o-n of man will
[1:13:58] be revealed or waved again
[1:14:00] over the people i'm going to stop right
[1:14:02] here for just a minute brother branham
[1:14:04] takes us
[1:14:05] to leviticus 23 and shows us the old
[1:14:07] testament law
[1:14:08] of gathering you know when they would
[1:14:10] come to a field the first part of the
[1:14:12] field that would come to maturity
[1:14:14] they would cut down a sheath from the
[1:14:16] first part of the seed that would come
[1:14:18] to full maturity
[1:14:19] and they would take it to the temple and
[1:14:21] not on the seventh day but on the first
[1:14:23] day of the week on the sunday
[1:14:24] amen they would begin to wave it amen
[1:14:27] and they wave it for your acceptance is
[1:14:29] what the scripture says
[1:14:30] showing that whatever brought this seed
[1:14:32] to full harvest maturity will bring the
[1:14:34] rest of the seed to full harvest
[1:14:36] maturity
[1:14:37] and so christ was the first one that
[1:14:39] came to full maturity
[1:14:41] to be in god to prove that he was the
[1:14:42] son of god to prove that he was seed
[1:14:44] and he was plucked up and waved over the
[1:14:46] people not on the seventh day but on the
[1:14:48] first day and then the first day of the
[1:14:50] week
[1:14:51] at the rising of the sun amen and he was
[1:14:53] waved over the people
[1:14:55] to show that that
[1:14:59] the same potential amen the same
[1:15:01] potential lays in the rest of the seed
[1:15:05] now let's start at the top of verse 14
[1:15:07] our
[1:15:08] page 14 again um paragraph 92
[1:15:12] and to be waived again so it was waved
[1:15:15] once and it was way
[1:15:16] back at the day of pentecost amen it was
[1:15:18] waived uh
[1:15:20] back again at the day of pentecost when
[1:15:21] the holy ghost came and was waved over
[1:15:23] the people
[1:15:24] and it quickened them to life and then
[1:15:26] brother branham says and it's to be
[1:15:27] waived again
[1:15:28] amen we realize in the last day
[1:15:30] according to luke 17
[1:15:32] 30 in the sunday again in the day that
[1:15:35] the s-o-n of man will be revealed are
[1:15:38] waved again
[1:15:39] over the people so now what was the wave
[1:15:41] sheath it was the first one to come to
[1:15:43] harvest maturity
[1:15:44] it was plucked up from the grave it was
[1:15:46] waved over the people the day of
[1:15:47] pentecost
[1:15:48] to show amen that they've been accepted
[1:15:51] and what brought him to full maturity
[1:15:52] will bring them the full maturity
[1:15:54] but brother branham said it's got to be
[1:15:56] waived again
[1:15:57] in the last days amen and the day
[1:16:00] what day the day that the esso of s o n
[1:16:03] of man the son of man will be revealed
[1:16:05] are waved again over the people so in
[1:16:08] luke 17 30
[1:16:09] amen in the revealing of the son of man
[1:16:11] what was the revealing of the son of man
[1:16:13] it was the waving of the wave sheath
[1:16:16] again in the last day over the people to
[1:16:19] show
[1:16:19] quickening power is here amen to bring
[1:16:22] you to life amen
[1:16:25] now who is the son of man in the
[1:16:28] beginning was the word he goes right
[1:16:30] back to john 1 1 who was the son of man
[1:16:32] it was the word amen in the beginning
[1:16:34] was the word and the word was with god
[1:16:36] and the word was god
[1:16:38] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:16:39] among us and if all the teaching that we
[1:16:42] have and confirmation of the word of god
[1:16:44] by word of god
[1:16:45] by signs by wonders we see today that in
[1:16:48] the book of luke here
[1:16:50] that we just quoted from luke the 17th
[1:16:52] chapter 30th verse
[1:16:53] and malachi 4 and the different
[1:16:55] scriptures that we are acquainted with
[1:16:57] that that word again is waved over the
[1:16:59] people that the dead traditions of man
[1:17:02] is dead and the son of god is alive
[1:17:05] again with the baptism of the holy
[1:17:07] spirit right among us
[1:17:08] and is giving us life as christ was the
[1:17:12] first one to raise from all the prophets
[1:17:13] and so forth
[1:17:14] although typed in many places he was the
[1:17:17] first fruits of those who slept
[1:17:18] in the bride coming of christ coming out
[1:17:21] of the church they'll have to be a sheaf
[1:17:23] waved again in the last days oh my what
[1:17:26] was that sheep
[1:17:27] that was the waving of the sheep it was
[1:17:28] luke 17 30 the revealing of the son of
[1:17:31] man was the waving of the sheep
[1:17:33] and it was waved again in the last days
[1:17:35] it was it was waved in his day
[1:17:37] amen to bring him out of the dead
[1:17:39] traditions of their fathers where they
[1:17:41] had taken the law and converted into
[1:17:42] their own understanding
[1:17:44] to bring them out of that into the
[1:17:45] reality of the living word and is to do
[1:17:47] the same thing again in this day
[1:17:51] the bride coming of christ coming out of
[1:17:52] the church don't have to be a sheaf
[1:17:54] waved again in the last days oh my
[1:17:56] waving of the sheep what was the sheaf
[1:17:59] the first one that come to mature the
[1:18:02] first one that proved it was a wheat
[1:18:04] that proved it was a sheaf hallelujah
[1:18:06] i'm sure you see what i'm talking about
[1:18:09] it was waved over the people and the
[1:18:11] first time that will come forth for the
[1:18:13] bright age
[1:18:14] for a resurrection out of dark
[1:18:16] denominationalism will be a message
[1:18:18] that the full maturity of the word is
[1:18:20] turned back again in its full power
[1:18:22] and being waved over the people by the
[1:18:24] same signs and wonders that he did
[1:18:26] back then show me where
[1:18:30] through this prophet god didn't do the
[1:18:31] same thing amen through this prophet he
[1:18:34] showed the sa
[1:18:34] he revealed the son of man through the
[1:18:36] prophet he did the same signs and
[1:18:38] wonders
[1:18:38] through the prophet he restored back the
[1:18:40] word and it was waving the wave sheath
[1:18:42] over the people again

[1:18:50] ye live also speaking to his wife
[1:18:51] because i live ye live also what a
[1:18:54] resurrection that was
[1:18:56] and what a resurrection this is
[1:18:59] because it is the rising of the sun not
[1:19:02] was or will be but it is a rising of a
[1:19:04] sun

[1:19:07] but what erection
[1:19:08] resurrection this is in this day friends
[1:19:12] to be quickened from the dead to be made
[1:19:14] alive in christ jesus by god's
[1:19:15] quickening power
[1:19:17] he was waved to them the word which he
[1:19:20] was was weighed back to them on the day
[1:19:22] of pentecost
[1:19:23] the word made manifest
[1:19:26] now when i say it's to be waved again in
[1:19:29] the last days
[1:19:31] he was the word being waved amen it was
[1:19:33] the son of man being waved the word made
[1:19:35] manifest being waived
[1:19:37] and on our day it was waved again amen
[1:19:40] the first one that come to maturity to
[1:19:42] prove it was a weed
[1:19:43] and brother banham was standing here a
[1:19:45] son of man revealing the son of man but
[1:19:47] these son of man was working through
[1:19:49] that son of man

[1:20:17] been accepted amen and you're coming to
[1:20:19] the same maturity

[1:20:39] rest of the field is secure
[1:20:41] the rest of the field will come to full
[1:20:43] harvest maturity
[1:20:44] i don't have to worry amen i don't have
[1:20:47] to stress
[1:20:48] i don't have to strain because there was
[1:20:50] a wave sheet because
[1:20:51] that part of the word come to
[1:20:53] manifestation and was waved over the
[1:20:55] congregation
[1:20:56] it has secured the process for the rest
[1:20:58] of the field
[1:20:59] the rest of the field will come to full
[1:21:01] harvest maturity
[1:21:03] it has been waived for my acceptance
[1:21:05] amen i don't have to prove anything i
[1:21:07] don't have to strain
[1:21:08] all i have to do is lay in the presence
[1:21:10] of the sun to break all the greenness
[1:21:12] out
[1:21:12] amen will come to the same harvest
[1:21:14] maturity
[1:21:16] you may not have to do all the same
[1:21:18] things that brother branham did that's
[1:21:19] not what i'm talking about
[1:21:20] but the same life amen the same
[1:21:23] resurrected life
[1:21:24] has to be in you and i
[1:21:29] it's been waived for our acceptance
[1:21:33] let's turn over to page
[1:21:36] 21 no i'm sorry 20.
[1:21:40] top of page 20 paragraph 141
[1:21:45] and god knows
[1:21:51] and god knows he's got a predestinated
[1:21:54] for ordained church he
[1:21:55] knowed he's got sons and daughters and a
[1:21:57] bride waiting somewhere
[1:21:59] when the holy spirit begins to fly over
[1:22:01] it the wave sheath
[1:22:04] oh my he's the same yesterday today and
[1:22:06] forever
[1:22:07] not some mythical story but a reality
[1:22:11] so what is the wave sheath it's the son
[1:22:13] of man
[1:22:15] it's the holy spirit it's the life of
[1:22:18] god
[1:22:19] it's the life of christ it's all the
[1:22:21] same thing being waved
[1:22:23] back over the people again and that's
[1:22:26] the wave chief
[1:22:28] hallelujah let's look at question number
[1:22:31] two
[1:22:33] what are the mechanics and the dynamics
[1:22:37] let's go to page 15.
[1:22:47] page 15.
[1:22:50] let's look at paragraph 102.
[1:22:55] well you say the power is in the
[1:22:56] gasoline brother venom but i don't care
[1:22:59] how much power is in the gasoline unless
[1:23:01] there's a spark there to manifest that
[1:23:03] power
[1:23:03] unless there's a power there to confirm
[1:23:05] that that's gasoline
[1:23:07] it might as well be water no matter how
[1:23:10] much theologians claim how well you get
[1:23:12] your church set how much
[1:23:13] education you got how much like the
[1:23:15] bible until that wave sheaf until the
[1:23:17] holy spirit
[1:23:18] comes upon that person to quicken that
[1:23:20] word
[1:23:21] that gasoline represents the word it's
[1:23:24] the truth but without the spirit it
[1:23:26] won't move
[1:23:28] we have too much we have we have put too
[1:23:30] much stress on the mechanics and nothing
[1:23:32] on the dynamics
[1:23:33] it needs the dynamic power of god the
[1:23:35] resurrection power of jesus christ upon
[1:23:37] the church
[1:23:38] to manifest and to bring to pass that
[1:23:40] this is gasoline
[1:23:42] it might be in a gasoline can it could
[1:23:44] still be water see
[1:23:45] but the only proof of it is proof of it
[1:23:48] is put
[1:23:48] this life on it and it'll prove whether
[1:23:51] it's gasoline or not
[1:23:53] so the the the mechanics brother bannon
[1:23:56] is showing
[1:23:57] is the word amen the mechanics is the
[1:23:59] word amen but the
[1:24:01] he says the dynamics is the holy spirit
[1:24:04] is the life
[1:24:05] let's turn over to paragraph 113
[1:24:08] on the next page and i want to read
[1:24:12] in this paragraph 113 i want to read the
[1:24:13] last two sentences
[1:24:15] he said that's the easter that's the
[1:24:17] easter message
[1:24:19] the dynamics and the mechanics together
[1:24:21] both the word
[1:24:22] and the life that's this easter message
[1:24:25] the
[1:24:26] dynamics and the mechanics together the
[1:24:28] mechanics without the
[1:24:29] dynamics no good neither is the dynamics
[1:24:32] without the mechanics
[1:24:34] that's an interesting statement it takes
[1:24:36] both next page paragraph 116.
[1:24:42] it just won't move no matter how good
[1:24:43] the mechanics is until the dynamics come
[1:24:46] when the dynamics come that fire is made
[1:24:49] to connect with that octane and the
[1:24:50] gasoline
[1:24:51] and when that explodes it causes a
[1:24:53] combustion and that combustion moves
[1:24:55] every motion every move for he is the
[1:24:57] same yesterday today and forever
[1:24:59] that's the resurrection that's the real
[1:25:01] power of god
[1:25:02] mechanics with dynamics notice it's the
[1:25:05] spirit that quickened it it's the spark
[1:25:07] that fires
[1:25:08] it's not the gas that fires it's the
[1:25:10] spark that fires the gas see
[1:25:12] you can do nothing without me but with
[1:25:14] me you can do all things as he is the
[1:25:16] word
[1:25:16] it's the father living father sent me so
[1:25:19] send i you
[1:25:20] as the father has fired me and pushed me
[1:25:22] into everything
[1:25:23] i do only that which pleases to god is
[1:25:25] pleasing to god
[1:25:26] now as he sent me so what send i you
[1:25:29] with the same mechanics
[1:25:30] and it takes the same dynamics to
[1:25:32] operate in and these signs shall follow
[1:25:35] them that claim to have the mechanics
[1:25:37] the dynamics will take its place so
[1:25:40] the mechanics is the word and the
[1:25:42] dynamics is the spark
[1:25:44] amen that so brother bram takes it with
[1:25:45] gasoline and spark in this engine in
[1:25:47] this cadillac
[1:25:48] said the cadillac is perfect it's set in
[1:25:50] motion he said we have two cadillacs
[1:25:51] here
[1:25:52] and everything set and then perfect amen
[1:25:54] and he says but one
[1:25:56] has got the spark and the other one has
[1:25:58] no spark and the one with the spark can
[1:26:00] get on down the road
[1:26:01] and he types the mechanics and the
[1:26:03] dynamics with gasoline
[1:26:05] and spark and he types it with the word
[1:26:07] and the life
[1:26:09] so it takes the word and the life
[1:26:10] together and he said this is the easter
[1:26:12] message
[1:26:13] the eastern messages the dynamics and
[1:26:15] the mechanics together
[1:26:17] it's the word and it's the life amen
[1:26:20] it's the word that's been restored and
[1:26:21] it's the life that's come back into the
[1:26:23] church
[1:26:25] question number three
[1:26:30] how is this mortal flesh going to become
[1:26:33] his flesh
[1:26:35] this is really good let's go to
[1:26:37] paragraph 123
[1:26:40] on page 18.
[1:26:45] how is this mortal flesh going to become
[1:26:47] his flesh
[1:26:50] so the bride must also be flesh of his
[1:26:52] flesh and bone of his bone
[1:26:55] then how is this mortal flesh going to
[1:26:57] become his flesh
[1:26:58] we'll get to it in a minute see how it's
[1:27:01] how
[1:27:02] how is it done how what is this great
[1:27:05] transformation notice
[1:27:06] now if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:27:08] jesus from the dead dwell in you
[1:27:10] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:27:12] shall also quicken your mortal bodies
[1:27:14] by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:27:17] now oftentimes when we read that
[1:27:19] scripture and many times in the past
[1:27:21] we've read the scripture with a
[1:27:22] denominational understanding
[1:27:25] and we look at this scripture as future
[1:27:28] tense that says if the spirit of him
[1:27:31] that raised up jesus from the dead dwell
[1:27:32] on you he that raised up christ from the
[1:27:34] dead shall also quicken your mortal
[1:27:36] bodies
[1:27:36] by a spirit that dwelleth in you and we
[1:27:39] look at it as a
[1:27:40] future resurrection body change
[1:27:42] scripture
[1:27:43] but brother branham is going to use it
[1:27:45] as a present tense
[1:27:46] scripture that the spirit in you will
[1:27:49] quicken your mortal body
[1:27:51] by the spirit that dwelleth in you that
[1:27:53] your mortal body is going to be
[1:27:55] quickened amen
[1:27:56] even before the change in the body even
[1:27:59] before your atoms change there's going
[1:28:00] to be a quickening of your mortal flesh
[1:28:03] so the denominational understanding is
[1:28:06] if you have the spirit of god
[1:28:07] someday your body will change in the
[1:28:09] rapture and resurrection but brother
[1:28:10] branham is bringing it right
[1:28:12] present tense amen that is a truth but
[1:28:14] it's also true that that spirit is
[1:28:15] changing us now
[1:28:20] let's turn to let's look at paragraph
[1:28:23] 141 on the next page page 20.
[1:28:28] this is one of those where brother
[1:28:29] branham asks a question and he makes a
[1:28:31] statement
[1:28:32] then he says other things and he gets
[1:28:33] back to it he says other things and he
[1:28:34] gets back to it
[1:28:35] and you got to follow brother branham
[1:28:37] through because he asked the question
[1:28:39] he said how is this mortal flesh going
[1:28:40] to become his flesh how is it done
[1:28:43] what is this great transformation in
[1:28:45] paragraph 141 he says and god knows
[1:28:47] hallelujah he's got a predestinated
[1:28:50] foreordained church
[1:28:51] he knowed he's got sons and daughters
[1:28:53] and a bride waiting somewhere
[1:28:55] when the holy spirit begins to fly over
[1:28:57] it that wave sheave
[1:29:00] oh my he's the same yesterday today and
[1:29:02] forever
[1:29:03] not some mythical story but a reality
[1:29:06] no matter how many tried to tell him an
[1:29:08] eagle he didn't know what an eagle was
[1:29:11] yet he was an eagle oh i want to stop
[1:29:13] right there brother branham's keying in
[1:29:15] on if his story
[1:29:16] of the farmer taking an egg out of the
[1:29:18] eagle's nest and putting it under a hand
[1:29:20] and the eagle being born in the barnyard
[1:29:22] under a hand
[1:29:23] amen and confused about its identity
[1:29:25] thinking it's a chicken identifying as a
[1:29:27] chicken
[1:29:28] but all the time being an eagle and
[1:29:30] brother ben is going to take that story
[1:29:31] and he's going to begin to show us and
[1:29:33] listen through this eagle story
[1:29:35] he's going to begin to show us the
[1:29:37] quickening power and a resurrection
[1:29:40] and the same quickening power and
[1:29:42] resurrection that's available for us
[1:29:44] today
[1:29:46] he says now when that holy spirit begins
[1:29:49] to fly over that wave sheaf
[1:29:51] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:29:52] forever he said no matter how many tried
[1:29:55] to tell him an eagle he didn't know what
[1:29:57] an eagle was
[1:29:58] no matter how many times he was a
[1:30:00] christian wanted to be a christian
[1:30:01] amen you didn't even know what a
[1:30:03] christian was until you saw the prophet
[1:30:05] of god in action
[1:30:06] god working through that one then you
[1:30:08] knew what a son of god was
[1:30:12] amen no matter how many tried to tell
[1:30:14] him an ego he didn't know what an eagle
[1:30:16] was yet he was an eagle
[1:30:18] he would not understand it until he seen
[1:30:20] something that reflected him
[1:30:22] that he reflected rather and when he
[1:30:24] seen not a denomination
[1:30:26] not a phd not an lld not a good neighbor
[1:30:30] but a son of god molded in the image of
[1:30:32] god with the dynamic power of god to
[1:30:34] answer the request of this day
[1:30:37] look what brother branham is saying he's
[1:30:39] not talking about i mean the day that
[1:30:41] jesus of nazareth is here he's talking
[1:30:43] about today
[1:30:44] there had to be an eagle flying in this
[1:30:46] day for us to look at
[1:30:48] we didn't even know what a manifested
[1:30:50] son of god it was we didn't even know
[1:30:51] what a mature son of god was
[1:30:53] until we saw one and then we know
[1:30:55] whatever that is is what i
[1:30:56] am
[1:31:00] amen i'm going to read that again but a
[1:31:02] son of god
[1:31:03] molded in the image of god with the
[1:31:05] dynamic power of god to answer the
[1:31:07] request of this day
[1:31:09] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:31:11] forever there ain't no him
[1:31:13] going to hold you he hunts for his mama
[1:31:15] he's an eagle to begin with
[1:31:17] he recognizes this real eagle recognizes
[1:31:19] the call of god's word
[1:31:21] why he's an eagle a eagle to an
[1:31:24] eagle the word before the foundation the
[1:31:27] word to the word
[1:31:28] the word predestinated to the word
[1:31:31] written for the hour
[1:31:32] you realize your position
[1:31:36] he hunts for it what did the eagle
[1:31:39] realize the eagle realized that it's not
[1:31:41] an
[1:31:42] earth-bound bird but it's a heaven-bound
[1:31:44] bird and it recognizes his position and
[1:31:46] leaves the denomination leaves the
[1:31:49] church leaves the barnyard
[1:31:51] and takes his position in the heavenlies
[1:31:53] and you and i realize
[1:31:54] amen when we heard this eagle screen
[1:31:56] this holy ghost that was moving in our
[1:31:58] day
[1:31:59] amen we saw it manifest through a life
[1:32:01] amen with
[1:32:02] with all the signs and all the wonders
[1:32:04] and the restoration of the word
[1:32:06] when we saw that amen we recognize
[1:32:09] that's
[1:32:09] my position amen the ego was looking up
[1:32:12] to its position
[1:32:13] and we in our day have been looking up
[1:32:15] we're not supposed to be earthbound
[1:32:17] we're not supposed to be
[1:32:18] denominationally minded we're not
[1:32:19] supposed to live a chicken life
[1:32:22] but our position is up there
[1:32:25] you realize your position he hunts for
[1:32:27] it
[1:32:28] this then this earthly body
[1:32:31] is quickened and brought by the
[1:32:34] quickening spirit of god
[1:32:36] to obedience to the word of god
[1:32:40] amen brother ben's talking about today
[1:32:43] it is the rising of the sun
[1:32:48] paragraph 147 the word to the word
[1:32:52] the works that i do show you also he
[1:32:54] that believeth in me the works that i do
[1:32:56] shall he
[1:32:57] also see because i live he lives also
[1:33:00] and if the spirit that raised him from
[1:33:01] the dead dwells in you it quickens your
[1:33:03] mortal body see
[1:33:05] what does it do now listen so that
[1:33:07] you'll know this easter i want it to
[1:33:09] mean more
[1:33:10] to you than any easter ever did see i
[1:33:13] want you to see it
[1:33:14] we know what it did for him but i want
[1:33:16] you
[1:33:17] i want you to see it not will it
[1:33:20] has done the same for you what does it
[1:33:23] do it quickens the mortal body this
[1:33:25] mortal body that we live in
[1:33:27] it quickens it in other words it brings
[1:33:30] it to life
[1:33:31] now you who once walked along with a
[1:33:33] great big cigar in your mouth and
[1:33:35] everything or a bunch of cigarettes
[1:33:36] and you women who once had short hair
[1:33:38] painted and carried on and
[1:33:40] wore shorts and things like that all at
[1:33:42] once something screamed
[1:33:43] and you looked down and here it was the
[1:33:45] word see
[1:33:46] it quickened your you said no more
[1:33:48] shorts for me no more liquor for me
[1:33:51] no more lying no more stealing no more
[1:33:53] this that see
[1:33:54] the spirit that raised him from the dead
[1:33:56] dwelling in you will
[1:33:57] also bring your mortal bodies the dust
[1:34:00] of the earth
[1:34:00] into subjection you see
[1:34:04] what it is subjection to what christ who
[1:34:06] is christ the word
[1:34:08] not the theology but the word then you
[1:34:10] say
[1:34:11] that these things oh i think it's all
[1:34:13] right for women to wear slacks
[1:34:15] when the word says no see it quickens
[1:34:17] you to that
[1:34:18] see you are drawn to it see it becomes
[1:34:21] you become part of the word
[1:34:23] it brings your body skip down to
[1:34:25] paragraph 154
[1:34:27] but brother when you hear that scream
[1:34:29] there's something in you you're an eagle
[1:34:31] to begin with why
[1:34:33] you are that seed now you want i want
[1:34:36] you to see
[1:34:37] all the way through this message brother
[1:34:38] branham is referring to the seed
[1:34:40] singular not seeds plural
[1:34:43] he is never referring to it plural
[1:34:45] because in the bible it was abraham's
[1:34:47] seed singular not plural and what is
[1:34:49] abraham's seed abraham's seed is christ
[1:34:53] and you are part of that seed singular
[1:34:56] christ
[1:34:57] you're part of it it's part of a many
[1:34:58] member body but it's the life of christ
[1:35:01] you are that seed that resurrection of
[1:35:03] the s-o-n
[1:35:04] has dawned and the wave sheep upon the
[1:35:07] earth to make you recognize
[1:35:09] that you are an eagle and not a
[1:35:11] denominational chick and you see it and
[1:35:14] if the
[1:35:14] if the spirit that raised him from the
[1:35:16] dead the word the dynamic of the word
[1:35:18] dwells in you
[1:35:20] it also quickens your mortal body now
[1:35:22] how
[1:35:23] we flesh of his flesh and bone of his
[1:35:25] bone he asked the question again
[1:35:27] now how we flesh of his flesh and bone
[1:35:29] of his bone
[1:35:30] because quickly while we were yet
[1:35:32] sinners mortal ready to die
[1:35:34] these bodies it quickens that body
[1:35:37] what's quicken
[1:35:38] brings to life the spirit that once
[1:35:41] liked to drink run around
[1:35:42] commit adultery and all these it
[1:35:44] quickened why
[1:35:45] the thing died and you are resurrected
[1:35:48] it quickens your
[1:35:49] mortal body therefore your bodies is the
[1:35:52] temple of the dynamics
[1:35:54] because why from the beginning you are
[1:35:56] part of the mechanics
[1:35:57] because you're part of that seed amen
[1:35:59] you're part of christ you're part of the
[1:36:01] word
[1:36:01] and because you're part of that amen you
[1:36:04] are a temple of the dynamics
[1:36:07] oh there is your
[1:36:10] resurrection there is the church
[1:36:14] in the resurrection with him these
[1:36:17] bodies right now
[1:36:19] are quick and see you've heard you
[1:36:21] believed
[1:36:22] it changed you from a denomination to
[1:36:24] the word
[1:36:26] when brother branham is preaching this
[1:36:28] scripture amen out of romans 8 11 he is
[1:36:31] preaching it
[1:36:32] present tense potential to quicken your
[1:36:34] mortal bodies to bring
[1:36:36] this body subject to the word this body
[1:36:39] in obedience to the word
[1:36:40] that this body must now reflect the life
[1:36:44] that's come inside because the dynamic
[1:36:45] power has come inside
[1:36:47] to quicken the word and now it's to be
[1:36:48] manifest on the outside
[1:36:50] not just something that takes place on
[1:36:52] the inside but what takes place on the
[1:36:54] inside
[1:36:54] has to be brought to life on the outside
[1:36:57] so this power has to quicken your mortal
[1:36:59] body
[1:36:59] so that this body can demonstrate the
[1:37:01] life that's on the inside
[1:37:05] amen
[1:37:08] praise be to god
[1:37:11] god is good let's look at
[1:37:15] turn the page over to paragraph 191
[1:37:18] the bottom of page 25.
[1:37:24] now when you get the dynamics you have
[1:37:27] been quickened from mortal to
[1:37:28] immortality
[1:37:30] it makes the whole body come subject to
[1:37:32] the word it'll make you act different
[1:37:35] look different live different it'll just
[1:37:37] make you different
[1:37:39] now look ben quickened you who were once
[1:37:42] dead in sin and trespasses in darkness
[1:37:44] as he quickened what by his spirit that
[1:37:47] raised up jesus on easter morning from
[1:37:49] the dead
[1:37:50] and if it dwells in your mortal bodies
[1:37:52] now watch it also
[1:37:53] quickens brings to life makes it subject
[1:37:56] to the word
[1:37:57] now how can you claim to have that
[1:37:59] spirit and throw yourself away from the
[1:38:01] word
[1:38:01] you're quickened by something else for
[1:38:03] it will quicken your mortal bodies
[1:38:05] to the word it sure will
[1:38:09] brother branham is preaching a present
[1:38:11] tense
[1:38:12] resurrection he's preaching a present
[1:38:15] tense
[1:38:16] easter he's saying it is the rising
[1:38:20] of the sun and that rising of the sun
[1:38:24] is quickening seeds that have life
[1:38:26] inside of them it's quickening them to
[1:38:28] life
[1:38:28] to bring them into a manifestation that
[1:38:31] that
[1:38:32] no way defeats the truth or or obscures
[1:38:35] the truth that
[1:38:36] one day these bodies will change our
[1:38:38] atoms will change
[1:38:39] absolutely but it's changing now
[1:38:43] amen the the body is coming subject to
[1:38:46] the life on inside and it's raining in
[1:38:48] the cravings it's raining in the desire
[1:38:50] it's changing the cravings changing the
[1:38:51] desires changing the actions
[1:38:53] changing the reactions amen bringing it
[1:38:55] light it's changing now
[1:38:58] and it will be ultimately changed when
[1:39:01] our atoms change
[1:39:03] praise god let's go to question number
[1:39:06] four
[1:39:08] to go here i'd like to take our bibles
[1:39:10] before we read this
[1:39:11] and let's read in matthew 16.
[1:39:15] brother branham's going to quote these
[1:39:17] just off hand
[1:39:19] in the sermon here but i'd like to read
[1:39:21] matthew 16
[1:39:24] verse 17.
[1:39:30] and jesus answered and said unto him
[1:39:32] blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh
[1:39:34] and blood hath not revealed it unto thee
[1:39:37] but my father which is in heaven so
[1:39:39] peter just got the revelation of who
[1:39:42] christ is
[1:39:43] and he said it wasn't anything any man
[1:39:46] gave you it was a direct revelation from
[1:39:48] the father
[1:39:49] so that's what he just stated in verse
[1:39:50] 18 and i say unto thee
[1:39:52] that thou art peter and upon this rock i
[1:39:54] will build my church
[1:39:55] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:39:58] against it
[1:39:59] verse 19 and i will give unto thee the
[1:40:01] keys of the kingdom of heaven
[1:40:03] and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[1:40:05] shall be bound in heaven
[1:40:06] and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[1:40:08] shall be loosed in heaven
[1:40:10] let's go over to john 20.
[1:40:16] john chapter 20.
[1:40:24] and verse 21
[1:40:31] first william then said jesus to them
[1:40:33] again peace be unto you as my father has
[1:40:35] sent me
[1:40:36] even so send i you and when he had said
[1:40:39] this he breathed on them and saith unto
[1:40:41] them receive ye the holy ghost
[1:40:44] whosoever sins you remit they are
[1:40:47] remitted unto them
[1:40:48] and whosoever sins you retain they are
[1:40:51] retained
[1:40:53] the question that i asked for question
[1:40:54] number four was how were sins remitted
[1:40:57] by the apostles and it was based off
[1:40:59] these scriptures
[1:41:01] let's go to paragraph 163 at the bottom
[1:41:03] of page 22.
[1:41:13] paragraph 163
[1:41:17] as in the marriage and divorce case the
[1:41:18] other day when the holy spirit had told
[1:41:20] me
[1:41:21] that i come said it just the way he told
[1:41:23] me
[1:41:25] and some minister lady gave me a right
[1:41:26] sharp balling out what brother ben is
[1:41:28] referring to
[1:41:29] his brother branham is referring to the
[1:41:30] lord told him that the people were
[1:41:32] caught
[1:41:33] up in wrong marriages through marriage
[1:41:34] and divorce and by wrong teaching
[1:41:36] they were caught in these situations and
[1:41:39] brother brenham was told
[1:41:40] that he could permit them to go on as
[1:41:42] they were that they were forgiven
[1:41:44] and that they could go on as they were
[1:41:46] but don't ever do it again
[1:41:47] right that's what he's referring to it
[1:41:50] says here and some minister lady gave me
[1:41:51] a right sharp little balling out she
[1:41:53] said i guess you take the place of god
[1:41:56] i said no ma'am said well you told them
[1:41:58] their sins is forgiven said
[1:42:00] where said only god has power see
[1:42:03] another pharisee.
[1:42:05] i said you see that you might know that
[1:42:07] jesus told peter and the apostles after
[1:42:09] he had
[1:42:09] the revelation of who he was he told him
[1:42:12] thou art christ the son of god
[1:42:14] he said blessed art thou see son of
[1:42:16] jonas flesh and blood never revealed
[1:42:18] this to you but my father which is in
[1:42:19] heaven
[1:42:20] has revealed it upon this rock i'll
[1:42:21] build my church and the gates of hell
[1:42:23] can't prevail against it
[1:42:24] and i give unto thee the keys whatever
[1:42:27] you bind on earth i'll bind in heaven
[1:42:29] what you loose on earth
[1:42:30] that's that's that divine revelation of
[1:42:34] the word
[1:42:34] made flesh if it was flesh in the day by
[1:42:37] the sun the groom it is flesh today by
[1:42:40] the bride see
[1:42:41] whosoever sends you remit to them they
[1:42:43] are remitted whosoever sins you retain
[1:42:45] to them they are retained
[1:42:47] now the catholic church picked that up
[1:42:49] and takes it to their priest
[1:42:51] but that's carnal they'll go and make a
[1:42:54] confession in a confession booth to a
[1:42:56] priest and the
[1:42:57] priest will say no you're forgiven but
[1:42:59] that's carnal that's not even what this
[1:43:01] is talking about
[1:43:05] paragraph 170 watch it was the spiritual
[1:43:08] revealed word that did it
[1:43:11] that's the reason he told them to go
[1:43:14] baptized in the name of father son holy
[1:43:16] ghost
[1:43:16] he knowed they knowed who he was look
[1:43:20] how brother benham tied this thing
[1:43:21] together
[1:43:22] he's saying now now he got a right sharp
[1:43:25] balling out from a woman because of what
[1:43:26] he had said but brother brandon prefaced
[1:43:28] what he said was this is only
[1:43:30] to my people only to those that are
[1:43:32] staying with this word and
[1:43:34] on this word the ones who are believing
[1:43:37] the manifested revealed word for the day
[1:43:39] the ones who have accepted christ amen
[1:43:41] the ones who have
[1:43:42] got who've accepted amen the word made
[1:43:44] flesh
[1:43:45] he said it's only for those people so
[1:43:47] brother ben preface that
[1:43:49] he comes down and he says now he told
[1:43:51] peter whatsoever you bind i'll buy what
[1:43:53] you loose i'll lose
[1:43:54] amen that's the divine revelation of the
[1:43:56] word made flesh
[1:43:57] and he goes on to say whosoever sends
[1:44:00] your remit to them to remit whoever
[1:44:02] sends you retain to them to retain
[1:44:04] and he says not like the catholics where
[1:44:06] the catholic priest says you're forgiven
[1:44:07] and you're not
[1:44:08] and you confess it to me no he says
[1:44:10] watch it's the spiritual revealed word
[1:44:12] that did it that's why he told him to
[1:44:14] baptize that way
[1:44:18] what he's showing
[1:44:21] that the revelation of who the father
[1:44:24] son and holy ghost was he told him to
[1:44:26] baptize that way
[1:44:27] because he knew that they caught the
[1:44:28] revelation of who he was
[1:44:30] and would come preaching the right
[1:44:31] baptism and when the right baptism would
[1:44:33] only be accepted by the eagles and when
[1:44:35] it was accepted by the eagles
[1:44:37] when they accepted the word for their
[1:44:39] day their sins would be remitted
[1:44:42] it wasn't a hocus pocus or casting a
[1:44:45] spell or an incantation or
[1:44:47] you said this and i say this and you're
[1:44:49] forgiven because of this
[1:44:50] no they just gave the revelation of the
[1:44:52] word for their day
[1:44:53] what must we do to be saved repent amen
[1:44:55] and be baptized in the name of the lord
[1:44:57] jesus and you shall receive the gift of
[1:44:58] the holy ghost
[1:44:59] and they accepted it they believed it
[1:45:01] and then they repented they were
[1:45:02] baptized and they were filled with the
[1:45:03] holy ghost and their sins were
[1:45:05] remembered
[1:45:07] that's how the apostles remitted sin
[1:45:10] by giving the revealed word for their
[1:45:12] day and when it was accepted and acted
[1:45:15] upon the sins were remitted
[1:45:17] how is the sins remitted in this day the
[1:45:20] exact same way it's no different
[1:45:22] the revealed word of the hour is given
[1:45:23] out amen it's accepted by faith and
[1:45:26] acted upon
[1:45:27] amen and the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:45:29] comes and the sin is washed away
[1:45:33] amen there's nothing different it's the
[1:45:36] same process
[1:45:38] praise be to god now i want to make one
[1:45:42] last note
[1:45:43] before we close paragraph 231
[1:45:47] let's go all the way to page 30.
[1:45:52] i thought this was an outstanding
[1:45:53] statement
[1:45:55] so the last thing that he said before we
[1:45:57] turn the tape off
[1:46:00] paragraph 231 now look
[1:46:03] how can you say that the spirit dwells
[1:46:05] in you how can you say that
[1:46:09] though you've done everything that you
[1:46:10] thought was right here's your evidence
[1:46:12] whether you've got it or not
[1:46:14] if the spirit that was in christ is in
[1:46:16] you it also quickens you to the word
[1:46:21] for he is the word and if it
[1:46:24] if it contrary quickens you away from
[1:46:26] the word then it isn't the spirit of
[1:46:28] christ
[1:46:28] i care what you've done until that moves
[1:46:31] you in the word
[1:46:32] my sheep hear my voice and they shall
[1:46:34] live by every word
[1:46:36] every word i was talking on that the
[1:46:38] other day
[1:46:40] what's the evidence that spirit in you
[1:46:43] doesn't move your contrary the word it
[1:46:44] moves you right into the word
[1:46:47] to accept every word to believe every
[1:46:49] word to manifest every word
[1:46:51] to live it amen to believe it
[1:46:54] to live it to manifesting oh god is good
[1:46:58] friends
[1:47:00] i want to ask you is this the rising of
[1:47:04] the sun
[1:47:07] was this whose resurrection is this
[1:47:10] anyways
[1:47:11] i want to say this is my resurrection
[1:47:13] this is my easter it's my easter every
[1:47:15] day
[1:47:16] why because the sun is risen amen and
[1:47:18] it's quick in the life on the inside
[1:47:20] and that life amen is quickened this
[1:47:22] mortal body
[1:47:23] and what i was i'm not anymore amen what
[1:47:26] i used to be and what i used to struggle
[1:47:28] with and what used to trip me up
[1:47:29] doesn't anymore amen and it wasn't me
[1:47:32] that stopped it was his life
[1:47:33] in me amen that brought this body
[1:47:36] subject to the word
[1:47:37] amen and it's quickened this mortal body
[1:47:40] and i'd like to say it is continuing to
[1:47:42] quicken this mortal body
[1:47:43] because as we move on and drink from
[1:47:45] that fountain amen it's growing and it's
[1:47:48] manifestation it's growing in its power
[1:47:50] it's growing in its life because the
[1:47:52] more we drink and the more we grow
[1:47:54] the more we manifest that life it is
[1:47:57] quick in this mortal body
[1:47:59] but i say it is still quickening
[1:48:02] this mortal body and that word
[1:48:06] my faith in that word will have its last
[1:48:09] quickening effect
[1:48:11] and i won't have to worry about this
[1:48:14] body anymore
[1:48:16] let's all stand musicians if you could
[1:48:17] come
[1:48:20] the word is so good friends
[1:48:25] you know when that
[1:48:29] holy ghost was waved in this day
[1:48:34] it showed that the full potential is
[1:48:36] here
[1:48:39] the full potential for anything that the
[1:48:41] word says
[1:48:42] the life the full life of that full word
[1:48:45] is here
[1:48:46] present tense the full potential
[1:48:50] for the manifestation of any word is
[1:48:51] here
[1:48:53] but there's a bride here that is that is
[1:48:56] so
[1:48:57] tied into the word and so submissive to
[1:48:59] her
[1:49:00] bridegroom to her headship to the word
[1:49:03] that she'll
[1:49:04] she'll have the same relationship to her
[1:49:06] bridegroom
[1:49:07] that christ had to his father and he
[1:49:10] only did that which pleased his father
[1:49:13] and he only did that which the father
[1:49:14] showed him the full potential of the
[1:49:16] full life is here for full manifestation
[1:49:20] but this isn't for a pentecostal
[1:49:22] manifestation where we manifest to feel
[1:49:25] good
[1:49:27] where we take the gifts and play with
[1:49:29] them and take the promises
[1:49:31] and and play with them for our own
[1:49:33] satisfaction and our own pleasure
[1:49:35] but now there's a bride that's coming
[1:49:37] into full maturity that's coming into a
[1:49:38] full surrender through her headship
[1:49:40] and she will only do that which pleases
[1:49:42] her husband
[1:49:44] the full potential for the full life is
[1:49:46] here amen
[1:49:47] and when he says move you have all the
[1:49:49] power of heaven to back you up in that
[1:49:52] move because the word says so
[1:49:54] but she's not going around moving on her
[1:49:56] own she's not going around
[1:49:57] declaring her own she's just submissive
[1:50:01] to the preeminence of christ to the
[1:50:02] headship of christ and anything he calls
[1:50:05] for
[1:50:06] the potential is already here the life
[1:50:08] is already here
[1:50:10] that's what we walk in when you come up
[1:50:12] against an obstacle
[1:50:13] amen when you come up against an
[1:50:15] obstacle whether it be health or whether
[1:50:17] it be
[1:50:17] something you need deliverance for
[1:50:18] whatever whatever obstacle you face in
[1:50:21] this day
[1:50:22] amen the same power that was there that
[1:50:24] day
[1:50:25] to lift up peter when he was sinking and
[1:50:26] helping walk back to the boat is the
[1:50:28] same power that was here
[1:50:29] the same one that opened blinded eyes
[1:50:31] the same one that raised the dead the
[1:50:33] same
[1:50:33] life is here in you and i friends
[1:50:36] when you come up against an obstacle all
[1:50:38] that is here amen we don't need to get
[1:50:41] more it's already here we just need to
[1:50:43] move as he gives us
[1:50:45] inspiration and as he moves through us
[1:50:46] we need to have confidence in what he's
[1:50:48] already done and who he is and who's
[1:50:50] here with us
[1:50:53] not doing our own thing but as he moves
[1:50:56] us
[1:50:56] we've got the confidence to move forward
[1:50:59] because the life is here it
[1:51:02] is the rising of the sun it is the
[1:51:05] restoration
[1:51:06] of the bride tree it is the resurrection
[1:51:08] of the bride out of dead
[1:51:09] denominationalism
[1:51:10] and what happened to the bride as a
[1:51:12] whole is happening to you as an
[1:51:13] individual
[1:51:14] it is our easter
[1:51:18] i want this easter to mean more to you
[1:51:20] than any easter before
[1:51:21] that's what brother branham said i said
[1:51:24] it means more to me than it ever has
[1:51:27] it's not me it's him
[1:51:30] amen let's sing
[1:51:34] it's just worship the sun is
[1:51:37] up now i can go
[1:51:41] free these chains that were holding me
[1:51:47] i can no longer see
[1:51:50] her long trumpets out
[1:51:54] declaring my jubilee
[1:51:57] now that i once had
[1:52:02] is restored to me because the price has
[1:52:06] been
[1:52:06] paid all my sins
[1:52:09] washed away now and for all
[1:52:17] [Music]
[1:52:28] is
[1:52:32] [Music]
[1:52:44] declaring my jubilee
[1:52:48] all that i once had
[1:52:51] again it's restored to me
[1:52:54] because the price has been paid
[1:52:58] all my sins washed away
[1:53:02] now and for always
[1:53:14] the sun up for you is it a bright day
[1:53:18] oh let's just keep laying in the
[1:53:20] presence of the sun and let it bake all
[1:53:22] of the greenness out
[1:53:24] all of the immaturity let it just fade
[1:53:26] away
[1:53:27] i'm tired of immaturity are you tired of
[1:53:29] immaturity
[1:53:30] i know who i am i know what he's called
[1:53:32] me to be i know what he's done in this
[1:53:34] day
[1:53:35] i've got no doubts about my identity who
[1:53:37] i am
[1:53:38] i'm just tired of the immaturity
[1:53:40] [Music]
[1:53:41] but there's a cure for that and it's to
[1:53:44] lay in the presence of the sun
[1:53:46] delay under this word amen in the life
[1:53:48] of the word and let it bake all of the
[1:53:49] greenness out
[1:53:51] i'm ready i'm ready to be baked out
[1:53:53] under this bright and shining light
[1:53:55] to be all that he's called me to be
[1:53:57] friends
[1:53:58] let's just bow our heads and pray
[1:54:02] dear lord we thank you for this message
[1:54:04] lord
[1:54:06] god every time we play it it's a
[1:54:08] privilege
