[0:00] to all of you growing up all you
[0:02] teenagers and your young adults and your
[0:04] children growing up it's a blessing to
[0:07] grow up in a family that loves god
[0:10] it's a blessing to grow up in an
[0:12] atmosphere that is focused on god and
[0:14] focused on his word it is a tremendous
[0:16] blessing to grow up sheltered from the
[0:18] things of the word world and taught the
[0:20] things of god but if you're not careful
[0:23] you will serve god for the acceptance of
[0:25] the people that you're around to please
[0:27] your parents to please your friends to
[0:29] fit in with the group and to obtain some
[0:32] sort of favor with god and to get
[0:34] something out of god and all of that at
[0:36] the end of the day amen is not going to
[0:39] get you where you want to be it is not
[0:41] accepted by god there's only one way to
[0:43] please god that's when you come to him
[0:45] out of a pure heart because you love him
[0:48] and him alone and regardless of what
[0:50] happens to you in return if everybody
[0:52] around you rejects you your parents kick
[0:54] you out amen all your friends reject you
[0:56] but you serve god because you love him
[0:58] that's the works that he's looking for
[1:01] that's the service that he'll accept
[1:03] amen he's not going to accept you going
[1:06] getting carried downstream where
[1:07] everybody's going and staying in the
[1:09] boundaries amen to be accepted that's
[1:11] not acceptable by god what's accepted by
[1:14] god is when you get real with god and
[1:15] say god i love you i want to love you
[1:18] more something in me has to change
[1:20] change me oh god to where i'm not doing
[1:23] service for people i'm not doing service
[1:25] for the ones i associate with i'm not
[1:27] doing it for a return of marriage i'm
[1:29] doing it based solely because i love you
[1:32] [Music]
[1:33] [Applause]
[1:34] amen and if we can't get to that point
[1:37] we need to dig a little deeper and dig a
[1:39] little deeper until we can get to the
[1:40] point where it says if mom and dad
[1:43] reject me if everybody rejects me if i
[1:46] get shipped off to another country by
[1:48] myself if i go with the same heart that
[1:50] i have now i will love him just the same
[1:53] there and serve him just the same there
[1:55] as i do today
[1:57] i'm not doing it because of the
[1:58] collective atmosphere i'm not doing it
[2:00] because of the collective thought i'm
[2:02] not doing this for acceptance i'm doing
[2:04] it because i love you god
[2:07] that was the blessing that the
[2:08] thyatirans were under their motives were
[2:11] proved by the atmosphere
[2:14] that's why brother brahm could say they
[2:16] were the cream of the crop that's why
[2:18] they could get such an admonition amen
[2:20] from the lord in in revelation chapter 2
[2:23] because their motives were proved by the
[2:26] circumstances
