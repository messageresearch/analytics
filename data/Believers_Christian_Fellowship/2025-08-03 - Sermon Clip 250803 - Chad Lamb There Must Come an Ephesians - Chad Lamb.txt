TRANSCRIPT
========================================
We each have to come to an Ephesians and be an Ephesians. We have to live exactly what Ephesians established in our own personal life because every Hebrew, every Israelite, every seed of Abraham that went into the promised land had to find their portion and had to possess it. &gt;&gt; And that means every member of this bride has to find their portion in the word and has to possess it. Amen. Possess all of this word that God's given to you. Don't wait for somebody else to do it. Amen. You can do it. You can live this word. You can manifest the word. You can pray for your children. You can pray for your neighbor. You can pray to God. You Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God and you can move mountains. God and you can speak squirrels into existence. God and you can do anything that's ever been done in this Bible. God can do it through each and every one of you because that's the purpose. That's the point. &gt;&gt; God in you. Christ in you, the hope of glory. That's where the church failed. The church failed by taking it from the people and putting it to a few gifted men, putting into the pullpit. Amen. And then then they begin to regulate it. Then everybody just come to church and was part of the right group. And part of the right group means that I'm automatically right. And they lost personal responsibility and personal manifestation. And that's why you can go into denominational churches and people live horrible lives. Amen. But they go to church and do their religious duty and they're somehow safe under a banner of the church. That's where the church fails. That's where Ephesus got off. But there's coming again in Ephesians in the end time where everybody takes their place in the word. &gt;&gt; And if the word says it, it's good enough for me. If the word says it, I'll live it. And if I'm having trouble live it, I'll go back to the word and say, "God, you've got to manifest this word through me by the power of your spirit because it's in the word. And I'm called to be an Ephesians in the end time, &gt;&gt; the full manifestation, part of the body, a joint that fully supplies, coming into perfection, growing into the head, into the stature of a perfect man. And if there's any limitation in me, there's got to be a power that removes that limitation because this is the hour of Ephesians. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we got to believe it. We got to act on it. We got to move forward with faith that God will remove the obstacles. Not bowing down because I tried to move the Canaanite before and they've got armored uh chariots of iron. I put them under. No. No tribute. Amen. We're taking all the land. We're all going to possess until we get a body change. &gt;&gt; Until our Adams change, we're going to keep pressing into this inheritance. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to stop with an old habit, with an old complex. I'm going to say, "God, deliver me. Deliver me. Deliver me. God says, "I'll help you. I'll fight for you. I'll drive out the enemies." &gt;&gt; Do you know when he stopped driving out the enemies? When they put them under tributes. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if we put them under tribute and come to some kind of working terms with a complex, some kind of working terms with bitterness in our heart, some kind of working terms with an old habit. Amen. Then God will stop fighting for you. Don't come to working terms with your complex. Don't come to working terms with your besetting sin. Push against it again. But what if I fail? Then push against it again. &gt;&gt; This is the Ephesians age. This is Joshua again. This is fully possessing the word of God.
