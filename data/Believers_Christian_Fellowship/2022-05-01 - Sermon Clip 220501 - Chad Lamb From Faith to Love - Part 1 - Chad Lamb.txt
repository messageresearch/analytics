TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so many people think they can say anything they want if it's true you'll see people sometimes say something to somebody it's so rude so cutting so sharp and you say something to them say but it was the truth jesus could have said a lot of things that was the truth but he didn't say a word when he stood before pilate he could have said a lot of things but he didn't speak when he was on the cross he could have said a lot of things that would have been every bit the truth but he kept his peace all he said is father forgive them we think sometimes we have a right to cut people down or set the record straight or expose somebody's sin or something like that and then we feel justified because it's the truth i think what we need is some holy ghost temperance to say what good would it do anyways it won't change them if you speak the truth you have to speak the truth in love so don't be angry at a brother and want to stick it to him and say i'm just saying this because i love you that doesn't justify what you're getting ready to do amen you have to really love them to say the truth not say you love them just to clear up you know i've already okay i love you okay now i'm going to cut you to the heart in front of your wife and your children but i already said i love you and i said it in love so it's the truth and i'm okay no we need some temperance to control ourselves no retaliation there's no there doesn't need to be any retaliation you know jesus didn't even set the record straight so many false accusations so many things were said against him so many lies defaming his character calling them bails above doubting his birth all these things they were coming against him amen denying his place in scripture denying his sonship all of these things and he never set the record straight he let them believe whatever they wanted to believe he had absolute temperance he was just going to do what god told him to do i mean so many times we're so tempted when somebody spoke evil about us or said something or a rumor comes full circle and comes around and you know that's not true hey you know what sometimes it doesn't do any good to set the record straight and most of the time when you try to set the record straight you look guiltier sometimes that's just a trap of the devil to get you in a little deeper jesus didn't pay the time of day to it he kept doing what the father called him to do and i think it's a good habit for us to not pay any attention to the rhetoric not pay any attention to the accusation of somebody at work he's trying to defame your character trying to take credit for your work just let it go let god expose it when god does it's way better anyways you're not here for a promotion and you're not here for a good name at work you're here to serve god's purpose and if it god's purpose he has you in that job and you need a good standing in that job god will right the wrong and when god writes the wrong i mean nobody can work like god can work and nobody can fix a situation like god can fix the situation in fact if you keep quiet and have temperance in hand and you just wait on the lord and have patience you watch god work by the time god's done you'll feel sorry for that man or woman that's what will happen you'll have sympathy for them and because i mean you could have been so upset so hurt and have such a temptation to go set the record straight because you know that they would be in big trouble you didn't do anything wrong they did it wrong they're lying blah blah blah whatever but you just hush up and have temperance control yourself and stay in the line god puts you in and when god solves that problem you end up saying oh god help them i'm sorry i didn't want that to happen to them you'll feel so sorry for them amen what is it going to take holy ghost temperance
