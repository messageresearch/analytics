[18:25] in prayer
[18:28] [Music]
[18:29] Lord what a
[18:31] thought Lord we want our
[18:34] spirit and our thoughts to be
[18:37] quieted Lord there are so many voices
[18:40] that are in the world that are trying to
[18:43] make their way into our minds and our
[18:45] hearts but Lord Jesus we pray that this
[18:49] morning you will quiet our hearts that
[18:51] we might step into that that private
[18:54] place with
[18:55] you lord it's not a group effort
[18:59] but Lord individually we have to seek
[19:01] you but your word says if we seek you
[19:04] that we would find
[19:06] you so Lord we're looking to you with
[19:08] faith this
[19:09] morning God I'm here as just a
[19:12] vessel but Lord The Vessel be yielded to
[19:15] you it's all yours Lord you can do with
[19:17] it as you
[19:18] please Lord help me to step out of the
[19:21] way Lord may you may you bless not only
[19:24] the speaker but the hearer also for Lord
[19:27] Jesus it's a supernatural thing because
[19:30] the message is not from man to man but
[19:33] it is from God to
[19:35] man Lord you said if you had the vessels
[19:38] that you would perfect the Saints Lord
[19:41] may you perfect us just a little more
[19:43] today may we take a step closer to you
[19:45] and when we leave this place may we go
[19:47] rejoicing with the testimony that I met
[19:49] God once again today he spoke to my
[19:52] heart he changed my life for the better
[19:55] I can do nothing but praise him because
[19:57] he's magnificent he's glorious
[19:59] he's
[20:01] faithful Lord Jesus we ask that you have
[20:03] all the praise and the glory we commit
[20:06] Our Time Lord and take our little
[20:08] thoughts and break them Lord as you did
[20:11] with the disciples Lord we can read the
[20:13] scriptures all day long but until the
[20:15] spirit break it open for us Lord we
[20:17] can't understand it we can't see it for
[20:19] truly what it is but Lord your spirit is
[20:22] here your word is here now we pray Lord
[20:25] that you would break the bread for your
[20:26] children in the name of Jesus J Christ
[20:29] we commit it all to you
[20:32] amen praise the Lord praise the Lord
[20:35] praise the Lord thank you
[20:37] musicians God bless you Saints I greet
[20:39] you in the name of the Lord It's been
[20:42] some time since we've been able to visit
[20:45] with you here so I greet you and I just
[20:47] I appreciate the testimony that you're
[20:49] here today you're pressing toward the
[20:51] mark of the high
[20:53] calling it God never promised that
[20:55] things would be easy he never promised
[20:57] that we wouldn't have trials in fact he
[21:00] said if they've done these things to me
[21:02] they'll do more to
[21:04] you but he also promised he would never
[21:06] leave us he would never forsake us and I
[21:09] stand here before you today to profess
[21:12] that that testimony is true yes that
[21:15] Jesus has never left us the message that
[21:18] he gave us gets sweeter every day his
[21:21] Spirit gets more present more personal
[21:24] every day I'm here as a testimony and I
[21:27] appreciate each one of you being here
[21:29] we'll be praying for you we ask that you
[21:32] continue to keep us in prayer up in the
[21:35] Lorraine Cleveland area just keep us in
[21:37] prayer and we're striving to grow in the
[21:40] Lord and we are praying for you also
[21:42] wherever the Saints are GA gathered we
[21:45] know that God is Not constrained by the
[21:47] Four Walls of a building this is not the
[21:50] church the church is wherever those
[21:52] souls are gathered together Born Again
[21:55] born into the body looking for that
[21:57] coming day when the trumpet sounds Lord
[22:00] our work is done it's time to go home
[22:02] it's time for a honeymoon are you
[22:04] looking forward to that day praise the
[22:06] Lord God is so good if you have your
[22:09] Bibles let's turn to Genesis chapter 1
[22:13] very familiar scriptures but we're going
[22:15] to start
[22:16] here because of course we like to start
[22:19] in the
[22:20] beginning as we know it is the seed
[22:23] chapter to all of the all that is to
[22:27] come I ask that you'd pray for me today
[22:30] we have
[22:31] uh some of the thoughts of ministered at
[22:34] home but we have quite a few things
[22:35] we're going to try to bring together
[22:37] today and the picture is really simple
[22:40] when the Lord makes it
[22:42] simple see if it's us it gets really
[22:46] complicated sir and then you walk away
[22:48] from a service saying that was really
[22:49] deep what was it about I have no idea
[22:52] you know we're not here for that we're
[22:54] here that God would be personal amen
[22:57] because the message that God gives you
[22:59] on
[23:00] Sunday is for
[23:02] Monday you think God's going to be
[23:04] surprised by the trial that you have
[23:06] tomorrow no so if he gives you a
[23:09] prophetic word he's going to give you a
[23:11] word today to overcome tomorrow and
[23:13] Tuesday and Wednesday when you come for
[23:15] a refreshing you can say that God gave
[23:17] me Deliverance because he told me what
[23:19] was going to come ahead of
[23:21] time God is that kind of faithful
[23:25] God praise the Lord
[23:30] here in Genesis let's look in chapter 1
[23:32] we're going to read verses 1 to 4 just
[23:34] to begin laying a little bit of a
[23:37] foundation again we've got some thoughts
[23:40] uh uh I've tried to organize the
[23:42] thoughts here as best I can but we could
[23:44] go in a thousand different directions
[23:47] and by the grace of God again we want it
[23:49] to be simple we want the children to be
[23:51] able to leave today and say I got
[23:52] something out of that we want the the
[23:55] saints that are soldiers scarred up and
[23:57] been walking with the Lord for 50 years
[23:59] we want them to walk away today and said
[24:01] I got something out of that because
[24:03] again our God is that kind of God so
[24:06] here in Genesis chapter 1 we're just
[24:09] going to read verses 1 to 4 once again
[24:11] very familiar verses but as we like to
[24:13] do we're just going to take one aspect
[24:15] of this and then kind of follow it
[24:17] through the scriptures Genesis 1 and one
[24:21] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[24:22] and the Earth and the Earth was without
[24:24] form I want to stop there just for a
[24:26] moment and emphasize that that the Earth
[24:29] was without form and void and the
[24:32] Darkness was upon the face of the deep
[24:33] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[24:35] face of the waters and God said let
[24:37] there be light and there was light and
[24:39] God saw the light that it was good and
[24:42] God divided the light from the darkness
[24:46] and again I want to emphasize that that
[24:47] God divided the light from the darkness
[24:51] may the Lord bless the word you may have
[24:52] your
[24:56] seats I want to emphasize
[24:59] today this aspect that we've just read
[25:02] here in Genesis that God
[25:06] formed because there's a very simple
[25:08] aspect of God being the
[25:11] Creator and everyone would say or not
[25:13] everyone but those that claim to be
[25:15] Christians that believe in creation that
[25:18] God created the heavens and the Earth
[25:20] they would call God the
[25:22] Creator I think we would say well that's
[25:25] relatively simple but see all of the
[25:28] times when we say that we believe things
[25:30] if we truly understand them the way that
[25:32] we think we do our lives will reflect it
[25:36] because when we understand that he is
[25:37] the creator we understand that he's the
[25:39] one that formed we understand the
[25:43] implication we understand the authority
[25:47] that it took to
[25:49] create I would challenge today if any
[25:51] one of us here today truly had that
[25:53] settled in a heart you could never be
[25:56] sick right you could have symptoms in
[25:59] your body but you would never be
[26:01] sick because the Creator made me sir
[26:04] when you understand that fully you can
[26:06] understand that no devil in hell could
[26:08] ever have authority over you because
[26:10] they're not the Creator that's right you
[26:12] see the simple thought that he's the
[26:14] Creator we say well yes we know but when
[26:16] God begins to unfold it truly to us in a
[26:19] personal way suddenly you have
[26:22] overcoming power in your daily life
[26:25] that's right Lord today we're going to
[26:29] cover really these four parts and again
[26:32] I've done the best I can to to try to
[26:34] organize this and we could go a thousand
[26:36] different directions but we're going to
[26:38] cover today really four main
[26:41] points the maker the heart the hammer
[26:47] and the
[26:48] keeper and our thoughts for today will
[26:51] be titled the hammer and the
[26:53] Heart the hammer and the
[26:56] heart and again we're going to cover
[26:58] this in four parts the maker the heart
[27:01] the hammer and the
[27:04] keeper there are so many things about
[27:06] life once again that I grew up in the in
[27:09] and around the message one could say but
[27:12] again we have to even look at the way we
[27:14] say things we we say things and they're
[27:16] comfortable to us I'm in the
[27:19] message but if you're not born again the
[27:21] message is not in
[27:22] you to be in the message I will be with
[27:25] you even in you to be in Christ and
[27:27] Christ in you you must have sold out
[27:30] everything that you have there's nothing
[27:32] that I value more than him Lord truly I
[27:35] want you to have preeminence now we may
[27:36] struggle with that in the process of
[27:38] adoption and growing and placing of
[27:40] those Sons we may grow in that process
[27:43] but Saints God has preeminence we we've
[27:47] given him that we've sold out we said
[27:49] Lord there's nothing there's nothing I
[27:52] can
[27:53] do it's as simple as coming to the Lord
[27:56] we we would say we uh uh many of us
[27:58] maybe have talked to someone maybe led
[28:00] someone to the Lord and introduced them
[28:02] to Jesus Christ but even that simple
[28:04] process of leading we would say a simple
[28:06] process of leading someone to the Lord
[28:08] who are you introducing them to on what
[28:11] basis are they coming see the Old
[28:13] Testament saints were justified by sight
[28:18] no by faith amen they were justified by
[28:21] faith what does Justified means it means
[28:23] as if they never did it amen they put
[28:26] their faith in the word that came to
[28:30] them and it is putting our faith when we
[28:34] started our journey with Christ it's
[28:36] putting our faith in what Jesus Christ
[28:38] did on
[28:39] Calvary we have such confidence in that
[28:42] Saints and let's stop there for a moment
[28:45] well that's Elementary brother when
[28:48] we've got our ABCs in order but Saints
[28:51] understand that if you have that in
[28:53] order you would understand that you can
[28:55] never be depressed right
[28:59] well well we do have an understanding of
[29:01] that but we're growing in that
[29:04] understanding brother Nathaniel why are
[29:06] you stopping and emphasizing these
[29:07] things because the most dangerous thing
[29:10] that we can do in a as a Christian is
[29:12] say I got
[29:15] that I understand that I can say today
[29:19] that I understand what God has given me
[29:21] thus
[29:22] far and that thing that I'm holding is
[29:25] only going to get bigger amen it's only
[29:28] going to become more
[29:31] profound so as we look at these thoughts
[29:33] today we again like I said it pray for
[29:36] me we can go in many different
[29:37] directions we we had a service last
[29:39] night at home and we got on the road uh
[29:42] I don't remember what time it was but we
[29:43] got into the hotel about midnight last
[29:45] night we uh our little guy he was four
[29:47] years old was was uh had a fever this
[29:50] morning at about 6:00 a.m. so of course
[29:52] we're up a little bit early and we were
[29:54] a little bit tired today so I appreciate
[29:56] your prayers but you know as we were
[29:58] talking I was talking to brother Chad
[29:59] and brother Jeremy stopped by to say
[30:01] good morning and appreciated that very
[30:03] much you know at this point that's old
[30:06] news if you go to work for the Lord
[30:09] guess what the devil's going to do if he
[30:11] can't get you he's going to get it your
[30:12] children he's going to get your wife
[30:13] he's going to get it
[30:14] something so if you know that you're
[30:16] going to go work for the Lord expect
[30:18] trials now you're not asking for the
[30:20] trials you're not looking to pick a
[30:21] fight right we're not looking around hey
[30:23] where devil where's the devil at no no
[30:26] no but if you cross paths with that
[30:29] devil now you've got a word to stand on
[30:33] Sir so these things I just share that
[30:35] with you just to see that the devil's
[30:36] already fighting but you know Saints you
[30:38] can't have a victory without a battle do
[30:41] you believe that God is
[30:42] Victorious and even saying amen is to
[30:45] claim there has been a battle there has
[30:48] to be a battle we have to acknowledge it
[30:50] we have to be okay with that and we're
[30:52] okay with
[30:53] that so we're a little bit tired today
[30:55] and again I just just appreciate your
[30:57] prayers to
[30:58] uh there's many things that we can
[31:00] preach
[31:01] on you know anymore the challenge is not
[31:05] finding something to preach on in in my
[31:07] notes anymore I've gotten to the point
[31:09] where I I have I have all my notes I
[31:11] have a a lot of things written down and
[31:13] I'll get to the point I'll say dot dot
[31:15] dot enough it's not done it's enough
[31:18] it's enough for one day this is what we
[31:20] can handle for one day there's so many
[31:22] good things that we can handle is God
[31:25] good I just appreciate the warm wel
[31:27] welcome that we got this morning it was
[31:30] uh talking to the brothers in the back
[31:31] and and uh brother Chad was just so warm
[31:33] and welcoming I really appreciate that
[31:35] Saints again the devil fights everywhere
[31:38] and it's good to be with Saints of like
[31:39] Precious
[31:43] Faith so let's go if you would to
[31:45] Colossians chapter
[31:49] 1 we're now going to start digging in a
[31:52] little bit and and maybe building our
[31:55] subject we're going to build a subject
[31:57] that might take a little while today but
[31:59] we'll also have some fun along the
[32:02] way you believe in having fun in church
[32:06] I do I don't think there should be
[32:08] anything that we enjoy more than being
[32:09] in
[32:10] Church Holy Spirit starts to good starts
[32:13] to move and I've just start feeling so
[32:15] good I start to laugh everyone's
[32:17] different but that's how it fits me I
[32:18] just oh my heart is so happy I don't
[32:21] know what else to
[32:24] do Colossians chapter 1 we can have fun
[32:28] in church our God is a good god
[32:31] Colossians chapter 1 let's read verses
[32:33] 13-
[32:35] 22 now this is of course talking about
[32:38] Christ here who hath delivered us from
[32:41] the power of darkness and hath
[32:42] translated us into the kingdom of his
[32:45] dear son in whom we have Redemption
[32:48] through his blood even the Forgiveness
[32:50] of sins who is the image of the
[32:52] invisible God the firstborn of every
[32:56] creature let's pause there there just
[32:58] for a
[32:59] moment he is the
[33:02] image of the invisible God just hold
[33:06] hold that in your hearts just there for
[33:07] a moment verse number 16 now for by him
[33:11] were all things created oh he is the
[33:14] creator we're talking about the sun
[33:18] now that all that are in heaven Let's uh
[33:21] verse summer 16 again for by him were
[33:23] all things created that are in heaven
[33:26] and that are in the earth visible and in
[33:27] invisible whether they be Thrones or
[33:30] dominions or principalities or Powers
[33:32] all things were created by Him and for
[33:35] him amen and he is before all things and
[33:39] by him all things consist and he is the
[33:42] head of the body the church who is the
[33:44] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[33:46] that in all things he might have
[33:49] preeminence for it pleased the father
[33:51] that in him should all fullness dwell
[33:54] let's also hold on to that and having
[33:57] made peace through the blood of his
[33:58] cross by him to reconcile all things
[34:00] unto himself by by him I say whether
[34:04] they be things in the Earth or things in
[34:05] heaven and you that were sometimes
[34:07] alienated and enemies in your mind by
[34:09] the wicked works by Wicked Works yet now
[34:12] hath he reconciled in the body of his
[34:15] flesh through death to present you holy
[34:17] and unblamable and unreprovable in his
[34:19] sight again so many things that we could
[34:21] stop on but we're going to emphasize a
[34:24] few things here all things were made by
[34:26] him we're going to reiterate I'm sure
[34:28] many of you are familiar with the
[34:29] picture but again we want to be on the
[34:31] same page here because brother brandom
[34:34] describes this scene that in the
[34:36] beginning the father who is all
[34:40] things he speaks and the son is created
[34:42] and this is the
[34:44] logos describes it like the pillar of
[34:46] fire comes into
[34:48] being but I want to look at this one
[34:50] aspect of that process today that of
[34:52] course we know that the trinitarians
[34:54] would believe that Jesus Christ uh the
[34:57] the ex of God he is eternally a son
[35:00] brother Brandon was very clear on that
[35:02] and just highlighted the Simplicity of
[35:03] the fact that a son has to come from the
[35:06] father otherwise it doesn't make any
[35:09] sense as it Des describes again again in
[35:11] the trinitarian doctrine they are
[35:13] co-equal and co-eternal so Eternal
[35:17] sunship of course again that's not true
[35:20] he was expressed from the
[35:24] father God began to form something as we
[35:29] read here in Genesis and the the rest of
[35:31] Genesis articulates that all of the
[35:33] process of God creating all of
[35:36] creation but God began in his mind he
[35:38] had a thought and when he had the
[35:40] thought he began to form things to his
[35:43] thought amen so he formed that that
[35:45] logos the expression of God again for
[35:48] John 1:1 in the beginning was the word
[35:50] the logos and the Word was with God and
[35:52] the Word was God so we know what the
[35:55] word is we know what the logos is so
[35:58] it's not two separate things but again
[36:00] from our minds as a in a human thinking
[36:03] we already begin to struggle because now
[36:05] it seems like there's
[36:07] two this is the the aspect of things
[36:11] where the trinitarian doctrine gets
[36:14] people sucked in because it seems to
[36:16] explain things from a human
[36:19] perspective it seems to make it make
[36:22] sense and then you have a prophet that
[36:24] comes along and says oh Eternal sunship
[36:27] doesn't make sense oh you're right it
[36:30] doesn't how simple is that does it ever
[36:33] Astound you just for a moment does it
[36:35] ever Astound you how much that brother
[36:37] bandam would pick things out like that
[36:39] now we know where it came from but you
[36:42] understand Saints it's not because he
[36:44] was a
[36:45] genius he was just connected to the
[36:47] right
[36:49] source and the things that he's talking
[36:51] about we're now trying to express and
[36:54] explain and and break it down but the
[36:56] Simplicity of of this thought that God
[36:58] was the self-existing one and he began
[37:01] to
[37:02] form but now I want to to highlight this
[37:05] aspect that from of course the logos
[37:07] comes all creation he expresses himself
[37:10] he forms this this this uh expression of
[37:13] himself and then from that comes
[37:15] everything
[37:16] else as we just read here in
[37:19] Colossians but this aspect of God
[37:23] forming being a
[37:25] Creator just for a moment we're going
[37:27] going to really dig into that
[37:31] thought because God is the maker right
[37:35] of course he made the heavens and the
[37:36] Earth he made you and I he made the air
[37:38] he made
[37:40] everything but when God formed the
[37:44] things when he formed them he defined
[37:49] them he set their
[37:51] boundaries he said you are this every
[37:54] form of life was then set and and sub
[37:57] subject to an authority of a rule every
[38:00] seed must produce after its kind you can
[38:04] only be what God created you to be you
[38:07] can't be anything else well why can you
[38:09] not be anything else because God defined
[38:12] you God defined me God defined all of
[38:17] creation when he set things in order he
[38:19] formed it and in the process of forming
[38:22] forming it he was defining
[38:24] it he was limiting the extent to which
[38:29] it could do
[38:30] things in the natural sense you can't
[38:33] fly like a bird God didn't make you that
[38:36] way but if God wanted you to of course
[38:38] you could we know that Elijah ascended
[38:41] up Jesus ascended up they saw it there's
[38:44] many
[38:45] witnesses but God set in this natural
[38:48] world he set things in order and he
[38:50] formed things with limitation but now I
[38:52] want to really let's take out the
[38:55] microscope and really zoom in on this
[38:57] thought just for a moment the maker has
[39:00] made and he has made because he has
[39:03] authority to
[39:05] make he has authority to create and the
[39:10] thing created is now
[39:12] subject to that creative
[39:16] Authority because he created not because
[39:19] the creation asked not because the
[39:22] creation bargained with God but the act
[39:25] of creating has now set the thing in
[39:28] order and the thing is subject to God
[39:31] because it was formed by God his
[39:34] creative Authority set the bounds set
[39:37] the structure set the characteristics of
[39:41] every single form of life amen and every
[39:45] single form of life is subject to the
[39:48] creative authority of the
[39:51] Creator right but what is the one being
[39:55] that's not subject to that
[39:58] yes that's him
[40:01] yes
[40:03] he is the creator that's right the
[40:08] Creator is not subject to a higher
[40:11] authority so the Creator can change his
[40:15] form as he
[40:18] pleases if the Elohim the self-existing
[40:21] one wants to make himself into the
[40:23] pillar of fire he can do it if the
[40:26] pillar of Fire wants to form himself
[40:28] into a body of a person he can do it
[40:32] this is the aspect where people are
[40:34] trying to wrap their heads around how
[40:36] God condescended and became a man they
[40:39] cannot wrap their heads around God
[40:42] himself is not subject to another
[40:44] creative
[40:45] power God himself is the creative power
[40:49] sir he can change form he can make form
[40:53] he can set the limits of
[40:56] form and he can change it at his
[41:00] pleasure obviously we see in the Garden
[41:03] of Eden that the form of the serpent was
[41:05] changed why because it had corrupted
[41:08] something and God said that'll never
[41:09] happen again so the one with creative
[41:12] Authority changed the form but no one
[41:16] else can do
[41:17] that only the one holding the creative
[41:21] Authority can do it
[41:27] the creator has
[41:29] exclusive creative authority to set the
[41:33] form of creation have we got that now
[41:37] praise the
[41:38] Lord but he being the Creator with
[41:42] authority to Define what form life will
[41:44] take can change his own form
[41:47] amen it's simple yet we get lost not
[41:53] understanding sometimes that he is
[41:55] absolute in author
[41:58] Authority Saints how many times did the
[42:01] prophet say just take him at his word
[42:03] just take him at his word just take him
[42:04] at his word thousands thousands of times
[42:08] are we doing it 100% of the
[42:11] time we're still
[42:14] growing what are we trying to latch on
[42:17] to to hold on to to understand that his
[42:19] authority his Integrity is above all
[42:23] things and that he all of of of creation
[42:27] we look at creation and we say oh the
[42:29] body
[42:30] hurts but you understand that this was
[42:34] created and therefore because it was
[42:37] created it is subject to the Creator
[42:40] amen and though cre corrupted though
[42:44] Satan has tried to steal it corrupt it
[42:46] uh Mar it it's still subject to the
[42:51] Creator no matter what happens no matter
[42:53] what we go through no matter what the
[42:54] trial is he is still absolute in
[42:58] Authority he's not partial in
[43:01] Authority the only thing that God is
[43:04] obligated to is his own
[43:08] word there's no other authority that is
[43:11] above
[43:12] him he can change things as he
[43:18] Wills I'm I'm literally at a loss for
[43:21] words because there's a thousand
[43:22] different things that we can say that's
[43:24] so profound in my heart God God is over
[43:29] everything see we know it but do we know
[43:32] it because when you're in the midst of
[43:35] the trial when you're depressed if
[43:36] you're a minister when you're down on a
[43:41] Monday right because the anointing is G
[43:43] is gone from from you in that way to
[43:45] minister and now you're at home and
[43:47] you're feeling alone and you're feeling
[43:48] down in that moment is he still the
[43:52] Creator brother sister when you hit
[43:54] Monday you're back at work and you find
[43:56] that you hit Monday and the devil's just
[43:58] coming against you had a wonderful
[43:59] service on Sunday you get to Monday and
[44:01] oh everything just hits is he still the
[44:04] Creator
[44:05] then that's the thing that God wants out
[44:07] of his children when we understand
[44:10] exactly who our father is he's Absolut
[44:13] in Authority not partial he's not
[44:14] bargaining with creation he's just
[44:18] absolute when we're resting in that
[44:20] there's nothing that the devil can do
[44:22] that's right amen but we live in a world
[44:27] that is trying as hard as it
[44:29] can to corrupt itself right but if you
[44:33] look at it in this perspective Saints
[44:35] society that the world that we live in
[44:37] today is trying to change its
[44:41] form in every
[44:43] way what is it it's a rebellious world
[44:48] trying to rebel against the authority of
[44:51] the
[44:52] maker I can be anything I want no you
[44:56] can't you can be what God made you to
[44:59] be well I don't believe it it doesn't
[45:02] matter what you believe because creation
[45:04] is still subject to the
[45:07] Creator nothing has been out of kilter
[45:10] all things have gone according to the
[45:12] way that God permitted it to God has not
[45:14] done wickedness but he's allowed Free
[45:16] Will so that uh we have the opportunity
[45:19] to make that kind of
[45:22] choice this is from 1965 and knoweth it
[45:25] not all the fullness of all things is
[45:28] talking about
[45:29] Jesus all the fullness of God all the
[45:32] fullness of the angels all the fullness
[45:35] of time all the fullness of Eternity
[45:39] everything dwelt in him that's this
[45:43] fellow God changed his
[45:46] form God condescended he limited himself
[45:49] he didn't know all things why because
[45:51] he's a God he is the god he's the
[45:53] Creator he can do
[45:54] that so he did it that's right and
[45:57] people say well but how what do you mean
[46:01] he's the Creator he can do whatever he
[46:05] chooses well how does this and he's
[46:07] talking to himself he's doing this he's
[46:09] a Creator he expressed himself he's not
[46:12] subject to a higher
[46:15] authority we got that right I know I'm
[46:18] taking them taking a few minutes we're
[46:19] we're really pounding that nail in
[46:21] because so many things are built upon
[46:25] that amen
[46:28] now let me introduce
[46:31] you to this
[46:34] plant our thought today is the hammer
[46:38] and the
[46:40] heart and today we're going to describe
[46:43] this
[46:44] plant represents the
[46:48] heart God has created the world he said
[46:50] in the beginning God created male and
[46:52] female amen male and female created he
[46:55] them
[46:57] why do you think it is that God
[46:58] presented himself in this
[47:01] age even the age itself is referred to
[47:04] as the bright age why do you think that
[47:07] is why do you think it is that in this
[47:10] age Satan is fighting every day to
[47:14] destroy the idea of what a man is and
[47:18] what a woman is why do you think that is
[47:21] you think it's coincidence no Satan has
[47:24] had thousands of years to watch what God
[47:26] has doing why do you think he's trying
[47:28] to
[47:29] corrupt the very vision of a man and
[47:33] woman and why do you think it took a
[47:35] prophet to come and and describe the a
[47:38] proper relationship and and a and when
[47:40] God be uh uh began to express to us that
[47:43] God was calling us and that we were in
[47:44] his mind in the beginning and and we
[47:46] were uh we have a relationship first as
[47:48] it seems to us as a servant but he said
[47:50] I don't call you a servant anymore I
[47:52] call you a son well praise the lord it's
[47:54] a it's a more mature relationship but
[47:56] there's a relationship that God at the
[47:58] end has described himself in the
[48:01] church it's a bride and a
[48:05] bridegroom
[48:07] coincidence see this relationship is
[48:09] based on the choice of the two
[48:13] people so today we're going to just go
[48:16] through a few examples the world is
[48:18] again trying to corrupt this in every
[48:20] way that that they
[48:22] can but there's so many spiritual things
[48:25] that God is doing this has been on my
[48:26] heart for quite some time and not in a
[48:29] in a in a sense of trying to respond to
[48:31] the world but yet in the on the other
[48:33] hand if the devil is trying to attack a
[48:35] subject it should raise our alert why
[48:39] why is this happening so for today's
[48:41] example I'm going to again I'm going to
[48:42] introduce this is the plant this is the
[48:45] heart now this is going to represent our
[48:50] sisters you see in the world that we
[48:53] live in today people are trying to
[48:56] express that a woman needs to have a
[48:57] career she needs to be a career if she's
[49:00] going to have children she can work and
[49:02] maybe have a babysitter raise the
[49:04] kids but you see God
[49:09] formed God
[49:12] defined and God defined something that's
[49:15] so unique and special that he couldn't
[49:18] create it
[49:20] firsthand you go back to marriage and
[49:22] divorce and it sounds almost harsh the
[49:24] way that brother manam is explaining
[49:25] that the woman was a byproduct of the
[49:27] man and he's using terms that he's
[49:30] trying to express this thought but
[49:32] understand something saints that God did
[49:34] not create you in the in the moment God
[49:37] did not create you with no adversity no
[49:40] no uh uh how would you say it with no
[49:42] choice he gave you Free
[49:44] Will and he couldn't create that
[49:49] firsthand he had to create a creature
[49:51] that was so unique that's right that it
[49:54] had the choice to choose God
[49:57] or to not choose
[49:59] God the uniqueness of this creature
[50:03] where in the world that we live in today
[50:04] people are trying to emphasize the
[50:07] independence of the woman try trying to
[50:10] to to uh add value to what it means to
[50:14] be a woman you know the more revealing
[50:16] that you dress the more beautiful that
[50:18] you are what they're really saying is
[50:20] the more lust that you can provoke the
[50:22] more beautiful that you are they're
[50:24] equating Beauty and lust
[50:27] right that's of course we know is not
[50:29] Beauty but the world is trying to add to
[50:33] these things and and the world is saying
[50:35] well you can have a job and you can have
[50:36] a career and I heard someone referring
[50:38] to this they had talked to a woman that
[50:39] was had two degrees and she was a CEO of
[50:42] a company and and as The Story Goes she
[50:45] was almost crying in the interview
[50:47] because she said I go home to an empty
[50:50] house I don't have anyone that loves me
[50:53] no one that cares for
[50:54] me see in its most basic Bic form Saints
[50:58] people are trying to change their
[51:00] form what they're saying is that the the
[51:03] form that I was created in is not good
[51:05] enough so I'm trying to change
[51:08] it but I want to emphasize today when
[51:11] God made something that was so
[51:14] special you could not force it to be he
[51:17] himself is God being the Creator he has
[51:19] all authority to change all things he
[51:22] could not would not create this thing in
[51:24] its finished form
[51:27] he created with the capacity to be that
[51:29] finished form but it had to make its own
[51:33] choice it had to go on a journey Jesus
[51:36] himself was perfected by the things he
[51:38] suffered there's a process that God has
[51:41] has has defined there's a process that
[51:44] God has described to us and that process
[51:46] as we talk about today is adoption your
[51:48] salvation is a was written before the
[51:50] foundation of the world when you're
[51:52] converted you're filled with the Holy
[51:53] Ghost that's an event something takes
[51:55] place you don't walk away from that the
[51:57] event saying I wonder
[52:00] if now there might be a time where you
[52:02] don't understand what happened and you
[52:04] have to grow in that but there's
[52:05] something that changes so much in you
[52:07] you walk away from you say something's
[52:09] different I may not be able to say what
[52:11] but something's different but now as God
[52:14] has come into your heart that if that
[52:15] the Lord is is dwelling in you you now
[52:18] begin to grow into the revelation of
[52:21] what God has done in you and it is that
[52:25] process that god holds so
[52:28] precious and God made a
[52:32] woman as a byproduct of a man and you
[52:35] you might think uh again as the
[52:36] terminology brother benam used well it
[52:38] almost sounds like the waste product or
[52:40] the extra thing no no no don't allow
[52:42] your mind to go there that's not what he
[52:43] was saying that's not what God has
[52:45] expressed God confus or or people get
[52:48] confused with the scriptures say that
[52:50] the woman is the weaker vessel and and
[52:53] the people have gotten this idea that
[52:55] the woman is the Lesser vessel that
[52:58] somehow she has valued less that's so
[53:01] false that's absolutely wrong God does
[53:03] not believe that I can prove it to you
[53:07] if you were going to buy something and
[53:09] you said I want to buy something I want
[53:10] to buy this clicker and let's say I
[53:13] don't know how much it is let's say it's
[53:15] $30 if you have $30 in your hand and
[53:17] you're willing to buy this clicker what
[53:19] you're saying is the price I'm willing
[53:21] to pay I I I value this more than the
[53:24] price I have yeah and God laid down his
[53:27] life to purchase
[53:29] you so how does he value your life more
[53:33] than his own so the idea that a woman is
[53:37] less as in lesser value is so completely
[53:40] false it's a man's idea a self-serving
[53:43] man came up with that idea God never
[53:46] communicated
[53:48] that and and humanity is tried to build
[53:51] up or change or or Define value because
[53:54] they lost the vision amen of what makes
[53:57] a woman so
[53:59] special and again we're going to
[54:01] represent it this way in our flower the
[54:04] heart you try
[54:07] to try to form this try to make it to be
[54:11] what it is it won't
[54:14] work you have to start with something
[54:16] small and you get in the right
[54:17] conditions and it grows something we're
[54:20] very familiar with right the seed must
[54:22] produce am so to further explain this
[54:27] this uh picture that we have
[54:29] here brother random says in
[54:32] 1960 he carth for you man was made to
[54:36] want to be
[54:38] comforted who made
[54:41] him the maker
[54:43] right what image was he made in image of
[54:47] God if a man was made to want to be
[54:49] comforted what about God it's not good
[54:52] that God that man dwells alone why is
[54:55] that God wanted
[54:57] Fellowship we could say another word for
[54:59] Fellowship is your heart comforted when
[55:01] you have Fellowship absolutely you want
[55:05] to express yourself and you want that
[55:07] person to express themselves to you it
[55:10] is the
[55:11] relationship that is the value so let's
[55:14] see man was made to want to be comforted
[55:17] so then if he doesn't accept God's way
[55:19] then he'll make a way for himself and
[55:20] he'll try to substitute something to
[55:23] take the place of that Holy Spirit oh I
[55:27] want you to listen to it a man or a
[55:29] woman that will not accept the Holy
[55:31] Spirit the comforter will try to comfort
[55:34] themselves with some violent substitute
[55:38] that Satan will present to them Satan
[55:41] has got plenty of substitutes but why do
[55:45] we have why do we have a substitute when
[55:48] the Pentecostal skies are full of the
[55:51] real why would I eat from a garbage can
[55:54] when I have a clean table is setting
[55:57] full of choicy
[56:01] foods why would we try to
[56:03] change what God made now maybe you or I
[56:07] in the Integrity of our heart we don't
[56:09] want to do that but what we're talking
[56:11] about today is do we truly understand
[56:13] what exactly God was trying to
[56:16] achieve so now I have another part that
[56:19] we're going to use as an example
[56:22] today and and I haven't communicated
[56:25] this ahead of time so
[56:27] I don't know if I should apologize or
[56:29] brother John small can I have your
[56:33] help come on brother he didn't get a
[56:36] warning so he doesn't have a script
[56:37] ahead of time we didn't practice in the
[56:40] mirror before
[56:45] service I understand brother that you
[56:47] are a contractor is that true general
[56:51] contractor oh we need a microphone
[56:59] let's see
[57:01] here okay I turned it on
[57:05] Blue oh somebody's
[57:10] good you ever seen one of
[57:12] these yes just want to make
[57:16] sure his hands look like he seen one of
[57:18] those
[57:20] before what is this it's a
[57:23] hammer it's a hammer okay
[57:27] a
[57:28] MILF so what's your experience with one
[57:31] of
[57:32] these depends on the
[57:36] day sometimes it's used as a driver and
[57:39] sometimes it's used as a
[57:41] puller how many years have you worked
[57:43] with a
[57:44] hammer um probably in excess of 30 I
[57:48] don't know exactly so rough estimate how
[57:51] many times have you swung a hammer no
[57:55] clue
[57:57] a lot now you all know our brother but
[58:01] to prove the point our brother has a
[58:02] little experience with this tool we all
[58:06] agree now I'm going to ask you brother
[58:09] specifically as you started to say
[58:11] specifically what is this it's a hammer
[58:14] what kind of hammer is it it's a framing
[58:18] hammer what what other aspects does it
[58:21] have you start to say about the face and
[58:25] different we talking about the name of
[58:27] the hammer or what it does name of the
[58:28] hammer it's an ox Hammer treat treat us
[58:31] treat us like we don't know anything
[58:32] about Hammer okay so this is a 22 o
[58:34] framing hammer it's a straight claw
[58:36] hammer and not a curved claw hammer
[58:38] which is typically used for uh framing
[58:41] for the most part the face of it is
[58:43] actually a checkered face instead of a
[58:45] smooth face you wouldn't use that for
[58:47] trimming anything because then you'd
[58:49] have what we call mule tracks left
[58:50] behind when uh when you drive that in so
[58:54] uh and it's a has a wood hand handle
[58:57] which today is kind of looked down on
[58:59] cuz it causes a lot of vibration that
[59:01] goes all the way through you and ruins
[59:02] your shoulders I have to get a new
[59:05] Hammer
[59:07] yeah 20 you need a 22nd century
[59:11] Hammer so you can use it to drive
[59:14] Nails uh you can use it to persuade
[59:18] boards to go where they don't want to go
[59:20] you can use it to uh pull nails if
[59:22] they're crooked or need to come back out
[59:24] again and uh sometimes we use it like a
[59:26] hatchet because it is a straight
[59:29] claw
[59:31] so what type of work or how big of work
[59:34] could you do with this
[59:36] Hammer how big of work is in what what
[59:39] types of things could you build with a
[59:41] hammer like this or would you use a
[59:42] hammer in the
[59:44] process uh I mean the size of it
[59:46] wouldn't matter because you start with
[59:49] one piece at a time so sure yeah so you
[59:51] could build small you you mentioned it
[59:54] would be a finishing Hammer might be a
[59:55] little bit smaller on the scale of
[59:57] hammers how big is this Hammer fairly
[59:59] large for until you get into the big
[1:00:02] hammers but as far as Hammer that you're
[1:00:05] going to use every day it's it's fairly
[1:00:06] large okay so let me ask you this one
[1:00:09] have you ever hit yourself with this
[1:00:11] Hammer a hammer like this not this
[1:00:13] Hammer but Hammer like
[1:00:16] this a hammer like this one like this
[1:00:18] yes did it hurt most of the time
[1:00:23] yes how bad did it hurt
[1:00:26] on a scale of 10 sometimes it's a 10 it
[1:00:29] depends how you hit
[1:00:30] yourself sometimes it's a three so let
[1:00:33] ask you this if someone wanted to do
[1:00:36] damage how much damage could they do
[1:00:38] with this Hammer a tremendous amount
[1:00:41] yeah like you said you could rip things
[1:00:43] apart with it you could probably kill
[1:00:46] someone with that hammer I'm sure it it
[1:00:48] could be a very dangerous element sure
[1:00:52] right okay
[1:00:54] so we're going to right here
[1:01:03] now now brother what is what is
[1:01:06] this I have no
[1:01:08] [Laughter]
[1:01:13] clue I'm not sure I've ever seen one of
[1:01:16] them
[1:01:18] before looks like it's a holder for a
[1:01:20] screwdriver look at
[1:01:24] that so what could could you do with
[1:01:27] this I mean it's a hammer after all
[1:01:30] right you could probably put a very
[1:01:33] small nail into drywall to hang a
[1:01:35] picture with that
[1:01:38] hammer could you build a house using
[1:01:41] that it would take a long
[1:01:43] time he's being very generous very
[1:01:46] generous I mean
[1:01:48] I yeah it'd be tough it would be tough
[1:01:51] yeah it'd be tough so how does this
[1:01:54] compare to that
[1:01:57] as far as
[1:01:58] usefulness as far as the East is from
[1:02:01] the West it doesn't compare it doesn't
[1:02:04] compare yeah no I so which one would you
[1:02:07] rather have on a job site then we
[1:02:09] already know the answer but go ahead
[1:02:11] brother brother the Joe does his hammer
[1:02:13] look
[1:02:16] familiar I would rather have that on a
[1:02:18] job site because that one's useful right
[1:02:21] yeah it has a purpose it was made for a
[1:02:22] purpose and while we probably need a
[1:02:25] better hand
[1:02:27] more updated handle the type of hammer
[1:02:30] does a tremendous amount of work it
[1:02:32] could do a lot of damage but it could
[1:02:33] also do a tremendous amount of work
[1:02:36] that's what I needed brother not much
[1:02:38] damage with
[1:02:41] that
[1:02:48] so
[1:02:51] God made a
[1:02:54] man to be this
[1:02:59] man was
[1:03:00] formed to have a tremendous amount of
[1:03:03] potential to
[1:03:06] build but a man is always also made the
[1:03:10] inherent nature of the ability to build
[1:03:14] also means the ability to
[1:03:18] destroy this is
[1:03:21] dangerous that the world has come up
[1:03:24] with an answer
[1:03:26] to this problem as they see
[1:03:30] it God formed man to be a man to be
[1:03:34] masculine to be
[1:03:36] tough to be able to build things to
[1:03:38] create things to to put the wood
[1:03:42] together but he can also hurt destroy
[1:03:46] damage
[1:03:48] kill it's a dangerous thing so the world
[1:03:51] has looked at this danger and the world
[1:03:53] has said that's so dangerous
[1:03:57] we want instead of this we want
[1:04:03] this do you see the
[1:04:06] problem this is not made for the
[1:04:10] job God made a man with a purpose to
[1:04:14] protect a family care for a family and
[1:04:16] when the bear comes you go get eaten
[1:04:18] first
[1:04:21] yeah yeah that's your job Brothers take
[1:04:25] it up yes God called you to stand at the
[1:04:29] door and when the Devil Comes you say no
[1:04:31] no no you have to go through me first
[1:04:34] God called a man to be a real man not to
[1:04:38] be some diminished sissified
[1:04:43] version because you lose its
[1:04:50] value but now
[1:04:52] Brothers God made us
[1:04:56] to be
[1:04:59] this and we get in a relationship and we
[1:05:01] get
[1:05:02] married and then your wife starts
[1:05:05] crying and you just want to fix
[1:05:09] it and you're like here I am what's the
[1:05:14] problem how do you think that's going to
[1:05:16] go
[1:05:18] over now be honest now Brothers how many
[1:05:21] have done
[1:05:22] this look around young men there there's
[1:05:25] a testimony and what happens when you
[1:05:28] try to fix the flower with the
[1:05:34] hammer yeah you hear the testimony other
[1:05:37] brothers already testifying it's the
[1:05:38] truth right we get ourselves in trouble
[1:05:41] because we're trying to apply the way
[1:05:44] God made us in the wrong way amen we're
[1:05:48] trying to fix the problems of the Heart
[1:05:52] by changing the form of the heart
[1:05:56] amen but God formed already something
[1:06:00] special yeah God does not need your
[1:06:03] personality to change the form of it
[1:06:07] that doesn't mean you don't interact
[1:06:09] that don't me doesn't mean you don't
[1:06:10] have a part but it means you cannot
[1:06:12] change the form the maker has already
[1:06:14] made the
[1:06:16] form God made your wife as a jewel amen
[1:06:21] and God forbid someone might say well
[1:06:23] not my wife
[1:06:25] well brother why don't you treat her
[1:06:27] like
[1:06:28] one you treat her like one and you see
[1:06:31] what
[1:06:31] happens or it might take a while but see
[1:06:35] Brothers we never want to admit that
[1:06:36] we're the one that accidentally smashed
[1:06:39] someone's
[1:06:43] toe what' you do that for well I was
[1:06:46] fixing a problem you got in the
[1:06:50] way
[1:06:52] right not my fault I'm just being who
[1:06:55] God made me to
[1:06:57] be and sometimes in a
[1:07:01] relationship we go at the flower we go
[1:07:03] at the heart we say now wife you're
[1:07:06] crying there's a problem but see we try
[1:07:09] to fix the
[1:07:11] heart and the only thing that the hammer
[1:07:14] can do to the heart is hurt the heart
[1:07:17] that's all it can
[1:07:19] do so what are we supposed to
[1:07:22] do I can't fix this this if this if this
[1:07:27] plant were dying it's fake so it can't
[1:07:30] die but if it were
[1:07:33] dying what could I do I can't change it
[1:07:36] with a hammer is not going to do me any
[1:07:37] good but you know what I can do with a
[1:07:39] hammer in the middle here in uh in Ohio
[1:07:42] it might be the middle of December you
[1:07:44] know what I could do I could build a
[1:07:47] greenhouse I could build a safe
[1:07:51] environment so that the heart doesn't
[1:07:55] have to go through the heartache that
[1:07:57] it's going
[1:07:59] through and sometimes Brothers we need
[1:08:01] to create a safe environment for our
[1:08:04] home and you God did not call you to be
[1:08:08] this to make your home well I got to be
[1:08:11] a little bit more you know sissified no
[1:08:13] you don't I'm not saying don't be gentle
[1:08:15] where it's appropriate I'm not saying
[1:08:17] that the Bible instructs us to be gentle
[1:08:19] to all men but there's a part in US
[1:08:22] brothers and sisters that gets so
[1:08:24] corrupted because men are walking around
[1:08:27] trying to fix a problem that you can't
[1:08:30] fix
[1:08:33] directly God did not make the woman
[1:08:36] directly he made her inside of
[1:08:39] Adam and then Drew her
[1:08:42] out but we want to just make it it's a
[1:08:45] problem I'm going to fix it and we can't
[1:08:48] figure out why we cause
[1:08:53] problems right
[1:08:56] but now if we have a the problem is not
[1:08:59] the hammer who made the hammer the maker
[1:09:03] that's right how much Authority does he
[1:09:05] have absolute right he did not make a
[1:09:09] mistake when he made the hammer the only
[1:09:12] problem is what is the hammer
[1:09:17] hitting because in the hands of a
[1:09:19] skilled Craftsman that hammer can make
[1:09:22] beautiful things in the hands of a
[1:09:25] psychopath it can
[1:09:27] kill right it only matters who wields
[1:09:31] it but God has formed these things has
[1:09:35] formed the gentleness and the the the
[1:09:37] capability of being a mother in a woman
[1:09:40] and the world has looked at it and says
[1:09:41] I don't care about that what I care is
[1:09:44] about you go and make a second income so
[1:09:46] we can have a two income home and we can
[1:09:48] live like the Joneses no offense if
[1:09:50] there's any Joneses
[1:09:52] here
[1:09:54] right yeah the only reason why that
[1:09:56] continues is because and understand
[1:09:59] financially there's times where that's
[1:10:01] necessary we're not talking about that
[1:10:02] we're talking about when the choices of
[1:10:04] the individuals they're choosing that
[1:10:07] over something else and the reason for
[1:10:09] it is because the Beauty and the
[1:10:11] gentleness and the incredible beauty of
[1:10:14] what God made is not
[1:10:18] appreciated see if you're if God Made
[1:10:21] You Brothers if God made you to be
[1:10:22] Hammer but you don't understand that
[1:10:25] that woman that God gave you to live
[1:10:27] with is his
[1:10:29] daughter if you think first and foremost
[1:10:32] that's my wife I can do whatever I want
[1:10:33] you have a world of problems yeah amen
[1:10:36] but when you enter every conversation in
[1:10:38] life you understand first and foremost
[1:10:41] she's a daughter of the Living God again
[1:10:44] you might say well brother my spouse is
[1:10:45] not converted treat her like that
[1:10:48] anyway she'll never experience like have
[1:10:52] an experience like that anywhere else in
[1:10:54] the world because if you're treating her
[1:10:57] the way that God treats you yeah amen
[1:11:01] amen that's right well my wife did this
[1:11:04] and and I just I got to straighten
[1:11:05] things
[1:11:08] up God doesn't come to you after you're
[1:11:11] converted God doesn't come to you and
[1:11:12] said yeah I made a mistake when I made
[1:11:15] you you need to dramatically change who
[1:11:18] you are I said after you're converted
[1:11:22] when you're converted God comes to you
[1:11:24] and he expresses
[1:11:25] his plan to you he expresses his Plan of
[1:11:29] Redemption he Woos you and he never
[1:11:33] stops we've said this before and it's
[1:11:35] just something that's blessed my heart
[1:11:37] did you know that love is not an
[1:11:41] emotion but love brings
[1:11:44] emotion and without emotion Love Is
[1:11:49] Dead doesn't that put us in such a
[1:11:52] perfect spot we can't be off to the left
[1:11:55] we can't be off to the right because you
[1:11:57] say you love your spouse and you have no
[1:11:59] emotion when they walk in the room you
[1:12:00] have a problem yes I'm just being very
[1:12:03] blunt with you today is that okay right
[1:12:05] we have a problem Saints you can't
[1:12:07] change something you can't grow if you
[1:12:09] don't acknowledge I need to
[1:12:11] grow right and I'm not certainly not
[1:12:13] talking down to anybody I'm not trying
[1:12:15] to beat anybody up what I'm saying is
[1:12:17] this is the reality of the world that we
[1:12:19] live in why is the devil attacking
[1:12:23] this amen because if you have a
[1:12:25] revelation of your relationship between
[1:12:28] you and God then that Revelation must
[1:12:31] translate into everyday
[1:12:34] life you cannot treat your family like
[1:12:37] garbage and then claim to have a
[1:12:39] revelation of who God
[1:12:41] is you can have all kinds of spiritual
[1:12:44] experiences tell me all kinds of
[1:12:45] testimonies and if your family is not
[1:12:47] care for that you you don't care about
[1:12:49] your family I'm not talking about just
[1:12:50] making a mistake I'm saying you don't
[1:12:52] care yeah amen you know why I'm
[1:12:55] preaching these things brother sister
[1:12:57] because these are things that I love my
[1:12:59] family I love my wife I love my children
[1:13:01] but these are things that I look at
[1:13:02] myself and I I look at myself personally
[1:13:04] and I think I'm not a very good husband
[1:13:07] when I look at how good God is when I
[1:13:09] compare myself to
[1:13:13] him Lord Jesus well we're we're focused
[1:13:17] on just growing spiritually we want to
[1:13:18] grow in Revelation praise the Lord I
[1:13:21] understand this I'm not knocking that
[1:13:23] now just making a point yeah we get so
[1:13:26] caught up in that that we miss that the
[1:13:29] revelation God is giving us is to change
[1:13:31] the way we act it's supposed to change
[1:13:34] the way we conduct
[1:13:36] ourselves we should not be conducting
[1:13:38] ourselves the way we did 5 years ago we
[1:13:41] should be more mature we should be more
[1:13:43] gentle when it's appropriate we should
[1:13:44] stand we should have a
[1:13:47] backbone the world will tell you as a
[1:13:49] man that you shouldn't have a backbone
[1:13:50] you should be like this that's right
[1:13:53] well don't disagree with somebody you're
[1:13:54] going to hurt their feelings Brothers we
[1:13:56] are at the point where we should be able
[1:13:58] to disagree right we should look each
[1:14:01] other in the eye disagree on doctrinal
[1:14:07] things I can't talk to that person they
[1:14:09] see that
[1:14:10] different did brother brandham ever have
[1:14:13] that attitude not a single
[1:14:15] time brother brandham never did it how
[1:14:18] can we have it
[1:14:19] then right because we want to get in
[1:14:22] there the truth is we want to fix it
[1:14:24] that's right yeah come on now well they
[1:14:26] believe it different so I'm just going
[1:14:27] to throw out I'm going to throw out
[1:14:30] seeds what we're doing is really poking
[1:14:32] that
[1:14:33] person yeah yeah this and this and this
[1:14:36] and you know it's getting a reaction I
[1:14:38] say you Brothers brothers that are here
[1:14:40] I say I say that sisters could do it too
[1:14:43] but sometimes we are prone to do that as
[1:14:46] brothers right but we have to understand
[1:14:49] that we set the right environment that
[1:14:51] we have given been given incredible
[1:14:54] power amen now sisters we're getting a
[1:14:57] more for you
[1:14:59] okay sometimes we
[1:15:01] brothers sisters just maybe let you let
[1:15:04] you in on a little secret sometimes we
[1:15:06] Brothers we need someone to
[1:15:09] say put your big boy pants
[1:15:13] on Brothers am I right there's sometimes
[1:15:16] there's something in us that says yes
[1:15:18] you know what you're right you're right
[1:15:22] I did do that I've got enough integrity
[1:15:25] and humility to admit it and you know
[1:15:26] what I'm not going to stay the
[1:15:29] same cuz there's one person that I can
[1:15:32] change that's this guy right
[1:15:35] here and as much as God will give me
[1:15:37] Grace I can take that personality that I
[1:15:39] have I don't want to drop that on my
[1:15:40] computer there it can do damage maybe
[1:15:43] you didn't catch that this can do damage
[1:15:46] but I I can apply everything that God
[1:15:48] made me to be I can apply that to myself
[1:15:51] right so sometimes we men we need some
[1:15:53] tough talk a little bit and it's good
[1:15:55] for us no I'm not saying you understand
[1:15:57] what I'm saying I don't I don't believe
[1:15:59] in going so far and being disrespectful
[1:16:01] or abuse one another that's not godly
[1:16:04] but there's a there's just an honest
[1:16:06] about being men that makes you stand up
[1:16:08] a little straighter it's good to be
[1:16:10] around a man that's got good Integrity
[1:16:11] who and talk straight I think every man
[1:16:14] in here there's probably older men that
[1:16:16] you might respect and they're just men
[1:16:18] sometimes quietly but they speak the
[1:16:20] truth you think Lord I want to be more
[1:16:22] like that I personally think I talk too
[1:16:25] much when I get older you know what I I
[1:16:27] pray I said Lord Lord when I get older I
[1:16:29] want to talk less but say
[1:16:31] more and as I get older I want to ask
[1:16:34] more
[1:16:35] questions because sometimes we're doing
[1:16:37] this what we're doing is really we're
[1:16:39] trying to fix a
[1:16:42] problem instead of inviting into the
[1:16:46] right
[1:16:46] atmosphere so that the Sovereign God one
[1:16:50] plants one Waters but God gives the
[1:16:52] increase so that the Sovereign God can
[1:16:55] make the difference that's what our
[1:16:57] homes should
[1:16:59] be but
[1:17:03] now thank you brother John that was
[1:17:05] wonderful spur of the
[1:17:07] moment we've talked about the
[1:17:10] hammer can the hammer change the form of
[1:17:13] the
[1:17:14] plant it's not made for that God set the
[1:17:18] form of the heart God set the form of
[1:17:21] the woman to be precious to be gentle
[1:17:23] why so she could love those children in
[1:17:25] a way that you never can a mother can be
[1:17:28] a mother Brothers we can't be a mother
[1:17:30] you can't do that for your children
[1:17:33] because God made a woman specially to be
[1:17:39] that now let's go to Mark chapter
[1:17:45] 6 we we okay so far praise the Lord
[1:17:55] we're still going somewhere we're not
[1:17:57] there
[1:18:02] yet Mark chapter
[1:18:19] 6 just say Amen when you find your place
[1:18:21] there praise the Lord uh Mark chapter 6
[1:18:25] let's read verses uh 2 to 3 and when the
[1:18:27] Sabbath day was come he began to teach
[1:18:29] in the synagogue and many hearing him
[1:18:31] were astonished saying from whence hath
[1:18:34] this man these things and what wisdom is
[1:18:36] this which is given unto him that even
[1:18:38] such Mighty works are wrought at his
[1:18:40] hands is this not the carpenter the son
[1:18:43] of Mary the but brother of James and and
[1:18:46] uh Joseph uh of Judah and Simon and are
[1:18:50] not his sisters here with us and they
[1:18:53] were offended at
[1:18:55] him many times we think about Jesus the
[1:18:59] son of Joseph the
[1:19:02] carpenter that's not what this
[1:19:04] says says isn't he the
[1:19:08] carpenter I want you to think about that
[1:19:10] for a
[1:19:11] moment you mean to tell me that the god
[1:19:13] of
[1:19:14] creation who has the ability to set his
[1:19:17] form in any way he
[1:19:18] wants he condescended he he become the
[1:19:21] logos and then he made all creation and
[1:19:23] when he created a body and stepped into
[1:19:25] that body he he created that he stepped
[1:19:27] into that particular body and he came
[1:19:30] and worked as a
[1:19:32] carpenter why would he do
[1:19:35] that because even in life the character
[1:19:38] of who he is is coming out see he's a
[1:19:42] maker he came to Earth and the the the
[1:19:45] attributes of the father are being
[1:19:47] reflected in this body in this form that
[1:19:50] he formed
[1:19:55] a man can build a
[1:19:59] house a man could go
[1:20:02] and you could build a a beautiful home
[1:20:05] can have the lighting just right you can
[1:20:07] have colder lights and warmer lights you
[1:20:08] can have nice warm lights you can light
[1:20:10] some candles in there and if there's
[1:20:11] nobody there I don't care how much you
[1:20:14] crank up the HVAC it's a cold
[1:20:17] house because something's missing that's
[1:20:21] right a man can build a house
[1:20:26] a man cannot build a
[1:20:30] home a man can take the Timbers and form
[1:20:34] the house pound the nails cut the boards
[1:20:37] put on the siding the shingles etc etc a
[1:20:40] man can do all those things but he
[1:20:43] cannot it's impossible for a man to make
[1:20:46] a house into a home
[1:20:50] yes let's go to Titus Chapter 2 for
[1:21:38] Titus Chapter 2 just the one verse
[1:21:41] there verse number
[1:21:44] five to be discreet this is talking
[1:21:47] about the sisters well let's we'll back
[1:21:49] up a little bit to verse number
[1:21:51] three just to give a little context the
[1:21:54] age women likewise that they be in
[1:21:56] Behavior as becometh Holiness not false
[1:22:00] accusers not given to much wine teaching
[1:22:02] teachers of good things that they may
[1:22:05] teach the young women to be sober to
[1:22:07] love their husbands to love their
[1:22:08] children to be discreet chased keepers
[1:22:12] at home good obedient to their own
[1:22:15] husbands that the word of God be not
[1:22:20] blasphemed so who keeps the home
[1:22:24] not the
[1:22:26] man I mean man has his part of course
[1:22:30] right but this doesn't say this about
[1:22:32] the man says about this about the
[1:22:35] woman this is the
[1:22:39] keeper oh friends
[1:22:41] amen you see you could build a house and
[1:22:44] it's going to be cold why because love
[1:22:45] isn't
[1:22:47] there and the When Love Is
[1:22:52] there when a man when we get married and
[1:22:55] and the woman is there and she's
[1:22:57] starting to keep the home she's caring
[1:22:58] for the home she's cooking in the house
[1:23:02] doing whatever that she's doing in the
[1:23:04] house and maybe the man comes home from
[1:23:06] work and I I know I've come in the house
[1:23:09] before and it smells like something good
[1:23:11] is cooking it just it does something to
[1:23:13] your
[1:23:14] heart you know what but if you take that
[1:23:17] woman out of that home does it stay at
[1:23:20] home it does
[1:23:22] not it is the
[1:23:25] Act of her keeping the home it is the
[1:23:29] act of her keeping the house that makes
[1:23:31] it a home
[1:23:33] amen you say well brother in every
[1:23:35] situation no you can have a marriage
[1:23:37] that has no love in it that's possible
[1:23:39] but we're talking about the way that God
[1:23:41] intended it yes and we'll get to a
[1:23:44] little bit more of that in just a moment
[1:23:45] but just bear with me for a moment you
[1:23:48] see because here we are as men we can do
[1:23:51] a lot of good things God made us this
[1:23:53] way
[1:23:55] but God did not directly create Eve he
[1:23:57] created Adam and Drew Eve from
[1:24:02] him because she had to be made
[1:24:05] special she had to be
[1:24:07] formed
[1:24:09] specially because she had the sacred
[1:24:12] trust to bring forth
[1:24:14] life she was made to be more gentle than
[1:24:18] the
[1:24:21] man well that means she's weak no it
[1:24:24] doesn't
[1:24:24] isn't the Bible talks about a virtuous
[1:24:27] woman she's strong in a different sort
[1:24:29] of way she's not supposed to be
[1:24:32] masculine supposed to be
[1:24:34] feminine and the beauty of what God made
[1:24:37] that woman to
[1:24:38] be is what can transform a collection of
[1:24:42] building
[1:24:43] materials into a place that a man will
[1:24:46] yearn to
[1:24:48] be only her presence there makes it that
[1:24:53] amen
[1:24:56] amen the woman keeping the house makes
[1:24:59] the house a home now let's go to John
[1:25:06] 14 praise the Lord
[1:25:20] Jesus John chapter 14
[1:25:25] praise the Lord oh my blessed be the
[1:25:29] name of the
[1:25:30] Lord what a day what a time to be living
[1:25:33] Saints amen all the ages past they never
[1:25:36] got to see these things right they never
[1:25:39] got to see the whole mind and heart of
[1:25:41] God uh unfolding they got to see only
[1:25:43] that little part we get to see the
[1:25:46] entire mind of God the mystery would be
[1:25:50] finished my John
[1:25:52] 141:4 let not your heart be troubled you
[1:25:55] believe in God believe also in me in my
[1:25:59] father's house are many mansions if it
[1:26:01] were not so I would have told you I go
[1:26:05] to prepare a
[1:26:07] place for
[1:26:09] you and if I go and prepare a place for
[1:26:12] you I will come again and receive you
[1:26:13] unto myself that where I am there you
[1:26:17] may be also and whether I go you know
[1:26:20] and the way you
[1:26:23] know he says I know you know where I'm
[1:26:25] going and you know how to get
[1:26:29] there but he's ascending up to be at the
[1:26:32] right hand of the
[1:26:33] father yeah he's caught up and you know
[1:26:36] how to get
[1:26:37] there and he said I go to prepare a
[1:26:40] place because he is the maker amen you
[1:26:44] see he created he formed but it is the
[1:26:47] process of discovering it is the process
[1:26:50] of the wooing it is the process of
[1:26:52] winning the favor
[1:26:55] that causes love to come out it is the
[1:26:58] process of it God did not just create it
[1:27:01] the Angels Praise Him continuously but
[1:27:03] the Angels don't know
[1:27:05] Redemption they are only bystanders they
[1:27:08] don't know the process they were not
[1:27:10] lost and then
[1:27:13] found but here God is he's looked at us
[1:27:16] and he says you are out in the world I
[1:27:18] never lost you but you were tied up in
[1:27:20] sin you were connected to sin but I came
[1:27:23] along and cut the connection prise God
[1:27:26] and I'm going to prepare a
[1:27:29] place but without
[1:27:33] you amen without
[1:27:36] you it's not good that man dwells
[1:27:39] alone from the beginning God had a
[1:27:42] yearning what is he yearning
[1:27:43] for he's yearning for his house to be a
[1:27:47] home amen amen and how can his house
[1:27:51] become a home it has to be kept yeah
[1:27:55] that's right someone has to keep it amen
[1:27:59] and then there's this little lady that
[1:28:00] comes up out of leod deia prise
[1:28:03] God and she's she meets God and
[1:28:06] something happens in her and spiritually
[1:28:08] speaking she starts walking around like
[1:28:13] this people look at you funny why you
[1:28:15] walk that way why you going to church
[1:28:17] why you dress that way why do you do
[1:28:19] this why do you do
[1:28:20] that groaning to be delivered why
[1:28:23] because something is happening on the
[1:28:25] inside she was given a sacred trust and
[1:28:28] she has kept that sacred trust God has
[1:28:32] given his mind his heart he's put
[1:28:34] everything into her
[1:28:36] hands and she has to keep
[1:28:40] iten hallelujah it's only the Bride of
[1:28:43] Jesus Christ keeping his word that will
[1:28:46] make the house for God because he was
[1:28:49] alone he did not want to be alone he
[1:28:52] wanted to have someone he could turn to
[1:28:54] and say I love you and she says I love
[1:28:59] you because I've known something else I
[1:29:03] knew sin I knew all the other things in
[1:29:05] the world but you gave me your word and
[1:29:08] I kept your word
[1:29:10] amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:29:14] amen that's so beautiful Saints I have
[1:29:17] no words oh my Saints because God gave
[1:29:21] us his word and it rest in your heart
[1:29:23] you you're the
[1:29:25] keeper you Saints you're the keeper of
[1:29:27] his word you're the thing he was looking
[1:29:30] for he wasn't just looking for someone
[1:29:32] who's going to be a good person he
[1:29:34] wanted to have someone who would hold
[1:29:37] him in their
[1:29:39] heart that he could walk within the cool
[1:29:41] of the day he could explain the ins and
[1:29:44] outs of creation look what I built over
[1:29:47] here honey you did that that's
[1:29:52] amazing you should say that to your
[1:29:53] husband husband once in a
[1:29:55] while you did that oh wow that's amazing
[1:30:00] but you know what we won't have to put
[1:30:01] on for God we will look at the Grandeur
[1:30:04] of the heavens and the Earth the
[1:30:06] tapestry of the heavens the tapestry of
[1:30:09] all time and look at God and say your
[1:30:12] creation is
[1:30:13] wonderful the beauty of it is beyond
[1:30:16] compare no one can compare to this
[1:30:19] maker he formed it he made it he made it
[1:30:23] beautiful he formed it why because he
[1:30:25] had a thought in his mind that one
[1:30:27] day someone would appreciate amen amen
[1:30:32] someone would take his word and hold his
[1:30:34] word in their heart and it was the
[1:30:37] process of keeping it that made it
[1:30:42] precious God did not just snap his
[1:30:44] fingers and make a church that loved
[1:30:47] him he wanted to come and woo he wanted
[1:30:52] to win
[1:30:54] so that when you give your heart God is
[1:30:58] the God of all
[1:30:59] creation he can do whatever he wants he
[1:31:01] can form whatever he wants but he didn't
[1:31:03] form just something else he formed
[1:31:05] you who did that the maker did amen well
[1:31:10] I don't like how tall I
[1:31:12] am who made
[1:31:14] you well I don't like my eye color who
[1:31:17] made
[1:31:19] you it doesn't matter what your

[1:31:30] creation that's God's creation well

[1:31:34] and then formed here who caused you to
[1:31:36] be formed
[1:31:38] here we said this in the past I believe
[1:31:40] I mentioned it
[1:31:42] here who who defined Jesus's eye
[1:31:45] color who defined that every detail is
[1:31:50] of God Amen every detail about you is of
[1:31:53] god

[1:31:56] you we get caught up in our insecurities
[1:31:58] I want you to take your step back from
[1:32:00] your insecurities brother sister take a
[1:32:02] step back and realize that it was the
[1:32:04] maker that formed you in that genetics
[1:32:07] the moment you were conceived it was
[1:32:09] already written how tall you were going
[1:32:11] to be what your eye color was how
[1:32:13] astounding is that the maker did it he's
[1:32:17] forming he's building and the at least
[1:32:20] as his bride we look at his creation and
[1:32:22] say Lord you you are amazing amen amen
[1:32:26] you are the maker you set the form you
[1:32:28] set the limitation you created even this
[1:32:31] thing that's wicked that chose to be
[1:32:33] Wicked Lucifer fell you put us in the
[1:32:35] world why so that we could overcome amen
[1:32:39] if there was no temptation you couldn't
[1:32:42] keep
[1:32:43] it but you were put here as God's most
[1:32:47] precious
[1:32:49] thought so that you would come through
[1:32:51] the process fall in love with with him
[1:32:54] and then keep his word amen hold it
[1:32:59] sacred and in it God would win what he
[1:33:04] was
[1:33:05] after we've looked at
[1:33:10] today well before we we we'll draw to
[1:33:14] close here in a few minutes 1965 things
[1:33:17] that are to be oh but the other one is
[1:33:19] called my father's house I'll go and
[1:33:22] prepare a place for you
[1:33:24] take you out of this pest house now
[1:33:27] let's stop for a
[1:33:28] moment let's read this like a love
[1:33:32] letter from
[1:33:35] God oh but the other one is called my
[1:33:37] father's house I'll go to prepare a
[1:33:39] place for you take you out of this pest

[1:33:45] house amen there you are take you out of
[1:33:48] this old Earthly pest house he's gone to
[1:33:50] prepare a place a perfect place where no
[1:33:53] evil exists no sickness exists no old
[1:33:57] age exists no death
[1:34:01] exists a perfect place calling you to
[1:34:04] that Perfection you have to be perfect
[1:34:07] to get there the Bible said so Jesus
[1:34:10] said be you therefore perfect even as
[1:34:13] your father in Heaven is perfect it's a
[1:34:16] perfect Kingdom so it must be perfect
[1:34:19] must be a perfect people to come amen
[1:34:23] because because you have to stand and be
[1:34:26] married to a perfect Son of God and you
[1:34:30] must be a perfect bride so how can you
[1:34:33] do it through anything else but the
[1:34:35] perfect word of God which is the Waters
[1:34:37] of Separation that washes us from our
[1:34:40] sins amen that's right the blood of
[1:34:43] Jesus Christ think of it the dripping
[1:34:45] bloody word amen the word the the word
[1:34:47] of God bleeding word to wash the bride
[1:34:49] in amen yes sir she stands perfect amen

[1:34:57] sinned in the first place praise God
[1:35:01] Amen she was trapped yeah into it
[1:35:05] amen there's the father's house that
[1:35:09] he's gone to
[1:35:14] prepare the hammer and the
[1:35:17] heart God with all authority to form to
[1:35:21] create to change he set you set your
[1:35:26] limitations God did not make a mistake
[1:35:28] he's never made a mistake we look at our
[1:35:30] ourselves and think what a mistake but I
[1:35:32] challenge you today the maker made
[1:35:35] you he formed you knew you before you
[1:35:38] were
[1:35:40] born today it says we will cover but we
[1:35:44] have covered the
[1:35:46] maker God is the maker he formed there
[1:35:49] is no Authority that he is subject to he
[1:35:52] is the highest author Authority all
[1:35:55] things created are subject to the
[1:35:57] Maker's
[1:35:58] Authority he created the heart the woman
[1:36:02] he's created to be to uh to to bring
[1:36:05] forth life with a sacred trust to bring
[1:36:07] forth those the the the life that
[1:36:09] nothing else can the man can't do it man
[1:36:12] might be involved in the process but he
[1:36:13] can't do it he can't bring forth the
[1:36:15] life she's made to be a mother to be
[1:36:18] caring and people have confused us to be
[1:36:20] the Lesser V she's not lesser she was
[1:36:23] made precious to be
[1:36:26] precious to care for the young ones to
[1:36:29] care for loved ones in a way that a man
[1:36:31] never
[1:36:33] could excuse me the hammer we were made
[1:36:37] menant you were made with potential to
[1:36:40] be dangerous potential to hurt to
[1:36:42] potential to harm and the world wants
[1:36:44] you instead of being
[1:36:46] this a framing
[1:36:49] hammer something that could build and
[1:36:51] destroy the world wants you to be this
[1:36:56] but God didn't make
[1:36:57] that that's a cheap copy of what God
[1:37:02] made and then God made us the church as
[1:37:07] a type of course our sisters as a
[1:37:09] beautiful type of what God has made that
[1:37:10] God has made the church to keep his word
[1:37:13] to hold his word and it is the keeping
[1:37:16] of his word that God was after this
[1:37:18] whole time someone that would love his
[1:37:20] word to care for it to care for it to
[1:37:24] yeah praise God to nurture it so it
[1:37:26] would
[1:37:27] grow to care for it
[1:37:30] amen to bring forth life yes Lord and
[1:37:34] every little punctuation amen I care
[1:37:38] about that amen amen I care about
[1:37:41] that why why are you so sensitive about
[1:37:44] his word cuz I'm the keeper
[1:37:47] amen God gave me his word so that I
[1:37:50] could keep his word
[1:37:55] can you see the vision of that
[1:37:58] Simplicity God handed us his word he
[1:38:00] says now you keep it and it's you
[1:38:03] keeping it that's
[1:38:08] precious prise God God is
[1:38:12] good the hammer in the
[1:38:15] heart that the musicians come if you

[1:55:44] a privilege friends I'm thankful that it
[1:55:47] was spelled out so clear today we could
[1:55:49] find our part in the great drama
[1:55:53] when you think about a woman who becomes

[1:55:58] everything she gives everything to bring
[1:56:00] forth life she gives everything to keep
[1:56:02] the home she gives her ambition she
[1:56:04] gives her time she gives everything and
[1:56:06] surrender and she keeps The Treasure of
[1:56:09] the home and she keeps the seed and she
[1:56:12] brings it forth she does it all
[1:56:13] sacrificially in a full surrender that's
[1:56:16] the part I want to play I want to
[1:56:19] surrender I want to be sacrificial I
[1:56:21] want to give up my ition my time my
[1:56:23] thoughts my everything just to surrender
[1:56:26] to my maker to take his word and hold it
[1:56:29] dear to my heart and give my life so
[1:56:31] that that word can express I want to
[1:56:34] nurture it and hold it and love it and
