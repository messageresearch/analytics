[0:00] This experience of former and latter
[0:02] reign, it took place in the prophet's
[0:05] ministry
[0:07] &gt;&gt; because it fell in the end time. It fell
[0:09] through that prophetic ministry. The
[0:11] former and latter rain fell together. So
[0:13] we can stand here and say this day this
[0:16] scripture is fulfilled in your eyes,
[0:18] &gt;&gt; in your ears. It's it's it's already
[0:20] done. But listen, we each have our own
[0:22] experience of former and latter reign.
[0:25] Every bride member has an experience of
[0:28] former and latter reign because I wasn't
[0:30] there in 1962, 63, 60. I came along much
[0:35] later in 1999 in year 2000. But oh,
[0:38] praise God. I had a revival when I saw
[0:41] the restoration of the word when I
[0:43] realized that what had happened to my
[0:44] Bible and what my church was teaching me
[0:46] was wrong and what the truth was. I had
[0:48] a revival. Amen. But then I got stuck
[0:51] between two revivals. Yes,
[0:54] &gt;&gt; I realized what the truth was. I
[0:56] realized what the word was. I realized
[0:57] what the church that happened to the
[0:58] church. I realized that there was a
[1:00] restoration. Amen. But then what about
[1:02] me? Amen. Now all of a sudden I was
[1:04] coming back lining up with the word.
[1:06] Baptized, right? Understood the nature
[1:07] of God. Amen. Understood the church ages
[1:09] and all that. But I had to have a latter
[1:11] reign experience myself. I had to have
[1:14] the breath of God descend upon me. I had
[1:16] to realize what the mystery was laying
[1:18] under those seals. And the great mystery
[1:20] of God under those seals was that I was
[1:22] part of that being. I was part of that
[1:24] life and his life wanted to express in
[1:26] me.
[1:28] &gt;&gt; And talk about a breath, friends. Talk
[1:30] about another word of prophecy, another
[1:32] boost. Amen. Now she's standing on her
[1:34] feet and marching to Zion.
[1:37] &gt;&gt; And this latter former and latter rain,
[1:39] yes, it's history. Yes, it fell in the
[1:41] same day. Amen. But it's still available
[1:43] to anybody who still needs a revival, an
[1:46] awakening. And until all of the bride is
[1:48] awakened. You can still have a former
[1:50] latter rain experience, friends.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; You young people can have a former
[1:54] latter rain experience. Don't get stuck
[1:57] between two revivals. It's all dying
[1:59] down. It's all getting dry. If you're in
[2:01] that place and you believe the word and
[2:02] believe what you've been taught and you
[2:04] know the restoration of the word, I
[2:06] encourage you, keep feeding on the
[2:08] message, keep praying for revelation
[2:10] because there's a latter rain that has
[2:12] to come next. And if not, you'll just be
[2:14] a dead church member standing on your
[2:16] feet looking like an army member but
[2:18] with no life in you.
[2:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21] &gt;&gt; This revival is still available to the
[2:23] bride.
[2:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so glad I had my experience, but
[2:27] I'm not done with the latter rain yet. I
[2:29] love it when he breathes on me fresh. I
[2:31] love it when it comes fresh again. When
[2:33] I go back to the message of the hour and
[2:36] revelation starts pouring in all over
[2:38] again. It thrills my soul. I'm not done
[2:41] with my latter rain revival.
[2:44] &gt;&gt; Lord
[2:44] &gt;&gt; because it's through that revival he's
[2:46] going to bring me into every promised
[2:48] work and every manifestation he wants to
[2:50] do. And it's not going to be me doing
[2:52] one bit of it because he left his work
[2:54] to do in her in this specific time. And
[2:57] now he has to do it in and through the
[2:59] bride. That's why he's brought his life
[3:01] back, his breath back, his spirit back
[3:04] &gt;&gt; so that he can have a vessel to work in.
[3:06] And I just want to be that vessel.
[3:08] [Music]
[3:10] I don't want to mess it up by adding my
[3:11] own works. I don't know what he wants to
[3:13] do next. I don't know how to do what he
[3:15] wants to do. I have no capability in my
[3:17] flesh to do and in my mind to figure it
[3:19] out. But I want him to have preeminence
[3:21] because that's the great purpose he's
[3:23] looking for in this day. That
[3:24] preeminence in a group of people
[3:27] &gt;&gt; so that through that revival, he can
[3:29] bring the final manifestation of his
[3:32] life on this earth.
